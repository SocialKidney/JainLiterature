**Illumination**

One of the primary and creative objectives of the Shri Marudhar Kesari Sahitya Prakashan Samiti is to publish literature related to Jainism and philosophy. The institution's guiding light, the revered founder, Late Shri Marudhar Kesariji Maharaj, was himself a great scholar, impromptu poet, and a propagator of the essence of Jainism and philosophy. Under his guidance, the institution's various philanthropic activities continue to this day. Gurudev Shri was both a connoisseur and a lover of literature. Inspired by him, we have published numerous works including discourses, biographies, poetry, Agamas, and profound critical analyses. Now, we are presenting the second edition of the Karmagranth Part 6 to scholars and inquisitive readers.

Karmagranth is a great text of Jain philosophy. It encompasses a comprehensive discussion of Jain metaphysics. ...

Under the guidance of the revered Late Gurudev Shri, renowned scholars of Jain philosophy and literature, Editor Shri Shri Chandji Surana and his associate Shri Devkumarji Jain, have collaboratively edited this profound text. Its first edition was published in 1976, which has long been exhausted, and the demand from readers has been constant. In response to the readers' demand, the committee's workers sought permission for the second edition from the founder Shri Rupchandji Maharaj and the co-founder Shri Sukhanmuniji Maharaj. Accordingly, with the approval and inspiration of Gurudev Shri, this second edition is now presented to the readers. It is hoped that those who are curious about the theory of Karma, students, etc., will benefit from it.

**Sincerely,**

**Minister, Shri Marudhar Kesari Sahitya Prakashan Samiti**

The key to understanding Jain philosophy is the 'Karma Siddhanta'. It is certain that the basis of the entire philosophy and metaphysics is the 'Karma Siddhanta', which reveals the mystery of the various states and forms of the soul and its transformations. Therefore, to understand Jain philosophy, it is essential to understand the 'Karma Siddhanta'.

The major texts that discuss the 'Karma Siddhanta' include the 'Karma Granth' written by Shrimad Devendrasuri, which holds a special significance. They occupy a very important place in Jain literature. Even those who are curious about metaphysics consider the 'Karma Granth' as a subject for daily study and self-study, like the Agamas.

The Sanskrit commentaries on the 'Karma Granth' are very important. There have also been many Gujarati translations of them. The first commentary on the 'Karma Granth' in Hindi was presented by the learned scholar, the wise and great Pandit Sukhlalji. His style is comparative and scholarly. Pandit Sukhlalji's commentary is now almost inaccessible. For some time, there has been inspiration from Ashukatriratna Gurudev Shri Marudhar Kesariji Maharaj to present a commentary on the 'Karma Granth' in a modern style. This compilation began under his inspiration and guidance. With the inspiration of Vidya Vinod Shri Mukanmuniji, this work progressed rapidly. The cooperation of Shri Devkumarji Jain was received and the work became ready to take shape in a short time.

In this compilation work, the ancient text writers, commentators, commentators, and especially the works of Pandit Shri Sukhlalji, have contributed...

The soul is the foundation of all the thinking, contemplation and deliberation of Jain philosophy. The soul is an all-powerful, independent force. It is the creator of its own happiness and sorrow, and it is also the one who experiences the fruits of its actions. The soul itself is formless, perfectly pure, but it is embodied with the body and wanders in the world in an impure state. Even though it is itself the embodiment of supreme bliss, it is being ground in the cycle of happiness and sorrow. Even though it is immortal, it is flowing in the stream of birth and death. The soul, which is endowed with supreme power, is also suffering in the form of the poor, the miserable, and the destitute. What is the reason for this?

Jain philosophy, while examining this reason, says that karma is what makes the soul wander in the world. Karma is the root of birth and death - "Kammam cha jai maranassa mulaṃ" - this statement of Bhagwan Shri Mahavira is literally true, a fact. Due to karma, this world is constantly changing in its diverse and strange cycles of events. While theistic philosophies have attributed this diversity of the world and happiness and sorrow to God, Jain philosophy has attributed the cause of all happiness and sorrow and the diversity of the world primarily to the soul and its main helper, karma. Karma is not an independent force, it is itself pudgala, inert. But when karma is performed by the soul, which is under the influence of attachment and aversion, it becomes so powerful and potent that it binds the doer in its own bondage. It makes the master dance like a servant. This is the strange power of karma. What is karma, the main seed of all the changes in our life and the world, what is its nature? How do its various results come about? This is a very serious subject. In Jain philosophy,

Karma has been described in great detail. A very subtle and profound analysis of karma is found in the Jain Agamas and subsequent texts. Being in Prakrit and Sanskrit languages, it is indeed for the learned, but it is difficult to understand for the ordinary inquirer. Ancient Acharyas have woven together the various forms of karma theory in chunks, which proves to be a good source of knowledge for the ordinary seeker of truth when memorized.
The Karmagranth holds an important place in the ancient texts on karma theory. The five parts of this work written by Shrimad Devendrasur are extremely voluminous. They present a discussion of all the karmavada, gunasthan, margana, jiva, ajibh, etc. that are in accordance with Jain philosophy. The text is in complex Prakrit language and many commentaries on it in Sanskrit are also famous. Its discussion in Gujarati is also quite famous. Pandit Shri Sukhlalji, a famous scholar and sage, had prepared a discussion on it in Hindi language about 40 years ago.
Currently, the Hindi discussion of Karmagranth was becoming difficult to obtain, and by this time, the style of discussion had also changed considerably. Many seeker of truth Muni and devout Shravak had been requesting for many years from the most revered Gurudev Marudhar Kesariji Maharaj Saheb that a new style discussion and publication of such a vast and serious text like Karmagranth should be done. Only a capable scholar, learned and great saint like you can accomplish this extremely laborious and goal-oriented task. Gurudevshri was also attracted to this and resolved to take this work forward. He started writing the discussion. The responsibility of making the discussion beautiful and interesting from the point of view of language, style, etc., and the tasks of footnotes, collection of references from Agamas, introduction, writing, etc. was given to the famous scholar Shriyut Shrichandji Surana.

This has been entrusted. Shri Suranaji has been in close contact with the literature and thoughts of Gurudev Shri. Under the guidance of Gurudev, he has worked very hard to prepare this scholarly and useful book for the common people. It is fulfilling a long-standing need. At the same time, the society is getting a cultural and philosophical treasure in a new form, which is a matter of great joy.
I have a special interest in this subject. I have been encouraging Gurudev and the editors to complete it from time to time. After five parts, this sixth part is coming before the public today. I am very happy about it.
This sixth part is even more detailed than the previous five parts, the subject is deep, and for clarity of the deep subject, expansion is also necessary. The learned editors have done a thorough examination of the subject with a lot of effort and review of many books. Hopefully, it will be a source of knowledge for inquisitive readers.
Second Edition
Today, after almost 13 years, this second edition of the sixth part of "Karmagranth" is reaching the hands of the readers. Many institutions have included it in their curriculum. This is clear evidence of the usefulness of this book. The book was unavailable for a long time, this year, during the Chaturmas in Madras, it was decided to publish the second edition with the initiator Shri Rupchandji Maharaj Saheb, accordingly, the book is in the hands of the readers.
Our revered Gurudev Shri is not present among us, but wherever he is, his divine power will continue to inspire and guide us. With this auspicious blessing, in the memory of revered Gurudev Shri......

## Introduction

With the presentation of the sixth Kasangraha text, titled 'Saptattika Prakarana', to the readers, the effort of publishing the Karmagranthas is being completed. For this, we congratulate the directors and members of the 'Shri Marudhar Kesari Sahitya Prakashan Samiti' for their commendable effort in publishing this glorious literature, which requires time, labor, and expense, and thus enhancing the glory of Jain literature.

In the introductions of the five previously published Karmagranthas, we have expressed our views on the Karma Siddhanta as much as possible. Here, we present an introduction to the Karmagranthas. The importance of Karmas.

It is sufficient to indicate that the Karmagranthas hold a significant place in Jain literature, as Jain philosophy, while accepting time, nature, etc., as the cause of creation, lays special emphasis on Karmavada. Without understanding the Karma Siddhanta, it is not possible to know the inner secrets of Jain philosophy, and there is no other primary means of acquiring specific knowledge of the Karma element than the Karmagranthas. To study serious texts on Karma literature such as Karmaprakriti, Panchasangraha, etc., it is essential to study the Karmagranthas. Therefore, the Karmagranthas hold a very prestigious place in Jain literature.

(12) Introduction to the Karma Granthas

This chapter of the Saptaatika is the sixth in the order of Karma Granthas. The name of its author is unknown. This text has seventy-two gathas, hence its name Saptaatika, based on the number of gathas. Information about its author, etc., is being given as appropriate. But before that, we present a brief introduction to the five Karma Granthas composed by Shrimad Devendrasuri.

Shrimad Devendrasuri has composed five Karma Granthas named Karmavipak, Karmastav, Bandhaswamitva, Shadshasti, and Shatak, respectively. These five names have been given by the commentator keeping in mind the subject matter of the text and the number of gathas in them. The names of the first, second, and third Karma Granthas are based on their subject matter, while the names of the fourth and fifth Karma Granthas, Shadshasti and Shatak, are based on the number of gathas contained in them. Thus, even though the Karma Granthas have different names, the general public knows them by the names of the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth Karma Granthas.

The Karmavipak, known as the first Karma Grantha, describes the karma of Jnanavarana, Darshanavarana, etc., their distinctions, and their nature, i.e., their vipak or fruit, with illustrations.

The Karmastav, the second Karma Grantha, describes the nature of the fourteen Gunasthanas through the praise of Bhagwan Mahavira and the binding, arising, and existence of the karma-prakritis mentioned in the first Karma Grantha in these Gunasthanas.

The third Karma Grantha, Bandhaswamitva, describes the Bandhaswamitva of the karma-prakritis of the jivas based on the support of the Gatyadis and Marganas. The second Karma Grantha describes the binding based on the Gunasthanas. 

Page #10:
---------------------------
This has been done, while it has considered the idea of bondage ownership based on the paths of motion, etc.
The fourth karma granth called Shadshasti has elaborated on five topics: jiva sthana, margana sthana, guna sthana, bhava and sankhya. Out of these five divisions, the first three divisions describe other related topics. The last two divisions, namely bhava and sankhya, are not mixed with any other topic. Both topics are independent.
The fifth karma granth called Shatak, after classifying the natures described in the first karma granth in many ways like dhrabaddhi, adhra baddhini, dhravodaya, adhra bodaya, etc., has described them in relation to their vipak. After that, the nature, pradesh, sthiti and anubhag bandha of the said natures and their owner have been described. Finally, the special form of upshamani and kshapakneni has been stated. The order of the basis and description
Before the composition of the five karma granths of Shrimad Devendrasuri, six chapters on karma had been composed by different acharyas like Acharya Shivsharma, Chandrashi Mahttar, etc. at different times. Shrimad Devendrasuri has composed his five karma granths based on five of the said six chapters. Therefore, these karma granths are known as 'Navin Karma Granths'.
The ancient karma granth writers have described the topics in their granths and the order of description, almost the same topics and order of description has been kept by Shrimad Devendrasuri. In their composition, only the ancient 

Page #11:
---------------------------
Not only the essence of the Karmagranthas has been taken, but also the name, subject, description style, etc. have been followed. The special feature of the new Karmagranthas is that the ancient Karmagranthakara Acharyas have described the same subjects in their respective granthas, which have been described by the new Karmagranthakara Acharya Shreemad Devendra Suri in his granthas. But the special feature of the Karmagranthas written by Shree Devendra Suri is that the ancient Karmagranthakaras have described the subjects in detail, which may make the practitioners who memorize them feel disinterested, Shree Devendra Suri has presented them in a very concise way through a simple language method without leaving out a single subject and including other subjects in his Karmagranthas. This does not create indifference or disinterest in those who practice. The number of verses in the ancient Karmagranthas is 168, 57, 54, 86 and 102 respectively, and the number of verses in the new Karmagranthas is 60, 34, 24, 86 and 100 respectively. Seeing the same number of verses in the fourth and fifth Karmagranthas, one should not assume that there is nothing else in the new fourth and fifth Karmagranthas except the verbal difference from the ancient fourth and fifth Karmagranthas, but Shreemad Devendra Suri has made his ancient Karmagranthas as concise as possible. After making them concise, he has completed eighty-six and one hundred verses by including other subjects that are helpful for those who practice Karmagranthas, keeping in mind the two ancient names of Sadashiti and Shatak. The fourth Karmagrantha describes the nature of six Bhavas with their differences and varieties, and the number, innumerable and infinite, these three types of numbers, with their descriptions of differences and varieties, and the fifth Karmagrantha 

Page #12:
---------------------------
(15)
This section includes the nature of the three types of *patyopama* - *uddhar*, *addha*, and *kshetra* - as well as the nature of the four types of subtle and gross *pudgala* - *dravya*, *kshetra*, *kala*, and *bhava* - and the nature of the *upashamshreni* and *kshapkasreni*, among other new topics. Thus, the main characteristic of the new *karmagranthas* written by Shri Devendrasuri, compared to the ancient *karmagranthas*, is that they contain all the topics of the ancient *karmagranthas* but are much shorter in length, and also include many new topics.

**Comments on the New *Karmagranthas***

Shrimad Devendrasuri wrote his own commentaries on his new *karmagranthas*, but the commentary on the third *karmagrantha* was lost, and later another learned Acharya wrote a commentary called *Avchuri*.

Shrimad Devendrasuri's commentary style is so engaging that he has discussed every line or sentence of the original text. Not only that, but he has also explained in detail the meaning of any line that required it. In addition, it is also seen that to make the explanation more clear, he has presented relevant evidence from the *Agamas*, *Niyukti*, *Bhashya*, *Nrini*, *Tika*, and *Prakarana Granthas* of the previous Acharyas, as well as quotations from other philosophies. Thus, the commentaries on the new *karmagranthas* are so detailed, well-supported, and full of knowledge of *karmatattva* that after seeing them, the curiosity to see the ancient *karmagranthas* and their commentaries is often satisfied. The language of the commentaries is simple, easy to understand, and clear. 

Page #13:
---------------------------
(16)
After briefly introducing the five Karmagranthas, we now present a special introduction to the Sapttatika (sixth Karmagrantha).

**Introduction to Sapttatika**

The first verse of the Sapttatika briefly hints at the subject matter under consideration. It discusses the eight fundamental karmas and their sub-categories, their effects on the soul, their relation to the Gunasthanas and Marganasthanas, and finally, the methods of pacification (Upshamavidhi) and destruction (Kshapanavidhi).

Karmas have ten possible states, of which three are primary: Bandha (binding), Udaya (arising), and Satya (existence). The remaining states are subsumed within these three. Therefore, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the grantha comprehensively discusses the various states of karmas and their sub-categories.

Considering the size of the grantha, one can only praise the style of its description. The water of the ocean has been filled into a small pitcher. To discuss such vast and profound subjects in such a small grantha is not everyone's work. This proves the greatness of both the author and the grantha.

The first and second verses provide information about the subject matter. The third verse explains the sensory disruption caused by the eight fundamental karmas. The fourth and fifth verses discuss these karmas in relation to the soul and the Gunasthanas respectively. The sixth verse explains the sensory disruption caused by the sub-categories of Jnanavarana and Antarayakarma. The first half of the seventh to ninth verses (two and a half verses) explain the sensory disruption caused by the sub-categories of Darshanavarana. The latter half of the ninth verse explains the sensory disruption caused by Vedaniya, Adhu, and Gotra karmas. 

Page #14:
---------------------------
(17)
The text has promised to describe the destruction of the **mohaniya** (delusive) karmas by simply mentioning their destruction.
From the tenth to the twenty-third verses, the destruction of **mohaniya karma** has been discussed, and from the twenty-fourth to the thirty-second verses, the bondage and other aspects of **nama karma** have been considered, along with their respective sensory destructions. Subsequently, from the thirty-third to the eighty-ninth verses, the aforementioned sensory destructions of the **avantar** (intermediate) natures have been described as occurring in the **jiva** (soul) aggregates and **guna sthana** (quality-places). In the eighty-ninth verse, information has been provided about their occurrence in the eight **anuyaga dvara** (paths of practice), including **gati** (motion) and other **margana** (paths).
After this, the order of the subject matter changes. In the ninety-fourth verse, after explaining the characteristics of the **udaya** (arising) and **udirana** (excitation) **svami** (lord), the ninety-fifth verse lists forty-one **prakriti** (natures) that possess special characteristics. Subsequently, from the ninety-sixth to the sixty-ninth verses, the number of **bandha prakriti** (bondage natures) in each **guna sthana** is indicated. In the sixty-first verse, it is stated that the **tirthankara** (liberated soul), **deva** (celestial being), and **naraka** (hell being) exist only in three **gati** (motions), while the remaining **prakriti** exist in all **gati**. The next two verses provide guidance on the **upasaman** (subduing) and **kshapana** (destruction) of the **ananta anubandhi** (infinitely connected) and **darshan mohaniya** (delusion of perception) **prakriti**, and the sixty-fourth verse describes the specific rules for the **kshapana** of **krodha** (anger) and other **prakriti**. From the sixty-fifth to the seventy-ninth verses, after discussing the **vedana** (feeling) and **udaya** (arising) of **prakriti** in the fourteenth **ayogika kevali** (non-liberated) **guna sthana**, the seventieth verse describes the happiness of the **siddha** (liberated souls).
Thus, after the statement of the subject matter of the text, the last two verses conclude the text by expressing the summary and brevity. 

Page #15:
---------------------------
The Place of Saptaatika in Karma Literature

Based on available evidence, it can be said that the Karma literature available in the Svetambara and Digambara Jain traditions was written based on the fourth Prabhrut of the fifth object of the Agraniyapurva and the Gyanapravad and Karmapravad Purva. Based on the Agraniyapurva, the Shatkhandagam, Karmaprakriti, Shatak and Saptaatika were compiled, and based on the third Prabhrut of the tenth object of the Gyanapravad Purva, the Kashayaprabhrut was compiled.

Of these texts, the Karmaprati text is considered to be in the Svetambara tradition, and the Vashayaabhrut and Shatkhandagam are considered to be in the Digambara tradition. The Shatak and Saptaatika are considered to be in both traditions, with some variations in the text.

The practice of naming a text based on the number of verses or shlokas has been prevalent since ancient times. For example, Acharya Shivsharm's 'Shatak', Acharya Siddhasen's Dvatrishika Prakaran, Acharya Haribhadrasuri's Panchashak Prakaran, Vishati-Vishatika Prakaran, Shodashak Prakaran, Ashtak Prakaran, Acharya Jinchalabh's Padhashiti Prakaran, etc. can be cited as examples. The name Saptaatika seems to have been given based on this principle. It is also called the sixth Karma text because it comes sixth in the current count of Karma texts.

Saptaatika is one of the five texts considered to be the original literature on Karma. Saptaatika refers to differences of opinion in many places. For example, one difference of opinion is in verses 16-20 and its commentary, when mentioning the number of Udayavikalpa and Padavrindas, and another difference of opinion is in the Aayogikevali Gunasthan, when mentioning the name karma. 

Page #16:
---------------------------
The text discusses the origin and number of verses in the "Sapttatika," a Jain text. It suggests that the text was likely composed during a time when various Jain doctrines were prevalent. While the first verse describes it as a "drop" of the "Dristibad Anga," commentators attribute its origin to the fourth "Prabhat" of the fifth "Vastu" of the "Agraniyya Purva." This suggests its inclusion in the original literature. 

The text further argues that the "Sapttatika" encapsulates the essence of the "Karma Siddhanta" (theory of karma), making it a fundamental text. However, there is disagreement regarding the number of verses in the "Sapttatika." This particular edition contains 72 verses, but other editions have varying counts. 

The name "Sapttatika" (meaning "seven-seven") is derived from the number of verses, but the final verses seem to indicate the conclusion of the main topic, suggesting that they might not be included in the original count. 

Different editions have different numbers of verses: 61 in the edition published by Shri Jan Shreyaskar Mandal, 64 in the edition published in the fourth part of "Prakarana Ratnakar," and 72 in the edition published by Shri Atmanand Jain Granthamala with Acharya Malayagiri's commentary. An edition with "Chuni" (commentary) lists 71 verses.

The variation in verse count is attributed to Gujarati commentators incorporating inter-textual verses into the original text and including verses deemed useful for the topic. 

Page #17:
---------------------------
(20)
The *Sapta-tika* with its commentary is considered to be a part of the *Sri Atmanand Jain Granthamala*. The last two verses are added after the subject matter is described, so if they are not counted, the name *Sapta-tika* becomes meaningful. The detailed introduction of the author, Acharya Shrimad Devendrasuri, the creator of the five new *Karmagranthas* and their self-composed commentaries, has already been given in the preface of the *Prashram Karmagrantha*. Therefore, we will only consider the author of the *Sapta-tika*.

There are no available resources to answer questions like who was the author of the *Sapta-tika*, who were his parents, who were his *Deekshaguru* and *Vidya-guru*, who did he purify by his presence, etc. The *Sapta-tika* and its commentaries available today do not help in providing information about the author's name, etc.

In the ancient palm leaf manuscript of the original *Sapta-tika* chapter, the following verse is found, which is attributed to Chandri Mahत्तर:

"Gahma sayariye Chandamahत्तरmayaanusariye. Tigei niyamianam eguṇa hoi naui u."

However, this verse does not testify that Chandrashi Mahत्तर was the author of the *Sapta-tika*. This verse only reveals that the verses of the *Sapta-tika* (instead of 70, they have increased to) 89, based on the commentary that follows the opinion of Chandrashi Mahत्तर. This verse only mentions the reason for the increase in the number of verses in the *Sapta-tika*, but it does not say anything about the author. Acharya Malayagiri has also not indicated anything about this in the beginning and end of his commentary. Thus, nothing can be said with certainty about the author of the *Sapta-tika*. 

Page #18:
---------------------------
Chandrarsi Mahttar Acharya composed the Panchasangrah, which contains the Shataka, Saptattika, Kashaya-Prabhrit, Satkarma, and Karma-Prakriti. These five texts predate Chandrarsi Mahttar Acharya, making them ancient works. If, as is commonly believed, the Saptattikakar and Panchasangrahakar were the same Acharya, then the works of commentators and authors of chuni (commentaries) would have mentioned the Panchasangrah as they do the Shataka, Saptattika, and Karma-Prakriti. However, there is no such mention. Therefore, it can be concluded that the author of the Saptattika is a different, unknown Acharya, who is even more ancient than the Panchasangrahakar.

This conclusion is further supported by the similarity between the last two verses (104-105) of the Shataka and the concluding verse (72) of the Saptattika. This suggests that the compilers of both texts may be the same Acharya. The verses from the Saptattika and Shataka are as follows:

1) Vochchh Sun Sankhevam Nosandan Didvidhayass.
2) Kammappavay Suyasagarass Nisandamettaao.
3) Jo Jaththa Apidipugno Aththo Appagamen Bandho Ti.
4) Tam Khamiun Bahusuyya Pureun Parikahantu.
5) Bandhavihan Samaso Raio Appa Suyamandamdainau.
6) Te Bandh Mokvaniuna Pureun Parikahenti.

As seen in the above excerpts, the introductory verse of the Saptattika mentions the same subject matter as the concluding verse of the Shataka. 

Page #19:
---------------------------
Just as the *drishtivad* is described as a drop of water in an anga, similarly in the 104th gatha of the Shataka, it is described as a single *re* of the *karmapranad* *alaroopi*. Just as in the final gatha of the Saptaatika, the author, while expressing his own insignificance, indicates that whatever I, the one with little knowledge, have written as an error, let the one with much knowledge complete and state it. Similarly, in the 105th gatha of the Shataka, it is also directed that whatever I, the one with little knowledge, have said about the essence of *bandhavidhan*, let the one skilled in the method of *bandhamoksha* complete and state it.

In addition to this, in the above gathas, the words *hissand*, *appagama*, *appasuyamandam*, *pureunam*, *parikahantu* are also worth noting.

This similarity in both these texts is not accidental. Such similarity is seen or can be seen only in those texts which are authored by one person or are written based on each other. From this, it is inferred that it is very likely that the Shataka and the Saptaatika are the works of the same Acharya. In the *chuni* of the Shataka, Acharya Shivsharm is mentioned as its author. This could be the same Acharya Shivsharm who is considered to be the author of *Karmaprakriti*. Considering this, it is proven that *Karmaprakriti*, *Shataka*, and *Saptaatika* are all the works of the same author.

But when *Karmaprakriti* and *Saptaatika* are compared, it is not proven that both were written by the same Acharya. Because in both these texts, two opposing views are presented. For example, in the *Saptaatika*, the *anantaanubandhi chatushka* is described as *upshama prakriti*, but in the *upshaman* section of *Karmaprakriti*, the *upshama vidhi* and *antarakarna vidhi* of the *anantaanubandhi chatushka* are prohibited. Therefore, it seems impossible to be certain about the author of the *Saptaatika*. 

Page #20:
---------------------------
It is also possible that the compiler of these texts is the same Acharya and that they were compiled on two different bases. Whatever the case may be, it cannot be definitively said that the author of the Saptaatika is Acharya Shivsharm. Thus, it is difficult to say for sure who the author of the Saptaatika is, whether it is Acharya Shivsharm, Acharya Chandrashi Mahत्तर, or some other great soul. However, it can be said that whoever the author may be, it is important and for this reason many later Acharyas have attempted to clarify the heart of the text by writing commentaries, sub-commentaries, churni, tika, vritti, etc. on it. The reference to the dohas etc. of the Saptaatika is being made further. Time of Composition
The author and the time of composition are both dependent on each other. Once one is decided, it becomes easier to decide the other. Earlier, while referring to the author, the possibility was definitely expressed that either Acharya Shivsharm Suri composed it or it was written before him. Generally, the time of Acharya Shivsharm Suri is considered to be the fifth century Vikram. Considering this, the time of its composition is proved to be the fifth century Vikram or earlier. Shri Jinbhadraganikshamaashraman has mentioned the Saptaatika in his Vishishtavati at many places and the time of Shri Jinbhadraganikshamaashraman is definitely the seventh century Vikram. Therefore, even if the aforementioned time is considered to be only an estimate, it is certain that the Saptaatika was composed before the seventh century.
Apart from this, it is not possible to say anything definitively about the time of composition. It can only be said that the Sapta.

(24) The composition of the Sapta-tika took place before the 7th century and there should be no doubt in accepting this. Let us examine the Sapta-tika.

It has been indicated earlier that the Sapta-tika is considered one of the most important texts in the Karma literature because it concisely explains the various aspects of the Karma theory. Due to this, many later Acharyas have attempted to clarify its inner meaning by writing commentaries, tikas, churni, etc. on it. So far, the following tikas, commentaries, churni, etc. of the Sapta-tika have been found:

| Name | Author | Composition Period | Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| Antarbhashya Gatha Gatha 10 | Unknown | Unknown | Bhashya |
| Gatha 191 | Abhaydeva Suri | 12-13th Century | Dhuni |
| Patra 132 | Unknown | Unknown | Churni |
| Pra-loka 2300 | Chandrashi Mahattar | 7th Century | Churni |
| Shloka 3780 | Malayagiri Suri | 12-13th Century | Bhashya-Vritti |
| Shloka 4150 | Merutunga Suri | 1446 | Tippani |
| Shloka 57 | Ramdeva Gani | 12th Century | Avchuri |
|  | Gunaratna Suri | 15th Century |  |

Out of these, the Churni of Chandrashi Mahattar and the Vritti of Acharya Malayagiri have been published. In this Hindi commentary, the Vritti of Acharya Malayagiri Suri has been used.

The commentator Acharya Malayagiri, like the author of the Sapta-tika, is also not known. His birthplace, parents, gachchha, initiation guru, knowledge guru, etc. are unknown. Where were his centers of learning, writing, and wandering? His...

---------------------------
(25) It cannot be said for certain whether there was a disciple-family or not. However, based on the mention in the Kumarapala Prabandha, it can be inferred that he was a contemporary of Acharya Hemchandra and Maharaj Kumarapala.
Acharya Malayagiri enriched the treasury of literature by writing commentaries on numerous texts. The commentary published by Shri Jan Atmanand Granthamala, Bhavnagar, provides information about approximately 25 commentary texts authored by Acharya Malayagiri. Of these, 17 texts have been printed and six are unavailable.
Looking at these commentaries, it becomes clear that he presented each subject with great success and wherever he hints at a new topic, he provides evidence to support it. Therefore, it can be said that Acharya Malayagiri Suri occupies the same position in Jain literature as Nirati does in Vedic literature.
Other Saptatikas
Apart from the present Saptatika, one Saptatika is included in the Panchasangraha by Acharya Chandrarsi Mahttar. Panchasangraha is a collection of texts and is divided into five parts. The name of its final chapter is Saptatika.
Most of the verses of the Saptatika in Panchasangraha resemble the present Saptatika, and the composition of Panchasangraha took place much later than the present Saptatika. Despite being named Saptatika, it contains 156 verses. This indicates that the Saptatika in Panchasangraha is based on this Saptatika.
Another Saptatika is also prevalent in the Digambara tradition, which is found as a part of the Prakrit Panchasangraha. Prakrit Panchasangraha 

Page #23:
---------------------------
(26)
This is a collection of texts. The final chapter is the Saptaatika. Acharya Amitagati composed the Sanskrit Panchasangraha based on this. It is a combination of prose and poetry and contains over 1300 verses.
In addition, two chapters, Shataka and Saptaatika, are similar to the Shataka and Saptaatika prevalent in the Svetambara tradition, with some variations in the text. The present Saptaatika has 72 verses and the Digambara tradition's Saptaatika has 79 verses. About 40 verses are almost identical, 14-15 verses have some variations in the text, and the remaining verses are different. The reason for this could be differences in beliefs and style. However, these differences in beliefs are not based on sectarian differences. Similarly, differences in the style of narration have led to differences in the verses. This difference is seen in the Upshamana and Kshapana chapters.
Thus, although there is a difference between these two Saptaatikas, they both originate from the same source and, after being divided into two streams in between, finally become one.
The essential points about the Saptaatika have been highlighted, so there is no need to say more.
Thus, I have expressed my views on Karma Siddhanta and Karma Granthas in the form of prefaces. I humbly request the learned community to kindly pay special attention to the promotion, study, and teaching of Karma literature.

Karmagrantha
[Sapttatika Prakarana: Bhaga Chatha] 

Page #39:
---------------------------
The Saptaatika chapter is unhindered. Scholars should study, contemplate and reflect on such texts without any worry. Therefore, Acharya Malayagiri has given the following two meanings of the 'Siddhpaeihi' Siddhapad in the form of a verse:

Those texts whose all verses follow the meaning of the omniscient, which are established, whose inherent meaning depth cannot be distorted in any way, or doubt does not arise, those texts are called Siddhapad. Or, in the Jinaagama, the terms Jeevasthan, Gunasyan, and Rupa are famous, therefore, the verse 'Siddhapad' is given to make known the Jeevasthans and Gunasthans.

According to the first meaning, the word 'Siddhagad' is a hindrance to Karma-prakriti and other Prabhuta, because the subject of this Saptaatika chapter is based on those texts, which the author has compiled in a concise manner. To clarify this, the fourth verse of the verse indicates 'Neesandan Dittivaayass' which is like a drop of the great ocean of Dristivaad. The reason for mentioning it as a drop of the great ocean of Dristivaad is that the Dristivaad, which is the twelfth Anga, has five divisions: Parikrama, Sutra, Prathamanuyog, Purvagat, and Chulika. Of these, Purvagat has fourteen divisions, including Utpada-purva. The second Purva is called Agrayaaniy, and it has fourteen main Adhikars, which are called Vastu...

1. Siddha - established, impossible to move, that is the meaning. Therefore, those texts in which the verses are Siddha, they are Siddhapad.
- Saptaatika Prakaran Tika, page 136

2. Swasamaya Siddhani - famous, which are Jeevasthan-Gunasyan-rupa, those are Siddhapad. Those are the subject matter, relying on them, that is the meaning.

Salutations to the Supreme Being, the Lord of Purity.

**Chapter on the Sapta-tika**
[Sixth Karma Grantha] An anticipation of the basis, subject matter, and profound meaning of the Chapter on the Sapta-tika.

**Verse 1:**
From the authoritative texts, the Siddha-paeya, I will explain in brief the locations of the states of bondage, liberation, and existence. Listen attentively, this is a concise explanation, a drop from the vast ocean of the doctrine of vision.

**Word Meaning:**
Siddha-paeya - texts containing the words of the Siddhas, Mahattham - great meaning, Bandhodaya-satta-paditthana - locations of the states of bondage, liberation, and existence, Vochcham - I will say, Sun - listen, Sankhevam - in brief, Nisanda - a drop, a point, Dihi-vayassa - the doctrine of vision.

**Meaning:**
Based on the authoritative texts containing the words of the Siddhas, I will briefly explain the locations of the states of bondage, liberation, and existence. Listen attentively. This concise explanation is like a drop from the vast ocean of the doctrine of vision, containing great meaning.

**Special Note:**
The verse indicates the authenticity of the text, the subject matter, etc. First, to convey the authenticity of the text, the verse states "Siddha-paeya," meaning this text is based on the words of the Siddhas. There is no contradiction in the subject matter described in this text. Any text, scripture, or chapter that is based on the words of the omniscient is considered authoritative by scholars. 

Page #41:
---------------------------
Sixth Karma Granth:

It is said that there are twenty sub-authorities of the fifth object, which are called Prama, and the fourth Prabhut among these is called Karma-prakriti. This Karma-prakriti is the basis of this Sapta-tika chapter.

From the above statement, it is clear that this chapter is authentic because it follows the meaning spoken by Sarvjnadev. Because Sarvjnadev teaches the meaning, then after understanding it, the Ganadharas bind it in twelve Angas. Other Thacharyas create other compositions by reading those twelve Angas directly or by knowing them through tradition. This chapter is also composed based on the words of Sarvjnadev, which were bound by the Ganadharas. The second meaning of 'Sidhpad' is Gunasthan, Jeevasthan. The implication is that without taking them as the basis, the bondage, rise and existence of Karma-prakritis cannot be described. Therefore, to make them aware of them and the bondage, rise, existence places and their sensory disruptions in them, the meaning of 'Shinkpad' is also considered to be Jothasthan and Gunasthan.

From the above discussion, although we know that this chapter called Sapta-tika summarizes the subject of Karma-prakriti Prabhat etc., it does not mean that it does not have depth of meaning. Although there are many such Akhyan, Alapka and Sangrahani etc. texts which are concise but devoid of the weight of meaning, but this text is not among them. That is, the text has been made concise, but this concise form is full of depth of meaning. There has been no reduction in the special features. To make this known, the author has given the epithet 'Mahathe Maharth' in the verse.

After telling the features of the text, the author has described the subject... 

Page #42:
---------------------------
## The Chapter on the Sevenfold Classification

The text states, "The binding, arising, and existence of the nature-places are being explained." Their characteristics are as follows:

"The mutual relationship between karma-atoms and the soul-regions, like fire entering every particle of a piece of wood, is called binding."

"The experience of karma-atoms that have attained the ripening stage is called arising."

"From the time of blindness or transition until the karma-atoms transition to another nature-form or until their exhaustion, their abiding with the soul is called existence."

The word "place" is collective, therefore, the term "nature-place" should be understood as a collection of two, three, or more natures.

These nature-places are of three types, based on the distinctions of binding, arising, and existence, which are being discussed in this text.

The verb "listen" in the verse indicates that the author is addressing and cautioning the disciples to listen attentively to the explanation of the scriptures. Because without caution, study is futile. 

Page #43:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karma Granth: Verse 2

**Situation:** When a student is unable to benefit from the teachings and the Acharya feels distressed. To prevent this situation and ensure the student understands the Acharya's teachings properly, the word "Suṇ" (listen) is used in the verse.

**Introduction:** After explaining the subject matter of the Granth, we now begin the text. The subject matter of the Granth is to briefly explain the Bandha, Udaya, and Satva Prakriti Sthanas (states of nature). Therefore, the student asks the Acharya a question to satisfy their curiosity:

**Verse:**

"Kai bandhato veyah kah kar vaa bhangavigappa muluttarpagai
Payadittaanaani. Bodhava." || 2 ||

**Word Meaning:**

* Kai: How many
* Bandhato: Bind
* Veyah: Experience
* Kah kar: How many
* Vaa: Or
* Paryatithaanaani: States of nature
* Salusaraai: Original and subsequent natures
* Bhangavigappa: Variations
* U: And
* Bodhava: Should know

**Verse Meaning:**

How many natures bind the living being, and how many natures does it experience? How many natures bind and experience, and how many natures are its Satva (state of being)? Therefore, one should know the many variations in the original and subsequent natures.

**Special Meaning:**

The subject matter of the Granth is to explain the Bandha (binding), Udaya (arising), and Satva (state of being) Prakriti Sthanas (states of nature). Therefore, the student raises a question about how many natures are bound, how many arise during binding, etc. The Acharya answers the student's question by saying that one should know the many variations in the original and subsequent natures. This means that there are many variations in the original and subsequent natures of Karma (actions). 

Page #44:
---------------------------
## The Chapter of the Seven Tika

Alternatives arise, but due to the limitations of verbal capacity, it is not possible to fully describe them. Therefore, in the original and subsequent natures, these alternatives are generally described in a general way.

Thus, considering the meaning of this verse, two things are revealed. Firstly, this chapter primarily discusses the bondage-nature locations, arising-nature locations, and being-nature locations of the original natures and subsequently the subsequent natures, along with their mutual interaction and the resulting disruptions. Secondly, these disruptions and alternatives are described as occurring in the respective living beings and qualities.

Keeping this subject division in mind, the commentary first describes the bondage-nature locations, arising-nature locations, and being-nature locations of the original natures. Without describing these, the interaction of these locations mentioned in the subsequent verses cannot be easily understood. Additionally, the owners and time of these locations are mentioned as per the context, which is being explained below.

**Bondage Location, Owner, and Their Time:**

There are eight categories of the original natures of karma: 1. Knowledge-obscuring, 2. Perception-obscuring, 3. Painful, 4. Deluding, 5. Life-span, 6. Name, 7. Lineage, and 8. Obstruction. Their nature and characteristics have been explained. The original karma natures are of eight, seven, six...

1. **"They interact with each other, and their mutual opposition causes destruction."** 
(Karma-prakriti Bandhodaya, p. 65) 

Page #45:
---------------------------
**Sixth Karma Granth: Ma 02**

There are a total of four Bandha sthana (bond places) - eight, seven, six, and one. These are based on the number of Prakruti (nature) involved.

* **Eight Prakruti Bandha sthana:**  All eight Prakruti are bound.
* **Seven Prakruti Bandha sthana:**  Seven Prakruti are bound, excluding Ayukarma (life-span karma).
* **Six Prakruti Bandha sthana:**  Six Prakruti are bound, excluding Ayukarma and Mohaniya karma (delusion karma).
* **One Prakruti Bandha sthana:**  Only Vedaniya karma (pain karma) is bound.

This means that a being who binds Ayukarma will have all eight karmas bound. A being who binds Mohaniya karma will have all eight karmas bound, or seven without Ayukarma. A being who binds Jnanavaran (knowledge obscuring karma), Darshanavaran (perception obscuring karma), Nam (name karma), Gotra (lineage karma), and Antaraya karma (hindrance karma) will have all eight, seven, or six karmas bound. A being who binds only Vedaniya karma will have all eight, seven, six, or one karma bound.

Now, we will discuss the beings who bind these Prakruti.

Ayukarma is bound up to the seventh Apramatta Samyata Gunasthana (state of non-distracted equanimity). However, since there is a rule that Ayukarma is not bound in the Misra Gunasthana (mixed state), beings who have the remaining six Gunasthana without the Misra Gunasthana are the owners of the eight Prakruti Bandha sthana.

Mohaniya karma is bound up to the ninth Gunasthana. Therefore, beings from the first to the ninth Gunasthana are the owners of the seven Prakruti Bandha sthana. However, those who also bind Ayukarma are not the owners of the seven Prakruti Bandha sthana.

## The Excellent Duration of the Seven Natural Bonds:

The excellent duration of the seven natural bonds is **one-third of a ** *tribhaga* ** more than thirty-three *sagaras***, which is less than one *purva koti* year by an *antarmuhurt*. This is because when a human or a *tithancha* with a lifespan of one *purva koti* years has one division of their lifespan remaining, they experience a bond related to the *parbhava* until the *antarmuhurt* time. After the lifespan is exhausted, the being is reborn in the *dambas* or *narakas* with an excellent lifespan of thirty-three *sagaras*. When six months of their lifespan remain, they again experience a bond related to the *parbhava*. This is when they attain the excellent duration of their seven natural bonds.

## The Inferior and Excellent Duration of the Six Natural Bonds:

The inferior duration of the six natural bonds is **one *samaya***, and the excellent duration is **one *antarmuhurt***. This is because the six natural bonds belong to the *sukshmasampradha* *gunasthanavi* beings. Therefore, the *upshamaka* being with the aforementioned *gunasthan* who resides in the *sukshmasampradha* *gunasthan* for one *samaya* while ascending or descending the *upshama* *shreni* and dies to become a *samyagdristi* deva in the next *samaya*, has an inferior duration of one *samaya* for their six natural bonds. The excellent duration of the six natural bonds is considered to be one *antarmuhurt* because the excellent duration of the *sukshmasampradha* *gunasthan* is one *antarmuhurt*.

## The Inferior and Excellent Duration of the One Natural Bond:

The inferior duration of the one natural bond is **one *samaya***, and the excellent duration is **slightly less than one *purva koti* years**. This is because the being with the *upshama* *shreni* who resides in the *upshantamoha* *gunasthan* for one *samaya* and dies to become a deva in the next *samaya*, has an inferior duration of one *samaya* for their one natural bond. The human with a lifespan of one *purva koti* years who spends seven months in the womb and is born after eight years,

## Sapttatika Prakarana, Chapter 10

After the passage of time, by adopting restraint, one who becomes a Sayogikevali within an Antarmuhurta, his one natural Bandha-sthana's excellent time is obtained as eight years, seven months, and one Antarmuhurta less than one Purva-koti years. The details of the Bandha-sthana's types, their owners, and their time are as follows:

| Bandha-sthana | Bhava-prakritik |  Sapt-prakritik |  Chanch-prakritik |  Ek-prakritik |  Mool-prakritik |  Owner |  Time |

## Sapttatika Prakarana, Chapter 11

After stating the Bandha-prakritik-sthana, now we describe the Prakritik-sthana from the perspective of Udaya. There are three Udaya-sthana for the eight, seven, and four Prakritik, and similarly for the Mool-prakritik.

1.  **Udayam prati trini prakritik-sthanaani tadyatha ashtau sapt chatasrah.**

---------------------------
**Text from Karb Granth: Verse 2**

In the eight natural stages of arising, all eight karmas arise. In the seven natural stages of arising, seven karmas arise without the mohaniya karma. In the four natural stages of arising, four aghati karmas arise. From this, it can be concluded that the arising of all eight karmas occurs when mohaniya is present. When mohaniya is absent, the remaining three ghati karmas arise, resulting in the arising of eight or seven karmas. The arising of eight karmas occurs up to the tenth gunasthan, called sukshmasampray. The arising of seven karmas occurs in the upashantmoha or kshinamoha gunasthan. The arising of four aghati karmas occurs when eight, seven, or four karmas arise. Of these, eight arise up to the sukshmasampray gunasthan, seven arise in the upashantmoha or kshinamoha gunasthan, and four arise in the sayogikevali and ayogikevali gunasthan.

The lords of the aforementioned stages of arising should be understood as follows: The mohaniya karma arises up to the tenth sukshmasampray gunasthan. Therefore, the lords of the eight natural stages of arising are the jivas from the beginning up to the tenth gunasthan. Except for mohaniya, the remaining three ghati karmas arise up to the twelfth gunasthan. Therefore, the lords of the seven natural stages of arising are:

---------------------------
## The Sapttatika Chapter

**Swami** are the beings of the eleventh and twelfth **guna-sthana**. The four **aghati** karmas arise until the thirteenth **sayogikevali** and fourteenth **ayogikevali** guna-sthana. Therefore, the **sayogikevali** and **ayogikevali** beings are the **swami** of the four **prakritik** **udaya-sthana**.

There are three options for the time of the eight **prakritik** **udaya-sthana** in these three **udaya-sthana**: 1. **Anadi-ananta**, 2. **Anadi-santa**, and 3. **Sadi-santa**. Of these, **abhavya** have **anadi-ananta**, **bhavya** have **anadi-santa**, and beings who have fallen from the **upshamsamoha** guna-sthana have **sadi-santa** time.

Compared to the **sadi-santa** option, the **jghanya** time of the eight **prakritik** **udaya-sthana** is **antarmuhurta**, and the **utkrista** time is slightly less than **apardha-pudgala-paravarta** pramana. The being who falls from **upshamni** and again becomes **upshamsamohi** in the **antarmuhurta** time of **ga-upshamsa** has **antarmuhurta** as the **jghanya** time of the eight **prakritik** **udaya-sthana**. And the being who is **upshamsamohi** at the beginning and **kshinamohi** at the end of the **apardha-pudgala-paravarta** time has **apardha-pudgala-paravarta** as the **utkrista** time of the eight **prakritik** **udaya-sthana**.

The **upapaanta-kshaya** and **kshinakshaya** have the seven **udaya** without **mohaniya** in these two guna-sthana, and the four **aghati** karmas arise in both **sayogi** and **ayogi** according to the rule.

---------------------------
## Chapter 13, Sixth Karma Granth, Verse 2

The **utkṛṣṭakāla** (peak time) of the **udayastāna** (arising place) of the **saṁskāra** (karmic matter) is slightly less than half a **pṛthvī** (earth).

**1.** The **jayakāla** (conquering time) of the seven **mṛtikā** (earth) **sthāna** (places) is one **samaya** (moment) and the **utkṛṣṭakāla** is **antarmuhūrta** (half a moment). The arising of the seven **mūla prakṛti** (fundamental substances) occurs in the **upaśānta moha** (subdued delusion) and **kṣīṇa moha** (diminished delusion) **guṇasthāna** (quality places). However, in the **kṣīṇa moha** **guṇasthāna**, there is neither death nor **patan** (fall) from it. And a **jīva** (soul) residing in the **kṣīṇa moha** **guṇasthāna**, by the rule, destroys the three **ghāti karma** (destructive karmas) and becomes a **sayogikevalī** (liberated soul with subtle karmas). But in the **upaśānta moha** **guṇasthāna**, the **jīva** experiences both death and **pratipāt** (fall). Therefore, a **jīva** who resides in the **upaśānta moha** **guṇasthāna** for one **samaya** and then dies, becoming a **samyagdṛṣṭi deva** (perfectly enlightened god) without interruption, is considered to have a **jighanya kāla** (minimum time) of one **samaya** for the arising place of the seven **prakṛti**. And the **utkṛṣṭakāla** of the **upaśānta moha** or **kṣīṇa moha** **guṇasthāna** is **antarmuhūrta**. Therefore, the **utkṛṣṭakāla** of the arising place of the seven **prakṛti** is considered to be **antarmuhūrta**.

The **jighanya kāla** of the arising place of the four **prakṛti** is **antarmuhūrta** and the **utkṛṣṭakāla** is slightly less than one **pūrva koṭi** (previous aeon). A **jīva** who becomes a **sayogikevalī** and attains **nirvāṇa** within an **antarmuhūrta** is considered to have a **jighanya kāla** of **antarmuhūrta** for the arising place of the four **prakṛti**. And the **utkṛṣṭakāla** should be understood as being similar to the **desa** (region) of one **pūrva koṭi** **pramaṇa** (measure) of the **bandhasthāna** (binding place) of one **prakṛti**. That is, just as it is stated that the **utkṛṣṭakāla** of the **bandhasthāna** of one **prakṛti** is the age of a human being who lives for one **pūrva koṭi** years, stays in the womb for seven months, and then...

## The Saptaatika Chapter

When a person attains restraint after eight years from birth, and within a single antarmukhurta becomes kshina moha, sayog kevali, then that should be considered as one purva koti year minus eight years and seven months. Here, the special feature is that the kshina moha gunasthan has the antarmukhurta navae.

The details of the udhayasthanas, their masters, and time are as follows:

**Time** | **Udhayasthan** | **Master** | **Nature**
------- | -------- | -------- | --------
| All |  Ten gunasthanas of adi |  |  Eight nature
|  |  Seven gunasthanas without moha |  |  Seven nature
|  |  11th, 12th gunasthan |  |  Four nature
|  |  13th gunasthan |  |  Four nature, four aghati
|  |  14th gunasthan |  |  Four nature, four aghati
|  |  14th gunasthan |  |  Four nature, four aghati
|  |  I |  |  Aghatya, utkrisht antarmukhurta, slightly less aparth
|  |  One time |  |  Pudgal paravarta antarmukhurta
|  |  Antarmukhurta |  |  Deshon purva koti

**Sattastana, Master, and Time**

After explaining the bandha and udhayasthanas, now we explain the sattastanas. There are three types of sattastanas: eight nature, seven nature, and four nature. In the eight nature sattastan, all eight karmas, from jnanaavaran to antaray, are accepted. In the seven nature sattastan, all seven karmas except mohaniya are accepted. In the four nature sattastan, only the four aghati karmas are accepted.

The specific explanation is that in the presence of mohaniya karma, all eight karmas exist. In the presence of jnanaavaran, darshanavaran, and antakaya, all eight karmas exist.

**1. Satta prati shrinni prakriti sthanaani. Tadyatha - Ashtau, sapta, chatasrah. - Saptaatika Prakaran Teeka, p. 143**

---------------------------
## From the Karma Granth: Chapter 2

**Regarding the seven karmas without the mohaniya karma, and the four aghati karmas (vedaniya, ayu, nama, and gotra), the existence of all eight, or the seven without the mohaniya, or the four aghati karmas is found.**

**The owners of these places of existence are as follows:**

The four aghati karmas exist for both the sayogika and ayogika kevalis. Therefore, the owners of the four natural places of existence are the sayogika kevali and ayogika kevali gunasthanavarti. The existence of the remaining seven karmas without the mohaniya is found in the 12th kshinamoha gunasthan. Therefore, the owners of the seven natural places of existence are the jivas who are in the kshinamoha gunasthan. The existence of all eight karmas is found from the first to the 11th upshantamoha gunasthan. Therefore, the owners of the eight natural places of existence are the jivas who are in the first to the 11th gunasthan.

1. **The existence of the mohaniya karma is also found in the existence of the jnana, aparanadarshana, and avarana antarayas. The existence of all eight or seven is found in the existence of the vedaniya, ayu, nama, and gotra.** - Sapttatika Prakaran Tika, page 143
2. **The existence of the four (aghati karmas) is the existence of the vedaniya, etc. This is to be seen in the sayogika kevali gunasthan and the ayogika kevali gunasthan.** - Sapttatika Prakaran Tika, page 143
3. **(Or) The existence of the seven (karmas) without the mohaniya is found up to the upshantamoha gunasthan, and the existence of the four (aghati karmas) is found in the kshinamoha gunasthan.** - Sapttatika Prakaran Tika, page 143
4. **(Or) The existence of the eight (karmas) is found in the existence of the four (aghati karmas) in the sayogika and ayogika kevalis.** - Go. Karmakand, Chapter 457

**The existence of all eight karmas is found up to the upshantakashay gunasthan. In the kshinakashay gunasthan, only the existence of the seven karmas without the mohaniya is found. And the existence of the four aghati karmas is found in both the sayogika kevali and ayogika kevali.** 

Page #54:
---------------------------
## Chapter Seventy-Three

**Of the eight natural states of existence, the time period is beginningless and endless in relation to the Abhyavi, because the Abhyavi only has the Mithyatva Gunasthan, and in the Mithyatva Gunasthan, there is no decay of any original nature. In relation to the Bhavya, the time period of the eight natural states of existence is beginningless and finite, because the Kshapaka, in the Sukhsma Samparaya Gunasthan, completely destroys the Mohaniya Karma, and after that, in the Kshina Moh Gunasthan, the seven natural states of existence are attained, and it does not happen from the Kshina Moh Gunasthan. From this, it is proven that the eight natural states of existence are beginningless and finite in relation to the Bhavya.**

**The seven natural states of existence are in the twelfth Kshina Moh Gunasthan, and the time period of the Kshina Moh Gunasthan, from the least to the greatest, is the measure of an Antarmuhurt. Therefore, the time period of the seven natural states of existence, from the least to the greatest, is also the measure of an Antarmuhurt.**

**The four natural states of existence are found in the Sayogikevali and Ayogikevali Gunasthanas, and the least time period of these Gunasthanas is an Antarmuhurt, and the greatest time period is slightly less than one Purva Koti years. Therefore, the least time period of the four natural states of existence should be understood as an Antarmuhurt, and the greatest time period as slightly less than one Purva Koti years.**

**1. In that, all the natural states of existence are eight, and the existence of these eight, in relation to the Abhyavi, is beginningless and endless, and in relation to the Bhavya, it is beginningless and finite.**

**2. The existence of the seven natural states of existence, which are destroyed by the Mohaniya Karma, and their time period, from the least to the greatest, is the measure of an Antarmuhurt, because it is in the Kshina Moh, and the Kshina Moh Gunasthan is also the measure of an Antarmuhurt.** 

Page #55:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karma Granth: Verse 3

Here, "some less" means eight years, seven months, and the Antarmūhūrta measure. The description of the owners of the Satta-sthānas, time, etc., is as follows:

**Satta-sthāna |  Mūla-prakriti | Owner | Time | Offspring | Excellent | Eight Prakṛitis | All | Beginning | Eleven | Anadi-sānta | Anadi-ananta**
**Guṇa-sthāna | Seven Prakṛitis | Mohiṇīya | Kṣīṇa-moha | Antarmūhūrta | Antarmūhūrta**
**| Without Guṇa-sthāna | Four Prakṛitis | Four | Aghati | 13th, 14th | Antarmūhūrta / Deśona Pūrva-koṭi**

Guṇa-sthāna: In this way, one should understand the separate bondage, arising, and Satta-prakriti-sthānas of the Mūla-prakritis. Now, in the next verse, we will discuss the various types of breaking of the Mūla-karmas.

**Breaking of the Mūla-karmas**

**Aṭṭhavihasattacchbandageśu aṭṭheva uvamasantāi.**
**Egavihe tivigappō egavigappō abandhammī. ||3||**

1. In the case of the four types of Ghātika-karma, there are four Satta-sthānas, and they are the lowest, with the Antarmūhūrta measure. The highest is measured by the Deśona Pūrva-koṭi. - Sapta-tika Prakaraṇa Ṭīkā, 143
2. Compare:
**Aḍhavihasattacchbandageśu aṭṭheva udayakammaṁsā.**
**Eyavihe vidhiyappō epp viyappō abandhammī. || - Go. Karmakāṇḍa, 628**

- In the Mūla-prakritis, there are eight types of arising and Satta-sthānas for those beings who have bondage of the type of Shānāvaraṇa, etc., or those who have seven types of bondage, or those who have six types of bondage. For those who have bondage of only one type of Mūla-prakriti, there are three types. For those who have no bondage of any Mūla-prakriti, there are four types of arising and Satta-sthānas, making only one option.

## The Chapter of Sevenfold

**Word Meanings:**

* **Avisattadhanbandho:**  At the time of eightfold, sevenfold, and sixfold bondage.
* **Atheva:** All eight karmas.
* **Udayasansai:**  Uday (arising) and Satta (existence).
* **Egabihe:**  Onefold bondage.
* **Tivi-gapppo:** Three options.
* **Egavi-gapppo:** One option.
* **Mbandhammi:** In the state of non-bondage.
* **Bandha ne hone par:** When bondage occurs.

**Verse Meaning:**

At the time of eightfold, sevenfold, and sixfold bondage of karmas, there is uday and satta of all eight karmas. In the case of onefold bondage, there are three options for uday and satta, while in the state of non-bondage, there is only one option for uday and satta.

**Detailed Meaning:**

This verse discusses the relationship between the bondage, uday, and satta of the fundamental natures. When there is eightfold, sevenfold, or sixfold bondage, there is uday and satta of all eight karmas - "Achetara Udayasansai". This means that until the seventh "Aparamatta-samyata" Gunasthan, all beings can bind all eight karmas at the time of Ayubandha. Therefore, they have eightfold bondage, eightfold uday, and eightfold satta.

Beings up to the "Anivriti-vadara-samparaya" Gunasthan bind all seven karmas except Ayukarma, but their uday and satta can be of all eight karmas. Similarly, beings in the "Sukshma-samparaya-samyata" Gunasthan bind only six karmas, excluding Ayukarma and Mohaniya karma, but their uday and satta can still be of all eight karmas.

The reason why uday and satta are considered the same despite differences in the nature of karma bondage is that all these beings are "Saraga" (attached). The cause of "Saragata" is the uday of Mohaniya karma. When Mohaniya karma arises, its satta is inevitable. 

Page #57:
---------------------------
Rajat Karmagranth; Chapter 3

It will be. Therefore, when there is a binding of eight, seven, and six types of karmas, there is an arising and existence of all eight karmas.
From this statement, the following three interpretations are obtained: 1. Eight types of karmas are present in the state of existence, eight types of karmas are present in the state of arising, and eight types of karmas are present in the state of binding. 2. Seven types of karmas are present in the state of binding, eight types of karmas are present in the state of arising, and eight types of karmas are present in the state of existence. 3. Six types of karmas are present in the state of binding, eight types of karmas are present in the state of arising, and eight types of karmas are present in the state of existence. The explanation of these interpretations is as follows:
The first interpretation is found from the first Mithyatva Gunasthan to the seventh Apramattasanyata Gunasthan at the time of binding of Ayukarma. It is not found in the remaining Gunasthanas; because Ayukarma is not bound in other Gunasthanas. But, since Ayukarma is not bound in the mixed Gunasthan, it should not be considered here. That is, Ayukarma is not bound in the mixed Gunasthan, therefore the first interpretation is not possible there. Its time is the evidence of the inferior and superior Antarmukhurta.
The second interpretation occurs from the first Gunasthan to the ninth Anivritivadar Sampray Gunasthan. Although the third Mishran, the eighth Apurvakaran, - - - - Ihaashtavidhabandhaka Apramattalaha, Saptavidhabandhaka Aniyattiabadarasamprava Paryavasanah Padhyighabandhakascha Sukshmasamprayayah, ete cha sarve api muragah.

## Chapter of the Seven Tika
## 20

In the ninth **Anivrittibada** Gunasthan, there is no binding of **Ayukarma**, therefore, there is only the second **Bhang** (break). However, even in other Gunasthanas like **Mithyadristi** etc., there is not always binding of **Ayukarma**. Therefore, when there is no binding of **Ayukarma**, the second **Bhang** occurs. The duration of this **Bhang** is from the least, **Jghanya**, being **Antarmuhurt** (a very short time) to the most, **Utkrisht**, being thirty-three **Sagar** (oceans) which is six months less than the **Antarmuhurt** of the **Purvakoti** (previous stage) and one-third more.

The third **Bhang** occurs only in the **Sukshmasampray** Gunasthan. This is because the beings in this Gunasthan experience binding of only the remaining six karmas, excluding **Ayukarma** and **Mohaniya Karma**. The duration of this **Bhang** is from the least, **Jghanya**, being one **Samaya** (moment) to the most, **Utkrisht**, being **Antarmuhurt**.

These three **Bhangs** are formed due to the dominance of the **Bandhastanas** (binding places). Therefore, their least and most durations are explained in accordance with the durations of the **Bandhastanas** mentioned earlier.

When there is binding of one type of **Vedaniya Karma**, there are three possibilities - **Egavihe Tivi Gappo**. The explanation is as follows:

Binding of **Vedaniya Karma** occurs in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth Gunasthanas - **Upshantamoha**, **Kshinamoha**, and **Sayogikevali**, respectively. However, in the **Upshantamoha** Gunasthan, there are seven **Uday** (arising) and eight **Satta** (existence), in the **Kshinamoha** Gunasthan, there are seven **Uday** and seven **Satta**, and in the **Sayogikevali** Gunasthan, there is one **Bandha** (binding), four **Uday**, and four **Satta**. Therefore, in the situation of binding of one **Vedaniya Karma**, three **Bhangs** are obtained based on the **Uday** and **Satta** as follows:

1. One **Prakrutik Bandha**, seven **Prakrutik Uday**, and eight **Prakrutik Satta**. 

Page #59:
---------------------------
##  Pashta Karmagrantha: Chapter 3

**2.** One natural bondage, seven natural arisings, and seven natural existences. **3.** One natural bondage, four natural arisings, and four natural existences.

The first of these is destroyed in the *Upshanta-moha* Gunasthan, because there, the arising of the seven karmas occurs without the *mohaniya* karma, but the existence is of all eight karmas. Its duration is from a *jghan* (shortest) moment to an *antar-muhurt* (longest) moment.

The second is destroyed in the *Kshina-moha* Gunasthan. Because the complete destruction of the *mohaniya* karma occurs for the *kshapka* (destroyer) *sukshma-samparaya* (subtle-body) *san-yata* (controlled). Due to this, in the *Kshina-moha* Gunasthan, there is a decrease of seven in the arising and existence. Its duration is from a *jghan* (shortest) moment to an *antar-muhurt* (longest) moment.

The third is destroyed in the *Sayogika-kevali* Gunasthan. Because there, the bondage is only of one *vedaniya* karma, but the arising and existence of four *aghati* karmas are found. Its duration is from an *antar-muhurt* (shortest) moment to a *deshon-purva-koti* (longest) moment.

Thus, the above three destructions occur primarily in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth Gunasthan respectively.  "**_Egavigappo Abandhammi_**" - meaning, in the state of *abandha* (non-bondage), there is only one alternative destruction. It should be understood as follows: in the *Ayogika-kevali* Gunasthan, there is no bondage of any karma, but the arising and existence of four *aghati* karmas are found. Therefore, there, four natural arisings and four natural existences, this is the only destruction.

**1.** "**_Abandhe_**" - in the absence of bondage, there is only one alternative: that is, four types of arising and four types of existence. This is attained in the *Ayogika-kevali* Gunasthan, because due to the absence of yoga (union), there is no bondage, but the arising and existence of the *aghati* karmas occur.

*Sapta-tika Prakarana Teeka, page 14* 

Page #60:
---------------------------
## Chapter 22: Sevenfold Destruction

The duration of this destruction, both its gross and subtle phases, should be understood as being equal to the time of an antarmūhūrta, similar to the Aayogikevali Gunasthan.

Thus, there are seven types of sensory destruction in relation to the Mula Prakritis, compared to the Bandha, Udaya, and Satva Prakriti sthānas. Their details, including their Swāmi and Kāla, are given in the table on page 23.

After explaining the mutual sensory destructions of Bandha, Udaya, and Satva Prakriti sthānas in relation to the Bhūla Prakritis, we now explain these alternatives in the Jīva sthānas.

**Sattatthabandhatthavayasant terassu jīvaṭhāṇesu | Egammi yantra ganga ko bhanga hati ṇo || 4 ||**

**Meaning of the words:**

* Sattatthabandh - Bond of seven and eight,
* Atthavayasant - Eight Udaya,
* Baṭha - Eight Satva,
* Terassu - In thirteen,
* Jīvaṭhāṇesu - In Jīva sthānas,
* Egammi - In one (Paryāpta Saṃśī) Jīva sthāna,
* Pañcabhangā - Five destructions,
* Vare bhanga - Two destructions,
* Huti - Happen,
* Kevaliṇo - Of the Kevali.

**Meaning of the verse:**

In the thirteen Jīva sthānas, beginning with Ādi, there are two destructions each in the bond of seven and eight Prakritis, eight Prakritis Udaya, and eight Prakritis Satva. In the one-sense, five-sense, Paryāpta Jīva sthāna, there are five destructions from the beginning and two destructions at the end for the Kevalajnāni.

**Special meaning:**

The sensory destructions have been explained in the Jīva sthānas. The nature and differences of Jīva sthānas have been explained in the fourth Karmagrantha. Their brief summary is that Jīvas are infinite and their species are numerous, but their common equivalent form is called Jīva sthāna by collecting them through Dharmas, and fourteen of its types have been made.

1.  Aaparyāpta Sūkṣma Ekendriya,
2.  Paryāpta Sūkṣma Ekendriya,
3.  Aaparyāpta Bādar Ekendriya,
4.  Paryāpta Bādar Ekendriya,
5.  Aaparyāpta ...

## The Chapter of the Sevenfold

**The fourteen divisions of the Jiva-sthana:**

1. **Dvi-indriya** (two-sensed)
2. **Paryapta Dvi-indriya** (sufficient two-sensed)
3. **Aparyapta Dvi-indriya** (insufficient two-sensed)
4. **Paryapta Tri-indriya** (sufficient three-sensed)
5. **Aparyapta Chatur-indriya** (insufficient four-sensed)
6. **Paryapta Chatur-indriya** (sufficient four-sensed)
7. **Aparyapta Asanji Pancha-indriya** (insufficient non-conscious five-sensed)
8. **Paryapta Asanji Pancha-indriya** (sufficient non-conscious five-sensed)
9. **Aparyapta Sanji Pancha-indriya** (insufficient conscious five-sensed)
10. **Paryapta Sanji Pancha-indriya** (sufficient conscious five-sensed)

**Two types of Bhang (division) in the first thirteen Jiva-sthana:**

1. **Sevenfold Bandha (bond), eightfold Udaya (arising), and eightfold Satya (existence)**
2. **Eightfold Bandha, eightfold Udaya, and Bhava-prakriti Satya (existence)**

The verse states: "**Sattatthabandhatthadaya-santan terassu jiva-thanesu**" (Sevenfold Bandha, eightfold Udaya, and eightfold Satya in the thirteen Jiva-sthana).

**Characteristics of these Bhang:**

These two Bhang are such that the Jivas in these thirteen Jiva-sthana do not possess the ability to subdue or destroy Darshan-mohaniya (knowledge-obscuring) and Charitra-mohaniya (conduct-obscuring) karmas. Therefore, the Mithyatva (false belief) guna-sthana (state of being) is predominant. Although other guna-sthana may be present in some of these Jiva-sthana, it does not affect the Bhang.

**Timing of the Bhang:**

The first Bhang, with sevenfold Bandha, eightfold Udaya, and eightfold Satya, occurs when there is no Bandha (bond) of Ayukarma (life-span karma). The second Bhang, with eightfold Bandha, eightfold Udaya, and Bhava-prakriti Satya, occurs during the Bandha of Ayukarma.

The duration of the first Bhang is equal to the duration of each Jiva-sthana. The duration of the second Bhang is Antarmukhurta (a very short time), which is the minimum and maximum duration of Ayukarma Bandha.

**Summary:**

* **First Bhang:** Sevenfold Bandha, eightfold Udaya, eightfold Satya, occurs when there is no Ayukarma Bandha.
* **Second Bhang:** Eightfold Bandha, eightfold Udaya, Bhava-prakriti Satya, occurs during Ayukarma Bandha.
* **Duration:** First Bhang - equal to Jiva-sthana duration, Second Bhang - Antarmukhurta.

**Source:** Saptatika Prakarana Tika, page 144. 

Page #63:
---------------------------
**Sixth Karma Bandha: Verse 4**

The description of the two bhangas of the thirteen jiva sthans (states of being) from the beginning should be understood as follows:

**Jiva Sthan** | **Uday** | **Su.** | **A.** | **Ma.** | **A.** | **Ap.** | **Ba.** | **A.** | **P.** | **Dwi.** | **A30** | **Da.** | **50** | **Mo.** | **Sap.** | **Sri.** | **P.** | **Ch.** | **Ap.** | **Ch.** | **P.** | **Asan.** | **0** | **Ap.** | **Asan.** | **0** | **P.** | **San.** | **0** | **Ap.**

**Egami Panchabhang** (Five Bhangas of the Last Jiva Sthan):

The five bhangas in the fourteenth jiva sthan, which remains after the aforementioned thirteen jiva sthans, are as follows:

These five bhangas include the aforementioned two bhangas:

1. Seven natural bandha, eight natural uday and satta.
2. Eight natural bandha, eight natural uday and eight natural satta.

Along with these, there are three more bhangas:

1. Six natural bandha, eight natural uday and eight natural satta.
2. One natural bandha, seven natural uday and eight natural satta.
3. One natural bandha, seven natural uday and seven natural satta.

Thus, the total five bhangas of the **Paryapt Sanshi Panchaindriya** (Perfect Five-Senses Being) should be understood. 

Page #64:
---------------------------
## The Chapter of Seven Tika

The five bhangas of the five senses of the Paryapta Sanjni are as follows:

* Bandha (Bondage)
* Udaya (Arising)
* ...

The first bhang occurs until the Anivritti Gunasthan, the second bhang until the Aprammatta-Samyata Gunasthan, the third bhang in the Upshama Shreni or Kshapakauni, where the Sukshma-Samparaya Samyata exists, the fourth bhang in the Upshanta-Moha Gunasthan, and the fifth bhang in the Kshina-Moha Gunasthan.

Although Kevalis are also Paryapta Sanjni with five senses, and their five bhangas should also be considered, the reason for explaining their bhangas separately is that Kevali beings do not have the knowledge of Kshaya-Upshamika, therefore they are not Sanjni. Therefore, to negate their Sanjnitva, their bhangas are separately mentioned in the gatha: "There are two bhangas for Kevalis. One is their natural Bandha, four natural Udayas, and four natural Sattas - this is one bhang. And four natural Udayas and four natural Sattas, but the Bandha is not of a single nature, this is the second bhang."

The first bhang is found in Sayogika Kevalis, where there is only the bondage of one Vedaniya Karma, but the Udaya and Satta of four Aghati Karmas remain. The second bhang is of Ayogika Kevalis. Because they do not have the bondage of even one Karma, but only the Udaya and Satta of four Aghati Karmas are found. 

Page #65:

**Sixth Karma Granth: Verse 5**

**27**

The details of the breaks in the Jiva-sthana should be understood as follows:

* Bandha-prakriti, Udaya-prakriti, Satya-prakriti, Jiva-sthana, Jghanya, Utkrishta
* Bala, Antarmuhurta, Anta, Mahat
* Yathayogya, Samhi, Paryapta, Eka-samaya, Antata, Sanjo, Paryakta, Eka-samaya, Matahata
* Sayogi, Antamuhurta, Desha, Purva, Kevali
* Koti, Ayogi, Kevali, Pa, Chahrasva, Pachi, Hrasva

The pronunciation of the vowels, the duration of the pronunciation, and the time measurement should be understood accordingly.

**6 1 1 Hin**

**R**

In this way, the breaks in the perception of the Mula-karmas in the Jiva-sthana should be understood. Now, we will explain the breaks in perception in the Guna-sthana. The breaks in perception of the Mula-karmas in the Guna-sthana are as follows:

**Atthasuu Egavigappu Chassu Vi Gunasanniyesu Vuvigappu. Patteyan Patteyan Bandhodayasantakkamanam. || 5 ||**

**Word Meaning:**

* Atthasuu - Eight Guna-sthana
* Egavigappu - One break
* Chassu - Six
* Vi - And
* Gunasanniyesu - Guna-sthana
* Vuvigappu - Two breaks
* Patteyan - Each
* Patteyan - Each
* Bandhodayasantakkamanam - Bandha, Udaya, and Satya-prakriti sthana

**Verse Meaning:**

In each of the eight Guna-sthana, there is one break each for Bandha, Udaya, and Satya-prakriti karmas. And in each of the six Guna-sthana, there are two breaks each.

**Special Meaning:**

The verse mentions the breaks in Bandha found in the fourteen Guna-sthana. 

Page #66:
---------------------------
## The Chapter of the Seven Tika

The specific state of the qualities of the soul, namely knowledge, perception, and conduct, which arises due to attachment and yoga, is called **Gunasthan**.  The word **Gunasthan** is derived from **Gun** (quality) + **Sthan** (place). **Gun** refers to the qualities of the soul like knowledge, perception, etc., and **Sthan** refers to the specific states of these qualities, which arise due to the rise, subsidence, destruction, and destruction-subsidence of attachment.

There are fourteen divisions of **Gunasthan**, whose names are as follows:

1. **Mithyatva**
2. **Sasadan Samyagdristi**
3. **Samy Mithyadristi** (mixed)
4. **Avirat Samyagdristi**
5. **Deshaviret**
6. **Pramattavirat**
7. **Aparamattavirat**
8. **Apuurvakaran**
9. **Anivritibadar**
10. **Sukshmasampra**
11. **Upshantmoha**
12. **Ksheenmoha**
13. **Sayogikevali**
14. **Ayogikevali**

The first twelve divisions of these fourteen arise due to the rise, subsidence, destruction-subsidence, etc., of the **mohaniya karma**. The thirteenth, **Sayogikevali**, and the fourteenth, **Ayogikevali**, these two final **Gunasthanas** arise due to **yoga**. **Sayogikevali Gunasthan** arises due to the presence of **yoga**, and **Ayogikevali Gunasthan** arises due to the absence of **yoga**.

Out of the aforementioned fourteen **Gunasthanas**, in eight **Gunasthanas**, there is a single destruction of the **karma** in the form of bondage, rise, and existence - **Al Eggvigapppo**. The explanation of this is as follows:

In the eight **Gunasthanas** of **Samyagmithyadristi** (mixed), **Apuurvakaran**, **Anivritibadar**, **Sukshmasampra**, **Upshantmoha**, **Ksheenmoha**, **Sayogikevali**, and **Ayogikevali**, there is a single alternative of the **karma** in the form of bondage, rise, and existence. The reason for this single alternative is that in these three **Gunasthanas** of **Samyagmithyadristi**, **Apuurvakaran**, and **Anivritibadar**, due to the absence of the appropriate determination of the **ayukarma**, there is a single destruction of the seven natural bondages, eight natural rises, and eight natural existences. 

Page #67:
---------------------------
## Path Karma Granth: Chapter 5, Verse 26

**In the Sukshmasamprayaya Gunasthan, there are six natural bonds, eight natural upadayas (arising) and eight natural sattvas (existences). This is one bhang (state of being).** Because in this Gunasthan, the Badar Kshaya (negative karma) does not arise, therefore the Ayushya (life-span) and Mohaniya (delusion) karmas do not bind, but the remaining karmas do bind.

**In the Upshantamoha Gunasthan, due to the cessation of the Mohaniya karma, only seven karmas arise. There is one natural bond, seven natural upadayas and eight natural sattvas, this is one bhang.**

**In the Kshonamoha Gunasthan, there is one natural bond, seven natural upadayas and seven natural sattvas. This is one bhang.** Because in the Sukshmasamprayaya Gunasthan, the Mohaniya karma is completely eradicated, therefore it does not arise or exist.

**In the Yogikevali Gunasthan, there is one natural bond, four natural upadayas and four natural sattvas. This is one bhang.** Because in this Gunasthan, the four Bhaatikarma (physical karmas) do not arise or exist.

**In the Ayogikevali Gunasthan, due to the absence of Yoga (liberation), no karma binds, but there is one bhang with four natural upadayas and four natural sattvas.**

**After explaining the bhang-vikalpas (variations in states of being) in the eight Gunasthanas, now we will explain the bhang-vikalpas in the remaining six Gunasthanas.**

**There are two vikalpas in each of the six Gunasthanas.** The names of those six Gunasthanas are: Mithyatva, Sasadan, Avirat Samyagdristi, Deshaviret, Pramattaviret and Apramattaviret. The vikalpas found in these are:

1. **Eight natural bonds, eight natural upadayas and eight natural sattvas.**
2. **Seven natural bonds, eight natural upadayas and eight natural sattvas.**

**In these two bhangs...** 

Page #68:
---------------------------
The first case of the Salatika occurs in the bondage period of the Ayukarma, and the second alternative is always found in addition to the bondage period of the Ayukarma. 11
The collective verses of the fourteen Gunasthanas are as follows, and the details are taken from the Salatika on page 31:

**Meaning:**  The binding, arising, and existence aspects of the **Bandhodaya** (binding and arising) are explained in terms of **Maanavaran** (knowledge obscuration) and **Antaray** (hindrance) karmas.  There are five (**Panch**) aspects of each.  Even in the absence of binding (**Bandhovarme**), the arising and existence of these five aspects remain the same (**Tatha**).

**Verse Meaning:**  The binding, arising, and existence aspects of **Maanavaran** and **Antaray** karmas are five each.  Even in the absence of binding, the arising and existence of these five aspects remain the same due to their inherent nature.

**Detailed Meaning:**  Previously, the general nature of the fundamental karmas and their dissolution in relation to the **Jiva** (soul) and **Gunasthan** (quality-places) were explained.  Now, this verse begins the explanation of the dissolution of the secondary aspects of these fundamental karmas.

There are eight fundamental karmas: **Maanavaran**, **Darshanavaran**, **Vedaniya**, **Mohaniya**, **Aayu**, **Naam**, **Gotra**, and **Antaray**.  These have five, nine, two, twenty-eight, four, forty-two, two, and five secondary aspects respectively.  These secondary aspects are called the **Uttar Prakriti** (secondary nature) of the fundamental karmas.  Their names and details are discussed in the first **Karmagranth** (text on karma).  This verse explains the dissolution of the secondary aspects of **Maanavaran** and **Antaray** karmas.

The five secondary aspects of **Maanavaran** and the five secondary aspects of **Antaray**, totaling ten, bind up to the tenth **Sukshmasampray** (subtle) **Gunasthan**.  Their binding is dissolved at the end of the tenth **Gunasthan**, and their arising and existence are dissolved at the end of the twelfth **Gunasthan**.

The five aspects of **Maanavaran** and the five aspects of **Antaray** bind up to the **Sukshmasampray** **Gunasthan**.  Even in the absence of binding, their arising and existence remain the same in the **Upshantamoh** (subdued delusion) and **Kshigamoha** (diminished delusion) states.  They remain five aspects each.

**Sixth Karma Granth: Chapter 6**

**33**

Therefore, in each of these two karmas, from the tenth guna-sthana to the twelfth guna-sthana, there are five natural bonds, five natural upadayas, and five natural sattvas. This is one bhang.

Thus, there are a total of two sanved bhangs with respect to the five jnana-avaranas and the five antarayas.

Of the above two bhangs, the five natural bond-patra, five natural upadayas, and five natural sattvas, this bhang has three options: anadi-ananta, anadi-santa, and sadi-santa.

Of these, the anadi-ananta option is for those who have not attained the anadi mithyatva-drishti or the upashanta-moha guna-sthana.

The sadi-mithyatva-drishti jivas attain samyak-darshan and charitra, and by ascending the shravana, they become upashanta-moha or kshina-moha. They have the anadi-santa option.

The sadi-santa option is for those jivas who have fallen from the upashanta-moha guna-sthana.

The second option, the five natural upadayas and five natural sattvas, has a minimum duration of one time and a maximum duration of antar-muhurta.

Since this bhang occurs in the upashanta-moha guna-sthana, and the minimum duration of the upashanta-moha guna-sthana is one time, therefore, the minimum duration of this bhang is also considered to be one time.

The maximum duration of the upashanta-moha and kshina-moha guna-sthana is antar-muhurta, therefore, the maximum duration of this bhang is also considered to be antar-muhurta.

The description of the sanved bhangs of jnana-avaran and antaraya karma, along with the jiva-sthana, guna-sthana, and time, should be understood in this way.

## Chapter 34: The Sevenfold

**Time**

| **Sevenfold** | **Life** |
|---|---|
| **Uday** | **Aghanya** |
| **Gunasthan** | **Jaskruta** |
| **14 Antarmuhurta** | **Deshon** |
| **Apath** | **1 to 10 Gunasthan** |
| **Paravarta** | **5** |
| **11th** | **1 Sangni** |
| **12th** | **1 Antarmuhurta** |
| **13th** | **Paryapta** |
| **14th** | **Antarmuhurta** |

**Explanation:**

After explaining the destruction of the **Jnanaavaran** and **Antaray** karmas, we now explain the destruction of the **Darshanavaran** karma.

**Darshanavaran Karma:**

> "The **bandha** (bondage) and **satta** (existence) have three **prakriti** (nature) **sthana** (places), and two **uday** (arising) **sthana** (places), four **cha** (four), five **panag** (five), and **sanavaran** (Darshanavaran karma)." (7)

**Explanation of the verse:**

* **Bandha:** Bondage
* **Satta:** Existence
* **Prakriti Sthana:** Nature places
* **Tini:** Three
* **Tullai:** Equal
* **Uday Sthana:** Arising places
* **Duve:** Two
* **Cha:** Four
* **Panag:** Five
* **Sanavaran:** Darshanavaran karma

**Explanation of the first destruction:**

The **utkrista** (excellent) **kal** (time) **deshon** (region) **apardh** (half) **pudgal** (matter) **paravarta** (transformation) mentioned for the first destruction is in relation to the **sadi-sant** (beginning-end) **vikalp** (alternative) of **kal** (time).

* A **jiva** (soul) who falls from the **upshantmoha** (subdued delusion) **gunasthan** (quality place) and becomes **upshantmoha** (subdued delusion) or **kshinamoha** (diminished delusion) within the **antarmuhurta** (inner moment) time, experiences the **jghanya** (inferior) **kal** (time) of **antarmuhurta** (inner moment).
* A **jiva** who attains **samyadrishti** (right vision) at the beginning of the **apardh pudgal paravarta** (half matter transformation) time, ascends to **upshamni** (subdued) and becomes **upshantmoha** (subdued delusion). Later, when the remaining time to stay in the world is **antarmuhurta** (inner moment), the **jiva** ascends to **kshapkasroni** (the place of the destroyer of the body) and becomes **kshinamoha** (diminished delusion). This **jiva** experiences the **utkrista** (excellent) **kal** (time) **deshon** (region) **apardh pudgal paravarta** (half matter transformation) time.

## Sixth Karma Bandha: Verse 7

**Verse Meaning:** The binding and the nature of the Darshanavarana karma are the same. The nature of the Nagarathan is of two types: four and five.

**Explanation:** The verse describes the destruction of the sensory organs due to the Darshanavarana karma. There are nine total natures of the Darshanavarana karma. Their binding places are three: nine natures, six natures, and four natures. Similarly, the nature of existence also has these three types: nine natures, six natures, and four natures. This is explained below.

In the nine-nature binding place, all the natures of the Darshanavarana karma are bound. In the six-nature binding place, the remaining six natures excluding the Styadhitrik are bound. In the four-nature binding place, the remaining four natures, excluding the five Nidras, are bound, starting from Chakshudarshanavarana and ending with केवलदर्शनवारण.

Out of these three binding places, the nine-nature binding place occurs in the first and second Mithyatva, Sasadan-Gunasthan. The six-nature binding place occurs from the third Samyamithyadristi Gunasthan to the first part of the eighth Apurvakaran Gunasthan. The four-nature binding place occurs from the second part of the Apurvakaran Gunasthan to the tenth Sukshmasampray Gunasthan.

**From the Sapttatika Prakaran, page 156:**

* There are nine natures in total, and six excluding the Styadhitrik.
* There are four excluding the Nidra-Prachala.

**From the Sapttatika Prakaran Commentary, page 156:**

* The nine-nature binding place is in Mithyadristi and Sasadan.
* The six-nature binding place is from the Samyamithyadristi Gunasthan to the first part of the Apurvakaran.
* The four-nature binding place is from the second part of the Apurvakaran to the Sukshmasampray.

## Sixth Karma Granth: Verse 7

The peak duration of staying with Samyaktvā, separated from Mithyātva in the middle, is only this much. Afterwards, the being either attains Mithyātva or ascends the Kshapaka Shreni and becomes a Sayogikevali, ultimately attaining Siddhatva.

## 37

The minimum duration of the four-natured bandha-sthāna is one time, and the maximum duration is antar-muhūrta. A being who enters the second part of Apurvakarana, binds the four natures for one time, dies, and becomes a deva in the next time, is seen to have a minimum duration of one time for the four-natured bandha. The sum of the entire duration of the Upshama Shreni or Kshapaka Shreni is antar-muhūrta, therefore its maximum duration is also not more than antar-muhūrta.

After explaining the three bandha-sthāna of Darshanāvarana, now we clarify the three sattā-sthāna.

In the nine-natured sattā-sthāna, all the natures of Darshanāvarana karma exist. This sthāna extends up to the Upshanta-moha guna-sthāna. In the six-natured sattā-sthāna, the sattva of the remaining six natures exists, excluding the three of Styāna, Naddhi, and Trika. This sattā-sthāna extends from the second part of Kshapaka Anivritti-vadarasa-samprayaya to the penultimate time of the Kshina-moha guna-sthāna. The four-natured sattā-sthāna exists in the final time of the Kshina-moha guna-sthāna.

Regarding the duration of the nine-natured sattā-sthāna, there are two possibilities: Anadi-ananta and Anadi-sānta. The first possibility is with respect to Abhavya, and the second possibility is seen in Bhavyas, because in the course of time, the said sthāna is severed from them. The Sadi-sānta possibility is not possible here, because the severance of the nine-natured sattā-sthāna...

## The Sapttatika Chapter

**The क्षपक (Kshapaka) are present, but there is no destruction of the जीव (Jiva) from the क्षपकश्रेणि (Kshapaka Shreni).**

**The lowest and highest time for the six natural states of existence is an अन्तर्मुहूर्त (Antarmuhurta).** This is because this state exists from the second part of the क्षपक अनिवृत्ति (Kshapaka Anivriti) until the penultimate time of the क्षीणमोह गुणस्थान (Ksheenamoha Gunasthan), and its lowest and highest time is an अन्तर्मुहूर्त (Antarmuhurta) as proof.

**The lowest and highest time for the four natural states of existence is one time.** This is because this state is found in the final time of the क्षीणमोह गुणस्थान (Ksheenamoha Gunasthan).

**There are two उदयस्थान (Udayasthan) for the दर्शनावरण कर्म (Darshanavaran Karma): four natural and five natural - 'उदयठाणाई दुवे च पणगं' (Udaythanai Duve Cha Panagan).** The उदय (Uday) of the four natural उदयस्थान (Udayasthan) - चक्षु (Chakshu), अत्रक्षु (Atrakshu), अवधि (Avadhi), and केवल दर्शनावरण (Keval Darshanavaran) - is always found until the क्षीणमोह गुणस्थान (Ksheenamoha Gunasthan). Therefore, the collective form of these four is one उदयस्थान (Udayasthan). When one of the five natures - निद्रा (Nidra) etc. - is added to these four, it becomes a five natural उदयस्थान (Udayasthan). निद्रादिक (Nidradik) ध्रुवोदमा (Dhruvodama) are not natures, because their उदय (Uday) occurs when the time for उदययोग्य (Udayyogya) is obtained. Therefore, this five natural उदयस्थान (Udayasthan) is occasionally obtained.

**The reason why there are only two उदयस्थान (Udayasthan) - four natural and five natural - for the दर्शनावरण (Darshanavaran), and not six, seven, etc. natural उदयस्थान (Udayasthan), is that two or more natures do not arise simultaneously in निद्रा (Nidra), but only one nature arises at one time.**

**"For neither निद्रा (Nidra) etc. nor two or more arise simultaneously, but only one at a time." - Sapttatika Chapter Commentary, p. 157**

**Sixth Karma Granth: Verse 8**

The details of the binding, arising, and existence locations of the Darshanavarana Karma should be understood as follows:

**Binding**
**Arising**
**Existence**

**Existence 6.64** Now, we will discuss the destruction caused by the mutual interaction of the binding, arising, and existence locations of the Darshanavarana Karma.

**Biyavarane Navabandhagesu Chaupanch Uday Nav Santa. Chhachchaubandhe Chaivan Chaubandhude Chalsha Ya. || Uparayabandhe 'Bau Pan Navans Chauruvay Chhach Chausanta. ||**

**1. Comparison:**

**Vidiavarane Navabandhagesu Chadupanch Uday Navsatta. Chhabandhagesu Evam Tah Chadubandhe Chhadansa Ya. || Ubaradabandhe Chadupanchoudya Nav Chhamm Satt Chadu Jugasan. ||**

**Go. Karmakanda Ga. 631, 632** The second covering (Darshanavarana) has six natures. The one who binds these six natures has an arising of 5 or 4, and its existence is. Similarly, the one who is bound by these six natures also has an arising and existence. The one who binds four natures has an arising of 4 or 5, as mentioned earlier. Its existence is 4, and it also has an existence of 6. The one who has no binding has an arising of 4 or 5, and its existence is 9 or 6. It also has both arising and existence of 4.

## Chapter on Seven Tika

**Word Meaning - Seed Covering - Second Covering - Vision Covering:**

In the nine-fold bondage, four or five arise, nine exist. In the six and four bondage, the arising and existence are as before. In the four bondage and four arising, six exist. And when the bondage is broken, four or five arise, nine exist. Four arising, six and four exist.

**Verse Meaning:**

When the nine-fold bondage of the Vision Covering occurs, four or five arise and nine exist. When the six and four-fold bondage occurs, the arising and existence are as before. When there is four-fold bondage and four-fold arising, six exist. And when the bondage is broken, four or five arise and nine exist. When there is four-fold arising, six and four exist.

**Special Meaning:**

The verse discusses the various types of breaking of the Vision Covering karma.

The bondage of the nine-fold Vision Covering occurs in the first and second stages of false belief and the stage of destruction of the qualities. At that time, four or five arise and nine exist - "In the seed covering, in the nine-fold bondage, four or five arise, nine exist." In the four-fold arising stage, only the four Dharmic arising qualities, such as the Vision Covering of the eye, are taken into account. The five-fold arising stage is obtained by adding one of the sleep qualities to the four Dharmic arising qualities. Thus, in the nine-fold bondage of the Vision Covering karma, two types of breaking are obtained, with nine-fold existence and arising. 

Page #79:
---------------------------
## Sixfold Karma Granth: Chapter 8

1. Two-fold natural bondage, four-fold natural arising, and nine-fold natural existence. This dissolution occurs without the arising of any of the five sleep states.
41
2. Nine-fold natural bondage, five-fold natural arising, and nine-fold natural existence. This dissolution occurs with the harmonious arising of one of the sleep states, beginning with the sleep state.

It should be understood that the arising and existence are the same during the time of two-fold natural bondage and four-fold natural bondage. That is, six-fold natural bondage, four or five-fold natural arising, and nine-fold natural existence, and four-fold natural bondage, four or five-fold natural arising, and nine-fold natural existence. Of these, six-fold natural bondage, four or five-fold natural arising, and nine-fold natural existence occur in beings from the third Samyakmithyadristi Gunasthan to the first part of the Upshamaka A-purvakarana (eighth) Gunasthan. And the second, four-fold natural bondage, four or five-fold natural arising, and nine-fold natural existence occur in beings from the second part of the Upshamaka A-purvakarana Gunasthan to the Sukshma Samparaya Gunasthan.

In relation to these two places, there are a total of four dissolutions as follows:

1. Six-fold natural bondage, four-fold natural arising, and nine-fold natural existence.
2. Six-fold natural bondage, five-fold natural arising, and nine-fold natural existence.
3. Four-fold natural bondage, four-fold natural arising, and nine-fold natural existence.
4. Four-fold natural bondage, five-fold natural arising, and nine-fold natural existence.

Of the above four dissolutions, there is a special characteristic in Kshapakaṇi. Because... 

Page #80:
---------------------------
## Chapter 42

The **Kshapaka Jiva** is extremely pure, therefore it does not experience the arising of the nature of sleep and movement. This results in two **Bhangas** (breaks) for it:

* **First Bhang:** This extends from the first part of the **Apuvarkarana Gunasthan** (state of non-return) of the **Kshapaka Jiva** up to six **Prakriti** (nature) **Bandha** (bond), four **Prakriti** **Udaya** (arising), and nine **Prakriti** **Satta** (existence).
* **Third Bhang:** This extends from the numerical parts of the **Anivrittibadarasampray Gunasthan** (state of non-return) of the **Kshapaka Jiva** up to four **Prakriti** **Bandha**, four **Prakriti** **Udaya**, and nine **Prakriti** **Satta**.

Another characteristic of the **Kshapaka Jiva** to understand is that after the destruction of **Styanadhitrika** (a type of karma) in the **Anivrittibadarasampray Gunasthan**, the nine **Prakritis** do not remain. Therefore, from the numerical parts of the **Anivrittibadarasampray Gunasthan** to the end of the **Sookshma Sampray Gunasthan** (state of subtle existence), there is another **Bhang** with four **Prakriti** **Bandha**, four **Prakriti** **Udaya**, and six **Prakriti** **Satta** - "**Chaubandhudae Chalsa Ya**". This **Bhang** is distinct from the four **Bhangas** mentioned above.

Thus, we have considered how many **Bhangas** are possible with the **Darshanavarana** (veil of perception) remaining bound as much as possible. Now, considering the possible **Bhangas** of the **Darshanavarana** karma in relation to **Udaya** and **Satta**, we have: "**Uberpbandhe Cha Pan Navans**" - When the **Bandha** is broken, there are two **Bhangas** with four or five **Udaya** and nine **Satta** due to **Vikalpa** (choice). These two **Bhangas** are:

1. Four **Prakriti** **Udaya** and nine **Prakriti** **Satta**.
2. Five **Prakriti** **Udaya** and nine **Prakriti** **Satta**.

The reason for these two **Bhangas** is that in the **Upshantamoha Gunasthan** (state of subdued delusion), all nine **Prakritis** of the **Darshanavarana** exist. And due to **Vikalpa**, four or five **Prakritis** arise. 

Page #81:
---------------------------
##  Post-Firm-Granth: Chapter K

However, in the Ksheena-moha Gunasthan, there is an absence of Sthya-naddhitrika, as they are destroyed during the process of Kshapak.  Furthermore, in the penultimate stage of the Ksheena-moha Gunasthan, Nidra and Prachala also cease to exist, leaving only the four Prakritis in existence at the final stage.  In the Kshapak-shreni, Nidra etc. do not arise. Therefore, there are two following bhangs (divisions):

1. **Four Prakriti Uday (arising) and Six Prakriti Satya (existence).** This bhang is found in the penultimate stage of the Ksheena-moha Gunasthan.
2. **Four Prakriti Uday and Four Prakriti Satya.** This bhang occurs in the final stage of the Ksheena-moha Gunasthan.

To indicate these two bhangs, the Gatha says: "Bau-rudaya chhach chasanta".

##  Darshana-avaran Karma: Differences of Opinion Regarding its Components

Here, eleven Sanved-mang (sensory objects) of the Uttar Prakritis of Darshana-avaran Karma are mentioned.  Among them, the following three bhangs are also included:

1. **Four Prakriti Bandh (binding), Four Prakriti Uday, and Six Prakriti Satya.**
2. **Four Prakriti Uday and Six Prakriti Satya.**
3. **Four Prakriti Uday and Four Prakriti Satya.**

Of these three bhangs, the first occurs in the ninth and tenth stages of the Kshapak-shreni, in the Sukhsma-samparaya Gunasthan, while the second and third bhangs occur in the Ksheena-moha Gunasthan.  This suggests that the author of this Granth believed that Nidra and Prachala do not arise in the Kshapak-shreni.  Acharya Malayagiri, in his commentary on the Suptattika Prakaran, has quoted this Gatha from the Satkarma Granth: "Niss ugawane parivar". 

Page #82:
---------------------------
## The Chapter on the Seventh (Saptathika)

Triahhika does not occur in the Kshapakauni and Ksheenamoha Gunasthanas. This is also the opinion of the authors of Karma-prakriti and Panchasangraha. However, the authors of Panchasangraha were aware of the fact that five prakritis also arise in the Kshapaka श्रेणि and Ksheenamoha Gunasthanas. They have mentioned this in the verse "Panchavh vi keï ichchasi". Acharya Malayagiri has attributed this opinion to the Karmastavakar. Thus, it is known that except for the Karmastavakar, almost all the Karmagranthikars have held the opinion that Nidradvik does not arise in the Kshapakauni and Ksheenamoha Gunasthanas.

The Digambar tradition generally holds the opinion of विकल्प (alternative). In the Kashayapahuḍ Chūṇi, it is indicated that "the being who ascends the Kshapakauni, leaves behind the karma of Ayus and Vedaniya, and experiences the awakening of all other karmas." Commenting on this, Bīrasena Swami has written in the Jayadhavala Kshapanaadhikār that the being in the Kshapa श्रेणि is the नियम वेदक of five Gnanavarana and four Darshanavarana, but is the कदाचित् वेदक of Nidra and Prachala, because there is no contradiction in their possible subtle awakening.

Pat Karm Granth: Chapter 8

Gati Acharya has also accepted the same opinion in his Panchasangrah that four or five instances of Darshanavaran arise in Kshapakoni and Kshina Moh. This opinion is also accepted in the Go. Karmakand.

Thus, according to the Digambar tradition, there are four natural bonds, five natural arisings, and six natural existences. This is one bhang in the ninth and tenth Gunasthanas, and five natural arisings and six natural existences are one bhang in the Kshina Moh Gunasthan. Therefore, in the context of explaining the bhangs of the Darshanavaran karma, these two bhangs are combined, resulting in thirteen bhangs being considered in the Digambar tradition. However, in the Shwetambar tradition, there are eleven bhangs, and according to other opinions, there are two options for thirteen bhangs.

The details of the eleven or thirteen bhangs of the bond, arising, and existence of the Darshanavaran karma should be understood as follows:

## Corrupted Karma Granth: Chapter G

**Word Meaning:** 
- **Vey Kiya Uyagoe:**  Vedaniya, Ayu and Gotra Karmas (referring to the types of karmas).
- **Vibhajj:**  Bandha-adi-sthana (places of bondage) and their Sanvedha-bhang (breaking of perception).
- **Moham:**  Mohaniya Karma (karma that causes delusion).

**Verse Meaning:** 
- The verse discusses the Bandha-adi-sthana and Sanvedha-bhang of Vedaniya, Ayu and Gotra Karmas. It then moves on to discuss the Bandha-adi-sthana of Mohaniya Karma.

**Special Meaning:** 
- The verse mentions the division of Vedaniya, Ayu and Gotra Karmas, but it doesn't specify how many Bandha-adi-sthana and Sanvedha-bhang occur for each karma in relation to their respective Uttar-prakriti (subsequent nature).
- However, the commentator Acharya Malayagiri has elaborated on these aspects in his commentary.
- According to the commentary, the following are the Bhang (breaking) of Vedaniya, Ayu and Gotra Karmas:

**Breaking of Vedaniya Karma:**
- There are two types of Vedaniya Karma: Sata (true) and Asata (false).
- These two natures are mutually contradictory.
- Therefore, only one of them can be bound or arise at a time.
- It is not possible for both to be bound or arise simultaneously.
- However, both natures exist until one of them is destroyed.
- Once one nature is destroyed, only the other nature remains.
- In other words, in relation to the Uttar-prakriti of Vedaniya Karma:
    - There is only one Bandha-sthana (place of bondage), which can be either Sata or Asata, as both cannot be bound simultaneously due to their contradictory nature.
    - There is also only one Udaya-sthana (place of arising), which can be either Sata or Asata, as both cannot arise simultaneously due to their contradictory nature.
    - There are two Satta-sthana (places of existence), one for each nature.
    - Both natures exist until one of them is destroyed.
    - Once one nature is destroyed, only the other nature remains.

Page #86:
---------------------------
## Chapter 4: Sapttatika

**Bandha-sthana and Udaya-sthana are always of one nature, but Sattha-sthana is of two natures and one nature, thus there are two.**

The breaking of the perception of non-painful karma is as follows:

1. **Asaata Bandha, Asaata Udaya, and both Sattha**
2. **Asaata Bandha, Saata Udaya, and both Sattha**
3. **Saata Bandha, Saata Udaya, and both Sattha**
4. **Saata Bandha, Asaata Udaya, and both Sattha**

These four types of Bandha remain. The first two types occur from the Mithyaishti Guna-sthana to the sixth, Prammatta-samyata Guna-sthana. Because in the Prammatta-samyata Guna-sthana, the Asaata Bandha is broken, and there is no further Bandha. Therefore, in the seventh, Aprammatta-samyata, and subsequent Guna-sthana, there are only the first two types of Bandha.

The remaining two types of Bandha, the third and fourth, occur from the Mithya-drishti Guna-sthana to the Sayogikevali Guna-sthana. Because the Bandha of Saata Vedaniya occurs only until the thirteenth, Sayogikevali Guna-sthana.

In the absence of Bandha, there are four types of breaking based on Udaya and Sattha:

1. **Asaata Udaya and both Sattha**
2. **Saata Udaya and both Sattha**
3. **Asaata Udaya and Asaata Sattha**
4. **Saata Udaya and Saata Sattha**

The first two types of breaking occur until the second extreme time of the Ayogikevali Guna-sthana. Because both Sattha are found until the second extreme time of the Ayogikevali. The last two types of breaking, the third and fourth, occur in the extreme time.

In the second extreme time, when Saata is destroyed, in the final time, the third type of breaking, Asaata Udaya and Asaata Sattha, is found. And in the second extreme time, when Asaata is destroyed, in the final time, the fourth type of breaking, Saata Udaya and Saata Sattha, is found.

Chapter Five of the Sapttatika, there are nine sensory interruptions in the lifespan of a being in the state of a being in the state of a human, and five in the lifespan of a god. Their explanation is as follows:

In one instance, the arising of one (sensory interruption) is the binding of one lifespan, which is capable of being bound in all (lifespans), not two or more. Therefore, in relation to binding and arising, there is one natural binding place and one natural arising place for lifespan, but there are two natural and one natural places of existence. Because the one who has bound the lifespan of the previous existence has two natural places of existence, and the one who has not bound the lifespan of the previous existence has one natural place of existence.

Now, we will explain the sensory interruptions of the lifespan karma. There are three stages of lifespan karma:

1. The stage before the binding of lifespan karma related to the previous existence.
2. The stage of binding of lifespan related to the previous existence.
3. The stage after the binding of lifespan related to the previous existence.

These three stages are called the unbound stage, the bound stage, and the ceased stage, respectively. First, we will consider the sensory interruptions of the lifespan of hell beings.

1. In lifespan, there is generally one binding place, which is one of the four. Due to mutual opposition, there is no binding of two lifespans simultaneously. There is one arising place, which is also one of the four, due to the arising of two lifespans simultaneously. There is one place of existence, which is one of the four. As long as another lifespan of the previous existence is bound, and as long as it is bound in the previous existence and does not arise in another previous existence, it exists.

Sapttatika Commentary, page 156

2. There are three stages of lifespan, namely: the stage before the binding of the lifespan of the previous existence, the stage of the binding of the lifespan of the previous existence, and the stage after the binding of the lifespan of the previous existence.

## Sixth Karma Granth

**The emergence of Naraka-ayu (hell-life) during the period of bondage of Naraka-ayu, and the attainment of Naraka-ayu, is a type of "bhang" (break).**  There are four Gunasthanas (stages of spiritual progress) in Narakas (hells), and since the remaining Gunasthanas are not present, this "bhang" is possible only in the initial four Gunasthanas.

**In the period of bondage, there are two types of "bhang":**

1. **The bondage of Tiryancha-ayu (animal life), the emergence of Naraka-ayu, and the attainment of Tiryancha-Naraka-ayu.**
2. **The bondage of Manushya-ayu (human life), the emergence of Naraka-ayu, and the attainment of Manushya-Naraka-ayu.**

Since there is no rule for the bondage of Deva-ayu (divine life) in Naraka-jivas (hell beings), only these two options are possible. The first "bhang" occurs in the Mithyatva and Sasadan Gunasthanas, because the bondage of Tiryancha-ayu only extends up to the second Gunasthana. The second "bhang" occurs in the Mithyatva, Sasadan, and Avirat Samyagdristi Gunasthanas, because there is no rule for the bondage of Manushya-ayu in the Mithyatva Gunasthana. This is because the bondage of Manushya-ayu is found in these three Gunasthanas of Narakas.

**In the period of "Uparatbandha" (cessation of bondage), there are two types of "bhang":**

1. **The emergence of Naraka-ayu and the attainment of Naraka-Tiryancha-ayu.**
2. **The emergence of Naraka-ayu and the attainment of Naraka-Manushya-ayu.**

These two "bhangs" are possible in the initial four Gunasthanas of Narakas. This is because after the period of bondage of Tiryancha-ayu, a Naraka-jiva can become Avirat Samyagdristi (steadfastly right-seeing) or Samyamihyadristi (partially right-seeing). Avirat Samyagdristi Narakas also experience the bondage of Manushya-ayu, and after bondage, such a being can also attain the Samyamihyadristi Gunasthana, making the second "bhang" possible in the initial four Gunasthanas.

**1. Naraka-devas (hell-gods) and Naraka-ayus do not bind themselves due to the belief in rebirth, because they are born there.**

**Sapttatika Prakarana Toka, page 156** 

Page #90:
---------------------------
The Saptaatika chapter states that in the hellish realm, there are five types of lifespan-related breaks: one in the state of non-attachment (abandha), two in the state of attachment (bandha), and two in the state of upper attachment (uparabandh).  

Regarding the lifespan-related characteristics of the hellish realm, it is important to understand that hellish beings do not bind to the lifespans of gods or hell beings by nature. This is because, according to the rules, hell beings do not get reborn in the realms of gods or hell after death. 

The implication is that beings in the animal and human realms can be reborn in all four realms after death, but gods and hell beings are only reborn in the animal and human realms. 

Here is a description of the lifespan-related breaks in the hellish realm:

| Break Time | Attachment | Quality Place |
|---|---|---|
| Non-attachment Time | Non-attachment | Hell |
| Attachment Time | Attachment | Hell |
| Upper Attachment Time | Upper Attachment | Hell |

Although it is necessary to discuss the lifespan-related breaks in the animal realm after the hellish realm, the five breaks and their quality places are described in the same way for the god realm as they are for the hellish realm. 

Page #91:
---------------------------
These are the karmic states. However, it is important to note that instead of saying "narakayu" (hellish state), we should always say "devayu" (divine state). For example, we should say "devayu's rise," "devayu's existence," etc.

The five phases of devayu are as follows:

1. **Devayu's rise and devayu's existence (abandhakal)**
2. **Tiryach's bondage, devayu's rise, and tiryach devayu's existence (bandhakal)**
3. **Manushya's bondage, devayu's rise, and manushya devayu's existence (bandhakal)**
4. **Devayu's rise and dev tiryach's existence (uparatbandhakal)**
5. **Devayu's rise and dev manushya's existence (uparatbandhakal)**

The details of these phases are as follows:

| Phase | Kal | Tiryach | Manushya | Dev | Kshetra | Gunasthan |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Abandhakal | 0 | 0 | Dev | Dev | 1, 2, 3, 4 |
| 2 | Bandhakal | Tiryach | 0 | Dev | Tiryach, Dev | 1, 2 |
| 3 | Bandhakal | 0 | Manushya | Dev | Tiryach, Manushya | 1, 2, 4 |
| 4 | Uparatbandhakal | Tiryach | 0 | Dev | Dev, Tiryach | 1, 2, 3, 4 |
| 5 | Uparatbandhakal | 0 | Manushya | Dev | Dev, Manushya | 1, 2, 3, 4 |

**Tiryach's Relationship Phases:**

There are nine variations of the ayukarma (life-span karma) in the tiryach (animal) realm. These are as follows:

In the abandhakal (state of no bondage), the rise of tiryach and the existence of tiryach is one phase. This is because...

**Note:** The text provided is incomplete and ends abruptly. The full explanation of the nine variations of ayukarma in the tiryach realm is missing. 

Page #92:
---------------------------
## The Sapta-Tika Chapter

This chapter is found in the first five **guna-sthana** (stages of spiritual development). This is because the **tiryanch-gati** (animal realm) only has the first five **guna-sthana**, and not the remaining ones.

During the **bandha-kal** (period of bondage) in the **tiryanch-gati**, there are four types of **bhang** (breakdowns):

1. **Naraka-ayu** (hellish life) bondage, **tiryanch-ayu** (animal life) arising, and the existence of **marak-tiryanch-ayu** (death-animal life).
2. **Tiryanch-ayu** bondage, **tiryanch-ayu** arising, and the existence of **tiryanch-tiryanch-ayu** (animal-animal life).
3. **Manushya-ayu** (human life) bondage, **tiryanch-ayu** arising, and the existence of **manushya-tiryanch-ayu** (human-animal life).
4. **Deva-ayu** (divine life) bondage, **tiryanch-ayu** arising, and the existence of **deva-tiryanch-ayu** (divine-animal life).

The first **bhang** occurs in the **mithya-drishti** (false belief) **guna-sthana**, as **naraka-ayu** bondage does not occur in any other **guna-sthana**. The second **bhang** occurs in the **mithya-drishti** and **sasa-dan** (doubtful) **guna-sthana**, as **tiryanch-ayu** bondage only occurs up to the **sasa-dan** **guna-sthana**. The third **bhang** also occurs in the first two **guna-sthana** - **mithya-drishti** and **sasa-dan**, as **tiryanch** beings only bind **manushya-ayu** in the **mithya-drishti** and **sasa-dan** **guna-sthana**, not in the **avirata-samyak-drishti** (unwavering right belief) and **desh-virata** (detached) **guna-sthana**. The fourth **bhang** occurs in four **guna-sthana** - from the third **samyak-mithya-drishti** (mixed belief) **guna-sthana** to the fourth **desh-virata** **guna-sthana**, excluding the third **samyak-mithya-drishti** **guna-sthana**. The **samyak-mithya-drishti** **guna-sthana** does not have **ayukarma** (karma related to lifespan) bondage, so it is not included here.

Similarly, there are four **bhang** during the **uparat-bandha-kal** (period of cessation of bondage):

1. **Tiryach-ayu** arising and the existence of **narak-tiryanch-ayu**.
2. **Tiryach-ayu** arising and the existence of **tiryanch-tiryanch-ayu**.
3. **Tiryach-ayu** arising and the existence of **manushya-tiryanch-ayu**.
4. **Tiryach-ayu** arising and the existence of **deva-tiryanch-ayu**.

These four **bhang** occur in the first five **guna-sthana**, because any **tiryanch** that has bound **naraka-ayu**, **tiryanch-ayu**, and **manushya-ayu**... 

Page #93:
---------------------------
The sixth Karmagrantha is the one where the other Gunasthanas are found. Thus, in the Tiryanch-gati, there are a total of nine bhangas, compared to the Abandha, Bandha, and Uparatbandha. The details of the Ayukarma Sangas in the Tiryanch-gati are as follows:

**Mang Kram**

**Bal** | **Bandha** | **Avandha** | **Bandhakal** | **Narak Tiryanch** | **Manushya** | **Dev** | **Uday** | **Satta** | **Gunasthan** | **Tiryanch** | **Tithanch** | **Tiryanch** | **Manushya** | **Dev**
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
| | | | | | | | | | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | 30 | 1 | | | | |
| | | | | | | | | | 1, 2 | | | | | |
| | | | | | | | | | 1, 2 | | | | | |
| | | | | | | | | | 1, 2, 4, 5 | | | | | |
| | | | | | | | | | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | | | | | |
| | | | | | | | | | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | | | | | |
| | | | | | | | | | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | | | | | |

The bhangas of Narak, Dev, and Tiryanch-ayu in relation to Manushya-ayu have already been discussed. Now, we will discuss the remaining bhangas of Manushya-ayu. There are also nine bhangas in Manushya-ayu. They should be understood as follows:

In the Avandhakal of Manushya-gati, there is only one bhang - the uday of Manushya-ayu and the satta of Manushya-ayu. This bhang occurs in all fourteen Gunasthanas, from the first to the fourteenth. This is because all fourteen Gunasthanas are possible in Manushya-gati.

In the Bandhakal:

1. The bandha of Narak-ayu, the uday of Manushya-ayu, and the satta of Narak-Manushya-ayu.
2. The bandha of Tithanch-ayu, the uday of Manushya-ayu, and the satta of Tiryanch-Manushya-ayu.
3. The bandha of Manushya-ayu, the uday of Manushya-ayu, and the satta of Manushya-Manushya-ayu.
4. The bandha of Dev-ayu, the uday of Manushya-ayu, and the satta of Dev-Manushya-ayu.

These four bhangas occur. 

Page #94:
---------------------------
The chapter on Sapta-tika is the first among those that deal with the seven stages of the soul's progress (guna-sthana). The first stage of bondage (bandha) is to the hellish existence (naraka-ayu), which is possible only in the state of false belief (mithya-drishti). The second stage of bondage is to the animal existence (tiryancha-ayu), which extends up to the second guna-sthana. Therefore, the second stage of bondage (bhang) occurs in the two guna-sthana of false belief (mithya-drishti) and the state of being attached to worldly pleasures (sasadan). The third stage of bondage also occurs in the guna-sthana of false belief and the state of being attached to worldly pleasures, because humans, like those in the animal realm, are bound to the human existence (manushya-ayu) up to the second guna-sthana. The fourth stage of bondage occurs in six guna-sthana, from the second guna-sthana to the seventh guna-sthana of perfect restraint (aprammat-samyata), excluding the mixed guna-sthana. This is because the bondage to the heavenly existence (deva-ayu) in the human realm is found up to the guna-sthana of perfect restraint.

There are four stages of bondage during the period of upward bondage (uparasambandha-kala): 1. The emergence of the human existence and the presence of the hellish-human existence, 2. The emergence of the human existence and the presence of the animal-human existence, 3. The emergence of the human existence and the presence of the human-human existence, and 4. The emergence of the human existence and the presence of the heavenly-human existence. The first three stages of bondage are found up to the seventh guna-sthana of perfect restraint. This is because, although the bondage to the hellish existence occurs in the first guna-sthana, the bondage to the animal existence occurs up to the second guna-sthana, and similarly, the bondage to the human existence also occurs up to the second guna-sthana, yet after being bound, such beings may adopt restraint (samyama), but they do not ascend in the hierarchy (shreni-aroha). Therefore, in comparison to upward bondage, the presence of the hellish, animal, and human existences is indicated up to the guna-sthana of perfect restraint. The fourth stage of bondage is possible up to the eleventh guna-sthana, because a human who has been bound to the heavenly existence can ascend in the hierarchy of subduing passions (upashama-shreni). Thus, in the human realm, there are a total of nine stages of bondage in relation to non-bondage (abandha), bondage (bandha), and upward bondage (uparasambandha), according to the karma of lifespan (ayukarma). 

Page #95:
---------------------------
The sixth _karmagrantha_ (text on karma) discusses the characteristics of the breaking of the _uparatbandha_ (upper bondage) in relation to human existence. It states that in _tiyanchgaati_ (animal realm), the existence of _narakayu_ (hellish life), _tiryanchyaayu_ (animal life), and _manushyaayu_ (human life) is possible up to the fifth _gunasthan_ (stage of spiritual progress), while in human existence, the existence of these three is possible up to the seventh _aprammat_ (non-distracted) _gunasthan_. There is a difference of opinion regarding this.

Devendrasuri, in the second _karmagrantha_ called 'Karmastava', in the section on 'Sattaadhikār' (right to existence), writes that from the first to the eleventh _gunasthan_, the existence of 148 _prakritis_ (karmic substances) is possible, except for the second and third _gunasthan_. Further, in the same text, he writes that from the fourth to the seventh _gunasthan_, there are 141 _prakritis_ possible due to the removal of the four _anantaanubandhi_ (infinitely binding) _tuska_ (karmic particles) and the destruction of _darshanamohatrik_ (karmic particles related to perception and delusion). In the remaining four _gunasthan_ (first, second, third, and fourth), there are 142 _prakritis_ possible without the six _prakritis_ of the four _anantaanubandhi_ _tuska_, _narakayu_, and _tiryanchyaayu_.

The essence of the above statement is that: 1. The existence of all four types of life is possible up to the eleventh _gunasthan_ in relation to the _uparatbandha_. 2. The existence of _narakayu_, _tiryanchyaayu_, and _manushyaayu_ is possible up to the seventh _gunasthan_ in relation to the _uparatbandha_. Thus, two opinions arise.

The second opinion is supported by the _Panchasangraha_ (Five Collections) in the section called 'Saptaatika-Sangraha', verse 106, and the commentary on the _Brihatkarmastava_. However, the sixth verse of the same section in the _Panchasangraha_ presents a different opinion, stating that the existence of _narakayu_ is possible up to the fourth _gunasthan_, and the existence of _tiryanchyaayu_ is possible up to the fifth _gunasthan_. 

Page #96:
---------------------------
## The Sapta-Tika Chapter

The existence of a human lifespan (Manushya-ayu) is found up to the fourteenth Gunasthan, the existence of a celestial lifespan (Deva-ayu) up to the eleventh Gunasthan, and the existence of a lifespan of the liberated soul (Deva-ayu) up to the fifth Gunasthan. This is the view found in the Digambar texts as well as in the Karmakanda.

This is the only view found.

The description given here is according to the second view - Uparatbandha - which states that the existence of a lifespan in hell (Naraka-ayu), animal lifespan (Tiryancha-ayu), and human lifespan (Manushya-ayu) is found up to the seventh Gunasthan. Acharya Malayagiri has discussed this view in the Sapta-Tika commentary: "In the case of a bound being, the emergence of a human lifespan is possible until the seventh Gunasthan, as the possibility of attaining restraint (Samyama) exists even after being bound to a hellish lifespan. The emergence of a human lifespan from an animal lifespan is also possible until the seventh Gunasthan. The emergence of a human lifespan from a human lifespan is also possible until the seventh Gunasthan. The emergence of a human lifespan from a celestial lifespan is possible until the seventh Gunasthan, as the possibility of ascending the ladder of liberation (Upashama) exists even when bound to a celestial lifespan." Sapta-Tika Commentary, page 160.

This view is mainly found in the Shvetambar Karma literature. The nine stages of the destruction of the senses (Sanvedha-bhang) in the human path should be understood as follows:

| Stage | Time | Bond | Unbound | Bond Time | Destruction | Birth | Existence | Gunasthan |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | All fourteen Gunasthan |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |  |  | Hell, Human | 1, 2 |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  | Human | 1, 2 |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |  |  | Human | 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 |
| 5 |  |  |  |  |  |  | Human | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 |
| 6 |  |  |  |  |  |  | Human | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 |
| 7 |  |  |  |  |  |  | Human | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 |
| 8 |  |  |  |  |  |  | Human | 1 to 11 Gunasthan |
| 9 |  |  |  |  |  |  | Human |  |

## Sixth Karma Granth

Thus, there are 5+1+9+5 = 28 total bhangas of Ayukarma in the four gatis. In each gati, there is a rule given in Go. Karmakanda Ga. 645 for bringing about the bhangas of Ayukarma:

"Ekkaus tibhang sambhavauhi tajie gana. Jive ibhibhang gunamsarithe."

The essence of this is that in whatever gati there is a bandha of a certain number of ayus, multiply that number by three. Then, subtract one less than the number of ayus that can be bound. This will give you the total bhangas in each gati, considering the bhangas of Ayubandha, Bandha, and Uparatbandha. For example, in Deva and Naraka, there is a possibility of bandha of two ayus each. Therefore, there are six bhangas in each. Now, subtract one less than the number of ayus that can be bound, which is one. This leaves us with five bhangas in Naraka gati and five bhangas in Deva gati. In Manushya and Tiryanch gati, there is a bandha of four ayus. Multiplying four by three gives us twelve. Now, subtract three, which is one less than the number of ayus that can be bound. This leaves us with nine bhangas in Manushya gati and nine bhangas in Tiryanch gati. Therefore, we should understand that there are five bhangas in Deva and Naraka, and nine bhangas in Manushya and Tiryanch.

These bhangas should be understood in the context of the four ayus in Narakadi gati, in the order of Mithyadristi Gunasthan. In the second Gunasthan, there are bhangas without the bandha of Narakayu. Therefore, there are 5, 8, 8, and 5 bhangas there. The bhangas mentioned earlier, in relation to Ayubandha, are all less than these.

## Chapter 70

**On the Dissolution of Karma**

In the mixed karma-state, there are a minimum of 3, 5, 5, 3 dissolutions in the hell, etc. realms. In the fourth karma-state, there are four dissolutions each in the deva and hell realms, as the bondage of the tiryanchayu does not dissolve. In the human and tiryancha realms, there are six dissolutions each, as the bondage of the ayu and mantra does not dissolve. This is because the absence of their bondage occurs in the sasadan karma-state. In the deshavirat karma-state, there are three dissolutions each for the tiryancha and humans, in relation to the andha, abandha, and uparatabandhas. In the sixth and seventh karma-states, there are three dissolutions each in relation to the bondage of the human and deva ayu. Thus, in the seven karma-states of mithyadrishti, etc., the total number of dissolutions is a minimum of 28, 26, 16, 20, 6, 3, 3.

After considering the dissolutions of vedaniya and ayu karma, we now consider the dissolutions of gotra karma.

**Dissolutions of Gotra Karma**

There are two types of gotra karma: uchchagotra and nichagotra. In a single lifetime, a being experiences the bondage of one and the arising of the other. This is because the bondage or arising of both is mutually exclusive. When uchchagotra is bound, nichagotra is not bound, and vice versa.

**Additional Dissolutions**

In addition to these dissolutions, the gotra karma section mentions some additional dissolutions of ayu karma in the human realm, in relation to upshamashrani and kshapakani. In upshamashrani, there are two dissolutions each in relation to the abandha and uparatabandhas of the deva ayu, as the deva ayu is not bound. In kshapakani, there is only one dissolution in relation to the abandha, as the uparatabandhas are absent. Therefore, in the four karma-states of upshamashrani, there are two dissolutions each, and in kshapakani, there is one dissolution each from the apurvakarana to the ayogikevali karma-state. 

Page #99:
---------------------------
The Sixth Karma Grantha should be understood in the same way regarding the concept of 'udaya' (arising). The reason for the binding or arising of one at a time is their mutually contradictory nature, but both natures can exist simultaneously. There is no contradiction in the simultaneous existence of both. However, there is a special feature that Agni Kayik and Vayu Kayik beings also experience 'udvalana' (elevation) of the higher 'gotra' (lineage). Therefore, these beings who experience 'udvalana', or when these beings are born in other 'ekendriya' (one-sense) etc., only the lower 'gotra' exists for some time. After that, when the higher 'gotra' is bound, both exist. Even the 'ayogikevali' (non-liberated) beings experience the decay of the lower 'gotra' in their final moments, at which time only the higher 'gotra' exists.

The summary of the above statement regarding the binding, arising, and existence of 'gotra karma' in relation to the 'sthana' (place) is that the binding 'sthana' of 'gotra karma' is also one 'prakriti' (nature), the arising 'sthana' is also one 'prakriti', but the existence 'sthana' is both two 'prakriti' and one 'prakriti'.

Also, in general, the binding 'sthana' of 'gotra' is either the higher 'gotra' or the lower 'gotra', ... because of the mutual contradiction of the two, they cannot exist simultaneously. The arising 'sthana' is also one, and that too is one of the two, because of the mutual contradiction of the two, they cannot arise simultaneously.

## Chapter 7: The Sevenfold Breakage

After explaining the general breakage of the lineage karma, we now explain the breakage of the senses in these places. There are seven types of breakage of the senses in lineage karma:

1. **Bondage of low lineage, arising of low lineage, and existence of low lineage.**
2. **Bondage of low lineage, arising of low lineage, and existence of low-high lineage.**
3. **Bondage of low lineage, arising of high lineage, and existence of high-low lineage.**
4. **Bondage of high lineage, arising of low lineage, and existence of high-low lineage.**
5. **Bondage of high lineage, arising of high lineage, and existence of high-low lineage.**
6. **Arising of high lineage and existence of high-low lineage.**
7. **Arising of high lineage and existence of high lineage.**

The first breakage occurs in fire-bodied and air-bodied beings who are capable of uplifting the high lineage. This breakage occurs in one-sensed, two-sensed, and five-sensed animals until the end of their lifespan. This is because after the end of their lifespan, the bondage of high lineage occurs naturally for these one-sensed and other beings.

The second and third breakage are found in the two gunasthana (stages of qualities) of **mithyadrishti** (false belief) and **sasadan** (attachment). This is because the bondage and liberation of low lineage are found in two states of existence:

* **One state:** When both high and low lineages are present, the high lineage is uplifted in the fire-bodied and air-bodied state.
* **Another state:** When the low lineage is not suitable for the liberation of the soul and is weakened at an inappropriate time.

The sixth *karmagrantha* becomes the second *gunasthan*. The connection of these two *bhangas* is with the bondage of the lower *gotra*, therefore their harmony is described in the first and second *gunasthanas*, and further in the third *samyagmishiyat* etc. *ganasthanas*. The fourth *bhang* etc. are possible in the five *gunasthanas* because the rise of the lower *gotra* is possible up to the fifth *gunasthan*, therefore the absence of *pramattasanyata* etc. is mentioned in the further *gunasthanas*. The bondage of the higher *gotra* occurs up to the tenth *mukshmasampray* *gunasthan*, therefore the fifth *bhang* etc. are possible in the ten *gunasthanas*, because the bondage of the higher *gotra* is intended in this *bhang*. Due to which its prohibition is mentioned in the further *gunasthanas*. The sixth *bhang* - the rise of the higher *gotra* and the existence of the higher-lower *gotra* - occurs from the *upshantmoha* *munasthan* to the two extreme times of the *ayogikevali* *gunasthan*. Because the existence of the lower *gotra* is found only up to this point and the existence of the lower *gotra* is implied in this *bhang*. The seventh *bhang* occurs at the final time of the *ayogikevali* *gunasthan*. Because the rise of the higher *gotra* and the existence of the higher *gotra* are found at the final time of the *ayogikevali* *gunasthan* and the rise and existence of the higher *gotra* are collected in this *bhang*.

The description of the above seven *bhangas* of *gotrakarma* is as follows:

| *Mangakrama* | *Bandha* | *Gunasthan* | *Nīca* | *Udaya* | *Satta* | *Nīca* | *Nīca* |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 | 1 to 10 *gunasthanas* |  |  |  |  |

## Chapter on Sapttatika

Regarding the Gotra Karma Bhang (breaking of Gotra Karma) in relation to Gunasthanas (stages of spiritual progress), there are at least five and four Bhangs in Mithyadristi and Sasadan Gunasthanas respectively. In the three Gunasthanas of Misra, etc., there are two Bhangs each. In the eight Gunasthanas of Prammatta, etc., there is one Bhang each for Gotra Karma, and in the Agogidevali Gunasthan, there are two Bhangs.

After explaining the Bhangs of Vedaniya, Ay, and Gotra Karma, as per the previous information, we now discuss the Bandhastanas (places of bondage) of Mohaniya Karma, etc., as per the statement "Moham Param Voccham" (Moha is the ultimate).

**Mohaniya Karma**

Twenty-two, twenty-one, seventeen, thirteen, nine, five, four, three, and one are the Bandhastanas of Moha.

(a) There are two types of Bandha Karma, namely Iyar and Do. There are two types of A-Bandha (non-bondage) in the three types of Niyasa (deposits).

(b) The Bhangs of Mischadi, etc., are four, three, two, and one in the eight Gunasthanas. Each Jogi (ascetic) has two types of Karma. This is a rule.

**Comparison**

(a) Twenty-two, twenty-one, seventeen, thirteen, nine, five, two, and one are the Bandhastanas of Moha.

(b) Twenty-two, seventeen, thirteen, nine, five, four, three, and one are the Bandhastanas of Moha. The bondage of these is in the four, three, two, and one types of Karma.

## Sixth Karma Granth

**Three, two, and one-one natural great city locations, Mohass-Mohaniya Karma's**

Twenty-two natural, twenty-one natural, seventeen natural, thirteen natural, nine natural, five natural, four natural, three natural, two natural, and one natural, thus there are ten Bandha-sthana. In the Visheva-Gatha, 'Mohass Bandhattanani' describes the Bandha-sthana of Mohaniya Karma. These Bandha-sthana are twenty-two, twenty-one, etc., totaling ten in number. Their explanation is given below.

_Mohaniya Karma has twenty-eight Uttar Prakriti. Among these, there are three Prakriti of Darshan Mohaniya: Samyaktva, Sambhamithyatva, and Mithyatva. Since Bandha does not occur in both Sambhamithyatva and Samyamihyatva, there remain twenty-six Bandha-yoga Prakriti. Due to the mutual opposition of some Prakriti during Bandha and the separation in Gunasthana, there are ten Bandha-sthana of Mohaniya Karma, starting with twenty-two Prakriti._

**The collection of Gatha for the Prakriti in the ten Bandha-sthana of Mohaniya Karma are as follows:**

*Michcham Kamavasolas Bhayakuchcha Tindaveyamanmaram. Hasarai Iyar Yala Pa Bandhapaydi Ya Bavisam. Igavisa Michchavina Napubandhavina Ra Sasane Bandhe. Anarhiyaa Sattaras Nabandhi Thii Turi Athanamami. Viyasamparayana Teras Tah Tasyauun Nav Bandhe. May-Kuchcha-Jugal Paaye Pan Bandhe Bayare Thane! Tah Puris Koh Ahankara-Mayalomasa Bandhavocchae. Chau-Ni-Dug Em Bandhe Kamen Mohassa Dasthana. - Sixth Karma Granth Prakrit Tippana, Ramdevni Virachit, Gatha 22 to 25*

## Chapter on the Seven Tika

The first of the ten bondage places of mohaniya karma is the twenty-two prakritis. This is because the three vedas do not bind together, but only one veda binds at a time. Whether it be the purushaveda, striveda, or napumsakaved, and the hasya-rati pair and the arati-shok pair, only one pair binds at a time. Both pairs do not bind together. Therefore, out of the twenty-six prakritis, when two vedas and one pair from the two pairs are reduced, twenty-two prakritis remain. The binding of these twenty-two prakritis occurs in the mithyaishti gunasthan.

_When mithyatva is reduced from the aforementioned twenty-two prakriti bondage place, there are twenty-one prakriti bondage places. This place occurs in the sasadan gunasthan. Because the severance of mithyatva occurs first in the mithyatva gunasthan. Although the napumsakaved does not bind in the second sasadan gunasthan, its fulfillment by the binding of the purushaveda or striveda keeps the number at twenty-one._

The binding of the anantanubandhi kshaya chatushk occurs only up to the second gunasthan. Therefore, when the anantanubandhi chatushk is removed from the twenty-one prakritis, the mixed and avira samyagdristi - third and fourth gunasthan - have seventeen prakriti bondage places. Although the striveda does not bind in these gunasthanas, the binding of the purushaveda there makes it seventeen prakriti bondage places.

The deshaviriti gunasthan has thirteen prakriti bondage places. Because the apratyakhyanavaran kshaya chatushk binds only up to the fourth avira samyagdristi gunasthan. Therefore, when the apratyakhyanavaran chatushk is reduced from the seventeen prakriti bondage places, the fifth deshaviriti gunasthan has thirteen prakriti bondage places. 

Page #105:
---------------------------
The fourfold complex of *pratyakhyanavaran* and *kashaya* binds until the fifth *guna-sthana*, *desh-virati*. Therefore, after reducing the fourfold complex of *pratyakhyanavaran* and *kashaya* from the aforementioned thirteen *prakritis*, there are nine *prakriti* binding places in the sixth, seventh, and eighth *guna-sthana* - *pramatta-samyata*, *aprammatta-samyata*, and *apuurva-karan*. Although the pair of *arati* and *shoka* binds only until the sixth *guna-sthana*, due to the fulfillment of the seventh and the rest by *hasya* and *rati*, there remains only nine *prakriti* binding places.

The binding of the four *prakritis* - *hasya*, *rati*, *bhaya*, and *jugupsa* - occurs until the last moment of the eighth *guna-sthana*. Therefore, after reducing these four *prakritis* from the aforementioned nine *prakriti* binding places, there are five *prakriti* binding places in the first part of the ninth *guna-sthana*, *anivritti-badar-samparaya*. In the second part, there is no binding of *purusha-veda*, therefore there are four *prakritis*. In the third part, there is no binding of *sanjvalana-krodha*, therefore there are three *prakritis*. In the fourth part, there is no binding of *sanjvalana-mana*, therefore there are two *prakritis*. And in the fifth part, there is no binding of *sanjvalana-maya*, therefore there is one *prakriti* binding place. Thus, in the five parts of the ninth *guna-sthana*, *anivritti-badar-samparaya*, there are five *prakriti*, four *prakriti*, three *prakriti*, two *prakriti*, and one *prakriti* binding places.

Furthermore, in the tenth *guna-sthana*, *sukshma-samparaya*, there is also an absence of one *prakriti* binding place. Because there, the *badar* *kashaya*, which is the cause of the binding of *mohaniya-karma*, is not found. Thus, there are a total of ten binding places for the *uttar* *prakritis* of *mohaniya-karma*.

**Time and Owner of the Ten Binding Places**

The owner of the twenty-two *prakriti* binding places is the *mithyadrishti* *guna-sthana-varti*. 

Page #106:
---------------------------
The seven categories of *tikā* are the *jīva*. There are three types of *bandha-sthāna* in terms of time: *anādi-ananta*, *anādi-sānta*, and *sādi-sānta*. Of these, the *anādi-ananta* option is with respect to *abhavya*s, because their twenty-two natural *bandha-sthāna* are never absent. The *anādi-sānta* option is with respect to *bhakshya*s, because in due course, the cessation of their twenty-two natural *bandha-sthāna* is certain. Or, those who have deviated from *samyaktva* due to *anyatva* and have attained *mithyātva*, and who in due course attain *samyaktva* again, have the *sādi-sānta* option. Because this option is *kāda-cittka*, therefore, it has a beginning and an end. With respect to this *sādi-sānta* option, the minimum time for the twenty-two natural *bandha-sthāna* is *antar-muhūrta* and the maximum time is *deśon-apādham-pudgala-parāvṛtta* measure.

The *jīva* residing in the *sāsādana* *guṇa-sthāna* is the owner of the twenty-one natural *bandha-sthāna*. The minimum time for the *sāsādana* *guṇa-sthāna* is one *samaya* and the maximum time is six *āvala*s. Therefore, the time measure for this *bandha-sthāna* should also be understood as stated. The *jīva* residing in the third and fourth *guṇa-sthāna*s are the owners of the seventeen natural *bandha-sthāna*. The minimum time for this *sthāna* is *antar-muhūrta* and the maximum time is *sādhika-te-tīs-sāgara*. The *jīva* residing in the *deśa-virata* *guṇa-sthāna* is the owner of the thirteen natural *bandha-sthāna*. The minimum time for the *deśa-virata* *guṇa-sthāna* is *antar-muhūrta* and the maximum time is *deśon-pūrva-koṭi-varṣa* measure. Therefore, the minimum and maximum time for the thirteen natural *bandha-sthāna* should be understood as such. The nine natural *bandha-sthāna* are found in the sixth, seventh, and eighth *guṇa-sthāna*s. The minimum time for this *bandha-sthāna* is *antar-muhūrta* and the maximum time is *deśon-pūrva-koṭi-varṣa* measure. Although the maximum time for the sixth, seventh, and eighth *guṇa-sthāna*s is not more than *antar-muhūrta*, yet the change is less than the sixth and...

##  The Bond of Karma (Vastu Karmagranth)
**66**

A being can remain in the seventh Gunasthan for a period of time equal to the Deshon Purvakoti. Therefore, the highest duration of the natural bond is equal to the said measure. The five, four, three, two, and one natural bonds are in the five parts of the ninth Anivrittibadar Samparaya Gunasthan. The lowest duration of each of these bonds is one time period, and the highest duration is one Antarmuhurt. Because the lowest duration of each part of the ninth Gunasthan is one time period, and the highest duration is one Antarmuhurt. The following is a description of the ten bonds of Mohaniya Karma, along with their duration:

| Bond | Duration | Gunasthan |
|---|---|---|
| First | 22 Pra | 1 |
| Second | 21 Pra | 2 |
| Third | 17 Pra | 3, 4 |
| Fourth | 13 Pra | 5 |
| Fifth | 6 Pra | 6, 7, 8 |
| Sixth | Bhumi | 9th part 1 |
| Seventh |  " | 9th part 2 |
| Eighth |  " | 9th part 3 |
| Ninth |  " | 9th part 4 |
| Tenth |  " | 9th part 5 |

**Duration:**

* Antarmuhurt = One time period = Antarmuhurt
* Lowest = One time period
* Highest = Deshon Apar = Six Avali Sadhik = 33 Sagar Deshon Purvakoti = Antarmuhurt

**Comparison:**

* Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, and one.
* Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, and one.

**Note:**

* The ten bonds of Mohaniya Karma are described above. Now, the description of the Udayasthanas is given.
* One, two, and four. These are the ten Udayasthanas.
* There are nine Udayasthanas for Mohaniya Karma.

## Chapter on Seven Tika

**Word Meanings:** 
* Evi - one, Da - and, Do - two, Va - and, Uro - four, Eso - further, Ekkahiya - one nature more, Is - till, Chakkosa - excellent, Ohej - common, Mohanijje - in mohaniya karma, Udayadvaana - place of origin, Nav - nine, Havanti - are.

**Verse Meaning:** 
One, two and four, and four plus one nature more till the tenth excellent nature, these nine places of origin are common in mohaniya karma.

**Detailed Meaning:** 
In the Gan, it is mentioned that there are nine places of origin. The number of these places of origin is one, two, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine and ten natures.

**Explanation:** 
These places of origin are mentioned in the reverse order. There are three types of counting: 1. Purvanupurvi, 2. PaschadAnupurvi, and 3. YatraTatranupurvi. The explanation is as follows: Counting in the order in which the substance originated or was established by the Sutrakar is Purvanupurvi. Counting from the end to the beginning is PaschadAnupurvi. Counting from any desired point, considering the desired substance as the first, is YatraTatranupurvi. Here, the author has counted the places of origin of mohaniya karma in the reverse order, following the PaschadAnupurvi method.

The origin of mohaniya karma occurs till the tenth subtle Sampraya Gunasthan. Therefore, according to the reverse order of counting, the place of origin of one nature is in the subtle Sampraya Gunasthan, because there is the origin of Sanjwalan Lobha. It should be understood that the ninth Gunasthan has lost the Vedas. 

Page #109:
---------------------------
From the first moment of the sixth karma-anya to the last moment of the subtle-samparaya guna-sthana, there is an arising of the sanjvalana lobha, which is described as a natural arising in the subtle-samparaya guna-sthana.

When one of the three Vedas is added to this one natural arising, there are two natural arisings, which occur from the first moment of the ninth anivritti-badar samparaya guna-sthana to the last moment of the sa-vedha-bhaga.

When one of the pairs of hasya-rati or arati-shoka is added to these two natural arisings, there are four natural arisings. There are not three natural arisings because the addition (yoga) of one of the pairs of hasya-rati or arati-shoka to the two natural arisings results in four. Therefore, four natural arisings are described. When the bhaya-prakriti is added to these four natural arisings, there are five natural arisings. When the jugupsa-prakriti is added to this, there are six natural arisings. These three arisings occur in the sixth, seventh, and eighth guna-sthana.

When one of the prakritis of the pratyakhyana-avaran kshaya chatushk is added to these six natural arisings, there are seven natural arisings. This occurs in the fifth guna-sthana. When one of the prakritis of the apratyakhyana-avaran kshaya chatushk is added to this, there are eight natural arisings. This arising occurs in the fourth and third guna-sthana. When one of the prakritis of the ananta-anubandhi kshaya chatushk is added to these eight natural arisings, there are nine natural arisings. This occurs in the second guna-sthana, and this nine natural...

There are ten natural *udayasthanas* when *mithyatva* is combined with the *sapta tika* section. This *udayasthan* occurs in the *miyadristi* *gunasthan*. The aforementioned nine *udayasthanas* of *mohaniya karma* have been explained in general. Because in the third *misra gunasthan*, *misra mohaniya* arises, and from the fourth to the seventh *gunasthan*, *vedak samyagdristi* arises. Therefore, instead of explaining all the options, here it is considered as information. A detailed description is being given further. The *jghanyakal* of each *udayasthan* is one *samaya* and the *utkrushtkal* is *antarmuhurt*. The details of the *udayasthanas* of *mohaniya karma* are as follows:

| Time | *Udayasthan* | *Gunasthan* |
|---|---|---|
| *Jghany* | 10 | Ninth *aved* part and tenth | One *samaya* |
| *Utkrusht* |  |  | *Antarmuhurt* |
|  | 9 | Ninth *savad* part |  |
|  | 6, 7, 8 | 6, 7, 5 |  |
|  | 4, 3 | 4, 3 |  |
|  | 1 |  |  |

The *sangrahaniya* verses of the nine *udayasthanas* of *mohaniya karma* are as follows: (a) *Ega-yar samparayam veyajuyam doshni juyalajuy chauro. Pakamkkhanegapare pridhe panv payavio.*

## The Chapter of the Seven Tika

**Special Meaning:** The two verses mentioned above have explained the number of natures in the spheres of existence of the mohaniya karma. It has been stated that a particular sphere of existence has a certain number of natures. After indicating the differences in the spheres of existence, information has been given about the multiplicity of the sensory impairments in the spheres of bondage, arising, and existence. Their description will be given further as the context arises.

Indicating the number of spheres of existence of mohaniya karma, the sage has said, "Taani mohass huthi pataras" - there are fifteen spheres of existence of mohaniya karma natures. The explanation of how many natures are in each of these fifteen spheres of existence is as follows: twenty-eight, twenty-seven, twenty-six, twenty-four, twenty-three, twenty-two, twenty-one, thirteen, twelve, eleven, five, four, three, two, and one nature. In total, there are fifteen spheres of existence.

## Sixth Karma Granth

This section discusses the twenty-eight **prakriti** states of existence, where all types of **mohaniya karma** are present. This state exists from the **mithyatva** **guna-sthana** to the eleventh **upshanta-moha** **guna-sthana**. The shortest duration of this state is **antar-muhurta**, and the longest duration is **saadhik** one hundred and thirty-two **sagars**. 

Here's the explanation:

When a **mithyatva** being with twenty-six **prakriti** states attains **upshama samyak-tva** and gains twenty-eight **prakriti** states, and within **antar-muhurta** time, they achieve **vedak samyak-tva** and disconnects from the **ananta-anubandhi chatushk**, becoming a being with twenty-four **prakriti** states, then the shortest duration of the twenty-eight **prakriti** state is **antar-muhurta**. 

The longest duration, **saadhik** one hundred and thirty-two **sagars**, is understood as follows:

A **mithyatva** being attains **upshama samyak-tva** and becomes a being with twenty-eight **prakriti** states. Subsequently, they attain **vedak samyak-tva** and remain in **samyak-tva** for the first sixty-six **sagars**. Then, they remain in **samy-mithyatva** for **antar-muhurta** time and again attain **vedak samyak-tva**, remaining in **samyak-tva** for another sixty-six **sagars**. Finally, they attain **mithyatva** and through the **udvalana** of **samyak-tva** **prakriti** for a period equivalent to an immeasurable fraction of the most excellent **paly** of **samyak-tva** **prakriti**, they become a being with twenty-seven **prakriti** states. Thus, the longest duration of the twenty-eight **prakriti** state is one hundred and thirty-two **sagars**, which is more than an immeasurable fraction of **paly**.

Although such a being may ascend to the **kshapka** category and attain other states of existence without falling into **mithyatva**, they do not achieve the aforementioned longest duration. Therefore, it is not mentioned here.

## Chapter 18: The Infinitely Connected 'Har Ki Shika: Mala'

**The 28th Natural State of Being** is attained when the four infinitely connected **Kashaya** (passions) are disjoined from the **Atthais Prakritik Satta** (28th Natural State of Being). 

**Both the Svetambara and Digambara Acharyas** agree that the **Samyagdarshi** (perfectly enlightened) being disjoins the four infinitely connected **Kashaya**. However, the **Jayadvala Tika** mentions another opinion. It states that there are two opinions regarding the **Upshama Samyagdarshi** (partially enlightened) being disjoining the four infinitely connected **Kashaya**.

**One opinion** believes that the duration of **Upshama Samyaktva** (partial enlightenment) is short, and the duration of disjoining the four infinitely connected **Kashaya** is long. Therefore, the **Upshama Samyagdarshi** being does not disjoin the four infinitely connected **Kashaya**.

**The other opinion** believes that the duration of **Upshama Samyaktva** is longer than the duration of disjoining the four infinitely connected **Kashaya**. Therefore, the **Upshama Samyagdarshi** being also disjoins the four infinitely connected **Kashaya**.

The **Jayadvala Tika**, based on the **Uccarana Vrittis** (oral traditions), gives precedence to this second opinion.

**The Superior Duration of the 28th Natural State of Being: A Difference of Opinion**

The **Panchasangraha**'s **Saptatika Sangraha** verse 45 and its commentary state that the superior duration of the **28th Natural State of Being** is **one hundred and thirty-two Sagaras** more than an **asankhyata** (incalculable) part of a **Paly** (a unit of time). However, the **Digambara tradition** states that its superior duration is **one hundred and thirty-two Sagaras** more than **three asankhyata** parts of a **Paly**.

The explanation for this difference is:

**Svetambara literature** states that a being with **26 Natural States of Being** who is **Mithyavritti** (falsely believing) becomes **Upshama Samyagdarshi** (partially enlightened) by abandoning **Mithyatva** (falsehood). Accordingly, in the final stage of the **Udvallana** (awakening) of **Kshevala Samyaktva** (perfect enlightenment), the being... 

Page #115:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karma Granth

**77** A being with 28 natural states of existence cannot attain **Upshama Samyaktv**. The maximum duration of their existence is **132 Sagaras plus an innumerable fraction of a Paly**. This is because a being with 28 natural states of existence who remains in **Vedak Samyaktv** for 66 Sagaras and then attains **Samyagdristi**, and subsequently remains in **Vedak Samyaktv** for another 66 Sagaras, and finally becomes a **Mithyadristi** for a period of an innumerable fraction of a Paly, cannot exist for a longer duration. This is because after this period, they will inevitably become a being with 27 natural states of existence.

However, according to **Digambar literature**, a **Mithyadristi** with 26 or 27 natural states of existence will inevitably attain **Upshama Samyaktv**. But a being with 28 natural states of existence, whose time for attaining **Vedak Samyaktv** has passed, will also attain **Upshama Samyaktv**. Therefore, the maximum duration of a being with 28 natural states of existence becomes **132 Sagaras plus three innumerable fractions of a Paly**.

For example, a **Mithyadristi** being attains **Upshama Samyaktv** and becomes a being with 20 natural states of existence. After attaining **Mithyatva**, they would have become a being with 27 natural states of existence after an innumerable fraction of a Paly, the maximum duration of **Samyaktv**. However, instead of that, they attain **Upshama Samyaktv** again at the end of this period. Subsequently, they wander in **Samyaktv** for the first 66 Sagaras and then attain **Mithyatva**. Again, they attain **Upshama Samyaktv** at the end of the maximum duration of **Samyaktv**, which is an innumerable fraction of a Paly. After that, they wander in **Samyaktv** for another 66 Sagaras and finally attain **Mithyatva**. They then exist for an innumerable fraction of a Paly...

---------------------------
## The Chapter of the Twenty-Seven Tika

By comparing the state of Samyaktvā with the time factor, a being attains the state of twenty-seven Prakṛtis. Thus, the duration of the twenty-eight Prakṛti state is three asamkhyeya parts of a palya plus 132 sagaras.

In this way, some differences of opinion leave the twenty-seven Prakṛtis as the beginning of the Mohaniya Karma.

**Indicating the States of Being**

Out of the aforementioned twenty-eight Prakṛti states of being, when the Prakṛti of Samyaktvā is removed, the state of twenty-seven Prakṛtis remains. This state belongs to the Mithyādṛṣṭi and the Mithyādṛṣṭi, and its duration is one asamkhyeya part of a palya. The reason for this is that after the removal of the Samyaktvā Prakṛti, it takes one asamkhyeya part of a palya for the Samyag-Mithyātva Prakṛti to be removed. As long as the Samyag-Mithyātva Prakṛti is being removed, the being remains in the state of twenty-seven Prakṛtis. Therefore, the duration of the twenty-seven Prakṛti state is said to be one asamkhyeya part of a palya.

When the Samyag-Mithyātva Prakṛti is removed from the twenty-seven Prakṛti state by the process of removal, the state of twenty-six Prakṛtis remains. This state also belongs to the Mithyādṛṣṭi being. From the perspective of time, there are three possibilities for this state: 1. Anadi-Ananta, 2. Anadi-Santa, 3. Sadi-Santa. Out of these, the Anadi-Ananta possibility is expected for Abhavya beings, because their thirty-six Prakṛti state has no beginning or end. The Anadi-Santa possibility is found in Bhavyas. Because the Anadi Mithyādṛṣṭi Bhavyas have a beginningless twenty-six Prakṛti state, but when they attain Samyaktvā... 

Page #117:
---------------------------
The sixth karma-graya, then, is seen as the end of this state. The Sadi-Sant alternative is the Sadi Mithyaishti of the Jiva. Because the Sadi Mithyaishti Jiva, who has twenty-five natural states, has attained the twenty-six natural states by the agitation of Samyaktv and Samyamithyatv, the destruction of this twenty-six natural state is seen again.

Of the three alternatives of the twenty-six natural states, the Sadi-Sant alternative has the shortest duration of Antarmuhurt and the longest duration of Deshona Aparth Pudgal Paravart. This is how it manifests: The Jiva who has attained the twenty-six natural states and has attained Samyaktv by Vikaran in Antarmur, and has become twenty-eight natural states again, attains the shortest duration of Antarmuhurt. And any Anadi Mithyadrishti Jiva who has attained Upsham Samyaktv and has gone into Mithyatv, has attained the twenty-six natural states by the agitation of Samyaktv and Samyamithyatv through the time of an uncountable part of Paly. He remains Mithyadrishti until the time of the remaining Aparth Pudgal Paravart, but when the time remaining to stay in the world is Antarmuhurt, he becomes Samyagdristi again. Thus, the longest duration of the twenty-six natural states is an uncountable part of Paly, less than Aparth Pudgal Paravart.

When the four Kashayas of Anantanubandhi are disjoined from the twenty-eight natural states of Mohaniya Karma, the twenty-four natural states are attained. This state is found from the third to the eleventh Gunasthan. Its shortest duration is Antarmuhurt and its longest duration is one hundred and thirty-two Sagars. The shortest duration is attained when the Jiva has disjoined the four Anantanubandhi Kashayas and attained the twenty-four natural states. 

Page #118:
---------------------------
If a being attains the **Saptaatika** stage and destroys **Mithyatva** within the shortest possible time, which is an **Antarmuhurta**, then the shortest duration of their **Twenty-four Natural States of Existence** is also **Antarmuhurta**. After the **dissociation of the Infinitely Connected** (Anantanubandhi), a **Vedak** with **Samyagdristi** remains in **Samyaktva** for 66 **Sagars** (oceans of time), then becomes **Samyamihyadristi** for an **Antarmuhurta**, and then again remains in **Samyagdristi** for 66 **Sagars**. Subsequently, **Mithyatva** is destroyed. Thus, the total time from the **dissociation of the Infinitely Connected** to the destruction of **Mithyatva** is 132 **Sagars**. Therefore, the longest duration of the **Twenty-four Natural States of Existence** is said to be 132 **Sagars**.

After the destruction of **Mithyatva**, there are **Twenty-three Natural States of Existence**, which are found from the fourth to the seventh **Gunasthanas**. The shortest and longest duration of this stage is **Antarmuhurta** because the destruction of **Samyamihyadristi** takes place within **Antarmuhurta**.

After the destruction of **Samyamihyadristi**, there are **Twenty-two Natural States of Existence**. This stage is also found from the fourth to the seventh **Gunasthanas**. Its shortest and longest duration is **Antarmuhurta** because the destruction of **Samyaktva** takes this much time.

After the destruction of **Samyaktva** and the **Mohaniya** nature, there are **Twenty-one Natural States of Existence**. This stage is found from the fourth to the eleventh **Gunasthanas**. Its shortest duration is **Antarmuhurta** and the longest duration is **Sadhik Tetis Sagars**. The shortest duration is considered **Antarmuhurta** because a **Kshayik Samyagdarshan** (one who has destroyed the karmas and attained liberation) ...

Sixth Karmagranth

It is possible to attain the क्षपक श्रेणी and destroy the eight middle कषायों within the time of an अन्तर्मुहूर्त. The उत्कृष्टकाल for this is thirty-three सागर because the जीव can remain in the twenty-one प्रकृतिक सत्तास्थान for that duration.

Of the twenty-one प्रकृतिक सत्तास्थान, the four अप्रत्याख्यानावरण and four प्रत्याख्यानावरण, these eight प्रकृति are destroyed, resulting in thirteen प्रकृतिक सत्तास्थान. This is attained in the ninth गुणस्थान of the क्षपक श्रेणी. Its जघन्य and उत्कृष्ट time is an अन्तर्मुहूर्त. This is because it takes an अन्तर्मुहूर्त to attain twelve प्रकृतिक सत्तास्थान from thirteen प्रकृतिक सत्तास्थान.

From these thirteen प्रकृतिक सत्तास्थान, when the नपुंसक वेद is destroyed, twelve प्रकृतिक सत्तास्थान is attained. This is also attained in the ninth गुणस्थान and its जघन्य and उत्कृष्ट time is an अन्तर्मुहूर्त. This is because it takes an अन्तर्मुहूर्त to attain eleven प्रकृतिक सत्तास्थान from twelve प्रकृतिक सत्तास्थान.

A जीव who ascends to the क्षपक श्रेणी with the उदय of नपुंसक वेद, experiences the क्षपणा of नपुंसक वेद along with the destruction of स्त्रीवेद. Therefore, such a जीव does not attain twelve प्रकृतिक सत्तास्थान. For a जीव who has attained twelve प्रकृतिक सत्तास्थान through the destruction of नपुंसक वेद, the destruction of स्त्रीवेद results in eleven प्रकृतिक सत्तास्थान. This is attained in the ninth गुणस्थान. Its जघन्य and उत्कृष्ट time is an अन्तर्मुहूर्त. This is because it takes an अन्तर्मुहूर्त for the destruction of the six नोकषायों like हास्य.

From eleven प्रकृतिक सत्तास्थान, the destruction of the six नोकषायों results in five प्रकृतिक सत्तास्थान. Its जघन्य and उत्कृष्ट time is...

## The Chapter of the Seventies
## 82

Two times less two Avali is the measure. Because when six Nokshayas are destroyed, the Sattva of the Purushaveda is seen for two times less two Avali time. After that, when the Purushaveda is destroyed, there are four Prakrutis, and when the Sanjwalan Kosa is destroyed from the four Prakrutis, there are three Prakrutis, and when the Sanjwalan Mana is destroyed from the three Prakrutis, there are two Prakrutis, which is the Sattaasthan. These are attained in the ninth Gunasthan. Their inferior and superior time is Antarmuhurt.

From the two Prakrutis Sattaasthan, when the Sanjwalan Maya is destroyed, there is one Prakruti Sattaasthan. This is attained in the ninth and tenth Gunasthan, and its time is inferior and superior Antarmuhurt.

The order of the aforementioned twenty-eight Prakrutis and fifteen Sattaasthan of the Mohaniya Karma has been briefly explained by Acharya Malayagiri. Due to its usefulness, the aforementioned portion is presented here in its original form:

"Seventeen
Eighty
Twenty. Then, when Samyaksya is ignited, ninety. Then, when Samyaksya is in the middle, eighty-six, when it is destroyed, eighty-two. Twenty-eight, when the eight Karmas are destroyed, twenty. Then, when Mithyatva is destroyed, twenty-three. Then, when Samyagmithyatva is destroyed, twenty-two. Then, when Samyaksya is destroyed, twenty-one. Then, in the eight Pratyakhyana, Pratyakhyana Avarana, and Sanjna, in the stories, in the Shroṇa, thirteen. Then, when Napumsaka is destroyed, twelve. Then, when Striveda is destroyed, eleven. Then, when six Nokshayas are destroyed, five. Then, when Purushaveda is destroyed, four. Then, when Sankalan Kosa is destroyed, three. Then, when Sanvalan Mana is destroyed, two. Then, when Sanjwalan Maya is destroyed, one Prakruti remains."

The opinion of the Digambara literature regarding the owner and time of the Sattaasthan is the same as the opinion of the Shwetambara Karmagranthik literature. Digambara Karma Sahithya 1, Sapttatika Prakaran Tika, page 163. 

Page #121:
---------------------------
## Sixth Firm Granth

The Sixth Firm Granth also mentions fifteen Satta Sthana (states of existence) of the Mohaniya Karma (karma that can be destroyed). Both literatures are mostly similar regarding their owners and time. However, there are different opinions in Digambar literature regarding some places, which are being presented for the information of the readers. The opinion of Digambar literature regarding the time of twenty-eight natural Satta Sthana has been mentioned earlier. The remaining places are being explained here.

In Shwetambar literature, the owner of twenty-seven natural Satta Sthana is mentioned as Mithyadrishti (false-sighted) and Samyagmiyadrishti (right-sighted) Jiva (soul). But according to the Digambar tradition, the owner of this place in the Chuni of Kashayaprabhut is mentioned as only Mithyadrishti Jiva.

The question arises: "How long do these twenty-seven states of existence last?" The commentary on the 45th chapter of the Sapta Tika Sangrah of Panchasangrah mentions the time of twenty-seven natural Satta Sthana as an immeasurable part of a Paly (a very long time). But there is an indication in Jayadhwala that the owner of twenty-seven natural Satta Sthana can also be Upshama Samyagdrishti (a soul who has attained the state of liberation). This is also confirmed by the Chuni of Kashayaprabhut. Accordingly, the minimum time of twenty-seven natural Satta Sthana becomes one time. Because, in the second time after attaining twenty-seven natural Satta Sthana, the one who has attained Upshama Samyaktva (liberation) is seen to have twenty-seven natural Satta Sthana for only one time.

In Shwetambar literature, the minimum time of twenty-six natural Satta Sthana from Sadi to Sant is mentioned as Antarmuhurt (a very short time). But in the Purna of Kashayaprabhut, the minimum time of the said place is mentioned as one time.

"What is the relationship between the time of these states of existence?" The answer is: "It is as mentioned above." 

Page #122:
---------------------------
The term "Saptaatika Prakarana" signifies that when a being is about to be reborn, and the remaining time is less than an "Antarmuhurta" (a very short period), the process of "Trikarana Kriya" (threefold action) begins. After rebirth, the being attains "Upshama Samyaktv" (state of perfect knowledge) after a certain period of time. The "Jghanya Kala" (minimum time) for the 26 "Prakrutik Satasthan" (natural states of existence) is one "Samaya" (a unit of time).

The "Karm Granth" (text on karma) states that the "Utkrisht Kala" (maximum time) for the 24 "Pravrutik Satasthan" (states of existence due to karma) is 132 "Sagars" (a unit of time). However, the "Kshaya Prabhruta Chuni" (a commentary) mentions that the "Utkrisht Kala" for the same states is 132 "Sagars" plus a little more.

The explanation for this is given in the "Jayadhwala Tika" (a commentary) as follows: A being who has attained "Upshama Samyaktv" and has completed the "Bisayojana" (process of understanding the world) of "Ananta Anubandhi" (infinite karmic influences) remains in "Vedak Samyaktv" (state of perfect knowledge) for 66 "Sagars". Then, for the remaining "Antarmuhurta", the being remains in "Samyagmidhyahristi" (state of right faith). Finally, the being experiences "Mithyatva" (falsehood). Thus, the total time from the completion of "Bisayojana" of "Ananta Anubandhi" to the experience of "Mithyatva" is 132 "Sagars" plus a little more.

Both traditions agree that the "Jghanya Kala" for the 21 "Prakrutik Satasthan" is "Antarmuhurta" and the "Utkrisht Kala" is 33 "Sagars". The "Kshaya Prabhruta Chuni" states:

"Ekkaisaa Bihatti Kevachir Kalaado? Jahanen Antomuhutan, Upakassen Tettisan Sagarovamani Sadireyaani."

The "Jayadhwala" explains this "Utkrisht Kala" as follows: A "Samyagdristi" (person with perfect knowledge) who is a "Dev" (god) or a "Narak" (hell being) dies and is reborn as a human being with a lifespan of one "Purva Koti" (a unit of time). After eight years, the being experiences "Ant..." 

Page #123:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karma Granth 85

In the final moments of his life, he attained क्षायिक सम्यग्दर्शन. After death, he was reborn as a god in the thirty-three heavens, where he lived for an entire lifespan. Upon completion of that lifespan, he was reborn as a human in the first koti, where he lived for an entire lifespan with the twenty-one types of सत्ता. In the final moments of his life, he ascended to the क्षपक श्रेणि and attained the thirteen आदि सत्तास्थान. He experienced these twenty-one types of सत्तास्थान for eight years, minus the final moments, plus two पूर्वकोटि years, and the lifespan of the thirty-three heavens.

This is how the Digambara literature explains the highest lifespan of the Teliy Sagar.

The Shvetambara literature states that the shortest and longest duration of the twelve types of सत्तास्थान is the final moments. However, the Digambara literature states that the shortest duration of the twelve types of सत्तास्थान is one moment. As mentioned in the कषायप्राभृत चूर्णि:

"How long is the time for the वरि वारस विहत्ती? It is just one moment."

The Jayaghavla commentary explains this as follows:

When a जीव ascends to the क्षपक श्रेणि due to the rise of the नपुंसक वेद, in the final moments, all the good deeds of the स्त्रीवेद and नपुंसक वेद are transferred to the पुरुषवेद. Subsequently, for one moment, the जीव experiences the twelve types of सत्तास्थान, because the नपुंसक वेद has not yet been destroyed.

Therefore, one should be aware of the differences in opinion regarding the owners of certain सत्तास्थान and the duration of time. This is a subject of curiosity for those who engage in comparative studies.

## Sixth Karma Granth

One should say one of the Vedas. Therefore, here, multiplying two pairs by two Vedas results in four bhangas.

Out of twenty-one natural bandha sthana, subtracting the Anantanubandhi Chatushk results in seventeen prakrutik bandha sthana. The bound beings in this are the third and fourth gunasthana beings. Since the Anantanubandhi kshaya does not arise, they do not have the bandha of Striveda. Therefore, here, there are two bhangas from the alternative of the Hasyarati Mugal and Shokarati pairs.

There are also two bhangas in thirteen natural bandha sthana. This bandha sthana is obtained by reducing the Apratyakhyanavaran kshaya Chatushk from seventeen natural bandha sthana. Here, only the bandha of Puspalet occurs, therefore, two bhangas are obtained due to the two pairs.

Reducing the Pratyakhyanavaran Chatushk from thirteen natural bandha sthana results in nine natural bandha sthana. This place is found in the sixth, seventh, and eighth - Pramattasanyata, Apramattasanayata, and Apurvakaran gunasthana. Here, there is a special feature that the bandha of Arati and Shoka occurs only up to the Pramattasanyata gunasthana, not beyond. Therefore, in the Pramattasanyata gunasthana, there are two bhangas of this place, which are mentioned earlier, and in the Apramattasanayata and Apurvakaran, only one bhang of Hasyarati form is found.

Five natural bandha sthana are obtained by reducing Hasy, Rati, Bhaya, Jugupsa, these four prakritis from the aforementioned nine natural bandha sthana. Here, one should see two bhangas for the Navabandhaka in Pramattasanyata, and only one bhang in Apramattasanayata and Apurvakaran. This is because the bandha of Arati-Shoka form Mugal is possible there.

- Saptaatika Prakaran Tika, Page 164 

Page #128:
---------------------------
## The Chapter of the Sevenfold

There is only one type of destruction (of karma). This is because there are no alternatives for the natures that bind. Similarly, due to the lack of alternatives for the binding natures, there is only one type of destruction in the four, three, two, and one-natured binding places - **ekkekkam-o par-am bhang-a**.

**60**

Thus, the total number of destructions of the ten binding places of mohaniya karma is 6+4+2+2+2+1+1+1+1+1 = 21.

After explaining the ten binding places of mohaniya karma, the next three verses describe the arising places (udayasthan) that are attained in each of these binding places.

**Arising Places in the Binding Places of Mohaniya Karma**

**It-to ubandhai is-ke-sh-kuvaya havati savye vi. Bandho-varame vi taha uday-a-bha-ve vi ya hoj-ja.**

**Word Meanings:**

Page #129:

## Sixth Karma Pratya

**Iso** - After this, in the four etc. (4, 3, 2, 1) natural bondage places, **iccudiya** - with the arising of one by one nature, **havanti** - there are, **sabjevi** - in the absence of all bondage, **vibhi**, **sahar** in the same way, **uvayabhave** - in the absence of arising, **vi-mi**, **wa** - alternative, **hojja** - there are.

**Gatha** - In twenty-two natural bondage places, from seven to ten, in twenty-one natural bondage places, from seven to nine, in seventeen natural bondage places, from six to nine, and in thirteen natural bondage places, from five to eight -

In nine natural bondage places, from four to the excellent seven natures, there are four arising places, and in five natural bondage places, one should know the arising of two natures.

After this (after five natural bondage places), in four etc. (4, 3, 2, 1) natural bondage places, there is the arising of one nature. In the absence of bondage, in the same way, there is the arising of one nature. In the absence of arising, the existence of the mohaniya is by alternative.

**Vishesharth** - Previously, twenty-two, twenty-one etc. natural ten bondage places of mohaniya karma have been explained. Here, in three gatha, it has been clarified how many natures arise in each of the said places.

First, while stating the arising places in twenty-two natural bondage places, it has been said - seven natural, eight natural, nine natural, and ten natural, these are four arising places. Their explanation is being done below. 

Page #130:
---------------------------
## The Sevenfold Nature of Arising

The sevenfold nature of arising is as follows:

1. **Mithyatva** (False Belief)
2. **Apratyaakhyanavaran** (Non-Rejection Covering) - One of the types of **Krodha** (Anger)
3. **Pratyaakhyanavaran** (Rejection Covering) - One of the types of **Krodha** (Anger)
4. **Sanjvalan** (Agitation) - One of the types of **Krodha** (Anger)
5. **Rati** (Attachment) or **Hasya** (Laughter)
6. **Arati** (Aversion) or **Shoka** (Grief) - In place of **Rati** (Attachment)
7. **One of the three Vedas**

These seven natures arise in a **Mithyatvadrishti** (False Belief) being, who is bound by twenty-two **Prakritis** (Natures), in a regular manner.

## Twenty-Four Types of Dissolution

There are twenty-four types of **Bhang** (Dissolution). They are as follows:

**Krodha** (Anger), **Mana** (Pride), **Maya** (Delusion), and **Lobha** (Greed) - These four **Prakritis** (Natures) are mutually contradictory in terms of their arising. Therefore, they do not arise simultaneously.

For example, when **Krodha** (Anger) arises, **Mana** (Pride) etc. do not arise. However, when one type of **Krodha** (Anger) arises, all other types of **Krodha** (Anger) beyond that type must arise.

For instance, when **Anantanubandhi Krodha** (Anger with infinite attachments) arises, all four types of **Krodha** (Anger) - **Apratyaakhyanavaran** (Non-Rejection Covering), etc. - arise simultaneously.

When **Apratyaakhyanavaran Krodha** (Non-Rejection Covering Anger) arises, all three types of **Krodha** (Anger) - **Pratyaakhyanavaran** (Rejection Covering), etc. - arise.

When **Pratyaakhyanavaran Krodha** (Rejection Covering Anger) arises, both types of **Krodha** (Anger) arise simultaneously.

When **Sanjvalan Krodha** (Agitation Anger) arises, only that type of **Krodha** (Anger) arises.

In this way, in the sevenfold nature of arising, **Apratyaakhyanavaran Krodha** (Non-Rejection Covering Anger) etc. arise.

Similarly, when **Apratyarupananavaran Mana** (Non-Rejection Covering Pride) arises, three types of **Mana** (Pride) arise. When **Apratyaakhyanavaran Maya** (Non-Rejection Covering Delusion) arises, three types of **Maya** (Delusion) arise. And when **Apratyaakhyanavaran Lobha** (Non-Rejection Covering Greed) arises, three types of **Lobha** (Greed) arise.

The arising of these four **Bhang** (Dissolution) - **Krodha** (Anger), **Mana** (Pride), **Maya** (Delusion), and **Lobha** (Greed) - occurs along with **Striveda** (Female Veda). If **Striveda** (Female Veda) is replaced by **Purushaveda** (Male Veda), then... 

Page #131:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karma Granth

- The **udaya** (arising) of a **purusha** (male) **veda** (knowledge) occurs with the **udaya** of the **veda**, and if the **udaya** is of a **napumsaka** (neuter) **veda**, then it is accompanied by **intar** (a type of subtle matter). Thus, with the **udaya** of each **veda**, four **bhang** (subtle bodies) are obtained, totaling twelve. These twelve **bhang** also occur with the **udaya** of **hasya** (laughter) and **rati** (attachment), and if **shoka** (sorrow) and **arati** (aversion) arise in place of **hasya** and **rati**, they are also accompanied by them. Thus, multiplying twelve by two results in twenty-four **bhang**.

- The twenty-four **bhang** mentioned earlier can also be calculated as follows: with the **hasya-rati** pair, there is one **bhang** of the **stri** (female) **veda**, and with the **shoka-arati** pair, there is one **bhang** of the **stri** **veda**, thus two **bhang** with the **stri** **veda**. Similarly, there will be two **bhang** each with the **purusha** **veda** and the **napumsaka** **veda**. In total, these are six **bhang**. These six **bhang** will occur with **krodha** (anger) in the **udaya** of the **kosa** (sheath). If **mana** (pride) arises instead of **krodha**, they will occur with **mana**. If **maya** (delusion) arises in place of **mana**, they will also occur with **maya**, and if **lobha** (greed) arises in place of **maya**, they will also occur with **lobha**. Thus, multiplying the aforementioned six **bhang** by four, namely **krodha**, **mana**, **maya**, and **lobha**, results in a total of twenty-four **bhang**. That is, six **bhang** of **krodha**, six **bhang** of **mana**, six **bhang** of **maya**, and six **bhang** of **lobha**. This is one **chaubisi** (set of twenty-four).

- In the **udaya** of these seven **prakriti** (nature), one **kashaya** (passion) from among **bhaya** (fear), **jugupsa** (disgust), and the **anantaanubandhi** (infinitely connected) quartet arises. Thus, by combining the **udaya** of one **prakriti** from these three **prakriti** respectively, the **udaya** of eight **prakriti** is obtained in three ways. Combining **bhaya** with the seven **prakriti** **udaya** results in the first **udaya** of eight **prakriti**, combining **jugupsa** with the seven **prakriti** **udaya** results in the second **udaya** of eight **prakriti**, and the **anantaanubandhi** **krodha** (anger) etc.

## The Chapter of Sevenfold Arising

Understanding the three types of eightfold arising, which arise from the combination of one of the sevenfold arising with a third, is essential. Therefore, there are three sets of twenty-four bhangas (breaks). They are as follows:

The first set of twenty-four bhangas arises when the arising of fear is combined with the arising of the eightfold arising from the previously mentioned sevenfold arising. The second set of twenty-four bhangas arises when the arising of disgust is combined with the arising of the eightfold arising from the previously mentioned sevenfold arising. The third set of twenty-four bhangas arises when the arising of any one of the four infinite-binding passions (anger, pride, deceit, and greed) is combined with the arising of the eightfold arising from the previously mentioned sevenfold arising. Thus, there are three sets of twenty-four bhangas when the eightfold arising is present.

This chapter addresses the doubts regarding the non-acceptance of the four infinite-binding passions in the sevenfold arising and the eightfold arising obtained from the arising of fear and disgust, and the acceptance of the arising of the infinite-binding passions only after the binding-chain (bandhavali). The excerpt from the commentary by Acharya Malayagiri on these doubts is as follows:

"How is it possible that the arising of the infinite-binding passions is inevitable in the case of false belief (mithyatva)? How is it that false belief is mentioned here as being devoid of the arising of the infinite-binding passions in the sevenfold arising or the eightfold arising? It is said that in the case of a person with right belief (samyagdrishti), the infinite-binding passions are initially disconnected by some means. This person, being liberated, does not have the destruction of false belief. Due to the absence of such a general condition, when a person later falls into false belief, the false belief, being the root of the infinite-binding passions, binds them. Therefore, as long as the binding-chain does not cross the threshold, their arising does not occur. It occurs when the binding-chain crosses the threshold."

## Sixth Karma Granth

**Question:** While the four Anantanubandhis arise in the Mithyadrishti Jiva according to the rule, why are they not mentioned in the seven natural Udayasthanas and the eight natural Udayasthanas arising from fear or disgust?

**Solution:** A Samyagdristi Jiva who has disjoined the four Anantanubandhis, but has not destroyed Mithyatva etc. due to lack of material for Kshapana, attains Mithyatva after a long time. Therefore, he again destroys the four Anantanubandhis due to Mithyatva. Such a Jiva does not experience the arising of Anantanubandhis for one Avaliika period, but they arise according to the rule after the Avaliika has passed. Therefore, the Udayasthanas of the Mithyadrishti Jiva become devoid of the arising of Anantanubandhis. This is why the arising of Anantanubandhis is not mentioned in the seven natural Udayasthanas and the eight natural Udayasthanas arising from fear or disgust.

**Note:** The arising of any Karma occurs when the Abadihakal (period of non-obstruction) is destroyed. The minimum Abadihakal for the four Anantanubandhis is Antarmuhurta (one-seventh of a Muhurta). The maximum Abadihakal is four thousand years. The rest is explained as follows:

From the time of the beginning of the Bagh Avaliika, their existence continues for that duration. When destruction begins during their existence, their priority and their corresponding Avaliika, along with the remaining similar-natured Avaliika, become united and transform into a Padma-Prakriti form. After the Sankrama Avaliika has passed, the arising occurs. After the Bagh Avaliika has passed, the arising mentioned does not contradict. 

Page #134:
---------------------------
## The Chapter of Seven Tika

Thus, the excellent uninterrupted time is four thousand years. Therefore, is the Anantanubandhi possible only after the Bandhavali?

The Anantanubandhi comes into existence from the time of Bandha itself, and upon its existence, Patadgrahata arises in the present Bandha. Upon attaining Patadgrahata, the remaining similar nature Dalikas undergo a transition, which transforms into the Patadgraha nature. This arises after the Sankramavali. Therefore, the Anantanubandhi begins to arise after the Avali, so this statement does not contradict.

The meaning of this doubt resolution is that the Anantanubandhi is a Chatushk Visanyojana nature. Although Visanyojana is itself a Kshaya, the difference between Visanyojana and Kshaya is that upon Visanyojana, the Visanyojita nature can come into existence again in the future upon finding suitable material. However, the nature that has attained Kshaya does not come into existence again.

Existence occurs in two ways: through Bandha and through Sankrama. However, there is a mutual relationship between Bandha and Sankrama. At the time of Bandha of a particular entity, there is a Sankrama of another similar nature Dalika. Such a nature is called Patadgraha nature. Patadgraha nature means the nature that receives the incoming Karmadal. It is a rule that the Karmadal obtained through Sankrama arises after the Sankramavali. Therefore, there is no objection in accepting the Anantanubandhi's arising after one Avali.

Although there can be Apकर्षण within the uninterrupted time after the new Bandhavali, and if such a nature has arisen, then the un-imparted Karmadal can also be independent of the Udayasamaya. Therefore, the newly bound Karmadal...

## Sixth Karma Granth, Chapter 67

**67**

Even within the time frame of *Ababakal* (a specific time period), *Udiranodaya* (arising of karmic influences) can occur due to specific actions. There is no obstacle to this.

The seven natural *Udayasthanas* (places of arising) mentioned earlier, when combined with fear and aversion, or fear and *Anantanubandhi* (infinite attachment), or aversion and *Anantanubandhi*, result in nine natural *Udayasthanas* in three ways. In these three options, there are twenty-four *Bhangas* (breakdowns) for each of the previous *Udayasthanas*. Thus, in the nine natural *Udayasthanas*, there are three sets of twenty-four *Bhangas*.

**8**

When fear, aversion, and *Anantanubandhi* are combined together in the previously mentioned seven natural *Udayasthanas*, it results in ten natural *Udayasthanas*. Here too, there are twenty-four *Bhangas* as mentioned earlier.

Therefore, there are twenty-four *Bhangas* for the seven natural *Udayasthanas*, three for the eight natural *Udayasthanas*, three for the nine natural *Udayasthanas*, and twenty-four for the ten natural *Udayasthanas*. In total, there are eight sets of twenty-four *Bhangas* in twenty-two natural *Udayasthanas* - *Sarvansankhya Dvaavinshati Bandhe Ashtau Chaturvinshatayah* (Total twenty-two *Bandhas* have eight sets of twenty-four).

**T**

After describing the *Udayasthanas* in twenty-two natural *Bandhas* (karmic bonds), we now explain the *Udayasthanas* in twenty-one natural *Bandhas*: *Nav Ekkavi Sattai Udaythanai* - meaning, in twenty-one natural *Bandhas*, there are seven, eight, and nine natural *Udayasthanas*. They are as follows:

In these twenty-one natural *Bandhas*, the arising of seven natural *Udayasthanas* occurs regularly, consisting of:

* One type of the four *Kshayas* (passions) - *Anantanubandhi*, *Apratyaakhyanavaran* (non-rejection covering), *Pratyaakhyanavaran* (rejection covering), and *Sanjwalan* (agitation).
* One out of the three *Vedas* (knowledge).
* One out of the two *Yugalas* (pairs).

This continues...

## Chapter 70

A total of twenty-four **bhangas** are obtained for the seven **prakritik** **udayasthanas**. When fear or disgust is added to these seven **prakritik** **udayasthanas**, eight **prakritik** **udayasthanas** are obtained in two ways. Thus, there are two options for the eight **prakritik** **udayasthanas**. In one option, there are twenty-four **bhangas**, and in the other option, there are twenty-four **bhangas**. Therefore, there are two sets of twenty-four **bhangas** for the eight **prakritik** **udayasthanas**. The ninth **prakritik** **udayasthanas** is obtained by combining fear and disgust simultaneously with the aforementioned seven **prakritik** **udayasthanas**. Since this is of a single type, it has twenty-four **bhangas**.

Thus, in the twenty-one **prakritik** **bandhasthanas**, there are twenty-four **bhangas** for the seven **prakritik** **udayasthanas**, forty-eight **bhangas** for the eight **prakritik** **udayasthanas**, and twenty-four **bhangas** for the ninth **prakritik** **udayasthanas**, totaling one hundred and twenty **bhangas**.

These twenty-one **prakritik** **bandhasthanas** are only for the **sasadan** **samyagdristi** **jiva**, and there are two types of **sasadan** **samyagdristi**: **shreṇigat** and **ashreṇigat**. A **jiva** who falls from the **upsham** **guna** **sthana** and attains the **sasadan** **guna** **sthana** is called a **shreṇigat** **sasadan** **samyagdristi**. And a **jiva** who does not ascend the **upsham** **shreṇi** but attains the **sasadan** state due to the arising of **anantaanubandhi** is called an **ashreṇigat** **sasadan** **samyagdristi**. Here, the seven, eight, and nine **prakritik** **udayasthanas** mentioned in the twenty-one **prakritik** **bandhasthanas** should be understood in relation to the **ashreṇigat** **sasadan** **samyagdristi** **jiva**.

1. This **pavishtabandha** is attained in **sasadan**. **Sasadan** is of two types: **shreṇigat** and **ashreṇigat**. Having attained **shreṇigat** **sasadan**, one must go through these seven and other **udayasthanas**.

## Sixth Karma Granth, Chapter 16

There are two opinions regarding the **Sāsādan Samyakdr̥ṣṭi** (perfectly-sighted being) who belongs to the **Śreṇi** (category). Some Ācāryas believe that even a being with **Anantānubandhi** (infinite karmic bonds) can attain **Upasamaṇi** (state of liberation). However, according to the **Āmārga** (non-Jain) view, even those with Anantānubandhi can attain Upasamaṇi. This is supported by the following verse:

**"Aṇadansan'asitpīveyachakkaṁ ca purisāveyam ca."**

This means that first, the Anantānubandhi **Kṣaya** (passion) is subdued. Then, **Darśana Mohaniya** (delusion of perception) is subdued. After that, **Napumsaka Veda** (masculine knowledge), **Strī Veda** (feminine knowledge), **Six Nokṣaya** (six types of passions), and **Puruṣa Veda** (masculine knowledge) are subdued in order.

Such a being can fall from the Śreṇi and attain the **Sāsādan** state. Therefore, it also has the three **Udayasthāna** (stages of existence) mentioned earlier.

However, other Ācāryas believe that only a being who has completely **Vinsayojana** (disconnected) from Anantānubandhi can attain the **Upasama Śreṇi** (category of liberation). According to them, such a being cannot fall from the Upasama Śreṇi and attain the Sāsādan state because the Anantānubandhi cannot arise in them, and the **Sāsādan Samyaktv** (perfect knowledge) ...

... - 1 (a) Some say that even a being with Anantānubandhi karmic bonds can attain Upasamaṇi. According to them, even those with Anantānubandhi can attain liberation.

**Sapttatikā Prakaraṇa Ṭīkā, p. 166** (b) The Digambara tradition does not mention the opinion of Anantānubandhi attaining liberation in the **Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama**, **Kṣayapramṛta**, and their commentaries. However, it is mentioned in the **Go. Karmakāṇḍa**. There, it is stated that there are 28, 24, and 21 **Prakṛtika** (natural) **Sattāsthāna** (states of existence) in the Upasama Śreṇi.

## Chapter 70

**Gain is achieved only through the arising of the infinite bonds, not otherwise.** It is also said: "Without the arising of the infinite bonds, the attainment of the state of Saasadan Samyaktv is not possible."

**The inquirer asks:**

"Is it not appropriate to assume that when a being is facing falsehood but has not attained falsehood, then according to those teachers, the attainment of the Saasadan Gunasthan would occur even without the arising of their infinite bonds? If this is the case, then their six-natured, seven-natured, eight-natured, and nine-natured states would be attained. But this is not the case, because it is not mentioned in the Agamas, and those teachers do not believe it. Therefore, it is clear that the attainment of Saasadan Samyaktv does not occur without the arising of the infinite bonds."

**Solution:**

This assumption is not correct, because if it were true, then the being would attain the four states of six-natured, seven-natured, eight-natured, and nine-natured. However, this is not mentioned in the Agamas, and those teachers do not believe it. This proves that the attainment of Saasadan Samyaktv does not occur without the arising of the infinite bonds.

"The being who, by disconnecting the infinite bonds, clings to the state of Upshamni, does not attain the Saasadan Gunasthan." This statement is made according to the commentary of Acharya Malayagiri. However, based on the lower evidence of Karma-prakriti, etc., it is known that such a being does attain the Saasadan Gunasthan. As it is written in the Purna of Karma-prakriti:

"The being who is a true monk, who has a desire for liberation, and who is firmly established in the right path, will not be bound by the infinite bonds." (Commentary on Chapter 70, page 166)

## Sixth Karma Granth

**The text states that the one who is a bad, Samyagdristi, Jiva, and who makes comparisons with the Mohaniya, detaches from the fourfold An-Chatushk through the Niyama. Due to this, the detachment from the infinite Ananta-Anubandhas of the Virat Jivas is said to occur. Further, in the same source, it is written:**

**"Asaag va vi gacchenna"**

**Meaning:** Such a Jiva descends from the Upshama Shreni and attains the Sasadan Gunasthan.

**From the above mentioned texts, it is known that the Karma-Prakriti's opinion is that it is not possible to ascend the Upshama Shreni without detaching from the Ananta-Anubandhis, and the Jiva who descends from there also attains the Sasadan Gunasthan.**

**The Upshama-na Prakaran of the Pancha-Sangrah also supports the opinion of the Karma-Prakriti. However, its Sankrama-Prakaran does not support this. There, it is stated that only 21 out of 25 transmigrate to the Sasadan Gunasthan.**

**While there are 17 Prakruti Bandha-sthans, the "Chhai Nay Sattaar Se" - this:**

1. **Karma-Prakriti Shruti Upshama Gatha 30**
2. **Karma-Prakriti Upshama Gatha 62**
3. **In the Digambar Sampradaya, there are traditions of Shatkhandagam and Kashya-Prabhut. According to the tradition of Shatkhandagam, a Jiva who falls from the Upshama-ni does not attain the Sasadan Gunasthan.

## The Chapter of the Sevenfold

There are four stages of arising: the sevenfold, the eightfold, the ninefold, and the tenfold.

The seventeenfold bondage stage occurs in the third mixed and fourth uninterrupted right-faith stages. Of these, the mixed stage has three stages of arising: the sevenfold, the eightfold, and the ninefold.

**102**

In the sevenfold stage of arising, excluding the infinite-bond, one of the fourfold passions of anger, etc., one of the three Vedas, one of the two pairs, and right-wrong faith arise in a regular manner. Here too, as before, there are twenty-four types of breaks. In this sevenfold stage of arising, the addition of fear or disgust results in the eightfold stage of arising. This stage is of two types...

However, according to the tradition of the passion-purification, a being who has ascended to the stage of pacification can also fall from it and attain the stage of the subtle. However, in the powder of passion-purification, the infinite-bond pacification nature is prohibited. Along with this, it is also written that a being with right-faith knowledge does not pacify the passions without disintegrating the fourfold infinite-bond. This opinion is also supported by the original passion-purification.

**The Seventeenfold Bondage in Two**

1. Right-wrong faith and uninterrupted right-faith are the two. Of these, there are three stages of arising in right-wrong faith, namely: the sevenfold, the eightfold, and the ninefold. - Commentary on the Chapter of the Sevenfold, page 166

2. There, the infinite-bond, one of the three anger, etc., one of the three Vedas, one of the two pairs, and right-wrong faith, these seven natures arise regularly in right-wrong faith. - Commentary on the Chapter of the Sevenfold, page 166

## Sixth Karma Granth

Therefore, two Chaubisi are obtained here. By combining fear and disgust in the aforementioned seven natural उदयस्थान, nine natural उदयस्थान are obtained. Since there is no alternative here, one Chaubisi is obtained. Thus, in the mixed गुणस्थान, with seventeen natural बंधस्थान, one Chaubisi of भंग in the seven natural उदयस्थान, two Chaubisi of भंग in the eight natural उदयस्थान, and one Chaubisi of भंग in the nine natural उदयस्थान, a total of four Chaubisi are obtained.

After explaining the alternatives of उदयस्थान in the seventeen natural बंध in the mixed गुणस्थान, now we explain the उदयस्थान in the fourth गुणस्थान. In the fourth अविरत सम्बष्टि गुणस्थान, with seventeen natural बंध, there are six natural, वात प्रकृतिक, आर प्रकृतिक, and nine natural, these four उदयस्थान. One should know that in the अविरत सम्यग्दृष्टि गुणस्थान, the definite उदय of any one कषाय from the fourfold of कोषादि, any one वेद from the three वेद, and any one युगल from the two युगल, of the three कषाय types excluding अनन्तानुबंधी, results in six natural उदयस्थान. There is one Chaubisi of भंग in this.

By adding fear or disgust or सम्यक्त्वमोहनीय to this six natural उदयस्थान, seven natural उदयस्थान are obtained in three ways. There is one Chaubisi in each of these distinctions, therefore, three Chaubisi of भंग are obtained in the seven natural उदयस्थान.

The eight natural उदयस्थान are obtained by adding fear and disgust or fear and सम्यक्त्वमोहनीय or disgust... 

Page #142:
---------------------------
## Chapter 104: The Sevenfold

Combining the two natures of **Samyaktvamohaniya** and **Avirat Samyagdristi** results in a **sevenfold** nature. This sevenfold nature can be attained in three ways, leading to twenty-four **bhangas** (breakdowns) for each variation. This results in three sets of twenty-four **bhangas** for the eightfold nature.

Combining the three natures of **bhaya** (fear), **jagapsa** (desire), and **Samyaktvamohaniya** within the sixfold nature results in a **ninefold** nature. This ninefold nature lacks **yivarupa** (form), leading to a single set of twenty-four **bhangas**.

Therefore, in the fourth **Avirat Samyagdristi** **gunasthan** (stage of virtue), there are seventeen **bandhastan** (bondage states) with sixfold nature resulting in one set of twenty-four **bhangas**, sevenfold nature resulting in three sets of twenty-four **bhangas**, eightfold nature resulting in three sets of twenty-four **bhangas**, and ninefold nature resulting in one set of twenty-four **bhangas**. This totals eight sets of twenty-four **bhangas**. Out of these, four sets are without the **Samyaktvamohaniya** nature, and four sets are with the **Samyaktvamohaniya** nature.

The four sets without the **Samyaktvamohaniya** nature are to be known by **Upshama Samyagdristi** (subdued omniscient) and **Kshayik Samyagdristi** (decaying omniscient) beings. The four sets with the **Samyaktvamohaniya** nature are to be known by **Vedak Samyagdristi** (knowing omniscient) beings.

Now, we will explain the alternatives for the **udayasthan** (liberation states) of the thirteen **bandhastan** (bondage states). These are: "**Tere Panchaai Athev**" - with thirteen **bandhastan**, there are four **udayasthan**: fivefold, sixfold, sevenfold, and eightfold.

The first, fivefold **udayasthan**, is as follows: **pratyakhyanavaran** (denial-covering), **sanjwalan** (agitation) types of **krodhadi kshaya chatushk** (fourfold passions of anger, etc.), one passion from each of the three **vedas** (knowledge), 

Page #143:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karma Granth, Chapter 105

In any one of the two pairs of Vedas, these five natures are always arising! This place does not occur in Mrināla. It has one BBC of bhangas. By combining one of the three natures - fear, disgust, or right faith delusion - with the five-natured arising place, a six-natured arising place is obtained. Due to this place occurring in three ways, there are three Chaubīsīs. 

Further, by combining two natures - fear and disgust, fear and right faith delusion, or disgust and right faith delusion - with the five-natured arising place, a seven-natured arising place is obtained. Due to this arising place being obtained in three ways, three Chaubīsīs are obtained. An eight-natured arising place is obtained by combining fear, disgust, and right faith delusion simultaneously with the five-natured arising place. Since there is no alternative in this place, there is one Chaubīsī of bhangas here.

Thus, in the fifth Gunasthan, with thirteen-natured bondage places, there are a total of eight Chaubīsīs of bhangas, with one, three, three, and one in relation to the arising places. Of these, four Chaubīsīs belong to the Upshama Samyagdristi and Kshayika Samyagdristi beings, and four Chaubīsīs belong to the Vedaka Samyagdristi beings. The Vedaka Samyagdristi have four Chaubīsīs with the arising of right faith delusion.

So far, we have discussed the arising places in twenty-two, twenty-one, seventeen, and thirteen-natured bondage places. Now, we will explain the arising places in the nine-natured and other bondage places.

"Chattarima Navabantragesu Ukkosa Sattam Udhayamsa" - meaning, in the nine-natured bondage place, the arising places are from four to seven. That is, in the nine-natured bondage place, there are four-natured, five-natured, six-natured... 

Page #144:
---------------------------
## Chapter 106: The Seven-Natured State

There are four types of arising states: three-natured, four-natured, five-natured, and seven-natured. These arise in the sixth, seventh, and eighth stages of the soul.

The four-natured arising state is characterized by the following: one of the four passions (anger, pride, deceit, and greed), one of the three Vedas (knowledge, conduct, and faith), one of the two pairs (knowledge and conduct, faith and conduct), and one of the four natures (fear, aversion, delusion, and right faith). This four-natured state arises in the sixth and subsequent stages of the soul for both temporary and permanent omniscients. Since there is no choice involved, there is one twenty-fourfold classification.

By adding one of the three natures (fear, aversion, or delusion) to the four-natured state, we get the five-natured arising state. There are three choices here, and since each choice has twenty-fourfold classifications, there are a total of three twenty-fourfold classifications.

By combining two of the four natures (fear and aversion, fear and delusion, or aversion and delusion) in the four-natured state, we get the six-natured arising state. There are three choices here, and since each choice has twenty-fourfold classifications, there are a total of three twenty-fourfold classifications.

By combining all three natures (fear, aversion, and delusion) in the four-natured state, we get the seven-natured arising state. This state is unique, so there is only one twenty-fourfold classification.

Therefore, in the nine-natured state of bondage, there are a total of eight twenty-fourfold classifications: one for the four-natured state, three for the five-natured state, three for the six-natured state, and one for the seven-natured state. 

Page #145:
---------------------------
## The Karma Granth (Chapter 107)

There are 24 types of **Upasham Samyagdrishti** and **Kshayik Samyagdrishti** Jivas, and 4 types of **Vedak Samyagdrishti** Jivas.

In the five natural **Bandhastanas**, there is an **Udayasthan** of two natures: one from the five **Sanjwalanas** (anger, pride, deceit, and greed) and one from the three **Vedas**. This is stated as "**Panchvibandhage Pun Udo Doham**". In this place, there are twelve **Bhangas** formed by multiplying the four **Kshayas** with the three **Vedas**. These twelve **Bhangas** occur in the first part of the ninth **Gunasthan**.

After the five natural **Bandhastanas**, there are four, three, two, and one natural **Bandhastanas**, each having an **Udayasthan** of one nature. This means that each of these **Udayasthanas** has the rise of one nature. This is explained as "**Itti Chaubandhai Ikkekkudiya Havanti Samve Vi**".

In the five natural **Bandhastanas**, the **Bandhavichched** and **Udayavichched** of the **Purushaveda** occur simultaneously. Therefore, during the four natural **Bandhas**, the rise of one nature from the four **Sanjwalanas** occurs. This results in four **Bhangas**. This is because a Jiva ascends the **Shreni** due to the rise of anger, another due to the rise of pride, another due to the rise of deceit, and another due to the rise of greed. Thus, there are four **Bhangas**.

Some **Acharyas** believe that during the transition of the twelve natural **Bandhas**, the rise of one **Veda** from the three **Vedas** occurs. Therefore, according to them, in the first period of the four natural **Bandhas**, there is a rise of two natures. This results in twelve **Bhangas** by multiplying the four **Kshayas** with the three **Vedas**. 

Page #146:
---------------------------
## The Sapttatika Chapter

There are twelve bhangas (breaks) when performing (the ritual). This is also confirmed in the original commentary of the Panchasangraha:

"In the section on the destruction of the six passions, some Acharyas believe that the emergence of one of the three Vedas occurs in the first part of the beings who bind four natures. Therefore, you should know that there are twelve bhangas for the beings who bind four natures, due to the emergence of two natures."

Thus, according to the opinion of those Acharyas, there are twenty-four bhangas in the emergence of two natures. Twelve bhangas are at the time of the five-natured bondage, and twelve bhangas are at the time of the four-natured bondage.

When the bondage of the burning anger is broken, there is a three-natured bondage and a one-natured emergence. Here, there are three bhangas. However, the special feature here is that one should say that the emergence of one of the remaining three natures, excluding the burning anger, occurs. Because, in the emergence of burning anger, the bondage of burning anger is definitely present. It is also said: "Ya te bandhai" - the being who experiences pain, definitely binds that.

Therefore, when the bondage of burning anger is broken, its emergence is also broken. Therefore, at the time of the three-natured bondage:

1. "They desire the emergence of one of the three Vedas at the time of the transition from the three-natured bondage. Therefore, according to their opinion, there are twelve bhangas of emergence in the first part of the beings who bind two natures."

- Sapttatika Chapter Commentary, Page 168 

Page #147:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karma Granth, Verse 106

It should be said that the emergence of any one of the three natures, namely, Sanjwalan, Mana, and Maya, occurs. 

When the bondage of Sanjwalan Mana is broken, there is a bondage of two natures and an emergence of one nature. However, that emergence is of one of Sanjwalan Maya or Lobha, therefore, two breaks are obtained here. 

When the bondage of Sanjwalan Maya is broken, there is a bondage of Sanjwalan Lobha and its emergence. This is a bondage of one nature and a place of emergence. Therefore, there is one break here. 

Although the emergence of Sanjwalan Krodha, etc., occurs in the four places of bondage, etc., of four natures, therefore, no special distinction arises in the breaks, yet due to the difference in the places of bondage, they have been stated separately, considering them as different.

Similarly, in the absence of bondage, in the subtle Sampraya Gunasthan, the emergence of one nature of Mohaniya Karma should be understood - 'Bandhovareme Vi Taha', therefore, this is one break. 

Thus, in the four places of bondage, etc., of four natures, the total breaks are 4+3+3+1+1=11.

Subsequently, at the end of the subtle Sampraya Gunasthan, when the emergence and breaking of Mohlliya occurs, its essence is found in the Upshanta Moha Gunasthan. Here, the consideration of the mutual connection of the places of bondage and emergence is being done, due to which there was no need to mention the place of essence in the verse, yet it has been indicated here in passing - 'Udayabhave Vi Va Hojja' - the existence of Mohaniya Karma is due to choice!

Now, in the following verse, the breaks that are possible in the places of emergence from ten to one are indicated.

**Verse 18**
One, six, eleven, ten, seven, four, one, these are twenty-four, twenty-four, two, eleven.

**Word Meaning:**
One, six, eleven, ten, seven, four, one, these, twenty-four, twenty-four, two, eleven.

**Meaning:**
In the ten natural and other places of origin, there are twenty-four variations, with one, six, eleven, ten, seven, four, and one. In the two natural places of origin, there are twenty-four, and in the one natural place of origin, there are eleven variations.

**Special Meaning:**
The verse states the number of twenty-four variations in each of the ten natural and other places of origin. Although the number of variations in each of the first ten natural and other places of origin has been mentioned earlier, their total number is mentioned here to show the total number of variations in all the places of origin of the mohaniya karma and the number of individual variations. The twenty-four variations mentioned in the verse should be adjusted according to the number of places of origin. For example, there is one twenty-four in the place of origin of ten, six twenty-fours in the place of origin of nine, and so on. This is explained below.

There is one twenty-four in the ten natural places of origin, "Ekkag". This is because there are no variations in the nature of the ten natural places of origin. Therefore, one twenty-four is mentioned.

**Nine Natural Arising Places**

There are a total of six **Chaubisi** (sets of 24) of **Bhang** (breakdowns) in the nine natural arising places. They are as follows:

* In the twenty-two natural binding places, there are three **Chaubisi** in the nine natural arising places.
* In the twenty-one natural binding places, there is one **Chaubisi** in the nine natural arising places.
* In the **Mishra Guna** (mixed quality) place, there is one **Chaubisi** in the seventeen natural binding places.
* In the fourth quality place, there is one **Chaubisi** in the seventeen natural binding places.

Thus, there are a total of six **Chaubisi** of **Bhang** in the nine natural arising places.

**Eight Natural Arising Places**

There are a total of eleven **Chaubisi** of **Bhang** in the eight natural arising places, known as **Ikkaral**. They are as follows:

* In the twenty-two natural binding places, there are three **Chaubisi** in the eight natural arising places.
* In the twenty-one natural binding places, there are two **Chaubisi** in the eight natural arising places.
* In the **Mishra Guna** place, there are two **Chaubisi** in the seventeen natural binding places.
* In the fourth quality place, there are three **Chaubisi** in the seventeen natural binding places.
* In the fifth quality place, there is one **Chaubisi** in the thirteen natural binding places.

Thus, there are a total of eleven **Chaubisi** of **Bhang** in the eight natural arising places.

**Seven Natural Arising Places**

There are a total of ten **Chaubisi** of **Bhang** in the seven natural arising places. They are as follows:

* In the twenty-two natural binding places, there is one **Chaubisi** in the seven natural arising places.
* In the twenty-one natural binding places, there is one **Chaubisi** in the seven natural arising places.
* In the **Mishra Guna** place, there is one **Chaubisi** in the seventeen natural binding places.
* In the fourth quality place, there is one **Chaubisi** in the seventeen natural binding places.

## Chapter 72

**P**

There are seventeen natural *bandha sthana* in the *sthana*.  There are three *chaubisi* of the seven natural *udaya sthana* limbs in the *sthana* with seventeen natural *bandha sthana*. There are three *chaubisi* of the seven natural *udaya sthana* destructions in the *sthana* with thirteen natural *bandha sthana*. There is one *chaubisi* of the seven natural *udaya sthana* destructions in the *sthana* with nine natural *bandha sthana*. Thus, there are a total of ten *chaubisi* of destructions in the seven natural *udaya sthana*.

There are a total of seven *chaubisi* of destructions in the six natural *udaya sthana*. They are as follows: There is one *chaubisi* of the six natural *udaya sthana* destructions in the *sthana* with seventeen natural *bandha sthana* during the time of uninterrupted *samyagdrishti*. There are three *chaubisi* each of the six natural *udaya sthana* limbs in the *sthana* with thirteen natural *bandha sthana* and nine natural *bandha sthana*. Thus, there are a total of seven *chaubisi* of destructions in the natural *udaya sthana*.

There are a total of four *chaubisi* of destructions in the five natural *udaya sthana*. They are as follows: There is one *chaubisi* of the five natural *udaya sthana* destructions in the *sthana* with thirteen natural *bandha sthana*. There are a total of three *chaubisi* of the five natural *udaya sthana* destructions in the *sthana* with nine natural *bandha sthana*. Thus, there are a total of four *chaubisi* of destructions in the five natural *udaya sthana*.

There is one *chaubisi* of the four natural *udaya* destructions in the *sthana* with nine natural *bandha sthana*.

Thus, the total number of *chaubisi* of destructions from ten to four *udaya sthana* is 1+6+11+10+...+4+1 = 40 *chaubisi*.

There are twelve destructions of the two natural *udaya* in the *sthana* with five natural *bandha*. There are also two natural *udaya* possible in the *sthana* with four natural *bandha*, according to some *acharyas*. Thus, there are twelve destructions of the two natural *udaya sthana*. This makes one *chaubisi* of destructions in the two natural *udaya sthana*.

The sixth karmagrantha, Chaubisi, consists of four, three, two, and one natural bandha sthana, and at the time of abandha, one natural udaya sthana, respectively, with four, three, two, and one gangore. Their total number is eleven. Therefore, there are a total of eleven bhangas for one natural udaya sthana. Thus, the verse explains the chaubisi and the individual bhangas in all the udaya sthanas of mohaniya karma.

The fourth verse of this gatha is described in two ways in the tab of the sixth karmagrantha called Saptathika. According to the svamata, it is described as "char gikimi iskara" and according to the matantara, it is described as "babbis kugiskamikara". According to the first reading, according to the svamata, there are twelve bhangas in two natural udaya sthana, and according to the second reading, according to the matantara, there are twenty-four bhangas in two natural udaya sthana. Acharya Malayagiri has confirmed this meaning in his tika as follows:
"Dwikodaye 'chaturvishatireka bhangakanaam, etasch matantarenoktam, anyatha svamate praavasesha bhangaa bevitaamyaah."
That is, there are twenty-four bhangas in two natural udaya sthana. This statement is made according to the opinion of other acharyas. According to the svamata, there are only twelve bhangas in two natural udaya sthana.

Here, in gatha 16, two natural udaya sthana are mentioned at the time of five natural bandha sthana, and in gatha 17, one natural udaya sthana is mentioned at the time of four natural bandha sthana. This confirms the indication of twelve bhangas according to the svamata and twenty-four bhangas according to the matantara. These differences of opinion are also mentioned in the Panchasangraha Saptathika prakarana and Go. Karmakanda.

The details of the valid bhangas of bandha sthana and udaya sthana should be known as follows.

―
**Word Meaning:** Nine hundred forty-nine *udayavikalpas* (arising conditions), nine hundred seventy-one *padavrindas* (groups of words), bewildered by *unamvigahudayavikalpas* (arising conditions of non-attachment), *jivajiva* (living beings), *aunsariegu* (unclear).

**Meaning:** With these groups of words, one should know that there are ninety-seven thousand one hundred and seventy-one *vishelayas* (analyses).

**Verse:** All worldly beings should be known to be bewildered by nine hundred forty-nine *udayavikalpas* and ninety-seven thousand one hundred and seventy-one *padavrindas*.

**Special Meaning:** Previously, the breaking of the *udayasthanas* (arising places) of *mohaniya karma* (karma that causes delusion) and the extent of their parts was explained. Now, in this verse, their total number and their *padavrindas* are being clarified.

Each *chaubisi* (twenty-four) has twenty-four *bhangas* (breakings). The total number of *chaubisis* of *udayasthanas* mentioned earlier is forty-one. Therefore, multiplying forty-one by twenty-four, the total number obtained is nine hundred eighty-four - 41 x 24 = 984. This number does not include the *bhangas* of one natural *udayasthan*. Those *bhangas* are eleven. Therefore, adding those eleven *bhangas*, the total number of *bhangas* becomes nine hundred forty-nine. Out of these *bhangas*, the arising of at least one *bhang* occurs for beings up to the tenth *gunasthan* (stage of spiritual development). The reason for considering only beings up to the tenth *gunasthan* is that the arising of *mohaniya karma* is found only up to that point. Although the being residing in the eleventh *gunasthan* (stage of spiritual development), *upshantamoha* (completely pacified delusion), experiences the arising of *mohaniya karma* when it falls from its own place, but due to the arising of *mohaniya karma* for a minimum of one moment and a maximum of *antarmuhurt* (a period of time between two *muhurtas*), it is not considered, and only beings up to the tenth *gunasthan* are considered.

## The Chapter of the Seven Tika

It is said that out of the aforementioned 995 bhangas, one is attracted to at least one bhang, if not more. The false nature of mohaniya karma, the infinite anubandhi kadha, the non-rejectable avarna krodha, the rejectable avarna krodha, etc., each nature is called a pad, and their collective name is padavrind. This is also called prakriti vikalp. In other words, all the prakritis that are taken into account in the ten prakriti udaysthanas are called pads, and the bhangas that arise from their differences are called padavrind or prakriti vikalp. Here, their total number of differences is stated as 6971. The explanation is as follows:

The ten prakriti udaysthan is one, therefore it has ten prakritis. The nine prakriti udaysthan are six, therefore they have 64654 prakritis. The eight prakriti udaysthan are eleven, therefore they have 88 prakritis. The seven prakriti udaysthan are ten, therefore they have 70 prakritis. The six prakriti udaysthan are seven, therefore they have 42 prakritis. The five prakriti udaysthan are four, therefore they have 20 prakritis. The four prakriti udaysthan is one, therefore it has four prakritis. The two prakriti udaysthan is one, therefore it has two prakritis. Adding all these prakritis together, 10 + 54 + 88 + 70 + 42 + 20 + 4 + 2 = 290.

From these 290 prakritis, each has 24 bhangas. Therefore, multiplying 290 by 24, we get 6960. This number does not include the eleven bhangas of the one prakriti udaysthan. Therefore, adding those eleven bhangas, the total number becomes 6971. Here, it is important to know that the four...

---------------------------
## Sixth Karma Granth, Chapter 117

During the transition period of the four karmic bonds, twelve variations were mentioned for the two-natured arising places. By including these, the total number of arising places and positions is explained. 

This means that if the twelve variations from the alternative view are removed from the arising places, there are 683 arising options. And if the twelve variations of the two-natured arising places are removed, the total number of positions is 6647. 

Further clarification will be provided in the following verse. Now, the number of arising places and positions, excluding the twelve variations, is being indicated.

**Verse 20:**

"The living beings are deluded by the 983 arising options and the 747 groups of positions."

**Explanation of the Verse:**

It should be understood that worldly beings are deluded by 983 arising options and 747 groups of positions.

**Special Meaning:**

The previous verse mentioned the number of arising options and groups of positions based on the alternative view. This verse clarifies the number of arising options and groups of positions based on the main view.

The previous verse mentioned 665 arising options and 6671 groups of positions. This verse mentions 153 arising options and 6947 groups of positions. The reason for this difference is that during the transition of the four karmic bonds, there is a two-natured arising place. If this alternative view is not considered as the main view, and according to their view, the arising options and...

## Saptalika Prakarana 118

If we exclude the Padavrandas, the number of Mohaniya Karma Udayavikalpas are 683 and 6647 respectively.

Here, the Mohaniya Karma Udayavikalpas are explained in two ways: one with 665 and the other with 683. In the 665 Udayavikalpas, 24 Bhangas are taken for two Prakritik Udayasthanas, and in the 683 Udayavikalpas, 12 Bhangas are taken for two Prakritik Udayasthanas. These Udayavikalpas are also mentioned in the Panchasangraha Saptalika, but there they are explained in three ways. In the first way, there is a slight difference from the 665 mentioned here, and in the second way, there is a difference from the 683 mentioned here. The reason for this is that here, 11 Bhangas are taken for one Prakritik Uday's Bandhabandha, while in the Panchasangraha Saptalika, they are taken from the Prakritik Veda, which reduces the total number of Udayavikalpas to 676 by subtracting 7 from 8. In the third way, while counting the Udayavikalpas, their number is increased to 1265 due to the Gunasthanabheda.

The number of these is also mentioned in the Karmakanda. But there, they are divided into two categories: Punarukta Bhang and Apunarukta Bhang. The Punarukta Bhang are counted as 1283. Out of these, 1265 are the same as those counted in the Panchasangraha Saptalika, and 12 more Bhangas are taken for two Prakritik Udayas in the four Prakritik Sangha. Also, the five Bhangas taken for one Prakritik Uday in the Panchasangraha Saptalika are increased to 11 here. In this way, the number in the Karmakanda becomes 1283 due to the increase of 18 Bhangas from the Panchasangraha Saptalika. And in the Karmakanda, the Apunarukta Bhang are counted as 677. So, one Bhang is added due to the Gunasthanabheda of one Prakritik Uday, which increases the number of Bhangas from 976 to 977.

Similarly, here, the Padavrandas of Mohaniya are explained in two ways: 

Page #157:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karmagrantha, Chapter 119

**6971 and 6947:** When two natural states arise for some time during the four natural states of bondage, there are 6671 padavrindas if this view is accepted and 6947 padavrindas if this view is rejected. These two numbers are mentioned in the Panchasangraha Saptathika. However, in addition to these, four types of padavrindas are also mentioned. The first type is 6640, in which, due to the difference in bandhabandha, instead of 11 bhangas of one natural state, a total of 4 bhangas are taken. Thus, 7 bhangas are reduced from 6947, resulting in the number 6640. The remaining three types of padavrindas are mentioned due to the difference in gunasthanas, which are 84778483 and 8507 respectively.

In the Go. Karmakanda, padavrindas are called prakritivikalpas. Like udayavikalpas, these prakritivikalpas are also of two types: punarukta and apunarukta. Their number is 8507 in comparison to punarukta udayavikalpas and 6941 in comparison to apunarukta udayavikalpas. The 6640 padavrindas mentioned in the Panchasangraha Saptathika become 6941 prakritivikalpas when one bhang is added due to the difference in gunasthanas. This is because in the Panchasangraha Saptathika, a total of four bhangas of one natural state are taken, while in the Karmakanda, five are taken due to the difference in gunasthanas. This increases the number of bhangas by one.

The difference in numbers mentioned above is due to the difference in interpretation (vivkshaabheda), not due to the difference in belief (manyaabheda).

In this way, for information about the udayasthanas, their vikalpas and prakritivikalpas of mohaniya karma, according to one's own view and the views of others, and according to other karmagranthas, see Go. Karmakanda, verses 475 to 456.

---------------------------
## Chapter of the Sevenfold Text (Sapttatika Prakarana)
120

Having explained the destruction of the Udayavikalpas and Prakritivikalpas through the various opinions, we now discuss the time duration of the Udayasthanas.

The lowest duration of the ten Udayasthanas and their destructions is one Samaya, and the highest duration is Antarmuhurta.

From the fourth Prakritik Udayastana to the tenth Prakritik Udayastana, the emergence of one Veda and one Yugal occurs in each Udayastana. The Veda and Yugal inevitably change within one Muhurta. This is also explained in the original commentary of the Panchasagraha:

"Ovem Yugalen Va Avashyam Muhurtabaras: Paravartitavyaam."

This means that the change of one Veda and one Yugal occurs within one Muhurta.

This confirms that the highest duration of these four Prakritik Udayasthanas and their destructions, which is stated as Antarmuhurta, is correct. The second and first Prakritik Udayasthanas also exist for a maximum duration of Antarmuhurta. Therefore, their highest duration is also Antarmuhurta.

The lowest duration of all these Udayasthanas is one Samaya. This should be understood as follows: When a being resides in a particular Udayastana or its specific destruction for one Samaya and then dies or undergoes a change to another Gunastana, there is a difference in its Gunastana. The Bandhastana also changes, and according to the Gunastana, there is also a difference in its Udayastana and its destructions. Therefore, the lowest duration of all Udayasthanas and their destructions is one Samaya.

## Chapter 72

After describing the types of *bhangas* (breakages), we now describe the *satta-sthana* (places of existence) along with the *bandha-sthana* (places of bondage).

There are **twenty-two** *bandha-sthana* with **three** *satta-sthana*, **twenty-one** *bandha-sthana* with **twenty-eight** *satta-sthana*, **eighteen** *bandha-sthana* with **six** *satta-sthana*, **seventeen** *bandha-sthana* with **six** *satta-sthana*, **thirteen** and **nine** *bandha-sthana* with **five** *satta-sthana* each.

In **five** *bandha-sthana*, there are **six** *satta-sthana* each, in **four** *bandha-sthana*, there are **six** *satta-sthana* each, and in the remaining *bandha-sthana*, there are **five** *satta-sthana* each. Know that even after the *bandha* (bondage) is broken, there are **four** *satta-sthana*.

**In summary:**

* There are three *satta-sthana* in twenty-two *bandha-sthana*.
* There are twenty-eight *satta-sthana* in twenty-one *bandha-sthana*.
* There are six *satta-sthana* in eighteen *bandha-sthana*.
* There are six *satta-sthana* in seventeen *bandha-sthana*.
* There are five *satta-sthana* each in thirteen and nine *bandha-sthana*.
* There are six *satta-sthana* each in five and four *bandha-sthana*.
* There are five *satta-sthana* each in the remaining *bandha-sthana*.
* There are four *satta-sthana* after the *bandha* is broken.

**Note:** In the previous verses (15, 16, and 17), we discussed the relationship between the *bandha-sthana* and *udaya-sthana* (places of arising) of *mohaniya karma* (karma that causes delusion).

## Sixth Karma Granth 
### 123

Here, in two verses, the mutual connection between the bondage places and the existence places of Mohaniya Karma is explained.  Also, since it is necessary to state the mutual connection between the bondage places, the arising places and the existence places, we will mention the arising places that are obtained while explaining the mutual connection between the bondage places and the existence places.

There are ten natural bondage places of Mohaniya Karma: twenty-two, twenty-one, seventeen, thirteen, nine, five, four, three, two, and one. We will explain the existence places corresponding to each of them.

**"Tinn V Ya Baviise"** - There are three existence places for the twenty-two natural bondage places: twenty-eight, twenty-seven, and twenty-six natural. Their explanation is as follows:

The bondage of twenty-two natures occurs to the Mithyatva-affected Jiva, and its arising places are four: seven, eight, six, and ten natural. Of these, the twenty-eight natural existence place corresponds to the seven natural arising place. This is because the seven natural arising place occurs without the arising of Anantanu-bandhi, and the absence of the arising of Anantanu-bandhi in Mithyatva is only for the Jiva who, having previously attained Samyag-drishti, had disassociated the Anantanu-bandhi Chatushk and later, due to the influence of Pariṇāmayaśa Mithyatva, initiated the bondage of Anantanu-bandhi again due to Mithyatva. For that Jiva, the arising of Anantanu-bandhi does not occur for a period of one Avli-pramana. However, according to the rules, that Jiva possesses the existence of thirty-five natures. Therefore, in the seven natural arising place, there is only one twenty-eight natural existence place.

The eight natural arising place also has the same three existence places. This is because the eight natural arising place is of two types: 
1. Anantanu...

---------------------------
## Chapter on Sapta-tika

This chapter discusses two types of eight-fold natural states of existence: one without the rise of infinite karmic bonds (ananta-anubandhi) and the other with the rise of infinite karmic bonds. 

The eight-fold natural state of existence without the rise of infinite karmic bonds has only one state of being, which is the 28th natural state of being. This has been explained in the context of the seven-fold natural state of existence. 

The eight-fold natural state of existence with the rise of infinite karmic bonds has three states of being:

1. **28th natural state of being:** This state exists until the right faith (samyak-tva) is awakened.
2. **27th natural state of being:** This state exists after the awakening of right faith.
3. **26th natural state of being:** This state exists after the awakening of right faith and wrong faith (samyak-mithyatva). This 26th natural state of being is also present in the soul with eternal wrong faith (anadi-mithyadristi).

The nine-fold natural state of existence is also divided into two types: one without the rise of infinite karmic bonds and the other with the rise of infinite karmic bonds. The nine-fold natural state of existence without the rise of infinite karmic bonds has only one state of being, which is the 28th natural state of being. However, the nine-fold natural state of existence with the rise of infinite karmic bonds has three states of being, as explained above.

The ten-fold natural state of existence only exists with the rise of infinite karmic bonds. Otherwise, the ten-fold natural state of existence does not exist. Therefore, it has all three states of being: 28th, 27th, and 26th.

At the time of the 21st natural state of bondage, the state of being is only the 28th.

## The Sixth Karma Granth, Chapter 125

**The Nature of the Twenty-Eight:**

The twenty-eight are the nature of the *Sāsādan* *Samyagdṛṣṭi*. The *Sāsādan* *Samyaktva* arises from the *Upaśama* *Samyaktva* of a being who has deviated from it. However, such a being still possesses all three aspects of *Darśana* *Moha* *nīya*, because due to the *Samyaktva* quality, *Mithyā* *tva* is divided into three parts: *Mithyā* *tva*, *Samyag* *Mithyā* *tva*, and *Samyaktva*. Therefore, the existence of all three aspects of *Darśana* *Moha* *nīya* is established by rule.

Here, the *Udaya* *sthāna* of the seventh, eighth, and ninth *Prakṛti* are the three. Therefore, with the existence of three *Udaya* *sthāna* at the time of the twenty-one *Prakṛti* *Bandha* *sthāna*, there is one *Sattā* *sthāna* of twenty-eight *Prakṛti*.

**The Seventeen *Prakṛti* *Bandha* *sthāna* and Six *Sattā* *sthāna:**

The seventeen *Prakṛti* *Bandha* *sthāna* have six *Sattā* *sthāna* - "from seventy to six" - which are the twenty-eighth, twenty-seventh, twenty-sixth, twenty-fourth, twenty-third, twenty-second, and twenty-first *Prakṛti*.

**The *Samyag* *Mithyā* *dṛṣṭi* and *Avirata* *Samyag* *dṛṣṭi*:**

The *Samyag* *Mithyā* *dṛṣṭi* *Bandha* *sthāna* occurs in two *Guṇa* *sthāna*: *Samyag* *Mithyā* *dṛṣṭi* and *Avirata* *Samyag* *dṛṣṭi*.

The *Samyag* *Mithyā* *dṛṣṭi* beings have three *Udaya* *sthāna*: the seventh, eighth, and ninth *Prakṛti*. The *Avirata* *Samyag* *dṛṣṭi* beings have four *Udaya* *sthāna*: the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth *Prakṛti*.

**The Sixth *Prakṛti*:**

The twenty-first *Bandha* is the *Sāsādan* *Samyag* *dṛṣṭi*. The *Sāsādan* *tva* arises from the *Upaśama* *Samyaktva* of a being who has deviated from it. Due to the *Samyaktva* quality, *Mithyā* *tva* is divided into three parts: *Mithyā* *tva*, *Samyag* *Mithyā* *tva*, and *Samyaktva*. Therefore, the existence of all three aspects of *Darśana* *Moha* *nīya* is established by rule. With the existence of three *Udaya* *sthāna* at the time of the twenty-one *Bandha*, there is one *Sattā* *sthāna* of twenty-eight.

**The Seventeen *Bandha*:**

The seventeen *Bandha* are for the *Samyag* *Mithyā* *dṛṣṭi* and *Avirata* *Samyag* *dṛṣṭi*. The *Samyag* *Mithyā* *dṛṣṭi* have three *Udaya* *sthāna*: the seventh, eighth, and ninth. The *Avirata* *Samyag* *dṛṣṭi* have four *Udaya* *sthāna*: the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth.

The Saptaatika chapter states that the state of Udyaasthan, Upsham, and Samyagdristi is attained only by Kshayik Samyagdristi beings. A being with Upsham Samyagdristi has two states of existence: 28 and 24 Prakrutis. The state of 28 Prakrutis exists at the time of Prathamopahsam Samyaktva, while the state of 24 Prakrutis exists for the being who has attained Avirat Samyagdristi after the boiling up of Anantanubandhi. However, a Kshayik Samyagdristi being has only 21 Prakrutis. This is because the attainment of Kshayik Samyagdristi occurs only after the destruction of seven Prakrutis: Anantanubandhi Chatushk and Darshanmohatrik. Thus, there are three states of existence in the Udyaasthan of six Prakrutis: 28, 24, and 21 Prakrutis.

For beings with Samyagmithyatva, there are three states of existence: 28, 27, and 24 Prakrutis. A being with 28 Prakrutis who attains Samyagmithyatva has 28 Prakrutis. However, a Mithyadristi who has attained 27 Prakrutis by boiling up Samyaktva but has not yet boiled up Samyagmithyatva, if they attain the Samyagmithyatva Gunasthan by renouncing Mithyatva and due to the cause of the consequences, then that Samyagmithyatva being has 27 Prakrutis. 

The Digambar tradition does not mention the existence of 27 Prakrutis for Samyagmithyatva. The Go. Karmakanda mentions the Vedak period, during which any Mithyadristi being could be Vedak Samyagdristi or Samyagmithyatva. However, this period passes while the boiling up of Samyaktva continues. Therefore, the attainment of Vedak Samyaktva or the Samyagmithyatva Gunasthan is not mentioned for a being with 27 Prakrutis.

## Sixth Karma Abhy

**If a being, who has achieved the state of complete detachment from infinite karmic bonds while remaining in the collective existence, attains the state of Samyag-Mithyatva due to the influence of karmic results, then it is found to have twenty-four natural states of existence.** Such a being is found in all four gatis (types of existence). This is because beings in all four gatis who have attained Samyag-drishti (right faith) achieve detachment from infinite karmic bonds. 

**As stated in the Karma-prakriti:**

"Those who have attained the state of Paryapta (perfection) in all four gatis, achieve victory by detaching themselves from infinite karmic bonds. However, their Antarkarana (inner organ) and Upasama (subduing) of these infinite karmic bonds do not cease."

**Here, the special point is that in the state of Avirata Samyag-drishti (uninterrupted right faith), beings in all four gatis, Tiryanch (animals) and Manusya (humans) in the state of Desha-virati (freedom from the bondage of space), and only Manusya in the state of Sarva-virati (freedom from all bondages), achieve detachment from the four types of infinite karmic bonds.** After achieving detachment from infinite karmic bonds, many beings attain the state of Samyag-Mithyatva due to the influence of karmic results. This proves that Samyag-Mithyatva beings have twenty-four natural states of existence.

**However, in the case of Avirata Samyag-drishti beings, there are seven natural states of Udayasthan (states of arising), resulting in five states of existence: 28, 24, 23, 22, and 21.** Out of these, twenty...

## The Chapter of Seven

There are 24 natural states for both the Upashma Samyagdarshi and Vedak Samyagdarshi beings, but this is a special characteristic that the 24 natural states are for the being who has disjoined the Anantanubandhi Chatushk. The 23rd and 22nd natural states are only for the Vedak Samyagdarshi beings. Because a Vedak Samyagdarshi being who is eight years old or older and is striving for Kshapana, when his Anantanubandhi Chatushk and Mithyatva are destroyed, he attains the 23rd natural state. And then, when his Samyagmithyatva is destroyed, he attains the 22nd natural state. This being with the 22nd natural state, when he is in the final stage of destroying the Samyaktva nature and perhaps has already bound the previous life's lifespan, he is born in one of the four gatis after death. It is also said:

"Paddhwago u Manuso Nittho Ghausu Vi Gaisu." - This means that the beginning of the destruction of Darshanmohaniya is only done by a human being, but its end is in all four gatis.

Thus, the 22nd natural state is attained in all four gatis, but the 21st natural state is attained only by the Kshayik Samyagdarshi being. Because only after the destruction of the Anantanubandhi Chatushk and Darshanmohatrik, these seven natures, does Kshayik Samyagdarshan occur.

Similarly, even while having the 8th natural state of Udayasthan, Samyagmithya...

## Text Karmamanv

**126**  The three and five states of being, respectively, of the *Dristi* and *Avirat* *Samyagdristi* beings have been described earlier.  It should be understood in the same way for the nine natural *Udayasthanas*, but with this distinction: the nine natural *Udayasthanas* of the *Avirat* are only for the *Vedak* *Samyagdristi* beings, and the *Vedak* *Samyagdristi* beings have four states of being: 28, 24, 23, and 22 natural *Sastasthanas*. Therefore, here also, there are four states of being.

The summary of the aforementioned statement regarding the seventeen natural *Bandhastanas* is this: the *Samyagmithyadristi* has one *Bandhastan* of 17 natural *Prakritis*, three *Udayasthanas* of 7, 8, and 9 *Prakritis*, and three *Sastasthanas* of 26, 27, and 24 *Prakritis*. In the *Avirat* *Sambandhastara*, the *Upshama* *Samvadristi* has one *Bandhastan* of 15 natural *Prakritis*, three *Udayasthanas* of 6, 7, and 8 *Prakritis*, and two *Sastasthanas* of 28 and 24 *Prakritis*. The *Kshayik* *Samyagdristi* has one *Bandhastan* of 17 natural *Prakritis*, three *Udayasthanas* of 6, 7, and 8 *Prakritis*, and one *Sastasthan* of 21 *Prakritis*. The *Vedak* *Samyagdristi* has one *Bandhastan* of 17 natural *Prakritis*, three *Udayasthanas* of 7, 8, and 9 *Prakritis*, and four *Sastasthanas* of 28, 24, 23, and 22 *Prakritis*. The *Samvesha* *Bhangas* have been previously described, therefore, here only the number of *Bandhastanas* and other states of being are mentioned.

There are five states of being for the thirteen and nine natural *Bandhastanas*: "There are five states of being for the thirteen and nine *Bandhastanas*." These five *Sastasthanas* are 28, 24, 23, 22, and 21 *Prakritis*. The first thirteen natural *Bandhastanas* clarify the *Sastasthanas*.

The thirteen *Prakritis* are the *Bandha* of the *Deshavirat* and the *Veshavirat* are of two types: *Tithanch* and *Manushya*. "The *Tithanch* *Deshavirat*." There, the *Deshavirat* have thirteen *Bandhas*, and they are of two types: *Tithanch* and *Manushya*.

Page #168:
---------------------------
## Chapter 130: The Seven Vikalpa

There are two states of being, 28 and 24 in number, in all four of their places of arising. The 28 natural states of being are for both types of Tiryanch, those with Upashma Samyagdrsti and those with Vedak Samyagdrsti. Among them, the one who attains Deshavirat at the time of attaining the first Samyaktva, has 25 natural states of being while remaining in the state of Deshavirat. Because it is a rule that any Upashma Samyagdrsti Jiva existing in the Antarkaran Kala attains Deshavirat, and some humans even attain Sarvavirata. As it is said in Shatak Brihat Churni:

"Samasammadditti Ansarkaranee Thio Koi Vesabir Koi Emattapamattabhavam Pi Gachch, Sasarvarna Pum Na Kimvi Lahai."

Meaning, some Upashma Samyagdrsti Jivas residing in the Antarkaran attain Deshavirat, and some even attain Pramatta Samyama and Apramatta Bhava, but the Sasadan Samyagdrsti Jivas do not attain any of these.

This explains how the Upashma Samyagdrsti Jiva attains the Deshavirat Gunasthan. However, there is no particular obstacle in attaining Deshavirat along with Vedak Samyaktva. This leads to 28 natural states of being for Vedak Samyagdrsti in the Deshavirat Gunasthan. But the 24 natural states of being are for those Tiryanch who disengage from Anantanubandhi, and they are Vedak Samyagdrsti. Because in the Tiryanch Gati, Upashma Samyagdrsti:

1. In the Jayaghavala Tika, while instructing the Swami, the Jivas of all four Gatis are described as the Swami of the 24 natural states of being. According to this, the Upashma Samyagdrsti Jiva of each Gati can disengage from Anantanubandhi. This opinion is also supported by the Karm Prakriti Upashmana Prakaran, verse 31, which describes the Jivas of all four Gatis as capable of disengaging from Anantanubandhi. 

Page #169:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karma Granth, 131

**It is not possible to attain the 24th natural state of existence.**  Besides these two states of existence, the remaining 23, including the state of *Tich* and *Deshaviret*, do not exist. This is because they are only attained by beings who generate *Kshayik Samyavash*, and *Tich* does not generate *Kshayik Samyagdarshan*. Only humans can generate this.

**A curious question arises regarding the non-acceptance of the 23 natural states of existence in *Tiryach* beings.**

**Question:** It is true that *Tiryach* beings do not have 23 natural states of existence. However, when humans, having generated *Kshayik Samyagdarshan*, are reborn as *Tiryach*, they do attain the 21st and 22nd natural states of existence. Therefore, it is not logical to say that *Tiryach* beings do not have the 23 natural states of existence.

**Answer:** While it is true that a being with 22 natural states of existence, who has generated *Kshayik Samyaktva*, or a being with *Kshayik Samyagdristi*, may be reborn as a *Tiryach* after death, this being is not reborn as a *Tiryach* with a lifespan of a few years, but rather as a *Tiryach* with an immeasurable lifespan.

**Note:** The remaining 23 natural states of existence, including the 23rd, are not possible for *Tiryach* beings. These states are attained by those who generate *Shramik Samyaktva*. *Tiryach* beings do not generate *Kshayik Samyaktva*, only humans do.

## The Chapter of the Seven Tika

This arises only in the **Sapta Tika** and their **Desha Virati** does not occur. Due to the absence of **Desha Virati**, they do not attain the thirteen **Prakrutik Bandha Sthanas**. However, here, the consideration is of the **Satta Sthanas** within the thirteen **Prakrutik Bandha Sthanas**. Therefore, the statement above, that the twenty-three **Prakrutik Satta Sthanas** do not occur in **Tiryachas**, is correct in relation to the thirteen **Prakrutik Bandha Sthanas**. 

It is also stated in **Churni**:

"Twenty-one **Prakrutik Satta Sthanas** are not possible in **Sanjata** and **Asanjata Tiryachas**. Why? Because **Kshayik Samyagdrishti** beings are not born in **Tiryachas** with a lifespan of a countable number of years. They are born in **Tiryachas** with an uncountable number of years, but there is no **Desha Virati** for them."

Thus, after considering the **Tiryachas**, we now consider the **Manushyas**. Those **Manushyas** who have attained **Desha Virati**, have three **Satta Sthanas** with five **Prakrutik Udaya Sthanas**: twenty-eight, twenty-four, and twenty-one **Prakrutik Satta Sthanas**. With six and seven **Prakrutik Udaya Sthanas**, there are five **Satta Sthanas** in each: twenty-eight, twenty-four, twenty-three, twenty-two, and twenty-one **Prakrutik Satta Sthanas**. With eight **Prakrutik Udaya Sthanas**, there are four **Satta Sthanas**: twenty-eight, twenty-four, twenty-three, and twenty-two **Prakrutik Satta Sthanas**. 

By considering the **Prakrutis** in **Udaya Sthanas**, the determination of their causes becomes easy. Just as it is stated in the **Avirat Samyagdrishti Gunasthanas**, it should be understood here as well. Therefore, instead of stating it separately, only a hint is given about how many **Satta Sthanas** occur in each **Udaya Sthanas**.

## Sixth Karma Granth

**There are nine natural bondage states (bandha sthana) for both the attentive (pramattasanyata) and inattentive (apramattasanyata) beings. For these, there are four, five, six, and seven natural states (prakriti), which are the four arising states (udayasthan).**

**With four natural arising states, there are 28, 24, and 21 natural states (prakriti), which are the three being states (sattaasthan). This is because this arising state is only attained by the subdued (upshama) right-seeing (samyagdristi) and the destructive (kshayika) right-seeing.**

**With five natural states and this natural arising state, there are five being states each. This is because these arising states are possible for all three types of right-seeing (samyasti) - subdued, destructive, and omniscient (vedaka).**

**However, with seven natural arising states, only four being states are possible, not 21, because the omniscient right-seeing is possible here.**

**The 'Panchavah Uvihech' ... states that there are six being states each in the five and four natural bondage states. This means there are six being states for the five natural bondage states and six being states for the four natural bondage states. However, there is a difference in the number of natural states of both, which is explained below.**

**First, we will explain the being states of the five natural bondage states. The number of six being states of the five natural bondage states is as follows: 28, 24, 21, 13, 12, and 11.**

**Their explanation is as follows:**

**1. For both the one and nine bondage states, for both the attentive and inattentive, there are three being states each for every four arising states. Thus, there are 28, 24, and 21. For every five arising states and six arising states, there are five being states each. For seven arising states, there are four being states remaining, excluding 21.**

**2. In the five types of bondage, there are these: 28, 24, 21, 13, 12, and 11.**

##  Translation:

**154**

The five natural bondage-places (**Pancha-Prakritik Bandha-Sthan**) are present in the **Upashmani** and **Kshapakani** stages until the bondage of the **Purusha-Veda** in the **Anivriti-vada** (non-returner) souls.  And until the bondage of the **Purusha-Veda**, the six **No-Kshaya** (non-destructive) states exist. Therefore, the five natural bondage-places do not have the presence of **Papa** (sin) and other states.

Now, the remaining states are present in the **Upashmani** stage. There are three natural states: **28**, **24**, and **21**. The **21** and **24** natural states are found in the **Upashma-Shreni** (stage of liberation) for the **Upashma Samyag-Drishti** (liberated soul with perfect vision). The **21** natural state is found in the **Upashma-Shreni** for the **Kshayik Samyag-Drishti** (liberated soul with perfect vision, but still subject to subtle karmic influences).

In the **Kshapakani** stage, the **21** natural state is present until the eight **Kshaya** (destructive) states are destroyed.

Therefore, in comparison to the **Upashmani** stage, there are three natural states: **28**, **24**, and **21**. However, there is a special characteristic: the **28** and **24** natural states are present only in the **Upashma-Shreni** for the **Upashma Samyag-Drishti** soul. But the **21** natural state is present in the **Upashma-Shreni** for the **Kshayik Samyag-Drishti** soul and also in the **Kshapakani** stage until the eight **Kshaya** states are destroyed.

**Footnotes:**

1. The five states, etc., are not found in the five-poison bondage, because the five-poison bondage is bound in the **Purusha-Veda**. And since the bondage of the **Purusha-Veda**, the six **No-Kshaya** states exist.
- **Sapta-Tika Prakaran Tokar**, page 154

2. There are **28** and **24** for the **Upashma Samyag-Drishti** in the **Upashmani** stage. **21** is present in the **Upashmani** stage for the **Kshayik Samyag-Drishti**.
- **Sapta-Tika Prakaran Teeka**, page 154

## Sixth Karma-Praya

The **Kshapaka** श्रेणि (category) has 13, 12, and 11 natural **Satta-sthana** (states of being) and when 21 natural **Satta-sthana** are added to them, the **Kshapaka-ming** (category) has 51, 13, 12, and **Par** (transcendental) **Satta-sthana**.  There are 21 natural **Satta-sthana** until the eight **Kshaya** (destructive forces) are destroyed, and 13 natural **Satta-sthana** after the eight **Kshaya** are destroyed.  Of these, when **Nupusak-veda** (the karma of being a eunuch) is destroyed, there are 12 natural **Satta-sthana**, and when **Stri-veda** (the karma of being a woman) is destroyed from the 12 natural **Satta-sthana**, there are 11 natural **Satta-sthana**.

Thus, in the five natural **Bandha-sthana** (states of bondage), there are six **Satta-sthana**: 28, 24, 21, 13, 12, and 11 natural **Satta-sthana**. Now, we will clarify the six **Satta-sthana** of the four natural **Bandha-sthana**.  In the four natural **Bandha-sthana**, there are six **Satta-sthana**: 28, 24, 21, 11, 5, and 4 natural **Satta-sthana**.  The four natural **Bandha-sthana** exist in both the **Upshama-shreni** (category) and the **Kshapaka-vani** (category).  The explanation given earlier for the 28, 24, and 21 natural **Satta-sthana** found in the **Upshama-shreni** should be understood here as well.  Now, regarding the **Kshapaka-vani**, the rule is that a being who ascends to the **Kshapaka-vani** with the arising of **Nupusak-veda** destroys **Nupusak-veda** and **Stri-veda** simultaneously, and with this, the bondage of **Purusha-veda** (the karma of being a man) is broken.  After that, its **Purusha-veda** and **Hasya-adi Shatka** (six types of karma related to laughter, etc.) are destroyed simultaneously.  If a being arises with **Stri-veda**, 

1.  **Chatur-vidha-bandhe punar-amuni shat satta-sthanaani, taptha-ashta-vimsha-ti, chatur-vimsha-ti, eka-vimsha-ti, eka-dasha, pancha, chatasraha.**

## Chapter 73

When a being ascends the क्षपकश्रेणि with क्षपकणि, it first sheds the नपुंसक वेद, then in the अन्तर्मुहूर्त time, it sheds the स्त्रोवेद. After that, the पुरुषवेद and the six हास्यादि are shed together. However, even during the shedding of स्त्रीवेद, the पुरुषवेद is stopped. Thus, with the rise of स्त्रीवेद and नपुंसक वेद, the being ascending the क्षपकश्रेणि either at the end of the shedding of स्त्रीवेद or at the end of the shedding of स्त्रीवेद and नपुंसकवेद, experiences the अन्धविच्छेद of पुरुषवेद. This results in the being attaining eleven प्रकृतिक सत्तास्थान with only one प्रकृति remaining in its four प्रकृतिक बंधस्थान without the rise of वेद. This being sheds the पुरुषवेद and the six हास्यादि together. Therefore, it attains four प्रकृतिक सत्तास्थान instead of five. However, the being that ascends the क्षपकश्रेणि with the rise of पुरुषवेद, experiences the बंधविच्छेद of पुरुषवेद only when its six नोकषायों are shed. This results in the being attaining five प्रकृतिक सत्तास्थान instead of eleven in its four प्रकृतिक बंधस्थान. This सत्तास्थान remains for two times less than two आवली काल, and then it attains four प्रकृतिक सत्तास्थान for the अन्तर्मुहूर्त काल.

**1**

In the चूर्णि of कषायप्राभूत, the time for both the अभ्य and उत्कृष्ट types of five प्रकृतिक सत्तास्थान is stated as one time less than two आवली:

"What is the time for the five प्रकृतिक सत्तास्थान? It is two आवली times less than one time."

## Chapter 73

It is said that when there are three natural bondage-places, there are four natural existence-places until the destruction of the karma, and when it is destroyed, there are three natural existence-places in the three natural bondage-places, which lasts until the end of the moment.

Thus, there are five existence-places in the three natural bondage-places: 28, 24, 21, 4, and 3 natural. In the two natural bondage-places, there are five existence-places as follows: 28, 24, 21, 3, and 2 natural.

Similarly, when the first state of the Sanjvalana Maya remains for one Avali Praman, the bondage, arising, and excitation are all destroyed at the same time. At that time, two natural bondage-places are obtained, but at that time, except for the first state Dalik of the Sanjvalana Maya, which remains for one Avali Praman, and the two time-bound Mavali Praman, the destruction of all others takes place. Although the remaining good karma will be destroyed by two Avali Praman time less two times, until its destruction, there are three natural existence-places in the two natural bondage-places. After its destruction, there are two natural existence-places in the two natural bondage-places. Its time is the end of the moment.

Thus, there are five existence-places in the two natural bondage-places: 28, 24, 21, 3, and 2 natural.

The five existence-places in the one natural bondage-place are as follows: 28, 24, 21, 2, and 1 natural. Of these, the 28, 24, and 21 natural existence-places should be understood in relation to the Upshama. The description of the remaining 2 and 1 natural existence-places is as follows: In the same way, when the first state of the Sanjvalana Maya remains for one Avali Praman, the bondage, arising, and excitation are all destroyed at the same time, and...

### 136

After that, there is a natural bond, but at that time, except for the first positional Dalik with one Avali Praman of Sanjwalan Maya and the time-bound with two Avali Praman less than two times, the rest of all are destroyed. Although this remaining Satkarma will also be destroyed by two Avali Praman less than two times, until its destruction, two natures are found in the natural bond-state. After its destruction, only the Sanjwalan Lobha remains in the natural bond-state.

Thus, there are five states of existence in the natural bond-state: 28, 24, 21, 2, and 1 Prakruti. Now, even in the absence of bond, there is a Mithan of the existing states of existence. Therefore, it is said in the Gana: 'Battaariy Bandhavocchae' - meaning, there are four states of existence in the absence of bond. These four states of existence are: 28, 24, 21, and 1 Prakruti. The absence of bond occurs in the tenth subtle Sampraya Gunasthan. The one who ascends to the subtle Sampraya Gunasthan by climbing the Upshama Shreni, although he does not have the bond of Mohaniya Karma, but his 28, 24, and 21 Prakruti, these three states of existence are possible. And the one who ascends to the subtle Sampraya Gunasthan by climbing the Kshapaka Shreni, has the existence of Sanjwalan Lobha. Therefore, in the absence of bond, 28, 24, 21, and 1 Prakruti, these four states of existence are considered.

Thus, the bond, उदय (Uday), and states of existence of Mohaniya Karma, and the destruction of their perceptions are indicated. Their complete explanation is as follows:

1. In the subtle Sampraya Gunasthan, there are four states of existence in the absence of bond: 28, 24, 21, and 1 Prakruti. Of these, the first three are in the Upshama Shreni. The one with the nature of Sanjwalan Lobha is in the Kshapaka Shreni.

Although the Uttar Prakrutis of Namakarm are ninety-nine. But all of them are not bound to any living being at the same time, therefore, the consideration of how many Prakrutis are bound together at the same time has been done through eight Bandasthan. Among these, some are Bandasthan suitable for Tiryanch-Gati, some for Manushya-Gati, some for Dev-Gati and some for Narak-Gati, and even in this, there are many Avantaar differences. Therefore, we consider them here along with these Avantaar differences.
In Tiryanch-Gati, there are living beings from Ekendriya to Panchendriya.

## Sapta-trika Prakarana

There are five Bandha-sthana (bond-places) for the beings eligible for Tiryancha-gati (animal realm) in general, namely: 23, 25, 26, 29, and 30. Among these, there are three Bandha-sthana for the beings eligible for Eka-indriya (one-sense) nature, namely: 23, 25, and 26.

The 23rd Bandha-sthana consists of the following 23 natures: Tiryancha-gati, Tithancha-anupurvi, Eka-indriya jati, Audarik sharira, Tejas sharira, Karman sharira, Hund-samsthana, Varna, Rasa, Gandha, Sparsha, Aguru-laghu, Upghāt nāma, Sthāvar nāma, Sūkṣma and Bādar (one of these), Aparyāpta nāma, Pratyek and Sādhāraṇa (one of these), Sthira, Ashubha, Subhang, Janādeya, Ayash-photi, and Nirman.

The collective of these 23 natures is called the 23rd Bandha-sthana. This Bandha-sthana occurs for the Mithya-drishti (false-vision) Tiryancha and Manushya (human) beings eligible for the Aparyāpta Eka-indriya nature.

Here, four bhang (breakage) are obtained. It has been mentioned above that the bond occurs for either Bādar or Sūkṣma, and either Pratyek or Sādhāraṇa. Therefore, if someone has bonded with Pratyek along with Bādar once, and with Sādhāraṇa along with Bādar another time, then...

**P**

In the twenty-five natural binding places, there is a binding of the twenty-five natures: **Tiryanchgati**, **Tiryanch Anupurvi**, **Ekaindriya Jati**, **Audarik Sharira**, **Tejas Sharira**, **Karman Sharira**, **Ind Sansthan**, **Varna Chatushk**, **Aguru Laghu**, **Upghat**, **Paraghat**, **Uchchhvas**, **Sthavar**, **Badar**, and **Sukshma** - any one of these from the **Paryapt**, **Each**, and **Sadharan**; any one from **Sthir** and **Asthir**; any one from **Shubh** and **Ashubh**; any one from **Yash: Kirti** and **Ayash: Kirti**; **Dubhang**, **Anadeya**, and **Nirman**.

The collection of these twenty-five natures is called a twenty-five natural binding place. This binding place is for the **Mithyadrishti** **Tiryanch** human and god who binds with the natures suitable for **Paryapt** **Ekaindriya**.

There are twenty breaks in this binding place. They are as follows: When a being binds with **Badar**, **Paryapt**, and **Each**, then due to the binding of any one from **Sthir** and **Asthir**, any one from **Shubh** and **Ashubh**, and any one from **Yash: Kirti** and **Ayash: Kirti**, eight breaks occur. And when a being binds with **Badar**, **Paryapt**, and **Sadharan**, then instead of binding with **Yash: Kirti**, it binds with **Ayash: Kirti**.

**No Sumati Gen Jasam**

And **Aparyapt** does not bind with **Yash: Kirti** in any of these three. Due to the cause of **Ayash: Kirti**, even when binding with **Sukshma**, **Sadharan** one, which leads to **Yash: Kirti** and...

## The Chapter of the Seven Tika

The seven tika categories are not possible. Now, the remaining are stable-unstable and auspicious-inauspicious, these two pairs. So, their combination is possible, meaning with stable, once auspicious, once inauspicious, and similarly with unstable, once auspicious and once inauspicious, is possible. Therefore, here there are a total of four categories. If someone does a bond of victory, defeat, and sufficient, then out of these, one bond of inauspiciousness occurs, but because of the bond of one from each of the ordinary, stable-unstable, and auspicious-inauspicious, there are eight categories. Thus, in the twenty-five natural bond places, there are 8-4+8=20 categories.

The community of twenty-six natures is called the twenty-six natural bond place. This bond place is for the natures suitable for sufficient and the one-sense, which are bound with one nature from the heat and effort, for the false-sighted, the non-controlling, the controlling, and the gods. The categories taken in the twenty-six natural bond place are as follows: non-controlling motion, transmigratory motion, one-sense motion, generous body, radiance, karmic body, body-formation, color-form, non-home-dwelling, external-injury, internal-injury, high-dwelling, stationary, heat, and effort, one from each of these, sufficient, each, stable-unstable, auspicious-inauspicious, one from each of these, two-categories, non-destroyable, auspiciousness, and inauspiciousness, and creation.

There are sixteen categories in this bond place. These categories are formed due to the bond of one nature from each of heat-effort, stable-unstable, auspicious-inauspicious, and auspiciousness-inauspiciousness. Heat and effort...

## Sixth Karma Chapter
### 147

There is no binding of subtle and gross with the sixth karma. Therefore, the destructions obtained from the subtle and gross are not mentioned here.

Thus, there are 40 destructions of the three 'binding places' of the one-sense-capable, namely 23, 25 and 26 natures. It is also said:

"Four, twenty, sixteen destructions of the one-sense-capable, totaling forty."

That is, there are four destructions of the binding place of the 23 natures related to the one-sense-capable, twenty destructions of the binding place of the 25 natures, and sixteen destructions of the binding place of the 26 natures. All these together make forty.

After mentioning the binding places of the one-sense-capable, the binding places of the two-sense-capable are explained.

The three binding places of the being who binds the two-sense-capable natures are 25, 26 and 30 natures. Their description is as follows:

The binding place in the form of the aggregate of twenty-five natures is called the twenty-five nature binding place. The bound in this place are the two-sense-capable natures of the insufficient, the false-belief human and the Tiryach. The names of the natures of the twenty-five nature binding place are as follows:

* Tithanchgati
* Tithanchanumurti
* Dwiindriya jati
* Audarik sharira
* Tejas sharira
* Karman sharira
* Huinsthan
* Sevatam sanhanan
* Audarik angopam
* Varnachatusk
* Agurulghu
* Upadhat
* Bas
* Badar
* Apariapt
* Pratyek
* Asthir
* Ashubh
* Durbhg
* Anadeya
* Ayash:kauti
* Nirman

Here, only the inauspicious natures bind with the insufficient nature, not the auspicious natures, resulting in only one destruction.

"There are three binding places of the two-sense-capable, namely twenty-five, twenty-six and thirty."

**The Journey of the Soul**

From the twenty-five **Prakritis** (fundamental principles), by combining the insufficient **Paradhat**, **Uchchhvas**, **Aprashasht Vihayogati**, **Paryapt**, and **Dushwar**, we get twenty-nine **Prakriti Bandhasthan** (bondage states). These twenty-nine **Prakritis** are as follows:

* **Tiryachgati** (animal realm)
* **Tiryachanupurvi** (animal-like)
* **Dwiindriya Jati** (two-sense beings)
* **Audarik Sharira** (gross body)
* **Tejas Sharira** (fire body)
* **Karman Sharira** (karma body)
* **Audarik Angopang** (gross limbs)
* **Dandasanasthan** (punishment state)
* **Seva Sanhanan** (service and suffering)
* **Varn Chatushk** (four castes)
* **Agurulghu** (heavy and light)
* **Paradhat** (external injury)
* **Upadhat** (internal injury)
* **Uchchhvas** (exhalation)
* **Aprashasht Vihayogati** (unsuitable death)
* **Shras** (fatigue)
* **Badar** (obstruction)
* **Paryapt** (sufficient)
* **Pratyek** (individual)
* **Sthir** (stable)
* **Asthir** (unstable)
* **Shubh** (auspicious)
* **Ashubh** (inauspicious)
* **Durmang** (evil thoughts)
* **Dushwar** (bad speech)
* **Anadeya** (unworthy)
* **Yasha Kirti** (fame)
* **Ayasha Kirti** (infamy)

These twenty-nine **Prakritis** constitute the twenty-nine **Prakriti Bandhasthan**. This **Bandhasthan** binds the **Mithyadrishti** (false-believing) soul, who is worthy of the **Dwiindriya** (two-sense) **Prakritis**.

**145.2**

In this **Bandhasthan**, each **Prakriti** from the pairs of **Sthir-Asthir**, **Shubh-Ashubh**, and **Yasha Kirti-Ayasha Kirti** is bound by choice, resulting in eight **Bhang** (types of bondage).

By adding the **Uchchhon** **Prakriti** to these twenty-nine, we get thirty **Prakriti Bandhasthan**. This **Bandhasthan** is also bound by the **Mithyadrishti** soul, who is worthy of the **Dwiindriya** **Prakritis**. Here too, there are eight **Bhang**. Thus, there are 18 + 6 = 24 **Bhang**.

The **Mithyadrishti** soul, who is worthy of the **Triindriya** (three-sense) and **Chaturindriya** (four-sense) **Prakritis**, also has three **Bandhasthan** each, as described earlier. However, it should be understood that in the **Triindriya** **Prakritis**, the term **Chaturindriya Jati** should be used. The **Bhang** for each are seventeen, meaning seventeen **Bhang** for **Triindriya** and seventeen for **Chaturindriya**. Thus, there are a total of forty-one **Bhang** for the **Vikalatrika** (those with limited senses). As it is said:

## Sixth Karma Granth

**ve**

One, eight, and eight are the number of bhangas in each of the 25, 21, and 30 natural bandha sthans respectively, which bind in each of the three vikal trayas. In total, there are 51 bhangas in all three.

Until now, the bandha sthans of the Tiryanchgatis from Ekendriya to Chaturindriya have been discussed. Now, we will discuss the bandha sthans suitable for the Tiryanchgatis with Panchendriya.

There are three natural bandha sthans that bind the Tiryanchgatis with Panchendriya, namely 25, 26, and 30. The 25 natural bandha sthans are the same as the 25 natural bandha sthans mentioned for the Dwindriya, but instead of Dwindriya jati, it should be Panchendriya jati. Here, there is one bhang.

The 29 natural bandha sthans consist of 29 prakritis, namely: Tiryanchgat, Tich Anupurvi, Panchendriya Jati, Audavisharira, Audarik Angopang, Taijas Sharira, Karman Sharira, one of the six Sansthans, one of the six Sanhanans, Varnachaturk Agurulghu, Upghāt, Paraghat, Ucchvas, Prashast and Aprashast Vihayogati, one of each, Bas, Badar, Paryapt, one of each stable and unstable, one of each auspicious and inauspicious, one of each Subhag and Dubhang, one of each Muswar and Duswar, one of each Aadey and Anaadey, one of each Yash Kirti and Ayash Kirti, and finally, Nirman. This bandha sthan is sufficient to bind the four gatis with Panchendriya.

The three bandha sthans suitable for the Tiryanchgatis with Panchendriya are: 25, 29, and 30. - Saptaka Prakaran Toka, page 177.

## Chapter 15: The Seven Tika

**Who is a Mithyadristi Jiva?**

If a bound state is bound by a Sasadan Samyagdristi, then it is bound by one of the five Sanhananas and one of the five Sansthanas of the beginning. Because the Sasadan Samyagdristi Jiva is not bound by the Hund Sansthana and the Sebal Sanhanana.

**Hundam Asampatam Va Sasani Ma Bandhai.** This means that the Sasadan Samyagdristi Jiva is not bound by the Hund Sansthana and the Asanshapta Sanhanana.

In these 29 natural bound states, there is a binding of one of the six Sansthanas, one of the six Sanhananas, one of the Prashastha and Aprashastha Vihayogatis, one of the Sthira and Asthira, one of the Shubha and Ashubha, one of the Subhaga and Durbhaga, one of the Susvara and Dusvara, one of the Aadeya and Anaadeya, and one of the Yash:koti and Ayash:koti. Therefore, multiplying all these numbers, we get 6 x 642424242 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 284605 bhangas.

This state is also bound by the Sasadan Samyagdristi, but it is bound by five Sanhananas and five Sansthanas, so it has 54542 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 24242 - 3200 bhangas. However, these are included in the previously mentioned bhangas, so they are not counted separately.

Adding one Udyot Prakriti to the aforementioned 29 natural bound states, we get 30 natural bound states. Just as in the 29 natural bound states, there is a difference between Mithyadristi and Sasadan Samyagdristi...

## Chapter 152: The Thirty Natural Bonds

It is necessary to say "human path," "human lineage," and "five-sensed" in place of "animal path," "animal lineage," and "two-sensed" here. The twenty-nine natural bonds are of three types: one with respect to false vision, the second with respect to the temporary right vision, and the third with respect to the right-false vision or uninterrupted right vision. Of these, the twenty-nine natural bonds applicable to the animal path have been explained with respect to false vision and temporary right vision. Similarly, it should be understood here, but instead of the natural bonds applicable to the animal path, the natural bonds applicable to the human path should be considered.

In the third type of twenty-nine natural bonds, there is a bond of these twenty-nine natural bonds: human path, human lineage, five-sensed beings, generous body, generous limbs, fiery body, dark body, square-shaped body, strong body, four-color, heavy-light, attack, counter-attack, exhalation, good path of liberation, S, Badar, sufficient, each, stable and unstable, one of auspicious and inauspicious, auspicious, melodious, worthy of being given, fame and infamy, and creation.

There are 4608 breaks in these three types of twenty-nine natural bonds. Although there is a difference in the breaks due to the difference in the quality-places, the 4608 breaks are mentioned here without considering the difference in the quality-places.

By adding the name of the Tirthankara to the above twenty-nine natural bonds, there are thirty natural bonds. In this bond, stable and...

## The Bond of Karma: A Translation

**Chapter 153**

Multiplying the number of possibilities for each of the following: one from the stable and unstable, one from the auspicious and inauspicious, and one from the praiseworthy and blameworthy, we get 2x2x2=8 types of bonds. This means there are eight types of bonds for the thirty natural bond-places.

Thus, there are a total of 1+460884617 bonds in the twenty-five, twenty-six, and thirty natural bond-places that are suitable for the human path.

**"One in the twenty-five, 4608 in the twenty-nine, and eight in the thirty."**

This means that there is one bond in the twenty-five natural bond-places suitable for the human path, 4608 in the twenty-nine, and eight in the thirty. These total 4617 bonds.

Now we will discuss the bond-places suitable for the divine path. There are four bond-places for the beings bound by the natural qualities suitable for the divine path: twenty-eight, twenty-six, thirty, and thirty-one.

**In the twenty-eight natural bond-place:** There is a bond of the following twenty-eight qualities: divine path, divine ancestry, five-sense beings, subtle body, subtle limbs, luminous body, karmic body, square-shaped body, four colors, heavy-light, severe blow, mild blow, exhalation, auspicious liberation, S, Badar, sufficient, one each from the stable and unstable, one each from the auspicious and inauspicious, auspicious, order, good voice, one each from the praiseworthy and blameworthy, and creation. Therefore, this collection of qualities is called a bond-place. This bond-place occurs for those beings who are bound by the natural qualities suitable for the divine path, namely those who are of false vision, those who are of partial right vision, those who are of complete false vision, those who are of unwavering right vision, those who are of limited liberation, and those who are of complete liberation.

**"There are four bond-places for those who are bound by the divine path, namely: twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty, and thirty-one."** - *Commentary on the Saptaatika Prakarana, page 176* 

Page #192:
---------------------------
## Chapter of the Seventies

In this place, there is bondage of one of the following: stable or unstable, auspicious or inauspicious, and fame or infamy. Therefore, multiplying the above numbers, we get 22 x 2 = 44 Bhagas.

The above 28 natural bondage places, when combined with the Tirthankara nature, become 29 natural bondage places. The bondage of the Tirthankara nature occurs in the states of uninterrupted right faith, etc. This bondage place is therefore only for beings with uninterrupted right faith, etc. Here too, there are eight Bhagas, similar to the 28 natural bondage places.

The community of thirty natures is called the thirty natural bondage places. The natures taken in this bondage place are as follows: Deva-Gati, Deva-Anupurvi Pancha-Indriya Jati, Aharaka-Dvika Vaikriya Sharira, Vaikriya Ango-Upanga, Tejas Sharira, Karman Sharira, Rama-Chaturasra Sansthan, Varna-Chatushk, Agugalabu Upadhat, Paradhat, Ucchvas, Prashasta Vihayoga-Gati Tras, Badar, Paryapt, Pratyek, Shubh, Sthira, Subhag, Suswar, Adeva, Yash-Kirti, and Nirman. The one who is bound by this should be known as the one who is in the state of uninterrupted restraint or the one who is in the state of the previous action. In this place, there is bondage of all auspicious karmas, therefore there is only one Bhaga here.

When one Tirthankara name is added to the thirty natural bondage places, it becomes thirty-one natural bondage places. Here too, there is only one Bhaga. Thus, there are 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 12 Bhagas in the bondage places suitable for Deva-Gati. It is also said:

"Atuṭu eka ekkaga bhaṅga baṭṭhār deva-jogesu."

This is the knowledge of the one who is bound by the Deva-Gati, the one who is in the state of uninterrupted restraint, or the one who is in the state of the previous action.

**There is one bandha sthans for beings who are bound by the natural qualities suitable for narakagati. This bandha sthans has 28 natural qualities, hence it is considered as one bandha sthans. This bandha sthans is only for mithyadrishti. Since all the inauspicious qualities are bound here, there is only one bhang.**

**The natural qualities that are taken in the 28 natural bandha sthans are as follows:**

* Narakati
* Narakanugu
* Panchendriya jati
* Vakriya sharir
* Bainkriya angopang

**In addition to these 23 bandha sthans, there is one more bandha sthans which occurs in the three gunasthans, Apurvakaran, etc., after the bandha vicched of the natural qualities suitable for devagati. This one natural bandha sthans only has the bandha of Yashākiiti namkarma.**

**Now, let's consider how many bhangs are there in total in each bandha sthans.**

**One bandha sthans is characterized by Yashākoti. This bandha sthans occurs in the three gunasthans, Apurvakaran, etc., after the bandha vicched of the natural qualities suitable for devagati.**

## Sixth Karma Granth

**Twenty-five Natural Bond-Places:** There are a total of twenty-five bhangs in the twenty-five natural bond-places. This is because there are twenty bhangs for a being who binds the twenty-five tendencies suitable for an ekendriya (one-sensed being), and one bhang each for beings who bind the twenty-five tendencies suitable for an aparyapt dwi-indriya (deficient two-sensed being), shri-indriya (three-sensed being), chatur-indriya (four-sensed being), tiryanch panch-indriya (animal five-sensed being), and manushya-gati (human realm). Therefore, by adding these five bhangs to the aforementioned twenty bhangs, there are a total of twenty-five bhangs in the twenty-five natural bond-places.

**Twenty-six Natural Bond-Places:** There are a total of sixteen bhangs in the twenty-six natural bond-places. This is because it only occurs for beings who bind the tendencies suitable for an ekendriya, and the first sixteen bhangs have already been mentioned for the twenty-six natural bond-places suitable for an ekendriya. Therefore, these same sixteen bhangs should be known for this twenty-six natural bond-place.

**Twenty-eight Natural Bond-Places:** There are a total of nine bhangs in the twenty-eight natural bond-places. This is because there are eight bhangs in the twenty-eight natural bond-places for a being who binds the tendencies suitable for dev-gati (heavenly realm), and one bhang in the twenty-eight natural bond-places for a being who binds the tendencies suitable for narak-gati (hell realm). This place is not attained by any other beings except for devas and narakas. Therefore, there are a total of nine bhangs in this place.

**Twenty-nine Natural Bond-Places:** There are 248 bhangs in the twenty-nine natural bond-places. This is because there are 4608 bhangs in the twenty-nine natural bond-places suitable for tiryanch panch-indriya, 4608 bhangs in the twenty-nine natural bond-places suitable for manushya-gati, and eight bhangs each in the twenty-nine natural bond-places suitable for dwi-indriya, shri-indriya, chatur-indriya, and dev-gati (including those who attain the status of a Tirthankara). Thus, by adding all these bhangs together, there are a total of 4608 + 4608 + 8 + 8 = 9232 bhangs in the twenty-nine natural bond-places.

Because there are 4608 destructions of the thirty natural bondages for those who are fit for the animal realm, and there are eight destructions each for those who are fit for the two-sense, three-sense, four-sense, and human realms, and there is one destruction for those who are fit for the god realm along with the food-taker. Thus, adding the said destructions, the total destructions of the thirty natural bondage places are 4608 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 1 = 4641.

There is one destruction each for the thirty-one natural and one unnatural bondage places.

Thus, the destructions of all these bondage places are 13645. They should be understood in this way: 4 + 25 + 16 + 6 + 6248 + 4641 + 1 + 1 = 13945.

See the table on page 156 for the description of the bondage places of name-karma and their total destructions.

After stating the bondage places of name-karma, now we will tell about the arising places.

**Twenty-two, twenty-four, twenty-eight, thirty-one. These are the arising places, nine in number. ** ||26||

## Chapter on Sapta-Tika

**Word Meaning:** 
* **Vising-Visa:** Twenty and twenty-one
* **Chavis-Gai:** From twenty-four
* **Egalia:** One more than the previous
* **Igti-sa:** Up to thirty-one
* **Udayatthanaani:** Places of arising
* **Bhave:** Become
* **Nav Attham:** Nine and eight (referring to the nature of the karma)
* **Hanti:** Become
* **Namassanama-karma:** Karma of name and form

**Verse Meaning:** 
The twenty, twenty-one, and from twenty-four onwards, one nature more than the previous, up to thirty-one, and eight and nine natures, these twelve are the places of arising of the karma of name and form.

**Specific Meaning:** 
After explaining the binding places of the karma of name and form, this verse explains the places of arising. These places of arising are twelve, whose natures are numbered as follows: 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 8, and 9. The explanation of these places of arising will be given below based on the paths of the animals, humans, gods, and hell beings.

**Explanation:** 
Out of the twelve places of arising of the karma of name and form, the five places of arising for the one-sensed beings are 21, 24, 25, 26, and 27 natures. Here, the twelve natures of Tejas, Karman, Agurul-ghu, Sthira, Asthira, Shubha, Ashubha, Varna-chatuṣka, and Nirman are Dhruva (fixed) in relation to arising. Because, up to the thirteenth, the Sāyogika-kevali Gunasthāna, their arising happens for everyone according to the rule. In these twelve Dhruva-udaya (fixed arising) natures, one each from the nine natures of Tiryanch-gati, Tiryanch-anupūrvi, Sthāvara, Panchendriya jāti, Bādar-sūkṣma, Paryāpta-aparyāpta, Durbhaga, Anādeya, and Yaśaḥ-kīti-ayaśaḥ-kīti, when combined, result in the place of arising of twenty-one natures. This place of arising is for the one-sensed being existing in the interval of fear. There are five bhangas (breaks) in this place of arising, which are as follows: Yādar-paryāpta, Bādar-aparyāpta, Sūkṣma-paryāpta, Sūkṣma-aparyāpta. These four...

## Sixth Karma Granth, Chapter 162

One should describe the **Mangas** with **Ayesha Kirti** (negative fame), resulting in four **Bhangs** (divisions).  Similarly, describing the **Badar** with **Yasha Kirti** (positive fame) results in one more **Bhang**. Thus, there are a total of five **Bhangs**.

Although there are 222 **Bhangs** due to three **Ghugal** (variations) in the 21 **Prakritis** (categories), three **Bhangs** are reduced because **Yasha Kirti** does not arise with **Sookshma** (subtle) and **Apayampta** (insufficient).

Even though **Paryaptis** (sufficient) do not begin in the **Apantral** (interval between births), the **Paryapta** **Namkarma** (karma related to the body) arises from the very beginning. Therefore, a being existing in the **Apantral** is considered **Paryapta** due to its **Labdhi** (gain), as the fulfillment of **Paryaptis** occurs according to the rules.

By combining one of the four **Prakritis** - **Audarik** (generous) body, **Indrasthan** (heavenly abode), **Upvaat** (wind), and **Prachaya** (common) - with the **Tiryanchanupurvi** (animal) **Prakriti** and reducing it, the **Chaubis** (24) **Prakriti** **Udayasthan** (place of origin) of a **Sharirastha** (body-bound) **Ekendriya** (one-sense) being is formed.

Here, multiplying the aforementioned five **Bhangs** with **Prachaya** results in ten **Bhangs**. When considering the **Vaikriya** (transformed) body of a **Vayukaayik** (air-bodied) being, the **Vaikriya** body arises in place of the **Audarik** body. Therefore, there are also 24 **Prakritis** arising with its **Vaikriya** body.  One should describe its **Kevand** (body), **Badar**, **Paryapta**, **Prachaya**, and **Ayesha Kirti** **Prakritis**. Thus, there is one **Bhang** in comparison to this.

The **Tejaskayik** (fire-bodied) and **Vayukaayik** beings do not have **Prachaya** and **Yasha Kirti**. Therefore, **Vayukaayik** is not considered to have **Bhangs** in comparison to these. Thus, there are a total of eleven **Bhangs** in the **Chaubis** **Prakriti** **Udayasthan**.

After the body becomes **Paryapta** due to **Paryapti**, by adding the **Paraghat** (destructive) **Prakriti** to the **Chaubis** **Prakriti** **Udayasthan**, the **Panchavis** (25) **Prakriti** **Udayasthan** is formed. Here, the **Badar** **Prachaya** and **Yasha...**

## Chapter 7: Seven Decades

There are four types of **bhang** (break) due to **kiriti** (fame) and **ayash** (infamy), with two **bhang** for each **sukshma** (subtle) and **sadharan** (ordinary) in relation to **ayash-kiriti**. This makes a total of six **bhang**. When a **badar** (cloud) **vayukayik** (air-bodied) being, who is performing **vaikriya** (transformation) of the body, becomes **paryapt** (sufficient) in **sharira** (body), then the **uday** (emergence) of twenty-five **prakriti** (principles) occurs due to the addition of **paradhat** (secondary) to the twenty-four **prakriti**. This constitutes one **bhang**. Thus, there are a total of seven **bhang** in the **udayasthan** (place of emergence) of twenty-five **prakriti**.

Subsequently, when a being becomes **paryapt** in **pranapan** (inhalation-exhalation), the **udayasthan** of twenty-six **prakriti** occurs due to the addition of **ucchavas** (exhalation) to the aforementioned twenty-five **prakriti**. Here too, there are six **bhang** as before. Alternatively, for a being who becomes **paryapt** in **sharira** but does not experience the **uday** of **ucchavas**, but instead experiences the **uday** of either **atap** (heat) or **udyot** (glow), the **udayasthan** of twenty-six **prakriti** occurs. Here too, there are six **bhang**. These are as follows:

The **uday** of **atap** and **udyot** occurs only in **badar**, not in **sukshma**. Therefore, there are four **bhang** for each **sadharan** and **sukshma** in relation to **yash-kiriti** and **ayash-kiriti** along with **udyot** and **badar**. There are two **bhang** for each **yash-kiriti** and **ayash-kiriti** in relation to **atap** and each **badar**. This makes a total of six **bhang**.

The **uday** of **atap** occurs only in **badar** **prithvikayik** (earth-bodied) beings, but the **uday** of **udyot** occurs in **vanaspatikayik** (plant-bodied) beings as well. When a **badar** **vayukayik** being performs **vaikriya** of the body and becomes **paryapt** in **ucchavas**, the **udayasthan** of twenty-six **prakriti** occurs due to the addition of **ucchavas** to the twenty-five **prakriti**. This constitutes one **bhang**.

It is important to understand that **agnikayik** (fire-bodied) and **vayukayik** beings do not experience the **uday** of **atap**, **udyot**, or **yash-kiriti**. Thus, there are a total of thirteen **bhang** in the **udayasthan** of twenty-six **prakriti**.

## Sixth Karma Granth

The twenty-sixth natural उदयस्थान (state of existence) arises when one of the natures of Ātap and Udyot is added to the twenty-five natural उदयस्थान, which is achieved through the पर्याप्ति (sufficiency) of Prāṇāpāna (life force). Here too, there are six भंग (divisions), which have been explained in the twenty-fifth natural उदयस्थान in conjunction with one of the natures of Ātap and Udyot.

Thus, the total number of भंग for the five उदयस्थान of the एकेन्द्रिय (one-sensed) beings is 5 + 11 + 7 + 13 + 6 = 42. This is also mentioned in the संग्नह गाथा (collected verse):

"एगिषयउवएस पंच य एक्कार सत्त तेरस या।
छपकं कमसो भंगा बायला हंति सम्घ वि।"

Meaning: The five उदयस्थान of the एकेन्द्रिय, which are 21, 24, 25, 26, and 27 natural उदयस्थान, have 5, 11, 7, 13, and 6 भंग respectively, and their total sum is 42.

Having described the उदयस्थान of the एकेन्द्रिय तिर्यंच (one-sensed animals), we now proceed to describe the उदयस्थान of the विकलत्रिक (partially developed) and पंचेन्द्रिय (five-sensed) तिर्यंच.

The द्वीन्द्रिय (two-sensed) beings have six उदयस्थान, which are 21, 26, 28, 29, 30, and 31 natural उदयस्थान.

The twenty-first natural उदयस्थान arises when one of the nine natures, namely तिर्य चगति (animal path), तिर्यंचानुपूर्वी (animal-like past), द्वीन्द्रियजाति (two-sensed species), स (being), बादर (stupid), पर्याप्त (sufficient), अपर्याप्त (insufficient), दुर्भग (unfortunate), अनादेय (unworthy of respect), यक्ष:कीति (fame of a Yaksha), and अयश कीति (infamy), is added to the twelve ध्रुवोदय (fixed) natures of नामकर्म (karma of name), which were previously mentioned. This उदयस्थान belongs to the जीव (soul) existing in the अपान्तराल (intermediate state) of भव (existence). There are three भंग here, because अपर्याप्त

1. तेजस (energy), कार्मण (karmic), अगुरुलघु (heavy-light), स्थिर (stable), अस्थिर (unstable), शुभ (auspicious), अशुभ (inauspicious), वर्णचतुक (four colors), and
2. निर्माण (creation), these twelve natures are ध्रुव (fixed) in relation to उदय (arising).

## Chapter 71

When there is an emergence of **ayasha-kirti** (negative fame), then there is a **bhang** (break) in the **yasha-kirti** (positive fame) and **ayasha-kirti** (negative fame) which are **paryapt** (sufficient). Therefore, there are two **bhang** (breaks) in these two. Thus, there are a total of three **bhang** (breaks) in the twenty-one **prakritik** (natural) **udayasthan** (stages of emergence).

In these twenty-one **prakritik** (natural) **udayasthan** (stages of emergence), when **audarik** (material) **sharira** (body), **audarik** (material) **angopang** (limbs), **indriyasansthan** (sense organs), **sevartsanhanan** (service and support), **upghat** (destruction), and each of these six **prakritis** (principles) are combined and **tiryachanupurvi** (transmigration) is reduced, then there are twenty-six **prakritik** (natural) **udayasthan** (stages of emergence) for the **sharirastha** (body-bound) **hondriya** (having sense organs) **jiva** (being). Here too, there are three **bhang** (breaks) similar to the **bhang** (breaks) in the twenty-one **prakritik** (natural) **udayasthan** (stages of emergence).

In the twenty-six **prakritik** (natural) **udayasthan** (stages of emergence), when **sharira** (body) is **paryapt** (sufficient) and **paryapt** (sufficient) for the **dwindriya** (two-sense organ) **jiva** (being), then by adding the two **prakritis** (principles) of **aprashasht vihayogati** (unpleasant path of liberation) and **paradhat** (external destruction), there are twenty-eight **prakritik** (natural) **udayasthan** (stages of emergence). Here, there are two **bhang** (breaks) in comparison to **yasha-kirti** (positive fame) and **ayasha-kirti** (negative fame). Since there is no emergence of **aparyapt** (insufficient) **nama** (name), there is no **bhang** (break) in comparison to it.

After that, when **shwasocchvas** (breathing) is **paryapt** (sufficient) and **paryapt** (sufficient), then by adding the **prakriti** (principle) of **uchchvas** (exhalation) to the aforementioned twenty-eight **prakritik** (natural) **udayasthan** (stages of emergence), there are twenty-six **prakritik** (natural) **udayasthan** (stages of emergence). Here too, there are two **bhang** (breaks) in comparison to **yasha-kirti** (positive fame) and **ayasha-kirti** (negative fame). Or, when there is an emergence of **udyot** (effort) for the **jiva** (being) whose **sharira** (body) is **paryapt** (sufficient) and **paryapt** (sufficient), then there are twenty-six **prakritik** (natural) **udayasthan** (stages of emergence) without **uchchvas** (exhalation). Here too, there are two **bhang** (breaks) in comparison to **yasha-kirti** (positive fame) and **ayasha-kirti** (negative fame). Thus, there are a total of four **bhang** (breaks) in the twenty-six **prakritik** (natural) **udayasthan** (stages of emergence).

When **bhasha** (speech) is **paryapt** (sufficient) and **paryapt** (sufficient) for the **jiva** (being) with **uchchvas** (exhalation) in the twenty-six **prakritis** (principles), then by adding one of **suswar** (good voice) and **duhswar** (bad voice), there are thirty **prakritik** (natural) **udayasthan** (stages of emergence). Here, there are four **bhang** (breaks) due to the alternative of **suswar** (good voice) and **duhswar** (bad voice) and **yasha-kirti** (positive fame) and **ayasha-kirti** (negative fame). Or, when there is no emergence of **swar** (voice) for the **jiva** (being) whose **pranapan** (inhalation and exhalation) is **paryapt** (sufficient) and **paryapt** (sufficient), then...

## Sixth Karma Granth

If the **Udyot** arises in place of the **30th Prakrutik Udayasthan**, there are still 30 **Prakrutik Udayasthan**. Here, there are two **Bhang** due to the alternatives of **Yasha-niti** and **Ayasha-kirti**. Thus, there are six **Bhang** in the 30 **Prakrutik Udayasthan**.

After that, when **Udyot** is added to the 30 **Prakrutik Udayasthan** along with **Swar**, there are 31 **Prakrutik Udayasthan**. Here, there are four **Bhang** due to the alternatives of **Suswar** and **Dushwar**, and **Yasha-kirti** and **Ayasha-kirti**.

Thus, in the six **Udayasthan** (21, 26, 28, 29, 30, and 31 **Prakrutik**) of **Dwi-indriya** beings, there are a total of 22 **Bhang**, namely 3+3+2+4+6+4. Similarly, one should calculate the six **Udayasthan** and their **Bhang** for each of the **Tri-indriya** and **Chatur-indriya** beings. That is, just like **Dwi-indriya** beings, one should understand the **Prakrutik Udayasthan** and their **Bhang** for **Tri-indriya** and **Chatur-indriya** beings, but with the difference that instead of **Dwi-indriya** species, one should mention **Tri-indriya** species for **Tri-indriya** beings and **Chatur-indriya** species for **Chatur-indriya** beings.

In total, there are 66 **Bhang** for **Vikal-trika** beings. It is also said:

_Sing Tig Dug Bau Ch Chaw Vigsaap Ashtti Hor Sihan Pi._

That is, there are six **Udayasthan** namely 21, 26, 28, 29, 30, and 31 **Prakrutik** for each of **Dwi-indriya** and so on, and their **Bhang** are 3, 3, 2, 4, 6, and 4 respectively, which add up to 22, and the total for all three is 2243 = 66 **Bhang**.

Now, we will explain the **Udayasthan** of **Tiryach Pancha-indriya** beings. There are six **Udayasthan** for **Tiryach Pancha-indriya** beings, namely 21, 26, 28, 29, 30, and 31 **Prakrutik**. 

Page #204:
---------------------------
From these six उदयस्थानs, 21 natural उदयस्थानs are formed by combining the twelve ध्रुवोदया प्रकृतिs of नामकर्म with one of the following: तिर्यंचगति, तिर्यचानुपूर्वी, पंचेन्द्रिय जाति, स, बादर, पर्याप्त and अपर्याप्त; one of सुभग and दुभंग; one of आदेय and अनादेय; and one of यशःकीति and अयशः कीर्ति. This उदयस्थान is of the तिर्यच पंचेन्द्रिय existing in अपान्तराल. It has nine भंगs. Because in the उदय of पर्याप्त नामकर्म, there are 2x2x2=8 भंगs due to the उदय of one of सुभग and दुभंग, one of आदेय and अनादेय, and one of यशः कीर्ति and अयशःकीति. And in the उदय of अपर्याप्त नामकर्म, there is one भंग due to the उदय of the three inauspicious प्रकृतिs: दुभंग, अनादेय, and अयशः कीर्ति.

Thus, there are a total of nine भंगs in the 21 natural उदयस्थानs.

Some आचार्यs believe that सुभग is always accompanied by आदेय and दुर्भग by अनादेय. In essence, there are four भंगs in the उदय of पर्याप्त नामकर्म due to the combination of these two and अयश कीर्ति, and one भंग for अपर्याप्त. Thus, there are a total of five भंगs in the 21 natural उदयस्थानs. Similarly, one should understand the difference in भंगs in the subsequent उदयस्थानs according to different opinions.

Therefore, according to this opinion, the यशःकीर्ति...

## Chapter 6: Karma-Manas

**167**

There are 26 natural places of arising (**prakritik udaysthan**) within the body, which are the five senses. These 26 natural places of arising are formed by combining six natures:

* **Audarik Sharira** (physical body)
* **Audarik Angopang** (physical limbs)
* **One of the six Sansthan** (places of attachment)
* **One of the six Sanhanan** (places of accumulation)
* **Upghat** (obstacles)
* **Pratyek** (individual)

These six natures are combined, and the **Tiryanch-anupurvi** (animalistic tendencies) are removed, resulting in 26 natural places of arising.

There are 286 **bhang** (breakdowns) of these 26 natural places of arising. This is because the number of **bhang** is calculated by multiplying the number of **Sansthan**, **Sanhanan**, and the three pairs of **Subhag** (auspicious) and **Durbhag** (inauspicious) together: 6 x 6 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 288. However, since the **Hund-Sansthan** (inferior place of attachment), **Sevat Sanhanan** (inferior place of accumulation), **Durbhag**, **Anadeya** (unavoidable), and **Ayash-Kirti** (bad reputation) are not present, one **bhang** is removed. Therefore, there are a total of 286 **bhang** for the 26 natural places of arising.

For a being who is **paryapt** (sufficient) in **Sharira** (body), there are 28 natural places of arising. This is because the 26 natural places of arising are combined with two more natures: **Paraghat** (extreme obstacles) and **Prashasht** (auspicious) or **A-prashasht** (inauspicious) **Vihayogati** (path of liberation). The number of **bhang** for these 28 natural places of arising is 576. This is calculated by multiplying the 288 **bhang** for the **paryapt** state with the two **Vihayogati**: 288 x 2 = 576.

When **Uchch-vas** (high breath) is added to these 28 natural places of arising, the total becomes 29. The number of **bhang** remains the same, 576. Alternatively, for a being who is **paryapt** in **Sharira**, **Uchch-vas** does not arise. Therefore, **Udyot** (illumination) is added instead, resulting in 26 natural places of arising. The number of **bhang** remains the same, 576. Therefore, the total number of **bhang** for the 26 natural places of arising is 576 + 576 = 1152.

For a being who is **paryapt** in **Bhasha** (speech), there are 29 natural places of arising...

## Chapter on Sapta-Tika

When one of the two, **su-svara** (good tone) or **du-svara** (bad tone), is combined with the **Jiva**, there are 30 **prakritik** (natural) **udayasthan** (stages of emergence). These have 1152 **bhang** (divisions). Because 576 **bhang** are mentioned for the **uccha** (high) and **vasa** (low) of the first 29 **prakritik** stages, multiplying them by **svara-dvik** (two tones) gives 1152 **bhang**. Alternatively, when **udyot** (effort) is added to the 26 **prakritik** **udayasthan** mentioned for the **Jiva** who has attained **pranapan** (inhalation-exhalation) and **paryapti** (fulfillment), it results in 30 **prakritik** **udayasthan**. This also has 576 **bhang** like before. Thus, the total **bhang** for 30 **prakritik** **udayasthan** are 1728.

When **udyot** is added to the 30 **prakritik** **udayasthan** including **svara**, it becomes 31 **prakritik** **udayasthan**. This has a total of 1152 **bhang**. Because the 1152 **bhang** mentioned for the 30 **prakritik** **udayasthan** including **svara** are the same here.

Therefore, the total **udayasthan** and their **bhang** for the six **udayasthan** of the ordinary **tiryanch** (animal) **panchendriya** (five senses) are 286 + 576 + 1152 + 1728 + 1152 = 4606.

Now, we will discuss the **bandha-sthan** (binding places) and their **bhang** for the **tiryanch** **panchendriya** with **vaikriya** (changeable) body. The **tiryanch** **panchendriya** with **vaikriya** body have five **udayasthan** of 25, 27, 28, 26, and 30 **prakritik**.

When **vaikriya** body, **vaikriya** **angopaang** (changeable limbs), **sama-chatur-astra** (square) **sansthan** (structure), **upghat** (injury), and each of these five **prakriti** are added to the 21 **prakritik** **udayasthan** mentioned for the ordinary **tiryanch** **panchendriya** and the **tiryanch** **anupurvi** (animal lineage) is removed, it results in 25 **prakritik** **udayasthan**. In this 25 **prakritik** **udayasthan**, one of **su-bhang** (good division) or **du-bhang** (bad division), one of **adeya** (worthy of being given) or **ana-adeya** (not worthy of being given), and one of **yasha-kiriti** (fame and glory) or **ayasha-kiriti** (infamy and disgrace) are added.

Sixth Karma Granth
Due to the arising of one of them, there are 2x22 = 8 bhangs.
After that, when the two natures of the paragahat of the jiva who has become sufficient by the body sufficiency and the prashastha vihayogati are added to the 25 natural udaysthanas, there are 27 natural udayas. Here also, there are 8 bhangs as before.
When the ucchvasa nature of the jiva who has become sufficient by the pranapan sufficiency is added to the above 27 natural udayasthana, there are 28 natural udayasthana. Here also, there are eight bhangs as before. Or if the udyot arises for the jiva who has become sufficient by the body sufficiency, then also there are 28 natural udayasthana, here also there are eight bhangs. Thus, there are sixteen bhangs of 28 natural udayasthana.
After that, when the susvara is added to the 28 natures including the ucchvasa of the jiva who has become sufficient by the language sufficiency, there are 26 natural udayasthana. Here also, there are eight bhangs. Or when the udyot is added to the 28 natures including the ucchvasa of the jiva who has become sufficient by the pranapan sufficiency, there are also 26 natural udayasthana. It also has eight bhangs. Thus, there are a total of sixteen bhangs of 21 natural udayasthana.
After that, when the udyot is added to the 26 natural udayasthana including the susvara, there are 30 natural udayasthana. It also has eight bhangs.
Thus, the total udayasthana of the panchendriya tiryanchas who do the back body are 25, 27, 28, 26 and 30 natural and their total bhangs are 8+6+16+16+656. When these 56 bhangs are added to the 4606 bhangs of the general panchendriya tiryancha, there are 4962 bhangs of the total udayasthana of all the tiryanchas.

## Chapter 170: The Seventies

Having explained the different types of births and their destructions for the one-sensed to the five-sensed beings, we now discuss the births and destructions in relation to the human realm.

The births of humans are categorized differently depending on whether they are ordinary humans, those who have a **Vākriya** body, those who have an **Āhārika** body, and those who are **Kevala-jñānī** (omniscient).

**Ordinary Humans:** Ordinary humans have five types of births: 25, 26, 28, 29, and 30 **Prakṛtis**. These births should be understood in the same way as the births of the one-sensed to the five-sensed beings, with the following exceptions:

* Instead of **Tiryag-gati** (animal realm) and **Tiryag-anupūrvi** (previous birth in the animal realm), we should say **Manushya-gati** (human realm) and **Manushya-anupūrvi** (previous birth in the human realm).
* The 29th and 30th **Prakṛti** births should be considered **Udyota-rahita** (without **Udyota**), as **Udyota** does not arise in humans except for those who have **Vākriya** and **Āhārika** bodies.

Therefore, instead of the 1152 destructions of the 26th **Prakṛti** birth in the animal realm, humans have only 576 destructions. Similarly, instead of the 1728 destructions of the 30th **Prakṛti** birth in the animal realm, humans have only 1152 destructions.

In total, the five types of births for ordinary humans have 2602 destructions: 576 + 576 + 576 + 1152 + 576 = 2602.

**Humans with a Vākriya Body:** Humans with a **Vākriya** body have five types of births: 25, 27, 28, 29, and 30 **Prakṛtis**. Along with the twelve **Dhṛuva-udaya** **Prakṛtis**, these births are further categorized based on:

* **Manushya-gati** (human realm)
* **Panchendriya-jāti** (five-sensed beings)
* **Vākriya-śarīra** (**Vākriya** body)
* **Vākriya-angopānga** (**Vākriya** limbs)
* **Sama-chatur-astra** (four-sided)
* **Sansthāna** (structure)
* **Upghāta** (injury)
* **Tras** (fear)
* **Bādar** (obstruction)
* **Paryāpta** (sufficient)
* **Prati-ek** (each)
* **Subhaga** (auspicious)
* **Dubhaga** (inauspicious)
* **Ādeya** (worthy of respect)
* **Anādeya** (unworthy of respect)
* **Yaśa-kīrti** (fame and glory)
* **A-yaśa-kīrti** (infamy and disgrace)

## Sixth Karma Granthya

One, when these thirteen natures are combined, there arises the 25-natured state of existence. Here, the emergence of auspicious and inauspicious, worthy and unworthy, and glorious and infamous occurs by choice. Therefore, there are eight bhangas (divisions) - 24, 24, 28. For those who are desavrata (free from worldly attachments) and restrained, the emergence of auspicious natures occurs in their bhancriya (physical) body.

When the two natures of paragahat (destruction) and prashasta vihayogati (liberation) are combined with the 25-natured state of existence, which is attained through the fulfillment of the body, there arises the 27-natured state of existence. Here too, there are eight bhangas, just like the 25-natured state of existence.

Subsequently, when the uccahvas (exhalation) is combined with the 28-natured state of existence, which is attained through the fulfillment of pranapan (inhalation and exhalation), there arises the 28-natured state of existence. Here too, there are eight bhangas. Alternatively, when the udyot (radiance) is combined with the aforementioned 25-natured state of existence, which is attained through the fulfillment of the body by restrained beings who have a bhancriya body, there arises the 28-natured state of existence. Since restrained beings do not experience the emergence of the three inauspicious natures - inauspicious, unworthy, and infamous - there is only one bhang. Thus, there are a total of nine bhangas in the 28-natured state of existence.

When the susvara (good voice) is combined with the 28-natured state of existence, there arises the 29-natured state of existence. Here too, there are eight bhangas. Alternatively, when the udyot is combined with the 29-natured state of existence in place of the susvara of restrained beings, there is only one bhang. Thus, there are a total of six bhangas in the 29-natured state of existence.

When the udyot karma (radiance karma) of restrained beings is combined with the 29-natured state of existence, which includes the susvara, there arises the 30-natured state of existence. There is only one bhang in this state.

## The Chapter of Seven Tika

Thus, for humans who have a **vaikriya** body, there are five **udayasthanas** with 25, 27, 28, 26, and 30 **prakritis**, respectively. These **udayasthanas** have a total of 35 **bhangas**, calculated as 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 + 1.

**172**

**Aharak** **samyats** have five **udayasthanas** with 25, 27, 25, 26, and 30 **prakritis**, respectively.

The 21 **prakritis** eligible for **udaya** in the human realm were previously mentioned. By combining these with the five **prakritis** of **aaharaka** body, **aaharaka** limbs, **samachaturasra** **samsthana**, **upghata**, and **pratyek**, and reducing the **manushyanupurvi**, we arrive at the **udayastana** of 25 **prakritis**. During the **aaharaka** body, only **prashasta** **prakritis** arise, as the **aprashasta** **prakritis** of **duhbhang**, **dusvara**, and **ayashah** **kiriti** do not arise for **aaharaka** **samyats**. Therefore, there is only one **bhang** here.

Subsequently, in the aforementioned **udayastana** of 25 **prakritis**, the body is sufficient.

**1** In the **karmakanda**, the **vaikriya** body and **vaikriya** limbs are mentioned for gods and hell beings, but not for humans and animals. Therefore, here, the **udayasthanas** and their **bhangas** for humans are not mentioned in relation to the **vaikriya** body. For the same reason, the **udayasthanas** and their **bhangas** for **vayukaayika** and **panchendriya** animals are not mentioned in relation to the **vaikriya** body. Although the **udayaprayogya** **namakarma** **bandha** **prakritis** for one-sense beings, etc., are not mentioned in this chapter of seven **tika**, the commentary suggests that the **vaikriya** body and **vaikriya** limbs are included in the **prakritis** eligible for **udaya** in the realm of gods and hell beings. This indicates that the **vaikriya** body and **vaikriya** limbs should not arise for animals and humans. However, the verse in the **udirana** chapter of **karmaprakriti** supports the fact that these two **prakritis** arise and are **udirana** for animals and humans as well, to the best of their ability.

When the two natures of *parāghāt* (extreme suffering) and *praśasta vihāyoga* (excellent liberation) of a living being are combined, there arises the 27th *prakṛti* (nature) *udayasthan* (stage of development). Here also there is only one *bhaṅga* (break).
When the *śarīra* (body) *paryāpti* (perfection) of a living being who has attained *paryāpta* (perfection) is combined with *ucchvāsa nābha* (exhalation and navel), the 28th *prakṛti* *udayasthan* arises. This also has only one *bhaṅga*. Or, when the *śarīra* *paryāpti* of a living being who has attained *paryāpta* is combined with *udyota* (radiance) in the aforementioned 27th *prakṛti* *udayasthan*, the 28th *prakṛti* *udayasthan* arises. This also has one *bhaṅga*. Thus, there are two *bhaṅga*s of the 28th *prakṛti* *udayasthan*.
Thereafter, when the *bhāṣā* (speech) *paryāpti* of a living being who has attained *paryāpta* is combined with *ucchvāsa* (exhalation) along with the 28th *prakṛti* *udayasthan*, the 29th *prakṛti* *udayasthan* arises. This has one *bhaṅga*. Or, when the *prāṇāpāna* (inhalation and exhalation) *paryāpti* of a living being who has attained *paryāpta* is combined with *udyota* in place of *susvara* (sweet voice), the 29th *prakṛti* *udayasthan* arises. This also has one *bhaṅga*. Thus, there are two *bhaṅga*s of the 29th *prakṛti* *udayasthan*. When the *bhāṣā* *paryāpti* of a living being who has attained *paryāpta* is combined with *susvara* (sweet voice) along with the 29th *prakṛti* *udayasthan*, the 30th *prakṛti* *udayasthan* arises. This also has one *bhaṅga*.
Thus, there are five *udayasthan*s of the *āhārak* (food) *saṃyata* (restrained) - 25th, 27th, 28th, 29th, and 30th *prakṛti* - and there are 1+1+2+2+1=7 *bhaṅga*s of these five *udayasthan*s respectively.
1. It is known from the 267th verse of the *Karmakāṇḍa* (Karma section) that the *udyota* *prakṛti* arises only for living beings up to the fifth *guṇasthāna* (stage of virtue)...
"Dase tadiyakasāya tiriyāvajjovāṇīcatiriyagadī."
And it is also known from the 286th verse that the *udyota* *prakṛti* arises only in the *tirgach* (animal) *gati* (realm).

## The Chapter of Seven

**Kevalajnani** - For Kevali beings, the ten **udayasthanas** (stages of arising) are: 20, 21, 26, 27, 18, 29, 30, 31, 6, and 8 **prakritis** (natures).

The twelve **dhruvas** (poles) of **namakarma** (karma of name) are combined with the eight **prakritis** of **manushya** (human) **gati** (path), **panchendriya** (five senses) **jati** (birth), **sa**, **badar**, **paryapt**, **subhag**, **adey**, and **yasha** (fame) **kirti** (glory) in the **daya** (mercy) **prakritis** to form the **udayasthan** of 20 **prakritis**. This has one **bhanga** (break). This **udayasthan** occurs during the **kamayog** (karma of desire) of the **atitharkar** (non-Tirthankara) **kevali**.

Adding the **tirthankara** (Tirthankara) **prakriti** to the aforementioned **udayasthan** of 20 **prakritis** results in the **udayasthan** of 21 **prakritis**. This **udayasthan** occurs during the **karmankayog** (karma of action) of the **tirthankara** **kevali**. This also has one **bhanga**.

Adding the six **prakritis** of **oudarik** (generous) **sharira** (body), one of the six **sansthanas** (institutions), **oudarik** **angopang** (limbs and organs), **vajrarishbhanaracha** (diamond bull) **sanhanan** (combination), **upghat** (destruction), and **pratyek** (individual) to the **udayasthan** of 20 **prakritis** results in the **udayasthan** of 26 **prakritis**. This occurs during the **oudarik mishra kayyog** (karma of mixed generosity) of the **atitharkar** **kevali**. There are six **bhangas** corresponding to the six **sansthanas**, but they are not counted separately as they are also possible in the **udayasthanas** of ordinary humans.

**Teitigunatiritikhe sujjovo badare**
**Pune**

The **karmakanda** (karma ritual) mentions four **udayasthanas** of 25, 27, 20, and 26 **prakritis** for **aaharaka** (food-consuming) **sanyata** (restrained). The **udayasthanas** of 24 and 27 **prakritis** should be understood according to the **saptatika** (sevenfold) chapter. The remaining **udayasthanas** of 28 and 26 **prakritis**, the **udayasthan** of 26 **prakritis** arises from the **uday** (arising) of the **uchchhvas** (exhalation) **prakriti**, and the **udayasthan** of 26 **prakritis** arises from the **uday** of the **suswar** (good voice) **prakriti**. In other words, adding the **uchchhvas** **prakriti** to the **udayasthan** of 27 **prakritis** results in the **udayasthan** of 28 **prakritis**, and adding the **suswar** **prakriti** to this **udayasthan** of 28 **prakritis** results in the **udayasthan** of 26 **prakritis**.

26. When the Tirthankara nature is added to the 26 natural states of existence, it becomes 27 natural states of existence. This state occurs during the time of the Tirthankara Kevali's Audarik Kayyoga. Since only the Samchaturasra Sansthan arises in this state of existence, there is only one Bhang.
27. When one of the four natures, namely Paradhat Ucchhvas, Prashast Vihayogati, and Aprashast Vihayogati, and one of the two natures, namely Suswar and Duswar, are added to the aforementioned 26 natural states of existence, it becomes 30 natural states of existence. This state occurs during the time of the Atirthankara Sayogi Kevali's Audarik Kayyoga. Here, there are 6 x 2 x 2 = 24 Bhangs due to the six Sansthans, Prashast and Aprashast Vihayogati, and Suswar and Duswar. However, these are obtained in the states of existence of ordinary humans, so they are not counted separately.
28. When the Tirthankara nature is added to the 30 natural states of existence, it becomes 31 natural states of existence. This occurs during the time of the Tirthankara Sayogikevali's Audarik Kayyoga. When the Tirthankara Kevali suppresses Vakyog, their voice does not arise, so removing one nature from the aforementioned 31 natural states of existence results in 30 natural states of existence for the Tirthankara Kevali. When they suppress Ucchhvas, Ucchhvas does not arise, so reducing Ucchhvas results in 26 natural states of existence. However, the Atirthankara Kevali does not experience the Tirthankara nature, so removing the Tirthankara nature from the aforementioned 30 and 26 natural states of existence results in 26 natural states of existence for the Atirthankara Kevali when they suppress Vachanyog and 28 natural states of existence when they suppress Ucchhvas. In these two states of existence of the Atirthankara Kevali, there are six Sansthans and Prashast and Aprashast Vihayogati, resulting in

## Chapter 70

There are 12,12 bhangas. However, they are not counted separately because they are possible in the realms of ordinary humans.

In the natural realm, there are nine types of births: human, five-sense beings, as, badar, paryapta, subhaga, adeya, yasha-kirti, and tirthankara. These nine natural realms are attained in the ayojika-kevali gunasthan of a tirthankara. If we subtract the tirthankara nature from this realm, we are left with eight natural realms. This is the realm of an atirthankara kevali in the ayojika-kevali gunasthan.

Here, in the realms of the kevali, there is one special bhang in each of these eight realms: 20, 21, 27, 26, 30, 31, 6, and 8. Therefore, there are eight bhangas. Of these, two bhangas in the realms of 20 (prashika) and 21 (nik) are of the atirthankara kevali, while the remaining six bhangas are of the tirthankara kevali.

Thus, the total number of bhangas related to the realms of all humans is 2602 + 35 + 7 + 8 = 2652.

Now, we will discuss the realms of the gods and their bhangas.

There are six natural realms of the gods: 21, 25, 27, 28, 26, and 30.

In the twelve types of dhruvodaya of name-karma, there is one each from the following nine types: devagati, dev-anupurvi, five-sense beings, as, badar, paryapta, subhaga, durbhaga, one each from adeya and anadeya, and one each from yasha-kirti and ayasha-kirti. When these nine types are combined, we get 21 types. 

In the realm of the kevali, there is one special bhang in each of the following eight realms: 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28. These are eight bhangas. Of these, two bhangas in the realms of 21 and 22 are of the atirthankara kevali, while the remaining six bhangas are of the tirthankara kevali.

The **Pashta Karmagranthi** is the **Udayasthan** (place of arising). The arising of **Durbhang**, **Anadeya**, and **Ayash:koti** (demerit) in the Devas (gods) should be understood in relation to the **Pishacha** (ghosts) and other Devas. Here, there are 24242 possibilities arising from the combination of one each from **Subhag** (auspicious) and **Durbhag** (inauspicious), **Adeya** (worthy of respect) and **Anadeya** (unworthy of respect), and **Yash:kiriti** (fame) and **Ayash:kirti** (infamy).

In these 21 **Prakriti** (nature) **Udayasthan**, by combining the five **Prakriti** of **Daikiya** (physical) body, **Vaikriya** (mental) body, **Upghat** (injury), **Pratyek** (individual), and **Samachaturasra** (square) and removing **Devgatyānupūrvi** (divine progression), there are 25 **Prakriti** **Udayasthan** for the **Sharirastha Deva** (body-dwelling god). Here, there are eight **Bhang** (types of arising) as before.

Further, by combining the two **Prakriti** of **Paraghāt** (extreme injury) and **Prashastha Vihayogati** (excellent liberation path) in the 25 **Prakriti** **Udayasthan**, there are 27 **Prakriti** **Udayasthan** for the **Sharira Paryāpti** (body-fulfilled) Devas. Here, there are eight **Bhang** as before. The **Aprashastha Vihayogati** (non-excellent liberation path) does not arise in the Devas, so the **Tanniमित्तक Bhang** (arising due to that) is not mentioned.

Further, by adding the **Uchchhvās** (exhalation) of the **Desha** (country) to the 27 **Prakriti** **Udayasthan** of the **Prāṇāpāna Paryāpti** (life-breath fulfilled) Devas, there are 28 **Prakriti** **Udayasthan**. Here, there are eight **Bhang** as before. Alternatively, by adding **Udyot** (illumination) to the 27 **Prakriti** **Udayasthan** of the **Sharira Paryāpti** (body-fulfilled) Devas, there are 28 **Prakriti** **Udayasthan**. Here, there are eight **Bhang**. Thus, there are a total of 16 **Bhang** in the 28 **Prakriti** **Udayasthan**.

By adding **Susvara** (good voice) to the 15 **Prakriti** **Udayasthan** of the **Bhāṣā Paryāpti** (speech-fulfilled) Jiva (living being) along with **Uchchhvās** (exhalation), there are 26 **Prakriti** **Udayasthan**. Here, there are eight **Bhang** as before. The **Dushthara Prakriti** (difficult nature) does not arise in the Devas, so the **Tanniमित्तक Bhang** (arising due to that) is not mentioned here. Alternatively, by adding **Uchchhvās** (exhalation) to the **Prāṇāpāna Paryāpti** (life-breath fulfilled) Jiva...

## Chapter on Saptaatika

**26 Natural Udayasthanas:** When Udyot is added to the 28 natural Udayasthanas, it becomes 26 natural Udayasthanas. The emergence of this name occurs during the time of Uttarvikriya. Here too, there are eight Bhangas as before. Thus, there are a total of 16 Bhangas in 26 natural Udayasthanas.

**30 Natural Udayasthanas:** When Udyot is added to the 26 natural Udayasthanas, along with the sufficient language and melodious voices of the Devas, it becomes 30 natural Udayasthanas. Here too, there are eight Bhangas.

**Six Udayasthanas of Devas:** Thus, there are six Udayasthanas of Devas: 21, 25, 27, 28, 26, and 30. They have 8+6+6+16+16+8 = 64 Bhangas respectively.

**Udayasthanas of Narakas:** Now, we will discuss the Udayasthanas of Narakas and their Bhangas.

**Five Udayasthanas of Narakas:** There are five Udayasthanas of Narakas: 21, 25, 27, 28, and 26. Here, when the nine natural qualities of Narakagati, Narakanupurvi, Panchendriya jati, Tras, Badar, Paryapt, Dubhang, Anadeya, and Ayash Kirti are added to the 12 natural qualities of Dhruvodaya, it becomes 21 natural Udayasthanas. All the unrefined natural qualities of Narakas are present here, therefore there is only one Bhang.

**25 Natural Udayasthanas:** After removing Narakanupurvi and adding the five natural qualities of Vaikriya Sharira, Vaikriya Angopaang, Hundasanasthan, Upghāt, and Pratyek, it becomes 25 natural Udayasthanas for the Narakas residing in the body. Here too, there is only one Bhang.

**27 Natural Udayasthanas:** When the two natural qualities of Parāghāt and Aprāśast Vihāyogati are added to the 25 natural Udayasthanas of Narakas who have attained sufficient body, it becomes 27 natural Udayasthanas. This also has only one Bhang.

## Sixth Karma Granth

After the attainment of the sufficient number of breaths (pranapana paryapti) in the 27 natural states of hell (narak), the addition of exhalation (ucchavas) results in the 28th natural state. Here too, there is only one break (bhang).

After the attainment of the sufficient number of breaths (pranapana paryapti) in the 28 natural states of the living being (jiv), the addition of a bad voice (duswar) results in the 29th natural state. This also has one break.

In this way, there are five natural states for the hell beings (narak): 21, 25, 27, 28, and 29. And with one break for each of these five, there are a total of five breaks.

So far, the total number of breaks for the states of existence (udayasthan) from the one-sense (ekendriya) of name karma to the hell beings (narak) is 42 + 66 + 4962 ÷ 2652 + 64 + 5 = 7761.

After describing the states of existence (udayasthan) and breaks (bhang) of name karma, we now consider the breaks of each state of existence in two verses.

**Verse 27:**

* **Ega:** One
* **Biyalekkaras:** Forty-one
* **Tetisa:** Thirty
* **Chhatyagi:** Six hundred
* **Tetisa:** Thirty-three
* **Barasaptarasasayahigani:** Twelve hundred and seventeen hundred more
* **Bivaseehi:** Two hundred and eighty
* **Do:** And
* **Panchasi:** Fifty

**Verse 28:**

* **Aunatti:** Nineteen
* **Sevakar:** Eleven
* **Sasyahiga:** One thousand and one hundred more
* **Sataraspanchasatthihi:** Seventeen and sixty-five
* **Iveksek:** One-one
* **Gosavatesu:** From the twenty natural states of existence to the eight natural states
* **Vayavihi:** Breaks of existence

## Chapter on Sevenfold Divisions

**Summary:** From the origination of the 20th nature to the origination of the 8th nature, there are 1, 42, 11, 33, 600, 33, 1202, 1785, 2617, 1165, 1, and 1 destructions respectively. 

**Specific Explanation:** Previously, 12 originations of nature were explained, namely the 20th, 21st, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st, 6th, and 8th natures, along with the number of originations and destructions in each state of existence. Now, we will explain the number of destructions for each of these originations.

The 20th nature has one destruction, which occurs for the Arhat who is free from all karmas. The 21st nature has 42 destructions. These can be understood as follows: 5 for the one-sensed beings, 6 for the two-sensed beings, 8 for the five-sensed beings, 8 for humans, 1 for Tirthankaras, 6 for gods, and 1 for hell beings. The total of these is 5 + 6 + 8 + 8 + 1 + 6 + 1 = 42.

The 24th nature occurs only for the one-sensed beings, not for others.

**Note:** The *Karmakanda* verses 603-605 mention the destructions of these 20 natures as 1, 60, 27, 16, 620, 12, 1175, 1760, 2621, 1161, 1, and 1 respectively. The total of these is 7758.

**Verse:** "The destructions of the twenty natures are as follows: one, sixty, twenty-seven, sixteen, six hundred and twenty, twelve, eleven hundred and seventy-five, seventeen hundred and sixty, twenty-six hundred and twenty-one, eleven hundred and sixty-one, one, and one."

## The Book of Karma (Pashta Karmagrantha)
### Chapter 151

**24 Natural Stages of Existence:**

There are 11 **bhanga** (types of karma) for each **ekendriya** (one-sensed being) in the 24 natural stages of existence. Therefore, there are 11 **bhanga** in the 24 natural stages of existence.

**25 Natural Stages of Existence:**

There are 7 **bhanga** for each **ekendriya** (one-sensed being), 8 **bhanga** for each **vaikriya** (non-natural) **tiryanch** (animal) with five senses, 8 **bhanga** for each **vaikriya** (non-natural) human, 1 **bhanga** for each **aaharaka** (those who control their diet), 8 **bhanga** for each **deva** (god), and 1 **bhanga** for each **naraka** (hell being). The total sum of these is 7 + 1 + 1 = 33. Therefore, there are 33 **bhanga** in the 25 natural stages of existence.

**26 Natural Stages of Existence:**

There are 600 **bhanga** in the 26 natural stages of existence. There are 13 **bhanga** for each **ekendriya** (one-sensed being), 6 **bhanga** for each **vikalaindriya** (impaired-sensed being), 288 **bhanga** for each **prakrut** (natural) **tiryanch** (animal) with five senses, and 286 **bhanga** for each **prakrut** (natural) human. The total sum of these is 13 + 6 + 286 + 289 = 600. These 600 **bhanga** belong to the 26 natural stages of existence.

**27 Natural Stages of Existence:**

There are 6 **bhanga** for each **ekendriya** (one-sensed being), 8 **bhanga** for each **vaikriya** (non-natural) **tiryanch** (animal) with five senses, 8 **bhanga** for each **vaikriya** (non-natural) human, 1 **bhanga** for each **aaharaka** (those who control their diet), 1 **bhanga** for each **kevali** (omniscient being), 8 **bhanga** for each **deva** (god), and 1 **bhanga** for each **naraka** (hell being). The total sum of these is 33. Therefore, there are 33 **bhanga** in the 27 natural stages of existence.

**28 Natural Stages of Existence:**

There are 6 **bhanga** for each **vikalaindriya** (impaired-sensed being), 576 **bhanga** for each **prakrut** (natural) **tiryanch** (animal) with five senses, 16 **bhanga** for each **vaikriya** (non-natural) **tiryanch** (animal) with five senses, 576 **bhanga** for each **prakrut** (natural) human, 6 **bhanga** for each **vaikriya** (non-natural) human, 2 **bhanga** for each **aaharaka** (those who control their diet), 16 **bhanga** for each **deva** (god), and 1 **bhanga** for each **naraka** (hell being). The total sum of these is 6 + 576 + 16 + 576 + 6 + 2 + 16 + 1 = 1202. Therefore, there are 1202 **bhanga** in the 28 natural stages of existence.

**29 Natural Stages of Existence:**

There are 1785 **bhanga** in the 29 natural stages of existence. There are...

**In comparison to 12, there are 1152 **Vaikriya** Tiryancha Panchendriya, 16 **Vaikriya** Manushya, 9 Aharak Samyata, 1 Tirthankara, 16 Deva, and ? Naraka. Their total is 12 + 1152 + 16 + 576 + 9 + 1 + 1 + 16 + 1 = 1785. Therefore, there are 1785 **Bhang** in 26 **Prakrutik Udayasthan**.

**In comparison to 30, there are 18 Vikalendriya, 1728 Tiryancha Panchendriya, 8 **Vaikriya** Tiryancha Panchendriya, 1152 Manushya, 1 **Vaikriya** Manushya, 1 Aharak Samyata, 1 Kali, and 8 Deva. Their total is 18 + 1728 + 8 + 1152 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 8 = 2917. Therefore, there are 2917 **Bhang** in 30 **Prakrutik Udayasthan**.

**In comparison to 31, there are 12 Vikalendriya, 1152 Tiryancha Panchendriya, and 1 Tirthankara. Their total is 1165. Therefore, there are 1165 **Bhang** in 31 **Prakrutik Udayasthan**.

**In comparison to 9, there is 1 **Bhang** for Tirthankara. In comparison to 8, there is 1 **Bhang** for Atirthankara. These have been explained previously. Therefore, there is 1 **Bhang** in 9 **Prakrutik Udayasthan** and 1 **Bhang** in 8 **Prakrutik Udayasthan**.

**Therefore, there are 1 + 42 + 11 + 33 + 600 + 33 + 1202 + 1785 + 2917 + 1165 + 1 + 1 = 7791 **Bhang** in 20 **Prakrutik Udayasthan** and the following 12 **Udayasthan**.

## The Chapter of the Seven Tika

After stating the binding and arising places of name-karma, we now state the places of existence.

**Verse 26:**

* **Tibunui:** 103
* **Ugunui:** 102
* **Atthachchalasi:** 86
* **Asoai:** 84
* **Ugusii:** 83
* **Ayappanasare:** 78
* **Nav:** 76
* **A:** 75
* **Y:** 6
* **Namasantaani:** The places of existence of name-karma.

**Explanation:**

* **Tibunui:** 103
* **Ugunui:** 102
* **Atthachchalasi:** 86
* **Asoai:** 84
* **Ugusii:** 83
* **Ayappanasare:** 78
* **Nav:** 76
* **A:** 75
* **Y:** 6
* **Namasantaani:** The places of existence of name-karma.

**Commentary:**

There are 63, 62, 66, 86, 80, 76, 78, 76, 75, 6, and 8 natural places of existence of name-karma. This verse mentions the number of natures contained within each place of existence, indicating the number of natures each place of existence possesses. This reveals that there are twelve places of existence of name-karma, and they are of 63, 62, etc. natures. However, it does not clarify the names of the natures included in each place of existence. Therefore, we will now explain the number of natures in each place of existence, along with the names of the natures included.

The first place of existence is said to have 63 natures. Since all the subsequent natures of name-karma are 63, the place of existence with 93 natures includes the 103, 102, 16, 6523, 60, 86, 84, 83, 26, and 6 natures of name-karma in the *Kammprakriti* and *Sangha Saptaatika*. These twelve places of existence are mentioned here. There is a difference between these places of existence and the places of existence with numbers like 103, etc. These places are mentioned as 15 types of bondage. The place of existence with 82 natures is mentioned in two ways. Detailed information should be obtained from there.

The names of the 13 subsequent natures of name-karma are given in the first *Karmagrantha*. They are not mentioned here due to repetition.

All the natures have been accepted. Out of these 63 natures, when the Tirthankara nature is reduced, there are 62 natures. Out of the 63 natures, when the four natures of Aharak body, Aharak angopang, Aharak sanghat and Aharak bandhan are reduced, there are 59 natures. Out of these 59 natures, when the Tirthankara nature is reduced, there are 58 natures.
Out of the above 88 natures, when the Narakgati and Narakanupurvi or the Devgati and Devanupurvi are destroyed, there are 86 natures. Or, when the six natures of Narakgati, Narakanupurvi, Vaikriya body, Vaikriya angopang, Vaikriya sanghat and Vaikriya bandhan are bound to a being with 80 natures who is eligible for Narakgati, there are 86 natures. Out of these 86 natures, when the six natures of Narakgati, Narakanupurvi and Vaikriya Chatushk are destroyed, there are 80 natures. Or, when the six natures of Devgati, Devanupurvi and Vaikriya Chatushk are destroyed, there are 80 natures. Out of these, when the Manushygati and Manushyanupurvi are destroyed, there are 78 natures.
The above seven natures are said with respect to Akshapaks. Now, the natures with respect to Kshapaks are being told.
Now, the Kshapak beings destroy the thirteen natures of Narakgati, Narakanupurvi, Tiryanch gati, Tich anupurvi, Jati Chatushk (Ekendriya jati, Dwiindriya jati, Triindriya jati, Chaturindriya jati), Sthavar, Atap, Udyot, Sukshma and Sadharan out of the 63 natures. Then, they have 80 natures.

Sapttatika Prakarana
There are three Sattastana. When thirteen of these twenty-two Prakruti are destroyed, then there is a 76 Prakruti Sattastana. And when thirteen of these eighty-six Prakruti are destroyed, then there is a 76 Prakruti Sattastana. And when thirteen of these eighty-five Prakruti are destroyed, then there is a 75 Prakruti Sattastana.
Now there are two more Sattastana. These two are in the final time of the Ayogikevali Gunasthan. In the nine Prakruti Sattastana, there are nine Prakruti: Manushya-Gati, Panchendriya-Jati, Tras, Badar, Paryapt, Subhag, Adesh, Yash-Kirti, and Tirthankara. When the Tirthankara Prakruti is reduced, then there is a Prakruti Sattastana.
Go. Karmakanda and Namakarm Sattastana
Previously, twelve Sattastana were mentioned according to the Gatha. But in Go. Karmakanda, 93, 62, 61, 60, 85, 84, 82, 80, 76, 78, 77, 10, and 1 Prakruti, a total of thirteen Sattastana are mentioned.
The explanation is as follows:
Here, in the 63 Prakruti Sattastana, the existence of all the Prakruti of Namakarm is considered. When the Tirthankara Prakruti is reduced, then there is a 62 Prakruti Sattastana. When the two Prakruti of Aharak-Sharira and Aharak-Angopanga are reduced, then there is a 61 Prakruti Sattastana. When the Tirthankara, Aharak-Sharira, and Aharak-Angopanga are reduced, then there is a 10 Prakruti Sattastana. From this, when the Devadvik's Uvalna Prakruti is reduced from the Sattastana, then there is a Prakruti Sattastana.
1 This is the opinion of Go. Karmakanda from the perspective of comparative study.

## Sixth Karma Granth
### 187

When the fourfold karma is agitated, there are 84 natural states of existence. When the human twofold karma is agitated, there are 82 natural states of existence.

When 13 of the 63 natural states of existence, starting with the hell twofold karma, are destroyed, there are 80 natural states of existence. When 13 of the 12 natural states of existence, starting with the uttama, are destroyed, there are 76 natural states of existence. When these same 13 natural states are reduced from the 61 natural states of existence, there are 78 natural states of existence. When these same 13 natural states are reduced from the 60 natural states of existence, there are 77 natural states of existence. The Tirthankara Aayogikevali has 10 natural states of existence, and the ordinary Kevali has 10 natural states of existence.

Thus, after explaining the states of existence of the name karma, the next verse instructs us to explain the mutual connection of the bondage, arising, and states of existence of the name karma.

**Verse 30**

**Atu ya baras baras bandhokya santpadithaanani. Ohe navase na ya jaththa jaha sambhava vibhaje.**

**Meaning:** There are eight, twelve, and twelve states of existence for the bondage, arising, and states of existence of the name karma respectively. Their flow, from the general to the specific, and where possible, should be differentiated.

**Verse Meaning:** The bondage, arising, and states of existence of the name karma are eight, twelve, and twelve respectively. Their flow, from the general to the specific, and where possible, should be differentiated.

It is necessary to consider both general and specific options.
## Saptalika Prakaran

Here, in this specific section, the binding place, arising place, and existence place of name-karma have already been explained in the previous chapter of the text. It has been stated that there are eight binding places, twelve arising places, and twelve existence places for name-karma. However, this information is being reiterated here to explain the breaking of these perceptions.
There are two ways to understand these broken perceptions: 1. **Ogh** and 2. **Aadesh**. **Ogh** is a synonym for general, and **Aadesh** is for specific. Here, **Ogh** means that in a particular form, only the binding place, arising place, and existence place of a living being who binds that particular binding place are mentioned. This is called **Ogh** form. In the **Aadesh** form, the binding place, arising place, and existence place are considered in the context of **Mithyadrishti** (false vision) etc. **Gunasthanas** (qualities) and **Gati** (motion) etc. **Marganas** (paths). The author has clearly indicated through the terms **Ogh** and **Aadesh** that both types of breaking of perceptions of binding place etc. will be explained here.
Now, let's first consider the breaking of perceptions through **Ogh**. Then, **Panchodaya** (five arising places) **Santa** (existence places) **Tevise** (twenty-three), **Pannavis** (twenty-two) **Chavose** (twenty-six), **Atth** (eight) **Chauratu** (four) **Bhatthavise** (twenty-eight) in the binding place of **Nav** (nine) **Satt** (seven) **Patis** (twenty-nine) **Sosamm** (thirty) in the natural binding place.

**Egegemegatise Ege Eguday Atu Santtammi. Ubaraybandhe Vas Vas Beygasanttammi Thanani. ||32||**

In the 31st natural bondage-place, there is one bondage-place, one arising-place, and eight being-places. In the absence of bondage, there are ten arising-places and ten being-places.

**Explanation:**

* **Egegemegatise:** 31st
* **Ege:** One
* **Eguday:** One arising-place
* **Atu Santtammi:** Eight being-places
* **Ubaraybandhe:** In the absence of bondage
* **Vas Vas:** Ten, ten
* **Beygasanttammi:** Arising-places and being-places
* **Thanani:** Places

**Further Explanation:**

* In the 25th and 26th natural bondage-places, there are nine arising-places and five being-places each.
* In the 28th natural bondage-place, there are eight arising-places and four being-places.
* In the 29th and 30th natural bondage-places, there are nine arising-places and nine being-places.
* In the 31st natural bondage-place, there is one arising-place and one being-place.
* In the first natural bondage-place, there is one arising-place and eight being-places.

**Translation:**

* **Nine arising-places and five being-places in the 25th and 26th. Eight and four in the 28th. Nine and nine in the 29th and 30th. One arising-place and eight being-places in the first. Ten arising-places and ten being-places in the absence of bondage.**

## Chapter 70

**Special Note:** In these two verses, it is explained how many **Udayasthanas** (stages of arising) and **Sattaasthanas** (stages of existence) are present in each **Bandhastan** (stage of bondage). However, it is not clear what the nature of these Udayasthanas and Sattaasthanas are, and which ones are present. Therefore, this will be clarified based on the commentary by Acharya Malayagiri.

In each of the 23, 25, and 26 **Prakrutik Bandhaasthanas** (stages of bondage based on nature), there are nine **Udayasthanas** and five **Sattaasthanas** - "**Nav Pancha Uday Satta**...". Their explanation is as follows:

In the 23 **Prakrutik Bandhastan**, bondage of **Apariapt** (insufficient) **Ekendriya** (one-sense) **Yogya** (capable) **Prakrutis** (natures) occurs, and this is bound by **Ekendriya**, **Dwiindriya**, **Triindriya**, **Chaturindriya**, **Tiryanch Panchendriya**, and **Manushya** (human). To save these 23 **Prakrutis**, the **Jivas** (souls) have nine **Udayasthanas** of 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31 **Prakrutis**, which are common to all. These **Udayasthanas** should be understood as follows:

The **Ekendriya**, **Dwiindriya**, **Triindriya**, **Chaturindriya**, **Tiryanch Panchendriya**, and **Manushya** who are binding the 23 **Prakrutis** have a **Udayasthan** of 21 **Prakrutis** in the **Bhavas** (cycles of birth and death). This is because in the arising of 21 **Prakrutis**, the bondage of 23 **Prakrutis** is possible, which are **Apariapt** and **Yogya** for **Ekendriya**.

The **Udayasthan** of 24 **Prakrutis** is for **Apariapt** and **Paryapt** (sufficient) **Ekendriya**. This **Udayasthan** is not found anywhere else except for **Ekendriya**.

The **Udayasthan** of 25 **Prakrutis** is for **Paryapt** **Ekendriya** and **Vaikriya** (transformed) **Sharira** (body) who have attained **Mithyadrishti** (false belief) **Tiryanch** (animal) and **Manushya**.

The **Udayasthan** of 26 **Prakrutis** is for **Paryapt** **Ekendriya** and **Paryapt** and **Apariapt** **Dwiindriya**, **Triindriya**, **Chaturindriya**, **Tiryanch Panchendriya**, and **Manushya**.

The **Udayasthan** of 27 **Prakrutis** is for **Paryapt** **Ekendriya** and those who have **Vaikriya** **Sharira** and have become **Paryapt** in **Sharira** (body) **Paryapti** (sufficiency), who are **Mithyadrishti** **Tiryanch** and **Manushya**.

The three **Udayasthanas** of 28, 29, and 30 **Prakrutis** are...

**Mithyadrishti** is present in **dvi-indriya**, **tri-indriya**, **chatur-indriya**, **panch-indriya** humans and **31** **prakriti** **udayasthan** in **vikala-indriya** and **tiryanch panch-indriya** beings. Except for these beings, the remaining beings do not bind **23** **prakriti**. Therefore, in the **23** **prakriti** **bandha-sthan**, there are **9** **udayasthan** of the aforementioned **21** **prakriti**.

Beings who bind **23** **prakriti** have **five** **satta-sthan**. The number of **prakriti** they acquire in each is as follows: **62**, **88**, **86**, **80**, and **78**. This is explained as follows: The aforementioned beings who have **21** **prakriti** **udayasthan** have all **satta-sthan**, except for humans who do not have **78** **prakriti** **satta-sthan**. This is because **78** **prakriti** **satta-sthan** is present when comparing **manushya-gati** and **manushya-nupurvi**. However, humans cannot **udbalana** these two **prakriti**.

Even during **24** **prakriti** **udayasthan**, all five **satta-sthan** are present. However, **vaikriya-sharira** **vayu-kayika** beings, despite having **24** **prakriti** **udayasthan**, do not have **80** and **78** **prakriti** **satta-sthan**. This is because their **vaikriya-shatk** and **manushya-dvik** are present by rule. These beings are directly experiencing the **vaikriya-sharira**. Therefore, they cannot **udbalana** their **vaikriya-dvik**, and without it, they cannot **udbalana** **deva-dvik** and **naraka-dvik**. This is because **vaikriya-shatk** **udbalana** happens simultaneously, which is a natural rule. And **manushya-dvik** **udbalana** only happens after **vaikriya-shatk** **udbalana**, not before. This is also mentioned in **Churni**:

> **Janakam ubalay paccchha manuyagam javalay**

This means that after **udbalana** of **vaikriya-shatk**, the being **udbalana** **manushya-dvik**. This proves that...

## Chapter on Saptaatika

**Regarding the 24 natural states of existence for air-bodied beings who do not possess a Vaikriya body, there are 62, 88, and 56 natural states of existence, which are Soma, Saatapaama, and Ho respectively. However, there are no states of existence with 80 and 78 natural qualities.**

**Even with 25 natural states of existence, the aforementioned five states of existence are present. However, among them, the 78 natural states of existence are only for air-bodied beings who do not possess a Vaikriya body and for fire-bodied beings, not for others. This is because, except for fire-bodied and air-bodied beings, all other beings bind themselves to the human path and the path preceding it according to the rules of the Jiva.**

**According to the opinion of the Churnikaar, except for fire-bodied and air-bodied beings, all other beings bind themselves to the human path according to the rules of the Jiva. This proves that the 78 natural states of existence are not attained by anyone except fire-bodied beings and air-bodied beings who do not possess a Vaikriya body.**

**Even with 26 natural states of existence, the aforementioned five states of existence are present. However, it is special that the natural states of existence are for air-bodied beings who do not possess a Vaikriya body and for fire-bodied beings. Also, for those two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, and five-sensed beings, both sufficient and insufficient, in whom the aforementioned fire-bodied and air-bodied beings are born, the 78 natural states of existence are present until they are bound to the human path and the path preceding it.**

**In the 27 natural states of existence, except for the 78 natural states of existence, the remaining four states of existence are present. Because the 25 natural states of existence are for sufficient Baadar Ekendriya and Vaikriya body-possessing Tithanch and humans, excluding fire-bodied and air-bodied beings.** 

Page #231:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karma-pranya 
163

It happens. But because of the existence of their two human states, 78 natural states of existence are not found. 

Here, the inquisitive person asks: What is the reason for the 27 natural states of arising not being found in the fire-bodied and air-bodied beings? The solution is that the 27 natural states of arising for the one-sensed beings occur when one of the natures of Attap and Udyot is combined, but the fire-bodied and air-bodied beings do not have the arising of Attap and Udyot. Therefore, the 27 natural states of arising do not occur.

The 28, 29, 30, and 35 natural states of arising have four states of existence remaining, excluding the 78 natural states of existence, according to the rule. Because the arising of the 28, 29, and 30 natures occurs for the sufficiently विकलेन्द्रिय, तिथंच पंचेन्द्रिय, and humans, and the 31 natural state of arising occurs for the sufficiently विकलेन्द्रिय and five-sensed तिर्यंच. But the existence of the human motion, human-like, in these beings is found according to the rule. Therefore, the 78 natural states of existence do not occur in those states of arising. In this way, there are forty states of existence in comparison to the nine states of arising appropriate for the beings who bind the 23 natures.

The states of arising and states of existence for the beings who bind the 25 and 26 natures should also be known in the same way. But there is this special feature: for the sufficiently one-sensed beings, the 25 and 26 natures, the 21, 25, 27, 28, 29, and 30 natural states of arising for the gods, only these two states of existence, 12 and 88 natural states of existence, are obtained. 

Insufficiently 1, or how come the 27 arising for the fire and air beings does not happen, by which that earning is done?

It is said: The 27 arising is obtained for the one-sensed beings when there is a projection of either Attap or Udyot, but the arising of Attap and Udyot is not possible for the fire and air beings, therefore, that exclusion.

## Chapter 71

**164**

The seven-sense, five-sense, and human beings are not bound by the 25 **Prakritis** suitable for them. Because, in the aforementioned insufficient beings, **Devas** are not born. Therefore, there are 40 **Satta-sthana** in each of these **Bandha-sthana**, 25 and 26 **Prakritis** from the general.

After explaining the **Bandha-sthana** of the 23rd, 25th, and 26th **Prakritis**, now we explain the **Udaya** and **Satta-sthana** of the 28th **Prakriti** as "**Attha Chauratthavise**", meaning eight **Udaya-sthana** and four **Satta-sthana**. The eight **Udaya-sthana** are as follows: 21st, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, and 31st **Prakritis**.

There are two types of **Bandha-sthana** for the 28th **Prakriti**: 1. **Devagati-prayogya** (suitable for **Deva** realm), 2. **Naraka-mati-prayogya** (suitable for **Naraka** realm).

In the case of **Bandha** of the 28th **Prakriti** suitable for **Deva** realm, there are eight **Udaya-sthana** as mentioned above, depending on the different beings. In the case of **Bandha** of the **Prakritis** suitable for **Naraka** realm, there are only two **Udaya-sthana**: 30th and 31st **Prakritis**.

Among them, the **Bandha** of the 28th **Prakriti** suitable for **Deva** realm occurs in the **Apanta-ral** (interval) of the existence of **Kshayik Samyag-drsti** or **Vedak Samyag-drsti**, five-sense, seven-sense, and humans, in the 21st **Prakriti** **Udaya-sthana**. The 25th **Prakriti** **Udaya-sthana** occurs in **Aharak** restrained, **Samyag-drsti** or **Mithya-drsti**, humans and **Tiryanch** who have **Vaikriya** body. The 26th **Prakriti** **Udaya-sthana** occurs in **Kshayik Samyag-drsti** or **Vedak Samyag-drsti**, five-sense, seven-sense, and humans who have **Sharir-sth** (body-based) senses. The 27th **Prakriti** **Udaya-sthana** occurs in **Aharak** restrained, **Samyag-drsti** or **Mithya-drsti**, **Tiryanch** and humans who have **Vaikriya** body. The 28th and 29th **Prakriti** **Udaya-sthana** occurs in **Kshayik Samyag-drsti** or **Vedak Samyag-drsti**, **Tiryanch** and humans who have attained **Sharir-paryapti** (body-sufficiency) and **Pranapan-paryapti** (breath-sufficiency), and in **Samyag-drsti** or **Mithya-drsti**, **Tiryanch** and humans who are **Aharak** restrained, **Vaikriya** restrained, and have **Dakriya** body. 

Page #233:
---------------------------
## The Last Karma Granth

This pertains to humans. There are 30 natural arising places (udayasthan) for **Samyagdrishti**, **Mithyadrishti**, or **Samyamihyadrishti**, for both humans and animals, as well as for **Aharak** and **Vaikriya** restrained beings. There are 31 natural arising places for **Samyagdrishti** or **Mithyadrishti** for five-sense animals.

For beings destined for hell, there are 28 natural binding places (bandhastan) with 30 natural arising places for **Mithyadrishti** for five-sense animals and humans, and 31 natural arising places for **Mithyadrishti** for five-sense animals.

Now, considering the existence places (sattastan) in the 28 natural binding places, there are four existence places for beings who bind 28 natural places, namely 62, 86, 88, and 86 natural places. However, for beings who have 21 natural arising places and bind 28 natural places destined for heaven, there are only two existence places, 12 and 8. This is because the **Tirthankara** nature does not exist here. If we consider the **Tirthankara** nature, then the 28 natural binding places destined for heaven would not be formed.

With 25 natural arising places, the binding of 28 natural places occurs for animals and humans who have **Aharak** and **Vaikriya** bodies. Therefore, there are only two existence places here, 62 and 85 natural places. Out of these, the **Aharak** fourfold (Aharakchatuṣka) exists by rule for **Aharak** restrained beings, resulting in only 62 natural places for them. For the remaining beings, the **Aharak** fourfold may or may not exist, leading to two existence places for them.

With 26, 27, 28, and 26 natural arising places, there are also two existence places, 62 and 86 natural places.

In the 30 natural arising places, for beings who bind 28 natural places destined for heaven or hell, there are four existence places, 62, 86, 88, and 86 natural places. Out of these, 12 and 88 natural places...

The consideration of the seven states of existence is as before. However, regarding the two states of existence, there is this special characteristic: When a being, after binding the karma of hell, becomes a Samyakdrishti (rightly-seeing) and binds the karma of a Tirthankara, and later, at the end of the human existence, becomes a Mithyadrishti (wrongly-seeing) due to the loss of Samyaktva (right faith), then in the final moment of his life, he does not bind the karma of a Tirthankara, but only the karma of 28 natures. He attains only 28 natures in his existence. Here, the existence of the natures is explained. 

Out of the 30 natures, excluding the Tirthankara, the four Aharakchatushk, the Devagati, Devanupurvi, Narakagati, Narakanupurvi, and the four Vaikriya, there are 80 natures in the state of existence. 

Thus, a being with 80 natures, whether a five-sensed animal, a human, or a Tiryanch (non-human), attains the fullness of all perfections. If, later, he becomes a pure-resultant being, he binds the karma of 28 natures, which are suitable for the Devagati (heavenly realm), and thus attains the existence of the two Devadvik and the four Vaikriya. Therefore, at the time of binding the karma of 28 natures, he has 86 natures in his existence. 

If the being becomes a karmic-resultant being, he binds the karma of 28 natures, which are suitable for the Narakagati (hell realm), and thus attains the existence of the two Narakadvik and the four Vaikriya. This also results in 86 natures in his state of existence. 

Therefore, in the 30-natured state of arising, when the karma of 28 natures is bound, there are 62 natures, and in the 6-natured state, there are four states of existence.

In the 31-natured state of arising, there are three states of existence: 12, 88, and 86 natures. Here, there is no state of existence of 31 natures. Because the being who binds the karma of 28 natures and arises with 31 natures will be a five-sensed animal. And the five-sensed animals do not have the existence of the Tirthankara nature. Because the being with the existence of the Tirthankara nature, who is a human, does not exist among the five-sensed animals.

It is not born. Therefore, the six natural states of existence are prohibited here.
29 and 30 natural bondage states each have 6 arising states and 7 states of existence - "Navasanttugatisa Tisasmi". These are discussed below.

In the 26 natural bondage, 2124 25 26 27 2 26 30 and 31 natural, these are the arising states and 392680 and 78 natural, these are the 7 states of existence. Of these, the first arising states are explained as follows: the arising of 21 natures is for the worthy of the Tiryanch and humans, the bondage of 26 natures is for the sufficient and insufficient one-sensory, disabled-sensory Tiryanch and humans, and for the gods and hell beings. The arising of 24 natures is for the sufficient one-sensory gods and hell beings, and for the false-sighted Tiryanch and humans who make the Vaikriya body. The arising of 26 natures is for the sufficient one-sensory, and for the sufficient and insufficient disabled-sensory Tiryanch five-sensory and humans. The arising of 27 natures is for the sufficient one-sensory gods and hell beings, and for the false-sighted Tiryanch and humans who make the Vaikriya body. The arising of 28 and 26 natures is for the disabled-sensory, Tiryanch five-sensory and humans, and for the Tiryanch and humans who make the Vaikriya body, and for the gods and hell beings. The arising of 30 natures is for the disabled-sensory, Tiryanch five-sensory and humans, and for the gods who experience the Udyot. The arising of 31 natures is for the sufficient disabled-sensory and Tiryanch five-sensory who experience the Udyot, and for the unwavering right-sighted humans who are worthy of the god-state and who bind the 26 natures. 21, 26, 28, 29 and 30 natural, these are the five arising states. 25, 27, 28, 26 and 30 for the food-restrained and Vaikriya-restrained,

## Chapter 73

There are five **udayasthanas** (stages of arising) in **prakriti** (nature). These are the **udayasthanas** of the **asanyata** (unrestrained) and **tasangan** (those who have not attained liberation) humans who perform **vaikriya sharira** (transformation of the body). Except for the **sanyata** (restrained) humans, if other humans perform **vaikriya sharira**, their **udyota** (effort) does not arise. Therefore, there are not 30 **prakriti udayasthanas** here. Thus, in the 26 **prakriti bandhastanas** (stages of bondage), the **udayasthanas** are considered as follows: 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31 **prakriti** are the nine **udayasthanas**.

Now, let's consider the **sattastanas** (stages of existence). It was previously mentioned that there are seven **sattastanas** in the 26 **prakriti bandhastanas**, with 63, 92, 86, 88, 86, 80, and 78 **prakriti**. Their explanation is as follows:

If there are 21 **prakriti udayasthanas** for **ekendriya** (one-sensed), **vikaleendriya** (imperfect-sensed), and **tiryanch panchendriya** (animal with five senses) beings who bind 26 **prakriti** due to their **paryaapt** (sufficient) and **aparyaapt** (insufficient) **karma** (actions), then there are five **sattastanas**: 62, 88, 86, 80, and 78. Similarly, in the 24, 25, and 26 **prakriti udayasthanas**, one should know these five **sattastanas**. And in the five **udayasthanas** of 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31 **prakriti**, there are four **sattastanas** except for the 78 **prakriti sattastanas**. This should be understood in the same way as it was explained for beings who bind 23 **prakriti**.

For **ekendriya**, **vikaleendriya**, and **tiryanch panchendriya** beings who bind 26 **prakriti** suitable for **manushya gati** (human existence), and for humans who bind 26 **prakriti** suitable for both **manushya gati** and **tiryanch gati** (animal existence), there are four **sattastanas** except for the 78 **prakriti sattastanas**, while remaining in their respective **udayasthanas**. For **dev** (gods) and **narak** (hell beings) who bind 29 **prakriti** suitable for **tiryanch panchendriya** and **manushya gati**, there are two **sattastanas** in their respective **udayasthanas**: 62 and 88 **prakriti**.

**16E**

It is said that while a being bound by 26 **Prakritis** suitable for the human path, who is a **Mithyaishti** and a **Naraka**, is tormented by the **Tirthankara** **Prakriti**, it has only one **Satta Sthan** of 86 **Prakritis** in its five **Uday Sthanas**. This is because if a being is associated with the **Tirthankara** **Prakriti**, it can only be considered **Mithya** if it is devoid of the **Aharaka Chatushk**. This is because the rule is that the **Tirthankara** and the **Aharaka Chatushk** cannot coexist in the **Mithyaishti** **Gunasthan**. Therefore, when the **Aharaka Chatushk** is removed from the 63 **Prakritis**, the being is found to have only 86 **Prakritis**.

A being bound by 26 **Prakritis** suitable for the **Devagati**, who is an **Avirat Samyagdristi** and a human, has 21 **Prakritis** in its **Uday**, resulting in two **Satta Sthanas** of 63 and 86 **Prakritis**. Similarly, in the six **Uday Sthanas** of 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30 **Prakritis**, these two **Satta Sthanas** should be understood. However, in the case of **Aharaka** **Samyatas**, it should be understood that they have only one **Satta Sthan** of 63 **Prakritis** in their respective **Uday Sthanas**.

Thus, in the general **Bandha Sthan** of 26 **Prakritis**, there are 7 **Prakritis** in the **Uday** of 21 **Prakritis**, 5 **Prakritis** in the **Uday** of 24 **Prakritis**, 7 **Prakritis** in the **Uday** of 25 **Prakritis**, 7 **Prakritis** in the **Uday** of 26 **Prakritis**, and 7 **Prakritis** in the **Uday** of 27 **Prakritis**.

**Tithahara Jugavan Satvam Tityam Na Micchhagadittie. Tassatkammiyanam Taggunthanam Na Samvadi.**

– **Gokarmakand** **Ga. 333**

The above quote states that the **Tirthankara** and the **Aharaka Chatushk** cannot coexist in a **Mithyaishti** being. However, **Ga. 365, 366** of the **Gokarmakand** on **Satta Adhikar** suggests that there has been an opinion that the **Tirthankara** and the **Aharaka Chatushk** can coexist in a **Mithyadristi**. 

Page #238:
---------------------------
## The Chapter of Seven Tika

There are 6 Sattastana in the case of 6 Udya, 6 Sattastana in the case of 28 Udya, 6 Sattastana in the case of 29 Udya, 6 Sattastana in the case of 30 Udya, and 4 Sattastana in the case of 31 Udya. The total of all these is 7+5+7+7+6+9+6+454 = 200.

Now, let's consider the 30 Prakruti Bandha Sthana. Just as we considered the Udya Sthana of Ekendriya, Vikalendriya, Tiyantra Panchendriya, Manushya, Deva, and Naraka, who bind 26 Prakruti suitable for Tiryanch Gati, in the same way, we should contemplate the Udya Sthana and Sattastana of Ekendriya, etc., who bind 30 Prakruti suitable for Tiryanch Gati, including Udyot. In this, there are two Sattastana, 63 and 66 Prakruti, in the 21 Prakruti Udya Sthana of Devas who bind 30 Prakruti. And there is only one Sattastana, 63 Prakruti, in the case of Narakas who have 21 Prakruti Udya. There is no 63 Prakruti Sattastana. Because a being who has the presence of Tirthankara and Aharaka Chatushk is not born in Naraka.

"Jass Lig Ra-Aharagani Jugavam Santi So Neraiyesun Uvavakjai." The one who has the simultaneous presence of Tirthankara and Aharaka Chatushk, does not get born in Naraka. This view of Churnikar also supports this opinion.

Similarly, we should understand this in the case of 25, 27, 28, 29, and 30 Prakruti Udya Sthana. But there is a special feature that there is no 30 Prakruti Udya Sthana for Narakas. Because 30 Prakruti Udya Sthana is found in the presence of Udyot Prakruti, but Udyot does not arise in Narakas.

In this way, in general, the beings who bind 30 Prakruti...

## Sixth Karma Granth
### 2.1

There are 7 **satta-sthana** (states of existence) in the emergence of 21 **prakritis** (principles), 5 in the emergence of 24 **prakritis**, 7 in the emergence of 25 **prakritis**, 5 in the emergence of 26 **prakritis**, 6 in the emergence of 27 **prakritis**, 6 in the emergence of 28 **prakritis**, 6 in the emergence of 29 **prakritis**, 6 in the emergence of 30 **prakritis**, and 4 in the emergence of 37 **prakritis**. The total number of **satta-sthana** is 7+5+7+5+6+6+6+6+4 = 52.

Now, let's consider the **udaya-sthana** (state of emergence) and **satta-sthana** in the 31 **prakriti** **bandha-sthana** (state of bondage). In the 31 **prakriti** **bandha-sthana**, there is one **udaya-sthana** and one **satta-sthana** - '**ege-gme-gati-se**'. The **udaya-sthana** is 30 **prakritis** and the **satta-sthana** is 63 **prakritis**. It should be understood that the bondage of 31 **prakritis**, including **tirthankara** and **aahara** (those who are eligible for **devagati** - the path of gods), occurs in two **guna-sthana** (states of qualities) - **aprammatta-samyata** (unwavering restraint) and **apuurva-karan** (unprecedented cause). However, neither **vikriya** (transformation) nor **aahara** **samudghata** (destruction of the **aahara** principle) occurs in these. Therefore, instead of 25 **prakritis** etc. being the **udaya-sthana**, there is only one **udaya-sthana** of 30 **prakritis**. Since the bondage of **aahara** and **tirthankara** **prakritis** occurs here, there is only one **satta-sthana** of 63 **prakritis**. Thus, in the 31 **prakriti** **bandha-sthana**, 30 **prakritis** are considered as **udaya-sthana** and 63 **prakritis** as **satta-sthana**.

Now, let's consider the **udaya-sthana** and **satta-sthana** in the one **prakriti** **bandha-sthana**. The **gatha** (verse) provides a clue to the number of **udaya-sthana** and **satta-sthana** in the one **prakriti** **bandha-sthana**: "**Ege Agu-daya Attha-santammi**" - meaning, there is one **udaya-sthana** and eight **satta-sthana**. The **udaya-sthana** is 30 **prakritis**, and the eight **satta-sthana** are 63, 62, 86, 88, 80, 76, 76, and 75 **prakritis**. Their explanation is as follows: In the one **prakriti** **bandha-sthana**, there is a bondage of one **yasha-kirti** **prakriti** (principle of fame and glory). 

Page #240:
---------------------------
## Chapter 202: Sapttatika

This chapter deals with the seventh to tenth **guna-sthana** (stages of spiritual progress) of **apuurvakarana** (the process of purification). Due to the extreme purity of the soul at this stage, it does not experience **vaikriya** (physical transformations) or **aaharaka** (nutritive) **samudghata** (agitation), resulting in only one **30-prakritik** (30-natured) **udayasthan** (state of arising) instead of the usual 25 **prakritik** **udayasthan**.

Within the **one-prakritik** **bandha-sthan** (state of bondage), there are eight **satta-sthan** (states of existence). The first four, **63**, **92**, and the **prakritikasthana** (natural state), are considered **upshama-shreni** (ascending series) while the last four, **80**, **76**, **76**, and **75**, are considered **kshapka-shreni** (descending series). However, until the first stage of **anivrittikarana** (cessation of karmic bondage) is complete, the **13 prakritis** (natures) of **sthavar** (stationary), **sukshma** (subtle), **tiryach-dwik** (two-way moving), **naraka-dwik** (two-way moving in hell), **jati-chatuksh** (four-fold birth), **sadharan** (ordinary), **athap** (heat), and **udyol** (effort) are not destroyed, and the first four **satta-sthan** of **63** etc. are still found in the **kshapka-shreni**.

Therefore, in the **one-prakritik** **bandha-sthan**, there is one **30-prakritik** **udayasthan** and eight **satta-sthan** of **63**, **62**, **86**, **88**, **80**, **76**, **76**, and **75**.

Now, let's consider the **udayasthan** and **satta-sthan** of the **uparat-bandha** (state of cessation of bondage). Even though there is no bondage, we still consider **udayasthan** and **satta-sthan** because **namakarma** (karma related to name and form) binds until the tenth **guna-sthan**, not beyond. However, **uday** (arising) and **satta** (existence) continue until the fourteenth **guna-sthan**. Despite this, there are various **udayasthan** and **satta-sthan** depending on the different conditions and types of souls. The verse states:

**Varche bas bas beyerasanttammi thanani.**

Meaning: Even in the absence of bondage, there are ten **udayasthan** and ten **satta-sthan**. 

Page #241:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karma Granth, Chapter 203

There are ten **Udayasthanas** with **Prakriti** numbers 20, 21, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 6, and 8. And there are two **Sattaasthanas** with **Prakriti** numbers 93, 62, 86, 88, 80, 76, 76, 75, 6, and 6. Here is their explanation:

A **Kevali** takes eight **Samayas** to reach **Kevali Samudghat**. During the third, fourth, and fifth **Samayas**, **Karman Kayayog** occurs. This includes twelve **Prakritis**: **Panchendriya Jati**, **Asatrik**, **Subhag**, **Aadey**, **Yash Kirti**, **Manushya Gati**, and **Dhruvodaya**. In total, this results in 20 **Prakriti** **Udayasthanas**. Without a **Tirthankara**, there are 76 **Prakriti** **Sattaasthanas**. And without a **Tirthankara** and the **Aharak Chatushk** (four types of food), there are 75 **Prakriti** **Sattaasthanas**. If a **Tirthankara** is present in this state, their **Tirthankara Prakriti** will add one **Prakriti** to the **Udayasthanas**, resulting in 21 **Prakriti** **Udayasthanas** and 80 and 76 **Prakriti** **Sattaasthanas**.

When a **Kevali** is in **Audarik Mishr Kayayog** during **Kevali Samudghat**, they have six **Prakritis**: **Audarikatik**, **Vachrishbhanaraach Sanhanan**, one of the six **Sansthanas**, **Upghat**, and **Pratyek**. Adding these six **Prakritis** to the previous 20 **Prakritis** results in 26 **Prakriti** **Udayasthanas** and two **Sattaasthanas** with 76 and 75 **Prakritis**.

If a **Tirthankara** is in **Audarik Mishr Kayayog**, their **Tirthankara Prakriti** will add one **Prakriti** to the **Udayasthanas**, resulting in 27 **Prakriti** **Udayasthanas** and two **Sattaasthanas** with 80 and 76 **Prakritis**.

Adding four **Prakritis** to the 26 **Prakritis**: **Paraghat**, **Uchch Vash**, one of **Shubh** and **Ashubh Vihayogati**, and one of **Suswar** and **Dushwar**, results in 30 **Prakriti** **Udayasthanas**. This occurs for a general **Kevali** in **Audarik Kayayog** and for those who have attained the eleventh and twelfth **Gunasthanas**. Therefore, 30 **Prakriti** **Udayasthanas...**

## Chapter 73

**I**

There are six states of being: 63, 62, 86, 86, 76, and 75 *prakritis*. The first four states of being are in relation to the *upashantamoha* *gunasthan*, and the last two states of being are in relation to the *kshinamoha* and *sayogikevali*. If we remove the *svara* *prakriti* from the 30 *prakritis* of the *udayasthan* and add the *tirthankara* *prakriti*, we still get the same *udayasthan*, which occurs when the *tirthankara* *kevali* stops the *vakyayoga*. However, in this case, there are two states of being: 80 and 76 *prakritis*. This is because when the *tirthankara* *prakriti* is added to the 76 and 75 *prakritis* of the *samanakevali*, we get the states of being of 80 and 76 *prakritis*.

When the *tirthankara* *prakriti* is added to the 30 *prakritis* of the *udayasthan* of the *samanakevali*, we get the 31 *prakritis* of the *udayasthan* of the *tirthankara* *kevali*. Similarly, there are two states of being: 80 and 76 *prakritis*. This is because when the *tirthankara* *prakriti* is added to the 75 and 79 *prakritis* of the *samanakevali*, we get the numbers 76 and 80.

When the *vakyayoga* is stopped in the 30 *prakritis* of the *udayasthan* of the *samanakevali*, the *svara* *prakriti* is removed, resulting in 26 *prakritis* of the *udayasthan*. Alternatively, when the *shvasochchhvas* is stopped in the 30 *prakritis* of the *udayasthan* of the *tirthankara* *kevali*, the *uchchhvas* *prakriti* is removed, resulting in 26 *prakritis* of the *udayasthan*. The first *udayasthan* is of the *samanakevali*, and the second *udayasthan* is of the *tirthankara* *kevali*. Therefore, in the first 26 *prakritis* of the *udayasthan*, there are two states of being: 76 and 75 *prakritis*. In the second 26 *prakritis* of the *udayasthan*, there are two states of being: 80 and 76 *prakritis*.

For a common Kevali, 26 natural उदयस्थान are mentioned for the cessation of Vachan Yoga. Out of these, 28 natural उदयस्थान occur due to the decrease in Ucchvasa Prakriti when Vassochchvasa is ceased. This happens for a common Kevali, therefore here there are two Satta Sthan: 76 and 75 natural.

For an Aayogik Kevali in the Gujस्थान, natural उदयस्थान occurs and there are three Satta Sthan: 80 and 76 until the penultimate time, and natural in the final time. However, compared to a common Kevali, natural उदयस्थान occurs in the Aayogik Gunस्थान, and there are three Satta Sthan: 76 and 75 until the penultimate time, and natural in the final time.

In this way, one should understand the statement of ten उदयस्थान and ten Satta Sthan in the absence of bondage.

The description of the relationship between the bondage, उदय, and Satta Sthan of Name Karma is as follows:

| Gun Sthan | Bandha Sthan | Mang | उदयस्थान | उदय Mang | Satta Sthan |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 5 | 23 | 12, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27 | 5 | 12, 86, 86, 80, 78 |

Thus, the statement of the bond location, udayasthan, and sattaasthan of the eight karmas and their mutual samvegbhangs is complete. Now, in the same order, we will state the bhang in relation to their jeevasthan and gunasthan.

**"Tivigapppapagavaanehi jeevagunasannieesu thaanesu. Bhangaa pajijavyaa jaththa jahaa sambhavo bhava." ||33||**

**Translation:**

By the three alternative prakriti sthans (bond, uday, and satta), in the jeevagunasannieesu (places with jeeva and guna), thaanesu (locations), bhangaa (bhang) should be performed, jaththa (where), jahaa sambhavo (as much as possible), bhava (happens).

**Gavaarth:**

By the three alternative prakriti sthans (bond, uday, and satta), in the locations with jeeva and guna (jeevasthan, gunasthan), as many bhangs as possible should be performed.

**Vishesharth:**

Until now, the granth has explained the bond location, udayasthan, and sattaasthan of the mula and uttar prakritis and their samvegbhangs. Along with this, it has also explained these locations of the mula prakritis and their samvegbhangs.

## The Chapter of the Seven Tika

The Lord has instructed regarding the Jiva-sthana (states of the soul) and Guna-sthana (states of qualities). However, He has not instructed regarding the Bandha-sthana (states of bondage), Udaya-sthana (states of arising), and their related Bhangas (destructions) in relation to the Uttar-Prakriti (later nature). This promise to instruct about them is made in this gatha, stating that all the Bhangas of the three types of Prakriti-sthana (states of nature) will be explained by relating them to the Jiva-sthana and Guna-sthana.

First, we will explain the Bhangas of the three types of Prakriti-sthana in the Jiva-sthana. Among the Jiva-sthana, we will first explain the Bhangas of the Sanvesha (accumulation) of the Avasthana (states).

**Gatha 34:**

**Terasamu jivasankhevaesu naanansaray tivigappo | Ekkammi tivigappo karanam pai etya avigappo ||**

**Word Meaning:**

* Terasamu - thirteen
* Jivasankhevae - regarding the summary (states) of the soul
* Naanansaray - of the Jnanavarana (veil of knowledge) and Antaraya Karma (hindering karma)
* Tivigappo - three alternatives
* Ekkammi - in one Jiva-sthana
* Sivinappo - three or two alternatives
* Karanam pai - in relation to the Karan (substance)
* Etya - here
* Avigappo - absence of alternatives

**Gatha Meaning:**

In the first thirteen Jiva-sthana, there are three alternatives for the Jnanavarana and Antaraya Karma. In one Jiva-sthana (Paryapta Sanjee Panchaendriya), there are three and two alternatives. In relation to the Karan (substance), there are no alternatives.

**Special Meaning:**

This gatha begins the explanation of the related Bhangas in the Jiva-sthana. First, we will explain the Bhangas of the Jnanavarana and Antaraya Karma.

## Sixth Karma Granth
211

The author has used the term "Jivasankhevaesu" in the verse to explain the meaning of the term "Jivasthan". This means that the Jivas are collected or gathered by the insufficient one-sense faculty and other Dharmas. This collection of Jivas is called "Jivasankhepa" and is referred to as "Jivasthan". Thus, the term "Jivasankhepa" is accepted as synonymous with "Jivasthan". The fourteen types of Jivasthan, including the one-sense faculty, subtle, insufficient, etc., have been explained in the Fourth Karma Granth.

Out of these fourteen Jivasthan, the first thirteen have three options for the Gnanavaran and Antaraya Karma: "Natara Mini!". This will be explained below.

Gnanavaran and Antaraya Karma have five Uttar-Prakritis each, and all these Prakritis are Dhruvbandhini, Dhruvodaya, and Dhruvsattaka. This is because the Uttar-Prakritis of these two Karmas remain bound, arising, and existing continuously until their final detachment. Therefore, in the first thirteen Jivasthan, the Uttar-Prakritis of Gnanavaran and Antaraya Karma have five-Prakriti binding, five-Prakriti arising, and five-Prakriti existence, which are found in three alternative forms. This is because in none of these Jivasthan is there any detachment of their binding, arising, and existence.

In the final fourteenth Jivasthan, the sufficient five-sense faculty, the detachment of Gnanavaran and Antaraya Karma happens first, followed by the detachment of arising and existence. Therefore, here, five-Prakriti binding, 
1. Sanksipyante - Sangrihyante Jivaa Ebhiriti Sanksepa: -  Insufficient one-sense faculty and other inter-species differences, the collection of Jivas is Jivasankhepa, meaning Jivasthan.
- Saptaatika Prakaran, page 165

---------------------------
The chapter on the seven categories (Sapttatika) discusses the five natural states of arising (udaya) and the five natural states of existence (satta). This results in three alternative forms (vikalapa) of a single entity (bhang). After the cessation of bondage (bandha), the five natural states of arising and the five natural states of existence result in two alternative forms of a single entity - 'Ekkammi Tiduvigappho'. The five natural states of bondage, arising, and existence are found in the subtle (sukshma) sampraya gunasthanas. After the cessation of bondage, the states of subdued delusion (upshanta moha) and diminished delusion (kshinamoha) in the gunasthanas have only two alternative forms (vikalapa) - 'Shik: Ta. Gahelo'. This is because the simultaneous cessation of arising and existence makes other forms of bhang impossible.

The पर्याप्त संज्ञी पंचेन्द्रिय जीवस्थान (Paryapta Sanjni Panchendriya Jeevasthan) has another characteristic: 'Karanam Pai Eththa Avigappho'. This means that after attaining omniscience (kevalgyan), the being does not have a mental body (bhavamana) but only a physical body (dravya mana). This is why they are still called पर्याप्त संज्ञी पंचेन्द्रिय. The Churni also states:

"Manakaranam Kevalino Vi Asthi Sen Sanino Vuchchati. Manovinaanm Pay Hai Samino Na Hathi."

This means that even the omniscient being has a mental organ (manakaran), which is why they are called संजी (Sanji). However, they are not संझी (Sanjhi) in terms of mental knowledge (manovinaan).

Such संयोगि (Sayogi) and अयोगि (Ayogi) मेयली (Meyali) beings, who are पर्याप्त संज्ञी पंचेन्द्रिय due to their association with the dravyagana, do not experience the three alternative forms or the two alternative forms of bhang. This means that the beings who are called पर्याप्त संज्ञी पंचेन्द्रिय due to their physical body (dravya mana) do not experience any bhang in terms of the bondage, arising, and existence of the knowledge-obscuring (gyanavaran) and obstructing (antaraya) karmas. This is because the cessation of bondage, arising, and existence of these karmas occurs before they become omniscient (kevali).

Thus, in the जीवस्थान (Jeevasthan), the knowledge-obscuring (gyanavaran) and obstructing (antaraya) karmas...

## Chapter 21

After explaining the six types of karma-grantha bhangas, we now discuss the components of the binding and other locations of Darshanavaran, Vedaniya, Ayu and Gotra karmas.

**Verse 35:**

**General Meaning:** In the thirteen locations of the soul, there are nine types of natural binding, four or five types of natural arising, and nine types of natural existence. In one location of the soul, there are eleven types of bhangas. In Vedaniya, Ayu and Gotra karmas, we will discuss the different types of Mohaniya karma.

**Specific Meaning:** The verse indicates that we will first discuss the binding and other locations of Darshanavaran, Vedaniya, Ayu and Gotra karmas, and then later discuss the different types of Mohaniya karma.

The binding and other locations of Darshanavaran karma are as follows: In the initial thirteen locations of the soul, there are nine types of natural binding, four or five types of natural arising, and nine types of natural existence. These constitute two types of bhangas. That is, nine types of natural binding, four types of natural arising, and nine types of natural existence constitute one type of bhangas, and nine types of natural binding, five types of natural arising, and nine types of natural existence constitute the second type of bhangas. Thus, there are two types of bhangas in the initial thirteen locations of the soul. The reason for this is that in the initial thirteen locations of the soul, there is neither a breaking of the binding nor a breaking of the arising of any of the subsequent natures of Darshanavaran karma.

Chapter on the Seven Tika
Neither is there a state of being nor a state of non-being. Among the five states of sleep, namely sleep, dreamless sleep, etc., one may or may not arise at a particular time. Therefore, two types of bhang are mentioned for the thirteen states of being of a jiva, depending on whether one of these five states of sleep arises or not.
However, in the state of a fully conscious five-sense jiva, there are eleven bhangs, "Egambhi Bhangmekara". Because in the state of a fully conscious five-sense jiva, all nine types of Darshanavaran karma, from the lowest to the highest, can be bound, arise, exist, and be destroyed. Therefore, in this state of being, twenty-one angas are indicated in relation to the binding, arising, and existence of the higher types of Darshanavaran karma. The consideration of these eleven bhangs has been done earlier in the context of the general bhangs of Darshanavaran. Therefore, they are not explained again here. Those who are curious should learn about them from there.
P
After mentioning the bhangs of Darshanavaran karma, they mention the bhangs of Vedaniya, Ayu, and Gotra karma. But the author himself has not mentioned the bhangs of these three karmas, nor has he mentioned how many bhangs are there in which state of being. But since their discussion is necessary, they are explained from other sources.
There is a verse in the Bhagya, which discusses the bhangs of Vedaniya and Gotra karma in relation to the fourteen states of being. The verse is as follows:
"Pajatasaniare Attha Chakkam Cha Vaiyanibhanga. Sakshama Lingam Cha Goe Palayam Jivatha."

## Sixth Karma Text

**215.** _That is, in the five-sense beings with sufficient knowledge, there are eight divisions of Vedaniya karma, and in the remaining thirteen types of beings, there are four divisions. Similarly, in the five-sense beings with sufficient knowledge, there are seven divisions of Gotra karma, and in each of the remaining thirteen types of beings, there are three divisions._

The detailed explanation of the above statement is as follows:

In the five-sense beings with sufficient knowledge, there are twelve possible combinations of qualities for Vedaniya karma. Therefore, there are eight divisions:

1. Binding of Asata, arising of Asata, and existence of both Asata and Sata.
2. Binding of Asata, arising of Sata, and existence of both Asata and Sata.
3. Binding of Sata, arising of Asata, and existence of both Asata and Sata.
4. Binding of Sata, arising of Sata, and existence of both Asata and Sata.
5. Arising of Asata and existence of both Asata and Sata.
6. Arising of Sata and existence of both Asata and Sata.
7. Arising of Asata and existence of Asata.
8. Arising of Sata and existence of Sata.

However, in each of the first thirteen types of beings, only the first four of these eight divisions are found. This is because in these beings, the binding, arising, and existence of both Sata and Asata Vedaniya are possible in all cases. In the Imoleena Bhashya Gatha, it is said: "In the beings with sufficient knowledge, there are four divisions of Vedaniya karma."

These eight divisions of Vedaniya karma should be categorized in relation to the Gunasthanas in the five-sense beings with sufficient knowledge as follows:

The first division, binding of Asata, arising of Asata, and existence of both Asata and Sata, and the second division, binding of Asata, arising of Sata, and existence of both Asata and Sata, are found from the first Mithyadristi Gunasthana to the sixth Pramatta-Samyata Gunasthana. This is because in the subsequent Gunasthanas, there is no binding of Asata Vedaniya. The third division...

## The Chapter of the Sevenfold

The sevenfold bondage, the sevenfold arising, and the existence of both the sevenfold and the non-sevenfold - these four divisions are found from the first Mithya Drishti Gunasthan to the thirteenth Sayogikevali Gunasthan. After that, due to the absence of bondage, the fifth division - the arising of the non-sevenfold and the existence of both the sevenfold and the non-sevenfold, and the sixth division - the arising of the sevenfold and the existence of both the sevenfold and the non-sevenfold, these two divisions are attained in the Ayogikevali Gunasthan until the penultimate time. And at the ultimate time, the seventh division - the arising of the non-sevenfold and the existence of the non-sevenfold, and the eighth division - the arising of the sevenfold and the existence of the sevenfold, these two divisions are found.

Sayogikevali and Ayogikevali are called Sanji in relation to the Dravyaman, therefore, there is no contradiction in accepting the eight divisions of Vedaniya Karma in the Sanji Panchendriya Paryapt Jeevasthan.

Thus, having explained the divisions of Vedaniya Karma, we now explain the aspects of Motr Karma: "Sattga Tigam Cha Goe" - they are as follows: In the Sanji Panchendriya Paryapt Jeevasthan of Gotr Karma, seven divisions are attained. These seven divisions are as follows: 1. The bondage of the low, the arising of the low, and the existence of the low, 2. The bondage of the low, the arising of the low, and the existence of both the low and the high, 3. The bondage of the low, the arising of the high, and the existence of both the low and the high, 4. The bondage of the high, the arising of the low, and the existence of both the low and the high, 5. The bondage of the high, the arising of the high, and the existence of both the low and the high, 6. The arising of the high and the existence of both the low and the high, and 7. The arising of the high and the existence of the high.

Of these seven divisions, the first division occurs to those Sanjis who... 

Page #255:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karma Granth 217

The first, second, and fourth of the seven bhangas are found in the remaining thirteen jiva sthans. The first bhang, which is the binding of the lower gotra, the arising of the lower gotra, and the existence of the lower gotra, occurs always in the agnikayik and vayukayik jivas after the uvalna of the higher gotra, but in the rest, it occurs for some time. The second bhang, which is the binding of the lower gotra, the arising of the lower gotra, and the existence of the higher and lower gotra, and the fourth bhang, which is the binding of the higher gotra, the arising of the lower gotra, and the existence of the higher and lower gotra, both these bhangas are also found in the thirteen jiva sthans due to the arising of the lower gotra. Other alternatives are not possible, because in the lower gotras, the arising of the higher gotra does not occur.

Thus, according to the Bhashya's verse, after explaining the bhangas of vedaniya and gotra karmas in the jiva sthans, now to explain the bhangas of ayu karma in the jiva sthans, the Bhashya's verse is quoted.

**Sixth Karma Granth**

_In the same way, one should understand the five alternatives of Ayukarma in Devas. However, the only difference is that instead of Narakayu, one should say Devayu. For example, the rise of Devayu and the existence of Devayu, etc._

_The nine alternatives for Tiryanchas are as follows:_

1. _The rise of Tiryanchayu, the existence of Tiryanchayu, this alternative is the age of Parbhavu before the time of bondage._
2. _The bondage of Narakayu in the time of bondage of Parbhavu, the rise of Tiryanchayu, the existence of Narak-Tiryanchayu, or_
3. _The bondage of Tiryanchayu, the rise of Tiryanchayu, and the existence of Tiryancha-Tiryanchayu, or_
4. _The bondage of Manushayau, the rise of Tiryanchayu, and the existence of Manusya-Tiryanchayu, or_
5. _The bondage of Devayu, the rise of Tiryanchayu, and the existence of Deva-Tiryanchayu._
6. _After the bondage of Parbhavu, the rise of Tiryanchayu, the existence of Narak-Tiryanchayu, or_
7. _The rise of Tiryanchayu, the existence of Tiryancha-Tiryanchayu, or_
8. _The rise of Tiryanchayu, the existence of Manusya-Tiryanchayu, or_
9. _The rise of Tiryanchayu, the existence of Deva-Tiryanchayu._

_In this way, there are nine alternatives of Ayukarma for the Sanjeevi Panchendriya Tiryanchas._

_Similarly, one should understand the nine alternatives for Manusyas, but with the difference that instead of Tiryanchayu, one should consider Manushayau. For example, the rise of Manushayau and the existence of Manushayau, etc._

_In this way, the total number of alternatives for Narakas (5), Devas (5), Tiryanchas (9), and Manusyas (9) is 5 + 5 + 9 + 9 = 28._

_Therefore, there are 28 alternatives of Ayukarma for the Sanjeevi Panchendriya Jeevas._

_There are ten alternatives for the Sanjeevi Panchendriya Aparayapt Jeevas. The Sanjeevi Panchendriya Aparayapt Jeevas are only Manusyas and Tiryanchas, because Devas and Narakas..._

## Chapter on the Seven Tika
## 220

The karma of insufficient name does not arise, and only the bondage of human and animal life occurs in relation to their past lives. Therefore, there are five destructions in relation to human life and five in relation to animal life, making a total of ten destructions. For example, in relation to animal life:

1. The arising of animal life before the bondage of life.
2. The bondage of animal life during the bondage of life.
3. The bondage of animal life and human life during the bondage of life.
4. The arising of animal life after the cessation of bondage.
5. The arising of animal life and the existence of human-animal life.

These are a total of five destructions.

Similarly, one should understand five destructions in relation to human life, but replace animal life with human life. For example, the arising of human life before the bondage of life and the existence of human life, etc.

The sufficient, non-conscious, five-sensed being is only an animal, and the bondage of its four abhus is possible. Therefore, there are the same nine destructions of life here as those explained for ordinary animals.

After explaining the destructions of the life karma in the three states of being, it is said that there are five destructions in each of the remaining eleven states of being. Because the beings in the remaining eleven states of being are only animals, and they do not have the bondage of divine life or hell life, therefore, one should know that there are five destructions for the conscious, five-sensed, insufficient animals: one destruction before the time of bondage, two destructions during the time of bondage, and two destructions after the cessation of bondage. Thus, there are five destructions in the remaining eleven states of being.

## Chapter 77

**Word Meaning:**

* **Anusu:** Eight *jīva-sthāna* (life-states) in five *jīva-sthāna*, one *jīva-sthāna*, one, two, *dal-das* and *moh-bandh* - in the places bound by *mohniya* karma, three times and nine, *udaya* - places of *udaya* (arising), *ling* three, fifteen - places of *samī-satā* (being).

**Meaning of the Verse:**

In eight, five and one *jīva-sthāna*, there are one, two and ten *bandha-sthāna* (places of bondage) respectively, due to the sequence of *mohniya* karma. There are three, four and nine *udaya-sthāna* (places of arising) and three, three and fifteen *satā-sthāna* (places of being).

**Special Meaning:**

This verse explains the *bandha*, *udaya* and *satā* places in the *jīva-sthāna* bound by *mohniya* karma. It also indicates the number of *jīva-sthāna*, *bandha-sthāna*, *udaya-sthāna* and *satā-sthāna*, i.e., how many *bandha-sthāna* are there in how many *jīva-sthāna*, how many *udaya-sthāna* are there, and how many *satā-sthāna* are there. However, it does not specify which ones they are. Therefore, its explanation is given below.

There are one, two and ten *bandha-sthāna* in eight, five and one *jīva-sthāna* respectively. This means that there is one *bandha-sthāna* in eight *jīva-sthāna*, two *bandha-sthāna* in five *jīva-sthāna* and ten *bandha-sthāna* in one *jīva-sthāna*. Of these, the fact that there is one *bandha-sthāna* in the first eight *jīva-sthāna* is explained as follows:

* *Paryāpta-sukshma-ekendriya* (sufficiently subtle one-sensed), *aparyāpta-sukshma-ekendriya* (insufficiently subtle one-sensed), *aparyāpta-bādar-ekendriya* (insufficiently coarse one-sensed), *aparyāpta-dvīndriya* (insufficiently two-sensed), *aparyāpta-trīndriya* (insufficiently three-sensed), *aparyāpta-chaturindriya* (insufficiently four-sensed), *aparyāpta-asanjñī-panchendriya* (insufficiently non-conscious five-sensed) and *aparyāpta-sanjñī-panchendriya* (insufficiently conscious five-sensed) - these eight *jīva-sthāna* have the first *mithyā-dṛṣṭi* (false belief) *guṇa-sthāna* (quality-state). Therefore, they have twenty-two *prakṛti* (natural) *bandha-sthāna*. These twenty-two *prakṛti* are as follows: *mithyātv* (false belief), *ananta-anubandhī-kaṣāya-chatuṣka* (four *kaṣāya* (passions) that are not bound by *anubandha* (attachment)), etc., sixteen *kaṣāya*, one of the three *veda* (scripture), *hāsa-rati* (joy of laughter) and *śoka-arati* (sorrow of desire) - one of each pair.

## Sixth Karma Granth

223. A pair, fear and disgust. In this bondage, there are six breaks in comparison to three Vedas and two pairs.

In the five living states, two bondage states should be known as follows: sufficient badar one-sensory, sufficient two-sensory, sufficient three-sensory, sufficient four-sensory, and sufficient non-sentient five-sensory. In these five living states, there are 22 natural and 21 natural, these are the two bondage states. The names of the twenty-two natures have been mentioned earlier, and by reducing Mithyatva from them, there becomes a 21 natural bondage state. Their Mithyatva is the quality state, therefore, they are called 22 natural bondage states. And since the Saasadan Samyagdristi beings are born in these living states after death, therefore, their 21 natural bondage states are explained.

Of these, there are 6 breaks in the 22 natural bondage states, which have been explained earlier, and there are 4 breaks in the 21 natural bondage states. Because the bondage of the neuter Veda is due to Mithyalbodaya, and since Mithyatva does not arise here, the bondage of the neuter Veda also does not occur. Therefore, only four breaks are possible in comparison to the remaining two Vedas - male and female, and two pairs.

Bhab is a sentient five-sensory sufficient living state, so there are ten bondage states of the 22 natural, etc., mohaniya in it. The nature and number of the aforementioned ten bondage states have been explained in the context of the bondage states of mohaniya karma, which should be understood from there. Now, the arising states of mohaniya karma in the living states are explained as follows: 'Tig Chav Nav Udaygae' - there are three arising states in eight living states, four in five living states, and nine in one living state. In the eight living states of sufficient subtle one-sensory, etc., there are eight, nine, and ten natural, this...

## Chapter 73

There are three types of *udayasthanas* (stages of arising). It should be known that although there are seven natural *udayasthanas* without the arising of any of the four *anantanubandhi* (infinitely connected) in the *mithyadrishti* (false belief) *gunasthan* (quality stage), they are not found in these eight *jivasthanas* (stages of life). Because the being who becomes *mithyadrishti* after falling from the *upshamshreni* (stage of pacification) gradually, does not have a decrease of one *avali* (cycle) in the *mithyadrishti* *gunasthan*. But the beings who have these *jivasthanas* do not ascend to the *upshamshreni*, therefore, seven natural *udayasthanas* are not possible for them.

In the aforementioned eight *jivasthanas*, there are eight natural *udayasthanas* due to the combination of *napuṁsaka* (neuter) *veda* (knowledge), *mithyatva* (false belief) *kṣaya* (passion) quartet, and one of the two pairs. In this *udayasthan*, there are eight *bhanga* (divisions) because in these *jivasthanas*, only *napuṁsaka* *veda* arises, not *puruṣaved* (male knowledge) and *strīved* (female knowledge). Therefore, there is no possibility of an alternative *veda* here, but there are alternatives in the four *kṣayas* like anger, etc., and the two pairs. So, there are eight *bhanga* due to their alternatives.

In this eight natural *udayasthan*, if fear and disgust are combined with alternatives, then there is a natural *udayasthan*. Here, there are eight *bhanga* for each alternative, so multiplying eight by two, there are sixteen *bhanga*. That is, there are sixteen *bhanga* of nine natural *udayasthanas*. In the eight natural *udayasthanas*, if fear and disgust are combined simultaneously, then there is a tenth natural *udayasthan*. This is of only one type, therefore, there are the aforementioned eight *bhanga*. Thus, there are a total of 32 *bhanga* of all three *udayasthanas*, which are obtained separately in each *jivasthan*.

It has been said that in each of the five *jivasthanas* of *paryāpta* (sufficient) *bādar* (blind), *ekendriya* (one-sensed), etc., there are four *udayasthanas* - seven, eight, nine, and ten natural. So...

## Sixth Karma Granth, Chapter 8

In the case of the *Sāsādan* state, there are 21 natural *bandhasthāna* and 10, 3, and 3 *udayastāna*. In the case of 22 natural *bandhasthāna*, there are 8, 6, and 10 *udayastāna*. In these *jīvasthāna*, only a *napumsakaved* arises. Therefore, here also, there are 7, 8, and 10 natural *udayastāna* with 8, 16, and *bhang* respectively. Similarly, there will be 8, 6, and 10 natural *udayastāna* with 8, 16, and *bhang* respectively. However, according to the *Cūrṇikāra*, in the case of *asangñī labdhi paryāpta*, one of the three *vedas* arises according to its suitability. Therefore, according to this view, in the seven initial *udayastāna* of *asangñī labdhi paryāpta*, there are *g* instead of *rang*.

## Chapter 8, Verse 225

In the *paryāpta saññī pañcendriya jīvasthāna*, there are *udayastāna* which have been mentioned in the context of *mohaniya karma* *udayastāna*. Therefore, they should be understood from there.

In the *jīvasthāna*, the *sattāsthāna* of *mohaniya karma* should be understood as follows: "Three in eight, three in five, and fifteen in one." This means that there are three *sattāsthāna* in each of the eight *jīvasthāna*, three in each of the five *jīvasthāna*, and fifteen in one *jīvasthāna*. In each of the aforementioned eight *jīvasthāna*, there are 25, 27, and 26 natural *sattāsthāna*. This is because no other *sattāsthāna* are found in the *mithyādr̥ṣṭi guṇasthāna* besides these three. Similarly, in the *paryāpta bādar ekendriya* and other five *jīvasthāna*, 28, 27, and 26 natural *sattāsthāna* should be understood. And in one *paryāpta saññī pañcendriya*, there are all fifteen *sattāsthāna*. This is because all *guṇasthāna* are present in this *jīvasthāna*.

## Translation:

**226**

After stating the separate arising and being-states in the seven realms of existence, we now state their consciousness. In the eight realms of existence, there is one 22-natured bondage-state, and within it there are 8, 9, and 10-natured arising-states, and in each arising-state there are 28, 27, and 26-natured being-states. Thus, there are a total of nine destructions in each of the eight realms of existence. In the five realms of existence, there are two bondage-states: 22-natured and 21-natured. In the 22-natured bondage-state, there are three arising-states: 8, 9, and 10-natured, and in each arising-state there are three being-states: 28, 27, and 26-natured. Thus, there are a total of nine destructions. In the 21-natured bondage-state, there are three arising-states: 7, 8, and 6-natured, and in each arising-state there is one 28-natured being-state. Thus, in the 21-natured bondage-state, there are three being-states in relation to three arising-states. In relation to both bondage-states, there are 12 destructions in each realm of existence.

The reason for considering one 28-natured being-state in the 21-natured bondage-state is that the 21-natured bondage-state occurs in the Sasadan guna-sthana, and the Sasadan guna-sthana is only for the being with 28-natured being-state, because the being of the Sasadan Samyagdrsti has the being of the Darshanamohatrika. Therefore, the 28-natured being-state is considered in the 21-natured bondage-state.

The consciousness of the bondage-states, beginning with the bondage of the Mohaniya karma in the one-sense-faculty realm, should be understood as stated earlier.

**One-twenty-one bondage is obtained by those who attain the Sasadin state, and the Sasadan must have twenty-eight karmas. Because of the destruction of their Darshanayika, their being-state is also twenty-eight.** - Sapttatika Prakarana Tika, p. 200

## Chapter 226

After explaining the bondage, arising, and existence states of the Mohaniya Karma in the seven categories of living beings, we now explain the destruction of the Name Karma.

**Verse 37:**

* **Pan Dug Panag** - Five, two, five
* **Pan Chav Panag** - Five, four, five
* **Panag Havanti** - Five, five, five, are
* **Tinneva** - All three (bondage, arising, and existence states)
* **Pan Chhappanag** - Five, six, five
* **Chham Chhappanag** - Six, six, five
* **Adrutth Dasag** - Eight, eight, ten, thus

**Verse 38:**

* **Satteva** - All seven
* **Apjjasā** - Insufficient
* **Sāmi** - Owner
* **Tāha** - Thus
* **Suham** - Subtle one-sense-endowed sufficient
* **Bāyarā** - Coarse one-sense-endowed sufficient
* **Cheva** - And
* **Viliviyā** - Disturbed many-sense-endowed sufficient
* **Timni** - Immersed
* **Tāha** - Thus
* **Ya** - And
* **Asammi** - Non-conscious five-sense-endowed sufficient
* **Sanni** - Conscious five-sense-endowed sufficient

**Commentary:**

* Five, two, five; five, four, five; five, five, five; five, six, five; six, six, five; and eight, eight, ten; these are the bondage, arising, and existence states.
* In order, the owner should know the seven insufficient, subtle one-sense-endowed sufficient, coarse one-sense-endowed sufficient, disturbed many-sense-endowed sufficient, non-conscious five-sense-endowed sufficient, and conscious five-sense-endowed sufficient living beings.

**Special Note:**

These two verses discuss the destruction of Name Karma in the living beings. The first verse takes a group of three numbers, where the first number represents the bondage state, the second... 

Page #267:
---------------------------
## The Six Karma Categories and Their Distribution in the Fourteen Realms

The third number in the verse represents the number of **udayasthanas**, and the third number represents the number of **sattastahnas**. There are a total of six such groups of numbers in the verse. The second verse divides the fourteen realms of existence into six parts. This implies that the realms of the first part belong to the first group, the realms of the second part belong to the second group, and so on.

Although the verses indicate the number of **bandhastahnas**, **udayastahnas**, and **sattastahnas** in each realm, they do not specify which ones they are or how many of each type are present. Therefore, we will discuss this in detail here, following the commentary of Acharya Malayagiri.

By combining the verses "**Paṇ duṛgā paṇagaṁ satteva apjjaṭṭā**" in the appropriate order, we arrive at one conclusion. This means that each of the seven **aparāpta** realms has five **bandhastahnas**, two **udayastahnas**, and five **sattastahnas**. This is explained as follows: the seven types of **aparāpta** beings bind the **prakrtis** that are suitable for the human and animal realms, but not the **prakrtis** that are suitable for the heavenly and hellish realms. Therefore, these seven **aparāpta** realms do not have 28, 31, and 1 **prakrtik bandhastahnas**, but rather 23, 25, 26, 26, and 30 **prakrtik bandhastahnas**. These five **bandhastahnas** also bind only the **prakrtis** suitable for the human and animal realms. A detailed discussion of these **bandhastahnas** will be provided when we discuss the **bandhastahnas** of **nāmakarma**. Therefore, you should understand it from there. Here, considering all the **bandhastahnas** together, each realm has 13947 **bhangas**. 

Page #268:
---------------------------
## Chapter 7: Seven Living States

There are two types of arising states within these seven living states: 21-natured and 24-natured. The 21-natured arising state is found in the **aparyapt** (inadequate) **badar** (gross) **ekendriya** (one-sensed) living state. It includes the following 21 natures: **tiryanch-gati** (transmigration), **tiryanch-anupurvi** (transmigratory lineage), **tejas** (fire element), **karman** (karma), **aguru-laghu** (heavy-light), **varna-chaturshka** (four colors), **ekendriya-jati** (one-sensed species), **sthavar** (stationary), **badar** (gross), **aparyapt** (inadequate), **sthira** (stable), **asthira** (unstable), **shubha** (auspicious), **ashubha** (inauspicious), **durbhag** (misfortune), **anadeya** (unworthy), **ayash-kirti** (bad reputation), and **nirman** (creation). This arising state is found in the **apantaral** (intermediate) motion. Here, there is one **bhang** (break) because the **paravartaman** (present) **shubha** (auspicious) natures do not arise.

The same applies to the **aparyapt** (inadequate) **sukshma** (subtle) **ekendriya** (one-sensed) living state. However, the difference is that in the **badar** (gross) state, the **sukshma** (subtle) nature should be considered to arise. Here too, there is one **bhang** (break).

In the 21-natured arising state, by adding the four natures of **oudarik-sharira** (spiritual body), **hund-sansthan** (body structure), **upghat** (injury), and one of **pratyek** (individual) or **sadharan** (common), and subtracting the **tiryanch-anupurvi** (transmigratory lineage) nature, we get the 24-natured arising state. This is possible in both the **sukshma** (subtle) and **badar** (gross) **ekendriya** (one-sensed) **aparyapt** (inadequate) living states. Here, there are two **bhang** (breaks) each for the **sadharan** (common) and **pratyek** (individual) **namakarma** (name-karma) in both the **sukshma** (subtle) **aparyapt** (inadequate) and **badar** (gross) **aparyapt** (inadequate) living states. Thus, there are three **bhang** (breaks) each in both living states, making a total of six **bhang** (breaks) for the two arising states.

The five living states of **vikaleindriya-trik** (three-sensed with impairment), **asanhi** (non-sentient) **aparyapt** (inadequate), and **sanjni** (sentient) **aparyapt** (inadequate) have two arising states: 21-natured and 26-natured. The 21-natured arising state in the **aparyapt** (inadequate) **dwindriya** (two-sensed) living state includes the following 21 natures: **tiryanch-gati** (transmigration), **tiryanch-anupurvi** (transmigratory lineage), **tejas** (fire element), **karman** (karma), **aguru-laghu** (heavy-light), **varna-chaturshka** (four colors), **dwindriya-jati** (two-sensed species), **bas** (dwelling), **badar** (gross), **aparyapt** (inadequate), **sthira** (stable), **asthira** (unstable), **shubha** (auspicious), **ashubha** (inauspicious), **durbhag** (misfortune), **anadeya** (unworthy), **ayash-kirti** (bad reputation), and **nirman** (creation). This arising state is found in the **apantaral** (intermediate) motion. 

Page #269:
---------------------------
## Six Karma Granth

The six karma granth exist only for the living being, not for others. Here, all the natures are unrefined, therefore, one should know only one bhang.

Similarly, in the tri-indriya and other living beings, one should know these 21 natural udya-sthana and 1 bhang. However, the special feature is that in each living being, instead of saying dvi-indriya jati, one should say shri-indriya jati, etc., according to their own jati.

After that, in the 21 natural udya-sthana, when the audarik body, audarik limbs, hunda-samsthana, seva-sanhanan, upadhat, and each of these six natures are combined and the tiryanch and anupurvi are removed, there are 26 natural udya-sthana. Here too, there is only one bhang. In this way, in the insufficient dvi-indriya and other living beings, there are two bhangs for each of the two udya-sthana.

However, the insufficient sanjni panch-indriya living being is an exception. Because the insufficient sanjni living being exists in both the tiryanch-gati and the manushya-gati. Therefore, here, four bhangs are obtained from this expectation.

In each of these seven living beings, there are five satta-sthana of 62, 58, 16, 80, and 78 natural. In the insufficient state, the satta of the tirthankara nature is not possible, therefore, in these seven living beings, 63 and 86 natural, these two satta-sthana do not exist, but since the remaining satta-sthana related to the mithya-drishti guna-sthana is possible, the aforementioned five satta-sthana are mentioned. In this way, in the seven insufficient living beings, one should know the bandha-sthana, udya-sthana, and satta-sthana of the name karma. Now, after this, 

1. Only the insufficient sanjni has four, because two bhangs of the insufficient sanjni are tiryanch, and two are of the insufficient sanjni manushya.

Sapta-tika Prakaran Toka, Page 201

---------------------------
## Chapter 73

This chapter discusses the relationship between the terms "Pau Panag" and "Suham Pad," which refer to the five bondage-places, four arising-places, and five being-places of the subtle, one-sense, sufficient living being. 

**Bondage-Places:**

The subtle, one-sense, sufficient living being, upon death, is reborn in the human or animal realm, leading to the bondage of karmas that qualify it for these realms. Therefore, its five bondage-places are considered to be 23, 25, 26, 26, and 30 naturalities. The reasons for considering these five bondage-places have been explained previously. The total number of combinations for these five places is 13617.

**Arising-Places:**

The four arising-places of the subtle, one-sense, sufficient living being are 21, 24, 25, and 26 naturalities. This is because these subtle beings do not experience the arising of the karmas called "Atap" and "Udyot." Therefore, the 27th naturality arising-place is excluded.

The 21 naturality arising-place includes the same naturalities as those experienced by the subtle, one-sense, insufficient living being. However, since the subtle, one-sense, sufficient living being is the focus here, the term "sufficient" should be used instead of "insufficient" when referring to the arising. This 21 naturality arising-place occurs in the "Apantaral" realm. Due to the absence of opposing naturalities, there is only one combination.

By combining the four naturalities of "Audarik" body, "Hund-Sansthan," "Upghat," and one naturality each from "Sadharan" and "Pratiyaka," and reducing the "Tiryanchanupurvi" naturality, the 24 naturality arising-place is achieved. This arising-place occurs for the living being residing in the body. There are two combinations due to the alternatives of "Pratiyaka" and "Sadharan."

**Being-Places:**

The 24 naturality being-place...

---------------------------
## Sixth Karma Granth, Chapter 233

When the paraghāt is added to the udayasthān, there are 25 natural udayasthāns. Here too, like the 24 pratik udayasthāns, there are two bhangas.

Adding the ucchvāsa prakriti to the udayasthān of a jīva who has become sufficient through prāṇāpāna paryāpti, there are 26 natural udayasthāns. Here too, there are the aforementioned two bhangas. Thus, in the sūkshma ekaindriya paryāpta jīvasthān, there are four udayasthāns and their seven bhangas.

Now, we will explain the sattasthāns in the sūkshma ekaindriya paryāpta jīvasthān. There are five sattasthāns in this jīvasthān. These five sattasthāns are 62, 88, 86, 80, and 78 natural. In the tiryanchgaati, there is no sattā of the tīrthankara prakriti. Therefore, the two sattasthāns, 63 and 86 natural, are not possible. Hence, there are five sattasthāns: 12, 18, 86, 80, and 78 natural.

However, when the 25 and 26 natural udayasthāns are taken along with the uday of the sādhāraṇa prakriti, the 78 natural sattasthān is not possible in this bhang. Because, except for the agnikāyik and vāyukāyik jīvas, all other jīvas bind themselves to the manushya gati and manushyanupūrvi according to the rules when they become sufficient through sharīra paryāpti. And the 25 and 26 natural udayasthāns are only for those jīvas who have become sufficient through sharīra paryāpti. Therefore, in the sādhāraṇa sūkshma ekaindriya paryāpta jīvas, the 78 natural sattasthān does not exist while the 25 and 26 udayasthāns remain.

The remaining four sattasthāns are 62, 88, 86, and 80 natural. But when the 25 and 26 natural udayasthāns are taken along with each prakriti, then the 78 natural sattasthān also becomes possible in the 25 and 26 natural udayasthāns because the agnikāyik and vāyukāyik jīvas are also included in each. 

Page #272:
---------------------------
## Chapter on Saptaatika

Thus, the summary of the aforementioned statement is that in each of the 21st and 24th Prakriti Udayasthanas, there are five Sattaasthanas each. And in each of the 25th and 26th Prakriti Udayasthanas, there are four Sattaasthanas in one respect and five in another. The reason for this difference is the ordinary and individual Prakriti, which has been explained above.

Now, following the order specified in the verse, we will explain the Bandhaadi Sthana in the Badar Ekendriya Paryapt Jeevasthana, connecting the phrase "Panaga Havanti Tinneva" with "Bayara". This means that in the Badar Ekendriya Paryapt Jeevasthana, there are five Bandhaasthanas, five Udayasthanas, and five Sattaasthanas. Their details are as follows:

The Badar Ekendriya Paryapt being in the Ni, Manumati, and Hinati, binds with the appropriate Prakritis. Therefore, it has five Bandhaasthanas, namely the 23rd, 25th, 26th, 26th, and 30th Prakritis. Accordingly, the total number of their Bhangas is 13617.

Considering the Udayasthanas, here too, there are five Udayasthanas related to Ekendriya, namely the 21st, 24th, 25th, 26th, and 27th Prakritis. Because, from the general to the Apantaral motion, the 21st Prakriti is expected, from being in the body, the 24th Prakriti is expected, from the body Paryapti to Paryapti, the 25th Prakriti is expected, and from the Pranapan Paryapti to Paryapti, the 26th Prakriti is expected. These four Udayasthanas are naturally present for the Paryapt Ekendriya. However, since this is Badar Ekendriya, the Udayasthana of either Atap or Udyot is also possible, making the 27th Prakriti Udayasthana as well. Therefore, in the Badar Ekendriya Paryapt Jeevasthana, the 21st, 24th, 25th, 26th, and 27th Prakritis are considered as the five Udayasthanas.

## The Back Karma Granth
### Chapter 235: The 21 Natural Arising Places of the Badar Ekaindriya Paryapt Jiva

There are 61 natures in the 21 natural arising places of the Badar Ekaindriya Paryapt Jiva: Tiryanch-Gati, Tiryanch-Anupurvi, Ekaindriya Jati, Sthavar, Badar, Paryapt, Tejas, Karman, Agurulghu, Sthir, Asthir, Shubh, Ashubh, Varna-Chatushk, Nirman, Dubhang, Anadeya, Yash:Kiti and Ayash:Kirti. In this arising place, Yash:Kiti and Ayash:Kirti arise alternatively. Therefore, there are two bhangs in this arising place.

In the above 21 natures, when we add the four natures of Audarik Sharira, Hund-Sansthan, Upghāt and Pratyek-Sadharan, and subtract Tiryanch-Anupurvi, we get 24 natural arising places. Here, there are four bhangs due to the alternative arising of Pratyek-Sadharan and Yash:Kiti-Ayash:Kirti. However, there is a special feature that the Badar Vayukayik Jivas, who perform actions in the body, do not have the arising of Sadharan and Yash:Kiti karmas. Therefore, there is only one bhang there. Another special feature is that these Jivas do not have the arising of Audarik Sharira, but instead have the arising of Vaikriya Sharira. Therefore, instead of Audarik Sharira, we should say Vaikriya Sharira. Thus, there are a total of five bhangs in the 24 natural arising places.

After that, by adding the Paraghāt nature to the 24 natural arising places, we get 25 natural arising places. This arising place is from the Sharira Paryapti.

1. The Vayukayik Jivas who perform actions in the body do not have the arising of Sadharan and Yash:Kirti.
2. Instead of Audarik Sharira, we should say Vaikriya Sharira for the Vaikriya Vayukayik Jivas.

## Chapter 7: The Seven Decades

**The Perfect Being**

Here, as with the 24 natural states of existence, there are five categories.

If, in the case of a perfect being, the body is perfected, and either the state of suffering (ātapa) or the state of joy (udyota) arises, then by adding either of these to the 25 natural states of existence, we get 26 natural states of existence. However, the state of suffering does not arise in the ordinary, so in this case, there are two categories with respect to fame and infamy. But the state of joy arises in both the ordinary and the universal, so in this case, there are four categories with respect to the alternatives of ordinary and universal, and fame and infamy. Thus, there are a total of 5 + 2 + 4 = 11 categories for the 26 natural states of existence.

**The Perfect Being with Breath**

Next, with respect to a perfect being with perfected breath and exhalation, by adding either the state of suffering or the state of joy to the 26 natural states of existence, we get 27 natural states of existence. Here too, as before, there are two categories with suffering and four categories with joy, for a total of six categories.

**Total Categories**

Adding the categories of these five states of existence, the total number of categories for the perfect being with one sense is 26.

**The Perfect Being with One Sense**

There are five states of existence for the perfect being with one sense: 2680 and 78 natural states. In this state of existence, the 26 categories of the five states of existence mentioned above are as follows: two categories for the 21 natural states of existence, four categories for the 24 natural states of existence except for the one category of the vacuous, badara, airy body, and one category each for the 25th and 26th natural states of existence with respect to fame and infamy. 

Page #275:
---------------------------
## The Karma Granth (Chapter 237)

Each of the eight bhangas (categories of karma) contains the five sattvasthana (states of being), but each of the remaining 21 bhangas contains only four sattvasthana, excluding the 78 natural sattvasthana.

Now, following the instructions given in the gatha (verse), we will explain the bandha (bondage) and other states, and their respective bhangas, for the vikalendriya (limited sensory) beings. The gatha instructs: "Pan panagam vigalindiya u tini u". This means that the vikalendriya beings - the dwindriya (two-sensed), trindriya (three-sensed), and chaturindriya (four-sensed) - have five bandha sthana (places of bondage), six udaya sthana (places of arising), and five sattva sthana.

Here is the explanation:

Vikalendriya beings also experience bondage of the same natural qualities that lead to the tiryanch (animal) and manushya (human) realms. Therefore, they also have five bandha sthana: 23, 25, 26, 26, and 30 natural qualities. Accordingly, they have a total of 13917 bhangas.

Considering the udaya sthana, there are six: 21, 26, 28, 26, 30, and 31 natural qualities. The 21 natural udaya sthana include: tejas (fire), karman (karma), agurulghu (heavy-light), sthira (stable), asthira (unstable), shubha (auspicious), ashubha (inauspicious), varn chatushk (four colors), nirman (creation), tiryanch gati (animal realm), tiryanch anupurvi (animal lineage), dwindriya jati (two-sensed species), sabadar (sound), paryapta (sufficient), durbhag (misfortune), anadeya (unworthy), and yasha kirti (fame) and ayasha kirti (infamy). These 21 qualities arise in the apantaral (intermediate) realm. There are two bhangas due to the alternative of yasha kirti and ayasha kirti.

Next, considering the jiva (soul) residing in the body, the 21 natural udaya sthana include: audarik sharir (physical body), audarik angopang (physical limbs), indrasansthan (sense organs), sevarta sanhanan (service-oriented aggregation), upghat (injury), and each of these six qualities combined, minus tiryanch anupurvi, resulting in 26 natural udaya sthana. Here too, like the 21 natural udaya sthana, there are two bhangas. 

Page #276:
---------------------------
## The Saptaatika Chapter

This chapter discusses the 28-natured state of being, which arises from the combination of the 26-natured state of being with the two natures of *parāghāta* (external harm) and *apraśasta vihāyoga* (unfavorable death).  Here too, there are two *bhaṅga* (divisions).

Following the 28-natured state of being, comes the 26-natured state of being. This 26-natured state of being arises in two ways: 

1. When someone who has attained *prāṇāpāna-paryāpti* (perfection of breath) experiences only *uccvāsa* (exhalation) without *udyota* (effort).
2. When someone who has attained *śarīra-paryāpti* (perfection of body) experiences *udyota* (effort).

In each of these cases, there are two *bhaṅga* (divisions) as mentioned earlier. Thus, there are a total of four *bhaṅga* (divisions) in the 20-natured state of being.

Similarly, the 30-natured state of being also arises in two ways:

1. When someone who has attained *bhāṣā-paryāpti* (perfection of speech) experiences either *susvara* (good voice) or *duḥsvara* (bad voice) without *udyota* (effort).
2. When someone who has attained *śvāsochchvāsa-paryāpti* (perfection of breathing) but not yet *bhāṣā-paryāpti* (perfection of speech) experiences *udyota* (effort).

In the first type of 30-natured state of being, there are four *bhaṅga* (divisions) due to the alternatives of *yaśaḥ-kīrti* (fame) and *ayaśaḥ-kīrti* (infamy), and *susvara* (good voice) and *duḥsvara* (bad voice). However, in the second type of 30-natured state of being, there are only two *bhaṅga* (divisions) due to the alternatives of *yaśaḥ-kīrti* (fame) and *ayaśaḥ-kīrti* (infamy). Thus, there are a total of six *bhaṅga* (divisions) in the 30-natured state of being.

Therefore, when *uccvāsa* (exhalation) occurs in someone who has attained *prāṇāpāna-paryāpti* (perfection of breath), it leads to the 29-natured state of being. There are two *bhaṅga* (divisions) in this state. Alternatively, when *udyota* (effort) occurs in the 28-natured state of being without *uccvāsa* (exhalation), it leads to the 29-natured state of being.

### 236

The two types of 30 natural उदयस्थान (stages of arising) mentioned above, if one has attained language पर्याप्ति (perfection) and also has the arising of उयोत (a type of karma), then they have 31 natural उदयस्थान. Here, there are four भङ्ग (divisions) due to the alternatives of यशःकीति (fame) and अयशःकीति (infamy) and both the sounds. Thus, the total भङ्ग of all उदयस्थान of पर्याप्त द्वीन्द्रिय (two-sensed) are 20.

In the पर्याप्त द्वीन्द्रिय जीवस्थान (state of being) also, there are five सत्तास्थान (states of existence) like the एकेन्द्रिय (one-sensed), which are 62, 88, 86, 80, and 78 natural. Out of the 20 भङ्ग mentioned earlier for the six उदयस्थान, there are two भङ्ग for 21 natural उदयस्थान and two भङ्ग for 26 natural उदयस्थान. In each of these four भङ्ग, there are five सत्तास्थान because the अग्निकायिक (fire-bodied) and वायुकायिक (air-bodied) जीव who are पर्याप्त द्वीन्द्रिय and have 78 natural सत्ता, they can have 78 natural सत्ता for some time, and during this time, they have 21 and 26 natural उदयस्थान respectively. Therefore, in each of these four भङ्ग of these two उदयस्थान, there are five सत्तास्थान mentioned. And apart from these four भङ्ग, the remaining 16 भङ्ग do not have 78 natural सत्तास्थान, so each of them has four सत्तास्थान. Because, except for the अग्निकायिक and वायुकायिक जीव, the rest of the जीव, after becoming पर्याप्त from शरीर पर्याप्ति (perfection of body), bind according to the rule, मनुष्यगति (human path) and मनुष्यानुपूर्वी (human-like), due to which they do not attain 78 natural सत्तास्थान.

Like पर्याप्त द्वीन्द्रिय जीव, one should also know the बंधादि स्थान (places of bondage etc.) and their भङ्ग for पर्याप्त त्रीन्द्रिय (three-sensed) and पर्याप्त चतुरिन्द्रिय (four-sensed) जीव. One should know this particularity that in the उदयस्थान, instead of द्वीन्द्रिय, त्रीन्द्रिय and चतुरिन्द्रिय should be mentioned.

## Chapter of Seven Tika

This section now discusses the various states of existence of the limited soul (Paryāpta Jīva) and their respective bonds (Bandha) and their breaking (Bhang). The verses state: "Lachappana" and "Asanni Ya" - meaning that there are six bond-states, six arising-states, and five states of existence for the non-conscious five-sense limited soul. 

This means that the non-conscious five-sense limited soul, upon binding, is capable of attaining the human (Manushya) and animal (Tiryanch) realms. However, it can also bind to the states of hell (Naraka) and heaven (Deva). Therefore, there are six bond-states with 23, 25, 26, 28, 26, and 30 karmic influences, resulting in 13626 possible breakings.

Considering the arising-states, there are six with 21, 26, 28, 29, 30, and 31 karmic influences. The arising-state with 21 karmic influences includes one each from the following: 

* **Tejas:** (Brightness)
* **Karmāṇa:** (Karma)
* **Agurulaghu:** (Heavy and Light)
* **Sthira:** (Stable)
* **Asthira:** (Unstable)
* **Shubha:** (Auspicious)
* **Ashubha:** (Inauspicious)
* **Varna Chatushk:** (Four Castes)
* **Nirmana:** (Creation)
* **Tiryanchgati:** (Animal Realm)
* **Tiryanchānupūrvi:** (Animal Ancestry)
* **Panchendriya Jāti:** (Five-sense Being)
* **Pras:** (Praise)
* **Bādar:** (Blame)
* **Paryāpta:** (Limited)
* **Subhaga:** (Fortunate)
* **Durbhaga:** (Unfortunate)
* **Ādeya:** (Worthy of Respect)
* **Anādeya:** (Unworthy of Respect)
* **Yashaḥkīti:** (Fame and Glory)
* **Ayashaḥkīti:** (Shame and Disgrace)

This arising-state with 21 karmic influences is found only in the Apāntarāla realm. Each of the three pairs (Subhaga, etc.) has eight possible breakings based on the variations of each influence.

After the soul takes on a body, it experiences the arising of one each from the following:

* **Audārika Shārīra:** (Physical Body)
* **Audārika Angopānga:** (Physical Limbs)
* **Sansthāna:** (State of Existence)
* **Sanhanana:** (Six Types of Binding)
* **Upadhāta:** (Supporting Influence)

However, the influence of "Tiryanchānupūrvi" (Animal Ancestry) does not arise here. Therefore, by adding these six influences to the previous 21 and removing "Tiryanchānupūrvi," we get an arising-state with 26 karmic influences. There are also six states of existence and six types of binding...

## Sixth Karma Granth

**In comparison to the 241 Su-bhag-trika, the aforementioned 8 bhangas, when multiplied by six twice, result in 6x6x8 = 288 bhangas.**

**Subsequently, upon the body's attainment of paryaapti, either para-ghat or prashasta viha-yogati or aprashasta viha-yogati arises. Therefore, adding these two prakritis to the 26 natural udya-sthana, we get 28 natural udya-sthana.**

**Here, considering the alternative of both viha-yogatis, the aforementioned 288 bhangas, when multiplied by two, become 288x2 = 576.**

**The 26 natural udya-sthana occur in two ways: one, obtained solely from the rise of ucchvasa without udya-ot, for one who has completed the an-pran paryaapti; and two, obtained from the rise of udya-ot prakriti upon the completion of the body's paryaapti.**

**In each of these two sthana, there are 576 bhangas. Therefore, the total bhangas for the 26 natural udya-sthana are 576x26 = 1152.**

**The 30 natural udya-sthana is also obtained in two ways: one, obtained from the rise of either su-svara or du-svara prakriti without udya-ot, for one who has completed the bhasha paryaapti; and two, obtained upon the rise of udya-ot, for one who has completed the shvas-occhvas paryaapti.**

**In the first type of sthana, the aforementioned 576 bhangas, when multiplied by svara-dvik, result in 1152 bhangas. And in the second type of sthana, there are 576 bhangas.**

**Thus, the total bhangas for the 30 natural udya-sthana are 1152+576 = 1728.**

**Subsequently, for one who has completed the bhasha paryaapti and also has the rise of udya-ot prakriti, there is the 31st natural udya-sthana.** 

Page #280:
---------------------------
## The Chapter of Saratta

Here, there are a total of 1152 bhangas. Thus, there are a total of 4604 bhangas in all the udayasthanas of the Asanji Panchendriya Paryapta Jeevasthana. _The Asanji Panchendriya Paryapta Jeevasthana has five sattasthanas of 62, 88, 86, 80, and 78 prakrutis. Out of these, there are 8 bhangas for the 21 prakrutik udayasthanas and 288 bhangas for the 26 prakrutik udayasthanas. Each of these bhangas has the aforementioned five sattasthanas. Because the Agnicayik and Vayukayik Jeevas, who have 78 prakrutis of sattva, if they are born in the Asanji Panchendriya Paryaptakas, then it is possible for them to have 78 prakrutik sattasthanas while having 21 and 26 prakrutik udayasthanas. But, apart from these, the remaining udayasthanas and their bhangas have only four sattasthanas, excluding 78._

Thus, the consideration of the bandhadi sthana and their bhangas of the thirteen Jeevasthanas, named by karma, has been done. Now, we will point out the bandhadi sthana and bhangas of the fourteenth, Sanji Panchendriya Paryapta Jeevasthana. The gatha has indicated the bandhadi sthana for this Jeevasthana - 'Atthaththadasagan ti sanni ya', meaning that the Sanji Panchendriya Paryapta Jeevasthana has eight bandhasthana, one aalan udayasthana, and ten sattasthanas. Their explanation is given below.

The eight bandhasthana are mentioned as 23, 25, 26, 28, 26, 30, 31, and 1 prakrutik. These eight bandhasthana belong to the Sanji Panchendriya Paryapta Jeevas and there are 13645 possible bhangas for them. Because the bandha of their four gati-related prakrutis is possible, therefore, 23 prakrutik, etc., bandhasthana are mentioned for them. The bandha of Tirthankara name and Aharak Chatushk also occurs for them, therefore, 31 prakrutik bandhasthana is mentioned. Both Upshama and Kshapak categories are found in this Jeevasthana, therefore, 1 prakrutik bandhasthana is also mentioned.

## Sixth Karma Granth

**Regarding the consideration of the 243 Udayasthanas, the 20, H, and 8 Prakruti are related to the Kevali, and the 24 Prakruti Udayasthanas are of the Ekendriya. Therefore, in this Jiva-sthana, except for these four Udayasthanas of 20, 24, 6, and 8 Prakruti, the remaining Jiva-sthana is found only up to the 12th Gunasthana. The 21, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31 Prakruti, these eight Udayasthanas are found. The total Bhang of these eight Udayasthanas is 7671. Because the total Bhang of the 12 Udayasthanas is 7761, 120 Bhang are reduced from them, because those Bhang are not related to the Sanni Panchaindriya Paryapta Jiva.**

**The Satta-sthana of Namakarma are 12, out of which the H and 8 Prakruti Satta-sthana are found in the Kevali, therefore, they are not possible in the Sanni Panchaindriya Jiva-sthana, so in addition to them, the 63, 62, 61, 88, 86, 80, 76, 78, 75, and 74 Prakruti, these ten Satta-sthana are found. Out of the 8 and 288 Bhang of the 21 and 26 Prakruti Udayasthanas respectively, in each Bhang, the 12, 88, 86, 80, and 76 Prakruti, these five Satta-sthana are found.**

**In Go. Karmakanda Gatha 676, the 63, 62, 61, 60, 59, 54, 52, 51, 76, 78, 77, 10, and 9 Prakruti, these 13 Satta-sthana are mentioned. Out of these, except for the 10 and 9 Prakruti Satta-sthana, the remaining 11 Satta-sthana are mentioned in the Sanni Panchaindriya Jiva-sthana - Dasanavaparihina Sanvyam Mattam. ||706||**

**In the Shwetambar and Digambar Karmagyas, the following Satta-sthana of Namakarma are of the same Prakruti, 63, 62, 88, 80, 76, 78, and 61 Prakruti, and the number of Prakruti in the remaining Satta-sthana is different. In the Shwetambar Karmagranths, the 86, 85, 75, and 74 Prakruti, and in the Digambar literature, the 61, 60, 84, 82, 77, and 10 Prakruti Satta-sthana are mentioned.**

## Chapter 244

The consideration of the fourteen states of existence of living beings, including the states of bondage and their dissolution, has been discussed. Now, let's consider their interrelationship.

For subtle one-sensed insufficient living beings, there are 23 natural states of bondage and 21 natural states of liberation. Within these, there are five states of existence: 62, 88, 86, 60, and 78. Similarly, there are five states of existence within the 24 natural states of liberation. In total, there are ten states of existence for both liberation states. Likewise, for those living beings who bind 25, 26, 26, and 30 natural qualities, there are ten states of existence for each of their two liberation states, totaling 50. Similarly, for the remaining one-sensed insufficient beings, such as the dull one-sensed insufficient, it is important to know their 50 states of existence, but it should be understood that they have two liberation states each.

For subtle one-sensed sufficient living beings, there are five states of bondage: 23, 25, 26, 26, and 30 natural qualities. Each state of bondage has four states of liberation: 21, 24, 25, and 26 natural qualities. Therefore, multiplying five by four gives us 20. Each liberation state has five states of existence, so multiplying 20 by five gives us 100 states of existence for subtle one-sensed sufficient living beings.

For dull one-sensed sufficient living beings, there are also five states of bondage: 23, 25, 26, 27, and 30 natural qualities. Each state of bondage has five states of liberation: 21, 24, 25, 26, and 27 natural qualities. Therefore, multiplying five by five gives us 25. Of these, the last five liberation states have four states of existence each, totaling 20. The remaining 20 liberation states have five states of existence each, totaling 100. Thus, there are a total of 120 states of existence here.

For two-sensed sufficient living beings, there are five states of bondage: 23, 25, 26, 27, and 30 natural qualities.

## Sixth Karma Granth

There are five Bandha-sthana (bond-places) and each Bandha-sthana has six Udaya-sthana (arising-places) namely 21, 26, 28, 29, 30 and 31 Prakruti (nature). Out of these, the Udaya-sthana of 21 and 26 Prakruti have five Satya-sthana (being-places) each, while the remaining four Udaya-sthana have four Satya-sthana each, except for 78 Prakruti Satya-sthana. In total, there are 26 Satya-sthana. Thus, there are 130 Bhang (breakings) for five Bandha-sthana.

One should know the Bandha-sthana etc. of Tri-Indriya (three-sense) and Chatur-Indriya (four-sense) Paryapta (sufficient) like Dwi-Indriya (two-sense) Paryapta, and they also have 130, 130 Bhang.

In the Asanjni (non-conscious) Pancha-Indriya (five-sense) Paryapta Jiva-sthana (living being place), there are five Bandha-sthana namely 23, 25, 26, 26 and 30 Prakruti. Each Bandha-sthana has long Bhang like Vikleindriya (disabled sense) which totals 130. However, in the 28 Prakruti Bandha-sthana, there are only two Udaya-sthana namely 30 and 31 Prakruti. Therefore, each Udaya-sthana has three Satya-sthana namely 62, 88 and 86 Prakruti. There are a total of six Bhang here. The reason for having three Satya-sthana here is that the 28 Prakruti Bandha-sthana is only for the binding of Prakruti suitable for Devagati (heavenly path) and Narakagati (hellish path) Paryapta. Similarly, in the Asanjni Pancha-Indriya Paryapta Jiva-sthana, there are 130 + 6 = 136 Bhang.

In the 23 Prakruti Bandha-sthana of Sanjni (conscious) Pancha-Indriya Paryapta, one should know like the 26 Satya-sthana of Asanjni Pancha-Indriya Paryapta.

## Chapter 7: 

**246**

In the 25 **Prakruti** **Bandha** **Sthana**, there are 8 **Udaya** **Sthana** which are: 21, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31 **Prakruti**. Out of these, **Prakruti** 21 and 26 have 5 **Satta** **Sthana** each, while **Prakruti** 25 and 27 are only for **Devas**, hence they have 2 **Satta** **Sthana** each, totaling 62 and 85 **Prakruti** respectively. The remaining 4 **Udaya** **Sthana** have 4 **Satta** **Sthana** each, with 78 **Prakruti** in each. Thus, there are a total of 30 **Satta** **Sthana** here. Similarly, there are 30 **Satta** **Sthana** in the 26 **Prakruti** **Bandha** **Sthana**.

In the 28 **Prakruti** **Bandha** **Sthana**, there are 8 **Udaya** **Sthana**. Out of these, 6 **Udaya** **Sthana** (21, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29 **Prakruti**) have 2 **Satta** **Sthana** each, totaling 62 and 85 **Prakruti**. The 30 **Prakruti** **Udaya** **Sthana** has 4 **Satta** **Sthana** with 12, 18, 16, and 80 **Prakruti**. The 31 **Prakruti** **Udaya** **Sthana** has 3 **Satta** **Sthana** with 32, 88, and 86 **Prakruti**. Thus, there are a total of 16 **Satta** **Sthana** here.

The 26 **Prakruti** **Bandha** **Sthana** has 30 **Prakruti** **Satta** **Sthana**, similar to those who bind 25 **Prakruti**. However, there is a difference. When a **Samyagdrishti** human, who is constantly on the path of **Deva** **Gati**, binds 26 **Prakruti**, they have 5 **Udaya** **Sthana** (21, 26, 28, 29, and 30 **Prakruti**), and each **Udaya** **Sthana** has 2 **Satta** **Sthana** with 63 and 86 **Prakruti**, totaling 10.

Similarly, **Samyata** and **Samyata** **Samyata** beings, when they bind 26 **Prakruti**, have 2 **Satta** **Sthana** (25 and 27 **Prakruti**), and each **Udaya** **Sthana** has 2 **Satta** **Sthana** with 93 and 86 **Prakruti**, totaling 4. Alternatively, **Aharaka** **Samyata** also have 93 **Prakruti** **Satta** in these two **Udaya** **Sthana**, while **Mithyadrishti** with **Tirthankara** **Prakruti** **Satta** have 86 **Satta**. 

Page #285:
---------------------------
## Back Karma Granth

**Chapter 1:**

When the 14 **Sattastahan** (states of existence) of the **Pashth** (back) are added to the previous 30 **Sattastahan**, there are a total of 44 **Sattastahan** in the 26 **Prakrutik Bandhastan** (natural bondage states).

Similarly, in the 30 **Prakrutik Bandhastan**, 30 **Sattastahan** should be included, as in the 25 **Prakrutik Bandhastan**. However, there is a special feature here: when the 30 **Prakrutis** (natures) suitable for the human realm are bound with the **Tirthankara** and **Prakruti**, there are six **Udayasthan** (arising states) - 21, 25, 27, 28, 26, and 31 **Prakrutis**. Each **Udayasthan** has two **Sattastahan** - 63 and 86 **Prakrutis**. The total of these is 12. When these are added to the aforementioned 30, there are a total of 42 **Sattastahan** in the 30 **Prakrutik Bandhastan**.

In the 31 **Prakrutik Bandhastan**, the **Tirthankara** and **Aharakadvik** (those who consume food) have **Dharma** (righteousness). Therefore, there are 63 **Pravrittis** (tendencies) here, and there are 8 **Sattastahan** when one **Prakrutik Bandha** occurs. Of these, four **Sattastahan** - 13, 62, 89, and 6 **Prakrutis** - are in **Upshamni** (subduing), and four **Sattastahan** - 80, 76, 76, and 75 **Prakrutis** - are in **Kshapakni** (destroying).

Even in the absence of **Bandha** (bondage), the **Sanjni Panchendriya** (conscious five-sensed) **Paryapt** (sufficient) has the aforementioned eight **Sattastahan**. Of these, the first four **Sattastahan** are attained in the eleventh **Gunasthan** (state of virtue) - **Upshantamoha** (subdued delusion), and the last four **Sattastahan** are attained in the twelfth **Gunasthan** - **Kshina Moha** (diminished delusion). Thus, the **Sanjni Panchendriya Paryapt** being has a total of 208 **Sattastahan**.

Due to the association with **Dravyaman** (substance-mind), even the **Kevali** (omniscient) is considered **Sanjni**. Therefore, they also have 26 **Sattastahan**. Because the **Kevali** has ten **Udayasthan** - 20, 21, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 6, and 8 **Prakrutis**. Of these, the **Udayasthan** of 20 **Prakrutis** has two **Sattastahan** - 76 and 75 **Prakrutis**, and the **Udayasthan** of 26 and 28 **Prakrutis** also have the same... 

Page #286:
---------------------------
## The Chapter of the Seven Tika

Two **satta-sthana** (states of being) should be known. In the **udaya-sthana** (state of arising) of 21 and 27 **prakriti** (natural qualities), there are 80 and 76 **prakriti**, these are two **satta-sthana**. In the **udaya-sthana** of 26 **prakriti**, there are 80, 76, 76 and 75 **prakriti**, these are four **satta-sthana**. Because the **udaya-sthana** of 26 **prakriti** is attained by both **tirthankara** (liberated soul) and **samanya kevali** (ordinary liberated soul). Among them, if a **tirthankara** has 29 **prakriti** **udaya-sthana**, then there will be 80 and 76 **prakriti**, these are two **satta-sthana**. And if an **ordinary kevali** has 26 **prakriti** **udaya-sthana**, then there will be 76 and 75 **prakriti**, these are two **satta-sthana**. Similarly, four **satta-sthana** are attained in the **udaya-sthana** of 30 **prakriti**. In the **udaya-sthana** of 31 **prakriti**, there are 80 and 76 **prakriti**, these are two **satta-sthana**, because this **udaya-sthana** is only for **tirthankara kevali**. In the **udaya-sthana** of 6 **prakriti**, there are 80, 76 and 6 **prakriti**, these are three **satta-sthana**. Among these, the first two **satta-sthana** occur until the end of the **ayogika-kevali** (non-perfected liberated soul) **guna-sthana** (state of qualities) for a **tirthankara**, and the last 6 **prakriti** **satta-sthana** occur at the end of the **ayogika-kevali** **guna-sthana**. In the **udaya-sthana** of 5 **prakriti**, there are 76, 75 and 8 **prakriti**, these are three **satta-sthana**. Among these, the first two **satta-sthana** (76, 75) are attained by an **ordinary kevali** until the end of the **ayogika-kevali** **guna-sthana**, and the last 8 **prakriti** **satta-sthana** is attained at the end. In this way, there are 26 **satta-sthana**.

Now, if these are included in the aforementioned 200 **satta-sthana**, then there are a total of 234 **satta-sthana** in the **sanjnee panchendriya paryaapt jeeva-sthana** (state of being of a sentient five-sensed being with sufficient karma).

The description of the **nama-karma** (karma of name) **bandha-sthana** (state of bondage), **udaya-sthana** and their **bhang** (destruction) in the fourteen **jeeva-sthana** (states of being) is as follows. First, we will explain the **bandha-sthana** and their **bhang**.

## Chapter 254: The Seven Tika

Having described the binding, arising, and existence locations of the eight karmas in the fourteen living states, and their dissolution, we now discuss the dissolution of karmas in the ten qualities.

**Dissolution of Karmas in the Ten Qualities**

First, we discuss the binding, arising, and existence locations of the knowledge-obscuring and obstructing karmas in the ten qualities.

**Naanantray Tivimiy Dasu Vo Honti Dosu Thaanesu**

**Meaning:** Naanantray - knowledge-obscuring and obstructing karmas, Tivimiy - in three ways (with respect to binding, arising, and existence), Dasu - in the ten qualities, Dosu - two (arising and existence), Honti - exists, Dosu - two (in Upshantamoha and Ksheenamoha), Thaanesu - in the qualities.

**Verse Meaning:** In the first ten qualities, the knowledge-obscuring and obstructing karmas are of three types with respect to binding, arising, and existence, and are of two types with respect to arising and existence in two qualities (Upshantamoha and Ksheenamoha).

**Detailed Meaning:** Previously, the binding, arising, and existence locations of the eight karmas in the fourteen living states, and their dissolution were discussed. Now, we discuss them in the ten qualities.

The rule regarding the knowledge-obscuring and obstructing karmas is that the binding of all five types of knowledge-obscuring and five types of obstructing karmas is dissolved at the end of the tenth subtle-perception quality, and their arising and existence are dissolved at the end of the twelfth Ksheenamoha quality. Therefore, it is established that from the first Mithyadrishti quality to the tenth quality, the knowledge-obscuring and obstructing karmas are present in all ten qualities.

##  The Karma Granth, Page 255

**Bondage, Arising, and Existence of the Five Karmas**

These three - bondage, arising, and existence of the five karmas - are present in the first ten *gunasthānas* (stages of spiritual development). However, in the tenth *gunasthāna*, the bondage of both *jñānāvaraṇa* (knowledge-obscuring karma) and *antarāya* (hindrance karma) is severed. Consequently, in the eleventh and twelfth *gunasthānas*, only the arising and existence of the five karmas remain, as *upashāntamoh* (subdued delusion) and *kṣīṇamoh* (diminished delusion) are present. 

Beyond the twelfth *gunasthāna*, in the thirteenth and fourteenth *gunasthānas*, the bondage, arising, and existence of these two karmas are absent. Therefore, none of these three aspects of karma are found.

After explaining the bondage, etc., of *jñānāvaraṇa* and *antarāya* karma, we now discuss the destruction of *darśanāvaraṇa* karma.

**Verse 36:**

"In *mithyātva* (false belief) and *sāmāna* (common) *gunasthānas*, there are four or five *navanau* (types of *darśanāvaraṇa* karma) and their existence."

**Verse 40:**

"From the *miśra* (mixed) *gunasthāna* to the *apūrvakaraṇa* (unprepared) *gunasthāna*, there are four or five *navanau* and their existence, as well as the bondage of four *navanau*."

**Explanation of Terms:**

* *Miśśāsaṇe* - In *mithyātva* and *sāmāna* *gunasthānas*.
* *Bīe* - Of the other karma.
* *Nabanau* - Four or five *navanau*.
* *Y* - And.
* *Sansā* - Existence.
* *Miśśai* - From the *miśra* *gunasthāna*.
* *Niyaṭṭo* - To the *apūrvakaraṇa* *gunasthāna*.
* *Chapaṇ* - Six.
* *Chha* - Four or five.
* *Nava* - Nine.
* *Y* - And.
* *Santakammānsā* - Existence of *darśanāvaraṇa* karma.
* *Chajbandh* - Bondage of four *navanau*.
* *Tige* - Four.

**Footnotes:**

1. In the first ten *gunasthānas*, there are five types of bondage, five types of arising, and five types of existence for both *jñānāvaraṇa* and *antarāya* karma.
- *Sapttatikā Prakaraṇa Ṭīkā*, p. 207
- In the absence of bondage, in *upashāntamoh* and *kṣīṇamoh*, there are five types of arising and five types of existence for both *jñānāvaraṇa* and *antarāya* karma. Subsequently, there is also an absence of arising and existence.

## Clear Karma Text
**257**

**Special Meaning:** These verses indicate the binding, arising, and existence locations of the Darshanavarana karma in relation to the Gunasthanas.

The Darshanavarana karma has different types. The binding of the Satyadhitrik occurs only up to the Sasadan Gunasthana, while the four types like Chakshus Darshanavarana, etc., arise continuously until their destruction, but the five types like Nidra, etc., may or may not arise, and even then, only one arises at a time, not two or more simultaneously. Therefore, in the two Gunasthanas of Mithyatva and Sasadan, there are no 4 types of binding, 4 types of arising, and 6 types of existence, nor 6 types of binding, 5 types of arising, and 9 types of existence. - "**_Micchasane Biie Nav Chav Pan Nav Ya Santasa_**" - In these two Gunasthanas of Mithyatva and Sasadan, there are no 9 types of binding, 4 types of arising, and 9 types of existence.

From the third Misra Gunasthana onwards, up to the first part of the eighth Apurvakarana Gunasthana, there are 6 types of binding, 4 or 5 types of arising, and 9 types of existence - "**_Bhissai Niyattio Chchchau Pan Nab Ya Santakammasa_**". This is because the binding of Satyadhitrik occurs only up to the Sasadan Gunasthana, resulting in 6 types of binding. However, there is no difference in the types of arising and existence. Therefore, in these Gunasthanas, there are 6 types of binding, 4 types of arising, and 9 types of existence.

**_Khinot ti Chari Ukshya Panchasu Giddasu Dosu Nihasu. Ekke Udayam Patte Khinaduchari Moti Panchudaya. || Micchaduvasanto Ti Ya Aniyattio Khaga Pathamamagoti. Pavasatta Vinass Ducharimossi Ya Chchchadduvarime. ||_** - Go. Karmakar 460-452

## Chapter 72

**Seven Types of Bandha**

**Uday** (arising) and **Satta** (existence) are both nine-natured, while **Bandha** (bondage) is six-natured. There are two types of **Bhang** (destruction): one with five-natured **Uday** and nine-natured **Satta**, and another with four-natured **Bandha** and nine-natured **Satta**. 

Although **Styanaddhitrika** (a type of bondage) can arise only until the end of the **Pramattasangat** (a state of mind) **Gunasthan** (stage of spiritual progress), it does not affect the statement of five-natured **Udayasthan** (stage of arising). The difference lies only in the **Prakriti** (nature) of the **Vikalpa** (alternative). 

Up to the sixth **Gunasthan**, the five **Prakriti** (nature) of **Nidra** (sleep), **Prachala** (agitation), etc., are obtained through **Vikala** (disturbance). Beyond that, only **Nidra** and **Prachala** are obtained through **Vikalpa**.

In the first part of the **Apuvarkaran** (a stage of spiritual progress) **Gunasthan**, **Nidra** and **Prabala** (strong) are also destroyed, leaving only four **Prakriti** of **Bandha** in the next three **Gunasthan** up to **Sukshmasampray** (a stage of spiritual progress). However, **Uday** and **Satta** remain as before. Therefore, from the second part of **Apuvarkaran** to **Sukshmasampray** **Gunasthan**, there are two types of **Bhang**: 

* **Four-natured Bandha, four-natured Uday, and nine-natured Satta**
* **Four-natured Bandha, five-natured Uday, and nine-natured Satta**

This is known as "**Chaubandha Tige Chaupana Navans**".

However, this statement should be understood in relation to the **Upshamshreni** (a category of spiritual progress), because it is a rule that **Nidra** or **Prachala** arises only in **Upshamshreni**, not in **Kshapakashreni** (another category of spiritual progress). Therefore, in **Kshapakashreni**, the **Bhang** of five-natured **Uday** does not occur in the three **Gunasthan** of **Apuvarkaran**, etc. After some parts of **Anivrittikaran** (a stage of spiritual progress) have passed, the **Satta** of **Styanaddhitrika** is destroyed, leaving only six **Prakriti** of **Satta**. Therefore, in the last part of **Anivrittikaran** and **Sukshmasampray**, there is one type of **Bhang**:

* **Four-natured Bandha, four-natured Uday, and six-natured Satta**

This is known as "**Dus Juyal Darsanta**". 

Page #297:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karma Granth, 256

In the tenth subtle-stage (**sukshmasampray**), which is the last stage of the **kshapka** series, the **darshanavaran** (veil of perception) is completely destroyed. Therefore, in the subsequent stages, from the eleventh onwards, there is no destruction of the **darshanavaran** in addition to the destruction of **bandha** (bondage).

Therefore, in the **upshantamoha** stage, which is the stage of the **upshama** series, the **udaya** (arising) and **satta** (existence) remain the same as in the tenth stage, but due to the absence of **bandha**, there are two **bhang** (destruction):

* **Uvasante Chaupan Nav** - four **prakriti** (natural elements) of **udaya** and nine **prakriti** of **satta**.
* **Panch Prakriti Udaya** and **Nav Prakriti Satta** - five **prakriti** of **udaya** and nine **prakriti** of **satta**.

In the **kshinamoha** stage, there are **Khinne Urudaya Chhach Chausant** - four **prakriti** of **udaya** and six or four **prakriti** of **satta**. This is because the twelfth stage, **kshinamoha**, belongs to the **kshayaka** series, and in the **apak** series, there is no **udaya** of **nidra** (sleep) or **prachala** (agitation). Therefore, there are four **prakriti** of **udaya** and six or four **prakriti** of **satta**.

Since there is no **udaya** of **nidra** and **prachala** in the **kshinamoha** stage, their **satta** cannot be present at the end of this stage. According to the rule, the **anudaya** (non-arising) **prakriti** are transformed into their corresponding **udaya** **prakriti** through **nisheka** (infusion) and **stibuka** (subtle) **sanक्रमण** (transition). Therefore, at the end of the **kshinamoha** stage, **nidra** and **prachala** will not exist, and only **chakshudarshanavaran** (veil of perception of the eye) and other **dharmas** (qualities) will remain.

This means that in the **kshinamoha** stage, the first **bhang** of four **prakriti** of **udaya** and six **prakriti** of **satta** should be understood until the penultimate moment of the **kshinamoha** stage, and the second **bhang** of four **prakriti** of **udaya** and four **prakriti** of **satta** should be understood at the final moment.

The Chapter of the Seven Tika
The second bhang is obtained. In this way, two bhangs are obtained in the Ksheena-moha Gunasthan as well.
In this way, after explaining the Bandha, Udaya and Satya places in the Gunasthanas of the Uttar Prakritis of Jnana-avaran, Antaray and Darshan-avaran karmas, now the bhangs of Vedaniya, Ayu and Gotra karmas are explained. Beyaniya-uyagoe vibhajj moham par bochch ||41||
Word meaning- Beyaniya-uyagoe- Vedaniya, Ayu and Gotra karmas, vibhajj- dividing, mojh- mohaniya karma, par- after this, bodh- will say.
Gatha- After explaining the bhangs of Vedaniya, Ayu and Gotra karmas, we will explain the bhangs of mohaniya karma.
Viva- The gatha has informed about the division of the bhangs of Vedaniya, Ayu and Gotra karmas, but it has not explained how many bhangs are there. Therefore, the bhang-vikalpas of Vedaniya, Ayu and Gotra karmas, as explained by Acharya Prayalgiri in his tika based on the gatha of the bhashya, are explained here.
The bhangs of Vedaniya and Gotra karmas are indicated in the gatha of the bhashya as follows:
Par ghassu voni satsu ege ghau gugisu shreniyabhang.
Goe pan ghau thi timu emjyu voni ekasmi. ||
That is, there are four bhangs in the sixth Gunasthan of Vedaniya karma, two in the seventh and four in the first, and there is one bhang in the first of Gotra karma, four in the second, two in the third and so on, one in the sixth and so on, and one in the eighth, which is explained below. 

Page #299:
---------------------------
The **Paksha Karma Granth** instructs on the alternatives of Vedaniya Karma in the first verse. From the first Mithyatva Gunasthan to the sixth Pramatta-Samyata Gunasthan, there are six Gunasthanas with "Chau Chassu" - four bhangas. Because, in comparison to Bandha and Uday, Saata and Asata-Vedaniya are two opposing natures. That is, in one time, either one's Bandha or one's Uday occurs, but there is no contradiction in both existing together. And Asata-Vedaniya's Bandha, etc., occurs only in the six Gunasthanas, not beyond. Therefore, in the initial six Gunasthanas, the following four bhangas of Vedaniya Karma are obtained:

1. Asata's Bandha, Asata's Uday, and Saata-Asata's existence.
2. Asata's Bandha, Saata's Uday, and Saata-Asata's existence.
3. Saata's Bandha, Asata's Uday, and Saata-Asata's existence.
4. Saata's Bandha, Saata's Uday, and Saata-Asata's existence.

"Donni Sattasu" - from the seventh Gunasthan to the thirteenth Gunasthan, there are two bhangas in seven Gunasthanas. Because, with the cessation of Asata-Vedaniya's Bandha in the sixth Gunasthan, from the seventh to the thirteenth Gunasthan, only Saata-Vedaniya's Bandha occurs, but both Uday and existence are found. Therefore, in these seven Gunasthanas, the following two bhangas are obtained:

1. Saata's Bandha, Saata's Uday, and Saata-Asata's existence.
2. Saata's Bandha, Asata's Uday, and Saata-Asata's existence.

In this way, up to the thirteenth Gunasthan, the Bandha, etc., of Vedaniya Karma... 

Page #300:
---------------------------
After explaining the alternatives of the Sapttatika Prakarana Sthanas, now we discuss the bhangas of the fourteenth Gunasthan. It is said that 'Ege Chau' - that is, one Gunasthan - the fourteenth Aayogikevali Gunasthan has four bhangas. Because in the Aayogikevali Gunasthan, even the Saata Vedaniya does not bind, therefore, no bhangas are obtained with respect to binding, but they are formed with respect to Uday and Sattaa. Still, in this Gunasthan, for one who has the Uday of Asata, the destruction of the Sattaa of Saata occurs in the Upaantyasamaya, and for one who has the Uday of Saata, the destruction of the Sattaa of Asata occurs in the Upaantyasamaya, therefore, until the Upaantyasamaya, 1. The Uday of Saata and the Kasagi of Saata-Asasa, 2. The Uday of Asata and the Sattaa of Saata-Asata, these two bhangas are obtained. And in the final moment, 3. The Uday of Saata and the Sattaa of Saata, and 4. The Uday of Asata and the Sattaa of Asata, these two bhangas are obtained. In this way, four bhangas of Vedaniya Karma are formed in the Aayogikevali Gunasthan.

Now, we discuss the bhangas of Gotra Karma in the Gunasthanas.

Regarding Gotra Karma, just like Vedaniya Karma, there is a special characteristic that, similar to Saata and Asata Vedaniya, there are opposing natures with respect to the binding and Uday of higher and lower Gotra, in one time period, the binding of one of these two and the Uday of only one can occur, but
1. 'Ekasmin' Aayogikevalini Chatvaro Bhangaa, Se Cheme - Asatasya Udayah:
Saata Saate Sati, Ashava Saatasya Udayah: Saata Saate Sati, Eti, Dvau Vikalava Aayogikevalini Vicharmasamayam Yaavat Praapyete, Gharmasamaye Tu Asatasya Udayah Asatasya Sattaa Yasya Dvidharmasamaye Saatam Ksheenam, Yasya Shvasata Dvicharmasamaye Bheenam Tasyayam Vikalpah - Sasasya Udayah Satasya Sattaa.
-~-Sapttatika Prakarana Teeka, P. 209

---------------------------
The sixth karma granth has two aspects. The first is that the bondage, arising, and existence of the lower gotra occur when the higher gotra of the agnikayik and vayukayik beings are compared. The second is that the bondage, arising, and existence of the lower gotra also occur for some time in those beings who are born from the agnikayik and vayukayik beings. Keeping these two aspects in mind, when we consider the limbs of gotra karma in the mithyatva gunasthan, we get five bhangs - 'goe pan'. These five bhangs are as follows:

1. Bondage of the lower gotra, arising of the lower gotra, and existence of both the lower and higher gotra.
2. Bondage of the lower gotra, arising of the higher or lower gotra, and existence of both the lower and higher gotra.
3. Bondage of the higher gotra, arising of the higher or lower gotra, and existence of both the higher and lower gotra.
4. Bondage of the higher gotra, arising of the lower gotra, and existence of both the higher and lower gotra.
5. Bondage of the lower gotra, arising of the lower gotra, and existence of the lower gotra.

Out of these five bhangs, the fifth bhang - bondage, arising, and existence of the lower gotra - is obtained by the agnikayik and vayukayik beings, and also for some time by those beings who are born from the agnikayik and vayukayik beings. The remaining four options are obtained by the beings in the mithyatva gunasthan.

In the sasadan gunasthan, four bhangs are obtained. Because the bondage of the lower gotra occurs only up to the sasadan gunasthan, and the mixed... - 1 The arising of the lower gotra from another lower gotra, the existence of the lower gotra, this option is obtained by the tejas kayik and vayukayik beings. For some time, it is also obtained by the remaining beings in the amvasas.

**264**

In the *guna sthana* (stages of spiritual progress) of *maptatika* (those who have attained the knowledge of the self), the bondage is of a high *gotra* (spiritual lineage) only. This means that just as in the *shudha sthana* (stage of purity), in the *sarvadan* (stage of complete renunciation) and *muni sthana* (stage of liberation), the bondage of one, the arising of one, and the existence of both become one. According to this, four *bhang* (divisions) are found here, and those four divisions are the same as those mentioned in the *mithyatva* (false belief) *guna sthana* *bhang* 1, 2, 2, and 4.

"**Do Tisu**" - meaning the third, fourth, and fifth *mithyatva*, *avirata samyagdristi* (uninterrupted right faith), and *deshaviriti* (freedom from attachment to the world) *guna sthana* - have two *bhang*. Because from the *gotra* of *go* (animal) up to the *sarvanchava* (all-pervading) *guna sthana*, the bondage is of a high *gotra* only, but both arising and existence are found. Therefore, in these three *guna sthana*, there are two *bhang*: 1. High bondage, high arising, and high-low existence, and 2. Low bondage, low arising, and low-high existence. Here, many *acharyas* (teachers) also agree that in the fifth *guna sthana*, high bondage, high arising, and high-low existence is the only *anga* (part). Regarding this, there is an *agga vachan* (scriptural statement):

"**Sammammenam ayajaiye upchagopaassa ubalo hoi**" - meaning that the arising of a high *gotra* occurs for those beings who are restrained by the common and restrained by the restrained *jati* (birth).

"**Egavasu**" - meaning from the sixth *pramatasanyata* (restrained by delusion) *guna sthana* up to the *mar* (liberated) *guna sthana*, one *bhang* is found in each *guna sthana*. Because from the sixth to the tenth *sukshmasampraaya* (subtle body) *guna sthana*, the bondage is of a high *gotra* only. Therefore, in the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth *pramatasanyata*, *apramatasanyata* (unrestrained by delusion), *apuurvakaran* (unprecedented action), *anivrittibadar* (uninterrupted liberation), and *sukshmasampraaya* *guna sthana*, each has high bondage, high arising, and high...

## From the Karma Granth

**Chapter 265: The Essence of the Lower and Higher Castes**

The essence of the lower and higher castes undergoes a transformation in the tenth **Ganasthana** (stage of spiritual development) when the bond of the higher caste is broken. This transformation continues in the eleventh, twelfth, **Tare-Upashanta-Moha** (stage of subdued delusion), **Kshina-Moha** (stage of diminished delusion), and **Sayogikevali** (stage of liberated being) **Ganasthanas**, where the higher caste emerges and the essence of the higher and lower castes undergoes a transformation. Thus, from the sixth to the thirteenth **Ganasthana**, each **Ganasthana** experiences a transformation. This is proven.

**Two Transformations in the Fourteenth Ganasthana**

In the fourteenth **Ganasthana**, the **Ayogikevali** (stage of liberated being), there are two transformations. This is because the essence of the lower caste exists only until the penultimate moment in the **Ayogikevali Ganasthana**. Since the fourteenth **Ganasthana** does not have the nature of emergence, the essence of the lower caste transforms into the essence of the higher caste through the transition of **Sthibhuk** (the subtle body) in the penultimate moment. Therefore, until the penultimate moment of this **Ganasthana**, the emergence of the higher caste and the essence of the higher and lower castes undergo one transformation. And in the final moment, the emergence of the higher caste and the essence of the higher caste undergo the second transformation. Thus, one should understand that there are two transformations in the fourteenth **Ganasthana**.

**Transformations of Vedaniya and Gotra Karmas**

After discussing the transformations of **Vedaniya** (karmas related to experiences) and **Gotra** (karmas related to caste) in the **Ganasthanas**, we will now discuss the transformations of **Ayukarma** (karmas related to lifespan) based on the **Bhashya** (commentary) verses. The relevant verse is as follows:

**"Achahi Avisa Solas Chisan Cha Bar Gh Doshu. Vo Chausu Titu Ekkam Minchai Su Bauge Bhang."**

This means that in the **Mithyatva** (stage of false belief) **Ganasthana**, there are 28 transformations of **Ayukarma**. In **Sasadan** (stage of attachment), there are 26. In **Mishra** (stage of mixed belief), there are 16. In **Avirat Samyagdristi** (stage of unwavering right faith), there are 20. In **Deshavirat** (stage of detachment from the world), there are 12. In **Pramat** (stage of distraction) and **A-Pramat** (stage of non-distraction), there are 6. In **A-Purvakaran** (stage of non-accumulation of karmas) and other four stages, there are 2. And in **Kshina-Moha** (stage of diminished delusion) and other stages, there is 1. Thus, one should understand the transformations of **Ayukarma** in the **Ganasthanas** from **Mithyatva** to **Kshina-Moha**. The detailed explanation is as follows... 

Page #304:
---------------------------
## The Sapttatika Chapter

**The Mithyatva Gunasthan** has 28 bhangs of Ayukarma. This is because beings in all four gatis are Mithyatva, and there are 5 bhangs for Narakas, 9 for Tiryanchas, 9 for Manusyas, and 5 for Devas. Thus, the 28 bhangs of Ayukarma are mentioned earlier. Therefore, since all these bhangs are possible in the Mithyatva Gunasthan, they are said to be 28 bhangs in the Mithyatva Gunasthan.

**The Sasadan Gunasthan** has 26 bhangs. Since the bondage of Narakayu occurs only in the Mithyatva Gunasthan, Sasadan Samyagdrsti, Tiryanchas, and Manusyas do not bind Narakayu. Therefore, out of the above 28 bhangs, the existence of Bhujyaman Tiryanchayu, Badyaman Narakayu, and Tiryancha Narakayu, and the existence of Bhujyaman Manushayau, Badyaman Narakayu, and Manusya-Narakayu, these two bhangs are reduced, resulting in 26 bhangs in the Sasadan Gunasthan.

**The Third Misra Gunasthan** has a rule that there is no bondage of Ayukarma related to Parbhavatra. Therefore, there is no bondage of any Ayukarma related to Parbhavatra. Therefore, out of the aforementioned 28 bhangs, the two bhangs of Narakas, four bhangs of Tiryanchas, four bhangs of Manusyas, and two bhangs of Devas, obtained during the bondage period, are reduced, resulting in 16 bhangs (2+4+4+2 = 12).

**The Fourth Avirat Samyagdrsti Gunasthan** has 20 bhangs. Because in the Avirat Samyagdrsti Gunasthan, there is no bondage of Narak, Tiryancha, and Manusya Ayukarma for both Tiryanchas and Manusyas, three bhangs are reduced for each. 

**Note:** The footnote mentions that since Tiryanchas and Manusyas do not bind Narakayu while being in the Sasadan state, one bhang is not obtained for each of them during the bondage period of Parmayu, resulting in a total of 26 bhangs. 

Page #305:
---------------------------
The sixth karma granth and the non-binding of the tiyanchayu in both gods and narakas results in one bhang each, making a total of eight bhangs. When these are subtracted from the aforementioned 28 bhangs, 20 bhangs remain.

In the Deshaviraat Gunasthan, there are 12 bhangs. This is because Deshaviraat occurs in both Tiryanch and humans, and if they bind the lifespan related to the Parbhaav, they only bind the Devaaayu, not any other lifespan. Deshaviraat lifespan binders bind only the Devaaayu, not the remaining lifespans. Therefore, there is one bhang each before their lifespan binding and one bhang each during the time of lifespan binding. This makes a total of four bhangs for both Tiryanch and humans combined. Additionally, there are four bhangs for Tiryanch and four bhangs for humans in relation to the aforementioned binding. This is because there is no obstacle in attaining the Deshaviraat Gunasthan for both Tiryanch and humans after binding the lifespan related to all four gatis. Thus, there are four bhangs for Tiryanch and four bhangs for humans in relation to the aforementioned binding, making a total of eight bhangs. Adding these to the aforementioned four bhangs, the total number of bhangs in the Deshaviraat Gunasthan becomes twelve.

'Chh Hosu', meaning the fifth Gunasthan, followed by the Prammatasanyat and Aprammatasanyat Gunasthan, have six bhangs. This is because both these Gunasthan are only for humans and they bind only the Devaaayu. Therefore, there is one bhang before their lifespan binding and one bhang during the time of lifespan binding. However, there are four bhangs in relation to the aforementioned binding because there is no obstacle in attaining the Prammatasanyat and Aprammatasanyat Gunasthan after binding the lifespan related to all four gatis. Thus, combining the one bhang before lifespan binding, one bhang during lifespan binding, and four bhangs in relation to the aforementioned binding, there are six bhangs in both the Prammatasanyat and Aprammatasanyat Gunasthan.

## The Chapter of the Seven Tika

The bondage of Ayukarma (life-span karma) occurs only up to the seventh Gunasthan (stage of spiritual progress). It does not occur in the remaining Gunasthanas, starting from the eighth, A-purvakarana (the stage of purification), and onwards. However, there is a special characteristic: a person who has bound the Devayau (divine life-span) can ascend to the Upshama Shreni (stage of spiritual progress), while one who has bound other Ayus (life-spans) excluding Devayau, does not ascend to the Upshama Shreni.

"Tisu Madagesu Babesu Men Sethi Na Avahan" - A being who has bound three Ayus (excluding Devayau) does not ascend to the Shreni. Therefore, in comparison to Upshama Shreni, two Bhangas (breaks) are obtained in each of the four Gunasthanas: A-purvakarana, Upshantamoha, and the ninth and tenth Gunasthanas, making a total of "Do Chausu" (two fours). These two Bhangas are:

1. The arising of Manushyayu (human life-span) and the existence of Manushyayu.
2. The arising of Manushyayu and the existence of Manushya-Devayau (human-divine life-span).

The first Bhang occurs before the binding period of Ayukarma related to the previous birth, while the second Bhang occurs during the period of cessation of binding.

However, in comparison to the Kshapaka Shreni (stage of spiritual progress), only one Bhang occurs in the three Gunasthanas: A-purvakarana and the following two, which is the arising of Manushyayu and the existence of Manushyayu.

Similarly, in the three Gunasthanas: Kshina Moha (stage of minimal delusion), Sayogikevali (liberated with attachments), and Ayogikevali (liberated without attachments), only one Bhang occurs, which is the arising of Manushyayu and the existence of Manushyayu, making a total of "Tisu Ekk" (three ones).

In this way, the possible Bhangas of Ayukarma in each Gunasthan have been considered, determining the number of Bhangas in each stage.

The description of the six Karmas (actions): Jnana Avarana (knowledge obscuration), Darshan Avarana (perception obscuration), Vedaniya (sensory karma), Ayu (life-span karma), Gotra (family karma), and Antaray (obstacle karma) in the 14 Gunasthanas is as follows:

1. Karma Prakriti Gatha 375.

Now, according to the instructions of the Gatha, we consider the breaking of Mohaniya Karma. Among them, we first explain the breaking of Bandhastanas.

**"In the Gunasthanas, one by one, in the Mohabandhastanas, the bondage is overcome by the five Niyattasthanas."** (42)

## Chapter on the Seven Tika

**Word Meaning:** In the eight **guna sthana** (states of being), there is one **mohaniya karma** (bond of delusion) **bandha sthana** (place of bondage) in each. In the **abhipatta sthana** (state of non-obstruction), there are five, and in the **bandhovarbha** (state beyond bondage), there is no bondage. However, from the **abhipatta sthana** onwards, there is no bondage.

**Meaning:** In the eight **guna sthana** (states of being), from **mithyatva** (false belief) to **apuurvakarana** (state of non-creation), there is one **mohaniya karma** (bond of delusion) **bandha sthana** (place of bondage) in each. In the **abhipatta sthana** (state of non-obstruction), there are five, and in the **bandhovarbha** (state beyond bondage), there is no bondage.

**Specific Meaning:** This verse explains the **bandha sthana** (place of bondage) for **mohaniya karma** (bond of delusion). The general **bandha sthana** for **mohaniya karma** (bond of delusion) have already been explained, which are 22, 21, 17, 13, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 **prakriti** (natural states). These ten places are subtracted from the **guna sthana** (states of being).

"**Guṇasthānage aṭṭasu ekkekkam**" means that from the first **guna sthana** (state of being) of **mithyatva** (false belief) to the eighth **guna sthana** (state of being) of **apuurvakarana** (state of non-creation), there is one **mohaniya karma** (bond of delusion) **bandha sthana** (place of bondage) in each **guna sthana** (state of being). It should be understood that in the **mithyatva** (false belief) **guna sthana** (state of being), there is one **bandha sthana** (place of bondage) of 22 **prakriti** (natural states), in the **sāsādana** (state of self-control) **guna sthana** (state of being), there is one **bandha sthana** (place of bondage) of 21 **prakriti** (natural states), in the **miśra** (mixed) **guna sthana** (state of being) and the **avirata samyagdṛṣṭi** (unwavering right faith) **guna sthana** (state of being), there is one **bandha sthana** (place of bondage) of 17 **prakriti** (natural states), in **deśaviraṭi** (state of detachment from the world), there is one **bandha sthana** (place of bondage) of 13 **prakriti** (natural states), and in **pramattasamyata** (state of controlled mind), **apramattasamyata** (state of uncontrolled mind), and **apuurvakarana** (state of non-creation), there is one **bandha sthana** (place of bondage) of 2 **prakriti** (natural states). The details of their breaking should be understood as explained in the chapter on **mohaniya karma** (bond of delusion) **bandha sthana** (place of bondage). However, here is a special point: the breaking of **arati** (distress) and **śoka** (sorrow) happens in the **pramattasamyata** (state of controlled mind) **guna sthana** (state of being). Therefore, in the **apramattasamyata** (state of uncontrolled mind) and **apuurvakarana** (state of non-creation) **guna sthana** (state of being), only one breaking is obtained in each of the nine **prakriti** (natural states) **bandha sthana** (place of bondage). The previous nine **prakriti** (natural states) ...

##  The Post Karma Granth

**271** Two **bhang** are mentioned in the **bandha sthana**. These are said in relation to the **pramatta** and **samyata** **guna sthana**.

**Panchaniyattithana** - In the ninth **guna sthana**, called **anivrittibada**, there are five **bandha sthana**: 5, 4, 3, 2, and **prakritik**. This is because the ninth **guna sthana** has five parts, and in each part, there is a **bandha vicched** of one **mohaniya karma** **prakritik**. Therefore, in the first part, there are 5 **bandha sthana**, in the second part, 4, in the third part, 3, in the fourth part, 2, and in the fifth part, 1 **prakritik bandha sthana**. After this, in the **sukshama sampraaya** and subsequent **guna sthana**, there is no **bandha**, so **bandha sthana** is prohibited.

The essence of the above statement is that in the first eight **guna sthana**, there is one **bandha sthana** in each. In the ninth **guna sthana**, there are five **bandha sthana**, and after that, in the tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth **guna sthana**, there is no **bandha** of **mohaniya karma**, so there is no **bandha sthana**.

After describing the **bandha sthana** of **mohaniya karma** in the **guna sthana**, we now describe the **udaya sthana** in the next three verses.

... ... 1. **Kevalam pramatta purvakaran yo bhang ekak eva vaktavya, atishokayobanyasya pramatta guna sthana ke eva vyachchedat. Prak cha pramatta apekshya navaka bandha sthane dro bhago dasito.**

Sixth Karma Granth
273 Patharth - In the Mithyatva Gunasthan, from the seventh to the tenth excellent nature, in Sasadan and Mishtra, from the seventh to the ninth, in Avirat Samyagdristi Gunasthan, from the sixth to the ninth, in Deshavirat, from the fifth to the eighth, and in the Prammat and Aprammat Samyat Gunasthan, from the fourth to the seventh, in Apurvakaran, from the fourth to the sixth, and in the Anivriti Ghadar Gunasthan, there are one or two Udayasthan Mohaniyakam.
The one with the Sukshmasampray Gunasthan experiences one nature, and the rest with the subsequent Gunasthan are Avedak. The proof of their bhangas should be known as mentioned earlier. Special Note - In these three verses, the Udayasthan in the Gunasthan of Mohaniyakarma are mentioned, indicating how many natures, at most and at least, arise together in which Gunasthan. There are a total of 28 Uttar Prakritis of Mohaniyakarma. Out of them, a maximum of ten natures and a minimum of one nature arise together in one time period. Thus, there should be ten Udayasthan from one to ten, but the rise of three Prakritis is not found anywhere because when either of the two pairs of Hasya-Rati or Arati-Shok is combined in the two Prakriti Udayasthan, only four Prakriti Udayasthan are obtained. Therefore, instead of mentioning three Prakriti Udayasthan, the remaining nine Udayasthan of 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 Prakritis are mentioned for Mohaniyakarma.

---------------------------
## Chapter 274: The Sevenfold

Although the general discussion of the sources of mohaniya karma has been explained in detail in verse 11, we will discuss it here according to the verses, in relation to the gunasthana.

**'Sanad Daman Minte'** - In the first gunasthana, Misyaishti, there are four natural sources: 7, 8, 6, and 10. The seven natural sources arise from the firm emergence of these seven natures: Mithyatva, Apraatyakhyanavaran, Pratyakhyanavaran, Sanjwalan, any one of the three from Krodhadi, any one of the three Vedas, and any one of the two pairs, Hasya-Rati and Shoka-Rati. 

When fear, disgust, or any one of the four Anantanubandhi kshayas is added to these seven natures, it becomes eight natural sources. When any two of fear, disgust, or fear and Anantanubandhi, or disgust and Anantanubandhi are added to these seven natures, it becomes nine natural sources. When fear, disgust, and any one of the Anantanubandhi kshayas are added together to these seven natures, it becomes ten natural sources.

In these four sources, there are eight combinations: one with seven, three with eight, three with nine, and one with ten. Thus, there are eight sets of 24 bhangas.

In the Sasadan and Mishra gunasthana, there are three sources each: seven, eight, and nine natural sources.

In the Sasadan gunasthana, the seven natural sources arise from the firm emergence of these seven natures: Anantanubandhi, Apraatyakhyanavaran, Pratyakhyanavaran, Sanjwalan, any one of the four from Krodhadi, any one of the three Vedas, and any one of the two pairs. 

When fear or disgust is added to this, it becomes eight natural sources. When both fear and disgust are added together, it becomes nine natural sources. 

Page #313:
---------------------------
The sixth karma granth is called "Mishra Gunasthan". It has 24 bhangas. These bhangas are divided into three groups: one group of seven, two groups of eight, and one group of nine.

In Mishra Gunasthan, the seven-natured udaysthan is obtained due to the regular arising of seven natures: three of the three kshayas (excluding anantanubandhi), one of the three vedas, one of the two yugals, and the mixed mohaniya. This udaysthan has one group of 24 bhangas.

The eight-natured udaysthan is obtained when fear is added to the seven natures. This udaysthan has two groups of 24 bhangas.

The nine-natured udaysthan is obtained when fear and disgust are combined with the seven natures. This udaysthan has one group of 24 bhangas.

Therefore, in Mishra Gunasthan, there are 7, 8, and 9-natured udaysthans, with a total of four groups of 24 bhangas.

In the Avirat Samyagdristi Gunasthan, there are four udaysthans from six to nine natures: "Chhai Nav U AvirAe". This means there are six-natured, seven-natured, eight-natured, and nine-natured udaysthans.

The six-natured udaysthan arises from the six natures: three of the three kshayas, one of the three vedas, and one of the two yugals. This udaysthan has one group of 24 bhangas.

The seven-natured udaysthan is obtained when fear, disgust, or vedak samyaktva is added to the six natures. This udaysthan has three groups of 24 bhangas due to the three alternative combinations.

The eight-natured udaysthan is obtained when two natures are combined in sequence: fear and disgust, fear and vedak samyaktva, or disgust and vedak samyaktva. This udaysthan has three groups of 24 bhangas due to the three alternative combinations. 

Page #314:
---------------------------
## Chapter Six of the Sapttatika: The Sixfold Nature of the Udyaasthan

In the sixth nature of the Udyaasthan, fear, disgust, or Vedak Samyaktva are added to the five natures, resulting in a total of six natures. This leads to three possibilities, resulting in three sets of 24 Bhangas.

In the seventh nature of the Udyaasthan, fear, disgust, or fear and Vedak Samyaktva, or disgust and Vedak Samyaktva are added to the five natures. This also leads to three possibilities, resulting in three sets of 24 Bhangas.

In the eighth nature of the Udyaasthan, fear, disgust, and Vedak Samyaktva are added to the five natures. This results in only one possibility, leading to one set of 24 Bhangas.

In total, there are eight sets of 24 Bhangas in the fourth Gunasthan.

The fifth Gunasthan, Desavirat, has four Udyaasthan, from the fifth to the eighth nature.

The fifth Udyaasthan consists of five natures: Pratyakhyana Avarana, two of the three passions (anger, pride, deceit), one of the three Vedas, and one of the two pairs. This results in one set of 24 Bhangas.

The sixth Udyaasthan is formed by adding fear, disgust, or Vedak Samyaktva to the five natures of the fifth Udyaasthan.

The seventh Udyaasthan is formed by adding fear, disgust, or fear and Vedak Samyaktva, or disgust and Vedak Samyaktva to the five natures of the fifth Udyaasthan.

The eighth Udyaasthan is formed by adding fear, disgust, and Vedak Samyaktva to the five natures of the fifth Udyaasthan.

The term "Virae Khaovsamie" in the verse refers to the sixth and seventh Gunasthan, which are known as Kshayopa-shamic Virat. This term is specific to these two Gunasthan.

The subsequent Gunasthan are referred to as either Upshamik or Kshapak. Those who ascend the Upshamik श्रेणी are called Upshamik, and those who ascend the Kshapak श्रेणी are called Kshapak.

## Sixth Karma-nagyi

**277**

The verse instructs on the **udayasthanas** (arising places) in the two **gunasthanas** (states of qualities) of **pramatta** (distracted) and **aprammatta** (undistracted) **virata** (freed from attachment) - "**Chauraai Satt**" (four to seven). This means that the **udayasthanas** from the fourth to the seventh **prakriti** (nature) - four, five, six, and seven **prakritis**.

For both these **gunasthanavi** (belonging to the **gunasthanas**) beings, the **sanjwalan** (agitation) **chatuṣka** (fourfold) consists of one of the four **kṣayās** (passions) like anger, one of the three **vedas** (knowledge), and one of the two **yugalas** (pairs). This constitutes the four **prakriti** **udayastana**. Here, there are twenty-four **bhanga** (breaks).

When one of the **bhanga** like **bhaya** (fear), **jugupsa** (aversion), or **vedaka samyaktv** (right knowledge) is added to the four **prakritis**, it becomes the five **prakriti** **udayastana**. There are three **vikalpa prakritis** (alternative natures), so there are three sets of twenty-four **bhanga** here.

When **bhaya**, **jugupsa**, or **bhaya**, **vedaka samyaktv**, or **jugupsa**, **vedaka samyaktv** are combined with the four **prakritis**, it becomes the six **prakriti** **udayastana**. Here too, there are three sets of twenty-four **bhanga**.

When **bhaya**, **jugupsa**, and **vedaka samyaktv** are combined with the four **prakriti** **udayastana**, it becomes the seven **prakriti** **udayastana**. Since there are no **vikalpa prakritis** here, there is only one set of twenty-four **bhanga**.

In total, there are eight sets of twenty-four **bhanga** each in the sixth and seventh **gunasthanas**.

**In the eighth **apuurvakarana** (non-retrogression) **gunastana**, there are three **udayasthanas** - four, five, and six **prakritis**.

When one of the **kṣayās** from the **sanjwalan** **kṣaya** **chatuṣka**, one of the three **vedas**, and one of the two **yugalas** are combined, it becomes the four **prakriti** **udayastana** and there is one set of twenty-four **bhanga**.

When one of **bhaya** or **jugupsa** is added to the four **prakritis**, it becomes the five **prakriti** **udayastana**. Since there are two **vikalpa prakritis** here, there are two sets of twenty-four **bhanga**.

When **bhaya** and **jugupsa** are combined with the four **prakritis**, it becomes the six **prakriti**... 

Page #316:
---------------------------
## Chapter on Sapta-tika

One should know the **udayasthan** (arising place) and there are twenty-four **bhangas** (breakings). In this way, in the eighth **gunasthan** (stage of merit), there are four sets of twenty-four **bhangas**.

**278**

**7**

"**Anivritibare purna ikko va duve va**" - meaning, in the ninth **anivrittikadar gunasthan**, there are two **prakritik** (natural) and one **prakritik**. Here, in the **udayasthan** of two **prakritik**, there is the arising of one **kashaya** (passion) from the four **kashaya** and one **veda** (knowledge) from the three **vedas**. Here, multiplying the four **kashaya** by the three **vedas**, we get twelve **bhangas**. After the **veda** is broken, there is one **prakritik** **udayasthan**, which occurs at the time of four, three, two, and one **prakritik** **bandha** (bond). That is, one should understand that there are two **prakritik** **udayasthan** until the **sveda** (knowledge) part and one **prakritik** in the **aved** (ignorance) part. Although ten **bhangas** are mentioned, with four **prakritik** **bandha** in one **prakritik** **udayasthan**, three **prakritik** **bandha** in three, two **prakritik** **bandha** in two, and one **prakritik** **bandha** in one, here, instead of considering the difference in **bandhastan** (place of bond), four **bhangas** are intended in general.

In the tenth **sukshmasampray gunasthan**, there is one **bhang** due to the arising of one subtle **lobha** (greed) - "**Egan suhumararaago veei**". In this way, one should know that there are a total of five **bhangas** in one **prakritik** **udayasthan**.

After the tenth **gunasthan**, in the subsequent **gunasthan** like **upshantamoha** etc., there is no arising of **mohaniyakarma** (karma that binds to the mind), so there is not even one **bhang** in those **gunasthan** in relation to **uday** (arising).

In this way, according to the instructions of the verses, the **udayasthan** of **mohaniyakarma** in the **gunasthan** and their **bhangas** have been stated, and at the end of the verse, the evidence of the **bhangas** is to be known from the previously mentioned...

## Sixty Karmas Text
## 276

The indication given here means that just as the destruction of the arising places of the Mohaniya Karma was explained earlier while discussing the general arising places, the same should be understood here as well. For clarity, the destruction of the arising places is indicated here again. But this indication should not be understood as different from the previous one.

Now, with respect to the Mithyatva-drishti and other Gunasthanas, the number of destructions of the arising places from ten to one is explained:

**Ekk chhadekkarekarasev ekkarsev nav tinni. Aa charbees gaya bar duge panch ekkammi ||46||**

**Word Meaning:**

* **Ekk** - One
* **Chhadekkarekarasev** - Six, eleven
* **Ekkarsev** - Eleven
* **Nav** - Nine
* **Tinni** - Three
* **Aa** - This
* **Charbees gaya** - Twenty-four
* **Bar** - Twelve
* **Duge** - In the arising of two
* **Panch** - Five
* **Ekkammi** - In the arising of one

**Meaning of the Verse:**

Except for the arising places of two and one, there are one, six, eleven, eleven, nine, and three twenty-fours of destruction in the arising places of ten and so on. And there are twelve destructions in the arising of two and five destructions in the arising of one.

**Special Meaning:**

The nine arising places of Mohaniya Karma have been explained earlier. In this verse, instead of mentioning the arising place of the natural number, the number of destructions of that place is mentioned. It should be understood in this order:

* In the tenth natural arising place, there are twenty-four destructions.
* In the ninth natural arising place, there are six twenty-fours of destructions.
* In the eighth natural arising place, there are eleven twenty-fours of destructions.
* In the seventh natural arising place, there are eleven twenty-fours of destructions.
* In the sixth natural arising place, there are eleven twenty-fours of destructions.

## Chapter 280: 

There are 9 *Chaubisi* (sets of 24) in the five-natured *Udayasthan* (state of arising), 3 *Chaubisi* in the four-natured *Udayasthan*, 12 *Bhang* (divisions) in the two-natured *Udayasthan*, and 5 *Bhang* in the one-natured *Udayasthan*. Their detailed explanation is given below.

The ten-natured *Udayasthan* is one, hence it has one *Chaubisi* of *Bhang*. This *Udayasthan* is found in the *Mithyatva* (false belief) *Gunasthan* (state of qualities).

The nine-natured *Udayasthan* has six *Chaubisi* of *Bhang* because this *Udayasthan* is found in the *Mithyatva*, *Sasadan*, *Mishra*, and *Avirat Samyagdristi* *Gunasthan* (states of qualities). In the *Priyatva* *Gunasthan*, there are three *Prakriti Vikalp* (nature variations), hence it has three *Chaubisi* of *Bhang*. In the remaining three *Gunasthan*, there is no *Prakriti Vikalp*, hence each has one *Chaubisi* of *Bhang*.

The eight-natured *Udayasthan* has eleven *Chaubisi* of *Bhang*. This eight-natured *Udayasthan* exists from the first to the fifth *Gunasthan* and is formed by three variations of *Prakriti* in *Mithyatva* and *Avirat Samyagdristi* *Gunasthan*, two variations in *Sasadan* and *Mishra*, and no variation in *Deshavirat* *Gunasthan*. Therefore, there are three *Chaubisi* of *Bhang* in *Mithyatva* and *Avirat*, two in *Sasadan* and *Mishra*, and one in *Deshavirat*. The total is 3+3+2+2+1=11.

Similarly, the seven-natured *Udayasthan* also has eleven *Chaubisi* of *Bhang*. This *Udayasthan* is found from the first to the seventh *Gunasthan*. In the fourth and fifth *Gunasthan*, there are three variations of *Prakriti*, hence it is formed in three ways. Therefore, each of these two *Gunasthan* has three *Chaubisi* of *Bhang*. In the remaining five *Gunasthan* (first, second, third, sixth, and seventh), there is no *Prakriti Vikalp*, hence each has one *Chaubisi* of *Bhang*. The total is eleven.

##  The Eleven Twenty-Fours of the Six Natural Arising Places

The eleven twenty-fours of the six natural arising places are as follows: one each in the uninterrupted right faith and the non-return, and three each in the worldly-unbound, the heedless unbound, and the heedful unbound, totaling eleven.

## The Nine Twenty-Fours of the Five Natural Arising Places

There are nine twenty-fours in the five natural arising places. Of these, one is in the worldly-unbound, three each in the heedless and heedful unbound qualities, and two in the non-return.

## The Three Twenty-Fours of the Four Natural Arising Places

In the four natural arising places, there is one twenty-four each in the heedless unbound, the heedful unbound, and the non-return qualities, totaling three twenty-fours.

## The Purity of the Twenty-Fours

All these have purity, and there are twelve in the two natural arising places and five in the one natural arising place - "Twelve are the obstacles, five are the single" - the explanation of which has been given in the context of the previous verse.

## The Total Number of Twenty-Fours and Obstacles

Thus, from ten to one natural arising places, a total of 52 twenty-fours and 17 obstacles are obtained. Their discussion in relation to the qualities is as follows in the inner commentary verse:

"Eight, four, four, eight, eight, eight, eight, and four twenty-fours are there, and twelve obstacles and five are in the non-return."

## The Number of Arising Choices

From the wrong view to the non-return, there are eight, four, four, eight, eight, eight, eight, and four twenty-fours in the eight qualities, and twelve obstacles and five in the non-return quality.

Thus, with the obtaining of the obstacles, there are a total of 1265 arising choices. They should be understood as follows: the total number of 52 twenty-fours is 5248 (52 x 24 = 1248), and adding the 17 obstacles of the non-return quality to this, the number becomes 1248 + 17 = 1265. And all the steps from ten to four natural arising places are 352, so multiplying them by 24 gives 8448.

On the other hand,
283 After stating the arising places of the mohaniya karma and their destructions in relation to the guna sthana, now in the next verse, we point out the destructions in relation to yoga, upayoga, and leshya etc.

## Chapter 284: The Seven Tika

**Regarding the number of Udayavikalpas and Padavrindas in relation to Yoga, Upayoga, and Leshya in the Gunasthanas:**

A general rule is that the number of Udayavikalpas and Padavrindas in each Gunasthana is obtained by multiplying the number of Yoga, Upayoga, and Leshya in that Gunasthana. Therefore, it is essential to know the number of Yoga, Upayoga, and Leshya in each Gunasthana. However, it is impossible to state them all at once, so we will consider them sequentially in relation to Yoga, Upayoga, and Leshya.

**Regarding the Bhangas in relation to Yoga:**

In the Mithyatva Gunasthana, there are 13 Yogas and 8 Chaubisi of Bhangas. Out of these, there are 8 Chaubisi of Bhangas in each of the four Manoyoga, four Vachanayoga, Audarik Kayayoga, and Vaikriya Kayayoga, totaling 80 Chaubisi (10 x 8). However, in the three Yogas - Audarik Mishra Kayayoga, Vaiyamishra Kayayoga, and Karman Kayayoga - there are four Chaubisi each, including the Uday of Anantanubandhi. This is because when the Anantanubandhi Chatushk is disjoined, the Jiva goes to the Mithyatva Gunasthana, and death does not occur until the Uday of Anantanubandhi. Therefore, in these three Yogas, four Chaubisi without the Uday of Anantanubandhi are not possible.

**Specific Explanation:**

A Jiva who has disjoined the Anantanubandhi, upon attaining Mithyatva, experiences the Uday of Anantanubandhi after one Avli Kala. Such a Jiva dies only when the Uday of Anantanubandhi occurs, not before. Therefore, the four Chaubisi without the Uday of Anantanubandhi are not found in these three Yogas. 

Page #323:
---------------------------
## Text on Karma Granth

**285** Therefore, in these three yogas, there are a total of twelve Chaubisi of bhangas. Adding these to the previously mentioned 80 Chaubisi (80+12-12), the total becomes 62 Chaubisi. Multiplying this by 54, the total becomes 2208.

In the second Sasadan Gunasthan, there are 13 yogas, and each yoga has four Chaubisi, making a total of 52 Chaubisi of bhangas. However, in Sasadan Gunasthan, Napunsakaved does not arise. Therefore, there are 48 Chaubisi for twelve yogas, and four Shodashak for Vaikriyamishra Kayayoga. Multiplying 48 by 24, we get 1152 bhangas. Adding 64 bhangas of four Shodashak to this number, the total bhangas in Sasadan Gunasthan become 1216.

In Samyagmithyadristi Gunasthan, there are four Manoyoga, four Vachanayoga, and two Kayayoga (Audarik and Vaikriya), making a total of ten yogas. Each yoga has four Chaubisi of bhangas. Therefore, multiplying 10 by four Chaubisi, we get 2444 = 66410 = 660 total bhangas.

In Avirat Samyagdristi Gunasthan, there should be 13 yogas, and each yoga should have eight Chaubisi of bhangas. However, there is a rule that in the fourth Gunasthan, Vaikriyamishra Kayayoga and Karman Kayayoga do not have Strived. This is because Avirat Samyagdristi Jiva does not get reborn in Strivedis after death. Therefore, instead of eight Chaubisi of bhangas in these two yogas, eight Shodashak are obtained. Explaining this reason, Acharya Malayagiri said: "Strivedi Samyaishti Jiva is not Vaikriyamishra Kayayogi or Karman Kayayogi." This statement is made from the perspective of abundance. Perhaps, even in these...

## Chapter 72

The production of Right-Faithful souls is seen with female-bodied beings. This is also clarified in the Bruṇi.

**Oh, Hariyavi!**

That is to say, perhaps a Right-Faithful soul is born even among female-bodied beings. And in the fourth Gunasthāna, the Audārika-miśra Kāyayoga, there is no female-bodied or neuter-bodied being. Because female-bodied and neuter-bodied beings do not continuously produce Right-Faithful souls among the animals and humans, therefore, in the Audārika-miśra Kāyayoga, they do not obtain the twenty-four Bhanga, but obtain eight Ashṭaka. A female-bodied or neuter-bodied Right-Faithful soul is not an Audārika-miśra Kāyayogi. This should be understood from the perspective of abundance.

Thus, in the Avirata Samyagdṛṣṭi Gunasthāna, there are eighty twenty-fours of ten Yogas, the Vaikriya-miśra Kāyayoga and the Kārmeṇa Kāyayoga, each having eight sixteen-fold divisions, and the Audārika-miśra Kāyayoga having eight Ashṭaka. Their Bhanga are 80 x 24 = 1620 and 16 x 8 = 128, again 16 x 8 = 128 and 8 x 8 = 64. Their total sum is...

1 (a) These Avirata Samyagdṛṣṭi and Kriya-miśra Kārmeṇa Kāyayoga, each having eight Ashṭaka, in these Udayasthāna Vikalpa, the female-bodied being is not found. In the Vaikriya Kāyayogi, among the female-bodied beings, there is no production of Avirata Samyagdṛṣṭi. This is said based on the prevalence, otherwise, perhaps, even among the female-bodied beings, there is such a birth. - Sapttatika Prakaraṇa Tīkā, p. 217

(b) In the Digambara tradition, there is only one opinion that a Right-Faithful soul does not arise after death among female-bodied beings.

2 In the Avirata Samyagdṛṣṭi, the Audārika-miśra Kāyayoga, these eight-fold Udayasthāna Vikalpa are obtained with the Vedas, not with the female-bodied or neuter-bodied Vedas. Among the animals and humans, there is no production of Avirata Samyagdṛṣṭi among the female-bodied and neuter-bodied beings. This is said based on the abundance. - Sapttatika Prakaraṇa Tīkā, p. 217

### 287

1120 + 128 + 128 = 642240.  Compared to Shri G, 2240 bhang are attained in the fourth Avirat Samyagdrishti Gunasthan.

In the fifth Deshaviriti Gunasthan, there are 11 yogas without Audarik Mishra, Karman Kayayog, and Aharakdvik. Here, there are 24 possibilities of bhang in each yoga, so the total bhang here is (114888 x 242112) 2112.

In the sixth Pramattasanyat Gunasthan, there are 13 yogas without Audarik Mishra and Karman Kayayog, and there should be 24 possibilities of bhang in each yoga. However, there is a rule that Aharak Kayayog and Aharakmitra Kayayog do not occur in Strived. This is because Aharak Samudghāt is only performed by the fourteen Purvadhari. However, the knowledge of the fourteen Purvo of women is not found. Explaining the reason for this, it is also said that:

"**Tuchcha Garavbahula Chalidia Bukla V Ghiiye. Iy Bhaise Samapana Bhumaashaao Y No Yogam.**"

Meaning, Strivedi Jivas are insignificant, full of gravity, have fickle senses and weak intellect. Therefore, they are not capable of much study and they do not have knowledge of the Drishtivad Anga.

Therefore, in eleven yogas, there are eight sets of 24 bhang, but in Aharak and Aharak Mishra Kayayog, there are eight sets of 16 bhang. Thus, here there are 11 x 6424 = 2112 and 1648 x 126 and 1648 = 128 bhang. The sum of all these is 2112 + 128128 = 2368. Therefore, the total bhang in Pramattasanyat Gunasthan is 2368.

## The Chapter of the Seventieth

A being who attains the **Vairyaka Kayayoga** and **Aharaka Kayayoga** in the **Pramatta-Samyata Gunasthan** becomes **A-Pramatta-Samyata**. While in this **A-Pramatta-Samyata** state, these two yogas remain. Such an **A-Pramatta-Samyata** being does not initiate **Vairyaka** and **Aharaka** **Samudghata**, therefore, **Vairyaka-Mishra Kayayoga** and **Aharaka-Mishra Kayayoga** are not considered in this **Gunasthan**. Due to this, in the seventh **A-Pramatta-Samyata Gunasthan**, there are eleven yogas: four **Manoyoga**, four **Vachanayoga**, and **Audarika**, **Vairyaka**, and **Aharaka Kayayoga**.

These yogas should have 24 **Bhangas** each, totaling 84 **Bhangas**. However, since **Aharaka Kayayoga** does not have **Striveda**, there are 24 **Bhangas** in ten yogas and 16 **Bhangas** in **Aharaka Kayayoga**. The total number of **Bhangas** is 2048, which is more than the yogas in the **A-Pramatta-Samyata Gunasthan**.

In the eighth **A-Purva-Karana Gunasthan**, there are nine yogas, each with 24 **Bhangas**. Therefore, there are a total of 864 **Bhangas** here. In the ninth **Anivriti-Vadara Gunasthan**, there is one yoga and 16 **Bhangas**. Multiplying 16 by 6, we get a total of 144 **Bhangas**. In the tenth **Sukshma-Samparaya Gunasthan**, there is one yoga and one **Bhang**. Therefore, there are a total of 6 **Bhangas** here.

Adding the total **Bhangas** of these ten **Gunasthanas**, we get 2208 + 1216 + 660 + 2240 + 2112 + 2366 + 2046 + 664 + 144 + 6 = 14169. It is also said:

"**Chataks Ya Sahasra Samyam Va Gunahitaram Udayamanam**"

This means that the total number of **Udaya-Vikalpas** of **Mohaniya Karma** is 14166, which is more than the yogas.

The chapter on Sapta-tika discusses the number of Udayavikalpas in the Gunasthanas, and then proceeds to consider the number of Padavrindas. The following verse from the Annabhashya is quoted:

"Atthi pati-san batti-san sastu-meva bavan-na.
Choyalan dhoya bhisha vi me misch-ma-isu."

This means that there are 68, 32, 32, 60, 52, 14, 44, and 20 Udayapadas in the Gunasthanas of Mithya-ishti, etc.

Here, Udayapada refers to the nature of the Udayasthanas. For example, in the Mithyatva Gunasthana, there are four Udayasthanas: 10, 6, 8, and 7 Prakrutis. The Udayasthana with 10 Prakrutis is one, so it has ten Prakrutis. The Udayasthana with 6 Prakrutis is formed by three alternative Prakrutis, so it has three, resulting in 27 Prakrutis. Similarly, the Udayasthana with 8 Prakrutis has 24 Prakrutis, and the one with 7 Prakrutis has 7. Thus, the Mithyatva Gunasthana has a total of 10 + 27 + 24 + 7 = 68 Prakrutis. The 32, etc., Udayapadas mentioned for the other Gunasthanas like Sasadan, etc., should be understood in the same way.

If we add all the Udayapadas of these eight Gunasthanas (from 68 to 27), the total number is 352. However, each Udayapada has 24 Bhangas. Therefore, multiplying 352 by 24 gives us 8448. These Padavrindas should be known up to the A-purvakarana Gunasthana. Adding the 28 Bhangas of the Anivrittikarana Gunasthana and the 1 Bhangas of the Sushama-Samparaya Gunasthana, we get 8448 + 29 = 8477. These are the total number of Padavrindas from the Mithyatva Gunasthana to the Sukshma-Samparaya Gunasthana.

### 261

Now, if we want to bring the number of पदवृन्द in the ten गुणस्थान in relation to the Yogas, we need to pay attention to two things: 1. How many पदवृन्द and Yogas are there in each गुणस्थान, and 2. How many पदवृन्द are possible in each Yoga. Keeping these two things in mind, we will now explain the पदवृन्द of the गुणस्थान in relation to the Yogas.

It has been clarified earlier that there are 4 उदयस्थान in the मिथ्यात्व गुणस्थान, and their total पद are 68. Out of these, one सात प्रकृतिक उदयस्थान, two आठ प्रकृतिक उदयस्थान, and one नौ प्रकृतिक उदयस्थान are devoid of the उदय of अनन्तानुबंधी, whose total उदयपद are 32. And one आठ प्रकृतिक उदयस्थान, two नौ प्रकृतिक उदयस्थान, and one दस प्रकृतिक उदयस्थान, these four उदयस्थान are with the उदय of अनन्तानुबंधी, whose total उदयपद are 36. Out of these, the first 32 उदयपद are found with these ten Yogas: 4 मनोयोग, 4 वचनयोग, औदारिक काययोग, and वैकिय काययोग. Since other Yogas are not possible here, multiplying these 32 by 10 gives us 320. And the 36 उदयपद are found with the aforementioned ten Yogas, and also with औदारिकमिश्र, वैक्रियमिश्र, and कार्मणयोग, these 13 Yogas. Since these पद are possible in both पर्याप्त and अपर्याप्त states, multiplying 36 by 13 gives us 468.

1. The method to obtain the total पदवृन्द of the मिथ्यात्व गुणस्थान is to add 320 and 468 and then multiply them by 24. This gives us the total पदवृन्द of the मिथ्यात्व गुणस्थान, which is 320 + 468 = 788 X 24 = 18612.

In the सासादन गुणस्थान, there are 13 Yogas and 32 उदयपद. All these उदयपद are possible in 12 Yogas, but in the सासादन सम्यग्दृष्टि, the उदय of नपुंसकवेद does not occur in क्रियमिश्र. Therefore, here, नपुंसकवेद... 

Page #330:
---------------------------
## Chapter 262: Saptaatika

**It is necessary to reduce the number of bhangas.** This means that instead of multiplying 13 yogas by 32, we should multiply 12 by 32 and then by 24. And instead of multiplying 32 by 16 for Vaikriyamishra, we should multiply 32 by 16. In this way, we get 12432 = 354424, 6216, and for Naikiyamishra, 32416 = 512. The total of these two, 6216 and 512, is 1728. These 1728 are the padavrindas in the Sasadan Gunasthan.

In the Mith Gunasthan, there are 10 yogas and 32 udayapadas. Here, all the udayapadas and their bhangas are possible in all the yogas. Therefore, multiplying 10 by 32 and then by 24, we get 7680 padavrindas (324108 - 320 x 24 = 7680).

In the Avirat Samyagdristi Gunasthan, there are 13 yogas and 60 udayapadas. Here, all the udayapadas and their bhangas are possible in 10 yogas. Therefore, multiplying 10 by 60 and then by 24, we get 14400 bhangas related to 10 yogas. However, in Vaikriyamishra Kayayoga and Karman Kayayoga, Strived does not arise, so the bhangas related to Strived are not obtained. Therefore, multiplying 2 by 60 and then by 16, we get 1920 bhangas related to these two yogas. And in Audarikamishra Kayayoga, Strived and Napumsakaved do not arise, so the bhangas related to these two yogas are not obtained. Therefore, multiplying 60 by 8, we get 480 bhangas related to Audarikamishra Kayayoga. In this way, in the fourth Avirat Samyagdristi Gunasthan, there are 14400 + 1620 + 480 = 16800 padavrindas related to 13 yogas.

In the Deshavirat Gunasthan, there are 11 yogas and 52 udayapadas. Here, all the udayapadas and their bhangas are possible in all the yogas. Therefore, multiplying 11 by 52 and then by 24, we get 13728 bhangas.

## Lost Firm Granth

**263** In the **Pramatta Samyata Gunasthan**, there are 13 **Yogas** and 44 **Padas**, but the **Strived** does not arise in the **Aharak Dwik**. Therefore, considering 11 **Yogas**, multiply 11 by 44 and then by 24, which gives 11444 x 24 = 484424 = 11616. And considering the **Aharak Dwik**, multiply 44 by 2 and then by 16, which gives 2444 = 88416 - 1408. Then, adding 11616 + 1408, we get a total of 13024 **Padavrund** in the **Pramatta Samyata Gunasthan**.

In the **Aparamatta Samyata Gunasthan**, there are also 11 **Yogas** and 44 **Padas**, but the **Strived** does not arise in the **Aharak Kayayog**. Therefore, considering 10 **Yogas**, multiply 10 by 44 and then by 24. And considering the **Aharak Kayayog**, multiply 44 by 16. Doing this, we get a total of 11264 **Padavrund** in the **Aparamatta Samyata Gunasthan**.

In the **Apuurvakaran**, there are 20 **Yogas** and **Padas**. Multiplying 20 by itself and then by 24, we get a total of 4320 **Padavrund** here.

In the **Anivritibadar Gunasthan**, there are 28 **Yogas** and **Bhang**. Here, there are no **Padas**, so instead of **Padas**, we call them **Bhang**. Multiplying 6 by 28, we get 252 **Padavrund** in the **Anivritibadar**. And in the **Sookshma Samparaya**, there are **Yogas** and **Bhang**. Therefore, multiplying 6 by 1, we get the **Bhang**.

Adding the **Padavrund** from the first to the tenth **Gunasthan**, we get a total of 95717 **Padavrund**. It is also said:

"**Sarsasa Sal Saya Pananousahass Payasanka**"

Meaning, considering the **Yogas**, the total **Padavrund** of the **Mohaniyakarma** are 95717.

1. **Panchasangrah Saptathika** verse 120
2. **Go. Karmakanda** verse 468 and 500

Considering the **Yogas**, the **Udayasthan** is 12653 and the **Padavrund** is 85645.

**Text on Karma Granth**

After considering the **udayasthanas**, **bhangas** and **padavrindas** in the **mohaniyak** in the context of **sunavons**, we now consider the **udayasthanas** etc. in the context of **upayogas**.

In the two **gunasthanas** of **mithyatva** and **sasadan**, there are five **upayogas**: **matiagyan**, **shrutagnyan**, **vibhangan** **chakshudarshan** and **achakshudarshan**. In **misra**, there are three **misragyan** and **chakshu** and **achakshu** **darshan**, thus five **upayogas**. In **avirata samyagdristi** and **deshavirata**, there are three **samyagnyan** and three **darshan** at the beginning, thus six **upayogas**. From the sixth **gunasthan** of **pramattasanyata** to the tenth **gunasthan** of **sukshmasampraya**, there are seven **upayogas** in five **gunasthanas**, including the **manparyayagnyan**, in addition to the aforementioned six. The **bhangas** of the **udayasthanas** of each **gunasthan** have been mentioned earlier in the **antarbhashya matha** "**atthag chau chau chauratuga ya**". Therefore, by multiplying the **udayasthanas** of each **gunasthan** by the number of **upayogas** in that **gunasthan** and then dividing by the **bhangas**, the total **bhangas** of that **gunasthan** in relation to **upayogas** can be found. For example, in **mithyatva** and **sasadan**, there are 8 and 4 **chaubisis** respectively, and 5 **upayogas**. Therefore, 8+4=12 multiplied by 5 equals 60. In **mith**, there are 4 **chaubisis** and 5 **upayogas**. Therefore, 4 multiplied by 5 equals 20. In **avirata samyagdristi** and **deshavirata** **gunasthanas**, there are 8 and 8 **chaubisis** respectively, and 6 **upayogas**. Therefore, 8+8=16 multiplied by 6 equals 96. In the **gunasthanas** of **pramat**, **apramattasanyata** and **apuurvakaran**, there are 8, 8 and 4 **chaubisis** respectively, and 7 **upayogas**. Therefore, 8+8+4=20 multiplied by 7 equals 140. The sum of all these is 60+20+96+140 = 316. Each **chaubisi** has 24 **bhangas**. Therefore, multiplying 316 by 24 gives a total of 316 x 24 = 7584. And two **prakritik udayasthanas**... 

Page #334:
---------------------------
266
In the Saptaatika chapter, there are 12 bhangas and in one Prakrutik Udayasthan, there are 5 bhangas, totaling 17. When these are multiplied by the number of possible uses, which is 7, the result is 119. Adding this to the previous amount, the total number of bhangas becomes 7703. It is also said:
"Jappāgunogēsa sagsarismā tikttaṛ hoti."
Meaning: When the Udayasthan alternatives of the Mohaniya are multiplied by the possible uses, their total number is 7703.
However, there is also an opinion regarding the uses in the Misra Gunasthan that in the Samyagmidhyadristi Gunasthan, instead of five, six uses are found, including Aavdhi Darshan. Therefore, accepting this opinion, multiplying the 4 Chaubisi of the Min Gunasthan by 6, we get 24, and multiplying these 24 by 24, we get 576. This means that in this Gunasthan, 66 bhangas are added to the previous 480. Therefore, adding 66 to the previously mentioned 7703 bhangas, the total number of bhangas becomes 7766. Thus, these Udayasthan bhangas multiplied by the uses should be known.
The description of Udayavikalpas in relation to uses is as follows:

Special - When according to other views, there are six uses in Mithya Gunasthan with Abhidarshan, then in comparison to this, when the 66 bhangas obtained are added to the 7703 bhangas, the total Udayavikalpa becomes 7766. Thus, after explaining the Udayavikalpas in comparison to the uses, now the proof of the Padavrindas obtained by multiplying them with the uses is being explained.
Previously in the Bhashya Gatha 'Atthi Battisam ......' the indication of Udayasthan Pada in Gunasthanas has been given. Accordingly, there are 68 Udayasthan Pada in Mithyatva, 32 in Sasadan and 32 in Misra Gunasthan, which add up to 132. Multiplying these by the 5 possible uses in these Gunasthanas, we get 132 x 5 = 660. In Avirat Samyagdristi, there are 60 Udayasthan Pada and in Deshavirat, there are 52 Udayasthan Pada. Their sum is 112, which when multiplied by the 6 possible uses here, becomes 672. Pramattasanyata 

Page #336:
---------------------------
## Chapter on Sapta-Tika
**268**

There are 44 **Udayasthan** positions in **Sapta-Tika**, 44 in **A-prammatta-samyata**, and 20 in **A-purva-karana**. Their total sum is 44 + 44 + 20 = 108. Multiplying this by the 7 possible uses, we get 756. Thus, the sum of all **Udayasthan** positions from the first to the eighth **Gunasthan** is 660 + 672 + 756 = 2088. Multiplying this by 24, the number of **Bhangas**, we get the total number of **Padavandas** for the eight **Gunasthanas** as 2088 x 24 = 50112. 

Next, the **Padavandas** of the two **Prakrutik Udayasthanas** are 24, and the **Padavanda** of one **Prakrutik Udayasthan** is 5, totaling 26. Multiplying these 26 by the 7 possible uses, we get 182. Adding this to the previously mentioned 50112 **Padavandas**, the total number of **Padavandas** becomes 50315. It is also said:

**"Pashnasam cha sahasam timti satha cheva pannara"**

Meaning: When the **Padavandas** of **Mohaniya** are multiplied by the possible uses, their total number becomes 50315.

It is important to note that this number of **Padavandas** is based on the assumption of five uses in **Mishra Gunasthan**. However, when six uses are accepted instead of five, as per a different view, the number of **Padavandas** increases by 132424 = 768 **Bhangas**, and the total number of **Padavandas** becomes 51083 instead of 50315.

The details of **Padavandas** in relation to uses should be understood as follows:

If we add the 768 bhangas of the mixed Gunasthan related to Aavdisharan, then the total Padavrind would be 51083.
Thus, after describing the Udayasthan Padavrind in relation to Usages, now we consider the Udayasthan alternatives and Padavrind in relation to Leshyas. First, we explain the Udayasthan alternatives.
From Mithyatva to Avirat Samyagdristi, in each of these four Gunasthan, there are six Leshyas. Deshavirat, Pramattasanyata and 

Page #338:
---------------------------
## Chapter 700

**Aparammatasanyata** (Non-Negligent Restraint), **In** (within) these three **Gunasthanas** (Stages of Conduct), there are three **Shubh Leshyas** (Auspicious Influences) such as **Tejoleshya** (Influence of Radiance), etc. And in the **Gunasthanas** that follow, such as **Apuvarkarana** (Stage of Non-Retrogression), there is one **Shuklaleshya** (White Influence).

The **Chaubasis** (24) for each of the **Ganasthanas** (Stages of Knowledge) such as **Mithyatva** (False Belief), etc., have been explained earlier. Therefore, according to that, there are 8 **Chaubasis** in **Mithyatva**, 4 in **Sasadan** (Stage of Doubt), 4 in **Mitra** (Stage of Friendship), and 4 in **Avirat Sambandhaat** (Stage of Uninterrupted Connection). The total of these is 24. Multiplying this by 6, we get 24 x 6 = 144. There are 8 **Chaubasis** in **Deshavirat** (Stage of Non-Attachment to Place), 8 in **Pramattavirat** (Stage of Negligent Restraint), and 8 in **Aparammattavirat**. The total of these is 24. Since there are three **Shubh Leshyas** in these three **Ganasthanas**, we get 24 x 3 = 72. There are 4 **Chaubasis** in the **Apuvarkarana** **Gunasthan**, but since there is only one **Shuklaleshya** here, we get only 4. The total number of **Chaubasis** in the aforementioned eight **Gunasthanas** is 144 + 72 + 4 = 220. Multiplying this by 24, we get the total number of **Udayasthan Vikalpas** (Options for Arising) in the eight **Gunasthanas** as 220 x 24 = 5280. Subsequently, adding 12 for two **Prakrutik Udayasthanas** (Natural Options for Arising) and 5 for one **Prakrutik Udayasthan**, we get a total of 17 **Mangas** (Options). Adding these to the total **Udayasthan Vikalpas**, we get 5280 + 17 = 5297. These 5297 are the **Udayasthan Vikalpas** that should be known in relation to the **Leshyas**.

The details of these **Udayasthan Vikalpas** are as follows:

| **Gunasthan** | **Leshya** | **Gunakar** (Multiplier) | **Gunanphal** (Product) (Udayavikalpa) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mithyatva | 24 | 48 | 1152 |

Now, with respect to Leshyas, we will explain the Padavand: 68 for Mithyatva, 32 for Sasadan, 32 for Mith, and 60 for Avira Samyagdristi, totaling 68+32+32+60 = 162. Multiplying these by the possible 6 Leshyas, we get 1152. Then, for Deshavira, 52, for Pramattavira, 44, and for Apramattavira, 44, totaling 140. Multiplying these by the possible 3 Leshyas in these three Gunasthanas, we get 420. And for Apurvakaran, there are 20, but only one Leshya, so its count is 20. Adding all these, we get 1152+420+20 = 1562. Multiplying these 1562 by 24 with respect to Bhangas, we get a total of 38208 Padavand for the eight Gunasthanas. Finally, adding the two Prakrutik and one Prakrutik Padavand, 26, we get a total of 38237 Padavand. It is also said:
"When the three are absent, the remaining one arises, becoming the Leshya. There are 1000 Padavand, and two Sangatis."

After explaining the evidence obtained by multiplying the possible yogas, uses, and leshyas with the alternatives and groups of the उदयस्थान (arising place) related to each गुणस्थान (quality place) of the मोहनीयकर्म (delusion-causing karma), we now consider the सत्तास्थान (existence places) to explain the संवेध भङ्ग (breaking of perception) of the संवेध भक् (perception-possessing beings).

**Breaking of Perception of the Delusion-Causing Karma in the Quality Places**

**तिण्णेगे एगेगं तिग मोसे पंच चउसु नियट्टिए' तिनि । एक्कार बायरम्मी सुहमे चउ तिनि उवसंते ॥ ४८ ॥**

**Word Meaning:**

* **सिण:** Three सत्तास्थान (existence places)
* **एगे:** One in the मिथ्यादृष्टि गुणस्थान (false-view quality place)
* **एगे:** One in the सासादन (coarseness)
* **तिग:** Three in the मिश्र (mixed)

* **सुहमे:** Four in the सूक्ष्मसपराय (subtle-minded)
* **चच:** Four
* **तिग्नि:** Three
* **उबसंते:** Three in the उपशान्त मोह (calm delusion)

**Verse Meaning:**

There are three सत्तास्थान (existence places) in the मिथ्यात्व गुणस्थान (false-view quality place), one in the सासादन (coarseness), three in the मिश्र (mixed), and five in each of the four गुणस्थान (quality places) starting with the अविरत सम्यग्दृष्टि (uninterrupted right view). There are three in the अपूर्वकरण (unprecedented action), eleven in the अनिवृत्तिवादर (non-reversal-like), four in the सूक्ष्मसंपराय (subtle-minded), and three in the उपशान्तमोह (calm delusion).

**Special Meaning:**

The verse describes the सत्तास्थान (existence places) in the गुणस्थान (quality places) of the मोहनीयकर्म (delusion-causing karma). The number of सत्तास्थान (existence places) in each गुणस्थान (quality place) of the मोहनीयकर्म (delusion-causing karma) is:

## Chapter 304: The Seven Tika

The cause of being has already been discussed. Therefore, we will only provide a brief summary here:

* **'Tinnege'**: In the first Mithyatva Gunasthan, there are three Sattastahans: 28, 27, and 26 Prakrutik.
* **'Egegam'**: In the second Sasadan Gunasthan, there is only one Sattastahan: 28 Prakrutik.
* **'Lig Mise'**: In the mixed Gunasthan, there are three Sattastahans: 28, 27, and 24 Prakrutik.
* **'Charguga'**: From the fourth Avira Samyagdristi Gunasthan to the seventh Apmanagan Gunasthan, there are five Sattastahans in each: 28, 24, 23, 22, and 21 Prakrutik.
* **'Apuvrakaran'**: In the eighth Apuvrakaran Gunasthan, there are three Sattastahans: 28, 24, and 21 Prakrutik.
* **'Ekkar Bay Rammi'**: In the ninth Gunasthan - Anivritibadar, there are eleven Sattastahans: 28, 24, 21, 13, 12, 11, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 Prakrutik.
* **'Sukshmasampray'**: In the Sukshmasampray Gunasthan, there are four Sattastahans: 28, 24, 21, and 1 Prakrutik.
* **'Tigni Upasante'**: In the Upshantamoh Gunasthan, there are three Sattastahans: 28, 24, and 21 Prakrutik.

After explaining the Sattastahans of Mohaniyakam in the Gunasthanas, we will now discuss the Samvedh Bhangas as per the context.

**Verse 1:**

* **'Tinnege Egegam Do Missee Chadu Su Pan Niyattie. Tini Pa Thuleyar Suhame Basari Tishni Uvasate.'**

**Explanation:**

* In the Mithyatva Gunasthan, there are 3 Sattastahans, in Sasachan there is 1, in Misra there are 2, and in the four Gunasthanas starting from Avira Samyagdristi, there are 5 each. In Apuvrakaran there are 3, in Anivritibadar there are 11, in Sukshmasampray there are 4, and in Upshantamoh there are 3 Sattastahans.

**Note:**

* The Karmagranth mentions 3 Sattastahans for the Misra Gunasthan, while the Go Karmakand mentions 2. 

Page #343:

## Sixth Karma Granth

**Mithyatva Gunasthan:** 
* 22 Prakruti Bandhastan and 7, 8, 9, and 10 Prakruti are the four Udayasthan. 
* Of these, the 7 Prakruti Udayasthan has only one 28 Prakruti Sattasthan, but the remaining three, 8, 9, and 10 Prakruti Udayasthan have three Sattasthan: 28, 27, and 26 Prakruti. 
* Thus, the total Sattasthan in Mithyatva Gunasthan are 10 (1 + 343 - 10).

**Sasadan Gunasthan:**
* 21 Prakruti Bandhastan and 7, 8, and 9 Prakruti are the three Udayasthan, each having 28 Prakruti Sattasthan. 
* Therefore, there are three Sattasthan here.

**Mishra Gunasthan:**
* 17 Prakruti Bandhastan and 7, 8, and 9 Prakruti are the three Udayasthan, each having three Sattasthan: 28, 27, and 24 Prakruti. 
* Thus, there are a total of six Sattasthan here.

**Avirat Samyagdristi Gunasthan:**
* 17 Prakruti Bandhastan and 6, 7, 8, and 9 Prakruti are the four Udayasthan. 
* The 6 Prakruti Udayasthan has three Sattasthan: 28, 24, and 21 Prakruti. 
* Each of the 7 and 8 Prakruti Udayasthan has five Sattasthan: 28, 24, 23, 22, and 21 Prakruti. 
* The 9 Prakruti Udayasthan has four Sattasthan: 28, 24, 23, and 22 Prakruti. 
* Thus, there are a total of 17 Sattasthan here.

**Deshavirat Gunasthan:**
* 13 Prakruti Bandhastan and 5, 6, 7, and 8 Prakruti are the four Udayasthan. 
* The 5 Prakruti Udayasthan has three Sattasthan: 28, 24, and 21 Prakruti. 
* Each of the 6 and 7 Prakruti Udayasthan has five Sattasthan: 28, 24, 23, 22, and 21 Prakruti. 
* The 8 Prakruti Udayasthan...

## Chapter 7: Sapta-Tika

**Section 306**

In the **Pramat Virat Guna-sthana**, there are four **Satta-sthana** (states of being) in the **Prakruti Bandha-sthana** (state of bondage): 25, 24, 23, and 22. Similarly, there are four **Satta-sthana** in the **Prakruti Udaya-sthana** (state of liberation): 4, 5, 6, and 7.

* In the **Prakruti Udaya-sthana** of 4, there are three **Satta-sthana**: 28, 24, and 21.
* In the **Prakruti Udaya-sthana** of 5 and 6, there are five **Satta-sthana** each: 25, 24, 23, 22, and 21.
* In the **Prakruti Udaya-sthana** of 7, there are four **Satta-sthana**: 28, 24, 23, and 22.

Therefore, there are a total of 17 **Satta-sthana** in the **Pramat Virat Guna-sthana**.

In the **A-pramat Samyata Guna-sthana**, one should know the same 17 **Satta-sthana** as in the **Pramat Samyata Guna-sthana**.

In the **A-purva Karana Guna-sthana**, there are 8 **Prakruti** in the **Bandha-sthana** and 4, 5, and 6 **Prakruti** in the **Udaya-sthana**. Each of these three **Udaya-sthana** has three **Satta-sthana**: 25, 24, and 21. Therefore, there are a total of 6 **Satta-sthana** in this **Guna-sthana**.

In the **A-nivritti Bhadar Guna-sthana**, there are five **Bandha-sthana**: 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 **Prakruti**. There are also two **Udaya-sthana**: 2 and 1 **Prakruti**.

* When there are 3 **Prakruti** in the **Bandha-sthana** and 2 **Prakruti** in the **Udaya-sthana**, there are six **Satta-sthana**: 28, 24, 21, 13, 12, and 11.
* When there are 4 **Prakruti** in the **Bandha-sthana** and 1 **Prakruti** in the **Udaya-sthana**, there are six **Satta-sthana**: 28, 24, 21, 11, and 4.
* When there are 3 **Prakruti** in the **Bandha-sthana** and 1 **Prakruti** in the **Udaya-sthana**, there are five **Satta-sthana**: 28, 24, 21, 4, and 3.
* When there are 2 **Prakruti** in the **Bandha-sthana** and 1 **Prakruti** in the **Udaya-sthana**, there are five **Satta-sthana**: 25, 24, 21, 3, and 2.

21. 2 and 1 Prakruti, these are five Satta Sthana. Thus, there are a total of 27 Satta Sthana here.
In the Sukhma Sampraya Gunasthan, in the absence of bondage, there is one Prakruti Udayasthan and 28, 24, 21 and 1 Prakruti, these are twelve Satta Sthana, and in the Upshanta Moh Gunasthan, without bondage and Uday, there are 28, 24 and 21 Prakruti, these are three Satta Sthana.
The specific discussion of how many Satta Sthana there are while having which bondage and Udayasthan has been done in the context of Ogh Prarupana, so it should be known from there.
In this way, so far, the bondage, etc., places of the remaining seven karmas except for Namakarma have been indicated in the Gunasthanas. Now consider the Sanvedha Bhangas of Namakarma.

## Chapter 71

**23. 25, 26, 26, 26, and 30 Prakṛtis are the six **Aṇḍha-sthānas**. Of these, 23 Prakṛtis are **Bandha-sthānas** for the beings who are capable of binding the **Prakṛtis** of **A-paryāpta Eka-indriya**. After this, there are four **Bhangas** due to the **Bādar** and **Sūkṣma** and the alternatives of each and ordinary. 

**25 Prakṛtis** are **Bandha-sthānas** for the beings who are capable of binding the **Prakṛtis** of **Paryāpta Eka-indriya**, **A-paryāpta Dvī-indriya**, **Trī-indriya**, **Catur-indriya**, **Tiryāñc Pañc-indriya**, and **Manuṣya** **Gati**. Of these, there are 20 **Bhangas** for the **Paryāpta Eka-indriya**, and for the rest, **A-paryāpta Dvī-indriya** etc., there is one **Bhang** each. Thus, there are a total of 25 **Bhangas** for the **25 Prakṛtis** **Bandha-sthānas**.

**26 Prakṛtis** are **Bandha-sthānas** for the beings who are capable of binding the **Prakṛtis** of **Paryāpta Eka-indriya**. There are 16 **Bhangas** for this. And **28 Prakṛtis** are **Bandha-sthānas** for the beings who are capable of binding the **Prakṛtis** of **Devagati** or **Naraka-gati**. Of these, there are 28 **Bhangas** when the **Prakṛtis** of **Devagati** are bound, and there is 1 **Bhang** when the **Prakṛtis** of **Naraka-gati** are bound. Thus, there are 29 **Bhangas** for the **28 Prakṛtis** **Bandha-sthānas**.

**26 Prakṛtis** are **Bandha-sthānas** for the beings who are capable of binding the **Prakṛtis** of **Paryāpta Dvī-indriya**, **Trī-indriya**, **Catur-indriya**, **Tiryāñc Pañc-indriya**, and **Manuṣya** **Gati**. Of these, there are eight **Bhangas** each for the **26 Prakṛtis** when the **Prakṛtis** of **Paryāpta Dvī-indriya**, **Trī-indriya**, and **Catur-indriya** are bound. There are 4608 **Bhangas** for the **26 Prakṛtis** when the **Prakṛtis** of **Tiryāñc Pañc-indriya** are bound, and there are also 4608 **Bhangas** for the **26 Prakṛtis** when the **Prakṛtis** of **Manuṣya** **Gati** are bound. Thus, there are a total of 40 **Bhangas** for the **26 Prakṛtis** **Bandha-sthānas**.

**26 Prakṛtis** **Bandha-sthānas** do not occur with **Mithyā-dṛṣṭi** for the **Tīrthankara** **Prakṛti** along with **Devagati**, because the binding of the **Tīrthankara** **Prakṛti** is **Samyak-tvā**...

## 6 Karma Granth

**311**  It is said that the 30 natural bondage places are not suitable for the path of gods because they are caused by the wrong view. 

**30**  Each bondage place is suitable for the four-sense, five-sense, and the wandering five-sense beings.  There are 8 breaks for each of the 30 natural tendencies suitable for the two-sense, three-sense, and four-sense beings.  There are 46.08 breaks for the 30 natural tendencies suitable for the wandering five-sense beings.  Therefore, there are a total of 4632 breaks for the 30 natural bondage places.

Although the 30 natural tendencies suitable for the human path are bound with the Tirthankara nature and the 30 natural tendencies suitable for the path of gods are bound with the Aharakdvik nature, both of these places are not possible with the wrong view.  This is because the Tirthankara nature is bound due to Samyaktva (right faith) and the Aharakdvik nature is bound due to Samyama (self-control).  It is also said:

**Sammattagunanimittam Tityayar Sanjamen Aharam**

Meaning: The Tirthankara is bound due to Samyaktva and the Aharakdvik is bound due to Samyama.  Therefore, the 30 natural bondage places suitable for the human path and the path of gods are not mentioned here.

In the same way, the breaks of the 23 natural bondage places, etc., caused by the wrong view are also mentioned in the Antarbhashya Matha.  The verse of the Bhashya is as follows:

**Chan Panavisa Solas Nav Pattala Saya Ya Vanauya. Battis Uttarchayaalasapa Micchass Bamdhaviho.**

**1**  The 29 natural tendencies, including the Tirthankara, are bound by the wrong view.  The Tirthankara is bound due to the lack of faith in Samyaktva and the wrong view is bound due to the lack of self-control.

## Chapter 73: Mithyaashti

**Meaning:** Mithyaashti. The 21, 5.26, 4, and 3 natural bandhasthanas of the Jiva have 4, 25, 16, 6, 6240, and 4632 bhangas respectively.

The 31 and 1 natural bandhasthanas of the Jiva are not possible, hence they are not considered here.

Thus, the six bandhasthanas of the Mithyaadrishti gunasthana have been stated. Now, the udayasthana are described: 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31 natural, these are the nine udayasthana. Their detailed description has been given earlier in relation to different Jivas, hence they should be understood in the same way here.

The only difference is that here, the bhangas related to Aharak-samyata, Vaikriya-samyata, and Kevali should not be mentioned, because these are not Mithyaashti Jivas.

In the Mithyaashti gunasthana, the total bhangas of these udayasthana are 7773. They are as follows:

The 21 natural udayasthana has 41 bhangas. 5 for Ekendriya, 6 for Vikalendriya, 6 for Tiryanch Panchendriya, 6 for Manushya, 8 for Deva, and 1 for Naraka. Their total is 41.

The 24 natural udayasthana has 11 bhangas, which are found in Ekendriya. The 24 natural udayasthana is not possible elsewhere.

The 25 natural udayasthana has 32 bhangas: 7 for Ekendriya, 6 for Vaikriya Tiryanch Panchendriya, 8 for Vaikriya Manushya, 5 for Deva, and 1 for Naraka. Their total is 7 + 6 + 8 + 5 + 1 = 32.

The 26 natural udayasthana has 600 bhangas: 13 for Ekendriya, 6 for Vikalendriya, 286 for Tiryanch Panchendriya, and 286 for Manushya. Their total is 13 + 6 + 286 + 286 = 600.

The 27 natural udayasthana has 31 bhangas: 6 for Ekendriya, 8 for Vaikriya Tiryanch Panchendriya, 8 for Vaikriya Manushya, 8 for Deva, and 1 for Naraka.

The 28 natural udayasthana has 1196 bhangas...

| **Vaikriya Manushya** (Transformed Humans) - 8 |
| **Deva** (Gods) - 16 |
| **Naraka** (Hell beings) - 1 |

**Total:** 6 + 576 + 16 + 576 + 8 + 16 + 1 = **1166**

**26th Prakrutik Udayasthan** (Natural Arising Place) has **1781** Bhang (Bonds):

| **Vikaleendri** - 12 |
| **Tiyach Panchendri** - 1152 |
| **Vaikriya Tiyach Panchendri** - 16 |
| **Manushya** - 576 |
| **Vaikriya Manushya** - 0 |
| **Deva** - 16 |
| **Naraka** - 1 |

**Total:** 12 + 1152 + 16 + 576 + 0 + 16 + 1 = **1781**

**30th Prakrutik Udayasthan** has **2614** Bhang:

| |
|---|
| **Vikaleendri** - 18 |
| **Tiyach Panchendri** - 1728 |
| **Vaikriya Tiyach Panchendri** - 0 |
| **Manushya** - 1152 |
| **Deva** - 8 |

**Total:** 18 + 1728 + 0 + 1152 + 8 = **2614**

**31st Prakrutik Udayasthan** has **1964** Bhang:

| |
|---|
| **Vikaleendri** - 12 |
| **Tiyach Panchendri** - 1152 |

**Total:** 12 + 1152 = **1164**

Therefore, in the Mithyadrishti Gunasthan (State of False Belief), there are nine Udayasthan: 21st, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, and 31st. They have 41, 11, 32, 600, 31, 1166, 1781, 2614, and 1164 Bhang respectively. The total number of Bhang in these Udayasthan is **7773**.

Although the total number of Bhang in these Udayasthan is 7761, we subtract 7 Bhang for the Kevali (Omniscient) and Aharak Sadhu (Ascetic with food restriction) and 3 Bhang for the Vaikriya Manushya with Udyot (Effort), resulting in **7773** Bhang.

In the Mithyadrishti Gunasthan, there are six Sattasthan (States of Being): 62nd, 81st, 86th, 86th, 80th, and 78th Prakrutik. The 93rd Prakrutik Sattasthan, which is the state of Aharak Chatushk (Fourfold Aharak) and Tirthankara, is not mentioned because they cannot coexist.

The 62nd Prakrutik Sattasthan is possible for all four Gati (States of Existence) of Mithyadrishti Jivas (Beings with False Belief) because the Aharak Chatushk can be born in any Gati. The 81st Prakrutik Sattasthan is not possible for everyone, but it is possible for those who, after binding the Naraka (Hell) Karma, become Vedak (Knowers). 

Page #352:
---------------------------
## Chapter 73

A being with right faith (Samyakdrishti) who binds the nature of a Tirthankara, and at the end of time attains false faith (Mithyatva) and goes to hell, has the existence of 89 natures until the moment of death (Antarmuhurta) in that false faith. The existence of 88 natures is possible for beings of false faith in all four paths, as there is no obstacle in the existence of natures for beings of false faith in the lower realms. The existence of 86 and 80 natures is for those one-sensed beings who have attained the natures suitable for the divine path (Devagati) and the hell path (Narakagati) respectively. When these beings, after leaving the one-sensed state, are born as two-sensed, multi-sensed, five-sensed animals, and humans, they also have the existence of 86 and 80 natures until the moment of death, after all their karmas have matured. However, after this, due to the binding of the body, etc., the existence of these natures does not remain. The existence of 78 natures is for those beings with fire-like bodies (Agnikayik) and air-like bodies (Vayukayik) who have attained the natures suitable for the human path (Manushya Gati) and the path preceding the human path (Manushyanupurvi). When these beings die and are reborn as two-sensed and multi-sensed animals, they also have the existence of 78 natures until the moment of death. Thus, in the state of false faith (Mithyatva Gunasthan), one should know these six states of existence: 12, 86, 88, 86, 80, and 78 natures.

Now, after discussing the binding, arising, and existence states in the state of false faith (Mithyatva Gunasthan) in general, we consider their influence (Sanvegh).

A being of false faith who binds 23 natures has the possibility of the nine arising states mentioned earlier. However, the six arising states of 21, 25, 27, 28, 29, and 30 natures do not have the destruction related to the divine and hell realms. This is because in the binding state of 23 natures, the binding of natures suitable for imperfect one-sensed beings occurs, but not for imperfect one-sensed beings who are destined for the divine realms. 

Page #353:
---------------------------
## Sixth Chapter of the Varmagrantha

- **Suitable** **karmas** do not bind **Devas** (gods), because they are not born in **apeksha** (limited) **ekendriya** (single-sensed) beings. Similarly, **Narakas** (hell beings) do not bind **23 karmas**, because **Narakas** do not bind **karmas** suitable for **ekendriya** beings, even in their **samanya** (general) state. This proves that **Devas** and **Narakas** do not have **bhang** (destruction) related to their **udayasthan** (birthplace) in the **23 karma bandha** (binding) state. Here, there are five **sattaasthan** (states of existence): **62, 68, 86, 80, and 7 karmas**.

- In the four **udayasthan** of **21, 24, 25, and 26 karmas**, there are all five **sattaasthan** mentioned above. In the five **udayasthan** of **27, 28, 29, 30, and 31 karmas**, there are four **sattaasthan** each, excluding **78 karmas**. Thus, there are a total of **40 sattasthan** in all **udayasthan**. However, there is a special feature: in the **25 karma udayasthan**, the **78 karma sattasthan** are only for **agnikayik** (fire-bodied) and **vayukayik** (air-bodied) beings. Similarly, in the **26 karma udayasthan**, the **78 karma sattasthan** are also for **agnikayik** and **vayukayik** beings. And, for those **agnikayik** and **vayukayik** beings who die and are reborn as **vikaleindriya** (disabled) and **tiryanch** (animal) **panchendriya** (five-sensed) beings, there is a certain period of **tava** (suffering).

- The same explanation should be applied to the **25** and **26 karma bandha** states. However, there is a special feature: even while residing in all their **udayasthan**, **Devas** bind **25** and **26 karmas** suitable for **paryapt** (sufficient) **ekendriya** beings. But, after the **25 karma bandha**, only **eight bhang** (destruction) occur for **paryapt** and **praayogya** (suitable) **karmas**, while the remaining **12 bhang** do not occur. This is because **Devas** are not born in **sukshma** (subtle), **sadharan** (ordinary), and **apeksha** (limited) beings. Therefore, they do not bind **karmas** suitable for these beings. Similarly, there are **40 sattasthan** here as well.

- Those who bind **28 karmas** and have **mithya drishti** (false belief) have two **udayasthan**: **30** and **31 karmas**. Of these, the **30 karma udayasthan**...

## Chapter 316: The Seven Tika

This chapter discusses the five senses and the natural states of existence for both the Tiryanch (animals) and humans. 

**Natural States of Existence:**

* **Tiryanch (animals) and humans both have natural states of existence.**
* **Tiryanch (animals) have five natural states of existence:** 62, 86, 88, and 86.
* **30 natural states of existence include all four states.**
* **Within these 30, 6 natural states are specific to those who have the Tirthankara nature and who, after falling into Mithyatva (false belief), bind 28 natures, making them eligible for Naraka (hell).**
* **The remaining three natural states are common to most Tiryanch (animals) and humans.**
* **31 natural states of existence include all three states except for 86.**
* **The 86 natural state of existence is associated with the Tirthankara nature, but Tiryanch (animals) cannot attain the Tirthankara nature. Therefore, the 86 natural state of existence is excluded from the 31 natural states.**
* **In the 28 natural states of bondage, there are 7 states of existence compared to the 30 and 31 natural states of existence.**

**States of Existence for Mithyatva (False Belief) Bound Beings:**

* **Except for the 29 natural states of bondage that are eligible for Devagati (heavenly realm), the remaining 26 natures that bind beings with impaired senses, Tiryanch (animals) with five senses, and humans, are associated with six states of existence for Mithyatva (false belief) bound beings.**
* **These six states are: 1 (common to all), 62, 86, 88, 86, 80, and 78.**
* **21 natural states of existence include all six states.**
* **The 86 natural state of existence is specific to beings who, after binding the Naraka (hell) nature, attain Vedaka Samyaktv (perfect knowledge) and bind the Tirthankara nature.**
* **Subsequently, those who fall into Mithyatva (false belief) and die, are reborn in Naraka (hell). The 62 and 88 natural states of existence are specific to Devas (gods), Narakas (hell beings), humans, beings with impaired senses, Tiryanch (animals) with five senses, and beings with one sense.**
* **The 86 and 80 natural states of existence are specific to beings with impaired senses, Tiryanch (animals) with five senses, humans, and beings with one sense.**

## Sixth Karma Granth, Chapter 317

One should know the **Sattastana** (state of being) in relation to the 78 **Prakrutis** (natural tendencies). These **Sattastana** are for **Ekendriya** (one-sensed), **Vikalendriya** (imperfect-sensed), and **Tiryanch Panchendriya** (five-sensed animals). 

In the 24 **Prakrutik Udayastana** (stages of development), there are 5 **Sattastana** excluding the 86 **Prakrutis**. These 5 **Sattastana** should be known in relation to all **Ekendriya** beings, as the other beings do not have 24 **Prakrutik Udayastana** except for the **Ekendriya**.

In the 25 **Prakrutik Udayastana**, there are all six **Sattastana** mentioned earlier. Their specific consideration should be known similar to the 21 **Prakrutik Udayastana**.

In the 26 **Prakrutik Udayastana**, there are five **Sattastana** excluding the 8 **Prakrutis**. The reason for the absence of these 8 **Prakrutis** is that the **Sattastana** of the being who is born in **Naraka** (hell) exists in the **Mithyatva Gunasthan** (state of false belief), but **Naraka** does not have 26 **Prakrutik Udayastana**.

In the 27 **Prakrutik Udayastana**, there are five **Sattastana** excluding the 78 **Prakrutis**. The discussion regarding the 86 **Prakrutik Sattastana** should be known as before, and the 62 **Prakrutik Sattastana** should be known in relation to **Deva** (gods), **Naraka**, **Manushya** (humans), **Vikalendriya**, **Tiryanch Panchendriya**, and **Ekendriya**.

The 56 and 80 **Prakrutik Sattastana** should be known in relation to **Ekendriya**, **Vikalendriya**, **Tiryanch Panchendriya**, and **Manushya**. The reason for not mentioning the 78 **Prakrutik Sattastana** here is that the 27 **Prakrutik Udayastana** exist for **Agnikaayik** (fire-bodied) and **Vayukaayik** (air-bodied) beings, except for **Atap** (sun) or **Udyot** (moon) along with other **Ekendriya**, or for **Naraka**. However, these beings do not possess the 78 **Prakrutis**.

In the 28 **Prakrutik Udayastana**, these same five **Sattastana** exist. Therefore, the discussion regarding the 2, 86, and **Prakrutik Sattastana** is as before, and the 56 and **M** **Prakrutik** (the specific number is missing in the text) **Sattastana** should be known in relation to **Vikalendriya**, **Tiryanch Panchendriya**, and **Manushya**.

Similarly, in the 29 **Prakrutik Udayastana**, these five **Sattastana** should be known. In the 30 **Prakrutik...**

## The Chapter of Seven Tika

In the **Udayasthan** (state of arising), there are four **Sattastahan** (states of existence) for the **62, 88, 86, and 80 Prakruti** (types of beings): these are to be known in relation to **Vikalendriya** (disabled senses), **Tiyanch Panchendriya** (animals with five senses), and **humans**. **Narakas** (hells) do not have 30 **Prakruti** **Udayasthan**, therefore, the 86 **Prakruti** is not mentioned here. In each **Udayasthan**, these same four **Sattastahan** exist, which are to be known in relation to **Vikalendriya** and **Tiyanch Panchendriya**. Thus, a **Mithyadristi** (false-sighted) being who binds 26 **Prakruti** has 45 **Sattastahan**.

For beings eligible for **Manushya** (human) and **Devagati** (heavenly) realms, the 30 **Prakruti** **Bandhastan** (states of bondage) are excluded. The remaining **Vikalendriya** and **Tiyanch Panchendriya** beings, who bind 30 **Prakruti**, have six **Udayasthan** as mentioned earlier, excluding the 86, and the remaining five **Sattastahan**. Here, the 89 **Prakruti** **Sattastahan** is not possible because a being with 89 **Prakruti** **Sattastahan** does not bind **Tiyanch** (animal) **Gati** (realm) **Prakruti**. In these four **Udayasthan** of **21, 24, 25, and 26 Prakruti**, the five **Sattastahan** are to be known as before. The remaining **Udayasthan** of **27, 28, 29, 30, and 31 Prakruti** have four **Sattastahan** each, excluding the 78 **Prakruti**. Thus, a **Mithyadristi** being who binds 30 **Prakruti** has a total of 40 **Sattastahan**.

The description of the **Bandha** (bondage), **Udaya** (arising), and **Sattastahan** (states of existence) of a **Mithyadristi** being, and their **Samvedha** (perception), is complete. This is how it should be understood.

30 Although there are many varieties of the 30 natural bondage places, only one with a single effort is suitable for binding in the Sasadan and is applicable to the Tiryanch. This is bound by the Sasadan, the one-sensed, the multi-sensed, the Tiryanch, the five-sensed, the human, the divine, and the hellish beings. It has a total of 3200 breaks. Thus, in the Sasadan Gunasthan, there are three bondage places and their 8 + 6400 + 3200 - 608 breaks. The same is said in the commentary verse.
A Say Poosh Battis Saya Ya Sasane Meya.
ager
Sambaan'avahin
Chhan Uyi.  Meaning, in the Sasadan, there are 6400 and 3200 varieties of the 28 initial bondage places in order, and all of them together are 6608.
Thus, three bondage places are mentioned in the Sasadan Gunasthan. Now, the direction of the Udayasthan is given, that 21, 24, 25, 26, 29, 30, and 31 natural, these are the seven Udayasthan.
.
Of these, the 21 natural Udayasthan are of the one-sensed, the multi-sensed, the controlled, the five-sensed, the human, and the divine. In the hellish beings, the Sasadan Samyakdrishti beings are not born, so the 21 natural Udayasthan of the hellish beings are not mentioned in the Sasadan. While the one-sensed have 21 natural Udayasthan, with the Badar and the Paryapt, there are two possible breaks due to the alternative of Yash-Kirti, because the Sasadan Jina is not born in the subtle and the insufficient, so the one-one break that occurs with each and the insufficient in the multi-sensed, the Tiryanch, the five-sensed, and the humans is not possible here. The remaining breaks are possible, which are two-two for the multi-sensed, thus six, and for the Tiryanch, the five-sensed, the humans, and the divine. Thus, the total number of breaks for the 21 natural Udayasthan is 32 (2 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 832).

## Sixth Karma Granth, 323

**24.** The 24th natural उदयस्थान (state of arising) occurs only in those beings who are born as one-sensed beings. Here, there are only two types of भंग (breakage) due to the alternatives of sufficient and insufficient केकीति (knowledge) and यशःकीर्ति (fame) and अयशःकीर्ति (infamy). The remaining भंग do not occur because in the case of subtle, ordinary, agnikayik (fire-bodied) and vayukayik (air-bodied) beings, the सासादन (state of being a Samyagdrishti) does not arise.

**25.** In the सासादन गुणस्थान (state of being a Samyagdrishti), the 25th natural उदयस्थान is attained by those who are born as gods. Its भंग occur due to the alternatives of stable, unstable, auspicious, inauspicious, यशःकीर्ति (fame) and अयशःकीर्ति (infamy).

**26.** The 26th natural उदयस्थान occurs only in those who are born as विकलेन्द्रिय (disabled), तिर्यंच (animal), पंचेन्द्रिय (five-sensed) and humans. In the case of insufficient beings, the सासादन (state of being a Samyagdrishti) does not arise. Therefore, in this state, the one भंग that is found with the insufficient is not possible here, but the remaining भंग are possible. There are two भंग for each विकलेन्द्रिय, thus six in total, 288 for तिर्यंच पंचेन्द्रिय, and 288 for humans. Thus, the 26th natural उदयस्थान has a total of 582 भंग.

**27 & 28.** The reason why the 27th and 28th natural उदयस्थान do not occur in the सासादन गुणस्थान (state of being a Samyagdrishti) is that they occur after the passage of one अन्तर्मुहूर्त (a very short period of time) of the new birth, but the सासादन भाव (state of being a Samyagdrishti) is attained for a maximum of six आवली काल (a very long period of time) after its origin. Therefore, the said 27th and 28th natural उदयस्थान are not considered to be सासादन सम्यग्दृष्टि (a Samyagdrishti who has attained the सासादन state).

**29.** The 26th natural उदयस्थान occurs for the पर्याप्त (sufficient) देव (gods) and नारक (hell beings) who have fallen from their first सम्यक्त्व (right knowledge). In the 26th natural उदयस्थान, there is one भंग for gods and one for hell beings, thus a total of two भंग here.

## Translation:

**324**
**Chapter on the Seven Tika**

**30** The first *udayasthan* (stage of arising) from the state of *samyaktv* (perfect knowledge) is for *tiryanch* (non-human beings) and humans, and for the gods who exist in response to them. There are 1152 *udayasthan* for each of the *tiryanch* and humans, and 6 for the gods. Thus, there are 1152 + 1152 + 6 = 2312 *bhang* (destructions).

**31** The first *udayasthan* from the state of *samyaktv* is for *tiryanch*. Here, there are a total of 1152 *bhang*. Thus, there are 7 *udayasthan* and their *bhang* in the *sasadan* (state of existence) *gunasthan* (stage of qualities). These *bhang* are also counted in the *bhashya* (commentary) *gatha* (verse) as follows:

*Basīs bonni aṭṭa ya bāsīpa saya ya pancha nava udaya. Pāhiga vīsa pāpagnēkāras saya.*

This means that the 21st, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 30th, and 31st *prakritik* (natural) *udayasthan* of the *sasadan* *gunasthan* have 32, 2, 8, 582, 6, 2312, and 1152 *bhang* respectively.

After explaining the seven *udayasthan* of the *sasadan* *gunasthan*, we now need to explain the *sattaasthan* (stages of existence). There are two *sattaasthan*, the 62nd and 88th *prakritik*. The 62nd *satta* is attained by those who, having bound the *aharaka chatushk* (fourfold food) and become free from *upshamni* (hindrance), attain the *sasadan* state. The 88th *satta* is attained by the *sasadan* beings of all four *gati* (paths).

Thus, one should understand the *bandh* (bondage), *uday*, and *sattaasthan* of the *sasadan* *gunasthan*. Now, let us consider their *sanvedh* (perception).

The *sasadan* *savyagdristi* (those who have clear vision) who bind the 20th *prakritik* have 30...

## Sixth Karma-Manas

**325**

**31** There are two **Udayasthanas** (places of arising): **30** and **31** **Prakritis**. While discussing **Bandhastanas** (places of bondage) earlier, it was mentioned that **Sāsādan** beings, who are capable of attaining **Devagati** (heavenly state), bind **26** **Prakritis**, while **Namātrātrākor** beings bind **18** **Prakritis**. However, even among **Sāsādan** beings, only those who are **Karana-paryāpta** (sufficient in their karmic causes) are capable of binding **Devagati**. Therefore, apart from these two **Udayasthanas** (**30** and **31** **Prakritis**), no other **Udayasthanas** are possible.

Now, if we consider the **Udayasthanas** of **30** **Prakritis** in relation to humans, then two **Sattasthanas** (places of existence) are possible: **62** and **88** **Prakritis**. However, if we consider the **Udayasthanas** of **30** **Prakritis** in relation to **Tiryach** (non-human) beings with five senses, then only one **Sattasthan** is possible: **88** **Prakritis**. This is because the **Sattasthan** of **62** **Prakritis** is only attained by those who have fallen from the **Upasama-śreṇi** (state of calmness) and have attained the **Sāsādan** state. However, the **Upasama-śreṇi** is not possible for **Tiryach** beings. Therefore, the **Sattasthan** of **62** **Prakritis** is excluded here.

For **Sāsādan** beings who bind **26** **Prakritis**, which is possible for both **Tiryach** beings with five senses and humans, all seven previously mentioned **Udayasthanas** are possible. Among these, all **Udayasthanas** except for the **Udayasthan** of **30** **Prakritis** result in the **Sattasthan** of **88** **Prakritis**. However, in the **Udayasthan** of **30** **Prakritis**, both **Sattasthanas** are possible for humans: **62** and **88** **Prakritis**. The **Bandhastan** of **30** **Prakritis** should be mentioned as equal to the **Bandhastan** of **26** **Prakritis**.

In the **Udayasthan** of **31** **Prakritis**, only the **Sattasthan** of **31** **Prakritis** is attained. This is because the **Udayasthan** of **31** **Prakritis** is only attained by **Tiryach** beings.

Thus, there are a total of **8** **Sattasthanas** in the **Sāsādan** **Gunasthan** (state of karmic qualities). The details of **Bandhastanas**, **Udayasthanas**, **Sattasthanas**, and their relationships in the **Sāsādan** **Gunasthan** should be understood in this way.

## Sixth Karma Granth
(3) Mixed Gunasthan

After explaining the Bandha (bond) etc. locations of the second Sasadan Gunasthan, we now discuss the five etc. locations of the third Mixed Gunasthan. In the Mixed Gunasthan, there are two Bandha (bond) locations, three Udaya (arising) locations, and two Satya (existence) locations. Their details are as follows:

28 and 26 Prakruti (natural) are the Bandha (bond) locations. Of these, 28 Prakruti Bandha (bond) locations are for Tiryanch (animals) and humans, as they bind the Prakruti (natural) suitable for Dev (heavenly) state in the Mixed Gunasthan. There are 8 Bhang (divisions) here.

26 Prakruti Bandha (bond) locations are for Dev (heavenly) and Narak (hell) beings. This is because they bind the Prakruti (natural) suitable for human state in the Mixed Gunasthan. There are also 8 Bhang (divisions) here.

In both locations, these Bhang (divisions) are obtained from the alternatives of stable-unstable, auspicious-inauspicious, and fame-infamy. 24242, the remaining Bhang (divisions) are not obtained because only the remaining auspicious Paravartaman (transmigrating) Prakruti (natural) are bound by Samyak (right) and Mithyadristi (wrong) vision beings.

After mentioning the Bandha (bond) locations, we now explain the Udaya (arising) locations. 26, 30, and 31 Prakruti are these three Udaya (arising) locations. 29 Prakruti Udaya (arising) location is for Dev (heavenly) and Narak (hell) beings. This location has 8 Bhang (divisions) for Dev (heavenly) and 1 for Narak (hell), totaling 6 Bhang (divisions). 30 Prakruti Udaya (arising) location is for Tiryanch (animals) and humans. It has 1152 Bhang (divisions) for Tiryanch (animals) and 1152 for humans, totaling 2304. 31 Prakruti Udaya (arising) location is only for Tiryanch (animals) with five senses. It has a total of 1152 Bhang (divisions). Thus, in the Mixed Gunasthan, the three Udaya (arising) locations have 6 + 2304 + 1152 = 3465 Bhang (divisions).

In the Mixed Gunasthan, there are two Satya (existence) locations - 62 and 88 Prakruti. Thus, the Bandha (bond), Udaya (arising), and Satya (existence) locations of the Mixed Gunasthan should be understood as 2, 3, and 2 respectively.

## The Chapter of the Seven Tika

The bondage of the substances (Prakṛtis) and the arising of the substances (Prakṛtis), these are the two arisings. 
The thirty and thirty-one stages of the Right-seeing (Samyakdṛṣṭi) and the Wrong-seeing (Mithyā-dṛṣṭi) and the sixty-two and the seven stages in each arising stage are considered by those who contemplate this. 
There are twenty-six stages of arising of the substances (Prakṛtis) for one who is bound by twenty-six substances (Prakṛtis) and sixty-two and the seven stages of existence. 
In the mixed quality stage (Miśra Guṇasthāna), there are six stages of existence for three stages of arising. 

The details of the bondage, arising, and existence stages of the mixed quality stage should be known as follows:

| Bondage Stage | Substances (Prakṛtis) | Arising Stage | Substances (Prakṛtis) | Existence Stage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 25 | 26 | 20 | 31 | 62.85 |
| 2 | 8 | 26 | 3 | 62.88 |
| Mang | 15 | - | - | 62.88 |
| - | 16 | - | - | 6 |

**(4) The Uninterrupted Right-seeing Quality Stage (Avirata Samyakdṛṣṭi Guṇasthāna)**

After explaining the bondage, etc., stages in the mixed quality stage, now we explain the bondage, etc., stages in the fourth Uninterrupted Right-seeing Quality Stage. In this quality stage, there are three bondage stages, eight arising stages, and four existence stages - 'Tigatthacaca!' They should be known as follows: 25, 26...

## Sixth Karma Granth

**329 and 30 Prakruti are the three Bandha Sthana. Of these, the 28 Prakruti Bandha Sthana of Avirat Samyagdrishti Tiryanch and humans, who bind the Prakruti suitable for Devagati, are present. Avirat Samyagdrishti Tiryanch and humans do not bind the Prakruti suitable for the remaining Gati, therefore, the 28 Prakruti Bandha Sthana suitable for Narakagati is not present here.**

**26 Prakruti Bandha Sthana is obtained in two ways. One is for humans who bind with the Tirthankara Prakruti along with the Prakruti suitable for Devagati. It has 8 Bhang. The second is for Devas and Narakas who bind with the Prakruti suitable for Manushya Gati. Here also, there are 8 Bhang. The 30 Prakruti Bandha Sthana of Devas and Narakas who bind with the Tirthankara Prakruti along with the Prakruti suitable for Manushya Gati is present. It also has 8 Bhang.**

**Now, we will explain the 8 Udaya Sthana. In the Avirat Samyagdrishti Gunasthan, 21, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 and 31 Prakruti are the 8 Udaya Sthana. Of these, the 21 Prakruti Udaya Sthana should be known for Narakas, Tiryanch Panchendriya, humans and Devas. Because, for one who has attained Kshayik Samyagdarshan after the binding of Ayukarma, the 21 Prakruti Udaya Sthana is possible in all four Gati. But, Avirat Samyagdrishti does not arise in Apariapta, therefore, excluding the Bhang related to Apariapta, the remaining Bhang...**

**...1. For humans, 31 Prakruti is bound along with the Tirthankara, suitable for Devagati. Here also, there are 8 Bhang. For Devas and Narakas, 31 Prakruti is bound, suitable for Manushya Gati. Here also, there are 8 Bhang. For them, 30 Prakruti is bound along with the Tirthankara, suitable for Manushya Gati. Here also, there are 8 Bhang.**

Chapter of the Seventies
,
There are 25 total, which are the 6+6+8-1 of the gods, hell beings, and humans of the five-sensed beings. 
One should know the 25 and 27 natural arising places of the gods and hell beings, and the reacting animals and humans. Here, the 25 and 27 natural places of the hell beings and gods are said to be the owner of the hell beings, the omniscient with destruction, or the omniscient with destruction. The god is one with any of the three omnisciences. In the Churni, it is said in the same way:
"Twenty-five - two hundred and seventy - in the world of the non-liberated, the liberated, and the humans, it is said. Hell beings - the omniscient with destruction, the god - the omniscient with three."
That is, in the state of the uninterrupted omniscience, there are 25 and 27 natural arising places of the gods, hell beings, and reacting animals and humans. So, of these, the hell being is either the omniscient with destruction or the omniscient with destruction, but the god is one of the three omnisciences.
The 26 natural arising places are of the omniscient with destruction or the omniscient with destruction, and of the humans. The omniscient with destruction being does not arise in the animals and humans. Therefore, the three types of omniscient beings are not mentioned here. Even in that, one should know the omniscience with destruction in relation to the existence of the 22 natures of the delusion of the animals.
1 Twenty-five, twenty-seven arising places, gods, hell beings, reacting animals, and humans, are to be understood by the authority. There, the hell being is the omniscient with destruction, the omniscient with destruction, the god is also the omniscient with three. - Commentary on the Chapter of the Seventies, p. 230 

Page #369:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karma Granth

**331**  The 28 and 26 natural upadayas (arising) occur for the uninterrupted Samyagdarshi (right-seeing) beings in all four gatis (states of existence). **30** The natural upadaya occurs for the Panchendriya (five-sensed), humans, and Devas (gods), and **31** the natural upadaya occurs only for the Panchendriya. In this way, one should know that there are 8 upadaya sthana (places of arising) in the uninterrupted Samyagdarshi gunasthana (state of qualities).

Now, we will discuss the satta sthana (places of existence).

In the uninterrupted Samyagdarshi gunasthana, there are four satta sthana: 63, 92, 86, and 8 natural. Of these, the one who has bound 31 prakritis (natural tendencies) with the Tirthankara and Aharaka (food-giver) in the Aprammatta-samyata (unwavering restraint) and Apurvakarana (unprecedented action) gunasthana, and after death became an uninterrupted Samyagdarshi, has 63 prakritis in his satta. The one who first bound the Aharaka Chatushk (four food-givers) and then, due to a change in the parinam (transformation), went into Mithyatva (false belief) and was born in one of the four gatis, upon attaining Samyagdarshan (right-seeing) again in that gati, has 62 natural satta sthana in all four gatis. However, for Devas and humans, the 62 natural satta sthana is formed in this uninterrupted Samyagdarshi gunasthana without attaining Mithyatva. The 86 natural satta sthana occurs for the uninterrupted Samyagdarshi Devas, Narakas (hell beings), and humans. Because in these three gatis, the Tirthankara prakriti is constantly being assimilated. However, a being with the Tirthankara prakriti in his satta is not born in the Tiryancha (animal) gati, therefore, the Tiryancha are not included here. The 88 natural satta sthana occurs for the uninterrupted Samyagdarshi beings in all four gatis. In this way, one should know the bandha (binding), upadaya, and satta sthana in the uninterrupted Samyagdarshi gunasthana.

Now, we will consider their samvaidha (relationship) - that of the uninterrupted Samyagdarshi being who has bound 28 prakritis, in comparison to the Tiryancha and humans... 

Page #370:

## Chapter 73

There are 8 **Udayasthanas**. Out of these, 25 and 27 are **Prakrutik Udayasthanas** for **Tiryanch** and **Manushya** respectively, while the remaining six are **common**. Each of these **Udayasthanas** has two **Sattaasthanas**, 62 and 86 **Prakrutik**.

The **Prakrutik Bandhasthanas** are of two types, **Devagatiprayogya** and **ManushyaGatiprayogya**, with 26 **Prakrutik**. The **Devagatiprayogya** includes **Tirthankara** nature, and only **Manushya** bind to it. However, **Manushya** have seven **Prakrutik Udayasthanas**: 21, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30. **Manushya** do not have a 31st **Prakrutik Udayasthanas**. Each of these **Udayasthanas** also has two **Sattaasthanas**, 63 and 86 **Prakrutik**. The **ManushyaGatiprayogya** 26 **Prakrutik** are bound by **Devas** and **Narakas**.

Out of these, **Narakas** have five **Udayasthanas**: 21, 25, 27, 28, and 26 **Prakrutik**. **Devas** have six **Udayasthanas**: the aforementioned five and 30 **Prakrutik**. Each of these **Udayasthanas** has two **Sattaasthanas**, 12 and 88 **Prakrutik**. The **ManushyaGatiyogya** 30 **Prakrutik** are bound by **Devas** and **Narakas**. Out of these, **Devas** have the aforementioned six **Udayasthanas**, each with two **Sattaasthanas**, 13 and **Prakrutik**. **Narakas** have only the aforementioned five **Udayasthanas**, but they have only one **Prakrutik** per **Sattaasthanas** because **Jivas** with simultaneous existence of **Tirthankara** and **Aharaka Chatushk** are not born in **Narakas**.

Therefore, each of the **Udayasthanas** from 21 to 30 **Prakrutik** has four **Sattaasthanas**: 63, 12, 86, and 88 **Prakrutik**. The 31st **Prakrutik Udayasthanas** has two **Sattaasthanas**: 62 and 88 **Prakrutik**. Thus, in the **Avirat Samyagdristi Gunasthanas**, there are a total of 30 **Sattaasthanas** in common.

(5) The Desavirat Gunasthan

Now, we consider the Bandha (bond) and other locations of the fifth Desavirat Gunasthan. In the Desavirat Gunasthan, the Bandha and other locations are respectively 'Dug Ch Cha' - two, six, and four. That is, there are two Bandha locations, six Uday locations, and four Sattha locations. Of these, the two Bandha locations are 28 and 29 in nature. The 28th natural Bandha location is for the Tiryanch Panchendriya (five-sensed beings) and humans. It is noteworthy that in this Gunasthan, only the natures capable of attaining Devatva (divine state) are bound, and this location has eight Bhang (divisions). When the Tirthakar nature is included in the aforementioned 28 natures, it becomes the 26th natural Bandha location. This location is for humans because Tiryanch do not have the Tirthakar nature bound. This location also has eight Bhang.

In this Gunasthan, the 25th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, and 31st natural locations are the Uday locations. Of these, the first four Uday locations are for the Tiryanch and humans who are undergoing Vikriya (transformation), and these four Uday locations have one Bhang each for humans. However, the first two Uday locations for Tiryanch have one Bhang each, and the last two Uday locations have two Bhang each.

The 30th natural Uday location is for the Swabhavath (inherent) Tiryanch and humans, as well as the Tiryanch undergoing Vikriya. Here, each of the first two has 144-144 Bhang, which are obtained from the six Sanhanan (compressions), six Sansthan (establishments), Suswar-Duswar (good and bad sounds), and Prashast-Aprashast Vihayogati (good and bad liberation paths) alternatives. The last one has one Bhang. Thus, the 30th natural Uday location has a total of 286 Bhang. Dubhang (double Bhang), Anadeya (unworthy of respect), and Ayash-Kirti (bad reputation) ...

### 335

Uday is not caused by guna-pratyaya alone, therefore the related alternatives are not mentioned here.

### 31

The natural udayasthan is only for the tiryanchas. Here also there are 144 bhangas. Thus, in deshavirat, the total bhangas of all udayasthanas are 10 + 144 + 144 + 144 / 1443 bhangas.

### P

Here there are four sattasthanas which are 93, 92, 86 and natural. Those who become deshavirat by binding the four of tirthankara and aharaka, they have 63 sattas of the natural, and the rest is easy to understand. Thus, in deshavirat, the binding, uday and sattasthanas are explained. There is a debate about the avadha:

If a deshavirat man binds 28 natural, then he has 25, 27, 28, 26 and 30 natural, these five udayasthanas, and in each of them there are 62 and 18 natural, these two sattasthanas. But if a viyancha binds 28 natural, then along with the aforementioned five udayasthanas, there is also a 31 natural udayasthan, making it six udayasthanas, and in each of them there are 62 and natural, these two sattasthanas. 26 natural bandhastan is of a deshavirat man. Therefore, he has the aforementioned 25, 27, 28, 26 and 30 natural, these five udayasthanas, and in each udayasthan there are 63 and 66 natural, these two sattasthanas. Thus, in the deshavirat gunasthan, from the general, there are four sattasthanas in the first five udayasthanas and two in the last udayasthan, making a total of 22 sattasthanas.

The details of the bandha etc. places of the deshavirat gunasthan should be known as follows:

## Sixth Karma Granth

It should be known that all the **Udayasthanas** are present in **Aharakasyata** and **Vaikriyasanyata** beings. However, there is a special feature that 30 **Prakrutik Udayasthanas** are also present in **Svabhavastha** beings. Out of these, there are 25 and 27 **Prakrutik Udayasthanas** for **Vaikriyasanyata** and **Aharakasyata** respectively. Each of these has one **Bhang** and 28 and 26 **Prakrutik Udayasthanas** have two **Bhangs** each. The 30 **Prakrutik Udayasthanas** have one **Bhang** each. Thus, there are a total of 14 **Bhangs** for **Vaikriyasanyata** and **Aharakasyata**.  The 30 **Prakrutik Udayasthanas** of **Svabhavastha** beings also have 144 **Bhangs**. Therefore, the total **Bhangs** for all the **Udayasthanas** of the **Pramattasanyata** **Gunasthanas** are 158.

Here, there are four **Sattaasthanas** - 63, 12, 86, and 88 **Prakrutik**.

After discussing **Bandha**, **Udaya**, and **Sattaasthanas** in the **Pramattasanyata** **Gunasthanas**, we now consider their **Sanvedha**.

In each of the five **Udayasthanas** that bind 28 **Prakrutis**, there are two **Sattaasthanas** - 92 and 88 **Prakrutik**. However, only 62 **Prakrutik Sattaasthanas** are present in **Aharakasyata**, because without the existence of **Aharakachatushk**, **Aharak Samudghata** cannot arise. But, the existence of 62 and 88 **Prakrutis** is possible in **Vaikriyasanyata**. The **Pramattasanyata** who has the existence of **Tirthankara** **Prakruti** does not bind 28 **Prakrutis**. Therefore, the existence of 13 and 89 **Prakrutis** is not present. The five **Udayasthanas** of **Pramattasanyata** who bind 26 **Prakrutis** are possible, and each of them has two **Sattaasthanas** - 63 and 86 **Prakrutik**. Notably, both **Aharakasyata** and **Vaikriyasanyata** have the existence of 63 **Prakrutis**.

Thus, in all the **Udayasthanas** of **Pramattasanyata**, four distinct **Sattaasthanas** are obtained, totaling 20.

The sixth karmagranthya sthana is a place where there are 26 prakritis when the Tirthankara prakriti is included, 30 prakritis when the Tirthankara prakriti is excluded and the Aharakdvig is included, and 31 prakritis when the Tirthavar and Aharakdvig are combined. All these bandha sthana have only one bhang. This is because there is no bandha of asthir, ashubh, and ayash:kiriti for the apramattasanyat.

In the seventh gunasthana, there are two udayasthana, which are 26 and 30 prakritis. The one who has attained the apramattasanyat gunasthana after performing Aharak or Vaikriya samudghata in the previous pramattasanyat state has 26 prakriti udayasthana. Here, there are two bhang, one with respect to Vaikriya and the other with respect to Aharak. There are also two bhang in the 30 prakriti udayasthana, and the 30 prakriti udayasthana is also present in the svabhavath apramattatapat jiva, so there are 144 more bhang with respect to it, making a total of 146. Thus, there are a total of 148 bhang in the two udayasthana of the apramattasanyat gunasthana.

In the Digambar tradition, only one udayasthana of 30 prakritis is mentioned for the apramattasanyat. The reason for this is that there is a consensus in the Digambar tradition that a jiva who performs Aharak samudghata does not attain the seventh gunasthana even after the completion of his svayogya paryapti. Similarly, according to the Digambar tradition, a jiva who performs Vaikriya samudghata does not attain the apramattasanyat gunasthana. Therefore, in Go. Kamankad Ma 501, only one udayasthana of 30 prakritis is established for the apramattasanyat gunasthana. 
- "Two Sayonnishad Yo Naam Purva Pramattasanyat: San Aharak Vaikriyaan Va Nirvartya Paunadpramattamaavan Gachhani Lasma Prapya."
- Saptathika Prakaran Tika, p. 233

One should know the four, four Satta-sthana of the six, sixty-three, sixty-two, eighty-eight types of Janasansanyat Gujasthana. Now we do
The Udayasthana of the binder of twenty-eight Prakruti is both, but the Satta-sthana is only one Prakruti. The Udayasthana of the binder of twenty-six Prakruti is both, but the Satta-sthana is only one Prakruti. The Udayasthana of the binder of thirty Prakruti is also both, but the Satta-sthana is only one ninety-two Prakruti for both, and the Udayasthana of the binder of thirty-one Prakruti is both, but the Satta-sthana is only one ninety-three Prakruti. Here, the Tirthankara or Aharakadvik, whichever has the Satta, binds according to the rule. Therefore, one Satta-sthana is said for each Bandhasthana. Here, there are total Satta-sthana.
Thus, the consideration of the Sanvedha of the Bandha, Udaya and Satta-sthana of the Aprammatasanyat Gunasthana has been done, the description of which is as follows:

(4) Apurvakaran Guna Sthan
In the eighth Apurvakaran Guna Sthan, the Bandha etc. Sthan are as follows: 'Punageg Pau', that is, five Bandha Sthan, one Udaya Sthan and four Satta Sthan. Of these, the five Bandha Sthan are 28, 29, 30, 31 and 1 Prakrutik. Of these, the first four Bandha Sthan should be known as the same as the seventh Aprammatasanyata Guna Sthan, but when the Bandha-Vicched of the Devagati-Prayogya Prakrutis takes place, then only one Yash:ki Ti named Bandha occurs, from which there is also 1 Prakrutik Bandha Sthan here.
Here, the Udaya Sthan is only one 30 Prakrutik. From which there are 24 Bhang due to the alternatives of Vanrishabhanaracha Sanhanan, six Sansthan, Suswar-Duswar and two Vihayogati. But according to some Acharyas, in Apurvakaran, only Vajrarishabhanaracha Sanhanan does not arise in comparison to Upshamani, but one of the first three Sanhanans arises. Therefore, according to them, there are 72 Bhang here. Similarly, 

Page #380:
---------------------------
## The Chapter of Seventy

This should also be understood in the context of Anivrittibada, Sukshmasamparaya, and Upashantamoha Gunasthanas.

Here, the Sattastahans 63, 62, 86, and 88 are the four natural ones. Thus, the binding, arising, and Sattastahans are indicated in Apoovarnakaran. Now, let's consider the Sanvedha.

For beings who bind 28, 29, 30, and 31 Prakrutis, there are 30 Prakrutis of arising, while their Sattastahans are at least 88, 86, 12, and 63 respectively. For a being who binds one Prakruti, there are 30 Prakrutis of arising, and all four Sattastahans are present. This is because, for a being who previously bound 28, 29, 30, or 31 Prakrutis, when the binding and unbinding of Prakrutis worthy of Devagati occurs, there is a binding of one Prakruti. However, the Sattastahans remain in the same order as they were previously bound. In other words, for one who previously bound 20 Prakrutis, the Sattastahan is 88, for one who bound 26, it is 86, for one who bound 30, it is 62, and for one who bound 31, it is 63.

1. Some other Acharyas say that in the Upashma Shreni, there is an arising of one of the three initial Sanhananas. According to their view, the number of Mangas is seventy-two. This should also be understood in the context of Anivrittibada, Sukshmasamparaya, and Upashantamoha.

- Sapttatika Prakaran Tika, p. 233. In the Digambar tradition, this is the only view found. For confirmation, see Go. Karmakanda, verse 269.

"He who is angry, knows only the illusion of Maya, he is happy. Happiness is like iron, it is the cause of destruction."

...Therefore, in a natural bondage state, all four states of existence are obtained.'

**(1-10) Anivritti Vavar, Sukshma Samparaya Gunasthan**

In the ninth and tenth Anivritti Vavar and Sukshma Samparaya Gunasthan, there are 28, 29, 30, and 31 bondage states respectively. Each of these is a single type of bondage state in the context of the Devagati Prayogya Bandha. With 28 days, there are 80 states of existence, and so on. With a single type of bondage, all four are obtained.

**Saptaatika Prakaran Toka, 10.233**

## 4. Pran

There are one Bandha-sthana, one Udaya-sthana, and eight Satta-sthana, as per the 'Aagam Mattha'. Their explanation is as follows:

In the Anivriti-badar Guna-sthana, there is one Bandha-sthana of one Prakriti of Yash-Kirti nature, and one Udaya-sthana of thirty Prakritis. The eight Satta-sthana are of thirteen, ninety-two, eighty-six, fifty-eight, eighty, seventy-six, seventy-six, and seventy-five Prakritis. Out of these, the first four Satta-sthana are in the Upshama श्रेणी, and they remain in the Kshapaka श्रेणी until the thirteen Prakritis of Nama-karma are destroyed. When the thirteen Prakritis of the beings with the above four Satta-sthana are destroyed, they attain the Satta of eighty, seventy-six, seventy-six, and seventy-five Prakritis respectively. This means that when the thirteen Prakritis of the being with thirteen Satta are destroyed, they attain eighty Satta. Similarly, when the thirteen Prakritis of the being with sixty-two Satta are destroyed, they attain seventy-six Satta. When the thirteen Prakritis of the being with seventy-six Satta are destroyed, they attain seventy-six Satta. And when the thirteen Prakritis of the being with seventy-six Satta are destroyed, they attain seventy-five Satta. Thus, one should know these eight Satta-sthana. Here, since there is no difference between Bandha-sthana and Udaya-sthana, meaning both are one, there is no possibility of Samvedha. This means that even though there are eight Satta-sthana, there is no need to mention the relationship separately due to the Bandha-sthana and Udaya-sthana being one.

Similarly, in the Sukshma-Samparaya Guna-sthana, there is one Bandha-sthana of one Prakriti of Kirti form, one Udaya-sthana of thirty Prakritis, and eight Satta-sthana of sixty-three etc. Prakritis as mentioned earlier. Out of these eight Satta-sthana, the first four are in the Upshama श्रेणी, and the remaining four, starting from eighty etc. Prakritis, are in the Kshapaka श्रेणी. The rest should be understood as in the Anivriti-badar Guna-sthana.

Now, we will discuss the Bhangas of the eleven to fourteen Guna-sthana, starting from Upshama-moha, as per 'Chhoumatthakevalijina'.

**(11-12)** In the _Upashantamooh_ and _Bhigamoha_ _Gunasthanas_, there is no _Bandhastan_, but only _Udayasthan_ and _Sattastan_. Therefore, in the _Upashantamooh_ _Gunasthan_, there is one _Udayasthan_ of 30 _Prakrutis_ - 'Eg Chauu' - and four _Sattastans_ of 13, 62, 86, and 88 _Prakrutis_.

In the _Ksheenamoha_ _Gunasthan_, there is also one _Udayasthan_ of 30 _Prakrutis_ and four _Sattastans_ of 80, 79, 76, and 75 _Prakrutis_ - 'Eg Chauu'. Here, there is a special feature in the _Udayasthan_ that if a common being ascends to the _Kshapak_ श्रेणि, then instead of the 72 _Bhangas_ mentioned in other interpretations, only 24 are obtained! Because only one _Vanrishabhanaraach_ संहनन arises. This same thing should be understood in the other previous _Gunasthanas_ of the _Kshapak_. And if a being has the _Satta_ of a _Tirthankar_ प्रकृति, then only his _Prashasht_ _Prakrutis_ arise everywhere, hence only one _Bhang_ is mentioned.

Similarly, there is also some special feature in the _Sattastans_. If a being has the _Satta_ of a _Tirthankar_ प्रकृति, then he has the _Satta_ of 80 and 76, and if another (without the _Satta_ of a _Tirthankar_ प्रकृति) then he has the _Satta_ of 76 and 75 _Prakrutis_. This same thing should be understood everywhere as much as possible.

1.  ..."Only twenty-four _Bhangas_ are possible because of the _Kshapak_ श्रेणि starting with the _Vanrishabhanaraach_ संहनन.
2.  Eighty-one to seventy-five are for the _Atirthankar_ _Satkarma_, and eighty to seventy-six are for the _Tirthankar_ _Satkarma_.

**(13) Soyogikevali Gunasthan**

Soyogikevali Gunasthan has eight Udayasthan and four Sattasthan - 'Attchaou'. The eight Udayasthan are of the 20th, 21st, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, and 31st Prakruti, while the four Sattasthan are of the 80th, 6th, 76th, and 75th Prakruti. Their perception has been discussed earlier, so they should be understood accordingly. For general knowledge, their description is as follows:

**Bandhastan** | **Mang** | **Udayasthan** | **Mang** | **Sattasthan**

Their **samvedha** are as follows: in the **udaya** of 8 **prakritis**, there are three **satta-sthana**: 76, 75, and 8 **prakritis**.

**The Locations of Bondage, etc., in the Paths**

Two, six, eight, and four are the locations of bondage. Five, nine, eleven, and six are the locations of arising. Three, five, eleven, and four are the locations of existence. _[51]_

**Explanation:** Two, six, eight, and four are the locations of bondage in the paths of hell, animal, human, and god, respectively. Five, nine, eleven, and six are the locations of arising, and three, five, eleven, and four are the locations of existence.

**Special Meaning:** This verse indicates the number of locations of bondage, arising, and existence in each path. There are four paths: hell, animal, human, and god. The verse first mentions the number of locations of bondage in each path, following this order: "Two, six, eight, and four." This means that there are two locations of bondage in hell, six in the animal path, eight in the human path, and four in the god path. Then, it mentions the locations of arising: "Five, nine, eleven, and six." This means that there are five locations of arising in hell, nine in the animal path, eleven in the human path, and six in the god path. Finally, it mentions the locations of existence: "Three, five, eleven, and four." This means that there are three locations of existence in hell, five in the animal path, eleven in the human path, and four in the god path.

**Comparison:**

* In the _Karmakanda_ of the _Gommatasara_, there are eleven locations of existence in the human path, while in the _Gommatasara_ _Karmakanda_, there are twelve locations of existence.
* In the _Karmagrantha_, there are six locations of arising in the god path, while in the _Gommatasara_ _Karmakanda_, there are five.

There are some differences between these two texts.

The 30 natural Bandha-sthana (bondage-places) along with the Sapta-tika (seven-fold) chapter and Udyota (illumination) are applicable to the Tiryancha-gati (animal realm). Their dissolution is 4608, and the 30 natural Bandha-sthana along with the Tirthankara name are applicable to the Manushya-gati (human realm). Their dissolution occurs due to the alternatives of stable-unstable, auspicious-inauspicious, fame-infamy.

Now, let us consider the Udaya-sthana (places of arising) in the Naraka (hell) and other realms in sequence. In the Naraka-gati, there are five Udaya-sthana: 21, 25, 27, 28, and 26 natural. In the Tiryancha-gati, there are nine Udaya-sthana: 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31 natural. In the Manushya-gati, there are eleven Udaya-sthana: 20, 21, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 8, and 6 natural. In the Deva-gati (heavenly realm), there are six Udaya-sthana: 21, 25, 27, 28, 26, and 30 natural. Thus, in the four realms of Naraka, Tiryancha, Manushya, and Deva, one should know the five, nine, eleven, and six Udaya-sthana respectively - "Pan nava ekkara chakkaganga udaya".

The Satya-sthana (places of truth) are described in the Naraka and other realms as follows: "Santa ti rancha ekkara chauk". This means that in the Naraka-gati, there are three Satya-sthana: 12, 86, and 18 natural. In the Tiryancha-gati, there are five Satya-sthana: 62, 88, 86, 80, and 78 natural. In the Manushya-gati, there are eleven Satya-sthana: 63, 12, 86, 88, 86, 80, 76, 76, 75, 6, and 8 natural. In the Deva-gati, there are four Satya-sthana: 63, 62, 81, and 88 natural.

Having described the Bandha-sthana, Udaya-sthana, and Satya-sthana of the Naraka, Tiryancha, Manushya, and Deva realms, let us now consider their Samvedha (consciousness) in the sequence of Naraka, Tiryancha, Manushya, and Deva realms.

In the Naraka-gati, those who have bound the 26 natural, which are applicable to the Panchendriya (five-sense) Tiryancha-gati, have five Udaya-sthana: 21, 25, 27, 28, and 26 natural. And in each of these Udaya-sthana, there are two Satya-sthana: 62 and 88 natural. Those who have bound the natural applicable to the Tiryancha-gati do not have the Tirthankara nature bound. 

Page #389:

## Sixth Karma-Sanya

Here, 86 natural Satta-sthana are not mentioned. The five aforementioned Udaya-sthana of the Narakas, who bind the 26 Prakruti applicable to the human path, and in each Udaya-sthana, there are three Satta-sthana: 62, 86, and Prakruti. A human with the Satta of Tirthankara Prakruti, born in Naraka, as long as he remains in Mithyadrishti, due to the binding of 26 Prakruti without his Tirthankara, his Satta becomes a Prakruti Satta-sthana in the 26 Prakruti Bandha-sthana.

In Naraka-gati, 30 Prakruti Bandha-sthana are obtained in two ways: one with Udyotana and the other with Tirthankara Prakruti. The one with 30 Prakruti Bandha-sthana including Udyotana has the same five aforementioned Udaya-sthana, but two Satta-sthana in each Udaya-sthana: 62 and Prakruti. The one with 30 Prakruti Bandha-sthana including Tirthankara Prakruti has only one Prakruti Satta-sthana in each of the five Udaya-sthana.

Thus, in Naraka-gati, there are 40 Satta-sthana in relation to all Bandha-sthana and Udaya-sthana, whose details are as follows:

| Bandha-sthana | Udaya-sthana | Satta-sthana |
|---|---|---|
| 26 Prakruti | 21 | 62, 86, Prakruti |
| Bhang | 27 | 62, 86, Prakruti |
| Mang | 18 | 62, 86, Prakruti |

In the **tiryach-gati**, out of the six **bandha-sthana**, 23 **prakruti** are **bandha-sthana**. Although the aforementioned 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, and 31 **prakruti** are **udaya-sthana**, each of the first four **udaya-sthana** (21, 24, 25, and 26 **prakruti**) has five **satta-sthana** each: 62, 6, 86, 80, and 78 **prakruti**. However, each of the last five **udaya-sthana** has only four **satta-sthana** without 78 **prakruti**. This is because, according to the rule, the existence of **manushya-dvik** is possible in **udaya-sthana** starting from 27 **prakruti**. Therefore, 78 **prakruti** **satta-sthana** is not found in them.

Similarly, one should also know about the beings with 25, 26, 27, and 30 **prakruti** **bandha-sthana**. However, there is a special feature that for beings who have **bandha** of 26 **prakruti**, which is suitable for **manushya-gati**, all their **udaya-sthana** have only four **satta-sthana** without 78 **prakruti**. This is because, for beings who have **bandha** of **manushya-dvik**, 78 **prakruti** **satta-sthana** is not possible.

## Sixth Karma Granthya (35.3)

**The eight Udayasthanas of a being with 28 Prakruti Bandhastanas are:** 21, 25, 26, 27, 25, 26, 30, and 31 Prakruti. 

**The reason why it does not have 24 Prakruti Udayasthanas is because it is only for Ekeendriya beings, and Ekeendriya beings do not have 28 Prakruti Bandhastanas.**

**Of these Udayasthanas:**

* 21, 26, 28, 29, and 30 Prakruti are the five Udayasthanas of Vedak Samyagdrstis with 22 Prakruti of Kshayik Samyagdrsti or Mohaniya. Each of these Udayasthanas has two Sattasthanas, each with 2 Prakruti.
* 25 and 27 Prakruti are the two Udayasthanas of Tiryanch who are capable of Vikriya. Each of these Udayasthanas has two Sattasthanas, each with 62 Prakruti.
* 30 and 31 Prakruti are the two Udayasthanas of Samyagdrsti or Mithyadrsti Tiryanch who have attained all Paryaptis. Each of these Udayasthanas has three Sattasthanas, with 6288 and 6 Prakruti respectively.

**It is important to note that the 86 Prakruti Sattasthanas are only for Mithyadrstis, not Samyagdrstis, because the Bandha of Devadvik is possible for Samyagdrsti Tiryanch according to their rules.**

**Therefore, there are 218 Sattasthanas in total, considering all Bandhastanas and Udayasthanas.**

* Each of the five Bandhastanas (23, 25, 26, 26, and 30 Prakruti) has forty Sattasthanas.
* The 28 Prakruti Bandhastanas have eighteen Sattasthanas.

**Therefore, the total is 40 x 5 + 18 = 218.**

**The details of the relationship between Bandha, Uday, and Sattasthanas of the Karma called "Namakarma" related to Tiryanchgati are as follows:**

## Chapter 356: The Connection of the Seven Tika to Human Destiny

In human destiny, there are 23 **Prakritis** that bind. The **Prakritis** 21, 22, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30 are the seven **Udayasthanas** for a human being. Of these, **Prakritis** 25 and 27 are the two **Udayasthanas** for a **Vikriya** human being. However, the **Aharak** human being does not experience the binding of the 23 **Prakritis**, so they should not be considered here. In these two **Udayasthanas**, there are two **Sattaasthanas** each, with 12 and 88 **Prakritis**. In the remaining five **Udayasthanas**, there are four **Sattaasthanas** each, with 62, 88, 86, and 80 **Prakritis**. Thus, there are 24 **Sattaasthanas** in the 23 **Prakritis** binding place.

Similarly, there should be 24 **Sattaasthanas** each in the 25 and 26 **Prakritis** binding places.

There are also 24 **Sattaasthanas** each in the two **Prakritis** binding places that are applicable to both human and animal destinies.

In the 28 **Prakritis** binding place, there are seven **Udayasthanas**: 21, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30. Of these, **Prakritis** 21 and 26 are the two **Udayasthanas** for a **Samyagdristi** in the state of **Karan-Aparayapta**. **Prakritis** 25 and 27 are the two **Udayasthanas** for a **Vaikriya** or **Aharavasanayat**, and **Prakritis** 28 and 29 are the two **Udayasthanas** for a **Vikriya** who is a **Samyagdristi** without interruption and an **Aharak-Sanayat**. **Prakritis** 30 is the **Udayasthanas** for a **Samyagdristi** or a **Mithyadristi**. In all these **Udayasthanas**, there are two **Sattaasthanas** each, with 12 and 88 **Prakritis**. There is also one **Sattaasthanas** with 62 **Prakritis** for an **Aharak-Sanayat**. However, in the 30 **Prakritis** **Udayasthanas** for the one who binds the 28 **Prakritis** applicable to hellish destiny, there are four **Sattaasthanas** with 12, 86, 88, and 86 **Prakritis**. Thus, there are 16 **Sattaasthanas** in the 28 **Prakritis** binding place. 

Page #395:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karma Granth

**357** There are seven **Udayasthanas** (stages of arising) similar to the 28 **Prakriti** (nature) **Bandhastanas** (stages of bondage) of the one who binds 26 **Prakritis** along with the **Tirthankara** **Prakriti** (nature of a Tirthankara), but with this difference: the 30 **Prakriti** **Udayasthanas** should be said to belong to **Samyagdrstis** (those who have right faith) only, because the 26 **Prakriti** **Bandhastanas** include the **Tirthankara** **Prakriti**, and the bondage of the **Tirthankara** **Prakriti** occurs only for a **Samyagdrsti**. In each of these **Udayasthanas**, there are two **Sattastanas** (stages of existence) of 63 and 89 **Prakritis**. In this, the **Aharak** (food-consuming) **Samyakt** (rightly-conducted) has the existence of 63 **Pravrittis** (tendencies) only. Thus, there are fourteen **Sattastanas** in the 26 **Prakriti** **Bandhastanas** including the **Tirthankara** **Prakriti**.

When the bondage of 30 **Prakritis** occurs, including the **Aharak** **Dwik** (two-fold food-consuming), there are two **Udayasthanas** of 26 and 30 **Prakritis**. Of these, the **Aharak** **Samyakt** who becomes **Aparamatta** **Samyakt** (perfectly-conducted) in the final time after fulfilling his **Swayogya** (self-worthy) **Sarva** **Paryapti** (complete attainment), should be considered to have the arising of 26. Because, elsewhere, in the arising of 26, the specific **Samyama** (restraint) that is the cause of the bondage of the **Aharak** **Dwik** is not found. Therefore, elsewhere, the arising of 30 occurs. So, in each of these **Udayasthanas**, there are 12 **Sattastanas**.

At the time of the 31 **Prakriti** **Bandhastanas**, there is the arising of 30 and the existence of 63. And at the time of the 1 **Prakriti** **Bandhastanas**, there is the arising of 30 and eight **Sattastanas** of 63, 62, 66, 88, 80, 76, 76, and 75 **Prakritis**.

Thus, at the time of the bondage of 23, 25, and 26, there are twenty-four **Sattastanas** each, at the time of the bondage of 28, there are sixteen **Sattastanas**, in the bondage of 26 and 30, which are eligible for **Manushya** **Gati** (human realm) and **Liyach** **Gati** (animal realm), there are twenty-four **Sattastanas** each, in the bondage of 26 along with the **Tirthankara** **Prakriti**, which is eligible for **Dev** **Gati** (heavenly realm), there are fourteen **Sattastanas**, in the bondage of 31, there is one **Sattastanas**, and in the bondage of 1 **Prakriti**, there are eight **Sattastanas**. In this way, there are a total of 156 **Sattastanas** in the **Manushya** **Gati**.

## The Chapter of the Seven Tika

**Deva-Gati (Heavenly Realm):** There are six Udayasthanas (stages of ascent) for the Devas (gods) who bind 25 Prakṛtis (types of karma). Each Udayasthana has two Sattastahanas (states of existence), one with 12 Prakṛtis and the other with 88 Prakṛtis. Similarly, one should know the Udayasthanas for the Devas who bind 26 and 26 Prakṛtis.

**Tiryancha-Gati (Animal Realm):**  There are six Udayasthanas for the Devas who bind 30 Prakṛtis, including those eligible for Tiryancha-Gati, with each Udayasthana having two Sattastahanas, one with 12 Prakṛtis and the other with 88 Prakṛtis.

**Tīrthankara-Gati (Liberated Realm):**  For the Devas who bind 60 Prakṛtis, including the Tīrthankara Prakṛti, there are six Udayasthanas, each with two Sattastahanas, one with 13 Prakṛtis and the other with 16 Prakṛtis.

**Total:** There are a total of 60 Sattastahanas.

**Table:**

## Chapter 362: The Sevenfold

**Samvarsha:** In this context of non-motion, all beings are classified as one-sensory, multi-sensory, and five-sensory (panchendriya). However, within the five-sensory beings, the **bandhastana** (binding places) are eight, five, and five, while the **chhamkekar** (arising places) are five, six, and eleven, and the **saky** (existence places) are twelve, five, and five.

**Gathartha:** In one-sensory, multi-sensory, and five-sensory beings, the binding places are five, five, and eight respectively. The arising places are five, six, and eleven respectively, and the existence places are five, five, and twelve respectively.

**Explanation:** In the previous verse, the binding places, etc., of **namakarma** (name karma) and their corresponding sensations were discussed for the four types of **gatimagna** (those who move). This verse, while discussing the binding places, etc., for the five types of **indriyamargna** (those who move through the senses), explains that the binding places for one-sensory beings are five, for multi-sensory beings are five, and for five-sensory beings are eight. Similarly, the arising places are five for one-sensory beings, six for multi-sensory beings, and eleven for five-sensory beings. The existence places are five for one-sensory beings, five for multi-sensory beings, and twelve for five-sensory beings.

**Detailed Explanation:** There are eight binding places in total. Of these, the binding places for one-sensory beings are 26, 25, 26, 26, and 31, which are five in number. Each of the multi-sensory beings has the same five binding places as the one-sensory beings. The binding places for five-sensory beings are 23, etc., which are eight in number.

There are twelve arising places. Of these, the arising places for one-sensory beings are 21, 24, 25, 26, and 27, which are five in number. The arising places for each of the multi-sensory beings are 21, 26, 28, 26, 30, and 31, which are six in number. 

Page #401:
---------------------------
## The Sixth Karma Granth

There are 363 **Bandha** (bond) places and eleven **Udaya** (arising) places: 20, 21, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 6, and 5 **Prakruti** (nature) for the five senses. There are twelve **Satta** (existence) places in total, of which there are five **Satta** places each for the **Ekendriya** (one-sense) and **Vikalendriya** (impaired-sense) with 12, 88, 86, 80, and 78 **Prakruti** respectively. The five senses have twelve **Satta** places each.

Now, we will discuss the **Sanvedha** (perception) of each **Ekendriya** etc. by explaining their **Bandha**, **Udaya**, and **Satta** places.

The **Ekendriya** with 23 **Prakruti** **Bandha** has five **Satta** places in each of the first four **Udaya** places. The **Udaya** place with 27 **Prakruti** has four **Satta** places except for 78. Similarly, one should know the **Satta** places in relation to the **Udaya** places for the **Bandha** places with 25, 26, 26, and 30 **Prakruti**.

For the **Bandha** place with 23 **Prakruti**, there are 24 **Satta** places in each of the five **Udaya** places, totaling 120. All these **Satta** places belong to the **Ekendriya**.

**In the Vikalendriya-Vikalendriyas, for the beings bound by 23, there are five Udaya-sthans each for the 21st and 26th Prakrutis, and in the remaining four Udaya-sthans, there are four Satta-sthans each, excluding 78. Thus, there are 26 Satta-sthans in the 23 Prakruti Bandha-sthans. Similarly, there are 26 Satta-sthans each in the 25th, 26th, 26th, and 30th Prakruti Bandha-sthans, respectively, in relation to their respective Udaya-sthans. Thus, there are a total of 130 Satta-sthans in the five Bandha-sthans with six Udaya-sthans in the Vikalendriyas.**

## Chapter 7:  The Case of the Seventies

**In the five-sensed and five-indriyal beings, there are six stages of arising (udayasthan) for the 21st, 26th, 28th, 29th, 30th, and 31st natures that bind the 23 natures.**

**These six stages of arising have a total of 26 states of being (sattaasthan).**  The 21st and 26th natures have five states of being each, as previously mentioned. The remaining four stages of arising have four states of being each, excluding the 78th nature.

**For the 25th and 26th natures that bind, there are eight stages of arising for the 21st, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, and 31st natures.**

**Each of the 21st and 26th natures has five states of being, as previously mentioned.** The 25th and 27th natures have two states of being each, the 62nd and 18th. The remaining four stages of arising, the 28th and onwards, have four states of being each, excluding the 78th nature. Thus, each of the 25th and 26th natures has 30 states of being.

**For the 28th nature that binds, there are eight stages of arising for the 21st, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, and 31st natures.**

**These stages of arising should be understood in relation to the five-sensed and human beings, as the 28th nature binds only them.** Each of the six stages of arising from the 21st to the 26th has two states of being, the 12th and 88th natures. The 30th stage of arising has four states of being, the 62nd, 86th, 88th, and 86th natures. The 86th nature should be understood as the state of being of a human who, with a false view (mithyadristi) and the nature of a Tirthankara, binds the 28th nature, making them eligible for hell. The 31st stage of arising has three states of being, the 92nd, 18th, and 86th natures. These three states of being should be understood in relation to the five-sensed non-human beings (tiryanch), as the 31st stage of arising does not occur in other five-sensed beings. The 86th nature is the state of being of a five-sensed non-human with a false view, not a five-sensed non-human with a right view (samyagdristi). This is because, according to the rules for five-sensed non-humans, the binding of the Devadvikas begins. 

Page #405:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karma Granth

**367** Therefore, the existence of their 86 natures is not possible. Thus, in the 28 nature bondage place, there are 16 existence places.

**29** These are the aforementioned eight arising places of those who bind the 29 natures. Among these, in the arising of 21 and 26 natures, there are seven-seven existence places of 12, 88, 16, 80, 78, 63, and 86 natures. Here, the initial two existence places are for those who bind the 26, which are eligible for the animal realm, the initial three for those who bind the 29, which are eligible for the human realm, and the final two for those who bind the 26, which are eligible for the celestial realm. In the arising of 28, 26, and 30, there are six-six existence places without 78. In the arising of 31, there are four initial existence places, and in the arising of 25 and 27, there are four-four existence places of 13, 62, 86, and 88 natures. Thus, in the 26 nature bondage place, there are a total of 44 existence places.

**30** Those who bind the 30 natures have the same eight arising places as those who bind the 26, and the same existence places in each arising place. However, there is this special feature: in the arising of 21, the first five existence places are for those who bind the 30, which are eligible for the animal realm, and the final two existence places are for those who bind the 30, which are eligible for the human realm, and are celestial beings. And in the arising of 26, there are no two existence places of 63 and 86 natures, because the arising of 26 occurs in the insufficient state of animals and humans, but at that time, the binding of the 30, which are eligible for the celestial realm or the human realm, does not occur, so the existence of 63 and 86 is not obtained here. Thus, in the 30 nature bondage place, a total of 42 existence places are obtained.

**31** The arising places and existence places of those who bind the 31 and 1 natures should be known to be the same as those of the human realm.

## The Chapter of the Seven Tika

Thus, one should know the statement of the binding, arising, and being places of name-karma, as well as their stimulations, in relation to the sensory path.  _Now, in the following section, there is an indication of stating the binding, etc., places in the eight _anuyogadwaras_..._

**Verse 53:**

"In the same way as mentioned before, the _kammapagaṭhāṇāī_ (places of the karmic natures) should be known, _suṭhu_ (very well), _bandhuppapasanta_ (with the binding, etc., karmas), through the _gahiāīehi_ (paths of motion, etc., places of destruction), in the _aṭu_ (eight) _anuyogadwaras_ (gates of the _anuyoga_), in _cauppagareṇa_ (four ways).  _Nevāṇi_ (one should know)."

**Meaning:**

These previously mentioned places of the karmic natures related to binding, arising, and being, should be known very well, along with the paths of motion, etc., places of destruction, in the eight _anuyogadwaras_, in four ways.

**Special Note:**

Up to this point in the text, the binding, arising, and being places of the eight _vārmas_ (obscurations), including knowledge-obscuration, have been generally described in terms of the place of the living being, the place of qualities, the path of motion, and the sensory path. However, this verse indicates something specific: just as the paths of motion, etc., have been described previously, they should be understood in relation to the eight _anuyogadwaras_. It also indicates that not only the nature-binding form, but also the "four ways" of knowing, should be understood in relation to the nature-binding, including the form of the state, the section, and the region. This is because binding, arising, and... 

Page #409:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karma Granth
### 371

All karmas are of seven types, classified into four categories based on their nature, state, section, and region.

The text hints at how these four types of karmas are performed and by whom, through the eight *anuyogadwaras* (gates of knowledge) using the *bhasad, gaddha, gati, adhi, ghodah, margana* (means of investigation). The word *margana* means "to investigate." Therefore, *bhargana* refers to those through whom or in whom the investigation of the soul takes place. There are fourteen types of *margana*:

* *Gaviye, pakaye, joaye, veaye, kasaye, mage, sanjam, bansan, leta, bhag, samme, sammi, mamhare* (1. *Gati*, 2. *Indriya*, 3. *Kaya*, 4. *Yoga*, 5. *Ved*, 6. *Kasaya*, 7. *Jnana*, 8. *Sanjam*, 9. *Darshan*, 10. *Leshya*, 11. *Bhavya*, 12. *Samyak*, 13. *Sanjni*, 14. *Ahar*)

These fourteen *margana* have 62 sub-categories.

The tradition of description is to first describe the state of the soul in general and then delve into its specific aspects through the fourteen *margana* within the eight *anuyogadwaras*. *Anuyogadwaras* are synonymous with authority and can be further divided based on the subject matter. However, the detailed discussion of *margana* is primarily found in the eight authorities, hence they are considered the main ones. These eight authorities are:

* *Sant, payaparuvaya, bambammanam, cha, hitasana, ya, kalo, me, antar, bhag, bhav, appa, hun, dhen'* (1. *Aavashyak*, 2. *Niyukti*, 3. *Gatha*, 4. *13*)

##  Chapter 372: The Seven Tika

**1. Sat:** This refers to the existence of the desired Dharma (virtue) in different paths (marganas).

**2. Sankhya:** This refers to the number of beings possessing the desired Dharma.

**3. Kshetra:** This refers to the current dwelling place of beings possessing the desired Dharma.

**4. Sparshan:** This refers to the totality of all the realms that beings possessing the desired Dharma have touched, are touching, and will touch.

**5. Kal:** This refers to the lowest and highest states of beings possessing the desired Dharma.

**6. Antar:** This refers to the interruption or hindrance of the desired Dharma. It explains how long the interruption lasts in different paths or generally.

**7. Bhava:** This refers to the nature of the desired Dharma.

**8. Alpbahutva:** This refers to the degree of the desired Dharma.

_Although the verse only mentions that the eight types of karma (Bandha, Uday, Satya, and their sub-categories) should be discussed in the eight Anuyo-gadwaras through the paths of Prakriti, Sthiti, Anubhag, and Pradesh, as explained earlier, the commentator Acharya Malayagiri states that the Sat Anuyo-gadwara of the eight karmas has already been discussed generally in the Gunasthanas. The remaining seven Anuyo-gadwaras (Sankhya, etc.) should be explained by referring to the texts on Karma-Prakriti and Prabhutva. However, these texts are not available in the present time, so the explanation of these Anuyo-gadwaras..._

### 373

It is difficult to explain the doors. Yet, those who are wise and have a clear understanding should explain them by observing the relationship between the past and the present.

The commentary by Acharya Shri makes it clear that the texts which elaborate on the subject mentioned in the verse are not available today. Nevertheless, with the help of various texts, one should understand the details of the binding, arising, and existence locations of the eight karmas in their original and subsequent natures, as described in the Marganas.

First, we will discuss the binding, etc., locations of the six karmas: Jnanavarana, Darshanavarana, Vedaniya, Ayu, Gotra, and Antaraya. After that, we will explain the binding, etc., locations of the Mohaniya and Nama karma.

The details of the binding, etc., locations of the six karmas, Jnanavarana, etc., in the Marganas are as follows:

| **Order** | **Margana Name** | **Original Nature** | **Subsequent Nature** | **Binding** | **Arising** | **Existence** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Jnanavarana |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2 | Darshanavarana |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3 | Vedaniya |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4 | Ayu |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5 | Gotra |  |  |  |  |  |
| 6 | Antaraya |  |  |  |  |  |

**Binding:**

* Hell realm
* Animal realm
* Human realm
* God realm
* One-sense being
* Two-sense being
* Three-sense being
* Four-sense being
* Five-sense being
* Earth body
* Water body
* Fire body
* Air body

**Arising:**

##  Chapter 70: Word Meanings

**Bayassa:** Age, **Udaya:** Arising, **Udorana:**  Stimulation, **Samisao:** Ownership, **Ma:** There is not, **Viseto:**  Speciality, **Soon:**  Horse, **4:** And, **Pal:** Forty-one, **Prakriti:**  Natures, **Sesarva:**  Remaining, **Sambapai:**  All Natures.

**Gatha:**  Except for the forty-one natures, there is no speciality in the ownership of the arising and stimulation of the remaining natures.

**Kosa:**  In the G section, the perception of all these with the Udayan and Sapta-sthana has been considered. But due to the similarity in arising and stimulation, the reason for not considering it has been explained in this Gatha. It states that although there is no difference in arising and stimulation, there is a speciality in that the arising and stimulation of the forty-one Karma Natures are different. Therefore, out of the 122 natures that are capable of arising, one should know that the arising and stimulation of the remaining 81 natures, excluding the 41 natures, are the same.

**Explanation:** The characteristics of arising and stimulation are as follows: The experience of the Karma atoms that have been obtained in this time is called arising. And bringing the Karma atoms that are situated outside the arising stream, with or without the Kshaya, by the special power of the Yoga-sanjna, into the arising stream and experiencing them with the Karma atoms that have been obtained in the arising is called stimulation. In this way, the experience of the Karma atoms...

**1.**  The experience of the atoms obtained in this time is called arising. The experience of the atoms not obtained in this time, situated outside the arising stream, with or without Kshaya, by the special power of the Yoga-sanjna, brought into the arising stream, along with the Karma atoms obtained in the arising, is called stimulation.

**Chapter 70 Commentary, Page 242** 

Page #415:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karma Granth

377. Uday and Udirana are similar. However, there is a difference in the experience of Kalaprapta and Akalaprapta karma particles. That is, in Uday, Kalaprapta karma particles remain, and in Udirana, Akalaprapta karma particles remain. Still, the general rule is that where there is Uday of a karma, there is definitely Udirana of that karma.

But there are seven exceptions to this. These exceptions should be known:

1. Those whose Uday leads to the destruction of their Satva, their Udirana-vichched happens one Avali-kal earlier, and their Uday-vichched happens one Avali-kal later.
2. The Udirana of Vedaniya and Manushyayu happens only until the sixth Prabhat-samyata Gunasthan, while their Uday happens until the Ayogikevali Gunasthan.
3. Those whose nature has Uday in the Ayogikevali Gunasthan, their Udirana happens only until the Sayogikevali Gunasthan.
4. The four Ayukamas have only Uday in the last Avali of their respective Bhava, not Udirana.
5. The five, Nidraadi, have only Uday after Sharira-paryapti until Indriya-paryapti is complete, not Udirana.
6. After Antar-karan, when one Avali-kal remains in the Prathama-sthiiti, there is only Uday of Mithyatva, of Samyaktva for one who attains Kshayik Samyaktva, and of the Veda whose Uday caused the ascent to the Upshama-shreni, not Udirana.

-

-

1. Just as there is Uday, there is Udirana, and just as there is Udirana, there is Uday.

## Chapter 37: 

**Verse 7:** Even in the subtle realm of the *Upashamashreni* (stage of diminishing karma), where the *Gunasthanas* (stages of spiritual progress) are subtle, the subtle greed arises only when there is a residue of *Aavalikala* (past karma). It does not arise due to *Udirana* (external stimulation). 

There are 41 such *Prakritis* (karmic tendencies) with the aforementioned seven exceptions. The text does not mention any specific characteristics regarding the *Swamitva* (ownership) of the remaining *Prakritis* (excluding these 41) in their arising and *Udirana*.

The following verse describes these 41 *Prakritis* that have specific characteristics in their arising and *Udirana*.

**Verse 5:** 
*Naanataraayavasagam basananav beyanija miichhat, sammat lobha veyaa'aaugaani navaanaam us cha.*

**Meaning:** 
*Naanataraayavasagam* - Ten *Prakritis* of *Jnanaavaran* (knowledge obscuring karma) and *Antaraay* (hindrance karma), 
*Basananav* - Nine *Prakritis* of *Darshanaavaran* (perception obscuring karma), 
*Beyanija* - Two *Prakritis* of *Vedaniya* (karmic fruits), 
*Miichhat* - *Mithyatva* (false belief), 
*Sammat* - *Samyaktava* (right belief), 
*Lobha* - *Sanjvalana Lobha* (burning greed), 
*Veyaa'aaugaani* - Three *Vedas* (knowledge) and four *Aayu* (life spans), 
*Navaanaam* - Nine *Prakritis* of *Namakarma* (name karma),

**Verse:** 
*Jnanaavaran* and *Antaraay* karma, totaling ten, nine *Darshanaavaran*, two *Vedaniya*, *Mithyatva*, *Samyaktava*, *Sanjvalana Lobha*, three *Vedas*, four *Aayu*, nine *Namakarma*, and *Uchcha* *Upgotr* - these are the forty-one *Prakritis* that have specific characteristics in their arising and *Udirana*.

**Explanation:** 
The text mentions that there are forty-one *Prakritis* that have specific characteristics regarding *Swamitva* in their arising and *Udirana*. These forty-one *Prakritis* are as follows: 
* Five *Jnanaavaran* starting with *Matijnanaavaran*, 
* Five *Antaraay* starting with *Daanaantaray*, and 
* Nine *Darshanaavaran* starting with...

## The Karma Granth (Chapter)

**376** The four karmas, Darshanavarana, etc., totaling fourteen in number, experience both *udaya* (arising) and *udirana* (manifestation) equally until one *avali* (unit of time) remains in the twelfth *kshinamoha* (diminished delusion) *gunasthan* (spiritual stage). However, when one *avali* remains, only *udaya* occurs for these fourteen karmas, but their *udirana* does not occur due to the unsuitability of all the causes related to the *karmadalik* (karma-related) *udaya* (arising).

After the completion of *shariraparayapti* (physical perfection) for those beings who have attained *parayapti* (perfection), from the time of the completion of *shariraparayapti* until the completion of *indriyaparayapti* (perfection of senses), only *udaya* occurs for the five karmas, *nidra* (sleep), etc., remaining from *darshanavarana*, but not *udirana*. Additionally, during the remaining time, their *udaya* and *udirana* occur simultaneously, and their *vichched* (disintegration) also occurs simultaneously.

The *udaya* and *udirana* of *sata* (pleasant) and *asata* (unpleasant) *vedaniya* (karmas) occur simultaneously until the *pramattasanyata* (delusion-bound) *gunasthan*, but in the subsequent *gunasthanas*, only their *udaya* occurs, not *udirana*.

After the *antarakaran* (inner transformation) of the being who first generates *samyaktv* (right faith), when one *avali* remains in the *prathama sthiti* (first state), only *udaya* occurs for *mithyatva* (false belief), not *udirana*. The *vedak* (knower) *samyagdristi* (right-seeing) being who generates *kshayik* (destructive) *samyaktv* has destroyed *mithyatva* and *samyagmithyatva* (mixed belief) and, through the complete destruction of *samyaktv*, has attained *apardhatana* (partial liberation) and maintained the *antarmuhurt* (momentary) state for the remaining time. After that, *udaya* and 
 
**(1)** In the Digambara tradition, *nidra* (sleep) and *prachala* (restlessness) are said to experience both *udaya* and *vichched* simultaneously in the *kshinamoha* *gunasthan*. Therefore, in this context, the *uvamgat* (subordinate) karma whose *upayamyunchhiti* (subordinate manifestation) and *satyavyujiyakti* (true manifestation) occur simultaneously will experience *udiranavyuchchhiti* (manifestation of manifestation) one *avali* before *udayavyuchchhiti* (manifestation of arising).

Chapter of the Seven

When a single *avali* remains, the arising of *samyaktvam* occurs due to *udirana*, but *udirana* itself does not occur. The arising of *sajvalan* and *lobha* occur simultaneously with *udirana*. When the time of *sukshmasampray* remains for one *avani*, the arising of *lobha* occurs only in the time of *avali*, not *udirana*.  _From the three Vedas, the one by which the being ascends the *jīva* ladder, after its *antarakaran*, the arising occurs when one *avali* measure of time remains in the first state of that Veda, but *udirana* does not occur. In all four *āyus*, the arising occurs when one *avali* measure of time remains in the final *avali* of their respective births, but *udirana* does not occur. However, the human *āyu* has a special characteristic: the arising occurs after the *pramattasanyata* *gunasthan*, but *udirana* does not occur._  _The human path, the five-sense beings, *bas*, *badar*, *paryāpta*, *subhaga*, *ādeya*, *yashkīti*, and *tīrthankara* are the nine natures of *nāmakarma*, and the *uchchagotra*. These ten natures are capable of both arising and *udirana* up to the *sayogikebali* *gunasthan*, but in the *ayogikebali* *gunasthan*, only arising occurs, not *udirana*.

**Sixth Karma Granthya**

In the previous verse, the characteristics of the forty-one natures were described in relation to their arising and stimulation. In this verse, the names of those forty-one natures are explained along with the reason why they do not experience stimulation. In the following verses, the binding of the natures in the Gunasthanas will be explained.

**Binding of Natures in Gunasthanas**

**Verse 56:**

**Tiththagaraaharagavirahiyao ajjeï savvapgaïyo. Micchhataveyago sasano vi iguvhiseseo.**

**Meaning:**

**Tiththagaraaharag:** Tirthankara name and Aharakaddvik, **virahiyao:** without, **ajjeï:** acquired, binds, **savvapgaïyo:** all natures. **Micchhataveyago:** Mithyatva, **sasano:** Sasadan Gunasthana, **vi:** without, **iguvhiseseo:** nineteen, remaining.

**Verse Meaning:**

Mithyatva binds all natures except the Tirthankara name and Aharakaddvik. The Sasadan Gunasthana binds all natures except nineteen.

**Detailed Meaning:**

There are fourteen Gunasthanas: Mithyatva, Sasadan, etc. and 148 natures of the eight root karmas: Jnanavarana, etc. Out of these, 120 natures are considered bindable. The consideration of 120 bindable natures does not mean that the remaining 28 natures are disregarded. The reason is that the five Bandhanas and five Sanghatanas, these ten natures are inseparable from the body. Therefore, wherever there is binding of the body, there is also binding of these Bandhanas and Sanghatanas. Hence, these ten natures are not counted separately. 

Page #420:
---------------------------
## Chapter 32: The Bond of the False

It is said that there are 148 **Prakritis** (fundamental principles). Out of these, 10 **Prakritis** are excluded, leaving 138 **Prakritis**. There are 20 sub-categories within the four **Varna** (colors), but for the purpose of understanding **Bandha** (bondage), we consider only the four fundamental **Prakritis** of **Varna**, **Gandha** (smell), **Rasa** (taste), and **Sparsha** (touch). Therefore, subtracting 20-4=16 from 130, we are left with 122 **Prakritis**.

**Darshan** (perception) is categorized into three **Prakritis**: **Samyak** (right), **Samyagmithyatva** (partially right), and **Mithyatva** (false). Out of these, **Samyak** and **Samyagmithyatva** are not **Bandha** **Prakritis**. This is because **Bandha** occurs due to the **Mithyatva** **Prakriti**, and the **Jiva** (soul) through its **Samyak** quality divides the **Mithyatva** into three parts. The most pure part is called **Samyak**, the less pure part is called **Samyagmithyatva**, and the remaining impure part is called **Mithyatva**. Therefore, subtracting **Samyak** and **Samyagmithyatva** from 122, we are left with 120 **Prakritis** that are considered **Bandhayoga** (capable of being bound).

This verse begins the discussion of how many **Prakritis** are bound in each **Gunasthan** (stage of virtue).

To explain the **Bandhayoga** **Prakritis** in the first **Mithyatva** **Gunasthan**, the verse states that except for the three **Prakritis** of **Tirthankaranam** (the name of the Tirthankara), **Aharakdvig** (the two-fold food), and **Aharak** **Sharir** (the body that consumes food) and **Aharak** **Angopanga** (the limbs and organs that consume food), the remaining 117 **Prakritis** are bound. The reason for these three **Prakritis** not being bound is that **Tirthankaranam** is bound in the presence of **Samyak** quality, and **Aharakdvig** is bound in the presence of **Samyama** (self-control). However, in the first **Mithyatva** **Gunasthan**, there is neither **Samyak** nor **Samyama**. Therefore, in the **Mithyatva** **Gunasthan**, these three **Prakritis** are not bound, and the remaining 117 **Prakritis** are bound. 

Page #421:
---------------------------
## The Sixty Karmas Text

**Sāsadan Guṇasthān:** In the Sāsadan Guṇasthān, there is bondage of 101 Prakṛtis, excluding the 19 Prakṛtis that are 'Sāsano Vi Iguvīs Sesāo'. This means that the 16 Prakṛtis that are bound due to the Mithyātvā Guṇa are not bound in the Sāsadan Guṇasthān because Mithyātvā is absent there. The names of these 16 Prakṛtis bound due to Mithyātvā are:

1. Mithyātvā
2. Napuṃsakaved
3. Narakagati
4. Narakānupūrvī
5. Narakāyu
6. Ekeṇdriya Jāti
7. Dvīndriya Jāti
8. Trīndriya Jāti
9. Caturindriya Jāti
10. Huṇḍasamsthān
11. Sevāt Sanhanan
12. Ātap
13. Sthāvar
14. Sūkṣma
15. Sādharan
16. Aparyāpt

Out of the 117 Prakṛtis bound by Mithyātvā, when these 16 Prakṛtis are subtracted, there are 101 Prakṛtis bound in the Sāsadan Guṇasthān.

Thus, after explaining the Prakṛtis that are subject to bondage in the first and second Guṇasthāns - Mithyātvā and Sāsadan - the following verse explains the number of Prakṛtis that are subject to bondage in the third, fourth, and subsequent Guṇasthāns.

**Verse 57:**

"Chāyālases Mosō Aviryāsammo Tiyālapariseṣā | Sevṇṇ Desaviro Viro Sagvaṇṇaseṣāo ||57||"

**Explanation:**

* In the Gāpā-miśra Guṇasthān, there are remaining Prakṛtis excluding 36 (Chāyālases).
* In the Avirat Samyagdṛṣṭi Guṇasthān, there are remaining Prakṛtis excluding 43 (Tiyālapariseṣā).
* In the Deśavirat Guṇasthān, there are remaining Prakṛtis excluding 45 (Sevṇṇ).
* In the Viro Guṇasthān, there are remaining Prakṛtis excluding 49 (Sagvaṇṇaseṣāo).

## Chapter of the Seven Tika

In the state of **Pramattavirata**, the remaining **Prakritis** (principles) bind without the **Sattavan** (seven).

**Explanation:**

The previous verse explained the **Prakritis** that are capable of binding in the first and second **Gunasthanas** (states of qualities). This verse describes the binding process of the **Prakritis** in the remaining four **Gunasthanas** - **Misra**, **Sadharana**, **Uddharana**, and **Uddharana**. The details of **Shiva** are as follows:

In the third **Misra Gunasthan**, out of the 120 **Prakritis** capable of binding, 46 are subtracted, leaving 74 **Prakritis** that bind. This is because the **Anantanubandhi** (infinitely connected) arises until the second **Sasadan Gunasthan**. However, the **Anantanubandhi** does not arise in the third **Misra Gunasthan**. Therefore, the 25 **Prakritis** that bind due to the arising of the **Anantanubandhi** do not bind here. In other words, in the third **Misra Gunasthan**, 25 **Prakritis** are further subtracted from the 101 **Prakritis** capable of binding in the **Sasadan Gunasthan**. These 25 **Prakritis** are:

* **Styanaddhitrik** (three types of dullness)
* **Anantanubandhi Chatushk** (four types of infinitely connected)
* **Strived** (female knowledge)
* **Tiyanchgaati** (animal path)
* **Tichannupurvi** (previous animal path)
* **Tiyanchaayu** (animal lifespan)
* Four **Sansthanas** (abodes) in the middle, excluding the first and last
* Four **Sanhananas** (concentrations) in the middle, excluding the first and last
* **Udyot** (brightness)
* **Aprashasht Vihayogati** (unrefined liberation path)
* **Dubhang** (deformed)
* **Duhswar** (harsh voice)
* **Anadeya** (unworthy of respect)
* **Nich Gotra** (low lineage)

Additionally, there is a rule that no lifespan binds in the **Misra Gunasthan**. Therefore, **Manushyaayu** (human lifespan) and **Devaayu** (divine lifespan), these two lifespans are also reduced. The reason for reducing these two lifespans is that the binding-release of **Narakaayu** (hell lifespan) occurs in the first **Gunasthan**, and the binding-release of **Ticha** (animal lifespan) occurs in the second **Gunasthan**. Therefore, out of the four types of lifespan karma, the remaining two **Prakritis**, **Manushyaayu** and **Devaayu**, are reduced here. Thus, **Sasa** - 

Page #423:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karma Prabhtha

In the second Gunasthan, there are 19 non-binding Prakruti. When we add these 19 to the 25+2=27 Prakruti, we get 46 Prakruti that are not bound in the mixed Gunasthan. However, out of the 120 Prakruti, 74 Prakruti are bound, excluding the 46.

In the fourth Aviral Samyagdrishti Gunasthan, 77 Prakruti are bound, excluding 43 Prakruti - "Aviryasammo Tialparisa". This is because the Aviral Samyagdrishti Jiva can be bound by the three Prakruti of Manushyayu, Vayu, and Tirthankar name. Therefore, instead of subtracting 46 Prakruti from the 120 bound Prakruti, only 43 are subtracted. Thus, 77 Prakruti are bound in the Aviral Samyagdrishti Gunasthan.

In the fifth Deshavirat Gunasthan, 67 Prakruti are bound, excluding 53 - "Tevaran Deshaviro". This means that the ten Prakruti that are bound in the Aviral Samyagdrishti Jiva due to the rise of Apratyasthanaavaran Kshaya are not bound here because the Apratyasthanaavaran Kshaya does not arise. Therefore, adding the 10 Prakruti to the 43 Prakruti subtracted in the previous Gunasthan, we get 53 Prakruti that are not bound in the Deshavirat Gunasthan. The remaining 67 Prakruti are bound.

The names of the 10 Prakruti that are bound due to the rise of Apratyakhyanaavaran Kshaya are: Apratyakhyanaavaran Krodha, Mana, Maya, Lobha, Manushygati, Manushyanupurvi Manushyayu, Audarik Sharira, Mauvarik Angopaang, and Banaraach Sanhanan.

In the Shramatavirata Gunasthan, 63 Prakruti are bound, excluding 57. This means that... 

Page #424:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**Chapter 386**

The fourfold aversion (anger, pride, deceit, greed) binds up to the *Dehavirat* (body-free) *Gunasthan* (state of being). They do not bind in the *Pramattavirat* (distracted-free) *Gunasthan*. Therefore, the 53 *Prakritis* (principles) that are declared unfit to bind in the *Deshavirat* (territory-free) *Gunasthan*, when added to these four *Prakritis*, become 57 *Prakritis* unfit to bind in the *Pramattavirat* *Gunasthan* - "Vir-o Sagvannasesa-o". Therefore, 63 *Prakritis* bind in the *Pramattavirat* *Gunasthan*.

Now, the following verse indicates the number of *Prakritis* that bind in the seventh and eighth *Gunasthan*.

**Verse 5:**

"Igusditham-appamaso bandhai devajyass iyar-o vi. Atthavannam-purukho chhappannam va chi chhavi-san."

**Meaning:**

*Igusditham* - 69 *Prakritis*, *Appamatto* - non-distracted, *Sampat* - wealth, *Dhar* - religion, *Bansh* - lineage, *Vauyass* - Devayus, *Iyar-o vi* - also non-distracted, *Atthavannam* - 48, *Apughdo* - *Apuvrakaran* *Gunasthan*, *Chhappannam* - 56, *Ka vi* - or also, *Chhavi-san* - 36.

**Verse Meaning:**

The being residing in the *Aparamattasanyat* (non-distracted-controlled) *Gunasthan* binds 69 *Prakritis*. This also binds Devayus. The being residing in the *Apuvrakaran* *Gunasthan* binds 48, 56, or 36 *Prakritis*.

**Special Meaning:**

This verse indicates the number of *Prakritis* that can bind in the seventh (*Aparamattasanyat*) and eighth (*Apuvrakaran*) *Gunasthan*. However, the style of this verse is different from the previous verses. In the previous verses, the main focus was on how many *Prakritis* do not bind in a particular *Gunasthan*, and the binding *Prakritis* were mentioned accordingly. But, from this verse onwards, the order is changed, and it is mentioned how many *Prakritis* bind in a particular *Gunasthan*. 

Page #425:
---------------------------
K! It is a part. Therefore, now, according to Papa's indication, the number of Akalis bound in Gunadanas is directed. _ In the seventh Lapanavirat Gunasthan, there are sixty-nine Prakruti bound - 'Marisaramanalo'. It has been told before that in the Pramattachintat Gunasthan, sixty-three Prakrutis are bound, out of which Asalavedaniya, Arati, Shok, Asthir, Ashubh and Ayash-Kiti, these six Prakrutis are not bound in the seventh Gunasthan, they are bound till the sixth Gunasthan. Therefore, after reducing these six Prakrutis from the aforementioned sixty-three Prakrutis, fifty-seven Prakrutis remain, but in this Gunasthan, Aharakaddhik is bound, due to which two Prakrutis are added to fifty-seven, making it fifty-six Prakrutis of Apratmatasanyat bound.
In the said Prakrutis, Devayu is also included, but in the darkness, Apratmatasangat Devayu is also bound... 'Bandhai Devalayass Ithar Ni-Ra' is indicated by the type of Shaka. Its meaning is that the beginning of the association of Devayu with Kadayu is only Samatapat, yet it also becomes Apratmatasanyat while taking the blessing of Laya, and in this way, Asamatapat also becomes the bound of Devayu. But from this, it should not be understood that Apratmatasanyat is also the beginning of the binding of Devayu. Apratmatasampat is the beginning of the binding of Devayu. If this meaning is taken, then it is not appropriate to think so. To clarify this point, the author has indicated 'Apratmatasanyat also binds Devayu'. - . .-.- -. .. . १ Tenaitat Sucyate Pramattasanyat Shavayurvandham Pradhabat Sarabhase, Aaraby Va

---------------------------
The chapter on Sapta-tika, named A-purva-karan, has 88, 44 and 21 types of prati-kriyas in the Puny-sthana. The prati-kriyas are differentiated in the institution due to the loss of the power of the Roman in the Mahat-purn-kanig. The A-purva-karan guna-sthana bala-jipa first binds 5 prati-kriyas in the first part of the institution. Subsequently, due to the increase of Nima and Praghala, it binds 56 prati-kriyas until the remaining part of the institution is left. After that, it binds 21 prati-kriyas in the final part, after the binding of these 30 prati-kriyas: Dev-gati, Deva-anupurvi, Papani-jati, Kriya-karira, Hiya-ango-pang, Aharak-sharira, Baharak-ango-pang, Tejas-sharira, Karman-sharira, Sama-chatur-sra-sansthan, Pane-pasushk, Aguru-la, Upamat, Para-pat, Upvas, Prashast-biha-yogati, Bas, Paver, Paryapt, Pratyek, Hiper, Shubh, Subhag, Susbar, A-dey, Nirman and Siker. This is indicated in the Gatha by the instruction: "Adva-balam-pumuyo chhappannam par vi ghanise."

Thus, the number of Medha-prati-kriyas up to the eighth Puny-sthana has been stated. Now, in the next Gatha, the number of Medha-prati-kriyas in the remaining six guna-sthana is explained.

"Babisa a-purna bandha adar-sant-mani-yat-ti. Sattar mutu-masara-go sabam-moho sabogi ti ||6||"

##  Translation:

**Verse:**

The **Anivritti** stage binds eighteen **Prakritis** (principles), starting with twenty-two and decreasing one by one. The **Sukshmarupa** stage binds all the **Prakritis** together. The **Upshanshi** and **Kevali** stages, with their **Gunasthanas**, bind only seven **Prakritis**.

**Commentary:**

The first part of the **Anivritti** stage binds twenty-two **Prakritis**. This is because, although the eighth **Apuurvakarana Gunasthan** binds twenty-six **Prakritis**, the last moment of this stage sees the detachment of four **Prakritis** - **Hasya** (laughter), **Rati** (love), **Bharat** (attachment), and **Jugupsa** (aversion). Therefore, the first moment of the ninth **Gunasthan** binds twenty-two **Prakritis**.

Subsequently, at the end of the first part, **Purushamev** detaches, followed by **Sanjwalan Krodha** at the end of the second part, **Sanjwalan Mana** at the end of the third part, and **Sanchalan Maya** at the end of the fourth part. This leads to the binding of eighteen **Prakritis** in the fifth part.

Therefore, the **Anivritti** stage has five parts, with twenty-two **Prakritis** bound initially. Then, at the end of each part, one **Prakriti** detaches, resulting in the binding of twenty-one, twenty, nineteen, and eighteen **Prakritis** respectively. The verse highlights this: "Twenty-two, one less, binding eighteen, the remaining."

However, when **Sanjwalan Lobha** detaches at the end of the fifth part of the **Anivritti** stage, the tenth **Sukshmasampray Gunasthan** binds seventeen **Prakritis**: "Seventeen, the **Sukshmasampray**." 

Page #428:
---------------------------
## Chapter on the Sevenfold (Sapta-tika)

At the end of the tenth **guna-sthana**, the following sixteen **prakritis** are liberated: five **jnana-avaranas**, four **darsana-avaranas**, five **antarayas**, **yasha-kiriti**, and **uchcha-gotra**. This means that by the tenth **guna-sthana**, the **mohaniya-karma** is either subdued or destroyed, leading to the state of **amoha**.  Therefore, beings in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth **guna-sthana** - **upshanta-moha**, **kshina-moha**, and **sayogi-kevali** - are free from **mohaniya-karma** and only experience the binding of one **satavedaniya-karma**: "**sayam-moho sogi ni**".

At the end of the **sayogi-kevali** **guna-sthana**, the binding of **satavedaniya-karma** is also liberated.  Therefore, in the fourteenth **ayogi-kevali** **guna-sthana**, there are no causes for binding, and thus no binding occurs.  In other words, the fourteenth **guna-sthana** is free from **karma-bandha**.

Although the verse does not explicitly mention the **ayogi-kevali** **guna-sthana**, it states that the binding of one **satavedaniya-karma** occurs for **moha-free** and **sayogi-kevali** beings.  From this, we can infer that in the **ayogi-kevali** **guna-sthana**, the main causes of binding - **kashya** and **yoga** - are absent.  Since the cause is absent, the effect cannot occur.  Therefore, in the **ayogi-kevali** **guna-sthana**, there is no binding of **karma**, even in the slightest amount.

In this way, we have considered which **prakritis** are bound and which are not bound in each **guna-sthana** across four verses.  A brief summary of this is as follows:

The chapter on Sapta-tika explains the number of natures that are bound and unbound in each Gunasthana, along with their names. This information is specifically mentioned in the second Karmagrantha. Therefore, inquisitive individuals should refer to it.

While concluding the discussion on Apaswamitva in Gunasthanas, the text also mentions the concept of Bandhaswamitva in Margans, stating: "As the binding of the Moksha is described, so too is the binding of the Swamitva." (60)

This refers to the binding and unbinding of the aforementioned Gunasthanas, and the knowledge of Swamitva. In Margans like Gati, etc., the binding of various tendencies occurs. Therefore, one should understand the concept of Bandhaswamitva in Margans in the same way as Moksha.

**Explanation:**

The previous verses discussed the binding and unbinding of natures in each Gunasthana. This establishes the concept of Samampasama Swamisam. However, it remains unclear how many natures are bound and unbound in Margans like Gati, etc. This verse clarifies that one should consider the number of natures bound in each Margan and apply the same understanding of Swamitva as in Moksha. 

Page #431:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karma Granth
### 363

Although it is necessary to consider the concept of *bandhasvamitva* (ownership of karma) in the context of *marganas* (paths) according to the aforementioned indication, it has been discussed in detail in the third Karma Granth. Therefore, the inquisitive should refer to it. 

Now, the following verse describes the presence of different *prakritis* (natures) in different *gatis* (paths):

**"Tistagardevanaaryayugam cha tisuthisu gaisu badhgawam | Avsesa payadio havanti samasu vi gaisu ||61||"**

**Explanation:**

* **Tistagardevanaaryayugam:**  This refers to the *Tithankar* (liberated soul), *Devaayu* (divine beings), and *Naraayu* (human beings).
* **Tisuthisu gaisu:**  These three *prakritis* exist in three *gatis* each.
* **Badhgawam:**  It is understood that they are bound by karma.
* **Avsesa payadio:**  The remaining *prakritis* (other than the three mentioned above).
* **Havanti samasu vi gaisu:**  They exist in all *gatis*.

**Meaning:**

The *Tithankar*, *Devaayu*, and *Naraayu* exist in three *gatis* each. All other *prakritis* exist in all *gatis*.

**Detailed Explanation:**

This verse indicates that the *Tithankar*, *Devaayu*, and *Naraayu* exist in three *gatis* each. For example, the *Tithankar* *namakarma* (karma of name) exists in the *naraka* (hell), *deva* (heaven), and *manushya* (human) *gatis*. However, it does not exist in the *tiryanch* (animal) *gati*. This is because the *Tithankar* *namakarma* is not born in the *tiryanch* *gati*, and there is no binding of the *Tithankar* *namakarma* in the *tiryanch* *gati*. Therefore, the *Tithankar* *prakriti* exists only in the *naraka*, *deva*, and *manushya* *gatis*.

Similarly, the *Devaayu* exists in the *tiryanch*, *manushya*, and *deva* *gatis*. This is because there is no rule for the binding of *Devaayu* karma in the *naraka* *gati*.

In the same way, the Tiryanch, human, and hell realms have the existence of the hell-life, but not the heaven realm, because the binding of the hell-life for the gods is not possible.

Except for the above mentioned natures, the existence of all other natures is found in all four realms. The meaning is that the binding of the heaven-life occurs both before and after the binding of the Tirthankara nature, but regarding the hell-life, the rule is that a human who has bound the hell-life can also bind the Tirthankara nature after becoming a Samyagdarshi. Similarly, a being with the existence of the Tirthankara nature - both god and hell - only binds the human life, not the Tiryanch life. This is the rule. Therefore, the existence of the Tirthankara nature is found in the remaining three realms, excluding the Tiryanch realm.

Similarly, there is a rule that the hell being does not bind the heaven-life, and the god does not bind the hell-life. Therefore, the existence of the heaven-life is found in the remaining three realms, excluding the hell realm, and the existence of the hell-life is found in the remaining three realms, excluding the heaven realm.

The conclusion of the above meaning is that except for the Tirthankara, heaven-life, and hell-life, the existence of all other natures is found in all realms. This means that in the hell realm, there are 147 natures existing without the heaven-life, in the Tiryanch realm, there are 147 natures existing without the Tirthankara nature, and in the heaven realm, there are 147 natures existing without the hell-life. But in the human realm, only 145 natures exist.

Previously, the binding, arising, and existence places of the karma natures were mentioned in the Gunasthanas, and the Gunasthanas are generally the Upshama Shreni, Kshapaka Shreni... 

Page #433:
---------------------------
This is a text from a Jain scripture, likely discussing the concept of "Upashamani" and "Kshapakani". Here's a translation:

**The text deals with the "Karma Granth" (text on Karma). Therefore, it is necessary to explain the nature of "Upashamani" and "Kshapakani". This first explains the nature of "Upashamani".**

**"Padmaphasaayachama, Vasatig, Sasaga, Visato, Upasanta, Avirat Sammatta, Aav Niyatthi, Naaycha." (Verse 62)**

**Word Meaning:**

* **Padmaphasaayachama:** The four "Kshaya" (passions) - Anantanubandhi Kshaya Chatushk.
* **Vasatig:** The three "Darshanmohaniya" (obscurations of perception).
* **Sasaga Visato:** The seven "Prakriti" (natures).
* **Upasanta:** Subdued, pacified.
* **Avirat Sammatta:** The state of "Avirat Samyagdristi" (uninterrupted right faith) - from the "Gunasthan" (spiritual stages) of "Avirat Samyagdristi" to "Apuvrakaran".
* **Aav Niyatthi:** The "Gunasthan" of "Apuvrakaran".
* **Naaycha:** One should know.

**Meaning of the Verse:**

One should know that the four "Kshaya" (passions) - Anantanubandhi Kshaya Chatushk, and the three "Darshanmohaniya" (obscurations of perception), these seven "Prakriti" (natures) are systematically pacified from the "Gunasthan" (spiritual stages) of "Avirat Samyagdristi" to "Apuvrakaran".

**Special Note:**

This verse explains the beginning of "Upashamani" by stating how it starts.

**Explanation:**

There are two categories for making the power of "Karma" inactive: "Upashamani" and "Kshapakani". The main goal of both categories is to make "Mohaniya Karma" (obscuring karma) inactive. In "Upashamani", the soul pacifies "Charitra Mohaniya Karma" (obscuring karma related to conduct), while in "Kshapakani", the soul destroys "Charitra Mohaniya Karma" and other karmas as much as possible. When the soul attains "Upashamani", it first pacifies the four "Anantanubandhi Kshaya" (passions), and then pacifies the three "Darshanmohaniya" (obscurations of perception), becoming eligible for "Upashamani". The pacification of these seven "Prakriti" (natures) begins in one of the "Gunasthan" (spiritual stages) of "Avirat Samyagdristi", "Deshavirat", "Pramattasanyat", "Aparamattasanyat", and "Apuvrakaran".

The seven *tikas* can be discussed in the context of *gunasthanas*, but according to the rules, they are pacified in the *apuurvakarana gunasthanas*. The *gatha* instructs on the pacification of the seven *prakritis*, starting with the *anantaanubandhi chatushk*. Therefore, we will first discuss this.

**Pacification of *Anantaanubandhi*:**

Regarding the pacification of the *anantaanubandhi chatushk*, the text states that a being who is:

1. **Avirat Samyagdrishti, Deshavirat, Virat (both *pramat* and *apramat*)**, and present in any of the *yogas*.
2. **Possessing any one of the four *manoyogas*, four *vachanayogas*, and *oudarik kayayogas*.**
3. **Having one of the three auspicious *leshyas* - *peet*, *padma*, and *shukla*.**
4. **Possessing *sakar upayog* (knowledge-based use).**
5. **Whose remaining seven *karmas* (excluding *ayukarma*) are situated within the *antar koda-kodi sagar*.**
6. **Whose *chittavritti* (mental activity) is progressively purified from the previous *antarmuhurt*.**
7. **Who has stopped binding with the *paravartaman* (past) inauspicious *prakritis* and started binding only with the auspicious *prakritis*.**
8. **Who has transformed the four-fold *anubhaga* (experience) of the inauspicious *prakritis* into two-fold, and the two-fold *anubhaga* of the auspicious *prakritis* into four-fold.**
9. **Who, upon the completion of one *sthitilbandh* (state of binding), starts binding with the next *sthitilbandh* with progressively fewer *palyas* (units of binding) compared to the previous *sthitilbandh*.**

Such a being is the one who pacifies the *anantaanubandhi chatushk*.

**1. Avirat Samyagdrishti, Deshavirat, Virat (both *pramat* and *apramat*)**, and present in any of the *yogas*.

**Tej:-Pam-Shukla* *leshyas* and possessing *sakar upayog*. The remaining seven *karmas* (excluding *ayukarma*) are situated within the *antar koda-kodi sagar*. The *chittavritti* (mental activity) is progressively purified from the previous *antarmuhurt*. Such a being has stopped binding with the *paravartaman* (past) inauspicious *prakritis* and started binding only with the auspicious *prakritis*.

## Sixth Karma Granth

For the subsidence of the four infinite bonds, the soul performs three actions: Yathapravrittakaran, Apurvakaran, and Anivrittikaran. In Yathapravrittakaran, the state remains the same as before the action. In Apurvakaran, many actions like Sthitibandha etc. start happening, hence it is called Apurvakaran. In Anivrittikaran, the purity of the soul is the same as that of a child of the same age, hence it is called Anivrittikaran.

Now, let's explain the above topic in detail. In Yathapravrittakaran, there is an infinite increase in purity at every moment, and the mechanism of auspicious natures like Yantra etc. continues as before. However, Sthitighāt, Rasaghat, Gunashreni, and Gunasankram do not occur because the required purity is not found here. And compared to other souls, in this action, there are countless Lok Praman Parinamas at every moment, which fall into six categories.

These six categories are of two types, with respect to loss and gain: 1. Infinite part loss, 2. Innumerable part loss, 3. Numbered part loss, 4. Numbered quality loss, 5. Innumerable quality loss, and 6. Infinite quality loss.

Auspicious actions bind, and inauspicious actions do not bind. It makes the inauspicious natures four-fold, with two stages, and the auspicious natures two-fold, with four stages. Even in the state of Sthiti, it makes the merit complete and prevents any further Sthitibandha, making it less than the previous Sthitibandha in terms of number.

- Sahatika Prakaran Tika, page 246

1. Yathapravrittakaran is also known as Purvapravrittakaran. In the Digambar tradition, Yathapravrittakaran is called Adhapravrittakaran.

2. It does not cause Sthitighāt, Rasaghat, Gunashreni, or Gunasankram, due to the absence of the required purity.

- Saptaatika Prakaran Tika, page 246 

Page #436:
---------------------------
## Chapter 70

There are six stages of loss. The six stages of growth are as follows: 1. Infinite part-growth, 2. Innumerable part-growth, 3. Numbered part-growth, 4. Numbered multiple-growth, 5. Innumerable multiple-growth, and 6. Final multiple-growth.

The meaning of these six stages is that when we consider a single being, the results of the second time are obtained with infinite purity compared to the results of the first time. And when we consider multiple beings, the results of multiple beings at the same time are obtained in six stages of degeneration. And the results of the second time are more special than the results of the first time in the first time of the process of becoming, the results of the third time are more special than the results of the second time, and the results of the fourth time are more special than the results of the third time. In this way, there are more and more special results until the final time of the process of becoming.

In this, the lowest purity in the first time is the least, the lowest purity in the second time is infinitely greater than that, and the lowest purity in the third time is infinitely greater than that. This process continues until the numbered part of the process of becoming is obtained. But the lowest purity obtained here is infinitely greater than the highest purity of the first time.

After that, the lowest purity of the next time of the numbered part of the process of becoming is infinitely greater than the highest purity of the first time. Again, the highest purity of the second time is infinitely greater than that. Again, the lowest purity of the second time after the numbered part of the process of becoming is infinitely greater than that.

In this way, one should know that each purity stage is multiplied infinitely upwards and downwards until the lowest purity stage is obtained in the final time of the process of becoming. But beyond this, the number of purity stages...

## Sixth Karma-dravya
### 366

The remaining ones should be multiplied by an infinite number, one after another. The time for Yathapravritta-karana is the measure of an Antarmuhurta.

In this way, after the Yathapravritta-karana ends in the Antarmuhurta time, another A-purva-karana occurs. Its explanation is as follows: In this, there are countless Lok-pramana results every moment, which are degraded in six places every moment. In this, the Jghana Vishuddhi is the least at the time of living, which is infinitely multiplied by the excellent Vishuddhi mentioned at the end of the Yathapravritta-karana. Again, the excellent Vishuddhi is infinitely multiplied in the time before that. After that, the Jghana Vishuddhi is infinitely multiplied in the second time from that. In this way, one should state in the same way every moment until the final time of A-purva-karana is reached.

At the first moment of A-purva-karana, the five actions of Sthiti-ghata, Rasa-ghata, Guna-shreni, Guna-samkrama, and Purva-sthiti-bandha begin simultaneously. Their meaning is as follows:

In Sthiti-ghata, the Sthiti-khanda, which is from the front part of the Sthiti existing in the Satya, is destroyed by the Antamhata time, which is at least as large as hundreds of Sagara-pramana and at least as small as the number of Palyas. And here, in the Sthiti which will not be discussed further, the Dalikas are deposited every moment, and in this way, the Sthiti-khanda is destroyed within an Antarmuhurta time. After that, the Sthiti-khanda, which is as large as the number of the second Palyas below it, is destroyed in the same way. In this way, thousands of Sthiti-khandas are destroyed in the time of A-purva-karana in the said order. Due to which, the Sthiti at the end of the time remains less than the Sthiti at the beginning of the time by a number of times. 

Page #438:
---------------------------
## The Chapter of Sapta-Tika

After explaining the meaning of *Sthiti-Ghat*, we now discuss *Rasa-Ghat*.

In *Rasa-Ghat*, the portion of the *ashubha* (unfavorable) nature that exists in the *satta* (being) is destroyed by the *antar-muhurt* (instantaneous) time, except for the infinite portion called *praman* (measure). Then, the remaining infinite portion, except for its infinite part, is destroyed by the *antar-muhurt* time. In this way, thousands of *anubhag* (parts) are consumed within the time of the emergence of each *sthiti-khand* (state-segment).

The form of the *guna-shreni* (series of qualities) is such that, except for the *antar-muhurt* *praman* state of the infinite *anubandhi* (connected) *chaturshka* (group of four), some *dalika* (particles) are taken from the *dalika*s of the higher state at each moment and deposited in the *antar-muhurt* *praman* state above the *udaya-avali* (ascending series). The process is as follows:

In the first moment, the least number of *dalika*s are established above the *udaya-avali* in the first moment, from those that are taken. In the second moment, an innumerable number of *dalika*s are established from these. In the third moment, an innumerable number of *dalika*s are established from these. In this way, an innumerable number of *dalika*s are deposited in increasing numbers until the end of the *antar-muhurt* time. This is the method of depositing the *dalika*s taken in the first moment. The *dalika*s taken in the second and subsequent moments are also deposited in the same way, but with this difference:

The *dalika*s taken in the first moment of the creation of the *guna-shreni* are the fewest. The *dalika*s taken in the second moment are innumerable times more than these. In the same way, the *dalika*s taken in the third and subsequent moments until the end of the *guna-shreni* creation are innumerable times more than the previous ones.

There is another peculiarity here: *Apuurvakaran*... 

Page #439:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karma Granth 4.1

As the time of **anivrittikaran** passes progressively, the deposition of **dalikas** of the **guna-shreni** occurs in the remaining time of **antar-muhurt** progressively, not in the time above **antar-muhurt**. For example, let's say the measure of **antar-muhurt** of **guna-shreni** is fifty time units, and the measure of time for both **apuurvakaran** and **anivrittikaran** is forty time units. Now, the living being who creates **guna-shreni** in the first time unit of **apuurvakaran** deposits **dalikas** in all the time units of **guna-shreni**, and in the second time unit, deposits **dalikas** in the remaining thirty-nine time units. In this way, as the time of **apuurvakaran** passes, the deposition of **dalikas** occurs in fewer and fewer time units.

**Guna-samkram** is the transfer of **dalikas** of **karma-prakritis**. Therefore, **guna-samkram** is a type of **pradesha-samkram**. In this, from the first time unit of **apuurvakaran**, there is a transfer of **karma-dalikas** of **adi-ashubha karma-prakritis**, which are bound infinitely, in an immeasurable, multiplied order, to the **prakritis** of the same type that are being bound at that time. This process begins from the first time unit of **apuurvakaran**.

The form of **sthiti-bandha** is such that the **sthiti-bandha** that occurs from the first time unit of **apuurvakaran** is very slightly less than the **sthiti-bandha** that occurred before it, i.e., **apuurva**. The rule regarding this is that both **sthiti-bandha** and **sthiti-ghat** begin together and end together. In this way, all five actions begin together in **apuurvakaran**.

When **apuurvakaran** ends, **anivrittikaran** occurs. In this, there is uniformity in the results of the living beings who enter it, i.e., this... 

Page #440:
---------------------------
## The Chapter of Sapta-tika

The way in which living beings entering into the karmic process differ in their physical characteristics, such as size, does not result in a difference in their karmic results. This means that the karmic results of beings existing simultaneously are the same, while the karmic results of beings existing at different times are entirely different.

The implication is that all beings who exist, existed, and will exist in the first time period of A-nivrttikarana have the same karmic results. Similarly, all beings who exist, existed, and will exist in the second time period have the same karmic results. The same understanding should be applied to the third and subsequent time periods. Therefore, there are as many karmic results as there are time periods of A-nivrttikarana, neither more nor less.

However, there is a special feature: the purity that occurs in the first and subsequent time periods increases infinitely in the second and subsequent time periods.

The five functions of A-purvakarana, namely Sthiti-dhatu, etc., continue to operate in A-nivrttikarana as well. When a portion of the Antarmukhurta time period remains after a number of portions have passed, the A-nanta-anubandhi Chatushva, excluding the lower Nishekas, are interchanged with the Antarmukhurta-pramana Nivekas. This process takes a time equal to the minimum Sthiti-bandha time period. If the interchange is done with the Udayavali Prakrutis, their position is considered Antarmukhurta-pramana, and if the interchange is done with the An-udayavali Prakrutis, their lower position is considered Avali-pramana.

1. The description of the karmic functions of Sthiti-dhatu, etc., has been explained in the context of A-purvakarana. The same understanding should be applied here.

2. The process of taking the Antarmukhurta-pramana Dalikas from the middle, excluding the lower and upper positions, and transferring them to other homogeneous Prakrutis that bind them is called Antar-karana. 

Page #441:
---------------------------
The sixth karma grantha, since it has to be intercalated here with the infinite-bound quartet, but does not arise in the fourth and higher guna sthana, therefore, its intercalation is done with the internal-momentary evidence dalikas above, leaving out the lower avli evidence dalikas.

Intercalation means interruption and karana means action. Accordingly, the row of dalikas of the natures whose intercalation is done is removed from the middle. This results in three states of dalikas - the first state, the intermediate state, and the upper or second state. The evidence of the first state is one avli or one internal-moment. After this, the intermediate state is obtained. This is the zero state from the dalikas. Its time evidence is also internal-moment. After this, the second state is obtained. Its evidence is the remaining state of the dalikas.

Before intercalation, the row of dalikas 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... remains uninterrupted, but after intercalation, its state becomes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The empty space that appears in the middle, some of the dalikas there are merged as much as possible into other homogeneous natures that are bound. The state below (before) this space of difference is called the first state and the state above (after) is called the second state. The time of intercalation of the arising natures and the evidence of the first state are the same, but the time of intercalation of the non-arising natures is much larger than the evidence of the first state. While the intercalation process is ongoing, one by one dalika of the arising natures comes into existence and becomes extinguished, and the first state of the non-arising natures...

## Translation:

**404**

The seven-fold categories of the *sthiti* (state) of each individual *dalik* (atom) are constantly being infected by the *stibuk* (subtle) transmission of similar natures arising in the *udaya* (manifestation).

Here, we are discussing the *upasama* (submergence) of the *ananta-anubandhi* (infinitely connected) [karma], but its *udaya* (manifestation) does not cease. Therefore, the *stibuk* (subtle) transmission of each *dalik* (atom) that is initially postponed also continues to infect other natures. In this way, when *antar-karana* (internalization) occurs, the *dalik* (atoms) of the second *sthiti* (state) of the *ananta-anubandhi* (infinitely connected) [karma] are submerged at a later time. In the first instance, the *dalik* (atoms) of the horse are submerged. In the second instance, an innumerable number of *dalik* (atoms) are submerged, and in the third instance, an even greater innumerable number of *dalik* (atoms) are submerged. In this way, until the *antar-muhata* (internalized) time, an innumerable number of *dalik* (atoms) are submerged at each instance. Within this time, the entire *ananta-anubandhi* (infinitely connected) [karma] is submerged.

Just as dust, when sprinkled and soaked with water and pounded with a pestle, becomes solidified, similarly, *karma* (action) dust, when sprinkled and soaked with the water of *vishuddhi* (purity) and pounded with the pestle of *anivritti-karan* (non-return), becomes incapable of *san-krama* (infection), *udaya* (manifestation), *udirana* (excitation), *nitti* (continuity), and *nika-chana* (extraction). This is called the *upasama* (submergence) of the *ananta-anubandhi* (infinitely connected) [karma].

However, other *acharyas* (teachers) believe that the *ananta-anubandhi* (infinitely connected) [karma] is *visan-yojama* (disassociated) after being submerged. *Visan-yojana* (disassociation) is the *kshapana* (destruction) of...

1. The *karma-prakriti* (karma-nature) text explicitly prohibits the *upasama* (submergence) of the *ananta-anubandhi* (infinitely connected) [karma]. It states that the beings of the fourth, fifth, and sixth *guna-sthana* (stages of spiritual development) in all four *gati* (paths) disassociate the *ananta-anubandhi* (infinitely connected) [karma] through the three *karana* (causes). However, during disassociation, neither *antar-karana* (internalization) nor the *upasama* (submergence) of the *ananta-anubandhi* (infinitely connected) [karma] occurs.

**"Four, five, and three disassociate through *visan-yojana* (disassociation). Through the *karana* (causes), neither *antar-karana* (internalization) nor *upasama* (submergence) occurs."** 

Page #443:
---------------------------
Sixth Firm Text
405 This is another name, but the only difference between disassociation and destruction is that the natures that are disassociated regain their existence, but the natures that are destroyed do not regain their existence.
The disassociation of the infinite-bound occurs in any one of the qualities from the uninterrupted samyadrishti quality-place to the unattentive-restrained quality-place. In the fourth quality-place, the beings of all four motions disassociate the infinite-bound. In the fifth quality-place, the Tithancha and humans disassociate the infinite-bound, and in the sixth and seventh quality-places, only humans disassociate the infinite-bound. For this also, as before, there are three times the Yashattkarana. But the special feature is that there is no need for introspection for disassociation, but except for the Avali Praman Dalikas, all the above Dalikas naturally transition to other homogeneous natures, and the Avali Praman Dalikas transition to the existing natures and destroy them.
Thus, the consideration of the suppression and disassociation of the infinite-bound has been considered. Now, consider the suppression of the three natures of the darshanamohi.
Mother Ha
In the Digambar tradition, the Kashayapahuḍ, its Chūṇi, Pakhaṇḍāgam, and Lakṣisār also mention the view of disassociation of the infinite-bound. Similar to the karma-nature, the Chūṇi of the Kāmapāhuḍ also clearly prohibits the upkāma of the infinite-bound, but in the Digambar tradition, the prevalent Saptaṭika also contains the view of suppression, and it is clear from the Go. Karmakāṇḍa that they were familiar with the view of suppression of the infinite-bound.

## Chapter 406: The Chapter of the Seventies

**On the Submergence of the Movable**

This rule is about the submergence of the three natures of the Darshanamohiya: Mithyatva, Samyagmithyatva, and Samyaktava. These three are the three stages of the Darshan Bhahanocha. Of these, Mithyatva is submerged by the Mithyashti and the Vedak Samyagdristi Jiva, but Samyaktava and Samyagmithyatva, these two natures, are submerged only by the Vedak Samyagdristi Jiva. Even in this, the Mithyadristi Jiva of all four gatis first generates Samyaktava and then submerges Mithyatva. The method of submerging Mithyatva should be known to be the same as the submergence of the Anantanubandhi Chatushka, which was explained earlier, but with this difference: in its A-purvakaran, there is no Gunasamkram, but there are four actions: Sthitighāt, Rasaghat, Sthitibandh, and Gunashreni.

1. In the Digambar Karbha Granthas, the instruction on this subject is this: the Mithyadristi submerges one Mithyatva, or both Mithyatva and Samyagmithyatva, or all three: Mithyatva, Samyagmithyatva, and Samyaktava. And the Samyagdristi, at the time of attaining the second submergence of Samyaktava, submerges all three. The Jiva who, having fallen from Samyavasa, goes into Mithyatva and violates the Vedak time, if he attains the submergence of Samyaktava at the time of the Udvalana of Samyaktava, then he submerges all three. The Jiva who, after the Udvalana of Samyaktava, attains the submergence of Samyaktava at the time of the Udvalana of Samyagmithyatva, submerges these two: Mithyatva and Samyagmithyatva. And the Mithyadristi who has the existence of all twenty-two natures of the Mohiya, submerges only one Mithyatva.

2. There, the submergence of Mithyatva is by the Mithyadristi and the Vedak Samyagdristi. But the submergence of Samyaktava and Samyagmithyatva is only by the Vedak Samyagdristi.

## Sixth Karma Granth

**407** The false view arises from the rule of false view. Therefore, the creation of its quality-potency occurs from the time of its arising. After the non-creation, it should be known in the same way in the non-obstruction. But when one part remains after the number of its parts has passed, then the internal moment of false view, leaving the lower inhibitors, is done at the end of the niryanas on the higher annalla proof. This action takes the same internal moment time as the new position bond. Here, some of the dalikas that are ended are placed in the first position and some in the second position, because the false view of false view does not have a transition of the other-nature form. In its first position, the dalikas of the first position are aroused until the time of the avali proof remains, but the dalikas of the second position are aroused only until two avali proof times remain in the first position. Here, the arousal of the dalikas of the second position is called agal.

In this way, when this being, experiencing the first position, experiences the dalika located at the last place of the first position, then it divides the dalikas of false view located in the second position above the internal moment, according to the section, into three parts. Of these, the pure part is called right view, the semi-pure part is called semi-false view, and the most impure part is called false view. It is also said in the Karma-prakriti Churni:

"From the extreme samyamadi to the extreme sammasammi, it becomes the viyithi, it does the three parts, sanjaha - sammatam sammammitatam micchattam bha."

In this way, when the first position ends, the dalika of false view does not arise, and thus the temporary right view is obtained. This...

## Chapter 408: The Sevenfold Chapter

**The attainment of the previously unattainable self-benefit occurs upon the attainment of Right Faith.**

"When Right Faith is attained, the previous self-benefit, which was unattainable, becomes attainable."

This first attainment of Right Faith is achieved through the complete cessation of False Faith. Those who attain it may be either "country-renouncing" or "all-renouncing." This means that after attaining Right Faith, efforts are made to attain Restraint.

However, the being does not ascend to the state of "Cessation-Right Faith" from this first cessation of False Faith, but rather from the second cessation of False Faith. Therefore, we will explain that the being who is a "knower" and has Right Vision, who has ceased the four passions and the three types of "perception-delusion," and has attained "Cessation-Right Faith," is called one who has attained the second cessation of False Faith. The cessation of the "infinitely-connected" passions has already been discussed. Now, we will briefly explain the method of cessation of the "perception-delusion."

The "knower" who has Right Vision and is established in Restraint, ceases the three natures of "perception-delusion." The three causes of their "proper functioning" should be understood as before, but with this difference: when the numbered parts of "non-functioning" have passed, and the "inner-reflection" is done, the first state of Right Faith is established as "internal-momentary" evidence, because this is the "knowable" nature. The first state of "Right-False Faith" and False Faith is established as "obstructive" evidence, because these two do not arise in the "knower" who has Right Vision. The "deposits" of these three natures, which are "inner-reflected" upon, are in the first state of Right Faith.

## Bandha Karma Granth 406

In the same way, the **dalikas** (sub-categories) of the first state of **mithyatva** (false belief) and **samyag mithyatva** (partially true belief) of this being continue to transition into the **dalikas** of the first state of **samyaktvam** (right belief) through **stikasamkram** (transition of states). Each **dalik** of the first state of **samyaktvam** arises and is destroyed. In this way, when the first state of **samyaktvam** weakens, the attainment of **dvitiyopasham samyaktvam** (second stage of right belief) occurs.

After attaining **dvitiyopasham samyaktvam**, the process of **upashamna** (subduing) of **charitra mohaniya** (karma that hinders conduct) begins. Therefore, we will now explain the process of **upashamna** of **charitra mohaniya**.

## Upashamna of Charitra Mohaniya

To subdue **charitra mohaniya**, three **karans** (actions) are performed: **yathpravrittakaran**, **apuurvakaran**, and **anivrittikaran**. The nature of these **karans** is the same as before, but with this difference: **yathpravrittakaran** occurs in the seventh **gunasthan** (stage of spiritual development) of **aprammatasanyata** (unwavering restraint), **apuurvakaran** occurs in the eighth **gunasthan** of **apuurvakaran**, and **anivrittikaran** occurs in the ninth **gunasthan** of **anivrittikaran**. Here too, in **apuurvakaran** and **anivrittikaran**, **sthitighāt** (destruction of states) and other aspects are the same as before. However, there is this difference: from the fourth to the seventh **gunasthan**, the **gunasamkram** (transition of qualities) that occurs in **apuurvakaran** and **abhivritikaran** is of the same nature as the **parinam** (results) related to them. But in **apuurvakaran**, the **gunasamkram** of all the **ashubh** (unwholesome) qualities that do not bind occurs. When a certain amount of time has passed during **apuurvakaran**, the binding of the two qualities of **nidra** (sleep) and **prachala** (restlessness) is broken. After this, when thousands of **sthitikhāṇḍas** (states) are destroyed, a large part of the time of **apuurvakaran** passes, leaving only a small part remaining. During this time, the binding of the following 30 qualities of **namakarma** (karma that affects the name and form) is broken:

After that, when the state of separation (Sthiti-Khand-Prithaktva) occurs, the final time of A-purva-karan is attained. In this, the bondage-severance of Hasy, Rati, Bhay and Jugupsa, the rise-severance of six No-Kshayas, and the destruction, annihilation and removal of all karmas, the mucchitti of the karmas of Desho-pashamana, Nidhatti and Nikachana occur. After this, entry into the Gunasthan of Anivrittikaran occurs.
In the Gunasthan of Anivrittikaran also, the actions like Sthiti-ghat etc. are the same as before. When the knowledge of the Paasha of Anivritti is attained, the differentiation of the 21 types of Charitra-mohaniya is done. At the time of differentiation, the first state of the Sanjwalan Kshaya, which arises from the four Sanjwalan Kshayas, and the first state of the Veda, which arises from the three Vedas, is established according to their respective time of arising. The first state of the other nineteen types is established as one Avali. The time of arising of Stri-veda and Napunsak-veda is the least. The time of arising of Purusha-veda is numerically multiplied by this. The time of arising of Sanjwalan Krodha is more than this. The time of arising of Sanjwalan Mana is more than this. The time of arising of Sanjwalan Maya is more than this and the time of arising of Sanjwalan Lobha is more than this. In Panchasangraha also, it is said in the same way:
"Tho-apumoraya-kala sangj-guno ra puriso-yaras.
Tatto vi vise-sa-hi-o kohe tatto vi mahak-maso." 1 Panchasangraha, 796

## Chapter on the Sevenfold Classification

**4.12**

When a man, climbing the ladder of virtue, experiences the **Jina** knowledge, the **dalikas** (minute particles) related to his inner consciousness are thrown into the first state, not the second, during the time of their arising, not their binding. This is similar to the **dalikas** related to the female knowledge, which are thrown into the first state during the arising of the female knowledge, not the second.

When a man, climbing the ladder of virtue, experiences the **karma** that binds but does not arise, the **dalikas** related to his inner consciousness are thrown into the second state, not the first. This is similar to the **dalikas** related to the remaining **sanjvalana** (passion), which are thrown into the second state during the arising of the **sanjvalana** of anger, not the first.

However, when a man, climbing the ladder of virtue, experiences the **karma** that neither binds nor arises, the **dalikas** related to his inner consciousness are thrown into other similar binding natures. This is similar to the **dalikas** related to the second and third **kṣayās** (passions).

Now, we will indicate the work done by the inner consciousness.

By inner consciousness, the **neuter knowledge** is pacified. In the first stage, the least number of **dalikas** are pacified. In the second stage, an innumerable number of **dalikas** are pacified. In this way, until the final stage is reached, an innumerable number of **dalikas** are pacified at each stage. At the same time, an innumerable number of **dalikas** are thrown into other natures. This process continues until the penultimate stage. In the final stage, an innumerable number of **dalikas** are pacified, more than the number that are thrown into other natures. After this, in one **antarmuhūrta** (a very short period of time), the **female knowledge** is pacified. After this, in one **antarmuhūrta**, the six **hāsyādi** (laughter, etc.) are pacified. The six **hāsyādi**...

For detailed knowledge in this regard, one should refer to the **Karmapratikrama Tika**. Here, only a brief explanation is given.

##  Pashta Karmagrantha

**413** Upon the subsidence of the six passions (**upashama**), the bondage, arising, and excitation of the **purushaveda** and the first state (**prathamasthiti**) are severed. However, this severance occurs only until two **avali** remain in the first state. From this point onwards, the **dalikas** of the six **nokashayas** are not thrown into the **purushaveda**, but are thrown into **sanjwalan** (burning), anger, etc.

After the subsidence of the six passions (laughter, etc.), the **purushaveda** subsides completely in a period of two **avali** less than two **avali**. In the first period, the subsidence of the fewest **dalikas** occurs. In the second period, the subsidence of an innumerable number of **dalikas** occurs. In the third period, the subsidence of an innumerable number of **dalikas** greater than the previous period occurs. This subsidence continues in this manner until the end of the period of two **avali** less than two **avali**. And until the period of two **avali** less than two **avali**, the **dalikas** are deposited into the other natures (**paraprakritis**) through the **sakrama** (action) that is occurring at that time. In the first period, the deposition of many **dalikas** occurs. In the second period, the deposition of particularly fewer **dalikas** occurs. In the third period, the deposition of even fewer **dalikas** than the previous period occurs. This should be understood in the same way until the final period.

When the six passions (laughter, etc.) subside and the first state of the **purushaveda** weakens, the subsidence of **apratyakhyanavaran** anger, **pratyakhyanavaran** anger, and **sanjwalan** anger begins simultaneously. When one **avali** less than three **avali** remain in the first state of **sanjwalan** anger, the **dalikas** of **apratyakhyanavaran** anger and **pratyakhyanavaran** anger are not deposited into **sanjwalan** anger, but are deposited into **sanjwalan** pride, etc.

**1**  In the two **avali**, the first state is left behind.
**Karmaprakriti** Chapter 107 

Page #452:
---------------------------
## The Chapter of the Seven Tika

When two *avali* periods remain, there is no *agala* (intense burning), but only *udirana* (arising). When one *avali* period remains, the *bandha* (bond), *udaya* (arising), and *udirana* of *sanjvalana krodha* (burning anger) are severed, and *apratyakhyanavaran krodha* (unconcealed anger) and *pratyakhyanavaran krodha* (concealed anger) are pacified. At that time, except for the *dalikas* (particles) bound by one *avali* period in the first state and those bound by two *avali* periods minus one *samaya* (moment) in the higher state, the remaining *dalikas* are pacified.

Then, the *dalikas* bound by one *avali* period in the first state are deposited in the *sanjvalana mana* (burning mind) in sequence through *stibukasamkram* (a process of gradual transfer), and the *dalikas* bound by two *avali* periods minus one *samaya* are treated like *purushaveda* (a type of knowledge) and are *manrita* (absorbed) by the *prakriti* (nature). In this way, after the pacification of *apratyakhyanavaran krodha* and *pratyakhyanavaran krodha*, the *sanjvalana krodha* is pacified in two *avali* periods minus one *samaya*.

From the time the *bandha*, *udaya*, and *udirana* of *sanjvalana krodha* are severed, until the second state of the *sanjvalana mana*, the *dalikas* are brought back to their first state and *vedana* (feeling) occurs. When bringing them back to the first state, in the first *samaya*, the fewest *dalikas* are deposited. In the second *samaya*, an innumerable number of *dalikas* are deposited. In the third *samaya*, an innumerable number of times more *dalikas* are deposited. In this way, until the final *samaya* of the first state, an innumerable number of times more *dalikas* are deposited.

**First State**

1. In three *avali* periods, *apratyakhyanavaran* is *sanjalana* (burning).

## Sixth Karma Group

From the first moment of its creation, it simultaneously begins to subside along with the A-pratyakhyanavaran and Pratyakhyanavaran Manas. When one time less than three Avaliya Kalas remain in the first state of the Sanjvalan Mana, it does not project the A-pratyakhyanavaran and Pratyakhyanavaran Manas's Dalikas into the Sanjvalan Mana, but instead projects them into the Sanjvalan Maya Gati. With two remaining, there is no Agala, but only Udirana. When one Avaliya Kala remains, the binding, arising, and Udirana of the Sanjvalan Mana cease, and the A-pratyakhyanavaran and Pratyakhyanavaran Manas subside. At that time, all Dalikas except for the one Avaliya Praman Dalikas in the first state of the Sanjvalan Mana and the Dalikas bound in the one time less than two Avaliya Kalas in the higher state subside.

**415**

Thereafter, it deposits the one Avaliya Praman Sanjvalan Mana Dalikas into the Sanjvalan Maya through Titbuksankrama, and subsides the Dalikas bound in one time less than two Avaliya Kalas like the Guru-Shveda, and transitions naturally. In this way, after the A-pratyakhyanavaran and Pratyakhyanavaran Manas subside, the Sanjvalan Mana subsides in one time less than two Avaliya Kalas. From the time the binding, arising, and Udirana of the Sanjvalan Mana cease, it takes the Dalikas from the second state of the Sanjvalan Maya and brings them to their first state, causing them to experience Vedana. From that same time, it simultaneously begins to subside the A-pratyakhyanavaran Maya, Pratyakhyanavaran Maya, and Sanjvalan Maya. In the first state of the Sanjvalan Maya, one time less than three... 

Page #454:
---------------------------
## Chapter 416: The Seven-Fold Cycle

When seven *avali* cycles remain, the *sanjvalana* *maya* does not project the *dalikas* of *apratyakhyanavaran* *maya* and *pratyakhyanavaran* *maya* into *maya*, but projects them into *lobha*. When two *avali* cycles remain, there is no *agala*, only *udirana*. When one *avali* cycle remains, the *sanjvalana* *maya* is severed from its bondage, arising, and *udirana*, and the *apratyakhyanavaran* and *pratyakhyanavaran* *maya* subside. At that time, all *dalikas* except those bound in the first position for one *avali* cycle and those bound in the higher position for two *avali* cycles minus one time period, subside.

Then, the *dalikas* bound in the first position for one *avali* cycle are deposited into *sanjvalana* *maya* in sequence through the *stibukasakrama*, and the *dalikas* bound for two *avali* cycles minus one time period subside like *purushaveda* and transition naturally. In this way, after the *apratyakhyanavaran* *maya* and *pratyakhyanavaran* *maya* subside, the *sanjvalana* *maya* subsides after two *avali* cycles minus one time period.

From the time the *sanjvalana* *maya* is severed from its bondage, arising, and *udirana*, the *dalikas* are taken from the second position of *sanjvalana* *lobha* and are experienced for two-thirds of their *lobha* *vedaka* time period, establishing the first position. The first third is called the *ashvakarnakarana* time period, and the second third is called the *kittikaranakala*. In the first *ashvakarnakarana* time period, the *dalikas* are taken from the previous competitors and become new competitors.

**Explanation of Competitor:**

A living being is constantly made up of an infinite number of atoms in the form of *skandhas*. 

Page #455:
---------------------------
The sixth karma grantha receives karma in its form. In each of these skandhas, the most subtle rasa-filled atom, when pierced by the intellect, obtains infinite times more indivisible intersections than all beings. Other atoms obtain one more indivisible intersection. Thus, one should increase the indivisible intersections of rasa in each atom by one, until the infinite part of the Siddhas obtains more of its indivisible intersections. Here, the community of as many atoms as there are with the most subtle rasa is called a vargana. The community of atoms with one more rasa is called the second vargana. The community of atoms with two more rasa is called the tatri vargana. Thus, the total number of varganas is obtained from the infinite part of the Siddhas or from the infinite times more than the abhanyas. The community of all these varganas is called a spardhak.

Other adi spardhaks are also obtained in the same way, but with this special feature: in each varga of the last vargana of the first adi spardhak, there are infinite times more indivisible intersections of rasa than all beings in each varga of the first vargana of the second adi spardhak, and then the indivisible intersections of rasa increase by one until the last vargana of their respective spardhaks. All these spardhaks are appropriate from the beginning of the worldly beings. Therefore, they are called purva spardhaks. But here, the dalikas are taken from them and their rasa is made extremely low, therefore they are called apurva spardhaks.

This means that in the state of the world, this being had never made such spardhaks in relation to bondage, but now it does so due to the intensity of purification, therefore they are called apurva spardhaks.

This action is performed in the first division. In the second division, the purva...

## Chapter 418: The Sapta-Tika

Taking the Dalikas from among the competitors and the unprecedented competitors, it makes infinite Kittis at every moment, that is, by taking the classifications from the previous competitors and the unprecedented competitors and reducing their essence by an infinite factor, it creates intervals in the indivisible segments of Rasa. For example, let's say the indivisible segments of Rasa were one hundred and one and one hundred and two, they are reduced to five, fifteen, and twenty-five. This is called Kittikaran.

At the end of the Kittikaran period, the A-pratyakhyanavaran Lobha subdues the Pratyakhyanavaran Lobha, and at the same time, the Sanjvalan Lobha is unbound. With the rise of the Badar Sanjvalan and the cessation of Udirana, the ninth Gunasthan ends. Up to this point, twenty-five natures of Mohaniya are subdued. With the subduing of A-pratyakhyanavaran-Pratyakhyanavaran Lobha, twenty-seven natures are subdued. After this comes the Sukhmasampray Gunasthan. Its duration is an Antarmuhurta. In the beginning of this period, it takes some Kittis from the higher state and makes them return to their original state for the duration of the Sukhmasampray period, and it subdues the remaining Dalikas, which are bound in two Avaliks and have attained the subtle state, in one less period.

Then, at the end of the Sukhmasampray Gunasthan, the Sanjvalan Lobha is subdued. In this way, twenty-eight natures of Mohaniya are subdued. At the same time, the Jnanavaran is subdued by five,

1. The number of subdued natures up to the Anivriti-Badar Gunasthan is as follows:
    * Twenty-two, sixteen, eighteen, twenty, twenty-two, twenty-five, twenty-six, and then twenty-eight.

## Sixth Karma Group

- There are sixteen natures: four of Darshanavarana, five of Antaray, and Yash:Kiti and high lineage. These sixteen natures experience bondage and liberation. 
- After this, in the next time period, the eleventh Gunasthan, Upshantakashaya, occurs. In this, all the natures of Mohaniya are quieted. The minimum time period of Upshantakashaya Gunasthan is one time period, and the maximum is the time period of Usmsrushta Karma Antarmui.
- When the Arohak of Upshamani reaches the eleventh Upshantamoha Gunasthan, it then falls according to the rules. This fall happens in two ways: Bhavakshaya and Adhakshaya. The fall that happens when the lifespan ends is called Bhavakshaya. Bhava means Paryaya (cycle) and Kshaya means destruction. The fall that happens when the time period of Upshantakashaya Gunasthan ends is called Adhakshaya.
- The one who falls due to Bhavakshaya, in the next time period, attains the Aviraat Samyagdristi Gunasthan. Before that time period, the beginning of all Karmas, including Bandha, occurs. But the one who falls due to Adhakshaya, i.e., the fall that happens after the time period of Upshantamoha Gunasthan ends, falls in the same order as it ascended. When it reaches the point where the destruction of a particular Karma occurred, the beginning of that Karma starts again, and the Jiva stops at the Prammat Sanyat Gunasthan. Some attain the Deshavirat and Aviraat Samyagdristi Gunasthan, and some attain the Sasadan Bhava.
- Generally, one attains Upshamani once in a Bhava. Sometimes, a Jiva may attain Upshamani twice... - - - - 27th Suhme, 28th Mi, Mohapedeyo.

## Translation:

**420**

The chapter on the seven types of *upashamana* does not occur more than this. The one who attains *upashamana* twice does not have *kshapikani* in that existence, but the one who attains *upashamana* once, may have *kshapikani*.

Although the *gatha* mentions the *sanat* qualities, *gunadhi*, *yamuna*, and *mohak* as *upashamana* of the seven types and indicates their order, the commentator Acharya Malayagiri, in this context, has also discussed the *visanyojana* of *anantaanubandhi* and the *upashamana* of *charitra mohaniya*.

After stating *upashamana*, the desire to state *kshapikashreni* arises. Before that, it is indicated where and in what order the attainment of *kshayika samyaktv* occurs.

**"Padhamakasayachaupkham etto micchassameesassammatam. Avirya dese virae pamatti apamatti khoyanthi." (63)**

**Word Meaning:**

* *Padhamakasayachakkam* - The first four *kashayas* (the four *kashayas* of *anantaanubandhi*)
* *Etto* - Thereafter, after this
* *Micchassameesassammat* - Falsehood, mixed, and *ramyaktv* *mohaniya*

* *Vese* - Country-renounced
* *Virae* - Renounced
* *Pamatti* - Mindful
* *Apamatti* - Unmindful
* *Khoyanthi* - Decay, destruction

**Meaning of the *gatha*:**

In the four *gunasthanas* of uninterrupted *samyagdristi*, country-renounced, mindful-renounced, and unmindful-renounced, the destruction of falsehood, mixed, and *ramyaktv* *mohaniya* occurs.

**"Jo duve vare javsamsevin padivajji tassa niyama tammi bhave khavgashedi natthi, jo ekkaasi unsamsehi padivajji tassa svavagaseti hojji va."**

**"Mohopashama ekasmin bhave dwi: smadasantatah. Yasmin bhave tupashamah kshayo mohasya satra na."**

- **Complete:** The destruction of *moha* occurs twice in one existence. In that existence, the destruction of *moha* is not *kshayika*.

## The Karma Granth of the Vashta

**Chapter 421**

The fourfold *kṣaya* (destruction) of the *ananta-anubandhi* (infinitely connected) *kaṣāya* (passions) in the *guṇasthāna* (stages of spiritual development), followed by the destruction of *mithyātva* (false belief), *miśra* (mixed), and *samyaktva-mohaniya* (delusion of right belief), occurs in a specific order.

**Explanation:**

After discussing the *upaśama-śreṇī* (stages of pacification) in the previous verse, this verse introduces the *kṣapaka-śreṇī* (stages of destruction) as the initial preparation for the *kṣapaka-śreṇī*.

In the *upaśama-śreṇī*, the nature of the *mohaniya* (delusive) karmas is pacified. In the *kṣapaka-śreṇī*, they are destroyed. This means that in the *upaśama-śreṇī*, the nature of the karmas remains, but the *dalika* (individual soul) experiences an internal transformation for a brief moment, becoming incapable of experiencing the effects of the karmas. However, in the *kṣapaka-śreṇī*, the karmas are completely destroyed.

One might argue that the karmas could be reborn through *bandha* (binding). However, this is not possible because it is a rule that the karmas of a *samyagdṛṣṭi* (rightly seeing) individual are completely destroyed, and they are not subject to *bandha* or the transformation into other karmas. Therefore, the rebirth of such karmas is impossible.

However, the fourfold *ananta-anubandhi* karmas are an exception to this rule. Their destruction is described using the term "tri-saṁyoga" (threefold union).

After this discussion, we will now examine the *kṣapaka-śreṇī*. First, we will discuss the qualifications of the individual who can experience it.

**The Beginning of the *Kṣapaka-śreṇī***

The *kṣapaka-śreṇī* begins only for those who are over eight years old, possess *uttama-saṁhanana* (excellent concentration), are in the fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh *guṇasthāna*, and are *jīnakālika* (living in the time of a Tirthankara). It does not begin for anyone else.

First, the *ananta...*

## Chapter of the Seven Tika
#### 422

This section deals with the disassociation of the fourfold bond. Subsequently, it initiates the simultaneous destruction of false belief, right-false belief, and right belief. For this, there are three causes, namely, the "Yathapravritta" and the other two. The description of these causes has already been given, and it should be understood in the same way here. However, there is a special feature: in the initial stage of the "Apuurvakaran," the "Dalikas" of false belief and right-false belief are deposited into right belief through "Gunasanakrama." Also, in the "Apuurvakaran," there is a "Uvalana Sanakrama" of both. In this, first, the "Uvalana" of the largest "Sthitikhanda" is done. Subsequently, the "Uvalana" of each individual smaller "Sthitikhanda" is done. This process continues until the end of the "Apuurvakaran." Due to this, the number of "Sthitikhandas" at the end of the "Apuurvakaran" becomes infinitely smaller than the number at the beginning.

After this, it enters the "Anivritikaran." Here also, the functions like "Sthitighāt" continue as before. In the initial stage of the "Anivritikaran," the "Deshopaśamana," "Nirdhātti," and "Nikachana" of the "Darsanatrika" are severed. From the initial stage of the "Anivritikaran" onwards, after the destruction of thousands of "Sthitikhandas," the "Sthiti-satta" of the "Darsanatrika" remains suitable for the "Asangni." After this, after the destruction of a thousand "Prithaktva-pramāna" "Sthitikhandas," the "Sthiti-satta" remains suitable for the four-sensory being. After this, after the destruction of the aforementioned "Pramāna" "Sthitikhandas," the "Sthiti-satta" remains suitable for the three-sensory being. After this, after the destruction of the aforementioned "Pramāna" "Sthitikhandas," the "Sthiti-satta" remains suitable for the two-sensory being. After this, after the destruction of the aforementioned "Pramāna" "Sthitikhandas," the "Sthiti-satta" remains suitable for the one-sensory being.

After that, it destroys a large portion of the three natures, leaving only a small part. Then, it destroys a large portion of the remaining part, leaving only a small part. In this way, it destroys thousands of *sthiti-khandas* in this sequence. After that, it destroys countless parts of the *mithyatva* state and a countable number of parts of the *samyamithyatva* and *samyaktava* states. 

As a result of the passing of these numerous *sthiti-khandas*, only a *dalik* of *mithyatva* remains, and an immeasurable fraction of *dalik* of *samyamithyatva* and *samyaktava* remains. 

While destroying these *sthiti-khandas*, the *dalik* related to *mithyatva* is considered as *sayamithyatva*. The *dalik* related to *samyamithyatva* is deposited in *samyaktava*, and the *dalik* related to *samyaktava* is deposited in the *dalik* of a lower state. 

In this way, when only one *dalik* of *mithyatva* remains, it is also deposited in *samyaktava* through *stibhuka-samkrama*. After that, it destroys countless parts of *samyamithyatva* and *samyaktava*, leaving only one part. Then, it destroys countless parts of that remaining part, leaving only one part. In this way, after the passing of many *sthiti-khandas* in this sequence, only one *dalik* of *samyamithyatva* and eight *varsha* of *samyaktava* remain.

At this time, this being is considered a destroyer of *darshan-mohaniya* from the perspective of *nishchayanya*. After this, it initiates the *utkirana* of the *antar-mahurta* of *samyaktava*. While initiating *utkirana*, it deposits the *dalik* from the time of its emergence. It deposits the fewest *dalik* at the first time, countless times more *dalik* at the second time, and countless times more *dalik* at the third time. In this way, it...

## The Chapter of the Seven Tika

The **guna-shreni** continues until the end. After that, it deposits fewer and fewer **dalikas** until the final state is reached.

This process continues until the **dvi-charam sthiti-khand** is attained. However, the **dvi-charam sthiti-khand** is numerically larger than the final **sthiti-khand**. When the being has completely eradicated the final **sthiti-khand** of **samyak-tva**, it is called **krit-karan**. If a being dies during this **krit-karan** period, it is born in any of the four **gatis** according to its **par-bhav** related lifespan. At this time, it also attains other **leshyas** except for the **shukla leshya**. Thus, the destruction of **darshan-mohaniya** begins in the human **gati**, but its completion occurs in all four **gatis**. As it is said:

**"Patthavago umanusso, nitthavago vigai."**

The destruction of **darshan-mohaniya** begins in the human **gati**, but its completion occurs in all four **gatis**.

If a **bandha-ayushk** being begins the **kshapka-shreni**, then after the destruction of the **ananta-anubandhi chatushk**, it is possible for it to be nourished. In that situation, due to the rise of **mithyatva**, this being again accumulates **ananta-anubandhi** through **bandha** and **samkrama**, because in the rise of **mithyatva**, the **ananta-anubandhi** exists by rule. But the one who has destroyed **mithyatva** does not accumulate the **ananta-anubandhi chatushk** again. After the destruction of the seven **prakritis**, the one whose **parinam** does not change, dies and is born in the **deva** **gati** by rule. 

Page #463:
---------------------------
425
The sixth karma is called *karma*, but it is also born in other destinies according to the results that change.
Even if a bound-life being does not die at that time, it remains there when the seven *prakritis* are destroyed, it does not strive to destroy the *charitra mohaniya*.
*Yaau padivanno, niyama khommi sattae thaga.* But a bound-life being who becomes a god or a hell being after destroying the seven *prakritis* attains liberation in the third *paryaya* according to the rule, and the one who becomes a human or an animal is born only among humans and animals with an immeasurable lifespan, therefore he attains liberation in the fourth *bhava* according to the rule. If an unbound-life being begins the *kshapka shreni*, then it strives to destroy the *charitra mohaniya* karma after the seven *prakritis* are destroyed. Because a human who destroys *charitra mohaniya* is *abjnayu*, therefore his hell-life, god-life and animal-life do not exist naturally, and the four *ananta anubandhi* and *darshan mohaniya* are destroyed in the aforementioned order.

## Chapter on the Seven Tika

This is why, for a being who destroys the four types of *charitramohaniya*, the ten natures do not exist according to the rules.

A being who destroys *charitramohaniya* also has the three karmas of *yathapravritta*, *apuurvakarana*, and *anivrittikarana*. Here, *yathapravritta* occurs in the seventh *gunasthan*, while *apuurvakarana* is in the eighth *gunasthan* and *anivrittikarana* is in the ninth *gunasthan*. The nature of these three karmas has been explained before, so you should understand them accordingly.

Here, in *apuurvakarana*, the being destroys the eight natures of *apratyakhyanavaran* and *pratyakhyanavaran* kshaya through *sthitighat* etc., so that in the first moment of the ninth *gunasthan*, their existence remains only as an infinitesimal part of a *palya*. After the passage of countless *sankaat* of *anivrittikarana*, the sixteen natures of *styanadvinik*, *haapani*, *narakanupurti*, *tiryanchgaati*, *liyanchanupurvi*, *ekendriya* etc. (the four types of *jaati*), *sthavar*, *aatap*, *udyot*, *sukshma*, and *saadharan* are destroyed through the transition of their existence, leaving only an infinitesimal part of a *palya* remaining. Then, through the transition of *gunas*, they are completely destroyed by being projected into the *bandhyaman* natures every moment.

Although the destruction of the eight natures of *apratyakhyanavaran* and *pratyakhyanavaran* kshaya begins earlier, the destruction of the sixteen natures of *styanadvinik* etc. occurs in the middle of their destruction. After their destruction, the destruction of the eight natures occurs in the next moment.

Mentioning Different Opinions

However, some Acharyas hold the view that although the destruction of the sixteen Kashayas begins earlier, the destruction of the sixteen substances like Sthyanaddhitrika etc. occurs only after the destruction of the eight Kashayas. After this, the nine Nokashayas and four Sanjwalanas, these thirteen substances, are destroyed by the Antarkaran. After Antarkaran, the upper situated Dalikas of the Napumsakaved are destroyed by the Udvalana method, and in this way, in an Antarmuhurt, its Paly remains in the state of an innumerable part. After that, its (Napumsakaved's) Dalikas are deposited in other substances that bind through Gunasamkram. In this way, its complete destruction occurs in an Antarmuhurt. Here, it is important to know that the Jiva who ascends to the Kshapakani with the rise of the Napumsakaved, destroys its lower Dalikas while experiencing Vedana. In this way, after the destruction of the Napumsakaved, the destruction of the Strived occurs in the same order in an Antarmuhurt! After that, the destruction of the six Nokashayas begins simultaneously. After the beginning of the destruction of the six Nokashayas, their transition does not occur in the Purushaved, but in the Sanjwalana Krodha, and in this way, their destruction is done. The Sutra also says, "... 'Pachcha Napumsagam Sthi. To Nokasayachhakke Chumma Sanjwalagakohhammi.' At the time when the six Nokashayas are destroyed, the Vyuchchitti of the Bandha, Udaya, and Udirana of the Purushaved occurs, and leaving aside the Prabddha of two Avali time units less than one time unit, the remaining Dalikas of the Purushaved...

## Chapter 428: The Seven Tika

**What is destroyed?** Here, the **purushaveda** has already ceased to arise and be stimulated, therefore it becomes **apgatavedi**.

This statement should be understood in relation to a being who ascends the **kshapka** श्रेणी (category) due to the arising of **purushaveda**. However, a being who ascends the **kshapka** श्रेणी due to the arising of **napumsakaved** destroys **sap** and **sandhed** simultaneously. At the time when **striveda** and **napumsakaved** are destroyed, **purushaveda** is liberated from bondage. Afterwards, it becomes **apgatavedi** and destroys **purushaveda** and the six **nokashayas** simultaneously.

If a being ascends the **kshapka** श्रेणी due to the arising of **striveda**, it destroys **napumsakaved** first and then **striveda**. However, even in this case, **purushaveda** is liberated from bondage at the time of **striveda**'s destruction. Afterwards, it becomes **apgatavedi** and destroys **purushaveda** and the six **nokashayas** simultaneously.

**Description of the kshapka श्रेणी based on purushaveda**

A being who ascends the **kshapka** श्रेणी due to the arising of **purushaveda** and is experiencing the **krodha** कषाय (passion), after the cessation of **purushaveda**, the duration of **krodha** कषाय is divided into three parts: **ashvakarnakarana** काल, **kittikarana** काल, and **kittivedana** काल.

1. **Ashvakarnakarana** काल: **Ashvakarna** refers to the ear of a horse. It is large at the base and gradually narrows towards the top. Similarly, the **karana** (cause) in which the four **sanjvalanas** (agitations) from **krodha** (anger) to **loma** (hair) gradually become infinitely smaller, is called **ashvakarnakarana**. It is also known as **aavolkarana** and **uvarthanapvarthanakarana**.

2. **Kittikarana**: **Kitti** means to make thin. Therefore, the **karana** in which the previous...

**Time** | When this being exists in the time of *Ashvakarnakarana*, it constantly performs infinite *Apuurva* *Spardhakas* above the *Antar Karana* of the four *Sanjwalanas*. And in one time less than two *Avalika* *Pramanakalas*, it destroys the *Dalikas* of the *Purusha Veda* bound in that time, by transferring them to the *Sanjwalana* of *Krodha*. Here, first *Guna Sanakrama* occurs, and at the last moment, *Sarva Sanakrama* occurs.

Upon the completion of the *Ashvakarnakarana* time, it enters the *Kittikarana* time. Although *Kittis* are infinite, they are twelve in gross form, three each in every *Kashay*. But the being that ascends to the *Kshapakani* from the rise of *Mana*, destroys *Krodha* through the method of *Udbhalana*, and *Kittis* the remaining three *Kashayas* nine times! If the being ascends to the *Adhyakshapakani* from the rise of *Bhasha*, it destroys *Krodha* and *Mana* through the method of *Udbhalana*, and *Kittis* the remaining two *Kashayas* six times. And if the being ascends to the *Kshapakani* from the rise of *Lobha*, it destroys *Kosa*, *Mana*, and *Maya* through the method of *Udbhalana*, and *Kittis* the three *Kittis* of *Lobha*.

Thus, upon the completion of the *Kittikarana* time, the being that has ascended to the *Kshapak* *Shreni* from the rise of *Krodha*, by repelling the *Dalika* situated in the second state of the first *Kitti*, brings it to the first state and experiences its *Vedan* until one time more than one *Avalika* *Pramanakala* remains. Afterwards, it repels the *Dalika* situated in the second state of the second *Kitti*, bringing it to the first state.

From the *Spardhakas* and *Apuurva Spardhakas*, the *Dalikas* are taken and their sections are made infinitely *Gunahina* and established by intervals. This is called *Kittikarana*. One *Kitti* *Vanakala* - the time of experiencing and accepting the *Kittis* is called *Kittivedanakala*.

The chapter of the seven. And for one time more than one *āvalikā* *pramāṇakāla* remaining, it torments it. After that, it draws down the *dalika* situated in the second position of the third *kitti* and makes it first position and torments it for one time more than one *āvalikā* *pramāṇakāla* remaining. And during the time of torment of these three *kittis*, it deposits the *dalika* situated in the upper position by means of *guṇasamkrame* in the *sanjvalana* *māna* every time. And when the final time of torment of the third *kitti* is attained, the *sanjvalana* *krodha* *bandha*, *udaya* and *udīraṇā* are all severed together.
At this time, except for the *dalikas* bound by two *āvalikā* *pramāṇakāla* less than one time, the rest are absent. Thereafter, it draws down the *dalika* situated in the second position of the first *kitti* of *māna* and makes it first position and torments it for one *antarmuhurta* time. And it also makes the *sanjvalana* *krodha* *bandhakāla* *pramāṇakrama* of *māna* within the time of torment of the first *kitti* by two *āvalikā* *pramāṇakāla* less than one time. Here, *guṇasamkrame* takes place for two times less than two *āvalikā* time and in the final time, there is *sarva-samkrame*.
In this way, it torments the first *kitti* of *māna* for one time more than one *āvalikā* remaining. And thereafter, it draws down the *dalika* situated in the second position of the second *kitti* of *māna* and makes it first position and torments it for one time more than one *āvalikā* time remaining. Thereafter, it draws down the *dalika* situated in the second position of the third *kitti* and makes it first position and torments it for one time more than one *āvalikā* time remaining. At the same time, the *bandha*, *udaya* and

## Sixth Karma Granth

The Udirana is severed, and in the being, only the Dalik bound by two Avaliks less than one time remain, and the rest are absent.

Then, by drawing down the Dalik situated in the second state of the first Kitty of Maya, it makes it the first state and experiences it for one Antarmuhurt time. And when the bonds of Maya, etc., are severed, it deposits its Dalik in Maya through Gunasankrama for two Avaliks less than one time. It experiences it until one Avaliks more than one time of the first Kitty of Maya remains.

Then, by drawing down the Dalik situated in the second state of the second Kitty of Maya, it makes it the first state and experiences it until one Avaliks more than one time remains. After that, by drawing down the Dalik situated in the second state of the third Kitty of Maya, it makes it the first state and experiences it until one Avaliks more than one time remains. At this time, the bonds of Maya, Uday, and Udirana are severed together, and in the being, only the Dalik bound by two Avaliks less than one time remain, the rest are absent.

Then, by drawing down the Dalik situated in the second state of the first Kitty of Lobha, it makes it the first state and experiences it for one Antarmuhurt time. And when the bonds of Maya, etc., are severed, it deposits its newly bound Dalik in Lobha through Gunasankrama for two Avaliks less than one time. It experiences it until one Avaliks more than one time of the first Kitty of Maya remains. 

Page #470:
---------------------------
## Chapter 432: The Sevenfold Chapter

Afterward, in the second state of the subtle kitti, the dalik is drawn back to the first state and tormented for a period of time equal to one avalika kal less than one time. When this being torments the second kitti, it then creates a subtle kitti of the dalik of the third kitti. This action also continues for a period of time equal to one avalika kal less than one time, the same as the time of tormenting the second kitti. At the time when the act of creating the subtle kitti ends, the bond of sanjwalan lobha is broken, the badarakshaya arises, the udirana is severed, and the time of the anivrittibadar sampray gunasthan is severed.

Thereafter, the dalik situated in the second state of the subtle kitti is drawn back to the first state and tormented. From this time, this being is called a sukshmasaray.

For a period of time equal to one part remaining of the sukshmasampray gunasthan, this being, through the position-destruction, etc., of the subtle kitti-bound dalik, also decays every moment by two avalikas less than one time. Afterward, the remaining one part is equalized to the time of the sukshmasampray gunasthan by the conversion of sanjwalan lobha through sarvapravartana. The time of the sukshmasampray gunasthan is only an antarmuhurta. From here onwards, the position-destruction, etc., of sanjwalan lobha cease, but the position-destruction, etc., of the remaining karmas continue. This state, converted through sarvapravartana, is tormented by the arising and udirana for a period of time equal to one avalika kal less than one time. Afterward, the udirana is severed, and only the arising of subtle lobha remains until the final time of the sukshmasampray gunasthan. 

Page #471:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karmapratyaya

At the final stage of the subtle sampraya gunasthan, the five types of knowledge-obscuring, the stream of darshan-obscuring, the five types of obstacles, fame and glory, and high lineage, these sixteen natures experience the severance of bondage and the arising and severance of the mohaniya. 

Thus, after explaining the order of the destruction of the mohaniya, the following verse is spoken to summarize the aforementioned meaning:

**Verse 64:**

"The purusha-ved is consumed by anger, anger by pride, pride by maya, maya by greed, and then even subtle greed is destroyed by its own arising."

**Explanation:**

The verse explains that the purusha-ved is consumed by anger, anger by pride, pride by maya, and maya by greed. Then, even subtle greed is destroyed by its own arising. This verse specifically highlights the order of destruction of the fourfold karma of anger, pride, maya, and greed.

**Comparison:**

"Anger, pride, maya, and greed are consumed by their own nature. Greed is consumed by subtle greed, which is consumed by its own nature." - Kashaya Paham, Sapna Adhikar 

Page #472:
---------------------------
434
When the bond etc. of the *samjvalana* *krodha* (anger) is broken, it transmigrates into the *samjvalana* *krodha* by means of *guna-samkramana* (transmigration of qualities). When the bond etc. of the *samjvalana* *kosa* (storehouse) is broken, it transmigrates into the *samjvalana* *mana* (mind). When the bond etc. of the *samjvalana* *mana* is broken, it transmigrates into the *samjvalana* *maya* (illusion). When the bond etc. of the *samjvalana* *maya* is broken, it transmigrates into the *samjvalana* *lobha* (greed). And when the bond etc. of the *samjvalana* *lobha* is broken, it destroys the subtle *kittigata* (minute) greed.

In this way, after the state of *samjvalana* *krodha* etc. *kashayas* (passions) is attained, the further state is explained as follows: When *lobha* is completely destroyed, then in the subsequent time, there is *kshinakashaya* (diminished passions). In the time of *kshinakashaya*, the majority of the *bhagas* (parts) of the *madhyasat* (middle seven) and the remaining *karma* (actions) continue to function as before. But when one *bhaga* remains, then the five *jnana-avaranas* (knowledge-obscurations), the *darshan-avaranas* (perception-obscurations), the five *antarayas* (hindrances), and the *nidra-dvig* (sleep-doubts), these sixteen *prakritis* (natures) are *apvartita* (refracted) by means of *sapi-vartana* (refraction) and made equal to the remaining time of *kshinakashaya*. Only the *nidra-dvig* remains for one less time than its own nature. Compared to ordinary *karma*, their state remains the same as the remaining *karma*. Although this time is a part of the entire time of *kshinakashaya*, its measure is *antar-muhurta* (a very short time). When their state becomes equal to the time of *kshinakashaya*, they do not have *sthiti-ghata* etc. functions, but the remaining *karma* do. Without the *nidra-dvig*, the remaining fourteen *prakritis* have both *udaya* (arising) and *udirana* (excitation) until one *avali-kala* (a very short time) remains. Afterwards, only *udaya* occurs for one *avali-kala*. *Kshinakashaya*... 

Page #473:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karma Group

**435**

In the penultimate moment, the essence of Nidravak decays in relation to the essence of the self, and in the final moment, the remaining four natures decay.

**Sri Naka Saya Charim Niha Pathla Pa Haga Baram Spo.**
**Bhavaranam Ansarae Param Spo Paribhasammi.**

After this, in the subsequent time, this being becomes a Sayogika Kevali, also known as a Jin, a Kevalajnani. Upon becoming a Sayogika Kevali, they become the complete knower and seer of the Lokaloka. There is no object in the universe, that has been, is, or will be, that the Jindev does not know. That is, they know and see everything.

**Sabhian Pasato Mogamalog Cha Sambho Sarth.**
**Masmin Pasa Bhuyan Bho Bhavis Cha.**

Thus, the Sayogika Kevali dwells for a period ranging from the shortest moment to a time slightly less than the previous koti, depending on their level of excellence.

Upon attaining the Sayogika Kevali state, the four Ghasikam - Jnana Avarana, Darsana Avarana, Mohaniya, and Antaraya - are completely destroyed. However, the remaining four Aghatik - Vedaniya, Ayu, Nama, and Gotra - remain.

Therefore, if the state of the remaining three karmas - Vedaniya, Nama, and Gotra - is greater than the state of the Ayu karma, then a Samudghat is performed at the end to bring their state equal to the state of the Ayu karma. If the state of the aforementioned three karmas is equal to the state of the Ayu karma, then no Samudghat is performed.

The Prajnapana Sutra states:

**Samve Vi Pan Bhanta! Kevali Samugdha Gati? Gorma! Modanastu Sam.**
**Jasaouam Tullai Bahin Hi Ya. Bhagoshaghamman Samugdhapan Sa Cha.**

## Chapter 436: The Sevenfold Emanation

**The Emanation of the Perfect Jina**

The emanation of the soul-regions from the body without abandoning the physical body is called **Samudghāt**. This emanation is of seven types: **Vedanasamudghāt**, **Kṣayāsamudghāt**, **Māraṇāntika Samudghāt**, **Tejasasamudghāt**, **Vakriya Samudghāt**, **Āhārakasamudghāt**, and **Kevalisamudghāt**.

Here are the brief characteristics of these seven types:

* **Vedanasamudghāt** is the emanation caused by intense pain.
* **Kṣayāsamudghāt** is the emanation caused by passions like anger.
* **Māraṇāntika Samudghāt** is the emanation that occurs before death.
* **Tejasasamudghāt** is the emanation that occurs for the creation of the **Tejas** body, which is capable of benefiting or destroying beings.
* **Vakriya Samudghāt** is the emanation that occurs for the creation of the **Vakriya** body.
* **Āhārakasamudghāt** is the emanation that occurs for the creation of the **Āhārak** body.
* **Kevalisamudghāt** is the emanation that occurs for the **Kevalajnani** (Perfect Knower) to equalize the state of the three non-destructive karmas (**Vedaniya**, **Āyaka**, and **Āyus** karmas) with the state of the **Āyaka** karma.

**Kevalisamudghāt** has eight stages:

* In the first stage, the soul-regions are spread out to the limits of the upper and lower realms, as large as the **Rava** body. This is called **Daṇḍasamudghāt**.
* In the second stage, the soul-regions are spread out in the east and west or south and north directions, like a **Kapāta** (door).
* In the third stage, the soul-regions are spread out in all eight directions, like a **Mathani** (churning stick).

## Sixth Karma Granth

It happens. In the fourth time, they fill the remaining space in the Lok. This is called the Lok-Puran state. After this Lok-Puran state is formed, in the fifth time, they contract and transform the Atma-Pradeshas into the form of a churn. In the sixth time, they contract the churn form state. In the seventh time, they contract the Kapata state again, and in the eighth time, they become situated in their own body.

This is the process of Kevali Samudghat. The process of Yoga-Nirodha
Those who attain Kevali Samudghat, after attaining Samudghat, and those who do not attain Samudghat, begin Yoga-Nirodha when the time for Yoga-Nirodha remains.

In this, first, they stop Badar Manoyog by Chadar Kayayog. Then, they stop Sadar Vachanayog. After this, they stop Badar Kayayog by Sukshma Kayayog. Then, they stop Sukshma Manoyog. Then, they stop Sukshma Vachanayog. Then, they stop Sukshma Kayayog and attain Sukshma Kriya-Pratipat Dhyan. By the power of this Dhyan, the Atma-Pradeshas contract and become without holes. In this Dhyan, they avert all the remaining Karmas that benefit Bhava except Ayukarma, until the last time of the Sayogik state, due to the Dwag Sayogik state, etc. As a result, at the last time of the Sayogik Kevali, the state of all Karmas becomes equal to the time of the Aayogik Kevali Gunasthan. Here, there is a special feature that the state of those Karmas which do not arise in the Aayogik Kevali becomes one time less than the state of the small, but less than the general...

## Translation:

438
The duration of the Aayogikevali Gunasthan is equal to the duration of the Sayogikevali Gunasthan.
At the end of the Sayogikevali Gunasthan, the following thirty types of Prakruti are destroyed:
One of the two, Saata or Asaata, Vedaniya, Audarikasharira, Tanjasasharira, Karmanasharira, six Sthana, the first Sanhan, Audarikangopang, Varnachatusk, Agurulghu, Upghāt, Parāghāt, Ucchvās, Shubhashubh Vihayogati, Pratiyaka, Sthira, Asthira, Shubh, Ashubh, Suswar, Duswar, and Nirman.
At the end of the Sayogikevali Gunasthan, by destroying the arising and stimulation of these thirty Prakruti, they become Aayogikevali in the subsequent time. The duration of the Aayogikevali Gunasthan is Antamuhurt. In this state, they practice Vyupratkriya-pratipadi Dhyana to destroy the Karmas that contribute to Bhava. There are no actions like Sthitighāt etc. But the Karmas that arise are destroyed by experiencing their full duration, and the Prakruti that do not arise are transferred to the existing Prakruti through Stibuksankrama, and they are experienced as existing Prakruti until the end of the Aayogikevali Gunasthan.
Now, in the next verse, we will explain the Prakruti that are destroyed at the end of the Aayogikevali Gunasthan.
Devgaisahgayao ducharam samaya bhaniya mmi khiyan ti. Savivaageyar nama niyago yam pi tatheva ||6||

##  Kar 6th Karma-prapa

**For a being who is about to attain the state of Aayogikevali, with only two lifetimes remaining, the following karmas are destroyed:**

* **Deva-gati:** The karmas that bind the being to the Deva-gati (heavenly realm).
* **Name-karma:** The karmas that are devoid of Vipaka (fruit) and are of the nature of Ni-cha-gotra (low birth) and one Vedaniya (pain).

**The **Vishesharm-gatha** mentions the karmas that are destroyed in the penultimate lifetime of the Aayogikevali state.**

**As previously explained, the karmas that do not arise in the Aayogikevali state are one lifetime less than the duration of the Aayogikevali state. Therefore, they are destroyed in the penultimate lifetime.**

**The karmas that are destroyed in the penultimate lifetime were not mentioned before, so this gatha clarifies that the karmas that bind to Deva-gati, the Name-karma that does not arise in the Aayogikevali state, and the Ni-cha-gotra and one Vedaniya are all destroyed in the penultimate lifetime.**

**The karmas that bind to Deva-gati are as follows:**

* Deva-gati
* Devanupurvi

## Chapter 440: The Sevenfold

**Bondage, Karma Aggregates, Six Institutions, Six Consolidations, Generous Limbs, Four Castes, Pre-Human Existence, Severe Injury, Minor Injury, Gross and Subtle, Auspicious and Inauspicious Paths of Liberation, Each, Insufficient, Exhalation, Stable, Unstable, Auspicious, Inauspicious, Good Voice, Bad Voice, Unfortunate, Unworthy, Bad Reputation, and Creation.**

In addition to these, there is one of the two Vedaniya Karmas, namely, the lower caste and the Saata and Asaata Vedaniya. In total, these are 10 + 45 + 2 = 57. These are destroyed in the penultimate time of the Aayogikevali state - *Ducharam Samaya Bhaviyammi Kheerhi*.

In the aforementioned 57 types, the four basic distinctions of color, smell, taste, and touch are considered in the four castes. There are no further distinctions within these. If, instead of these four basic distinctions of color, etc., their further distinctions are considered, then the number of types destroyed in the penultimate time becomes 73. Although the verse does not mention any Vedaniya Karma by name, the word "Pi" in the verse implies one of the two types of Vedaniya Karma.

Thus, after mentioning the types destroyed in the penultimate time of the Aayogikevali Gunasthan, the following verse describes the types that remain active until the final time.

**Annayara Veyaniyam Manuyauy Upchagoy Nav Name. Thae Aogijino Ukkoss Jahann Eshkaram. ||66||**

**Shabaap:** Annayara Veyaniyam - one of the two Vedaniya Karmas, Manuyauy - Manushyaayu, Andhagore - Uchchagotra, Nav Name - nine types of Naam Karma, declare this. Aogijino - Aayogi...

## Sixth Karma Granth

**Kevali Jin**, from the **Urkos-Uskrisht** (most excellent) to the **Jahan-Jaghanya** (most inferior), **Apakara**... eleven.

**Gathaarth:** The **Ayogik Jin**, in the most excellent form, experiences the **vedaniya** (afflictions) of one of the two **vedaniya**, **Manushyayu** (human lifespan), **Uchch Gotra** (high lineage), and the nine **prakritis** (natures) of **Namakarma** (name karma), thus experiencing twelve **prakritis** of **vedaniya**. In the most inferior form, they experience eleven **prakritis** of **vedaniya**.

**Visheshary:** In the **Ayogik Kevali** state, all **prakritis** of **karma** except a few are destroyed by the end of the **Gunasthan** (state of merit). The **prakritis** that are destroyed at the end are mentioned in this **Gatha** as one **vedaniya karma**, **Manushyayu**, **Uchch Gotra**, and nine **prakritis** of **Namakarma**.

Here (in the **Ayogik Kevali** state), the reason for the destruction of one **vedaniya** is that at the end of the thirteenth **Sayogik Kevali Gunasthan**, one of the two **vedaniya**, **Sata** (pleasant) and **Asata** (unpleasant), is destroyed. If **Sata** is destroyed, then the **Asata vedaniya** remains, and if **Asata** is destroyed, then the **Sata vedaniya** remains. This is indicated in the **Gatha** by the term "**Annyaraveyaniya**" - other **vedaniya**.

Furthermore, the reason for mentioning twelve **prakritis** in the most excellent form and eleven in the most inferior form is that not all beings experience the **Tirthankara** nature. Only those who have bound it experience the **Tirthankara** nature. Therefore, in the **Ayogik Kevali** state, a maximum of twelve **prakritis** and a minimum of eleven **prakritis** are considered to be experienced.

The twelve **prakritis** include the nine **prakritis** of **Namakarma**.

The chapter on the seven categories, therefore, now in the next section, we will tell the names of the nine types of name-karma that are eligible to arise in the ineligible state. Manuyaga-human birth, vaad-five sense organs, tasbaapar-pras badar, cha-and, parmatt-sufficient, subhagasumag, ai-adey, jasvitti-yaka koti, sitpary-tirthankar, namass-name-karma, harshati-are, mav-nine, epa-these.
   The verse states that human birth, five sense organs, pras badar, sufficient, auspicious, adey, fame, and tirthankar are the nine types of name-karma.
Special meaning- In the previous verse, it was indicated that the nine types of name-karma arise until the last moment of the ineligible kevali guna-sthana, but their names were not mentioned. Therefore, in this verse, the names of the aforementioned nine types of name-karma are mentioned as follows: 1. Human birth, 2. Five sense organs, 3. Ara, 4. Badar, 5. Sufficient, 6. Auspicious, 7. Adeg, 8. Fame, 9. Tirthankar. After mentioning the nine types of name-karma, the next verse discusses the difference of opinion regarding the arising of manushyanupurvi.

Kosam - In the most excellent way, in the victorious way, the Parsva Jinarah rejoices.
Gapaary - In the ultimate time of the liberated soul, there are thirteen natures in the most excellent way, including the human-like, and twelve natures in the most inferior way.
Special Meaning - This verse mentions a difference of opinion. Some Acharyas believe that the human-like nature also arises in the ultimate time of the Aayogi Kevali Gunasthan. Therefore, according to their opinion, there are thirteen natures in the ultimate time and twelve natures in the most inferior way.
It has been previously indicated that the natures which do not arise in the Aayogi state, their existence is severed in the penultimate time. The human-like nature arises only in the first, second, and fourth Gunasthanas, therefore it cannot arise in the Aayogi state. For this reason, its existence is said to be severed in the penultimate time of the Aayogi Kevali state. However, some other Acharyas believe that the human-like nature's existence is severed in the final time of the Aayogi state. Due to this difference of opinion, it is believed that there are thirteen natures in the ultimate time of the Aayogi state in the most excellent way, and twelve natures in the most inferior way. This difference of opinion is being explained in the following verse.
The summary of the above statement is that according to the opinion of the author of the Saptaatika, the human-like nature is destroyed in the penultimate time, resulting in the existence of twelve or eleven natures arising in the final time. However, according to the opinion of some Acharyas, the human-like nature still exists in the final time, therefore there are thirteen or twelve natures in the final time. 

Page #482:
---------------------------
## Chapter Seven

Now, in the next verse, we clarify the reason why other Acharyas believe in the existence of the Manushyanupurvi until the final moment. 

**Verse 6:**

*Manuyagaisahgayao bhavakhittavidhagajeevavaag ti. Beyagiyannarupace cha charim bhavisyas khiti.*

**Translation:**

The *Manuyagaisahgayao* - the *bhavalittavivag* (karma that ripens in the realm of existence), *kṣetravipaki* (karma that ripens in the realm of the body), and *jīvavaag* (karma that ripens in the soul) - are obtained along with the human birth. The *beyagiyannarupace* (one of the five vedaniya karmas) and the *uchva* (high gotra) are also obtained. These karmas are destroyed in the final moment of the *bhavyajīva* (a soul destined for liberation).

**Explanation:**

This verse states that the *Manuyagaisahgayao* - all the *bhavalittavipaki*, *kṣetravipaki*, and *jīvavaag* karmas, along with one of the five *vedaniya* karmas and a high *gotra*, are destroyed in the final moment of the *ayogikevali* (a soul who has attained liberation without any effort).

* **Bhavalittavipaki:** These karmas ripen in the realm of existence, such as the four *āyu* (life spans).
* **Kṣetravipaki:** These karmas ripen in the realm of the body, such as the four *ānupūrvi* (previous births).
* **Jīvavaag:** These karmas ripen in the soul, such as the five *jñānāvarana* (knowledge obscurations).

Here, the human lifespan is *bhavalittavipaki*, the *Manushyanupurvi* is *kṣetravipaki*, and... 

Page #483:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karma Granth, 445

The nine types of **Nama Karma** mentioned earlier are **Jiva-vipaki** (affecting the soul). In addition to these, there are two more types: **Vedaniya** (painful) and **Uchcha-gotra** (high lineage). Combining these two with the previous nine, we get a total of thirteen types of **Karma**. These thirteen types are destroyed at the final moment of the **Aghogikevali** (highest state of liberation) of a **Bhavasiddhik** (soul destined for liberation).

**Alternative View:**

The essence of the above statement, including the alternative view, is that **Manushyanupurvi** (karma related to human birth) arises only when the soul enters the **Manushya-Gati** (human realm). According to this rule, at the final moment of a **Bhavasiddhik** soul, twelve types of **Karma** are destroyed, excluding the **Manushyanupurvi** or the **Tirthankara** (liberated soul) type. However, according to this view, **Manushyanupurvi** is destroyed at the penultimate moment of the **Ayogikevali** (state of liberation) because it does not arise in the **Ayogikevali** state.

**Karma with Arising:**

The types of **Karma** that arise do not undergo **Stibukasankrama** (transition from one state to another). Therefore, their **Dalik** (subtle form) is visible at the final moment of their arising. This leads to their **Sattavichched** (cessation of existence) at the final moment.

**Four Anupurvi:**

The four **Anupurvi** (karma related to birth) are **Kshetravipaki** (affecting the body). They arise only in the **Apantaral** (intermediate) state. Therefore, they cannot arise in the **Bhavasiddhik** state. This is why **Manushyanupurvi** does not cease to exist at the final moment of the **Ayogikevali** state, but rather at the **Dvicharam** (second last) moment.

**Conclusion:**

The earlier statement about the cessation of existence of **Sattavan** (seven) types of **Karma** at the **Dvicharam** moment and the cessation of eleven types of **Karma** at the final moment, excluding the **Manushyanupurvi** or the **Tirthankara** type, is based on this view.

**Digambara Literature:**

The **Digambara** literature on **Karmakanda** (karma theory) also mentions a similar view, stating that **Manushyanupurvi** ceases to exist at the final moment of the **Maudahav** (state of liberation).

##  Translation:

**446**

After the complete destruction of karmas in the Sapta-tika stage, the soul attains the Siddha-sthana (state of liberation) through righteous conduct and upward movement in a single moment. As stated in the necessary commentary:

"Just as a boat is used to cross a river, so too is the soul used to attain liberation."

After mentioning the different views on the separation of the natures in the A-yogi state in the previous verse, the following verse explains the state of the pure soul free from karmas at the end of the A-yogi state.

**70**

"They experience the essence of the Triratna (three jewels), which is free from suffering, infinite, unobstructed, and the peak of happiness in the world, pure, all-pervading, free from disease, incomparable, natural, and eternal."

**Explanation:**

After the destruction of karmas, the soul experiences the essence of the Triratna, which is the peak of happiness in the world, pure, all-pervading, free from disease, incomparable, natural, and eternal.

**Special Note:**

The verse describes the state of the soul after the destruction of karmas, stating that it experiences happiness.

**Udayagabar Granth, verse 34:**

"But in the first book of the Pavala, both views are mentioned, similar to the Sapta-tika. See Dhavala, first book, page 224." 

Page #485:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karma Granth

Nine special qualities of the happiness attained after achieving the state of being beyond karma are given. The first quality is 'Su-iyam', which means pure. The commentator Acharya Malayagiri has defined 'Shuchik' as pure solitude. This means that the happiness attained by worldly beings is mixed with attachment and aversion, but the happiness attained by Siddha beings is completely devoid of attachment and aversion. Therefore, the happiness they experience arises from the pure soul, and it is not caused by external objects, their association or separation, or by desires and aversions.

The second quality is 'Sayal' - Sakal, which means complete. The reason why Moksha happiness is called complete is that in the worldly state, the beings remain connected to their karmas, which prevents them from attaining spiritual happiness. Even if they do attain spiritual happiness due to right faith, right knowledge, etc., it is limited and incomplete due to the presence of anxiety. However, since all obstacles are removed for Siddhas, they attain complete happiness arising from perfect liberation. This is why the quality 'Sayal' is used.

The third quality is 'Jag Sih' - Jag Shikhar, which means that the happiness of Siddha beings is the highest among all happiness in the world. Because happiness is one of the infinite inherent qualities of the soul. As long as this being remains in the world, this quality remains suppressed. Even if it manifests, it manifests only partially. But when the obstacles for Siddha beings are removed, the quality of happiness manifests in its full form. Therefore, the happiness of Siddha beings is the highest among all types of happiness in the world. 

Page #486:
---------------------------
44%
The chapter of the Sapttatika is primarily about happiness, and this is made clear by the Jagashikhar epithet. The fourth epithet is 'Aruy' - free from disease. This means that there is not even a trace of disease in that happiness. Because the origin of diseases and other defects comes from the body, and where there is a body, there is bound to be the origin of disease, 'Shariram Vyadhimndiram'. But Siddha Jivas are without bodies, their karma that caused them to obtain a body has also been removed, therefore the happiness of Siddha Jivas is free from diseases and other defects. 
The fifth epithet for the happiness of Siddha Jivas is 'Nirukm' - without comparison. The reason for this is that 'Up' - from above or from nearness, the process of measuring is called 'Upma'. The meaning of this is that the qualities, dharma and synonyms of each thing are different from the qualities, dharma and synonyms of another thing, therefore the process of making its knowledge known through an example by looking at a little similarity is called 'Upma'. But this process can only happen in things that are perceivable by the senses, and the happiness of the Siddha Parameshti is beyond the senses, therefore it cannot be explained through 'Upma'. There is no such thing in the world that can be compared to it, therefore the happiness of the Siddha Parameshti is called 'Anupam'.
The sixth epithet is 'Svaabhavbhoot Sahaav'. The meaning of this is that worldly happiness is produced by the means of soft touch, delicious food, the fragrance of various types of flowers, perfumes, oils etc. that make the atmosphere fragrant, the sight of beautiful forms, sweet music etc., but this is not the case with Siddha happiness, it is the nature of the soul, it is not produced by the combination of external desirable and pleasing things. 

Page #487:
---------------------------
## Sixth Karma Granth

**446. Seventh Adjective: 'Anihanam' - Undying**

This means that after attaining the state of Siddha, it never perishes. Its inherent infinite qualities remain eternally stable by nature. Happiness is also one of these qualities, therefore it never perishes.

**Eighth Adjective: 'Adhabaah' - Uninterrupted**

This means that it is free from obstacles, there is no gap or interruption from any source. Obstacles arise in that which is caused by others or is temporary. However, the happiness of Siddha beings is neither caused by others nor is it temporary. It is the inherent nature of the soul and an eternal, ever-present Dharma. Therefore, it is called uninterrupted.

**Final - Ninth Adjective: 'Tirmanasar' - Essence of the Three Jewels**

This means that Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct are the three jewels, known as the Triratna. The happiness attained by Siddhas is their essence. Because Right Faith, etc., are the cause of karma destruction, and after karma destruction, Siddha happiness is attained. Therefore, Siddha happiness is called the essence of the Triratna.

Samsaric beings worship the Triratna, which is in the form of Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct, so that they can attain the state of freedom from suffering. The expression of happiness lies in freedom from suffering. Therefore, the happiness attained by Siddhas is described as the essence of the Triratna.

Attaining the true nature of the soul is the goal of all living beings, and karma is the obstacle to attaining that nature. After the destruction of karma, there is nothing else left to attain. The text describes the various states of karma, the means of its destruction, and after karma destruction...

The complete discussion of the self-realization obtained from the Saptaatika chapter has been done. Therefore, now the author says a verse to conclude the book:

**Verse 71:**
Difficult to comprehend, subtle, with the ultimate meaning, four-fold, delightful, with many divisions, and with the perspective of the eye, this is the meaning of the verse. 
The meaning of the verse is that the perspective of the eye is difficult to comprehend, subtle, with the ultimate meaning, delightful, and with many divisions. Those who want to know the special meaning of the bonds, arising, and existence of karma should know all this from it. 
**Special meaning:** The verse concludes the book by stating that this Saptaatika book is written based on the perspective of the eye. Thus, after indicating the authenticity of the book, it is stated that the perspective of the eye is difficult to comprehend, not everyone can understand it easily. But those who have a subtle intellect, who are curious to know subtle things, are the only ones who can enter it. The reason for calling the perspective of the eye difficult to comprehend is that although it presents the true meaning beautifully and logically, there are many divisions and subdivisions, which is why it is difficult to understand. Based on what can be known by churning it with one's own intellect,

## Sixth Karma Granth

This Granth has been composed, but those who are particularly inquisitive should study the Dristivad Anga, and from it, understand the distinctions of karma in terms of bondage, arising, and existence. The Granth called Graha Saptathika is like a guide for them.

Now, after directing towards the authenticity, basis, etc. of the Granth, the author, acknowledging his limitations, concludes the Granth with a gatha:

**"Jo jasma aparaipuno attho appagameṇa baddo ti. Tam khamiūṇ bahusuyā pūreūrg parikahantu." (72)**

**Explanation:**

* **Jo:** Where
* **Jasma:** In which
* **Aparaipuno:** Incomplete
* **Attho:** Meaning
* **Appagameṇa:** By the limited knowledge of the Agamas
* **Baddo ti:** Has been bound
* **Tam:** That
* **Khamiūṇ:** By forgiving
* **Bahusuyā:** The learned
* **Pūreūrg:** Should complete
* **Parikahantu:** The explanation

**Gatha:**

I am a limited knower of the Agamas, therefore, whatever incomplete meaning I have bound in this chapter, is my fault, my oversight. Therefore, the learned should forgive my fault and oversight, and complete the meaning while explaining it.

**Commentary:**

In this gatha, the author, acknowledging his limitations, states that he is neither a scholar nor a learned person, but a limited knower. Therefore, he does not claim that the Granth has been able to fully express the specific meaning. It is possible that due to his limited knowledge, he may not have been able to fully fulfill the intention of presenting the subject matter in this Granth. For this, he apologizes.

This chapter on the seven categories is the cause, and there may be some errors here and there. But those who are learned should forgive my faults and, while filling in any gaps, should continue to speak in this way. This is my humble request.

Appendix-1
Two sixes, eight fours, but nine ones, six ones arise. There are five ones, eleven fours, in the Nirjara. ||51||
All these are destroyed, but five and eight are the remaining ones. But six ones arise, and twelve are the remaining ones. ||52||
These are the karmic stains, the place of the good, the place of the bad, and the place of the mixed. They are to be known by the fourfold division. ||53||
There is no difference in the samittas for the destruction of the old. The samittas are the fourfold division, the knowledge, the destruction of the obstacles, the seeing, and the non-seeing. ||54||
The samittas are the greed, the hatred, the delusion, the name, the fame, and the pride. ||55||
The samittas are the attachment to the body, the attachment to the senses, the attachment to the world, the attachment to the self, the attachment to the knowledge, the attachment to the liberation,
