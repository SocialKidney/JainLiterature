The **Prakashkiy Ardhamagadhi Jain Agam-Sahitya** is an invaluable treasure of Indian culture and literature. Unfortunately, due to the lack of available translations of these texts, both the general public and scholars are unfamiliar with them. Many of the Agam texts, though ancient and spiritually profound, have remained inaccessible. It is our good fortune that the original texts of these scattered texts, edited by the revered Muni Shri Punyavijayji, have been published by the Shri Mahavira Jain Vidyalaya, Bombay. However, due to the lack of translations, they have not become accessible to the general public. For this reason, the Coordination Committee of Jain Vidya scholars decided to prioritize the publication of translated Agam texts and commentaries. In this context, the task of translating the scattered texts was given to the Agam Institute. The Institute has so far published three scattered texts, namely **Devendrastava**, **Tandulavaicharaka**, and **Chandravedhyaka**, along with their translations.

We are pleased to announce that Shri Suresh Sisodiya, Associate Research Officer of the Institute, has completed the translation of **"Mahapratyakhyan-Prakirnak"**. The present book has been enriched by the detailed and thoughtful introduction written by Professor Sagarmalji Jain, Honorary Director of the Institute, and Shri Suresh Sisodiya. We are grateful to them for their contribution. We are also grateful to Professor Kamalchandji Sogani, Honorary Co-Director, Dr. Sushmaji Singhavi, Honorary Co-Director, and Shri Virendra Singhji Lodha, Minister, who are providing all possible support and guidance in the development of the Institute. Dr. Subhash Kothari is also involved in the Institute's scattered text translation project, and we are grateful to him.

On this occasion of publication, we also express our gratitude to the officials of the Parshvanath Vidyalaya Research Institute, Varanasi, who provided ample facilities and support during the printing of this book in Varanasi.

## Introduction

In every religious tradition, sacred texts hold a significant place. Just as the Vedas are important for Hindus, the Tripitaka for Buddhists, the Avesta for Parsis, the Bible for Christians, and the Quran for Muslims, the **Agam literature** holds the same position and importance for Jains. 

Although the **Agam** in the Jain tradition are not considered **apaurusheya** like the Vedas, nor are they considered divine messages delivered through a prophet like the Bible and the Quran, they are a compilation of the words of **Arhats** and **Rishis** who attained the light of truth through their spiritual practices and purity. 

While the **Angasutras** in Jain **Agam** literature are attributed to the **Tirthankaras**, we must remember that the **Tirthankaras** are merely the speakers of the meaning. In other words, they present thoughts or ideas, which are then given a verbal form by the **Ganadharas** or other enlightened **Acharyas** or **Sthaviras** to create the text.

The Jain tradition, unlike the Hindu tradition, does not place as much emphasis on words. It considers words as merely a means of expressing thought. In its view, it is not the word but the meaning (**tatparya**) that is paramount. Due to this lack of emphasis on words, the **Agam** texts of the Jain tradition have undergone linguistic changes over time and have not remained intact in their verbal form like the Vedas. This is why the Jain **Agam** literature later divided into two branches: **Ardhamagadhi Agam literature** and **Shourseni Agam literature**. 

The **Ardhamagadhi Agam literature** is not only older but also closer to the original teachings of Mahavira. The development of **Shourseni Agam literature** is also based on these ancient **Agam** texts of the **Ardhamagadhi Agam literature**. Therefore, **Ardhamagadhi Agam literature** is the foundation of **Shourseni Agam literature** and is also older than it. 

Although this **Ardhamagadhi Agam literature** is also... 1. '**Attham bhasai araha sutam ganthanti ganha - Aavashyakaniyukti, Gatha 92**.

Page #11:
---------------------------
The **Mahapaccakkhannapainnāya** has been compiled and edited over a long period of about a thousand years, from the time of Mahavira to the Valabhi reading of **Veer Nirvan Samvat 980** or **993**. Therefore, some revisions, changes, and additions have also been made in it during this period.

In ancient times, this **Ardhamagadhi** **Agam** literature was divided into two sections: **Ang-Pravist** and **Ang-Bahya**. The **Ang-Pravist** included eleven **Ang** **Agams** and the twelfth **Dristivad**. While the **Ang-Bahya** included all those **Agam** texts in addition to these, which were considered to be the creations of **Shrutakevali** and **Purvadhar** **Sthaviras**. Again, this **Ang-Bahya** **Agam** literature has also been divided into two parts in the **Nandi Sutra**: **Aavashyak** and **Aavashyak Vyatirikt**. The **Aavashyak Vyatirikt** has also been divided into two parts: **Kalik** and **Utkalik**. This classification of the **Nandi Sutra** is as follows:

**Shruta (Agam)**
**Ang-Pravist**
**Ang-Bahya**
**Aavashyak**
**Aavashyak Vyatirikt**
**Acharaang Sutra**
**Krtaang**
**Sthanaang**
**Samavaayaang**
**Vyakhya Prajnapti**
**Jnata Dharma Katha**
**Upasak Dashaang**
**Antakrit Dashaang**
**Anuttaroupapattik Dashaang**
**Prashna Vyakaran**
**Vipak Sutra**
**Dristivad**
**Samayik**
**Chaturvinshati Stav**
**Vandana**
**Pratikraman**
**Kayotsarg**
**Pratyakhyan**

Thus, we see that the Mahāpratyākhyāna is mentioned in the Nandī Sūtra as an Angabāhya, Āvashyak-Vyatirikt Utkalik Āgama. The style of classification of Āgamas adopted in the Pākshika Sūtra has some differences in name and order. In it too, the Mahāpratyākhyāna has been placed 28th among the Utkalik Āgamas. In addition, an ancient style of classification of Āgamas is also found in the Shourseni Āgama 'Mūlāchār' of the Yāpanīya tradition. The Mūlāchār classifies Āgamas into four parts: (1) Tīrthankara-Katha (2) Pratyekabuddha 1. Mūlāchār-Bharatiya Jñānapīṭha-Gāthā 277

Page #13:
---------------------------
The **Mahapatalpainnayan** is said to be (3) **Shruta-kevali**-said and (4) **Purvadhara**-said. Again, in **Moolachar**, these **Agamic** texts are classified as **Kalik** and **Utkalik**, but the name **Mahapratyakhyan** does not appear anywhere in **Moolachar**. Therefore, it is difficult to say in which category the **Yapaneya** tradition classified it.

Currently, the **Agamas** are divided into **Anga**, **Upanga**, **Cheda**, **Moolasutra**, **Prakirnak**, etc. This division is first found in **Vidhimargprapa** (Jinaprabha - 13th century). Generally, the meaning of **Prakirnak** is a collection of texts on various subjects. **Malayagiri**, the commentator of **Nandosootra**, has written that **Shramanas** used to compose **Prakirnakas** by following the **Shruta** taught by the **Tirthankaras**. According to tradition, it is also believed that each **Shramana** composed one **Prakirnak**. The **Samavayanga Sutra** mentions eighty-four thousand **Prakirnakas** of eighty-four thousand disciples of **Rishabhdev** by saying "**Choraasiin Pannag Sahassaain Pannaatta**". In **Mahavira**'s **Tirtha**, mention of fourteen thousand monks is found. Therefore, the number of **Prakirnakas** in his **Tirtha** is also considered to be fourteen thousand. But today, the number of **Prakirnakas** is considered to be ten.

These ten **Prakirnakas** are as follows:
(1) **Chatuhsharan** (2) **Atur Pratyakhyan** (3) **Sanstarak** (4) **Chandravedhyak** (5) **Gachhachar** (6) **Tandulavaicharik** (7) **Devendrastav** (8) **Ganividya** (9) **Mahapratyakhyan** and (10) **Maran Vidhi**.

In **Painnayasuttaim** edited by Muni Punyavijayji, the names of the ten **Prakirnakas** are as follows:
(1) **Chatuhsharan** (2) **Aturpratyakhyan** (3) **Bhaktaparijna** (4) **Sanstarak** (5) **Tandulavaicharik** (6) **Chandravedhyak** (7) **Devendrastav** (8) **Ganividya** (9) **Mahapratyakhyan** and (10) **Virastav**.

The **Shwetamber Martipujak** sect considers these ten **Prakirnakas** to be in the category of **Agamas**. But if a collection of these texts called by the name **Prakirnak** is made, then the following twenty-two names are obtained:
1. **Vidhimargprapa** - Page 55. 2. **Samavayanga Sutra** - Muni Madhukar - 84th Samavay. 3. **Painnayasuttaai**, Introduction Page 20.

Page #14:

(1) Chatursharana (2) Aturpratyakhyana (3) Bhaktaparijna (4) Sanstharak (5) Tandulavaicharik (6) Chandravedhyak (7) Devendrastav (8) Ganividya (9) Mahapratyakhyana (10) Virastav (11) Rishibhashit (12) Ajiva Kalp (13) Gachchachar (14) Maranasamadhi (15) Titthogali (16) Aradhanapataka (17) Dvipasagaraprajnapti (18) Jyotishkarandak (19) Angavidya (20) Siddapramrit (21) Saravali and (22) Jova Vibhakti.

In addition to these, there are many scattered texts with the same name, such as three texts available under the name 'Aur Pacchakkhan'. Of these, seven names - Devendrastav, Tandulavaicharik, Chandravedhyak, Ganividya, Maranavibhakti, Maranasamadhi, Mahapratyakhyana - are found in the category of Uttalik Sutras of Nandi and Paakshik, and two names - Rishibhashit and Dvipasagaraprajnapti - are found in the category of Kalik Sutras. Thus, nine scattered texts are mentioned in Nandi and Paakshik Sutras.

Although there is a difference of opinion regarding the number and names of scattered texts, it is certain that Mahapratyakhyana has been given a place in all the different classifications of scattered texts.

Although the place of scattered texts in the series of Agamas is secondary, if we consider from the point of view of linguistic antiquity and spiritual-dominant subject matter, scattered texts seem more important than some Agamas. In scattered texts, there are scattered texts like Rishibhashit, etc., which are older than even ancient level Agamas like Uttaradhyayanasutra and Dashakalika.

Mahapratyakhyana-Prakirnak
Mahapratyakhyana-Prakirnak (Mahapacchakkhana-Painnayam) is a poetic composition in Prakrit language. Its first mention is found in Nandi Sutra and Paakshik Sutra. Both the texts mention 'Mahapratyakhyana' under the category of 'Uttalik Shruta' which is necessary-extra. 1. Painnayassuttai, page 18. 2. Nandi Sutra Madhukar Muni, page 80-81. 3. Regarding the antiquity of Rishibhashit etc., see Dr. Sagarmal Jain-Rishibhashit Ek Adhyayan (Prakrit Bharati Sansthan, Jaipur). 4. (a) Ukkaliam Anegavihm Pannaatam Tam Jaha-(1) Dasaveaaliam"

Page #15:
---------------------------
The **Mahapāñcakkhāṇapaiṇṇaya** (Great Fivefold Renunciation) is described in the **Pākṣika Sūtra Vṛtti** as follows: "**Mahāpratyākhyānam** (Great Renunciation) is the state where **sthavirakalpika** (those who have reached the stage of old age) are unable to continue their **vihāra** (wandering) and perform **anashanauccāra** (fasting unto death) at the end of their lives. This is all described in detail in the **Mahāpratyākhyānam**." Thus, the **Pākṣika Sūtra Vṛtti** only mentions the **samādhimaraṇa** (death by meditation) of **sthavirakalpika**s. It does not discuss how **jīnakalpika**s (those who have reached the stage of liberation) accept **samādhimaraṇa**.

The **Nandī Sūtra Cūrṇi** describes **Mahāpratyākhyānam** as follows: "**Therakappeṇaṁ** (those who have reached the stage of old age) or **jiṇakappeṇaṁ** (those who have reached the stage of liberation) who have been wandering, the **therakappiya**s (those who have reached the stage of old age) perform **sanlehaṁ** (renunciation) after twelve years of **sthiravāsa** (stationary dwelling), while the **jiṇakappiya**s (those who have reached the stage of liberation) perform **sanlehaṁ** (renunciation) while still wandering, when the appropriate time arrives. They renounce all **bhavacarim** (worldly attachments) with unwavering effort and **paccākvaṁti** (renounce) all **āhāradi** (food and drink) until death. This is all described in detail in the **Mahāpratyākhyānam**."

This explanation from the **Nandī Cūrṇi** suggests that there was a difference in the **sanlehaṇa** (renunciation) practices of **sthavirakalpika**s and **jīnakalpika**s at that time. **Sthavirakalpika**s, knowing their old age, would stop their **vihāra** (wandering) and perform **sanlehaṇa** (renunciation) over a long period of twelve years, gradually renouncing **āhāradi** (food and drink) while dwelling in one place. This also implies that they would gradually reduce their **āhāradi** (food and drink) intake.

Page #16:
---------------------------
## Introduction

The Jain ascetics (Jinkalpi) continuously wandered, while the stationary ascetics (Sthavirakalpi) progressed towards complete renunciation of food and other necessities. When the Jinkalpi felt that wandering was no longer possible, they would accept Sanlekhana (voluntary death by fasting) after renouncing food and other necessities. This fact is confirmed by the current Sanlekhana practices of the Svetambara and Digambara traditions.

According to the Digambara tradition, when a monk becomes unable to wander, even to the point where begging for food is no longer possible, he accepts Sanlekhana. This is because in this tradition, there is no practice of accepting food brought by others. In contrast, according to the Svetambara tradition, monks become stationary in old age and gradually reduce their intake of food and other necessities, eventually accepting Sanlekhana. However, it is important to note that not all monks reduce their intake of food and other necessities after becoming stationary.

The different Sanlekhana practices described for Sthavirakalpi and Jinkalpi in the Nandi Churna seem appropriate considering the practices of these two types of ascetics. Even today, Digambara monks follow the Jinkalpi practice in some form, while Svetambara monks are closer to the Sthavirakalpi practice. It is a separate matter that the practice of Sanlekhana after twelve years is no longer prevalent, but this practice is mentioned in the Bhagavati Aradhana, a text accepted by the Digambara tradition. The Yapaniya tradition even allows for the acceptance of food brought by others in exceptional circumstances. The Bhagavati Aradhana explicitly mentions that four monks should bring food and other necessities for the monk performing Sanlekhana, and four other monks should protect that food and other necessities. Thus, both Sthavirakalpi and Jinkalpi practices are mentioned in the Yapaniya tradition.

## Significance of the Name

This work is called Mahapratyakhyana. In scattered texts, both Mahapratyakhyana and Aturpratyakhyana are mentioned as texts on Samadhi-marana (death by meditation).

1. Bhagavati Aradhana, verse 254.
2. Ibid., verses 661-663.

Page #17:
---------------------------
This is related to the concept of **Mahaprayakhyana**. The literal meaning of the word **Mahaprayakhyana** is the greatest renunciation. **Prayakhyana** means renunciation. Accordingly, the greatest renunciation is called **Mahaprayakhyana**. If there is any greatest renunciation in a person's life, it is the renunciation of the body. Renunciation of the body with **Prayakhyana** is called **Samadhimaran**. This work is named **Mahaprayakhyana** because of the special mention of **Samadhimaran**. The way **Samadhimaran** is mentioned in **Nandichurni** and **Paakshikasutra** while introducing **Mahaprayakhyana**, it becomes clear that **Mahaprayakhyana** is related to **Samadhimaran**.

There are many other texts besides **Mahaprayakhyana** in the texts related to **Samadhimaran**, such as **Aturprayakhyana**, **Maranavibhakti**, **Maranasamadhi**, **Maranavishuddhi**, **Sanlekhanashruta**, **Bhaktaparijna** and **Aradhana**, etc. All these texts related to **Samadhimaran** have been compiled into one text and named **Maranavibhakti**. The available **Maranavibhakti** contains eight texts: **Maranavibhakti**, **Maranasamadhi**, **Maranavishuddhi**, **Sanlekhanashruta**, **Bhaktaparijna**, **Aturprayakhyana**, **Mahaprayakhyana** and **Aradhana**. Out of these eight texts, the names of **Maranavibhakti**, **Maranasamadhi**, **Sanlekhanashruta**, **Bhaktaparijna**, **Aturprayakhyana** and **Mahaprayakhyana** are found in the **Nandi Sutra** and its **Churni**. But the names of the remaining two texts, **Maranavishuddhi** and **Aradhana**, are not available in the **Nandi Sutra** and its **Churni**. The inclusion of **Mahaprayakhyana** in **Maranavibhakti** indicates that it is a work related to **Samadhimaran**. The name **Mahaprayakhyana** of the text is also meaningful because it emphasizes the renunciation of the body, which is the root center of the creature's **ragatmatva** or attachment. In fact, in this sense, this text is called **Mahaprayakhyana**.

The question of the validity of **Prakirnaka** is accepted as **Agam** by both the **Shwetambar** tradition, which believes in 84 **Agam**, and the tradition, which believes in 45 **Agam**. But the **Sthanakvasi** and **Terapanthi** traditions, which only accept 32 **Agam**, have accepted ten **Prakirnaka**, **Jitakalp**, 1. (a) **Nandi Sutra** 80.
(b) **Nandi Sutra** 80, **Churni** page 58.

Page #18:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**The two traditions have rejected thirteen Agam texts, including Gopaniyukti and Mahanishith, and accepted only 32 out of 45 Agams. The reasons given by both traditions for rejecting the Prakiranakas and three other texts as Agams are that these texts contain many statements that contradict the original Agams and their traditional beliefs.**

**Muni Kishnalalji has mentioned the following reasons for rejecting the Prakiranakas:**

1. **"In Aurarpacchakkhana, Gatha 8, the right of Panditmaran is mentioned. In Gatha 31, there is an order to use wealth (parigraha) in seven places. In Gatha 30, there are instructions for Guru Puja, Samini Bhakti, and seven other things. Aurarpacchakkhana is a witness, but its name is not mentioned in Bhattapainna. The use of Savadya (sinful) language cannot be used in the Sutra, therefore it is invalid."**

2. **"In Ganivjja Painne, there is also a description of astrology. For example, initiation should not be taken in the three constellations of Shravana, Dhaneshta, and Punarvasu (Gatha 22). But in the Agams, it is mentioned that 20 Tirthankaras took initiation in the Shravana constellation. How can something be considered valid if it prohibits what is considered valid in the Agam? What can be its basis? Further, it is mentioned there that one should not serve the Guru in certain constellations, and one should not perform lunchan in certain constellations. All these things are not approved in the Agam. Therefore, they are not considered valid."**

3. **"The discussion about Santhan in Tandalveyaliyam is different from the instructions mentioned in the Agams. They do not match each other. It is written there that the final Sanhanan and Santhan of a human being occurs in the fifth Aare. In other Agams, it is mentioned that there are only six Santhan Sanhanan found in humans. How can Tandalveyaliyam be considered valid due to this contradiction? Such unauthentic statements are mentioned in Chandagavijjhay, Gatha 98, about the excellence of a Sadhu."**

**1. Authentic number of Agams: Jayacharyakrit Vivechan-Tulsiprajna-Khand 16, Issue 1 (June 1990)**

Page #19:
---------------------------
"The Mahapacchakkhaṇappaiṇṇaya mentions three bhavās, while other Āgamas believe that liberation is attained in the fifteen excellent bhavās."
4. "In the Devindastava, a woman is addressed as 'Aho Sundari!' while in the Ācārāṅga, a woman is addressed as 'Bahin'. The address 'Sundari' is not appropriate."
5. "In the Mahapacchakkhaṇagāthā 62, it is stated that Devendra and Chakravartitva have been attained by all beings an infinite number of times. It is not possible for every being to attain Chakravartitva an infinite number of times. This statement contradicts the Āgamas and cannot be accepted."

Thus, we see here that the Muni has attempted to show that all the Prakirṇakas contradict the Āgamas by citing some statements from the Āturpratyākhyāna, Gaṇividya, Tandalavaicārika, Chandraveḍhya, Devindastava, and Mahapratyākhyāna. The arguments given by the Muni to invalidate the Chandraveḍhya and Tandalavaicārika are not supported by any references from the Āgamas. How can the authenticity of his statements be accepted in the absence of references?

His objection to the Devindastava is not of much significance, because there, not a Muni but a Śrāvaka has called his wife 'Sundari'. Moreover, the word 'Sundari' is also found in the Upāsakadāśāṅga and Bhagavatisūtra, etc. Āgamas.

Regarding the Āturpratyākhyāna, Gaṇividya, and Mahapratyākhyāna, we would like to refute the objections raised by the Muni, as far as possible. The Muni's objection to the Āturpratyākhyāna is that it orders the use of wealth in seven places. This statement is invalid because it is cautious. We do not understand how the use of wealth in Guru Bhakti, Sārṁika Bhakti, etc. is cautious. Even if food, etc. is not prepared for the Muni for a specific purpose, the use of wealth is involved in the donations given to them.

... This is the role. Without wealth, food, clothing, and the tools of a monk's life cannot be obtained. Again, the mention of preaching, devotion, and the affection of the righteous is also found in the *Jñatadharmakathā* in the context of acquiring the *Tīrthankara* name-karma.  'The donation of food, clothing, etc. is also considered to be virtuous.' In support of this statement, we would like to say that the *Āgama* texts mention the giving of donations by the *Tīrthankaras* before taking initiation. 2. We would like to know from the monk whether the donation given by a *Tīrthankara* is without the use of wealth? Is it mindful? It is understandable that a sadhu does not speak mindlessly, but how can it be accepted that he does not make the householder aware of his duties of donation, etc.? We do not understand how the monk has tried to invalidate the *sārṁika-bhakti* etc., merely by mentioning the four *cāritra* qualities like *ātūrapratyākhyāna* and the *prakiṛṇaka* which is primarily about *sādhanā*.

The monk has given the argument for rejecting *gaṇividyā* that it states that initiation, *keśaloca*, and service to the guru should not be performed in certain specific constellations. Further, the monk has also written that *gaṇividyā* prohibits initiation in the *Śravaṇa* constellation, while the monk says, "There is mention in the *Āgamas* that 20 *Tīrthankaras* took initiation in the *Śravaṇa* constellation. How can that which prohibits something be accepted when the *Āgamas* accept that action?" We would like to ask the monk which *Āgama* text among the 32 *Āgamas* accepted by him mentions that the initiation of 20 *Tīrthankaras* took place in the *Śravaṇa* constellation. We do not know on what basis the monk has made this statement. If he were to give *āgamika* evidence, then this matter could be further considered. The discussion of the constellation, etc., of initiation is found only in later texts, not in the *Āgamas*. At least in the 32 *Āgamas*, there is no such statement. Here we would like to say one more thing: although there may not be mention of constellations, etc., for initiation, *keśaloca*, etc., in a theoretical sense, as far as we know, whether it be the *sthānakavāsī*, the *terāpanthī*, or any other tradition,

The Mahapachchama-innay is a great rejection, in practice everyone observes and follows the auspicious time for initiation, etc.
The present text, Mahapratyakhyan, has been rejected by Muni Ji due to the reason given in the 62nd verse of this text, as stated by Jayacharya. The essence of this verse is that this being has enjoyed the supreme pleasures of Devenndra, Chakravartitva and kingdoms for an infinite number of times, yet it has not been satisfied. In this regard, Muni Ji says, "In this verse, it is stated that all beings have attained Devenndra and Chakravartitva for an infinite number of times. Every being cannot attain Chakravartitva for an infinite number of times. This statement is against the Agamas, it cannot be accepted." In this regard, our submission is that firstly, this statement is not for all beings, as Muni Ji has said. In the original verse, it is nowhere explicitly written that every being can attain Chakravartitva for an infinite number of times, and secondly, this is a didactic verse, its purpose is only to show that this being has not been satisfied even after attaining the best pleasures many times. It is not appropriate to take this general statement in a meaning contrary to its spirit. An Indian is poor - this is a general statement, it would not be appropriate to take it to mean that no Indian is wealthy.
Muni Ji, in his statement, has used the words 'all beings' once and 'every being' another time, emphasizing each word specifically, only then has he declared this text invalid. In our opinion, Muni Ji's misconception arose due to his inability to understand the word 'patta' written in this verse correctly, possibly Muni Ji has interpreted the word 'patta' as 'every'. In fact, the word 'patta' does not mean 'every' but 'obtained'. If the word 'patta' is interpreted in this way here, then Muni Ji would not have had such a misconception.
Here we would like to clarify one more thing, that is, all the statements in the Agamic texts are relative. No Jina-vchan is absolute. If the Agamas are interpreted from an absolute perspective, then even in the thirty-two Agamas which the Sthanakvasi and Terapanthi sects consider authentic, many such inconsistencies can be seen which will be considered against their tradition. The reality is that...

Page #22:
---------------------------
Initially, the Lokashah, the followers of the Sthanakvasi tradition, had access to only thirty-two Agamas. Therefore, they accepted only these thirty-two Agamas as authoritative. Once they accepted these thirty-two Agamas, there was no question of changing them. Hence, even when the Prakirnaks became available later, they were not accepted as Agamas.

While some Prakirnaks like Tithogali and Ganividya may contain statements that differ slightly from their tradition, it is not appropriate to reject the entire Prakirnak literature. If we were to do so, we would also have to reject many Agama texts, as they contain even more statements that contradict their beliefs than these Prakirnaks. The Suryaprajnapti contains more cautious teachings than the Ganividya. And as far as the question of statements differing from traditions is concerned, the Agamas contain more references to images and worship than the Prakirnaks. Would we then refuse to accept the Sthananga Sutra, Jnatadharmakatha, and Rajaprashniya, etc., as Agamas because they contain such references? The mistake that the Digambara monks made in rejecting the Svetambara Agama literature is probably the same mistake that the Sthanakvasi and Terapanthi are making by rejecting the Prakirnaks. The unfortunate consequence of this is that the Sthanakvasi and Terapanthi communities have been deprived of this vast treasure of knowledge, which is purely instructive, focused on austerity, and emphasizes character. We should instead focus on how these texts contribute to the development of human spiritual, devotional, and ethical values. If, after studying them, we find that they contain useful material, then, despite some differences in beliefs, we should accept them as Agamas and promote their study and teaching.

Introduction to the Manuscript Copies Used in the Mahapratyakhyanamanapainnay

Muni Shri Punyavijayaji used the following manuscripts in determining the text of this work:

1. Saṅ: Manuscript on palm leaves from the Jain Gyan Bhandar in Sanghvipada.
2. Pu.: Manuscript written by Muni Shri Punyavijayaji Maharaj.
3. Sa.: Manuscript edited by Acharya Sagarnandasuriśvara.
4. Haṅ: Manuscript written by Muni Shri Hansavijayaji Maharaj.

We have taken the textual variations of these manuscripts, numbered 1 to 4, from the work *Paṇṇayasuttaī* edited by Muni Punyavijayaji. For detailed information about these manuscripts, we recommend that readers refer to pages 23-27 of the introduction to the *Paṇṇayasuttaī* work.

**Thoughts on the Author and Time of Composition**

Although the Mahapratyakhyan is mentioned in many works like the Nandīsutr, Pākṣikasūtr, etc., no information is available about the author of this work. Based on the clues we have, we can only say that it is a work of some *sthavira ācārya* from the 5th century CE or earlier. It is difficult to say anything more about the author because no clues are available in the form of any sūtra.

However, as far as the time of composition of this work is concerned, it can be said with certainty that it was composed before the 5th century CE. This is because the Mahapratyakhyan is mentioned in the Nandīsutr and Pākṣikasūtr, as well as in the Nandīcūṛṇi, etc. The subject matter of this work is also briefly mentioned in the commentary on the Pākṣikasūtr and the Nandīcūṛṇi. The time of the commentaries is considered to be around the 7th century CE, so the Mahapratyakhyan must have been composed before the Nandīcūṛṇi. Further, the Mahapratyakhyan is clearly mentioned in the original Nandīsutr and Pākṣikasūtr. Muni Shri Punyavijayaji and Paṇḍit Dalasukh Bhai Malavaniya have discussed the time of Devavācak, the author of the Nandīsutr, in detail. In the Nandīṇi, Devavācak is said to be a disciple of Śyāganī. Some scholars have identified Devavācak, the author of the Nandīsutr, with Devaddhigaṇī, who compiled the Āgamas...

... Introduction
There is a misconception that the 15 Kshamashramanas are all the same. Muni Shri Kalyanvijayji also fell prey to this misconception, but based on the mentions, while the guru of Devadhh is Ary Shandilly, the guru of Devavachka is Dushyagani. Therefore, it is certain that Devavachka and Devadhh are not the same person. Devavachka has explicitly mentioned Dushyagani in the Nandi Sutra Sthviravali.
Pandit Dalsukhabhai Malvaniya has considered the time of Devavachka to be Veer Nirvana Samvat 1020 or Vikram Samvat 550, but this is considered to be the final period. Devavachka would have existed before that. The mention of Nando and Anuyogadwar Sutras is in the Avashyak Niyukti, and if Avashyak Niyukti is also considered to be the work of the second Bhadrabahu, then its time is proven to be the first half of the fifth century Vikram. Based on all these grounds, it is certain that the Nandi Sutra, composed by Devavachka, is a work of the first half of the fifth century AD. In this context, we will direct you to see the discussion related to the time of Devavachka in the introduction of the Nandi Sutra by Muni Shri Punyavijayji and Pandit Dalsukhabhai Malvaniya for special knowledge. Since the Nandi Sutra mentions Mahapratyakhyan, based on this evidence, we can only say that this text was created before the 5th century AD. But it is difficult to say what the upper limit of its composition could be. Many stories of the Mahapratyakhyan Prakirnak are found in ancient Agamas like Uttaradhyayana, in Avashyak Niyukti, Uttaradhyayana Niyukti and Ogh Niyukti etc. Niyuktis and in Maran Vibhakti, Atur Pratyakhyan, Chandravedhyak, Titthogali, Sanstark, Aradhana Pataka and Aradhana Prakaran etc. Prakirnaks, as well as in the accepted texts of the Yapaneya and Digambar traditions, Bhagwati Aradhana, Mulachar, Niyamsar, Samyasar, Bhavpahuḍ etc. All these texts are from the middle of the 5th-6th century AD. Although it is difficult to determine here whether all these stories have been taken from these texts into Mahapratyakhyan or whether these stories have gone from Mahapratyakhyan into these texts, yet it can be assumed that the stories that are later than Nandi must have gone from Mahapratyakhyan. Especially the similar stories available in Mulachar, Bhagwati Aradhana etc. must have gone from Mahapratyakhyan directly or indirectly. Again, the sub...

The **Mahapanchavaanapariṇṇaya**

The **taḍpaṭra** (palm leaf) copies also confirm that this text is sufficiently ancient.

A significant piece of evidence for considering the time of composition of the **Mahapratyākhyāna** is the mention of the **dvādaśavidha śruta-skandha** (twelve categories of scriptures) in it. This implies that the **dvādaśavidha śruta-skandha** existed when this text came into being. We must remember that the concept of the **dvādaśa-aṅga** (twelve parts) is quite ancient in the Jain tradition. The **dvādaśa-aṅga** are also mentioned in ancient **āgama** texts like **sthānāṅga**, **samavāyāṅga**, etc. Although this statement does not provide much help in determining the time of composition of this text, it can be said that this text was composed when the **dvādaśavidha śruta-skandha** existed. The mention of the **dvādaśa-aṅga** in the text also automatically implies that this text was composed after the composition of the **dvādaśa-aṅga** and before the disappearance of the earlier literature. The mention of the **dvādaśa-aṅga** in this text, but the absence of the names of **niyukti**, **bhāṣya** and **cūrṇī**, indicates that this text was composed sometime after the second century CE and before the fifth century CE.

Another point worth noting in relation to the time of composition is that this text does not mention **guṇasthāna** (categories of qualities) anywhere in the context of **samādhi-maraṇa** (death in meditation), whereas the **yāpanīya** tradition's authoritative texts on **samādhi-maraṇa**, **Bhagavati Ārādhanā** and **Mūlācāra**, also discuss **guṇasthāna**. In an independent essay, we have considered the time of the developed concept of **guṇasthāna** to be after the **Tattvārthabhāṣya**, i.e., after the third century CE, and before the **Sarvārthasiddhiṭīkā**, i.e., before the fifth-sixth century CE. Based on this, we can say that the concept of **guṇasthāna** was fully developed around the fifth century CE. This also leads us to the same conclusion that the **Mahapratyākhyāna**...

## Introduction

17

The Mahapratyakhyana is a composition from before the 17th century. In conclusion, it can be said that the Mahapratyakhyana was composed sometime between the 2nd and 4th centuries. 

**Subject Matter:**

The Mahapratyakhyana contains a total of 142 verses, which describe the following subject matter:

The text begins with a mangalacharan, paying homage to the Tirthankaras, Jindevas, Siddhas, and Sannyamīs.  Following this, it states that one should renounce all types of external and internal titles through mind, speech, and body (1-5).

It states the equality of all beings, saying that one should forgive all beings and that all beings should forgive them. It also speaks of condemning, reproaching, and criticizing actions that are worthy of condemnation, reproach, and criticism (6-8). It inspires the individual to remain steadfast in detachment, knowing the nature of possessiveness. Regarding the soul, it states that the soul is the renunciation, and that restraint and yoga are also the soul (9-11).

The next verse condemns the non-observance of the fundamental and secondary virtues. Upadhyay Shri Devendramuni Shastri, in his book "Jain Agam Sahitya Manan aur Meemamsa," describes the subject matter of the Mahapratyakhyana, interpreting this verse as follows: "The seeker should renounce the fundamental and secondary virtues." However, looking at the original text, it is clear that it does not call for the renunciation of the fundamental and secondary virtues. Instead, it clearly states that due to carelessness, I condemn all those virtues (qualities) that I have not been able to cultivate in the fundamental and secondary virtues (12).

While discussing the soul, it states that the soul is the individual's own (self), while all other substances are not theirs but external. It also states that due to the chain of suffering, one should renounce the connections in three ways:

## Chapter 18: The Great Liberation

This chapter provides guidance on how to conduct oneself (13-17). It states that one should criticize, condemn, and censure those who engage in unrestrained behavior, ignorance, and falsehood, as well as all types of offenses, known and unknown (18-20). Maya (illusion) is described as something to be abandoned, not embraced. A virtuous person should criticize all their own faults, abandoning Maya and pride (21-23).

The chapter then explores the question of who attains liberation. It states that only those who have shed the three poisons of Maya, etc., achieve liberation. These three poisons – falsehood, Maya, and attachment – are described as harmful, hindering the attainment of enlightenment and leading to endless cycles of rebirth if they remain in the mind during the time of meditation (24-29). Therefore, a vigilant seeker strives to eliminate these poisons from their heart to escape rebirth (24-29).

The chapter also advises disciples to confess all their actions and inactions to their guru, and then follow the penance prescribed by the guru (30-32). It emphasizes the need to abandon all forms of violence, falsehood, stealing, sexual misconduct, and attachment in thought, word, and deed. It highlights the 8.4 million species in the world, stating that a soul is born in each of these species countless times (33-40).

The chapter praises the concept of "Pandit-maran" (wise death), stating that parents, siblings, children, etc., are neither protectors nor saviors. Each soul acts alone and experiences the consequences of its actions alone. Individuals should remember the suffering in hell, heaven, and the human realm, as well as the death that awaits even in the heavenly realm, and strive for a wise death. A wise death can end countless cycles of rebirth (41-50).

The chapter concludes by discussing the harmful nature of attachment to food, sensual pleasures, and possessions, urging their abandonment (51-60). It also advises the abandonment of anger, pride, Maya, greed, attachment, hatred, and thirst, and encourages the practice of the five great vows (61-70).

---------------------------
## Introduction

The following chapters contain details related to the six *leshyas* and meditation. It is stated here that the *Krishna*, *Neela*, and *Kapota* *leshyas*, as well as the *Aarta* and *Roudra* meditations, are all to be abandoned. However, the *Tejo*, *Padma*, and *Shukla* *leshyas*, and the *Dharma* and *Shukla* meditations are to be adopted. Details of the six *leshyas* and meditation are also found in the *Sthananga*, *Samavayanga*, *Uttaraadhyayana*, and other *Agam* texts (71-72).

It is stated that a *sanayati* (practitioner) who is endowed with *Triguti*, *Panchasamiti*, and *Dwadash Bhavana* should protect the five great vows (73-76). It is also stated that *Guptis* and *Samitis* are the protectors and saviors of an individual (77).

Not everyone is capable of achieving the purpose of the soul. Who is capable of achieving the purpose of the soul? It is stated that if a virtuous person is free from desire and self-aware, they can achieve the purpose of their soul even in a cave, on a rocky surface, or in an inaccessible place (80-84).

While describing the merits and demerits of *Akrit-yoga* and *Krit-yoga*, it is stated that even if someone is learned, but has outward-facing senses, a broken character, is unrefined, and has not practiced in the past, they will inevitably fall into the lower realms at the time of death. Such a person is unable to bear the consequences of their actions at the time of death. However, a person who is not attached to worldly pleasures, does not desire future rewards, and whose passions have been destroyed, will not be disturbed even when facing death, but will embrace it with eagerness (85-93). This is indeed the state of *Samadhi-maran* (death in meditation). Every Jain follower desires to die in this way, free from all kinds of afflictions, abandoning attachment and aversion, in the final moments of their life.

What is the cause of *Samadhi-maran*? It is stated that neither a bed of grass nor a bed of soft earth is the cause of *Samadhi-maran*. 1. *Sthananga* 1/191, 3/1/58, 3/4/515, 4/1/60. 2. *Samavayanga* 4/20, 6/31. 3. *Uttaraadhyayana* 30/35, 31/8.

The soul that is pure, in other words, the one who has conquered the four *kṣayās*, is the one who is the *saṁstāraka*. 
The path that the seeker enters into the path of Dharma is given the utmost importance and it is said that the seeker should not abandon that path even at the end of his life (101-106). The Dharma as exemplified by the Jina Devas is described as beneficial in the text and it is said that one should have faith in it with mind, speech and body, because this is the path to liberation (107). In the following verses, mentioning various types of renunciations, it is said that the seeker should renounce all prohibited actions in three ways: those that are not worthy of being thought about by the mind, those that are not worthy of being spoken by speech, and those that are not worthy of being done by the body (108-110).
The five positions of Arhant, Siddha, Acharya, Upadhyaya and Sadhu are considered worthy of worship and it is said that by remembering them, a person should abandon his sinful actions (114-120). While discussing the subject of pain, it is said that if a Muni takes refuge, he will suffer. All beings are advised to bear pain with equanimity (121-122).
The text describes the solitary conduct of the Jina Kalpi Muni as being taught by the Jinas and praised by the learned, and the *abhyudyatamaraṇa* served by the Jina Kalpis is praised (126-127). It is said to the seeker that he should destroy the four *kṣayās*, the three *gāravas*, the objects of the five senses and the *pariṣahas* and raise the flag of *ārādhana* (134). 
While advising to cross the ocean of the world and destroy the karmas, it is said: "O seeker! If you wish to cross the ocean of the world, do not think, "I will live for a long time or I will die soon." Instead, think that liberation is possible only by being vigilant towards knowledge, vision, character and Jina's words (135-136).
Upadhyay Shri Devendra Muni Shastri, in his book 'Jain Agam Sahitya Manan aur Meemamsa', while describing the subject matter of *Mahapratyakhyana*,

Page #30:
---------------------------
The introduction states that a seeker attains liberation in seven to eight births through inferior and medium *āradhanā*. Upon examining the original text, it is found that although the text mentions four *skandhas* of *āradhanā* - knowledge, perception, conduct and austerity, and its three types - excellent, medium and inferior in verse 137, but in verse 138, which indicates the fruit of *āradhanā*, it is said that the wise seeker who performs the excellent practice of these four *skandhas* is liberated in the same birth. Again, in verse 139, it is said that the wise seeker who performs the inferior practice of all four *āradhanā* *skandhas* attains liberation after seven to eight births by undergoing pure transmigration. Here, the text does not mention the fruit of medium *āradhanā* anywhere. We would like to know from the Muni Ji on what basis he has said that the one who performs medium *āradhanā* attains liberation after seven to eight births. If he has made this statement on the basis of any other text, then it is a different matter, otherwise there is no such indication in the present work to confirm his conclusion. If we have to find out the fruit of medium *āradhanā*, then we will have to find it out only between the fruit obtained from excellent *āradhanā* and inferior *āradhanā*, i.e. it will have to be assumed that a person can attain liberation in a minimum of two births and a maximum of six births through medium *āradhanā* based on the purity of the results.
In *Bhagawti Āradhanā* also, while stating the fruit of medium *āradhanā*, it has been said that the patient man attains liberation in the third birth by performing medium *āradhanā*. Again, the statement of *Bhagawti Āradhanā* regarding the fruit of excellent and inferior *āradhanā* is similar to the great rejection.
The text concludes by saying that the patient man also attains death and the cowardly man also, but it is only the one who attains death with patience that dies meaningfully. Because death in meditation is the best death. The last verse says that the restrained seeker who attains death by following this rejection properly will either be a celestial being or a *siddh* after death.

(Āturapratyākhyāna, Gāthā 29) (ii) The *Mūlaguṇa* and *Uttara-guṇa* are not mine, nor are they mine in the sense of being my own. I have come to know them all through the *Parikkama* of the *Āgama*.

## Mahapacchakkhagapadannaya
[16]
[17]
Due to the **samyoga** (association) root, the **jiva** (soul) experiences the chain of suffering. Therefore, all **samyoga** relationships should be abandoned in all three ways. 
(Mahapratyakhyana, Gatha 17)
I condemn and despise the **asamsama** (uncontrolled) mind, the **micchattā** (wrong belief), and the **mamatā** (attachment) in all beings and non-beings.
(Mahapratyakhyana, Gatha 18)
I praise those who know the **Jina** (Victorious One) in all places, in all ways.
(Mahapratyakhyana, Gatha 20)
[18]
[19]
The **maya** (illusion) that has arisen and that has not arisen is the path to be destroyed. It is not possible to destroy it through praise, condemnation, or contempt.
(Mahapratyakhyana, Gatha 21)
Just as a child, playing, speaks both truth and falsehood, so too, the **maya**-bound, deluded one praises.
(Mahapratyakhyana, Gatha 22)
[20]

Page #44:
---------------------------
Other Agam texts (iv) are characterized by knowledge-perception (naan-dasan), while the rest are characterized by external emotions (bahira bhava) and all are characterized by conjunction (sanjog). 
(Bhaavpahuud, Gatha 59) [16] The root of conjunction (sanjoy) is the cause of suffering (dukkha) and its continuation. Therefore, the relationship of conjunction (sanjoy) is to be abandoned in all three ways.
(Moolaachaar, Gatha 41) [17] (i) I condemn and despise all that is uncontrolled (assamjam), ignorant (an-naan), wrong (michchatt), and mine (mammatt), both in living beings (jeevesu) and non-living beings (ajeevesu).
(Aaturpratyakhyan, Gatha 31) (i) I condemn and despise all that is uncontrolled (assamjam), ignorant (an-naan), wrong (michchatt), and mine (mammatt), both in living beings (jeevesu) and non-living beings (ajeevesu).
(Moolaachaar, Gatha 51) [18] (i) Those who know the Jinas, who are free from attachment (avaraha), in knowledge-perception (naan-dasan) and conduct (charitra), are all to be praised (aaloe) in all ways.
(Chandravedhyak, Gatha 132) (ii) Those who know the Jinas, who are free from attachment (avaraha), in every place (jesu jesu thaanesu), are all to be praised (aaloe) in all ways.

(Nishith Sutra Bhashya, Gatha 3873) [19] The arisen (uppanna) and the not arisen (anuppanna), the illusion (maya) that has enveloped (anumaggato), is to be destroyed (nihantavva). Praising (aaloayan), condemning (nindan), and despising (garahan) do not destroy it (te na poono vi biianti).
(Nishith Sutra Bhashya, Gatha 3864) [20] (i) Just as a child jumps and speaks about what is work (kajj) and what is not work (akajj), so too, one should praise (aaloejja) the illusion (maya) and the delusion (mosam) by understanding it.
(Aaturpratyakhyan, Gatha 33) 1. In those places (tesu tesu thaano) Aaturpratyakhyan. 2. In the world (loe) Aradhana Pataaka.

## The Great Renunciation

[21]
[22]
The same upright and pure Dharma abides. Nirvana is the ultimate goal, for the purified and the pure.
(Mahapratyakhyana, Gatha 23) One does not become purified with all the impurities, as it is said in the teachings of the wise. One becomes purified of all impurities by abandoning the impurities.
(Mahapratyakhyana, Gatha 24) Nor does the Tathagata, nor the Asanga, nor the wicked one, nor the one who is angry, do anything wrong. The wicked one, like a snake, is full of poison and anger.
(Mahapratyakhyana, Gatha 27)
[23]

(iii) Just as a child jumps and speaks straightforwardly about what is to be done and what is not to be done, so too should one be aware of the illusory world and be free from it. (Ogh Niyukti, Gatha 801) (Panchashak, Gatha 741)
Other Agama Texts
(1) Just as a child jumps and speaks straightforwardly about what is to be done and what is not to be done, so too should one be aware of the illusory world and be free from it. (Aradhana Pataka, Gatha 172) (Aradhana Prakarana, Gatha 18)
[23]
(iv) Just as a child jumps and speaks straightforwardly about what is to be done and what is not to be done, so too should one be aware of the illusory world and be free from it. (Nishita Sutra Bhashya, Gatha 3863) (v) Just as a child jumps and speaks straightforwardly about what is to be done and what is not to be done, so too should one be aware of the illusory world and be free from it. (Moolachar, Gatha 56) (vi) Just as a child jumps and speaks straightforwardly about what is to be done and what is not to be done, so too should one be aware of the illusory world and be free from it. (Bhagavati Aradhana, Gatha 549)
The Dharma of the righteous and pure abides. Nirvana is the ultimate goal, like a white cloud. (Uttaraadhyayanasutra, Gatha 3/12)
One does not become aware of the self, just as it is said in the scriptures, for those who are deluded. The self becomes aware when the delusion is removed. (Aradhana Pataka, Gatha 218) (Aradhana Prakarana, Gatha 8) (Ogh Nirukti, Gatha 798)
The one who is deluded does not understand, just as a snake is compared to one who is angry. (Aradhana Pataka, Gatha 215) (Aradhana Prakarana, Gatha 5) (Ogh Niyukti, Gatha 803) (Panchashak, Gatha 731)
1. In Aradhana Prakarana, 'sijjhai' is used instead of 'sujjhai'.
2. In Aradhana Prakarana, 'pamayo' is used instead of 'pamaio', and in Ogh Nirukti, 'pamaino' is used.

[24]
Whoever acts with **bhavasalla** (attachment to worldly existence) without **anudhiya** (reflection) in this **uttimaḍakāla** (precious time), is **dullhambahohiyattam** (hard to attain liberation) and **ananta samsariyattam** (bound to endless cycles of rebirth).
(**Mahapratyakhyana**, Gatha 28)
[25]
They are rescued by the **garavarahita** (free from pride) **mula** (root) of **punabbhavalaya** (merit-making), which is **micchadasanasalla** (attachment to wrong views), **mayasalla** (attachment to illusion), and **niyanam** (control).
(**Mahapratyakhyana**, Gatha 29)
[26]
Even a **kayapavo** (person) who is **aloiya** (ignorant) and **nidiu** (sleeping) in the **gurusaghasa** (company of the wise) becomes **airegalahu** (light) and **oharivabharu** (burdened) like a **bharavahu** (carrier of burdens).
(**Mahapratyakhyana**, Gatha 30)
[27]
I renounce all **paṇārambha** (beginning of life), **aliyavayaṇa** (killing), **savvamadinnādāṇa** (taking what is not given), and **abbambha pariggaha** (acceptance of gifts).
(**Mahapratyakhyana**, Gatha 33)
[28]
No creature is **dusiy** (polluted) by **rage**, **hatred**, or **parinaamaṇa** (change). This is the **pacchakhaṇa** (understanding) that is **bhavasuddha** (pure in essence) and should be **muṇeyavva** (meditated upon).
(**Mahapratyakhyana**, Gatha 36)
[29]
I would rather die a **balamarana** (death of a fool) in the **tiriyammi** (animal realm) than be **mayaim** (deluded) and **bahuyai** (attached to many things). Therefore, I will strive for a **panḍiyamarana** (death of a wise person).

## Mahapratyakhyana (Great Renunciation)

**[30]**
The world is filled with those who are attached to Maya, parents, and friends, for the sake of worldly existence.  Many are born in the cycle of births and deaths, and they do not find refuge or liberation.

One creates karma, another experiences the consequences of that karma. One lives in the cycle of birth, old age, death, and the four gatis (states of existence).

I would rather die than endure the suffering of birth and death, or the torments of hell.

##  Mahapaccakkhannapainnanyam

In this comparative study, we find that out of the 142 verses of Mahapaccakkhanna, 4 verses are found in the Agam literature, 8 verses in the Niruktis, 8 verses in the Bhashya literature, and 60 verses in other miscellaneous works besides Maranavibhakti. As far as the Shourseni Yapaniya Agam equivalent literature is concerned, about 45 verses of the Mahapaccakkhanna miscellaneous work are also found in Mulachar and Bhagavati Aradhana. In the major texts of Yapaniya literature, Mulachar and Bhagavati Aradhana, we see that not only Mahapaccakkhanna, but also verses from many miscellaneous works have been assimilated in their original form, except for the Shourseni and Ardhamagadhi language transformations. The inclusion of most of the verses of Avasyakanuyukti and the entire Aturpratyakhyana in Mulachar indicates that the Yapaniya tradition initially accepted the miscellaneous literature, but in later times, when texts like Mulachar and Bhagavati Aradhana were composed based on the verses of miscellaneous literature and the Niyukti literature, the tradition of studying miscellaneous works and Niruktis also became extinct in that tradition. Only in Digambar literature do we find a verse that states that the Acharaanga, etc., Anga texts and the earlier miscellaneous works were formulated by the Jina Devas.

Whether directly or through the Yapaniya literature, Mulachar and Bhagavati Aradhana, many verses of the miscellaneous literature are also found in Kundakunda's literature.  Alone, 9 verses of the Mahapaccakkhanna miscellaneous work are found in various texts of Kundakunda. The presence of these verses in Bhagavati Aradhana and Mulachar suggests that these verses were interpolated into Kundakunda's texts from Bhagavati Aradhana and Mulachar. Here, the question can be asked: Is it not possible that these verses went from Kundakunda's literature to the miscellaneous works? The direct and clear answer to this question is that it has been proven by many evidences that Kundakunda is not an Acharya from before the 6th century.

- The 'Mirkara inscription', which claims to be sufficiently ancient to prove Kundakunda's existence, has been proven to be forged by historians. After the Mirkara inscription was proven to be forged, no other inscription from before the 9th century is available that mentions Kundakunda or his lineage. Furthermore, the fact that no other Acharya before Amritachandra (10th century) wrote a commentary on Kundakunda's texts during the era of commentaries and interpretations also proves that Kundakunda is relatively later. The clear concept of Gunasthan and Saptabhangi found in Kundakunda's literature also leads to the same conclusion, that Kundakunda is an Acharya from after the 5th century, because the clear concept of Gunasthan and Saptabhangi was formed in the 4th-5th century, as we have mentioned in the previous pages of the introduction. Thus, the attempt to place Kundakunda in the 1st century AD is neither supported by any inscriptional evidence nor is any such literary evidence available in this regard that can prove Kundakunda to be from the 1st century. In determining the time of Kundakunda, we agree with Prof. Madhusudan Dhaky, according to whom Kundakunda is an Acharya from after the 6th century. On this basis, it can be said that the stories of Mahapratyakhyan have gone from Bhagavati worship and Mulachar to Kundakunda literature.  _ In this comparative study, the question naturally arises whether the similar stories found in Mahapratyakhyan have come into this text from the Agamas and appointments or whether these stories have gone from this text into the Agamas and appointments? As far as the Agama literature is concerned, it can be clearly said that the stories found in Mahapratyakhyan

**Mahapacc Kshanaparinnay**

All four similar verses are taken from the Agam literature itself, because these four verses are from the Uttaradhyayanasutra and there they are in their proper place and order. Also, the Uttaradhyayanasutra is older than the Mahapratyakhyan, so it is certain that these four verses have gone from the Uttaradhyayanasutra to the Mahapratyakhyan. Again, this text mentions the twelve-fold Shruta-skandha. This also makes it clear that the Anga Agam literature was composed before the Mahapratyakhyan.

As far as the Niyukti literature is concerned, it contains 8 verses of the Mahapratyakhyan. Of these eight verses, most are found only in the Oghanniyukti. We feel that these verses have gone from the Mahapratyakhyan to the Oghanniyukti, because the Oghanniyukti is not mentioned in the Nandi Sutra, while the Mahapratyakhyan is mentioned in the Nandi Sutra. Therefore, it must be assumed that the Oghanniyukti was composed after the Mahapratyakhyan. On this basis, it seems more reasonable to say that these verses have gone from the Mahapratyakhyan to the Oghanniyukti.

Regarding the Churni literature, we would only say that the Churnis were composed after the Prakirnak literature, because the Nandiini clearly mentions the Mahapratyakhyan by name. Again, the Churnis are originally written in prose, so if any verse of the Mahapratyakhyan is quoted in them, it must be assumed that these verses have gone from the Mahapratyakhyan to them, because chronologically, while the Churnis are from the 7th century, the Mahapratyakhyan is a composition from before the 5th century.

From the point of view of its subject matter, the Mahapratyakhyan is a Prakirnak text that is primarily focused on practice. It mainly provides instructions on Samadhimaran and its previous process. Samadhimaran can be considered an important part of Jain practice. In the Jain tradition, whether a sadhak is a muni or a householder, he is encouraged to take Samadhimaran. There are some verses in the Mahapratyakhyan that encourage the sadhak to take Samadhimaran, and there are some other verses that instruct on criticism, etc. In fact, they are in the form of the previous process of Samadhimaran.

1. Mahapratyakhyan, verse 102.
2. Nandi Churni, Sutra 81.

Page #64:
---------------------------
These 55 are. The purpose of the remaining other villages is to instruct the seeker on how to maintain their mental attitudes in the state of Samadhimaran.
The concept of Samadhimaran is found in Jain Agam literature from the time of Acharanga. The first Shruta Skandha of Acharanga not only inspires Samadhimaran, but also clarifies its process. 'The fifth chapter of Uttaradhyayanasutra has a detailed discussion on the nature of Balamaran and Panditamaran. Many biographies described in Jain literature are also depicted as taking Samadhimaran at the end of their practice. The present text, Mahapratyakhyan, as its name suggests, is also indicative of Samadhimaran or in other words, it is a text related to Samadhimaran.
Samadhimaran means that now death is present at the door of life and is giving notice of its arrival, then the seeker should abandon the efforts of body nourishment and practice the feeling of ruthlessness towards the body and instead of hiding from death present at the door, prepare himself for its welcome. In fact, Samadhimaran is the process of embracing death peacefully, it is the test hour of practice. We can understand it this way that if a seeker has practiced non-attachment and equality throughout his life, but if he gets distracted at the time of death, then his entire practice becomes futile in a way, just as if a student does not succeed in the exam, then his study is not considered meaningful. Samadhimaran is the test of our life's practice and Mahapratyakhyan instructs us to pass that test. _ Samadhimaran is neither an escape from life nor suicide, but it is an art of embracing death and he who has not learned this art, his life does not become meaningful.

Mahapंचक्खाणपइण्णर्य
He who sees history, has complete faith in this. He who does not live, does not die.
In reality, Mahapratyakhyan presents before us a detached view of life, which makes both our birth and death meaningful. We can summarize this life view of Mahapratyakhyan as follows:
Life came, fate took it away. Neither our happiness came, nor our happiness went.
Thus, we see that Mahapratyakhyan is a text that gives us a new perspective on living life. The decision of Agam, Ahimsa-Samata and Prakrut Sansthan, Udaipur to publish this scattered literature, which propagates such noble life values, is meaningful only when we can study these scattered literature and implement the life values propagated in them in our lives.

(Various Confessions) Whatever I have done wrong, in thought, word, or deed, I condemn it completely. I make the threefold confession, free from attachment. ||3||

Externally, internally, and in between, from body to all possessions, with mind, speech, and body, I confess all three. ||4||

I confess attachment, bondage, anger, hatred, pride, greed, fear, sorrow, and the cycle of birth and death. ||5||

(Confession to All Living Beings) With anger, prejudice, and unkindness, and with stubbornness, whatever I have spoken, I confess it threefold. ||6||

(Various Renunciations) (3) I condemn all my evil conduct with all my being and accept Samayik in its threefold form, free from all exceptions. (4) The practitioner who accepts Samadhi-maran should renounce all external and internal attachments, food, body, etc., in thought, word and deed. (5) The practitioner should renounce all attachments in the form of love and hatred, joy and sorrow, curiosity, fear and grief, and attraction and aversion.

(Atonement for All Beings) (6) The practitioner should say: "I seek forgiveness in threefold form for whatever I have said out of anger, regret, ingratitude, and deceit." (7) I forgive all beings, may all beings forgive me. Renouncing all Asravas, I resolve to attain Samadhi (i.e., I unite myself with Samadhi).

**(Severing Attachment and Self-Dharma)** (9) I know the helpless state of the four types of bodily food, tools and all substances, and I know the attachment I have towards them.

**(10)** I know the attachment that exists in my non-attachment (i.e., dispassion). Knowing that the soul is my support, the seeker renounces all other (external substances).

**(11)** The soul is my knowledge, the soul is my vision and my character. The soul is my renunciation, and the soul is my restraint and yoga (physical, verbal and mental actions).

**(Worship of the Fundamental and Secondary Qualities with Self-Condemnation)** (12) I condemn and repent for all those (qualities) that I have not been able to worship due to my negligence in the fundamental and secondary qualities. I renounce the future (faults).

**(Oneness)** (13) I am alone, I have no one, and I belong to no one. In this way, the seeker disciplines the soul with a detached attitude.

**(14)** The being is born alone and dies alone. It is alone that dies and it is alone that becomes free from the karmic dirt.

## Mahapratyakhyana Prakirnak

**(15)** The (Jiva) alone performs karma, and alone experiences its fruits. Alone it is born, dies, and alone it goes to the afterlife. 

**(16)** This eternal 'Atma' alone, endowed with knowledge and vision, is my (self), and all other substances, endowed with the characteristic of 'Samyoga', are external (par) to me. 

**(17)** Due to the 'Samyoga' relationship, Jivas experience the cycle of suffering. Therefore, (the seeker) should renounce all 'Samyogic' relationships in all three ways.

**(18)** I condemn and renounce 'Asanyama', ignorance, 'Mithyatva', and the sense of 'Mamatva' (mine-ness) inherent in all Jivas and Ajiva. I know all kinds of 'Asanyama', unreliability, and 'Mithyatva'. Therefore, I renounce all forms of 'Mamatva' and seek forgiveness from all.

**(20)** The Tirthankaras know all the offenses I have committed in all situations. Therefore, I am present to criticize them completely.

**(21)** Maya, whether it is born or unborn, is worthy of renunciation. Through condemnation and renunciation, it will not be reborn again.

**Note:** 
* 'Jiva' refers to the soul or living being.
* 'Karma' refers to actions and their consequences.
* 'Samyoga' refers to the relationship between the soul and matter.
* 'Asanyama' refers to non-restraint or indulgence.
* 'Mithyatva' refers to false belief or wrong understanding.
* 'Mamatva' refers to the sense of 'mine-ness' or attachment.
* 'Tirthankara' refers to a spiritual teacher or prophet in Jainism.
* 'Maya' refers to illusion or delusion.

**The Great Liberation** (The nature of liberation and its cause)

Just as a child, jumping about, speaks both truth and falsehood, so too does the deluded one speak, being bound by illusion. || 22 ||

The Dharma of the liberated one is pure and steadfast. Nirvana is the ultimate goal, attained by the destruction of passions. || 23 ||

(The nature of liberation)

The one who is bound by passions does not attain liberation, just as a ship does not sail without a rudder. The one who is free from all passions attains liberation, just as a ship with a rudder sails. || 24 ||

Even if one has many passions, if one is liberated by the teachings of the Guru, one becomes free from passions and attains the state of liberation. || 25 ||

Even if one has few passions, if one is not liberated by the teachings of the Guru, even if one has attained the highest state of knowledge, one does not become liberated. || 26 ||

The one who is not liberated does not perform good deeds, nor does he avoid evil deeds. He is like a snake, poisonous and angry. || 27 ||

The one who performs actions motivated by passions, without being liberated, in this very life, is destined for endless suffering in the cycle of birth and death. || 28 ||

The Guru, the refuge of the virtuous, liberates one from the root of all evil, from the passions of wrong belief, illusion, and ignorance. || 29 ||

(The fruits of liberation)

The person who is liberated by the teachings of the Guru becomes light and free, like a ship that has been unloaded of its burden. || 30 ||

Page #74:
---------------------------
## Mahapratyakhyanaprakirnak (The Nature of Criticism and Liberation) (22) Just as a child naturally expresses his actions and inactions, in the same way, a seeker should criticize (all his faults) by abandoning deceit and ego. (23) Only the simple-minded are purified, and in the pure-minded, Dharma resides, and (he who has Dharma residing in him) attains ultimate Nirvana, like fire moistened by ghee. (Shalyoddhranaprarupana). (24) In the Jain teachings, it is said that even a person free from karmic impurities, if afflicted by the three poisons of Maya, etc., does not attain liberation. But the being who has liberated himself from all poisons, that being free from afflictions, attains liberation. (25) Those (disciples) who are deeply afflicted by the poison of attachment, who criticize (themselves) before their Guru, attain Samadhi-death and become devotees. (26) Those (disciples) who are minimally afflicted by the poison of attachment, who do not criticize (themselves) before their Guru, even though they are rich in scriptural knowledge, do not become devotees. (27-28) A misused weapon, poison, a ghost, a machine operated incorrectly, and a furious serpent do not harm a careless person as much as the poisons of Maya, Mithyatva, and Nidana, residing in the mind during Samadhi, harm. (This) makes the attainment of enlightenment rare and (the person) becomes eternally bound to the cycle of birth and death. (29) Therefore, the (seeker) free from pride, removes the root of the creeper of rebirth, the poison of Mithyatva, the poison of Maya, and the poison of Nidana (from within). (Criticism's Fruit) (30) By criticizing and condemning his own sins in the presence of the Guru, a person quickly becomes free from burden, just like a burden-bearer after unloading his load.

## The Great Chapter on the Five Great Vows (Pāyachchitta Anusaran Paruvana)

**(Following the Confession)**  The confession that the guru instructs on the path, that should be followed diligently, with a fear of falling into wrong conduct. || 31 ||

**(Free from the Ten Evils)**  Therefore, everything should be avoided with a mind free from the ten evils. Whatever action is done, it should be spoken of as if it were a dream. || 32 ||

**(Carrying a Living Being, Cutting, Stealing, Lying, and Sexual Misconduct)**  The beginning of the taking of life, the five kinds of stealing, the three kinds of lying, and sexual misconduct, all these should be completely abandoned, as well as the acceptance of gifts. || 33 ||

**(Food and Drink)**  All food and drink, both external and internal, should be consumed in three ways. || 34 ||

**(Purity of Conduct, Purity of Thought, and Right Understanding)**  When a famine arises, or a great calamity occurs, whatever is protected and not destroyed, that should be known as purity of conduct. || 35 ||

**(Right Understanding)**  Whatever is not tainted by attachment, aversion, or delusion, that should be known as purity of thought and right understanding. || 36 ||

**(The Limitless Ocean)**  The ocean of milk, the ocean of honey, and the ocean of water are all limited. But the ocean of the world is limitless, with countless mothers and fathers. || 37 ||

**(The Rising of the Sun)**  Many times, the sun rises and sets in the ocean of water. Similarly, many times, the sun of knowledge rises and sets in the ocean of the world. || 38 ||

**(Summary)**

1. Whatever action is done, it should be spoken of as if it were a dream.
2. All gifts should be abandoned.
3. All acceptance of gifts should be abandoned.
4. Many times, the sun rises and sets in the ocean of water.

## The Great Discourse on Atonement (Atonement Practice Model)

(31) When a knowledgeable guru instructs a disciple on the atonement for their offense, the disciple, who is fearful of the cycle of births and deaths, should follow the instructions diligently. (32) Freed from the ten vices, the disciple should confess all their actions and inactions, without hiding anything, to their guru. (Rejection of violence, etc., and renunciation of food, etc.) (33) I renounce all forms of violence, falsehood, theft, sexual misconduct, and possessions. (34) I renounce all four types of food (eating, drinking, etc.), all external possessions, and all internal possessions (passions). (Renunciation in the form of pure conduct, pure intention, and complete rejection) (35) I consider those rules of conduct that are not broken even in the face of a terrifying forest, famine, or extreme terror, to be pure. (36) I consider that renunciation which is not tainted by attachment, aversion, or passion, to be pure in intention. (Discourse on Dispassion) (37) This being has drunk so much milk from the breasts of different mothers in its countless cycles of existence that it surpasses the water of the ocean. (38) This being has cried so much in different wombs during its countless cycles of existence that its tears surpass the water of the ocean.

## Mahapacchalanaparinnayan

There is no such thing as a "good" death in this world.  Even while wandering in the cycle of existence, there is no place where one can die peacefully.  || 39 ||

There are countless births in this world, millions of species, and countless beings are born in each of them.  || 40 ||

(Panditarana Paruvaana) I am afraid of dying in the animal realm, where there are many deaths and many young ones die.  I am afraid of dying a Panditarana death.  || 41 ||

I am afraid of dying a Panditarana death because of my attachment to my wife, my children, my brothers, and my sisters.  || 42 ||

The world is filled with attachments to family, friends, and worldly possessions.  Many beings are born and reborn, but they do not find refuge in these things.  || 43 ||

One creates karma, another experiences the consequences of that karma.  One is reborn, lives, ages, and dies, caught in the cycle of existence.  || 44 ||

I am afraid of dying a Panditarana death because of the suffering of birth, death, and the hells.  || 45 ||

I am afraid of dying a Panditarana death because of the suffering of birth, death, and the hells in the animal realm.  || 46 ||

I am afraid of dying a Panditarana death because of the suffering of birth, death, and the hells in the human realm.  || 47 ||

I am afraid of dying a Panditarana death because of the suffering of birth, death, and the hells in the heavenly realms.  || 48 ||

Only one Panditarana death can break the cycle of countless rebirths.  One must die this death to become liberated.  || 49 ||

How can I achieve this Panditarana death, which the Jinas have attained?  How can I become pure and liberated?  || 50 ||

## Mahapratyakhyan Prakirnak 13

(39) There is no place in the universe, even a single hair's breadth, where this being has not taken birth and death while wandering in the world.
(40) Eighty-four lakh main divisions of species are said to exist in the universe, and this being has been born in each of these species countless times. (Panditmaran Praroopana)
(41) I have died countless times in the upper, lower, and intermediate realms due to ignorance (Balmaran). Therefore, remembering those Balmarans, I will die the death of a wise one (Panditmaran).
(42-43) Remembering the impermanence of worldly relationships like parents, siblings, and children, I will die the death of a wise one. Because mothers, fathers, relatives, and all beings in the world, in various species, are neither protectors nor saviors.
(44) The being alone performs karma, alone experiences the consequences of its bad karma, and alone attains old age and death, wandering in the four miserable states.
(45) Remembering the pains of birth, death, anxiety, and hellish life, I will die the death of a wise one.
(46) Remembering the pains of birth, death, anxiety, and animal life, I will die the death of a wise one.
(47) Remembering the pains of birth, death, anxiety, and human life, I will die the death of a wise one.
(48) Remembering birth, death, anxiety, and falling from the heavenly realms, I will die the death of a wise one.
(49) One Panditmaran ends hundreds of cycles of existence, therefore one should die that death (Panditmaran) which leads to remembrance.
(50) This remembrance is called Panditmaran by the Jinas. Having removed the thorns of Maya, Nidana, and Mithya (from the body), will I die the pure death of Praayopgaman?

## 24
(Nimobeesoo) In the cycle of existence, all twenty-four types of beings are bound. Due to the accumulation of karmic consequences, they are unable to escape the cycle of birth and death. ||51||

All these beings are bound in the wheel of existence, mostly due to their karmic consequences. They are bound by their actions and their consequences, and they cannot escape this cycle. ||52||

Due to their actions, all beings are born in the hellish realms. They are born in the hellish realms due to their actions, and they are born in the realms of misery due to their actions. ||53||

Due to their actions, they are born in the hellish realms. A fish goes to the terrible hell due to its actions. A person who eats meat is not able to escape the hellish realms. ||54||

Even if a being is subjected to thousands of tortures like thorns, stones, fire, salt water, etc., it cannot be freed from the cycle of birth and death by sensual pleasures. ||55||

Even if a being is subjected to thousands of tortures like thorns, stones, fire, salt water, etc., it cannot be freed from the cycle of birth and death by material wealth. ||56||

Even if a being is subjected to thousands of tortures like thorns, stones, fire, salt water, etc., it cannot be freed from the cycle of birth and death by delicious food. ||57||

A being trapped in the cycle of birth and death is like a fish caught in a net, or like a person trapped in a terrible hell. It cannot be freed from the cycle of birth and death by fragrant flowers. ||58||

This being is bound by its actions and cannot escape the cycle of birth and death. It is constantly subjected to the cycle of birth, aging, sickness, and death. It is constantly subjected to the cycle of birth, aging, sickness, and death. ||59||

## The Great Path (Niry-Upadesh) (51)

While wandering in the world of existence, all four types of pudgala dravya (skandha, desha, pradesha, and paramanu) have been bound to me (as karma). And through the results of my mind (mano-bhavas), I have accumulated eight types of karma. (52) While wandering in the cycle of existence, all those pudgala dravya have been transformed into food by me, yet I have not attained liberation. (53) Due to my greed for food, I have been born in the lower realms, in all the hells, and in many mleccha jati (lowly castes) in the human realm. (54) Due to greed for food, fish go to the painful hell realms. Therefore, even mentally desiring food with awareness is not permissible for a muni. (55) Just as fire cannot be satiated by offerings of grass and wood, and the salt sea cannot be filled by the waters of thousands of rivers, this being cannot be satisfied by sensual pleasures. (56) Just as fire cannot be satiated by offerings of grass and wood, and the salt sea cannot be filled by the waters of thousands of rivers, this being cannot be satisfied by wealth. (57) Just as fire cannot be satiated by offerings of grass and wood, and the salt sea cannot be filled by the waters of thousands of rivers, this being cannot be satisfied by various types of food. (58) Just as it is difficult to cross a vast hell like a great fire, this being cannot be satisfied by fragrances and garlands. (59) This being has never been satisfied by sound, form, fragrance, taste, and touch in the past, and will never be satisfied in the future.

This great ascetic, born from the wish-fulfilling tree, among the gods and the Kuru clan, is not attached to the world, nor to men, nor to the gods. ||60||

Neither by food nor by drink does he become attached to this body. If he is to be reborn, then he will be reborn. ||61||

He has enjoyed the best of pleasures, the royal pleasures of the wheel-turning king. He has seen the infinite, and is not attached to it. ||62||

He has enjoyed the pleasures of the milk-filled clusters, the sweet fruits, the great oceans, and many others. But his thirst is quenched by the water of liberation. ||63||

He has enjoyed the three kinds of pleasures, the pleasures of the senses, the pleasures of the mind, and the pleasures of the body. But he is not attached to them. ||64||

Whatever desires I have, I have given them up, along with anger, hatred, and attachment. I have given up all my possessions and I am content. ||65||

He has cut through the net of delusion, and has abandoned the eight karmas. He has broken the chains of birth and death, and has attained liberation. ||66||

He has conquered the five great vows, the three kinds of vows, and the vows of the body, speech, and mind. He is ready to face death. ||67||

(The five great vows)

I will protect myself from anger, pride, deceit, greed, and hatred. I will be mindful and protect myself from these five great vows. ||68||

I will avoid quarreling, backbiting, and gossip. I will be silent and protect myself from these five great vows. ||69||

I will control my five senses and avoid the five kinds of sensual pleasures. I will be fearless and protect myself from these five great vows. ||70||

## The Great Renunciation Discourse (60)

Devakuru and Uttar Kuru – where Kalpavriksha trees eternally exist, (there)
born and reborn as humans, Vidyadharas and Devas, (this being) has not been satiated. (61) The soul does not attain liberation through eating and drinking. If
(the soul) does not desire hellish realms, then it surely attains liberation. (62) (I) have attained the supreme enjoyments of Devas, Chakravartis (emperors) and kingdoms countless times, yet I have not been satisfied by them. (63) (I) have been born countless times in the Kshirodak ocean, Ikshu-ras ocean and the delicious Mahodadhi ocean, yet my thirst has not been quenched by their cool waters. (64) (This being) has experienced countless times the unparalleled joy of sensual pleasures related to love and desire in all three ways, yet its thirst for sensual pleasures has not been quenched.  Driven by attachment and aversion, whoever (person) makes various requests to me with attachment, I rebuke and scorn them. By ending the web of delusion, piercing the eight accumulated karmas, and breaking the cycle of birth and death (samsara), you
will be liberated from the world (bhavan-parampara). (67) (The seeker) should desire the death of a wise person, observing the five great vows in all three ways,
and being restrained in mind, speech and body (i.e., possessing tri-gupta).
(Five Great Vows Protection) (68) Abandoning anger, pride, deceit, greed and similarly attachment and aversion, I (am) diligently protecting the five great vows. (69) Abandoning strife, slander, gossip and criticism of others, I (am)
restrainedly protecting the five great vows. (70) By restraining the five types of sensual qualities and the five senses,

By practicing the **Mahapratyakhyana** and **Prakirnak** **Samvara**, and being fearless of honor and dishonor, I protect the five great vows.

(74) By restraining the four **Kshayas**, being free from the seven types of fear, and abandoning the eight **Mad** places, I protect the five great vows. (75) By being endowed with **Gupti** (**Tri-Gupti**), **Samiti** (**Panch Samiti**), **Bhavana** (**Dwadasha Bhavana**), and knowledge and vision, I, with restraint, protect the five great vows. (76) Being free from the three staffs, pure in the three organs, and free from the three **Shalyas** - in this way, I, with unwavering focus, protect the five great vows. (**Gupti Samiti Pradhan Prarupana**) (77) By eliminating the three types of **Shalyas**, I know the consequences of attachment. **Guptis** and **Samitis** are my refuge and salvation. (**Tap Mahatmya**) (78-79) Just as a skilled and intelligent **Niryamak** (ship captain) protects a ship filled with jewels in a turbulent sea with a **Chakraval**, similarly, those who follow the teachings, with patience and wisdom, protect the **Tap** (austerity) ship filled with virtues in the sea of **Trishna** (desire) that is turbulent with waves of **Parishad** (society).

If those noble souls are surrounded by a multitude of friends, they remain steadfast.  They are content with their own company, like a mountain range or a cave. || 80 ||

If those noble souls are in difficult and dangerous places, like mountain passes or cliffs, they remain steadfast. They are content with their own company, like a mountain range or a cave. || 81 ||

But what about those who are alone, without the support of others, and without the strength of companionship? Can they remain steadfast in the face of the afterlife? || 82 ||

The teachings of the Jinas are sweet and pleasant to hear. They are the true source of strength, and they can help us remain steadfast in the face of the afterlife. || 83 ||

The noble qualities of a courageous person, the company of good people, and the practice of the highest virtues are all sources of strength. They are content with their own company, like a mountain range or a cave. || 84 ||

**(Explanation of the benefits and drawbacks of unskillful and skillful actions)**

Those who engage in unskillful actions in their previous lives will experience suffering and misfortune in their next life. They will not be able to enjoy the pleasures of the senses. || 85 ||

Those who engage in unskillful actions at the time of death will not be able to overcome the suffering of the afterlife. They will not be able to enjoy the pleasures of the senses. || 86 ||

Those who engage in skillful actions at the time of death will be able to overcome the suffering of the afterlife. They will be able to enjoy the pleasures of the senses. || 87 ||

Those who engage in skillful actions throughout their lives will be able to overcome the suffering of the afterlife. They will be able to enjoy the pleasures of the senses. || 88 ||

Those who have accumulated good karma will be able to escape the suffering of the afterlife. They will be able to enjoy the pleasures of the senses. || 89 ||

**(Atmarth Sadhan Prarupana) (80-83)** If a virtuous person is free from desires and self-aware, they can attain the purpose of their soul (i.e., attain liberation) by going to a cave in the mountains. And if they are intelligent and equipped with practice, they can attain the purpose of their soul (i.e., attain liberation) by residing in a cave in the mountains, mountainous terrain, and similarly in difficult and inaccessible places. Then why wouldn't it be possible for them to attain the purpose of their soul (i.e., Atmarth) in the afterlife with the help of the virtuous and through mutual inspiration? While living among the virtuous, by listening to the sweet words of the Jinas with their ears, a virtuous person is certainly capable of attaining the purpose of their soul. (4) Those who attain the difficult Atmarth, which is expounded by patient men and worshipped by virtuous men, while residing on a stone slab, are blessed. 

**(Akritayog and Kritayog Gun-Dosha Prarupana) (85)** An extroverted person with a broken character, unrefined, and without previous practice, even if learned, becomes impatient at the time of death. A soul that has not practiced yoga before and is attached to worldly pleasures, even if desiring samadhi, is not able to bear the trials at the time of death. (87) Only a soul that has practiced yoga before and is not attached to worldly pleasures, even if desiring samadhi, is able to bear the trials at the time of death. (88) A person who has practiced yoga before and has become wise, free from the desire for future fruits, and with subdued passions, embraces death willingly (i.e., they are not disturbed by the sight of death). (89) For one who is inclined towards equanimity through penance, it is possible to transcend the sins of the wicked and their own good deeds.

One who abandons the death of a wise person is a good person, not a fool. He is free from the death of a wise person, there is no end to him, he is infinite. || 90 ||
What is the death of a wise person? What are the supports and the words? | What do the wise ones like to call it? || 91 ||
The support is the non-attachment, the understanding, the meditation, and the contemplation. The wise ones like to call this the death of a wise person. || 92 ||

The pleasures of the senses are a great danger, they are the cause of suffering and rebirth. One who is free from these actions is liberated at the time of death. || 93 ||
One who is ashamed of his body, who is proud of his body, or who is arrogant, is not a true seeker. || 94 ||

**(92)** Anashan and Prayopgamana (are Panditmaran) and Dhyana and Bhavanas (Anuprekshaas) are its supports. Knowing these, the Acharyas praise Panditmaran.

**(Anaaradhak Swarup)**

**(93)** The person who is engrossed in sensual pleasures, defeated by terrible trials, attached to objects, unrefined and impatient, becomes distracted during the time of Aradhana (i.e., at the time of Samadhimaran).

**(94)** Those who do not reveal their bad character to the Guru due to the ego of shame, pride and being well-versed, are not Aaradhaks.

**(Aradhana Mahatmya)**

**(95)** The one who performs severe austerities becomes pure, and the one who knows the path of Sadhana attains fame. And the one who criticizes his own offenses, his Aradhana is auspicious.

**(Vishuddha Mana Pradhanya)**

**(96)** Neither a bed of grass nor a bed of earth is the cause of Samadhimaran. The one whose mind is pure, his soul is the true savior (from the ocean of Samsara).

**(Pramdadosha Prarupana)**

(98) When a person is heedless, devoid of Jina-vacana, and inattentive, then the thieves in the form of senses destroy (steal) tapas and restraint.
(Samvara Mahatmya)

(99) Just as fire with wind burns a tree completely from root to tip, similarly, when the intellect, following Jina-vacana, enters the state of samvara, it destroys karma completely.

(100) Just as fire with wind burns trees and lush forests, similarly, a wise person, endowed with purushartha, knowing karma, destroys them.
(Jnana-Pradhanya Prarupana)

(101) The vast karma that an ignorant person destroys over millions of years, a wise person, endowed with trigunas, destroys in a single breath.

(102) Certainly, even a knower of the twelve types of Shruta-skandha, when near death, cannot properly renounce them with a resolute mind.

## Mahaatyayana Prakirnak 27

**Liberation** is attained by one who is free from passions (āsakti), while one who is attached to passions wanders endlessly in the cycle of births and deaths. (Faith in Jainism)

**(107)** I have faith in this right path (samyak dharma) as exemplified by the liberated ones (vītarāga) in all three ways (i.e., mind, speech, and body). This path is beneficial for all living beings, both mobile and immobile, and is the path to liberation (nirvāṇa).

**(Various Renunciations)**

**(108)** Firstly, I am an ascetic (śramaṇa) and secondly, I am completely restrained (samyata). Therefore, I renounce everything that is forbidden by the Jinas.

**(109)** I renounce with full awareness, through mind, speech, and body, all attachments (upadhi), the body, and the four types of food.

**(110)** The practitioner should renounce, through all three ways (i.e., mind, speech, and body), all forbidden actions that are not worthy of thought, speech, or action.

**(Attaining Samadhi through Renunciation)**

**(111)** In times of adversity, the practitioner should renounce unrestraint, contemplate on attachments (upadhi), and cultivate the feeling of calmness (upasama). They should refrain from actions of the mind, speech, and body that are not right, and maintain awareness of forgiveness (kṣamā) and detachment (vairāgya).

**(112)** In times of adversity, the practitioner attains samadhi by accepting these and other renunciations with a sense of urgency.

**(Becoming a Devotee by Taking Refuge in and Renouncing the One-Step Path of Arhant, etc.)**

**(113)** If a monk (muni) attains the end of time (i.e., death) by renouncing in this way, they attain samadhi through this single step of renunciation.

**Mahapaccakklanapainvaayam**

My auspicious Arihantas, Siddhas, Sadhus, and Dharma, I take refuge in them. I declare this to be auspicious. ||114||

Arihantas are auspicious to me, Arihantas are divine to me. I declare this to be auspicious for all Arihantas. ||115||

Siddhas are auspicious to me, Siddhas are divine to me. I declare this to be auspicious for all Siddhas. ||116||

Ayariyas are auspicious to me, Ayariyas are divine to me. I declare this to be auspicious for all Ayariyas. ||117||

Ujjhaayas are auspicious to me, Ujjhaayas are divine to me. I declare this to be auspicious for all Ujjhaayas. ||118||

Sadhus are auspicious to me, Sadhus are divine to me. I declare this to be auspicious for all Sadhus. ||119||

The Siddha, the perfect Arihanta, is the only one who is free from all attachments. This is the only way to attain liberation. ||120||

(Veyanahiyasanovaseso) The Muni, who is free from all attachments, does not think about anything. What can cause suffering to a Muni who is free from all attachments? ||121||

What is there for me to lament about in the face of suffering? What is there to cling to? What is there to suffer from? ||122||

The suffering of the highest beings is the highest suffering. I have realized this through my own experience. ||123||

I have done this karma, I have accumulated this karma. I have realized this through my own experience. ||124||

Therefore, I am free from all suffering. I do not think about life, non-life, or the past. ||125||

1. 'Ocinna' is a Sanskrit word.

Page #94:
---------------------------
**The Mahapratyakhyana Prakirnak (114)**

Arhant, Siddha, Sadhu, Shrutagyan and Dharma are auspicious for me.
By taking refuge in them, I abandon sinful actions. (115) Arhant is auspicious for me and Arhant is worthy of my worship. Remembering Arhants, I abandon sinful actions. (116) Siddha is auspicious for me and Siddha is worthy of my worship. Remembering Siddhas, I abandon sinful actions. (117) Acharya is auspicious for me and Acharya is worthy of my worship. Remembering Acharyas, I abandon sinful actions. (118) Upadhyaya is auspicious for me and Upadhyaya is worthy of my worship. Remembering Upadhyayas, I abandon sinful actions. (119) Sadhu is auspicious for me and Sadhu is worthy of my worship. Remembering Sadhus, I abandon sinful actions. (120) Thus, with devotion, taking refuge in any one of these - Siddha, Arhant, and Kevali - a person becomes a devotee in this world.

**(Teaching on Enduring Pain)** (121) When pain arises, what should a Shraman think with his heart?
The Muni takes refuge and only by taking refuge does he endure pain. (122) When pain arises, what should be said to the being (the creature)? It is because of refuge that you have obtained this pain. Therefore, endure it with equanimity. (123) The pains of those existing in the last hell are extremely (painful). Due to being under the influence of carelessness, I have obtained (that state) countless times. (124) These (cruel) actions have been done by me because of being ignorant. In the past, I have also done these actions many times. (125) Due to doing those (cruel) actions, I have obtained those painful consequences. These are the actions of the living being, not of the non-living being. One should think like this.

## Chapter 32: The Great Liberation of the Five Great Vows

**(Liberation from the Cycle of Rebirth and Destruction of Karma)**

"Do not desire much, O soul! Live long, die quickly, or live a short time. If you wish to cross the ocean of the world, which is without shores,..." (135)

"...just as you wish to destroy all the fiery karmas, be a world-renowned person, endowed with the knowledge, faith, conduct, and character of the Jinas." (136)

**(The Fourfold Path and Its Threefold Fruits)**

"Knowledge, faith, and conduct are your fourfold path. This path has three fruits: the middle, the lower, and the highest." (137)

"The fourfold path, when practiced with the highest fruit, leads to the destruction of karma and liberation." (138)

"The fourfold path, when practiced with the lower fruit, leads to the destruction of karma and liberation in the heaven of the thirty-seven." (139)

**(Compassion for All Beings)**

"May I be well with all beings, may I have no hatred towards anyone. May I be well with all beings, may I be well with all beings." (140)

**(Praise for Dying with Courage)**

"One should die with courage, one should die with a warrior's spirit. Of the two deaths, it is better to die with courage." (141)

**(The Fruits of Observing the Five Great Vows)**

"By observing the five great vows, one becomes well-established in the right path. One becomes a god, a human, or a liberated soul." (142)

**The Great Liberation of the Five Great Vows is complete.**

Page #98:
---------------------------
(The Great Dispeller of Misery) (World-crossing and Karma-liberation Instruction) (135) (O seeker desirous of Samadhi-death!) If you desire to cross the great ocean of the world, do not think, "May I live for a long time or may I die soon." (136) (O seeker!) If you desire to be freed from all sinful karmas, be awakened with sincerity towards knowledge, perception, conduct, and the words of the Jinas. 
(The Distinction of Worship and its Fruits) (137) Worship is of four types (in relation to) perception, knowledge, conduct, and austerity. It is also of three types: excellent, moderate, and inferior. (138) By practicing the excellent practice of all four limbs of worship, the wise seeker becomes free from karma-dust and is liberated in the same existence. (139) The wise seeker who practices the inferior practice of all four limbs of worship, becomes liberated after taking seven or eight existences, undergoing pure transmigration. 
(Forgiveness of All Beings) (140) I have equanimity towards all beings, I have no animosity towards anyone. I forgive all beings, may all beings forgive me. 
(Praise of Calm Death) (141) The patient man dies, and the cowardly man also dies. Of these two deaths, dying with patience (i.e., dying with equanimity) is certainly better. 
(The Fruit of Following Renunciation) (142) By following this renunciation properly, the restrained seeker will either be a celestial being or a Siddha.

## Appendix: Specific Terms Used in the Mahapratyakhyana Prakirnak

**Aradhana:**  Aradhana is the practice of observing and upholding a virtuous path without committing any transgressions (doshas). There are three types of Aradhana: (1) Jnana Aradhana, (2) Darshan Aradhana, and (3) Charitra Aradhana.

According to Digambara literature, Aradhana is the proper cultivation, culmination, firm adherence, reawakening (when they weaken), and lifelong practice of Samyagdarshan, Samyagjnana, Samyagcharitra, and Samyagtap. Thus, in the Digambara tradition, Tap is also included in the category of Aradhana along with Jnana, Darshan, and Charitra.

**Aalocna (Criticism):** Due to the constantly arising and waning Kashayas, the Sadhaka's faith and character are affected by both known and unknown flaws. It is essential to eliminate these flaws for the purification of life. Aalocna is the best way to achieve this. Aalocna is the act of openly revealing all one's faults, both small and large, to an Acharya, Guru, or senior person.

**Aahar (Food):** The Agamas mention four types of food for humans: (1) Asan, (2) Pan, (3) Khady, and (4) Swady.

There, the fourth committee is called the Ādāna Nikṣepaṇa Samiti and the fifth committee is called the Pratiṣṭhāpana Samiti.
