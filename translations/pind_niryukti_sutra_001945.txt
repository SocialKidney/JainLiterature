The first commentary of the Agamas is the Nirukti literature. This literature, written in a concise style and in verse, is a valuable treasure of ancient Indian literature. In it, Acharya Bhadrabahu has presented a concise explanation of the special words used in the Agama texts. This commentary is extremely important from the perspective of the science of semantic development today.

Within the Nirukti literature, there is an important text related to the Pind-Nirukti Charanakarananuyoga. Written in a systematic and subject-oriented style, this text encompasses many topics related to the Sadhu's Bhikshacharya. Due to its nature as an Achar-related text, it is considered a primary source in some traditions. The present text elaborates on the faults of Udgaman, Utpadana, Eshana, and Paribhogaeshana in detail. This text is also extremely rich from the perspective of the contemporary civilization and culture. It is believed that this fourth flower in the chain of Nirukti literature will also be established and popular in the scholarly world.

**Antastosha**

Antastosha is indescribable, like the joy of a gardener who sees his nurtured and watered grove flourish with leaves, blossoms, and fruit; like the joy of an artist who sees the formless become form through his brush; and like the joy of a visionary who sees his imagination come to life through his efforts. For a long time, my mind was filled with the vision of a scholarly edition of the Jain Agamas, and I dedicated many laborious moments of my life to this endeavor. My resolve bore fruit, and it came to pass. With me as the center, my Dharma family became involved in this work, and therefore, I want to share this Antastosha with all those who have participated in this endeavor.

**Samvibhaga is our Dharma.** To all those who have selflessly dedicated their Samvibhaga to this momentous endeavor, I offer my blessings and wish that their future becomes the future of this great work.

Message

**Pindaniyukti Muni** - is an important text on conduct. It can be called a supplementary text to the fifth study of Dashavaikalik. There are many topics to be known about the Muni's diet method and diet purification, the नियुक्तिकार has planned them properly.

Muni Dulharajji has been working with dedication in the field of Agam and Agam's commentary literature. The translation of the presented text done by him will be very useful for the reader. Some lines of the efforts of Samani Kusumprajna have been marked in its editing work. This text is readable and contemplative for Sadhus and Sadhvis. It is also a very valuable text for curious readers of Muni's diet routine and conduct routine.

**Light of Knowledge**

The Jain Agamas hold a significant place in ancient Indian literature. Numerous new facts related to history, philosophy, society, culture, Ayurveda, geography, and astrology are scattered throughout this literature. To reveal the profound mysteries of the Agamas, the first commentary literature was written, named Nirukti. This literature, which explains the word or subject in a concise style using the method of deposition, contains many new facts within itself.

1
Acharya Tulsi's awakened wisdom dreamt of a well-organized compilation of the Agamas. Inspired by him, many enlightened saints, including his disciple Muni Nathmalji (present Acharya Mahapragya), joined this great endeavor, and gradually, around 100,000 pages of Agamic literature were edited and published, including the original text of the Agamas, commentaries, translations, and lexicons. Jain Vishva Bharati had the privilege of publishing this magnificent work, for which it is deeply grateful to the revered ones.

In today's convenience-oriented age, the arduous task of editing ancient texts from manuscripts holds special significance. Jain Vishva Bharati has already published two volumes of Nirukti literature. The second volume related to the necessary Nirukti is being published, and before that, the fourth volume, named Pindanirukti, is reaching the hands of scholars. The present Pindanirukti text deals with the faults related to the diet and begging practices of the Sadhus. This text also highlights many important cultural and social aspects incidentally. A significant aspect of the editing of this text is the attempt to separate the Nirukti and commentary, which are written in the same language and style. To make this text accessible to the public, the translation work was done by Agam Manishi Muni Shri Dulharajji. Earlier, Muni Shri had translated many voluminous texts. Even today, he is constantly engaged in the worship of Shruti like a steady yogi. Even in a state of physical ill health, his steady yoga keeps him focused on Agamic work.

Samani Kusumprajnaji has been involved in the editing of Agamic commentary literature for the past 28 years. Such work is impossible without subtle intellect, firm determination, intense concentration, and vibrant life energy. Samani Kusumprajnaji has not only provided textual variations from about 6 manuscripts but has also written many important footnotes. The 21 appendices included in the text highlight its importance.

Jain Vishva Bharati is extremely happy to publish this important text. Congratulating Muni Shri and Samani Ji for this momentous work, I wish that their journey of Shruti continues uninterrupted for the propagation of the Jain religion in the future, and Jain Vishva Bharati continues to deliver the ancient wisdom to the masses. The institution family hopes that this publication, like previous publications, will prove to be extremely useful in the eyes of scholars.

**Pinḍaniyukti:** A commentary known as the first exegetical literature of the Jain Āgamas. According to the Digambara tradition, the Āgama texts were lost over time, hence the Niyukti literature is only accepted in the Śvetāmbara tradition. The Śvetāmbara Mūrtipūjak tradition considers the Niyukti literature along with 45 Āgamas as authoritative, but the Sthānakavāsī and Terāpanthī traditions accept 11 Angas, 12 Upangas, 4 Mūlas, 4 Chhedas, and 1 Āvashyak - these 32 Āgamas as authoritative. The remaining Niyukti literature is not accepted as Āgama-authoritative.

**Nature of Niyukti:**
The first commentary on the Āgamas is Niyukti, hence it is not an independent scripture but is subject to its own sūtra. Just as Yāska explained the Vedic technical terms through Nirukta, similarly the Niyuktikāra explained the technical terms used in the Jain Āgamas through the Nikshepa method. In the Nikshepa method, the meaning of a word used in various fields is revealed, and it is revealed what its meaning is in the presented context. The Niyukti literature is written in Mahārāṣṭrī Prakrit language, it mainly uses Āryā chanda but sometimes Doha and Indravajra etc. chandas are also used.

Āchārya Bhadrabahu, while explaining the word Niyukti, says - 'Nijjuttā te atthā, jaṁ baddhā teṇ hoī nijjuttī' i.e. that by which the meaning assigned in the sūtra is decided, that is Niyukti. Certainly, the purpose of Niyukti is to decide the correct meaning and to reveal the interconnected meaning in the sūtra itself. According to Āchārya Haribhadra, explaining the word by action, agent, difference, and synonym or revealing the meaning is Nirukti-Niyukti. According to the German scholar Schantier, Niyuktis are primarily:
1. Mavṛ 1; Niruktayō na svatantra śāstrarūpāḥ, kintu tattatsūtraparatantraḥ.
2. Āvani 82.
3. (a) Vibhā 1086; Jaṁ nicchayaijuttā, sutte atthā imīe vakkhāyā.
Teṇeyam nijjuttī, nijjattathābhihānāō.
(b) Sūṭī p.1: Yojanam yuktiḥ arthaghaṭanā niścayena adhikyeṇa vā yuktirniyuktiḥ samyagarthaprakatanam.
Niruktanām vā sūtreṣveva parasparasambaddhānām arthānām āvirbhāvanam yuktaśabdalopānniyuktiḥ.
(c) Āvamṭī p. 100; Sūtrārthayoḥ parasparam niryojanam sambandhanam niyuktiḥ.
(d) Oniṭī p. 4; Ni:ādikye yojanam yuktiḥ sūtrārthayoḥ yogo nitya vyavasthita evāste vācyavācakatayeti arthah.
Adhikā yojanā niyuktirūcyate, niyatā niścitā vā yojanēti.
(e) Āvacū 1 p. 92 Suttanijjuttaththanijjūhaṇam nijjuttī.
4. Āvahāṭī Bhā. 1 p. 242.

**Pindianuyukti**

It acts as an index to the related text and briefly mentions all the detailed events. In the context of explanation, Anugam is of two types - Sutra-Anugam and Niyukti-Anugam. There are three types of Niyukti-Anugam:
1. Nikshepaniyukti-Anugam. 2. Upodhaatanniyukti-Anugam. 3. Sutrasparshikaniyukti-Anugam.

Nikshepaniyukti-Anugam helps in understanding which meaning of the word is relevant in the given context. In Upodhaatanniyukti-Anugam, the word or topic is discussed in twenty-six ways. Thereafter, the Niyuktikar presents the explanation of the words in the Sutra through Sutrasparshikaniyukti-Anugam. The Niyuktikar does not explain every word of the original text, but only presents the explanation of specific words.

Three types of explanations have been mentioned in the Bhashya literature, in which Niyukti is the second. In the first explanation, the student is only taught the meaning of the Sutra, in the second explanation, the Sutra is explained along with Niyukti, and in the third explanation, a complete and comprehensive explanation is given. Here, the second meaning of 'Nijjuttimiaso' is also possible that in the second explanation, the student is taught the meaning of the Sutra, which is called Arthagam. The purpose of Niyukti

A question naturally arises that when Arthagam is associated with each Sutra, then why was there a need to write Niyukti separately? In answer to this question, the Niyuktikar himself says, 'Tah Vi Ya Ichchaveti Vibhasitum Suttaparivadi' Even when the meaning is clear in the Sutra, Niyukti is being created to explain the Sutra method to the students in various ways. While explaining this verse of Aavashyakniyukti, it has been said in Visheshvaavashyak Bhashya that the meaning is bound in the Shrutaparipati
1. Uttaradhyayana Sutra, Preface, Page 50, 51. 2. Vibha 972; Nijjutti Tivi Gappa, Nasovaggaay-Suttvakkhanam. 3. Vibha 973, 974. 4. Vibha 566; Suttattho Khalu Padhamo, Bio Nijjattimiaso Bhanio.
Taiyo Ya Niravaseso, Es Vihi Hoi Anuoge. The present verse of Visheshvaavashyak Bhashya is also found in Bhagavati 25/97, but it seems to have been interpolated in Bhagavati later. 5. Avani 82

Page #21:
---------------------------
**Pinḍaniyukti:** This is an observation, therefore, the appointing Ācārya, who does not desire to express meaning, is driven towards the revelation of meaning by the tradition itself in order to bestow grace upon the listeners. By way of example, the commentator says that just as a painter explains the story depicted on his canvas and presents its interpretation with the help of a stick or finger, in the same way, the appointing Ācārya expresses the meaning of the sūtras through the medium of appointment in order to make each meaning easily understood. Jinabhadragaṇi Kṣamāśramaṇa has given the second meaning of the word 'icchāve' as follows: a dull-witted disciple, due to not understanding the correct meaning of the sūtra, inspires the guru to explain the sūtra. Ācārya Haribhadra has also given the same explanation.

In conclusion, it can be said that appointments through the method of niṣkṣepa are an important commentary literature for explaining the special words of Jain Āgamas and determining their meaning.

**Number of Appointments:**

Nothing definite can be said about the number of appointments because in the Nandi Sūtra, where an introduction to each Āgama is found, there is a mention of countless appointments on each of the eleven angas. Here, the word 'asankhyeya' can be understood in two contexts: either many appointments were written on each anga or the number of verses of the appointments written on a single anga was not fixed. The question arises: what were these appointments? One possibility for its solution is that the sūtrakar himself would have written appointments along with the sūtra. These appointments can only be called arthāgama. Haribhadra has also called the mutual arrangement of sūtra and meaning as appointment. From this point of view, the meaning of 'sankejjāo nijjuttīo' seems more appropriate that the arthāgama written by the sūtrakar himself on the sūtrāgama were called appointments at that time. The second option is also possible that Nandikara may have mentioned 'sankejjāo nijjuttīo' in the introduction of Ācārāṅga and Sūtrakṛtāṅga, but later, due to the uniformity of the text, the text 'sankejjāo nijjuttīo' got attached to all the anga Āgamas.

1. Vibhā 1088; So suyaparivāḍicciya, icchāve'i tamaṇicchāmaṇam pi.
Nijjutte vi tadatthe, vottuṁ tadanuṭṭaghaṭṭhāe. 2. Vibhā 1089; Falayalihiyam pi maṅkho, paḍhai pabhāsai taha kara'ihiṁ.
Dāe'i ya paivaththu, suhabōhatthaṁ taha ihaṁ pi. 3. Vibhā 1091; Icchha vibhāsi'uṁ me, suyaparivāḍiṁ na suṭṭha bujḍḍhāmi.
Nātima'i vā sīsō, gurumiṭṭhāve'i vottuṁ je. 4. Āvahāṭī 1 p. 45. 5. Nandi 81-91.

The Pindanuyukti is gone. The currently available literature on the subject does not seem to have any connection with the Nandy Sutra's mention of the Nuyukti.
Acharya Bhadrabahu has promised to write 10 Nuyuktis in the Avashyak Nuyukti. The order in which these Nuyuktis are written is as follows: 1. Avashyak 2. Dasha Vaikalik 3. Uttara Adhyayan 4. Acharang 5. Sutra Kritang 6. Dasha Shruta Skandh 7. Brihat Kalp 8. Vyavahar 9. Surya Prajnapti 10. Rishi Bhashit. Haribhadra has also mentioned the Nuyukti of Devendrastava etc. in the explanation of the word 'Ishibhasianam cha'. Currently, only eight of these ten Nuyuktis are available. It seems likely that Bhadrabahu promised to write ten Nuyuktis in the Avashyak Nuyukti but was unable to create the last two. Another possibility is that, like other Agam literature, some Nuyuktis have also been lost over time. In this context, Dr. Sagarmalji Jain's opinion is worth reading: "It seems that after seeing some mentions in the Surya Prajnapti that are contrary to Jain moral principles and the mention of controversial figures like Narada, Mankhali Gaushalak etc. in the Rishi Bhashit, Acharya Bhadrabahu may have postponed the idea of writing Nuyukti on them even after promising to do so. Or it is also possible that Nuyuktis were written on these two texts but due to the mention of controversial topics, they were kept out of reading and study, and as a result, they became extinct over time due to neglect."
In addition, there is also independent existence of Pindanuyukti, Oghanuyukti, Panchkalpanuyukti and Nishthanuyukti etc. According to Dr. Ghatge, these are supplementary Nuyuktis of Dasha Vaikalik Nuyukti, Avashyak Nuyukti, Brihat Kalp Nuyukti and Acharang Nuyukti respectively, but the point to be considered is whether these Nuyukti texts are supplementary or independent works. Pindanuyukti is an independent work, its detailed discussion will be done in the introduction later.
Oghanuyukti cannot be called a supplement to Avashyak Nuyukti because the entire chapter of Asvadhyayan Nuyukti in Avashyak Nuyukti is in Oghanuyukti. If it were a supplementary text to Avashyak Nuyukti, there would not have been so many verses repeated. Detailed thinking about this will be done in the fifth volume of Nuyukti literature.

**Pinḍaniyukti: An Observation**

Some scholars consider Niśītha niyukti as a supplement to Ācārāṅga niyukti, but Niśītha niyukti was composed independently after Ācārāṅga niyukti because Ācārya Bhadrabahu wrote a very concise niyukti of the four chūlās of Ācārāṅga, but Niśītha niyukti is written in a very detailed style. The niyuktikāra himself expresses his intention in the niyukti of the fourth chūlā of Ācārāṅga that after the fourth chūlā of Ācārāṅga, I will now speak about the fifth Niśītha chūlā. This statement of his automatically proves the separate existence of the text. Otherwise, he would have composed it along with the Ācārāṅga niyukti without mentioning it.

Looking at the difference in the style of composition of Niśītha niyukti, it can be said that Bhadrabahu II may have expanded it and established its independent importance. While Ācārya Bhadrabahu vows to write ten niyuktis, Niśītha is not mentioned. This is the starting point of contemplation. More research is needed in this area. Detailed speculation about this will be done in the sixth volume of niyukti literature.

Pancakalpana niyukti cannot be considered a supplement to Bṛhatkalpa either. It seems more likely that Ācārya Bhadrabahu has included both Pancakalpa and Bṛhatkalpa niyuktis in the mention of the word 'k appa' in 'k appao tah dasāṇam cha'.

Currently, the niyuktis written on Sūryaprajñapti and Ṛṣibhāṣita and Ārādhanā niyukti are unavailable. Manuscript copies of Saṃsakta niyukti are available, but it has not been published yet. There is a lot of difference in the verses and text in its copies. It mentions 84 āgamas, hence scholars consider it a later and inconsistent composition. A copy of Maheśa niyukti is also found in the Gadhaiya manuscript repository of Sardarshahar, but it is a matter of research as to when and by whom it was written on which text?

In addition to these niyuktis, mention of Govinda niyukti written by Govinda Ācārya is also found in many places. This will be discussed in detail in the introduction.

It cannot be said clearly about the definite number of other niyuktis besides the niyuktis mentioned by Ācārya Bhadrabahu. Niyukti-gāthās written on independent subjects have also been separated from the original niyukti and given the name of independent niyukti, such as - Āvśyaka niyukti is a vast 1.

##  10. Pinḍaniyukti (Arrangement of Texts)

This is a composition. Its six studies have independent existence with different names. Below are some names and their inclusion in which niyukti is mentioned.

**Āvashyakaniyukti (Essential Arrangement)**
1. Sāmaiyanijjutti
2. Logassujjoyanijjutti
3. Ṇamokkāranijjutti
4. Pariṭṭhāvaṇiyanijjutti
5. Paccakkhāṇanijjutti
6. Asajjhaianijjutti
7. Samosaraṇanijjutti
8. Kappaniyjutti

**Brihatkalpa and Daśāśrutaskandhaniyukti (Arrangement of the Ten Chapters of the Śruta)**
9. Pajjosavaṇākappaniyjutti

In addition to these, the niyuktis written on the Jaina Āgamas have different names based on their different studies. For example, in Ācārāṅganiyukti, the names like Satthaparinnānijjutti, Mahāparinnānijjutti, and Dhūyanijjutti are mentioned.

Currently available niyuktis are found independently, such as Ācārāṅga and Sūtrakrtaṅga niyuktis. Some niyuktis have short commentaries on their partial parts, such as Daśavaikālika and Uttarādhyayana niyuktis. Some niyuktis have Brihad-bhāṣya (extensive commentary), but both have independent existence, such as Āvashyakaniyukti, Oghanīyukti, etc. Some niyuktis have become a single text with the commentary, which is very difficult to separate today, such as Niśītha, Vyavahāra, Brihatkalpa, etc.

**Order of Niyukti Composition**

In Āvashyakaniyukti, Ācārya Bhadravāhu has vowed to write ten niyuktis. Pandit Dalasukh Bhai Malvaṇiya believes that the niyuktis were composed in the same order in which Bhadravāhu vowed to write them in Āvashyakaniyukti. Some reasons can be presented in support of this statement:

1. In Ācārāṅganiyukti, verse 177 mentions "Logo Bhaṇio". This indicates that Āvashyakaniyukti was written before Ācārāṅganiyukti.
2. Oghanīyukti and its commentary are published separately, but the verses of the niyukti and the commentary have merged. This will be discussed in the fifth chapter of the niyukti.
3. Gaṇadharavāda, pages 13-14.

## Pinḍaniyukti: An Observation

**(Gā. 682, 6831)** This points towards the explanation of the *Logassa* text in the *Caturviṁśatistava*.

2. The mention of *“Āyare angammi ya puvvuṭṭiō”* is found in the *Ācārāṅganiyukti* (Gā. 5). The *Daśavaikālika*’s *Kṣullakācāra* study appointment (Gā. 154-61) and the *Ācāra* and *Uttarādhyayana*’s *Caturangīya* study appointment (Gā. 144-58) provide a detailed description of the word *anga*. This makes it clear that the *Daśavaikālika* and *Uttarādhyayana* appointments were composed before the *Ācārāṅga*.

3. The mention of *“Viṇao puvubuddivo”* (Gā. 29) in the *Uttarādhyayana* appointment points towards the *Daśavaikālika*’s *Vinayasamādhi* appointment (Gā. 286-303). This quote makes it clear that the *Uttarādhyayana* appointment was composed after the *Daśavaikālika*.

4. The quote *“Kāma puvvuṭṭhiā”* (Gā. 200) in the *Uttarādhyayana* appointment points towards the explanation of the word *“Kāma”* described in the *Daśavaikālikaniyukti* (Gā. 137-41). This makes it clear that the *Daśavaikālikaniyukti* was composed before the *Uttarādhyayana*.

5. The mention of *“Āyār-sutan bhaṇiyam”* in the *Sūtrakṛtāṅganiyukti* (Gā. 183) makes it clear that the *Daśavaikālika* and *Uttarādhyayana* appointments were composed before it, because the description of *Ācāra* is found in *Daśani* (Gā. 154-61) and the description of *Śruta* is found in *Uni* (Gā. 29).

6. Some verses explaining *Karaṇa* described in the *Uttarādhyayana* appointment are found in the *Sūtrakṛtāṅganiyukti*.

7. The mention of *“Gantho puvvuḍdiddyo”* (Gā. 127) in the *Sūtrakṛtāṅganiyukti* points towards the explanation of the word *“Grantha”* described in the *Uttarādhyayana* appointment (Gā. 234-37). This quote makes it clear that the *Uttarādhyayana* appointment was composed before the *Sūtrakṛtāṅganiyukti*.

8. The mention of *“Jah vakkaṁ tah bhāsā”* described in the *Ācārāṅganiyukti* (Gā. 336) points towards the *Daśavaikālika*’s *Vakkasuddhi* study appointment (Gā. 245-58).

9. The mention of *“Dhammo puvubuddiṭṭo”* in the *Sūtrakṛtāṅganiyukti* (Gā. 99) points towards the explanation of the word *“Dharma”* described in the *Daśavaikālikaniyukti* (Gā. 36-40). This makes it clear that the *Sūtrakṛtāṅganiyukti* was composed later.

10. The mention of *“Jo cev hoti mokkho, sā u vimutti pagayam”* in the *Ācārāṅganiyukti* (Gā. 365) points towards the explanation of *Mokṣa* described in the *Uttarādhyayana* appointment (Gā. 491-94).

The above mentions make it clear that the order of composition of the appointments is the same as the order in which they pledged to write the appointments. 

1. This number is from the *Āvaśyakaniyukti* volume 2, published by Jain Vishva Bharati.

## 12. The Appointment of Acharya Govinda and His Appointment

In addition to the appointments written by Acharya Bhadrabahu, the mention of Govindanuyukti, written by Acharya Govinda, is found in many places. In the *Aavashyak Niyukti*, it is mentioned as a *darshanaprabhavak* (influential in philosophy) text. In the *Nishith Churni*, Acharya Govinda is introduced as follows:

Govinda was a Buddhist monk. He was defeated eighteen times in debates by a Jain Acharya. Grieving over his defeat, he contemplated that he could not win until he understood their principles. Therefore, with the desire to defeat them, he requested initiation from the same Acharya to gain knowledge. While studying *Samayik* etc., Govinda the monk attained *samyaktv* (right faith). The Guru gave him *mahavrata-diksha* (initiation into the highest vows). After being initiated, Govinda the monk simply explained the purpose of his initiation to his Guru. His purpose of being initiated was not *samyak* (right faith), therefore he was called *gyan-sten* (one who steals knowledge).

In the *Brihatkalpa Bhashya*, he is not mentioned as *gyan-sten*. He was initiated to write *Govindanuyukti* containing *hetu-shastra* (logic) and to obtain knowledge and mantras, according to the *Bhashyakar* (commentator) and *tikakar* (commentator) Malayagiri. The same mention is found in the *Nishith Bhashya* and *Panchkalpa Bhashya*. In the *Vyavahar Bhashya*, he is mentioned as a *mithyatvi* (false believer). There are examples of four types of *mithyatvis*, among them Govinda Acharya was a *mithyatvi* due to his previous *agrah* (attachment). In the *Thanam Sutra*, Govinda Acharya is mentioned as being initiated due to his special desire, among the ten reasons for *pravrajya* (renunciation).

According to the *Sthaviravali* of the *Nandi Sutra*, he belonged to the fourth generation of Arya Skandil. In the *Nandi Sutra*, he is presented as a *vipula anuyogadharak* (one who holds vast knowledge of the *anuyog* - scriptures), *kshanthi-daya* (compassionate) and *utkrusht prarupkak* (excellent speaker):

"Govindaanang pi namo, anuyogge viul dharinindaanang.
Niccham kshanthi dayaang, paruvana dullhabhindaang."

In *Govindanuyukti*, he attempted to prove the existence of *jivattva* (soul) in *ekendriya jivas* (one-sensed beings). This *niyukti*...

##  Pinḍaniyukti: An Observation

There is no mention of Pinḍaniyukti in the fourth study of Daśavaikālika, based on the sixth chapter of Chhajjivaṇiyā, or in the first study of Ācārāṅga, Śastra-parijñā. The Daśavaikālika mentions only "Govindavāyago vi ya, jah parapphakhaṁ niyatteï mātra".

This Pinḍaniyukti appears to be written based on the first study of Ācārāṅga, Śastra-parijñā. Some reasons for this are:

* In the context of the existence of Apkāya, Ācārāṅga Chūrṇi mentions, "Jan cha ninjuttiē āukkāyajīvalakkhaṇaṁ, jancha ajjagovindēhi bhaṇiyaṁ gāhā" (2). This quote clearly indicates that they wrote the Pinḍaniyukti based on the first study of Ācārāṅga.
* In the Ācārāṅga Sutra, Bhagavān Mahāvīra mentions many sutras about the existence of these sthāvarakāyas, while Daśavaikālika only discusses their non-violence. Ācārāṅganiyukti also contains some gāthās about the existence of sthāvarakāyas. It is possible that Ācārya Bhadravāhu took some gāthās from Govindaniyukti, as Govindaācārya was before Bhadravāhu II. Both the Daśavaikālika chūrṇis also mention this gāthā with the name of Govindaācārya:

> Kāye vi hu ajjhappam, sarīra-vāyasamannīyaṁ cheva.
> Kāya-maṇasampauttaṁ, ajjhappam kinchidāhaṁsu.

Although no independent text called Govindaniyukti is found today, based on the available facts, it can be said that Govindaācārya wrote Govindaniyukti, which is now unavailable.

## Authorship and Time of Composition of Pinḍaniyukti

There is no consensus yet on who the original author of the Niyukti literature was, despite many speculations. Was it Bhadravāhu I or II? In ancient times, the absence of mention of the author and time of composition in the copies makes it difficult to determine the author of a particular text today. This is also the case with an important text like Pinḍaniyukti. Ācārya Malayagiri, in his commentary on Pinḍaniyukti, and Dronācārya, in his commentary on Oghanīyukti, mention Chaturdaśapūrvi Bhadravāhu as the author.

In the Niśītha Chūrṇi, for Pinī 199 under Dhātrīpiṇḍa, it is mentioned, "Esa Bhaddabāhukayā ṇijjuttigāhā" (NiChū 3, p. 407). Similarly, for Pinī 205, Niśītha Chūrṇi (NiChū 3, p. 411) mentions, "Imā Bhaddabāhukayā gāhā". This mention clearly indicates that Ācārya Bhadravāhu wrote Pinḍaniyukti, but it is not clear whether it was Chaturdaśapūrvi Bhadravāhu I who wrote it.

## Chapter 14: Piṇḍaniyukti

**Or, the Second Bhadrabahu?** A detailed discussion regarding the antiquity and authorship of the Niyukti literature will be presented in the next forthcoming section of the Niyukti literature.

According to Dr. Sagarmal Jain, the fourteenth पूर्वी Ācārya Bhadrabahu lived long ago, and the Second Bhadrabahu lived much later. Therefore, there must have been another Ācārya named Bhadrabahu in between. According to him, Āryabhadra of the Gautama gotra, who lived in the second century CE, can be considered the author of the Niyuktis. There is also an inscription from the fifth century CE that mentions Bhadraanvaya. Since he is the only Ācārya whose authorship would make the time of the Niyukti composition fit, he can be considered the author. However, this argument cannot be fully accepted because there is no similarity between the names Āryabhadra and Bhadrabahu. Nevertheless, his opinion compels us to think in this direction.

The earliest mention of Piṇḍaniyukti is found in the Daśavaikalika Cūrṇi by Jinadas. This mention suggests that the Piṇḍaniyukti was composed before the Cūrṇikāra Jinadas Gaṇi, because the Cūrṇi literature is considered to be from the sixth and seventh centuries CE. According to Dr. Sagarmal Jain, there is no specific information in the Niyukti literature after the second century CE. Therefore, the Second Bhadrabahu cannot be its author.

The entire section related to the faults of origin, production, and burning has been transferred from the Piṇḍaniyukti to the Mūlācāra. Some Digambara scholars also accept this. Based on this argument, it can be assumed that the Piṇḍaniyukti must have been composed before the Mūlācāra. Some verses related to the faults of production have been transferred from the Piṇḍaniyukti to the Niśītha Bhāṣya. Based on this, its time of composition is also proven to be earlier.

In the ten Niyuktis promised in the Āvश्यक Niyukti, the names Piṇḍaniyukti and Oghanīyukti are not mentioned. This suggests that after or before composing the ten Niyuktis, Ācārya Bhadrabahu composed two independent texts to expound the dietary and general conduct of a muni, which he named Piṇḍaniyukti and Oghanīyukti.

The question may arise as to why he did not mention them in the ten Niyuktis? The solution to this is that there, Ācārya Bhadrabahu is making a vow to compose Niyukti literature based on the vast knowledge of the scriptures expounded by the Tīrthankaras and Ācāryas, not to compose any independent text. Therefore, he mentioned the Niyuktis written on the Ācārāṅga and other sūtras.

**Piṇḍaniyukti: A Commentary**

It is possible to suggest that the two appointments, which were composed as independent texts, were not included under the vow. However, both these texts are fully qualified to be independent texts in terms of subject matter and size. 

Furthermore, the detailed description of the rules of the Muni's begging practice available in it also suggests that its time is contemporary with all other appointments. It can be said that the verses that reveal the exception in both Piṇḍa and Oga appointments are later mixed by the commentators or other Acharyas.

Nandinī Sūtrakara has given a list of many texts under Kālika and Utkalika Sūtras, but there is no mention of Piṇḍaniyukti and Oghanīyukti anywhere. It is surprising that he did not include these two important texts in the list of texts, even though they had been composed by that time. There are two possible solutions to this question: Firstly, these texts were not so famous until the time of Devardhigaṇī Kṣamāśramaṇa. They did not mention it because it was under the commentary literature like other appointments. Secondly, it is possible that some later Acharyas included these two texts under the original literature because they were the proponents of the original conduct of the Sadhu.

**The Independent Existence of Piṇḍaniyukti**

Piṇḍaniyukti has an important place in the Āgama and its commentary literature. It is an original and independent text written on the Muni's begging practice and diet. The importance of this text can be gauged from the fact that the German scholar Layman was the first to publish this text in the German language.

Professor H.R. Kapadia has mentioned that Bhavaprabhasūri was the first to mention four original Sūtras in Jain Dharmavarastotra: 1. Uttarādhyayana 2. Āvश्यक 3. Piṇḍaniyukti and Oghanīyukti 4. Daśavaikālika. Scholars like Professor Winternitz have considered Piṇḍaniyukti as an original Sūtra along with Uttarādhyayana, Āvश्यक and Daśavaikālika. Due to the description related to Sadhvācāra, it is sometimes counted under the Chhedasūtras.

Some scholars consider Piṇḍaniyukti as the fifth study of the Daśavaikālika appointment, Piṇḍaiṣaṇā niyukti.

##  Chapter 16: Pinḍaniryukti

**Supporters** believe that due to its large size, Pinḍaniryukti was later given the status of an independent text. Malayagiri himself mentions in the beginning of the text that the Dasavaikalika was compiled by Bhadrabahu Swami, the fourteenth predecessor. Due to the vastness of the fifth study, called Piṇḍaiṣaṇā, it was established independently and named Piṇḍaniryukti. This statement by Acharya Malayagiri clearly suggests that by his time, Piṇḍaniryukti was considered a supplementary text to the Dasavaikalika.

Acharya Malayagiri further argues that it is not an independent text because there is no mangalacharan (invocation) at the beginning of Piṇḍaniryukti. This is because the Dasavaikalika already has a mangalacharan at its beginning.

In this context, it can be argued that the tradition of mangalacharan began later. In ancient times, authors would begin their texts with a sangrahani gatha (summary verse). The mangalacharan gatha in the Dasavaikalika was also added later. This is evident from the fact that both the chūrṇikāras (commentators) neither mentioned nor explained the mangalacharan gatha. The mangalacharan gatha is only found in the Haribhadriya tika (commentary). It is highly likely that the first mangalacharan gatha of the Dasavaikalika was added later by Bhadrabahu II or the commentator, which became famous as the niryukti gatha by the time of Acharya Haribhadra.

Similarly, the chūrṇikāra has not indicated or explained the mangalacharan gatha of the Ācārāṅga niryukti. There is a mention of "Esa bitiya gaha" for the third gatha. This clearly indicates that the mangalacharan gatha of the Ācārāṅga niryukti did not exist during the time of the chūrṇikāra. Additionally, the beginning of the Cheda (sections) and Mūlasūtras (original texts) also do not start with a mangalacharan. The tradition of mangalacharan is around the second or third century Vikram era.

Apart from Malayagiri's commentary, there is no mention of this anywhere else. Therefore, it is clear that Piṇḍaniryukti cannot be considered a part of the Dasavaikalika niryukti based on this single mention.

Despite being a supplementary text to the Dasavaikalika sūtra, Piṇḍaniryukti is an independent text, which can be supported by some arguments:

The entire text of Piṇḍaniryukti is expanded based on the first sangrahani gatha. Therefore, attention...

1. Mavṛ p. 1; The Dasavaikalika and its niryukti were compiled by Bhadrabahu Swami, the fourteenth predecessor. Due to the vastness of the fifth study, called Piṇḍaiṣaṇā, it was established independently as another text, and named Piṇḍaniryukti.
2. Mavṛ p. 1; There is no invocation at the beginning, as it is part of the Dasavaikalika niryukti, and the invocation of the latter would suffice to ward off obstacles. The rest of the niryukti is established as the Dasavaikalika niryukti.
3. The Niryukti Panchak text, published by Jain Vishva Bharati, discusses this in detail.

**Pinḍaniryukti: An Observation**

17

It is clear from reading that this is an independent composition, not a supplement to the fifth study of Daśavaikālika. Looking at the final verse of the Piṇḍaniryukti text, it also appears that it was composed as an independent text and concluded in the same way.

If this text were a supplement, then the mention of "Vattavā Piṇḍanijjutti" would not be found in the Daśavaikālika niryukti. This mention indicates that in order to understand the reasonable meaning in relation to the Piṇḍa, Piṇḍaniryukti should be said here. Otherwise, no author would mention the word "Vattavā", just as after writing the niryukti of the four chūlās in the Ācārāṅga niryukti, the niryuktikāra has clearly mentioned that "Pancama Chūlanisīham, Tassa Ya Uvariṁ Bhaṇīhāmi" (Āni 366), meaning I will speak of the niryukti of the fifth chūla later. Similarly, when Piṇḍaniryukti was separated from Daśavaikālikaniryukti, the author would certainly have mentioned something in this context, but such a mention is neither found in Piṇḍaniryukti nor in Daśavaikālika niryukti. Therefore, it must be an independent text. Ancient scribes and authors would often mention many verses in the margins as "Jaha Āvassaē", "Jaha Ovavaiē", etc. Since Piṇḍaniryukti presents a comprehensive material on the dietary and begging practices of the sadhu, there was no better text to understand Piṇḍaiṣaṇā, therefore, it was mentioned in the niryukti of the fifth study of Daśavaikālika niryukti that the entire Piṇḍaniryukti should be said here. Initially, it was mentioned as a supporting text from the point of view of subject matter similarity, but later it was accepted as a supplementary text to Daśavaikālika niryukti.

Niryuktikāras usually explain only the special technical terms that appear in the text. The eight authorities mentioned at the beginning of Piṇḍaniryukti have no connection with the subject matter of the fifth Piṇḍaiṣaṇā study of Daśavaikālika. On this basis too, it can be said that it must be an independent text.

One important argument for its being an independent text is that the verses of a supplementary text cannot be so many from the original text. The niryuktikāra has written only 371 verses on the entire Daśavaikālika, and only the mention of "Vattavā Piṇḍanijjutti" is found in Daśavaikālika niryukti (218/4), (Hāti 239). There is no indication or explanation of this verse in both the chūrṇīs of Daśavaikālika, therefore, this verse should not originally belong to Daśavaikālika niryukti. The bhāṣyakāra has mentioned "Vattavā Piṇḍanijjutti" to properly understand the dietary practices of the sadhu (see Niryuktipañcaka p. 49).

2. The Daśavaikālikaniryukti edited by Jain Vishva Bharati has 349/2 verses, and the Daśavaikālika Hāribhadriya ṭīkā has 371 verses. In the editing, an attempt has been made to separate the niryukti and the bhāṣya, in which many niryukti verses have been proved to be of the bhāṣya and some bhāṣya verses have been proved to be of the niryukti.

The **Piṇḍaniyukti** has 671 (-324) verses written on the fifth study. How the supplementary text can have more verses than the original text is an investigable point.
• In this context, a question arises that the verses of **Piṇḍaiṣaṇā** study found in **Daśavaikālika** should also be included in **Piṇḍaniyukti**, but those verses are not found in it. If it is assumed that the **niyuktikāra** (author of the commentary) created some verses separately for **Daśavaikālika** and created a separate composition of **Piṇḍaniyukti**, then what is the obstacle in considering it as an independent text?
• In the commentary of **Bṛhatkalpabhāṣya**, in the context of **Piṇḍakalpik**, there is a mention of '**atra Piṇḍaniyuktiḥ sarvā vaktavya**' along with the **Piṇḍaiṣaṇā** study. It is also mentioned that **Piṇḍaniyukti** is a separate text, hence it has its own independent place.
• **Niyuktikāra** often present a concise explanation of the important words that appear in the original text. In **Piṇḍaniyukti**, apart from **Piṇḍa** and **Eṣaṇā**, there is no explanation of any word from **Daśavaikālika**. Secondly, **Piṇḍaniyukti** is as subject-oriented and systematic composition as it is, such systematicness and subject-orientation is not found in the composition style of **niyukti** literature.
• **Oghanīyukti** and **Piṇḍaniyukti** are considered by some Jain sects as part of the 45 **Āgamas**. They are also counted among the original texts. No other **niyukti** has been included in the **Āgamas**. This also makes it clear that **Bhadrabahu** must have created these two independently before other **niyuktis**, or seeing the popularity of **niyukti** literature, he created these two texts independently. From the point of view of subject matter, **Ācārya Mahāprajña** has considered it as a supplement to the **Daśavaikālika** sūtra.
**Separation of **niyukti** and **bhāṣya**: A discussion
In the texts in which commentaries were written on **niyuktis**, except for the **Āvśyaka niyukti**, both the texts often became one text, such as **Bṛhatkalpa**, **Vyavahāra** and **Niśītha** etc. **Ācārya Malayagiri** has mentioned this in the preface of **Bṛhatkalpa bhāṣya**. The same sequence is found in **Piṇḍaniyukti** and **Oghanīyukti**. In its manuscripts, the verses of **niyukti** and **bhāṣya** are written together, from this it can be inferred that by the time of writing of this text, both **niyukti** and **bhāṣya** had become one text.

## Pinḍaniyukti: An Observation

Commentator Malayagiri has mentioned the commentator or the author of the commentary at 18 places. Based on this mention, it can be assumed that the Pinḍaniyukti existed independently for some time even after the commentary was written. However, based on Malayagiri's mention, it cannot be assumed that there are only as many commentary verses as the number of verses mentioned by Acharya Malayagiri as the commentator. This is because it is not necessary for the commentator to mention the commentator at all places.

The number of commentary verses should be more than the number of published commentaries because in the published commentaries, wherever the commentator has mentioned the commentary verse, the verse numbers have been added in front of those verses. However, after a thorough study of the Pinḍaniyukti, it is concluded that it should have 324 verses of the Pinḍaniyukti. Most of the remaining verses are verses from the commentary or verses from other texts that have been added according to the context of the subject.

Although it is extremely difficult to distinguish between two texts written in the same language style, an attempt has been made to separate the verses from the Pinḍaniyukti verses, which is an initial but laborious task. As mentioned at the beginning of the commentary verses, it cannot be claimed that this separation has been done perfectly. However, this first attempt will surely be a guiding light for future researchers. In this context, some lines from a conversation sent by internationally renowned scholar Dalsukh Bhai Malvaniya to Acharya Tulsi on 25.1.85 are worth quoting: "Samani Kusumprajna has done the work of separating the Pinḍaniyukti from the commentary with great effort. This is her first attempt, yet she has made every effort to reach the truth. By going before the scholars, they will be able to critically evaluate it, which will facilitate decision-making and revision in its second edition. It is not possible to separate the Pinḍaniyukti without hard work. I am very impressed by the effort and intelligence she has used in this work. Therefore, I commend and approve this initial effort."

The points on which the attempt has been made to determine the number of verses of the Pinḍaniyukti have been given critical footnotes at almost all places in the text editing. Footnotes have also been given below regarding the verses about which there was a doubtful situation. For the convenience of researchers, some of the major criteria for separation are being presented here. Commentator Malayagiri has been a guide in knowing the projected part, paving the way. He has made a beautiful attempt to connect the subject at the beginning of the verses. Through the commentary, it becomes known how many verses have been explained in which part of which verse. For this, Malayagiri's commentary...

Page #34:
---------------------------
It was necessary to recite the Pindanuyukti one hundred times and to remember where the explanation of the original Dvaragatha ends, just as the explanation of the original Dvaragatha (60) related to Adhakarma extends to 124 verses. Even after many verses, the commentator has given a hint of the explanation of the previous Dvaragatha, therefore it can be said without any doubt that without the commentator, determining the number of verses of the Nuyukti and separating the Bhashyagatha was an extremely difficult task. In addition, the in-depth study, editing and style of composition of other independent Nuyuktis have also been instrumental in determining the number of verses of the Nuyukti. • Many verses of Pindanuyukti have been transferred to Nisith Bhashya etc. There, the commentator has mentioned the commentator for some verses of Pindanuyukti. From the point of view of the order of the subject, they also appear to be Bhashya, therefore, in some places, other explanatory texts have also become the basis of separation. • Writing the main word as a synonym is a linguistic characteristic of the Nuyuktikara. Verses with synonyms related to the subject have been placed in the order of the Nuyuktigaatha, such as verse 51 in Eshana and 61 in Adhakarma. • The language style of the Nuyuktis found independently makes it clear that writing concise verses is the characteristic of the Nuyuktikara. The Nuyuktikara determines the meaning of the word that comes in the original sutra through deposition. Pindanuyukti is an independent text, but even in this, the deposition of the words and main topics that came in the first collection verse has been presented. Although the commentator also writes concise verses, most of the concise verses appear to be of Nuyukti.
After mentioning the original deposition by the author, the explanation of the substance, field, time etc. can be done by both the Nuyuktikara and the commentator, it is clearly written in the Visheshvaavashyak Bhashya that the subject of the Nuyukti is to deposit the name etc., the rest is not to be considered. Therefore, the verses explaining the production of substance and emotion (194/1-3) and the various depositions of the Sadharmic word. (73/1-22) should be of Bhashya.
Wherever the same word has been deposited twice, one of them should clearly be of Bhashya, for example, in the third verse of Pindanuyukti, the Nuyuktikara has mentioned four and six depositions of the word Pind and promised to make its prototype, in 3/1 again there is a hint of six depositions. The Nuyuktikara does not do such repetition, therefore this verse should be of Bhashya because the commentator has clarified it with the example of Kulak.

## Pinḍaniryukti: An Observation

* It cannot be definitively said whether the Dwāragāthā and Sangrahagatha are *nirukti* or not. This is because commentators also write Sangrahagatha or Dwāragāthā to clarify the subject matter. Pandit Dalasukh Bhai Malvaniya has considered Dwāragāthā as *niruktigāthā*.

The linguistic characteristic of the *niyuktikār* is that they mention a story or an example in brief to clarify any subject. Wherever a story is hinted at in brief and later the same story is elaborated, the verse hinting at the story in brief is considered *niruktigat* and the verses elaborating it are considered *bhāṣyagat*. A main reason for considering such verses as *niyuktigat* is that at many places, after the verse hinting at the brief story, the commentator mentions "Atha enam eva gāthām bhāṣyakār: vivṛṇoti". In *Piṇḍaniryukti* itself, in verse 199, there is a hint of the story of Ācārya Sangama and his disciple Datta. Later, for two verses, the commentator has mentioned "Gāthādvayena bhāṣyakṛd vivṛṇoti". This makes it clear that the *bhāṣyakār* elaborates on the *nirukti* verse that hints at the brief story. Such instances are also found in many places in *Āvश्यक* *niyukti* etc. Similarly, in the 76th verse, the *niyuktikār* has hinted at the story in brief. 76/1-5 - these five verses elaborate on the same story again. In addition, verses 90/1-4, 144/1-4, 148/1, 2, 166/1, 2, 179/1, 2 etc. are also noteworthy. The *niyuktikār* has hinted at the four stories of anger, pride, deceit, and greed in the 216th verse. Therefore, 218/1, 219/1-15, 220/1, 2, all these verses should be *bhāṣya*.

* In some places, the *niyuktikār* has not mentioned the story in brief, yet the verses related to the story seem to be *bhāṣya*. The six verses (136/1-6) at the beginning of the *Prāduṣkaraṇa* *dvār* clearly appear to be of the *bhāṣyakār* because the *niruktikār* usually hints at any story in brief. Another reason for this is that the *niyuktikār* usually mentions the story related to the faults of *bhikṣācaryā* after describing their distinctions.

* When the commentator designates the verses elaborating on one story as *nirukti* while referring to multiple stories hinted at in the same verse, then the verses elaborating on the other story should also be *bhāṣya*. For example, if the commentator has mentioned "Bhāṣya gāthā" for the verses explaining the story related to *cūrṇa* and *antaradhāna*, then the 7 verses (231/2-4, 6, 7, 10, 11) related to the story of *pādapralepana*, *yoga*, and *mūlakarma* should also be of the *bhāṣyakār*.

3. *PiBhā* 35-37, *Mavṛp*. 142; *Bhāṣyakṛd gāthātrayeṇa vyākhyānayati*.

**Pinḍaniyukti** • Where the compiler has briefly explained a gate, if there are verses that explain the same gate in detail, they should clearly be commentary verses, such as 41/1, 2, 44/1-4, 52/14, 64/1-3, 83/1-5, 89/1-9, 116/1-4 etc. • Conversational or repetitive verses cannot be the work of the same author. The commentator of that text must make the verse or foot of the original verse a part of his verse in his commentary. Wherever a verse has been repeated or the same topic has been expanded again after a brief statement, those verses have not been added to the original number of the appointment, they should be commentary verses. For example, verses 82/1-3, in these, the fourth verse of the 82nd verse and the first verse of 82/3 are almost the same in terms of words and in terms of subject, the 82nd verse is directly connected to the 83rd verse. In the same order, verses 313/1-6, 314/1-3, 318/1, 2, 320/1, 2 etc. should also be of the commentary. • The uniformity of language style has also been helpful in separating the commentary from the appointment. The compiler has explained almost all the faults related to begging by describing its nature or by distinguishing it, but in the case of the fault of attachment, there is a dialogue between the guru and the disciple in the initial 10 verses, these ten verses seem to be explanatory 295/1-10. • The order and precedence of the subject has also been helpful in separating the projected parts. At many places, from the point of view of the order of the subject, it was clear that this much part has been projected later by the commentator or other acharya in an unauthorized manner, it has no connection with the original subject or verse. Even without adding those verses to the original number, there is no difference in the order of the current subject matter. For example, in the last verse of the 166th verse, the compiler mentions that these are the faults of Malāpahṛta. In between 166/1, 2 - these two verses have an expansion of the story. In 167, the faults of Malāpahṛta are mentioned, therefore, from the point of view of the subject, the 166th verse is connected to the 167th verse. The two verses in between clearly appear to be of the commentary. Similarly, from the point of view of the subject, the 68th verse is connected to the 69th verse. In the 11 verses in between, the commentator has explained the karma of the self by the analogy of Kūṭapāśa. The 70th verse is related to the 71st verse from the point of view of the subject. In between 70/1-6 - these six verses should be the projected or commentary explanation of the fourfold of pronunciation and meaning and its comparison with Ādhākarma. • Wherever the same verse has been repeated, the verse has been added to the number of the original appointment verse, where the order seemed appropriate from the point of view of the subject. In another place, that same verse has been kept in order but not added to the number of the original appointment verse.

## Pinḍaniyukti: An Observation

**23.** In some places, the separation of the niyukti and bhāṣya has been done based on the interpretation of other dvāras. For example, the niyuktikāra has given a very brief explanation of the dvāras related to the pṛthvīkāya piṇḍa and agnikāya piṇḍa. Therefore, the following gāthās related to the apkāya should be considered bhāṣya: 17/1-3, 21/1,2, 22/1-6, and 27/1, 2. Similarly, the 198/1-15 gāthās of the dhātrīpiṇḍa and the 207/1-4 gāthās of the ājīva piṇḍa should also be considered bhāṣya because the explanation of the dūtī and nimitta dvāras, etc., is very brief.

**•** In some places, even if the gāthā is not explained in the ṭīkā, if it is found in the manuscripts of the piṇḍaniyukti, then the gāthā related to the subject has been added to the niyukti's serial number. The gāthās that seemed irrelevant or interpolated have not been added to the original serial number even if they are placed in the sequence of gāthās, such as 173/1. If the gāthā is found in even one or two manuscripts, then it has been placed in the sequence of gāthās. If it appears to be explanatory, then it has not been added to the original serial number, such as the 231/5 gāthā, which is found only in the A and B manuscripts. Similarly, if the gāthā is not found in the manuscripts but is present in the ṭīkā or avacūrī, then it has been added to the original serial number if it appears to be niyukti; otherwise, it has been placed in the sequence without being added to the serial number, such as the 192/6, 7, 253/3 gāthās.

**•** In some places, it is clear that so many gāthās should be considered bhāṣya or interpolated in between. For example, in the context of grahaṇaiṣaṇā, the niyuktikāra mentions in gāthā 236: "bhāvammai ya dasapada hoti." Three additional gāthās seem to be extra, which elaborate on the story related to the vānarayūtha. The gāthā related to the dasapada is the 237th. From the point of view of the subject, the 236th gāthā is also connected to the 237th.

**•** One way to identify the bhāṣya-gāthā is that where the bhāṣyakāra is explaining all the dvāras, the gāthā explaining only one dvāra has not been added to the niyukti's sequence.

**•** The gāthās that we have not considered niyuktigat have been placed in the sequence of niyukti but have not been added to the original serial number of the niyukti, such as 3/1, 44/1-4, etc.

In some places, it was very difficult to decide about the gāthās. There, we have decided on the gāthās based on our own thinking. These points of separation have also helped in separating other niyuktis from the bhāṣya.

**The Subject Matter and Uniqueness of Piṇḍaniyukti**

Piṇḍaniyukti is an important text related to the caraṇakaraṇānuyoga. This text encompasses many topics related to the sadhu's bhikṣācāryā. While the Nandī Sūtra mentions the kālika and utkālika sūtras, it does not mention both piṇḍaniyukti and oghanīyukti. It seems that...

## Pinḍa Niyukti

Being a text on conduct, it later became established as a मूलसूत्र (fundamental text). Due to its description of पिण्ड (body), it is sometimes counted among the छेदसूत्र (texts dealing with specific topics).

The author of the text, in the beginning, has divided the faults related to begging into eight categories through संग्रह गाथा (collected verses). Even though many other topics are discussed later, the author has described these eight categories in order. The name of the text is पिण्डनिर्युक्ति, therefore, the author has explained the word पिण्ड in detail at the beginning. In the explanation of the nine types of पिण्ड, a beautiful description is given of how a पिण्ड, from one-sense to five-sense, is useful for humans. This entire description is very useful from the perspective of Ayurveda and medicine. In ancient times, before washing their clothes, monks would practice विश्रमणा-विधि (a method of rest) for seven days or three days. Although this practice is no longer followed, it still signifies the importance of subtle non-violence in the conduct of monks at that time.

There are many types of भावपिण्ड (mental body) that present various options for spirituality. After the detailed explanation of the word पिण्ड, the author has given a concise explanation of the words एषणा (desire) and उद्गम (origin). Then, the author has discussed the sixteen faults of उद्गम, including आधाकर्म (half-action), in detail. Among the sixteen faults of उद्गम, आधाकर्म is considered more serious, therefore, it has been discussed comprehensively through various categories. After that, the author has indicated which fault belongs to which category, विशोधिकोटि (purifying category) or अविशोधिकोटि (non-purifying category).

After उद्गम, the author discusses the concise explanation of उत्पादना (production) and its sixteen faults, including धात्री (wet nurse). Along with the explanation of the faults, the author has also presented a picture of the culture and civilization of that time, such as what effect a particular धात्री has on a child and what types of धाय (wet nurses) existed at that time and what their roles were. After the explanation of the sixteen faults of उत्पादना, the author discusses the ten faults of एषणा, including शंकित (doubtful).

Finally, the author gives a detailed description of the five faults of ग्रासैषणा (desire for food), including संयोजना (combination). Even after consuming pure food free from the faults of उद्गम and उत्पादना, a monk can still create karmic bondage during the time of consumption. The description of the प्रमाण-दोष (fault of quantity) in ग्रासैषणा is important from the perspective of Ayurveda, and the description of the quantity of food according to the season is also scientifically explained. The criteria of हिताहार (beneficial food) and मिताहार (moderate food) are noteworthy from the perspective of health science.

The author has often used stories to explain the faults related to begging.

## Pinḍaniryukti: An Observation

25

This is explained by the commentators and annotators. Except for a few narratives mentioned in Pinḍaniryukti, the narratives are mostly new, which are rarely found in other explanatory literature. The narrative uniqueness of Pinḍaniryukti will be discussed further.

The author has also discussed philosophical and theoretical issues in context. The explanation of the word "Pinḍa" includes the explanation of Kṣetrapinḍa and Kālapinḍa from a philosophical perspective. There is a combination and division of Pinḍa related to name, establishment, substance, etc., therefore, these are Pinḍa in a transcendental sense, but there is no such combination and division in Kṣetra and Kālapinḍa, therefore, Kṣetrapinḍa and Kālapinḍa are accepted formally. This is a tri-regional Samvagāḍha Triprādeśika Pudgala Skandha in three regions, or food prepared in a particular kitchen, this type of Vyapadesa is Kṣetrapinḍa. Similarly, this is a Trisāmayika Pudgala Skandha or Chatursāmayika, such a statement is Kālapinḍa.

In this context, the author himself has raised a question that mutual investigation and numerical abundance are possible in concrete substances, but investigation-union of Kṣetra and Kāla is not possible, Kṣetra is artificial, its regions are located separately, therefore, the union of Ākāśa-regions is not possible. In Kāla also, the past time has been destroyed, the future has not been born, only one time is present in the present, therefore, mutual investigation and numerical abundance are impossible in Kāla. Answering this, the author says that all the regions of Ākāśa remain connected in a continuous manner, just like the four Skandhas produced by the clouds. There is also numerical abundance in the regions of Kṣetra, therefore, the word Pinḍa can be used for Kṣetra. Kāla is present-momentary. Its past and future times do not meet, but numerical abundance is possible in Kāla conceived by the intellect, therefore, Pinḍa of Kāla is also possible. Due to being resultant and consequent, intellectual investigation is possible with the present time. According to the commentator, there is a detailed description of this in the Dharma Sangrahaṇī Tīkā, therefore, it is not explained here.

The author has also described linguistics through deposition here and there. In the context of the word Pinḍa, four types of names are mentioned in Nāma Nikṣepa. Despite being given in a note, it is being described in detail here due to its importance.

1. **Gauṇanāma:** To name someone according to their qualities, actions, and substances, for example, to name a powerful person Mahāvīra, the name of a cow is not based on Gotva, but on the basis of the action of movement.
2. **Dravyanāma:** It is based on etymology, for example, Śṛngī, Danṭī, Daṇḍī, etc.

**Pindaniyukti** is a name famous in theory but meaningless in terms of time. In practice, a group of liquids is not called a **pind**, but the term **pind** has been used for water in the scriptures. Therefore, even in the absence of the synthesis of hard matter, the name **pind** for water is famous in time but not meaningful. The name **Prabhriti** for **odana** is also a name of time.

**Tadu-bhayaj** - names that are both meaningful and famous in time, such as the name **Rajoharan** for **Dharmadhwaj**. It is called **Rajoharan** because it removes both external and internal **raj**. Therefore, its name is **Rajoharan** by treating the action in the cause.

**Anubhayaj** - meaningless and unknown in theory. The commentator has mentioned the name **Ubayatirikta** for this, such as giving someone the name **Singh** in the absence of **shaurya** etc.

The commentator has raised a question that there is no special difference between **Samayakrit** and **Ubayatirikta** because both names are deficient in meaning. Therefore, instead of mentioning two, only one could be mentioned. In response, the commentator says that common people use the names that are symbolic in the world, but common people do not use the names that are famous in theory, such as the use of the word **Samuddesha** for food. Therefore, both have been mentioned separately. Similarly, both **Goun** and **Samayakrit** are meaningful names, but common people use the **Goun** name and not the **Samayakrit** name, but only the **Samayakrit** name is used by the people of the time.

Many psychological facts have also been presented in **Pindaniyukti** in context, such as:

* A child who is not rejected in childhood becomes intelligent and disease-free in the future. This means that if any frustration is instilled in the subconscious mind in childhood, it greatly affects the person in adulthood.
* The **niyuktikar** has carved the effect of the **dhai's** body on the child's body and mind based on the thinness and thickness of the **dhai's** body in a very psychological way. This entire context is very important from the perspective of modern child psychology.
* If people laugh at each other when they hear someone's statement, then it should be understood that there is less truth in what is being said. The author has explained this psychological method to know whether **bhiksha** is **auddeshik** or not. If the **grihaswamini** says that this food is made for us

27
If, upon hearing that a monk has gone, other members of the family laugh amongst themselves, the monk should understand that the alms are not genuine.

In short, it can be said that the entire text presents a comprehensive discussion of the monk's begging practice. Previously, scattered references to faults related to alms are found in the Bhagavati, Acharachula, and other Agamas, but in terms of such a systematic and organized description, Pinḍaniryukti can be called the most ancient text. 1

**Language Style**

Niryukti is a verse-based commentary written in the Prakrit language, reflecting the influence of both Ardhamagadhi and Maharashtri languages. The subject matter of Niryukti is presented using the method of "nikshepa" (deposition). The Niryuktikara has presented a detailed explanation using the method of deposition of selected and technical terms, such as pinḍa, udgama, utpadana, eshana, etc. Through this, he has presented a comprehensive knowledge of the subject. Pinḍa

In the context of nikshepa, the Niryuktikara clearly states that here the context is of the "achitta dravyapinda" (non-mental material object) and the "prashasta bhavpinda" (excellent mental object), but to make the disciple's mind understand, a detailed discussion of pinḍas like name, etc., has been done. 2

Writing synonyms for important words is a linguistic characteristic of the Niryuktikara. The use of synonyms has also been presented in the text, such as pinḍa, adhakarma, etc., see Pari. San. 6. In some places, the author has also explained the tradition of the difference in meaning of synonymous words through examples, which is very important from the point of view of linguistics. In gatha 52/1, eshana, gaveshana, margana, and udgopana - although synonymous, the difference in meaning of all four words should be known, see the translation of 52/1.

Like other niryuktis, Pinḍaniryukti also uses many native words, see Pari. San. 8. The linguistic importance of the present text is the use of poignant and impactful sayings. Although primarily focused on conduct, this text uses some important sayings, see Pari. San. 9.

The use of similes, worldly examples, illustrations, and logic creates diversity, penetration, and elegance in the language. The Niryuktikara has explained complex theoretical topics through new similes and examples, see Pari. San. 10 and 12.

##  Chapter 28:  The Style of the Author

The author, in some places, has used multiple actions together to reveal the characteristics of the action or the doer. For example:

> "They praise and they give, they cut and they grind, they cage and they tear, they kill and they beat."

In the above single verse, the author has used eight verbs, each expressing different actions.

While the use of nominal verbs is less common in Prakrit, the author has used them as needed. For example, "Vatuंti" means "to make round," and here it refers to shaping a round sweet. Similarly, the use of nominal verbs like "Mamaye" etc. is also noteworthy.

The author has also presented discussions related to grammar in many places. For example:

> "Vani Jayan tti Vaniyo."

In many places, the concise meaning of words or the distinction between two words has also been clarified. For example, in verse 79, the distinction between "Nishthit" and "Krit" is explained.

The author has adopted both the styles of "Vyas" and "Samas." In many places, a detailed explanation of a single topic or word is given, while in other places, the topic is presented very concisely. The following example illustrates the concise style:

> "Kattoccau tti Sali Vani Janati Puccha Tam Gantum." (Pini 88/1)

This single sentence mentions three things.

It is a stylistic characteristic of the author that, to comprehensively discuss the desired topic, they first provide a brief overview of all the topics in a verse, which is called "Dwaragatha," and then explain each "Dwar" one by one. In verse 60, there are nine "Dwars" related to "Adhakarma," and then each "Dwar" is elaborated upon in 124 verses.

The author has presented the cause-and-effect chain in many places. For example, "Darshan" and "Jnana" give rise to "Charitra," and the purity of these two leads to the purity of "Charitra," which in turn leads to the purity of "Karma," and the purity of "Udgam" leads to the purity of "Charitra."

From the perspective of meter, the author has sometimes shortened words and made the quantity of syllables short. For example, "Jivan" - "Jiyan," "Veyana" - "Viyana," etc.

## Pinḍaniyukti: An Observation

The author of the Pinḍaniyukti has often explained the reasons behind the topics discussed. For example, he has given reasons why clothes should be washed before the rainy season, and also discussed the harms caused by washing them during the rainy season. (See the translation of Pinḍi Gā. 20 and 21). He has mentioned the reasons for eating, and also explained the reasons for not eating.

After studying the Pinḍaniyukti literature, it can be clearly said that the author's main goal was to present the subject matter, not to create any poetry. Therefore, he paid less attention to the meters and focused more on presenting the facts.

The use of stories is a stylistic feature of the author. He often used narratives to explain the subject matter. Some of these stories are related to kings, queens, ministers, or merchants, while others show the influence of the Panchatantra. It seems that, except for some historical and fictional stories related to animals and birds, the author has presented the narratives or illustrations based on events that occurred in his time.

In the Pinḍaniyukti, apart from historical stories, the names of places or individuals are rarely mentioned in the stories. However, the commentator has often mentioned the names of villages, cities, or districts, and the names of the related individuals in the stories. It seems likely that the commentator has mentioned the names of the locations and individuals in a fictional way to give the event the form of a story, such as the names of the four sons and four daughters-in-law of Sagaradatta Shreshthi in the Govatsa illustration. However, further discussion is needed on this topic.

Except for some historical stories like Chanakya, Arya Samiti, or Padalipta, most of the narratives are not found in the Āgama-vyākhyā-sāhitya. Some of these narratives are found in the Nishīth Bhāṣya and Jītakalpa Bhāṣya. This is because these chapters have been transferred from the Pinḍaniyukti.

The understanding of animals and birds in the stories mentioned in the Pinḍaniyukti is presented in a highly developed form. The deer leader tells the deer that this is not the season for the Śrīparṇī fruits to ripen. Even if they ripen, there are not so many fruits in the summer season. Therefore, this is a trick by some cunning person. The monkey leader also explains to the monkeys that this Draha is not harmless because there are footprints of carnivores going into the Draha, but there are no footprints coming out. In the context of the Grāsaiṣaṇā fault, the fish itself tells a courageous story from its own mouth. Here, the author has used the concept of shadowism beautifully.

The text of the *Piṇḍaniyukti* also presents theoretical topics beautifully through stories. In the *Nūpurapaṇḍitā* narrative, the four types of transgression (atikram, etc.) are beautifully explained through the medium of an elephant. The *Piṇḍaniyukti* commentary literature is written in a very concise and symbolic style, making it extremely difficult to understand without commentary literature. For example, in the context of *Ādhākarma*, the author of the *Piṇḍaniyukti* has mentioned "Dansaṇagandhaparikahā, Bhāvinti Sulūhavittin Pi2". Even though it is simple, it is difficult to understand the latter part of the verse without a commentary or explanation.

**Original Commentary and Old Commentary**

Ācārya Malayagiri has mentioned the old commentary or the old tradition in many places. This mention could mean that there was a previous Ācārya's text that presented an explanation of the *Piṇḍaniyukti* before him. The term "Old Commentary" has also been mentioned by Yaśodevasūri, the commentator of the *Piṇḍaviśuddhiprakaraṇa*. This original commentary is not available today, but it is a subject of historical research to find out which Ācārya Ācārya Malayagiri has referred to as the original commentator and when he wrote this commentary.

The commentator has mentioned the old tradition, old commentary, previous Ācārya commentary, and original commentary in the following places:

* "Pravacanādipadasaṭake Punarevaṃ Pūrvācāryavyākhyā Pravacanalin̄ga..." (Mavṛ p. 55)
* "Uktan Ca Mūlatīkāyāṃ Caraṇātmavighāte...Heto'nirarthakatvādīti." (Mavṛ p. 42, 43)
* "Tadayuktaṃ, Mūlatīkāyāṃ Asyārthasyāsammaṭatvāṭ, Mūlatīkāyāṃ Hi Liṅgābhigraha...Vidhirevamuktaṃ, Liṅge No Abhigghe..." (Mavṛ p. 62)
* "Atra Vṛddhasamprāyaḥ, Iha Yadyekam Vāraṃ...Niṣṭhitakṛta Ucyate." (Mavṛ p. 65, 66)
* "Atra Cāyaṃ Vṛddhasamprāyaḥ-Saṅkalpitāsu Dattiṣu...Kalpyamavaseyam." (Mavṛ p. 78)
* "Yata Uktan Mūlatīkāyāṃ-'Atra Cāyaṃ Vidhiḥ-Sandissantaṃ Jo Suṇai...Doṣābhāvādīti.'" (Mavṛ p. 81)

Vīrācārya has mentioned in the initial praise verses of his concise commentary that Ācārya Haribhadra wrote a commentary called "Śiṣyahiṭā" on the *Piṇḍaniyukti*, but he wrote this commentary only up to the *sthāpanā doṣa* and then passed away. Ācārya Malayagiri's commentary mentions the old commentary, old tradition, or previous Ācārya commentary before the *sthāpanā doṣa*. The discussion of the subsequent faults...

## Pinḍaniyukti: An Observation

**Commentary:**

Mālayagiri does not mention this in his commentary, so it is possible that the "vṛddha-vyākhyā," "mūlatīkā," or "vṛddha-sampradāya" mentioned by Mālayagiri refers to the *Śiṣya-hitā* commentary by Haribhadra. However, further research is needed on this topic.

**Pinḍaniyukti Bhāṣya:**

The first brief commentary on *Pinḍaniyukti* is the *Bhāṣya*. The published commentary contains only 37 *bhāṣya* verses, but originally there must have been more. This is indicated in the notes in the edition.

Since a *bhāṣya* was written on *niyukti*, it is certain that there were two ācāryas who authored these works. Ācārya Mālayagiri mentions "āha bhāṣyakāraḥ" etc. in many places and also explains the *bhāṣya* verses, so it is also certain that the *bhāṣyakāra* lived before Ācārya Mālayagiri.

It is not possible to say for certain who the *bhāṣyakāra* of *Pinḍaniyukti* was. Currently, two names are known as *bhāṣyakāra* - Saṅhadāsagaṇi and Jinabhadragaṇi Kṣamāśramaṇa.

In the *Nīśītha Bhāṣya*, after the verse of *Pinḍaniyukti*, the *cūrṇikāra* mentions "etīa imā do vakkhāṇagāhāo" for the verses explaining it. This mention is found in other places as well. This suggests that the *Nīśītha Bhāṣyakāra* may have composed the *bhāṣya* verses, but further research and discussion are needed in this regard.

Looking at the *Laghubhāṣya*, it is also possible that some ācārya in between composed this *bhāṣya*.

**Mālayagīrīya Tīkā:**

Currently, the most comprehensive commentary on *Pinḍaniyukti* is by Ācārya Mālayagiri. Although there is no specific information about his life in history, he was a contemporary of Hemacandra, so his existence is confirmed around the 12th century. Ācārya Mālayagiri wrote extensive commentaries on about 25 texts.

The commentator's wide knowledge can be seen from the fact that he also mentions other texts, such as "etaccañyatra dharma-saṅgrahaṇīṭikādau vibhāvitamiti neha bhūyo vibhāvyate, granthagaurava-bhayāt." He also mentions other beliefs by mentioning "anye" or "kecidāhuḥ" in many places, such as:

1. *Mavṛ* p. 23.

Others apply the term *tadguna-vikatthana* to *pindaniyukti* in this way: "Someone who eats *adhakarman*..." (Mavri p. 50). Some say: "Those who have attained the *ekadashi* image are *sadhukalpa*, and even their..." (Mavri p. 62).

The commentator, by mentioning Panini's sutras in passing, has also explained grammar and the derivation of words. For example, the word *malin* is neuter, but due to Prakrit, it is used as masculine. The commentator says: "Even though *malinani* is neuter, the sutra indicates masculinity due to the characteristics of Prakrit, and it is said: 'Panini, in his own description of Prakrit, says: 'The gender can be violated.'"

Similarly, while explaining the word *niyoga*, the commentator says: "One who is not preceded by anything is used in the sense of 'benefit'... 'He is used, he is employed by this' - *niyoga* is the instrument."

The commentator has also discussed *tattvajñana* in passing, for example, he has discussed *shatsthana-patita*, *samyama-shreni*, and *kandaka* in detail in these two chapters, 39 and 40.

In some places, he has also described the sublime spiritual essence in the form of self-reflection. In such places, his language, even though literary, is very important. When *laddhukapriya-kumara* attained *kaivalya*, the commentator presented his self-reflection in a literary style.

The story hinted at by the *niyuktikara* has been elaborated by Acharya Malayagiri. It is very difficult to understand those stories without the help of the commentary. Through the stories, the commentator has also preserved many cultural facts.

It can be said that the commentary plays a very important role in understanding the heart of *pindaniyukti*. In many places, it is not impossible, but certainly difficult, to grasp the heart of the verses without the help of the commentary. *Pindaniyukti Avchuri*

There is also an *avchuri* on *pindaniyukti* by Kshamaratnasuri. The *avchurikara* has explained *pindaniyukti* in brief. In some places, where Acharya Malayagiri has not explained the context, Acharya Kshamaratnasuri has explained it in the *avchuri*. In some places, the *avchurikara* has quoted the Malayagiri commentary, mentioning "the old tradition in the *vrutta*," for example, see Av p. 102. *Viracharya's Commentary*

There is also a short commentary on *pindaniyukti* by Viracharya. At the beginning of the commentary, he has mentioned...

**Pinḍaniyukti:** It has been observed that Haribhadra Suri started writing a commentary called Śiṣyahitā on Pinḍaniyukti, but he passed away after writing the commentary up to the section on establishment defects. 
This commentary is concise but presents an explanation of the original words. It is published in the ninth appendix along with the Avacūrī, published by Devacandra Lalbhai Jain Pustakoddhār. 
**Maṇikyasekhara's Dīpikā**
A concise commentary on Pinḍaniyukti is also found in Ācārya Maṇikyasekhara's Dīpikā. It contains an explanation of the first approximately 100 verses. The explanation of hundreds of verses in the middle is missing. Again, the Dīpikā author has started the explanation from the Dāyaka doṣa. This Dīpikā is published in the tenth appendix along with the Pinḍaniyukti Avacūrī. 
**Influence of Earlier Texts on Pinḍaniyukti**
Just as the Tīrthankaras were devoted to spirituality, they were also devoted to conduct. This is why, on the one hand, we have a gem of a text like Ācārāṅga, which presents the most excellent exposition of spirituality, and on the other hand, the second Śrutaśkaṇḍha, Ācāra-cūlā, which presents a detailed exposition of good conduct.
Hints of the conduct of a sādhus and their defects are found scattered in the Āṅga literature such as Ācāra-cūlā, Sūtrakṛtāṅga,  Śthānāṅga, Bhagavati, and Praśnavyākaraṇa. In narrative Āṅga literature like Vipākaśruta, there is no special discussion regarding the conduct of begging. Within the Chedasūtras, in Niśītha, there are provisions for many rules, sub-rules, and penances related to begging. In the Mūlasūtras, the first and fifth studies of Daśavaikalika are related to begging. In Uttarādhyayana, there are instructions regarding the defects of begging in the style of a sermon, as the occasion arises.
It can be said that almost all the defects of begging are mentioned in the Āgamas in a scattered form. (See Introduction, p. 89) The author of the Niyukti, like a garland maker, has strung them together in a coherent way, giving them the form of a garland. Therefore, it can be said without a doubt that even though it is influenced by Āgama literature, the systematic and organized description of the 42 or 46 defects of begging is the original contribution of the author of the Niyukti. 
**Influence of Pinḍaniyukti on Other Later Texts**
It has been a characteristic of ancient literature that authors would incorporate any part of any text into their own text without any mention of the source. At that time, this was not considered literary theft.
1. Muni Hansasāgara has translated the verses of Pinḍaniyukti and the commentary of Malayagiri into Gujarati. This book is published by Hansasāgara Śāsana-kaṇṭakoddhār Jñānamantra, Bhavnagar.

##  Pindaniyukti

It is difficult to determine today which text influenced which, and which text contains the earliest mention of a particular topic, given the presence of similar sections in numerous texts. Many stories related to Pindaniyukti have been incorporated into other texts as chapters or as explanations of topics. Here are some points regarding the influence of Pindaniyukti on later literature.

The detailed explanation of the word "Pind" in Pindaniyukti is relevant, but the forty verses related to "Pind" in Oghanuyukti seem to be quoted from Pindaniyukti, as there is no context for the explanation of "Pind" there.

The faults of Udgama and Utpadana have been transmitted from the Svetambara tradition to the Digambara tradition. Pandit Sukhlalji considers Mulachar to be a compiled work, so it is very likely that the chapter on Bhikṣācaryā in Mulachar was influenced by Pindaniyukti. Although there are differences in the names and order of the faults in many places, and the verses are not the same, it can be said that this chapter is influenced by Pindaniyukti in terms of subject matter and names. While Pindaniyukti mentions Aṣṭavidha Pindaniyukti, Mulachar hints at Aṣṭavidha Pindasuddhi. Considering the chapter, it does not seem possible that the author of Pindaniyukti was influenced by Mulachar.

Based on the current Digambara and Svetambara methods of Bhikṣā, it can also be said that the faults of Bhikṣācaryā related to Udgama, Utpadana, and Eṣaṇā were determined by the Svetambara Ācāryas. The Digambara Ācāryas wrote more on Prathamānuyoga and Karmavāda, so detailed descriptions of practical Ācāra-Mīmāṁsā are found less frequently in texts other than Mulachar and Bhagavati Ārādhanā.

The Niśīthabhāṣya describes 152 faults related to Utpadana in approximately 972 verses. Almost all the verses are identical to those in Pindaniyukti. Some verses have been added by the Bhāṣyakāra. For example, for verse Pin 205 (Nibha 4406), the Niśīth Chūrṇikāra mentions "Imā Bhaddabāhukayā Gāhā", and for the two verses following it, he mentions "Etiyā Imā Do Vakkhaṇagāhāo". This indicates that the Niśīth Bhāṣyakāra has made these verses a part of his commentary. The Chūrṇikāra has mentioned Pindaniyukti in many places, some references are presented here:

* Jahā Govo Pindanijjuttiye (Niču Bhā. 4 p. 67).
1. Oni 331-71.
2. Niśīth does not mention Mulakarma.
3. Nibha 4375-4472.
4. Niču Bhā. 3 p. 411.
5. Pibha 33, 34, Nibha 4407, 4408, Chū. p. 411.

Page #49:
---------------------------
**Piṇḍaniyukti: An Observation**

* According to the *Seṣa Piṇḍanijjutti*, it should be explained (Ni. Bhā. 4, p. 191). * It should be explained in detail as in the *Piṇḍanijjutti Gāhā Sutta* (Ni. Bhā. 4, p. 193).

The *Jītakalpa Bhāṣya* describes the faults of *bhikṣācārya* in 5861 verses. The commentator has also created new verses for atonement or to establish a connection in some places. In some places, he has also abridged the expansion, for example, the explanation of *sādharmika* is expanded in 22 verses in *Piṇḍaniyukti*, but Jinabhadragaṇi Kṣamāśramaṇa has described it briefly. Looking at the verses of the *Jītakalpa Bhāṣya*, it can be assumed that the commentator has made this entire passage a part of his work with some changes.

*Piṇḍaviśuddhi Prakaraṇa* is a short treatise written on the *bhikṣācārya* of a *sādhu* and its faults. Its author, Jinavallabha Sūri, a disciple of Abhaydeva Sūri, the commentator of the *Navāṅgī Ṭīkā*, composed this treatise based on *Piṇḍaniyukti*. At the end of the treatise, in the 103rd verse in the *śārdulavikrīḍita* meter, he himself mentions:

> *Iccheyam Jiṇavallaheṇa Gaṇiṇā, jaṁ Piṇḍanijjuttiō. Kiñcī Piṇḍavihāṇajāṇanakae, bhavvāṇa savvāṇa vi. Vuttaṁ Suttanīuttamuḍḍhamaīṇā, bhattiī sattiī taṁ. Savvaṁ bhavvam maccharā suyaharā, bohintu sohintu ya.*

The author has given a concise but meaningful presentation about *bhikṣācārya*, but has also used his original brilliance in some places, such as the doors of *ādhākarma* and their explanation. This treatise has the special feature that the author has presented a brief definition of every fault. The importance of the treatise can be known from the fact that six commentaries and one *avacūrī* have been written on it.

The commentator Yaśodeva Sūri has expanded almost all the stories mentioned in *Piṇḍaniyukti*. He has mostly presented the stories in the Prakrit language. Some stories are also in Prakrit verse. It seems likely that these stories, written in detail in Prakrit verse, were quoted by the commentator from some other treatise.

Extra-canonical literature, which discusses *bhikṣācārya* and its faults, is mostly post-*Piṇḍaniyukti* literature. Looking at them, it can be easily assumed that almost all the later treatises related to *bhikṣācārya* are influenced by *Piṇḍaniyukti*. Among these, the *Aṣṭaka Prakaraṇa* (fifth, sixth, seventh *aṣṭaka*) by Ācārya Haribhadra, the *Pañcāśaka Prakaraṇa* (thirteenth *pañcāśaka*), the *Pañca Vastu* (verses 739-68), the *Viṁśati Viṁśikā* (thirteenth and fourteenth *viṁśikā*), the *Pravacana Sāroddhāra* and its commentary by Ācārya Nemicandra, the *Mūlācāra* and the *Anāgāra Dharmāmṛta* etc. are prominent.

##  **Pinḍaniyukti**

**The Consciousness of Stationary Bodies: A Discourse**

In the Vedic tradition, Earth, Water, Fire, etc. are revered as deities. In the Nāstika and some other schools of thought, they are accepted as the five elements.  Mahavira, through his direct knowledge, declared them to be living beings, stating, "Earth, Fire, etc. are themselves living beings. Many Trasa and stationary beings reside in them. Stationary beings are conscious without the need for weapons. One who harms stationary beings also harms many subtle Bādar, as well as sufficient and insufficient beings residing in them." 

Witnessing the scientific exposition of the six categories of living beings (ṣaḍjīvanikāya), Ācārya Siddhasena exclaimed, "O Lord! Your omniscience is evident in your exposition of the six categories of living beings. The presentation of the ṣaḍjīvanikāya is a unique contribution of Mahavira to the entire Indian philosophy." In the Ācārāṅga Niyukti, the Niyuktikāra has presented many logical and practical arguments for the consciousness of stationary bodies. A detailed description of this is provided in the introduction to the Niyuktipañcaka.

In Pinḍaniyukti, the author, in the context of explaining the word "Pinḍa," presents a novel perspective on the conscious, unconscious, and mixed states of Earth and other stationary bodies. The consciousness of stationary bodies is dense, and they are always influenced by a state of partial sleep (styānārddhi nidrā). Therefore, it is extremely difficult to determine their conscious, unconscious, or mixed state based on external signs. Only a specific knowledgeable person can describe this. The departure of the soul from a conscious object occurs according to a fixed time or due to the use of opposing weapons. The Niyuktikāra has meticulously presented the conscious, unconscious, and other states of stationary bodies from both the perspective of certainty and practice. Here, some specific references presented by him are being presented:

**Earth Body**

The Earth bodies of hell like Ratnaśarkara, etc., and the central parts of great mountains like Meru, Himalayas, etc., are undoubtedly conscious. Unhindered forests, where there is no movement of humans and animals, and no dung, etc., are practically conscious. Trees like Banyan and Asvattha are called Kṣīradruma. Due to their sweetness, there is a lack of weapons there. Under these trees, some Earth becomes unconscious due to cold, etc., which are weapons, while some remain conscious. The Earth outside a village or city is also mixed.

## Pinḍaniryukti: An Observation

Because land that has been uprooted by the wheels of carts and wagons, or broken by a plow, is initially sentient (saccitt), but then becomes somewhat insentient (acitt) due to cold winds and other factors, it becomes mixed. When rainwater falls on sentient earth, initially some of the earth particles become insentient, while some remain sentient. After a short time, both become insentient due to being weapons (śastra) to each other.

If there is heavy rainfall, the earth particles remain in a mixed state until the rain stops. When the rain stops, sometimes the earth remains sentient. Dung and other fuels are weapons to sentient earth particles. As long as the earth is not fully transformed, it remains sentient. If there is more fuel (dung, etc.) and less earth, the earth remains in a mixed state for one prahara. With moderate fuel, it remains sentient for two praharas, and with little fuel, it remains sentient for three praharas. The commentator of Oghaniryukti explains this using the example of clay mixed with water brought by a potter.

If salt, etc., is transported from its place of origin to a distance of one hundred yojanas, it becomes insentient. Some Acharyas consider one hundred gavyutis instead of one hundred yojanas. Explaining the reason for its becoming insentient, the commentator says that it does not get its appropriate nourishment. It becomes insentient when transferred from one vessel to another, or when placed from one cart to another. It also becomes insentient due to wind, fire, and smoke.

The commentator gives another reason for salt, etc., becoming insentient, saying that it becomes insentient when people sit on bags of salt loaded on the back of a cart, or due to the heat of the body of oxen, etc. It also gradually becomes insentient when the nourishment it receives from the earth is cut off.

Similarly, harital, manahsila, etc., which are earth particles, also become insentient when transported beyond one hundred yojanas. The reasons for their becoming insentient should be understood in the same way as for salt.

Cold weapons, hot weapons (intense heat of the sun, etc.), alkali, special dung, fire, salt, salt produced in arid regions, etc., along with dust, acidity, oil, etc., are all weapons to earth particles. These make the earth particles insentient. The commentator of Pinḍaniryukti, Viracharya, has also discussed in detail the becoming insentient of earth particles in relation to substance (dravya), region (kṣetra), time (kāla), and emotion (bhāva).

##  38. Apkay (Water)

Many philosophers have acknowledged the existence of living beings in water, but Mahavira, making a new proposition, stated that water itself is a living being. The solid, dense, foundational earth of hell (ghanodadhi) and the circular, water-filled ghanavalaya surrounding the hellish earth, the oceans containing hail, salt, etc., and the water in the middle of the Padmadrah, etc., are definitely sentient (saccitt). The water in wells, tanks, and ponds, etc., is sentient according to practical usage (vyavaharanaya). Sometimes, the entire water of a pond may be non-sentient (acitt), but in the absence of omniscience (sarvjna), it is practically impossible to know whether it is sentient or non-sentient. Therefore, while traveling from Rajagriha to Vitabhaya Nagar in the Sindhusauvira country to ordain King Udayan, even though the pond was considered non-sentient, Lord Mahavira did not allow him to drink its water. Pure water (antarakshajal), dew, haratanuk (water droplets that emerge from the earth), mahika (mist), and snow are all sentient apkay.

Water does not become non-sentient simply by being heated; therefore, the term "tattafasuy" is used in the Dashavaikalik Sutra. Otherwise, the term "tatt" alone would have sufficed. It is not necessary for it to be "prasauk" (suitable for drinking) even when heated. Water placed on fire remains mixed (misra) until it boils three times. In the first boil, it becomes non-sentient to a small extent. In the second boil, it becomes non-sentient to a greater extent, and in the third boil, it becomes completely non-sentient. Rainwater, if it falls in a place where humans and animals move, remains mixed for some time. If rainwater falls outside villages and towns, it remains mixed until it becomes non-sentient due to contact with the earth (prithvikaay). If there is heavy rainfall, the water that falls first becomes mixed due to contact with the earth, but the water that falls later remains sentient.

The author mentions three beliefs regarding rice water. The water that drips from the vessel used to wash rice into other vessels remains mixed until it is destroyed. Another belief is that the rice water is considered mixed until the bubbles that form on the surface of the water when it is poured from the washing vessel into another vessel subside. The third belief is that the rice water remains mixed until the rice is cooked.

**Pindaniyukti: An Observation**

These three views cannot be definitively one form and truth because the points on a rough vessel dry quickly, while the points on a smooth vessel take time to dry. Water bubbles also quickly subside with a strong wind, but can remain for some time in a gentle breeze. There is also no uniformity in the third order. Rice that has been soaked in water for a long time, is old, has sufficient fuel material below, and has the addition of sweet water, cooks quickly. In the opposite situation, rice takes longer to cook. Explaining this, the author says that until the tandulodak (rice water) becomes completely pure, it should be considered mixed. According to the commentator, if another conscious water is added to the unrefined chaulodak (rice water), both waters become refined for a long time.

According to the commentator Malayagiri, if conscious water is added to a vessel containing curd and oil, and a thick layer (layer) of curd or oil forms on top, then that water becomes unconscious in one pourushi (unit of time), unconscious in two pourushi with a medium layer, and unconscious in three pourushi with a thin layer.

Rainwater falling on a clay mortar on the roof of a house becomes unconscious due to contact with the smoke and heat on the roof. After the rain stops, that water can be taken as it becomes unconscious. When it rains, the water is mixed, so it should be taken after the rain stops. According to the churnikar (author of a commentary), in the summer season, hot water becomes conscious again after one day and night, and in the winter and rainy seasons, hot water made in the morning becomes conscious by evening. According to the Pravachnasaroaddhar (a commentary), in the hot season, after five prahar (units of time), in the cold season after four prahar, and in the rainy season after three prahar, the prasauk (water used for drinking) also becomes conscious again. According to the commentator, prasauk water also becomes conscious after three prahar. Adding ash does not make it conscious again, but it cleanses even dirty water.

According to the commentator, water does not remain conscious for a long time when mixed with a substance that has intense color, smell, taste, and touch. If the bad color, smell, etc. are intense, then that water becomes unconscious quickly. If the color, smell, etc. are good, then it becomes refined for a long time. The time taken for water to become unconscious from conscious also varies based on touch. Due to its bitter taste, sandalwood is the weapon of tandulodak, but because the touch of sandalwood is cool, tandulodak becomes unconscious or refined for a long time. Similarly, in water that has come into contact with curd, etc., the sour taste is the weapon of water, but because its touch is cool, it becomes unconscious for a long time.

## Pindaniryukti

Because water is inherently non-sentient for a long time. The smell of ghee and raw meat - both are weapons of water, but their taste is sweet and touch is cold, therefore, their mixture makes water non-sentient for a long time. The acidity produced by the kukkus in chaulodak also becomes a weapon of water. If sentient water is added to the juice of a fruit, it becomes non-sentient for a long time.

## Tejaskaay

In the context of Tejaskaay, the Niyuktikar says that the middle part of the electricity that bakes bricks, the meteor, etc., is definitely sentient Tejaskaay. The word 'etc.' according to the commentator, also includes the fire used by the potter to bake the pot, the fire lit in the stove to cook the sugarcane juice. Angara, Murmur, Agni, Archi, Jwala, Ulka, Vidyut, etc., are practical sentient Tejaskaay. The fire produced from unbreakable Vajra, Vidyut, and Suryakant Mani, etc., is accepted as sentient. Karishagni mixed Tejaskaay.

## Vayukaay

The wind that blows when there is a dense cloud, thin wind, excessive snowfall, and darkness caused by clouds, that wind is definitely sentient. The wind blowing in the east, etc., direction is practically sentient. The author has mentioned five types of non-sentient wind:

* **Aakrant:** The wind that comes out from mud, etc., that is trampled by feet.
* **Dhamat:** The wind that comes out from the mouth and the wind filled in the bellows.
* **Ghan:** The wind that comes out from the sesame crushing machine. In the commentary of Thanam and Oghniryukti, there is a reference to Sammurcchhi Vayu in place of Ghan, which means the wind produced from the palate, etc.
* **Dehanugat:** The wind that comes out from the anus and the form of inhalation-exhalation.
* **Peelit:** The wind that comes out from squeezing wet clothes.

According to the commentator Abhaydevsuri, these five types of wind are non-sentient at the time of their origin, but they can also become sentient in the end.

## Pinḍaniryukti: An Observation

The commentator has considered the air that comes out of the palate as *achitt* (non-conscious) based on the word *ādi* (beginning). However, the *Daśavaikalika Sūtra* prohibits the *sādhu* (saint) from blowing air from the palate, etc. This clearly indicates that the prohibition is due to the air being *saccitt* (conscious). The *niryuktikāra* (author of the *niryukti*) has also elaborated on the determination of *miśra vāyukāya* (mixed air body) and its *saccitt* and *achitt* nature within the *vāyukāya* (air body).

If *achitt* air is filled into a *dṛti* (leather bag) made of skin and its mouth is tightly tied with a rope, and then it is released into the water of a river, the air inside the *dṛti* remains *achitt* for up to one hundred *hastas* (cubits). It becomes *miśra* (mixed) in the second hundred *hastas* and *saccitt* as soon as it enters the third hundred *hastas*. After that, it remains *saccitt*. This is a description of the duration for which the air remains *miśra* or *saccitt* from the perspective of the area.

From the perspective of time, the *bhāṣyakāra* (commentator) explains that the air inside the *dṛti* remains *achitt* for one *prahara* (watch) during *ekānta snigdha kāla* (very moist time). It becomes *miśra* at the beginning of the second *prahara* and *saccitt* at the beginning of the third *prahara*. During *madhyama snigdha kāla* (moderately moist time), it remains *achitt* for two *praharas*, becomes *miśra* in the third *prahara* and *saccitt* in the fourth *prahara*. During *jighanya snigdha kāla* (least moist time), the air inside the *dṛti* remains *achitt* for three *praharas*, becomes *miśra* in the fourth *prahara* and *saccitt* in the fifth *prahara*. The same should be understood for *rūkṣa kāla* (dry time). There, instead of *praharas*, the number of days should be increased. During *jighanya rūkṣa kāla* (least dry time), the air inside the *vasti* (body) remains *achitt* for one day, becomes *miśra* on the second day and *saccitt* on the third day. During *madhyama rūkṣa kāla* (moderately dry time), it remains *achitt* for two days, becomes *miśra* on the third day and *saccitt* on the fourth day. During *utkṛṣṭa rūkṣa kāla* (most dry time), it remains *achitt* for three days, becomes *miśra* on the fourth day and *saccitt* on the fifth day.

## Vanaspatikāya (Plant Body)

All *anantakāya* (infinite body) plants are *saccitt* according to the *niścaya naya* (certainty view). Every plant is *saccitt* according to the *vyavahāra naya* (practical view). *Mlāna* (wilted) and *ardha śuṣka* (semi-dry) plants are *miśra*. Rice flour is *miśra*. According to the commentator, freshly ground wheat porridge is *miśra*. A *śami* (Acacia suma) pod that has been roasted once also remains *saccitt* and *miśra*. Leaves, flowers, tender fruits, rice, green stems, etc., become *achitt* when they dry. *Utpala* (blue lotus) and *padma* (red lotus) become *achitt* before one *prahara* when kept in the sun. *Uṣṇayonika* (heat-born) plants become *mlāna* due to rain. *Magadantika* (a type of flower) and *jūhi* (jasmine) flowers, being *uṣṇayonika*, remain *saccitt* for a long time even when kept in the sun. *Magadantika* flowers become *achitt* before one *prahara* when put in water. *Utpala* and *padma*, being *udakayonika* (water-born), can remain *saccitt* for a long time in water.

According to Pindaniyukti, plants like Pippali, Khajur, Daak and Harde become Achitt (inanimate) when transported beyond a hundred Yojanas. The commentator has also given other reasons for their becoming Achitt.

If grains like Yav, Yavyav, Godhum, Shalyodan and Brihi are stored in a granary and sealed with a lid after plastering it from above, then due to the vacuum, these grains can remain Sachitt (animate) for a short period of time (Antarmuhurt) in the worst case and for three years in the best case. If pulses like Til, Moong, Masoor, Matar, Urad, Chawla, Kulath, Arhar, Black Chana, Vall-Nishpav etc. are stored in a granary and properly sealed and marked so that air cannot enter the granary, then these grains can remain Sachitt for a short period of time (Antarmuhurt) in the worst case and for five years in the best case. If seeds of oilseeds like Atasi, Latt-Kusumbh, Kangu, Kodusag-Kordushak, San, Varatt-Barath, Siddharsarsons, Kodrav, Ralak and Mooli are stored in a granary and properly sealed, then these seeds can remain Sachitt for a short period of time (Antarmuhurt) in the worst case and for seven years in the best case. After that, they become Abeej (seedless). Generally, all grains can become Achitt after a short period of time (Antarmuhurt) in the worst case. The best case scenario is different for each.

Thus, the Niyuktikar has presented a beautiful discussion of the state of Sachitt, Achitt and Mishr (mixed) of sthavar (stationary) objects. Some material about this is also found scattered in Jain Agamas. Bhikchacharya

Food is a basic necessity of life. Life cannot be sustained for long without it. Munis take food to keep their journey of restraint going smoothly. Eating for taste is forbidden for Munis. In the story of the Seth and the thief in the Jnata Dharmakatha, it is beautifully expressed that Munis do not take food for the sake of beauty, growth, strength and satisfaction of the senses, but for the development of knowledge, vision and character. Even if one who eats for all this is a Prasaukhabhoji (one who eats for the sake of taste), he is still an Aprashast Pratisevi (one who does not eat properly). In Mulachar, there is a directive for Munis that they should consume food that is cold-hot, rough-dry, oily-non-oily, salty or unsalted without tasting it.

Bhikchacharya is an integral part of the Sadhu's conduct. Whatever a Muni receives, he receives it through Bhikcha. 1. Bribha 974.

**Pinḍaniyukti: An Observation**

It is stated in the Āgama that among all the yogas of a Muni, bhikṣācaryā is the primary yoga. In Vyavahāra Bhāṣya, it is mentioned that a Muni who experiences laziness or carelessness in bhikṣācaryā is a mandasṁvigna (slow renunciate), and one who is diligent and enterprising in bhikṣācaryā is a tīvrasṁvigna (intense renunciate).

The bhikṣā of Jain ascetics is different from that of ordinary mendicants. They accept bhikṣā that is flawless and free from any harm. If a Muni accepts or approves of food that is obtained through running away, fleeing, causing suffering, or initiating an action, then his fasting, svādhyāya, and other yogas are destroyed like nectar in a broken vessel.

The bhikṣācaryā of a Muni, based on complete non-violence, is bound by numerous rules and sub-rules. The method of bhikṣā, which is pure in nine ways and free from 42 faults, is not found in either the Buddhist tradition or the Vedic tradition. The Buddha considered purposeful, purchased, and requested food as acceptable. The first study of the famous Jain text Daśavaikālika begins with the non-violent bhikṣāvrutti of a Muni. The ascetic resolves in the language of the Uttama Puruṣa, "May we obtain such a livelihood (bhikṣāvrutti) that does not cause suffering to anyone." This is a vow voluntarily accepted by the Muni, not imposed by anyone.

The bhikṣācaryā of an ascetic is also called vr̥tti-saṁkṣepa. It is not about obtaining desired substances, but about being content with whatever is received. Expressing reverence for the method of flawless bhikṣā presented by the omniscient ones, Ācārya Śayyambhava says in the Daśavaikālika Sūtra, "Oh, how the Jinas have made this provision for the livelihood of the wealthy!"

In the Aṣṭakaprakarṇa, Haribhadra has written three chapters related to bhikṣā. In the Bhikṣāṣṭaka Prakarṇa, he mentions three types of bhikṣācaryās: 1. Sarvasampatkari, 2. Pauraṣaghnī, 3. Vr̥ttibhikṣā. Accepting pure bhikṣā while avoiding faults is Sarvasampatkari bhikṣā. Obtaining bhikṣā through conduct contrary to saṁyaktva without working in the garb of a śramaṇa is Pauraṣaghnī bhikṣā. And the bhikṣāvrutti that is relied upon by the poor, lowly, disabled, and destitute as a means of livelihood is Vr̥ttibhikṣā. A Nirgrantha ascetic does not engage in either Pauraṣaghnī bhikṣā or Vr̥ttibhikṣā. He fulfills his needs through Sarvasampatkari bhikṣā.

##  44. Pinḍaniyukti

This fulfills the need, which is also called Madhukari Bhiksha or Gochari. Just as a bumblebee takes a little nectar from flowers, which does not cause pain to the flowers and also satisfies it, in the same way, a sadhu should take a little food from the food prepared for the householder, so that the householders do not suffer and the sadhu's life journey continues properly.

The Uttaradhyayanasutra and the Rishibhashit' text also mention the Kapoti Vritti for the sadhu's Bhiksha. Just as a pigeon is apprehensive every moment while pecking at a grain of rice, in the same way, a muni engaged in Bhikshacharya is apprehensive about the faults of Eshana. A special characteristic of the muni's Bhiksha is - Agnatunchha. The Bhikshu takes Bhiksha from unknown families in a communal way, that is, without prior instructions.

The muni takes Navakoti Vishuddha Ahar. Navakoti means that the sadhu does not kill himself, nor does he get anyone killed, nor does he approve of the killer. He does not cook himself, nor does he get anyone to cook, nor does he approve of cooking. The muni does not buy himself, nor does he get anyone to buy, nor does he approve of buying. According to the Digambar tradition, he does not do, cause, or approve of anything through mind, speech, and body. Multiplying three by three gives Navakoti Parishuddha Bhiksha.

Acharyas have discussed in detail who is eligible to receive Bhiksha, i.e., Pindakalpik, and what are their qualifications. The reason for this is that a muni who does not know the Bhikshavidhi or its rules cannot perform Samyak Eshana. According to Vyavahar Bhashya, in ancient times, a muni became Pindakalpik after reading the Amagandhi Sutra of Acharanga both in terms of meaning and text, but nowadays, he becomes Pindakalpik after reading the Pindeshana study of Dashavaikalik. The Brihatkalpa Bhashya clearly states that if someone has not read the Acharachula Gat Pindeshana and the fifth Pindeshana study of Dashavaikalik, then the Acharya has to perform a penance of four Guru Maas (fasting) for sending him to Gochari. If he is sent without explaining the meaning, or even if the meaning is explained but the other person has not understood or has no faith, or if he is sent even if he has faith but has not been tested, then he gets a penance of four small months (Ayambil) each.

**Pinḍaniyukti: An Observation**

**Difference between Bhikshavṛtti and Bhiksha**

There is a world of difference between the bhikshavṛtti of a sādhū and the bhiksha of a destitute person. Firstly, there are no rules or commitments in the bhiksha of a beggar; he begs from one house to another in a pleading tone. On the other hand, a sādhū, with humility (Daśa 5/2/26) and self-respect, accepts bhiksha offered by others for the attainment of the perfection of the vows. A beggar collects wealth or material for future worries, whereas a sādhū does not even store food for the evening, even if it is collected in the morning. In other words, he cannot consume the bhiksha received in the first watch in the last watch. A sādhū accepts with respect, humility, and persistence, while a beggar desires more even after receiving what is due. A sādhū remains equanimous, without feeling sorrow or disrespect if he does not receive bhiksha, whereas a beggar sometimes becomes agitated and starts talking nonsense if he does not receive bhiksha. A sādhū collects bhiksha by going to many houses and working hard, while a beggar can fulfill his needs from one house. Mahāvīra has kept the self-respect of a sādhū so alive that if a beggar or another bhikshavṛtti is already present in a house, the muni will not enter that house.

**How many times is bhiksha allowed for a muni?**

According to the Āgamas, the third watch of the day is considered the time for bhiksha for a nitya-bhakti muni. In the Daśāśrutaskandha, one of the 20 asamādhi-sthānas is to eat from sunrise to sunset. The mention of "egbhattam ca bhoyanam" (Daśa 6/22) points towards the dietary restraint of a sādhū. A fasting muni is allowed to go for bhiksha only once, but if food and water are not available in sufficient quantity, he can go twice.

Two gocharakālas are allowed for those practicing bela tapasya, and three gocharakālas are allowed for those practicing tela tapasya. For those practicing tapasya beyond tela, three gocharakālas are allowed. A person practicing bela tapasya can go for bhiksha twice because the intestines shrink during bela tapasya, and eating more frequently helps regain the strength to practice bela tapasya again, and the food also does not get cold.

---------------------------
## Pindaniyukti

If food is brought once and kept for the evening, it can also be a reason for reluctance to eat cold food, therefore, it is permissible for a Bele tapasvi to go for alms twice.
If the fasting person goes for alms for the third time, he gets Laghumas (Purimardh), for the fourth time, Guru-mas (Ekasana), for the fifth time, Charlagghu (Ayambil), for the sixth time, Charguru (Upvas), for the seventh time, Chalagghu, for the eighth time, Chhaguru, for the ninth time, Chhed, for the tenth time, Mul, for the eleventh time, Anvasthapy, and for the twelfth time, Paranchik Prayashchitta. Similarly, for a Bele, going for alms for the twelfth time is a provision for Paranchik Prayashchitta. For an Ashtamabhaktik-Tele, going for alms from the fourth time to the thirteenth time results in Paranchik Prayashchitta.

**46**

According to the Digambar tradition, the middle time between three ghadi after sunrise and three ghadi before sunset is the time for food for a Muni. Eating in three Muhurtas during the middle time is excellent, two Muhurtas is moderate, and one Muhurta is inferior. Eating in one Muhurta is excellent conduct, two Muhurtas is moderate conduct, and eating in three Muhurtas is inferior conduct.

**Eshana and its faults**

The walking, talking, eating, keeping of equipment, and excretion of a Sadhu are all different from a householder, therefore, his correct actions are called Samiti. Among the five Samitis, the Samiti related to Bhikchacharya is called Eshana. Jain Acharyas have given great importance to pure Bhikcha Vritti. Vrat, Sheel, etc. qualities are based on the purity of Bhikchacharya or Eshana. In the Bhashya literature, it is mentioned that where there are faults of Eshana like Karma, etc., the Sadhu should not go for alms. Unawareness in Eshana is the twentieth Asamadhi Sthan. Explaining this, the commentator Abhaydevsuri says that one who is not suitable in Eshana is inclined towards violence. When other Munis warn him, he becomes involved in conflict, remaining in Asamadhi himself and becoming the cause of Asamadhi for others. According to Acharya Battke, those who wander after purifying their Bhikcha, Vachan, and Hriday, are called well-established Sadhus in the Jinashasana. Acharya Kundkund has even said that a Muni who practices pure Bhikcha Eshana is an Anahari even while eating. The Uttaradhyayanasutra clearly states that one who is Auddeshik, Krit

## Pinḍaniryukti: An Observation

One who does not abandon the non-eshanīya (non-permissible) food, even though he knows it is non-permissible, becomes like fire, consuming everything and accumulating sinful karma. He dies and attains a lower rebirth. According to Chūrṇikār Jinadās, if a monk does not get enough eshanīya food, he should reduce his intake and eat only one mouthful, but he should not consume non-eshanīya food.

In the Pañcāśak Prakaraṇa, three synonyms for eshanā are found: gaveshanā, anveshanā, and grahana. The meaning of eshanā is to be careful in the search, acquisition, and consumption of food. It has three divisions: gaveshanā, grahaneshanā, and paribhogeshanā.

Gaveshanā includes 16-16 faults related to origin and production, grahaneshanā includes 10 faults like doubt, and paribhogeshanā includes five faults like combination. Counting all these faults, there are 47 faults in bhikṣācārya, but the texts usually mention only 46 faults of bhikṣā. Explaining this, the commentators say that the 16 faults of origin include the inclusion of adhyavapūraka in miśrajāta, thus reducing the faults of origin to 15. This makes the faults of bhikṣācārya 46. If the five faults of paribhogeshanā are not included, there are only 41 faults of bhikṣā. According to Ācārya Kundakunda, a monk who eats food with 46 faults with an impure mind falls into the state of a lower being and suffers great pain. Chūrṇikār Jinadās has included only the 10 faults of grahaneshanā, like doubt, in the word eshanā. The Uttarādhyayana instructs on the purity of all three types of eshanā. According to the Daśavaikalika Niyukti, the description of all three types of eshanā is quoted from the Karmapravāda. The greatness of Pinḍaniryukti can be understood from the fact that a whole independent text has been written on the method of bhikṣā alone. In the first verse of Pinḍaniryukti, eshanā and paribhogeshanā are included in the eight-fold Pinḍaniryukti. The same thing is included in the eight-fold Pinḍavishuddhi in the Mūlācāra: 1. Udgaman 2. Utpādan 3. Eshanā 4. Sanyojana 5. Pramāṇa 6. Ingāla 7. Dhūma 8. Kārana.

10 Udgaman Faults

##  Translation:

8. These are called **Pindaniyukti** faults. The author has mentioned three synonyms for the word **udgama** - **udgama**, **udgopana** and **margana**. In the **Panchashak Prakaran** and **Panchavastu**, Acharya Haribhadra has considered **udgama**, **prasooti** and **prabhava** as synonyms for **udgama**. The **niyuktikara** has mentioned the origin of many things like **jyotish**, **trna**, **rna** etc. in the **dravya udgama**. In this context, the story of **Laddhukpriyakumar** is described. The sixteen faults of **udgama** can be divided into two categories - **avishodhikati** and **vishodhikati**. The category that causes many faults in the **gachchha** is **avishodhikati**. This category is of nine types - **self-harm**, **causing harm to others**, and **approving harm**, **digestion**, **digestion**, and **approving digestion** - these six categories are under **avishodhikati**, and the last three - **self-purchase**, **causing purchase**, and **approving purchase** - these three are under **vishodhikati**. Multiplying these nine by **raga-dvesha** gives 18, multiplying by **mithyatva**, **ajnan** and **aviraati** gives 27, and multiplying 27 by **raga-dvesha** gives 54 types. In another way, multiplying the original 9 types by **dashavidha shramanadharma** gives 90 types. Multiplying 90 by **gyan**, **darshan**, and **charitra** gives 270 types.

**Avishodhikati** can also be called **udgamakoti**. When the food contaminated by the fault is removed in that quantity, the remaining food becomes acceptable for the **muni**, that is called **vishodhikati**, and the food that is not acceptable for the **sadhu** even after removing the contaminated part, is called **avishodhikati**. **Adhakarma**, **auddeshik**, **pootikarma**, **mishrajat**, **badar prabhritika** and the last two types of **adhyavtar** - these come under **avishodhikati**. Even in this, some types of **auddeshik**, **mishrajat** and **adhyavtar** are included in **avishodhikati** and some in **vishodhikati**. For example, all three types of **vibhaga auddeshik** come under **avishodhikati**. The last two types of **adhyavpurka** - **swagruhapashandimishra** and **swagruhasadhุมishra** - these two are in **avishodhikati**, and **swagruhayavadarthikamishra** is included in **vishodhikati**.

## Pinḍaniryukti: An Observation

**Lepkṛd** or **Alekpṛd** substances, containing elements of **Aviseodhikōṭi**, if mixed with pure food, require the vessel to be cleansed three times (**Kalpatraya**) even after discarding the food. Otherwise, **Pūti Dosa** occurs.

The author raises a question: Some individuals, due to weakness, accept that someone prepared **Ādhākarmik** rice. In this case, the rice is **Ādhākarmik**, but the remaining **Avashrāvaṇa**, **Kāñji**, etc., are not **Ādhākarmik** because they were not prepared for the **Sādhu**. Therefore, food in contact with them does not become **Pūti**.

The commentator and the commentator explain that **Bhadrabahu Svāmī** believes that if the rice is **Ādhākarmik**, then the **Kāñjik** and **Avashrāvaṇa** will also be **Ādhākarmik**.

The remaining **Ogh**, **Auddeshik**, **Mishrajāt**'s primary division (**Yāvadārthikamiśra**), **Upakaraṇapūti**, **Sthāpanā**, **Sūkṣma Prābhṛtika**, **Prāduṣkaraṇa**, **Kṛta**, **Prāmitya**, **Parivartita**, **Abhyāhrta**, **Udbhinna**, **Mālāpahṛta**, **Ācchhedya**, **Anisṛṣṭa**, **Adhyavapūraka**'s primary division (**Swagṛhayāvadārthik**) - all these faults fall under **Aviseodhikōṭi**.

In the context of **Aviseodhikōṭi**, the author explains **Viveka** in detail. Using **Chaturbhangi**, the author states:

* If **Vishodhikōṭi** dry **Vall** etc. fall into pure dry **Chan** etc., they can be easily separated without water-washing.
* If **Vishodhikōṭik** moist **Tīman** etc. fall into pure dry **Chan** etc., then **Kāñjik** etc. can be added to remove the impure **Tīman**.
* In the third **Bhang**, if **Vishodhikōṭik** dry **Chan** etc. are added to pure moist **Tīman**, then the **Chan** etc. can be removed by hand.
* In the fourth **Bhang**, if a mixture of **Vishodhikōṭi** moist **Tīman** is added to impure moist **Tīman**, then if it is a rare substance that cannot be recovered, then the portion should be removed with **Aṣṭha Bhāva**, and the rest should be discarded. If it can be done without it, then the whole should be discarded because it is not possible to separate moist from moist.

The sixteen faults of **Udgma Dosa** are as follows:

1. **Ādhākarma**
2. **Auddeshik**
3. **Pūtikarma**
4. **Mishrajāt**
5. **Sthāpanā**
6. **Prābhṛtika**

The first fault of Udgam is Adhakarma. The food etc. produced by killing beings, taking the Sadhu as the basis, is Adhakarma. Navangi Tika-kar Abhaydev Suri, while explaining Adhakarma, has said that to make the sentient object insentient, to build houses etc., and to weave clothes etc., keeping the Sadhu in mind, is Adhakarma. According to the Bhashyakar, it is not only Adhakarma that is produced by killing beings. Even if an insentient object is produced for the Sadhu, it is Adhakarma. In Dasha-shruta-skandha, Adhakarma is considered the fourth Shabala Dosha in the twenty-one Shabala Doshas of food enjoyment. According to Brihatkalpa-bhashya, Adhakarma Dosha is of two types: 1. The one that harms the Mulaguna, 2. The one that harms the Uttaragunas.

German scholar Layman has done a Sanskrit shadow of 'Ahakamma' as per his wish. According to him, producing food according to the wish of the Sadhu is Adhakarma. Based on this concept, Acharya Mahaprajna, in Bhagavati Bhashya, while explaining the word Adhakarma, says that the Muni who eats food as per his wish is devoid of compassion towards the six-bodied beings like Prithvikaaya etc. This implies that the meaning of eating food as per one's wish is that the householder wants to make something for the Muni according to his wish, the Muni gives his consent for it, or the Muni inspires the householder to make food according to his wish.

Among all the faults of Udgam, Adhakarma Dosha is the most cautious. The Niyuktikar says that just as food becomes inedible after vomiting, similarly, Adhakarma food becomes inedible and uneatable for the Muni. Giving a worldly example, the author says that just as sheep, camel milk, garlic, onion, liquor, and beef etc. are considered inedible and unacceptable in the Vedic scriptures, similarly:

## Pindianiyukti: An Observation

In the 51 Jain scriptures, food that is *Ahadkarma* is considered inedible and unacceptable. According to Acharya Kundakunda, a monk who indulges in *Ahadkarma* food abandons the path to liberation.

The severity of the *Ahadkarma* fault is evident in the fact that a monk cannot eat in a house where *Ahadkarma* food is known for three days. That house is considered polluted for three days. The Bhagavati Sutra clearly states that a *Nirgrantha* who consumes *Ahadkarma* binds himself to the remaining seven *karma* types, excluding *Ayukarma*, with strong bonds, long-lasting effects, intense experiences, and extensive scope. Acharya Vattkekar says that a monk who consumes *Ahadkarma* food, which arises from the destruction of the six-bodied beings, is not a true monk but rather a *Shravak* (lay follower) due to his ignorance and greed for the tongue. The commentator of the Mulachar goes so far as to say that such a person is not even a *Shravak* because he is devoid of Dharma. A virtuous person with a mind that approves of digestion and assimilation, who is not afraid of the violence caused by such food, is a self-murderer even while eating. Such a monk, corrupted by worldly desires, has no future in this life or the next. His wearing the robes of a monk is meaningless without restraint.

The gravity of the *Ahadkarma* fault can be understood from the fact that even if a monk mentally desires *Ahadkarma*, he binds himself to karmas even while consuming *Prasauk* (acceptable) food. The Sutra-Kritanga clearly states in this context that if a monk knows that the food is contaminated with *Ahadkarma* and other faults, he should not eat it himself, nor should he feed it to others, nor should he approve of those who eat it.

The author of *Pindianiyukti* explains the term *Ahadkarma* through nine doors: 1. The name of *Ahadkarma*, 2. Its meaning, 3. For whom is *Ahadkarma* intended, 4. The nature of *Ahadkarma*, 5. The opposing side, 6. The supporting side, 7. Four roles: transgression, violation, etc., 8. The consumption of *Ahadkarma*, 9. Faults like disobedience and violation.

The *Pindavishuddhiprakaran* also mentions nine doors, but with some differences. In *Pindianiyukti*, the doors are indicated in the form of questions, while in *Pindavishuddhiprakaran*, they are in the form of pronouns. There, the doors are: 1. *Yatjo* (nature), 2. *Yasy* (whose), 3. *Yatha* (in what form the *Ahadkarma* fault is incurred), 4. *Yadrish* (vomiting).

## Clarification of Aadhākarma by Analogy
5. Doshas 6. Aadhākarma 7. Yathāpr̥cchā - Vidhi - Parihār 8. Chhalnā 9. Shuddhi |
## Names of Aadhākarma
A question arises in these nine doors: why did the author separately instruct on the names and the one-meaning (ekārthak) doors? Because the names of Aadhākarma are the same as the one-meaning. In resolving this question, it can be said that the author has mentioned eight words in the names of Aadhākarma, and only four words are indicated in the one-meaning: Aadhākarma, Adhah Karma, etc. Pratisevna, etc., cannot be one-meaning of Aadhākarma, but Aadhākarma is used through them. Therefore, by treating the cause as non-different, Pratisevna, Pratiśravaṇa, Samvās, and Anumodana have also been included under the name of Aadhākarma.
## Aadhākarma Food Brought by Another Sadhu
A Sadhu who eats Aadhākarma food brought by another Sadhu and serves it to other Sadhus is afflicted with the Pratisevna dosha. A Sadhu who says, "I did not bring Aadhākarma food, I am only enjoying food brought by others, therefore I am pure because a person who pulls embers from another's hand does not get burned himself," is explained by the Niyuktikār as a fool who does not understand the meaning of the scriptures. Even if he did not bring it himself, the Sadhu is still contaminated by the Pratisevna dosha.
## Explanation of Pratisevna, etc.
The Niyuktikār explains the four terms, Pratisevna, etc., by saying that a Muni invited four Sadhus for Aadhākarma food. The first Muni accepted the invitation. The second said, "I will not enjoy Aadhākarma food, you all do." The third Sadhu remained silent after hearing him but performed Samvās with them, and the fourth explicitly refused and left their company. The first Muni was contaminated by the Pratisevna dosha, he was also contaminated by these three yogas: mind, speech, and body. The second Muni incurred the verbal dosha of Pratiśravaṇa, and also the mental dosha of Anumodana in the form of an indication. The third Muni, who remained silent, incurred the mental dosha of Anumodana due to Samvās. The fourth Muni remained free from all these doshas.
## Doshas of Aadhākarma Food
Four doshas are incurred by the one who consumes Aadhākarma food, three doshas by the one who performs Pratiśravaṇa, two doshas by the one who stays with the Aadhākarma eater, and one dosha by the one who performs Anumodana. Among these,
1. Pinni 68 / 2, 3.
2. According to the Tikākār, even if a Sadhu serves Aadhākarma food brought by another to other Sadhu-like Munis, he is still afflicted with the Pratisevna dosha (Mavṛ P. 47).

From the perspective of offense, *pratisevna* is the most serious, the rest are progressively less serious: *pratiśravana*, *sanvās*, and *anumoḍana*.  To further clarify *pratiśravana*, the *niyuktikār* states that if an *ādhākarma* criticizes the food while the *ācārya* uses the term "sulābhda" - you have received good - then they are also guilty of the *pratiśravana* offense. *Sanvās* means to live with the *ādhākarma* eater. To clarify why *sanvās* is prohibited, the *niyuktikār* states that the sight, smell, and discussion of the *ādhākarma* food can attract even the well-behaved and austere monks, therefore living with the *ādhākarma* eater can also lead to offense. *Anumoḍana* means to praise. Even if a monk does not consume the *ādhākarma* food, but says that these monks are blessed who receive food that is seasonal, smooth, delicious, and sufficient with respect, this *anumoḍana* also makes him guilty of the *ādhākarma* offense. Although the one who praises does not consume it, his viewpoint is false due to supporting the mistake, therefore he is considered contemptible. The *Sūtrakṛtāṅga Sūtra* clearly states in the *samādhi* study that a *sādhu* should not desire *ādhākarma* food in any situation, nor should he praise or support those who desire *ādhākarma*. The *niyuktikār* has indicated four examples to clarify these four: *pratisevna* - a thief, *pratiśravana* - a prince, *sanvās* - a merchant living in a village, and *anumoḍana* - a wicked king.

**One-Word Synonyms for *Ādhākarma***

The author has mentioned three one-word synonyms for *ādhākarma*: 1. *Adhaḥkarma*, 2. *Ātmaghna*, and *Ātmakarma*. The *Sūyagado* also uses the word *Āhakad-Ādhākṛta* for this.

*Adhaḥkarma* - By consuming *ādhākarma* food, the *samyama sthāna*, *samyama śreṇī*, *leśyā*, and the state of auspicious actions, the present auspicious *adhyavasāya* becomes inferior to the most inferior. Therefore, by treating the cause with the effect, *ādhākarma* is named *Adhaḥkarma*. To explain this, the author gives the example of a monk with *Upaśānta moha* *cāritra*. According to him, even a monk with *Upaśānta moha* *cāritra* in the eleventh *guṇasthāna*, let alone a *sādhu* with the sixth *pramatta* *samyata* *guṇasthāna*, if he consumes *ādhākarma* food, he will:

**Pindaniyukti** (Pindaniyukti) leads to the downfall of the soul.  The **Moolachar** (Moolachar) illustrates this point through an example:  A monk who stands in **Viraasana** (Viraasana), practices **Kayotsarga** (Kayotsarga), maintains silence, meditates, fasts, and observes **bela** (bela), but is still involved in **Aadhkarma** (Aadhkarma) food consumption, renders all his efforts futile.

An **Aadhkarma** (Aadhkarma) eater not only binds his lifespan to a downward path but also directs other karmas towards the same. He accumulates karmas every moment, intensifying the binding and extraction of karmas associated with intense emotions. These heavy karmas drag him down.

An **Aadhkarma** (Aadhkarma) eater, by consuming food, harms the life force and beings, and also destroys his own knowledge, perception, and conduct. Therefore, **Aadhkarma** (Aadhkarma) is also called **Aatmaghna** (Aatmaghna) - the destroyer of the self. According to the text, the destruction of conduct leads to the destruction of knowledge and perception. However, from a practical perspective, the destruction of conduct leads to the loss of knowledge and perception.

An **Aadhkarma** (Aadhkarma) eater, consumed by negative emotions, connects himself to the actions of others, particularly the **Parakarma** (Parakarma) - the actions of householders, such as cooking and eating. Due to the complex consequences, he binds himself to karmas. Therefore, **Aadhkarma** (Aadhkarma) is also called **Aatmakarma** (Aatmakarma) - the action of the self.

A question arises regarding **Aatmakarma** (Aatmakarma): How can the actions of others be transferred? If this were possible, then a monk who has attained the **Kshapaka** (Kshapaka) stage could, out of compassion, absorb the karmas of others and destroy them. However, this is never possible.

In response to this question, Acharya Yashobhadrasurī presented the example of a deer and a trap. Explaining this, the commentator Malayagiri states that a skilled and vigilant deer avoids traps. Even if it gets caught in a trap, it escapes before the trap is closed. However, a careless and unskilled deer gets trapped. Therefore, simply being in the presence of others does not lead to karmic bondage. Similarly, simply preparing **Aadhkarma** (Aadhkarma) food by a householder does not bind the monk to **papakarma** (papakarma) - negative karma. A monk who, due to carelessness, consumes **Aadhkarma** (Aadhkarma) food with negative intentions, makes promises, associates with **Aadhkarma** (Aadhkarma) eaters, and approves of their actions, binds himself to the actions of others, particularly the **Parakarma** (Parakarma) - the actions of householders, such as cooking and eating.

## Pinḍaniryukti: An Observation

**55**

A muni who is free from negligence in thought, speech, and action does not acquire bondage, even though he may be creating it. This is explained in the Mulacara through the example of fish: just as fish become intoxicated when a narcotic substance is put into a lake, but frogs do not, similarly, a muni who takes food prepared by a householder with pure intention does not become entangled in demerit.

How can parakṛta karma be the cause of bondage? This is explained in the Jītakalpabhāṣya through an example: just as poison used by another is deadly for another, similarly, parakṛta action also becomes the cause of bondage for a jīva due to a particular intention.

**What is the ādhākarma for whom the food is prepared?**

The third gate related to ādhākarma is "kass" - that is, for whom the food is prepared is called ādhākarma. Explaining this, the Niyuktikāra says that, as a rule, food prepared for a sādharmika is called ādhākarma.

In this context, twelve deposits of sādharmika are made in Pinḍaniryukti, along with their detailed explanation in 22 gāthās. Here, some special facts related to ādhākarma related to sādharmika are being mentioned.

If a person's father's name is Devadatta, and after his death, his son resolves that, whether he is a householder or a sādhū, he will give food to all persons named Devadatta, then in this situation, that food is not considered appropriate for a sādhū named Devadatta because the name is sādharmika. If the householder resolves that he will feed all householders named Devadatta, then in this resolution, that food is considered appropriate for a muni named Devadatta. If his resolution is that he will feed all sādhūs named Devadatta, then in this mixed resolution, that food is not appropriate for a sādhū named Devadatta, but it is appropriate for all sādhūs with different names, such as Chaitra, etc. If the householder's resolution is that he will feed all sādhūs named Devadatta who are of other darshanas, then in this resolution, it is appropriate for the sādhū to take that food. If the householder has resolved for all śramaṇas, then this resolution is mixed, and even a nirgrantha sādhū is included in it, so that food is not appropriate for the sādhū. If the resolution is that he will feed all śramaṇas except nirgrantha sādhūs, then that food is appropriate for the sādhū. According to the tīkākara, if the tīrthankara and...

**Every Buddha** is a **kalpya** (permissible) for the **sadhu** (monk) because **Tirthankaras** and **Every Buddha** are **atiit** (transcended) from the **sangha** (community), they have risen above all **kalpas** (time cycles), therefore they are not **sadharmic** (of the same dharma) with the **sadhus**.

**56**

* If a **grihastha** (householder) makes a **lepyamayi** (clay) image of their deceased father or while he is alive and prepares **naivedya** (offering) for him, it is also of two types: 1. **Nishraakrut** 2. **Anishraakrut**. If the **grihastha** resolves that I will offer **naivedya** to the image of my father who is **rajoharanadhari** (one who has renounced worldly possessions), then it is called **Nishraakrut naivedya**. If it is prepared without any resolution, then it is called **Anishraakrut**. **Nishraakrut naivedya** is **akalpya** (impermissible) because it is **adhakarmi** (related to the five senses), and **Anishraakrut** is **kalpya** (permissible) but prohibited because it is **lokavirodh** (against the world). Similarly, the food prepared for the deceased **sadhu**'s body is called **mrutatnubhakt**. It is also of two types: **Nishraakrut** and **Anishraakrut**. The first is **akalpya** and the second is **kalpya** but prohibited.

* From the perspective of **kshetra** (region), if someone resolves that I will give **bhiksha** (food) to all the **sadhus** born in **Saurashtra** country, then that food is **akalpya** for the **sadhu** born in **Saurashtra** country, and **kalpya** for the rest. Similarly, **niyuktikar** (author of the text) and **tikaakar** (commentator) have described in detail about **sadharmic** in terms of **kal** (time), **pravachan** (discourse), **ling** (gender), **darshan** (philosophy), **gyan** (knowledge), **charitra** (conduct), **abhigraha** (attachment), and **bhavana** (feelings).

**What is Adhakaram?**

**Adhakaram** is the fourth **dwar** (gate) related to the subject. **Niyuktikar** explains that **adhakaram** is the constituent elements of **utpatti** (birth): **ashan** (food), **pan** (drink), **khadim** (smell), and **svadim** (taste) - these four. **Pindaniyuktikar** has described in detail only the **adhakaram** related to **aahar** (food), but in **Prashnavyakaran Sutra** it is mentioned that **vasati** (residence), **upaashray** (shelter), etc., if they are for the **sadhu**, then it is **adhakarmi**, its use is the cause of **asanyam** (non-restraint).

##  57.  Pinḍaniyukti: A Discussion of Observation

This discussion reveals the profound depth of the ancient Acharyas' analysis of this topic. Based on "kṛta" and "niṣṭhita," the four-fold classification is as follows:

* **Kṛta** for the ascetic, **niṣṭhita** for the ascetic.
* **Kṛta** for the ascetic, **niṣṭhita** for the householder.
* **Kṛta** for the householder, **niṣṭhita** for the ascetic.
* **Kṛta** for the householder, **niṣṭhita** for the householder.

The second and fourth categories in this four-fold classification are pure, and the ascetic can consume food from them. The first and third categories are impure, and it is inconceivable for the ascetic to consume food from them.

The nature of "kṛta" and "niṣṭhita" manifests in various forms. Generally, what is cooked or prepared is "niṣṭhita," and all actions prior to that are "kṛta." Another interpretation of "kṛta" and "niṣṭhita" is that from sowing to the second boiling is "kṛta," and the third boiling is "niṣṭhita."

The Jītakalpabhāṣya elaborates on these four categories. If someone sows grain for the ascetic, boils it three times, and cooks it for them, the Tirthankaras consider it a double "ādhākarma." The first "ādhākarma" is "kṛta" in form, and the second "ādhākarma" is "niṣṭhita" in the form of cooked rice. In this context, the commentator mentions the Vṛddhasampradāya, stating that if the rice is boiled once or twice for the ascetic, and the householder boils it a third time for themselves and appropriates it for their own use, then that rice is still permissible for the ascetic. The commentator also presents several other options in this context.

Regarding the "khādim," the author mentions a specific belief. Some Acharyas believe that even the shade of a tree grown for the ascetic should be avoided. In this context, the Niyuktikāra states that if the householder appropriates the fruits of a tree grown for the ascetic while picking them, then those fruits are still permissible for the ascetic, so why should the shade be avoided?

1. Jībhā 1157.
2. Mavṛ P. 66; There, from sowing to the second boiling is "kṛta," and the third boiling is "niṣṭhita."
3. Jībhā 1158.
4. Pini 80, Mavṛ P. 65.
5. Mavṛ P. 65, 66.

**Notes:**

* "Kṛta" refers to actions performed with the intention of benefiting an ascetic.
* "Niṣṭhita" refers to the final product or result of those actions.
* "Ādhākarma" refers to actions that create karmic consequences.
* "Khādim" refers to a type of tree that is considered auspicious for ascetics.
* "Vṛddhasampradāya" refers to an ancient tradition or school of thought.
* "Niyuktikāra" refers to the author of the Niyukti, a commentary on the Jītakalpabhāṣya.

##  Translation:

**58**

There is no **pindiya-niyukti** (application of the principle of **pindiya**). The reason for this is that even though a tree is **adhakarmic** (subject to the rules of **adhakarmic** conduct), its shade is not **adhakarmic** because the shade is caused by the sun, not just the tree. Just as a gardener cultivates a tree, the shade is not cultivated by him. The argument of the **niyuktikara** (one who applies the principle) is that if the shade of a tree is considered **adhakarmic** and its use is prohibited, then it would be permissible to sit under the tree when the sky is overcast and the tree's shade disappears. Another point is that the shade of a tree touches many houses and food, which would make those houses and food contaminated with **puti-dosha** (impurity). The shade is naturally caused by the sun, therefore it is not **adhakarmic**. If there are sentient particles scattered under the tree, then that place is **puti** (impure) and it is forbidden for a **sadhu** (Jain monk) to sit there.

**Roles in the Acceptance of Adhakarmic Conduct**

There are four roles in the acceptance of **adhakarmic** food that lead to the accumulation of **dosha** (negative karma). A monk who accepts **adhakarmic** food and consumes it incurs all four **doshas**: **atikram** (transgression), **vyatikram** (deviation), **aticar** (excess), and **anacar** (immorality). Accepting the invitation for **adhakarmic** food and seeking permission from the **guru** (spiritual teacher) is **atikram**. Lifting one's feet to reach the householder's house to bring the food is **vyatikram**. Accepting the **adhakarmic** food into the bowl is **aticar**, and swallowing it is **anacar**.

The first three roles do not break the **vrat** (vow), but the **anacar** role destroys the **vrat**. The ability to return to the original state is weakened. For example, in the **nupuraharica** (anklet-wearing woman) analogy, even though the elephant on the mountain peak with a broken tusk lifted three of its legs into the air, it still returned to the earth. But when all four legs were lifted, its destruction was certain. According to the **vyavahar-bhashya** (commentary on practical matters), the **pratyashchit** (atonement) for **atikram**, **vyatikram**, and **aticar** is **guru-mas** (one month of **ekasan** - sitting in one place), and for **anacar** it is **char-guru** (four months of fasting).

**The Doshas of Accepting Adhakarmic Food**

The **heyata** (undesirability) of **adhakarmic** food is described in many texts. Acharya Malayagiri says that just as a thousandth person is also killed by the effect of a thousand-fold poison, similarly, even a single bite of **adhakarmic** food can lead to death. In that situation, it would not be considered **anacar**. Some **acharyas** (teachers) consider placing **adhakarmic** food in the mouth to be **anacar**, but in this case, it is still possible to return to the original state. In this context, the **Jitatkalpa-bhashyakara** (commentator on the **Jitatkalpa** text) has argued that the act of placing food in the mouth allows the **sadhu** to return to the original state. He can spit out the food into the **shleeshmapaatra** (spittle pot).

**Pinḍaniyukti:** Even a single particle of observation, when it comes into contact with a thousandth person, can destroy the life of a monk's austerity.

The author of Niyukti has discussed the faults that arise from consuming Ādhākarma food at the final gate. There are four main types: 1. Violation of Jineshvara's command, 2. Anvasthā fault, 3. Attainment of Mithyātvā, 4. Virādhanā.

The Lord has said, "My Dharma lies in following the Dharma-command." A monk who consumes Ādhākarma food violates the Lord's command. What command does a monk who transgresses the command follow to complete other rituals of Sadhutva? This is expressed in another way in Mūlāchāra, saying that all the actions of a monk who consumes Ādhākarma food, such as living in the forest, living in a solitary house, and living at the root of a tree, are meaningless.

The second fault of consuming Ādhākarma is Anvasthā, i.e., the continuation of the fault. The Piṇḍavishuddhiprakaraṇa text raises a question: When a monk does not consume Ādhākarma food, does not cause it to be consumed, and does not approve of it, then what is the fault for a Trikaraṇa-shuddha monk in consuming Ādhākarma food prepared by a householder?

In response, the author says that if a monk knowingly consumes Ādhākarma food, it means that he encourages the occasion of preparing Ādhākarma food. When one monk sees someone consuming Ādhākarma food, he also starts consuming Ādhākarma food due to that influence. Seeing him, other monks also become inclined to consume Ādhākarma food. In this way, the tradition of many monks increases, leading to the severance of austerity and penance, resulting in the severance of the Tirtha. One who destroys the Tirtha becomes a participant in great Āshātanā.

The third fault of consuming Ādhākarma is the attainment of Mithyātvā. A Sadhu who does not follow the Āgama-prescribed method, without concealing his strength according to the country, time, and concentration, becomes a Mahāmithyādrishti due to creating doubt in others. Other Sadhus think that this person consumes Ādhākarma food even though he knows the truth, then the things said in the sermon must be false, thus creating doubt.

When a *pinḍanīyukti* occurs, it perpetuates the tradition of *mithyātva*. Additionally, the *rasalampata* muni, by indulging in his own and others' attachments, becomes ruthless and does not hesitate to consume living beings.
The fourth fault of accepting *ādhākarma* is *virādhaṇā*. Consuming excessive amounts of oily food makes the muni ill. Illness leads to the loss of *sūtra* and *artha* for him and his attendants. Treatment of the illness involves violence to the six bodies. If the attendants do not provide proper service, he experiences distress himself and, by becoming angry with the attendants, creates distress in their minds as well. In this way, he attains *ātmavirādhaṇā* and *sanyamavirādhaṇā*.
The fifth century of the *Bhagavati* mentions that a muni who mentally considers *ādhākarma* to be flawless, enjoys it himself considering it flawless, feeds others considering *ādhākarma* food to be flawless, and presents *ādhākarma* as flawless among the people, if he attains *kāladharma* without retracting from that place, becomes a *virādhaka*.
Illustrating the fault of *ādhākarma*, the *niyuktikāra* says that just as a beautiful gift, adorned with a coconut shell, becomes inedible if even a particle of dirt or other impurity touches it, similarly, pure food becomes inedible if it comes into contact with even a particle of *ādhākarma* food.
Purification of *ādhākarma* by the three *kalpas*
Even after emptying the vessel containing *ādhākarma* food, it remains contaminated until the three *kalpas* are performed. The *niyuktikāra* has explained the three *kalpas* in two ways. Cooking *ādhākarma* food in a vessel, removing it to another vessel and cleaning it thoroughly with a finger, is the first *lepa*. Similarly, the food remains contaminated until it is cleaned three times. If food is cooked in that vessel for the fourth time, it becomes pure. Alternatively, if the vessel is thoroughly washed three times and wiped with a cloth before cooking food, the food becomes pure. Similarly, if *ādhākarma* food enters the vessel of a *sādhu*, it must be purified by the three *kalpas* before consuming other food, otherwise, even pure food becomes contaminated.

**Pinḍaniyukti: An Observation**

The sixth gate related to Ādhākarma in the Piṇḍaviśuddhiprakaraṇa, "Taddāne Doṣa," is different from the gates of Piṇḍaniyukti. This gate is related to householders. Ādhākarma, which is the giving of food, disrupts the character of the ascetics, therefore householders should not use it in the path of Utsarga.

The author quotes an instance from the fifth śataka of Bhagavati that a person incurs the bondage of short lifespan due to three reasons: 1. Violence, 2. Lying, and 3. Giving unsuitable and inedible food to a true Śramaṇa. In the eighth śataka of Bhagavati, a fourfold classification of giving, recipient, what is to be given, and benefit is found. A restrained ascetic takes pure food.

* **Ekānta Nirjarā:** A restrained ascetic takes unsuitable food.
* **Bahut Nirjarā, Alp Pāpa:** An unrestrained person takes suitable and edible food.
* **Ekānta Pāpa, Nirjarā Nahīṁ:** An unrestrained person takes unsuitable and inedible food.

In this, the first classification - giving suitable and pure food - is pure. In the second classification, there is a desire for purity. The remaining two classifications are the cause of Ekānta Pāpa. The second option of this fourfold classification, giving unsuitable and inedible food to a restrained ascetic, is debatable. There is no mention of this kind in the Āgama literature in the context of Ādhākarma. While explaining this statement, the commentator Abhaydeva Sūri has said that here, due to being beneficial to character, Nirjarā and due to the killing of a living being, a lesser bondage is accepted. Jayācārya, quoting the opinion of Ācārya Bhiksu in the Joḍ of Bhagavati, has said that if the giver, knowing it to be pure in practice, gives inedible food unknowingly, then he has a lot of Nirjarā, but there is no bondage of sinful karma. Here, the word "Alp" is a negation indicator, yet both Abhaydeva Sūri and Ācārya Bhiksu have considered this instance to be only knowable by a Kevali. Ācārya Mahāprajña has explained this sūtra in detail in the Bhagavati Bhāṣya.

This instance has been explained in the Piṇḍaviśuddhiprakaraṇa in relation to the path of Utsarga and exception. If, in a situation of sustenance without expectation, a householder gives Ādhākarma food and an ascetic takes it, then this situation is harmful and meaningless for both. In the exception, it is acceptable in a situation of famine or illness. In this instance, the detailed commentary written by Ācārya Mahāprajña, the ninth commentary of Sūtrakṛtāṅga Part 2, page 304, is worth reading and pondering.

##  62. Avoiding *Aadhākarma*

The facts described in the seventh gate, named *Yathāpṛcchā*, in the *Piṇḍaviśuddhiprakaraṇa* are explained under the heading of *Piṇḍaniryukti* in the context of *vidhi* and *avidhi* avoidance. This topic is discussed separately in *Piṇḍaniryukti* after the explanation of the nine gates.

Knowing the faults caused by *ādhākarma*, a *sādhu* avoids it in two ways: 1. *Vidhi-parihāra* 2. *Avidhi-parihāra*. A *sādhu* who avoids *ādhākarma* through *avidhi* cannot properly follow the path of *sādhu* and cannot gain the benefits of knowledge, etc. In *avidhi-parihāra*, the author mentions the story of a *bhikṣu*. When the *bhikṣu* asked, the householder replied that this *śālyodana* came from *Gobaragrāma* in Magadha. To find out more, he started going to *Gobaragrāma*. Since he feared that the path might be constructed by *ādhākarmis*, he left the main path and started going through a difficult path full of thorns, snakes, etc. He also avoided the shade of trees, considering it to be *ādhākarmic*. He fainted on the way and started accumulating *saṃkleśa*.

In *vidhi-parihāra*, a *sādhu* pays attention to four things: *dravya*, *kula*, *deśa*, and *bhāva*. Explaining these, the author says that if an unlikely *dravya* is available in a particular *deśa*, if abundant food is available in a small family, and if the donation is given with excessive respect, then there might be a possibility of *ādhākarma*. If an item is commonly used by people in a particular place and is available in abundance, then there is no need for inquiry. For example, *maṇḍaka* (a type of bread) is abundant in the *Mālavā* region, so there is no fear of *ādhākarma* regarding that *dravya*. However, even there, if the family is small and the *dravya* is abundant, then there might be a suspicion of *ādhākarma*. If a donor is giving the donation disrespectfully, then also there is usually no fear of *ādhākarma*, because a donor who provides *ādhākarma* food usually also shows respect.

The author presents a psychological method to examine whether *ādhākarma* food has been prepared in a particular house or not. If, upon inquiry, the housewife says deceitfully that this food is prepared for the family members, not for you, and if other family members look at each other with suspicion or laugh shyly, then the *sādhu* should consider that food to be *ādhākarmic* and avoid it. If, upon inquiry, the donor

## Pinḍaniyukti: An Observation

**63** angrily says, "What do you care?" In such a situation, there is no fear of ādhākarma. The muni can eat without any doubt. Even if it is not known whether the food is pure or not, the niyuktikāra has given the solution that if the muni is seeking pure food appropriately, then even while consuming ādhākarma food, he is pure, i.e., he does not bind karma. If he is inappropriately consuming ādhākarma food from a mental perspective, then even while consuming prāsuka and eṣaṇīya food, he binds inauspicious karma.

In this context, the niyuktikāra has hinted at two stories. In one, a muni consumes pure food but mentally consumes it with the intellect of an ādhākarmic saṃgha-bhakta, due to which he binds karma. In the other, a māsa-kṣapaka muni, while engaged in the search for pure food, consumes ādhākarmic kheer and attains kaivalya. Explaining the reason, the author says that the first muni violated the command of the Bhagavān, therefore, even the enjoyment of pure food became a cause of binding of sin. The second, however, obeyed his command, therefore, even while consuming impure food, he crossed the ocean of samsara. In this context, the author has also given the example of the sunrise and moonrise gardens.

**The rule of consuming ādhākarma in the time of the Tīrthankaras**

Due to being ṛjuprajña sādhus and sādhvīs, except for the first and last Tīrthankaras, the remaining twenty-two Tīrthankaras and the Tīrthankaras of the Mahāvideha region have given so much leeway in ādhākarma piṇḍa that the food is not kalpya for the sādhus for whom it is made, but the rest of the sādhus can consume it. The bhāṣyakāra has presented a detailed discussion of this context. If the saṃgha of Bhagavān Ṛṣabha and Ajita are together, then if someone makes ādhākarma food for the entire saṃgha, then it is not kalpya for the sādhus of both the pañcayāmika and cātur-yāmika saṃghas. If ādhākarma food is made for the sādhus of Ṛṣabha, then it is acceptable for the cātur-yāmika sādhus of Ajita. If ādhākarma food is made for the cātur-yāmika sādhus, then that food is not kalpya for both.

If ādhākarma is made individually for a pañcayāmika sādhus of Ṛṣabha, then...

## Translation:

**64**

If a *pindanuyukti* is made for a *sadhu* who is a follower of Ajita, it is considered acceptable. If an *adhakarma* is performed with the intention of a *chaturyaamika sadhu*, it is unacceptable for both the *sadhus* of Rishabha and Ajita. This means that an *adhakarma* made with the intention of the *sangha* of the first and last *tirthankara* is not acceptable to anyone. If an *adhakarma* meal is made for a particular *sadhu*, it is not acceptable for any *sadhu* in the *sangha* of the first and last *tirthankara*. If an *adhakarma* is made for a *sadhu* of a middle *tirthankara*, it is unacceptable for him, but the other *sadhus* can accept it. However, the first and last *tirthankara's* *sadhus* cannot accept that food.

The commentator explains the reason for this by saying that the *sadhus* of the first *tirthankara* are *rijujada* (straight and rigid). Therefore, they criticize the *akritya* (wrong action) but cannot avoid other similar faults. The rigidity of the householders at that time is that they make food that is forbidden for one person for the sake of others.

The *sadhus* of the 22 middle *tirthankaras* are *rijuprajna* (straight and wise). Because they are straight, they criticize the *akritya* done in solitude with righteousness. Their wisdom lies in the fact that they themselves also prevent faults related to *tajjaatiya bhikṣā* (food received from the same caste). At that time, the householders also do not commit *aarambha-samarambha* (beginning and ending) faults for the *sadhus* and avoid other *tajjaatiya* faults. The disciples of the last *tirthankara* are *vakrajada* (crooked and rigid). Because they are crooked, they do not readily accept *akritya*. And because they are rigid, they continue to consume *adhakarma* and other offenses. Even when the householder performs *adhakarma* with deceit, he says that the food was prepared because of guests or a festival.

**Exceptions to the Acceptance of *Adhakarma***

If the *adhakarma* food becomes *avagrahantaarit* (under the control of Indra), then that food can be considered acceptable. In this context, it is not irrelevant to mention the incident that happened during the time of Lord Rishabha. Once, Lord Rishabha was in *samavasarana* (assembly) with his *sangha* on the Ashtapada mountain. Hearing of Lord Rishabha's arrival, Emperor Bharat also arrived with all his riches to see the Lord.

##  Pinḍaniryukti: An Observation

They took with them 500 carts filled with food for the sake of giving alms. They requested alms from the Lord. The Lord said, "Bharat! Ādhākarma, Abhyāhata, and Rājapinḍa are painful for the āhāra vrata, therefore this āhāra is inconceivable for the sādhus."

Bharat was extremely saddened upon hearing the Lord's words. He began to consider himself unfortunate. At that time, Devendra was also present there. Knowing his sorrow, he asked the Lord about avagraha. The Lord explained the five types of avagraha. Devendra paid homage to the Lord and distributed the sādhuprāyogya āhāra brought in his avagraha. Seeing the benefit, Bharat Chakravarti also became happy. Then Bharat distributed sādhuprāyogya āhāra, etc., throughout India.

The Bṛhatkalpabhāṣya mentions exceptions to the consumption of ādhākarma āhāra. In times of famine, or if an ācārya, upādhyāya, or any bhikṣu is ill, there is a possibility of consuming ādhākarma āhāra. Even if pure āhāra is not found after searching for it three times before entering a dense forest on the way, ādhākarma āhāra can be consumed on the fourth occasion.

One point to consider regarding ādhākarma is that kṛta, auddeshika, and āhṛta are mentioned in many places in the āgamas, but it is surprising that the word ādhākarma is not found anywhere in important texts like the Daśavaikalika, which presents the entire ācāra-saṃhitā of the sādhus. Although there is a prohibition of samaṇṭṭa, i.e., food prepared for the śramaṇa. Why Ācārya Śayyambhava did not use the word ādhākarma is a subject of investigation.

2. Auddeshika

Āhāra prepared collectively for the sake of śramaṇa, māhaṇa, atithi, kṛpaṇa, etc., bhikṣācaras is called auddeshika. According to Mūlācāra, āhāra prepared for the sake of devatā, pāṣaṇḍī, anyadarshi, or kṛpaṇa, etc., is called auddeshika. It is debatable why Vaṭṭaker did not mention śramaṇa in this. The Daśavaikalika sūtra explains this fault through word differentiation. According to it, if a sādhus knows that this āhāra is prepared for donation, for merit, for beggars, or for śramaṇas (five types of śramaṇas), then the sādhus should refrain from that āhāra. There is a mention there that the sādhus who are nityāgra (daily

##  66

Those who accept **piṇḍanīyukti** (invited food), **krīta** (purchased), **auddeshika** (purposeful) and **āhr̥ta** (obtained) food, approve of the killing of living beings. In the **Praśnavyākaraṇa Sūtra**, **auddeshika** food is described as being full of violence and sin. The author has divided **auddeshika** into two categories: **oḍha** and **vibhāga**. 

**Oḍha auddeshika** is when a householder cooks food thinking, "If I don't give anything now, I won't get anything in the next life," and then offers it to other **darśanī** ascetics without any division. 

**How to know oḍha auddeshika:**

Generally, an ascetic can understand from the householder's words and actions that it is **oḍha auddeshika**. According to the **niyuktikāra**, here are some points to identify **oḍha auddeshika**:

* The wife tells her husband that the five **bhikṣācara** (begging monks) have already received their alms for the day.
* The housewife draws lines to count the alms or counts them while giving them.
* The housewife tells her husband or the alms-giver to give alms from the designated portion, not from here.
* When an ascetic enters for alms, she says, "Separate this much alms."
* The housewife's movements, opening and closing of utensils, and her words reveal the **muni**'s desire and non-desire for **auddeshika** alms.

In this context, the **niyuktikāra** gives the example of a **govatṣa** (cowherd).

**Vibhāga auddeshika**

Food cooked after dividing it for **śramaṇa** (ascetics), **brāhmaṇa** (priests), etc., is called **vibhāga auddeshika**. According to **piṇḍanīyukti**, after a wedding or other celebration, setting aside a portion of the remaining cooked food for charity is **vibhāga auddeshika**. There are three types of **vibhāga auddeshika**: **uddiṣṭa**, **kr̥ta**, and **karma**.

**Uddiṣṭa** - Setting aside a portion of the food prepared for the householder for the **bhikṣācara** is called **uddiṣṭa auddeshika**.

**Kr̥ta** - Mixing curd and rice from the leftover **śālyodana** (rice cooked with ghee) and offering it in the form of **karamba** (a type of sweet) for alms is called **kr̥ta auddeshika**.

Page #81:
---------------------------
**Pinḍaniyukti:** A karma-vivah (ceremony) where the leftover modaka (sweetmeat) is ground into powder and given to the bhikṣācara (mendicants) is called karma. The difference between ādhākarma and karma auddeshika is that ādhākarma is made for the sadhu (saint) from the beginning, while karma auddeshika is when a householder adds something to or refines their own food.

There are four sub-categories of each of these three: 1. Uddesa 2. Samuddesa 3. Ādesa 4. Samādesa. Uddesa - food made for all bhikṣācara, anyadarśanī (those who see others) and śramaṇa (ascetics). Samuddesa - food made for all pākhaṇḍī (hypocritical) anyadarśanī sadhus. Ādesa - food made for śramaṇa. Samādesa - food made for nirgrantha (those who have renounced everything).

When uddishta, kṛta and karma are multiplied by the above four categories, there are 12 categories. The niyuktikāra (author) has also made sub-categories of these 12 categories. Uddishta auddeshika etc. are of two types, each chhinna (regular) and achhinna (irregular). Chhinna means regular and achhinna means irregular. Then there are four categories of each, based on dravya (substance), kṣetra (field), kāla (time) and bhāva (feeling). Thus, there are eight categories of each. Multiplying 12 categories by 8 gives 96 categories of auddeshika dosha.

According to the Sūtrakṛtāṅga, there is a possibility of jīvavada (killing of living beings) by accepting auddeshika bhikṣā (alms), therefore it is considered aneshanīya (not to be accepted). 3. Pūtikarma Dosha

Pūti means foul-smelling or impure. There are two categories of this: dravya pūti and bhāva pūti. The combination of a fragrant or pure substance with an impure substance is dravya pūti. Here, the author has alluded to the story of the Chagaṇadharmic. The mixture of even a small amount of the elements of the divisions of ādhākarma etc. udgama dosha in pure food is bhāva pūti. Bhāva pūti also makes the muni's niratichara (non-transgressive) character impure. Just as one

## Pindaniyukti

If even a particle comes into contact, that substance becomes unacceptable. Similarly, even a small portion of *Ahadkarma* renders the entire food impure. Acharya Haribhadra considered mixed food contaminated with the element of potential *Ahadkarma* as *Pootikarma* dosha.  *Pooti* does not occur merely by contact with *Ahadkarma*, but food contaminated with *Pooti* is also considered to have *Pooti* dosha.

In *Moolaachar*, five types of *Pooti* are specified: 1. *Chulli* (fireplace), 2. *Ukka* (mortar), 3. *Darvi* (doorway), 4. *Bhajan* (vessel), 5. *Gandha* (smell). In *Anngardharmaamrit*, two types of *Pooti* dosha are found: *Aaprasookamishra* and *Kalpit*. *Aaprasookamishra Pootikarma* is the name given to *Prasook* substance mixed with *Aaprasook* substance. The second *Pooti* dosha, called *Kalpit*, is when the food is not used until it is given to the *Sadhu*. There is a significant difference between *Aaprasook* and *Ahadkarma*. *Aaprasook* means *Achit* (unacceptable), while *Ahadkarma* means food made *Achit* for the sake of the *Sadhu*. The various types of *Pooti* dosha can be presented in the following chart:

**Pooti**
**Dravya** (Substance)
**Sookshma** (Subtle)
**Upakaranavishayak** (Related to utensils)
**Bhaktapanavishayak** (Related to food and drink)
**Indhan** (Fuel)
**Dhoom** (Smoke)
**Vaashp** (Vapor)
**Agnikan** (Fire particle)
**Nishith** (Night)

According to *Bhaashya*, the types of *Badarpooti* are as follows:

**Badarpooti**
**Aahar** (Food)
**Upadhi** (Cause)
**Vasati** (Residence)
**Upakaranpooti** (Utensil contamination)
**Aaharpooti** (Food contamination)
**Vastra** (Clothing)
**Paatra** (Vessel)
**Moolgun** (Primary quality)
**Uttargun** (Secondary quality)

*Nishith Bhaashya* has classified seven types each of *Moolgun* and *Uttargun*. In house construction, the use of two *Veli* (creepers), two *Dharana* (supports), and one *Prishthavansh* (back support) are related to *Moolgun*.  The seven things related to *Uttargun* are: bamboo, *Kadan-Okampan* (construction materials), roof construction, plastering, door installation, and earthwork. If six of these are *Prasook* and one is *Ahadkarma*, then *Pooti* dosha occurs.

## Pinḍaniyukti: An Observation

**Equipment Pollution (Upakaraṇapūti)**

Equipment is referred to as that which is helpful, such as a stove for cooking food and a spoon for serving food. A stove mixed with Ādhākarmic dust and a plate and spoon touched by Ādhākarmic food are examples of equipment pollution.

**Food Pollution (Āhārapūti)**

If an Ādhākarmic spoon is removed from a plate, the food on the plate is considered pure. However, if even pure food is served with an Ādhākarmic spoon, it becomes Āhārapūti. Similarly, even if a cook is not Ādhākarmic, if they stir Ādhākarmic food and then serve pure food, that pure food is also considered Āhārapūti.

**Drink Pollution (Bhaktapānapūti)**

Mixing Ādhākarmic vegetables, salt, asafoetida, mustard seeds, and cumin seeds in pure buttermilk, or adding spices to it, is Bhaktapānapūti. If a vessel in which Ādhākarmic food was previously cooked is not cleaned thoroughly three times (Kalpātra), and food is cooked or placed in it, it is considered Bhaktapānapūti. Another interpretation of Kalpātra is that after cooking food in the vessel three times and removing it, the food cooked for the fourth time is pure. The smoke that arises from putting gram flour, asafoetida, and cumin seeds on smokeless embers pollutes the plate and buttermilk, etc., which is included in equipment pollution.

**Subtle Pollution (Sūkṣmapūti)**

Subtle pollution arises from fuel, fire particles, smoke, and vapor. The elements of smoke, smell, etc., are present everywhere, so it is not possible to avoid them. In the context of subtle pollution, the author raises a question: How is it possible to avoid subtle pollution when sometimes even after washing a vessel three times, its smell does not go away? In response, the author of the Niyukti says that just as a substance is not considered contaminated or discarded when it is touched by the smell of impurity coming from a distance, similarly, the character is not corrupted by the touch of the particles of smell associated with Ādhākarma. Ācārya Malayagiri clarifies this by saying that smell is subtle pollution. It is only to be understood, it cannot be avoided because the atoms of smell are present throughout the universe.

## Pindaniryukti

On the day a householder completes the half-day meal (Aadakarma), the food is tainted by the Aadakarma dosha. This taint remains in the house for the next three days. During these three days, a Muni cannot accept alms from that house. If the vessel is tainted by the Pooti dosha, the food placed or cooked in it after three Kalpas can be accepted.

## Pootikarma

The Sutra Kritanga describes the harm of consuming food tainted by Pootikarma. Even if a monk accepts such food after traveling a thousand houses, he acts like a householder despite being a renunciate. Just as fish washed ashore by the tide, trapped in the sand, experience immense suffering when their flesh is pecked by carnivorous birds like Dhak and Kank, similarly, monks who indulge in the present pleasure of consuming Pootikarma-tainted food, experience endless suffering like those fish.

According to Nishaith Churnikar, if a monk accepts food, clothing, or shelter tainted by Pooti dosha, it leads to the violation of restraint (Samyama-viraadhana). The impure acceptance can deceive the deity and cause indigestion or other illnesses as a form of self-violation.

## Mishrajat

Food cooked for a householder, a hypocrite, a deceitful alms-seeker, or a monk, is tainted by Mishrajat dosha. It is of three types:

* **Yavadarthic Mishrajat:** Food cooked for a householder and all alms-seekers.
* **Pakhandi Mishrajat:** Food cooked for a householder and a deceitful monk.
* **Sadhu Mishrajat:** Food cooked for a family and a Nirgranth.

The Niruktikars clearly state that just as a person dies from consuming a thousand-pronged poison, similarly, even if a thousand people have touched the three types of Mishrajat food, it is not acceptable for a monk. It destroys the monk's character.

## Pindianuyukti: An Observation

**71**

Explaining the process of purification, the author states that after consuming mixed food, one should completely remove it from the vessel with a finger or clean the vessel with dry cow dung, then wash the vessel three times. After that, the vessel should be dried in the sun and then pure food should be consumed in it. Some Acharyas believe that after washing the vessel for the fourth time, food can be consumed without drying the vessel, and there is no fault in it.

**5.  Establishment Fault**

Separating food for a Sadhu and keeping it aside is an establishment fault. According to Mulachar, taking food from a cooking vessel and placing it in another vessel, either in one's own house or in another house, is an establishment fault. According to the commentator, a Muni who consumes food from an establishment fault is considered to be in a state of Parvasta. A Muni who consumes food with an establishment fault, considering it to be faultless, and does not criticize or repent for it, does not become an Aradhak after attaining Kaladharma.

Establishment occurs in two ways: 1. Swasthana Establishment, 2. Parastthana Establishment. Placing an object on the stove is a Swasthana establishment fault, and placing it on a sneeze, etc., is a Parastthana establishment fault. Both of these have two sub-categories:

* Swasthana Anantar Establishment and Swasthana Parampar Establishment.
* Parastthana Anantar Establishment and Parastthana Parampar Establishment.

Substances like ghee and jaggery, which are not susceptible to any change, and whose form is not altered by the doer, are called Anantar Established substances. Milk, sugarcane juice, etc., which can be transformed into curd, butter, ghee, and jaggery, etc., are called Parampar Established substances. Keeping these for a long time makes them foul-smelling and putrid.

The author of the Niyukti has explained the establishment fault based on time with an example. A Sadhu requested milk from a housewife. At that time, she said, "I will give you alms after some time." The Sadhu received milk from another place. When the housewife requested the Sadhu to take the milk, the Muni said, "I have already received milk, I will take it when I need it again." Fearing the Sadhu's debt, the woman did not use the milk. She thought, "Tomorrow I will make curd from this milk and give it to the Muni." Thinking this, she established it for the Muni. The next day, the Muni did not take the curd. The woman made butter and 1. Pini 125, Mavri P. 89.

Page #86:
---------------------------
## 72

The curd was made into a lump (पिंडनियुक्ति) and the butter was converted into ghee. If the housewife does not use that ghee for the family, then that established ghee may be afflicted with the establishment fault (स्थापना दोष) up to the "देशोनपूर्वकोटि". In the Jītakalpabhāṣya, this is considered a permanent fault (चिरस्थापित दोष).

Explaining the establishment fault in another way, the नियुक्तिकार says that someone comes with alms in hand to give to a monk from three houses situated in the same row. At that time, one monk accepts the alms properly (सम्यक् उपयोगपूर्वक), and the other monk stands between the two houses and uses the alms for things like अनेषणीयता. In this way, after three houses, that food becomes afflicted with the establishment fault (स्थापना दोष). In the Jītakalpabhāṣya, this is included under the category of "त्वरिक स्थापना दोष". In the पिण्डविशुद्धिप्रकरण, this is explained under the category of "अभ्याहत दोष".

**6. प्राभृतिका दोष**

To give a desired object as a gift to one's beloved or revered person with respect is called प्राभृत. Giving such food as a gift to a monk is called प्राभृतिका दोष. In the Bṛhatkalpabhāṣya, प्राभृतिका and प्रहेणक are considered synonymous. This is of two types: 1. सूक्ष्म प्राभृतिका 2. बादर प्राभृतिका. These also have two sub-types each: 1. अवष्वष्कण (उत्सर्पण) and 2. उत्ष्वष्कण (अवसर्पण).

**बादर अवष्वष्कण प्राभृतिका:** Getting married before the determined time when the monk's arrival is known, so that alms can be given to the monk, is the बादर अवष्वष्कण or बादर अवसर्पण प्राभृतिका दोष.

**सूक्ष्म अवष्वष्कण प्राभृतिका:** The mother told the child, "I am busy spinning cotton etc. right now, so I will give you food later." In the meantime, the monk arrived, so feeding the child first along with the monk is the सूक्ष्म अवष्वष्कण or सूक्ष्म अवसर्पण प्राभृतिका.

## Pinḍaniryukti: An Observation

**73**

**Bādar Utshvashkaṇ Prābhṛtika:**  Delaying the date of a son's or daughter's wedding, etc., for the purpose of feeding the Sadhus, is called Bādar Utshvashkaṇ Prābhṛtika.

**Sūkṣma Utshvashkaṇ Prābhṛtika:**  If a mother, busy with work, tells her child to wait a little while when it is time for food, saying that the Muni will come home soon and she will feed him then, this is the fault of Sūkṣma Utshvashkaṇ or Sūkṣma Utsarpana Prābhṛtika.

Āchārya Batṭar, considering the increase and decrease of time, has described giving food after the day, fortnight, month, year, etc., as Bādar Prābhṛtika, and giving food intended for the morning in the afternoon or midday as the fault of Sūkṣma Prābhṛtika. The commentator of Mūlāchāra has mentioned the fault of Prābhṛtika as a Prāvartita fault.

According to the Niruktakāra, a Muni who accepts food with the fault of Prābhṛtika and does not perform Pratikramṇa of that place, wanders in the world in vain, like a bald Muni or a pigeon with lost wings.

In Anagāradharmāmṛta, the term Prābhṛtak is used instead of Prābhṛtika. According to Digambara Āchārya Vasunandi, accepting alms with the fault of Prāvartita leads to afflictions, many obstacles, and the faults of Ārambh-hiṃsā, etc.

In Pinḍaniryukti, the fault of Prābhṛtika is related to food, but in Bṛhatkalpabhāṣya, Prābhṛtika is also related to the place of residence.

**Bādar Prābhṛtika**

There are five types of Bādar Prābhṛtika: 1. Vidhvamsana 2. Chādana 3. Lepana 4. Bhūmikarma 5. Pratītyakaraṇa.

These five types are of two kinds: 1. Avashvashkaṇ 2. Abhishvashkaṇ.

In Avashvashkaṇ, Vidhvamsana, etc., are done before the time fixed for the Sadhu. In Abhishvashkaṇ, they are done after the fixed time. All these types are also divided into two parts: 1. Deshatah 2. Sarvatah.

Performing Bādar Prābhṛtika related to residence results in four Laghu (Ayambil) Prāyaśchitta. Performing it Deshatah results in Māsalghu (Purimārḍha) Prāyaśchitta, and performing it Sarvatah results in Bhinnamās Prāyaśchitta.

**Sūkṣma Prābhṛtika**

Sūkṣma Prābhṛtika related to residence is also of five types:

1. Pini 135.
2. Pini 132, 133.
3. Mūla 433.
4. Mūlāṭī p. 340.
5. Pini 136.

7. For the details of all these, see Bṛbhā 1675-1680, Ṭī p. 493, 494.

##  Chapter 14: Pindaniyukti

**1. Sammarjan:** Sweeping.
**2. Avarshan:** Cooling a place with water.
**3. Uplepan:** Applying cow dung.
**4. Sukshma-pushpa-rachana:** Creating a subtle flower arrangement.
**5. Deepak:** Lighting a lamp.

These also have two divisions: **Avashvashkan** and **Abhisvashkan**. For example, if a householder thinks, "I will sweep before the time for the study group arrives," and sweeps, this is a subtle **Sammarjan** **Avashvashkan** **Prabhriti** fault. If he thinks, "The study group is sitting now, I will sweep when they get up," then this is a subtle **Sammarjan** **Abhisvashkan** **Prabhriti**. The author has further divided this into many sub-categories.

**7. Pradushkaran Fault:**

Giving food by illuminating a dark place or bringing it out of darkness into light is a **Pradushkaran** fault. The Dashavaikalik Sutra mentions that a monk should not accept alms from a place with a low doorway or a dark room where the object or creature is not visible due to darkness. There are two divisions of **Pradushkaran** fault:

**1. Prakatcharan:** Removing the object to be given from darkness and placing it in a light place.
**2. Prakashkaran:** Making a hole in the wall, widening the doorway, creating another doorway, removing the roof of the house, or illuminating the object to be given with a gem, lamp, or fire to illuminate a dark place.

Explaining the **Prakatcharan** fault, the **Niyuktikar** says that there are three types of hearths:

**1. Sancharimā:** A portable hearth.
**2. Sadhu ke liye pahle se hi bahar banai hui chulhi:** A hearth already built outside for the monk.
**3. Sadhu ke liye sadya bahar prakash mein banaya gaya chulha:** A hearth built outside in the light for the monk.

Eating food cooked on all three types of hearths results in two faults: **Upakaranaputi** and **Pradushkaran**.

**1. For expansion, see Bribha 1681-86, T. p. 495, 496.**

**4. Pini 138/1.**

**6. A hearth that can be taken outside for a purpose even though it is inside the house (Mavri P. 94).**

Page #89:
---------------------------
## Pindaniyukti: An Observation

The term "transition" has been used in place of "manifestation" in the Mulachara. The meaning is the same as that of "manifestation". In "illumination", the commentator has given the meaning as polishing vessels with ashes etc. and spreading the vessels out.

The author, while explaining the exceptions to both these faults, says that if a householder brings out food in the light and says that there are many flies inside the house and it is also very hot, there is light outside and no flies, therefore we have brought food out for ourselves or cooked it outside. In this way, by making it self-intended, that food becomes blameless and is therefore acceptable to the monk. However, if the light of a lamp or a torch is used for self-intended purposes, i.e., for the householder's own use, then that food is not acceptable to the monk. If, for some reason, food contaminated with the fault of contamination is consumed, the monk can consume pure food in that vessel without washing it. According to Acharya Vasunandi, food contaminated with the fault of contamination is prohibited due to the lack of purity of the path of eating.

**8. Kritakrit Fault**

For a monk, buying and giving alms is a Kritadosa. Acharya Haribhadra, while clarifying this, has said that whatever is bought for a monk is Krit, and what is made from the purchased item is called Kritakrit. Wherever the mention of "purpose" is found in the Agamas like Acharachula, Sutrakritanga, Stananga, Bhagavati, Dasha Vaikalik etc., there is also a mention of Kritakrit and Abhihit etc. faults.

According to the Brihatkalpa Bhashya, the Kritakrit fault is of two types - specified and unspecified. Where the householder buys with the instruction that such and such clothes, vessels etc. will be for me and such and such for the monk, there is specified Krit. Conversely, what is bought spontaneously is called unspecified Krit. In unspecified Krit, the remaining clothes etc. are acceptable to the monk after being used by the householder, but specified Krit is unacceptable to the monk. In specified Krit, if the householder tells the monk that you accept the clothes bought for me, I will use the clothes bought for you, then the monk can take the specified clothes for that householder. In Pindaniyukti, four types of Kritakrit fault have been explained.

1. Mulaati p. 341; Prakashanam bhajanadinaam bhasmaadinod- 4. Dashahati p. 116; Krayanam-kritam....sadhvadinimittamiti kadina va nirmarjanam bhajanaderva vistaranam.

---------------------------
##  Translation:

**Pindaniyukti**

**Atmadravyakrit**

Receiving food by giving the householder offerings from pilgrimages, fragrant substances, transformative pills, sandalwood, and pieces of cloth, etc., for good fortune is called Atmadravyakrit. Here, the cause is treated in the action, and Atmadravyakrit is accepted.

The author, while pointing out the faults of Atmadravyakrit, says that if someone becomes ill due to giving offerings, etc., then that person may criticize the sermon or the monk, saying that I became ill due to their influence. If he becomes healthy due to the offerings, etc., then he flatters the monk in front of everyone, saying that I became healthy due to their influence. If, upon hearing his praise, other people request offerings, etc., and they are not given to all, then there is a possibility of conflict and dispute.

**Atmabhavakrit**

Receiving alms based on religious stories, debates, austerities, astrology, heat treatment, Shruasthan (position of Acharya), caste, family, group, karma, and skills, etc., is called Atmabhavakrit. The author has tried to express human weakness in a very psychological way in Atmabhavakrit. If a monk tells religious stories to obtain food, then the listeners willingly provide him with whatever he needs. The author, while explaining another option, says that if a monk looks like a famous story teller, and people ask him if he is the famous religious story teller, then he says, for the sake of greed for food, etc., that all monks are religious story tellers, or if he remains silent at that time, then the devotees think that he is the famous religious story teller, and he is not revealing himself due to seriousness. Thus, obtaining wealth by impressing with one's skills is also Atmabhavakrit.

If the monk does all these things for the reduction of suffering or karma, then there is great Nirjara. If he uses religious stories, etc., for the sake of a common need like receiving alms, then the fruit of Nirjara is reduced.

**Paradravyakrit**

Receiving food bought by the householder for the monk is called Paradravyakrit.

**Parabhavakrit**

Displaying or telling religious stories through a puppet, etc., to attract the monk, is called Parabhavakrit.

## Pinḍaniryukti: An Observation

**Giving food etc. to a person who is parava-krita (influenced by the object of desire) is considered a fault. There are three faults in accepting parava-krita - krita, abhihr̥ta and sthāpita. The author has also mentioned the story of a monk named Devasharma to explain this fault.**

**According to Bhagavati, a muni who considers krita-krita food as flawless, consumes it considering it flawless, and presents it as flawless in the assembly, is a viradhaka if he does not criticize that place.**

**9. Prāmitya (Apamitya) Fault**

**The ninth fault of udgama is prāmitya. Giving food etc. to a sadhu by borrowing from someone is the prāmitya fault. The commentator Malayagiri has given the Sanskrit shade of 'pāmiccha' as apamitya.**

**Chanakya has called the acceptance of grains etc. with the promise of returning them as apamitya. Therefore, the Sanskrit shade of apamitya given by the commentator Malayagiri is also consistent here. In Digambara literature, there is a mention of ṛṇadosha for the prāmitya fault.**

**This is of two types - with increase (with interest) and without increase. The meaning is that when the giver brings rice etc. saying that I will give you more back from this, then it is a fault with increase. When he brings it with the instruction that I will give you this much food later, it is a fault without increase.**

**According to the author, the prāmitya fault is of two types - laukika and lokoत्तर. Laukika prāmitya**

**If a family member like a sister borrows from someone and gives it to the sadhu, then it is the laukika prāmitya fault. To reveal this fault, the author has mentioned the story of Bhagini Sammati, who borrowed oil for her brother sadhu and gave it as a donation. Due to the unlimited debt, she had to accept slavery. Later, the initiated brother explained to the Seth and Bhagini Sammati also took initiation.**

**Lokoत्तर prāmitya**

**Giving each other loans among sadhus is lokoत्तर prāmitya. Lokoत्तर prāmitya is of two types. Firstly, a muni may accept clothes for some time. Secondly, give it on loan in such a way that the same clothes will be returned after so many days. In the first type, if the clothes become dirty, torn, etc.,**

If the allotted cloth becomes worn out, is stolen, or is lost, there is a possibility of conflict. Similarly, if a monk who is difficult to please is given a better or a special cloth in exchange for a loan, he may cause conflict. The author says that if a monk needs cloth and another monk wants to give cloth, etc., then give the cloth without any apprehension. If a cunning or lazy monk needs to be given cloth, then he should not be given the cloth directly. The cloth should be given through the Guru, so that there is no conflict later. 10. Parivartita Dosha
Giving food, etc., to a monk by exchanging it with a neighbor or someone else is Parivartita Dosha. Parivartita Dosha is also of two types - Laukika and Lokottara. Both have two sub-categories each - 1. Taddravya Vishayaka 2. Anyadravya Vishayaka.
Giving fragrant ghee in exchange for cooked ghee to a monk is Laukika Taddravya Paravarta, and giving Kodrava grain in exchange for Shalyodana, etc., is Laukika Anyadravya Paravarta Dosha. The Niyuktikara has mentioned the story of Lakshmi, a woman, who gave Shalyodana in exchange for Kodrava grain when her brother, Kshemankar, a monk, came to visit. This led to conflict between the two families.
A monk exchanging cloth, etc., with another monk is Lokottara Paravarta. Giving cloth and taking cloth in return by a monk is Lokottara Taddravya Parivartita Dosha, and giving cloth and taking a book in return is Lokottara Anyadravya Paravarta.
While explaining the faults of Lokottara Paravarta, the Niyuktikara says that the monk who receives the cloth, etc., may say that this cloth is inferior, my cloth was bigger, and this cloth is worn out, rough to touch, made of thick thread, torn, stained, unable to protect from cold, and faded, my cloth was not like this. Similarly, a monk may be misled by the words of a cunning monk. Therefore, if a monk has a certified cloth and another monk does not, then the exchange should be done in front of the Guru, so that there is no possibility of conflict later. 11. Abhyahrita Dosha
Bringing food, etc., from another place for a monk is Abhyahrita Dosha. This is called Ahut and

## Pindaniyukti: An Observation

**Abhyahita Dosha** (also known as Abhyahita Dosha) is of two types: **Aachirna** and **Anaachirna**. The **Chhedasutras** mention that if a **Gaathapati** brings food for a **Sadhu** from beyond three houses, the monk who accepts it is liable for **Prayaschitta** (penance). The **Dashavaikalik Sutra** accepts the approval of killing in **Abhyahita Aahar**. The **Agamas** prohibit the acceptance of **Abhyahita Dosha**-affected alms in many places.

**Anaachirna Abhyahita** has two sub-categories: **Nishith Anaachirna Abhyahrita** and **Nonishith Anaachirna Abhyahrita**. **Nishith** means where the giver does not reveal their intention, and **Nonishith** means where the giver clearly states the purpose of their arrival. The commentary on **Pravachnasaroddhar** classifies the types of **Abhyahrita** as follows:

| **Aachirna** | **Anaachirna** | **Desha** | **Deshadesha** | **Deshadesha** | **Nishith** | **Nishith** | **Nonishith** | **Nonishith** |

## 80. Pindiya-niyukti

**Nishith Swagram Abhyahrit**

The village where the sadhus reside is called Swagram, and the rest are called Paragram. The Niyuktikar explains Nishith Swagram Abhyahrit by saying that a Shravika goes to the Upashray with food to donate. So that the Muni does not have any apprehension, she tells the Muni in front of him, "Bhagavan! I received this sweet while going to such and such house, or I got this material in such and such Jimanwar. I have come to pay my respects to the Sadhus naturally," and then she pays her respects to the Muni, gives the alms, and returns.

Or, she hides her original thoughts in front of the Muni and says, "I brought this sweet from home to give to my family members, but they didn't take it," or she deceitfully says in a loud voice in the house of the Shayataris, "Take this Prahenak." The Shayataris deceitfully refuse. When there is an artificial quarrel between the two, the Muni gives her the Prahenak as alms. This is Nishith Swagram Abhyahrit.

**No-Nishith Swagram Abhyahrit**

The Granthakar has mentioned many reasons for No-Nishith Swagram Abhyahrit:

* The Muni went for alms, but the alms-giver was not at home or was sleeping.
* It was not the time for alms.
* Food prepared for specific individuals was not given first.
* After the alms-seeking Sadhu left, festival sweets arrived from another house.

Due to all these reasons, the Shravika later goes to the Sadhu's Upashray with alms from her home. This is No-Nishith Swagram Abhyahrit.

**Nishith Paragram Abhyahrit**

The Niyuktikar has explained Nishith Paragram Abhyahrit in detail through a story. After the marriage of Seth Dhanavah, many Modaks were left over. He thought that if he gave alms to the Sadhus, it would be beneficial. The Sadhus could not come from the nearby village yet because there was a river in between. Therefore, it would be good if he went to the nearby village to give alms to the Sadhus. There, the Shravak, thinking that the Sadhus would not accept these Modaks due to the fear of Adhakarma, thought that he should first give alms to the Brahmanas. He sat in the middle of the Uccar-Sthandila land of the Sadhus and Sadhvis. Then, upon request, the Muni accepted the Modaks.

Page #95:
---------------------------
## Pinḍaniyukti: An Observation

This is an observation on the acceptance of modakas as prasūka. It is stated in the Nishītha paragram that modakas are prasūka. The Nishītha paragram should be understood in the same way as the Nishītha svagram. The niyuktikāra and the tīkākara have not explained it separately. 

There are two types of ācīrṇa svagram abhyāhr̥ta based on the area: deśa and deśadeśa. An area within a hundred hands is called deśa, and an area beyond a hundred hands is called deśadeśa. In this, food brought from within a hundred hands is ācīrṇa for the sādhus, and food brought from beyond that distance is anācīrṇa. 

There are three types of ācīrṇa abhyāhr̥ta: jaghanya, madhyama, and utkr̥ṣṭa. Transferring an object from one hand to another is jaghanya ācīrṇa, abhyāhr̥ta from within a hundred hands is utkr̥ṣṭa ācīrṇa, and abhyāhr̥ta from the area between these two is madhyama ācīrṇa.

The niyuktikāra has mentioned the faults of abhyāhr̥ta from jalapath and sthalapaṭh. According to him, both these paths lead to samyama-virādha and ātma-virādha. The faults of the jalapath are: immersion in deep water, being caught by aquatic animals, and sinking of the feet due to mud, etc. The faults of the sthalapaṭh are: thorns, snakes, thieves, dogs, etc.

In the tīkā of Mūlācāra, the Sanskrit shadow of 'abhihaḍ' is 'abhighaṭ', and it is divided into two parts: deśa abhighaṭ and sarva abhighaṭ. Deśa abhighaṭ is of two types: ācīrṇa and anācīrṇa. According to the Digambara tradition, alms brought from three houses or seven houses are ācīrṇa, and alms brought from beyond that distance are anācīrṇa. There are four types of sarva abhighaṭ: 1. svagram 2. paragram 3. svadesa 4. paradesa. Taking from the east side of the neighborhood to the west side of the neighborhood is svagram abhighaṭ. Bringing from another village is paragram abhighaṭ. Similarly, svadesa and paradesa should be understood. All types of sarvābhighaṭ are anācīrṇa.

In svagram abhyāhr̥ta, food brought from within three houses is called svagram gṛhantar. Nogṛhantar is of many types: vāṭaka, gali, etc. In this, the one who brings it cannot use it, therefore it is anācīrṇa. 

12. Udbhinna Doṣa

Opening a covered or sealed container with lac, etc., and giving medicines, ghee, sugar, etc., to the sādhus is...

Page #96:
---------------------------
##  82. Giving food by opening a sealed container is a type of Udbhinna Dosha.

Udbhinna Dosha is of two types: Pihithoudbhinna and Kapatoadbhinna. Giving ghee or oil to a Sadhu by opening a seal, whether it is a conscious or unconscious act, is Pihithoudbhinna Dosha. Giving alms by opening a closed door is Kapatoadbhinna Dosha.

If a container of oil is opened for a Sadhu, giving it to a son or engaging in buying and selling with it is a sinful act. If the householder forgets to close the container, ants, mice, or other creatures may fall into it and be killed. Opening and closing seals or coverings causes violence to the elements of earth, water, fire, and air.

Kapatoadbhinna Dosha can lead to the following:

1.  Dirt, water, and plants near the door can be trampled upon.
2.  If water spills, it can harm the fire element of the nearby stove.
3.  The movement of the door can harm small creatures like lizards, centipedes, and ants.
4.  Opening the door can injure a child sitting behind it.

If a door without a latch is opened daily and does not scrape against the ground, a Sadhu can receive alms through it. Similarly, if the mouth of a pot or container is opened daily or covered with cloth, not sealed with wax or other materials, it is acceptable to give alms through it.

## 13. Malaprahrit Dosha

This is the thirteenth type of Udgma Dosha. Bringing food to a Sadhu from a higher floor or a basement, or giving it to them after sneezing, is Malaprahrit Dosha. In Digambar literature, the terms Malarohan and Aroha are used instead of Malaprahrit. A Muni who accepts Malaprahrit food is subject to atonement.

Malaprahrit Dosha is mainly of two types: Jghanya Malaprahrit and Utkrishta Malaprahrit. Giving alms while standing on the balls of one's feet or on a platform, stool, or other raised surface is Jghanya Malaprahrit.

Page #97:
---------------------------
## 83. Pinḍaniyukti: A Supervisory Flaw

Pinḍaniyukti is a supervisory flaw. Offering alms by climbing up to a platform, such as a Niḥśreṇī, and then descending from the upper part of the prāsāda is considered an excellent example of Mālapāhata. The Niyuktikāra has given the example of a Bhiksu in the case of a heinous Mālapāhata and a Kapālika in the case of an excellent Mālapāhata.

There are also three types of Mālapāhata flaws, according to different interpretations: 1. Ūrdhva, 2. Adhaḥ, 3. Tiर्यक्. Offering alms by descending from above, such as by sneezing, is Ūrdhva Mālapāhata. Offering alms by bringing it from below, such as from a basement, is Adhaḥ Mālapāhata. Offering alms from a very high place, such as a large pot, is Tiर्यक् Mālapāhata. According to the Bhāṣyakāra, offering food kept in an Ardha-māle is Tiर्यक् Mālapāhata.

The Piṇḍaviśuddhiprakaraṇa mentions four types of Mālapāhata flaws. In addition to the three mentioned above, the fourth is Ubhaya Mālapāhata. Explaining Ubhaya, its commentator Yaśodevasūri says that offering food to a sādhū by raising one's heel and extending one's arm while standing on a large pot, a camel's back, or a high platform is Ubhaya Mālapāhata. In this case, the body is moving in both upward and downward directions, hence the name Ubhaya Mālapāhata.

If the householder is already standing on a platform, a step, or a staircase before the sādhū arrives, then he can offer the pātra-dāna by extending his hand, as this is not considered Anuccotkṣipta.

Yaśodevasūri has raised an argument regarding the Mālapāhata flaw: If offering alms by descending from above is a Mālapāhata flaw, then how is offering alms by bringing it from below a Mālapāhata flaw? In response, he says that food brought from the basement is also considered Mālapāhata due to the nature of the action. This has become a convention in the Āgama, therefore using the term Mālapāhata for bringing food from below is not incorrect.

While explaining the Mālapāhata flaw, the Niyuktikāra says that offering alms by climbing up to a Niḥśreṇī, a platform, etc., can cause the donor to lose balance and fall, resulting in injuries to his hands and feet. If there are sharp objects like Brihidalanaka instruments lying around, it could even lead to death. If the donor is a pregnant woman, there is a possibility of harming two living beings. Falling down could also result in the killing of earth-dwelling beings and other living beings under her body. Due to animosity towards the muni, there could be obstacles in obtaining wealth, the effectiveness of the sermon could be diminished, and people might develop the misconception that these munis are unaware of future calamities.

## 14. Acchhedya Dosha

Taking something from its owner against their will and giving it to a sadhu is Acchhedya Dosha. The Mulachar explains it slightly differently. According to it, giving food to a sadhu out of fear of the king, thieves, etc., after witnessing the muni's begging efforts is Acchhedya Dosha. Its commentator clarifies that it is Acchhedya Dosha when the king and thieves instill fear in the householder's mind, saying that if they don't give food to the muni, the king will take away their wealth or banish them from the kingdom, and thus force them to donate. Acchhedya Dosha is of three types:

* **Prabhuvishayak:** When a householder forcibly takes something from their son, daughter, servant, cowherd, etc., and gives it to a sadhu, it is Prabhuvishayak Acchhedya Dosha.
* **Swamivishaya:** When a village head forcibly takes something from a householder, etc., and gives it to a sadhu, it is Swamivishaya Acchhedya Dosha.
* **Stenavishaya:** When a thief takes something from a merchant and gives it to a sadhu, it is Stenavishaya Acchhedya Dosha.

All three types of Acchhedya food are unacceptable for a sadhu.

Taking Acchhedya food can lead to displeasure and conflict, as illustrated in the story of the cowherd mentioned by the Niruktikar, where the cowherd developed animosity towards the muni. The muni becomes the cause of the binding of antaray karma for the person from whom the food, etc., is taken, and the muni also incurs the Adattadan Dosha. Due to animosity, the bhaktapan for one or many sadhus may be severed. Additionally, expulsion from the upashraya and other hardships may also be experienced.

The author mentions an exception, stating that if the poor person or the owner allows the bhaktapan to be given, then the muni can take that Acchhedya food.

**Pind**

The context of Stenavishaya Acchhedya often arises in the presence of munis traveling with merchants. Generally, a sadhu should not accept Stenacchhedya, but if the thieves forcibly give it, and the merchant says that this is a fortunate opportunity for them to donate to the muni, then the muni:

1. (a) Mavr P. 35; Acchhidyate - Whatever is taken unwillingly from a servant, son, etc., for the purpose of giving it to a sadhu, is Acchhedya.
(b) Pimpr 50; Acchidiya annesim, balavi jam denthi
Samiphahu tena tam acchhejjam.

## Pindaniyukti: A Consideration

A monk may accept food under the following circumstances: if, after thieves have left, the monk returns the food to the owner, saying, "We accepted this food out of fear of the thieves. Now, please accept this back." If the owner happily agrees, the monk may then accept the food. 

This is an example of **Anisrusht Dosha** (a transgression). 

**Anisrusht Dosha** is when something is given by a master (owner) and is considered **Nisrushta** (released). If there are multiple owners, or if food is accepted without the permission of the owner, it is considered **Anisrusht Dosha**. Food obtained through **Anisrusht Dosha** is prohibited by the Tirthankaras. 

The **Dashavaikalik Sutra** clearly states that if two owners are entitled to enjoy a particular food, and one of them invites the monk, the monk should not accept the offered food. 

The **Churnikar** explains this by saying that even if one owner gives permission, the monk should try to understand the intentions of the other owner through their expressions, gestures, and facial expressions. If the other owner seems agreeable, the monk may accept the food even without their explicit permission. 

Generally, there are two types of **Anisrusht Dosha**:

1. **Sadharan Anisrusht** (General Anisrusht)
2. **Cholluk Anisrusht** (Food-related Anisrusht)

The **Jitkalpabhashya** and **Pindavishuddhiprakaran** further divide **Anisrusht Dosha** into three types:

1. **Sadharan Anisrusht** (General Anisrusht)
2. **Cholluk Anisrusht** (Food-related Anisrusht)
3. **Jadd-Hasti Anisrusht** (Jadd-Hasti Anisrusht)

**Pindaniyukti** includes **Jadd-Hasti Anisrusht** under **Cholluk Anisrusht**.

**Sadharan Anisrusht**

**Sadharan Anisrusht** includes things like sweets, milk, oil presses, weddings, shops, and houses. There may be multiple owners of the items found in these places, so a monk should not accept them without the permission of the owner. The author explains **Sadharan Anisrusht** related to sweets through the story of Mani Bhadra and 32 other young men.

If a householder monk accepts **Sadharan Anisrusht**, the householder may punish him by making him a householder again and expelling him from the country.

## 86. Anisr̥ṣṭa (Unpermitted) Food

Anisr̥ṣṭa related to food is of two types: 1. Swami-viṣayak (related to the owner), 2. Hasti-viṣayak (related to the elephant).

**Swami-viṣayak:** Swami-viṣayak Chollka is of two types: Chhinna and Acchinna. When a householder prepares food for the laborers working in his field and sends it separately, it is called Chhinna. When he sends food for all the laborers together in the same vessel, it is called Acchinna. If the householder sends the collective food meant for the laborers also for donation to a monk, it is called Nisr̥ṣṭa-Anuññāta. Without the householder's permission, it is called Anisr̥ṣṭa. In Chhinna Chollka, the permission of the original owner is not required. If each laborer wishes to give his individual food, it is acceptable for the monk. In Acchinna, if all the owners give permission, then it is acceptable for the monk to accept the food.

**Hasti-viṣayak:** Even if the food of the elephant is permitted by the Mahāvat (elephant keeper), it is not acceptable. If the Mahāvat's own food is unseen by the elephant, then it is acceptable for the monk. Taking unpermitted Rajapiṇḍa (food offered to the king) and Gajapiṇḍa (food offered to the elephant) leads to Antarāya (obstruction) and Adattādāna (unaccepted donation) etc. faults. Taking Rajapiṇḍa without the king's permission can lead to the king dismissing the Mahāvat etc. from their jobs, causing the monk to incur the fault of Antarāya due to the disruption of their livelihood.

Explaining the reason for not taking Gajabhukta (food offered to the elephant), the commentator says that seeing the Mahāvat giving donations daily, the elephant may become angry and think that this monk takes my food every day. Seeing the monk in the shelter, he may break the shelter and in anger, even kill the monk. Therefore, food given by the Mahāvat in the presence of the elephant should not be accepted.

It is a matter of investigation why only the elephant is mentioned and not the cow, buffalo, horse, dog etc. in the Tiryañc (animals). The following possible reasons can be considered:

- The food given to the elephant may contain more human-edible substances.
- Around the time of the composition of Piṇḍaniryukti, there may have been an incident where an elephant injured a monk who continuously accepted alms.
- Compared to other creatures, the elephant's understanding is more mature.

The commentator of Mūlācāra has interpreted the Sanskrit shadow of 'Aṇisatt' as Anīśārtha. In Angārādharmāmṛta, this...

1. Piṇi 181/1.
2. Jībhā 1277; Parichhiṇṇam ciya dijati, eso chhinno muṇetavvo.

## Pindianuyukti: An Observation

87

The term "Nishiddha Dosha" refers to a prohibited fault. The Digambar texts like Charitrasar, Mulachar, etc., explain this fault with some differences. There are two types of Anissatta - Ishwar and Anishwar. Both of these have four sub-types: 1. Saraksha 2. Vyakt 3. Avyakt 4. Sanghat. 16. Adhyavpurka Dosha

For a householder, cooking food with an increased quantity for a Sadhu, when remembered later, is considered Adhyavpurka Dosha. It is also called Adhyavtar. In the Digambar tradition, instead of Adhyavpurka, a fault called Adhyadhi is found, which is also called Sadhik. Its alternative meaning is found in Mulachar as follows: "Ahva Pagam Tu Jav Roho Wa" - meaning, to stop a Muni until the food is completely prepared is also Adhyadhi Dosha.

The difference between Mishrajat and Adhyavpurka is that in Mishrajat, the quantity of rice, water, fruits, vegetables, etc., is increased from the beginning for the Sadhu, while in Adhyavtar or Adhyavpurka, the quantity is increased in the middle.

Adhyavpurka Dosha is of three types: 1. Swagrihayaavadarthik Mishra 2. Swagrihasadhumishra 3. Swagrihapashandimishra. The explanation of all three is clear from their names. Among these, Swagrihayaavadarthik Mishra falls under Vishudhikote. This means that if Yaavadarthik Mishra Adhyavpurka food is mixed with pure food, then removing that quantity or giving it to the Bhikshacharya purifies the food. The remaining food can be considered fit for the Muni. But if Swagrihapashandimishra and Swagrihasadhumishra Adhyavpurka cooked food falls into pure food, then it becomes contaminated with Puti Dosha. Even after separating that quantity or giving it to the Pashandis, the remaining food is not considered fit for the Sadhu.

In the two verses of Mulachar where the 16 faults of Udgam are mentioned, the first name is Adhakarma. But adding Adhakarma makes 17 faults of Udgam, therefore, in the Digambar tradition, Adhakarma is not included with the 16 faults. The commentators of Mulachar explain this by saying that Adhakarma (Adhakarma) is a Mahadosha. It is associated with Pancha Suna (violence place) and the killing of six living beings.

## Pinḍaniyukti: An Observation

• In place of the *abhihat* fault mentioned in *Mūlācāra*, the fault is *abhigat*.

• In place of the *mālāpahat* fault, *Mūlācāra* mentions *mālāroh* and *Anāgāradharmāmṛta* mentions *āroh* fault.

• In place of the *prābhṛtika* fault, *Mūlācāra* mentions *prāvartita* and *Anāgāradharmāmṛta* mentions *prābhṛtak* fault.

• In place of the *prāmitya* fault in *Mūlācāra*, *prāmṛṣya* is mentioned, and in place of *āccheḍya*, *accheḍya* fault is mentioned.

• In place of the *anisṛṣṭa* fault, *Anāgāradharmāmṛta* mentions the *niṣiddha* fault.

• The *bali* fault mentioned in *Mūlācāra* and *Anāgāradharmāmṛta* is an additional fault. It cannot be compared to any other fault. Giving the remaining portion of the offering made for Yakṣas, Nāgas, Kuladevatās, Pitṛs, etc., to the Muni is the *bali* fault.

The *udgama* faults found in Āgama literature are rare to find elsewhere. The Tīrthaṅkaras and Jain Ācāryas have described the non-violent nature of the mendicant's begging in such detail. The 42 faults of *bhikṣācaryā* are not found together in Āgama literature. There, the names of almost all the faults, except for *mūlakarma*, are found scattered. Some additional faults are also mentioned there. Here, a collection of *udgama* faults found scattered in Āgama literature is presented.

• *Ācāra-cūlā*: *ādhākarma*, *auddesika*, *miśrajāt*, *krītakṛta*, *prāmitya*, *āccheḍya*, *anisṛṣṭa* and *abhihat* faults.

• *Sūtrakṛtāṅga*: *auddesika*, *ādhākarma*, *krīta*, *prāmitya*, *āccheḍya*, *anisṛṣṭa*, *abhihat* and *pūti* faults.

• *Stānāṅga*: *ādhākarmic*, *auddesika*, *miśrajāt*, *adhyavatar*, *pūtik*, *krīta*, *prāmitya*, *āccheḍya*, *anisṛṣṭa* and *abhihat* faults.

• *Bhagavati*: *ādhākarma*, *auddesika*, *miśrajāt*, *adhyavatar*, *pūtik*, *krīta*, *prāmitya*, *āccheḍya*, *anisṛṣṭa* and *abhihat* faults.

• *Praśnavyākaraṇa*: *uddiṣṭa*, *sthāpita*, *prāduṣkaraṇa*, *prāmitya*, *miśrak* (*miśrajāt*), *krītakṛta*, *prābhṛta* (*prābhṛtika*), *āccheḍya* and *anisṛṣṭa* faults.

*Jñātādharmkathā* and *Antakṛddasā* etc. texts also mention *ādhākarmic*, *auddesika* and *krītakṛta* etc. faults.

Here, the point to be discussed is that *Daśavaikalika* is the representative text of *sādhvācāra*, in which the *udgama* faults are mentioned.

The text describes the defects of "piṇḍaniyukti" -  "auddeshika", "krītakṛta", "abhihata", "pūtikarma", "adhyavatra", "prāmitya" and "miśrajāta" - but does not mention the defect of "ādhākarma". There are a few possible reasons for this omission:

*  Ācārya Śayyambhava may have included "ādhākarma" within the "auddeshika" defect.
*  The "ādhākarma" defect may not have been widely used until after Ācārya Śayyambhava's time.
*  The "karmapravāda" text, which is the source for the study of "piṇḍaiṣaṇā", does not mention "ādhākarma", so it may not have been included.

The text also mentions that some of the 52 "anācāra" (unlawful acts) described in the "Daśāśrutaskandha" and "Daśavaikālika" are related to the defects of "bhikṣācaryā" (begging for alms):

1. "auddeshika" - the second defect of "udgama" (origin).
2. "krītakṛta" - the third defect of "udgama".
3. "abhihata" - the eleventh defect of "udgama".
4. "ājīvavṛttita" - the fourth defect of "utpādana" (production).
5. "taptānivr̥tabhojitva" - the ninth defect of "eṣaṇā" (desire).

In conclusion, the systematic and sequential description of the sixteen defects of "udgama" in one place is a unique contribution of the "piṇḍaniyuktikāra". Although the defects of "prābhṛtika", "parivartana", etc. are not mentioned frequently in the "āgama" literature, the seeds of these defects can be found in the "āgama" literature. The "niyuktikāra" has systematically explained these defects.

The text then discusses the defects related to "utpādana" (production). "Utpādana" means to produce. In the "pañcavastū" (five substances), "utpādana", "sampādana" (acquisition), and "nirvartana" (completion) are considered synonymous. The "niyuktikāra" has provided a detailed explanation of the term "utpādana" based on name, establishment, and substance. There are two types of "bhāva-utpādana" (production of emotions): "praśasta" (praiseworthy) and "apraśasta" (unpraiseworthy). The production of knowledge, perception, and character, etc. is "praśasta bhāva-utpādana". The production of food, etc. due to anger, etc. or through "dhātrīkaraṇa" (nursing) and other unethical business practices is "apraśasta bhāva-utpādana". The sixteen defects of "utpādana" are related to the "sādhu" (holy person).

1. "dhātrīdoṣa" (defect of nursing)
The defect of "dhātrīdoṣa" is to obtain food by feeding a child, like the five types of "dhāy" (nurse). A "dhātrī" is one who carries a child, nourishes the child, or whom the child drinks from.

The text then lists several references from different Jain scriptures related to the "dhātrīdoṣa" and other defects.

Page #105:
---------------------------
## Pinḍaniyukti: An Observation

In ancient times, there were five types of Dhātrīs (nurses) based on their responsibilities:

1. **Kṣīradhātrī:** Breastfeeding the child.
2. **Majjanadhātrī:** Bathing the child.
3. **Maṇḍanadhātrī:** Adorning the child.
4. **Krīḍanadhātrī:** Playing with the child.
5. **Aṅkadhātrī:** Holding the child in their lap.

There are some variations in the names of these Dhātrīs in Digambara literature. In Mūlācāra, the names are **Mārjan, Maṇḍan, Krīḍan, Kṣīra, and Amba**, while in Anagāradharmāmṛta, the names are **Mārjan, Krīḍan, Staṇyapan, Svāpan, and Maṇḍan**.

The Dhātrī-doṣa (fault of a nurse) can be committed in two ways: by personally acting as a Dhātrī or by causing others to act as one.

To clarify the concept of Dhātrī-doṣa, the Niyuktikāra (one who appoints) explains that if a monk, while begging for alms, sees a child crying and tells the householder that the child is dependent on milk and is crying because of its absence, and then asks for alms to feed the child with milk, or asks for alms after feeding the child with milk, or says that he will return to beg for alms, or says that they should feed the child or he will, then the householder, if she is kind-hearted, may commit violence due to affection for the monk. If she is not righteous, she may develop hatred. If the child falls ill due to some reason or karma, the preaching will be neglected. People may criticize the monk, considering him to be flattering, and the householder may also doubt the monk's character.

If the monk tries to replace one Dhātrī with another, it also falls under Dhātrī-doṣa. For example, if a monk, while begging for alms, sees a woman distressed and asks her the reason for her sorrow, and she says that her position as a Dhātrī has been taken away and another woman has been appointed in her place, causing her livelihood to be disrupted, then the monk, while consoling her, learns about the age, size, and thinness of the newly appointed Dhātrī and tells the wealthy person that their ancestors lacked knowledge about Dhātrīs or that their wealth has only recently increased, which is why such an inexperienced Dhātrī has been appointed. If the wealthy householder, after hearing all this from the monk, dismisses the newly appointed Dhātrī and appoints the old one again, then his statement is considered to be Dhātrī-doṣa. This can make the newly appointed Dhātrī resentful. Out of revenge, she may:

It can also lead to false accusations. The old Dhaatri may think that this Muni, like the new Dhaatri, may also create obstacles in her life, so she may use poison, etc., to kill the Sadhu.
Similarly, the author has described in detail the psychological description of the remaining four Dhaatris, including the Majjan Dhaatri. This entire description not only depicts the cultural situation of that time, but also the entire context is very important from the point of view of Ayurveda. To clarify the Dhaatri Pind, the author has described the story of Sangam Acharya and the Datta Shishya.

## 2. Dooti Dosha
Obtaining alms by conveying a person's message to another place through diplomatic work is Dooti Dosha. According to Moolaachar, going to one's own village or another village by water, land or air and obtaining food by conveying the message of the concerned person is Dooti Dosha. The commentator has explained this by considering it as a masculine gender, considering it as a "Dut Dosha". Diplomatic work is of two types - related to one's own village and related to another village. Conveying a message in the same village where the Sadhu lives is Dootity related to one's own village, and conveying a message by going to another nearby village is Dootity related to another village. There are two sub-categories of both - concealed and revealed. In the transcendental, there is only concealed Dootity. In the worldly, both concealed and revealed diplomatic work takes place.
While going for alms, if the Muni takes the message of his mother, father, etc., to his own village or another village, saying that your mother has said this or your father has said this, it is revealed Dootity related to one's own village and another village. So that the other Muni next to him does not know, the Muni says in a symbolic language that your daughter is not clever, she is ignorant by tradition, that's why she told me to give this message to my mother. At that time, the mother also answers skillfully that I will explain to my daughter. She will not give such a message in the future, this is concealed Dootity related to one's own village and another village in the transcendental. Conveying a message in this way in one's own village or another village, so that neither the people know nor the Muni next to him, this is concealed Dootity related to one's own village and another village in the worldly. For example, saying that the desired work has been completed according to your wish or I will do as they wish. The employer has hinted at a poignant story in the context of revealed Dootity related to another village, which presents a beautiful picture of the harm caused by the diplomatic work done by the Muni.

## Pinḍaniyukti: An Observation 3. Nimitta Dosha

Claiming to have knowledge of the past, present, and future, and using this to obtain alms by stating six types of causes (nimitta), benefits (laabha), disadvantages (alaabha), happiness (sukha), sorrow (duhkha), and life and death (jeevan-maran) is a Nimitta Dosha. According to the Angaar Dharmaamrit, obtaining food by pleasing the donor by stating eight types of causes (nimitta) is a Nimitta Dosha. The commentator considers a sadhu who uses knowledge (vidya), mantras (mantra), and causes (nimitta) as charan-kushila. The Manusmriti also prohibits taking alms by stating causes (nimitta). According to Nisiitha, a muni who claims to know the present and future causes is liable for atonement. Jinabhadragani Kshamasraman also considers stating causes related to the present and future more blameworthy than stating causes related to the past. Therefore, there is a difference in the atonement for both. The author of Pinḍaniyukti has indicated a story to clarify the harms caused by Nimitta Dosha. The Nisiitha Bhashya discusses the faults arising from stating causes (nimitta) in detail. Taking alms with Nimitta Dosha carries the fear of self-violence (svapar ki himsa).

## 4. Aajivana Dosha

Taking alms by introducing oneself based on one's caste (jati), lineage (kul), group (gan), etc. is Aajivana Dosha. The Nisiitha Sutra states that a muni who enjoys Aajivapinda is liable for atonement. The Dashakalika Sutra considers Aajivavrittita as misconduct. The commentator considers a sadhu who takes alms by Aajivana as kushila.

Aajivana Dosha occurs in five ways: caste (jati), lineage (kul), group (gan), karma, and craft (shilp). The Mulaachar considers caste (jati), lineage (kul), craft (shilp), penance (tap), and wealth (aishwarya) as Aajivana.

The five types of Aajivana Dosha occur in two ways: explicitly stating them (spasht shabdon se kathana) and implicitly stating them through indirect words (prakarantar se asphut vachan se kathana). The author has expressed this using the terms "sucha" and "asucha". The author has presented a psychological and subtle analysis of the five types.

## Jati-Aajivana

Caste (jati) is related to the maternal side. Obtaining food and other things from a householder based on caste (jati) is...

**Caste-based livelihood** is a type of livelihood. Seeing a Brahmin's son performing rituals like Homa correctly, a Muni knows that he is a Brahmin who has been in a Gurukul. Or, the Muni asks the father if his son performed the Homa rituals correctly or incorrectly. Hearing this, the father knows that the Muni must be from a Brahmin lineage, otherwise how would he know about these rituals? This is livelihood based on caste through inference. When the Muni himself clearly states his caste, this is livelihood based on caste through direct statement. Similarly, one should know about lineage, clan, profession, and craft.

If a householder is virtuous, he can provide a Sadhu with food that is **half-karma** in the context of livelihood based on caste. If he is wicked, he can insult the Sadhu and throw him out of the house.

**Lineage-based livelihood**

Lineage is related to the paternal side. Earning a living by mentioning one's own or another's lineage is lineage-based livelihood. Explaining lineage-based livelihood, the commentator says that a Muni entering a fierce lineage sees the householder's son engaged in the work of a guard and asks the father if his son is skilled in the deployment of foot soldiers. Hearing this, he knows that the Muni is born into a fierce lineage. When the Muni clearly reveals his lineage, saying "I am from a fierce or prosperous lineage," this is revealing the lineage through direct statement.

**Profession and Craft-based livelihood**

Agriculture and machine operation are considered professions, while sewing and weaving are considered crafts. Another definition is that what is learned by oneself without a teacher is a profession, and what is taught by a teacher is a craft.

Seeing many things related to profession and craft, knowing whether they are correct or incorrect through one's own skill, or stating it clearly, is livelihood based on profession and craft.

**Clan-based livelihood**

Clan means a group of wrestlers. Earning a living by mentioning one's clan skills is clan-based livelihood.

Page #109:
---------------------------
**Piṇḍaniyukti:** This is an observation. In the **Sthānāṅga Sūtra**, it is called **Liṅga Ājīvanā**. **Liṅga Ājīvanā** refers to a knowledge-less ascetic receiving alms solely based on their ascetic lineage.

The **Vyavahāra Bhāṣya** mentions **Tap** and **Śruta Ājīvanā** in addition to these five. Receiving alms by mentioning one's own austerities is **Tap Ājīvanā**, and receiving alms by revealing one's knowledge is **Śruta Ājīvanā**.

**Ājīvanā** is a fault that arises from consuming food that is tainted. It leads to the concealment of strength and the manifestation of the monk's humility.

**5. Vanīpaka Fault**

The word **Vanīpaka** is derived from the root **Vanu-yācanā**. It is the fault of begging for food by presenting oneself as a devotee of ascetics, Brahmins, the poor, guests, dogs, etc., or by praising them. According to **Abhaydeva Sūri**, **Vanī** is the wealth obtained by showing one's poverty to others or by speaking in a way that pleases them. One who drinks it, i.e., enjoys or protects it, is called **Vanīpaka**.

The **Niyuktikāra** explains through an analogy: Just as a cowherd searches for another cow for a calf whose mother has died, similarly, due to greed for food, etc., begging with humility by presenting oneself as a devotee of ascetics, the poor, guests, and dogs, is the **Vanīpaka** fault. In **Digambara** texts, it is called **Vanīpakocti**.

The author has presented a beautiful discussion of the language used by ascetics in front of devotees.

In front of **Śākya-Bauddha** devotees, the ascetic says that **Bauddha** monks eat without attachment, like a painted wall. They are supremely compassionate and generous. If the charity given to the highly attached Brahmins is not wasted, then how can the charity given to **Śākya** and other ascetics be in vain?

In front of **Brahmin** devotees, the ascetic praises the Brahmins, engaging in **Vanīpaka**. He says that Brahmins roam the earth in the form of gods, therefore, charity given to benevolent Brahmins is very fruitful. What to say about the benefits of giving to Brahmins engaged in the six duties?

In front of **poor** devotees, the monk says that this world is full of worship and adoration. One who gives charity to the poor, the suffering, the friendless, the sick, or the lame without any expectation, steals the banner of charity.

The Muni says in front of the guests that people often give donations to benefactors, acquaintances, and dependents, but the donation given to those who entertain guests is superior.

The Muni says to the dog-devotees while performing Vanipaktav that you alone know how to give donations in this world. These dogs are special deities of Mount Kailash, they are wandering on earth in the form of Yakshas. Their worship is beneficial and their disregard is harmful. Food like grass etc. becomes easily available for cows, bulls etc., but food is not easily available for these dogs, therefore, giving donations to them is superior. By accepting from dogs etc., acceptance from crows etc. also takes place.

The author, while pointing out the flaws, says that the statement that the donation given to a worthy or unworthy person is not in vain is flawed because it equates the worthy and the unworthy. Praising unworthy donations is highly flawed. This leads to the establishment of falsehood, there is a possibility of the fault of half-heartedness, the possibility of the saint being included in their order due to greed for food, and the belief spreads among people that these saints are flattering, they flatter for the sake of getting food. If the donor is hateful and not a devotee of Shakyas etc., he may say contemptuously, "Don't come here again." Accepting Vanipakpind reveals poverty.

**6. Medical Flaw**

Taking alms by giving medical advice or preaching like a physician is a medical flaw. In Mulachar, taking alms by preaching eight types of medical treatment is called a medical flaw. In Angar Dharmamrut, it is mentioned as Vaidyak Dosha. In the Parishha study of Uttaradhyayanas, it is mentioned that the saint should not give importance to medical treatment. His Shramanya can remain safe only if he does not get medical treatment and does not treat others. A monk who consumes medical pind is liable for atonement.

## Pindaniyukti: An Observation

**•** When a householder asks for medical advice, the monk should say, "I am not a physician." This statement will make the householder understand that the illness is serious and they should consult a physician. 

**•** In another type of medical advice, when the householder asks about the diagnosis, the monk might say, "I too suffered from this illness in the past, and I recovered by consuming such and such medicine." Or, they might say, "We monks treat illnesses that arise suddenly through tapasya (austerities) like fasting and oil massage." 

**•** In the third type of medical advice, the monk acts as a physician themselves, cleansing the stomach and calming the bile, then diagnosing the illness.

According to the Jitakalp Bhashya, the first two types of medical advice are subtle (sukshma) and the third type is a form of coarse (badar) medical advice.

There are two potential drawbacks to receiving alms through treating an un-restrained householder:

**•** The use of medicinal herbs like roots and tubers in treatment can lead to the killing of living beings (jiva-himsa).

**•** It can increase the householder's unrestrained behavior (asanyama) because they become strong like a heated iron ball and become the cause of violence against many living beings. The author uses the example of a weak tiger to illustrate this important point. To understand the depth of this principle, one should read the "Chaupai" on charity and compassion by Acharya Bhikṣu and the book "Bhikṣu Vichar Darshan" by Acharya Mahaprajna.

**•** If the illness worsens despite the monk's treatment, the householder might blame the monk and even have them punished by the king, which would lead to criticism of the teachings.

**•** **Krodha Pind:** The food that a monk receives through the influence of their knowledge and austerities, the favor of the royal family, and their physical strength is called Krodha Pind. When a monk is angry because they are not given alms, the householder thinks, "The monk's anger is not good for my future. If I don't give alms to the monk, the king will be angry with me because they are favored by the king." This is how they receive alms through fear of the monk's anger. To explain Krodha Pind, the author mentions the story of a thief in Hastakalp Nagar.

Page #112:
---------------------------
## Pindaniyukti 8. Manapind

To beg for alms with pride when encouraged by others or upon hearing words of praise and gain, or to beg for alms when humiliated by another, is the Manapind fault. To clarify the Manapind fault, the author has described in detail the story of the Kshapaka who brought Sevayi.

The Manapind fault, when committed while accepting alms, can sometimes lead to hatred and distance between husband and wife. If a Muni accepts alms from a husband against the wishes of his wife, using it as a reason for humiliation, it can lead to suicide by one of them. Accepting Manapind also leads to neglect of preaching.

## 9. Mayapind

To accept alms deceitfully is the Mayapind fault. The author has not clarified the nature of Mayapind, but has only hinted at the story of Ashadhabhuti.

## 10. Lobhapind

To search for a particular item with greed, by any means, or to accept an excessive amount of heavy or superior food is the Lobhapind fault. The author has hinted at the story of the Sadhu who received saffron sweets in Lobhapind.

These four Pindas are the cause of Karmabandha, and also the reason for the lightness of preaching.

## 11. Sanstav Dosha

To praise the giver before or after accepting alms, or to establish a relationship, is the Sanstav Dosha. This is of two types: 1. Vachan Sanstav 2. Sambandhi Sanstav. Both of these have two sub-categories, before and after. The Nisith Bhashya describes many more sub-categories of Sanstav in detail. The explanation of these four sub-categories is as follows:

* **Purvavachan Sanstav:** To praise the good or bad qualities of the giver before accepting alms, saying that your fame is spread in all ten directions.

Page #113:
---------------------------
**Piṇḍaniyukti: A Supervision Constraint is Resonating**

For many days, we have heard about your generosity, but today we have witnessed this quality of yours firsthand. Your spirit of giving is unparalleled, and so on. Thus, praising the donor before receiving alms is called **pūrvavacana-sanstava**.

In the Digambara tradition, the terms **pūrvasanstuti** and **paścātsanstuti** are used. According to them, telling the donor that you are a generous patron like Yaśodhara, and reminding them that you are a great giver, how can you forget to give now, is a **pūrvasanstuti** fault.

**Paścādvacana-sanstava** is praising the donor after receiving alms, saying that my eyes have been purified by meeting you. Earlier, I had doubts about your qualities, but seeing you, I have realized that your qualities are truly renowned.

**Pūrvāsambandhi-sanstava** is establishing a relationship with a donor as a father, mother, or sister while receiving alms. The monk entering for alms, seeing his age and the age of the housewife, establishes a relationship accordingly, saying that my mother, sister, daughter, or granddaughter was like this. Establishing a relationship before marriage is **pūrvāsambandhi-sanstava**.

**Paścātsambandhi-sanstava** is establishing a relationship with the donor as a father-in-law, mother-in-law, or wife according to age while receiving alms. Seeing a donor, the monk says that my mother-in-law or wife was like you.

In the **Jītakalpabhāṣya**, establishing a relationship or praising a woman is more blameworthy than a man in all four categories. The faults arising from **pūrvāsambandhi-sanstava** and **paścātsambandhi-sanstava** can be presented in the following points:

* If the housewife is of a proud nature, she may think that this monk is a magician and a flatterer. He is insulting us by calling us mother, wife, etc. She may become angry and throw the monk out of the house.
* If the housewife's husband hears this, he may kill the monk immediately.

## 100. Pindaniyukti

It is said that a muni's vow of celibacy can be broken by mental disturbance caused by a woman's behavior as a wife. 
• If the woman is of good character, a loving relationship can be established between them, and she may even give her widowed daughter-in-law in charity.

## 12. Vidyapind Dosha

Vidyā is that which has a presiding deity and is perfected through chanting, homa, etc. Obtaining alms by demonstrating Vidyā is Vidyapind Dosha. According to Mulachar, it is a Vidyā Dosha to obtain food by enticing someone with the promise of Vidyā or by extolling its virtues. The author of the Niyukti has alluded to the story of a mendicant and a devotee in relation to Vidyā. The use of Vidyā can lead to a person being affected by it or someone else associated with them using counter-Vidyā to harm the muni. The use of Vidyā can also lead to people accusing the muni of being a sinner, a magician, and a manipulator. Complaints to the king can lead to persecution and punishment by the king's men.

## 13. Mantra Pind Dosha

Mantra is that which has a presiding deity and is perfected simply by chanting without the need for homa, etc. Obtaining alms by performing miracles through the use of Mantra is Mantra Pind Dosha. The author of the Niyukti has referred to the story of King Murunda and Acharya Padalipta in relation to Mantra. The use of Mantra Pind carries the same faults as those mentioned for Vidyapind. According to the author, Mantra can be used correctly in exceptional circumstances for the benefit of the community.

Mulachar also explains this in a different way by considering Vidyā and Mantra together. According to it, calling upon the external deities who give food and perfecting them with Vidyā and Mantra is Vidyā Mantra Dosha.

## Pinḍaniyukti: An Observation

**101.14. Cūrṇapiṇḍa Doṣa**

Obtaining alms by becoming invisible through the use of collyrium (anjan) etc., or by subduing someone with powder (cūrṇa) and then obtaining alms, is called cūrṇapiṇḍa doṣa. The same faults that exist in the use of knowledge (vidyā) and mantra-piṇḍa are also present in the consumption of cūrṇapiṇḍa. By using cūrṇapiṇḍa, one can obtain hatred and even cause the death of a muni. In the Digambara tradition, the explanation of cūrṇa doṣa is different. There, it is not the use of collyrium etc. that makes one invisible, but rather the use of powder to cleanse the eyes and powder to adorn and illuminate the body, and then obtaining food through this is considered cūrṇa doṣa. The antardhāna piṇḍa mentioned in Niśītha can be included under cūrṇapiṇḍa. The author has alluded to the story of Cāṇakya and the two Kṣullakas in the context of cūrṇapiṇḍa doṣa. When the use of cūrṇapiṇḍa is detected, it leads to disrespect for the sādhutva and the saṅgha.

**15. Yogapiṇḍa Doṣa**

Obtaining alms by using foot-ointment (pādalepa) or fragrant substances, by walking on water, or by flying in the sky, is called yogapiṇḍa doṣa. The example of Ārya Samita and the Kulapati falls under yogapiṇḍa. Ārya Samita did not use yoga to influence people or to obtain alms, but rather to influence the saṅgha.

There is no significant difference between cūrṇa and yoga in terms of the substance used. Dry or moist powder (kṣoda) produced from ordinary substances is called cūrṇa, and dry or paste-like (lepa) powder produced from fragrant substances is called yoga.

**16. Mūlakarma Doṣa**

To damage someone's virginity through the use of practices, or to insert something into someone's vagina, i.e., to make them fit for enjoyment by removing their virginity, is called mūlakarma. In the Piṇḍaviśuddhiprakaraṇa, bathing for good fortune, tying a rakṣābandhan, conception, abortion, marriage, and the use of incense etc. are considered to be under mūlakarma. According to mūlācāra, to subdue those who are not under control, and to bring together those who are separated, is mūlakarma. Obtaining food through this is mūlakarma doṣa. In the Anagāradharmāmṛta, there is also mention of vaśa doṣa in its place. Mūlakarma denotes a broader context. Subduing someone is just one application of mūlakarma.

## Pinḍa Niyukti

According to the commentator Yashodeva Suri of the Piṇḍaviśuddhiprakaraṇa, the use of Mūlakarma is the most serious and harmful of the 47 faults of Bhiksha.

The fault of Mūlakarma related to Bhiksha is not mentioned anywhere in the Āgama literature. The term Mūlakarma is mentioned in the Praśna Vyākaraṇa (2/12), but there is no context of Bhiksha. In this context, it can be assumed that Mūlakarma was not used for obtaining Bhiksha by Mahavira and for some years after him, but later, in the course of time, some Sadhu might have used it. This is why the Piṇḍaniyuktikāra has linked it with the fault of Utpādana. The Niśītha also mentions 15 faults of Utpādana, but it does not mention Mūlakarma.

The Tattvārtha Bhāṣya mentions two types of Mūlakarma - Garbhādāna and Garbha-Pariśāṭana. In this, the Niyuktikāra mentions the narratives of a girl of different Yoni and two queens.

The use of Karma leads to the fault of violence. Making a woman Akshat Yoni increases her sexual desire, and causing an abortion can lead to intense anger in the person involved, which disrespects the preaching. Making a woman Kshatayoni leads to Bhogantaray for the Sadhu for life. The Jītakalpa Bhāṣya also mentions the faults of accusation, etc., arising from Mūlakarma.

There is a difference in the order and names of the Utpādana faults in the Śvetāmbara and Digambara traditions. Here, a chart is presented with the names of the faults obtained in the Śvetāmbara Āgama and the Digambara tradition along with Piṇḍaniyukti.

## Pinḍaniryukti: An Observation

The term "dūtdoṣa" is mentioned in Mūlācāra instead of "dūtidoṣa".

In Mūlācāra, instead of terms like "krodhapiṇḍa", the specific characteristics of the individual are mentioned, such as "krodhī", "mānī", "māyī", and "lobhī".

In Niśītha, the "sanstavadoṣa" is not mentioned along with the 15 other faults, but in another context, the one who performs "puraḥ" and "paścāt" sanstava is considered liable for atonement. In Piṇḍaniryukti, "pūrvastuṭi" and "paścātstuṭi" are included under the "sanstavadoṣa", while in Mūlācāra and Anagāradharmāmṛta, "sanstavadoṣa" is considered as two separate faults. Anagāradharmāmṛta mentions "prāknuti" and "paścātṇuti", while Mūlācāra mentions "pūrvastuṭi" and "paścātstuṭi". Although there is a difference in words, the meaning is the same.

In Anagāradharmāmṛta, "vaidyaka doṣa" is mentioned instead of "cikitsā doṣa".

In the Digambara tradition, "cūrṇa" and "yoga" are considered together, while in Piṇḍaniryukti, they are considered as separate faults.

In the thirteenth context of Niśītha, 15 faults related to "utpādana" are mentioned in one place, but there, the "chedasūtrakara" has not mentioned them as faults of "utpādana". The "antaradhāna doṣa" is considered as an independent fault, not under "cūrṇapiṇḍa", and the "mūlakarma doṣa" is not mentioned. Ācārya Bhadravāhu has declared the muni who consumes these faults liable for atonement.

## Faults of Grahaṇaiṣaṇā

Consuming food without any faults like "udgama", "utpādana", "śaṅkā", etc., is called "grahaṇaiṣaṇā". In Pañcavastū, the word "aiṣaṇā" is used in the context of "grahaṇaiṣaṇā". There, "aiṣaṇā", "gaveṣaṇā", "anveṣaṇā", and "grahaṇa" are considered synonymous.

The faults of "udgama" are related to the householder, and the faults of "utpādana" are related to the sādhū. But the ten faults of "aiṣaṇā" are related to both the sādhū and the householder. Among these, "śaṅkita" and "bhāvataḥ apariṇata" are two faults related to the sādhū, and the remaining eight faults are generally caused by the householder. For these faults of "aiṣaṇā", the commentators of Mūlācāra and Anagāradharmāmṛta have also mentioned "aśana doṣa". Accepting alms with these faults of "grahaṇaiṣaṇā" leads to "pāpabandha", "hiṃsā", and disgust in the world. The ten faults of "grahaṇaiṣaṇā" are as follows:

1. Śaṅkita
2. Prakṣita
3. Nikṣipta
4. Pihita
5. Saṃhata
6. Dāyaka
7. Unmiśra
8. Apariṇata

**1. Sankit Dosha**

Taking alms when there is a possibility of doshas like Aadhkarma etc. is Sankit Dosha. Dashavaikalik explicitly mentions that a Muni should avoid food that is doubtful from the perspective of Kalpa and Akalpa. The author has given the following Chaturbhangi for Sankit:

* Sankit Grahan, Sankit Bhog
* Sankit Grahan, Nishankit Bhog
* Nishankit Grahan, Sankit Bhog
* Nishankit Grahan, Nishankit Bhog

The fourth bhang in this Chaturbhangi is pure. Niruktikar has explained all four bhangs in detail. Seeing the abundant alms offered at a householder's house, the Muni is unable to ask questions due to shyness. He takes the alms with doubt and consumes it in the same state, this is the explanation of the first bhang.

In the second bhang, the Muni is doubtful while taking the alms but while consuming it, another Muni clarifies that due to some incident, abundant food was prepared for a guest at that house or a Prahenak has come from another house. Hearing this, he consumes the alms without any doubt, this is the second option of Chaturbhangi.

In the third option, the Muni sees the same food items with other Munis while criticizing in front of the Guru, and doubt arises in his mind. Therefore, even though he has taken the alms without any doubt, he consumes it in a doubtful state. In the fourth bhang, there is no doubt in both situations, therefore it is pure and Eshaniya.

**2. Prakshit Dosha**

Taking alms with a hand or spoon etc. that is contaminated with Satchit etc. substances is Prakshit Dosha. It is considered the fourteenth Asamadhisthan in Samavayang and the fifteenth in Dasha Shruta Skandh. The commentator Malayagiri has also used the word Prakshipt instead of Prakshit. It is of two types:

1. Satchit Prakshit

Page #119:
---------------------------
## 105. Pindaniyukti: An Observation 2. AChitta Prakshit.

There are three types of Sachitta Prakshit: 1. PrithviKay Prakshit, 2. ApKay Prakshit, 3. VanaspatiKay Prakshit.

**Sachitta PrithviKay Prakshit:** Accepting alms with a hand or vessel that is touched by dry or moist Sachitta PrithviKay.

**ApKay Prakshit:** Accepting alms with a hand or vessel that is touched by dry or moist Sachitta Rasa (juices). There are four types of Sachitta ApKay Prakshit: 1. Purahkarma - Washing hands with Sachitta water before giving alms to a Sadhu. 2. Paschatkarma - Washing hands with Sachitta water after giving alms. 3. Sasnigdha - Accepting alms with hands slightly wet with Sachitta water. 4. Udaka - Accepting alms with a hand that is touched by Sachitta water that is dripping.

**VanaspatiKay Prakshit:** Accepting alms with a hand that is touched by the juices of a VanaspatiKay or any other ordinary plant's smooth parts.

The remaining three Kayas - Tejas, Vayu, and Tras - do not have Sachitta-AChitta forms of Prakshit, therefore they are not considered here.

There are eight Bhangs formed by the combination of Sansrusht hand, Sansrusht vessel, Savasesha dravya (substance with residue) and their opposites - Asansrusht hand, Asansrusht vessel, and Niravasesha dravya (substance without residue).

* Sansrusht hand, Sansrusht vessel, and Savasesha dravya.
* Sansrusht hand, Sansrusht vessel, and Niravasesha dravya.
* Sansrusht hand, Asansrusht vessel, and Savasesha dravya.
* Sansrusht hand, Asansrusht vessel, and Niravasesha dravya.
* Asansrusht hand, Sansrusht vessel, and Savasesha dravya.
* Asansrusht hand, Sansrusht vessel, and Niravasesha dravya.
* Asansrusht hand, Asansrusht vessel, and Savasesha dravya.
* Asansrusht hand, Asansrusht vessel, and Niravasesha dravya.

In the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth options, there is a possibility of Paschatkarma, therefore accepting alms in those Bhangs is prohibited. In the odd-numbered Bhangs, accepting alms is permissible because due to the presence of Savasesha, even if the hand and vessel are Sansrusht, there is no possibility of Paschatkarma.

1. Pini 243, Jiba 1491.
4. For clarification of Purahkarma and Paschatkarma, see Dasha 2, Jiba 1494, Pini 243/2.

## 106. Pindaniyukti

**Achett Mrakshit**

Achett Mrakshit also has four divisions related to the hand and the vessel. The four divisions involve the act of taking food. In these, alms are acceptable from a hand and vessel that are in contact with Agarhita Mrakshit, but there is a prohibition against Garhita Mrakshit. If a hand or vessel is smeared with Agarhita Gorasdrav, Madhu, Ghrita, Taila, Gud, etc., and is in contact with living beings, then alms are permissible in that situation because there is a possibility of violence against Makshika, Pipilika, etc. Generally, Sthavirakalpi Munis can accept alms with a hand smeared with Ghrita, Gud, etc., after following the proper procedure, but Jinakalpi Munis cannot accept alms with such hands. In the world, it is forbidden to take food from a hand or vessel smeared with Garhita Mans, Vasa, Shonit, and Madhira, etc., and in both worlds, Garhita Mutra and Mal are also unacceptable for a Sadhu.

**3. Nikshipta Dosha**

Accepting alms that are placed on Sachitta Prithvi, etc., is Nikshipta Dosha. In Dashavaikalika, it is clearly mentioned that Ashan, Pan, Khadim, and Swadim, etc., food items are unacceptable for a Sadhu if they are placed on water, Uttinga, or Panak, etc., or if they are placed on fire. Nikshipta Dosha is of two types: Sachitta and Achett.

Sachitta Nikshipta has two divisions: Anantara and Parampara. There are six ways in which the six Jeevanikayas of Prithvi, Ap, etc., can be deposited with each other:

1. Prithvikaaya on Prithvikaaya.
2. Prithvikaaya on Apkaaya.
3. Prithvikaaya on Tejaskaaya.
4. Prithvikaaya on Vayukaaya.
5. Prithvikaaya on Vanaspatikaaya.
6. Prithvikaaya on Traskaaya.

Similarly, there are six divisions for Apkaaya, etc. In these, one option is Svasthan and the remaining five are Parasthan. The seven types of Nikshep of Agnikaaya are as follows:

1. Vidhyat - The fire that is not visible initially but becomes visible later after adding fuel is called Vidhyat.

## Pinḍaniryukti: An Observation

**2. Murmur:** The half-cooked fire particles of āpingala color are called murmur.

**3. Angāra:** Fire without flames is called angāra.

**4. Aprāpta-jvalā:** A vessel placed on the stove, which does not touch the fire, is called aprāpta-jvalā.

**5. Prāpta-jvalā:** Fire that touches the pitharak is called prāpta-jvalā.

**6. Sama-jvalā:** Fire that touches the upper part of the vessel is called sama-jvalā.

**7. Vyutkrānta-jvalā:** Fire that rises above the vessel placed on the stove is called vyutkrānta-jvalā.

Just as a sa-citta deposit is made on a sa-citta, similarly, on mixed earth, there is a deposit of sa-citta earth, on sa-citta earth, there is a deposit of mixed earth, and on mixed earth, there is a deposit of mixed earth. Similarly, there are four divisions of deposit on a-citta with sa-citta and mixed. In these three four-fold divisions, the fourth division of the four-fold division related to a-citta is the object of bhakta-pāna.

Where there is a deposit on sa-citta, a-citta, or mixed substance, there are two types of mārgṇā: anantara and parampara. The anantara and parampara deposit of the ṣaḍ-jīvanikāya is as follows: where a thing is placed directly on sa-citta earth without any interval, it is the anantara deposit of the sa-citta-pṛthvīkāya. Similarly, the deposit on the pitharak etc. placed on the earth is parampara-nikshipta. Butter etc. placed in sa-citta water is anantara-nikshipta, and the butter placed in a boat in river water is parampara-nikshipta. *Grain husk blown by the wind is anantara-nikshipta, and the thing deposited on a vessel filled with air is parampara-nikshipta. From the perspective of the vanaspathikāya, the thing deposited on greenery is anantara-nikshipta, and the malpūā etc. deposited in the pitharak etc. placed on greenery is parampara-nikshipta. From the perspective of the trasakāya, the malpūā etc. placed on the back of a bull etc. is anantara-nikshipta, and the malpūā placed on the back of a bull in vessels like kutupa etc. is parampara-nikshipta. According to the commentator, the total number of divisions of nikshipta is 432.

By reading the entire context of nikshipta, it can be understood how meticulously the Jain ācāryas have thought about the bhikṣācāryā of a sadhu. There is no mention of such a subtle ahiṃsā-based bhikṣācāryā for the monastic class of any other religion.

## Pindaniyukti

Roasting or placing wheat etc. over fire in the seven types of fire is considered Anantar Nikshipt, and placing an object in a vessel over fire is called Parampar Nikshipt. In Parampar Nikshipt, the author has presented four options:

* **Paashravaalipta:** The vessel with a wide mouth placed over the fire should be covered with mud on all sides. If for any reason a drop of juice or water falls, the mud should absorb it, preventing harm to the Agnikai.
* **Anatyushna:** The sugarcane juice should not be excessively hot. Consuming excessively hot juice can lead to both self-harm and harm to others.
* **Aparishaati:** Aparishaati means that the juice should not fall while being offered. The falling of juice can potentially harm the Agnikai.
* **Aghattunt:** This means that the water or juice offered from the vessel should not be poured from the top edge (karna) of the vessel onto the hot surface. If it is poured from the top edge, there is a possibility of the drop falling into the fire and the top part of the vessel breaking, making it unsuitable.

The author has conceived 16 bhangas using a mathematical formula based on these four terms: Paashravaalipta, Anatyushna, Aparishaati, and Aghattunt. The first bhang is pure, and the remaining 15 are impure. The creation of these sixteen bhangas is as follows:

1. In the first row, sixteen bhangas are created by alternating short and long syllables.
2. In the second row, sixteen bhangas are created by having two short syllables followed by two long syllables.
3. In the third row, there are four short syllables followed by four long syllables, then again four short syllables and four long syllables.
4. In the fourth row, there are eight short syllables followed by eight long syllables.

These are established as follows:

ISISISISI SISISIS || ss ||ss ||ss ||ss || ||s sss || || ssss

|| || || || || ssss ssss

By picking up one bhang at a time from left to right, moving upwards from the bottom in all four rows, the sixteen bhangas are created as follows:

In these, the portions with straight lines are pure and the portions with s-shaped lines are impure. Of these sixteen bhangas, the first bhang is permitted. The remaining 15 bhangas are unacceptable. Based on four factors, the chart of bhangas can be presented as follows:

**4. Pihit Dosha**

Consuming food that is covered with sentient fruit or earth, etc., or that is hidden by an insentient guru substance is called Pihit Dosha. The fifth study of Dashavaikalik mentions that a woman who gives a sadhu an open vessel that is hidden by a water pot, millstone, grinding stone, stone child (lodha), mud plaster, or lac, etc., should be prohibited from giving alms. There are three types of this: 1. Sachitt 2. Achitt 3. Mishr. These three have three Chaturbhangis:

1. Mula 466:
> Sachitteṇ va pihidam, adhavā achittgurugapihidam ca. Tam chhanḍiya jam deyam, pihidam tam hodi bodhavvo||

2. Dasha 5/1/45, 46.

**Fourfold classification of *saccitta* and *misra*:**

1. *Saccitta* given as *saccitta* from *saccitta*.
2. *Saccitta* given as *saccitta* from *misra*.
3. *Misra* given as *misra* from *saccitta*.
4. *Misra* given as *misra* from *misra*.

All four options are inconceivable (inadmissible).

**Fourfold classification of *saccitta* and *acitta*:**

1. *Saccitta* given as *saccitta* from *saccitta*.
2. *Saccitta* given as *saccitta* from *acitta*.
3. *Acitta* given as *acitta* from *saccitta*.
4. *Acitta* given as *acitta* from *acitta*.

The first three options are inconceivable, and the fourth option is *bhajana*.

**Fourfold classification of *acitta* and *misra*:**

1. *Misra* given as *misra* from *misra*.
2. *Misra* given as *misra* from *acitta*.
3. *Acitta* given as *acitta* from *misra*.
4. *Acitta* given as *acitta* from *acitta*.

The first three options are inconceivable, and the fourth option is *bhajana*.

**Fourfold classification of the fourth option:**

1. Heavy object given as heavy from heavy object.
2. Heavy object given as heavy from light object.
3. Light object given as light from heavy object.
4. Light object given as light from light object.

In this fourfold classification, the first and third options are inadmissible, and the second and fourth options are admissible.

The commentator explains that when lifting a heavy object, if the object falls from the hand, there is a possibility of injury to the feet or limbs. If the object to be given is heavy, it is not necessary to lift it and give it.

1. *Pini* 259/1, *Mavri* p. 155.

## Pindaniyukti: An Observation

**111**  Alms can also be given from a bowl, etc., therefore alms are considered in the second alternative. In the fourth alternative, both items are light, therefore the item is acceptable in this alternative.

There are two divisions of each of the *saccitta pihita* etc. - *anantara* and *parampara*. *Saccitta* food etc. hidden by the lid of the earth is *anantara pihita*, and food placed on a *pithara* placed on the *saccitta* earth is *parampara pihita*. An item fumigated by embers is *anantara pihita*, and a *pithara* fumigated by embers or *sarava* etc. is *parampara pihita*. In the case of *angara-dhoopita* etc., the air that is *atirohita* is *anantara pihita*, and an item hidden by air-filled *drti* etc. is *parampara pihita*. Food hidden by *atirohita* fruit etc. is *anantara pihita*, and an item hidden by a *chabari* etc. filled with fruits is *parampara pihita*. In the context of *trasakaya*, food hidden by a tortoise etc. is *anantara pihita*, and an item hidden by a *pitharak* etc. impregnated by a tortoise, insect etc. is *parampara pihita*.

**5. Sanhrita Dosha**

If there is any *adeya ashan* etc. in the vessel from which alms are being given, it is a *sanhata dosha* to give alms after throwing it on the ground or elsewhere. In the *Jitakalp-bhashya*, *sanharan*, *utkirana* and *virechana* are considered synonymous. The fifth study of *Dashavaikalika* mentions that if a woman gives food and water by transferring it from one vessel to another, placing it on a *saccitta* object, shaking *saccitta* water, bathing in it, and walking on water that has fallen in the courtyard, then the muni should prohibit her. In *Moolachar*, the word *sanvyavaharan* is used in place of *sanhata*. According to it, it is a *sanvyavaharan dosha* to give food by pulling the cloth or vessel intended for the muni without looking at it. In *Anangardharmamrta*, it is mentioned as a general *dosha* in its place. It seems possible that the Prakrit transformation of *sanhrta* is *sanharan* or *saharan*. On the same basis, it is written as a general *dosha* in *Anangardharmamrta*.

Just as there are three *chaturbhangis* of *saccitta*, *acitta* and *misra* in the *nikshipta* and *pihita* *doshas*, so also there are *chaturbhangis* of this. Only the third *bhang* of the second and third *chaturbhangis* differs in the method of *margana*. The author has conceived of four *bhangs* on the basis of *shushk* and *ardra* *sanharan* and *sanhiyamana*.

1. *Shushk* on *shushk*. 3. *Ardra* on *shushk*.
2. *Shushk* on *ardra*. 4. *Ardra* on *ardra*.

**Pindaniyukti**

In this, the possibility of killing living beings is less when dry substances are compacted together. Therefore, if dry substances are compacted together, that substance may be acceptable to the Sadhu.

Due to the compacted fault, there is a possibility of harming the six-bodied being. Therefore, food with compacted fault is unacceptable to the Sadhu. Again, the author has explained this through the four-fold division based on little and much.

* Little dry on little dry.
* Little dry on much dry.
* Much dry on little dry.
* Much dry on much dry.

Where much dry is compacted on little dry and much dry is compacted on much dry, it is acceptable for the Sadhu to take food.

It is not acceptable to take food in these three divisions: dry on moist, moist on dry, or moist on moist.

If the acceptable substance is light in weight, and a light weight substance is placed on it, then it is acceptable to keep it elsewhere and take food, etc.

If the donor has difficulty in lifting or placing down a heavy or large vessel, and there is also a possibility of public criticism that this greedy Sadhu does not even consider the convenience or inconvenience of others. If the donor or his family members become unhappy if there is a limb fracture or the body burns while donating, then it leads to the cessation of other donations, and there is a possibility of killing the six-bodied being due to the substance coming out of the heavy vessel.

**_Each door, such as collection, etc., has 432 divisions based on the divisions. For example, the collection of sentient earth on sentient earth-bodied, the collection of sentient earth-bodied on sentient ap-bodied, etc. There are 36 divisions in relation to one's own body and another's body. From these, there are 12 divisions due to the three four-fold divisions of sentient, non-sentient, and mixed. Multiplying 12 by 36 gives 432 divisions._**

**6. Giver's Fault**

It is a giver's fault to accept alms from those who are ineligible to give alms. In Pindaniyukti, forty people are considered ineligible to give alms. Some of these faults are related to individuals, and some are related to cautious actions, and due to treatment, they are associated with the giver. The names of the prohibited givers are as follows:

1. Child, 2. Very old, 3. Intoxicated, 4. Possessed by a Yaksha, 5. Trembling body, 6. Feverish, 7. Blind, 8. Leprous, 9. Wearing sandals, 10. Wearing handcuffs, 11. Bound with chains, 12. Hands and feet cut off, 13. Impotent, 14. Pregnant woman, 15. Breastfeeding, 16. Eating, 17. Churning curd, 18. Picking chickpeas, 19. Grinding wheat, etc., 20. Grinding rice, etc. in a mortar, 21. Stone...

**113.** Grinding sesame seeds etc., **22.** Spinning cotton, **23.** Picking cotton, **24.** Spinning yarn, **25.** Using a spinning wheel, **26.** Holding water, plants etc. with conscious hands, **27.** Holding salt etc. with conscious hands, keeping the six kayas below, **28.** Crushing the six kayas with feet, **29.** Touching the six kayas with the body, **30.** Violating the six life-kayas, **31.** Having hands smeared with curd etc., **32.** Having a vessel smeared with curd etc., **33.** Giving from a large vessel, **34.** Giving another's belongings, **35.** Giving stolen goods, **36.** Removing the front kaval, **37.** A woman who is likely to fall etc., **38.** Giving food established for another sadhu, **39.** Giving knowingly impure food, **40.** Giving unknowingly impure food.

_The fifth Pindaiṣaṇa study of Dasavaikalika mentions the prohibited dayakas in a scattered manner._

**Oghanīyukti** mentions 20 faults related to dayakas: **1.** Avyakt (child), **2.** Aprābhū (one who does not own the house), **3.** Sthavira (elder), **4.** Napumsaka (impotent), **5.** Matta (intoxicated), **6.** Kṣipta citta (one whose mind is disturbed by theft of wealth etc.), **7.** Dīptacitta (one whose mind is disturbed by repeated defeat by an enemy), **8.** Yakṣaviṣṭa (possessed by a yakṣa), **9.** One with a cut hand, **10.** One with a severed leg, **11.** Blind, **12.** Chained, **13.** Leprous, **14.** Pregnant woman, **15.** Woman with a child, **16.** One who grinds grain, **17.** One who grinds it, **18.** One who roasts grain, **19.** One who spins yarn, **20.** One who spins cotton.

**Mūlācāra** considers the following individuals ineligible for alms: **1.** Dhāy (wet nurse), **2.** One intoxicated by alcohol, **3.** Sick, **4.** One who has gone to the cremation ground and returned, **5.** Napumsaka (impotent), **6.** Piśāca (one affected by water disease), **7.** Naked, **8.** One who has defecated, **9.** One who has fallen due to fainting, **10.** One who has vomited and come immediately, **11.** One with blood, **12.** Prostitute, **13.** Āryikā-śramaṇī (except for Raktāpattikā Āryikā etc.), **14.** One who has anointed the body, **15.** Ati bālā (small girl, here a small boy will also be included in the treatment), **16.** Ati vrddhā (very old), **17.** One who is eating, **18.** Pregnant woman (five months pregnant), **19.** Blind woman, **20.** A woman sitting behind or with the support of Antaritā-bhīta etc., **21.** One sitting below, **22.** One sitting in a high place, **23.** One who blows fire from the mouth, **24.** One who lights fire by putting wood, **25.** One who moves wood etc. in the Sāraṇa-chulha, **26.** One who covers the fire with ashes etc., **27.** One who extinguishes fire with water etc.

**28.** Those who extinguish a fire. **29.** Those who move a fire around or extinguish it. **30.** Those who plaster with cow dung, etc. **31.** Those who bathe or perform ablutions. **32.** Those who give alms while feeding a child with milk.

The commentary on Pravachana-sara-uddhar mentions 29 ineligible donors, with a different order: **1.** Stavira, **2.** Aprubhu, **3.** Napumsaka, **4.** Kampaman, **5.** Jwaragrastha, **6.** Andha, **7.** Bala, **8.** Matta, **9.** Unmatta, **10.** Lulla, **11.** Langada, **12.** Kodhi, **13.** Bandhanabaddha, **14.** Paduka-pahana-huwa, **15.** Dhan-ka-kandan-karti-huwi, **16.** Pisati-huwi, **17.** Anaj-bhanjati-huwi, **18.** Charkha-kati-huwi, **19.** Kapas-lothi-huwi, **20.** Kapas-alag-karti-huwi, **21.** Rui-pijati-huwi, **22.** Anaj-adi-dalati-huwi, **23.** Dahi-ka-manthan-karti-huwi, **24.** Bhojan-karti-huwi, **25.** Garbhini, **26.** Balavatsa, **27.** Chha-kay-jiva-se-yukt-hath-wali, **28.** Chha-kay-jiva-ka-ghat-karti-huwi, **29.** Sambhavita-bhayavali.

Pindavishuddhiprakarana mentions 38 faults, but it does not mention the Abhoga and Anabhoga dayakas described in Pindaniyukti.

An-gar-dharma-amrita prohibits donors who are menstruating, pregnant, Aryikas of other sects, those carrying a corpse to the cremation ground, those in mourning for a deceased person, and eunuchs.

The 40 faults of the donor mentioned in Pindaniyukti are related to the first 25 individuals. In exceptional circumstances, one can accept alms from them. For example, accepting alms from a child under 8 years old is unacceptable, but if the child gives alms in the presence of their mother or guardian, a small amount can be accepted from their hand.

**7. Unmisra Dosha**

Accepting alms with a mixed mind is Unmisra Dosha. An-gar-dharma-amrita refers to this as Vimishra or Misra Dosha. According to Pindavishuddhiprakarana, giving alms by mixing eligible and ineligible items is Unmisra Dosha. Dashavaikalika mentions that if food, drink, Khadim, and Swadim, etc., are mixed with flowers, seeds, and greenery, it is unacceptable for a Bhakt-pan Sadhu. Mulachara also explains Unmisra Dosha in the same way.

Unmisra Dosha is mainly of three types: **1.** Sachitta, **2.** Achitta, **3.** Misra. These three...

## Pindianuyukti: An Observation

**115. In the last two Chaturbhangis out of the 115 Chaturbhangis, the first three alternatives are prohibited and the fourth alternative is to be worshipped. In the first Chaturbhangi, all four alternatives are prohibited for begging.**

**Like the Sanhrita Dvara, here also, one should understand the saamyogik bhang of Prithvikaaya etc. and the four alternatives of shushk and aadr should be known like the Sanharan dosha.**

**While explaining the difference between Unmisra and Sanhrita dosha, the author says that giving alms by mixing both kalpya and akalpya types of objects is Unmisra dosha, and collecting the non-deserving object from the bhajanastha and putting the kalpya object in it and giving alms is Sanhrita dosha.**

**8. Aparinat Dosha**

**To take an object which is not completely a-chitta or which the giver does not want to give is Aparinat dosha. In the Dashavaikalik Sutra, the word 'anivvud' is used for Aparinat.**

**According to the Digambar tradition, tilodak, tandulodak, ushnajal, chane ka dhovan, tushodak, if they are not completely a-chitta or other objects which are aparinat, taking them is Aparinat dosha. This is of two types - dravya aparinat and bhav aparinat.**

**From the perspective of the giver and the receiver, there are two types of each:**

**Dravya Vishayak Aparinat - This is of six types due to its relation with the Shatkayas. For example, conscious earth is aparinat as long as it is alive, and after becoming lifeless, it is called parinat. Similarly, one should know about Apkay etc.**

**Bhav Vishayak Aparinat - When an object is related to two or more people, one person wants to give it to the sadhu and the other person or others do not want to give it, then it is bhavatah aparinat from the giver's perspective. Similarly, if two munis go for alms and one muni considers the object to be eshaniya and the other does not consider it to be eshaniya, then it is bhavatah aparinat from the receiver's perspective, hence it is akalpya.**

**_The commentator Malayagiri has explained the difference between anisrusht and datribhav from aparinat. According to him, in anisrusht, the giver is generally indirect, but in datribhav from aparinat, the giver is present. Both of them disagree to give alms._**

**9. Lipta Dosha**

**Taking lepkrud substances increases the desire for taste, hence taking lepkrud substances like milk, curd etc. is Lipta dosha.**

##  Translation:

116. This is called **Piṇḍaniyukti**. The definition of **lipta dosa** in the Digambara tradition is slightly different. There, giving food with a hand or vessel that has come into contact with geru, harital, khaḍiya, manahsila, wet dough, or uncooked rice is considered **lipta dosa**. According to this definition, there is no difference between **prakshit dosa** and **lipta dosa**.

The definition of **lipta dosa** described in **Piṇḍaniyukti** is also thought-provoking because it discusses the faults that arise from the giver or householder at the time of begging, not the discussion of what kind of food a muni should or should not take. A detailed description of this is found in the **Dashavaikalika Sutra**. It seems likely that **lipta dosa** is mentioned because there is a high probability of **pashchatkarma** after consuming contaminated substances. The **niyuktikara** has presented a list of three types of substances: **alepakrid**, **alpalepakrid**, and **bahulepakrid**, and has clarified the subject through a question-and-answer session between the guru and the disciple. The author has presented eight options arising from the mutual combination of six things: **sansrusht hath**, **sansrusht patra**, **savasesh dravya**, and their opposites: **asansrusht hath**, **asansrusht patra**, and **niravasesh dravya**.

10. **Chardit dosa**

Giving alms by dropping the object is **chardit dosa**. The **Dashavaikalika Sutra** prohibits accepting such alms. In Digambara literature, this fault is called **parityaajana dosa** or **tyakt dosa**. In **Piṇḍaniyukti**, **chardana dosa** is related only to the householder giver, but in Digambara literature, this fault is explained in two forms. There, it is related to both the householder and the muni. Taking alms that the householder drops while giving, or dropping food while eating, or dropping one thing and eating another desired thing is **tyakt dosa** or **parityaajana dosa**. In **Anngardharmaamrit**, it is explained as **chhotit dosa**.

There are three types of **chardana dosa**: **sachitt**, **achitt**, and **mishra**. All the options of these four **bhangis** are prohibited. A sadhu who consumes food with **chardit dosa** incurs faults like **ajna**, **anavastha**, **mithyatva**, and **viradhana**.

The **niyuktikara**, explaining the reason for not accepting alms with **chardit dosa**, says that if the **achitt dravya** is hot, it can burn the giver when it falls to the ground, and it can cause **viradhana** to earth-bodied beings, etc. If cold **dravya** is **chardit**, then also **viradhana** of earth-bodied beings, etc., is possible. In this context, the **niyuktikara** has presented the example of **madhubindu**.

* In *Anudharmamrit*, the terms *Vimishra* and *Mishra* defects are mentioned instead of *Unmishra* defect.

**Paribhog Eshana: Ahar-Mandali**

The Agamas mention seven mandalis (communities) of the Muni's communal life, one of which is the Ahar-Mandali. The Sadhu consumes the received food in two ways: 1. In the Mandali, 2. Alone. In *Oghanuyukti*, it is mentioned that the Sadhus who eat in the Mandali gather together and eat after waiting for each other. There are some *Samuddishak* in each Mandali, who do not go for alms themselves but eat in the Mandali, such as the very ill, children, the elderly, the Acharya, etc. - these are unable to bring alms. The reason is that the *Shaiksh* does not know the alms-giving method, the guest and the Guru are not sent for alms due to respect, the *Asahuvarg* i.e. the prince, etc. Muni cannot go for alms due to his delicate nature, and the *Alabhidhari* Muni, who do not get food easily due to *Antaray* karma, also eat in the Mandali. No one *Upgrah* (attends) on all of them, the work is done with the cooperation of all. This can be included in the defect mentioned in the following verses:

1. **Moola 462**
2. **Anudharmamrit 5/281**
3. **Dasha Vaikalik Sutra** mentions the defects of *eshana* in a scattered form. The defect is not mentioned by the name *Lipt*, but it is related to *Purahkarma* and *Paschatkarma*.

## Pinḍa Niyukti

The subject of research is why the Pinḍaniryuktikār did not use the word "Mandali"? Digambara tradition sadhus go alone for alms. They are pāṇipātra, and in the house where the muni's abhigraha are complete, they receive alms free from 14 malas and 32 antarāyas. They stand and take alms only once a day. For Śvetāmbara sadhus, the instruction is to bring alms in a wooden vessel and eat at their own place. After bringing the alms, the muni should rest for a moment so that the fatigue and disturbance of the metals are calmed. During the time of rest, in kāyoatsarga, he should contemplate that if the ācārya or muni blesses the food brought by me, I will be blessed, I will be fortunate, and I will believe that they have saved me from the ocean of existence. After contemplation, he should request the ācārya to give the food brought by me to a guest, ascetic, sick, elderly, or student. Whether they accept that invitation or not, the result is that the mind of the one who gives the invitation is purified and there is abundant nirjarā, and the benefit of knowledge etc. is obtained. In Āgama literature, great emphasis is placed on the division of the food received. One who does not divide cannot be eligible for liberation. If the muni hides the food from other things due to greed while taking food, then due to this taste and lust, he binds himself with dense karmas. Due to the lack of self-satisfaction, liberation also becomes rare for him.

Ācārya Tilaka has explained this in two different meanings by considering bhikṣācārya as two words. The first word 'bhikṣā' is accepted in the context of bringing pure eṣaṇīya alms by going around, and the second word 'cārya' is accepted in the sense of eating. Anyway, the root 'car' is also used in the sense of eating, so the faults that occur during the time of paribhoga-iṣaṇā also come under bhikṣācārya. These are also called grāsa-iṣaṇā or māṇḍalika faults. Even after taking pure food from the source and production, if there is no discretion or non-attachment during consumption, then that pure food also becomes tainted with faults. In the Daśavaikalika Sutra, it is said that the muni should eat whatever food is available, whether it is bitter, pungent, astringent, sour-sweet, or salty, like honey and ghee. He should eat for the proper carrying of the burden of restraint, like applying ointment on a wound and massage on a chariot wheel, not for taste or attachment. In the Āgamas, it is mentioned that the muni should not move the food from the left molar to the right molar for the sake of taste. Just as a snake enters a hole straight, so too, with a non-attached attitude, he should swallow the food down his throat.

1. According to Daśa 5/1/93, Oghanīyukti Bhāṣya (274), after bringing the alms, the muni should chant the Namaskāra Mahāmantra for 8 breaths.

## Pinḍaniryukti: An Observation

**Method of Consumption**

The **Oghaniryukti** and its commentary present a psychological, practical, and poignant discussion regarding the acceptance of food from a vessel and its placement in the mouth for consumption. The text vividly describes the mindset of the eater through the analogy of animals. The **Oghaniryukti** uses the example of a crow and a jackal to illustrate improper consumption. Just as a crow eats grains hidden in dung, scattering the rest and looking around while eating, similarly, consuming food with relish, dropping food, or looking around in another's vessel while eating is considered improper. The jackal eats different parts of its food, not in order, similarly, if rice is mixed with fragrant ghee, drinking the ghee and leaving the rice is improper consumption. Consuming superior and inferior substances together is considered proper. Eating one's food in pieces, like a lion, is considered proper consumption. A monk who eats improperly is given **Kalyanak** atonement by the **Acharya** to prevent the repetition of such an act.

The method of placing food in the mouth, as described in the **Bhagawti Sutra**, is also found in the **Oghaniryukti** commentary. When placing food in the mouth, if there is excessive chili, the monk should not make a "snorting" sound. While chewing, the monk should not make a "smacking" sound. The monk should not eat too quickly or too slowly. While eating, the monk should not drop food. The **Dashavaikalik Sutra** mentions "**Jayam Aparisaḍayam**", which points to this very aspect. After eating, the monk should wipe any food residue from the vessel with their finger and eat it. Whether the substance is fragrant or foul, the monk should not leave even a small portion uneaten. The **Oghaniryukti** also emphasizes the use of appropriate qualities of mind, speech, and body. This means that while eating, the monk should not have distorted thoughts, should not express reactions to the food through speech, and should not express through their body that they would not eat such distorted food. This way, the eater achieves purity in consumption.

**Consumption Craving or Māṇḍalik Dosha**

The **Pinḍaniryukti** refers to the poignant story of a fisherman and a fish in the context of **dravya grāsaishana** (craving for food). In this story, the fish tells the fisherman its story from its own mouth. The fish says that it escaped the mouth of a **balaka** (a type of bird) three times. It also escaped the fisherman's net twenty-one times with skill. Even when caught in the net, it escaped the fisherman's grasp while being threaded through the net.

## Pindaniyukti

It is your shamelessness that you want to catch me, who am full of power. This example is found in the Jitakalp Bhashya and the Malayagiri commentary on Pindaniyukti. Here, the sage is like a fish, the flesh is the local devotee's drink, and the fisherman is the local attachment and aversion. Just as the fish was not caught even by many means, so too should the sage practice self-discipline and think that when I was not deceived by the 42 faults of begging, then my soul should not be deceived by attachment and aversion during the time of eating and drinking. To inspire oneself with this feeling is **Bhavagrasaeshanā**. This resolve keeps the sage detached and neutral even in the presence of favorable and unfavorable food.

In the present context, it would not be irrelevant to present the fourfold truth of the world and the non-world as specified in **Oghanuyukti**. The monk who resolves that I will eat coarse and fine food, if he eats the same food at the time of eating, then he is **Sasar Upavishta** and **Sasar Uthitha**, that is, he enters the food assembly with auspicious results and eats the same food with auspicious results, this is the first **Bhang**. In the second **Bhang**, the monk enters the food assembly with auspicious resolve but due to degenerate results, he is unable to remain detached from eating, therefore he is **Sasar Upavishta** and **Asar Uthitha**. In the third **Bhang**, he enters with attached results at the time of eating but eats coarse and fine food in small quantities while eating, he is **Asar Upavishta** and **Sasar Uthitha**, and the fourth type of sage is **Asar Upavishta** and **Asar Uthitha**, he is attached in both ways and has weak willpower. Here, the **Niyuktikar** has also given the example of a sea merchant who took his ship loaded with goods and returned loaded with gold, silver, etc., that is, he went to the world and returned to the world, similarly, one should understand the other **Bhangs** of the fourfold truth.

In **Pindaniyukti**, where the five faults of **Grasaeshanā** are mentioned, the word **Atibahuk** is used in place of **Pramanatireka** and the word **Anarth** (without purpose) is used in place of the fault of **Karan**. In **Anugardharmamrut**, only three faults are mentioned in addition to the fault of **Karan**, there is also a difference in the order of the faults.

In the **Bhagavati Sutra**, the faults of **Angar** etc. are not mentioned as **Grasaeshanā** or **Mandalik** faults.

1. **Jibha 1606, Mavru P. 171.** The sage who shows aversion towards food is **Asar** because his perspective is devoid of knowledge, faith, and conduct.
2. **Oni 544, 545, Pini 302/5, Jibha 1607, 1608.** The sage who takes ordinary food without attachment and aversion with a mind free from the faults of **Udgam**, **Utpādana**, and **Eshanā** is **Sasar** because his perspective is filled with knowledge, faith, and conduct.
3. **Oni 567-70.**
4. **Oni 571, 572, T P. 187, 188.**
5. **Pini 303/1; Sanjoyanamibahuya, Ingal Sadhumgam Anattae.**
6. **Anudh 5/37.**

## Pindianiyukti: An Observation

**121** There is a general description of Angar, Dhum and Samyoga in the context of food in the seventh century. After that, there is a description of the Pramanatikrant dosha along with Kshetratikrant, Kalatikrant and Margattikrant related to food and water. There is no mention of the Karan dosha. From this context, it can be inferred that these had not developed as Grasaishana or Mandalik doshas until the composition of the Bhagavati Sutra. 

**Samyoga**
Combining other food items with edible and palatable food items to enhance taste and juice is the Samyoga dosha. Samyoga is of two types - external and internal.

Combining suitable substances in a household item is external Samyoga, and the combination done while eating in an Upashraya is internal Samyoga. This is done in three ways - in the vessel, in the Kavala, and in the mouth. In Panchvastu, only two types of internal Samyoga are mentioned - in the vessel and in the mouth.

Since Pindianiyukti describes food and Bhikchacharya, it only describes Samyoga related to food and drink, but Pravachansaroaddhar also mentions external and internal Samyoga related to equipment. The commentator, while explaining external Samyoga related to equipment, says that if a Sadhu gets a beautiful Cholapatt from somewhere, he wears a new Pachevadi for adornment outside the residence, that is external Samyoga related to equipment. If he does so inside the residence, it is internal equipment Samyoga.

Mixing ghee or chili-spices etc. with the item kept in the vessel is vessel-related Samyoga. Mixing sugar or other substances in the Kavala held in the hand to enhance its taste is Kavala-related Samyoga, and putting another substance in the mouth after taking the Kavala in the mouth to enhance its taste is mouth-related Samyoga. A Muni who does Samyoga due to attachment and taste, combines karma with his soul due to the cause of raga-dvesha. The combination of karma leads to infinite suffering.

**Exceptions to Samyoga Dosha**
The Niyuktikar states that if there is leftover food after eating enough, then Samyoga is allowed to consume the leftover food. For example, it is not possible to eat leftover ghee without bread and sugar after being satisfied with food, its Paristapan...

**3. Pini 305, Jibha 1613**
**4. Panv 359**
**5. Pini 305, Mavru P. 172, Bribhati P. 239**
**6. Pini 307, Jibha 1616, 1617**

Page #136:
---------------------------
## Translation:

122.  The practice of *pindiya* (offering food to deities) is not appropriate because it can lead to the harm of many creatures like ants. Therefore, it is prescribed to mix leftover food with sugar, etc. Similarly, for those who find food unpalatable, for princes and other virtuous individuals, and for those who are not yet fully initiated into the Jain way of life, mixing food is prescribed. This is an example of the fallacy of *pramanatirek* (excessive proof).

For a monk, Mahavira used a specific term - *mayanna* - meaning one who knows the right measure of food. Food that does not harm *dhriti* (mental health), *bala* (physical strength), and *sanjama* (self-control) in the present and future is considered *pramanayukta* (measured) food.  Eating more than this is harmful for a monk. Eating excessively more than three times due to attachment or dissatisfaction is the fault of *pramanatirek*. According to the Bhagavati Sutra, eating more than 32 *kavala* (mouthfuls) is considered *pramanatikrant* (excessive) food.

The *niyuktikara* (commentator) and *bhashyakara* (interpreter) have considered *hita* (beneficial), *mita* (moderate), and *alpa* (minimal) food as *pramanayukta* food. The *bhashyakara* has presented a fourfold classification of beneficial food, connecting it to this world and the next:

* Beneficial in this world, not in the next.
* Beneficial in the next world, not in this.
* Beneficial in this world and the next.
* Not beneficial in this world or the next.

Eating *aneshaniya* (non-essential) foods like *kheer* (rice pudding), *dahi* (yogurt), and *gud* (jaggery) with attachment and aversion is beneficial in this world but not in the next. Eating pure food with *eshana* (effort) but without *manojna* (pleasantness) is beneficial for the next world but not for this. Eating food that is both *pathya* (wholesome) and pure with *eshana* is beneficial for both worlds. Eating *apathya* (unwholesome) and *aneshaniya* food with attachment and aversion is harmful for both this world and the next.

The *niyuktikara* has scientifically explained *mita* (moderate) food. Generally, a person should imagine their stomach divided into six parts, three parts for food, two parts for water, and the sixth part empty for air circulation.

Page #137:
---------------------------
## Pinḍaniyukti: An Observation

**123.** According to the texts of Mūlācāra and Āyurveda, the abdomen is divided into four parts, two parts for food, one part for water, and the fourth part is kept empty for air circulation. 

**1.** The practitioner of Pinḍaniyukti has also given instructions on the amount of food according to the season. In winter, one part is allotted for water and four parts for food. In moderate winter, two parts for water and three parts for food, in summer, two parts for water and three parts for food, and in extreme summer, three parts for water and two parts for food. The sixth part is always reserved for air circulation. 

**2.** One part of water and two parts of food are constant, they do not increase or decrease. In extreme summer, two parts of water increase, and in extreme winter, two parts of food increase. This means that in extreme summer, two parts of food decrease, and in extreme winter, two parts of water decrease. 

**3.** The third and fourth parts out of the six parts are unstable. The fifth part related to water, the sixth part related to air, and the first and second parts related to food - these four parts are present. 

**4.** By this method, keeping the stomach empty for air and water is considered moderate eating. Eating less than this is considered minimal eating. 

**5.** The excess of food (Pramaṇātireka) occurs in five ways. Prakāma āhāra is the first type of excess food. The Uttarādhyayana Sutra mentions that just as a fire in a forest with abundant fuel and strong wind does not extinguish quickly, similarly, the digestive fire of a person who eats excessively (Prakāmabhōji) never calms down. 

**6.** For men, 32 kavala is the prescribed amount of food, and for women, 28 kavala. For eunuchs, 24 kavala is the prescribed amount. Eating more than this is considered Prakāma āhāra. 

**7.** The Vyavahāra Bhāṣya considers 32 kavala as Prakāma āhāra. There, the amount of kavala is explained practically and intelligibly. According to it, one should know the amount of the abdomen (kukkuḍi-udara-pramaṇam) as the 32nd part of one's own food intake. 

**8.** Another alternative meaning is found in the commentary of Śāntyācārya. The meaning of "aṇḍaka" is the mouth. The amount of food that can be put into the mouth without distorting it naturally is the prescribed kavala. 

**9.** The Harivamśa Purāṇa, while describing the kavala-pramaṇam, states that one thousand grains of rice are equal to one kavala. 

**10.** The size of an āṁvala (Indian gooseberry) is also mentioned for kavala-pramaṇam. However, everyone's body structure and digestive power are not the same.

**Pindaniyukti** occurs. The amount of food also varies based on physical and mental labor. **Nikam Aahar** - consuming more food than the daily requirement is **Nikam Aahar**. According to Manusmriti, excessive food hinders health and longevity, obstructs attaining heaven and merit, and increases animosity in this world. **Pranit Aahar** - heavy or excessively oily food is called **Pranit Aahar**, such as Ghevar, Sneha Prakshit Mandak, etc. Excessive **Pranit Rasa**-rich food excites and destroys a person just like birds destroy a sweet fruit-bearing tree. **Atibahuk Aahar** - consuming much more food than one's hunger is **Atibahuk**. **Atibahush Aahar** - eating multiple times a day or more than three times is **Atibahush**. **S-Angar Dosha**

Consuming food praising water with **Raga**, **Aasakti**, **Grdhi**, and **Moorcheha** is **Angar Dosha**. Just as coal becomes **Angara** after burning without smoke from fire, similarly, the **Raga** fueled fire burns the character regularly like **Angara**, this is **Angar Dosha**. The author says that even **Prasook Aahar** consumed due to **Aasakti** burns the character. 
**S-Dhoom Dosha**

Criticizing bland or unpleasant food and consuming it due to hatred, anger, or distress is **Dhoom Dosha**. Just as a painting contaminated with smoke does not look beautiful, similarly, a character tainted with **Dhoom Dosha** does not look beautiful. The burning fire of hatred keeps burning with the smoke of displeasure, making the character dull until it becomes like **Angara**. 
**Karan Dosha**

Eating for taste is forbidden for a Muni. According to **Moolachar**, a Muni should eat not for strength, longevity, or increase in energy, but for the practice of knowledge, restraint, and meditation. Consuming food without the six reasons like hunger, etc., is **Karan Dosha**, and when the six reasons for abandoning food are present,

---------------------------
## Pindianiyukti: An Observation

**125. Not abandoning food is also a cause-defect.** The *Anugardharmamrita* does not mention cause-defect. In *Pindianiyukti*, six purposes of food are specified for the Muni:

1. **Vedana-Kshudha:** There is no greater pain than hunger, therefore, food should be taken to alleviate it.
2. **Vaiyavrutya:** A hungry person cannot serve, therefore, food should be taken for the proper service of the sick, elderly, ascetics, etc.
3. **Iryapatha-Shuddhi:** A hungry person cannot be aware of the Iryapatha, therefore, food should be taken to properly perform the Iryapatha and the six essentials.
4. **Samyama-Preksha:** Food should be taken for the proper observance of Samyama, contemplation, etc.
5. **Pranapratyay:** Without food, physical strength weakens, therefore, food should be taken to sustain life.
6. **Dharmachintan:** In a state of no food, the Sadhu is not able to use knowledge-reflection, contemplation, etc., therefore, food should be taken.

**Reasons for not eating:**

Similar to the six reasons for eating, the Agamas mention six reasons for not eating. The *Pindianiyukti* mentions the same reasons that are also indicated in the *Uttaraadhyayayana*, *Sthananga*, etc.:

1. **Atanka:** In case of sudden illness like fever, etc., to prevent it.
2. **Upsarga-Titiksha:** In case of an attack by a king, etc.
3. **Brahmacharya-Suraksha:** To protect the nine secrets of Brahmacharya.
4. **Pranidaya:** To show compassion towards living beings in rain, dew, etc.
5. **Tap:** For fasting, etc., up to the Paunmasik Tap.
6. **Sharira-Vyutsarga:** To shed the body, for Sanlekhana or fatal fasting.

**Other defects of Paribhogaishana:**

The *Bhagavati Sutra* prohibits the consumption of food that is *Kshetratrikrant*, *Kalatrikrant*, and *Margatrikrant* in the context of the Muni's diet. There, consuming food before sunrise and then consuming it after sunrise is a *Kshetratrikrant* defect. Consuming food taken in the first watch in the last watch is a *Kalatrikrant* defect.

**Note:** The *Brihatkalpa*, *Nishitha*, etc., and their commentaries use only the terms *Kalatrikrant* and *Kshetratrikrant*, the term *Margatrikrant* is not used there. The interpretation of the term *Kshetratrikrant* in the *Bhagavati* is debatable because it relates to time, not place. In this context, the commentator Abhaydeva Suri and Acharya Mahaprajna have discussed it in detail in the *Bhagavati Bhashya Bha. 2 p. 336*.

Page #140:
---------------------------
## Translation:

126.  
**Kalaatikrant** is a fault committed when the time for consuming the food offered (**pindaniyukti**) has passed. A sadhu can consume the food until the third prahar (time period). After that, the food becomes unfit for consumption due to **kalaatikrant** and needs to be **parishthapit** (disposed of).  

**Margatikrant** is a fault committed when the food is consumed more than half a yojana (two kos) away from the place where it was offered.  

Consuming **kshetrattikrant** food results in a **chaar guru** (four guru) penance. This also leads to other faults like **aagyaabhang** (disobedience), **sanyamviraadhana** (violation of restraint), etc. The faults arising from consuming **kshetrattikrant** food are discussed in detail in the **bhaashya** literature.

**Changes in the Rules of Bhikshaacharya**

From Mahavira to the present day, it is a subject of historical research to understand the changes in the rules of **bhikshaacharya** (begging for food). How many rules have been **kritkrit** (abolished) and how many new rules have been established?  

Reading about **pindaniyukti** clearly shows that the sadhu's **aachaar-sanhita** (code of conduct) has changed significantly over time, depending on **dravya** (substance), **kshetra** (place), **kaal** (time), and **bhaav** (emotion).  

The seven-day **vishramana** (rest) period for a sadhu before washing clothes is unimaginable today, and such circumstances no longer exist. For example, consider the rule regarding how many times a muni should go out for **bhiksha** (begging) in a day. The tradition until **Uttaraadhyaayana** states that a muni should go out for **bhiksha** in the third prahar of the day, as the muni was only allowed to eat once a day. The **Dashavaikalik Sutra**, which is a representative text on muni conduct, does not mention this. While it mentions "**egabhattam cha bhoyanam**" (eating once a day), it is possible that Muni Manak, the son of Shayambhav, who was very young at the time, may have established a different time for **bhiksha** for educational purposes as an exception. This could also be the reason why there is no mention of this in the **Dashavaikalik Sutra**.  

Generally, a sadhu cannot eat at a householder's home. However, the statement mentioned in **Dashavaikalik 5/1/82, 83** suggests that a sadhu can eat in a place that is covered from above, enclosed on all sides, and suitable for eating, if they wish to do so while begging. It is a subject of historical research to understand why Acharya Shayambhav established this rule.

According to the **vyakhya** literature, a muni should not go out for **bhiksha** alone but with two other munis. The following **upsarg** (adverse circumstances) can arise for a muni who goes out alone: **stree janit upsarg** (adverse circumstances caused by women), **pasu janit upsarg** (adverse circumstances caused by animals).

127

**Counterproductive Practices:**  Such as the use of prefixes, the non-purification of alms, and the undermining of great vows.

**Oghanīyukti** explains the psychological reasons for a monk going for alms alone:
* One who is proud of their gains.
* One who starts preaching in a householder's home (and therefore no one wants to go with them).
* One who is deceitful, lazy, and fond of pleasure.
* One who desires to consume non-prescribed food.
* During a famine, when alms are scarce.

However, currently, nuns go for alms in pairs, and monks go alone. The question of when, how, and why this change in the rules of alms-seeking occurred, and what its background was, is a subject for independent research.

**Physical and Mental State During Alms-Seeking**

It is not enough to simply avoid the 42 faults while going for alms and receiving alms. The fifth study of the Dashavaikalika mentions many other small details. Acharya Haribhadra clearly states that only a monk who follows the rules of *īryāsamiti*, the avoidance of greenery, etc., can seek pure food. The Dashavaikalika Sutra presents a psychological portrait of how a monk should be physically and mentally during alms-seeking.

The mind of a monk going for alms should be free from anxiety and distractions. A monk who is mentally hurried cannot purify *īryāsamiti* nor be aware of *eṣaṇāsamiti*. Therefore, the monk should seek food with a clear mind, free from anxiety.

The monk should not only be free from fainting while eating but also while seeking alms. If the mind is faint and attached during alms-seeking, then pure food cannot be sought. The author of the *niyukti* gives the example of a calf. Even if a merchant's daughter offers food to the calf adorned and decorated, the calf remains focused only on eating its food. It does not pay attention to the woman's form, color, or adornment. Similarly, the monk should seek food while remaining free from attachment to sensory objects.

Another interpretation is that just as a cow grazes without distinguishing between good and bad grass, so too should the monk accept alms from all families without distinction.

1. Oṇi 412;
*Ekaṇiyassā dosā, itthī sāṇe taheva paḍiṇīe. Bhikṣavisohi mahavvay tamhā sabitijjaye gamaṇam.*

## 128

**Pinḍaniyukti:** While walking, a Muni's gaze should be fixed on the ground, according to the measure of their body. "Yug" means the ground according to the measure of the body. Explaining "Yug-pramāṇa," Ācārya Mahāprajña says that if the gaze is cast too far, then subtle-bodied beings will not be visible. If the gaze is kept too close, then it will not be possible to avoid beings that suddenly come underfoot. Therefore, the instruction is given to walk while looking at the area according to the measure of the body.

If the Muni does not perform Pratikramaṇa for the fault committed during the time of begging, then they will receive the Masalghu (Purimārḍha) Prāyaścitta.

**Muni Life:** Every substance is requested in Muni life. Even a piece of grass is not unrequested. Therefore, the Muni should accept alms with a submissive mind. They should not feel sorrow if they receive alms or not. In this context, the Dasavaikalika Sutra, while cleansing the mind of the Sadhu, says that there may be many pleasing and delicious food items in the house of a householder. Even if the food is visible, if the householder does not give it to the Muni, the Muni should not show anger or displeasure. At that time, the Muni should think that it is their wish to give or not give. Even if the giver gives little, they should not criticize them. To protect their self-respect and self-esteem, they should keep in mind that if other begging monks have already entered the house of a householder, they should not enter that house for alms.

**Prāyaścitta for Faults in Bhikṣācāryā:**

Bhagavān Mahāvīra gave great importance to Prāyaścitta, which is why independent texts in the form of Chhed Sutras were created. For mistakes or offenses, Mahāvīra did not prescribe punishment but Prāyaścitta, because in this, the individual themselves accepts the mistake and takes Prāyaścitta from the Guru. Punishment and law do not involve remorse or a change of heart.

The Chhed Sutras mention the Prāyaścitta for faults committed by the Sadhu during Bhikṣācāryā in a scattered manner. In the situation of Asantharaṇa, the Niśītha Bhāṣyakāra has presented an alternative: the 42 faults of Bhikṣācāryā should be written on the heart-plate with the ink of Śruta-jñāna, and the one with the least Prāyaścitta should be taken. The least Prāyaścitta is Paṇaga (Nirvigaya), and the most is four Guru (fasting).

**Detailed and Ordered Description of Prāyaścitta for Faults Committed in Bhikṣācāryā in the Jītakalpa Bhāṣya:**

1. Daś 5/1/3: The fifth Piṇḍaiṣaṇa study of the Dasavaikalika instructs on many points to be kept in mind while walking and begging.
2. U 2/28: Everything is obtained, nothing is unobtainable.
3. Daś 5/2/26-28.
4. Daś 5/2/12, 13.

**129**

There is a mention of the atonement-method in a symbolic form in the *Bṛhatkalpabhāṣya* as well, albeit very briefly. The *Niśīthabhāṣya* also describes atonements in some places. The commentary on the *Piṇḍaviśuddhiprakaraṇa* mentions the atonements for faults related to begging in a classified form, collectively. There, the *mūlakarma* is considered the most serious.

Jain Ācāryas have mentioned four *guru*, four *laghu*, *gurumās*, *laghumās*, and *paṇa* etc. atonements symbolically, which the *muni* who performs the atonement carries out in the form of *tapa*. Here, the atonement-method related to all faults related to begging is being described.

**Ādhākarma:** An atonement of four *guru* is incurred upon taking *ādhākarma* food. Its *tapa* form of atonement is fasting.

**Auddeśika:** The different types of *auddeśika* and its atonement are being presented through a chart.

**Auddeśika**

| **Uddesa (Māsaguru)** | **Ādeśa** | **Samādeśa** | **Uddesa** | **Samuddeśa** | **Ogh** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| (Māsaguru) | (Māsalaghu) | (Māsalaghu) | (Māsalaghu) | (Māsalaghu) | (Māsalaghu) |

The commentator, while presenting these penances as forms of austerity, states that the latter half of a small month (Purīmārdha), one day of a large month (Ekāśana), four small months (Āyambila), and four large months (Upavās) are penances. In the two categories of Pūtikarma, the penance for Upakaraṇa-Pūti is Māsalagha (Purīmārdha), and the penance for Bhaktapāna-Pūti is Māsaguru (Ekāśana). In the three categories of Miśrajāta-Doṣa, the penance for the first, Yāvadārthika Miśra, is four small months (Āyambila), and the penance for Pākhaṇḍimiśra and Sādhumiśra is four large months (Upavās). There are two types of Sthāpanā-Doṣa: Itvarīka Sthāpita and Cira Sthāpita. The penance for Itvarīka Sthāpita is Paṇaga (five days and nights, Nirvigaya), and the penance for Cira Sthāpita is Māsalagha (Purīmārdha). The penance for Sūkṣma Prābhṛtika-Doṣa is Laghapaṇaga (Nirvigaya), and the penance for Bādra Prābhṛtika-Doṣa is four large months (Upavās). In the category of Prāduṣkaraṇa-Doṣa, the penance for Prakāṭakaraṇa, i.e., bringing something out of a dark place into the light, is Māsalagha (Purīmārdha), and the penance for illuminating it with a lamp, etc., is four small months (Āyambila). There are four types of Krītakṛta-Doṣa: 1. Ātmadravya-Krīta, 2. Ātmabhava-Krīta, 3. Paradravya-Krīta, 4. Parabhava-Krīta. The penance for Ātmadravya-Krīta, Paradravya-Krīta, and Ātmabhava-Krīta is four small months (Āyambila), and the penance for Parabhava-Krīta is Māsalagha (Purīmārdha). The penance for Laukika Prāmitya-Doṣa is four small months (Āyambila), and the penance for Lokottara Prāmitya-Doṣa is Māsalagha (Purīmārdha). The penance for Laukika Parivartita-Doṣa is four small months (Āyambila), and the penance for Lokottara Doṣa is Māsalagha (Purīmārdha). The penance for Svagrāma Anācīrṇa Abhyāhata-Doṣa is Māsalagha (Purīmārdha). Paragrāma Abhyāhata is of two types: Jalapatha and Sthalapatha. In this, there is the possibility of Ātma-Virādhanā and Samyama-Virādhanā in the path with many obstacles, therefore, the penance for Abhyāhata in a path with many obstacles is four large months (Upavās).

## Pinḍaniyukti: An Observation

**133** The **Shankita Doṣa-Jītakalpabhāṣya** does not indicate the **prāyaścitta** (penance) for **Shankita Doṣa** (doubtful fault). In **Prakṣita Doṣa** (observed fault) and **Mrakṣita Doṣa** (touched fault), taking alms with a hand touched by **Pṛthvīkāya** (earth element) results in **Paṇaga** (Nirvigaya), taking alms with a hand mixed with **Kardama** (mud) results in **Laghumāsa** (Pūrimārḍha), and taking alms with a hand touched by dry **Pṛthvīkāya** results in **Cāralagha** (Āyambila) **prāyaścitta**.

Taking alms with a **Sasnigdha** (oily) and **Sarajaska** (moist) hand and vessel results in **Paṇaga** (Nirvigaya), and taking alms with a **Ārdra** (wet) hand and vessel results in **Māsalagha** (Pūrimārḍha) **prāyaścitta**.

In **Mrakṣita Doṣa**, if **Puraḥkarma** (prior action) and **Paścātkarma** (posterior action) faults occur, **Cāralagha** (Āyambila) **prāyaścitta** is incurred. Some **Ācāryas** also mention **Māsalagha** (Pūrimārḍha) **prāyaścitta** in this case.

In **Mekṣita Doṣa** (touched fault), taking alms with a hand touched by **Paritta Vanaspatikāya** (limited plant element) results in **Māsalagha** (Pūrimārḍha), taking alms with a hand touched by **Anantakaaya Vanaspatikāya** (infinite plant element) results in **Māsaguru** (Ekāsana) **prāyaścitta**. Taking alms with a hand touched by a mixture of all plants results in **Māsalagha** (Pūrimārḍha) **prāyaścitta**. Taking alms with a hand or vessel touched by **Garhita Mala** (excrement) etc., and taking alms with a hand or vessel touched by **Gorasa** (juice) and **Jīva** (living beings) results in **Cāralagha** (Āyambila) **prāyaścitta**.

In **Nikkṣipta Doṣa** (deposited fault), taking alms with **Anantara Nikkṣipta Doṣa** (immediately deposited fault) from **Saccitta Pṛthvīkāya** (conscious earth element) to **Trasakāya** (three elements) excluding **Anantakaaya Vanaspatikāya** (infinite plant element) results in **Cāralagha** (Āyambila), and taking alms with **Parampara Nikkṣipta Doṣa** (consecutively deposited fault) results in **Māsalagha** (Pūrimārḍha) **prāyaścitta**. In **Miśra Pṛthvīkāya** (mixed earth element), taking alms with **Anantara Nikkṣipta Doṣa** results in **Māsalagha** (Pūrimārḍha), and taking alms with **Parampara Nikkṣipta Doṣa** results in **Paṇaga** (Nirvigaya) **prāyaścitta**. Taking alms with **Anantara Nikkṣipta Doṣa** on **Anantakaaya Vanaspati** (infinite plant element) results in **Cāraguru** (Upvāsa), and taking alms with **Parampara Nikkṣipta Doṣa** on **Anantakaaya** results in **Māsaguru** (Ekāsana) **prāyaścitta**.

The **Bṛhatkalpabhāṣya** and its commentary provide a detailed description of the **prāyaścitta** for **Nikkṣipta Doṣa**. Taking food with **Anantara** and **Parampara Nikkṣipta Doṣa** on each **Miśra Vanaspati** (mixed plant) results in **Māsalagha** (Pūrimārḍha), taking food with **Anantara** and **Parampara Nikkṣipta Doṣa** on the seed of each plant results in **Paṇaga** (Nirvigaya), and taking food with **Anantara** and **Parampara Nikkṣipta Doṣa** on **Ananta Vanaspati** (infinite plant) results in **Māsalagha** (Pūrimārḍha).

##  Chapter 134:  Pindaniyukti

**On taking food deposited on a seed, four Guru (fasting) is obtained. On taking food deposited on an infinite mixed plant, Anantar and Paramar, the penance of Masaguru (Ekasana) is obtained. According to other Acharyas, due to a difference in tradition, on taking food deposited on each mixed plant, Anantar and Paramar, Panag (Nirvigaya) is obtained, and on taking food deposited on an infinite mixed plant, Anantar and Paramar, Guru-mas (Ekasana) is obtained. On taking food deposited Anantar on each plant with awareness, four Laghu (Ayambil) is obtained, on taking food deposited Paramar, Maslaghu (Purimarth) is obtained, and on taking food deposited Anantar on each mixed plant, Maslaghu (Purimarth) is obtained, on taking food deposited Paramar, Panag (Nirvigaya) is obtained, on taking food deposited Anantar on an infinite-bodied plant, Masaguru (Ekasana) is obtained, and on taking food deposited Paramar, Panag (Nirvigaya) is obtained. On taking food deposited Anantar on a three-bodied plant, four Laghu (Ayambil) is obtained, and on taking food deposited Paramar, Maslaghu (Purimarth) is obtained. On taking food deposited Anantar and Paramar on an infinite-bodied plant with a hidden fault, Guru Panag (Nirvigaya) is obtained, and on taking food deposited Anantar and Paramar on each plant with a hidden fault, Laghu Panag (Nirvigaya) is obtained. The penance for a hidden fault should be understood like the penance for a deposited fault, starting from the earth-bodied plant. If there is self-contradiction, then the penance of four Guru-mas (fasting) is obtained. According to Brihatkalpabhashya, even if there is no awareness, on taking food deposited from a heavy substance, the penance of four Guru (fasting) is obtained. The penance for a collected fault is like the penance for a deposited fault. On collecting a substance with awareness, four Laghu (Ayambil) is obtained. Although it is inconceivable to take food from the hands of prohibited givers, the order of the penance method for taking food from them without reason is as follows: On taking food from the hands of a child, an old person, a drunkard, a madman, a trembling person, a feverish person, Maslaghu (Purimarth) is obtained, and on taking food from the hands of a blind person, a leper, a person wearing shoes and handcuffs, a person disabled in hands and feet, a eunuch, a pregnant woman, and a person with a child, the penance of four Guru (fasting) is obtained. On taking food from the hands of a woman who has eaten, bathed, and washed, four Laghu (Ayambil) is obtained. On taking food from the hands of a woman who is collecting chickpeas, etc., grinding, pounding, cooking, grinding, kneading, spinning cotton, and killing living beings, the penance of four Laghu (Ayambil) is obtained.

Taking alms from a woman who is menstruating, or whose hands are stained with the six substances of the body, attracts different penances. However, generally, the penance for these is **Cāralghu (Āyambil)**. There are some differences in the penances for the **Dāyaka Doṣa** mentioned in the commentary of the **Bṛhatkalpa**. There, taking alms from a leper or a eunuch attracts **Cāraguru (Upavās)**, while taking food from the hands of a woman who is menstruating, cutting, or grinding, attracts **Māsalghu (Pūrimārḍha)**. Taking alms from the hands of other prohibited givers attracts **Cāralghu (Āyambil)**.

**Umiśra Doṣa** - The **Jītakalpabhāṣya** does not mention the penance for **Umiśra Doṣa**. According to the **Bṛhatkalpabhāṣya**, taking **Umiśra** food with conscious intention from an infinite source attracts **Cāraguru (Upavās)**, taking mixed infinite **Umiśra** attracts **Māsaguru (Ekāsana)**, taking **Umiśra** with conscious intention from each body plant attracts **Cāralghu (Āyambil)**, and taking mixed **Umiśra** from each plant attracts **Māsalghu (Pūrimārḍha)**. Taking **Umiśra** food from the seeds of each plant and infinite body plants attracts **Paṇanga (Nirvigaya)** penance.

**Apariṇata Doṣa** - Taking **Apariṇata** with intention attracts **Māsalghu (Pūrimārḍha)** penance. The **Bṛhatkalpabhāṣya** also describes the penance for **Apariṇata** in terms of substance. Taking earth, etc., as **Apariṇata** (with conscious intention) attracts **Cāralghu (Āyambil)**, and taking infinite body **Apariṇata** attracts **Cāraguru (Upavās)** penance.

**Lipta Doṣa** - Taking alms from a vessel or hand that is stained attracts **Cāralghu (Āyambil)**, and taking alms from a vessel that is partially stained attracts **Lghumās (Pūrimārḍha)** penance.

According to the commentator, the first three stages of **Chardita Doṣa** attract **Cāralghu (Āyambil)**, and the final stage, if it is **Aneṣaṇīya**, attracts **Cāraguru (Upavās)**.

**Chardita Doṣa** - Taking alms that are affected by **Chardita Doṣa** attracts **Cāralghu (Āyambil)** penance. The commentator of the **Bṛhatkalpabhāṣya** has further clarified this by stating that taking alms that are affected by the first three stages of the fourth stage of **Chardita Doṣa** attracts **Cāralghu (Āyambil)** penance. The final stage is **Anācīrṇa**.

**Piṇḍaniyukti Samyojana:**  If a monk, influenced by the vices of anger and hatred, engages in internal and external combinations to enhance taste, he incurs the **Cāraguru (fasting)** penance. According to another view, he incurs the **Cāralahu (Āyambil)** penance. According to the *Bṛhatkalpabhāṣya*, internal combination leads to **Cāralahu (Āyambil)** penance, while external combination leads to **Cāraguru (fasting)** penance.

**Proof:** If a monk consumes more food than the prescribed amount for men and women, or more than what is required for a life of restraint, he incurs the **Cāralahu (Āyambil)** penance.

**Angāra Doṣa:** If a monk consumes palatable food with attachment, he incurs the **Cāraguru (fasting)** penance.

**Dhūmadoṣa:** If a monk consumes unpalatable food with hatred, he incurs the **Cāralahu (Āyambil)** penance.

**Kāraṇa Doṣa:** If a monk consumes food without a valid reason, he incurs the **Cāralahu (Āyambil)** penance. According to another view, he incurs the **Laghumās (Pūrimārḍha)** penance. If a monk does not eat when the reason is present, he incurs the **Cāralahu (Āyambil)** penance.

**Explanation:** Literature also mentions the penance of chanting with inhalation and exhalation. According to the *Oghanīyukti Bhāṣya*, if a monk does not properly examine the alms after receiving them, or does not show the full offering to the guru, or if there is a subtle fault in the alms, he should chant the Namaskāra mantra with 8 inhalations and exhalations for purification.

This section mainly discusses the penances for the major faults related to begging. The *Jītakalpasūtra* and its commentary describe the penances for various types of faults in begging.

## Pinḍaniyukti: An Observation

**137 Other Defects of Bhikṣācaryā**

The number of defects of Bhikṣācaryā described in Pinḍaniyukti cannot be considered final. However, looking at the systematic description of Pinḍaniyukti, it can be said that by the time of the Pinḍaniyukti-kāra, the systematic development of Bhikṣācaryā and its related defects had taken place. Although it is mentioned in Bhagavati that a pure-minded ascetic should take food free from the defects of origin, production, and craving, and scattered references to many defects are also found, it is not mentioned there which and how many defects are related to origin, how many to production, and how many to craving. Therefore, it can be said without doubt that the credit for systematically organizing the scattered defects of Bhikṣācaryā in the Āgamas goes to the Pinḍaniyukti-kāra.

In addition to these defects, if we search for general and specific rules in this context, many other defects related to Bhikṣācaryā are found scattered in the Āgamas and their explanatory literature. For example, the inclusion of Nityāgra food is not included in the defects of craving, but it is mentioned in many places. The Daśavaikālika Sūtra also mentions many rules and prohibitions regarding the time spent in wandering for Bhikṣā. Here, we are mentioning the defects related to Bhikṣācaryā found in the Āgamas in addition to Pinḍaniyukti, so that research students can get comprehensive information about the legal and prohibited aspects of Bhikṣācaryā in one place.

**Śayyātarapiṇḍa**

The one who crosses the ocean of existence by giving a bed to the ascetic is called Śayyātar. Śayyātarapiṇḍa is also called Sāgārikapiṇḍa. Śayyātarapiṇḍa is considered unrighteous for the ascetic and prohibited by the Tīrthankaras. Even the 22 Tīrthankaras in between did not allow Śayyātarapiṇḍa. It is counted under the category of Śabala dosa. Seeing the abundance of defects, the Cūrṇikāra considered taking Bhikṣā from the seven houses near the Śayyātar as unrighteous.

The food from the house where the ascetic stayed for one night is called Śayyātarapiṇḍa. If the well-off ascetic stays awake all night and goes elsewhere to perform the necessary tasks like morning Pratikramṇa, then the householder...

##  Pinḍaniryukti

One is not considered a *śayyatara* while staying in a place, but becomes a *śayyatara* upon sleeping and performing necessary (pratikramṇa) actions. If both the night stay and the morning pratikramṇa are performed at another place, then the owners of both places are considered *śayyatara*. The *Nīśītha Bhāṣya* and its *Cūrṇi* provide detailed discussions on when one becomes a *śayyatara*.

Grass, *ḍagala*, alkali, *malla*, bed, bedding, platform, and plaster are not considered *śayyatara-piṇḍa*, hence they can be taken. Even clothes and utensils, including *śaikṣa*, are not *śayyatara-piṇḍa*, meaning they can be taken if the son of a *śayyatara* is initiated. 

Twelve items are considered *śayyatara-piṇḍa*: food, drink, *khādima*, *svādima*, footwear, clothes, utensils, blanket, needle, razor, ear cleaner, and nail cutter.

The main reason for prohibiting *śayyatara-piṇḍa* is that by repeatedly visiting the house where the monk resides, the householder may prepare alms with *ādhākarma* and *auddeśika* faults due to excessive familiarity. Taking daily prescribed food increases attachment to food, and sometimes, frequent visits may also alienate the *śayyatara* from the Dharma or the monks, making it difficult for other monks to find accommodation. The *Bhāṣyakāra* has described in detail the faults arising from accepting *śayyatara-piṇḍa*.

The *Piṇḍaviśuddhiprakaraṇa* mentions two stories in this context. One *śayyatara* gave a blanket to a monk. His son and brother also gave him blankets and other clothes. Due to the burden of abundant equipment, the monk did not travel elsewhere. By divine providence, there was a famine in that area. The householder thought that both the monk and he would perish in the famine, so he should send the monk to a prosperous region by some means. One day, when the monk was going out for *utsarga*, he took out all the equipment, hid it, and set fire to the house. When the monk returned, he gave him some equipment. The monk started to leave for another country, then the *śayyatara* said, "Come back here when there is prosperity." The monk came back there when there was prosperity. The *śayyatara* again offered him his equipment. Thus, accepting *śayyatara-piṇḍa* leads to the diminishment and disrespect of preaching.

Five hundred monks stayed at the house of a householder. The monks used to take their first alms from the *śayyatara* every day. In due course, he became poor. When those monks left, other monks came there. They also requested accommodation. The householder said, "I only have accommodation, but I have nothing to give for the first alms."

## Pindanuyukti: An Observation

**139. "There is nothing."** The Sadhus said, "Shayyatar Bhiksha is not permissible for us." The householder said, "It would be inauspicious for the Sadhus to leave our house with empty bowls, therefore I will not provide lodging." The Sadhus explained and obtained lodging. Thus, obtaining lodging by accepting Shayyatar Pind can be rare.

The Panchashak Prakaran also presents the opinions of other Acharyas regarding the "faults of Shayyatar Pind" and the benefits of not accepting Shayyatar Pind.

**Exceptions:** Shayyatar Pind is permitted for eight reasons: 1. Anagadh or Agadh Glanktav 2. Invitation from Shayyatar 3. Insistence from Shayyatar 4. Rare substance 5. Ashiv 6. Unodari 7. Predvesh 8. Rajdviष्ट.

**Rajpind:** The ninth Uddeshak of Nishita is connected to many prohibitions related to Rajpind. The 22 Tirthankaras in between and the Tirthankaras of Mahavideha also prohibited Sadhus from accepting Rajpind food. Ashan, Pan, Khadim, Swadim, Vastra, Patra, Kambal, and Padapronchan - these eight types of items are called Rajpind if taken from the King's place. Acharya Haribhadra has described the faults of accepting Rajpind food. Detailed discussion on this topic is found in Brihatkalp Bhashya.

The Nishita Sutra mentions Chaturmasik Prayashchitta for the Muni who accepts and consumes Rajpind food. Accepting the delicious and heavy food prepared for the King can increase the desire for taste, therefore Rajpind is prohibited. Like Shayyatar Pind, Rajpind can also be accepted in special exceptions.

**Nityaagrapind:** Nityaagrapind means accepting invited Bhiksha daily from one house. The Dashavaikalik Sutra considers it a fault of Anachar and the Nishita Sutra considers the one who consumes Nityaagrapind as a participant in Prayashchitta. In Nishita, "Nitiy Aggapind" and "Nitiy Pind" words are used instead of Niyag.

## Piṇḍaniyukti

The commentator and the Chūrṇikāra have explained this in detail. According to the Chūrṇikāra, Agastya Singh, accepting alms daily without invitation and with a natural attitude is not a Nityāgra.
Āchārya Bhikṣu has described this in detail in the Āchāra's Chaupai. (Bhikṣu Granth Ratnākar: Āchāra's Chaupai) Āchārya Mahāprajña has discussed this word in detail in the commentary on the Daśavaikālika Sūtra. In the Niśītha Chūrṇi, the disciple has raised a question: If a householder prepares food for himself daily, then if he invites someone respectfully, is there any fault? In response, the commentator says that there is a need to give an invitation, therefore, there may be faults like sthāpanā, ādhākarma, prābhṛtika, adhyavapūraka, krīta and prāmitya, etc. Therefore, one should not accept natural food without an invitation. The one who accepts Nityāgrapiṇḍa receives the Prāyaścitta of Laghumāsa (Pūrimārddha).

## Puraḥkarma and Paścātkarma

Washing hands or vessels, etc., before giving alms is Puraḥkarma. This fault is usually associated with householders. If a Sadhu knows that the giver will clean his hands, etc., with water after giving alms with unclean hands or vessels, then that food is unacceptable for the Sadhu. The one who accepts food from hands, vessels, Dī and Bhājana with Puraḥkarma is a recipient of Prāyaścitta.

If naturally moist hands dry, then alms can be accepted from that giver, but alms cannot be accepted even after the hands dry after Puraḥkarma. In Puraḥkarma, starting the use of water is a serious offense, using water is a moderate offense, and accepting alms with oily hands is a minor offense. Accepting alms with a serious offense results in four Laghumāsa (Āyambila), with a moderate offense results in Laghumāsa (Pūrimārddha), and with a minor offense results in Paṇaga (Nirvigaya) Prāyaścitta. The Br̥hatkalpabhāṣya (1831-63) explains Puraḥkarma in detail.

## Kimicchaka

Food given after asking what someone wants is Kimicchaka. The Daśavaikālika Sūtra considers it under Anāchāra. Some Āchāryas have also considered it as a special characteristic of Rājapinḍa there. The commentary written by Āchārya Mahāprajña in this context is worth reading.

## Pindaniyukti: An Observation

**141**

**Durbhiksha Bhakta**
When a severe famine occurs, the food prepared by a king or a wealthy person for the monks is called Durbhiksha Bhakta. This type of food is unacceptable for a Muni. One who consumes Durbhiksha Bhakta is considered a Viradhak.

**Bardalika Bhakta**
If a king or a householder makes special arrangements for food-donation for the Muni during the rainy season or when dark clouds are present, it is called Bardalika Bhakta. A Muni who consumes Bardalika Bhakta is subject to atonement. According to Nishita Churni, if a king prepares food for the monks for seven consecutive days during the rainy season, it is called Bardalika Bhakta. Like Kantara Bhakta, consuming Bardalika Bhakta is considered Viradhak.

**Kantara Bhakta**
In ancient times, means of transportation were not developed. People generally traveled long distances with a caravan. Monks also traveled on foot with the caravan due to fear of thieves and other dangers. The food prepared for the monks out of compassion in the forest is called Kantara Bhakta. Nishita mentions that one who consumes Aranya Bhakta or Kantara Bhakta is subject to atonement. The commentator Abhaydeva Suri considers Kantara Bhakta, Durbhiksha Bhakta, Glana Bhakta, Balika Bhakta, Praghoornak Bhakta, etc. as part of Adhakarma.

**Praghoornak Bhakta**
Food prepared for a guest is called Praghoornak Bhakta.

**Agra Pind**
Agra Pind Bhikhya, which is prepared in a householder's house, is forbidden for a monk. Nishita mentions that a monk who consumes Agra Pind is subject to atonement. Often, Agra Pind is given to cows, dogs, or beggars in homes. If a monk consumes it, he incurs the fault of Antaray. Consuming Agra Pind makes the monk hasty, and therefore he does not pay attention to Iryasamiti.

##  Chapter 142:  Types of Food Offerings

**Gilanabhakta**

The Bhagavati Sutra considers Gilanabhakta as cautious as the Ahadkarma Ahar.  Tika-kar Abhaydevsuri explains that Gilanabhakta refers to the food given to a sick person for their recovery.  Another meaning of Gilanabhakta is the food given in a hospital.

**Nivedanapinda**

The food offered to deities like Purnabhadra or Manibhadra, either with or without a reason, is called Nivedanapinda.  According to Nisith, a Sadhu who partakes in Nivedanapinda incurs a Prāyaścitta (penance).  Nivedanapinda is of two types: 1. Sadhu Nishrakrit, 2. Anishrakrit.  A Sadhu who consumes Nivedanapinda offered for a Sadhu incurs a Charaguru (fasting) Prāyaścitta, while one who consumes Anishrakrit incurs a Masalghu (half-month) Prāyaścitta.

**Arhat Paksha Deva Pind**

The Pind offered to Jain deities (Arhat Paksha Deva) is also of two types.  Consuming Nishrakrit Pind leads to faults like Agyabhang (disobedience).

**Mritak Bhoj**

This is also called Karaduyabhakta or Pindnikar.  The meal offered on the twelfth day after death is called Mritak Bhoj.  It is forbidden for a Sadhu to accept alms during Mritak Bhoj.

**Nikachit Ahar**

The food offered daily during Chaturmas, due to Bhutikarma (karma related to the body) etc., is called Nikachit Ahar.  According to the Bhashyakar, one who consumes Nikachit Ahar is considered a Deshatah Parswasth (one who is near the place of death).  Consuming Nikachit Ahar incurs a Laghumas (half-month) Prāyaścitta.

**Rachit Ahar**

The Vyavahar Bhashya mentions various faults related to alms in the context of a Muni with Asanklishta Achar (unblemished conduct).  One such fault is Rachit Ahar.  A Muni with Suvihit (good conduct) cannot consume Rachit Ahar.  Acharya Malayagiri, in his commentary on Vyavahar Bhashya, explains Rachit as "keeping food in a vessel."

## Pindaniyukti: An Observation

**143. "To decorate around it with various dishes."** According to Abhaydeva Suri, making modaks again from modak powder is a created fault, which can be placed under the karma bhed of auddeshik dosha.

**Sankaḍi Bhoj**

_Where there is abundant killing of beings, it is called Sankaḍi. Or where various types of food materials are processed, it is called Sanskriti-Sankaḍi. In Majjhima Nikaya, Sankaḍi is called Sankhati. Mahavira prohibited the sadhu from going to Sankaḍi Bhoj because there may be an occasion for debate or conflict with the Tirthika sadhu. In Nisitha Bhashya, it is mentioned that the muni should not go in the direction where Sankaḍi-Bhoj is taking place. A sadhu who takes food in Sankaḍi Bhoj receives the atonement of four anudghāt. There are two types of daily and nightly Sankaḍi - Pur: Sankaḍi and Paschat Sankaḍi. The one done after sunrise is called Pur: Sankaḍi and the one done after sunset is called Paschat Sankaḍi._

_If a sadhu takes Sankaḍi-Bhoj due to attachment, arrogance or without any reason, then it is a fault. If he goes to a Sankaḍi house in the order of household tradition, then there is no fault. If he goes to Sankaḍi for a strong support or purpose, then also there is no fault. The commentator has discussed this in detail in this context._

**Ratri-Bhojan Viramna**

This rule is related to the time of taking Pind and its consumption. In the nineteenth study of Uttaradhyayana, the parents of Mrgaputra, while describing the horror of Sadhutva, have described Ratri-Bhojan Viramna as a very difficult task. Ratri-Bhojan is unaccepted for the sadhu. Jain Acharyas have considered it under the category of Shabal dosha. One rule in the 18 rules of Shraman (Vrat Shatka, Kay Shatka...) is the avoidance of Ratri-Bhojan. To establish the importance of Ratri-Bhojan Viramna, Mahavira did not mention it along with the 46 faults of Bhiksha, but established it as the sixth Vrat along with the five Mahavrata.

## Pindaniyukti

The commentary clearly states that Mahavrata practitioners suffer pain when the sixth night-meal vow is broken.

In Nishītha Chūrṇi, a question is raised: if the atonement for both Ādhākarma and night-meal is four gurus (fasts), which option is less blameworthy? In response, the Chūrṇikāra states that Ādhākarma is detrimental to the secondary qualities, but the night-meal is detrimental to the primary qualities, hence it should be avoided. The Chūrṇikāra has presented many other options in this context.

The Nishītha Sutra presents four options for the night-meal:

* Brought during the day, consumed during the day.
* Brought during the day, consumed during the night.
* Brought during the night, consumed during the day.
* Brought during the night, consumed during the night.

Explaining the first transgression, the Bhāṣyakāra states that if a fasting Muni learns that there is a Sankaḍi feast at the homes of his relatives, he goes there without a bowl. The relatives ask, "Why didn't you bring a bowl?" He replies, "I am fasting today." They then set aside a portion of the Sankaḍi for the Muni, saying, "We will give it to you tomorrow for your parana." The Muni who consumes this on the next day for his parana incurs the first transgression of the night-meal. The Bhāṣyakāra and the Tikākāra have described the other three transgressions and the harms caused by the night-meal in detail.

According to the Bhāṣyakāra, if a Muni accepts alms out of doubt that the sun has not risen, even if the sun rises, he is liable for the atonement of four gurus (fasts). However, if he accepts alms with a confident mind, believing that the sun has not risen, even if it has not risen, he is not liable for the atonement. The Daśavaikalika Sutra mentions the violence-related faults arising from the night-meal. According to the Bṛhatkalpabhāṣya, going out for alms at night creates doubt about the omniscience of the Lord, increases falsehood, and leads to self-contradiction and restraint-contradiction. In the darkness of night, the Muni may stumble and fall, get thorns in his feet, fall into a pit, be bitten by a snake, or be attacked by a dog.

They can cause trouble, a bull can charge, and the guards can harass them thinking they are thieves. The Nīśītha Bhāṣya and its Cūrṇi also describe in detail the faults that arise from eating at night.
Under the category of violation of restraint, violation of the six categories is possible during night travel because in the darkness, it is possible to harm greenery and seeds, etc., as they are not visible. The Bhāṣyakāra has described in detail the violation of restraint that arises from eating at night.
One who eats at night receives the atonement of four Anudghāta months or four Guru months (fasts).
**Gṛhantaraniṣadyā**
At the time of begging, the Muni cannot sit in the house of a householder. The Āgamas consider a Muni who sits in the house of a householder to be a participant in sin and atonement. The Daśavaikalika Sūtra considers sitting in the house of a householder without reason to be immoral.
If the Muni sits in the house of a householder at the time of begging, there is a possibility of breaking celibacy due to excessive contact. Seeing the ascetic sitting in the house waiting for alms, the householder's wife may quickly kill beings in the forbidden time, which hinders other beggars and causes anger in the householder due to hindrance in work.
**Sanniidhi and Sancaya**
It is immoral for an ascetic to accumulate or collect. An ascetic cannot accumulate or collect the alms received. The Sūtras clearly state that an ascetic should not accumulate even a small amount or a speck.1 The one who accumulates food items acts like a householder.2 Mahāvīra did not allow even the accumulation of medicine.13
Although this rule is not directly related to begging, the collection or accumulation of food and water along with utensils also takes place, hence it has been mentioned.

## Cultural Content

Any literature, in some way or another, reflects the cultural, religious, and social conditions of its time, because the writer breathes in society. While being primarily focused on conduct, the literature of Pindianiyukti also depicts the contemporary cultural, social, and familial circumstances as the occasion demands. Although presenting a complete cultural description is not the aim here, some topics are being touched upon. The cultural environment in Pindianiyukti can also be the subject of independent research.

## Deities

India is a land of faith, hence the existence of numerous deities and the practice of their worship is prevalent here. In ancient times, eight-day festivals were also celebrated based on deities, such as Indramaha, Rudramaha, Varunamaha, etc.

When entering a battle, the commander and soldiers would pay homage to Chamundadevi. For the peace of calamities like शीतलक and अशिव, people would worship Manibhadra Yaksha and celebrate together in the Yakshayatan on the eighth and fourteenth days of the lunar fortnight. Manibhadra Deva is also mentioned in the Mahabharata. According to Dr. Jagdishchandra Jain, the oldest statue of Yakshas found is that of Manibhadra Yaksha.

It was a common belief that dogs are special deities of Mount Kailash (Meru) who roam the earth in the form of dogs. They benefit those who worship them and harm those who disrespect them. Deities would reside in the worship of a restrained ascetic. They would also punish an impure disciple. For example, the deity residing in the worship of Sangamacharya caused a torrential downpour with fierce winds to awaken the errant disciple Datta.

Some Acharyas were so powerful that the Vyantara Devas would flee at the sound of their tongs. When Sangamacharya struck his tongs, a child who had been affected by Vyantara for six months stopped crying, and the Vyantara Devi fled from there.

**Renounced Traditions and Sectarianism**

The author mentions several renounced traditions prevalent at the time. In the context of begging, five types of Śramaṇa and five types of Vanīpaka are mentioned. The five types of Śramaṇa are: 1. Nirgrantha, 2. Śākya - Buddhist monks wearing red robes, 3. Tapas, 4. Gairuk - wandering ascetics wearing saffron robes, 5. Ājīvika - ascetics of the Gosālaka tradition.

Those who earned their livelihood through begging were called Vanīpaka. Five types of Vanīpaka are described: Śramaṇa, Brāhmaṇa, Kṛpaṇa, Atithi, and Śvāna. The author describes the characteristics of all these types under the category of Vanīpaka faults. Ascetics of one sect would criticize the ascetics of another sect out of envy. Due to sectarian bias, excellent literary works were burnt. For example, the play *Raṣṭrapāla* written by Āṣāḍhabhūti was burnt because its performance led to the renunciation of 500 Kshatriyas.

**Use of Knowledge and Mantras**

In the society of the time, there was a tradition of mastering specific knowledge and mantras and using them. Mahāvīra prohibited the use of knowledge, mantras, and other means for ascetics, but due to hypocrisy, some ascetics used them to obtain food. Ācārya Pādalipta used mantras to cure the headache of King Muruṇḍa to gain the favor of the Sangha. By using knowledge, ascetics could obtain clothes, ghee, jaggery, etc., in sufficient quantities from even a miserly person. Later, when the knowledge was withdrawn, the person would realize that his clothes, etc., had been stolen. Upon lamenting, his family members would explain that he had donated those items himself.

Some Tapas, through yogic powers, could cross rivers by walking on water. By using special knowledge, Ācārya Samita requested the Krishna River to be crossed. The two banks of the river then merged, and its width became as narrow as the length of his feet. After crossing, the river returned to its original width.

Sometimes, ascetics would change their appearance through supernatural powers and beg from the same house repeatedly. Āṣāḍhabhūti Muni, to obtain sweets from a jester, assumed the form of a deaf, hunchbacked person, and begged three times.

## Chapter 148: Pinḍaniyukti

**The text describes various aspects of life in ancient India, drawing upon the Jain text Pinḍaniyukti and other sources like the Manusmṛti and Kauṭilya's Arthaśāstra.**

**Magic and Occult Practices:**

* The text mentions the use of **Mūlakarma** (root-karma) by ascetics to perform **Garbha-Pariśāṭana** (abortion), **Garbhādhāna** (impregnation), and **Vaśīkaraṇa** (subjugation).
* **Añjana** (collyrium) was used to achieve invisibility.
* The text mentions two minor kings who ate with Chandragupta Maurya while remaining invisible.
* **Pinḍaniyukti** itself describes various occult practices, including the creation of animals like horses through **Sammūrchchima** (a type of magic) without sexual union.

**Astrology and Omens:**

* **Jyotiṣa** (astrology) was highly developed, allowing for the prediction of the color of a foal in the womb.
* **Nimaitta** (omens) were used to interpret dreams and other signs.
* **Śakuna** (omens) were used to determine auspicious and inauspicious events. The sound of a conch shell was considered auspicious and a great omen.

**Economic Life:**

## Pinḍaniryukti: An Observation

**Debt:** A person forcefully took everything from another. Bahin Sammati took two palas of oil from her ascetic brother at double the interest. On the third day, the oil became one karsa. Due to the unlimited debt, she had to accept servitude.

**Medicine:** Indian Ayurvedic science is extremely rich. It mentions three types of treatments: physical, mental, and emotional. The author of the Pinḍaniryukti has described many important facts about Ayurveda and medicine in passing. Through a medical method, a person cured a tiger's blindness.

Milk is considered healthy at the end of a meal. Staying up late at night causes indigestion. To avoid indigestion during illness, clothes should be washed frequently. When bitten by a snake, both mantras and medicine were used. Many facts related to Ayurveda and health are compiled in Appendix 4.

**Grains and Food:** Certain regions were famous for their grains. For example, Gobar Gram in Magadha was famous for its abundant production of Shali. Dr. Kamalchandra Jain has speculated that the village might have been named Gobar due to the easy availability of cow dung. Cow dung manure would have been readily available there, which would have been used as fertilizer.

Kodrava and Rālaka were considered light grains, so poor people often consumed them, while wealthy people used Shali grain. The author of the Pinḍaniryukti has mentioned many grains, pulses, spices, food items, cooking utensils, and cooking methods in passing. For this, see Appendix 16, Special Name Order, page 306.

To protect grains, they were stored in granaries, plastered with cow dung and sealed with lac, etc., so that they would not deteriorate for a long time. The Brihatkalpa Bhashya also provides a scientific method for storing grains.

Pindaniyukti
Vaivaahika Sambandha
Marriages used to take place at a young age. If a daughter or son grew up, their parents were encouraged that your son has become young, why don't you get him married? Lest he elopes with a promiscuous woman without getting married. Similarly, it was said for the daughter that if the marriage is not solemnized in time, the daughter may disgrace your clan. The daughter's marriage should take place before the onset of puberty.

Just as in the present times, in the then society also, the marriage of a daughter was performed by taking a daughter, like the marriage of Devadatta's sister with Dhanadatta and the marriage of Dhanadatta's sister with Devadatta. Although in ancient times, widow remarriage was not accepted, the woman used to observe the vow of chastity throughout her life, but as an exception, the widow of the brother-in-law used to marry the brother-in-law after the death of the brother-in-law.

If there was domestic strife with the first wife, the person used to think of remarrying. Out of the fear of co-wife, the wife would make that maiden different-gendered through the practice of Moolkarma, so that the husband could not remarry. Chandramukha, the wife of the merchant Dhanadatta, made the daughter of the seth different-gendered by feeding her medicines etc. When the fact of being different-gendered came to light, the husband did not marry her. Due to the jealousy of the co-wife, the co-wife used to get the fetus of the second queen aborted during pregnancy, so that her son could not become the crown prince.

In the third month of pregnancy, the pregnant woman experiences the most intense desire, which is called Dohaad. Dohaad and its fulfillment have an important place during the gestational period. If the Dohaad is not fulfilled, it affects both the pregnant woman and the fetus. According to Choornikara Agastyasinh, without the fulfillment of Dohaad, abortion or even death can occur. The Dohaad was fulfilled in one way or the other. King Jitashatru ordered the royal servants to bring golden-backed deer for the fulfillment of the Dohaad of Queen Sudarshana, as the queen had developed a craving to consume the meat of golden-backed deer.

After the birth of the child, the affluent people got the child nurtured and cared for by five types of wet nurses. The one who fed the milk was called Ankadhatri. The one who bathed the child was called Majjanadhātri, the one who adorned and decorated the child was called Mandanadhātri, the one who played with the child was called Kridāpanadhātri, and the one who held the child in her lap was called Ādānadhātri.

Page #165:
---------------------------
Pindaniyukti: A Observation

The one who held the accounts was called the Ankadhatri. The divine legends of the Buddhist tradition mention four types of wet nurses.

Even in a male-dominated society, some men were so subservient to women that they obeyed their every command like slaves. Pindaniyukti mentions six types of inferior men who were dominated by women. The Svetangali, who cleaned the stove and lit it at his wife's behest, the Bakodayaka, who fetched water from the lake every morning, the Kinkara, who worked according to his wife's instructions, the Snayaka, who bathed as per his wife's orders, the Grdhriveidi, who like a vulture, went to his wife with the food vessel, and the Hadjna, who cleaned the child's excreta and urine, were all such men.

Even then, domestic violence existed. Men tortured their wives if work was done against their liking, which the women bore silently. When the Salyodana was changed, both the husbands tortured their wives, who trembled like the branch of a tree. When Marjara ate meat, his wife Rukmini was tortured by her husband Ugrateja out of fear, and when she cooked the vomited meat of a dog, her husband punished her. Somewhere, the wives also got angry at their husbands. When the master took away the milk from the ascetic, the cowherd Vatsaraja, on reaching home with less milk, was scolded by his wife.

There was also conflict between husband and wife over giving alms. The wife wanted to give to Brahmins, while the husband wanted to give to the ascetics.

The author has also mentioned various worldly and Vedic traditions in the context. This does not mean that the author believed in that tradition, but to make the text important and to express his erudition, he has mentioned many worldly beliefs and superstitions prevalent in other religions. Some of these traditions are related to religion and some to society. Expressing the Vedic belief, the author said that the girl child bleeds as many times as her mother goes to hell before her marriage.

Procreation of a son was considered rare. Even in Uttaradhyayana, the priest Bhrigu considered the birth of a son from a worldly point of view.

##  The Importance of Pindaniryukti

This text discusses the importance of Pindaniryukti (a Jain ritual). It explains that if a couple was unable to have children, a ritual called Niyoga was performed. This involved a man called a Lomsha Purusha, who would father a child with the woman. The Manusmriti (a Hindu legal text) also mentions Niyoga, but specifies that only a son should be born through this practice. The text also mentions that a man could pay someone to have their horse breed with another horse.

After a person's death, a statue of them was made and offerings were given. On the anniversary of a parent's death, a feast was held in their memory, either for people with the same name or for everyone.

The text also mentions the tradition of giving charity. People believed that if they didn't give charity, they wouldn't have a good afterlife. Wealthy people would give five types of alms to ascetics and Brahmins, especially after a famine. Women would keep track of the alms they gave by drawing lines on their walls.

The text states that eating beef was considered a great sin. A feast was held for the deceased, which included sweets like Ghevar. This feast was also called Karaduyabhakta. Special foods like laddoos were made for the Udyapan (a Jain ceremony). On special festivals, sevai (a type of noodle) was eaten with ghee and jaggery.

## Transportation

The text also mentions transportation methods. The author describes the ancient transportation routes and methods, including water and land routes. Water routes were traversed by boats, while land routes were covered by carts, donkey carts, bullock carts, and on foot. People who were unable to walk were carried in a Kapotee (a type of palanquin). The text also mentions obstacles faced on water routes, such as deep water.

## Pinḍaniyukti: An Observation

**153.**

* Being caught by crocodiles, tortoises, etc.
* Getting stuck in mud, etc.

_Due to dusty, unpaved roads, there was fear of thorns, snakes, thieves, and wild animals even on land routes. If a monk got separated from the caravan, a bull's horn was blown to find him. The community of monks also traveled from one place to another with the caravan. Sometimes, thieves would be with the caravan, who would forcibly take food from the caravan members and give it to the monks._

**Offenses and Punishments**

The nature of offenses and punishments has changed in every era. The punishment system, which began with the policies of "Hākar," "Mākar," and "Dhikkār," reached the point of capital punishment. In the society of the time of the Pinḍaniyukti, capital punishment was given for violating the king's orders. Those who went to the "Sūryodaya Udyān" (Sunrise Garden) were punished with death for violating the order, while those who went to the "Chandrodaya Udyān" (Moonlight Garden) and saw the inner palace were not punished because they did not violate the king's order.

The one who supports, cooperates, praises, and approves of the sinner is more guilty than the sinner himself. The king would punish those who praised the criminal with capital punishment because it encouraged and supported the crime. The king would also punish those who lived with thieves, etc. The king of Śrīnilaya Nagar, Guṇacandra, gave a humiliating death penalty to the person who had relations with the queens of the inner palace and, through spies, found out who was praising him in the city. The king also severely punished those who praised him.

... Here, a picture of the contemporary cultural situation related to some topics has been presented briefly. More important material on this subject is scattered in this text and its commentary literature, which is a subject of independent research by scholars.

**Process of Text Editing**

The task of text editing in research work is very complex, tedious, and laborious, but important. The meaning of text determination is not just to find one text among the different texts of ancient manuscripts.

## 154
## Pinḍaniryukti

The text variations of other texts should be given considering the main text as the primary source. Textual determination involves careful consideration from multiple perspectives. 
Modern scholars have shed significant light on the subject of textual research. Western scholars divide this work into four parts: 1. Material Collection 2. Text Selection 3. Text Correction 4. Higher Criticism. All four aspects have been considered in the editing of this text. Three bases have been before us for textual correction:
1. Manuscript copies of Pinḍaniryukti.
2. Commentary literature of Pinḍaniryukti (Malayagiriya Tika, Avacuri etc.).
3. Numerous verses of Pinḍaniryukti found in texts like Jitakalphabhashya and Nisithabhashya.

Palm leaf copies of Pinḍaniryukti are rare, hence only copies written on paper in the 15th and 16th centuries have been used in text editing. In textual correction and selection, we have given prominence to the text of the copies, but no single copy has been made the basis of text selection, nor has the decision been made based on majority. The text that seemed appropriate based on the justification of semantic interpretation, the explanation of the commentary, and the context, has been included in the original text. In some places, the text of the commentary seemed appropriate based on the explanation, so it has also been included in the original, and the text of the copies has been given in the text variations.

In verse determination, we have taken utmost care that any verse that seemed incompatible with the language style of the Pinḍaniryukti or irrelevant to the subject matter has not been included with the original number. Discussion and commentary have been presented regarding many verses, explaining why they are not part of the Pinḍaniryukti but were later interpolated or added to the commentary's Pinḍaniryukti. Some points regarding text editing are presented here:
• In some places, a word, line, or verse is missing in a copy, which has been indicated by the symbol 'x' in the footnote. Where the text variation is on more than one word or in a line, it has been indicated by the symbol ' ' .
• Textual variations of elements like 'ch', 'u', 'v' etc. have been determined mainly based on the explanation of the commentary.
• Where the original consonant-based text has been found, it has been accepted in the original from the perspective of antiquity, but in the absence of the text, the text with the 'y' sound has also been accepted. Therefore, in the same text, 'soy' text will be found in some places and 'sot' in others. The text with the 't' sound has not been given priority, for example - 'kato' (kago).

## Pinḍaniryukti: An Observation

**Based on the manuscripts, the term 'dāram' is mentioned after the verses, but in many places, they cannot be considered as dvāragāthās from the perspective of the subject matter.**

**Where there have been textual variations due to the scribe's error, those variations have not been mentioned in most cases, but where there was a possibility of another meaning from that word, those variations have been mentioned.**

**Western scholars Lumen (for Daśavaikālika) and Elfsdorf (for Uttarādhyayana) have done textual emendation and textual discussion in many places from the perspective of meter. They have used meter technique as a tool. Jacobi has determined the antiquity and modernity of the verses based on the meter. According to him, the literature composed in Āryā meter is later and the verses used in Vedic meters are ancient. In Pinḍaniryukti also, full attention has been paid to the meter perspective in text editing. In many places, textual errors have been caught based on the meter. In text editing, we have not given separate instructions for the sub-types of Āryā, but if the verses are composed in a meter other than Āryā, then it has been mentioned in the commentary.**

**In Pinḍaniryukti, in some places, both Anuṣṭup and Āryā meters have been used in the same verse, for example, three stanzas of Āryā and one of Anuṣṭup, or three Anuṣṭup and one Āryā. Wherever there is a mixture of meters, it has also been mentioned in the footnotes.**

**In many places, from the perspective of meter, there has been use of case endings without case endings, non-characteristic makāra, and singular in place of plural or plural in place of singular, where the commentator has presented an instruction or discussion, it has been mentioned in the footnote, for example:**

**"Here, due to the metrical significance of the two ikāras, the initial word is reversed, and due to the non-characteristic nature of makāra, this instruction is to be seen."**

**"In the sūtra, the absence of case endings is due to being Ārṣa."**

**"Here, everywhere, the seventh case is used in the sense of the third case due to the characteristics of Prakrit."**

**"In 'Sehamāiṇa', makāra is non-characteristic."**

**"The word 'nema' is a local word, established in the sense of action."**

**"The verb 'sīdati' has multiple meanings, therefore it means 'phalati'."**

**"The feminine gender indication is in the Prakrit style."**

**For the convenience of researchers, the serial numbers of the edited Pinḍaniryukti have been given at the beginning and the serial numbers of the commentary at the end of the verse. This will make it easier to see the commentary of any verse. Although we were supposed to give the commentary verses published in the commentary along with it, there was not much importance in giving the commentary verses published in the commentary separately, but the commentary was not edited and the verses had already been set, so the commentary verses have been given at the end of the Pinḍaniryukti verses.**

##  Piṇḍa Nirukta

In some cases, the page number of the commentary given behind the Bhagavati Bhāṣya has been given as a reference to the Bhagavati Ṭīkā.
•
• The word-list does not include Sanskrit-based words that are used in Prakrit without any change, such as: Kovida, Khara, Gala, Turanga, Nicaya, Samvāya, Madhu, etc.

The task of editing the text from manuscripts is extremely difficult. A competent Acharya like Abhaydeva Suri, the author of the Navāngī Ṭīkā, has described the various differences and difficulties encountered in this context. Yet, he performed the great task of worshipping the Śruta. Inspired by the venerable ones, taking him as an ideal, this work was started and a little bit of worship of the Śruta was done.

**History of the Editing of Piṇḍaniyukti**

After the completion of the text editing of the Niyukti Pañcaka and the Āvashyaka Niyukti, it was necessary to edit the second part of the Āvashyaka Niyukti. However, in the intervening four years, I was busy traveling outside Lāḍanū and writing the history of the Samanasreṇī, so the work of editing the Āgama was almost abandoned. When the revered ones appointed me to this task again, I could not focus on it for many days. I took up the task of editing the Āvashyaka Niyukti many times, but due to its complexity, it was abandoned each time. Therefore, I started the work of Piṇḍaniyukti before the Āvashyaka Niyukti. Although the work of editing this text from manuscripts was completed in **1988**, when it was published, the text was compared with manuscripts obtained from Pāṭaṇa and Ahmedabad, which involved a lot of effort. After the Gaṅgāśahar Maryādā-Mahotsava, I started this work with the firm resolve to complete it by the next Āsīnda Maryādā-Mahotsava. From Diwali to the Maryādā-Mahotsava, I worked till midnight, even in the biting cold, but due to the extensive introduction, the work could not be completed within the stipulated time. Today, I am experiencing immense satisfaction at its completion. In this context, I firmly believe that such important tasks are possible only with the grace of the Guru, the blessings of the elders, and the strength of the Sangha. The individual is merely an instrument.

Although there were many obstacles and complexities in this work, they were overcome by the grace of the Guru. All the Āgama texts published till date have received the full cooperation and guidance of the Āgama scholar Muni Śrī Dulharājī. Although I did not have his direct presence this time, he had prepared the ground, which made this work easier. The translation of Piṇḍaniyukti was completed by his swift pen. I cannot diminish my debt to him by expressing my gratitude, because he not only provided guidance, but also taught me how to translate and how to focus on the task with unwavering commitment. Most of the annotations and the detailed introduction written on this text are the result of his efforts.

**Acknowledgement**

I am eternally grateful to Ganadhipati Gurudev Shri Tulsi for inspiring me to value time. Revered Acharya Pravara and Yuvacharya have not only appointed me to this Agam work, freeing me from travel and other duties, but also empowered me with strength, keeping me constantly energized. I can only offer these humble verses at their feet:

*Yadatra Sausthavam Kinchit, Tad Gurvoreva Me Na Hi.*
*Yadatra Asausthavam Kinchit, Tanmamaeva Tayo Na Hi.*

The affectionate gaze of Mahashramanee Sadhvi Pramukha Kanak Prabhaji keeps me free from despair and constantly active. The meticulous organization of the esteemed Chief Organizer Vishruta Vibhaji and Organizer Samani Madhura Prajnaji has made this work easy to complete. Despite her physical weakness, Sadhvi Siddha Prajnaji's spirit is incredibly strong. She has generously helped me whenever I faced difficulties in separating the appointment and commentary. The support of the Jain Vishva Bharati officials and administrators has also been invaluable. Kusum Surana's hard work is evident in the composing and setting. Finally, I express my gratitude to the Samani Vrinda and offer my heartfelt devotion at the feet of Shrutadevata, with the firm resolve to soon dedicate the next chapter of the appointment to the Sangha and Sanghapati.

**1.**  As per the method of **samyojana** (joining) of **pindas** (bodies), there are six types of **nikshep** (deposition) due to **ingal-dhum** (fire-smoke) as the cause, in the **atthavihar** (eight types of conduct).

**2.**  In the **pind-nikaya-samuhe** (group of bodies), **sampindana** (joining together) and **pindana** (body-making) are the same. **Samusarana** (movement), **nichaya** (determination), **uvacaya** (increase), **chaya** (shadow), **jumma** (burden), and **rasi** (heap) are also the same.

**3.**  The **nikshev** (deposition) of the **pinda** (body) is of four or six types. The **kayavva** (form) of the **nikshev** is called **nikkhev** (deposition).

**4.**  In the **kula** (family), there are four types of **samhava** (birth) and six types of **chakkag** (six-fold). There is a rule for **samhava** (birth), so the **chakkag** (six-fold) is **nikkhev** (deposited).

**5.**  The **namathavana-pinda** (name-giving body) is **nikshev** (deposited) in **davva** (wealth), **khetta** (field), **kala** (time), and **bhava** (state). This is the **nikshev** (deposition) of the **pinda** (body) in six ways.

**6.**  If it is done by **gonnam** (common) or **samayakatam** (proper time) or both, then it is called **namathavana-pinda** (name-giving body).

##  **The Composition of the Body**

There are three kinds of body-matter: **saccitta** (conscious), **misao** (mixed), and **acitta** (unconscious). Each of these has nine subdivisions. 

**Earth, water, fire, and air** are the four elements. They are classified as **single-sensed**, **two-sensed**, **three-sensed**, and **four-sensed** or **five-sensed**.

Earth-matter is of three kinds: **saccitta**, **misao**, and **acitta**. **Saccitta** is further divided into **nichchya** (definite) and **vavahari** (conventional).

**Nichchya saccitta** is the earth-matter that forms the great mountains and other large masses. **Acitta misao** is the rest, and **vavahari saccitta** is the conventional earth-matter.

**Milk, curd, butter, and ghee** are **misao** (mixed) substances. They are produced from **kiththolle** (wood) and **indhane** (fuel). They are also classified as **single-fuel**, **two-fuel**, **three-fuel**, and **multi-fuel**.

**Salt, sourness, bitterness, and astringency** are **acitta** (unconscious) substances. They are produced from **fire**, **loonus** (salt), and **ambile** (sourness).

**Avaraddhiga** (obstruction), **vis** (poison), and **bandhe** (binding) are also **acitta** substances. They are produced from **salt** and **surabhiuvalae** (fragrant substances).

**Location, position, and destruction** are **acitta** substances. They are produced from **uccara** (pronunciation) and other **ussago** (efforts).

**Ghattag** (hardness), **daglagalevo** (smoothness), and other qualities are also **acitta** substances. They are produced from **payoayana** (nourishment).

**Water-matter** is of three kinds: **saccitta**, **misao**, and **acitta**. **Saccitta** is further divided into **nichchya** (definite) and **vavahari** (conventional).

**16.** The vast oceans, like the earth, are the foundation of the universe, hard and vast, not repeating themselves, nor are they the oceans of anything. **17.** With a firm and certain mind, one should be free from the rules of conduct. **18.** When water is used for drinking, or for punishment, or for measuring, or for washing rice, it is considered pure. **17/1.** The water used for washing vessels, for bathing, for blowing bubbles, or for cooking rice, is considered pure. **17/2.** These are the rules, and there is no possibility of any other time-based rule. The water used for washing vessels, for bathing, for blowing bubbles, or for cooking rice, is considered pure. **17/3.** "Until it is very pure," "until the rice is cooked," "this is it," these are the rules. The measure is not certain, but it is not necessary for it to be very pure. **18.** Water used for cooling, for heating, for salting, for eating, for fire, for salt, for pickles, is considered pure. **22.** Water used for washing, for drinking, for hands, for washing clothes, for washing utensils, for washing food, is considered pure. **23.** Water used for bathing, for washing, for cleaning, for removing dirt, for purifying, for destroying evil, is considered pure. **21.** Water used for washing, for cooling, for applying medicine, for washing clothes, for washing the body, for washing the house, is considered pure.

These gāthās should not be considered as Niyukti but as Bhāṣya, because even in other Ācārāṅga etc. Niyuktis, there is no mention of differences of opinion specifically. By the time of the Bhāṣyakāra, differences of opinion had begun, so these gāthās should be from the Bhāṣya. Also, the previous gāthā "Dhovatthaṁ Tinni"....... (Pibhā 11) is from the Bhāṣya. Even if these gāthās are not considered as Niyukti, there is no difference from the point of view of the current subject matter.

**44/4.**  He who is not well-disposed, is unrestrained, does not desist from food, and desires what is wrong, 
is filled with anger, has the poison of passion, and is a body of evil deeds. ||63||

**45.** He who is destroyed by karma, becomes completely ill-disposed. 
He who is liberated by it, becomes well-disposed, and is known as a non-deceiver. ||64||

**46.** He who is a true Jain, by virtue of his right faith, knowledge, and conduct, 
becomes a **Pind** (body) worthy of being worshipped. ||65||

**47.** He who, by his nature, is able to control his **Pind** (body) which is sticky and difficult to control, 
becomes a **Bhavpind** (body of nature), for he is the **Pind** (body) of the **Pind** (body). ||66||

**47.** He who is not attached to wealth, and whose nature is well-disposed, 
is like a person who has uttered the right words, and is worthy of being praised. ||67||

**48.** He who practices **Pind** (body) purification by means of food, medicine, and rest, 
is pure in all eight aspects of his **Pind** (body). ||68||

**49.** Liberation is the goal, and right knowledge is the cause of it. 
Food is the cause of right knowledge. ||69||

**49/1.** Just as the thread is the cause of the cloth, 
so is food the cause of liberation. ||70||

**Notes:**

1. The verses 44/1-4 are explained in the commentary in the order of the **Niga** (a system of Jain scriptures).
2. The commentator has not mentioned any **Niga** for these verses, but they should be part of the commentary. The 44th verse is expanded in these verses.
3. Even without the **Niga** order, the 44th verse seems to be connected to the 45th verse in terms of content.
4. The verses 49/1-2 are explained in the commentary in the order of the **Niga**.
5. The commentary is brief and does not provide detailed explanations. It is possible that these verses are part of the commentary.

These are the names that are combined together for "Esana." || 73 ||

wherever "Esana" is connected, there "Joejja" should be understood. || 76 || 

52/3. "Bhavesana" is of three types, "Gavesa-Gahana-Esana" should be understood. 
"Ghase-Esana" is the first, and it is understood by those who have attained "Vit-Raga." || 77 || 

52/4. "Agavittassa" does not have "Gahana," and "Ag-Ahiyas" does not have "Paribhoga." 
This is the meaning of "Esana-Tiga," and it should not be understood in a sequential manner. || 78 || 

53. The name "Thavana" should be understood in terms of "Daviya" and "Bhavammi" in relation to "Gavesana." 
In "Daviya," "Kuranga-Gaya," "Uggam-Uppa-Dana" should be understood in terms of "Bhavammi." || 79 ||

It is called the path of non-violence, and it leads to liberation. || 85 || 57. Just as there are different types of food,

For verses 54 and 55, the commentary has the indication of 'niyuktikaro gatham pathati'. It is possible that these two verses became famous as Nigas by the time of the commentator. Respecting the mention of the commentator, these two verses have been kept in the number of Nigas.

The commentator does not explain the verses of the deposit-related verses in such detail, so it seems that the commentator must have explained them in detail. Even during the time of the commentator Malayagiri, these verses were known as niyukti verses. In verse 73/9, Malayagiri has mentioned 'svayameva shrotaro 'bhotsyante iti buddhya niyuktikrunnodahritavan' and in verse 73/14, he has mentioned 'lingachhadejja (jibha 1142), this verse is only found in the K darshan.

Because of being explanatory, they are not included in the number of the niyukti. The explanation of the 'kassa' door in the original door verse is in verse 73 and the explanation of the 'kim' door is in verse 75, therefore, from the point of view of the subject, there is no obstacle in not considering them as a part of the niyukti.

• The fourth line of Verse 82 and the first line of 82/3 are almost the same in terms of words, 5. 'Yammi (Mu).
This verse should be part of the commentary. The compilers do not repeat so much. 6. Tu. Jibha 1157, Ba, K, La, and Sa. This is not a verse. It should be part of the commentary. The compilers do not repeat so much. 7. Tu. Jibha 1174.
Verse 82 directly connects to Verse 83 in terms of subject matter. The author has left something unsaid in the fourth line of 82. Therefore, 8. Aahakamme Nimantei (Jibha 1177), Aahayakayam Nimantei (Sa, K), Tu. Nibha 2662, Tu. Bribha 5341.
Verse 83 mentions the faults of accepting the invitation to eat. 9. "Chalanaanam (La, Ba), see Pari. 3, Katha Sa. 10 for the expansion of the story.

**116.**  "Just as fuel, smoke, and smell are not the body, etc., so also food smell is not the body."

**116/1.** "Fuel is the primary element, smoke is the secondary, and all people breathe it, so it is said to be all."

**116/2.** "But..."

**116/3.** "O seeker! Fuel, etc., are all subtle impurities, and this is the way they are perceived. There is no removal of them."

**116/4.** "A thing that is not perceived is not perceived, and what is perceived is not perceived. It is not perceived, and it is not perceived."

**117.** "Washing does not make the body free from impurities, because it is a karmic action. Just as there are no qualities in water, so also there is no purity."

**117/1.** "Washing does not make the body free from impurities, because it is a karmic action. Just as there are no qualities in water, so also there is no purity."

**117/2.** "In the world, even bad smells, when transformed, do not pollute. Just as the dead do not pollute, so also those who have gone far away do not pollute."

**117/3.** "The rest of the substances, by means of them, are perceived as subtle impurities. They are perceived as subtle impurities, and they are perceived as subtle impurities."

**Notes:**

* **Pindaniyukti:** This refers to the Jain concept of the body and its impurities.
* **Fuel, smoke, and smell:** These are used as metaphors to illustrate that the body is not the same as its temporary attributes.
* **Food smell:** This is another example of a temporary attribute that is not the body itself.
* **Subtle impurities:** These are the karmic residues that cling to the soul and cause suffering.
* **Washing:** This is used as an example of a karmic action that does not remove the root cause of suffering.
* **Dead:** This is used as an example of something that no longer has the capacity to pollute.
* **Gone far away:** This is used as an example of something that is no longer in close proximity and therefore cannot pollute.
* **Subtle impurities:** These are the karmic residues that cling to the soul and cause suffering.

136/1. He eats the alms-food, but does not perform the Pratikramana of that place. 
Just as the owl flies about in the darkness, so also he moves about stealthily.

136/2. His body is emaciated, his skin is wrinkled, his eyes are sunken, and his limbs are unsteady.
He has a distorted vision, and his mind is disturbed.

136/3. Thinking that 'he is not purified in the outer door of the house', he stays outside the house, like one who is rejected.

136/4. Indolent in his conduct, he asks questions of those who have come to another place.
He talks about this world and the next world, wishing to deceive this world.

136/5. The alms-seeker does not accept alms at the outer door of the house, thinking 'I am an ascetic living on alms'.
When you ask me, 'How do you live?', I say 'I live on the alms-bowl'.

136/6. The explanation of the virtues of the ascetic pleases him in the same way.
These are the crows that wander about, but we are the Chiravayara, the true ascetics.

137. The Prayogakarana is of two kinds - the Pragadakarana and the Prakasakarana.
The Pragada is the purification of the place by sweeping, and the Prakasa is the illumination.

**138.** The light of the lamp, does not burn the well-prepared food.
_The uncooked food_, burns, burning without being cooked. || 299 || 138/1. The mobile stove, and the external stove, were made in the past.
Then, they burn sometimes, _the fuel and the fire_. || 300 || 138/2. You do not want it in the darkness, the external stove is good for the accomplished.
Thus, _remove the darkness_, then _in the light_, it is the same. || 301 || 138/3. The fish-smell inside, the external wind is near the burning.
Thus, _the taking of the uncooked food_, is a difference in the making of the food. || 302 || 138/4. The cook cuts the vegetables, the carpenter makes the door, or makes the food.
He removes the covering, or _places the lamp_, burning. || 303 || 138/5. The light of the lamp, is the same as saying, _the uncooked food_, or _the cooked food_.

**140.** The word 'pi' is of two types, in substance and in feeling, like powdered substance etc. in substance. In feeling, it is the influence of others, or it is one's own nature. || 307 ||

**141.** Fragrant balls, colored clothes, these are the substances that are considered 'pi'.  The act of going, the act of flying, the act of making a sound, the act of taking, these are the feelings. || 308 ||

**142.** Wind, etc., and the mind, etc., are influenced by others, and are restrained by the restraint of the self.  The act of producing, the act of inviting, the act of keeping in a cage, the act of hitting, these are the feelings. || 309 ||

**142/1.** The mind, like the ocean, is full of desires, and it asks many questions. Where will you go?  Who will make you happy? || 310 ||

**142/2.** The restraint is given, the invitation is taken, the act of doing is done.  In the past and the future, it is agitated in the same house. || 311 ||

**143.** The 'Dhammakah' is the story, the 'Nimitta Atava' is the place of the story.  The caste, the family, the group, the karma, the profession, these are the feelings in the story. || 312 ||

143/3.  This is the explanation of the term 'vadi' (meaning 'one who argues') in the context of 'nimitta ayavayamma' (meaning 'the cause of the body').
The term 'vadi' is used for those who are learned in the scriptures, like the Ganis (Jain monks) and others, and those who are skilled in the scriptures, like the Ayariyas (Jain monks) and others. || 315 ||

144.  There are two types of 'pamiccha' (meaning 'offering'), namely 'loiya' (meaning 'worldly') and 'loguttara' (meaning 'transcendental').
'Loiya' includes offerings like 'sajjhili' (meaning 'food') and others, while 'loguttara' includes offerings like 'vattha' (meaning 'clothes') and others. || 316 ||

144/1.  The method of approaching a 'sut' (meaning 'Jain monk') is to ask him questions, and to say 'jiva ti sasa te' (meaning 'you are a living being').
One should enter the 'paga' (meaning 'house') and prevent him from leaving, and offer him 'tell' (meaning 'oil') and 'jati' (meaning 'perfume'). || 317 ||

144/2.  One should not offer 'apariimitatill' (meaning 'infinite wealth') or 'dasatta' (meaning 'slavery') to a 'sut'.
If one offers 'dasatta', one should not be ashamed to say 'achira moemi appahe' (meaning 'I will soon become poor'). || 318 ||

144/3.  When a 'bhikkhudag' (meaning 'Jain monk') is about to start his 'samarambha' (meaning 'work'), one should say 'kahimbhe' (meaning 'tell me') and ask him to stay.
One should offer him 'sammvaaya' (meaning 'food') and say 'kaivaya u' (meaning 'how much do you want'). || 319 ||

144/4.  These are the faults, especially in the context of 'vatthapaasa' (meaning 'clothes and food').
These faults are present in 'loiyapamiccha' (meaning 'worldly offerings') and 'loguttariya' (meaning 'transcendental offerings'). || 320 ||

145.  One should not offer 'mailiyar' (meaning 'dirty'), 'faliyar' (meaning 'rotten'), or 'khosit' (meaning 'worn out') things to a 'sut'.
One should not offer him food that is not good for his health, or that is not beautiful, or that is difficult to digest, or that causes quarrels. || 321 ||

**147.**  There are two types of Pariyatta, the lower and the higher, in summary. Each one is also of two types, in terms of its substance, food substance.

**148.**  The lower and the higher are connected, joined by two types of food. The Puggalia is connected, the Pariyatta is a collection of knowledge.

**148/1.**  Compassion for a sister's household, a poor Pariyatta, even for a cruel person.  A question for a cruel person, a mosquito does not fly in a storm.

**149.**  A diminished, weak one, or a heavy, broken, rotten, iron-like one.  A bad food, or a transformed food, or a food that is eaten.

**173/3.**  By the act of killing, he takes on the karma of the cow, and suffers the consequences.  He does not attain liberation. 
**173/4.**  A Jain does not kill a cow, nor does he eat its milk.  He follows the path of non-violence.  Why then does a householder commit such a sin?  He is not compassionate.  He is not a true Jain.  He does not understand the true nature of food.  He is attached to the world.  He is not free from the cycle of birth and death.

**174.**

**175.**  A cow is like a mother.  A calf is like a child.  A householder who kills a cow, kills a mother.  He kills a child.  He commits a great sin.  He is not a true Jain.

210/1. Giving to the worthy, to the earth-deities, is a gift of great fruit.
What to speak of the Brahma-bandhus, what to speak of those who are devoted to the sixfold conduct? || 448 ||

210/2. What to speak of the weak, the wretched, the unattached, the fearful, the trembling?
In the world of the worthy, the tooth of the giver takes away the gift. || 449 ||

210/3. The world gives with its hand, to the familiar, to the worthy.
But he who gives with a half-hearted mind, his gift is truly not worthy. || 450 ||

210/4. What to speak of the easily available, the food of the cows and the like, the grass and the like?
The easily available food of the hungry, the thirsty, is not easily available. || 451 ||

210/5. These are the beings of Kailasa, who have come to this earth in disguise.
They wander about in the form of yakshas, worthy and unworthy, beneficial and harmful. || 452 ||

211. This is the meaning, seen in the world, in the matter of giving and receiving.
These are the faults of the worthy, the virtuous, the wise, as mentioned one by one. || 453 ||

212. Just as crows and the like, are known by their grasping nature.
So also, he who is seen to be greedy in the world, is known to be a beggar, whether he asks or not. || 454 ||

213. A gift is not fruitless, it is seen to be beneficial in the case of those who have received it.
These faults, as mentioned, are seen in the case of those who have received it, what to speak of those who have not received it? || 455 ||

214. He says, "I am not a physician, nor do I speak of my own actions." 
Or even by knowledge, the threefold treatment should be understood. [456] End.

214/1. The sick person, who has gone for alms, asks, "Am I a physician?"

Atthavatthiya. The done, the not-understood, "This is the understanding." [457]

214/2. Such a pain, may it be cured by the medicine without delay.
As soon as it arises, we avoid it with the eighth and others. [458]

214/3. Purification, pacification, and avoidance of the cause, wherever
There is disturbance of the elements, it performs the action. [459]

215. For the uncontrolled and the unfit, the binding, the killing of the body, the iron ball.
The carrying away of the weak, the excessive rise, the seizure and the fall. [460]

216. 'Handcraft-mountain-flower' Rajagaha and likewise Campa.
Kaddha, filled with ghee, the desired, obtained likewise the lion's mane. [461]

217. The power of knowledge and austerity, the beloved in the royal family.
The innate strength, 'He gives the mass of anger.' [462]

218. Arising from others, if he is deprived, he gets angry.
In the fruit of anger, 'if it is firm', what is obtained, the mass of anger. [463]

Insulted by others, he is one who is attached to the body. || 465 || 219/1. In the midst of the assembly, what joy can one who is attached to the body find?
He is called a "body-attached" one, a small one, he says, "I am attached." || 466 || 219/2. Even if he is aware, he does not give up his attachment to the body.
He desires to be praised, he says, "I am attached." || 467 || 219/3. The enlightened one, the perfected one, says to the householder, "If you get it, give it to me, do not make me suffer." || 468 || 219/4. Asking whose house, the assembly asks, "Which one is that?"
What will it do to us, he says, "It does not burn you." || 469 || 219/5. "It burns," he said, if you are not a man of six months.

**221.** There are two types of *santhava*: *sambandhi-vayanasanthava* and *vayanasanthava*.
Each of these is of two types: *pulli* and *pacchha*.

**222.** *Matapiti* is the *puvvasanthava*, and *sasuu-sasuraigaan* is the *pacchha*.
The relationship of *gihisanthava* is established by *putvi* and *pacchha*.

**222/1.** *Ayavayam* and *paravayam* are related to the name, according to its meaning.
My *mata* is *erisia*, and *sasa*, *dhuta*, and *natta* are also *erisia*.

**222/2.** *Adhiti* is the *ditthipahnhay*, and asking "who is my mother?" is *merisi*.
The relationship is like that of a *thanakha*, and *sunha* is the *padaan*.

**223.** The fault of *pacchasanthava* is that it is *sasuu-vihavaadi* and *dhuyadhaan*.
*Bhajja* is also *merisi*, and *sajjo*, *ghaato*, and *bhangao* are also *merisi*.

**224.** *Mayavi* and *chadukaari* are those who deceive us.
*Nicchubhanaadi* is the *panta*, and *karejja* is the *bhadde* in which there is a *padibandho*.

**225.** *Pulli* is established by *gunasanthava*, and *thunjjahi* is established by *santasanthava*.
*Dayaram* is *dinnamm* in this, and that is *pulli santhava*.

This is a beloved medicine, Akhatare 'Jajjiv Adhikarana'. || 506 || 231/7.  Saddhi, adorned with anklets, Adhiti asked, "Is he my wealth?"
'Joga Jonugghandan', Padisheh, a neighbor's boast. || 507 || 231/8.  May your clan not be entangled, we are daughters born of an unblemished lineage.
Dharma is 'Lohiyasya Ya', 'Jai Bindu... Tatthya Naraga'. || 508 || 231/9.  Why is a son not considered, a son who is the lineage of the clan's 'Gottakitti'?
Later, even that task, Asangha, may not destroy us. || 509 || 231/10.  Why Adhiti? She asked, "My Goddess, I am a wealthy pregnant woman."
The womb's protection is yours, I will do it, do not ask Adhiti. || 510 || 231/11.  If a son is born to me, 'even then' he is considered inferior by other young men.
He gives a scolding, and the neighbor's slander is not there. || 511 || 232.  In the unification of the body, 'Kamapavitti' is done in the same way.
The same boast, 'Jajjiya Bhogantaraayam Cha'. || 512 || 233.  Thus, for the one who is established, the one who has arisen, the one who has been purified.
The one who has been purified by taking and giving up, the Pindas' taking happens. || 513 || 234.  The faults of arising, 'Saahu Samautthite Viyaanahi'.
'The faults of taking, are said to be from within and outside'. || 514 ||

Even a Kevali (omniscient) would be considered impure, if he takes something impure. || 524 || 240. In the absence of purity, there is no liberation, and therefore liberation is useless.
And in the absence of liberation, the purification of the senses is useless. || 525 || 240/1. But what about the alms that are given, and not asked for?
One who is doubtful, eats it with doubt. || 526 || 240/2. With a doubtful mind, one eats food that is contaminated.
One who is free from doubt, eats food that is pure. || 527 || 240/3. "I have received alms in this house."
Even if the food is pure, it becomes impure due to doubt. || 528 || 240/4. If doubt is a cause of impurity, then even pure food becomes impure.
That which is free from doubt, even if it is not pure, is free from blame. || 529 ||

290. Just as the combinations (of elements), so also is the manifestation (of qualities). The difference is in the cause.
That which is to be given and that which is not to be given, such as food, water, etc., both these substances are given (to the ascetic) by the householder.

291/1. That which is pure is pure, the four types of impurities are in the act of giving. Even in small or large quantities, the four (types of impurities) are the same, so also the accepted and the unaccepted. 608 There are two kinds, in substance and in state, and one is of both kinds. In the state, there is the attainment of equanimity.

Even an unripe substance has six (qualities), in the living being there are six (qualities) without exception, from the visible, the curd and the milk, the unripe, the ripe, the unripe in the ripe.

294. In the general, if it undergoes transformation, then I give it there, not the rest, the unripe in the state.
295. Even by one, this is attained in the mind, that too is not to be desired, the attainment of equanimity is the aim.

295/1. That which is to be taken is the pure, in the pure, there should not be attachment to taste and touch, thus it is said.

**295/4.**  "Aayambilaparange", for six months continuously, one should fast.
If one does not fast for six months, then one should fast for one day. || 616 ||

**295/5.**  Thus, one should fast for one day, "Aayambilaparana".
Day by day, one should count, "Aayambila" should not be left out. || 617 ||

**295/6.**  If one does not follow this, then "esse" (this) becomes a sin.
One should always perform "Aayambila" by overcoming the sin. || 618 ||

**295/7.**  Marhatthag, Kosalaga, Soviraga, Kurubhoino, these are the types of men.
If even they fast, then what is the name of the one who does not fast? || 619 ||

**295/8.**  For the ascetics, cold is three, for the householders, hot is three, and for the animals, it is three.
The taking of food, etc., should be done in the extreme conditions. || 620 ||

**295/9.**  Food, time, and bed, these three are hot for the householders and cold for the ascetics.
Therefore, they are destroyed by these two, hot and cold food. || 621 ||

**295/10.**  These three, for the ascetics, are cold even in summer.
Therefore, they are destroyed by fire, and then there are two faults, indigestion, etc. || 622 ||

**Notes:**

1.  "Aayambilaparana" refers to a specific type of fast in Jainism.
2.  "Esse" is a Jain term for sin.
3.  "Marhatthag", "Kosalaga", "Soviraga", and "Kurubhoino" are types of men based on their character and behavior.
4.  The three "cold" conditions for ascetics are: cold weather, cold food, and cold water.
5.  The three "hot" conditions for householders are: hot weather, hot food, and hot water.
6.  The three "hot" conditions for animals are: hot weather, hot food, and hot water.
7.  "Indigestion" is a common problem for those who do not follow the proper dietary guidelines in Jainism.

**306.**  The **sanjoyanās** are faults, which bind the food and drink.
They cause harm to the **rasahetu** (taste-producing factor) and the body. || 638 ||

**307.**  The **sanjoyanās** are in the sense of "binding" those substances.
"**Sanjoyayate karma**" (karma is bound), through karma, there is birth and then suffering. || 639 ||

**308.**  The **patteya** (food) and **puralambha** (drink) are consumed, and the remaining portion is discarded.
This is the **sanjoga** (association) that is seen, and karma is produced by it. || 640 ||

**309.**  When the **rasahetu** is destroyed, the **sanjoga** is considered to be harmful.
For one who has no desire for food, and whose taste is not awakened. || 641 ||

**310.**  Thirty-two **kavalas** (mouthfuls) are said to be the "**kucchipūrṇa**" (full stomach) for a man.
For a woman, it is twenty-eight **kavalas**. || 642 ||

**311.**  Less than this, half or even less than half, is the food for a **sāhu** (noble) person.
For a **dhīra** (wise) person, it is the same as for a woman and a **yoma** (young man). || 643 ||

**312.**  **Pakāma** (cooked) and **nikāma** (uncooked), **paṇīta** (refined) food and drink.
Too much or too little, the fault of quantity should be avoided. || 644 ||

But what is **galantaneha** (easily digestible), that is considered **paṇīta** by the wise. || 645 ||

**312/2.**  Too much or too little, eating in excess.

The *Pinḍanīyukti Bhāṣya* and *Pinḍanīyukti* are two texts that have become one. In the manuscripts, both texts are written together without any instructions. In the published commentary, the editor has numbered the commentary verses before some verses, but this separation does not seem correct. It seems likely that the commentator has numbered the commentary verses before the verses for which he has mentioned the *bhāṣyakāra* and the verses related to them. We have made a primary attempt to separate the commentary and the *nīyukti* verses. During the separation, it was experienced at many places that many verses which are published in the order of *nīyukti* should be of the commentary. Although this work took a lot of time and effort, the number of verses had to be changed many times. The entire text had to be reflected more than a hundred times, yet it cannot be said with certainty that this attempt at separation is completely correct. There are many more possibilities to work in this field. It is certain that this attempt at separation will prove to be a foundation stone for those who will work in this field.

It would have been better to give the commentary verses along with the *nīyukti* verses. This would have also included the numbers of the commentary verses determined in the editing, but due to the non-editing of the commentary, this undertaking was not done for the convenience of the researchers. We have mentioned in detail in the introduction the points on which we have based the separation. The instructions given by the commentator regarding the *bhāṣyakāra* and the commentary verses given in the commentary are being mentioned here.

## Pindaniyukti Bhashya

**1.**
A name derived from a quality is called a *goṇṇa* (secondary) name. The same is considered a *yathaarth* (true) name by those who know the meaning. Based on action, the *yathaarth* names are like *kṣapaṇa* (consumption), *jvalaṇa* (burning), *tapaṇa* (heating), *pavaṇa* (wind), *pradeepa* (lamp), etc.

**2.**
Where the word *piṇḍa* (lump) is used even though there is no combination of many substances, it is called a *samayakṛta* (time-created) *piṇḍa* name. For example, the use of the word *piṇḍa* for water in a sutra.

**3.**
The *tadu-bhaya* (both) *piṇḍa* is the attainment of *guḍa* (jaggery), *odana* (rice), etc., *piṇḍa* by a *sādhu* (holy person) who has entered for the sake of food-gain.

**4.**
Besides the *goṇṇa* and *samayaja* (time-born) names, there is another *lokiya* (worldly) name created by the intention of the self. This is called an *anubhayaja* (experience-born) name, like *sīhag* (lion), *devadatta* (given by god), etc.

**5.**
The name that is devoid of both *goṇṇa* and *samayaja*, i.e., *ubhayatirikta* (beyond both), is indicated by the word *avi* (not) by the *niryuktikāra* (one who defines). An example of an *ubhayatirikta* name is to name a human being *piṇḍa*.

**Notes:**

1. *khavaṇa* (B, A)
2. After this verse, there is a verse in the *k* commentary. The commentator has not explained this verse because it seems to be a repetition of the subject matter of verse 4.
3. *bahuyadvaṇāṁ* (S)
4. *piṇḍapaḍi* (Mu, B)
5. The use of the word *piṇḍa* for water in the absence of a combination of hard substances is meaningless, but it is famous in the *siddhānta* (doctrine), therefore it is also called a *samayaja* name (Mavṛp. 5).
6. Due to the characteristics of *prākṛta* (Prakrit language), the third case is used for the sixth case (Mavṛ).
7. Because it is meaningful and famous in time, it is also called an *ubhayaja* name (Mavṛp. 5).
8. To name someone *sīhag* even though they are devoid of qualities like courage and cruelty, or to name someone *devadatta* even though they were not given by god, is an *anubhayaja* name. This is also called an *ubhayatirikta* name (Mavṛp. 5).
9. There are six *bhāṣyagāthā* (commentary verses) (Pibhā 1-6) in the explanation of *Pini* 5.
10. See *Pini* 5.

6. Even if the meanings are the same, common people do not accept the name that is well-known in time. But they use the name that is well-known to the people, even if it is not well-known in time. ||6||

7. Placing one aksha, varataka, or anguliyaka as a pind is an asadhava establishment. Placing three akshas, three varatakas, or three anguliyakas together in one place as a pind is a sadhava establishment. In chitra karma, establishing a pind from one point is an asadhava establishment. Establishing a pind from many points is a sadhava establishment. Making a pind shape in wood and lepya upala is a sadhava establishment. ||7||

8. Patra, patravarja, patraniryoga, rajoharana, external and internal - these are two nisadyaas. Three pattas - santhar, uttar, and chola patta. The meaning of potti is mukhapotti, mukhavastrika. Rajoharana with one nisadya - all these upadhis are used diligently every day, so there is no need to rest them. ||8||

9. Where there are shatpadikas, they should be transferred elsewhere and these instruments should be washed according to the rules. ||9||

10. These should not be used for twenty days. They should be used diligently every day. If there is doubt, they should be washed according to the rules. ||10||

11. For washing clothes, a sadhu wears the pravarana for three days, then he keeps it close for three days. He wears it for three days, then he keeps it far for one day. ||11||

"Samittāvāyāṇe" means to cause harm or destruction through these three, i.e., body, speech, and mind, or body, life, and senses. 26. 
Body, mind, and speech, or body, life, and senses - the ownership of these three, i.e., the sixth case ending (षष्ठी तत्पुरुष), the fifth case ending (अपदान, पञ्चमी तत्पुरुष), and the third case ending (करण, तृतीया तत्पुरुष) are called "Tripatan". 18. 
Thinking in the heart about one or many virtuous beings, the giver who kills the six bodies is called "Adhakarma". 27. 
The limits of conduct are infinite, and so are the stages of restraint. There are countless "Kandaka" in them. 28. 
There are countless "Kandaka" in the six stages (infinite parts, infinite qualities, etc., six types of increase and decrease). The countless six stages are called the "Samyama Shreni". 29. 

1. For the meaning of "Apdravan", see the second part of the translation of "Pini Ga. 62" - causing harm or destruction through body, speech, and mind, or body, life, and senses.

**21.** The one who consumes food with the karma-prakritis of Krishna, etc., with the characteristics of excellent purity and stability, is considered Adhah-Adhah (one with low purity and low stability). 
**22.** Knowingly killing the six bodies with intention is Nida, and killing them unknowingly is Anida.
**23.** In this context, the division of food is intended to be given as per the need. This division is explained in detail for the benefit of the disciples.
**24.** When a famine has passed, a devotee cooks food for many mendicants who have arrived at the entrance or exit of a desert or on a pilgrimage. This is called Misrajata.
**25.** There are two types of places: 1. Place of the object (Sthan Sthan) 2. Place of the vessel (Bhajan Sthan). The stove (Chulli) and the vessel (Avchulli) are the Place of the object, and the platform (Pithar) and the vessel (Sthali) are the Place of the vessel. The fourfold classification of the Place of the object and the Place of the vessel is as follows:
* Placed on the stove, also on the platform.
* Placed on the stove, not on the platform (because it is placed in a vessel like a pot).

• Not established on the stove, but established on the back (established in the back away from the stove). • Not established on the stove, nor on the back (established in a place like a cupboard away from the stove). If the child cries for food, then give it to him! Don't cry.

**26.**
"If the householder hears you, then the beginning (of violence) will not happen there." (35)

**27.**
"I am spinning cotton right now. After that, I will give you food, so don't cry." (36)
Hearing this statement, the monk should not enter for alms, because there is a possibility of violence (beginning) there. If the mother says, "I am busy with something else, then I will give you food," even then the monk should avoid it. Or, if the child says to his mother when the monk arrives, "Why don't you get up? We will get food because of the monk's influence," even hearing these words, the monk should avoid the offered food.

**28.**
"Even if it is dry, it is washed with water, as people do." (37)
Just as a vessel or object is washed when touched by dry impurity, similarly, a vessel touched by an uncoated, non-violent, non-injurious substance like a thread or a grain, must be purified with the three purifications.

**29.**
"What is said to be taken, even if it is a non-coated substance." (38)
Even if a non-coated, non-violent, non-injurious substance like a thread or a grain is taken, food cannot be considered fit for consumption in that vessel without the three purifications. What to say about a substance like buttermilk, which is coated?

**30.**
"The action that is done for the sake of the monk, is only for the sake of the rice." (39)
In the context of the non-violent, non-injurious rice, etc., prepared for the monk, some say...

It is believed that only Odana is Adhakarma, while the rest like Sauvira, Avshravan and Tandulodak are not Adhakarma, hence they consume them. 31. The Sangam Theras, due to weakness in their legs, abandoned the Gachchha. 
They started living in the nine-part field of Kollikera. 
After some days, the disciple Datta arrived. 
He stayed outside the Upashraya. 
He was mentally disturbed by the unknown Ucchha Bhiksha. 
The Seth's son, Putana, was affected by Vyantari. 
The Acharya said, "Don't cry," and struck the Chapputika, which resulted in the receipt of Bhiksha.

##  Chapter 106: The Arrangement of the Body

**35.** The Acharya, weakened by his emaciated body, resided in the city of Kusumpura. Due to famine, he gave the *Yoini Prabhrit* text to a worthy disciple in seclusion. Two *Ksullaka* monks heard it. Making the disciple an Acharya, he sent him to another country.

**36.** During the famine, even though there was a shortage of alms, the Acharya divided his food with the two *Ksullaka* monks. Later, using *Anjan* (collyrium) to become invisible, the two *Ksullaka* monks began to eat with King Chandragupta.

**37.** Chandragupta felt weakness due to his *Omodariya* (weakness of the stomach). Chanakya asked the reason. He spread fine powder of brick everywhere, closed the door, and filled the place with smoke. Seeing the two *Ksullaka* monks, Chandragupta felt disgust. Chanakya praised him. Approaching them, the Acharya rebuked Chanakya.

**Pindanuyukti-Anuvaad**

1. There are eight types of Pindanuyukti: Udgam (origin), Utpadan (production), Eshana (desire), Sanyojana (combination), Praman (proof), Ingal-Dhoom (smoke) etc. defects and causes of Aahar (food).
2. There are twelve synonyms for the word Pind: Pind, Nikaya, Samuh, Sampindan, Pindan, Samavay, Samavasaran, Nichay, Upchay, Chay, Yugm and Rashi.
3. The word Pind should be explained in four or six ways. After explaining, the form of Pind should be described.

1. This is a collection of verses about the meaning of the text, therefore, only eight meanings related to Pind are mentioned here. The author has explained these meanings in detail.
2. According to the commentator Viracharya, no word can be synonymous with another word in the context of absolute difference, because all substances are completely different from each other. Therefore, the word "Ghat" cannot be synonymous with the word "Kut". Similarly, in the context of absolute non-difference, all substances are in their own form, therefore, the word "Ghat" is synonymous with the word "Ghat", but "Kut" etc. are not synonymous (Av Vr P. 138).

There are twelve words mentioned as synonyms for the word Pind. According to the commentator, all these words are indicative of different groups, but they are considered synonymous because they are generally indicative of the meaning of a group. Pindadayah Shabdaah: Loke Pratiniyat Ev Sanghatavisheshe Rudhah, Tathapi Samanyato Yad Vyutpattinimittan Sanghatatvatvamatra Lakshanan Tat Sarvesham Api Avishistamiti Krutva Samanyato Sarve Pindadayah Shabdaah Ekartheka Uktah Tato Na Kaschiddoshah (Mavru P. 2). The meaning of the words Pind etc. is as follows:

* Pind - To make a Pind by combining many things.
* Nikaya - A group of monks.
* Samuh - A community of humans.
* Sampindan - The proper combination of sesame seeds in a sesame cake.
* Pindan - The combination of substances.
* Samavay - A group of merchants.
* Samavasaran - A council of Tirthankaras, a meeting place of many scholars.
* Nichay - A group of animals like pigs.
* Upchay - Increase in the previous group.
* Chay - The construction of bricks, building a wall etc.
* Yugm - The combination of two substances, the combination of an axle pair etc.
* Rashi - A heap of peanuts etc.

3. The commentator Viracharya has raised a question: How can Pind be formed in a Yugm where there is a combination of two objects? In response, he mentions a specific belief and says that two Bharunda birds who live together for life live in one body, therefore, from this perspective, it becomes a Pind. Mentioning another belief, the commentator says that the combination of three or more substances is primarily called Pind, but the combination of two Kapardikas with different bodies in one place is also called Pind (Av Vr P. 138).

## Chapter 110: The Constitution of a Pind

**3/1.** Just as one *setika* (a unit of measurement) is present in a *kulak* (a larger unit) as its fourth part, similarly four *nikshepas* (deposits) are present in six *nikshepas* by rule. Therefore, six *nikshepas* should be performed. 

**4.** There are six *nikshepas* of the word *pind* (aggregate): *nama* (name), *sthapana* (establishment), *dravya* (substance), *kshetra* (field), *kala* (time), and *bhava* (emotion).

**5.** There are four types of *nama-pind* (name-aggregate): *gauna* (secondary), *samayakrita* (time-established), *tadu-bhayaj* (both-related), and *anubhayaj* (unrelated). Now I will speak about *sthapana-pind* (establishment-aggregate).

**6.** *Sthapana-pind* is of two types: *sadbhavasthapana-pind* (establishment with harmony) and *asadbhavasthapana-pind* (establishment without harmony). Their examples are: *aksha* (axis), *varataka* (a type of wooden stick), *kastha* (wood), *pust* (clay sculpture), and *chitra-karma* (painting) etc.

**7.** *Dravya-pind* (substance-aggregate) is of three types: *sachitta* (conscious), *misra* (mixed), and *achitta* (non-conscious). Each type has nine sub-types.

**8.** These nine sub-types are: *prithvikaaya* (earth-body), *ap-kaaya* (water-body), *tejas-kaaya* (fire-body), *vayu-kaaya* (air-body), *vanaspati-kaaya* (plant-body), *dvi-indriya* (two-sense), *tri-indriya* (three-sense), *chatur-indriya* (four-sense), and *panch-indriya* (five-sense).

**1.** *Gauna-nama* (secondary name) is a name given according to the quality, like the name *Mahavira* for a powerful person. This can be based on both quality and action. The name *gau* (cow) is not based on the quality of being a cow, but on its tendency to move, like *gachchatiti gau* (she who moves is a cow). The commentator *Malayagiri* has divided *gauna-nama* into three sub-types: *dravya-nimitta* (substance-based), *guna-nimitta* (quality-based), and *kriya-nimitta* (action-based). *Dravya-nama* is based on etymology, like *shrungi* (horned), *danti* (toothed) etc. (Mava. P. 3,4).

**2.** *Samayaj* (time-established) is a name that is meaningless but famous in theory. In practice, a group of liquids is not called a *pind*, but the scriptures (Ayarachula 1/7) use the word *pind* for water. Therefore, even in the absence of the synthesis of hard substances, the name *pind* for water is time-established but not meaningful. The name *praabhratika* for cooked rice is also a *samayaj* name.

**3.** *Tadu-bhayaj* (both-related) is a name that is both quality-based and time-established, like the name *Rajoharana* for *Dharmadhwaja*. It is called *Rajoharana* because it removes both external and internal dust. Therefore, the name *Rajoharana* is given by treating the action in the cause.

**4.** *Anubhayaj* (unrelated) is a name that is meaningless and not famous in theory. The commentator has mentioned *ubhayatirikta* (both-exclusive) name for this. The *niyuktikara* (author of the text) has used the word *avi* (not) instead of mentioning the name, like giving someone the name *Singh* (lion) in the absence of courage etc. (Mava. P. 3,4).

The commentator has explained these four names in detail. The commentator has raised a question that there is no special difference between *samayakrita* and *ubhayatirikta* because both names are devoid of meaning. Therefore, instead of mentioning two, only one could have been mentioned. Answering this, the commentator says that common people use the names that are symbolic in the world, but common people do not use the names that are famous in theory, like the use of the word *samuddesha* (purpose) for food. Therefore, both are mentioned separately. Similarly, both *gauna* and *samayakrita* are meaningful names, but common people use *gauna* names, while common people do not use *samayakrita* names, but only those who are contemporary use them (Mava. P. 6).

**5.** Gathering many things together and establishing them is *sadbhavasthapana-pind* (establishment with harmony), and where only one *aksha* or only *varataka* etc. is established as a *pind* in the form of imagination, it is *asadbhavasthapana-pind* (establishment without harmony). Even one *aksha* is made of many atoms, from this perspective, it is a *pind* (Mava. P. 7).

**6.** In *pind-niyukti* (constitution of a *pind*), nine sub-types of *sachitta*, *achitta*, and *misra* *dravya-pind* (conscious, non-conscious, and mixed substance-aggregates) are mentioned, but in *ogha-niyukti* (constitution of a *ogha* (stream)), *lepa-pind* (coating-aggregate) for *patra* (vessel) etc. is accepted as the tenth *achitta* *dravya-pind* (non-conscious substance-aggregate) (Oni 336; Levo Ya Dasamo U).

9. There are three types of *Pṛthvīkāya* - *Sacitta*, *Miśra* and *Acitta*. There are two divisions of *Sacitta Pṛthvīkāya* - *Niścaya Sacitta* and *Vyavahāra Sacitta*. 10. The majority of the great mountains are *Niścaya Sacitta Pṛthvī*, and except for *Acitta* and *Miśra Pṛthvī*, all the earth (like forests etc.) is *Vyavahāra Sacitta Pṛthvī*. 11. The earth beneath trees like *Kṣīradruma*, *Vaṭa*, *Aśvattha* etc., the earth of paths outside *Pantha-grāma* and cities, the land broken by the plough, the earth mixed with water, the earth mixed with fuel, dung etc. are all *Miśra Pṛthvīkāya*. The earth mixed with a lot of fuel remains as *Miśra Pṛthvīkāya* for one *prahara*, the earth mixed with medium fuel for two *praharas*, and the earth mixed with little fuel for three *praharas* (after which it becomes *Acitta*). 12. The *Pṛthvīkāya* becomes *Acitta* due to these things - cold, heat, alkali, *kṣatra*, fire, salt, *ūṣa*, acid, oil etc. The *Pṛthvīkāya* of *Vyutkrānta-yoni* i.e. *Prāsuka* is useful for the *Sādhu*. 13. *Aparāddhika* i.e. blisters caused by the bite of spiders etc. and poison, snakebite etc., *Acitta Pṛthvīkāya* is used for applying poultice and bandages for their relief. *Acitta* salt is taken in food etc. *Acitta* *Surabhi-upala* i.e. the stone called *Gandharohaka* is used for its purpose.

1. Trees like *Vaṭa*, *Aśvattha* etc. are called *Kṣīradruma*. Due to their sweetness, there is a lack of weapons, so some *Pṛthvīkāya* beings remain *Sacitta*, and some become *Acitta* due to contact with weapons like cold etc., therefore, *Miśra Pṛthvīkāya* remains under these trees (M.V.P. 8). 2. When the water of the cloud falls on *Sacitta Pṛthvīkāya*, the water-soaked earth remains *Miśra* for some time. After a short while, it becomes *Acitta* because earth and water are both weapons for each other. As long as it is not completely transformed, the earth remains *Miśra* (M.V.P. 8). 3. Here, the word *Uṣṇa* refers to the heat of the sun. The heat of fire is referred to by the word *Agni* (M.V.P. 8). 4. *Karīṣa* is special (A.V.P. 4). 5. M.V.P. 8; *Ūṣarādi-kṣetra-udbhavo lavaṇi-sammiśro rajo-viśeṣaḥ*. *Ūṣa* - *Ūṣara* is a special type of dust particle produced in the *Ūṣara* field, mixed with salt. 6. The *Acittata* of *Pṛthvīkāya* happens in four ways - 1. *Dravyataḥ* 2. *Kṣetrataḥ* 3. *Kālataḥ* 4. *Bhāvataḥ*. The earth that becomes *Acitta* due to its own body or another body's weapon is *Dravyataḥ*. The earth that becomes *Acitta* due to the contact of earth produced in an alkaline field and earth produced in a sweet field is *Kṣetrataḥ*. Here, the predominance of a particular field is intended. Taking the *Pṛthvīkāya* beyond a hundred *yojanas*, it becomes *Acitta* due to different food and contact with cold etc., this is also *Kṣetrataḥ* *Acittata*. The earth that becomes *Acitta* due to the natural decay of its lifespan is *Kālataḥ*. Only those who are extremely knowledgeable can know this, not the *Chhadmastha*. This is why Bhagavan Mahāvīra did not allow drinking water from a pond with *Acitta* water due to the decay of its lifespan, lest the *Sādhu* who come later drink the water of a *Sacitta* pond. *Bhāvataḥ* *Acittata* means the change in color, taste etc. (M.V.P. 8, 9). 7. M.P. 9; *Surabhy-upalena gandha-pāṣāṇena gandharohaka-ākhyena prayojanam, tena hi pāma-prasat-vāta-ghāta-ādiḥ kriyate*. *Surabhi-upala* i.e. the stone called *Gandharohaka* was used to cure the wind etc. caused by itching.

## 112. Pindaniyukti

Some other uses of achitt prithvi-kay are as follows: 14. Achitt prithvi is used for the discharge of sthana-kayotsarga, nishidan, shayan, uchchar, etc. and for smoothing the ghuttak-lepit patra, the special stone used for smoothing the ghuttak-lepit patra, the stone used for cleaning the apanamarga after the discharge of duglak-uchchar prasravan, and the patra-lep, etc. Thus, achitt prithvi-kay is used in many ways. 15. There are three types of ap-kay: sachitt, mishra, and achitt. There are two types of sachitt ap-kay: nischya sachitt ap-kay and vyavahar sachitt ap-kay. 16. Nischya-sachitt (ekant sachitt) ap-kay is found in the middle of ghanodadhi, ghanavalaya, karak-ola, the sea, and drah. The ap-kay of kूप, वापी, तड़ाग, etc. is vyavaharatah sachitt. 17. Anuvritt ushnajal and rainwater are mishra ap-kay. Except for the three aadesh-matas or paramparas, rice water, which is not very clean, is also mishra ap-kay. 17/1. The three aadesh-matas of tandul-udak are as follows:
* The water droplets that stick to the sides of the vessel when the tandul is washed and transferred from one vessel to another are considered mishra tandul-udak until they dry.
* The bubbles that rise when the tandul is washed and transferred to another vessel are considered mishra tandul-udak until they settle down.
* The tandul-udak is considered mishra until the rice is cooked. (These are the three matas). 1. The sea with the solid ap-kay as its base is the earth of narak.

Usnajal with three boils is considered prasuk. In the first boil, it undergoes some transformation, in the second, it undergoes most of the transformation, and in the third, it is completely transformed into achitt form (Mav P. 10). 4. The rainwater that falls in villages, towns, etc. is not completely achitt due to the contact of humans, tiryanch, etc., and therefore it is mishra. If there is less rainfall outside villages, towns, etc., the water remains mishra when it is transformed from prithvi-kay. When there is heavy rainfall, the initial rainwater remains mishra after being transformed from prithvi-kay, but the later rainwater is sachitt (Mav P. 10). 5. For an explanation of the three aadesh, see the translation of Ga. 17/1. 6. Apte's dictionary (p. 416) mentions four stages of rice:
* Shasya is the rice in the field.
* Dhanu is the rice with husk.
* Tandul is the rice without husk.
* Anna is the cooked rice.

17/2. These three injunctions are non-injunctions because time regulation is not possible in them. The following are the reasons for the absence of definite time - the vessel being rough or smooth, contact with strong or weak wind, and the uncertainty of time in the cooking of rice. 17/3. As long as the rice water is not extremely pure, it is mixed, this is the very proof, not the rest. What is extremely pure (white) should be considered as *achitt*. 18. These things make *apkay* *achitt* - cold, hot, alkali, special *kshatra-karish*, fire, salt, special salt-mixed dust particles produced in *ush-ushar* areas, sourness, *sneha-tail* etc. What becomes *apkay* *vyutkrantayoni* i.e. *achitt*, is used by the virtuous. 19. *Achitt* *apkay* is used in the acts of *parisheka*, drinking, washing hands etc., washing clothes, *achman*, washing vessels etc. 20. During the menstrual period, washing clothes makes the *charitra* weak, destroys *brahmacharya*, the monk is considered to be in an inappropriate place, *sampaatim* and *vayukaya* beings are killed, and the flowing water from washing clothes harms the beings.
21. If clothes are not washed near the rainy season, the following defects arise:
• The weight of the clothes increases. • They become worn out. • *Leelan-phoolan* (moss) grows on the clothes. • Wearing cold clothes causes indigestion, which leads to criticism and slander of the sermon.
1. The disappearance of the point on the vessel, the destruction of the bubble, and the time of the rice being finished is not the same everywhere. The reason for this is that the points on a rough vessel dry quickly, while the points on a smooth vessel take time to dry. Similarly, bubbles disappear quickly in contact with strong wind, not so quickly in weak wind, and due to the difference in water, there is no regularity in the time taken for the rice to cook. Rice cooks quickly in sweet water and takes time to cook in salty water. Similarly, it cooks quickly in a strong fire and takes more time to cook in a weak fire (Mavri p. 10, 11). 2. The *tari* that comes on top of the water kept in a pot of curd or oil, if it is thick, then the *satchitt* water becomes *achitt* in one *paurushi*, if it is medium, then in two *paurushi*, and if it is thin, then in three *paurushi* (Mavri p. 11). 3. Mavri p. 11; *Parisheko-dushtvanaderutthitasya upari paniyena parishechanam* - pouring water over a bad wound. 4. Using water for purification after *uchchar-prasravan*. 5.

There is a contradiction between the life of a householder and the life of a monk.
* Spreading water harms the creatures dependent on the earth.
* 21/1. Even if it is not the rainy season, a monk should carefully wash all his equipment. If water is not available, he should definitely wash the *paatra-niryoga*.
**Explanation**
21/2. The clothes of the Acharya and the *glana* are washed repeatedly because if the Acharya's clothes are not washed, it leads to *avarnavada* (casteism) among people, and if the *glana*'s clothes are not washed, it leads to indigestion and other diseases.
22. There are six types of *paatra-pratyavataara* (i.e., *paatra-niryoga*), two types of *rajo-haran* (dust removal) - external and internal, three types of *patta* (cloth) - *sanstaarak-patta*, *uttar-patta* and *chol-patta*, *potti* (mouth cloth), and *rajo-haran* (dust removal) - these equipment are used daily, so they should not be kept unused. They should be carefully transferred, i.e., the *shat-padika* should be transferred to other clothes and then those clothes should be washed.
22/1. One who keeps the *upaadhi* (body) unused due to the *shat-padika* etc., even when the time for washing is available, should keep the *upaadhi* in this way according to the instructions of the *veet-raag* (liberated soul) by the method of *vishramna* (rest).
1. The meaning of *paatra-niryoga* is - the equipment that helps the *paatra* (monk), such as *paatra-bandh* (container holder), *paatra-sthapan* (container placement), *paatra-kesharika* (container brush), *patala* (cloth), *rajastraan* (dust remover), *gocchaka* (bundle) - all these are *paatra-niryoga*.
*Pattam patta-bandho, paayattavanam cha paayakesariya.
Padalai rayattaan, cha gocchao paay-nijjogo.* (Mavri P. 13)
2. There are two types of *rajo-haran* (dust removal) - 1. *Aabhyantar* (internal) *nishadya* (cloth), which is made of cloth. 2. *Baahya* (external) *nishadya* (cloth), which is made of blanket (Av P. 6).
3. The cloth that covers the mouth, which is four fingers more than a *vitasti* (span) in length, is called *mukha-pottika* or *mukha-vastrika* (mouth cloth) (Mavri P. 13). 4. This verse describes the *vishramna* method in the context of washing clothes. A monk has three *pravaran* (garments) - two cotton and one woolen. One *pravaran* made of *kshoum* (cotton) is always worn close to the body. Above it is the second *pravaran* and above that is the woolen *pravaran*. In the first *vishramna* method, for three days, the cotton cloth worn close to the body should be worn over the other two clothes in such a way that the *shat-padika* (lice) attached to it, due to hunger or cold, move to the other two clothes or the body. This is the first *vishramna* method. After wearing it for three days, it should be kept on the *sanstaarak* (bed) for three nights, so that the *shat-padika* that did not come out of the cloth in the first *vishramna* method, come out for food etc. and attach themselves to the *sanstaarak*. This is the second *vishramna* method. Then, for one night, the cloth should be spread downwards and worn over the body, and *drishti-pratilekhana* (visual inspection) should be done. If the *shat-padika* are not visible after *drishti-pratilekhana*, the cloth should be worn again on the body for the protection of the small lice, so that they attach themselves to the body for food etc. After doing this, *drishti-pratilekhana* should be done again. In this way, *kalpa-shodhan* (purification) takes place in seven days, and then the cloth is washed. This method is now obsolete because due to hygiene, there is a lack of *shat-padika* etc. (Mavri P. 14) See the translation of 22/2, 3.

**22/2.**  The inner garment worn next to the body should be worn for three days, then for three days the garment should be kept far away from the bed, at the edge of the bedspread. Then, for one night, sleep with the garment spread out on the bed, covering the feet. After that, examine the garment with subtle vision. 

**22/3.** According to some Acharyas, (the above three methods of resting the garment) should be followed for three nights and then examined with subtle vision. If no six-legged creatures are seen, the garment should be washed.

**22/4.** (If sufficient water is not available for washing the garment) the Muni should take Nivrodak. Some Acharyas say that the Nivrodak should be taken in their own vessel. Some say that this water is impure, so the Muni should not take it in their own vessel, but in a vessel belonging to the householders. Nivrodak should also be taken after the end of the rainy season. During the rainy season, the water of Nivrodak is mixed. After the rain stops, ash should be added to the Nivrodak so that it does not become sentient again.

**22/5.** The Muni should first wash the clothes of the Guru, then the clothes of the Pratyakhyani-Tapasvis, then the clothes of the Glana, then the clothes of the Shaiksha, and then their own clothes. Among the clothes, first wash the Yathakrut clothes, then the Alpaparikarmiti clothes, and finally the Bahuparikarmiti clothes.

**22/6.** The Muni should not wash the clothes by hitting them on a stone or beating them with wood. After washing, the clothes should not be dried in the heat of fire. The clothes that are used should be dried in the shade, and the clothes that are not used should be dried in the sun. 

**Footnotes:**

1. The seven-day Kalpashodhan method described in verse 22/2 is the same as the three-day method described in this verse. On the first night, the garment to be purified should be worn outside, on the second night it should be placed near the bedspread, and on the third night it should be spread out on the bedspread, facing downwards, covering the body (Mavri P. 15).
2. During the rainy season, the water dripping from the end of the tiles on the roof of the house is called Nivrodak. Due to the contact of dust particles, smoke, blackness, and the heat of the sun, this water becomes sentient (Mavri P. 15).
3. According to the commentator, adding ash makes even dirty water clean (Mavri P. 15).
4. The commentator believes that the water of the Prasauk becomes sentient after three Praharas, so it should be used after adding ash (Mavri P. 15).
5. Yathakrut clothes are those that are free from any kind of work and are obtained in their original form (Mavri P. 15).
6. A garment that has been torn once and sewn back together (Mavri P. 15).
7. According to the commentator, this order of washing clothes is explained due to the pure and holy determination. Alpaparikarmiti clothes are those that cause less hindrance in restraint, study, etc. Yathakrut clothes do not have any work, so they do not hinder restraint, study, etc. Bahuparikarmiti clothes are harmful to study, etc., so they should be washed last (Mavri P. 16).
8. The prohibition of drying in the heat of fire is because the water droplets falling during drying may cause harm to the fire (Mavri S. 16).
9. Even after washing the clothes that are used, there may be living beings like insects, etc., so they should not be dried in the sun (Mavri P. 16).

Dried in the sun. Keep an eye on the dried clothes (so that thieves etc. do not steal them). For the lack of restraint in washing and drying the clothes, the guru should give the disciple a 'Kalyanak' penance. 23. There are three types of Tejaskaay - Sachitt, Mishr and Achitt. There are two types of Sachitt Tejaskaay - Nishchaya Sachitt and Vyavahar Sachitt. 24. Brick kiln, potter's furnace etc. the middle part, electricity and meteor etc. are Nishchaya Sachitt Tejaskaay. Angara etc. are Vyavahar Sachitt Tejaskaay. Fire from a piece of wood etc. is Mishr Sachitt Tejaskaay. 25. Odan, Vyajan, Panak-Kanji water, Aayam-Avshravan, Ushnodak, Kulmash, Dagalak, needle with ash, Pippalak-Kinchit Vakra Kshur Vishesh (scissors) etc. - these are examples of Achitt Agni Kay. Odan etc. are used in food etc. 26. There are three types of Vayukay - Sachitt, Achitt and Mishr. Sachitt Vayukay is of two types - Nishchaya Sachitt and Vyavahar Sachitt. 27. Valayakara Ghanavat' and Tanuvat', Atihim and Atiduridin - the wind caused by these is definitely Sachitt Vay. (In the absence of Atihim and Atiduridin) the wind from the east etc. direction is Vyavaharatah Sachitt. Aakrant etc. wind is Achitt. 27/1. Jinendradev, who churned the eight karmas, has propounded five types of Achitt Vay:
• Aakrant - Wind coming out from the mud etc. trampled by feet.
• Dhmant - Wind coming out from the bellows.
• Ghan - Wind coming out from the sesame crushing machine.
• Dehanugat - Wind released from the anal region.
• Pilit - Wind released by squeezing wet clothes. 27/2. The Drti (whose mouth is tied with a rope) filled with Achitt Vay from the mouth, while flowing in water, remains Achitt Vay for a hundred hands, in the second Hastashat it becomes Mishr and in the third Hastashat it becomes Sachitt, then it remains Sachitt. The Vay in the Vasti or Drti, being in the land
1. Odan to Pippalak - all these were previously transformed into Agni Kay, based on this they are considered Agni Kay. 2. Ghanavat - Dense wind (Mavri P. 17) occurring in the form of a circle below the earth like hell etc. 3. Tanuvat - Liquid wind (Mavri P. 17) occurring in the form of a circle below the earth like hell etc. 4. Darkness arising from the clouds. 5. In Thaan (5/183) there is mention of Sammuchim Vay in place of Ghan, which occurs due to fanning etc.

Based on the time being dry or moist, the air in the body (स्थलस्थ वायु) becomes sentient (सचित्त) according to the day. 28. (In crossing a river etc.) the Muni uses the air in the body (स्थलस्थ वायु) which is situated in the chest (दृति) or the abdomen (वस्ति), or in a particular disease, the air is projected into the region of the anus (अपान प्रदेश). (This is the use of the air in the body) The Muni should avoid sentient (सचित्त) and mixed (मिश्र) air. 29. There are three types of plant bodies (वनस्पतिकाय): sentient (सचित्त), mixed (मिश्र), and non-sentient (अचित्त). There are two types of sentient plants: definitively sentient (निश्चयसचित्त) and practically sentient (व्यवहारसचित्त). 30. According to the definitive view (निश्चयनय), all infinite-bodied plants (अनन्तकाय वनस्पति) are sentient. According to the practical view (व्यवहारनय), all other plants are sentient. Wilted (म्लान) plants and ground rice etc. are mixed plant bodies (मिश्र वनस्पतिकाय). 31. Flowers, leaves, tender fruits, green (हरित) i.e. rice (ब्रीहि), and stalks, if they are wilted (म्लान), are non-sentient (अचित्त) plant bodies. 32. There are many uses of non-sentient plant bodies; for example, as coverings (संस्तारक), vessels (पात्र), sticks (दंडक), cloth (क्षौम), beds (पीढ़), planks (फलक), medicine (औषधि-हरीतकी etc.), and powders of various medicines (भेषज). 33-35. Two-sensed (द्वीन्द्रिय), three-sensed (त्रीन्द्रिय), four-sensed (चतुरिन्द्रिय), and five-sensed (पंचेन्द्रिय) beings are collected together in their respective species in groups of three, and that is called a group (पिंड). Its use is this: the use of two-sensed beings is in the form of conch shells (शंख), oysters (शुक्ति), and cloth (कपर्दक) etc. The use of three-sensed beings is in the form of termite mounds (दीमककृत वल्मीक) etc. 

1. In a solitary and moist time, the air in the body (स्थलस्थ वायु) situated in the chest (दृति) or the abdomen (वस्ति) remains non-sentient (अचित्त) for one prahar. At the beginning of the second prahar, it becomes mixed (मिश्र), and at the beginning of the third prahar, it becomes sentient (सचित्त). In a moderately moist time, it remains non-sentient for two prahars, becomes mixed in the third prahar, and becomes sentient in the fourth prahar. In a slightly moist time, the air in the chest remains non-sentient for three prahars, becomes mixed in the fourth prahar, and becomes sentient in the fifth prahar. The same should be known for dry time. There, instead of prahars, one should increase the number of days. In a slightly dry time, the air in the abdomen remains non-sentient for one day, becomes mixed on the second day, and becomes sentient on the third day. In a moderately dry time, it remains non-sentient for two days, becomes mixed on the third day, and becomes sentient on the fourth day. In a highly dry time, it remains non-sentient for three days, becomes mixed on the fourth day, and becomes sentient on the fifth day (Pibha 12-14, Mavri p. 18). 2. Some parts of the powder may remain unground, so the powder is considered mixed, or some particles of freshly ground flour may remain unprocessed, so it is mixed. 3. There are two types of uses of two-sensed beings etc. for the virtuous: 1. from sound (शब्द) 2. from the body (शरीर). Astrologers consider the sound of the conch shell to be very auspicious, this is the use of two-sensed beings from sound etc. The body is used in three ways: 1. from the whole body 2. from a part of it 3. from another object produced by contact with the body. Pearls are produced by contact with the water that falls in the Swati constellation. The axle and the cloth are used in the establishment of the Samavasarana. The conch shell and the oyster are used to cure eye diseases (Mavri p. 20). 4. The mention of three etc. is by way of example. A group (पिण्ड) is also formed by the union of two (Mavri p. 19). 5. According to the commentator, the word 'परिभोग' here is used in the sense of means of action (Mavri p. 20).

**Pindaniyukti**

This is for the purpose of **pindaniyukti** and **dahopaśaman** (cremation and pacifying the fire) or, as per the physician's advice, for **lep** (ointment) etc. The consumption of **chaturindriya** (four-sensed beings) like **makkhi** (flies) **mal** (excreta, i.e., honey) is for **vaman-nirodh** (stopping vomiting) or the **ashvamaskhika** (horsefly) is used to remove **akshar** (black water) from the eyes. **Panchendriya** (five-sensed beings) are **nairyaik** (useless) in **pind** (body). 36. These are the uses of **tiryanch panchendriya** (five-sensed beings in the animal kingdom) **pind**: **charma** (skin), **asthi** (bone), **dant** (tooth), **nakh** (nail), **rom** (hair), **sing** (horn), **bhed** (sheep) etc. **mingni** (wool), **gobar** (cow dung), **gomutra** (cow urine), and **doodh-dadhi** (milk-curd) etc. 37. (There are three types of humans: **sachitt**, **mishra**, and **achitt**.) The purpose of **sachitt** (conscious) humans is to **pravrajit** (make them renounce the world), guide them on the path when asked, give **bhiksha** (alms) to **munis** (ascetics), provide **vasati** (shelter) etc. The purpose of **achitt** (unconscious) humans is that their skull is ground and used to cure a specific disease related to the **ling** (genitals). The purpose of **mishra** (mixed) humans is that their bones are used to make ornaments, ashes are applied to their bodies, and they are used to ask the way of **kapalik** (skull-wearers). 38. This is the use of **devata** (deities) for **tapasvi** (ascetics), **kshapka** (those who practice severe austerities) etc. **munis** (ascetics) to ask about their **kal-mrityu** (time of death) and about the **shubh-ashubh** (auspicious-inauspicious) aspects of the path. 39. There is also a **mishra pind** (mixed body) of these nine **pind** (bodies) (see verse 8). From **dwik** (two) to **charam** (extreme) **sanyog** (combination), there is a **mishra pind**. 40. These are other examples of **mishra pind**: **sauvir-kanji** (rice gruel), **goras-chhach** (whey), **asav-madya** (wine), **vesan-jira** (gram flour-cumin), **lavan** (salt) etc., **bheshaj-yavagu** (medicinal barley water), **sneh-ghrit** (clarified butter) etc., **shak** (vegetables), **phal** (fruits), **pudgal-pakaya hua mans** (cooked meat), **lavan**, **gudoudan** (sweet rice) - in this way, there are many **mishra pind** due to **sanyog** (combination). 1. The commentator has clearly mentioned the uses of **charma** (skin) etc. **Charma** is used to make **koshak** (containers) to keep **ksura** (razor) etc. The **asthi** (bone) and **nakh** (nail) of **giddha** (vulture) are tied externally to treat **phoda** (boil) in the body. The **daada** (molar) of **shukar** (pig) is used to cure **drishtipusp** (a specific eye disease). The **nakh** (nails) of specific creatures are used for **dhoop** (incense) and **gandh** (fragrance), and also for the treatment of specific diseases. **Rom** (hair) is used to make **kambal** (blankets). The **sing** (horn) is used to call together **marg bhrashta sadhu** (deviated ascetics) and **gomutra** (cow urine) is used for **khujli** (itching) etc. (Mavri P. 20, 21). 2. The commentator mentions another use of the skull, saying that if a king is angry with an ascetic and tries to kill him, the ascetic should take the skull and escape to another country disguised as a **kapalik** (skull-wearer) (Mavri P. 21). 3. The word "**adi**" (etc.) should also include **acharya** (teacher) etc. in addition to **kshapka**. The commentator's opinion is that **devata** (deities) are present in the presence of **kshapka** due to his special **tapovishesh** (austerities), hence the word **kshapka** is used here directly. 4. There are 36 options for **dwik sanyog** (two combinations), 84 for **trik sanyog** (three combinations), 126 for **chatushk sanyog** (four combinations), 126 for **panch sanyog** (five combinations), 84 for **shat sanyog** (six combinations), 36 for **sapt sanyog** (seven combinations), 9 for **asht sanyog** (eight combinations), and 1 for **nav sanyog** (nine combinations) - a total of 502 options (Mavri P. 21). 5. The commentator has explained in detail how many **kay** (bodies) are mixed in **sauvir** (rice gruel) etc. **Sauvir-kanji** is a **pind** (body) of **apkay** (water body), **tejaskay** (fire body), and **vanaspatikay** (plant body) because rice is washed and cooked with water, **avshravan** (residue) is formed by fire, and **tandul** (rice) is used as **vanaspatikay**. Some people also add **lavan** (salt) to it, so there is also a mixture of **prithvikay** (earth body). **Goras-takr** (whey) etc. are a mixture of **apkay** and **traskay** (wind body). **Asav-madya** (wine) is a **pind** of **apkay**, **tejaskay**, and **vanaspatikay** etc. **Vesan** (gram flour) is a **pind** of **vanaspatikay** and **prithvikay** etc. **Bheshaj yavagu** (medicinal barley water) etc. are a **pind** of **apkay**, **tejaskay**, and **vanaspatikay**. **Sneh-ghrit** (clarified butter) etc. are a **pind** of **tejaskay** and **traskay**. **Shak** (vegetables) like **bhathua bharjika** (spinach) etc. are **pind** forms of **vanaspati** (plant), **prithvikay**, and **traskay** etc. (Mavri P. 22).

**41.** Three sky regions, mutually connected, are called a *kṣetra-piṇḍa*. Similarly, there are three time periods, mutually connected, which are called *kāla-piṇḍa*. In terms of space-pervasion and time-based location, the fourth and fifth *piṇḍa*, namely *kṣetra-piṇḍa* and *kāla-piṇḍa*, should be designated. Alternatively, for the sake of convenience, *kṣetra* and *kāla-piṇḍa* should be conceptualized based on "where" and "when" (e.g., this is a *vasati-rūpa kṣetra-piṇḍa*, this is a *pौरुषी-rūpa kāla-piṇḍa*). 

**41/1.** If the *piṇḍa* of concrete substances is designated based on mutual connection and numerical abundance, then the *piṇḍa* of abstract substances is also designated based on mutual connection and numerical abundance. 

**41/2.** Why wouldn't the three-region *skandha*, which are evenly distributed in three regions and connected by continuous relationship, be referred to by the term *piṇḍa*? (Because the basis of the three *paramāṇu-skandha* is the collection of three regions.)

**42.** Alternatively, due to the presence of combination and division, the term *piṇḍa* is appropriate for all four: name, establishment, substance, and emotion. However, (the *kṣetra* and *kāla* are formal *piṇḍa*) the *kṣetra* and *kāla* in which the *piṇḍa* is mentioned are called *kṣetra-piṇḍa* and *kāla-piṇḍa*.

**43.** There are two types of *bhāva-piṇḍa*: *praśasta bhāva-piṇḍa* and *apraśasta bhāva-piṇḍa*. I will describe both separately.

**44.** *Praśasta bhāva-piṇḍa* is of three types: knowledge, perception, and character. Conversely, *apraśasta bhāva-piṇḍa*, which binds the living being to karmas, is of two, four, and seven types.

The **भावपिंड** (emotional state) can be **प्रशस्त** (auspicious) or **अप्रशस्त** (inauspicious) and can be of ten types. The **तीर्थंकर**s have described the ten types of auspicious **भावपिंड**:

1. **संयम** (self-restraint)
2. **विद्या** (knowledge) and **चरण** (action)
3. **ज्ञानादि त्रिक** - **ज्ञान** (knowledge), **दर्शन** (insight), **चारित्र** (conduct)
4. **ज्ञान**, **दर्शन**, **तप** (austerity), and **संयम**
5. Five **महाव्रत** (great vows) - **प्राणातिपात विरमण** (non-violence) etc.
6. **व्रतषट्क** (six vows) including **रात्रि भोजन** (night meal)
7. Seven **पिंडैषणा** (types of food intake), seven **पानैषणा** (types of water intake), and seven **अवग्रहप्रतिमा** (types of dwelling restrictions)

1. **संयम** is **पिंडीभूत** (integrated) in its **पर्यव** (ultimate state) and remains **अविभक्त** (undivided). There is a **तादात्म्य** (identity) relationship between its parts, therefore, despite having **पर्याय** (synonyms), it is a single **पिंड** (entity) and there is no **विरोध** (contradiction) (**मवृ प. 26**).

2. There are seven types of **पिंडैषणा**:

* **असंसृष्टा** - taking food with **असंसृष्ट** (uncontaminated) hands and utensils.
* **संसृष्टा** - taking food with **संसृष्ट** (contaminated) hands and utensils.
* **उपनिक्षिप्तपूर्वा** (**उद्धृता**) - taking food that has been previously removed from a vessel.
* **अल्पलेपा** - taking dry food like **बेर** (jujube) powder, **चावल** (rice) flour, etc.
* **उपहृत भोजनजात** (**अवगृहीता**) - taking food that has been served on a plate for eating.
* **प्रगृहीत भोजनजात** (**प्रगृहीता**) - taking food that is held in the hand.
* **उज्झितधर्मा** - taking food that other **द्विपद** (bipeds), **चतुष्पद** (quadrupeds), or **श्रमण-माहन** (ascetics) would not take (**आचूला 1/140-47**).

3. Similar to **पिंडैषणा**, there are seven types of **पानैषणा**. **पिंड** refers to the intake of food like **अशन** (food), while **पान** refers to the intake of water like **पानी** (water).

In **प्रवचनसारोद्धार** (**गा. 744, टी प. 216**), the author explains the meaning of **अल्पलेपा** under **पानैषणा** as **काजी** (a type of drink), **अवश्रावण** (water dripping from a vessel), **गरम जल** (hot water), **चावलों का धोवन** (rice washing water), etc. are **अलेपकृत पानक** (unmixed drinks), while **इक्षुरस** (sugarcane juice), **द्राक्षा पानक** (grape juice), and **अम्लिका पानक** (sour fruit juice) are **लेपकृत** (mixed drinks).

4. **अवग्रह प्रतिमा** refers to specific rules regarding dwelling or specific restrictions. There are seven types:

* **मैं अमुक स्थान में रहूंगा, दूसरे में नहीं** (I will stay in this place, not in another).
* **मैं दूसरों के लिए स्थान की याचना करूंगा तथा दूसरे द्वारा याचित स्थान में रहूंगा** (I will request a place for others and stay in the place requested by others). This vow is for **गच्छगत साधु** (ascetics who travel).
* **मैं दूसरों के लिए स्थान की याचना करूंगा लेकिन दूसरों द्वारा याचित स्थान में नहीं रहूंगा** (I will request a place for others but will not stay in the place requested by others). This vow is for **यथालन्दिक साधु** (ascetics who stay in one place).
* **मैं दूसरों के लिए अवग्रह की याचना नहीं करूंगा किन्तु दूसरों द्वारा अवगृहीत या याचित स्थान में रहूंगा** (I will not request a place for others but will stay in the place occupied or requested by others). This vow is for **गच्छगत साधु** who practice **जिनकल्प दशा** (a state of austerity).
* **मैं अपने लिए स्थान की याचना करूंगा, दूसरों के लिए नहीं** (I will request a place for myself, not for others). This vow is for **जिनकल्पिक साधु** (ascetics who practice certain austerities).
* **जिसका मैं स्थान ग्रहण करूंगा, उसी के यहां तृण, पलाल आदि से निर्मित संस्तारक आदि प्राप्त करूंगा अन्यथा उत्कटुक या निषद्या आसन में बैठकर रात बिताऊंगा** (I will accept bedding made of grass, straw, etc. from the person whose place I occupy, otherwise, I will spend the night sitting on a **उत्कटुक** (a type of seat) or **निषद्या आसन** (a type of seat)). This vow is for **जिनकल्पिक** or **अभिग्रहधारी साधु** (ascetics who accept certain possessions).
* **जिसका मैं स्थान ग्रहण करूंगा, उसके यहां सहज रूप से बिछा हुआ सिलापट्ट या काष्ठपट्ट उपलब्ध होगा तो प्राप्त करूंगा अन्यथा उत्कटुक या निषद्या आसन में बैठा-बैठा रात बिताऊंगा** (I will accept a **सिलापट्ट** (cotton mat) or **काष्ठपट्ट** (wooden mat) that is readily available at the place I occupy, otherwise, I will spend the night sitting on a **उत्कटुक** or **निषद्या आसन**). This vow is also for **जिनकल्पिक** or **अभिग्रहधारी साधु** (**आचूला 7/48-55**).

##  Chapter 122: Pindaniyukti

**46.** The specific feeling with which the bundle of subtle karmas is bound is called **bhavpind** because it connects those specific karmas with the soul. 

**47.** This **pindaniyukti** involves the **achitt dravyapind** and the **prashastabhavpind**. The remaining terms like **nama** (name) etc. are equivalent to the meaning already explained. They are mentioned to clarify the student's understanding.

**48.** There are three types of **achitt dravyapind**: **ahararup** (food-like), **upadhirrup** (support-like), and **shayyarup** (bed-like). These three are the facilitators and the foundation for the **prashastabhavpind**. In the present context, the purpose of the **achitt dravyapind** is **shuddha ahararup** (pure food-like) from eight sources: **udgam** (origin), etc.

**49.** **Nirvana** is the goal, and its three causes are **jnana** (knowledge), **darshan** (perception), and **charitra** (conduct). The cause of these causes of **nirvana** is **ahar** (food). 

**49/1.** Just as threads are the cause of cloth, and threads are caused by **pakshm** (cotton), similarly, **moksha** (liberation) is the goal, its causes are **jnana** (knowledge) etc., and their cause is **ahar** (food).

**49/2.** Just as an uninterrupted cause completes the entire work, similarly, for the attainment of the **moksha** goal, **avikal jnana** (unwavering knowledge) etc. are the means.

**50.** Thus, I have briefly explained the meaning of the word **pind**. Now, I will explain the meaning of **eshana** (desire) in detail, which is subtle and can be understood by those with sharp intellect.

**51.** These are the synonyms of **eshana**: **eshana**, **gaveshana**, **margana**, **udgopana**.

**52.** There are four aspects of the word **eshana**: **nama** (name), **sthapana** (establishment), **dravya** (substance), and **bhava** (feeling). There are three types each of **dravya** and **bhava** related to **eshana**.

**52/1.** Examples of **eshana**, **gaveshana**, etc. are as follows:
* A person desires the birth of a son, this is **eshana**.
* A person searches for a lost son, this is **gaveshana**.
* A person searches for an enemy based on footprints, this is **margana**.
* A person publicizes the death of his enemy, this is **udgopana**.

**1.** According to the commentator, all four terms **eshana** etc. are synonymous, yet there is a definite difference in their meaning.
* **Eshana**: Expression of mere desire.
* **Gaveshana**: Searching everywhere for an unavailable object.
* **Margana**: Investigating an object with skillful intelligence.
* **Udgopana**: Revealing the desired object to the public. (See translation of 52/1 for clarity of these terms)

**2.** There are three types of **dravya eshana**: **sachitt dravya vishayak** (related to conscious substance), **achitt dravya vishayak** (related to non-conscious substance), and **mishra dravya vishayak** (related to mixed substance). There are three types of **bhava eshana**: **gaveshana** (search), **grahaneshana** (desire to acquire), and **graseshana** (desire to consume).

52/2. Similarly, in the case of four-footed, footless, non-sentient and mixed substances, the words like *aeshanā*, *gaveshanā*, *mārganā* etc. should be combined wherever appropriate. 53/3. The liberated Lord has described three types of *bhavaeṣhanā* in order - *gaveshanā*, *grahanaiṣhanā* and *grāsaiṣhanā*. 52/4. The ungathered lump is not taken and the ungrasped is not consumed. This order of the three *aiṣhanās* should be known. 53. There are four types of *gaveshanā* - name, establishment, substance and feeling. Examples of substance-related *gaveshanā* are the search for deer and elephants. Feeling-related *gaveshanā* is the search for food free from defects like origin, production etc. 53/1,2. King Jitashatru, Goddess Sudarshana, the sight of golden-backed deer in the Chitrasabha, the origin of the *dohad*, weakness due to non-fulfillment, the king's inquiry, the order to the servants to bring the deer. Making *modakas* resembling *Shriprani* fruits and placing them under the *Shriprani* tree. The arrival of deer upon seeing the fruits. This is an example of a proper and improper comparison. The deer who obeyed the leader of the herd lived long, and those who did not obey due to greed were bound in the snare and became victims of suffering. 54. The deer know when the *Shriprani* tree bears fruit? (Even if it bears fruit now, there is no heap of fruits.) If it is said that this happened due to the wind, then the wind also blew in the old days, but there were never so many fruits. 54/1. In the summer, the king wanted to catch elephants. The men filled the pond with water from *arghattas*. Due to excessive water, *nalavana* grew in the pond. Attracted by it, the herd of elephants arrived. 55. The elephants know when and where *nalavana* grows? The pond is filled with water even at other times, but not so full (the elephants who did not go to that pond when the leader of the herd was alert were proper elephants. Those who went there and got caught in the snare were called improper elephants. This is a description of *dravyaeṣhanā*.) 56. *Udgaman*, *udgopana* and *mārganā* are synonymous words. There are four types of *udgaman* - name, establishment, substance and feeling. 57. In substance-related *udgaman*, the example of *laddaka* etc. is given. Feeling-related *udgaman* should be known in three types - object-related, knowledge-related and character-related. In the present context, the context of character-related *udgaman* is relevant.

##  Origin of Substances

57/1.  Astrological bodies like the sun and moon, grass, medicinal plants like rice, clouds, debt, and taxes are the sources of substances. One should describe the origin of these substances, including from where, when, and how they originate. 57/2-4.  The prince, having left his residence, was engaged in play in the court hall. At mealtime, his mother sent him sweets, filled in pots and bowls, as he was fond of them. The prince ate a lot of sweets.  As he remained seated in the court hall, he suffered from indigestion and foul-smelling flatulence. The prince then contemplated the origin of his food: "Sweets are born of three things" - ghee, jaggery, and flour. Their origin is from pure substances. This body is born of two types of impurities - the mother's menstrual fluid and the father's semen. The prince felt detachment. From this, he simultaneously attained right faith, knowledge, and conduct, followed by the attainment of omniscience. 57/5.  Conduct originates from perception and knowledge. Purity of both leads to pure conduct. Conduct leads to purity of karma. In conclusion, purity of origin leads to purity of conduct. 58, 59.  There are sixteen defects of origin: 
1.  *Aadhākarma*
9.  *Apamitya* or *Prāmitya*
2.  *Auddeshika*
10.  *Parivartita*
3.  *Pūtikarma*
11.  *Abhihata*
4.  *Miśrajāta*
12.  *Udbhinn*
5.  *Sthāpanā*
13.  *Mālāpahṛta*
6.  *Prābhṛtika*
14.  *Ācchhedya*
7.  *Prāduṣkaraṇa*
15.  *Anisṛṣṭa*
8.  *Krīta*
16.  *Adhyavapūraka*
60.  One should consider the name of *Aadhākarma*, its meaning, for whom it is done, and its nature. Food taken for the benefit of the householders is not *Aadhākarma*. Food taken for the benefit of the virtuous, etc., is *Aadhākarma*.  There are nine doors to *Aadhākarma*: four transgressions - excess, irregularity, abuse, and misconduct; and two defects in its acceptance - disobedience, etc. 
1.  Astrological bodies and clouds originate from the sky, grass and rice, etc., from the earth, debt from business, and taxes from men appointed by the king.  Astrological bodies, like the sun, originate in the morning, and the rest, like the moon, etc., at other times, according to the time. Grass, etc., originate mainly in the month of Shraavana, etc. Astrological bodies and clouds extend in the sky until late at night, grass, rice, etc., emerge from the earth by breaking it, debt originates from interest, etc., and taxes are collected annually (M.V.P. 33). 2.  See *Parī* : 3 *Kathā Saṅ.* 3 for the expansion of the story. 3.  This is the main gate verse. Its explanation continues until the 92nd (217th) verse.

61. These are the names of *Aadhākarma*: *Aadhākarma*, *Adhaḥkarma*, *Ātmaghna*, *Ātmakarma*, *Pratiṣevṇā*, *Pratiśravaṇa*, *Samvāsa*, *Anumodnā*. 61/1. The bow is the base for *Pratyāñca*, the bull's shoulder is the base for the *Yūpa*, the human shoulder is the base for the *Kāpotī*, the vehicle is the base for the weight of grains etc., and the heart is the base for the worries of family, kingdom etc. All these substances are examples of *Aadhā*. 62. *Aadhākarma* is that which is performed by causing harm and destruction to the beings with generous bodies, with the intention in mind. 63. *Adhaḥkarma* is the downward movement of the substance due to its weight when it is put into water etc., and the descent through a strainer, rope etc. 64. *Adhaḥkarma* is the feeling that lowers the good *Adhyavasaya* present in the special state of *Samyama sthāna*, *Kanda-Samyama śreṇī*, *Leśyā* and good karmas, from the good to the lower. 64/1. The *Muni* present in the state of *Kiñcit* *Nyūna* *Cāraṇāgra* *Upaśānta* *Moha*, by descending his feelings - *Samyama sthāna* - in the soul in a lower and lower form, takes the *Aadhākarma* substance, which also takes his soul down from the lower to the lower.

1. *Aadhākarma* is used due to the faults of *Pratiṣevṇā* etc., therefore, by treating the cause with non-difference, *Pratiṣevṇā*, *Pratiśravaṇa*, *Samvāsa* and *Anumodnā* are accepted as names of *Aadhākarma* (M.V.P. 36). 2. The commentator *Malaya Giri* has raised a question that the generous body is of *Tiryāñca* and human. *Tiryāñca* includes beings from one-sense to five-sense. One-sense includes subtle beings. Due to their subtlety, their harm is not possible by humans, therefore, why are they included here? Answering this, the commentator says that one should know that whoever is not averse to something, even if he does not do that work, he is doing it in the ultimate sense, just as a householder who is not averse to night food, even if he does not eat night food, is still involved in the sin of night food, similarly, a householder is not averse to the harm of subtle one-sense beings, therefore, here, starting for the *Sādhu*, they harm the subtle one-sense beings (M.V.P. 37). The commentator has rejected the subtle one-sense in his explanation (Pibhā 16). 3. The commentator has defined *Uddavaṇa* - *Apadraavaṇa* as pain without excessive harm. For *Sādhu*, when cooking *Śālyodana* etc., all the pain before the harm to the life of the plant is called *Apadraavaṇa* (Pibhā 16), for example, for *Sādhu*, *Śālyodana* is cooked by grinding the *Śāli* twice, until then, the pain caused by grinding is called *Apadraavaṇa*. In the third grinding, the harm to the *Śāli* beings is inevitable (M.V.P. 37). 4. There are countless *Kanda* in the region of the size of a finger, in the amount of a *Rāśi* of parts. *Malaya Giri* has quoted a verse to clarify *Kanda* here - ' *Kaṇḍaṃ ti ittha bhaṇṇai, angulabhāgo asankhejjō* ' (M.V.P. 39). 5. It seems that here, the author has given the example of someone with less character, i.e., someone with *Upaśānta* *Moha* character, to show the terrible nature of the fault caused by *Aadhākarma*. The meaning here is that even a *Sādhu* with *Upaśānta* *Moha* character (eleventh *Guṇasthāna*), let alone a *Pramatta* *Samyata* (sixth *Guṇasthāna*) *Sādhu*, if he takes *Aadhākarma* food, he will fall down his soul (M.V.P. 41).

64/2. A muni who takes *ādhākarma* binds his lifespan to *adhogati* and also directs other karmas towards *adhogati*. He intensifies the karmas bound by intense emotions, accumulating them as *nidhatti* and *nikachana*, constantly choosing and accumulating karmas. 64/3. Due to the arising of these heavy karmas, that *ādhākarma* taking muni cannot save his soul from falling into *durgati*. These karmas take him to *adhogati*. 65. One who takes the life of any of the six living beings, whether intentionally, unintentionally, or unknowingly, is called a *dravya ātmāghna*. 66. The *dravya ātmā* is the six *kāyas*. Knowledge, perception, and conduct - these three are the *bhāva ātmā*. One who is engaged in destroying the lives of beings, destroys his own *bhāva ātmā* in the form of conduct. 66/1. According to *niśchayanaya*, the destruction of conduct leads to the destruction of knowledge and perception. According to *vyavahāranaya*, the destruction of conduct leads to the destruction of knowledge and perception. 67. The man who says, "This is mine," regarding any object, is *mamākāra* *dravya* related *ātmākarma*. And the one who connects himself with the karmas of *parakarma*, *pachan*, *pachana*, etc., by turning into an inauspicious state, is *bhāva* related *ātmākarma*. 67/1. A muni who takes *ādhākarma* and turns it into *dravya* is one with a complex outcome. Even while taking *prāsuka dravya*, he is bound by karmas, therefore, it should be known as *ātmākarma*. 67/2. One who takes *ādhākarma* and consumes it, takes the karmas of *parakarma*, *pachan*, *pachana*, etc., of a householder as *ātmākarma*. The question is, how does *parakriya* transfer elsewhere? 67/3,4. Some people say, based on a hypothetical example, that just as a hunter sets up a trap,

It is the deer who are bound, not the hunter. Similarly, the householder cooks and eats, he is not bound, the customer is bound. (Responding to this doubt) The Guru says - Just as a foolish and unskilled deer is bound in a snare, in the same way, a monk who is bound by evil thoughts is bound in the realm of emotions. Therefore, one should diligently avoid evil thoughts. 67/5. It is agreed that a monk neither performs nor causes the performance of an act of violence, but even knowing about it, if he accepts it, he promotes the act of violence by accepting food. He who does not accept it, prevents it. 68. The monk assimilates the act of violence through serving others, etc. (In verse 61) Among the four terms - serving others, etc., the first term - serving others is the most important, the most significant, the rest are progressively less important. (For example, compared to serving others, listening to others is less important, listening to others is less important than living with others, and living with others is less important than approving of others.) 68/1. I will explain the nature of the doors from serving others to approving of others, with examples, as much as possible. 68/2. One who eats the food brought by another monk, also becomes bound by the sin of serving others. When such a monk is told this, he replies that there is no sin in it, because one who pulls hot coals from another's hand does not get burned himself. 68/3. The monk who eats the food of violence, thinking, "I am pure," is a fool, the one who gives the food of violence is guilty. Not knowing the meaning of the scriptures through this false analogy of hot coals, he serves others. 68/4. The Guru who uses the word "benefit" for the mental concentration of the monk who eats the food of violence at the time of showing alms, and when criticized for saying that such and such a devotee has given this food of violence with devotion, says "good - it was obtained," then such an Acharya is also a participant in the sin of listening to others. 68/5. The well-known meaning of living with others is - to live with those who enjoy the food of violence. Praising the eater of the food of violence is approval. One should know these examples in order. 68/6. The example of a thief should be known in serving others, the example of a prince in listening to others, the example of a merchant living in a village in living with others, and the example of a wicked king in approving of others.
1. This verse mentions a special belief, but it is against the Jain teachings because the householder who initiates the action is bound by karma as a matter of course. If the monk is foolish, then he too is bound by sin by accepting the food of violence, only by using another's action, one is not bound by karma (Mavri P. 45).

68/7,8. Thieves were abducting cows and heading towards their village. On the way, they killed some cows, cooked the meat, and ate it. The meat consumers, the servers who served the meat, and other travelers sitting there - all of them were caught by the king's men who were chasing the thieves. The servers who served the meat and those who held the meat vessels were also bound by the king's men. What to say about the meat eaters? (Similarly, the monks who serve the *Ahadkarma* food and those who hold the vessel for it also receive intense karma-bondage. What to say about the *Ahadkarma* eater?) 68/9. The prince conspired with the ministers for the murder of his father. Some ministers said they would help in the murder of the father, some remained silent. The prince and both types of ministers are guilty of the *Pratiśravaṇa* fault. Those who told the king are not guilty of this fault. 68/10,11. A sage invited four monks to eat *Ahadkarma* food. One sage started eating it. The second said, "I will not eat, you eat." The third monk remained silent. The fourth prohibited it. Among these, the first three monks are guilty of the *Pratiśravaṇa* fault, and the monk who prohibited it is free from that fault. In this context, both the one who brings the *Ahadkarma* and the eater are guilty of *Kāyika* action. The second is guilty of *Vāchika* fault, the third is tainted by *Mānasika* fault, and the fourth is pure from all three faults. 69. For the prince who killed his father, *Pratiśevaṇa*, *Pratiśravaṇa*, *Samvāsa*, and *Anumodana* - all four faults occur. Similarly, all the faults should be combined with the monk who consumes *Ahadkarma*. 69/1. When the king attacked the gang of thieves, some thieves ran away, some merchants did not run away thinking, "We are not thieves." Because of associating with the thieves, the king punished them considering them criminals. 69/2. Similarly, those who associate with the monks who consume *Ahadkarma* food are also guilty. The sight, smell, and discussion of *Ahadkarma* food also affect the monks who are *Rūkshavrutti* and avoid *Ahadkarma*. That monk also starts desiring to consume that food.

1. For the expansion of the story, see *Pari.*-3, *Katha* No. 4. 2. For the expansion of the story, see *Pari.*-3, *Katha* No. 5. 3. All four faults apply to the one who commits *Pratiśevaṇa*. The one who commits *Pratiśravaṇa* has three, the one who commits *Samvāsa* has two, and the one who commits *Anumodana* has one fault (M.V.P. 48). 4. For the expansion of the story, see *Pari.*-3, *Katha* No. 6. 5. *Darśana*, *Gandha*, *Parikatha* - these are three words, their meaning is - seeing *Ahadkarma* food, the smell of that food, and its discussion.

69/3. The person who committed a crime in the king's inner apartments was killed in the middle of the city, along with the ornaments he was wearing when he entered the inner apartments. The king appointed royal officials dressed in Karpataka garments. Those who praised were killed, but those who did not praise were not killed. 69/4. These monks receive timely, respectful, fragrant, delicious, and sufficient food according to the season, therefore they are blessed. Thus, a monk who praises these qualities, even if he does not consume the half-karma, is still tainted by the fault of approval. 70. Just as there is a variety of dishes in half-karma, adha-karma, atmaghna, and atma-karma, is there also a variety of meanings? When asked this, the Acharya says 70/1. There are four categories of dishes and meanings:
1. One meaning, one dish. 2. One meaning, many dishes. 3. Many meanings, one dish.
4. Many meanings, many dishes. 70/2. In the world, words with one meaning and one dish are prevalent, such as - ksheer-ksheer. Words with one meaning and many dishes, such as - dugdha, payah, pilu, ksheer, etc., for the meaning of milk. 70/3. A word with one dish and many meanings, such as - the use of the word ksheer for the milk of a cow, buffalo, and goat, etc. Many meanings and many dishes, such as - ghat, pat, kat, shakat, rath, etc. names. 70/4,5. The use of the word adha-karma, adha-karma by two, three, or more people for one thing, this is the first category (one meaning and one dish); adha-karma, adha-karma, atmaghna - these are one-meaning words with many dishes, this is the second category, such as - shakra, indra, etc., one-meaning words with many dishes. 1. For the expansion of the story, see Pari.-3, Katha San. 7. 2. According to the commentator, the fault arising from approval is acceptable by treating the cause in the action (Mavri P. 50). 3. In Vyavahar Bhashya, there is a mention of four categories of dishes and meanings and their examples in the following two verses. These verses have differences in word division and examples, but the meaning is the same.
Naanatam dissae atthe, abhinne vanjanammi vi. Vanjanassa ya bhedammi, koi attho na bhijhati || Padhamo tti ind-indo, bitiyao hoi ind-sakko tti. Tatiyo go-bhoop-pasu, rassi charamo ghad-pado tti ||
(Vyabha 155, 156) 70/1-3- These three verses are very important from the point of view of linguistics. The words adha-karma, adha-karma, atmaghna, and atma-karma, etc., are included under the second category, one meaning and many dishes.

There are four types of food: Asan, Pan, Khadim, and Swadim. Using the term Adhakarma for all four types of food is the third type of Bhang (Nana Artha Ek Vyanjan). In the context of Adhakarma, the fourth type of Bhang (Nana Artha Nana Vyanjan) is nonexistent. 70/6. Just as words like Purandar etc. do not transgress the meaning of Indra, similarly words like Adhakaram, Atmaghna etc. do not transgress the meaning of Adhakarma. 71. The one who consumes Adhakarma causes the downfall of his own soul (hence one name is Adhakaram). He destroys the virtues like character of the soul along with the killing of living beings and ghosts, hence one name is Atmaghna. The one who takes Adhakarma takes upon himself the sinful karma of Parakarma-Pachak etc., hence one name is Atmakarma. 72. When a disciple asks which particular man's karma is called Adhakarma, the answer is that the karma done for a Sadharmik is called Adhakarma, hence the word Sadharmik should be properly defined. 73. There are twelve types of Sadharmik: 1. Naam Sadharmik 7. Ling Sadharmik 2. Sthapana Sadharmik 8. Darshan Sadharmik 3. Dravya Sadharmik 9. Gyan Sadharmik 4. Kshetra Sadharmik 10. Charitra Sadharmik 5. Kaal Sadharmik 11. Abhigrah Sadharmik 6. Pravachan Sadharmik 12. Bhavana Sadharmik 73/1-3. Naam Sadharmik - A person with the same name. Sthapana Sadharmik - The establishment of a Sadharmik in a wooden statue, axis etc. Dravya Sadharmik - Having a Pravardhman body, this will be the Sadharmik of the Sadhu in the future (or the dead body of the Sadharmik). Kshetra Sadharmik - Born in the same area. Kaal Sadharmik - Born in the same time.

1. Although the fourth Bhang is nonexistent here, according to the commentator, if someone uses Adhakarma for Asan, Adhakaram for Panak, Atmaghna for Khadim, and Atmakarma for Swadim, then these names become Nana Artha and Nana Vyanjan. From this perspective, the extreme Bhang can also be achieved (Mavri P. 51). 2. The Nishita Bhashya mentions three types of Sadharmik: 1. Ling Sadharmik 2. Pravachan Sadharmik 3. Ling-Pravachan Sadharmik. There, three divisions of Sadharmik are also made alternatively: 1. Sadhu 2. Parswasth 3. Shravak. The second alternative is: 1. Shraman 2. Parswasth Shraman 3. Shravak (Nibha 336 Chu. P. 117).

**Pravachan Sadharmic** - A member of the fourfold assembly (Tirth Chatushtaya). **Ling Sadharmic** - One who adopts the same attire as a Muni, such as the removal of hair, mouth-covering, etc. **Darshan Sadharmic** - One who shares the same philosophy. There are three types of Darshan. **Gyan Sadharmic** - One who shares the same knowledge. There are five types of Gyan. **Charitra Sadharmic** - One who shares the same conduct. There are five or three types of Charitra Sadharmic. **Abhigraha Sadharmic** - One who shares the same acceptance. There are four types of Abhigraha Sadharmic. **Bhavana Sadharmic** - One who shares the same feelings. There are twelve types of Bhavana Sadharmic based on twelve feelings like impermanence, etc. 6 73/4, 5. (The method of determining Nam Sadharmic) - Someone's father's name was Devadatta. Upon his death, his son vowed that he would offer food, etc., to anyone named Devadatta, whether a householder or a monk. In such a situation, the vow does not apply to Munis named Devadatta. If the householder vows to offer food to all householders named Devadatta, then the vow applies to monks named Devadatta. Similarly, in the case of monks belonging to heterodox sects, one must understand the concept of mixed and unmixed.

1. The commentator Malayagiri, quoting the commentary of the Purvacharya, states that there are 21 distinctions arising from the combination of two out of the seven categories of Pravachan, Ling, etc. There are six divisions of Pravachan, Ling, Darshan, etc., up to Bhavana. There are five divisions of Ling with Darshan, etc., four divisions of Darshan with Gyan, etc., three divisions of Gyan with Charitra, etc., two divisions of Charitra with Abhigraha and Bhavana, and one division of Abhigraha with Bhavana - thus, there are twenty-one distinctions in total. Each of these twenty-one distinctions has four divisions (Mavri P.55). 2. Three types of Darshan Sadharmic - 1. Kshayik Darshan Sadharmic 2. Kshayopa-shamic Darshan Sadharmic 3. Aupa-shamic Darshan Sadharmic. (One who holds the Kshayik Darshan is a Sadharmic of the Kshayik Darshani). 3. Five types of Gyan Sadharmic - 1. Mati Gyan Sadharmic 2. Shruta Gyan Sadharmic 3. Avadhi Gyan Sadharmic 4. Manahparyav Gyan Sadharmic 5. Keval Gyan Sadharmic. 4. Five types of Charitra Sadharmic - 1. Samayik Charitra Sadharmic 2. Chhedopasthapaneya Charitra Sadharmic 3. Parihar Vishuddhi Charitra Sadharmic 4. Sukshma Samparaya Charitra Sadharmic 5. Yathakyat Charitra Sadharmic. According to other opinions, there are also three types of Charitra Sadharmic - 1. Kshayik Charitra Sadharmic 2. Kshayopa-shamic Charitra Sadharmic 3. Aupa-shamic Charitra Sadharmic. 5. Four types of Abhigraha Sadharmic - 1. Dravya Abhigraha Sadharmic 2. Kshetra Abhigraha Sadharmic 3. Kal Abhigraha Sadharmic 4. Bhav Abhigraha Sadharmic. 6. Twelve types of Bhavana Sadharmic - 1. Anitya Bhavana Sadharmic 2. Asharanatva Bhavana Sadharmic 3. Ekatva Bhavana Sadharmic 4. Anyatva Bhavana Sadharmic 5. Ashuchitva Bhavana Sadharmic 6. Sansar Bhavana Sadharmic 7. Ashrava Bhavana Sadharmic 8. Sanvar Bhavana Sadharmic 9.

## 132. Pindaniyukti

It is necessary to understand the rules regarding Pindaniyukti (offering food). If a householder has made a vow to offer food to a Shraman (Jain monk) or Sadhu (holy person), then that food is not considered suitable for a Sadhu with a different name, even if they are of the same sect. (73/6)

This distinction should be made in relation to the offering of food to a Sadharmic (fellow Jain) based on whether the offering is Nishra (with a specific intention) or Anishra (without a specific intention). In the case of a Sadharmic, one should avoid offering food like Upaskat (food offered to a guest) near the body of a deceased Sadhu, as it would lead to criticism in the world. (73/7)

Just as we have discussed the distinction between Pashandi (non-Jain) and Shraman in terms of Mishra (mixed) and Amishra (unmixed) intentions, we should also understand the same distinction in relation to the place and time of the offering.

1. **Pashandi:** The commentator explains the distinction between Mishra and Amishra in relation to Pashandi as follows: If a householder vows to offer food to all Pashandi named Devadatta, this is a Mishra vow. This vow does not include a Sadhu named Devadatta, as the vow encompasses all Pashandi named Devadatta, including Sadhus. However, if the vow is to offer food to all Sarjask Pashandi (Buddhist) named Devadatta, then this vow includes a Sadhu named Devadatta. Just as we have explained the distinction between Mishra and Amishra in relation to the word Pashandi, we should also apply the same distinction to the word Shraman.

There are five types of Shraman: Nirgranth, Shaky, Tapas, Gairik, and Ajivika. If a householder makes a Mishra vow to offer food to all Shraman named Devadatta, then this vow does not include a Sadhu named Devadatta. However, if the householder vows to offer food to all Shraman except Nirgranth Sadhus, then this vow includes a Sadhu named Devadatta. If someone vows to offer food to all Sanayats (ascetics) named Devadatta, then this vow does not include a Sadhu named Chaitra, as the vow is specifically for Sadhus named Devadatta. The commentator further explains that if the vow is made in the name of a Tirthankara or Pratyekabuddha, then the food is considered suitable for a Sadhu, as Tirthankaras and Pratyekabuddhas are beyond the Sangha (community) and are not considered Sadharmic to Sadhus. (Mav P. 53, 54)

2. **Pratikruti (Replica):** If a householder, out of affection, makes a replica of their deceased or living father and prepares an offering for them, it can be of two types: Nishrakrut and Anishrakrut. If the householder vows to offer the offering to the replica of their father who is a Rajoharan (one who has renounced worldly possessions), then it is called Nishrakrut. If the offering is prepared without any specific vow, then it is called Anishrakrut. Nishrakrut offerings are not considered suitable for a Sadhu. Anishrakrut offerings are considered suitable, but the Acharyas (teachers) have prohibited them because they are against social norms.

Similarly, the food prepared for a deceased Sadhu's body is called Mritatanubhakt. This is also of two types: Nishrakrut and Anishrakrut. If the offering is prepared with the vow to offer it to a Sadhu, then it is called Nishrakrut. If the offering is prepared without any specific vow, out of mere filial piety, then it is called Anishrakrut. Nishrakrut offerings are not considered suitable for a Sadhu. Anishrakrut offerings are considered suitable, but they are criticized in the world, as people question the Sadhu's conduct for not avoiding such offerings. Therefore, a Sadhu should avoid such offerings. (Mav P. 54)

3. **Desha (Place):** If a householder vows to offer food to Pashandi born in the Saurashtra region, then this vow does not include a Sadhu born in the Saurashtra region, but it does include a Sadhu born in another region. (For further details, see Mav P. 55, Ga. 73/4, 5 commentary)

4. **Kala (Time):** If a householder vows to offer food to Pashandi born on a specific day, then this vow does not include a Sadhu born on that day, but it does include Sadhus born on other days. (Mav P.

73/8. Those Śrāvakas who are in the tenth Śrāvaka pratima are with braided hair. They are of the same dharma due to their teachings, not due to their gender and attire. Nihnvas are of the same dharma due to their gender but not due to their teachings. 73/9. Those Śrāvakas and Sadhus who are endowed with various Kṣayika etc. Samyaktva are of the same dharma due to their teachings, not due to their vision. Tīrthankaras and Pratyekabuddhas are of the same dharma due to their vision, not due to their teachings. 73/10. Similarly, one should know the relationship of knowledge and conduct with teachings. They are of the same dharma due to teachings but not due to their possessions; for example, the possessions of Śrāvakas and Munis are different. 73/11. Nihnvas, Tīrthankaras and Pratyekabuddhas - all three are of the same dharma due to their possessions, not due to their teachings. Similarly, one should know the fourfold truth of teachings and contemplation. Now I will tell the remaining examples of the fourfold truth. 73/12. Similarly, with terms like gender-based samādharma, vision-based samādharma etc., one should combine each term like gender etc. with the fourfold truth of superior terms like vision, knowledge etc. Those fourfold truths which are not similar to others in terms of examples should be discarded, and the remaining options should be known in the same way. 73/13. In this division of the fourfold truth, where one is of the same dharma due to gender but not due to vision, Nihnvas and Pratima-dhari Śrāvakas with different visions come. The food prepared for them is conceivable for a Sadhu but not prepared for a Sadhu. In this second division, where one is of the same dharma due to vision but not due to gender, Pratyekabuddhas, Tīrthankaras and ordinary Śrāvakas come. The food prepared for them is conceivable for a Muni.

1. The fourfold truth based on teachings and gender is as follows:
• Of the same dharma due to teachings, not due to gender.
• Of the same dharma due to gender, not due to teachings.
• Of the same dharma due to teachings, also of the same dharma due to gender.
• Neither of the same dharma due to teachings nor of the same dharma due to gender.

In Vyavahāra-bhāṣya, the corresponding verse of this verse is found as follows:
"All Nihnvas are of the same dharma due to gender, not due to teachings.
But those who are of the same dharma due to teachings, are not of the same dharma due to gender with braided hair." (Vyabhā 991)

The commentator, while explaining this verse, says that if one Sadhu or Śrāvaka is endowed with Kṣayopashamika vision and the other is endowed with Aupaśamika or Kṣayika Samyaktva, then they are of the same dharma due to teachings, not due to vision (Mavṛ P. 56).

3. Just as the four divisions of gender and vision have been mentioned with examples (verse 73/13), similarly, there are options for gender and knowledge, and gender and conduct. Leaving those aside, one should mention the options for gender and vision, and gender and possessions.

4. The author has mentioned only two divisions. The commentator has explained the examples of the remaining two divisions. In this division, where one is of the same dharma due to gender and has the same vision, Sadhus and Ekādaśa Pratima-dhari Śrāvakas come. In this, the food prepared for the Śrāvaka is conceivable, but not conceivable for the Sadhu. In the fourth division, where one is neither of the same dharma due to gender nor due to vision, Pratyekabuddhas, Tīrthankaras and Śrāvakas without Pratima come. The food prepared for them is conceivable for a Sadhu. The commentator has also described in detail the fourfold truth of gender and knowledge, gender and conduct etc. (For details, see Mavṛ P. 57, 58).

**73/14.** In this first division, those who are similar in **linga** but not in **abhigraha** are included. These include various **abhigraha**-holding **sadhus**, **pratima-pratipanna** **shravakas**, and **nihnvas**. For **nihnvas** and **shravakas**, **krita aahar** is **kalpanya** for **sadhus**. In the second division, those who are similar in **abhigraha** but not in **linga** are included. These include all **buddhas**, **tirthankaras**, and **pratima-rahit** **shravakas**. For them, **krita aahar** is **kalpya** for **sadhus**.

**73/15.** Just as there are four divisions based on **linga** and **abhigraha**, there are also four divisions based on **linga** and **bhavana**. In the first division of the four divisions based on **darshan** and **gyan**, those who are similar in **darshan** but not in **gyan** are included. These include **sadhus** and **shravakas** with different **gyan** but similar **darshan**. For **shravakas**, **krita aahar** is **kalpya**. Similarly, the second division should be understood as those who are similar in **gyan** but not in **darshan**.

**73/16.** In the four divisions based on **darshan** and **charitra**, the first division includes those who are similar in **darshan** but not in **charitra**. These include **shravakas** with similar **darshan** and **sadhus** with different **charitra**. (For **shravakas**, **krita aahar** is **kalpanya** for **sadhus**, but it is not **kalpanya** for **sadhus** themselves.) The second division includes those who are similar in **charitra** but not in **darshan**. These include **sadhus** with different **darshan** and similar **charitra**. (For them, **krita aahar** is not **kalpya**.) Now I will speak about **darshan** and **abhigraha**.

**73/17.** **Shravakas** and **sadhus** with similar **darshan** and different **abhigraha** are similar in **darshan** but not in **abhigraha**. This is the first division. In the second division, those who are similar in **abhigraha** but not in **darshan** are included. This also includes **sadhus** and **shravakas**. These **sadhus** and **shravakas** have different **darshan** and similar **abhigraha**. (The commentator has also explained the last two divisions.) The four divisions based on **darshan** and **bhavana** should also be understood in the same way. The four divisions based on **gyan** and **charitra** etc. should be understood. Now I will speak about the four divisions based on **charitra** and **gyan** etc.

**1.** Malayagiri, presenting the views of some **acharyas**, said that eleven **pratima-pratipanna** **shravakas** are like **sadhus**, and therefore, **krita aahar** for them is not **kalpanya** for **sadhus**. The commentator refuted this view and, quoting the original commentator, said that **krita aahar** is **kalpanya** for **sadhus** for eleven **pratima-pratipanna** **shravakas** who have **linga** (Mavri p. 62).

**2.** In the **gatha**, the **niyuktikara** has only explained two divisions, but the commentator has explained all four divisions. The third division includes those who are similar in **linga** and also similar in **abhigraha**. This includes **sadhus**, eleven **pratima-pratipanna** **shravakas**, and **nihnvas**. For **shravakas** and **nihnvas**, **krita aahar** is **kalpanya** for **sadhus**. The fourth division includes those who are neither similar in **linga** nor in **abhigraha**. This includes **tirthankaras**, all **buddhas**, and eleven **pratima-rahit** **shravakas** with different **abhigraha**. For them, **krita aahar** is **kalpya** (Mavri p. 58).

**3.** For further explanation of this fourfold division, see Mavri p. 58.

**4.** The commentator has also mentioned the third and fourth divisions (see Mavri p. 59).

73/18. In the first division, monks with similar conduct but different vows come. In the second division, monks with similar vows but different conduct come, including Nihnvas, Shravakas, and monks. (Here, the food prepared for Shravakas and Nihnvas is considered acceptable.) Similarly, one should understand the four divisions of conduct and emotions. Now I will speak of the four divisions related to vows and emotions. 73/19. In these two divisions, monks, Shravakas, and Nihnvas are included, where vows are similar but emotions are different, and emotions are similar but vows are different. Food prepared for the common knowledgeable person is not considered acceptable for other monks. Food prepared for the Tirthankara and the Pratyekabuddha is considered acceptable for other monks. 73/20. Similarly, there are four divisions of Darshan (vision) etc. with Ling (gender). In the first three divisions, it is acceptable, but the last division should be avoided. 73/21. One should plan the options (based on Darshan, Gyan, Charitra, Abhigha, and Bhavana) according to the Kshayik (temporary) emotions etc. of each Pratyekabuddha, Nihnva, Upasaka, Kevali, and other monks. 73/22. Where the third division is similar in terms of preaching and Ling, food is not considered acceptable for the monk. (In this option, all monks except the Pratyekabuddha and Tirthankaras are included.) In the remaining three divisions, it is acceptable sometimes, sometimes not. Food prepared for the Tirthankara and Kevali is considered acceptable. Food and water prepared for other monks is not considered acceptable. 74. When asked by the disciple about the nature of Adhakarma, the Acharya explains the components of Adhakarma, such as food and drink, to explain its nature. 75. Food includes rice etc., drink includes water from wells etc., Khadim includes fruits etc., and Swadim includes ginger etc. Based on the concepts of "Krit" (prepared) and "Nishthit" (established), there are four divisions: pure and impure.

The commentator has also explained the last two divisions (see Mavri p. 61). 2. Deities create Samavasaran etc. for the Tirthankara, and monks go there to listen to the Dharma-Deshana. Similarly, the food prepared for the Tirthankara is also considered acceptable for the monks. The Tirthankara and Pratyekabuddha have risen above all Kalpas (time periods), perhaps this is why this rule is established. (Mavri p. 61) According to Bribha, the Tirthankara is not similar to anyone, therefore, the food prepared for them is considered acceptable for the monks (Bribha 1782, T p. 526). 3, 4. While explaining why the words Tirthankara and Kevali are used in the verse, the commentator says that the Tirthankara's attainment of Kevalgyan becomes known to everyone, but it is not necessary for everyone to know about the Kevali's Kevalya, therefore, both Tirthankara and Kevali are considered separately. The word "Tirthankara" also includes the Pratyekabuddha by implication. (Mavri p. 62) The words Nihnva and Upasaka are used in the Jitakalp Bhashya (Jibha 1145). 5, 6. For the four divisions of Krit and Nishthit, see the translation of verse 80, 80/1.

76. In the village, there was an abundance of Kodrava and Ralak grains, so those were the only things available for alms. The monks had a pleasant dwelling suitable for their studies. The monks arrived for the purpose of marking the territory. The lay devotees asked, "Is this area suitable for the Acharya's Chaturmas?" The monks, with honesty, told them everything. 76/1. "The area is suitable for the Gan, but not for the Guru's Chaturmas, because there is no Shalyodana suitable for the Acharya here." Hearing this, the lay devotee sowed Shali seeds and distributed the Shali to his relatives' homes. 76/2, 3. As time passed, they or some other monks, while wandering, came to that village and went for alms. They were filled with desire. They heard this discussion from the mouths of the children. Some children were saying, "These are the monks for whom Shalyodana is made in every house." Another said, "Mother gave me Shalyodana for the monks." A donor said, "I gave Shalyodana for others, now I want to give my own." A child said, "Give me Shalyodana for the monks." A poor man said, "There was a lack of Odana here, so Shalyodana happened on the occasion." 76/4. (The wife of the younger brother died in two brothers) The elder brother's wife said to her brother-in-law, "My husband and your wife have died, so I want to become your wife. This is an example of 'Thhakke Thhakkaavdiyan', meaning things happening according to the occasion." 76/5. A child said, "Mother! Give the monks Tandulodak." Another said, "Give the monks Shalikaanjik." Hearing this from the mouths of the children, the monks asked, "What is this?" Knowing the whole story, the monks, knowing it was Adhakarma Ahar, rejected those houses and started wandering for alms in other houses.

77. In one village, all the wells were of salty water. Once, a lay devotee dug a well of sweet water and covered it with planks, etc., until the monks arrived.

78. Regarding Khadim substances like cucumber, mango, pomegranate, grapes, and Bijoura, there can be a tendency towards Papakaran. For Swadim substances like Trikatuk, etc., the lay devotee also commits many sinful tendencies.

79. Making the four types of Asan, Pan, etc., which are Sachitt, suitable for the monks to consume, i.e., making them Prasauk, is called 'Nishthit'. Starting to serve these four is called 'Kat'.

Here, the author has given an example of a worldly event in the middle to explain 'Thhakke Thhakkaavdiyan' - things happening according to the occasion. This seems irrelevant in the context of the children's discussion. 2. See Pari. 3 Katha San. 8 for the expansion of the story. 3. This is an example of Adhakarma related to Pan. See Pari. 3 Katha San. 9 for the expansion of the story. 4. Trikatuk - ginger, peepal, black pepper, etc.

**80.** Rice that has been washed three times is considered "**niṣṭhita**" (purified), and rice that has been washed once or twice is considered "**kṛta**" (prepared). The **Tīrthaṅkaras** have considered **niṣṭhita kṛta** rice as having two **ādhākarma** (impurities): one **ādhākarma** due to the **kṛta** rice form and the other **ādhākarma** due to the cooking process. 80/1. Some **Ācāryas** prohibit sitting under the shade of a tree planted for the benefit of a **sādhu** (monk) for the purpose of enjoying fruits, flowers, or any other reason. However, this is not appropriate. It is conceivable to consume the fruit of that tree in a different **bhaṅga** (state), i.e., as "**kṛta**" for the **sādhu** and "**niṣṭhita**" for the **gṛhastha** (householder). 80/2. The shade of a tree is not **ādhākarmic** because the shade is **parapratyayika** (dependent on something else), i.e., it is caused by the sun, not solely by the tree. Just as a **mālākara** (gardener) cultivates a tree, the shade is not cultivated by the tree. Those who prohibit sitting under the shade of a tree, considering it **ādhākarmic**, would then consider it permissible to sit under that tree when the shade disappears due to the sky being covered by clouds. 80/3. The shade increases and decreases. The increasing shade of a tree touches many houses. It is not conceivable that all those houses and food would become impure due to **pūti doṣa** (impurity). (This is not mentioned in the **Āgamas**). The sun does not cause the shade for the **munis** (ascetics) who are **suvihit** (well-behaved), it occurs naturally. Therefore, it is not **ādhākarmic**. 80/4. When scattered clouds move across the sky, the shade disappears and reappears during the day. When the sun is covered by clouds, it is permissible to sit under the tree, but it should be avoided during the heat of the sun. (This fact is neither mentioned in the **Āgamas** nor recorded by the **pūrvapurṣas** (predecessors), therefore it is false). 80/5. Thus, this fault related to shade is not possible. It is free from **ādhākarma**. Even so, those who are very compassionate and avoid it are not at fault.

**81, 81/1.** **Gṛhasthas** are considered **paraphakṣa** (other party) and **śramaṇas** and **śramaṇīs** (monks and nuns) are considered **svaphakṣa** (own party). What is cooked and prepared is considered "**niṣṭhita**", everything else is "**kṛta**". For a **sādhu**, "**kṛta**" and "**niṣṭhita**" are permissible, and for a **gṛhastha**, 

1. The commentator **Malayagiri** mentions the **Vṛddha-sampradāya** (ancient tradition) in this context, stating that if rice is washed once or twice for the **sādhu** and a third time by the **gṛhastha** for themselves and cooked, then that rice is permissible for the **sādhu**. Other traditions are also mentioned in this context. One should understand **kṛta** and **niṣṭhita** in relation to **pān** (betel leaf), **khādim** (vegetables), and **svādim** (tasty food). If a well is dug for a **sādhu**, water is drawn from it, and it is prepared for drinking, then it is called "**kat**" until it is prepared for drinking, and after it is prepared for drinking, it is called "**niṣṭhita**". Similarly, in **khādim**, when cucumbers, etc., are sown and harvested, and then cut into pieces, those pieces are called "**kṛta**" until they are prepared for eating, and after they are prepared for eating, they are called "**niṣṭhita**" (**M.P. 65, 66**). 
2. According to the commentator, some parts of the ground under a tree are contaminated with **saccitta kaṇas** (sentient particles), therefore it is impure. It is not permissible to sit in that place, but the shade of the tree is not **ādhākarmic** (**M.V.P. 66**).

For a 'Krit' Sadhu, there are four 'Nishthit' categories. The second and fourth categories are conceivable, such as:
* Krit for Sadhu, Nishthit for Sadhu.
* Krit for Sadhu, Nishthit for Grihasth.
* Krit for Grihasth, Nishthit for Sadhu.
* Krit for Grihasth, Nishthit for Grihasth.

## 82. There are four faults related to Adhakarma: Atikram, Vyatikrama, Atichar, and Anachar. One should know the demonstration of these four. The first is Atikram, meaning invitation for Adhakarma.
## 82/1. A new Shravak invites a Muni to donate Shali, Ghrit, Gud, Goras, and new Valli fruits that are not suitable for a Muni.
## 82/2. A Muni who accepts and consumes Adhakarma, consumes all four faults, including Atikram. The example of Nupurharika is relevant here. In the Nupurharika story, the king's elephant raises one, two, three, and then all four legs.
## 82/3. One who accepts the invitation for Adhakarma commits the fault of Atikram. Raising the leg to bring it is the fault of Vyatikrama. Accepting the Adhakarma in a vessel is the fault of Atichar, and swallowing it is the fault of Anachar.

## 83. As previously stated (Ga. 60), there are faults like Agyabhang, etc., in accepting Adhakarma. These faults are: Agyabhang, Anvastha, Mithyatva, and Viradhana.
## 83/1. One who accepts Adhakarma due to greed for food, etc., violates the commands of all Tirthankaras. One who violates the command, by whose command does he follow the remaining rituals?
## 83/2. If one Muni performs an inappropriate act (consumes Adhakarma), other Munis, based on their faith, start performing the same act. This way, due to the tradition of many Munis, restraint and penance are broken, leading to the breaking of the Tirth. (This is an example of the fault of Anvastha.)

1. For detailed explanation of the story, see Pari. 3, Katha San. 10.
2. Just as an elephant can raise one, two, or three legs on a mountain with broken peaks, but falls to the ground when it raises all four legs, similarly, a Sadhu can purify himself with specific good determination until the fault of Atichar, but with Anachar, restraint is destroyed. The commentator says that although the elephant did not raise all four legs in the story, it was stated to prove the point in the parable (Mavri P. 68).
3. According to Jitkalpabhashya, some Acharyas consider keeping Adhakarma food in the mouth as Anachar, but the Sadhu can refrain from it. He can spit it out into a nearby vessel, but after swallowing, it is not possible to refrain, therefore, swallowing Adhakarma food should be considered Anachar (Jibha 1179, 1180).

83/3. Who is greater than a Muni who does not perform rituals according to the Yathavad-Agamoct Vidhi, because he creates doubt in others and promotes the tradition of Mithyatva? Could he be a Mithyadristi?
He is.

83/4. A Muni who consumes Adhakarma Ahar promotes its consumption and increases his own and others' attachment. He, being a Bhinnadanshtra - a Muni with an extreme craving for taste, becomes completely heartless and does not even spare living beings.

83/5. A Muni who consumes a lot of oily food becomes ill. An ill Muni loses his Sutra and Artha. There is a violation of the Shatkay in the treatment of the disease. The Praticharakas also lose their Sutra and Artha. Due to lack of care, the ill Muni himself experiences Klesh. (In the absence of proper care) he becomes angry with the Praticharakas, and in this situation, he also creates Klesh in the minds of the Praticharakas.

84. How is Adhakarma Akalpya? How is other food touched by it Akalpya? How is food placed in a vessel used for Adhakarma Akalpya? What is the method of its avoidance? How is a devotee who has consumed Adhakarma free from Dosha? The Guru explains about these topics.

84/1. (Adhakarma Ahar, other substances touched by it, food placed in a vessel not washed with Kalpatraya) - all this is Abhojya. In the case of A-Vidhi-Parihar, one should inquire about the Dosha of going to the place, etc., and in the case of Vidhi-Parihar, one should inquire about the Dravya, Kula, Desh, and Bhava. (There is no Chhalna in a Muni who acts in this way.) If there is Chhalna, there are two examples in this regard.

85. Just as vomited food from well-cooked food becomes Abhojya, similarly, vomited Adhakarma food due to Asanyam becomes Aneshanya and Abhojya for a Muni.

1
86. If a cat eats meat, can the meat, vomited by a dog and seasoned with spices, be considered edible for those who desire meat (husband and elder brother), even if it is made of a different color? (Never).

86/1. Some Acharyas describe this story as follows: A traveler had diarrhea and excreted pieces of muscle from his stool. A woman washed it, seasoned it with spices, and served it (to her husband and elder brother). The son held their hands and stopped them from eating it.

86/2. Just as the Vedas and other religious texts consider the milk of sheep and camels, garlic, onions, liquor, and beef to be Asammat - Akhadya, similarly, in the Jinashastra, Adhakarma food is Abhojya and Apeya.

1. If a Sadhu consumes Adhakarma Ahar once. 2. For the expansion of the story, see Pari. 3, Katha No. 11. Then, due to the greed for the delicious taste, he becomes inclined to consume it repeatedly (Mavru P. 69). 3. For the expansion of the story, see Pari. 3, Katha No. 11, footnote.

87. An offering, consisting of grains like sesame seeds, adorned with fruits like coconut, is considered inedible if it is touched even by a speck of impurity. (Similarly, even pure food becomes inedible if it comes into contact with the elements of an Adhakarma.) 88. If food contaminated with Adhakarma is removed from a vessel, but the vessel itself is not purified by the three Kalpas, then even pure food placed in that vessel becomes inedible. Alternatively, if a speck of Adhakarma food falls into a vessel containing pure food, then that food becomes inedible. 89. Adhakarma food is like vomit and excrement. Even a learned person is terrified upon hearing about it and avoids it. Avoidance can be of two types: with proper procedure and without proper procedure. 89/1-3. Seeing Shaliodana in a woman's hand, an uninformed ascetic asked her, "Where did this Shaliodana come from?" The woman replied, "The merchant knows, so ask him." Going to the market, he asked the merchant about the Shaliodana. The merchant said, "The rice came from Gobargram, a village on the outskirts of Magadh." He started to go there. Fearing Adhakarma, he left the main path and walked on a path full of thorns, snakes, and wild animals. Going astray, he became disoriented. Fearing Adhakarma, he even avoided the shade of trees. Overwhelmed by the heat, he fainted and suffered distress. (This is an example of avoidance without proper procedure.) 89/4. One who avoids Adhakarma in this way without proper procedure cannot attain the benefits of knowledge, etc. There are four components of proper avoidance: substance, family, country, and feeling. 89/5, 6. Rice, porridge, roasted barley flour, black gram, etc., are substances. A family can be small or large. Saurashtra, etc., are countries. Respect or disrespect is the feeling. Giving it oneself is a feeling of respect, while getting it from servants or others is a feeling of disrespect. The arrangement of these elements can be of two types: four-legged or three-legged. 89/7. If the desired substance is unavailable in the desired country, the family is small, the quantity obtained is large, and there is excessive respect, then there is a possibility of Adhakarma. In such a situation, one should inquire. If the desired substance is abundant in the desired country, even if there is no respect, inquiry is not necessary. (For example, Mandak is found abundantly in every household in Malavadesh. There is no fear of Adhakarma regarding that substance there.)

89/8. When the Muni asks, the simple-natured donor says, "This food, etc., is made for you." A donor who is attached to Maya says, "This is made for the house, not for you," but other members of the house, hearing this, look at each other or laugh at each other in shame. In such a situation, knowing it to be *Aadhākarma*, the Muni rejects it. When asked, if the donor becomes angry and says, "Muni! What is your concern, what is your worry?" In such a situation, the Muni should accept the substance without fearing *Aadhākarma*. 89/9. Those *Shravak-Shravika* who have a subtle conduct, neither show respect nor speak of goodwill when asked. Seeing the scarcity of substance, etc., the Muni does not inquire. In such a situation, if the given substance is impure, tainted by the fault of *Aadhākarma*, then how will the *Sadhu* be purified? Thus, when inquiring, the Guru says 90. Even if a *Prasūkhabhoji* Muni becomes involved in consuming *Aadhākarma* food, he becomes bound by evil karma. If, while seeking pure food, he also consumes *Aadhākarma*, he is pure because it has a pure outcome. 90/1. Hearing about the *Sangha-Bhojya*, a Muni went to that village quickly. The Seth's wife had already given away all the *Sanghabhakta*. When asked again, the Seth said, "Give the *Sadhu* some from the food made for me." The wife gave the food. While eating, the Muni thought, "This *Sanghabhakta* is delicious." (Even though it was pure food, the Muni became bound by the karma arising from the consumption of *Aadhākarma*.) 90/2-4. For the *Parana* of the monthly fast, the ascetic Muni went to a nearby village. The *Shravika* made *Kheer* for the Muni and thought, "Perhaps the *Kshapak* will come here today." So that the Muni would not have any suspicion, she put a little *Kheer* in the *Shravas* and, after cleaning it with the *Kheer* from outside, explained it to the children. With anger and disrespect, she gave the *Sadhu* *Kheer*, *Ghee*, and *Gud*, etc., as alms. Taking the alms, the *Sadhu* went to a secluded place and began to contemplate, "If some *Sadhu* comes and becomes a *Sanvibhagi*, I will be fulfilled." With a calm mind, he ate that food, even though he was unconscious. Even though he consumed *Aadhākarma* food, he attained *Kevalgyan*. 91. The king had two gardens - *Suryodaya* and *Chandrodaya*. Those who went to those gardens without permission were punished. 91/1-3. (The king announced) "In the morning, I will go to the *Suryodaya* garden with the *Antahpura*, so the *Trinaharak* and *Kasthaharak* should go to the *Chandrodaya* garden." The king thought, "I will go to the *Suryodaya* garden in the morning and come back in the evening.

The sun will be facing both sides, so I will go to the Chandrodya garden. Some wicked people, thinking they will see the king's wives (Antahpur), will sit on the branches of the letter-filled trees and hide. The gardeners will see them, so they will bind them and beat them with wood, etc. The king and the Antahpur, entering the Chandrodya garden suddenly, will be seen by the grass-eaters and wood-eaters. Their Rajapurusha will also subdue them. At midday, while going towards the city, the king will be presented with the subdued men on both sides. Those who disobeyed the order will be killed, and the others will be released. 91/4. Those who wished to see the women of the Antahpur did not have their wish fulfilled, yet they were punished by the king for breaking the royal order. The other men who saw the Antahpur were released without punishment because they did not break the royal order. In the same way, one should make a Samvattara in the matter of Adhakarma. 92. The Bodmundit person who enjoys Adhakarma and does not do the atonement for that un-doable place wanders in the world in vain, like a Lunched-Vilunched (featherless) pigeon. 93, 94. The statement of the Adhakarma door has been made. Now I will tell you about the previously mentioned Auddeshik door. It is of two types in brief - Ogh and Vibhag. Ogh is established, Vibhag has three types - Uddishta, Krit and Karma. Each has four types. Thus, there are twelve types of Vibhag. 94/1. After the famine, some householders thought - We lived somehow during the famine. Now we will give some alms every day, because surely the person who did not give alms in the past life does not enjoy in this birth, and the fruit of un-done good deeds does not happen in the afterlife (therefore, let us earn some good deeds by giving alms). 95. A housewife put rice for other Darshani Sadhus in the fixed rice to be cooked for herself. The divisionless projection Ogh Auddeshik is called for the hypocrite (other Darshani) and the householder. 1. If a person who has become a result of eating Adhakarma food takes pure food, he binds bad karma due to breaking the order, and the Muni who is engaged in the search for pure food, even if he eats Adhakarma, is a worshiper of the order, he does not bind karma (Mav P. 76). 2. The food prepared for the householder, which is kept aside for the Bhikshacharya, is called Uddishta (Mav P. 77). 3. Pimpr 31; Vanjanamisaiyikadam - Uddharit Shalyodana, which is prepared as Karamb (a dish made by mixing curd and rice) etc. for alms, is called Krit (Mav P. 77). 4. The powder of the remaining Modak in the marriage is called Karma to make Modak again from Gudpak etc. for giving to many Bhikshacharya (Mav P. 77). According to the Pindavishuddhiprakaran, it is considered Karma to be re-sanctified by heating with fire. Agni Taviyaai Pun Kammam (Pimpr 31). 5. According to the Vridh Sampradaya, the remaining food is considered to be for the Sadhu when alms are given to the intended Bhikshacharya (Mav P. 78).

95/1. The disciple asked, "How can one recognize a disguised *Ogh Auddeshik*?" The Guru said, "It can be known by paying attention to the words and actions of the householder." 95/2. (When the Muni entered for alms, the husband asked for alms, but the wife said-) "The five daily alms have already been given, or she draws lines on the wall to count the alms and counts them while giving alms. Or a woman says to someone, "Give alms from the designated donation, not from here." Or when the ascetic enters the intended house for alms, she says, "Separate this much alms." 96. The Muni who has gone for alms should not be unconscious in words, form, taste, etc. He should only be attentive to *Eshana*, just as a calf is attentive to its cow, food, and water. 96/1, 2. When there was a wedding celebration in the house, all four daughters-in-law were busy with their adornment and cosmetics. No one gave the calf food and water. In the afternoon, the Seth came home. Seeing him, the calf started to cry. Knowing that it was hungry, the Seth scolded the daughters-in-law. The daughters-in-law were like mines that provided five types of worldly pleasures. The house was also decorated more than them, but the calf did not become attached to anyone. It remained engrossed only in eating its cow, food, and water. 96/3. When the mistress of the house goes to give alms to the Muni, comes before the ascetic with alms-worthy things, opens and places the vessels, etc., the Muni, with his senses of hearing, etc., pays attention to the mistress's speech and, like a calf, remains absorbed in it, knowing *Eshana* and *Aneshana* correctly. 96/4. Knowing that there is a lot of *Shalyodana*, dishes, etc., left over in a big *Jimanwar* (Sankadi), the master of the house tells his servants, "Give all this leftover food to the alms-takers for merit." 97. There are four types of *Vibhag Auddeshik* - *Auddeshik*, *Samuddeshik*, *Aadesh*, and *Samadesh*. Each has three divisions - *Uddist*, *Krit*, and *Karma*. Multiplying three by four, *Vibhag Auddeshik* is of twelve types. 98, 99. Whatever food and water is made with the intention of the alms-takers is *Uddist*. Food made for giving to heretics (other than those who follow the right path) is called *Samuddes* or *Samuddeshik*. Food made for giving to *Shramanas* is called *Aadesh*, and food intended for giving to *Nirgranthas* is called *Samadesh*. Each of these...
1. Hearing all these conversations or seeing the lines drawn on the wall, even a disguised ascetic can know that this is *Ogh Auddeshik* alms (Mavri P. 78). 2. For the expansion of the story, see Pari. 3, Katha No. 16.

## 144. Pindaniyukti

There are two types of Pindaniyukti: Chhinna (regular) and Achhinna (irregular). Both of these have four sub-types: Dravya, Kshetra, Kala and Bhava. (Multiplying Chhinna and Achhinna with these four sub-types results in eight types.) Similarly, Nishpadit-Nishpanna should be understood as Krit and Karma, depending on where it occurs. 99/1. If food, etc., is left over in a Jemanwar, giving it away on the same day or another day, either outside or inside the house, is Kshetra Achhinna. Giving away the entire amount is Dravya Achhinna. Giving it away for the whole day or continuously is Kala Achhinna. (Bhava Achhinna is giving it away regardless of whether it is palatable or not.) 99/2. Giving away only two items of food, but not the rest, is Dravya Chhinna. Giving away one of the two, either from inside or outside the house, is Kshetra Chhinna. Giving away something from a particular time to a particular time is Kala Chhinna. (Bhava Chhinna is giving away as much as you want, but not more.) 100. If an item is Chhinna in terms of Dravya, Kshetra, etc., but the householder says before the stipulated time that it should not be given to anyone, then that item is Kalpaneya because the householder has made it his own. Sadhus avoid Achhinnakrit items. 101. If there is a Sankalpa (intention) like "this item should be given to this person, but not to that person," then sometimes it is Kalpaneya and sometimes it is not. (If there is a specific instruction for the Yatis, then it is definitely not Kalpaneya.) 101/1. (The item is not yet Auddeshik (intended for a specific purpose), it is Uddishyaman (being intended). The householder says, "This item should be given, but not the rest.") A Muni who hears about such a Sandishyaman (doubtful) item, it is Kalpaneya for him to take that item at that time. For those who do not hear, it is not Kalpaneya due to the fault of not being established. That Muni, leaving from there, tells the Munis who have not heard about the previous Purushaachirna Maryada (tradition) or through Sankalika (a group of monks), one monk tells another, and another tells the third, and in this way, all the Munis are informed that "the alms of this house are Aneshanya (not to be taken). This is the Maryada if you don't hear." 101/2. (While giving alms to a Sadhu, a woman says) "Don't give this, but give the item in this vessel." Upon hearing this, the Muni asks, "Why is this prohibited? Why is that item being given?" Then the householder woman says, "This item is kept for donation, not this." Hearing this, the Muni should avoid that item. If she says again, "What has been given has been given, now don't give the rest," then upon such prohibition, the Atmarthikrit Uddishta-Auddeshik (intended for oneself and for a specific purpose) food is Kalpaneya for the Sadhu.

1. If the householder intends that this item should be given to a Grihastha (householder), Agrihastha (non-householder), Bhikṣācara (beggar) or any Sadhu, then it is not Kalpaneya. If there is no instruction for the Sadhu in it, then it is Kalpaneya (Mavri P. 81). 2. The commentator has given two meanings of the word Sankalika: 1. To tell the Sadhus who have not heard about the Maryada that has been established by the previous Purushas (men). 2. To give information in a sequential manner, one monk to another, and another to the third monk (Mavri P. 81).

**102, 103.**  Making *karamb* by mixing *odana* with *dadhi* etc. is considered *krita* (done) due to reasons such as: emptying a vessel filled with *dadhi* etc., becoming foul-smelling without being mixed with *dadhi* etc., or being able to give it comfortably in one go after mixing with *dadhi* etc. Giving *dadhi* and *odana* separately will be considered *avarnavada* (heresy) by the *pasandhijan* (heretics).  Since what is *parikattalit* (collected and formed into a lump) can be given comfortably, binding the powder of *modaka* with *vikat-madya* (strong liquor), *phanit* (fermented), and *ghrita* (clarified butter) etc. into a lump is called *krita*.

**104.** Similarly, the nature of *karma auddeshik* (action with a specific purpose) is that there is diversity in heating the substances; for example, heating *gud* (jaggery) etc. and mixing it with *modaka* powder to make *modaka* again.

**105.** If a householder tells a *muni* (ascetic) who has entered for *bhiksha* (alms) that he will give a certain food item after cooking it again (making *modaka* again from *modaka* powder with *gudpak* (jaggery paste)), that food item is *akalpya* (unacceptable) for the *muni* because it is *karma auddeshik*. If he gives it before the cooking process, it is *kalpanya* (acceptable). Similarly, with respect to the *kshetra* (place), inside or outside the house, and with respect to *kala* (time), tomorrow or the day after tomorrow (if he says he will give it after cooking it again), it is *akalpya* for the *sadhu* (saint). If he gives it before that, it is *kalpanya*.

**105/1.** Taking such a substance before it is *krita* is *kalpanya*. Accepting it after it is done in that way is *akalpya*. If the substance is *atmarthi* (for oneself), it is *kalpanya* if it is kept aside for *yavadarthic* (as much as needed) *pak* (cooking) *dana* (donation). The rest is *anishta* (undesirable) and *ananujnat* (unpermitted).

**106.** Those who are *niranukampa* (lacking compassion) towards the *shatkay* (six categories of existence), have an *bahya drishti* (external vision) devoid of *jin-pravachan* (Jain teachings), and are *bahubhak* (eat a lot) are only *bod* (shaved head). Their condition is like that of a pigeon with lost and plucked feathers.

**107.** There are two types of *putikarma* (foul action): *dravya-puiti* (foulness of substance) and *bhava-puiti* (foulness of feeling). *Dravya-puiti* is the example of a *chhaganopalakshit* (one who observes the six vows) *dharmic* (righteous person). There are two types of *bhava-puiti*: *badar* (gross) and *sukshma* (subtle).

**108.** When a substance that was previously rich in qualities like *surabhigandha* (pleasant smell) etc. becomes contaminated with a substance having a foul smell, it is called *puiti*. Knowing this, one avoids it. This is *dravya-puiti*.

**108/1, 2.** People of the same age appointed a *dharmic* to plaster the *yaksha-sabha* (assembly of yakshas). A laborer became indigested from eating *mandaka* (a type of food), *valla* (a type of food), and drinking *sura* (liquor). He defecated foul-smelling excrement in the cow shed. A buffalo then defecated on top of it. The appointed *dharmic* plastered the *yaksha-mandap* (yaksha pavilion) with the dung mixed with filth. When the people of the assembly came for the *udyapanika* (celebration), they experienced the smell. In the plastering...

1. In a particular region, *vikat-madya* was used to bind the *modaka* powder again (Mavri p. 81).
2. The commentator, while explaining the verse, says that even *tuvari* (a type of food) etc. offered at night, if it becomes stale, is also heated and processed. Therefore, there is diversity in heating substances in *karma* (Mavri p. 82).

## 146. Pindaniyukti

The components of Valla, etc., and the foul smell of Sura, etc., were experienced. (Upon knowing the true situation) the paste of cow dung was removed and replaced with other cow dung. (Due to contact with impurity, the food was also made different.) This is an example of Dravya-puti. 109. Even pure food, due to the mixture of mere components of the divisions of Adhakarma, etc., and the origin defect, inherently makes the pure-non-deviant conduct of the Muni impure. This is Bhava-puti. 110. Adhakarma, Auddeshika, Misrajata, Badar-praabhratika, Puti and Adhyavapurka - all these are included under the Udgama koti, i.e., the A-vishodhi koti. 111. There are two types of Bhava-puti - Badar and Sukshma. I will speak about Sukshma later. There are two types of Badar Bhava-puti -  Upakaran-vishayaka and Bhakta-pan-vishayaka. 112. The stove, the vessel, the large ladle, the small ladle - all these, if mixed or touched by Adhakarma, make even pure food impure. Mixing pure food with Adhakarma-affected vegetables, salt, asafoetida, and keeping or cooking pure food in a plate, etc., touched by Sankraman-Adhakarma, processing food with Sphodan-Adhakarma-affected mustard, etc., and adding asafoetida, etc., as a seasoning - all this is Bhakta-pan-vishayaka Puti. 113. The stove, etc., for boiling food, and the ladle, etc., for cooked food, are beneficial, hence they are called Upakaran. The stove, the vessel, the spoon, the large ladle - all these are Upakaran. 113/1. Based on Adhakarma, there are four options for the stove and the vessel:
1. Stove Adhakarmiki, vessel also. 2. Stove Adhakarmiki, vessel not. 3. Vessel Adhakarmiki, stove not. 4. Neither vessel Adhakarmiki nor stove.
The first three options are inconceivable. Cooking on the stove, etc., and establishing it from another place is prohibited. If the same food is taken from another place, it is permitted. 113/2. The stove and the vessel mixed with Adhakarmika mud is Upakaran-puti. If, in the same way, the handle, the front part of the large ladle, or the stick - one of these two is Adhakarmika, then it is Upakaran-puti.
1. For the expansion of the story, see Pari. 3, Katha No. 17. 2. The Puti-dosha is described in detail in the Nisithabhashya. There, three types of Badar-puti are mentioned - 1. Ahar 2. Upadhi and Vasati. Two types of Ahar-puti are mentioned by option - 1. Upakaran-puti and Ahar-puti. (Nibha 806, 807) Two types of Upadhi-puti are mentioned - Vastra and Patra, and seven types each are mentioned under Mulaguna and Uttaraguna of Vasati-puti (Nibha 811). In Mulachar (428), five types of Puti are mentioned - 1. Chulli 2. Ukkhali (Ukhala) 3. Darvich-chammach 4. Bhajan 5. Gandha.

**113/3.** If the *ādhākarmic* food is removed from the vessel, the food in the vessel is considered *kalpya* (permissible). But if *ādhākarmic* food is given with pure food, it is considered *āhārapūti* (contaminated). The *darvi* (a type of utensil) is not *ādhākarmic*, but if it first stirs the *ādhākarmic* food and then makes a paste of pure food, then that pure food is also considered *āhārapūti*.

**193/4, 114.** To drink *takra* (buttermilk) etc. for oneself, mixing *ādhākarmic* vegetables, salt, asafoetida, mustard, and cumin etc. in it or adding spices is *bhaktpānapūti* (contamination by consumption). If the vessel in which *ādhākarmic* food was cooked is transferred to another vessel and pure food is taken out, cooked, or added to it without being cleaned with the three *kalpas* (purification methods), it is *bhaktpānapūti*. The vessel, *takra* etc. are also contaminated with *pūti* (contamination) due to the smoke that arises when *besan* (gram flour), asafoetida, cumin etc. are put on smokeless embers.

**115.** Pure food that is mixed with the elements of *ādhākarmic* fuel (embers), smoke, smell etc. is *sūkṣmapūti* (subtle contamination). Regarding this *sūkṣmapūti*, the disciple says - "It is good to avoid *sūkṣmapūti*, then why is it not prohibited in the scriptures?" To this, the teacher says:

**147**

**116.** Food mixed with the elements of *ādhākarmic* fuel, smoke, smell etc. is not contaminated. Those who believe in this contamination cannot be completely purified.

**116/1.** (The teacher says) The elements of fuel and fire are subtle. They spread invisibly with smoke, and smoke, vapor, and the smell of food - these touch the entire world. According to this view, the whole world would be contaminated.

**116/2.** The disciple says again - "If *sūkṣmapūti* is impossible, then how will the two types of *bādarapūti* (contamination by contact) and *sūkṣma* (subtle) be established? Therefore, it is proven that food mixed with fuel, smoke etc. is *sūkṣmapūti*."

**116/3.** The teacher says - "Disciple! *Sūkṣmapūti* occurs from these four - fuel, fire particles, smoke, and vapor. It is only a description, it cannot be avoided."

**116/4.** There are two types of actions: - achievable and unachievable. Achievable actions are achieved, unachievable ones are not. A person who tries to achieve an unachievable action suffers and cannot achieve the action either.

**1.** According to the commentator, this is an example of *bādarapūti*.

By washing the vessel with the three purifications, the *sukshmaputi* can be avoided.

**117/1.** (The disciple asks) - Perhaps even after abandoning the vessel in which the *ahadkarma* was taken and washing it, it does not become completely free from the elements of the *ahadkarma*, because the smell of the food remains. It is true that without substance, there are no qualities like smell, etc., so how can the purification of *sukshmaputi* be possible?

**117/2.** (The Acharya says) - In the world, it is also seen that a substance is not considered contaminated by the touch of an impure smell coming from a distance. Even the elements of poison, when they go far away and undergo a change, cannot kill anyone. (Similarly, the *pudgalas* of the smell related to *ahadkarma* do not corrupt the character, nor does the fault caused by the touch of *ahadkarma* arise.)

**117/3.** The food, etc., that comes into contact with the vessel, to the extent that it comes into contact with the *ahadkarma* vegetables, salt, etc., except for the elements of fuel like smoke, etc., is *puti*. It is *puti* for three applications. After the three purifications, the food cooked in that vessel becomes *kalpta*, i.e., the food cooked after three washes becomes *kalpta*.

**117/4.** Except for the four elements of fuel, the remaining food, drink, etc., are capable of becoming *puti*. Their quantity starts from the amount of skin. Even if a single skin is touched by *ahadkarma*, the entire food becomes *puti*.

**118.** On the day *ahadkarma* is performed in a house, the food on that day is *ahadkarma*. For the next three days, it is *puti*. It is not *kalpta* for a monk to eat there for those three days of *puti*. If the vessel of a *sadhu* is *puti*, then the food, etc., taken after the third purification becomes *kalpta*.

**1.** The commentator Malayagiri, while explaining this verse, says that the smell that comes from the vessel is *sukshmaputi*. This is only for the purpose of informing, it is not possible to avoid it because the *pudgalas* of smell are present throughout the world. The atoms of smell are not capable of destroying character (Mavri p. 86, 87).

**2.** While explaining that it is *puti* for three applications, the commentator Malayagiri says that *ahadkarma* food was cooked in one vessel. It was taken out into another vessel and cleaned with a finger, this is one application. Similarly, after cleaning it three times and cooking it, that food is called *puti*. The food cooked in the same vessel for the fourth time is not *puti*. Or, if pure food is cooked in the same vessel without the three purifications - three washes, then it is *puti* food. The food cooked in that vessel after three washes is pure (Mavri p. 87).

**3.** Fuel (ember), smoke, smell, and vapor.

119. For the ascetics, all the actions like food, clothing, shelter, etc. are considered *adhakarma*. All the *adhakarma* done for the ascetics that are mixed with food are considered *purti*.
119/1. If a muni suspects the possibility of *putidoṣa*, he should ask the *śrāvaka* or *śrāvikā*, "Was there any *jīmanvār* or *saṅghabhakt* in your house a few days ago?" Or, he should know from the conversation of the housewives whether there is *puti* or not. (If there was *saṅkhaḍi* or *saṅghabhakt*, *puti* remains in that house for three days, therefore, the muni should not take food there, and on the fourth day, he can take alms from there.)
120. There are three types of *miśrajāt*: *yāvadārthik*, *pāṣaṇḍimiśra*, and *sādhumiśra*. Even after being transferred a thousand times, *miśrajāt* food is not considered pure. (If someone who made *miśrajāt* food gave it to another person, and that person gave it to a third person, and so on, even if it is given to the thousandth person, that food is not considered pure.) It is permissible to take pure food in a vessel that has been used for *miśrajāt* after removing the *miśrajāt* from the vessel and washing it three times.
121. This food is not cooked for all the future alms-seekers, but for the intended alms-seekers, therefore, you should give it to the ascetics according to their wishes. Or, if there are too many alms-seekers, and the food that was cooked earlier will not be enough, then the householder tells his wife, "Add more food to this and cook it." That food is *yāvadārthik miśrajāt*.
122. While cooking food for his family, another householder says, "Cook some extra for the *pāṣaṇḍis*." A third householder says, "Cook some extra for the *nirgranthas* along with our food." (This is *pāṣaṇḍimiśra* and *sādhumiśra* food respectively.)
123. A person dies from the poison of *sahasraveḍhaka*. The person who eats the meat of that person also dies, and then the person who eats the meat of that person dies. In this chain of death, even the thousandth person who eats that meat dies.
124. Similarly, all three types of *miśrajāt* food destroy the pure character and soul of an ascetic, therefore, such *miśrajāt* food is not considered pure even after being transferred a thousand times.
125. If a muni takes *miśrajāt* food, he should remove it completely from the vessel, clean it with his fingers or with dry cow dung, then wash it three times and dry it in the sun, and then take pure food in it. (Otherwise, there is a possibility of *putidoṣa*.) Some *ācāryas* believe that there is no fault in taking food in that vessel after washing it four times without drying it.

##  Chapter 150:  Pindaniryukti (Designation of the Object)

**126.** There are two types of established faults: **Swasthan sthapit** (established in the proper place) and **Parasthan sthapit** (established in an improper place). Each of these has two sub-types: **Anantar** (immediate) and **Parampar** (successive). Substances like ghee are **Anantar sthapit**, they do not undergo any change. Milk, on the other hand, is **Parampar sthapit**.  Alms brought for a Sadhu after three houses are considered **sthapit**.

**127.**  **Chhabbag** (bamboo basket), **Warak** (small pot), and many other things are **Parasthan**. **Pithar** (a type of vessel), **Chhabbag**, etc. are **Swasthan**.  A **Chulli** (stove) and **Avchulli** (a place where the stove is not) are **Parasthan** because they are located in different regions.

**128.**  There are two sub-types of **Swasthan sthapana** and **Parasthan sthapana**: **Anantar** and **Parampar**.  An established substance that cannot be altered, and is not changed by the giver, is **Anantar sthapit** for the Sadhu.

**128/1.**  Substances like sugarcane juice and milk are **vikari** (liable to change) as they can be transformed into **khakka** (a type of sweet) and **dadhi** (curd) respectively. Substances like ghee and jaggery are **avikari** (not liable to change).  **Odan** (cooked rice) and **dadhi** also change into **karamb** (a type of food) and are therefore **vikari**.  They become **kuthit** (putrid) and **durgandhyukt** (foul-smelling) if kept for a long time, hence they are **vikari**.

**128/2, 3.**  A Sadhu requested milk from a housewife. She said, "I will give it to you later." The Sadhu received milk elsewhere. When the housewife reminded him about the milk, the Muni said, "I have already received milk, I will take it when I need it."  Fearing the debt, the housewife did not consume the milk.  She thought, "Tomorrow I will give the Muni curd made from this milk."  She kept it aside. The next day, the Muni did not take the curd, so the housewife made **navneet** (fresh butter), **mastu** (buttermilk), and **takra** (sour milk) from it. She made ghee from the **navneet**. If the housewife uses all of this for her family, making it **atmarthi** (for her own benefit), then:

1. The milk undergoes a change. Milk becomes curd, curd becomes butter, and butter becomes ghee.  The milk that was kept aside for the Sadhu and from which ghee was extracted is **Parampar sthapit**.  For explanation, see the translation and commentary of verse 128/2, 3 (Mavri p. 89).

2. Alms held in hand are considered faultless for three houses. After three houses, until another house is reached, it is not considered **sthapana**.  When another house is reached, the alms held in hand brought for the Sadhu fall under the category of **sthapana dosha** (fault of establishment) because it is then impossible to use them (Mavri p. 89).

3. Except for cooking vessels and **chulli-avchulli**, all other vessels are both **Swasthan** and **Parasthan**.  The commentator has given a **chaturbhangi** (four-fold classification) based on **Swasthan** and **Parasthan**:
    1. **Swasthan** in **Swasthan**.
    2. **Swasthan** in **Parasthan**.
    3. **Parasthan** in **Swasthan**.
    4. **Parasthan** in **Parasthan** (Mavri p. 90).

4. For example, if milk is kept aside as milk itself, without being processed into curd, etc., on the same day, then it is **Anantar sthapit**.  Similarly, if sugarcane juice is kept aside and given on the same day, it is **Anantar sthapit**.  If it is used to make jaggery, etc., then it becomes **Parampar sthapit** (Mavri p. 90).

151. Accepting it is *kalpata*. Established ghee, until the *deshonpurvakoti* (eight years prior to the end of life), can be tainted with *sthapana dosha*. Similarly, a substance transformed into *karamb* form, as long as it remains in an indestructible form, is tainted with *sthapana dosha*. 129. Establishing *kankab*, *pind*, *gud*, *matsyadika* (a type of sugar), *khand*, and *sharkara* from sugarcane juice is *parampar sthapana*. Similarly, *parampar sthapana* occurs when other substances are transformed. (Whatever is established, half of which is not used for *adhakarma* and which has been *atmarthikrit* (used for self-benefit), is *kalpata*.) 130. One mendicant uses one house, another uses two houses, until the use of three houses, there is no *sthapana dosha*. Beyond three houses, alms collected separately for the monk is *praabhratika sthapana*. 131. There are two types of *praabhratika* - *badar* and *sukshma*. Both have two sub-types - *avashvashkan* and *utshvashkan*. Knowing the coming and going of the community of monks, marrying a girl is *avashvashkan*, doing it earlier or later is *utshvashkan* *badar praabhratika sthapana*. 132, 133. When a son asks for food, the mother says, "Son! Don't ask again and again. The monks will come here soon, taking alms from houses in turn, and I will be ready to give them alms, then I will give you food." Hearing this, the monk rejects the alms of that house, or hearing the mother's words, the child takes the monk's finger and brings him to his house. The monk asks, "Why are you pulling my finger?" Upon asking, the child tells the truth. Hearing the child's words, the monk does not go there for alms because there is *utserpan* form of *sukshma praabhratika dosha*. 134. After the community of monks has left, knowing the day of the son's marriage, a lay devotee, knowing the day of the *jimanwar* (a festival), marries his son before the appointed time, intending to give the *modak* (sweetmeat) and *drav-tanduldhavan* (rice and water) to the monk, this is *avashvashkan* form of *badar praabhratika*. 135. Due to the non-arrival of the community of monks on the fixed day of marriage, postponing the marriage 

1. The *sthapana dosha* has the highest *kalaman* (time limit) of *deshonpurvakoti* because the *kalaman* of *charitra* (conduct) is eight years less than *purvakoti*. Explaining this, the commentator Malayagiri says that a boy became a monk at the age of eight. His lifespan was *purvakoti* (the time limit of a human lifespan). He requested ghee from a householder whose lifespan was also *purvakoti*. She said, "I will give you ghee after some time." The monk received ghee elsewhere. The householder said to the monk, "There is no need now, I will take it when needed." The householder established that ghee for the monk and kept it until the monk passed away. After the monk's death, that ghee became free from *sthapana dosha* (Mavri P. 91).

The form of *praabhratika* is *utsarpana* (offering) and *avadhushkana* (withholding). A righteous person reveals this form of *praabhratika*, while a deceitful person keeps it hidden. 135/1. There are two reasons for *avadhushkana* on days like weddings - for the purpose of auspiciousness and for the purpose of merit. Similarly, *utsarpana* also occurs for two reasons. If a householder tells the truth when asked about the reason, then a monk avoids the food offered at that wedding, etc. 136. A monk who consumes *praabhratika* offered by a devotee and does not perform *pratikramana* for that (fault) is like a pigeon with clipped wings, wandering aimlessly. 136/1-6. A *shravaka* woman saw a monk with a clipped head. His body was thin from austerity and stained with dirt. He was walking quickly and steadily, looking at the ground with a single glance. Seeing that monk coming to her house for alms, the *shravaka* woman was moved. She brought a large amount of food and drink. Thinking that the door of this house is low, so the *eshana* will not be pure, the monk moved on.

Seeing the monk leave without taking alms, the *shravika* woman became sad and ashamed and sat there with the food and drink. Just then, another monk, who was lax in following the rules of conduct, came there and accepted the alms. Then the *shravaka* woman asked, "Bhagavan! A monk came here earlier. He refused to take alms, and you have accepted them. What is the reason for this?" The monk explained the reason for refusing alms, stating the worldly and otherworldly benefits: "Monks who are in harmony with the *eshana* committee do not accept alms from houses with low doors because (due to darkness) the purity of *eshana* cannot be achieved there." (Those monks were in harmony with *eshana*, so they left without accepting alms.) You ask me how I find that food acceptable. Listen: "I am only a *lingopajivi*, only a *sadhu* in appearance, not a virtuous *sadhu*." The monk explained to the *shravika* woman about the qualities of a monk and *eshana*. Impressed by the simplicity of the *sadhu*, the *shravaka* woman offered the monk abundant food and drink with devotion. After that monk left, another monk came. When the *shravaka* woman asked him, he said, "Such monks are deceitful, they behave deceitfully. We too had previously behaved deceitfully in our vows." 137, 138. There are two types of *praadushkarana* - *prakatkarana* and *prakashkarana*. *Prakatkarana* means...

1. Explaining the latter part, the commentator says: A monk should not accept that food if he knows the truth revealed by a righteous person through tradition. Even if the *sadhu* does not know after searching, there is no fault in accepting it because the *sadhu's* results are pure (Mavri P. 93).
2. The commentator, explaining the worldly and otherworldly, has said that obtaining alms is a worldly benefit, but following dharma and rules is an otherworldly benefit, which is of greater virtue (Mat P. 94).

It is not permissible to give alms to monks by providing them with light in a place that was previously dark, by making a hole in a wall or by breaking down a wall, by lighting a gem lamp or a fire. The food that is taken for oneself is permissible. If a monk has inadvertently taken impure food due to a fault of contamination, and has not consumed it, then it is permissible to purify that food and take pure food in the same vessel without washing it. 138/1. There are three types of hearths: 1. *Sंचारिम* 2. A hearth that is built outside for the monk beforehand 3. A hearth that is built outside for the monk at that time. In all three cases, there are two faults in taking food cooked on these hearths: *उपकरणपूति* and contamination. 138/2. The housewife says, "O monk! You do not take alms from a dark place, therefore I have cooked food on an external hearth." Hearing this, the monk should avoid that food. If there is doubt, and upon questioning, the housewife speaks the truth, then the monk should avoid that food as before. 138/3. If a housewife builds a hearth outside for the monks and then thinks, "There are many flies inside the house, and it is also hot. There is air and light outside, and the cooking place is also close to the dining place, so now I will eat my food here every day." If she takes it for herself, then the food cooked there is permissible for the monk. This is the explanation of what is permissible and impermissible regarding contamination. 138/4,5. Making a hole in the wall for light, making a small door bigger, making another door, removing the upper covering or roof, installing a luminous gem, lighting a fire, lighting a lamp - if the housewife says that this has been done for the monk, or even without asking, she tells him that it has been done for him, then such food is contaminated and therefore impermissible for the monk. If the housewife does all these things for herself, then the food there is permissible for the monk, but light and lamp - both these means are impermissible because they involve contact with the *तेजस्काय*. 138/6. If a monk inadvertently or unknowingly takes food after it has been illuminated or made bright, then after knowing, he can purify that food and take another pure food in the same vessel without washing it. 139. There are two types of *क्रीतकृत*: *द्रव्यक्रीत* and *भावक्रीत*. Both have two types each: *आत्मक्रीत* and *परक्रीत*. *परद्रव्यक्रीत* is of three types: *सचित्त*, *मिश्र* and *अचित्त*.
1. *मवृ प. ९४*; *संचारिमा* or *गृहाभ्यन्तरवर्तिन्यपि बहिरानेतुं शक्यते* - a hearth inside the house that can be taken outside for some reason.

140. Atmakrita is of two types - dravya and bhava. Dravya is through things like churna, etc. Bhava is when a sadhu earns something through the display of their knowledge for another sadhu, or when they earn something through their own dharmakatha, etc., for their own sustenance. This is called parabhavakrita and atmabhavakrita respectively.

141. Earning sustenance through things like nirmalya, gandhadravya, gutika, varnka-chandanadi, pott-laghu vastrakhand, etc., is called atmadravyakrita. These can lead to two doshas - glanata, the ineffectiveness of preaching, flattery from people when one is healthy, and adhikarana.

142. If a mankh goes to a small Gokul, etc., and shows off his pat to attract people, and then brings ghee, milk, etc., for a muni and invites them, this is parabhavakrita aahar. It has three doshas - krita, abhyahit, and sthapit.

142/1. In a village, a mankh was a shayyatar. He invited sadhus for aahar. The sadhus refused. After a long time during varshavas, he asked the munis, "After chaturmas, in which direction will you go?" The munis said, "In such and such direction." Then the mankh introduced them to many houses in that direction.

142/2. Those people wanted to give the mankh milk, ghee, etc. He refused them, saying, "Not now, I will take it when I need it." The munis arrived. The mankh had already gone to those houses and collected ghee, etc., and gathered it in one house. (When the munis arrived, he gave them the donation.)

143. A muni who uses dharmakatha, debate, tapasya, the story of nimitta, aathapana, etc., to impress people, and who presents themselves as a shrutasthan-acharya, or who uses their jati, kul, gan, karma, shilp, etc., to earn aahar, etc., is engaging in atmabhavakrita.

1. Mavri P. 96; Nirmalya - the leftover food of a deva, which has the power to influence things like tirtha, etc.

2. Mavri P. 96; Gutika - a pill that is kept in the mouth for the purpose of changing its form, etc.

3. According to the tikaakar, all these things are atmadravyakrita due to the treatment of the cause in the action (Mavri P. 96).

4. If someone becomes ill after being given nirmalya, etc., then the preaching is ineffective. If someone becomes healthy after being given nirmalya, etc., then it leads to flattery. Everyone praises them. Hearing the praise, others also come and ask for nirmalya, gandha, etc. If they don't get it, sometimes it leads to conflict (Mavri P. 96).

5. M. P. 96; Mankh - a person who shows off their pat, etc., to amaze people.

6. For the expansion of the story, see Pari. 3, Katha San. 18.

7. The munis accepted it with eshana, therefore it is pure aahar. If they had known about the mankh's efforts and accepted the aahar, then the munis would have been guilty of three doshas - krita, abhyahrit, and sthapit (Mavri P. 96).

143/1. Whatever is accepted from individuals influenced by religious discourses or those who have heard religious discourses is called *ātmabhāvākṛta*. A lay follower asks, "Are you the famous religious speaker?" The monk says, "Often, the virtuous are religious speakers," or the monk remains silent. This is *ātmabhāvākṛta*. 143/2. (A lay follower asks-) "Are you the one who is a famous religious speaker in the world?" (The monk says-) "Are you talking about someone with a body covered in ashes? Or about someone who practices *daksausaukarīka-sāṃkhya*? Or about a certain householder or someone who slaughters goats? Or are you talking about a *muṇḍa kauṭumbika*, that is, a Buddhist monk, when you say religious speaker?" 2 143/3. Similarly, one should know about the *vādī*, *tapasvī*, *naimittika*, *ātāpaka*, etc. When asked about *śruta-sthāna*, that is, being an *ācārya* or a *vācanācārya*, etc., presenting oneself in that form for food, etc., is *ātmabhāvākṛta*. 144. Briefly, there are two types of *prāmitya*: worldly and transcendental. Worldly is the property acquired by a sister, etc. Transcendental is clothing, etc. 144/1. Through the practice of *śruta-jñāna*, a monk, knowing the rules of restraint, came outside a village and asked, "Is anyone from such and such family alive?" In response, it was said, "Only a daughter of that family is alive, she is your sister." The monk went to her house. When food was being cooked for the monk, the monk prohibited that food. One day, she borrowed two *pala* of oil from an oil merchant at double the interest and gave it to the monk. (The monk took the oil without knowing the full details.) 144/2. Since the debt of the oil was unlimited, he accepted servitude. After some time, the same brother came to the same village and asked about his sister. The sister told him about the monk's servitude. The monk said, "Don't cry. I will soon free you from servitude." 144/3. The monk went to the house of the same merchant for alms. The housewife washed her hands to give alms. The monk said, "The water ceremony has begun, I do not feel it is appropriate for me to accept such alms." When asked the reason, the monk explained the matter of killing living beings. The householder asked, "Bhanta! Where are you staying?" The monk said, "I haven't found a place yet." Then the householder gave him a place in his own house. By listening to the monk's discourse and the example of (Vasudeva) every day, he became detached. The merchant, with the consent of his eldest son and virtuous sister, gave him permission to renounce the world. 
1. By the monk's silence, the lay follower understands that he is the famous religious speaker, because due to his seriousness, he does not reveal himself, and being influenced by him, the lay follower gives him abundant food, etc. (Mavṛ P. 97). 2. Concluding the verse, the commentator says that after hearing so many options from the monk, the lay follower thinks that he himself is the famous religious speaker, that's why he is taking the names of others (Mavṛ P. 98).

Discarded. Such are the meanings of the songs of the Muni, and the results of the renunciation are manifested in only a few individuals. 144/4, 145. There are faults in worldly **prāmittya** related to clothes, utensils, etc., such as slavery and chain-binding. The faults related to **lokoत्तर prāmittya** are these: (A Muni was given clothes borrowed from someone, and the Muni used them.) When those clothes become soiled, torn, worn out, stolen by thieves, or fall on the road, there may be conflict. Even if a more beautiful garment is offered again in place of a previously requested garment, a donor may have a difficult interest, and then there is a possibility of conflict and other faults. 146. A Muni is in dire need of clothes. If another Muni wants to give him clothes, he should give them with a high spirit, without any apprehension, not lend them. If a Muni is crooked or lazy, and you have to give him clothes, don't give them to him yourself. Keep the clothes with the Guru. The Guru himself should give him those clothes, so that there is no conflict. 147. In brief, there are two types of **parivartita** faults: worldly and **lokoत्तर**. Both of these are of two types: **tad-dravya-viṣaya** and **anya-dravya-viṣaya**. 148. Two neighbors were related to each other. They made a **paudgalika śalyodana** change for the sake of the Sadhu. When there was conflict, everyone attained enlightenment from the Muni's teachings. 148/1. The Muni, moved by compassion for his sister, who was overwhelmed by poverty, stayed at her house. The sister made a change in the food from her neighbor's wife. Seeing **kodrava** instead of **śalyodana**, the brother asked the reason. Out of envy, the wife did not tell the reason. The husband tormented her. 148/2. On the other hand, the other one also tormented his wife. At night, the Sadhu pacified both of them. After attaining enlightenment, they were initiated, so one should not take **parivartita** food, because there are many people who pacify conflict.
1. For the expansion of the story, see Pari. 3, Katha No. 19. 2. **Tad-dravya-viṣaya** change, such as giving fragrant ghee for the Sadhu after giving foul-smelling ghee. **Anya-dravya-viṣaya** change, such as giving **kodrava** food and taking **śalyodana**, etc., this is a worldly **parivartita** fault (Mavṛ P. 100).
The meaning of the word '**sajjhilga**' in the text has been given as brother by the commentator, but here it should mean neighbor. According to the relationship, both are brother-in-law, so the meaning of neighbor seems appropriate here. Both meanings are given in the Deshi Shabdkosh (Mavṛ P. 100). 4. Daśajicū P. 236; Puvvadeśayaṇam Puggalī Odano Bhaṇṇai - People from the eastern country called rice **pudgal**. 5. For the expansion of the story, see Pari. 3, Katha No. 20.

**149.** (The exchange of clothes and other belongings between ascetics is an extraordinary exchange, and it has these faults-) Knowing that the clothes are inferior, superior, worn out, rough to the touch, heavy due to thick yarn, torn, stained, incapable of protecting from cold, or of a deformed color, the ascetic may become disturbed or his mind may be corrupted by the words of another ascetic. 

**150.** One monk has clothes that are in accordance with the rules, while another does not. In such a situation, the clothes that are in accordance with the rules should be placed at the feet of the Guru. The Guru should give those clothes to the requesting monk. If the Guru keeps them, it may lead to conflict.

**151.** There are two types of *abhyahrit* - *achirna* and *anachirna*. There are two types of *anachirna* - *nishith abhyahrit* and *no-nishith abhyahrit*. *Nishith abhyahrit* is to be established, and we will discuss it later. Now, I will discuss *no-nishith abhyahrit*.

**152.** *No-nishith abhyahrit* is of two types - *swagramavishayak* and *pargramavishayak*. *Pargramavishayak abhyahrit* is of two types - *swadesh pargrama abhyahrit* and *pardesh pargrama abhyahrit*. Both of these have two types each - *jalpath se abhyahrit* and *sthalpath se abhyahrit*. *Jalpath se abhyahrit* is of two types - *nauka se* and *dongi se*. *Sthalpath se abhyahrit* is of two types - *jangha* and *gadi adi se*.

**153.** The means of *abhyahrit* by water route are *jangha*, *bahu*, or *nauka adi*, and the means of *abhyahrit* by land route are *kandha*, *shakat*, or a cart with a donkey, bull, or other hoofed animal. These involve restraint-violation and self-violation. Restraint-violation involves violation of *kay-apkay* etc.

**154.** Self-violation by water route occurs in this way - one may be submerged due to deep water, may be caught by aquatic creatures, or one's feet may get stuck in mud, crocodiles, turtles, etc. The faults of the land route are thorns, snakes, thieves, dogs, etc.

**155.** *Swagramavishayak abhyahrit* is also of two types - *grihantar* and *nogrihantar*. *Grihantar* is called that which is brought from within three houses.

**156.** *Nogrihantar* has many types - *vatak vishayak*, *sahi-gali vishayak*, *niveshan*, and *grihavishayak*. In these, if a householder brings food, etc., to the ascetic in the *upashray* from a *kapoti*, shoulder, or earthen or bronze vessel, it is *anachirna*.

**1. ** The village where the ascetic resides is *swagrama*, and the rest is *pargrama*.

**2.** *Grihantar abhyahrit* is conceivable, and *nogrihantar abhyahrit* is inconceivable.

**3.** *Mavri P. 103; Vatak: parichchhanna: pratinayat: sannivesh: - A separate, constant dwelling is called *vatak*.

**4.** *Mavri P. 103; Niveshanam - ek nishkraman praveshani vyadhigrihani - Two or more houses with a single entrance.

156/1. If a female lay devotee brings food from her home to the monk's residence, revealing the following reasons, it is called Nonishithswagrāma Abhyāhr̥ta:
* When the monk went for alms, no one was at home.
* Or, it was not the time for alms.
* Or, food was prepared for specific individuals, so alms were not given before their arrival.
* Or, after the monk who came for alms left, sweets for a festival arrived.
* Or, when the monk came for alms, the householder was asleep.

157. The same order that was stated for Nonishith Abhyāhr̥ta related to Swagrāma-Paragrāma should be known for Nishītha Abhyāhr̥ta. Where the giver's intention is unknown, it should be known as Nishītha Abhyāhr̥ta.

157/1-4. Some monks were far away, and some were across the river. (The lay devotee had a lot of sweets left over from a wedding.) The lay devotee thought that the monks would not accept the sweets due to the possibility of Ādhākarma, so some lay devotees secretly took the sweets (to the village across the river). There, they stayed in a temple and started giving small amounts to the twice-born (Dwij) and others. They gave to the monks who had gone out for Ucchāra and other activities. At the request of those monks, the remaining monks also went there for alms. (So that the monks would not be suspicious, a lay devotee said deceitfully)- 'Do not give them everything, give them only what is necessary.' Another said- 'Give everything to the monks, we only need a little bit left.' The monks who had taken the Navakārsi with Namaskāra had already eaten. Those who had taken Purimārddha (two Paurashis) due to indigestion, etc., did not eat. After giving the alms, the lay devotees came there to pay their respects. They performed all the rituals, including Naishēdhīkī. (The monks realized that this food was brought for us.) At that time, the monks who had taken Purimārddha and had not eaten, did not eat that food. Those who had picked up the Kaval, put it back in the bowl. Those who had put the Kaval in their mouths, spat it out into the nearby Mallak-Pātra as soon as they realized. All the food in the vessels was purified. All the lay devotees apologized to the monks and returned. Those who had eaten earlier or had eaten half, are pure due to their deceitful nature.

157/5. (A householder goes to another householder's house with a Prāheṇaka to avoid the possibility of Abhyāhr̥ta. While returning, she goes to the monk's residence with the intention of giving alms to the monks and says)- 'Bhagavan! I received this Prāheṇaka while going to such and such house, or I received it on such and such day of the week.'

1. 157/1-4 In these four verses, the author has explained Paragrāma Abhyāhr̥ta Nishītha through a specific incident. For the expansion of the story, see Pari. 3, Kathā Saṅ. 21.

"I have come to the Upashraya to pay homage to the Munis. Please take this food. She gives the food to the Munis and returns." 157/6. Or, that housewife says, "O Bhagavan! I brought this food from home to give to my family, but they did not take it." (Or, some housewife, having pre-planned everything, brings food according to plan and, so that it can be heard by the Munis, says in a loud voice to the woman who is sleeping or staying near the Upashraya - ) "Take this food." Then, she becomes angry, pretending to refuse. When there is an artificial quarrel between the two, she goes to the Upashraya in anger, pays homage, and gives the food to the Munis after telling them the whole story. 158. Both types of Abhyahrit (Nishith, Nonishith or Swagram, Paragram) mentioned are Anachirna. There are two types of Achirna Abhyahrit - Desh and Deshadesh. 159. A region measuring one hundred hands is called Desh, and the middle region of one hundred hands is called Deshadesh. In this Achirna Abhyahrit, if there is a difference of three houses that are useful, then food is permissible, otherwise not. 160. Taking food brought from a distance of one hundred hands from the Pariveshanapankti (the row of those who eat in the Jimanwar, etc., with a Muni on one side and the offering on the other), a long entrance, or a Ghangeshala house is Achirna. Taking food brought from a greater distance is prohibited.
161. There are three types of Achirna Abhyahrit - Utkrishta, Madhyama, and Jghanya. Giving food taken from one hand to another is Jghanya Abhyahrit. Abhyahrit from one hundred hands is Utkrishta, and Abhyahrit from the middle place of one hundred hands is Madhyama. All three are Achirna Abhyahrit. 162. Udbhinna is of two types - Pihitoddbhinna and Kapato-dbhinna. In Pihitoddbhinna, there are two types of Pidhan - Prasook and Aprasook. Aprasook is the covering of conscious earth, etc., and Prasook is the covering of Chhagan (splinters) and Dardarak - a piece of cloth used to tie the mouth of a vessel, etc. 163. In Pihitoddbhinna, there is a violation of the Shatkay. Opening an oil vessel for a Sadhu and giving it to a son, etc., and buying and selling leads to Adikaran-paapmaya activity. The same faults are present in opening a door. There is a special violation in breaking open a machine, etc. 1. 157/5,6 - These two verses are examples of Swagram Abhyahrit Nishith. 2. Mavru P. 105; Upayogastatra Datum Shakya Ityarthah - The meaning of Upayogapurvak is - a house suitable for giving. 3. If a housewife takes rice, etc., in a bowl to serve her children, and a Sadhu comes to beg in the meantime, then changing hands is also Jghanya Abhyahrit (Mavru P. 105). 4. Kutup - a leather vessel for filling oil, etc., food given to a Sadhu after opening its mouth is Pihitoddbhinna (Mavru P. 105).

163/1. To cover the mouth of a Kutup (a type of container), a clod of earth, a stone, etc., is sometimes placed and wet earth is applied around it with awareness. The earth-bodied earth remains aware for a long time, but the water becomes unaware after some time. 163/2. The same faults that are present in opening the previously sealed (Kutup) for a Sadhu (Jain monk) are also present in resealing it after giving it as a donation, because to seal it, aware earth is again applied with water, and some people also apply heated lac on the mouth of the Kutup. 163/3. Just as the previous sealing causes harm to earth-bodied and other living beings, similarly, opening that seal for the sake of a Sadhu and resealing it also causes harm to earth and other stationary beings, and also to the ants, worms, etc., who live in the earth, and other beings with three senses. 163/4. When the mouth of a Kutup, etc., is opened for the sake of a Sadhu, the householder, the beggar, or the son, etc., gives oil, salt, ghee, and jaggery, etc. Upon opening, he definitely sells it, and others buy it. 163/5. In donation, purchase, or sale, there is a possibility of the act of taking, which leads to the sin of taking, and also, when the mouth is opened, ants, mice, etc., may fall there. 163/6. Just as opening the previously sealed pot, etc., causes harm to earth-bodied and other six-sensed beings, similarly, sealing, etc., also creates faults (Dr. Ga. 163). Similarly, the same faults should be understood in opening a closed door for the sake of a Sadhu. 163/7. Opening the door causes harm to lizards, etc. The up and down movement of the revolving door causes harm to worms, etc. When going behind the door, there is a possibility of injury to the child, etc., inside. 164. A door without a latch, which is opened and closed daily, is opened and the Muni (Jain monk) takes food. 
1. Applying heated lac also causes harm to the fire-bodied beings, because where there is fire, there is also harm to the air-bodied beings, therefore, opening the sealed container causes harm to the six-sensed beings (Mavri Pa. 106). 2. The commentator, while explaining the opening of the door, says that if there is a pot filled with water, etc., kept there, then if it breaks, the water can enter the nearby stove, which can cause harm to the fire-bodied beings. When there is harm to the fire-bodied beings, harm to the air-bodied beings is inevitable. Water entering the burrows of ants, etc., can also cause harm to the three-sensed beings. The act of donation, purchase-sale, and taking, etc., should be understood in the same way as in verse 163 (Mavri Pa. 107). 3. The commentator, while explaining the word 'Akunchiag', says that the back of the door without a latch does not rise, therefore, there is no friction and no harm to the beings. The commentator Malayagiri, while explaining the alternative reading 'Akuyiag', says that the door which does not make a creaking sound when opened is called 'Akrijikak-Krijika' (without creaking) (Mavri Pa. 107).

(This is a case of *achiर्ण ud-bhinna*.) If a vessel covered with cloth is tied, and the knot is untied and tied daily, and it is not marked with *jatu* (lac), then giving it after opening is also *chiर्ण ud-bhinna*.

**165.** There are two types of *mala-pahat*: inferior and superior. The alms given from above while standing on the front part of the feet is inferior *mala-pahat*, and the alms given from above by climbing on a *nihsarani* (platform) etc. is superior *mala-pahat*.

**166.** The example of the inferior *mala-pahat* is the *bhiksu* (monk), and the example of the superior *mala-pahat* is the *geruk* (a type of bird). The defects of inferior *mala-pahat* are like the bite of a snake, and the defects of superior *mala-pahat* are like falling from above.

**166/1,2.** Seeing the householder woman bringing *mala-pahat* alms, the *sadhu* (saint) returned from there without taking alms. At that time, a Buddhist *sadhu* came there. When asked the reason for not taking alms, the Buddhist *sadhu* said, "They have never given anything to anyone (therefore they do not get good alms). The fragrance of *modak* (sweetmeat) in a pot kept in a *mala* (garland) attracted a snake, which entered it and bit her hand. The next day, the same Jain *sadhu* came there for alms. (The householder said - ) You are cruel (because you knew and did not tell that there was a snake above). The *sadhu* told the truth, which made them attain *sambodhi* (enlightenment)."

**167.** While climbing on *asanadi* (seat), *pidhak* (stool), *manchak* (bed), *yantra* (machine for grinding *brihi* (rice) etc.), *ukhal* (mortar) etc., the *datri* (knife) can fall down. This can lead to the destruction of one's own limbs and the killing of living beings on the earth. In addition, there is a cessation of the acquisition of wealth. There is hatred towards the *muni* (ascetic). There is ineffectiveness of preaching, as people will say that this *muni* caused the death of a certain householder by taking alms from them. This ignorance spreads among people that these *muni* could not know the impending misfortune.

**168.** Similarly, there are many defects of superior *mala-pahat*. The *muni* who went for alms prohibited *mala-pahat* alms. To give alms to another *bhiksu*, a pregnant householder woman climbed on a *nihsreni* (platform). (Due to the nail of the *brihi-dalana-yantra* (rice-grinding machine) kept below) she fell down and her womb burst, and the fetus came out. The woman died at that moment. The next day, when the *muni* was asked the reason, he told the truth. The householder attained *sambodhi*.

**169.** Alternatively, there are three types of *mala-pahat*: *urdhava mala-pahat*, *adha mala-pahat*, *tiryak mala-pahat*. Giving from above by sneezing etc. is *urdhava mala-pahat*. Bringing from below, from a *bhumigruh* (underground house), *bhonhara* (cellar) etc. is *adha mala-pahat*, and giving from a very high *kumbha* (pot) etc. is *tiryak mala-pahat*.

170. If the householder is already on a platform, stairs, or a raised area before the monk arrives, and he gives alms by extending his arm into the monk's bowl, this is considered *anucchotkṣipta*. All such alms are not considered *malāpahṛta*. All other alms are considered *malāpahṛta*. 

171. If a monk, while looking at his bowl, accepts an offering from a giver with a sideways, long, or straight arm, it is considered *anucchotkṣipta*. All other ways of accepting alms are considered *ucchotkṣipta*.

172. There are three types of *ācchedya*: *Prabhuviṣayak*, *Svāmiviṣayak*, and *Stenaviṣayak*. Since *ācchedya* is prohibited by the Lord, it is not permissible for monks to accept it.

173. *Prabhuviṣayak* *ācchedya* includes offerings related to a *gopāla* (cowherd), *bhṛtaka* (servant), *dās-dāsī* (slave), *putra* (son), *putrī* (daughter), and *putra-vadhū* (daughter-in-law). These offerings have the following drawbacks: they cause displeasure, conflict, and some people develop animosity. For example, consider the case of a *gopāla*.

173/1. Monks should not accept *ācchedya* food from the master of the house, the headman of the village, or the officials of the state, such as the *kotvāl* (police chief).

173/2. On a *vāraka* day, the master took milk from the cowherd and gave it to the monk. Seeing less milk in the bowl, the wife became angry, and the children started crying.

173/3. Driven by a sense of retaliation, she went to the monk with animosity. Knowing her thoughts, the monk spoke to her, saying that he had accepted the milk at the request of her master. (Now you can take this milk back). The cowherd left the monk and said, "Don't accept *ācchedya* food again."

173/4. Nothing is obtained without earning it. Even a slave girl is not available for enjoyment without devotion. *Ācchedya* food can lead to animosity between the master and the servant, and the monk becomes the cause of the cowherd's *antarāya karma* (hindering karma).

174. If a master or the master's servants see monks and give them alms by standing in a window, extending their arms, and giving alms with difficulty after offering them a platform or something similar, this is not permissible for the monk. Giving alms from a window while standing naturally on the ground, with an extended arm, is not *malāpahṛta* and is therefore permissible for the monk (Mavṛ P 110).

1. Mat P 110; *Daīra*: A permanent platform made of wood without steps.
2. The commentator, while explaining this verse, clarifies the permissible and impermissible methods. A platform or something similar placed under the feet is not permissible. Giving alms from a window while standing naturally on the ground, with an extended arm, is not *malāpahṛta* and is therefore permissible for the monk (Mavṛ P 110).
3. The head of one's own house is called *Prabhu*.
4. The head of a village is called *Svāmi*.

**Verse 163**

It is not proper for a monk to accept food, etc., that has been taken away from family members. (This is a matter of the owner's right.)

**Verse 175**

If food, clothing, etc., are given to a monk by someone who has taken them from another, there is a possibility of conflict. Even if there is no conflict, there are two disadvantages in accepting such food:

**Verse 176**

Accepting such food leads to displeasure and obstacles. The monk incurs the sin of *adattadan*. It leads to the cessation of *bhaktapan* for one or many monks. It also leads to expulsion from the *upaashraya* and other hardships if no *upaashraya* is found.

**Verse 177**

Some thieves give food to monks or to themselves by taking it from poor people. It is not proper for monks to accept such food. Accepting *stenachchedya* food leads to the cessation of *bhaktapan* for other monks and creates animosity in the minds of those from whom it was taken. If those poor people allow the *bhaktapan* to be given, then the monk can accept it.

**Verse 177/1,2**

Some thieves are kind towards monks. If, while traveling in a caravan, thieves give *achchedya* food to monks upon seeing that their *bhaktapan* is not complete, the monks should not accept it, so that they are not expelled from the caravan and their *bhaktapan* is not stopped. As in the example of *ghritasaktu*, if the caravan members allow it, the monk can accept the *achchedya* food, but should return it to them when the thieves leave. If the caravan members give permission, the monk can accept the food.

**Verse 178**

The Tirthankaras have forbidden the acceptance of *anisrusht* and *ananujnat* food. *Nisrusht* and *anujnat* food is permissible for well-behaved monks. *Anisrusht* is of many types: related to *ladd*, food, *kolhu*, wedding feasts, milk, and *apan*, etc.

**Verse 179-180**

Thirty-two young men had made ordinary *modak*. The monk asked the appointed guard, "Where are the remaining young men?"

Page #336:

## Chapter 164: The Allocation of Food

"He has gone for a bath," someone said. The (greedy) monk replied, "You don't even earn merit from the offerings of others. Even if you gave me 32 laddoos, only one would be your share. Charity is a small expenditure and yields great rewards. If you know this, then give me all the laddoos." The monk, having received all the laddoos, started to leave. On the way, the young men asked, "What have you received today?" The monk said, "Nothing." Seeing the heavy bag, the young men said, "We will see the bag." They forcibly looked into the bag. Out of fear, the appointed protector said, "I did not give him any laddoos." The young men said, "You have stolen goods, therefore you are a thief." They grabbed his clothes and pulled him. They took away the monk's ascetic attire and equipment, making him a *pachakkad* (householder). When questioned in the royal court, the monk remained silent out of shame, and thus he was banished from the country. Thus, it is wrong to take from an unworthy person, but food and other things are acceptable when given by a worthy person.

181. Similarly, in the case of instruments, *sankaḍi* (wedding feast), milk, and shops, etc., the *Tīrthankaras* have forbidden the general *anisṛṣṭa* and *ananuññāta*. What is permitted by the master is permissible. 181/1. Now, the *coḷḷaka* is the door related to food. There is much to be said about it, therefore its explanation is given later. The Guru has described two types of *coḷḷaka*: 1. *Svāmī* related, 2. *Hastī* related. 182. *Coḷḷaka* is of two types: *chhinna* and *acchinna*. *Acchinna* is also of two types: 1. *Nisṛṣṭa*, 2. *Anisṛṣṭa*. In *chhinna* *coḷḷaka*, the thing given by the master is permissible. 183. If the *chhinna* *coḷḷaka* (food) is given to the monk by the one for whom it was intended, whether seen or unseen by the original master, it is permissible for the monk. Similarly, *acchinna* *coḷḷaka* is also permissible. On the contrary, *chhinna* or *acchinna* that is not permitted by the master, whether seen or unseen, is not permissible for the monk.

1. One who lives a householder life after taking *dīkṣā* is called a *pachakkad*. 2. For the expansion of the story, see *Parī.* 3, *Kathā Saṅ.* 25. 3. After "laddoos" in *Dwāragāthā* 178, there is "the *coḷḷaka* door," therefore the author says that after verse 180, in verse 181, the explanation of the "coḷḷaka door" was to be given, but in it, a general statement about instruments, *sankaḍi*, etc., has been made together. The author had to explain the "coḷḷaka door" in detail, therefore it has been given later (verse 181/1) in the order. 4. Someone makes food for the *hālika* (family members) in a particular area. If he sends food for each *hālika* in separate vessels, it is called *chhinna*. When he sends food for all the *hālika* in the same vessel, it is called *acchinna*. Similarly, in the case of *udyāpanikā* (ceremony), etc., one should understand *chhinna* and *acchinna* *coḷḷaka* (M.V.P. 114). 5. If the collective *coḷḷaka* sent for the *hālika* is also sent for the monk's charity, it is called *nisṛṣṭa*, and the other is called *anisṛṣṭa* (M.V.P. 114). 6. If the one for whom the *chhinna* was intended, the giver himself wants to give that *chhinna* *coḷḷaka*, then it is permissible. In the case of *acchinna*, if all the masters permit, then it is permissible for the monk to accept that thing (M.V.P. 114).

**184.**  Food offered to an elephant by its keeper is considered permissible even if the elephant does not see it. However, food offered to an elephant by its keeper is not permissible if the elephant does not see it. If the food offered by the keeper is not seen by the elephant, it is considered permissible. 

**185.**  Accepting unpermitted royal offerings and food offered to an elephant leads to obstacles and faults like *adattadan* (giving without receiving). Seeing the food offered daily by the keeper, the elephant may break the *upaashraya* (shelter) of the *sadhu* (holy person).

**186.**  There are three types of *adhyavapurka* (supplementary food): *swagruhayavadarthikamishra* (mixed for oneself and for those who come), *swagruhasadhุมिश्र* (mixed for oneself and for the *sadhu*), and *swagruhapaashandimishra* (mixed for oneself and for the *paashandi* (heretic)).  Cooking more food for these three while preparing food for oneself before the arrival of the *sadhu* or *paashandi* is considered *adhyavapurka*.

**187.**  The quantity of rice, water, flowers, fruits, vegetables, and spices varies during the time of offering. This is the difference between *adhyavatar* (supplementary food offered at the time of offering) and *mishra* (mixed food).

**188.**  If *yadvadarthikamishra* *adhyavapurka* food is mixed with pure food, it can be purified by simply removing that portion. If *swagruhapaashandimishra* or *swagruhasadhุมिश्र* cooked food falls into pure food, the entire food becomes impure.  After removing the portion of *yadvadarthikamishra* *adhyavapurka* food, the remaining food is permissible for the *munis* (Jain monks). However, *swagruhapaashandimishra* and *swagruhasadhุมिश्र* *adhyavapurka* food is not permissible even if the remaining portion is left.

**Notes:**

1. For the explanation of this verse, see the translation and commentary of verse 185.
2. While explaining the word "adi" (etc.), the commentator says that faults like being pulled by humiliation and changing one's appearance to that of a *sadhu* are also generated.
3. While explaining this verse, the commentator says that if the king takes something without permission, he may get angry and dismiss the keeper from his job. The *sadhu* faces the loss of his livelihood due to this, so the *sadhu* is considered to have the fault of *antaraya* (obstacle).  While explaining the latter part of the verse, Malayagiri says that seeing the keeper offering food daily, the elephant may get angry thinking that this *mund* (bald-headed person) takes food from me daily. Therefore, seeing the *sadhu* in the *upaashraya*, the elephant may break the *upaashraya* and may even kill the *sadhu*. Therefore, one should not accept food offered by the keeper in front of the elephant (Mavri p. 115).
4. The word "sadhu" is not used in the original verse. The commentator Malayagiri says that "sagarmi se tti atra sadhushabdo'dhyahriyate" (the word "sadhu" should be added here). *Swagruhasramanamishra* is included in *swagruhapaashandimishra*, so it is not mentioned separately (Mavri p. 115).
5. The author has explained the difference between *mishra* and *adhyavapurka* in this verse. In *mishra*, more food is cooked for *yadvadarthik* etc. from the beginning, and in *adhyavapurka*, more rice etc. is added later (Mavri p. 115, 116).
6. *Swagruhayavadarthikamishra* *adhyavapurka* falls under the category of *vishodhi koti* (purifiable).
7. Even after separating that portion from the *swagruhapaashandimishra* and *swagruhasadhุมिश्र* or giving it to the *paashandis*, the remaining food is not permissible (Mavri p. 116).

188/1. The remaining food is permissible for the Sadhu if the cooked food is separated from the vessel or removed from it to the extent that it is necessary. If the food is given to the Karpatakas by estimation without counting the particles, etc., then the remaining food is permissible for the Sadhu. 189. There are two types of Udgamdosha with sixteen divisions - the first is Vishodhikatik and the second is Avishodhikatik. 190. Adhakarma, the last three divisions of Auddeshik - Puti, Misrajat, Badarprabhritika, the last two divisions of Adhyavapurka - Swagrihapashandimishra and Swagrihasadhุมishra - these are Avishodhikoti Udgamdosha. 191. Food that is touched by the ingredient of Avishodhikatik food, the vessel that is in contact with it or without contact, which is not purified by three Kalpas, is Putidosha-affected food. Similarly, food or a vessel that is in contact with Kajik, Avshravan, Chaulodak is also Putidosha-affected. 192. The remaining Udgamdosha are Vishodhikatik. If Vishodhikatik Udgam Bhakta-pan is mixed with pure Bhakta-pan, then it should be abandoned as much as possible. If the mixed Bhakta-pan is not noticed and is mixed with the liquid, then the entire Bhakta-pan should be abandoned. Even if some subtle ingredients of Bhakta-pan are left in the vessel after separating the food, it is permissible to take another Bhakta-pan in that Akritakalp vessel. 192/1. There are four types of Vivek-Parityaag - Dravyavivek, Kshetravivek, Kalavivek and Bhaavavivek. The abandonment of the substance is Dravyavivek. The abandonment of the place is Kshetravivek. The immediate abandonment of the Dosha-affected food after knowing it is Kalavivek. The Muni who abandons the Dosha-affected food, etc., without any deceit, attachment or aversion, is Bhaavavivek.

1. Putidosha includes Aharaputi (Pimpra T. 49). 2. The meaning of Lep - Bhakta mixed with liquid like buttermilk, milk, etc. 3. Alap - Bhakta in contact with Vall, Chana, etc. The Bhashyakar explains it by saying that just as in the worldly practice, a vessel or an object is washed even if it is placed on dry ash, similarly, the vessel needs to be purified by three Kalpas just by the touch of Alap Adhakarmik Vall, Chanak, etc. If three Kalpas are mandatory even when Alapkrid is taken, then what to say about the substance mixed with buttermilk, etc.? (Pibha 28, 29). 4. There are three Bhashya Gathaas (Pibha 28-30) in the explanation of this Gatha. While explaining the latter part of the Gatha, the Tikakar says that some Acharyas believe that the food prepared for the Sadhu is Adhakarma. The remaining Avshravan (Mand), Kanjik, etc. are not affected by Putidosha, but this belief is not correct. The intention of the Niyuktikar is that if Kanjik, Avshravan, etc. are made from the Odan prepared for the Sadhu, then it is Adhakarma because it is its ingredient, therefore, food in contact with Kanjik, Avshravan and Chaulodak, etc. is affected by Putidosha (Mavri P. 117). 5. For the explanation of Kritakalp or Kalpatraya, see the note of Gatha 117/3.

192/2.  There are four categories based on the similarity or dissimilarity of dry and moist substances, such as:
* Dry in dry.
* Dry in moist.
* Moist in dry.
* Moist in moist.

Of these, two categories (first and fourth) have equal proportions, and two categories (second and third) have unequal proportions.

192/3,4. In the first category, when dry matter falls into dry matter, it can be easily removed. In the second category, when something like a timen (a substance with a vishodikottik dosha) mixes with dry matter, then a liquid like kanji is added, the vessel is tilted, and the liquid is separated by placing a hand over the mouth of the vessel. In the third category, when impure dry matter falls into pure moist timen, etc., as much as possible is removed by hand, and then the timen, etc., is considered fit for use. In the fourth category, when moist falls into moist, or when impure moist matter mixes with pure moist matter, if the matter is rare, then the impure matter is removed and the remaining is considered fit for use.

192/5. If a muni can survive without that substance, then he should abandon all the substance. In the situation of not being able to survive, he should take recourse to the four categories mentioned above. A muni who takes recourse to these categories attains purity, and a mayaavi muni gets bound by them.

192/6. Kotikaran is of two types: udgamkoti and vishodikot. Udgamkoti has six types, and vishodikot has many types.

192/7. Kotikaran is of nine types, eighteen types, twenty-seven types, fifty-four types, ninety types, and two hundred and seventy types.

1. In the gatha, the word 'sukkol sarispaae' indicates equal proportion, and the word 'asarispaae' indicates unequal proportion (Mavri P. 118).
2. For the six types of udgamkoti, see the translation of gatha 190.
3. Self-killing, causing others to kill, and approving of killing; self-cooking, causing others to cook, and approving of cooking; self-buying, causing others to buy, and approving of buying - these nine categories, the first six are under the category of avishodi kotikaran, and the last three are under the category of vishodi kotikaran. One consumes this with attachment or aversion, therefore, multiplying 9 by two gives eighteen categories. Multiplying 9 by mithyatva, agyan, and aviriti gives 27, and multiplying raag-dvesh with these gives 54 categories. Multiplying the original 9 categories by the tenfold Shraman Dharma gives 90 categories. Multiplying 90 by knowledge, vision, and character gives 270 categories (for details, see Mavri P. 119, 120).

193. The sixteen faults of origin should be known to arise from the householder, and the faults of production should be known to arise from the ascetic. 194. There are four types of production: name, establishment, substance, and emotion. There are three types of substance-production and sixteen types of emotion-production. 194/1. The production of a son, horse, and tree-vine, etc., by means of a hairy man, horse, or seed, respectively, in an auspicious manner, is conscious substance-production. 194/2. The production of (ornaments, etc.) according to desire from sufficient metals like gold, silver, etc., is unconscious substance-production. Making a slave, maidservant, etc., one's own by giving them wages, etc., is mixed substance-production. 194/3. There are two types of emotion-production: praiseworthy emotion-production and non-praiseworthy emotion-production. The production of nursing, etc., accompanied by anger, etc., is non-praiseworthy emotion-production, and the production of knowledge, etc., is praiseworthy emotion-production.

10. Greed
195, 196. The sixteen faults of production are: 1. Nurse 2. Messenger 3. Cause 4. Livelihood 5. Forest-dweller 6. Physician 7. Anger 8. Pride 9. Illusion 10. Greed 11. Previous praise, subsequent praise 12. Knowledge 13. Mantra 14. Powder 15. Yoga 16. Root-karma 197. There are five types of nurses: 1. Milk-nurse - one who breastfeeds. 2. Bathing-nurse - one who bathes. 3. Adorning-nurse - one who adorns the child.

1. The nurse, messenger, etc., are sixteen types of emotion-production, see the translation of Ga. 195, 196. 2. If a person does not have a son by any means, then by making a vow to a deity, in an auspicious manner, in the menstrual period, by having intercourse with a hairy man, the production of a son, etc., is conscious substance-production. Similarly, by paying rent, having intercourse between another person's horse and one's own mare, producing a horse, etc., and by sowing seeds and watering them, producing trees, etc., is conscious substance-production (Ma. Pa. 120).

198. Etymology of the word Dhatri
She who carries the child, she is the Dhatri.
·
She who nourishes the child, she is the Dhatri.
• She whom the child drinks from (breastfeeds from), she is the Dhatri.
In ancient times, according to their wealth, wealthy people appointed five types of Dhatris.
198/1,2. (The Muni, having gone for alms, sees the child crying and says - ) This child is still dependent on milk, therefore he is crying because he is not getting milk. You, who desire alms, give me alms and feed him milk, or say, feed him milk and then give me alms, or I do not want alms, I will come back for alms again. Or, he who is not humiliated, he is wise, healthy and long-lived. Or say, it is rare to see the face of a son in the world. You feed him milk, otherwise I will feed him milk.

198/3. If the mistress of the house is virtuous - inclined towards Dharma - when the Sadhu says this, she will perform half-karma-born violence, etc., and if she is wicked - not inclined towards Dharma - then hatred may arise in her mind. If the child becomes ill due to karma-udaya, then the preaching is disrespected. People, thinking the Muni to be flattering, criticize him, or the householder's mind becomes suspicious of the Sadhu's character.

198/4-6. This is another option for Dhatri-karan. Upon going to the house for alms, seeing the devout woman without patience, the Sadhu asked, 'What is the reason for your sorrow?' She said, 'He who helps in sorrow is called something.' When the Muni asked, she said, 'My Dhatritva has been taken away today.' The Muni said, 'I do not know about the age, the thickness of the breasts, and the thinness of the body of the newly appointed Dhatri.' After asking all the details, the Muni went to the wealthy man's house and seeing the child, said, 'It seems this family has just risen high, that is, become prosperous, because if it were traditionally prosperous, the traditional Dhatri would also be skilled. That is, your ancestors did not have knowledge about Dhatri, that is why such and such a Dhatri has been appointed. Whatever skill the child has, it is the effect of past punya, I am informing you by seeing the child.'
198/7. The old Dhatri has weak milk, the child who drinks the milk of the one with excessively large breasts, his nose...

##  Chapter 170:  The Appointment of Attendants

**The Appointment of the Nurse**

If the nurse is flat-chested, she will have difficulty breastfeeding, and a thin nurse will have less milk. A nurse with pendulous breasts will cause the child to have a long face. 198/8. The Muni praises the new nurse for her complexion, and he praises the old nurse for her complexion. If they are of the same complexion, he praises the old nurse for her excellent complexion and calls the new nurse's complexion poor. (If the householder, after hearing this from the Muni, dismisses the new nurse and keeps the old nurse, then this statement about the nurse's fault is complete.) 198/9. When dismissed from her position, the new nurse may become resentful and falsely accuse the Sadhu of being a seducer. The old nurse may think that the new nurse could also cause trouble in her life, so she may use poison or other means against the Sadhu. The new nurse may also use poison or other means. 198/10. Similarly, one should understand the same principles regarding the other attendants, such as the bathing nurse, in relation to the child and the mother. One should understand all the aforementioned faults, such as resentment, that arise when the bathing nurse, etc., are dismissed from wealthy households. 198/11. (The Muni enters the house and says to the householder-) 'This child is rolling on the ground, so he is covered in dust. Bathe him, or I will bathe him.' The Muni, pointing out the faults of the bathing nurse, says, 'Bathing the child with too much water will make him afraid of water, weak-sighted, or bloodshot.' 198/12. The bathing nurse massages the child with oil, then wraps him in her hands, and then bathes him after applying a paste of various substances. She cleanses the child's body and hands him over to the adorning nurse. 198/13. (The Muni, returning home after begging, sees the child without ornaments and says to the householder-) 'Adorn this child with earrings, tilak, and other ornaments. If you cannot do it, I will adorn him.' (He points out the faults of the newly appointed adorning nurse, saying-) 'Look, this nurse has put ornaments meant for the hands or neck on the child's feet.' 198/14. This playing nurse has a loud voice, so the child will have a 'chunnमुख' (a mouth that is too small) or a 'क्लीबमुख' (a mouth that is too large). Or, this nurse has a soft voice, so the child will speak indistinctly. Or, she will influence the श्राविका (female lay follower) 
1. मवृ प. १२४; इषुकाकारमाभरणम् अन्ये तिलकमित्याहुः- An ornament shaped like an arrow, some Acharyas call it a tilak.

He plays with the child himself or makes him play by conversing with him, etc. 198/15. A child becomes विकटपाद (with a wide gap between his feet) due to a स्थूल क्रीड़नधात्री (a nurse with a thick body). A child experiences discomfort in the lap of a भग्न कटि (broken waist) or शुष्क कटि (dry waist) nurse. A child becomes timid if he stays with a nurse who has मांसरहित (fleshless) and कर्कश (rough) hands. 199. In the city of Kollar, the Sangam Sthavira was residing. His disciple Datta was wandering from village to village. The Acharya gave the disciple a धात्री पिंड (a piece of food for the nurse). By divine grace, the Acharya's finger became inflamed. 200, 201. There are two types of दूती (messenger): स्वग्राम (from the same village) and परग्राम (from another village). Each has two types: प्रकट (manifest) and छन्न (hidden). The one who clearly says, "She is your mother," "He is your father," is a प्रकट दूती, and the one who conveys the message in a hidden way is a छन्न दूती. There are two types of छन्न दूती: लोकोत्तर (supernatural) and the other is उभयपक्ष (both worldly and supernatural). 201/1. While going for alms, etc., the Muni carries the message of the mother, etc., saying, "Your mother said this," "Your father said this." (This is प्रकट दूतीत्व.) 201/2. Thinking that दूतीत्व is blameworthy, he says in another way to another Muni for his understanding, "Your daughter is अकोविद (unaware), unfamiliar with tradition, she told me to give this message to your mother." (This is प्रच्छन्न दूतीत्व.) 201/3. To tell the mother or father, "Your desired work has been accomplished in the same way," or "I will do as you wish," is उभयपक्ष (both worldly and supernatural) प्रच्छन्न दूतीत्व. 202, 203. There was enmity between two villages. The Muni stayed in a village where the शय्यातरी (wife of the headman) was his daughter. (She sent her daughter with the Muni to convey the message of the arrival of the धाटी-दस्युदल (band of robbers).) When it became known, the husband, son, and son-in-law of the शय्यातरी were killed while fighting with the band of robbers. People spread the rumor, "Who gave the information to the धाटी?" The daughter said, "My father, who killed my husband, son, and father-in-law, gave this information." 204. निमित्त (cause) is related to the three times, and in its six types, the statement of the cause related to the present time is immediately harmful. This is an example of that. 205. The नैमित्तिक (one who knows the cause) compassionately informed the गृहस्वामिनी (housewife) about the arrival of her husband who had been away for a long time.
1. The commentator has elaborated on this story in two verses (Pibha 31, 32). For the elaboration of the story, see Pari. 3, story no. 26. 2. For the elaboration of the story, see Pari. 3, story no. 27. 3. The six types of निमित्त are: 1. लाभ (benefit), 2. अलाभ (loss), 3. सुख (happiness), 4. दुःख (suffering), 5. जीवन (life), and 6. मरण (death).

(The wife said to her husband, who was asking the reason) - "The Naimittika had already told you about your arrival." The husband, angered, asked the Naimittika - "What is in this mare's belly?"

## 206. There are five types of Ajiivana - Jaati, Kul, Gan, Karma and Shilp. Each has two types - Sucha, meaning to say with specific words, or Asucha, meaning to say with clear words.

## 207. There is a specific description regarding Jaati and Kul. The group of Mall etc. is called Gan, and agriculture etc. is called Karma. Shilp is weaving, sewing etc. Karma that produces displeasure and Shilp that produces pleasure is called so.

## 207/1. Seeing a Brahmin son performing Homa etc. rituals correctly, the Muni knows that this is a Brahmin son, or that he has stayed in a Gurukul, or (the Muni tells his father that your son) indicates the qualities of an Acharya.

## 207/2. (The Muni says to the Brahmin father to reveal his Jaati) - Your son has performed Homa etc. rituals correctly or incorrectly. There are three forms of incorrect action - less, more and opposite. These are the components of correct action - Samidha - wood for the Yajna, Mantra, Ahuti, Sthan, Yag - Yajna, Kaal, Ghosh etc. (Hearing this, the Brahmin knows that the Muni is also of the Brahmin Jaati, this is Upjeevana from Jaati.)

## 207/3. Like Jaati, one should know about the Upjeevana of Ugrakul etc. In Gan, there is knowledge of Mandal - entry etc. In entering the war, there is Devkul Darshan, for the call of the Prati-Mall, the same language is used, for the expansion of the story, see Pari. 3, Katha San. 28, there are two verses of the Bhashya in the explanation of this story (Pibha 33, 34). 2. Mavri P. 129; Matuh Samuttha Jaati - Jaati born from the mother's side is called so.

## 1.
## 3. Mavri P. 129; Pitrusamuttham Kul - Kul born from the father's side is called so.

## 4, 5. Agriculture etc. is called Karma, and weaving, sewing etc. is called Shilp, or Karma that produces displeasure, aversion, and Shilp that produces pleasure, i.e. attracts the mind, is called so. The commentator Malayagiri, presenting an alternative view, said that Karma taught by an Anaacharya and Shilp taught by an Acharya is called so (Mavri P. 129, Nibha 4412, Chu P. 412).

## The commentator, explaining this verse, says that through these indications, the Muni reveals his Jaati, that he is a Brahmin (Mavri P. 129).

## Seeing the Muni's son, who has entered the Ugrakul, appointed to the duty of a guard, he says that it seems your son is skilled in the deployment of the infantry. Hearing this, the father knows that this Sadhu is born in the Ugra Kul. This is the revelation of one's own Kul through Sucha. When he reveals his Kul in clear words, that I am of the Ugra or Bhog Kul, then this is the revelation of Kul through Asucha (Mavri P. 129).

## 6. Mavri P. 129; Ihakarvalake Pravishtaasyekasya Mallasyallbhyam Bhukhandam Tanmandalam - Mandal - the land that is available for one Mall is called Mandal.

To praise the son of a householder or to know that he is a wrestler, by observing his actions like wrestling and punishment, is a livelihood based on the group.
207/4. To know or to clearly state, by one's own skill, that a person engaged in a profession or craft is right or wrong, by observing the many things gathered for the purpose of the doer of that profession or craft, is a livelihood of profession and craft.

208. There are five types of *Vanipak* - *Shraman*, *Mahan*, *Kripana*, *Atithi* and *Shwan*. This word is derived from the root "Vanu Yachane". A *Vanipak* is one who begs by claiming to be a devotee of *Shraman* etc.
208/1. Just as a cowherd searches for another cow for a calf whose mother has died, similarly, a *Vanipak* is one who begs by showing himself as a devotee of *Shraman*, *Mahan*, *Kripana*, *Atithi* or *Shwan* in front of their devotees, out of greed for food etc.
173
209. There are five types of *Shraman* - *Nirgranth*, *Shakya*, *Tapas*, *Gairuk* and *Ajivika*. When a monk is given food, if he claims to be a devotee of *Shakya* etc. out of greed for food etc., this is his *Vanipakta*.
209/1. These *Shakya* monks eat without attachment, like a wall painting. They are extremely compassionate and generous. If what is given to these Brahmins who are extremely attached to lust and sexual intercourse is not wasted, then how can what is given to *Shakya* etc. monks be wasted?
210. Praise of *Shakya* etc. leads to the stabilization of falsehood, the propagation of faults like origin etc., which leads to the possibility of their inclusion in the *Gachchha* due to attachment to food. There is a perception among people that these saints are flattering, they have never given charity, or if the devotees of *Shakya* etc. are hostile, they say, "Don't come here again."
210/1. (The monk says to the Brahmins, praising them in the form of *Vanipakta* in front of the Brahmin devotees) - Charity given to the benevolent *Bhumidev* - Brahmins is very fruitful. Charity given to *Brahman Bandhu* - that is, all Brahmins, is also very fruitful, then what to say about the fruit of giving charity to a Brahmin engaged in six duties?
1. *Mavri P. 130*; *Dandadhika Dharnipat Chhuptaank Yuddha Prabhritaya* - To fight etc. by falling on the ground, sitting on the chest of a sleeping wrestler, is called *Dand*.
2. *Dra. Thanam 5/200*.
3. In *Manusmriti* (10/75), the six duties of Brahmins are:
*Adhyapanam Adhyayanam Yajanam Yajanam Tatha*. *Danam Pratigrahachaiva Shatkarmaanyagrajanmanah* ||
The six duties related to the livelihood of a Brahmin are as follows:
*Unchha Pratigraho Bhiksha, Vanijyam Pashupalanam*. *Krishikaram Tatha Cheti, Shatkarmaanyagrajanmanah* ||
The six duties related to yoga are as follows: 1. *Dhauti* 2. *Vasthi* 3 *Neti* 4. *Nauli* 5 *Trataka* 6. *Kapalbhati*.

210/2. This world is worshiped and worshiper. A person who gives charity without any desire to a miser, sorrowful, friendless, diseased, and lame person, takes away the flag of charity, that is, takes the flag of charity in his hand. (It is a fault to say this in front of miserly devotees, etc.) 210/3. Generally, people give charity to their benefactors, acquaintances, and dependents, but the person who gives charity to a weary traveler on the road, that is true charity. (It is a fault to say this in front of guest devotees, etc.) 210/4. Cows, bulls, etc., easily get food like grass, etc., but dogs, who are despised with disgust, do not easily get food. 210/5. These dogs are special deities of Mount Kailash. On earth, they roam in the form of Yakshas. Their worship is beneficial and non-worship is harmful. (It is a fault to say this in front of dog devotees, etc.) 211. This Muni has understood my feeling that Brahmins, etc., are worthy of salutation in the world. There are two faults in the fault of each of the above subjects, namely, Bhadraka and Prant, etc. (If a person is Bhadraka, then he rewards the Muni with half-karma by listening to words of praise, and if he is Prant, then he throws the Muni out of the house.) 212. Similarly, 'Kak', etc., are also accepted by the acceptance of the dog. Whoever is attached to (the worship of Kak, etc.), he presents himself as his devotee by praising him when asked or without being asked. 213. It is also a fault to say, "Charity given to a worthy or unworthy person is not in vain," so it is a great fault to praise unworthy charity. 214. There are three types of treatment by a Sadhu when asked by a householder:
* I am not a physician. (From this sentence, he understands that he should go to a physician.)
* He speaks of the action of pacifying his own disease.
* Or he treats himself as a physician. 214/1. When going for alms, a sick Muni asks a sick person for relief from his illness. The Muni says, "Am I a physician?" Knowing this objection, the patient understands that he should go to a physician. This is the first type of treatment. 214/2. When asked by the patient, the Muni says, "I was also suffering from this pain or disease. I was cured of the disease by such and such medicine. We Munis cure spontaneously arising diseases by the penance of oil, etc." This is the second type of treatment.

214/3. When a visitor or a disease caused by metal poisoning arises, the Muni first performs a purification of the stomach, then alleviates the bile, etc., and then removes the cause of the disease. (This is the third type of treatment.) 215. In the act of treatment, there is a continuous practice of non-restraint yogas because the householder is like a hot iron ball. (He is constantly engaged in the destruction of the six living beings throughout his life, therefore his treatment constantly causes non-restraint yogas). In this case, one should know the example of a weak tiger. If the disease becomes very severe even after treatment, the householder suppresses it, which leads to criticism of the preaching. 216. The city of Hastakalp is an example of the anger-lump, the city of Giripushpit is an example of the pride-lump, the city of Rajagriha is an example of the delusion-lump, and the city of Champanagari is an example of the greed-lump. Ghevar, Sevayi, Modak, and Kesaria Modak - these four items are the causes of the origin of anger, etc., respectively. 217. The food that is obtained through the influence of the Muni's knowledge and penance, through the favor of the royal family, or through the influence of physical strength, is the anger-lump. 218. When a Sadhu becomes angry at not receiving donations while seeing others donate or while begging himself, the householder gives donations thinking that the Muni's anger is not auspicious, that is the anger-lump. Or, the fruit of anger is to curse with death, etc., the donation given with this thought is also the anger-lump. 218/1. When the Muni did not get food in the house of a deceased devotee, he became angry and said, "Give donations next month." (In the second month and the third month also, there was a death feast in that house due to the death of someone.) For the third time, the elder gatekeeper told the householder the whole story. He apologized and gave donations to the Muni. (This is an example of the anger-lump). 219. The Muni who desires a lump due to being encouraged by others, or by becoming proud after hearing words of gain and praise, or by being insulted by others, is the pride-lump. 219/1, 2. In the festival of making Sevayi, this voice arose in the group of Sadhus, "Who will bring Sevayi this morning?" A small Muni said, "I will bring it." The Munis said, "Our purpose will not be fulfilled with Sevayi obtained in insufficient quantity without jaggery and ghee." "I will bring Sevayi as you wish," saying this, the Muni went out to beg. 219/3. When begging, the householder's wife insulted the Muni and refused to give him Sevayi.
1. For the expansion of the story, see Pari. 3, Story No. 29. 2. In Mulachar (Ga. 454), there is a difference in the names of the cities related to pride, delusion, and greed. The mention of Vennaatatt related to pride, Varanasi related to delusion, and Rashianagar related to greed is there. In Mulachar, there is no mention of the names of food items. 3.

The Muni said to the householder's wife, "I will definitely obtain this sevai." The householder's wife said, "If you obtain the sevai, I will believe that you have performed prasravan in my nasikaput." 219/4. "Whose house is this?" Asking this, the Muni went among the council. He asked, "Who is such-and-such a person?" The people said, "What is your purpose with that person? Ask us, he is very miserly, he will not give you anything." 219/5. The Muni said, "If he is not one of the six women-headed men, he will give. I will ask him in the middle of the council." 219/6. When the people asked, the Muni told the names of the six lowest men: 1. Shvetangguli, 2. Bakoddayak, 3. Kinkara, 4. Snayak, 5. Grdhraivaridhi, 6. Hadjna." 219/7. That person said, "You ask, I am not such a person." The Muni said, "I went to your house before, but your wife prohibited it." The husband ordered his wife to climb the male, saying, "You bring down the jaggery from above, I will feed the Brahmanas." The wife climbed the nishreni. 219/8. The householder removed the nishreni from there and gave the Muni sufficient sevai in donation. The wife saw all this. She said in a loud voice, "Don't give him, don't give him." The Muni put his finger in his nose and showed her that I have performed prasravan in your nose. Doing so creates animosity between husband and wife, sometimes even suicide from humiliation, and disrespect for the sermon. 219/9, 10. In the city of Rajagriha, the small disciple of Dharmaruchi Acharya was Muni Ashadhabhuti. Once he entered the house of a royal jester for alms. There he received a very valuable laddu in alms. He thought this would be for the Acharya, again he made the form of a Kane Muni and obtained modak, thinking that this would have to be given to the Upadhyaya. Again he made the form of a Kubja Muni and obtained the third modak and thought that this would have to be given to the Sanghatak-Sadhu. Finally, he made the form of a Kusthi Sadhu and obtained the fourth modak. The jester saw the scene of transformation. He started inviting him daily and giving him sufficient modak in donation.

**219/11.** He told both daughters, "You must subdue them with gifts and affection." One day, in solitude, they attracted the muni's mind. Aashaadhbhuti went to the guru and told him everything. The muni abandoned ling-rajoharan. He married the nat-kanyas. (The nat told the daughters, "He constantly remembers the guru, therefore") he is of noble nature. 

**219/12.** In Rajgriha, the king ordered a play without women (natnis) one day. Both nat-kanyas, intoxicated, went to the upper floor of the house and slept.

The nat understood through gestures that Aashaadhbhuti had become detached. To continue his livelihood properly, he created a play called "Rashtrapal."

**219/14.** The play depicted Bharat, born in the Ikshvaku dynasty, attaining the light of kaivalya in an ideal home. People threw garlands and other offerings. Accepting the gifts and giving them to the nat-kanyas, Aashaadhbhuti started to return for re-initiation. The king tried to stop him, but he did not return.

**219/15.** (The same play was performed in Kusumpur Nagar). Seeing it, 500 Kshatriyas became monks. (Seeing that this play would make the earth devoid of Kshatriyas) the play was burned. For the sick, long-penitent, guest, and sthavir, the consumption of maya-pind is also permitted as an exception.

**220.** "Today, I will only consume this substance (modak, etc.)" - due to this thought, he does not consume other substances that are easily available, this is lobha-pind. Or, knowing a smooth substance to be filled with bhadrakras, consuming it in large quantities is also lobha-pind.

**220/1,2.** During the modak festival in Champa Nagari, the muni resolved, "I will consume Singhkesharak modak in alms." He started prohibiting other substances. Instead of saying "dharmalab", he started saying "Singhkesharak". At midnight, he uttered "Singhkesharak" at the house of the shraddha. The shravak filled the bowl with modaks. The shravak asked, "Has the time of purimarth arrived?" The muni used the opportunity. (Seeing the stars in the sky) the muni's mind became calm. The muni said, "You have given me the right inspiration at the right time." The muni performed the parishthapan of the modaks. While doing penance, he attained kevalgyan.

**221.** There are two types of sanstav - sambandhisanstav and vachanasanstav or shlaghasanstav. Each has two sub-types - purvasanstav and paschatanstav.

222. Praise of parents, etc., is called *purvasanstav* (prior praise), and praise of father-in-law, mother-in-law, etc., is called *paschatanstav* (posterior praise). A sadhu interacts with householders with either prior or posterior praise. 222/1. A muni who has gone out for alms, knowing his own age and the age of the householder, establishes a connection accordingly, saying, "My mother was like this," or "My sister, daughter, or granddaughter was like this." 222/2. A muni entering a house for alms, seeing a woman, sheds tears with emotion, saying, "My mother was like you." The woman places her breast in the muni's mouth, which creates a bond of affection between them. She may also donate her widowed daughter-in-law. 223. The faults of *paschatanstav* are these: A mother-in-law may donate her widowed daughter. If a muni says, "My wife was like this," her husband may kill him immediately, or the muni's vow may be broken (due to mental disturbance) if the woman behaves like a wife. 224. The householder may think, "This muni is a magician, a flatterer, he is insulting us by calling us mother, wife, etc." Thinking this, with a narrow mind, she may drive the muni out of the house. If the householders are virtuous, they become committed to the sadhu. 225. The *purvasanstav* related to words is when a muni praises the good and bad qualities of the donor before he gives food and drink. 225/1. The muni says, "This is the one whose qualities roam unbound in all ten directions. For so many days we have heard about you, today we have seen you directly." 226. *Paschatanstav* is when a muni praises the good and bad qualities of the donor after he gives food and drink. 226/1. "Your qualities are truly prevalent everywhere. My eyes have become pure by seeing you. Before, I had doubts about your qualities, now, seeing you, my mind is free from doubt." 227. The example of the *bhiksu-upasaka* regarding knowledge and the *murunda* king regarding mantras is given for the formulation of knowledge and mantras. 227/1,2. The sadhus gathered and began to talk, "The *bhiksu-upasaka* is very narrow-minded, stingy. He doesn't give anything to the sadhus." (One sadhu said), "If you all wish, I can get ghee, jaggery, and clothes, etc., from him." That muni went there and enchanted the house with knowledge and mantras. He asked the sadhu, "What should I give you?" The sadhu said, "Ghee, jaggery, and clothes, etc." Upon giving the donation, the muni withdrew the knowledge. When he was in his natural state, the *bhiksu-upasaka* asked, "Who has...

**228.** A person who is empowered by Vidya or any other person can harm a Muni by using counter-Vidya like Stambhan etc. There is a misconception among people that these Munis are sinners, illusionists, and karma-doers. Due to this misconception, they may be suppressed or harmed by the kings.

**179**

**228/1.** As the Padalipta Acharya rotated the index finger on the knee, the headache of King Murund ceased.

**229.** (There are the following two drawbacks of using mantras -) A person who is empowered by a mantra or any other person can paralyze a Sadhu by using a counter-mantra. (There is a misconception among people that) these Sadhus are sinners, illusionists, and karma-doers. The use of mantras can be done in exceptional situations for the benefit of the Sangha.

**230.** Regarding the disappearance by the use of powder, there are examples of Samita Acharya in Chanakya's Yoga subject related to Padalepa, a young woman in the matter of original karma, and two queens in the matter of marriage, conception, and abortion.

**231.** The same drawbacks that are mentioned in the context of mantras and Vidya should be known in the case of powders like Vashikaran etc. The use of powder by a Muni can create animosity towards many Munis and can even destroy them.

**231/1.** There are two types of auspicious and inauspicious Yogas - Aaharya and Anaaharya. There are two types of Aaharya - Agharsh and Dhoopvas. Anaaharya is - Padapralepa etc.

**231/2.** In the island (called Brahma) between the Krishna and Venna rivers, five hundred Tapas lived. On festival days, the head of the community would cross the Krishna river after applying Pad-Lepa. People would honor him.

**231/3.** People would slander in front of the Shravakas saying that your Guru has no power. Samitasuri explained

4. Those that are consumed with water etc. are Aaharya Yogas. There are two types of these - Agharsh, i.e., the substance that is ground and consumed with water etc., and Dhoopvas - the incense of fragrant substances. Both powder and fragrance are in the form of Kshoda. The commentator clarifies the difference between them by saying that dry or moist Kshoda produced from ordinary substances is called 'powder'. The very fine form of Kshoda produced from fragrant substances is called 'fragrance' (Mavru p. 143).

1. The ascetic crosses the river by smearing his feet with mud to avoid the water. The śrāvakas invited the ascetic to their home and said that not washing his feet would be disrespectful, so they washed the ascetic's feet. 2. When he started to leave after taking alms, he began to drown in the river due to the lack of the foot-covering. When the ācārya-samiti crossed the river, both banks were found to be connected. Seeing this, five hundred ascetics were amazed. Along with the head of the community, all the ascetics became his disciples. This group became famous as the Brahmaśākhā. 3. Violating someone's celibacy or inserting one's own genitalia into another is considered a root karma. 4. When the time of the girl's marriage was near, the mother became worried due to the girl's different genitalia. She told the muni everything. The muni gave her ācamana and pānauṣadha, due to which she became capable of lifelong sexual intercourse. 5. There was a quarrel between the husband and wife. The śrāvikā became distressed that her husband would bring a co-wife. She told the whole matter to the muni named Jaṃghāparijita. The muni gave her a medicine for the difference in genitalia. Knowing about the different genitalia, the husband prohibited the marriage. (Knowing this) he may develop great hatred, and this may also lead to the neglect of the scripture. 6. If the unmarried daughter of marriageable age is not married, she may bring disgrace to your family. It is said in the world that for every drop of blood that falls from the menstruating maiden, her mother goes to hell. 7. (The ascetic said to the housewife) Your son is the cause of your family's lineage, gotra, and fame. He has now grown up, why don't you get him married? Even later, his marriage will have to be arranged. Lest he elopes (with a promiscuous woman) without getting married. 8. The muni asked the queen, "What is your distress and worry?" She said, "My co-wife is pregnant." The muni said, "Do not be distressed, I will also get you pregnant." 9. The queen said, "Even if I have a son, he will not become the crown prince because he will be the younger one, the co-wife's son will become the crown prince." The muni gave medicine for the abortion of the co-wife's fetus. Knowing this, there may be hatred towards the muni and even bodily destruction.

**232.** Performing *sankaḍi-vivah-bhoj* (a type of marriage feast) and other such activities leads to the violation of the earth and other living beings. On one hand, *akṣatayoṇitva* (having a child) leads to the tendency towards action. (From conception, a child is born.) On the other hand, abortion leads to the disrespect of the teachings. *Kṣatayoṇitva* (having a child through a non-virgin) leads to *bhogāntarāya* (obstacles in the enjoyment of life) for the entire life. 

**233.** In this way, the *udgama-utpādana* (origin and production) defects lead to the acceptance of the *piṇḍa* (body) which is pure and purified by *grahaṇa-viśodhi* (purification through acceptance).

**234.** The defects of *utpādana* (production) should be known in relation to the *sādhu* (righteous person). The defects of *grahaṇaiṣaṇā* (desire for acceptance) are *ātmasamutthita* (arising from oneself) and *parasamutthita* (arising from others), which I will explain further.

**235.** The two defects of *grahaṇaiṣaṇā* are *śankita* (doubtful) and *bhāvataḥ apariṇata* (not fully matured in feeling) - these two defects are *sādhu-samutthita* (arising from the righteous person). The remaining eight defects should be known as arising from the *gṛhastha* (householder) as a rule.

**236.** There are four *nikṣepa* (deposits) of *grahaṇaiṣaṇā* - *nāma* (name), *sthāpanā* (establishment), *dravya* (substance), and *bhāva* (feeling). The *dravya* *grahaṇaiṣaṇā* is exemplified by the 'monkey troop', and there are ten types of *bhāva* *grahaṇaiṣaṇā*.

**236/1.** Seeing a forest section with rotten and yellow leaves, the leader of the monkey troop sent pairs of monkeys to search for a new location. The troop leader went there with his troop.

**236/2.** The troop leader himself observed the forest section from all sides. While wandering, he reached the edge of a ravine.

**236/3.** He saw the footprints of animals entering the ravine, but he did not see any footprints coming out. He warned the troop - "You all stay on the bank and drink water from the stream, this ravine is not safe." (This is an example of *dravya* *grahaṇaiṣaṇā*.)

**237.** There are ten defects of *aiṣaṇā* (desire):

1. *Śankita* (doubtful)
2. *Mṛkṣita* (rejected)
3. *Nikkṣipta* (deposited)
4. *Pihita* (hidden)
5. *Sanhata* (combined)
6. *Dayaka* (giving)
7. *Unmiśra* (mixed)
8. *Apariṇata* (not fully matured)
9. *Lipta* (attached)
10. *Chardita* (vomited)

**238.** There are four options for *śankita* (doubtful):

1. Doubtful in both acceptance and eating.
2. Doubtful in acceptance, not in eating.

3. Doubtful in food
• Not in taking.
4. Neither doubtful in taking nor doubtful in food.
-
If doubtful in both taking and food, or in one of them, then he becomes associated with the doubt fault. Of the twenty-five faults, including sixteen Udgama faults and nine Aeshana faults, he becomes associated with the fault from which he is doubtful. The fourth option (not being doubtful in both taking and food) is pure.
Pinḍi
238/1. Sixteen faults of Udgama, including Adhakarma, and nine faults of Aeshana, including Prakshit - these are twenty-five faults. The last option is pure.
238/2. Sixteen faults of Udgama and nine faults of Aeshana, excluding doubt - these twenty-five faults should be said without doubt.
239. A Chhadmastha, Shrutagyani, Munis who is diligent and righteous, even if he acquires one of the twenty-five faults, is pure by the evidence of Shrutagyan.
239/1. Generally, a Muni who is Shrutopayukta (in Pinḍinirukti etc.) even if he takes impure food, still eats it as a Kevalgyani, otherwise Shrutagyan becomes invalid.
240. If the Sutra is invalid, then there will be a lack of character, and if there is a lack of character, then there will be a lack of liberation, and if there is a lack of liberation, then the tendency of initiation will become meaningless.
240/1. Even seeing the abundant alms material given at home, the Muni is not able to ask questions out of shame. He takes alms with doubt and consumes it in a state of doubt. (This is the first option.)
240/2. The Muni took alms with a doubtful heart. Another Muni, purifying it, said that this food was made for a guest etc. due to circumstances, or it was Prahenaka - food material that came from another house. Hearing this, the Muni consumed the alms without doubt. (This is the second option of Chaturbhangi.)
240/3. While criticizing his Samyak in front of the Guru, the Muni thinks with doubt that I have received abundant alms in such and such house, other Munis have also received abundant alms from the same house, therefore it must be faulty. Thinking this, he consumes the alms in a state of doubt. (This is the third option of Chaturbhangi.)

1. For example, if doubt arises in the Adhakarma fault, then the Muni who takes and consumes that food becomes associated with the Adhakarma fault (Mavṛ P. 147).

**240/4. (Disciple asks) If doubt is a fault, then even if there is doubt about pure alms, it will become impure, and if one takes alms without doubt, it will be free from fault.**

**241. Impure result, being one-sided, makes the eligible ineligible. Pure result (with the method prescribed by the scriptures) makes the ineligible eligible through investigation.**

**183**

**242. There are two types of *mrkshit* - with consciousness and without consciousness. There are three types of *mrkshit* with consciousness and two types without consciousness.**

**243. The three types of *mrkshit* with consciousness are: *mrkshit* with earth body, *mrkshit* without body, and *mrkshit* with plant body. The two types of *mrkshit* without consciousness are: *garhit* and *agarhit*. There is a distinction between *kalpya* and *akalpya* in this.**

**243/1. There are two types of *mrkshit* with earth body and consciousness: dry and moist. The hand or vessel that is touched by dry or moist *mrkshit* with earth body and consciousness becomes *mrkshit* with earth body and consciousness. I will explain *mrkshit* without body further.**

**243/2. There are four types of *mrkshit* without body: *purahkarma*, *paschatkarma*, *sasnigdha*, and *udakardra*. The hand or vessel that is touched by the smooth pieces of a large and endless plant, which is filled with excellent juice, becomes *mrkshit* with plant body.**

**243/3. The remaining three bodies - light, air, and space - do not become *mrkshit* in their conscious, mixed, or moist forms.**

**244. There are four options for *mrkshit* from *mrkshit* with earth body and consciousness, etc.:**

* **Hand *mrkshit* and vessel *mrkshit*.**
* **Hand *mrkshit*, not vessel *mrkshit*.**
* **Vessel *mrkshit*, not hand *mrkshit*.**
* **Neither hand *mrkshit* nor vessel *mrkshit*.**

**The first three options are prohibited, the fourth option is allowed.**

**245. *Mrkshit* without consciousness is also of four types, as before, regarding the hand and vessel. In all four options, there is acceptance and rejection. Alms are acceptable from a hand or vessel that is touched by *garhit* *mrkshit*, and *garhit* *mrkshit* is prohibited.**

**245/1. The hand or vessel that is touched by *agarhit* juice, honey, ghee, oil, jaggery, etc., which is in contact with living beings, is acceptable.**

**1. The commentator clarifies this verse by saying that impure food obtained through pure investigation according to the scriptures becomes pure because scriptural knowledge is the proof in practice (Mavri P. 148).**

The alms given are also described, the reason being that there should be no violence to flies, ants, etc. 245/2. It is described that taking alms with a hand or vessel contaminated by meat, fat, blood, and intoxicants (alcohol) is prohibited in the world, and taking alms with a hand or vessel contaminated by urine and excrement is also prohibited in the world and the transcendental world. 246. There are two types of deposition on the six bodies, etc. - conscious and mixed. These have two types each - immediate and continuous. 247. There are six possible types of deposition between earth, water, fire, air, plants, and hell. Each has two types of deposition - immediate and continuous. Only in the fire body are there seven types of deposition from the earth body, etc. 248. The deposition of conscious earth on the conscious earth body, in the same way, the deposition of water body, fire body, plant body, air body, and hell body occurs. 249. The deposition of the remaining living bodies is also like the earth body. In these, there is one option of self-location and five other locations. 250. In the same way (like the deposition of conscious on conscious), the deposition of mixed earth on conscious earth, etc., the deposition of conscious earth, etc. on mixed earth, etc., the deposition of mixed earth on mixed earth occurs. Both conscious and mixed have deposition on the unconscious. 251. In the deposition where there is a fourfold division based on conscious and mixed, in all four divisions - options, in each and in the immediate and continuous deposition of infinite plants, the consumption of food is unacceptable. 251/1. Or, based on the opposing side, the fourfold division is as follows:
1. Conscious on conscious-mixed. 3. Conscious-mixed on unconscious. 2. Unconscious on conscious-mixed. 4. Unconscious on unconscious.
1. Mavri P. 150; This is to be understood as stated with reference to the excellent practice of the Jina-kalpikas, etc. The sthavira-kalpikas, however, take ghee, etc., even if it is contaminated with sugar, etc., and even if it is protected by Asoka, etc. - The commentator says that this instruction is from the perspective of the Jina-kalpikas. The sthavira-kalpikas can take alms with hands contaminated with ghee, sugar, etc., as per the rules. 2. The six types of deposition related to the earth body are as follows: 1. Earth body on earth body 2. Earth body on water body 3. Earth body on fire body 4. Earth body on air body 5. Earth body on plant body 6. Earth body on hell body. Similarly, there are six divisions of the water body, etc. (Mavri P. 151). 3. For the seven divisions of the fire body, see the translation of verse 252. 4. The deposition of the earth body on the earth body is self-location deposition. 5. The deposition of the water body, etc., on the earth body is other-location deposition. 6.

The first three bhangas do not mention the consumption of bhaktapan. In the fourth bhang, consuming bhaktapan is permissible. 251/2. If something is deposited on an achiṭṭa dravya, a sachiṭṭa dravya, or a miśra dravya, then there is anantar or parampār margaṇā. 251/3. If something like avagāhima-pakvānn is established on the earth for a long time, then it is anantar nikṣipta, and if it is deposited on something like a piṭharaka that is kept on the earth, then it is parampār nikṣipta. If something like navanīta is deposited on sachiṭṭa udaka, then it is anantar nikṣipta, and if it is deposited on something like a boat that is situated in the water, then it is parampār nikṣipta. 252. There are seven types of fire: vidhyāta, murmura, angāra, aprāpta-jvalā, prāpta-jvalā, sama-jvalā, and vyutkrānta-jvalā. Each has two divisions: anantar and parampār. It is permissible to take ikshurasa from a kṭāha, etc., that is used to cook yantra-ikshurasa, which is smeared with mud, carefully without dropping it. 252/1. The fire that is not visible at first but becomes visible later when fuel is added is called vidhyāta. The half-vidhyāta fire particles of āpingala color are murmura. Fire without flames is called angāra. 252/2. The fire that is on the stove but not touching the vessel is called aprāpta-jvalā. The fire that touches the piṭharaka is called prāpta-jvalā, the fire that touches the upper part of the vessel is called sama-jvalā, and the fire that reaches the top of the vessel that is placed on the stove is called vyutkrānta-jvalā. 253. It is permissible to take ikshurasa from a large-mouthed karahi or vessel that is smeared with mud on the sides without dropping it, but it should not be immediately placed on the fire, i.e., it should not be too hot. 253/1. Water that is not too hot, resulting from guḍarasa, can also be consumed. If the water that is in the karahi does not condense up to the upper part (karna) of the karahi, then it is permissible, but if it condenses and falls into the fire, then it is not permissible.

1. For the explanation of the words vidhyāta, etc., see the translation of 252/1,2 and Mavṛ P. 152. 2. The commentator, while explaining this gāthā, says that the meaning of the mud coating all around the vessel is that if some drops fall while taking the ikshurasa, then the mud should absorb them, they should not fall on the fire in the middle of the stove. The meaning of the large-mouthed vessel is that while taking out the ikshurasa, the juice should not touch the edge of the piṭharaka and the upper part of the piṭharaka should not break (Mavṛ P. 153). 3. If the water that is poured into the karahi in which guḍ was previously cooked is only slightly hot, then it can still be taken because due to the guḍarasa that is stuck to the karahi, the water quickly becomes achiṭṭa (Mavṛ P. 153).

253/2. Based on four conditions: a pan with mud on its sides, lukewarm sugarcane juice, sugarcane juice not poured out, and not touching the upper part of the back while taking out the substance (Aghattant), there are sixteen possibilities. The first possibility is permitted, the rest are not. 

253/3. To calculate the value of these possibilities (bhangas), one should multiply the pairs of the four conditions. The sixteen possibilities will be formed as follows: (four conditions each) 

1. Aghattant means not touching the upper part of the back while taking out the substance. 

2. The author has created sixteen possibilities based on four conditions: Parvavalipt (mud on the sides), Antyunshna (lukewarm), Aparishaati (not poured out), and Aghattant (not touching). 

The commentator has created these possibilities as follows:

1. First row: Sixteen possibilities with alternating short and long syllables.
2. Second row: Sixteen possibilities with two short and two long syllables.
3. Third row: Sixteen possibilities with four short, then four long, then four short, and then four long syllables.
4. Fourth row: Sixteen possibilities with eight short and then eight long syllables.

These will be established as follows:

ISISISISISISIS IS IIS SIISSIISS 11 SS ।।। Issss ।। ।। ssss
11! IIIII SS SS SS SS

By taking one possibility from each row, starting from the bottom and moving upwards, the sixteen possibilities will be formed as follows:

(1.) ।। ।। (2.) ।।। (3.) |15। (4.) | ISS (5.) । ।। (6.) IS IS (7.) । (8.) Isss (9.)s।।। (10.)SIS (11.) SISI (12.)S ISS (13.)ss || (14.)SSIS (15.) sss। (16.)sssss

In these, the parts with straight lines are pure, and the parts with the letter 's' are impure. Of these sixteen possibilities, the first is permitted. The remaining fifteen are forbidden.

A chart of the possibilities based on the four conditions can be presented as follows:

Parvavalipt | Antyunshna | Aparishaati | Aghattant |  |

The sixteen bhangas are obtained as follows when the pairs are multiplied by the short-long (pure and impure) pairs alternately (from the perspective of the knower) from the left:

- By multiplying the first two pairs by two, we get four.
- By multiplying four by the third pair (i.e., two), we get eight.
- By multiplying eight by the fourth pair (i.e., two), we get sixteen.

2. Due to consuming extremely hot substances, the hot vessel may slip from the hand, burning the muni's hands and feet. This is **aatmaviraadhana**. If the hot vessel slips from the hand of the giver, burning him, it is **paraviraadhana** (Mavri P. 154).
3. The first **chaturbhangi** arises from the combination of **sachitt** and **mishra** substances. The second arises from the combination of **sachitt** and **achitt**, and the third **chaturbhangi** arises from the combination of **mishra** and **achitt** substances. These **chaturbhangis** will be formed as follows:

- **Sachitt** from **pihit** **sachitt** **deya vastu** (object to be given).
- **Mishra** from **pihit** **sachitt** **deya vastu**.
- **Sachitt** from **pihit** **mishra** **deya vastu**.
- **Mishra** from **pihit** **mishra** **deya vastu**.

**Second Chaturbhangi**

- **Sachitt** from **pihit** **sachitt** **deya vastu**.
- **Achitt** from **pihit** **sachitt** **deya vastu**.
- **Sachitt** from **pihit** **achitt** **deya vastu**.
- **Achitt** from **pihit** **achitt** **deya vastu**.

**Third Chaturbhangi**

- **Mishra** from **pihit** **mishra** **deya vastu**.
- **Mishra** from **pihit** **achitt** **deya vastu**.
- **Achitt** from **pihit** **mishra** **deya vastu**.
- **Achitt** from **pihit** **achitt** **deya vastu**.

In the first **chaturbhangi**, it is not conceivable to consume food in all the **bhangas**. In the second and third **chaturbhangis**, it is not conceivable in the first three **bhangas**, but it is permissible in the last **bhangas** (Mavri P. 154).

The first three options in each of the four categories are not permissible, while the fourth option is permissible. 257. Just as in the case of *nikshipta dvara* (verse 251/1), the options are described as *saccitta*, *acitta*, and *misra* based on their combination, so too should it be understood in the case of *pihita*. Only the third *bhang* of the second and third *chaturbhangi* has diversity. 258, 259. An object heated by embers is *anantar pihita*. An object heated by embers, *shrava* (liquor) etc. is *parampar pihita*. In the case of an object heated by embers etc., the air that is *atirohita* (completely covered) is *anantar pihita*, and if that air is covered by *drti* (vision) etc. filled with air, then it is *parampar pihita*. In the case of plants, the fruit etc. that is *atirohita* is *anantar pihita*, and the fruit covered by *chhabak*, *pitharak* etc. filled with fruits is *parampar pihita*. Similarly, in the case of the *trasakaya*, the object that is covered by *kachhap*, *kitika-pancti* etc. is *anantar pihita*, and the object covered by *kachhap*, *kitika* etc. that is contained in *pitharak* etc. is *parampar pihita*. 259/1. The *chaturbhangi* of *pihita* with respect to *acitta* objects is as follows:
* Heavy object covered by a heavy object.
* Heavy object covered by a light object.
* Light object covered by a heavy object.
* Light object covered by a light object.
In these, the first and third options are not permissible, while the second and fourth options are permissible. 260. There are three types of *sanhata*: *saccitta*, *acitta*, and *misra*. There are three *chaturbhangi* of *sanhrta*. The first three *bhang* in each category are prohibited, while the last *bhang* is permissible. 261. Just as in the case of *nikshipta dvara*, there are combinations of *saccitta*, *acitta*, and *misra* terms, so too should it be understood in the case of *sanhrta dvara*. Only the third *bhang* of the second and third *chaturbhangi* has diversity in the method of *margana*. 262. If the object given by the donor contains *adeya* (unacceptable) food etc., then it is a *sanhrta* fault to give the food etc. after removing the unacceptable food etc. and placing it on the ground or elsewhere. 263, 263/1. The *saccitta* object located in the container is *sanharana-chhardana* (collection-vomiting) on all six *kaya* (bodies) including earth etc.
1. For details, see *Mavri P. 156*. 2. While explaining this verse, the commentator says that in the case of a heavy object, if the object falls from the hand while lifting it, there is a possibility of injury to the feet etc. or a broken limb. In the second *bhang*, the object to be given is heavy, but it is not necessary to lift it and give it, it can also be given from a bowl etc., therefore, it is permissible to accept alms in the second option (Mavri P. 155). 3. Mavri P. 156; The word 'tu' at the end of the verse indicates that the author intends to prohibit the acceptance of food in all four *bhang* of the first *chaturbhangi*. 4. For details, see the commentary on verse 256 and Mavri P. 156.

Both types of *sanharana* (collection) are fourfold based on the *adhara* (base) and *sanhriyamana* (object being collected). The fourfold classification is as follows:

* Dry on dry.
* Dry on moist.
* Moist on dry.
* Moist on moist.

**263/2.** Each of these fourfold classifications of dry, etc., is further divided into four based on *stoka* (small quantity) and *bahu* (large quantity), such as:

* Small dry on small dry.
* Small dry on large dry.
* Large dry on small dry.
* Large dry on large dry.

**263/3.** The option where a large quantity of dry is collected on a small quantity of dry is *kalpaneya* (permissible). Additionally, in the three classifications of dry on moist, moist on dry, or moist on moist, the *aahara* (food) is *agrahya* (not acceptable). If the object to be collected is light in weight, and there is a lighter object on top of it, which is then removed, then that object is *kalpaneya*.

**264.** When lifting and placing a large vessel, the giver experiences pain. People criticize, saying, "How greedy this monk is, who does not consider the pain of others." While lifting a heavy vessel, the giver may suffer death, broken limbs, or burning of the body. The giver may develop aversion towards the monk, there may be a cessation of other offerings due to this offering, and the scattering of the contents from the heavy vessel may lead to the destruction of the *shatkayas* (six categories of beings).

**189**

**264/1.** If the object is dry on dry, and is deposited on a small quantity or a large quantity, then it is *kalpya* (permissible). If it is deposited as dry on moist, moist on dry, or moist on moist, then it is *anachirna* (not permissible). The collection of a large quantity on a small quantity or a large quantity on a large quantity is *anachirna*. Due to the faults mentioned in the previous verse (verse 264), this is *anachirna*.

**265-270.** There are forty types of *varjaniya dayaka* (undesirable givers):

1. **Balaka** (child) - less than eight years old.
2. **Vridda** (old person) - sixty or seventy years old.
3. **Matta** (intoxicated) - having consumed alcohol.
4. **Unmatta** (possessed) - possessed by a ghost or spirit.

**1.** To understand this fourfold classification, refer to the translation and commentary of verse 256.

37. A giver who is devoid of harm. 38. A woman who gives an established object for another Sadhu. 39. A woman who gives impure things even though she has knowledge of the object.
40. A woman who gives impure things due to ignorance of the object. 271. Some Acharyas believe that it is appropriate to accept offerings from the first twenty-five types of givers. It is permissible to accept from them for specific purposes, but not otherwise. Some believe that one should avoid accepting from givers from 26 to 40. It is permissible to accept from children, etc. (givers from 1 to 25). 272. (A new Shravaka) girl went to the field after delivering a message. The Sadhu accepted a substantial amount of alms from the girl. When the mother asked for food, the girl said, "I gave it all to the Sadhu." This leads to disregard for the teachings and creates animosity, and people say that these are robber Sadhus who are mocking the robes of a Sadhu. 273. The saliva of the elder keeps dripping, his hands tremble, so the object to be given may fall from his hand or the elder may fall. The elder is usually not the owner of the house, so if he gives something, the householder may feel animosity towards the Sadhu, the elder, or both. 274. A drunk person may embrace the Sadhu, break the vessel. A drunk person vomiting may soil the Sadhu or his vessel. These monks are impure - such is the talk in the world. The same faults apply to an insane giver, only he does not vomit. 275. When accepting alms from a trembling giver, the object to be given may fall out, and falling around the vessel may soil it. Similarly, these are the same faults of a feverish giver. The special thing is that there is also a possibility of infection. People talk about these Sadhus accepting alms from feverish people. 276. Accepting alms from a blind giver leads to gossip among people. A blind giver may stumble and fall, harming the six-bodied beings with his feet. The vessel of the object to be given may break from him. While giving alms, he may soil the vessel from all sides with the object to be given. Accepting alms from someone whose body is shedding leprosy may lead to the spread of the disease. 277. Accepting alms from a giver wearing sandals may cause the giver to slip and fall. Accepting alms from a giver wearing handcuffs and shackles causes suffering to the giver and disgust among people due to impurity.
1. For the expansion of the story, see Pari. 3, Katha San. 48. 2. Accepting an object to be given on which saliva has fallen leads to condemnation in the world. 3. A person wearing sandals goes to defecate and urinate, and not cleaning them afterwards leads to disgust in the world that these Sadhus accept alms from impure people (Mav P. 160).

##  Chapter 192:  The Prohibition of Accepting Alms from Certain Donors

**Regarding the Prohibition of Accepting Alms from Certain Donors:**

**192.**  It is considered inappropriate to accept alms from a person with a severed hand, as it can cause disgust among people due to the impurity and the possibility of the offered item falling to the ground. Similarly, accepting alms from a person with a severed foot carries the same risks.  Furthermore, a person with a severed foot may fall while walking to offer alms, causing harm to the soul.

**278.** Accepting alms from a eunuch can lead to self-inflicted harm, harm to others, or both.  Repeatedly accepting alms from them can lead to excessive familiarity, which may cause distress or anger in the eunuch or the monk.  People may also develop a sense of disgust, believing that the monk is also a eunuch.

**279.**  A pregnant woman's movements while offering alms can disturb the fetus.  If a woman with a child offers alms while carrying the child, the child may be mistaken for a piece of meat by a cat or other animal, leading to its destruction.

**280.**  A woman washing her hands before offering alms while eating can lead to the violation of water.  If she offers alms with unclean hands without rinsing them, it can cause disgust among people.  Similarly, accepting alms from a woman churning yogurt with yogurt-stained hands can lead to the destruction of the life forms present in the yogurt.

**281.**  Accepting alms from a woman grinding, pounding, or crushing can lead to the destruction of water, seeds, and other life forms.  If a woman is shelling chickpeas or other grains, accepting alms from her can lead to the burning of the chickpeas if the alms-giving process takes too long.  If a woman is spinning cotton, weaving, or processing it, she may wash her hands after offering alms, which can lead to the destruction of water-dwelling life forms.

**282.**  A woman with a living being in her hand, such as salt, water, fire, air, a vessel filled with air, fruit, fish, etc., is called a "Shatkayavyagrahasta" (one with six types of life forms in her hand).  It is forbidden to accept alms from her because she may place these items on the ground, step on them, or crush them with her body parts, including her hands.

**283.**  Women who engage in activities such as digging the earth, bathing with conscious water, washing clothes with conscious water, watering trees, (lighting a fire or throwing a vessel filled with conscious air), cutting vegetables, drying vegetables in the sun, cleaning rice, and killing fish in the sixth life form (Triskaaya) are all involved in violence against living beings.  Therefore, it is not appropriate to accept alms from their hands.

**Notes:**

1.  The commentator Malayagiri mentions another reason for avoiding accepting alms from a woman with a child: the monk's hands become soiled from food, and the dry, food-stained hands become rough, which can cause pain to the child when picked up.
2.  The original text does not mention the harm caused by women who engage in activities related to the life forms of fire and air.  This information is based on the commentary and is therefore enclosed in parentheses.

284. Some Acharyas believe that it is not permissible to accept food offered by a woman who wears earrings made of badar (a type of fruit) and other ornaments, and who has a flower of the mustard plant (siddhārthaka) in her hair.
284/1. Other Acharyas believe that this is not a transgression of the ten faults of *eṣaṇā* (desire), and therefore it is not forbidden to accept food offered by a woman adorned with badar and other ornaments. In response to this, it is said that the acceptance of the food by the giver itself constitutes the transgression.
285. If a woman offers alms with her hands and vessel contaminated with living beings, it is a violation of the beings clinging to her hands and vessel. If a large vessel is tilted to offer alms, there is a possibility of harming ants, insects, etc., that may be present there. Similarly, there are the same faults in lifting a large vessel to offer alms.
286. The same faults that were mentioned earlier in the section on "unopened doors" apply to accepting alms from a woman who offers the belongings of many people. If a woman offers alms that she has stolen from her husband or daughter-in-law, there is a possibility of the faults of acceptance, bondage, etc.
287. Offering alms with the intention of using it for sacrifices, etc., for the *prābhṛtika* (a type of offering) leads to the faults of instigation, etc. There are three types of hell: *tiryag* (animal realm), *ūrdhva* (heavenly realm), and *adhaḥ* (hell realm). A monk should not accept alms that has been set aside for non-Jains or for the sick, etc.
288. A giver who offers something out of compassion for the monks, or who knowingly offers food with the faults of *ādhākarma* (half-hearted action) and other *eṣaṇā* faults, is an *ābhōgadāyaka* (unworthy giver). A giver who offers such food out of ignorance or due to a lack of understanding is an *anābhōgadāyaka* (unworthy giver). Both these types of givers are unsuitable.
288/1. If a child offers only alms, there is no need for deliberation, and the alms can be accepted. Alms can also be accepted from a child who is instructed by his mother. If the child offers a lot of alms, there is a need for deliberation, and the alms can be accepted with the permission of the mother, etc.

1. A large vessel is sometimes lifted for practical reasons, and therefore many living beings gather underneath it. Tilting or lifting it can lead to the killing of these beings, and also cause pain to the giver (M.V.P. 162).
2. See the translation of verse 180, M.V.P. 114.
3. Accepting alms set aside for non-Jains, etc., leads to the fault of *adattādāna* (accepting what was not given). A monk should bring the food given for the sick, etc., to the sick person. If they do not accept it, the monk should return it to the giver. If the giver says that if the sick monk does not accept the alms, then the monk should accept it, then the food becomes permissible for the monk (M.V.P. 162).
4. While explaining this verse, the commentator says that if the mother is standing nearby and gives permission, then the monk can accept alms from the child. If the child offers alms, the monk should ask why they want to offer so much alms today. In this situation, if the mother gives permission, then accepting the alms is permissible (M.V.P. 163).

288/2. If the householder is a householder, his hands are trembling, but the object to be given is in the hands of another, or he is strong-bodied, then alms may be accepted from his hand. If he is secretly intoxicated, is performing a śrāddha, is not distracted, is not under the influence of another, and there is no other householder present, then alms may be accepted from his hand. 288/3. If the person is insane but pure and virtuous, if the hand of the person with a trembling body is steady, if the fever of the person with fever has subsided, if the blind person is a śrāvaka, and the object to be given is in the hands of another, or if the blind person has come with the help of another, then the object to be given may be accepted from all of them. 288/4. If a person is afflicted with maṇḍalaprasuptikṣuṣṭha (a particular type of circular leprosy), and there is no other householder present, then alms may be taken from him. Similarly, if a person with a foot disease is stable, if a person wearing shackles is mindful and able to walk, then alms may be taken from his hand. If a person who is disabled in his hands and feet is unable to move around but is sitting, and there is no other householder present, then alms may also be taken from his hand. A person wearing shackles in his hands is not able to give alms, therefore he is prohibited, there is no bhajana there. If a person who has been cut off is able to give alms in the absence of a sāgārika, then it is prescribed to take alms from him. 288/5. If a eunuch is not a pratisevī, then alms may be taken from his hand. Alms may not be taken from the hand of a pregnant woman in the ninth month, or from the hand of a woman who is breastfeeding a child. Similarly, there is bhajana in taking alms from the hand of a woman who is eating, roasting, or pounding. If a woman has raised the pestle to pound rice, and there is no grain on the pestle, and a monk comes in the meantime, and she places the pestle in a blameless place and gives alms, then it is acceptable.

If the Muni arrives while the alms bowl is being picked up, alms can be taken from the hand if the bowl is placed in a proper, defect-free place. 288/6. Alms can be taken from the hand of a woman grinding if she has stopped grinding or is grinding a suitable substance. Alms can be taken from the hand of a woman churning yogurt if her hands are not contaminated with conch shell powder, etc., or from the hand of a woman spinning if her hands are not scratched by conch shell powder, and even if she is spinning with hands scratched by conch shell powder, if she has not washed her hands with water. 288/7. Alms can be taken from the hand of a woman who is twisting cotton if the cotton is not in her hand or if she is not compacting the cotton while lifting it. If there is no subsequent action in the process of picking and pressing cotton, alms can be taken. 288/8. There is no possibility of an exception, i.e., a counter-argument, in the remaining six types of hands engaged in activities. In the absence of a counter-argument, there is a rule not to accept alms. 289. There are three types of *unmiśra* - *saccitta*, *acitta*, and *miśra*. There are three *caturbhanga* of *unmiśra*. In each, the first three options are prohibited, and the fourth option is permissible. 290, 291. In the *sanharana* gate, the *saṁyogika* *bhanga* of *pṛthvīkāya*, etc., are the same as in the *unmiśra* fault. The main difference between the two is that substances are of two types - *dātavya* - suitable for giving to a *sadhu* and *adātavya*. Giving a mixture of both is *unmiśra*. For example, giving rice mixed with *kuśana*, yogurt, etc. In *sanharana*, the *adeya* substance in the vessel is transferred elsewhere, this is the difference between the two. 291/1. Like *sanharana*, there are four options for *unmiśra* - *śuṣka* in *śuṣka* *unmiśra*, etc. There are also four options each for *alpa* and *bahutva* and *ācīrṇa* and *anācīrṇa*, similar to *sanharana*.

1. For details, see *Gāthā* 256 commentary. The word 'tu' in the *gāthā* implies that in the first *caturbhanga*, alms are prohibited in all four options. In the remaining two *caturbhanga*, alms are prohibited in the first three *bhanga*, and alms are permissible in the last *bhanga*. 2. Based on the *bhanga* of each gate, such as *sanharana*, etc., 432 *bhanga* are formed as follows - *saccitta* *pṛthvī* *sanharana* on *saccitta* *pṛthvīkāya*, *saccitta* *pṛthvīkāya* *sanharana* on *saccitta* *apkāya*. Similarly, there are 36 *bhanga* with respect to *svakāya* and *parakāya*. Since each of these has three *caturbhanga* due to *saccitta*, *acitta*, and *miśra* terms, there are 12 variations. Multiplying 12 by 36 gives 432 variations. Similarly, one should know about *unmiśra*, etc. (M.V.P. 165). 3. The *caturbhanga* of *unmiśra* is as follows:
• *śuṣka* in *śuṣka* *unmiśra*. • *śuṣka* in *ārdra* *unmiśra*. • *ārdra* in *śuṣka* *unmiśra*.
• *ārdra* in *ārdra* *unmiśra*. 4. For details, see M.V.P. 165.

292. Aparisnata is of two types: dravya aparisnata and bhava aparisnata. Each has two types: datrusambandhi and grahakasambandhi. Dravya-vishayaka aparisnata is of six types based on the six kayas, and bhava-vishayaka aparisnata is like bhratri, etc. 293. Conscious earth, etc., is aparisnata as long as it is alive, and becomes parisnata when the jiva is destroyed. Here, the example of milk and curd is given. When milk becomes curd, it is called parisnata, and when milk remains in its milk state, it is called aparisnata. 294. When a given object is generally owned by two or more people, and one person desires to give it to the muni, while the others do not, then it is bhava-aparishnata. 295. When two munis go for bhiksha, and one muni considers the given object as eshaniya in his mind, while the other muni does not consider it as eshaniya, then it is also agrahya due to being bhava-aparishnata. There are two types of datru-vishayaka bhava aparisnata: bhratru-vishayaka and swami-vishayaka. Grahitru-vishayaka bhava aparisnata is sadhu-vishayaka. 295/1. The muni should always take only a-lepakrid dravya, because taking lepakrid dravya can lead to paschatkarma, and taking a-lepakrid dravya does not lead to rasagrudhi. Upon hearing this, the shishya says: 295/2. If lepakrid dravya is agrahya due to the possibility of paschatkarma and other faults, then the muni should never eat. The acharya says: "Shishya! The muni who constantly performs tapasya, his tapas, niyama, and samyama are harmed, therefore eating is necessary." 295/3. Lepakrid is sadosha, therefore the shishya says that the muni should not eat for his entire life. If that is not possible, then he should fast for six months and take aachaml. If that is also not possible, then he should take dravya with a little lepa. 295/4, 5. If the muni cannot perform tapasya all the time, then he should perform tapasya continuously for six months and take aachaml in the paranak. If he cannot perform tapasya continuously for six months, then he should reduce it by one day every six months and continue taking aachaml in the paranak until the final reduction reaches fasting. If that is also not possible, then he should take a-lepakrid aachaml every day. 295/6. (The acharya replies): If there is no harm to the muni's yogas in the present and future, then he should perform tapasya for six months, etc. If there is a loss of one day in tapasya, then he should take aachaml in the paranak, as mentioned earlier. If this is not possible, then he should perform aachaml tapasya continuously.

1. The tika-kar Malai Giri explains the difference between anisrishta and datrubhava aparisnata, saying that in anisrishta, the giver is indirect, but in datrubhava aparisnata, the giver is direct (Mavri P. 166).

**295/7.** The disciple asked: "If people born in Maharashtra and Kosala countries earn their livelihood by eating Sauvira food, then why can't the monks earn their livelihood from that food?"

**295/8.** The Acharya said: "The three-fold (trik) of the ascetics is cold, and the same three-fold of the householders is hot. (If an ascetic takes food without taking takra (buttermilk) and tak (a type of fermented drink), then he will suffer from indigestion and other ailments.) Therefore, the consumption of takra etc. is permitted for the monk. The consumption of Timen (a type of food) mixed with pure ghee is allowed only in case of weakness (glanatva) etc., otherwise not."

**295/9.** Even in winter, the three-fold (trik) of the householders - food, clothing, and bed - is hot. Therefore, their food (even without taking takra etc.) is digested by the external and internal heat.

**295/10.** The same three-fold (trik) - food, clothing, and bed - is cold for the monks even in summer. This causes the digestive fire (jathraagni) to become weak, leading to indigestion and other ailments.

**296.** Dry Alepakrid (foods that are not easily digestible)

* Odan - rice etc.
* Sattu - barley etc. powder.
* Kulmasha - black gram.
* Rajmasha - white chana.
* Gol Chana - round chickpeas.
* Vall - husk.
* Tuvari - pigeon pea.
* Masur - lentil.
* Moong - green gram.
* Masha - black gram etc.

**297.** Alpalepakrid (foods that are slightly digestible)

These are the foods that require post-meal rituals (paschatkarma) after consumption.

* Udbedhya - spinach etc. vegetables.
* Peya - barley water.
* Kangu - kodrav grain.
* Takra - buttermilk.
* Ullan - used to moisten rice.
* Soup - cooked soup of moong etc.
* Kanjik - fermented rice water.
* Kwathith - curds etc.

**1.** Trik - food, clothing, and bed.

**2.** A monk travels to many houses for alms. Therefore, the hot food received becomes cold by the time he reaches his dwelling. Once a year, before the rainy season, due to washing clothes and the absence of fire near the dwelling, the bed also becomes cold. Therefore, the consumption of takra etc. is permitted for the ascetic. Takra kindles the digestive fire (Mavri P. 168).

298. All these are *bahulepakrid* substances, they have the rule of *pashchatkarma*
* Milk.
* Yogurt.
* *Kattar* - Large piece of ghee put in *kadhi* etc.
* *Jao* - Drink made from milk. Oil.
* *Phanit* - *Gudpanak*.
* *Ghrut*.
* *Sapindarasa* - Substance produced from dates etc. with very strong taste.

299. There are eight possibilities from the combination of these three - *samsrusht* hand, *samsrusht* vessel and *savasesha* substance, and their opposites - *asamsrusht* hand, *asamsrusht* vessel and *niravasesha* substance.

* *Samsrusht* hand, *samsrusht* vessel and *savasesha* substance.
* *Samsrusht* hand, *samsrusht* vessel and *niravasesha* substance.
* *Samsrusht* hand, *asamsrusht* vessel and *savasesha* substance.
* *Samsrusht* hand, *asamsrusht* vessel and *niravasesha* substance.
* *Asamsrusht* hand, *samsrusht* vessel and *savasesha* substance.
* *Asamsrusht* hand, *samsrusht* vessel and *niravasesha* substance.
* *Asamsrusht* hand, *asamsrusht* vessel and *savasesha* substance.
* *Asamsrusht* hand, *asamsrusht* vessel and *niravasesha* substance.

In these eight possibilities, *oj* - odd possibilities, i.e. 1, 3, 5, 7 are definitely acceptable. The remaining even possibilities - 2, 4, 6, 8 are not acceptable.

300. There are three types of *chhardan* - *sachitt*, *achitt* and *mishra*. It has three *chaturbhag* parts. All its possibilities are prohibited. If these possibilities are accepted, there are faults like *ajna*, *anavastha*, *mithyatva* and *viradhana* etc.

301. The giver who gives *chhardan* of hot substance can get burnt. The *sadnikaya* beings like earth etc. can be burnt. By giving *chhardan* of cold substance, there is *viradhana* of beings like earth etc. In this matter, the example of *madhu bindu* should be known.

1. According to *Brihatkalpabhashya* (1712), mango, *amratak*, *kapitth*, grapes, *matuling* - *bijoura*, banana, date, coconut, *badri* powder and tamarind - all these are *pindarasa* substances.

2. When the hand and vessel are *samsrusht* and after taking alms, the substance remains *savasesha*, then the giver does not wash that vessel, therefore there is no possibility of *pashchatkarma* in odd *bhangas*. But if the substance is given to the *sadhu* completely, then after the donation, the vessel and the hand are washed according to the rule, therefore in the second etc. even *bhangas*, *pashchatkarma* is not conceivable due to the possibility ( *Mavri* p. 169).

3. For the expansion of the story, see *Pari.* 3, *Katha* no. 49.

302. There are four types of *Grassaishana* - *Nama Grassaishana*, *Sthapana Grassaishana*, *Dravya Grassaishana* and *Bhaava Grassaishana*. *Dravya Grassaishana* is exemplified by the fish, and *Bhaava Grassaishana* has five types. 302/1. (To expound the intended meaning) two types of examples should be known - *Charit* and *Kalpit*. Just as fuel is necessary to prove *Odan* etc., similarly, examples are necessary to prove the subject matter. 302/2. While worrying about the depletion of flesh, the fisherman tells the fish, "Why do you worry? Listen to how shameless you are." 302/3. "I escaped from the beak of the heron thrice, thrice I fell into the tide of the corrupt sea, twenty-one times I was caught in the net, once I was thrown into a shallow pond (yet I survived)." 302/4. "Such is my nature, yet you are resorting to the same deceitful fisherman's tactics. You want to catch me with a hook, this is your shamelessness." 302/5. "O being! You were not deceived by the forty-two faults of *Aishana* in the consumption of heterogeneous food and water, therefore, now while consuming them, do not be deceived by attachment and aversion." 303. There are two types of *Bhaava Grassaishana* - *Prashasht* and *Aprashasht*. *Aprashasht* has five types, *Prashasht Bhaava Grassaishana* is devoid of these faults. 303/1. *Sanyojana*, excessive food, *Ingaladosha*, *Dhoomdosha* and eating without reason - these are the five *Aprashasht* types of *Grassaishana*, and the opposite of these, not doing *Sanyojana* etc., is *Prashasht*. 304, 305. There are two types of *Sanyojana* - *Dravya Sanyojana* and *Bhaava Sanyojana*. *Dravya Sanyojana* has two types - external and internal. To create a specific taste, combining milk, curd, soup, *Kattar-Timan* mixed ghee, *Bada*, *Gad*, ghee *Bada* and *Valank-Pakvaan* with special ingredients is external *Sanyojana*. Similarly, the combination done while eating in the *Upashraya* is internal *Sanyojana*. It is of three types - in the vessel, in the *Kaval* and in the mouth. Their explanation should be given.
1. For the expansion of the story, see *Pari. 3, Katha San. 50*. 2. For the five types of *Aprashasht Grassaishana*, see the translation of 303/1. 3. Mixing sugar in milk is external *Sanyojana*. 4. Combining two substances in the vessel due to the desire for taste is internal *Sanyojana* related to the vessel. Combining *Khand* etc. in the *Kaval* held in the hand is internal *Sanyojana* related to the *Kaval*, and putting bread first in the mouth and then adding jaggery etc. is internal *Sanyojana* related to the mouth (Mavri P. 172).

306. It is a transgression for a muni to mix other substances in their food for the purpose of increasing the taste of the substance. 307. A muni who combines substances due to their attachment to taste, also combines karma with their soul. This leads to a long-lasting cycle of births and deaths, causing suffering. 308. Once, a sadhu sanghatak received a large amount of ghee and other substances. Even after the munis ate their fill, some remained. It is permissible to combine the remaining substances for consumption. The rules for combining are as follows: 309. Combining for the purpose of enhancing a particular taste is prohibited. Combining for the purpose of overcoming illness is permissible. It is also permissible for those who find food unappetizing, or those who have been princes or have been deprived of proper education. 310. For a man, 32 kavals of food is considered sufficient for the stomach, while for women, 28 kavals are considered sufficient. 311. The Tirthankaras have called consuming a little less than this amount, such as one kaval, half a kaval, half the food, or even less than half the food, as "yatramaatra aahar" (just enough food) or "nyuna aahar" (less food). 312. A muni who consumes prakaam, nikaam, and pranit bhaktapaan, eats excessively or too frequently, is guilty of pramaanadosh (error in measure). 312/1. Food exceeding 32 kavals is called prakaam aahar. If the food exceeding the measure is:

1. Leftover ghee cannot be eaten with only roti without sugar or jaggery, as everyone will be satisfied after eating. It is also not appropriate to store it, as storing it can lead to the infestation of insects. Therefore, it is an exception to the rule of combining, and it is permissible to mix sugar or jaggery with the leftover ghee (Mavri P 173). 
2. According to the commentator Malayagiri, 32 kavals is the medium measure for food. The medium measure for women is 28 kavals, and for eunuchs, it is 24 kavals. However, eunuchs are ineligible for initiation, so they are not mentioned here. One kaval is considered to be the size of a chicken egg. There are two types of kukkuti: dravya kukkuti and bhav kukkuti. There are two types of dravya kukkuti: udar kukkuti and gal kukkuti. The amount of food that keeps the sadhu's stomach neither hungry nor overly full is udar kukkuti. The kaval that can fit inside the throat without distorting the mouth is gal kukkuti. The commentator explains from another perspective that the body itself is kukkuti and the mouth is the egg. The kaval that does not distort the eyes, eyebrows, etc., is the measure. Alternatively, the meaning of kukkuti is a bird, and the kaval is the size of its egg. The meaning of bhav kukkuti is the amount of food that maintains patience and increases knowledge, vision, and character (Mavri P. 173). In the commentary on Mulaachar, one kaval is considered to be the size of one thousand grains of rice (Mula 350 T P. 286).

**Translation**
The Tirthankaras have said that food which is eaten daily is *nikam* (useless) and food from which ghee etc. drips is *pranit aahar* (prescribed food).
312/2. Food eaten in *atibahuk* (excessive quantity), *atibahush* (excessive frequency) and *atipraman* (excessive measure) can cause diarrhea, vomiting and can even kill a person if the food is not digested.
201
312/3. Eating more than the prescribed quantity is *atibahuk* and eating more than three times a day is called *atibahush*. Eating more than the prescribed quantity more than three times a day or eating till one is not satisfied is called *atipraman aahar*.
313. The monks who eat *hitkari* (beneficial), *parimit* (limited) and *alpa-aahar* (less food) are not treated by physicians. They are their own physicians (i.e. they do not get sick).
313/1. The combination of oil and curd, milk, curd and *kanji* (fermented rice water) is *viruddha* (contradictory) and harmful. The combination of non-contradictory substances is *pathya* (beneficial), it removes disease and does not cause future disease.
313/2. Divide the stomach into six parts, keep half the stomach, i.e. three parts for food including dishes, two parts for water and the sixth part empty for the passage of air.
313/3, 4. One should know the three types of time - cold, hot and ordinary. The food intake for ordinary time is as follows: in extreme cold, one part water and four parts food, in moderate cold, two parts water and three parts food, in hot time, two parts water and three parts food, in extreme hot time, three parts water and two parts food - this is the measure. Everywhere, the sixth part is for the passage of air.
313/5. One part water and two parts food are fixed, they do not increase or decrease. In each, the remaining two parts increase or decrease, for example, in extreme cold, two parts of food increase and in extreme hot time, two parts of water increase. In extreme hot time, two parts of food decrease and in extreme cold, two parts of water decrease.
313/6. The third and fourth parts related to food are not fixed. The fifth part related to water,
1. Beneficial food is of two types - *dravyaatah* (in terms of substance) and *bhaavatah* (in terms of feeling). Eating non-contradictory food is beneficial in terms of substance and eating *eshniya* (digestible) food is beneficial in terms of feeling (Mavri P. 174).
2. *Pramanopet aahar* is moderate food.
3. Eating less than 32 *kavals* (a unit of measurement for food) is *alpa-aahar* (less food).
4. Vegetables, sour fruits, *khali* (bran), *kaith* fruit, *karir* (a type of tree), curd and fish - these things should not be eaten with milk (Mavri P. 174).
5. According to *Mulaachar* 491, the stomach should be divided into four parts, half the part for food, i.e. two parts for food, the third part for water and the fourth part should be kept empty for the passage of air. The same is mentioned in the *Khilasthan* of the *Kashyap Samhita* of Ayurveda.

The sixth part concerning air and the first and second parts concerning food - these four parts exist.

**314.** Eating food while praising it in a state of unconsciousness is called *sa-angar* food, and eating food while criticizing it is called *sadhum* food.

**Pinḍaniryukti**

**314/1.** That which is burning fuel but has not yet become embers is called *sadhum*. The same fuel, when burnt and the smoke has gone out, is called *angar*.

**314/2.** Even if a muni eats food before it is time, if he does so while inflamed by the fire of attachment, he quickly burns up his *charitra* (conduct) like a glowing ember.

**314/3.** The burning fire of hatred, with the smoke of aversion, continues to burn until it has made the *charitra* (conduct) like embers.

**315.** Food eaten with attachment is *sa-angar*, and food eaten with hatred is *sadhum*. One should know the forty-six faults in the method of eating (15 in origin, 16 in production, 10 in consumption, and 5 in combination, etc.).

**316.** This is the teaching of the discourse: that the ascetic muni should eat food, for the sake of meditation and study, free from past embers (attachment) and free from past smoke (hatred).

**317.** A muni, even while eating, practices dharma for six reasons, and even while abstaining from food, practices dharma for six reasons.

**318.** These are the six reasons for eating: 1. To pacify the pain of hunger, 2. To perform *vaiyāvṛttya* (daily activities), 3. To cleanse the *īryāpath* (path of conduct), 4. For the sake of *preksha* (contemplation) and other restraints, 5. To sustain life, and 6. To reflect on scriptures, contemplate dharma, and increase dharma.

**318/1.** There is no pain like hunger, therefore one should eat to pacify it. A hungry person is not capable of performing *vaiyāvṛttya*, therefore one should eat.

**318/2.** A hungry person cannot cleanse the *īryāpath*, therefore one should eat to cleanse the *īryāpath*. One should eat for the sake of *preksha* and other restraints. If one does not eat, the body becomes weak, therefore one should eat (to sustain life). If one does not eat, one becomes incapable of reflecting on scriptures, contemplating dharma, and performing *anupreksha* (reflection), therefore one should eat.

**1.** In the 16 faults of origin, the inclusion of *adhyavapūraka* (supplementary) in *miśrajāta* (mixed) results in only 15 faults of origin being considered here (Māvṛ P. 176).

319. A Muni may abandon food for six reasons. After completing all his duties, a Muni, in his final stage (by emaciating himself in Sanlekhana), may abstain from food, making himself fit for fasting. 320. These are the six reasons for abandoning food: 1. To prevent fear and disease, 2. To endure the Upasargas (attacks), 3. To uphold the secrets of Brahmacharya, 4. Out of compassion for living beings, 5. For the sake of austerity, and 6. For the shedding of the body. 320/1, 2. A Muni remains without food in the face of fear like fever, attacks by kings and relatives, to uphold Brahmacharya, out of compassion for living beings in rain and dew, for fasting up to the six-month austerity, and for the shedding of the body. 321. A monk who abandons food for these six reasons does not transgress it while being engaged in Dharma-Dhyana. 322. Sixteen faults of Udgama, sixteen faults of production, ten faults of Eshana, and five faults of the combination of Grasaishana, etc. - these are the 47 faults of Eshana. 323. This dietary regimen has been established by all-seeing Tirthankaras, and I have explained it according to my understanding. A Muni should follow it in such a way that there is no harm to Dharma and essential (Pratikramana, etc.) practices. 324. If a Muni is diligent, fully aware of the observance of the Sutra-prescribed method, and endowed with spiritual purification, any violation (slip-up due to consuming exceptions) he may commit will also be fruitless.

Appendix-3
Stories
1. Research: The Antelope Example
In the city of Kshitipratisthita, King Jitashatru ruled. His queen's name was Sudarshana. Once, the pregnant queen entered the picture hall with the king. There, she saw golden-backed antelopes painted in the pictures and developed a craving to eat their meat. When her craving was not fulfilled, her body gradually became weak. Seeing this, the king asked with regret, "Beloved! Why is your body becoming so weak every day?" The queen told the king about her craving. The king immediately sent royal men to bring golden-backed antelopes. The royal men thought to themselves that whoever is dear to someone, becomes attached to them and indulges in that pleasure carelessly. Golden-backed antelopes are fond of Shriparni fruits. Although they are not available at this time, if we make modaks similar to Shriparni fruits and place them in large quantities under the Shriparni tree and spread a net, they will be attracted. They did the same. The golden-backed antelopes, wandering with their leader, came there. Seeing the many modaks shaped like Shriparni fruits, the leader said to the antelopes, "A cunning person has spread this net here to trap you. Shriparni fruits do not bear fruit in this season. Even if they do, they are not in such large quantities. If it is assumed that the wind caused so many fruits to fall down, it is also not possible because the wind was blowing before also but so many fruits never fell. Therefore, it appears that this net has been laid for our bondage. You people should not go near these fruits." The antelopes who accepted the leader's words lived long and happily. Due to the greed for food, the antelopes who did not accept his words were caught in the net and became unhappy. 2. Research: The Elephant Example
In the city of Anandapur, King Ripumardan ruled. His queen's name was Dharini. Near his city, there was a forest in the valley of the Vindhya mountain, which had hundreds of elephants. Once, the king thought that elephant power is the greatest power of a king, so he encouraged his people to capture elephants. The royal men thought that elephants like nalchari but it is available in the rainy season. It is not possible in the summer. At this time, the pond should be filled with water from the arghatta-water extracting wheel, so that nalvan vegetation will grow in abundance. They did the same. Nets were spread all around near the nalvan. Wandering here and there, the elephants came there with their leader. Seeing those nalvans, the leader warned the elephants, "This nalvan vegetation

These are not natural. It is possible that some cunning person has laid this trap for the bondage of people. In addition, ponds always fill up during the rainy season, not in the summer. If someone says that the lake is filled by the flow of the waterfall of the Vindhya mountain and the Nalvana has sprouted, then this is also not logical because there were many waterfalls before, but the lake was never filled with so much water. Those elephants who followed the words of the leader of the herd, they roamed happily in the forest for a long time, but those who did not follow, they became bound and became unhappy. 

### 3. Origin: Laddupriyakumar Story

The king of the city named Shristhalak was named Bhanu. His queen's name was Rukmini and his son's name was Surup. The prince was being raised happily by five nurses. Like the gods, the Naga prince brought joy to many relatives and attained the age of childhood. Growing with many arts like the phases of the moon in the bright fortnight, pleasing the minds of beautiful women, the prince attained the age of youth. He was very fond of sweets, hence he was known in the world as 'Modakpriya'.

One day, in the spring, the prince got up from his bedroom and went to the assembly hall. There was a beautiful dance and other programs. When it was time for food, his mother sent him sweets. He ate sweets freely with his family. Due to staying awake at night because of songs and dances, the sweets did not digest. Due to indigestion, his apan vayu became polluted. The stench reached his nose. The prince thought that these sweets are made of ghee, jaggery, and flour. These three substances are pure, but they become impure by contact with the body. Camphor and other fragrant substances also become foul-smelling in a moment by contact with the body. For this body, which is full of such impurities and many defects, those who consume sinful deeds are like unconscious people even though they are conscious due to the sleep of delusion. Scholarship is only commendable when it contemplates the despicable and the desirable, the harmful and the beneficial. Those people are blessed who, being free from the body, immerse themselves in the ocean of nectar of knowledge through the study of the right scriptures, remain equal towards enemies and friends, conquer trials, and strive for the eradication of karma. The prince thought while contemplating that I will also follow the path shown by great people. Thus, with the emergence of detachment in the mind of that Modakpriya prince, knowledge, vision, and character emerged and he attained liberation.

### 4. Counter-Example: The Thief Story

There were many robbers in a village. Once they stole cows from a settlement and brought them to their village.

They set out to Pindanuyukti. On the way, they met other robbers. They also started walking with them. As they walked, they reached near their village. Upon reaching the village boundary, they became fearless. At mealtime, they started cooking the meat of some cows they had killed. Meanwhile, some other travelers also arrived there. The robbers invited them to eat as well. When the beef was cooked, some robbers and travelers started eating it. Thinking that eating beef is a great sin, some travelers did not eat that food. They only served others. Meanwhile, some royal officials arrived there with swords in their hands. They caught those who were eating with the thieves and those who were serving them. The royal officials told the travelers who said that they had met on the way and were not thieves, that they were serving beef and therefore were criminals like thieves. They were all sentenced to death. 5. Pratiśravana: The Prince-Example
In the city of Gunasamruddha, King Mahabala ruled. His queen's name was Sheila. His eldest son's name was Vijitsamar. To take over the kingdom, he started thinking wrongly about his father - 'This father of mine is not attaining death even though he is old, it seems he will be long-lived. I will kill him with the help of my soldiers and sit on the throne.' He started consulting with his soldiers. Some of the soldiers said - 'Prince! We will help you.' Others said - 'It would be good if you act this way.' Some soldiers remained silent at that time. Some soldiers did not like this, so they informed the king of the whole situation. The king put the eldest prince in the fire along with the soldiers who helped, those who gave suggestions and those who remained silent. The soldiers who came and informed him about this were honored. 6. Sanvas: The Palli-Example
In the city of Basantpur, there was King Arimaardan and Queen Priyadarshana. Near Basantpur, there was a village called Bhima, where many Bhil robbers and merchants lived. These robbers always used to come out of their village and create disturbances in the city of King Arimaardan. None of the king's samants and mandaliks could subdue them. Hearing about the disturbances in the city, the king, filled with anger, went towards the village of the Bhil robbers with resources and materials. The Bhils came forward and got ready for war. Due to the strong army, the king, excited, started defeating and killing them all. Some of them died and some fled from there. The king angrily took possession of that village. The merchants living there thought that we are not thieves, so what can the king do to us? Thinking this, they

233. They did not flee from there. The king also imprisoned them. The merchants pleaded with the king, "We are Vaniks (merchants), not thieves." Hearing their words, the king said, "You are even more criminal than thieves, because you live with the criminals who commit crimes."  The king punished all those merchants.

7. Anumodana: Rajadushta-dristanta
In the city named Srinilaya, there was a king named Gunachandra. His queen's name was Gunavati. In that city, there lived a merchant named Surup. His body was more beautiful than Kamadeva (the god of love). Beautiful women constantly desired him. He was attached to other women's wives. Once, he was passing by the king's inner palace. The queens of the inner palace looked at him with passionate eyes. He also looked at them with the same gaze. They developed mutual attachment. Through a messenger, he started enjoying intimacy with them daily. This news reached the king. When he reached the inner palace, the king's men caught him. He was adorned with the same ornaments with which he had entered the inner palace, and was publicly beaten to death at the city's crossroads. Seeing the destruction of his inner palace, the king became very sorrowful. Even after killing him, the king's anger did not subside. He summoned his messengers and said, "Go to the city and find out who is praising that wicked person and who is condemning him. Inform me of both." The king's men, disguised as commoners, started roaming the entire city. Some people were saying, "Every person who is born, dies. We are unfortunate because the queens of the inner palace never come into our sight, but that person is fortunate, who enjoyed his pleasure for a long time and then died." Others started saying, "This person is worthy of condemnation, unfortunate, who has acted against both the worlds. The king's queens are like mothers. How can the one who enjoyed intimacy with them be worthy of praise by the wise?"
The king's men presented both types of people before the king. Considering those who condemned him as wise, the king honored them, and threw those who praised him into the jaws of death.

8. Aadhakarm: Shalyodana-dristanta
In the village named Sankula, there lived a Shravaka (Jain lay follower) named Jinadatta. His wife's name was Jinamati. In that village, Kodrava and Ralaka grains were grown in large quantities. The ascetics also used to take their food there. The village's Upashray (Jain residential hall) was devoid of women, animals, and eunuchs, and was extremely pleasant. Swadhyaya (self-study) also took place there uninterruptedly. In that village, there was no Shalyodana (rice cooked with vegetables), so no Acharya (Jain preceptor) used to stay there.

234
One day, the Acharya arrived at a village called Bhadrail near Sankul village. He sent the sadhus to Sankul village for area transcription. The sadhus went to the Shravak Jindatt and requested accommodation. Jindatt happily granted them permission to stay in a suitable accommodation. The sadhus transcribed the land and the entire village. Upon returning to the shelter, Shravak Jindatt asked the senior sadhu, "Did you like this area? Can the Acharya visit this area?" The senior sadhu replied, "Vartmanyogena." From his answer, Jindatt understood that they did not like the area. Jindatt thought that other sadhus also come here but no one stays here, the reason for this is still unknown. To know the root cause, he asked another sadhu. He simply explained everything and said, "This area has all the qualities, this area is worthy of the Gachchha, but there is no Shalyodana worthy of the Acharya here." Knowing this, Shravak Jindatt brought Shali-seeds from another village and sowed them in his village. There was abundant production of Shali there.
Once, while traveling, some other sadhus also came to that village along with those sadhus. Shravak Jindatt thought, "I should give these sadhus Shalyodana as alms, so that these sadhus, considering this area worthy of the Acharya, will also bring the Acharya to this area. If I give Shalyodana only from my house and other houses get Kodrava etc. grains, then the sadhus will have doubts about Adhakarma." He sent Shalyodana to the homes of all his relatives and said, "You cook and eat Shalyodana yourself and also donate it to the sadhus." This matter became known to all the children as well. When the sadhus went for alms, they heard many things from the mouths of the children. One child said, "These are the sadhus for whom Shalyodana is made at home." Another child said, "My mother gave me Shalyodana related to the sadhus." Somewhere, a donor Shravika said, "This is given Shalyodana, now take alms from my house too." Some householder said to his wife, "Shalyodana has been given in alms, now give alms of your own cooked food too." Some ignorant child started saying to his mother, "Give me Shalyodana related to the sadhus." The poor person said with joy, "Even though we lack devotion, Shali devotion has been made. This has happened at the right time." Somewhere, a child said to his mother, "Mother! Give Shali Tandulodak to the sadhus." Another child
1. Here, the commentator has mentioned a worldly example to explain "Thhakke Thhakkaavadiyan" - being appropriate for the occasion - in the middle of the story: In a village called Sur, there lived a Gwalin named Yashodhara. Her husband's name was Yogaraj and her brother-in-law's name was Vatsaraj. His wife's name was Yodhani. Once, for some reason, Yodhani and Yogaraj died together. Then Yashodhara said to her brother-in-law Vatsaraj, "I want to become your wife." The brother-in-law thought that I also don't have a wife, so he accepted his sister-in-law's suggestion. Yashodhara thought, "Oh! The work has become appropriate for the occasion. At the time of my husband's death, my brother-in-law's wife also died. For this reason, the brother-in-law accepted me as his wife, otherwise he would not have accepted my words." (Ga. 76/4 Vr. P. 64).

The daughter-in-law removed the anklets. The son said, 'I was the only one in the Ashoka garden.' The elderly father said, 'I can say with certainty that there was another man with her at night.' Meanwhile, the daughter-in-law came and said in a loud voice, 'Until my purity is restored, I will not accept the bhakta-pana.'

Hearing the commotion, people gathered. She said, 'I will purify myself by taking the divine test.' The elderly citizens said, 'Undergo the test in front of the Yaksha in the temple.' After bathing and performing rituals, she reached there with the citizens. The king and others were also present. Meanwhile, a paramour named Sudarshana, disguised as a madman, came there wearing tattered clothes. He embraced the people and forcibly embraced the daughter-in-law. Addressing the guardians, he said, 'If I have not even thought of any man other than the one my parents married me to, and this possessed man, then I will safely pass through the Yaksha.'

Hearing this, the Yaksha was perplexed. She quickly passed through the Yaksha's idol. People cheered for her. Everyone started cursing the elder. The Yaksha thought, 'She has also deceived me.'

Despite being truthful, the elder was proven to be a liar. This worry kept the elder awake. He was appointed as the gatekeeper of the queens' chambers. When the first watch of the night passed, all the queens fell asleep, but one queen could not sleep. The elder pretended to sleep. The queen went to the mahout using the elephant's trunk. Due to the delay, the mahout angrily struck her with an iron chain. The queen said, 'Don't be angry. There is an old man appointed in the palace who has been sleeping for a long time.' In the morning, she went back to the palace on the elephant. The elder thought, 'If even the pure wives of the king can behave in such a contrary manner, then there is nothing surprising in what my daughter-in-law did.'

Thinking this, he became free from worry and fell into a deep sleep. Even at sunrise, he did not wake up. The complaint reached the king. The king summoned him, but the elder said, 'Don't wake me up.' On the seventh day, when his sleep was broken, the king asked, 'What is the matter?' Then he told the king the whole story and said that he did not know that queen.

The king had a clay elephant made. All the queens crossed the elephant. One queen said, 'I am afraid of the clay elephant.' Suspecting her, the king struck her with a lotus stalk. She fainted and fell to the ground. Marks of the iron chain blows on her back were visible. The king said, 'You were not afraid of the mad elephant, nor did you faint when struck with the chain, but you fainted when I struck you with the lotus stalk.' The king realized that she was a wanton woman. The king immediately ordered that the queen, the mahout, and the elephant - all three are worthy of execution. The executioner took them to the mountain and killed them.

The people told the king...

### 237. The Elephant and the King

It was requested that the poor elephant was a *tiryanch* (animal). What does it know? Therefore, don't kill it. But the king did not accept their plea. He painfully lifted the next two legs. Even after pleading, the king did not revoke his order. When three legs were lifted, people started discussing that the king was killing an innocent elephant. When the anger subsided, the king said, "Are you able to put the elephant's legs back on the ground?" The mahout said, "If you grant us *abhayadan* (protection), I can bring the elephant back to its original position." The king granted them *abhayadan*. The mahout, through the *ankush* (goad), brought the elephant back to its original position. The king, along with the queen, banished the mahout.

Concluding this story, the commentator Malayagiri says that when one leg is lifted on a broken *tank* (platform), the elephant can put that leg back down with a little effort. Similarly, when a *muni* (Jain monk) commits a minor transgression, he can return to *sanjam* (self-control) with a little purification. When two more legs are lifted, the elephant painfully brings its legs back to their original position. Similarly, a *sadhu* (Jain ascetic) can purify himself with a specific good resolve when he commits a *vyatikram* (major transgression). Just as an elephant, with three legs lifted and standing on one leg, can painfully return itself to its previous position, similarly, a *muni* can purify himself with a more specific good resolve when he commits an *atichaar* (grave transgression). Just as that elephant, with all four legs in the air, is unable to return them, it inevitably falls to the ground and perishes. Similarly, a *sadhu*, remaining in *anaachar* (unrighteous conduct), inevitably destroys his *sanjam* (self-control) soul. The commentator says that in the story, the elephant did not lift all four legs, but in *dartantik* (future), based on the possibility, the plan of *anaachar* is made.

### 11. The Ineligibility of *Adhakarm* (Half-Action): The Vomit Example

In the city of Vakrapur, there lived a soldier named Ugratej. His wife's name was Rukmini. Once, Ugratej's elder brother, Soudas, came from a nearby village as a guest. Ugratej brought meat for food and gave it to Rukmini to cook. Due to being busy with household chores, she ate the meat by mistake. Meanwhile, it was time for Soudas and Ugratej to eat, and she became anxious. In the meantime, a dog, having eaten the flesh of a dead *karpatik* (animal), vomited in the courtyard of her house due to *vayu-sankshhob* (wind disturbance). Rukmini thought, "If I go to a shop and buy meat, it will take a long time. It's time for my husband and brother-in-law to eat, so I will wash this vomited meat well and season it with spices." She did just that.

1. See *Ga. 82/2 Vr. P. 68* and *Dharmopadeśamālā* pp. 46-52.
2. This story is translated in brief from the *Dharmopadeśamālā* text because the commentator has mentioned, "The story of *Nupurpanditaya* is very famous and long, so it is not written here, but it can be understood from the explanation of *Dharmopadeśamālā*." The story continues further there, but only this much is relevant here, so the rest of the story is not translated.

Saudas and Ugra tej were present for the meal. He served them both the meat. Ugra tej, by the special smell, knew that it was vomit meat. He frowned and asked Rukmini about the meat. Seeing the angry frown, she trembled like a branch of a tree and told the truth. Throwing away that meat, she cooked another meat, then both of them ate. 12. Aavidhiparihara: Sadhu-Drishtant
In the village called Shali, there lived a merchant named Gramani. His wife's name was also Gramani. Once, when the merchant went to his shop, a sadhu came to his house for alms while wandering. Gramani brought Shalyodana. The sadhu asked about it, fearing the possibility of Adhakarma dosha - "Shravike! Where did this Shali come from?" Gramani said - "I don't know anything about it, the merchant knows, so ask him." The sadhu left the Shalyodana and went to the merchant's shop and asked him about the Shali. The merchant said - "This Shali has come from Gobar Gram, which is very far away in the Magadh Janpad." That sadhu was ready to go there. The sadhu thought that maybe this path was also made by some Shravak for the sadhu, so fearing Adhakarma, he left the original path and started going on the wrong path. Going on the wrong path, he had to endure the troubles of snakes, thorns and wild animals. Fearing Adhakarma, he avoided even the shade of the tree and walked. Overheated by the sun's heat, he fainted on the way and suffered great pain. 13. Adhakarma in Parinat: Sanghbhojya-Drishtant
In the city called Shatmukha, there lived a Shreshthi named Gunachandra. His wife's name was Chandrika. The Shreshthi was devoted to Jin-Pravachan. He had a Jinmandir built, which was comparable to the Himalayas, and installed the idol of Adinath in it. He organized a Sangh-bhoj on that occasion. In the nearby village, there lived a sadhu who was pretending to be a sadhu. He heard from the people that Gunachandra, a Shreshthi in Shatmukha city, is giving a Sangh-bhoj today. He came to that village quickly to get the Sangh-bhoj. His wife had given away all the Sanghbhakta. The sadhu begged the Shreshthi for Sanghbhakta. The Seth told Chandrika - "Give the sadhu food." Chandrika said - "I have given away all the food, 
1. Ga. 86 7. Pa. 71, Pimprati Pa. 19, there is also a difference of opinion in this story. The commentator Malayagiri has also indicated the story with a difference of opinion. According to him, in Rukmini's house, a Karpatik named Dusprabh, suffering from diarrhea, asked for a secluded place. Due to diarrhea, he excreted pieces of meat. When the cat ate the meat, the husband and the elder brother were present at the time of the meal, and when no other meat was available, she, out of fear, took the pieces of meat that were discarded in the diarrhea, washed them with water, and cooked them with spices, etc., and served them to both of them when the time for the meal came. At that time, Gunamitra, the son of the deceased wife, held the hands of his father and father-in-law and stopped them from eating, telling them the whole story. Ugra tej rebuked his wife and avoided that meat (Ga. 86/1 and Pa. 71). 2. Ga. 89/1-3 Vr Pa. 72, 73.

'Nothing is left now.' The Seth said, 'Give the monk alms from your food.' Then he gave alms of *shalyodana*, *modaka*, etc. The monk, with the mind of a devotee of the Sangha, accepted it and went to the *upaashraya* and ate it. Even though he consumed pure food, due to the consequences of the *aadharmik* consumption, he bound himself with *aadharmik* *bhog* generated karmas.

**14. Method of Avoidance: The Priyankar Kshapak Example**

The Acharya named Ratnakar, accompanied by 500 monks, arrived in the city of Potanpur. Among those monks was a devout monk named Priyankar. He would perform austerities for a month and then break his fast. Fearing that someone might prepare *aadharmik* food for his fast-breaking meal, he went to a nearby village to beg for alms. There lived a *shravaka* named Yashomati. She had heard about the monk's month-long fast and his upcoming fast-breaking meal. She thought, 'Perhaps this monk will come to my house for alms.' So, with utmost devotion, she prepared a special *shali-tandul* kheer. She infused it with ghee, jaggery, and other ingredients that enhance strength. Thinking, 'Kheer is a superior substance,' she wanted to ensure the monk wouldn't have any doubts about *aadharmik* food. So, with cunning, she put small portions of kheer in *shrava* shaped vessels made of leaves of banyan trees, suitable for children. She told the children, 'When a monk like this comes here, you tell him, "Oh mother, you have served us too much kheer, we cannot eat it." If you say this, I will scold you. Then you say, "Why do you make kheer every day?"' Having instructed the children in this way, the monk arrived at her house first for alms. Seeing the monk, she was overjoyed, but to avoid any suspicion in the monk's mind, she remained composed and didn't show excessive respect. The children also spoke as instructed. She reprimanded the children. She said to the monk, 'What kind of foolish children are these, who don't even find kheer appealing? If you like kheer, eat it, otherwise move on.' Hearing this, the monk was reassured and prepared to eat the kheer. She, with utmost devotion, filled the vessel with kheer, ghee, and jaggery. The monk, free from any doubts about *aadharmik* food, consumed the kheer with pure intention and went to sit under a tree. There, he performed the *iryaapath* ritual, performed *pratikraman*, and thought, 'Today, I have received the superior substance kheer, along with ghee, jaggery, etc. If any monk comes and shares it with me, I will be saved from the ocean of the world. Because monks are constantly immersed in *swadhyay*, they are detached from the world and engrossed in the path of liberation, they are devoted to the service of their guru, *shaiksha*, etc., they are inclined towards *paropadesh*, and they are engaged in the practice of *sanjam*. By sharing with them, I will benefit from their knowledge, etc. This body is worthless and useless.'

After consuming food with a pure and unwavering determination, free from bodily fainting, one attains liberation.

## 15. The Adoration and Violation of Command: The Two Garden Example

In the city of Chandranana, King Chandravatansak ruled. He had many wives, including Trilokerakha. The king had two gardens: one in the east, named Suryoday, and the other in the west, named Chandrodya. One day, during the spring season, the king announced a celebration with his inner court, ordering the drums to be beaten. "In the morning, the king will be in the Suryoday garden with his inner court, so no citizens should go there. All grass-cutters and wood-cutters should go to the Chandrodya garden." After the drums were beaten, the king appointed soldiers to guard the Suryoday garden and ordered that no one should enter.

At night, the king thought, "In the morning, when I go to the Suryoday garden, the sun will be in front of me, and when I return, it will be noon, and the sun will still be in front of me. The rays of the sun are painful, so I will go to the Chandrodya garden." He decided to do so.

After hearing the drums, some wicked people thought, "We have never seen the king's inner court. In the morning, the king will come to the Suryoday garden with his inner court and enjoy themselves. We will hide in the branches of a leafy tree so that no one can see us. This way, we can see the king's inner court." They did just that. The garden guards saw them hiding in the branches of the tree. They caught them, beat them with sticks, and tied them with ropes.

The other grass-cutters all went to the Chandrodya garden. They enjoyed themselves and saw the king's inner court wives. The royal guards caught them too.

As the king was leaving the garden and entering the city, the garden keepers presented both groups of people to him and told him the whole story. Those who had violated the order did not get to see the inner court, and they were punished. Those who went to the Chandrodya garden had obeyed the order, so even though they saw the inner court, they were released.

## 16. Non-Attachment: The Cow-Calf Example

In the city of Gunalaya, a wealthy merchant named Sagardatta lived with his wife, Shrimati. The merchant demolished an old, dilapidated temple and built a magnificent new one. He had four sons: 1. Gunachandra, 2. Gunasen, 3. Gunachud, and 4. Gunashekhara. Their wives were: 1. Priyangulatika, 2. Priyanguruchaka, 3. Priyangusundari, and 4. Priyangusarika. As time passed, the merchant's wife...

Chapter 3: Stories

241. The wife of the wealthy man passed away. The wealthy man entrusted the responsibility of the entire household to his eldest daughter-in-law, Priyangulatika. The wealthy man had a cow with a calf in his house. The cow would go out to graze during the day. The calf would remain tied up at home. All four daughters-in-law would give the calf fodder and water on time.

One day, there was a wedding of Gunasagar, the son of Gunachandra and Priyangulatika. On that day, all the daughters-in-law were busy adorning themselves with ornaments and applying cosmetics. All four daughters-in-law forgot to feed the calf. No one gave it fodder or water. At noon, the wealthy man went to the calf. The calf also started crying upon seeing the wealthy man coming. Seeing the calf crying, the wealthy man understood that it was still hungry. He rebuked all the daughters-in-law in anger. Hearing the wealthy man's words, Priyangulatika quickly went to the calf with appropriate fodder and water. The calf did not look at the decorated house, nor did it look at the daughters-in-law adorned like celestial beings with lustful eyes. Its gaze was only on the fodder and water. 17. Dravya-puti: The Cow Dung Example

Outside the city of Samilla, there was a Yaksha named Manibhadra in a garden. One day, a disease called Sheetalaka was born in that city. Then some people thought that if we survive this disease, we will celebrate the Ashtami and other festivals for a year. All the people of the city survived that disease. It was decided in their minds that this was all the miracle of the Yaksha. Then, appointing a person named Devasharma as a priest for a salary, the people said, "You have to plaster the Yaksha assembly with cow dung every morning on Ashtami and other days for a year. We will come and celebrate in that clean and holy place." Devasharma agreed to this.

One day, he went to a family's house to get cow dung before sunrise to plaster the assembly for the celebration. There, a worker had indigestion from drinking mandak, vall, and sura at night. In the west night, he had discharged the foul-smelling indigestion in the cow shed. A buffalo came and defecated on top of it. The foul-smelling excrement was covered by the cow dung on top, so Devasharma did not know in the darkness. He took the cow dung along with the excrement and plastered the assembly with it. The people who were going to celebrate came there with various food items. They started smelling a very foul smell there. They asked Devasharma where this impure smell was coming from. He said, "I don't know." They looked carefully at the courtyard of the assembly and saw the parts of vall, etc., and also smelled the smell of wine. They realized that there was excrement in the middle of the cow dung. All the people left the food.

The pinda was discarded as impure. The courtyard plaster was completely removed and the assembly hall was plastered again with fresh cow dung. Food was also cooked afresh and eaten.

## 18. Kritakritadosha: Mankh-Dristant
In the village of Shaligram, there lived a Mankh named Devsharma. In his house, some Sadhus stayed for the rainy season. Seeing the Sadhus' selfless conduct, free from attachment and aversion, he became a great devotee of theirs. He would invite them daily for food and other necessities. The Sadhus always refused, considering it as a Shayyatar Pind. The Mankh thought, "These Sadhus do not accept food or anything else from my house. Even if I offer them alms elsewhere, they will not accept. Therefore, when they leave after their stay, I will go ahead and offer them alms in any way possible." With a few days remaining for the rainy season, he asked the Sadhus, "After Chaturmas, in which direction will you go?" The Sadhus readily replied that they would go in a particular direction. The Mankh went to a Gokul in that direction, showed his Pat, and started attracting people with his eloquence. People started giving him ghee, milk, etc. The Mankh said, "When I ask you, you will give me ghee, milk, etc."

After Chaturmas, the Sadhus started wandering from village to village. The Mankh, without revealing himself, requested milk, ghee, etc., from the previously forbidden houses and collected them in one house. He invited the Sadhus. Due to his disguise, the Sadhus could not recognize him. Considering it pure food, they accepted the milk, ghee, etc. Thus, even while accepting Krit Ahar, the Sadhus did not become guilty because they had followed the Lord's command to the best of their ability.

## 19. Laukik Pramitya: Bhagini-Dristant
In a village in the Kaushal Janpad, there lived a Kautumbik named Devraj. His wife's name was Sarika. He had many sons like Sammat and many daughters like Sammati. The entire family was very religious. In the same village, there lived a Shreshthi named Shivdev and his wife Shiva. Once, an Acharya named Samudraghosh came to their village. Hearing the Dharma preached by the Acharya, Sammat developed dispassion and took Diksha. Over time, by the grace of the Guru, he became a Bahushrut. Once, a thought arose in his mind, "If any of my relatives take Diksha, it would be good. This is the real benefit, to liberate a person from the ocean of Samsara." Thinking this, he asked his Guru and came to his brother's village. Outside the village, he asked an old man, "Do any members of the family of Devraj, the Kautumbik, live here?" The old man replied, "All members of that family have passed away, only Sammati, the widowed daughter, is alive." The Sadhu went to her house. Seeing her brother, she...

She was very happy in her mind. With reverence, devotion and worship, she presented herself to prepare food for them. The monk stopped her and said, "The food prepared for us is inconceivable."
Due to poverty, she could not obtain oil anywhere during the begging time. Finally, she borrowed two palikas of oil from a merchant named Shivadev, on the basis of double interest per day. The brother monk was not aware of this incident, so he accepted it as pure. That day, she was busy listening to the discourse from the brother monk, so she could not bring water etc. and pay the interest of two palikas of oil. The next day, the brother was going on a pilgrimage, so she could not fulfill the interest of the oil in his absence. On the third day, her debt became two karshas. Due to excessive debt, she was unable to repay it. She worked hard all day for food, but could not repay the debt. The debt became infinite due to the double increase. Then the merchant said with consent, "Either you give me my oil or accept my servitude." Unable to give the oil, she accepted the merchant's servitude.
After a few years, a monk named Sammat reached the same village while on pilgrimage. He did not see his sister at home. When his sister arrived, he asked her the reason for leaving home. The sister told her the whole story of the past and told her about her servitude to Shivadev the merchant and started crying due to sorrow. The monk said, "Don't cry, I will soon free you from servitude." Thinking of a way to free his sister from servitude, he first went to the house of Shivadev the merchant. His wife Shiva was about to wash her hands with water to give alms. The monk prevented her from washing her hands and said, "Washing hands does not make alms acceptable to us." The merchant sitting nearby said, "What is wrong with that?" Then the monk explained in detail about the six-fold transgression caused by washing hands. Hearing the monk's words, he respectfully asked, "O Bhagavan! Where is your abode? I will come to you and listen to the Dharma." The monk said, "My abode has not been fixed yet." Then the merchant gave the monk a place to stay in a corner of his house.
The merchant listened to the Dharma from the monk every day. The merchant accepted right faith and minor vows. One day, the monk described the vows taken by Vasudeva and other ancestors. The monk said that Vasudeva Krishna had accepted this vow that if any of his sons would take renunciation, he would not be an obstacle. Hearing this, Shivadev also took the vow, "If any member of my family takes initiation, I will not stop him." After some time, Shivadev's eldest son and the monk's sister Sammati became ready for initiation. The merchant allowed them to take initiation and they accepted renunciation.

##  244. The Example of Transferred Fault: The Case of the Rice

In the city of Basantpur, there lived a wealthy merchant named Nilaya. His wife was named Sudarshana, and they had two sons, Kshemankar and Devadatta, and a daughter named Lakshmi. In the same city, there lived a wealthy merchant named Tilaka, whose wife was named Sundari. They had a son named Dhanadatta and a daughter named Bandhumati. Kshemankar took the vows of a monk under the guidance of Samit Acharya. Devadatta married Bandhumati, and Dhanadatta married Lakshmi.

One day, due to the effects of his karma, Dhanadatta faced poverty. Because of his poverty, he often ate food made from kodrava grain. Devadatta was wealthy, so he always ate food made from shalyodana rice. One day, Kshemankar, the monk, was traveling from village to village, and he came to that city. He thought, "If I go to my brother Devadatta's house, my sister will think that I am avoiding her because of her poverty, and she will feel humiliated. She will feel sorry for herself." So, out of compassion, he went to her house. When the time for begging for food came, Lakshmi thought, "First, he is my brother, second, he is a monk, and third, he is a guest. We don't have shalyodana rice at home, only kodrava food, so how can I offer him alms?" She went to her sister-in-law, Bandhumati, and took some kodrava rice and made a meal.

Meanwhile, Devadatta came home for his meal. Not knowing about the change in food, he saw the kodrava meal and thought, "Bandhumati has been stingy today and didn't make shalyodana rice, instead, she made kodrava food." He started beating Bandhumati. She cried out, "Why are you beating me? Your sister took the shalyodana rice and left the kodrava." When Dhanadatta sat down to eat, Bandhumati served Kshemankar the monk with the remaining shalyodana rice after offering him alms. He asked, "Where did this shalyodana rice come from?" Hearing the whole story, Dhanadatta became angry and said, "You sinner! Why didn't you cook shalyodana rice at home and offer it to the monk? You have insulted me by asking for shalyodana rice from another house." He also beat Bandhumati. The monk heard the whole story from both families. At night, Kshemankar, the monk, explained to everyone, "This kind of transferred food is not acceptable to us. I accepted it unknowingly. The Lord has forbidden this kind of food because of the faults like conflict and so on." Kshemankar, the monk, explained the Jain principles in detail. Everyone felt detached from worldly desires. The monk initiated them all into the Jain faith.

## 21. The Example of the Sweetmeats: The Fault of Accepting Food Offered with a Hidden Fault

In a certain village, there lived many lay followers of Jainism, including Dhanavah and many lay women, including Dhanavati. They were all related to each other. One day, there was a wedding in their family. After the wedding, many sweetmeats were left over. They thought, "We should offer these sweetmeats to the monks as alms, so that we can gain great merit."

They would receive it. Some monks are far away, some are near, but there is a river in between. They will not come here for fear of violating the Apkay. Even if they do come, seeing the abundance of modaks, they will have doubts about Adhakarma, therefore they will not accept them. Therefore, they will take the modaks secretly to the village where the monks live. They did just that.

Upon arriving there, they again thought that if they called the monks, they would not accept them for fear of impurity, therefore they should also give some modaks to Brahmins, etc. If the monks do not see them giving to Brahmins, etc., they will have doubts about impurity. The monks go to the Panchami Samiti (for chanting, etc.) by a certain route, so they will see them giving on that route. Thinking this way, they began to give small amounts of modaks to the Dwijas, etc., outside a temple. The monks who had gone out for chanting, etc., saw them giving to the Brahmins. The Shravaks invited them, saying, "We have a lot of modaks left over, please accept them." The monks, knowing them to be pure, accepted the laddu. Those monks also told the other monks that there were abundant edible modaks, etc., at a certain place. Then they also went there to accept them. Some Shravaks gave them a lot of modaks, etc. Some, pretending, stopped them, saying, "Give them only this much, not more. The rest is for our food." Some Shravaks again stopped them, saying, "We have all eaten, so no one will eat. Give the monks as much as they want, even a little left over will do." The monks who had rejected Navkarasi ate the modaks. Those who had Porisi were eating, and those monks who had indigestion, etc., were waiting for the first part of the day. They had not eaten anything.

The Shravaks thought that by now all the monks must have eaten, so they should offer their respects and go back to their place. After more than an hour, the Shravaks went to the monk's shelter and performed all the actions of the Naishidhiki, etc., Shravaks. The monks knew that these Shravaks were very wise. During the conversation, the monks learned that they were residents of a certain village. After thinking, the monks concluded that they must have brought modaks from their village for us. Except for the monks who had eaten, those who were waiting for the first part of the day and those who were eating, gave their food in their hands to the bowl. Those who had put the food in their mouths did not swallow it, but took it out of their mouths and put it in the nearby Mallakapatra. All the food and modaks in the bowl were purified. The Shravaks and Shravikas apologized and went back to their village. Those who had eaten or half-eaten were also innocent due to Ashthabhav.

##  Pindaniyukti 22. Malaprahrit Dosha: The Bhikshu Dṛṣṭānta

In the city of Jayantpur, there lived a householder named Yakṣadatta. His wife's name was Vasumatī. Once, a monk named Dharmaruci entered their house seeking alms. Seeing the monk, who was restrained in his senses, free from attachment and aversion, and possessed of the qualities of a true seeker, Yakṣadatta felt a strong desire to give charity. He told his wife Vasumatī, "Give these monks some modakas." The modakas were kept in a pot in the middle of the upper floor. She got up to fetch them. Knowing that the alms were Malaprahrit, the monk left the house. Immediately, another monk entered the house seeking alms. Yakṣadatta asked him, "Why didn't that monk accept the alms that were taken from the upper floor?" The monk, motivated by envy, said, "These people have never given charity in their lives, so due to their past karma, they don't get the delicious and fragrant food of wealthy houses. They get food from poor houses, which is just enough to sustain them." Yakṣadatta told Vasumatī to give the monk some modakas. She got up to take the modakas from the pot on the upper floor. The smell of the modakas, made from the finest ingredients, attracted a snake, which came and sat near the pot. Vasumatī, standing on her toes, reached her hand inside the pot to take the modakas. The snake, like a lustful person, seized her hand. "Oh, I've been bitten by a snake!" she cried out, falling to the ground. Yakṣadatta, seeing the snake, scolded it. He immediately called for snake charmers who could remove the poison. Many kinds of medicines were brought. Due to her remaining life force, the effects of the mantras and medicines made her healthy again.

The next day, the same monk Dharmaruci came there seeking alms. Yakṣadatta, reproaching the monk, said, "Your religion is based on compassion, yet is it right for you to ignore the snake even after seeing it?" The monk said, "I didn't see the snake at that time. For us, the omniscient one has taught that a monk should not accept Malaprahrit alms, so I returned from your house." Yakṣadatta thought to himself, "The Lord has taught a faultless religion for the monks." Thinking this, Yakṣadatta respectfully bowed to Dharmaruci. After bowing, he asked him about the religion taught by the Jinas. The monk briefly explained the religion to him. He understood what was to be avoided and what was to be pursued. At noon, the couple went to the guru and listened to the teachings of the religion. They became detached and took initiation right there.

She was pregnant at the time, but accepting her husband's order like a deity, she began to climb up through the *nihsreni*. The Muni, considering *malaprahrit* alms unacceptable, left the house.

At that time, a *kapalik* entered the house seeking alms. Suradatta asked the *kapalik*, "Is it not considered unacceptable for the Muni to accept alms brought from the upper floor?" Driven by envy, the *kapalik* spoke incoherently. Suradatta ordered Vasundhara to give him sweets as well. While climbing the *nihsreni*, her foot slipped, and she fell down. Below, there was a mortar for pounding rice. The nail of the mortar pierced her stomach, splitting it in two. Her pulsating fetus emerged from her womb. Experiencing extreme pain from the splitting of her stomach by the nail, the child died in front of everyone. After a few moments, Vasundhara also passed away. The *kapalik* was condemned by all.

One day, the same Muni entered that house seeking alms. Suradatta said to the Muni, named Gunachandra, "You saw the destruction of the donor with your knowledge-eyes, and you avoided alms. Why didn't you tell us about this? If you had told us, she wouldn't have climbed to the upper floor at that time." The Muni said, "I know nothing about this. The teachings of the omniscient are for us Munis, that *malaprahrit* alms are not acceptable for a Muni." Suradatta listened to the Muni's Dharma and took *pravrajya*.

**24. The Fault of *Aachhedya*: The Example of the Cowherd**

In the city of Basantpur, there lived a Shravak named Jindas. His wife's name was Rukmini. In Jindas' house, there lived a cowherd named Vatsaraj. On the eighth day, he would take all the milk from the cows and buffaloes to his house, where he would make ghee. One day, a Muni came there seeking alms. That day was the cowherd's turn to take all the milk. He milked all the cows and buffaloes thoroughly. Jindas was very devoted to the teachings of the Jinas. Seeing the Muni approaching, he offered him food and drink with devotion. Thinking, "One should drink milk after eating," the Seth, with a devout mind, forcibly took some milk from the cowherd and gave it to the Muni. The cowherd felt a little resentment towards the Muni, but he couldn't say anything out of fear of his master. He took the milk pot home.

Seeing the partially empty milk pot, his wife angrily asked, "Why is the milk pot so empty today?" The cowherd told her everything truthfully. His wife also became angry at the Muni. Seeing the reduced amount of milk, their children started crying. Seeing his entire family distressed, the cowherd became very angry at the Muni. He left home to kill the Muni. He went to a place...

**Pindaniyukti**

A monk was seen begging for alms from a distance. A cowherd ran after him with a stick, intending to hit him. The monk turned around and saw the angry cowherd. He understood that the cowherd was coming to hit him because Jinadas had forcefully taken the milk and given it to him. The monk approached the cowherd with a cheerful face and said, "O cowherd! Your master willingly gave me this milk as alms. Now, take back your milk." 

The cowherd's anger subsided upon hearing this. He calmed down and said, "O monk! I came to hit you, but now, your words have calmed my anger. You can keep this milk. I will leave you today, but in the future, never consume food that is not properly offered." Saying this, the cowherd returned home, and the monk reached his shelter.

## 25. Anisrushta Dosha: Laddaka Drishtanta

In the city of Ratnapura, Mani Bhadra, a prominent person, lived with 32 companions. Once, they made ordinary sweets for a celebration and went to the celebration place as a group. They left one person there to guard the sweets. The remaining 31 companions went to bathe in the river. Meanwhile, a greedy monk arrived there seeking alms. He saw the sweets. Driven by greed, the monk requested the sweets from the man, offering him religious merit. The man replied, "These sweets are not solely mine; 31 others also share them. How can I give them alone?" Upon hearing this, the monk asked, "Where have they gone?" The man replied, "They have all gone to bathe in the river." Hearing this, the monk said again, "Can't you gain merit from the sweets of others? You are foolish! You are not earning merit by donating the sweets of others even when I ask for them. If you give me 32 sweets, you will still get one sweet. If you truly understand the principle of 'Alpa Vaya and Bahudana,' then give me all the sweets." 

Upon hearing this, the man gave all the sweets to the monk. The monk, filled with joy at having his bowl filled with sweets, left the place.

Meanwhile, Mani Bhadra and his companions came back. They asked the monk, "O venerable one! What did you receive here?" The monk thought, "If these are the owners of the sweets, they will take the sweets back from me if they hear about the sweets. Therefore, I will say that I received nothing." He said the same. Mani Bhadra and his companions, seeing the bowl filled with sweets, became suspicious. They said, "We want to see your bowl." The monk refused to show his bowl. Then, they forcefully...

**Note:** In Nishita Churni, there is a slight difference in the beginning of this story. A cowherd was responsible for dividing the milk and protecting the cows. He would take one-fourth of the milk from the cows that gave milk daily and would take all the milk from the cows on the fourth day. (Ga. 173/2, 3 Vr. P. 111, Nibha 4502 Chu. P. 433, Pimprati P. 47).

The Sadhu's character was seen. Then, with a furious eye, Koparun asked the Modak protector man, "How did you give all the Modaks to this Sadhu?" He trembled with fear and said, "I did not give him any Modaks." Hearing this, all the companions, including Manibhadra, said to the Sadhu, "You are a thief and a hypocrite who pretends to be a Sadhu. Where is your Moksha?" Saying this, they pulled the Sadhu's clothes. Then, taking all the vessels, Rajoharan, etc., they made him a householder and a "Pachchakad." They all took the Sadhu to the royal palace and told the Dharmadikari everything. He questioned the Sadhu about everything, but due to shame, he could not say anything. Then, those officers who were administering justice thought, "This is definitely a thief, but he is disguised as a Sadhu, so he should be exiled alive."

**26. Dhatridoṣa: Sangamasuri and Datt Story**

In the city of Kollakir, Sangam Acharya, being weak due to old age, was traveling. Once, due to famine, he made his disciple Singh the Acharya and sent him to a prosperous region. He himself stayed there alone. He divided the region into nine parts and diligently performed Masakalp and Chaturmas. After a year, Singh Acharya sent his disciple Datt to inquire about his Guru Sangam Acharya's condition. The Acharya was staying in the same residence where he had left him. Datt thought in his mind, "The Acharya has not performed the Masakalp with devotion, so I should not stay with someone who has lax conduct." Thinking this, he stayed in the pavilion outside the residence. He paid his respects to the Acharya and inquired about his well-being. Datt conveyed the message given by Singh to the Acharya. During the Bhikshavela, he went with the Acharya to beg for alms. After receiving alms from the houses at the end of the street, his face became pale. Then, knowing his feelings, the Acharya entered the house of a wealthy Seth. There, due to a Vyantari residing there, a child was always crying. The Acharya struck a pair of tongs and said, "Vats! Don't cry." When the Acharya said this, the Vyantari, influenced by his power, laughed and went away from there. The child stopped crying. The householder was very happy with this. He gave the Sadhu many Modaks as alms. Datt was happy to receive the Modaks. He went to his residence.

The Acharya was indifferent to his body, so he returned to the Upashraya after begging for alms in the houses at the end of the street, as per the Agamvidhi. During the Pratikramanvela, the Acharya said to his disciple Datt, "Vats! Criticize the Dhatripinda and Chikitsapinda." Datt said, "I went with you to beg for alms, so how can I be blamed for consuming the Dhatripinda?" The Acharya said, "Playing with the small child is Kridan Dhatripinda, and by striking the tongs, the child was freed from the Vyantari, this is Chikitsapinda." Then, with a hateful mind, Datt thought, "The Acharya himself does not perform Masakalp with devotion, and he takes such Pindas every day. I have taken one

"Even though I took food on the day of Pindanuyukti, they are still criticizing me." Thinking this way, he left the residence out of anger.

Seeing the anger towards the Acharya, a deva attracted to the Acharya's qualities darkened the residence to teach Datt and caused rain with strong wind. Frightened, he asked the Acharya, "Where should I go?" Then, with a very pure heart, the Acharya said, "Vats! Come inside the residence." Datt said, "I can't see the door because of the darkness." With compassion, the Acharya applied mucus and raised his finger. It ignited like a flame. Then, that wicked-minded Datt thought, "Oh! The Acharya also has fire as a possession." Thinking this way, the deva rebuked him, saying, "Oh, lowly disciple! You think this way about the Acharya who is full of all virtues." Then, the deva told the disciple the true story of obtaining the modak. The disciple's feelings changed. He apologized to the Acharya and criticized him properly. 27. Dooti Dosha: Dhanadatt Katha

Near the vast village was a village called Gokul. There lived a householder named Dhanadatt. His wife's name was Priyamati and his daughter's name was Devaki. In the same village, she was married to a young man named Sundar. His son's name was Balishth and his daughter's name was Revati. His daughter was married to Sangam in Gokul village. At a young age, Priyamati passed away. Dhanadatt also became detached from the world and took initiation, starting to wander with his guru. After some time, while wandering from village to village, Dhanadatt came to his daughter Devaki's village. At that time, there was a feud between the two villages. The residents of the vast village planned to attack Gokul village. Dhanadatt Muni went to Gokul village for alms, when Devaki, who was lying down, said, "You are going to Gokul village. Tell your granddaughter Revati that your mother has sent a message that this village will attack your village with a band of robbers in disguise, so take all your loved ones to a safe place in seclusion." The sage told Revati all this. She told her husband everything. He informed the whole village. The whole village, wearing armor, etc., got ready for war.

The next day, the robbers reached the vast village. The battle began between them. Sundar and Balishth went with the band of robbers. Sangam was in Gokul village. All three of them were killed in the battle. Hearing of the death of her husband, son, and son-in-law, Devaki began to lament. People came to console her. They said, "If the news of the robbers coming to Gokul village had not been given, they would not have been armed and ready for battle, nor would your husband, etc., have died. Which evil spirit sent the news to Gokul village?" People asked this

Hearing this, Devaki, filled with anger, said, "Due to lack of knowledge, I had sent a message to my daughter through the Muni." The Muni Dhanadatta started to be condemned in all the realms. Even his sermons were disregarded.

**28. The Fault of Nimitta: The Example of the Village Chief**

In a village, there lived a dejected Naimittika Sadhu. The village chief had gone on a pilgrimage, leaving his wife behind. The Naimittika, using his Nimitta knowledge, attracted the chief's wife. The chief, from a distant village, thought, "I will go in disguise and see if my wife is virtuous or unvirtuous." Knowing about the chief's arrival from the Naimittika Sadhu, the wife sent her relatives to meet him. The chief asked them, "How did you know about my arrival?" They replied, "Your wife told us." He pondered, "How did my wife know about my arrival?"

The Sadhu arrived at the house of the village chief's wife. He confidently told her about the conversation, actions, dreams, and the marks, tilak, etc., of her husband. Meanwhile, the village chief arrived home. He welcomed his wife properly. He asked, "How did you know about my arrival?" She replied, "I got the information through the Naimittika Sadhu's Nimitta knowledge." The chief asked, "Does he have any other trustworthy knowledge?" She then told him about the conversation, actions, etc., that she had with her husband, the dreams she had, and the tilak on her private parts, all of which the Naimittika Sadhu had accurately revealed. Filled with jealousy and anger, the chief asked the Sadhu, "What is in the belly of this mare?" The Sadhu replied, "A foal with Pancha-Pundra." The chief thought, "If this is true, then the marks, tilak, etc., that he told my wife about must also be true. Otherwise, he must be a fornicator who commits wrong deeds and deserves to be killed." Thinking this, he cut open the mare's belly. A pulsating Pancha-Pundra youth emerged. Seeing this, his anger subsided. He said to the Sadhu, "If this had not been true, you would not be alive in this world."

**29. The Fault of Treatment: The Example of the Lion**

In a forest, a tiger became blind. Due to blindness, it became difficult for him to find prey. A physician cured his blindness. Upon regaining his health, the tiger first killed the physician and then started killing other animals in the forest.

**Pindaniyukti 30. Krodha Pind: Kshapaka Dristant**

In the city of Hastakalp, a Brahmin's house was hosting a death feast. A sadhu, who had performed a tapasya of one month without eating, arrived there to break his fast. He saw the Brahmins giving away ghevar as charity. The sadhu was stopped by the gatekeeper. The sadhu became angry and said, "If you don't give it today, then you will have to give it to me next month." Saying this, he left the house. By divine will, another person from that house died after five or six days. On the day of his death feast, the same sadhu arrived there to break his fast. That day too, the gatekeeper stopped him. The muni became angry and again said, "If not today, then you will have to give it to me sometime." Hearing this, the senior gatekeeper thought, "This sadhu has cursed like this twice before. Two people from the house have died. This is the third time. Now, no one else from the house should die." So, he told the head of the household everything. The head of the household apologized to the sadhu respectfully and gave him ghevar and other things as alms. (This is Krodha Pind).

**31. Shvetangali**

In a village, a man was completely under the control of his wife. Every morning, he would ask his wife for food because of hunger. She would say, "I am too lazy to get up so early, so you yourself take out the ashes from the stove, bring fire from the neighbor's house, light the stove, and cook food. When it is cooked, I will serve you and you can eat." Every day, he would do this as his wife said. Because of taking out the ashes from the stove every morning, his face would become white with ashes. So, people jokingly started calling him Shvetangali.

**32. Bakoddayak**

In a village, a man was very attached to the pleasure of seeing his wife's face. So, he was obedient to her every command. Once, his wife said, "I am feeling lazy today, so you go to the pond yourself and bring water." He accepted his wife's words as if they were the command of a god and said, "My dear, whatever you command, I will do. People should not see me bringing water, so I will get up in the west watch of the night and bring water every day." Because of his coming and going, the sound of his feet and the sound of filling the pot would wake up the herons sleeping on the trees near the pond. This story became known to the people. Jokingly, people started calling him Bakoddayak.

In a certain village, a man was attached to the touch of his wife's breasts and hips. He was obedient to every desire of his wife. In the morning, he would get up, join his palms, and ask his wife, "Dayite! What shall I do for you?" She would say, "Go and fetch water from the pond." Saying, "Whatever the dear one commands, I shall do that," he would bring water from the pond. Bringing the water, he would again ask, "Prāṇeśvarī! Now what shall I do?" His wife would say, "Extract rice from the earthen vessel and serve it to me. Before the meal, wash my feet and massage them with ghee," and so on. He would carry out all these tasks in the same manner. Knowing all these things, people named him Kiṃkara.

In a certain village, a man was under the command of his wife. Once, his wife was sitting on a seat in the kitchen. The husband asked her for food. She said, "Bring the plate." Saying, "What the beloved commands is the authority for me," he went and brought the plate. The wife served the food and said, "Go to the place of eating and have the meal." Again, he asked for chutney and vegetables. The wife said, "Come here with the plate." Then he went like a vulture to the wife with the plate. In this way, he took curd, etc. Knowing all these things, people named him Gṛdhraivariṅkhī.

Saying, "Whatever the dear one commands, I shall do that," he cleaned the cradle and the clothes.

## 37. Mānapīṇḍa: Sevāī-Dṛṣṭānta

In the city of Giripuspit in the Kauśala Janapada, an Ācārya named Simha arrived with his disciples. One day, there was a festival of making sevāī. On that day, after the Sūtra Paurauṣī, all the young sādhus gathered. They began to converse among themselves. One of the sādhus said, "Among so many sādhus, who is there who will bring sevāī in the morning?" A Kṣullaka named Guṇacandra said, "I will bring it." The sādhus said, "If the sevāī is not enough for all the sādhus, or if it is without ghee or jaggery, then it will be of no use to us. You must bring enough sevāī with ghee and jaggery." The Kṣullaka said, "As you wish, I will bring such sevāī." Making this promise, he took his begging bowl and went out to beg. He entered the house of a householder. The sādhus saw plenty of sevāī there. It was mixed with abundant ghee and jaggery. The sādhus, with many words of persuasion, requested the sevāī from the householder named Sulocana. The householder, completely refusing to give alms to the sādhus, said, "I will not give you anything." Then, in anger, the Kṣullaka Muni said, "I will definitely take this sevāī with ghee and jaggery." Hearing the Kṣullaka's words, Sulocana, also in a fit of anger, said, "If you obtain this sevāī in any way, I will consider that you have committed an offense against my nose." Then the Kṣullaka thought, "I must obtain sevāī from this house." With firm determination, he left the house and asked a person nearby, "Whose house is this?" The person told him that it was the house of Viṣṇumitra. The Kṣullaka again asked where Viṣṇumitra was at that time. The person replied, "He is currently in the assembly."

The Kṣullaka went to the assembly and asked, "Who is Viṣṇumitra among you?" The people said, "What do you want from Viṣṇumitra?" The sādhus said, "I will request something from him." Jokingly, they said, "He is very miserly, so he will not give you anything. Ask us for whatever you want." Then Viṣṇumitra thought that he should not be disregarded in front of so many people, so he said in front of them, "I am Viṣṇumitra, ask me for anything."

Then the Kṣullaka said, "If you are not one of the six men who are dominated by women, then I will request something." Then the people in the assembly asked, "Who are those six men who are dominated by women?" The Kṣullaka said that the names of those six men are as follows: 1. Śvetāṅguli 2. Bakodḍāyaka 3. Kinkara 4. Snāyaka 5. Gṛdhraivariṅkhī 6. Hadagña. 1. Gā. 219/6, Vr. P. 135,136, Nibha 4451, Cū. P. 421, Piṁpraṭī P. 60. 2. According to Jībhā, Giripuspit Nagar was in the Kauśala country (Jībhā 1395). 3. These six stories are under the 37th story, but for convenience, the description of these stories has been done before story no. 37.

Chapter 3: Stories
255. Hearing the description of the six individuals by Ksullaka, the people of the assembly laughed and said, "This woman-led man has the qualities of all six men, so don't ask him." Vishnu Mitra said, "I am not like these six men, so you may ask." At his insistence, Ksullaka said, "Give me sevai filled with ghee and jaggery in a vessel." Vishnu Mitra said, "I will give you sevai as you wish." Then Vishnu Mitra took Ksullaka to his house. Upon reaching the door of the house, Ksullaka said, "I had come to your house before, but your wife had vowed that she would not give me anything, so do whatever you think is right." Upon hearing this, Vishnu Mitra said, "If that is the case, then you wait outside for a while, I will call you myself."
Vishnu Mitra entered the house. He asked his wife, "Have you cooked the sevai?" "Have you added ghee and jaggery to it?" His wife said, "I have completed all the work." Vishnu Mitra looked at the jaggery and said, "This jaggery is a little less, this much jaggery will not be enough, so climb the male and bring more jaggery, so that I can feed the Brahmins." Hearing her husband's words, she climbed the male through the Nishreni. As soon as she climbed, Vishnu Mitra removed the Nishreni from there. Vishnu Mitra called Ksullaka and gave him a vessel full of sevai. After that, he started giving ghee and jaggery, etc. Meanwhile, Sulochana was eager to get down from the male with the jaggery, but she did not see the Nishreni there. She was surprised and saw Ksullaka being given sevai with ghee and jaggery, and thought that I have been defeated by this Ksullaka, so she shouted from above, "Don't give this Ksullaka anything." Ksullaka also looked at her and put his finger on his nose, indicating that I have poured into your nasal cavity. Ksullaka took the vessel of sevai with ghee and jaggery and went to his shelter. (This is an example of Manapinda). 38. Mayapinda: Ashadhabhuti Katha
King Simharath ruled in the city of Rajgriha. There were two daughters of a jester named Vishwakarma. They were very beautiful and had well-proportioned bodies. Once, while touring the villages, Acharya Dharmaruchi came there. One of his inner disciples was named Ashadhabhuti. While wandering for alms, he entered the house of Vishwakarma the jester. There he received special modak. As Ashadhabhuti Muni came out of the jester's house, he thought, "This modak is for the Acharya, so I will change my form and get a modak for myself." He made himself look like a blind Muni with his eyes and got another modak. After coming out, he thought again, "This will be for the Upadhyaya," so he again made himself look like a hunchback and entered the jester's house. After receiving the third modak, the Muni thought that this would be for the Singhare Muni, so

## The Appointment of the Body
This time, assuming the form of a leper, he entered the house. The Muni received the fourth modak. Vishwakarma, seated above the platform, saw him changing through so many forms. He thought that it would be good if he stayed among us, but how to attract him, thinking this, a strategy arose in the mind of the Nat. He thought that by distracting the Muni's mind through his daughters, he could draw his mind towards the world.

The Nat descended from the platform and went to the Muni, and respectfully offered him a bowl full of modaks. The Nat said, "You should grace us by accepting food at our house every day." He went to his shelter. Vishwakarma told his family about the art of transformation of Aṣāḍhabhūti, and told his two daughters, "You should attract the Muni towards you by giving him gifts with affectionate eyes." Aṣāḍhabhūti started coming to beg for food every day. Both daughters did as instructed. Seeing the Muni attracted towards them, once in private, they said to the Muni, "Our mind is greatly attracted to you, therefore, marry us and enjoy pleasures."

Hearing this, the charitravaraniya karma of Aṣāḍhabhūti Muni arose, due to which the wisdom in the form of the Guru's teachings left his heart. The pride of family and caste ended. The Muni said to both the Natakanyas, "It will be so, but first, I will leave the Muni-vesha and go to the Guru's feet." Aṣāḍhabhūti Muni prostrated at the Guru's feet and revealed his intention. The Guru, inspiring him, said, "Vats! For a wise and learned person like you, this conduct, which is repulsive in both worlds, is not appropriate. After observing the rules for a long time, do not now indulge in worldly pleasures. Can a person who swims in the ocean with his arms drown in a space as small as a cow's hoof?" Aṣāḍhabhūti said, "Your words are true, but due to the rise of adverse karmas, the weakening of the protective shield of the opposing feeling, the impact of Kamadeva, and the glances of the beautiful women with deer-like eyes, my heart has become completely shattered." Saying this, he left the Guru's feet. "How can I turn my back on such a benevolent Guru who has freed me?" Thinking this, he kept his feet back. "Again, how will I attain the Guru's lotus feet?" With various options in mind, he left the residence and came to Vishwakarma's house.

The Natakanyas looked at the Muni's body with unwavering eyes. They felt that the Muni's form was amazing. His face was as beautiful as the autumn moon. His eyes were like lotus petals, his nose was sharp, and his teeth were white and smooth like the flowers of the Kund. His chest was broad and fleshy like a door. His waist was like a lion's, and his feet were like a tortoise's.

Vishwakarma said to the Muni with respect, "Oh fortunate one! These are my two daughters, I dedicate them to you. Please accept them." The Nat married Aṣāḍhabhūti with both his daughters. Vishwakarma said to his two daughters, "The person who has attained such a state of mind, even after that, he does not leave the Guru's feet...

Aashaadhbhuti was skilled in all arts and possessed various types of extraordinary knowledge, therefore, he became the leader of all actors. He received abundant wealth, clothes, ornaments, etc., everywhere. Once, the king summoned the actors and ordered them to perform a play without women. All the actors left their wives at home and went to the royal palace. Aashaadhbhuti's wives thought, "Our husband has gone to the royal palace, therefore, the whole night will be spent there. Today, we will drink as much as we want." They did the same and due to intoxication, they became naked and slept on the second floor of the house.

Meanwhile, an envoy from another country arrived at the royal palace, therefore, the king's mind became distracted. "This is not the time for the play," thinking this, the king sent all the actors back. When Aashaadhbhuti reached the second floor and saw his two wives in a state of nakedness and hideous form, he thought, "Alas! What foolishness of mine! What a lack of wisdom, that I abandoned the means of liberation, *samyama*, for the sake of these women who are impure and the cause of my downfall. Nothing is lost yet. I will go to the feet of my Guru and regain my character and wash away the sins." Thinking this, Aashaadhbhuti started to leave his house. Vishwakarma saw him. From the expressions on Aashaadhbhuti's face, he understood that he had become detached from the world. He picked up his two daughters and said to them reproachfully, "Seeing your such intoxicated behavior, your husband has become detached from you, the cause of all your wealth. If you can bring him back, try, otherwise, beg for money to live."

Both wives put on clothes and ran to Aashaadhbhuti and fell at his feet. They pleaded, "Husband! Forgive our one offense and return home. Do not leave us in the middle of the river by becoming detached." Even after they said this, his mind did not waver. The wives said, "If you do not want to live a householder's life, then give us enough money to live, so that we can spend the rest of our lives well by your grace." Out of compassion, Aashaadhbhuti accepted their request and returned home.

Aashaadhbhuti prepared a play called "Rashtrapal" which revealed the character of Bharat Chakravarti. Vishwakarma requested King Singhstah to organize the play that Aashaadhbhuti had composed. He needed 500 princes adorned with ornaments for the performance of the play. The king ordered 500 princes. Aashaadhbhuti trained them properly. The play began. Aashaadhbhuti presented the character of Bharat Chakravarti and the princes also acted accordingly.

The play depicted how Bharat conquered the six continents, obtained the fourteen jewels and nine treasures, attained liberation by residing in the ideal house, and took initiation along with 500 princes, ...

This entire play was presented. Finally, the king, satisfied with the play, and all the people, as per their capacity, threw garlands, earrings, and other ornaments, as well as abundant amounts of clothes, etc. After giving Dharma-labha to all the people, Ashadhabhuti, with 500 princes, started to leave the royal palace. The king stopped him. He replied, "Did Bharat Chakravarti return to the world after taking Pravrajya? He did not return, so I will not return either." With his family, Ashadhabhuti went to the Guru. He gave all his clothes, ornaments, etc., to his two wives and took Diksha again. The same play was presented by Vishwakarma in Kusumpur Nagar as well. There too, 500 Kshatriyas became Pravrajit. People thought that if Kshatriyas take Pravrajya in this way, this earth will become devoid of Kshatriyas, so they burned the play's script in fire. (This is an example of Maya-pinda). 

## 39. Lobha-pinda: The Singhkesharak Modak-drishtaant
In the city of Champa, a Sadhu named Suvrat was residing. Once, there was a Modakotsav organized there. On that day, Muni Suvrat thought that he must obtain Singhkesharak Modak at any cost. Even when people prohibited him, he wandered for two Praharas. When he did not get the Modak, his mind became disturbed. Now, he started entering every house and instead of saying "Dharma-labha", he started saying "Singhkesharak Modak". Even after the whole day and two Praharas of the night, he kept wandering for the Modak. At midnight, he entered the house of a Shravak. Instead of "Dharma-labha", he uttered the word "Singhkesharak". That Shravak was very compassionate and skillful. He thought, "Surely, this Muni has not obtained Singhkesharak Modak anywhere, that's why his mind has become disturbed." For the mental stability of the Muni, the Shravak brought a vessel full of Singhkesharak Modak and requested, "Muni! Please accept these Modak." Muni Suvrat accepted them. As soon as he accepted the Modak, his mind became calm. The Shravak asked, "Today, I had rejected the first half, was it fulfilled or not?" Muni Suvrat used it for Kal-gyan. The Muni saw the sky-mandala adorned with stars. He realized his mental delusion. The Muni started repenting, "Alas! Due to my foolishness, I have acted wrongly. My life is wasted due to greed." Addressing the Shravak, the Muni said, "You saved me from drowning in the world by talking about the rejection of the first half. Your inspiration has been enlightening for me." Blaming his soul, he performed the Paristapan of the Modak according to the rules and destroyed the Ghatikarma with the fire of meditation in a moment. Through self-reflection, the Muni attained Kaivalya.

**40. Vidya-Prayog: The Story of the Bhikshu-Upasaka**

In the fragrant city of Gandhasamruddha, there lived a Bhikshu Upasaka named Dhandev. He never gave anything in alms to the Sadhus who came to his house. Once, some young Sadhus gathered together and started talking. One young Sadhu said, "This Dhandev is extremely miserly, he doesn't give anything to the Sadhus. Is there any Sadhu who can get ghee, jaggery, etc. as donations from him?" One of the Sadhus said, "If you all wish, give me the permission of the Vidya-pind, I will get donations from him." The Sadhu went to his house. After chanting mantras over the house, he asked the Sadhus, "What should I get?" The Sadhus said, "Ghee, jaggery, and clothes, etc." Dhandev gave the Sadhus a lot of ghee, jaggery, etc. After that, the Ksullaka performed the Vidya-pratisanhat. The effect of the mantra on the Bhikshu Upasaka Dhandev ended. He returned to his natural state. When he saw the ghee, jaggery, etc., they appeared to him in smaller quantities. He asked, "Who stole my ghee, jaggery, etc.?" Saying this, he started to lament. Then his family members explained to him, "You yourself gave the Sadhus ghee, jaggery, etc. with your own hands, then why are you lamenting like this?" Hearing their words, he became silent.

**41. Mantra-Prayog: The Story of King Murund and Padalipta Suri**

In the city of Pratiṣṭhānapura, King Murund ruled. There, Acharya Padalipta was staying. Once, King Murund experienced severe pain in his head. Even with Vidya, mantras, etc., no one could relieve him. The king called Acharya Padalipta, welcomed him, and told him about the headache that was occurring without any reason. Without anyone knowing, while chanting the mantra, he rotated the index finger of his right hand on the middle of his right thigh, and as he did so, the king's headache started to subside. Gradually, the pain in his entire head disappeared. King Murund became a great devotee of Acharya Padalipta. He gave the Acharya abundant gifts of food and drink.

**42. Churna-Prayog: The Story of the Two Ksullakas and Chanakya**

In the city of Kusumpura, King Chandragupta ruled. His minister's name was Chanakya. There, Acharya Susthit, who was deficient in his thighs, was staying. Once, there was a terrible famine. The Acharya thought, "I will establish my disciple Samruddha as an Acharya and send him with the entire Gachchha to a place with plenty of food." The Acharya started teaching him the Yoni-Prabhrit in seclusion.

Two Ksullaka monks heard the explanation of making an invisible ointment (anjana) that makes a person invisible to others when applied to the eyes. After becoming proficient in the explanation of Yoniprabhrta, the Acarya appointed his disciple Samriddhi as the Acarya. The Acarya sent him to another region along with the entire Gaccha. The Acarya himself started living there alone. After some days, those two Ksullaka monks, overwhelmed by the Acarya's affection, came to the Acarya. Whatever the Acarya received, he would distribute it among the Ksullaka monks and eat. He himself would take less food and give more to the monks. Due to lack of food, the Acarya's body became weak. Then the Ksullaka monks thought that the Acarya was becoming emaciated, so they will use the previously learned ointment (anjana) and eat with Chandragupta. They did the same. Due to lack of food, Chandragupta's body also became lean. Chanakya asked them, "Why does your body appear weak?" King Chandragupta said, "Due to not getting adequate food." Then Chanakya contemplated, "Even after serving so much food, how can there be a lack of food? It seems that a person skilled in ointment (anjana) is eating with the king." Then he scattered extremely fine brick powder in the dining hall to catch the ointment-skilled person. Chanakya saw the footprints marked on the powder. Chanakya was certain that two ointment-skilled persons were coming here. Chanakya covered the door and filled the dining hall with smoke. Due to the obstructed vision from the smoke, the ointment also got cleared. After the effect of the ointment was over, the two Ksullaka monks became visible. Chandragupta said with disgust, "Alas! I have been defiled by eating their leftover food." Chanakya found a solution so that the rule and preaching are not disregarded. He told the king, "O king! You are blessed. These celibate ascetic monks have purified you, but they have become impure by your leftover food." Chanakya paid obeisance to the two Ksullaka monks and sent them away.

At night, Chanakya went to the Acarya and, rebuking him, said, "Your two Ksullaka monks are disregarding the preaching." Then the Acarya, rebuking Chanakya, said, "You yourself are the offender, because even being a layman, you do not care for the livelihood of these two Ksullaka monks. In this time of famine, how does the life of a monk go on well, have you ever thought about it?" Saying "Your words are true, O Lord," Chanakya fell at their feet and begged for forgiveness. After that, Chanakya took appropriate care for the alms of the entire Sangha.

43. The story of the Kulapati and the Arya Samiti
Near the city of Achalapura, there were two rivers, Krishna and Venna. Between the two rivers was an island called Brahma. There, the Kulapati named Devasharma lived with five hundred ascetics. He used to perform rituals like Sankranti etc.

## Chapter 3: Stories

**261**

On festival days, to demonstrate the power of his pilgrimage, he would cross the Krishna River on foot with all his ascetics, walking on water. People were amazed by this extraordinary feat and would especially honor him with food and other offerings. People would criticize the monks, saying to the lay followers, "You people cannot have such power." The lay followers told this to Vajraswami's maternal uncle, Acharya Samit. He pondered and said to the lay followers, "This headman crosses the river by magic, not by the power of his austerities. If his feet are washed with hot water, he will not be able to cross the river." Then, to expose his magic, the lay followers invited the headman and his family for a meal. At mealtime, the headman arrived. The lay followers began to wash his feet, but fearing the loss of his magical power, he did not extend his feet. Then the lay followers said, "Without washing your feet, we will be guilty of disrespect by offering you food. A gift given with respect is more fruitful." The lay followers forcefully extended his feet and washed them. After the meal, the headman prepared to return to his place. The lay followers also called everyone and followed behind him. The headman, with his family, stepped into the Krishna River to cross it, but without the magical power of walking on water, he began to sink. People began to criticize him.

Meanwhile, Acharya Samit arrived there to enlighten him. He said to the river in front of everyone, "O Krishna, we wish to cross to the other side." Then the banks of the Krishna River met, and the width of the river became as wide as his feet. Acharya stepped across and went to the other side. The river widened again behind him, and he returned in the same way. Seeing this, the headman and his family, along with everyone else, were astonished. The headman, along with his five hundred ascetics, took initiation from Acharya Samit and later became famous as the Brahma branch.

**44. Example of the Karmic Effect: A Girl with a Defective Birth**

In a certain city, a wealthy man named Dhan lived with his wife, Dhanpriya. Their daughter's name was Sundari. She was born with a defective birth (a woman with an open vulva). Her mother knew this, but her father did not. Her father arranged her marriage with the son of a wealthy merchant. The time of the wedding approached. The mother was worried that if her husband learned of her daughter's condition after the wedding, he would leave her, and she would suffer. Meanwhile, a monk arrived there begging for alms. The monk asked the reason for her sadness. The mother told him everything. The monk said, "Do not fear, I will make her a woman with a perfect birth." Then the monk gave her a purification medicine and a medicine to be taken orally. Through the effect of the medicine, she became a woman with a perfect birth and was able to enjoy life for the rest of her life.

In the city of Chandranana, there lived a merchant named Dhanadatta. His wife's name was Chandramukha. One day, they had a quarrel. Due to attachment, he decided to marry another woman, the daughter of a wealthy Seth living in the same city. When Chandramukha learned about this, she became distressed. Meanwhile, a sadhu named Janghaparijit came to their house for alms. Seeing her sorrow, the sadhu asked her the reason for her distress. Chandramukha told the sadhu about her impending co-wife. The sadhu gave her a medicine and said, "In any way, feed her this medicine in bhakta or pan, which will make her a bhinnayonika. After that, tell your husband about it, so that he will not marry her." She did the same. Upon learning about the bhinnayonika, her husband did not marry her.

Thinking, "She will surely have a son," Jayasundari became envious and distressed. Meanwhile, a sadhu came. He asked, "Why do you look so worried?" Then she told him about her co-wife's impending pregnancy. The sadhu said, "Don't worry, I will make you pregnant too." Then Jayasundari said, "Although I will have a son by your grace, he will not be able to become the crown prince because he will be the younger one. Due to being the elder, the co-wife's son will be the rightful heir to the kingdom." The sadhu gave Jayasundari medicine for pregnancy and Shringarमति medicine for abortion. 2

## 47.  Dravya Grahanesha:  The Example of the Monkey Troop
There was a mountain called Vishalbhṛnga. In one of its forest tracts, a group of monkeys roamed. On that mountain, there was another forest tract, rich in all kinds of flowers, fruits, etc. In the heart of that forest tract, there lived a crocodile. Whoever entered the heart of the forest tract to drink water, be it a deer or any other animal, he would drag them in and eat them. Once, seeing the forest tract devoid of flowers and fruits, the monkey troop leader sent a pair of monkeys to search for another forest tract suitable for their livelihood. After searching, the pair of monkeys requested the troop leader, "There is a forest tract in such and such a region, which is rich in flowers, fruits, etc., in all seasons and suitable for our livelihood." The troop leader went there with his troop. He began to look at the entire forest tract carefully. The troop leader saw the heart filled with water. There were footprints of quadrupeds entering the heart.

But there were no footprints of the quadrupeds coming back from there. Then calling the youth, the monkey-youth-leader said - 'No one should enter this heart and drink water. Drink water from the stream located on the bank, this heart is not free from trouble.' Here, the footprints of deer etc. entering are visible, but those of coming out are not visible. The monkeys who followed his words, continued to live happily. Those who did not follow the words of the youth-leader, perished.

**48. Child-giving: The Girl-Example**

A newly initiated Shravaka told her daughter - 'Give alms to the Shramans.' The Shravaka went to her field. After the Shravaka left, a Sadhu came to her house for alms. The girl gave the Sadhu Tandulodak. The leader of the Singhare, that Sadhu, knowing the girl to be simple, out of attachment, repeatedly said - 'Give a little more.' The girl gave all the Odan. Similarly, she gave all the Mung, ghee, buttermilk, yogurt, etc. in alms. In the afternoon, her mother came. When she sat down to eat, she asked her daughter for Odan etc. food. The girl said - 'I gave all the Odan to the Sadhu.' The Shravaka said - 'You did a good deed. Serve me Mung.' The girl said - 'I gave all the Mung to the Sadhu too.' Whatever the Shravaka asked for, the girl gave the same answer that she had given it to the Sadhu. Finally, she asked for Kanji. For that too, the girl said - 'I gave that to the Sadhu too.'

That newly initiated Shravaka, angry at the girl, said - 'Why did you give all the food to the Sadhu?' The girl replied - 'The Sadhu repeatedly asked, so I gave him everything.' The Shravaka, in a fit of anger, went to the Acharya. Telling him the whole story, she said - 'Your such and such Sadhu has taken all the food from my daughter by asking for it again and again.' Hearing her loud words, the neighboring people also came to know about it. They too became angry and started to criticize the Sadhu. So that the preaching would not be condemned, the Acharya, in front of everyone, took all the Sadhu's equipment and expelled him from the residence. On expelling him from the shelter, the Shravaka's anger subsided. She pleaded with the Acharya - 'Do not expel this Sadhu from the residence because of me. Forgive his one offense.' After teaching the Sadhu in many ways, the Acharya re-admitted him into the Sangha.

**49. Vomited Fault: The Honey-Drop-Example**

In the city of Warattpur, there was a king named Abhayasen. His minister's name was Waratrak. Once, while walking slowly from the Esana Committee, a restrained Sadhu named Dharmaghosh entered a house for alms. The minister's wife, to give alms to the Sadhu, overturned the vessel of payas containing ghee and sugar. A ghee mixed with sugar

---------------------------
## English Translation:

**264**

The point of the pin fell to the ground. Then, the Muni Dharmaghosh, with his mind fixed on liberation, profound like the ocean, unshakable like Mount Meru, all-embracing like the earth, detached from passions like a conch shell, dedicated to the destruction of karma like the great Subhata, and engaged in the method of accepting alms as instructed by the Lord, thought, "Food tainted by the vomit of sin is not fit for me." Therefore, without accepting alms, he left the house. The minister Varatraka, riding on a maddened elephant, saw the Muni leaving and thought, "Why did the Muni not accept alms from my house?" As the minister pondered, many flies came to the point of ghee mixed with sugar. A lizard came to eat them. A hawk came to kill the lizard. A cat ran to devour the hawk, and a fierce dog ran to kill it. Another dog, a resident of that place, ran to kill the dog. The two dogs began to fight. Their owners, their minds troubled by the defeat of their respective dogs, engaged in a battle. The minister Varatraka witnessed this entire scene and thought in his mind, "Even a mere drop of ghee, falling to the ground, has caused strife. Therefore, the Muni, fearing violence, did not accept alms upon seeing the drop of ghee on the ground. Oh! The Lord's Dharma is very strong. Who, other than the Omniscient, can preach such a faultless Dharma?" Pondering thus, he became detached from the world. Just as a lion emerges from a mountain cave, so too did the minister Varatraka, emerging from his palace, approach the sage Dharmaghosh and accepted the vow of renunciation. That great soul, remaining detached from the body, observed the vows of restraint and studied the scriptures with a mind filled with devotion. For a long time, he followed the path of restraint, then ascended to the क्षपक श्रेणी (Kshapaka श्रेणी), and upon the complete destruction of his harmful karmas, he attained the wealth of pure knowledge and, in due course, attained Siddhi-Gati (liberation).

**50. The Greed for Material Possessions: The Fish Analogy**

A fisherman went to the lake to catch fish. Approaching the lake, he cast a net with a piece of meat attached to it into the middle of the lake. In that lake, there lived an old fish, wise and experienced. Smelling the scent of the meat attached to the hook, he went to eat it and carefully consumed all the meat around it. Then, he pushed the hook away with his tail. The fisherman thought, "The fish is caught in the net," so he pulled the hook towards him. He saw the hook without the fish and the meat. The fisherman again attached meat to the hook and cast it into the lake. Again, the fish ate the meat and pushed the hook away with its tail and escaped. Thus, he ate the meat three times, but the fisherman could not catch him.

Seeing the fisherman worried after the meat was finished, the fish said, "Why are you thinking like this? Listen to my story, which will make you feel ashamed. I have been caught in the mouth of a बलाका (Balaka) three times and escaped from it. Once, I was caught by a बलाका, and it put me in its mouth.

Page #437:
---------------------------
Par. 3: Stories
265
I was thrown upwards. I thought that if I fell directly into its mouth, my life would not be saved. Therefore, I would fall obliquely into its mouth. Thinking this, I quickly did so. I came out of its mouth. Again, the second time, I went into its mouth and came out. The third time I fell into the water, so I went away. Three times I fell into the burning sand on the seashore in the form of a furnace, but I quickly returned to the sea with the waves. Similarly, even when I was caught in the net laid by the fisherman twenty-one times, I escaped from the net before the fisherman tightened it. Once, the fisherman caught me with many other fish after taking out the water from the heart and emptying it. He was stringing all the fish together on a sharp iron rod. Then, I cleverly avoided the fisherman's sight and placed myself on the mouth of the iron rod. When the fisherman went to the lake to wash the mud-covered fish, I quickly submerged myself in the water. Thus, you want to catch me, who is powerful, with a thorn, this is your shamelessness.' Concluding this story, the storyteller says that even if you avoid the 42 faults of Aeshana, O being! If you indulge in the faults of Grassaeshana, then this is your shamelessness.'

_A person with a contagious disease is one whose body is decaying, whose blood is flowing out, and whose body is broken or split. Such a person can transmit leprosy and other contagious diseases._

(Ga. 276, Mavri P. 160)

## Pindaniyukti
Taking alms from someone whose body is excessively bleeding semi-cooked blood can lead to leprosy infection.
## Benefits of Warm Food
**270**
* **Trika Ushna:** For householders, even if they consume only Sauvira etc., their food gets digested due to the warmth of their food, bed, and clothing. They do not experience indigestion or other ailments. (Mavri P. 167)
* Food gets digested by heat.
## Why Consume Vikriti-Vigaya?
To bring lightness to the body, to increase the practice of restraint and yoga, and to gain strength, one should consume Vikriti-Vigaya. (Mavri P. 168)
## Buttermilk Kindles Digestive Fire
Buttermilk etc. kindle the digestive fire. (Ga. 318/1)
## Hunger Pain
There is no pain like hunger, therefore one should eat to alleviate it.
## Abandoning Food During Fever
One should not eat when fever arises due to fear. (Mavri P. 168)
## Exceptions to Fasting During Fever
Fasting is beneficial in fever, except for fever caused by wind, exertion, anger, grief, desire, and injury. (Mavri P. 177)

## Chapter 4: Ayurveda and Health

**Consequences of Excessive Food Intake**

"Eating excessively, too often, and in excess quantity can cause diarrhea, vomiting, and even death if the food is not digested." (Ga. 312/2)

Who is a physician?

"Those who eat harmful food, those who eat excessive food, and those who eat insufficient food are not physicians. They are seekers of their own well-being." (Ga. 313 Mavri P. 174)

Those who eat food that is not incompatible with their body constitution and is beneficial are called *hitaahari*. Those who eat in moderation and according to their body's needs are called *mitaahari*. Those who eat less than 32 *kavala* (mouthfuls) are called *alpaahari*. Physicians do not treat such individuals because they do not develop diseases due to their beneficial, moderate, and limited food intake.

**Unfavorable Food**

"A combination of yogurt, oil, and milk, yogurt, and *kanji* is harmful. It is incompatible food." (Ga. 313/1 Mavri P. 174)

"Milk is incompatible with vegetables, sour fruits, *pinyaka*, *kapittha*, salt, *karir*, yogurt, and fish." (Ga. 313/1 Mavri P. 174)

Combining compatible substances is beneficial. It destroys existing diseases and prevents future ones. It is said, "All diseases arise from consuming harmful food. Therefore, one should abandon harmful food and consume beneficial food." (Ga. 313/1 Mavri P. 174)

**Quantity of Food**

"For a person of average build, the quantity of food should be divided into two parts for the morning and evening meals. For a person with a strong constitution, the quantity should be reduced to one-sixth."

Page #444:
---------------------------
##  Translation:

**272**

The stomach is divided into six parts. Of these, three parts should be allocated for food, including condiments, buttermilk, and vegetables. Two parts should be for water, and the remaining sixth part should be kept empty for air circulation.

(Ga. 313/2, Mavrp. 175) The stomach should be divided into six parts, with half, i.e., three parts, for food, two parts for water, and the remaining sixth part should be kept empty for air circulation.

In extreme cold, one part should be allocated for water and four parts for food. In moderate cold, two parts should be for water and three parts for food. In moderate heat, two parts should be for water and three parts for food. In extreme heat, three parts should be for water and two parts for food. In all seasons, the sixth part should always be kept empty for air circulation.

(Ga. 313/4, Mavrp. 175) In extreme cold, one part should be allocated for water and four parts for food. In moderate cold, two parts should be for water and three parts for food. In moderate heat, two parts should be for water and three parts for food. In extreme heat, three parts should be for water and two parts for food. In all seasons, the sixth part should always be kept empty for air circulation.

One part is allocated for water, and two parts for food. The remaining two parts increase or decrease. This means that two parts are for food and two parts for water, which increase or decrease. In extreme cold, two parts of food increase, and two parts of water decrease. In extreme heat, two parts of water increase, and two parts of food decrease.

(Ga. 313/5, Mavrp. 175) The stomach is divided into six parts, with two parts allocated for food. The remaining two parts increase or decrease. In extreme cold, two parts of food increase, and two parts of water decrease. In extreme heat, two parts of water increase, and two parts of food decrease.

Appendix-6
Words that have the same meaning are called synonyms. For these, terms like 'abhivacan', 'nirukti paryay' and 'nirvacan' are also mentioned. The use of synonyms has been an important part of the explanation of any subject. The purpose of synonyms in the Brihatkalpabhashya is explained as follows:
Bandhanulomaya khlu, suttammi ya laghavam asammoho.
Saththaguṇadīvaṇā vi ya, egaṭṭhaguṇā havnteē. The arrangement of the chanda, the brevity of the sutra, the absence of confusion and the deepening of the scholarly qualities are the qualities of synonyms. In addition, the use of synonymous words strengthens the student's knowledge of language and lexicography. The author also uses synonyms for the benefit of students from different languages, so that students from every country can easily understand the meaning of the word. Synonyms are also used to establish the intensity and importance of any matter. The use of synonyms in context for the sake of emotional intensity is not considered a repetition fault. It is a linguistic peculiarity of the author that they write synonyms of the original word of the sutra and then explain it. The author has also mentioned synonyms of some words in the context of Pindaniyukti, which are being mentioned here.

Appendix-7
Nirukta
Nirukta means - to explain the meaning of a word by deriving its etymology. From this perspective, Yaska's Nirukta is an important text. In Jain Agamas, ancient texts like Bhagavati and Sutra Kritanga also contain Niruktas of words. This suggests that it was a brief ancient method of interpretation. Nirukta helps in knowing the original meaning and nature of the word.
Many Niruktas have been used in the entire Nirukta literature, such as the Nirukta of Kama - 'Ukkamayanti Jeevam Dhammao Ten Te Kama'. Similarly, in Aavashyak Niyukti, a beautiful Nirukta of the word 'Micchami Dukkadam' has been given based on its etymology. Such Niruktas are not found in other literature. Although the rules of grammar have not been taken into account in this, it is a beautiful example from the perspective of Nirukta and meaning.
Micchami Dukkadam
Mi tti Miumaddavatte, Ch tti Ya Dosana Chhayane Hoti. Mi tti Ya Meraya Thio, Du tti Duguchami Appaanam. Ka tti Kadam Me Pavam, Da tti Ya Devemi Tam Uvasamenam.
Eso Micchadukkadapayakkharattho Samaasenam. (Aavani 436/21, 22) - In this, the etymology of each letter has been given, some by words and some by roots. We find many such important Niruktas in Nirukta literature. Here only the Niruktas found in Pind Niyukti and its commentary have been mentioned. Although Pind Niyukti is not rich in terms of Niruktas, some important Niruktas are found.
Atmakarma-Parakarma Atmakarma Kriyate Ityatmakarma.
(Mavri P. 50) Atmaj - • Killing Pranadi etc. regularly, killing oneself in the form of feet etc., 'Panivhe Vayabhango' etc. from the words, therefore Adhakarma is called Atmaghna.
(Mavri P. 52) • Killing oneself, destroying oneself as a cause of falling into hell, is called Atmaghna. (Mavri P. 36) Adha - Adhiyate Asya Ityadha.
(Mavri P. 36) Udbhinna - Udbhedanam Udbhinnam.
(Mavri P. 35) Uddes - Uddeshanam Uddesah.
(Mavri P. 35) Upakaran - Upakriyate Anenetyupakarnam.
(Mavri P. 84) Jvalan - Jvalatiti Jvalanah.
(Mavri P. 5) Tapan - Tapatiti Tapanah.

## Native Words

Words that do not have any root or suffix, are not derived from any language, and are taken from a tradition or regional language are called native words. Acharya Hemchandra, in his *Deshinam Mala*, clarifies the nature of native words, writing:

> "Those words which are not proven or unproven, which are not found in the scriptures, and which are not derived from any language, are considered native words." (1)

Vyakarana Trivikram says that *Aarsh* and *Deshya* words are the established usage of different languages, hence they do not require grammar. The *Naipatik* words mentioned in *Anuyogadwar* can be considered under native words. In *Agam* and their commentary texts, there is mention of 18 types of native languages. It is not clear which these 18 languages were. Due to being learned in different regions, Acharyas used various regional words to enrich the knowledge of their disciples. Many regional native words have been used in *Nirukti* literature.

**Appendix-8**

*Pindanirukti* uses native words extensively. Commentator Malayagiri used phrases like "Deshivacanametad" and "Deshitvat" for many words, but besides these, many native words and native verbs have been used in this text.

Some Acharyas consider number words like *Panpanna*, *Pannas*, *Bayalis*, etc. as native words. We have not included number words in this collection. There is disagreement among scholars about imitative words and verbs received by order, but we have accepted them as native words. Many words are also found in Sanskrit dictionaries, but if they are considered native in *Deshinam Mala*, then they have been included in this collection. The *Deshishabda Kosh*, published by Jain Vishvabharati, Ladnun, has selected over ten thousand native words.

Appendix-9
**Verses-Subhashitas**

The literal meaning of *Sukti* is - well-said. A saying in which there is a miracle of experience and expression is called *Sukti*. Those that create a vibration for the transformation of inner consciousness are called *Subhashitas*. In *Sukti*, the experience of a lifetime is poured into a few words. This brings dynamism and beauty to the language style.

The *Suktis* and *Subhashitas* used in *Pindanuyukti* are not only instructive but also life-touching and inspiring.

The study of *Nuyukti* literature suggests that the *Nuyuktikars* did not make any effort anywhere, but while naturally describing the subject, they descended into verses or stanzas in the form of *Suktis*, for example - *Bhave Ya Asanjammo Sattham* - from the point of view of *Bhava*, non-restraint is the greatest weapon. Here, in the description of *Dravya* and *Bhava* weapons, this stanza presents a very big fact before us from the point of view of non-violence.

Through the use of *Sukti* and *Subhashita*, the most serious facts have been revealed in a very simple and natural language.

Here are the *Suktis* and *Subhashitas* collected from *Pindanuyukti* and its commentary:

* *Asubhabhavo Vajjeyavvo Payattenam.* (Ga. 67/4)
* *Satabahulparampara, Vocchedo Sanjam-Tavanan.* (Ga. 83/2)

* *Jo U Asanjam Sahati, Kilissati Na Tam Cha Saheti.* (Ga. 116/4)
* *Danam Na Hoti Aphalm, Pattamapattesu Sannijjujjantm.* (Ga. 213)
* *Duittm Khu Garahitm.* (Ga. 201/2)
* *Suttas Appamane, Charanabhavo Tao Tu Mokkhas. Mokkhas Vi Ya Abhave, Dikkhapavitti Niraththa U.* (Ga. 240)
* *Hiyaahara Miyaahara, Appaahara Ya Je Nara. Na Te Vijja Tigicchanti, Appaanam Te Tigicchga.* (Ga. 313)

**Appendix-10 Similes and Illustrations**

Anything that is explained through a simile or illustration becomes easily understandable. Similes add beauty, fluency and uniqueness to literature. Similes are the ornaments of poetry. The author has explained even the most difficult subjects in a simple and fluent manner through similes. Some similes are so simple and written in such a fluent language that their meaning is understood as soon as they are read.

Some similes also give us an idea of the culture, country, time and environment of that time. Illustrations have also been used extensively like similes. Here only the similes and illustrations of Pindaniya are compiled.

* **Where the cause is a thread, the effects are like a net.** (Ga. 49/1)
* **Where the cause is a seed, the effect is always the same.** (Ga. 49/2)
* **Like a burning ember in another's hand, it does not burn.** (Ga. 68/2)
* **Like a delicious food that is not eaten, even if it is well-cooked.** (Ga. 85)
* **Like a bad smell that spreads, like a bad taste that is not eaten.** (Ga. 92)
* **Like a cow that is tied up, it should be treated like a cow.** (Ga. 96)
* **Like a poisonous snake that bites, it dies by eating its own poison.** (Ga. 123)
* **Like a ghee lamp that is lit.** (Ga. 177/2)
* **Like a small thing that becomes big.** (Ga. 179/1)
* **Like a very strong rope.** (Ga. 208/1)
* **Like curdled milk that is not ripe, it is ripe and unripe.** (Ga. 293)
* **Like the purpose of a thing, like the purpose of fuel for fire.** (Ga. 302/1)
* **Like a burning ember, it quickly burns the fuel of the feet.** (Ga. 314/2)
* **Like a burning ember, it does not burn until it is extinguished.** (Ga. 314/3)

Appendix-11
Nikkhepa is a specific method of explaining a word. This is a unique contribution of Jain Acharyas in the field of linguistics. In Prakrit, there are many possible Sanskrit transformations of the same word. The Nikkhepa method provides knowledge of all possible meanings of that word and thus helps in understanding the contextual meaning of the word. Nikkhepa is an important part of the science of semantic development under linguistics.
This is a special contribution of Jain Acharyas in the field of Nyaya. Nikkhepa is actually a type of explanation, which includes Upkrama, Anugam and Nay. In the Upaddhata Niyukti, any subject is explained in 12 ways, in which Nikkhepa is given the first place. The purpose of Nikkhepa is to provide four-sided knowledge of the object or word and finally to provide knowledge of the pure word.
Generally, many Nikkhepas can be done as needed, but its four types are famous: 1. Naam Nikkhepa 2. Sthapana Nikkhepa 3. Dravya Nikkhepa 4. Bhav Nikkhepa.
A word is a speaker of a person or thing. The concept of Naam Nikkhepa was conceived to reveal this form of the word. The imputation of one object in another object through imagination is Sthapana Nikkhepa. Dravya Nikkhepa is the one that reveals the tri-temporal state of the object. Bhav Nikkhepa is indicative of the Jain practice method. The true nature of the object is known through this. Any word or knowledge is limited to Dravya only until the consciousness of use is not attached to it. In Bhav Nikkhepa, there is a harmony between language and emotion.
The whole behavior of the world runs on the Nikkhepa method. When a child is born, he lives in the world of only Naam Nikkhepa. When he grows up a little, he establishes an object through imagination, like establishing a mother or sister in a plastic doll. Gradually, he becomes capable of tri-temporal knowledge and later, when the subtlety and understanding of the intellect develops, he conducts his behavior through Bhav Nikkhepa. Bhav Nikkhepa is the result of practice.
Nikkhepa is the practical and lively use of Anekanta. For example, someone was rich in the past, he is also called Seth in the present. This may be untrue, but it is also possible through Dravya Nikkhepa.
The Niyuktikar adopted Nikkhepa in his method of explanation. If the Nikkhipta Gatha and its explanation are collected from the entire Niyukti literature, a great book can be prepared. Here

**Chapter 15: Verses Quoted from the Malayagiri Vritti**

305
The wisdom of those who have not meditated on the scriptures and the ancient texts, even if they are eager to know, does not flourish.
(P. 44) O foolish one, do not indulge in worldly pleasures, having abandoned the path of right conduct. Who will protect you, when you are drowning in the ocean of samsara?
(P. 137) The root of true knowledge is the path of renunciation, as taught by the Jinas. Know this, and experience intense fervor.
(P. 178, Vyabha 2485) A thin, emaciated person becomes like a dry, withered tree, while a stout, well-nourished person is like a strong, sturdy tree.
(P. 123) There is no suffering like old age, no disgrace like poverty, no fear like death, and no pain like the pain of the senses.
(P. 177) The leaves, the branches, the trunk, the roots, and the hair of the tree are all connected. Similarly, the king, the subjects, and the entire kingdom are interconnected.
(P. 13, Prasaga 491, Bribha 3962) Since there is no transfer or division of karma done by others, therefore, the karma of each being is its own.
(P. 44) The path of liberation is the path of righteousness, austerity, knowledge, and non-duality.
(P. 97, Prasaga 934) There is no liberation for those who are attached to their possessions. Liberation is attained only by those who have renounced all attachments.
(P. 178) In case of fever or other ailments, it is beneficial to take a light diet.
(P. 177) Passion leads to wrong views, and wrong views lead to the destruction of the path of liberation.
(P. 120, Dasani 221/1) The five senses, the mind, and the body are the six enemies of the soul.
(P. 25, Prasaga 557) The objects of the senses disappear for the one who has renounced all attachments.
(P. 177, Gita 2/59) Milk is generally incompatible with sour fruits, vegetables, and salty foods.
(P. 174) Restraint is the path of liberation, and attachment is the cause of suffering.
(P. 4, Panv 133) The world is full of suffering, deceit, and ignorance.
(P. 25, Prasaga 739) The essence of the path of liberation is the path of renunciation, as taught by the Jinas.
(P. 178, Vyabha 2484) The subtle body, the gross body, and the mind are all subject to decay.
(P. 118) The soul is liberated from the cycle of birth and death by renouncing all attachments.
(P. 4)

In 1655, Yuga Pradhan Acharya Shri Tulsi commenced the work of *Agam-vachana*, which was the first such reading after the assembly held in the presence of Devardhigani Kshamashraman in 453. By 1666, 32 *Agams* had been published with research-based original texts and 7 *Agams* with Sanskrit shadow, Hindi translation and commentary literature. In addition, many rich texts have come to light from the perspective of *kosh*-literature. The editing and translation of *Agams* along with *niyukti* and *bhashya*-literature is also being published gradually. The main editor and commentator (bhashyakar) of this *vachana* is Acharya Shri Mahaprajna (Muni Nathmal/Yuvacharya Mahaprajna), who has done the arduous task of presenting Jain *Agam*-literature in modern language with critical commentary through his editing skills. The commentary includes critical notes based on comparative studies of Vedic, Buddhist and Jain literature, Ayurveda, Western philosophy and modern science. The entire *Agam* literature published by Jain Vishva Bharati is contained in approximately one lakh pages. In the latter part of his ninth decade, Acharya Mahaprajna is engaged in the arduous task of *Bhagavati Bhashya*. This invaluable treasure trove of *Agam* literature will prove helpful for those working in the field of research.
