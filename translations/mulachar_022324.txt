**Introduction**
Today, I present before the esteemed Jain readers the great treatise on the monastic code, **Sri Mulachara**, with Sanskrit commentary and Hindi translation. It elaborates on all the practices of the monastic code in great detail. It comprises twelve chapters:
* **Mulaguna Adhikar** (Chapter on Fundamental Qualities)
* **Brihat Pratyakhyana Samstarastava Adhikar** (Chapter on Detailed Renunciation)
* **Sankshepa Pratyakhyana Adhikar** (Chapter on Brief Renunciation)
* **Samachara Adhikar** (Chapter on Conduct)
* **Panchachara Adhikar** (Chapter on Five Conduct)
* **Pindashuddhi Adhikar** (Chapter on Purity of the Body)
* **Shadavashyaka Adhikar** (Chapter on Six Essentials)
* **Dwadashanupreksha Adhikar** (Chapter on Twelve Contemplations)
* **Anugara Bhavana Adhikar** (Chapter on Non-Attachment)
* **Samasara Adhikar** (Chapter on the Cycle of Existence)
* **Shilaguna Adhikar** (Chapter on Qualities of Conduct)
* **Paryapti Adhikar** (Chapter on Attainment)

Each chapter is named according to its content.
Until now, no treatise on the monastic code had been published. As a result, many **bhavya jivas** (noble souls) were unaware of the nature of the monastic practices. Now, by the grace of fortune, **Muni Anantkirti** has published this great treatise through **Di. Jain Granthamala** for the benefit of **bhavya jivas**. The original author of this treatise is **Sri Vattakera Khami**. The Sanskrit commentary on this treatise is by **Sri Vasunandisiiddhantachakravarti**, the author of **Acharavritti**. The second Sanskrit commentary, **Mulachara Pradeepika**, is by **Sri Sakalakirti**.

The Acharya has also created it and according to the first Acharavritti Sanskrit commentary, the Jaipuri Deshbhasha commentary was created by Pandit Nandlalji, a resident of Jaipur, up to 516 Gathas. After that, the said Panditji passed away. Later, Pandit Rishabhdasji completed the remaining half of the commentary. Regarding this, there is also a Kavitt of the language creator, "Tika Deshbhashamay Prarambhi Su Nandlal Puran Kari Rishabhdas Yah Nirdhar Hai". In Jainism, Moksha is only through Muni Dharma, therefore, this scripture will be directly useful for Moksha. This language commentary has been done according to the said language commentary. Now, we will not write anything special, but only say that the patron of this series of scriptures, Shriman Seth Sukhanandji, who has rescued this scripture, deserves our heartfelt gratitude. We hope that the said Seth Sahib will continue to show his generosity in increasing the fund for this. 

Finally, we pray that any errors that may have remained in the editing and revision of this scripture may be corrected by the learned gentlemen who are lovers of knowledge, and they may forgive me and study it. This is enough for the knowledgeable. Jain Scripture Rescue Office, Servant of Jinvani, Khattar Galli, Haudawadi.

Muni Anantkirti Di. Jain - Granthamala
1 This Granthamala is dedicated to the memory of the late Muni Anantkirtiji. It will contain the restoration of ancient Vedic texts. Its patron is Shriman Seth Guru Mukhray Sukhanandji.
2 The reason for opening it in the name of Muni Maharaj is that once Muni Maharaj was traveling and arrived in Mumbai. One day, Muni Maharaj's food was served with Navdha Bhakti at the house of the famous Seth Sukhanandji here. In his joy, Seth Sahib, to show his generosity, donated eleven hundred and one rupees (1101) in the name of Muni Ji for the restoration of Jain texts. Muni Maharaj then continued his travels and arrived in the city of Morena, where he passed away due to illness. A few days later, the great text of Muni Dharma, Moolachar, was published in Hindi language with commentary in the name of Muni Maharaj with those eleven hundred and one rupees.
3 The price of all the texts published in it will be kept at cost. The cost will include the editing, proofreading, printing, binding, office expenses, and commission.

## Gatha

The wheel of the world, all this is the essence of the teachings...
The Samana, as it is said first,
Should be examined in terms of conduct.
All beginnings of life,
All beings, all food, all food,
Then, in the same way, the conduct...
To be done by the followers of restraint...
The conduct of restrained virtues, happiness and sorrow are equal,
Skillful in accepting the teachings of the happy, the sad, and the indifferent,
Skillful in accepting the teachings of the gathered,
The service of the followers of the path of restraint,
The conch, the goat, the bee,
With determination, to give,
To be united in the practice of restraint,
To be established in the right understanding,
The son of the Ganadhara,
There, he meditates, he says,
That which is great...
The sound, the form, the fragrance,
To know the essence...
The true, the untrue, the delusion...

##  Fundamental Conduct
Bowing my head and offering salutations to the three crore and nine lakh ascetics, from the distracted to the liberated, and to the infinite number of perfected beings, I speak of the fundamental virtues of Jain ascetics, which benefit both this world and the next. || 1 ||

I will now describe the twenty-eight aspects of these fundamental virtues in two verses:

-
Five great vows, five assemblies instructed by the Jinas, five restraints of the senses, six necessities, and the eye of knowledge. || 2 ||
Wearing a cloth, bathing, sleeping on the ground, not brushing teeth, standing while eating, and taking only one meal are the twenty-eight fundamental virtues. || 3 ||

Meaning: The five great vows, the five assemblies instructed by the Jinas, the five restraints of the senses, the six necessities, the eye of knowledge, wearing a cloth, bathing, sleeping on the ground, not brushing teeth, standing while eating, and taking only one meal are the twenty-eight fundamental virtues of Jain ascetics. || 2, 3 ||

Now, I will first describe the five great vows:
Non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, non-possession, and celibacy are the five great vows, known as the five virtues. || 4 ||

Page #40:
---------------------------
## The Five Great Vows (Mahavratas)

**1. Non-Violence (Ahimsa)**

**Verse 4:** The five great vows are: renunciation of violence, truthfulness, renunciation of stealing, celibacy, and renunciation of possessions.

**Verse 5:** Knowing all living beings in their body, senses, qualities, paths, families, lifespans, and births, and renouncing violence and other harmful actions in all situations, is non-violence (Ahimsa).

**Explanation:**  Renouncing actions that harm living beings in their body, senses, qualities, paths, families, lifespans, and births, is the essence of the vow of non-violence.

**2. Truthfulness (Satya)**

**Verse 6:** Renouncing false speech due to attachment, aversion, delusion, etc., and avoiding speech that causes distress to others, as well as speaking truthfully even when explaining the meaning of the scriptures, is truthfulness (Satya).

**Explanation:**  The vow of truthfulness involves speaking truthfully, avoiding falsehoods motivated by attachment, aversion, or delusion, and refraining from causing distress to others through speech. It also includes speaking truthfully when explaining the scriptures.

**3. Non-Stealing (Asteya)**

**Verse 7:**  Renouncing taking anything from others, even a small amount, whether it is given willingly or not, and refraining from taking anything that belongs to others, is non-stealing (Asteya).

Page #41:
---------------------------
## Mulachara

**7.**  **Paradravya** (property of others) collected by others in villages, etc., including lost, abandoned, or small items, should not be taken. This is **Adattaparivarjana** (non-acceptance of what is not given), which is the **Achauryamahavrat** (great vow of non-stealing).

**8.**  **Brahmacharya** (celibacy) is the **trilokapujya** (venerated by the three worlds) **brahma** (divine state) achieved by seeing women (mother, daughter, sister) or their images as such, and abstaining from all thoughts, words, and actions related to them.

**9.**  **Parigrahatyaga** (renunciation of possessions) is the **nirmamo asango** (detachment and non-attachment) achieved by renouncing both **jiivanibaddha** (inner possessions) and **jiivasambhava** (external possessions) that are connected to living beings.

Page #42:
---------------------------
##  The Great Vow of Non-Possession (Asanga)

1. The renunciation of possessions, such as pearls, conch shells, teeth, blankets, etc., which are either inanimate or have originated from living beings, by manifesting their power, or the absence of attachment to these or other instruments of restraint, knowledge, and purity, is the Great Vow of Non-Possession (Asanga). || 9 ||

**Five Restraints (Samitis)**

10. The five restraints are: Restraint of Movement (Iriya Samiti), Restraint of Speech (Bhasa Samiti), Restraint of Effort (Eshana Samiti), Restraint of Taking and Giving (Aadan Niksepan Samiti), and Restraint of Disposal (Pratistapana Samiti) which includes the disposal of urine, feces, etc., in a pure place. || 10 ||

**Restraint of Movement (Iriya Samiti)**

11. Restraint of Movement is walking on a path free from living beings, observing four cubits ahead during the day, and not causing harm to any living being while performing one's duties. || 11 ||

**Restraint of Speech (Bhasa Samiti)**

12. Restraint of Speech is refraining from speaking words that are harsh, sarcastic, deceitful, or that cause pain to others. || 12 ||

---------------------------
## Mulachara

**Verse 12:**

Avoiding backbiting, vain laughter, harsh speech, criticism, self-praise, and stories about women, food, kings, and thieves, speaking words that benefit oneself and others is called **Bhasha Samiti**.

**Verse 13:**

Free from 36 faults, with a cause like hunger and the means of Dharma, pure in nine aspects (like action and its result), and with equanimity in eating cold, hot, etc., is called **Eshana Samiti**.

**Verse 14:**

With the restraint of knowledge, the restraint of conduct, the restraint of purity, or any other restraint, the deliberate taking and giving is called **Adana Niksepa Samiti**.

Page #44:
---------------------------
##  Mūlagunādhikāra 1.

**14.** The act of diligently (with careful consideration and research) taking and keeping the instruments for knowledge, such as books and other tools (jñānopaśi), the instruments for restraint, such as the practice of non-violence (saṁyama), such as the practice of non-violence (saṁyama), the instruments for purity, such as the pot for washing the body (kaṁḍalū) and other tools for cleansing the body (śaucopaśi), and the instruments for other purposes, such as the tools for other purposes (anyopaśi), is called the **Ādānanikshepana Samiti**.

**15.** Now, the nature of the **Pratiṣṭhāpanā Samiti** is described:

> **Ekante acitte dūre gūḍhe viśāle avirodhe | Uccārādityaagaḥ pratiṣṭhāpanikā bhavet samitiḥ || 15 ||**

> In a secluded place, free from the presence of non-observant people, far away, hidden, spacious, and free from obstacles, where people do not criticize or oppose, the act of discarding the bodily waste, such as urine and feces, is called the **Pratiṣṭhāpanā Samiti**.

**16.** Now, the nature of the **Indriyanirodha Vrata** is described:

> **Cakṣuḥ śrotraṁ ghraṇaṁ jihvā sparśaś ca indriyāṇi pañca | Svaka-svaka-viṣayebhyo nirodhayitavyā sadā muninā || 16 ||**

> The five senses, namely sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch, should always be restrained from their respective objects by the muni.

Page #45:
---------------------------
The **Mulachar** should always restrain the Sadhus from the objects of the senses, which are of two forms: words, smell, taste, touch (cold, hot, etc.). || 16 ||

Further, the nature of the **Chakshu Nirodha Vrat** is described: In the actions, forms, and color differences of the animate and inanimate, the abandonment of attachment, aversion, etc., is the **Chakshu Nirodha** of the Muni. || 17 ||

Meaning: The abandonment of attachment, aversion, etc., in the differences of actions like singing and dancing, differences of forms like square and rectangular, and differences of colors like white and black, in animate and inanimate objects, is the **Chakshu Nirodha** of the Muni. || 17 ||

Further, the nature of the **Shrotrendriya Nirodha Vrat** is described: The sounds of the animate like the seven notes (Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni) and the sounds of the inanimate like the Veena, etc., are the causes of attachment, aversion, etc., therefore, not listening to them is the **Shrotrendriya Nirodha**. || 18 ||

Further, the nature of the **Ghranendriya Nirodha Vrat** is described: The smells of the animate and inanimate, like the smell of flowers and perfumes, are pleasant and unpleasant, and are the causes of attachment, aversion, etc., therefore, not smelling them is the **Ghranendriya Nirodha** of the Muni. || 19 ||

Page #46:
---------------------------
##  Verse 19:

**The Restraint of the Nose:**

The essence of this restraint lies in the absence of attachment and aversion towards pleasant and unpleasant scents arising from both living and non-living beings.  For example, the scent of flowers, sandalwood, and other substances, which are caused by the karmic impressions of nature and the inherent qualities of the object. This restraint is the hallmark of a great sage, who remains unmoved by such sensory experiences.

## Verse 20:

**The Restraint of the Tongue:**

This restraint involves the complete detachment from the five tastes: bitter, pungent, astringent, sour, and sweet. It encompasses all types of food, including grains, milk, sweets, and spices.  The true essence of this restraint lies in accepting both desirable and undesirable food offered by others without any desire or aversion. This is known as the "Jihvajaya" (conquest of the tongue) vow.

## Verse 21:

**The Restraint of Touch:**

This restraint involves the complete detachment from the eight types of touch sensations arising from both living and non-living beings. These sensations include rough, smooth, hard, soft, cold, hot, light, and heavy.  The true essence of this restraint lies in accepting both pleasant and unpleasant touch sensations without any attachment or aversion. This is known as the "Sparshanirodha" (restraint of touch) vow.

Page #47:
---------------------------
The vow of restraint of the sense of touch is that which does not become faint in the touch that is the root of conduct or the form of suffering, that is, does not experience joy or sorrow. || 21 ||

Further, the names of the six essential duties of the ascetics are given: _Samada Thao Ya Vandana Padikkamaṇam Taheva Ṇadavvam. Paccakkhaṇam Visaggo Karaṇīyāvāsayā Chappi. || 22 ||_
Samata Stavashcha Vandana Pratikramaṇam Tathaiva Jñātavyaṃ. Pratyākyānaṃ Visargaḥ Karaṇīyā Āvaśyakāḥ Ṣadapi. || 22 ||
Meaning: Samayika, twenty-four stava, vandana, pratikramaṇa, pratyākhyāna, kayotsarga - these six are essential and should always be performed. || 22 ||

Further, the nature of the essential Samayika is explained: _Jīvidamaraṇe Lāhalābhaye Sanjoyavippaoge Ya. Bandhurisuhaddukkhādisu Samadā Sāmayikam Nāma. || 23 ||_
Jīvitamaraṇayoḥ Lābhālābhayoḥ Saṃyogaviprayoge Cha. Bandhvarisuhaduḥkhādiṣu Samatā Sāmayikam Nāma. || 23 ||
Meaning: Life, which is the form of holding the body, death, which is the separation of the life force - in both of these, and gain, which is the attainment of a desired object, loss, which is the non-attainment of a desired object, in this way, gain and loss in the attainment and non-attainment of food, equipment, etc.; in the union and separation of the pleasant and unpleasant; in both friends, relatives, etc., and enemies, wicked people, etc.; in happiness and sorrow, or in obstacles such as hunger, thirst, cold, heat, etc., the state of being free from attachment and aversion and having an equal outcome is called Samayika. || 23 ||

Further, the nature of the twenty-four stava is explained: _Ushaadijiṇavarāṇam Nāmaṇiruttiṃ Guṇāṇukittiṃ Cha. Kāuṇ Aciḍūṇ Ya Tisuddhapaṇamo Thao Ṇeo. || 24 ||_

##  Mūlagunādhikāra 1

**1.** The **Chaturviṁśatistava** is to be known as the praise that is done by explaining the etymology of the names of the twenty-four Tirthankaras beginning with Ṛṣabha, describing their extraordinary qualities, and offering obeisance with the purity of mind, speech, and body after worshipping their feet. **24.**

**11.** The **Mūlaguna** is the obeisance offered with the purity of mind, speech, and body, by bowing the head, without any action of the body, speech, or mind, to the Arhant, the Siddha, the Pratima, the Tapas, the Śruta, the Guna, the Guru, the Gurūṇ, and the Rādhikaguru, through the actions of body, speech, and mind, such as the practice of Kayotsarga and other Siddhabhakti, and Guru Bhakti. **25.**

**Further, the nature of Pratikramaṇa is described:**

**Pratikramaṇa** is the confession made with the purity of mind, speech, and body, for the transgression of the vows, in the form of thought, word, and deed, in any place, time, or state of being. **26.**

Page #49:
---------------------------
## Mulachara

**Verse 26:**

* **Translation:**  The investigation of offenses committed in the realm of substances (like food and body), in the realm of space (like dwelling and seating), in the realm of time (like morning), and in the realm of mental activity (like thoughts and intentions), is to be done through the auspicious mind, speech, and body. This means acknowledging one's own faults, revealing them openly, and seeking criticism from the Acharya and others. This is the quality of *pratikramana* for a Muni.

**Verse 27:**

* **Translation:**  The renunciation of six things - name, establishment, substance, space, time, and mental activity - through the three instruments (mind, speech, and body) for the future is known as *pratyakhyana*. This means to refrain from engaging in inappropriate actions, words, or thoughts in the future.

**Verse 28:**

* **Translation:**  *Kayotsarga* is the shedding of the body, performed at the designated time, with the mind focused on the qualities of the Jina, in accordance with the prescribed daily rituals.

Page #50:
---------------------------
##  Mūlagunādhikāra 1.

**13**

**28.**  The shedding of the body, with the contemplation of the fourfold virtues of compassion, forgiveness, right faith, and infinite knowledge, etc., while renouncing attachment to the body, is called *kāyoatsarga*, when expressed in terms of twenty-five, twenty-seven, or one hundred and eight breaths, etc., as the measure of time.

**29.**  Further, the nature of *keshaloncha* is described:

* *Biya tiyacharakkamase locho ukkassamajjhimajahaṇṇo. Sapadhikkamaṇe divasē uvavasēṇēva kāyavvo.*
* *Dvitrichatushkamase locah utkrishtmadhyamajaghanyaḥ. Sapratikramaṇe divasē upavasēnaiva kartavyah.*

**Meaning:**  The act of shaving one's own head, beard, and mustache, with the practice of *pratikramaṇa* and fasting, on a day after two, three, or four months, in the form of excellent, medium, or inferior, is called the *loncha* mūlaguna.

**Meaning:**  The monks do not possess even a single penny to pay for a barber, and they do not keep a razor, which is a weapon, because they understand that it causes violence.  They also do not get their hair cut by others because they do not engage in begging.  Therefore, they perform *keshaloncha* themselves, with *pratikramaṇa* and fasting, to renounce violence towards living beings like lice, fleas, etc.  This is the *loncha* mūlaguna.

**30.**  Further, the nature of *achelakapana* is described:

* *Vatthājina vakkeṇa ya ahava pattādina asanvaraṇam. Nigbhūsana niggantham achelakkaṁ jagadi pūjjam.*
* *Vastrājinavalkaiścha athavā patrādinā asanvaraṇam. Nirbhūṣaṇam nirgrathāṁ āchelakyaṁ jagati pūjyam.*

Page #51:
---------------------------
## Chapter 14: Fundamental Conduct

**Meaning:**  To not wear clothes made from cotton, silk, wool, animal hides, bark, or leaves, to not adorn oneself with ornaments like necklaces, and to abstain from substances that destroy self-control - this is the fundamental virtue of a Jain, free from external possessions like clothes, and similar to an ascetic.  || 30 || This prevents the accumulation of sins like violence, washing, and begging.

**Further, the nature of non-vow is described:**  The body, covered in dirt and grime, is a great virtue for the monk, a protector of self-control. || 31 ||  By abstaining from bathing, applying unguents, collyrium, drinking, eating, and applying sandalwood paste, the body becomes covered in dirt and grime, making this non-bathing a great virtue for the monk. || 31 ||

**Meaning:**  By abstaining from bathing, applying unguents, collyrium, drinking, eating, and applying sandalwood paste, the body becomes covered in dirt and grime. This non-bathing is a great virtue for the monk, protecting both the control of breath (pranayama) and the control of senses (indriyanigraha).  Someone might ask, "Doesn't not bathing lead to impurity?" The answer is that Jain monks are always pure due to their vows. If purity were achieved through bathing, then even fish, crocodiles, and immoral, unrestrained beings would be considered pure. This is not the case. Water and other such things are full of many faults, teeming with microscopic creatures, and are the root of sin. Therefore, it is appropriate for the restrained to follow the non-vow. || 31 ||

Page #52:
---------------------------
##  Translation:

**Mūlagunādhikāra 1.**

**32.**  Further, the nature of the Kṣitiśayana Vrata is described:  
On a secluded, sparsely covered, and unfrequented ground, lying down like a staff or a bow, with one side as a pillow, is called Kṣitiśayana. 

**Meaning:**  Lying down on a secluded, sparsely covered, and unfrequented ground, like a staff or a bow, with one side as a pillow, without any support for the body, without any bedding, and without any movement, is the Kṣitiśayana Mūlaguna.

**33.**  Further, the nature of the Adantamana Vrata is described:
Not cleaning the teeth with fingernails, pens, stones, bark, etc., is called Adantamana, which is the protection of restraint.

**Meaning:**  Not cleaning the teeth with fingernails, pens, stones, bark, etc., is the Adantamana Mūlaguna Vrata, which protects the restraint of the senses.

**34.**  Further, the nature of the Sthitibhojana Vrata is described:
Eating on a purified ground, with hands cupped like a bowl, without using any utensils, is called Sthitibhojana.

**Meaning:**  Eating on a purified ground, with hands cupped like a bowl, without using any utensils, is called Sthitibhojana.

**Mulaachararahit char angulke antarase samapad khade rahakara apane charanki bhoomi, jhootan padneki bhoomi, jimanevaleke pradesaki bhoomi - aisi teen bhoomiyonki shuddhatase aahar grahan karna vah sthitibhojan nama mulagun hai. || 34 ||**

Standing with a four-finger gap between the feet, free from Mulaachar, and consuming food with the purity of the three lands - the land of one's feet, the land where food is placed, and the land of the one who prepares it - this is the Mulaguna called Sthitibhojan. || 34 ||

**Aage ekbhaktka kharup kahate hain; Udayatthamane kale nalitiyavjjiyamhi majjhamhi. Ekamhi dua tie va muhuttakaleyabhattam tu. || 35 ||**

**Udayastamanayoḥ kālayoḥ nālitrikavarjite madhye. Ekasmin dvayoḥ triṣu vā muhūrtakāle ekabhaktan tu. || 35 ||**

Further, the form of Ekbhakt is described:  Eating once in a single Muhurta, two Muhurtas, or three Muhurtas, in the middle of the day, excluding the three Ghadi of sunrise and sunset. || 35 ||

**Arth - Suryake uday aur astakalaki teen ghadi chhodakar, va madhyakalamen ekmuhurt, do muhurt, tinmuhurt kalamen ekbar bhojan karna vah ekbhakt mulagun hai. || 35 ||**

Meaning - Eating once in a single Muhurta, two Muhurtas, or three Muhurtas, in the middle of the day, excluding the three Ghadi of sunrise and sunset, is the Mulaguna called Ekbhakt. || 35 ||

**Aage mulagunon ka phal varnan karate hain; Evam vihanajutte mulagune paliun tivihen. Houan jagadi pujjo akkhaysokkhan lahai mokkhan 36**

**Evam vidhānayuktan mulaguṇān palayitvā trividhena. Bhūtvā jagati pūjyaḥ akṣayasaukhyaṁ labhate mokṣam. || 36 ||**

Further, the fruits of the Mulagunas are described: By observing these Mulagunas with their prescribed rules, one becomes revered in all three worlds, attains eternal happiness, and achieves liberation. || 36 ||

**Arth - Is prakar purva kahe gaye vidhanakar yukt mulagunonko manavachan kayase. Jo palata hai vah tinlokam men pujya hokar avinaashi sukhavाले karmarahiт jivaki avastharup mokshako pata hai. || 36 ||**

Further, there are six Kālas of the Muni Rajas, out of which Ātmasanskāra Kāla, Sanllekhanā Kāla, and Uttamārtha Kāla, these three Kālas will be described in Ārādhanā, and the remaining three Kālas, namely Dīkshā Kāla, Shikshā Kāla, and Ganapōshanā Kāla, will be described in Āchār. Out of these, if the opportunity of death arises in the first three Kālas, then one should do this.

**Savvadukkhapphīṇāṇam Siddāṇam Arahado ṇamo. Saddhe Jiṇpaṇṇattṁ Pañchakkhāmi Ya Pāvayam || 37 ||**

**Sarvadukkhaprahīnebhyah Siddhebhyah Ahatyo Namah.

**Meaning:** Salutations to the Siddhas, the Supreme Beings, who are free from all suffering, and to the Ahatyas, who have attained all the perfections. I have faith in the teachings of the Jinas and I renounce all sins, which are the cause of suffering. || 37 ||

Further, for the sake of intense devotion, we offer salutations again: **ṇamotthu dhudpavāṇam Siddāṇam cha mahesiṇam. Santharṁ paḍivajāmi jaha kevali desiyam || 38 ||**

**Namostu Dhutpapāebhyah Siddhebhyah Cha Maharshibhyah.

## Mulachara

Now I obtain the inner layers of right faith, knowledge, conduct, and austerity, as well as the outer layers of earth, stone, tile, and grass (Santhara - seat), as the Kevalajnani have said. || 38 ||

The first verse indicates the promise to speak of renunciation, and the second verse indicates the promise to speak of the layers.

Further, the method of renunciation is stated for the sake of Samayik:

Whatever evil conduct there is, I renounce it all in three ways. I perform Samayik in three ways, all without form. || 39 ||

Meaning - I renounce all my sinful actions with my mind, speech, and body, and I perform all Samayik with equanimity, without discrimination and without fault, with my mind, speech, body, and by doing, causing to be done, and approving. || 39 ||

Further, it is said that I renounce all the causes of evil conduct with my mind, speech, and body:

I renounce all external and internal attachments, body, and food, with my mind, speech, and body in three ways. || 40 ||

Meaning - I renounce external possessions like fields (khet), false beliefs, etc.

Page #56:
---------------------------
## Brihatpratyakhyanasamstara, Adhikar 2:

I renounce, with mind, speech, and body, all internal and external possessions, food, and the body, etc.  I abandon attachment to them. || 40 ||

I renounce all killing of living beings, all false speech, all taking of what is not given, all sexual misconduct, and all possessions. || 41 ||

**Meaning:** I renounce all sins, including violence that results in the death of living beings, false speech, stealing, sexual misconduct, and all internal and external possessions. || 41 ||

Further, the nature of Samayika is described:

I have equanimity towards all beings, I have no animosity towards anyone. Abandoning all desires, I attain Samadhi. || 42 ||

**Meaning:** I have equanimity towards all beings, including enemies and friends. I have no animosity towards anyone. Therefore, abandoning all desires, I embrace the state of Samadhi. || 42 ||

Someone might ask, "How can there be no animosity?" The answer is:

I forgive all living beings, may all living beings forgive me. I have equanimity towards all beings, I have no animosity towards anyone. || 43 ||

Page #57:
---------------------------
## Mulachara

**Verse 43:**
*Kshame sarvajivaan sarve jiva kshamatam mama... Maitri me sarvabhutesshu vairan mama na kenapi.*
**Meaning:** I forgive all living beings, and may all living beings forgive me. I have friendship towards all beings, I have no animosity towards anyone.

**Verse 44:**
*Ragabandham padosan cha harisan dinabhavayam. Ussuggattam bhayam sogam radimaradin cha vosare.*
*Ragabandham pradvessam cha harsha dinabhavakam. Utsuktvam bhayam shokam ratimaratin cha vyutsrijami.*
**Meaning:** I abandon attachment, aversion, joy, compassion, begging, anxiety, fear, sorrow, attraction, and aversion to the unattainable. These are all the causes of animosity, therefore I abandon them all.

**Verse 45:**
*Mamattim parivajami nimmattimuvahidho. Alambanam cha me ada avasesai vosare.*
*Mamatam parivarjayami nirmamtavmupastthita. Alambanam cha me atma avaseshani vyutsrijami.*
**Meaning:** I abandon possessiveness, I am established in non-possessiveness. I abandon my attachment to the self and all other attachments.

Page #58:
---------------------------
I have attained the state of **Brihatpratyakhyana** (complete renunciation) as described in **Adhikar 2.21** (excluding **Rahit**). My **Atma** (soul) is my only support, I renounce everything else. This means I renounce everything except the infinite **Jnana** (knowledge), **Ratnatraya** (three jewels), and other qualities of the **Atma**. || 45 ||

Someone might ask, "You have renounced everything, but why not your **Atma**?" To this, I reply:

My **Atma** is in my **Jnana** (knowledge), my **Atma** is in my **Darshan** (faith and illumination), my **Atma** is in my **Charitra** (conduct free from sinful actions), my **Atma** is in my **Pratyakhyana** (renunciation), my **Atma** is in my **Samvara** (restriction of inflow of karmic matter), and my **Atma** is in my **Yoga** (right conduct). How can I renounce my **Atma**? It is impossible. || 46 ||

Someone might still argue, "This living being dies alone, and this conscious being is born alone. This individual alone experiences birth and death, and when free from karmic matter..." || 47 ||

## Fundamental Conduct

When it happens, only the individual becomes liberated (freed). The meaning is that this being is alone in all times and all states. ||47||

**Eko me sassado appa naanadansanalakkhano. Sesaa me bahira bhavaa savve sanjogalakkhanaa.** ||48||

**Eko me shaashvata aatmaa jnaanadarshanalakshanaha. Seshaa me baahya bhavaah sarve sanjogalakshanaah.** ||48||

Meaning: The one, my soul, characterized by knowledge and perception, is eternal. The rest, like the body, are external objects, born from the connection with the soul, and therefore perishable. ||48||

Further, it is said that why should one renounce the state characterized by connection? The answer is given:

**Sanjoyamulaa jiveena pattaa dukkhaparampraa. Tamhaa sanjogasambandham savvam tiviheena vosare.** ||49||

**Sanjoyamulaa jiveena praapta duhkhaparampraa. Tasmaat sanjogasambandham sarvam trividhena vyutsrijami.** ||49||

Meaning: Due to the connection with external objects, this being has always experienced suffering. Therefore, I renounce all connections through mind, speech, and body - these three. ||49||

Further, for the renunciation of evil conduct, it is said:

**Mulaguna uttaragune jo me naaraadhidoo pamadeena. Tamaham savvam ninde padikkama agamissanaam.** ||50||

## Chapter 2: Detailed Renunciation

**Verse 50:**
I condemn all the faults of the *Mulaguna* (primary qualities) and *Uttaraguna* (secondary qualities) that I have not worshipped due to negligence. I also condemn and renounce the faults of those qualities that I will not worship in the future.

**Verse 51:**
I condemn and denounce all the faults of *Asanjam* (lack of self-control), *Agnana* (ignorance), *Mithyatva* (false belief), and *Mamata* (attachment) in both living beings (*Jiva*) and non-living beings (*Ajiva*).

**Verse 52:**
If someone asks, "You have renounced the faults committed due to negligence, but why not the negligence itself?" The answer is: I condemn and denounce the eight *Atikrama* (transgressions), the four *Garava* (pride), and the thirty-three *Asana* (faults).

Page #61:
---------------------------
The English translation preserving the Jain terms is as follows:

The seven Mūlācāra fears, the eight Madas, the four Saṃjñās, and the three Gauravās. The thirty-three Āsādanās, Rāga and Dveṣa are to be avoided. 

The seven fears are: fear of this world, fear of the next world, fear of lack of protection, fear of sudden death, fear of bodily pain, fear of sudden calamities like thunderstorms, and fear of loss of psychic powers. The eight Madas are: pride in knowledge, pride in wealth and power, pride in commands being obeyed, pride in noble lineage, pride in physical strength, pride in austerities, pride in beauty, and pride in maternal lineage. The four Saṃjñās are the desires for food, sex, possessions, and life. The three Gauravās are the pride in the experience of happiness, the pride in the experience of rasa (aesthetic delight), and the pride in the experience of physical comfort.

Page #62:
---------------------------
## Chapter 2: Detailed Refutation of Pride

**Verse 53:** There are eight types of pride that arise from the delusion of superiority based on lineage, wealth, etc. These eight should be abandoned because they hinder right faith and conduct.

**Verse 54:** The thirty-three objects of contemplation are: five *astikayas* (categories of existence), six *jivanikayas* (categories of life), five *mahavratas* (great vows), five *samitis* (observances), and three *guptis* (secrecies). These thirty-three objects are also the objects of *asadana* (misinterpretation). To misinterpret the nature of these objects, to raise doubts, etc., is called *asadana*. This leads to faults and should be abandoned.

**Verse 55:**  "I condemn what is condemnable, and I criticize what is criticizable. I examine everything, both internal and external, with all its limitations."

Page #63:
---------------------------
## 26
## Mulachara

**Meaning:** I condemn the faults that are worthy of condemnation, which manifest in my own nature. That is, I remember that I committed these faults and I refrain from them. I confess my faults to the Acharya and others, and I criticize (abandon) all internal attachment and external conscious and unconscious possessions. || 55 ||

**How to criticize:** Just as a child, without understanding the consequences, speaks truthfully about what is right and wrong, so too should one criticize, abandoning deception and falsehood. || 56 ||

**Meaning:** Just as a child, without understanding the consequences, speaks truthfully about what is right and wrong, so too should one criticize, abandoning deception and falsehood. || 56 ||

**Further, it is said that the Acharya to whom one should confess their faults should possess these qualities:** The Acharya should be unshakeable in knowledge, vision, austerity, and conduct. He should be patient, skilled in the scriptures, a good listener, and a keeper of secrets. || 57 ||

**Meaning:** The Acharya should be unshakeable in knowledge, vision, austerity, and conduct. He should be patient, skilled in the scriptures, a good listener, and a keeper of secrets. || 57 ||

Page #64:
---------------------------
In the Brihatpratyakhyanasamstara, Adhikara 2.27, regarding conduct and behavior, an Acharya should be steadfast (firm) in all four forms of worship, possess the virtue of patience, be astute in the teachings of both his own and others' scriptures, and not reveal confidential matters discussed in private. One should approach such an Acharya for criticism. || 57 ||

Further, the text describes the method of seeking forgiveness after criticism: "Whatever I have spoken out of attachment, aversion, or ignorance, I forgive it all." || 58 ||

Meaning: "Whatever I have done out of attachment, aversion, or ignorance, that is, whatever inappropriate behavior I have exhibited towards you, and whatever I have spoken inappropriately out of carelessness, I seek forgiveness from all beings, and I forgive all beings. I am content with all beings." || 58 ||

Regarding the death of such forgiving, renunciant Acharyas who desire to attain liberation, the text states: "There are three types of death: the death of the ignorant, the death of the learned, and the death of the liberated." || 59 ||

**Chapter 2.29 of the Brihatpratyakhyanasamstara**

**Verse 61:**
At the time of death, those who abandon *samyaktva* (right faith) or die with *artaroudra* (violent emotions) are born in the lower realms of the gods, such as *bhavanavasi* (dwellers in mansions). The attainment of *samyaktva* or the *ratnatraya* (three jewels) is rare, as stated in the scriptures. Such beings wander through the four realms of existence in the future, and their cycle of rebirth becomes endless.

**Verse 62:**
The *kshapika* (disciple) asks: "What are the *devadurgati* (lower realms of the gods)? What is the nature of *bodhi* (enlightenment)? Why is death not understood? And why does this being wander through the endless cycle of rebirth?"

**Verse 63:**
The *acharya* (teacher) replies: "The *kaandarpmaabhiyogya* (attachment to sensual pleasures), *kailvisya* (greed), *sammoha* (delusion), and *asuratva* (demonic nature) are the causes of *devadurgati* (lower realms of the gods) for those who abandon *samyaktva* (right faith) at the time of death."

## 30
## Mulachara
**Meaning:** At the time of death, due to the destruction of Samyaktva, there are five devadurgatis: Kandarpa, Abhiyoga, Kilvisha, Kamoha, and Asura. Their nature is as follows: The result of the disturbance in the virtuous qualities is called Kandarpa, the desire for things like rasa, mantra, etc. is Abhiyoga, unfavorable conduct is Kilvisha, being engrossed in false beliefs is called Sammoha, and one whose conduct is accompanied by a fierce result is Asura. Their religions are called gatis. || 63 ||

**Now, the nature of the Kandarpa devadurgati is described:**
One who speaks falsely, teaches falsehood to many beings, and engages in Kandarpa with intense passion, is born as a naked ascetic in the Kandarpa devas due to the karma of Kandarpa. || 64 ||

**Further, the nature of Abhiyoga karma and the place of birth from it is described:**
One who covets many things, desires wealth, and enjoys many pleasures, is born in the Vaahanas due to the karma of Abhiyoga. || 65 ||

Page #68:

## Chapter 2.31 of the Brihatpratyakhyana:

**Verse 65:**

The virtuous one who is attached to taste, etc., and performs many actions like mantras, etc., and speaks much, such as humorous stories, etc., is born as a deity in the form of an elephant, horse, etc., of the vehicle class, along with the karma of accusation.

**Verse 66:**

The one who is opposed to the Tirthankaras, the Sangha, the Caitya, and the Sutra, who is unrefined and degraded, is born among the Kilvisha deities.

**Meaning:**

The virtuous one who is against the Tirthankaras who propagate the Dharma, and does not follow the rules of the Sangha, which consists of four types: Rishi Yati Muni Anagara (ascetics), Rishi Shravaka Aryika Shravaka (lay followers), and Samyag Darshan Jnana Charitra Tap (right faith, knowledge, conduct, and austerity), and is arrogant, does not follow the rules of the omniscient deity's image, the twelve-limbed scriptures, and the fourteen previous forms of the scriptures, and is clever in deceiving through magic, is born among the Kilvisha deities who are musicians.

## Chapter 2.33: The Great Renunciation

**Verse 69:**

Those beings who are deeply engrossed in the wrong view (mithyadarshan), who have the nidana of future aspirations, and who are stained with the black karma (krishna leshya) that leads to cruel results, when they die, their attainment of enlightenment (bodhi) is rare.

**Verse 70:**

Those beings who are deeply engrossed in the right view (samyagdarshan), who are free from the nidana of desires for worldly pleasures, and who are stained with the white karma (shukla leshya) that leads to auspicious results, when they die, their attainment of enlightenment (bodhi) is easy.

**Verse 71:**

Those who are opposed to their teachers (guru), who are full of delusion (moha), who are strong in their wrong conduct (kushila), and who die without mindfulness (samadhi), they become bound to endless cycles of rebirth (anantasansara).

Page #71:
---------------------------
Those who are bound by the **Mulachara** (observance of vows) and are afflicted with **Mithyatva** (false belief) die with **Aarta** (painful) and **Roudra** (violent) consequences, and thus have a long cycle of rebirth. || 71 ||

Further, the nature of those with a short cycle of rebirth is explained: Those who are devoted to the words of the **Jinas** and follow the teachings of their **Gurus** with devotion, who are weak and unattached, are those who have a short cycle of rebirth. || 72 ||

Meaning: Those who are truly devoted to the teachings of the **Arhats**, who follow the commands of their **Acharyas** and other **Gurus** with devotion, not just out of a desire to learn **Mantras**, **Tantras**, and scriptures, who are free from **Mithyatva** and have pure **Parinaamas** (consequences) free from **Kleshas** (afflictions), are those who have a short cycle of rebirth. || 72 ||

Further, it is explained what happens to those who are not devoted to the words of the **Jinas**: Those who do not know the teachings of the **Jinas** die many times as children, experiencing many untimely and unwanted deaths. || 73 ||

Meaning: Those who do not know the **Agamas** of the **Jinas** (the omniscient ones) are orphans who die many times as children, experiencing false deaths due to **Mithyadristi** (false belief) and ignorance, and they experience many unwanted deaths. || 73 ||

Further, it is asked how these child deaths occur, and it is explained: **Saththaggahanam** (taking poison), **Visabhakhanam** (eating poisonous food), **Jalanam** (burning), and **Jalappaveso** (drowning).

*Śastragṛahaṇaṃ viṣabhakhanaṃ ca jvalanaṃ jalapraveśaś ca. Anācārabaṇḍasevī janmamaraṇānubandhīnaḥ.*

**Meaning:**

Death caused by weapons (like swords), poison, fire, drowning in rivers, wells, or ponds, and death caused by the consumption of objects that are against the principles of right conduct, are all forms of death that are connected to the cycle of birth and death (saṃsāra). These deaths are not suitable for those who follow the right conduct.

**Verse 75:**

*Uḍamadho tiriyamidu kadāṇi bālamaraṇāṇi bahugāṇi. Daśaṇṇāṇasahagado paṇḍiyamaraṇaṃ aṇumarisse.*

*Ūrdhvamdhastīryakṣu tu kṛtāni bālamaraṇāni bahukāni. Darśanajñānasahgataḥ paṇḍitamaraṇaṃ anumariṣyāmi.*

**Meaning:**

I have experienced many deaths in the past, both in the heavenly realms (ūrdhvaloka), the hellish realms (adholoka), and the animal realms (tiryagloka). Now, with the knowledge of the true nature of reality (darśana) and the right conduct (jñāna), I will embrace the death of a wise person (paṇḍitamaraṇa), which is the liberation from the cycle of birth and death through the practice of non-violence and right conduct.

**Verse 76:**

*Uvvayamaraṇaṃ jādimaraṇaṃ ṇiraesu vedanāo ya. . Edāṇi sambharanto paṇḍiyamaraṇaṃ aṇumarisse.*

**Meaning:**

Remembering the deaths caused by greed (uvyayamaraṇa) and the deaths caused by hatred (jādimaraṇa), which are filled with suffering (vedanā), I will now embrace the death of a wise person (paṇḍiyamaraṇa) with full awareness and preparation.

Page #73:

## Chapter 2: The Extensive Refutation of the Doctrine of Authority

**37**

"Having wandered through the cycle of birth and death, in the form of the four paths, and having experienced the suffering of birth, aging, and death, what suffering have I not experienced? I have experienced much suffering." (78)

"Further, I will explain the various kinds of suffering I have experienced in this cycle of existence. I have consumed many kinds of *pudgalas* in this cycle of existence, both in the form of food and in the form of their transformations, but I have never been satisfied." (79)

**Meaning:** "While wandering through the cycle of birth and death, in the form of the four paths, I have consumed many *pudgalas* such as curd, sugar, jaggery, rice, water, etc., both in the form of food and in the form of their transformations, such as feces and urine, but I have never been satisfied. My desire has only increased." (79)

"Further, I will explain with an example why I have never been satisfied. Just as fire is not satisfied by adding more fuel, and the salt ocean is not filled by thousands of rivers, including the Ganges and the Indus, similarly, this living being cannot be satisfied by the objects of desire, such as food, women, and clothes." (80)

One who is not content with basic necessities, his greed increases with more possessions. || 80 ||
Further, it is said that bondage occurs only due to the result: _"The one who is contaminated by desires, intoxicated by sensual pleasures, even though he does not enjoy them, becomes bound by the result."_ || 81 ||
Meaning: The being who is desirous of sensual pleasures, afflicted by the impurities of attachment and aversion, and intoxicated by sensual pleasures, even though he does not enjoy them, becomes bound by the karmas due to the mental activity, which is the result. || 81 ||
Further, it is said that even without enjoying, sin-bondage occurs merely by desire: _"It is said that fish go to the seventh hell due to the cause of food. Food with mental attachment is not considered proper, even if one begs for it with the mind."_ || 82 ||
Meaning: It is said in the scriptures that due to the cause of food, the _tandal_ fish goes to the seventh hell due to the defects of the mind. Therefore, food obtained by killing a living being, which is accompanied by mental attachment, is not considered proper, even if one begs for it with the mind. || 82 ||
Further, the Acharya tells Kshatrapa that if one consumes food with faults...

## Translation:

**Chapter 2.39 of the Brihatpratyakhyanasamstara**

If your mind is not fit to contemplate, then you should only engage in pure conduct. 

**Verse 83:**

*Previously, you had the intention of performing austerities, but you did not follow through. Now, with your mind and intellect, you should accept death with the impurities of the kṣayās (passions) still present.*

**Meaning:** O क्षपक (Kṣapaka), you should have previously performed austerities and renounced the desire for happiness in this world and the next. Now, with direct and indirect (inferential) knowledge, you should firmly believe in the Āgama (scripture), abandon the kṣayās, and practice the conduct of Samadhi-death with forgiveness.

**Verse 84:**

*Even those who have practiced for a long time, when they reach the time of death, fall back due to the weight of their past karma.*

**Meaning:** O क्षपक (Kṣapaka), understand that even those who have practiced for a long time, when they reach the time of death, fall back due to the weight of their past karma. They are deprived of the three jewels (Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct). Therefore, be careful.

**Verse 85:**

*Therefore, a person who is diligent and has the intention of attaining liberation should be free from the kṣayās.*

**Meaning:** Therefore, a person who is diligent and has the intention of attaining liberation should be free from the kṣayās.

## The Soul Possessing Inherent Qualities is Obligated to Follow the Path of Liberation. || 85 ||

**Meaning:** Just as a man striving to achieve something like the piercing of the moon does not destroy his qualities, but remains vigilant, similarly, a soul striving for the path of liberation, which is characterized by right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, does not destroy its qualities. Be certain of this. || 85 ||

**Further, it is explained what the moon-piercer did:**

**Kanakalata, Nagalata, Vidhyullata, and Kundalata, as well as Sagarak, Ballabhak, Kuladatta, and Vardhamanak, were all killed by Mahendradatt in Mithila, in a single day. || 86 ||**

**Meaning:** Mahendradatt killed the women Kanakalata, Nagalata, Vidhyullata, and Kundalata, as well as the men Sagarak, Ballabhak, Kuladatta, and Vardhamanak, all in one day in the city of Mithila. Therefore, a Yati should strive diligently during the time of Samadhi-maran (death in meditation) for the sake of ultimate truth. || 86 ||

**Further, it is said that just as worldly affairs are ruined without effort, so too is the ultimate truth of a Yati ruined without effort:**

**Where there is no effort, there is no success, and the path of liberation is filled with obstacles. The city of liberation is filled with obstacles, and the root of pride is the cause of downfall. || 88 ||**

## Chapter 2.41 of the Brihatpratyakhyanasamstara:

**Verse 88:**

Just as a ship laden with precious jewels, though near the port and the city, sinks in the ocean due to the negligence of the boatman, similarly, a renunciant, though near the city of liberation, filled with the jewels of right faith and other virtues, sinks in the ocean of samsara due to negligence and lack of guidance from the renunciant teachers. Therefore, one should strive diligently.

**Verse 89:**

**Question:** What should one do when one lacks the ability to perform external practices like the absence of space and time?

**Answer:**  O renunciant, even without external practices, one should be absorbed in the meditation of internal transformation. In the right time and place, one should abandon the body, free from delusion and attachment.

**Verse 90:**

**Question:** What is the benefit of abandoning the body in this way?

**Answer:** By cutting off the roots of attachment and aversion, and by destroying the eight karmas, one breaks free from the cycle of birth and death and attains liberation.

## Translation:

**Verse 90:**

By destroying the root of attachment and aversion, and severing the chain of eight karmas, you will break free from the cycle of birth and death and attain liberation from the world. This is the fruit of renunciation, know this.

**Verse 91:**

Kshapaka says, "I believe in this teaching, which is spoken by the Jinas, with my body, speech, and mind. This teaching is the essence of the path to liberation, and it brings welfare to all beings, both mobile and immobile."

**Verse 92:**

"O Kshapaka! Even with a strong and capable mind, it is not possible to contemplate all twelve categories of scriptures at the time of death."

Page #80:

## Brihatpratyakhyanasamstara, Adhikara 2.43:

The entire Shruta Skandha, with its body strength and mental strength, cannot be comprehended by the ascetics, meaning neither its meaning can be understood nor can it be recited. || 92 ||

Further, it is said, "What should be done then?" 

In the first step, the one who is filled with enthusiasm on the path of liberation from attachment, he should not be abandoned even at the time of death. || 93 ||

In the second step, the one who is filled with enthusiasm on the path of liberation from attachment, he should not be abandoned even at the time of death. || 93 ||

Meaning: O क्षपक! The one who feels enthusiasm in a single word like "Namohadbhava" from the omniscient's teachings, or in another word like "Namah Siddhebhyah", or in a word of meaning, a word of scripture, a word of evidence, a word of five prostrations, or even in a single seed word, attains the highest state. Therefore, even when the breath is in the throat, one should not abandon the contemplation of the word. || 93 ||

Further, the reason for not abandoning the word is explained:

From this, even a single verse, at the time of death, contemplated with devotion, makes one a devotee. || 94 ||

Meaning: O क्षपक! The one who contemplates even a single verse from this Shruta Skandha or from the five prostrations mantra, along with the devotion of right faith, etc., at the time of death, becomes a devotee, a jewel...

**Mulachar**
Therefore, you should not abandon the refuge of the Jinavachan, which is free from the three impurities. || 94 ||

**Further, what is the medicine that is given when there is pain at the time of death?**
**Jinavayanamosahaminam visayasuhviraeyanam amidbhootam. Jaramarana vahiveyanam khaykaranam savvadukkhaanam.** || 95 ||
**Jinavachanamoshadhamidam visayasukhavirechanam amritabhootam. Jaramarana vyadhivedanaanam kshayakaranam sarvadukkhaanam.** || 95 ||
**Meaning:** This Jinavachan is the medicine, which is a purgative (remover) of the sensual pleasures generated by the senses, is the form of nectar, and is the destroyer of all sorrows like old age, death, disease, and pain. 
**Implication:** Just as medicine removes diseases, so too does the Jinavani remove the sorrows of birth and death, and leads to the attainment of the immortal state. Therefore, the Jinavachan is the nectar-like medicine. || 95 ||

**Further, they tell what the refuge is at that time:**
**Naanam saranam meram dansanasaranam cha chariyasaranam cha. Tava sanjamam cha saranam bhagavan sarano mahaviro.** || 96 ||
**Gnanam saranam mama darshanasaranam cha charitrasaranam cha. Tapa sanjamachcha saranam bhagavan sarano mahaviro.** || 96 ||
**Meaning:** O क्षपक, you should have this feeling, that my true knowledge is the refuge (helper), the right view, which is the manifestation of the calming emotions, compassion, and faith, is the refuge, the conduct is the refuge, the austerity and restraint are the refuge, the Lord Mahavir is the refuge. || 96 ||

Page #82:
---------------------------
The fourfold path of conduct, which is the form of non-violence, is my refuge. The twelve types of austerities and the control of the senses and life force are my refuge. And the infinite knowledge, happiness, and other virtues, along with the teachings of the great Lord Mahavira, are my refuge.  Except for these, I have no other refuge, such as the gods and others. || 96 ||

Further, the fruits of worship are called "Aaraahana".  By performing the right actions at the right time, one attains the three excellent births and then attains liberation. || 97 ||

Meaning: The muni who has performed the fourfold path of worship, including right faith, and who has lived a life free from transgressions, attains the three excellent births after a good death and then attains liberation (moksha). || 97 ||

Hearing this, the क्षपक, desiring to understand the cause and effect, says: "I am a श्रमण, and I am restrained in all ways. I renounce everything. This is what I have said in summary." || 98 ||

Meaning: The क्षपक thinks, "First, I am a श्रमण, meaning I am one who is united with all beings. Second, I am restrained in all ways. Therefore, I renounce all unworthy thoughts and actions." This is how he summarizes his critique. || 98 ||

**English Translation:**

**Verse 46**

The fundamental principles further reveal the firm results: I have obtained the **Jina**'s words, which are like nectar, though I had not obtained them before. Having embraced the path of liberation, I do not fear death.

**Meaning:** The commentator reflects that I have obtained the **Jina**'s words, which are not contradicted by any evidence and are the cause of happiness, even though I had not obtained them before. I have also embraced the path of liberation. Now I do not fear death.

**Implied Meaning:** As long as there was ignorance, the true nature was not known, therefore there was fear of death. Now, having grasped the true nature through the **Jina**'s words and having embarked on the path of liberation, the fear of death has vanished.

**Verse 100**

Even the courageous must die, and the cowardly must also die. If one must die in either case, it is better to die with courage.

**Meaning:** The commentator reflects that the courageous (firm-minded) will also die, and the cowardly will also inevitably die. If one must die in both cases, it is better to die with courage (free from afflictions), as cowardice increases the bondage of sin. Therefore, one should not be cowardly at the time of death.

**Verse 101**

Even the virtuous must die, and the non-virtuous must also die. If one must die in either case, it is better to die with virtue.

Page #84:
---------------------------
##  **Translation:**

**Chapter 2.47 of the Brihatpratyakhyanasamstara**

**Verse 101:**

Even those who are virtuous (observing vows) will die, and those who abandon their vows due to fear of death from hunger, thirst, etc., will also inevitably die when their time comes. If death is inevitable in both cases, it is better to die while being virtuous. Abandoning vows will lead to more karmic bondage, and death is inevitable anyway. Therefore, it is said that dying while being virtuous is superior.

**Verse 102:**

A monk who has practiced celibacy for a long time, by destroying the remaining karmas like knowledge-obscuring karmas, gradually attains pure results, or progresses through the stages of virtues, and by destroying countless karmic stains, becomes free from karmic blemishes and attains the state of pure knowledge, etc., and ultimately reaches liberation. This is the way of worship.

**Verse 103:**

One who is free from attachment, ego, impurities, has conquered the senses, is patient, free from attachment to the world, and has right vision, is a true worshiper even while dying.

Page #85:
---------------------------
## Mulachara

**Meaning:** One who is about to die, free from attachment (moha) to both animate and inanimate objects, devoid of pride, free from passions like anger, etc., with controlled senses, indifferent to worldly pleasures and immersed in transcendental bliss, possessing courage, not weak, free from desire for worldly enjoyments, and well-established in right faith (samyagdarshan). Such a being can become a devotee. || 103 ||

Further supporting this point:

**"Nikkasaayaras Dantasas Soorasas Vavasayino. Sansarabhayabhidassas Pacchakkhanam Suham Have." || 104 ||**

**"Nishkashāyasya Dantasya Shūrasya Vyavsayinaḥ. Samsarabhayabhītasya Pratyākyānam Sukham Bhavet." || 104 ||**

**Meaning:** Such a Muni (sage) is the cause of happiness in devotion - one who is free from passions, controls the senses, is courageous and not cowardly, is diligent in conduct, immersed in it, and is afraid of the fear of the world, knowing the nature of the suffering in the four realms of existence. Such a being, about to die, can become a devotee of devotion. || 104 ||

## 48

Now, summarizing the statement, the fruit of devotion is described:

**"Edam Panchakhanam Jo Kahadi Maranadesayalammi. Dhiro Amudhasanno So Gacchai Uttamam Thanam." || 105 ||**

**"Etat Pratyākyānam Yaḥ Kuryāt Maraṇadeśakāle. Dhīro Amūḍhasañjñaḥ Sa Gacchati Uttamam Sthānam." || 105 ||**

**Meaning:** The Muni, at the time of death, with patience, not desiring food, etc. (not wanting food, etc.), such a wise and clear-minded one goes to the highest abode. || 105 ||

Page #86:

## Brihatpratyakhyanasamstara, Adhikara 2.19

**105.** The one who performs **pratyakhyana** attains **moksha-sthana**. This is the meaning of knowing that the fruit of **aradhana** is **nirvana**.

**106.** **Viro jaramarana-ripu, viro vijnan-jnana-sampanna, lokasya udyota-karo jinavara-chando disatu bodhim.**

Artham-If there is doubt about my life in this place and time, then this renunciation is so that as long as the adversity lasts, I will abstain from food and drink. After the adversity is over, if I am still alive, then I will break the fast.|| 112 ||

**Abstention from Attachment (Samkṣepapratyākhyānādhikāra) 3**

I renounce all external and internal attachments, as well as the sinful actions of mind, speech, and body. || 113 ||

Further, the highest form of renunciation is called "Uttāmārtha Tyāga," which is the abandonment of all internal and external attachments, including food, body, and life itself. || 114 ||

Meaning: I renounce all my internal and external attachments, as well as all four types of food, and my body, for as long as I live. This is the highest form of renunciation. || 114 ||

Further, one who is filled with joy upon seeing the glory of the Agamas, should offer salutations in this way: "May the Jina-śāsana, which is the refuge of all beings, and in which all beings who are immersed in it cross the endless ocean of the cycle of births and deaths, prosper for a long time." || 115 ||

Further, regarding the fruits of worship, it is said: "The path of the Arihantas is the path of liberation."

Page #91:
---------------------------
## 54

**Verse 116:**

May the path of the Arhats, the path of the Siddhas, the path of those who have overcome attachment, be mine always. This is the fruit of my worship, nothing else.

**Verse 117:**

One wise death cuts through hundreds of births. One should die such a death that it is considered a good death, meaning one does not have to take birth again.

**Verse 118:**

If a being attains the death of Samadhi in one lifespan, then they will surely attain the supreme liberation after seven or eight lifespans.

This is said for those who are in the state of Bhavalingi.

The suffering of birth and death arises from the existence of a body.

Page #92:
---------------------------
## Abbreviated Renunciation Authority 3 |

Therefore, samadhi is called the abandonment of this body, which is death-bringing:

**55**
There is no fear equal to death, nor is there any suffering equal to birth. Cut off the attachment to the body from birth and death. || 119 ||

**Meaning:** There is no fear equal to death for this being, and there is no suffering equal to birth. Therefore, cut off the great disease of birth and death. The root cause of this disease is attachment to the body. Therefore, by renouncing attachment, which is the method of renunciation, the great disease of birth and death is eradicated. || 119 ||

It is said that the three pratikramas mentioned in the worship can be performed in this abbreviated time:

The first is the pratikrama of all transgressions, the second is the threefold pratikrama, and the third is the pratikrama for the highest good. || 120 ||

**Meaning:** The first is the pratikrama of all transgressions, meaning the purification of all faults committed from the time of initiation until the end of all austerities. The second is the threefold pratikrama, which is the purification of transgressions committed in the abandonment of three types of food without water. The third is the pratikrama for the highest good, in which life -

---------------------------
## Mulachar

**56. To renounce the attachment to water and other things until the age of 56 is to purify oneself from one's faults. This is the Pratikraman that leads to liberation.** || 120 ||

**Further, the Pratikraman of the senses, body, passions, hands, and feet has been described. The five senses, speech, hands, feet, and mind, along with the body, are described as the ten Mundas.** || 121 ||

**Meaning:** The Mundana of the five senses means to renounce the activities of the senses in their respective objects. For example, to stop the activity of the sense of touch is the Mundana of the sense of touch. Similarly, not speaking without reason or purpose is the Mundana of speech, not engaging in improper actions with the hands is the Mundana of the hands, not moving the feet in an improper way is the Mundana of the feet, not having evil thoughts in the mind is the Mundana of the mind, and not engaging in improper actions with the body is the Mundana of the body. In this way, the ten Mundanas are described in the Jinaagama. || 121 ||

**Thus, the third chapter of the Mulachar, composed by Acharya Shri Vattkeeri, titled "Pratikyanana", ends here.** || 3 ||

## Samaacharaadhikaara 4.

**Samaacharaadhikaara || 4 ||**

**57**

Further, when the life force remains, the fourth Samaachara named Aadhkaara, which explains the nature of one who practices his original virtues without any transgression, is said with salutations:

**"I will speak the Samaachara in brief, in due order, after saluting the Triloka-pujjanee Arhats."** || 122 ||

**"Triloka-pujjaneean Arhatan vanditvaa trividhena. Vaksye samaachaaram samaasata aanupoorvyaa."** || 122 ||

**Meaning:** After saluting the Arhat Bhagwan, who is worthy of being worshipped by the Asuras, humans, and Devas, with body, speech, and mind, I (Vattkeeri) will speak the Samaacharaadhikaara in brief, in due order. || 122 ||

Further, the word Samaachara is explained in four ways:

**"Samataa samaachaaro samyagaachaaro samo va aachaaro. Savvesim hi samaanam samaachaaro du aachaaro."** || 123 ||

**"Samataa samaachaarah samyagaachaarah samo va aachaarah. Sarvesham hi samaanaam samaachaarastu aachaarah."** || 123 ||

**Meaning:** The state of equality, which is the absence of attachment and aversion, is Samaachara. Or, the practice of original virtues without any transgression, which is Samyak, is Samaachara. Or, the common conduct of all the Munis, which is non-violence, etc., is Samaachara. Or, the conduct which results in similar outcomes in all fields, such as the renunciation of the body, etc., without any harm or increase, is Samaachara. || 123 ||

Now the types of Samachar are explained:

**Duviho Samacharo Ogoviya Padavibhagiyo Cheva. Dasha Ogo Bhanio Anegaha Padavibhagi Ya 124 Dvividha Samachar Audhika: Padavibhagika Schiva. Fear Fast Bhanit Anekadha Padavibhagi Cha. || 124 ||**

**Meaning:** Samachar, meaning right conduct, is of two types: Audhika and Padavibhagika. Audhika has ten types, and Padavibhagika Samachar is of many kinds. || 124 ||

**58**

**Audhika Samachar ke Dasha Bhed Kahte Hain; Ichchamichchakarou Thadhakarou Ya Asiya Nisithi. Apushcha Padipushcha Chhandan Sanimantana Ya Upasampa 125 Ichchamithyakarou Tathakarah Cha Asika Nishedhika. Apushcha Pratipushcha Chhandanam Sanimantrana Cha Upasampat. || 125 ||**

**Meaning:** Ichchakar, Mithyakar, Tathakar, Asika, Nishedhika, Apushcha, Pratipushcha, Chhandan, Sanimantrana, and Upasampat - these ten are the types of Audhika Samachar. || 125 ||

**Further, their subject matter is explained in three stanzas:**

**Itthe Ichchakarou Michchakarou Tahev Avradhe. Pudisu Nandmi Tahanti Ya Niggamane Asiya Bhania. Pavisante Anishi Apushchanya Sakajjarambhe. Sadhammana Ya Guruna Puvyanishihimi Padipushcha 127 Chhandan Gahide Davve Agivve Nimantana Bhanida. Tumahaatti Gurukule Adanissaggo Du Uvasampa. || 128 ||**

## Chapter 4: The Right to Ask

**How to ask the Guru:**

This is how one should ask the Guru: "With the grace of your feet, I wish to go to another place to learn from another Acharya." One should ask three, five, or six times. This shows enthusiasm and humility. (146)

**Leaving with the Guru's Permission:**

Having asked in this way, one should be released by one's own Guru. Then, one should leave with three, two, or one other monk. It is not appropriate to go alone. (147)

**Why one should not go alone:**

The reason for not going alone is explained: The first type of journey is by one who has understood the true nature of the soul and the world. The second type of journey is by one who is still attached to worldly desires. The third type of journey is by one who is alone. This third type of journey is not permitted by the Jinas. (148)

Page #106:
---------------------------
**Translation:**

**News Rights 4.**  
When one engages in solitary wandering, there are many faults associated with it, such as the slander of the initiating guru, destruction of scripture, and the staining of the Jain tradition, suggesting that all ascetics are like this. It brings ignorance, instability, and inappropriate associations; these are the distinguishing marks of corrupted monks. 

It is further stated that while these faults indeed occur, one also invites personal disaster. Those who wander freely may encounter thorns, unyielding animals like dogs and bulls that come due to anger, as well as snakes, barbarians, poison, and indigestion—these experiences lead them to their own demise and suffering.

It is said that such a wandering individual does not wish harm upon others; those who are proud, ragged, and unclean do not want to engage with the community and avoid gathering with the righteous.

## Chapter 4: Conduct Towards Guests

**Verse 160:**

All the ascetics, seeing a guest arriving from another congregation, should immediately rise up out of respect, motivated by affection, the desire to follow the teachings of the omniscient, to welcome the new ascetic, and to offer salutations.

**Verse 161:**

Upon meeting, they should take seven steps forward, exchange salutations, and inquire about the three jewels, all while performing the ritual of warming the feet.

**Verse 162:**

For a guest from another congregation, a guide should be assigned for three nights, in order to explain the details of the practices, and to observe their purity.

The Mulachara also mentions another way to conduct the examination:

**163**
*Aagantuya-vatthavva-padileha-hiṃ tu aṇṇamaṇṇehiṃ. Aṇṇoṇṇakaraṇa-caraṇaṃ jāṇaṇa-herdu parikkhanti.*
*Aagantuka-vaastavyaaḥ pratilekhanaabhis tu anyonyaabhiḥ. Anyonyakaraṇacaraṇam jñānahetuṃ parīkṣate.*
**Meaning:** The monks who have come to the sangha and the monks who reside in the same sangha should examine each other by observing the actions of each other, such as the writing of the *padileha* (a record of the actions of a monk), in order to understand the thirteen types of *karaṇa* (actions) and *charitra* (conduct).

**164**
*Koṇṇ 2 sthāṇoṃmeṃ parīkṣā-karaṇe yaha kahete haṃ; āvāsaya-ṭhāṇādīsu paḍilehaṇa-vayaṇa-gahaṇaṇikkhēve. Sajjhā-ega-vihāre bhikṣaggahaṇe paricchati.*
*Aavashyakasthaanaadiṣu pratilekhanavachanagrahaṇanikṣepeṣu. Khaadhyaaye ekavihāre bhikṣāgrahaṇe parīkṣate.*
**Meaning:** They should examine each other in six essential places and in the actions of *kaayo-utsarga* (the practice of complete bodily stillness): in the *padileha* (record of actions), in the way they speak, in the way they pick up and put down objects, in the *khaadhyaaya* (the practice of eating), in the *ekavihāra* (the practice of solitary meditation), and in the *bhikṣāgrahaṇa* (the practice of begging for food).

**165**
*Ab āye hue muni bhi parīkṣā kaise kareṃ usaki rīti vatlaate haṃ; vissami-do tadi-vasaṃ mīmasitta ṇivedayidi gaṇiṇe. Viṇaeṇāgama-kajaṃ bidie tadi-e va divasammi.*
*Viśrāntaḥ tadivasaṃ mīmāṃsitvā niśvedayati gaṇine. Viṇaeṇāgamakajaṃ bidie tadi-e va divasammi.*
**Meaning:** The newly arrived monk should reflect on the day's events and report them to the *gaṇi* (leader of the sangha). He should also report any actions that are not in accordance with the *viṇaya* (rules of conduct) and the *āgama* (scriptural teachings).

If a Muni is pure in conduct and action, always diligent, humble and intelligent, then the Acharya should tell him what he desires, speaking according to his own knowledge. || 167 ||

**Meaning:** If a Muni is pure in his 13 types of conduct and 13 types of action, is always diligent, does not commit any transgression, is humble and intelligent, then the Acharya should tell him what he desires, speaking according to his own knowledge. || 167 ||

If the visitor is not like this, then the Acharya should do as follows: If he is unfit for Chheda or Upastapana, then it should be done. If he does not want it, then he should be abandoned. If he accepts it, then he is also a Chheda. || 168 ||

**Meaning:** If the visitor is impure in conduct and action, unfit for Devavandana, then the Acharya should look at the Pratikramana Shastra and perform Chheda and Upastapana. If he does not accept Chheda and Upastapana, then he should be abandoned. If he accepts the unfit one out of attachment, then the Acharya is also liable for Pratikramana. || 168 ||

Then what should be done? This is said: He who is fit according to the Dharma, should be accepted according to the Dharma. He who is learning the meaning of the Sutras should do this with effort. || 169 ||

**Samaacharaadhikaara 4.**  The Vidhaanakaar should purify his conduct from the Aachaaryas and learn the Sutraartha diligently from them. || 169 ||

Further, it is said how to diligently practice:

**Padilēhiūṇ sammṁ davvṁ khettṁ ca kaalabhāvē ya. Viṇavovayārajuttēṇajjhēdāvvṁ payattēṇ. || 170 ||**

**Pratyaalekhhya samyak dravya kshetram cha kaalabhaavau cha. Vinayopachaar yuktena adhyetavya prayatnena. || 170 ||**

**Meaning:**  Purification of dravya (substance) is to cleanse the body from impurities like boils, wounds, and underground skin, bones, urine, feces, etc. Purification of kshetra (field) is to cleanse the ground for a distance of one hundred cubits. Purification of kaal (time) is to avoid times like dusk, thunder, lightning, and other calamities. Purification of bhaav (emotion) is to abandon anger, etc.  Thus, the muni should diligently study (read) with proper vinaya (discipline) and upachaar (conduct) after carefully observing the purity of these four: dravya, kshetra, kaal, and bhaav. || 170 ||

It is said what happens if one does not purify dravya, etc.:

**Davvādīvadīkkamṇṁ karedi suttatthasikkhālohēṇ. Asamahimasajjhāyṁ kalahaṁ vāhiṁ viyogṁ ca. || 171 ||**

**Dravyaadi vyatikramanam karoti sutraarth shikshaalobhena. Asamaadhir asvadhyaayaha kalaho vyaadhih viyogaha cha. || 171 ||**

**Meaning:** If the visiting muni, due to his greed for learning the Sutraartha, violates the purity of dravya, etc., i.e., disobeys the Shastra, then he will face the following faults: asamaadhi (lack of concentration), asvadhyaaya (lack of self-study), kalaha (quarrel), vyaadhi (disease), and viyoga (separation). || 171 ||

## Mulachara

This purity is not only for reading, but also for the sake of living beings;  **Santhara** dwelling, water, and **darshan** (sight) are all important.  In both morning and evening, one should carefully mark the lines of the hands.  ||172||

**Santhara** dwelling, water, and **darshan** (sight) are all important.  In both morning and evening, one should carefully mark the lines of the hands.  ||172||

**Meaning:**  The four types of **Santhara** are pure earth, stone, wood, and grass.  One should carefully clean the **Santhara** and its area (space) by marking the lines of the hands in both morning and evening, when the eyes are bright enough to see.  ||172||

One should not act arbitrarily in another **Sangha**;  when going to **Uddhama** (a place of pilgrimage), **Uttarayoga** (a place of study), or starting a new **Karma**, one should ask the **Acharya** with a respectful intention.  ||173||

## Mulachar

This section discusses how monks should conduct themselves with visiting nuns in their order.

**80**

* **Verse 177:**  "When the Aryas arrive, one should not remain alone. Nor should one engage in conversation with them without a purpose. If there is a need to speak for the sake of Dharma, one should speak briefly."

**Meaning:** When Aryas (nuns) arrive, monks should not be alone in the forest. They should not engage in idle conversation with them. If there is a need to speak for the sake of Dharma, they should do so briefly.

* **Verse 178:** "One should not answer a question from one of the Aryas alone. If a question is asked in the presence of the Ganini (head nun), then one should answer."

**Meaning:** If a nun asks a question, a monk should not answer alone, fearing slander. If the question is asked in the presence of the head nun, then the monk should answer.

* **Verse 179:** "If a young monk engages in conversation or discussion with a young woman, he commits five faults: disobedience, transgression, etc."

**Meaning:** A young monk should not engage in conversation or discussion with a young woman. Doing so would be considered disobedience, transgression, and other faults.

Page #118:
---------------------------
## Chapter 4: On the Right to Speak

**Verse 179:** If one engages in conversation mixed with laughter, etc., then one should know that they have committed the five faults (sins) of transgression, etc.

**Verse 180:** It is not appropriate for those who have renounced (the world) to stay in the homes of the wealthy. There, engaging in prohibited activities, studying, taking food and alms, and performing the act of renunciation, etc., are all prohibited.

**Meaning:** It is not suitable for the renunciant monks to stay in the homes of the wealthy. And while staying there, they should not engage in activities like sleeping, studying, taking food and alms, performing the act of renunciation, etc.

**Verse 181:** Even a monk who is endowed with qualities like seniority, etc., is corrupted by association with women. A monk, even if he is an elder, has been ordained for a long time, is a learned teacher, is an ascetic, or belongs to a noble lineage, does not consider his own self, his long ordination, his position as a teacher, his knowledge of all scriptures, his ascetic practices, or his lineage. He destroys them all, and also destroys his own right faith and other virtues.

**Meaning:** A monk whose mind is polluted by lust does not value his own self, his long ordination, his position as a teacher, his knowledge of all scriptures, his ascetic practices, or his lineage. He destroys them all, and also destroys his own right faith and other virtues.

Page #119:
---------------------------
## 82
**Mulachar**

If one does not destroy the qualities of the soul but inevitably receives blame;

**Kanna vidhava anteuriyam tah sairini salingam va. Acirenaalliyamanavavadam tatha pappadi. || 182 ||**

**Kanya vidhava antahpurikam tatha khairini salingini va. Acirenaalapyamano apavadam tatra praproti. || 182 ||**

**Meaning:** A Muni who engages in even a moment's conversation with a young girl, a widow, a queen, or a woman who is a libertine, self-willed, or has taken the vows, will receive public censure. || 182 ||

It is said that how can the *pratikraman* (atonement) and other things happen by leaving the company of the Aryas;

**Piyadhammo dadadhammo sanviggo'vajjabhiru parisuddho. Sangahanuggahakusalosadadam sarakkhanajutto. || 183 ||**

**Priyadharma dharmasamvigna avajjabhiru parishuddha. Sangrahanuggrahakushala satatam sararakshanayukta. || 183 ||**

**Meaning:** The leader of the Aryas should be one who loves the highest virtues like forgiveness, is firm in his Dharma, rejoices in Dharma, fears sin, is pure in all ways, i.e., has unblemished conduct, is skilled in making new disciples and nurturing them through initiation and teachings, and is always engaged in good deeds and giving advice. || 183 ||

**Gambhiro buddhariso midavadi appako duhallo ya. Chirappavva gihidattho ajjanam ganadharo hodi. || 184 ||**

Page #120:
---------------------------
**Translation:**

News Authority 4. He should be serious, difficult to overwhelm, moderate in speech, have little curiosity. He should be a long-initiated ascetic who understands the texts related to conduct and atonement. Such an Acharya can give instruction to the Aryas. 

If such a person, endowed with these qualities, makes a mistake in acting as a Ganadhara (a teacher or leader among the monks) to the unworthy, his authority over the four periods (kalas) of sustenance and others will be lost. 

What benefit is there in excessive speech? Whatever the wish of the Ganadhara may be, the visiting monk should act accordingly. The same should hold true for the other monks, i.e., those who reside within his group.

Now, as for the news regarding the Aryas, it should be mentioned that this information applies even to the unworthy.

Page #121:
---------------------------
## 84. Mulachara

**187.**  All day and night, one should speak as appropriate. This is the conduct of the Aryas, as previously stated.  *Meaning:* Just as the conduct of the Muni Rajas has been described, so too should the Aryas conduct themselves appropriately throughout the day and night.  The Aryas do not engage in practices like tree-root worship.

**188.**  The Aryikas are mutually supportive and protective of one another. They are free from anger, hatred, and deceit. They are characterized by modesty, which arises from fear of public censure, and by discipline, which leads them to the path of righteousness. These qualities are conducive to the well-being of both families.

**189.**  The Aryikas are constantly engaged in study, recitation, listening, contemplation, and meditation. They are also dedicated to austerity, humility, and self-control.  *Meaning:* They are constantly engaged in the study of scriptures, reciting what they have learned, listening to scriptures, contemplating the impermanence of things, and meditating on the nature of reality. They are also dedicated to austerity, humility, and self-control.

Page #122:
---------------------------
## Chapter 4: Conduct

**Verse 189:**  Aryikas are diligent in Vinaya (discipline) and Samyama (self-control), and they are engaged in the practice of knowledge and auspicious conduct.

**Verse 190:**  Their clothes are free from impurities, their bodies are free from blemishes, and they are free from dirt and adornment. Their conduct is pure, reflecting the lineage of Dharma, their noble family, their fame, and their vows.

**Verse 191:**  Two, three, or many Aryikas can live together in a place free from the company of the undisciplined, in a place free from obstacles, and in a place conducive to pure conduct.

**Verse 192:**  Aryikas should not go to another's house without a purpose. If it is necessary to go for a purpose, they should go only after asking the Ganini (head nun) and with the consent of the Sangha (community).

Page #123:
---------------------------
## 86
## Mulacara

One should not go out. If it is absolutely necessary to go out, then one should ask the senior Aryika and go out with other Aryikas, only during the time of begging, etc. || 192 ||

Further, Aryikas should not perform these actions: crying, bathing children, feeding children, cooking, spinning, sewing, and six other actions. They should not wash or clean the feet of the virtuous, nor should they sing. || 193 ||

**Meaning:** Aryikas should not cry in their own residence or in the homes of others, nor should they bathe children. They should not feed children, cook, spin, sew, or perform six other actions. They should not wash or clean the feet of the virtuous, nor should they sing with attachment. || 193 ||

Three, five, or seven Aryikas should protect each other. They should always go out for begging with the senior Aryikas. || 194 ||

**Meaning:** Aryikas should go out for begging or to pay respects to the Acharya, etc., in groups of three, five, or seven. They should protect each other and go out with the senior Aryikas. || 194 ||

Further, the method of paying respects is explained:

With five, six, or seven hands, the Shuri, the Sadhu, and the Aryikas should pay respects. They should pay respects with folded hands, as if they are bowing down. || 195 ||

Page #124:
---------------------------
Chapter 4: On the Rules of Conduct

195. Āryikās should offer salutations to Ācāryas from a distance of five handspans, to Upādhyāyas from a distance of six handspans, and to Sādhus from a distance of seven handspans, sitting on a cow's seat. They should also engage in critical study and praise.

196. Sādhus and Āryikās who conduct themselves in this manner will attain liberation, having received the worship, fame, and happiness of the world.

197. I have described this multi-faceted code of conduct, known as Samācāra, in a concise manner. Wise people should elaborate on it in detail.

Thus ends the fourth chapter on Samācāra, from the Mūlācāra, composed by Ācārya Śrī Vattkeśvarī, in the Hindi language.

## Five Great Vows and Liberation

**5. Further describing the nature of liberation:**

## 106. Mulachara

**Desire for worldly things:** One who does not abandon these three desires attains the purity of Samyak Darshan. || 249 ||

**Desire for worldly things:** The desire for worldly things like becoming a Chakravarti like Baldeva, a Setthi, a king, etc., and the desire for becoming a Deva, seeking a vision of a Deva, etc., in the next life, is a defect that destroys Darshan. || 250 ||

**Meaning:** The desire for wealth in this world, such as becoming a Chakravarti like Balabhadra, a wealthy merchant, etc., and the desire to become a Deva in the next life, is a defect that destroys Darshan. || 250 ||

**Desire for other religions:** The desire for the Dharma of other religions like the Vaibhashika, etc., with their four divisions, the Buddhists, the Naiyayika, the Vaisheshika, the Jata-dhari, the Vaineyika, the Sankhya, etc., is a defect called Kudharm-kanksha. || 251 ||

**Meaning:** The desire for the Dharma of other religions like the Vaibhashika, etc., with their four divisions, the Buddhists, the Naiyayika, the Vaisheshika, the Jata-dhari, the Vaineyika, the Sankhya, etc., is a defect called Kudharm-kanksha. || 251 ||

**Doubt:** Doubt is of two types: in substance and in feeling. Doubt about the substance of the Muni's urine, feces, saliva, etc., is a doubt about substance.

Page #144:
---------------------------
## Chapter 5: The Five Great Vows

**Verse 107**

To be disgusted by the excretions of the body, such as feces, urine, phlegm, nasal mucus, skin, bones, blood, flesh, vomit, and all other bodily impurities, is **dravya-vichkikitsa** (material aversion). To be disgusted by hunger, thirst, and other such things is **bhava-vichkikitsa** (mental aversion).

**Verse 253**

**Uccaram** (excrement), **passavana** (urine), **khelam** (phlegm), **singhanayam** (nasal mucus), **chammatti** (skin), **puyam** (bones), **mansaso nidavam** (flesh and blood), **jalladi** (vomit), and all other impurities of the body are to be avoided by the virtuous.

**Verse 254**

**Kshuttrishna** (hunger and thirst), **shitooshna** (cold and heat), **danshamashaka** (bites and stings), **achelabhavo** (nakedness), **arati rati** (disliking and liking), **stricarya** (sexual intercourse), **nisiddhya** (sitting), **shayya** (sleeping), **akrosh** (anger), **badhayachanam** (begging), **alaho** (poverty), **roga** (disease), **tanapsparsha** (touching grass), **jalla** (vomit), **satkara** (honoring), **prajnaparishaha** (attachment to knowledge), **anjanam** (ignorance), **adarshanam** (lack of vision), and **khamanam** (forgiveness) are the twenty-two **parishahas** (attachments) that lead to suffering.

**Verse 255**

To be disgusted by these twenty-two **parishahas** is **bhava-vichkikitsa** (mental aversion).

**Verse 256**

To be attached to the world, to be deluded by other gods, and to be attached to the body are all forms of **bhava-vichkikitsa** (mental aversion).

Page #145:
---------------------------
108  
The main teachings of Mūlāchāraṇa do not involve engaging in the delusions of worldly and Vedic practices. Knowing that they disrupt one’s perception, one should not act according to one's own capacities.  

The delusions have four categories: worldly delusion, Vedic delusion, Samāyika delusion, and delusion associated with other deities. Understanding these four as perception-disruptors, one should not act using one's own power.  

The teachings by Kautilya (Chanakya), related to the Mahabharata and Ramayana, such as those that advocate deceit and similarly worldly doctrines, are considered worldly delusions.  

Kautilya's teachings and those of the Mahabharata and Ramayana describe certain principles. If one understands them as credible, they become deluded by the world.  

Moving on to Vedic delusion, the Rigveda, Samaveda, and other Vedic texts are teaching statements. If one does not recognize the trivial nature of them, one becomes deluded by Vedic teachings.  

The Rigveda, Samaveda, and other Vedic scriptures related to rituals, along with texts like Manusmriti, etc., are primarily teachings that perpetuate violence; for this reason, they are deemed to lack true Dharma.

Page #146:
---------------------------
## Chapter 5: The Five Great Vows

**Verse 109**

**259.** Those who are deluded by time (samayamudha) consider Buddhists, Naiyayikas, Vaisheshikas, Jata-dharis, Sankhyas, Shaivas, Pashupatas, Kapalikas, and other heterodox sects as liberators from the cycle of birth and death. They are deluded because they believe that these sects have good conduct.

**Explanation:** It is a mistake to consider these sects as liberators from the cycle of birth and death. They are not true liberators because they do not follow the true path of liberation.

**Verse 110**

**260.** Those who are deluded by gods (devamudha) consider Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu, Parvati, Skanda, and other gods as true gods. They are deluded because they do not understand the true nature of gods.

**Explanation:** It is a mistake to consider these gods as true gods. They are not true gods because they are not liberated from the cycle of birth and death.

**Verse 111**

**261.** One who sees the suffering of beings who are deficient in right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, and with devotion to Dharma, takes them under his protection, becomes pure in his own faith.

**Explanation:** This verse describes the virtue of taking others under one's protection. It is a virtue to help those who are suffering and to guide them towards the path of liberation.

**111**

One should strive to influence others towards Jainism by practicing non-violent penance, compassion and kindness towards all living beings. One should also influence others by understanding the true meaning of the scriptures, conquering opponents with the power of words, and practicing the eightfold path, knowledge, worship, and charity. || 264 ||

**265**

"Whatever the Jinas have taught is the truth" - this is the true understanding of the nature of reality. This is the essence of Right Faith (Samyak Darshan). The opposite of this, i.e., not believing in the teachings of the Jinas, is the essence of False Faith (Mithyatva). || 265 ||

**266**

I have briefly explained the Right Faith (Darshanachara). Now I will explain the eight types of Right Conduct (Gnanachara) which, when practiced, liberate the soul from the eight types of karmas (Avaranas) and lead to liberation. || 266 ||

**267**

Now I will explain the nature of Right Conduct:

That which awakens the truth, that which calms the mind, that which purifies the soul - this is the knowledge taught by the Jinas. || 267 ||

Page #149:

## 112
## Mulachar

**267**
That knowledge which purifies the soul is considered supreme in the Jain religion.
**Meaning:** That knowledge which enables one to understand the true nature of things, which stops the mind's activity, i.e., brings the mind under control, and which purifies the soul, is considered supreme in Jainism.

**268**

**Meaning:** That knowledge which makes one detached from attachment (raga) like lust, anger, etc., which makes one attached to the path of righteousness (shreyas), and which inspires friendship towards all beings, is considered supreme in Jainism.

**269**
Knowledge-conduct is eightfold: time, discipline, effort, respect, humility, pronunciation, meaning, and understanding.
**Meaning:** The eight aspects of knowledge-conduct are: time for study, discipline of speech and body according to the scriptures, effort in study, respect and honour for the teacher and the scriptures, humility in acknowledging the teacher and the scriptures, correct pronunciation, understanding the true meaning of the scriptures, and understanding the meaning of the scriptures along with the text.

**269**
Now, we will discuss time-conduct in detail: Time-conduct is to be understood as the time for eating, the time for sleeping, and the time for meditation.

Page #150:

## Chapter 5: The Five Great Vows

### Verse 270:

**Both times, study is to be done.**

**Meaning:**  The **Pradoshik** (evening), **Vairaatrik** (night), and **Gousargik** (day) times are divided into two parts: the **Purvakal** (early) and **Aparakal** (late). Study should be done in both these times of the day and night.

**Explanation:** The **Pradoshik** time is the time near the end of the day, when the sun is setting. The **Vairaatrik** time is the two hours after midnight. The **Gousargik** time is the two hours before noon.  Study should be done in all these times except the **Pradoshik** time.

### Verse 271:

**When starting study, know the seven-foot shadow of the thighs.  And when the sun sets, end study when the shadow is seven feet.**

**Meaning:** When starting study, the shadow of the thighs should be seven feet long. When the sun sets, study should be ended when the shadow of the thighs is again seven feet long.

### Verse 272:

**In Ashadha, the shadow is two feet long at noon. In Chaitra, it is four feet long. It increases and decreases by two angulas each month.**

**Meaning:** In the month of Ashadha, the shadow of a person is two feet long at noon. In the month of Chaitra, it is four feet long. The length of the shadow increases and decreases by two angulas (finger widths) each month.

---------------------------
## 114
## Mulachara

**Verse 272:**
In the month of Ashadha, on the last day, two prahar before noon, the shadow of the thigh is two vilastha, that is, twelve angulas. And in the month of Pausha, on the last day, the shadow of the thigh is twenty-four angulas. And then, it increases and decreases by two angulas every month. The time for eating is from two ghadi after the beginning and end of each sandhya.

**Verse 273:**
For the purity of the division of directions, in the morning, one should study (read and chant) nine gatha, in the third prahar, seven gatha, and in the evening, five gatha.

**Verse 274:**
The burning of the direction, the falling of meteors, lightning, the clashing of clouds, the bad smell of the evening, the bad day, the eclipse of the moon and the sun, and the fight of Rahu are the defects that cause the impurity of the time.

Page #152:
---------------------------
## Chapter 5: The Five Restraints

**115**

Lightning, heavy rain, seeing five-colored objects shaped like bows, foul smell, red-yellow colored objects in the evening, days covered with clouds, collision of the celestial bodies of the moon, sun, and Rahu. || 274 ||

Quarrels, smoke-like comets, earthquakes, and thunder. These and many other faults are to be avoided during study. || 275 ||

**Meaning:** Words of quarrel, disputes over wood etc., seeing smoke-like shapes in the sky, earthquakes, thunder, strong winds, fire - these and many other faults are prohibited during study. This means that one should not engage in new reading and learning when such faults are present. || 275 ||

Now, the purification of substance, space, and emotion is described:

Blood, pus, rotten flesh, etc., should not be in contact with the body. Leave a space of one hundred cubits in all directions from that place. Anger, pride, deceit, greed, jealousy, etc., should not be present. This is the purification of substance, space, and emotion, respectively, during the time of study. || 276 ||

Page #153:
---------------------------
The **Mulacara** refers to the sutras that are said to be spoken by the **Ganadharas**, **Pratyekabuddhas**, and **Shrutakevalis**, as well as those that are **Abhinna Dasapuurva** (uninterruptedly spoken by the ten predecessors). [277]

It is not appropriate for **Viratas** (women) to study these sutras. Other texts are more suitable for their study. [278]

These other texts include: **Aarahaananijutti**, **Maranavibhatti**, **Sangrahatthudi**, **Panchakkhana**, **Aavasayadhammakhao**, and **Erisao**. [279]

These texts describe the four **Aaraadhanas** (practices) of **Samyagdarshana** (right faith), etc., the seventeen types of **Marana** (death), the **Pancha Sangraha** (five collections), **Stotra** (hymns), and the teachings on the renunciation of **Aahara** (food) and other things.

## Five Great Vows (Pancha-achara) - Chapter 5

**Verse 290:**

One who is truthful (Satya-vrata) does not speak false words that are deceitful, hurtful, or cause pain to others, at any time, through mind, speech, or body, due to laughter, fear, anger, or greed.

**Verse 292:**

One who is celibate (Brahmacharya-vrata) should never engage, through mind, speech, or body, in any of the four types of sexual activities, including inanimate objects, deities, humans, and animals, even if they are very attractive.

"Sahethi jen mahattham acharidaani a ja mahalllehi. Jan cha mahallani tado mahavvadaai bhave taai." || 294 ||

"Sadhayanti yat mahathai acharitani cha yat mahadhbhih. Yachcha mahanati tatha mahavratani bhavanti tani." || 294 ||

**Meaning:** Because they lead to the great goal of liberation, and because they were followed by great men like the Tirthankaras, they are worthy of respect, as they eliminate all karmic actions. Therefore, they are called "mahavrat" (great vows). || 294 ||

## Chapter 5: The Five Great Vows

**123**

**296.**  Even a slight transgression of the five vows, or even doubt about them, can lead to self-inflicted harm, especially when partaking of food at night.  This is because there is a risk of violating the vows, becoming contaminated, encountering thieves, or being apprehended by the authorities. Therefore, one should absolutely avoid eating at night.

**297.**  There are eight types of conduct (charitra-achar) based on the eight types of preachers (pravachana-matas).  These are characterized by the combination of *pranidhana* (vow) and *yoga* (effort) in the five *samitis* (assemblies) and the three *guptis* (secrecies).  One should know that this is the eightfold conduct.

**298.**  *Pranidhana* (vow) is also of two types: praiseworthy and unpraiseworthy.  The *pranidhana* that leads to the five *samitis* and the three *guptis* is praiseworthy, while the *pranidhana* that leads to the remaining sense objects is unpraiseworthy.

Page #164:
---------------------------
## Five Great Vows (Pancha-achara) - Chapter 5

**308.** There are ten types of truth: truth of the people, truth of consensus, truth of establishment, truth of name, truth of form, truth of perception, truth of expectation, truth of conduct, truth of emotion, and truth of analogy.

**309.** Truth of the people is like the various names for rice, such as "choru" and "kul," which are used in different languages. Truth of consensus is what is accepted by many people, like calling the king's wife "devi" in the world.

**310.** Truth of establishment is like the names "deva" and "devadatta" given to deities and people. Truth of name is like calling something "utkatatar" (very intense) based on its color, like a white heron.

**Verse 312:**

* **Meaning:**  What is possible is *sambhavna-satya* (truth of possibility), like if someone wishes, they can do it. If Indra wishes, he can overturn Jambudvipa (the continent).

**Verse 313:**

* **Meaning:**  What is free from the faults of violence, etc., even if it is not real, is *bhava-satya* (truth of intention), like if someone asks if they saw a thief, and they say "No." What is said with a simile is *upamā-satya* (truth of simile), like saying "He is like a mountain" or "He is like the ocean."

**Verse 314:**

* **Meaning:**  Now, we will discuss false speech, etc.  What is the opposite of truth, and what is both true and false?  The opposite of truth is false speech, and what is both true and false is *tavivari* (a statement that is both true and false).

Page #166:
---------------------------
## Chapter 5: The Five Great Vows

**122**

**Verse 314:**
Speech contrary to the ten truths is false speech. Where both are present, it is satyamr̥ṣā, and what is contrary to this is asatyamr̥ṣā speech.

**Verse 315:**
Now, the types of asatyamr̥ṣā speech are: āmantraṇī, āṇavaṇī, jāyaṇī, sampucchanī, prajñāpanī, pratyākhyānī, icchānulomā, saṃsayavacanī, and anakkharagatā.

Āmantraṇī is the speech that invites someone to come forward, āṇavaṇī is the speech that commands, jāyaṇī is the speech that requests, sampucchanī is the speech that inquires, prajñāpanī is the speech that informs, pratyākhyānī is the speech that rejects, icchānulomā is the speech that conforms to one's desires, saṃsayavacanī is the speech that expresses doubt, and anakkharagatā is the speech that is devoid of letters.

**Explanation:**
O Devadatta, speech that invites someone to come forward is āmantraṇī speech, speech that commands is āṇavaṇī speech, speech that requests is jāyaṇī speech, speech that inquires is sampucchanī speech, speech that informs is prajñāpanī speech, speech that rejects is pratyākhyānī speech, speech that conforms to one's desires is icchānulomā speech, speech that expresses doubt is saṃsayavacanī speech, and speech that is devoid of letters is anakkharagatā speech.

These nine types of asatyamr̥ṣā speech are called so because they are neither completely true nor completely false. They are neither completely true because they lack specific knowledge, and they are neither completely false because they possess general knowledge.

## Chapter 5: The Five Great Vows

**141 -** Other similar things should be understood as being without desire. || 349 ||

**Meaning:** Renouncing all four types of food until death is the non-desiring fast. It has three main types: *bhakta-pratijna*, *ingini-maran*, and *prayopgamana-maran*. *Bhakta-pratijna* is the renunciation of food by a monk whose body is served by a *niryapaka muni* (a monk who performs the duties of a servant) from the second to the forty-eighth day, and who also serves the monk's body with their own limbs. *Ingini-maran* is the renunciation of food where there is no expectation of benefit from others. *Prayopgamana-maran* is the renunciation of food where there is no expectation of benefit from either oneself or others. And so on, other things should be understood as being non-desiring renunciations, up to the complete non-desiring fast. || 349 ||

Now, the nature of *avamoudarya-tapa* is explained:

**350 -** Thirty-two *kavala* (mouthfuls) are naturally the food of a man. Taking less than one *kavala* is *avamoudarya*. || 350 ||

**Meaning:** A man's natural food intake is thirty-two mouthfuls. Taking less than one mouthful, etc., is the *avamoudarya-tapa*. || 350 ||

**351 -** It helps in understanding knowledge, etc., in the context of *dharma-avasaya-yoga* (the practice of the essential virtues). It is not a practice of *avamoudarya-tapa* that is hateful to the senses. || 351 ||

**Meaning:** It helps in understanding knowledge, etc., in the context of *dharma-avasaya-yoga* (the practice of the essential virtues), such as forgiveness, etc., and *samayika*, etc., which are essential practices. It is not a practice of *avamoudarya-tapa* that is hateful to the senses. || 351 ||

## 142
## Mulachar

This avoidance of indulgence helps in the practice of the Muladi Yogas and in self-study, etc. It prevents the senses from becoming uncontrolled. 351 Further, the nature of the Tapas of Rasa-Parityaag is described as follows:

"The abandonment of milk, curd, ghee, oil, jaggery, and salt (non-veg), or the acceptance of bitter, pungent, astringent, sour, and sweet tastes." 352

**Meaning:** The abandonment of these six tastes (milk, curd, ghee, oil, jaggery, and salt) or the acceptance of these five tastes (bitter, pungent, astringent, sour, and sweet) is the Tapas of Rasa-Parityaag. 352

Further, the four Maha-Vikritis are described as follows:

"The four Maha-Vikritis are: butter, alcohol, meat, and honey. They are the causes of desire, attachment, pride, and restraint." 353

**Meaning:** Butter, alcohol, meat, and honey are the four Maha-Vikritis. They cause lust, intoxication (pride and intoxication), and violence. 353

"Those who are obedient to the commands of the omniscient, who are afraid of sins, and who are dedicated to Tapas, should avoid these four Maha-Vikritis throughout their lives, as well as in the past." 354

**Meaning:** Those who are obedient to the commands of the omniscient, who are afraid of sins, and who are dedicated to Tapas, should avoid these four Maha-Vikritis throughout their lives, as well as in the past. 354

## Panchachar Adhikar 5:

**143.**  In the practice of tapas, the **bhavya jivas** should first abandon these four until death. || 354 ||

**Further, the **vrittiparisankhyatapa** is described as follows:

**Gocharpramanam dayakabhajannanaavidhanam yagruhanam. Tatha ashanasya grahanam vividhasya vrittiparisankhya.** || 355 ||

**Meaning:**  The **vrittiparisankhyatapa** is the practice of taking food with many variations in the size of the house, the nature of the food giver, the type of utensils (like brass), and the type of food (like sattu). For example, a sadhu might make a vow to only eat from a brass utensil or only eat sattu, and if these conditions are not met, they will not eat. These difficult vows are undertaken by sadhus to test their **antaraya karma**. || 355 ||

**Further, the **kayakleshatapa** is described as follows:

**Thanasyanasanehi yavivhehi yuggayeh bahugehi. Anuveechiparitao kayakleso havdi eso.** || 356 ||

**Meaning:**

This is the external austerity which prevents the mind from arising in evil, which increases faith, and which does not diminish the practice.

**Verse 359:**

* **Original:** एसो दु बाहिरतवो बाहिरजणपायडो परम घोरो । अभंतरजणणां वोच्छं अब्भंतरं वि तवं ॥ ३५९ ॥

The five **Astikayas** (categories of existence), the six **Jeevakaayas** (categories of living beings), **Kaal** (time), and **Dravy** (matter) are all worthy of accepting the commands of the **Sarvjna** (Omniscient).  This act of accepting the commands with faith and contemplation is **Aagnaavichay** meditation. || 399 ||

## The Five Great Vows and the Inner Purification

**5. The Five Great Vows**

The Five Great Vows are the foundation of Jain conduct. They purify the mind, speech, and body, and lead to a state of single-pointedness and humility.

**410. The Five Great Vows**

The Five Great Vows are the foundation of Jain conduct. They purify the mind, speech, and body, and lead to a state of single-pointedness and humility.

**411. The Fourfold Path to the Mansion of Liberation**

The path to the Mansion of Liberation (moksha) is fourfold:

* **Dravya (Substance):** This refers to the material aspects of the path, such as diet, clothing, and possessions.
* **Kshetra (Field):** This refers to the environment in which one practices, such as a forest, a city, or a mountain.
* **Kala (Time):** This refers to the timing of one's practice, such as the seasons or the time of day.
* **Bhaava (State of Mind):** This refers to the mental state of the practitioner, such as their level of attachment, aversion, or delusion.

Just as one must adapt to the changing seasons, so too must one adapt their practice to the changing circumstances of their life.

**412. The Inner Purification**

This inner purification is the true essence of the inner vow. I will now briefly describe the path of the heroic vow.

**413. The Heroic Vow**

The heroic vow is characterized by unwavering strength and determination. It is the path of the truly liberated soul, who has overcome all obstacles and attained the highest state of being.

## Mulachara

**It should be known that the conduct of strength (Veeryachar) is the way in which the soul is united with the three types of permissible conduct, namely, *pratiseva*, *pratisunana*, and *sanvasa*, which are free from the seventeen types of non-permissible conduct, arising from food and other sources, and which are the strength and power of the virtuous.** || 413 ||

**Pratiseva, pratisunana, and sanvasa are the three types of permissible conduct. If a worthy person is given food and other things, or if they are offered to them, it is called *pratiseva*.** || 414 ||

**If a worthy person is told beforehand or afterwards that food and other things are prepared for them, and they accept it after hearing this and remain content, it is called *pratisunana*. If they develop a sense of possessiveness towards food and other things, thinking that this household is ours, it is called *sanvasa*, the third type of permissible conduct. Therefore, those who follow the conduct of strength should abandon these three faults.** || 415 ||

## Fivefold Restraint 5.165

**The restraint of the fivefold restraint is to be understood as follows:**

**416.** Restraint in the activities of the two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, and five-sensed living beings.

**417.** Restraint in the form of non-inscription, improper inscription, disregard, and removal, as well as restraint of mind, speech, and body, are to be known as the seventeen types of restraint.

**Meaning:**

Protecting the five types of living beings - earth-bodied, water-bodied, fire-bodied, air-bodied, and plant-bodied - constitutes the fivefold restraint.  Furthermore, protecting the two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, and five-sensed living beings results in four categories.  Additionally, refraining from cutting dry grass and other similar actions, which constitutes the protection of non-living beings, adds another category, making a total of ten categories.  Combining the seven categories of non-inscription, improper inscription, disregard, removal, restraint of mind, restraint of speech, and restraint of body, results in seventeen types of restraint.

**Further Explanation:**

The restraint of non-inscription refers to the purification of substances.  The restraint of improper inscription refers to the careful and mindful purification, free from carelessness.  The restraint of disregard refers to the daily inspection of tools and equipment to ensure they are free from living beings.  The restraint of removal refers to the removal of two-sensed and other living beings from tools and equipment.  These seventeen types of restraint protect the virtue of non-violence.

**416.417.** The five tastes, five colors, two scents, eight touches, and seven sounds, as well as the fourteen types of living beings that are perceived by the senses, are all subject to restraint.

Page #203:
---------------------------
166
Five tastes, five colors, two scents, eight touches, seven notes, fourteen mental objects, and the senses and life force - the restraint of these twenty-eight objects is called sense restraint. And the protection of the fourteen types of beings is called life restraint. Thus, there are two types of restraint. 418
Meaning - Five tastes, five colors, two scents, eight touches, seven notes, and mental objects - the restraint of these twenty-eight objects is called sense restraint. And the protection of the fourteen types of beings is called life restraint. Thus, there are two types of types of restraint. 418
Now the greatness of the five conducts is described:
**Darsana, Jnana, Charitra, Tapa, Viriya, Achar, Nigraha, Samatha** - the ascetic who is capable of these eight conducts, who has cleansed his soul, attains liberation. 419
Meaning - The ascetic who is capable of these eight conducts, who has cleansed his soul, attains liberation. 419
Thus, the explanation of the five conducts is given. In this way, the fifth chapter of the *Moolachar* commentary in Hindi by Acharya Shri Vattkeri ends. 5

**168** Pramrushyam, parivartakam, abhigatam, udhbinnam, malarohan. Acchhedyam, anisrushtan, udgamdoshas tu shodasha ime. || 423 ||

**Meaning:** In the household, actions like grinding grain, etc., which are the beginning of karma, are considered adhokarma. It is generally considered virtuous to abandon them. The sixteen types of udgamdosha are: audeshikadosha, adhyadhidosha, putidosha, mishradosha, sthapitadosha, balidosha, pravartitadosha, pravishakarnadosha, kritadosha, pramrushyadosha, parivartaka dosha, abhigatadosha, udhbinnadosha, malarohdosha, acchhedyadosha, anisrushtdosha. || 423 ||

**Meaning:** Food made for the sake of Naga, Yaksha, and other deities, for the sake of other heretics, for the sake of the poor and needy, or in their name, is considered auddeshik. This type of food is considered to be of four types in summary. || 425 ||

Page #206:
---------------------------
Pindashuddhi Adhikār 6.169 discusses the various purposes of food offerings. There are four classifications based on intent: 

1. The purpose of almsgiving (uddese) is to provide food to anyone who arrives, which is called the general purpose (samuddesa). 
2. Food prepared for the sake of a hypocritical (pāṣaṇḍi) person of another faith is also considered a general purpose.
3. Food made for ascetics (tāpasa) or wandering monks (parivrājaka) is classified as a specific purpose (ādeśa).
4. Food prepared for Digambara (a sect of Jain monks) ascetics is considered serious and faulted as a collective purpose (samādheśa).

These are the four distinctions regarding purposes.

The next part describes the nature of an additional fault (adhyadhidōṣa): If a restrained monk lets the rice and water boil too long on the stove, delaying its offering to someone who has arrived, or if he prevents the monk from receiving food under the pretext of discussing dharma until the meal is prepared, this is considered an additional fault.

The text ends with a reference to the preparation process, emphasizing the importance of intention and the nature of food offerings among different groups within Jainism.

**428**
*Mulaachar* (non-prescribed) food mixed with *prasook* (prescribed) food is *pootikarma* (impurity). There are five types of *pootikarma* related to *prasook* food: *chulli* (stove), *udookhal* (mortar), *darvi* (pestle), *bhajan* (cooking vessel), and *gandh* (smell).  The vow is to not give food cooked on these to anyone until it is given to a *sadhu* (Jain monk). These five are the initial *doshas* (faults).

**429**
*Mishradoosha* (mixed fault) is when food is offered to *pasande* (heretics) or *saagare* (householders) along with *sadhus*.

**430**
*Sthapitadosha* (established fault) is when food cooked in one vessel is transferred to another vessel and then kept in one's own house or another's house.

Page #208:

**Chapter 6: Purity of Food**

**Verse 431:**
The remaining food offered to Yakshas, Nagas, etc., is considered to be tainted with the fault of offering. Similarly, the offering made for the arrival of the restrained ones (monks) is also considered to be tainted with the fault of offering.

**Verse 432:**
The fault of offering (Praabhrutka) is of two types: gross (Baadar) and subtle (Sukshm). Each of these two types is further divided into two: diminishing (Apakarshan) and increasing (Utkarshan). Diminishing is the loss of time, and increasing is the gain of time.

**Verse 433:**
The fault of offering (Praabhrutka) due to the change in days, fortnights, months, and years is of two types: gross (Baadar) and subtle (Sukshm). The gross fault is of two types: diminishing (Apakarshan) and increasing (Utkarshan). The subtle fault is also of two types: early (Purvaahna) and midday (Madhya).

This is the form of increasing and decreasing the time by turning them around in the afternoon. || 433 ||

Pradushkara is of two types, Sankraman and Prakasana, which should be understood. It is the gradual movement of vessels, food, etc., and the thinning of the mandap, etc. || 434 ||

**Meaning:** There are two types of Pradushkara dosha: Sankraman and Prakasana. When a sadhu comes home, taking food and vessels from one place to another is Sankraman. Cleaning the vessels, lighting a lamp, or illuminating the mandap, etc., is Prakasana dosha. || 434 ||

Kritatara dosha is also of two types: Dravya and Bhava. Each of these has two types: Kha and Para. Giving a cow, etc., in exchange for food and giving it to the sadhu when he comes for alms is Dravya Kritatara. Giving food to the sadhu in exchange for knowledge like Prajnapti, etc., or mantras like Chetaka, etc., is Bhava Kritatara dosha. || 435 ||

Laghiriya Rina is said to be the desire for food, etc., other than rice. This is also of two types: Savarddiya and Avarddiya. || 436 ||

**436.** This is again of two types: Savrudhik and Avrudhik.

**Meaning:** Giving food to the Sadhus by borrowing rice etc. from someone else is a Pramrushya Dosha. It has two types: Savrudhik and Avrudhik. Giving more than the borrowed amount is Savrudhik, and giving the exact amount borrowed is Avrudhik.

**437.**  **Beehikuraadihiṃ ya saalikuraadiyaṃ tu jaṃ gahiḍaṃ. Daatuṃ iti saṃjadaaṇaṃ pariyaha hodi ṇayavvaṃ.**

**Meaning:**  Food like rice, brought directly from a row of three or seven houses, is considered *achinna* (fit for consumption). However, food brought from seven houses where the houses are not in a straight row, or food like *odana* (cooked rice) brought from the eighth house or beyond, is considered *anachinna* (not fit for consumption). || 439 ||

**Meaning:** There are four types of *sarvabhigatadosha* (contamination by all): *swagrame* (own village), *paragrame* (another village), *swadeshe* (own country), and *paradeshe* (another country). Bringing food from a neighborhood in the east to a neighborhood in the west within the same village is considered *swagramabhigatadosha*. Similarly, the other three types should also be understood. This involves the *iryapatha* (path of travel) defect. || 440 ||

**Meaning:**  Any substance like medicine, ghee, sugar, etc., that is covered with mud, lac, or marked with a seal, should be given after being uncovered. If it is given while covered, it is considered *udbhinn* (contaminated). This is because there is a defect due to the entry of ants, etc. || 441 ||

**Meaning:**

If someone brings food offerings like *pūā* (a type of sweet) from a house located on an upper floor, reached by a ladder or staircase made of wood, and gives it to a monk, this is considered a *malarohaṇa* fault. This indicates an obstacle for the giver.

**Meaning:**

If a king, thief, or any householder, seeing the efforts of a monk in seeking alms, threatens the people saying, "If you don't give alms to these monks, we will take your wealth and drive you out of the village," then the alms given out of fear are considered *āchedya* (forced) and are a fault.

**Verse 444:**

Āge anīśārtha doṣako kahete hāi; aṇiṣaḍe puṇ duvihaṃ issaramaha ṇiṣṣaram caduviyappam | Paḍhamissara sārakkaṃ vattavattaṃ ca saṃghāḍam || 444 ||

**Meaning:**

Now, we will discuss the *anīśārtha* fault. *Anīśārtha* has two categories: *īśvara* (divine) and *anīśvara* (non-divine). These two categories further have four sub-categories. The first category, *īśvara*, is divided into *sārakṣa* (protected by a deity) and *vyakto'vyakta* (manifest and unmanifest) and *saṃghāṭa* (collective).

A wet nurse who bathes the child, adorns the child, plays with the child, breastfeeds the child, and sleeps with the child like a mother, if a Sadhu accepts food from such a person after being advised by them, then it is considered a Dhaatri Dosha. This leads to the destruction of the Khadyaya and creates a stain on the Sadhu's path. || 447 ||

**Water, Land, and Sky**

If a Sadhu travels from their own village and country to another village or country, by water (on a boat), land, or sky, and then accepts food after being advised by someone related to them, then it is considered a Doot Dosha. || 448 ||

**Eight Causes of Dosha**

The eight causes of Dosha are:

1. **Vyanjan:**  Food items like sesame seeds, mustard seeds, etc.
2. **Mang:**  Body parts like the head, etc.
3. **Sar:**  Broken sounds or harsh sounds.

**Kritikarma** is synonymous with **Vinaya**. Therefore, we will explain the meaning of **Vinaya**.

**578**  "**Vinaya**" is that which destroys the eight types of karma and liberates from the four realms of existence (Chaturangamoksha). Therefore, wise men call it **Vinaya**, which liberates from the cycle of birth and death.

Speaking in accordance with the fundamental principles of conduct, giving one's wealth appropriately according to the time and place, and showing respect to all beings, is called **Lokanuvritti Vinaya**. Folding one's hands for one's own purpose is called **Arthanimit Vinaya**. || 582 ||

Similarly, **Kamatantr Vinaya** is showing respect for the sake of the purpose of Kama (worldly desires), and **Bhayavinaya** is showing respect due to fear. The fifth **Vinaya**, **Mokshavinaya**, is now being explained. || 583 ||

**Mokshavinaya** is of five types: **Darshanavinaya**, **Jnanavinaya**, **Charitravinaya**, **Tapovinaya**, and **Aupacharik Vinaya**. This should be known. || 584 ||

**Verse 695:**

Neither horses, elephants, chariots, human strength, vehicles, mantras, medicines, knowledge, nor cunning strategies, nor even one's own family can provide refuge when death approaches.

When death approaches, even the gods, including Indra, cannot save us.  Consider the Jina's teachings as your refuge, your protection, and your path.

**261**

This living being, undergoing birth and death, experiences thousands of kinds of suffering in the realms of aquatic, terrestrial, aerial, animal, hellish, human, and divine existences. || 707 ||

Some of the experiences that gods and humans undergo are indeed pleasant, but the suffering in hell and animal realms is endless. || 708 ||

In this world, one experiences the effects of association and separation, gain and loss, pleasure and pain, honor and dishonor. || 709 ||

Page #299:

## 262

Knowing this world, which is full of many kinds of suffering, one should quickly consider it as insignificant. ||708-710||

Page #300:

##  Chapter 8: The Twelvefold Contemplation 

**Verse 713:**

The extent of the world is determined by the movement and stillness of living beings and matter. Beyond this, there is infinite space, devoid of any matter, called "aloka-akasha" (non-world space).

**Verse 714:**

This world is shaped like a "vetrasana" (a type of stool) in the lower region, a "jhallari" (a type of musical instrument) in the middle region, and a "mridanga" (a type of drum) in the upper region. Its total length is fourteen times the width of the middle region.

**Verse 715:**

In this world, living beings experience happiness and suffering, which are the results of their own actions. They are caught in the terrifying cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, endlessly traversing the ocean of existence.

## Chapter 8: Twelve Contemplations

**Verse 267**

Knowing this, attain detachment. Contemplate detachment in this way: Just as impurities leave this body, so too, there is no other good Dharma in the world besides the Dharma taught by the Jinas.  Even among the gods, demons, animals, and hell beings, there is no other Dharma that brings true happiness.  Contemplate this.

**Verse 726**

* मुक्त्वा जिनाख्यातं धर्म शुभमिह तु नास्ति लोके । ससुरासुरेषु तिर्यक्षु नरकमनुजेषु चिंतयेत् ॥ ७२६ ॥

जंतुः यत्तु निमज्जति कर्मास्रवहेतुकं सर्वं ।। ७२७ ॥

**Verse 729**

The Asravas are: attachment (raga), aversion (dvesha), delusion (moha), the five senses, and the five types of knowledge (indriya-sanjna), and the eight types of pride (garva-kashaya).  These Asravas, along with thoughts, words, and actions, are the cause of karma.

**731.**  Even those who have faith, always commit grave sins, which are the cause of an evil destiny. Therefore, those passions and aversions are to be condemned.

**732.**  It is difficult to control these sense objects without a concentrated mind. Just as a man without mantras and medicines cannot control poisonous snakes.

**733.**  Condemned are those senses, under whose control this being, having committed sins, obtains the fruits of those sins, which are infinite suffering in the four destinies.

These are all extremely difficult to find in the world. Even if one has obtained these, **Jina**'s teachings are not easily attained. This is because the world is filled with wrong paths, and **raga** (attachment) and **dvesha** (aversion) are very strong. (757)
