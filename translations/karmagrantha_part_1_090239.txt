One of the primary and creative objectives of the Shri Marudhar Kesari Sahitya Prakashan Samiti is to publish literature related to Jain religion and philosophy. The institution's guide, the highly revered Shri Marudhar Kesariji Maharaj, is himself a great scholar, a poet, and an expert in Jain Agamas and philosophy. Under his guidance, the institution's various philanthropic activities are flourishing. Gurudevshri is also an expert in literature and a devotee. Inspired by him, we have so far published discourses, biographies, poetry, Agamas, and profound analytical works. Now, we are presenting their long-awaited work, "Karmagranth Vivechan," to scholars and inquisitive readers.

"Karmagranth" is a great text of Jain philosophy. Its six parts contain a comprehensive discussion of Jain philosophy. Under the guidance of the revered Gurudevshri, renowned author-editor Shriyut Shrichandji Surana and his associate Shri Dev Kumarji Jain have jointly edited this beautifully. With the inspiration of Tapasvivar Shri Rajtamuni Ji and Vidya Vinod Shri Suknamuni Ji, this grand work is being completed on time in a beautiful manner. We express our heartfelt gratitude to all the scholars, Munivar, and supportive generous householders and hope that we will present the complete "Karmagranth Vivechan" to the readers in six parts, one after the other.

Second Edition
Two Words
While publishing a profound and deep text like 'Karmagranth', it seemed that there would be very few readers of such texts, hence instead of printing more copies, 1000 copies were printed. We printed 1200 copies and then published the complete set of Karmagranth from Part 2 to 6 in the same year and delivered it to the hands of the readers!
In a short span of four years, the first and second parts were completely finished and for the past year, there has been a constant demand for a new edition. This should be understood as the popularity of the simple and easy explanation of a complex text like Karmagranth. Many institutions have also included these parts in their curriculum. Students and inquisitive people are reading them with great enthusiasm. All this is an encouraging event for us.
Now, according to the demand of the readers, this second revised edition of Karmagranth is presented.
Despite the high cost of paper, printing, etc., keeping in mind the convenience of the readers, there has been no increase in the price. Hopefully, the readers will find it appropriate.
The new edition of the second part is also being presented soon.

## Editorial

The key to understanding Jain philosophy is the 'Karma Siddhanta'. It is certain that the soul is the foundation of the entire philosophy and metaphysics. And the 'Karma Siddhanta' reveals the mystery of the various states, forms, and transformations of the soul. Therefore, understanding the 'Karma Siddhanta' is essential for understanding Jain philosophy.

Among the major texts that discuss the 'Karma Siddhanta', the 'Karma Granth' (Parts 1 to 6) written by Shrimad Devendra Murti holds a special significance. It occupies a very important place in Jain literature. Even those who are curious about the truth consider the 'Karma Granth' as an object of daily study and self-study, like the Agamas. The Sanskrit commentaries on the 'Karma Granth' are very important. There have also been many Gujarati translations of it. The first commentary on the 'Karma Granth' in Hindi was presented by the learned sage, the great scholar, Pandit Sukhlalji. His commentary is comparative and scholarly. Pandit Sukhlalji's commentary is now almost unavailable. For some time, I was receiving inspiration from the Ashukavi Ratna Gurudev Shri Madhar Kesariji Maharaj to present a simple explanation of the 'Karma Granth' in a modern style. This editing began with his inspiration and guidance. With the inspiration of Vidya Vinod Shri Sukhanmuniji, this work progressed rapidly. The cooperation of Shri Devkumarji Jain was received, and the work became ready to take shape in a short time.

In this editing work, I received the support of the ancient text writers, commentators, commentators, and especially the works of Pandit Sukhlalji, due to which the commentary of such a profound text became easily understandable. I express my gratitude to all the scholars with immense gratitude.

---------------------------
I am deeply grateful for the guidance of Shri Marudhar Kaisariji M. from time to time, the inspiration of Shri Rajtamuni ji and Shri Sumanmuniji, and the cooperation of the officials of the Sahitya Samiti, especially the heartfelt inspiration and cooperation of the committee's administrator Shri Sujanmalji Sethia, which has brought dynamism to the editing and publication of this book. It would be entirely fitting for me to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.

If there are any errors, theoretical mistakes, ambiguities, or printing errors in the discussion, I apologize and request the kind readers to kindly point them out. Those who contribute to the removal of these errors are commendable. With this request, ...

With humility,
Shrichand Surana

The soul is the foundation of all contemplation, reflection, and analysis in Janadarshan. The soul is an all-powerful, independent force. It is both the creator of its own happiness and sorrow, and the one who experiences the fruits of its actions. The soul itself is formless, pure, but it is embodied in the body and wanders in the world in an impure state. Despite being inherently blissful, it is caught in the cycle of happiness and sorrow. Though immortal, it is swept away in the flow of birth and death. It is astonishing that the soul, which is supremely powerful, is also experiencing torment and suffering in the world as a poor, miserable, and destitute being. What is the reason for this?

Janadarshan, while examining this reason, says that karma is what causes the soul to wander in the world. Karma is the root of birth and death. "Kammam cha jai maranassa mulan" - this statement of Bhagwan Shri Mahavira is absolutely true, a fact. Due to karma, this world is constantly changing in various strange cycles of events. While theistic philosophies attribute the cause of this world's diversity and happiness and sorrow to God, Janadarshan considers the soul and its primary assistant, karma, as the root cause of all happiness and sorrow and the world's diversity. Karma itself is not an independent force; it is a pudgala, inert. But when karma is performed by the soul under the influence of attachment and aversion, it becomes so powerful and potent that it binds the doer in its own chains. It makes the master dance like a servant. This is the extraordinary power of karma. What is karma, the main seed of all changes in our life and the world, and what is its nature? How do its various results occur? This is a very serious subject.

Page #8:
---------------------------
Jainism extensively describes the concept of karma. A very detailed and subtle analysis of karma is found in the Jain Agamas and subsequent texts. These texts, written in Prakrit and Sanskrit, are accessible to scholars but difficult for the average seeker to understand. Ancient Acharyas have summarized the various aspects of karma theory in concise verses, which are beneficial for the average seeker to learn by heart.

The Karmagrantha holds a significant place among the ancient texts on karma theory. The six parts of this work, authored by Shrimad Devendrasuri, are extremely important. They cover all aspects of Jain philosophy, including karma theory, gunasthana, margam, jiva, ajiva, and their various classifications. The Karmagrantha is widely known for its commentary in Sanskrit and has also been explained in Gujarati. A renowned scholar, Pandit Sukhlalji, prepared a Hindi commentary on it about 40 years ago.

Currently, the Hindi commentary on the Karmagrantha was becoming difficult to obtain. Moreover, the style of commentary has also changed significantly over time. Many inquisitive monks and devotees had been requesting the revered Gumdev Marudhar Kesariji Maharaj Saheb for several years to provide a new commentary and publication of such a vast and profound text as the Karmagrantha. Only a capable scholar, learned, and venerable saint like you could accomplish this extremely laborious and expensive task. Gurudev was also drawn to this endeavor. His body has aged considerably. Despite this, he continues to engage in long pilgrimages, organize various institutions and programs, and dedicate over 10-12 hours daily to scriptural study, literary creation, etc. Last year, Gurudev resolved to take this work forward. He began writing the commentary. The responsibility of making the commentary beautiful and engaging in terms of language, style, etc., and compiling footnotes, citations from the Agamas, and writing the introduction was entrusted to the renowned scholar Shriyut Shrichandji Surana. Shri Surana is very close to Gurudev's literature and thoughts.

---------------------------
Under the guidance of Gurudev, they have prepared this scholarly and useful discourse for the general public through immense effort. This discourse fulfills a long-standing need. At the same time, society is receiving a cultural and philosophical treasure in a new form, which is a matter of great joy.
I have a special interest in this subject. I have been encouraging Gurudev and the editorial team to complete it from time to time. This first part is coming before the public today, and I am very happy about it.

## Introduction: A Review of the Doctrine of Karma

The fundamental substances of the universe: There are two types of substances in the visible universe. Both have their own existence, qualities, and processes. One type of substance is sentient, possessing desires, emotions, knowledge, and the experience of pleasure and pain. The other type is non-sentient, lacking the processes mentioned in the first type.

Every philosopher has acknowledged the separate existence of these two types of substances based on their qualities. In the language of science, the first type of substance is called conscious (Jiva) and the second type is called unconscious (Ajīva, inert, physical). The Jiva acts with its own emotional and active efforts, while the Ajīva substances act according to nature. They do not have their own personal effort or endeavor in their actions. This difference distinguishes them from each other.

The cause of variation: If every substance has its own qualities, then what is the reason for the diversity and strangeness we see? We only see the Jiva mixed with Ajīva. We do not see the pure form of either. This is a question that every philosopher has tried to answer from their own perspective.

Every substance's inherent nature and the action that corresponds to it, as well as the substance with similar qualities, is called homogeneous. The nature of that substance...

...involves variation, Ajīva or...

Page #20:
---------------------------
{20} A substance with a nature or action different from or opposite to that of another is called *vijātiya*. When substances with similar qualities come together, no change occurs. However, when substances with opposite qualities come together, they undergo change and are called *bikṛta*. This can be clearly seen through science and medicine. The reaction to the action of *vijātiya* substances is seen in the *rāja* itself.

In inanimate substances, contact with *vijātiya* substances also produces change, but because their action occurs naturally according to natural laws, they do not try to react on their own. However, living substances have the special characteristic that, even while coming into contact with *vijātiya* substances, they do not tolerate the contact of these *vijātiya* substances and strive to remove them. They begin to try to remove the *vijātiya* substances that have come into contact with their senses, which are formed by their own contact, and they do not rest until these *vijātiya* substances are removed. The implication is that living beings are affected by contact with *vijātiya* substances, and the contact of *vijātiya* substances is the cause of change.

The theoretical implication of this statement is that for a living being, non-living matter is *vijātiya*. When non-living matter comes into contact with a living being, it produces change in the living being. The contact of non-living matter with a living being and the resulting action can be described in philosophical terms as *karma* or other synonymous terms.

Various words that denote *karma*

The word *karma* is used both in common parlance and in scriptures. Ordinary people use the word *karma* in the sense of work, business, action, etc. in their worldly dealings. In scriptures, the word *karma* is used in various senses. For example, the word *karma* is used for any movement, whether it be of a living being or a non-living being, such as eating, drinking, walking, etc. *Karmakāṇḍī* *Mīmāṃsaka* use the word *karma* in the sense of rituals, sacrifices, etc.

Page #21:
---------------------------
(21)
The term "karma" is used in the sense of the fixed duties (actions) of the four varnas (Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra) and the four ashramas (Brahmacharya, Grihastha, Vanaprastha, Sanyasa), in the sense of the fruit of the grammarian's work, which falls on the meaning of the Vedic rituals, vows, rules, etc., in the sense of the five symbolic actions of Vaisheshika (utkshepan, etc.), and in the sense of action in the context of counting. The term "karma" is also used in the sense of the cause of rebirth. The term "vand" is used for that. Similar meanings are found in the Jain scriptures for "bhaga," "vasana," "aashya," "dharma-adharma," "ashta-sanskar," "dev," "bhagya." In Jain scriptures, the terms "avidya," "prakriti," "apatram," etc., are found to have similar meanings.

I

There are many words like "daiva," "bharatra," "punya," "papa," etc., which are common to all philosophies, but the three words "maya," "avidya," and "prakriti" are found in Vedanta philosophy. The root meaning of "vanka" is almost the same as what is called "bhatrakam" in Jain scriptures.

The word "apuurva" is found in Mimamsa philosophy. This philosophy believes that the creation of non-existent things happens in the material world according to the past karma of souls. Karma is an independent power that drives the world. When a person performs a yajna or other karma, a power is generated, which is called "apuurva." It is due to this "apuurva" that the fruit of any karma is received in the future at the appropriate time.

The word "vasana" is famous in Buddhist philosophy. In the four noble truths of Buddhist philosophy, while explaining the causes of suffering, the four noble truths, it is said that the effect of all the past actions of a human being in the last birth remains in the last stage of life, and according to karma, "sanskaras" are formed. These "sanskaras" are called "vasana," which continue to flow.

The word "vasana" is also used in Yoga philosophy as a synonym for karma. There, while explaining the nature of God, it is said that all the beings of the world suffer due to ignorance, ego, desire, attachment-aversion, and clinging.

Page #22:
---------------------------
(22) They perform various actions and experience happiness and sorrow as a result of their consequences or fruits. They are also influenced by the inherent impressions of past lives. The tradition of these past life impressions is also called Basana or Karma. In addition, the term 'Ashaya' is also used in Yoga Darshan to explain the meaning of Karma. The term Ashaya is also found in the Saanspadarshan.
Generally, the terms Dharma-Adharma, Ashta, and Sanskar are also used in other Darshanas. But mainly these two words have been used in Nyaya and Vaisheshik Darshanas.
Darshanas that believe in rebirth, called Atmajati Darshanas, have to accept Karma for the realization of rebirth. Due to the different processes of these Darshanas, or due to the difference in opinion, the nature of Karma has been understood differently. It is certain that the Atmavadis have used the aforementioned terms like Basana, Karma, etc. to explain Karma.
We will further elaborate on the meaning of the term Karma as accepted by Jain Darshan. The views of different Darshanas on Karma and its consequences.
The contemplation of Karma and its fruits is an inherent tendency of human life. Every individual wants to see what the result of whatever he does is? Based on this experience, he also decides what actions he should perform to achieve what results. Thus, the entire historical, social, and religious thinking of human civilization has been making Karma and its fruits its subject of thought in some form or the other.
From the point of view of thinking about Karma and its fruits, all the Darshanas of the world can be divided into two parts. One Darshan is those who believe that the cause-and-effect tradition related to Karma is limited to this life only. They do not believe that after the destruction of this body, its actions continue in the tradition.

Page #23:
---------------------------
(23) It continues. According to them, all activities related to life begin with the combination of the five elements (Panchabhuta) from the time of the being's conception or birth and end with the destruction of the body at the end of life, when these activities merge back into the five elements. Philosophies that hold such beliefs are called materialistic.

In contrast, there is another type of philosophy that believes that within the body composed of the five elements, there exists another element - the Jiva or Atma. This Atma is eternal and infinite. Its taking on and discarding of a particular physical body during its endless journey through the world is merely an incidental event. The Atma, through its physical body, constantly creates new karmas through various mental, verbal, and physical actions. It experiences the fruits of these karmas and accordingly enters one womb after another until, through these specific actions, it purifies itself and attains liberation from this cycle of birth and death, becoming a Siddha. Achieving such liberation or Siddhi is the ultimate goal of human life. Philosophies that accept such beliefs are called spiritual.

Among these two types of ideologies, some spiritual philosophers have considered the Jiva to be not an independent enjoyer of the fruits of karma and have not considered creation to be eternal, but rather to have originated at some point in time. They have also established a definite time for destruction along with creation and have connected God in some form or another to its creation and destruction. The viewpoint of some of them is as follows:

The Nyaya philosophy states that the fruits of good and bad karma are received through the inspiration of God. God is the creator, sustainer, and destroyer of the universe. He does not create the world from nothing, but rather from eternal atoms, space, time, air, mind, and souls. He is also the sustainer of the world, as the world continues to exist according to his will. He is also the destroyer of the world, because whenever the world needs to be destroyed for religious purposes...

Page #24:
---------------------------
(24)
When the need arises, he also destroys. Although God has to become according to the sins and virtues of man in order to provide fruits, yet he is omnipotent. Man is the doer of his own actions, but he acts under the influence or instigation of God according to his adrishta (past karma). Thus, God is the administrator of the karma of the beings of the world, both human and non-human, the giver of the fruits of their karma and the judge of their happiness and sorrow.

According to the Vaisheshika Darshan, the creator of the universe and the world is Maheshwar. By his will, the universe is created and by the same will, it is destroyed. When he wills, the universe comes into being, so that all beings can enjoy happiness and sorrow according to their karma, and when he wills, he folds up that net. This flow of creation and dissolution has been going on since time immemorial. Sridhi means the destruction of the old order and the creation of the new. Keeping in mind the past karma of the beings (past sins and virtues), God creates a new creation. Brahma or Vishwatma, who is the repository of infinite knowledge, detachment and wealth, rotates the cycle of the universe in such a way that beings experience happiness and sorrow according to their past dharma and adharma.

1
In Yoga Darshan, the manifestation of nature from the foundation of God is considered to be the spread of the inert world. In Yoga Darshan, God is the Supreme Person, who is above all beings and free from all defects, he is eternal, omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent and the perfect Supreme Being. All the beings of the world suffer due to ignorance, ego, desire, attachment-aversion and attachment to life (fear of death), etc.

The universe is created by the union of Purusha and Prakriti and is destroyed by their separation. Prakriti and Purusha are two different elements. Their union or separation cannot happen naturally. For this, one has to assume an efficient cause, which is infinitely intelligent and can bring about the union or separation of Purusha from Prakriti according to the adrishta of the beings. The Jivatma or Purusha does not know his own self, therefore it is necessary to believe in an omniscient Supreme Being who...

Page #25:
---------------------------
It is necessary that there be a being who, according to the unseen karmas of living beings, creates or destroys the world, causing the union and separation of purusha and prakriti. The one who accomplishes this task is God, without whose inspiration nature cannot develop the world in a way that is conducive to the self-elevation and liberation of living beings.

In Vedanta philosophy, Sri Shankaracharya, in his Brahma Sutra Bhashya, based on the Upanishads, has established Brahma as the cause of creation. The description of the creator in different Upanishads, though not identical, generally agrees that the soul (Brahma or Atman) is both the efficient and material cause of the world. Regarding the beginning of creation, the opinion of most Upanishads is that in the beginning (Adi) there was only the soul. It occurred to him, "I will become many, I will create the universe," and creation took place. Brahma creates this universe through the power of Maya, which resides within him.

Contrary to all these hypotheses, Jain philosophy does not consider God to be the instigator of karma for the purpose of making living beings experience the fruits of their actions, because just as a living being is free to perform actions, so too is it free to experience their fruits. If God were considered the giver of karmic fruits, then the good and bad actions performed by the living being itself would be rendered futile. Because if we perform bad actions, can anyone, no matter how powerful, make us happy? Similarly, if we perform good actions, can he make us unhappy? If so, then performing good actions and fearing bad actions is pointless for us, because the fruits of our actions are not under our control. And if it is true that we must experience the fruits of our good and bad actions ourselves, then the idea of divine intervention is pointless, because the living being itself experiences the fruits of its own actions.

"Always, eternally, one's own actions are the cause of one's birth, death, life, sorrow, and happiness. It is a falsehood that another is the cause of one's birth, death, life, sorrow, and happiness."

Page #26:
---------------------------
(26)
Therefore, to believe that anyone, even God, is the creator of the happiness and sorrow, life and death of others is merely an imagination, pure ignorance. Acharya Amitagati has clearly stated this:

"
*Self-created karma, whatever is done by the soul in the past, its good and bad fruits are received by itself.*
"
*If it is clearly received from another, then self-created karma is meaningless.*
"
*Leaving aside the karma done by oneself, no one gives anything to anyone.*
"
*Thinking and contemplating, one should abandon the idea that another gives, and be free from the rest.*

Even when tested by the yardstick of logic, the creator of the world, God, etc., is not proven. So many questions arise about him that neither the existence of the world is proven nor is it possible for an infinite variety of the world to be created by one. In fact, every being is the creator of its own individual world. That is why Jainism does not consider God as the creator of the universe, because the universe is eternal and infinite, it has never been created in a new form, and since it is itself subject to change, it does not require the support of God.

**Objections and Refutations to the Karma Theory**

There are some objections to the Karma theory from those who believe in God as the creator or motivator. These can be divided into the following categories:

I
(1) Just as small and big things in the world, like palaces and houses, are created by someone, so there must be a creator of the entire universe, which appears in the form of work.
(2) All beings perform good and bad karma, but no one desires the fruit of bad karma, and karma itself is inert and unable to bear fruit without the motivation of any conscious being. Therefore, God should be considered as the cause of the experience of the fruits of karma.

Page #27:
---------------------------
(3) God should be a being who is eternally liberated and possesses some special qualities beyond liberated beings. Therefore, the belief of karma theory that everyone becomes liberated, i.e., God, upon liberation from karma is not correct.
Jain objections: We do not agree.
(1) This world has always existed, it was not created at any point in time. Changes certainly keep happening. Many changes are such that they require the effort of a human or other living being, and other changes are seen that do not require anyone's effort. They are formed automatically due to various combinations and separations of inert elements, therefore there is no need or utility in considering God as the creator.
(8) It is true that karma is inert and beings do not want the fruits of every bad karma they do, but it should be noted that due to the association of the living being (jīva), a kind of power is generated in karma, which causes it to manifest its good and bad consequences at the appointed time.
Karma theory does not believe that inert karma is capable of producing results without the connection of the conscious being, but it believes that there is no need to assume the inspiration of a God-like conscious being for the results to occur, because all living beings are conscious.
And they develop a mind according to the karma they perform, which causes them to perform such actions that lead them to experience the fruits of their karma, even if they do not desire the fruits of bad karma. Performing karma and not desiring its fruits are two different situations, simply not wanting it cannot stop the fruits of the performed karma from being experienced. When the materials are gathered, the work starts happening on its own, like a person standing in the sun, feeling thirsty, and wishing not to feel thirsty, can thirst be stopped in any way? If the theistic God-believers say that karma manifests its fruits on beings due to the will of God, then the answer is that at the time of performing karma, such impressions are left in the jīva according to the results, which inspire the jīva to experience the fruits of karma on its own.

Page #28:
---------------------------
(3)  Jiva and Ishvara - both are conscious, then what is the difference between them? The only difference can be that all the powers of the jiva are covered by the karmic coverings, but not those of Ishvara. However, when the jiva removes the coverings through its own efforts, all its powers become fully illuminated. There is no difference between jiva and Ishvara. If the difference remains even after the removal of the karmic coverings, then what is liberation? The difference is limited to the cycle of samsara, not beyond. Therefore, there is no objection in believing that all liberated jivas are Ishvara. It is not appropriate to say that Ishvara should be only one, just on the basis of imagination. There are many souls and they are all Ishvara from the tattvic point of view. They are seen as small and big jivas only due to the karmic coverings. This principle gives full strength to everyone to manifest their Ishvaratva and inspires them to make efforts.

The existence of the soul - seven proofs

Who binds karma and who experiences its fruits? The answer is the soul. While considering the soul-substance, it is necessary to accept the existence of the soul, otherwise the discussion of karma will not be considered logical. The independent existence of the soul is proved by the following seven proofs:

(1) The proof of self-awareness, (2) The absence of contradictory evidence, (3) The proof of the negator from the negation, (4) The proof of the effect from the cause, (5) The scriptural evidence, (6) The consensus of modern scholars, (7) Rebirth. The discussion of these proofs is as follows:

Page #29:
---------------------------
(1) **Self-awareness as evidence -** Although all embodied beings are more or less enveloped by the veil of ignorance and doubt their own existence, when their intellect becomes even slightly stable, they experience the realization, "I am not." This is contradicted by the certainty, "I am." This is what Shri Shankaracharya also said, "All souls experience their existence, not 'I am not'." This certainty is called self-awareness or self-realization.

(2) **Refutation of obstructive evidence -** There is no evidence that negates the existence of the soul. If it is doubted that the inability of the mind and senses to perceive the soul is obstructive evidence, then the solution is simple. Because obstructive evidence is considered to be that which has the power to know the object and, even when all other materials are present, cannot perceive it. For example, the eye can see an earthen pot. But if, even when light, proximity, etc. are present, it does not see the pot, then it should be considered an obstruction to that object.

The senses are all physical. Their power of perception is finite. They can only superficially know the terrestrial, nearby, and fixed objects from among physical objects. Microscopes, etc. are also in a similar state. They have so far only been proven to work on physical objects, and even then not completely. Therefore, their inability to know the non-physical, non-material soul cannot be called obstructive. Even though the mind is subtle and physical, it becomes a slave to the senses - one after another, it runs around like monkeys in many objects, then Rajas and Tamas qualities are generated in it. The Sattvic quality does not manifest. This is also mentioned in the Gita.

Page #30:
---------------------------
"The senses wander, and the mind follows them, just as the wind carries a boat. When the mind is free to roam, it takes the intellect along with it."

"Therefore, the soul does not shine brightly in a restless mind. It is observed that just as a mirror possesses the power to reflect, but when it becomes tarnished, it cannot reflect any object, similarly, the unstable mind, which runs after external objects, does not perceive the soul, not because of any obstacle, but simply due to its own weakness."

"Thus, it is proven that the mind, senses, microscopes, and all other instruments, being material, do not have the power to negate the soul."

"(3) Proof of Existence from Negation - Some people argue that we cannot be certain about the soul, but only experience its absence at times, because sometimes thoughts arise in the mind like 'I am not' etc. However, they should understand that this very thought proves the existence of the soul, because how can such a thought arise if there is no soul? The one who is negating is the soul itself. Shankaracharya has stated this in his commentary on the Brahma Sutras: 'The one who negates is indeed the self, its own nature.' (2.3.137)"

"(4) Logic - This also supports the independent existence of the soul. It states that in the world, every object has an opposite. For example, darkness has light as its opposite, heat has cold, and pleasure has pain. Similarly, there must be a conscious entity that is the opposite of inert matter."

Page #31:
---------------------------
(

)
Logic is not invalid in the absence of proof, but rather such logic is a sign of pure intellect. That which is the opposite of inert is conscious or the soul.
—
It can be argued that it is not appropriate to consider inert and conscious as two opposing independent principles, but it is appropriate to consider both inert and conscious powers in one type of fundamental substance. When the power of consciousness begins to develop, it is expressed, at which time the power of inertness disappears. All beings with conscious power are simply names for the development of inert matter! There is no existence of sages, but due to the feeling of self-power, they appear in the form of living beings. This is the same view of Hegel and other Western scholars. But it is not impossible to refute this adverse argument.
It is seen that when one power emerges in an object, the other opposing power disappears in it. But the power that disappears is not forever, it will emerge again when favorable conditions are created. Similarly, the power that has reappeared is not forever. It disappears when unfavorable conditions are encountered. For example, take the molecules of water, when they get heat, they turn into steam, then when cold and other conditions are encountered, they rain down in the form of water and when they become more cold, they leave the liquid form and acquire density in the form of ice.
All inert matter today
Similarly, if we consider both inertness and consciousness as two powers in one fundamental principle, then evolution will not be able to stand because the beings that are considered conscious today due to the development of the power of consciousness, will become inert again when that power develops, and the stones, etc., which appear in the form of inertness, will also become conscious someday, and the humans, animals, birds, etc., who appear in the conscious form, will also become inert someday. Therefore, it is right to consider inert and conscious as two independent principles, rather than considering both opposing powers of inertness and consciousness in one substance.

Page #32:
---------------------------
(32)
(5) **Scriptural Authority** - Many ancient scriptures advocate the independent existence of the soul. Those scriptural scholars who have investigated the subject of the soul with great peace and seriousness, if we dismiss their scriptural experiences without experiencing them ourselves, whose fault is it? Nowadays, we see many great souls who have spent their lives in contemplation of the soul. If we do not accept their pure experiences based on our own deluded experiences, then the deficiency lies with us. Ancient scriptures and contemporary experienced great souls are selflessly revealing the existence of the soul.
(6) **Agreement of Modern Scientists** - Nowadays, people often want to know the opinion of scientific scholars to clarify every subject. It is true that many Western physicists do not believe in the soul, but they are doubtful about it. However, there are many great scientists who have spent their entire lives in the pursuit of physical thought, but their vision has also reached beyond the physical to the essence of the soul. Among them, Sir Oliver Lodge and Lord Kelvin are famous in the scientific world. Both these scholars are in favor of considering the conscious principle as connected to the material. They have refuted the arguments of materialists with great care. Their view is that without the independent existence of consciousness, the unique structure of living beings cannot be formed. I do not consider the brain to be the root of knowledge, like other materialists, but I consider it to be merely a means of the emergence of knowledge.
The world-renowned scientist Dr. Jagadish Chandra Bose's research has established that plants also possess memory. Through his discoveries, he has compelled the scientific world to accept the independent soul principle.
(7) **Rebirth** - There are many questions here that cannot be fully answered without accepting rebirth.

Page #33:
---------------------------
(33)
Consider
The suffering a child endures from the beginning of conception to birth. Are these the result of the child's actions or those of their parents? The child has not done anything good or bad during their gestation. If we say it is the result of the parents' actions, it seems inconsistent, because why should the child suffer the consequences of their parents' good or bad actions without reason? To believe that the child experiences all their joys and sorrows without reason is the height of ignorance, because it is impossible for anything to happen without a cause. If it is said that the parents' diet, conduct, and physical and mental states begin to affect the child from the time of conception, then the question arises again: why did the child get such parents? And what is the solution to the fact that sometimes the child's abilities are completely different from those of their parents? Many examples are seen where the parents are completely illiterate and the child becomes fully educated. In fact, it is even seen that the child becomes proficient in something that the parents have absolutely no interest in. This cannot be attributed solely to the surrounding environment, because even with similar circumstances and equal care, differences in thought and behavior are seen among many students. If it is said that this is the result of the child's extraordinary knowledge-fibers, then there is doubt about this: the child's body is formed from the parents' Shukra and Shonit, then where did these non-existent knowledge-fibers come from in the child's brain? Sometimes the parents' intellectual abilities are seen in the child, it is true, but even in this there is a question: why did such a fortunate opportunity arise? In some places, it is also seen that the parents' abilities are very high, and even with their best efforts, the child remains a simpleton.
It is well known that even two children born together are not the same. Even with equal care from the parents, one is ordinary

Page #34:
---------------------------
This one lives and that one goes far ahead. One is freed from yellow disease and the other shakes hands with great wrestlers. One lives long and the other becomes a guest of Yama even after a hundred efforts. One's desire is fulfilled and the other's is not. The power that was in Mahavira, Buddha and Shankaracharya was not in their parents. Hemchandracharya's parents cannot be considered because of his image. His guru was also not the main reason for his brilliance, because Devchandra Suri had other disciples besides him. Then what is the reason that people don't even know the names of other disciples and Hemchandracharya's name is famous? The unique power that is seen in Mrs. Annie Besant was not in her parents and not in her daughter either.

Considering the above examples, it becomes clear that all the extraordinary things seen in this birth are neither the result of the work of the present birth, nor the strength of the parents, nor only the circumstances. Therefore, the limit of the existence of the soul should be considered even before the beginning of the womb. That is the previous birth. The impressions accumulated by desire or tendency in the previous birth, on the basis of them, the above doubts and anomalies are solved consistently. By the same method by which one previous birth is proved, the tradition of many previous births is also proved, because unlimited knowledge cannot be the result of the practice of one birth. Thus, the soul is proved to be eternal, different from the body. The eternal element is never destroyed, this principle is accepted by all philosophers. It is also said in the Gita:

Naasato vidyate bhavo na bhavo vidyate sataha. - Geeta, Chapter 2, Verse 16

Not only this, but many questions cannot be solved without accepting the existence of the soul after the present body. There are many people who live a righteous life in this birth, but they remain poor, and others are also seen who get irritated even after hearing the name of justice, morality and religion, but they are happy in every way. Many such individuals can be found who are themselves...

Page #35:
---------------------------
The guilty and their sins are being borne by others. One commits murder and another is caught and hanged. One steals and another is caught.

We should also consider that those who did not receive the fruits of their good or bad deeds in this life, will their deeds simply fail? To say that deeds do not fail, even if the doer does not receive the fruit, it still affects the upper society or other people of the country—this is also not right, because whatever a human being does, he does not do it all for others. Even the great souls who are engaged in charity day and night, their desire is only to manifest their divine self for the benefit of others. Desire has a very high place in the order of the universe. In such a situation, it is not reasonable to assume that the root of desire is also destroyed along with the present body. A human being continues to strive until the last moment of his life, so that he may benefit himself. It is not that all those who do this are deluded. Even the accomplished, steady-minded, peaceful, wise yogis are engaged in trying to achieve their goal with the same thought, that if not in this life, then in the next life, at some point we will manifest the divine nature.

If the existence of karma is not accepted after the destruction of the body, how narrow does the purpose of the individual become and how small does the scope of work become? You can think about it yourself. Whatever is done for others cannot be equal to the work done for oneself! Accepting the afterlife of the conscious being until the last moment of the present body, in a way, forces the individual to give up ambition. If not in this life, then in the next life, but I will surely achieve my purpose—this feeling can manifest more power in the human heart than any other feeling. It cannot be said that the said feeling is false, because its emergence is natural and well-known.

Page #36:
---------------------------
(36)
It is not possible to be content without acknowledging that the soul is an independent entity, considering all these points. Whatever good or bad karma it performs, knowingly or unknowingly, it has to bear its fruits, and therefore it has to go through the cycle of rebirth. The Tathagata Buddha also believed in rebirth. The karma-chakra-created rebirth is accepted. This acceptance of rebirth is strong evidence for accepting the independent existence of the soul.

**Some Special Things to Know About the Soul**

From the above references, it becomes clear that the soul's existence is eternal and infinite. It was never created and will never be destroyed. It is eternal. One might question how we can accept its existence when it is not visible in any way. In this regard, it can be said that seeing, touching, etc., are properties of physical matter. But the soul is not physical matter, it is non-physical, so it should not be imagined to be seen or touched. It can only be known through experience.

It is generally said that we see with our eyes, hear with our ears, etc. But this is not true. These senses are merely instruments; the actual power to perceive objects lies in the soul. It is the soul that performs the actions of seeing, touching, etc., through these senses.

Another fact worth considering in this regard is that eyes can only see, ears can only hear, nose can only smell, tongue can only taste sour-sweet, etc., and skin can only feel cold-hot, etc. If we close our eyes, we cannot see with any other part of the body; if we close our ears, we cannot hear with any other part of the body, and so on. But there is something inside our body that can see, hear, smell, etc., simultaneously. This power is called the soul or consciousness.

The unique power that exists can...

Page #37:
---------------------------
37)
The characteristic of the soul is knowledge. We can say that wherever the soul is, there is knowledge, that is, knowing. Knowledge and the soul are inseparable. Every living being, whether it be a human being or an animal or a microscopic insect, has knowledge. It is another matter that due to the different types of karmic coverings on different souls, there may be more or less knowledge in different beings, but it never happens that where there is a soul, there is no knowledge.
If we consider knowledge to be the characteristic of the body, then there should be more knowledge in a large body and less knowledge in a small body. But this is contrary to experience. In addition, we would have to accept the existence of knowledge in a corpse, which is not the case.
We can compare the knowledge-quality of the soul to the light of the sun and the karmic covering to the clouds. Although the sun is emitting light, we cannot see the sun when clouds come. If the clouds are dense, we get very little light, and as the density of the clouds decreases, we get more and more light. The same thing should happen in the case of the development of knowledge and the karmic covering.
Light is in its entirety
Light is in its entirety
Every living being exhibits emotions such as joy, sorrow, love, hatred, etc. These emotions are not of the physical body of the living being. If these emotions were the qualities of physical matter, they should have been found in all physical matter at all times; but this is not the case. Like consciousness, these emotions are only found in living beings. Therefore, these emotions also make us aware of some immaterial substance present in the body, and that immaterial substance is called the soul.
There is no obstacle to the existence of countless souls in one region, because the soul is an immaterial substance. It does not have form, taste, smell, touch - which are the qualities of physical matter. Therefore, at the same time, in the same place, one
-
.

Page #38:
---------------------------
There is no obstacle in the existence of countless souls together. Just as the light of a lamp in a room can exist, and the light of thousands of other lamps can also exist in the same room without any hindrance, similarly, there is no obstacle in countless souls existing together in the same place at the same time, completely independent of each other.

Each soul has its own body-size - neither less nor more. The soul has the quality of shrinking and expanding, therefore it becomes the size of the body it receives as a result of its actions, just as the light of a lamp is limited to a small room when placed in it, and when the same lamp is placed in a large room, its light spreads throughout the large room. Similarly, one should understand the existence of the soul in the body of an ant and a giant.

**The Atemporal Nature of Karma**

From the above discussion, it becomes clear that the soul's existence is eternal and bound by karma. So, naturally, a question arises in the human mind: which came first, the soul or karma? Which is older and which is younger, or is karma also eternal like the soul? If the soul is older, then the bond of karma with it would also have to be considered eternal. In response to this question, the Jain scriptures say that karma is eternal in relation to the individual, but atemporal in relation to its flow. It is everyone's experience that beings sleep, wake up, rise, sit, walk, fall, and perform various actions. This action itself is the cause of karma-bondage. This proves that karma is eternal in relation to the individual. But no one knows or can tell when the flow of karma began. Just as the future is infinite, so is the past. There is no other way to describe infinity except by the words "eternal" or "infinite".

Page #39:
---------------------------
It is impossible for something to come into existence by a word. Therefore, there is no other way but to say that the flow of karma is anadi (without beginning). _Some people, frightened by the confusion of the unclear explanation of anadi, start changing the flow of karma to sadi (with beginning), but in an attempt to remove the fear of a fault imagined by their own intellect, they accept another bigger fault. If they accept the beginning of the flow of karma, then the jiva (soul) should have been extremely pure and enlightened before, then what is the reason for its involvement? And if even the completely pure and enlightened jiva gets involved, then even the liberated jivas will be involved in karma, and in that situation, liberation should be called the sleeping world. The anadi nature of the flow of karma and the non-return of liberated jivas to the world has been accepted by all the established darshanas (philosophies)._

For the solution of the anadi relationship of karma with the soul and bhakti (devotion) in comparison to the flow-lineage, the Acharyas (teachers) have said:

> _Jo khatu sansaratyo jivo tatto du hodi parinamo parinamaado kamma kammaado hovi gavi sugavi. Gadim adhigavassa deho dehaavo indiyani jayante. Tehi duvi sayaggahanam tato rago doso va. Jadi jivas sevam bhavo sansara dhakka valammi._

> _Di jinavarehi manido anadinidhanu sanidhanu va._

The anadi relationship of karma with the jiva can be understood by this example: just as within a mine, gold and stone, milk and ghee, egg and hen, seed and tree have an anadi relationship, in the same way, the relationship of jiva and karma should be known as self-evident in comparison to the flow-lineage. That is, the mind, speech, and

Page #40:
---------------------------
There is pulsation in the body and there is motion. When there is motion, the body and the senses take in objects and then from these feelings of attachment and aversion, the cycle of the world continues. 
From that, due to the influx of karma, motion, etc., senses are formed in the body, from them, the taking in of objects, attachment and aversion are continuously produced.
Even though it is beginningless, is there an end to karma?
It is a general rule that what is beginningless can never be destroyed. But this rule is not applicable in the case of the beginningless relationship between karma and the soul. There is a beginningless relationship between gold and earth, milk and ghee, yet they are seen to be separated by special effort. Similarly, the beginningless relationship between the soul and karma also ends. It is to be remembered that no karma is beginningless in itself, no particular karma has a beginningless relationship with the soul. When the previous karmic situation is complete, it is separated from the soul and a new karma is bound. In this way, even though karma is beginningless in the form of a stream, it is not beginningless individually, and by the destruction of the stream of karma through austerity and restraint, the soul is liberated. Thus, the beginningless tradition of karma is destroyed by special efforts and the binding of new karma does not happen again.
Who is stronger, the soul or karma?
Even though karma is beginningless, the soul destroys karma by its own efforts. Therefore, the power of the soul is infinite compared to karma. From the outside, karma appears to be powerful and the soul, being under the control of karma, keeps revolving in the cycle of birth and death in various species, but when seen from within, the power of the soul is limitless. Just as it binds itself to karma by its own actions and gets entangled in them, it also has the capacity to destroy karma.
No matter how powerful karma may seem, the soul is more powerful than them. Just as a stone appears hard and water appears soft from a worldly perspective, but that water also breaks large rocks into pieces

Page #41:
---------------------------

It breaks it into pieces. In the same way, the power of the soul is infinite. Until it becomes aware of its own vast consciousness-power, it considers karma to be more powerful than itself and remains subject to it. As soon as it gains knowledge, it strives to be free from it and attains the pure, enlightened and perfected state. This is the spiritual principle.

**Relationship of Karma Theory with Other Scriptures**

**Spiritual Science**

- The purpose of spiritual science is to consider matters related to the soul. Therefore, before describing the transcendental nature of the soul, it is necessary to state its practical nature. If this is not done, the question naturally arises in the mind: how can one acquire the ability and vision to know the true nature of the soul without knowing the nature of the visible states of the soul, such as man, animal, bird, happiness, sorrow, etc.? Besides this, there is also the question: why are the visible present states not the nature of the soul? Therefore, it is necessary for spiritual science to first show the origin of the visible form of the soul and then proceed. This work has been done by karma science. It shows the visible states of being as karmic and informs us of the soul's distinct nature from it. From this perspective, karma science is a part of spiritual science.

If the purpose of spiritual science is considered to be only to describe the pure nature of the soul, even then karma science has to be considered its first step. The reason for this is that until the relationship of the soul with the present states experienced is explained, how can the vision move forward? When it becomes known that all the forms above (present) are illusory or phenomenal, then the curiosity arises as to what is the true nature of the soul. At that time, the presentation of the pure nature of the soul alone becomes meaningful.

To show the relationship of the soul with the Supreme Soul is also the subject of spiritual science. Just as thoughts are found in the Upanishads, Gita, etc. regarding this relationship, so also in karma science. Karma science says that the soul is the Supreme Soul - the living being.

This is God. The merging of the soul with the Supreme Soul means that the soul, becoming free from karma, realizes its Supreme Soul nature and becomes permeated with the Supreme Soul. The soul is a part of the Supreme Soul, which means, from the perspective of karma-shastra, that the soul possesses all knowledge and skills, but it is only a fraction of the complete, yet veiled (covered) consciousness-moonlight. When the veil of karma is removed, consciousness manifests in its fullness. This should be understood as the attainment of God-consciousness or Godhood.

To consider oneself as the body, wealth, possessions, etc., i.e., to identify with the non-self, is an external perspective. Karma-shastra teaches to abandon this false belief by realizing the true nature of the soul. Even though those whose karmic impressions are solely focused on the external self may not find the teachings of karma-shastra appealing, it does not diminish its truth.

Karma-shastra reveals the distinction between the body and the soul, dispelling the illusion of their oneness, and brings forth the knowledge of this distinction, the wisdom of discrimination. At this point, the inner vision opens up. Through this inner vision, one sees the Supreme Soul nature within oneself. To fully experience this Supreme Soul nature is to become Shiva (Brahman). Karma-shastra has taken upon itself the task of revealing this Brahman alone. Because it aims to guide the soul from the illusion of oneness to the realization of distinction, towards the higher state of natural non-dual knowledge. At the same time, the main subject matter of yoga-shastra is also found within it. Therefore, it is clear that karma-shastra is a mine of various spiritual and philosophical ideas. This is its significance.

Karma has the closest connection with the body and the soul. Karma-shastra describes the impure state of the soul, its causes, etc., before it becomes pure and free from karma. In its impure state, the soul has a body, senses, etc. Therefore, these are also described in karma-shastra in their respective places. While the elements of body formation, its gross and subtle forms, its growth and decay, etc., are discussed in physiology, and in fact, this is the domain of physiology,

Page #43:
---------------------------
The subject is, but in Karmaśāstra also, incidentally, many things are described which are related to the body.
Even though the things related to the body in Karma-siddhānta are said from an ancient method, their importance does not diminish just because of that. The main thing to see is that in Karmaśāstra, the structure of the body, its types, its strength, and the elements that are its cause, have been systematically stated, and by researching them, newness can also be brought and the importance of the scripture can also be proved.
Language-Śāstra-Similarly, in Karmaśāstra, there is also a discussion worth considering regarding language and the senses. From what element is language formed, how much time does it take to form? For its creation, it uses various japalo pani in different ways and by what means does it do so? What is the basis of the truth and falsehood of language? Which creatures can speak? Which species of creature has the power to speak in what kind of language? etc. Important and serious consideration of questions related to language is found in Karmaśāstra in a detailed manner.
Similarly, how many senses are there, what are they like, what are their various differences and what are their powers? Which creature has how many senses? What is the relationship between external and internal senses, what is their shape, etc.? Many kinds of thoughts related to the senses are found in Karmaśāstra.
It may be that all these thoughts may not be found in it in a systematic manner, but it should be kept in mind that the main subject of Karmaśāstra is something else, and in the context of its description, the body, language, senses, etc. have been considered as needed. Therefore, it is possible that a systematic compilation may not have been possible, but this does not prove the fault of Karmaśāstra, rather it will be called the glory of discussing the subject of many scriptures.

The Purpose of the Doctrine of Karma: Its Objective
In response to the question of why the doctrine of karma came into being, from a practical perspective, the following three main purposes can be stated:
(1) To remove the erroneous aspects of the Vedic religion's belief in God. (2) To clarify the inadequacy of Buddhism's momentary nihilism. (3) To establish the principle that karma is the cause of our experiences. A detailed explanation of these is as follows:
(1) In the India of Mahavira's time, besides Jainism, Vedic and Buddhist religions were prominent, but their doctrines differed significantly on key issues. In the original Vedas, Upanishads, Smritis, and certain Vedantic schools of thought, there was a conception of God that led the common people to believe that God is the creator of the universe, and that He is the one who makes beings experience the fruits of good or bad actions. Since karma is inert, it cannot produce its fruits without the intervention of God. No matter how high a being may be, it cannot become God through its own development; a being is just a being, not God, and salvation from the world is not possible without God's grace, etc. _There were three errors in this kind of belief: (1) The intervention of a self-sufficient God in creation without any purpose. (2) The suppression of self-autonomy. (3) Ignorance of the power of karma. To rectify these errors and to reveal the true state of affairs, Lord Mahavira propounded the doctrine of karma.
Although Buddhism denied the role of God, Buddha's main objective was to stop violence and spread compassion, and his style of presenting the truth was also in line with his immediate objective. The Tathagata Buddha believed in karma and its consequences, but his doctrine propounded momentary nihilism. Therefore, another objective of Lord Mahavira's propounding the doctrine of karma was that if the soul is considered to be momentary, then there can be no explanation for the consequences of karma.

Page #45:
---------------------------
The experience of karma and the absence of the experience of parakrita karma can only occur when the soul is neither considered eternally solitary nor momentarily solitary.

Materialists were the same then as they are today. They did not believe in the permanent work of the rebirth garden of the karma-experiencer after the destruction of the physical body: this view was very narrow, which was refuted by the theory of karma.

Karma theory-thought: In the public discourse, the consideration of the element of karma has been considered timeless. Jains have supported it in the same way that Mimamsakas support the belief in the timelessness of the Vedas. Both types of devotees, those who use intellect and those who do not, have believed in it, and those who use intellect do not just accept it out of faith, but also support it as much as possible through intellect. From this perspective, the examination of karma theory is important, but it is equally important to consider it from a historical perspective.

From a historical perspective, the first proposition in the chain of tradition related to the thought of karma is whether or not to believe in the theory of karma, and if so, on what basis. There was one side that did not believe in any other goal of life than kama and its means, artha. In their view, the material world is the only goal of life. Therefore, they were not obliged to believe in any theory of karma that would lead to good or bad births or the afterlife. This side was known as the Charvakas. But in that ancient age, there were also thinkers who said that there is rebirth after death. Not only that, there are also other superior and inferior worlds besides this visible world. They were called rebirthists and afterlife believers, and they accepted the theory of karma as the cause of rebirth and the afterlife. Their view was that if there is no karma, then the relationship between birth after birth and this world and the afterlife cannot occur. Therefore, it is necessary to accept the theory of karma on the basis of the belief in rebirth. These karma believers called themselves afterlife believers and theists.

Page #46:
---------------------------
There have been two main factions among these Karmavadi. One faction propounded that the fruits of Karma are inevitable in this life, in future lives and in the afterlife, but for a superior birth and a desirable afterlife, Karma must also be superior. This faction, being a believer in the afterlife and considering heaven as the superior realm and advocating Dharma as the means to attain it, accepted only three Purusharthas: Dharma, Artha, and Kama. It did not have a separate place for Moksha.

Wherever the term "Pravartak Dharma" is mentioned, it is indicative of the mindset of this Tripurushartha faction. This faction was a supporter of the social order, therefore, it indicated a kind of social order by explaining the origin of Dharma in socially acceptable, refined, and inherent conduct and the origin of Adharma from inappropriate conduct. This faction became known as Brahmanmarg, Mimamsak, and Karmakandi. Its meaning in brief is:

Dharma - the fruit of good deeds is heaven and Adharma - the fruit of bad deeds is hell, etc. Dharma and Adharma are called punya-papa and adrishta, and through them, the cycle of birth and death continues, which cannot be eradicated. If it is possible, then it is only possible if one wants to attain a good realm and more happiness, then Dharma is the duty. According to this view, Adharma or sin is to be avoided, but Dharma or virtue is not to be avoided.

The second faction of Karmavadi held a completely opposite view to the above faction. It believed that Karma is indeed the cause of rebirth. The practice of refined, acceptable, and prescribed actions gives rise to Dharma and also leads to heaven, but that Dharma is also completely avoidable, just like Adharma. According to this view, there is a fourth Purushartha, which is called Moksha. It states that Moksha alone is the goal of life and for Moksha, all Karma, whether it be in the form of virtue or sin, is avoidable. It is not that Karma cannot be eradicated. It is also possible with effort.

Wherever the term "Nivartaka Dharma" is mentioned, it is indicative of this view.

Page #47:
---------------------------
This is a hint. According to this view, when ultimate karma-nivṛtti is desired, it had to be explained as the real cause of the origin of karma against the view of the first group. It said that the root cause of dharma and adharma is not the prevailing social laws and prohibitions, but ignorance and raga-dvesha. Even if the conduct is refined, accepted and prescribed by society, if it is based on ignorance and raga-dvesha, then it gives rise to adharma. The distinction between punya and papa is for those who have a gross vision. In reality, since punya and papa are all based on ignorance and raga-dvesha, they are both adharma and despicable. This nivṛttakadharma group was not social but individualistic. When it accepted the annihilation of karma and moksha as the purpose of life, it had to consider the causes that annihilate karma and generate moksha. As a result of this consideration, the causes that it established as karma-nivṛttak are the nivṛttakadharma of this group.

The direction of pravṛttakadharma and nivṛttakadharma are completely opposite to each other. The aim of one is to protect the social order and create good order, while the aim of the other is to achieve personal inner happiness, therefore it is only self-oriented. Nivṛttakadharma is known by names like śramaṇa, parivājaka, tapasvī and yogamārga etc. Since karma-pravṛtti is born of ignorance and raga-dvesha, the means of its ultimate cessation was established as samyak-jñāna, which is opposed to ignorance, and samyama, which is in the form of raga-dvesha-nāśa, which is opposed to raga-dvesha. The rest of the means, such as tapas, dhyāna, bhakti etc., were considered as means of the said knowledge and samyama.

There were many factions among the followers of nivṛttakadharma. This factionalism was partly due to the aggressive nature of the arguments and partly due to the different processes of epistemology. Three factions seem to be known: (1) Paramāṇunādī, (2) Pradhānavādī, (3) Paramāṇu but with the shadow of Pradhāna. Of these, the first, the Paramāṇuvādī, although supporting moksha, was not as opposed to pravṛttakadharma as the latter two. This faction became known as Nyāya, Vaiśeṣika darśana. The second faction, the Pradhānavādī, being a supporter of ultimate karma-nivṛtti, also considered pravṛttakarma, i.e. śrauta-smārta karma, to be despicable.

---------------------------
(48) This side is known as Sankhya-Yoga and it is on the basis of its philosophy and under the shadow of its renunciation that the Vedanta philosophy and the path of renunciation were established. The third side was the main shadow, i.e., the opposite of the promoter dharma, the ultimate, like the peacock's tail. This side is known as Jain and Nirgnyadarshan. Buddhism is the ultimate opponent of promoter dharma, but it is a later independent development of a mixture of the second and third sides. But the common goal of all renunciants is to destroy the root of karma in some way and to attain a state where they do not have to return to the cycle of birth again.

It does not seem that promoter dharma was ever prevalent alone, and renunciation emerged later. Yet, there was certainly a time in the beginning when the establishment of promoter dharma was the main thing in society and renunciation was limited to individuals, so it was not only neglected by the promoters of dharma, but also faced the brunt of their opposition. But the distinct traditions of renunciants gradually developed inner elements like meditation, contemplation, austerity, yoga, devotion, etc. to such an extent that even in the presence of promoter dharma, the stamp of renunciation was imposed on society in a way, and everywhere there was talk of renunciation, and literature also began to be created and propagated with the ideas of renunciation.

Renunciants had to speculate about the nature of liberation and its means; but along with this, they also had to think a lot about the elements of karma. They established definitions and explanations of karma and its divisions, classified the elements of karma from the point of view of cause and effect, discussed the inherent powers of karma, considered the time limits of the consequences of each, and also considered the mutual relationships of karmas. In this way, renunciants developed a well-established science of karma.

Page #49:
---------------------------
It has been happening and in this, day by day, new questions and their answers have been leading to further development. 
These renunciate groups have been considering different aspects separately according to their own convenience, but as long as the combined objective of all of them was to refute the doctrine of the creator, there was exchange of ideas among them and there was also unanimity. This is the reason why in the literature on karma in Nyaya-Vaisheshika, Sankhya Yoga, Jain and Buddhist philosophies, there is a lot of similarity in terms of definition, meaning, classification, etc. While the existing literature of the said philosophies is mostly from the time when the harmony between the said philosophies had diminished considerably. 
There was already a problem before the liberationists that on the one hand, the old bound karmas are also infinite, on the other hand, new karmas are bound every moment at the time of experiencing their fruits in sequence, then how is the complete annihilation of all these karmas possible? The liberationists had also solved this problem very cleverly. Today we find the description of that solution in the literature of the said renunciate philosophies in brief or in detail. 
This situation is sufficient to indicate that there was a lot of exchange of ideas among the different groups of renunciates. Despite all this, the time had come when these renunciate groups were not as close as before. Nevertheless, each group continued to speculate about the element of karma. In the meantime, it also happened that a separate group of karma thinkers became stable in a renunciate group, who thought deeply about karma rather than questions related to liberation and mainly studied it, just as other groups of thinkers did in their own subjects and still do today.
All liberationists agree on the causes of bondage of karma and the means of its annihilation, but there is a difference in the views of the above-mentioned group of thinkers regarding the nature of the element of karma. Atomic liberationists

Vaisheshika and other schools considered karma to be an attribute of the soul (chetana), while the Pradhana-vada school of Samkhya Yoga considered it to be an attribute of the mind (antarahkarana), which is inert (jada). However, Jain thinkers, who consider both the soul and atoms to be products of karma, hold a unique view of karma as a result of both the soul and the inert. According to them, the soul, while being conscious, is also capable of contraction and expansion like the Prakriti (nature) of Samkhya, which allows for karmic modifications and can also become one with inert atoms. 

According to Vaisheshika and other schools, karma, being an attribute of the soul, is not truly separate from it. Similarly, according to Samkhya, karma, being an attribute of Prakriti, is not truly separate from the inert. However, Jain thinkers believe that karma is a result of both the soul and the inert, which they call "bhaava karma" (karma of consciousness) and "dravya karma" (karma of matter).

This entire process related to karma is undoubtedly very old, as there was a lot of exchange of ideas among thinkers of karma. While it cannot be said for sure how old this time was, the deep thought, systematic structure, and extraordinary presentation of subtle and extremely subtle concepts in the Jaina Karma Shastra, which has been a long-standing institution in Jain philosophy, makes it clear that Jain philosophy's unique karma-vidya (science of karma) must have been established before the time of Lord Parshvanatha. This very vidya is what made Jain thinkers known as Karma Shastrajnas, and this vidya was spread under the names "Agrayaniya-purva" and "Karma-pravada-purva".

Jain thinkers paid a lot of attention to the concept of karma, while Samkhya Yoga focused particularly on the path of meditation. Later, when the Tathagata Buddha appeared, he also emphasized meditation. However, all of them retained the form of karma-chintan that they inherited. This is why Jain Karma Shastra holds a unique place in terms of its subtlety and detail. Nevertheless, it shares a lot of similarities with the karma-chintan of Samkhya Yoga, Buddhism, and other schools, and there is also a fundamental unity, which is important for students of Karma Shastra to know.

## Jain Philosophy and the Doctrine of Karma

India is the sacred land of philosophical thought. Here, sages have pondered deeply on the profound questions of life.  They have contemplated and analyzed the nature of the soul, the Supreme Soul, the nature of karma, and the fruits of karma.  Indeed, this is the very backbone of philosophical thought.

The doctrine of karma holds a significant place in the spiritual Indian philosophical tradition.  In their quest to understand the causes of happiness, suffering, and the various complexities of worldly existence, Indian thinkers explored the doctrine of karma.  However, the well-organized and well-developed form of this doctrine found in Jain philosophy is not found in any other system in such a systematic manner.  Therefore, we present here the Jain perspective on the doctrine of karma.

**The Nature of Karma**

The actions that occur within this worldly being, who is bound by attachment and aversion, can be categorized into five forms:  Mithyatva (false belief), Aviriti (non-restraint), Pramada (carelessness), Kshaya (passions), and Yoga (attachment).  These actions lead to the association of a type of unconscious substance with the soul.  This substance, fueled by attachment and aversion, binds itself to the soul.  In time, this substance bears fruit in the form of happiness and suffering.  This is called karma.  In other words, the actions performed by a being due to Mithyatva, Aviriti, Pramada, Kshaya, etc., are called karma.

**(a)  **"Kīrai jīma he uhi jeṇam tto bhaṇṇāe kamnam."**  (He who speaks of karma is a true knower.)

**(b)  **"Vimaya kamāyai rangiyahan je anuyālagganti. Jīva paesa mohiyahana te jiṇ kamm bhaṇati."**  (He who is attached to the world, who is stained by the colors of the world, is bound by karma.  The soul who is freed from attachment is free from karma.)

- Karma Grantha, Part 1.1
- Paramātma Prakash, 162

Page #52:
---------------------------
(52) There are two types of karma - **bhavan karma** and **dravya karma**. **Bhavan karma** refers to the emotions of attachment and aversion in the soul, which attract the unconscious karmic matter towards the soul. **Dravya karma** refers to the unconscious karmic matter that binds to the soul.

The detailed explanation of **bhavan karma** and **dravya karma** is found in the Jain scriptures. The five causes of karmic bondage are: **mithyatva** (false belief), **avirati** (non-renunciation), **pramada** (carelessness), **kṣaya** (passions), and **yoga** (attachment). These five causes can be summarized into two: **kṣaya** and **yoga**. Further, **kṣaya** is the ultimate cause of karmic bondage.

While there are many other causes of karmic bondage, the Jain scriptures categorize them into two: **raga** (attachment) and **dvesha** (aversion). Every mental thought is either rooted in attachment or aversion. Experience shows that even if the outward behavior of ordinary beings appears different, their actions are either driven by attachment or aversion. These tendencies lead to various desires. Whether a being is aware of it or not, their subtle desires are fueled by attachment and aversion.

Just as a spider gets trapped in its own web, a soul, due to ignorance and delusion, creates a web of karma and gets entangled in it. Ignorance, false knowledge, and other factors considered causes of karma are also connected to attachment and aversion. When attachment or aversion increases, knowledge gets distorted.

Despite the difference in terminology, the Jain view on the cause of karmic bondage does not contradict other orthodox philosophies. The Nyaya and Vaisheshika schools consider **mithyatva** (false knowledge) as the cause of karma. Yoga philosophy considers the non-differentiation of **prakriti** (nature) and **purusha** (soul) as the cause. Vedanta and other philosophies consider **avidya** (ignorance) as the cause. Jain philosophy considers **mithyatva** (false belief) as the cause of karmic bondage. However, it is important to remember that regardless of the terminology used, if the cause does not lead to karmic bondage, it cannot be considered the true cause of karma.

Page #53:
---------------------------
(53)
Bondage (the power to create karma) is only due to attachment and aversion. When attachment and aversion are absent, ignorance (mithyatva) diminishes or is destroyed. In the Mahabharata Shantiparva, the statement "karma binds the creature" also refers to attachment and aversion.
Thus, whether it is called mithyatva or attachment and aversion, all these are called bhavakarma.
Avyakarma - From the above statement, it is clear that karma bondage occurs due to physical and mental tendencies arising from attachment and aversion. Although every thought is a cause of karma acquisition, the karma bondage that occurs due to actions arising from kshaya is particularly strong, and the karma bondage that occurs due to actions with thought is weak and of short duration, and it takes less effort and less time to destroy it. Jain philosophy provides a well-organized description of the process of karma bondage. According to its belief, there are two types of substances in the world - (1) conscious and (2) unconscious. Unconscious substances are also of five types: dharma, adharma, space, time, and matter. Of these, the first four types of substances are intangible and formless. Therefore, they are beyond the reach of the senses and are therefore imperceptible. Only matter is a substance that is tangible and has form, and therefore it is visible to the senses and can be grasped and released. According to the etymology "puranadgalana pungala", to meet and to separate is its very nature. This matter has categories of perceptible and imperceptible forms. Among these are also karma particles. There is no place in the world where karma-producing matter particles are not present. When a being acts with its mind, speech, or body in any way, karma-producing matter particles are attracted from all sides, and as many regions as the soul exists in, so many matter particles are absorbed by it at that time. The number of particles varies according to the intensity of the action. The amount of action...

Page #54:
---------------------------
When there is an abundance of atoms, there is an increase in the number of atoms, and when there is a deficiency in the amount of tendency, there is a decrease in the number of atoms, and the binding of this group of assumed pudgala atoms with the soul through karma is called dvyakarma. There are four types of bonds:
These symbols are classified into four categories: prakritibandha, pradeshabandha, anubhagabandha, and sthitivedha.
From the four categories of yoga, shrir, kshaya, and parigati, prakritibandha and pradeshabandha are from yoga, and anubhagabandha and sthitibandha are from kshaya. In the absence of kshaya, karma cannot remain associated with the soul. Just as dust does not stick well to dry clothes and falls off upon touching, similarly, when there is no kshaya in the soul, even subtle atoms do not become associated and fall off upon touching.
The pulsating activity of the yogas of mind, speech, and body occurs every moment, but if they do not receive the support of kshayas, they cannot become active yogas for karmabandha. Therefore, the weak karmabandha that occurs from the necessary actions of walking, etc., that occur diligently is called 'asaparayika bandha', and the tendency of yoga that occurs due to kshayas is called 'saaparayika bandha'. Asaparayika bandha is not the cause of bhavanashaga, and it is through saaparayika bandha that the being wanders in the world.
**Discussion of Prakritibandha**
In the karma atoms associated with the soul, powers (sthabhatra) arise that cover the qualities of the soul, such as knowledge, etc.; this is called prakritibandha. The soul has infinite qualities. Therefore, the nature of the karmas that cover them will also be considered infinite, but all of them are summarized in the following eight karmas:
(1) Jnanavarana, (2) Darshanavarana, (3) Vedaniya, (4) Mohaniya,

Page #55:
---------------------------
(55)
The five (5) Darshanas, (6) Ayu, (7) Name, (6) Gotra, and (8) Antaray. Among these, Jnanavarana, Varana, Mohaniya, and Antaray - these four are called Ghatti (destructive) Prakṛtis, and the remaining Vedaniya, Ayu, Name, and Gotra - these four are called Aghati (non-destructive) Prakṛtis.

The Ghatti Prakṛtis destroy the four fundamental qualities (Jnan, Darshan, Veer, and Sukha Shakti) of the soul. Jnanavarana destroys the Jnanaguna of the soul, Darshanavarana destroys the Darshanaguna of the soul, Mohaniya is destructive for Sukha (Atmasukha), and Antaray destroys the Veer-Shakti of the soul. These four are called Ghatti Karma Prakṛtis because they cover and destroy the fundamental qualities of the soul.

Some of the Uttar-bhedas (sub-categories) of these four Ghatti Prakṛtis are partially destructive (Ekadesh Ghatti), hence they are called Desh-Ghatti, and some are completely destructive (Sarvansh Ghatti), hence they are called Sarva-Ghatti. But the Aghati Karma Prakṛtis do not destroy any quality of the soul. They provide the soul with a form that is not its own, but rather a collective, physical form. Vedaniya is the cause of favorable and unfavorable sensations, i.e., Sukha (pleasure) and Duhkha (pain). Ayu causes the soul to obtain various births in Naraka (hell) and other realms. Name gives the being various births, species, bodies, etc. and Gotra is the cause of the high and low status of beings.

The total number of Uttar-Prakṛtis of the above-mentioned Ghatti and Aghati Prakṛtis, including Jnanavarana, etc., is 158, which are as follows:

(1) Jnanavaraniya Karma (2) Darshanavaraniya Karma
(3) Vedaniya Karma (4) Mohaniya Karma (5) Ayu Karma (6) Name Karma (7) Gotra Karma (8) Antaray Karma

The names and characteristics of the aforementioned 158 Prakṛtis are mentioned in this very text (Karmavipaka, the first Karmagrantha), therefore, they should be seen by the inquisitive people. 

**Description of Praveshabandha**

The collection of Karma-pradeshas, i.e., Karma-paramanus, that a Jiva accumulates through its actions like Kayika etc., is called Pradeshabandha. These Pradeshas are associated with the soul, being divided into various types of Karmas. Among them, Ayakarma gets the least share, and Namakarma gets a slightly larger share than Ayukarma. Gotrakarma's share is equal to Namakarma!  Slightly more share is received by Jnanavaraniya, Darshanavaraniya, and Antaraya Karmas. The share of these three remains equal.  Mohaniya Karma receives an even larger share, and the largest share is received by Vedaniya Karma. These Pradeshas are further divided into Uttaraprakṛtis. This is the basis for the more or less share of each type of bound Karma.

**Description of Sthitibandha**

The different durations (time spent in Udya) of the maximum and minimum time of the eight Karmas, Jnanavaraniya etc., are described in the Karma literature as follows...

| Karma-Name | Maximum Time | Minimum Time |
|---|---|---|
| (1) Jnanavaraniya | 30 Koṭakoṭi Sagaropama | Antamuhurta |
| (2) Darshanavaraniya | 12 Muhurta | Antamuhurta |
| (3) Vedaniya | 70 Koṭakoṭi Sagaropama | 33 Sagaropama |
| (4) Mohaniya | 20 Koṭakoṭi Sagaropama | + Muhurta |
| (5) Ayu | 8 Muhurta | Antamuhurta |
| (6) Nama |  |  |
| (7) Gotra |  |  |
| (8) Antaraya |  |  |

To understand the nature of the various divisions of time, such as Sagaropama Adi, one should study the scriptures like Anuyogadwar and other Sutras. This will provide knowledge about Jain beliefs regarding the calculation of time.
**Explanation**
The intensity and slowness of the karmic results are based on the intensity and slowness of the causative passions (Kashaya). The more intense the passions of a being, the stronger will be his sinful actions (Ashubha Karma) and the weaker will be his virtuous actions (Shubha Karma). Conversely, the more free a being is from the intensity of passions and the purer his results, the stronger will be his virtuous actions and the weaker will be his sinful actions.
This is the perspective of Jain Karma Shastra regarding the intensity and slowness of karmic results.
**Various Stages of Karma**
The various stages of karma are described in Janakarma Shastra. These are related to the binding, arising, transformation, existence, decay, etc., of karma. These are broadly classified into the following categories:
(1) Bandhana (Binding), (2) Satya (Existence), (3) Udaya (Arising), (4) Udirana (Stimulation), (5) Uvartana (Rotation), (6) Apavartana (Reversal), (7) Sankraman (Transition), (8) Upshaman (Sublimation), (9) Nivatti (Cessation), (10) Nikanchan (Annihilation), and (11) Abada (Unhindered).
(1) Bandhana (Binding) - The binding of karma particles with the soul, i.e., becoming one like milk and water, is called Bandhana. Binding is of four types: Prakriti Bandha, Sthiti Bandha, Anubhag Bandha, and Pradesh Bandha. These have been described earlier.
(2) Satya (Existence) - The karma particles remain connected to the soul until their exhaustion (Kshaya). This state is called Satya. In this state, karma remains present even though it does not yield its results.
(3) Udaya (Arising) - The state of karma yielding its results is called Udaya.

(18)
Karmic particles that arise give their fruits according to their own nature and then are destroyed.
(4) Jayorana - The arising of karma before its appointed time is called udirana. Just as fruits can be ripened before their appointed time by effort, so too can bound karmas be experienced before their appointed time by effort. Generally, the udirana of a karma of the same type as the one whose arising is ongoing is possible.
(5) Uvartana - An increase in the state and section of bound karmas due to a particular feeling, a particular determination, is called udvartana. This is also called anga.
(6) Apavartana - This state is the exact opposite of udvartana. The reduction of the state and section of bound karmas due to a particular determination is called apavartana. Its other name is apakarshana.
The acceptance of both udvartana and apavartana proves that the intensity of the state and fruit of a karma can also change due to a particular determination.
(7) Sankraman - The transformation or change of the state, etc., of one type of karma-particles into the state, etc., of another type of particle is called sankraman.
This sankraman occurs only within the sub-natures of a single root nature, not between different root natures. Sankraman is considered to occur only in homogeneous natures, not in heterogeneous natures. There are some exceptions even in the sankraman of homogeneous natures, such as the four ayus of ayukarma, which do not inter-sankraman, nor do darshan mohaniya and charitra mohaniya.
(8) Upashaman - The state of karma in which arising, udirana, nirdhati, and nikachana are not possible is called upashaman.

Page #59:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**Karma in the state of suppression (Upaśamana) begins to function as soon as that state ends, meaning it arises (Udaya) and starts to bear fruit.**

**(9) The state of complete absence of Niśi-karma, Udarana, and Sankraman is called Nirdhāta. In this state, there is a possibility of Udvartana and Apavartana.**

**(10) Nikācana - This state means that karma, in the form in which it is bound, must be experienced in the same form. This state can also be called Niyati. Some karmas have this state.**

**(13) Abādha - The state of karma not yielding any fruit for a certain time after being bound is called Abādha. It is a part of Sattā. However, there is a difference between Abādha and Sattā. The state from binding to complete exhaustion is called Sattā, but Abādha is a state of Sattā in which the bound karma remains in its original form. This is the state before Udaya. The time period of this state is called Abādha Kāla.**

**Other philosophical traditions use different terms for Udaya, Sattā, Bandhana, Nikācana, Sankraman, and Upaśamana, such as Prārabdha, Sancita, Kriyamāṇa, Nigala Vipāki, Āvagamana, and Tanu respectively.**

**Bandha, Upay-Udirana, and Sattā are explained in terms of the eight karmas and their 158 Uttaraprakṛitis. Jain karma-shastra texts provide detailed descriptions of how many prakṛitis are involved in each of these states. According to these texts, Bandha has 120, Udaya and Udirana have 122, and Sattā has 158 prakṛitis.**

**The explanation of the above statement is that Sattā has all 158 prakṛitis, while Udaya and Udirana do not count the 20 prakṛitis of the 15 Bandhana and 5 Sanghatana Nāmakarma separately. However, their Audārika, etc...**

Page #60:
---------------------------
(60)
These five bodies are included in the five karmas called **nama karma**.  The four **pinda prakritis** - color, smell, taste, and touch - are counted as only four **prakritis** instead of twenty **uttar prakritis**.  Therefore, out of the total 158 **prakritis**, 36 **prakritis** of **nama karma** (20 and 16) are reduced, leaving 122 **prakritis** that are involved in **udaya** and **udirana**.  The reason for considering 120 **prakritis** in the **bandhavasta** is that out of the 122 **prakritis** that are capable of **udaya** and **udirana**, only **mithyatva mohaniya** is bound, not **samyaktva mohaniya** and **misra mohaniya** separately, because **samyaktva mohaniya** and **misra** (**samyaktva - mithyatva**) **mohaniya** are just specialized states of **mithyatva mohaniya**.  Therefore, when these two **prakritis** are reduced from the above 122 **prakritis** of **udaya** and **udirana**, there are 120 **prakritis** that remain in the **bandhavasta**.  The following table clearly shows the number of **prakritis** that exist in the states of **satta** etc.

Karma Name | Bandha | Udaya Udirana | Satta | Karmakshaya Process
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
Jnanavaraneya Karma | 5 | 26 | 2 |  | 
Darshanavaraneya Karma | 2 | 4 | 4 |  | 
Vedaniya Karma | 28 | 67 | 103 |  | 
Mohaniya Karma | 4 | 67 |  |  | 
Ayukarma |  |  |  |  | 
Nama Karma |  |  |  |  | 
Gotra Karma |  |  |  |  | 
Antaraya Karma |  |  |  |  | 

Through **yoga** and **kṣaya**, a worldly being continuously binds karma, just as the process of karma destruction also continues.

Page #61:
---------------------------
(61) Some karmas do not bear fruit immediately, they remain dormant for some time. This fruitless state is called **Abadha Kala**. After the **Abadha Kala** passes, the bound karma starts to bear fruit, which is called **Uday**. Each karma comes into **Uday** for a period of time according to its bound state and then detaches from the soul after bearing fruit, which is called **Nirjara**. This means that the time of **Karma-Nirjara** is equal to the time of the karma's state. When all karmas are detached from the soul, the being becomes completely free from karma and resides in its true nature of **Sat-Chit-Ananda-Ghan**. This is called **Moksha**.

The cycle of binding and experiencing the fruits of karma continues for the worldly beings. All worldly beings are holders of some **Gati** (state of existence) among the **Naraka** (hell) and other **Paragati** (transmigration). The classification of how many senses they have, what kind of body they have, and what kind of **Yoga** (spiritual practices) they have is done in **Jan-Karma Shastra** through **Margna** (categories). There are fourteen types of **Margna**:

**Gati**, **Indriya**, **Sharira**, **Yoga**, **Ved**, **Kashaya**, **Jnana**, **Samyama**, **Darshan**, **Leshya**, **Bhavya**, **Samyaktva**, **Sanji**, **Aharak**.

By adding the word **Margna** to each of these, we get the full name, such as **Gati Margna**, **Indriya Margna**, etc.

Through these **Margna**, a complete classification of all worldly beings' external conditions like body, etc., and internal qualities like knowledge and power, etc., is achieved. For example, if a being is in the **Naraka Gati**, we can know what kind of body it will have, how many senses it will have, and what its capacity for **Shan**, **Darshan**, **Samyaktva**, etc., will be in this bound state.

Based on these external and internal conditions, each being binds what kind of karmas, and how they gradually detach from the soul, leading to what level of purity in the soul, and what kind of qualities and states are achieved as a result of this purity, is described in **Karma Shastra** through **Gunasthanas** (stages of purification). These **Gunasthanas** are also fourteen in number, like the **Margna**, and their names are as follows:

Page #62:
---------------------------
Mithyatva, Sasvadan, Mitra (Samyam-Mithyasthi), Aviraat Samyagdristi, Deshaviraat, Amattasanyata, Aprammatasanvat, Nivritti (Apuurva Karan), Anivrittabadar Samparaya, Sukshma Samparaya, Upashant Kashaya-Chhamastha, Ksheenakashayaveetaraag-Chhadamastha, Sayogi-Keshi, Ayogi-Kevali. Adding the word Gunasthan to each of these creates their full name. For example, Mithyatva Gunasthan, Sasvadan Gunasthan, etc. These Gunasthanas are the stages of purity and impurity of the soul's knowledge, perception, and conduct. Mithyatva Gunasthan is the most impure state and Ayogi-Kevali Gunasthan is the purest state. As a worldly soul progresses from impurity to purity, it sheds its karmas and becomes purer. As purity increases, karma-shedding increases and karma-binding decreases. With less binding and more shedding, a time comes when the worldly soul sheds all its karmas and attains liberation, becoming free from the cycle of birth and death forever.

Thus, in Jain Karma Shastra, the classification of all worldly souls is done through Marganas and the stages of gradual purification are explained through Gunasthanas, culminating in the depiction of the state of complete purity.

Now, let's consider the means by which a karma-bound soul can manifest its true nature.

Jain philosophy states that there are three means to attain the ultimate goal of liberation (Moksha): (1) Samyagdarshan, (2) Samyagjnana, and (3) Samyakcharitra. In some places, only knowledge and action are mentioned as the means to liberation. In such cases, it should be understood that Darshan is considered to be the essence of knowledge and is not separate from it.

In this context, a question arises: Vedic philosophies consider karma, knowledge, yoga, and devotion as the four means to liberation. Why does Jain philosophy mention only three or two means? The answer is that the Samyakcharitra mentioned in Jain philosophy encompasses both karma and yoga.

Page #63:
---------------------------
Right Conduct (Samyakcharitra) encompasses the control of the mind (Manonigraha), the conquest of the senses (Indriyay), the purification of the mind (Chittashuddhi), equanimity (Samabhava), and the means to achieve these. The control of the mind, the conquest of the senses, etc., are the activities of the Karma Path (Karmamarg), while the purification of the mind and the virtuous tendencies leading to it are the activities of the Yoga Path (Yogmarg). Thus, the combination of the Karma Path and the Yoga Path constitutes Right Conduct.

Right Faith (Samyakdarshan) is the path of devotion (Bhaktimarg) because devotion primarily involves faith (Shraddha), and Right Faith is also in the form of faith. Right Knowledge (Samyakgyan) is the path of wisdom (Shanmarg). Thus, the three means of liberation (Moksha) described in Jainism - Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct - are the collective sum of all the means of other philosophies.

The essence of the discussion on karma in Jainism is that every karma is considered to have three states: binding (Badyaman), existing (Sat), and ripening (Udayaman). These are called bondage (Bandha), existence (Satta), and ripening (Uday) respectively. Other philosophers have also described these three states with different names. In Jain scriptures, karma is classified into eight and one hundred and eighty-one categories, such as the knowledge-obscuring (Gyanabaraneya), and the way these categories reveal the different states of the embodied soul is not found in any other philosophy. In Patanjali's philosophy, karma is described as having three types of results: birth (Jati), lifespan (Ayu), and enjoyment (Bhog). However, this description is merely nominal compared to the elaborate discussion of karma in Jainism.

How does karma bind with the soul? What are the reasons for this binding? What causes karma to develop its power? How long can karma remain attached to the soul, both at its maximum and minimum duration? How long can karma remain attached to the soul without producing its results? Can the fixed time of ripening be changed? If so, what kind of self-transformations (Atma-parinam) are necessary? When can one karma become another karma? How can the three subtle powers of karma during its binding phase be changed? When and how can karma that is about to ripen be experienced earlier? How can even the most powerful karma be prevented from ripening by pure spiritual transformations? Sometimes, the soul...

Page #64:
---------------------------
(64)
Why does the result of karma not cease without being experienced even after trying? How is the soul the doer of karma and how is it the experiencer? Even though this is the case, how is there actually no doership and experience of karma in the soul? How do the results in the form of afflictions create a subtle layer of dust on the soul through their power of attraction? How does the soul, through the manifestation of its inherent power, lift and throw away this subtle layer of dust? How does the naturally pure soul appear to be stained by the influence of karma? How does the soul not deviate from its pure form even though there are thousands of external influences? How does it remove even the intense karmas of the past at the time of its liberation? What kind of barrier exists between the soul and the karmas that are obstacles when it is eager to see its present state of being the Supreme Soul? Finally, how does the powerful soul weaken the powerful karmas through its results and make its path of progress free from obstacles? What is the nature of the results called 'Apuurvakaran' and 'Anivrittikaran' that help in experiencing the Supreme Soul in the temple of the soul? How does the soul, with its pure wave-like results, crush the mountains of karma with its electrical machine? How do karmas, which are suppressed for a while after being swallowed, sometimes throw the progressive soul down? Which karmas are opposed to each other in terms of their binding and arising? In which state is the binding of which karma inevitable and in which state is it uncertain? In which state is the result of which karma fixed and in which state is it uncertain? How does the subtle karma associated with the soul attract subtle particles through its power of attraction and create the body, mind, subtle body, etc. through them? And so on, countless questions related to karma. Their logical and detailed description cannot be found in the literature of any other philosophy except Jain karma literature. This is the special feature of Jainism regarding the principle of karma. The place of karma in Indian philosophical literature. Jainism, propounded by the Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira Tirthankara, is a philosophy of Syadvada,

Page #65:
---------------------------
Ahiṃsābāda, Ādi, etc., are its important limbs. In the same way, and to the same extent, Karmavāda is also its principal limb. Just as Janadarśana has marked a perspective in world literature in the explanation and description of Syādvāda and Ahiṃsābāda, in the same way, it has also displayed the same skill and glory in the exposition of Karmavāda. This is the reason why the research and explanation of Karmavāda done by Janadarśana has gained a very important place in Indian philosophical literature, like its Anekantavāda, Ahiṃsābāda, etc.

The place of Karmavāda in Janadarśana is generally believed that Jain philosophy is Karmavādi. Although this belief is not false, yet under the cover of this belief, an illusion has arisen that Janadarśana is only Karmavādi. In this regard, it should be said that Jain philosophy is not only Karmavādi, but according to the statement of Ācārya Siddhasena Divākara, it is a philosophy that believes in five causal theories, namely Kālatraya, Svabhāvādi, etc. Karmavāda is one of the aforementioned causal theories. Nevertheless, the main reason for the emergence of the aforementioned illusory belief is that out of the five aforementioned theories accepted by Jain philosophy, Karmavāda has occupied so much space in the literary field that no other theory has occupied even a hundredth of the space that it has occupied.

There is no such Āgama in the original Jain Karma literature, which is only subject-oriented to Karmavāda, and the nature of Jain Karmavāda and its explanation are separately indicated in the Jain Āgamas available today, so it cannot become a limb in the publication of the importance of Jain Karmavāda. Therefore, in this situation, this curiosity is natural and should be:

Page #66:
---------------------------
What is the source of the exposition of Karmavada, an integral part of Jain philosophy? The answer of the interpreters and proponents of Jain Karmavada literature is that the fundamental, detailed, and comprehensive exposition of the subject matter of Jain Karmavada is found in the Maha Shastra called Karma Pravada Purva. Our exposition of Karmavada, other compositions, etc., are based on this Maha Shastra. Although this original Maha Shastra has been lost to oblivion and vanished due to the passage of time, the Karmavada literature available to us today is a shadow of the original Maha Shastra. Due to the oblivion and absence of the aforementioned Maha Shastra, the creators of Karma literature had to leave out the exposition of many things in Karmavada, and many descriptions that appear contradictory have been left to the mercy of fate.

**Proponents of Jain Karma Literature**

The proponents of Jain Karma Siddhanta literature are divided into two traditions: Shwetambar and Digambar. However, the exposition and description of Karmavada have remained the same. This is why both traditions are considered to have the same theoretical framework in every subject. Both traditions are also on the same level in terms of the characteristics of this literature. In addition, there may be ease or difficulty, brevity or detail in the composition and description of the subject matter depending on the abilities of the authors. However, from a realistic perspective, the Karmavada literature of neither tradition can be considered less glorious. As is the case with every subject, both traditions have borrowed, described, and compared each other's material in Karmavada literature. This proves that neither tradition is less glorious in Karmavada literature. There have been many learned Acharyas in both traditions who are experts in Karmavada, and their statements are never flawed. Powerful texts like Karma Prakriti, Pancha Sangraha, etc.,

Page #67:

Both sects are at the same level in terms of their subject matter and nomenclature.
In the Svetambara sect, Acharya Shivsharm Suri, Churnikar Acharya Shri Chandri Mahत्तर, Shri Gargarshi, Navangivrittikar Acharya Shri Abhaydev Suri, Shri Muni Suri Malladhari Shri Hemchandracharya Shri Chakreswaramuri, Shri Dhaneshwaracharya, Kharatar, Gachchiya Acharya Shri Jinvallabh Suri Acharya Malayagiri, Shri Yashodev Suri Shri Paramanand Suri, Brihadgachchiya Shri Haribhadra Suri, Shri Ramdev, Tapa Gachchiya Acharya Shri Devendra Suri Shri Udayaprabha, Shri Gunaratna Suri Shri Munishekhara Agamic Shri Jayatilak Suri Nyayavisharad Nyayacharya Mahamahaopadhyay Shri Yashvijayji, etc. have become many original and explanatory Karmavad-related literature. Proponents and interpreters, expert Acharyas and Sthaviras.

The great Acharya Shri Siddharsi's Upbhitibhavprapancha Katha, Malladhari Hemchandra Suri's Bhavana Mantri Yashpal's Mohiraj Parajay Natak, Mahamahaopadhyay Yashovijayji's Vairagiya Kalpalata, etc. are presenting the Karma Siddhanta of Janadarshan with utmost precision. The works are adorning a unique place in Indian literature, which is glorious for the Karma Siddhanta of Jain Darshan. Similarly, in the Digambara sect, Shri Pushpadanta Acharya, Shri Bhootbali Acharya, Shri Gunadhara Acharya, Shri Yativrishabha Acharya, Shri Virasena Acharya, Shri Nemichandra Siddhantachkravarti, etc. have been prominent interpreters of Karmavatra-related literature, proficient Acharyas and Sthaviras.

Scholars from both sects have made similar efforts to record Karmavad-related literature in Prakrit, Magadhi, Sanskrit and vernacular languages. Svetambara Acharyas have created Karmaprakriti, Panchasangrah, ancient and modern Karmagranthas and their Churni, Bhashya, Tika, Avchurni, Tippani, Tabba, etc. in various forms of Karma literature, while Digambara Acharyas have created Mahakramam Prakriti Prabhrit, Kashaya Prabhrit, Gommatasar, Labdhisar, Kshapanasar, Panchasangrah, etc. and their commentaries in Magadhi, Sanskrit, etc. languages.

---------------------------
This is a composition of **kamasahitya**. While the literature related to **karmavada** from both traditions has many characteristics, it is like saying that the owner of another sect is **taran durjay sharda ma kosa** - deprived of the unique brilliance of **karmavada**. In short, both sects have made a significant contribution to strengthening the **karmavada** accepted by Jain philosophy.

The concept of **karma** is found in Vedic and Buddhist literature, but it is so limited that no specific text on it is found in that literature. However, in Jain philosophy, the concept of **karma** is subtle, systematic, and very detailed. Therefore, the scripture that expounds these ideas, which is called **karma shastra** or **karma-related literature**, has occupied a large part of the **janasahitya**. **Karma sahitya** should be called the heart of Jain literature. Although some discussion of **karma** is found in other Jain texts, there are also many independent texts on it.

Lord Mahavira preached **karmavada**, and its tradition continues to this day. However, there have been some changes in it due to sectarian differences, compilation, and language.

(1) **Sectarian Differences:** Lord Mahavira's teachings were divided into two branches: **Svetambara** and **Digambara**. At that time, **karma shastra** also became divided. The foundation of sectarian differences was laid in such a way that scholars from both sects never got the opportunity to discuss the **karma tattva** preached by Lord Mahavira together. As a result, in the original subject:

1. To get a special introduction to **Svetambara-Digambara karmavada** literature, see the preface of '**Sastikrashnatwar Prachin Karmaprantha:**' published by Shri Atmanand Jain Sabha Bhavnagar and edited by Shri Narvijayji Maharaj.

Page #69:
---------------------------
Although there are no major differences, there are some minor variations in terminology, their explanations, and sometimes in their implications, which are still prevalent today. We will present these points of difference in their respective places.

(2) Compilation - From the time of Lord Mahavira till now, the compilation of Karma Shastra has been ongoing, which can be broadly divided into three parts: (a) Purvatmak Karma Shastra, (b) Karma Shastra derived from the Purvas (Aakar Roop Karmashalya), and (c) Prakaranik Karma Shastra.

(a) Purvatmak Karma Shastra - This part is the largest and the first, it is the foundation of all knowledge, until the Purva Vidya was not discontinued. After Lord Mahavira, for about nine hundred or a thousand years, the Purva Vidya remained in a declining state. The eighth of the fourteen Purvas, called Karma Pravad, was mainly about Karma, but in addition to this, the other Purva, 'Agravaniya', also had a part called Karma-Prabhut, which explained the subtle principles. At this time, the original part of Purvatmak Karma Shastra is not present in the Svetambar or Digambar literature.

(b) Karma Shastra derived from the Purvas (Aakar Roop) - This part is much smaller than the first part, but it is so large for the present practitioners that it has to be called Aakar Karma Shastra. This part is directly derived from the Purvas, this mention is found in the texts of both Svetambar and Digambar. The part of Karma Shastra derived from the Purvas is still present in both sects. Due to the establishment of sectarian differences at the time of borrowing, the derived part is known by different names in both sects. In the Svetambar sect - (1) Karma Prakriti, (2) Shatak, (3) Panchasangrah and (4) Saptatika - these four texts and in the Digambar sect - (1) Maha Karma-Prakriti Prabhut and (2) Kashaya Prabhut - these two texts are considered to be derived from the Purvas.

(c) Prakaranik Karma Shastra - This part is the result of the third compilation. It includes many small and large chapters on Karma. These chapters...

Page #70:
---------------------------
The study of scriptures is particularly prevalent at this time. After reading these case-specific scriptures, the intelligent practitioner reads the Ākara scriptures. To enter the Ākara scriptures, it is necessary to first study the Prākaranika division. This Prākaranika Karmaśāstra division flourished from the 12th-13th century to the 16th-17th century.

From a language perspective, Karmaśāstra can be divided into three parts: (a) Prākrit language, (b) Sanskrit language, and (c) prevalent regional language.

(a) Prākrit language - The early and previously established Karmaśāstra is written in the Prākrit language. A large part of the Prākaranika Karmaśāstra is also found written in the Prākrit language. In addition to the original texts, commentaries on them are also in the Prākrit language.

(b) Sanskrit language - The Karmaśāstra that was created in ancient times is all in the Prākrit language, but later Karmaśāstra was also composed in the Sanskrit language. Most of the Karmaśāstra in the Sanskrit language is in the form of commentaries and annotations. However, there are also some original Prākaranika Karmaśāstra texts in both traditions that are written in the Sanskrit language.

(c) Prevalent regional language - The prevalent regional languages mainly include Kannada, Gujarati, and Rajasthani Hindi. There are only a few original texts in these languages. These languages have been primarily used for translating original texts and commentaries. In particular, these regional languages are used for commentaries, annotations, and translations written on the Prākaranika Karmaśāstra division. The Digambara literature adopted Kannada and Hindi languages, while the Gujarati and Rajasthani languages were used in the Śvetāmbara literature.

{71} Introduction to the Karmafare Granth

The literature of the established religions in the world is divided into two parts - (1) Tattvajnan (2) Achar and Kriya. These two divisions are not completely separate from each other. Their relationship is like that of the eyes and hands and feet, etc., in the body. Jain literature is also divided into these two divisions of Tattvajnan and Achar. This Granth Karmavipak is related to the first division. Although Jain philosophy has considered many principles from various perspectives, this Granth does not describe all of them. It mainly describes the principle of Karma.

To gain a better understanding of this Granth, it is important to pay attention to its name, subject, description order, basis of composition, definition, and author, etc.

Name
---
This Granth has two names - 'Karmavipak' and 'Pratham Karmagranth'. The first name is appropriate to the subject and the author himself has clearly stated it in the beginning with 'Kappanika gamaso bucchham' and at the end with 'Ia kammatrivaago'ayam'. However, the second name is not mentioned anywhere. The second name has become popular only because it is the first among other Karma-related Granths like Karmastav, etc. Without reading this, one cannot enter the next chapters like Karmastav, etc. This name is so famous that readers, teachers, and other people generally use this name. Due to this popular name, the original name 'Karmavipak' has become almost unknown that many people do not understand the intention of the speaker when they say 'Karmavipak'. This is not only true for this chapter but also for the subsequent chapters like Karmastav, etc. For example, very few people will understand the meaning of the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth chapters when they are called Karmastav, Karmaswamitva, Shadshitka, Shatak, and Satna respectively. But everyone will understand the intention of the speaker when they are called the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth Karmagranth respectively.

Page #72:
---------------------------
**Subject:** The subject matter of this text is the Karma-Tattva, but it focuses only on the nature aspect, without considering many related matters. In other words, it primarily describes the results of all the natures of Karma. This is why it is named Karmavipak.

**Description:** The text begins by explaining that Karma-bandha is not natural but caused. To fully explain the nature of Karma, it is divided into four parts: (1) Nature, (2) State, (3) Rasa, and (4) Region. It then lists the eight fundamental natures and their sub-categories. 

To illustrate the nature of Jnanabaranīyakarma, the author first describes knowledge. The five types of knowledge and their sub-categories are briefly but accurately explained. After describing knowledge, the text clarifies the Karma that covers it. Then, Darshanabaranīyakarma is explained with examples. The text then describes its categories and defines the word "Darshan." Among the categories of Darshanabaranīyakarma, the five types of sleep are described in a concise and engaging manner, based on universal experience. 

Following this, the text describes the Vedaniya Karma that causes pleasure and pain, the Mohaniya Karma that hinders faith and good conduct, the Ayukarma that opposes eternal life, the Namakarma that generates various states like motion, the Gotrakarma that determines high and low birth, and the Antarayakarma that obstructs benefits. The text briefly but experientially describes the categories of each Karma. Finally, the text concludes by explaining the cause of each Karma.

Thus, the main subject of this text is the result of Karma. The content can be summarized into five parts:

(1) Description of the four parts of each Karma, including Nature, etc.
(2) The fundamental and sub-natures of Karma.
(3) Description of the five types of knowledge and four types of Darshan.
(4) Explanation of the function of all natures with examples.
(5) Explanation of the cause of all natures.

---------------------------
**Basis:** This work is a concise version of the *Karmavipak* by Bhaus. The *Karmavipak* is based on the *Agamas* such as the *Viganis*, *Anuyogadwar*, etc. The *Agamas* are the scriptures of Jainism. The *Karmavipak* is a commentary on the *Agamas* and presents the principles of karma in a concise and accessible way. The *Karmavipak* is also based on the ancient *Kamantripaph* by Garg Rishi, and other ancient texts such as *Pharm-prakriti* and *Panchasangrah*.

The ancient *Karmagranth* has 166 verses. It is very detailed and can be overwhelming for beginners. Therefore, this work is a concise version of the *Karmagranth* with only 61 verses. Despite its brevity, this work covers all the essential principles of karma.

The author has also included some new topics that are not found in the ancient *Karmavipak*. For example, the 20 synonyms of *Shush-gyan* and the 8 types of karma that bind the soul are not mentioned in the ancient *Karmavipak*, but are included in this work.

The author has also taken care to ensure that the work is easy to understand. For example, the author has not explained the consequences of each type of karma, as is done in the ancient *Karmavipak*. However, all the essential information has been included.

This work has been widely accepted and has made the study of karma accessible to everyone. Those who read this work can easily understand the ancient *Karmavipak* without needing any commentary. This work is also easy to memorize due to its concise nature.

**Language:** The original language of this *Karmagranth* and all other *Karmagranths* is Prakrit. The original verses are written in a simple language that can be understood by those who have a basic knowledge of Sanskrit and Prakrit. The commentary is written in Sanskrit and is very detailed, making it easy to understand.

The time period of the present author, Shri Devendrasuri, is the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th century Vikram Samvat. His passing is mentioned in the Gurvavali (verse 174) as Vikram Samvat 1337, but the time of his birth, initiation, and Murtipad is not mentioned anywhere. However, it seems that in 1225, Shri Jagachandrasur established the Tapa Gachchha, and he may have been initiated there. After the establishment of the Gachchha, Shri Jagachandrasur gave the Suri Gad to Shri Devendrasuri and Shri Vijayachandrasur, as mentioned in the Gurvavali (verse 107). It must be accepted that Shri Devendrasuri would have been a senior in age, knowledge, and restraint at the time of receiving the Suri Pad. Otherwise, how could he have handled the burden of such a heavy position, especially the leadership of the newly established Tapa Gachchha? His Suri Pad was received after Vikram Samvat 1285. If we assume the time of his Suri Pad to be Vikram Samvat 1300, then it can be said that he would have been newly initiated at the time of the establishment of the Tapa Gachchha. If we assume his total lifespan to be 50 or 52 years, then it is clear that he was born around Vikram Samvat 1275. In Vikram Samvat 1602, he initiated Biradval, the son of Shreshthivar Jinachandra, in Ujjaini, who later became known as Vidyānandasūri. At that time, Devendrasuri would have been around 25-27 years old. This further confirms the assumption of his birth around Vikram Samvat 1275. Even though the time of his birth, initiation, and Murtipad is not certain, there is no doubt that he was enhancing the glory of Bharatavarsha, especially Gujarat and Malwa, with his presence at the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th century Vikram Samvat.

Birthplace, Caste, etc. - There is no evidence of where Shri Devendrasuri was born, what caste he belonged to, or what family he came from. The Gurvavali mentions his life story, but it is very brief. It mentions events after he received the Suri Pad, but not other details. Therefore, based on it,

Page #75:
---------------------------
While there is mention of his life, it is incomplete. However, his travels in Gujarat and Maswa suggest that he may have been born in Gujarat or Malwa. Due to lack of resources, there is no room for speculation regarding his caste or parents.

Scholarship and Character: There is no doubt that Shri Devendrasuri was a profound scholar of Jain scriptures. His writings are proof of this. The Guruvali mentions that he was a master of the six philosophies, and this is why ministers like Mantreshwar Vastupal and other scholars used to attend his lectures. Scholarship and writing are two different things, and it is not necessary for a scholar to write. However, it is undeniable that Devendrasuri had a deep understanding of Jain Agamas. He accurately composed the Karmagranth, which is known as the Nadin Karmagranth. The commentary is so detailed and well-supported that after reading it, one's curiosity to see the ancient Karmagranth or its commentaries is somewhat satisfied. His numerous works written in Sanskrit and Prakrit clearly indicate that he was a brilliant scholar of both languages.

Shri Devendrasuri was not only a scholar but also a great devotee of Dharma. As proof of this, it is sufficient to say that he supported the revival of the activities that had become inactive during the time of Shri Jagachchandrasuri, which was achieved through great effort and selfless sacrifice. Guru Shri Devendrasuri had Guru Jagachchandrasuri, who had started the work of revival with the help of Devbhadra Upadhyay. In this work, he presented an ideal for others by showing his extraordinary spirit of sacrifice.

Family: There is no specific information about Shri Devendrasuri's disciple family. However, it is written that many monks were his followers. The Guruvali mentions two of his disciples, Shri Vidyānanda and Shri Dharmakiriti. These two were brothers. Vidyānanda is the name behind Suripadi,

Page #76:
---------------------------
They have created a grammar called Vidyānanda. Dharmakiriti Upādhyāya, who became famous as Dharmaghosa after taking the Mooripad, has also composed some Sandhis. Both these disciples were good scholars of other scriptures besides Janasastras. Evidence of this is found in the last verse of their Guru Shri Devendrasūri's Karmagrantha commentary. They have written that this commentary created by me has been scrutinized by both the scholars Shri Vidyānanda and Shri Dharmakiriti. Some of the works of Shri Devendrasūri are as follows: (1) Shraddhadinakritya Sutravrutti, (2) Accurate Five New Karmagranthas, (3) Siddha Panchasika Sutravrutti, (4) Dharmaratna Vrutti, (5) Sudarshan Charitra, (6) Chaityavandanādi Bhashyatraya, (7) Vandaruvrutti, (8) Siriusbaddaman prominent Stotra, (9) Siddhadandika and (10) Saramr Nidesha.

Many of these have been published by other Jain Dharma-propagating organizations like the Atmananda Sabha Bhavnagar, Devchand Lal 'Mai' Pustkodar Fund Murat.

The five great vows (Mahavratas) are:
1. **Ahimsa** (non-violence)
2. **Satya** (truthfulness)
3. **Asteya** (non-stealing)

**Karmavipak**
[First Karma Granth]  Bhangalacharan and Abhidhey:
I, Siri Veer, offer my salutations, and will briefly explain the Karmavivag.  I will speak of the actions that lead to the creation of karma. ||1||
**Gatharth** - Salutations to Shri Veer Jinendra.  I will briefly explain the text called 'Karmavipak'.  The actions performed by a living being due to reasons such as Mithyatva, and the karma-worthy pudgala dravya that is combined with its own regions due to these actions, is called karma.
**Vishesharth** -  It is customary for noble people to remember great and auspicious beings at the beginning of any task, to ensure a smooth and successful completion.  Therefore, the author has begun the text by offering salutations to Shri Veer Jinendradev with the words 'Siri Veer Jinam'.  The reason for offering salutations to Shri Veer Jinendradev is that he has completely destroyed all karma, and attained the pure, enlightened state of the self.
'Siri Yore Jinam' - This phrase indicates the name of Shri Veer Jinendradev, and also his qualities, such as...

Page #82:
---------------------------
## Karmavipaka

**Shri** means Lakshmi. It has two aspects - inner and outer. The inherent qualities of a Jiva, such as infinite knowledge, infinite vision, Magasuna, Amagadarya, etc., are called inner Lakshmi. And the eight great miracles - (1) Ashoka tree, (2) rain of celestial flowers, (3) divine sound, (4) fly whisk, (5) seat, (6) halo, (7) drum, (8) sunshade - are called outer Lakshmi.

When a Tirthankara attains Kevala Jnana and delivers sermons to awaken the aspiring souls, the gods and Indra create a Samavasarana adorned with these eight outer Lakshmi to express their devotion and joy.

**Veer** is derived from the root "**vi**" meaning "special" and "**ra**" meaning "to protect". It can be interpreted as "one who possesses special qualities like infinite knowledge and protects others by helping them attain these qualities". Or, "one who destroys karma through tapasya and shines with its power".

**Jin** is derived from the root "**ji**" meaning "to conquer". It refers to one who has conquered the passions like attachment, hatred, delusion, lust, anger, etc., and the material obstacles like knowledge-obscuring karma, etc., and attained self-realization. 

The eight great miracles are the hallmarks of the Jineshwara.

## First Karma Granth
### 3
Lord Shri Veer Jinendra Dev is endowed with all these qualities and attributes. Therefore, the author has paid homage to him at the beginning of the granth. Thus, indicating the meaning of the words of the auspicious invocation, now the subject of the granth is indicated.
### Definition of Karma
J
Whatever is done by the jiva through mithyatva, aviriti, pramada, kshaya and yoga is called karma, i.e., the subtle particles of karma, which are present in the infinite space, are attracted by the raag-dvesh-atmak action of the soul, like a magnet, and become attached to the soul's space, they are called karma.
Karma is pudgalik. That which has touch, taste, smell, and color is called pudgal. Earth, water, air, etc. are made of pudgal. The pudgal that becomes karma, i.e., transforms into the form of karma, is a kind of extremely subtle dust, i.e., dust, which the senses (even with the help of instruments) cannot know, but only the omniscient, the only knower, or the perfect clairvoyant knows it through his knowledge. When the pudgal capable of becoming karma is taken up by the jiva, it is called karma.
1. **Vishay kshayah rangiyahan je anuy lagati. Jiva-ame mohiyahante te jig kamma bhayanti.**
2. (a) **Roop-ras-gandh-varg-vantaha pudgalah.**
    - **Paramatma Prakash 162**
    - **Tattvarth Sutra A. 5 Sutra 23**
(b) **Poggale panchavane pancharase dugandhe atthaphse pannatte.**
    - **Vyakhya Prajnaptti S. 12, 05, S. 450**

Page #84:
---------------------------
##  **Low Karma**

Just as a person who applies oil to their body and then rolls in dust, the dust sticks to their entire body, in the same way, when there is a pulsation - movement - in the soul-regions of a being bound to the cycle of existence, due to false belief, lack of dispassion, carelessness, passions, and yoga, etc., then an infinite number of karmic particles become connected to the soul-regions. Just as a ball of iron heated by fire constantly draws water to itself, in the same way, a being bound to the cycle of existence, through the fickleness of their mind, speech, and body, due to the causes of karmic bondage like false belief, etc., constantly attracts and accumulates low karmic particles. And just as there is a relationship between milk, water, fire, and a ball of iron, so too is there a relationship between the being and these karmic particles.

The being possesses infinite qualities like knowledge, perception, subtle body, and energy. Karma, while covering these infinite qualities of the being, also becomes the cause of birth and death, and of being called high or low, and sustains the being in those states.

## **The Relationship Between the Being and Karma**

The relationship between the being and karma has existed since time immemorial. Just as the relationship between gold and the stone-like impurities in gold ore (kan-kopal) is timeless, so too is the relationship between the being and karma. The natural tendency of a being bound to the cycle of existence is to be transformed by attachment, etc., and the nature of bound karma is to cause the being to be transformed by attachment, etc.

Page #85:
---------------------------
## First Karma Granth

This nature of the soul and karma has been going on since the beginning of time. Therefore, the relationship between the soul and karma should be understood as being from the beginning of time. If the relationship between karma and the soul is considered to be from the beginning of time, then it leads to the fault that "even liberated souls should be bound by karma." 

The relationship between the soul and karma is from the beginning of time, but it is not the same as the beginning of time of the karma-lineage (flow). However, being from the beginning of time, it is both finite (with an end) and infinite (without an end). Those souls who have attained or will attain liberation have a finite relationship with karma from the beginning of time, and those who will never attain liberation have an infinite relationship with karma from the beginning of time.

Among the souls bound by karma, those who have the potential to attain liberation are called *bhavya*, and those who do not have this potential are called *abhavya*.

Although there is one type of karma in general, there are two types of karma in particular, based on the difference between substance and quality. Among them, the form of knowledge-obscuration, etc., is called *dravya karma*, which is the aggregate of *pudgala* atoms, and the qualities of ignorance, etc., and the emotions of anger, etc., which arise from their power, are called *bhava karma*.

Due to the influence of *kṣaya*, the soul attracts *pudgala* particles that are fit for karma, but to explain this specifically: (1) *mithyatva*, (2) *avirati*, (3) *pramada*, (4) *krodha*, and (5) *yoga*, these five are...

1. (a) The relationship between the two, like gold, copper, and fire. (b) This soul is bound by karma from the beginning of time, because it is the object of desire.
- Lokaprakash, 424

2. The aggregate of *pudgala* atoms is *dravya karma*, and the qualities are *bhava karma*.

## Karmavipaka: The Causes of Bondage

Karmavipaka are known as the causes of bondage. Their brief explanation should be understood as follows:

**Mithyatva:** Also known as Mithyadarshana, it is the opposite of Samyagdarshana. Samyagdarshana is the interest in believing and understanding the true nature of things, while Mithyadarshana is the belief in the untrue nature of things.

This untrue belief occurs in two ways: (1) Absence of true belief in the object and (2) Untrue belief in the object. The difference between the first and second type is that the first can occur even in the state of ignorance (Mootadash), while the second occurs only in the state of thought (Vichardash). Even when the power of thought develops, if due to prejudice, one clings to a single perspective, then that perspective is called Mithyadarshana, even though the state of thought exists. But when the state of thought is not awakened, then there is only ignorance due to the ancient covering (Aanadikalin Avaran). At that time, there is no belief in the truth, and similarly, there is no belief in the untruth.

## First Karma Granth

There is no faith in the **Karma Granth**. In that state, the lack of faith in the truth is called **Ashwadhan**. This is called **Anbhigrihit** because it happens naturally, without any external influence. And the **Mithyadarshan** that happens due to some reason is called **Abhigrihit Mithyadarshan**.

**Abhigrihit Mithyadarshan** is possible in developed beings like humans, while **Anbhigrihit Mithyadarshan** is possible in undeveloped beings like insects.

**Avirati** - Not abstaining from sinful deeds.

**Pramad** - Forgetfulness of the self, meaning not having respect for good deeds, not being careful about remembering what should be done and what should not be done.

**Kashaya** - That which destroys the qualities of the soul or that which increases the cycle of birth and death.

**Yoga** - The activities of the mind, speech, and body, meaning movement and action, are called **Yoga**.

Although specific causes of bondage for **Jnanavarana** and other karmas have been mentioned, which are also mentioned elsewhere in this text, these five are called the general causes of all karmas. There is a rule that where the earlier causes of bondage exist, all the subsequent causes will also exist. For example, if **Mithyatva** exists, then **Avirati** to **Yoga** will also exist.

1. **Kayavangmanahkarma Yoga:**
– **Tattvapansutra**, Chapter 6, Sutra 1

Page #88:
---------------------------
## Karmavipaka

Until the end of the karmavipaka, all four causes will be present, and in the case of aviriti, the three causes of pramada, etc., will also be present. Similarly, one should understand the causes of pramada, vayu, and yoga in a sequential manner. However, when the future bandhahetu is present, the previous bandhahetu may or may not be present. For example, in the first gunasthan, mithyatva is present along with aviriti, but in the second, third, and fourth gunasthan, mithyatva is not present even when aviriti is present. Similarly, one should understand this for other bandhahetus.

There are three traditions regarding the number of bandhahetus for karmabandha: (1) Kshaya and Yoga, (2) Mithyatva, Aviriti, Kshaya, and Yoga, (3) Mithyatva, Aviriti, Pramada, Kshaya, and Yoga. However, despite the difference in number and names, there is no difference in these traditions from a tattvic perspective. Pramada is a type of asanayam, so it is included in aviriti or kshaya. From this perspective, in texts like Karma-prakriti, only mithyatva, aviriti, kshaya, and yoga are mentioned as the four bandhahetus. If we consider these in more detail, mithyatva and aviriti are not separate from the nature of kshaya. Therefore, kshaya and yoga are considered the main causes of bandha. However, to explain it in detail to inquisitive people, all five, including mithyatva, are mentioned as causes of bandha. Those who are ordinary and intelligent can understand through four or five causes, while those who are particularly knowledgeable can understand through the tradition of two causes.

Thus, after explaining karma and the causes of karmabandha, the next verse explains the types of karmabandha, the root and the number of different types of karma.

Page #89:
---------------------------
## First Karma Granth

**Verse 2:**

The four types of karma bondage are described as: **nature, state, taste, and region**. There are eight **root natures** and one hundred and eight **consequent natures**.

**Explanation:**

After describing the characteristics of karma and the causes of karma bondage in the previous verse, this verse explains the different types of karma bondage and the number of root natures and consequent natures of karma.

When a living being (jiva) acquires karma particles, they take on the form of karma. At that time, four aspects are created within them. These aspects are called types of bondage. For example, when grass, etc., is eaten by cows, buffaloes, etc., it is transformed into milk. In this milk, a sweet taste is created. This taste remains in this form for a certain period of time, which is also a part of it. This sweetness also has characteristics like intensity and mildness, and the milk also has a certain quantity. Similarly, when karma particles are acquired by a living being and become connected with the regions of the soul, four aspects are created in them, which are called **nature bondage, state bondage, taste bondage, and region bondage**. Their characteristics should be understood as follows:

1. (a) There are four types of bondage: **attachment bondage, time bondage, subtle bondage, and space bondage**.
- Samvayanga, Samvay 4
(b) **Nature, state, subtle aspect, and region are of two types**.
- Tattvarth Sutra, Chapter 8, Sutra:

Page #90:
---------------------------
## Karmavipaka

**(1)  Praकृति-Bandha:** The emergence of different powers and natures within the karma-pudgalas (particles of karma) taken by the jiva (soul) is called Praकृति-Bandha.

**(2)  स्थिति-Bandha:** The time limit within which the karma-pudgalas taken by the jiva do not abandon their own nature and remain with the jiva is called स्थिति-Bandha.

**(3)  रस-Bandha:** The potential of the karma-pudgalas taken by the jiva to bear fruit is called रस-Bandha. रस-Bandha is also called अनुभाग-Bandha or अनुभाव-Bandha.

**(4)  प्रदेश-Bandha:** The connection of karma-skandhas (bundles of karma) with the jiva, having more or fewer atoms, is called प्रदेश-Bandha.

Now, the nature of Praकृति-Bandha etc. is explained through the example of laddoos (sweet balls) given in the verse.

Just as laddoos made from substances that destroy wind have the nature of destroying wind, laddoos made from substances that destroy bile have the nature of calming bile, and laddoos made from substances that destroy phlegm have the nature of destroying phlegm, similarly, some of the karma-pudgalas taken by the soul have the power to destroy the soul's knowledge-quality, some have the power to cover the soul's perception-quality, some have the power to suppress the soul's infinite power, etc. In this way,

**1. स्वभावः प्रकृतिः प्रोक्तः, स्थितिः कालावधारणम् ।**
**अनुभागो रसो शेयः प्रदेशी दलसञ्चयः ॥**

- That is, nature is called Praकृति, the time limit of the action is called स्थिति, the section is called रस, and the number of parts is called प्रदेश.

Page #91:
---------------------------
The binding of different types of natures, i.e., powers, in different karma pudgals is called **prakriti-bandha**. This refers to the arising of different inherent qualities.

Some of the aforementioned laddus have a time limit of one week, some fifteen days, and some one month for their power and nature to remain. This time limit is called **sthiti**. Upon completion of the sthiti, the laddus lose their nature, i.e., they become spoiled and tasteless. Similarly, some karmadals remain with the soul for seventy koḍa-koḍī sāgaropam, some for twenty koḍa-koḍī sāgaropam, and some for antarmūhurta. Thus, the binding of different karmadals with different sthitis, i.e., the time limits for remaining with the soul without abandoning their nature, is called **sthiti-bandha**. Upon completion of the sthiti, these karmas abandon their nature, i.e., they become separate from the soul.

Just as some laddus have more sweet taste, some have less, some have more bitter taste, and some have less, similarly, there is a difference in the intensity of sweet, bitter, etc., tastes. In the same way, some karmadals have more auspicious or inauspicious taste, and some have less. Thus, the binding or arising of various types of intense, moderate, very intense, mild, less mild, and very mild auspicious and inauspicious tastes in karma pudgals is called **rasa-bandha**.

The taste of auspicious karmas is sweet like the juice of sugarcane, etc., which makes the jiva happy. The taste of inauspicious karmas is bitter like the juice of neem, etc., which makes the jiva anxious and distressed.

Some laddus have a weight of two tolas, some have a weight of a chatank, and some have a weight of a pav, etc. Similarly, some karma-skandhas have a number of atoms...

Page #92:
---------------------------
The number of **kamvipaka** is more in some and less in others. Thus, the connection of karma-dals with different atomic numbers with the soul is called **pradeshabandha**.
The being does not accept karma-skandhas made of countless or infinite atoms, but accepts karma-skandhas made of **anantaanant** (infinite times infinite and infinite parts of the Siddhas).
Of the above four types of karma-bandhas, **prakritibandha** and **pradeshabandha** are bound by **yoga**, and **sthitibandha** and **anubhagabandha** are bound by **kashaya**.
After stating the types of karma, the definition and number of the original and subsequent natures of karma are explained.
**Mulaprakriti** - The main types of karma are called **mulaprakriti**.
**Uttarprakriti** - The sub-types of the main types of karma are called **uttaraprakriti**.
There are eight **mulaprakritis** and one hundred and fifty-six **uttaraprakritis** of karma. Their names and numbers will be described in the next verse.
Names of **mulaprakritis** and number of **uttaraprakritis**:
**Iha nanasanavaranaveyamohau namgoyani. Vigdha cha pananavaduaththavisghautissayapanavihm. ||3||
1. Joga patinaes thi7 agubhag kasayo kunabd.
—Pancham karmagranya, Ga. 66**

Page #93:
---------------------------
First
Verse - In Karma Shastra, there are eight names for the fundamental natures of Karma: Jnanavarana, Darshanavarana, Vedaniya, Mohaniya, Ayu, Nama, Gotra, and Antaraya. These have five, nine, two, twenty-eight, four, one hundred and three, two, and five divisions respectively.
Special Note - The diversity of the power of Adhyavasaya Shakti in the Karma Pudgala mass taken by the Jiva creates many different natures. Although these natures are invisible, we experience and know their transformation by observing the effects of their actions. The countless effects of Karma on one or many Jivas are experienced, and the productive natures of these effects are also countless. Even though this is the case, for the sake of brevity, all of them have been classified and divided into eight parts, whose names are given below in order:
13
(1) Jnanavarana, (2) Darshanavarana, (3) Vedaniya, (4) Mohaniya, (5) Ayu, (6) Nama, (7) Gotra, and (8) Antaraya. These names

  Tattvarthasutra, A. 805

Page #94:
---------------------------
By adding the word "karma" at the end of each karma with its vipaka, the full name of that karma is formed. For example, jnanaavaranakarma, darshanavaranakarma, etc.

The reason for classifying countless karma-effects into these eight parts is so that the inquisitive person can easily understand the karma-theory. The characteristics of the eight karmas, jnanaavaranakarma, etc., are as follows:

(1) The karma that covers the jnana-guna of the soul is called jnanaavaranakarma.
(2) The karma that covers the darshanaguna of the soul is called darshanavaranakarma.
(3) The karma by which the jiva experiences worldly sensory pleasure and pain is called vedaniya karma.
(4) The karma that hinders the jiva in self-awareness and self-absorption, or the karma that destroys the samyaktva and charitra-guna of the soul, is called mohaniyakarma.
(5) The karma due to whose existence the jiva lives and due to whose destruction the jiva dies is called aayuhkarma.
(6) The karma due to whose rise the jiva is addressed by names like narak, tiryanch, manushya, dev, etc., is called namakarma.
(7) The karma that causes the jiva to be born in a high or low family, or the karma due to whose rise the jiva develops a sense of respect or disrespect, and the jiva is called high or low, is called gotrakarma. 

(From Pramaapana 23.1.288)

Page #95:
---------------------------
## First Karma Granth

(8) Karma that destroys the powers of the soul, such as giving, receiving, enjoyment, consumption, and strength, or acts as an obstacle in giving, etc., is called **Mantarayakarma**.

These eight karmas are further divided into two categories: **Ghati** and **Aghati**. **Gnanavarana**, **Darsanavarana**, **Mohaniya**, and **Antaraya** are the four **Ghati** karmas. "Ghati" is a meaningful term. These karmas are called "Ghati" because they destroy the soul's inherent qualities and its true nature. The remaining four karmas - **Vedaniya**, **Ayu**, **Nama**, and **Gotra** - are called **Aghati**. Although they do not have the power to destroy the soul's inherent qualities and its true nature, they possess the power to bind the soul to the body through its acquired qualities.

-

**Ghati** karmas:

1. **Gnanavarana** and the other eight karmas have five sub-categories for **Gnanavarana**, nine for **Darsanavarana**, two for **Vedaniya**, twenty-eight for **Mohaniya**, four for **Ayu**, one hundred and three for **Nama**, two for **Gotra**, and five for **Antaraya**. These sub-categories are called the **Uttara-Prakritis** of those respective karmas. Some texts mention a total of sixty-nine or one hundred and forty-eight sub-categories of these karmas. The reasons for these variations will be explained as needed. Here, for the sake of easy understanding for the inquisitive, the number of **Uttara-Prakritis** of **Gnanavarana** and other karmas is mentioned as one hundred and forty-eight.

Further, in the next verse, to explain the names of the **Uttara-Prakritis** of **Gnanavarana** karma, we will first describe the five categories of knowledge.

Page #96:
---------------------------
## Karma and its Results

**Karmavipak**

There are five types of knowledge: Mati, Shruta, Avadhi, Manahparyaya, and Kevala. Among these, Mati-knowledge has four sub-types, as it arises from the four senses excluding the mind and the eye.

**Explanation:**

The first of the eight karmas is Jnanavarana (obstruction of knowledge). To explain its different types, we first need to understand the different types of knowledge. Knowing the types of knowledge will make it easier to understand the types of their obstructions.

There are five main types of knowledge:

1. **Mati-knowledge:** Knowledge of an object gained through the mind and senses. It is also called Abhinibodhik knowledge.
2. **Shruta-knowledge:** Knowledge gained by hearing words. It is also defined as knowledge that follows Mati-knowledge and involves the analysis of words and their meanings. For example, hearing the word "pot" or seeing it with the eyes, and then understanding its maker, etc.
3. **Avadhi-knowledge:** 
4. **Manahparyaya-knowledge:**
5. **Kevala-knowledge:**

2. (b) "Knowledge is based on the strength of Mati, Shruta, Avadhi, and Manahparyaya." - **Tattvartha Sutra**, Chapter 1, Sutra 1

Page #97:
---------------------------
First, the knowledge of different subjects like the color, form, etc. and their related aspects is done through Shruta Jnana. The knowledge of meaning that is gained by reading and listening to scriptures is also called Shruta Jnana.

Although the origin of Shruta Jnana, like Mati Jnana, also requires the help of mind and senses, there is a difference between the two. Mati Jnana is directed towards existing objects, while Shruta Jnana is directed towards the three periods of time: past, present, and future.

Besides the difference based on the subject, there is also a difference in that Mati Jnana does not involve verbal expression, while Shruta Jnana does. This means that Mati Jnana is what is not born from the womb, i.e., not born from a mother. Like Mati Jnana, Shruta Jnana is also produced by the senses and mind, but in Shruta Jnana, the mind is more important than the senses. The senses only perceive the tangible, but the mind perceives both the tangible and the intangible. In reality, it is the mind that contemplates and thinks; as it is said, "Yathamanagmanah." The mind also contemplates the subject matter perceived by the senses, and sometimes it contemplates independently. It is also said, "Shrutamanindriyasya" (Tattvarth Sutra A. 2. Su. 20), meaning that Shruta Jnana is primarily the subject of the mind.

Avadhi Jnana is the knowledge of the form, meaning, and tangible substance that is obtained solely through the soul, without the need for the mind or senses.

Alternatively, the word "Ava" means "adhah" (below). What is below...

##  **Knowledge of Karma and its Results**

**1. Avadhijnana**

Avadhijnana is the power to know the nature of an extended object, or it can also mean a limit. It is the power to perceive material objects directly, but not immaterial ones. This is its limit. Alternatively, Avadhijnana is the activity of the soul that directly perceives external objects.

**Manahparyaya Jnana**

Manahparyaya Jnana is the knowledge of the mental states of sentient beings, within their limits, without the need for senses or mind. Sentient beings think and contemplate any object in their minds. The knowledge that directly perceives the mental results of these thoughts is called Manahparyaya Jnana. When the mind contemplates any object, it takes on different forms depending on the nature of the object being contemplated. These forms are the permutations of the mind. Manahparyaya Jnana has the power to directly perceive these permutations.

A Manahparyaya Jnani does not know any external object, field, time, or material permutations, but when they come into someone's thoughts, they know the mental states. Just as a person sitting in a closed room can see a special ceremony taking place outside and the people and objects participating in it through television, but not otherwise, similarly, a Manahparyaya Jnani, through the eyes, indirectly perceives all living and non-living beings.

Page #99:
---------------------------
First Karma Granth
Direct knowledge can be obtained only when they are reflected in someone's mind, otherwise not. A mind-reader cannot see a village, city, etc. hundreds of yojanas away. But if these villages, etc. are present in someone's mind as a memory, then they can be seen directly. Similarly, other examples should be understood.
The characteristic of mind-reading is that the subject of avadhi knowledge is also material, and the subject of mind-reading is also material. Because the mind is also material, being made of pudgala, then why can't an avadhi-knower know the mind and its permutations? So the solution is that an avadhi-knower can directly perceive the mind and its permutations, but he cannot directly perceive the substance, space, time and emotion that are reflected in it, just as a soldier understands the emotions of his comrades from afar by day through a special process of flags and by night through a process of light, and understands their emotions. But an untrained person can see the flags, light, etc. and can also see their processes, but cannot understand the emotions expressed by them. Similarly, an avadhi-knower can directly perceive the mind and its permutations, but cannot directly perceive the mental substance, space, time and emotion, while a mind-reader can. This is his special subject. If this were not his special subject, then it would be pointless to consider mind-reading separately.
Kevalgyan - knowing all the substances existing in the universe, including all their permutations in the past, present and future, simultaneously, is called Kevalgyan. That is, the knowledge that someone

## Karma Vipaka

Karma Vipaka encompasses all knowable objects without any assistance, meaning it doesn't require the mind, senses, body, or scientific instruments. It possesses the power to directly perceive all knowable objects, both formless and formed, tangible and intangible, like a universal perceiver. Therefore, it is called Keval Jnana (Omniscience).

These five types of knowledge - Mati Jnana, Shruta Jnana, Avadhi Jnana, Mana:paryaya Jnana, and Keval Jnana - are the powers of the soul. Among these, the first two - Mati Jnana and Shruta Jnana - are considered indirect knowledge (Paroksha Pramana) because they require assistance. However, Avadhi Jnana, Mana:paryaya Jnana, and Keval Jnana are direct knowledge (Pratyaksha Pramana). These three types of knowledge arise solely from the soul's inherent ability, without the aid of the mind or senses.

Although Avadhi Jnana and Mana:paryaya Jnana perceive tangible objects, they are unable to comprehend their complete essence due to the incomplete development of their consciousness. Therefore, these two types of knowledge are called Vikal-Pratyaksha (Partial Direct Knowledge). In contrast, Keval Jnana simultaneously perceives all objects, including their past, present, and future states. Hence, Keval Jnana is called Sakal-Pratyaksha (Complete Direct Knowledge).

Keval Jnana is devoid of any incompleteness or distinction because there is no object or its associated state that remains unknown to it.

Page #101:
---------------------------
## First Karma Granth

Although Matijnana and Shrutijñana are indirect in terms of Nishchayanaya, they are considered direct knowledge in terms of Vyavaharanaya. Therefore, these two are called Saavyaavaharik Pratyaksha, and the remaining three types of knowledge, including Avadhijnana, are called Paramार्थिक Pratyaksha.

Among the five types of knowledge, Matijnana, Shrutijñana, Avadhijnana, and Manahparyaya Jnana are called Kshayopaamik Jnana because they arise from the destruction of their respective Avarana Karma.  Only Kevaljnana is called Kshayik Jnana because it completely destroys its Avarana Karma.

There are no further sub-categories of Kevaljnana within Matijnana, but the other four types of knowledge, being Kshayopaamik, have sub-categories. Here, we will discuss the number and names of the sub-categories of Matijnana.

In summary, there are four categories of Matijnana, and they can further be divided into 28, 336, or 340 sub-categories.

The four categories of Matijnana are: Avagraha, Iha, Avaya, and Dharana.  Among these, Iha, Avaya, and Dharana do not have further sub-categories, but Avagraha has the following two sub-categories:

1. (a) Se ki lan sunissam? Chamihan panatan, san jaha- jaggah, Iha, Bhavao, Dharana.
- Manvisutra 26
(b) Avmahapayadharana.
- Tattvarth Sutra, A. 1, S. 15
(c) Chauvvivaha mai pananta, tan jaha- umgahammai, Ihamai, Bhavayamai, Dharanamaai.
-  Sthananga 4.4.364

## Karmavipaka

**(1) Vyajanavagraha and (2) Arthavagraha.**

Vyajanavagraha is the knowledge of general quantity without any specific conception of name, caste, etc. When the connection between the object and the senses is established, the general awareness of the object as "this is something" is called Arthavagraha. However, this knowledge is also in an unmanifest form. The extremely unmanifest knowledge that precedes this unmanifest knowledge in the form of Arthavagraha is called Vyajanavagraha.

In essence, when the senses come into contact with an object, there is an indistinct knowledge of "this is something," which is called Arthavagraha. The extremely indistinct knowledge that precedes this is called Vyajanavagraha. Vyajanavagraha occurs upon grasping the existence of the object, meaning that the perception of existence comes first, followed by Vyajanavagraha.

This Vyajanavagraha occurs through the four senses of touch, smell, taste, and sound, excluding the mind and the eye. This is because Vyajanavagraha requires the connection of the senses with the object, but the mind and the eye perceive objects from a distance, without direct contact. Therefore, the mind and the eye are called "Aapraapyakari" (incapable of grasping).

1. (a) "Ugmhe duvihe panṇatte, tam jaha-asthurgahe pa banjanumgahe ya." - Nandosootra 27
(b) "Sunissie dusi panṇatte, tam jaha-asyoghe va vanjanoggahe ceva." - Staanaanga, Staana 2, Uo 1, Soo 71
2. "Na chakshurinindyaabhyaam." - Tattvarthasootra, Ao 1, Poo 16

Page #103:
---------------------------
## First Karma Granth, Chapter 23

**The four senses of touch, taste, smell, and hearing are called "praapyakaari" because they acquire knowledge through contact with objects.**

**"Apraapyakaari" means to know objects without contact with them, while "praapyakaari" means to know objects through contact, connection, and touch.**

**This means that only the "praapyakaari" senses can perceive objects, not the "apraapyakaari" senses.**

**For example, the collyrium applied to the eye is not visible by the eye itself, and the mind perceives external objects while residing within the body.**

**Therefore, the mind and the sense of sight are not "praapyakaari".**

**For this reason, there are four types of "vyanjnavagraha":**

**(1) Sparshanendriya-vyanjnavagraha (perception through the sense of touch)**
**(2) Rasnendriya-vyanjnavagraha (perception through the sense of taste)**
**(3) Ghranendriya-vyanjnavagraha (perception through the sense of smell)**
**(4) Shrotrendriya-vyanjnavagraha (perception through the sense of hearing)**

**The very subtle knowledge acquired through the sense of touch is called "sparshateendriya-vyanjnavagraha".**

**Similarly, one should understand the "vyanjnavagraha" that occurs through the senses of taste, smell, and hearing.**

**The shortest duration of "vyanjnavagraha" is equal to an immeasurable fraction of the "avaliika" (a unit of time), and the longest duration is from two to nine breaths.**

Page #104:
---------------------------
## Karmavipaka

After explaining the four types of *matijnana* (knowledge of the mind) and their twenty-eight sub-types, including the four types of *vyanjanavgraha* (perception of meaning), we now describe the remaining twenty-four types and the number of types of *shrutajnana* (knowledge of scriptures).

*Atyuggaha* (extreme perception), *iha* (desire), *avaya* (doubt), and *dharana* (retention) are each present in the five senses and the mind, making six types for each, totaling twenty-four. Adding the four types of *vyanjanavgraha* mentioned earlier, we have twenty-eight types of *matijnana*. *Shrutajnana* has fourteen or twenty types.

**Special Note:** The four types of *vyanjanavgraha* within the twenty-eight types of *matijnana* were mentioned in the previous verse. Before explaining the remaining twenty-four types, we describe the characteristics of *arthaavgraha* (perception of meaning), *iha* (desire), *avaya* (doubt), and *dharana* (retention) mentioned in the verse.

**Arthaavgraha:** The unmanifest knowledge of an object is called *arthaavgraha*. For example, "This is something." *Arthaavgraha* does not include knowledge of the object's color, smell, etc. However, it is more specific than *vyanjanavgraha*. The duration of *arthaavgraha* is one moment.

**Iha:** The contemplation of the object known through *avgraha* (perception) in relation to dharma (righteousness) is called *iha*. In other words, the contemplation that occurs to determine the specific nature of the general object perceived through *avgraha* is called *iha*. For example, "Is this the touch of a rope or a snake?"

Page #105:
---------------------------
## First Karma Granth, Chapter 25

**Eeha:** When doubt arises about the nature of something, like whether a touch was from a rope or a snake, we engage in **Eeha**, which is a process of reasoning and considering possibilities. For example, "If it were a snake, it would have hissed when touched." Eeha lasts for an **Antarmuhurta** (a very short period of time).

**Avaya:** The definite knowledge gained through Eeha is called **Avaya**. For example, "The touch was definitely from a rope, not a snake." Avaya also lasts for an **Antarmuhurta**.

**Dharana:** The firm knowledge that prevents forgetting the object known through Avaya is called **Dharana**. It is the knowledge that retains the memory of the object known through Avaya, even after a long time. Dharana can last for a **countable or uncountable number of years**.

**Explanation:** The certainty of Avaya may fade with time as the mind shifts to other objects. However, it leaves a **Samskara** (impression) that allows for the recollection of the object when a suitable opportunity arises. This continuous flow of certainty, the resulting Samskara, and the memory arising from the Samskara, all constitute the **Dharana** process.

**Note:** All four types of knowledge (Arthaavagraha, etc.) are forms of **Matijnana** (knowledge through the mind). They are acquired through the five senses and the mind, and therefore have five **r** (characteristics).

**Reference:** Navisutra 34: "Eeha lasts for an Antarmuhurta, Avaya for an Antarmuhurta, and Dharana for a countable or uncountable number of years."

Page #106:
---------------------------
Karmavipaka, when combined with the senses and mind, results in six distinct categories for each. For example, the sense of touch, the sense of taste, the sense of smell, the sense of sight, the sense of hearing, and the mind, when combined with Arthaavgraha, result in the following six categories of Arthaavgraha:

(1) Sparshendriya-Arthaavgraha, (2) Rasnendriya-Arthaavgraha, (3) Ghranendriya-Arthaavgraha, (4) Chakshusendriya-Arthaavgraha, (5) Shrotrendriya-Arthaavgraha, and (6) Man-Arthaavgraha.

Similarly, by combining the five senses and the mind with Iha, Avaya, and Dharana respectively, six categories each should be derived.

Combining the six categories of each of these four - Arthaavgraha, Iha, Avaya, and Dharana - results in a total of twenty-four categories. Adding the four categories of Vyanjanavgraha to these categories results in a total of twenty-eight categories of Matijnana. These categories are clearly explained in the table on page 27.

After explaining the twenty-eight categories of Matijnana, we now explain the 336 and 340 categories.

The function of knowledge is to know objects. Depending on the intensity of Kshayopa-shama, knowledge sometimes knows one type of object and sometimes many types of objects. Sometimes the knowledge of an object is quick, and sometimes it is slow, etc. Therefore, the twenty-four categories that arise from the six instruments - the five senses and the mind - in the form of Arthaavgraha, Iha, Avaya, and Dharana, are related to Kshayopa-shama and the object.

##  28. Karmavipaka

Karmavipaka are of twelve types due to their diversity. The names of those twelve types are as follows:

(1) Bahu, (2) Alp, (3) Bahuvidha, (4) Ekavidha, (5) Kshipra, (6) Akshita, (7) Anishrita, (8) Nishrita, (9) Asandigdha, (10) Sandigdha, (11) Dhruva, (12) Adhruva.

Bahu means many and Alp means one. For example, Avgraha, Iha, etc., which are the four types of knowledge that know two or more books, are called Bahuprahi Avgraha, Bahugrahi Iha, Bahugrahi Avaya, and Bahugrahi Dharana. And one should understand that Avgraha, etc., which know one book, are called Alpgrahi Avgraha, etc., up to Dharana.

Bahuvidha means in many ways and Ekavidha means in one way. For example, Chiha, Uggahanati, etc., which have diversity in shape, form, color, etc., are called Bahuvidha Mogimhati, Dhuba Mogimhati, Anissiya Bhogirihada, Asandigdha Mogimhati. 

For example, Iha, etc., which have diversity in speed, etc., are called Khippa Mihati, Patta Mihati, etc., up to Asandigdha Mohani. 

For example, Avaya, etc., which have diversity in speed, etc., are called Khippa Maveti, etc., up to Asandigdha Maveti. 

For example, Dharana, etc., which have diversity in speed, etc., are called Bahudhare, Bahuvidhandhare, Poranam Ghare, Duddhara Dharana, Agnissiya Dharana, Asandigdha Dharana.

-Tattvartha Sutra, A 1, Sut 16

Page #109:
---------------------------
## First Knowledge
**26**

Those who know books of various kinds, such as those with different sizes, shapes, colors, and thicknesses, are called **bahuvidhagrahi** (multi-faceted knowledge) etc. Those who know books of the same kind, with the same size, shape, color, and thickness, are called **alpavidhagrahi** (limited knowledge) etc.

The difference between **bahu** (many) and **alp** (few) lies in the number or quantity of the object. The difference between **bahuvidha** (multifaceted) and **ekavidha** (single-faceted) lies in the type, variety, or category of the object.

**Kshipra** (swift) means quick, and **akshipra** (slow) means delayed. Those who know quickly are called **kshipragrahi** (swift knowledge) etc., and those who know slowly are called **abhipragrahi** (slow knowledge) etc.

**Anishrita** (uncertain) means not proven by evidence, and **nishrita** (certain) means proven by evidence. For example, those who know the flowers of a jasmine plant based on the previously experienced evidence of cool, soft, and smooth touch, are called **nishrita grahi** (certain knowledge) etc. Those who know the same flowers without the aforementioned evidence are called **anishrita grahi** (uncertain knowledge) etc.

The meaning of **nishrita** and **anishrita** mentioned above is also found in the commentary of the **Nandisutra**. In addition to this, the commentator of the **Nandisutra**, Acharya Malayagiri, has given another meaning: **nishrita grahi** etc. are those who acquire knowledge mixed with other religions, and **anishrita grahi** etc. are those who acquire knowledge without mixing with other religions (published by Agamoday Samiti, page 183).

**Asandigdha** (certain) means definite, and **sandigdha** (doubtful) means uncertain. For example, those who know with certainty that this is the touch of sandalwood and not a flower, are called **nishchita** (certain) etc.

Page #110:
---------------------------
## Karmavipaka

(Undoubtedly! Grahi Avgraha etc. are called and this will be the touch of Nandan or the flower, because both have coolness, thus doubtful knowledge occurring with the non-availability of the specific is called uncertain (doubtful) Nahi-Avgraha etc.
As the knowledge was before, so it is also behind, there is no difference in it, it is called Dhruvgrahan and the knowledge that occurs before and behind, the less or more in it is called Adhruvgrahan. For example - a person, when the means-materials etc. are the same, he definitely knows that subject and the other sometimes knows it and sometimes does not. The four knowledges of Avgraha etc. that definitely know the subject when the materials are present are called Dhruvgrahi Avgraha etc. and the said four knowledges that sometimes take and sometimes do not take due to the slowness of Kshayopa-sham even when the materials are present are called Adhruvgrahi Avgraha etc.
Out of the said twelve divisions of Bahu etc., the four divisions of Bahu, Alp, Bahuvidh and Alpvidh are based on the diversity of the subject and the remaining eight divisions of Kshipra etc. are based on the diversity of Kshayopa-sham.
Bahu, Bahuvidh, Kshipra, Anishrit, Asandigdh and Dhruv in these, specific Kshayopa-sham, concentration of use, habit are the intimate extraordinary causes and Alp, Alpvidh, Akshipra, Nishchit, Sandigdh and Adhruv in these, slowness of Kshayopa-sham, scattered use, unfamiliarity are the intimate extraordinary causes. The four divisions of Vyanjanavgraha and the twenty-four divisions of Arthavgraha etc. are multiplied by the twelve divisions of Bahu etc., there are 336 divisions, such as - Arthavgraha, Iha, Avaya and Dharana, each of these four has five senses and mind, so there are twenty-four divisions and these twenty-four

Page #111:
---------------------------
First Karmapranya
Multiplying the twelve categories of Bahu etc. with the twenty-four categories of Vyavaharanavagraha, we get 288 categories.  Except for the Vyavaharanavagraha of the eye and mind, the remaining four senses, namely touch, taste, smell, and hearing, generate Vyavaharanavagraha. Multiplying these four types of Vyavaharanavagraha with the twelve categories of Bahu etc., we get 48 categories. Thus, combining the 288 categories of Arthaavagraha etc. and the 48 categories of Vyavaharanavagraha, we get a total of 336 categories of Matigyan.

The reason for having forty-eight categories of Vyavaharanavagraha is that, except for the eye and mind, the remaining four senses - touch, taste, smell, and hearing - generate Vyavaharanavagraha.  However, the sequential knowledge of Iha, Aavaaya, and Dharana does not occur. Therefore, multiplying the Vyavaharanavagraha generated by the four senses of touch etc. with the twelve categories of Bahu etc., we get only forty-eight categories.

The aforementioned 336 categories of Matigyan are Shruta-nishrit Matigyan. Adding the four categories of Ashruta-nishrit Matigyan - (1) Autpattiki Buddhi, (2) Vainayiki Buddhi, (3) Karmaja Buddhi, and (4) Parinaamiki Buddhi - to these, we get a total of 340 categories of Matigyan.

The nature of these four Buddhis should be understood as follows:

1. (a) "Asooyanispattiyam Unih Pannaattam Tam Jaha
Utpattiya Vean Ah Kammiya Parinaamiya. Buddhi Ghadabdiha Butta Panchma Noaklabhai."
- Nandosutra 26
(b) "Baumaviha Buddhi Pannaata, Tam Jaha - Ppatttiya, Veanaiya, Kammiya, Parinaamiya."
- Staanaanga 4.4.364

Page #112:
---------------------------
## Chapter 32: Karma and its Results

**Outpattiki Buddhi:** This is the type of intellect that instantly grasps the pure meaning and intention of things, even without prior hearing or knowledge. This kind of intellect manifests suddenly in a situation to achieve a task.

**Banyiki Buddhi:** This intellect is acquired through service to gurus and others. It is useful in many intellectual activities and bears fruit in this world and the next.

**Karmaja Buddhi:** This intellect is gained through purposeful thinking, contemplation, and practice.

**Parinamiki Buddhi:** This intellect is acquired through long life and experiences in the world. It is used to prove things through inference, reasoning, and examples, and it benefits the world.

Thus, the discussion of Matigyan (intellectual knowledge) is complete. Although Matigyan and Shrutigyan (scriptural knowledge) are both present, Matigyan comes first, followed by Shrutigyan.

## First Karma Text

**Knowledge of Scriptures**

Now, after the description of **Knowledge of Mind**, we will describe **Knowledge of Scriptures**. There are fourteen divisions of **Knowledge of Scriptures** and twenty divisions of **Knowledge of Scriptures** with **Bos** (a term used to denote a specific type of knowledge).

**Verse 6:**

* **Apaakhar**, **Santi**, **Samm**, **Sai**, **Sapjayavasian**, **Gamiyan**, **Angpavilu**, **Ttavi**, **Eae**, **Sapdiwakkha**

These seven terms, along with their corresponding opposite meanings, make up the fourteen divisions of **Knowledge of Scriptures**.

**Verse 7:**

* **Pajjay**, **Akhar**, **Pay**, **Sandhaya**, **Padivatti**, **Tatah**, **Anuogo**, **Pahuḍapahuḍ**, **Pahuḍ**, **Vathu**, **Puva**, **Ya**, **Sa-Samasa**

These ten terms, along with the addition of the word **Samasa** to each of them, make up the twenty divisions of **Knowledge of Scriptures**.

**Explanation:**

After **Knowledge of Mind**, **Knowledge of Scriptures** is acquired in a sequential manner. Verse 6 lists fourteen divisions of **Knowledge of Scriptures**, while Verse 7 lists twenty divisions. We will first describe the fourteen divisions.

**Fourteen Divisions of Knowledge of Scriptures:**

Although only seven terms are mentioned in the verse, the remaining seven are to be understood as their opposites. Therefore, by adding the seven opposite terms to the seven terms like **Akhar**, we get the following fourteen divisions of **Knowledge of Scriptures**:

1. **Mayipurva Jan Sujan Na Mayi Syapushviya**
- **Nanda Sutra 24**

(1) Aksharashruta, (2) Anaksharashruta, (3) Sanjishruta, (4) Asanjisruta, (5) Samyakshruta, (6) Mithyashruta, (7) Sadishruta, (8) Anadishruta, (9) Saparyavasitashruta, (10) Aparyavasitat, (11) Gamikashruta, (12) Agamikashruta, (13) Angpravishtaashruta, (14) Angvahyashruta.

Although the remaining twelve categories are included within the first two categories of Aksharashruta and Anaksharashruta, there are two types of seekers: (1) Vyutpannamathi (those with sharp intellect) and (2) Avyutpannamathi (those with dull intellect). Those with sharp intellect understand the knowledge of Shruta through these two categories alone, while those with dull intellect are unable to describe or understand the remaining categories through these two categories. Therefore, the remaining twelve categories have been mentioned for their easy understanding.

The explanation of the fourteen categories of Shruta knowledge is as follows:

(1) Aksharashruta - The word 'Akshar' is derived from the root 'Kshar sanchalane'. For example, 'Na ksharati, na chalati ityaksharam' meaning knowledge is called Akshar. Knowledge is the nature of the Jiva and no substance deviates from its nature. Jiva is also a substance. Since knowledge is its nature and quality, it is not found in any other substance besides Jiva.

Knowledge never departs from the Jiva-Atma, even in the state of deep sleep, because it is the nature of the Jiva. Therefore, Shruta-Jnana is itself cognitive and because knowledge is the nature of the Jiva, Shruta-Jnana is itself Akshara. There are three types of Akshara: (1) Sanjna-Akshara, (2) Vyanjana-Akshara, and (3) Labdha-Akshara.

Sanjna-Akshara - The form, structure, and arrangement by which it is known that this is a particular Akshara is called Sanjna-Akshara. The letters of the various scripts of the world are examples of this. They convey the knowledge of those letters through their form. For example, A, Aa, I, Ee, U, etc.

Vyanjana-Akshara - The type of pronunciation that clearly conveys the meaning of the Akshara, such as A, is called Vyanjana-Akshara. In other words, Vyanjana-Akshara is simply the name of the pronunciation of the Akshara. Vyanjana-Akshara is only used in speaking.

Labdha-Akshara - To contemplate the meaning of a word by hearing it or seeing its form is called Labdha-Akshara.

Sanjna-Akshara and Vyanjana-Akshara produce Bhava-Bhuta. Therefore, both of them are called Dravya-Shruta, because the pronunciation of the Akshara conveys its meaning and it produces Bhava-Shruta.

##  36. Karmavipaka

**Labdhyakshar** is the knowledge that arises from the perception of words, following the reception of sound, through the agency of the senses and mind. As it is said, "The knowledge that arises after the reception of sound, through the agency of the senses and mind, following the perception of the meaning of the word, like 'this is a conch', etc., is called Labdhyakshar."

**(2) Anakshar:** The knowledge that is not based on letters but on sounds, is called Anakshar. This includes understanding the intentions of others through gestures like sneezing, snapping fingers, nodding, etc.

**(3) Sanjot:** Those five-sensed beings who have a mind are called Sanjnee, and their knowledge is called Sanshashrut.

There are three types of Sanjna: (1) Dirghkaliki, (2) Hetuvaadopaadeshiki, and (3) Drishtivaadopaadeshiki.

**Dirghkaliki Sanjna** is the knowledge of the past, present, and future, like "I have done this", "I am doing this", and "I will do this". This Sanjna is present in Devas, Narakas, Garbhaja Tiryachas, and humans.

**Hetuvaadopaadeshiki Sanjna** is the knowledge that is useful for the sustenance of the body, leading to the pursuit of desirable things and the avoidance of undesirable things. This Sanjna is present in beings with two senses or more, who are not Sanjnee.

**Drishtivaadopaadeshiki Sanjna** is present in the fourteen Purvadharas.

**Nandisutra, Gatha:**

1. **Uus siyam nees siyam nichham khasiyam cha diyam cha. Nissindhiamanusar am ankwara chheliyaaiye.**

## First Karma Granth, Chapter 37

(4) Those living beings who do not have a mind are called *asangi* and their *shruta* is called *asangi shruta*.

The explanation of *sangi* and *asangi* beings should be understood in relation to the *dirghkaliki*, *hetuvadopadeshiki* and *drishtivadopadeshiki* classifications.

**In relation to *dirghkaliki***: Those who have the intellect to contemplate *iha sadarth* (the purpose of this life), the path of *apoh* (definitive reasoning), *margana* (investigation of the inherent qualities), *gaveshana* (examination of the nature of the differentiating qualities), and *chinta* (reflection on how an event happened, is happening, and will happen) and have the power to understand the true nature of things are called *sangi*. All other beings are called *asangi*. Those who are born in the womb, *aupapatik* (born spontaneously), *dev* (celestial beings), or *narak* (hell beings) and have attained a mind are called *sangi*. Because contemplation, deliberation, etc., regarding the three periods of time are possible only for them. Those who have not attained a mind are called *asangi*.

**In relation to *hetuvadopadeshiki***: Those who, with intelligence, engage in actions that are beneficial for their own body, such as consuming desirable food, and refrain from actions that are harmful, such as consuming undesirable food, are called *sangi* in the context of *hetu* (reason) *upadesh* (instruction). Conversely, those who do not are called *asangi*.

**In relation to *drishtivadopadeshiki***: In this context, *drishti* refers to the knowledge of *darshan* (vision). *Samyaggyan* (right knowledge) is called *sanjna*. One who possesses such *sanjna* is called *sangi*.

## Karmavipaka

**Karmavipaka** is the result of karma. "Sanjnanam sanjna-samyagjnanam tadasyastiti sanji-samyadrstis tasya yatshruttam tatsanjishruttam samyakshrutmiti." A being with samyagdrsti and kshayopa-shaman-jnan is called a sanji, in relation to the teachings of drstivada, and strives to conquer the enemies of raga, etc. Their shrut is called sanjishrut.

(5) The shrut of beings with samyagdrsti and samyakshrut is called samyakshrut.

(6) The shrut of beings with mithyadrsti and mithyashrut is called mithyashrut.

(7) Sadishrut is that which has a beginning (a starting point).

(8) Anadishrut is that which has no beginning.

(9) Saparyavasitashrut is that which has an end.

(10) Aparyavasitashrut is that which has no end.

In relation to the paryayathik nay, shrut-jnan is sadishrut and saparyavasit. In relation to the dravyathik nay, it is anadishrut and aparyavasit.

(11) Gamikashrut is the repeated recitation of the same sutra with some special emphasis in the beginning, middle, and end, like drstivada.

(12) Agamikashrut is that which does not have the same text, like kalikashrut.

(13) Angapravishtashrut is the scripture composed by the Tirthankaras...

Page #119:
---------------------------
According to the first Karmagrantha Upadesha, the Ganadharas themselves perform the Angapravishtashruta, meaning they describe and expound the nature and essence of the Tirthankara's teachings. The Angapravishtashruta is the sutra form in which these teachings are woven by the Ganadharas. The twelve Angas, including Acharanga, are Angapravishtashruta.

(14) Angabahyashruta -  The scriptures composed by the Sthaviras, based on the Angas, are Angabahyashruta; for example, the Dashavaikalik, Uttaradhyayanasutra, etc. There are two types of Angabahyashruta: (1) Aavashyak and (2) Aavashyakvyatirikt. The scriptures that describe the subjugation of the soul through virtues are called 'Aavashyak Shruta'. There are six studies in this category: Samayik, Jinastava, Vandana, Pratikramana, Kayotsarga, and Pratyakhyana. There are many types of Aavashyakvyatirikt Shruta, for detailed explanation and information about their names, refer to the Nandisootra.

Sapyavasi and Sant (with end) both have the same meaning. Similarly, Apyavasi and Anant are synonymous. Sadi Shruta, Anadi Shruta, Sapyavasi Shruta, and Apyavasi Shruta, these four have four types each with respect to dravya, kshetra, kala, and bhava. They are as follows:

With respect to a single being, the Shruta knowledge is Sadi - with beginning and Sapyavasi - without end. This means that when a being attains Samyaktva, Shruta knowledge also arises simultaneously. Thus, Shruta knowledge is Sadi, and when the being abandons Samyaktva or becomes a Kevalgyani, Shruta knowledge ends. Thus, with respect to a single being, 1. 

(For a detailed explanation of the term 'Aavashyak', refer to the Anuyogadwarsutra, Chapter - )

Page #120:
---------------------------
## Karmavipaka and Shrutagyan

**Shrutagyan** is **sadi-sant** (limited in duration) in relation to **karmavipaka**. However, compared to all living beings, Shrutagyan is **anadi** (beginningless) and **aparyavasit** (unlimited) because it cannot be said that a particular being first received Shrutagyan and then it ended when that being attained liberation. Therefore, in relation to all living beings, Shrutagyan is **anadi** and **aparyavasit** in a continuous flow.

**In relation to the field (kshetra)**, Shrutagyan is both **sadi-sant** and **anadi-ananta** (beginningless and endless). For example, in the Bharat and Airavat fields, when Tirthankaras establish a Tirtha, the **Dwadashangi Shrutagyan** begins, and when the Tirtha ends, Shrutagyan also ends. Thus, Shrutagyan is **sadi-sant** in this context. However, in the Mahavideha field, the Tirtha never ends, so Shrutagyan is **anadi-ananta** in relation to that field.

**In relation to time (kala)**, Shrutagyan is both **sadi-sant** and **anadi-ananta**. Compared to the **Utsarpini** and **Avasarpini** periods, Shrutagyan is **sadi-sant** because it exists at the end of the third Ara, and in the fourth and fifth Aras, but it is destroyed in the sixth Ara. However, in relation to the **Nounsarpini** and **Noavarsarpini** periods, Shrutagyan is **anadi-ananta**.

**In relation to the state of being (bhava)**, Shrutagyan encompasses both **Samyakshruta** (correct knowledge) and **Mithyashruta** (incorrect knowledge) from the **Shruta** period. Shrutagyan is both **sadi-sant** and **anadi-ananta**. In relation to the **Samyakbhavas** (correct states of being) of **Bhavya** beings, Shrutagyan is **sadi-sant**, and in relation to the **bhavas** of **Abhavya** beings, **Mithyarupa** Shrutagyan is **anadi-ananta**.

**Bhavya** and **Abhavya** are both **parinamik bhavas** (consequential states of being) of living beings. **Parinamik bhavas** are the results of **dravya** (substance) that occur naturally due to the existence of the **dravya**. In other words, the natural transformation of the **dravya** is called **parinamik bhava**.

Page #121:
---------------------------
## First Mantra

**Twenty Divisions of Shrutagyan**

The text mentions ten names in the gatha, including Paryaya, Akshara, etc. By adding the word "Samas" to each of these names, we get the twenty divisions of Shrutagyan as follows:

(1) Paryaya Shruta,
(3) Akshara Shruta,
(5) Pada Shruta,
(7) Sanghata Shruta, (2) Pratipatti Shruta,
(11) Anuyogabhoot,
(13) Prabhrit-Prabhrit Shruta,
(2) Paryaya Samas Shruta,
(4) Akshara Samas Shruta,
(6) Pada Samas Shruta.
(8) Sanghata Samas Shruta, (10) Pratipatti Samas Shruta,
(12) Anuyog Samas Shruta, (14) Prabhoot-Prabhrit Samas Shruta,
(16) Prabhoot Samas Shruta,
(18) Vastu Samas Shruta, (20) Purva Samas Shruta |
(15) Prabhrit Shruta,
(17) Vastu Shruta, (16) Purva Shruta and

Before understanding these twenty divisions in detail, let's clarify the meaning of the word "Samas".

**Samas** refers to an abundance, community, or collection.

(1) **Paryaya Shruta:** The amount of knowledge that increases in the second time period from the portion of Kushruta that exists in the subtle Nigodaya Jiva obtained in the first time period of its origin.

(2) **Paryaya Samas Shruta:** The collection of the aforementioned Paryaya Shruta, meaning two, three, four, or more quantities.

(3) **Akshara Shruta:** The knowledge of a single Akshara (letter) from the obtainable Aksharas starting with "A".

Page #122:
---------------------------
## Karmavipaka

(4) The knowledge of a group of **labyaksharas**, meaning the knowledge of two, three, four, or more numbers, is called **aksharasamaschupta**.

(5) The knowledge of a group of **arthaavabodhak** letters, which form a word, is called **pad** and its knowledge is called **pavdu**.

(6) The knowledge of a group of **pads** is called **pavasamasashruta**.

(7) The knowledge of one part of one of the fourteen **marganas**, such as **gati**, is called **sanghatashruta**. For example, the **gati margana** has four divisions: **dev**, **manushya**, **tiryach**, and **narak**. Knowing one of these is **sanghatashruta**.

(8) The knowledge of many parts of one **margana** is called **sanghatasamasashruta**.

(9) Knowing all the beings in the universe through one **dwar** like **gati**, **indriya**, etc., is called **pratipattischuta**.

(10) Knowing beings through two, four, or more **dwaras** like **gati**, **indriya**, etc., is called **pratipattisamasashruta**.

(11) Knowing the **jiva** and other substances through one of the **anuyog dvara** mentioned in the verse "**satpay paruvanyaya davva pamanam cha**" is called **amuyogashruta**.

(12) The knowledge of two, three, or more **anuyog dvara** is called **anuyogsamasashruta**.

(13) The **drishtivad anga** has an authority called **praabhut-praabhrut**. Knowing one of these is called **praabhut-praabhrutshruta**.

(14) The knowledge of two, four, or more **praabhut-praabhrut** is called **praabhrut-praabhrutsamasashruta**.

Page #123:
---------------------------
-
First Karmagrantha
.
(15) Just as there is one study of many objectives, so there is one Prabhut of many Prabhrit-Prabhrit. Knowledge of that one is Prabhutbhoot.
(16) Knowledge of more than one Prabhrit is called Prabhrit Samasshrut.
(17) Many Prabhuts have one authority called Vastu. Knowledge of one in that is Vastubhoot.
(18) Ho. The knowledge of many Vastus is called Vastu Samasshrut.
(19) There is one Purva of many Vastus. Knowledge of one in that is called Purvashrut.
(20) Knowledge of up to fourteen Purvas, like two, four, etc., is called Purva Samasshrut.
The names of the fourteen Purvas are as follows: (1) Utpad, (2) Agrayaniy Pravad, (3) Viy Pravad, (4) Asti Nasti Pravad,
(5) Gyan Pravad, (6) Saty Pravad, (7) Atma Pravad, (8) Karma Pravad, (9) Pratyakhyan Pravad
(10) Vidya Pravad, (11) Kalyan, (12) Pranavad, (13) Kriyavishal
and (14) Lokvindusar.
Or, in terms of Dravya, Kshetra, Kal and Bhav, Shrutajnan is of four types. By the power of the scriptures, Shrutajnani generally know all Dravyas, all Kshetras, all Kals and all Bhavas.
Thus, the description of Shrutajnan is complete.

Page #124:
---------------------------
##  44. Karmavipaka

After explaining Mattijnan and Shrutijnan, we now describe Avadhijnan, Manahparyayajnan and Kevaljnan.

**Gathaarth:** Anugami, Vardhaman Pratipati and their respective opponents, each have six types of Bhesha.  Rijuमति and Vipulmati are the two types of Manahparyayajnan, while Kevaljnan has only one type, meaning there are no other types of Kevaljnan.

**Vishesharth:** Avadhijnan, Manahparyayajnan and Kevaljnan - these three types of knowledge are called Pratyajnan because they arise directly from the soul without the help of the mind or senses.  We will first describe Avadhijnan.

**Types of Avadhijnan:** There are two types of Avadhijnan: (1) Bhavapratyay and (2) Gunapratyay. Gunapratyay is also called Kshayopa-shamajanya.  Their detailed explanation is as follows:

**Bhavapratyay Avadhijnan:** Bhav means birth and Pratyay means cause.  Therefore, Avadhijnan that manifests during the birth process in that particular birth is called Bhavapratyay.

1. **Ohinaan-Paccharan Duviham 'Pannanam, Jaha- Bhavaach Iyam Cha Swao-vasabhiyam Cha.**
- Nandi Sutra, 6.2
2. **(a) Donh Bhavapacchaie Pannane, Tam Jaha- Devanam Chava Ne Yaanam Chaiva.**
- Syanang, Sthan 2, U. 1, Sutra 71
**(b) Bhavapratyayo'vadhi Devanar Kanaam.**
- Tattvarth Sutra, A. 1, Sutra 21

Page #125:
---------------------------
## First Karma Granth, Chapter 45

**Pratyay Avadhigyan** is the knowledge that does not require any austerities like **samyama**, **tapa**, etc. This type of **avadhigyan** is present in **devas** and **narakas** and remains with them throughout their lives.

**Gunapratyay Avadhigyan** is the knowledge that is not present at birth but arises after birth due to the power of **yama-niyama**, **vratas**, and other austerities. This type of **avadhigyan** is only present in humans and **panchendriyatyantr** beings.

**Difference in Avadhigyan**

**Bhavapratyay** and **Gunapratyay**

Although **bhavapratyay avadhigyan** also generally requires **kshayopasham** (the complete cessation of karmas) like **gunapratyay**, the emphasis here is on the **bhavas** (states of existence) due to the difference in the cause. There are certain species of beings who, upon birth, acquire the necessary **kshayopasham** and the **avadhigyan** that arises from it. These beings do not need to perform **vratas**, **tapas**, etc. in that life to attain the **kshayopasham** necessary for **avadhigyan**. Such beings, according to their state, develop **avadhigyan** immediately upon birth, and it remains with them throughout their life in that state. For example, birds acquire the ability to fly in the sky upon birth, while humans, on the other hand, cannot fly in the sky simply by being born, unless they use an airplane or other such device.

**1. Donham Khaovasa Mie Pashnatam Tam Jaha - Madhurasanam Chaiva Pachidiya-Tirishakhajogiyanam Vesha | - Swamaang, Sthan 2. Uddeo 1 Sutra 71**

Page #126:
---------------------------
## Karmavipaka

The example mentioned indicates that the bird has the power to fly in the sky from birth. Similarly, one should understand that **Bhavapratyayavadhijnana** is the knowledge that arises in Devas and Narakas at the time of their birth in their respective realms. Here, the birth is considered primary and the **kshayopasham** (cessation of karmas) is secondary. Therefore, it is called **Bhavapratyayavadhijnana** because it is primarily related to birth.

On the other hand, there are some beings who do not acquire **avadhijnana** at birth. However, through **vratas** (vows), **anusthanas** (observances), and other practices, they become eligible for **avadhijnana**. They develop specific powers and their **avadhijnana** can increase or decrease. This type of **avadhijnana** is called **Gunapratyayavadhijnana**.

**Bhavapratyayavadhijnana** remains constant throughout life, without any change or variation. However, **Gunapratyayavadhijnana** can increase or decrease, leading to variations in its intensity. Therefore, the **Gaya** (a Jain scripture) mentions six types of **Gunapratyayavadhijnana**:

1. **Anugami**: This **avadhijnana** remains even when the being moves from one place to another. It means that the **avadhijnana** that manifests in a being at a particular place continues to exist even when the being moves to a different location.
2. **Ananugami**: This **avadhijnana** does not follow the being when it moves from one place to another.
3. **Vardhaman**: This **avadhijnana** increases over time.
4. **Hiyaman**: This **avadhijnana** decreases over time.
5. **Pratipati**: This **avadhijnana** is acquired through effort and practice.
6. **Apratipati**: This **avadhijnana** is not acquired through effort and practice.

- **Sthamaang, Sthan 6, Sutra 526**

Page #127:
---------------------------
## First Karma Text

**Anugami:** A being who, upon attaining knowledge of a place, can see for countless yojanas around that place, and upon moving to another place, can also see that same extent of area. (Anu-pashchat gamanam iti anugamanam - anugachchatiti tasya bhavah anugamikam, arthat jo jeev ke sath-sath jata rahta hai, use anugamik kahte hain.)

**Ananugami:** One who does not follow, but remains in the same place where the knowledge arose, knowing the objects in that place, but not knowing them upon leaving the place of origin. For example, someone who has astrological knowledge can answer questions correctly in their own place, but not in another. This type of knowledge, which is superior only in its own place, is called ananugami.

**Vardhaman:** A knowledge that, while having a small subject matter at the time of its origin, increases day by day, encompassing the limits of substance, space, time, and emotion with increasing purity, becoming more and more extensive. Just as a spark generated from a match grows gradually with the contact of dry fuel, so should this knowledge be understood.

**Hiyaman:** A knowledge that, while having a large subject matter at the time of its origin, gradually becomes shapeless, smaller, and smallest in subject matter due to the impurity of its results.

**Pratipati:** This means falling, declining, and ending. A knowledge that disappears suddenly, like a bright lamp extinguished by a gust of wind.

Page #128:
---------------------------
## Karmavipaka

It is said that this Avadhijnana can arise and disappear at any moment in life.

**A-pratipaati:** Avadhijnana whose nature is not perishable is called A-pratipaati. Even when Kevaljnana is present, A-pratipaati Avadhijnana does not disappear because there is no rise of Avadhijnana-avaran, which would cause it to disappear. Instead, it merges into Kevaljnana, and its existence becomes insignificant in the presence of Kevaljnana, like the light of a lamp in the presence of the sun.

This A-pratipaati Avadhijnana occurs at the end of the twelfth Gunasthan of the Jinas, and after that, Kevaljnana arises with the first moment of attaining the thirteenth Gunasthan. This A-pratipaati Avadhijnana is also called Paramavadhijnana.

The difference between Hoeyaman and Pratipaati Avadhijnana is that Hoeyaman gradually diminishes over time, while Pratipaati, like a lamp, is extinguished in a single moment.

The above six types of Avadhijnana are mentioned according to the Nandisutr. However, sometimes, instead of Pratipaati and A-pratipaati, two types are considered: Anvasthit and Avashthit, making a total of six types. The characteristics of Anvasthit and Avashthit are:

**Anvasthit:** Like a wave in water, this Avadhijnana sometimes decreases and sometimes increases.

**Avashthit:** Like a mountain, this Avadhijnana remains constant.

**Note:** Although the two categories of Anupaami and Ananugaami may include differences in faults, they are discussed separately to explain the specific types like Vardhaman, Hoeyaman, etc.

Page #129:
---------------------------
## First Karma Granth, Chapter 46

**Unstable:** That which sometimes increases, sometimes manifests, and sometimes disappears is called unstable.

**Stable:** That which remains in the soul even after countless births, or which remains only until the origin of knowledge, or which remains throughout life, is called stable knowledge. - These two types are similar in characteristics to the *pratipati* and *apratipati*, but they can be considered different only in terms of name. There is no other difference.

**Description of Avadhijnana in terms of the four categories of substance, etc.:** Avadhijnana knows the substances that are the objects of knowledge. But it clarifies the extent of this knowledge, which is generated by the destruction and pacification of karma, in terms of the limits of substance, space, time, and state.

**In terms of substance:** The Avadhijnani knows and sees from the least, i.e., from the minimum, to the infinite number of substances, and from the best, i.e., from the maximum, to the totality of substances.

**In terms of space:** The Avadhijnani knows and sees from the least, i.e., from a space as small as an infinitesimal part of an inch, to the substances in the space of the entire universe. And even in the non-universe, if one were to imagine the universe divided into countless parts, the Avadhijnani would have the power to know and see them.

Although there is no substance in the non-universe, this imagination is made to show the power of Avadhijnana, that it can encompass a space as large as countless parts of the universe in the non-universe.

Page #130:
---------------------------
The power to know and see the karmic fruits, in the form of substances, is present in the Avadhijnani.  _ From the perspective of time - the Avadhijnani knows and sees the substances in the form of an infinitesimal part of the Aalika, from the lowest, and knows and sees the substances in the form of the past and future time, from the highest, up to countless Utsavini-Avarapio proofs.
From the perspective of feeling - he knows and sees the infinite permutations of the substance in the form of the lowest, and also knows and sees the infinite permutations of the substance in the form of the highest.
There are infinite distinctions of the infinite. Whether these distinctions are of any kind, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, they will still be infinite distinctions. Therefore, one should understand the difference between the lowest and the highest infinite. The meaning of infinite feeling should be understood as much as the infiniteth feeling of all feelings.
Just as the intellect and hearing of a Mithyadristi Jiva are called Kumati and Kushrut (intellect-ignorance and hearing-ignorance), similarly the Avadhijnana of a Mithyadristi Jiva is called Vibhangajnana.  After describing Avadhijnana, we now describe Manahparyayajnana.
Manahparyayajnana - There are two types of Manahparyayajnana - Rijumati and Vipulmati.
1. (a) How many types of Parinamas are there in Aṇay? Go Yama! It is said to be three types,
namely - Maiyagaṇ Parinām, Mayamāṇ Pariyām, Vimangṇāṇ Parigām.

## First Karma Granth 51

**Rjुमति** - Knowing the general nature of the substance residing in another's mind, knowing the general service of poison, is called **Rjुमति Man:paryayajnan**.

**Vipulmati** - Knowing the many synonyms of the substance residing in another's mind, i.e., knowing the synonyms of the object of contemplation with various characteristics and clarity, is called **Vipulmati Man:paryayajnan**.

**Difference between Rjुमति and Vipulmati Man:paryayajnan**

Although both Rjुमति and Vipulmati Man:paryayajnan are knowledge and therefore know the specific, Rjुमति, which is called the general perceiver, means that it knows the specifics, but not as many specifics as Vipulmati. Therefore, their difference is explained in terms of substance, field, time, and feeling.

**Substance** - Rjुमति sees and knows the infinite infinite regions of the **Manovargana** skandhas, while Vipulmati sees and knows the skandhas with more regions than Rjुमति, with greater purity and clarity.

**Field** - Rjुमति sees and knows the mental feelings of sentient beings in a field from the lowest, a fraction of an angula, to the highest, below the **Ratnaprabha** earth, up to the **Kshullak Pratar** (Kubdi Udovijay), and above, up to the surface of the **Jyotish Chakra**, and diagonally up to two and a half islands. Vipulmati sees and knows the mental feelings of sentient beings in a field that is two and a half angulas wider than Rjुमति's, in the diagonal direction.

**Time** - Rjुमति sees and knows the mental feelings of sentient beings from the lowest, a fraction of a **Patyopas**, to the highest, a fraction of a **Patyopas**.

And even more excellent than the Palyopama, he knows and sees the innumerable parts of the past, present, and future mental states, and he knows and sees the objects that are pure and free from delusion, which are thought about or will be thought about by the mind for a slightly longer period of time than the Vipulamati and the Riju.
—
From the perspective of the Riju, he knows and sees the innumerable synonyms of mental states, but he knows and sees only an infinite part of all the states, and the Vipulamati knows and sees a slightly larger number of synonyms than the Riju, pure and free from delusion.
In addition to the above characteristics, there are some other characteristics in both types of Man:paryayajnan:
The Vipulamati Man:paryayajnan is more subtle and knows more specifics clearly than the Riju.
The Riju may disappear after it arises, but the Vipulamati Man:paryayajnan does not disappear. It simply transforms into knowledge, and then its existence is Akinchitkar.
Difference between Avadhijnan and Man:paryayajnan
Avadhijnan and Man:paryayajnan are similar in the form of imperfect, incomplete, and transcendental direct perception, but they differ in purity, field, owner, and subject matter. For example,
"MA bound to know, near and far, Vipulamai is more subtle, more extensive, more pure, the third way of knowing
Near ...
"etc.

## First Karma Granth

(1) **Manahparyaya Jnana**, in comparison to **Avadhi Jnana**, knows its object in a more detailed manner. Therefore, it is purer.

(2) The scope of **Avadhi Jnana** extends from an infinitesimal part of a finger to the entire **Lok**, whereas the scope of **Manahparyaya Jnana** is limited to the **Madhyalok**, up to the **Manushottara Parvat**.

(3) The possessor of **Avadhi Jnana** can be from any of the four **Gatis**, but the possessor of **Manahparyaya Jnana** is only a **Riddhi-prapta**, **Aparamatta-samyata** human being.

(4) The object of **Avadhi Jnana** is **Dravya** with some **Paryayas**, but the object of **Manahparyaya Jnana** is only **Manodravya**.

(5) **Avadhi Jnana** can accompany the soul in the **Parbhav**, whereas **Manahparyaya Jnana** is only **Ihabhavik**.

Now, we discuss **Keval Jnana**. **Keval Jnana** is the knowledge that, without any assistance, i.e., without the help of the senses or anything else, has the power to directly perceive all knowable objects, both concrete and abstract, like a **Hastamalaka**. It is the purest form of knowledge. The other four **Kshayopaamik** knowledges, **Mati Jnana** etc., can be pure, but not the purest, whereas **Keval Jnana** is the purest. **Keval Jnana** is eternal, without any covering, everlasting, and infinite, whereas the other four **Kshayopaamik** knowledges are not like that. **Keval Jnana** has no sub-divisions.

How many knowledges can exist simultaneously, in terms of their power? Out of the five types of knowledge mentioned above, one soul can have one to...

## Karma Vipaka and the Five Knowledges

Karma Vipaka can be experienced through the attainment of four knowledges. Some beings may attain one, two, three, or even four knowledges, but never all five simultaneously. This is because if only one knowledge is present, it would be Keval Jnana (Omniscience), and since Keval Jnana is perfect, the other four knowledges, being imperfect, cannot coexist.

When two knowledges are present, they are Mati Jnana (Knowledge of Perception) and Shruta Jnana (Knowledge of Scripture). These two knowledges are always present together in all worldly beings.

When three knowledges are present, they are either Mati, Shruta, and Avadhi Jnana (Clairvoyance) or Mati, Shruta, and Mana:paryaya Jnana (Knowledge of Mind). This is because three knowledges can only exist in an incomplete state, and in that state, either Avadhi Jnana or Mana:paryaya Jnana will be present, but Mati and Shruta Jnana will always be present.

When all four knowledges are present, they are Mati, Shruta, Avadhi, and Mana:paryaya Jnana. This is because these four knowledges can coexist as they are all incomplete in nature.

The simultaneous presence of two, three, or four knowledges is possible due to the potential for their manifestation, not their actual expression.

Mana:paryaya Jnana and Keval Jnana are only attained by those who practice the five great vows (Panch Mahavrata), not by others.

Thus, there are 28 types of Mati Jnana, 14 or 20 types of Shruta Jnana, 6 types of Avadhi Jnana, 2 types of Mana:paryaya Jnana, and 1 type of Keval Jnana. Combining all these types, there are 51 or 57 types of the five knowledges.

After describing the five types of knowledge, the following verses continue:

1. (a) Jivaabhi. Pratipatti 3, Sutra 41
(b) Ekadini Bhajyani Gugpadekasminnachaturbhyah.
- Tattvarth Sutra A 1, Sutra 30

Page #135:
---------------------------
The first Karma Granth states the number of distinctions of their coverings and Darshanavaran Karma.
The covering which falls on the eye, like a blindfold, is called the covering of that knowledge. Darshanavaran Karma is like a gatekeeper and has four Darshanavaran and five Nidra, totaling nine distinctions.

**Gathaarth:** The covering of these Matigyan, etc., knowledges, like a blindfold on the eye, is called the covering of those knowledges. Darshanavaran Karma is like a gatekeeper and has four Darshanavaran and five Nidra, totaling nine distinctions.

**Special Meaning of Jnanavaran Karma:** Karma that covers knowledge is called Jnanavaran. Just as a blindfold on the eye obstructs vision, similarly, due to the influence of Jnanavaran Karma, the soul is obstructed in knowing substances. But this obstruction is not such that the soul does not have any knowledge at all. Just as even when the sun is obscured by dense clouds, some light of the sun remains, enabling the distinction between day and night, similarly, no matter how thick the covering of Karma may be, the soul always retains some knowledge. Because knowledge is the quality of the soul, and the covering can only obscure the quality of knowledge, it cannot completely destroy it. Even when covered, only an infinite part of knowledge remains eternally uncovered. If knowledge were to be completely destroyed, then:

**1. All living beings would become non-living.**

—Chandrasutra 75

Page #136:
---------------------------
## Karma and Its Consequences

There is no distinction between the soul (Jiva) and non-soul (Ajiva). Knowledge (Jnana) is not considered a quality of the soul. Knowledge is the means by which the distinction between the soul and non-soul is made, as knowledge is a quality of the soul and not of the non-soul. The nature of the soul is eternal and cannot be destroyed. Therefore, the Karma of knowledge-obscuring (Jnana-Avarana) can only cover the qualities of the soul, not destroy them completely.

The analogy of a blindfold used here signifies that the thickness of the blindfold, whether it is thick or thin, will determine the extent of vision. Similarly, the power of the knowledge-obscuring Karma varies in its ability to cover.

Based on the five types of knowledge mentioned earlier, there are five corresponding types of Karma that obscure them:

1. **Mati-Jnana-Avarana:** This Karma obscures the knowledge of perception (Mati-Jnana). Different types of perception are obscured by different types of Karma, but all are collectively referred to as Mati-Jnana-Avarana because they are all forms of perception.

2. **Shruta-Jnana-Avarana:** This Karma obscures the knowledge gained through scriptures (Shruta-Jnana).

3. **Avadhi-Jnana-Avarana:** This Karma obscures the knowledge of clairvoyance (Avadhi-Jnana).

4. **Manah-Paryaya-Jnana-Avarana:** This Karma obscures the knowledge of mental perception (Manah-Paryaya-Jnana).

5. **Kevala-Jnana-Avarana:** This Karma obscures the perfect knowledge of omniscience (Kevala-Jnana).

(b) Sthananga, Sthan 5, U. 3, Sutra 464

(c) Tattvarth-Sutras, A. 6, Sutra 6

Page #137:
---------------------------
The first Karma Granth, Shruta Jnana, Avadhi Jnana and Manah Paryaya Jnana, should be understood as Shruta Jnana Avarana, Avadhi Jnana Avarana, Manah Paryaya Jnana Avarana respectively. 

Shruta Jnana Avarana is the Karma that covers Shruta Jnana.
Avadhi Jnana Avarana is the Karma that covers Avadhi Jnana.
Manah Paryaya Jnana Avarana is the Karma that covers Manah Paryaya Jnana.
Kevala Jnana Avarana is the Karma that covers Kevala Jnana.

The above five types of Jnana Avarana Karma are of two types: Sarvaghati and Deshaghati. The nature that completely destroys its Patia Jnana Guna is Sarvaghati, and the one that partially destroys its Ghatiya Jnana Guna is Deshaghati. Mati Jnana Avarana, Shruta Jnana Avarana, Avadhi Jnana Avarana, Manah Paryaya Jnana Avarana are all Deshaghati, and Kevala Jnana Avarana is Sarvaghati. Even though Kevala Jnana Avarana Karma is Sarvaghati, it cannot completely cover the Jnana Guna of the soul, but it completely inhibits Kevala Jnana.

The example of a doorkeeper is given for the nature of Darshan Avarana Karma. Just as a doorkeeper sitting at the royal gate does not allow anyone to see the king, similarly Darshan Avarana Karma does not allow the Jiva to see the objects. 
- Stananga Sutra 241105

Page #138:
---------------------------
Karmavipaka obstructs the power to see. Darshanavaran karma has nine divisions, which are the four Darshanavaranchatushk and the five Nidras. The names and characteristics of the Darshanavaranchatushk are mentioned in the following verse.

**Verse 10:**
"Chamvitthi, Achal, Sesidiya, Ohi Kevalehi Cha. Dansanamiha Samannam Tassavaranam Tayam Chauha."

**Translation:**
"There are four types of Darshan: through the eyes, through the other four senses, through the mind, through Avadhi, and through Kevala. Here, the perception of the common characteristics present in an object is called Darshan. Four types of Darshan have been mentioned, therefore, there should be four types of karma that cover them."

**Nature of Darshanavaran Karma:**

**Explanation:**
Every object has two characteristics: common and specific. The characteristic that reflects the existence of objects, as opposed to the specific characteristic, is called Darshan. The karma that covers Darshan is called Darshanavaran.

**Four Types of Darshan:**
There are four types of Darshan: Chakshudarshan, Achakshudarshan, Avadhidarshan, and Kevaladarshan.

**Four Types of Darshanavaran:**
The karma that covers these four types of Darshan are: Chakshudarshanavaran, Achakshudarshanavaran, Avadhidarshanavaran, and Kevaladarshanavaran.

**Characteristics of Chakshudarshanavaran:**
The perception of the common characteristics of an object through the eyes is called Chakshudarshan. The karma that obstructs this perception through the eyes is called Chakshudarshanavaran.

Page #139:
---------------------------
56
First Karma Granth
Attaskhudarshan is the perception of the general characteristics of its own subject matter by the four senses, excluding the eye, and the mind. The karma that covers it is called Anamanaran.
Avidhidarshanavaran - The knowledge of the general characteristics of the substance called the soul without the help of the senses and mind is called Avidhidarshan. The karma that covers it is called Avidhidarshanavaran.
Kevaldarshanavaran - The knowledge of the general characteristics of all substances is called Kevaldarshan and the karma that covers it is called Kevaldarshanavaran.
The reason why Manahparyayadarshan is not considered like Avidhidarshan is that Manahparyayajnan, due to the effect of Kshayopa-sham, perceives the special characteristics of substances, not the general characteristics.
Due to the rise of Chakshudarshanavaran karma, one-sense, two-sense and three-sense beings are born without eyes and the eyes of four-sense and five-sense beings are destroyed due to the rise of the said karma or become less visible due to blindness etc. eye diseases. Similarly, the absence of the remaining four senses and mind from birth or being weak or unclear even after birth is due to the rise of Achak-shudarshanavaran karma.
After stating the four divisions of Darshanavaran karma, the remaining five divisions, namely Nidra, Nidra-Nidra etc. and Vedaniya karma are stated in the next two verses.

**Gathaarth:**  Sleep that is easy to overcome is called **nidda**, sleep that is difficult to overcome is called **niddanidda**. Sleep that comes while sitting or standing is called **prachala**, and sleep that comes while walking is called **prachala-prachala**. Sleep that occurs during the night, where the mind continues to work on the day's thoughts, is called **sthyanaddhi nidda**. In this sleep, the tongue becomes half-curved, meaning it has half the strength it normally has due to the power of Vasudeva. Vedaniya karma is like licking the edge of a sword smeared with honey (madhu). This karma is of two types. 

**Vishesharth:** The previous gatha described four types of **chakshudarshanavaran** from the nine types of **darshanavaran karma**. The remaining five types of **darshanavaran karma** and **vedaniyakarma** are described here. The five types of **darshanavaran karma** are: **nidda, niddanidda, prachala, prachala-prachala, and sthyanaddhi**. Their characteristics are as follows:

1. (a) **Gavavihe dabhanavaranijnam karma panate, tam jaha-nidda, niddanidda, payana, palapalayala, yiangiddhi chanakhudasanavaran, achakhudasanavaran, ohi dasanavaran, kevaladasanavaran.** - **Sthananga, Sta. 6, Sutra 668**
(b) **Uttagamyam na stra, a. 33, matha 5, 6**

---------------------------
## First Karma Granth

**Nidra:** The karma whose arising causes a living being to experience sleep in such a way that they can wake up comfortably, i.e., it doesn't take effort to wake them up. Such sleep is called Nidra.

**Nidra-Nidra:** The karma whose arising makes it extremely difficult to wake a living being from sleep, i.e., the sleeping being wakes up with great difficulty even when shouted at loudly or shaken. Such sleep is called Nidra-Nidra.

**Prachala:** The karma whose arising causes sleep to come on while sitting or standing is called Prachala.

**Prachala-Prachala:** The karma whose arising causes sleep to come on while walking is called Prachala-Prachala.

**Styanadhi:** The karma whose arising manifests the ability to perform a previously planned action in a state of sleep. In this sleep, the living being performs impossible actions that are not possible in a waking state, and upon waking, they have no memory of the actions performed in their sleep.

**Styanadhi** is also called **Styanagrudhi**. The sleep whose arising manifests special strength in the sleeping state (Styane Swapne Yaya Veerya Visheshpradurbhava: Sa Sthanati) or the sleep in which the concentration of thoughts and resources related to the desired object occurs during the day.

## 62
## Karma Vipaka

**Styanagridhi Nidra** (Styanasandhaatibhuta Gridhivinchintitarth Sadhan Vishayaabhikanksha Yasyaam Sa Styanagridhi) is called **Styanagridhi Nidra**.

In Prakrit language, 'dd' is used instead of 'p' in 'swapana'.

If a being with Vajra Rishabhanaraach Samhanan experiences Styan Nidra, then it has half the strength of Vasudeva. This being, upon death, goes to hell.

**Darshan** Karma is of two types: **Deshghati** and **Sarvaghati**. Chakshudarshanaavaran, Achakshudarshanaavaran, Avadhi Darshanaavaran are **Deshghati**, and the remaining six **Prakritis** are **Sarvaghati**. Among the **Sarvaghati** **Prakritis**, **Kavaladarshanaavaran** is the main one.

After describing the nine types of **Darshanaavaran** Karma, we now describe **Vedaniya** Karma. **Vedaniya** Karma is like licking a honey-coated sword. It is the karma that is done by the senses. It causes the experience of **Indriya** pleasure and pain. There are two types of **Vedaniya** Karma: **Saata Vedaniya** and **Asaata Vedaniya**.

1. (a) **Saata Vedaniya**: The nature of this karma is the experience of objects, i.e., **Vedana**. This karma causes the being to experience objects.
(b) **Veshaniya**: This is the karma that is done by the senses.
(c) **Sadasa**: This is the karma that is done by the mind.

Page #143:
---------------------------
The First Karma Granth
and it is Vedaniya.
The seven Vedaniya times are like a set, like licking honey on the edge of a sword.
Saataavedaniya - The karma that causes the soul to experience sensual pleasure is called Saataavedaniya karma. Asaataavedaniya - The karma that causes the soul to experience pain in the non-attainment of favorable objects and the attainment of unfavorable sensual objects is called Asaataavedaniya karma.
63
The pleasure and pain that the soul experiences through Vedaniya karma should be understood as sensual pleasure and pain. The experience of the soul's own nature of happiness does not arise from the rise of any karma. The experience of pleasure and pain caused by Vedaniya karma is temporary.
The verse uses the analogy of the edge of a sword smeared with honey to indicate that worldly pleasure is mixed with pain. There is no peace in it. The results are Kalup, which are the cause of increasing the world.
Now, in the next verse, we begin the explanation of Mohaniya karma, explaining the nature of Vedaniya karma in the four paths.
Oson' Suramanuaye Sayam Sayam Tu Tiriyanareasu. Majjam Va Mohaniyam Duviham Dansancharanmoha || 13 || 0 Verse - In the Deva and Manusya paths, Saataavedaniya karma usually arises, and in the Tiryanch and Naraka paths, Asaataavedaniya karma arises. The nature of Mohaniya karma is like alcohol and

Page #144:
---------------------------
## Faravipak

Faravipak is of two types, in relation to Darshanmohaniya and Charitramohaniya.

**Special Note:**  Living beings, who wander in the cycle of four gatis (states of existence), experience pleasure and pain arising from Vedaniya karma. They do not experience pure pleasure or pure pain. Their pleasure is mixed with pain, and the cycle of pleasure followed by pain, and pain followed by pleasure continues. However, the first part of the verse states which gatis experience predominantly Saatavedaniya and which experience predominantly Asaatavedaniya. 

It is stated that Devas (gods) and Manusyas (humans) predominantly experience Saatavedaniya karma. The word "predominantly" indicates that they also experience Asaatavedaniya karma, albeit in smaller amounts. 

For example, when many Devas are about to be expelled from their Devagati, they experience envy, jealousy, etc., upon seeing the greater power of other Devas compared to their own. This, and other similar occasions, lead to the arising of Asaatavedaniya karma. The same understanding should be applied to humans. They also experience pain due to pregnancy, separation from loved ones like wives and children, loss of wealth, etc.

Tiyanchas (animals) and Naraka (hell) beings predominantly experience Asaatavedaniya karma. The word "predominantly" indicates that they also experience Saatavedaniya karma, but such occasions are rare. For example, some animals like elephants, horses, dogs, etc., experience...

Page #145:
---------------------------
**First Karma Granth**

Just as a child is nurtured with great love and affection, similarly, even Naraka beings experience some happiness during the birth and other auspicious events of Tirthankaras.

Devas experience worldly pleasures in abundance, while humans experience them less. Similarly, Nigodaya beings and Narakas experience suffering in abundance, while other Tiryanch beings experience it less.

After discussing the Dhredaniya Karma, we now describe the Mohaniya Karma, which is next in order.

**The Nature of Mohaniya Karma**

The nature of Mohaniya Karma is like that of alcohol (madya). Just as an intoxicated person forgets his own identity, similarly, with the rise of Mohaniya Karma, the being loses the ability to recognize and discern his own nature and welfare. Even if he somehow gains the ability to discern his welfare, he is unable to act accordingly.

There are two types of Mohaniya Karma: (1) Darshanmohaniya and (2) Charitramohaniya.

**Darshanmohaniya** - Here, Darshan should be understood as Shraddha (faith).

1. (a) "Mohanijje nam mante! Kamme kativih panate? Goyama! Dubihe panale. Tam jaha - Dasanmohanijje va Charittamhohanijje pa."
- Prajapana. Karmabandh par 23, Ja 2 (s)
(b) "Mohanijj pi dubih dasane charane taha."
- Uttaradhyayayana A. 33, Ga.

Page #146:
---------------------------
## Karmavipaka

One should not accept the common usage of the term "darshan" (perception). It is different from this perception. Therefore, to understand something as it is, is "darshan", i.e., "tattvarth-shraddha" (faith in the truth) is called "darshan". This is a quality of the soul. The karma that destroys or causes this "darshan" is called "darshanamohaniya" (that which obscures perception).

"Charitra" (conduct) is the attainment or immersion in the nature of the soul. This is a quality of the soul. The karma that destroys this "charitra" quality of the soul is called "charitramohaniya" (that which obscures conduct).

Thus, after explaining the main divisions of "mohaniya" karma, the next verse describes "darshanamohaniya" in detail.

**Verse 14:**

"Vansanmoham tiviham samm mosam tahev micchattam. Suddh addhavassudd avisudd tam habai kamaso."

**Meaning:** "Darshanamohaniya" karma is of three types: "samyaktvamohaniya" (that which obscures right faith), "mishramohaniya" (that which obscures mixed faith), and "mithyatvamohaniya" (that which obscures wrong faith). Of these three types, "samyaktvamohaniya" is pure, "mishramohaniya" is semi-pure, and "mithyatvamohaniya" is impure.

**Explanation:**

"Darshanamohaniya" karma is of the nature of "mithyatva" (wrong faith) in terms of bondage, but in terms of its arising and existence, it is divided into three types due to the soul's transformations: "samyaktvamohaniya", "mishramohaniya" (samyamithyatva-mohaniya), and "mithyatvamohaniya". Their characteristics are as follows:

1. (a) "Dansanmohanijj bhanta! Kramm katidhi ghe nnaroo? Goyama! Tishihe panatte, tam jaha-sammann veyanijje, micchattabaganijje. Sammamicchattaveyanijje." - Prajnapana, Karmabadh, Chapter 23, Verse 2.
(b) Uttaradhyayanasutra, Chapter 33, Verse 6.

Page #147:
---------------------------
## First Karma Text
**67**

**Samyaktvamohaniya:** A karma whose arising, though caused by a desire for the true nature of things, restricts the true desire that is either *aupashamik* (temporary) or *kshayik* (destructive) is called *Samyaktvamohaniya*. Although this karma, due to its purity, does not obstruct the true nature of things, it prevents the attainment of *Samyaktv* (right knowledge) which is *aupashamik* and *kshayik* in nature. It also creates doubt in the contemplation of subtle substances, leading to impurities in *Samyaktv*.

**Mishramohaniya:** This is also called *Samyaktv-Mithyatvamohaniya*. A karma whose arising causes the living being to remain in a fluctuating state, neither truly desiring nor disliking the reality, is called *Mishramohaniya*. Due to its arising, the living being neither develops a desire for the true nature of things nor a dislike for the untrue. This desire should be understood as similar to the taste of a mixture of earth and clay.

**Mithyatvamohaniya:** A karma whose arising prevents the living being from desiring the true nature of things is called *Mithyatvamohaniya*. Due to the arising of this karma, the living being does not follow the path of omniscience but instead walks on its opposite path. It remains alienated from the right path, does not have faith in the true nature of things like the living being and non-living being, and is unable to contemplate its own benefit and harm. It considers benefit as harm and harm as benefit.

The *pudgal* (matter) of *Mithyatvamohaniya* has a *sarvaghati* (all-destroying) taste. This taste has four types: *ekasthānak*, *dvisthānak*, *tristhānak*, and *chatusthānak*. Their explanation is as follows: If one takes one kilogram of juice from neem or sugarcane, then its original natural taste is called *ekasthānak*. But when this one kilogram of juice is mixed with other tastes, it is called *dvisthānak*.

Page #148:
---------------------------
If the intensity of the karmic result is reduced by half, it is called **Dwistahanak**. If it is reduced by two parts and one part remains, it is called **Tristahanak**. And if only one-fourth part remains, it is called **Chatuhstahanak**.

In common language, **Chatuhstahanak** can be called one-fourth, **Tristahanak** one-third, **Dwistahanak** one-half, and the natural state can be called **Ekstahanak**.

Similarly, the strongest power of karma that gives auspicious and inauspicious results should be understood as **Chatuhstahanak**, the very strong power as **Tristahanak**, the strong power as **Dwistahanak**, and the weak power as **Ekstahanak**. Among these, **Dwistahanak**, **Tristahanak**, and **Chatuhstahanak** are **Sarvaghati** (all-destroying) **rasa** (taste). In **Mithyatvamohaniya** (false belief-inducing), there are all three types of **Sarvaghati** **rasa** power: **Chatuhstahanak**, **Tristahanak**, and **Dwistahanak**. In **Mishramohaniya** (mixed false belief-inducing), there is **Ekstahanak** **rasa** power, and in **Mabyaktvamohaniya** (obscuring the true nature), there is **Ekstahanak** **rasa** power.

Just as there is intoxication in eating **Kodrab** (a type of grain), but when the husk of the **Kodrab** is removed and it is washed and purified with buttermilk, etc., the intoxicating power becomes very low. Similarly, **Mithyatvamohaniya** karmic particles, which make the being fail in the examination of what is beneficial and harmful, are like **Kodrab**. They have **Sarvaghati** **rasa**, but when the being, by the power of its pure **parinama** (results), reduces the **Sarvaghati** **rasa** power of these karmic particles and only **Ekstahanak** remains, then these **Mithyatvamohaniya** karmic particles with **Ekstahanak** power are called **Samyaktvamohaniya** (right belief-inducing). And **Mishramohaniya** karmic particles should be understood like **Kodrab** that is partly pure and partly impure. In these karmic particles...

Page #149:
---------------------------
The first type of karma is called *granya*, the second is *dvi-sthana*, and the third is *ras*. Of these three, *mithyatva-mohaniya* is the most destructive, while the other two, *samyak-tva-mohaniya* and *mitra-mohaniya*, are less destructive. 

This is how the three types of *darshan-mohaniya* are explained. Now, in the following verse, the nature of *samyak-tva-mohaniya* is described:

**Verse 5:**

*Jiya-jaya punna-pavasa sanvara-bandha-mukkha-nijjarana.
Jena sad-dhaaiyam taya samm khaiga-gaha-bahu-meyam.*

**Meaning:**

The karma that causes a being to have wrong beliefs about the self, non-self, merit, demerit, inflow, restraint, bondage, liberation, and the cycle of birth and death is called *samyak-tva-mohaniya*. It has many sub-types, such as *kshayika* and others.

**Explanation:**

The karma that causes the soul to have faith in the nine principles (jiva, ajiv, punya, papa, asrava, sanvara, nirjara, bandha, and moksha) is called *samyak-tva-mohaniya*. This means that even though this karma acts as a veil, it does not prevent the soul from having true faith in the principles.

**The Nine Principles:**

* **Jiva:** The living being.
* **Ajiv:** The non-living being.
* **Punya:** Merit.
* **Papa:** Demerit.
* **Asrava:** Inflow of karma.
* **Sanvara:** Restraint of karma.
* **Nirjara:** Exhaustion of karma.
* **Bandha:** Bondage.
* **Moksha:** Liberation.

**Characteristics of Jiva:**

A being that possesses life is called a *jiva*. There are two types of life: *dravya-pran* (physical life) and *bhava-pran* (mental life). *Dravya-pran* includes the five senses (touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing), the three powers (body, speech, and mind), and the nine *sam-bhava-payatya* (potential for existence).

Page #150:
---------------------------
## Karma and its Results

**Karmavipak**

There are ten divisions of karma: lifespan and respiration. Knowledge, perception, and other natural qualities are called **bhavpranas**.

**Jiva**

There are two types of **jiva**: (1) **Muktajiv** and (2) **Sansarijiv**. 

* **Muktajiv**: Those who have completely destroyed all their karma and are endowed with knowledge, perception, and other **bhavpranas** are called **Muktajiv**.

* **Sansarijiv**: Those who are endowed with their respective **dravya-pranas** and **bhavpranas** like knowledge, etc., and wander in the cycle of existence, including hell, etc., are called **Sansarijiv**.

There are fourteen divisions of the **jiva** principle.

**Ajiv**

That which does not have life, i.e., is inert, is called **Ajiv**. **Dharma-astikaya**, **Adharma-astikaya**, **Akasa-astikaya**, **Pudgala-astikaya**, and **Kala** are **Ajiv**. Among these, **Pudgala-astikaya**, i.e., those with form, taste, smell, and touch, are material, while the remaining four are immaterial, i.e., devoid of form, etc. There are fourteen divisions of the **Ajiv** principle.

**Punnya**

That which, upon its fruition, brings happiness to the **jiva**, is called **Punnya**. There are two types of **Punnya**: (1) **Dravya-Punnya** and (2) **Bhavpunya**. 

* **Dravya-Punnya**: The karma that brings happiness to the **jiva** upon its fruition.

* **Bhavpunya**: The auspicious results of the **jiva**, such as compassion, kindness, charity, and good thoughts.

**Punnya** is of the nature of auspiciousness and is bound by auspicious **yoga**. There are forty-two divisions of **Punnya-prakriti**.

**Pap**

That which, upon its fruition, brings suffering, separates the soul from good deeds, is called **Pap**. There are two types of **Pap**: **Dravya-Pap** and **Bhavppap**.

* **Dravya-Pap**: The karma that brings suffering to the **jiva** upon its fruition.

* **Bhavppap**: The inauspicious results of the **jiva**.

**Pap** is of the nature of inauspiciousness and is bound by inauspicious **yoga**. There are forty-two divisions of **Pap-prakriti**.

Page #151:
---------------------------
## First Fundamental Text

**Asrava** refers to the gateway through which auspicious and inauspicious karmas enter. There are two types of Asrava: **Dravyasrava** and **Bhavasrava**. **Dravyasrava** refers to the tendencies that produce auspicious and inauspicious results or are themselves produced by auspicious and inauspicious results. **Bhavasrava** refers to the gateway through which karmas enter the soul, leading to auspicious and inauspicious results. There are forty-two types of Asrava.

**Samvara** refers to the restraint of Asrava. There are forty-two types of Asrava, and the restraint of each type of Asrava, to the extent it is restrained, is called Samvara. This Samvara (restraint of Asrava) is achieved through **Gurit**, **Samiti**, **Dharma**, **Anupreksha**, **Parishhajay**, and **Charitna**, etc. There are two types of Samvara: **Bhavasamvara** and **Dravyasamvara**. **Bhavasamvara** refers to the restraint of the soul's tendencies that prevent new karmas from entering, while **Dravyasamvara** refers to the cessation of the influx of karma particles. There are fifty-seven types of Samvara.

**Nirjara** refers to the gradual destruction of karma particles that are intertwined with the soul like water and milk. There are two types of Nirjara: (1) **Dravyanirjara** and (2) **Bhavanirjara**. **Dravyanirjara** refers to the separation of karma particles from the soul's regions, while **Bhavanirjara** refers to the pure results of the soul, which are the cause or effect of **Dravyanirjara**. There are twelve types of Nirjara.

**Bandha** refers to the binding of karma particles to the soul, like water and milk, through Asrava. Through **Kashaya** (passions) like attachment and aversion, and **Yoga** (tendencies), the worldly soul binds itself to karma particles.

## Karma and its Results

The cycle continues endlessly: due to attachment (raga), aversion (dvesha), and passions (kṣayā), the soul (jīva) attracts karmic particles (karma-pudgala). These karmic particles, in turn, lead to the development of passions. Yoga and passions are the causes of karmic bondage (karma-bandha). There are two types of bondage: भावबंध (bhāva-bandha) and द्रव्यबंध (dravya-bandha). The states of the soul that lead to karmic bondage, or the states of the soul that arise from karmic bondage, are called भावबंध (bhāva-bandha). The merging of karmic particles with the soul's regions (jīva-pradeśa) like milk and water is called द्रव्यबंध (dravya-bandha). There are four types of bondage.

## Liberation (Moksha)

The complete destruction of all karmas is called liberation (mokṣa). There are two types of liberation: द्रव्यमोक्ष (dravya-mokṣa) and भावमोक्ष (bhāva-mokṣa). The complete separation of all karmic particles from the soul's regions is called द्रव्यमोक्ष (dravya-mokṣa). The pure states of the soul that lead to or arise from द्रव्यमोक्ष (dravya-mokṣa) are called भावमोक्ष (bhāva-mokṣa). There are nine and fifteen types of liberation.

## The Nine Tattvas

Out of the nine tattvas, the soul (jīva), non-soul (ajīva), and bondage (bandha) are objects of knowledge (jñeya).  Virtue (puṇya), vice (pāpa), and inflow (āsrava) are objects to be abandoned (heya). Restraint (samvara), outflow (nirjarā), and liberation (mokṣa) are objects to be cultivated (upādeya).

## Right Conduct (Samyaktvā)

Having faith in the nine tattvas, including the soul, is called completeness (sampanattvā). There are many types of right conduct (samyaktvā). From one perspective, there are two types of right conduct: (1) व्यवहारसम्यक्त्व (vyavahāra-samyaktvā) and (2) निश्चयसम्यक्त्व (niścaya-samyaktvā). From another perspective, there are क्षायिकसम्यक्त्व (kṣayika-samyaktvā), औपशमिकसम्यक्त्व (aupaśamika-samyaktvā), and क्षायोपशमिक (kṣayaupaśamika).

1.  When the soul (ātmā) is affected by attachment, aversion, and passions, it attracts karmic particles. This leads to the development of ignorance (nānāvarana) and other karmic obstacles.

**Note:** The text refers to a specific verse from a Jain scripture, "Pravachana Sūtra 2, Nav Tattva Ka Vishesh Varnan Devendra Rirchit Svopjaṭīkā Gāthā 15, Paṣṭh 30 se 32." This information is provided for context and understanding.

## First Karma Text

There are various types of **Samyaktvam** such as **Samyaktvam**, **Vedak Samyaktvam**, **Sasvadan Samyaktvam**, **Deepak Samyaktvam**, etc. In brief, their characteristics are as follows:

**Vyavahar Samyaktvam:**  Abandoning **Kuguru**, **Kudeva**, and **Kumarg** and accepting **Suguru**, **Sudeva**, and **Sumarg** and having faith in them is called **Vyavahar Samyaktvam**.

**Nischya Samyaktvam:**  Having faith in the true nature of **Jiva** and other **Tattvas** is **Nischya Samyaktvam**. This is the state of the soul where knowledge becomes pure.

**Kshayik Samyaktvam:**  The specific result in the soul due to the destruction of the three natures of **Mithyatvam**, **Mithya**, and **Lanyaktyamohaniya Darshan Mohaniya** is called **Kshayik Samyaktvam**.

**Aupashamic Samyaktvam:**  The specific result in the soul due to the suppression of the aforementioned three natures of **Darshan Mohaniya** is called **Aupashamic Samyaktvam**.

**Kshayopaashamic Samyaktvam:**  The result in the soul due to the destruction of **Mithyatvam Mohaniya Karma** and its suppression, and the rise of **Samyaktvam Mohaniya** is called **Kshayopaashamic Samyaktvam**.

The destruction of **Mithyatvam** **Pudgalas** that have arisen and the suppression of those that have not yet arisen is how **Mithyatvam Mohaniya Kshayopaashama** occurs. Here, the rise of **Mithyatvam** is the rise of **Pradeshodaya**.

## Karmavipaka

One should understand the expectation of **Raso-day** (fructification of karma), not the expectation of **Pradesho-day** (destruction of karma). In **Aupashamak Samyaktv** (state of partial liberation), neither **Mithyatva** (false belief) **Raso-day** nor **Pradesho-day** arises. **Pradesho-day** is called **Udayabhavi Kshaya** (destruction of karma without fructification). **Pradesho-day** does not affect the soul, while **Raso-day** does.

When a being in **Vedak Samyaktv** (state of liberation) or **Shayopaamik Samyaktv** (state of liberation with some residual karma) experiences the **Rasa** (taste) of the last **Pudgala** (matter) of **Samyaktvamohaniya** (karma that obscures right faith), the result is called **Vedakramyaktv**. After **Vedakramyaktv**, the being attains **Kshayik Samyaktv** (state of complete liberation).

When a being in **Swasvadan Samyaktv** (state of liberation with the ability to enjoy the fruits of karma) or **Upsham Samyaktv** (state of liberation with the ability to enjoy the fruits of karma) falls from these states and faces **Mithyatva**, the specific result of this period is called **Swasvadan Samyaktv**. **Swasvadan** is also called **Sasadan**.

**Karak Samyaktv** (state of liberation with the ability to perform right actions) is the performance of **Jinoct** (Jain teachings) actions like **Samayik** (meditation), **Pratikraman** (confession), **Guruvandana** (salutation to the teacher), etc.

**Rochak Samyaktv** (state of liberation with the ability to enjoy right actions) is the interest in **Jinoct** actions.

**Deepak Samyaktv** (state of liberation with the ability to spread right actions) is the support and propagation of the benefits of **Jinoct** actions. Similarly, one should understand the characteristics of other types of **Samyaktv**.

By mentioning **Samyaktvamohaniya**, the following verse describes the remaining types of **Darshanamohaniya** (karma that obscures right knowledge) - **Mishramohaniya** (karma that obscures right knowledge and right faith) and **Mithyatvamohaniya** (karma that obscures right faith).

## First Karma Granth

**1**
**Verse:** Just as a person born on the Nalikera island does not have attachment or aversion to food, similarly, due to the Misra-Mohaniya karma, there is no attachment or aversion to the Jina Dharma. This lasts only for the duration of Antarmuhurt. When Mithyatva-Mohaniya arises, the being becomes inclined towards faith contrary to the Jina Dharma.

**75**
**Special Meaning:** The verse explains the consequences and nature of the soul's transformation due to the arising of Misra-Mohaniya (Samyaktva Mithyatva Mohaniya) and Mithyatva-Mohaniya karma.

Just as a person born on the Nalikera island (where no food other than coconuts grows) has not heard or seen anything about food, and therefore has neither interest nor aversion towards it, but remains neutral, similarly, when Misra-Mohaniya karma arises, the being does not have interest or aversion (attachment or aversion) towards the Dharma as taught by the Vitaraga. This means they do not have firm faith that what the Vitaraga has said is true, and they also do not have aversion in the form of disbelief, considering it false and unreliable. They consider both the Vitaraga and the Saraga, and their teachings, equally acceptable. The duration of Misra-Mohaniya is Antarmuhurt.

When Mithyatva-Mohaniya karma arises, the soul does not have faith in the nature, characteristics, and Dharma as taught by the Jina, of the Jiva and other elements. Just as a sick person does not like wholesome things and likes unwholesome things, similarly, when Mithyatva-Mohaniya karma arises, the being does not like the Dharma as taught by the Vitaraga...

## Karmavipaka

There is hatred towards Dharma-principles and attachment towards opposing principles.

**Misconception** is the only difference between:

(1) **Sadhu** (righteous) and (2) **Asadhu** (unrighteous) being considered as Sadhu.

(3) Not considering **Ahimsa-mūlaka Dharma** (non-violence based Dharma) as Dharma.

(4) Considering **Himsa, Jhuth** etc. (violence, lies etc.) - **Adharma-pāpamūlaka** (unrighteous-sinful) actions as Dharma. Actions or thoughts that lead to the downfall of the soul are Adharma.

(5) Considering **Ajīva** (non-living) as **Jīva** (living).

(6) Considering **Jīva** (living) as **Ajīva** (non-living). There is no soul in plants, animals, etc.

(7) Considering **Kumārga** (wrong path) as **Sanmārga** (right path). Meaning, considering the causes of the soul's wandering in the world as good. Considering the path opposite to the **Kevalarūpita** (perfect) path as correct.

(8) Considering **Sumārga** (right path) as **Unmārga** (wrong path). Meaning, considering the causes of liberation as the causes of worldly bondage.

(9) Considering **Karma-rahita** (without karma) as **Karma-sahita** (with karma). For example, the Supreme Being is **niṣkarma** (without karma), but considering Him as the protector of devotees and the destroyer of demons.

**1. Dasavihe micchate pan tam jada - adhammam ammanna dhamme abamm sanna, amarage margamana, magge ummabhasana, ajivasri jivasana, jivesri ajivasuna, asa sahas, sahas asa sanna, amutte muuttana, mus amussana.** - **Svāmānga 10 Sūtra 734**

**First Karma Granth**
**(10)** Considering the one with karma as without karma | Protecting the devotees and destroying the demons cannot be done without attachment and aversion, yet considering them as devoid of karma is like trembling, "God does everything but is detached."
Thus, after stating the distinctions of Darshanamohaniya, now in the next verse, the distinctions of Charitramohaniya karma are described.
**Verse**
Sixteen Kasayas, nine Nokasayas, two are Charitramohaniya.  Anantaanubandhi, Apratyakhyanavaran, Pratyakhyanavaran, and Sanjwalana, these four-four distinctions make sixteen distinctions of Kasayas. || 17 ||
**Meaning of the Verse** - There are two distinctions of Charitramohaniya - Kasaya-mohaniya and Nokasaya-mohaniya. Of these, Kasaya-mohaniya has sixteen and Nokasaya-mohaniya has nine distinctions. Anantaanubandhi, Apratyakhyanavaran, Pratyakhyanavaran, and Sanjwalana, these four-four distinctions make sixteen distinctions of Kasayas.
**77**
**Special Meaning** - The main distinctions of Charitramohaniya are Kasaya and Nokasaya. Their characteristics, distinctions, etc. should be understood as follows:
**Kasaya** - That which destroys the qualities of the soul. Or, the meaning of Kas is birth-death-like samsara, its income, i.e., attainment from which

## Karmavipaka

The **kṣaya** is called **kṣaya**. There are sixteen types of **kṣaya**, which are briefly described here.

**78**

The four types of **kṣaya** in their original form are **krodha**, **māna**, **māyā**, and **lobha**. The characteristics of these four are as follows:

**Krodha** - To be filled with anger, forgetting equanimity. To be angry at another is **krodha**.

**Māna** - Pride, arrogance, false self-perception is called **māna**.

**Māyā** - Deceitfulness, i.e., the lack of unity in thought and action is called **māyā**.

**Lobha** - Attachment to the results is called **lobha**.

Due to the **tīvratam**, **nīlaratīta**, and **manda** states of these **kṣaya**, there are four types of each, which are called **anantaanubandhī** (most intense state), **apratyākyānāvaraṇa** (intense state), **pratyākhyatnāvaraṇa** (intense state), and **sanjvalana** (mild state), respectively. Their characteristics are as follows:

**Anantaanubandhī** - The **kṣaya** that destroys the **samyaktva** qualities of the **jīva** and causes it to wander in the world for an infinite time is called **anantaanubandhī**. *

**Apratyākhyānāvaraṇa** - The **kṣaya** that obstructs the **deśaviratiguṇa** and **cāritra** qualities of the soul...

## First Chapter

**(The destruction of the Shravaka state, i.e., the state where there is no partial renunciation of worldly attachments, is called A-pratyakhyana-avaran. Due to the influence of this kshaya, the attainment of Shravaka dharma does not occur.)**

**A-pratyakhyana-avaran:** The kshaya whose influence obstructs the soul from attaining the state of complete renunciation (Sarva-virati) and the attainment of Shraman (Sadhu) dharma is called A-pratyakhyana-avaran. The emergence of this kshaya does not hinder the observance of Shravaka conduct, which involves partial renunciation, but it prevents the observance of Sadharma, which involves complete renunciation.

**Sanjwalan:** The kshaya whose emergence prevents the soul from attaining the state of Yatha-khyata-charitra (conduct in accordance with knowledge), i.e., the kshaya that influences and affects the observance of Shraman dharma through Pari-shaha (endurance) and Upasarga (obstacles), is called Sanjwalan. This kshaya obstructs the observance of Sarva-virati charitra in a pure form.

The four fundamental categories of Krodha (anger), Mana (pride), Maya (delusion), and Lobha (greed) are combined with the four types of Ananta-anubandhi, etc., resulting in sixteen categories of Kshaya-mohaniya as follows:

Ananta-anubandhi - Krodha, Mana, Maya, Lobha.
A-pratyakhyana-avaran - Krodha, Mana, Maya, Lobha.
Pratyakhyana-avaran - Krodha, Mana, Maya, Lobha.

1. **A-pratyakhyana-kshaya-udayadi tinam bhavathi.** - **Tattvartha Sutra 10, Madhyama 2**
2. **Pratyakhyana-avaran-kshaya-udaya-dvirata-virati-bhavathi uttama charitra labhastu na bhavathi.** - **Tattvartha Sutra 10, Bhavyam 3**

## DO
**Karmavipāka**

**Sanjvalana-Krodha, Māna, Māyā, Lobha.**

These four types are collectively referred to as "Chatushk" or "Chaukdi" (quadruplet) for brevity. For example, when we say "Anantānubandhi Chatushk" or "Anantānubandhi Chaukdi," it encompasses all four: Anantānubandhi Krodha, Māna, Māyā, and Lobha. Similarly, we should understand the terms "Apratyaкhyānāvarana," "Pratyaкhyānāvarana," and "Sanjvalana Chatushk."

After discussing the different types of Kshayas, we now delve into the nature of "Nokashaya-Mohaniya."

**Nokashaya** -  Something that is not a Kshaya itself but arises simultaneously with the emergence of a Kshaya or assists in generating or stimulating Kshayas. Examples include Hāsya (laughter), Rati (desire), etc., which are types of Nokashaya, and their details will be discussed as needed. A verse on this topic is as follows:

> Kshayasahāvatitvātkṣayapreranāvapī |
> Hāsyāvinavakasmokka nokṣayākṣayātā ||

This means that Hāsya, etc., are considered Nokashaya because they are associated with Kshayas, arise with them, and contribute to their generation.

Therefore, we should understand the relationship of Nokashaya with other Kshayas as follows:

1. **Kshayaveya gījje ṇam mane! Ṛtiviḍhe paṇṇate?**
>  Goȳmā 1 molas viḍhe paṇṇate, tam bahā - aṇatapanuvanḍhi kohe, aṇantānubandhi māṇe, aṇantānubandhi māyā, lohe, apaccakhaṇāve kohe evam māṇe, māyā, lohe, paccaktraṇāvarane kohe evam māṇe, māyā, lohe, sanjalana kohe evam māṇe māyā lohe.

- Prajñāpanā, Karmabandhapara 23, U. 2

Page #161:
---------------------------
**Manath**

The cooperation of kṣayās is essential for nokṣayās to attain the form of kṣayās, and it is only through their contact that nokṣayās are expressed. However, they are inactive in themselves. Only nokṣayās are not the main ones.

Thus, after briefly indicating the sub-divisions of the two divisions of kṣayā-mohaniya and nokṣayā-mohaniya, the following verse describes in detail the four types of kṣayā-mohaniya, namely anantānubandhi, etc.

Jājīva-varisa-cau-mās-pakkha-gā nar-yatiri-nar-amara.
Sammāna-savirai-ahakha-ya-charitta-ghāyakarā. ||18||

**Gāthā-artha:** The time limit of the four types of kṣayās, namely anantānubandhi, etc., mentioned above, is respectively for life, one year, four months, and fifteen days (one pakṣa), and they are respectively the causes of bondage to hell, animal, human, and heavenly realms, and they respectively destroy samyaktva, deśavirati, sarvavirati, and yathāsyāt-charitra.

**Viśeṣārtha:** The verse mentions the time limit of the four types of kṣayā-mohaniya, namely anantānubandhi, etc., the realms to which they bind, and the qualities of the soul that are destroyed by them. Their specific explanation is as follows:

Anantānubandhi kṣayā remains for life, i.e., this kṣayā remains even for birth after birth. In its presence, the bondage of karmas worthy of hell takes place, and it is the destroyer of the quality of samyaktva in the soul.

The time limit of apratyākhyānāvaraṇa kṣayā is one year, and...

Page #162:
---------------------------
Karma Vipaka

Due to the rise of karma, the soul becomes bound to the state of sub-human existence (tiryancagati). As a result, the soul is unable to adopt the vow of partial renunciation (deshavirata - the vow of a Shravaka).

Pratyakhyana (Renunciation) Kashayas

The soul is unable to attain the vow of complete renunciation (sarvavirata - the vow of a Shramana) due to the rise of karmas suitable for the state of human existence. The duration of these Kashayas (passions) is four months.

Samjvalana Kashaya

The rise of this Kashaya binds the soul to karmas suitable for the state of divine existence, and the soul is unable to attain the state of right conduct (yathakhyata-charitra).

The duration and extent of the four types of Anantanubandhi Kashayas should be understood in the same way, based on the perspective of the conventional point of view (vyavahara-naya). This is because Bahubali and others had Samjvalana Kashaya for up to one year, while the Anantanubandhi Kashaya of King Prasannachandra lasted for only an instant.

Verse 16:
Krodha (Anger) is like water, renu (dust), prithvi (earth), and parvata-raji (mountain ranges).
Mana (Pride) is like the three-leafed plant, the hard rock, and the vast ocean.

Verse 20:
Maya (Deceit) is like the formless, the single-horned, the dense, and the root-like.
Lobha (Greed) is like the yellow, the mud, and the impure.

Page #163:
---------------------------
## First Karma Granth

The four types of karma should be understood as follows:

* **Mana:** Like a field of clay, wood, bone, and rock pillar.
* **Maya:** Like a deceitful scribe, cow urine, a sheep's horn, and the root of a water plant.
* **Lobha:** Like the color of Haridwar, the soot of a lamp, mud, and a chili pepper.

**Special Note:** These two verses explain the results of the soul, which are filled with the four types of karma: anger, pride, deceit, and greed, through examples. These examples respectively represent the symbols of the four types of karma: 

* **Sanjwalan:** Like a line drawn in water.
* **Pratyakhyanavaran:** Like a line drawn in dust.
* **Apratyakhyanavaran:** Like a line drawn in earth.
* **Anantanubandhi:** Like a crack in a mountain.

Similarly, one should connect the examples of the symbols of pride, deceit, and greed with Sanjwalan, etc. 

**Explanation:**

* **Sanjwalan Anger:** This anger is like a line drawn in water, which quickly disappears.
* **Pratyakhyanavaran Anger:** Like a line drawn in dust, which is filled by the wind after some time, this type of anger is calmed by some remedy.
* **Apratyakhyanavaran Anger:** Like a crack in dry earth, which is filled by water, this type of anger is calmed by some effort and exertion.

Page #164:
---------------------------
## Karmavipaka

**Anantanubandhi Krodha** - Just as a crack in a mountain caused by its splitting never heals, similarly this anger does not subside even with effort and income.

**64**

**Sanjwalan Man** - Like a cane that bends without effort, this type of man quickly abandons his insistence.

**Pratyakhyanavaran Man** - Just as dry wood can become soft with oil massage, similarly this type of man can be overcome with great effort and remedies.

**Apratyakhyanavaran Man** - Like bending a bone, which requires hard work, this type of man is difficult to overcome even with effort and remedies.

**Anantanubandhi Man** - Just as it is impossible to bend a stone pillar even with hard work, similarly this type of man cannot be overcome.

**Sanjwalan Maya** - The crookedness in a boss's bamboo stick straightens without effort, similarly this type of Maya easily disappears.

**Pratyakhyanavaran Maya** - Like the curved path of a bull that is being led, this type of Maya has crooked results. This crooked nature is difficult to overcome.

**Apratyakhyanavaran Maya** - The curvature in a sheep's horns can be overcome with hard work and many remedies. Similarly, this type of Maya, which has similar results, is called Apratyakhyanavaran Maya. This type of Maya can be overcome with great effort and remedies.

**Anantanubandhi Maya** - The curvature in the root of a bamboo - crookedness -

Page #165:
---------------------------
First Karma Granth

Just as it is not possible for a straight line to be curved, similarly, there are results of Maya that are eternally bound.
Sanjwalana Lobha - The results of this greed are like the color of turmeric, which easily fades.
Pratyakhyanavaran Lobha - The results of this greed are like the color of kohl, which fades with some effort.
Apratyakhyanavaran Lobha - The results of this greed are like the mud on a cart wheel, which are very difficult to remove.
Anantanubandhi Lobha - Just as the color of iron oxide cannot be removed by any means, similarly, the results of this type of greed do not fade even with effort.
Thus, after describing the types of Kshaya-mohaniya, the next two verses describe the types of No-Kshaya-mohaniya.
Jassuvaya Hoh Jie Has Rai Arai Sog Bhay Kuchcha | Sanimittamnna' Vart Ih Hasai-mohaniyaṃ || 21 || Purisiththitadubhayam Paksha Ahilaso Jabvsa Habadd Sou | Dhinaranpuveudoayo Phuphumatnagaradaha-samo || 22 ||

## Karmavipaka

The feelings of laughter, attraction, aversion, sorrow, fear, and disgust are to be understood as the nine divisions of Nokshayamohaniya, namely, laughter, attraction, aversion, sorrow, fear, disgust, Striveda, Purushaveda, and Napumsakaved. The name Striveda, Purushaveda, and Napumsakaved are given to the desires that arise from the respective genders, male, female, and neuter. The desires of these three vedas are like the fires of excrement, grass, and city respectively.

**Special Note:** These two verses describe the nine divisions of Nokshayamohaniya. Their names are:

(1) Hasya (Laughter)
(2) Rati (Attraction)
(3) Arati (Aversion)
(4) Shoka (Sorrow)
(5) Bhaya (Fear)
(6) Jugupsa (Disgust)
(7) Striveda (Desire for a woman)
(8) Purushaveda (Desire for a man)
(9) Napumsakaved (Desire for a neuter)

The word "Mohaniya Karma" should be added before these names. The characteristics of these nine divisions are as follows:

**Hasya (Laughter):** The karma that causes laughter due to reasons like seeing the antics of a clown or without any reason is called Hasya-Mohaniya Karma. In other words, the karma that produces laughter is called Hasya-Mohaniya Karma.

**Rati (Attraction):** The karma that causes attraction towards objects with or without reason is called Rati-Mohaniya Karma.

**Arati (Aversion):** The karma that causes aversion or dislike towards objects with or without reason is called Arati-Mohaniya Karma.

Page #167:
---------------------------
First Karma Grantha

Shoka (Grief) - The karma whose arising causes grief, whether with or without a reason, is called Shoka-mohaniya karma.

Bhaya (Fear) - The karma whose arising causes fear or apprehension, whether with or without a reason, is called Bhaya-mohaniya karma.
There are seven types of fear:
(1) Fear of this world, (2) Fear of the next world, (3) Fear of thieves and robbers, (4) Sudden fear (due to accidental occurrences), (5) Fear of calamities, (6) Fear of death, and (7) General fear.

Jugupsa (Disgust) - The karma whose arising causes disgust or aversion towards repulsive or loathsome objects, whether with or without a reason, is called Jugupsa-mohaniya karma.

Veda - The desire for sexual indulgence is called Veda. The specific external manifestation of the arising of the karma that fulfills this desire is called Dravya-veda, and the corresponding inner desire is called Bhava-veda. There are three types of Veda: Stri-veda, Purusa-veda, and Napumsaka-veda. Their characteristics and effects are as follows:
Stri-veda - The karma whose arising makes a woman desire to engage in sexual activity with a man.

Page #168:
---------------------------
Karma Vipaka

The desire for karmic fruition is called striveda. The emotions of its longing are like the smoldering fire of dung cakes. Karisha means dry cow dung, bricks, thorns, sifted, and small pots. Just as the fire in the bricks keeps increasing the more it is fanned, similarly, the desire of the woman increases with the touch and activities of the man.

Purushavedha - The arising of which causes the man to have the desire to engage in intimacy with the woman, is called purushavedha. The example given for the longing of this vedha is the fire in the grass. Just as the grass fire ignites quickly and is extinguished quickly, similarly, the man's desire for sexual union is quickly aroused and quickly subsides.

Napumsaka Vedha - The arising of which causes the desire in both the woman and the man to engage in intimacy, is called napumsaka vedha. The example given for the passion of this vedha is the fire in the city. Just as the fire in the city burns for many days and takes a long time to extinguish, similarly, the desire arising from the napumsaka vedha is not easily subsided, and satisfaction is not obtained even through sense indulgence. In this way, the nine types of nokaṣāya-mohanīya have been described.

## First Karma Text

The twelve natures of anger, etc., which are infinite in their consequences, are all-destructive, except for the fourfold of burning passions and the nine non-passions, in addition to the fourfold of character-obscuring. Thus, after describing the nature of character-obscuring karma, the nature, etc., of lifespan and name karma are described.

**Verse 23:**

**Meaning:** Lifespan karma is of four types, differentiated by the realms of gods, humans, animals, and hell beings, and its nature is like a shackle (fetter). Name karma is similar in nature to a painter, and it has forty-two, ninety-nine, one hundred and three, and sixty-six types.

**Explanation:** The verse describes the nature of lifespan and name karma, and the number of their sub-types. First, lifespan karma is described.

**Lifespan Karma:** The karma whose fruition causes a being to live in the realms of gods, humans, animals, and hell beings, and whose destruction causes the being to leave those realms, i.e., to die, is called lifespan karma.

The nature of lifespan karma is like a prison. Just as a criminal is imprisoned for a certain period of time according to his crime, and the criminal also desires to be released from it, but cannot leave without completing the term, he has to stay there for a fixed time. Similarly, due to lifespan karma, a being has to live for a fixed period of time.

1. **"The life and death of a being due to the presence or absence of karma is called lifespan karma."** - Tattvarthadhigama Sutra 1012

Page #170:
---------------------------
One has to stay in the realms of hell and the like until the karmic consequences are exhausted. Only when the bound lifespan is exhausted, does one get liberation from that particular body.

**Ayukarma** (Lifespan Karma): It does not bring happiness or sorrow to the being, but it determines the duration for which the being remains in a particular body. _Narkajivas_ (beings in hell) are extremely miserable in the hellish realm. They would prefer to die rather than live there, but due to the existence of _Ayukarma_, their desire is not fulfilled as long as the _Ayukarma_ to be experienced remains. Similarly, humans and gods who have access to worldly pleasures and have a strong desire to live, are forced to depart to the next world when their _Ayukarma_ is exhausted. In other words, due to the existence of _Ayukarma_, a being cannot abandon its realm and gross body before its predetermined time and dies when it is exhausted, meaning it cannot remain in that gross body after the time is up. There are two types of _Ayukarma_: _Apvartaaniya_ (modifiable) and _Anpavartaniiya_ (unmodifiable).

_Apvartaaniya_ lifespan: The lifespan that is reduced due to external causes is called _Apvartaaniya_ lifespan or _Apvartya_ lifespan. This means that experiencing a lifespan bound for fifty years or more in a moment due to external causes like drowning, weapon injury, poison consumption, etc., is the modification of lifespan. This lifespan is also called untimely death by the common people.

_Anpavartaniiya_ lifespan: The lifespan that cannot be reduced by any cause. It is experienced for the duration for which it is bound, and is called _Anpavartaniiya_ or _Anpavartya_ lifespan.

Those who are born in the realms of hell and gods, _Charma Shariri_ (those who are destined for liberation from that body), and the best of men, ...

## The Prapama Farmgranth

This text discusses the concept of lifespan in Jainism, specifically focusing on the difference between **anavartaaniya** (unbreakable) and **apvartaaniya** (breakable) lifespans.

**Anavartaaniya lifespan** is possessed by beings like **Tirthankaras**, **Chakravartis**, **Vasudevas**, **Baladevas**, and countless others who are born in the **Jivi-Devakuru**, **Uttarakuru**, and other realms. These beings have a fixed lifespan that cannot be shortened.

**Apvartaaniya lifespan** is possessed by the remaining humans and animals. Their lifespan is subject to change and can be shortened.

**The difference between these two types of lifespans depends on the intensity of karma.** The lifespan of a future birth is determined by the karma accumulated in the present life. If the karma is mild, the lifespan is loosely bound, and the lifespan can be shortened if the appropriate conditions arise. However, if the karma is intense, the lifespan is tightly bound, and it cannot be shortened even if the appropriate conditions arise.

**Intense karma leads to a tightly bound lifespan that cannot be shortened even by weapons, poison, or other means.** This lifespan will be completed in its entirety, regardless of external factors.

**Mild karma leads to a loosely bound lifespan that can be shortened by external factors like weapons, poison, or fire.** This is known as **apvartaana** or **akalamrityu** (premature death). The lifespan that is completed in its entirety is known as **anavartaana** or **kalamrityu** (natural death).

**Apvartaaniya lifespan is always accompanied by **sopkrama-upkrama** (the conditions that lead to premature death, such as weapons, poison, or fire).** These conditions are inevitable for beings with an apvartaaniya lifespan.

**Anavartaaniya lifespan is possessed by humans who live for countless years and are born in the 30 akarmabhumis, 56 antarvipas, and other realms.** However, **anavartaaniya lifespan is also possessed by animals who live for countless years and are found in the 2.5 dvipas outside the dvipa oceans.**

## Karmavipaka (Karmic Consequences)

It is destined to be experienced. However, there are two types of unchangeable lifespans: **Sopkrama** (with natural death) and **Nirupkrama** (with premature death). This means that in some lifespans, the causes for premature death are present, while in others they are not. However, even if the causes for premature death are present, the unchangeable lifespan does not end before its fixed time limit. In essence, beings with a **Sopkrama** lifespan will inevitably encounter some cause for premature death, such as a weapon, while those with a **Nirupkrama** lifespan will not die prematurely, no matter how strong the cause.

There are four types of **Ayukarma** (lifespan karma): **Devaayu** (divine lifespan), **Manushyaayu** (human lifespan), **Tiyanchaayu** (animal lifespan), and **Narakaayu** (hellish lifespan).

**Devaayu** is the lifespan that leads to rebirth in the realm of gods.
**Manushyaayu** is the lifespan that leads to rebirth as a human.
**Tiyanchaayu** is the lifespan that leads to rebirth as an animal.
**Narakaayu** is the lifespan that leads to rebirth in hell.

After explaining **Ayukarma**, we will now discuss the nature and types of **Kramaprapta Namakarma** (name karma).

1. a) **Neraiya tirikkaau manussaauं tahev ya. Deva uy nauttham tu aaukaam chavii.**
- Uttaraadhyayana, Chapter 33, Verse 12
b) **Prajnaapana pan 23, u 2.**
c) **Naarakarshagyonamanush bannani.**

## First Karma Granthya

Just as a painter creates various forms of good and bad, such as elephants, horses, lions, deer, humans, etc., similarly, **Namakarma** creates various forms of good and bad for the soul. Therefore, the painter is used as a metaphor for **Namakarma**. The characteristic of **Namakarma** is this:

**Namakarma** is the karma that, upon its fruition, causes the soul to attain hell, animal, human, and celestial realms, and experience various good and bad states. Or, the karma that causes the soul to experience motion, etc., various states, or the formation of body, etc., is called **Namakarma**.

There are forty-two, ninety-nine, one hundred and three, and sixty-four types of **Namakarma** due to **Apekṣābheda**.

Now, in the next two verses, the fourteen **Piḍaprakṛtis** and eight **Pracīnaprakṛtis** of **Namakarma** are mentioned.

**Gati, Jāti, Śarīra, Angopānga, Bandhana, Saṃghātanā, Saṃhanana, Saṃsthāna, Varṇa, Gandha, Rasa, Sparśa, Anupūrvī, and Vihāya** - these are the various states that cause the soul to experience different states. Just as a merchant, in his business, earns various profits and losses, similarly, **Namakarma** causes the soul to experience various states, both good and bad, in the world.

**Stāṇāṅga 2.4.105 Tīkā**

Page #174:
---------------------------
## Karmavipaka

There are 14 **Pindaprakritis** and 8 **Pratyekaprakritis** of **Namakarma**. The eight **Pratyekaprakritis** are: **Paraghat**, **Uchchvas**, **Atap**, **Udyot**, **Agurulghu**, **Tirthankar**, **Nirmaan**, and **Updhat**.

**Note:** The previous section hinted at the existence of 41 different types of **Namakarma** due to differences in their characteristics. This number arises from the way we choose to describe them, either briefly or in detail. Some of these types have further subdivisions, while others do not. Those with subdivisions are called **Pindaprakritis**, and those without are called **Pratyekaprakritis**.

These two verses list the names of the 14 **Pindaprakritis** and 8 **Pratyekaprakritis** to explain the 41 different types. Their names are as follows:

**Pindaprakritis:**

1. **Gati**
2. **Jati**
3. **Sharira**
4. **Angopang**
5. **Bandhan**
6. **Sanghatan**
7. **Sanhanan**
8. **Sansthan**
9. **Varn**
10. **Gandh**
11. **Ras**
12. **Sparsh**
13. **Anupurvi**
14. **Vihayogati**

**Pratyekaprakritis:**

1. **Paraghat**
2. **Uchchvas**
3. **Atap**
4. **Udyot**
5. **Agurulghu**
6. **Tirthankar**
7. **Nirmaan**
8. **Updhat**

All these are **Namakarma** **Prakritis**, so when pronouncing them, we should add the word "Namakarma" after each. For example, **Gatinamkarma**, **Jatinamkarma**, **Shariranamkarma**, etc.

**Definitions of Pindaprakritis:**

1. **(a)** **Prajnapanajaya 2, Pad 23, Sutra 263**
2. **(b)** **Samavayangasthan 42**

Page #175:

## First Karma Granth

**Gati:** The karma that causes the soul to be reborn in different realms like human, hell, animal, or god, is called **Mati Karma**.

**Jati:** The karma that causes the soul to acquire one, two, three, four, or five senses (touch, taste, etc.) and be called one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, or five-sensed, is called **Jati Karma**.

**Sharira:** The karma that causes the soul to acquire different types of bodies like Audarik, Vaikriya, etc., is called **Sharira Karma**.

**Angopang:** The karma that causes the soul to acquire different body parts like hands, feet, head, etc., and sub-parts like fingers, etc., is called **Angopang Karma**.

**Bandhan:** The karma that causes the soul to connect newly acquired particles with the previously acquired Audarik, etc., body particles, is called **Bandhan Karma**.

**Sanghat:** The karma that causes the newly acquired body particles to be arranged in a systematic way on the previously acquired body particles, is called **Sanghat Karma**.

**Sanhanan:** The karma that causes the joints in the body to become strong, is called **Sanhanan Karma**.

**Sansthan:** The karma that causes the body to acquire different auspicious or inauspicious shapes, is called **Sansthan Karma**.

**Varn:** The karma that causes the body to acquire different colors like black, brown, etc., is called **Varn Karma**.

## Karmavipaka

**Gandha** - The karma that results in the body having a pleasant or unpleasant odor is called Gandha karma.

**Rasa** - The karma that results in the body experiencing bitter, sweet, or other pleasant or unpleasant tastes is called Rasa karma.

**Sparsha** - The karma that results in the body having a rough, soft, smooth, or dry touch is called Sparsha karma.

**Anupurvi** - The karma that results in the soul returning to its place of origin in its next birth is called Anupurvi karma.

**Vihayogati** - The karma that results in the soul having a gait like that of an elephant, bull, etc. (pleasant) or like that of a camel, donkey, etc. (unpleasant) is called Vihayogati karma.

The details of the various sub-categories of these Pind-Prakritis will be mentioned in the following verses.

Out of the 28 categories of Namakarma, eight have been mentioned in this verse. Their characteristics will be explained in the following chapters.

Out of the 42 categories of Namakarma, 22 have been mentioned here. The remaining 20 categories will be mentioned in the next two verses.

**1. Vihayogati** - The word "Vihay" is used as a qualifier in Vihayogati.

This is to avoid repetition. If only the word "Gati" was used, it would have created repetition with the first category of Namakarma, which is also called "Gati". The word "Vihay" is used to clarify the meaning, which is "in the sense of".

The word "Gati" refers to the gait of the soul, not to the state of being a god or a human.

*Tras*, *badar*, *paryapt* *pratyek*, *sthira*, *shubha*, *subhaga*, *susvara*, *aadey* and *yashakoti* - these are the ten natures of the *Trasadashak*. And *sthavar*, *sukshma*, *aparyapt*, *sadharana*, *asthira*, *akshubha*, *dubhang*, *duhsvara*, *anaadey* and *ayashakoti* - these are the ten natures of the *Sthavaradashak*. By combining the ten natures of the *Sadashak* and *Sthavaradashak*, the beads of *namakarma* are formed.

**Vishesharth:**
Out of the twenty-eight names of each nature, the names of twenty natures, excluding eight, are mentioned in these two verses as *Sadashak* and *Sthavaradashak*. Since the names from *tras* to *yashakoti* are ten in number, they are called *Sadashak*. And since the names from *sthavar* to *ayashakoti* are also ten in number, they are called *Sthavaradashak*.

The ten names of the *Sadashak* natures are as follows:
(1) *Vasanam*, (2) *Badarnam*, (3) *Paryaptnam*, (4) *Pratyeknam*, (5) *Sthirnam*, (6) *Shubhnam*, (7) *Subhaganam*, (8) *Susvarnam*, (9) *Ayanam*, and (10) *Yashakotirnam*.

The ten names of the *Sthavaradashak* natures are:
(1) *Sthavarnam*, (2) *Sukshmanam*, (3) *Aparyaptnam*, (4) ...

**Common Names:** (5) Asthiranam, (6) Ashubhanam, (7) Durbhaganam, (8) Duhsvaranam, (6) Anadeyanam, and (10) Ayashah Kirtinam.

**68**

Out of these twenty types, the Sadashaka types are counted as punya (meritorious) types, and the Stavardashaka types are counted as papa (demeritorious) types. The characteristics of these types are explained further in the text. After mentioning the names of these forty-two types of name-karma, for the sake of brevity, the text uses two verses to describe these twenty types with some symbolic names (sanketas) like Trasa, etc.

Terms like "Chatushk", "Agurulachuchatushk", "Basadvik", "Satrik", "Sachatushk", "Asashatk" etc. are used (as synonyms). Similarly, other terms should be understood by counting the number of "Prakritis" (categories) and their names. 

**Special Note:** This concise method is used to avoid lengthy explanations and to help seekers understand the essence of the scriptures. Therefore, some terms are defined here in a simple way. "Sanket" (symbol), "Vibhasha" (synonym), and "Sanjna" (term) are synonymous.

These terms are formed by combining the names of "Prakritis" with numbers like two, three, four, etc. These terms represent the names of further "Prakritis" along with the name of the initial "Prakriti" to complete the number. Some of these terms are indicated in these two sections:

**Prasachatusk (4):** (1) Sanam, (2) Badarnam, (3) Paryaptanam, (4) Pratyeknam.

**Spirishadk (6):** (1) Sthirnam, (2) Shubhnam, (3) Subhaganam, (4) Susvarnam, (5) Adayanam, (6) Yash-Kirtinam.

**Asthirishadk (6):** (1) Asthirnam, (2) Ashubhnam, (3) Durbhaganam, (4) Duhsvarnam, (5) Anadayanam, (6) Ayash-Kirtinam.

In the 23rd gatha, it was said that there are 42, 63, 103, and 67 types of name-karma due to the difference in expectation. Of these, the names and symbols of the 42 types have been explained in brief. To explain the 93 types that arise from the difference in expectation, the number of Uttaraprakritis of the 14 Pindaprakritis are mentioned.

**I**

**Gathiyan U Kamso Chapanapanatipanapanch Chchchrakam. Pan Bugapan Thasajadug Uttarameyapanashatthi ||30||**

**Gathath** - The 14 Pindaprakritis of name-karma mentioned earlier have 4, 5, 5, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 5, 2, 5, 8, 4, and 2 types respectively. Adding all these types together, we get a total of 65 types. There are also 93 types of name-karma due to the difference in expectation, which are mentioned in the 24th gatha.

Page #181:
---------------------------
## First Karma Granth 101

The number of sub-divisions of the *prakritis* is mentioned in this verse. The verse does not mention the names of the *prakritis*, but only the number of their sub-divisions. Therefore, the numbers mentioned in this verse should be added to the names of the *prakritis* mentioned in the twenty-fourth verse, respectively.

There are 4 sub-divisions of *gatinam*, 5 sub-divisions of *jatinam*, 5 sub-divisions of *shariranam*, sub-divisions of *angopangnam*, 5 sub-divisions of *bandhanam*, 5 sub-divisions of *sanghatanam*, 6 sub-divisions of *sanhananam*, 6 sub-divisions of *sansthanam*, 5 sub-divisions of *varnanam*, 2 sub-divisions of *gandhanam*, 5 sub-divisions of *rasanam*, 8 sub-divisions of *sparshanam*, 4 sub-divisions of *anupurvinam*, and sub-divisions of *vihayogatinam*.

## 2

Thus, by combining the aforementioned sub-divisions of the fourteen *pindaprakritis* of *namakarma*, the total number of sub-divisions is 65.

Due to the existence of 13, 103, and 67 *prakritis* of *namakarma*, and the different numbers of *karmaprakritis* in relation to *bandha* etc., the following two verses clarify this:

## 31

Twenty-eight, three, and nine, or fifteen in *bandhana*.  

## 32

The *bandhana* aggregate, the subtle, and the seven, sixty-six in *bandha* origin, or not, according to the understanding.  

**Verse Meaning:**

By combining the aforementioned sub-divisions of the *pindaprakritis* of *namakarma*, there are twenty-eight *prakritis*. Adding fifteen sub-divisions of *bandhana* to these, there are one hundred and three sub-divisions. By taking into account the sub-divisions of *bandhana* and *sanghatanam* in the five bodies, and by taking into account the four *varna* from the general, one should understand sixty-six sub-divisions of *bandha*, *udaya*, and *udirana*. At the time of *bandha*...

Page #182:
---------------------------
## 102
**Karmavishak**

One should understand that there are 120, 122, and 148 natures respectively, in relation to bondage, arising, and existence, due to the absence of bondage from Samyaktva and mixed delusion. 

**Special Note:** How the 19th and subsequent divisions of Name Karma arise due to the difference in expectation and how many natures are eligible for bondage, etc., is explained in these two chapters.

In the previous verse, the 65 divisions of the 14 Pindaprakritis of Name Karma were mentioned. By adding the 10 natures each of Paramarth, etc., Karma, and the 10 natures of the immovable decad, there are 93 natures in existence. 

In these 63 natures, five divisions of bondage Name Karma are taken, but in detail, there are 15 divisions of bondage Name Karma. Therefore, by adding 15 divisions instead of five, one should understand that there are 103 natures in the existence of Name Karma.

However, in the bodies of Audarika, etc., there are Audarika, etc., forms of bondage and Audarika, etc., forms of aggregation. Therefore, by including the 15 divisions of bondage Name Karma and the five divisions of aggregation Name Karma, a total of 20 divisions, in the five divisions of body Name Karma, and by including the five, two, five, and eight divisions of color, smell, taste, and touch Name Karma respectively, in the four colors, the 16 natures of color, etc., and the 20 natures of bondage and aggregation (a total of 36 natures) are subtracted from the aforementioned 103 natures of Name Karma, resulting in 67 natures of Name Karma being considered from a relative perspective. 

These 67 natures of Name Karma are taken into account when calculating the natures eligible for bondage, arising, and existence.

Page #183:

## First Karma Granth 103

**Number of Bandha-Adi Yogya Prakṛtis**

There are 120 Bandha-Adhikāriṇī Prakṛtis, 122 Udaya and Udiranā-Adhikāriṇī Prakṛtis, and 158 or 148 Sattā-Adhikāriṇī Prakṛtis.

**Bandha-Adhikāriṇī Prakṛtis (120)**

These are: 5 for Jñānāvaraṇa, 6 for Darśanāvaraṇa, 2 for Vedaniya, 26 for Mohaniya, 4 for Āyu, 67 for Nāma, 2 for Gotra, and 5 for Antarāya. In total, these are 120 Prakṛtis.

**Mohaniya Kali (22)**

The reason for 22 Mohaniya Kali is that the original Bandha-Yogya Prakṛti is Mithyātva-Mohaniya. Samyaktva-Mohaniya and Miśra-Mohaniya do not bind. Because the Jīva, due to its Samyaktva Guna, purifies some of the Pudgalas bound by Mithyātva-Mohaniya and makes some semi-pure. These purified Pudgalas are called Samyaktva-Mohaniya, and the semi-pure Pudgalas are called Mith (Samyaktva-Mithyātva) Mohaniya. Therefore, out of the 28 Prakṛtis of Mohaniya Karma, subtracting the two Prakṛtis of Samyaktva-Mohaniya and Miśra-Mohaniya, 26 Prakṛtis are Bandha-Yogya, and 120 Prakṛtis are considered Bandha-Adhikāriṇī.

**Udaya and Udiranā Yogya Prakṛtis (122)**

There are 122 Udaya and Udiranā Yogya Prakṛtis. Because the two Prakṛtis of Samyaktva-Mohaniya and Miśra-Mohaniya, which were subtracted from the Bandha-Yogya Karma Prakṛtis, are added back, 122 Prakṛtis become Udaya and Udiranā Adhikāriṇī.

**Sattā Adhikāriṇī Prakṛtis (158 or 148)**

Sattā means existence. The eight Karmas, Jñānāvaraṇa etc., are generally...

Page #184:

## 104
## Karmavipaka

There are 158 types of karmavipaka, therefore 158 prakritis are considered to be the authority of existence to explain the existence of all of them.
The number of 158 karma prakritis that are the authority of existence is as follows: 5 for jnanaavaran, 7 for darshanavaran, 2 for vedaniya, 28 for mohaniya, 4 for ayu, 103 for namakarma, 2 for gotra and 5 for antaraya. The sum of all these is 158.

The reason for saying that there are 148 prakritis that are the authority of existence due to the difference in expectation is that if only 5 types of bandhana namakarma are taken instead of 15 types, then 10 types of bandhana will be reduced from 158, leaving 148 prakritis considered to be the authority of existence.

After stating the number of pindaprakritis of namakarma and the number of prakritis in bandhana etc., now in verses 33 to 51, the names, characteristics and characteristics of each prakriti of the types of pindaprakritis of namakarma are explained.

Niryatirinarasuragai igabiyatiy chaupanidijaiyo. Orala viupaharagateyakamman pan sarish ||33||

**Meaning of the verse:**

There are four types of gati namakarma: narakagati, tiyanchagati, manushya gati and devagati. There are five types of jati namakarma: ekendiriya, dwiindriya, triindriya, chaturindriya and panchendriya. There are five types of sharir namakarma: audarik, vaikriya, aharak, tejas and kaman.

**Special Meaning:**

The names and numbers of the fourteen pindaprakritis of namakarma have been mentioned earlier. According to that, in this verse, the names of the types of gati, jati and sharir namakarma are mentioned in order.

**Karma of Species (Jati-namakarma) and its Types:**

(1) **Ekaindriya Jati-namakarma:** The karma that, upon its fruition, causes a being to have only one sense organ - the sense of touch (body).

(2) **Dwindriya Jati-namakarma:** The karma that, upon its fruition, causes a being to have two sense organs - the sense of touch (body) and the sense of taste (tongue).

(3) **Triindriya Jati-namakarma:** The karma that, upon its fruition, causes a being to have three sense organs - the sense of touch (body), the sense of taste (tongue), and the sense of smell (nose).

(4) **Chaturindriya Jati-namakarma:** The karma that, upon its fruition, causes a being to have four sense organs - the sense of touch (body), the sense of taste (tongue), the sense of smell (nose), and the sense of sight (eyes).

(5) **Panchendriya Jati-namakarma:** The karma that, upon its fruition, causes a being to have five sense organs - the sense of touch (body), the sense of taste (tongue), the sense of smell (nose), the sense of sight (eyes), and the sense of hearing (ears).

**Explanation of Jati-namakarma:**

There are five senses: (1) Touch (body), (2) Taste (tongue), (3) Smell (nose), (4) Sight (eyes), and (5) Hearing (ears). Touch is the first sense, and hearing is the fifth. All beings in the cycle of birth and death have the sense of touch. The other senses develop gradually, leading to the five types of Jati-namakarma, from Ekaindriya to Panchendriya.

**Ekaindriya Jati-namakarma:** The karma that, upon its fruition, causes a being to have only one sense organ - the sense of touch (body).

(2) The karma that gives rise to two senses - body and tongue - in a being is called **Dwiindriya Jati Karma**.
(3) The karma that gives rise to three senses - body, tongue, and nose - in a being is called **Triindriya Jati Karma**.
(4) The karma that gives rise to four senses - body, tongue, nose, and eyes - in a being is called **Chaturindriya Jati Karma**.
(5) The karma that gives rise to all five senses - body, tongue, nose, eyes, and ears - in a being is called **Panchendriya Jati Karma**.

##  Characteristics of **Sharira Karma**
There are five types of **Sharira Karma**: (1) **Audarik Sharira Karma**, (2) **Vaikriya Sharira Karma**, (3) **Aharak Sharira Karma**, (4) **Taijas Sharira Karma**, and (5) **Karman Sharira Karma**. Their characteristics are as follows:

(1) The karma that gives rise to an **Audarik Sharira** is called **Audarik Sharira Karma**. **Udara** means primary or gross particles. A body made of these particles, containing bones, flesh, blood, etc., is called an **Audarik Sharira**.
The bodies of Tirthankaras and Ganadharas are made of primary particles, while the bodies of ordinary beings are made of gross, impure particles. This **Audarik Sharira** is present in all humans and animals, whether they are born from the womb or from **Samucchema** birth.

(2) The karma that gives rise to a **Vaikriya Sharira** in a being is called **Vaikriya Sharira Karma**. A body that has the power to create various forms, big and small, single and multiple, diverse and strange, is called a **Vaikriya Sharira**.

Page #187:
---------------------------
## First Karma Granth, Chapter 107

**4.** There are two types of Vaikriya bodies:

* **Aupapatik:** This type of Vaikriya body is obtained by Devas and Narakas, meaning they receive this body upon birth in those realms.
* **Labdhipratyaya:** This type of Vaikriya body is obtained by humans and animals (Tiryach). They acquire this body through specific powers gained through practices like penance (Tap).

**(3)** The Karma that gives rise to the **Aharaksharira** is a type of **Namakarma**. This body is obtained by the fourteen **Purvadhari** Muniraj in the **Mahavideha** (other realms) due to their special abilities, such as **Riddhi** (miraculous powers), **Sanshaya-nivarana** (removing doubts), etc. This body is extremely pure, like a crystal, and is free from any obstacles. It is not hindered by anything and does not hinder anything else. This body is only obtained by humans, and even then, only by the fourteen **Purvadhari** Muniraj. 

When a **Chaturdasha Purvadhari** Muni has a doubt about something and the **Sarvagya** (omniscient being) is not present, they create a **Aharaksharira** using their special abilities. This body is made of **Shubh** (auspicious) **Pudgalas** and is extremely subtle, making it free from obstacles. With this body, they travel to the other realm where the **Sarvagya** resides, clear their doubts, and then return to their own realm. This entire process happens within a moment.

**(4)** The Karma that gives rise to the **Tejas Sharira** is called **Tejas Namakarma**. 
The **Tejas Sharira** is obtained by the Jiva and is made of **Tejas Pudgalas**.

Page #188:
---------------------------
##  Translation:

100. The body that digests the results of karma and is the cause of Tejo-leshya is called the Tejas-sharira. Just like Tejo-leshya, the cause of Sheeta-leshya is also this Tejas-sharira. One should understand that any ascetic who harms others through Tejo-leshya due to anger and benefits others through Sheeta-leshya due to happiness, does so due to the influence of this Tejas-sharira.

5) The karma that results in the attainment of the Karman-sharira is called Karman-sharira-karma. The body formed by the karma of Jnana-avaran, etc., is called the Karman-sharira. Due to this body, the Jiva keeps revolving in the cycle of birth and death in the world in the form of Naraka, etc.

The Tejas and Karman-sharira are present in all worldly beings and have an eternal connection with the soul. These two bodies do not face any resistance in the world, meaning even a hard object like a thunderbolt cannot stop them from entering. This is because they are extremely subtle, and subtle things can enter everywhere without obstruction, like fire in a piece of iron. _ A worldly being can have a minimum of two and a maximum of four bodies at a time. There are never five. When there are two, it is Tejas and Karman, because these two are present in all worldly beings. This situation is found in the interval of movement during the transition from one body to another in the state of Vigraha-gati. Because at that time, no other body exists. When there are three, it is Tejas, Karman, and Audarik or Tejas, Karman, and Vaikriya. The first type is found in humans and animals from birth to death, and the second type is found in Devas and Narakas. When there are four, it is Tejas, Karman, Audarik, and Vaikriya or Tejas,

Page #189:
---------------------------
## First Karma Granth, Chapter 106: Ahar Karma

**Ahar Karma** is found in both humans and animals during the time of **Bankiya Labdhi** (acquisition of wealth). The second option, **Ahar Kalabdhi** (acquisition of food), is possible for **Chaturdasha Purva Dhari Munis** (monks who have completed 14 stages of spiritual development). However, **Vaniya Labdhi** and **Ahar Kalabdhi** cannot be used simultaneously, so no one can have all five bodies at the same time.

Now, we will explain the different types of **Angopang Napakarma** (karma related to body parts) in order: **Bahru, Pitti, Sir, Ur, Uyarang, Uvang, Anguli, and Maha**. 

**Gatha 34:** "Two hands, two feet, one back, one head, one chest, and one stomach - these are the eight **Angas** (major body parts). **Upangas** (minor body parts) are small parts attached to the **Angas**, such as fingers, etc. The remaining parts are called **Angopangas**."

These **Angas**, **Upangas**, and **Angopangas** are present only in the first three bodies (**Audarik**, **Ahar**, and **Vaniya**). The **Angopang Napakarma** is a type of **Vishesharth Napakarma** (karma related to specific characteristics) and is explained in the **Gatha**.

The term **Angopang** encompasses **Angas**, **Upangas**, and **Angopangas**. There are eight types of **Angas**: (1-2) two hands, (3-4) two feet, (5) one back, (6) one head, (7) one chest, and (8) one stomach. Small parts attached to the **Angas**, such as fingers, nose, ears, etc., are called **Upangas**. The lines and joints of the fingers are called **Angopangas**.

## Karmavipaka

Angadi (limbs) require a form, and this form is found in the first three bodies - Audarik, Vaikriya, and Aharak. Therefore, Angadi are present only in these three bodies. However, the Taijas and Karmag bodies do not have any form or structure, so they do not have Angadi.

There are three types of Angopaang Karma: Audarik-Angopaang, Vaikriya-Angopaang, and Aharak-Angopaang. Their characteristics are as follows:

1. **Audarik-Angopaang Karma:** The karma that, upon its fruition, transforms Audarik body-form Pudgalas into Angopaang-form limbs.
2. **Vaikriya-Angopaang Karma:** The karma that, upon its fruition, transforms Vaikriya body-form Pudgalas into Angopaang-form limbs.
3. **Aharak-Angopaang Karma:** The karma that, upon its fruition, transforms Aharak body-form Pudgalas into Angopaang-form limbs.

In their respective body-forms, Pudgalas form their corresponding Angopaang. Now, in the next verse, we will discuss the types of Bandhan Karma.

**Verse 35:**

**Uralai-Puggalanam Nibaddha-Baajantayan Sambandha.**
**Jan Kunai Jausaman Tan' Uralai-Bandhanan Neyam.**

**Meaning:** The karma that binds together the Pudgalas of the Audarik, Vaikriya, and Aharak bodies, like a red thread, is called Uralai-Bandhan Karma.

**Alternative Reading:**

**Inghanam Uralai Tanuna Ma:**

Page #191:
---------------------------
## First Karma Text

- Know that karma which binds together, as **Ādārika** etc., by the name of **Bandhana Karma**.
111

**Special Meaning:** Just as things are joined together by means of sticky substances like lac-gum, etc., in the same way, **Bandhana Karma**, by the force of **Śarīra Karma**, binds together the **Pudgalas** of the **Audārika** bodies previously taken and being taken in the present. If **Bandhana Karma** were not present, there would be the same instability in the **Pudgalas** transformed into the form of the body as there is in the particles of roasted barley flour flying in the wind. **Bandhana** is of two types: **Sarva-Bandha** at the beginning of the bodies arising from all **Peshī**, and **Deśa-Bandha** later, as long as those bodies are held. That is, **Deśa-Bandha** occurs as long as the bodies remain, not when they are newly generated.

**Audārika**, **Vaikriya**, and **Āhārika** bodies experience **Sarva-Bandha** at the time of their origin and **Deśa-Bandha** later. However, the **Tejas** and **Kārma** bodies are always present in worldly beings, they are not newly generated, therefore they experience **Deśa-Bandha**.

There are five types of **Bandhana Karma** (1) **Audārika Śarīra Bandhana** (2) **Vaikriya Śarīra Bandhana** (3) **Āhārika Śarīra Bandhana** (4) **Tejas Śarīra Bandhana** (5) **Kārma Śarīra Bandhana**. Their characteristics are as follows:

(1) The karma whose arising causes the **Pudgalas** of the previously taken **Audārika** body to merge with the **Pudgalas** of the **Audārika** body being taken in the present, is called **Audārika Śarīra Bandhana Karma**.

Page #192:
---------------------------
## 112
**Karmavipaka 12)** The karma whose arising causes the merging of the acquired **vaikriya-sharira** pudgalas with the previously acquired **vaikriya-sharira** pudgalas is called **vaikriya-sharira-bandhana** karma.
(3) The karma whose arising causes the merging of the acquired **aaharaka-sharira** pudgalas with the previously acquired **aaharaka-sharira** pudgalas is called **aaharaka-sharira-bandhana** karma.
(4) The karma whose arising causes the merging of the acquired **taijas-sharira** pudgalas with the previously acquired **taijas-sharira** pudgalas is called **taijas-sharira-bandhana** karma.
(5) The karma whose arising causes the merging of the acquired **karman-sharira** pudgalas with the previously acquired **karman-sharira** pudgalas is called **karman-sharira-bandhana** karma.

There are fifteen types of **bandhana** karma, differentiated by their objects. Their names and causes are explained in verse 37. Now, the types of **sanghatan** karma are being explained.

**Verse 36:**
**Jān sanghayai uralai puggale tanaganam va dantaalo.
Tan sanghay bandhanam iva tanunamen panchaviham.**

**Meaning:** Just as a bundle of grass is gathered together by a tooth-like object, similarly, the karma that gathers together the **audarika** etc. body pudgalas is called **sanghatan** karma. Like **bandhana** karma, it also has five types, differentiated by the five bodies, **audarika** etc.

**Explanation:** **Sanghatan** means proximity, closeness. The merging of the previously acquired and acquired body pudgalas is possible only...

Page #193:
---------------------------
## First Karma Granth 113

It is only when the **grahit** and **gahaman** **pudgalas** are in close proximity to each other, that **bananan** is possible. Therefore, bringing together the **pudgalas** suitable for the body, establishing them close to each other in an organized manner, where they achieve uniformity through the non-entry of their respective regions, is the work of the **sanghatan** **namakarma**.

Just as scattered grass is gathered together by a rake, forming a bundle, similarly, the **sanghatan** **namakarma** brings together the **pudgalas** suitable for the body, and the **bandhan** **namakarma** connects them to their respective bodies.

Just as there are five types of **bandhan** **namakarma** based on the names of the five bodies, **audarik** etc., similarly, there are also five types of **sanghatan** **namakarma**:

1. **Audarik-sanghatan** **namakarma**
2. **Vaishya-sanghatan** **namakarma**
3. **Aharak-sanghatan** **namakarma**
4. **Tejas-sanghatan** **namakarma**
5. **Karman-sanghatan** **namakarma**

Their characteristics are as follows:

1. The **namakarma** whose emergence brings about the close proximity of **pudgalas** transformed into the **audarik** body is called **audarik-sanghatan** **namakarma**.
2. The **namakarma** whose emergence brings about the close proximity of **pudgalas** transformed into the **vaishya** body is called **vaishya-sanghatan** **namakarma**.
3. The **namakarma** whose emergence brings about the close proximity of **pudgalas** transformed into the **aharak** body is called **aharak-sanghatan** **namakarma**.
4. The **namakarma** whose emergence brings about the close proximity of **pudgalas** transformed into the **tejas** body is called **tejas-sanghatan** **namakarma**.

Page #194:
---------------------------
## 114
## Karma-Vipaka
(5) The name "Karman-Sanghatanam" is given to the mutual proximity of the pudgalas transformed into the karman-body due to the arising of karma.

While explaining the five types of Bandhan-karma, it was mentioned that it also has fifteen types. Therefore, we will now explain how these fifteen types are formed and what their names are.

**Gatha-arth:** The combination of the Audarik, Vaikriya, and Aharak bodies with their own named bodies and the Tejas and Karman bodies results in nine types of Bandhan-karma. The combination of Tejas and Karman with these bodies, taken together, results in three more types. And the combination of Tejas and Karman with their own named bodies and others results in three more types. Combining these types results in fifteen types of Bandhan-karma.

**Visheshary:** The names of the original five types of Bandhan-karma have been mentioned earlier. However, this Gatha explains the names of the fifteen types of Bandhan-karma that are formed from a perspective of expectation, and how they are formed. The combination of the Audarik, Vaikriya, and Aharak bodies with the pudgalas of their own named bodies results in three types. For example, Audarik-Audarik, etc. The combination of these Audarik, Vaikriya, and Aharak bodies with the Tejas body results in three more types. For example, Audarik-Tejas, etc. Similarly, the combination of each of these three bodies (Audarik, etc.) with the pudgalas of the Karman body results in three types: Audarik-Karman, etc.

Page #195:
---------------------------
## First Karma Granth, Chapter 115

Thus, by combining the *pudgalas* of the original body with each of the three bodies, *audarik*, *vaikriya*, and *aaharaka*, and by combining each of these with the *taijasa* body *pudgalas*, and by combining each of these with the *karman* body *pudgalas*, nine distinctions arise from combining the three parts of each.

From the *audarik*, *vaikriya*, and *aaharaka* bodies, three distinctions arise from the simultaneous combination of each with the *taijasa-karman* body *pudgalas*, such as *audarik-taijasa-karman*, etc. And from the *taijasa* and *karman* bodies, three more distinctions arise from the combination of each with its own and the other body's *pudgalas*, such as *taijasa-taijasa-bandhana*, *taijasa-karman-bandhana*, and *karman-karman-bandhana*.

Thus, by combining the aforementioned nine, three, and three, a total of fifteen distinctions of *bandhana-nama-karma* arise. Their names are as follows:

1. *Audarik-audarik-bandhana-nama*
2. *Audarik-taijasa-bandhana-nama*
3. *Audarik-karman-bandhana-nama*
4. *Vaikriya-vaikriya-bandhana-nama*
5. *Vaikriya-taijasa-bandhana-nama*
6. *Vaikriya-karman-bandhana-nama*
7. *Aaharaka-aaharaka-bandhana-nama*
8. *Aaharaka-taijasa-bandhana-nama*
9. *Aaharaka-karman-bandhana-nama*
10. *Audarik-taijasa-karman-bandhana-nama*
11. *Vaikriya-taijasa-karman-bandhana-nama*
12. *Aaharaka-taijasa-karman-bandhana-nama*
13. *Taijasa-taijasa-bandhana-nama*
14. *Taijasa-karman-bandhana-nama*
15. *Karman-karman-bandhana-nama*

Their meaning is that...

---

1. **Another way to count the fifteen distinctions of *bandhana-nama-karma***:

Distinctions arising from combination with the original body:

* *Audarik* and *Vaikriya* - *Vaikriya*
* *Aaharaka* and *Aaharaka*
* *Taijasa* - *Taijasa*
* *Karman* - *Karman*

Page #196:
---------------------------
## Karmavipaka

The karma whose arising causes a connection between the previously acquired Audārika body particles and the acquired Audārika particles is called Audārika-Audārika Bandhana Karma.

The karma whose arising causes a connection between the Audārika body particles and the Taijasa particles is called Audārika-Taijasa Bandhana Karma.

The karma whose arising causes a connection between the Audārika body particles and the Kārmaṇa particles is called Audārika-Kārmaṇa Bandhana Karma.

Similarly, the meaning of Vaikriya-Vaikriya Bandhana Karma and all other karmas should be understood.

The particles of the Audārika, Vaikriya, and Āhāraka bodies do not connect with each other. That is, only the particles of the Audārika body can connect with the Audārika body; not with the Vaikriya or Āhāraka body particles. Similarly, this should be understood for the Vaikriya and Āhāraka bodies. Since these are mutually contradictory in nature, there are no karmas that cause their connection.

Now, we will explain the types of Samhanana Karma.

The types of Samhanana Karma that arise from connection with the Taijasa body are: Bhaṅga-Audārika-Taijasa, Bhaṅga-Vaikriya-Taijasa, and Bhaṅga-Āhāraka-Taijasa.

The types of Samhanana Karma that arise from connection with the Kārmaṇa body are: Bhaṅga-Audārika-Kārmaṇa, Bhaṅga-Vaikriya-Kārmaṇa, Bhaṅga-Āhāraka-Kārmaṇa, and Bhaṅga-Taijasa-Kārmaṇa.

The types of Samhanana Karma that arise from simultaneous connection with the Taijasa and Kārmaṇa bodies are: Bhaṅga-Audārika-Taijasa-Kārmaṇa, Bhaṅga-Vaikriya-Taijasa-Kārmaṇa, and Bhaṅga-Āhāraka-Taijasa-Kārmaṇa. [To say the full name, add Bandhana Karma to each.]

## First Karma Text
### Chapter 117

**"The six types of Sanhanan are Vajra-Rishabha-Narach, Rishabha-Narach, Narach, Ardha-Narach, Keelika, and Chevatta. In these, Rishabha means patta-veshtan (bandage), Vajra means keel (nail), and Narach means Markatbandh on both sides."**

**Explanation:**

The term Sanhanan refers to the specific process of bone formation and joining. It is a type of Namakarma (karma related to name and form) that occurs in the Audarik (physical) body. 

The six types of Sanhanan are:

1. **Vajra-Rishabha-Narach:** This type involves two bones bound together by a Markatbandh on both sides, with a third bone wrapped around them like a bandage.
2. **Rishabha-Narach:** This type involves two bones bound together by a Markatbandh on both sides, but without the third bone wrapping around them.
3. **Narach:** This type involves two bones bound together by a Markatbandh on both sides, but without any wrapping.
4. **Ardha-Narach:** This type involves two bones bound together by a Markatbandh on only one side.
5. **Keelika:** This type involves a single bone being fixed in place by a nail.
6. **Chevatta:** This type involves a single bone being fixed in place by a bandage.

These six types of Sanhanan are responsible for the various ways in which bones are joined together in the Audarik body.

Page #198:
---------------------------
##  Translation:

**118**

The bone with a nail attached to it is called **Vana-Rishabhanarach**. The karma that causes such a specific formation of bones is called **Vajra-Rishabhanarach-Sahanan-Karma**.

**(2)** The karma that causes the specific formation of bones with a **Morkatbandh** on both sides and a **Vethan** of the third bone, but without a nail piercing all three, is called **Rishabhanarach-Sahanan-Karma**.

**(3)** The karma that causes the formation of bones with a **Morkatbandh** on both sides, but without a **Vethan** or a nail, is called **Narach-Sahanan-Karma**.

**(4)** The karma that causes the formation of bones with a **Morkatbandh** on one side and a nail on the other is called **Ardha-Narach-Sahanan-Karma**.

**(5)** The karma that causes the formation of bones without a **Morkatbandh** or a **Vethan**, but with the bones joined by a nail, is called **Kilika-Sahanan-Karma**.

**(6)** The karma that causes the formation of bones without a **Morkatbandh**, **Vethan**, or a nail, but with the bones joined together, is called **Chevatta-Sahanan-Karma**. **Chevatta** is also called **Sevat** or **Chhedavritta**.

Now we will describe the differences in **Sansthan** and **Varna** karma.

**Samachaurans, Nygrodha, Sadi, Kubja, Vaman, and...**

Page #199:
---------------------------
## First Karma Granth

**Huṇḍa-ye** is the name of the **saṁsthāna-karma**, and **kṛṣṇa, nīla, lohita, hāridra, pauta, and praveta** are the divisions of **varṇa-karma**.

**Special Note:** The verses mention the divisions of **saṁsthāna-karma** and **varṇa-karma**. This section first explains the divisions of **saṁsthāna-karma** and then the divisions of **varṇa-karma**.

The shape of the body is called **saṁsthāna**. The karma that gives rise to **saṁsthāna** is called **saṁsthāna-karma**. The different physical characteristics and variations in shapes seen in humans and other beings are due to **saṁsthāna-karma**. The six divisions of **saṁsthāna-karma** are:

(1) **Samacaturasra-saṁsthāna-karma**, (2) **Nyagrodha-parimaṇḍala-saṁsthāna-karma**, (3) **Sāḍi-saṁsthāna-karma**, (4) **Kubja-saṁsthāna-karma**, (5) **Vāmana-saṁsthāna-karma**, and (6) **Huṇḍa-saṁsthāna-karma**.

Their characteristics are as follows:

(1) **Samacaturasra** is derived from the three words **sama**, **catuḥ**, and **asra**. **Sama** means equal, **catuḥ** means four, and **asra** means angle. Therefore, **samacaturasra** refers to a body where all four angles are equal when sitting in a cross-legged position. This means the distance between the seat and the head, the distance between both knees, the distance between the right shoulder and left knee, and the distance between the left shoulder and right knee are all equal. The karma that gives rise to such a **saṁsthāna**, or according to the **Sāmudrika Śāstra**, a body with all auspicious features, is called **samacaturasra-saṁsthāna-karma**. 

(1) See the appendix for illustrations of **saṁhanana** and **saṁsthāna**.

Page #200:

## 120
## Karmavipaka
(2) The karma whose arising results in a body shape resembling a Nyagrodha (Banyan tree), i.e., the body parts above the navel are full and thick, and the parts below the navel are thin and weak, is called Nyagrodha-Parimandala-Sansthananama Karma.
(3) The karma whose arising results in the body parts above the navel being thin and weak, and the parts below the navel being full and thick, is called Sadi-Sansthananama Karma. The shape of the body parts in this Sansthan is like hair, opposite to Nyagrodha-Parimandala-Sansthan.
(4) The karma whose arising results in a hunchback body is called Karan-Sansthananama Karma.
(5) The karma whose arising results in a dwarf body is called Vamanasansthananama Karma.
(6) The karma whose arising results in all body parts being disproportionate and not of the appropriate size is called Hund-Sansthananama Karma.

After describing the types of Sansthananama Karma, we will explain the types and characteristics of Varna Karma.

The arising of Varna Karma results in the body having Krishna, Gaur, etc., colors. There are five types of Varna Karma:
(1) Krishna, (2) Neel, (3) Lohit, (4) Haridra, and (5) Sit. Their characteristics are:
(1) The karma whose arising results in the body of the being being coal-black is called Krishnavarna Karma.
(2) The karma whose arising results in the body of the being being green like a parrot's feather is called Neelvarna Karma.

Page #201:
---------------------------
## First Karma Text

(3) The karma whose arising causes the living being's body to be red like vermillion is called **Lohithavarna Karma**.

(4) The karma whose arising causes the living being's body to be yellow like turmeric is called **Haridravana Karma**.

(5) The karma whose arising causes the living being's body to be white like a conch shell is called **Sitavarna Karma**.

Now, in the following verse, we will explain the different types of **Gandha**, **Rasa**, and **Sparsha** Karmas.

**Verse 41:**

**Translation:**  There are two types of **Gandha Karma**: **Surabhi-Sugandha** (pleasant fragrance) and **Durabhi-Durgandha** (unpleasant fragrance). There are five types of **Rasa Karma**: **Tikta** (bitter), **Katu** (pungent), **Kashaya** (astringent), **Amla** (sour), and **Madhura** (sweet). There are eight types of **Sparsha Karma**: **Guru** (heavy), **Layu** (light), **Mrdu** (soft), **Khara** (rough), **Sheet** (cold), **Ushna** (hot), **Snigdha** (unctuous), and **Rukha** (dry).

**Explanation:** After explaining the five types of **Varna Karma**, we now explain the remaining **Gandha**, **Rasa**, and **Sparsha** Karmas, along with their characteristics.

**Gandha Karma** has two types: (1) **Surabhi Gandha Karma**, (2) **Durabhi Gandha Karma**.

(1) The karma whose arising causes the living being's body to have a fragrance like camphor, musk, etc., is called **Surabhi Gandha Karma**.

The bodies of Tirthankaras, etc., are fragrant.

(2) The karma whose arising causes the living being's body to have a smell like garlic, rotten things, etc., is called **Durabhi Gandha Karma**.

Page #202:
---------------------------
## 122

There are five types of Karmavipak Rasa Karma and their characteristics are as follows: (1) Tiktarasa, (2) Katurasa, (3) Kshayarasa, (4) Amla Rasa, (5) Madhura Rasa.

(1) The Karma whose fruition makes the body-fluid of the Jiva taste like ginger or black pepper is called Tiktarasa Karma.

(2) The Karma whose fruition makes the body-fluid of the Jiva taste like Chirayata or Neem is called Katurasa Karma.

(3) The Karma whose fruition makes the body-fluid of the Jiva taste like Amla or Baheda is called Kshayarasa Karma.

(4) The Karma whose fruition makes the body-fluid of the Jiva taste like lemon or tamarind is called Amla Rasa Karma.

(5) The Karma whose fruition makes the body-fluid of the Jiva taste like Mishri or other sweet substances is called Madhura Rasa Karma.

There are eight types of Sparsha Karma and their characteristics are as follows: (1) Guru, (2) Laghu, (3) Mridu, (4) Khara, (5) Sheet, (6) Ushna, (7) Snigdha, and (8) Rooksha. Each should be combined with the word Sparsha Karma.

(1) The Karma whose fruition makes the body of the Jiva feel heavy like iron is called Guru Sparsha Karma.

(2) The Karma whose fruition makes the body of the Jiva feel light like cotton is called Laghu Sparsha Karma.

(3) The Karma whose fruition makes the body of the Jiva feel soft like butter is called Mridu Sparsha Karma.

(4) The karma whose fruition makes the body of the living being rough and harsh like the tongue of a cow is called *Kharsparsha karma*. It is also called *Karkasha Sparsha karma*.
(5) The karma whose fruition makes the body of the living being cold like ice is called *Sheetsparsha karma*.
(6) The karma whose fruition makes the body of the living being hot like fire is called *Ushnasparsha karma*.
(7) The karma whose fruition makes the body of the living being smooth like ghee is called *Snigdhasparsha karma*.
(8) The karma whose fruition makes the body of the living being rough like sand is called *Rukhasparsha karma*.
Now, in the next verse, we will classify these twenty divisions of the *Varga Chatushk* into two categories, auspicious and inauspicious, and mention their names.
*Neelam Kasinam Dugandham Tis Kaduyam Guru Kharam Ruktum. Seerya Cha Asunavam Im Ikarsagam Shubham Se.* ||42||
Meaning of the verse - Out of the aforementioned twenty types of *Varna Chatushk*, *Neel*, *Krishna*, *Durgandha*, *Tikta*, *Katu*, *Guru*, *Karkasha*, *Rukha*, and *Shota* are nine inauspicious types, and the remaining eleven types are auspicious.
Special meaning - The names of the auspicious and inauspicious types of *Varna*, *Gandha*, *Rasa*, and *Sparsha* karma are as follows:
Inauspicious *Varna karma* - *Krishnavarna*, *Neelvarna*.
Inauspicious *Gandha karma* - *Durabhigandha* ( *Durgandha* ).
Inauspicious *Rasa karma* - *Tiktarasa*, *Katurasa*.

By combining the above two colors, one smell, two tastes, and four touches, one should understand the nine inauspicious natures of the four colors. The remaining eleven auspicious natures, their number and names are as follows:
**Shubha Varṇanāmakarma** - Sitavarṇa, Pītavarṇa, Lohitavarṇa.
**Shubha Gandhanāmakarma** - Surabhigandha (Sugandha).
**Shubha Rasānāmakarma** - Kaṣāyarasa, Āmlarasa, Madhura rasa.
**Shubha Sparśanāmakarma** - Laghuśparśa, Mudusparśa, Snigdhaśparśa, Uṣṇaśparśa. Now, in the next verse, the divisions of Ānūpūrvī Nāmakarma, the terms like Narakadvik, etc., and the divisions of Vihāyogati Nāmakarma are explained.

**Uh Gahavvṇuputri Gaivyigam Tigam Niyāujuyam. Puthvīudo Bakke Suhaasuha Vasudd Vihagagai ||43||**
**Verse Meaning:** - Just as there are four divisions of Gati Nāmakarma, there are also four divisions of Ānūpūrvī Nāmakarma. The rise of Ānūpūrvī Nāmakarma occurs in the Vi-graha-gati. By combining Gati and Ānūpūrvī, the terms Gati-drik are formed. By adding Āyu to this Drik, the term Gati-trik is formed. Just like the pace of a bull and a camel, there are two divisions of Vihāyogati Nāmakarma based on the difference between auspicious and inauspicious.

**Special Meaning:** - In this verse, the divisions of Ānūpūrvī and Vihāyogati, which are among the eight natures of Nāmakarma, and the terms like Narakadvik, etc., formed from the divisions of Nāmakarma, are explained. The divisions and nature of Ānūpūrvī Nāmakarma are as follows:

## First Karma Granth

(1) Devanupurvi,
(3) Tiryanchanupurvi
(2) Manushyanupurvi,
and
(4) Narakanupurvi.

The Karma which, by its arising, causes a living being in the state of Vigraha-Gati to travel through the series of celestial regions and reach its destination, is called Anupurvi Karma.

125.

The power to move is present in both the Jiva and the Pudgala. Therefore, both participate in the movement, being the cause. But here, the focus is mainly on the movement of the Jiva.

The natural movement of the Jiva is according to the series. The line of celestial regions is called a series. This movement of the Jiva is of two types - Riju and Vakra. In Riju-Gati, the Jiva does not need to make any new effort while transferring, because when it leaves its previous body, it receives the velocity generated by the previous body, and with that velocity, without any new effort, like an arrow released from a bow, it reaches its new location directly. The other movement is Vakra, which is curved. Therefore, while moving with this movement, the Jiva needs a new effort. Because the effort generated by the previous body works only up to the point where the Jiva needs to turn. In both these types of movements, the movement of a liberated Jiva is only Riju-Gati, and the movement of a worldly Jiva is both Riju and Vakra.

When the worldly Jiva moves to take on a body in another existence after leaving the body of this existence, that is, when the Jiva in the state of Vigraha-Gati moves, then according to the series of celestial regions...

## Karmavipaka and its Influence on Rebirth

A being reaches its destination of rebirth based on its **karmavipaka**. This process is influenced by **anupurvi** **namakarma**, which acts as a cause. **Anupurvi** **namakarma** pushes a being from its **samashreni** (higher) birth place to a **vishreni** (lower) birth place. If a being's birth place is already in **samashreni**, **anupurvi** **namakarma** does not arise. **Anupurvi** **namakarma** arises in **vakragati** (curved path) but not in **rijugati** (straight path).

The terms **gati-dvik**, **gati-trik**, etc., are used in this context. **Gati-dvik** indicates the presence of two elements: **gati** (path) and **anupurvi** **namakarma**. **Gati-trik** indicates the presence of three elements: **gati**, **anupurvi** **namakarma**, and **ayu** (lifespan).

For example, **narak-dvik** refers to **narak-gati** (path to hell) and **narak-anupurvi** (karma leading to hell). **Narak-trik** refers to **narak-gati**, **narak-anupurvi**, and **narak-ayu** (lifespan in hell). Similarly, **tiryanch-dvik**, **tiryanch-trik**, **manushya-dvik**, **manushya-trik**, **dev-dvik**, and **dev-trik** can be understood in the same way.

**Dvik** refers to the combination of **gati** and **anupurvi** **namakarma**, while **trik** refers to the combination of **gati**, **anupurvi** **namakarma**, and **ayu**.

## Vihayoga-gati Namakarma

**Vihayoga-gati** **namakarma** has two types:

1. **Shubha-vihayoga-gati**: This karma leads to a good gait, like that of an elephant or a bull.
2. **Ashubha-vihayoga-gati**: This karma leads to a bad gait, like that of a camel or a donkey.

Page #207:

## First Karma Text

Having described the nature of the *piṇḍa-prakr̥ti*s, now we describe each *prakr̥ti*.

**Gāthā:** Due to the arising of the *parāghāta* karma, the being becomes invincible to the strong. And due to the arising of the *uccvāsa* karma, the being obtains *uccvāsa*.

**Upāsanā-mavasī || 44 ||**

**127**

The eight *prakr̥ti*s which are the *apratipakṣa* of the *viśeṣārtha* karma are as follows:

The characteristics of the *parāghāta* and *uccvāsa* *prakr̥ti*s are as follows:

The karma whose arising makes the being appear invincible even in the eyes of the very strong, is called *parāghāta* karma. In other words, when *parāghāta* karma arises, the being appears invincible not only to the weak, but also to the very strong, intelligent, learned, and opponents. They are defeated by its influence.

The karma whose arising makes the being capable of breathing is called *uccvāsa* karma. Drawing air from outside the body through the nose is called *śvāsa*, and releasing air from inside the body through the nose is called *uccvāsa*. The being obtains the power to perform these two actions from the *uccvāsa* karma.

**ra** The next two *gāthā*s describe the characteristics of the *ātapa* and *udyota* karma.

**ravi-bimbe ujiyangam tāva-juyam āvāja na u jalaṇe | jamusiṇa-phāsassā taha lehi-yaṣannassa ughau tti || 45 ||**

**Anunipāya sarūvam jiyangamujjoyae ihujjoyā. Jaiveyuttavivik yajois khajjoyamāiva. ||46||**

**Gāthārtha:** Due to the rise of the Ātap karma, the body of the jīva becomes warm. Its rise occurs in the earthly body of the solar system, but not in the jīvas of the fire element. They experience the rise of Uṣṇasparśa and Lohitavarṇa karma.  Similar to the light of the moon, stars, and fireflies, the rise of Udyota karma causes the body of the jīva to emit a cool, luminous light, like the bodies of the righteous and the gods.

**Viśeṣārtha:** These two gāthās explain the characteristics of Ātap and Udyota karma, their owners, and the difference between Ātap and Uṣṇasparśa karma.

**(The karma whose rise causes the jīva's body to emit warm light, but not be warm itself, is called Ātap karma.)**

**Ātap karma's rise does not make the jīva itself warm, but it does cause it to emit light, radiance, and warmth. Ātap karma arises in the jīvas of the earth element, outside the sun. Except for these jīvas, Ātap karma does not arise in other jīvas of the solar system.**

**Ātap karma does not arise in the jīvas of the fire element, because Ātap karma only arises in jīvas whose bodies are cool but emit warm light. However, the bodies and light of the jīvas of the fire element are warm due to the rise of Uṣṇasparśa and Lohitavarṇa karma.**

Page #209:
---------------------------
## First Karma Granth

**126 Summary:** The essence is that the bodies of those beings who experience the *Atapanama* karma are themselves cold, but their aura is hot. And the bodies of beings in the *Agnikai* are both hot to the touch and emit hot light. This is the difference between beings with *Atapanama* karma and those with *Ushnasparsha* karma.

Now we explain *Udyotanama* karma.

The karma whose emergence causes a being's body to emit cold light is called *Udyotanama* karma. When *Labdhi-dhari* monks take on a *Vaikriya* body, and when gods take on a *Uttara Vaishya* body compared to their original body, the cold light that emanates from their bodies should be understood as arising from this *Udyotanama* karma. The bodies of beings in the *Prithvi Kaya* like the moon, stars, and constellations emit cold light due to the presence of *Udyotanama* karma. Similarly, the emergence of this *Udyotanama* karma should be understood in fireflies, gems, and other substances that emit light.

Now, in the next verse, we describe the characteristics of *Agurul* and *Tirthankara* karma.

**Verse 47:** The body of a being does not become heavy or light due to the emergence of *Agurul* karma. A being becomes worthy of worship by the three worlds due to the emergence of *Tirthankara* karma. This emergence occurs after the attainment of *Kevalgyan*.

Page #210:
---------------------------
## Karmavipak

**Special Meaning:** The nature of Agurul and Tirthankara karmas has been explained in the head.

The karma whose arising results in the body of the being being neither light nor heavy, but having an Agurulghu result, is called Agurulghunamakarma. Due to Agurulghunamakarma, the being does not perceive its own body as so heavy that it becomes difficult to manage, nor so light that it cannot be saved from flying in the air like cotton wool. In other words, the being does not perceive its own body as heavy or light in weight, but due to the arising of Agurulghunamakarma, it appears to have an Agurulghu result.

The karma whose arising results in the attainment of the Tirthankara position is called Tirthankaranamakarma.

The arising of Tirthankaranamakarma occurs only upon the generation of Kevalgyan. Due to this karma, he becomes Trilokyapujya and attains external splendor in the form of Samvasaran. This splendor is not attained by all Kevalgyanis, but is attained by those who have bound Tirthankaranamakarma. The Kevalgyani, seated in the Tirthankara position, shows the path in authoritative speech, by following which he himself has attained this state of accomplishment. He establishes a Dharma Tirtha, which is also called the fourfold assembly of Shravak, Shraddhika, Sadhu, and Sadhvi.

Even the most powerful and mighty Devendras, Narendras, etc. of the world serve him with great devotion and consider it their good fortune to get the opportunity to listen to his words.

Now, in the next verse, the nature of Nirman and Upadhat karmas is explained.

Page #211:
---------------------------
## First Karma Granth

**Verse 48:** The Karma called **Nirmaan** (Creation) arranges the limbs and appendages of the body in their proper places, like a master architect. The Karma called **Upghaat** (Injury) causes the being to suffer through its body's parts, like the **Lambika** (sixth finger) or other such deformities.

**Explanation:**

The Karma called **Nirmaan** is responsible for the orderly arrangement of the body's limbs and appendages. **Nirmaan** means "organized creation." Just as a painter or sculptor arranges the limbs of a painting or sculpture in their proper places, so too does **Nirmaan** regulate the body's parts. Without this Karma, the limbs and appendages created by the **Ango-Upanga** Karma (Karma of limbs and appendages) would not be properly arranged. In other words, **Nirmaan** ensures that the body's parts are in their correct positions, allowing them to function properly.

The Karma called **Upghaat** causes the being to suffer through its body's parts, such as the **Pratijihva** (a tongue-like growth), **Chauradant** (teeth protruding from the lips), **Lambika** (sixth finger), and so on.

Even when the body's limbs and appendages are properly arranged, some beings may have body parts that are not useful and instead cause suffering. This suffering is caused by the **Upghaat** Karma.

Page #212:
---------------------------
## Karmavipaka

Thus, after stating the nature of the eight non-contradictory (apratipaksa) categories, the following verse describes the nature of the contradictory (sapratipaksa) categories of the Bos (Bosa) nature, namely, Tras, Badar, and Paryapta karmas.

**Verse 132:**

"From the rise of Sanam karma, the jiva becomes two, three, four, and five-sensed; from the rise of Badar karma, the jiva becomes Badar, i.e., gross; and from the rise of Paryapta karma, the jiva becomes endowed with its own appropriate Paryaptis. Paryapta jivas are of two types, based on the difference in Labdhi and Karan."

**Explanation:**

This verse explains the nature of Badar and Paryapta categories among the Sadshak (six) categories.

The karma whose rise results in the attainment of a Shravasakaya is called Tras karma.

There are four types of Tras jivas: (1) Dwi-indriya (two-sensed), (2) Tri-indriya (three-sensed), (3) Chatur-indriya (four-sensed), and (4) Pancha-indriya (five-sensed). Tras jivas are capable of moving from one place to another to protect themselves from heat and cold.

Although Tejasakayik and Vayukayik jivas have the rise of Stavar karma, they are also called Tras due to their slow, crawling-like movement.

Thus, there are two types of Tras: Labdhi and Tis. Dwi-indriya to Pancha-indriya jivas with the rise of Tras karma are Labdhi-Tras, and they are primarily called Tras.

Page #213:

are called. The emergence of the stationary karma called "nama karma" occurs in the tejaskaayik and vaayukaayik beings, and they are stationary. But because they are mobile like the beings, they are called "matitras". These are called "bas" by treatment.
Among the living beings, the dwii-indriya, tri-indriya and chatur-indriya are without mind, and among the panch-indriya, many beings are with mind and many are without mind. But the tejaskaayik and vaayukaayik tras are without mind.
The karma whose emergence causes the being to obtain a "baadar" (gross body) is called "baadar-nama karma".
"What the eye can see", this is not the meaning of "baadar", because one-one "baadar" body of the earth-body etc. cannot be seen by the eyes. But the "baadar-nama karma" manifests a type of expression in the body community of the earth-body etc. beings, due to which those bodies become visible.
"Baadar-nama karma" is the jeeva-vipaakini nature. This nature produces the "baadar" result in the being through the pudgals of the body, due to which they become visible. But those who do not have the emergence of this karma, even if they gather together in the form of a subtle community, they do not become visible.
Even though "baadar-nama karma" is the jeeva-vipaakini nature, the reason for its manifestation through the pudgals of the body is that it is not against the jeeva-vipaakini nature to show its effect in the body. Just as, even though anger is the jeeva-vipaakini nature, its manifestation is - the crookedness of the eyebrows, the redness of the eyes, the fluttering of the lips etc.

Page #214:
---------------------------
Karma-vipaka manifests as results. In essence, karma-shakti is peculiar, so badar-namakarma produces a type of badar result in earth-bodied beings, etc., causing a type of expression to appear in their body community, and they become visible in the body.
The karma whose arising makes beings endowed with their respective paryaptis is called paryapti-namakarma.
The power of a being by which it takes in pudgalas and transforms them into food, body, etc., is called paryapti.
There are six types of paryapti: (1) maha-bharyapsi, (2) shariyat, (3) indriya-paryapti, (4) shwaso-chchwas-paryapti, (5) bhasha-paryapti, (6) man-paryapti.
In the above six paryaptis, in sequence, a one-sense being has four (food, body, sense, breath), a two-sense being, a three-sense being, a four-sense being, and an unconscious five-sense being has the above four paryaptis along with bhasha-paryapti, making five, and conscious five-sense beings have all six paryaptis, from food to mind.
After abandoning the body related to the present existence, in order to take on the body related to the future existence, the being reaches the place of origin and, by means of the karmic body, takes in pudgalas for the first time, which have six divisions in the form of food-paryapti, etc., and by them, all six paryaptis begin to form simultaneously, i.e., from the six parts of the pudgalas taken in for the first time, one part is taken to begin the formation of each paryapti, but their...

Page #215:

## First Karma Granth, 135

"Perfection occurs gradually. That is, after food, the body, after the body, the senses, and so on. In this way, the sequence of perfections should be completed until the attainment of mind-perfection. This can be explained with an example: Just as women spinning yarn begin spinning cotton together, but those spinning thick yarn finish quickly and those spinning fine yarn finish later, similarly, the beginning of perfections happens simultaneously, but their completion occurs sequentially.

In the Audaric, Vaikriya, and Aharak bodies, there are perfections. The sequence of their completion in these bodies should be understood as follows:

The Audaric body of a Bala Jiva completes the first perfection in one moment, and then the second in the next moment, and then the third. Similarly, the fourth, fifth, and sixth are completed sequentially, each in a moment.

The Vaikriya and Aharak bodied Jivas complete the first perfection in one moment, and then the second in the next moment, and then the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth perfections sequentially, one at a time. However, Devas complete both the fifth and sixth perfections sequentially, but together in one moment.

The characteristics of perfections like Ahar, etc., are as follows:

(1) The perfection of the specific power by which a Jiva, by taking in external food pudgalas, transforms them into Khalabhag and Rasabhag, is called Ahar-paryapti."

Page #216:
---------------------------
## 136
## Karma Vipaka
(2) The completeness of the power by which a living being transforms ingested food, which has been converted into rasa, into the seven dhatus is called **Sharira Paryapti**.
The seven dhatus present in the body are: (1) Rasa, (2) Rakta, (3) Maans, (4) Med (fat), (5) Haddi (bone), (6) Majja, and (7) Veerya. One dhatu is formed from the previous one, starting from Rasa and ending with Veerya. 
In addition to these seven dhatus, the body also contains the following seven Upadhatus:
(1) Vaat, (2) Pitt, (3) Shleeshma (Kapha), (4) Shira, (5) Snayu, (6) Charma, and (7) Jathragni.
(3) The completeness of the power by which the soul transforms ingested food, which has been converted into dhatus, into the form of senses like touch, etc., is called **Indriya Paryapti**.
(4) The completeness of the power by which a living being takes in pudgals suitable for breathing, transforms them into the form of breathing, absorbs their essence, and then releases them back is called **Shwaso-chchwas Paryapti**.
(5) The completeness of the power by which a living being takes in pudgals suitable for speech, transforms them into the form of speech, and then releases them back in the form of various sounds, using them as a base, is called **Bhasha Paryapti**.
(6) The completeness of the power by which a living being takes in pudgals suitable for the mind, transforms them into the form of the mind, and then releases them back using the special power of the mind, is called **Manah Paryapti**.
The **Aahar Paryapti** and **Sharira Paryapti** are such that, through **Aahar Paryapti**,

Page #217:
---------------------------
## First Karmagranth 137

This section discusses the formation of **rasa** (essence) through **sharira-paryapti** (body-fulfillment), which is distinct from the **rasa** formed through **aahar-paryapti** (food-fulfillment). This specific **rasa** is crucial for the formation of the body.

The **pudgalas** (particles) used in the formation of food, body, and senses are different from those involved in **shwaso-chchwas** (breathing), **bhasha** (speech), and **manah-paryapti** (mind-fulfillment).

There are two types of **paryapti** (fulfillment) for living beings:

1. **Labdhi-paryapti**: These beings die after fulfilling their respective **paryaptis**, not before.
2. **Karan-paryapti**: This term has two meanings. **Karan** refers to the senses. Beings who have fulfilled their **indriya-paryapti** (sense-fulfillment) are **karan-paryapti**. Since **indriya-paryapti** cannot be achieved without fulfilling **aahar** and **sharira-paryapti**, all three **paryaptis** are considered together. Alternatively, beings who have fulfilled their respective **paryaptis** are called **karan-paryapti**.

Beings with characteristics opposite to **labdhi-paryapti** and **karan-paryapti** are called **labdhi-aparyapti** and **karan-aparyapti**, respectively. Their nature will be discussed later in the context of **sthavar-dashak** (ten types of stationary beings).

The following verse describes the nature of **sthira** (stable), **shubha** (auspicious), and **subhaga** (prosperous) **namakarma** (karmic actions).

**Verse 50:**

**Pasyan tan patte udaye-nam danta-adi-thama-i thiram | Namu-vari sirai suham subhaga-o savva-jana-ittho ||**

This verse describes the nature of **sthira** (stable), **shubha** (auspicious), and **subhaga** (prosperous) **namakarma** (karmic actions).

Page #218:
---------------------------
## Karmavipaka

**Verse Meaning:** Due to the arising of the *pratyek* karma, beings have separate bodies. Due to the *sthira* karma, the bodies of beings have teeth, bones, etc., which are stable. The body parts above the navel being auspicious is *shubha* karma, and the karma that arises and makes a being loved by all is *subhaga* karma.

**Detailed Meaning:** The verse describes the characteristics of four types of karma: *pratyek*, *sthira*, *shubha*, and *subhaga*. These are as follows:

(1) The karma that arises and results in a single being owning a single body is called *pratyek* karma.

(2) The karma that arises and results in the teeth, bones, neck, etc., of a being's body being stable (remaining in their respective places) is called *sthira* karma.

(3) The karma that arises and results in the body parts of a being above the navel being auspicious is called *shubha* karma.

(4) The karma that arises and results in a being being loved by all, even without doing any favors or having any connection, is called *subhaga* karma.

Now, the next verse will describe the remaining types of karma: *susvara*, *aadeya*, *yasha-kirti*, and *dhavara*.

**Verse 5:**

**Verse Meaning:** Due to the arising of *susvara* karma, one has a sweet and melodious voice. Due to the arising of *aadeya* karma, everyone accepts one's words...

First Karma Granth
We pay our respects. From the rise of the Yash Kirti name karma, there is fame and glory, and from the natures of the Sadshak mentioned earlier, one should understand the meaning of the natures of the opposite, the Stavardashaka.
136
The nature of the seven natures of the Sadshak has been mentioned in the first two gathas, and the remaining three natures - Suswar, Aadey and Yash Kirti - and the characteristics of the ten natures of the Stavardashaka, are indicated in this gatha to understand the opposite of the ten natures of the Sadshak. The special discussion is as follows:
(1) The karma from whose rise the voice of the living being sounds pleasing to the listener, is called Suswar name karma; for example, the voice of a cuckoo etc.
(2) The karma from whose rise the speech of the living being becomes universally accepted, is called Aadey name karma.
(3) The karma from whose rise the fame and glory of the living being spreads in the world, is called Yash Kirti name karma.
Yash Kirti, this word, is derived from the two words Yash and Kirti. If praise spreads in one direction, it is called Kirti, and if praise spreads in all directions, it is called Yash, or the fame that comes from charity, penance etc. is called Kirti, and the fame that comes from victory over the enemy is called Yash. In this regard, a poet has said:
Dan-punyakrita Kirti: parakramakrut yam Yash:
Ek diggamini kiti: sarvavigragamaka yam Yash: ||
Now the nature of the ten natures of the Stavardashaka is being told. Their names are as follows:

## 140
**Karmavipaka (1) Sthavar, (2) Sukshma, (3) Apariapt, (4) Sadharan, (5) Asthir, (6) Ashubh, (7) Durbhg, (8) Duhswar, (9) Anadeya and (10) Ayash:kirti.**

**(1) Sthavar Karma:** The karma whose fruition causes a being to remain stationary, lacking the ability to protect itself from cold and heat, is called Sthavar Karma.

Earth-bodied, water-bodied, fire-bodied, air-bodied and plant-bodied beings are Sthavar. They only have the first sense organ, touch.

Fire-bodied and air-bodied beings have natural movement, but they lack the specific movement to protect themselves from cold and heat like the two-sense and three-sense beings. Therefore, they are considered Sthavar. They experience the fruition of Samapanamdhaan.

**(2) Sukshma Karma:** The karma whose fruition causes a being to obtain a subtle body (which neither obstructs nor is obstructed by anything) is called Sukshma Karma.

Beings with this karma are also the aforementioned five Sthavar. They are spread throughout the entire Lokakasha and cannot be seen with the eye.

**(3) Apariapt Karma:** The karma whose fruition causes a being to not fully achieve its own potential is called Apariapt Karma. There are two types of Apariapt beings: Labdhyapariapt and Karanapariapt.

Beings who die without fulfilling their potential are Labdhyapariapt. Beings who are currently Apariapt but will fulfill their potential in the future are Karanapariapt.

Labdhyapariapt beings also only attain fulfillment in the three aspects of food, body and senses after death, not before. This is because all beings die after the bondage of the lifespan of the next birth, and this bondage only occurs for those who have fulfilled the three aspects of food, body and senses.

**(4)** The karma whose arising causes an infinite number of souls to have a single body, meaning that an infinite number of souls are the owners of one body, is called **Saadharan Karma**.

These infinite souls with a common body are interdependent in their life, death, food, breathing, etc. This is why they are called **Saadharan**. In other words, the activities of **Saadharan** beings like eating, etc., are similar and occur at the same time.

Among the five stationary beings, starting with the Earth-bodied, the plant-bodied beings have both **Saadharan** and **Pratiyaka** types of **namakarma**. Here are some ways to identify them:

**3** Those whose veins, joints, and knots are not visible, whose roots, tubers, skin, new buds, branches, leaf-clusters, and seeds break evenly when broken, and whose bark of the tuber, root, branch, or trunk is thick, should be considered **Saadharan**. The opposite of this should be considered **Pratiyaka** plants.

**(5)** The karma whose arising causes the ears, eyebrows, tongue, etc., to be unstable, meaning fickle, is called **Asthir Karma**.

**(6)** The karma whose arising causes the organs below the navel to be inauspicious is called **Ashubh Karma**. Displeasure upon being touched by the feet is a sign of this inauspiciousness.

**(7)** The karma whose arising causes a soul to be disliked by all, even when they do good deeds, and causes other beings to harbor enmity and hatred towards them, is called **Durbhagna Karma**.

**(8)** The karma whose arising causes a soul's voice and speech to be unpleasant and harsh to the listener is called **Dushwar Karma**.

## Karma Vipaka

(1) The karma whose arising causes a being's righteous and good speech to be considered disrespectful and offensive is called Anadeyatmakarma.

(10) The karma whose arising causes a being to spread ill-repute and bad conduct in the world is called Ayasha Kirtinamkarma.

With the explanation of these ten types of Stavardashak, the description of the types of Namkarma is complete. Now we will explain the nature and divisions of Gotra and Antaraya karma.

**Gatha:** Like the potter who makes good pots and pots for liquor, the nature of Gotrakarma is similar. It has two divisions: (1) Uchchagotra and (2) Nichagotra. There are five divisions of Antaraya karma, which obstruct giving, receiving, enjoyment, consumption, and virility.

**Special Meaning:** The gatha describes the nature and divisions of Gotrakarma and the divisions of Antaraya karma. First, Gotrakarma is described. Gotrakarma is the karma whose arising causes a being to be born in a high or low family. There are two divisions of this: (1) Uchchagotra and (2) Nichagotra.

**Explanation:**

1. (a) "Goe nam mante! Kamme kaibihe pan? Goeyama! Drivihe pan te ja - Uchchagoye va Niyagoe ya." - Prajnapan, Pada 23, U. 20263, Tatvarth Sutra 08012.

Page #223:
---------------------------
## First Karma Granth
143

(1) The karma that causes a being to be born in a high lineage is called **high-lineage karma**.
(2) The karma that causes a being to be born in a low lineage is called **low-lineage karma**.

A lineage that has gained fame for a long time due to the protection of dharma and morality is a **high lineage**, such as the Ikshvaku dynasty, the Hari dynasty, the Chandra dynasty, etc. A lineage that has gained infamy and disgrace for a long time due to the practice of adharma and immorality is a **low lineage**, such as the lineage of liquor sellers, butchers, and thieves, etc.

There are eight distinctions of **high lineage** based on the superiority of caste, lineage, strength, form, austerity, knowledge, wealth, and beauty. Similarly, there are eight distinctions of **low lineage** based on the inferiority of these eight qualities, such as inferiority of caste, inferiority of lineage, etc.

Pride (ego) in the above eight qualities leads to bondage for a **high lineage**, while pride in these qualities leads to bondage for a **low lineage**.

**Lineage karma** is like a potter. Just as a potter makes various kinds of pots, big and small, some of which are considered auspicious and used for worship with rice grains, sandalwood, etc., while others are considered inauspicious and used to store things like liquor, etc., similarly, **lineage karma** is of two types: **high** and **low**.

- Uttaraadhyayanasutra 23.141: **High lineage** is the cause of respect for the country, lineage, place, and the prevention of decline in the family. **Low lineage** is the opposite, causing the prevention of respect for the Chandala, Mataka, Dhyagha, bondage, and slavery.
- Satvarayasutra 8.13 Commentary

## Karmavipaka 144

Due to the influence of Gotra Karma, many beings are considered high and many are considered low. Now, we will understand the nature of Antaraya Karma.

Antaraya Karma is the karma that, upon its fruition, causes obstacles, hindrances, and impediments to a being in giving (daan), gaining (laabh), enjoying (bhog), consuming (upbhog), and in their vigor (veerya). This is also called Vighna Karma.

There are five types of Antaraya Karma: (1) Daana Antaraya, (2) Laabh Antaraya, (3) Bhog Antaraya, (4) Upbhog Antaraya, and (5) Veerya Antaraya. Their characteristics are as follows:

1. **Daana Antaraya:** When the materials for giving are present, a worthy recipient is available to receive the gift, the fruit of the donation is known, and the desire to give is present, yet the being is not motivated to give due to the fruition of this karma, it is called Daana Antaraya.

2. **Laabh Antaraya:** When the giver is generous, the object of donation is available, and the receiver is worthy, yet the being does not receive the desired object due to the fruition of this karma, it is called Laabh Antaraya.

3. **Bhog Antaraya:** When the means for enjoyment are present, yet the being cannot enjoy the objects of enjoyment due to the fruition of this karma, it is called Bhog Antaraya.

Page #225:
---------------------------
## First Karma Granth

**(4)**  Even though a being has the means to enjoy something, if they are unable to enjoy it due to the arising of a particular karma, it is called **Upbhogaantaraya**. Things that are enjoyed once are called **bhoga**, like food, etc. Things that are enjoyed repeatedly are called **upbhoga**, like houses, clothes, ornaments, etc.

**(5)** **Veerya** means strength or vigor. If a being is strong and healthy, but unable to perform a particular task due to the arising of a karma, they are unable to utilize their strength and vigor. This is called **Veeryantaraya**.

There are three types of **Veeryantaraya**: **Bal Veeryantaraya**, **Pandit Veeryantaraya**, and **Bal-Pandit Veeryantaraya**. If a being is capable of performing worldly tasks but is unable to do so due to the arising of a karma, it is called **Bal Veeryantaraya**. If a **Samyagdristi** (rightly-seeing) being desires liberation but is unable to perform actions necessary for it due to the arising of a karma, it is called **Pandit Veeryantaraya**. If a being desires to protect their country and religion but is unable to do so due to the arising of a karma, it is called **Bal-Pandit Veeryantaraya**.

The following verse gives an example of **antaraya karma**:

**"Sirihariyasamam jah padkuleṇ teṇ raayai. Na kunadd daṇaiyam evam triggheṇ jivo vi." (53)**

**Meaning:** **Antaraya karma** is like a treasurer in a king's palace. Just as a king cannot give donations if the treasurer is against it, similarly, a being cannot give donations even if they desire to do so, due to the presence of **antaraya karma**.

**Special Meaning:** This verse explains the nature of **antaraya karma** through an example. The nature of **antaraya karma** is like that of a treasurer.

Page #226:
---------------------------
## Karmavipaka

When a king desires to give charity to a petitioner and even orders it, but the treasurer creates an obstacle and prevents the king's desire from being fulfilled, it is similar to the **Antaray Karma**. One should understand that **Antaray Karma** creates an obstacle in the fulfillment of the desires of the soul, the king, for charity, profit, enjoyment, etc.

Just as **Antaray Karma** obstructs the giver's intentions, it also creates obstacles for the receiver, preventing them from obtaining the desired object.

After explaining the various types of the eight karmas, including **Jnanavarana**, we will now discuss the specific causes of their bondage in the following verses.

**Verse 54:**

**Gathaarth:** The soul acquires **Jnanavarana** and **Darshanavarana** karma through **Pratyaneeka** (unfavorable conduct), **Nihnava** (slander), **Upadhat** (harm), **Praddvesha** (hatred), **Antaray** (obstruction), and **Asatan** (attachment).

**Vishesharth:** The specific causes of bondage are those that primarily bind a particular karma and secondarily bind the others, along with the general causes of bondage like **Mithyatva** (false belief). This verse describes the specific causes of bondage for **Jnanavarana** and **Darshanavarana** karma, which are: **Pratyaneeka** (unfavorable conduct), **Nihnava** (slander), **Chhipana** (concealing), **Utsutra** (instigation).

Page #227:
---------------------------
## 147

**Predvesha** - Dvesha, Aruchhi, Irsya, Antaravarnavad - these are the knowledge-obscuring and special causes. Their characteristics are as follows:

**First Karma Granth**
1
**Prarupana** - to misrepresent, **Upghat** - destruction, **Ray** - to oppose, **Asatana** - slander, are the ways in which the Darshanavaran karmas bind.

(1) Acting contrary to knowledge, the knower, and the means of knowledge is called **Pratyaniktvam**.
(2) Hiding the name of the human knowledge-giver, the Guru, saying "I did not learn from them even though I was with them" or "I do not know this subject even though I know it" - this kind of false speech is called **Nindrav**.
(3) Destroying books, weapons, fire, etc. is **Upghat**.
(4) Having hatred and aversion towards the knowers and the means of knowledge, instead of love, is **Predvesha**.
(5) Creating obstacles in the means of knowledge practice, preventing students from receiving the benefits of knowledge, food, clothing, space, etc., making them do other work instead of studying - this is called **Antaraya**.
(6) Slandering the knowers, spreading false or hurtful things about them in the world, creating a web of deceit that causes them deep pain - this is **Asatana**.

Besides the above actions, practicing in forbidden times, places, etc., not obeying the Guru, moving books with one's feet, not allowing books to be used properly, and other similar causes and actions...

Page #228:
---------------------------
## Karmavipaka

By performing actions that show disregard for knowledge, etc., the **Jnanavarana karma** is bound.

The causes mentioned above, such as performing undesirable actions regarding knowledge, the knower, and the means of knowledge, lead to the binding of **Darshanavarana karma** when performed in relation to perception, the perceptive-saint, and the means of perception.

Knowledge and perception are qualities of the soul. Therefore, even the slightest carelessness or disregard for knowledge and its means, perception and its means, is tantamount to harming oneself. Here, the actions that should not be performed for the sake of these qualities are mentioned. Other similar destructive actions should be included in this category.

## Causes of Binding of Vaniy Karma

**148**

**Guruhbhattitikaruna-vayajogak sayavijay danajuo. Vadhammaai ajjai sayamsayam vivajjay. ||55||**

**Meaning of the verse:** Devotion to the Guru, forgiveness, compassion, vows, yoga, conquering passions, giving charity, and remaining steadfast in Dharma lead to the binding of **Satavedaniya karma**. Conversely, acting contrary to these leads to the binding of **Asatavedaniya karma**.

**Special Meaning:** The verse explains the causes of binding for both types of **Vedaniya karma**, **Satavedaniya** and **Asatavedaniya**.

**Sat** means happiness and **Asat** means suffering. The karma that produces happiness upon its fruition is **Satavedaniya**, and the karma that produces suffering upon its fruition is **Asatavedaniya**. **Satavedaniya** is meritorious and **Asatavedaniya**...

Page #229:
---------------------------
## First Karma Granth

**KUT** is sin. Therefore, **saataavedaniya** karma is bound by actions that bring happiness to oneself and others, while **asaataavedaniya** karma is bound by actions that cause suffering. This is the perspective from which the binding of **saataavedaniya** and **asaataavedaniya** karma is explained in the gatha.

**Guru-bhakti**, **kshamasheelata**, **dayaluata**, **vrata-yukta**, **sanyam**, **sadhana**, **kashay-vijay**, **dan-bhavana**, and **dharmic shraddha** are the causes of the binding of **saataavedaniya** karma. Similarly, the word **aady** in the gatha refers to serving the elderly, children, and the sick, helping the righteous in their religious duties, having feelings of friendship and joy, and engaging in activities that benefit the world.

The meanings of the words in the gatha are as follows:

(1) **Guru-bhakti** is serving, respecting, and honoring one's gurus (parents, religious teachers, educators, elder siblings, etc.).

(2) **Kshamasheelata** is forgiving, meaning to tolerate the offenses of those who have wronged us, even when we have the power to retaliate. It is not allowing anger to arise even when provoked.

(3) **Dayaluata** is having compassion for all living beings and striving to alleviate their suffering.

**1. Samahikaae naṁ tamev samaahi pahillabmad.**
- The one who attains samadhi, attains samadhi.
- Bhagavati 71

Page #230:
---------------------------
## Karmavipaka

(4) Abstaining from sins like Himsa (violence) etc. is Vrata (vow). Observing Anuvratas (minor vows) or Mahavrata (major vows) is Vratayuktatva (observance of vows).

(5) Following Yoga, i.e., following Sadvachar (good conduct). The ten types of Sadhu Samachari (good conduct of monks) like Chakraval etc. are called Samyam Yoga.

(6) Even when Kshayas (passions) like anger etc. arise, not allowing them to manifest and conquering them is Kshaya-Vijay (conquering passions).

(7) Giving Dana (charity) to the deserving as per their need, arranging resources, is Danayuktatva (charity). For example, giving medicine to the sick, making the fearful fearless and removing the causes of fear, providing students with the means of education etc., giving food to the hungry, and performing other related tasks.

(8) Stabilizing oneself in Atmic Gunas (spiritual qualities) - Samyakgyan (right knowledge), Darshan (right faith), and Nari (right conduct) - and maintaining stability in them through a righteous life, honesty, and firmness in the words of the Vitarag (liberated ones) is Dharm-Dridhata (firmness in Dharma).

Here, the causes of the bondage of the Saatavedaniya Karma have been explained. Performing actions and having thoughts opposite to these leads to the bondage of Asatavedaniya Karma. For example, not respecting elders, punishing the innocent, having cruel intentions, being prone to intense passions etc. The soul binds Asatavedaniya Karma through actions that cause sorrow, grief, and anguish.

**Causes of the bondage of Darshanmohaniya Karma:**

Umgadesanam, aggnasana, vedavvaharanehi. Dasanmoham Jinmunicheiy sanghai padipio. ||56||

Page #231:
---------------------------
## First Karma Granth

**Verse Meaning:**  Giving advice on the wrong path and speaking ill of the right path, stealing from the Devas (divine beings), and acting against the Jinas, Kevalis, Munis, Chaityas, Sangha, etc., leads to the binding of Darshan-Mohaniya Karma.

**Specific Meaning:** The verse hints at some of the causes of the binding of Darshan-Mohaniya Karma. These are:

1. **Unmarg-Deshana:**  Teaching the causes and actions of the world as the causes of liberation. For example, telling people that sacrificing animals in front of deities is virtuous.  Presenting false views (Mithyadarshan) and other things as means of liberation.  One should understand other similar causes.
2. **Sanmarg-Nash:**  Speaking ill of the path of liberation from the world and attaining liberation. For example, saying there is no liberation, no merit or demerit, and that all happiness is in this life.  "Eat, drink, and be merry."  There is no rebirth!  The body is meant for enjoyment.  Wasting time reading spiritual literature, etc.  These teachings mislead innocent beings away from the right path.
3. **Dev-Dravya-Haran:**  The soul itself, endowed with knowledge, vision, and other qualities, is called Deva.  Similarly, other beings are also Devas.  The resources useful to them are called Dev-Dravya.  Stealing, wasting, or mismanaging resources that are used for the protection of living beings is called Dev-Dravya-Haran.  From a worldly perspective, stealing or using for one's own benefit the offerings made to the Devas is also Dev-Dravya-Haran.

Page #232:
---------------------------
## 152
## Karmavipaka

Neglecting to arrange, remaining silent even when capable while another misuses, is called Devadravya Haran. Similarly, one should understand the taking of dravya for the sake of Jnanadravya Gah and their contacts, etc., as Jarmasthanas.

(4) To slander Jin Bhagwan, the Nirvaran Kevalgyani, to point out faults in them even though they are free from all faults, such as "There can be no omniscient in the world." Not calling them Vitrag even though they use a canopy, chamara, etc., in the Samavasaran, is called Jin Ninda.

(5) To slander Sadhu Muni Rajas, who are adorned with the Ratnatraya, who are the holders of the five great vows, to accuse them of false faults, is called Sadhu Ninda.

(6) To slander virtuous Mahatmas, ascetics, etc., who are accomplished in knowledge, vision, and conduct, is called Chaitya Ninda. And from a worldly perspective, one should understand the slander of memorials, stupas, images, etc., and causing them harm, as Chaitya Ninda.

(7) To slander the Sangha, which is in the form of Sadhu, Sadhvi, Shravak, Shravika, to insult them, is called Sangha Ninda.

Besides these, in the word "Adi" mentioned in the gatha, one should understand the inclusion of Agam, Gurus, Dharma, etc. Acting contrary to them, slandering them, spreading false doctrines, also leads to the bondage of Darshanmohaniya Karma.

## Causes of Bandha of Charitramohaniya and Narakayu

**Duviham Picharanmoham Kasayahasaai Visaya Vivasamano. Bandhai Narayau Maha Rambha Pariggraharo Rudda. ||57||**

Two types of Picharanmoha, due to Kasaya, are the cause of bondage of Narakayu and Maha Rambha Pariggraha.

Page #233:
---------------------------
## The First Karma Text

**Verse Meaning:**  Due to the attachment to passions (kṣayās) like anger, etc., and non-passions (nokṣayās) like laughter, etc., and to objects, a living being binds both types of character-obscuring karma. And a living being who is multi-beginning, multi-grasping, and has a fierce result, binds the karma of hellish life.

**Detailed Meaning:** The verse explains the causes of binding the character-obscuring karma and the four types of life-karma, specifically the causes of binding hellish life. First, it explains the two types of causes for binding character-obscuring karma.

Character-obscuring karma is of two types, based on passions (kṣayās) and non-passions (nokṣayās). The sixteen types of passion-obscuring karma and the nine types of non-passion-obscuring karma, which were mentioned earlier, are bound by the living being due to their intense results. The binding of individual passions should be understood as follows:

(1) A living being with a mind agitated by the arising of infinite-binding anger, pride, deceit, and greed, binds the sixteen types of infinite-binding, non-rejection-covering, rejection-covering, and burning passions.

(2) A living being who is subjugated by the arising of the four non-rejection-covering passions, binds the twelve passions of non-rejection-covering, rejection-covering, and burning anger, etc.

(3) A living being afflicted by the arising of the four rejection-covering passions, binds the eight passions of rejection-covering and burning anger, etc.

(4) A living being with the four burning passions, binds only the four passions of burning anger, etc.

Here, it should be understood that anger, pride, deceit, and greed...

Page #234:
---------------------------
## 154
## Karmavipaka

These four kṣayās do not arise simultaneously, but one of the four arises. Among the four types of kṣayās, namely, anāsādhi, etc., the type of kṣayā that arises will be accompanied by the subsequent types, but not the previous one. For example, if the kṣayā type of apratyākhyānāvaraṇa arises, then along with it, pratyākhyānāvaraṇa, sañcalana types can arise, but not the anantānubandhi kṣayā. Similarly, one should understand about the pratyākhyānāvaraṇa, sañjvalana kṣayā types.

After stating the binding causes of kṣayās, now we will explain the binding of nokṣayās. A being with a disturbed mind, due to laughter, etc., binds six nokṣayās, such as:

(a) A being who acts like a clown, mocks others, and talks nonsense binds hāsya-mohaniya karma.

(b) A being who is interested in seeing colorful and diverse scenes, and is curious about them, with the activities of the eyes, etc., binds rati-mohaniya karma.

(c) A being who is envious, sinful, makes others unhappy, and encourages others for bad deeds binds arati-mohaniya karma.

(d) A being who is afraid himself, creates fear in others, harms, and is cruel binds bhaya-mohaniya karma.

(e) A being who is himself sorrowful and also makes others sorrowful binds śoka-mohaniya karma.

(f) A being who criticizes the fourfold sangha, good conduct, etc., and hates them binds jugupsā-mohaniya karma.

Page #235:
---------------------------
First Karma Grantha
The causes of the bondage of the Vedatrika (three Vedas) are as follows:
(a) The jealous, attached to sensual objects, extremely crooked, womanish being binds the Striveda (knowledge of women).
(b) The self-contented, with mild passions, simple, and virtuous being binds the Purusaveda (knowledge of men).
(c) The extremely desirous of sensual objects, violating the limits of morality, etc. being binds the Napumsaka-veda (knowledge of eunuchs).

After stating the causes of the bondage of the Charitra-mohaniya (deluding) karma, now the causes of the bondage of the Narakayus (life-span in hell) are being told.
Due to excessive activity, excessive attachment, being immersed in the anxiety of its accumulation, cruel dispositions, and killing of the five-sensed beings, meat-eating, frequent indulgence in sexual intercourse, stealing the wealth of others, etc., the being attains the bondage of Narakayus.

Tiryanchayu (life-span in the animal world) and Manushyayu (life-span in the human world) are bound as follows:
Gūḍhahṛdaya, śaṭha, sasalla tiryañcāyu, and the one with mild passions by nature, delighting in charity, and of medium qualities binds the Manushyayu.

The gatha (verse) has sequentially explained the causes of the bondage of Tiryanchayu and Manushyayu.
Regarding the causes of the bondage of Tiryanchayu, it is said that the Gūḍhahṛdaya, i.e., whose heart's matter cannot be known, Śaṭha-sweet-tongued...

Page #236:
---------------------------
## 156
## Karmavipaka

A being who, while outwardly displaying speech, harbors deceit in the mind, is vigilant about his faults and considers it cleverness, binds the **Tirayu** (animal realm).

But a being who is simple-hearted, with little beginning and little attachment, enthusiastic in giving, and due to having subdued passions, possesses compassion, forgiveness, gentleness, etc., towards all beings, binds the **Manushyayu** (human realm).

The phrase "**Maksima Gunon**" in the verse means that binding to **Narakayu** (hell realm) occurs due to inferior qualities, and binding to **Devayu** (heavenly realm) occurs due to superior qualities. A being with moderate qualities binds the **Manushyayu**.

## Binding Causes for Devayu and Namakarma

**Avirma Suraum Basavo'kaamanijjaro Jayai. Saralo Agaravillo Suhanam Annah Asuham.** ||56||

**Meaning:** A being who continuously practices **Samyagdristi** (right faith) and other virtues, and who practices **Balatapas** (austerities in youth) and **Akamanijjara** (freedom from desires), binds the **Devayu**. A being with simple consequences and without pride binds the **Shubha Namakarma** (auspicious name karma) and a being with opposite tendencies binds the **Ashubha Namakarma** (inauspicious name karma).

**Explanation:** The verse explains the causes of binding to **Devayu** and the auspicious and inauspicious natures of **Namakarma**. The causes of binding to **Devayu** are as follows:

Only humans and animals are capable of binding the **Devayu**.

Page #237:
---------------------------
The first Karma Granth is also for those who are at least Samyagdarshi. That is, even though they are unable to follow the Prat etc., those who are Samyagdarshi, either human or Tiryanch, bind Devaayu. To clarify this meaning, the word Aviraat has been given in the verse. The meaning of the word Aadi given along with Aviraat is that even Deshaviraat, Saragsamyami are capable of binding Devaayu. In summary, Aviraat Samyagdarshi, Deshaviraat humans and Niyanch and Saragsamyami humans can bind Devaayu. _ Balatapasvi, that is, those who are Mithyadarshi who do penance like Kayaklesh etc. without understanding their true nature, can also bind Devaayu. _ Due to ignorance, enduring hunger-thirst, cold-heat etc., maintaining chastity in the absence of a woman etc., the depletion of Karma that occurs due to such reasons is called Akamanirjara. Akamanirjara means that the being whose Karma has been depleted without any desire, can bind Devaayu.
After explaining the causes of binding Devaayu, now we will explain the causes of binding the auspicious and inauspicious natures of Naamakarma. Those beings who are simple, that is, free from deceit and deception, whose mind, speech and body have a uniform tendency, are free from pride, that is, those who are not proud of their wealth, prosperity, body, beauty etc., bind the auspicious natures of Naamakarma.
There are three types of pride - Riddhigaurva, Rasagaurva, Saatgaurva.

Page #238:
---------------------------
15.
(a) The fruition of karma (karmavipaka) in the form of wealth, prosperity, and power is called *riddhi*. Considering oneself important due to this is called *riddhi-gaurav*.
(b) The enjoyment of sweet, sour, and other tastes is called *rasagaurav*.
(c) Pride in one's health, beauty, etc. is called *sargaurav*.

Similarly, a being who is afraid of sin and possesses qualities like forgiveness, compassion, and gentleness binds *shubha* (auspicious) *namakarma*.  _A being who acts against the auspicious qualities of *namakarma* binds its inauspicious qualities. For example, deceit, trickery, self-praise and criticism of others, false testimony, taking oaths, misuse of temple funds, public property, etc., abduction, etc. are all actions that bind the inauspicious qualities of *namakarma*. In essence, unethical conduct leads to the binding of inauspicious qualities like hellish existence, bad reputation, and single-sense existence._

**Regarding the binding of *gotrakarma***
_The one who sees virtues, is humble, and is interested in study and teaching, and is a devotee of the Jina, binds the *uchchagotra* (high lineage). Conversely, a being with opposite qualities binds the *nichagotra* (low lineage)._

**Explanation:** There are two types of *gotrakarma*: (1) *uchchagotra* and (2) ...

Page #239:

## First Karma Granth
156

**Lower Sphere |** The verse explains the binding causes of both spheres. While explaining the binding causes of the higher sphere, it says that those beings who are **guna-prekshi**, meaning they are indifferent to the faults of a person and only see their virtues, are admirers of virtues; they are free from the eight types of **bheda** - **jatimad**, **kulamada**, **balamada**, **rupamada**, **shrutamada**, **aishwaryamada**, **labhamadad**, and **tapamada** - meaning they do not have pride in these things. They are always interested in reading and teaching **satsahitya** and are devoted to **Jinendra Bhagwan**, **Siddhas**, **Acharyas**, **Upadhyayas**, **Sadhus**, parents, and virtuous people. They bind the karma of the higher sphere.

On the other hand, those who perform actions opposite to those that bind the karma of the higher sphere, bind the karma of the lower sphere. Seeing faults, having pride in caste, lineage, etc., being disinterested in reading and studying, and not having devotion to **Jinendra Bhagwan**, **Tirthankara**, **Guru**, parents, and other great souls, are the causes of binding the karma of the lower sphere.

**Conclusion of the Binding Causes of Antaray Karma**

**Jiryavirakaro hisaiparayana jayai vigdham.**

1

**Iya kammavivagotham lihio debindasurihi.** || 61 ||

**Verse Meaning:** Those beings who are devoted to sins like violence, etc., and who obstruct the worship of **Jin Bhagwan**, bind **Antaray Karma**. Thus, **Shri Devendra Suri** composed this treatise called **Karmavipak**.

**Special Meaning:** The first half of the verse indicates the binding causes of **Antaray Karma**, and the second half indicates the end of the treatise.

Page #240:
---------------------------
## Karmavigak

The binding of Antarayakarma occurs to those beings who obstruct the worship of the Jina Bhagwan, i.e., by criticizing the Jitendev, by denigrating the Dharma they have established, by hindering the propagation of the virtues, by discouraging those who are progressing towards the virtuous vows, austerities, and self-control, and by engaging in other similar actions.  Furthermore, the binding of Antarayakarma occurs by committing, causing others to commit, and taking pleasure in witnessing the sins of violence, falsehood, theft, lust, and attachment, by obstructing acts of charity, and so on.

Thus ends the treatise 'Karmavipak' composed by Shri Devendra Murti, which generally describes the nature, types, and causes of binding of karma.

**Special Explanation of the Calculation of the Prakritis of Nāmakarma**

In the calculation of the Uttar Prakritis of the eight Karmas, starting with Jñānāvarana, the number of Uttar Gatas for each Karma is specified as per the number of Karmas mentioned in the scriptures, except for Nāmakarma. However, the number of Uttar Bhedas of Nāmakarma is stated as 42, 67, 63, and 103. This difference arises due to the differences in expectations. Now, the order of their calculation should be understood as follows:

**42 Bhedas**: 14 Pind Prakritis, 10 Ashadak, 10 Sthavar Dashak, and 8 Pratiyaka Prakritis. Their names are:

**14 Pind Prakritis**: Gati, Jati, Sharira, Angopang, Bandhan, Sangha, Van, Sanhanan, Sansthan, Varna, Gandh, Ras, Sparsh, Anupurvi, Vihayogati.

Out of 14 Pind Prakritis, the Bhed of Bandhan and Sanghatan Karma are included under the category of Sharir Karma. The remaining 12 Pind Prakritis do not have Bhed of Varna, Gandh, Ras, Sparsh. The remaining 35 Bhed of Prakritis are considered. By including them, the total Bhed becomes 67.

**35 Bhed of 8 Pind Prakritis are:**

**Gati 4** - Narak, Tiryanch, Manushya, Dev.

**Jati 5** - Ekendriya, Dwiendriya, Triendriya, Chaturindriya, Panchendriya.

##  Translation:

**166**

In addition to the 35 varieties of the 8 *piṇḍa* *prakr̥tis* mentioned earlier and the *kamvīpāka* *prakr̥tis*, when the *bandhana* and *saṃghāṭana* *nāmakarma* are taken into account as *śarīra* *nāmakarma*, there are 5 varieties each of *bandhana* and *saṃghāṭana*, and 5, 2, 5, and 8 varieties of *varṇa*, *gandha*, *rasa*, and *sparśa* respectively. Adding these together, we get 63 varieties.

* **Bandhana (5):** *Audārika* *bandhana*, *vaikriya* *bandhana*, *āhāraka* *bandhana*, *taijas* *bandhana*, *kārmaṇa* *bandhana*.
* **Saṃghāṭana (5):** *Audārika* *saṃghāṭana*, *vaikriya* *saṃghāṭana*, *āhāraka* *saṃghāṭana*, *taijas* *saṃghāṭana*, *kārmaṇa* *saṃghāṭana*.
* **Varṇa (5):** *Kṛṣṇa*, *nīla*, *lohiṭa*, *hāridra*, and *śukla*.
* **Gandha (2):** *Surabhīḥ*, *durabhī*.
* **Rasa (5):** *Tikt*, *kaṭu*, *kaṣāya*, *amla*, and *madhura*.
* **Sparśa (8):** *Karkaśa*, *mṛdu*, *guru*, *laghu*, *śīta*, *uṣṇa*, *snigdha*, *rūkṣa*.

**103 Varieties:**

If we replace the 5 varieties of *bandhana* mentioned earlier with the following 15 varieties, we get 103 varieties of *nāmakarma*.

* **Bandhana (15):** *Audārika* *audārika* *bandhana*, *audārika* *taijas* *bandhana*, *audārika* *kārmaṇa* *bandhana*, *audārika* *taijas* *kārmaṇa* *bandhana*, *vaivinya* *vaikriya* *bandhana*, *vaikriya* *taijas* *bandhana*, *vaikriya* *kārmaṇa* *bandhana*, *vaikriya* *taijas* *kārmaṇa* *bandhana*, *āhāraka* *āhāraka* *bandhana*, *āhāraka* *taijas* *bandhana*, *āhāraka* *kārmaṇa* *bandhana*, *āhāraka* *taijas* *kārmaṇa* *bandhana*, *taijas* *taijas* *bandhana*, *taijas* *kārmaṇa* *bandhana*, *kārmaṇa* *kārmaṇa* *bandhana*.

In other words, by adding 15 varieties of *bandhana* in place of the original 5 varieties in the 63 *prakr̥tis*, we get 103 varieties.

## Special Causes of Karma-Bandha: An Agamic Text

This text discusses the specific causes of karma-bandha, as described in the Agamas. While **mithyatva, aviriti, pramada, kshaya, and yoga** are considered the general causes of karma-bandha, there are specific causes for each type of karma-bandha.

The text highlights these specific causes, drawing from the Agamas. Here is an excerpt from the Agamas:

**Jnanavaran-Varshavaran**

**"O Bhagavan! What is the karma-rasa that causes the bondage of the Jnanavaran karma-sharira?"**

**"Gautama! It is caused by:**

* **Hatred towards the wise**
* **Hiding knowledge**
* **Obstructing knowledge**
* **Finding fault with knowledge**
* **Disrespecting knowledge**
* **And engaging in arguments that contradict knowledge..."**

**- Passya Prajnapti, 108.06, Sutra 75-76**

**Meaning:** This excerpt explains that the bondage of the Jnanavaran karma-sharira is caused by specific actions related to knowledge. These actions include hostility towards the wise, concealing knowledge, hindering the pursuit of knowledge, criticizing knowledge, disrespecting knowledge, and engaging in arguments that contradict knowledge.

## First Karma Granth
### 166

Therefore, engaging in pointless debate about knowledge leads to the influx of *Jnanavaraniya Karma*. By adding the word "darshan" or "darshani" (saint) in place of "knowledge" in the aforementioned actions, one incurs the influx of *Darshanavaraniya Karma*.

In this regard, Acharya Shri Umaswati has provided the following text in the Tattvarth Sutra:

> *Tattpradoshanivamat sarayantaraayasadanopayata jnanadarshanavaranyoh.*
> - 306.0.10

### 1
**(3) Vedaniya**

There are two types of *Vedaniya Karma*: *Satavedaniya* and *Asatavedaniya*. The text related to the bondage of the first, *Asatavedaniya*, is as follows:

> *Paradukkhanayae parsoyanayae parjuranyayae paritipanayae parivittayayae parpariavanayae bahunam pananam jav sattanam dukkhanayae soyayae jav pariavanayae evam khalu goyama! Jiwanam assaya yaveyagijja kamma kijjante.* - Vyakhyatprajnapti, Sh. 7, 306, Su. 207

**Meaning:** O Gautam! By causing suffering to others, by causing sorrow to others, by humiliating others, by making others cry, by beating others, by causing others to suffer, by causing suffering, sorrow, and suffering to many beings and living beings, living beings incur the influx of *Asatavedaniya Karma*.

### 2
The text of the Tattvarth Sutra related to this is as follows:

> *Dukhashokatapacrandanavadhaparidevananyatma parobhayasthan yasadvedasya.*
> - A. 6, Su. 11

## Text related to the Seven Deities
> "O Gautama! By having compassion for beings, by having mercy for beings, by having kindness for beings, by having compassion for beings, by not causing pain to many beings, by not causing sorrow, by not causing distress, by not causing torment, by not beating, by not causing suffering, a being accumulates the karma that leads to the seven deities." - Bhagavati, Chapter 7, Verse 6, Sutra 286

**Meaning:** O Gautama! By having compassion for beings, by having mercy for beings, by having kindness for beings, by having compassion for beings, by not causing pain to many beings, by not causing sorrow, by not causing distress, by not causing torment, by not beating, by not causing suffering, a being accumulates the karma that leads to the seven deities.

## Text from the Satyartha Sutra
> "Compassion for living beings, non-attachment, restraint, yoga, patience, and purity are the characteristics of the one who has attained the knowledge of the seven deities." - Satyartha Sutra, Chapter 6, Sutra 12 (4)

## Mohaniya Karma
> "There are two types of Mohaniya Karma: Darshanamohaniya and Charitramohaniya. The causes of Darshanamohaniya are as follows:

> "In five ways, beings accumulate the Durlabhavobdhi (Darshanamohaniya) karma: by speaking ill of the Arhats, by speaking ill of the Dharma taught by the Arhats, by speaking ill of the Ayariyauvazhā, by speaking ill of the Sangha of the four qualities, by speaking ill of the gods who are in seclusion." - Syananga, Chapter 5, Verse 2, Sutra 426

**Meaning:** In five ways, beings accumulate the Durlabhavobdhi (Darshanamohaniya) karma: by speaking ill of the Arhats, by speaking ill of the Dharma taught by the Arhats, by speaking ill of the Ayariyauvazhā, by speaking ill of the Sangha of the four qualities, by speaking ill of the gods who are in seclusion.

Page #251:
---------------------------
This is a description of the **avarnavada** (criticism) of the Dharma (religion) that has been preached by the **Jinas**, the **Acharyas** and **Upadhyayas**, the four types of **Sangha** (community), and the **Devas** (divine beings) who are the holders of mature **tapas** (austerity) and **brahmacarya** (celibacy).

**Tattvarthasutra** text:
**Kevalishrutasanghdharmadevavarnavado darshanamohahya.** - Chapter 6, Sutra 13

**Charitramohaniya karmabandha** related text:
**Mohaniyajjakkammasarirapppaogapucchha, goyama! Tivvakohyaaye tivvamanayaaye tinchmaayaaye tivvlobhaaye tibbvadansanamohaniyajjaaye tibbvacharitamohaniyajjaaye.** - Ma. Pra. Sha. 2, U. 10351
**Meaning:** (**Charitra**) How does the **mohaniya karma** (karma that binds to the body) occur? **Gautama:** Through three types of anger, three types of pride, three types of deceit, three types of greed, three types of **darshanamohaniya** (karma that binds to the senses), and three types of **charitramohaniya** (karma that binds to conduct).

**Tattvarthasutra** related text:
**Kashayodiyattimraparinamascharitramohasya.** - Chapter 6, Sutra 14

**(5) Ayukarma**
There are four types of **ayukarma** (karma that determines lifespan): **naraka** (hell), **tiryanch** (animal), **manushya** (human), and **deva** (divine). Each of these has its own separate cause of binding. While the texts for the causes of binding for **naraka**, **tiryanch**, **manushya**, and **deva** are separate, the text for the cause of binding for all lifespans is generally cited.

1. To point out faults where there are none, to criticize, is **avarnavada**.

Page #252:

## 172
**Causes of Binding to the Hellish Realm**

A being binds to the hellish realm in four ways: by excessive initiation, by excessive attachment, by killing five-sensed beings, and by consuming the flesh of the dead.

**From the *Sthānāṅga Sūtra*, Chapter 4, Verse 3013:**

> "Excessive initiation and excessive attachment are the causes of a being's hellish existence."

**From the *Tattvārtha Sūtra*, Chapter 19:**

> "Excessive initiation and excessive attachment are the causes of a being's hellish existence."

## 19
**Causes of Binding to the Animal Realm**

A being binds to the animal realm in four ways: by deceit, by concealing deceit, by false speech, and by cheating in weights and measures.

**From the *Sthānāṅga Sūtra*, Chapter 4, Verse 373:**

> "A being binds to the animal realm through deceit, concealing deceit, false speech, and cheating in weights and measures."

**From the *Tattvārtha Sūtra*, Chapter 19:**

> "Deceit is the cause of a being's animal existence."

## 7
**Causes of Binding to the Human Realm**

A being binds to the human realm in four ways: by pride, by arrogance, by greed, and by bad conduct.

**From the *Sthānāṅga Sūtra*, Chapter 4, Verse 373:**

> "A being binds to the human realm through pride, arrogance, greed, and bad conduct."

**From the *Tattvārtha Sūtra*, Chapter 6, Verse 16:**

> "Pride, arrogance, greed, and bad conduct are the causes of a being's human existence."

Those who are attached to Maya and are worldly, they obtain the human birth due to their past karma.
-Uttaradhyayanasutra, A... | 20 Aryas - Four ways in which a being binds itself to the human birth - by having a good nature, by having humility in nature, by having compassion in nature, and by not having jealousy in nature.
Those beings who, through various teachings, accept the highest vows, they obtain the human birth as a result of their good karma. The text of Tattvarth Sutra says, "Alparambhaparigrahatvam manushyasya. Svabhavamardavancha."
-A. 6. Mr. 17, 18 Reasons for the bondage of Devatas
In those places, beings bind themselves to the Devatas due to their karma, such as - by attachment to restraint, by restraint of restraint, by childish austerity, and by desireless old age.
-Sthananga, Sthan 4, U. 4, Su. 373 Meaning - In four ways, beings bind themselves to the Devatas. By attachment to restraint, by restraint of restraint, by childish austerity, and by desireless old age.
If in the Vaimānika Devas, a being is born with the characteristics of a human being, who has attained the state of Samyagdrsti, has lived for a sufficient number of years, has a karmic body, and is born from the womb, then is it possible that he is born with the characteristics of a restrained Samyagdrsti, an unrestrained Samyagdrsti, a restrained-unrestrained Samyagdrsti, or a being who has attained the state of Samyagdrsti due to the number of years he has lived? Yes, it is possible. This is true until the last karma.
-Prajnapana, Pada 6 _Meaning - If in the Vaimānika Devas, a being is born with the characteristics of a human being, who has attained the state of Samyagdrsti, has lived for a sufficient number of years, has a karmic body, and is born from the womb, then is it possible that he is born with the characteristics of a restrained Samyagdrsti, an unrestrained Samyagdrsti, a restrained-unrestrained Samyagdrsti, or a being who has attained the state of Samyagdrsti due to the number of years he has lived? Yes, it is possible. This is true until the last karma.

From the Karmavipaka Gdasti, how many of the Asanyata Samyagdristi Paryaptakas, and the Samyata-Asamyata Samyagdristi Paryaptakas, are born in the number of years of their lifespan?
O Gautama! All three are born in the Achyuta heaven.
The text of the Tattvartha Sutra
Saragsamyama Samyama-Asangrama-Akamanirjarabalatapaansi Devasya. Samyaktvaṁ ca.
-A. 6, S. 20-21 Generally, the cause of bondage in all four lifespans
Egantwale Nanu Manusse Neraiyauyanti Pakarei, Tiriyayauyanti Pakarei, Manussauyamphi Pakarei Devaauyapi Pakarei.
-Tyaakhya Praapti, S. 1, 30 8, S. 63 Meaning: A person who is Ekantbal (without virtue and restraint) binds the hellish lifespan, binds the animal lifespan, binds the human lifespan, and also binds the divine lifespan.
The text of the Tattvartha Sutra: Ni:sheelavatatvam ca sarvesham.
-06, S. 16 (6) Namekarma
There are two types of Namekarma - auspicious and inauspicious. The text regarding the causes of bondage of both is as follows:
Subhanamakamma Sarira Puchcha? Go-yama! Kayaujjuyayaye Bhavujuyayaye Bhasujuyayaye Avisanvadanajogenaṁ Subhanamakamma Sarirajavapayogabandhe, Asubhanamakamma Sarira Puchcha? Go-yama! Kayanujuyayaye Jab Visanvayanaajogenaṁ Asubhanamakamma Jav Payogabandhe.
-Vyakhya Prasasti S. 06

Page #255:
---------------------------
## The Karma Granth of Effort
**175**

**Meaning:** How is the body of auspicious name-karma obtained?

O Gautama! By the simplicity of the body, the simplicity of the mind, the simplicity of speech, and by not engaging in other activities, the body of auspicious name-karma is bound.

How is the body of inauspicious name-karma bound?

On the contrary, by the crookedness of the body, mind, and speech, and by engaging in other activities, the body of inauspicious name-karma is bound. The text of the Tattvartha Sutra states: "Yoga-vriti-visamvadanam ca ashubhasya namnah. Tadviparitam shubham."

**Chapter 6, Sutra 22, 23:**  Name-karma holds a special place in the Tirthankara's name. Therefore, there are specific reasons for its binding. These specific reasons are described as follows:

**1.** Arhant-bhakti, Siddha-bhakti, Pravachana-bhakti, Stavira (Acharya)-bhakti, Bahushruta-bhakti, Tapasvi-vatsalata, continuous use of knowledge, keeping the vision pure, being humble, and fulfilling necessities...

Page #256:
---------------------------
176
The reasons due to which a living being binds the Tirthankar nature are:
Performing karmic retribution, observing faultless conduct and vows, considering the world as transitory, performing austerities according to one's capacity, renunciation, practicing equanimity, attaining the supreme knowledge, devotion to the scriptures, devotion to the preaching, and propagating the teachings.

The text of Tattvartha Sutra:
Purity of perception, disciplined conduct, faultless behavior towards the virtuous, constant contemplation, spiritual urgency according to one's capacity, renunciation and austerities, equanimity, serving the preceptor, erudition, devotion to the preaching, and propagating the path - these are the causes of attaining the Tirthankar nature.

(7) Gotra Karma
There are two types of Gotra Karma - low and high. First, the causes of binding the low Gotra are described, followed by the causes of binding the high Gotra.

Low Gotra:
Due to the pride of caste, clan, strength, beauty, and lordship, the bondage of the body and its activities occurs.

High Gotra:
Due to the absence of pride of caste, clan, strength, beauty, and austerity, the bondage of the high Gotra occurs.

## First Karma Granthya

**174**  Suyamdena, Labhamdena, Isariyamdena, Ucchagoya Karma, Sarira, Javam, Payogabandhe.

**Commentary:**  Pride in birth, family, strength, beauty, austerity, knowledge, wealth, and power leads to the bondage of the body through the karma of high lineage.

**Tattvartha Sutra on Low and High Lineage Bondage:**

* **6, Sutra 25, 26 (8) Antaray Karma:**  Condemnation of the soul, praise of the self, covering and revealing good and bad qualities, are the causes of bondage through low lineage. The opposite of these actions leads to the bondage of high lineage.

**Antaray Karma:**

**Daanantarayena, Labhantarayena, Bhogatrayena, Uvabhogantrayena, Virayantarayena, Antaraiyakamma, Sarirapayogabandhe.**

**Commentary:**  Obstacles in giving, receiving, enjoying, experiencing, and in virility lead to the bondage of the body through Antaray Karma.

**Tattvartha Sutra on Antaray Karma:**

* **6, Sutra 27:**  Obstruction is the cause of Antaray Karma.

**Special Note:**  Here, the Agam Sutras and the Tattvartha Sutra mention the specific causes of bondage for the eight karmas. The similarities and differences in the causes mentioned in these texts and the Karma Granths are due to the fact that the authors, while primarily relying on the Agam Sutras, have expressed the causes of bondage in their own language, style, sentence structure, and effort to simplify. This should be understood as a difference in style of expression. However, the fundamental objective and intention is to mention the causes of karma bondage based on the Agams. Therefore, despite the apparent difference in language and style, there should be no misunderstanding of the underlying meaning.

Generally, there is a significant degree of similarity in the subject matter presented in karma texts authored by theoreticians, karma text writers, and Svetambara and Digambara Acharyas regarding the bondage of karma, its emergence, the state of existence, the Gunasthanas, the Marganas, and the relationship of karma to these. If there are any differences, they are to be considered worthy of examination based on the principle of "Wade Wade Jayate Tattvabodhah" (Truth is revealed through debate), for the purpose of deeper study and contemplation of the subject of karma.

There are similarities in the Svetambara and Digambara karma texts regarding the interpretation and usage of the term "Jiva," the nature of the Kevalajnani (Omniscient Being) in terms of "Sanjnitva" (consciousness) and "Asanjnitva" (unconsciousness), the flag-like nature of the Vayukadik (air-based) body, the time frame for the use of the "Chhadmasthik" (false body), the nature and examples of "Bhavaleshya" (emotional states), the meaning of the fourteen Marganas, the interpretation of "Samyaktva" (right faith), "Kshayik Samyaktva" (diminishing right faith), the presence of "Dravyamana" (substance) in a Kevali, the twenty-nine numbers indicating the number of "Garbhaja" (born in the womb) humans, the special characteristics of the "Indriyamana" (sense organs) such as "Dvi-Indriya" (two senses), the special characteristics of the "Kayamargna" (body-path) such as "Tejaskaya" (body of light), the number of "Vigraha" (divisions) in "Vakragati" (curved path), the number of uses in "Gunasthan" (stages of spiritual progress), the number of causes of karma bondage being two, four, or five, and the consideration of general and specific causes of bondage. The style of presentation in both is similar.

In addition to these, there are some topics where, despite some differences, there is a greater degree of similarity.

## First Firm Granth
176 Along with this, there are also some differences in certain statements, which are being briefly presented.

**Nature Difference** - In this, the word "prakriti" has been given two meanings - (1) nature and (2) community. Both these meanings are found in the Svetambara karma literature, but in the Digambara literature, only the meaning of "nature" for the word "prakriti" is mentioned. For example - "Prakriti svabhavah", "Prakriti: svabhavah ityanaanataram", "Payadi sile sahavo" etc.

**Evidence of the Side** - A word that has a case ending or where the meaning ends in a particular part is called a "pad". But in "padashruta", "pad" does not refer to such a word, but to a symbolic word. The evidence of the Acharanga and other Agamas is counted in such words. It is not known how many "pralokas" this symbolic word is considered to be, as the corresponding sect has been destroyed. This is written somewhere in a commentary, and somewhere it is also written that there are approximately 51,08,86,840 shlokas in one "pad". 1. (a) "Prakritistu svabhavah syad jnanavrttyadi kamagam. Yatha jnanam avanaadih sthitih kalavinischayaih." - Lokaprakash, Sarg 10, Imok 137 (b) "Shivam shravanasm thii paaes badho paamagahanam cha. Tanaraso anubhaago tassasamudayo pagai bandho." - Here it should be noted that in the meaning of "nature", "anubhagabandh" refers only to the karmic power of fruition, its auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, and its intensity and mildness. But in the meaning of "community", "anubhagabandh" refers to the karmic power of fruition, its auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, and its intensity and mildness. 2. Tattvarthsutra, A. 8, Sutra 3, Sarvarthasiddhi and Rajavattika commentary. 3. Gommatasar, Karmakanda, Ga. 3.

**Karmavik**

In Digambara literature, the word "pad" in "padashruta" also has a symbolic meaning, signifying "chigya" (knowledge). The authority of texts like Acharanga is also considered to be based on such "pads." However, a significant difference is observed: while in Swetambara literature, all Acharyas show a distinction in the interpretation of "pad" as evidence, in Digambara literature, the evidence of "pad" is explicitly stated. There, a single "pad" is considered to consist of 1,634 crore, 83 lakh, and 7 thousand aksharas (letters). This, when considering a shloka (verse) to be 32 aksharas, equates to 21.08,84,62 shlokas.

This evidence, along with the "pad" evidence mentioned in some parts of Swetambara literature, seems to indicate a degree of agreement.

**Man:paryayajnan**

Regarding the object (vishaya) of Man:paryayajnan, two different accounts are found. The first states that a Man:paryayajnani, through Man:paryayajnan, knows the objects (chinyaman padarthas) residing in the minds of others. The second account states that Man:paryayajnan does not provide knowledge of the object being contemplated (chintyaman vastu), but rather knowledge of the mental formations (aakritiyaan) that arise during contemplation. Knowledge of the contemplated object is obtained later through inference. The first account is from Digambara literature, while the second is from Swetambara literature.

## First Difference

**Regarding the origin of Avadhijnana and Manahparyayajnana, the Digambar literature mentions aspects that are not found in the Svetambar literature.**

**Concerning the origin of Avadhijnana, the Digambar literature states that it originates from those regions of the soul that are present in the auspicious limbs marked by conch shells, etc.**

**The origin of Manahparyayajnana is from those regions of the soul that are connected to Dravyaman, and the location of Dravyaman is the heart. In other words, the cessation of Manahparyayajnana occurs in the regions of the soul located in the heart.**

**The concept of Dravyaman, as described in the Digambar literature, is not found in the Svetambar literature. The Digambar literature states that Dravyaman resides in the heart. Its shape is like an eight-petaled lotus. It is formed from the skandhas of Manovagana. Its formation involves the emergence of Antaranga Karma and Angopanganam Karma.**

**Regarding the three types of Mithyatvamohaniya (false belief and delusion), the Svetambar literature uses the analogy of rice grains to explain the three types: Samyaktva (right belief), Mithyatva (false belief), and Misra (mixed belief).**

**They consider pure rice grains, washed and free from husk, as Samyaktva, rice grains with husk and unwashed as Mithyatva, and partially washed and partially unwashed rice grains as Misra.**

**However, the Digambar literature uses the analogy of ground rice grains. They consider rice grains with husk as Mithyatva, those completely free from husk as Samyaktva, and the particles (grains) as Misra (mixed belief).**

**The primary cessation (of Mithyatvamohaniya) is...**

**Karmavipaka Samyaktvaparinaam (Granthibhedajanaya Samyaktv)**, which purifies the Dalik of the Mohaniya, is considered to be **Chakki Sthaaniya**.

The **Kashaya** are compared to various substances in **Upmaa-Karmagranth** and **Gommatasar Jeevakand Gatha 286**. All these comparisons are essentially the same, the only difference being that in **Parsaar**, **Prasmaasyanavaran** is compared to the dirt on the body for **Lobha**, while in **Karmagranth**, it is compared to **Kajal**.

The nature of **Apvartya Aayu** is explained in the commentary of **Apvartya Aayu-Karmagranth Gatha 23**, where this death is called **Akalamaran**, and in **Gommatasar Karmakaand Gatha 57**, it is called **Kadali Dhaatmaran**. This word **Kadali Dhaat** is not found anywhere else in the sense of untimely death.

The order of the **eight Karmas** - **Jnaanabaran** etc. - is explained in the **Shwetaambar Granth Panchasangrah Tika**, **Karmavipaka Tika**, **Jayasomasurikrit Tabba**, and **Jeevijayajikrit Balavabodh** as follows:

**Upayog** is the characteristic of the **Jeev**. It has two aspects: **Jnaan** and **Darshan**. **Jnaan** is considered to be the primary aspect. Only through **Jnaan** can one contemplate a scripture. When one attains something, the **Jeev** becomes **Jnaanopuyogee**. Moksha is also attained during **Jnaanopuyogee**. Therefore, the **Karma** that covers **Jnaan** - **Jnaanavaran** - is mentioned first. The tendency towards **Darshan** arises after the **Jeev's Jnaan**.

1. **Gommatasar, Karmakaand, Gatha 26**

Page #263:
---------------------------
## Translation:

163. The first is the Karma Granth, from which the Darshanavaranakarma is described after the Gnanavaran. Both Gnanavaran and Darshanavaran cause intense experiences of suffering upon their arising and happiness upon their destruction, hence the Vedaniyakarma is described after them. The intention behind mentioning the Mohaniyakarma after the Vedaniyakarma is that during the experience of pleasure and pain, attachment and aversion inevitably arise. The reason for mentioning the Ayukarma after the Mohaniyakarma is that a confused being, due to attachment, binds itself to a lifespan, beginning with birth. The being that experiences the arising of lifespan also has to experience the Karma called "Gati" and others. This is explained by the saying "Ashu ke yatma gan": a being experiencing the arising of "Gati" and other Karmas has to experience the results of a high or low birth. This is why the Gotrakarma is mentioned after the Namakarma. Those with a high birth experience the destruction of Danaantaryay and other Karmas, while those with a low birth experience their arising. This is why the Antaryaykarma is mentioned after the Gotrakarma.

The Digambar text Gommatasar Karmakanda also has a similar explanation for the order of the eight Karmas. However, it is important to note that even though the Antaryaykarma is destructive, it is mentioned last, after the Aghatikarma. This is because even though it is destructive, it does not completely destroy the qualities of the being like the Aghatikarma. Its arising is caused by the Aghatikarma like Nama and others. The Vedaniyakarma, even though it is Aghati, is mentioned among the Ghatikarma because it destroys the qualities of the being due to the power of the Mohaniyakarma, like the Ghatikarma.

**Difference in the Names of Karma-Prakritis:** The names of the eight karma-prakṛitis are almost the same in both traditions. There are some names where a slight change is seen.

**Difference in the Definition of Karma-Prakritis:** There is a great deal of similarity in the definitions of karma-pravṛitis in both Shvetambar and Digambar karma-literature. The differences in the definition of some prakṛitis, their names and definitions are as follows:
