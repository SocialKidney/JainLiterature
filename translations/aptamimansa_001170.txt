**Dedication**

Your creation, O Lord! is dedicated to you.
O Adorable Gurudev Swami Samantabhadra! This unique and unparalleled work of yours, Devagam (Aptmimamsa), was received by me about 70 years ago. Since then, it has been my constant study material, and I have been engaged in acquiring a proper understanding of it through its study, contemplation, and understanding of its essence. How far I have been able to achieve that understanding, and to what extent I have been able to comprehend the deep and profound meaning of the words and phrases of this text, can be known in brief from the translation of the text, which is greatly indebted to the AshtaSahasri commentary of your devoted follower, Acharya Shrividyanandaji. You alone can know it fully. I only understand that the vision I have gained by worshipping you, to whom I am greatly indebted, and the understanding I have gained through that vision, by whatever means, is the result of this work. Since it reflects your thoughts, it is truly your creation, and therefore, it is dedicated to you with reverence. You are the embodiment of public welfare. If this work, by your grace, can contribute in any way to public welfare, I will consider myself somewhat relieved of my debt to you.

**With humility**
Jugalkishor

** प्रकाशकीय **

In 1964, the Veer Seva Mandir Trust published "Samadhimaranotsah Deepak" and now the present work, "Devagam (Aaptamimamsa)" by Swami Samantabhadra is being printed along with its Hindi commentary. This Hindi commentary has been written by the renowned scholar of literature and history, and a devoted follower of Swami Samantabhadra, the learned Pandit Jugalkishorji Mukhtar, the Superintendent of the Veer Seva Mandir Trust. It is not unknown to the learned readers that almost all the available works of Swami Samantabhadra are extremely profound, difficult and complex. Only "Ratnakarandaka Shravakaachar" is a work that is relatively simpler than the others. But it is a theoretical work and therefore its simplicity is natural. The teachings of religion should be in simple language. Among the remaining works of Samantabhadra, "Stuti-Vidya" is a high-quality work of poetry and poetics, which reveals Samantabhadra's scholarship in this field. Devagam, Yuktyanusasan and Swayambhustotra are all philosophical works, which are the representative works of Jain philosophy and which illuminate the entire Jain literature.

It is a matter of joy that Mukhtarsahb has been blessed to be the commentator of the remaining four works, excluding Stuti-Vidya. He himself studied, pondered and practiced these works for years and then wrote commentaries on them. Although he did not learn these works from a guru, yet he understood their essence as well as he presented it in his commentaries, perhaps even someone who learned them from a guru could not do so well. He wrote these commentaries based on commentaries, dictionaries and other texts and he had to work hard for it. As a result, he has proved to be a successful commentator and a deep scholar of these texts.

The present Devagama-Bhashya is presented in the same order. Like the Swayambhustotra, Yuktyanusasan, etc., they have given a good meaning-explosion of each word-sentence, etc., and have succeeded in presenting the heart of the author. They are grateful to the society, especially the scholars, for presenting this important work. _We had promised to write its preface. But we are very sorry that we could not write it soon, due to which there has been a delay of one and a half years in its publication. We apologize to the readers for this. The patience and affection of Mukhtar Sahib were instrumental in writing the preface, so we are also grateful to him._
Here we want to reveal that this book had to be printed in two presses for some reasons. The original text (pp. 1-112) was printed in Manohar Press and the rest in Mahavira Press. We cannot forget to thank Mahavira Press for its promptness.
We hope that the readers will be happy to receive this important work and forget the inconvenience caused by the delay. 11 April 1967,

## Translational Statement

Translation refers to the rendering of a statement in accordance with the original. A translation that does not follow the original closely, goes beyond the original's scope, or includes extraneous points unrelated to the subject matter, is not worthy of being called a translation. The text being translated here is the 'Devagama', an unparalleled work by the great Acharya, like a Swami, whose words are said to be rarer than the acquisition of large, round, smooth pearls that adorn the necks of noble men. It depicts the worldly beings as rare as the human birth while wandering through the cycle of births and deaths, and declares it as radiant as the words of Lord Mahavira. The name 'Devagama' is related to the word 'Devagama' at the beginning of the text; just as the texts like 'Bhaktamar', 'Kalyanmandir', 'Swayambhustotra', etc. have taken their names according to the initial word, similarly, this text, which is actually an extraordinary type of stotra-granth, has been called 'Devagama' according to its initial word. Its other name is 'Aptmimamsa', which takes into account the examination of the words of the Aptas - those who are omniscient - and the determination of the truth and falsehood of their opinions. All the texts of Samantabhadra have two names; for example, the other name of 'Jinshatak' is 'Stutivijya' and the other name of 'Yuktyanushasan' is 'Veerajinastotra', which is written in praise of Shri Veerajina after examining all the Aptas - omniscients - after the Devagama. The name of any text of Samantabhadra is not only based on the initial word but also has a quality suffix, Devagama is also such a name, it is not only indicative of the arrival of the gods according to the original author but also indicative of the meaning by which the arrival of the Jinenra Dev is expressed.

The original verses of Devagama are 194 in total, seemingly simple to understand...

---------------------------
## Devagam

While Devagam doesn't seem particularly difficult from a general perspective, it becomes very profound and rich in meaning when considered from the viewpoint of special and consequential meanings. Almost all the verses are in the form of sutras. Many verses contain several sutras bound together. The sutra style is generally a style of expression in a very concise form, and therefore, to explain the meaning of the sutras or verses in the form of sutras, one has to go through many things, which can help understand the situation in front of the sutra-maker, any particular opinion or question that was present, which led to its manifestation. Shri Akalankdev has explained the meaning of Devagam in his Ashtshati (equivalent to eight hundred verses) commentary in the form of sutras. But from the point of view of the subject, these sutras have become so difficult and inaccessible that even good scholars, let alone ordinary scholars, cannot easily understand them. Taking the aforementioned Ashtshato-bhashya, Shri Vidyānandācārya has written an ornamentation called Ashtsahasri (eight thousand verses) on Devagam, which makes the sutra-meaning of Ashtshati clear and reveals its depth and complexity. This Ashtsahasri-tika is also full of difficult words from the point of view of the subject, and therefore, a scholar Yashvijay (Shvetambara Acharya) had to write a commentary on it, which also became equivalent to eight thousand verses. This makes it even clearer how profound, deep and rich in meaning the original text is.

Vidyānandācārya himself has called Ashtsahasri 'Kastsahasri', meaning that its creation was done by enduring thousands of hardships, and this is not hidden from those knowledgeable readers who create such research-oriented important texts, they experience that hardship at every step - it is not something that ordinary knowledgeable readers can understand. It is true, what is the pain of childbirth to a barren woman? Acharya Mahāśaya has said one thing in this Ashts...

## Translation:

**Translational**
**11**

It is further written in the *Vishesh* of the *Ashta Sahasri* that, "What is the use of listening to a thousand scriptures when one should listen to the *Ashta Sahasri*, which alone reveals the true nature of both the present and the past times?" This is not merely a statement written in praise of its own text, but a reflection of the true state of affairs. Once, Seth Pan. Mewaramji of Khurja told me that a German scholar had said to him, "One who has not read the *Ashta Sahasri* is not a Jain, and one who has read the *Ashta Sahasri* and has not become a Jain has not understood the *Ashta Sahasri*." How significant this statement is, and how much it exalts the glory of the *Ashta Sahasri* coming from the mouth of an experienced scholar! Truly, the *Ashta Sahasri* is an unparalleled work, and it unveils the essence of the *Devaagam*. It is a pity that till today, no Hindi translation of such an important work has been published in a manner befitting its grandeur. Those who have studied the art of praise know how much mastery Samantabhadra had over words. To reverse the second line of a verse, to reverse the first half of a verse, and to reverse the entire verse and create another verse was child's play for him. He would present two verses with two meanings, keeping the letters of a single verse exactly the same, by combining them or placing them separately. In praise of Shri Veer Bhagwan, there is a line in a verse, "Shrimete Vardhamanaya Namo Namitavidvishe." This same line is also the second line of the next two verses. However, the meaning of the three verses is mostly different from each other. All these things express the importance of the composition. The present *Devaagam* is also not untouched by such artistic significance. In it, a *karika* placed in one place has one meaning, placed in the middle of some other *karikas* in another place has a different meaning, and placed in a third place...

## Devagam

The third meaning arises when it is kept. It is the karika named 'Virodhannobhayekaatmya', which is placed in 9 places in the text and has a different meaning in each place from the perspective of the text reference - the meaning that occurs in one place does not occur in another.

It is a matter of wonder that a person like me, who has neither received a systematic education in any school-college and obtained a degree, nor studied the text directly from the Guru, would translate such a profound, serious and meaningful text by such a great Acharya! Yet, my devotion to Swami Samantabhadra and his words is making all this wonderful work possible for me. 'Tvadbhaktireve Mukharikurute Balanmam' - this saying of Mantunga Acharya is apt here. Inspired by this devotion, I have previously presented translations of three texts of Swami Ji - Swayambhustotra, Yuktyanusasan and Samichin Dharmashastra, which have been found interesting by scholars. In this regard, it would not be inappropriate to quote a sentence from Late Nyayaacharya Pt. Mahendrakumarji here, which he wrote in the 'Praakkathana' of Tattvanusasan regarding the translation of the text:

"The beautiful translation of a complex and profound text like Yuktyanusasan, presented by Samantabhadra Swami's devoted devotee, literature-tapasvi Pt. Jugalkishorji Mukhtar, with such unimaginable simplicity, will be a light for the authorities of Nyaya Vidya." - I have been encouraged by such scholarly statements and I have been constantly moving forward in my work.

I received Devagam about 70 years ago in Jaipur, written in the Jaipur language of 60 Jayachandji, along with a commentary. After self-study, I lovingly copied it for my own reading on good, strong paper in script form, which has 90 pages and was completed on Mangsir Badi Saptami, Samvat 1955. 

Page #14:
---------------------------
This handwritten manuscript is still safely preserved in my collection. This commentary inspired me to look at other commentaries for more information about the text and to solve the puzzles that this commentary could not solve, and I have been constantly searching for them. In 1975, the first fascicle of the Sanatana Jain Granthamala was published from Bombay, which contained a commentary (Sanskrit commentary) by Vasunandī Ācārya. This commentary seemed to be useful in terms of word meanings. At the end, the Ācārya has mentioned Svāmī Samantabhadra with epithets like 'Tribhuvanalabdhajayapatāka', 'Pramannayacakṣu' and 'Syādvādaśarīra' and has written himself as 'Śrutavismaranśīla' and 'Jaḍamati' and has indicated that this commentary was written for 'Ātmopakāra'. About 10 years later, in 1915, the Aṣṭasahasrī was also published from Bombay. It also has the Aṣṭaśatī memorized and includes many annotations. Since then, they have been the subject of my study and have solved every puzzle.

My present translation is mainly based on the Aṣṭasahasrī, for which I am very grateful to Śrīvidyānandācārya. The credit for whatever good is in my translation goes mainly to Svāmī Samantabhadra and the aforementioned Ācārya Mahādeva, who is his devoted devotee. Wherever there is any error, it is my own. I have exploited the Aṣṭasahasrī along with all the commentaries and extracted the thick butter (ghee) from it, which I have considered to be extremely useful and beneficial for my readers, and it has been compiled in the form of translation, etc. Readers who are interested in knowing very subtle things should establish their direct connection with the Aṣṭasahasrī. The meaning that naturally flows and is experienced from the original verses has been placed in black type in the form of a literal translation. The explanation of that meaning, as far as possible, has been given after a dash (-) or within two dashes, and the things that had to be taken from above to connect the statement have been placed within a circle - somewhere - 

Page #15:
---------------------------
## Chapter 14: Devagam

Another synonym for a word has also been included within the brackets. Also, in order to explain the meaning of some of the verses in more detail, explanations have been included. For example, the explanation of verse 8. More such explanations would have been good to include, but time and energy did not permit it. From this, the entire situation of the original text and the translation can be understood well.

One more thing needs to be clarified here, and that is that the **Āpta** whose examination is done in this Devagam is the **Āpta** who is the subject of the praise composed in the beginning of the **Tattvārthādhigamasūtra** as a mangalācaraṇa; as is evident from the following mangalashloka verse of Vidyānanda ji, while starting the **Aṣṭasahasrīkā**:

"**Śāstrāvatāraracitastu gocarāpta mīmāsitam kṛtir alakriyate mayā'sya.**"

Meaning, the **Āpta** who is the subject of the praise ("**Mokṣamārgasya netāram**" etc.) composed at the time of the **Tattvārthaśāstra**'s revelation, I adorn this work (**Āpta Mīmāṃsā**) by taking up the examination of that **Āpta**. Vidyānanda has further clarified this point at the end of his **Āpta Pariksha** through the following verse:

"**Śrīmattattvārthaśāstrāddhata salilnidher iddharatnodbhavasya, prottānāram bhakalē sakalamalabhide śāskārāih kṛtam yat. Stotra tīrthopamānaṁ prathita pṛthupathaṁ svāmī mīmāṁsitam tat, Vidyānandaaih svaśaktyā katham api kathitam satyavākyārtha sidhyam.**"

The essence of what is shown in this is that the **Tīrthopamāna Stotra** which was composed by the **Sūtrakara** for mangalācaraṇa at the beginning of the creation of the wonderful ocean called **Tattvārthaśāstra**, its examination was done by **Svāmī Samantabhadra**, and I have written this examination for the sake of proving the meaning of the true words.

The mangal-stotra mentioned above is the following verse: 

Page #16:
---------------------------
**Translation:**

**Anuvaadakiya**

I bow to the leader of the path to liberation, the destroyer of the karmic afflictions, the knower of all realities, for the attainment of those qualities.

This verse mentions three qualities of an Aapta (liberated soul) and praises them for the attainment of those qualities. The three qualities are: leadership of the path to liberation, destruction of the karmic afflictions (moha, etc.), and knowledge of all realities. The order in which these qualities develop in an Aapta is as follows: first, the destruction of the karmic afflictions (mountains) leading to the absence of attachment, aversion, etc.; second, the absence of knowledge-obscuring karma, etc., leading to the knowledge of all realities; and third, becoming the leader of the path to liberation as an Agamesh (revealer of scriptures). This is evident from the following verse in Swami's Saminchana Dharma Shastra (Ratnakaranda):

"One must become free from all karmic afflictions, omniscient, and a revealer of scriptures. There is no other way to attain liberation."

**Question:**

Why are the qualities of the Aapta mentioned in the above mangala stotra (auspicious hymn) in a different order, with the third quality being placed first?

**Answer:**

The Tattvartha Sutra is also known as "Moksha Shastra" (science of liberation), and it is often referred to by this name. Since this is the mangala charana (auspicious invocation) of the Moksha Shastra, the phrase "leader of the path to liberation" has been given prominence. This seems to be the reason for the change in the order of the qualities. It also clearly indicates that this is the auspicious verse of the Moksha Shastra.

**Acknowledgement:**

This translation has been carefully reviewed by Nyayaacharya Pandit Darbarilalji Jain Kothia. He has also done a lot of proofreading and provided valuable advice. I am very grateful to him for his help. He has also written a preface on the subject of this mangala charana, which has been published in various articles in Anekant Varsh 5, 6-7, and 11-12. 

Page #17:
---------------------------
The kindness shown in writing the Devagam is worthy of special gratitude. Although they have experienced an unexpected delay in writing the preface due to certain circumstances, which they have acknowledged in their publication, I believe that the publication of the book was not possible before this, and this is the reason for the delay. Thus.
I hope that the readers will now be happy to receive this translation, etc., and will forget the pain of waiting and will be able to fulfill their long-standing desire. Eta,

## Introduction to Devagam and Samantabhadra

1. Devagam: (a) Name
This work is called 'Devagam'. Ancient authors have often referred to it by this name. Akalankadeva, in the beginning of his commentary (Ashta Shatī-Bhāṣya), while promising to write his commentary on it, has given it this name and called it 'Bhagavatstava' (Praise of the Lord). Vidyānanda, in 'Ashta Sahasrī' (p. 294), while explaining the 'Svōktapariccheda' verse of Akalankadeva's Ashta Shatī, has accepted its name as 'Devagam' by saying 'Devagāmākhye Shāstre'. Vādirāja, Hastimalla, and other authors have also referred to it by this name in their works as a notable work of Samantabhadra. It is not surprising that just as 'Kalyāṇamandira',
1. 'Kṛtvā viviyate stavo Bhagavatām Devagamāstatkṛtiḥ.'
-Ashta Shatī, Initial Verse 2. 2. 'Iti Devagāmākhye Svōktaparicchede Shāstre....'
-Ashta Shatī, p. 294. 3. 'Svāminashcharitam tasya kasyano vismayāvaham | Devagamenā sarvajño yenādyāpi pradarśyate ||'
-Pārśva Ch. 4. 'Devagamanasūtrasya śrutya saddarśanānvitah.'
-Vikrant Kau. Pr. 

Page #19:
---------------------------
## Devagam - Aapta-Mimamsa

The stotra (hymn) 'Bhaktamar', 'Ekibhav', etc. are known by those names because they begin with the words 'Kalyanamandhir', 'Bhaktamar', 'Ekibhav', respectively. Similarly, this stotra begins with the word 'Devagam', and therefore it is more widely known as 'Devagam'. This is why the authors have specifically mentioned it by this name. The author of the stotra has named it 'Aapta-Mimamsa', which Akalankadev has called 'Sarvajnya-Vishesha-Pariksha'. Vidyānandan, in his works, has used both the name 'Devagam' and 'Aapta-Mimamsa'. This indicates that this work is renowned in Jain literature as 'Devagam', but also as 'Aapta-Mimamsa'. Thus, this important composition is known by both names.

(b) Introduction:

This work is divided into ten chapters, and these chapters are self-explanatory in terms of subject division, as stated by the author. The author's concept of these ten chapters reminds us of the ten chapters of Acharya Gṛddhpiṭṭhaka's Tattvartha Sutra and the ten chapters of Maharshi Kanada's Vaisheshika Sutra. The only difference is that these Sutra texts are written in prose and in the style of a treatise, while Devagam is written in verse and in a philosophical style. At that time, philosophical works were often written in the form of aphorisms and in praise of the chosen deity. The works of Nagarjuna, Vasubandhu, and other philosophers are available in this form. Samantabhadra, too, has composed his three stotras (Svayambhu, Yutkyanusasan, and Devagam) in a philosophical and aphoristic style, in keeping with the demands of the time.

## Introduction

**First Chapter:**

This text contains 114 verses divided into ten chapters. The first chapter comprises verses 1-23. Verses 1-3 discuss the characteristics that lead to the acceptance of an "āpta" (reliable authority). Verse 4 explores the possibility of an individual who is free from any flaws. Verse 5 establishes the existence of a universal "āpta" (omniscient being) through inference, based on a cause that is inseparable from the effect and free from any flaws. Verse 6 logically concludes that this universal "āpta" is the "Arhat" (liberated being), as their teachings (exposition of reality) are not contradicted by any evidence. Verse 7 describes how the teachings of those who advocate for a singular reality are contradicted by direct perception. Verse 8 explains how the teachings of those who advocate for a singular reality are contradicted by direct perception. Since they are self-contradictory, they cannot establish the nature of merit, demerit, etc. Verses 9-11, through three verses, criticize the denial of the four types of absence (prāgabhāva, pradhvamsābhāva, anyonyābhāva, and atyantabhāva) when accepting the existence of an object as solely a form of existence (vidhi). It is explained that denying prāgabhāva (prior absence) would lead to the non-existence of any production, making the effect eternal. Denying pradhvamsābhāva (absence of destruction) would lead to the non-existence of any destruction, making the object eternal. Denying anyonyābhāva (mutual absence) would make it impossible to determine "this is that, this is not that," leading to everything becoming everything. And denying atyantabhāva (absolute absence) would lead to the object losing its own distinct nature. This would completely disrupt the entire system of objects.

Verse 12 criticizes those who consider an object as solely absence (śūnya). It states that accepting an object as absence would require knowledge (bodha) to know it oneself, and means of communication (vacana) to inform others. It would also require both of these to identify and inform others about the flaws in an object that is not desired. 

Page #21:
---------------------------
## Devagam-Aapta-Mimamsa

(Bodha and Vachanaroopa) It is necessary to accept the arguments against (dushan-pramanas) which are completely impossible in absolute nihilism, because both are in the form of existence (bhav). - In the 13th, it has been shown that accepting the object as both absolute existence and absolute non-existence leads to contradiction, and accepting it as completely inexpressible (anirvachaneeya) leads to the fault of not being able to express it even with the word 'inexpressible'.

From 14-22, through 9 karikas, the object is established as anekantaatmak (multifaceted) by Syadvadnaya (relativism), meaning it possesses both existence (vidhi) and non-existence (nishedha) in contradictory pairs, making it saptabhangatmak (seven-faceted). The 23rd karika suggests applying the saptabhangi (seven-facetedness) to the object by considering contradictory pairs like one-many, eternal-non-eternal, etc.

Thus, this first chapter examines the one-sided beliefs regarding existence and non-existence that were prevalent and deeply rooted during the author's time. It also establishes the saptabhangi-anekanta by harmonizing them with the Nay-vivksha (relativistic perspective).

## Second Chapter:

The second chapter contains 13 karikas from 24-36. The first four karikas (24-27) review Advaitaikant (absolute monism) and state that accepting the object as absolutely one makes it impossible to have differences in action, differences in agents, karma-dvaita (duality of karma) in the form of merit and demerit, phala-dvaita (duality of fruits) in the form of happiness and sorrow, loka-dvaita (duality of realms) in the form of this world and the next, jnana-dvaita (duality of knowledge) in the form of knowledge and ignorance, and the two states of the soul, pure and impure, in the form of bandha-moksha (bondage and liberation). Besides this, when proving Advaita through reason, it is not only necessary but also mandatory to accept the duality of means and ends. If Advaita is accepted without reason, then duality should also be accepted without reason. Additionally, in Advaita, it is also worth considering whether the word 'dvaita' in the word 'advaita' refers to duality or not? Because the object named by a word... 

Page #22:
---------------------------
## Introduction

Negation cannot exist without accepting its existence, and accepting duality completely eliminates the acceptance of non-duality. In reality, non-duality is the negation of duality, and how can duality, which is not accepted in the absolute non-dualistic standpoint, be considered as the negation of absolute non-duality?

## Criticism of Vaisheshika's Pluralism

Through Karika 28, the Vaisheshika's pluralism, which advocates for complete duality (many), is criticized. It is argued that the quality of separateness, which is used to define substances like matter as separate (many), is either inseparable from them or separate. It cannot be said to be inseparable from them, because that is not their doctrine. If it is said to be separate from them, then that quality of separateness cannot maintain its existence, because it maintains its existence only by residing in the many. Thus, when the foundation of the Vaisheshika's pluralism (the quality of separateness) collapses, the edifice of pluralism built upon it also crumbles.

## Criticism of Buddhist Pluralism

Buddhists are also pluralists. However, their pluralism differs from that of the Vaisheshika. They do not accept a unity based on analogy, but rather accept completely separate, distinct moments as the reality. This belief is also reviewed in three Karikas (29-31). It is argued that without accepting a unity based on analogy in moments, like the thread in a garland, there cannot be progeny, similarity, community, and the state of being after death, because moments do not have a relationship of unity with each other. In addition, by considering both knowledge and the object of knowledge as different from 'being', both become non-being. And in that situation, there will be no state of knowledge, nor will there be an external and internal object of knowledge in the form of internal reality. Their position cannot be established by words either, because words refer only to the general (anvayapoha), which is non-existent, not to the particular (svalakshyatmaka vastu), and in such a situation, all words are not truly indicative of reality, and are therefore false.

## Criticism of Accepting Both Unity and Plurality

Karika 32 criticizes the acceptance of both complete unity and complete plurality (ubhaya) of reality, arguing that it leads to contradiction and inexpressibility (anubhaya). 

Page #23:
---------------------------
The term 'avachya' has been used to demonstrate the flaw in accepting the Devagam-Aaptamimansa, as it cannot be defined.

Through four karikas (33-36), the concept of Saptabhangi is established by using the Syadvadnaya (Kathanchidvad) and its expectation of the opposing pair of 'one' and 'many'. This establishes the Anekanta of 'sometimes one' and 'sometimes many' in the object.

In this way, in the second chapter, the established one-sided views of 'one' (Advaita) and 'many' (Dvaita) are criticized, and the object is proven to be Saptabhangatmak (Anekanta) in relation to this pair.

**Third Chapter:**

The third chapter contains 24 karikas (37-60). In four karikas (37-40), the one-sided eternalism of the Sankhya philosophy is criticized. It is stated that if Pradhana and Purusha are accepted as completely eternal, then there is no possibility of any kind of change in them. Because before creation, neither can be called a cause, nor can anything be called evidence before knowledge. After creation, which is the form of taking on the nature of a cause by leaving behind the nature of a non-cause, and after knowledge, which is the form of taking on the nature of a knower by leaving behind the nature of a non-knower, the behavior of a knower (evidence) occurs. Due to being one, no action like creation, knowledge, etc. is possible from the one-sided eternal (Pradhana and Purusha), and therefore it cannot be called a cause or evidence.

The belief that just as the senses express the meaning of objects like pots, in the same way, the Pradhana, as a cause or evidence, expresses the meaning of Mahat, etc., is also not justified. Because both as evidence and as a cause, Pradhana is completely eternal, so its activity for expression is also not possible. Otherwise, by leaving behind the nature of being unexpressed before expression and acquiring the state of taking on the nature of being expressed, it would have to be considered non-eternal. Therefore, Mahat, etc. cannot be expressed (changed) by Pradhana.

---------------------------
## Introduction

Just as a solitary, eternal entity cannot be the cause of any action, similarly, in the view of an eternal, unchanging soul (Purusha), neither the origin nor the manifestation of virtuous actions is possible. This is because an eternally existing entity cannot undergo any transformation, be it creation or manifestation.  Concepts like merit, demerit, rebirth (Paryayaantara), bondage, and liberation are all outcomes of change, which are impossible in the context of a solitary, eternal (Aparinaami Purusha) entity. If the eternal is always unchanging (Kutasya), then it cannot undergo any modification. Without modification, how can concepts like merit, demerit, etc., which are specific states occurring at different times, be possible? This is a point worth considering.

From verses 41 to 54, fourteen verses present arguments against the view of a solitary, non-eternal entity (Kshanikavada). It is argued that even if we accept the complete impermanence (Kshanika) of an entity, the aforementioned concepts of rebirth, etc., cannot arise. This is because, due to the lack of connection (Dhrauvyatmaka Bandhana - strong bond) between past and future moments, the flow of knowledge, such as recognition, memory, experience, desire, etc., cannot occur. In such a scenario, neither can the past moment be considered the cause nor the future moment the effect. In the view of complete impermanence, neither the origin of virtuous actions, nor the cause-effect relationship, nor the relationship of the aggressor and the victim, nor the relationship of teacher and student, nor the relationship of husband and wife, nor the relationship of mother and son, nor the state of bondage and liberation, nor the lineage of the five aggregates can be established.

Verse 55 demonstrates the contradiction in accepting both complete eternity and complete impermanence (Ubhayakaanta) and the inability to express the view of neither complete eternity nor complete impermanence (Anubhayakaanta) using the term "unspeakable."

Verses 56 to 60, through five verses, establish the seven-fold predication (Saptabhangi) of an entity as being partly eternal, partly non-eternal, partly both, partly neither, etc., using the logic of Syadvada. Thus, in this section, the seven-fold predication is presented in relation to the opposing pair of eternal and non-eternal, as in the previous sections. It is noteworthy that two important examples (worldly and transcendental) are presented...

---------------------------
**Devagam - Aapta-Mimamsa**

It is shown by the **Devagam - Aapta-Mimamsa** that both **nityata** (permanence) and **anityata** (impermanence) are present in all things. **Chapter Four:**

**8**

Chapter Four contains 12 **karikas** (aphorisms) from 61 to 72, which discuss the concepts of **bheda** (difference) and **abheda** (non-difference). The first six **karikas** (61-66) examine the **ekanta bheda** (absolute difference) view of the Vaisheshika school. It is argued that if absolute difference is assumed between the cause and effect, the quality and the qualified, and the general and the particular (**dravya-guna-karma**), then it is not possible for one (the effect, the constituent, etc.) to reside (**vriti**) in many (the causes, the constituents, etc.). This is because the question arises: does the one reside in each of the many as a part or as a whole? The first option is not correct because the one is considered to be **niransha** (without parts). The second option is also not correct because there would have to be as many effects (constituents) as there are causes (constituents). If we assume parts in the one, which is contrary to the actual principle, then how can it be called one? It should be called **sansha** (many). In this way, the **vriti** (residence) defect is inevitable in the theory of absolute difference. It cannot be overcome.

Similarly, in this theory of difference, the **samanya** (general) and **samavaya** (inherence), which are considered to be distinct substances, cannot reside in their **ashraya** (substrates). This is because the **samanya** and **samavaya** are considered to be **nitya** (permanent) and **nishkriya** (inactive), residing in each individual as a whole. Since they are inactive, they cannot move to other individuals during the destruction or creation of the perishable and impermanent individuals (like a pot, a cloth, a cow, etc.). And since they are permanent, they cannot be destroyed or created along with the individual. Therefore, ...

## Introduction

Their statement, "Both went into duality, neither Maya nor Rama was found," exemplifies the proverb. That is, both the general and the specific are wavering in discrimination. In addition, since a mutual relationship between the general and the specific is not possible, a relationship with substance, quality, and karma is also not possible. Why is a mutual relationship between the general and the specific not possible? The reason is that since they are not substances, the Vaisheshikas themselves do not accept the relationship of conjunction in them. Samvaya is also not possible in them because they are not accepted in the form of part-whole, quality-qualified, etc. The general is the universal of the specific, thus, the possibility of a qualifier-qualified relationship is also not there because the Vaisheshikas do not accept any other samvaya except one. Otherwise, it cannot be free from the fault of infinite regress. Yes, the concept of one-meaning samvaya could have been conceived, but that too cannot be done because even after the general like potness remains in the pot, etc., by samvaya, samvaya is not present in them. It is clear that the Vaisheshikas did not accept another samvaya for the existence of samvaya. They accepted only one samvaya. In this way, when a mutual relationship is not possible in both the general and the specific, they remain unconnected and cannot be related to substance, etc. As a result, all three (general, specific, and substance, etc.) remain like useless flowers without any relationship.

## On the Vaisheshika View of Atoms

Among the Vaisheshikas, some believe that cooking (combination with fire) takes place in atoms, and the resulting dyads, etc., become cooked in turn. Others do not accept cooking (combination with fire) in atoms because they believe that atoms do not undergo any kind of transformation. They only accept cooking in dyads, etc. (constituents). Those who do not accept cooking in atoms say that atoms are eternal (unchanging, unproduced, stable, and uniform). Therefore, they remain uniform in all states, from dyads onwards. They do not undergo any kind of otherness (transformation in the form of different forms). They always have non-duality (uniformity). This belief (of some Vaisheshikas) is called "the absolute non-duality of atoms" by A. Samantabhadra. 

Page #27:
---------------------------
## Chapter 10: Devagam - Aapta-Mimamsa

**It has been said and reviewed by Karika 67.** They have pointed out the flaws in this belief by stating that if the atoms, diatoms, etc., remain in the same state of aggregation as they are at the time of division (because there is no other difference in form, otherwise there would be the occasion of impermanence in them), then they will remain unmixed (unmixed - without being mixed) and in that state, the constituent earth, etc., four elements will be illusory (false). And when the constituent earth, etc., become illusory, their generating atoms also become illusory by their very nature, because the effect certainly informs about the corresponding cause. In this way, in the Vaisheshika's theory of non-dualism, neither the real earth, etc., constituent elements are formed, nor are their real cause-like atoms proven, and when neither of these two are formed, the qualities residing in them, the species (general), the special, the samvaya, and the karma, none of these substances are formed.

**Further, Karika 68 criticizes the Sankhya's theory of non-dualism (abhedaikant) by saying that if there is complete non-duality (abheda) in both the effect (mahadadhi) and the cause (praadhan), then one of them will exist, the other will be absent.** Consequently, even that one will not be able to exist in the absence of the other, being inseparable from it. In addition, in this abhedaikant, the duality of effect and cause, which is well-known in the world, will never be available. If it is accepted by convention, then that convention is false, and therefore there is no difference between convention and emptiness.

**Karika 70 shows the contradiction in accepting both complete difference and complete non-difference, and the impossibility of representing it by the word 'avachya' in accepting neither complete difference nor complete non-difference, i.e., anubhaya (avachya).**

**1. In Ashta-Sahasri (p. 222), the commentator, while commenting on the initial 'Aparaha Praah' word of the utthanika vakya of this 67th Karika, has given its meaning as 'Saugata', which is not correct.** Here, the whole context is of Vaisheshika, not of Saugatas.

## Introduction

In sections 71-72, the concept of *anekanta* (non-absolutism) is established by examining the various relationships between elements and their components, qualities and their possessors, etc. This is done by applying the seven-fold *saptabhangi* process, which demonstrates how these relationships can be characterized by both unity (non-difference) and difference (plurality).

This chapter critiques various one-sided views (like *bhedaikanta* - absolute difference, *abhedaikanta* - absolute non-difference) held by different schools of thought regarding difference and non-difference. It then establishes the *anekanta* view through the application of *syadvada* (conditional logic).

## Chapter Five

This chapter, through three *karikas* (aphorisms) 73-75, examines the views of those who assert the nature of reality based solely on dependence or solely on independence.

* **Karika 73** states that if the validity of dharma (object) and dharmi (subject), visheshana (modifier) and visheshya (modified), karya (effect) and karana (cause), and pramana (proof) and prameya (object of proof) is solely dependent, then their establishment is impossible. This is because they would be mutually dependent, like two swimmers drowning in a river, each relying on the other for support, leading to the demise of both. Conversely, if their validity is solely independent, then statements like "this is the cause of that," "this is the dharma of that," "this is the modifier of that," "this is the proof of that," and "this is the general of that" would be impossible. This is because all these relationships are established through mutual dependence.

* **Karika 74** criticizes the views of those who hold absolute dualism (*ubhayakanta*) and absolute non-dualism (*anubhayakanta*). It points out the contradiction inherent in the former and the inability of the latter to express itself using the term "anubhaya" (non-dual).

* **Karika 75** demonstrates the establishment of the nature of reality through *syadvada*. It states that the relationships of dharma-dharmi, karya-karana, visheshana-visheshya, and pramana-prameya are established through dependence. However, their nature is inherently established. In reality, the nature of effect in effect, cause in cause, proof in proof, and object of proof in object of proof is inherently established and not dependent on anything else. 

Page #29:
---------------------------
## Devagam-Aapta-Mimamsa

It is only through the principle of *anekanta* (non-absolutism) that the true nature of things can be understood. Otherwise, no object can have its own independent form. For example, the nature of the agent is not independent of the action, and the nature of the action is not independent of the agent. Similarly, the nature of the knower is not independent of the known, and the nature of the known is not independent of the knower. However, their interaction is certainly interdependent. In the same way, the nature of dharma, dharmi, etc. is self-evident, but their interaction is interdependent. Thus, in this chapter, the principle of *anekanta* is established by applying the seven-fold scheme of *saptabhangi* to the opposing pair of *apeksha* (dependence) and *anapeksha* (independence).

## Sixth Chapter

The sixth chapter, through three karikas (76-78), exposes the flaws in the absolute views of *hetuvad* (reasoning) and *ahetuvad* (non-reasoning) and establishes their harmony (anekanta-sthapan) through the application of *saptabhangi*.

Karika 76 argues that accepting the truth of objects solely through *hetuvad* leads to the absurdity of denying the knowledge of objects through direct perception and other proofs. Similarly, accepting everything as true based on *agama* (scriptural authority) leads to the absurdity of accepting contradictory principles and their corresponding elements as true.

Karika 77 demonstrates the flaws in both *ubhayakanta* (dualistic view) and *avachyatekanta* (view of the inexpressible) by showing that the term "avachya" itself cannot express the inexpressible.

The final karika (78) of this chapter, while pointing out that the truth of objects can be established through both *hetuvad* and *ahetuvad*, demonstrates the *anekanta* nature of truth through *saptabhangi*. It states that where there is no authoritative speaker, the truth of the object is established through reasoning and is called *hetu-sadhit* (reason-established). However, where there is an authoritative speaker, the truth of the object is established through their words and is called *agama-sadhit* (scripture-established). Thus, the means of establishing the truth of an object (*upaya-tattva*) - *hetuvad* and *ahetuvad* - are also *anekanta* in nature.

## Seventh Chapter

This chapter contains nine karikas (79-87) that expose the flaws in accepting individual absolute views like *jnanakanta* (absolute view of knowledge) and *bahyarthakanta* (absolute view of external objects) and establish the faultless *anekanta*. 

Page #30:
---------------------------
## Introduction

**13**

Karika 79 states that if only the knowledge principle exists and no external meaning, then all intellects and all statements would be false, because the validity of both depends on external meaning. Those whose known external meaning is true are called evidence, and those whose meaning is not true are called apparent evidence. But in the theory of knowledge-only, because external meaning is not accepted, the certainty of any intellect and any statement cannot be determined, and therefore they will be called false. And when they are false, they are included in the category of apparent evidence. But how can they be called apparent evidence without evidence? The implication is that if only the knowledge principle is accepted, then neither evidence nor apparent evidence is formed. And if they are not formed, how can knowledge alone be proved real and external meaning unreal?

Karika 80 shows the futility of trying to prove the principle of knowledge-only through the understanding of the object and the means, because such a proof leads to the fault of the proposition and the fault of the reason. It is clear that those who believe in the principle of knowledge-only have neither the object nor the reason. Otherwise, the consequence of duality would arise.

Karika 81 criticizes those who accept only external meaning and do not accept internal meaning (knowledge). It is said that if only external meaning exists and no knowledge, then there will be no doubt, no error, and no indecision. Not only that, the determination of truth and falsehood will also not be possible. Consequently, even those who advocate the opposite meaning will achieve their goals of liberation, etc. In addition, because dream intellects are not connected with self-interest, they cannot be called non-convincing.

Karika 82 shows the fault of complete dualism in the contradiction and the fault of complete non-dualism in the inability to express it with the word 'non-dual'.

Karika 83 shows that there is no fault in arranging the reality of things through Syadvada, saying that there is no need for a perception of the nature of things, because... 

Page #31:
---------------------------
## Chapter 14: Devagama-Aapta-Mimamsa

Knowledge is not a proof-like appearance (pramanaabhas). However, it is both a proof (pramana) and a proof-like appearance in relation to external objects (baahya prameya). Knowledge that becomes available after the external object is known is a proof, and knowledge that does not become available after the external object is known, but something else is found, is a proof-like appearance. In this way, all knowledge is a proof in relation to the perception of its own nature (swaroopasanvedan), and none is a proof-like appearance. But in relation to the truth of the external object, it is a proof, and in relation to its falsity, it is a proof-like appearance. Therefore, the arrangement of proof and proof-like appearance is established by accepting both the internal meaning (knowledge) and the external meaning, not by accepting only one. This is the principle of anekanta (many-sidedness) which is established by syadvad (conditional logic).

By verse 84, those (Buddhists) who do not accept external meaning, but only accept its verbal (imaginary) perception, are resolved. It is said for them that whatever word there may be, its meaning is necessarily an external object. For example, take the word 'jiva' (soul). Its meaning is necessarily an external object because it is a noun. Whatever is a noun, its meaning is necessarily an external object, just as the word 'hetu' (cause) carries its meaning, the external object of the form of a cause. It is also noteworthy that the word 'jiva' is not used in the body or in the group of senses, etc., because there is no such common usage. The common usage is fixed in the context where it is used as 'the jiva went, the jiva is present'. No one uses this in the body, because it is inanimate, nor in the senses, because they are merely means of enjoyment, nor in objects like words, because they are enjoyed. He uses 'jiva' in the soul, the enjoyer. Therefore, the word 'jiva' is associated with the external meaning of the form of jiva. Maya, avidya, aprama, etc., which are nouns indicating delusion, are also associated with their respective meanings of maya, avidya, aprama, etc. For example, the noun 'prama' (knowledge) is associated with its meaning of the form of prama. These nouns cannot be said to be merely indicative of the speaker's intention, because the rule of the listener's inclination towards that particular action after hearing those nouns (names) is observed. 

Page #32:
---------------------------
## Introduction

It is not possible. Therefore, one should not consider nouns (words) as indicative of meaning, but should accept them as indicative of truth (external meaning).

In the next three verses (85-87), the author strongly supports his aforementioned statement by stating that every object has three nouns: Buddhisanjna, Shabdasanjna, and Arthasanjna. These three nouns are respectively the speakers of Buddhi, Shabda, and Artha, and from them the listener receives three types of knowledge: reflective Buddhi, Shabda, and Artha. Therefore, the word "Jiva" is not only the speaker of Jivabuddhi or Jivashabda, but also the speaker of Jivaartha, Jivashabda, and Jivabuddhi. In reality, the three types of knowledge that are reflected in them make it clear that the three nouns have three meanings. The implication is that every object is of three types: Buddhi-atmak, Shabda-atmak, and Artha-atmak. And the three nouns that are the speakers of these three are mentioned above. In this way, all nouns (words) are with their meanings.

Although the argument (of being a noun) mentioned above is invalid for the scientist, because for him there is no noun (word) other than science. For him, the author says that when we speak, listen, or know, we are called the speaker, listener, or knower, and these three are different, not one. And the three have different functions. The speaker speaks the sentence by knowing the object, the listener listens to it and understands it, and the knower defines the object in the form of word and meaning. These three are completely different functions of the three. How can a scientist dare to misinterpret these experienced objects? In such a situation, he cannot say that the argument is invalid or has other flaws. If he calls these experienced objects (object, speaker who is the receiver of the object, and listener) as illusions, then how can his science and supporting evidence escape being classified as illusions? 

Page #33:
---------------------------
If the *Devaagam-Aapta-Mimamsa* and the evidence are mistaken, then both the desired internal object (knowledge) and the undesired external object, which are considered as evidence and non-evidence respectively, will be proven to be mistaken. In such a situation, how can the knowledge of the principle of the desirable and undesirable be possible in pure knowledge-ism?

If we say that the evidence is infallible, then the acceptance of external reality is necessary for it. Without it, the arrangement of evidence and pseudo-evidence is not possible; because only those knowledges and words have evidence which have external reality and those which do not have external reality are considered as pseudo-evidence. In reality, the intellect which obtains the known meaning is called true and the one which does not obtain the known meaning is called false. Similarly, the word which has the denoted meaning is considered true and the one which does not have the denoted meaning is considered false. Thus, the intellect and the word are called evidence and pseudo-evidence only in the existence and non-existence of external reality. This arrangement of evidence and pseudo-evidence is not possible in pure knowledge-ism. Therefore, the external reality is definitely proven in the said way and after its proof, the speaker, etc. three and their understanding, etc. three are also proven. Therefore, the said 'designation' reason is not faulty due to non-proof, etc.

Thus, in this chapter, the principle of the means of knowledge has also been made multi-faceted by planning the seven-fold theory and proved by the *Syadvada* approach.

Eighth Chapter:

This chapter contains four verses from 88 to 91. By the 88th verse, showing the fault in the acceptance of pure divineism, it has been said that if the production of desired and undesired objects is accepted only from God, then the question arises, from whom is the producer God produced? Its production cannot be accepted from human effort, because the acceptance of 'all objects are produced from God' is terminated. 

Page #34:
---------------------------
## Introduction

If its origin is attributed to another deity, then liberation can never be attained by anyone, because it would be born from a previous deity, and that previous deity would be born from an even earlier deity, and in this way, the chain of previous deities would continue indefinitely, rendering human effort futile.

The 89th Karika, while completely refuting the theory of human effort, states that if all desirable and undesirable things are solely the result of human effort, then from where does human effort originate? It cannot be said to originate from a deity, because the assertion that "all things are achieved through human effort" would be contradicted. If its origin is attributed to another human effort, then the effort of no being should be futile - everyone's effort should be successful. However, this is not observed. Therefore, just like the theory of divine determinism, the theory of human effort is also flawed and hence unacceptable.

The 90th Karika, as before, points out the contradiction in both the theories of divine determinism and human effort, and the fact that the term "experience" in the theory of experience-based determinism cannot establish its validity.

The 91st Karika establishes the validity of the theory of Syadvada in explaining the origin of things. Where the occurrence of desirable and undesirable things happens without the involvement of the intellect, their attainment is due to a deity, and where their occurrence happens with the involvement of the intellect, it is due to human effort. _Thus, in this chapter, while refuting the flaws in the theories of divine determinism, human effort, and other such singular theories, the theory of Syadvada is established as the correct explanation for the origin of things. Here too, the seven-fold predication scheme is evident. Ninth Chapter: _ This chapter examines the two aspects of the principle of divine intervention, namely, virtue and vice, and their impact on the state of beings. Virtue. 

Page #35:
---------------------------
## Chapter 18

This chapter discusses the reasons for **Devaagam-Aapta-Mimamsa** (the examination of the scriptures by the liberated soul) and the causes of **paap** (sin). This is because there are definitive beliefs regarding **punya** (merit) and **paap**.

This chapter contains four **karikaas** (verses). The 92nd **karika** examines the belief that causing suffering to others leads to **paap-bandh** (bondage of sin) and causing happiness to others leads to **punya-bandh** (bondage of merit). However, this belief is not valid because it would imply that milk and other things that cause happiness to others, and thorns and other things that cause suffering to others, would also be subject to **punya-bandh** and **paap-bandh**. If it is argued that only **chetana** (conscious beings) are subject to **bandh** (bondage), and not **achetana** (non-conscious beings) like milk and thorns, then even **vitraag** (those free from **kṣayā** (passions)) would be bound by **punya** and **paap**, because they are instrumental in causing happiness to their devotees and suffering to their non-devotees. If it is argued that they do not have the intention to cause them happiness or suffering, then the definitive belief that "causing happiness to others leads to **punya-bandh** and causing suffering to others leads to **paap-bandh**" would not hold true.

The 93rd **karika** examines the arguments of those who say that causing suffering to oneself leads to **punya-bandh** and causing happiness to oneself leads to **paap-bandh**. It is argued that if this principle is accepted, then **vitraag** **muni** (liberated sages) and **vidwaan** **muni** (learned sages) would be bound by **punya** and **paap** due to the suffering caused by **kaayaklesh** (physical pain) and the happiness caused by **tattvajnan** (knowledge of reality), respectively. As a result, they would never be able to escape the bondage of the world. Therefore, this definitive belief also does not seem to be valid.

The 94th **karika** demonstrates the contradiction in both **ubhayekant** (both-sided view) and **anubhayekant** (experience-based view), and the fact that the term "**anubhay**" cannot be used to define it.

The 95th **karika** establishes the nature of **punya** and **paap** through **syadvad** (the doctrine of maybe). It is logically argued that happiness and suffering, whether caused to oneself or others, are subject to **syadvad**. If they are caused by **vishuddhi** (purity, leading to auspicious results) or **sanklesh** (impurity, leading to inauspicious results), or if they are the cause of these results, then... 

Page #36:
---------------------------
## Introduction

From them, respectively, there is the inflow of merit (punyaasrava) and the inflow of demerit (paapasrava). If this is not the case, then the faults mentioned above are inevitable. In reality, merit and demerit are not merely caused by bringing happiness or suffering to oneself or others, but depend on their auspicious and inauspicious consequences. Those happiness and suffering that are born from auspicious consequences or are their generators, from them there is the inflow of merit, and those that are born from inauspicious consequences or are their generators, they are by rule the cause or effect of the inflow of demerit. This is the state of affairs. Thus, the system of merit and demerit is established only in Syadvada, not in Ekantvada. Chapter Ten:

In this final chapter, there are twenty karikas from 96 to 114. Through karika 96, the principle of the Samkhya philosophy, which states that "bondage is due to ignorance and liberation is due to knowledge," is reviewed. But this principle is not valid, because the objects of knowledge are infinite and therefore ignorance of some object of knowledge will remain. In such a situation, no man can ever become a Kevali. Similarly, considering liberation as being due to partial knowledge (mere discrimination between nature and the self) is also not valid, because along with partial knowledge, there will also be much ignorance. In such a situation, there will only be bondage, liberation will never be possible. Considering this, both these Ekant views are faulty and therefore not acceptable.

Through karika 97, the fault of contradiction in Ubhayakant and the inability to even indicate it through the word "unspeakable" in Avacyataikant is given.

Through karika 98, while explaining the system of bondage and liberation through Syadvada, it is said that bondage occurs due to ignorance accompanied by delusion, not due to ignorance without delusion. Similarly, liberation is possible due to partial knowledge without delusion, and not due to partial knowledge with delusion. Therefore, the cause of bondage is not only ignorance, and the cause of liberation is not only partial knowledge. In reality, bondage is established by concomitance and difference in the presence of delusion, and liberation is established in the absence of delusion. Ignorance is associated with bondage, and knowledge is... 

Page #37:
---------------------------
## Devagam - Aapta Mimamsa

**Moksha** (liberation) does not have **anvaya** (co-existence) or **vyatireka** (difference) with **anvaya vyabhichar** (deviation from co-existence) and **vyatireka vyabhichar** (deviation from difference). When there is no **anvaya vyatireka** (co-existence and difference) between them, then **karyakaranabhav** (cause and effect relationship) cannot be established. Therefore, **bandha** (bondage) due to **moha** (delusion) and **agyan** (ignorance) and **moksha** (liberation) due to even a little **gyan** (knowledge) without **moha** (delusion) should be considered as the established order.

**Karika 99** reviews the view of those who consider the diverse creations of beings, including their desires, to be the work of **Ishwar** (God). They do not accept it as a result of their **shubha** (auspicious) and **ashubha** (inauspicious) **karma** (actions). The author states that the diverse creations of beings, including their desires, are according to their own **karma** (actions), and **Ishwar** (God) is not the creator. And their **karma** (actions) are acquired through their **shubha** (auspicious) and **ashubha** (inauspicious) results, because all worldly beings are divided into two parts based on the expectation of **shuddhi** (purity) and **ashuddhi** (impurity).

The mentioned **shuddhi** (purity) and **ashuddhi** (impurity) are the powers that are **paakya** (ripe) and **apaakya** (unripe) in them, as stated in **Karika 100**.

Both are like the natural powers of beings.

**Karika 101** specifies the nature of **Jain praman** (Jain proof) and its two divisions: **akramabhavi** (non-sequential) and **kramabhavi** (sequential).

**Karika 102** points out the **pramanphal** (fruit of proof) and describes it as two types: **saakshaatphal** (direct fruit) and **paramparaphal** (traditional fruit). The **saakshaatphal** (direct fruit) of **akramabhavi** (non-sequential) **praman** (proof) is **agyannivritti** (removal of ignorance) and the **paramparaphal** (traditional fruit) is **upeksha** (absence of attachment and aversion to objects). The **saakshaatphal** (direct fruit) of **kramabhavi** (sequential) **praman** (proof) is also **agyannaash** (destruction of ignorance) and the **paramparaphal** (traditional fruit) is **hanabuddhi** (understanding of destruction), **upaadanabuddhi** (understanding of attachment), and **upekshabuddhi** (understanding of detachment).

**Karika 103** states that in every statement of the speaker, the **syat** (maybe) particle, which indicates the speaker's intention, is present either explicitly or implicitly. It acts as a **vachak** (indicator) of one **dharma** (truth) while indicating many other **dharmas** (truths) (**anekant**). This is true for ordinary speakers as well as...

## Introduction

21
Not only in sentences, but also in the sentences of Kevalis, the 'syāt' particle is inherent, and being the representative of one (intended) dharma, it reveals the existence of all other (unintended) dharmas.

In Karika 104, the same 'syāt's' argument (belief), i.e., Syādvāda, is explained. It is said that what is established by the words 'kiñcit' and 'kathañcit', which does not have the smell of singularity, and which is the establisher of the intended (upadeya) and the negator (sanmātrasūcak) of the unintended (hayas - remaining dharmas) through the seven-fold predication, is Syādvāda. Kathañcitvāda, kiñcitvāda are synonyms of this.

In Karika 105, while declaring the importance of Syādvāda, it is said that Syādvāda has the same importance in the revelation of truth as Kevalajñāna. Both are the revealers of all truths. If there is any difference between them, it is only that Kevalajñāna is the direct revealer of all truths, and Syādvāda is the indirect (parokṣa) revealer of them.

In Karika 106, it is stated that the mentioned revelation of truth happens not only through Syādvāda (śruta-ahetuvāda-āgama) but also through nay, and in nay, hetu is intended. What is the cause of the particular (dharma) of the meaning known through Syādvāda, and which has the similarity of the affirmative side and the dissimilarity of the negative side (anyathānupannatva), i.e., being inseparable from the object, is the cause of the object. The commentators have explained that the author has also mentioned the characteristics of nay in this Karika. According to their explanation, nay is that important means of knowledge of truth which makes one aware of each dharma of anekanta, which is measured by Syādvāda. The knowledge that is the receiver of the whole is pramana, and the knowledge that is the receiver of the non-whole is nay. This is the difference between the two.

In Karika 107, the nature of the Jain-accepted object (pramaya) is also described. Nay has been mentioned above. The collection (samaṣṭi) of the trikālavarti dharmas (guṇa-paryāyas) which are the subject matter of it and its divisions and sub-divisions (upanayas) is called dravya (vastu-pramaya). This collection...

## Devagam-Aapta-Mimamsa

The relationship of *samyoga* etc. is not in the form of a relationship, but rather in the form of an inseparable relationship (identity). No dharma of a substance is completely different from its other dharmas, nor is it completely inseparable. All dharmas are present in the substance with a sense of friendship, and they are all the soul (nature) of the substance. This kind of co-existent relationship is called *avishvagbhav sambandh*. A substance, while being one in relation to *satsamanya*, is also multi-faceted due to the distinction between dharma and dharmi. Or, to put it another way, it is neither completely one nor completely many, but rather a *jatyantara* form of one-many.

In *karika* 108, a solution is presented to the doubt that in Jain philosophy, the group of *ekantas* is called *anekanta*, and *ekanta* is considered *mithya* (false). Therefore, their group (*anekanta*) will also be called *mithya*. Many falsehoods cannot come together to form one truth. Therefore, the *anekanta* in the form of the above-mentioned group of *ekantas*, which has been called a substance, is not *samyak*? While resolving this doubt, the author says that if the group of absolute *ekantas* is called *mithya*, then it is acceptable to us; because in the view of the *syadvadis*, there is no absolute *ekanta* in a substance. The *syadvadis* accept relative *ekantas* and consider their group to be *anekanta*, not the group of absolute *ekantas*. They have clearly called absolute *nayas* (*ekantas*) *mithya* (false) and relative ones *vastu* (*samyak* - true), because they are the ones that are meaningful.

In *karika* 109, the nature of the speaker is also arranged from the perspective of *syadvad*. While reviewing those who consider a *vidhivakya* to be only a *vidhi* and a *nishedhavakya* to be only a *nishedha*, it is said that whether it is a *vidhivakya* or a *nishedhavakya*, both convey the knowledge of the *anekanta* nature of the substance in the form of *vidhi* and *nishedha*. When a *vidhivakya* is spoken, it not only conveys the knowledge of its intended *vidhi* dharma, but also acknowledges the silent existence of the *pratisedha* dharma - it does not convey only the knowledge of *vidhi* by negating or eliminating it. Similarly, ... 

Page #40:
---------------------------
## Introduction

A propositional sentence, even while expressing its intended prohibitive dharma, also implicitly conveys the dharma of its inseparable existence. It does not merely indicate the prohibition by negating or ignoring the latter. This is because every object possesses infinite dharmas, encompassing both "tad" and "atad" - opposing dharmas. Therefore, no sentence can arbitrarily disregard this inherent nature. However, it primarily conveys its intended meaning and secondarily the rest. To present this fact, the Syadvada philosophy asserts that the word "syat" is always present, either explicitly or implicitly, in every sentence uttered by the speaker. If a prescriptive or prohibitive sentence were only a regulator of prescription or prohibition, then the negation of the other opposing dharma would also lead to the absence of its inseparable implied dharma. Consequently, the object would become devoid of any dharma (attribute) and thus become indistinguishable (empty).

Through four karikas (verses) from 110 to 113, the author examines the beliefs of the Ekantvadins (those who hold the doctrine of one-sidedness) regarding the nature of speech and establishes the nature of speech from the perspective of Syadvada. The author states that every utterance (sentence) refers to an object in its "tad" and "atad" forms, as we have seen above. Therefore, a statement claiming "only 'tad' is the object" is not true. And when it is not true, how can the truth (the real object) be taught through false statements? The Vidhivadins (those who hold the doctrine of prescription) should seriously consider this.

The belief that every sentence only indicates "not other" is also not valid. This is because the nature of speech is to negate the meaning conveyed by other sentences while also conveying its own general meaning. Speech that does not possess this characteristic is like a flower without fragrance - false. 

Page #41:
---------------------------
## Devagam - Aapta-Mimamsa

The statement that speech only conveys the general (common) in the form of other-exclusion (anya-apoha), not the particular (svalakshana), is also not correct. Because other-exclusion, being false, cannot be the meaning of the word. The meaning of a word is that which is perceived, obtained, and towards which there is an inclination, by that particular word. Trivial other-exclusion is neither known nor obtained by any word, nor is there any inclination towards it. Therefore, it is not the denotation of the word. Since the words "pot", "cloth", etc., convey the perception and attainment of the particular objects intended by them, and the listener, upon hearing those words, has an inclination towards them, therefore, the denotation of the words "pot", etc., is the particular object intended, not the exclusion of non-pot, etc. Therefore, only those statements marked by the word "syat" are indicative and illuminating of truth. Statements not marked by the word "syat" cannot illuminate truth.

24

That which is the cause of the desired meaning and is inseparable from the prohibited (opposite) is the predicate of the word, and that is the object of injunction and its prohibited is the object of rejection. In reality, the speaker uses words to say what is desirable and to prohibit what is not desirable. And that for which the word is used is its denotation. Therefore, the other-exclusion (prohibition) of the word is complete, and the object is its denotation. Thus, denotation, etc., are inherently syadvada - not completely affirmative, nor completely negative, but both (anekanta-rupa). All things - evidence, object of knowledge, speaker, marked by the seal - are anekantarupa.

This last chapter ends with the 114th verse. In it, the author concludes the work by demonstrating the purpose of his writing. He says that he has written this Aapta-Mimamsa for those who are interested in the particles, so that they may know, have faith, and practice that the correct statement is such and such, and the false statement is such and such, and thus they may be able to determine the truth and desirability of the correct statement and the falsity and rejection of the false statement. From this, the Acharya...

## Introduction

This provides an introduction to the compassionate hearts of those who are inclined towards the welfare of others, and their high ideals such as clarity of vision, affection for the scriptures, and guidance on the path. (c) Explanations of the Devagama:

Above, some introduction to the Devagama and its subject matter has been given. Now, an attempt is made to introduce its explanations.

There are three available explanations of the Devagama: 1. Devagama-Vivriti (Ashta-Shathi-Bhashya), 2. Devagama-Alankar (Apta-Mimamsa-Alankar-Ashta-Sahasri), and 3. Devagama-Vritti. 1. Devagama-Vivriti:

Its author is Ao. Akalanka Dev. This is the oldest and most difficult explanation available of the Devagama. The concluding verses found at the end of the chapters, in which its Apta-Mimamsa is found, 

1. Ao. Vidyānanda, at the end of the Ashta-Sahasri, before the concluding benediction of Ao. Akalanka Dev, has given a concluding benediction verse of a commentator of the Devagama with the words 'Kechit' (some). From this, it appears that before Akalanka Dev, there was an explanation of the Devagama by some Acharya, which was available to Vidyānanda or he had knowledge of it, and from that, he has given the mentioned concluding benediction verse. Laghu-Samantbhadra (13th century CE) has mentioned in the Ashta-Sahasri-Tippana (101) that Vadisinha explained the Devagama (Apta-Mimamsa). But that is also unavailable today. Considering the importance and fame of the Devagama, it is not surprising that various commentaries and annotations were written on it in different times. Akalanka Dev, in the Ashta-Shathi (commentary on verse 33), has used the words 'Patha-Antar-Midam Bahu Sangrihitam Bhavati' (This variant reading is collected from many sources), clearly indicating the variant readings of the Devagama and its many explanations.

---------------------------
The commentary on the *Devāgama* by Ācārya Akalaṅka is known by three names in Jain literature: *Devāgama-vivṛti*, *Āpta-mīmāṃsā-bhāṣya* (*Devāgama-bhāṣya*), and *Aṣṭaśatī*. The verse in the third chapter of the *Aṣṭahasrī* by Ācārya Vidyānanda, which praises the text, also refers to it as *Aṣṭaśatī*. It is likely that he called it *Aṣṭaśatī* because it contains eight hundred verses. It seems that he wrote his commentary, *Devāgamālaṅkṛti*, with this *Aṣṭaśatī* in mind, making it eight thousand verses long and naming it *Aṣṭasahasrī*. Whatever the case may be, Akalaṅka's commentary is known by these three names in Jain literature. Almost every part of it is so complex and difficult to understand that ordinary scholars cannot comprehend it. Its essence and secrets can only be understood with the help of the *Aṣṭasahasrī*. It is rare to find a commentary of this kind in Indian philosophical literature. Just as the study of the *Aṣṭahasrī* is a difficult task, the study of this *Aṣṭaśatī* is also a difficult task for its students, verse by verse. 2. *Devāgamālaṅkṛti*: This is an unparalleled and important work by Ācārya Vidyānanda. It is also mentioned in literature by the names *Āpta-mīmāṃsālaṅkṛti*, *Āpta-mīmāṃsālaṅkāra*, and *Devāgamālaṅkāra*. Because it contains eight thousand verses, the author himself called it *Aṣṭasahasrī*. 3. Among all the commentaries available on the *Devāgama*, this is the most extensive and comprehensive commentary. It contains a detailed explanation of the *Devāgama*. 1. "Thus ends the tenth chapter of the *Āpta-mīmāṃsā-bhāṣya*. || 6. ||" 2. "The *Aṣṭaśatī* is well-known, and the *Aṣṭasahasrī* is a concise version of it. It should be understood with the help of the explanations given by Akalaṅka." - *Aṣṭasahasrī*, p. 178. 3. "One should study the *Aṣṭasahasrī* and understand the harmony between the present and the past." - *Aṣṭasahasrī*, p. 157.

## Introduction

This text provides a detailed explanation of the *Gamki Karikas* and their individual verses and phrases. It also presents a detailed meaning and essence of each verse and phrase in the *Ashta Shatika*. The *Ashta Shatika* has been assimilated into the *Ashta Sahasri* in such a way that if both are not kept separate in distinct types, it is difficult for the reader to know which part belongs to the *Ashta Shatika* and which to the *Ashta Sahasri*.  Vidyananda has interwoven the *Ashta Shatika* into the *Ashta Sahasri* using the *Mani-Praval* principle by adding necessary and meaningful contextual phrases before, after, and in the middle of the *Ashta Shatika*, showcasing his extraordinary brilliance.  Indeed, if Vidyananda had not composed this *Devagamalankriti*, the profound secrets of the *Ashta Shatika* would have remained hidden within it, and it would have remained mysterious for the intelligent.

In addition to the commentaries on the *Devagam* and the *Ashta Shatika*, Vidyananda has also presented many new thought-provoking propositions and unprecedented discussions. The commentator, proclaiming the importance of his commentary, wrote: "Reading and listening to a thousand scriptures is one thing, and studying this single work is another; because by practicing this alone, one gains knowledge of both this time and the next." This declaration by the commentator is neither boastful nor exaggerated. The *Ashta Sahasri* itself is its judge.

Since there are ten chapters in the *Devagam*, there are also ten chapters in the *Ashta Sahasri* as its commentary. Each chapter begins and ends with a profound verse.  *Lghusamantabhadra* (13th century) wrote a commentary called "Ashta Sahasri-Visham Padataatparyatokha" and the Svetambar scholar Yashovijay (17th century) wrote "Ashta Sahasri Taatparya Vivaran", which explain the unusual verses, phrases, and passages of the *Ashta Sahasri*. This *Devagamalankriti* was published once in 1915 by Seth Natharangji Gandhi, but it is now unavailable. Now, a second, corrected edition with modern editing should be published.

## Devagam - Aapta-Mimamsa

**3. Devagam-Vritti -** This is a concise explanation of the Devagam. It is neither as difficult as the Ashta-Shathi nor as extensive and profound as the Ashta-Sahasri. The commentary on the karikas is also not lengthy, nor is it a philosophical elaboration. Only the word-meaning and sometimes the implied meaning of the karikas and their words are presented in a very concise manner! However, this Vritti is quite useful for understanding the meaning of the karikas. Its author is A. Vasunandi, who himself wrote at the end of the Vritti that 'I am a dull-witted and forgetful person. I have written this concise description of the Devagam for my own benefit.' This clear self-introduction of the Vritti-kar reveals the brevity of this Vritti and its purpose. It is noteworthy that Vasunandi, even though he had access to the Ashta-Shathi and Ashta-Sahasri commentaries on the 114 karikas of the Devagam, and knowing the concluding mangal-padya of a Devagam-vyakhya by a previous Acharya, as mentioned by Vidyānanda in the karikas like 'Jayati Jagati', etc., on what basis did he consider the 115th karika of the Devagam and describe it? This is a matter of thought. We believe that in ancient times, there was a tradition among the sadhus of reciting the Devagam and memorizing it. Vasunandi must have memorized the Devagam from such a copy, which, along with the original 114 karikas of the Devagam, also included the concluding mangal-padya of the said unknown Devagam-vyakhya, and marked it with the number 115. Vasunandi must have written this Devagam-Vritti to memorize the meaning of the Devagam without referring to the Ashta-Shathi and Ashta-Sahasri commentaries, and in it, he must have described all (115) the memorized karikas. This is the reason...

It is stated that the present commentary does not contain any reference to the Ashta Shatika, its verses, or words, nor to the Ashta Sahasri. However, this Devagam Vritti was published once in 1914 by the Sanatan Jain Granthamala of Calcutta. It should now be reprinted in a good edition.
(d) Devagam - Basis of Composition:
After introducing the Devagam and its commentaries above, its basis of composition is also considered here.
Introduction
A. Vidyānanda holds a respected place in Jain literature and his works are considered to be like the words of an omniscient being. According to these Vidyānanda, Swami Samantabhadra composed the Devagam at the beginning of the Tattvartha Sutra for the purpose of examining the omniscient being. His references are as follows: (1) 'Shastravatara-rachita-stuti-gochara-apta-mimamsa-ishyam kriti ...... Ashta-s. Aadi-mangala-shlo. 1, p. 1.

## Devagam-Aapta-Mimamsa

These references clearly show that in the beginning of the Tattvarthashastra (Tattvarth, Tattvarthsutra, Nishreyashastra or Moksha Shastra), the author, Aacharya Umaswami, has praised the Aapta with three extraordinary epithets like "Mokshamargasya Netaram". Swami Samantabhadra has examined these epithets (Soppaatti Vicharana) in the Aapta-Mimamsa. The implication is that the Mangalastotra of the Tattvarthsutra, starting with "Mokshamargasya Netaram", is the foundation of the Aapta-Mimamsa.

The words like "Shastravatarachitastutigocaraaptamimaansitam", "Shastrakaraaih Krtam Yat Stotram...Swamimimaansitam Tat", "Shastraadou Paramesthigunastotrasya Munipungavaividhiyamaanasya...Tadanvayasyaakshepa-samaadhanaalakshanasya Shrimatsamantabhadra Swaamibhirdevaagamaakhyaaptamimaansaayaam Prakaashanaat" found in the above mentioned references of Vidyānanda are significant and deserve special attention. These words clearly declare that the Aapta-Mimamsa is an explanation of the Mangalastotra of the Tattvarthsutra.

To make his statement more substantiated and traditional, Vidyānanda has also corroborated it with the statement of Akalankadev in his Ashtshati. In this statement, Akalankadev, while answering the accusations of lack of faith and knowledge of the qualities of the Aapta made against Samantabhadra for examining the Aapta, says that the author has accepted the examination of the special qualities of the Supreme Soul, which is the subject of the praise starting with "Mokshamargasya Netaram" done in the Mangalapurvak of Devagama, etc. This automatically implies that he has both faith and knowledge of the qualities, because without either of them, the examination is not possible. It is certain that the author has followed the Shastra-nyaya (the method of the Tattvarthashastra - the creation of the Shastra with Mangalavidhanapurvak) while undertaking the creation of the Aapta-Mimamsa. This clearly shows that the author has both faith and knowledge of the qualities. The statement of Akalanka is as follows:

"Devagamaadityadimangalapurvassarasthavavishaya parmaatma gunaatishya parikshamupakshipataiva svayam shraddhaguna jnaataalakshanam prayojanam aakshitam lakshyate. Tadanvatarapyaaye arth..."

## Introduction

**Syanupapatteh**.  According to the principles of scriptures and the way it is explained, 'Astasahasri (page 2).  Vidyananda and Akalankadeva have also coordinated this exposition and their statement in the same Astasahasri (page 3) and in this way they have established the authenticity of their exposition by making it traditional. (d) 'Mokshamargasya Netaram' is the Mangalacharan of the Tattvarth Sutra.

Where it is proven by the above mentioned references of Vidyananda and Akalankadeva that Swami Samantabhadra's Aptmimamsa was written in the commentary of the 'Mokshamargasya Netaram' etc. stotra, it is also clear from the same references of Vidyananda that he considers the said stotra as the Mangalacharan of Tattvarth or Tattvarthshastra. And by Tattvarth or Tattvarthshastra, he means the Dashadhyayi Tattvarthsutra composed by Acharya Giddhapiccha.  There has been enough speculation and detailed discussion about this elsewhere. But some scholars, misinterpreting the meaning of Vidyananda's above mentioned references, attribute it to the work of Pujyapada-Devanandi, the author of Sarvarth Siddhi.

1. (a) How can Tattvarth be a scripture, if the supreme being is worshipped at its beginning?  Because it is the characteristic of the scripture.  "That is the Tattvarth scripture, which is in the form of Dashadhyayi." - Tattvarth Sutra (page 2). (b) "Thus, the Muni-Indra is the subject of the stotra at the beginning of the Tattvarthshastra." - Aptmimamsa 124. (c) When the Tattvarth, which is divided into ten chapters, is read, the result of fasting is spoken by the Muni-Pungava.

2. "Mangalacharan of Tattvarthsutra" - Title of the author's two articles, Anekanta Varsh 5, Kiran 6-7, 10-11.

---------------------------
## Devagam-Aptmimamsa

This is an attempt to prove that the renowned historian, Pandit Jugalkishorji Mukhtar, through his exploratory and diverse evidence, has established that the time of Swami Samantabhadra, which is considered to be the 2nd-3rd century Vikram Samvat, is actually the 7th-8th century Vikram Samvat.

Here, we will examine his findings in detail:

(1) Experiments conducted in Aptpariksha prove that the term "Sutrakara" was not only used for Acharya Umaswami, but also for other Acharyas.

(2) The discussion on the non-existence of the first sutra of Tattvarth Sutra in Tattvarthshloka Vartika and its solution clearly indicates that the verse "Mokshamargasya Netaram" was not present at the beginning of Tattvarth Sutra in front of Vidyānanda.

(3) Some specific mentions in Ashta Sahasri and Aptpariksha prove that Samantabhadra discussed the Apt whose subject is this verse in his Aptmimamsa.

**Review:**

These three findings are reviewed here. No evidence from Vidyānanda's works is presented in support of the first finding, where he has called any other Acharya besides Umaswami as Sutrakara or Shastrakara. The fact is that Vidyānanda has not written any other author as Sutrakara or Shastrakara except Umaswami in any of his works. Wherever he has given quotations from other authors, he has mentioned them by their names or by the name of the book or simply by saying "Taduuktam", not by the name of Sutrakara or Shastrakara. The term Sutrakara or Shastrakara is used only for Umaswami. In this regard, we have searched through Vidyānanda's works and found 33 quotations as examples... 

Page #50:
---------------------------
## Introduction
33. It is clear from the context that Vidyananda did not consider other Acharyas as Sutrakaras or Shastrakaras. He used these terms only for Umaswami. He has quoted a definition of Sutra from some source, "Sutra hi satyam sayuktikam chochyate...", with the intention of proving that the Sutras in Tattvartha Sutra are indeed Sutras according to this definition. This does not imply that he considered other authors as Shastrakaras or Sutrakaras.

The argument that the Mangalashlok is not part of Tattvartha Sutra because it is not explained by the commentators is also not valid. It is not necessary for commentators to explain the Mangalacharan of the text they are commenting on. For example, consider the second Karmagrantha, "Karmastav", and the fourth Karmagrantha, "Shadashiti", of the Shvetambar tradition. They both have Mangalacharan, but their commentators have not explained them in their commentaries. Nevertheless, these Mangalacharans are considered part of those texts. Another example is the 31 Sambandhakarikas found with the Shvetambar Tattvarthadhigam Sutra Mula. They are not explained in the Swopagna Bhashya, but are still considered to be written by the Sutrakar. The point is that commentators explain only those verses and sentences that are difficult or about which they want to say something specific. They leave the easy ones unexplainded, either by saying "Sugam" or without saying anything. The "Mokshamargasy..." shlok is also easy, hence it was not explained by the commentators. Therefore, the fact that the shlok is not explained does not prove that it was not written by the Sutrakar.

---------------------------
**Devaagam - Aaptameemaansa**

In support of this establishment, it has also been said that if Vidyānanda had intended the said Mangala Stotra to be composed by Umāsvāmī, then he would not have refuted the inconsistency by the phrase "Prabuddhaāśeṣa tattvārthe..." etc. and instead would have directly referred to it here. In this regard, we only want to ask how the establisher derived the said meaning from the verses including the said Uthānīkā phrase? Because Vidyānanda here has only presented the inconsistency arising from the context and refuted it, in which the proponent of the inconsistency has said that when there is neither a specific proponent of the path to liberation nor a specific subject matter, then the composition of the first sūtra is incongruous? While refuting this inconsistency, he says that the Muniindra (sūtrakāra) has proven by the Mangala Stotra "Mokṣamārgasya netāram" etc. that there is a specific proponent of the path to liberation and also a specific subject matter. And therefore, it is appropriate for the sūtrakāra to compose the first sūtra when the soul, possessing the nature of knowledge and perception, desires to know the path to liberation, which is conducive to future welfare. The entire passage of Vidyānanda is as follows:

"Nan ca tattvārthaśāstrasya avisūtra tāvadanupannāṁ pravaktuviśeṣasyābhāve5pi pratipādyaviśeṣasya ca kasyacitpratipitṣāyāmeva pravṛttatvādityanupattichodanāyāmuttaramāha

## Introduction

They are the same ones who are mentioned in the 'Mokshamargasya Netaram Adi Stotra' - they have translated (repeated) the same here. By the phrase 'Sidhe Muniindrasamstuty', they have made it clear that Muniindra (the Sutrakar) composed the Adi Sutra only after praising the Aapta with the aforementioned epithets. We are surprised why the mentions of Vidyānanda, which are not even remotely supportive of the establishment-maker, but are 'Swavadhay Krityotthapan' for them, are being presented.

There is no dispute in the third establishment about the statement that the aforementioned Stotra was written as an interpretation of Atma-Mimamsa. But when that Stotra is attempted to be proven by the mentions of Vidyānanda, which are not even remotely supportive of the establishment-maker's intention, to be the work of Pujyapada-Devanandika, it causes great surprise. The direct and relevant meaning of the word 'Prottanarabhakale' from the Aapta Pariksha is - at the time of the beginning of the effort or at the time of the beginning of the descent. But without accepting this direct meaning, its meaning has been interpreted as 'The meaning of the word 'Uththan' is a book, therefore the meaning of the word 'Prottan' is excellent Uththan, meaning a commentary or interpretation, therefore the meaning of 'Prottanarabhakale' is 'Vyakhyanarambhakale'. The question is how the commentary or interpretation was taken from the excellent knowledge? Because it is not supported by any dictionary or any traditional source. If Vidyānanda wanted to show the aforementioned Stotra as the commentary (Sarvarth Siddhi) of Pujyapada-Devanandika, then he would not have made such an intellectual effort and would not have confused the readers and instead of writing 'Prottanarabhakale', he could have written 'Vyakhyanarambhakale'. Similarly, instead of 'Shastrakaraiah Krtam', he could have given 'Vrittikaraiah Krtam'. This would not have caused any damage to the composition of the verse. But Vidyānanda did not want all this. He undoubtedly considered the aforementioned Stotra to be the Tattvarth Shastra and accepted it as composed by the Shastrakar - not the Vrittikar, and by Shastrakar or Sutrakar, he meant A. Giddhapiccha (Umaswami). 

Page #53:
---------------------------
The above-mentioned reference to the *mangala-sloka* in *Vidyananda's* *Tattvartha-aptamimamsa*, the statement in the *Astasahastree* " *Shastrarambhe'bhishtutasya aptasya mokshamargapranetrutvaya...* ", and the reference in *Apt-pariksha* " *Shrimadtattvarthashadbhutasalilnidheh.... proththanarambhakale 'shastrakarair krtam yat. Stotra...*, *iti tattvarthashastravo munindra stotragochara.* " clearly indicate that they consider the author of the *shastra* to be the one who composed the *mokshamargasya netaram* *stotra*, and by " *shastrakara* " they mean only the author of the *Tattvarth Sutra*, *A. Grdhapichchha*, not *Poojyapada-Devanandi*, the author of *Sarvarthasiddhi*. *Vidyananda* has used the terms " *shastrakara* " and " *sutrakar* " only for the author of the *Tattvarth Sutra* in all his works. Similarly, the terms *Tattvartha*, *Tattvarthashastra*, or *Nishreyasshastra* have also been used only for his *Tattvarth Sutra*, not in a broader or other sense, as we have seen above.

Apart from the above-mentioned references of *Vidyananda*, another very clear and unambiguous reference has been found which attributes the *mangala-sloka* to the *sutrakar* - *Grdhapichchha-Umasvami*. It is as follows: " *Grdhapichchaacharyenaapi tattvarthashastrasyadau 'mokshamargasya netaram' ityadina arhannmaaskarasyaiv parammangalataya prathamamuktatvat.* "

*Go. Ji. Ma. Pra. Ti. Pr. 14*. This reference is from *Siddhantchakravarti Acharya Abhayachandra* (12th-13th century), the author of the *Mandaprabodhika Tika* of the *Gommatasar Jivakanda*, which is seven to eight hundred years old. In it, he has clearly stated that the *mangala-stotra* was composed by *Grdhapichchhaacharya* and that it was composed by him at the beginning of the *Tattvarthashastra* (*Tattvarth Sutra*). He has not called it the *Tattvarthavrittika* of *Poojyapada-Devanandi*. This shows that even seven to eight hundred years ago, the *mangala-stotra* was considered to be the *Tattvarth Sutra* of *Grdhapichchhaacharya*. One more thing to note about this reference is that in ancient times, the *Tattvarthashastra* was referred to as the *Tattvarth Sutra*, and by that, the *Tattvarth Sutra* composed by *Acharya Grdhapichchha* was meant.

After discussing Devagam and its commentaries, we now consider its author.

**Introduction**
2. Samantabhadra:
The author of this valuable and important work is Acharya Samantabhadra, who is found adorned with the title 'Swami' in literature and inscriptions, signifying his special respect. After Acharya Kundakunda and Gṛddhpiṭcha, it was this Swami Samantabhadra who most influenced and brought fame to Jain literature. His praise is widely available in inscriptions and the works of prominent authors of literature. Akalankadeva called him the influencer of Syadvada Tirtha and the protector of the Syadvada path, Vidyānanda called him the leading proponent of the Syadvada path, Malayagiri called him the first eulogist, and inscription writers called him the one who increased the thousandfold virtues of Virashasana, the propagator of Shrutakevali lineage, the repository of all knowledge, the scholar, and the protector of the Kaliyuga. In reality, when the determination of truth became absolute and was considered as such, and the Arhat tradition, the system of truth established by the Tirthankaras like Rishabha, began to be forgotten, it was this great Acharya who revived and influenced it. Therefore, it is no surprise that such a great sage, who influenced the Shasana and spread the knowledge of truth, is praised by scholars.

A detailed introduction and determination of his time, etc., has been given by the revered Pandit Jugalkishorji Mukhtar in his historical work 'Swami Samantabhadra'. It is so well-documented, accurate, and research-oriented that even after 42 years, there seems to be no scope for revision, change, or addition. It is still completely new and thought-provoking. It contains so much material that researchers can write many research papers on it. Therefore, instead of repeating the introduction of Samantabhadra here, we will try to shed light on his achievements.

**(a) The Era Before Samantabhadra**

According to Jain scriptures, there have been twenty-four Tirthankaras in succession over vast periods of time. The first Tirthankara was Rishabhadeva, the twenty-second was Arishtanemi, the twenty-third was Parshvanatha, and the twenty-fourth was Vardhamana Mahavira. These Tirthankaras are both historical and widely known. The teachings given by these Tirthankaras are called Dvadasanga. Just as the teachings of Buddha are called Tripitaka, the Dvadasanga scriptures are divided into two parts: 1. Anga Pravist and 2. Anga Bahya. These two divisions are due to the specific speaker. The scriptures spoken by the Tirthankaras and their chief and direct disciples are Anga Pravist. And those composed by later speakers based on these are Anga Bahya. Anga Pravist and Anga Bahya are further divided into twelve and fourteen categories respectively. One of the twelve categories of Anga Pravist is Drishtivad, which is the twelfth scripture. This twelfth Drishtivad scripture presents and reviews the singular views and beliefs of various schools of thought, harmonizing them with Syadvad Nyaya. Samantabhadra has expressed this fact in his works using phrases like "Syadvadino Nath Tavaiva Yuktam" and has called all Tirthankaras Syadvadis (proponents of Syadvad). Akalankadeva has also identified them as proponents of Syadvad and their teachings as marked by the infallible seal of Syadvad.

## Introduction

Although the *Shatkhandagama* does not contain a separate discussion on *Syadvada*, the principle is definitely found in the use of the word 'Syat' (Sya). For example, while explaining humans as both sufficient and insufficient, it is stated that 'Sya Pajjata, Sya Apajjata', meaning humans are *Syat* sufficient, *Syat* insufficient. Similarly, other topics of the *agama* are also presented in this way.

In the *Agama*, Kundakunda has clearly mentioned seven types of statements for the description of *dravya* (substance), combining the two types of statements (affirmation and negation) with five other types. As stated:

"Sya Atthi Patthi Uhayam Avvattavam Puno Ya Tattiviyam. Davvam Khu Sattabhang Aavesavasen Sambhavavi."
*Panchaastikaya* Ga. 14.

This refers to the seven *bhangas* (categories of truth) and instructs us to describe *dravya* according to the *adesha* (instruction) or *naya* (perspective). Kundakunda also states that if a *dravya* is only *sadrupa* (real), then it cannot be destroyed. And if it is only *asadrupa* (unreal), then its creation is not possible. However, since we observe that a *jiva* (soul) is destroyed in the human state, born in the divine state, and remains constant as a general *jiva*, it is therefore characterized by creation, destruction, and permanence.

## Devagam-Aaptamimamsa

This suggests that during Kundakunda's time, Jain literature had begun to take on the form of philosophy, but it had not yet fully developed.  In the Tattvartha Sutra of A. Gṛddhapichcha, we find some growth in the form of philosophy presented by Kundakunda.  Firstly, he transformed the method of presenting principles in Prakrit into Sanskrit prose sutras.  Secondly, he began to present principles with reasoning.  Thirdly, he gave the term "pramana" (proof) to the knowledge of the path of knowledge, including opinions, etc., as presented in the Agamas.  He divided it into two categories: direct and indirect.  He called memory, recognition, and inference, which are accepted as separate proofs in other philosophies, "mati-jnana" (knowledge of opinion) and included them in indirect proof through the sutra "Aady Paroksham" (T.S. 1-11).  He also began new thinking by suggesting that Nayas like Naigama, etc., are means of understanding meaning.  Despite all this, the philosophy did not find a logical solution to the monisms, conflicts, and uncertainties that were the subject of discussion at that time. (b) The situation at that time:

The second and third centuries CE were a time of philosophical revolution in the history of India.  During this time, there were many revolutionary scholars in various philosophies.  In both the Shraman and Vedic traditions, there emerged rival scholars like Ashvaghosha, Matrichit, Nagarjuna, Kanada, Gautama, and Jaimini, all of whom were engaged in defending their own views and refuting those of others.  There was a flood of debates.  The main topics of discussion were the four opposing pairs: Sad-Asadvad (existence-non-existence), Shashvatvad-Uchchedvad (eternalism-annihilationism), Advaita-Dvaita (non-dualism-dualism), and Avaktvyavad-Vaktvyavad (indescribable-describable).  These were discussed in four categories.  The proponents insisted on accepting only one category (side) that they favored.  This tug-of-war led to uncertainty (ignorance).

Swayambhu. Sloka 101. 

Page #58:
---------------------------
41
The followers of Sanjaya, the Vadi, were stating the uncertainty of the Tattva. The four categories that were applied to the above pairs were as follows:
1. Sad-Asadvad
(1) Tattva is Sat. (2) Tattva is Asat. (3) Tattva is Ubhayan. (4) Tattva is Anubhayan.
2. Shashvat-Ashashvatvad
Introduction
(1) Tattva is Shashvat. (2) Tattva is Ashashvat. (3) Tattva is Ubhayan. (4) Tattva is Anubhayan.
3. Dvait-Advaitvad
(1) Tattva is Dvait. (2) Tattva is Advait. (3) Tattva is Ubhayan. (4) Tattva is Anubhayan.
4. Vaktavya-Avaktavya-vad
(1) Tattva is Vaktavya. (2) Tattva is Avaktavya. (3) Tattva is Ubhayan. (4) Tattva is Anubhayan.
1. In the Digha Nikaya Samannalamutta, Sanjaya's opinion is found as 'Amaraviksepavad'. Amar is the name of a type of fish. To have the same Viksepa (fluctuation - instability) - to believe is Amaraviksepavad.

## Devagam-Aptmimamsa
**(c) Samantabhadra's Contribution**

Samantabhadra asserted that the Tattva (Reality) does not end at the aforementioned four categories, but is complete in seven categories. He clarified that Tattva is of the nature of Anekanta (multi-faceted) - not Ekant (one-sided) - and is a collection of seven Dharmas (attributes) that come to light through the reliance on pairs of opposing Dharmas (Sat-Asat, Shashwat-Ashashwat, Ek-Anek, etc.). And such infinite collections of Sapta-Dharma (seven Dharmas) are like infinite waves in the vast ocean of Anekanta-atmak Tattva, filling it with infinite Sapta-kotis (seven categories, seven-fold predication). However, the observer must be vigilant and have a balanced perspective. They should remember that when the speaker or knower describes or understands Tattva from a particular category, that Dharma in Tattva, while present from that perspective, does not negate other Dharmas. It is merely due to the intention of the speaker.

## Introduction

The main religion is primary and other religions are secondary. To understand this, they recommended using the 'syāt' particle with each category (type of negation) and explained the meaning of 'syāt' as 'kathāñcit' - from one perspective, from one expectation. They also specified the use of the 'evakāra' word with each sentence to reveal the decisiveness of each category, so that the reality of that category is proven, not hypothetical or conventional. They also gave a new name to these seven categories of truth-presentation. That name is Bhaṅginī Prakriyā-Saptabhaṅgī or Saptabhaṅganaya. Samantabhadra's refined Saptabhaṅga is presented as follows:

1. (a) Vidhiniṣedhaśca kathāñcidiṣṭau vivakṣayā mukhyaguṇavyavasthā.

## Devagam-Aaptamimamsa
## Sad-Asadvad
(1) It may be that the truth is of the nature of being (sad). (2) It may be that the truth is of the nature of non-being (asad). (3) It may be that the truth is of the nature of both being and non-being. (4) It may be that the truth is of the nature of neither being nor non-being (avaktāvya). (5) It may be that the truth is of the nature of being and neither being nor non-being. (6) It may be that the truth is of the nature of non-being and neither being nor non-being. (7) It may be that the truth is of the nature of being, non-being, and neither being nor non-being.

In this Saptabhangi, the first bhang is with respect to the substance, space, time, and mode of the object itself (svadravyakshetrakalabhava), the second is with respect to the substance, space, time, and mode of another object (paradravyakshetrakalabhava), the third is with respect to both of these, the fourth is because both being and non-being cannot be said together, the fifth is a combination of the first and fourth, the sixth is a combination of the second and fourth, and the seventh is a combination of the third and fourth. Each bhang has a separate purpose, as is evident from the following statement of Samantabhadra:

"One may desire all things as being, due to the fourfold nature of being. Non-being is not established due to contradiction. The second bhang is due to the two extremes, and the third is due to the inability to speak together. The remaining three bhangs are due to their own reasons. In dharma, the meaning is different for each dharma, and for the infinite dharmins. The remaining bhangs are dependent on the first bhang, as the limbs are dependent on the body."

Aaptamimamsa, 15, 16, 21.

1. "Sometimes it is desired as being, sometimes as non-being. Thus, both and neither can be said, not absolutely, due to the logic of nayas."

## Introduction

Samantbhadra, like the Sad-Asadvada, also expressed his views on the one-sided doctrines of Advaita-Dvaita, Shashvata-Ashashvata, Vaktavya-Avaktavya, Anyata-Ananyata, Apeksha-Anapeksha, Hetu-Ahetu, Vigyan-Bahrirth, Daiv-Purushartha, Pap-Punya, and Bandha-Moksha-Karanavada. He established Syadvada by applying the Saptabhangi (seven categories) to these doctrines. In this way, he provided thinkers with the Syadvada perspective (method of philosophical inquiry) and played a significant role in resolving the intellectual conflicts of his time. He also created the necessary elements for philosophy, elevating Arhat philosophy not only to the level of other philosophies but also making it glorious.

The elements he created and provided to Jain philosophy are as follows:

1. The self-illuminating characteristic of proof.
2. The concept of the non-sequential and sequential aspects of proof.
3. The description of the direct and traditional fruits of proof.
4. The subject of proof.
5. The nature of Nay.
6. The nature of Hetu.
7. The nature of Syadvada.
8. The nature of the spoken.
9. The nature of the speaker.

Among these, the first three are philosophical, the fourth is poetry, and the fifth is religious.
Besides these, there are mentions of some of their works like **Jivasiddhi**, but they are unavailable.

## Conclusion
This introduction sheds light on the relationship between Devagam and Swami Samantabhadra. In this context, it also presents reflections on the interpretations of Devagam and the source of its creation. Although the introduction has become quite lengthy, the thoughts presented in it will be beneficial to the readers.

Finally, I would like to commend the translator and editor of this book, and the scholar of Jain literature and history, the venerable Pandit Jugalkishorji Mukhtar, for this translation of Devagam. By presenting a Hindi adaptation of this difficult philosophical text, Devagam, with great effort, he has greatly benefited the devotees of Samantabhadra Bharati. It is a matter of great joy that even at the age of 90, he is still engaged in government service. We wish him a hundred years of life from the bottom of our hearts.

Salutations to Shri Samantabhadra Maharshi.  With auspicious intentions, I bow to Shri Vardhamana, the embodiment of pure conduct, the one whose words are free from fault, and whose nature is pure and auspicious.  For the benefit, peace, and wisdom of the world, I explain the unparalleled *Devaagama*, a scripture of supreme knowledge, which reveals the true meaning of right and wrong teachings. This scripture is a unique work of Swami Samantabhadra. 

Page #72:
---------------------------
The first chapter, the glories of the arrival of the gods, etc., are not the reasons for your being a revered teacher. The glories of the arrival of the gods, aerial travel, and the use of fly whisks, etc., are seen even in magicians. Therefore, you are not a great being. (1) (O Veerajina!) The gods come to you on the occasion of your birth and other auspicious events, because of the arrival of the gods. You travel through the sky effortlessly, without the aid of any aircraft, because of your natural ability to do so. And the glories of fly whisks, etc., such as fly whisks, umbrellas, thrones, divine drums, showers of flowers, Ashoka trees, celestial discs, and divine sounds, as well as the other glories of the Samavasarana, manifest themselves for you or on your behalf. Because of this, you are not a revered teacher or a liberated soul for us, those who are primarily concerned with testing, even though other people in society or other worldly people may consider you a teacher, revered, or liberated because of these extraordinary glories of the arrival of the gods, etc. Because these extraordinary glories are also seen in magicians, who perform illusions like the fulfillment of desires, etc. If you are a teacher, revered, or liberated because of these glories, then those magicians are also teachers, revered, and liberated; but they are not. Therefore, the aforementioned reasons are tainted by the fault of contradiction and are therefore non-absolute reasons. They do not separate your greatness and uniqueness.

(If it is said that these Maya-vis are not truly real - they are artificial and your relationship with them is true, then who is the regulator and judge? If the Agam is said to be the regulator and judge, then the Agam is also of those Maya-vis - they, by their word-form Agam, declare those Ati-shyas to be true even though they are Maya-char-jan-ya. And if your own Agam (Jain Agam) is taken as evidence in this matter, then the said reason is Agam-ashrit, and by it alone others cannot be convinced and made to believe in the true state of affairs. Therefore, the said reason-kala-rupa reason is unable to express your greatness and Aapta-ta and is therefore, in a way, negligible for those like me.)

##  [Verse 3]

**Devagam** (divine knowledge) is found even in the gods of heaven who are overwhelmed by the **kṣayās** (afflictions) of hatred, lust, anger, pride, delusion, and greed. If this were the cause of greatness and **āptatā** (perfection), then the gods of heaven, who are attached to passion, hatred, lust, and anger, and are tainted by the **kṣayā**-faults, would also be great, worthy of worship, and perfect. But they are not like that. Therefore, even though this '**antar-bāhya-vigrahādi-mahodaya**' (greatness of inner and outer form) is not found in the illusory beings, it is present in the gods who have passion, etc., and therefore it is not a cause of distinction. Therefore, even from this, there can be no separate understanding of you, like the perfect ones.

(If it is said that the kind of **vigrahādi-mahodaya** that manifests in you due to the absence of inferior actions is not present in the gods who are attached to passion, etc., then what is the proof? The **vigrahādi-mahodaya** of both is not directly perceived, so it cannot be compared. If one's own **āgama** (scripture) is considered as proof in this matter, then this reason also becomes dependent on the **āgama**, and only from this, others cannot be convinced of the true state of affairs. Therefore, this **vigrahādi-mahodaya** reason is also incapable of expressing your greatness, and therefore it is negligible for those like me.)

**Tīrthankaratva** (being a Tīrthankara) is also not the cause of **āpta-gurutva** (perfection and being a teacher); then who is the teacher?

**Tīrthankṛtsamyānām ca paraspara-virodhatah |**
**Sarveṣām āptatā nāsti, kaścid eva bhaved guruḥ || 3 ||**

(If it is said that you are a **Tīrthankara** - the originator of the **āgama**-**tīrtha** (scripture-ford) as a means of crossing over from the world, and therefore you are great because you are **āpta**-**sarvajña** (perfect and omniscient), then this also does not seem appropriate; because other **sugatas** (liberated ones) are also called **Tīrthankaras**, and they also cross over from the world or attain liberation.

## Samantabhadra-Bharati

[ **Chapter 1**  If the propagators of the Agam Tirthas are considered to be Upayasvarupa, then they are all Aapta-Sarvajnas. Therefore, the Tirthankarattva is also tainted by the Vyabhichar-dosha. And if all the Tirthankaras are considered to be Aapta or Sarvajnas, then this also does not work; because] there is mutual contradiction in the Agamas of the Tirthankaras, which should not be the case if they are all Aapta. Therefore, due to this contradiction, the Aaptata-Nirdosha-Sarvajnatva of all the Tirthankaras is not established.

[ If it is accepted and asked whether there is any Aapta among all the Tirthankaras who are the propagators of these mutually contradictory Agamas, and if so, who is he? The answer is simply that] there may be an Aapta Tirthankara among them, and he may be the one who has achieved the full development of Chit-Chaitanya, i.e., in whom the doshas and avaranas have been completely eliminated, and pure Chaitanya has emerged.

The complete elimination of doshas and avaranas is possible due to exaggeration.
[ **Verse 4** ]  "Sometimes, just as external and internal impurities are eliminated from their causes,..."

[ If it is said that there is no such man in whom the complete elimination of doshas like ignorance, attachment, etc., and their causal karmic avaranas is possible, then this is also not correct; because] the complete elimination of doshas and their causes is seen in many men. In many men, there is a gradual decrease in doshas like ignorance, attachment, aversion, desire, anger, etc., and their causes. Therefore, it is possible for a particular man to have a complete absence of these opposing causes, just as (in gold, etc.) external and internal impurities are eliminated due to opposing causes. 

Page #76:
---------------------------
##  Karika 5

The karma-mala, which is in the form of both substance and emotion, is completely destroyed. Just as gold, bound by impurities like soot, becomes free from all external and internal impurities and transforms into its pure gold form by obtaining suitable means like fire, similarly, the bhavya jiva, bound by karma-mala, becomes free from it completely by the power of suitable means like samyag-darshan, and transforms into its pure atma form. Therefore, it is not impossible for a particular person to completely lose their faults and their causes. The person who completely loses these faults and coverings is the apt, or the faultless, omniscient, and the world-teacher.

The omniscient state is directly perceived, just as the subtle, the distant, and the hidden are perceived. The omniscient state is inferred, just as fire is inferred.

(If it is said that even after the complete loss of faults and coverings, a person cannot directly know all things related to the past and future, all present things that are very distant, and all subtle things, then that is not correct; because) subtle things like atoms, which are different in nature, distant things like Rama and Ravana, which are separated by time, and distant things like Mount Meru and the Himalayas, which are separated by space, are all inferable (the subject of inference or proof) and therefore are directly perceived by someone. 

1. The subject of proof is called 'pramaya'. According to the statement of Vasunanda Acharya, 'anumeya' means 'those who are to be known by inference are 'anumeya' and 'pramaya'. Thus, the reason for 'anumeya' is also implied in the reason for 'pramaya'. 

Page #77:
---------------------------
## Samantabhadra-Bharati
[Chapter 1: Just as fire and other substances are the subject of inference or proof, they are certainly the object of someone's direct perception. The one whose subtle, internal, and distant objects are directly perceived is omniscient. Thus, the omniscient one's correct state, arrangement, or attainment is well-established.]

"O valiant Jina! You are the faultless one, devoid of ignorance and passions like attachment, free from attachment, and omniscient - you are the very Self. Because you are 'Yukti-Shastra-Avirodi-Vak' - your speech (on any subject) does not contradict reason and scriptures. And this non-contradiction is evident in that your 'Ista' - the desired truth, the doctrine of Anekanta - is not contradicted by the 'Prasiddha' - by proof or by the established 'Ekant' of others. Whereas the 'Ista' of others (like Kapila, Sugata, etc.) - their 'Ekant' views of absolute permanence, impermanence, etc. - are contradicted not only by direct perception but also by the established 'Anekanta'. Therefore, none of the proponents of these absolute 'Ekant' views are 'Yukti-Shastra-Avirodi-Vak', and hence, none are faultless and omniscient."

"The 'Ista' of those who are completely attached to their own views, the 'Aapta's', is contradicted by proof. The 'Ista' of those who are completely 'Ekant' proponents, who are outside your nectar-like doctrine, is contradicted by perception. Those who are consumed by their own 'Aapta' pride, their 'Ista' is contradicted by what is seen." 

Page #78:
---------------------------
[Verse 7-8]

They do not accept the teachings of the Devagamas and hold aversion towards them. They are completely one-sided, in terms of their own nature, the nature of others, and in terms of rules and prohibitions. They hold and propagate only one religion, believing in eternalism and other such doctrines. They are burnt by the pride of being an "apta" (knowledgeable person), even though they are not truly "apta" or omniscient. They are like those who are burnt or scorched by the ego of "we are aptas." Their own cherished belief, which is completely one-sided, is contradicted by direct evidence. In direct perception, no object is seen as completely eternal or non-eternal, completely one or many, completely existent or non-existent, etc. Or, in other words, their belief is invalid because it is in direct conflict with the reality of objects, which is established by direct perception as being multi-faceted.

Those who are completely one-sided in their views, O valiant Lord, do not produce good or bad karma, nor do they experience the afterlife (another birth). 
Those who are attached to one-sided views, O Lord, are enemies of themselves and others. [8]

[Chapter 1 (Birth) does not even form, the fruits of good and bad karmas do not form either, and neither do bondage and liberation form - the correct arrangement of any principle or substance does not sit. And in this way, their opinion is not only directly obstructed, but it is also an obstruction to their own beloved from their own beloved.]
Explanation: In reality, every object is anekantaatmak - it has many ant-dharmas, guna-svabhavas, angas or anshas. A person who sees any object from one side, who looks at only one of its ant-dharmas or guna-svabhavas, cannot be called a samyagdrasht (one who sees-recognizes it correctly). To be a samyagdrasht, one must see the object from all sides and look at all its ends, angas, dharmas or svabhavas. A person who judges a coin by seeing only one side of it, does not understand that coin when he sees it lying on its other side, and therefore is deceived. For this reason, anekanta-drishti is called samyagdristi and ekanta-drishti is called mithyadristi.
A person who sees only one end, anga, dharma or guna-svabhavas of an object and considers it to be of that very nature - does not accept another form - and in this way creates his own ekanta-धारणा and keeps it nourished somehow, is called 'ekanta-graharakt', ekanta-pakshapaati or sarvatha ekanta-vaadi. Such people, like the blind-born men who make the law of the elephant's form, fight among themselves and become enemies of each other, where they become enemies, they consider themselves to be the elephant's 1.

[ Chapter 1

**Gives too much even.** As a result, the patients die or suffer more pain and agony, and that person, not knowing the proper use of the poison, suffers punishment due to its misuse, and sometimes even consumes the poison himself and loses his life. In this way, just as one who is obsessed with poison is an enemy to himself and others, so too should those who are obsessed with one-sidedness be considered enemies to themselves and others.

To tell the truth, those who are averse to **anekanta** are also averse to their own one-sidedness; because without **anekanta**, they cannot establish one-sidedness - without **anekanta**, the existence of one-sidedness cannot come about in the same way that the existence of the particular cannot come about without the general, or the existence of the **paryaya** cannot come about without the **dravya**. Just as the general and the particular, existence and non-existence, and eternal and non-eternal qualities are mutually interdependent, without one the other cannot exist - in the same way, there is also a mutual interdependence between one-sidedness and **anekanta**. All these qualities with their opposites exist in the same object, mutually dependent on each other. For example, the ring finger is both small and large; it is larger than the little finger and smaller than the middle finger. In this way, both smallness and largeness are relative qualities in the ring finger, or there are two interdependent qualities of smallness in the form of existence and non-existence of smallness - without relativity, neither quality exists. Similarly, each bank of a river has both the qualities of this side and that side, and they remain non-contradictory only because they are relative.

Qualities that exist in the same object, mutually dependent on each other, are beneficial (friends) to themselves and others, and they are also... 

Page #82:
---------------------------
##  Karika 8

Devaagama states that entities exist due to the existence of others. And those religions that are not mutually dependent are harmful to themselves and others (enemies), they are self-destructive, and therefore cannot sustain their own existence or that of others.  Therefore, in his *Svayambhustotra*, Swami Samantabhadra clearly states this principle through the following verses:

"Mithaanapeshah sva-para-pranashinah"
"Parasparekshah sva-paropakarinah"

You declare the absolute Nayas as false and the relative Nayas as true. In your opinion, the subject of absolute Nayas is non-existent because it is not a cause of action, while the subject of relative Nayas is real because it is a cause of action (purposeful). The subject of absolute Nayas is 'mithya ekant' and the subject of relative Nayas is 'samyak ekant'. And this 'samyak ekant' is inseparably connected with the presented anekanta. Those who are devotees of 'mithya ekant' are called 'ekantgraharavat', they are called 'sarvatha ekantvadi' and they should be considered 'sva-para-vairi' here. Those who are devotees of 'samyak ekant' are not called 'ekantgraharakt', their leader is the word 'syat', they accept that ekant in some way, therefore they are not completely attached to it, nor do they oppose or negate the opposing dharma. When considering in a relative state, there is no expectation of the opposing dharma, so there is a kind of neglect towards it, but there is no opposition or negation. And therefore, they cannot be called 'sva-para-vairi'. Therefore, Swami Samantabhadra is absolutely correct in saying that "those who are 'ekantgraharakt' are 'sva-para-vairi'."

## Samantabhadra-Bharati
[Chapter 1] Now, let's see how the system of auspicious-inauspicious karma, karma-phala, happiness-suffering, birth-death (loka-paraloka), and bondage-liberation cannot be established in the views of such self-and-other-enemy, one-sided thinkers. The matter is quite clear: since all these systems are dependent on Anekanta - without the support of Anekanta, these seemingly contradictory relative states cannot form any independent reality or system - therefore, those who are averse to Anekanta - who hold animosity towards the Anekanta principle - cannot have these systems well-established in their views. 

The denial of Anekanta leads to the denial of order-disorder; because order-disorder is inherently connected with Anekanta. When Anekanta itself is absent, how can the system of order-disorder be established? Just as there can be no system of qualities-modifications in the absence of substance, and no system of Sheesham, Jamun, Neem, Mango, etc. in the absence of a tree, similarly, there can be no system of order-disorder in the absence of Anekanta. 

The absence of the system of order-disorder leads to the denial of अर्थक्रिया (arthakriya); because अर्थक्रिया is inherently connected with order-disorder. And in the absence of अर्थक्रिया, karma, etc. cannot be established; because karma, etc. are inherently connected with अर्थक्रिया. When auspicious-inauspicious karma itself cannot be established, then how can their fruits, happiness-suffering, the realm of fruit-enjoyment, birth-death (loka-paraloka), and the matter of being bound and liberated from karma be established? 

In essence, without the support of Anekanta, all these auspicious-inauspicious karma, etc. become unsupported, and therefore, in the views of one-sided thinkers who believe in eternalism, etc., there cannot be any proper system of these. If they believe in these and want to acquire good karma through practices like penance, etc., and enjoy their good fruits, or want to be liberated from karma, then they hinder their own desires by opposing Anekanta, and in this way, they prove themselves to be self-and-other-enemies. 

Page #84:
---------------------------
[Verse 9]
Anekanta is truly the right path, it eliminates the contradictions of one-sided views like existence-non-existence, eternal-non-eternal, difference-non-difference, etc., and establishes the true nature of reality. It is the right guide for worldly conduct. Without the support of Anekanta, worldly conduct cannot be right, nor can mutual enmity and conflict be eliminated. Therefore, Anekanta is called the seed of the supreme path and the unique teacher of the world - it is the guide to the right path for all. It is also the foundation of Jain ethics. Those who truly embrace Anekanta never become enemies of themselves or others, they do not commit sins, they are not afflicted by calamities, and they always remain elevated, generous, and victorious in the world.

The flaw of Bhavaikanta is that it negates the absence of things. It considers all things to be eternally existent, without any non-existence. This leads to the loss of the characteristics of things, such as their absence in the past, absence in destruction, mutual absence, and complete absence. The loss of these characteristics makes the true nature of reality (completely) beginningless, endless, all-pervading, and formless, which is not your desire - it contradicts direct perception, etc., and is not your opinion.

(The explanation of what happens or what flaws arise from the loss of which absence is given below) 1. Anekanta, the right path, destroys the conflict of ethics and guides worldly conduct. It is the seed of the supreme path, the unique teacher of the world, and it conquers all. 

Page #85:
---------------------------
## Samantabhadra-Bharati
[Chapter 1:  The fault in denying the absence of prior existence and the absence of destruction is that the object of action would be beginningless and endless.

If the absence of prior existence is denied, then the object of action, such as a pot or sound, would be beginningless. But it is evident that everything has a beginning. If the absence of destruction is denied, then the object of action, such as a pot or sound, would be indestructible. But it is evident that everything is destructible. Therefore, denying the absence of prior existence and the absence of destruction, and claiming that the object of action is eternally unchanging, is a contradiction to experience. Therefore, denying the absence of prior existence and the absence of destruction is not appropriate. These absences must be accepted.

The fault in denying the absence of otherness and the absence of totality is that everything would be one and the same, and there would be no distinction between things.

If the absence of otherness is denied, then there would be no distinction between one thing and another. For example, there would be no difference between a pot and a cloth. But this is clearly not the case. Therefore, the absence of otherness must be accepted.

##  [Verse 11]

The proponents of the Devagam doctrine posit that their respective cherished principle, being a single entity (with the harmonious presence of undesirable elements within it), is non-dual and all-encompassing. Therefore, it cannot be categorized separately. If the complete absence of something is eliminated – the complete absence of one substance in another is not accepted – then the relationship of Samavaya (identity) between one substance and another is acknowledged. If this is the case, then there cannot be any designation (statement) of that one entity as being completely distinct, such as "this is conscious," "this is unconscious," etc.

## [Verse 12]

The doctrine of complete non-existence is flawed. Even those who advocate for complete non-existence, who claim that all things are completely unreal, have no basis for knowledge (bodha) or scripture (vakya). Without the existence of both, there can be no proof (such as self-inference, inference for others, etc.). How then can they establish their doctrine of complete non-existence and refute the arguments of those who believe in existence? Without the ability to establish their own position and refute the opposing view, the proponents of complete non-existence cannot achieve any validation or standing. Consequently, they cannot be considered omniscient or great.

## [Verse 13]

Both extremes, of complete affirmation and complete negation, are flawed. Due to contradiction, there cannot be a common ground for those who are hostile to the doctrine of Syadvada (the doctrine of maybe). Even in the case of complete silence, it is not appropriate to say that something is unspeakable.

"Samantbhadra-Bharati - [Chapter 1 (Seeing faults in both the separate beliefs of Bhavaikant and Abhavaikant)] If the unity of both Bhava and Abhava (Ubhayakant) is accepted, then it does not become unity in the eyes of the opponents of Syadvad-Nyaya; because it leads to the fault of contradiction - Bhavaikant and Abhavaikant being completely opposed to each other, unity cannot occur between them.
'(Seeing faults in the acceptance of all three Aikanta - Bhava, Abhava and Ubha) If the Aikanta of Avacyata (Avaktvy) is accepted - it is said that the reality is completely Avacy (unspeakable or Avaktvy) - then it does not become possible to say that the reality is 'Avacy' - by saying this, it becomes 'Vacy', it does not remain 'Avacy'; because in the acceptance of complete Avacy, no Vachanvyavhar can occur.
'The faultless method-system of the above Aikanta - in some way it is Sat-rupa, in some way it is Asat-rupa, in some way it is Ubhayarupa, in some way it is Avaktvyrupa (by Chakar) in some way it is Sat and Avaktvy, in some way it is Asat and Avaktvy, in some way it is Sad-Asat and Avaktvy; and all this is by the Yoga of Nayas - taking the special intention of the speaker, which is the Saptabhangatmak Nay"

"One should accept everything - the animate and inanimate, the substance and its modes, the true and the false, or even what is desirable and undesirable for oneself - as real from the perspective of the fourfold nature (svarupadi-chatushtaya) - with respect to its own substance, its own field, its own time, and its own nature.

And who does not accept everything as unreal from the perspective of the fourfold other (pararupadi-chatushtaya) - with respect to the other substance, the other field, the other time, and the other nature? - No worldly person, no examiner, no Syadvadi, no absolute monist, or any sentient being can deny this, because they are unable to eliminate perception. If someone does not accept this (even though they perceive it, but are influenced by a false understanding or prejudice), then they are not established or situated in any of their desired entities. They have no established system of entities. Because only through the establishment of accepting the own nature and rejecting the other nature, is the establishment of reality in an entity well-formed, not otherwise. If, like the own nature, the other nature is also considered real, then the implication arises that consciousness, etc., are non-conscious, etc. And if, like the other nature, the own nature is also considered unreal, then the objection of absolute nothingness arises. Or, if reality is considered in the same way as unreality, and unreality is considered in the same way as reality, then nothing..."

## 20 Samantabhadra-Bharati

[Chapter 1 is not included. Therefore, if we assume otherwise, there is no arrangement of truth or object, and this presents a serious flaw.]

**Due to the two-fold arrangement of reasons in the faultless acceptance of both and the inexpressible, duality is inseparable from the inexpressible.**
**The remaining three [categories] - the responses to the inexpressible - are broken down due to their own reasons.** || 16 ||

"The truth of the object is inexpressible due to the inability to speak about it, because it is in some way dependent on the four-fold [categories] of self, other, both, and neither, in the form of duality (both) - the form of being and non-being - or the form of existence and non-existence. And in some way, it is dependent on the four-fold [categories] of self, other, both, and neither, simultaneously. (In addition to these four) the remaining three categories - sadavaktavya, asadavaktavya, and ubayavaktavya - which are responses to being, non-being, and both, are also well-defined in some way due to their own reasons. That is, although the truth of the object is in some way unstable in relation to the four-fold [categories] of self, other, both, and neither, it is also inexpressible due to the inability to speak about it simultaneously in relation to the four-fold [categories] of self, other, both, and neither. Therefore, it is syadastyaavaktavya. Similarly, one should also know the two categories of syannaastyaavaktavya and syadasti-naasti-avaktavya."

**The dharma of existence is inseparable from the dharma of non-existence in a single dharma, because it is a qualifier. Just as a qualifier is inseparable from its opposite dharma (the dharma it qualifies).** || 17 ||

In a single dharma, the dharma of existence is inseparable from the dharma of non-existence - the dharma of existence cannot exist without the dharma of non-existence - because it is a qualifier. A qualifier is inseparable from its opposite dharma (the dharma it qualifies), just as (in the use of reason) there is samanyatva... 

Page #90:
---------------------------
## 21
**Karika 16, 17**

The relation of non-difference (anvaya-hetu) exists with the difference (vaidharmya or vyatireka hetu) - without difference (vaidharmya), there is no sameness (anvaya), and without sameness, there is no difference.

**Karika 18**

Similarly, in a single dharma, the dharma of non-existence is inseparable from its opposite (existence) - without the dharma of existence, it cannot exist - because it is a qualifier. Whatever is a qualifier is inseparable from its opposite (counterpart) dharma, just as (in the use of hetu) vaidharmya (vyatireka hetu) exists in an inseparable relation with abheda-vivaksha (sādharmya or anvaya-hetu) - without anvaya (sādharmya), there is no vyatireka (vaidharmya), and without vyatireka, there is no anvaya.

**Karika 19**

The object of speech (vishesya) is the object of both affirmation and negation - it is the object of both the affirmation of existence and the negation of non-existence, because it is the object of speech. Whatever is the object of speech is the object of both affirmation and negation. Just as the dharma of the sadhya, from one perspective, is the hetu (means), from another perspective, it is also the ahetu (non-means). For example, the sadhya...

**Chapter 1**

When the object is fiery, smoke is capable of proving it through the means of inference. When the object is watery, smoke is incapable of proving it through the means of inference. In this way, just as smoke possesses both the qualities of being a cause and not being a cause, similarly, any object that is the object of words possesses both the qualities of existence and non-existence.

**Remaining Bhangas**

The remaining Bhangas, which are Avaktavya, Asti-avaktavya, Nasty-avaktavya, and Asti-nasty-avaktavya, should also be understood through the proper application of Nayas, as explained. Just as the first three Bhangas were explained with examples, showing the inseparable relationship with their opposites due to the quality of being a qualifier, similarly, these remaining Bhangas are also worthy of being known or planned. (The arrangement of these Bhangas) O Muni-indra, the master of the Jinas, Virajinendra! There is no contradiction in your teachings (doctrine), because reality is Anekanta.

**The Meaning of a Thing**

When does a thing become capable of performing an action? And when is it not established by rules and prohibitions? It is not so, just as the action is established by external and internal characteristics. 

Page #92:
---------------------------
##  [Kārikā 20, 21] Devāgama

23. And it is not accepted that it is the doer of the action - it is the object. If this is not accepted, then the accomplishment of the action by external and internal causes, which has been accepted, does not come about - a completely real or completely unreal object is incapable of performing an action, no matter how many causes are present, and in the absence of an action, the object itself does not come about.

## [Kārikā 22]

"In the dharma-dharma, there is a different meaning for each dharma, and the main and secondary nature of the dharmas is different. Each dharma of the dharmi has a different purpose. When one dharma becomes the anga (principal) of the others, the remaining dharmas become its anga (secondary) at that time. The remaining dharmas are intended as its anga or secondary at that time."

## [Kārikā 23]

"The one who is skilled in nayas should also apply this bhāngavati (saptabhāgavati) process in the future, in the context of one-many and other alternatives, such as: the entire reality is sometimes one, sometimes many, sometimes one-many, sometimes inexpressible, sometimes one-inexpressible, sometimes many-inexpressible, and sometimes one-many-inexpressible. There is an inseparable relationship between oneness and manyness, and between manyness and oneness, and...

[Chapter 2 Therefore, without oneness, multiplicity does not arise, and without multiplicity, oneness does not arise; nor is the reality established in either complete oneness or complete multiplicity, it is unestablished in both, and only then is it the agent of action-meaning; when one dharma becomes predominant, the other dharma becomes non-predominant.]
[Further, taking the one-sided views of non-duality etc., and showing their faults, the explanation of the subject in accordance with the reality-establishment will be done.]
Thus ends the first chapter of the Devagama-Aptamimamsa.
Second Chapter
The Flaw of the One-Sided View of Non-Duality Even in the one-sided view of non-duality, the observed difference is contradictory.
The agents and actions do not arise from a single source. ||24|| 'If the one-sided view of non-duality is taken - it is assumed that reality is one and the same, completely devoid of duality (secondness) - then the difference (multiplicity) of agents and actions, which is known by direct evidence or is clearly visible and well-known (truth), is met with contradiction (becomes false). The seven agents, in the form of the agent, object, instrument, etc., which have taken on their countless and infinite differences, do not become those differences.
And neither do the actions of moving-stopping, arising-perishing, digesting-burning, contracting-expanding, eating-drinking, and seeing-knowing, etc. 

Page #94:
---------------------------
## Karika 24]

The concept of a deity as a form becomes a mere alternative; consequently, all worldly conduct is disrupted. (If it is said that the one who is one becomes transformed into various agents and actions, then it is not correct; because) the one who is one - completely alone and helpless - does not arise from itself. - Its origin and cause of birth, etc., are something else. Without the existence and cause of the other, it cannot transform itself into various agents and actions.

## Karika 25]

No duality arises in karma-phala, etc. - duality of karma, duality of fruit, and duality of the world do not exist. Duality of knowledge and ignorance, and duality of bondage and liberation do not exist. ||25|| (If the principle of complete non-duality is accepted) the pair of karma-duality - good and bad karma, the pair of fruit-duality - virtuous and sinful fruits, and the pair of world-duality - the place of experiencing fruits, this world and the next world - do not exist. (Similarly) the duality of knowledge and ignorance, and the duality of bondage and liberation do not exist. Accepting any of these dualities contradicts the absolute non-duality. And if one element of each pair is eliminated and only the other is accepted, then the elimination of the other element also becomes necessary; because without one, the other cannot exist, and in this way, all conduct is eliminated.

## Karika 26]

If the non-duality is established from the cause, etc., then there is a contradiction of duality. If the non-duality is established from the cause, then there is duality in the cause and the object. If the non-duality is established without the cause, then it is merely a matter of words, is it not? ||26|| 

Page #95:
---------------------------
## Chapter 2

**26**
**Samantbhadra-Bharati**

(Besides this, the question arises: Is the realization of non-duality achieved through a cause or simply by words without any cause? In response:) If it is said that the realization of non-duality is achieved through a cause, then the acceptance of both cause (means) and effect (goal) leads to the establishment of duality - non-duality does not remain absolute - and if realization is said to be achieved without any cause, then doesn't the mere use of words lead to duality? - The goal of non-duality and the words by which the realization of the goal is declared, both exist, and therefore non-duality does not remain. And it is not possible for something that does not exist itself to prove the existence of something else or to declare its realization. Therefore, the realization of absolute non-duality cannot be achieved in any way, it remains only a mere imagination.

**Non-duality cannot exist without duality**
*Advaitam na bina dvaitaad heturiva hetuna | Sanjnanaha pratishedo na pratisheadhyadrute kvacit ||27||*

(One more thing needs to be explained, and that is) Non-duality cannot exist without duality, just as a cause cannot exist without a non-cause; because nowhere does the negation of a named entity - the negation of something that is negated - occur without the existence of the thing being negated - the word "duality" is a named entity, and therefore the word "non-duality", which is its negation, cannot exist without the acceptance of the existence of duality.)

[Thus, the doctrines like Brahma-Dvaita, Sanvedana, and Shabdat, which advocate absolute non-duality, are found to be flawed and contradicted.]

[Kārikā 26, 27]

(Seeing faults in the Advaita Ekānta) If the Ekānta side of Pṛthaktva is taken - it is assumed that the real essence is completely different from each other - then there is also a fault in this and the question arises: are the substance and the quality separate or inseparable by the quality of Pṛthaktva? If they are inseparable, then the Ekānta of Pṛthaktva does not remain - it is obstructed. And if they are separate, then there is no quality called Pṛthaktva (which the Vaisheshikas have separately counted in the number of 24 qualities) because it is considered to be located in many while being one, and it has no separate movement - its location in a separate form is neither seen nor accepted, therefore, to say separate would be to say its absence.

[This Kārikā is spoken targeting the Pṛthaktva-Ekānta side of the Vaisheshikas and the Naiyāyikas, who respectively consider 6 and 16 substances and declare them to be completely separate from each other. In the next Kārikā, the Pṛthaktva-Ekānta side of the Kṣaṇika-Ekānta Buddhists is declared to be faulty.]

## Chapter 2: It Does Not Become All

Samantbhadra-Bharati
[Chapter 2] It does not become all - that is, the sequential flow of **paryayas** (stages of existence) with their progressive results does not occur. The simultaneous existence of **sahabhavi dharmas** (co-existent qualities) like form, taste, etc., which are produced and destroyed together, does not occur either. The unity of **sahadharmis** (co-existent qualities) with the same result does not occur, nor does dying and going to the afterlife, or a single being taking on another birth or body. Similarly, the existence of a single being in the stages of childhood, youth, and old age does not occur. And (with the use of the conjunction "cha") knowledge based on similarity and unity, like **pratyabhijnana** (recognition), does not occur either.

"If knowledge is considered completely different from the object of knowledge, both are false. If there is no knowledge, how can the object of knowledge, both external and internal, exist?

"In the opinion of the Buddhists, statements are general in meaning; because, according to their belief, they do not constitute a statement of a specific characteristic, which is the nature of a particular entity. (Since statements are only general in meaning, they do not constitute any object - they are not considered objects by the Buddhists, and in the absence of the specific, the general also does not have any existence anywhere. In this situation, the absence of the general also arises.) Due to the absence of the general as an object, all their (Buddhists') statements are false - even those statements that they present as true are not true."

"(Seeing faults in both the 'non-dual' and 'separate' ekantas individually) If the non-dual (unity) and the separate (plurality) are both considered to be one (ekanta), then this unity does not arise in the opinion of those who are hostile to the Syadvada-naya - those who do not accept the mutual dependence of opposing doctrines like non-dualism and pluralism, but accept them as independent doctrines, and thus become enemies of the Syadvada-naya. (Just as the unity of existence and non-existence does not arise); because it (like a barren woman's son) leads to the fault of contradiction - the non-dual ekanta is completely opposed to the separate ekanta, and the separate ekanta is completely opposed to the non-dual ekanta, so unity cannot occur between the two."

"(Seeing faults in the acceptance of all three ekantas - non-dual, separate, and both) If the ekantas of 'unspeakable' (avaktvyata) is accepted - it is said that the true nature is completely unspeakable (undefinable or avaktvy) in the form of unity or plurality, then the true nature..."

**[Verse 33]**

"The separateness and oneness, being independent, are non-existent due to two reasons. Separateness does not exist without oneness, and oneness does not exist without separateness. Therefore, oneness and separateness, not being opposed to each other due to their relativity, are real in the same way as the means (cause) is real due to its relativity with its own nature, existence in the similar, and difference from the dissimilar, as well as the difference in the form of affirmation and negation."

"(If it is said that due to the direct refutation of oneness and the refutation of separateness by its inherent nature, there is no object for perception, then how can oneness and separateness be experienced in all substances? This is not correct, because) from the point of view of equality in existence, all (living beings and other substances) are one. Therefore, oneness is not without an object because its object of perception is the common essence of existence.

Because all (jivadi substances) are distinct due to different expectations of the bhavas of the devas, therefore, the subject of the perception of distinctness is not the substance, etc., because of the difference in substance, etc. Just as the extraordinary cause is one from the point of view of non-duality and many from the point of view of duality, in the same way, distinctness is well-established in all substances due to the intention of difference, and oneness is well-established due to the intention of non-duality.

'(If it is said that the subject of intention and non-intention is unreal, then how can the establishment of the truth be justified on their basis? This is not correct; because) intention and non-intention, which are made in the infinite-natured qualified, are made only of the real, not of the unreal, and this is done by those who are the meaning or non-meaning of that qualifier - the meaning-seeker intends and the non-meaning-seeker does not intend. In the case of what is completely unreal, there is no meaning-seeking or non-meaning-seeking - it is like the horns of a donkey, a non-existent thing, because it is devoid of all meaning-activity.'

(O valiant Jina!) Difference (distinctness) and non-difference (oneness-non-duality) are both (dharmas) real - they are the ultimate truth - they are not the subject of convention - they are not merely imagined or conventional; because they are the object of proof - (therefore) in your opinion, they are both non-contradictory in one thing 

Page #101:
---------------------------
Samantbhadra-Bharati [ Chapter 2: The meaning of the secondary and primary is only non-contradictory - therefore, those who consider difference and non-difference to be mutually independent in their opinion, they do not obtain and form contradictions. '
(In such a situation (1) the completely different Buddhists, who accept the difference of objects as the ultimate truth - not non-difference; they consider non-difference to be conventional (imagined) truth and otherwise imagine contradiction; (2) the completely non-different Brahmavadis etc., who consider the non-difference of objects to be essential - not difference; they consider difference to be imagined and otherwise imagine contradiction between the two; (3) the completely nihilistic Buddhists, who do not accept either difference or non-difference as the ultimate truth but consider them to be the subject of conventional imagination; and (4) the dualistic Naiyayikas, who accept both difference and non-difference as truth, but consider both to be mutually independent; all four are not truthful who expound the true object-reality. From the point of view of all these, the meaning of this verse is explained as follows: _ 'Non-difference is the true nature - not the subject of convention (imagination); because it is the object of proof like difference. Difference is the true nature - not the conventional nature, because it is the object of proof, like non-difference. Both difference and non-difference are true natures - not the subject of convention, because they are the object of proof, like their desired reality; and in this way another side is also collected; because those who consider both of them to be conventional and those who consider the object to be void of all dharma (nihilists)

**Agreement is also found in the Devagama.** (Here, in the inferences of these sides, whatever examples are there are not devoid of the sadhya-sadhana-dharma; because the distinction, non-distinction, both and neither, are found in the followers of the one-sided views, like the Syadvadins.) In this way, O valiant Bhagavan! In your view, both distinction and non-distinction in one object are not contradictory in the form of ultimate truth, because they are the object of proof due to the intention of the primary and secondary, like your own desired principle. And therefore, it is also inferred with certainty that those which are absolutely distinct and non-distinct are contradictory, because they are not the object of proof, like the distinction-only view, etc.

**Thus ends the second chapter of the Devagama-aptamimamsa.**

**Third Chapter**

**The defect of the eternal-only view**

Even in the eternal-only view, change is not possible. If there are no causes, where is the proof and where is its result? ||37||

'If the eternal-only view is taken - it is assumed that the object is eternally unchanging, always remaining in the same form - then change cannot be established. Transformation from one state to another, movement, vibration, or any kind of change cannot occur in the object. The absence of causes - agent, action, instrument, etc. - is already present (before the emergence of the effect). Where there is no change of state, their existence cannot be established. 

Page #103:
---------------------------
## Samantabhadra-Bharati
[Chapter 3] When there is an absence of factors, and consequently an absence of the knower, where can proof and the fruit of proof, which is pramiti (samyagjnapti - true knowledge), be formed? - They cannot be formed. In the absence of these and the knower, the establishment of the jiva-tattva does not occur in the Sankhyas who take the side of eternalism and monism, and the arrangement of any other tattva does not sit right.

What is the reaction to the eternality of proof and factors? 
"If the proof and factors are clearly manifest, like the sense organs and their objects, and they are eternal, then what kind of transformation can there be? They are outside the bounds of your teachings." (38)

(If the Sankhya-mat-vaadis say that the unmanifest substance, which is the cause, is completely eternal, and the manifest substance, which is the effect, is not eternal, but we consider it to be non-eternal, and therefore transformation occurs in our system, then such a statement is not correct; because) just as the sense organs manifest their objects, the 'proofs and factors' by which the unmanifest is shown to be manifest, both these proofs and factors, when considered completely eternal, what kind of transformation can they produce? No action in the form of transformation can be produced by something completely eternal, nor can any non-eternal effect occur. O Sadho! - O Vira Bhagavan! - Outside the bounds of your teachings, outside the limits of the anekantavada that you have accepted, there is no place for transformation in the complete monism of eternality - the production or manifestation of non-eternal effects from completely eternal causes cannot occur, and therefore the aforementioned idea is based on delusion.

If the effect is completely real, then there is no production etc. "If the effect is completely real, then it is not worthy of being produced. The fulfillment of the result and the satisfaction of the cause are both obstacles to the monism of eternality." (39) 

Page #104:
---------------------------
[Karika 38, 39] Devagam (If the Sankhyas argue that we accept the cause-effect relationship - mahat etc. are effects and pradhan is their cause - therefore there is no obstacle in the formation of vikriya in our system, then this is an unthoughtful statement in the form of an unanalyzed principle; because there is no third movement besides these two alternatives of the existence and non-existence of the effect.) If the effect is considered to be completely real, then it does not become fit for creation like the conscious Purusha - due to being immutable, there is no such thing as creation in it, just as there is not in Purusha. In other words, what is completely real does not become an effect like consciousness, consciousness is not an effect, otherwise the effect of the Purusha, which is considered to be conscious, will also arise. Therefore, just as consciousness is not an effect due to being completely real, in the same way, the effect of mahat etc. does not arise. When there is no new creation of the effect, then how can there be vikriya? And if the effect is considered to be completely unreal, then it leads to a contradiction in the principle; because the Sankhyas, who imagine the cause-effect relationship, have considered the effect to be real - not unreal like a sky-flower. 'If it is said that the transformation, which is the change from one state to another in the object, is the effect, then this makes the object a result' and the imagination of the result in the object is an obstacle to the singularity of eternity - there is no kind of result, change or transformation in the singularity of complete eternity.

Without action, there is no afterlife, and without an afterlife, how can there be any fruit?  And without fruit, there is no bondage or liberation.  So, in the extreme view of eternalism, who would be worthy of respect, and for what reason? There is no attraction or cause for any examiner to have a respectful attitude towards it."

**Verse 41:**
"(Having seen the flaws in the extreme view of eternalism), if one takes the side of the extreme view of momentariness - relying on the Buddhists' extreme view of complete impermanence, saying that all things are destroyed moment by moment, and nothing is permanent - even then, the afterlife, bondage, liberation, and so on, are impossible. (Furthermore, knowledge like recognition, remembrance, and inference are also impossible.) Without knowledge like recognition, the beginning of action is impossible, and without the beginning of action, how can there be any fruit (in the form of happiness, suffering, merit, or demerit)?"

**37. Is it possible?** - No, it is not possible. Therefore, **Kshanikaikant** (momentary existence) is not worthy of respect for those who are examining (the truth).

**Karika 42:**
If the **karma** (action) is completely **asat** (non-existent), then it is like a flower in the sky. If **asat** is also considered to be produced, then there is no rule for the **upadan** (material cause) and there is no belief in the birth of **karma**.  (If we sow wheat, we cannot expect wheat to grow according to the rule of the **upadan** cause. Due to the production of **asat**, chickpeas, barley, or peas can also grow, and therefore we cannot be certain about any production work. All social behavior is disrupted, and this is against direct experience.)

**Karika 43:**
(Furthermore) In **Kshanikaikant**, **hetu-phal-bhava** (cause-effect-state) etc. are not formed, because there is no complete **anvaya** (connection) between them.  There is a complete **anyabhava** (difference) between them, like **santananantara** (successive births). (If it is said that the **santana** (lineage) of the previous and subsequent moments is one, then this is not correct, because what is one **santana**...)

"He is not separate from the lineage - his existence does not arise at all in a completely separate form."

"This convention of using the word 'ananya' (non-dual) in relation to others is not false. How can it be? The primary meaning is not convention, and convention cannot exist without the primary meaning." [44]

"If (from the Buddhist perspective) it is said that this use of the word 'ananya' in relation to others, which refers to completely different moments of consciousness that are called 'lineage', 'non-dual', 'indivisible', or 'one soul', is a convention - a fabrication or a formality, not real - then, being completely conventional, why is it not false? It is certainly false, and therefore, no entity like a lineage-soul can be established based on it. If the lineage is considered as the primary meaning, then the primary meaning is not completely conventional. And if it is considered as conventional, then convention cannot exist without the primary meaning - there is no possibility of formality without the primary. Just as a lion's picture cannot exist without the lion's essence."

"The Buddhist belief that the fourfold alternative is inexpressible due to its inability to encompass all aspects is incorrect. The truth of the difference between the lineage and the lineage-possessor is inexpressible." [45]

"If (from the Buddhist perspective) it is said that since the fourfold alternative is not applicable in all religions - it cannot be said about any religion that it is real, unreal, both real and unreal, or neither real nor unreal - because saying it is completely real..."

**Devaagam**

If we say that the origin of a thing is completely non-existent, then the fault attributed to the "nothingness" side arises. If we say that it is completely both (existent and non-existent), then both faults arise. If we say that it is completely experienced, then the thing becomes objectless, formless, without nature, or without any characteristics, and then the origin of any alternative does not arise. Therefore, the essence (unity-non-duality) and the otherness (diversity-duality) of those offspring and progenitors also become inexpressible (because they are dharma). Accordingly, the duality-experience dharma also becomes inexpressible (because they are dharma); because if we say that the dharma of a thing is completely non-different (inseparable) from the thing, then only the thing arises. If we say that it is completely different (separate) from the thing, then the designation does not succeed, i.e., it cannot be said that this is the dharma of that thing. If we say that it is completely both (different and non-different), then both faults arise. If we say that it is completely non-experienced (neither different nor non-different), then the thing becomes without characteristics and without nature. From this, nothing can be said about the dharma of offspring and progenitors. (Therefore, this statement is not correct; because)

"In the said acceptance of inexpressibility, the fourfold alternative of inexpressibility should not be said either. Because everything would be non-existent, without any specific characteristic or qualifier." || 46 ||

Then (to the Buddhists) "the fourfold alternative is inexpressible" should not be said either; because if we take the side of completely inexpressible (unspeakable) by showing the unsuitability of expression in all dharmas, then saying "the fourfold alternative is inexpressible" does not become possible. Saying it would lead to the possibility of expressibility, and not saying it would not make others understand it. In such a situation, its transcendence of all alternatives results. That which transcends all alternatives is devoid of all dharmas, and that which is devoid of all dharmas is non-existent (like a sky-flower); because its specific characteristic...

## Chapter 3: The Nature of Qualification

**40**
Samantbhadra-Bharati
[“Qualification does not arise, nor is it the qualified, nor the qualifier.”]
(And if it is said that the truth is manifested by self-awareness without qualification and the qualified, that is not correct; because even in self-awareness, the existence (being) of the qualified is perceived through the particularity of the qualifier. In the alternative consciousness that arises after self-awareness, the “awareness of oneself” is perceived as a qualifier-qualified relationship, not in the nature of self-awareness. If it is said that self-awareness is in the form of the unqualified and the qualifier, and that it is self-manifested, then this also proves the qualifier-qualified relationship in self-awareness; because by saying so, the unqualified and the qualifier itself becomes the qualifier.)

**47**
Negation is of the existent, not of the non-existent. Negation is of the existent, in relation to other substance, space, and time.
The non-existent is not a state, it is the place of injunction and prohibition.
(If the qualifier-qualified relationship is considered to be completely non-existent, then its negation does not arise; because) negation is of the existent (in relation to other substance, space, and time), not of the non-existent. A completely non-existent entity is not even the subject of injunction and prohibition – an entity that is non-existent in relation to other substance, space, and time, and also non-existent in relation to its own substance, space, and time, is completely non-existent. What injunction can there be for it? What has no injunction, has no negation; because negation arises after injunction. And therefore, what is existent and can be spoken of in some way in relation to its own substance, etc., is rightly considered to be unspeakable (in relation to other substance, etc.) due to its negation. And what is existent and is in some way in the form of the qualified and the qualifier in relation to its own substance, etc., is rightly considered to be in the form of the unqualified and the qualifier (in relation to other substance, etc.).

41. Therefore, Buddhists should know that no object is inexpressible or non-qualifier-qualified in isolation. ... The inexpressibility of non-existence and the non-existence of existence.

That which is devoid of all qualities is non-existent - not being the object of any proof - and that which is non-existent is (completely) inexpressible (unspeakable), not the existent; because that which exists is established (confirmed) by proof and therefore is not completely inexpressible.  _(If it is said that the non-existent, devoid of all qualities, is not accepted by the Syadvadins, then their statement that 'non-existent is inexpressible' does not seem to be justified, then it is not correct to say so; because the statement of the non-existent, devoid of all qualities, as inexpressible is related only to the hypothetical assumption, not to the strength of proof), the strength of proof is obtained only by the object, the non-existence is obtained by the object, due to the reversal or change of the process, i.e., when the process of the four characteristics of a substance, etc., of an object, which is taken in any form, changes - it takes on the expectation of another substance, field, time, and state - then that object itself becomes non-existent. For example, the non-existence of a pot in the form of a cloth, etc., in relation to the forms of the cloth, etc., in the pot, which is established by its own nature.

(If it is said that it is contradictory to call an object non-existent; because the state of existence and non-existence is mutually exclusive - existence is not non-existence and non-existence never becomes existence, then it is not correct to say so; because even by the utterance of words denoting absence, the meaning of absence is conveyed; for example, 

Page #111:
---------------------------
## Chapter 3: "Bring the Non-Brahmins"

In the phrase "Bring the Non-Brahmins," the term "Non-Brahmin" signifies the absence (negation) of Brahmin-qualities. However, it does not indicate the absence of other qualities like Kshatriya, etc., but rather their presence. Therefore, the phrase implies that "Brahmins are not being called, but Kshatriyas, etc., are." Accordingly, Kshatriyas, etc., are brought and presented.

In this way, Brahmin, being a quality, is referred to as "Non-Brahmin," implying a certain absence of that quality, not a complete absence. Therefore, the meaning of "Non-Brahmin" here should be understood as an "unintended quality." An unintended (secondary) quality cannot exist without the intended (primary) quality (the secondary is not seen without the primary), nor is it itself devoid of existence.

This is why there is no contradiction in the Jain philosophy of Syadvada in calling a quality "Non-quality" - the system of primary and secondary qualities, through the process of substance, space, time, and existence, allows for the transformation of one into the other. This is why no quality is entirely present, as it also involves the aspect of absence through its relation to other qualities; and no quality is entirely absent, as it also involves the aspect of presence through its own nature.

To consider a quality as entirely present or entirely absent would lead to a complete breakdown of the system of qualities. Every quality, like presence, also carries the aspect of absence, and this too is a part of the system of qualities. Without it, the system of qualities cannot be established. Therefore, in Syadvada, qualities are presented as having both aspects of presence and absence, depending on the perspective.

If all religions were to be considered as completely invalid, then there would be no point in discussing them: "If all were to be invalid, then what would be the point of discussing them? This is just a conventional view, contradictory to the ultimate truth." (49)

## Translation:

**[Rika 50] Devagam**

43. "If (by the momentary, solitary Buddhists) it is said that 'all religions are inexpressible' - completely beyond the reach of words, then what about their Dharma-deshana (religious discourse) - their words in the form of advocating their own side and criticizing the other side? - It cannot be formed in any way, and one will have to take refuge in silence alone; because the statement 'all religions are inexpressible' contains the fault of self-contradiction in the same way as if someone were to declare from their own mouth to others, 'I am forever silent'; because at that time they are speaking, therefore their being forever silent is itself obstructed by that very statement. If all religions are completely inexpressible, then there can be no discussion or conversation about them, it does not even become possible to call them inexpressible, calling them inexpressible also makes them expressible."

"If it is said that the aforementioned statement is in the form of *sanvṛti* - taken as a remedy for the purpose of promoting conduct, then how can the truth be established by this *sanvṛti* statement? It cannot; because *sanvṛti* is considered false even by the Buddhists themselves, being contrary to *paramārtha* - against reality. When all religions are completely inexpressible, then they cannot be made expressible even by the statement 'they are inexpressible', and neither can others be made to understand them and their inexpressibility."

[Chapter 3] Is it unutterable? - Due to what absence? - Is it unutterable due to the non-existence of the dharma of things? Or due to ignorance? - Is it unutterable due to the lack of knowledge of the dharma of things? (There cannot be any other reason besides these three; because reasons like the vow of silence, lack of purpose, fear, and shame, etc., which are the causes of the inability of the activity of sense perception, etc., are included in the inability itself.) Of these three, the statement of the two reasons of beginning and end (inability and ignorance) does not hold; because the Buddhists consider the Great Being Buddha to be omniscient in the form of Prajnaparamita and have accepted ten powers in him, namely, forgiveness, friendliness, meditation, charity, effort, conduct, wisdom, compassion, means, and joy. In such a situation, how can the statement of the said two reasons be made? It cannot be made. Then the third reason remains. Therefore, what is the point of making an excuse of unutterability? Clearly say that there is a complete absence of reality - there is no existence of any thing anywhere. By clearly saying this, there will be no fault of Maya-chara, which hinders the attainment of Buddha, and then there will be no difference between this unutterability and the complete absence, the voidism.

"In momentary annihilation, the irony of violence-nonviolence is that which is without the intention to harm harms, that which is with the intention to harm does not harm. The mind that has not intended or resolved to harm, and has not harmed, attains bondage, and the mind that attains bondage does not attain liberation. Liberation is..." 

Page #114:
---------------------------
[Verse 52]

The liberation of the unattached mind is not possible; because the mind that intends to commit violence is destroyed at the moment of intending, and in the next moment, a different mind, which has no intention, thought, or resolution of violence, performs the act of violence. Upon the immediate destruction of that violent mind, in the third moment, a third mind, which neither intended nor performed the act of violence, receives the bondage from the act of violence of the second mind. And upon the immediate destruction of that third mind, which received the bondage, it does not attain liberation from the bondage of that sinful act. Then, whose liberation is it? Does the liberation of the unattached mind become possible? It does not. Since liberation is dependent on bondage, when there is no bondage, how can there be liberation, which is the release from bondage? In this way, the destruction of the fruit of action and the enjoyment of the fruit of inaction arise in the context of the Buddhists - that is, the one who performed the action does not enjoy its fruit, and the one who did not perform the action enjoys the fruit of that action, which is a subject of ridicule. Besides this, when the liberation of the bound mind does not occur, then the practice of Yama-Niyama, etc., for liberation becomes futile.

_The destruction is considered without a cause, because the destruction is without a cause, the violence is not the cause of the violent.
The destruction of the lineage of the mind, which is considered liberation, is not based on the eightfold path._  (According to the momentary, isolated Buddhist doctrine, destruction happens on its own, it has no cause. When there is no cause for destruction, then the violent is not the cause of violence - it is not possible to call anyone violent. Similarly, the liberation that is considered to be the destruction of the lineage of the mind is not based on the eightfold path. In the Buddhist doctrine, liberation (Nirvana) is considered to be the right view, perception, perceiver, speech, body, action, effort, and mindfulness.) 

Page #115:
---------------------------
## 46 Samantabhadra-Bharati
[Chapter 3 Karma, Antarvyayam, Ajiva, Smriti, and Samadhi]

It is said that destruction is caused by these eight factors. Since it is said to be without a cause, it is as contradictory as saying that the Sugata is both omniscient and not omniscient.

If the Buddhists accept the existence of a cause for the beginning of the transformation of action, then the cause of violence is the violent (killer) and the cause of liberation is the practice of the eight limbs, such as right faith. This cause is the cause of both destruction and production, and therefore it is the support of both. Therefore, it is not different from its support, which is both destruction and production. Just as the blow of a hammer is the cause of the destruction of a pot and the production of shards, so too is the cause of both actions not different. Therefore, just as the cause of the head and the tree is the same, so too is the cause of both actions the same. This is a flaw in the Buddhist view that destruction is without a cause. If there is no cause for destruction, then there is no cause for production either. Because there is no difference between destruction and production from the point of view of action, it is not logical to say that one is without a cause and the other is with a cause.

**Explanation:** The question for the Buddhists is: If destruction is without a cause, ... 

Page #116:
---------------------------
## Karika 54:

**If there is no cause for the Devagama, which occurs spontaneously, then for whom do the causes (violent, non-violent, and the eightfold path leading to liberation) operate?**

They answer this question by saying that the causes operate for the production of dissimilar effects. But this solution is not correct; because the operation of causes is the source of both destruction and production, and the source is inseparable from its dependent, not different. This is because there is no difference between them. Just as there is no difference in the operation of causes in the case of inseparable substances. The operation of causes is not different for the inseparable substances like the Shinsapa and the tree, and the knowledge of painting and the blue, etc., colors. One group of causes leads to their self-realization. In reality, the destruction of the previous form is the production of the subsequent form. Therefore, the cause of both is the same material, not different. Otherwise, the Vaisheshika doctrine would be relevant. How surprising it is that the cause of destruction is not different from the cause of the production of dissimilar effects, so it is accepted as causeless, but the cause of production is not different from the cause of destruction, so it is not considered causeless! Therefore, since there is no difference between destruction and production, both should be considered caused or uncaused. It is not logical to consider one uncaused and the other caused.

**The aggregates, etc., do not become the cause of origination, existence, and destruction, because they are continuous and uncreated. Their origination, existence, and destruction are not like the horn of a rhinoceros.** (54)

(When the momentary, absolute Buddhists accept the coming together of causes for the beginning of a dissimilar effect, this question arises...) 

Page #117:
---------------------------
## Chapter 48: Samantabhadra-Bharati

**[The question arises: Are atomic moments or aggregates generated by a cause? The first view, that atomic moments are generated, leads to a contradiction similar to the contradiction between the established and the establisher, and the destructible and the destroyer. How can there be a generation with a cause? In the absence of cause and effect, these states, generation, and destruction, are contradictory, because atoms are indivisible. The 43rd verse already negated the existence of cause and effect in the context of momentary existence with the statement "Not because of cause and effect, nor because of other causes."  **

**Just as there is no state without an establisher, and no destruction without a destroyer, similarly, there is no generation without cause and effect. How can there be a generation with a cause? If the second view is accepted, that aggregates are generated, then aggregates are not real in the ultimate sense according to Buddhists, and are therefore uncreated and without a cause. How can there be a cause for them? In the absence of the object, there is no means. Therefore, the five aggregates of Buddhists (form, feeling, perception, volition, and consciousness) are not real in the ultimate sense, but are mere conceptual constructs. Their states, generation, and destruction are like the horn of a donkey. Just as the horn of a donkey does not exist, and therefore cannot have a state, generation, or destruction, similarly, the aggregates of form, feeling, perception, volition, and consciousness, which are composed of atoms of form, feeling, smell, and touch, are not real, but are conceptual constructs. Therefore, their states, generation, and destruction do not occur. **

**49. If they do not exist, then there is no action for them, so the concept of cause and effect is futile.**

**55.** The fault of both [the eternal and non-eternal] and the inexpressible [as sole realities] lies in their contradiction. The unity of both [eternal and non-eternal] is the hatred of the Syadvada-naya-knowers [i.e., those who reject the theory of Syadvada]. Even in the inexpressible, it is appropriate to speak of the speakable.

**(If the identity of both extremes is accepted, then both eternity and non-eternity will either become eternal or non-eternal; because in the state of identity, the contradictory situation ceases to exist and becomes a single situation. When there is only one extreme, either eternity or non-eternity, then the acceptance of both extremes simultaneously becomes contradictory.)**

**(If, out of fear of the presence of contradiction in the acceptance of both extremes of eternity and non-eternity, the extreme of inexpressibility (unspeakability) is accepted, then that too does not work; because accepting the principle of complete inexpressibility, the Buddhists, who say "the truth is completely inexpressible," face self-contradiction - just as the man who says "I am always silent" faces contradiction; because his saying so contradicts his vow of perpetual silence.)**

**56.** The faultless arrangement of the eternal and momentary extremes is that the eternal is always recognized, not suddenly and without interruption. The momentary is due to the difference in time, and the fault of the wandering of the intellect. 

Page #119:
---------------------------
## Samantabhadra-Bharati
[ Chapter 3 (O Arhan Bhagavan, the leader of Syadvada-Nyaya) ]

In your opinion, the true nature of all beings (including souls) is in some way eternal; because it is recognized - it is the same as what was seen before. This oneness of perception in the past, present, and future proves its eternality. And this recognition is not sudden, without any cause, and illusory; because it is experienced without any interruption, in an uninterrupted form. (If it is considered to be an obstacle to direct perception, then it is not correct, because the object of direct perception is the present, changing reality, and therefore it does not become a factor in the perception of oneness, which encompasses past and future changes. What is not its object, has no obstacle or supporter, like the knowledge of the eye in the knowledge of the ear.)

And in your opinion, the true nature is in some way momentary, impermanent; because it is found to change with the difference of time. The object changes from moment to moment, which are in some way different from each other. Even with this change of transformations and the continuous production and destruction of the object from moment to moment, the object never perishes due to its inherent qualities. From this perspective of transformations, the object is in some way momentary - not completely momentary. If the object is considered completely momentary and completely eternal, then the flow of knowledge will not be possible, this will be a flaw. The flow of knowledge is evident only in the acceptance of Anekanta.

Production and destruction are not of the general, but of the particular. The general does not arise, nor does it perish, because of the association with the particular. The particular arises and perishes, because it is associated with the general. (57)

(O Bhagavan!) In your opinion, the general form - all... 

Page #120:
---------------------------
##  Karika 58

**From the perspective of the substance, which is present in all states or in the states of the past, present, and future, there is neither production nor destruction.** Because the manifestation is in the form of anuvaya (inherence), the general nature of the substance, which is the nature of the substance, remains constant in all its states.

(If it is said that the cut nails and hair grow again, then there is a contradiction in the perception of anuvaya, because both production and destruction are seen in them, whereas they should not be there due to anuvaya. It is not correct to say so, because the qualifier 'vyakti' (individual) is attached to anuvaya, which indicates that it should not be contradicted by the ekatanvaya (one-ness) proof. Here, these nails, etc., are the same, which is contradicted by the ekatanvaya proof, because the produced nails, etc., are not the same but are similar to those that have been cut.)

**From the perspective of the specific state or difference, the object is destroyed and produced.** The simultaneous presence of production, destruction, and permanence in one object is called 'sat' (being), as is known from the sutrakar's statement 'utpada-vyaya-dhrauvya-yuktam sat' (being is that which is endowed with production, destruction, and permanence).

The difference of production, etc., and being independent, is the production of the object, the destruction is due to the cause, and the rule is different from the characteristic. They are not independent of the state of the species, etc., like a flower on a tree. || 58 ||

(If it is said that the production of the object is due to the cause, and the destruction is without a cause, then it is contradicted by the rule that the cause of the production of the object is also the cause of the destruction of the material cause. This contradicts the Buddhists' claim that production is caused and destruction is uncaused.) 

Page #121:
---------------------------
## 52

It is not correct to say that production and destruction have the same cause and are therefore inseparable, because production and destruction are distinct from each other due to their different characteristics. The characteristic of the cause of production is the acquisition of form, and the characteristic of the cause of destruction is the loss of nature. Thus, being characterized by different characteristics, they are distinct from each other, though not entirely different.

Due to the state of existence of things like species, destruction and production are not only different but also inseparable. For example, without clay, etc., the destruction of a pot and the production of a bowl cannot occur. Destruction and production are dependent on each other, not on the existence of the substance itself, which is the state of existence of the species, etc. The substance is clay, etc., and it is clearly seen that it is destroyed in the form of a pot and produced in the form of a bowl.

If production, destruction, and permanence are not interdependent, then all three would be like flowers in the sky, non-existent. Without permanence, there is no production; without destruction and production, there is no permanence; and without permanence and production, there is no destruction. This clearly shows that what is real is endowed with production, destruction, and permanence, otherwise it would not be real, it would be like a flower in the sky, non-existent.

## 59

(When a golden pot is broken and made into a crown) The individual who is the object of the pot experiences sorrow (grief), the individual who is the object of the crown experiences joy, and the individual who is the object of the gold experiences a neutral state, free from both sorrow and joy, due to the destruction, production, and permanence of the pot, crown, and gold respectively. 

Page #122:
---------------------------
## Karika 58]

All of this in the realm of the gods is with a cause - the cause of the sorrow of the *ghatarthi* is the destruction of the *ghata*, the cause of the joy of the *mukutarthi* is the production of the *mukuta*, and the cause of the neutral feeling of the *suvarnarthi* is the state of the gold - that which was in the form of the *ghata* is now present in the form of the *mukuta*, thus there is no cause for sorrow or joy for it. Without a cause, the sorrow etc. of those *ghatarthi*, *mukutarthi*, and *suvarnarthi* cannot arise.

(The statement of the Buddhists that there is no cause for sorrow etc., but that sorrow etc. arises only from the *vasana* of previous sorrow etc., is not correct; because even if there is only the *vasana* of previous sorrow etc. as the cause, the rule of those sorrow etc. is not possible.)

Thus, it is proven from the difference in the perception of worldly people regarding the subject of production etc., that the object is arranged in three forms - production, destruction, and permanence. Now, this subject is further clarified by another example.

## Karika 60]

"The one who has vowed to take milk - 'I will take only milk today' - does not eat yogurt, the one who has vowed to take yogurt does not drink milk, and the one who has vowed not to take *gorasa* does not eat either milk or yogurt. From this, it is known that the true nature is tripartite - simultaneously in the form of production, destruction, and permanence."

_Explanation_ - The multiplicity of perception in the same object appears to be the proof of the destruction, production, and permanence (permanence) of that object - that which is being destroyed in the form of milk is the same that is being produced in the form of yogurt and is present (permanent) in the form of *gorasa*; because milk and ... 

Page #123:
---------------------------
## Chapter 4

54.  Both curd and milk are forms of *gorasa*.  Even though *gorasa* is one, curd is not milk, and milk is not curd.  This distinction is made by practitioners of *vrat* due to their different perceptions of the substance.  If there were no three-fold perception, then the rejection of one would not lead to the acceptance of the other.

In this way, the true nature of reality, through its three-fold means, does not become subject to the opposition of eternal, non-eternal, and both.  Because in the same object, through the establishment of permanence, it is somehow eternal, and through the establishment of destruction and production, it is somehow non-eternal.  Therefore, it is rightly said that the entire group of objects is somehow eternal, somehow non-eternal, somehow both, somehow inexpressible, somehow eternally inexpressible, somehow non-eternally inexpressible, and somehow both inexpressible.  And this process of establishing the seven-fold predication should be applied in the same way as it is done for the seven-fold predication of *bhaava* etc. and *eka* etc.

Thus ends the third chapter of the *Devaagamaaptamimaamsa*.

## Chapter 4

**The complete difference of cause and effect, the distinct difference of cause and effect, the difference of quality and qualified, and the difference of the general and the particular, if these are all accepted as absolute.**

Page #124:
---------------------------
## Karika 61]

The trika of **devaagama** and **karma** is considered to be different from each other. (The obstacle that arises in this is explained further.)

**Explanation:** Here, according to the Vaisheshika school, the word "**karma**" refers to actions like walking, etc., the word "**kaaran**" refers to the cause, the word "**guna**" refers to the eternal qualities, the word "**gunee**" refers to the substance that is the support of the qualities, the word "**saamaanya**" refers to the universal, and the word "**saamaanyaavaan**" refers to the meaning of substance, quality, and karma.

The Vaisheshika school states that there is complete difference between action and the actor, between **samaavaaya** and the **samaavaayee**, between the part and the whole, between the quality and the qualified, between the attribute and the attributed, between the universal and the universalized, and between the absence and the absent. This is because they appear different, like the Sahyadri and Vindhyachala mountains.

An attempt has been made to prove this "difference in appearance" without any flaws like invalidity, contradiction, etc. In this attempt, it has also been said that the characteristics of the effect, cause, etc., are different from each other, and this difference in characteristics is the reason for the difference in appearance. If the object is one, then it will not appear different due to different characteristics. This does not contradict the reason for the difference in appearance, because the opposite, which is characterized by different characteristics, lacks existence in it.

Another point that has been made is that those who believe that the effect and cause, the quality and the qualified, and the universal and the universalized are identical, are wrong. This is because their **desha** (field) is not different. Those who are not identical, their **desha** is not different, like the Sahyadri and Vindhyachala mountains. The **desha** of the effect, cause, etc., is the same. Therefore, they are identical. And through this inference, they conclude that the effect, cause, etc., are...

It is not correct to state that the principle of distinctness is absolute. This is because there are two types of non-differentiation: one is scriptural and the other is worldly. The scriptural non-differentiation of cause and effect, etc., is not valid. From the perspective of scripture, the cloth, etc., as an effect, has its own cause, the group of threads, and the threads have their own cause, cotton, etc. In this way, everything is differentiated from its own cause and effect. The worldly non-differentiation of space, soul, etc., is flawed because it leads to contradiction. Even though space and soul, etc., do not have distinct locations from the perspective of the worldly, they are not identical.

## 1
## Flaws in the aforementioned principle of distinctness

If one thing has multiple functions, it is not due to the absence of parts, nor is it due to the presence of multiple parts. If it is due to the presence of parts, then its oneness is not established. This is a flaw in the function, as it is not appropriate. || 62 ||

(If, according to the Vaisheshika school of thought, cause and effect, quality and qualified, and universal and particular are considered to be completely distinct from each other, then) the function of one - the cloth, etc., as an effect, in the form of its constituent parts, in the many - the cause, etc. - does not arise. This is because the absence of parts in that one thing implies that it is without parts, while it should have parts. Otherwise, the contradiction between cause and effect, etc., will arise in the same way as the contradiction between the non-cause and effect relationship of the thread and the pot, and the clay and the pot. If the function of one (constituent parts, etc.) is considered to be based on the parts, then the oneness of that one thing is not established. It becomes divided and transformed into many forms. Besides this, the question arises: does the function of one in many occur with respect to the characteristics of the thread, etc., as a basis, in a single location, or in a universal way? It does not occur in a single location, because the cloth, etc., as an effect, is without a specific location, and therefore the thread... 

Page #126:

## Devagam Karika 63:

**It is not possible for a single entity to be present in multiple locations simultaneously, and if it were to be present in all locations, then the concept of multiplicity of parts would arise.**  For example, if there are multiple parts, then there would be multiple parts, and if there are multiple qualities like conjunction, then there would be multiple qualities present in multiple parts. Similarly, if there are multiple entities with common characteristics, then they should all be common. However, this is not the case. Therefore, assuming that a single entity is present in multiple locations simultaneously, or that it is present in all locations, leads to contradictions in the Arhat path, which is completely distinct from other paths. In this way, both accepting and rejecting the presence of a single entity in multiple locations leads to contradictions. There is no other type of presence besides being present in a specific location or being present in all locations.

**(If, according to the Vaisheshika philosophy, the relationship of Samavaya is considered as a different type of relationship, and it is said that the presence of parts, etc., in the whole, etc., is due to the relationship of Samavaya, and that without the relationship of Samavaya, there is no meaning of presence, then this is also not correct. Because the same question arises here: Is the presence of Samavaya in the whole, etc., in the parts, etc., specific or universal? And accepting either type of Samavaya presence leads to the same contradictions mentioned above.)**

**Even if we consider the difference between parts, etc., and the whole, etc., to be absolute, then we would have to accept a difference between them in terms of space and time.** This would lead to the acceptance of presence (Samavaya relationship) in separate locations, like the presence of a pot and a tree in separate locations, which are both considered to be separate entities.

(Result) The sameness (non-difference) of location and time, which is seen in the cause and effect of a form, will not be able to form. _ Explanation - If one assumes a complete difference between the constituent and the constituted, etc., then one will have to assume a difference in location and time between them, and their relationship will be like that of the yut-siddhas; then how can non-difference of location be formed in them? This is something for the Vaisheshikas to think about.  Although there is a great difference between the soul and space, there is neither a difference in location nor in time between them, and therefore this great difference is not a regulator of the difference in location and time of cause and effect. However, the great difference between the soul and space in terms of being, substance, etc., is not established. Therefore, there is no obstacle to their being non-different in location and non-different in time.

'If it is said that in the samavayis - the constituent-constituted (thread-cloth) etc. - there is no independence due to the aashraya-aashrayi-bhavana (relationship of dependence) by the samavaya, which would lead to the formation of vritti (samavaya-relationship-functioning) even when there is a difference in location and time, then this is not correct. (Because then the question arises whether that samavaya is self-related in the samavayis or related by another samavaya. If it is self-related, then the constituted will also be self-related in its constituents, what is the result of the unnecessary assumption of a separate samavaya for it? If it is related by another samavaya, then that other samavaya will also have to be considered related to another third, and the third to another fourth, and in this way, the assumption of many samavayas will lead to an infinite regress.

## Karika 65:

**Devaagam**

If it is said that Samavaya, being independent, does not require any other relation, but remains unconnected, then this is not appropriate; because how can that which is itself unconnected (without relation) establish a relation between one (component) and another (component)? How can it remain with another (substance, etc.) in a state of being unconnected? It cannot.

**Verse 65:**

"Just as a general principle cannot exist without a substratum, so also Samavaya cannot exist without a substratum. When both the general principle and Samavaya are fully realized in each eternal individual substance, how can their harmonious existence be established in the case of impermanent actions that are destroyed and produced? - It cannot be established."

**Explanation:**

Where there is the production of an individual, there is neither a general principle nor Samavaya beforehand; because they have no substratum there, and both of them cannot exist without a substratum. Otherwise, the possibility of being without a substratum will arise. It is also not possible that they come from another individual in a complete or partial form; because there will be a lack of a foundation and the possibility of partiality in the general principle and Samavaya. Their own production later is also not possible, otherwise they will be considered impermanent. Even when the substratum is destroyed, they are not destroyed; because they are eternal and surprisingly, they are fully present in each. In short, both the general principle and Samavaya...

[ Chapter 4

Even though the eternal nature of substances is established in eternal individuals, their existence in non-eternal individuals is not established. While Vaisheshika considers both eternal, pervasive, and completely pervading in each and every one, which is clearly against reason and perception.

**Complete non-relation of universal and inherence.**  There is no relation of any kind, like conjunction, between the universal and inherence. Therefore, there is no relation of the substance, quality, and action, which is the object, with both of them. (And therefore) the universal, inherence, and object, these three are like empty space-flowers, because the non-existent and the non-object cannot have any form like the tortoise-hair.

**The flaw of non-duality and absoluteness.**

If (according to the Buddhist view) the non-duality of atoms - the absence of otherness in the form of transformation of form in all states - is considered absolute, then even when they come together in the form of aggregates, there will be a lack of connection between them due to the illusion of non-meeting. And if this happens, the fourfold error propounded by the Buddhists - the action of atoms as the four aggregates of earth, water, fire, and air - will be illusory (and not real). (If the four elements are not considered illusory, then the transformation of atoms in the state of aggregation will have to be accepted, and if that is accepted, the absoluteness of non-duality will not be possible.) 

Page #130:
---------------------------
## Karika 68, 69] Devagam

**68**  The error in the effect leads to the error in the cause, and the error in both leads to the error in the effect. The cause is the mark of the effect, and it is not present in the absence of the effect, nor is it a quality, species, or other such thing. 

**Explanation:** If the effect is considered to be an error, then the cause, the atom, will also be considered an error. This would mean that they would not exist in reality, because the cause is known or inferred from the effect. If both the cause and effect are considered to be errors, then the qualities, species, actions, etc., that reside in them would also not exist. This is similar to how there is no smell of celestial flowers because they do not exist.

**69** If the cause and effect are considered to be one and the same (as per the Sankhya philosophy), then the absence of one will lead to the absence of the other. If the cause, the Pradhana, is accepted, then the effect, the Mahat, etc., will not have a separate existence, because they are one and the same. Similarly, if the effect is absent, then the cause will also be absent, because the cause is inseparable from the effect. The cause depends on the effect, and without the effect, it cannot exist. This leads to the absence of everything. Moreover, if it is said that the effect, the Mahat, etc., enters into the cause, the Pradhana, then there will be no need for a subsequent creation, and the existence of the effect will be separate. 

Page #131:
---------------------------
Samantbhadra Bharati
[Chapter 4
Even though there is no difference, there is still one cause - because of its eternal nature, it does not cease to exist, then) there is a contradiction in the number two - if the action and cause are completely one, then this is the action and this is the cause, such a number two cannot be indicated; just as in the case of a thing being completely one, there is no action-cause relationship.
If the duality-number is considered to be a kind of convention or formal, then this convention (being contrary to the ultimate truth) is false, then the duality-number also becomes false - in such a situation, how can the knowledge of the principal be obtained? It cannot be done directly; because the principal is not the object of direct perception. It cannot be done by inference either; because there is no infallible linga. It cannot be done by scripture either; because the word is also considered to be false; and from a false linga, the proof of an infallible sadhya does not occur, and if it is considered to be proved, then the fallacy of atiprasanga arises.
(Similarly, if the unity of the man and the consciousness, which are the support and the supported, is accepted, then the absence of each other is established; if the consciousness enters the man, then there is the occasion of only the man, and if the man enters the consciousness, then there is the occasion of only the consciousness, and from this, in the case of the followers of Samkhya, the absence of one of the two, the man and the consciousness, is proved on the acceptance of complete unity. If one of the two is absent, then the other is also absent; because there is an inseparable relationship between the two. The man is the support and the consciousness-nature is its supported - without the support, there is no existence of the supported, and without the supported, there is no existence of the support. If the two are completely one, then the duality-number also does not arise, and if the convention is imagined in the duality-number, then the occasion of emptiness arises; because

## Karika 70]
**Devaagama**

From the ultimate perspective, there is no possibility of a thing that is devoid of all qualities, including the number two, the number of non-duality, the individual, and consciousness. Therefore, the Sankhya's concept of non-duality, which is based on the principle of cause and effect, cannot be established in the same way as the Vaisheshika's concept of otherness.

The above-mentioned concepts of duality and non-duality, as well as the concept of inexpressibility, are all flawed. They cannot coexist because they contradict each other. This is the view of those who oppose the Syadvada-naya, the proponents of absolute monism. Even if we accept the concept of inexpressibility, it cannot be expressed, for by expressing it, it becomes expressible. If it cannot be expressed, how can the concept of inexpressibility be established? It cannot.

(If the Buddhists argue that from the ultimate perspective, no object or principle can be expressed through words, and that it can only be expressed through conventional means, then how can the truth be established through conventional means, which are inherently false? It cannot. Therefore, even if we try to establish the concept of inexpressibility through conventional language, it cannot be sustained.)

**Samantabhadra-Bharati**

[Chapter 4]

**They are not entirely different.**

**The unity of dravya and paryaya is due to the difference in parinaama (transformation) and shakti (power) and shakti-bhaava (power-state).** ||71||

**The difference in sajnjaa (name), sankhya (number), and vishesha (specific characteristic) is due to the difference in svakshana (own characteristic). The difference in prayojana (purpose) and other things is due to the difference in kaala (time) and pratibhaasa (appearance).** ||72||

'Dravya and paryaya are both (in some way) one; because they are not entirely different (even though there is a difference in their appearance) - due to the impossibility of separating them, there is no complete difference. And dravya and paryaya are (in some way) different - they are different from each other; because there is a difference in parinaama (transformation) and parinaami (transformed), a difference in shaktiman (powerful) and shaktibhaava (power-state), a difference in sajnjaa (name), a difference in sankhya (number), a difference in svakshana (own characteristic), and a difference in prayojana (purpose) and other things (like time and appearance). Therefore, dravya and paryaya are not entirely one, nor are they entirely different - both have a certain degree of difference and non-difference, which is the principle of anekanta (many-sidedness).'

**Explanation:** Here, the word 'dravya' refers to guna (quality), saamaanya (universality), and upaadaanakaarana (material cause), and the word 'paryaya' refers to guna (quality), vyakti vishesh (individual particular), and kaaryadravya (effect-substance). The word 'avyatireka' refers to the impossibility of separation, which means that one dravya cannot be made into another dravya, or one dravya's paryaya cannot be made into another dravya's paryaya, or the intended dravya cannot be completely separated from its paryaya, or the intended paryaya cannot be completely separated from its dravya. In this way, dravya and paryaya are both one thing; like the knowledge of the object and the knower, which cannot be completely separated even though there is a difference in their appearance.

If, according to the belief of the Brahmavaidya (monistic) philosophers, paryaya is considered unreal and dravya is considered real, and paryaya is considered to be... 

Page #134:

##  [Karika 71, 72] Devagama

**65** If we consider substance (dravya) as unreal and mode (paryaya) as real, as per the 65th sutra, then neither substance nor mode can be considered as having any existence. This is because, without modes, substance cannot be the cause of any action or function, and without substance, modes cannot be the cause of any action or function. If we consider either of them as the cause, it will contradict the principle of sequential and simultaneous existence (kram-yogapady). A substance or mode, being of a single nature, cannot have sequential and simultaneous existence. Without sequential and simultaneous existence, there cannot be any action or function, and without action or function, there will be no existence of the object, only non-existence. Therefore, if we eliminate either substance or mode, the other will also be eliminated, and there will be no order or arrangement of the reality.

The characteristic of substance is that it has qualities (guna) and modes (paryaya), as stated in the Tattvartha Sutra, "dravyaṁ guna-paryaya-vat". Qualities are simultaneous (yugapat) and modes are sequential (krama). The characteristic of mode is "tad-bhavaḥ pariṇāmaḥ", which means it is the specific form of the substance, which occurs sequentially and simultaneously. Sequential transformation is called "paryaya" and simultaneous transformation is called "guna". This difference in characteristics of substance and mode proves their distinct nature.

Thus, substance and mode are distinct in some ways due to their different characteristics, they are one in some ways due to the impossibility of separating them, they are both in some ways due to the intention of arranging them sequentially, and they are neither in some ways due to the perspective of their simultaneous existence. The remaining three aspects should also be understood in the same way.

**This concludes the fourth chapter of the Devagama-Apta-Mimamsa.**

The Flaw in the Absolute and Relative Nature of Siddhi
If there were relative siddhi, then duality would stand.
In absolute siddhi, there is no generality and particularity. ||73||

'If siddhi, the certainty of the existence of dharma-dharmi, karya-karana, etc., is considered to be relative, i.e., entirely dependent on each other, then neither the relative nor the absolute can stand. There is no certainty of either, and both are absent. And if siddhi is considered to be entirely absolute, i.e., independent of anything, then there is no generality and particularity. Because both generality, which is anvay or non-difference, and particularity, which is vyatireka or difference, are dependent on each other. Their siddhi is dependent on each other, they cannot exist without mutual dependence. That is, non-difference cannot exist without difference, and difference cannot exist without non-difference.'

Explanation - (The first half of this karika mentions the belief of the Buddhists and its flaw, and the second half mentions the belief of the Yogis and its flaw. The Buddhists believe that in nirvikalpa pratyaksha jnana, there is no appearance of anything like dharma-dharmi, etc., like near and far. The subsequent vikalpa-buddhi, through which the distinctions of visheshana-visheshyatva, samanya-visheshatva, guna-gunitva, kriya-kriyavatva, karya-karanatva, sadhya-sadhanatva, grahya-grahakatva are all imagined, are not real, but are all relative. 

Page #136:

## Karika 73

**Devaagam** states that there is no inherent order in anything. If we accept this relative truth, then both **Neel-lakshana** (blue characteristic) and **Neel-gyaan** (knowledge of blue) are also without order, because both are relative like a qualifier and the qualified.  

Those who are entirely relative in their existence have no order, just like two people drowning in a river, holding onto each other, have no order (both are drowning). Similarly, **Neel** and **Neel-gyaan** are entirely relative in their existence. **Neel** cannot be established without **Neel-gyaan**, because without it, the possibility of **Agyeyatva** (unknowability) arises, and it becomes **Tatha-sanvedan-nishtha** (dependent on perception). And **Neel-gyaan** cannot be established without **Neel**, because **Neel-gyaan** gains its self-benefit from **Neel**, otherwise it becomes **nivishayatva** (object of knowledge), and Buddhists do not consider knowledge as an object. 

Thus, the absence of one leads to the absence of the other, resulting in the absence of both **Neel** and **Neel-gyaan**. When both knowledge and the object of knowledge cease to exist, the possibility of **Sarva-shunyata** (absolute emptiness) arises.

Seeing the flaws in this relative truth, if **Yog-matvadi** (follower of Yoga philosophy) argues that "**Dharma-dharmi** (object and its attribute) are not entirely relative but are **anapeksha** (non-relative), because **Dharma-dharmi** is the subject of **pratinayat-buddhi** (constant intellect), like the nature of **Nola** (a specific type of flower), and without **anapeksha** (non-relativity), **pratinayat-buddhi** cannot be the subject," then this argument is not correct. Because even in **anapeksha** (non-relativity), **anvaya-vyatireka** (affirmation and negation) do not occur. **Anvaya** refers to the general, and **vyatireka** refers to the specific. Both exist only in relation to each other. If we accept their **anapeksha** (non-relativity), then neither the general nor the specific remains stable. 

Even in **pratinayat-buddhi** (constant intellect) subjects, **pratinayat-padarthata** (constant objectness) exists relatively, like **Neel** (blue) and **Peet** (yellow). If we accept **Neel** and **Peet** as **anapeksha** (non-relative), then we cannot determine that this is **Neel** and this is **Peet**.

"Devagama is not formed - mutual expectation is necessary for behavior, not for essence." _ In this way, the relative truth of all substances, which are the essence of dharma, is established from the perspective of behavior, which is non-difference; the absolute truth is established from the perspective of the previously known essence; the relative and absolute truth is established from the perspective of the sequential order of both dharmas, expectation and non-expectation; the inexpressible truth is established from the perspective of the simultaneous statement of both dharmas. The remaining categories of "relative", "inexplicable", etc. should also be arranged in this way, thus establishing the seven-fold predication process here, which is consistent with the specific Nayas as before.

Thus ends the fifth chapter of the Devagama-Mimamsa.

The sixth chapter: If all things are established solely by reason (as per the view of the Buddhist logicians), and the establishment of any truth, such as cause and effect, is not accepted without reason, then there will be no movement, establishment, or knowledge attainable through perception, etc. (and if this is the case, then inferential knowledge based on reason will also not be possible; because for inference, the object of inference,

Direct knowledge of the means and examples is necessary. Without direct knowledge of the virtuous, etc., no inference can be established.  To imagine an inference-antecedent for the sake of inferential knowledge leads to the fault of infinite regress and no inference can be formed. And then, the scriptural instruction in the form of parārthanumāna also becomes useless - it becomes pointless; because even in the case of a familiar object, if the proof is not accepted from direct perception, then knowledge of words and linga (reason) will not be formed; and in this way, both svārthanumāna and parārthanumāna will not be formed.)
If the validity of the entire group of principles is accepted from the scriptures alone, then these contradictory views (which are independent of reasoning) will also attain validity because from the perspective of the scriptures alone, there is no difference between the two scriptures and the presentation of the principles is contradictory to each other. Accepting both as valid or certain from the perspective of the scriptures will lead to the validity of contradictory meanings from the perspective of the principles, and then there will be no real order of any principle, nor will social conduct be well-organized.
The above-mentioned duality and the fault of the inexpressible extremes is the unity of contradiction, which is the hatred of the Syadvada-Nyaya-scholars.
Even in the inexpressible extreme, it is not appropriate to say that it is inexpressible. ||77|| _ If both reason and scripture are considered to be one, then that too will not be possible; because there is mutual contradiction between the two.

If we consider the "unspeakable" (avachya) as a state of isolation, then it would not be possible to say that "truth is unspeakable" because by saying so, it would become speakable, leading to a contradiction.

**He who is not an authority, the truth is established by reason. He who is an authority, the truth is established by scripture.**

**Explanation:** Here, it is important to understand the nature of an authority (apta) and a non-authority (anapta). The nature of an authority has been explained in detail in the earlier verses of this text. In essence, an authority is one who is free from attachment (vitraga), omniscient (sarvagna), and a proponent of the true nature of reality without contradicting the principles of logic. A non-authority is one who deviates from or contradicts the characteristics of an authority.

The act of revealing the truth is called "non-contradiction" (avisamvad), which arises from right knowledge (samyagjnana). One who reveals the true nature of reality is a "non-contradictor" and therefore possesses right knowledge. Right knowledge is characterized by uninterrupted activity (avabadhit-vyavsayarupa) and has two aspects: direct (sakshya) and indirect (asakshya). Doubt, error, and indecision are the three forms of ignorance that are eliminated by right knowledge.

In such a situation, the words of an authority who possesses the aforementioned characteristics...

Thus ends the sixth chapter of Devagamapt-Mimamsa.
Seventh Chapter The Buddhist belief of Antarangaarthata-Ekanta is flawed.
Antarangaarthata-Ekanta is flawed, the intellect and scripture are all false.
It is merely an appearance of proof, how can it be proof without proof? ||71||
'If (according to the Buddhist view of Vijnanavadins) the Ekanta of Antarangaarthata is accepted - the Antaranga, which is self-evident knowledge, is accepted as its reality, and the Bahiranga, which is inert and unfit for perception, is not accepted as its reality, then the intellect, which is in the form of inference, and the scripture, which is in the form of Agama, are all false. When they are false, then they are merely appearances of proof; because proof is characterized by truth, and an appearance of proof is characterized by falsehood (Mrusha). And how can the use of an appearance of proof be possible without accepting the existence of proof? - It cannot be possible. Therefore, the belief in the Ekanta of Antarangaarthata is flawed. It cannot be proven by any proof, such as inference, etc.; and when it cannot be proven, it cannot be made known to others.'
(That which is in the form of the perceiver and the perceived is all illusory, such a belief of the Sanvedanavadins makes even Sanvedana illusory; because knowledge of the true nature also occurs when there is an absence of the characteristics of Vedya-Vedaka.)

Devagam does not occur. Even if everyone is deluded, knowledge of the object and means is not possible. If it is possible in its true form, it does not constitute the establishment of universal delusion.

**Explanation:**

If the object and means are considered to be mere knowledge (vijnana-matrata), then the object, means, and so on, do not arise. If the object and means are mere knowledge (vijnana-matrata), then there is no object, no means, and no illustration (due to the fault of the proposition and the reason).

**Commentary:**

The statement about the side with the object is called the "proposition" and the statement about the means is called the "reason." The "Samvedadvaitavadis" (Buddhists) argue that the blue object and the knowledge of blue are non-dual, because they are experienced together (sahopalambha-niyama). Just as a person with eye disease sees two moons, but the moon is actually one, so too the blue object and the knowledge of blue are not two, but one thing, the form of knowledge.

In this statement, the fault of the proposition that occurs is self-contradiction. This is because it contradicts the distinction between the object and the knower, which is stated by them, and the distinction between the reason and the illustration, both of which are non-dual. This statement cannot be made in the context of complete non-duality.

Therefore, the statement of the non-duality of knowledge, which is the form of the distinction between the object and the means, is a fault of the proposition, which is self-contradiction. 

Page #143:
---------------------------
## 74 Samantabhadra-Bharati
[Chapter 7] The fallacy of the reason is that it proves the absence of difference between blue and the knowledge of blue, due to the absence of separate attainment of blue and the knowledge of blue. This is not proven; because the relationship between the two absences is not proven - the absence of relationship is like the absence of relationship between a donkey and a horn. A reason that does not have an inseparable relationship with the object to be proven is not capable of proving the object and is therefore called an invalid reason.

If it is said that 'just as the absence of smoke is proven by the absence of fire, and the absence of the contained (Sisam) is proven by the absence of the container (tree); in the same way, the absence of difference between blue and the knowledge of blue is proven by the absence of their separate attainment, therefore our reason is not invalid', then this is not correct. Because the absence of the effect is proven only when the relationship of cause and effect between smoke and fire is proven, and the absence of the contained is proven only when the relationship of contained and container between Sisam and the tree is proven, otherwise not - that is, if the existence of cause and effect and contained and container is not already proven, then the absence of the effect in the absence of the cause and the absence of the contained in the absence of the container is not proven. In this way, since the relationship between difference and separate attainment is not proven due to the opposing argument of the proponents of knowledge-only, the absence of separate attainment (in the form of the rule of co-occurrence) cannot prove the absence of difference, therefore their stated reason in the form of the absence of separate attainment is not certain - it is invalid.

The external meaning is always flawed because it is a mere semblance of proof, as it would lead to the success of all actions by those who speak contradictory meanings. ||81||

75. "If only external objects are considered real, and no ultimate reality is attributed to knowledge, then this leads to the elimination of false knowledge, such as doubt arising from apparent evidence. With the elimination of apparent evidence, the arguments of those who advocate contradictory views will be validated. This would mean that those who hold views like *sanvedana-advaita* (non-duality of perception), *brahma-advaita* (non-duality of Brahman), or any other monistic view, or those who contradict direct perception, would not be considered as holding false views or being dishonest. This would be a flaw."

The above-mentioned duality and non-expressible monism are flawed due to their contradiction. Both are one and the same for those who hate the Syadvada logic. Even in the case of non-expressible monism, the statement "it is non-expressible" is not valid, as it contradicts the non-expressible monism. || 82 ||

"The unity (mutual acceptance) of both internal and external objects of knowledge, as monism, is against the Syadvada logic and therefore does not constitute a valid theory. Considering both internal and external objects of knowledge as non-expressible monism, the statement "it is non-expressible" also becomes invalid, as it contradicts the non-expressible monism."

In the above-mentioned two monisms, there is a harmony due to the difference in their respective objects. In the case of internal objects, the evidence is self-awareness, while in the case of external objects, the evidence is sensory perception. Both evidence and apparent evidence arise, where there is a contradiction or obstacle, apparent evidence arises, and where there is no contradiction,

[ Chapter 7: Where there is uninterruptedness, there is proof. In this way, there is no contradiction in the arrangement of proof and non-proof; because due to the absence of a particular covering of the same living being, the attainment of the sensory result in the form of true-false-appearance is established in the same way as the excellent-inferior result of gold is established due to the absence of a particular covering of dirt-blackness. If someone says that the living being is not an object, then this cannot be said; because there is the existence of the proof of the receiver (indicator of existence) of the living being, which is explained in the next verses.

The word 'Jiva' is a noun, therefore it has an external meaning. The word 'Jiva' has an external meaning because it is a noun, like the word 'Hetu'. The nouns of illusion like Maya etc. are like their own pronouncements. || 84 ||

The word 'Jiva' is associated with an external meaning - the meaning of the word 'Jiva' in the external is the living being object, which is specific in form and characteristics - because this word is a noun (name), and the word which is in the form of a noun or name does not exist without an external meaning, like the word 'Hetu' used in the inference of 'Agnimaan' etc., the noun-like 'Hetu' word like 'Dhuma' (smoke) etc. does not exist without the existence of the external object named 'Dhuma' etc., all the 'Hetuvadi' consider the 'Hetu' word to be associated with an external meaning; otherwise, there cannot be any difference between 'Hetu' and 'Hetvabhas'.

(If someone says here that there are nouns of illusion like Maya (illusion) etc., which do not have any external meaning, therefore the noun-making is anekantic - vyabhichari - then it will not be necessary for the word 'Jiva' to have an external meaning, then this is not correct because) the nouns of illusion like Maya etc. are also carrying their meaning along with them, like the pronouncements of proof.

**Specific understanding regarding the fallacy of external objects:** If the meaning of the fallacious terms is considered to be devoid of the fallacious form, then the fallacious term will not be able to produce the fallacious understanding, and the absence of this production will lead to the emergence of the understanding of proof. In other words, it will be necessary to consider the fallacy as correct knowledge, which is not desirable and unobstructed. This will hinder the absence of meaning in words like "kharvishaan" (horn of a donkey) and "khapushp" (sky flower). Their meaning is absent, and if this is not accepted, then the emergence of the meaning of "kharvishaan" etc. will be inevitable. Therefore, there is no contradiction in the said reason for the term with these "kharvishaan" etc.

The elimination of the fallacy of *vyavahara* (practical usage). Just as the word 'jiva' (living being) in the sentence 'one should not kill a living being' evokes the image of a living being, similarly the word 'jiva' in the sentence 'a living being attains enlightenment' evokes the image of enlightenment. And the word 'jiva' in the sentence 'this is called a living being' evokes the image of the word itself. Thus, since three types of understanding arise from the word, each of the three types of cognition (knowledge, perception, and word) has three meanings. This eliminates the possibility of the fallacy of *vyabhicara* (inconsistency) in the *sanjnatva-hetu* (the cause of cognition).

**Verse 86:**

The speaker, the listener, and the knower (who determines the truth or falsity of the speaker's intended meaning based on the heard statement) are all distinct and appear differently. In such a situation, the non-duality of knowledge is not hindered, the fallacy of the 'non-existence of the reason' (asiddha) does not arise, and the 'fallacy of the example' (hetu-shabdavat) does not occur.

**Explanation:**

If it is argued that the speaker, listener, and knower are not distinct from the mind (knowledge) due to the absence of an external meaning, and that the speaker, etc., are merely manifestations of the mind, and that the meaning of the statement also does not exist without the mind, and that the proof itself is in the form of knowledge, then the fallacies of non-existence of the reason, etc., would arise. However, this argument is not valid because:

* If we imagine the speaker and listener as mere perceptions of form, etc., and the proof as a mere product of knowledge, then the perception of form, etc., becomes completely invalid. This invalidity contradicts the acceptance of the non-duality of knowledge.
* The perception of form, etc., the intended meaning, and the speaker and listener as mere perceptions, would not lead to a product of knowledge that is dependent only on its own essence (sva-ansha). This is because knowledge dependent only on its own essence cannot be communicated, and there would be no distinction between the knowledge of the statement and the knowledge of the intended meaning.
* If knowledge dependent only on its own essence is also considered a perception, then the proof would not be established. This is because Buddhists consider infallible knowledge as proof.

**Note:**

The text refers to the Jain concept of "knowledge dependent only on its own essence" (sva-ansha-matra-avalambi). This refers to a type of knowledge that is not dependent on external objects or perceptions. The text also mentions the Buddhist concept of "infallible knowledge" (abhrant-jnana) as proof.

[ Chapter 7
How can the assertion that the object of knowledge (Jnana-dvaita) is the ultimate reality not be contradictory? If we accept the assertion based on other proofs, then everyone will be able to assert their own preferred view, and there will be no way to refute it. If the proof is faulty, then the external object, its similarities and dissimilarities, the objects of knowledge, the internal and external objects, the desirable and undesirable, will all be considered faulty. From the perspective of the knower, both the internal and external objects are external, and they become illusory and faulty due to the faulty proof. In such a situation, how can the distinction between the desirable and undesirable be made if we accept only the internal object (Jnana-dvaita)? It cannot be made. And if we consider the proof to be infallible, then we must accept the external object; because without the external object, there can be no system of proof and apparent proof, as explained in the next verse.
80
The validity of intellect and words, and the system of truth and falsehood, depend on the existence or non-existence of the external object.
The validity of intellect and words depends on the existence of the external object, not on its non-existence. The system of truth and falsehood is thus justified in the case of obtaining and not obtaining the object. ||87||
(For self-understanding) the validity of intellect-based knowledge and (for understanding others) the validity of words depends on the existence of the external object (which is knowledge or ignorance from the perspective of the knower), not on its non-existence. In the absence of the external object, there is only apparent proof. Similarly, the system of truth and falsehood of both intellect and words (which are self-other-side-means-fault-based) is justified depending on the existence or non-existence of the external object. The existence of the external object leads to the truth of both, while its non-existence leads to their falsehood.

This Karika establishes the speaker, listener, and knower, as well as their respective knowledge, speech, and proof, as distinct entities. Therefore, the flaw of non-validity and non-absoluteness of the meaning of the word "Jiva" in the external means of knowledge does not arise. Similarly, the flaw of "Saadhanadharma Vaikalya" (inconsistency in the means of knowledge) as seen in the example of the word "Hetu" (reason) does not occur. This ensures the validity of the Jiva. The Jiva is validated by both the reason and the example. Understanding the meaning of the Jiva leads to the validation of the agreement and disagreement of those who engage in discourse.

Thus ends the seventh chapter of the Devagama Aapta-Mimamsa.

If the validity of the divine (Daiva) is considered absolute, then how can the validity of the divine be attributed to human effort (Paurusha)? If the divine is not liberation, then human effort becomes futile.

[Chapter 8 (If it is said that liberation is achieved by the destruction of fate through human effort, then human effort cannot be called futile, then the same contradiction arises - the promise that liberation is achieved through human effort is not stable, it is contradicted by the promise that everything is produced (achieved) by fate. If the Mimamsakas say that liberation is achieved by fate because the cause of liberation is also created by fate, then there is no contradiction in the promise, then this is not correct; because then human effort is proved to be created by fate, so fate does not remain stable alone. Secondly, the sole acceptance of the achievement of prosperity and liberation through Dharma is contradicted. And thirdly, the context of the futility of the desire of Maheshwara (the desire to create) arises - that is, if creation is dependent on God, then it is not right to say things like 'this ignorant creature is unable to obtain happiness and sorrow, he goes to heaven or hell only by the will of God'.)]

If the sole existence of achievement through human effort is accepted, then the question arises: how is the work of human effort achieved? If it is said to be achieved by fate - by the dependence on the divine wealth of merit and demerit, then how can this be said while accepting the aforementioned sole existence? It cannot be said; because this leads to the contradiction of the promise, and the aforementioned sole principle is contradicted and does not remain stable. If intellect-reasoning...

## Karika 89

If the success of *devaagama* (divine knowledge) and *saayatmika pourusha* (human effort) is attributed solely to *pourusha* (human effort), then *pourusha* would be considered infallible in all beings. In such a scenario, no one's *pourusha* would ever be rendered fruitless (due to the absence of any other hindering cause). However, this contradicts direct observation. We witness that even those who exert equal *pourusha* experience varying outcomes, with one succeeding while the other fails. This inconsistency exposes a flaw in this belief.

If it is argued that *pourusha* is of two types - one guided by right knowledge (*samyaggyaan*) and the other by false knowledge (*mithyaagyaan*) - and that while *mithyaagyaan* based *pourusha* may be flawed or unsuccessful, *samyaggyaan* based *pourusha* always succeeds, then this argument is also flawed. This is because even in *samyaggyaan* based *pourusha*, the Charvaka school of thought observes flaws in the material causes of success. For instance, even with complete knowledge of the factors contributing to a successful harvest, some farmers may still fail to achieve it.

Furthermore, the knowledge of unseen causes (invisible factors) is impossible for those with limited knowledge. Therefore, their *pourusha* cannot be considered effective. If we accept the possibility of acquiring such knowledge through inference or other means of proof, then two possibilities arise: either the unseen cause is a specific aspect of causal power or a specific aspect of merit and demerit (karma).

If we consider it a specific aspect of causal power, then even with complete knowledge of this specific power, *pourusha* can still be flawed. For example, even with complete knowledge of the specific medicinal power required to cure a person with a weak constitution, the effort of administering the medicine may still prove ineffective. This does not establish the infallibility of *pourusha* in all beings.

If we consider the unseen cause to be a specific aspect of merit and demerit, then it implies the assistance of fate (divine intervention).

[Chapter 8: The attainment of the fruit is established only through effort. On the one hand, the arrangement of the object of attainment through the right knowledge of destiny, and on the other hand, the attainment of the fruit even without the knowledge of destiny, is seen. From this, the sole existence of effort with right knowledge is not correct.]

Both and the inexpressible - the sole existence of both is not the same for the knowers of the Syadvada-Nyaya; because there is mutual contradiction in them. Even in the sole existence of the inexpressible, it is appropriate to speak of the expressible. ||9|| 'The knowers of the Syadvada-Nyaya do not consider the destiny and effort to be the same; because there is mutual contradiction in them. Accepting the sole existence of the inexpressible, it is not appropriate to call them inexpressible - because it would contradict one's own words.

The faultless method of the sole existence of destiny and effort - what is desired or undesired, favorable or unfavorable, happens or arises without the expectation of one's own intellect, should be considered as caused by one's own destiny - because in it, effort is secondary and destiny is primary. And what is desired or undesired, favorable or unfavorable, happens or arises with the expectation of one's own intellect, should be considered as caused by one's own effort; because in it, destiny is secondary and effort is primary. ||9||

Devagama does not become otherwise. Therefore, neither of the two is right in isolation, but the **anekanta** view, which is the **syadvada** ethic, is more beneficial - it pacifies all disputes regarding **daiva** and **paurusha**. Therefore, everything is somehow **daiva**-created, from an unintelligent perspective; somehow **paurusha**-created, from an intelligent perspective; somehow created by both, from the perspective of both **daiva** and **paurusha** working together; somehow **daiva**-created and inexpressible, from an unintelligent perspective and from the perspective of **daiva** and **paurusha** working together; somehow **paurusha**-created and inexpressible, from an intelligent perspective and from the perspective of **daiva** and **paurusha** working together; somehow created by both and inexpressible, from the perspective of both **daiva** and **paurusha** working together, and from the perspective of **daiva** and **paurusha** working together. In this way, the **saptabhangi** process is to be understood here as before.

Thus ends the eighth chapter of the **Devagama** interpretation.

The ninth chapter will discuss the flaw of **ekanta** in relation to **duhkha** (suffering) and **sukha** (happiness), **papa** (sin) and **punya** (merit) (The **daiva** that is the means to the desired and undesired is of two types: one is **punya** and the other is **papa**. The Acharya writes, demonstrating and resolving the dispute regarding how these two types of **daiva** arise: - )

## Chapter 9

If it is said that inanimate substances like thorns and milk, and even liberated souls in the state of *Akashaya* (non-attachment) like monks, who are the cause of suffering and happiness for others, are bound by karma, then how can they be considered unbound? (If it is argued that they do not have any intention or resolve to cause suffering or happiness to others, and therefore they are not bound by karma, then it cannot be definitively stated that the production of suffering and happiness in others is the sole cause of karmic bondage.)

**Explanation:** If the production of happiness and suffering in others is the sole cause of karma, then why are inanimate substances like milk and cream, and thorns, which cause happiness and suffering to others, not considered bound by karma? However, no one considers these to be bound by karma. A thorn pricking someone's foot and causing them pain does not make the thorn sinful, nor do karmic particles attach to it or bind it. Similarly, milk and cream bring joy to many, but this joy does not make them virtuous, nor do karmic particles enter them or associate with them in a way that would cause them to experience the consequences in the future. This clearly shows that the aforementioned theory is flawed.

If it is argued that "only sentient beings are capable of being bound by karma, not inanimate objects," then how can the objection regarding liberated souls be addressed? They too cause happiness and suffering to others in various ways. For example, when a monk initiates a seeker into monastic life, it causes sorrow to many of his relatives. When he teaches his disciples and the public, it brings happiness to them. Even while walking with utmost care on the path of liberation,

Even when one is in a state of meditation with complete control over one's body, if a living being flies rapidly and collides with their body and dies, then in this way too, they become the cause of its suffering by being an obstacle in its path. Many righteous, detached ascetics with subdued passions and supernatural powers, merely by the touch of their body or by the air that has touched their body, cure the sick and make them experience great happiness. There are many other ways in which they become the cause of others' happiness and suffering. If the very act of becoming the cause of others' happiness and suffering leads to the inflow and bondage of merit and demerit in the soul, then how can such passionless ascetics escape the bondage of merit and demerit in such a situation? If they too fall into the bondage of merit and demerit, then there can be no arrangement for liberation or moksha; because the root cause of bondage is passion. It is also said, "Passion is the root of all bondage." "Due to the presence of passion, the soul attracts karmic particles, and that is bondage." Therefore, the absence of passion is the cause of liberation. When the absence of passion itself becomes the cause of bondage, then there is no cause left for liberation. In the absence of a cause, the effect also disappears, thus leading to the absence of liberation. And in the absence of liberation, there can be no arrangement for bondage either, because bondage and liberation, being mutually contradictory principles, are inseparably connected - one cannot exist without the other. This has been clearly explained in the commentary on the previous Karika. When there can be no arrangement for bondage, then the story of the bondage of merit and demerit becomes mere talk. Therefore, from the perspective of sentient beings, the aforementioned singular arrangement of merit and demerit is flawed.

[ Chapter 9 ]

If it is said that those who are free from the eight karmas (akshaya-jivas) do not have any intention or desire to cause happiness or suffering to others, and they have no attachment to such matters, therefore they do not acquire karma due to being the instrumental cause in the creation of happiness or suffering in others; then how can the principle that "causing suffering to others is the cause of sin and causing happiness is the cause of merit" be an absolute truth? - Due to the absence of intention, causing suffering will not lead to sin and causing happiness will not lead to merit in other situations as well; rather, due to the opposite intention, causing suffering will lead to merit and causing happiness will lead to sin. For example, a doctor performs surgery on a boil with utmost care, intending to bring about happiness, but while cutting the boil, he also causes some unavoidable suffering to the patient. The doctor will not acquire sin due to causing this suffering; rather, due to his intention to alleviate suffering, this suffering will become a cause of merit. Similarly, a person, under the influence of passions (kṣayābhāva), kicks a hunchback with the intention of causing suffering. As soon as the kick lands, the hunchback's hunchback disappears, and he begins to experience happiness. There is a saying, "A hunchback gets his due by a kick." So, the person who kicked the hunchback will not receive merit for this experience of happiness - he will only acquire sin due to his intention to cause suffering. Therefore, the absolute principle that "causing happiness or suffering to others is the cause of merit or sin" is completely flawed, and therefore cannot be considered as the truth in any way.

88
The absolute principle of merit and sin arising from happiness and suffering in oneself is flawed. Merit is certainly due to suffering, and sin is due to happiness. A wise and dispassionate monk should connect these two with the cause. || 93 || 

Page #158:

## Devagam, Karika 93

"If it is definitively accepted that the binding of karma (punya) arises from the production of suffering within oneself, and the binding of sin (papa) arises from the production of happiness, then even the liberated (kṣayārahita) and wise monks (muni) should be bound by karma and sin; because they too are the cause of the production of their own happiness and suffering."

**Explanation:**

The liberated and wise monks experience suffering in the form of bodily afflictions (kāyakleśa) and happiness in the form of contentment arising from the knowledge of truth, through their practices like trikāla-yoga. If the binding of karma and sin arises solely from the production of happiness and suffering within oneself, then how can these non-passionate beings (akṣayajīva) remain free from the binding of karma and sin? If they are also bound by karma and sin, then there would never be an opportunity for the absence of karma and sin, and no one would be eligible for liberation. Liberation cannot occur without the absence of both karma and sin. And without liberation, the system of binding, etc., cannot remain stable, as explained earlier. If liberation is accepted without the absence of karma and sin, then it would lead to the absence of samsara (the cycle of birth and death) or worldly life, which is not desirable for anyone who believes in the system of karma and sin. In this situation, this singular principle of the binding of karma and sin through self-produced happiness and suffering is also flawed.

Here, if it is argued that the liberated and wise do not experience the binding of karma and sin even though they experience happiness and suffering within themselves, because they do not have any intention, desire, or attachment towards the production of their happiness and suffering, then this would actually prove the principle of anekanta (non-absolutism) and not the singular principle mentioned above. This means that the production of happiness and suffering with intention leads to the binding of karma and sin.

[Chapter 9: The reason for suffering and happiness is not the cause of merit and demerit.
Therefore, both of the aforementioned one-sided doctrines are refuted by evidence, contradict the desired outcome, and therefore cannot be considered correct.
The flawed nature of both the "both" and "unspeakable" one-sided doctrines is due to the opposition of the Syadvada-naya-vidvisha. Even in the "unspeakable" one-sided doctrine, it is not appropriate to say that it is "unspeakable." ||94||
(Seeing the flaws in the separate beliefs of the two one-sided doctrines regarding the bondage related to merit and demerit. If the "both" one-sided doctrine, which is the same as both doctrines, is accepted, it does not become a cause of opposition due to the hatred of those who oppose the Syadvada-naya. Even in accepting the one-sided doctrine of "unspeakable," it is not appropriate to say that it is "unspeakable," because by using the word "unspeakable," it becomes "speakable," and then the one-sided doctrine of "unspeakable" will not remain at all.
If the pure and impure aspects are the cause of happiness and suffering, either for oneself or for others, then happiness and suffering are the cause of the flow of merit and demerit, which leads to bondage. And if neither purity nor impurity is the cause, then (O Arhan Bhagavan!) according to your opinion, it is considered useless - it has no fruit. Otherwise, the bondage of those mentioned in the previous verse (93) - "Aketana Akashaya" and "Vitraga Muni Vidvan" - will also arise.

Akalankadeva clearly states in his 'Ashta Shatika' commentary that "Atam Raudra Dhyana Parinam: Sankleshah" (The result of Raudra Dhyana is Sanklesha). Shrividyananda has adopted this in his 'Ashta Sahasri'. Due to the use of the word 'Sanklesha' in opposition, the word 'Vishuddhi' refers to the 'absence of Sanklesha' ("Tada Bhavah Vishuddhih" - Akalanka). It does not refer to the Kshayika Lakshana (characteristics of destruction) or the Avinashwari Paramashuddhi (indestructible ultimate purity) which is the absence of all Raga (attachment) etc. In that Vishuddhi, there is no place for Puny (merit) or Papa (demerit) and their binding. Therefore, the meaning of Vishuddhi here is the auspicious result free from Atam Raudra Dhyana. This result occurs due to the nature of Dharmya Dhyana (righteous meditation) and Shukla Dhyana (pure meditation). Only when such a result occurs, does the Atma (soul) attain its own nature, its own state, regardless of the degree. Therefore, Akalankadeva, in his commentary, has described this Vishuddhi, which is the absence of Sanklesha, as "Atmanah Swatmanyavasthanam" (the soul's dwelling in its own nature). This leads to the conclusion that the aforementioned Vishuddhi, which is the cause of Puny, is helpful in the development of the Atma, while Sanklesha Parinam (result of Sanklesha) cannot lead to the development of the Atma. Being the cause of Papa, it leads to the downfall of the Atma. Therefore, Puny is called auspicious Karma (action) and Papa is called inauspicious Karma.

Devagam
The cause, effect, and nature of Vishuddhi are called 'Vishuddhi Anga'. Similarly, the cause, effect, and nature of Sanklesha are called 'Sanklesha Anga'. If the happiness and sorrow of oneself and others are due to Vishuddhi Anga, then it is the cause of auspicious binding in the form of Puny. If it is due to Sanklesha Anga, then it is the cause of inauspicious binding in the form of Papa. Otherwise, it is not. In the Tattvarth Sutra, "Mithyadarshana Avirat Pramada Kashaya Yoga Bandha Hetava" (False perception, non-restraint, carelessness, passions, and their combination are the causes of binding), the causes of binding are mentioned as Mithyadarshana, Avirati, Pramada, Kashaya, and Yoga, all of which are results of Sanklesha.

Because they are included in the 'Samkleshang' due to the results of Artha-Roudradhyana, such as the actions of violence, etc., being the work of Samklesha, they are embedded in the Samkleshang. Therefore, there is no contradiction to the above Sutra from this statement of Swami Samantbhadra. Similarly, the statement made by the three Sutras, 'Kayavangmanah Karma Yoga:', 'Sa Asrava:', 'Shubhah Punyasyashubhah Papasya', which establishes the reason for the Shubhakaya, etc., activities as Punyasrava and the Ashubha-kaya, etc., activities as Papasrava, is also not against this; because the Kayadi-Yoga also has the arrangement of Samkleshatva and Vishuddhitva due to the cause-effect-nature of purity and Samklesha. The cause-effect-nature of Samklesha has been explained above. The causes of purity are Samyagdarshana, etc., Dharmyadhyana and Shukladhyana are its nature, and Vishuddhiparinam is its effect. In such a situation, if the Kayadi actions, which are the cause of self-other suffering, have the cause-effect-nature of Samklesha, then due to being Samkleshang, they become the cause of the connection of beings with Ashubhaphaladayak Pudgalas, like the Kayadi actions of poison consumption, etc.; and if they have the cause-effect-nature of Vishuddhi, then due to being Vishuddhyang, they become the cause of the connection of beings with Shubhaphaladayak Pudgalas, like the Kayadi actions of healthy diet, etc. The Shubhaphaladayak Pudgalas are Punyakarma, the Ashubhaphaladayak Pudgalas are Papakarma, and there are many divisions of these Punyakarma and Papakarma. Thus, in brief, this Karika has indicated the cause of Asrava-Bandha of all Shubhaashubharoop Punyappap-Karmas. From this, the knowledgeable reader can understand how mysterious this Karika is for explaining the arrangement of Punyappap.

The summary of all this statement is this - both happiness and suffering, whether they are physical or mental, whether they are for oneself or for others, are the cause of Punyaroop Asrava-Bandha, due to being an Anga of Vishuddhi;

## Kārikā 10] Devāgama

93. In some cases, pāpa (sin) is the cause of āśrava-bandha (influx-bondage) because it is an aspect of saṃkleśa (affliction). In some cases, both puṇya (merit) and pāpa are the cause of āśrava-bandha because they are aspects of kramarpita viśuddhi-saṃkleśa (gradually purified affliction). In some cases, they are avakta (unspeakable) because they are aspects of saharpita viśuddhi-saṃkleśa (simultaneously purified affliction). And when they are not aspects of viśuddhi-saṃkleśa, they are not the cause of bondage. Thus, only through the anekanta-mārga (path of non-absolutism) with its nayas (perspectives) and vivakṣās (interpretations) can the system of puṇya and pāpa be properly understood. It cannot be understood by relying on an ekānta-pakṣa (absolutist view). The ekānta-pakṣa is flawed, as explained above, and therefore cannot be a proper arbiter of puṇya and pāpa.

Thus ends the ninth chapter of the Devāgama's Āptā-Mīmāṃsā.

## Tenth Chapter: Bondage from Ignorance and Liberation from Limited Knowledge

96. "If (as the Sāṃkhya school believes) bondage is necessarily caused by ignorance, then due to the infinity of objects of knowledge, no one could become a Kevali (omniscient) who is free from all errors and possesses true knowledge without the help of any other knowledge. If liberation is caused by limited knowledge, then due to the abundance of ignorance, bondage would always be present and liberation would not be possible because it could not be stopped."

## Chapter 10 of Samantabhadra Bharati: The Flawed Nature of Both Extremes and the Incompatibility of the Two

**Verse 17:**  Those who oppose Syadvada and Nyaya cannot prove the non-contradiction of the two extremes of bondage due to great ignorance and liberation due to little knowledge. Therefore, due to mutual contradiction, they cannot be considered as two extremes. Even if one accepts the extreme of "unspeakable," it is not appropriate to say "unspeakable" because it contradicts the previous statement.

**Verse 98:** The faultless explanation of bondage and liberation due to ignorance and little knowledge is as follows: Bondage occurs due to ignorance accompanied by delusion, which is characterized by the nature of karma and is capable of producing its own results. Ignorance devoid of delusion is not the cause of bondage. Liberation occurs due to little knowledge devoid of delusion; however, little knowledge accompanied by delusion leads to bondage.

**Verse 99:**  The cycle of existence is diverse in form, and the bound soul is purified according to the bondage of karma. The diversity of impurities is of two types: the karma-bondage that is in accordance with the origin of desires, etc., and the bondage of substance and karma. Souls are purified or impure according to their own causes.

Just as knowledge-veil, vision-veil, delusion, etc., are of many kinds due to the peculiarity and diversity of nature, region, state, and section, in the same way, its function in the time of arising is also of various forms due to the peculiarity of ignorance, non-vision, delusion, attachment, aversion, lust, anger, pride, deceit, greed, pleasure, pain, and bodily structure, etc. And from this, it follows that the one who is considered to be the eternal God of the nature of self, and his will or knowledge, cannot be the doer of this diverse-natured world, nor can he be the efficient cause. A detailed discussion of this topic has been given in the Ashta Sahasri with much speculation.

-

And that karma-bondage is according to its causes - the emotions of attachment, etc. Those beings who are bound by karma are of two types, due to the difference of purity and impurity - Bhavya and Abhavya. Beings who possess the capacity to become pure in nature, like right-faith, etc., are called 'Bhavya', and those who do not possess that capacity and always remain in the impure state of wrong-faith, etc., are called 'Abhavya'. Only those who are endowed with the power of purity can attain liberation in due course, not the others.

**Purity - Impurity are two powers, like the capacity of mung, urad, etc., to be digested or undigested - in the form of Bhavya-Abhavya nature - two powers, whose manifestation is respectively Sadi-Anadi. The manifestation of purity is Sadi, and the manifestation of impurity is Anadi; because the expressions of purity, like right-faith, etc., are Sadi, and...**

## [ Chapter 10
The lineage of false views, such as the manifestation of impurities, is endless and continues from the beginningless time. And this is the nature of things, which is not the subject of logic - that is, in its nature, there is no reasoning of the form "why does this happen?".

## The characteristics and divisions of proof
## 
"**(O Arhan Bhagavan!)** In your opinion, what is the proof of true knowledge? That (knowledge of the true form) proof-knowledge is one, the simultaneous manifestation of all (kevalgyan) direct knowledge, and the other is the gradual manifestation (mati etc.) indirect knowledge. The knowledge that is gradually manifested is cultivated by syadvada and nayas - it is manifested by the syadvada form of proof and the nayas like naigama etc."

## Explanation - 
Knowledge that knows the true (yatharth) form is called proof. It is of two types - one is akramabhavi and the other is kramabhavi. The one that manifests all things simultaneously is akramabhavi and it is completely in the form of proof. But the one that manifests things gradually is kramabhavi and it is both in the form of syadvada (proof) and nayas (partial naigama etc.).

## The fruit of proofs
"The fruit of the first, which is the simultaneous manifestation of all, is indifference. The fruit of the remaining, which is the gradual manifestation, is the thought of gain and loss. The destruction of previous ignorance or the attainment of its own sphere for all." 

Page #166:
---------------------------
##  Karika 103] Devagam

**97** The fruit of the group of knowledge, beginning with perception, is the understanding of acceptance and rejection, and the disregard mentioned earlier is also its (interrupted) fruit, and the destruction of ignorance about its own subject is the (uninterrupted or direct) fruit of this entire group of knowledge, which is in the form of proof.

**103** The word 'syāt' (an indeclinable) used in the sentences of both you (Arhan) and the Shruta Kevalis, is considered to be indicative of anekanta due to its connection with meaning, and also indicative of the intended meaning (gamya-bodhya). Otherwise, the understanding of the meaning of anekanta would not be possible.

**Explanation:** The characteristic of rejecting all absolute affirmations, such as 'sat' (being), 'asat' (non-being), 'nitya' (eternal), 'anitya' (non-eternal), etc., is called 'anekanta'. And the name 'vakya' (sentence) is given to the collection of words that are relative to each other within the sentence and independent of the words in other sentences. Any other sentences that are conceived by the opponents, which are different from this characteristic of vakya, are not faultless but are full of contradictions. In Vakyapadi (2, 1-2), while informing about the contradictions and different opinions of the logicians regarding vakya, ten types of vakyas are mentioned, whose names are (1) Akhyatashabda, (2) Sanghata, (3) Jati Sanghatavartini,

**1.** 'Dyotakasch bhavanti nipatah' (Ashta Sahasri) - that is, the indeclinable words are not only indicative but also indicative of (meaning different from the original meaning).

In these types of sentences, from the perspective of the aforementioned characteristics of a sentence (as described by Akalankdeva), which sentences can be considered flawed and which can be considered flawless? Shri Vidyānanda Āchārya has discussed this in detail with reasoning in the Ashta-sahasri.

**The nature of Syadvada**
Syadvada, being a complete rejection of absolutes, is a way of knowing that is born from the word 'kim' (what). It is a marker of the distinctions between the undesirable and the desirable, dependent on the seven-fold negation and the Nayas. || 104 ||

'Syat' - the word, being a complete rejection of absolutes, is a way of knowing that is born from the word 'kim' (what), and thus is a word that indicates 'somehow' or 'in some way'. Therefore, words like 'somehow' are synonyms for Syadvada. This Syadvada is dependent on the seven-fold negation and the Nayas, and is a marker of the distinctions between the undesirable and the desirable (a differentiator). Without Syadvada, there is no proper arrangement of the undesirable and the desirable.'

**Explanation** - The seven-fold negation mentioned here refers to the seven negations of 'asti' (exists), 'nasti' (does not exist), 'avaktavya' (indescribable), etc., which have been discussed earlier in the text. As for the Nayas, there are many variations of them, such as the fundamental Nayas of 'dravya' (substance) and 'paryaya' (attribute), and the fundamental Nayas of 'nishcaya' (certainty) and 'vyavahar' (practical) from the perspective of the soul. From the perspective of purity and impurity, there are also two divisions of Nayas, such as 'shuddha-dravya-arthic' (pure substance), 'ashuddha-dravya-arthic' (impure substance), 'shuddha-paryaya-arthic' (pure attribute), 'ashuddha-paryaya-arthic' (impure attribute), 'shuddha-nishcaya' (pure certainty), 'ashuddha-nishcaya' (impure certainty), 'sad-bhuta-vyavahar' (practical based on reality), 'asad-bhuta-vyavahar' (practical not based on reality), etc. The further divisions of 'dravya-arthic' are three - 'naigama' (general), 'sangraha' (collection), and 'vyavahar' (practical). The further divisions of 'paryaya-arthic' are four - 'rijusutr' (straight thread), 'shabd' (word), 'samabhirud' (common understanding), and 'evambhuta' (such). The first four divisions of these seven Nayas... 

Page #168:
---------------------------
## Karika 105-106]
Devagam
99

'Arthanaya' and the remaining three divisions are called 'Shabdnaya'. There are countless divisions of these, one after another. In short, there are as many divisions of Nayas as there are paths of speech - divisions of words - and alternatives of knowledge. This subject of Nayas is very profound and deep. The specific details of their characteristics, etc., are to be known from texts like Nayachakra, etc.

**Distinction between Syadvada and Kevalgyan - Instruction**

Syadvada - illuminates all principles in Kevalgyan.
The difference is that it is either directly or indirectly, or neither. || 105 ||

Syadvada and Kevalgyan are both illuminators of all principles (like Jiva, etc.). There is a difference (distinction) in their illumination - direct and indirect (indirect). Kevalgyan is the direct and simultaneous illuminator of the seven principles - Jiva, Ajiva, Asrava, Bandha, Samvara, Nirjara, Moksha - while Syadvada, in the form of Shrutagyan, is the indirect (indirect) illuminator of these principles, one by one. Whatever is not illuminated or spoken of by any of these two knowledges is 'Avasthu' (non-existent).

The characteristic of the Nay-Hetu is that it is the same as the object to be proved, by virtue of its similarity to the object to be proved, and by virtue of its non-contradiction.
Syadvada - the Nay which is the special meaning of the divided object - the object to be proved - the object of dispute - the object to be proved - which is expressed by the same Dharma - example - by the similarity of the object to be proved and by the non-contradiction (of the opposite) - is the Gamak or the knower. || 106 ||

'The object to be proved is led or known by this, hence Nay'. From this etymology, the word 'Nay' here is the indicator of the Hetu, and it is also situated in the view of the general Nay, which is the proponent of one Dharma out of many Dharmas.

Samantbhadra-Bharati. [Chapter 10
Information about the nature and distinctions of dravyas, the collection of nayas, upanayas, and ekantas of the three times. The inseparable relationship of dravya is one and many. ||107||
'The collection of nayas, upanayas, and ekantas of the three times, which is the inseparable relationship (identity) of the particular characteristics, is the dravya-substance, and it is one and many in its distinctions.'
The position of absolute and relative nayas is not a group of falsehoods, nor is there any falsehood in the ekantas. Absolute nayas are false, relative nayas are the objects of truth. ||108||
'If it is said that (since you call ekantas false, then the collection of nayas and upanayas, which are ekantas, is dravya, then it is a false collection), the collection of falsehoods is itself false (therefore, dravya is not a substance), then this is not correct, because (O Jinadeva!) in your opinion, and therefore in ours (because of the acceptance of relative nayas), there is no falsehood in the ekantas. The nayas (which are absolutely negating the opposing dharma) are false nayas (durnayas), the relative nayas (which ignore or make the opposing dharma secondary) are not false but true nayas, their objects are the agents of action, and therefore the substantiality of their collection is well-established.'
Explanation-Here, the opponent of anekanta has objected that when ekantas are called false, then the collection of nayas and upanayas, which are ekantas, which is the anekanta and identical reality, is also false; because the collection of falsehoods is itself false. To this, the author says that this 

Page #170:
---------------------------
## 101
**Karika 109**

Devagam (divine revelation) is not correct; because in our system, no object is truly one-sided (mithya ekant). When an object's one dharma (characteristic) does not consider another dharma, it rejects it, and is then called mithya. When it considers the other dharma and does not reject it, it is considered samyak (right). In reality, an object is not truly one-sided, as the absolute one-sided view (ekantvadi) believes. It is relatively one-sided, and the collection of these relative one-sided views is called anekanta (many-sidedness). How then can it, or the object itself, be called mithya? It cannot be.

An object is regulated by rules, such as injunctions (vidhi) and prohibitions (varana).  **"The object is regulated by injunctions, prohibitions, or otherwise. It is necessarily otherwise."** (109)

(If someone doubts how an object, being anekanta, can be regulated by injunctions, leading to a common understanding of the regulated object, the answer is this:) An object, being anekanta, is regulated by injunctions or prohibitions. The object is necessarily both in the form of the injunction or prohibition that regulates it, and in the opposite form, because there is an inseparable connection between injunction and prohibition. Therefore, the injunction or prohibition that regulates the object is primary at that time, and the opposite injunction is secondary. If this is not accepted, if the necessary existence of the object in the form of injunction and prohibition is not accepted, then the object (visheshya) cannot be formed by only an injunction or only a prohibition. Because a prohibition without an injunction, or an injunction without a prohibition, cannot be a characteristic (visheshana), and an object without both injunction and prohibition is like a sky-flower (non-existent). 

Page #171:
---------------------------
## 102 Samantabhadra-Bharati
[Chapter 10 is formed. And in this way, it is observed that in sentences like 'sat' (being) and 'asat' (non-being), there is a secondary and primary role of injunction and prohibition.]

"Speech that calls an object by its own form is not true. Speech that describes an object as 'that' itself, instructs accordingly. A sentence like 'it is a fly' cannot be true. How can it be a declaration of the true meaning? [110]"

_(If it is said that sentences regulate the truth of objects only through injunction, then this is completely incorrect; because)_ "An object is 'that' and 'not that' - it is of the form of anekanta (many-sidedness) with the inseparable connection of the difference of perspective - 'sat' (being) and 'asat' (non-being), 'nitya' (eternal) and 'anitya' (non-eternal) etc. - a sentence (speech) that declares it completely as 'that' - 'sat' (being), 'nitya' (eternal) etc. - is not its opponent, but its contradictor, having made the inseparable dharma (principle) secondary. It is not true. Then, how can such false sentences be a declaration (statement) of the true meaning - the true nature of the object? - It cannot be."

**Explanation:** Although all (injunction and prohibition) sentences declare both injunction and prohibition forms of an object, if it is said that they only instruct according to injunction, then this statement is not true (real) - it is false. And a true statement of the nature of the object cannot be made through false sentences. Therefore, whether sentences are in the form of injunction or prohibition, they all declare both injunction and prohibition forms of the object. The only difference is that through an injunction sentence, the declaration of injunction is primarily made and the declaration of prohibition is secondarily made, and through a prohibition sentence, the declaration of prohibition is primarily made and the declaration of injunction is secondarily made. This is the true declaration of the truth.

**103. The nature of speech is to negate the meaning of other sentences while establishing its own general meaning. Such a sentence is like a flower in the sky.**

(If, as the Buddhists believe, sentences only function through negation, this is not correct. For) the nature of a sentence is to establish its own general meaning while negating the meaning of other sentences without restriction. For example, the sentence "Bring a pot" inherently negates the meaning of other sentences like "Bring a cloth," "Bring a pitcher," "Bring a watch," "Bring a table (chair)," etc.  

The kind of sentence that the Buddhists propose, which is based on negation alone, is like a flower in the sky, a non-existent thing, or equivalent to an unsaid statement. This is because a general without a particular, or a particular without a general, is never found anywhere (inside or outside). When such a thing is not found, how can it be claimed that a general without a particular, or a particular without a general, is the nature of reality? How can one deceive oneself and others with such an argument? One should not be deceived.

**Explanation:** The Buddhists believe that all sentences are based on negation, not affirmation. The Acharya says: The nature of speech (words) is to negate the meaning of other sentences without restriction and to affirm its own general meaning. If only negation were possible, then such a sentence would be like a flower in the sky, a non-existent thing. We never find a general without a particular, or a particular without a general. When such a sentence is not found, how can it be claimed that a general without a particular, or a particular without a general, is the nature of reality?

[If section 10 were not there, then why would we engage in such an attachment, thinking that by means of a sentence, only affirmation (vidhi) or negation (anyapoha) is spoken? Why would we engage in a deceptive tendency or deceive others? Therefore, just as affirmation (vidhi) alone is not established by means of a sentence, in the same way, negation (anyapoha) alone is not established. But both are established, and this is the nature of speech (vani).

**Abhipret-visheshaki prapti ka saccha sadhan samanyavagvisheshe chenn shabdartho mrishha hi sa. Abhipret-visheshapte: syatkara satya-lanchanah. ||112||**

'If it is said that a general sentence (like 'asti') exists in the particular negation (anyapoha) of the other - it indicates that, then this is not correct; because the general sentence is not in the particular form of the word-meaning - it does not know or indicate the particular situated in the intention - and therefore it is not true but a false sentence. The true sign or mark of obtaining the particular situated in the intention is 'syatvada' (statement preceded by the word 'syat') - when a general-particular object is stated mainly in a general form, then its particular form becomes secondary and is situated in the speaker's intention, which is expressed or indicated by the word 'syat' used along with it. And therefore, 'syatkara' is the true means and path of knowing the intended particular. The intended is that which is real by means of its own form etc. (svadravy-kshetra-kal-bhav) - not by means of the other's form etc.'

**Explanation:** The Buddhists say that the sentence that speaks of the general in the form of affirmation also indicates the particular (anyapoha) - its tendency is in that. But their statement is not consistent...

## Karika 113: Devagam

**105 is not correct; because it does not establish the meaning of the term "Anyapoha". The meaning of a word is considered to be that which has its own inherent nature. There is no inherent nature in Anyapoha. In such a situation, the sentence that speaks of the general rule in the form of a law also becomes false according to your opinion. In reality, those sentences are true which lead to the attainment of the specific meaning intended by them, and such a sentence is possible only with the word "Syat" and it is through this that truth (real meaning) is recognized. Because it enables people to attain the specific meaning intended. Other (sentences devoid of Syatkara) do not lead to the attainment of specific meaning. This is the special difference between Syadvada and other philosophies.**

**Syadvada-samsthiti is that which is the predicate, is the part of the desired meaning, is not contradictory to the prohibited, and is the cause of the desired meaning. Similarly, the being-worthy-of-being-taken-up and the being-worthy-of-being-given-up are also Syadvada-samsthiti. ||113||**

**(Asti, etc.) which is the predicate - which is intended by the mind, not due to fear, etc. - and is the cause of the desired meaning, is non-contradictory to the prohibited - non-existence, etc. - that which is not non-contradictory to non-existence, etc. cannot be the cause of the desired meaning; because there is an inseparable relationship between law and prohibition, without law there is no existence of prohibition, and without prohibition there is no existence of law. And just as the predicate, being non-contradictory to the prohibited, is established as the part-cause of the desired meaning, in the same way, the being-worthy-of-being-taken-up and the being-worthy-of-being-given-up of a thing is also established, otherwise not; because if the predicate is absolute, there is a contradiction to the being-worthy-of-being-given-up of something. If the prohibited is absolute, there is a contradiction to the being-worthy-of-being-taken-up of something; according to the opinion of the Syadvadi, the predicate is never absolutely prohibited; in some way, there is a harmony between law and the prohibited.**

##  Translation:

**106**
**Samantbhadra-Bharati**
[Chapter 10 has been considered. Therefore, due to the special nature of affirmation and negation, the Saptabhangi is being applied, leading to Syadvada. Thus, this is the correct position of Syadvada (because it does not contradict any logic or scripture). And therefore, O valiant Bhagavan! The conclusion we have reached, that "you are the infallible and authoritative source due to your statements that do not contradict logic or scripture," is impeccable - free from all objections.]

The purpose of Aapta-Mimamsa is as follows: This Aapta-Mimamsa is prescribed for those who desire the good.
For the understanding of the specific meaning of correct and incorrect teachings. ||114||

"Thus (in the scripture called 'Devagama', which has ten chapters), this Aapta-Mimamsa - the examination of the omniscient - is intended for those who desire the good - primarily for the Bhavyajivas who aspire for liberation and the three jewels (right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct) that are its cause - for the understanding of the specific meaning of correct and incorrect teachings. And thus, it is for the attainment of faith, knowledge, and conduct." Thus ends the tenth chapter of the Devagama Aapta-Mimamsa.

**Concluding Benediction for the Translator**
Whose righteous teachings in this world are marked by the infallible sign of Syadvada - not absolute monism but relative pluralism, hence never failing - full of compassion for all beings, possessing self-control, renunciation, and meditation. ||1||
Whose teachings are enriched by logic and evidence, free from all objections, and incomparable to all others. To that valiant one, we offer our salutations. ||2||

##  **Kārikā 114] Devāgama**

**107** I bow down to those glorious Vīra Bhagavāns who are filled with compassion, subdue the senses, renounce possessions, are eager for meditation and absorption, are replete with their teachings, well-established by Nayas and Pramanas, free from all obstacles, beneficial to all, and invincible by all other solitary rulers - no one can conquer them.

**3** May the glorious Samantabhadra, the hero of this age, be auspicious for us, whose praises are sung by great Munis like Akalankadeva, Vidyānanda, Bhagavatzinaseṇa, and Vādirāja, the foremost, with their divine words, who are immersed in devotion to him. May we, through his grace or by worshipping him with joy, attain more and more of our own glory - the light of our inner Lakshmi, the brilliance of our beauty, the wealth of our prosperity, the power of our Saraswati, and the abundance of our Siddhi.

Thus ends the Devāgama, also known as Āptā Mīmāṃsā Śāstra, composed by the incomparable, the master of the twelve branches of knowledge, the jewel in the crown of all logicians, the one adorned with the multitude of virtues like faith, knowledge, and excellence, the Siddhasārasvata Swami Samantabhadra Ācārya, which is a special understanding of the meaning of the right and wrong teachings. It is completed with the clear meaning and translation by the hero of the age, the youthful prince, the liberated sun, Muktāravi.

1. The word "Śrī" is used in all the meanings expressed in the explanation of "nijasro" and which are intended here.
