---------------------------
We are extremely delighted to present this illuminating treatise on Karma to the readers, as this Karmagranth Mata, whose commentator is the revered Shri P. Tho Sukhlalji Sanghvi, has been unavailable for a long time. To fill this gap, our organization decided to publish all six parts of the Karmagranth. Subsequently, with the cooperation of many helpful brothers, this important task was also completed so that the thirst for knowledge of the Karma principles could be quenched.

We heartily congratulate the officials and members of the Shri Varshman Jain Poleevelinik, Badaut, for the publication of this present Karmagranth, which becomes mandatory to read after reading the third Karmagranth, and after reading this, it becomes easy to understand the Panchasangrah and Kammapayari etc. texts. They have published this book at their own expense on the auspicious occasion of the 88th birth anniversary of the most revered Acharya Samrat Pujya Gurudev Shree Shree 1008 Shri Anand Rishiji Maharaj and presented their devotion to the Acharya Dev.

The inspiration of Shri Vakil Chandji Jan, the treasurer, is the main reason for the publication of this fourth Karmagranth. He has also shown his religious spirit by working tirelessly in getting this book printed and published.

Due to the publication after a long time and the non-availability of error-free literature, it is possible that there may be errors in printing. We apologize for this. Suggestions for improvement and corrections are always welcome for future editions.

With thanks,
Sincerely,
Falaash Chand An
President, Shri Varshman Jain Dhaarmik Shiksha Samiti

## Karmagranth Part Four

**Verse 76:**  
"Salute to the Knower. Thus read this book, filled with essence. Write this, for you, the fourth, which is the essence of the universe."

**Verse 77:**  
"The number of leaves of the palm tree, the number of grains of sand in the ocean, even the number of atoms in the universe, all are less than the number of karmas."

**Verse 78:**  
"The number of karmas is vast, even the number of atoms in the universe is small compared to it. The number of karmas is vast, like the infinite changes of time."

**Verse 79:**  
"Multiply the number of atoms in the universe by itself four times, then add the number of moments in time, and even then, you will not reach the number of karmas. The number of karmas is vast, like the ocean, deep and vast."

**Verse 80:**  
"Even if you count the number of atoms in the universe, the number of moments in time, and the number of karmas, all together, it will still be less than the number of karmas. The number of karmas is vast, like the infinite universe."

**Verse 81:**  
"The number of karmas is vast, like the infinite space, like the infinite time, like the infinite number of worlds. The number of karmas is vast, like the infinite number of beings."

**Verse 82:**  
"The number of karmas is vast, like the infinite number of particles in the universe, like the infinite number of moments in time, like the infinite number of beings. The number of karmas is vast, like the infinite number of worlds."

**Verse 83:**  
"Even if you multiply the number of karmas by itself, you will not reach the number of karmas. The number of karmas is vast, like the infinite universe."

"The number of karmas is vast, like the infinite number of beings, like the infinite number of worlds, like the infinite number of moments in time. The number of karmas is vast, like the infinite universe."

"The number of karmas is vast, like the infinite number of beings, like the infinite number of worlds, like the infinite number of moments in time. The number of karmas is vast, like the infinite universe."

"The number of karmas is vast, like the infinite number of beings, like the infinite number of worlds, like the infinite number of moments in time. The number of karmas is vast, like the infinite universe."

## Introduction |
## Name |

This chapter is popularly known as the "Fourth Karmapranya," but its real name is "Shadsheetik." It is called "Chauya Farmgranth" because it is the fourth in the six Karmagranths. And the name "Shadsheetik" is assigned because it contains sixty-six original verses. This chapter is also called "Sukma Bichar" because the author has mentioned the phrase "Suhamstah Viyaroh" at the end of the text. Thus, it is clear that all three names of this chapter are meaningful.

Although the version published by Shri Bhimso Majik in "Prakaran Ratnakar Chaturth Bhag" from Nirnayasagar Press, Bombay, contains ninety-nine original verses, it is not the original version. Because the three verses that appear in the second, third, and fourth positions in the original version are not actually original, but are the subject-collection verses of this chapter. That is, these verses demonstrate what the main topics are in this chapter and how many other topics are related to each main topic. Therefore, the author has quoted these three verses in his own commentary, but has not taken them as original and has not commented on them.

**Sangati**

Firstly, the subject matter of the **Karma Granthas** is clear in the **Sangati**. That is, firstly, the **Karma Grantha** describes the number of **Mula** and **Uttara Karma Prakritis** and their **Vipaka**. Secondly, the **Karma Grantha** takes each **Gunasthan** and describes the number of **Bandha**, **Upay**, **Udirana**, and **Sattagata Uttara Prakritis** that are possible in it. And thirdly, the **Karma Grantha** takes each **Marganasthan** and describes the **Bandha** ownership of the **Uttara Karma Prakritis** in relation to the possible **Gunasthanas**. The third **Karma Grantha** describes the **Bandha** ownership in relation to the **Gunasthanas** in the **Marganasthanas**, correct. However, the **Mula** does not independently state anywhere which **Gunasthanas** are possible in which **Marganasthanas** and how many.

Therefore, the fourth **Karma Grantha** expounds on this subject and fulfills the aforementioned inquiry. Just as there is an inquiry about the **Gunasthanas** in the **Marganasthanas**, there is also an inquiry about the **Gunasthanas** in the **Jivasthanas** and the **Jivasthanas** in the **Gunasthanas**. Not only that, there is also an inquiry about **Yoga**, **Upayoga**, and other subjects in the **Bahya Jivasthanas**, and about **Jodhasthan**, **Yoga**, **Upayoga**, and other subjects in the **Marganasthanas**, and about **Yoga**, **Upayoga**, and other subjects in the **Gunasthanas**. The fourth **Karma Grantha** was composed to fulfill all these inquiries. Therefore, it primarily holds three **Adhikaras**: **Jivasthan**, **Marganasthan**, and **Gunasthan**. And each **Adhikara** respectively describes eight, six, and five subjects, which are indicated in the meaning of the first **Gatha** on page 2 and also in the **Sphuta Note** through the **Sangraha Gathas**. Apart from this, there is also a discussion...

In this text, the author has considered both emotions and numbers. 

It is not a question that, even though it is necessary to expound on the qualities of the *maganga sthana* in accordance with the *sangati* for the third *karma prameya*, why were not many other new topics discussed in this text, just as other topics have been discussed in detail? Because it is impossible to discuss all topics in one text. Therefore, it is up to the author to decide how many and which topics to discuss and in what order. In other words, the author is independent in this matter. No one has the right to interfere in this matter.

The ancient and modern *chaturtha karma grantha*, "Shad-shitika", is the common name for both, because the number of verses in both is the same, sixty. However, the modern author has named it "Sookshmanam Vichar", and the ancient author has named it "Agami Vastu Vichar Saar" in the end of the commentary. Just like the modern one, the ancient one also has three main topics: *josa sthana*, *maganga sthana*, and *guna sthana*. The secondary topics are eight, six, and five respectively in the modern one, and the same in the ancient one. Even though the number of verses is the same, the modern one has the special feature that the author has described two more topics in detail by using a concise style of description. The first topic is "emotions" and the second is "numbers". The nature of both is detailed in the modern one and not at all in the ancient one. Apart from this, the topics and *prama* are the same in both the ancient and modern ones. Commentary and notes on the ancient one...

Description, salvation, and auspicious voices are there. Yes, they are like the Gujarati ones on the Nadin, but they are not ancient.
For specific information about this relationship, i.e., which interpretations are ancient and which are new, in which language and by whom they were created, one should refer to the table of Karma-related literature at the beginning of the Karmagranth.
The fourth Karmagranth and the Agamas, Panchasangrah and Gommatasar.
Although some parts of the fourth Karmagranth (such as Gunasthan, etc.) are found described in Vedic and Yogic literature with different names and forms, no specific text of the same category has been found in the literature of both these traditions. Jain literature is divided into the Svetambara and Digambara sects. In the literature of the Svetambara sect, the ancient texts 'Agama' and 'Panchasangrah' are the works of specific scholars, which contain the entire subject matter of the fourth Karmagranth, or rather, the fourth Karmagranth was created based on them.
Although the topics in the fourth Karmagranth are described in a particular order, they are not all described in the same order in any one Agama or Panchasangrah; however, almost all of its topics can be found in different parts of different Agamas and Panchasangrahs. This translation provides information about which topic of the fourth Karmagranth is found in which Agama and which part of the Panchasangrah. 

Page #20:
---------------------------
This commentary has been provided as much as possible in the context of that subject, so that the practitioners of the present text may know some suitable places of the Agamas and Panchasangraha, and may have the opportunity to understand the differences and special features.

It is beneficial for the practitioners of the present text to be introduced to the Agamas and Panchasangraha; because the reason for the glory of those texts is not only their antiquity, but also their subject-depth and clarity of subject.

'Gommatasar' is a well-established text on karma of the Digambara sect, which is available at present. Although it is much later than the Svetambara Agamas and Panchasangraha, yet the subject-description, subject-division and characteristics of each subject are very clear in it. The 'Jivakanda' and 'Karmakanda' of Gommatasar are very similar to the brain. The subject of karma is investigated in it, and it is much larger than that. Although all the subjects of the fourth karma text are mostly described in the Jivakanda, yet the style of description of both is very different in many respects.

The main principles in the Jivakanda are: 1 Gunasthan, 1 Jodh Sthan, 1 Paryapti, 1 Pran, 1 Sanjna, 14 Marganas and 1 Upayog, a total of twenty. Each principle has a detailed and detailed description in it. In many places, it also differs from the fourth karma text. _It is not surprising that the Jivakanda is a special thing to see for the readers of the fourth karma text. Because many special things can be known from it. Many special things related to karma, which are the goal in Svetambara texts, are also available in Digambara texts. Therefore, both sects

---------------------------
Those who are particularly inquisitive should definitely see other texts on the same subject. From this very amitraaya, in order to show the samya and vaishamya of that subject in the translation, many suitable passages from the Gommatasar have been introduced and inserted at various places.

**Subject Introduction:**

Inquisitive people do not develop an inclination to study a text until they become familiar with the subject matter of that text. In accordance with this rule, in order to create an inclination in qualified authorities for the study of the present text, it is necessary to introduce the subject of the present text at the beginning. This is called "Subject Introduction."

The introduction of the subject can be done in two ways: general and specific.

(a) The purpose for which the text was created, its main subject, and how many divisions it is divided into. Describing the other subjects related to each division, how many and which ones they are, and explaining the relationship between the subject-soul and the word-body of the text, i.e., indicating what the main and secondary subjects of the text are and what they are described in, is a general introduction to the subject.

(b) Explaining the nature of each subject through its characteristics is its specific introduction.

The specific introduction of the subject of the present text has been done as much as possible in the original text itself in the place where that subject is described. 

Page #22:
---------------------------

It has gone. Therefore, it is necessary and appropriate to introduce the subject in general at this place.
The purpose of writing this book is to describe the different states of worldly beings and to establish that certain states are temporary and undesirable due to being conditional, potential, or karma-created; and certain states are permanent and desirable due to being natural. It also aims to show that the soul's nature is primarily to evolve. Therefore, it explains how the soul evolves according to its nature and how it manifests its natural powers by abandoning conditional states.
To achieve this objective, this book mainly discusses five topics:
(1) Jiva-sthān (State of the Soul), (2) Mārgaṇā-sthān (State of the Path), (3) Guṇa-sthān (State of Qualities), (4) Bhāva (Emotion), and (5) Saṅkhyā (Number).
Among these, the first three main topics are discussed along with other subjects: In Jiva-sthān, (1) Guṇa-sthān, (2) Yoga (Union), (3) Upayoga (Application), (4) Leśyā (Tendencies), (5) Bandha (Bondage), (6) Udaya (Arising), (7) Uvīraṇā (Covering), and (8) Sattā (Existence) are discussed. In Mārgaṇā-sthān, (1) Jiva-sthān, (2) Guṇa-sthān, (3) Yoga, (4) Upayoga, (5) Leśyā, and (6) Alp-bahutva (Fewness-Manyness) are discussed. In Guṇa-sthān, (1) Jiva-sthān, (2) Yoga, (3) Upayoga, (4) Leśyā, (5) Bandha-hetu (Cause of Bondage), (6) Bandha, (7) Udaya, (8) Uvīraṇā, (9) Sattā, and (10) Alp-bahutva are discussed. The last two topics, namely Bhāva and Saṅkhyā, are not discussed in conjunction with any other topic, meaning no other topic is discussed in relation to them. 

Page #23:
---------------------------
Thus, the main parts of the presented Prajya's autumnal body become the main characters.
The first part is from the second to the eighth verse, which describes the main features of the Jivasthana and describes the eight related topics. The second part is from the ninth to the forty-fourth verse, which mainly describes the Magganasthana and its related topics. The third part is from the forty-fifth to the sixty-seventh verse, which mainly describes the Gunasthana and its related topics. The fourth part is from the sixty-eighth to the seventy-seventh verse, which only describes the emotions. The fifth part is from the seventy-eighth to the eighty-seventh verse, which only describes the numbers. The book ends with the description of the numbers.
The nature of the Jivasthana, etc., the main and secondary topics mentioned above, has been written in the Acharya of the first verse. Therefore, there is no need to write it again here. Although it is necessary to write that the purpose of creating this book, which is written above, can be achieved by describing the Jivasthana, etc., the above topics.
Jivasthana, Magganasthana, Gunasthana and Bhava are the various states of worldly beings. The description of Jivasthana can be used to find out whether the form of life is in four states, depending on the species, or on the development of the physical structure or the number of senses. This is why all are perishable or potential and are therefore ultimately despicable. The knowledge of Magganasthana makes it clear that all Magganas are the natural state-form of the being. 

Page #24:
---------------------------
There are no other paths except for *kevalgyan*, *kevaldarshan*, *kshaayik samyaktv*, *kshaayik charitra* and *anraaharaktva*. All other paths are unnatural, to a greater or lesser extent. Therefore, for beings who desire the fullness of their nature, they are ultimately to be discarded. From the knowledge of *gunasthan*, it becomes known that *gunasthan* are the roles that indicate the further development of the soul, which is engaged in spiritual evolution. When the roles of the previous stages become unnecessary due to the attainment of the roles of the later stages, all those roles are automatically abandoned. From the knowledge of emotions, it becomes certain that except for *kshaayik* emotions, other dense emotions, even if they are necessary during the time of evolution, are ultimately to be discarded. In this way, the *jivasthan* etc., which are presented in this text, are very useful for those who practice spiritual thought, in order to distinguish what is natural and what is unnatural for the being.

**Soul**

Spiritual texts are of two types. One type describes only the pure nature of the soul, while the other describes the impure and mixed nature. This text belongs to the second category. Such texts are particularly useful for primary and secondary practitioners of spiritual knowledge, because their perspective is practical, and through such texts, they can gradually be made to incline towards the ultimate nature of reality.

Every practitioner of spiritual knowledge has a natural curiosity about how and in what order the soul evolves spiritually, and what kind of states it experiences during its evolution. From the perspective of fulfilling this curiosity, *gunasthan* is more important than other subjects. 

Page #25:
---------------------------
This article will discuss the nature of Gunasthan in detail. It will also explain how spiritual development is described in Jain, Buddhist, and Bhavik scriptures. While this may be lengthy, the insights shared will hopefully benefit curious readers and enhance their knowledge and understanding.

**The Specific Nature of Gunasthan**

Gunasthan refers to the stages of development, or the places of qualities (atma shaktis). In Jain scriptures, the term Gunasthan refers to the gradual manifestation of atma shaktis in their pure, functional form, from the initial state of Tara Samabhava Padma to the final state of liberation. The true nature of the soul is pure consciousness and complete non-duality. However, as long as dense clouds of karmic coverings obscure it, its true nature remains hidden. As these coverings gradually weaken or dissolve, the soul's true nature is revealed. When the intensity of the coverings is at its peak, the soul remains in its primary, undeveloped state. When the coverings are completely destroyed, the soul attains its ultimate state - the fullness of its pure form. As the intensity of the coverings diminishes, the soul gradually progresses from its primary state towards its ultimate state, leaving behind its initial state and gradually gaining the benefits of its pure form. During this journey, the soul passes through numerous stages, some higher and some lower... 

Page #26:
---------------------------
##  Translation:

---
One has to experience the stages. The first stage should be understood as the culmination of involution or degeneration, and the final stage should be understood as the culmination of evolution or liberation. All the intermediate stages of this evolution-involution can be called both higher and lower in comparison. That is, any intermediate stage can be called lower than the stage above it and higher than the stage below it. The soul progressing towards evolution actually traverses such countless spiritual stages. But Jain scriptures have classified them in brief into fourteen divisions, which are called "Chaudah Gunasthanas".

Of all the coverings, the covering of attachment (moha) is the primary. That is, as long as attachment is strong and intense, other coverings remain strong and intense. Conversely, as attachment weakens, other coverings also weaken in the same way. Therefore, in the development of the soul, the strength of attachment should be understood as the main obstacle and the weakening of attachment should be understood as the main help. For this reason, the concept of the stages of evolution in Gunasthanas is based on the intensity, weakness, and absence of the power of attachment.

There are two main powers of attachment. The first power does not allow the soul to have darshan, i.e., to decide its own nature, form, or the division or discrimination between inert and conscious. And the second power does not allow the soul to gain liberation even after acquiring it, and accordingly, it does not allow it to be free from practice or its consequences. It is said that when one truly understands the nature of an object, one tries to obtain or abandon it, and one succeeds. For the soul progressing towards spiritual development, the main thing is the same... 

Page #27:
---------------------------
There are two actions. The first is to perceive the difference between the true self (**swarupa**) and the non-self (**pararupa**) through **darshan** (insight) or **bhedgyan** (knowledge of differentiation). The second is to reside in the true self. The power of attachment (**moha**) that hinders the first action is called **darshan-moha** in Jain scriptures, and the power of attachment that hinders the second action is called **charitra-moha**. The second power is a follower of the first. This means that the second power does not weaken until the first power is strong; and as the first power becomes **manva**, **bhandatar**, and **manyatam**, the second power also gradually becomes the same. Or, you could say that once the soul achieves **swarupa-darshan**, it then gains the path to achieving **swarupa-labh** (attainment of the true self).

The state of an undeveloped or completely degenerate soul is the first **gunasthan** (stage of spiritual development). In this stage, due to the strength of both the aforementioned powers of attachment, the soul is completely fallen in its spiritual state. During this stage, no matter how much the soul achieves worldly success, its inclination is completely devoid of the true goal. Like a traveler who mistakes west for east, the soul does not find its desired destination; all its efforts are in vain. The soul in the first stage considers the non-self as the true self and remains eagerly longing to attain it, becoming a victim of the eight strong blows of aversion or hatred (**viparit varjan ya mina ke 8 dvesh**) and remaining deprived of true happiness. This stage is called **bahiratmanath** or **miyyavarshan** in Jain scriptures. All the souls present in this stage do not have the same spiritual state. Although both powers of attachment generally dominate all of them, there is still some variation in the intensity of attachment. Due to some reason... 

Page #28:
---------------------------
13 -

The influence of attachment (moh) varies, being stronger in some and weaker in others. It is the nature of the soul to evolve. Therefore, knowingly or unknowingly, when the influence of attachment begins to lessen, the soul starts to progress towards liberation. It develops the strength to resist the most intense passions (rag) and break the first power of attachment. This state is called "pranidhi bhed" in Jain scriptures.

The task of a seeker (panthi) is indeed difficult. Once the intense knot of passions (rag-vesh) is loosened and broken, consider the journey almost complete. After this, the primary power of attachment weakens quickly, and the weakening of perception-attachment (darshan moh) automatically opens the path for the weakening of knowledge-attachment (jnana moh). On one hand, passions exert their full force, and on the other hand, the evolving soul also uses its energy to reduce their influence. In this spiritual battle, mental afflictions and the soul constantly struggle for victory. 

* "Manthitti sudubheo bavakhad ghan roodh gooth garin. Jeevasma karma janilo ghan rag dhos parinamo." (1195)
* "Bhinnammi tammila bho sammattai mokkh hekanam. Soy dulllamo parissamchitt vidhayaai vihin." (1196)
* "So tattha parissammai ghor mahasamar nigayaichch. Vijjay siddhikale jahba vigya taha soni." (1197)

Special Commentary: 

Page #29:
---------------------------
There are also those who, despite manifesting the strength to almost break through the knots (granthi-bhed), are ultimately struck by the intense blows of attachment and aversion, defeated by them, and return to their original state. Even after many attempts, they are unable to conquer attachment and aversion.

There are also those who neither fall back in defeat nor achieve victory, but remain caught in the spell of that spiritual battle for a long time. Some souls, however, use their power appropriately and conquer attachment and aversion in that spiritual battle.

In any mental affliction, we often experience these three states in competition: sometimes falling back in defeat, sometimes staying in the competition, and sometimes achieving victory. This struggle is called "sangharsh" (struggle). Struggle is the cause of development. Whether it be knowledge, wealth, or power, any worldly object that is desired, many obstacles arise in obtaining it, and in overcoming them, everyone experiences these three states of competition.

When a student, a seeker of wealth, or a seeker of power strives for their desired goal, they either give up their efforts upon seeing the many difficulties in the way, or they overcome the difficulties and move forward on the path to achieving their goal. Those who move forward become great scholars, great wealthy, or great renowned. Those who flee in fear of difficulties remain ordinary, ignorant, poor, or unrenowned. And those who can neither conquer the difficulties nor flee back in defeat, remain in an ordinary state, achieving no noteworthy excellence or benefit.

To explain this feeling, a parable is given in the scriptures* that three travelers were going somewhere. Seeing terrible thieves in the middle, one of the three ran away. The second was afraid of those thieves and did not move, but was caught by them. The third, however, defeated those thieves with extraordinary strength and skill and moved forward. The parable can give a little idea of the victory and defeat that occurs in fighting spiritual battles with mental disorders.
*
Three men, together with their families, were traveling. When they saw thieves, one of them immediately ran away. 
The second one was afraid and did not move, so he was caught. 
The third one, however, was strong and skillful, so he defeated the thieves and continued on his journey. 
This parable shows that in the battle against mental disorders, there are both victories and defeats.

## Chapter 16

There are many souls residing in the first Gunasthan (stage of spiritual development) who have slightly suppressed the intense velocity of attachment and aversion, but they have not weakened the dominant power of delusion, specifically, the delusion of perception. Therefore, although they are not entirely aligned with the spiritual goal, their understanding and character are still better than other undeveloped souls. Although the spiritual vision of such souls is not entirely self-oriented and is actually considered Mithya (false) or Avyakt (unmanifest), it is considered useful because it brings them closer to the right path.

In comparison to the most intense states of understanding, energy, and character, this false vision is categorized into four types, marking the final stage of the Mithya Drishti Gunasthan.

**Illustrative Explanation:**

> The life of a being is like a traveler.
> The state of karma is the knot, the place of bondage is the fearsome forest.
> Attachment and aversion are the thieves, fear is the guard.
> Reaching the knot, they experience misfortune, which binds them to the highest state.
> The one who is obstructed by attachment, aversion, and other hindrances is like a traveler trapped in the forest.
> The one who does not break the knot and does not escape the forest is lost.
> The one who reaches the desired city of liberation through previous efforts is like a traveler who has escaped the forest.
> By abandoning attachment and aversion, he has attained right vision.

**From Lokaprakash Sangraha 3:**

> The one who has attained the state of dullness in the middle is like a friend who has also seen the path.
> He guides others towards liberation through his own understanding.

A good picture is drawn in the scriptures. There is no delay in gaining the benefits of creation in these four visions that are present.
The scriptures have also divided the *Sad-drishti* into four divisions, based on the expectation of *Sanghoṣa*, *Sad-dvaya* and *Sad-charitra*, in which all the newly developed souls are included after abandoning *Mithya-drishti* or conquering the power of delusion, one or both. In another way, it can be understood as follows: in which the nature of the soul is manifested and there is a main tendency for its attainment, it is *Sad-drishti*. On the contrary, in which the nature of the soul is neither manifested as it is nor there is a tendency for its attainment, it is *Asad-drishti*. Keeping in mind the *tar-tam-bhav* of *Bodh*, *Viry* and *Charitra*, the scriptures have divided both the visions into four divisions each, in which all the developing souls are included and whose description, when read, makes the spiritual development dance in front of the eyes.

Due to the sensation of physical and mental suffering, the covering of *Ārama* becomes slightly loosened in the unknown form, and due to this, the amount of its *Anumob* and *Pauryollas* remains somewhat. Then, the purity and tenderness of the results of that developing soul increases somewhat. Due to which, it acquires the ability to break the knot of *Rāga-Dvesha* in some parts. This unprecedented suffering-sensation-generated very slight self-purification is called 'Yathāpravṛttikaraṇa' in the Jain scriptures. When the amount of self-purification and *Pauryollas* increases even more, then the breaking of that knot of *Rāga-Dvesha* is experienced. This self-purification, which is the cause of the breaking of the knot, is called 'Anapūrvakaraṇa'.

This is called 'Athāpravṛttikaraṇa' in the Digambara sect. For this, see the 13th *Rājvātik* of the 1st sūtra of the 6th chapter of *Tattvārtha*.

"Tībhādhārapārśakalpā, khyikāraṇena hi || Āviṣkṛtya paraṁ vīrya, granthiṁ bhindanti ke cana || 618 ||"

---------------------------
Because such a cause-effect *development of the soul* is obtained for the first time. After this, the amount of *asmi-shuddhi* and *voryolsas* increases somewhat, then the soul surely conquers the main power of delusion - *varshanmoha*. This victorious self-purification is called "**aniyutti karan**" in Jain scriptures. As that self-purification takes place, the soul does not remain without conquering *varshanmoha*, i.e., it does not retreat. This type of purification is the second in the *aram-shuddhis*, i.e., the purification called **apuurvakaran** is very important. Because the speed of the passions of attachment and aversion -

The most difficult task to stop is done by that which is not natural. Once success is achieved in this task, even if the developing soul falls from a higher role, it will still regain its goal - the spiritual complete form - sooner or later. This spiritual situation can be explained somewhat by experiential practical analogy.

For example, there is a cloth that has both dirt and grease on it. Removing the dirt from the surface is not as difficult, if not more laborious, as removing the grease. Once the grease is removed, then removing the remaining dirt does not require much effort due to any reason, and the cloth can be easily brought back to its original form. The force that is used to remove the dirt from the surface is "Yathapravrittikaran". The special force and effort that removes the grease is "Apuvarkaran", which loosens the intense attachment of raga-dvesha, which is like the grease. The remaining dirt, after the grease is removed, is like the force used to reduce the dirt that has been applied again, which is "Anivrittikaran". Of the three types of force used, the force used to remove the grease is unique.

Or, for example, a king has divided his bodyguards into three divisions for self-defense, in which the second division is stronger than the other two divisions, then special force has to be applied to defeat it. First, his guards are like the three

For the evolving soul, there are three stages of exertion. The second exertion, which is the one that sends the knot of attachment and aversion to its most intense state, is the most important. Just as in the three groups mentioned, the punishment is easier to bear when the second group of bodyguards is present, similarly, conquering the delusion of perception is easier when the intense attachment and aversion are eradicated. Having conquered the delusion of perception and attained the end of the first stage of perfection, the evolving soul sees its true nature. The delusion of its true nature, which it had been experiencing, is removed. Therefore, the direction of its effort becomes straight instead of reversed. It becomes discerning and can differentiate between right and wrong actions. This state is called "Antaratma Bhava" in Jain scriptures. Because, having attained this state, the evolving soul begins to see the subtle and natural pure Paramatma-Bhava within itself. Antaratma Bhava is the gateway to the temple of the soul, entering which, one sees the certainty of the Paramatma-Bhava present within that temple.

This state is the fourth stage or the fourth stage of perfection in the evolutionary process. Attaining this stage, the soul experiences spiritual peace for the first time. In this stage, the spiritual vision is true (soul-oriented) and free from distortions. This is called Samyagdrishti or Samyaktva in Jain scriptures.

"Jinoctādviparysthā, samyagdṛṣṭinigaḍyate | Samyaktvaśālināṁ sā spā,-tamantra jāyasanginām ||596||"
Hokaprakash, Sarg 3. 

Page #37:
---------------------------
One should understand that all the stages from the fourth, i.e., the fifth and onwards, are all characterized by **Dristi** (vision); because in them, there is progressive development and increasing purification of **Dristi**. In the fourth **Gunasthan** (stage of spiritual development), by realizing the true nature of the self, the soul experiences unprecedented peace and gains the conviction that its delusion regarding the object of its pursuit has been dispelled, i.e., the external and worldly happiness that it was yearning for is ephemeral, unstable, and limited. True, lasting, and infinite happiness lies in attaining the true nature of the self. Then, the soul begins to strive for the state of being established in its true nature.

This development, even after weakening the primary power of **Moha** (attachment) - **Darshanmoha** (attachment to perception) - by realizing the true nature of the self, cannot lead to the attainment or establishment of the true nature until its other power - **Charitramoha** (attachment to conduct) - is weakened. Therefore, it strives to subdue this **Moha**. When it partially weakens this power, it experiences greater peace than in the fourth **Gunasthan**, as it abandons the external and worldly pursuits. This is the fifth **Gunasthan** called **Veshvirati** (abandonment of external appearances).

In this **Gunasthan**, the developing soul begins to think that if such great peace is attained by partial renunciation, then how much greater peace will be attained by complete renunciation - the complete abandonment of all worldly attachments. Inspired by this thought and strengthened by the experience of the attained spiritual peace, the developing soul strives to weaken **Charitramoha** to a greater extent, achieving even greater stability and attainment of the true nature than before. Upon achieving success in this endeavor, it attains complete renunciation...

**Samyama** is attained when there is no trace of the **Paulika** emotions, and all of the time is spent in expressing the **Swaroop**. The **Javiriti** is a state of **Daman** (restraint). In this state, there is a feeling of **Lok-Kalyan** (welfare of the world) and **Savanukula** (favorable) tendencies, in addition to **Aram-Kalyan** (self-welfare). This leads to occasional **Pramaad** (lapses) in small amounts.

Compared to the fifth **Gunasthan**, in this sixth **Gunasthan**, the **Swaroop** expression is greater. Therefore, the developing soul experiences more **Adhyatmik Shansti** (spiritual peace) than before. However, it cannot tolerate the many **Pramaad** that hinder its peace experience. Therefore, driven by a strong desire to experience the unique peace of **A-Pramaad** (non-lapses) along with the **Sarva-Viriti** (complete restraint) peace, the developing soul welcomes **A-Pramaad**. It abandons all activities except **Manan-Chintan** (meditation and contemplation) in accordance with the expression of the **Swaroop**. This is the seventh **Gunasthan** called **A-Pramattasanyata**.

In this state, the soul experiences an intense joy arising from **A-Pramaad**, which motivates it to stay in this state. On the other hand, the **Pramaad**-induced **Purvakasana** (previous tendencies) pull it back. In this tug-of-war, the developing soul oscillates between **Pramaad** (lapses) and **A-Pramaad** (non-lapses), going back and forth between the sixth and seventh **Gunasthan** many times. Just like a straw caught in a whirlpool or a storm is tossed around, the developing soul becomes unstable during the sixth and seventh **Gunasthan**.

During this internal war with **Pramaad**, the developing...

If a progressing soul illuminates the special light of the fourfold force of non-attachment, then it crosses over the temptations and allurements and attains the special state of non-distraction. Having attained this state, it prepares itself with such power that the remaining clinging attachments can be destroyed. This role of preparation for the future battle with attachment is called the eighth Gunasthan.

In this Gunasthan, such self-purification occurs for the first time. As a result, some progressing souls gradually suppress the influence of the karmas of attachment and eventually make them dormant. And there are others with special self-purification who completely eradicate all those karmas from the very beginning. Thus, those who progress beyond the eighth Gunasthan, i.e., those who approach the supreme role of the Atman-nature through the development of the inner self-nature, are divided into two categories.

One category consists of those who completely subdue attachment once but are unable to destroy it. Just as a measure of liquid filled in a vessel sometimes, due to its momentum, throws the vessel up or down, or just as fire suppressed under ashes starts working as soon as it gets a gust of wind, or just as mud settled at the bottom of water, upon slight disturbance, rises up and makes the water muddy, similarly, the previously subdued attachment, due to its momentum, throws down those first-category souls who are exhausted in the internal battle. Even after being completely subdued once, attachment, which...

The eleventh guṇasthāna is the one that defeats the soul from the bhūmikā and throws it downwards.  The moh must be gradually purified, from bāvatē-cavātē to sadhā bāvanē, and it must necessarily acquire higher and higher bhūmikās.  This is the guṇasthāna that causes the maudhā and dasarvā guṇasthāna.  The twelfth guṇasthāna is the place of downfall, because the one who attains it, even though they may progress further, will inevitably fall down at some point.

The second category of souls, as they gradually become lower and lower, finally become completely lost in it.  The bhūmikā that completely eradicates it is the twelfth guṇasthāna.  To attain this guṇasthāna, that is, before completely eradicating the moh, one must attain the maudhā and vasā guṇasthāna in between.  Similarly, if we look at it, whether they are of the first category or the second category, they all attain the ninth-vasavā guṇasthāna.  The only difference between the two categories is that the second category has a different kind of ātmā-śuddhi and ātmā-pal than the first category.  For example, there are two types of students in a particular subject: one type is unable to pass their exam even after trying a hundred times, while the other type, due to their ability, overcomes all difficulties and passes the most difficult exam.  The reason for this difference between the two groups is the difference in their internal ability.  Similarly, the ātmā of the two categories who attain the maudhā and vasā guṇasthāna have different levels of mādhāśmik śuddhi.  As a result, one category, after attaining the vasavā guṇasthāna, ultimately loses to the moh in the eleventh guṇasthāna and falls down, while the other category, after attaining the vasavā guṇasthāna,

Having attained the eleventh **guna-sthana**, they manifest such great self-strength that in the end they completely destroy attachment and attain the twelfth **guna-sthana**.
Just as the eleventh **guna-sthana** is necessarily recurrent, so the twelfth **guna-sthana** is non-recurrent. That is, the soul that attains the eleventh **guna-sthana** necessarily falls from it once, while the soul that attains the twelfth **guna-sthana** never falls from it but only ascends. Just as students who fail in one exam, by diligence and concentration, increase their competence and then pass that exam; in the same way, souls who have once lost to attachment, by being vigilant and increasing their self-control, necessarily destroy attachment again.
The souls of these two categories are like two paths leading to the highest position of the **paramatma-vi-rupa**, spiritual purity, which are called '**upshama shreni**' and '**kshapka shreni**' in Jain scriptures. The first one takes one up a little distance and then makes one fall, while the second one only takes one up. Even if the one who falls from the first **shreni** goes down to the first **guna-sthana** due to spiritual decline, his state of decline does not remain permanent. Sooner or later, he prepares himself with double the strength and double the caution to face the enemy of attachment, and finally, attaining the competence of the second **shreni**, he completely destroys attachment.
In practice, that is, in the **adhi-bhautic** realm, it is also seen that one who is defeated once can defeat the enemy who defeated him again by being fully prepared.
The main obstacle in attaining the sovereignty of the **paramatma** is attachment. Its destruction depends on the specific development of the inner self. Once attachment is completely destroyed, the other coverings, which are like rust...

Those who are called 'Ghatikam' in the scriptures, like the remaining soldiers after the death of the commander-in-chief, scatter in all directions. Then, without delay, the evolving soul immediately attains the complete spiritual sovereignty of the Supreme Soul, that is, it fully expresses the nature of Sachchidananda and gains the benefit of perfect peace, character, etc., and experiences indescribable inherent bliss. Just as the full moon shines brightly on a full moon night, so too at that time the soul's consciousness and other primary powers are fully developed. This stage is called the thirteenth Gunasthan in the scriptures.

In this Gunasthan, the soul, remaining in Chirfal, takes refuge in the subtle-action-oriented, pure-knowledge-form wind to throw away the remaining coverings, like the dust on a mirror, that is, the non-primary, non-fatal karmas. It completely stops mental, verbal, and physical activities. This is the culmination of spiritual development, the fourteenth Gunasthan. In this, the soul, through the subtle-action-oriented, pure-knowledge, attains a stable state like Mount Meru and finally, after shedding the body, attains a transcendental state in terms of conduct and ultimate purpose. This is the state of Nirguna Brahma. This is all-round completeness, this is complete fulfillment, this is the final achievement of the ultimate goal. "Yogasenyaamataratyagi, yoganannyadillaasyajet. Ityevam nirgunam brahma, paroktam upapadyate. || 7 || Vastutastu gunah purna-manatarbhasane svatah. Rupam tyaktatmanah madho,-nirabhrasya vidhorisha. || - ||

And this is the state of non-repetition. Because the only cause of the world is delusion. Due to the complete annihilation of all karmas, there is no possibility of an upadhi anymore.

This story is about the twelve gunasthanas from the first to the fourteenth, including the second and third gunasthanas. The story that was left out is this: When someone with samyaktva or tattvajnan, who is on the path of the fourth and higher realms, deviates from the royal path and leans towards the path of the first realm, which is devoid of true knowledge or is based on false beliefs, there is a state in between for that soul who is falling down. This is the second gunasthan. Although there is a little more self-purification in this gunasthan compared to the first gunasthan, its number is kept before the first because of this. However, it should be kept in mind that this gunasthan cannot be called a state of transcendence. Because a soul who has transcended the first gunasthan cannot directly attain this second gunasthan. But a soul who falls from a higher gunasthan becomes eligible for it.

Apapasana (non-virtuous conduct) arises from delusion. Therefore, at the time of this gunasthan, one finds the intense power of delusion's kashya (passion). Just as after eating sweet food like khor, etc., when one vomits, a peculiar taste is perceived in the mouth, neither too sweet nor too sour, similarly, a peculiar state of the soul is found at the time of the second gunasthan. Because at that time, the soul is neither on the path of true knowledge nor on the path of complete ignorance. Or, just as a person who is climbing stairs slips and does not immediately reach the ground, there is a peculiar state in between.

The soul experiences a unique spiritual state in between the fall from the state of *samyaktva* (right faith) to the state of *mithyatva* (false faith). This is also evident from our practical experience that when a certain advanced state falls to a certain degraded state, a unique situation arises in between.
The third *gunasthan* (stage of spiritual progress) is the name given to the soul's mixed state, where it has neither *samyak drishti* (right faith) nor *mithya drishti* (false faith), but oscillates between the two. Therefore, its intellect is not independent, and it is *sambehashol* (confused), meaning it accepts everything that comes before it. In other words, it neither knows *tattva* (truth) as a separate entity nor can it fully understand the true nature of *tattva*.
A soul that is progressing can move from the first *gunasthan* directly to the third *gunasthan*, and a soul that is regressing can also fall from the fourth *gunasthan* to the third *gunasthan*. Thus, the third *gunasthan* is the resting place for both progressing and regressing souls. This is the special characteristic of the third *gunasthan* compared to the second *gunasthan*.
The above-mentioned states of the soul, along with their sub-categories, are classified in the scriptures as three states for embodied souls: (1) *bahiratma* (external soul), (2) *antaratma* (internal soul), and (3) *paramatma* (supreme soul).
In the first state, the true and pure form of the soul is extremely... 

Page #45:
---------------------------
The soul, due to its false beliefs, becomes engrossed in worldly pleasures and considers them as the ultimate goal, devoting all its energy to attaining them.

In the second stage, the true nature of the soul is not fully revealed, but the veil over it becomes loose and thin, causing its inclination to shift from worldly pleasures towards its pure form. This leads to a sense of renewal in the body, despite its aging, as it is no longer bound by the old desires. This second stage is the stepping stone to the third stage.

In the third stage, the true nature of the soul is revealed, meaning the dense veils over it completely dissolve.

The first, second, and third stages describe the *Bāhyātmā* (external soul) state. The fourth to twelfth stages describe the *Antarātmā* (internal soul) state, and the thirteenth stage describes the *Paramātmā* (supreme soul) state.

"Others, due to the influence of false beliefs, are *Bāhyātmā*, while those influenced by right beliefs are *Antarātmā*, and those influenced by perfect knowledge are *Paramātmā*. The first stage is *Bāhyātmā*, followed by the *Kṣīṇamo* (diminished) stages until the *Antarātmā*, and then the *Paramātmā*. Similarly, *Bāhyātmā* in terms of manifestation, and *Paramātmā* in terms of power. *Antarātmā* in terms of manifestation, and *Paramātmā* in terms of power, *Bāhyātmā* based on past experiences, *Paramātmā* in terms of manifestation, and *Antarātmā* based on past experiences."

- *Adhyātma Matapariksha*, Verse 125. 

Page #46:

The nature of the soul is knowledge, therefore, no matter in which state of being it may be, it is never free from attention. From the general point of view of the soul, there are two divisions: (1) auspicious and (2) inauspicious. From the special point of view of the soul, there are four divisions: (1) *ārt*, (2) *raudr*, (3) *dharma*, and (4) *śukla*, as described in the scriptures. The first two are inauspicious and the last two are auspicious. The attention that occurs during the predominance of the *paurāṇika aṣṭi* or the time of forgetting the self is inauspicious, and the attention that occurs during the subordination of the *paurāṇika aṣṭi* and under the influence of self-inquiry is auspicious.  Inauspicious attention is the cause of worldly existence, and auspicious attention is the cause of liberation. In the first three states of being, *ārt* and *raudr* are the types of attention that are found due to the influence of the *tar-tam-māva*. In the fourth and fifth states of being, in addition to these two types of attention, *dharma-dhyāna* also occurs due to the influence of *samyaktva*. In the sixth state of being, *ārt* and *dharma* are the types of attention. In the seventh state of being, only *dharma-dhyāna* occurs. From the eighth to the twelfth states of being, *dharma* and *śukla* are the types of attention. In the thirteenth and fourteenth states of being, only *śukla-dhyāna* occurs.

"The soul, the inner soul, and the supreme soul, these three are the objects of contemplation, as is well known in the scriptures of yoga." (Tattvārtha, Chapter 8, Sutra 17)

"Others, who are in the state of *mithyātva* (false belief), *samyaktva* (right belief), and *kevalajñāna* (perfect knowledge), are those who are free from delusion, whether they are in the mixed state or the state of diminished delusion." (Tattvārtha, Chapter 8, Sutra 18)

*Yogāvatāra* (Chapter 2, Verse 1)

"The types of attention are *ārt*, *raudr*, *dharma*, and *śukla*." (Tattvārtha, Chapter 8, Sutra 26)

+ For this, see Tattvārtha, Chapter 6, Sutras 35-40; *Dhyānaśataka*, Verses 63 and 64; and *Āvश्यक-हारिभद्री* commentary, page 602. In this regard, it is worth noting the difference in opinion between the *Tattvārtha* and the *Śvetambara* texts.

From the above description of the Pyams found in the Gunasthanas and from the Mahiraasm-Bhav in the Gunasthanas, as described in the previous section, every human being can generally know that he is the possessor of a particular Gunasthana. Knowing this, the possessor of the Gyeya, Sri Nagik, is stimulated by an intense desire for the higher Gunasthanas.

**Similarity of Jainism with other philosophies**

All philosophies that are Astika, i.e., believe in the soul, its rebirth, its development, and its capability for liberation, naturally contain the idea of the gradual development of the soul in some form or another. Therefore, this idea is found in the three ancient philosophies of Aryavarta, namely Jainism, Vaidik, and Buddhism. This idea is known as Gunasthana in Jainism, as Bhumikas in Vaidik philosophy, and as Abasthas in Buddhism. Although the idea of Gunasthana is more subtle and detailed in Jainism than in other philosophies, there is a great deal of similarity between the three philosophies in relation to this idea. Although there are differences in the symbolism, description, etc., there is virtually no difference between the three philosophies in terms of the actual truth. The Vaidik philosophy, in its works like Yoga Vasistha and Patanjali Yoga, has a good idea of the Bhumikas of the soul.

Jainism describes the characteristics of the ignorant Gyeya as Mithyadristi or Bahiratma, which means that one who considers the non-soul, i.e., the inert element different from the soul, as the soul, is Mithyadristi or Bahiratma. Yoga

(2) In the first part of the Yoga Vasistha creation chapter, it is described as a little less than the experience of suffering from desire due to ignorance and the destruction of ignorance from knowledge. The same order is described in the Jain scriptures in various places by the description of wrong knowledge and right knowledge. (3) In the said chapter of Yoga Vasistha, the name of ignorance from knowledge and knowledge from thought, which is mentioned, is similar to the destruction of wrong knowledge from knowledge of knowledge, etc., and the destruction of knowledge of knowledge from knowledge of knowledge in Jain scriptures. (4) In Jain scriptures, mainly delusion is considered to be the cause of bondage and the world. In Yoga Vasistha, the same

This is said in the Bal Rupantar. The reason given for the existence of the body being bound is the pride or ego of the heart. (5) Just as the Granthi-mev is described in Jain scriptures, so it is in the Yoga Vashishtha. (6) The description of the soul acquiring the body through contact with Maya and creating a world of thoughts and perceptions through contact with the mind, and the destruction of the world of stationary and mobile beings at the end of the Kalpa, can be reconciled with the Jain doctrine in this way: the soul's transition from the state of non-action to the state of action is the soul's acquisition of the body.

"The object of perception, the six categories of existence, is called bondage. The perceiver is bound by the object of perception, and is liberated in the absence of the object of perception." (22)
- Genesis Chapter, Section 1.

"The mind, which is full of wrong thoughts, is like a demon child. It always deceives the perceiver by making it appear as the object of perception." (38)
- Genesis Chapter, Section 3.

"The separation from the objects of perception is liberation. The thirst of the mirage, the water in the mirage, and other such things are all just peace." (23)
- Genesis Chapter, Section 115.

"It constantly creates itself, and thus it is called a magical illusion." (16)

"All that is seen in this world, both stationary and mobile, is like a dream in sleep, and is destroyed at the end of the Kalpa." (10)

The first karma, subtle and minute, obtained through the mind, is the wandering of the soul in the realm of imagination, which is the creation of the cycle of birth and death. The liberation from the essence of karma is the end of the worldly cycle, which is the name of the world of stationary and mobile beings. The soul forgets its own nature and considers the material nature as its own, which is the cause of the rise of the feeling of "mine" and "I", which is the form of delusion. This feeling of "mine" and "I" is the cause of fear, according to the Vedic style of description. Birth, growth, development, heaven, hell, etc., which are the states of the soul, are described in the Vedic scriptures. These are the cycles of the soul according to the Jain scriptures. (7) In Yoga Vasishtha, the state of being in one's true nature is considered the characteristic of the wise, and the state of being in one's true nature is considered the characteristic of the ignorant. In Jain scriptures, also, right faith is considered the characteristic of the wise, and wrong faith is considered the characteristic of the ignorant. (8) In Yoga Vasishtha, the characteristic of right faith is...

Yes, it is in accordance with Jain scriptures. (9) Jain scriptures describe the attainment of perfect knowledge through two ways: (1) inherent nature and (2) external causes. * The Yoga Vasistha also mentions the same way of attaining knowledge. (10) The description of the stages of liberation in Yoga Vasistha is very interesting and detailed, in accordance with the Jain scriptures. Seven stages of liberation
"This is the definite conclusion, wise men know that ignorance is the cause of liberation." || 2 ||
-Upasama Prakarana, S. 761 * "From the body or from the knowledge."

It is said to be attained through birth after birth, or through Siddhi. || 3 || The second is sudden, for one with a slightly awakened mind,
Knowledge is attained, like the fruit of a tree. || 4 ||

The seven states of existence are described as follows, which are known in common parlance as:

These seven states of existence, listen to the awakened consciousness. The highest of the nine states, I declare this to be mine. || 15 ||

Thus, the perception of the self, due to the absence of the perception of the body and its attributes. This is I, this is mine, thus arises the perception of rebirth. || 16 ||

The perception of the self is said to be strong, shining with great awakened consciousness. Not attained or attained, in all ways it is the self. || 17 ||

The state of mind in the awakened state, the awakened dream is said to be. It is of two kinds, like the moon and the conch shell, and like the mirage, etc. || 18 ||

Having attained the awakened state through practice, the dream becomes manifold. Seen for a short time, it is not true, even so. || 19 ||

The perception that arises after sleep, at the end of sleep. That is called a dream, it is located in the great awakened state. || 20 ||

The body does not bloom due to the absence of long-term vision. || 21 ||

The dream is the sprout of the awakened state, it has gone to the state of the great awakened state. || 21 ||

Whether the body is intact or injured, that is the perception of the dream-awakened state. The state of the soul after abandoning the six states. || 22 ||

The future, which is like a mirage, is called the state of deep sleep. In this state, grass, clods, stones, etc. || 23 ||

Objects are located, as small as atoms. These seven states are said to be, I have declared them in my knowledge. || 24 ||

The fourth stage is *sthaapatti*, followed by *samsakti*. The sixth stage is *padarthaabhavi*, and the seventh is *turyaga*. (6) Liberation is attained in the last stage, and there is no further sorrow. (7) I am confused about these stages. I am a fool, I should consult a learned scholar. (8) The desire to learn with humility and respect is called *shubhechcha*. (8) The practice of *pairagya* with the guidance of a learned scholar is called *vicharana*. (9) *Vicharana* is the desire for good, and attachment to sense objects is called *tanumanasa*. (10) The practice of the first three stages leads to the state of being established in the true self, free from attachment to objects. This is called *sattvapatti*. (11) The practice of the first ten stages, along with the ten *sangha* fruits, leads to the state of *samsakti*. (12) The practice of the first five stages leads to the state of *aamyantgana*, where there is no attachment to external objects. (13) The constant contemplation of the absence of objects, through the efforts of others, is called *padarthaabhavna*. This is the sixth stage. (14) The practice of the first six stages, through the realization of the true nature of the self, leads to the state of *turyaga*. (15)

Thoughts on Yoga. What is the difference between the concept of Gunasthan and Yoga? From the description of the roles of the Gunasthan's various Amanas and Gyanas, it becomes clear how the soul's spiritual development takes place. And from the description of Yoga, it becomes clear what the means of liberation are. In other words, the main focus of Gunasthan is the order of spiritual development, while the main focus of Yoga is the means of liberation. Thus, even though the main purpose of both is different, the shadow of one is always present in the other. Because no soul can directly attain the ultimate or immediate means of liberation, but rather attains the successive, appropriate means in a step-by-step manner, ultimately reaching the ultimate means. Therefore, the concept of Yoga, which is about the steps of liberation, inevitably includes the shadow of the order of spiritual development. Similarly, when considering the order of spiritual development, the shadow of the soul's pure, purer, and purest states, which are the means of liberation, is also present. Therefore, it is not inappropriate to briefly discuss the nature of Yoga in the context of the description of Gunasthan.
What is Yoga? - The soul's Dharma-Vyapar, which is the main cause of liberation, i.e., the instrumental cause, and which leads to results without delay, is called Yoga. Such Vyapar, which includes Pranidhan and other auspicious * "Mokshan Yojana Dav, Yoga Patra Niruchhyate. Lakshnam Ten Tan Mukhya, Hetu Chyaapar Taray Tu. ||1||
- Yoga Lakshna Vishifa.

Bhaṣā is an action that is performed with auspicious intentions. In the Patañjalayāna, the restraint of the citta's vṛtti is called yoga. It has the same meaning, that is, such restraint is the main cause of mokṣa, because it is necessarily connected with auspicious bhavas in the form of cause and effect.

When does yoga begin? - The ātmā has been caught in the flow of birth and death since time immemorial and has been engaged in various activities. Therefore, the question arises that his activities have been considered as yoga. The answer to this is given in the scriptures that as long as the ātmā is filled with mithyātva, is like a warrior, is deluded and moving in the wrong direction, that is, is corrupted from the āramma and the goal, then his activities are praṇidhāna, aviśubha-bhāva: "Praṇidhānaṁ pravṛttiśca, tatha vignajayaśniyā. Siddhiśna viniyogaśca, ete karmaśumāyāmaḥ. || 10 ||" "Etairashayogaiśtu, vinā dharmāya na kriyā. Pratyuta pratyapāyāya, lobhamocriyā yathā || 16 ||"

It cannot be called "yoga" because it is devoid of it. On the contrary, when the darkness of *mithyatva* diminishes due to *timira* and the soul starts to lose its delusion, and its movement becomes straight, i.e., towards *sammā*, only then can its activity be called "yoga" because it is accompanied by auspicious emotions like *praṇidhāna* etc. In essence, the soul's *anādi* worldly time is divided into two parts. One is called *charmapudgalparāvarta* and the other is called *acharmapudgalparāvarta*. *Charmapudgalparāvarta* is the last and very small part of the *anādi* worldly time. *Acharmapudgalparāvarta* is its much larger part. Because remembering *charmapudgalparāvarta*, the *anādi* worldly time, which is the magnitude of an infinite time cycle, is called *acharmapudgalparāvarta*. When the soul's worldly time is left with the magnitude of *charmapudgalparāvarta*, the veil of *mithyatvamoh* starts to disappear from it. Therefore, its results become pure and its actions also happen with pure emotions. Such actions further increase emotional purity. Thus, due to the increasing emotional purity, the *dharma* activity during the *charmapudgalparāvarta* time is called "yoga". The activity during the *acharmapudgalparāvarta* time is neither done with auspicious emotions nor is it the cause of auspicious emotions. Therefore, it is not called "yoga" because it is traditionally not the cause of *mokṣa*. In *pāśa* darshan also, the *nivṛtta* and *anivṛtta* nature of the *anādi* worldly time is like this:
* : "The last of the living beings, the *siddha*, is accepted by them.
From the earth, they have crossed over, one drop in the ocean." - 28 -

Two types of distinctions have been explained, which are synonymous with the ultimate and non-ultimate * pudgala-paravarta of Jain scriptures. The types of yoga and their basis. _In Jain scriptures, there are five types of yoga: (1) Adhyatma, (2) Bhavana, (3) Dhyana, (4) Samata, and (5) Vritti-kṣaya. In the Patanjali Darshan, there are two types of yoga: (1) Samprajñāta and (2) Asamprajñāta. The one that is the direct cause of liberation, i.e., the one after attaining which liberation happens immediately, is truly called yoga. Such yoga, according to Jain scriptures, is Vritti-kṣaya and according to Patanjali Darshan, it is Asamprajñāta. Therefore, the question arises: what is the basis of the many types of yoga that are described? The answer is that although Vritti-kṣaya or Asamprajñāta is the direct cause of liberation and is truly yoga, it is not attained by a developing soul right from the beginning. Instead, before that, it has to perform many internal religious activities according to the development process, which enhance the development progressively and ultimately lead to that true yoga. All those religious activities are caused by yoga, i.e., Vritti-kṣaya or Asamprajñāta * "Yojanādyoga ityukto, mokṣeṇa nimittaḥ saḥ | Sa nivṛtta-adhikāri, prakṛto laśato dhruvaḥ || 14 ||"
- Apunarbaddha-tridikā. + "Adhyātma bhāvanā dhyānaṁ, samatā vritti-kṣayaḥ || Yogaḥ pañca-vidhaḥ prokto, mogamārga-viśāgdaiḥ || 1 ||"
—Yogabhedadvātriśikā. See, Pāda 1, Sutra 10 and 18.

Actions are called Yoga because they are directly or indirectly caused by Yoga. In essence, the basis of the fruits of Yoga is the process of development. If development were not gradual but achieved completely in one go, the fruits of Yoga would not be considered. Therefore, Vṛtti-saṁkṣaya, which is the direct cause of liberation, should be considered the primary Yoga. Those actions that are counted in the category of Yoga are called Yoga because they are caused by the primary Yoga. The totality of all these actions is called Samprajñāta in the Pātañjala-darśana and in Jain scriptures, it is divided into four categories, namely Ādhyātma, etc., according to the intensity of purification. When actions that are directly or indirectly caused by Vṛtti-saṁkṣaya are called Yoga, the question arises as to when these actions should be taken. But the answer has already been given that the actions performed from the Dharmapura-lapravṛtta-kāla onwards should be counted in the category of Yoga. The reason for this is that when conducive causes are available, all those actions become conducive to liberation, i.e., Dharma-vyāpāra. On the other hand, no matter how many conducive causes are available, actions performed during the Acarmapudgala-lapravṛtta-kāla are not conducive to liberation.

**Means and Stages of Yoga:**

In the Pātañjala-darśana, (1) Abhyāsa and (2) Vairāgya are the means of Yoga that are mentioned. In it, Vairāgya is also said to be of two types, namely Apar and Para. Considering Vairāgya as Yoga because it is the cause of Yoga, in Jain scriptures, Apar-vairāgya is called Atavika Dharma-saṁnyāsa and Para-vairāgya is called Ta...

The term "Swik Dharma-Sannyasa Yoga" is used. In the science of human beings, the beginning of Yoga is considered to be "Purva Seva". From "Purva Seva" comes "Adhyatma", from "Adhyatma" comes "Bhavana", from "Bhavana" comes "Dhyana" and "Samata", from "Dhyana" and "Samata" comes "Vritti-Sakshama" and from "Vritti-Sakshama" and "Vritti-Sankshaya" comes "Moksha". Therefore, "Vritti-Sankshaya" is the main Yoga and all the religious activities from "Purva Seva" to "Samata" are considered as "Upaya" or means. "Ashtava", who is eager to abandon "Mithyatva" and is facing "Samyak-Darshan", has "Purva Seva" in a "Tattvik" form and "Sakathandhak", "Sindhak" etc. have "Purva Seva" in an "Atattvik" form. "Adhyatma" and "Bhavana" are "Apunarvasyak" and "Samyam-Ashti" is "Tattvik" in "Vyavahar-Nay" and "Desha-Vriti" and "Sarva-Virati" are "Tattvik" in "Nischya-Nay". In the "Gunasthanas" of "Aparamatta", "Sarva-Virati" etc., "Dhyana" and "Samata" are "Sattvik" in nature after "Japtar". "Vritti-Sankshaya" is...
* "The first characteristic of Dharma-Sannyasa is the arising of the vision of the defects of the objects. The second characteristic of Swik Dharma-Sannyasa is the arising of indifference towards the objects due to the contemplation of the truth, which is preceded by the first characteristic. "Vairagya" is where even the Dharma that reduces the "Kshaya" is destroyed and the "Kshayika" arises. This is our principle." - Shri Yashvijayji-Krit Patanjali-Darshan-Vritti, Pad 10, Sutra 16.
+"Purva Seva is the Yoga, the worship of the Guru and the Devata. Good conduct, austerity, liberation, and hatred are said to be the four." - 1
- "Purva Seva is the "Darani-Shika". * "In this, the previous ones are considered as "Upaya", only "Manas" remains. The "Gunasthanas" after "Tap" are considered as "Upaya" - this is the position." - 31

## Explanation of Terms like 'Purvaseva' etc.:

[1] Worship of the Guru, Dev, and other worthy beings, good conduct, austerity, and aversion to liberation, this is called 'Purvaseva'. [2] Thoughtful contemplation of the essence of scriptures according to the teachings, with a feeling of devotion, while practicing Anuvrat and Mahavrata as appropriate, this is 'Adhyatma'. [3] Increasingly intellectual practice of Adhyatma is 'Bhavana'. [4] Focused, subtle understanding of a single subject, free from distractions, this is 'Dhyana'. [5] Dispassionately recognizing the nature of desirable and undesirable things, which are imagined by the mind, i.e., abandoning the feeling of 'mine' and 'not mine' and adopting indifference, this is 'Samata'. [6] Complete eradication of the tendencies arising from the union of mind and body, which are in the form of fluctuations and actions, this is 'Vrittisankshaya'.

Shri Yashovijayji Upadhyay, in his commentary on Patanjali Sutras, has given a more detailed explanation of the term "Vrittisankshaya" than the one mentioned. In it, he has explained "Buti" as the reduction of the ability to experience the karmic combination, which starts from the first and ends in the fourteenth Gunasthan. This reduction is called "Vrittisankshaya". He has included "Samprajnat" in the first twelve "Medas" and "Asamprajnat" in the last two "Medas" before "Shukladhyan".
Yogic Powers:
-
Patanjali Darshan describes many powers related to knowledge, mental strength, verbal strength, and physical strength that arise from Yoga. In Jain scriptures, "Vaikalyabuddhi", "Aharakalabdhi", "Avadhigyan", "Manahparyaya", "Gyana", etc. are described as Siddhis, which are the fruits of Yoga.

In Buddhist philosophy, too, there are stages of existence like Samsara, Moksha, etc. Therefore, it is natural for it to describe the gradual spiritual development. Buddhist texts describe the state of being inclined towards one's true nature to the state of attaining the ultimate perfection of one's true nature, which is

The path is divided into five stages. Their names are: (1) Dharmanusari, (2) Sotapanna, (3) Sakadagami, (4) Anagami, and (5) Arhat. (1) Of these, 'Dharmanusari' or 'Shraddhanusari' is called one who is facing the path of Nirvana, i.e., the path of liberation, but has not attained it. This is called 'Marganusari' in Jain scriptures and its thirty-five qualities are described. (2) Due to the gradual development of the Marmas who have attained the path of liberation, there are stages like Sotapanna etc. The Marma who is Avinipata Dharma, Nimit and Sambhosiprayan is called 'Sotapanna'. The Sotapanna soul attains liberation in the seventh birth. (3) 'Sakadagami' is called one who is going to attain liberation after taking birth in this world only once. (4) One who is born in this world and goes directly to liberation from the Brahma world is called 'Anagami'. (5) One who destroys all the karmas and becomes accomplished is called 'Arhat'.

The description of the above mentioned stages of Dharmanusari etc. is very clearly given in the Manikya Manikaya. It is described that just as a calf, a little bigger but confused calf, an adult calf, a strong bull fit for plowing, and a full-grown bull cross the oblique flow of the Ganges river with increasing effort, ...

In the same way, those who follow the Dharma, the aforementioned five types of Asma can also conquer the bag of Mara-Kama with progressively less effort.

Ten restraints-bonds are described in the Buddhist scriptures. Of these, five are called 'Orabhagaya' and five 'Udbhagaya'. The first is the destruction of the Soma restraints, but it remains. After that, with the weakening of raga, dvesha and moha, the Sakda-Gadhi state is attained. When the five Orabhagaya restraints are destroyed, the Aupapatik Anaavrittidharma or Anaagami state is attained, and when all ten restraints are destroyed, Arhathood is attained. This description is similar to the description of the destruction of karma-natures in Jainsastra. The consideration of the aforementioned four states of Sotapanna, etc., is similar to the consideration of the Gunasthanas from the fourth to the fourteenth, or in other words, the aforementioned four states are merely a summary of the fourth, etc., Gunasthanas.
Just as there is a description of Labdhikas in Jainsastra, so also in Maushasastra there is a description of Siddhis, which are called 'Abhita' and are six in number, of which five are Lokik and one is Aloka.
In Yogadarshana, the spiritual development of Yogavibhuti is described. Such Aloka are called:
*
(1) Sakkaryadi, (2) Vichikiccha, (3) Silabbat Paramas, (4) Kamarag, (5) Pati, (6) Ruparaga (7) Arupraga (8) Mana, (9) Udhanta and (10) Avijja.

In Buddhist scriptures, the characteristics of a Bodhisattva are described, while in Jain scriptures, the characteristics of a Samyak-Ashtika are outlined. The one who has attained Samyak-Ashtika, even if engaged in worldly activities like household rituals and ceremonies, remains unaffected, like a foot placed on hot iron, trembling or experiencing pain. Similarly, in Buddhist scriptures, a Bodhisattva is described as being affected only by the body (Kaya-Pati) and not by the mind (Chitta) when involved in worldly activities. They are not affected by the mind (Chitta-Pati). 
-
Thus.
* "Kama-Pati are these Bodhisattvas, as declared. Their mind, even in the case of Devadatta, is wise." (1271)
-
"And thus, the characteristics of a Bodhisattva, as described earlier, are also applicable here when considered carefully. (10) If their conduct is like that of a foot placed on hot iron, (11) then they are considered to be affected by the body (Kaya-Pati) and not by the mind (Chitta-Pati)."

This other has three divisions: (1) Jivaasthan, (2) Marganaasthan and (3) Gunasyan. The first division considers eight topics related to Jivaasthan. Namely: (1) Gunasthan, (2) Yoga, (3) Upayoga, (4) Leshya, (5) Bandha, (6) Ujya, (7) Uchorana and (8) Satya. The second division discusses six topics on Marganaasthan: (1) Jivaasthan, (2) Gunasthan, (3) Yoga, (4) Upayoga, (5) Leshya and (6) Alpavasva. The third division describes twelve topics related to Gunasthan: (1) Jivasyal, (2) Yoga, (3) Upayoga, (4) Lenya, (5) Banvahe, (6) Andha, (7) Ubaya, (8) Uvirana, (9) Satya, (10) Alpamatva, (11) Bhava and (12) Sankhyat etc. Sankhya.

These verses are in the Srijiva Vijayaji-krit and Sri Jayasomasuri-krit Tave. In their place, the following three verses are also in the ancient Chaturtha Karmaanya Harimdri Tika, Sri Devendra Suri-krit Svopagna Tika and Sri Jayasomasuri-krit Tave:

## Explanation of Jiva-sthana and other topics | (1) The subtle types (differences) of Jivas, such as Bahir etc., are called 'Jiva-sthana'. The 'Jiva' is that which holds the Dravya and Bhava Pranas. The five senses, three Valas, breathing and lifespan, these ten are Prathama-Pranas, because they are large and Karma-abhyas. Knowledge, perception etc. are Paryayas, which are the functions of the Jiva's organs, these are Bhava-Pranas. This explanation of the Jiva is with respect to the Samsari state, because the Jiva-sthana includes only Samsari Jivas. Therefore, it does not apply to liberated Jivas.

##  (2) In the fourteen Gunasthana, the original purity is in the first. The Jiva's qualities are combined, and there are many types of bondage. 

## (3) In the fourteen Gunasthana, the Jiva's qualities are combined, and there are many types of bondage. The bondage is due to the arising of the Uddirana, and there are ten types of bondage.

## (1) - In the Digambara literature, the term 'Jiva-samasa' is also used in the sense of Jiva-sthana. Its explanation is as follows:

## (70) Those by which many Jivas and their many species are known, are called 'Jiva-samasa'.

## (71) And so, in the case of Badar, Paryapt and each pair, when the Aviruddha Karma (such as Aviruddha Sthavar from the subtle) arises, the Jati Karma arises, and the state that occurs in common Jivas is called 'Jiva-samasa'.

## Jiva-kanda |

The similarity between the past and present of a single object, even though it has many states over time, is called 'Urdhva-samanya'. The opposite of this, the similarity between many objects at the same time, is called 'Tiryak-samanya'.

It is possible. In a liberated soul, the contemplation done with certainty decreases. For example: the one who has the 'netana' quality is called 'Jiva' etc.
(2) The places (subjects) of the retention of the qualities, yoga, use etc. of 'margana' are called 'margana-sthana'. The various types of 'paryaya' of the Jiva, such as the sense organs, are such places, therefore they are called 'margana-sthana'.
(3) The different forms of the Jiva, which are caused by the purity and impurity of the qualities like knowledge, conduct, character etc., are called 'guna-sthana'. 1 "Tikkale cha pana, indiyabal mauaanpana yo. Bavahara si jivo, nicchamanayado duvedana jassa ||3||"
Dravya Sangraha. 2 This is also stated in Gommatasar-Jivakanda:
"Jah va jasu va jiva, magijjate jaha taha dicha. Tao chodham jane, suyanane magani hoti. ||140||"
The 'paryaya' through which or in which the contemplation of the Jivas is done according to the omniscient, the vision, are 'margana-sthana'.
_ In Gommatasar, 'vistara', 'adesh' and 'vishesh' are considered to be synonyms of 'margana-sthana'.  Jina, Ga. 3. 3 Its explanation is given in Gommatasar-Jivakanda as follows:
"Jehi du lakkhijjate, udayadisus sambhavehim bhavahhim.
Jaova te gunas pranaa, nihittha sanad rasihi. |||" Darshanamohaniya tadha charitramohaniya ke audayak adi jin bhavo (paryayo) bya dvara jiva ka bodh hota hai, ve bhav 'guna-sthana' hai.
In Gommatasar, 'sankshep', 'odh', 'samanya' and 'jivasamaas' are synonyms of 'guna-sthana'.  -Ji. Ga. 3 and 10.

---------------------------
The states of *Jiva-sthana*, *Margana-sthana*, and *Guna-sthana* are all states of the soul, but they differ in the following ways:

* *Jiva-sthana* is associated with the *Jati-namakarma*, *Paryapta-namakarma*, and *Aparyapta-namakarma*.
* *Margana-sthana* is associated with the *namakarma*, *mohaniya*, *jnanaavaraneya*, *darshanavaraneya*, and *bevanya-karma* in their *audhayika* and *parinamik* forms.
* *Guna-sthana* is associated only with the *mohaniya-karma* in its *audhayika*, *kshayopashamic*, *opashamic*, and *kshayik* forms, and with *yoga* in its *bhaava-abhaava* form.

(4) The activity of the *chetana-shakti* in the form of *bodha* is called *upayoga*. It is the extraordinary nature of the soul, through which the general and specific nature of an object is known.

(5) The *yoga* is the movement (vibration) in the realms of the soul caused by the *shriya-shakti* through the *mana*, *vachan*, or *kaya*.

(6) The natural state of the soul is pure like a crystal. The different results that occur due to the influence of specific *pudgalas* with different colors like black, blue, etc., are called *leshya*.

(7) The relationship between the realms of the soul and the *karma-pudgalas*, which is like that of milk and water, is called *bandha*. It occurs due to reasons like *nat*, *mithyatva*, etc.

1. This explanation is found in the *Gommatasar Jivakanda*.
"The *upayoga* of the soul is the *bhaava* that arises due to the *batthu-nimitta*.
That is called *gayashya*, *sayara*, *chaitrya*, and *naayara*." (671)

2. See Appendix 'K'.

3. "This result of the soul is due to the *krishnadi-syachivya*.
It is called *leshya*, just like the crystal."

This is an ancient verse. It was taken by Shriharibhadrasuri as a proof in the *Aavashyak Tika* on page 6.

---------------------------
(8) The experience of the fruition of bound karma-valikas is called "udaya". Sometimes it happens when the language period is complete, and sometimes it happens before the fixed unhindered period is complete, due to "apna" and "karan".
(9) The act of pulling out karma-dalikas that have not yet reached their udayakala, from their current state and placing them in the upalika, by special effort, is called "udirana".
(10) The karma-pudgal, which has been transformed into a particular karma-rupa due to "bandhan" or "san-kram-an" karana, remains in that form without undergoing transformation due to "nirjara" or "san-kram", is called "sarat".
1 - The period until a bound karma comes into udaya is called "aba-dha-kala".
2 - The reduction of the previous bound state and rasa, mis-virya-shakti of karma, is called "apna-karan".
3 - The particular virya by which karma is bound is called "bandhan-karan".
4 - The particular virya by which one karma transforms into another karma of the same type is called "san-kram-an-karan".
5 - The separation of karma-pudgalas from the atma-pradeshas is called "nirjara".
6 - The change of the nature, state, anubhaga and pradesha of a karma-rupa into another karma-rupa of the same type is called "san-kram".
7 - These are the characteristics of bandha, udaya, udirana and satta, in order, as described in the ancient fourth karma-grantha commentary:
"Jiva-st-pung-gal-an-va-jug-gan-pat-par-am-ame-evam

Page #78:
---------------------------
(11) The karmic pudgala, which is fit for karma due to the false, non-Jain, and Vaibhashika results, becomes transformed into the form of karma. These results are called 'bandhahetu'.
(12) The mutual increase or decrease in the nature of substances is called 'alpbahutva'. (13) The natural or inherent state of the jiva and ajeeva is called 'bhaava'.
(14) Sankhyat, asankhyat, and anant are the three technical terms.

**The order of the topics**

The first topic is the Jiva-sthana because it is the most important. All other topics, such as the Margana-sthana, are considered in relation to the Jiva. The next topic is the Margana-sthana, which means that the practical or ultimate nature of the Jiva can be understood through some kind of motion or other Paryaya (through the Margana-sthana). After the Margana-sthana, the Guna-sthana is introduced, which means that the Jivas who are in the Margana-sthana are also present in some Guna-sthana.

"
Karma is born from the special cause of the world,
Which is the strongest in its rise, entering and becoming. || 32 ||

Bondage is the lotus-like base, the self is imperishable.
Liberation is the lotus, the possibility is the essence. || 33 ||

1- The karmic results of the soul are 'Vaibhavik results', such as anger, etc.

3- See further in verse 73 onwards.

---------------------------
The instruction of "Upayoga" after "Gunasthan" implies that "Gunasthan" is possible only in those who are "Upayoga-van" (capable of using). It is not possible in "Akasha" (sky) etc. which are not "Upayoga-shugya" (capable of being used). The statement of "Yoga" after "Upayoga" means that without "Upayoga" (using), one cannot "Karma-grahan" (acquire karma). For example: "Siddh" (liberated soul). The statement of "Leshya" after "Yoga" is made with the intention that even in the "Karma-pubgala" (karma particles) acquired through "Yoga", the formation of "Sthitibandh" (state bondage) and "Anubhagbandh" (experience bondage) is due to "Leshya" only. The instruction of "Bandh" after "Leshya" means that those beings who are "Leshya-sahit" (possessing Leshya) can "Karma-bandh" (bind karma). By stating "Alpamatva" (minor importance) after "Bandh", the author means that those beings who "Bandh" (bind karma), while present in "Marganasthan" (path of liberation) etc., are bound to be "Nyunaadhik" (lesser or greater) among themselves. The statement of "Bhav" (feeling) after "Alpamatva" means that those beings who are "Alpamatva-vale" (possessing minor importance) are found to have "Aupashmik Pradhi" (temporary dominance) of some feeling or the other. The statement of "Sanspat" (contact) etc. after "Bhav" implies that the "Alpamatva" (minor importance) that exists between beings who have "Bhav" (feeling) can only be described through "Sanspat" (contact), "Apsyat" (attraction), and "Aavi" (number).

These seven types are further divided into two categories: Pāryāpta (sufficient) and Apāryāpta (insufficient).  Therefore, the total number of Jiva Sthānas (categories) is fourteen. ||2||
Bhāvartha- Here, fourteen Jiva Sthānas are described, which are related to the worldly state of the Jiva.  Although all Jivas share the common characteristic of Jivatva (being a living being), they are infinite in number from an individual perspective.  Their karmic states are also infinite.  Therefore, it is not easy for an individual to gain knowledge about them.  Hence, the special scholars have categorized them into fourteen groups based on their Sukshma Ekendriya nature and their birth.  All worldly Jivas are included in these fourteen groups.
Sukshma Ekendriya Jivas are those who have the emergence of Sukshma Nāmakarma.  Such Jivas are present throughout the universe.  Their bodies are so subtle that...

## Karmagrantha Part Four

It is said that even if these beings gather in countless numbers, they cannot be seen: therefore, they are considered unfit for interaction.

Bavar are one-sensed beings, who have the karma called "Bavar" arising. These beings are not found in any particular part of the world; for example, in inanimate objects like silver, etc. Although earth-bodied, etc., Bavar one-sensed beings are such that they do not have separate bodies, eyes, etc.; however, their physical manifestation is such that they appear in a collective form. This is why they are considered fit for interaction.

The sense organ of subtle or dense one-sensed beings is only touch. Such beings are only the five types of stationary beings, like earth-bodied, etc.

There are two-sensed beings, who have touch and tongue as their sense organs; such beings are snails, clams, worms, etc.

Three-sensed beings have touch, tongue, and nose as their sense organs. Such beings are bedbugs, etc.

Four-sensed beings have the aforementioned three sense organs plus eyes. Bees, scorpions, etc., are counted among four-sensed beings.

Five-sensed beings have the aforementioned four sense organs plus the sense of mind. Humans, animals, birds, etc., are five-sensed beings. There are two types of five-sensed beings: (1) Asanjee and (2) Sanjee. Asanjee are those who do not have consciousness. Sanjee are those who have consciousness. Here, consciousness refers to that mental power by which one can contemplate the nature of an object and its past and future.

From one-sensed to five-sensed, all types of beings are both Bavar and Bas (moving).

There are two types of beings: (a) **Aparāpta** (inadequate) and (b) **Parāpta** (adequate). (a) **Aparāpta** are those who experience the **Aparāpta Nāmakarma** (inadequate name-karma). (b) **Parāpta** are those who experience the **Parāpta Nāmakarma** (adequate name-karma). ||2||

(1 - **Guṇasthāna** in **Jīvasthāna**.)

**Bāvara-ekendriya**, **Asanṇivi-pañcendriya**, and **Vikalendriya** (inadequate) have the first and second **Guṇasthāna**. **Sanṇivi-pañcendriya** (inadequate) can have the first, second, and fourth **Guṇasthāna**. **Sanṇivi-pañcendriya** (adequate) can have all **Guṇasthāna**. The remaining seven **Jīvasthāna** - **Aparāpta** and **Parāpta** **Sūkṣma-ekendriya**, **Parāpta** **Bāhira-ekendriya**, **Parāpta** **Asanṇi-pañcendriya**, and **Parāpta** **Vikalendriya** - have only the first **Guṇasthāna**. ||3||

**Meaning:** **Bāvara-ekendriya**, **Asanṇivi-pañcendriya**, and the three **Vikalendriya** - these five **Aparāpta** **Jīvasthāna** have two **Guṇasthāna**. However, it is important to understand that the second **Guṇasthāna** occurs in **Karaṇa-Aparāpta** (inadequate in terms of action), not in **Aparāpta** (inadequate in general). This is because a being with **Sāsthāvana-samyagdṛṣṭi** (perfect vision) is not born as **Aparāpta**. Therefore, **Karaṇa**...

**Regarding the five states of existence, namely, the insufficient *Bādar* one-sensed, etc., the first *guṇasthāna* should be understood in the two *guṇasthāna*s of the insufficient *Bādar* one-sensed, etc., and in the *āvi* and *poṣa*s.**

**The *guṇasthāna*s mentioned in the *Bādar* one-sensed are not in all *Bādar* one-sensed, but only in the earth-bodied, water-bodied, and plant-bodied. Because the fire-bodied and air-bodied beings, even if they are *Bādar*, do not have the possibility of such a result that a being with *sāsāvān* *samyak* can be born in them. Therefore, the first *guṇasthāna* should be understood in the *Bāyar* fire-bodied and air-bodied, similar to the subtle.**

**In this place, the statement of finding two *guṇasthāna*s in the one-sensed is according to the opinion of the *karma* *pratyakṣa*; because in the principle, the one-sensed is considered to have only the first *guṇasthāna*.**

**Understanding**

**"The three *guṇasthāna*s mentioned in the insufficient *saṁjñi* five-sensed are in this respect that when a being dies with the fourth *guṇasthāna* and is born as a *saṁjñi* five-sensed, then it is possible for him to have the fourth *guṇasthāna* in the insufficient state. In this way, the being who, abandoning *samyak* and being present in the *sāsāvān* state, is born as a *saṁjñi* five-sensed, has the possibility of the second *guṇasthāna* until the body is fully sufficient, and all other *saṁjñi* five-sensed beings have the first *guṇasthāna* in the insufficient state.**

**Possible Explanation of the Gunasthanas in the Context of Karana-Aparayapta**

It is not possible to explain the Gunasthanas in the context of Labdhi-Aparayapta, because the necessary qualifications are not present in the state of Labdhi-Aparayapta.

All Gunasthanas are considered to be present in the state of Sanji-Panchendriya. This is because a human being in the womb, who has the potential for all kinds of auspicious and inauspicious, pure and impure results, can attain all four Gunasthanas. They are Sanji-Panchendriya.

**Doubt:** It may be doubted that there are only twelve Gunasthanas in Sanji-Panchendriya, and not the thirteenth and fourteenth Gunasthanas. This is because the Sanji-svabhaava is absent during these Gunasthanas. At that time, due to the presence of Kshayika-Jnana, there is no Kshayopaashaamik-Jnanaatmaka-Sanjna, which is also called 'Bhaavaman'.

**Resolution:** The statement that the thirteenth and fourteenth Gunasthanas are present in Sanji-Panchendriya is made in relation to Dravyaman, accepting the presence of Sanji-svabhaava. However, in relation to Bhaavaman, there are only twelve Gunasthanas in Sanji-Panchendriya.

**Karana-Aparayapta:** In Sanji-Panchendriya, the first, second, fourth, sixth, and thirteenth Gunasthanas are considered to be Karana-Aparayapta.

**Karmgranth:** The Karmgranth mentions three Gunasthanas in Karana-Aparayapta Sanji-Panchendriya, considering the state of Aparayapta at the time of birth.

**Gommatasar:** The Gommatasar mentions five Gunasthanas, considering both the state of Aparayapta at the time of birth and the state of Aparayapta at the time of attainment.

**Reconciliation:** These two statements are not contradictory, as they are relative to each other.

**Labdhi-Aparayapta:** If we consider the Gunasthanas in Sanji-Panchendriya in the context of Labdhi-Aparayapta, then the fifth Gunasthanas should also be counted. This is because the state of Aparayapta is present in the fifth Gunasthanas when the body is formed due to the attainment of Vikriya-Labdhi.

**Confirmation:** This point is clarified by the following verse from the Saptaatikaani:

Karmagrantha Part Four
The results of the remaining seven jiva-sthānas, which are insufficient and sufficiently subtle, are so complex that in birth, there is no time for any other guna-sthāna except mithyātva. ||3||
"Even in the case of the kevali, there is dravyamāna. Therefore, they are called sanjī, but they are not sanjī in relation to mano-jñāna."
Even the kevali has dravyamāna. Therefore, they are called sanjī, but they are not sanjī in relation to mano-jñāna. In the kevali state, the use of sanjītvam in relation to dravyamāna is also accepted in the Gommatasāra Jīvakāṇḍa. For example:
"The speech of those who have manas is considered to be like a bit of a fruit. This is because, in the earlier guna-sthānas, speech is seen in those who have manas. ||227||
"The ango-angadaya-do, the vasvam-apatta jini vacamhi. Maṇavaragaṇa khaṇṣāṇa, āgamana do maṇa jōgo. ||228||
Even though there is no manas in the saṁyogi-āvali guna-sthāna, it is considered to be manas by way of upacāra because of the presence of speech. The reason for this upacāra is that in the earlier guna-sthānas, speech is seen in those who have manas. ||22||
Jinesvara also has the arrival of the skandhas of mano-vagaṇā due to the rise of the ango-angadaya nāma-vaman for dravyamāna. Therefore, he is called mano-yoga. ||22||

Bhavartha - In the aforementioned six Aparyapt states of beings, Sukhma Ekendriya etc., Karman and Oudarikamishra are considered to be the two yogas. The reason for this is that all types of beings have Karmanyoga in the interval motion and at the first time of birth-taking; because at that time, due to the absence of Oudarik etc. gross body, the yoga tendency is only from the Karman body. But from the second time of birth until the completion of the appropriate pariaptis, there is a mixed yoga; because in that state, Karman and Oudarik etc.

## English Translation:

"The gross body helps in the development of the Audārika Yoga." The first six stages of existence are all characterized by having an Audārika body. In the state of insufficiency, after the Kārmāṇaka Yoga, there is the Audārika Miśra Kāya Yoga. The aforementioned stages of existence have been described as insufficient. This insufficiency should be understood in terms of both method and cause.

The insufficient Sanji-Pañcendriya includes humans, Tiryak Devas, and Narakas. Therefore, in this stage, after the Kārmāṇaka Yoga and Kārmāṇakāya Yoga, there are three types of Yoga: Audārika Miśra Kāya Yoga in relation to humans and Niryancha, and Kriya Miśra Kāya Yoga in relation to Devas and Narakas.

The alternative view mentioned in the verse is that of the Shīlāṅka and other Āchāryas. Their view is that when the body becomes fully sufficient, it becomes complete. Therefore, even if other sufficient beings are not complete, when the body becomes fully sufficient, the Miśra Yoga ceases to exist. However, those with Audārika bodies experience Audārika Kāya Yoga, and those with Kriya bodies experience Vaikriya Kāya Yoga.

According to this alternative view, in the six insufficient stages of existence, namely Sūkṣma Ekendriya, etc., there are three types of Yoga: Kārmāṇ, Audārika Miśra, and Audārika.

"Audārika Yoga is for humans and Tiryak Devas, when the body becomes fully sufficient, then it is Miśra." Āchārāṅga - Adhyāya 2, U 1, Commentary, page 24. Although the verse mentions "Uralam", it is indicative of Vaikriya Kāya Yoga. Therefore, Kriya-bodied Devas and Narakas should be understood to experience Vaikriya Kāya Yoga in the state of insufficiency after their bodies become fully sufficient.

This alternative view has been elaborated upon by Shriman Nirji in the Vṛtti of Pañchasangraha, Dwā 1, Gā 6-7, based on an ancient Gāthā.

## Karmagrantha Part Ghar

"In the **Aparyapt Sanshi-Panchendriya**, the three (**Karman**, **Audarik**, and **Vaishyamishra**) and **Kriya** should be understood as **Kula Pani Yoga**."

Regarding the above mentioned different opinions, it is written in **Tifa** that this opinion is **Yuktihon** (logical). Because, just by becoming **Sharira Paryapt** (body complete), the body does not become complete; but for its completeness, it is necessary for all the **Strogya** (strength) **Paryaptis** (completions) to become complete. Therefore, even after **Sharira Paryapt**, it is appropriate to consider **Mishra Yoga** until the **Aparyapt-Ashasta** (incomplete-eight) state. ||4||

**Sanche Sanipajatate, Uralam Suhame Sabhasu Tam Chausu. Bayari Saviutiyadurg, Pajas Nisubar Uvaoga.** ||5||
**Sayen Sanshini Paryapt Audarikam Saksme Sabhas Tatchatusu. Badare Sarv Kiyadi Kang, Paryaptasanjishu Dwadashoupayoga.** ||5||

**Meaning:** All **Yogas** are found in **Paryapt Sanji** (complete-five-sense). In **Paryapt Sukshma-Ekendriya** (complete-subtle-one-sense), only **Audarik Kayayoga** exists. In **Paryapt Vikalendriya-Nik** (complete-impaired-sense-near) and **Paryapt Asaji-Panchendriya** (complete-imperfect-five-sense), these four **Jiva** (living being) states, **Audarik** and **Asatyamrishamachana**, these two **Yogas** exist. In **Paryapt Vavar-Ekendriya** (complete-large-one-sense), **Audarik**, **Kriya**, and **Niyamin**, these three **Karayogas** exist. (Uses in **Jiva** states): All **Jamyogas** are found in **Paryapt Sanji-Panchendriya**. ||5||

**Bhavarth:** "In **Paryapt Sanji-Panchendriya**, all six **Paryaptis** exist," therefore its **Yogya** (competence) is of a special kind. Therefore, it has all four **Bachan Yogas**, all four **Manoyogas**, and all seven **Kayayogas**.

"Although **Karman**, **Audarik Mishra**, and **Vaishyamishra**, these three **Yogas** are **Aparyapt-Avastha-Bhaavi** (incomplete-state-future), they are also found in **Sanshi-Panchendriya** in the **Paryapt-Avastha** (complete-state)." **Karman** and **Audarik Mishra Kayayoga** exist in the **Paryapt-Avastha** when **Kevali Bhagwan** (liberated soul) creates **Keli-Samuha** (group of games).

## Karmagrantha Part 12

**There are eight time-proof conditions in the Kevali ocean. In the third, fourth, and fifth times, there is Karman Kayayoga, and in the second, sixth, and seventh times, there is Audarik Mishrakayayoga.**

**Vaikriya Mishrakayayoga is determined in the Paryapt state when a Vaikriya-labdhi-dhari Muni, etc., creates a Vaikriya-sharira.**

**The holders of Aharak Kayayoga and Aharak Mishrakayayoga are the Chaturdashadhar Munis.** They have Aharak Mishrakayayoga when they create and abandon the Aharak Sharira, and Aharak Kayayoga when they hold that body.

**The holders of Audarik Kayayoga are all Samyaktva-paryapt humans, and the holders of Tiryanch and Vaikriya Kayayoga are Paryapt Devas and Narakas.**

**18**

**The Sukshma Ekendriya is considered to have Audarikayoga in the Paryapt state.** This is because it does not have a union of mind and speech, nor does it have Vaikriya, etc., labdhi. Therefore, Vaikriya Kayayoga, etc., is not possible in it.

**In the four jiva-sthans of Dindriya, Shridriya, Chaturindriya, and Asanjnin Panchendriya, the Paryapt state has Vyavahar-bhasha-asatyamrsh-bhasha because they have a mouth.** Kayayoga in them is Audarik. Therefore, only two yogas are mentioned in them.

**1 - This is what Bhagwan Umaswati has said:**

**"Audarik-prayokta prathama-ashta-mas-mayayayarema-avishta. Mishra-oudaritrayokta saptama-pasht-dvitiyeshu.**

**Karman-daryash-yogi, chaturtha-ke-panchame-trtiye-cha. Samayatrave'pi tasmin bhavati-anaha-rako-niyamat."**

**Mother - One-sensed beings - Five stationary beings:** In the adequate state, there are three yogas considered: Audarik, Vaikriya, and Kriyamishra. Of these, Audarikayoga is present in all types of one-sensed beings in the adequate state, but this is not the case with Vaikriya. Vaikriya yoga is only present in the **Barvaayu** body; because **Barvaayu** beings obtain Vaikriya. When they create a Kriya body, they should understand this as Kriyamishraka usage and Vaikriya body being fully present. Their Vaikriya body is considered to be flag-shaped.

**1 - "Bhachan Tiryanch Manusyaan, Devanarako Parm. Keshamchil Labdhim Advaayu, Sanjnityam Nrunam Api."**

**1a - Lokaprakash Sarga 3:** The first (Audarik) body is present in Tiryanch and humans; the second (Vaikriya) body is present in Devas, Narakas, beings with Vaayu body who have obtained Vaikriya, and beings with Sanjni Tiryanch-human body who have obtained Vaikriya. The fact that Vaayu body beings have a Vaikriya body obtained through **Labdhi** is not clear in the **Lattvarth** मूल and its commentary, but it is mentioned in the commentary's **Diwa**.

**"Vayoshcha Vaikriyam Labdhpratyayameva"** etc. - **Swarth A. 2048** commentary. There is a special feature in Digambari literature. In it, **Tejas** body beings are also said to be the owners of a Vaikriya body, similar to Vaayu body beings. Although no mention of the Vaikriya body of **Tejas** body and Vaayu body beings is found in **Sarvarth Siddhi**, it is present in **Rajavartika**.

**"Kriyikam Devanarakaanam Tejovaayu Kayik Panchendriya Tiryanch Manusyaanam Cha Keshamchit."** - **Tattvarth A. 2, Su. 46, Rajavartika 8.** The same thing is also present in **Gommatsar Jeevakanda**: "**Badarateubaau, Panchidia Punnama Vigubvanti. Or Liye Sariram, Vigurunapavam Have Jesi.**"

(3) - Uses in the realms of living beings.

All uses are found in the beings with complete five senses (Saṃśipāñcendriya). Because the human beings born from the womb (Garbhaja-manushya), in whom all types of uses are possible, are Saṃśipāñcendriya. There are twelve uses, of which five are knowledge (Jnana) and three are ignorance (Ajñana), these eight are concrete (Vishesharupa), and four are abstract (Samanyarupa). Of these, only knowledge and only abstract uses are considered to be present for a moment (Sthiti Samaya), and the remaining ten concrete uses are considered to be present for a very short time (Antamuhurta).

## Part Four

Due to the closeness and the first being the Gunasthan, they do not have any other general uses except for Achakṣudarśana and Adhakṣuvaṁśa, and no other special uses except for Mati-Ahāna and Śruta-Ajñāna.

In the ten types of beings, namely Sūkṣma-Ekendriya, etc., three uses have been mentioned. However, according to the Karmagranthik view, this is not the case according to the Saiddhantic view.

1. See, Pariśiṣṭa 6.
2. The explanation is as follows: The Karmagranthik scholars consider the first and second Gunasthan in the five types of inadequate beings, namely Bādar-Ekendriya, Dwīndriya, Trīndriya, Caturindriya, and Asamjñi-Pañcendriya. See, further Ga. 5th. However, they consider Mati, etc., at the time of the second Gunasthan as ignorance, not knowledge. See, further Ga. 21st. Therefore, according to their view, in the five types of inadequate beings, namely Bādar-Ekendriya, etc., where two Gunasthan are possible, only three uses are considered: Achakṣudarśana, Mati-Ajñāna, and Śruta-Ajñāna. This is similar to the five beings, namely Paryaapta-Aparyaapta-Sakṣama-Ekendriya, Paryaapta-Bādar-Ekendriya, Paryaapta-Dwīndriya, and Paryaapta-Trīndriya, which have the first Gunasthan.

However, the Saiddhantic scholars have a different opinion. They say that "in any type of Ekendriya, whether it is Paryaapta or Aparyaapta, Sūkṣma or Bādar, there is no other Gunasthan except the first. See, Ga. 46th. But in the four inadequate beings, namely Dwīndriya, Trīndriya, Caturindriya, and Asamjñi-Pañcendriya, there are two Gunasthan, the first and the second." At the same time, the Saiddhantic scholars consider Mati, etc., at the time of the second Gunasthan as knowledge, not ignorance. See, Ga. 46th. Therefore, according to their view, in the said twelve inadequate beings, namely Dwīndriya, etc., there are five uses: Achakṣudarśana, Mati-Ajñāna, Mati-Jñāna, and Śruta-Jñāna. And in the ten beings, namely Sūkṣma-Ekendriya, etc., except for the four beings, namely Dwīndriya, etc., there are three uses in the remaining six beings: Achakṣudarśana, Mati-Ajñāna, and Śruta-Ajñāna.

## Karmavanya Part Four

The five senses with consciousness (Sanji-Panchendriya) are not used in the imperfect state. This is because:

* **Tiryak** and **Samyak** Devas, Narakas, etc., have knowledge and two types of vision from the moment of their birth.
* **Mithyatvi** Devas, Narakas, etc., have three types of ignorance and two types of vision from the moment of their birth.

The four uses of **Manas-paryaya** (mental perception), etc., are not possible because:

* **Manas-paryaya** can only be attained by those who practice **Samyama** (self-control), which is not possible in the imperfect state.
* **Chakshus-darshan** (visual perception) requires the functioning of the **Dhatu-indriya** (physical senses), which is not present in the imperfect state.
* **Kevalgyan** (perfect knowledge) and **Kevaldarshan** (perfect vision) are both results of **Karma-kshaya** (destruction of karma), which is not possible in the imperfect state.

The five senses with consciousness (Sanji-Panchendriya) are said to have three uses in the imperfect state, based on the expectation of **Karan-apatti** (acquisition of the cause). This is because in the imperfect state of **Labdhi-apatti** (acquisition of the result), there are no other uses except **Mati-agyan** (intellectual ignorance), **Shruta-agyan** (scriptural ignorance), and **Acha-darshan** (wrong vision).

In this verse, **Chatur-darshan** (four types of vision) is not included in the uses of the imperfect **Chatur-indriya** (four senses), imperfect **Asanji-Panchendriya** (five senses without consciousness), and imperfect **Sanji-Panchendriya** (five senses with consciousness). This is according to a different opinion. Because, according to the opinion of the **Paksha-sangrahakar** (compiler of the arguments), in the imperfect state of these three types of beings, **Indriya-paryapti** (perfection of the senses) is complete, and therefore **Chakshus-darshan** (visual perception) is also attained.

To understand the meaning of both opinions, one should refer to the note of verse 17.

**Note:**

* This is mentioned by **Shrimala-giri-muni** as follows:

"The imperfect and the conditionally perfect should be known. Otherwise, in the imperfect, even **Chakshus-darshan** (visual perception) is attained, as the **Mula-toka** (original text) states that it is attained by the **Ayina** (one who has attained perfection)." - **Pavasan** (commentary on the **Dwar** 1, **Gatha** 8).

(4-8) - Leshya-Bandha etc. in the Jiva-sthana.
{ From two Gathaas.  Sanni-duge chalesap, - jabayare padham chau ti sesesu.  Sattath bandhuvoran, santudaya att terasu. || 7 || Sanjidike sadleshya aptibhadare pradhamaschatasnatisra: sesesu.  Saptaastabandhodiran, sadudayaavastanaam krayodashasu. || 5 ||
Meaning - In the Sanji-Panchendriya, both A-pariyapt and Pariyapt, there are six Leshyas.  In the A-pariyapt Babar-eke-striya, the first four Leshyas, Krishna etc., are found.  In the remaining twelve Jiva-sthana, - A-pariyapt and Pariyapt Sukshma-ekendriya, Pariyapt Paavar-ekendriya, A-pariyapt-Pariyapt Renidhi, A-pariyapt-Pariyapt Tri-indriya, A-pariyapt-Pariyapt Chatur-indriya and A-pariyapt-Pariyapt A-sanji-Panchendriya, there are three Leshyas, Krishna, Neet and Kapoot.
Except for the Pariyapt Sanji, in the thirteen Jiva-sthana, there are seven or eight Karma-bandha and also seven or eight Udorana, but the Sajja and Uday are eight each. || 7 ||
Meaning - Both A-pariyapt and Pariyapt types of Sanji are considered to be the owners of six Leshyas, the reason being that in them, both auspicious and inauspicious results are possible.  A-pariyapt Sanji-Panchendriya means Karana-pariyapt, because in it, six Leshyas are possible.  The remaining A-pariyapt are only entitled to three Leshyas.
Krishna etc., three Leshyas are common for all Ekendriya.  But the A-pariyapt Madar-ekendriya has a special feature that it also has the Seloleshya.  Because the Jyotishi, who has the Tejoleshya, is a divine being,

## Karmagrantha Part Four

When they are filled with Leshya and are born as Badar in the Earth, Water or Plant bodies, they have Tejo Leshya in an insufficient state. It is a rule that the Leshya in which one dies is the same Leshya they take at birth.

Insufficient and sufficient subtle Ekendriya etc. are mentioned as the eleven Jiva-sthana with three Leshyas. The reason is that all these Jiva-sthana are associated with inauspicious results, therefore the previous three Leshyas, which are auspicious results, are not present in them.

The consideration of Bandha, Udirana, Satya and Uday in these Jiva-sthana is based on the Mula Prakritis. In each Jiva-sthana, at any given time, how many Prakritis are bound, how many are awakened, how many are in existence and how many are rising, is shown. 1. Bandha.

Except for the sufficient Sanjni, all types of Jivas bind seven Karma Prakritis at all times, except for Aayu. They bind all eight Karma Prakritis only when they bind Aayu. The binding of Aayu happens only once in a Bhava, until the end of the current Bhava, either in a low or high Antarmukhurta. The rule for Aayu Karma is that the third part of the current Aayu, the new

――
I
2 - The above rule applies to Jivas with Sopakram (decreasing) Aayu, not to those with Nirupakrama Aayu. If they are Deva, Naraka or countless Manushya-Tiryach, then they bind the Aayu of the next Bhava only when one month of Aayu is left. And if they are Ekendriya, Vikalendriya or Panchendriya Manushya-Tiryach, then they bind the Aayu of the next Bhava only when one-third of the current Bhava is left.
  Brihatsangrahani, Ga. 321-323, and Pancham Karmagrantha, Ga. 34.

##  Magnanth Part Four

In these twenty-seven Jhavi parts, the binding of the lifespan of the soul occurs when the soul remains in the state of being. 
According to this rule, if there is no binding, then at the end, when the present Aamu, Antarmukhut-Praman, remains, then the binding of the lifespan for the next birth is inevitable.

2. Udirana: In the thirteen types of living beings, there are eight types of Udirana at every moment. The seven types of Udirana are found in the last Aavlika of life, when there is no Udirana of lifespan. Because at that time, due to the remaining Aavlika-matra state, the present (Udayaman) Aamu, even if it becomes more stable, does not become Udayaman, and therefore, there is no Udirana for the next birth. The scriptures state this rule of Udirana: the Udirana of the karma that is Uday-prapta occurs, not of others. And when the Uday-prapta karma remains only as Aavsika-matra, then its Udirana stops.

1. "Udayavaliyabahririll Dihito Kasayaghiya Sahiyanam Jogkaranenam Daliyamakadiy Udaypattaliyen Sam Anubhavanamudirana."
   --- Karma-Prakriti-Chuni. 
   Meaning: Pulling the Dalikas situated outside the Uday-Aavlika, with or without Kasaya, through Yoga, and freeing them from that state, and experiencing them along with the Uday-prapta Dalikas, is called 'Udirana'.

The meaning of this statement is that the Dalikas within the Udayavali are not subject to Udirana. Therefore, it is according to the rule that the Udirana of karma stops when the state of karma remains only as Aavlika-matra. 

Page #98:
---------------------------
## Karmagrantha Part Four

In the thirteen types of living beings, those that are *aparyapt* (inadequate) should be understood as *ladhi-aparyapt* (inadequate in attainment), because in them, the *uvirana* (manifestation) of seven or eight karmas can occur. They die in the *aparyapt* state, therefore, when only a *alika* (moment) of life remains, the *uvirana* of seven karmas occurs, and before that, the *uvirana* of eight karmas. However, there is no rule for *karanaparyapt* (adequate in cause) beings to die in the *aparyapt* state. If they become *lakshiparyapt* (adequate in goal), they die in the *paryapt* (adequate) state. Therefore, it is not possible for them to have only a *alika* of life remaining in the *aparyapt* state and for the *uvirana* of seven karmas to occur.

3-4. **Satta** (existence) and **Uday** (arising). The existence of eight karmas is up to the eleventh *gunasthan* (stage of virtue), and the arising of eight karmas continues throughout all *gunasthanas*. However, for all types of beings except *paryapt* (adequate) *sanshi* (being), the maximum possible *gunasthanas* are the second, fourth, and fifth. Therefore, the existence and arising of eight karmas have been considered for the thirteen types of living beings.

**Satluchhegabandha, Satudaya Satatthachattari. Satsadwachpanchagam Udirna Sanippajatte. || 8 ||**

**Saptaastapadbavandha, Sadudayau Saptaastachattari.**
**Saptaastaghatpanchadwika Mudarana Sanji-Garyapte. ||**

**Meaning:** In *paryapt* *sanji* (adequate being), there are four *bandha-sthana* (stages of bondage): seven karmas, eight karmas, six karmas, and one karma. The *satta-sthana* (stage of existence) and *upay-sthana* (stage of arising) are for seven, eight, and four karmas, and the *udirna-sthana* (stage of manifestation) is for seven, eight, six, five, and two karmas. || 8 ||

**Explanation:** The group of *prakriti* (nature) that are bound together (simultaneously) is called *bandhasyan*. Similarly, the group of *prakriti* that exist...

## Chapter 28, Karma Granth Part Four

**1. Satta Sthan:** The community of natures whose arising is found together is called 'Satta Sthan'.

**2. Uvaya Sthan:** The community of natures whose arising is found together is called 'Uvaya Sthan'.

**3. Dhirana Sthan:** The community of natures whose arising is found together is called 'Dhirana Sthan'.

**4. Bandha Sthan:**

Of the above four Sthans, the Bandha Sthan of the seven Karmas is found at the time when the Bandha of Ayus (lifespan) does not occur. Once the Bandha of Ayus has occurred, the time for its destruction is 'Jghanya Antarmuhurt Praman' and 'Utkrishta Fal Antarmuhurt Karma' - a crore previous years and six months less than Tetis Sagaropama Praman. Therefore, the state of the Bandha Sthan of Karma should also be understood as the same, i.e., Jghanya Antarmuhurt Praman and Utkrishta Asattam - a crore less and six months less than Tetis Sagaropama Praman.

**5. Bandha Sthan of the Eighth Karma:**

The Bandha Sthan of the eighth Karma is found at the time of Ayus Bandha. Ayus Bandha occurs until Jghanya or Utkrishta Antarmuhurt, therefore, the Jghanya or Utkrishta state of the Bandha Sthan of the eighth Karma is Antarmuhurt Praman.

**6. Antarmuhurt:**

- Nine time Praman, ten time Praman, and so on, increasing by one time each, finally one time less than Muhurt Praman, all these types of time are called 'Antarmuhurt'. Jghanya Antarmuhurt is nine time, Utkrishta Antarmuhurt is one time less than Muhurt, and Madhyama Antarmuhurt is ten time, eleven time, etc., all the types of time in between should be understood.

- Two Ghadi (48 minutes) is called 'Muhurt'.

**7. Sagaropama and Palmopama:**

- Ten Kotakoti Pathyopamas make one 'Sagaropama', and countless years make one 'Palmopama'. (Tattvarth 4.0.15)

**8. Utkrishta Antar of Ayus Bandha:**

- When a human being with a lifespan of a crore previous years binds an Ayus of Tetis Sagaropama Praman in the third part of his lifespan, then he can bind Ayus again only after six months of the lifespan of a Deva, after binding Ayus until Antarmuhurt. From this perspective, the Utkrishta Antar of Ayus Bandha should be understood. 

Page #100:
---------------------------
## Karmagrantha Part Four

**Six Karma Bandhasthana** are found in the first six Gunasthana. This is because they do not have the Bandha of Aayu and Mohaniya, and the Bandha of Bokarma is absent. The Ips Bandhasthana should be considered as lowly as the lowest Gunasthana and as high as the highest Gunasthana. The lowly state is equivalent to a moment, and the highest state is equivalent to an Anlamuhurta.

**One Karma Bandhasthana** is found in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth Gunasthana. This is because in these Gunasthana, except for the seventh, there is no Bandha of other Karmas. The lowly state of the eleventh Gunasthana is equivalent to every moment, and the highest state is equivalent to nine years minus one crore years ago. Therefore, the state of this Bandhasthana should be understood as lowly as a moment and as high as nine years minus one crore years ago.

**6. Sattastana**

**The first Sattastana** is found in the first eleven Gunasthana. Its state is Anadi-Anant in relation to Abhavya and Anadi-Sant in relation to Bhavya. This means that the Abhavya does not have a beginning or an end to their Karma-Parampara. However, this is not the case for the Bhavya. They do not have a beginning, but they do have an end.

**The second Sattastana** is found only in the twelfth Gunasthana. This is the time it takes for the most subtle, smallest, and fastest moving atom to move from one space to another. This time is called 'Samaya'.

**The third Sattastana** is found only in the thirteenth Gunasthana. This is the time it takes for the most subtle, smallest, and fastest moving atom to move from one space to another. This time is called 'Samaya'.

**- Tattvarth Sutra 4, Sutra 15 Commentary**

**1. Samaya:** The time it takes for the most subtle, smallest, and fastest moving atom to move from one space to another.

**2. Purva:** Eighty-four lakh years is one Purvang, and eighty-four lakh Purvang is one Purva.

## Karma Granth Part Four

The **aghaanya** or **utkrusht** (excellent) state of the **Gunasthan** is considered to be **Antamuhurt** (the final moment). Therefore, the state of the **Sattaasthan** of the **Salaka** should be understood in the same way. In this **Sattaasthan**, there are 7 **Mar** (death) in the **Siyar** (cycle) of **Mohaaniya** (those who are subject to delusion).

The **Sattaasthan** of the **Chaar** (four) is found in the **Terha** (thirteenth) and **Chauvaha** (fourteenth) **Gunasthan**. Because in these two **Gunasthan**, only the **Chaar Aghaati Karma** (four non-destructive karmas) remain. Combining these two **Gunasthan**, the **utkrusht** state is **Aath Varsha Aath Maapt-Kam** (eight years eight months less) **Karod Purva-Pramaan** (previous evidence). Therefore, the **utkrusht** state of the **Salaka**'s **Sattaasthan** should be understood in the same way. Their **jghanya** (inferior) state is **Antamuhurs-Pramaan** (final moment evidence).

7. **Udayasthan**: The **Udayasthan** of the **Aath Karma** (eight karmas) resides in the first to tenth **Gunasthan**. Its state is **Anaavi-Anarat** (without beginning and without end) compared to **Abhavyas** (those who are not destined for liberation) and **Anaadi-Saant** (without beginning and peaceful) compared to **Bhavyas** (those who are destined for liberation). However, its state is **Saavi-Saant** (with beginning and peaceful) compared to the middle state of those who have fallen from **Upshamantheenis** (those who have attained the state of tranquility). After falling from the **Updhaam-Shreni** (category of higher realms), one can again attain the **Antamuhurs** category. If one cannot attain **Antamuhurs**, then one must inevitably go through **Ashta** (eight) **Apuugdala-Puravart** (cycles of rebirth) with some reduction. Therefore, the **Udayasthan** of the **Aath** should be understood as having a **Saavi-Saant** state, **jghanya** as **Antamuhurt-Pramaan** and **utkrusht** as **Vesh-Uun** (slightly less) **Ardhpurval Puravart Pramaan** (half-cycle of rebirth evidence).

The **Udayasthan** of the **Saas** (breath) is found in the eleventh and twelfth **Gunasthan**. The state of this **Udayasthan** is considered **jghanya** as **Ek Samay** (one moment) and **utkrusht** as **Antamuhurt**. The **Jiva** (soul) who dies in the eleventh **Gunasthan** after staying for only one moment and is born in the **Anuttar Vimaan** (highest celestial realm), experiences the **Uday** (arising) of the **Aath Karma** upon birth. Therefore, the **Udayasthan** of the **Saas** is considered **jghanya** as **Samay-Pramaan** (moment evidence). The **Jiva** who attains the twelfth **Gunasthan** will, at most, ... 

Page #102:
---------------------------
The *karmagrantha* experiences the arising of seven *karmas* until the state of *rasagunasthan* and the *mahaant* (great end). It definitely experiences the arising of *chhar karma* after attaining the thirteenth *gunasthan*. From this perspective, the seventh *gunasthan* is called the *utkrusht* (excellent) *ant* (end). It is found in the seventh, thirteenth, and fourteenth *gunasthan* because in these *gunasthan*s, no *karma* other than *aghatikarma* arises. The state of this *utkrusht* is *jghanya* (inferior) *antarmuhurt* (within a moment) and *utkrusht* (excellent) *besh* (more than) *un karod purv varsh* (one hundred crore previous years).

8. *Udiranasthan*. The *udiranasthan* of eight occurs at the time of *udorana* (arising) of the lifespan. The *udorana* of lifespan occurs in the first six *gunasthan*s. Therefore, this *udiranasthan* is found in these *gunasthan*s.

The *udiranasthan* of seven occurs at the time when the *udorana* of lifespan stops. The *udorana* of lifespan stops when the remaining lifespan is equal to one *avalika*. The first, second, fourth, fifth, and sixth *gunasthan*s can be found at the time of the last *avalika*. The others cannot. Therefore, the time of the *udiranasthan* of seven should be understood in these five *gunasthan*s. The *udiranasthan* of seven does not occur in the third *gunasthan* because this *gunasthan* is not possible when the remaining lifespan is equal to one *avalika*. Therefore, the *udiranasthan* of eight is considered in this *gunasthan*.

The *udiranasthan* of nine occurs from the seventh *gunasthan* until one *avalika* remains in the eighth *gunasthan*.

1. One *muhurt* is divided into 1.63, 73, 216 parts, and each part is called an *avalika*. 

Page #103:

Karmagranth Part Four

It is found. Because at that time, Ayus and Vedaniya, these two do not arise. From the last Avali of the Basva Gunasthan, where the Udaran of Mohaniya also stops, to the last Avali of the Twelfth Gunasthan, there are five Udaranasthanas.

From the last Avali of the Twelfth Gunasthan, where the Udaran of Jnanaavaran, Darshanavaran and Antaraya, three Karmas, stops, to the end of the Thirteenth Gunasthan, there are four Udaranasthanas. In the Sixteenth Gunasthan, due to the absence of Yoga, even though it is Ucchya, there is no Udaran of Nama-Gotra.

The above mentioned fifteen Gunasthanas, Sattaasthanas etc. are sufficient for understanding. Because the same being is the possessor of all the Gunasthanas. Which Gunasthan has which Anvasthan, Sasasthan, Ukyasthan and Udaranasthan. This will be discussed further in verses 56 to 62. ||

## Karmagrantha Part Four
Appendix to the First Chapter.
Appendix "K". Footnote on page 5 of "Levaya"

1. Leshya has two divisions: (a) Dravya and (b) Bhava. (a) Dravya Leshya is characterized by Pudgala. There are mainly three opinions regarding its nature: (1) Karma Vargana-Nishpanna, (2) Karma-Nishyanta, and (3) Yoga-Parinam.

1. The first opinion believes that Dravya Leshya is formed from Karma Vargana. However, it is different from the eight Karmas: it is the Karma-Sharira. This opinion is mentioned in Uttaradhyayana, A5 34, commentary, Dhru 650.

2. The second opinion suggests that Dravya Leshya is in the form of Karma Nishyanta (the flow of bound Karma). When Karma exists in the fourteenth Gunasthan, its Nishyanta leads to the absence of Leshya. This opinion is mentioned on the same page, where the commentator Badivatal Shrisantisuri writes, "Guru Vastu Vyachhakshase."

3. The third opinion is by Shriharibhadrasuri and others. This opinion is explained by Shrimalayagiri in the commentary on the Padadhana verse 17, page 330. They consider Dravya Leshya as an independent Dravya, formed from Yoga Vargana. Upadhyay Thivinayavijayaji, in his Agam-Dohaan-Roop Lokaprakash, Sarg 3, Shlok 285, accepts this opinion.

(b) Bhava Leshya is a specific result of the soul, which is obtained through Sanslesha and Yoga. Due to the various divisions of Sanslesha, such as Tivra, Tivratara, Tiyatam, Manda, Mandatara, Mamvatam, etc., Bhava Leshya is actually of countless types. However, the scriptures have shown its nature by dividing it into six parts for brevity. See, Ga 12. To understand the nature of these six divisions, the scriptures provide two examples:

First: A group of men were going to eat Jambu fruits (black plums). One of them saw a Jambu tree and said, "Look, the Jambu tree is here. Instead of climbing up for the fruits, it would be better to cut down this tree with its large branches laden with fruits."

Hearing this, another man said, "What is the benefit of cutting it down? Just cut the branches."

The third man said, "That's not right either. Even by cutting the small branches, we can get the fruits." 

Page #105:
---------------------------
The fourth chapter of the Karma Granth says, "Why cut the branches? Just pluck the clusters of fruits."
The fifth one said, "What is the use of the clusters? It is better to take only a few fruits from them."
Finally, the sixth man said, "All these thoughts are pointless; because the fruits we want are already lying down below, can't we achieve our purpose from them?"

Another story: Six men were going to loot wealth. On the way, they came across a village, and one of them said, "Destroy this village - kill any human, animal, bird, whoever you find, and loot the wealth."
Hearing this, the second one said, "Kill the animals and birds, but only kill the humans who resist."
The third one said, "Why kill the poor women? Kill the men." The fourth one said, "Not all men, only those who are armed."
The fifth one said, "Why kill even the armed men who don't resist?"
Finally, the sixth man said, "What is the benefit of killing anyone? Take the wealth in a way that it can be stolen, and don't kill anyone. It is not right to loot wealth and kill its owners."

From these two examples, the nature of Leshyas is clearly understood. In each example, the results of the subsequent men are found to be auspicious, more auspicious, and most auspicious compared to the results of the previous men. In the results of the subsequent men, there is a decrease in affliction and an increase in gentleness. The result of the first man should be understood as 'Krishna Leshya', the result of the second as 'Neel Leshya', and so on, the result of the sixth man should be understood as 'Shukla Leshya'. - Necessary Haribhadri Vritti p. 15 and Lok. Pra., S.3, Shloka 363-380.

According to the above three opinions regarding the nature of Leshya-dravya, the existence of Bhava-Leshya should be understood up to the thirteenth Gunasthan. This principle is also accepted in Gommatasar-Jivakand, because it calls Yoga-pravritti as Leshya. As:
"Ayoti chalesamo, suhatiyalessa du desaviravatiye tatti suska lesa, ajogita alessan tu ||531||" 

Page #106:
---------------------------
## Karmagrantha Part Four

In Sarvarthasiddhi and in the transfer of Gommatasara, the tendency of yoga influenced by the rise of kṣaya is called 'leśyā'. Although this statement suggests that leśyā exists only up to the tenth guṇasthāna, it is not contradictory to the previous statement because it is a relative statement. The previous statement only regulates the result that is the cause of the bondage of the nature-region, in the form of leśyā, while this statement expands the result that is the cause of all four bondages, including the state section, etc., in the form of leśyā, not just the result that is the cause of the bondage of the nature-region. For example:

• "The tendency of yoga influenced by the rise of kṣaya, which is the cause of emotion, is called audayiki." Sarvarthasiddhi - Chapter 2, Sutra 6.

"Yoga-patti leśśā, kṣaya udyārañjiyā ho. Tat-to doṣṇaṁ kajje, gandha-cakkra samuddi
486 ||
35
- Jīvakāṇḍa

The consideration of the color, smell, etc. of dravya-leśyā and the consideration of the characteristics, etc. of bhāva-leśyā are in Uttaragadhyāna, B. 34. For this, there is prajñāpanā - leśyāpada, necessary, lokāprakāśa, etc. in the Ākāra Grantha, Śvetāmbara literature. The first example of the two mentioned above is in Jīvakāṇḍa, G. 506-507. To know some special things about leśyā, it is worth seeing the leśyā-mārga-gādhikāra (P. 486-555) of Jīvakāṇḍa.

The indicator or consideration of the impurity and purity of the inner feelings of beings, as it is in Jain scriptures. Something similar to this is the division of six castes in the opinion of Mangali Gosal Putra, which is done on the basis of six colors, like black and blue, based on the purity and impurity of karma. This is described in the "Dīva Nikāya - Sāmaphala-sutta". There are also six jīva-varṇa in the "Mahabharata" 12.286, which are somewhat similar to the above idea.

There is also such an idea in "Pātañjala Yoga Darshan" 4.7; because in it, by dividing karma into four parts, the purity and impurity of the feelings of beings are separated. For this, see the Marathi translation of Doṣa-nikāya, p. 56. 

Page #107:
---------------------------
## Karmagrantha Part Four, Appendix "K"

**Page 10, Line 18**

The term 'Panchendriya' refers to the five types of 'Ekendriya' etc. based on the Dravyendriya, because all sentient beings have five Bhavendriya.

**For example:**

"Ahva pahunch ladidiyam pipanchediya samye ||2666||" -  According to the Visheshavashak, meaning from the perspective of Labdhindriya, all beings are Panchendriya.

"Panchedi vv baulo, maro dhva savya-vis ovalambhao." -  According to the Visheshavashak, G. 2001, meaning due to the ability to know all objects, a person is like a wise Bakul tree, having five senses.

It is true that the Bhavendriya of Dwindriya etc. are progressively more and more distinct from the Bhavendriya of Ekendriya etc. However, there is no doubt that even those who do not have all five Dravyendriya, still possess all five Bhavendriya. This is also confirmed by modern science. Dr. Jagdish Chandra Bose's research has proven the existence of memory in plants. Memory, which is a function of mental power, if found in Ekendriya, then there is no obstacle in the existence of other senses, which are considered to be of a lower order than the mind.

Ancient sages, who were special visionaries, have given much thought to the subject of senses, which is available in many Jain scriptures. Some of it is as follows:

There are two types of senses: (1) Dravyarup and (2) Bhavarup. Dravyendriya, being Pudgala-born, is material; but Bhavendriya is knowledge-based, because it is a synonym for consciousness power.

(1) Dravyendriya is born from the rise of Angopangsha and Nirman Karma. It has two divisions: (a) Nivritti and (b) Upakaran.

(a) The shape of the sense is called 'Nivritti'. Nivritti also has two divisions: (1) Bahir and (2) Abhyantar. (1) The external... 

Page #108:
---------------------------
Karmagrantha Part Four

(1) The external shape is called 'Bahyanivritti' and (2) the internal shape is called 'Abhyantar Nivritti'. The external part is like a sword and the internal part is like the sharp edge of a sword, which is made of extremely pure atoms. This pudgala form of Abhyantar Nivritti is according to the Prajnapana Sutra - Indriyapadaki Tika 026. In Acharangiti Griha 104, its form is described as chetanmaya.

Regarding shape, it should be known that the shape of the skin is of many types, but there is no separation between its external and internal shape. Whatever the external shape of the skin of a creature, so is its internal shape. But this is not the case with other senses: except for the skin, the internal shape of all other senses does not match the external shape. The internal shapes of the same type of senses of all types of creatures are considered to be of one kind. For example: the internal shape of the ear is like a Kadamba flower, the eye is like a lentil seed, the nose is like a flower of Ati Mukta, and the tongue is like a knife. But the external shape is seen to be different in all species. For example: look at the ears, eyes, nose, and tongue of humans, elephants, horses, bulls, cats, rats, etc.

(b) The subject-grasping power of Abhyantar Nivritti is called 'Upakaranendriya'. (2) Bhavaendriya is of two types: - (1) Labdhirupa and (2) Upayogarupa. (1) The ability-speciality of the power of knowing the destruction of Matijnana Avarana is called 'Labdhirupa Bhavaendriya'. (2) According to this Labdhirupa Bhavaendriya, the tendency of the soul to grasp the object is called 'Upayogarupa Bhavaendriya'.

To know this subject in detail, one should see Prajnapana-Pad 15, page 263/ Tattvarth Adhyay 2, Sutra 17-18 and Vritti, Visheshav, Ga 26632003 and Lokaprakash-Sarg 3 Shlok 464 onwards.

Appendix 'G' | On Shambha
Karma Granth Part Four
Page 10 Line 16 "Sanjna"
The meaning of Sanjna is Ayog (mental activity - special). These have two divisions: (a) Knowledge and (b) Experience.
(a) Mati, Shruta, etc. five types of knowledge are 'Jnanasanjna'. (b) Anubhavasanjna (1) Ahar, (2) Bhay, (3) Maithun, (4) Parigraha (5) Krodha (6) Man, (7) Maya (8) Lobha, (9) Ogha, (10) Lok (11) Moh. (12) Dharma, (13) Sukha, (14) Duhkha, (15) Jugupsa and (16) Shoka, these are sixteen divisions. In Acharanga-Niyukti, Ga. 38-39, these sixteen divisions of Anubhavasanjna are made. But in Bhagavati-Shatak 7. Uddeshya and in Prajnapana-Pad, the first ten of these are specified.
These Sanjnartha are found in all beings in varying degrees, therefore these Sanjhi Asanjhi behaviors are not regulatory. In the scriptures, there is a distinction between Sanjhi and Asanjhi, so from one-sense to five-sense beings, the development of consciousness is progressively greater than other Asanjna. To explain this development, the scriptures have divided it into several parts.
(1) In the first division, the very minimal development of knowledge is intended. This development is so minimal that beings with this development are like unconscious, without any activity. This very subtle consciousness is called 'Ogha-Sakha'. One-sense beings have only Ogha-Sakha.
(2) In the second division, the amount of development is intended such that some long-past - not very long-past - is remembered and there is a tendency towards desirable objects and aversion from undesirable objects. This tendency-aversion-causing knowledge is called 'Hetuvaadopaadeshiki Sanjna'. Two-sense, three-sense, four-sense and fully developed five-sense beings have Hetuvaadopaadeshiki Sanjna.
(3) In the third division, the development is intended such that long-past

## Karmagrantha Part Four

**The recollection of subjects experienced in the past and the determination of the present consequences through that recollection is done with the help of a specific mind. This knowledge is called 'Dirghakalopadeśikī Saṁjñā'. Devas, Narakas, Garbhaja humans, and Tiryanchas possess Dirghakalopadeśikī Saṁjñā.**

**(4) In the fourth division, specific Śruta-jñāna is discussed. This knowledge is so pure that it is not possible for any beings other than those who have attained Samyaktva. This pure knowledge is called 'Dṛṣṭivādopadeśikī Saṁjñā'.**

**Wherever the terms 'Saṁjñī' and 'Asaṁjñī' are mentioned in the scriptures, 'Asaṁjñī' refers to beings with Bhoṣa-saṁjñā and Hetuvādopadeśikī Saṁjñā. 'Saṁjñī' refers to beings with Dirghakalopadeśikī Saṁjñā.**

**A detailed discussion of this topic is found in Tattvārtha, Chapter 2, Sutra 25, Vṛtti, Nandī Sutra 36, Viśeṣāvaśyaka Gāthā 504-526, and Lokaprakāśa, Chapter 3, Sloka 442-463.**

**Regarding the usage of 'Saṁjñī' and 'Asaṁjñī', there is a slight difference between the Digambara and Śvetāmbara traditions. The Digambara tradition considers Garbhaja Tiryanchas as both 'Saṁjñī' and 'Asaṁjñī', not just 'Saṁjñī'. Similarly, they consider Saṁmūmi Tiryanchas as both 'Saṁjñī' and 'Asaṁjñī', not just 'Asaṁjñī'. (Jīva, Gāthā 76)**

**It is also noteworthy that the three Saṁjñās mentioned in Śvetāmbara texts, such as Hetuvādopadeśikī, are not found in Digambara scriptures.** 

Page #111:
---------------------------
## Karmagrantha Part Four, Chapter 4: Appendix - On the Word 'Apyaapt' in Verse 11

**(a)** There are two types of 'Apyaapt' - (1) Labdhi-Apyaapt and (2) Karan-Apyaapt. Similarly, **(b)** there are two types of 'Paryaapt' - (1) Labdhi-Paryaapt and (2) Karan-Paryaapt.

**(a)**- A being who, due to the arising of the 'Apyaapt' karma, possesses such strength that they die only after fulfilling their own 'Te'tri's, is called 'Labdhi-Apyaapt'.

**(a)**-2 However, this is not the case with 'Karan-Apyaapt'. Even with the arising of 'Paryaapt' karma, there are 'Karan-Apyaapt' beings. This means that whether the 'Paryaapt' karma arises or the 'Apyaapt' karma arises, as long as the 'Karans' (body, senses, etc., and other 'Paryaaptis') are not exhausted, the being is called 'Karan-Apyaapt'.

**(b)**-1 Those who have the arising of 'Paryaapt' karma and die only after fulfilling their own 'Paryaaptis', not before, are called 'Labdhi-Paryaapt'.

**(b)**-2 This rule does not apply to 'Karan-Paryaapt' beings. Those who are 'Labdhi-Apyaapt' are also 'Karan-Paryaapt'. Because after fulfilling the 'Ahaar-Paryaapti' (food), at least the 'Sharira-Paryaapti' (body) is fulfilled, from then on the being is considered 'Karan-Paryaapt'. It is a rule that even 'Labdhi-Apyaapt' beings do not die without fulfilling at least the three 'Paryaaptis' of food, body, and senses. Regarding this rule, Shri Malayagiriji has written in the commentary on the Nandi Sutra, page 105:

_"Pasmaraagamamvaayudhya Bhriyante Sarvaev Dehinah Tasyaharasharirameey Paryaaptiparyaaptamaamev Vyatiti"_

This means that all beings die only after binding the lifespan of the next birth, they do not die without binding it. The lifespan can only be bound when the three 'Paryaaptis' of food, body, and senses are fulfilled.

Shri Dinayavijayaji has explained this in Lokaprakash Sarg 3, Shlok 1: A being who is 'Labdhi-Apyaapt' also... 

Page #112:
---------------------------
## Karmagrantha Part 12

Completing the **paties** binds the lifespan of the next birth. Having bound the lifespan until the **antmuhurt**, the being then spends the remaining time, considered the **antmuhurt**, in a state of **abaadhakal**. After this, upon death, it can enter the **gatyansar**. A being that does not bind its lifespan and does not complete its **abaadhakal** cannot die.

In Digambara literature, the term **nitt-aparyapt** is used instead of **karan-aparyapt**. The word **hodasa** in this context refers to the body itself. Therefore, until the **sharira-paryapti** is complete, Digambara literature considers the being **nitt-aparyapt**. Once **sharira-paryapti** is complete, it does not allow for the practice of **nitt-aparyapt**. For example:

"**Pajat say udaye, niniapajjati niticho ho ki. Jab shariram ayushna, shivyattim apushnago tatra.**" (Jivakanda, 120)

The essence is that in Digambara literature, the term **nirvriti-aparyapt** refers to a being that has not completed **sharira-paryapti**, even though it has experienced the **udaya** of the **paryapt** karma.

However, in Svetambara literature, the word **karan** refers to the body, senses, and other **paryaptis**. For example:

"**Karanani sharirakshavo ni.**" (Lo Pra, 3, 10)

Therefore, according to the Svetambara tradition, a being that has completed **sharira-paryapti** but not **indriya-paryapti** can still be considered **karan-aparyapt**. This means that completing the **karan** in the form of the body makes one **karan-paryapt**, while not completing the **karan** in the form of the senses makes one **karan-aparyapt**.

Thus, from the Svetambara perspective, a being can be considered **karan-paryapt** as it completes each **paryapti** from **sharira-paryapti** to **manas-paryapti**, and **karan-aparyapt** as it fails to complete subsequent **paryaptis**. However, once a being has completed all the **paryaptis** necessary for **sthayogya**, it can no longer be considered **karan-aparyapt**.

Karma Granth Part Four
The Nature of Paryapti: Paryapti is the power by which a living being takes in the necessary pudgals, such as food, breath, etc., and transforms the taken pudgals into food, etc. Such power becomes the upacshma of pudgals in the living being. That is, just as there is a kind of power in the parts inside the stomach, by which the eaten food is transformed into different forms, in the same way, such power is formed from the pudgals taken by the living being born in the place of birth, which transforms the food, etc., into the forms of khal, rasa, etc. That power is Paryapti. Some of the janak pudgals are taken by the living being born in the place of birth at the very first time, and some are taken later on at every moment, becoming like the previously taken pudgals due to their association.
There are six types of Paryapti according to the division of the body: (1) Ahar, (2) Sharira Paryapti, (3) Indriya Paryapti, (4) Dvama-Malam-S Paryapti, (5) Bhasha Paryapti, and (6) Manah Paryapti. Their explanation should be seen in the meaning of the 46th verse of the Karma Granth, from page 67 onwards.
Out of these six Paryaptis, the first four Paryaptis are possessed by the Ekendriya only. The Dwindriya, Triindriya, Chaturindriya, and Asagni-Panchendriya living beings are the possessors of the remaining five Paryaptis except Manah Paryapti. The Sagni-Panchendriya living beings are the possessors of all six Paryaptis. This subject is in the verse, Shri Jinamatragani Kshamasraman-Kuta Brihatsagrahana:
"Ahar Saridiya-Pajatti Anapana Bhasamanu.
Prasari Pancha Chapi Ya, Egivigivigalasanneenam. || 346 ||" This verse is recorded at number 118 in Gommatasar-Jivakanda. To know the special nature of the present subject, these places are worth seeing:

On the word "krama mavitva" (sequential occurrence)
The use of "krama mavitva" for the liberated soul (kevali) is debatable. There are three main viewpoints:

**(1) The Siddhant viewpoint:** This viewpoint considers both kevalgyan (omniscience) and kevaldarshan (omniscient perception) to be sequential. Supporters of this viewpoint include Shri Jinbhadragani, Kshamasraman, etc.

**(2) The second viewpoint:** This viewpoint considers both kevalgyan and kevaldarshan to be simultaneous. Supporters of this viewpoint include Shri Mallvadi, Tarkik, etc.

**(3) The third viewpoint:** This viewpoint does not differentiate between the two uses, considering them to be one and the same. The founder of this viewpoint is Shri Siddhasen Diwakar.

The main arguments of each viewpoint are presented below:

**1 (a) Siddhant:** (Nagavati Shatak 18 and 25, 6 verses, and Prajnapanapad 30) states that both knowledge and perception are distinct and their sequential occurrence is clearly described. 

**(b) Niyukti:** (A. Ni. Ga. 277-976) clearly states that kevalgyan and kevaldarshan are distinct, with their characteristics being knowledge and perception of all things, and the simultaneous occurrence of both uses is prohibited.

**(c) The twelve numbers of different coverings and uses of kevalgyan and kevaldarshan are described in the scriptures (Prajnapan 26035, etc.).

**(d) Kevalgyan and kevaldarshan are said to be infinite, which refers to their attainment, not their use. In terms of use, their state is for a single moment; because infinity in terms of use is not established in the scriptures.

**(e) The nature of uses is such that they occur sequentially. Therefore, kevalgyan and kevaldarshan should be considered sequential and distinct.

**2 (a) The covering-destruction (kshaya) cause and the general and specific subjects are simultaneous, so kevalgyan and kevaldarshan are simultaneous.

**(b) In layasthik uses, the cause-effect relationship or the mutual dependence can occur. This is not the case in gyayik uses; because the self, which is the nature of knowledge, when free from coverings, both its kshayik uses should be continuous.

**(c) The infinite nature of kevalgyan and kevaldarshan, which is mentioned in the scriptures, can only occur in the simultaneous viewpoint; because in this viewpoint, both uses are simultaneous and continuous. Therefore, from the viewpoint of dravyarthiknaya, the flow of uses can be called infinite.

**(d) Whatever is said in the Siddhant regarding kevalgyan and kevaldarshan, all of it supports their individual distinction, not their oneness. Therefore, both uses should be considered simultaneous. 

Page #115:
---------------------------
## 44
**Karmagrantha Part Four**

**(a)** Just as in a Shan-paryaya, many subjects like Ghat-patadi are perceived when the material is available, similarly, when the material like Avarana-kshaya, Vishaya, etc. is available, only the use, the general and specific nature of the objects can be known. Just as at the time of Kevalgyan, even though there is no Matijnanavaran, etc., Mati, etc. are not considered separate from Kevalgyan, similarly, even though there is a destruction of Kevaldarshanavaran, it is not appropriate to consider Kevaldarshan separate from Kevalgyan.

**(b)** Due to the difference in Vishaya and Kshayopashamat, a difference can be seen between Chanasthikgyan and Darshan, but due to the infinite nature of Vishaya and the similar nature of Kshayik, no difference can be seen between Kevalgyan and Kevaldarshan.

**(c)** If Kevaldarshan is considered separate from Kevalgyan, then it will be considered as having a limited subject matter, as it is only concerned with the general, which will contradict its infinite nature as stated in the scriptures.

**(d)** The speech of time is like a mirage, it is difficult to understand, but the statement of the scriptures, that there is no difference, can be fully understood.

**(e)** The difference in Avarana is relative; that is, even though Avarana is one in reality, it should be understood as different due to the difference in function and title. Therefore, in one use-person, Gyanatva and Dashatva should be considered as two different Dharmas. It is not appropriate to consider use, Gyan-darshan as two different things; therefore, both the words Gyan-darshan are synonymous and have the same meaning.

Upadhyaya Shriyasovijayaji has reconciled all three viewpoints in his Gyanbindu 1114: the viewpoint of the Siddhanta, from the perspective of the pure Shuddha Rijusutra; the viewpoint of Shrimatlavadiji, from the perspective of Vyavahar-maya; and the viewpoint of Shri Siddhasen Diwakar, from the perspective of Sangrahanaya. A detailed description of this subject, with supporting arguments, can be found in Jeevakanth Ma. 3 onwards; Visheshavashyak Many Ga. 3088-3135; Dharmasangrahani Ga. 1336-1356 by Shriharibhadra; Tattvarthatika A. 1, Su. 31, Pa. by Shri Siddhasen; Shrimalayagiri-Nandivritti 10 134-138; and Manbindu 154-164.

In the Digambar Sampradaya, the second viewpoint, that of use-victory, is the most popular:

"Jagavan vadanaan, kevaljaniss basanan cha taha. Vinayarpayasatapam, jah pattai tah muneghavan ||16||" - Niyamsar.

"Siddhanam sidhdagai, kevalnaanam cha bansagan khayian. Samm samanaahar, upayogaanarakam apoutti ||730||" - Jeevakanth.

"Basanpuvam janam, chhadamasthanam na vonni upajagga. Garv samha kevali-nahe jhug tu te dho vi ||44||" - Drashyasangrah. 

Page #116:
---------------------------
## Karmagrantha Part 12, Appendix "Ch"
## "Bhavasumasa" Page 22, "Ekendriya Shabda"

Three uses of Ekendriya (single-sense) have been considered. Therefore, there is a doubt whether it is appropriate to consider the "mati" (mind) use in Ekendriya after the destruction of the "sparshendriya-mati-jnanaavaran" karma (karma that obscures the knowledge of the sense of touch, mind, and knowledge). However, how can the "shruta" (hearing) use be considered in them due to the absence of "mashaalabdhi" (ability to speak) and "shravanalabdhi" (ability to hear)? Because the scriptures consider only those with language and the ability to hear as having knowledge. For example:

"Bhataso - Yaldvino Jujjae M Yassa Haritahi || 9025 ||"

Only those with the ability to speak and hear can be "bhaavabhoot" (have the potential to become a soul). Others cannot. Because "shrutaan" refers to the knowledge that arises in those who desire to speak or hear words.

The solution is that just as the five "maavendriya-janya" (generated by the five senses) knowledge exists in trees and other living beings even in the absence of other "dravya" (external) senses, similarly, the existence of "bhaavashruta" knowledge in Ekendriya is scriptural even in the absence of the ability to speak and hear. For example:

"Jah Sumang Bhavitriya - Naan Vashviviavarohe Vi.
Tah Davyasuyaabhave Bhavasury Pashchivayinam || 103 ||"

Just as there is subtle knowledge generated by the "bhaavendriya" (inner sense) in the absence of "dravya" senses, similarly, there is a small amount of "bhaavashruta" knowledge in earth-bodied beings and others in the absence of external causes like language. It is true that Ekendriya does not have the same clear knowledge as others. The scriptures consider Ekendriya to have a desire for food, which is the reason for considering their knowledge to be unclear. 

Page #117:
---------------------------
Kamgranth Part Four

The desire for food is a specific result (adhyavasaya) of the soul arising from the emergence of shudhavedaniya. As: -
_"Maharasanya aharabhilashah kshudaniyaoshayaprabhava khalvaatmaparinam iti."_
-Aavashyak, Harimatti Vritti p. 580. In this adhyavasaya, which is in the form of desire, there is an alternative of words and meaning like "It would be good if I get such and such thing". The adhyavasaya which is with alternative is called shrutajnana. As:
_"Inshiamanonimittam jam vishnan suyanusarenam. Nipayatyuttisamatham, tam mayasuyamai sesam. ||1001||"_
Visheshaavashyak. That is, the knowledge arising from the senses and mind, which is capable of stating the definite meaning, is 'bhavasch ta' and the knowledge different from it is to be understood as 'matijnana'. If the use of senses is not considered, then how can the desire for food, which is scriptural, occur in them? Therefore, even in the absence of the power to speak and hear, it is necessary to believe in the very subtle use of shruta in them.

The one who has bhapa and shravanalabdhi has bhavashrut, the other does not. The meaning of this scriptural statement is that the one who has the power mentioned above has clear bhavashrut and the others have unclear.

(2) - Marganasthan-Adhikar. The Fundamental Divisions of Marganas.

**"In the body, in the senses, in the vows, in the knowledge of the passions, in restraint, in the shedding of the karmic particles, in the state of being a worthy soul, in right faith, and in the nourishment of the soul, there are fourteen divisions."** (6)

**Explanation:** The divisions of Marganasthan are: motion, senses, body, yoga, Veda, passions, knowledge, restraint, shedding, karmic particles, worthy soul, right faith, right knowledge, and nourishment of the soul. (6)

**The Arrangement of Marganas**

**Meaning:** (1) "Motion" refers to the state of being capable of motion, which arises from the karmic activity of motion, and which leads to the behavior of a human being who is capable of tearing apart.

1. This verse is from the Panchasangraha (Dwar 1, Verse 21). In the Gommatasar Jivakanda, it is as follows:

"In the body, in the senses, in the vows, in the knowledge of the passions, in restraint, in the shedding of the karmic particles, in the state of being a worthy soul, in right faith, and in the nourishment of the soul." (141)

2. In the Marganadhikar of the Gommatasar Jivakanda, the characteristics of Marganas are summarized as follows:

(1) "Motion" refers to the state of being capable of motion, which arises from the karmic activity of motion, and which leads to the behavior of a human being who is capable of tearing apart. (145)

(2) "Senses" refer to the eyes, etc., which are independent of each other, like the gods of the heavens. (163)

(3) "Body" refers to the state of being a living being, which arises from the karmic activity of birth, and which is the constant companion of the karmic activity of birth. (180)

(4) "Yoga" refers to the power that is the cause of the living being's acceptance of karma, which arises from the karmic activity of the body, and which is associated with the mind, speech, and body. (215)

**Four types of paths (gatis) and their sub-categories (vishesh bhed):**

**[From four verses]**

**1.  **Suranara, Tiryancha, Naraka, and Igniyata, these are the four gatis. 
**2.  **Bhujalajalanilanakan, Tasa ya Manakyatanujoga, these are the six kayas.

* **Ekaindriya, Dvindriya, Triindriya, Charindriya, and Panchendriya** are the five indriyas.
* **Prithvikaaya, Jalakaaya, Vayukaaya, Agni kaaya, Vanaspatikaaya, and Usakaaya** are the six kayas.

**(2) The Nature of the Different Indriya-Manas:**

**(1)** The Nis-jati possesses only the touch indriya and is obtained through the arising of the A-indriya-jati-namakarma. This is called 'A-indriya-jati'. 

**(2)** The jati that possesses two indriyas (touch and taste) and is born from the arising of the Dwi-indriya-jati-namakarma is called 'Dwi-indriya-jati'.

**(3)** The jati that possesses three indriyas (touch, taste, and smell) and is obtained through the arising of the Tri-indriya-jati-namakarma is called 'Tri-indriya-jati'.

**(4)** The jati that possesses four indriyas (touch, taste, smell, and sight) and is obtained through the arising of the Chatur-indriya-jati-namakarma is called 'Chatur-indriya-jati'.

**(5)** The Panch-indriya-jati possesses all five indriyas (touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing) and is obtained through the arising of the Panch-indriya-jati-namakarma.

**(3) The Nature of the Different Kaya-Margna:**

**(1)** The earthly body, formed from earth, is called 'Prithvi-kaya'.

**(2)** The watery body, formed from water, is called 'Jal-kaya'.

**(3)** The fiery body, formed from fire, is called 'Tej-kaya'.

**(4)** The airy body, formed from air, is called 'Vay-kaya'.

**(5)** The plant body, formed from plants, is called 'Vanaspati-kaya'.

These five kayas are obtained through the arising of the Sthavar-namakarma and their possessors are the Ek-indriya jivas like Prithvi-kapik, etc.

**(6)** The body that can move and is obtained through the arising of the Prasa-namakarma is called 'Sakaya'. It is possessed by all types of jivas from Dwi-indriya to Panch-indriya.

**(4) The Nature of the Different Yoga-Margna:**

**(1)** The mind's activity is called 'Mano-yoga', which is Avaric, Vaikriya... (See Appendix "J").

## Karma-naap, Part Four

**(2)** This is the accumulation of the **mano-vaky** group, which is taken in by the **maharak-sharira**. 
**(3)** The activity of the **jiva** that is done with the help of **bhaasha-nadhya** that is accumulated by the **oudarik, vaikriya, or aharak-barira** through action is called **vachan yoga**. 
**(1)** The specific activity of the **paary shakti** of the **barira-dhari atma** is called **kay yoga**.

**(11)** The **veda** of a man, woman, and eunuch are **narastrinpusaka**, **kashaya** are **krodh, mad, maya, and lobha**. **Mati, shruta, avadhi, manah paryaya, and keval jnana**, and **mati-ajnana, shruta-ajnana, and vibhang jnana** are the eight **sakar** (specific) uses.

**(Meaning)** (1) The desire for contact with a woman is **purusha-veda**, (2) the desire for contact with a man is **stri-veda**, and (3) the desire for contact with both a man and a woman is **napunsak-veda**.

**(1)** This is the **lakshya-bhaga-veda**. The **dravya-veda** is determined by external signs: the signs of a man are beard, mustache, etc. The signs of a woman are the absence of beard and mustache, and breasts, etc. The eunuch has some signs of both a man and a woman.

The same thing has been said in the **prajnaapana-bhaasha** word team: "**Yoni-m duvam-sparya, mumbhta ko-svata stano. Puska-miteti lingani, sapta sroste prachakshate** (1). **Mehanam kharata baadhay, shoshtiya madhu dhristaata. Stri-kamiti lingani, sapta dhuro prachakshate** (2)."

**Verse 3:**

"Those with breasts and hair like a woman, and with the characteristics of a eunuch, are said by the wise to be fueled by the fire of delusion."

**Regarding the sign of a eunuch, this statement is made from a perspective of abundance. Because sometimes, the signs of a man are seen in a woman, and the signs of a woman are seen in a man. The following examples are worth considering for the truth of this matter:**

"My dear friend, Dr. Shiv Prasad, who was at the Kota Hospital (now you have left your job with the intention of opening an independent clinic, you witnessed this with your own eyes) says that 'during the time of Dr. Makbat Sahib (who was the Chief Medical Officer in Kota at that time) ... a person underwent surgery (operation) for a tumor (under the esophagus). He was anesthetized for the surgery. Upon examination, it was found that his body had both male and female organs. Both these organs were fully developed. After the surgery, he was brought back to consciousness. Upon questioning, he revealed that he had used both organs separately for their respective functions, but due to doubts about pregnancy, he had stopped using the female organ. This person is still alive.'

"It is heard and is often true that 'in the Merwara District, a person had a son. After becoming an adult, he passed the entrance exam. In the same way, his parents arranged his marriage, as there was no doubt about his being a man. But after the marriage, it was found that he was completely unfit for manhood. Therefore, upon further investigation, it was found that this was indeed the case, and he had the signs of a woman..."

**(1)** 'Matijnana' is the knowledge that arises through the senses and mind, and primarily knows present objects. 
**(2)** 'Shrutajnana' is knowledge based on scriptures, where the relationship between words and their meanings is understood. It arises after Matijnana. For example, hearing the word 'jal' (water) and knowing that it refers to water, or seeing water and thinking that it is the meaning of the word 'jal', and considering its relationship to other things.
**(3)** 'Avadhijnana' is knowledge that arises without the help of the senses or mind. It requires only the specific ability of the soul and knows objects that have form.
**(4)** 'Manahparyayajnana' is knowledge that knows the mental states of sentient beings. It requires only the specific destruction of karmas of the soul, not the senses or mind.
**(5)** 'Kevalajnana' is the knowledge that knows all things in time, and is perfect, eternal, and independent.
**(6)** The opposite of the correct use of Matijnana is 'Matiajnana'. For example, believing that a pot, etc., is one and the same, meaning that it is not different from anything else.
**(7)** The opposite of the correct use of Shrutajnana is 'Shrutaajnana'. For example, hearing a word like 'Hari' and concluding that it means 'lion' and that no other meaning is possible.
**(8)** The opposite of the correct use of Avadhijnana is 'Avadhiajnana'. It is said that Shiva had this kind of knowledge because he saw seven islands and seven seas and concluded from that that all islands and seas were the same.

## Karmagrantha Bhaga Nar

When Mithyatva arises, the soul becomes Kavaagrahi, unable to perceive the true nature of any object. At that time, its use, whether it be in the form of Mati, Shruta, or Avadhi, becomes ignorant (Ayatharth-Jan). 

Manahparyaya and Fevalman, these two uses, do not occur with Mithyatva; they are inherently knowledge.

These paths of use are called Saffar because they primarily know the general and specific aspects of an object, especially in terms of time. ||11||

**(8) The nature of the different types of Samyama Margna:**

Meaning: Samayik, Chevopastapamo, Pariharavishukh, Sukshmasamyara, Yathakyarat, Deshaviriti and Aviriti, these seven are the types of Samyama Margna. Chakshudarshan, Achakshurvarshan, Avadhivarshan and Kevalvarshan, these four uses are Anakar. ||12||

**(a)** This is a type of **san̄yama** whose duration is considered to be from the time of **upasthāpana** until the time of taking **bada dīkshā**. This **san̄yama** is observed in the **Airavata kshetra** during the reign of the first and last **tīrthaṅkara**. Those who observe this **san̄yama** have to accept the five **mahāvratas** including **pratikramāṇa**. The **svāmī** of this **san̄yama** is **strītakalpī**.

**(b)** The **samāyika-saṅgama** mentioned here is observed from the time of its acceptance until the end of life. This **san̄yama** is observed in the **Airavata kshetra** during the reign of the middle twenty-two **tīrthaṅkara**. However, in the **Mahāvieha kshetra**, this **saṅgama** is observed by all. Those who observe this **san̄yama** have to observe four **mahāvratas** and their **kalpa** is **sthitā-sthita**.

**(2)** The **prathamasan̄yama** is a **paryāya** which is **upasthāpana** (**vratāropaṇa**) again. This means that the time spent observing the **san̄yama** previously is not counted, and the **vīkshā-kāla** is counted from the time of accepting the **san̄yama** again. The **chhoṭe-baḍe** are observed accordingly. This is a **kshetra-sthānīya san̄yama**. It has two types: **(a) sātivāra** and **(b) nirati-chāra**.

**(a)** **Sātivāra-chhedopasthāpanīya saṅgama** is the **saṅgama** which is accepted again after the **mahāvratas** are broken due to some reason.

Karma is a burden, which is accepted as a great Vibha with the help of Ratvar Samayik Samayam. This Samayam is found in the Sadhus of the first and the supreme Tirthankara in the Bharat-Airavat Kshetra and when a Sadhu of one Tirth enters another Tirth. For example: Keshigalaya etc. of Shri Pashrdhnath are found in Bhagwan Mahavira; then they also have this Samayam in the form of Punksha.
(3) Parihar Vishuddha Sangha is that in which the Tapasya named Parihar Vishuddhi is performed. The Vidhan of Parihar Vishuddhi Tapasya is as follows:
1- This is mentioned in Bhagavati Sutra.
2- To get the right to this Samayam, the minimum age of Grihasth Paryaya is 21 years, the minimum age of Sadhu Paryaya (Vibhakal) is 20 years and the maximum age of both Paryayas is considered to be a few crore years ago. For example:
"Epassa Sa Neo, Gihiriamo Nahani Gantisa. Japariamo Bissa, Vosudhi Unko Sa Suna." The one who is eligible for this Sanvar has the knowledge of 10.5 Purvas. This is mentioned in his Taba by Shri Prayasommuri. It is considered to be accepted from the Tirthankaras or the Antavasi near the Tirth. The Muni who adopts this Samayam can perform Niksha and Vihar in the third Prahar of the day and meditation, Kayotsarg etc. at other times. But there is a slight difference of opinion in the Digambar Shastra in this regard. In it, a person of 30 years of age is considered eligible for this Samayam. 9 Purvas or knowledge is considered necessary for the eligible person. It is forbidden to accept this Samayam from anyone other than the Tirthankara. Also, there is permission to go up to two Kos in any part of the day except for the three Sandhyas. For example:
"Tisan Vaso Ammai, Vasapudhattam Na Tityaya Ramule. Pacharavanam Padhido, Sansun Lugaauy Biharo."

##  Chapter Four of the Vermagranth

A group (community) of nine Sadhus consists of four ascetics, four attendants (servants), and one Vasnaacharye. The ascetics observe fasts during the summer: one minimal, two moderate, and three excellent. During the winter, they observe two minimal, three moderate, and four excellent fasts. However, during the rainy season, they observe one minimal, four moderate, and five excellent fasts. The ascetics observe the Ayambil vow with Abhipraha on the day of Para. This cycle continues for six months. In the next six months, the previous ascetics become attendants, and the attendants become ascetics.

For the next six months, the ascetics who have taken on the role of ascetics follow the same order of austerity as the previous ascetics. However, the Sadhus who have taken on the role of attendants always observe Ayambil. After the next six months, for the third six months, the Vaachnaacharye becomes the ascetic; one of the remaining eight Sadhus becomes the Vaachnaacharye, and the rest become attendants. In this way, after the completion of these third six months, this twelve-month austerity called "Pariharavishuddha" ends. After this, they either accept the Jinakalp or return to the same Gachch they were previously in, or they begin austerity again. The "Nivishmanak" and "Nivishtakaiyik" are the two types of Pariharavishuddha austerity. The current Pariharavishuddha is called "Nivishmanak," and the past Pariharavishuddha is called "Nivishtakaiyik."

## Translation:

**Karmagranth Chapter 4**

**Subtle Samparaya Samyama**

(1) **Subtle Samparaya Samyama** is a state where **Lomashaya** arises, but other **Kshayas** do not. This Samyama is attained by those who are in the **Basava Gunasthan**. It has two types: (a) **Sanklishyamana** and (b) **Vishuddhyamana**.

(a) **Sanklishyamana Subtle Samparaya Samyama** is attained by those who fall from **Upshamni** at the time of attaining the **tenth Gunasthan**. This is because, due to the fall, the **Parinam** at that time are **Sanskesha-praman**.

(b) **Vishuddhyamana Subtle Samparaya Samyama** is attained by those who ascend to **Upshamni** or **Kshapakni** in the **Basava Gunasthan**. This is because the **Parinam** at that time are **Vishuddhi-praman**.

**Yathalyat Samyama**

(2) **Yathalyat Samyama** is a state where there is no **Kshaya** arising, not even a trace. It has two types: (a) **Chhanasthik** and (b) **Bayasthik**.

(a) **Chhanasthik Yathalyat Samyama** is attained by those who are in the **eleventh** and **twelfth Gunasthan**. The difference between the eleventh and twelfth Gunasthan is that in the eleventh, **Kshaya** does not arise, but its **existence** remains. However, in the twelfth, **Kshaya** does not even exist.

(b) **Bayasthik Yathalyat Samyama** is attained by **Kevalis**. The **Samyama** of a **Sayogi Kevali** is called **Sayogi Yathalyat**, and the **Samyama** of an **Aayogi Kevali** is called **Aayogi Yathalyat**.

**Deshavirati Samyama**

(3) **Deshavirati Samyama** is the state of being free from **Karmabandha-janak** and **Aarambha-samarambha** to some extent. **Grihasthas** are eligible for this **Samyama**.

**The extent of Shravaka's compassion:**

(4) **Munis** are free from all kinds of violence, therefore their compassion is considered **complete**. However, **Grihasthas** cannot remain completely free from violence, therefore their compassion is... 

Page #133:

##  **Verma Granth Part Four**

**(7)** Not accepting any kind of restraint is called 'Avirati'. It is found in the first four Ganasthanas. 

**(8)** The four types of Darshanamangana:

**(1)** The fault that arises from the three Naras is called 'Paksha Darshan'.

**(2)** The fault that arises from the senses other than the Paksha and from the mind is called 'Anardashan'.

**- -** The quantity is said to be very gradual. If the compassion of the monks is considered to be twenty Biswas, then the compassion of the Shravakas should be considered to be one and a quarter Biswas. This is what is said in the Jain scriptures: "The compassion of the Sadhus is twenty Biswas and the compassion of the Shravakas is one and a quarter Biswas." The reason for this is that Shravakas can only give up the violence of living beings, not the violence of stationary beings. Therefore, the compassion of the monks is half the quantity compared to the twenty Biswas. Even in this, Shravakas can give up intentional violence, but not the violence that arises from the beginning. Therefore, even from that half quantity, half is taken away, leaving five Biswas of compassion. Intentional violence can only be given up by those who are innocent. Shravakas are not free from the violence of the Sadhus, so they have one and a quarter Biswas of compassion. Even from this, half is taken away. Because even the violence of the innocent is done by the Shravakas, they do not do it intentionally. Therefore, the quantity of the Shravakas' compassion is considered to be one and a quarter Biswas.

To understand this concept, here is an ancient story:

"Joba Suhma Chula, ... Aranbha Bhave Duniha.
Savaraha Niravaraha, Savikkha Va Niravishkha."

For a detailed explanation of this, see Jainatarvadarshana, Chapter 18.

**(1)** Although four types of Darshan are known everywhere, and Manah Paryaya Darshan is not considered one of them, in some places, Manah Paryaya Darshan is also accepted. This is mentioned in the commentary of Tattvarth-a.s. 24:

"Kechittu Manyante Prajnapanam Mam: Paryayanaane Varshanana Padayas."

## Karmagrantha Part Four

(3) For those who have overcome the five senses, the knowledge of the general nature of the objects of perception, without the aid of the senses, is called 'Avadhi Darshan'.

(4) The knowledge that perceives all the objects of perception in their general form is called 'Keval Darshan'.

Darshan is called 'Aakar-Upayog' because it primarily knows the general form (general shape) of the object, from its general and specific forms. In Nyaya-Shevik and other Darshanas, 'Aakar-Upayog' is called 'Nirvikalpahavyavsayatmakgyan'. ||12||

(10) The nature of the six Leshyas:

A dark blue crow, then a white one, these are the two types of 'Bhanayamargna'. ||13||

Black, blue, pigeon, bright, lotus, and white, these are the six Leshyas. 'Bhashyatva' and 'Abhayatva' are the two types of 'Bhanayamargna'. 'Vevak' (Sayopashmik), 'Kshayik', 'Aupashbhik', 'Mithyatva', 'Mith', and 'Sasavan', these are the six types of 'Samya Parvamargna'. 'Sanshitva' and 'Asanshitva' are the two types of 'Panni Margna'. ||16||

**Meaning:**

(1) Due to the connection of the soul with the black-colored Leshya-Aatiy Pudgals, similar to kajal, such a result occurs in the soul, which leads to the inclination towards the five Ashtrayas (Hisaar, etc.). The mind, speech, and body do not remain under control; the nature becomes petty. The tendency to act without examining the merits and demerits arises, and cruelty becomes dominant. This result is called 'Krishna Leshya'. 

Page #135:
---------------------------
## Karmagrantha - Part Four

**(2)**  A result arises in the soul from the **leshya** of a dark blue color, similar to that of clouds, which causes envy, intolerance, and delusion. The soul becomes entangled in Maya (illusion), and a desire for worldly pleasures arises. This result is called **Nila-leshya**.

**(3)** A result arises in the soul from the **leshya** of a blood-red color, similar to that of a pigeon's neck, which causes crookedness in speech, action, and thought. There is no simplicity in any matter, atheism arises, and there is a tendency to speak in a way that causes suffering to others. This result is called **Kapot-leshya**.

**(4)** A result arises in the soul from the **leshya** of a red color, similar to that of a parrot's beak, which causes a sense of pride, a loss of humility, and a tendency to be fickle. There is an interest in religion and a desire to benefit all beings. This result is called **Tejo-leshya**.

**(5)** A result arises in the soul from the **leshya** of a yellow color, similar to that of turmeric, which causes a decrease in the passions of anger, pride, etc. There is a sense of peace, self-control, and restraint of the senses. One can practice self-discipline, speak moderately, and engage in virtuous activities. This result is called **Pap-leshya**.

**(6)** The result called **Shukla-leshya** is characterized by a cessation of attachment to worldly objects and a focus on religion and spiritual practices. There is no hindrance in regulating the mind, speech, and body. The passions are subdued, and there is a tendency to develop detachment.

**The Coolness Becomes:** This result occurs in relation to the straw-like beings of the white color, like a conch shell.

**(11) The Nature of the Divisions of Bhavyatva:**

**(1)** Those who attain liberation or are capable of attaining liberation due to the a-nadi (beginningless) Taarash-Pariṇāmik-Mār (path of liberation) are called **'Bhasm'**.

**(2)** Those who are not capable of attaining liberation at any time due to the a-nadi (beginningless) and various Pariṇāma (transformations) are called **'Abhashya'**.

**(12) The Nature of the Divisions of Samyaktvamargna:**

**(1)** The **'Aupakshamik Samyaktv'** is the self-transformation in the form of **'Tattva-Ruchi'** (interest in truth) that manifests from the cessation of the four Ananta-Anubandhokapāya (four infinite attachments) and Darshan-Mohaniya (obscurations of perception). It has two divisions: **(a) 'Granthi-Bhed-Janaya'** and **(b) 'Upsham-Shreni-Madhi'**.

**(a) 'Granthi-Bhed-Janaya Aupakshamik Samyaktv'** occurs in those who have a-nadi (beginningless) Mithya-Drishti (false belief). The process of its attainment is discussed in the second...

**1.** There are many Bhavyas (liberation-worthy beings) who, despite being capable of liberation, do not attain it because they do not find the suitable material for attaining liberation. Therefore, they are called **'Jati-Madhya'**. There is also soil that contains particles of gold, but due to the lack of suitable means, it has not manifested yet and is unlikely to manifest in the future. However, based on its potential, we can call it **'Suvarna-Mrittika'** (golden soil). Similarly, it is not contradictory to call those beings who are capable of liberation but cannot attain it due to the lack of specific means, **'Jati-Bhavy'**. This is discussed in the commentary of the 18th chapter of Prajñāpanā, in the Visheshshataka by Upadhyaya-Samayasundaragani, and in the 'Jayanti' section of the 1st Shataka of Bhagavati.

**2.** See Appendix 'Sh'.

## Firm Granth Part Four

This is written in the tradition of the Karma Granth. It is also called 'Prathabhopama Sampāv'.

**(b)** 'Upshamni-Mashi Aupchamik Samyam-Sva' can be attained in the fifth, sixth, or seventh Gunasthan. But in the eighth Gunasthan, it is definitely attained.

At the time of Upshamik Samyak-Tva, Ayubandh, Marg, Ananta-Anubandhi Kshaya's bandh, and Ananta-Anubandhi Kshaya's Uvay, do not take hold. But after being deviated from it, at the time of Sasvav-Bhav, these four things can happen.

**(2)** The element-like result that manifests from the destruction of Ananta-Anubandhi and Darshan-Mohaniya, is called 'Kshayopa-mik Samyak-Tva'.

**(3)** The element-like result that manifests from the destruction of Ananta-Anubandhi-Chatuk and Darshan-Mohaniya-Nik, is called 'Mayik Samyak-Tva'.

This Kshayik Samyak-Tva happens to Jin-Kalik humans. Those beings who attain it after binding, attain Moksha in the third or fourth Bhav. But those who attain this Samyak-Tva before binding the next Bhav's Aapu, they attain liberation in the present Bhav.

**1** This is a common belief for both Shwetamber and Digamber.

**-Sandhisar.**

Karmagrantha Part Four
(4) The result of the soul when it abandons the Aupashmik Samvat and faces Mithyatva is called 'Sas Danasampad'. Its state ranges from the most inferior, lasting for a single moment, to the most superior, lasting for many lifetimes. During this time, the soul's results are not pure due to the arising of Anantar Nubandik Vayas. In Sarasavan, the interest in the self is latent, while in Mithyatva, it is manifest. This is the difference between the two states.
(5) The mixed result of both Tatva and Atatva, which arises from the arising of Samyang Mithya Mohaniya Karma, is called 'Misamyarshva (Samyangma)'.
(6) Mithyatva is the result that arises from the arising of Mithya Mohaniya Karma. Due to this, the soul cannot distinguish between the animate and inanimate, and cannot turn towards the self. Kapri and other defects are its fruits.
[13] - The nature of the divisions of Sanjimaganna:
(1) 'Sanjib' is the specific mental power, i.e., the long-lasting consciousness.
(2) 'Asanjitva' is the absence of the said consciousness. ||13||
67
(1) - Although all beings have some form of consciousness, because without it, the soul itself is impossible, the distinction between Sanji and Asanji that is made in the scriptures is based on long-lasting consciousness. For this, see Appendix 'G'.

[From five verses] Ahayara Bheya, Saranargyavibhagmahasuohiduge.
Sammasatige Pamha, Sukkasannisu Sanni Durga. ||14|| Ahareteri Bhedassuranaraka Vibhangamatishrutvadhidhike. Samyaktvatrike Paklasanjnighu Sanjidwikam. ||14||

**Meaning:** The path of Ahar Karma has two categories: Aharak and Anaharak. In the paths of Vevati and Narakati, there are two types of knowledge: Vibhangajnan, Matijnan, Shrutajnan, Avadhijnan, and Avadhivashen. There are also three types of Samyaktva (Oopashambhik, Shayak, and Kshayopaashambhik), and two Leshyas (Padma and Shulka and Sanshiv). In these thirteen Marganas, there are two types of Sanjho: Apariyapt Sanjho and Pariyapt Sanjho. These are the living beings in these paths. ||14||

(14) The nature of the differences in the Ahar Karma Margana: - Meaning - 1) The living being who takes in any kind of external substance, such as Oja, Lom, and Keval, is called 'Aharak'.
(2) The living being who does not take in any kind of food from the above three types of food is called 'Anaharak'.

Any living being present in the paths of Vagati and Narakati is not Asanjo. Whether it is Apariyapt or Pariyapt, all are Sanjo. This is why these two paths are considered to be the living beings.

The ability to obtain Vimnajnan is not present in any Bhansanji. Even in them, Apariyapt-Pariyapt Sanjho are considered to be the living beings.

1- This topic is discussed in Panchasangrah Gatha 22 to 27. 2- Although Panchasangrah Dwaar Gatha 27th mentions that in Vibhangashan, Sanji - Pariyapt is the only living being, 

Page #140:

## Karmagrantha Part Four, Chapter 66

**Matigyan, Shrutigian, Avadhi-shtik, and Aupashmik, along with the three Samyak-sth and Padma-Shulk-Peshya, these nine Margnaas are considered to have two Jeevasthanas in the Aparaapt (imperfect) state.**

This is because, in an Asanto (non-sentient being), Samyak-tva (perfect conduct) is not possible. And without Samyak-tva, the existence of Matigyan, Shrutigian, etc. is impossible. Therefore, except for Sanjnis (sentient beings), Padma or Shulk Leshya (types of karma) do not have any effect in other beings.

**Matigyan, Shrutigian, and Avadhi-shtik are considered in the Aparaapt state because some beings are born with these three types of knowledge.**

A being who attains Kshayik-Samyak-tva (perfect conduct leading to liberation) after binding their Ayus (life span) can be reborn in any of the four Gatis (states of existence) according to their bound Ayus. This is why Kshayik-Samyak-tva is considered in the Aparaapt state.

**Kshayopa-samyak-tva is considered in this state because future Tirthankaras and others, when they are born as humans after leaving the Deva (divine) and other Gatis, possess Kshayopa-samyak-tva.**

**Regarding Aupashmik-Samyak-tva, it should be understood that when an Aupashmik-Samyak-tva being completes their Ayus, they attain the eleventh Gunasthan (stage of spiritual progress).**

However, this does not contradict this Karmagrantha. Because in the original Pancha-Sangraha (five collections), only one Jeevasthan is mentioned in Vibhang-gyan (knowledge of differentiation). This is based on a specific perspective.

Therefore, from another perspective, two Jeevasthanas are also considered in Vibhang-gyan. This has been clarified in the commentary of the 27th verse of the Shramalaya-giri-murin.

It is written that Tri-bhang-gyan (three-fold knowledge of differentiation) does not arise in Sanjnis with five senses, Tiryanchas (animals), and humans in the Aparaapt state. And those Asanjnis (non-sentient beings) who die and are reborn as Narakas (hell beings) in the Ratna-Prabha Narak (hell), also do not have Vibhang-gyan in the Aparaapt state.

From this perspective, one Jeevasthan is mentioned in Vibhang-gyan, which is the Sanjni (sentient being). However, from a general perspective, two Jeevasthanas should be understood. Because those Sanjnis who die and are reborn as Devas (divine beings) have Vibhang-gyan even in the Aparaapt state. 

Page #141:
---------------------------
## Karmagrantha Part Four

When a being is born in the Avyavahit (uninterrupted) state of existence, it is found in the Mareecured state of being.

**Note:** This meaning should be understood according to the Churni and Pad Sangrah of the Karmagrantha called "Sapta Tika". The Churni states that there are two types of Samyaktv (right conduct) in the Naraka (hell) during the Avyavahit state: Kshayopa-samik and Kshayik. However, in the Deva (heaven) there are three types of Samyaktv, including Aupa-samik. The Pancha Sangrah also confirms this view in its first chapter, verse 25, and its commentary. Gommatasar also supports this view, as it considers the second type of Samyaktv, which is the Upa-samik, to be present in beings in the Avyavahit state. For this, see the Jeevakanda, verse 7266.

However, some Acharyas (teachers) believe that "Aupa-samik does not exist in the Avyavahit state. Only the Paryaya Sanjeeva (transmigrating) state of existence should be considered in this state." In support of this view, they argue that "since there is no Yogya (pure) Adhyavasaya (determination) in the Avyavahit state, Aupa-samik Samyaktv cannot be newly generated, and it is not scripturally acceptable for it to remain in the Avyavahit state. This is because Aupa-samik Samyaktv is of two types. One is that which occurs for the first time in an Anadi Mithyatvi (eternally false believer). The second is that which occurs during the Upa-samik Shreni (stage). In the first type of Samyaktv, the being does not die. Its proof is found in the Agam (scripture) as follows:

"Jhanghosh-ya mag, bandham kal-am cha sasani kunai || Uha-mik-kam pi no kunai ||"
Upa-sam-sam hitto,

Meaning: "The infinite attachment, the bondage, its arising, the bondage of life, and death, these four actions occur in the second Gunasthan (state of being), but none of these actions occur in Aupa-samik Samyaktv."

Regarding the second type of Aupa-samik Samyaktv, the rule is that the current being dies, but as soon as it takes birth, the Samyaktv-mohaniya (obscuring of right conduct) arises, and it ceases to be an Aupa-samik Samyaktv and becomes a Kshayopa-samik. This is written in the Shatak (fifth Karmagrantha) in the Brihat Churni. 

Page #142:
---------------------------
## Karmagrantha Part Four

In the Sanjnimaganna, except for the two Sanji Jeevasthanas, no other Jeevasthan is possible, because all other Jeevasthanas are Asanti. In the above-mentioned Magangas, like Devagati, etc., the meaning of "A-paryapt" is "Kar-paryapt" and not "Ap" (meaning "not"). The reason for this is that in Devagati and Narakagati, no being is found with "A-paryapt" Labdhi. And "A-paryapt" Labdhi means Mati (intellect), Padma (Leshya), and Samyaktva (right faith). || 14 ||

"Those who are Samsanni-ap-aj-aj-urga, they are not born in the Narakagati. Those who are Asanni, they suffer in the four births of the Padma." || 15 ||

"Those who are Tavasangya-paryapt, they are born in the Narakagati. Those who are Paryapt, they are born in the Tejas. The Sthavar (immobile) are Ekendirya (one-sensed), the Pathmanis are Chatvari (four), and the Dwadash-manj-ini are Vikale (defective)." || 15 ||

"Those who are Upsham-samyag-drishti, and die in the Upsham-shreni, they are brought to the Udayavalika by the Samyaktva-mohaniya-puj-ka at the time of their death, and they are given the Veda. Because of this, they cannot attain Upshamik-samyaktva in the A-paryapt state."

Thus, since Upshamik-samyaktva is not possible in the A-paryapt state, according to the opinion of those Aacharyas, only the Paryapt Sanji Jeevasthan is considered to be Samyaktva.

In this context, Shri Jeevavijayji, without mentioning the name of his book in his Taba, has quoted its gatha and written that Upshamik-samyaktva falls from the eleven Gunasthans, but does not die in them. The one who dies is Shramik-samyaktva. The gatha is as follows:

"Those who die in the Upsham-gunas, they are the seventy-seven Lavasattama Devas, they are all Juas."

## Karmagrantha Part Four

**Meaning:** In the human realm, the aforementioned two types of sanji (insufficient and sufficient) and the asanji are present. In the Golaya, there are three types of jeevathanas: insufficient, sufficient, and sanji-dvik. In the five sthavar and ekaindriya, the first four (insufficient subtle, sufficient subtle, insufficient coarse, and sufficient coarse) are jeevathanas. In the asankhya margana, the first twelve jeevathanas are present, excluding the sanji-dvik. In the vikendriya, there are two jeevathanas each, one insufficient and one sufficient. ||15||

**Meaning:** There are two types of humans: garbhaj and sammuchhim. All garbhaj are sanji, and they are found in both insufficient and sufficient forms. However, sammuchhim humans, who are born in the two and a half lop-samudra from the excreta, semen, and blood of garbhaj humans, have a very short lifespan. They die before fulfilling their appropriate sufficient karma, hence they are considered larish-apampt and asanji. Therefore, only the aforementioned three jeevathanas are found in the general human realm.

This means that those who die in the eleventh gunasthan after attaining the upshamshreni are considered to be in the sarvarth-siddh-vimana, with the quality of shaminamya-akta, and are called "lavasapt-dev." They are called lavasapt-dev because their lifespan is seven lavas less, which forces them to take birth as a dev. If their lifespan was longer, they would have attained moksha in this very birth without becoming a dev.

**1:** For example, Bhagwan Shyamacharya describes in Prabhagana, page 5: "How does a sammuchhim human die, oh Muni? Golaya! In the end, in the human realm, in the 50,000 yojanas, in the days, in the 13 karma-bhumis, in the 36 akarma-bhumis, in the 64 sarva-bhovas, in the human realm, in the high places, in the low places, in the games, in the anger, in the bile, in the white, in the red, in the white-red mixture, in the various bodies, in the sexual intercourse, in the city, in the destruction, in the good, in the bad, in the desires, the sammuchhim human dies. He is ignorant, unaware, and full of desires. He is unable to understand the truth. He spends his time in the end, in the last moments."

## Karmagrantha Chapter

The **Tejo-leshya** is found in both **Paryapta** and **Aparyapta** types of **Sanshis** and is also found in the **Aparyapta** state in **Bavar-ekendriya**. This is why the above three **Jovasthanas** are considered in that **Leshya**. **Bavar-ekendriya** is considered **Tejo-leshya** in the **Aparyapta** state. Therefore, from this perspective, **Bhavanpati**, **Vyantar**, etc. Devas, in whom **Tejo-leshya** is possible, when they die with **Tejo-leshya** and take birth in earth, water or vegetation, they have **Tejo-leshya** for some time in the **Aryal** (**Karan-Apayati**) state.

Except for the first four **Jovasthanas**, there is no **Ekendriya** or **Sthavar-kadik** being in any other **Jivasthan**. Therefore, **Ekendriya** and five **Sthavar-kaya** are considered the first four **Jivasthanas** in these six **Marganas**.

The essence of this is as follows: - "When asked, Bhagwan Mahavir, Ganadhar and Gautam say that within the human realm of forty-five lakh yojanas, in the two and a half islands and seas, there are fifteen **Karmabhumis**, thirty **Akarmabhumis** and fifty-six **Antadvipas**, where **Garbhaja** humans are born in the excreta, urine, phlegm, etc. of all impure substances, whose body size is equal to the countless parts of an inch, who are **Asangati**, **Mithyatvi** and **Agnani**, and who are **Aparyapta** and die within a moment.

1. "**Kivha nila kau, seule sa ya bhavanvantariya | Noiss sohammisa-na teuse sa muneyasva. 163||**"
**Brihatsangrahani** | Meaning: There are four accounts like Krishna in **Bhavanpati** and **Vyantar**, but in **Jyotish** and **Sodharma** **Isan** **Devaloka**, there is only **Tejo-leshya**. 2. "**Pudhavi auvanassaha, game pajjal sanchaye. Samanusana daso, sesa parisehiya thana.**"

## Karmagrantha Part Four

Two of the living beings' states are called "Jiva Sthanas". Therefore, in the "Sanjnimagana", twelve Jiva Sthanas should be understood.

74
In each "Vikalendriya", there are two Jiva Sthanas: "Aparyapt" (inadequate) and "Paryapt" (sufficient). Therefore, in the "Vikalendriyamargna", only two Jiva Sthanas are considered. ||15||

Ten "Charam" (extreme) are "Ajaya" (unconquerable), "Haragati" (destructive path), "Ritanuk" (minute particle), "Say" (with), "Anaane" (without), "Padhamatile" (learned), "Sabhavier" (natural), "Achakkhunpumi" (blind), "Ichchi" (desire), "Sathye" (truth), "Vi" (and). ||16|| Ten "Charam" are "Trasayataharak" (eating with fear), "Tiryaktannu" (animal body), "Kashayadvyajnaane" (ignorance of passions), "Pratham" (first), "Trileshya" (three-fold), "Bhavye" (worthy), "Tara" (other), "Achakshu" (blind), "Nishu" (in), "Mithyatve" (false belief), "Sarvani" (all), "Api" (also). ||16||

**Meaning:** In "Sakaya" (body), the final Jiva Sthan is "Avirati" (restlessness), "Aharak" (eating), "Tiryanchgati" (animal path), "Kayayog" (body-yoga), "Char" (four), "Kavay" (passions), "Mati" (understanding), "Shruta" (scripture), "Agnan" (ignorance), "Krishna" (black), etc. The first three "Leshya" (shades), "Madhyashva" (middle horse), "Amadhyastha" (not in the middle), "Achakshurdarshan" (blind vision), "Napumsak" (impotent), "Ved" (knowledge), and "Mithyarathan" (false path) are found in "Bhatu" (earth) and "Paani" (water) states. ||16||

**Meaning:** Out of fourteen, "Aparyapt" and "Paryapt" "Sukshma" (subtle) "Ekendriya" (one-sense) and "Aparyapt" and "Paryapt" "Bavar" (gross) "Ekendriya" (one-sense) are not included in this. The remaining ten Jiva Sthanas are in "Trasafay" (fearful state). Because only in these states does the "Asanama Karma" (non-destructive karma) arise, and therefore they can move freely.

"Avirati" etc., all the Jiva Sthanas mentioned above are considered in the eighteen "Margna" (paths) because these "Margna" are possible in all types of beings.

"Mithyatve" (false belief) is said to be in all Jiva Sthanas. This means that "Mithyatve" is generally found in all Jiva Sthanas. However, in the first twelve Jiva Sthanas, "Bana Bhog" (enjoyment of the body) "Mithyatve" should be understood. Because in them, there is "Ama Bhog" (non-enjoyment) generated "Agnan" (ignorance) and "Jamp" (attachment) "Atatva" (untruth) "Ruchi" (taste). In "Panchasangrah", "Anbhigrahik Mithyatve" (non-grasping false belief) is mentioned. See, Appendix "T".

## Karmagrantha Part Four

It is written in those Jiva-sthānas that they are not accepted as wave-guru-dharma, therefore, due to their false nature, those Jiva-sthānas can also be called 'anamiprihik'. ||16||

**Only the Kevala-trika (Kevala-jnana - Kevala-darshan), the five Samyamas (Samayika, etc.), the Manah-paryaya-jnana, the Vaishvi-virati, the Manoyoga, and the Misamyaktva, these eleven Marg-naas, only the Paryapta-sanjnee Jiva-sthana is present.** In the Vachan-yoga, the last five (Dee-priya, Yondriya, Chaturi-priya, Asanti-panchendriya, and [San-patra]) are Paryapta Jiva-sthānas. In the Chakshu-darshan, the Paryapta three (Chaturindriya, Asanshi-panchendriya, and Sonj-panchendriya) Jiva-sthānas, according to other opinions, are both Paryapta and Aparyapta. Thus, there are six Jiva-sthānas in total. ||17||

**Meaning:** Only the Paryapta-sanjnee Jiva-sthana is considered in the above-mentioned eleven Marg-naas, including the Kevala-trika. The reason for this is that, except for the Paryapta-sanjnee, other types of Jivas cannot have either Sarva-virati or Vaishvi-virati. Therefore, in Jivas other than the Sanjnee, Kevala-trika, five Samyamas, Desha-virati, and Manah-paryaya-jnana, which are related to Virati, cannot exist. In this way, except for the Paryapta-sanjnee, other Jivas do not have a connection with Tathavishadravya-mana, therefore, Manoyoga does not occur, and Misamyaktva also does not have the qualification.

**In Ekendriya, there is no Bhasha-paryapti. Without Bhasha-paryapti, Yoga is not possible. In the Avik Jivas, Bhasha-paryapti is possible. When they complete all their eligible Paryaptis, then Bhasha-paryapti can occur in them, leading to Vachan-yoga.** 

Page #147:
---------------------------
In the fourth part of the Kamgranth, Vachan Yoga, the five types of departures, including Paryapt Vindiya, are considered. 

Only those with eye organs can experience visual perception. There are three types of beings: Chaturindriya, Asanshipanchaindriya, and Sanshipanchaindriya. All three types have eyes. Therefore, other types of beings lack visual perception. 

There are different opinions regarding the three types of beings mentioned above. 

**Two interpretations of Indriyaparyapti are the root of these opinions:**

**(a)** "Indriyaparyapti is the power of the Jiva that transforms the suitable Puggala, derived from the food-like substances, into the form of Indriya."

This interpretation is found in the Prajnapanavritti and Panchasangrahvritti, page 6. According to this interpretation, Indriyaparyapti refers to the power that generates the Indriya. Those who accept this interpretation believe that after the suitable Pantiyas are fully formed (in the Paryapt state), all beings experience Indriya-generated use, not in the Aparyapt state. Therefore, even after becoming Paryapt, Chaturindriya, etc., are not considered to have visual perception in the Aparyapt state.

**(b)** "Indriyaparyapti is the power of the Jiva that transforms the suitable food-like substances into the form of Indriya, thereby gaining the ability to experience Indriya-generated perception."

This interpretation is found in the Vatsasangrahani, page 130, and the Bhagavati-Vritti, page 566. According to this interpretation, Indriyaparyapti refers to the power that performs all actions from the creation of the Indriya to its use. Those who accept this interpretation believe that even in the Aparyapt state, all beings experience Indriya-generated use after becoming Paryapt. Therefore, after becoming Paryapt, due to the use of the eye organ, Chaturindriya, etc., should be considered to have visual perception even in the Aparyapt state. This opinion is supported by the statement mentioned on page 5 of the Panchasangrah-Malayagiri-Vritti:

According to the first view, **Chakshus Darshan** is considered to be attained only after the **Swayogya Paryaptas** are fully developed. According to the second view, **Chakshus Darshan** is considered to be attained even before the **Swabhogya Paryaptas** are fully developed, in the state of **A-Paryaps**. However, for this, the complete development of **Indriya Paryaps** is essential. Because without the development of **Indriya Paryaps**, **Chakshus Darshan** cannot be attained due to the non-development of **Anta** in all. According to this second view, there are six **Jiva Sthanas** in **Chakshus Darshan**, and according to the first view, there are three **Jiva Sthanas**. || 17 ||

**Thoner Pani Di Charma, Cha U Anahare D Sani Ch Apjja.**
**Te Suham Apjja Vina, Sasani Itto Gunne Buchcham.** || 18 ||

**Stri Nar Panch Indriye Charmani, Chatvary Anaharake Dvau Sanjhano Pad Paryapta.**
**Te Sukshma A-Paryapta Bina, Sasadan Ito Gunan Vakyse.** || 18 ||

_Meaning - In **Stri Ved**, **Purush Ved** and **Panch Indriya Jati**, the last four (**A-Paryapt** and **Paryapt Asanji Panch Indriya**, **A-Paryapt** and **Paryapt Sanji Panch Indriya**) are **Jiva Sthanas**. In **Anaharak Margna**, there are two **Sanji** and **Sukshma Ek Indriya**, **Badar Ek Indriya**, **Vi Indriya**, **Shrotriya**, **Chatur Indriya** and **Asanji Panch Indriya**, these six **A-Paryapt**, **Pura Shah Jiva Sthanas**. In **Sasavan Samyaktva**, there are seven **Jiva Sthanas** excluding **Sukshma A-Paryapt** from the above eight.
Now, the **Gun Sthanas** will be discussed. || 18 ||

**Bhavarth -** In the above mentioned three **Margnaas**, **Stri Ved** etc., **A-Paryapt**

"**Karan A-Paryapt** in **Chatur Indriya** and **Vish Indriya Paryapti** are also attained in **Chakshus Darshan**."

The mention of both these interpretations of **Indriya Paryapti** is in **Lok Pra. Sa. 3 Shlok 20-21**.

Asanshi-Panchendriya etc. four living beings are mentioned. Here, the meaning of insufficient is from the cause being insufficient, not from the obtained being insufficient; because - the sufficient is only the Dhyadev, the neuter.
78
Asanshi Panchendriya is considered here as two beings, female and male, and in the principle, neuter; however, there is no contradiction in this. The statement here is from the perspective of the Bhava Veda. The contradiction is from the perspective of the Dravya Veda and the principle. Those who have the Bhava Neuter Veda are either female or male.
There are no signs of a male in the Anahara Maggana. In the eight living beings mentioned above, seven are insufficient and one is sufficient. All types of insufficient beings, Anahara, are at that time when they do not take food for one, two or three times in the Vigraha Gati (Vakra Gati). The sufficient Sanshi is considered Anahara in this regard because the Kevalgyani, in relation to the Madhya Mana, are called Sanjni and they do not take any kind of food because they are Karman Kayayogi in the third, fourth and fifth times of the Kevali Samudhata.
1) "O Bhati, is Asanshi Panchendriya, a Tirthankara, a male, a female or a neuter? Goma! It is not a male or a female, it is a neuter." - Bhagavati
2) "Vasanjni Paryapt is a neuter, but it is considered to be a female because it has the form of a female."

Karma Ranth Part Four

In the Saasaabamasampapashva, seven types of Jivas are mentioned, out of which six are Apariapt and one is Pariyaapt. Except for the Sukshma-Ekendriya, the other six types of Apariapt Jivasthans are considered to have Saasadan Samyaktava because when a Jiva with Aupashaamik Samyaktava leaves that Samyaktava and takes birth in Bawaar-Ekendriya, Domniya, Trischya, Chaturindriya, Asanshi-Panchendriya or Sanshi-Panchendriya, then he is considered to have Saasadan Samyaktava in the Apariapt state. But when a Jiva vomits Aumik Samyaktava, he does not digest it in Sukshma-Ekendriya, therefore, Saasadan Samyaktava is not possible in the Apariapt state. Except for Sanshi-Panchendriya, no other Jiva can have Saasadan Samyaktava in the Pariyaapt state. Because in this state, only those who have attained Aupashaamik Samyaktava are considered to be Pariyaapt, not others. ||18||

## Karmagrantha - Part Four
(2) - Gunasthanas in Marganas
[ In Five Ganas ]

"Patiri char suranarae, narasannipanidimamavatasi samve. Igavigal bhuudagavane, du da egan gaitasamdhche." ||16||
"Panch tirachi chatvari suranar ke, narasanjnipanceendriyabhavyaas sarvani. Ekavikalbhuudakavane he he ek gati prasabhavye." ||16||

**Meaning:**

There are five Gunasthanas in the five Tiryancha Gatis. There are four Gunasthanas in the Deva and Naraka Gatis. In the Manushya Gati, Santri, Panchendriyabapti, Bhaya and Trasakaya, all Gunasthanas are present. In Ekendriya, Vikalendriya, Prithvikaaya, Alakaya and Vanaspatikaaya, the first and second Gunasthanas are present. In Gasis (Tanjikaaya and Bayakaaya) and Abhashya, only the first Gunasthanas are present. ||16||

**Explanation:**

In the five Tiryancha Gatis, the first five Gunasthanas are present. This is because in these Gatis, it is not possible to be completely free from the nature of the species (jati-svabhaav) and the other Gunasthanas, like Chheka, are not possible without the presence of all the senses (sarvadhiti).

In the Deva and Naraka Gatis, the first four Gunasthanas are considered to be present. This is because Devas and Narakas are inherently devoid of freedom from their nature (viratirahita) and the other Gunasthanas are not possible without the presence of the senses (viti).

In the Manushya Gati and the other five mentioned Marganas, all types of Gunasthanas are present because all types of dimensions are possible in these Gatis.

In Ekendriya, Vikalendriya, Prithvikaaya, Alakaya and Vanaspatikaaya, two Gunasthanas are mentioned. The second Gunasthanas are only present in the state of being insufficient (aparayaaptavasta). When the lifespan of Ekendriya etc. is bound, the second Gunasthanas are not present. 

Page #152:
---------------------------
The text discusses the concept of *karmagrantha* (karmic bondage) and its impact on the attainment of *samyaktv* (right faith, knowledge, and conduct) in Jainism. 

It states that when a being is unable to attain *aupashamik samyaktv* (partial liberation), it is reborn in a state of *sasavan samyaktv* (with remaining karmic attachments) as an *ekendriya* (one-sensed being) or higher. During this period, they may experience a second *gunasthan* (stage of spiritual development) for a while. The first *gunasthan* is common to all *ekendriya* beings because they are *mithyatvi* (falsely believing) due to their lack of knowledge (*ajnana*). 

The text explains that *ekendriya* beings who attain the second *gunasthan* are *karanaparapya* (deficient in their karmic actions) but not *labdhi-aparapya* (deficient in their knowledge). This is because all beings who are *mithyatvi* are *labdhi-aparapya*.

The text then discusses the *sejakaya* (earth-bodied) and *vayukaya* (air-bodied) beings, stating that they cannot attain *aupashamik samyaktv* and that only beings who have already attained *aupashamik samyaktv* can be reborn in these forms. This is why they are considered to be in the first *gunasthan*.

The text concludes by stating that *amya* (non-human) beings only have the first *gunasthan* because they are inherently incapable of attaining *samyaktv*. It also states that attaining the second and higher *gunasthan* is impossible without first attaining *samyaktv*.

The text then provides a list of the *gunasthan* for different types of *kṣaya* (passions):

* **Three *vev* and *tom* *kṣaya* (anger, pride, and deceit):** The first nine *gunasthan* are found in these passions.
* ***Lobha* (greed):** There are ten *gunasthan* in this passion.
* ***Mayat* (incontinence):** There are four *gunasthan* in this passion.
* **Three *ajnana* (ignorance of knowledge, scripture, and discrimination):** The first two or three *gunasthan* are considered to be in these types of ignorance.
* ***Ayakshadarshan* (clairvoyance) and *chakshu* (sight):** The text does not provide information about the *gunasthan* for these. 

Page #153:
---------------------------
## Chapter 2, Karma Granth Part 4

There are twelve Gunasthanas in the first Vamsha. The last four Gunasthanas are in the Syasacharitra. ||20||

**Meaning:** Nine Gunasthanas are mentioned in the three Vedas and the three Sanjwalan-Kashaya. These should be understood in relation to Uvaya. Because their existence can be found up to the eleventh Gunasthan. By the end of the Magha Gunasthan, the three Vedas and the three Sanjwalan-Kashaya either become Son or Upshant. Therefore, their Uvaya does not remain in the subsequent Gunasthanas.

Sanjwalan Lobha should be considered in relation to the Ujya Gunasthan, because its existence can be found up to the eleventh Gunasthan.

The first four Gunasthanas in Avirati are mentioned because all the Gunasthanas from the fifth onwards are Virati-rupa.

There are two opinions regarding the number of Gunasthanas in Asan-Dhiko. The first opinion considers two Gunasthanas, while the second opinion considers three Gunasthanas. Both these opinions are Karma-granthika.

(1) The opinion of the Acharya who considers two Gunasthanas is that even though there is no complete Yatharth-Jnana due to the absence of pure Samyak-tva in the third Gunasthan, there is a small amount of Yamarth-Jnana due to the presence of Min-drishti in that Gunasthan. Because the first opinion is mentioned in the 686th verse of Gommatasar-Jiyakand. 2- "Mithyatva-adhikasyamishra-ishterasana-bahulya samyak-tva-adhikasyapuna samyak-amagahalyamiti."

Meaning: "When Mithyatva is dominant, there is an abundance of ignorance in the mixed-drishti, and when Samyak-tva is dominant, there is an abundance of knowledge." 

Page #154:
---------------------------
## Karmagranth Part Four

At the time of creation, when **mithyatva** (falsehood) is predominant, the proportion of **ajnan** (ignorance) is greater and the proportion of **jnan** (knowledge) is less. But when **mithyatva** is subdued and **samyaktvapuvagla** (right faith, right conduct, right knowledge, right effort) is predominant, then the proportion of **jnan** is greater and the proportion of **ajnan** is less. Regardless of the state of **misra-sristi** (mixed creation), due to the predominance of **jnan** in it, it is appropriate to consider the knowledge at that time as **jnan** and not **ajnan**. Therefore, there should be two **gunasthanas** (stages of knowledge) in **ajnan-trik** (three stages of ignorance).

(2) The intention of the **acharyas** (teachers) who believe in three **gunasthanas** is that although **ajnan** is called **jnan-mishrit** (mixed with knowledge) in the third **gunasthan**, it is not appropriate to consider **misra-jnan** as **jnan**. It should be called **ajnan**. Because, regardless of the type of **jnan**, it is **ajnan** without **shuddha samyaktv** (pure right faith). If **jnan** is considered as **jnan** in the third **gunasthan** due to the presence of **samyaktv**'s element, then **jnan** will also have to be considered as **jnan** in the second **gunasthan** due to the presence of **samyaktv**'s element, which is not desirable. The reason for this undesirability is that even those who believe in two **gunasthanas** in **ajnan-trik** consider **mati** (intellect) etc. as **ajnan** in the second **gunasthan**. Except for **siddhantvadi** (those who follow the principles), no other **kamdhik vidvan** (learned person) considers **mati** etc. as **jnan** in the second **gunasthan**. Therefore, it is appropriate to consider **mati** etc. as **ajnan** in the second **gunasthan** as well, just like in the first **gunasthan**, and consider **ajnan-trik** as three **gunasthanas**.

In **achakshusvarshan** (blind vision) and **chakshusvarshan** (seeing vision), there are four **gunasthanas** with this intention:

-
-
-
-

1. "**Misra-bhi ka misra**" etc. This means "In the **misra-gunasthan**, **ajnan** is **jnan-mishrit** (mixed with knowledge)." 

Page #155:
---------------------------
## Karma Nyaya Part Four

Both of these philosophies are considered to be *kshaatra-pashmika*. This means that they are absent during the *bhaamik* stage, which corresponds to the 13th and 14th *gunasthanas*. This is because *kshaayik* and *kshaayo-pashmik* knowledge cannot coexist with these philosophies.

**EX:**

The meaning of the last four *gunasthanas* in *chaaritra* is that *chaaritra* is attained when the *mohaniya karma* arises, and the absence of *mohaniya karma* persists from the 11th to the 14th *gunasthanas*. ||20||

*Mannaani sag jdhaai, samaiyachey chau bunni pariharae. Kevalgi do charma jyaai hidume.* ||21||

*Manojnaane sapta yataadiini saamaayikchchede chatvaari pariharae. Kevaldvike he charmae'yataadiini nava matishrutaavadhidvike.* ||11||

**Meaning:**

* In *manah-paryaaya-gyaan*, there are seven *gunasthanas* starting with *pramattasanyata*.
* In *saamayik* and *chhedopasthaapaniya* *sanyam*, there are four *gunasthanas* starting with *pramattasanyata*.
* In *parihara-vishuddha-sanyam*, there are *gunasthanas* starting with *pramattasanyata*.
* In *keval*, the last two *gunasthanas* are *mati-gyaan*, *shruta-gyaan*, and *avadhi-thik*. These four *marganaas* have nine *gunasthanas* starting with *adhirata-samyag-drishti*. ||214||

**Explanation:**

* The sixth to seventh *gunasthanas* are present in *manah-paryaaya-gyaan*. The seventh *gunasthan* is attained at the time of acquiring this knowledge, and other *gunasthanas* are attained after that.
* *Saamayik* and *chhevo-pasthaapaniya* are two *sanyams* that are considered to be present in the sixth to tenth *gunasthanas*. This is because, due to the absence of *veetraag-bhaav*, these *sraag-sanyams* are not possible in the higher *gunasthanas*. 

Page #156:
---------------------------
Karmagrantha Part Four

In Pariharavishuddhasangraha, the sixth and seventh are to be considered as Gunasthanas, as the श्रेणि cannot be attained while residing in it.

Both Kevalgyan and Kevaldarshan are Kshayik. Bhashik-Shaam and Kshayik-Darshan occur in the thirteenth and fourteenth Gunasthanas, hence they are considered as such in Kevalasik.

Matimaan, Shrutagyan, and Avadhi-Dwikavale are present in the nine Gunasthanas from the fourth to the twelfth. Because before attaining Samyaktva, i.e., in the first three Gunasthanas, Mati etc. are in the form of ignorance, and in the last Gunasthana, due to Kshayik-Upayog, their Amay occurs.

Here, in 'Ayavidarshan', no Gunasthana is mentioned, according to the Karmapranyik view. Karmapranyik scholars do not consider Avadhi Darshan in the first three Gunasthanas. They say that the merging of Avadhi Darshan with Vimanggyan should not be accepted. But according to the Siddhant, three more Gunasthanas should be counted in it. Siddhant accepts Avadhi Darshan in the first three Gunasthanas by considering it as merged with Vibhanggyan. || 21 ||

## Chapter Four of the Kamm Granth

There are eleven **Gunasthanas** (stages of spiritual progress) in **Aabhi** (the state of being a Jain). In **Mithyatva-Trika** (the three aspects of false belief: **Mithyadristi**, **Saasvadan**, and **Mishrashakti**), **Deshaviriti** (renunciation of worldly attachments), and **Sukshma Samparaya Charitra** (subtle conduct), each has its own unique **Gunasthan**. In **Yoga** and **Shuklaleshyamargna**, there are thirteen **Gunasthanas**. || 22 ||

**Aharak** (the state of being a Jain who consumes food) and **Bhavarth** (the meaning of the text) - In **Upsham Samyaktv** (the state of being a Jain who has attained partial liberation), there are eight **Gunasthanas**. Of these, the first four **Gunasthanas** are attained when one achieves **Granthi-Mev-Janaya Pratham Samyaktv** (the first stage of liberation), and the last four **Gunasthanas** are attained when one enters the **Upsham Shreni** (the stage of partial liberation).

**Ved Samyaktv** (the state of being a Jain who has attained complete liberation) occurs only when **Sammohaniya** (the subtle karmas that hinder liberation) arises. **Samyaktvamohaniya** (the karmas that hinder liberation) arises until the beginning of the **Shreni** (the stage of liberation) {until the seventh **Gunasthan**}. Therefore, in **Vedak Samyaktv**, only the fourth to the eighth **Gunasthanas** should be considered.

In the fourth and fifth **Gunasthanas** onwards, **Kshayik Samyaktv** (the state of being a Jain who has attained complete liberation) is attained, which remains for the **Sava** (the soul). This is why the fourth to the eleventh **Gunasthanas** are mentioned in **Kshayik Samyaktv**.

1 - See, Appendix ' '

The first **Gunasthan** is **Mithyaswaroop** (the state of false belief), the third is **Mishra Drishti** (the state of mixed belief), and the fifth is **Sukshma Samparaya Charitra** (the state of subtle conduct). This is why each **Gunasthan** is mentioned in **Sukshma Samparaya**.

There are thirteen **Gunasthanas** in the six **Margna** (paths) of **Yoga**, **Aharak**, and **Shuklaleshya**; because at the fourteenth **Gunasthan**, there is no **Yoga** of any kind, no food is consumed, and **Leshya** (the subtle karmas that hinder liberation) is not possible.

The mention of thirteen **Gunasthanas** in **Yoga** refers to the general **Yogas** like **Manoyoga** (mental yoga) etc.

The second is **Saasvadan** (the state of enjoying the senses), the third is **Bhavaroop** (the state of being in the form of emotions), the fourth is **Deshaviriti** (the state of renunciation of worldly attachments), and the tenth is **Mithyatva Trika** (the three aspects of false belief), **Beshaviriti** (the state of renunciation of worldly attachments), and...

##  Kangranth Part Four

This is expected from the fourth part of the Kangranth. The Ganasthanas are as follows, in relation to the specific Ghogs of Satyamanyog, etc.:

(a) In the five Yogas of Satyamana, Asatyamrishamana, Satya Vachan, Asatyamrishavachan, and Audarik, there are thirteen Gunasthanas.

(b) In the four of Asatyamana, Mithmana, Asatyavachan, and Mishravachan, there are the first twelve Gunasthanas.

(c) In Audarikmitra and Farmankayadyog, there are four Gunasthanas: the first, second, fourth, and thirteenth.

(d) In Vaikriyfayayog, there are the first seven Gunasthanas, and in Kriyamishrakayayog, there are five Gunasthanas: the first, second, fourth, fifth, and sixth.

(e) In Aharakkayayog, there are two Gunasthanas: the sixth and seventh, and in Aharakamadhakayayog, there is only the sixth Gunasthan. || 22 ||

Asannisus Padhambugan, Padhamtileshasu Chach Dusus Satt. Padhamtidgagajaya, Anahare Magganasu Guna. || 23 || Asanji Pu Prathamadvik, Prathamapileshyasu Shat Cha Dvamosmpt.
Prathamaatidvikayatan Yatanahare Marganasu Guna. || 23 ||

In Arthsanji, the first two Gunasthanas are found. In the three Leshyas of Krishna, Neel, and Kapoot, there are the first six Gunasthanas, and in Sej and Padam, there are the first seven Gunasthanas. In Anaharfamargna, there are five Gunasthanas: the first two, the last one, and Aviratsamyagdristi. Thus, the description of Gunasthanas in Margna is complete. || 23 ||

Meaning: In Asanji, the Gunasthanas are described. The first Gunasthan is for all types of Attis, and the second is for some Asanjis, those who are Asanji, Karan-Aparayapt Ekendiry Avi.

## Karma Nanth, Part Four, Chapter 88

No being takes birth with the taste of the five senses in the central adi, which is insufficient for the senses.

The six gunasthans are considered to be in the three leshyas of Krishna, Neel and Kapoth. The first four gunasthans are such that the said three leshyas are present at the time of their attainment and also after their attainment. But the fifth and sixth are not like that. These two gunasthans are of the form of samyaktvam and virati. Therefore, their attainment occurs at the time of the tejas maavi shubh leshyas. Not at the time of the Krishna etc. ashubh leshyas. Even though attainment happens, the ashubh leshyas also come in those gunasthans due to the remaining two of the narinam-gi.

Sometimes, the first four gunasthans are said to be in the three ashubh leshyas of Krishna etc. This is because, with respect to the time of attainment, i.e., at the time of the said three leshyas, no other gunasthans can be attained except the first four.

In the Sejolelya and Papaleshya, the first seven gunasthans are considered. This is because, with respect to the pratipadyaman and purvapratipan, i.e., at the time of attaining the seven gunasthans and also after attaining them, the said two leshyas remain.

1. This same thing is said by Shri Bhadra Bahuswami: "Sammatsuyam sadhya, su lahai sudhasu tisuy charetam. Pudhapariyano pun, annayarie u lesae." (22)

Necessary appointment, page 3. Meaning: "The attainment of samyaktvam happens in all leshyas, the attainment of charitra happens only in the last three shudh leshyas. But after the attainment of charitra, any leshya can come in the six."

2. For this, see Panchasangrah, Dwaar 1, Ga 30 and Bandhaswamitva, Ga 24 and Jeevakaand Ga, 531.

Karmagrantha Part Four

The first, second, fourth, thirteenth, and Dhobahara are the five Gunasthanas mentioned in Anaharakmarg. The first three Gunasthanas are in relation to the Anaharak state during the Vigrahagati-kalin period, the thirteenth Gunasthan is in relation to the Anaharasha state that occurs in the third, fourth, and fifth times of Kelisamudhat, and the fourteenth Gunasthan should be understood in relation to the Anaharak state that arises from Yoga-nirodha.

It is sometimes written that death does not occur in the third, twelfth, and thirteenth Gunasthanas, but it is possible in the remaining eleven Gunasthanas. Therefore, there is a doubt here: if death is possible in the remaining eleven Gunasthanas, then why are only the first, second, and fourth Gunasthanas considered in Vigrahagati?

The solution is that the statement about the presence of the aforementioned eleven Gunasthanas at the time of death is based on practical death (referring to the final time of the present bhava, in which the moksha becomes death-prone), not on certain death. The primary emergence of the lifespan of Parbhaksha is certain death. At that time, the jiva is devoid of Virati. The relationship of Vatika is only up to the final time of the present bhava. Therefore, in the time of certain death, i.e., in Vigrahagati, the fifth to eighth Gunasthanas, which have Virati, are not possible, except for the first, second, and fourth Gunasthanas. || 23 ||

## Firmgrandamag Four
(3) - Yoga in Marganas.
[From six stanzas.]

Sanayaramisas, Chamosamanvaviuviahara. Uralan Misa Kamman, Iya Joga Kammanahhare. ||24|| Satyetaramithasatyamrupamanovacho Kurvikahaarakani. Orarik Mithani Kamanamiti Yoga: Kamanamanahhare. ||24||

Mayam-Sarap, Asaty, Misra (Satyasaty) and Asatyamrus, these four are the types of Manoyoga. Vachmayoga is also of the same four types. Vaikriya, Aharak and Audarik, these three are pure and these same three are mixed, and Farman, in this way there are seven types of Kayayoga. Altogether there are fifteen Yogas.

Anaharak-Avastha mein Karman Kayayoga hota hai. ||24||

The nature of the types of Manoyoga:

Meaning - (1) The Manoyoga which contemplates the true nature of the object; for example: the Jiva is eternal from the perspective of Tasyapikanaya and non-eternal from the perspective of Paryanathikanaya, etc., that is 'Sarayamanoyoga'.

(2) The Manoyoga which contemplates the opposite of the true nature of the object; for example: the Jiva is one or eternal, etc., that is 'Asatyamanoyoga'.

(3) The Manoyoga which contemplates a mixture of truth and falsehood in some part; for example: a person has good and bad qualities, but still he is considered... 

Page #162:
---------------------------
## Karmagrantha Part Four: Understanding Bosh

This section contains a portion of falsehood, as qualities, like faults, are questioned in the form of Bosh.

(4) The method of imagination performed by the Mano Yoga, which is devoid of rules and prohibitions - the imagination that neither establishes nor removes any object, is called "Asatyamutshyamano Yoga". For example: "Oh Devavasa! Oh Indravata! Syad!" The intention of this imagination is merely to address the Dhyapravakta in the previous action, not to establish or remove any element.

The above four are in relation to the Dhyabaharanayaka. Because from the perspective of certainty, everything is included in the categories of truth and falsehood. In other words, the Mano Yoga that does not involve deceit or cunning, whether it is mixed or Asatyamutshyam, should be considered "Satyamano Yoga". Conversely, the Mano Yoga that contains an element of deceit or cunning is "Asatyamano Yoga".

**The Nature of the Divisions of Vachan Yoga:**

(1) The "Vachan Yoga" that establishes the true nature of an object, for example, saying that the Jiva is both Satrupa and Asatrupa, is "Asatyavachan Yoga".

(2) The Vachan Yoga that proves an object falsely is "Asatyavachan Yoga", for example, saying that there is no such thing as Dharma or that there is no such thing as merit and demerit.

(3) The Vachan Yoga that presents a multi-faceted object as singular is "Mishravachan Yoga", for example, calling a forest of various trees like mango, neem, and machi, simply a mango forest.

(4) The "Vachan Yoga" that is used to establish or remove an object...

## Karmagrantha Part Four, Chapter 2

**2.**  When something is not brought about, it is called **Asatyamushvavachanayoga**. For example, calling out "Hey Bhojavatta! Hey Mitrasena!" to get someone's attention are just words of address, not establishment or raising. Just like **Manoyoga** in **Yoga**, one should understand **Satya** and **Asatya** as the two **Medas** from the **Tattva-shti**.

**The Nature of the Divisions of Kayayoga:**

**(3)** The activity of the **Viryashakti** through the **Vaikriya** body alone is called **Kayayoga**. This **Yoga** is present in both **Devas** and **Narakas** in their **Paryapta** state. In humans and **Tiryachas**, it occurs only after they acquire a **Kriya** body from the forest of **Vaikriya** attainment. **Vaikriya** body refers to the body that is sometimes one and sometimes many, sometimes small, sometimes large, sometimes **Akasha-gami**, sometimes **Bhoomi-gami**, sometimes **Rahya**, and sometimes **Avashya**. Such a **Kriya** body is obtained by **Devas** and **Narakas** from the time of birth; therefore, it is called **Gati**. The **Vaikriya** body of humans and **Tiryachas** is called **Labdhipratyaya** because they obtain such a body due to **Labdhi**, not from birth.

**-**

**Bhavana:**

**(2)** The activity of the **Viryashakti** through both the **Kriya** and **Karmna** bodies, and the **Vaikriya** and **Audarika** bodies, is called **Vaikriya-Mishra-Kayayoga**. The first type of **Vaikriya-Mishra-Kayayoga** is present in **Devas** and **Narakas** from the time of their birth until their **Aparyapta** state. The second type of **Kriya-Mishra-Kayayoga** is found in humans and **Tiryachas** when they begin and abandon the **Vaikriya** body with the help of **Labdhi**.

**(3)** The activity of the **Viryashakti** through the **Aharaka** body alone is called **Aharaka-Kayayoga**. 

Page #164:
---------------------------
## Karmagrantha Part Four

**(4)** 'Aharakamiithkaay Yoga' is the activity of the *virya-shakti* (life force) that occurs through the *Aharak* and *Audarik* bodies. *Aharakamiithkaay Yoga* occurs when the *Aharak* body is taken on and when it is abandoned. *Atuurdashpoovarth* Munis (ascetics) create *Aharak* bodies through *vishist-labdhi* (special attainment) to go to another region to meet a Tirthankara, to dispel doubts, to know a subtle subject, or to see prosperity.

**(5)** *Audarikkaay Yoga* is the activity of the *virya-shakti* that occurs only through the *Audarik* body. This yoga occurs in all *Audarik* bodied beings in the *paryaapt-dasha* (sufficient state). The body that Tirthankaras and other great beings take on, through which liberation can be attained, which requires a small amount of *puv* (past) *kalas* (time periods) to form, and which is made of flesh, blood, and nerves, is called the *Audarik* body.

**(6)** The activity of the *virya-shakti* that occurs with the help of both the *Audarik* and *Kaarman* bodies is called *Audarikamiithkaay Yoga*. This yoga occurs in all *Audarik* bodied beings from the second time of birth until the *aparyaapt* (insufficient) state.

**(7)** The tendency of the *virya-shakti* that occurs only through the *Kaarman* body is called *Kaarmankaay Yoga*. This yoga occurs in all beings during the *vigrah* (disintegration) state and at the first time of birth. It also occurs in *keli* (pleasure) *samudhaat* (accumulation) at the third, fourth, and fifth times. The *Kaarman* body is made of *karm-pudgalas* (karmic particles) and is mixed with the *aatma* (soul) in the same way that milk is mixed with water. The *Kaarman* body is the foundation of all bodies, meaning that when this body is completely destroyed, the cycle of rebirth ends. The being then takes a new birth... 

Page #165:
---------------------------
## Karmagrantha Part Four

When a being goes from one place to another to receive something, it is enveloped by a body. This body is so subtle that even though it has a form, it cannot be perceived by the eyes or other senses. This body is called "Sookshma Sharira" or "Ling Sharira" in the Vaishnavic scriptures.

Although another body called "Tejas" is also considered, which digests the consumed food and is used by specific lump-bearing ascetics for Tejo-leshya. Therefore, it may be doubted whether Tejas-kayayoga is also necessary like Karman-kayayoga.

The solution to this doubt is that Tejas-sharira and Karman-sharira are always together. That is, the liberated soul sometimes leaves the Karman-sharira, but never the Tejas-sharira. Therefore, the activity of the vital force, which is done through the Karman-sharira, is also done by the Tejas-sharira according to the rules. Therefore, Tejas-kayayoga is included in Karman-kayayoga. Hence, it is not considered separately.

**The concept of Yoga in the Eight Paths:**

Of the fifteen Yogas discussed above, Karman-kayayoga is the only one found in the Anaharak-Ayaspa state. The remaining Yogas are found only in the Aharak state. It is not a rule that Karman-kayayoga occurs only in the Anaharak state. Because even in the fourteenth Gunasthan, in the Anaharak state, there is a kind of...

"The nature of the said subtle body is described as 'Saptadarshak Lingam'."
- Saankhya Darshan - Chapter 3, Verse 1. 

Page #166:
---------------------------
## Karmagranth Part Four

**Chapter 4**

Karmayoga does not occur. It is not a rule that during the time of Karmakayayoga, the Anaharaka state is necessary. Because even when Karmakayayoga occurs at the moment of birth, the being is not Anaharaka, but rather takes nourishment through that very Yoga. However, it is a rule that when a being is in the Anaharaka state, no other Yoga occurs except Karmakayayoga. Therefore, in the Anaharaka state, only Karmakayayoga is considered. ||24||

**Verse 25**

Naragani, Ditsatannu, Achakhyunaranapusakasamvumage, Sannichale Sahaaraga, Bhavamuohidage Sabve. ||25||

**Verse 25**

Na Ragatapanceindriya Yatra Sa Tanvanakshanaranapusaka Kakshayasamyavaddhike, Manjishangleshyahaaraka Bhavyamitishrutaavavidvivve Sarve. ||25||

**Meaning:**

Human path, Panchepriya jati, Prasaphaya, Kayayoga, Achadarshan, Purushaved, Napusaka Ved, four Kshayas, Kshayika and Bayopashamike, these two Sammatvatvas, Sanji, six Leshyas, Aharaka, Bhavy, Matimaan, Shrutagyan and Avadhi Dvik. In these twenty-six Marganas, all fifteen Yogas occur. ||25||

**Meaning:**

The above twenty-six Marganas are mentioned because all of them are related to the human Paryaya, and all Yogas are possible in the human Paryaya.

Although it is sometimes stated that Karmayoga does not occur in the Aharaka Margana, and the remaining fourteen Yogas occur, this does not seem logical. Because at the first moment of birth, no other Yoga is possible except Karmayoga. Therefore, at that time, Mahakasva can be reduced through Karmayoga.

The nourishment taken at the first moment of birth, in which... 

Page #167:

## Karmagrantha Part Four

**Pugals are the means.** Therefore, at that time, there is no need to believe in Karmankayayoga. To do so is futile. Because in the first instance, the pugals taken in the form of food can become the means of taking food in the form of the body at that very moment, but they cannot become the means in their own nature. ||2||

**Tiryanchati, Ajasasana, Anaanauvasama, Abhavyam, Mithyatva, these twelve are the means of destruction, pacification, fear, and false belief. In the case of Devas and Narakas, there are thirteen means, excluding the Audarik-Dwik.** ||26||

**Meaning:** In the ten paths of Tiryanchati, Striveda, Aviriti, Sasvadan, Three Agnanas, Upashama Samyaktava, Abhavyam, and Mithyatva, there are thirteen yogas, except for the Aharak-Dwik. In the paths of Devas and Narakas, there are eleven yogas, excluding the Audarik-Dwik, out of the aforementioned thirteen. ||26||

**Explanation:** In the paths mentioned above, starting with Tiryanchati, all yogas are present except for the Aharak-Dwik. Out of these, the reason for the absence of Aharak-yoga in the eight paths excluding Striveda and Upashama Samyaktava is the absence of Sarvaviratka. In Striveda, although Sarvaviratka is possible, the reason for the absence of Aharak-yoga is the restriction on women, which includes the four prohibitions...reading is prohibited. In Upashama Samyaktava, although Sarvaviratka is possible, the reason for not considering Aharak-yoga is that those who have attained Upashama Samyaktava do not use Aharak-nadi.

1. See, Appendix 'T'. 

Page #168:
---------------------------
The Karmagrantha states that there are thirteen yogas in Tiryanchagati. Of these, four are Manoyoga, Dharvananayoga, and one is Audarikakayayoga. Thus, these nine yogas are in the sufficient state. Vainkriyakapayoga and Vainkriyamiśrakayayoga are in the sufficient state; but not for all Tiryanchas; but for some Tiryanchas who are strong in Vainkriya, they are in the sufficient state. Karman and Audarikamiśra, these two yogas, are only in the insufficient state for Tiryanchas.

In Strived, the thirteen yogas are possible as follows: four of the mind, four of the speech, two Vainkriya, and one Audarik, these eleven yogas are in the sufficient state for humans, Tiryanchas, and Stri. Kriyamiśrakayayoga is in the insufficient state for Devstri, Audarikamiśrakayayoga is in the insufficient state for humans, Tiryanchas, and Stri, and Karmankayayoga is in the sufficient state for humans and Stri, and in the Kevalisamuddhata state for Stri.

In the seven marganas of Adhirati, Sampashti, Sasvavan, three agyanas, Abhavya, and Mithyatva, the ten yogas of the mind, four of the speech, Audarik, and Vainkriya are in the sufficient state. Karmankayayoga is in the Vivahpasis and in the first moment of birth. Audarikamiśra and Vainkriyamiśra, these two yogas are in the insufficient state.

1- Strived here refers to Dravyastrived. Because the absence of Aharakayoga is possible in it. In Bhavastrived, Aharakayoga is possible, i.e., one who becomes a man from Dravya and experiences Bhavastrived, is also one who has Aharakayoga. Similarly, in the future, where twelve uses are mentioned in the Veda, the Veda here also refers to Dravyaved. Because Kshayik-use is only for Bhagaveda, twelve uses cannot occur in Bhavaveda. Conversely, in Gunasthan-Adhikar, Veda refers to Bhavaveda. Because nine Gunasthanas are mentioned in the Veda, they can only occur in Bhavaveda, Dravyaved remains until the fourteenth Gunasthan. 

Page #169:
---------------------------
## Karmagrantha Part Four:

In the state of Upasama Samyaktv, the four mental, four verbal, Audarik and Vaishyik, these ten yogas are found in the sufficient state. Karman and Mankriya Mishra, these two yogas should be understood in the insufficient state in relation to the Devas, because those who believe that those who fall from Upasaman, die and are born in the Anuttar Vimana with Upasama Samyaktv, according to their opinion, these yogas are found in the insufficient Devas at the time of Upasama Samyaktv. Audarik Mishra yoga is given in Upasama Samyaktv, according to the theoretical opinion, not according to the Karmagranthic opinion, because according to the Karmaprasthika opinion, this yoga is not found in anyone except the family in the sufficient state. In the insufficient state, it is found in humans and Tiryanch, but they do not have any kind of Upasama Samyaktv in that state. According to the theoretical opinion, Audarik Mishra yoga can decrease in Upasama Samyaktv; because theoretical scholars do not consider Vaikriya Mishra yoga at the time of the creation of the Kriya body, but consider Audarik Mishra yoga; therefore, this yoga can be found in a human being with Vaikriya Sabdhi Sampatra, who has the Upasama Samyaktv of Pranya-Meva-Janaya, at the time of the creation of the Vaikriya body.

Devagati and Narakagati do not have the possibility of Viraati, and the Audarik body is not possible. Therefore, these four yogas are mentioned in the said two gattis; so it should be. || 26 ||

1 - This opinion has been indicated by the author himself in the 46th verse ahead, with this part:

"From being, there are Vyavaharik yogas, and from those, there are Audarik yogas, except for the remaining eleven yogas, as far as possible, consider them."

## Karmagrantha Part Four

**Verse 27:**

In the stationary karma-grantha, the active drikas are five in the wind. In the final speech-yoga, they are four, including the bankriya-dvik.

**Commentary:**

In the stationary karma, there are three yogas: karma, audarik, and vik. In the one-sense beings and the wind, there are five yogas: the three mentioned above, plus the bankriya-dvik. In the asanjna, there are six yogas: the five mentioned above, plus the final speech-yoga (asatyamrishanachan). In the vikalendriya, there are four yogas: the six mentioned above, minus the bankriya-dvik (karma, audarik-mishra, audarik, and asatyamrishanachan).

**Explanation:**

The three yogas mentioned in the stationary karma are to be understood in all four types of stationary beings except the wind. This is because there are two more yogas possible in the wind. Of the three yogas, the karma-kaya-yoga is to be understood in the state of disintegration and at the time of birth, the audarik-mishra-kaya-yoga is to be understood in the insufficient time except at the time of birth, and the audarik-kaya-yoga is to be understood in the sufficient state.

In the one-sense beings, the wind is also included. Therefore, in addition to the three yogas, the bankriya-yoga is considered, making a total of five yogas.

In the wind, like other places, the three yogas, karma, etc., are considered. But besides these, there are two more yogas (vaikriya and baniyamishra). This is why there are five yogas in the wind. In the wind, the sufficient power...

**Note:** The same thing is mentioned in the prajnapanani.

## Chapter Four of the Karma Granth

**10.**  Jivas who are endowed with the ability to acquire a Vaikriya body are the only ones who possess the Vaikriya-dvik. Not all Jivas possess this. The Vaikriya-mishraka-yoga occurs when the Vaikriya body is being formed, and the Vaikriya-ka-yoga occurs when the body is fully formed and being sustained.

Six yogas are mentioned for the Asanji. Five of these yogas are related to the Vayufayako, because all Asanji are one-sensory. The sixth yoga, Asatyamrishvaranayayoga, is related to the Dwindriya and above, because the Dwindriya, Trindriya, Chaturindriya, and Samucchim-panchendriya are all Asanji. The Dwindriya and above Asanji Jivas are endowed with the ability to speak, and therefore they possess the Asatyamrishvaranayayoga.

Four yogas are mentioned for the Vikalendriya. Because they are not endowed with the ability to form a Vaikriya body, they cannot form a Vaikriya body. Therefore, they do not possess any of the six yogas mentioned for the Asanji. ||27||

"Kammuralameesavinu man, vaisa mahayaddeyachakshumannanaane. Uraldugakamm padham, -timamanavai kevaladurgami." ||28||

"Kamaudari kamishram vina manovacharasamayik mahendachakshumanojnane. Audarikati karmapayamantimamanovacha kavala-vike." ||29||

The six Ma-gangas are: Manoyoga, Vachanayoga, Samayikcharitra, Chevopasthapamiyacharitra, Chakshuvarshan, and Manoparyaya-jnana.

In the commentary on the Pakva Sangrah-dwar 1, it is stated as evidence: "Niham tav rasiinam, veniyallalo ghedh narip. Vaparpajjatana pi, sankhejjai bhagas ti."

This means: "The three types of Vayukayikas, namely, the insufficient and sufficient subtle, and the insufficient gross, do not possess the ability to acquire a Vaikriya body. The sufficient gross Vayukayika does possess this ability, but not all of them; only a countable portion of them possess it."

### F

There are thirteen yogas except for Karman and Audarik Mishra. Only in the Dwik, there are seven yogas: Avarik Vik, Karman, the first and last Manoyog (Satya and Asatyamushyamano yog), and the first and last Vachan yog (Satya and Asatyabhushavachan yog). ||28||

**Meaning:** The above six Marganas (Manoyog etc.) are found only in the Paryapt Avस्था (state of perfection). Therefore, Karman and Audarik Mishra, these two yogas are not found in the Aparyapt Avस्था (state of imperfection). The Kevali (omniscient being) has these yogas in the Kevalimuddat (state of complete liberation). Therefore, although they are possible in the Paryapt Avस्था, it should be understood that when these yogas are present in the Kevalimuddat, none of the above six Marganas are present. Therefore, except for the above two yogas, the remaining six Marganas are mentioned.

In the Keval Dwik, seven yogas are mentioned, including Audarik-tik etc., as follows: - The Yogi Kevali always has the Audarik Kayayog; it is only absent in the six intermediate times of the Kevalimuddat. The Avarik Mishra Kayayog is present in the second, sixth, and seventh times of the Kevalimuddat, and the Karman Kayayog is present in the third, fourth, and fifth times. The two Vachan yogas occur during the time of delivering a sermon, and the two Manoyogas occur when answering a question mentally. The meaning of answering mentally is that when a Dev (god) or a Man Paryayajnani (knower of the cycles of existence) who is not a Tirthankara, while remaining in their own place, mentally pleases the Kevali, then the Kevali, knowing their pleasure through his Kevalgyan (omniscience), mentally answers them. In other words, he receives the Manoyog and creates a response accordingly.

2 - See, Appendix 'Th'.
2 - In the 228th verse of Gommatasar-Jivakand, the Kevali is also considered to have a connection with the Dravya Man (substance of mind).

The Kevali Bhagwan, who possesses Avadhijnana (clairvoyance) and Manahparyaya Jnana (knowledge of the mind), can understand the answer to a question by observing the mental state of the questioner. Although the mind is very subtle, Avadhijnana and Manahparyaya Jnana have the power to directly perceive it. Just as a psychologist can infer someone's mental state by observing subtle changes in their facial expressions, similarly, an Avadhijnani or Manahparyaya Jnani can directly observe the mental state and infer that this particular mental state must have been created by thinking about a specific meaning.

**Chapter 26**

**Ten Yogas**

There are ten Yogas: four for the mind, four for the speech, and one for the Audarik (generous) in Pariharavishuddha (purified conduct) and Sukshmasamprayacharita (subtle conduct). In the Mishra (mixed) state (Samyagmithyashti), there are nine Yogas mentioned above, plus one Vaikriya (changeable). In Deshaviriti (withdrawal from the world), there are nine Yogas mentioned above, plus Vaikriya-Dwik (double changeable). In Yathashyatacharita (conduct according to reality), there are four Yogas for the mind, four Yogas for the speech, and Audarik-Dwik (double generous), totaling eleven Yogas.

**Eleven Yogas**

**Meaning:** The Karman (action) and Audarik Mishra (mixed generous) Yogas are insufficient for the attainment of liberation, but Charitra (conduct) is never insufficient. The Vaikriya and Vaikriya Mishra Yogas are experienced only by those who use the mind. However, one who has Pariharavishuddha or Sukshmasamprayacharita never uses the mind. The Aharak (food) and Aharak Mishra (mixed food) Yogas are fourteen...

The liberated Muni (Jain monk) is from a past life. However, one who possesses a pure conduct (**Parihar Vishuddha Charitra**) can be from ten past lives, and one with a subtle conduct (**Sookshma Samparaya Charitra**) can be from a hundred past lives, but still be considered impure. Therefore, in **Parihar Vishuddha** and **Sookshma Samparaya**, there are six **Yogas** (states of being) that do not exist: **Karmna**, **Aavarik Mishr**, **Vaikriya**, **Vaikriya Mishr**, **Aaharaka**, and **Aaharaka Mishr**. The remaining nine **Yogas** do exist.

At the time of **Mishra Samyaktv** (mixed right faith), death does not occur. Therefore, in the **Apariapta** (imperfect) state, **Samyaktv** (right faith) is not attained. This is why the **Yogas** of **Karmna Aavarik Mishr** and **Vaikriya Mishr** do not exist in the **Apariapta** state. Also, at the time of **Mishra Samyaktv**, knowledge from fourteen past lives is not possible, so the **Aaharaka Yoga** does not exist. Thus, excluding the aforementioned five **Yogas** (**Karmna** etc.), the remaining **Yogas** exist in **Mishra Samyaktv**.

There is a doubt that in **Mishra Samyaktv**, the **Vaikriya Mishr Yoga** is not considered to be in the **Apariapta** state. This is correct. However, when using the **Vaaniya Labdhi** (gaining knowledge through the senses), the **Vaikriya Mishr Yoga** that occurs in the **Pariyapta** (perfect) state for humans and **Tribandha** (three bonds) is not considered in **Mishra Samyaktv**. The solution is that both **Mishra Samyaktv** and **Vaikriya Mishr Yoga** (gained through **Labdhi**) are in the **Pariyapta** state. However, they do not coexist. This means that at the time of **Mishra Samyaktv**, the use of the senses is not done, so the **Vaikriya Mishr Yoga** does not exist.

A **Vratdhari** (one who observes vows) is not **Pravak** (a liberated soul), **Chaturvash-Purvi** (from a hundred past lives), or **Apariapta**. Therefore, in **Desh Virati** (renunciation of the world), eleven **Yogas** are considered, excluding the two **Aaharaka** and the **Apariapta** state **Karmna** and **Aavarik Mishr**, making a total of four. The eleven include **Vaikriya** and **Vaikriya Mishr**.

Therefore, it is well-known in the scriptures that a Shravaka, due to their Vaiphiyalabdhi, can obtain a Vaishya body, like 'Ambar' etc.

A person with perfect conduct is always vigilant. Therefore, in that conduct, there are not four yogas that are associated with Pramava, namely two Pankriya and two Aharaka, but eleven others. The eleventh Karma and Bhava Rikamishra, these two yogas are counted, only in relation to the Kevali Samudra. In the sixth and seventh times of the Kailisamudra, there is Audarikamishra, and in the third, fourth, and fifth times, there is Karmanyoga. ||26||

(4)-Usage in Marganas.
[From six stanzas]
Tianaan Naan Pan Cha 3, San Bar Jiyalakshanavoga. Vinu Mannaanadukeval, Nav Surtiriniryaajaesu ||30||
Piinyajnanani Maamani Pancha Chatvari, Darshanani Dwadash Jivalamanamupyogaah. Vina Mamojnanadikeval Nav Surtirmanirayayateshu ||30||
Meaning: These twelve usages, which are the characteristics of the jiva, are five knowledge and four darshanas. Of these, the three usages of Maata, Paryaya, Karma and Kevala-dik are not found in the nine usages of vevagati, tiryanvagati, narakagati and avirati. ||30||
Maavarth: The characteristic of any object is its extraordinary dharma. Because the purpose of a lakshya is to show the lakshya as different from other objects. Which can only happen in extraordinary dharma. Usage is the extraordinary (special) dharma of the jiva and distinguishes it from other beings. For this reason, they are called the characteristics of the jiva.
Mana: Paryaya and Kevala-dik, these three usages are relative to sarvavirati. But vevagati, tiryanvagati, narakagati and avirati, these four marganas do not have the possibility of sarvavirati. Therefore, excluding these three usages, the remaining nine usages are considered.
Those who are in avirati, the pure samyakdravya should be considered to have six usages, three knowledge and three darshanas, and the rest should be considered to have five usages, three ignorance and two darshanas. ||30||

**Karmagrantha** Chapter Four

**Verse 31**

*tasajoyeyasukka, haranarani visannibhaava satve. nayaneyarapnaleesa, kasaai dasa kevalabuguna.*

*asayogavedasuklaaharaka narapanchindriyasangibhye sarve. nayaneyatarapanchaleesyaakashaye dasa keval dvivona.*

**Meaning:**

In the thirteen categories of *braskaatha*, three *yoga*, three *veva*, *shulka leeshya*, *ahaaraka*, *mamuchyagati*, *panche priyajaati*, *sanji* and *bhavy*, all ten *kevala* qualities are present.

Except for *chakshudarshan*, *avakshurvarshan* and *shulka*, the remaining five *leeshya* and four *kashaya* are present in the eleven categories, excluding the two *kevala* qualities.

**Explanation:**

Out of the thirteen categories mentioned above, *yoga*, *shurukaleeshya* and *ahaarakatva* are present until the thirteenth *gunasthan* (stage of spiritual development), while the remaining ten are present until the fourteenth *gunasthan*. Therefore, twelve *kevala* qualities are present in all these categories.

The presence of *deva* in the fourteenth *gunasthan* refers to the *dravya veva* (material aspect of existence), as the *bhaava veva* (spiritual aspect of existence) is present only until the twelfth *gunasthan*.

*Chakshudarshan* and *avakshurvarshan* are present until the twelfth *gunasthan*, *krishna* and the other two *leeshya* are present until the sixth *gunasthan*, *tema* and *padma* are present until the seventh *gunasthan*, and *favapochay* is present until the eighth *gunasthan*. Therefore, in the eleven categories mentioned above, excluding the two *kevala* qualities, the remaining ten *kevala* qualities are present.

**Verse 32**

*charidia sanni vriana, nadasan igibitithavari achakchu. tianaan sanadurga, anaanati gaabhavi micchayuge.*

## Karmagrantha Part Four

**Verse 32:** In the four-sensory and non-sentient five-sensory beings, there are two types of knowledge (mati and shruta) and two types of vision (chakshu and achakshu), making a total of four functions. In the one-sensory, two-sensory, three-sensory, and five-sensory stationary beings, there are three functions, excluding chakshu-darshan (visual perception). In the three ashanas (abhaya, mithyatva-vik, and mithyatva-sarasadan), there are three types of knowledge and two types of vision, making a total of five functions.

**Explanation:** In the four-sensory and non-sentient five-sensory beings, there is no capacity to attain vibhangalana (knowledge of the nature of karma), and due to the absence of samyaktva (right faith), the five types of knowledge associated with samyaktva, as well as avadhi and kevala, are not present. Therefore, only four functions remain.

In the one-sensory and other beings mentioned above, due to the absence of matra (measure) and samyaktva, the five types of knowledge, avadhi, and kevala, as well as the capacity for vibhangalana, are not present. Therefore, only three functions remain.

In the three ashanas mentioned above, there is no samyaktva or virati (cessation of karma). Therefore, the five types of knowledge, avadhi, and kevala are not present. Therefore, only five functions remain.

**Note:** The Siddhantis (those who believe in the existence of the soul) and Vibhangamanis (those who believe in the existence of karma) consider avadhi-darshan (clairvoyance) to be present in the ashanas. However, the Sasvavanguṇasthānas (those who believe in the existence of both the soul and karma) do not consider avadhi-darshan to be present in the ashanas.

**For further clarification, please refer to the commentary on verses 21 and 46.**

## Chapter Four: The Path of Liberation

**32.** In the path of liberation, knowledge is not considered. Therefore, according to the path of karma, it should be considered.

**33.** Only in the state of liberation, the nine types of knowledge are not present. In the state of liberation, there are only two types of knowledge: **kevalgyan** (omniscience) and **kevaldarshan** (omniscient perception).

**33.** In the state of liberation, there are only two types of knowledge: **kevalgyan** (omniscience) and **kevaldarshan** (omniscient perception). In the state of **kshaypika samyaktv** (perfect knowledge) and **yathakyat charitra** (perfect conduct), there are nine types of knowledge remaining. These nine types of knowledge are: three types of **gyan** (knowledge) and three types of **darshan** (perception) in the state of **dinati** (the first stage of liberation). These are the types of knowledge that are present in the state of liberation. In the state of **misra-shti** (mixed state), these types of knowledge are present in a more subtle form.

**Explanation:** The reason why only **kevalgyan** and **kevaldarshan** are considered in the state of liberation is that the other types of knowledge are not present in the state of liberation.

In the state of **kshaypika samyaktv**, there is no **mithyarav** (false perception). In the state of **yathakyat charitra**, there is **mithyarav** in the eleventh **gunasthan** (stage of spiritual development), but it is only **sattagat** (existent) and not **udayaman** (arising). Therefore, in these two stages, there are no three types of **mithyarav**-related knowledge. The remaining nine types of knowledge are present. These nine types of knowledge are: seven types of knowledge in the state of **chhavastha** (the sixth stage of liberation) - four types of **gyan** and three types of **darshan** - and two types of knowledge in the state of liberation - **kevalgyan** and **kevaldarshan**.

In the state of **deshavirati** (the first stage of liberation), there are no three types of **agyan** (ignorance) because there is no **mithyatva** (falsehood). In the state of **sarvavirati** (the second stage of liberation), there are no three types of **agyan** because there is no **mithyatva** and because it is dependent on **sarvavirati**.

**Note:** This is the same view as mentioned in the **Gommatasar-Jivakanda** in the 704th verse.

Kevala-nik, these three uses are also not used. The remaining ones are. The six have been counted in Avadhi-vikka because the description of Avadhi-use is found in the scriptures for the Pravaks.

In Misra-rasthi, there are no six uses, 'Yo Nir' in it; but the special feature is that in Misra-rasthi, three Shans are mixed, not pure, i.e. Mati-gyan, Mati-agyan-mithit, Taman, Bhut-agyan-mixed and Avadhiman, Vimang-gyan-mixed. The mixture is considered because at the time of Misra-rasthi-munasthan, due to the awakening of the Bhani-Vishuddha Banimohamiya-pus, the results are partly pure and partly impure, i.e. mixed. Purity is called Mati etc. from the point of view of expectation, and impurity is called Sham from the point of view of expectation.

In Gunasthan, the Avadhi-vashan is related to the Kam-ampik side. The first side, in the first Gunasthan etc., has Avapina Mamata, which is specified in the 21st verse. The second side, in the third Gunasthan, considers Avadhi-darshan, which is specified in the 48th verse. In this place, taking the second side, Avadhi-darshan has been counted in the uses of Misra-rasthi. || 33 ||

## Chapter Four of the Karma Granth

**And the three versions of the Avadhi and the three versions of the Kevala Darshan**

In the **Gram Samyakta**, **Bewak** (meaning **Kshayopa-samik-samyak-darshan**), there are four **Shan** and seven **Upayog** in the twelve **Margnaas**. || 34 ||

**Niti** and **Moksha** have **Anaharaktava**. There are eight **Upayog** in **Vigrah-Gati**. For example: **Bhaavi Tirthankar** etc., **Samyaktava**, **Mithyatva**, three **Jnanas** for **Mithyatva**, three **Ajnan** for **Mithyatva**, and **Avakshu** and **Avadhi** for both **Samyaktava** and **Mithyatva**, these are the two **Darshans**. In **Kevala-Samuddhat** and **Moksha**, **Kevala-Jnana** and **Kevala-Darshan** are the **Upayog**. In this way, there are a total of ten **Upayog** in the **Anaharak-Margna**.

**Manah-Paryaya-Jnana** and **Gaur-Kshu-Darshan**, these two **Upayog** are not included in the **Anaharak-Margna** because they are **Paryapt-Avashtha-Bhaavi**. Except for the four **Kevala-Jnanas**, there are four **Jnanas**, **Yatha-Khyat** **Charitra**, **Aupashamik**, **Kshayopa-samik**, two **Samyaktavas**, and **Avadhi-Darshan**, these eleven **Bhargavas** are found only from the fourth to the twelfth **Gunasthanas**. Therefore, three **Ajnan** and **Kevala-Dwik**, except for these five, the remaining seven **Upayog** are considered.

Here, three **Ajnan** are not considered in **Avadhi-Darshan**. So, according to the **Karma-Granthik** statement in the 21st **Gatha**, "**Jayaad Nav Mahasu-Shi-Durga**", it should be understood. || 34 ||

**Boter Tar Baras, Mane Kama Att Du Cha Cha Vaynan. Chadu Pan Tini Kay, Jiyagun-Jog-Ovoganne.** || 35 ||

**Trayodash Trayodash Dwadash, Manasi Kramad-Ast Dwe Char-Var-Chatvaro Banane. Chatvari Dwe Pach Trayah Karya, Jivagun-Yog-Upayoga Anye.** || 35 ||

**Meaning:** Other **Acharyas** say that in **Manoyog**, the **Jivasthan** is two, the **Gunasthan** is thirteen, the **Yog** is thirteen, and the **Upayog** is twelve. In **Vachan-Yog**, the **Jivasthan** is eight, the **Gunasthan** is...

## Karmagrantha Chapter 4, Verse 35

**Verse:**

"Four types of Karmagrantha are sought,
In the four types of Yoga,
In the four types of Kayayoga,
The Jiva's state of being,
The Gunasthanas,
Five types of Yoga,
And three types of use are considered."

**Commentary:**

Previously, the consideration of the Jiva's state of being, etc., in Manoyoga, Vachanayoga, and Kayayoga was done without any specific intention. However, in this verse, a specific intention is being considered. This means that each type of Yoga is being considered as much as possible without the other types of Yoga, and the Jiva's state of being, etc., is being shown within it.

The meaning of "as much as possible" is that when Manoyoga is present, Vachanayoga and Kayayoga are also present as companions. However, this is not the case with Vachanayoga and Kayayoga. Vachanayoga can be found without Kayayoga, and even in the presence of Dwindriya, etc., it can be found without Manoyoga. Therefore, it is considered without Manoyoga. Kayayoga can be found in Ekendiya without both Manoyoga and Vachanayoga. Therefore, it is considered without them.

In Manoyoga, there are two states of being: Aparayapta and Paryapta. Aparayapta is not present because in other states of being, Manoyoga does not occur due to the lack of sufficient material like Manah, etc. In Manoyoga, there are thirteen Gunasthanas because there is no Moha Yoga in the fourteenth Gunasthan. The Paryapta state of Manoyoga is Bhava, therefore, in it, there are thirteen types of Yoga, excluding the two types of Aparayapta states: Karman and Audarik Mishra. Although these two types of Yoga are present even in the Paryapta state during the time of Kevali Samudghat, they are not considered because they are not relevant at that time. Therefore, even in that state, Manoyoga does not occur with these two types of Yoga.

All types of knowledge are found in beings with Manah. Therefore, twelve types of use are mentioned in Manoyoga. 

Page #183:

## Karmagrantha Part Four

**Verse 17** considers only the sufficient **Jiva-sthana** (state of being) for **Mano-yoga** (mind-yoga), considering those with present **Mano-yoga** as **Mano-yogi** (practitioners of mind-yoga). This verse considers both insufficient and sufficient **Sanni-Panchendriya** (five senses with limited or full awareness) **Jiva-sthana** for **Mano-yoga**, considering those with present and future **Mano-yoga** as **Mano-yogi**. The explanation of **Jiva-sthana**, **Yoga** (practice) and **Upayoga** (application) in verses 22, 28, and 31 is also applicable here. However, the repetition is meant to highlight the differences in opinion. 

**Jiva-sthana** and **Yoga** are considered differently in **Mano-yoga**. For example, in **Mano-yoga**, insufficient **Sanni-Panchendriya** is also considered **Mano-yogi**, but this is not the case in **Soma** (a different type of yoga). Only those who practice **Yoga** concurrently with **Mano-yoga** are considered **Mano-yogi**. This is why **Karma** (action) and **Audarik-Mishra** (mixed with Audarika) **Yoga** are not included in **Mano-yoga**.

**Vachan-yoga** (speech-yoga) considers **Jiva-sthana** as follows: **Dwi-Indriya** (two senses), **Tri-Indriya** (three senses), **Chatur-Indriya** (four senses), and **Asati-Panchendriya** (five senses without full awareness), these four are both sufficient and insufficient. Here, **Vachan-yoga** is considered without **Mano-yoga**, so it is present in these eight **Jiva-sthana**. Verse 17 considers general **Vachan-yoga**. Therefore, in that verse, **Vachan-yoga** only includes **Sanni-Panchendriya** **Jiva-sthana**. Another difference is that verse 17 considers those with present **Vachan-yoga** as **Vachan-yoga** practitioners. However, this verse considers those with both present and future **Vachan-yoga** as **Vachan-yoga** practitioners. This is why five **Jiva-sthana** are considered in **Vachan-yoga** in that verse, and eight here.

**Vachan-yoga** includes the first and second **Guna-sthana** (state of qualities), **Audarik**, **Audarik-Mishra**, **Karma**, and **Asalya-Mushyavan** as four **Yoga**; and **Mati-Agnana** (knowledge and ignorance), **At-Anam** (without name), **Chin** (thought), and **Atra-Bhuvan-arshan** (earthly desires) as four **Upayoga**.

In the 22nd, 28th, and 31st verses, thirteen Gunasthanas, thirteen Yogas, and twelve Upayogas are mentioned in sequence. There is no reason for this difference. That is, the Vachan Yoga is taken in a general sense, but in this verse, it is specific - without Manoyoga. Previously, in Vachan Yoga, contemporary Yoga was intended, therefore, Karban-Haramishraya and insufficient state future Yogas were not counted. But in this Yoga, it is. Because of the reason and Shri Darimishra, being in an insufficient state, it is not contemporary with the sufficient state Vachan Yoga, yet the said Yoga is Vachan Yoga in the middle. For this reason, these two Yogas are included.
In Kayayoga, there are two sufficient and two insufficient, a total of four Jeevasthanas, the first and second Gunasthanas, Audarik, Audarik Mishra, Vaikriya, Kriyamishra, and Karman, these five Yogas, and Mahi-Agyanashrut-Agyan and Bhavan, these three Upayogas should be understood. In the 16th, 22nd, 25th, and 36th verses, four Jeevasthanas, thirteen Gunasthanas, fifteen Yogas, and twelve Upayogas are mentioned in Kayayoga. The meaning of this difference is also according to the above statement. That is, here, the general Kayayoga is taken, and the Jeevasthanas etc. are considered. But in this place, it is specific. That is, Manoyoga and Vachan Yoga, the Kayayoga that is beneficial to them, which is found only in one sense organ, is taken. ||35||

(4) - Leshyas in the Maganas. Six Leshyas are present in the Ekendriya, Asanshipanchetriya, Prithvikaaya, Jalakaaya and Vanaspatikaaya Maganas. The first three Leshyas are present in the Narakati, Vikaleviya-Trika, Agni-kaaya and Vayu-kaaya Maganas. ||36||

Six Leshyas have their own respective places in the Ekendriya, Asanshipanchetriya, Prithvikaaya, Jalakaaya and Vanaspatikaaya Maganas. The first four Leshyas are present in the Narakati, Vikaleviya-Trika, Agni-kaaya and Vayu-kaaya Maganas. ||33||

**Meaning:** The six Leshyas have their own respective places in the six Maganas. This does not mean that a being can only have one Leshya at a time. Because all six Leshyas are mutually exclusive in terms of their time of occurrence. A being with Krishna Leshya will only have Krishna Leshya. Similarly, the other Leshyas should be understood in the same way.

**Further Meaning:** In the above-mentioned five Maganas, the four Leshyas from Krishna to Tejas are considered. Out of these, the first three can be attained due to the Bhava-pratyaya, but this is not the case with Tejo-leshya. It is only attained in an incomplete state. The reason for this is that when a being with Tejo-leshya dies and takes birth in Prithvikaaya, Jalakaaya or Vanaspatikaaya, it retains the Tejo-leshya of its previous birth for some time.

In the beings of the above-mentioned six Maganas, such inauspicious results occur that they do not become eligible for the Leshyas beyond the first three, namely Krishna, Adi and Trika. ||36||

(6) - The Fewness and Manyness of the Marganas. [From eight verses]

**Verse 37:**
*Ahlaya sulbhakevala - dughi sukka lavi sesththane su. Narniryadevatiriya, thova du asan swarntaguṇa'*

**Translation:**
*As for the Yathasyatacharitra, Sukshmasamprayacharitra, and Kevala Dik, there is only a small amount of Shulkaleshya in these Marganas; in the remaining Margasthana, there are all six Shkayas.*

**Verse 37:**
*Yatharupatsukshm kevala dwike shukla shadpidoṣasthāneṣu. Narniryadevatiryanchaḥ stokavyakṣyānantguṇāḥ*

**Translation:**
*As for the Yathasyatacharitra, Sukshmasamprayacharitra, and Kevala Dik, there is only a small amount of Shulkaleshya in these Marganas; in the remaining Margasthana, there are all six Shkayas.*

**Meaning:**
*As stated, the Yathasyatacharitra, Sukshmasamprayacharitra, and Kevala Dik, in these Marganas, there is only Shulkaleshya; in the remaining Margasthana, there are all six Shkayas.*

**Verse 37:**
* [Gati Margana's Fewness and Manyness:-] Humans are the fewest, Narakas are countless times more than them, Devas are countless times more than Narakas, and Tiryanchas are infinite times more than Devas.*

**Meaning:**
*In the above four Marganas, starting with Yathasyata, the results are so pure that it is not possible to have any other Leva except Shulkaleshya. In the previous verse, there were seventeen Marganas, and in this verse, there are four, including Yathasyatacharitra, making a total of twenty-one Marganas.*

**Note:**
*From here to the 44th verse, there is a discussion of the fewness and manyness of fourteen Marganas; it is taken from the third section called "Fewness and Manyness of Prajnapana". In that section, there is a discussion of the fewness and manyness of thirteen doors besides the Marganas. The fewness and manyness related to Gati is on page 116 of Prajnapana. To understand this fewness and manyness specifically, the number of humans, etc., is shown in the explanation of this verse, which is described in the Anushogadwar: - Human number, page 205; Naraka number, page 106; Asura Kumar number, page 200; Vyantar number, 10208; Jyotishka number, page 208; Vaimanika number. There is a similar description in the Panchasangraha: - Vyantar number, Dwa 2 0 14; Jyotishka number, Dwa 2, Ga 15; Human number, Dwa 2 0 21.*

Except for these, the remaining forty-one paths are found here. The paths are:

Devagati, 1 Manushayagati, 1 Tiryanchagati, 1 Panchendriya jati, 1 Sakaya, 3 Yoga, 3 Me, 4 Kavaya, 4 Gyan (Mati etc.), 3 Agyan, 3 Charitra (Samayik, Chelopasthapaneya and Pariharvishuddha), 1 Deshaviriti, 1 Aviriti, 3 Darshan, 1 Sampatva, 1 Avyashva, 3 Samyaktva (Ki, Kshayopshaamik and Aupshraamik), 1 Ban, 1 Samyamdhyasy, 1 Michnatva, 1 Sajhim, 1 Parakh and 1 Anaharaktva, total 41.

1. Sasa

[The mutual comparison of humans, narakas, devas and tiryanchas in terms of less, more etc. is explained above. To understand it properly, it is shown according to the method described in human numerology]:

Humans, the unpardonable, are nineteen in number and the excellent, are countless.

(a) Jghanya: - The womb-born and the samuchchhin humans are in this category. Among these, the samuchchhin humans do not exist at all at any time, only the womb-born exist. The reason for this is that the lifespan of samuchchhin humans is an antarmuhurt. When the time difference between the birth of samuchchhin humans becomes more than one antarmuhurt, all the previously born samuchchhin humans die. Thus, when there is no birth of new samuchchhin humans and all the previously born samuchchhin humans have died, only the womb-born humans remain, who are at least equal to the nineteen mentioned below. Therefore, this is the minimum number of humans.

The sixth square, with the fifth year, should be multiplied by itself thirty-nine times. For example: 2 multiplied by 2 is 4, this is the first square. 4 multiplied by 4 is 16, this is the second square. 16 multiplied by 16 is 256, this is the third square. 256 multiplied by 256 is 65536, this is the fourth square. 65536 multiplied by 65536 is 4294967296, this is the fifth square. This fifth square, when multiplied by itself, results in 1544674407370951616, this is the sixth square. Multiplying this sixth square by the number of the previous five squares results in 76228162514264337563543950336, these are the thirty-nine numbers. Alternatively, 1 multiplied by 2 is 2, 3 multiplied by 4 is 12. In this way, by doubling the previous number, the thirty-nine numbers are obtained.

(3) **Excellent:** When the number of souls in the universe is at its peak, then the number of humans is also at its peak, reaching an innumerable amount. There are innumerable numbers of souls, and among them, the number of souls that are suitable for humans is described in the scriptures in two ways: time and space.

1. The product of two equal numbers is called the square of that number. For example: 5 squared is 25.
2. These thirty-nine numbers are mentioned in the 157th verse of the Gommatasara-Jivakanda, using letters as symbols for the number of humans in the womb.
3. See Appendix.
4. Space is considered extremely subtle. Because the number of regions in the Bhu-Shreni, which are the size of an angul (finger), is considered equal to the number of moments in an innumerable Avyapini (time period).

## Chapter Four of the Karma Granth

(1) **Question:** How many humans can exist at the same time in the infinite universe?

(2) **Answer:**  To calculate the maximum number of humans, we need to consider the following:

* **Densely populated realms:** These realms are like strings (rajjus) and have a specific number of entries (angalamatra).
* **Third and first square roots:**  We need to calculate the third and first square roots of the number of entries in these realms.
* **Division:**  Divide the total number of entries in all the realms by the product of the third and first square roots of the number of entries in a single realm.
* **Subtraction:** Subtract one from the result of the division.

The resulting number represents the maximum number of humans that can exist at the same time.

**Example:**

* Let's assume there are 3,200,000 entries in all the realms.
* Let's assume there are 256 entries in a single realm.
* The first square root of 256 is 16.
* The third square root of 256 is 2.
* Multiplying the third and first square roots, we get 32.
* Dividing the total number of entries (3,200,000) by 32, we get 100,000.
* Subtracting 1 from 100,000, we get 99,999.

Therefore, according to this calculation, the maximum number of humans that can exist at the same time is 99,999.

**Note:**

* The actual number of humans is infinite (asanka).
* This calculation is just a way to understand the concept.
* The number of entries in the realms, the square roots, and the total number of realms are all vast and immeasurable.

**Quote:**

"When the time is right, the universe will be filled with humans. They will be countless, like the stars in the sky." - **Aavashyak-Niyukti, page 31, verse 37**

**Footnotes:**

1. The nature of densely populated realms, realms, and entries is explained in the 7th verse of the 5th chapter of the Karma Granth.
2. The square of a number is the number multiplied by itself.
3. This calculation of the maximum number of humans is also mentioned in the 156th verse of the Gommat Sar-Jivakand.

There are countless hell beings, but the countless number of hell beings is countless times greater than the countless number of humans. The number of hell beings is described in the scriptures as follows: There are main periods of time for the descending and ascending cycles. And in the region of the seven-stringed, dense, localized world, in the region of the Anga-only, there are as many index categories as there are in the second square root of the first square root of the number of index categories. The number of hell beings is equal to the number of regions in the index categories. This can be understood by imagining that there are 256 creation categories in the Anga-only region. The first square root of this is 16, and the second is 4, which when multiplied together gives 64. There are 64 index categories, and according to the 3,200,000 regions of each index category, there are 64,204,600,000 entrances, and there are that many hell beings.
116
This was done by multiplying 16 by 4. For each index category, there are
Countless are the Bhavanapati Devas. The number of Asura Kumaras among them is described as follows: The number of Asura Kumaras is equal to the number of entrances in the index categories that can fit in the countless part of the first square root of the number of regions in the Anga-only sky region. Similarly, the number of Naga Kumaras and other Bhavanapati Devas should be understood in the same way.
To understand this number, imagine that there are 256 entrances in the Mangala-only sky region. Their first square root will be 16
1 - The number of hell beings in the Gommatasara is two, which does not match this number. For this, see the 152nd verse of the Jivakanda.
2 - The Gommatasara does not give a separate number for each category, but shows the number of all Bhavanapatis together. For this, see the 160th verse of the Jivakanda.

If we assume 18 Kalpas to be equal to an uncountable number of parts, then there are 2 Asurakumaras equal to the regions of 2 Adhi-Dhenis. Each Sudhigini is assumed to have 320,040 Praveshas. In total, there are 6,400,0007 Praveshas in 2 Sachishreni. This number of Asurakumaras, etc., should be considered equal to each Bhavanapati, which is actually uncountable.

The number of Pantar Vedas of a particular type is described as follows:

The number of Praveshas in a Yोजन-Praman Adhishish is divided by the time-Pantar's Pradeshas. The number of Pradeshas obtained in the division is the number of Pantar Devas of each type.

To understand this, imagine that there are 1,000,000 Praveshas in a Sadayat Pojan-Praman Adhi-Ni. According to the assumed number of 3,200,000 Pradeshas in each Sushu-Shreni, there are 10,240,000,000,000 Praveshas in total. Now, dividing this number by 1,000,000, we get 10,240,000. This is the number of Yantar Nikayis. This number is actually uncountable.

The uncountable number of Jyotishi Devas is assumed as follows:

The number of Pradeshas in the time-Pantar is divided by the number of Praveshas in 256 Asal-Praman-Shreni. The quotient obtained is the number of Jyotishi Devas.

**_ _ 1** The measure of Tryantar is found in Gommatasar. See, the 156th verse of the Jivakand.

**2** The number of Jyotishi Devas is different in Gommatasar. See, the 156th verse of the Jivakand. 

Page #192:

The Karmagrantha asks for the number of Vaimanika Devas. This can be understood through calculation. There are 256 Vashas, and dividing the total number of Kalpita (10240000000000) by 256 gives 156250000. This is the number of Vaimanika Devas, as understood by the Jyotishis.

The number of Vaimanika Devas is countless. This can be understood as follows: The number of Vaimanika Devas is equal to the number of entrances in the Suchi श्रेणियों, which is equal to the cube root of the number of entrances in the sky, which is equal to the number of entrances in the sky multiplied by itself three times.

For example, there are 256 entrances in the sky. The cube root of 256 is 22. The number of entrances in the Suchi श्रेणियों is 2560000, as each Suchi श्रेणी has 3200000 entrances. This is the number of Vaimanika Devas.

The number of Bhavnapati, Dhyantar Jyotishis, and Vaimanika Devas combined is countless times greater than the number of Narakas.

The number of Tiryanchas is countless times greater than the number of Devas because there are countless numbers of Anamskaayik Vanaspati Jivas, which are also Tiryanchas. This is because Vanaspati Jivas experience the Karma of Tiryanchagati.

**Note:** The terms "Vashas," "Kalpita," "Suchi श्रेणियों," "Bhavnapati," "Dhyantar Jyotishis," "Vaimanika Devas," "Narakas," "Tiryanchas," "Anamskaayik Vanaspati Jivas," and "Tiryanchagati" are all Jain terms.

## Chapter Four: The Karma Granth

**The Fewness and Manyness of Indriyas and Kayamarganas:**

**Verse 38:**  There are countless qualities in the three (types of beings).  Just as there are countless colors in the earth, water, and air, so too are there countless qualities in the five, four, three, two, and one indriyas.

**Verse 37:**  The five-indriya beings are the fewest.  The four-indriya beings are more numerous than the five-indriya beings, the three-indriya beings are more numerous than the four-indriya beings, and the two-indriya beings are more numerous than the three-indriya beings.  The one-indriya beings are countless in number.

**Meaning:**  The five-indriya beings are the fewest.  The four-indriya beings are more numerous than the five-indriya beings, the three-indriya beings are more numerous than the four-indriya beings, and the two-indriya beings are more numerous than the three-indriya beings.  The one-indriya beings are countless in number.

The sakayika beings are fewer than the other sakayika beings.  The agnikayika beings are countless in number compared to the sakayika beings.  The prithvikaayika beings are more numerous than the agnikayika beings, the jalakayika beings are more numerous than the prithvikaayika beings, and the vayukayika beings are more numerous than the jalakayika beings.  The vanaspatikayika beings are countless in number compared to the dhapukaayika beings.

**Meaning:**  The two-indriya beings are said to be as numerous as the number of regions in the countless kotis of yojanas, which is the measure of the length of a suchi (needle).  The three-indriya, four-indriya, and five-indriya beings are said to be equal in number to the two-indriya beings.

**Notes:**

1. This explanation of the fewness and manyness is found on pages 120-123.  The Gommatasar's explanation of the indriyas is similar to this one, stating that the two-indriya beings are more numerous than the five-indriya beings.
2.  The number of one type of being is considered "visheshyadhik" (more numerous) than another type of being as long as it is not double the number of the other type.  For example, the number 4 is considered "visheshyadhik" than the number 3, but the number 6 is not considered "visheshyadhik" than the number 3 because it is double the number 3.

Therefore, there is a doubt that when the Agamas state that the number of Dwindriya Aavi beings is equal, how can the above-mentioned small and large number of Panchendriya and Aani beings decrease? The solution is that there are countless types of countless numbers. Therefore, the term "Asankhyata Kotakoti Yojana-Praman Suvi Shreni" should be taken differently everywhere, not as the same seven numbers. The quantity of Panchendriya Tiryanchas should be considered so small that even when all other Panchendriya beings are added together, the total number of Panchendriya beings is still less than the number of Chaturindriya beings. Ekendriya beings are said to be infinite from Harendriya beings because the beings of the ordinary Vanaspatikaaya are infinite, all of whom are Ekendriya.
All types of Sadhanokrim Lokas are not even equal to one Pratar of the regions, and only Tejas-Kayika beings are equal to the entrances of the Asalyaat Lokakarna. For this reason, the largest and Tejas-Kayika beings are considered to be countless times greater than them. Tejas-Vik, Prithvi-Kayika, Alakayika, and Vayu-Kayika, all of these are generally mentioned in the Agamas as being countless Lokakasha-Pravesh-Praman. However, the countless numbers related to their quantity should be understood differently. Vanaspathikaayika beings are said to be infinitely greater than Vayu-Kayika beings because the beings of Nigoda are infinite Lokakasha-Pradesh Praman, who are Vanaspathikaayika. ||38||

## The Few and the Many in Yoga and the Vedic Path

##  Manavayanakaya Yoga: Few are the Manavayanakaya Yogis, countless and infinite are the others.  Men are few, women are countless and infinite times more than men. ||36||

##  Manobachan Kayayogas: Few are the Manobachan Kayayogis, countless and infinite are the others.  Men are few, women are countless and infinite times more than men, and eunuchs are countless and infinite times more than women. ||136||

## Meaning: 

Those who practice Manoyoga are few compared to those who practice other yogas. Those who practice Vachanayoga are countless times more than those who practice Manoyoga, and those who practice Kayayoga are infinite times more than those who practice Vachanayoga.

##  Men are the fewest. Women are countless times more than men, and eunuchs are infinite times more than women. ||36||

##  Explanation:

Those who practice Manoyoga are considered few because Manoyoga is only found in sentient beings. And sentient beings are few compared to all other beings. Those who practice Vachanayoga are considered countless times more than those who practice Manoyoga because two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, five-sensed, and sentient five-sensed beings all practice Vachanayoga. Those who practice Kayayoga are considered infinite times more than those who practice Vachanayoga because in addition to those who practice Manoyoga and Vachanayoga, there are also one-sensed beings who practice Kayayoga.

##  Animals are three times more numerous than animal men, and three times more than that are women.

##  1 - This discussion of the few and the many is found in the 134th chapter of the Prajnapanna. The Gommatasar considers the number of yogas to be fifteen. See, Jiva Grantha, verses 258-266.

##  The Vedic discussion of the few and the many is slightly different. See, Jiva Grantha, verses 273-250.

It is said that the number of women in the human race is twenty-seven times greater than the number of men. Similarly, the number of goddesses is twenty-five times greater than the number of gods. This is why women are considered to be more numerous than men. All beings from one-sensed to four-sensed, as well as all non-sentient five-sensed beings and hell beings, are all eunuchs. Therefore, eunuchs are considered to be infinitely more numerous than women. || 36 ||

**The scarcity and abundance of passions, knowledge, restraint, and the path of liberation:**

**Three stanzas:**

**40.** Those who are proud are few compared to those who have other passions. Those who are angry are more numerous than those who are proud. Those who are deceitful are more numerous than those who are angry. Those who are greedy are more numerous than those who are deceitful.

Those who have knowledge of the mind are few compared to all other knowers. Those who have knowledge of perception are infinitely more numerous than those who have knowledge of the mind. Those who have knowledge of intellect and those who have knowledge of scripture are equal to each other, but they are still more numerous than those who have knowledge of perception. Those who have knowledge of the divisions are more numerous than those who have knowledge of scripture. || 40 ||

**Meaning:** Those who have pride are fewer than those who have other passions because the state of pride is less than the state of other passions like anger. Anger lasts longer than pride. Therefore, those who are angry are more numerous than those who are proud. The state of deceit is greater than the state of anger, and it lasts longer than anger. Therefore, those who are deceitful are more numerous than those who are angry.

This is found in more beings. This is why Mayavi's are said to be more than Krodhi's. The reason for saying that Lobhi's are more than Mayavi's is that the rise of Loma remains until the tenth Gunasthan, but Maya is only until the ninth Gunasthan.

Those who are human beings, restrained, and possess many attainments, they have Manas-paryaya-jnana. This is why Manas-paryaya-jnani's are less than all other Jnanis. Some humans have Avadhi-jnana of Tiryanchas, and all Devas and Narakas have Avadhi-jnana. This is why ignorant Manas-paryaya-jnani's are countless times less than Avadhi-jnani's. Except for Avadhi-jnani's, all Samyak-tvi humans and Tiryanchas have Mati-shruta-jnana. Therefore, Mati-shruta-jnani's are slightly more than Avadhi-jnani's. Mati-shruta-jnani's are companions of the rules, this is why Mati-shruta-jnani's are equal to each other. The reason for Vibhang-jnani's being less than Mati-shruta-jnani's is that the Mithyadristi Devas and Narakas, who are Vibhang-jnani's, are countless times less than Samyak-tvi beings. || 40 ||

There are infinite qualities even in the Siddhas, and all of them are 
* **Mati-agyani** (ignorant of knowledge)
* **Sadhar** (ordinary)
* **Bhus-agyani** (ignorant of the past)

Therefore, it is only logical that **Mati-agyani** and **Bhus-agyani** have infinite qualities compared to the Knowers. Just like **Mati** and **Jnana** (knowledge), **Mati** and **Shruta-agyani** (ignorant of scriptures) are companions by rule. Therefore, **Mati-agyani** and **Shruta-agyani** are equal.

* **Sukshma-samparaya** (subtle) **Charitris** (conduct) are excellent from two hundred to nine hundred.
* **Parihar-vishuddha** (purified by avoidance) **Charitris** are excellent from one thousand to nine thousand.

* **Avashur-darshani** (those who have **Avashur** vision) have **Ananta-guna** (infinite qualities) compared to **Kevala-darshani** (those who have **Kevala** vision).

* **Chhedopasthapaneya** **Charitris** are excellent from two hundred crore to nine hundred crore.
* **Samajika** (common) **Charitris** are excellent from two thousand crore to nine thousand crore.

Therefore, these are considered to have **Sankhya-guna** (numerical qualities) in the above-mentioned way.

## Chapter Four of the Karma Granth

**The concept of "Alp-Bahusv" (few-many) is explained.**

It is said that beings with "Kapolaleshya" (a type of karma) have an infinite number of "Vanaspatika" (plant) lives. This is why those with "Kapolaleshya" are said to have infinite merits compared to those with "Tejoleshya" (another type of karma).

Those with "Neelaleshya" (another type of karma) have even more merits than those with "Kapolaleshya." From "Lantaka" (a type of hell) to "Ghonka" (a type of heaven), and from "Sanatkumar" (a type of heaven) to "Brahmaloka" (the highest heaven), there are countless "Vaimanika Deva" (celestial beings who travel in aerial vehicles). Similarly, compared to the "Vaimanika Deva" like "Sanatkumar," the "Jyotisha Deva" (celestial beings who are associated with light) have countless merits.

Therefore, there is a doubt: why are those with "Padmaleshya" (another type of karma) and "Shuklaleshya" (another type of karma) considered to have a finite number of merits, rather than infinite merits, compared to those with "Tejoleshya" and "Padmaleshya" respectively?

**The solution to this doubt is as follows:**

It is true that "Padmaleshya Deva" have infinite merits compared to "Shuklaleshya Deva." However, "Shuklaleshya Deva" have infinite merits compared to "Padmaleshya Deva." Similarly, while "Tejoleshya Deva" have infinite merits compared to "Padmaleshya Deva," "Tiryancha" (animals) have infinite merits compared to "Tejoleshya Deva." Therefore, all those with "Shuklaleshya," "Padmaleshya," and "Tejoleshya" have a finite number of merits compared to each other.

In summary, if the comparison of merits is made only between the "Deva" (celestial beings) and the three types of "Leshya" (karma) mentioned above, then it would be considered infinite. However, this comparison is made considering the general "Neevarashi" (a specific type of karma), and the number of "Tiryancha" with "Shuklaleshya" compared to "Padmaleshya Deva," and the number of "Tiryancha" with "Padmaleshya" compared to "Tejoleshya Deva," is so large that the finite number of merits can be considered "Alp-Bahusv" (few-many).

Shri Jayam Moksur has written about the "Alp-Bahusv" nature of merits from "Shuklaleshya" to "Tejoleshya." He has explained this by interpreting the phrase "Do Sanstha" (two types) in the relevant verse as "Do'sanstha" (two types). He has also mentioned in his commentary that some manuscripts have the reading "Do Sankha" (two numbers), which suggests that the finite number of merits should be understood as "Alp-Bahusv." However, this reading is not authentic. The correct reading is "Do Sankha."

Based on this, the doubt regarding the "Alp-Bahusv" nature of finite merits has been resolved. The learned Shri Malayagiri Suri has explained the "Alp-Bahusv" nature of merits and the "Leshya" path in his commentary very clearly. (Page 1633)

## Karmagrantha Part Four

This happens in beings. Because the *neelaleshya* *kapota* has a more complex *adhyasay* form than the *krishna* *leilya*, and the *krishna* *leilya* has the most complex *adhyasay* form than the *neelaleshya*. Thus, the number of beings with more and more results increases progressively.

The middle beings, the *abhavya* beings, the beings called *jghanayukta*, are countless.

The *amudhya* *ananta* number is infinite; because the *amudhya* *ananta* number is infinite, but the *ashya* is infinite.

Those beings who lean towards *mithyatva* after attaining *aupashamika* *samyak* are called *sasaram* *samyakta*, not others. Therefore, *sasaram* *samyakta* are rarely found among all other *drishti* holders. All the beings who attain *aupashamika* *samyakta* do not vomit that *samyakta* and turn towards *mithyatva*, but only a few do; therefore, the *samsthagan* who remain stable in it are found more than those who fall from *aupashamika* *samyakta*. || 43 ||

The number of *misa* is infinite, the number of *ashya* is infinite. The number of *sanjeeta* is infinite, the number of *anaahara* is infinite. || 44 ||

The *misa* are infinite in number, the *ashya* are infinite in number. The *kshavika* *samyakta* beings are countless times more than the *mithyatva* beings.

## Karmagrantha Maag Chaar, Chapter 132

**Verse 44:**

* **Sanjnee Jeevas** (conscious beings) are less in number than **Asanjnee Jeevas** (non-conscious beings), and **Asanjnee Jeevas** are infinitely more numerous than **Sanjnee Jeevas**.
* **Anahaarak Jeevas** (non-consuming beings) are less in number than **Aahaarak Jeevas** (consuming beings), and **Aahaarak Jeevas** are countless times more numerous than **Anahaarak Jeevas**.

**Explanation:**

* There are two types of beings who attain **Mishradristi** (mixed vision):
    * Those who attain it after leaving the first **Gunasthan** (stage of spiritual progress).
    * Those who attain it after falling from **Samyashti** (perfect vision).
* This is why beings with **Mishradristi** are countless times more numerous than those with **Aupashmik Samyagdrishti** (partial perfect vision).
* Beings with **Mishradristi** are countless times more numerous than those with **Kshayopaashmik Samyagdrishti** (almost perfect vision) because the state of **Kshayopaashmik Samyagdrishti** is much higher than **Mishrasamyagdrishti**.
* **Mishrasamyagdrishti** lasts only for a moment, while **Kshayopaashmik Samyagdrishti** lasts for a long time, like the duration of countless oceans.
* **Kshayik Samyagdrishti** (perfect vision) is infinitely more numerous than **Kshayopaashmik Samyagdrishti** because **Siddhas** (liberated souls) are infinite and they all have **Kshayik Samyagdrishti**.
* **Mithyavies** (those with false beliefs) are infinitely more numerous than **Kshayik Samyagdrishti** because the majority of beings in the universe are **Mithyavies**, and they are even more numerous than **Siddhas**.

**Further Explanation:**

* **Devas**, **Naks**, **Garbhja Manusya** (human beings born from the womb), and **Garbhja-Tyantr** (beings born from the womb) are **Sanjnee**. All other beings in the universe are **Asanjnee**, including the infinite number of **Vanaspatikayik Jeevas** (plant-like beings). This is why **Asanjnee Jeevas** are considered more numerous than **Sanjnee Jeevas**.
* **Siddhas** are **Anahaarak** (non-consuming) because they are in the third, fourth, and fifth stages of **Vigrahgati** (the process of liberation), and they are also in the fourteenth **Gunasthan**. All other beings are **Aahaarak** (consuming). This is why **Aahaarak Jeevas** are considered countless times more numerous than **Anahaarak Jeevas**.
* **Vanaspatikayik Jeevas** are even more numerous than **Siddhas**, and because they are part of the universe, they are **Aahaarak**.
* There is a doubt about whether **Aahaarak**... (the text ends abruptly here)

Karmagranth Part Four
Oh, the number of Anaharakas should be infinite compared to the number of Anantmanas, how can they be countless?
133
The solution is that there are infinite beings in each Nigod sphere; an innumerable part of them dies every moment and remains in the state of Viprgati. It has been said above that the beings present in Viprgati are Anaharakas. These Anaharakas are so numerous that the number of full-fledged Aharaka beings can never be infinite compared to the total number of Anaharakas, but they remain countless. ||144||

## Karmagrantha Part Four
## Appendix to the Second Chapter
## Appendix "J"

On the "Yogamarga" Vaman on page 52, line 23, the three yogas are explained in the Rajavartika by showing their barren and internal causes. Its summary is as follows:

**(a)** The pulsation of the soul's province, which is directed towards contemplation, due to external and internal causes, is "Manoyoga". Its external cause is the dependence on Manovargna, and its internal cause is the destruction and cessation of the Veerayantrayakarma, and the destruction and cessation of the No-Indriya Avaranakarma (Manonadhi).

**(b)** The pulsation of the soul's province, which is directed towards speech, due to external and internal causes, is "Vachanayoga". Its external cause is the dependence on Vachanavargna, which arises from the rise of the Puglavapiaki Sharira Karma, and its internal cause is the destruction and cessation of the Veerayantrayakarma, and the destruction and cessation of the Matijnana Avarana and Aksharashruta Shana Avarana, etc. (Vachanalabdhi).

**(c)** The pulsation of the soul's province, which is directed towards the subject of movement, etc., due to external and internal causes, is "Kayayoga". Its external cause is the dependence on some kind of Shariravargna, and its internal cause is the destruction and cessation of the Veerayantrayakarma.

Although the internal cause, the destruction of the Veerayantrayakarma, is the same during both the thirteenth and fourteenth Gunasthanas, the external cause, the Vargnaalambana, is not the same. That is, it is found during the thirteenth Gunastana, but not during the fourteenth Gunastana. This is why there is Yogavidhi in the thirteenth Gunastana, but not in the fourteenth. For this, see Tattvartha Adhyaya 6, Sutra 1, Rajavartika 10.

## Regarding the subject of Yoga:

**(a)** There is a doubt that Manoyoga and Vachanayoga are the same as Kayayoga; because during both these yogas, the body's activity is always present. 

Page #206:

And the reception of the mind-substance and speech-substance, which are the objects of these yogas, also takes place through some kind of bodily-yoga.
"The solution to this is that mental yoga and verbal yoga are not separate from bodily yoga; but are special kinds of bodily yoga. The bodily yoga that helps in contemplation is called mental yoga at that time, and the bodily yoga that is helpful in speaking is called 'verbal yoga' at that time. In short, three divisions of bodily yoga have been made for the sake of practice.
(b) There is also a doubt that the bodily yoga that helps in breathing should be called 'breathing yoga' and there should be four yogas instead of three.
1
The solution to this is that the specific purpose of language and mind is seen in practice, but the purpose of breathing and body is not the same as that of mind and body, so only three yogas have been considered. For a special consideration of this subject, one should see the commentary 0356-364 and the Lokaprash-Sarg 3, Shloka 1354-1355.

**Nature of Mind-Substance, Speech-Substance and Body:**
(a) The pudgalas that are fit to become mind, which are called 'manovaggana' in the scriptures, when they become mind-like - capable of helping in thinking, they attain such a state, they are called 'mind'. There is no specific place for the mind-substance in the body and its fixed shape is not mentioned in the Svetambara scriptures. According to the Svetambara sect, the mind-substance should be understood as pervading the body and having the shape of the body. In the Digambara sect, its place is considered to be the "heart and its shape is considered to be like a lotus".
(b) A type of pudgala that becomes speech-like, which is called 'bhashavaggana', is called 'speech'.
(c) That which enables walking, eating, drinking, etc., which is the place of experiencing pleasure and pain, and which is made up of audarik, vaikriya, etc. vagganas, is called 'body'.

## Appendix "J"
## Page 65, Line 8, on the word "Samyaktava"

To understand its nature, especially its specific types, it is very useful to consider the following points:

(1) Is Samyaktava caused or uncaused? (2) What is the basis for the distinctions like Shramik, etc.?
(3) The characteristics of Aupashmik and Shreyopashmik Samyak, and the differences between them, as well as the characteristics of Kshayik Samyak.
(4) The nature of Samadhana, Vipaday, and Pradesh-odaya. And the explanation and clarification of Upayam.

(1) - Is Samyak a result or uncaused? The answer to this question is that it cannot be considered uncaused; because whatever is uncaused should be the same in all times, in all places, or its absence should be there. Samyaktava-result is neither the same in all nor is its absence. Therefore, it should be considered caused. When we consider it caused, the question arises as to what its definite cause is; the external causes like listening to sermons, worshiping the Bhagavan, etc., which are considered as external causes, cannot be the rules of Samyaktava, because even in the presence of these external causes, the definite cause for the manifestation of Samyaktava-result in many beings is the special nature of the Anadi Parinaamik called Jiva's Tathavidha Bhavya-tva. When this Parinaamik Madhyatva matures, then Samyaktava is attained. Bhavya-tva result is like a curable disease. Some curable diseases are cured by themselves (without external remedies). For the cure of some curable diseases, treatment of the bondage is also necessary, and there are also some curable diseases that disappear after many days. Bhavya-tva-nature is like this! The Madhyatva of many beings attains maturity without external causes. There are also beings whose Bhavya-tva nature matures with the need for external causes like listening to scriptures, etc. And the Bhavya-tva result of many beings matures by itself after a long time has passed. The external causes like listening to scriptures, worshiping the Arhat, etc., are only cooperative. Sometimes they help in the maturation of Madhyatva, so in practice they are considered as the cause of Samyaktava, and the need for their support is shown. But from the point of view of certainty, the maturation of Tathavidha-Bhavya-tva is the only Samyaktava.

### 137

**Avyabhichari** (certain). The reason should be considered. From this, the non-absoluteness of external actions like scripture-listening, image-worship, etc., which depends on the difference in the recipient, is revealed. This same point has been expressed by Bhagwan Umaswati in 'Tanisargadadhigamadha' - Tasyarth-A. 1, Sutra 3, and the same point is also in the Malayagiri commentary on Pashchagah-Dwar 1, Ga.

**(2)** The diversity of the internal causes that manifest **Samyaktva** (right faith), which is the basis for the various distinctions like Kshayopaamik, etc., is as follows: The destruction of the seven natures, namely the Anantanubandhi Chatushk and Darshanamohaniya-Trika, is the cause of Kshayopa-shama, Kshayopa-shamik-Avyavasa, Upam, Aupasha-bhivasamyaktva, and Kshaya, Kshayik-Samyaktva. And the arising of the Anantanubandhi Kshaya, which pulls one down from Samyaktva and inclines towards Mithyatva (false faith), is the cause of Sasadan-Samyaktva, and the arising of the Mishramohaniya is the cause of Mishra-Samyaktva. The specific description of what other causes are required for Aupamik-Samyaktva, like Kalalabdhi, etc., and how it occurs in different states with different sins, as well as the description of Kshayik and Kshayo-pashmiv-Samyaktva, are respectively in the Tattvarth-A. 2, Moo. 3, 1st and 2nd Rajattik, and in Su. 8 and 5, these Rajattik.

**(3)** At the time of Aupasha-mik-Samyaktva, there is no arising of Darshanamohaniya in any way; but at the time of Kshayopa-mik-Samyaktva, there is the Vipako-day of Samyaktva-mohaniya and the Pradesh-o-day of Mithyatva-mohaniya. Due to this difference, in the scriptures, Aupamik-Samyaktva is called 'Bhavasamyaktva' and Kshayopa-shamik-Samyaktva is called 'Pratyaksham-Samyaktva'. Kshayik-Samyaktva is distinct from these two Samyaktvas because it is permanent, and these two are impermanent.

**(4)** There is a doubt that Mohaniya-karma (karma that causes delusion) is Vaatik (permanent). It destroys Samyaktva and Charitra-paryaya (conduct), so how can the Vipako-day of Samyaktva-mohaniya and the Pradesh-o-day of Mithyatva-mohaniya manifest the Samyaktva-parinam (result of right faith)? The solution is that while Mithyatva-mohaniya is indeed Mohaniya-karma, its Dalik (sub-particles) are purified. Because when the destructive essence of the Dalik of Mithyatva-mohaniya karma is destroyed by pure Adhyavasaya (firm conviction), then those same Dalik, which have a single-place essence and a two-place essence, are called 'Samyaktva-mohaniya'. Just as transparent objects like glass, etc., do not obstruct the function of eye-sight, similarly, the Vipako-day of the purified Dalik of Mithyatva-mohaniya does not hinder the manifestation of Samyaktva-parinam.

---------------------------
## Karmagrantha - The Path of Four

Now, the emergence of Mithyatva (false belief) is discussed. However, it does not hinder the outcome of Samyaktva (right belief); because it is only the emergence of the dull Dalikas (karmic particles) that is being discussed. Just as the dull Dalikas, which are weak in their Rasa (taste), do not have their poison emerge when the Gunas (qualities) are not destroyed, similarly, the emergence of dull Dalikas cannot be considered as a possibility for the destruction of the Gunas. See the commentary on the 11th Gunasthan in the Pancha Sangrah, Chapter 1, verse 15.

(5) The synonym for Kshayopa-shama (destruction and pacification) is "Shayopa-shaamik" and the synonym for Upa-shama (pacification) is "Aupa-shaamik". Therefore, to understand the true nature of any "Baya-opashik" and "Aupa-shaamik" state, it is essential to first understand the nature of Kshayopa-shama and Upa-shama. Hence, its nature is described according to the scriptural process...

In Upa-shama, there are two... Mama Ma. The word "Kshayopa-shama" means both the destruction and pacification of Karma. The meaning of destruction is the severance of the specific connection of Karma with the soul, and the meaning of pacification is the Karma remaining attached to the soul in its own form, but not affecting it. This is the general meaning; however, its technical meaning is slightly different. When the Bandhavali (bondage) is complete, and the Upa-shama of a particular Karma begins, then the Dalikas from the present time to the Avali (period of bondage), which are carried by the Udayatralika (path of emergence) or Udiran Dalikas (emerging Dalikas), are destroyed (non-existence) through Pradesh-o-thama (emergence) and Vipaka-o-dya (fructification). And the Dalikas which are not eligible to emerge from the present time to the Avali, which are called Upayavali-bahit (not carried by the path of emergence) or Anudiran Dalikas (non-emerging Dalikas), undergo Upa-shama (lack of ability to fructify or transformation from the three Rasas to the weak Rasa). As a result, when these Dalikas obtain their Udayavali (path of emergence), their Pradesh-o-dya or weak Vipaka-o-dya becomes weak, meaning they cannot or only minimally manifest their fruit on the soul.

Thus, the destruction of the Karma Dalikas that emerge until the end of the Avali through Pradesh-o-dya and Vipaka-o-dya, and the lack of ability to fructify or the transformation of the three Rasas into the weak Rasa of the Karma Dalikas that are eligible to emerge after the Avali, is called Kshayopa-shama.

Karma eligible for Kshayopa-shama: Kshayopa-shama does not occur for all Karmas; it only occurs for Ghatikarma (destructive Karmas). There are two types of Ghatikarma: Desha-vaatik (local) and Sarva-ghati (universal). There is some difference in their Kshayopa-shama.

(a) When the Kshayopa-shama of Desha-vaatik Karma begins, then...

## Karmagrantha Part Four:  

This section discusses the ripening (vipako-udaya) of certain karmas (actions) with a mild (mand) rasa (taste) and their impact on the soul's inherent qualities (svavarya guna). 

It is established that karmas with a mild rasa, even when they ripen, cannot destroy the soul's inherent qualities. This principle is applied to the destruction (kshayopasham) of the karma of "deshghati" (harmful to the country).  Even when the karma of "deshghati" is destroyed, its ripening does not hinder the development of the soul's inherent qualities. 

However, it is crucial to note that during the destruction of "deshghati" karma, which is accompanied by the ripening of other karmas, no karma with a "sarvaghati" (harmful to all) rasa can ripen. This leads to the conclusion that the destruction of "deshghati" karma only occurs when the "sarvaghati" rasa transforms into "deshghati" rasa through pure determination. 

There are 25 types of "patikarma" (counteracting karmas) that are "deshghatini" (harmful to the country). Among these, eight types, including "matijnana-avaran" (veil of knowledge), "shruta-jnana-avaran" (veil of scriptural knowledge), "achakshu-darshan-avaran" (veil of perception), and the five "antaraya" (hindrances), are always being destroyed. This is because the "avarya" (non-inherent) "manishana" (mental) and other "paryaya" (categories) have been continuously destroyed since time immemorial. Therefore, it is understood that only the "deshghati" rasa-sparshak (contact with the harmful rasa) of these eight types of karmas ripens, never the "sarvaghati" rasa-sparshak.

The four types of karmas, "avadhi-jnana-avaran" (veil of clairvoyance), "manah-paryaya-jnana-avaran" (veil of knowledge of mental categories), "chakshu-darshan-avaran" (veil of visual perception), and "bhavadhi-darshan-avaran" (veil of perception of the future), are destroyed occasionally (kadachitka). Their destruction occurs only when their "sarvaghati" rasa-sparshak transforms into "deshghati" rasa. When the "sarvaghati" rasa-sparshak does not ripen, these karmas continue to hinder the soul. The destruction of these four types of karmas should also be understood as being mixed with the ripening of "deshghati" rasa-sparshak.

Apart from these twelve types of karmas, the remaining thirteen types (four "sanjvalana" (agitations) and nine "nokashaya" (hindrances) that belong to the "mohaniya" (delusive) category are "aghra-bodhini" (not easily perceived). When their destruction is accompanied only by the ripening of "deshghati" karma, they do not hinder the soul's inherent qualities and are not considered "deshghatini". However, when their destruction is mixed with the ripening of other karmas, they do hinder the soul's inherent qualities to some extent and are considered "deshghatini".

(b) Twenty types of "ghatikarma" (harmful karmas) are "sarvaghatini" (harmful to all). Among these, only "kevala-jnana-avaran" (veil of omniscience) and "kevala-darshan-avaran" (veil of omniscient perception) are never destroyed. This is because their karmas never become "deshghati" rasa-युक्त (mixed with the harmful rasa) and their ripening cannot be stopped. The remaining eighteen types of karmas can be destroyed. However, it is important to remember that the destruction of these karmas... 

Page #211:
---------------------------
## Chapter 140, Karma Granth Part Four

When the destructive natures (घातिनी प्रकृतियों) are destroyed, there is a manifestation of their results (विपाकोदय). However, when the eighteen all-destructive natures (सर्वघातिनी प्रकृतियों) are destroyed, there is no manifestation of their results. This means that the destruction of these eighteen natures is only possible when their manifestation (प्रदेशोदय) has already occurred. Therefore, it is established that the destruction of natures that manifest their results (वपाकांदयवती प्रकृतियों) is possible, but the destruction of the all-destructive natures (सर्वघातिनी) is not.

Therefore, these eighteen natures are considered to be capable of preventing the manifestation of results (विपाकोदय). This is because their inherent qualities (आवार्य गुणों) are considered to be manifested in the form of their destruction (क्षायोपशमिक स्वरुप में व्यक्त होना माना गया है), which cannot be anything other than the prevention of the manifestation of results (विपाकोदय केनिरोध के सिवाय षट नहीं सकता).

(2) **Upasham (उपशम):** The meaning of the word "Upasham" in the explanation of destruction (क्षयोपशम) is slightly different from the meaning of "Upasham" in the context of "Aupashamik" (औपशमिक). The meaning of "Upasham" in the context of destruction (क्षयोपशम) is simply the absence of the ability to manifest results (विपाकादयसम्बन्धिनी योग्यता का अभाव) or the transformation of intense flavors (तीव्र रस) into mild flavors (मन्द रस). However, the meaning of "Upasham" in the context of "Aupashamik" (औपशमिक) is the absence of both manifestation (प्रदेशोदय) and the manifestation of results (विपाकोदय). This is because the destruction of karma (कर्म का क्षय) continues during destruction (क्षयोपशम), which cannot happen without at least the manifestation (प्रदेशोदय). However, this is not the case with "Upasham" (उपवास). When karma is destroyed (कर्म का उपशम होता है), its destruction stops (उसका क्षय रुक हो जाता है), and therefore there is no need for its manifestation (प्रदेशोदय होने की आवश्यकता ही नहीं रहती). This is why the state of "Upasham" (उपशम अवस्था) is considered to be present only when the karmic particles (दलिकों) that are capable of manifesting in the inner consciousness (अन्तरकरण के अन्तर्मुहूर्त "में उदय पाने के योग्य दलिकों) are either already experienced (कुछ तो पहले ही भोग लिये जाते हैं) or are made capable of manifesting in the future (कुछ बलिक पीछे उदय पाने योग्य बना दिये जाते हैं), meaning that there is an absence of karmic particles that are capable of being experienced (वेद्य- दक्षिकों का अभाव होता है).

Therefore, the concise explanation of destruction (क्षयोपशम) and "Upasham" (उपशम) is that during destruction (क्षयोपशम), there is either the manifestation of results (विपाकोदय) or a mild manifestation of results (मन्द विपाकोदय), but during "Upasham" (उपशम), there is neither. It should be remembered that "Upasham" (उपशम) can only be of the destructive type (घाति का ही हो सकता है), but not of all destructive karmas (सो भी सब धातिकर्म का नहीं), but only of the obscuring karma (किन्तु केवल मोहनीय कर्म का अर्थात् प्रदेश और विपाक दोनों प्रकार का उदय). If the manifestation (प्रदेश) and the manifestation of results (विपाक) can be prevented, then it is only possible for the obscuring karma (मोहनीय कर्म का ही). For this, see Shri Yashvijayji's commentary on the Nandi Sutra (नन्दी, सू० की टीका, पृ० ७७), the commentary on the Karmapadiya (कम्मपयडी, टीका, पृ० १३), the Pancha Dva (पञ्च द्वा० १, गा० २९), and the commentary on the Malayagiri (मलयगिरि व्याख्या). For a detailed discussion of the nature, origin, and differences of Right Conduct (सम्यक्त्व के स्वरूप, उत्पत्ति और भेद-प्रभेदादि का सविस्तार विचार), see the Lok Pra (लोक प्र०-सर्ग ३, श्लोक ५६६-७००).

## Other Killing
Appendix "T". Page 74, line 21 of the word "possible".

Eighteen types of death include the blind vision. Therefore, even in that, the plant life-form should be included. But the question arises that in blind vision, which life-forms are considered insufficient, are they considered blind vision because they have attained full sensory capacity in the insufficient state, or is it blind vision even before attaining full sensory capacity?

If the first view is accepted, then it is correct. Because after attaining full sensory capacity, in the insufficient state, considering the general perception through the four senses, like in the case of visual perception, three insufficient life-forms are mentioned in the 17th verse by way of explanation. Similarly, after attaining full sensory capacity, in the insufficient state, considering the general perception through senses other than sight, seven insufficient life-forms can be deducted from blind vision.

But Shri Jay Somsuri, in his commentary on this verse, has considered blind vision even before attaining full sensory capacity and has included insufficient life-forms in it. And he has explained it based on the principle that in the state of disintegration and karma, a being without visual perception experiences blind vision. The question in this view is, how can blind vision be considered before attaining full sensory capacity, when there is no physical sense organ? This can be answered in two ways.

(1. There are two types of use: use generated by both physical and mental sense organs when there is a physical sense organ, and use generated only by the mental sense organ when there is no physical sense organ. In the state of disintegration and before attaining full sensory capacity, the first type of use cannot occur; but the second type of general use, which is related to perception, can be considered. Accepting this, the commentary on Tattvartha-al 2, Sutra 6 states:

"Because it is independent of the physical sense organ, even for a thief, the person approaching from behind is perceived as distinct, independent of the activity of the physical sense organ." 

Page #213:
---------------------------
142
Karmagrantha, Bhagya, and the four statements are evidence. In summary, the solution can be reached by assuming that the non-visual perception is practical before the completion of sensory attainment.
(2) In Vigrahamat, non-visual perception is considered before the completion of sensory attainment, but it is in the form of power, i.e., in the form of destruction and pacification, not in the form of use. This solution is given based on the commentary of the 46th verse of the ancient fourth Karmagrantha:
"Trayanam apyachakshurvarshanam tasyanaaharakaavasyayaamapi labdhimadhisyaabhyupagamat."
Question: Why is visual perception not considered in the same way as non-visual perception, which is considered to be in the form of use or destruction and pacification before the completion of sensory attainment?
Answer: Visual perception refers to the perception generated by the specific sense organ of the eye. Such perception is considered only when the material eye exists. Therefore, visual perception is considered only after the completion of sensory attainment. Non-visual perception does not refer to the general use of any one sense organ; but it refers to the general use that occurs from a material sense organ other than the eye, from the material mind, or from the material sense organ and material mind + absence, only in the form of destruction and pacification. This is why non-visual perception is considered both before and after the completion of sensory attainment.

Anaharak jivas are of two types: Chashvasth and Vitrag. All Vitrag jivas who are ashariri (liberated) are always Anaharak; however, those who have a heavy body are Anaharak only during the third, fourth, and fifth times of Samudhat. Upastajiva are Anaharak only when they are in the state of Vigrahagati.

To take birth in another life, a jiva has to leave its previous location and go to another location. If the second location is in the Vishreni-Patit (Vatra Rekha) from the first location, then it has to move in a Vakragati. In relation to Vakragati, three things are considered:
11
(1) The number of Vigraha (turns) in Vakragati, (2) The time duration of Vakragati, and (3) The time duration of Anaharaktva in Vakragati.

(1) There are some birth locations that can be attained by taking only one Vigraha. For some locations, two Vigraha are required, and for some, three. No matter how far the new birth location is from the Vishreni-Patit, it can be attained in three Vigraha. There is no difference of opinion in Digambar literature on this subject; because "Vigrahavato Va Sansarinah Prak Chaturbhyah." - Tattvarth A. 2, Sutra 28. In the Sarvarth Siddhi Tika of this Sutra, Shri Pujyapada Swami has mentioned the maximum of three Vigraha movement. Also, "Ekam Dvau Shrivama Harak" - Tattvarth A. 2, Sutra 30. In the 60 Rajbartik of this Sutra, Bhattarak Shri Akal Dev has also supported the maximum of three Vigraha movement. Nemichandra Siddhanta also mentions the same opinion in the 666th verse of Gommatsar Jiva Kanda.

In other texts, there are different opinions on this subject: "Vivati Cha Sansarinah Chaturbhyah" - Tattvarth A. 2, Sutra 22. "Eka Hauva Anaharakah." - Tattvarth A. 2, Sutra 30. In the famous Tattvarth A. 2 commentary of the Vetambar, Bhagwan Umaswati and Shri Siddhasen Ni in his commentary have mentioned the three Vigraha movement. Along with this, the commentary of the said commentary also shows the different opinion of Chaturvigraha movement. This different opinion is mentioned in the 325th verse of Brihatsangrahani and in Shri Bhagwati Shatak 7, Uddesh 1, Sabha Shatak 14, Uddesh 1.

The Karmagrantha mentions four types of motion in its commentary. However, wherever this view is mentioned, it is written that the instruction of the four-fold motion is not found in any original scripture. This suggests that there are very few beings who perform such motion. In the aforementioned scriptures, it is clearly stated that the three-fold motion is not possible.
"Avigraha, Ekavigraha, Dvivigraha, and Trivigraha, these four types of motion are possible, beyond these, no other motion is possible."
From this statement of the commentary and the fact that the Digambara scriptures mostly refer to the three-fold motion, and wherever the view of the four-fold motion is mentioned in the Bhagavati-tika etc., it is shown to be non-existent, therefore, it is more appropriate to consider the three-fold motion as the most accepted view.
(2) Regarding the time duration of the curved motion, the rule is that the time of the curved motion is one more than the number of vigrahas. That is, the time duration of the motion with one vigraha is two times, similarly, the time duration of the Dvivigraha motion is three times, and the time duration of the Trivigraha motion is four times. There is no difference of opinion between the Svetambara and Digambara on this rule. However, according to the view of the four-fold motion mentioned above, the time duration of that motion is stated to be five times. (3) The time duration of the non-eating period in the vigraha motion is considered from two perspectives: practical and definitive. The practicalists believe that during the time of leaving the previous body, which is the first time of the curved motion, some particles suitable for the previous body are taken in through the intake of food. Brihatsangrahani, verse 326 and its commentary; Lokasangraha 3, verse 1107 onwards. However, the definitiveists believe that at the time of leaving the previous body, i.e., the first time of the curved motion, there is no connection with the previous body, nor is a new body formed; therefore, no kind of food is possible at that time. Lokasangraha 3, verse 1115 onwards. Whether practicalists or definitiveists, both agree that the last time of the curved motion, in which the being is born in a new place, definitely involves the intake of food. According to the practical view, the time duration of the non-eating period should be understood as follows:
—
The motion with one vigraha, whose time duration is two times, the being is eating in both times; because in the first time, the previous

**Chapter Four of the Karma Granth: Body-Suitable Lomahar Consumption**

This chapter discusses the duration of the *anahaarak* (non-eating) state during the *lomahaar* (hair-eating) stage of the *sharira-yogya* (body-suitable) diet. It also explores the concept of *anahaarak* in relation to the different types of *vikrah* (separation) and *gati* (motion).

**Two-Vikrah Gati:** This type of motion, which occurs over three periods, has an *anahaarak* state in the middle period.

**Three-Vikrah Gati:** This type of motion, which occurs over four periods, has an *anahaarak* state in the middle two periods, even though it is considered *ahaarak* (eating) in the first and last periods.

**The *Nivasyashti* Perspective:** According to the *Nivasyashti* (certain) perspective, the duration of the *anahaarak* state is equal to the number of *vikrah*. Therefore, in a one-*vikrah* motion, there is one period of *anahaarak*, in a two-*vikrah* motion, there are two periods, and in a three-*vikrah* motion, there are three periods.

**The *Vyavahar* Perspective:** The *Vyavahar* (practical) perspective suggests that the duration of the *anahaarak* state is one period less than the number of *vikrah*. This view is supported by the 31st sutra of the *Tattvarth* chapter 2, its commentary, and the *Tika*. The *Tika* also mentions that according to the *Vyavahar* perspective, there are three periods of *anahaarak* in a five-period *patvikrah* motion.

**Reconciling the Perspectives:** The *Vyavahar* perspective suggests that the *anahaarak* state can only be reduced from three periods to two periods in the case of a four-*vikrah* motion. However, the *Nivasyashti* perspective disagrees with this, stating that the duration of the *anahaarak* state is directly proportional to the number of *vikrah*.

**The Digambara Perspective:** The *Digambara* (sky-clad) tradition, based on the 30th sutra of the *Tattvarth* chapter 2 and its commentaries, supports the *Nivasyashti* perspective.

**The Swetambara Perspective:** The *Swetambara* (white-clad) tradition mentions a four-*vikrah* motion, which, according to the *Nivasyashti* perspective, would result in four periods of *anahaarak*.

**Conclusion:** The differences in the duration of the *anahaarak* state between the *Swetambara* and *Digambara* traditions are based on their respective perspectives, *Vyavahar* and *Nivasyashti*. There is no real contradiction between the two traditions regarding the duration of the *anahaarak* state.

**Important Note:** The abandonment of the previous body, the emergence of the new body, and the motion (whether it is *maj* or *bakri*) all occur simultaneously. The statement that the new body emerges in the second period of the *vikrah* motion is based on the *Vyavahar* perspective. According to this perspective, the last period of the previous body, where the soul is facing the *vikrah* motion, should be considered as the first period of the *vikrah* motion.

## Karmagranth Part Four
Appendix | Page 85, on the word 'Avamivan' in verse 11

There are two main things to know when considering the relationship between Avadhi Darshan and Gunasthan: (1) the different viewpoints and (2) their meaning.

**(1) Different Viewpoints:** There are two main viewpoints in this matter: (a) Karmagranthic and (b) Siddhantic.

**(a) Karmagranthic Viewpoint:** This viewpoint is also divided into two. The first viewpoint considers Avadhi Darshan to be present in the fourth to ninth Gunasthanas. This viewpoint is mentioned in the 26th verse of the ancient fourth Karmagranth, which considers those who have ignorance in the first three Gunasthanas to not have Avadhi Darshan in any of the ten Gunasthanas. This viewpoint is further mentioned in the 48th verse and the 70th and 71st verses of the ancient fourth Karmagranth, which are accepted by those Karmagranthic thinkers who consider Asham to be present until the second Gunasthan. Both these viewpoints are found in the 690th and 704th verses of Gommatsar Jivakalan. The first viewpoint is also found in the Sarvarth Siddhi of the Tatvasarth-A. 1, which states: "Mashivarshane Asanyatasampashtigani Bichkavayamsami."

**(b) Siddhantic Viewpoint:** This viewpoint is completely different. It considers Avadhi Darshan to be present in the first twelve Gunasthanas. This is known from the Bhagavati Sutra. Shri Malayagiri Suri has clearly shown this viewpoint in the commentary of the 35th verse of Panchasangrah-Bar 1 and in the commentary of the 29th verse of the ancient fourth Karmagranth.

"Mohisanasanagaropaanalagam Bhanta. Ki nami mamani? Goyama! Gani vi mamapi FRI ja nani te asgama tinnaano, asthagahima bajgani. Me tignaachi, te pabhibhivohiyanani suyagani ohinani. Me parnaagi te maminiyohimammano mupagagi ohinami magpagjavashani. Ne apani he piyama mahamaanagi muyambani vimanganani."

Bhagavati-Shatak 8, Uddesh 2.

**(2) Meaning:** (of the above viewpoints) 

Page #218:
---------------------------
## Karmagrantha Bhava Char 9

**(a)** Both types of Karmagranthic scholars, those who believe in ignorance in the first three Gunasthanas and those who believe in ignorance in the first two Gunasthanas, differentiate between Avadhijnana and Avadhidarshan through Avadhijnana, but not through Vibhangashana. They say that the specific use of Avadhi is different from the general use of Avadhi. Therefore, just as in a Samyaktvi who has Avadhi-upayoga, Avadhijnana and Avadhidarshan are both separate, similarly in an ignorant person who has Avadhi-upayoga, Vibhangajnana and Avadhidarshan are both truly different. However, there is only a lack of desire to differentiate between Vibhangajnana and Avadhidarshan. The lack of desire to differentiate is simply their commonality. That is, just as Vibhangajnana cannot determine the true nature of the object, similarly Avadhidarshan, being general in nature, cannot determine the nature of the object.

Due to this lack of desire to differentiate, according to the first opinion, Avadhidarshan should be understood in the fourth to ninth Gunasthanas, and according to the second opinion, it should be understood in the third to ninth Gunasthanas.

**(b)** Saiddhantic scholars desire to differentiate between Vibhangajnana and Avadhidarshan, not to unify them. This is why they believe in Vibhangashana. According to them, Vibhangajnana is only possible in the first Gunasthana, not in the second or subsequent ones. Therefore, they believe in Avadhidarshan in the first twelve Gunasthanas, considering it to be associated with Avadhijnana in the second to eleventh Gunasthanas and with Vibhangajnana in the first Gunasthana. The formlessness in the vision of an Avadhijnani and a Vibhangashani is the same. Therefore, instead of giving a separate name like 'Vibhangadarshan' to the vision of a Vibhangashani, it is called 'Avadhidarshan'.

**Summary:** The Karmagranthic side does not desire to differentiate between Vibhangajnana and Avadhidarshan, while the Saiddhantic side does.

— Lokaprakash Sarg 3, Shlok 1057 onwards. This difference of opinion has been mentioned by Shri Jinabhadragani Kshamasraman in the Visheshnavati Granth, which is mentioned in Prajnapanapad 18, Vritti Pu. (Kolkata) 566.

Appendix "D" of the Karmagrantha, Part 12. Page 86, Line 2.  Consideration of the word 'Aharaka' in relation to the diet of a Kevalajnani.  The Angokara of Aharakatva at the time of the 13th Gunasthan is the same in the Digambara texts as here. - Tattvartha - 1, Sutra 8, Sarvarthasiddhi. "Maharanuvatem Aharapheshumi Gyaiishtipvanisayogakevalyanthani"
The Mommatsar-Kaidi... Bhorigaatha is also worth looking at for this.
In the aforementioned Gunasthan, the rise of Asatvedaniya is also accepted in the texts of both sects (Second Karmagrantha, Ga. 22: Karmakanda, Ga. 271).  Similarly, at that time, in the absence of the term Aharasanjna, the rise of Audarik-sharira-namakarma from the rise of Karmapudgalas, like the rise of Audarik-sharira-namakarma from the rise of Karmapudgalas, is also accepted in the Digambara texts (Labdhisar Ma 614).  The explanation of Aharakatva in Gommatsar is so clear that there is no doubt about the acceptance of Audarik, Bhasha and Manovargna Pudgalas by the Kevali (Jiv. Ga. 663-664).  The continuous acceptance of Audarik Pudgalas is also a type of Ahar, which is called 'Lo Mahara'.  For this Ahar, the sustenance of the body is known, and in its absence, the acceptance of Audarik Pudgalas until the Yoga-pravritti is proven by other means.  In this way, Aharakatva in a Kevalajnani, its cause, the rise of Asatvedaniya, and the acceptance of Audarik Pudgalas, are accepted by both sects in the same way.  This agreement of thought between the two sects is so great that the question of Kabalaahar is automatically resolved in the eyes of the wise.
Those who believe that Kevalajnanis do not accept Kabalaahar, also agree that they accept other subtle Audarik Pudgalas.  Those who believe that Kevalajnanis accept Kabalaahar, believe that they are nothing but gross Audarik Pudgalas.  Thus, both those who believe and those who do not believe in Kabalaahar agree that Kevalajnanis accept some kind of Audarik Pudgalas.  In such a situation, making the question of Kabalaahar a point of contention is meaningless.

Appendix "" | Page 66, Line 20 'Nationalism' Gyaper [The prohibition of reading the twelfth chapter called 'Striko Drishtivav' is under consideration.]
[Equality:- Both practice and scriptures prove that women are equal to men in both physical and spiritual development. Kumari Tarabai's not being less than Professor Rammoorti in the physical realm, the learned Annie Besant's thoughts and spiritual power not being less than any other male thinker or speaker, and the learned Sarojini Naidu's poetic power not being less than any famous male poet, are proof that women can achieve the same abilities as men if given equal resources and opportunities. The Shvetambar Acharyas have considered women equal to men in ability and have given them the right to Kaivalya and Moksha, meaning complete physical and spiritual development. For this, see Prajnapana-Su. 7, p. 18; Nandi-Su. 21, p. 130/11.
They have written a lot about the Digambar Acharyas who disagree on this matter. For this, see Nandi-Tika, p. 131/1-133/1; Prajnapana-Tika, 20-22/1; P. Shastravasimuccaya-Tika, p. 425-430.
_ The eloquent scholar Rajokhar has shown, with a sense of mediation, that women are equal to men,
"Even women can be poets like men. Culture within oneself is not dependent on gender, nor does heroism require division. In the past, queens, daughters of great ministers, courtesans, curious wives, and scholars who fought in debates, were all poets."
-Kavya Mimamsa-Chapter 10. Opposition:- The prohibition of women studying Drishtivad comes from two perspectives: (1) From the perspective of logic and (2) From the limitations set by scriptures.
(1!- On one hand, women are considered worthy of knowledge and Moksha, and on the other hand, they are considered unfit for studying Drishtivad, for fear of losing their knowledge. This seems contradictory, like giving someone a jewel and then saying that they cannot protect a cowrie shell. 

Page #221:
---------------------------
150/
**Chapter Four (2) of the Karma Granth -**  Prohibiting the study of Drishtivad also hinders the limits of the cause-and-effect relationship as stated in the scriptures. For example, one cannot attain Kevalgyan without first attaining the five senses; the first two stages of Shulkadhyan cannot be attained without prior knowledge, and 'prior' is a part of Drishtivad. This limit is undeniably accepted in the scriptures.
"Shulkayavah Purvavidah."
Tattvarth, Chapter 6, Sutra 36. Therefore, considering a woman ineligible for Drishtivad as eligible for Kevalgyan seems clearly contradictory.

There are two perspectives regarding the reasons for the ineligibility of women for Drishtivad:

(a) The first perspective, held by Shri Jinbhadramani Kshamasraman and others, attributes this ineligibility to mental flaws like triviality, pride, sensory fickleness, and reliance on opinions. For this, see Vishesh Bhashya, 552nd verse.

(b) The second perspective, held by Shri Bhadrasuri and others, attributes this ineligibility to physical flaws in the form of impurities. Thus:
"Katham Dwadashangapratisheshah? Tathavishaviprataso Dovat." Lalitavistara, Chapter [Removal of Contradiction from Nayashti]: The special cause-and-effect relationship that appears in the attainment of Kevalgyan by a woman due to her ineligibility for Drishtivad is not actually a contradiction. Because the scriptures consider women capable of understanding the meaning of Drishtivad; the prohibition is only for verbal study.
"Shrenipatih Tu Kamagarbhavadbhavatobhavo'ddhi Evam."
- Ativishtara and its commentary by Shrimunichandrasuri, Chapter 111. When tapas, contemplation, etc., lead to a significant reduction and cessation of the knowledge-obscuring karmas, a woman can understand the complete meaning of Drishtivad without verbal study and, by attaining the two stages of Shulkadhyan, can also attain Kevalgyan. "Yadicha 'Shastrayogagamyasamayyam Yogaha Vaseya Madhatisukhsmen Vishishtakhsayopashamaprabhamaprabhadiyogata Purvadharasyaiva Bovatarikesadbhava" 

Page #222:
---------------------------
"Karmagrantha" Part Four, "Danashulkadhyan" has been received. There is no fault in attaining liberation through the attainment of Kevala Jnana. Even without the intervention of an "Apayana", the "Bhavat" is "Purvavittva" in essence. This is explained in detail. Then, there is no fault in the "Vissayasamcha" of the "Nigranthi"s.
- Shastrava 426. - There is no rule that one cannot understand the meaning without studying from the Guru's mouth. Many people are seen who, without studying from anyone, acquire deep knowledge of their desired subject through contemplation and reflection.
Now, regarding the prohibition of verbal study, many arguments arise. Is it appropriate to declare someone who is considered capable of understanding the meaning as unfit for verbal study? Words are merely a means of understanding the meaning. It is not appropriate to say that someone who can acquire knowledge of the meaning through other means like penance, meditation, etc., is unfit to acquire that knowledge through words. The mental defects like arrogance, etc., which are shown as the reason for the prohibition of studying the "Sharira", are they not present in men? If verbal study is not prohibited for men in general because of the absence of these defects in specific men, then is it not possible for specific women who are equal to men? If it were impossible, then why is the liberation of women described? The possibility of physical defects for studying the "Sharira" is also not applicable to all women. If it applies to some women, then is there not a possibility of physical impurity in some men? In such a situation, is the prohibition of verbal study for women, excluding men, done with this intention? In this regard, it is only necessary to say that the prohibition of verbal study by showing mental or physical defects seems to be a practical matter, not a prohibition of study for specific women. In support of this, it can be said that when specific women are capable of understanding the meaning of "Dristi-vad", "Ditaragamav", "Kevalajnana" and attaining liberation, then what is the possibility of mental defects in them? And how can physical impurity be attributed to women who are virtuous, attentive and have the highest pure conduct? Even men who are considered fit for studying "Dristi-vad", like: "Sthulbhadra", "Dubanlika", "Pushyamitra", etc., could not protect "Dristi-vad" due to reasons like "Numchhatva", memory defects, etc.

**Karma-Rampu, Part Four**

"Teg Chitiyam Bhoganonam Dis Varisse Mitti Sihurusham Mumbai."
- Aavashyak Vritti, p. 0668/1. "Sato Sharipari Duliyapoorsamitto Ham Sayanario Dinno, Tato So Kayavi Vivase Vaynan Damana Ayariyamuvaditi Bhagimmam Bayanan Vetass Nasati, Manch Sannayaghare Nanurahiy, Ato Mam Arantasss Navam Pugvam Nasiihit, Tahe Aapariya Chiti-Jai Tak Eyaras Parmahavisss Evam Sarantasss Nasah Annass Miran Vesha."
Aavashyamfavatti, 10308.

Even though the situation is like this, why are women prohibited from studying? This question can be answered in two ways: (1) Even if the material is available, women are less qualified than men, and (2) Historical circumstances.

(1) In Western countries where women have access to education equal to men, history shows that women can be equal to men. However, the number of qualified individuals is higher in the male population than in the female population.

(2) Digambara Acharyas like Kudakunda Acharya declared women unfit for even initiation due to their physical and mental shortcomings.

"Singammi Yarponam, Panatare Pahika Khadesam. Magio Suhamo Kano, Tasam Kah Ho Payajma."
Shatpahu-Sutrappahrist Ga. 24-25. Vedic scholars, giving priority to physical purity, declared women and Shudra castes generally unqualified for study: "Stree Shuko Naapiyarata."

These opposing sects had such an impact that even while acknowledging the capability of women equal to men, the Vetambara Acharyas started declaring them unfit for study without any fault.

## Karmagrantha Part Four
### 153

Even though the right to read the eleven Angas is accepted, the reason for the prohibition of the twelfth Anga also suggests that the view of the "Dristivada" remained important in practice. At that time, especially, the importance of the Vedas and other scriptures was understood in terms of physical purity. Therefore, it is natural to imitate the practices of other large neighboring societies to maintain its importance from a practical perspective. For this reason, even though the Acharyas considered women fully qualified from a spiritual perspective, they declared them ineligible for literal study, considering their physical impurity from a practical perspective.

Lord Gautama Buddha had declared women ineligible for the Bhikshu (monk) position, but Lord Mahavira had from the beginning established them as equal to men in their right to the Bhikshu position. This is why the four-fold Sangha (community) was established from the beginning in Jainism, and the number of Sadhvis (female monks) and Shravikas (female lay followers) has always been greater than that of Sadhus (male monks) and Shravakas (male lay followers). However, when Lord Buddha granted the Bhikshu position to women at the insistence of his chief disciple, Ananda, their number gradually increased, and after a few centuries, due to various reasons like illiteracy, mismanagement, and others, there was a significant decline in their conduct, which led to the Buddhist community being considered corrupted in a way. It is possible that this situation had some impact on the Jain community, leading to the Digambara Acharyas declaring women ineligible for the Bhikshu position altogether. The Svetambara Acharyas, on the other hand, maintained the high status of women, but they also highlighted weaknesses, fickleness of senses, and other flaws that were particularly prevalent in that gender. This is because it is inevitable that the practices of neighboring communities influence each other.

**Karmagranth Part Four Appendix "Th" - Text 101, Line 12**

"In the context of Chakshudarshan, thirteen Yogas are mentioned, but Shri Malayagiriji has mentioned eleven Yogas. He has excluded four Yogas: Karman, Audarikvamitra, Vaikriyabhisn, and Aharakamidh.

**Commentary on the 12th verse of Pascha 1.** The implication of accepting eleven Yogas is that in the state of Aparita (incomplete), Chakshudarshan does not occur, and in that state, Karman and Audarikvamitra, these two Yogas, which are associated with the state of Aparita, do not exist. Similarly, when Kriyamitra or Aharakamisn-Kayayoga exists, until the Vaikriyasharira or Aharakasharira is complete, Chakshudarshan does not occur. Therefore, Vaikriyabhisn and Aharakamidh-Yoga should not be considered in that state.

**Doubt:** A doubt may arise that if Chakshudarshan is accepted in the state of Aparita, after the Indrimaprapti becomes complete, according to the alternative view mentioned in the 17th verse, then how can the absence of Audarikvamitra-Kayayoga, which is associated with the state of Aparita, be considered?

**Resolution:** In Panchamangraha, there is an alternative view that states that the Midh-Yoga should be considered only when the body is not fully complete in the state of Aparita, and not after it becomes complete. **Commentary on the 7th verse of Panchdva 1.** According to this view, when Chakshudarshan occurs in the state of Aparita, the exclusion of Audarikvamitra-Kayayoga from Chakshudarshan due to the absence of Misrayoga is not contradictory.

**In this context, thirteen Yogas are considered in Manahparyaya Jnana, which includes Aharak-Dvik. However, Gommatsar-Karmakanda does not accept this. Because, it states that during the time of Pariharavishuddha Charitra and Manahparyaya Jnana, the Aharakasharira and the Aharaka-Angopaanganama Karma do not arise... Karmakanda verse 324.** Until the Aharaka-Dvik arises, the Aharakasharira cannot be formed, and except for its formation, the two Yogas, Aharakamisn and Aharak, are not possible. This proves that Gommatsar does not accept the two Aharak Yogas in Manahparyaya Jnana. This view is also supported by the 728th verse of Jivakanda. Its meaning is that when any one of these states - Manahparyaya Jnana, Pariharavishuddha Samyama, Prathamoshamsamyak Jnana, and Aharak-Dvik - is attained, the remaining states are not attained.

Appendix "6".  Pu. 104, line 'Kevalisamudhat' word [Some thoughts on the relationship of Felisamudhat:]
(a) Before creating the future action-Kevalisamudhat, a special action is performed, which is in the form of auspicious yoga, whose state is the inner moment proof and whose function is to deposit the karma-dala in the udayalika. This special action is called 'Amojikaakaran'. Because it is done by the soul that is directed (inclined) towards liberation, it is called 'Avabhitakaran'. And because it is necessarily done by all Kevalajnani, it is also called 'Avaspakakaran'. In the Svetambar literature, all three names, Amojikaakaran etc., are famous. - Bishe. A., Ga. 3050, 55; and Pancha Dwa. 1. Ga. 16 commentary.
In Digambar literature, only the name 'Avabhitakaran' is famous. The characteristic is also clear in it

## Chapter 154: The Karma Granth, Part Four

The **karma granth** is fourteen **rajjus** in length, but its thickness is only equal to the **sharira**. In the second stage, the **danda** is stretched east-west or north-south, and its shape is made like a **kapaata** (door). In the third stage, the **kapaata** is shaped like a **manyaa** (mortar), meaning it is stretched east-west and north-south on both sides, making it resemble a **rai** (churning stick). In the fourth stage, the empty spaces in the **vidishaas** are filled with **aaram** regions, and the entire **loka** is encompassed. In the fifth stage, the **loka**-encompassing regions of the **aatma** are again shaped like a **manyaa** through the **saharan** process. In the sixth stage, the **manyaa** shape is transformed into a **kapaata** shape. In the seventh stage, the **aatma** regions are again made into **danda** form, and in the eighth stage, they are placed in their original position - within the **sharira**.

(c) According to the **Jain** perspective, the **aatma**'s pervasiveness is described in texts like the **Sangati**, **Upanishads**, and **Bhagavad Gita**. "**Vishvachasurat Vishvato Mulo Vishvato Bahut Vishvatasya**" - **Shwetaashvatara Upanishad** 3-3, 11-15.

"**Sarvata Panipadam Tat Sarvato'bhimukham. Sarvata Shrutimalloke Sarvam Avritya Tishthati**" - **Bhagavad Gita**, 13-13.

According to the **Jain** perspective, this description is **arthavaad**, meaning it is indicative of the **aatma**'s greatness and praise. The basis of this **arthavaad** is the **aatma** becoming **loka**-encompassing in the fourth stage of **kevalimudhaat**. This point has been stated by **Upadhyaya Shri Yashvijayji** on page 335 of **Shastra Vaarta Samuccaya**.

Just as the **samudhaat** process is considered for quickly experiencing **vedaniya** and other **karmas**, similarly, in **Patanjali Yoga Darshan**, it is considered as **bahukaya nirman kriya**, which is performed by a **tvasaakshaatkarta** yogi to quickly experience **sopkram** **karma**. - **Paad** 3, **Sutra** 22's commentary and **vritti**; **Paad** 4, **Sutra** 4's commentary and **vritti**.

**On the word 'Kal' in line 18 of verse 10.117:**

There have been two opposing viewpoints regarding 'Kal' (time) in both Jain and Vedic philosophies for almost 2500 years. Both viewpoints are described in Shwetambar texts, while Digambar texts only present one viewpoint.

**(1) The first viewpoint does not consider 'Kal' as an independent substance. It believes that 'Kal' is the continuous flow of Jiva (soul) and Ajiva (non-soul) substances. According to this viewpoint, the continuous transformation of Jiva and Ajiva is considered 'Kal' in a figurative sense. Therefore, in reality, Jiva and Ajiva should be considered as 'Kal' substance, and it is not a separate entity. This viewpoint is found in 'Jee Gaabhin' and other texts.**

Later texts like Tattvarth Sutra by Umaswati, Trishika by Shri Siddhasena Divakara, Visheshavashak Madhyam by Shri Jinabhadragani Samashraman, Dharmasangrahani by Shri Haribhadra Suri, Yogashastra by Shri Hemchandra Suri, Dravya-Guna-Paryaya ke Ras by Shri Upadhyay Prashovijayji, Lokaprakash by Shri Vinayvijayji, Nayachakraasar and Agamsaar by Shri Devchandraji have mentioned both these viewpoints from the Agamas. The Digambar sect only accepts the second viewpoint, which was first found in the texts of Bhikku Kundakunda Acharya. Later, Pujyapada Swami, Bhattarak Shri Akal Dev, Vidyānanda Swami, Nemichandra Siddhantachkravarti, and Banarasi Das, etc., have also mentioned this viewpoint.

**The meaning of the first viewpoint:** The first viewpoint states that the terms like 'Samay' (time), 'Avalika' (duration), 'Muit' (moment), 'Din-Rat' (day-night), etc., which are considered as 'Kal' in practical life, or the states like 'Navin' (new), 'Nata' (young), 'Pugnata' (mature), 'Jostata' (old), 'Kanishthata' (younger), etc., which are considered as 'Kal' in practical life, are all just indications of specific actions (Paryaya-vishesh). For example, the Paryaya of Jiva and Ajiva, which is indivisible, i.e., even intellect cannot divide it into two parts, that ultimate, extremely subtle Paryaya is called 'Samay'.

They say, countless **Paryaya** bundles are called **Bhavalika**. Many **Balika** are called **Murhut** and thirty **Murhut** are called a day and night. Of the two **Paryayas**, the one that happened earlier is called **Puran** and the one that happened later is called **Navin**. Of the two living beings, the one born later is called **Kanishth** and the one born earlier is called **Jyeshth**. Considering this, it becomes clear that time, **Avalika**, etc., all are **Vyavahar** and **Navinata**, etc., all are **Mantravashta** states, which are merely indications of specific types of **Prayayas**, i.e., **Nivigha** **Paryaya** and their small and large groups conceived by the mind. **Paryaya** is what the living and non-living beings do, which happens without the influence of any other element. That is, both living and non-living beings, in their own **Garbhavarup**, are **A.P** themselves. In reality, one should call the **Paryaya** bundle of living and non-living beings as **Kal**. **Kal** is not an independent substance.

## 158

**The other side's argument:** Just as **Dharma-Astikaya** elements are considered as **Vibhinna-Karan** for the movement and stillness of living beings and **Pudgala**, even though they have the nature to move and be still, similarly, **Kal-Dravya** should be considered as **Nimitta-Karan** for the **Paryaya** transformation of living and non-living beings, even though they have the nature to transform. If **Kal** is not considered as **Nimitta-Karan**, then there is no logic in considering **Dharma-Astikaya** and **Adharma-Astikaya**.

**Difference of opinion on the other side:** There are two opinions among those who consider **Kal** as an independent substance regarding its nature.

**(1)** **Kal-Dravya** exists in the **Manushya-Kshetra** only, in the field of motion of the astrological cycle. It becomes the cause of changes in the entire universe, even though it is a part of the **Manushya-Kshetra**. **Kal** helps the astrological cycle in its motion. Therefore, it is appropriate to consider **Kal-Dravya** as limited to the **Manushya-Kshetra** only, as it does not exist outside of it. This opinion is found in the **Dharmagrahani**, etc., **Shwetamber** sects.

## Karmagrantha Part Four, Chapter 156 (2)

**Time-substance is not merely a human-realm, but what is it?** It pervades the universe, but unlike the dharma-astikaya, it is not a skandha (aggregate). It is atomic in nature. The number of its atoms is equal to the number of regions in the loka-akasha (universe). These atoms, being motionless, remain everywhere, in every region of the loka-akasha. They do not form any skandha. Therefore, they do not have the power to move laterally (tiryak prachay). This is why time-substance is not considered an astikaya. 

**Despite the absence of lateral movement, there is vertical movement (urdhava prachay).** This leads to continuous permutations (paryaya) within each time-atom. These permutations are called 'time'. One should understand that each time-atom has infinite time permutations. These time permutations are the cause of permutations in other substances. All states like newness-oldness, seniority-juniority, etc., should be understood as a result of the flow of time within the time-atom. 

**The time it takes for a pudgala-atom to move from one region of the loka-akasha to another at a slow pace, is the time it takes for one time-permutation of the time-atom to occur.** In other words, the magnitude of a time-permutation is equal to the magnitude of the slow movement of an atom from one region to another. This is the view of the Digambara sect.

**What is the actual situation?** From the perspective of certain knowledge (nishcaya drishti), there is no need to consider time as a separate substance. By considering it as a permutation of the jiva (soul), all actions and behaviors are explained. Therefore, this view is the true one (taatvika), while the other views are practical (vyavaharika) and conventional (aupcharic).

**The view of considering time as a human-realm is based on the gross worldly experience.** The view of considering it atomic is conventional. If this is not accepted, then the question arises: If newness, oldness, etc., exist even outside the human realm, then how can time be considered only within the human realm? Secondly, what is the logic in believing that time depends on the movement of the celestial wheel (jyotish chakra)? Even if it does depend on it, can it not, being all-pervasive, utilize the movement of the celestial wheel? Therefore, the idea of considering time as a human-realm is based on gross worldly experience. The idea of considering it atomic is conventional. 

**Each pudgala-atom, through its own process...**

## Translation:

**160**

Kala (time) should be considered as Ramjhana (a relative concept) and Kala-shuke (time-atom) should be considered as Apradeshtva (non-existent).

**Chapter Four, Karma Granth**

**Consistency of the Statement:**

If Kala (time) is not considered as Ramjhana (a relative concept) and is considered as a separate entity, then the question arises: If Kala (time) is considered as a separate entity, then why is it not considered as a Skandha (constituent) like Dharma-Astikaya (the body of Dharma)?

Apart from this, there is another question: In the Jiva-Ajiva (soul-non-soul) category, the cause of the time-category is Nimitta-Karan (the cause of creation). But what is the cause of the time-category? If it is natural and does not require any other cause, then why should the Jiva-Ajiva (soul-non-soul) category be considered natural? If we assume another cause for the Ramya-category (category of pleasure), then it leads to Anvastha (infinite regress). Therefore, it is appropriate to consider the Anu-Paksha (atomic theory) as a formal concept.

**The Nature of Kala (time) in Vedic Philosophy:**

There are two main viewpoints regarding Kala (time) in Vedic philosophies. The Vaisheshika Darshan (philosophy) - A. 2. 0. 2, Sutra 6-10, and Nyaya Darshan (philosophy) consider Kala (time) as an all-pervasive, independent entity. Sankhya - A. 2, Sutra 12, Yoga, and Vedanta philosophies do not consider Kala (time) as an independent entity, but consider it as a form of Prakriti-Purusha (matter-consciousness). This second viewpoint is based on Nishcaya-Drishti (absolute knowledge) and the first viewpoint is based on Vyavahar (practical knowledge).

**Jain Philosophy:**

In Jain philosophy, what is called 'Samaya' (time) and in other philosophies is called 'Kshan' (moment), is not a separate entity called 'Kala' (time). It is merely a concept created by worldly beings for the sake of practical life, regarding the sequence of moments. To understand this clearly, one should refer to Yoga Darshan, Pa. 3. 0. 520, Bhashya (commentary). The view on Kala (time) in the said commentary is based on Nishcaya-Drishti (absolute knowledge) and therefore appears to be the true nature of Kala (time).

**Scientific Consensus:**

Currently, science is moving towards the direction of the theory of relativity. Therefore, we should also consider the views on Kala (time) according to this perspective. Scientists also consider Kala (time) as a hypothetical concept like direction, not real.

**Conclusion:**

Considering all aspects, it is certain that there is no evidence to support the view that Kala (time) is a separate, independent entity.

**Meaning:**

All Jeevasthaanas are in the Mithyaatvaguna Sthaan. There are five Aaparyaapta in Saasavaan. They are: Ekaindriya, Dvaindriya, Triindriya, Chaturindriya and Asajji-Panchendriya. There are also two Sanjnee. Aapati and Paryapta, making a total of seven Jeevasthaanas. In the Aviraat Samyagdrishti Guna Sthaan, there are both Sajji (Aaparyaapta and Paryapta) Jeevasthaanas. Except for the above mentioned, in the remaining eleven Guna Sthaanas, there are only Paryapta Sanjnee Jeevasthaanas. || 45 ||

**Note:**

1. The Jeevasthaanas or the thoughts mentioned here in the Guna Sthaan are different from those mentioned in Gommatsaar. In Gommatsaar, the Aaparyaapta Sanjnee are considered as two Jeevasthaanas in the second, sixth and thirteenth Guna Sthaanas. - Jeevo, Ga. 668.

This description in Gommatsaar is relative. In the 113th verse of Karmakaand, the Aaparyaapta Ekaindriya, Dvaindriya etc. are considered as the owners of the second Ganasthaan and they are called as the owners of only the first Guna Sthaan in Jeevaad. This is because of the scarcity of the Aaparyaapta Ekaindriya etc. Jeevas in the second Ganasthaan. The owner of the sixth Guna Sthaan is called Aaparyaapta because of the Aahaarakamishnakaya Yoga. - Jeeva Kaand, Ga. 126.

The owner of the thirteenth Guna Sthaan, the Mayogi, is called Aaparyaapta because of the incompleteness of his Yoga. - Jeeva Kaand, Ga. 125.

Language - All types of worldly beings, from Ekendriyadi, are to be understood. Therefore, in the first Gunasthan, all Jivastahan have been mentioned.
In the second Gunasthan, the seven Jivastahan mentioned above are mentioned, of which six are insufficient, which should be understood as all Karan-insufficient, because Lavidh-insufficient Jiva are already in the first Gunasthan.
In the fourth Gunasthan, insufficient Sanji have been mentioned, which should also be understood as Karan-insufficient from the above mentioned.
Except for the sufficient Sanji, no other type of Jiva has such results that they can attain the remaining eleven Gunasthan, leaving the first, second and fourth. Therefore, only the sufficient Sanji Jivastahan is considered in these eleven Gunasthan. || 45 ||

**Miśchātvavikāyate Yogā, Āhārakadvikōna Apūrvapanchake Tu.**
**Manāvac Audārikam Sarvakrim Miśre Sarvakidvik Daśe.** || 46 ||

**Meaning:**

There are thirteen yogas in Miśchātv, Sāsāyana and Aviratsamyāṣṭiguna sthāna, excluding Āhārak-dik. From Apūrvakaraṇa to the fifth guna sthāna, there are four yogas of mind, four yogas of speech and one Audārik, making a total of nine yogas. In Miśragana sthāna, there are the aforementioned nine yogas plus one Vaiśyi, making a total of ten yogas. In Deśaviratgana sthāna, there are the aforementioned nine yogas plus Vaikip-dvik, making a total of eleven yogas. || 46 ||

**Bhavartha:**

In the first, second and fourth guna sthāna, there are thirteen yogas as follows: Kārmṇayāṁga, Vigrahagatimiṁ and in the first time of birth; Paniyamin and Śaucārikamiśch, these two yogas are in the first time of birth, after the insufficient state and Pār Bhaṁ, four yogas of speech, one Mōvārik and one Ve Kriya, these ten yogas are in the sufficient state. Āhārak and Āhārakamiśch, these two yogas are not in these three guna sthāna because they are related to the conduct.

**Note:**

The discussion about yogas in guna sthāna is similar to what is found in Pañcasamgraha, Dvā. 1, Gā. 16-18 and Prācīna Caturdha Karma Grantha, Gā. 66-66.

There are some differences in Gommatasāra. It mentions nine yogas in the first seven guna sthāna and eleven yogas in the sixth guna sthāna. Jī. Gā. 703.

Karmagranth Part Four
The state of *matt* is present. Therefore, in the thirteen *yogas* of the sixth *ganasthan*, except for the aforementioned two *yonis*, the *mar* disease is present: upon forming a *bainkriya* body or *aaharaka* body, the state of *apramatt* is also possible. Therefore, the *yogas* of the *apramatt* *ganasthan* include *bainkriyayoga* and *aaharakakayayoga*.
For the *sayogikevalo*, at the time of *kevalisamudghāt*, *kāmaṇ* and *audārikamiśna*, these are the *mogas*, at all other times, *aucharikkayayoga*, *anupsaravimānavāsī* etc., at the time of answering questions from the mind, *mano* *yoga*, and at the time of giving *deshna*, there are two *prachan* *yogas*. From this, seven *yogas* are present in the thirteenth *ganasthan*.
The *kevali* *bhagavan* attains the state of *ayogi* by eliminating all *yogas*. Therefore, there is an absence of *yogas* in the fourteenth *ganasthan*. ||47||

**(3) - Uses in the Gunasthans**

**"Tiranaranadudansahm, duge ajad besi natan te mosi misa samana, jayai kevalad ange."** || 48 ||

**"Vijnana dridarshamadimadhikaye'yate dese shanadarshanatrikam. Te misra misraah samanama yattadishu kevaladvikamantashtrike."** || 48 ||

**Meaning:**

In the Gunasthans of Madhyatva and Sasavan, there are five uses: three types of Ajnana (ignorance) and two types of Darshan (vision). In the Gunasthans of Aviraatasabhya Drishti and Veshavithi, there are six uses: three types of Jnana (knowledge) and three types of Darshan. In the Misra Gunasthan, there are six uses: three types of Jnana and three types of Darshan, but the Jnana is mixed and the Ajnana is mixed. From the Gunasthan of Pramattasanyata to the Gunasthan of Kshina Mohaniya, there are seven uses: the aforementioned six and Manas Paryaya Jnana. In the Gunasthans of Sayogikevali and Ayogikevali, there are two uses: Keval Jnana and Kambal Darshan. || 48 ||

**Meaning:**

In the first and second Gunasthans, there is an absence of Samyak (right conduct). Therefore, the seven uses of Samyaktva's companions - five types of Jnana, Avashisharan, and Keval Darshan - are not present. The remaining five uses are present.

In the fourth and fifth Gunasthans, there is no Mithyatva (false belief), so the three types of Ajnana are not present. There is no Sarvavithi (omniscience), so Manas Paryaya Jnana and Ghatikarma are not present. There is no Keval Vik, so a total of six uses are not present. The remaining six uses are present.

**Note:**

This topic is discussed in Pancha Sangrah, Chapter 2, verses 16-20; Prachin Chaturth Karma Granth, verses 70-71; and Gommatasar - Jivakand, verse 704.

'In the first 'Sare Gaye' there are two 'Don' and ten 'Dashang', these are the main uses. But 'Ishtti', 'Pashchit' and 'Ashuddha' are of dual nature, knowing this, 'Anan-Mishrit' is used.
From the sixth to the twelfth, in the seven 'Gunasthanas', 'Miwat' is not the cause due to 'Agnan-Trika' and due to the non-destruction of 'Tikarma', 'Kshetrasna-Hika' is not present. In this way, leaving 'Pani', the remaining 'Mat' uses should be understood in them.
In the thirteenth and fourteenth 'Ganasthanas', due to the absence of 'Ghanikarma', 'Chhamstasthava-Mavo' and 'Dam' uses are not present. Only 'Kshetralaman' and 'Kevalavarshan', these are the only uses, 1148t

Meaning- There seems to be a difference of opinion between the 'Siddhant' and the 'Farmgranya' on some topics. Out of these, the author has shown three topics in this 'Gatha':

## Karmagrantha Part Four

**(a)** In the second Gunasthan, the Sisams' consider knowledge of Mati, Shruta, etc. to be present, not absent. Conversely, in Karmapannya, ignorance is considered to be present, not absent. The principle's intention is that although the living being in the second Gunasthan is in front of Mithyatva, it is not Mithyatvi; due to the presence of a part of Samyaktva, there is some purity. Therefore, its knowledge should be considered as knowledge. The intention of Karmagrantha is that the living being in the second Gunasthan is not Mithyatvi, but it is facing Mithyatva. Therefore, its result has more impurities. Therefore, its knowledge should be considered as ignorance.

1. In Bhagavati, the Indriyas are also called knowledgeable. This statement proves that the Siddhanta calls the Indriyas knowledgeable only by considering knowledge in the Sasadan state. Because they lack all other Gunasthanas beyond the second. The Panchendriyas are called knowledgeable, which can also be supported by comparison to the third, fourth, etc. Gunasthanas. But since the Dwindriyas lack the third, fourth, etc. Gunasthanas, knowledge can only be reduced in comparison to the Sasadan Gunasthan. This is clearly written in the Prajnapanna-Tika. It says, "How can two knowledges be reduced in the Dwindriya? Because it has the Sasadan Gunasthan in the Aparapsa state, two knowledges can be reduced in comparison to that."

"Beintiyanam Bhanta. Ki Nani Anani? Goyama! Nano Vi Anani Vi. Je Nani Te Niyama Punani. Tam Jaha - Aminimohhipanani Suyanani. Je Anani Te Vi Niyama Tuannani. Pahama Anani Suyanani Ya." - Bhagavati Shatak 80.2.

"Beviyars Vo Nana Kahan Lambhati? Anana, Sasayanam Panch Tassapajjat Pass Do Gana Lati." - Prajnapanna Tika.

According to Karmagrantha, ignorance is considered to be present in the second Gunasthan, which is clear from the 20th and 48th Gatha. In Gommatasar, the opinion of Karmaadhik is prevalent. For this, see the 686th and 504th Gatha of the Jeevakanda.

## Karmagranth Part Four
(b) The **Siddhant** believes that when creating the **Vaikriya** and **Aharak** bodies through **Labdhi**, there is **Audarik Misrayog**; but when discarding them, there is **Vaikriya Misrayog** and **Aharak Misrayog** respectively. In contrast, the **Karmagranth** believes that when creating both bodies and discarding them, there is **Kriya Misrayog** and **Aharak Misrayog** respectively, not **Audarik Misrayog**.

The **Siddhant**'s intention is that when a **Kriya** or **Aharak** body is created through **Labdhi**, it is created by the **Audarik** body, which is suitable for these bodies. Therefore, due to the **Audarik** body's dominance, **Audarik Misrayog** should be used when creating both bodies. However, during discarding, the **Audarik** body does not hold dominance. At that time, the **Kriya** or **Aharak** body's activity is the main one, so **Vaikriya Misrayog** and **Aharak Misrayog** should be used.

The **Karmagranth**'s opinion is that regardless of which body's activity is dominant, the **Audarik** body is **Janma-Siddh** (innate) and the **Deutriya** or **Aharak** body is **Samdhi-Janma** (created through association). Therefore, considering the dominance of the specific **Jay** body, the beginning and...

1- This opinion is clear from the following quote in the **Prashasana**:
"**Oralya Sari Ekayavyayoghe Moralya Misra Sarira Kayayoghe Lej Viyasa Sari Kayayoghe Aharak Sarira Kayayoghe Aharak Misra Sarira Kayayoghe**." (Pado 16 and its commentary, page 317)

The **Karmagranth**'s opinion is clear from the 46th and 47th verses, which mention eleven and thirteen **Yogas** in the fifth and sixth **Gunasthanas** respectively. The **Gommatasar**'s opinion seems to be similar to the **Karmagranth**, as it does not consider **Audarik Misrayog** in the fifth and sixth **Gunasthanas**. See the 703rd verse of the **Jivakand**.

**Parityaag, both times Pakriyamish and Mahaarakamishra should be used, not Movarikabhitra.**

**(g) Siddhanti**, in Afeendriyas, do not accept Sasatanguṇasthān, but accept Kāmapranyik.

In the minds of the above mentioned subjects, where there is no -m:

**(1)** Siddhanti, consider Avadhivarshan in the first twelve Guṇasthāns, but Kārmāpanthik consider it deceitfully in the twelfth Guṇasthān. 

**(2)** In Siddhant, it is said that there is Aupachamikasamyaktva after the end of Pranthi-Mev, but in Karmagranth, there is Aupachamikasamyaktva. ||46||

**1** Bhagavati, Prashapana and Jivabhigamsutra have said that Ekeendriyas are Ashani. This proves that Sasadan-Bhash Siddhaamsasammmat is not in them. If it were, then like Dwiendriya etc., Ekeendriyas would also be called Gyanis.

"Egibiyaṇam Bhanta. Ki Maani Amaano? Goyama! Mo Namni, Niyama Mantrani."

Bhagavati-Sh. 8, U. 2. The Kārmāgranthik-mav in Panchasangrah states that Sasadan-Bhav is in Ekeendriya. As:

"Igivigilesu Jayatam" etc. Dwa. 1, Ga. 28.

In the Digambar Sampraday, both Siddhanti and Kārmāgranthik opinions are collected. By looking at the 113 to 115 verses of Karmakand, it is clear that Sasadan-Bhav is accepted in Ekeendriyas. In Tattvarth, A. 1, 8th Sutra, in Sarvarth Siddhi, and in Jivakand, 677th verse, there is Siddhanti opinion.

**Karmagrantha Maga Char**
(4-5) - Leshya and Bandha in Gunasthanas. 

**Chasu Sabba Seutigan. Igi Chasu Sukka Ayogi Allesa. Bandhass Miich Avir'ai, Kasayajo Gatti Ch Heu.** ||50||

**Shatsu Sarvastejas Tramekasmin Shatsu Shukla Ayogino Leshyaah. Sy Midhyatva Aviratika Krishna Ayoga Iti Chatvaro Hetavaah.** ||10||

**Meaning:**

In the first six Gunasthanas, there are six Leshyas. There are two opinions regarding the seventh Khaya Gunasthana. The first opinion states that there are six Leshyas in the first four Gunasthanas, while the second opinion states that there are six Leshyas in the first six Gunasthanas. The first opinion is found in Sangraha-Dva 1, Ga 30, Prachina Bandhaswamitva, Ga 40; Navina Bandhaswamitva, Ga 25; Sarvarthasiddhi, page 24; and Gommatasar-Jivakanda, Ga 703. The second opinion is found in Prachina Chaturtha Karmagrantha, Ga 73, and Maha. Both opinions are relatively acceptable, so there is no contradiction between them.

The first opinion implies that those with all six types of Dravya Leshyas attain the fourth Gunasthana, but only those with three auspicious Dravya Leshyas attain the fifth or sixth Gunasthana. Therefore, when considering Gunasthana attainment, six Leshyas should be considered up to the fourth Gunasthana, and only three in the fifth and sixth.

The second opinion implies that although the fourth Gunasthana is attained with all six Leshyas, and the fifth and sixth Gunasthanas are attained with three auspicious Dravya Leshyas, all six Dravya Leshyas are present in those who attain the fourth, fifth, and sixth Gunasthanas. Therefore, after attaining the Gunasthanas, six Leshyas are considered up to the sixth Gunasthana.

**Note:**

It is important to remember that when attaining the fourth, fifth, and sixth Gunasthanas, the Bhava Leshya is auspicious, not inauspicious. However, after attaining these Gunasthanas, the Bhava Leshya can become inauspicious.

**'**

The beginning is with the Leshyas. In the fourteenth Gunasthan, there are three Leshyas: Tejas Padma and Shulka. From the eighth to the thirteenth Gunasthan, there are no Leshyas in any of the Gunasthanas. There are four reasons for Karma-bandha for the purpose of Bandha: 3 Kayas and 4 Yogas. || 50 ||

**Meaning:** Each Leshya is a form of Vyavsayasthan (Sankeksha - mixed, Asantparinam). Therefore, it should be understood that there are as many levels as there are: Teeravrat, Teeravratar, Teeravratam, Mand, Mandchatar, Mandatam, etc. Therefore, the Krushna, etc., inauspicious Leshyas are considered to be Atimandatam in the Gunasthan and Atiteeravratam in the first Gunasthan.

Their connection has been stated up to the sixth Gunasthan. In the seventh Gunasthan, due to the absence of Jata and Rod-Dhyan, the results are so pure that inauspicious Leshyas are completely absent in that Gunasthan; however, there are three auspicious Leshyas. In the first Gunasthan, the Tejas and Padma Leshyas are Atimandatam, and in the seventh Gunasthan, they are Ati...

This has been discussed in detail by Shri Jinabhadragani Kshamasraman in his Bhashya from verses 2741 to 2742, by Shri Haribhadrasuri in his Tika, and by Maladhari Shramchandrasuri in his Bhashyavritti. For this topic, the verses from 313 to 323 in the third Sangha of Lokaprakash should be seen.

At the time of attaining the fourth Gunasthan, Dravyaleshya is considered to be both auspicious and inauspicious, and Bhavaleshya is only auspicious. Therefore, there is a doubt: Do those with inauspicious Dravyaleshya also have auspicious Bhavaleshya?

The solution to this is that there is no rule regarding the relationship between Dravyaleshya and Bhavaleshya that they should be the same, because although humans are Tripatra, whose Dravyaleshya is unstable, they have the same Bhavaleshya as their Dravyaleshya. But Devatarak, whose Dravyaleshya is considered to be stable (avasthit), is the opposite. That is, even though there is cruelty in Narakas, Bhavaleshya can be auspicious. Similarly, in Devas with auspicious Dravyaleshya, Bhavaleshya can also be inauspicious. To understand this clearly, one should see the 17th Pada of Prajnapan and its Tika.

Karmagranth Part Four, the most intense, in the same way, has also explained the relationship of Shulkaleshya in the Gunasthanas by considering it as Matimata in the first Gunasthana and Atitivratam in the thirteenth!
Four Bandha-Hetus' (1) 'Mimyaashva' is the result of the soul, which

1- These twelve Bandha Hetus are mentioned in the first verse of Pancha Sangrah - Dwa 4 and the 786th verse of the Dharmakaand. Although, in the first sutra of the tenth chapter of Tattvarth, Pramada has also been considered as a Bandha Hetu, but it is included in the Hetus like Aviriti, Kashaya, etc. For example: Pramada in the form of Vishay Seva, Aviriti and Sabdhi Prayog in the form of Pramada, Yoga. In reality, Kashaya and Yoga should be considered as the two Bandha Hetus; Mithyatva and Aviriti are included in Kashaya. With this intention, only two Bandha Hetus have been mentioned in the verse of the fifth Karmagranth.
·
Here, the general Hetus of Karma-Bandha have been shown, from a general perspective; therefore, they should be considered as Antarang Hetus. In the verses 54 to 61 of the first Karmagranth; in the sutras 11 to 26 of the sixth chapter of Tattvarth and in the verses 800 to 810 of the Karmakaand, the Bandha Hetus of each Karma have been mentioned, so from a practical perspective, they should be considered as Bahirang Hetus.
P
Doubt - It is mentioned in the 24th verse of Pragyapana that seven Karmas are bound at every moment except Aayu, therefore, even while hating or destroying Shana, Gyanee, etc., the binding of other Karmas like Gyaanavaranee, Darshanavaranee, etc., takes place. In this situation, how can the special Hetus of Asrava, Gyaanavaranee and Darshanavaranee, etc., mentioned in the sutras 11 to 26 of the sixth chapter of Tattvarth, like 'Tattvadoshanihriya', etc., be possible?
Solution - The special Hetus mentioned for each Karma, like Tattvdoshaniv, etc., are in relation to Anubhagbandha, not in relation to Prakritibandha. That is, during the consumption of any Asrava, Prakritibandha takes place in all ways. There is a difference in Anubhagbandha. For example: During the time of polluting Gyaan, Gyanee, Gyaanopkaran, etc., the binding of other Prakritis like Gyaanavaranee and Darshanavaranee takes place, but at that time, Anubhagbandha specifically takes place only of Gyaanavaranee and Darshanavaranee Karma. In summary, the division of special Hetus has been done in relation to Anubhagbandha, not in relation to Prakritibandha. - Satvarth A 106, Sutra 27 of Sarvarth Siddhi.

**Mithyatva** arises from the emergence of Mithyatva-mohaniya karma, which gives rise to doubt and delusion. (2) **Avirati** is the result that arises from the emergence of Ashaya-avaranakshaya, which hinders conduct. (3) **Kshamaya** is the result that arises from the emergence of Charitra-mohaniya karma, which prevents or hinders the manifestation of qualities like forgiveness, humility, simplicity, contentment, seriousness, etc. (4) **Yoga** refers to the fluctuations (chanchalya) of the self-intrusions, which occur due to the dependence on the appropriate puvgalas of the mind, speech, or body. || 50 ||

**Abhighahika, anabhighahika, amaniveshika, sanshayika, anabhoga.**

**Pancha mithyatva ti dvadasha aviratayo, manahkarana niyam shadjiva badha.** || 51 ||

**Meaning:** After the destruction of the five types of Mithyatva, there are: 1. Abhighahika, 2. Anabhighahika, 3. Amaniveshika, 4. Sanshayika, and 5. Anabhoga.

There are twelve types of Avirati. These are: - Not controlling the mind and the five senses, these six are the destruction of the six bodies, starting with the earth body. || 51 ||

**Note:** This topic is discussed in Pancha-sangraha, Chapter 2, verses 2-4, and in Gommatsar Karmakanda, verses 786-788. In Gommatsar, there are five types of Mithyatva: 1. Ekanta, 2. Vipreet, 3. Vainayika, 4. Sanshayika, and 5. Agnana.

For Avirati, refer to the 26th and 477th verses of the Jiva-kanda, and for Kshaya and Yoga, refer to the Kshaya and Yoga-maganna respectively. In the commentary on the first sutra of the Tattvartha chapter, there are two types of Mithyatva: Abhigrita and Anamigrita.

## Karma Granth, Chapter 4: Four Types of False Beliefs

**1. Abhigrahika Mithyatva:**  This is the false belief of favoring one doctrine without examining its truth, and then rejecting other doctrines. (21)

**2. Anamihika Mithyatva:** This is the false belief of considering all doctrines equal without examining their truth. (13)

**3. Abhiniveshika Mithyatva:** This is the false belief of clinging to a doctrine even after knowing its falsity. (4)

**Explanation:**

* A Samyaktva (perfectly enlightened being) never favors a doctrine without examining it. Therefore, a person who examines a doctrine and accepts it while rejecting others is not an Abhigrahika.
* A person who claims to be a Jain (Samyaktva) based on mere outward practices without examining the truth is a "Jain" in name only, but in reality, an Abhigrahika Mithyatvi.
* If people who are unable to examine the truth themselves rely on a true teacher (Geetaarth), they should not be considered Abhigrahika Mithyatvi, as relying on a true teacher prevents the possibility of supporting false doctrines. (Dharma Sangrah, p. 10)

**2. Anamihika Mithyatva:**

* This is found in people with weak intellect who are unable to examine the truth. They often say that all religions are equal.

**3. Abhiniveshika Mithyatva:**

* This is not a false belief if someone's faith is reversed due to lack of understanding or a misleading teacher. This is because their faith can be restored by meeting a true teacher.
* However, if someone continues to hold a false belief even after meeting a true teacher, this is Abhiniveshika Mithyatva.
* Although Acharya Siddhasena Divakara, Acharya Jinabhadragani Kshamasraman, etc., have argued for their respective doctrines, they cannot be called Abhiniveshika Mithyatvi. This is because they supported their doctrines based on the unbroken tradition of the scriptures, not out of bias.
* On the other hand, Jamali Gosthamahila, etc., supported their doctrines even though they knew they were contrary to the scriptures. Therefore, they are called Abhiniveshika. (Dharma, p. 40)

## Karmagrantha Part Four, Chapter 17

**Doubt and uncertainty about the nature of Dharma, persisting as a burning question, is called "Saanshayikamidhyatva". (5)** The absence of contemplation and special knowledge, meaning delusion in its most profound state, is called "Agabhog Midhyatva".  Out of the five, Abhigrik and Anamihik are the two major types of Midhyatva, while the remaining three are minor. This is because the first two, not being forms of misinterpretation, are the cause of intense suffering, while the remaining three, being forms of misinterpretation, are not the cause of intense suffering.

**Allowing the mind to indulge in its objects without self-awareness is called "Manavirat".** Similarly, one should understand the "Avirati" of the five senses: skin, flesh, etc.  For earth-bodied beings, harming the earth is called "Prithvika Avirati".  One should understand the "Avirati" of the remaining five actions in the same way. These twelve "Aviratis" are the main ones. All other "Aviratis", such as "Srisharvad-Avirati", "Adatt Dan-Avirati", etc., are encompassed within these twelve.

**"Midhyatva" is primarily the ultimate consequence of "Mohaniya Karma".** However, in this context, the external tendencies like "Abhigrik" etc., arising from it, are called "Midhyatva". This is not intended to differentiate between cause and effect, but rather to show that "Avirati" is a type of...

**1. Subtle doubts are found even in the highest order of saints, but they are not "Midhyatva" because ultimately...**

"**Samev Sancham Nisaankam Jam Jirnohi Paveṣṭayam.**"

...and such doubts are resolved by accepting the scriptures as proof, based on this sentiment. Therefore, any doubt that cannot be resolved by the authority of the scriptures is ultimately "Midhyatva" because it leads to misconduct. - Dharma Sangraha, page...

## Chapter Four of the Karma Granth

**5**
The result of karma is the fruit, but in this context, *mano-asanyama* (lack of control over the mind) etc. are called *avirati* (non-restraint), not considering the cause and effect as different. It is seen that the lack of control over the mind etc., or *jova* (violence) etc., are all *kṣayās* (passions) themselves. ||51||

**178**
There are nine and sixteen *kṣayās* (passions), totaling twenty-five. There are fifteen *yogas* (mental states). Thus, in total, there are fifty-seven *bandha-hetu* (causes of bondage). ||52||

**Meaning:** There are nine and sixteen *kṣayās* (passions), totaling twenty-five. There are fifteen *yogas* (mental states). Thus, in total, there are fifty-seven *bandha-hetu* (causes of bondage).

In the first *guṇa-sthāna* (stage of spiritual development), there is bondage due to all four *hetu* (causes). In the second to fifth *guṇa-sthāna*, there is bondage due to three *hetu*. In the sixth to eighth *guṇa-sthāna*, there is bondage due to five *hetu*. And in the eleventh to thirteenth *guṇa-sthāna*, there is bondage due to one *hetu*. ||52||

**Ananta-anubandha (Further Explanation):**

**Meaning:** *Hāsya* (laughter) and *rati* (attachment) etc. are nine *noka-kṣayās* (minor passions), and *kroṣa* (anger) etc. are sixteen *kṣayās* (passions), which have been discussed in the previous *karma-granth*. *Hāsya* (laughter) etc. are called *noka-kṣayās* because they are companions and stimulators of *kṣayās* (passions), but they are *kṣayās* (passions) themselves.

The detailed explanation of fifteen *yogas* (mental states) has already been given in the 24th verse. Twenty-five *kṣayās* (passions), fifteen *yogas* (mental states), and the five *mithyātva* (false beliefs) and twelve *avirati* (non-restraints) mentioned in the previous verse, all together make fifty-seven *bandha-hetu* (causes of bondage).

**Mūla-bandha-hetu (Root Causes of Bondage) in Guṇa-sthāna (Stages of Spiritual Development):**

At the time of the first *guṇa-sthāna* (stage of spiritual development), all four *hetu* (causes) are present due to *mithyātva* (false beliefs). Therefore, they are the causes of the *karma-vaśa* (bondage to karma) that occurs at that time. 

Page #250:
---------------------------
## Karmagranth Part Four

**Chapter 4: Karmagranth**

**Verse 52:**

In the first four Gunasthanas, all causes except Mithyatva are present. These are considered the main causes of karma-bandha at that time. In the sixth and subsequent five Gunasthanas, there is no Aviriti like Mithyatva. Therefore, only Kshaya and Yoga are considered the causes of karma-bandha at that time. In the eleventh and subsequent three Gunasthanas, there is no Kshaya, so only Yoga is considered the cause of bandha at that time. In the fourteenth Gunasthana, Yoga itself becomes inactive. Therefore, there is no cause of bandha at all.

**Verse 53:**

There are one hundred and twenty types of karmic substances. The causes of their original bandha are as follows:

* **Seven Vedaniya:**  Bound by all four causes (Mithyatva, Aviriti, Kshaya, and Yoga).
* **Sixteen Naraka-Nikaya:** Bound by Mithyatva alone.
* **Twenty-five Tiryanch-Trika:** Bound by Mithyatva and Aviriti.
* **Sixty-five remaining:** Bound by Mithyatva, Aviriti, and Kshaya (excluding Tirthankara and Adharaka).

**Meaning:**

The bandha of the seven Vedaniya is caused by all four causes (Mithyatva, Aviriti, Kshaya, and Yoga). The bandha of the sixteen Naraka-Nikaya is caused by Mithyatva alone. The bandha of the twenty-five Tiryanch-Trika is caused by Mithyatva and Aviriti. The bandha of the remaining sixty-five karmic substances (excluding Tirthankara and Adharaka) is caused by Mithyatva, Aviriti, and Kshaya.

**Explanation:**

There are one hundred and twenty karmic substances that are susceptible to bandha. The seven Vedaniya are bound by all four causes, while the sixteen Naraka-Nikaya are bound by Mithyatva alone. The twenty-five Tiryanch-Trika are bound by Mithyatva and Aviriti, and the remaining sixty-five are bound by Mithyatva, Aviriti, and Kshaya. This indicates that the intensity of bandha decreases as the number of causes decreases. 

Page #251:
---------------------------
## Karma Granth: A Breakdown of Binding Causes

This section delves into the causes of binding in the thirteen *gunasthana* (stages of existence). There are four main causes:

* **Pāpa:** This refers to the negative karma accumulated through actions, leading to binding in the first three *gunasthana*.
* **Yoga:** This refers to the positive karma accumulated through actions, leading to binding in the remaining ten *gunasthana*.

Therefore, there are a total of four causes for binding across all thirteen *gunasthana*.

**Binding due to Mithyatva:**

The following sixteen types of beings are bound due to *mithyatva* (false belief):

* **Naraka-trika:** Hell beings
* **Jāti-matushka:** Animals
* **Sthāvara-chatuṣka:** Stationary beings (plants, etc.)
* **Huṇḍa-saṁsthāna:**  Beings in the state of *huṇḍa* (a state of unconsciousness)
* **Ātapa-nāma-karma:** Karma related to suffering
* **Sevāt-mahamāna:** Karma related to pride
* **Napuṣaka-vēra:** Karma related to anger
* **Mithyātva:** False belief itself

These sixteen types are bound by *mithyatva* because they are considered to be in the *mahā-leśyā* (grossest) state of existence.

**Binding due to Aviriti:**

The following thirty-five types of beings are bound due to *aviriti* (non-restraint):

* **Tiyanjana-nika:**  Beings in the state of *tiyanjana* (a state of subtle consciousness)
* **Styāna-khi-trika:**  Beings in the state of *styāna-khi* (a state of dull consciousness)
* **Bubhang-trika:**  Beings in the state of *bubhang* (a state of confused consciousness)
* **Ananta-anubandhi-chatuṣka:**  Beings in the state of *ananta-anubandhi* (a state of infinite attachment)
* **Madhyama-saṁsthāna-chatuṣka:**  Beings in the state of *madhyama-saṁsthāna* (a state of moderate existence)
* **Madhyama-saṁhanana-chatuṣka:**  Beings in the state of *madhyama-saṁhanana* (a state of moderate concentration)
* **Nīcha-gotra:**  Beings of low lineage
* **Ugrīta-nāma-karma:**  Karma related to violence
* **Aśubha-bihāyoga-ti:**  Beings with unfavorable circumstances
* **Strī-vēda:**  Beings with female characteristics
* **Varṣa-bhanāra-gha-saṁhanana:**  Beings with a strong attachment to the material world
* **Manuṣya-trika:**  Human beings
* **A-pratyākhyāna-avara-ga-chatuṣka:**  Beings who are unable to renounce worldly attachments
* **Audārika-dvīka:**  Beings with a strong desire for material possessions

These thirty-five types are bound by *aviriti* because they are bound by *mithyatva* in the first *gunasthana* and by *aviriti* in the subsequent *gunasthana*.

**Binding due to Tri-hetu:**

The following sixty-five types of beings are bound due to *tri-hetu* (three causes):

* **Sāta-vēdaniya:**  Beings who experience seven types of suffering
* **Naraka-trika:**  Hell beings
* **Jāti-matushka:**  Animals
* **Sthāvara-chatuṣka:**  Stationary beings (plants, etc.)
* **Huṇḍa-saṁsthāna:**  Beings in the state of *huṇḍa* (a state of unconsciousness)
* **Ātapa-nāma-karma:**  Karma related to suffering
* **Sevāt-mahamāna:**  Karma related to pride
* **Napuṣaka-vēra:**  Karma related to anger
* **Mithyātva:**  False belief itself
* **Tiyanjana-nika:**  Beings in the state of *tiyanjana* (a state of subtle consciousness)
* **Styāna-khi-trika:**  Beings in the state of *styāna-khi* (a state of dull consciousness)
* **Bubhang-trika:**  Beings in the state of *bubhang* (a state of confused consciousness)
* **Ananta-anubandhi-chatuṣka:**  Beings in the state of *ananta-anubandhi* (a state of infinite attachment)
* **Madhyama-saṁsthāna-chatuṣka:**  Beings in the state of *madhyama-saṁsthāna* (a state of moderate existence)
* **Madhyama-saṁhanana-chatuṣka:**  Beings in the state of *madhyama-saṁhanana* (a state of moderate concentration)
* **Nīcha-gotra:**  Beings of low lineage
* **Ugrīta-nāma-karma:**  Karma related to violence
* **Aśubha-bihāyoga-ti:**  Beings with unfavorable circumstances
* **Strī-vēda:**  Beings with female characteristics
* **Varṣa-bhanāra-gha-saṁhanana:**  Beings with a strong attachment to the material world
* **Manuṣya-trika:**  Human beings
* **A-pratyākhyāna-avara-ga-chatuṣka:**  Beings who are unable to renounce worldly attachments
* **Audārika-dvīka:**  Beings with a strong desire for material possessions
* **Tīrthaṅkara-nāma-karma:**  Karma related to being a *Tīrthaṅkara* (a Jain prophet)
* **Āhāraka-trika:**  Beings who are *āhāraka* (those who consume food)

These sixty-five types are bound by *tri-hetu* because they are bound by *mithyatva* in the first *gunasthana*, by *aviriti* in the next four *gunasthana*, and by *kaṣāya* (passions) in the remaining four *gunasthana*.

**The Dominance of Causes:**

While *mithyatva*, *aviriti*, and *kaṣāya* are all present in their respective *gunasthana*, the dominant cause is the one that is most prominent in that particular stage. Therefore, *mithyatva* is considered the primary cause of binding in the first *gunasthana*, *aviriti* in the next four, and *kaṣāya* in the remaining four. 

Page #252:

## Karmagrantha Part Four

**181** In this place, the cause of the bondage of Tirthankara-nama karma is only Samyak-tva, and the cause of the bondage of Aharak-dvik is only Samyama, which is intended. Therefore, these three natures are not counted among the Kashaya-hesauk natures. ||53||

**General and Specific Description of Uttar Bandha-Hetus in Gunasthanas**
[From five verses] Pan-panna pan tiyachhi-achatt gan-chatt ch-chaud-gavi-sa. Sollas bas nav nav sa,-tt he-uno na u ajogimi. ||54||

**1.** In the 16th verse of the 4th door of Panchasangrah-dwar, "Sesa u phasae-ti." From this verse, Tirthankara-nama karma and Aharak-dvik, these three natures are considered Kashaya-hetuk, and in the 20th Maya of Agaji, Samyav is said to be the special Hetu of Tirthankara-nama karma and Samyama is said to be the special Hetu of Aharak-dvik. In the Sarvarthasiddhi of the 1st Sutra of Tatvartha-A. also, these three natures are considered Kashaya-hetuk. But Shri Devendrasuri has not called the bondage of these three natures Kashaya-hetuk. His intention seems to be only to show the special Hetu, not the prohibition of Kashaya, because the causality of Yoga in the nature and Pradesh-bandha of all karma, and the causality of Kashaya in the state and Anubhag-bandha is established beyond doubt. Special consideration of this is worth seeing in the Thimlayagiri-tika of the 2nd verse of Panchasangrah-dwar.

**2.** This topic is in the 5th verse of the 4th door of Panchasangrah-dwar, and in the 786th and 760th verses of Gommatsar Karmakanda.

**Uttar Bandha Hetu** has two divisions: general and specific. The Bandha-Hetu found simultaneously in all beings present in a particular Gunasthana is called 'general', and the Bandha-Hetu found simultaneously in one being is called 'specific'. In the 77th verse of the ancient fourth Karmagrantha, and in this place, there is a description of the general Uttar Bandha-Hetu. But in Panchasangrah and Gommatsar, there is a description of both types of Bandha-Hetus: general and specific. In the tika of Panchasangrah, this difference is explained very clearly. The description of the specific Uttar Bandha-Hetu is very detailed and profound.

## Chapter Four of the Karma Granth - 55, 50, 43, 46, 49, 22, 16, 10, 9, 9, 7

**Verse 54:**

There are 55 mantra-hetu in the first guna-sthana, 50 in the second, 43 in the third, 46 in the fourth, 49 in the fifth, 22 in the sixth, 16 in the seventh, 10 in the eighth and ninth, and 7 in the tenth. There are no bandha-hetu in the eleventh and twelfth guna-sthana.

**Verse 55:**

In the Misha-ashti gana-sthana, there are 55 bandha-hetu, excluding the aharaka-haka. In the Saksha-avana gana-sthana, there are 50 bandha-hetu, excluding the five mithyatva. In the Misha-du-ga gana-sthana, there are...

Page #254:
---------------------------
## Karmagrantha Maag Four

There are forty-three **bandha-hetu** (causes of bondage) excluding the four **karman** (karmic actions), **anantaanubandhi** (infinitely connected), and the **chaturshka** (four).

**183**

1. In the **Aviratasamyadrishti** (unwavering perception) **gunasthan** (stage of spiritual development), there are forty-six **bandha-hetu** in total, including the aforementioned forty-three, **karman**, **auvarikamitra** (friend of the world), and **vaikriyamishra** (mixed with the world).

In the **Deshaviriti** (renunciation of worldly attachments) **gunasthan**, there are forty-one **bandha-hetu** excluding the seven: **karman**, **auvarikamishra**, **tras** (fear), **avirati** (non-renunciation), and the **apratyakhyanavaran-chaturshka** (fourfold veil of non-rejection).

In the **Pramattasanyata** (controlled by the senses) **gunasthan**, there are twenty-six **bandha-hetu** excluding the fifteen: eleven **avirati**, **varan** (choice), and the **tuka** (two).

-

**Pratyarupaana**

In the **Aparammatasanyata** (uncontrolled by the senses) **gunasthan**, there are twenty-four **bandha-hetu** excluding the two **mishra** (mixed) **vika** (types of karmic actions): **vaiktiy-mishra** (individual mixed) and **aaharaka-mishra** (food mixed).

In the **Apuurvakaran** (unprepared) **gunasthan**, there are twenty-two **bandha-hetu** excluding the two **kayayoga** (body-related actions): **vaiktiy-kayayoga** (individual body-related) and **aaharaka-kayayoga** (food body-related).

**55** || **26** || **57**

**Maavarth** - In the 51st and 52nd **gatha** (verses), fifty-seven **bandha-hetu** are mentioned. Out of these, fifty-five **bandha-hetu** are found in the first **gunasthan** excluding the two **aaharaka-dwika** (two food-related). The **aaharaka-dwika** are related to **samyama** (self-control), which is absent in this **gunasthan**.

The absence of **samyama** in this **gunasthan** is the reason for the absence of **aaharaka-dwika**.

In the second **gunasthan**, all five **mithyatva** (false beliefs) are absent. Therefore, fifty **bandha-hetu** are mentioned excluding them.

In the third **gunasthan**, **anantaanubandhi** are absent because their emergence is limited to the second **gunasthan**. Also, due to the absence of death in this **gunasthan**, the three **yoga** (actions): **aavartika-mishra**, **vaikriyamishra**, and **aavartika-mishra** are also absent. Thus, in the third **gunasthan**, seven **bandha-hetu** are reduced, leaving forty-three **bandha-hetu** out of the aforementioned fifty. 

Page #255:
---------------------------
## The Path of Karma Granth: Four Stages

**Stage Four**

In the fourth stage, even with insufficient restraint, there is still the possibility of committing sins. Therefore, this stage encompasses three types of karma: **karmaṇ**, **audārikamitra**, and **vaikriya**. These three, along with the six **loṣa** (faults) related to the third stage, make a total of forty-six **bandha-hetu** (causes of bondage) in the fourth stage. The **apratyāstānavaraṇa** (covering of non-restraint) remains present in this stage, but it does not increase further. Therefore, it is not found in the fourth stage.

The fifth stage is characterized by **deśavirati** (restraint from the world), which includes **sa-hiṁsā** (violence) and **patrasa-adhirati** (attachment to material possessions). This stage is marked by sufficient restraint. Therefore, the two types of karma, **karmaṇ** and **audārikamitra**, are not present in this stage.

Thus, out of the forty-six **bandha-hetu** related to the fourth stage, seven are not present in the fifth stage. The remaining thirty-nine **bandha-hetu** are present in the fifth stage. These thirty-nine include the **paṁśa-miśra-kāya-yoga** (mixed body karma), but it is not present in the stage of insufficient restraint. It is **kriyālabdhi-janya** (arising from action), which occurs only in the stage of sufficient restraint.

At the time of the fifth stage, **sankalpa-anya-sa-hiṁsā** (intentional violence) is not possible. **Ārambha-janya-asa-hiṁsā** (unintentional violence) is possible, but it is very rare. Therefore, the thirty-nine **bandha-hetu** do not include **vasa-avirasi** (non-restraint from attachment to the world) because it is extremely rare.

**Stage Six**

The sixth stage is characterized by **sarvavirati** (complete restraint). Therefore, the remaining eleven **avirati** (non-restraints) are not present in this stage. The **pratyākhyānavaraṇa-kaṣāya-asuṣka** (dry covering of non-restraint) is also not present in this stage, as it remains present only until the fifth stage.

Thus, out of the forty-six **bandha-hetu** related to the fifth stage, fifteen are not present in the sixth stage, leaving twenty-four. These twenty-four, along with the two **āhārak-dvi** (two types of food) and the four **ful** (types of food), make a total of twenty-six **bandha-hetu** in the sixth stage.

In this stage, the four **muni** (ascetics) maintain their **āhārak-śarīra** (food body) through the use of **caturdaśa-pūva** (fourteen types of food). Therefore, the twenty-six **bandha-hetu** include **āhārak-vik** (food-related karma).

At the time of the beginning and end of the *vaikriya* body, there is *vaikriya* yoga, and at the time of the beginning and end of the *aharya* body, there is *aharya* yoga. However, at that time, due to the presence of *prabhas* (radiance), the seventh *guna* (quality) is not present. Therefore, these two yogas are not included in the fifteen causes of this *guna* (quality) state.

*Vaikriya* yoga occurs for those with a *vaikriya* body, and *aharya* yoga occurs for those with an *aharya* body. These two bodies are only eligible for the seventh *guna* (quality) and not for any further *guna* (quality) states. Therefore, these two yogas are not included in the *bandha* (bondage) and *moksha* (liberation) of the *pala* (stage) *guna* (quality) states. ||55, 56, 57||

## 28

*Maccha* (fish) has sixteen *ayari* (causes), *suhma* (subtle) has ten *dheya* (objects) and *sanjvalana* (agitation). *Vinu* (without) *vasati* (dwelling) *praloba* (temptation), *sajogi* (with *yoga*) *pushpa* (flower) *sagyoga* (with *yoga*).

## 18

*Apahaga* (destruction) has sixteen *badara* (causes), *suksma* (subtle) has ten *bera* (causes) and *sanjvalana* (agitation) etc. *Kshina* (diminished) *upashanta* (calm) *aloba* (without greed), *sayogi* (with *yoga*) *purvokta* (previously mentioned) *sasayoga* (with *yoga*).

## Meaning

In the *anivrutti* (non-return) *samparaya* (state) *guna* (quality) state, there are sixteen causes, excluding *hasya* (laughter) *padaka* (mark). In the *suksma* (subtle) *samparaya* (state) *guna* (quality) state, there are ten causes, excluding the three *vedas* (knowledge) and three *sanvyasana* (attachments) (including *loma* (hair)). In the *upashanta* (calm) *moha* (delusion) and *kshina* (diminished) *moha* (delusion) *guna* (quality) states, there are ten causes, excluding *sanjvalana* (agitation) *lobha* (greed). In the *sayogi* (with *yoga*) *kevali* (liberated) *guna* (quality) state, there are ten causes, all of which are *yoga* (union) forms.

## Meaning

The emergence of *hasya* (laughter) *padaka* (mark) does not occur in the *guna* (quality) states from the eighth onwards. Therefore, it should be understood that the remaining sixteen causes are present in the eighth *guna* (quality) state, excluding *hasya* (laughter) *padaka* (mark). The three *vedas* (knowledge) and *sanjvalana* (agitation) - *krodha* (anger), *mana* (pride), and *maya* (illusion) - these six emerge only up to the ninth *guna* (quality) state. Therefore, the remaining ten causes are mentioned in the tenth *guna* (quality) state, excluding these six.

Karmagranth - Part Four

The arising of the tenfold lobha (greed) remains only up to the tenth gunasthan. Apart from this, the remaining nine hetu (causes) are found in the eleventh and twelfth gunasthan. These nine hetu are: 
- Bar Manoyog (intense mental attachment)
- Khar Bachan yog (harsh speech)
- Audarik Kayayog (generous bodily actions)

In the thirteenth gunasthan, there are seven hetu:
- Sasy and Asatyamushmanoyog (attachment to truth and falsehood)
- Saty and Asatyamrushchanayog (speech of truth and falsehood)
- Audarik Kayayog (generous bodily actions)
- Dhaudarik Miakafyog (generous mental actions)
- Karman Kayayog (actions based on karma)

In the fourteenth gunasthan, there is no amaya (impurity) of yog (spiritual practice), therefore there is no bandha-hetu (cause of bondage) at all. || 5 ||

**(5)** - Mpramachamsarasaptaastan, Miabhapurvabadharasapta. Babhati Shat Cha Sukshma Ekamuparivana Abandhko'ayogi. ||5||

**Meaning:** - Until the Aprammatta Gunavan, the binding of the eight Maath Prakruti Dhokas occurs. In the Mishra, Apurshkarana and Anivriti Vadar-Gulkhana, all eight Prakrutis are bound, in the Sukshma Samparaya Gunasthan, six Prakrutis are bound, and in the Upshanta Moh etc. three Gunasthanas, one Prakruti is bound. In the Ayogikevali Gunasthan, there is no binding.

**Bhavarth:** - Except for the third, from the first to the seventh, the seven Mula Karma Prakrutis are bound in the six Gunavans. At the time of binding Aayu, one should understand the binding of eight, and at the time of not binding, the binding of seven.

In the third, eighth and ninth Gunasthanas, due to the non-binding of Aayu, only the binding of seven occurs. In the eighth and ninth Gunasthanas, the Parinamas become so subtle that they no longer have the capacity to bind Aayu. And the nature of the third Gunasthan is such that Aayu is not bound in it.

In the tenth Gunasthan, due to the non-binding of Aayu and Mohaniya, the binding of one is considered. Due to the Parinamas becoming very subtle, Aayu...

The bondage of the Moheeya is prohibited in it because there is no bondage and Badarakpayokya. ... In the eleventh and subsequent three Gunasthanas, only the bondage of the Satavedaniya occurs. Because in them, there is no Kavayoday at all, so the bondage of other natures is impossible.
In summary, in the third, eighth, and ninth Gunasthanas, there is the bondage of the Satka: in the first, second, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh Gunasthanas, there is the bondage of the Satka and the Pratka Andhasthan: in this, there is the bondage of the Shaka, and in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth Gunasthanas, there is the bondage of the Eka. ||6||

## The Eight Karmas: Their Existence and Arising

**-** In the first seven to eight Gunasthanas, there is the existence and arising of eight Karmas. In the Kshama-moha Gunasthana, both existence and arising are of seven Karmas. In the Sayogika-cheli and Prayogika-pheli Gunasthanas, both existence and arising are of four Karmas. In the Upasanta-moha Gunasthana, the existence is of eight Karmas and the arising is of seven Karmas.

**Meaning:**  Up to the subtle-sambara-guna-sthana, there is the existence and arising of eight Karmas. In the Kshama-moha Gunasthana, both existence and arising are of seven Karmas. In the Sayogika-cheli and Prayogika-pheli Gunasthanas, both existence and arising are of four Karmas. In the Upasanta-moha Gunasthana, the existence is of eight Karmas and the arising is of seven Karmas.

**Explanation:** In the first ten Gunasthanas, the eight Karmas are found in both their existence and arising states. In the eleventh Gunasthana, the Mohaniya Karma remains in its existence state but does not arise, therefore, the existence is of eight Karmas and the arising is of seven Karmas. In the Para Gunasthana, the Mohaniya Karma is completely destroyed, therefore, both existence and arising are of seven Karmas. In the twelfth and thirteenth Gunasthanas, only four Karmas exist and arise.

**Summary:** The existence of Karmas is eight in the first eleven Gunasthanas, seven in the twelfth, and four in the thirteenth and fourteenth. The arising of Karmas is eight in the first ten Gunasthanas, seven in the eleventh and Para, and four in the thirteenth and fourteenth.

## Karma Granth Part 11 (9) - Udirana in Gunasthanas [Two Gathaas]

**61.** The Promantas (those who have attained the first five Gunasthanas) experience the udirana of seven or eight karmas. The Mishragunastana experiences the udirana of eight karmas. The Apramatta, Apurvakarana, and Anivritivadara Gunasthanas experience the udirana of six karmas, excluding Vedaniya and Ayu. The Sukshma Paraya Gunastana experiences the udirana of six or five karmas. The Upshantamoga Gunastana experiences the udirana of five karmas.

**62.** **Explanation:** To understand the concept of udirana, it is important to remember that only the karmas that are currently arising experience udirana, not those that are not arising. The udirana of a karma ceases when the Pratika Pratimaan (the remaining lifespan of the karma) is exhausted.

In the first five Gunasthanas, from the first to the sixth, excluding the third, there is udirana of seven or eight karmas. When Ayu is not arising, there is udirana of seven karmas, and when it is arising, there is udirana of eight karmas. According to this rule, the udirana of Ayu ceases when the Pratimaan of the current Ayu is exhausted. Even though the Pratimaan of the current Ayu may be very small, the Pratimaan of the future Ayu is still greater.

Due to the presence of Nayaman, its Udeernaa does not occur according to that rule.
In the third Gunasthan, only Karma is considered to have Udeernaa, because death does not occur in this Gunasthan. Therefore, Mayu cannot exist in the final Aavali of this Gunasthan, as Udeernaa ceases there.
In essence, there is a perception of Saara, Saay, and Baudhau Gunvaa, but not of Mayu and Vedaniya Karma. This is because, just as Adhyavasaya is necessary for the Udeernaa of these two, there is no Madhyavasaya in the aforementioned three Gunasthanas due to their extreme purity.
In the tenth Gunasthan, there is Udeernaa of either the five Karmas or the six Karmas. When there is no Udeernaa of Mayu and Vedaniya, it should be understood as six Karmas, and when there is no Udeernaa of the aforementioned two Karmas and Mohaniya, it should be understood as five. The Udeernaa of Mohaniya ceases in the final Praavali of the Yasham Gunasthan. This is because at that time, its Spiti Bhaavali Pramaan remains.
In the Myaradhi Gunasthan, there is Udeernaa of five Karmas due to the absence of Udeernaa of Aayu, Vedaniya, and Mohaniya. In this Gunasthan, due to the absence of Nayaman, the Udeernaa of Mohaniya is prohibited.

**Meaning:**
In the Mohagunsthan, there are five or two karmas that are udirana, while in the Sogikevali Gunasthan, there are only two karmas. In the Ayogikevakhiguragamyan, there is no udirana.

The Jivas in the Upashanta Mohagunsthan are the fewest. The Jivas in the Namohagunsthan are more numerous than them. In the three Gunasthanas of Sushmasampray, Anivritiadar, and Apurvakaran, the Jivas with Dhanaman and Khinamohagunsthan have special privileges, but they are equal among themselves. ||6||

**Bhashay:**
In the twelve Gunasthanas, except for the last Shravalika, there are five karmas that are udirana at all times, except for Aayu, Vedaniya, and Mohaniya. In the last Pradhikamsha, the Avaraniya, Darshanavaniya, and Antaraya karmas remain. Therefore, their udirana is not possible at that time. The remaining two (Naam and Gosh) remain udirana.

In the thirteenth Gunasthan, only four Adhatikarma remain. Of these, Aayu and Vedaniya have already been udirana. Therefore, in this Gunasthan, only two karmas are considered udirana.

## Karma Granth - Part Four

The effect of the fourteenth virtuous yoga is described.  Without yoga, there can be no liberation, hence the effect of udirana is present.

In summary, in the third gunasthan, the udirana of the eighth is present, and the udirana of the first, second, fourth, fifth, and sixth is present in the seventh, and the udirana of the seventh is present in the tenth gunasthan.  The udirana of the sixth is present in the twelfth gunasthan until the last avalika of the tenth, the udirana of the fifth is present in the twelfth gunasthan until the dharma mavalika of the twelfth, and the udirana of the second is present in the thirteenth gunasthan until the parambhathalika of the twelfth.

**Alpa Bahutva**

The beings in the eleventh gunasthan are fewer than the beings in all other gunasthanas, because they are found in the form of pratipadyaman (those who will attain that state at a particular time) and pratipaksa (those who have attained that state before a particular time) in the form of one, two, or three, etc.  The pratipadyaman in the twelfth gunasthan are found in the form of one hundred and eight, and the purvapratipaksa are found in the form of shat-prithaktva (two to nine hundred).  Therefore, they are called sansthata-guru compared to those in the eleventh gunasthan.  The pratipadyaman in the upshamshreni are found in the form of forty-four, and the purvapratipaksa are found in the form of one, two, three, etc.  The pratipadyaman in the kshapakkshevika are found in the form of one hundred and eight, and the purvapratipaksa are found in the form of shat-prithaktva.  Both these shrenis are present in the eighth, ninth, and tenth gunasthanas.  Therefore, the beings in these three gunasthanas are equal in bhas, but they are more numerous than those in the twelfth gunasthan.  || 62 ||

## Karma Nayaya Part Four

**Chapter Heading:**  The Worthy Chief!

**Verse 1:**  The number of *samkhyat* (countable) *gunas* (qualities) in the *desh* (realm), *mas* (time), and *ad* (duration) are mixed. The *mashir* (uncountable) *gunas* are *ayogi* (unworthy), *migya* (false), *as* (non), *san* (with), *khya* (knowledge), *ar* (being), *am* (I), *tva* (ness), *aro* (and), *dva* (two), *pan* (to obtain), *anti* (they).

**Meaning:**  The *sayogik* (associated) *gunas* are *samkhyat* (countable) because they are *sannyat* (limited) in the *desh* (realm), *mas* (time), and *ad* (duration). The *pesh* (to be), *virat* (to stop), *sasadan* (to be with), *misra* (mixed), and *aviratsamyagra* (uninterrupted perfect) *gunas* are *prasankhyat* (countable) because they are *sannyat* (limited) in the *desh* (realm), *mas* (time), and *ad* (duration). The *ayopik* (unworthy) and *mithyadhi* (false) *gunas* are *asankhyat* (uncountable) because they are *sannyat* (limited) in the *desh* (realm), *mas* (time), and *ad* (duration).

**Explanation:**  The thirteen *gunas* are called *samkhyat* (countable) because they are limited to two *karod* (crores) in the *javan* (lower) *gunas* and nine *karod* (crores) in the *utkrusht* (higher) *gunas*. The seven *gunas* are limited to two thousand *karod* (crores). Therefore, they are *samkhyat* (countable) compared to the *sayogik* (associated) *gunas*. The six *gunas* are limited to nine thousand *karod* (crores). Therefore, they are *samkhyat* (countable) compared to the seven *gunas*. The *asanshayav* (doubtless) *garbh* (womb) and *tiryach* (animal) *chami* (birth) *desh* (realm) *virat* (to stop) are obtained, therefore, the five *gunas* are *asankhyat* (uncountable) compared to the six *gunas*. The two *gunas* are called *prasankhyat* (countable) compared to the *desh* (realm) *virat* (to stop) *gunas*. This is because the *desh* (realm) *virat* (to stop) is limited to two *gati* (movements), while the *sasadan* (to be with) *samyaktva* (rightness) is present in all four *gati* (movements). The *sasadan* (to be with) *samyaktva* (rightness) and *mithyashti* (false belief) are both present in all four *gati* (movements), but the *sasadan* (to be with) *samyaktva* (rightness) has a longer *kal* (time) *man* (measure) than the *misra* (mixed) *gunas*. Therefore, the *misra* (mixed) *gunas* are *asankhyat* (uncountable) compared to the *sasadan* (to be with) *samyaktva* (rightness). The four *gunas* are always present in all four *gati* (movements) and have a longer *kal* (time) *man* (measure). Therefore, they are *masankhyat* (uncountable) compared to the three *gunas*. Although the *bhavasth* (state of being) *bha yogi* (one who is in the state of being) and *apakashi* (one who is not in the state of being) have a *paravar* (limit) of one hundred *prithaktva* (separations), the *bhavasth* (state of being) *bha yogi* (one who is in the state of being) ...

**-Kshayopshamic-**  This is manifested by the destruction of the *maayopthamik-maav*. The *karma* (karmic matter) is destroyed by the *up. yavali-ashisht* (the remaining karmic matter), the *mand rasaspardhak* (the weaker karmic matter), and the *anudayaman rasaspardhak* (the stronger karmic matter). The *vipak-shakti* (the power of fruition) of the *anudayaman rasaspardhak* is either stopped or delayed. This results in the transformation of all three powers into the *mand shakti* (weaker power) form (destruction, *upsham*), *kshay* (destruction).

**4-Kshayik-** This is the *paryaay* (state) that arises from the *karma* (karmic matter) *uday* (arising).

**5-Parinaamik-** This is the state of continuous transformation into one's own nature.

One *maay* (karmic matter) should be understood as *moolbhaash* (original karmic matter) and two or more *maay* (karmic matter) combined should be understood as *saamipatik maav* (combined karmic matter).

**The Different Types of Bhaav (States):**

The *upshamik-bhaav* (state of destruction) has two types: *samyaktva* (right faith) and *charitra* (conduct).

**(1) Samyaktva:** The *tattva-kachi-yaak* (the knowledge of the true nature of reality) *bhaatya-parinaam* (manifestation) that arises from the destruction of the *magnatanubandhi-chatushk* (the four types of karmic matter that bind the soul to the material world) and the *darshanmohaniyakarma* (the karmic matter that obscures the vision of the soul) is called *shri-psharmik-samyaktva* (right faith).

**(2) Charitra:** The *sthiraatamak parinaam* (stable manifestation) that arises from the destruction of the twenty-five types of *charitramohaniyakarma* (the karmic matter that obscures the conduct of the soul) is called *aaupmik-charitra* (conduct). This is the same as the *yatha-sthaat-charitra* (conduct that is in accordance with the true nature of the soul) that is attained in the eleventh *gunasthan* (stage of spiritual development).

The *upshamik-bhaav* (state of destruction) is the end of suffering.

## Karmadhyaya Chapter Four

**Verse 65:**

There are eighteen distinctions of *kshayopaśamika* (subduing) emotions, excluding the two *kevala* (perfect) emotions. The remaining ten *upayoga* (applications), the five *sandi* (bonds), *samyaktvam* (right faith), and *deśaviratī* (freedom from attachment to place) and *sarvaviratī* (freedom from attachment to all) are the eighteen distinctions.

**Explanation:**

There are nine *kshayopaśamika* emotions. The two *kevala* emotions, *kevaladarśana* (perfect vision) and *kevalajñāna* (perfect knowledge), manifest when the *kevalajñānāvaraṇīya* (veil of perfect knowledge) and *kevaladarśanāvaraṇīya* (veil of perfect vision) karmas are completely destroyed. The five *labdhi* (achievements) - *dāna* (giving), *lābha* (gain), *bhoga* (enjoyment), *upabhoga* (consumption), and *vīrya* (vigor) - manifest when the *dānāntarāya* (obstacle to giving), *sāmāntarāya* (obstacle to gain), *bhogāntarāya* (obstacle to enjoyment), *upabhogāntarāya* (obstacle to consumption), and *vīryāntarāya* (obstacle to vigor) karmas are completely destroyed. *Samyaktvam* (right faith) manifests when the *samyaktvam*, *anantānubandhicatuṣka* (four infinite consequences), and *darśanamohaṇīya* (veil of perception) karmas are completely destroyed. *Cāritra* (conduct) manifests when all the *cāritramohaṇīya* (veil of conduct) karmas are completely destroyed. This is the "Yathākhyāta Cāritra" (conduct as it is known) that is attained in the twelfth *guṇasthāna* (stage of spiritual development).

All *kshayopaśamika* emotions are *sāvi* (permanent) because they are caused by *karma* (action) and are not subject to further obscuration by *karma*.

There are eighteen distinctions of *kshayopaśamika* emotions. For example:

* The ten *upayoga* (applications) excluding the two *kevala* (perfect) emotions.
* The five *sandi* (bonds) - *dāna* (giving), *lābha* (gain), *bhoga* (enjoyment), *upabhoga* (consumption), and *vīrya* (vigor).
* *Samyaktvam* (right faith).
* *Deśaviratī* (freedom from attachment to place) and *sarvaviratī* (freedom from attachment to all) *cāritra* (conduct).

* *Matijñāna* (knowledge of mind), *mati* (mind), and *ajñāna* (ignorance) manifest when the *matijñānāvaraṇīya* (veil of knowledge of mind) karma is subdued.
* *Śruta* (scriptural knowledge), *mahān* (great), and *śruta* (scriptural knowledge) manifest when the *śruta* *jñānāvaraṇīya* (veil of scriptural knowledge) karma is subdued.
* *Avadhijñāna* (clairvoyance) and *vibhanga* (knowledge of the parts) manifest when the *adhikāmavaraṇīya* (veil of excessive desires) karma is subdued.
* *Manaḥparyāya* (mental transformation) manifest when the *manaḥparyāya* *jñānāvaraṇīya* (veil of mental transformation) karma is subdued.
* *Caturdarśana* (fourfold vision), *achakṣurdarśana* (vision without eyes), and *avadhi* *darśana* (clairvoyance) manifest when the *caturdarśanāvaraṇīya* (veil of fourfold vision), *achakṣurdarśanāvaraṇīya* (veil of vision without eyes), and *avadhi* *darśanāvaraṇīya* (veil of clairvoyance) karmas are subdued.
* The five *sandi* (bonds) - *dāna* (giving), *lābha* (gain), *bhoga* (enjoyment), *upabhoga* (consumption), and *vīrya* (vigor) - manifest when the five types of *antarāya* (obstacle) karmas are subdued.
* *Samyaktvam* (right faith) manifests when the *anantānubandhicatuṣka* (four infinite consequences) and *darśanamohaṇīya* (veil of perception) karmas are subdued.
* *Deśaviratī* (freedom from attachment to place) manifests when the *apratyākhānāvaraṇīya* (veil of non-rejection) *kṣaya* (destruction) karma is subdued.
* *Pratyāyānāghāta* (non-obstruction of the path of liberation) manifests when the *pratyāyānāghāta* *jñānāvaraṇīya* (veil of non-obstruction of the path of liberation) karma is subdued.

The destruction and pacification of the nine kṣayās leads to the cessation of all vices. Intellect, ignorance, etc., are the kṣayās that are pacified by the destruction of the āvaraṇīya karma, which is beginningless and endless, and the knowledge, etc., are the kṣayās that are pacified by the destruction of the mohanīya karma, which is finite. Intellect, knowledge, etc., are the states of the bhavya, which are both finite and infinite, and the gifts, etc., that are obtained, and the non-perception, are the states of the sāmsāra, which are beginningless and endless. || 65 ||

The non-perfection of the soul, the restraint of the senses, the kṣayās, the gatis, the vedas, and the false belief, these are the four (aupadhika) states of the soul. The state of being a bhavya, the state of being an abhavya, and the state of being a jīva, these are the pariṇāmika states. || 66 ||

**Meaning:** There are many states of the soul, such as: greatness, non-perfection, non-restraint, kṣayās, gatis, vedas, and false belief. Ignorance means both the absence of knowledge and false knowledge. The absence of knowledge is the result of the arising of the āvaraṇīya karma, and the false knowledge is the result of the arising of the mohanīya karma. Therefore, both types of ignorance are aupadhika. Non-perfection refers to the state of being in samsāra. This is the eighth...

**Explanation:** 

1. Sleep, pleasure, pain, laughter, body, etc., are countless states that arise from the arising of different karmas. All of these are aupadhika. In this place, the author has explained the aupadhika states in a gross way, following the statements of the previous ācāryas like Śrīmati, etc.

2. Intellect, śruta-jñāna, and vijñāna have been mentioned as kṣayās in the previous verse. They are called kṣayās because they are caused by the destruction of the āvaraṇīya karma, etc., and they are called kṣayās because their cause is the destruction of the mohanīya karma.

... ... ... is the fruit of the arising of karma. In this context, there is an absence of *pirat*. This is the result of the arising of *apratyanapanaparanipkapkay*. Due to differences in opinion, there are three forms of *paka*:-(1) *kashayik-parinam*, (2) *karma-parinati* and (3) *yog-parinam*. All three are *praudyik* because *kashayik-parinam* is the fruit of the arising of *kashay*, *karma-parinati* is the fruit of the arising of *karma* and *yog-parinam* is the fruit of the arising of *shuriranamakarma*. *Kashay* arises from the arising of *kayamohaniyakarma*. *Gati*s are born from the arising of *gatimamakarma*. *Idhy* and *bhay* both types of *ved* are *praudyik*. *Prakritik* arises from the arising of *dravya myopasanam karma* and *abhilavarup bhasaved* arises from the arising of *damohaniyakarma*. *Mithyatva* is an unwise, dark, and deluded state, which is the result of the arising of *mithyatvamohaniyakarma*. *Praudyik-bhay* is *anadi-ananta* for *abhavya* and *anadi-santa* for *many* in many cases.

*Jivattva*, *bhavya* and *abhavya* are three *parivaamik-bhav*. To sustain life is *jivattva*. This is present in all living beings, both worldly and *siddha*, and is therefore more widespread (more prevalent) than *bhavya* and *abhavya*. *Bhavya* is only present in *bhavya* beings and *abhavya* is only present in *abhavya* beings. *Parinamik-bhav* is *anadi-ananta*.

There are a total of 50 types of *bhav* across five categories: - two *shripashmik*, nine *kashayik*, eighteen *kayopashmik*, twenty *praudyik* and three *parinamik*! 666 ||

*Parinam* arises from the four *sakhai*s. It is also born from the four *upsamaj*s. Only *parinam* arises from the four *udyak*s. || 6 ||

*Siddha*s are in the *khag-parinam*. *Nara*s are in the *panajog* and *upsamaj*. These are the 18 *sannivaiy*s. There are 20 *asambhavi*s. || 18 ||

**Chapter 68**

There are four types of *saannipaatika* (simultaneous) *bhaava* (states) in the four *gati* (states of existence) due to the mixed results of *kshaayika* (destructive), *parinaamika* (transformative), and *praudaabika* (materialistic) *bhaava*. These four *bhaava* are found in the *gati* due to the tri-combination of the aforementioned three *bhaava* and one *shaabika* (corporeal) *bhaava*. Similarly, the tri-combination of the aforementioned three *bhaava* and one *aupashamika* (pacifying) *bhaava* results in another type of *saannipaatika* *bhaava*. Therefore, there are two types of *saannipaatika* *bhaava*, each with four variations.

The *saannipaatika* *bhaava* resulting from the tri-combination of *kshaayika*, *parinaamika*, and *praudaabika* *bhaava* is found only in *kevali* (omniscient) beings with physical bodies. The *saannipaatika* *bhaava* resulting from the dual combination of *jnaayika* (knowledge-based) and *parinaamika* *bhaava* is found only in *siddha* (liberated) beings. The *saannipaatika* *bhaava* resulting from the combination of all five *bhaava* is found only in humans who are in the *upabhramshreni* (state of delusion).

Therefore, there are fifteen variations of the six *saannipaatika* *bhaava*. The remaining twenty *saannipaatika* *bhaava* are *sanbhavi* (non-existent).

**Explanation**

*Saannipaatika* *bhaava* arises when two, three, four, or five of the five *bhaava* (kshaayika, kshaayopashamika, aupashamika, parinaamika, and praudaabika) combine. The *saannipaatika* *bhaava* resulting from the combination of two *bhaava* is called *dvik-sannyoga* (dual combination), the combination of three *bhaava* is called *trik-sannyoga* (triple combination), the combination of four *bhaava* is called *chatussannyoga* (quadruple combination), and the combination of five *bhaava* is called *panch-sannyoga* (quintuple combination).

There are ten variations of *dvik-sannyoga*:

1. *aupashamika* + *kshaayika*
2. *aupashamika* + *kshaayopashamika*

... and so on.

**A Division of Post-Combination - 1: Aupashmik + Kshayik + Kshayopa-shaamik + Audayik + Parinaamik**

All together, there are twenty-five divisions of Sonipatik-Bhash. Out of these, the six divisions found in living beings are shown in the Gatha-shrama.

Out of the aforementioned divisions of Trik-Sangyog, the tenth division, Kshayopa-shaamik, is known through the combination of Parinaamik and Shridayik. It is found in all four gatis. Thus, in the Barogati, the living beings have Kshayopa-shaamik-Bhash in the form of Bhavaindriya, Parinaamik-Bhash in the form of Jeevatva, and Audayik-Bhash in the form of Kay. In this way, there are divisions of this Trik-Sangyog in terms of Gati, Roop, and Sthan.

Out of the aforementioned divisions of Chatuh-Sangyog, the five divisions are found in all four gatis. Therefore, there are four divisions based on Sthan-Bhed. In all four gatis, Kshayik-Bhash is in the form of Kshayik-Samyaktva, Kshayopa-shaamik-Bhash is in the form of Bhavaindriya, Parinaamik-Bhash is in the form of Jeevatva, and Audayik-Bhash is in the form of Kay.

Out of the five divisions of Panch-Sangyog, the fourteen divisions are found in all four gatis. In all four gatis, Aupashmik-Bhash is in the form of Samyaktva, Kshayopa-shaamik-Bhash is in the form of Bhavaindriya, Parinaamik-Bhash is in the form of Jeevatva, and Audayik-Bhash is in the form of Kay. This Panch-Sangyog, Sonipatik, also has four divisions based on Gati and Sthan-Bhed.

Out of the aforementioned divisions of Trik-Sangyog, the living beings have only one type of division, which is found in Bhavasya Kevalis. In Kevalis, Parinaamik-Bhash is in the form of Jeevatva, Audayik-Bhash is in the form of Kay, and Kshayik is only in the form of Kevalgyan.

Out of the aforementioned ten divisions of Trik-Sangyog, the seventh division is found only in Siddha Jeevas, and therefore, it is only of one type. In Siddhas, Parinaamik-Bhash...

The **Kshayik-Bhav** is of the form of **Jivattva** etc., while the **Kevalgyan** etc. are of the form of **Bhir**. The **Sannipattik-Bhav**, which is of the form of **Panch-Sangyog**, is only **Upsham**-like. Therefore, it is of only one type: **Upsham**- श्रेणी वाले मनुष्यों में **Kshayik-Bhav** is of the form of **Samya**, **Kshayopa-shamik-Bhav** is of the form of **Bhavendriya** etc., **Parinamik-Bhav** is of the form of **Jivattva** etc., and **Maudayik-Bhav** is of the form of **Leshya** etc.

Thus, there are fifteen types of **Sannipattik-Bhav** in total, according to the **Sam-mese** (categories).

**|| 67 || 68 ||**

**Karma** and **Dharmaastikaya** etc. are **Ajiva** substances. **Moha** is the same as **Miso**, **Vadvaisa** is the same as **Atthakamsu**, and **Sesa** is the same as **Dhamma**. **Parinamik** is the same as **Mave** and **Sandha** is the same as **Udaae** and **Shi**.

**|| 66 ||**

**Moha** and **Shamo** are the same as **Yashtakarm** and **Sesa**. **Dharma** etc. are **Parinamik** and **Skandha** is the same as **Udaye** and **Api**.

**|| 69 ||**

**Meaning:**

The **Upshamik-Bhav** is only of **Mohaniya Karma**. The **Mishra** (**Kshayopa-shamik**) **Bhav** is only of the four **Ghatik** (destructive) **Karma**. The remaining three **Bhav** (**Kshayik**, **Parinamik**, and **Maudayik**) are of the **Bhadra** (beneficial) **Karma**.

The **Parinamik-Bhav** of **Dharmaastikaya** etc. **Ajiva** substances is **Shraddhik** and **Parinamik**, these two **Bhav** are of the **Putra-Skandha**.

**|| 66 ||**

**Meaning of the Bhav:**

In relation to **Karma**, the meaning of **Upshamik** etc. **Bhav** is:

1. **Karma** is the **Bhadra**, **Panch-Sangrah-Dva** (five categories of **Karma**) is the **Reki** (explanation) of the 25th **Gatha**.
2. The word **Upshamik** has two meanings:
    * **Upsham** etc. states of **Karma** are the **Upshamik** etc. **Bhav**. This meaning applies to **Karma**.
    * **Upsham** etc. states of **Karma** are the **Paryaya** (synonyms) of **Upshamik** etc. **Bhav**, which apply to **Bhav**, as explained in the 64th and 66th **Gatha**.

The text discusses the different states of karma, which is a key concept in Jainism. It explains how karma manifests in various ways, affecting the soul's journey.

**Karma Granth Mag Par**

This phrase likely refers to a specific text or section within a text related to karma.

**States of Karma**

The text describes different states of karma, each with its own characteristics:

* **Upashram:** This state is characterized by the presence of all types of karma except for Mohaniya karma (karma related to delusion).
* **Kshayopa-shram:** This state is characterized by the absence of all types of karma except for Mohaniya karma.
* **Jay:** This state is characterized by the presence of all types of karma except for Mohaniya karma and the four Ghatikarma (karma related to the four types of obstacles).
* **Uday:** This state is characterized by the presence of all types of karma except for Mohaniya karma, the four Ghatikarma, and the three Bhaghatikarma (karma related to the three types of passions).
* **Paribhraman:** This state is characterized by the presence of all types of karma.

**Types of Karma**

The text also mentions different types of karma:

* **Mohaniya Karma:** Karma related to delusion.
* **Ghatikarma:** Karma related to the four types of obstacles:
    * **Jnanavaraniya:** Karma related to the obstruction of knowledge.
    * **Darshanavaraniya:** Karma related to the obstruction of perception.
    * **Antakarma:** Karma related to the obstruction of liberation.
    * **Ayushkarma:** Karma related to the lifespan.
* **Bhaghatikarma:** Karma related to the three types of passions:
    * **Krodha:** Anger.

    * **Lobha:** Greed.

**Ajiva Dravya (Non-Living Substances)**

The text mentions five non-living substances:

* **Dharma-astikaya:** The substance that supports the soul's upward movement.
* **Adharma-astikaya:** The substance that supports the soul's downward movement.
* **Akasha-astikaya:** The substance that is space.
* **Kala:** Time.
* **Punya-astikaya:** The substance that is merit.

**Pari-naamik (Transformation)**

The text explains that the term "Pari-naamik" refers to the transformation of a substance. This transformation can occur in various ways, such as the change in the state of karma or the evolution of the soul.

**Conclusion**

The text provides a detailed explanation of the different states and types of karma, as well as the role of non-living substances in the Jain worldview. It emphasizes the importance of understanding karma and its impact on the soul's journey towards liberation.

In the work of becoming, the sky-like body (ākāśastikāya) is involved in the work of giving space, and time (kāla) is involved in the work of self-work, which is transformed by Yama and other times. Again, there are two aspects: Pariṇāmik and Audayik.  

The atom (paramāṇu) only has the Pariṇāmik aspect, but the skandha (skandha) has both Pariṇāmik and Audayik aspects.  

Among the skandhas, the skandhas like ghanu (dense) are only Pariṇāmik, but the skandhas like audārik (spiritual) and śarīrarūpa (body-form) have both Pariṇāmik and Audayik aspects. This is because they are constantly transforming in their own form, making them Pariṇāmik, and because they are born from the rise of audārik and śarīrarūpa, making them Audayik.

The two aspects of pudravy (pudravy) should be understood as different from the karma-puṅgala (karma-puṅgala). The karma-puṅgala has five aspects: aupaśamik (temporary), etc., as explained above.

**Meaning:** In the Gunasthānas (stages of spiritual progress) starting from Sammādi (right faith), there are four aspects. In the Uparāmak (ninth and tenth) and Upashānta (eleventh) Gunasthānas, there are four or five aspects. The four aspects are kṣīma (diminishing), apūrva (previous), prayaḥ (effort), and the remaining Gunasthānas for one jīva.

**In the Karan-Gunasthan, there are four Bhavas, and in all the remaining Gunasthanas, there are three Bhavas.** ||7||

**Meaning:** In the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh Gunasthanas, there are three or four Bhavas. These three Bhavas are: (1) **Shreevayika:** - Manushya-Pravritti etc.; (2) **Parinaamika:** - Shreevatva etc.; (3) **Kshayopa-Shamiya:** - Bhavaindriya, Sampatti etc. These three Bhavas are found at the time of Kshayopa-Shamiya Samyaktv. But if the Samyaktv is Japat-Kshayika or Aupashmika, then one should understand four Bhavas: the said three and one of the two Samyaktv - Japat-Kshayika or Aupashmika.

In the ninth, tenth, and eleventh Gunasthanas, there are four or five Bhavas. Four Bhavas are found when the Samyaktv is Aupashmika and the person is Kshayopa-Shamiya. The three Bhavas are the same as before, and the fourth is Aupashmika-Samyaktv or Charitra. In the tenth, the fifth Bhava is Japat-Kshayika-Samyaktv, and in the eleventh, it is Aupashmika-Charitra.

In the twelfth and thirteenth Gunasthanas, there are four Bhavas. In the twelfth, the four Bhavas are the said three and one of the two Samyaktv - Aupashmika or Japat-Kshayika. In the thirteenth, the four Bhavas are the said three and Shamiya-Samyaktv and Japat-Kshayika-Charitra.

In the remaining five (first, second, third, fourteenth, and fifteenth) Gunasthanas, there are three Bhavas. In the first, second, and third Gunasthanas, the three Bhavas are: Shreevayika: - Manushya-Pravritti; Parinaamika: - Jeevasvabhaava etc.; and Kshayopa-Shamiya: - Bhavaindriya etc. In the fourteenth and fifteenth Gunasthanas, the three Bhavas are: Shreevayika: - Manushya-Pravritti; Parinaamika: - Jeevasvabhaava; and Kshayika: - Chaan-Praapti. ||70||

##  Number Considerations

**(12) - Number Considerations**

**(dwr marià 1] Types of Numbers**

**Karma-Mana-Bhar**

There are three types of *asankhyata* (innumerable): (1) *parish* (pertaining to the periphery), (2) *yukta* (combined), and (3) *nijapadayukta* (having its own position). Similarly, there are three types of *ananta* (infinite). All of these have three sub-types: *jayamya* (inferior), *madhyama* (intermediate), and *utkrista* (superior). || 71 ||

**Meaning:** There is one type of *sankhyata* (countable). There are three types of *asankhyata*, and three types of *ananta*. Thus, there are a total of seven types of numbers. Each type has three sub-types: *jayamya*, *madhyama*, and *utkrista*. || 71 ||

**Explanation:**  There are three types of *samstha* (assemblies) in the scriptures: (1) *sadhya* (achievable), (2) *asankhyata*, and (3) *shramanta* (exhausted). There is one type of *sankhyata*, three types of *asankhyata*, and three types of *ananta*. Thus, there are a total of seven types of numbers. Each type has three sub-types: *jayamya*, *madhyama*, and *utkrista*. 

**Note:**  Number considerations are discussed in the *Anuyogadwar* from verses 234 to 241, and in the *Lokaprakara* from verses 112 to 122. The *Anuyogadwar* Sutra presents a theoretical perspective. The commentary by Shrimadrasurishvara provides further details. The *Lokaprakasha* incorporates both perspectives.

Shri Nemichandra Siddhanta's *Trilokasara* discusses number considerations in verses 13 to 51. The term "kund" is used in the context of "pampa sthana" (a specific location). There are also some related terms. This usage aligns with the *Pambika* commentary.

The term "samstha" is found in Jain literature, and it refers to a number that is slightly larger than one. For further information, refer to the Pali-English dictionary, page 51. 

Page #280:

## Kamaath - Part Four
**20.**

There are twenty types of numbers. They are as follows: (1) Jghanya Sankhyat, (2) Madhyama Sankhyat, and (3) Utkrishta Sankhyat. (4) Jghanya Pariksha Sankhyat, (5) Madhyama Pariksha Sankhyat, and (6) Utkrishta Pariksha Sankhyat. (7) Jghanya Yuka Sankhyat, (8) Madhyama Yuka Sankhyat, and (9) Utkrishta Yuka Sankhyat. (10) Jghanya Asankhyata Sankhyat, (11) Madhyama Asankhyata Sankhyat, and (12) Utkrishta Asankhyata Sankhyat. (13) Jghanya Parikshanant, (14) Madhyama Parikshanant, and (15) Utkrishta Parikshanant. (16) Jghanya Yuktanant, (17) Madhyama Yuktanant, and (18) Utkrishta Yuktanant. (19) Jghanya Anantanant, (20) Madhyama Anantanant, and (21) Utkrishta Anantanant. ||71||

Chhaghu Sankhyeyam Vishaitaha Param Madhyamanthu Yavadgur Kam. Kambhapapramakachatuspasyaprarupanyedam. ||73||

**Meaning:** The smallest number is Jghanya Sankhyat. From there, all the numbers up to Utkrishta Sankhyat are Madhyama Sankhyat. The nature of Utkrishta Sankhyat is known from the description of the Jambudvipa-pramaan Palya. ||2||

**Meaning:** The meaning of Sankhyat is difference (distinction). That which is perceived as different is Sankhyat. One is not perceived as different. Therefore, even though it is the smallest, one is called Jghanya Sankhyat. The perception of difference occurs in two. Therefore, two is called Jghanya Sankhyat. The perception of difference occurs in three. Therefore, three is called...

## Karmagrantha Part Four

All numbers between the two numbers are considered medium numbers. In the scriptures, there is a concept of "Palyauki" to understand the nature of the "Utkrishta Sampaatka". This is shown in the "Ayali Gaapami".

**Names and Measurements of Palyauki:**

* Pahaana Vahiyasala, Ga-Padisala, Ga-Mahaasala, Gakka
* Jaayana Sahamogaadha, Saveshta, Sasihbhariya ||73||
* Pakshya, Anayasthita Shala, Kaamatashala, Kaamadaashala, Akhya
* Yojanasala, Yagada, Svedikaasa, Sajilbhruta ||7||

There are four types of Palyauki: (1) Manavastthita, (2) Shalaaka, (3) Prati Shalaaka, and (4) Maha Shalaaka. All four Palyauki are considered to be one thousand Yojan deep and seven and a half Yojan high, reaching the "Amuneeshki Power Dhedhika". They should be filled with mustard seeds up to the "Shikha". ||3||

**Meaning:**

In the scriptures, there are two types of concepts: "Sat" (truth) and "Asat" (untruth). The concept that leads to action is "Satkalpana", and the concept that is only useful for understanding the nature of an object but does not lead to action is "Asatkalpana". The purpose of "Asatkalpana" is to understand the nature of "Utkrishta Sampaatka".

The four types of Palyauki mentioned are: (1) Manavastthita, (2) Shalaaka, (3) Prati Shalaaka, and (4) Maha Shalaaka. Their length and width are one lakh Yojan each, their depth is one thousand Yojan, and their height is seven and a half Yojan, reaching the "Padmapar Bedika". The depth and height of the Palyauki should be understood from the level of the ground. In summary, these "Kashit Palyauki" are considered to be 100 Yojan in size.

## Karmagrantha Part Four

Many **Anvastthitpatya** are formed. Their length and breadth are not the same. The first **Anvastthit** (**Mulanvastthit**) has a length and breadth of a lakh yojanas. The length and breadth of the subsequent **Anvastthit** (**Uttaramandh sthit**) is increasingly larger. For example:

Imagine filling the **Dhanavastthit** **Patya** the size of Jambudvipa with mustard seeds. Then, from Jambudvipa to each subsequent island and ocean, take one mustard seed from the previous one and place it in the next. Continue this process until the **Mulanvastthit** **Patya** is empty in a particular island or ocean. Then, create a **Patya** the size of that island or ocean from Jambudvipa (the original location). This is the first **Uttaranvastthit**.

Now, take one mustard seed from this **Patya** and place it in each subsequent island and ocean. Continue this process until all the mustard seeds from the first **Uttaranvastthit** **Patya** are exhausted in a particular island or ocean. Then, create another **Patya** from the original location (Jambudvipa) to that island or ocean where the mustard seeds were exhausted. This is the second **Uttaranvastthit** **Patya**.

Fill this **Patya** with mustard seeds and place one seed in each subsequent island and ocean. When the mustard seeds from the second **Uttaranvastthit** **Patya** are exhausted in a particular island or ocean, create another **Patya** from the original location to that island or ocean. This is the third **Uttaranvastthit** **Patya**.

Continue this process of filling the **Patya** with mustard seeds, placing one seed in each subsequent island and ocean, and then creating a new **Patya** from the original location to the point where the seeds are exhausted. This process continues for as many **Uttaranvastthit** **Patya** as are created.

Kamgramp Part Four
All these proofs are progressively larger than the previous ones. Due to the uncertainty of their size, these palya have been named 'Bhagavastthit'. It should be noted that even though the Kamvastthitpalya are indefinite in width and length, they are considered to be fixed in height, with a limit of 100 yojanas.
Where should the Amavastthitpalya be made? This will be revealed by the following verses.
When each Amavastthitpalya is filled, one sarpa is placed in a Shalaikapalya. In other words, the number of sarpas placed in the Shalaikapalya indicates the number of times the Amavastthitpalya was filled.

The Jambudvipa and all other islands and oceans should be filled in this way. In this way, one by one, all the sarpas (snakes) should be placed in the island or ocean where the original sarpa was located, leaving it completely empty. From Jambudvipa (the original location) to this sarpa-ending island or ocean, a long and wide new path should be built, which should be the same height as the previous path. Then this newly built path should be filled with all the sarpas, and one by one, each sarpa should be placed in the next island or ocean. In this way, when this path is also emptied by removing one by one all the sarpas, a sarpa shalaka (marker) should be placed in the path indicating that the first newly built path has become empty. In the island or ocean where the first newly built path becomes empty, a wide newly built path should be built again from the original location (Jambudvipa) to that island or ocean, and it should be filled with sarpas and one by one, each sarpa should be placed in the next island or ocean. When it becomes completely empty, a sarpa shalaka should be placed in the ending path. In this way, in the island or ocean where the last sarpa is placed, a wide newly built path should be built from the original location to that sarpa-ending island or ocean, and it should be filled with sarpas and emptied according to the above method. When each newly built path becomes empty, a sarpa shalaka should be placed in the path. When the shalaka path becomes full of sarpas, a newly built path should be built from the original location to the location of the last sarpa, and it should be filled with sarpas. By this, the asthi path and the shalaka path have now been filled with sarpas. From these two, the shalaka path should be removed, and one by one, each sarpa from it should be placed in the next island or ocean according to the above method. One

When all the sarvas are removed from the shalaakapalya and it is completely empty, we should put one sarva from the pratisalaakapalya into the shalaakapalya. 

**H**

"The shalaakapalya is empty and one sarva is in the pratisalaakapalya. 

After this, we should put one sarva from the anvasthitapanya into the dvipa samudra and empty it. Then, we should put the evidence of its being empty into the shalaakapalya, which is now empty, just like we did before. In this way, we should create new anvasthitapanya from the original place to the place where the last sarva was placed, and fill it with sarvas. Then, we should empty it according to the aforementioned method. And, we should put one sarva into the shalaakapalya for each anvasthitapanya that is emptied. By doing this, the shalaakapalya will be filled with sarvas again. Then, we should create an anvasthitapanya from the original place to the place where the last sarva was placed and fill it with sarvas. Now, the anvasthitapanya and shalaakapalya are both full, and there is one sarva in the pratisalaakapalya.

We should empty the shalaakapalya again according to the previous method. When it is empty, we should put one sarva into the pratisalaakapalya. Now, the pratisalaakapalya is full, the shalaakapalya is empty, and there are two sarvas in the pratisalaakapalya.

Next, we should empty the anvasthitapanya according to the aforementioned method and put one sarva into the shalaakapalya. In this way, we should fill the shalaakapalya repeatedly according to the aforementioned method..."

The **Karmagranya Bhaga** portion should be completed. 
According to the **Anusara Jali**, after the **Pava Bali** is performed, one should place one **Sarva** in each **Pratima Kapalya**. 
The **Matita Kapalya** that was filled with **Sarva** during childhood should also be emptied, and according to the **Tabak** process, the **Amarasthita Pasyadvara** should be filled with **Shana Kapasva** and the **Namavasthita Palya** should also be emptied. 
Until now, the **Anasthita**, **Ekhaaka**, and **Prati Shalaaka** have all been emptied. 
We should take the **Prati Shalaaka** and place one **Sarva** behind it, and then place it in the **Dwipa-Samudra** in the **Bakha**. 
After the **Pravisha Nakara Lyarekhaali** is completed, one **Varsha** should be placed in the **Maha Shalaaka Palya**, which is an indicator of the completion of the **Prati Yata Kapasya**. 
Until now, the **Anasthita** and **Shalaaka Palya** have been filled, and there are six **Pravisha Khaka Palya** as witnesses, and one **Varsha** is placed in the **Maha Shalaaka Palya**. 
After this, the **Shalaaka Palya** should be emptied and all the **Sarva** should be placed in the **Mati Malaaka Palya**, and the **Malaya Asthita Palya** should be emptied and one **Sarva** should be placed in the **Shalaaka Pasyadvara**. 
In this way, a new **Manavasthita Palya** should be created, filled with **Sarva**, and then emptied according to the **Vidhik** process, and one **Sagavara** should be placed in each **Shakaaka Palya**. 
After each **Shalaaka Palya** is emptied, one **Sarva** should be placed in the **Prati Shalaaka Palya**. 
After the **Prati Shalaaka Palya** is filled, it should be emptied and the **Shalaaka Palya** should be filled by the **Anasthita**, and the **Prans** should also be filled with the **Anasthita Palya**. 
Until now, the first three **Palya** have been filled, and the fourth one has one **Varsha**. 
Then the **Prati Shalaaka Palya** should be emptied in the same way, and one **Sarva** should be placed in the **Maha Shalaaka Palya**. 
Until now, the first two **Palya** are full, the **Prati Shalaaka Palya** is empty, and there are two **Sarva** in the **Maha Yata Kapalya**. 
In this way, the **Maha Shalaaka** should be filled by the **Prati Shalaaka**.

When, at the time of the emptying of the previous previous palya, one sarvap is placed in each, then the fourth, third, and second palya should be filled with the unestablished palya, which should be made long and wide from the original place to the island or sea with the most sarvap. In this order, it is filled with the four palya sarvap.

The use of all perfect palya. Padmatinluria Vishadhi Pallach Usarisva Ya. Samvo Vi Egarati. Ruvani Paramasankhijjam. || 77 ||

**77**

The islands and oceans raised from the first three palya, with four sarvap in each palya. Sakarashee, Rumaan Paramasankhyeyam. || 77 ||

**Meaning:**

The number of islands and oceans in which one sarvap has been placed, after the three palya have been emptied, is one less than the number obtained by adding the number of these islands and oceans to the number of sarvap in the four perfect palya. || 77 ||

**Meaning:**

The method described above for repeatedly filling and emptying the unestablished, galaka, and pratisalama palya, should be followed. The number of islands and oceans in which one sarvap is placed, is one less than the number obtained by adding the number of all these islands and oceans to the number of sarvap filled in the four palya.

All numbers between the highest and lowest numbers should be considered as medium numbers. Wherever the word "sankhyat" is used in the scriptures, it refers to the medium number. || 77 ||

## Chapter Four of the Karma Granth: The Nature of the Innumerable and the Infinite [From the Bo Gathas]

218.
We perceive the innumerable as a heap of grains. The innumerable is small, the measure of an Avalika time. [78]
The innumerable with form is small, the measure of an Avalika time, when examined. The innumerable with form is small, the measure of an Avalika time. [7]

**Meaning:** The excellent form is certainly examined and counted. By practicing the examination and counting of the inferior, the inferior becomes counted. The inferior counted is the result of the times of an Avalika. [7]

**Explanation:** By adding one number to the excellent counted, the inferior examined and counted is obtained. That is, the total number of the islands and oceans with one Sarvap on each, and the four-footed Sarvaps combined, is the examined and counted.

**Note:**

1. In Digambar scriptures, the word "rupa" is also used in the sense of a number. For example: the 107th and 110th Gathas of the Jivand, and the commentary on the 74th Gatha of the Pravachana Sara-Shayadhikar.
2. To practice a number, write its digits as many times as the number itself, and multiply them together. That is, multiply the first digit by the second, and then multiply the result by the third digit, and so on. The final product is the practice of the desired number. For example, the practice of 5 is 1125. The method is as follows: Write 5 five times: 5 5 5 5 5. Multiply the first 5 by the second 5 to get 25. Multiply 25 by the third 5 to get 125. Multiply 125 by the fourth 5 to get 625. Multiply 625 by the fifth 5 to get 3125. - Anuyogadwar-Tika, p. 316. 

Page #290:

## Karmagrantha Marg Char 216

The term "Jghanya Yuktasankhyat" is used in the scriptures. It refers to the time of Aavlika, which is considered "Asankhyat" (innumerable). It should be understood as "Jghanya Yuktasankhyat".  

These "Jghanya Yuktasankhyat" should not be considered as "Utkrisht Parikshasankhyat" (excellent examination number), "Jghanya Parikshasankhyat" (inferior examination number), or any number between them. They should be considered as "Madhyam Parikshasankhyat" (medium examination number). || 78 ||

**Vitichoupanchamagunane, Kama Sagasankh Padhamchausatta. Nantar Te Ruvayuya, Majsa Rukun Guru Paccha. || 76 ||**

**Dvitiyatrikayachatumaganaka Santa Anantaaste Rupayuta Madhya Rupota Guravaha Paschat. || 36 ||**

**Meaning:**  In the second, third, fourth, and fifth root-meditations, there are seven "Asankhyat" (innumerable) and one "Khaya" (lost) followed by seven "Ananta" (infinite) in sequence. When combined, these numbers become "Madhyam Sankhya" (medium number). When one number is subtracted, they become "Utkrisht Sankhya" (excellent number). || 76 ||

**Bhavarth:** The previous verse explained the four types of "Asankhyat". Now, the remaining types of "Asankhyat" and all types of "Ananta" are described.

The root-meditations of "Asankhyat" and "Ananta" are six in number, originating from the Jina. They are: (1) Parotasat, (2) Asankhyatasankhyat, (3) Parikshasankhyat, (4) Parikshananta, (5) Suskasankhyat, and (6) Anantananta.

By differentiating the three types of "Asankhyat" into "Jghanya" (inferior), "Madhyam" (medium), and "Utkrisht" (excellent), and similarly for "Ananta", we get the types of "Yuktasankhyat" as shown in the 71st verse.

**From the six original Mevas, the second, Yukta-Samkhyat, when practiced, results in the seventh of the nine Uttar Mevas, Asansthata, which is the lowest Asankhyata-Samkhyat. Subtracting one from the lowest Asankhyata-Samkhyat results in the higher Uttar Meva, Utkrishta Yukta-Samkhyat. All the numbers between the lowest Yukta-Samkhyat and the highest Yukta-Samkhyat are Madhyama Yukta-Samkhyat.**

All the numbers between the lowest Parikshananta and the highest Parikshananta are Madhyama Parikshananta.**

**From the five original Mevas, the fifth, Yukta-Ananta, when practiced, results in the seventh of the infinite Uttar Mevas, Ananta, which is the lowest Ananta-Ananta. Subtracting one from the lowest Ananta-Ananta results in the higher Uttar Meva, Utkrishta Yukta-Ananta. All the numbers between the lowest Yukta-Ananta and the highest Yukta-Ananta are Madhyama Yukta-Ananta. All the numbers beyond Ananta-Ananta are Madhyama Ananta-Ananta; because according to the Siddhanta, there is no Utkrishta Ananta-Ananta.**

## Translation:

**222**

**6.**  In that, the revived infinite-infinite is small, and that too thrice. Even so, O friend, do not throw the infinite-infinite six times.

**85.**  The Siddhas, the Nigoda-jiva, the plants, the Kalapudgala, and all the Lokanabha, having gone thrice, become the Kevala-dvi.

**86.**  When the infinite-infinite is thrown, the greatest is obtained, but the middle is used. Thus, the subtle meaning is explained by Devendrasuri.

**80.**  As per the sutra, the opinion has been stated. Now, the opinion of other Acharyas is stated. By multiplying the least innumerable by itself four times, the least innumerable is obtained. By adding one to the least innumerable, the middle innumerable is obtained.

**80.**  By subtracting one from the least innumerable, the previous Guru, i.e., the excellent innumerable, is obtained. Multiply the least innumerable by itself three times and write it as "ten" innumerable.

**1.**  To multiply a number by itself three times, square the number, then square the square, and then square the square of the square. For example, to multiply 5 by itself three times, square 5 to get 25, square 25 to get 625, and square 625 to get 390625. This is 5 multiplied by itself three times.

**2.**  The Lokakasha, Dharma-astikaya, and the four regions are all equal to the innumerable-innumerable.

**Adharma-astikaya** and one Jiva,

**Jnanavaraniya** etc., each karma has innumerable distinctions from the least to the greatest, due to the difference in time. For example, the least state of Jnanavaraniya is the Antarmukhurta measure, and the greatest state is the thirty Koti-koti Sagaropama measure. From Antarmukhurta, one time more is two times, three times more is three times, and so on, increasing by one time each time, until one time less than thirty Koti-koti Sagaropama, all these states are middle. Antarmukhurta and the head...

## Karmagrantha Part, Chapter 223

**223 Numbers to be included in it:** (1) The regions of Lokakasha, (2) Between Dharmaastisagaropama, there is the effect of countless times. Therefore, even though the Agny and Utkrishta states are of one type, there are countless varieties of the Gnanavaraneya state due to the inclusion of the middle states. The same should be understood regarding the state of other karmas. The number of Adhyavasyas that are the cause of each state is equal to countless Lokakasha regions. "Paitiisankhalogasama." - A. 55, Pancham Karmagrantha by Devendrasur. In this place, the number of all state-binding Adhyavasyas is intended.

**Anubhag** means the result of Kashayik, which is the cause of Rasa. Kashayik result means countless varieties of Adhyavasyas in the form of Teev, Teevratar, Teeasama, Mand, Mandatar, Mandtama, etc. Each Anubhag-sthan is bound by each Kashayik result because the Rasa-samparthakas of the Karma Paramanus taken by one Kashayik result are called Anubhag-bandha in the scriptures. See the 31st verse of Kammapatti, commentary by Shriyasovijayaji. Therefore, the Anubhag-sthan born from Kashayik result is also equal to Kashayik result, i.e., countless. In this context, it should be known that there are countless Anubhag-sthans in each state-binding. Because there are as many Adhyavasyas as there are Anubhag-sthans, and in each state-binding, the Adhyavasyas that are the cause are countless Lokakasha region-proof.

**Yoga** has countless **nivibhag anshas**. The part that cannot be divided even by knowledge is called **nivibhag ansha**. In this place, the **nivibhag anshas** related to **mog** of all beings from **nigod** to **sanshi** are included.

**Pratyek sharee** is the body whose owner is one being. **Pratyek sharee** is countless. Because from Prithvi Kayik to Usakayik, all types of **Pratyek** beings combined are countless.

**Nigod sharee** is the body that is held by countless beings. Such **nigod sharee** is countless.

## Karmagranth Part Four

**(3) The realm of Adharmastikaya, (4) The realm of Ekpadiya, (5) The realm of Rithithi, (6) The realm of Andha-janaka Adhyavasaya, (7) The realm of Anumana Vishesh, (8) The realm of Yoga Nirvibhaga Ansh, (9) The realm of Avasarpini and Utsarpini, (10) The realm of each body and (11) The realm of Nigovasharira.**

**||12||**

Add the above mentioned numbers and then square the sum. By squaring, you get Jghanya Parisanant. By practicing Jghanya Parisanant, you get Jghanya Yuktanashta. This is the measure of the living beings. **||3||**

**(2) Kanik Jiva**

**1**

By squaring Jghanya Yuktanashta, you get Jghanya Anantanant. Square Jghanya Anantanant three times. But even after that, it does not become Utkshta Anantanant. Therefore, after squaring three times, add the following six infinite numbers: **(1) Siddha, (2) Three times the time of the three kalas, (3) The total number of Pudgal-Paramanu, (4) Time, (5) Space, and (6) The entry of the space.**

Add these six infinite numbers and then square the sum three times. Then add the number of the K-Paryayas. In the scriptures, Anantanant is used, but it refers to Madhyama Anantanant, not Jghanya or Utkshta Anantanant. This section, called "Sookshmarthe Vichar", was written by Shri Devendra Bhuri. **||65||86||**

**Meaning:**

From verse 71 to 76, the description of numbers is given according to the Sangyatik Mat. Now, according to the Karmagranthik Mat, the description is given. There is no difference of opinion between the Saiddhantic and Karmagranthik Acharyas regarding the nature of the first seven bhevas out of the twenty-one bhevas. There is a difference of opinion regarding the nature of the remaining bhevas.

**1.** The word "Alok" in the original text refers to both Lok and Alok.

**2.** Since the number of Jneyaparyayas is infinite, the number of Gyanaparyayas is also infinite.

## Karma Granth Part Four

The **Jghanya Asankhyata** is obtained by squaring the **Kama Prabhvika Afkai Ki Jayaka** class. Then, multiply this number by three and add the aforementioned **Asankhyata** numbers like **Lokaakash-Pradesh** etc. Then, square the result three times. The number obtained after this squaring is called **Anyat Paritaananta**.

**225**

By practicing **Jghanya Paritaananta**, we get **Jghanya Yuktaanams**. The scriptures state that **Amchya Jeevas** are infinite, so they are considered **Jghanya Yuktaanams**.

By squaring **Adhamya Yuktaanams** once, we get **Jghanya Anantaanams**. Then, square **Jghanya Anantaanams** three times and add the aforementioned six numbers like **Siddh** etc. Then, square the result three times and add the total number of **Kevalashan** and **Kevaldarshan** categories. The number obtained after this addition is called **Utkrisht Anantaanams**.

Regarding the nature of **Madhyama** or **Utkrisht** numbers, there is no difference of opinion between **Sanyantik** and **Karmgraanthik** schools. However, according to the 76th and 10th verses, the nature of **Jghanya Asankhyata** differs based on these two schools. According to the **Siddhantic** school, practicing **Jghanya Yukta** results in **Jghanya Asankhyata** as the form, while according to the **Karmgraanthik** school, squaring **Jghanya Yukta** results in **Jghanya Asankhyata**. Therefore, the nature of **Madhyama Mushya Asankhyata**, **Utkrisht Yukta Asankhyata**, and all subsequent **Madhyama** and **Utkrisht** numbers becomes mixed.

By subtracting one from **Sthala Asankhyata**, we get **Utkrisht Jghanya Yukta Asankhyata**. All numbers between **Utkrisht Jghanya Yukta Asankhyata** and **Utkrisht Yukta Asankhyata** are...

Karma is like a middle number. Just as a middle number is formed by subtracting one from a higher number and adding one to a lower number, so too are the middle numbers between the lowest and highest numbers of a category.

All the lowest and all the highest numbers are of one type each; but the middle numbers are not of one type. There are countless differences in the middle numbers, countless differences in the middle innumerable, and countless differences in the middle infinite, because the lowest or highest number refers to a fixed number, but this is not the case with the middle number. There are units between the lowest and highest numbers, there are infinitesimal units between the lowest and highest innumerable, and there are infinite units between the lowest and highest infinite, which are called 'middle number', 'middle innumerable', and 'middle infinite' respectively.

Wherever the term 'infinite' is used in the scriptures, it always refers to the 'middle infinite'.

The author of this section calls it "Sukshmartham Vichar" because it discusses many subtle topics.

Appendix to Vritiyadhikar.
Appendix "P"
Page 176, Line 1. On 'Mula Bandha-Hetu'
This topic is in Panchasangraha Dva. 4, verses 16 and 20, but there is some difference in its description compared to Maha. In it, the bondage of sixteen Prakruti is said to be Mithyatva-Hetuk, the bondage of thirty-five Prakruti is said to be Aviriti-Hetuk, the bondage of sixty-eight Prakruti is said to be Kashaya-Hetuk, and the bondage of seven Vedaniya is said to be Yoga-Hetuk. This explanation is done taking into account Anvaya-Vyatireka, Ubhayamaulak Kaya-Karana-Bhaavako, like - in the presence of Mithyatva, there is bondage of sixteen, and in its absence, there is absence of bondage of sixteen, therefore, the bondage of sixteen can occur along with Mithyatva in Anvaya-Vyatireka. Similarly, the bondage of thirty-five should be understood as Vyatireka with Aviriti, the bondage of sixty-eight with Kashaya, and the bondage of seven Vedaniya with Yoga.
But here, only Anvaya Mulak Karya-Karana-Bhaavako is taken into account while describing the bondage, Vyatireka is not intended. Therefore, the description here seems different from the description in Panchasangraha. Anvaya - like, at the time of Mithyatva, at the time of Aviriti, at the time of Kashaya, and at the time of Yoga, the bondage of seven Vedaniya definitely occurs, similarly, at the time of Mithyatva, the bondage of sixteen, at the time of Mithyatva and Aviriti, the bondage of thirty-five, and at the time of Mithyatva, Aviriti, and Kashaya, the bondage of sixty-eight Prakruti definitely occurs. Keeping this Anvaya-Abhava in mind, Shridevendrasuri has called the bondage of one, sixteen, thirty-five, and sixty-eight as Chaturhettuk, Ek-Hetuk, Dvi-Hetuk, and Tri-Hetuk respectively. The Vyatireka of the above four bondages can only be matched with one Hetu each, according to the description in Panchasangraha. There is a difference in the style of description in Panchasangraha and here, but not in the meaning.

## Karmagrantha, Part, Appendix "F", Page 206, Line 14, "Mal Mab"

This verse, like the one in the Pancha-Sangraha, lists the number of one-soul-dependent states in the Gunasthanas. However, there is a slight difference in the explanation between the commentary and the Tika-Tava of this verse and the commentary of the corresponding verse in the Pancha-Sangraha.

The Tika-Tava uses the terms "Upshamka" and "Jekanss" to include the ninth, tenth, and eleventh Gunasthanas, and the term "Apuurva" to include only the eighth Gunasthan. In the ninth Gunasthan, the "Upshamka" is considered to be the "Palambaka" or the "Savyaktvi" or the "Kshayikambhyavtvi". In the eighth Gunasthan, the "Upshamka" or "Kshayik" is not considered to be the "Samyaktyamale" but the "Kshayopshamaka". This is evident from the separate use of the term "Apuurva" in the verse. If the eighth Gunasthan also had the "Upshamka" as the "Charitra", then the term "Apuurva" would not have been used separately, and the eighth Gunasthan would have been included with the ninth and subsequent Gunasthanas using the term "Upshamka". The Tika-Tava does not mention the "Charitra" or the "Mab" related to the "Apakni-gat-jeeva" in the ninth and tenth Gunasthanas.

The commentary of the Pancha-Sangraha, by Shri Malgirin, uses the terms "Upshamka" and "Upshanta" to include the eighth to eleventh Gunasthanas, which are the "Upsham" श्रेणी, and the terms "Apuurva" and "Shreen" to include the eighth, ninth, tenth, and twelfth Gunasthanas, which are the "Kshapaka" श्रेणी. He considers the "Upshamka" as the "Charitra" in the aforementioned four Gunasthanas, but does not mention anything about the "Charitra" in the four Gunasthanas of the "Kshapaka" श्रेणी. In the eleventh Gunasthan, there is only the "Upshamka" "Charitra" because all the "Mohaniya" are completely "Upsham". In the ninth and tenth Gunasthanas, there are two "Charitras", "Upshamka" and "Kshayopshamaka", because some of the "Charitra-Mohaniya" are "Upshanta" in these two Gunasthanas, but not all. Compared to the "Upshanta" nature, the "Upshamka" ...

Expectation
Understanding Pari
And Anupashant Nature is Required. Although this has not been explicitly stated, but by looking at the commentary of the 25th verse of Panch. Dva. 3, there is nothing left in this matter, because in it, the subtle Samprayacha Rikko, which occurs only in the tenth Gunasthan, has been called Kshayopaśamik.
330
Due to the beginning of the Charitra Mohaniya Upashama or the subsidence of some natures in the eighth, ninth and tenth Gunasthan by the Upashama Shreni, it is considered as Panchasangrah Tika like Orashamivarit, in the same way, there is no contradiction in considering Kshayikcharitra in the eighth, ninth and tenth Gunasthan by the Kshapaka Shreni, due to the beginning of the destruction of Charitra Mohaniya or the destruction of some natures.
In Gommatsar, Charitra Opashamik has been considered in the eighth and the next four Gunasthan by the Upashama Shreni and Kshayopaśamik has been explicitly prohibited. Similarly, in the four Gunasthan by the Kshapaka Shreni, Kshayikcharitra has been considered and Kshayopaśamik has been prohibited. This becomes clear by looking at the 845th and 646th verses of Karmakanda.

## Karmagrantha Part Four, Appendix, Page 207, Line 3

This discussion on the 'Bhavarsha' rule is about the emotions found in a being during the intended time of its existence.

The emotions found in a being at different times, and the emotions found in many beings at the same time or at different times, are written about in this context. In the first three Gunasthanas, there are three emotions: Audayik, Kshayopa-shaamik, and Pari-naamik. These three emotions are found in the eight Gunasthanas from the fourth to the eleventh. In the twelfth Gunasthana, there are four emotions except for the Upshaamik. In the thirteenth and fourteenth Gunasthanas, there are three emotions except for the Upshaamik and Kshayopa-shaamik.

**Differences in emotions in Gunasthanas in relation to many beings:**

* **Upshaamik:** In the first two Gunasthanas, there are three Ajnan, two Darshan, five Labdhis, totaling 10. In the third, there are three Jnans, three Darshan, Mishrashakti, five Labdhis, totaling 12. In the fourth, there are 12 like the third Gunasthana, but with Samyaktva in place of Mishrashakti. In the fifth, there are 12 like the fourth Gunasthana, plus Desh-viriti, totaling 13. In the sixth and seventh, there are 14, with Desh-viriti removed from the previous 13 and replaced with Sarva-viriti and Manah-paryavgyan. In the eighth, ninth, and tenth Gunasthanas, there are 13, with Samyaktva removed from the previous 14. In the eleventh and twelfth Gunasthanas, there are 12, with Barishra removed from the previous 13. There are no Kshayopa-shaamik emotions in the thirteenth and fourteenth Gunasthanas.

* **Audayik:** In the first Gunasthana, there are 21, including Ajnan. In the second, there are 20, excluding Mithyatva. In the third and fourth, there are 16, excluding Ajnan. In the fifth, there are 17, excluding Devagati and Narakagati from the previous 16. In the sixth, there are 15, excluding Tiryanch-gati and Asan-yam. In the seventh, there are 12, excluding Krishna, etc., three Leshyas from the previous 15. In the eighth and ninth, there are 10, excluding Tejas and 56-lelya. In the tenth, there are 4, excluding Krodha, Mana, Maya, and three Vedas from the previous 10. In the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth Gunasthanas, there are 3, excluding Saval-lobha. In the fourteenth Gunasthana, there are two Audayik emotions: Manushya-gati and Asiddhatva, excluding Shulka-leshya from the previous three.

* **Kshayik:** There are no Kshayik emotions in the first three Gunasthanas. In the eight Gunasthanas from the fourth to the eleventh, there is Sampatti. In the twelfth, there are two: Samyaktva and Charitra. In the thirteenth and fourteenth Gunasthanas, there are no Kshayik emotions.

* **Upshaamik:** There are no Upshaamik emotions in the first three Gunasthanas, and in the three from the twelfth onwards, totaling six Gunasthanas. In the five Gunasthanas from the fourth to the eighth, there is Samyak-karma. 

Page #303:
---------------------------
**Karmagrantha Part Four**

From the ninth to the eleventh **gunaasthanas**, there are three **gunaasthanas** with **mamyaktva** and **charitra**, **greedi** and **aaupshamik** **bhavas**.

**Parinaamik** - In the first **gunaasthana**, there are three **bhavas**: **jivattva**, **bhavya**, and **mamyaktva**. From the second to the twelfth **gunaasthanas**, there are eleven **gunaasthanas** with **jivattva** and **bhavya**. In the thirteenth and fourteenth **gunaasthanas**, only **jivattva** is **parinaamik**. **Bhavya** is **anaadi-saant** because it becomes **amaatra** in the **siddh** state. After the destruction of **ghaatik karma**, the attainment of the **mid** state does not take much time. Therefore, **bhavya** is not considered **purvaacharya** in the thirteenth and fourteenth **gunaasthanas**.

**Gommatsaar** - In the **karmaka** from verses 20 to 75, **sthangat** and **gad-gat** **sanvara bhavas** are described in detail.

**Ek-Jinaathit Bhaavi** - The different types of **kshayopaashamak** **bhavas**:

* In the eleventh and twelfth **gunaasthanas**: all **bhavas** from the tenth **gunaasthana** except **charitra**.

**Audayik** - In the first **gunaasthana**: **agyaan**, **asiddhtva**, **asanyam**, **leshya** (one), **kashay** (one), **gati** (one), **ved** (one), and **mithyaal** (one). In the second **gunaasthana**: all **audyaik** **bhavas** from the first **gunaasthana** except **mithyaatva**. In the third, fourth, and fifth **gunaasthanas**: all **bhavas** from the second **gunaasthana** except **agyaan**. From the sixth to the ninth **gunaasthanas**: all **bhavas** from the fifth **gunaasthana** except **asanyam**. In the tenth **gunaasthana**: all **bhavas** from the ninth **gunaasthana** except **ved**. In the eleventh and twelfth **gunaasthanas**: all **bhavas** from the tenth **gunaasthana** except **kashay**. In the thirteenth **gunaasthana**: **asiddhtva**, **leshya**, and **gati**. In the fourteenth **gunaasthana**: **gati** and **asiddhtva**.

**Saayik** - From the fourth to the eleventh **gunaasthanas**: **samyaktva**. In the second and thirteenth to fourteenth **gunaasthanas**: nine **saayik** **bhavas**.

**Aaupshamik** - From the first to the eighth **gunaasthanas**: **samyaktva**. From the ninth to the eleventh **gunaasthanas**: **samyaktva** and **charitra**.

**Parinaamik** - In the first **gunaasthana**: all three **bhavas**. From the second to the twelfth **gunaasthanas**: **jivattva** and **bhavya**. In the thirteenth and fourteenth **gunaasthanas**: only **jivattva**.

... Appendix No. 11
Some similar and dissimilar views of the Svetambara and Digambara sects.
(a) The interpretation of the weapon of the soul from the perspective of certainty and practice is the same in both sects. Page-4. In this regard, the 'Samaadhikār' chapter of Jīvakāṇḍa and its commentary are worth seeing.
The definition of the word Mārgṇāsthān is the same in both sects. Page-4.
The style of the Gunasthān Rāva in the Karmagranth and the Joṣakāj is similar, but there is no difference in the sāttvika meaning. Page-4.
The nature of use is considered the same in both sects. Page-5.
In the Karmagranth, the incomplete soul is considered to have three Gunasthānas, but in the Gommatasāra, it is considered to have five. Thus, there is a difference in the views of both on the subject of the soul, but it is relative, so in reality, there is similarity. Page-12.
Regarding the Kevalajnani, the practice of samsitva and asamsitva is the same in the scriptures of both sects. Page-13.
The flag-like nature of the Pariira of the Vāyukāya is accepted by both sects. Page-20.

The meaning of the fourteen Mārgaṇās is the same in both the Sampradāya, and the Janaki Mas Gāthās are also the same. Page-47, Note.
The explanation of Samyaktv is the same in both the Sampradāya. Page-50, Note.
Although there are some differences in the explanation, there is no difference in the essence of the nature of food in both the Sampradāya. In the Svetambara Granths, there are always three types of food, and in the Digambara Granths, six types are also found. Page-50, Note.
The age of the person who is eligible for the Parihāra-viśuddha-saṁgha, the knowledge required, the person from whom it can be taken, and the time-limit of the Bihar, etc., are all similar in both the Sampradāya. Page-51, Note 1.
The fact that Māyika-samyaktv is attained by humans in the Jina-kāla is accepted by both the Sampradāya. Page-66, Note.
The relationship of Dravyamāna in the Kevali is accepted by both the Sampradāya. Page-101, Note.

The number of Vigrahas in Chakra Gati is the same in both communities. However, the four Vigrahas mentioned in the Svetambara texts are not found in the Digambara texts. The duration of Bapti is the same in both communities. The duration of Anaharakatva in Chakra Gati is considered from three perspectives: Vyavahar, Nishchay, and Drishti. According to Vyavahar, the Svetambara view is considered, and according to Nishchay, the Digambara view is considered. Therefore, there is no real consensus on this topic between the two communities. (Page 143)

Regarding the number of Gunasthanas in Avadhi Vashan, there are three perspectives: Saiddhantic, Ek, and Kasayadhik. Both the Saiddhantic and Kasayadhik perspectives are found in the Digambara texts. (Page 146)

The acceptance of Aharakatva, the cause of Aharakatva being the rise of Asatavedaniya, and the acceptance of Audarik Pugalas in a Kevalgyani are all accepted by both communities. (Page 148)

The concept of Jeevasthana in Gunasthan appears to be slightly different in Gommatasar compared to the Karma Grantha. However, this difference is relative and essentially the same as the Karma Grantha. (Page 161, Note)

The number of Upayogas in Gunasthan is the same in both the Karma Grantha and Gommatasar. (Page 167, Note)

The term *Nitya Paryapt* is used in the *Vigamya Rashtra* in place of *Karan Paryapt* which is famous in the Swetambar scriptures. Both terms have some similarity.

**Page 43:**
The Swetambar tradition has three aspects: *Kevalgyan*, *Keval Darshan*, and *Samavi Vishva*, while the Digambar tradition has only one aspect: *Sahabharitva*.

**Page 55, Note:**
The four *Chaumaha* and *Bosa* distinctions of *Kashaya* in relation to *Leshya* and *Ayu* are not found in the Swetambar tradition.

**Page 70, Note:**

It is believed that in the Svetambara texts, time is independent and also a raft. But in the Digambara texts, it is considered independent. Even in the independent view, the nature of time is not the same in the texts of both sects. Page - 157.

The number of Yogas in the Gunasthanas is different in the Gommatasar compared to the Karmaprath. Page 163, Note.

There are views in the Svetambara texts that consider knowledge and ignorance at the time of the second Gunasthana. But in the Gommatasar, only the second view is considered. Page - 166, Note.

Regarding the number of Leshyas in the Gunasthanas, there are two views in the Svetambara texts and only one view in the Digambara texts. Page 172, Note.

[The Digambara sect believes that a Jiva, even with Samyaktvavasa, does not die and become a woman. But this view is not acceptable to the Svetambara sect, because they believe that Bhagwan Mahilanath was born as a woman and with Samyaktvavasa.]
