## Harivansha Purana

'Harivansha Purana' is an unparalleled Sanskrit poetic work by Acharya Jinsen (8th century). It beautifully depicts the life story of the 22nd Tirthankara,  Neminath, along with the popular narratives of Krishna, Balabhadra, Krishna's son Pradyumna, and the Pandavas and Kauravas.  Furthermore, this vast text introduces the entire Harivansha, and elaborates on various elements of Jainism and culture in a clear and detailed manner. It is filled with diverse material from Indian culture and history.

'Harivansha Purana' is not merely a story-book, but also a high-quality epic poem. Composed in various meters across sixty-six chapters, this vast text contains approximately eight thousand nine hundred verses. This well-edited text, with the original Sanskrit, Hindi translation, a significant introduction, and numerous appendices, is as useful for lovers of Purana stories as it is for researchers of Indian culture and history.

This is another new edition of the text.

## Editorial
The inspiration for the first edition of this literature is the scenery and events of nature and the experiences of life. Among the various experiences of mankind, the most influential are the characters of those men who have done some special work for the welfare of the people, whether it is related to liberation from suffering or in the form of physical or spiritual excellence. This is evident from the fact that ninety percent of the world's literature is heroic-epic, which depicts some extraordinary superhuman characters, both real and imagined. Just look at Indian literature, where from the Vedas to a small news item about the Chinese war of Kalki, some kind of heroism will be found to be dominant.

- The characters of some great men of the nation have transcended the boundaries of space and time and have become widely popular. The characters of Rama and Krishna are of this kind. They are prominent in Hindu and Jain literature, and countless Puranas, poems, plays and stories have been written based on these names in the last two and a half thousand years. Just as the Ramayana and Mahabharata in the Vedic tradition have proved to be the source of these various literary streams, so too in Jain literature, the Padma Purana or Padmacharita and the Harivansh Purana or Arishtanemi Charita hold a place of importance. Here, our purpose is specifically related to the stories of the Harivansh. In the Ardhamagadhi Agamas, there are many references to the stories of Krishna and the Kauravas and Pandavas. Especially in the sixth Shrutaanga Naayadhammakhaao and the eighth Antagadadasao. The post-Agamic 'Vasudeva Hindi' and other Prakrit texts are also great repositories of stories related to the Harivansh. Much of their description is similar to the Mahabharata, and some is independent. The special thing is that these characters have been adopted in different religions according to their own theoretical and moral traditions.

One may ask why and how these men, considered deities in other religions, gained acceptance in Jainism? The answer is the same as given above. Jainism believes in the worship of heroes. It has addressed its last Tirthankara as Veer and Mahavira. There have been twenty-four such great men who, by the power of penance and knowledge, paved the way for religion and became eligible for the worship of the world as Tirthankaras. There have also been twelve Veer Purushas who established systems of governance by conquering the world and suppressing evil. They attained the position of Chakravarti and became the recipients of public respect. Similarly, nine Balabhadra, nine Narayana and nine Pratinarayana, the enemies of these Narayana, also presented various kinds of ideals in their time through their extraordinary valor. In Jain Puranas, these great men have been sung about in detail and in a more or less artistic way according to the talent and interest of the author in the characters and stories. Rama and Krishna are also counted among these superhuman heroes. Therefore, they also find a respectful place in Jain Puranas.

From the point of view of subject matter, five parts of the Purana are considered in the Vedic tradition - the creation of the universe, its destruction and re-creation, the human lineage, the ages of men and the characters of royal dynasties. Following their own fundamental principles, these features have also been followed in Jain Puranas with appropriate modifications. Jainism considers the universe to be eternal and infinite in its material and conscious form, but its development changes according to the ascending and descending order of the time cycle, going up and down. Therefore, in Jain Puranas, instead of creation and re-creation, this very form of the universe and the ascending and descending form of the time cycle, the description of change and the changes in the world order are given. The lineages, the Manus (Kulakaras) and the lineage stories are also described in these Puranas according to their own tradition. There are hundreds of Jain texts on the subject of Puranas, and they are in Prakrit, Sanskrit, Apabhramsha and...

Page #8:
---------------------------
The Harivamsha Purana is found in all ancient Indian languages like Tamil, Kannada, Hindi, etc. These diverse compositions also exhibit variations in descriptions, which makes a comparative study of them with each other and with the Vedic Puranas a fascinating and important subject.

The Jain Harivamsha Purana, along with the above-mentioned subject matter, particularly describes a branch of the Harivamsa, the Yadava clan, and the characters of two Shalakapurushas born in it. One is the twenty-second Tirthankara, Neminath, and the other is the ninth Narayana Krishna. These two were cousins, one of whom took renunciation on the occasion of his marriage, while the other displayed his strength and skill in the Kuru-Pandava war. One presented the ideal of spiritual excellence, and the other of physical play. One paved the way for renunciation, and the other for involvement. It is in this context that the story of the Mahabharata is found in the Harivamsha Purana.

There are numerous ancient cultural, Prakrit, and Apabhramsha compositions on this subject. In Sanskrit, there are works by Dharmakirti, Shrutakirti, Sakalakirti, Jayasagar, Jindas, and Mangaras under the name Harivamsha Purana, and by Shribhushan, Shubhachandra, Vadiachandra, Jayanand, Vijayagani, Devavijay, Devaprabha, Devabhadra, and Shubhavardhan under the name Pandavapurana; and under the name Neminath Charitra, there are works by Suracharya, Udayaprabha, Kotiraj, Gunavijay, Hemchandra, Bhojasagar, Tilakacharya, Vikram, Narasimha, Harishena, Nemidatta, etc. In Prakrit, there are Puranas and Kavya by Ratnaprabha, Gunavallabha, and Gunasagar, and in Apabhramsha, there are Puranas and Kavya by Swayambhu, Dhaval, Yashaskirti, Shrutakirti, Haribhadra, and Rayadhu (see Velankar's Jinratnakosh and Kochhar's Apabhramsha Sahitya). In addition to these independent compositions, this story is also described in the Sanskrit and Apabhramsha Mahapuranas by Jinsen, Gunabhadra, Hemchandra, and Pushpadanta, and independent ancient copies of it are also found. It is possible that many Sanskrit, Prakrit, and Apabhramsha compositions under the names Harivamsha Purana, Arishtanemi or Nemicharitra, Pandavapurana, and Pandavacharita are still lying unknown in repositories. There are also many works written in ancient Hindi and Kannada. Therefore, the editor of the present work, in his preface on page ten, has mentioned only one Sanskrit and one Apabhramsha composition in addition to the present work, which should not lead to confusion regarding the Jain literary composition on this subject.

In Hindu and Jain traditions, Puranas have been attempted to be made encyclopedias of their respective times. They contain not only stories, but also, according to the context, introduce various arts and sciences in addition to religion and ethics, briefly or in detail. The purpose of this trend appears to be that a devotee who reads a single Purana can obtain all kinds of information related to his tradition. This trend is particularly found in the present Harivamsha Purana. The description of the nature of the three worlds, the life story of Mahavira Tirthankara, Samavasarana, religious teachings, and the art of music, etc., given here, is a complete treatise on those subjects and is worthy of study and dissemination independently.

There is much debate and uncertainty regarding the authorship and time of the Vedic literature, and especially the Puranic compositions. Fortunately, the tendency to date in Jain traditions is often more explicit. Here, clear mentions of the authors and the time of composition of the major Puranas are found. The author of the present Harivamsha Purana has clearly introduced himself as belonging to the Punnat Sangha, his guru's name was Kirtisena, and he completed this composition in Shaka Samvat 705. Not only this, but he is found to be a great poet who, in addition to the universally accepted guru parampara of 683 years from Lord Mahavira, has also given a guru lineage from his time onwards, which is not found anywhere else.

Another important evidence of the unique historical consciousness of the Harivamsha Purana author is available in his composition, which has influenced the knowledge of the history of the entire India of that time. He has...

## Editorial

Along with the completion of his work, the author has also mentioned the places where he composed it. This information is found in the last two verses (66, 52-53) of the text, where he states that the majority of the work was composed while seated in the Parshvanath temple of Vardhamanpur, and the remaining portion was written in the peaceful temple of Shanti Nath, where the people of Dostatika had organized a grand puja. At that time, Indrayudh ruled in the north, Krishna's son Shrivallabh in the south, and the Avanti king Vatsaraj in the east, while Veer Jayavarah ruled in the west and Saurashtra (Solar Mandala). These mentions are very important and have been used by all historians. However, some confusion has arisen regarding certain points. One opinion is that the text mentions Avantiraj Vatsaraj in the east and Veer Jayavarah, the king of Saurashtra, in the west. However, according to another opinion, the text should be understood as mentioning Avantiraj in the east, Vatsaraj and Veer Jayavarah in the west. There is also disagreement about which Vardhamanpur is the midpoint of these kingdoms. Both of us, the chief editors of this series of texts, do not agree on this point. According to Dr. Upadhye, this Vardhamanpur is the present-day Vadhavan in Kathiawar, and it was from this same Punnat Sangha that Harishena, 148 years later, composed the Brihatkatha Kosha in the Saka year 853 (see the introduction to that text, page 121). However, Dr. Hiralal Jain, in one of his articles (Indian Culture, Volume 11, 1944-45, page 161, etc., and Jain Siddhant Bhaskar, 12-2), has attempted to prove that the Vardhamanpur mentioned by Jinesen is the present-day Badnawar in the Dhar district of Madhya Pradesh, as its ancient name is found there, and the ruins of ancient Jain temples still exist there. The village of Dutariya (ancient Dostatika) is located nearby, and the boundaries of the mentioned kingdoms are historically accurate from there. Along with this question, the history of the Punnat Sangha's branch coming from Karnataka and establishing itself in Vardhamanpur, and its existence for at least a century and a half between Jinesen and Harishena, is also worth investigating. Simply mentioning the Sangha's arrival for the Girnar pilgrimage and their stay in Vardhamanpur does not reveal the full significance of this great event. It is possible that the establishment of this Sangha Peeth is related to the increasing dominance of the Rashtrakuta kings, the great patrons of Jainism, in Malwa and Gujarat. According to inscriptions, these regions were brought under the control of the Rashtrakuta king Dantidurga around 750 AD.

In the final verse of the text, this Harivansh Purana is called a Shriparvat, which the poet has taken refuge in for the benefit of enlightenment, and he expresses the hope that this Shriparvat will spread in all directions and become more stable, establishing itself on earth. The question is, what is the significance of the poet comparing his work to Shriparvat? Upon reflection, a significant history of a stream of Indian culture is hidden here. The Shriparvat is mentioned in many places in Buddhist literature. This mention in the Manjusri Mulakalpa (page 88) is particularly noteworthy:

"Shriparvate Mahashaile Dakshinapatha Sanjnake. Shri Dhanyakatake Chaitye Jin Dhatupare Bhuvi. Siddhyante Mantra-Tantras Vai Kshiprm Sarvarth Karmasu."

According to this mention, there is a chaitya on the Mahashail called Shriparvat near Dhanyakatak in Dakshinapatha, where the bones and ashes of Jin (Buddha) are preserved. By practicing there, mantras and tantras become quickly realized, and all desires are fulfilled. Not only in Buddhist literature, but other great Sanskrit poets have also mentioned the fame of Shrishail. For example, the great poet Bana, in his Kadambari story, calls the old Dravidian religious character "Shriparvata Acharya Varta Sahasrabhijna," and in Harshacharita, Harsha himself says, "Sakalpranayimanorathasiddhi Shriparvatah." Bhavabhuti, in his play Malatimadhava, calls the Buddhist nun Soudamini, who is a character in the play, "Shriparvata Acharya Varta Sahasrabhijna."

---------------------------
The Harivansha Purana mentions Padmavati Nagari and its connection to Shripurvat for learning Mantra-Tantra. Similar references abound, proving that Shripurvat became a renowned center for Mantra-Tantra and Siddhis around the 7th century. This fame led some Tibetan texts to claim that Lord Buddha established his Dharmachakra in Dhanayakataka (a city near Shripurvat) (Rahul Sankrityayan's Puratatva-Nibandhavli). Archaeological evidence unearthed at Shripurvat has been conclusively linked to Nagarjunikonda in the Guntur district of modern Andhra Pradesh. This hill is now locally known as Naharallavadu. In light of this historical evidence, there is no doubt that the author of the Harivansha Purana was aware of Shripurvat's fame and used it as a reference point for his own creation of a new Shripurvat in the form of this Purana. Just as the Chaityavada branch of Mahayana Buddhism and the Vajrayana tradition believed that the worship of Shripurvat granted fulfillment of desires, similarly, Jinesena stated in his work, "Those who read this Harivansha with devotion will achieve their desired aspirations with little effort and will also benefit from Dharma, Artha, and Moksha" (66, 46). The author himself considered the mere name of Jinendra to be a remedy for the afflictions caused by planets and other celestial bodies (66, 41) and believed that the worship of Singhavahiini (Ambadevi) would bring peace from all obstacles (66, 44).

Jainism has made a significant and profound contribution to Indian culture. However, the elements adopted from other parallel streams of this culture are equally important. There is a great need to connect these scattered links through research and investigation. For this task, the first and foremost requirement is the smooth publication of literature, as a vast amount of Jain literature remains unpublished and unknown. This is evident from a mere glance at the published catalogs of Jain libraries, especially those in Jaipur. Along with the publication of this ancient literature, there is a need for accurate translations into Hindi and other prevalent languages. It is gratifying to note that this work is being carried out in a planned manner by some Granthamalas, among which the Murtidevi Granthamala holds a special place. There is an urgent need for internal and comparative research from historical and cultural perspectives, especially for the published literature, particularly the Jain Puranas.

This book has been edited by Pandit Pannalalji based on five or six manuscripts and adorned with his translation. He has mentioned and hinted at many important aspects related to the book in his preface. Some points have been raised that require further consideration and verification. For example, he mentions the reference to the Vimalkrit Harivansha Purana or Charit in the Kuvalayamala, but he completely overlooks the passage that the editor of Kuvalayamala (Dr. Upadhye) has accepted in his edition. The reading "Harivarisan" instead of "Harivans" in that passage can lead to a different interpretation. He mentions the imitation of this work in the Padmapurana by Ravishenacharya and in the Mahapurana, but the level of verification and seriousness that is desirable for these important opinions is not found here. An attempt has been made to rectify some other points through the above discussion.

Along with this book, Pandit Pannalalji has rendered a great service to Jain literature by presenting editions and translations of three ancient Jain Puranas - Mahapurana, Padmapurana, and Harivansha Purana. All three editions have been presented in a much purer and more useful form than their previous editions, making them highly beneficial for both ordinary readers and researchers in this field. This is our hope.

[1] Editing - Introduction
Preface
The editing of the Harivansh Purana was done based on the following six manuscripts:
'K' Manuscript - This manuscript was obtained from Shri Di. Jain Saraswati Bhandar Dharmpura, Delhi, courtesy of Pandit Parmanandji Shastri. Its folio number is 282, with 13-14 lines per folio and 42 to 45 characters per line. The manuscript is ancient, and due to its dilapidated condition, several folios have been separated and new ones written. The last folio has also been replaced due to its dilapidated condition, so the script's date could not be determined. The ink is red-black, the characters are legible, and there are occasional annotations. The text is mostly accurate. The folio size is 11 x 5 inches. Its code name is 'K'.

'Kh' Manuscript - This manuscript was also obtained from Panchayati Mandir Delhi, courtesy of Pandit Parmanandji Shastri. It was written in Samvat 1871. Its condition is good, but the paper is starting to deteriorate. The ink is red-black, and the folio number is 330. There are 12-13 lines per folio and 35-38 characters per line. The folio size is 123 x 6 inches. Its code name is 'Kh'.

'G' Manuscript - This manuscript was obtained courtesy of Shri Pandit Chainsukhdasji Nyayatirith and Dr. Kasturchandraji Kasliwal, Jaipur. It contains 313 folios of 1245 size. There are 12 lines per folio and 45-50 characters per line. It is ancient, but in several places, it has become dilapidated, and new folios have been written and included. There are occasional annotations, the text is accurate, and the condition is good. The writing is from Samvat 1830. Its code name is 'G'.

'Gh' Manuscript - This manuscript was available from the Bhandarkar Research Institute, Pune. It contains 376 folios of 12 x 5 inches, with 12 lines per folio and 36-40 characters per line. It is written in black-red ink, the script is legible, and the condition is good. The writing date is unknown, but the condition of the paper suggests it is quite ancient. Its code name is 'Gh'.

'Ng' Manuscript - This manuscript was obtained from Jaipur, courtesy of Pandit Chainsukhdasji Nyayatirith and Dr. Kasturchandraji Kasliwal. It contains 420 folios of 125 inches size. There are 11-12 lines per folio and 40-42 characters per line. The characters are legible, the paper is thin, and the writing date is 1640 Vikram Samvat. The condition is good, and due to ink defects, some folios have stuck together. There are some annotations in between, and the text is accurate. At the end, there is a note:
'Samvat 1640 varshe Chaitre mase Shukla pakshe Shashthyaam tithi Budhavasare Rohini namak nakshatre Shri Mulasanghe'. Its code name is 'Ng'.

'M' Manuscript - This manuscript was published in two parts by Pandit Darbarilalji Nyayatirith (current name - Satyabhakta) from Manikchandra Granthamala, Bombay. It contains only the original text. Wherever there are inaccuracies that are noticeable, they have been corrected. Its code name is 'M'.

**Harivansh Purana**

The text has been established by collating manuscripts from the Pannalal Saraswati Bhavan, Bombay, and the Oriental Research Institute, Mysore. We received significant assistance in this endeavor from Shri Pandit Kundanlalji Shastri and Pandit K. Shri Bhujabali Shastri of Moodbidri.

**[2] Harivansh Purana**

To my knowledge, three Harivansh Puranas exist. Two are in Sanskrit, and one is in Apabhramsha. The Apabhramsha Harivansh was composed by the great poet Raidhū. I saw a copy of it in the Jain temple of Kurawai (Sagar). Of the two Sanskrit Harivanshas, one was composed by Harivansh Brahmachari Jinadas. A copy of this is available at the Bhandarkar Research Institute in Pune. The composition is simple and concise. It only includes the narrative portion, excluding other descriptions that appear in Jinasena's Harivansh. The second Harivansh is by Acharya Jinasena, and its edition is in the hands of the readers.

Acharya Jinasena's Harivansh Purana holds a prominent position in the narrative literature of the Digambara sect. It is not only significant in terms of subject matter but also in terms of antiquity, ranking as the third Sanskrit narrative text. The first is Ravishena Acharya's Padma Purana, the second is Jatasimhanandi's Varangacharita, and the third is this Harivansh by Jinasena. Although Jinasena mentions Mahasena's Sulochana Katha and some other texts in his Harivansh, nothing can be said about them due to their unavailability. Jinasena, the author of Harivansh, remembers Jinasena Swami, the author of Parshvabhyudaya, at the beginning of his work. Therefore, his Mahapurana should precede Harivansh... This belief does not seem appropriate because Jinasena, while remembering Jinasena (the first) in his Harivansh Purana and mentioning his Parshvabhyudaya, does not mention the Mahapurana. This indicates that Jinasena (the first)'s Mahapurana was not composed before the composition of Harivansh. The Mahapurana is the last work of Jinasena Swami's life, which is why it remained incomplete. It was completed by his disciple Gunabhadracharya. After examining both Harivansh and Mahapurana, it seems that the author of Mahapurana composed it after seeing Harivansh. The detailed descriptions of the three realms, music, and the rules of vows, interspersed in the Harivansh Purana, detract from the beauty of the narrative. Therefore, in the Mahapurana, all these details are omitted, and a concise description is provided as needed. The language and the use of literary devices are also much more refined in the Mahapurana compared to the Harivansh Purana.

**[3] The Basis of Harivansh Purana**

Just as the basis of Jinasena's Mahapurana is the 'Vagarthasangrah Purana' by the great poet, similarly, Harivansh must have had some basis. Jinasena, the author of Harivansh, mentions a detailed and uninterrupted lineage of Acharyas from Bhagwan Mahavira to 683 years after him and up to his time in the last chapter of the original text. This makes it clear that his guru was Kirtipen, and he probably received the story of Harivansh from him.

Udyotan Suri, the author of Kuvalayamala (Vikram Samvat 835), praises Ravishena's Padmacharita and Jatasimhanandi's Varangacharita in his Kuvalayamala, just as he praises Harivansh. He writes, "I bow to Harivansh, beloved of thousands of wise men, the creator of Harivansh, the first to be worshipped, and the pure-footed."

## Introduction

Here, the term 'Vimala Pada' (which means 'pure feet' and 'pure path') has two meanings. The 'Harivaṃśa' by Vimala Sūrika is still unavailable, and its discovery could help determine the original basis of the 'Harivaṃśa'.  Considering the style of narration, it is clear that the author has carefully studied the 'Padmacarita' by Raviṣeṇa. The use of prose is not found in other 'Padmamaya' texts, but just as Raviṣeṇa used prose with a rhythmic flow in the 'Padmacarita', so too has Jinaseṇa used prose with a rhythmic flow in the 49th chapter of the 'Harivaṃśa' while praising Nemi Jinendra. The description of the 'loka-vibhāga' (division of the world) and the 'śalākā-puruṣa' (key figures) in the 'Harivaṃśa' aligns with the 'Trailokya Prajñapti'. The description of the 'dvādaśāṅga' (twelve parts of Jain scriptures) is in line with the 'Rājāvatīka', the description of music is inspired by Bharata Muni's 'Nāṭyaśāstra', and the explanation of the 'tattva' (principles) is in accordance with the 'Tattvārthasūtra' and 'Sarvārthasiddhi'. This suggests that Ācārya Jinaseṇa has thoroughly studied all these texts. The comparative notes provided in the respective sections make this conclusion easy to reach. However, I am unable to determine from which texts the descriptions of 'vratavidhāna' (rules of vows), 'samavasaraṇa' (assembly of the Tirthankaras), and 'Jinendra vihāra' (conduct of the Tirthankaras) are inspired. [4]

## The Author of the Harivaṃśa Purāṇa: Ācārya Jinaseṇa

The author of the 'Harivaṃśa Purāṇa', Ācārya Jinaseṇa, belonged to the Punṇāṭa Sangha. He is different from Jinaseṇa, the author of the 'Mahāpurāṇa' and other works. His guru's name was Kītiṣaṇa and his dadaguru's name was Jinaseṇa. The guru of Jinaseṇa, the author of the 'Mahāpurāṇa' and other works, was Vīraseṇa and his dadaguru was Āryanandī. Punṇāṭa is the ancient name of Karnataka, hence the name of the monastic order from that region was the Punṇāṭa Sangha. There is no mention of Jinaseṇa's birthplace, parents, or early life. For a renunciate, such details are not necessary.

Ācārya Jinaseṇa was a learned scholar, as is evident from the study of the 'Harivaṃśa Purāṇa'. The 'Harivaṃśa Purāṇa' is not only a purāṇa but also presents a good explanation of various topics from Jain literature, making it an unparalleled text in Jain literature. [5]

## The Guru Paramparā of the Author

The 66th chapter of the 'Harivaṃśa Purāṇa' lists the same lineage of Ācāryas from Bhagavān Mahāvīra to Lohācārya that is found in other texts like 'Śrutāvatāra'. However, after that, i.e., 683 years after Vīra Nirvāṇa, Jinaseṇa has provided an unbroken lineage from his guru Kītiṣaṇa onwards, which is not found elsewhere. This makes the importance of this text even greater. That lineage is as follows: Vinayadhara, Śrutigupta, Ṛṣigupta, Śivagupta, Mandarārya, Mitravirya, Baldeva, Balamitra, Simhabala, Vīravit, Padmaseṇa, Vyāghrahasti, Nāgahasti, Jitadanda, Nandīṣeṇa, Dīpaseṇa, Dharaseṇa, Dharmaseṇa, Simhaseṇa, Nandīṣeṇa, Iśvaraseṇa, Nandīṣeṇa, Abhayaseṇa, Siddhaseṇa, Abhayaseṇa, Bhīmaseṇa, Jinaseṇa, Śāntiṣeṇa, Jayaseṇa, Amitaseṇa; Kītiṣaṇa and Jinaseṇa (the author of the 'Harivaṃśa').

Among them, Amitaseṇa is described as the leader of the Punṇāṭa Gaṇa and a centenarian. 28 Ācāryas are mentioned in the 683 years from Vīra Nirvāṇa to Lohācārya. The existence of Lohācārya is accepted until Vikrama Samvat 213, and the existence of Jinaseṇa is established until Vikrama Samvat 840. Thus, the presence of 31 Ācāryas in this gap of 627 years is consistent.

1. In the introduction to the second part of the 'Trailokya Prajñapti' published by the Br. Jīvarāja Granthamālā, Solapur, its editors Dr. Hīrālāl Jī and Dr. A.N. Upādhye have compared the 'Trailokya Prajñapti' with other texts, including the 'Harivaṃśa', and discussed the similarities and differences in their descriptions. We do not delve into that discussion here due to space constraints, but we do draw the readers' attention to it. 2. 'Harivaṃśa Purāṇa', Chapter 66, Verses 22-33.

### [6] Location of the Composition of Harivansha
The composition of the Harivansha Purana began in Vardhamanpur and ended in the Shanti Nath Jinalaya of Dostatika. This Vardhamanpur appears to be the famous city of 'Vadhavan' in Saurashtra, as this assumption is strengthened by considering the geographical situation described in the Harivansha Purana at that time.

In the 52nd and 53rd verses of the 66th chapter of the Harivansha Purana, it is stated that in the year 705 of the Saka era, when Indraayudh ruled the north, Shrivallabh, the son of Krishna, ruled the south, Vatsaraj, the king of Avanti, ruled the east, and the valiant Jayavaraha, the protector of the Saurashtra region, ruled the west, this text was first begun in the Parsva Jinalaya of Vardhamanpur, which was known as Nannaraj Vasatika, and was filled with abundant wealth, either from good fortune or from gold. Later, it was composed in the peaceful home of Shanti Jinendra, located there, which was adorned with excellent worship produced by the people of Dostatika.

On the way from Vadhavan to Girinagar, there is a place called 'Dottaddi', which is the same as 'Dostatika'. In the ancient Gurjar-Kavya Sangraha (Gayaqwad Series), the Amul-created Charcharika has been published, which describes the journey of a traveler to Girinar. This traveler first reaches Vadhavan. Then, in sequence, he reaches Ranndulhai, Sahajigpur, Gangilpur, and Lakhmighru. Then, after reaching the difficult Dottaddi, he crosses many rivers and mountains and reaches Karivandial. He camps in Karivandial and Anantpur and rests in Bhalan. From there, he begins to see the high Girinar mountain. This difficult Dottaddi is the same as Dostatika.

Just as Jinaseenacharya described Vardhamanpur (Vadhavan) as being filled with abundant wealth due to many good fortunes, similarly, Harishena, the author of the Harishena Katha Kosh, also described it as 'Kartasvara-पूर्णजनाधिवास'. Both Kartasvara and Kalyan are indicative of gold, which proves that the city was extremely prosperous, and its prosperity remained intact for a long period of 148 years, from Jinaseen to Harishena. Harishena completed the composition of his Katha Kosh in this same Vardhamanpur (Vadhavan) in the year 853 of the Saka era (989 of the Vikram Samvat).

Although Jinaseen belonged to the Punnat Sangha, and the name Punnat refers to Karnataka, his arrival in Saurashtra is justified due to his love for travel. It is not surprising that the monks of the Punnat Sangha traveled to this region with the intention of paying homage to the holy site of Girinar mountain. Jinaseen wrote in his Guru Parampara that Amitasen was the leader of the Punnat Gan and a Shatavarpjivi. This suggests that this Sangha, under the leadership of Amitasen, left the Punnat-Karnataka region and traveled towards North India, and went to Saurashtra (Kathiawar) to pay homage to the holy land of Shri Girinar.

It is also necessary to consider the kings mentioned by Jinaseen in the four directions of Vardhamanpur:

1. In the seventh century of the Saka era, in the northwest direction, Indraayudh ruled, in the south, Shrivallabh, the son of Krishna, ruled. In the east, the glorious king Vatsaraj, the king of Avanti, ruled, and in the west, the valiant Jayavaraha, the protector of the brave, ruled.

52. In Vardhamanpur, which was filled with abundant wealth due to many good fortunes, the Parsva Jinalaya, known as Nannaraj Vasatika, was well-maintained.

53. Later, in the peaceful home of Shanti Jinendra, which was adorned with excellent worship produced by the people of Dostatika, the lineage of the Haris was composed.

## Introduction

1. **Indrayudha**
Oza has written that it is not known to which dynasty Indrayudha and Chakraayudha belonged, but it is possible that they were Rathods. According to Chintamani Vinayak Vaidya, Indrayudha belonged to the Bhandi clan, which is also known as the Varma dynasty. His son Chakraayudha was defeated by Nagabhata II, the son of Vatsaraja, the king of the Pratihara dynasty, whose reign, according to Vincent Smith, was from 857-882 CE. The kingdom of Kannauj was taken from him. The region of Marwar lies to the north of Bhadwar. This means that Indrayudha's kingdom extended from Kannauj to Marwar.

2. **Srivallabha**
He was the son of Krishna (I), the king of the Rashtrakuta dynasty of the south. His famous name was Govinda (II). In the copper plates found in Kavi, he is written as Vallabha, not Govinda. Therefore, there is no doubt that he was Govinda (II) and his kingdom was in the southern direction of Vardhamanpur. Bhadwar is almost to the south of it. A copper plate of his from 692 CE (827 CE) has also been found.

3. **Avantibhuti Vatsaraja**
He was the king of the Pratihara dynasty and the father of Nagavaloak or Nagabhata (II), who defeated Chakraayudha. Vatsaraja had conquered the kings of Gauda and Bengal and had taken two white umbrellas from them. Later, these umbrellas were taken away by Dhruvaraja, the younger brother of Rashtrakuta Govinda (II) or Srivallabha, who attacked him and forced him to flee towards the inaccessible sandy land of Marwar.

Oza has written that the said Vatsaraja attacked the king of Malwa and Dhruvaraja attacked him to save the Malwa king. In 705 CE, Malwa was under the control of Vatsaraja because the coronation of Dhruvaraja is estimated to be around 707 CE. Before that, in 705 CE, Govinda (II) (Srivallabha) was the king, and therefore, Dhruvaraja's attack must have happened after that.

Udyotana Suri had completed his Kuvalayamala in Javalippur or Jalore (Marwar) when one day was left for the end of 700 CE. At that time, Vatsaraja's kingdom was there, meaning that at the time of the creation of Harivansha (in 705 CE), Marwar (in the north) was under Indrayudha and Malwa (in the east) was under Vatsaraja! But 5 years before this (in 700 CE), Vatsaraja was the ruler of Marwar. This suggests that he must have taken control of Malwa from Marwar and then fled back to Marwar after Dhruvaraja's attack. In 705 CE, he would have been the ruler of Avanti or Malwa. Avanti is to the east of Bhadwar. But it is not known who was the king of Avanti at that time, for whose help the Rashtrakuta Dhruvaraja had rushed. Dhruvaraja ascended the throne around 707 CE. From all these things, it seems right that at the time of the creation of Harivansha, Indrayudha's kingdom was in the north, Srivallabha's in the south, and Vatsaraja's in the east.

## Harivansha Purana 4: Veer Jayavaraha

This was the king of the Sauras' realm in the west. We understand the Sauras' realm to be Saurashtra, which is south of Kathiawar. The author is referring to the land of the Sauras, the Saura-rashtra or Saurashtra, and the region to its west.

It is not clear which dynasty this king belonged to. We speculate that he might have been a Chalukya king, and the use of 'Varaha' with his name might be similar to how 'Mahavaaraha' is used with Kirtivarma (II). Before the Rashtrakutas, the Chalukyas were the sovereign kings, and they also ruled over Kathiawar. The Rashtrakutas took this sovereignty from them around 675 CE. Therefore, it is highly likely that during the time of the Harivansha's composition, a branch of the Chalukya dynasty might have ruled Saurashtra, and this king might have been referred to as Jayavaraha. Perhaps his full name was Jayasimha, and Varaha was an epithet.

A donation inscription from the village of Haddala (Kathiawar) from 836 CE, during the reign of the Pratihara king Mahipala, reveals that Dharanivaraha, a member of the Chavda dynasty and a tributary king of the Pratiharas, ruled over Barda. This suggests another possibility that the aforementioned Jayavaraha might have been an ancestor of Dharanivaraha, 4-6 generations earlier. [7] The Time of Composition of Harivansha

In the 52nd verse of the final chapter, Jinaseenacharya has mentioned the time of composition of Harivansha as 705 CE, which corresponds to 840 CE. Jinaseen has mentioned the time of composition of his work only in the Saka Samvat, while Harishena, while mentioning the time of composition of Kathakoosha, has mentioned both Saka Samvat and Vikrama Samvat. In North India, Gujarat, Malwa, etc., Vikrama Samvat was prevalent, while Saka Samvat was prevalent in the south. Jinaseen had only passed a couple of generations since his arrival from the south, so he mentioned only Saka Samvat in his work. However, Harishena had spent many generations in Kathiawar, so he considered it appropriate to mention Vikrama Samvat along with it, according to the local practice.

[8] Scholars Preceding Jinaseen

Out of gratitude, Jinaseen has praised his predecessors, Samantabhadra, Siddhasena, Devanandi, Vajrasuri, Mahaseen, Ravishena, Jatasimhanando, Shanta (Shantapeen) Visheshvadi, Kumarasena Garu, Veerasenagaru, Jinaseen Swami, and the author of Vardhaman Purana, by mentioning their names. Therefore, here is some brief information about them:

Samantabhadra

Samantabhadra was a Kshatriya prince. His birth name was Shantivarma, but later he became known in the world as 'Samantabhadra'. It is not known what his guru's name was or what his guru parampara was. He is credited with being a debater, orator, poet, and panegyrist. He was a profound scholar of philosophy and possessed exceptional brilliance. In an introductory verse, he is described as an astrologer, physician, magician, tantric, and also an Agyasiddha Siddhasarvasvat. His lion's roar made all the debaters tremble. He traveled to many countries and defeated debaters, showing them the right path. His available works are very important, concise, profound, and evocative of deep meaning. Their names are as follows:

1. Harivansha Purana. Chapter 1. Verse 26-41.

## Introduction

15

There are five main texts: 1. Brihatsvayambhustotra, 2. Yuktyanusasan, 3. Aptmimamsa, 4. Ratnakaranḍa Shravakachar, and 5. Stutividya. Harivamshapuranakar Jinsen has mentioned these two texts, Jivasiddhi and Yuktyanusasan. Their time is considered to be the 2nd-3rd century Vikram era. Siddhasen

There have been many scholars with this name, but this Siddhasen is known as the author of the Prakrit text called Sanmatiprakaran. He was a distinguished scholar of Nyaya Shastra. His time should be the 6th-7th century Vikram era. Some ancient Dvadashika authors were also Digambar Siddhasen. This Siddhasen is different from the Shvetambari scholar Siddhasen Divakar, the author of Nyayavtar. Devanandi

This is the second name of Pujyapada. According to the inscription number 40 (64) of Shravanabelagola, his three names are Devanandi, Jinendrabuddhi, and Pujyapada. This Acharya was a very learned scholar of his time. His brilliance was multifaceted. This mention in Darsansar suggests that in 526 Vikram Samvat, Pujyapada's disciple Vajranandi established the Dravid Sangha in Dakshin Mathura or Madurai. You are a scholar who predates 526 Vikram Samvat. Acharya Jinsen has remembered him as a grammarian. So far, five of his texts have been found: Jainendra Vyakaran, Sarvarth Siddhi, Samadhi Tantra, Ishtopadeś, and Dashabhakti. Vajrasuri

He seems to be the disciple of Devanandi or Pujyapada, the founder of the Dravid Sangha, Vajranandi. Jinsen has described his views as evidence like the speakers or Ganadhar Devas and has pointed to a text of his that discusses bondage and liberation and their causes. According to the mention in Darsansar, you are a scholar from the beginning of the 6th century. Mahasen

Jinsen has called him the author of Sulochana Katha. His specific identity is unknown. Ravishen

You are Ravishen, the author of Padma Purana. By creating the pleasant and heart-touching composition of Padma Purana, you have presented the Ramayana in your own way to the learned society. You were a scholar of the middle of the 8th century Vikram era. You completed the composition of Padma Purana in 733 Vikram Samvat. Jatasimhanandi

Jinsen has not mentioned his name but has mentioned his Varangacharit. He was a very great ascetic. He died in Samadhi in 'Koppan'. Near Koppan, on a mountain called 'Pallavaki Gundhu', his footprints are also inscribed, and below them is an inscription in old Kannada of two lines, which was prepared by a person named 'Chapayya'. His only work, 'Varangacharit', has been edited by Dr. A.N. Upadhye and published by Manikchand Granthamala, Bombay. King Varang was during the time of the 22nd Tirthankar, Neminath. Upadhyeji has fixed the time of Jatasimhanandi as the 7th century.

1. See, Anekanta: Year 6, Kiran 11-12, published by Pandit Jugalkishorji Mukhtar's article titled 'Sanmatisutra and Siddhasen'.

## Harivamsha Purana

**Shanti**

His full name is known to be Shantishena. His use of figurative language, particularly his skillful use of *vakrokti* (figurative speech), has been praised. He is believed to have written a poetic work. Jinsen, while describing his guru lineage, mentions an Acharya named Shantishena who preceded Jayasena. It is highly likely that this Shanti is the same as Shantishena. 

**Visheshvadi**

Jinsen refers to a work by him that is a mixture of prose and poetry, and whose sayings are highly distinctive. Vadiraj also mentions him in his *Parshvanathcharit*.

**Kumarasen Guru**

He was the guru of Prabhachandra, the author of the *Chandrodya* text. His pure fame traversed the ocean of knowledge. His time period is uncertain. He is also mentioned in verse 15 of the *Chamundaray Purana*. Dr. Upadhye, while introducing him in the *Jain Sandesh* research journal, volume 12, writes that he accepted self-sacrifice at a place called *Mulagunda*, became absorbed in meditation on the *Koppanadri* mountain, and died in a state of samadhi.

**Virasen Guru**

He was the Acharya of the *Malsangh Panchastupayanvaya*, which became known in the world as the *Sensangh*. He was the disciple of Chandrasena, the student of Aryananda, and the guru of Jinsen, the author of the *Mahapuraan* and other works. He passed away after writing the *Dhavla* commentary on the *Shatkhandagam*, which is 72,000 verses long, and the *Jayadhavla* commentary on *Kashayaprabhrut*, which is 20,000 verses long. Jinsen calls him the emperor of poets and a conqueror of the afterlife. His time period is the first half of the 9th century CE.

**Jinsen Swami**

He was the disciple of Virasen Guru. Jinsen, the author of the *Harivamsha Purana*, mentions his *Parshvabhyudaya* text. He is also the author of the remaining 40,000 verses of the commentary on the *Mahapuraan* and *Kashayaprabhrut*. This suggests that he wrote the *Parshvabhyudaya* during the time of the *Harivamsha Purana*. The *Jayadhavla* and *Mahapuraan* were written later, and the *Mahapuraan* can be considered his final work, which he was unable to complete. His capable disciple, Gunabhadra, completed it. His time period is the 9th century CE.

**Author of the *Vardhaman Purana***

Jinsen mentions the *Vardhaman Purana*, but does not name its author. It is likely that it was a very famous text during his time.

**Story of the *Harivamsha Purana***

The *Harivamsha Purana* primarily focuses on the life story of the 22nd Tirthankara, Shri Neminath Bhagwan. However, it also includes other narratives that arise naturally within the story. This is evident from the concluding phrase of each chapter of the *Harivamsha*, where Jinsen mentions "iti Arishta Nemipuraan Sangrah" (thus ends the collection of the Neminath Purana). The life of Bhagwan Neminath is an ideal of renunciation. He was the radiant sun in the sky of the *Harivamsha*. Along with Bhagwan Neminath, the captivating stories of Shri Krishna and Rama, who held the positions of Narayana and Balabhadra, are also included. The popular story of the Pandavas and Kauravas is beautifully depicted. The story of Shri Krishna's son, Pradyumna, also has its own separate place in the text.

## Introduction
[10] The Literary Excellence of the Harivansh Purana
The Harivansh Purana is not only a narrative text but also a high-quality epic with the qualities of a Maha Kavya. Its literary excellence increases from the 37th chapter, which begins the story of Lord Nemnath. The 55th chapter is adorned with various literary devices like Yamaka and other Alankaras. Many chapters are embellished with beautiful Chhandas. The descriptions of seasons, moonrise, etc., are unique in their style. The Chhandas chosen by Jinsen to describe Lord Nemnath's renunciation and Baldev's lament are perfectly suited to the Rasa. The depiction of Baldev's sorrowful lament and affection after Lord Krishna's death is similar to the description of Rama's lament in the Patra Purana by Ravishen after Lakshman's death. The portrayal is so poignant that the reader cannot hold back tears. Reading the description of Nemnath's renunciation makes every human heart turn away from the illusions and attachments of the world. While the reader sheds tears of empathy for Rajimati's abandonment, their ideal devotion inspires deep faith in them.
The final words uttered by Krishna at the time of his death elevate his glory to great heights. The equality that should exist in the consequences of being bound by the nature of a Tirthankara remains constant until the end. I wanted to highlight the excellence of the text by quoting some passages, but I am refraining from doing so due to the fear of making the writing too long. I request the reader to engage in self-study of the text and experience the Rasa. [11] The Harivansh Purana and Description of the World
The Harivansh Purana is famous for its description of the world, which is inspired by the Trailokya Prajnapti. It is noteworthy that this topic is discussed in such detail in any Purana. While other narrative texts like Puranas only briefly describe the world, this text elaborates on it with great detail and clarity. Many passages also make good mention of the Karan Sutras. If the section on the division of the world were to be published separately with a Hindi translation, readers could access it at a low cost. [12] The Harivansh Purana and Dharma Shastra
The author has elaborated on the principles of the divine sound of Lord Nemnath in great detail. The basis of this elaboration is the Tattvarth Sutra of Umaswami Maharaj and the Sarvarth Siddhi commentary of Pujyapada Swami. The description makes it seem as if the Tattvarth Sutra and Sarvarth Siddhi have been transformed into verses and presented before us. The reader's mind remains cheerful as they read the elaboration of principles interspersed with the narrative. [13] A Point for Consideration
In the Digambar tradition, Narada is considered to be a resident of hell, but the author of the Harivansh Purana has described him as a Charma Shariri (one who has attained the final body).
"In this proposal, the most respected Ganijyeshta asked the Shreni, 'Who is this Narada, and from where did he originate?'" (Chapter 42, Verse 12)
"The Ganijyeshta said, 'Listen, Shreni, I will tell you. The origin of Narada's final body and his state are as follows.'" (Chapter 42, Verse 13)
"The final body is naturally free from impurities, but this one is a Kshatriya. He is fond of watching battles and is known as a gossip-monger." (Chapter 42, Verse 22) [3]

Page #20:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, Narada, the best of men, renounced the world and through the power of his austerities, achieved the destruction of his karma, liberation, and the imperishable state. (Verse 24, Chapter 65)

In verses 13 and 12 of this chapter, Narada's final body is mentioned, with many manuscripts also containing the annotation "चरमशरीरस्य" (charamasharīrasya). Verse 65 clearly states that he attained imperishable liberation.

This account of Narada's liberation is worth considering. Similarly, at the end of Chapter 65, there is a story about Balarama becoming a deity in Brahmaloka. Using his knowledge of the past, present, and future, he learns about Krishna's soul and goes to the Balukaprabha earth to address him. Balarama's soul, in the form of a deity, introduces himself to Krishna and tries to take him to Brahmaloka, but all his efforts fail. Finally, Krishna's soul tells Balarama, "Brother, go and enjoy the fruits of your heaven. When my lifespan ends, I will also attain the human state, which will be the cause of my liberation. At that time, we will both perform austerities and through the destruction of karma, attain liberation by serving the Jina's teachings. But you must ensure that in Bharatavarsha, we both appear with our sons and great splendor. People will be amazed and astonished to see us. And in every home, let my image be made with a conch, discus, and mace in my hands. To increase my fame, let Bharatavarsha be filled with our temples."

Balarama's soul accepted Krishna's words and said, "Have faith in the right view." He then came to Bharatavarsha and, according to Krishna's instructions, manifested their influence. He built their images and temples, filling Bharatavarsha with them.

The point to consider in this account is that anyone bound by the nature of a Tirthankara will certainly have the right view. It is true that when they were born in Balukaprabha, they may have lost their right view, but it is certain that they regained it after their incomplete state. The soul with the right view inspired the creation of false images to increase their reputation in the world, and the soul of Balarama, with the right view, acted accordingly. The consistency of this account is not entirely clear.

**Editing and Acknowledgements**

Editing this text was a laborious task. It was easier to edit sections for which we had a basis, but for those without any basis, extensive research was required. We were fortunate to find some palm leaf manuscripts for the Mahapurana, which greatly helped in determining the correct text. However, we were unable to find any palm leaf manuscripts of the Harivamsha Purana. We only found paper manuscripts available in the repositories of North India. We do not hesitate to say that the paper manuscripts written in North India are sometimes written by professional scribes who were often unfamiliar with the Sanskrit language. Due to the efforts of such scribes, the manuscripts are often inaccurate, and it requires much thought to determine the correct text. There were many passages in this text where I had to compare the text with other manuscripts. I even had to write an article on the topic of "What is Padmayan?" for the Jain Sandesh. Pandit K. Bhujabali Shastri helped me compare the text with manuscripts from Mysore, and Pandit Kundalalji helped me compare the text with manuscripts from Bombay. Pandit Ratnalalji Katariya of Kekri is also a worthy scholar. After reading my article on "Padmayan," he suggested that the reading "शम्भुरारोढं" (Shambhurarohdam) should be used instead of "सिन्धुरारोढुं" (Sindhurarohdum). All the available manuscripts had the reading "सिन्धुरारोढुं," but after searching, I found the reading "शम्भुरारोढुं" in the Mysore manuscripts, which made the meaning consistent. There are one or two other passages where he provided valuable insights.

## Introduction
19

I am grateful to the scholars who have helped me in this work. I am particularly indebted to Shri Naradamukti and Samyagdristi for drawing my attention to the issue of Krishna's misleading path. I am also grateful to Pandit Darbarilalji Satyabhakta for editing the original Harivansh Purana, published by Manikchand Granthamala, Bombay, and to Pandit Daulatramji and Pandit Gajadharlalji for their Hindi commentary, which has been of great help in our work. I express my respect for them. I have taken full advantage of Shriman Swargiey Nathuramji Premi's "History of Jain Literature" in writing this introduction and express my gratitude to him. Premiji had personally reviewed the introduction to the Mahapurana even while he was ill. He had also provided considerable input through letters for the introduction to the Padma Purana, but unfortunately, we did not receive his direct assistance during the writing of the introduction to the Harivansh Purana. We only have his indirect assistance through his writings, which saddens me. His noble spirit of testing and elevating individuals attracted everyone who came into contact with him. An attempt has been made to make this edition of Harivansh extremely useful by including a verse index, glossary, and other pillars like Suktiratnakar. The comparative notes in the respective chapters also make it useful. I am grateful to Dr. Hiralalji, Dr. A.N. Upadhye, and Babu Lakshmichandraji for their suggestions and encouragement in this work. The founder of Bharatiya Gyanpeeth, Sahu Shantiprasadji, and its chairperson, Ramarani ji, deserve thanks for publishing this beautiful and well-organized work. My long-standing endeavor to edit the Mahapurana, Padma Purana, and Harivansh Purana has been fulfilled thanks to Sahuji's generosity. How can I express my gratitude to him in words?

It would not be irrelevant to mention here that today's environment is very conducive to the propagation of the Arhat Darshan. From the time of Shankaracharya until about twenty-five to fifty years ago, the times were so turbulent that people considered it a sin to even listen to the teachings or religion of others. Fortunately, that turbulent environment is almost over and is slowly approaching its end. Today, humans are ready to listen and understand the teachings and religions of others. Today, the diamonds and jewels of Arhat Darshan, the unique and unparalleled works of Kundkund and Samantabhadra, should be placed before the world so that the soul of every human being in the world can be illuminated by their divine light. There is a need to let the spiritual current of Kundkund Swami flow on the world stage so that today's suffering and distressed humanity can immerse themselves in it and experience true peace. The five principles on which today's government wants to establish world peace are deeply embedded in the Arhat Darshan, its Puranas, poetry, and story books. If the society following the Arhat Darshan makes a five-year plan for the propagation of its teachings and works with full force, it will create a significant change in its history. Millions and billions of wealth are lying unused inside Jain temples. If it is used for the propagation of the teachings of Jinendra Dev, it will be a great act of merit. Spending money on the propagation of Jinvani is a thousand times better than collecting silver and gold utensils and installing marble in temples - it is truly impactful for the Arhat Dharma.

Finally, I conclude this introduction by apologizing for any errors that may have occurred due to the vastness of the text, my limited knowledge, and my busy schedule.

The daughters of the king of Shravasti, Aniputra, Priyangu Sundari, having heard the news of the tapaswis in the ashram, entered the city after engaging in frivolous talk with them.

**Chapter 29**

Description of Vasudev Kumar's acquisition of Bandhumati and Priyangu Sundari daughters.

**Chapter 30**

On the night of Kartik Purnima, Kumar Vasudev was fast asleep when a very beautiful girl woke him up and took him to a secluded place, introducing herself. She said, "I am Prabhavati, and I have brought news of your beloved Vegavati. Somashri has sent me." Kumar went with her to Somashri's house and was delighted to meet his long-separated beloveds. In this episode, he acquired Prabhavati.

**Chapter 31**

After marrying many daughters, Kumar Vasudev came to the city of Arishtpur and, disguised, arrived at the Swayamvara of Rohini, the daughter of King Rudhir. He sat among the group of musicians called 'Panav'. Rohini placed the garland around Vasudev's neck. This incident angered many kings, who were eager to fight Vasudev. Jarasandha made the kings fight Vasudev one by one. Finally, the turn came for Samudravijaya. The two brothers fought. After displaying his skills, Vasudev shot an arrow with a letter attached to it towards Samudravijaya, who was delighted to receive it. The reunion of the long-separated brothers brought joy everywhere.

**Chapter 32**

Vasudev had a son named 'Ram' with his wife Rohini. Hearing the plea of a Vidyadhari, Kumar Vasudev, with the permission of Samudravijaya, went back to Vijayardh Parvat and returned with all his wives.

**Chapter 33**

Vasudev stayed in Suryapur, teaching the art of weaponry. One day, he went to Rajgriha with his disciples, including Kans. Hearing Jarasandha's proclamation, he captured the lord of Singhpur, Simharath, alive. As per the proclamation, Jarasandha was to give his daughter, Jivadyasha, to Vasudev, but he did not take her himself and instead gave her to Kans. In this episode, Kans was introduced. Kans brought Vasudev to Mathura and married his sister Devaki to him. Hearing the prophecy of Ati Muktak Muni, "The son of Devaki will kill your husband," Kans's wife Jivadyasha was very scared. Kans, too, was frightened and made Vasudev promise that Devaki's delivery would happen in his house. Vasudev asked Ati Muktak Muni the reason for this. In response, the Muni described Kans's past life.

**Chapter 34**

Hearing from Ati Muktak Muni that "the 22nd Tirthankara will be born in our lineage," Vasudev was very happy. Hearing his prayer, Ati Muktak Muni described the birth of Neminath.

##  Harivaṃśapurāṇa, First Chapter, Composed by Śrī Jinaseṇācārya

**1.**  This is the Jain scripture, the Harivaṃśapurāṇa, composed by Śrī Jinaseṇācārya. It is a scripture that is **siddh** (proven true) and deals with the characteristics of **dhrauvya** (permanent), **vyaya** (impermanent), and **utpāda** (produced) substances. It is a scripture that is **saadhana** (conducive to liberation) and **śāsan** (teaching) based on the **dravya** (substance) and **naya** (perspective) of Jainism.

**2.**  Salutations to Śrī Vardhamāna Jinendra, the **Vardhamāna** (ever-increasing) one, whose **śuddha jñāna** (pure knowledge) shines like a light, illuminating both the **loka** (world) and **aloka** (non-world).

**3.**  Salutations to **Svayambhu** (self-existent) **Vṛṣabha** (bull), the **sarvavida** (omniscient) one, who established the **vyavasthāna** (order) of the universe at the beginning of the **yuga** (era) and initiated the **dharma tīrtha** (path of righteousness).

**4.**  Salutations to **Ajita** (unconquerable) **Jinendra**, who established the second **tīrtha** (ford) and conquered all **śatru** (enemies) both internal and external.

**5.**  Salutations to the third **śambhava** (auspicious) **tīrtha** (ford), who brought **śam** (peace) and **vimukti** (liberation) to his **bhakt** (devotees) in both **bhava** (existence) and **vimukti** (liberation).

**1.**  Victory to **Sunemi** (the one with a beautiful face), the **bhavy** (worthy) one, who is like the **chandra** (moon) in the **jaladhi** (ocean) of the **Yadu** (dynasty), the **kamala** (lotus) in the **dinakara** (sun), and the **rathachakra** (chariot wheel) of **Vṛṣabha** (bull). Victory to **Jinendra** (victorious lord) **Sunemi**!

**2.**  I bow down to the **deva** (divine), **śāstra** (scripture), and **guru** (teacher) again and again, placing my head at their feet. I will write and compose the **śrī Harivaṃśapurāṇa** (the glorious story of the Harivaṃśa).

In the Harivamsha Purana, 
The verses of Siddhasena, like the pure words of Rishabha, enlighten the minds of the virtuous. ||15|| 
How can the words of Devnandī, the revered one, who observes Indra, Chandra, Arka, and Jainendra grammar, not be revered? ||30||

Who has not described the story of Mahasena, adorned with sweetness and the ornament of character, like a beautiful woman with lovely eyes? ||33|| 
The poetic form of Ravishena Ācharya, like the form of the sun, is very dear to the world, for just as the form of the sun brings about the blossoming and radiance of lotuses, so too does the poetic form of Ravishena Ācharya bring about the rise of Śrī Rāma, by composing the Padma Purana. And just as the form of the sun changes every day, so too does the poetic form of Ravishena Ācharya change and become familiar every day. ||34|| 
Just as a beautiful woman, with her hands, face, feet, and other limbs, inspires deep affection in people, so too do the meaningful words of the Varanga Charita, with all its verses, ornaments, and styles, inspire deep affection in everyone. ||35|| 
The witty compositions of Śānta (Śāntiṣena), with their beautiful similes, delight the mind and make it attached to the beautiful meaning. ||36|| 
Those who are special in all the special types of speech, in both prose and verse, and who expound the three specialities (special texts), are the special speakers. ||37||

The fame of the great Kumarasen, shining like the rising moon, spreads throughout the world. It is unconquered, unyielding. (38)

The pure fame of the great Veerasen, the conqueror of both the material and spiritual worlds, shines brightly, like a jewel without blemish. He is the emperor of poets. (39)

The verses, like rays of the rising sun, emanating from the Vardhamana Purana, illuminate the hearts of the wise, like crystal walls of mountains. (41)

It is fitting that a virtuous person should remove the flaws of a composition without being asked, just as fire purifies gold from its impurities. (43)

Just as the waves of the ocean quickly cast out any impurities that may have entered it, so too, assemblies of virtuous people quickly cast out any flaws that may have crept into a composition. (44)

Just as water, when absorbed by pure oysters, becomes a pearl, so too, a composition, when absorbed by assemblies of virtuous people, becomes radiant, like a pearl. (45)

The great kings, with their own power, subdue those wicked serpents whose tongues are filled with the poison of harsh words. (46)

In the Harivansha Purana, the wicked time, full of suffering, is destroyed. Just as wealth calms down the noise of time, so do the saints calm down the wicked. ||47|| Wise men restrain the darkness like the rays of the sun, just as the foolish, who are inclined to act alike towards the good and the bad, are restrained. ||48|| Thus, with the help of the virtuous, I make my body, which is a poem, stable in the world, free from fear and pride. ||49|| I narrate the Harivansha Purana, which is rooted in the past, famous in the world, adorned with many branches, full of vast merit, pure, like a Kalpavriksha, excellent, illuminated by the life story of Lord Arishtanemi, and captivating. ||50-51|| Just as even the smallest things like gems, lamps, fireflies, and lightning, illuminate the objects illuminated by the sun, according to their own capacity, so too, I, a person of limited capacity, am engaged in illuminating this Purana, which is illuminated by great sages. ||52-53|| Just as a man's eye, illuminated by the light of the sun, can see even distant objects, so too, my delicate mind, illuminated by the light of the ancient sages, is able to see even distant, past events. ||54|| The Agam, a well-known proof, is a proof that has five divisions based on the subject matter, substance, time, existence, and feeling, and has been explained by authoritative persons. ||55|| The founder of this Tantra is Lord Vardhaman Tirthankara himself, followed by Lord Gautam Ganadhar, the founder of the Uttar Tantra, and after them, many Acharyas, the founders of the subsequent Tantras, have appeared in succession. All of them are proof for us because they are translators of the words of the omniscient. ||56-57|| There are three Kevalins, five who hold the fourteen previous principles, ten who hold the ten previous principles, eleven who hold the eleven limbs, and one who holds one limb. These are the five types of Munis.

Page #45:
---------------------------
The First Chapter:  

The Shruta was held by Indrabhuti (Gautama) the Ganadhara from the mouth of Vardhamana Jinendra. From him, Sudharma Acharya received it, and from him, the last Kevali, Jambū, received it. ||60|| 

After him, in succession, came Vishnu, Nandimitra, Aparajita, Govardhana, and Bhadrabahu, these five Shruta Kevalis. ||61||

After them, the following eleven Munis, who knew the eleven Angas and the ten Purvas, came: Visakha, Prosthila, Kshatriya, Jaya, Naga, Siddhartha, Dhritiṣeṇa, Vijaya, Buddhila, Gangadeva, and Dharmaseṇa. ||62-63||

After them, the following five Munis, who knew the eleven Angas, came: Nakshatra, Yasahpala, Pandu, Dhruvaseṇa, and Kansacharya. ||64||

After them, the following four Munis, who held the Acharaangas, came: Subhadra, Yashobhadra, Yashobahu, and Lohaya. ||65||

Thus, this portion of the Agamas, which was spread by these and other Acharyas, is being described here. ||66||

This text is earlier in terms of meaning, that is, what is described in this text is already known from the previous Acharyas, but for those who are afraid of the vastness of the scriptures, a summary of the essential points is presented here, so this composition is new in terms of its creation. ||67||

For those noble souls who are pure in mind, speech, and body, and who constantly practice this, this Purana will be beneficial for both speaking and listening. ||68||

There are two types of tapas, external and internal, and among them, self-study is considered the supreme tapas because it is the opposite of ignorance. ||69||

Since the meaning of this Purana is conducive to the highest human goals, it should be spoken and listened to by those who know the time and place, without envy. ||70||

In this Purana, first, the structure of the universe is described, then the origin of the royal dynasties, then the incarnation of the Hari dynasty, then the actions of Vasudeva, then the story of Neminatha, the construction of Dwaraka, the description of the war, and the Nirvana - these eight auspicious chapters are described. ||71-72||

These are all adorned with their own collected chapters, and the chapters are described according to the Sutras of the Iṣu Sutras. ||73||

In the fifth Kalpa, there were three Kevalis, five who knew the fourteen Purvas, five who held the eleven Angas, eleven who knew the ten Purvas, and four who knew the Acharaangas, thus there were five types of Munis. ||58-59||

Gautama Swami states that this is the summary of the Harivamsha Purana, and he encourages the learned audience to listen to the detailed account for their own spiritual progress.

The author asks, "If the story of a single great man can destroy sin, what is the greatness of this text that describes the lives of all the Tirthankaras, Chakravartis, and Balabhadra?" He compares it to the rain from a single cloud, which can quench great thirst, and asks, "What is the greatness of the rain from thousands of clouds that cover the entire world?"

The author encourages the reader to abandon the path of worldly Puranas, which are full of confusion, and embrace the path of this Purana, which is straight and beneficial. He asks, "Who, with pure vision, will fall into the abyss of ignorance, when the path is illuminated by the sun of the Jinas?"

This concludes the first chapter of the Harivamsha Purana, titled "Sangraha Vibhaga Varnana," by Acharya Jinasena.

## The Second Canto

Now, in the Jambudvipa, there is a vast country called Videha, renowned for its prosperity, equal to the celestial realms. [1]

This land is abundant with grain and cattle, free from all calamities, and beautiful with the well-being of its people. [2]

It is adorned with mines of kheta, kharvat, matamba, puta-bhedana, drona-mukha, gold, silver, fields, villages, and herds. [3]

What is there to describe in a land where the Kshatriya leaders, the Ikshvaku kings, descend from heaven and are born in this blissful region? [4]

In this Videha country, there is a beautiful city called Kundapura, adorned with rows of lotus-like women, the eyes of Indra, and a reservoir of happiness. [5]

The sky is adorned with a multitude of white palaces, shining like the clouds of autumn, resembling conch shells. [6]

At night, the Chandrakanta stones, placed in front of the houses, melt like sweating women, touched by the rays of the moon, their husband. [7]

The Surya-kanta stones, placed on the houses, shine like women longing for their husbands, touched by the rays of the sun. [8]

The rows of Padmaraga gems, placed on the tops of the palaces, become intensely attached to the sun's rays, like a woman to her husband. [9]

This city is always adorned with the splendor of all the gems, with strings of pearls hanging here and there, and the brilliance of emerald gems. [10]

---------------------------
## The Second Chapter: Of the City Surrounded by the Great Mountain, the Forest, and the Ditch

**10.** The light is spreading, somewhere the brilliance of diamonds is spreading, and somewhere the blue-blue glow of lapis lazuli gems is scattering. Even being one with all of them, it always retains the beauty of the mine of all gems.

**11.** The city, shaped like a cave, with large mounds of dust, and surrounded by families, could only be reached by the circle of friends, i.e., the sun, not by the circle of enemies, i.e., the enemies.

**12.** The description of the qualities of this city is sufficient in itself, that the city was the foundation of Lord Mahavira when he descended from heaven - Lord Mahavira descended from heaven there.

**13.** Born to King Sarvarth and Queen Shrimati, the king there was Siddharth, the seer of all things, radiant like the sun, and the achiever of all goals and purposes.

**14.** When Siddharth protected it, the earth was only afflicted with this one fault, that its people, though desiring Dharma, had abandoned the fear of the afterlife. Meaning - those who desire Dharma, they must have the fear of the afterlife, heaven, hell, etc., but the people there had abandoned the fear of the afterlife. This is a contradiction, but the meaning of the afterlife is that the contradiction with the enemies is removed, i.e., the people there desired Dharma and were free from the fear of enemies.

**15.** Who can describe the excellent qualities of that king Siddharth, who attained the position of father of Lord Vardhaman Swami himself?

**16.** The queen Priyakarini, who was like a river of natural affection born from the mountain of a high lineage, was the beloved wife of King Siddharth, who was like the ocean of Lakshmi.

**17.** Among those seven daughters who had filled the heart of King Chetak with excessive affection, Priyakarini was the eldest daughter.

**18.** Who is capable of describing the qualities of Trisala (Priyakarini), who was destined to give birth to Lord Mahavira by her own merit?

**19.** Then, when all the rows of gods were bowing from all sides, when the rain of gems was falling from the sky due to the effect, and when Lord Mahavira was about to descend from the highest Pushpottar Vimana of the Achyuta heaven to protect the beings from his Tirtha.

**20.**  
1. The circle of the sun goes, but not the circle of enemies.
2. He whose father was named Sarvarth and mother Shrimati.
3. The afterlife is the world that is attained after death, in the case of enemies, it is the world of enemies.
4. -Nudyan M.
5. Trisala is the second name of Priyakarini.
6. Daughters.
7. In the rain of gems.
8. Beings.

Harivansh Purana
She conceived the Lord of the womb, the glorious, beloved one, after experiencing auspicious dreams. ||21||
There were seventy-five years, eight and a half months remaining in the fourth period, the period of decline and prosperity. ||22||
On the sixth day of the bright fortnight of Ashadha, the worthy one was conceived, when the moon was in the Uttara Phalguni constellation. ||23||
Just as the sun hidden within the clouds adorns the rainy season, so too did the hidden womb adorn the mother, Priyakarini, who was adorned by the Dikkumari, radiant in form, with full breasts. ||24||
After nine months and eight days, when the moon was in the Uttara Phalguni constellation, the Lord was born. ||25||
Then, due to the greatness of the last Tirthankara, the thrones and crowns shook, and the lords of the gods, knowing the events, bowed down. ||26||
Hearing the sound of conch shells in the abodes of the gods, drums in the abodes of the Vyantaras, lions in the abodes of the Jyotishis, and bells in the abodes of the Kalpavasis, the gods, who were like the churning ocean, who were accompanied by seven types of armies, who were with their wives, and who were adorned with various ornaments, arrived in the city of Kundapura. ||27-28||
The gods, led by Indra, circumambulated the city three times and bowed down to the Tirthankara, who had a face like the moon, and to his parents. ||29||
Indrani, bowing down in humility, placed a different child, created by divine magic, near the sleeping mother, and taking the Tirthankara, handed him over to Indra. ||30||
Indra, taking him in his lotus hands, worshipped him for a long time and placed him in a garden of lotus flowers, created by magic, with a thousand eyes. ||31||
Then, Indra placed the Lord on the very tall elephant, Airavata, whose body was as bright as the moon, who seemed like the peaks of Mount Meru, and who was shedding streams of nectar from his trunk. ||32||
Whose cheeks were adorned with swarms of bees due to the fragrance of nectar, and who seemed like the peaks of Mount Meru, 
1. The Lord of the womb's auspiciousness. 
2. Read as "G". 
3. Adorned by the Dikkumari. 
4. Parents.

## Second Chapter

The (mountain) with its summit adorned with a Tamala forest, like the summit of Mount Meru. ||33|| With clusters of red chamaras hanging near its ears, like the summit of Mount Meru adorned with a forest of red Asoka trees. ||34|| With its body encircled by a beautiful golden chain, like the summit of Mount Meru adorned with a golden girdle. ||35|| Filled with the sounds of music and dance performed by many celestial beings, like the summit of Mount Meru where celestial nymphs dance and sing. ||36|| With its long, round, and mobile trunks encompassing the space between the directions, like the summit of Mount Meru where large, serpentine snakes with hoods coil around. ||37|| With a large, white umbrella held aloft by Indra, like the summit of Mount Meru where the full moon shines brightly. ||38|| Adorned with fluttering chamaras held by the arms of Indra, like the summit of Mount Meru adorned with the tails of chamara deer. ||39|| Indra, having placed the Jina on the back of Airavata, adorned him and went to Mount Meru with the other gods. ||40||

There, in the beautiful Panduka forest of Mount Meru, Indra placed the Jina on the famous Panduka rock, on a lion throne. He then bathed him with the water of the ocean of milk, brought by the gods in golden pitchers. He adorned him with clothes, ornaments, and garlands, and praised him. Then, he brought him back and placed him in his mother's lap, performing all the necessary rituals. He praised the Jina, who brought equal joy to his parents, King Siddhartha and Queen Priyakarini, with the name Vardhamana. Then, he departed with the other gods. ||41-44||

For fifteen months before the Lord's birth, there was a daily shower of jewels, which satisfied all the beggars. ||45||

1. With a small golden bell garland. ||
2. It shines. ||
3. Covered with many Rakshasas. ||
4. Nourished. ||

Harivamsha Purana
Vardhamana, served by the gods, grew as he did, so did the love of his father, relatives, and the three worlds. || 46 || The hero, adorned with the garlands of crowns of gods, demons, and kings, was thirty years old. || 47 || His pure character, his mind did not dwell in pleasures for long, like a pearl in the crooked holes of a lion's claws. || 48 || With a peaceful mind, the self-enlightened one was awakened by the chief Lokantik gods, bowing to Saraswati-Aditya. || 49 || Having been awakened and renounced, he was anointed and worshipped by the gods, led by Saudharma. || 50 || Riding on a divine palanquin carried by the gods, he went to the forest on the tenth day of the dark fortnight of Margashirsha, when the moon was in Uttara Phalguni. || 51 || Removing all his clothes, garlands, and ornaments, the muni plucked out his hair with his five fingers. || 52 || Indra, taking the mass of the Jina's hair, black as a swarm of bees, placed it in a vessel of milk and water. || 53 || The ocean of milk, stained by the Jina's hair, thrown in by Indra, shone as if it were stained by a mass of Indranila gems. || 54 || Seeing the Jina's renunciation, all the gods and men were pleased, and performed the third auspicious ceremony as it should be. || 55 || Possessing the four great eyes of knowledge, namely, mati, shruti, avadhi, and manahparyaya, he performed twelve types of austerities for twelve years. || 56 || Then, the lord, adorned with the group of qualities, wandered, reaching the village of Jrimbhik, near the bank of the river Rijukula. || 57 || There, on the tenth day of the bright fortnight of Vaisakha, he took refuge in the shade of a sala tree, near a rock. || 58 ||

## Second Chapter

When the moon was in the Uttara Phalguni constellation, the one who meditates on the pure, Vardhaman Jineendra, having destroyed the group of karmas, attained Kevala Jnana. ||5||

Due to the influence of Kevala Jnana, the seats of the Jina suddenly shook. All the gods and demons came and celebrated the glory of his Kevala Jnana - the festival of Jnana Kalyanak. ||60||

After that, for sixty-six days, the glorious Vardhaman Jineendra, dwelling in silence, came to the world-famous city of Rajagriha. ||61||

There, just as the sun ascends the eastern mountain, he ascended the Vipulachala, the holder of abundant wealth, to enlighten the people. ||62||

Then, knowing the news of the arrival of the Jina, the gods and demons from all directions filled the world, as if it were filled with the qualities of the Jina. ||63||

At that time, that Vipulachala, surrounded by the gods like Saudharma and others, was adorned, just as Mount Kailasa, presided over by the first Jina, Lord Rishabha, was adorned. ||64||

Then, the gods created three walls made of jewels, each having a main gate in each direction, making twelve towers. ||65||

They created a Samavasarana, a place for assembly, stretching for one yojana, adorned with twelve sections with walls of crystal. ||66||

The Lord, adorned with eight miracles and thirty-four wonders, resided in that Samavasarana. There, surrounded by the gods, Vardhaman was adorned like the moon surrounded by the planets. ||67||

Indrabhati, Agnibhati, Vayubhati, and Kaundinya, the learned ones, came to the Samavasarana of the Arhant, inspired by Indra. ||68||

All those learned ones, along with their five hundred disciples each, renounced all attachments to clothes and other things, and embraced restraint. ||69||

At that time, Chandana Kumari, the daughter of King Chetaka, adorned with a pure garment, became the leader of the Aryikas. ||70||

King Shrenik, along with his four-armed army, also arrived at the Samavasarana and bowed to the Jina, Lord Vardhaman, seated on the throne. ||71||

That Samavasarana of the Jina was adorned with umbrellas, fly whisks, fans, water pots, flags, mirrors, and auspicious symbols, the eight auspicious signs. ||72||

The devotees fasted during the day and, in the evening, ascended the sun-heated stone platform near the mountain peak. ||58||

The earth was adorned with eight auspicious articles, namely, umbrellas, fly whisks, fans, water pots, flags, mirrors, wings, and fans, and eight types of great flags with the symbols of garlands, wheels, white cloth, lotuses, elephants, lions, bulls, and Garuda, as well as with manastambhas, stupas, four great forests, groups of blooming lotuses in the tanks, and latagṛhas (bower-like structures) made of creepers in the creeper forests, and all other kinds of famous wonders created by the gods. ||72-75||
Just as the planets like Shukra, etc., are adorned near the moon, being presided over by the Guru, i.e., Brihaspati, in the same way, near Shri Vardhamana Jinendra, in the first corner, were adorned many munis, adorned with the spotless Digambara mudra, presided over by their respective diksha gurus, i.e., their own gurus. ||76||
Then, in the second corner, were situated the Kalpavasini goddesses, bearing arms like Kalpa creepers, and they were adorned near the Jinendra in the same way as the bhogabhūmis are adorned near Sumeru. ||77||
Then, in the third corner, a row of Aryikas, adorned with various ornaments, was adorned in the same way as a row of clouds in the autumn season, embraced by shining lightning. ||78||
After them, in the fourth corner, were adorned the women of the Jyotishka gods, bearing radiant bodies. They seemed like stars reflected in the ocean of Samavasarana. ||79||
Then, in the fifth corner, the women of the Vyantara gods, bearing hand-shaped earrings, were adorned like the very Lakshmi of the forest. ||80||

## The Second Chapter

Those adorned with crowns, earrings, armlets, necklaces, and waistbands, resembling Kalpa trees, were the Kalpavasis.  ||85||  Then, accompanied by their sons and daughters, and numerous Vidyadharas, humans of diverse languages, attire, and radiance sat there. ||86||  After them, serpents, mongooses, elephants, lions, horses, buffaloes, and others, all imbued with faith born from the influence of the Jina, sat there, peaceful and serene. ||87||  Thus, with twelve categories, they performed circumambulation, praise, and prostration around the Jina, who was present in the midst of them. ||88||  Having witnessed the essence of the universe and eradicated the three poisons of passion, aversion, and delusion, the Jina, Gautama, inquired about the path to liberation, the destroyer of sin. ||89||  The Jina, with a divine voice that shattered all doubts, a voice as deep as the sound of a drum, and reaching across leagues, ||90||  on the first day of the dark fortnight of Shraavana, under the Abhijit constellation, in the morning, began to preach the Dharma. ||91||  The valiant Lord spoke of the essence of the Acharanga, the Sutra-kritanga, the Stananga, the Samavayanga, the Vyākhyāprajñapti, the Jñātṛdharmakathā, the Śrāvakādhyayana, the Antakṛddaśa, the Anuttaropāpadaka Daśa, the Praśnavyākaraṇa, and the Vipaka-sutra, which is filled with purity. ||92-94||  Then, the omniscient Lord explained the twelfth Anga, the Drṣṭivāda, which contains the teachings of the three hundred and sixty-six sages and has five divisions. ||95||  The Lord of the world, the foremost among the knowers, first spoke of the Parikarma, the Sutra, the Pratyānuyoga, and the Pūrvagata. ||96||  Then, he spoke of the fourteen Pūrvas of the Pūrvagata: the Utpadapūrva, the Agrayāṇīyapūrva, the Vīryapravāda Pūrva, the Astināstīpravāda Pūrva, the Jñānapravāda Pūrva, the Satyapravāda Pūrva, the Ātma-pravāda Pūrva, the Karma-pravāda Pūrva, the Pratyākyāna Pūrva, the Vidyānuvāda Pūrva, the Kalyāṇa Pūrva, the Prāṇāvāya Pūrva, the Kriyāviśāla Pūrva, and the Lokabindu-sāra Pūrva. ||97-98||  Then, he spoke of the essence of the Chūlikā, the essence of the Sallokabindu-sāra, and the essence of the Viśāla, which is all-knowing. ||100||

Page #58:

He explained the nature, object, and fruit of the five knowledges: Mati (knowledge of perception), Shruta (knowledge of scriptures), Avadhi (clairvoyance), Manahparyaya (knowledge of the minds of others), and Kevala (omniscience). He also explained that the first two knowledges are indirect, while the last three are direct. ||106||

He then taught about the fourteen Margana-sthana (stages of the path), the fourteen Guna-sthana (stages of qualities), and the fourteen Jiva-samasa (stages of the soul), thereby explaining the Jiva-dravya (soul substance). ||107||

He then described the Dravya (substance) through the eight Anuyoga-dvara (gates of knowledge): Sat (being), Sankhya (number), Kshetra (space), Sparshan (touch), Kala (time), Antar (interior), Bhava (state), and Alp-bahutva (smallness and largeness). He also described the four Nikshepa (deposits): Nama (name), Sthapana (establishment), Dravya (substance), and Bhava (state). He explained that the Dravya, such as Pudgala (matter), are distinct from each other due to their unique characteristics. All Dravya are characterized by the three Lakshanas (characteristics): Utpad (production), Vyaya (destruction), and Dhrauvya (permanence). ||108||

He explained the two types of Karma-bandha (bondage of karma): Shubha (auspicious) and Ashubha (inauspicious), and their respective causes. He explained that Shubha-bandha leads to happiness, while Ashubha-bandha leads to suffering. He also explained the nature of Moksha (liberation), its cause, and its fruit, which is the manifestation of the eight Gunas (qualities): Ananta Jnana (infinite knowledge), etc. ||109||

He described the Lok (world) as the space where the fruit of bondage and liberation is experienced, and which is located in the midst of the infinite Aloka-akasha (space without light). He explained that the Lok is divided into three parts: Urddhva (upper), Madhya (middle), and Patala (lower). He also described the Aloka (space without light) as the space outside the Lok. ||110||

Then, the Ganadhara Gautama, who was endowed with the seven Riddhis (supernatural powers), listened to the words of the Jinesvara and composed the twelve-fold Anga scriptures, including the Upanga (auxiliary scriptures). ||111||

At that time, the beings of the three worlds who were assembled in the Samavasarana (congregation) were touched by the rays of the Jinesvara, who is like the sun, and they became radiant, like those who have awakened from sleep. Their Moha (delusion), which was like a deep sleep, vanished. ||112||

The beings of the Tiryanch (animal) and Manusya (human) realms, who were blinded by delusion, were awakened by the sound of the Jinesvara's words, which were like the vibration of his lips. ||113||

He described the Chulika (small hair-like particles) along with their properties. ||96-100||

In this way, the Jinesvara, Sri Jinenradeva, described the essence of the Anga scriptures, and then described the fourteen types of Anga-bahir (external to the Anga scriptures) in their true form. First, he described the Samayika, which is truly named, and then the twenty-four Stotras (hymns), the pure Vandana (worship), the Pratikramana (atonement), the Vainayika (conduct), the Vinaya (discipline), the Kritika karma (ritual acts), the Dasha Vaikalika (ten types of vows), the Uttaraadhyayana (study of the scriptures), the Kalpavyavahara (conduct of the Kalpa), the Kalpa-kalpa (the cycle of Kalpas), the Maha-kalpa (great Kalpa), the Pundarika (lotus), the Maha-pundarika (great lotus), and the Nishidhyaka (prohibited acts), which includes a detailed description of the Prayashchitta (atonement). The Jinesvara, the Guru of the three worlds, described these fourteen subjects for the benefit of all. ||101-105||

Then, the Jinesvara explained the nature, object, and fruit of the five knowledges: Mati (knowledge of perception), Shruta (knowledge of scriptures), Avadhi (clairvoyance), Manahparyaya (knowledge of the minds of others), and Kevala (omniscience). He also explained that the first two knowledges are indirect, while the last three are direct. ||106||

Then, he taught about the fourteen Margana-sthana (stages of the path), the fourteen Guna-sthana (stages of qualities), and the fourteen Jiva-samasa (stages of the soul), thereby explaining the Jiva-dravya (soul substance). ||107||

Then, he described the Dravya (substance) through the eight Anuyoga-dvara (gates of knowledge): Sat (being), Sankhya (number), Kshetra (space), Sparshan (touch), Kala (time), Antar (interior), Bhava (state), and Alp-bahutva (smallness and largeness). He also described the four Nikshepa (deposits): Nama (name), Sthapana (establishment), Dravya (substance), and Bhava (state). He explained that the Dravya, such as Pudgala (matter), are distinct from each other due to their unique characteristics. All Dravya are characterized by the three Lakshanas (characteristics): Utpad (production), Vyaya (destruction), and Dhrauvya (permanence). ||108||

He explained the two types of Karma-bandha (bondage of karma): Shubha (auspicious) and Ashubha (inauspicious), and their respective causes. He explained that Shubha-bandha leads to happiness, while Ashubha-bandha leads to suffering. He also explained the nature of Moksha (liberation), its cause, and its fruit, which is the manifestation of the eight Gunas (qualities): Ananta Jnana (infinite knowledge), etc. ||109||

He described the Lok (world) as the space where the fruit of bondage and liberation is experienced, and which is located in the midst of the infinite Aloka-akasha (space without light). He explained that the Lok is divided into three parts: Urddhva (upper), Madhya (middle), and Patala (lower). He also described the Aloka (space without light) as the space outside the Lok. ||110||

Then, the Ganadhara Gautama, who was endowed with the seven Riddhis (supernatural powers), listened to the words of the Jinesvara and composed the twelve-fold Anga scriptures, including the Upanga (auxiliary scriptures). ||111||

At that time, the beings of the three worlds who were assembled in the Samavasarana (congregation) were touched by the rays of the Jinesvara, who is like the sun, and they became radiant, like those who have awakened from sleep. Their Moha (delusion), which was like a deep sleep, vanished. ||112||

The beings of the Tiryanch (animal) and Manusya (human) realms, who were blinded by delusion, were awakened by the sound of the Jinesvara's words, which were like the vibration of his lips. ||113||

He described the Chulika (small hair-like particles) along with their properties. ||96-100||

## Second Chapter

Then, the essence of the teachings of the Jinas, the characteristics of faith in the path, which is radiant with the absence of doubts, desires, and blemishes like giving, etc., were explained.  || 114 || The jewel of right faith, the leader of the ornaments of knowledge, was held in their ears and hearts by all beings. || 115 ||  Having carefully observed the differences in body, senses, qualities, the abode of the soul, lineage, and lifespan, as well as the various possibilities of wombs, through the eye of the scriptures, || 116 || the abandonment of killing, binding, etc., in actions, beginning with the place of the soul, is called the first great vow of non-violence for the six categories of living beings. || 117 || Speech that causes suffering to others due to attachment, aversion, or delusion, is to be abandoned.  The second great vow of truth is the cessation of such speech. || 118 || The third great vow of non-stealing is the abandonment of taking what is not given, whether it be little or much, from another's property. || 119 || The abandonment of sexual intercourse with women and men, through actions, causing, or approving, is called the fourth great vow of celibacy. || 120 || The fifth great vow of non-possession is the detachment from all external and internal possessions, due to the faults of possession. || 121 || The first vow of restraint from harming living beings within sight is considered to purify the vows. || 122 ||  The speech of the ascetic who always strives to avoid harsh and cruel words in religious activities is called the vow of speech. || 123 || The taking of food by the ascetic, after purifying the body, for the sake of the body's stability, is called the vow of food. || 124 || The vow of taking and placing is the taking and placing of a suitable object after careful consideration. || 125 || The vow of purification is the elimination of waste from the body in suitable places. || 126 || Thus, there are five vows and three secrets, which are the pure forms of the activities of speech, mind, and body. || 127 || The control of the mind and senses, equality, bowing, praise, confession, self-study, and bodily relaxation are the six essential practices.  Shaving the hair, bathing, and single-minded devotion, as well as the practice of standing, sitting, and lying down, are also important. || 128 ||

Page #60:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, it is stated that the following are the tenets of Jainism:

* **Earth-bed vow:** Sleeping on the ground.
* **Tooth-paste avoidance vow:** Avoiding the use of toothpaste.
* **Twelve types of austerities:**  
* **Twelve types of self-restraint:** 
* **Conquest of the senses:** 
* **Twelve types of introspection:** 
* **Ten virtues:**  
* **Service to knowledge, vision, conduct, and austerity:** 
* **Service to humility:** 

This is the path of the Shramanas, which leads to the liberation from karma. This path was preached by the Jinas to the gods, demons, and humans. 

Hundreds of humans, who were afraid of the cycle of birth and death, who were pure in their lineage, form, and family, and who were free from all attachments, accepted this path. 

Thousands of pure women, who were pure in their vision and had a single pure garment, took the vow of an Aryika. 

Some men and women took the five Anuvratas, the three Gunavratas, and the four Shikshavrata, making a total of twelve vows for lay followers. 

Even the animals followed the rules as much as they could. The gods were immersed in the worship of the Jinas, their vision, and their knowledge. 

King Shrenik, due to his previous actions of excessive beginnings and attachments, had earned the seventh hell, called Tamas-Tamah. However, due to the power of his क्षायिक सम्यग्दर्शन (क्षायिक samyak-darshan), he attained the middle state of existence, which lasts for eighty-four thousand years. 

Gautama Swami says, "Where are the thirty-three oceans, and where is this lowly state? Oh, the extraordinary power of क्षायिक सम्यग्दर्शन (kshayik samyak-darshan)!"

King Shrenik's sons, Akrur, Varishena, Abhayakumar, and others, their mothers, and many other women in the palace, took the vows of सम्यग्दर्शन (samyak-darshan), good conduct, charity, medicine, and worship, and bowed to the Trijagadguru, Lord Vardhaman Jinendra. 

Then, Indra, after praising Lord Jinendra, bowed to him and, along with his family, went to their respective places. 

King Shrenik, who had attained the highest level of emotions, also praised and bowed to Lord Vardhaman Jinendra and, with a satisfied mind, entered the city. 

Just as the ocean is adorned with the floods of rivers during the time of the tide, so too...

## Second Chapter

The assembly hall was always filled with people entering and exiting.  Just as the sun's disc is never devoid of its vast rays, so too was the assembly hall always filled with people.  [144]  The rising and setting of the sun could not be perceived there due to the brilliance of the Dharmachakra and the Prabhamandal.  [145]  The Tirthankara, residing on the Vipulachal, delivered sermons every day.  The King Shrenik served him daily, for the enjoyment of the three worlds cannot bring true satisfaction.  [146]  Having met Gautama Ganadhara, the King became proficient in all the Anuyogas through his teachings.  [147]  Thereafter, King Shrenik filled the city of Rajgriha, both inside and outside, with towering Jin temples, where glory and festivities constantly took place.  [148]  The King's devoted Samantas, Mahamantris, Purohitas, and other people of the kingdom filled the entire Magadha region with Jin temples.  [149]  In cities, villages, towns, at the foot of mountains, on riverbanks, and in the depths of forests, Jin temples were everywhere to be seen.  [150]  Thus, the great Lord Vardhamana Jinendra, the sun who destroys the darkness of ignorance, who ends the winter of false knowledge, and who is adorned with the Prabhamandal of knowledge, enlightened the people of the eastern region, including the people of Magadha, and then, with the same glory, proceeded towards the vast middle region, the abode of midday splendor.  [151]

Thus ends the second chapter, titled "Dharma Tirtha Pravartana," in the Harivansha Purana, composed by Acharya Jinaseena, which contains the collection of the Purana of Lord Arishtanemi.  [2]

## The Third Chapter

The propagation of the Dharma Tirtha by the Jineshvara in Madhya Desha (Central India) dispelled the ignorance about the Tirtha in all the countries. ||1||

Just as the polluted ponds become pure upon the rise of the Agastya constellation in the world, similarly, upon the rise of the Jineshvara, the polluted hearts of the people became pure. ||2||

Just as the glorious Lord Rishabhadeva, the beloved of the noble ones, had previously wandered through many countries and imbued them with Dharma, similarly, Lord Mahavira, adorned with magnificence, wandered through the countries of Kashi, Kaushal, Kaushalya, Kusandhya, Asvastha, Salwa, Trigart, Panchal, Bhadrakar, Patacchara, Mauka, Matsya, Kaniya, Surasen, and Vrikarthaka in the middle country, and the countries of Kalinga, Kurujangala, Kaikeya, Atreya, Kamboja, Bahrika, Yavana, Sindhu, Gandhara, Sauvira, Sura, Bhir, Daroruka, Vadavana, Bharadvaja, and Kwathatosha on the seacoast, and the countries of Tana, Karna, and Prachhala in the north, and imbued them with Dharma. ||3-7||

When the radiant sun of the Jineshvara, spreading the light of pure knowledge, shone brightly, where did the splendor of the various false Dharma-like fireflies disappear? It was not known. ||8||

At that time, those who had seen the body of Lord Vardhamana Jineshvara, heard his divine voice, and witnessed his magnificence, had no attachment to the words of other men. ||9||

They were naturally adorned with the ten great qualities: a body free from impurities and excretions, absence of sweat, blood like cow's milk, a body like a vajra (diamond), a square body, a very beautiful form, an extraordinary fragrance, a body with one thousand and eight auspicious marks, infinite strength, and words that were beneficial and pleasing. ||10-11||

And, upon attaining perfect knowledge, they were adorned with eyes that were always calm and wide open, nails and hair that were perfectly arranged and lustrous, absence of a throat, absence of old age, no shadow of their body, and a single, perfectly radiant face. ||12||

## The Third Canto
### The Family

1. 
"Free from the enjoyment of food, past old age, and shade, yet radiant with the brilliance of shade; with one face, yet beautiful with four faces; extending over two hundred yojanas, bringing about abundance; free from calamities and the suffering of beings, traversing the sky; the source of all knowledge, wondrous due to the destruction of karma; seen and heard, the body of the Jina, who brought happiness to the world." || 33, 14, 15 ||

"Drinking the Ardhamagadhi language, like a stream of nectar, from their ear-lobes, the Jains satisfied the beings of the three worlds." || 16 ||

"Even those who were unable to bear each other's scent, due to enmity, became friendly everywhere on the earth." || 17 ||

"As if eager to reach first, the six seasons, with all their trees laden with fruits and flowers, served him." || 18 ||

"The earth, adorned with all jewels, radiant like a pure mirror, shone as if displaying her inner purity to the Jina." || 19 ||

"The gentle breeze, fragrant and conducive to wandering, blew, as if serving the glorious Vira." || 20 ||

"The Jina, the supreme friend, wandered for the benefit of others, and at that time, supreme joy arose for all beings." || 21 ||

"The Vayu-Kumaras, the gods, made the earth within a yojana free from thorns, stones, and insects." || 22 ||

"After them, the thunderous Stanita-Kumaras, the gods, took the form of clouds and showered auspicious fragrant water." || 23 ||

"The Jina's lotus feet were worshipped at every step by seven lotuses, as if the earth itself was ascending and descending through the sky." || 24 ||

"The earth shone with a multitude of grains, like barley, bearing fruits, as if trembling with joy at the sight of the Jina." || 25 ||

6. 
To be visible everywhere, abundance in the earth extending to two hundred yojanas, absence of calamities, absence of suffering of beings, meaning absence of cruelty, traversing the sky, and being the master of all knowledge, these ten atishyas, born from the destruction of karma, were generating even more wonder. At that time, the body of the Jina, seen or heard, was generating happiness for the beings of the world. || 10 - 15 ||

The beings of the three worlds were satisfied, drinking the Ardhamagadhi language of the Lord, like a stream of nectar, from their ear-lobes, which could transform into all languages. || 16 ||

Deep friendship arose everywhere on the earth among beings who were enemies, unable to bear each other's scent. || 17 ||

The six seasons, with all their trees constantly laden with fruits and flowers, were as if serving him, with the feeling, "I will reach first, I will reach first." || 18 ||

The earth, adorned with all jewels, radiant like a pure mirror, shone as if displaying her inner purity to the Jina. || 19 ||

The gentle breeze, fragrant and conducive to wandering, blew, as if serving the Lord, generating a pleasant touch on the body. || 20 ||

At that time, supreme joy arose for all beings in the world, as the glorious Jina, the supreme friend, wandered for the benefit of others. || 21 ||

The Vayu-Kumaras, the gods, were making the earth within a yojana free from thorns, stones, and insects. || 22 ||

After them, the thunderous Stanita-Kumaras, the gods, took the form of clouds and showered auspicious fragrant water. || 23 ||

The Lord was traversing the sky, like the earth, and his lotus feet were worshipped at every step by seven lotuses. Meaning - While wandering, fifteen rows of lotuses were arranged, seven before and seven behind, and one under the feet of the Lord, making a total of two hundred and twenty-five lotuses. || 24 ||

The earth shone with a multitude of grains, like barley, bearing fruits, as if trembling with joy at the sight of the Jina. || 25 ||

---------------------------
26. The sky, devoid of the veil of clouds, shone brightly, as if imitating the purity of the Jina's omniscience. 27. Just as women, free from impurities, worship their husbands day and night, so too did the directions, cleansed of dust, worship the Lord. 28. By Indra's command, the gods proclaimed the Jina's gift of Dharma, calling upon others from all sides. 29. Whether in motion or at rest, the Dharmachakra, radiant like the sun, with a thousand rays, shone brightly before the Jina, outshining the wheel of the Chakravartin. 30. Thus, adorned with fourteen divine wonders and eight auspicious symbols, the Jina, the great Mahavira, walked upon the earth. 31. The Ashoka tree, the first of the eight wonders, shone brightly, as if the entire world, or the sky itself, were bowing to the Lord. What greater glory could there be? 32. The earth in all directions was adorned with showers of flowers, falling from the hands of the gods, their heads bowed in reverence. 33. The Jina, adorned with sixty-four fly whisks by the gods in all four directions, shone brightly, like Mount Meru adorned with the waves of the Ganges. 34. The Lord's halo, which had banished the difference between night and day, outshone the sun's disc with its brilliance. 35. The sound of the drums echoed through the heavens, the path of the gods, as if proclaiming to the world that the Jina had conquered the enemy of karma. 36. The Lord, who had renounced the earthly sovereignty of a single umbrella, now possessed the sovereignty of the three worlds, adorned with three umbrellas. 37. The Lord, who had abandoned the throne surrounded by kings, now possessed another throne, surrounded by the Indra's. 38. The Jina's divine voice, which spread for a yojana, was a nectar for the mind and ears, purifying the three worlds.

## The Third Chapter:

**27.** Having traversed many lands with miraculous powers and other attributes, the Lord, revered by the gods, arrived in the Magadha region. **39.** He was accompanied by eleven Ganadharas, all possessing seven types of wealth and masters of all scriptures. **40.** The first Ganadhara was called Indrabhuti, the second Agnibhuti, the third Vayubhuti, the fourth Shuchidatta, the fifth Sudharma, the sixth Mandavya, the seventh Mauryaputra, the eighth Akampana, the ninth Achal, the tenth Medary, and the last Prabhas. **41.** All these Ganadharas were endowed with the tapas of Taptdeepta and others, and possessed four types of powers: Buddhi, Vikriya, Akshina, and Oushadhi, Rasa, and Bala. **42-44.** The first five Ganadharas each had two thousand one hundred and thirty disciples, the sixth and seventh had four hundred and twenty-five each, and the remaining four had six hundred and twenty-five each. Thus, the total number of disciples of the eleven Ganadharas was fourteen thousand. **45-46.** Among these fourteen thousand disciples, three hundred were holders of the previous knowledge, nine hundred possessed Vikriya power, thirteen hundred were Avadhi-knowing, seven hundred were Kevala-knowing, five hundred possessed Vipulamati and Manahparyaya knowledge, four hundred were victorious debaters, and nine thousand nine hundred were teachers. **47-50.** Thus, the assembly of fourteen thousand monks, led by the Lord Jinendra and accompanied by eleven Ganadharas, shone like the ocean with its flowing rivers. **51.** The Lord Vardhamana Jinendra, accompanied by the awe-inspiring Lakshmi, arrived in the city of Rajgriha, which was like the home of Lakshmi and adorned with many excellent houses. **52.** The city of Rajgriha is also known as Panchashalapur because it has five hills. It is sanctified by the birth of the Lord Munisuvrat, is impregnable to enemy forces, and is adorned by five mountains. **53.** The first of these five mountains is called Rishigiri. It is square-shaped, adorned with cascading waterfalls, and beautifies the eastern direction like the tusk of the elephant king Airavata. **54.** The second mountain, called Vaibhar, is located in the south and is triangular in shape. It is vast and occupies the south-western direction.

Page #66:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, the third mountain, Vipulachala, is situated between the south and west directions and is triangular in shape, similar to Vaibharagiri. ||54|| The fourth mountain, Valahka, is shaped like a bow with a string and encompasses three directions. The fifth mountain, Panduka, is round and adorns the space between the east and north directions. ||55|| All these mountains are adorned with creepers that are bent down by the weight of fruits and flowers, and they are beautiful with the groups of waterfalls falling down. ||56|| Except for Vasupujya Jinendra, the great forests of these five mountains have been sanctified by the Samavasaranas of all other Tirthankaras. ||57|| These forests are served by the groups of many glorious beings who have come for pilgrimage, and they are sanctified by the Siddhakshetras associated with various miracles. ||58||

Then, on the Vipulachala mountain, where Indra had already made all the arrangements for the Samavasarana, the glorious Vardhamana Jinendra, the possessor of immense wealth, went and sat in majesty. ||59|| At that time, the mountain was adorned with the presence of the gods like Saudharma and the humans like Srenika, and it was filled with gods and humans. ||60|| The Rishis, who possessed Siddhis, sat first near the glorious Jinendra Bhagavan. After them sat the Yatis who had ended their Kshayas, the Munis who were omniscient and had attained the knowledge of the transcendental, and the countless Anagaras. In this way, there were fourteen thousand Munis, thirty-five thousand Aryikas, one lakh Shravakas, thirty lakh Shravikas, four types of gods and goddesses, and the Tiryanchas, all seated in their respective places, along with eleven Ganadharas. The Bhagavan was adorned by all these twelve assemblies. ||61-64||

Then, when the beings of the three worlds were seated in their respective places, desiring to hear the Dharma, the glorious Tirthankara Bhagavan began to preach the Dharma, after being asked by the Ganadhara. ||65|| He said that there are two types of beings, the Siddha and the Samsari, in a general sense, and both these types are endowed with the characteristic of being useful. And in terms of specifics, both of them possess infinite and countless differences. ||66|| Those who have attained the liberation that is worthy of being attained through the means of Samyagdarshan, Samyagjnana, and Samyakcharitra, and who have attained their true nature, are situated in the front part of the Siddhakshetra-loka, in the Tanuvat-valaya, which is the holder.

Page #67:
---------------------------
The third chapter deals with the destruction of the five types of knowledge-obscuring karma, the nine types of perception-obscuring karma, the two types of vedaniya karma (due to the difference between saata and asaata), the twenty-eight types of mohaniya karma, the four types of ayush karma, the forty-two types of name karma, the two types of gotra karma, and the five types of antaraya karma.  Upon destroying these karmas, they become merged with the infinite number of previous Siddhas and reside on the top of the three worlds.  They are characterized by samyaktva, infinite knowledge, infinite perception, infinite power, extreme subtlety, natural understanding, uninterrupted infinite bliss, and lightness.  They are known for their eight qualities, are countless in number, and are formless due to the destruction of the twenty qualities related to pudgala.  They have a form slightly smaller than the last body, are like the space within a wax mold, and are free from birth, old age, death, undesirable things, association, separation from the desired, hunger, thirst, disease, and all other sufferings.  They are free from the five types of transformations, which are based on the differences in substance, field, time, existence, and state, and are therefore blissful in nature.  

The asiddhas, or worldly beings, are of three types: asanyata,  sanyatasanyata, and sanyata.  The asanyata state is in the first four gunasthanas, the sanyatasanyata state is in the fifth gunastana, and the sanyata state is in the nine gunasthanas from the sixth to the fourteenth.  

The jiva, residing in the parinaamic state, is engaged in the gunasthanas due to the arising, destruction, subsidence, or destruction-subsidence of mohaniya karma.  There are fourteen gunasthanas, of which the first is mithyadristi, which is considered to be the one that bears the name "meaningful," the second is saasadan, the third is misra, the fourth is asanyata samyagdristi, the fifth is sanyatasanyata, the sixth is pramatta sanyata, the seventh is aprammatta sanyata, the eighth is apuurvakarana, the ninth is anivrittikarana, the tenth is sukshmasampraaya, the eleventh is upashanta kshaya, the twelfth is kshinamoha, the thirteenth is sayogakevali, and the fourteenth is ayogakevali.  Of these, the three gunasthanas from apuurvakarana to anivrittikarana, which are prior to upashanta kshaya, are both of the upashamak and kshapak types.  

There is no difference in the external form of those who reside in the nine gunasthanas from the sixth to the fourteenth.

Page #68:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, there are five stages of spiritual progress, known as Gunasthanas, where the difference lies in the degree of restraint (Samyata) and unrestraint (Asamyata). Just as there is a difference in outward appearance, there is also a difference in the purity of the soul as one progresses through these stages.

The highest level of happiness is experienced by the Sayoga Kevali and Ayoga Kevali, who have attained the ultimate liberation (Kshayika Labdhi). Their happiness is infinite and not derived from sensory pleasures.

Next in line are the A-poorva Karana and the Kshapaka, who experience supreme happiness arising from the suppression or destruction of the passions (Kshaya).

Following them are the restrained (Samyata) and unrestrained (Asamyata) beings who are free from the fifteen distractions (Pramada) of sleep, five senses, four passions, four doubts, and one attachment. They experience a state of tranquility (Prashama).

Then come the restrained beings who are free from the five vices of violence, falsehood, stealing, sexual misconduct, and attachment. They experience a state of peace (Shama).

Further down are the restrained and unrestrained beings who have renounced the five vices to some extent. They experience happiness due to their victory over the great thirst (Mahatrishna).

Even those who are not completely free from the vices, but have faith in the truth (Tattva Shraddha), experience happiness.

Those who are simultaneously on the path of right faith (Samyakta) and wrong faith (Mithyatva) experience a mixture of happiness and sorrow.

Those who have abandoned right faith (Samyakta) experience a fleeting sense of happiness, similar to the taste of sugar mixed with milk and ghee, which is felt only momentarily after burping.

Those who are deeply deluded by the seven-fold nature of ignorance (Moha) are like a person in a dream state. They are far from experiencing true happiness.

In essence, the Gunasthanas represent the different stages of the soul's evolution, driven by the influence of ignorance (Moha) and the path of liberation (Yoga). The first twelve Gunasthanas are marked by the influence of ignorance, while the last two are characterized by liberation.

## Third Chapter

**2. The Yoga of the Two Qualities**

There are four states of the Karma of delusion: 1. Arise (Uday), 2. Subside (Upasham), 3. Destruction (Kshaya), and 4. Destruction-Subside (Kshayopa-sham). These states are briefly described here. Due to these states, there is a difference in the results of the soul.

**Arise (Uday):** When the obstacles of Arise are complete, the Karma, according to its nature, field, time, and feeling, starts giving its fruits. This is called Arise.

**Subside (Upasham):** When the power of the Karma to give its fruits is hidden for a moment, it is called Subside. Just as the mud in water settles down due to alum or alum-like substances, and the water becomes clear, similarly, when the appropriate conditions of nature, field, etc., are met, the power of the Karma to give its fruits is hidden.

**Destruction (Kshaya):** The complete destruction of the Karma-natures is called Destruction. Just as when the particles of mud are completely removed from dirty water, permanent purity is achieved, similarly, when the Karma-particles are completely removed, permanent purity arises in the soul.

**Destruction-Subside (Kshayopa-sham):** When the destructive competitors that arise in the present time are in the state of non-arising (destruction), and the fruits that are to arise in the future are in the state of permanent existence (subside), and the destructive nature is in the state of arising, this is called Destruction-Subside.

The feelings of the soul in the states of Arise, etc., of the Karma-natures are called Audaik, Aupashamik, Kshayik, and Kshayopa-shamik feelings respectively. Those feelings that are not caused by the above-mentioned states of Karma are called Pari-naamik feelings.

Now, the brief nature of the qualities is described:

**1. False-Vision (Mithyadrishti):** The soul that has the Arise of the seven natures of Falsehood (Mithyatva), Mixed-Truth (Samyag-mithyatva), Truth (Samyak-tva), and the infinite-bound anger, pride, deceit, and greed, and due to this, has the belief in untruth, is called False-Vision. This soul does not have the knowledge of self and others, nor does it have faith in the truth taught by the Jinas, nor does it have faith in the scriptures and the Nigrantha Guru.

**2. Slightly-Stable True-Vision (Sasa-dan Samyag-drishti):** When the soul is in the state of True-Vision, and there are six Avali (a period of time) remaining, and the Arise of any one of the infinite-bound anger, pride, deceit, and greed occurs, then the soul falls from the fourth quality to the below, but has not yet reached the False-Vision quality. This is called Slightly-Stable quality. Due to the Arise of the infinite-bound, the True-Vision becomes slightly-stable, i.e., it is accompanied by opposition.

**3. Mixed (Mishra):** If the Arise of the Mixed-Truth (Samyag-mithyatva) nature occurs during the time of True-Vision, then the soul can fall from the fourth quality to the third Mixed quality. Just as the taste of mixed curd and jaggery is mixed, similarly, the result of the soul in this quality is also mixed with Truth and Falsehood. The soul that has been False-Vision from the beginning (Anadi Mithyadrishti) comes to the third quality only after falling from the fourth quality, but the soul that has become False-Vision later (Sadi Mithyadrishti) can reach the third quality even from the first quality.

**4. Uncontrolled True-Vision (Asanyata Samyag-drishti):** The soul that has been False-Vision from the beginning (Anadi Mithyadrishti), and has the Subside, etc., of the five natures of Falsehood (Mithyatva) and the infinite-bound anger, pride, deceit, and greed, and the soul that has become False-Vision later (Sadi Mithyadrishti), and has the Subside, etc., of the seven or five natures of Falsehood (Mithyatva), Mixed-Truth (Samyag-mithyatva), Truth (Samyak-tva), and the infinite-bound anger, pride, deceit, and greed, and has the belief in truth, but due to the Arise of the passions like the non-rejection covering, etc., the feeling of control has not awakened, is called Uncontrolled True-Vision.

**5. Controlled-Uncontrolled (Sanyata-sanyata):** When the passion of non-rejection covering has the state of Destruction-Subside, and one part of the character is revealed, it is called Controlled-Uncontrolled. This soul is free from violence, therefore, it is controlled.

## Chapter 32: Harivansh Purana

**32**

In the Harivansh Purana, it is said that a being who is not free from violence towards stationary beings is called **Asanyata** (unrestrained). There are eleven **Avantaar** (sub-divisions) based on the difference in the **Kshayopa-sham** (cessation of the obscuration) of **Pratyakhyana-avaran** (obscuration of rejection) and the **Uday** (arising) of **Pratyakhyana-avaran** Kshaya.

**6. Pramatta-Sanayata:** A being whose soul exhibits **Sanayma** (restraint) along with **Pramād** (heedlessness) due to the **Kshayopa-sham** (cessation) of **Pratyakhyana-avaran** Kshaya and the intense **Uday** (arising) of **Sanjwalan** (flames) is called **Pramatta-Sanayata**. The holder of this **Ganasthan** (stage of being) resides in the **Nagan Mudra** (naked posture). Although this being has abandoned all sins like violence, the intense **Uday** (arising) of the four **Sanjwalan** (flames) along with it makes its conduct **Chitrala-Dushita** (stained) due to fifteen **Pramād** (heedlessness) - four **Vikatha** (delusions), four **Kshaya** (passions), five **Indriya** (senses), **Nidra** (sleep) and **Sneha** (attachment).

**7. Apramatta-Sanayata:** A being whose soul is free from the fifteen types of **Pramād** (heedlessness) mentioned above due to the cessation of the intense **Uday** (arising) of **Sanjwalan** (flames) is called **Apramatta-Sanayata**. There are two types of this being: **Swasthan** (in its own place) and **Sati-shaya** (with excess). The one that remains in the sixth and seventh **Gunasthan** (stage of being) is called **Swasthan**, and the one that is undergoing **Adha-karan** (lowering) transformation to ascend to a higher **Gunasthan** is called **Sati-shaya Apramatta-Sanayata**. **Adha-karan** refers to the transformation of beings that are either simultaneous or different in time, and can be similar or dissimilar.

**8. A-purva-karan:** A being whose transformation is always **A-purva** (new) and **Navin** (fresh) at every moment is called **A-purva-karan**. In this, the transformation of simultaneous beings can be similar or dissimilar, but the transformation of beings different in time is always dissimilar.

**9. Ani-vritti-karan:** A being whose transformation is similar for simultaneous beings and dissimilar for beings different in time is called **Ani-vritti-karan**. These transformations, starting from **A-purva-karan**, are progressively purer and manifest with the gradual decrease in the **Uday** (arising) of the four **Sanjwalan** (flames).

**10. Sukshma-Samparaya:** A being where only the subtle **Uday** (arising) of **Sanjwalan** **Lobha** (greed) remains is called **Sukshma-Samparaya**. From the eighth **Gunasthan** (stage of being), two categories emerge: **Upshama** (cessation) and **Kshapaka** (destruction). Those who strive to achieve the **Upshama** (cessation) of **Charitra** (conduct) **Moha** (delusion) are in the **Upshama** category, and those who strive to achieve the **Kshaya** (destruction) of **Charitra** **Moha** are in the **Kshapaka** category. Based on the state of their transformation, a being enters either the **Upshama** or **Kshapaka** category, not by conscious choice. Only **Kshayika** (permanent) **Samyag-drishti** (right faith) can enter the **Kshapaka** category, while both **Aupasha-mika** (temporary) and **Kshayika** **Samyag-drishti** can enter the **Upshama** category. The special feature here is that an **Aupasha-mika** **Samyag-drishti** entering the **Upshama** category will become a **Dvitiya-Aupasha-mika** (second temporary) **Samyag-drishti** by removing the **Ananta-anubandhi** (infinite attachments) from existence before entering the category. A being entering the **Upshama** category achieves the **Upshama** (cessation) of **Charitra** **Moha** by the end of the **Sukshma-Samparaya** **Gunasthan**, while a being entering the **Kshapaka** category achieves the **Kshaya** (destruction) of **Charitra** **Moha**.

**11. Upshanta-Moha:** A being in the **Upshama** category achieves the complete **Upshama** (cessation) of **Charitra** **Moha** in the tenth **Gunasthan** and enters the eleventh **Upshanta-Moha** **Gunasthan**. Its **Moha** (delusion) is completely pacified, and its beauty is like a lake in the autumn season. After staying in this **Gunasthan** for a short time, the being falls back down.

## The Third Chapter

**95.** By the nature of the karma-pāṭa, which covers right knowledge, and by the nature of the darśana-āvaraṇa, which obstructs the highest vision, and by the other, which is like a doorkeeper.

**16.** By the nature of the vedanīya, which is like a sword smeared with honey, holding the sharpness of its edge, and by the nature of the mohanīya, which is like wine, causing great confusion.

**9.** By the nature of the āyu-karma, which is like a strong chain, holding one to a fixed course, and by the nature of the nāma-karma, which is like a painter, creating diverse forms.

**18.** By the nature of the gotra-karma, which is like a potter, making the low and the high, and by the nature of the antarāya-karma, which is like a storekeeper, obstructing the attainment of desirable things.

**19.** Thus, by the eightfold division of karma, which bears fruit, beings are bound in the mithyā-dṛṣṭi guṇa-sthāna.

**10.** In the thirteen guṇa-sthānas, there is a regular progression of auspiciousness for beings. In the first guṇa-sthāna, there is both auspiciousness and inauspiciousness.

**12.** The being who has destroyed the kṣoṇa-moha and is in the श्रेणी-vāla guṇa-sthāna, destroys the cāritra-moha in the tenth guṇa-sthāna and enters the twelfth guṇa-sthāna, the kṣīṇa-moha guṇa-sthāna. Here, his moha is completely destroyed, and his purity is like that of clear water in a crystal vessel.

**13.** At the end of the twelfth guṇa-sthāna, the being enters the thirteenth guṇa-sthāna by the influence of the second pāda of śukla-dhyāna, simultaneously destroying the karma of jñāna-āvaraṇa, etc. Here, he attains perfect knowledge and is therefore called a kevalī. Because the yogas continue to function, he is called a sayoga-kevalī. He is known by this name because of both these characteristics.

**14.** Those whose yogas cease to function are called ayoga-kevalī. This being remains in this guṇa-sthāna for the amount of time it takes to pronounce the five short vowels, "a, i, u, ṛ, l." Then, by the influence of the fourth pāda of śukla-dhyāna, he destroys the eighty-five prakṛtis that are present in his being and reaches the siddha-kṣetra in a single moment.

Ācārya Jinasena has also considered the gradation of happiness in these fourteen guṇa-sthānas. Happiness is a quality of the soul and is always present in it, but its manifestation changes due to the rise of moha. Therefore, as the contact of moha with the soul becomes more distant, the quality of happiness begins to manifest in its natural form. The mithyā-dṛṣṭi being has a complete manifestation of moha, so it is said that he has no happiness at all. The happiness that is seen in the mithyā-dṛṣṭi being is not its natural form, but only its potential form. In the twelfth guṇa-sthāna, the contact of moha is completely lost, so happiness manifests in its natural form there. However, there is a lack of infinite knowledge to experience that happiness, so it is not called infinite happiness. When perfect knowledge arises, that same happiness is called infinite happiness.

**1.** The eight types of karma are: jñāna-āvaraṇa, darśana-āvaraṇa, vedanīya, mohanīya, āyu, nāma, gotra, and antarāya. Of these, the jñāna-āvaraṇa karma is like a karma-pāṭa, covering right knowledge. The darśana-āvaraṇa karma is like a doorkeeper, obstructing the highest vision. The vedanīya karma is like a sword smeared with honey, holding the sharpness of its edge. The mohanīya karma is like wine, causing confusion in the mind. The āyu-karma is like a strong chain, holding one to a fixed course. The nāma-karma is like a painter, creating diverse forms. The gotra-karma is like a potter, making the low and the high. The antarāya-karma is like a storekeeper, obstructing the attainment of desirable things. Thus, by these eight types of karma, which bear fruit, these beings are constantly bound in the mithyā-dṛṣṭi guṇa-sthāna. **95-99.**

## Chapter 34

**The Harivamsha Purana**

Those who attain **Samyak Darshan**, **Samyak Jnana**, and **Samyak Charitra** are capable of attaining liberation and are called **Bhavya**. Those who are opposite to these are called **Abhavya**.  || 101 ||

Those who possess the characteristics of pure **Samyak Darshan**, **Samyak Jnana**, and **Samyak Charitra** are **Asanna Bhavya** (near Bhavya), and their **Asanna Bhavya** state can be known by modern men. However, **Dūra Bhavya** (distant Bhavya) and **Abhavya** can only be known through the words of **Āpta Bhagavan** (a perfect being), as it is not the subject of ordinary beings' reasoning. || 102-103 ||

This **Bhavya** and **Abhavya** state is the natural consequence of the **Jiva**'s nature, similar to **Chutanmasha** (sprouted mung beans) and **Kankatuka Atmamasha** (unsprouted mung beans) placed in a single vessel for roasting. The **Bhavya Jiva** attains the **Siddh Paryaya** (perfect state) upon receiving the necessary cause, while the **Abhavya Jiva**, despite receiving external causes, does not attain the **Siddh Paryaya** due to their lack of qualification. || 104 ||

The ocean of existence for **Bhavya Jivas** is **Anadi** (beginningless) and **Antavan** (finite), and is **Anadi Ananta** (beginningless and infinite) compared to ordinary **Bhavya Jivas**. || 105 ||

The ocean of existence for the multitude of **Abhavya Jivas** is **Anadi Ananta** (beginningless and infinite) both individually and collectively. || 106 ||

There are two multitudes of **Jivas** in the world: **Bhavya** and **Abhavya**. Both these multitudes are infinite, suffer due to the arising of **Mithyatva Karma** (false belief karma), and are **Akshaya** (imperishable) like **Kala Dravya** (time and matter). Just as **Kala Dravya** never ends, these two multitudes also never end. || 107 ||

These **Jivas** are **Nitya** (eternal) in terms of **Dravya** (substance) and **Anitya** (non-eternal) in terms of **Paryaya** (state), and are **Ubayatmaka** (both eternal and non-eternal) in terms of both. They are polluted by **Mithyatva**, **Avirati** (non-restraint), **Yoga** (attachment), and **Kashaya** (passions), and continuously bind **Papa Karma** (sinful karma) which is difficult to shed, causing them to wander through the four **Gatis** (states of existence) in suffering. || 108-109 ||

Those whose souls are constantly polluted by **Roudra Dhyana** (violent meditation), who are full of **Aarambha** (beginnings) and **Pari Graha** (attachment), who suffer from the eight **Mada** (pride) such as **Mithya Darshan** (false belief) and **Jnana Mada** (pride of knowledge), whose vision is extremely **Anishta** (unfavorable), who are eager for self-praise, who are **Nindya** (condemnable), who find joy in the condemnation of others, who are greedy for the possessions of others, and who are excessively attached to **Bhoga** (enjoyment) ... || 110-111 ||

**Chutanmasha** and **Kankatuka Atmamasha** are **Chutanmasha Kankatuka Atmamasha**. They are **Ekadhara** (in one vessel), just like those **Chutanmasha Kankatuka Atmamasha**. In one vessel, some **Chutanmasha** are produced, while others, **Kankatuka Atmamasha**, are not produced, just like them. || 111 ||

## The Third Chapter

**35.** Those who are greedy for wealth and possessions, who are consumed by desires for pleasures, who consume honey, meat, and alcohol, such human beings born on the earth, and the animals like tigers and lions, bind themselves to the hellish existence. ||113||

**13.** Those who are born in the hellish realms, where the body is constantly burned by extreme heat and cold, are filled with anger and their bodies are torn apart. ||113||

**11.** There is no substance, no place, no time, where the suffering of the hellish beings can find rest. ||114||

**115.** The only benefit for these hellish beings is that they do not die prematurely. For all living beings in the universe, a long life is desirable, and this long life is easily available to the hellish beings. ||115||

**116.** In the seven earths, starting from Ratnaprabha and ending with Mahatamas, the lifespan of the hellish beings is measured as follows: one ocean, three oceans, seven oceans, ten oceans, seventeen oceans, twenty-two oceans, and thirty-three oceans. This is their highest state. ||116-117||

**118.** The higher states of the previous hells, when combined with a longer duration, become the lower states of the subsequent hells. The lowest state of the first hell is ten thousand years. ||118||

**119.** Those who are afflicted by anger, pride, delusion, and greed, and whose minds are constantly agitated by the great whirlpool of sorrow and contemplation, such beings with wrong views, whether they are animals, humans, gods, or hellish beings, attain the animal realm, which is filled with suffering and immobile beings. ||119-120||

**121.** Those born in the animal realm, whether they have an earth body, water body, fire body, air body, or plant body, experience the suffering of birth again and again. ||121||

**122.** Some are born with two senses, like worms, others with three senses, like lice, others with four senses, like bees, and others with five senses, like birds, fish, and deer. These beings experience suffering for a long time in their animal births. ||122-123||

**124.** The lowest state of the animal beings born on earth is a moment, and the highest state is one hundred million years. The highest state of the animal beings born in the realm of enjoyment is three palyas, and the lowest state is one palya. ||124||

**125.** Those who are naturally simple, naturally gentle, naturally virtuous, and naturally fearful of sin, are...

Page #74:
---------------------------
## Chapter 36 of the Harivamsha Purana

**36**

Those who are afraid of sin and naturally abstain from consuming honey, meat, and other harmful foods, attain the state of a noble human being. Those who commit evil deeds attain the state of a base human being. || 126 ||

Through the eradication of sin, some of the animals and hell-beings attain the state of a noble human being, and the gods attain it through good deeds. || 127 ||

Even in the human realm, which is filled with noble and ignoble families, beings experience suffering due to the non-attainment of desired objects and separation from loved ones. || 128 ||

Even those who have attained their desired objects and are united with their loved ones, do not experience happiness, as their desires, fueled by worldly objects, burn like a fire. || 129 ||

The birth of a human being serves as a cause for liberation for some, who are near to becoming liberated beings and who serve those who have attained right faith. || 130 ||

The same birth serves as a cause for a long cycle of existence for others, who are far from becoming liberated beings and who are deluded in their minds. || 131 ||

In all realms of action and enjoyment, the state of a human being, like that of animals, is both superior and inferior. || 132 ||

Those who consume only water, air, or the roots, leaves, and fruits of trees, who have a tranquil mind, who have practiced the restraint of passions and senses, who are ascetics, who engage in austerities, who are devoted to bodily penance, who are free from desires, and who are free from the burning of passions, are bound animals, residents of the celestial realms, intermediate beings, celestial beings, and short-lived celestial beings who dwell in the kalpa. All of these are stained by false faith. || 133-135 ||

Among these, the gods named Kandarpa are constantly consumed by lust. The gods of the noble caste are unfit to sit in assemblies, and the gods who are sinners constantly experience distress. || 136 ||

Seeing the great wealth and prosperity of the gods who possess great wealth, these gods, who are distressed by their own unfortunate fate, experience mental suffering. || 137 ||

Due to the rarity of right faith, even those who are destined for liberation sink into the ocean of worldly suffering, like those who are not destined for liberation. || 138 ||

The celestial realm of the residents of the celestial realms is a vast ocean, their highest state. The celestial realm of the intermediate beings is a single palya, and their lowest state is ten thousand years. || 139 ||

The celestial realm of the celestial beings is a vast ocean, their highest state, and their lowest state is one-eighth of a palya. The celestial realm of the gods is a vast ocean, their highest state, and their lowest state is a single palya. || 140 ||

## Third Chapter

**37**

Five attainments are obtained by some who are free from distractions: destruction, pacification, purification, qualification, and preaching. ||14||

There are three types of actions: downward-moving, unprecedented, and non-ceasing. ||142||

Then, by pacifying the delusion of perception, one attains pacification of destruction, destruction, and self-purification. ||143||

First, one becomes pacifying, then pacifying of destruction, and then destructive, thus generating right faith and experiencing it. ||144||

Similarly, by attaining the pacification of destruction of the delusion of conduct, one attains conduct and destroys karma. ||145||

Then, they dwell in liberation, with infinite bliss, infinite knowledge, infinite perception, and infinite power. ||146||

Those who are very strong in the delusion of conduct, but do not attain conduct, become bound to the lifespan of a deva due to their unwavering right faith. ||147||

Those who are restrained and unrestrained, are devas in the kalpas from Saudharma to Acyuta, possessing great wealth. ||148||

Those who are superior in passionate restraint and those who are unrestrained and free from faults, some become devas in the kalpa, and others become devas beyond the kalpa. ||149||

Those who reside in the nine Graiveyak, nine Anudish, and five Anuttara vimanas are known as devas beyond the kalpa. ||150||

The devas born in the kalpa are of many types, like Indra and others, while the devas beyond the kalpa are only called Ahamindra, without any distinction. All of them enjoy the fruits of their austerities in the heavenly realm, having walked the righteous path. ||151||

The lifespan of devas in Saudharma and Aishana is slightly more than two oceans, in Sanatkumara and Mahendra it is slightly more than seven oceans, in Brahma and Brahmottara it is slightly more than ten oceans, and in Lantava it is slightly more than fourteen oceans. ||152||

Those with a lifespan of ten oceans are called Brahma-Brahmottara devas. ||153||

The lifespan of the highest-ranking devas in heaven is thirty-three oceans, while the lifespan of the lowest-ranking devas is slightly more than one palya. The lifespan of the lowest-ranking devas in hell is one-eighth of a palya. ||140||

When a worthy being attains the five attainments of destruction, pacification, purification, qualification, and preaching, as well as the three types of actions: downward-moving, unprecedented, and non-ceasing, then, according to their self-purification, they destroy the delusion of perception karma through pacification, pacification of destruction, or destruction, first becoming pacifying, then pacifying of destruction, and then destructive, thus generating right faith and experiencing it. ||141-144||

After attaining right faith, many worthy beings attain conduct by pacifying the delusion of conduct, destroy karma, and then attain liberation, dwelling in infinite bliss, infinite knowledge, infinite perception, and infinite power. ||145-146||

Those worthy beings who are very strong in the delusion of conduct, but do not attain conduct, become bound to the lifespan of a deva due to their unwavering right faith. ||147||

Similarly, those humans who are restrained and unrestrained, meaning those who possess the conduct of the land, are devas in the kalpas from Saudharma to Acyuta, possessing great wealth. ||148||

Those humans who are superior in passionate restraint and those who are unrestrained and free from faults, some become devas in the kalpa, and others become devas beyond the kalpa. ||149||

Those who reside in the nine Graiveyak, nine Anudish, and five Anuttara vimanas are known as devas beyond the kalpa. ||150||

The devas born in the kalpa are of many types, like Indra and others, while the devas beyond the kalpa are only called Ahamindra, without any distinction. All of them enjoy the fruits of their austerities in the heavenly realm, having walked the righteous path. ||151||

The lifespan of devas in Saudharma and Aishana is slightly more than two oceans, in Sanatkumara and Mahendra it is slightly more than seven oceans, in Brahma and Brahmottara it is slightly more than ten oceans, and in Lantava it is slightly more than fourteen oceans. ||152||

Those with a lifespan of ten oceans are called Brahma-Brahmottara devas. ||153||

The lifespan of the highest-ranking devas in heaven is thirty-three oceans, while the lifespan of the lowest-ranking devas is slightly more than one palya. The lifespan of the lowest-ranking devas in hell is one-eighth of a palya. ||140||

Page #76:
---------------------------
Harivamsha Purana

The lifespan of the devas in the Shukra and Mahashukra kalpas is sixteen thousand years. In the Shatara and Sahasrara kalpas, the lifespan is eighteen thousand years. \\15\\

The devas in the Anata and Pranata realms have a lifespan of twenty thousand years. The devas in the Arana and Achyuta realms live for twenty-two thousand years. \\155\\

The lifespan increases by one ocean (sagar) in each successive Graiveyaka realm, starting from twenty-two oceans in the first Graiveyaka and reaching thirty-one oceans in the ninth Graiveyaka. The highest state is more excellent, while the lower state is less excellent. \\156\\

In the nine Anudiśas, the highest state is thirty-two oceans, and the lowest state is thirty-one oceans. \\157\\

In the five Anuttara vimanas, the highest state is thirty-three oceans, and the lowest state (except for Sarvārtha-siddhi) is thirty-two oceans. In Sarvārtha-siddhi, there is no lowest state, as all the inhabitants have the same state of existence. \\158\\

The highest state of the devis in the Saudharma realm is five Palyopamas. In the realms up to Sahasrara, the lifespan increases by two oceans in each successive realm. Then, it increases by seven oceans in each successive realm. Thus, in the sixteenth realm, the lifespan is fifty-five Palyopamas. Beyond that, there are no female deities. \\159-160\\

The creation of all the female deities residing in the kalpas is always in the first and second realms, by the power of their karmas. \\161\\

The devas of the Jyotishi, Bhavanavasi, Vyantara, Saudharma, and Aisana realms engage in sexual intercourse due to the intense arising of delusion (moha). \\162\\

The devas of the Sānatkumāra and Māhendra realms engage in tactile contact due to the moderate arising of delusion, as their sexual desire is pacified by mere touch. \\163\\

The devas of the Brahma, Brahmottara, Lāntava, and Kāpiṣṭha realms engage in visual contact, as their desire is satisfied by merely seeing the forms of the female deities. \\164\\

The devas of the Śukra, Mahāśukra, Śatāra, and Sahasrāra realms engage in auditory contact, as their desire is satisfied by merely hearing the sounds of the female deities. \\165\\

The devas of the Anata, Pranata, Āraṇa, and Achyuta realms engage in mental contact, as their desire is pacified by merely contemplating the female deities in their minds, due to the very mild arising of delusion. \\166\\

Beyond that, the devas up to Sarvārtha-siddhi are free from any kind of contact, as they are established in the state of equanimity (śama) and bliss (śarmā), due to the indistinct arising of delusion. \\167\\

## The Third Chapter

As they are, so are their influence, happiness, and brilliance. They are also superior in terms of purity, senses, and the objects of knowledge. [168]

From the Sōdharma heaven upwards, the gods are increasingly superior in terms of their position, brilliance, influence, happiness, purity of the Leshyas, and the objects of their senses and knowledge. They are also increasingly inferior in terms of their speed, height of their bodies, pride, and attachments. [169]

The great, invaluable jewel of liberation is easily attainable through their influence. Having enjoyed the happiness of the gods, where all desires are fulfilled by mere thought, they fall from heaven and are born as the best of men, or Narayanas, in the realms of the Videhas, Bharatas, and Airavatas. [170-171]

Some are the lords of six continents, possessing nine treasures and fourteen jewels. Their final actions are capable of attaining the happiness of liberation. [172]

Some others live for two or three births and then attain liberation. Some are Balabhadra, and they go to heaven or liberation. Others are those who bind the karmic roots in their previous births, and they are Narayanas and Antinarayanas. [173]

Some others, having practiced the sixteen auspicious causes in their previous births, become the holders of fame, the Tirthankaras, and they rule over the three worlds. [174]

Those who have the firm root of Right Faith, who are established in the knowledge-body, who hold the body of conduct, who are adorned with the branches and sub-branches of the right path, and who serve the tree of the Jina's teachings, which bears the flowers of prosperity for humans and gods, will attain the great fruit of liberation in the future. [175-176]

Having attained the essence, the subtle taste of the supreme bliss, which is the form of liberation, the Siddhas, having attained liberation, remain in the realm of the Siddhas. [177]

Hearing this Dharma-teaching, the lotus of the three worlds, the embodiment of the three worlds, was filled with joy and shone brightly, having come into contact with the sun of the path of liberation. [178]

Those who were already filled with a noble love for Dharma, having heard the Dharma-teaching, were purified by the fire of the world's stories and shone with the brilliance of a collection of pure jewels. [179]

Just as a cloud of rain calms the remaining dust, so the Jain teachings, the support of the three worlds, calm the remaining dust of delusion. [180]

In the Harivansha Purana, after the divine sound of the Jain, the gods then investigated it. They made sounds like a Dundubhi, showered flowers and ropes, and praised the great Muni in the forest. Hearing of the great Muni being worshipped by the gods, Shrenik, filled with wonder, bowed to Gautama and asked, "O Bhagavan! O Pujya! Please tell me, what is the name of this Muni who is being worshipped by the gods? What is his lineage? And what wonder has he attained today?" 
Then, Gautama Swami, who had lost his ego and who knew the knowable through the Agamas and inference, said to Shrenik, who was filled with wonder, "O Maharaj Shrenik! Listen, I will tell you the name, lineage, and greatness of this noble Muni. O King of the Earth! You must have heard of the famous king Jitashatru on this earth. He was the sun of the Harivansha sky, who surpassed the position of other kings, who renounced the wealth of the kingdom and took initiation near the Jina, and who performed difficult external and internal austerities for others. Today, he has attained the wonderful knowledge of Kevala by destroying his Ghatya karmas." 
Therefore, all the gods who promote the path of the Jina, worshipped this Muni with devotion for the attainment of the three jewels. 
Then, Shrenik, who was filled with curiosity, bowed again with devotion and asked the Ganadhara, "O Bhagavan! Who is this Harivansha? When and where was he born? And who is the original cause of this man?" 
"How many kings have there been in the Harivansha, who were capable of protecting the people and who were endowed with Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha?" 
This is said: 1. He who has lost his pride. 2. He who is knowable, knowable, and knowable by the Agamas and inference. 3. After the destruction of Ghatya karmas. 4. Those who have come and gone.

## The Third Canto

**41. I wish to hear the complete history of all the lineages, their origins, and the division of the worlds. You are capable of telling me this.** (195)

**The king said, "O Gautama, you have asked a fitting question. Listen carefully, I will tell you everything in detail."** (196)

**"O noble Shrenik, I will first describe the stable form of the three worlds, the foundation for experiencing happiness and suffering. Then I will speak of the various lineages and their incarnations. After that, I will tell you about the origin of the captivating Hari-Vamsa, and finally, I will recount the kings born in the Hari-Vamsa for your eager ears."** (197)

**"Through the teachings of the omniscient, the noble beings, even those who are far removed from the true nature of things, are able to determine the true nature of things in accordance with the laws of time, space, and nature. The delusion of those who have right vision only has power over them in this world, as long as the sun of the Jina, radiant with the rays of knowledge, has not risen."** (198)

**Thus ends the third canto of the Hari-Vamsa, composed by the venerable Jinasena, titled "The Description of Shrenik's Question," which is a collection of the Arishta-Nemika Purana.** (3)

**King Shrenik asked again, "I wish to hear the complete history of the Tirthankaras, Chakravartis, Bala-Bhadras, Narayanas, and Pratinarayanas born in this Bharat Kshetra, the origin of their lineages, and the division of the worlds. You are capable of telling me this."** (194-195)

**Hearing this, Gautama Swami said, "O King, you have asked a fitting question. Listen carefully, I will tell you everything in detail."** (196)

**"O noble Shrenik, I will first describe the stable form of the three worlds, the foundation for experiencing happiness and suffering. Then I will speak of the various lineages and their incarnations. After that, I will tell you about the origin of the captivating Hari-Vamsa, and finally, I will recount the kings born in the Hari-Vamsa for your eager ears."** (197)

**"The noble beings, through the teachings of the omniscient, are able to determine the true nature of things, even those who are far removed from the true nature of things, in accordance with the laws of time, space, and nature. The delusion of those who have right vision only has power over them in this world, as long as the sun of the Jina, radiant with the rays of knowledge, has not risen."** (198)

**Thus ends the third canto of the Hari-Vamsa, composed by the venerable Jinasena, titled "The Description of Shrenik's Question," which is a collection of the Arishta-Nemika Purana.** (3)

## Fourth Chapter

The **Alokaakasha** is considered to be infinite in its expanse, infinite in its own regions, and devoid of any other substances.  ||1||

Since no living beings or their souls are perceived within it, it is known as **Alokaakasha**. ||2||

Neither motion nor rest exists for the **Jiva** and **Pudgala** within it, as the causes, **Dharmaastikaya** and **Adharmaastikaya**, are absent. ||3||

Within this **Alokaakasha**, the **Loka** (universe) is situated, eternal and without beginning or end, with countless regions and blended with the **Alokaakasha**. ||4||

The **Kala** (time), **Dravya** (substance), and all the other five **Panchaastikaya** with their respective expansions are perceived within it, hence it is called **Loka**. ||5||

This **Loka** resembles a **Vetrasana** (bamboo seat), a **Mridanga** (drum), and a large **Jhallari** (cymbal) in its form. The **Adholoka** (lower world) is like the base of the **Vetrasana**, the **Urdhvaloka** (upper world) is like the **Mridanga**, and the **Madhyaloka** (middle world), also known as **Tiryak Loka**, is like the **Jhallari**. ||6||

If half a **Mridanga** is placed below and a full **Mridanga** is placed on top, the resulting shape is similar to the shape of the **Loka**, except that it is square. ||7||

Alternatively, the **Loka** resembles the form of a man standing still with his hands on his hips and legs spread out. ||8||

The **Adholoka** extends downwards for seven **Rajju** (units of measurement) in its expanse. As we move upwards, the regions decrease, leaving only one **Rajju** in the **Madhyaloka**. ||9||

Above the **Madhyaloka**, the regions increase, reaching five **Rajju** near the **Brahmabrahma** heaven. Further upwards, the regions decrease again, leaving only one **Rajju** at the end of the **Loka**. ||10||

The total length of the three **Lokas** is fourteen **Rajju**. Seven **Rajju** are below the **Mandara** mountain, and seven **Rajju** are above it. ||11||

The first **Rajju** extends from the lower part of the **Chitra** earth to the end of the second earth. The second **Rajju** extends from the end of the second earth to the end of the third earth, and so on. ||12||

The fourth **Rajju** ends at the end of the fifth earth, the fifth **Rajju** ends at the end of the sixth earth, and the sixth **Rajju** ends at the end of the seventh earth. The seventh **Rajju** is situated at the end of the **Loka**. ||13||

## Fourth Chapter

**43**

From below Citrā, one and a half *rajju* are completed. From there, up to Aiśāna, one and a half *rajju* are situated. Then, up to Mahendra, one *rajju* is situated. Then, up to Kāpiṣṭa, one *rajju* is situated. Then, up to Sahasrāra, one *rajju* is situated. Then, up to Āraṇa Acyuta, one *rajju* is situated. Then, up to the end of the upper world, one *rajju* is situated. Thus, a total of seven *rajju* are completed.

The extent of the lower world is described by the knowers of the world as follows:

At the end of the first *rajju*, where the second earth ends, the extent of the lower world is one *rajju* and six parts out of seven of a *rajju*.

At the end of the second *rajju*, where the third earth ends, the extent of the lower world is two complete *rajju* and five parts out of seven of a *rajju*.

At the end of the third *rajju*, where the fourth earth ends, the extent of the lower world is three *rajju* and four parts out of seven of a *rajju*.

At the end of the fourth *rajju*, where the fifth earth ends, the extent of the lower world is four *rajju* and three parts out of seven of a *rajju*.

At the end of the fifth *rajju*, where the sixth earth ends, the extent of the lower world is five *rajju* and two parts out of seven of a *rajju*.

At the end of the sixth *rajju*, where the seventh earth ends, the extent of the lower world is six *rajju* and one part out of seven of a *rajju*.

At the end of the seventh *rajju*, where the world ends, the extent of the lower world is seven *rajju*.

At the height of one and a half *rajju* above Citrā, where the second Aiśāna heaven ends, the extent of the world is two complete *rajju* and five parts out of seven of a *rajju*.

At the height of one and a half *rajju* above that, where Mahendra heaven ends, the extent of the world is four *rajju* and three parts out of seven of a *rajju*.

At the height of half a *rajju* above that, where Brahma-uttar heaven ends, the extent of the world is five *rajju*.

At the height of half a *rajju* above that, where Kāpiṣṭa heaven ends, the extent of the world is four *rajju* and three parts out of seven of a *rajju*.

Page #82:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, it is stated that the extent of the universe at the end of the Maha-Shukra heaven is three rajjus (reeds) and six parts out of seven of a rajju. ||25||  Above this, at the end of the Ardha-Rajju and where the Sahasrar heaven ends, the extent of the universe is three rajjus and two parts out of seven of a rajju. ||26||  Further up, at the end of the Pranat heaven, the extent of the universe is two rajjus and five parts out of seven of a rajju. ||27||  Above this, at the end of the Achyut heaven, the extent of the universe is two rajjus and one part out of seven of a rajju. And beyond this, at the end of the seventh rajju, where the boundary of the universe ends, the extent of the universe is one rajju. ||28||  In the three worlds, the Adho-lok is like the thigh and hip of a man, the Tiryanch-lok is like the waist, the end of the Mahendra heaven is like the navel, the Brahma-Brahmottar heaven is like the chest, the thirteenth and fourteenth heavens are like the arms, the Aran-Achyut heaven is like the shoulders, the nine Graiveyak heavens are like the neck, the Anudish is like the raised chin, the Panchanuttar Vimana is like the face, the Siddha Kshetra is like the forehead, and the sky region where the Siddha Jivas reside is like the head. ||29-31||  This universe-like man, within whom all beings and objects reside, is Apourusheya, meaning it is not created by any being. ||32||  The Ghano-dadhi, Ghana-vat, and Tanu-vat, these three wind circles surround this universe from all sides. ||33||  The first, Ghano-dadhi wind circle is like the color of cow urine, the middle one, Ghana-vat, is like the color of a mung bean, and the last one, Tanu-vat, is of many colors mixed together. ||34||  These wind circles are long, like a rod, dense, situated above, below, and all around, they are of a flickering nature, and they surround the universe until its end. ||35||  Below the Adho-lok, the extent of each of the three circles is twenty thousand yojanas, and above the universe, the extent of the three wind circles is one yojana less. ||36||  Below the Adho-lok, the three wind circles are rod-shaped, and as they move upwards and leave the rod-shape, meaning they stand around the universe, they become seven, five, and four yojanas in extent respectively. ||37||  After this, as the area decreases, the extent of these circles in the middle world becomes five, four, and three yojanas respectively. ||38||

Page #83:
---------------------------
## Fourth Chapter

**45**

Seven, five and four yojanas are added in succession, from the region of increase, to the end of the Brahma-Brahmottara heaven. ||39||

Again, from the region of decrease, five, four and three yojanas are added in succession, to the end of the Shiva heaven. ||40||

The Ghonodadhi vatavala is half a yojana (two kosas) in width, the Ghanavatavala is half of that (one kosa), and the Tanuvatavala is slightly less than that (fifteen to seventy-five dhanushas). ||41||

This world, surrounded by the three vatavalas, appears as if it were covered with armor, desiring to conquer the Mahāloka. ||42||

In this world, there are seven lands: the first is Ratnaprabha, the second is Sharkaraprabha, the third is Balukaprabha, the fourth is Pankaprabha, the fifth is Dhumaprabha, the sixth is Tamahprabaha, and the seventh is MahaTamahprabaha. These seven lands are situated on the three vatavalas, and are arranged one below the other. Finally, all of them are situated on the Ghonodadhi vatavala, which is below the Adholoka. ||43-45||

The traditional names of these lands are, in order, Gharbha, Vansha, Megha, Anjana, Aristha, Maghavi, and Madhavi. ||46||

The first land, Ratnaprabaha, is one lakh eighty thousand yojanas thick, and is divided into three parts: the Kharabhaga, the Pankabhaga, and the Abbahulabhaga. ||47||

The first Kharabhaga is sixteen thousand yojanas thick, the second Pankabhaga is eighty-four thousand yojanas thick, and the third Abbahulabhaga is eighty thousand yojanas thick. ||48-49||

The Pankabhaga is adorned with the jeweled, luminous mansions of the Rakshasas and Asura-kumāras, in order. ||50||

And the Kharabhaga is adorned with the mansions of the nine Bhavanavasis, which are luminous, self-illuminating, and of various kinds. ||51||

The Kharabhaga has sixteen layers: 1. Chitra, 2. Vajra, 3. Vaidurya, 4. Lohitanga, 5. Masaragalva, 6. Gomada, 7. Pravala, 8. Jyoti, 9. Rasa, 10. Anjana, 11. Anjanamula, 12. Anga, 13. Sphatika, 14. Chandraabha, 15. Varchaka, and 16. Bahushilāmaya. ||52-54||

Each of these layers is one thousand yojanas thick, and the luminous Kharabhaga is made up of these sixteen layers. ||55||

---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, the six remaining lands, after the land of mud, are described as having their own distinct characteristics, with their thickness being less than the thickness of the single rope that separates them.  

The thickness of the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth lands, as described by the omniscient Jina, are thirty-two thousand, twenty-eight thousand, twenty-four thousand, twenty thousand, sixteen thousand, and eight thousand yojanas respectively.

The number of dwellings of the Asura Kumaras and other ten types of celestial beings residing in the first land should be understood as follows: sixty-four lakhs for the Asura Kumaras, eighty-four lakhs for the Naga Kumaras, seventy-two lakhs for the Garuda Kumaras, seventy-two lakhs for the six Kumaras (Dwipa Kumaras, Uddhika Kumaras, Medha Kumaras, Dik Kumaras, Agni Kumaras, and Vidyut Kumaras), and sixty-nine lakhs for the Vayu Kumaras. These dwellings are arranged in a series, and each has a single Chaityaalaya (temple).

Below the earth, there are fourteen thousand dwellings of the Bhutas and sixteen thousand dwellings of the Rakshasas, arranged in order.

In the Patalaloka, where the sun, in the form of a jewel, constantly emits its radiance, the ten types of celestial beings residing in dwellings, namely the Asura Kumaras, Naga Kumaras, Suparna Kumaras, Dwipa Kumaras, Uddhika Kumaras, Stanita Kumaras, Vidyut Kumaras, Dik Kumaras, Agni Kumaras, and Vayu Kumaras, reside in their respective dwellings as per their nature.

The lifespan of the Asura Kumaras is slightly longer than one Sagar, the Naga Kumaras have a lifespan of three Palyas, the Suparna Kumaras have a lifespan of two and a half Palyas, the Dwipa Kumaras have a lifespan of two Palyas, and the remaining six Kumaras have a lifespan of one and a half Palyas.

The height of the Asura Kumaras is twenty-five Dhanus, the height of the remaining nine types of dwelling-dwellers and the Vyantaras is ten Dhanus, and the height of the Jyotishis (astronomers) is seven Dhanus.

The height of the Devas in the Saudharma and Aishana heavens is seven Hastas. From there, the height decreases by half a Hasta, and in the Sarvarthasiddhi heaven, the height is one Hasta. This means that the height in the first and second heavens is seven Hastas, in the third and fourth heavens is six Hastas, in the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth heavens is five Hastas, in the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth heavens is four Hastas, in the thirteenth and fourteenth heavens is three and a half Hastas, in the fifteenth and sixteenth heavens is three Hastas, in the Adhogreveyakas is two and a half Hastas, in the Madhyama Aveyakas is two Hastas, in the Upari Aveyakas and Anudish Vimanas is one and a half Hastas, and in the Anuttar Vimanas is one Hasta.

Gautama Swami says, "O Shrenik! Now, I will briefly describe the characteristics of the seven lands, starting with the Ratnaprabha, in order. Listen!"

Page #104:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, it is stated that the height of the Narakas (hells) in the single A-prati-sthana (non-established) realm is five hundred Dhanush (bows) as determined by the Acharyas (teachers) with certain knowledge.

The subject of Avadhi-jnana (knowledge of the realms) in the seven Prithvis (earths) should be understood in this order:

* In the first Prithvi, the subject of Avadhi-jnana is one Yojana (four Krosa).
* In the second Prithvi, it is three and a half Krosa.
* In the third Prithvi, it is three Krosa.
* In the fourth Prithvi, it is two and a half Krosa.
* In the fifth Prithvi, it is two Krosa.
* In the sixth Prithvi, it is one and a half Krosa.
* In the seventh Prithvi, it is one Krosa.

The smell of the earth in the first layer of the first Prithvi extends up to half a Krosa, and below that, it increases by half a Krosa for each subsequent layer.

The Narakas residing in the first and second Prithvis are associated with Kapota-leshya (pigeon-colored). Those in the upper part of the third Prithvi are associated with Kapota-leshya, while those in the lower part are associated with Nila-leshya (blue-colored).

The Narakas in the fourth Prithvi are associated with Nila-leshya both above and below, while those in the upper part of the fifth Prithvi are associated with Nila-leshya and those in the lower part with Krishna-leshya (black-colored).

The Narakas in the upper part of the sixth Prithvi are associated with Krishna-leshya, those in the lower part with Parama-Krishna-leshya (supreme black-colored), and those in the seventh Prithvi, both above and below, are afflicted with Parama-Krishna-leshya.

The Narakas in the first four Prithvis are tormented by hot touch, those in the fifth Prithvi by both hot and cold touch, and those in the last two Prithvis by only cold touch.

The birthplaces of the Narakas in the first three Prithvis are shaped like camels, Kumbhi (pots), Kusthali (a type of plant), Mudgara (hammer), Mridanga (drum), and Nadi (pipe).

The birthplaces of the Narakas in the fourth and fifth Prithvis are shaped like cows, elephants, horses, and other animals, as well as Dhonkani (bellows), boats, and lotus buds.

The birthplaces of the Narakas in the last two Prithvis are shaped like fields, Jhallari (a type of ornament), and Katori (bowls), as well as Mayura (peacocks).

These birthplaces are one Krosa, two Krosa, three Krosa, and one Yojana in extent. The most prominent ones are said to be one hundred Yojana wide.

The height of all these birthplaces is five times their width, as known by the Acharyas who understand the true nature of things.

All Indraka-vil (a type of hell) have three doors and three corners. Apart from these, there are many other Nigoda (hells) that are categorized and scattered, some of which have two doors.

## Fourth Chapter

There are countless three-doored triangles, five-doored pentagons, and seven-doored heptagons. ||352||

The **nigoda** with a measurable **yojana** expanse have a minimum interval of six **kosas** and a maximum interval of twelve **kosas**. ||353||

The **nigoda** with an immeasurable **yojana** expanse have an immeasurable **yojana** as their maximum interval and seven thousand **yojanas** as their minimum interval. ||354||

The **naraki** beings born in the **nigoda** of the first earth, **Dharma**, jump up seven **yojanas** and three and a quarter **kosas** into the sky before falling back down. ||355||

The **naraki** beings born in the **nigoda** of the second earth, **Vansha**, jump up fifteen **yojanas** and two and a half **kosas** into the sky before falling back down. ||356||

The beings born in the **nigoda** of the third earth, **Megha**, jump up thirty-one **yojanas** and one **kosa** into the sky before falling back down. ||357||

The **naraki** beings born in the **nigoda** of the fourth earth, **Anjana**, jump up sixty-two **yojanas** and two **kosas** into the sky before falling back down, experiencing intense suffering. ||358||

The **naraki** beings born in the **nigoda** of the fifth earth jump up one hundred and twenty-five **yojanas** into the sky before falling back down, experiencing great suffering. ||359||

The beings born in the **nigoda** of the sixth earth jump up two hundred **yojanas** into the sky before falling back down. ||360||

The beings born in the **nigoda** of the seventh earth jump up five hundred **dhanus** high before falling back down to the earth. ||361||

The **Asura** children fight the **naraki** beings up to the third earth. They also fight amongst themselves, remembering their ancient animosity. ||362||

The **naraki** beings are torn apart by spears, clubs, and tridents, all born from their own bodies, and they inflict pain upon each other. ||363||

Even when torn apart, their bodies recombine like mercury, and they do not die until their lifespan is over. ||364||

These **naraki** beings constantly suffer, both physically and mentally, due to the consequences of their past karma. ||365||

## English Translation:

In the Harivansh Purana, it is said that those who suffer from intense physical and mental pain, drink the water of the extremely hot and salty Vaitarani river and eat food made of foul-smelling clay, thus enduring unbearable suffering. ||365|| Those who are being roasted in hell, day and night, do not experience even a moment of happiness, not even the blinking of an eye. ||366|| They have extremely inauspicious consequences, becoming eunuchs and having a deformed body. ||368|| Those who are destined to become Tirthankaras in the future, and whose karmas have subsided, are freed from their afflictions by the gods out of devotion, six months before their birth. ||369|| The learned Acharyas have stated that the interval between the birth of hell beings in the first earth is forty-eight ghatikas. ||370|| And in the six lower realms, the interval of separation is, respectively, one week, one fortnight, one month, two months, four months, and six months. ||371|| Those who are deeply attached to falsehood and have many beginnings and attachments, are born as animals and humans in those earths. ||372|| The beings with five senses, who are without consciousness, go to the first earth, the crawling ones to the second, the birds to the third, the snakes to the fourth, the lions to the fifth, the women to the sixth, and the extremely sinful fish and humans to the seventh earth. ||373-374|| A being who has emerged from the seventh earth, if he goes back to the seventh earth immediately, will be born once, a being who has emerged from the sixth earth will be born twice in the sixth earth, a being who has emerged from the fifth earth will be born thrice in the fifth earth, a being who has emerged from the fourth earth will be born four times in the fourth earth, a being who has emerged from the third earth will be born five times in the third earth, a being who has emerged from the second earth will be born six times in the second earth, and a being who has emerged from the first earth will be born seven times in the first earth. ||375-377|| A being who has emerged from the seventh earth, becomes a conscious animal by rule, and having the income of a counted number of years, goes back to hell. ||378|| A being who has emerged from the sixth earth does not attain self-control. And a being who has emerged from the fifth earth can attain self-control, but not liberation. ||379|| A being who has emerged from the fourth earth can attain liberation, but he will definitely not become a Tirthankara. ||380|| A being who has emerged from the third, second, and first earth,

## Fourth Chapter

One who has attained purity of **darshan** (right faith) can become a **Tirthankara**. ||381||

Beings who have emerged from the hells, having abandoned the **Balakeshava Chakra** (the cycle of Balabhadra, Narayana, and Chakravarti), can only attain the human state. They cannot become Balabhadra, Narayana, or Chakravarti. ||382||

Gautama Swami says, "O Shrenik! I have thus described the divisions of the lower realms in brief. Now listen to the description of the divisions of the **tiryagloka** (animal realm) and the **madhyamaloka** (intermediate realm)." ||383||

Wise beings, with the power of the excellent lamps of the words of the Jina, which are omnipresent and always present, destroy the darkness of the lower realms, which are beyond the reach of the sun and moon, and see the true nature of things. What is surprising in this? For where can darkness exist when light is generated by the sun of the Jina in the three realms? ||384||

Thus ends the fourth chapter of the **Harivaṃśa Purāṇa**, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which contains a collection of the **Ariṣṭanemi Purāṇa**, and describes the structure of the lower realms. ||4||

## Fifth Canto

The Tiryanch Lok, extending from Tanuvat to the end, is established. Its extent is marked by the Meru, which is one lakh yojanas in size.  ||1||

Within this, surrounded by countless oceans and islands, lies the Jambudvipa, circular and marked by the Jambū tree. ||2||

It extends to the ocean, encircled by a vajra-like platform, and has the great Meru as its center, which is one lakh yojanas in size. ||3||

Its circumference is three lakh sixteen thousand two hundred twenty-seven yojanas, one hundred twenty-eight koshas, one hundred twenty-eight bows, and thirteen and a half angulas. ||4-5||

When divided, mathematicians say that the cubic area of this Jambudvipa is seven hundred ninety crore fifty-six lakh ninety-nine thousand one hundred fifty yojanas. ||6-7||

In this Jambudvipa, there are seven regions, one Meru, two Kurus, two trees named Jambū and Shalmali, six Kulachala mountains, six Mahasarovar lakes situated on the Kulachala mountains, fourteen great rivers, twelve Vibhang rivers, twenty Vaksara mountains, thirty-four capitals, thirty-four Rupayachala mountains, thirty-four Vrishabhachala mountains, sixty-eight caves, four circular navel mountains, and three thousand seven hundred forty cities of the Vidyadhara kings. ||8-11||

With all these things, this Jambudvipa shines brightly. Twice the size of this Jambudvipa, and with a Meru and other features, the Dhataki-khanda island shines brightly, and the Pushkaradham is also similar to the Dhataki-khanda, with all regions, mountains, and other features. ||12-13||

In this, the southern region is Bharat, and the northern region is Himavat. The Harikshetra, Videha, and Ramyak are also located there. ||13||

Page #109:
---------------------------
## Chapter 5: The Seven Regions of Jambudvipa

**71**

The fifth region is called **Hairanyavata**, followed by **Airavata**. The extent of each region, starting from **Bharata** and ending with **Videha**, is four times that of the preceding one. 

**11**

The first mountain range is called **Himavan**, followed by **Mahahimavan**, **Nishada**, **Nila**, **Rukmi**, and **Shikhari**.

**15**

Each subsequent mountain range is four times the extent of the preceding one, starting from **Himavan**. This pattern continues until **Nishada**. The three mountain ranges north of **Nishada** are said to be equal in extent to the southern ones.

**16**

The extent of the first region, **Bharata**, is 526 1/6 yojanas.

**17**

The diameter of **Jambudvipa** is 100,000 yojanas. If you divide this by 190, you get the extent of **Bharata**.

**18**

The extent of each mountain range is twice that of the corresponding region, and the extent of each region is twice that of the corresponding mountain range. This pattern continues until **Videha**. Beyond **Videha**, the extent of both regions and mountain ranges decreases by half.

**19**

In the middle of **Bharata** lies another mountain called **Vijaya**, known for its beauty. It extends from the eastern to the western ocean and is inhabited by **Vidyadharas**.

**20**

This mountain is 25 yojanas high, 6 1/4 yojanas below the surface of the earth, and 50 yojanas wide.

**21**

**Note:** The extent of the regions and mountain ranges is as follows:

1. **Bharata** region: 526 1/6 yojanas
2. **Himavan** mountain: 1052 1/3 yojanas
3. **Hairanyavata** region: 2105 1/3 yojanas
4. **Mahahimavan** mountain: 4210 1/2 yojanas
5. **Hari** region: 8421 1/2 yojanas
6. **Nishada** mountain: 16842 1/4 yojanas
7. **Videha** region: 33684 1/4 yojanas
8. **Nila** mountain: 67368 1/2 yojanas
9. **Ramyaka** region: 16842 1/4 yojanas
10. **Rukmi** mountain: 33684 1/2 yojanas
11. **Hairanyavata** region: 8421 1/2 yojanas
12. **Shikhari** mountain: 16842 1/4 yojanas
13. **Airavata** region: 4210 1/2 yojanas

**8-12**

There are seven regions in **Jambudvipa**: **Bharata**, **Himavata**, **Hari**, **Videha**, **Ramyaka**, **Hairanyavata**, and **Airavata**. **Bharata** is the southernmost region, and **Airavata** is the northernmost. The extent of each region, starting from **Bharata** and ending with **Videha**, is four times that of the preceding one.

**13-14**

The extent of **Himavata** is four times that of **Bharata**, the extent of **Hari** is four times that of **Himavata**, and the extent of **Videha** is four times that of **Hari**. The extent of the regions beyond **Videha** is one-fourth that of the preceding one. This means the extent of **Ramyaka** is one-fourth that of **Videha**, the extent of **Hairanyavata** is one-fourth that of **Ramyaka**, and the extent of **Airavata** is one-fourth that of **Hairanyavata**.

In the Harivamsha Purana, the extent of Videha is stated as thirty-three thousand six hundred and eighty-four yojanas, and four parts of nineteen parts of a yojana. [9] Its pratyamchaka is equal to one hundred thousand yojanas, as per the measurement of Jambudvipa. [12] The extent of its dhanush-prishtha is one lakh eighty-eight thousand one hundred and thirteen yojanas, and sixteen and a half kalas more. [13] The extent of its bana is fifty thousand yojanas, which is appropriate, as a large bow should have a large arrow. [14] The chulika of half of Videha is two thousand nine hundred and twenty-one yojanas, and eighteen kalas more. [15] The extent of both its arms is sixteen thousand eight hundred and eighty-three yojanas, and thirteen and a quarter kalas more. [96] The measurement of the southern half of the dvipa, as described, should be understood to be the same for the northern half, in terms of the extent of the land and mountains. [17] The pratyamchaka, dhanush-prishtha, bana, arms, and chulika, whose extent is described for the southern half, is the same for the remaining half.

These peaks, resembling the snowy peaks of the Himalayas, are beautiful in their appearance. They are adorned with their length, breadth, and height, and are charming in their splendor. ||10||

Similarly, on the summit of the Vijayardha mountain, situated in the middle of the Airawat region, nine peaks stand tall, adorned with clusters of precious gems and jewels. ||109||

The Siddhayatan peak is known as the Uttaraardha, and the Tamisraguha peak is situated beyond it. ||110||

The Vijayardha Kumara peak and the Purnabhadra peak are also situated beyond it. The Khandakadiprapaata peak and the Dakshinaardha peak are also named. ||111||

The ninth peak is known as the Vaishravana peak. All these peaks are equal in size, according to the standards of the Bharat Kshetra. ||112||

Each of the six Kulachala mountains, which extend from east to west and divide the seven regions, has two forest tracts at both ends. ||113||

These forest tracts are adorned with trees laden with flowers of all seasons and fruits, and are filled with the sweet sounds of deer, birds, and bees. They are half a yojana in extent, adorned with various jewel-studded platforms, and are equal in length to the mountain. ||114-115||

The wise ones, who know the secrets of the universe, have declared that the height of these platforms is half a yojana and their width is five hundred dhanus. ||116||

On the platforms, at suitable places, there are toranas made of various precious gems and jewels, in various colors. ||117||

Above the Kulachala mountains, there is a divine lotus platform, made of gems and jewels, and rising to a height of two kosas. ||118||

In the middle world, the platforms of houses, islands, oceans, earth, rivers, lakes, and mountains should be understood in the same way, i.e., their height is half a yojana and their width is five hundred dhanus. ||119||

In the middle of these six great Kulachala mountains, there are six large lakes, extending from east to west. ||120||

Their names are: Padma, Mahapadma, Tigincha, Kesari, Mahapuṇḍarīka, and Puṇḍarīka. ||121||

In the Harivamsha Purana, the rivers Ganga, Sindhu, Rohya, Rohitasy, Harit, Harikanta, Sita, Sitoda, Nari, Narakanta, Suvarnakula, Rupaykula, Rakta, and Raktoda are described. All these rivers are accompanied by thousands of tributaries on the earth. 

The Padma lake is a thousand yojanas long, five hundred yojanas wide, and ten yojanas deep. This lake is surrounded on all sides by a platform, similar to the platform of the Himalayas, filled with auspicious and cool water. 

There is a lotus in this Padma lake, which is one yojana in extent. This lotus emerges from the water and rises half a yojana above it, and its corolla is adorned with a kosha. 

The other lakes in the south and north have twice the length, width, etc., of the previous lakes, and lotuses adorn all these lakes. 

On the lotuses, there are high buildings, in which the goddesses Shri, Ho, Dhriti, Kirti, Buddhi, and Lakshmi reside in order. 

All these goddesses have a lifespan of one palya. The goddesses in the south are obedient to Saudharmendra, and the goddesses in the north are obedient to Aishanesha. All of them are accompanied by the assembly of the Samanika gods. 

The Ganga river flows out from the eastern gate of the Padma lake, the Sindhu river flows out from the western gate, and the Rohitasy river flows out from the northern gate. These rivers flow out of the lake and flow for some distance on the mountain. 

From the Mahapadma lake, the Rohya and Harikanta rivers flow out, from the Tigich, the Harit and Sitoda rivers flow out, from the Kesari lake, the Sita and Narakanta rivers flow out, from the Mahapuṇḍarīka lake, the Nari and Rupaykula rivers flow out, and from the Puṇḍarīka lake, the Suvarnakula, Rakta, and Raktoda rivers flow out. The gates from which these rivers flow out are adorned with toranas. 

The width of the Vajramukha gate from which the Ganga flows out is six yojanas and one kosha, and its depth is half a kosha. There is a torana made of various precious stones on that gate, which is nine yojanas and one eighth of a yojana in extent.

Having flowed eastward for five hundred yojanas, the Ganga then turned back, flowing southward from the Ganga Kूट and entered the Bharat Kṣetra. [30]  She crossed over the sky, exceeding one hundred yojanas, and fell upon the mountain, twenty-five yojanas away. [13]

The Jivīkā, a system shaped like a bull's head, is six yojanas wide and one yojana deep, half a yojana high, and as long as it is wide. [14]  The Ganga, flowing through this system, took on the shape of a cow's horn and fell in front of Śrī's house, spreading out for ten yojanas on the ground. [11]

There is a Vajrakuṇḍa, sixty yojanas wide, with a mouth shaped like a diamond. In the middle of this pond, there is an island, ten yojanas wide. [14]  On this island, there is a diamond-like, immovable mountain, eight yojanas in diameter and two krośas high. [143]  This mountain is four yojanas wide at the base, two yojanas in the middle, and one yojana at the top, and ten yojanas high. [144]

On the peak of this mountain, at its base, and in the middle, there are two thousand bows wide, and within, five hundred yojanas long, two hundred and fifty yojanas wide, and two thousand yojanas high, a shining diamond house. [145-146]  This house has a diamond door, called Vajrakapatā, eighty yojanas high and forty yojanas wide. [147]

Flowing south from the Vajrakuṇḍa, the Ganga, taking on the shape of an earring, entered the cave of the Vijayardha mountain, becoming eight yojanas wide. [148]  With fourteen thousand rivers, she entered the eastern salt sea, becoming sixty-five and a half yojanas wide. [149]

The Ganga is three parts high. [137]

In the Harivamsha Purana, it is stated that the Torana (gateway) of the salt ocean is ninety-nine yojanas and three kosas high and half a yojana deep. ||150||

The Sindhu river is similar to the Ganga river in all respects, except that it flows into the western salt ocean. From the Ganga and Sindhu to the Videha region, the extent of the tongues and other parts of all the rivers should be known to be double. ||151||

All the Toranas are equal in depth, and in all those Toranas, the Dikkumari goddesses reside as per their respective positions. ||152||

The Rohitasya river flows on the mountain for two hundred and seventy-six yojanas and six kalas. After that, it falls from the mountain and goes towards the abode of Shri Devi. ||153||

The Rohya river flows on the mountain for one thousand six hundred and five yojanas and five kalas, and then falls from it fifty yojanas away. ||154||

Similarly, the Harikanta river also flows on the Mahahimalaya mountain for one thousand six hundred and fifty yojanas and five kalas towards the north, and then falls into a pond fifty yojanas away, and from there goes towards the western ocean. ||155||

The Harit river flows on the Nishdha mountain for seven thousand four hundred and twenty-one yojanas and one kala, and then falls from it one hundred yojanas away. ||156||

The Sitoda river also flows on the mountain for the same distance. After that, it crosses the sky for four hundred yojanas and then falls from the mountain two hundred yojanas away. ||157||

The Sita river also flows on the Neel mountain for the same distance, and then leaps into the sky for the same distance and pierces the eastern Videha region. ||158||

The six rivers in the north are similar to the six rivers in the south, therefore, the description of their waterfalls, etc., should be done appropriately in pairs of two rivers. ||159||

The Ganga, Rohya, Harit, Sita, Nari, Suvarna Kala, and Rakta, these seven rivers flow towards the eastern ocean, and the remaining seven rivers flow towards the western ocean. ||160||

In the middle of the four regions, namely, Haimavat, etc., there are four circular Vijay mountains, namely, Shraddhavan, Vijayavan, Padmavan, and Gandhavan, respectively. ||161||

These mountains are one thousand yojanas wide at the base, seven hundred and fifty yojanas wide in the middle, and five hundred yojanas wide at the top, and they are one thousand yojanas high. ||162||

These mountains are also known as Nabhi Giri. Just as the Sita and Sitoda rivers circumambulate the Meru mountain, similarly, the Rohya, Rohitasya, etc., rivers also circumambulate them. ||163||

## Fifth Canto

The Vyantara gods, namely, Svati, Aruna, Padma, and Prabhasa, reside in the palaces built on the peaks of these mountains. ||164||

The regions, mountains, and rivers described in Jambudvipa are doubled in the Dhatukhanda and Pushkarardha. ||165||

Beyond the numbered islands, there is another Jambudvipa. The cities of the gods mentioned in this Jambudvipa are also present in that other Jambudvipa. ||166||

The regions situated between the Nila Kulachal and Sumeru mountains are considered Uttarakuru, and the regions between Sumeru and Nishadha Kulachal are called Devakuru. ||167||

Both these Kurus are considered to be eleven thousand eight hundred yojanas in extent, with two kalas. ||168||

Their Pratyacha Vayapan is one thousand yojanas, and their Dhanushprista is six thousand four hundred eighteen yojanas, twelve kalas. ||169||

The circumference of these Kuru regions is seventy-one thousand one hundred thirty-four yojanas, four angulas of a yojana, and nine angulas of a yojana. ||170||

The total extent of the Videha region is thirty-three thousand six hundred eighty-four yojanas, four kalas. ||171||

The Jambusthal is said to be located in the northeast (Aishana) direction of Mount Meru, on the eastern bank of the Sita river, near the Nila Kulachal. ||172||

A jeweled platform, five hundred dhanushas wide and two koshas high, surrounds this place on all sides. ||173||

The width of this place is said to be five hundred koshas at the base, eight koshas in the middle, and two koshas at the end. ||174||

On this golden place, there is a platform eight koshas high, which is twelve koshas wide at the base, eight koshas in the middle, and four koshas at the end. ||175||

Below this platform, there are six jeweled platforms on all sides, and on each of these platforms, there are two jeweled platforms. The smaller platforms on these six platforms are called Padmavedikas. ||176||

The Jambudvipa tree adorns the top of this aforementioned platform. The Jambudvipa tree is one kosa wide at the base, its trunk is two yojanas high, its depth is two koshas, and its branches extend eight yojanas...

Page #120:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, it is described that the Jambū tree has a great trunk made of lapis lazuli, adorned with diamond branches, and beautiful silver leaves. It is said to have four main branches, each extending in a cardinal direction. The northern branch is home to a magnificent Jain temple, while the other three branches have palaces where the deities of Ādara and Anādara reside. 

Beneath the Jambū tree, there are numerous palaces, each thirty yojanas wide and fifty yojanas high, built for the deities. The Jambū tree also has a family of trees, each with a main tree at the center, located in the seven intervals between the platforms. 

The first family has four trees, the second has one hundred and eight, the third has four thousand, the fourth has sixteen thousand, the fifth has thirty-two thousand, the sixth has forty thousand, and the seventh has forty-eight thousand. In total, there are one hundred and forty thousand one hundred and nineteen trees, including the seven main trees.

To the southwest of Mount Meru, on the opposite bank of the Sitodā river, near the Niṣadha mountain, lies a silver-colored Śālmalī forest. This forest is similar to the Jambū forest, and the Śālmalī tree within it is described in the same way as the Jambū tree.

The southern branch of the Śālmalī tree is home to an imperishable Jain temple, while the other three branches have palaces where the deities Veṇu and Veṇudārī reside. Just as Ādara and Anādara are revered in the Uttarakuru, Veṇudārī is revered in the Devakuru.

To the south of the Nīla mountain, on the eastern bank of the Sitodā river, there are two peaks called Citra and Vicitra, each a thousand yojanas wide. Similarly, to the north of the Niṣadha mountain, on the banks of the Sitodā river, there are two peaks called Yamakūṭa and Meghakūṭa.

The east-west extent of these (countries) is two thousand two hundred and thirteen yojanas, less one eighth of a yojana.  ||25||

The north-south extent of Videha, excluding the extent of the river, is half the extent of the country. This is the length of the country, the Vaksara mountain, and the Vibhanga river. ||25||

The length of these countries is the same as the width of the Videha. There are nine Kutas in each of these thirty-two Videhas, which are equal in length to the Kutas of the Bharata region. ||255||

There are two rows of these Videhas, each row having fifty-five cities.  In these cities, the Vidyadharas reside, just as they do in the other islands. ||256||

Kshema, Kshemapuri, Rishta, Rishtapuri, Khadga, Manjusha, Aushadhi, and Pundarikinī are the eight capitals of the Kacha, etc., countries respectively.  These are said to be born from the Shalaka Purushas. ||257-258||

They have five hundred small and one thousand large doors, all adorned with jeweled, painted panels, and seven hundred windows. ||263-264||

There are twelve thousand lanes and one thousand squares in these indestructible cities. ||266||

**Explanation:**

* The total east-west extent of all the Videha regions is 33,684 yojanas and 4 kalas.  
* After subtracting the 500 yojanas of the Sota river, the remaining extent is 33,184 yojanas and 4 kalas.
* Half of this remaining extent, 16,592 yojanas and 2 kalas, is the length of the Kacha, etc., countries, the Vaksara mountain, and the Vibhanga river. ||254||

* There are thirty-two Vijayadha mountains in these thirty-two Videhas.  Their length is equal to the width of the Kacha, etc., countries, meaning they extend from the Kulachal to the river.  Each Vijayadha mountain has nine Kutas, and their description is similar to the Vijayadha mountain of the Bharata region. ||255||

Harivamsha Purana
The circumference of the mountain is said to be ten thousand three hundred and ninety yojanas, and three parts out of eleven parts of a yojana. || 299 || Going up thirty-six thousand yojanas from there, the fourth Panduka forest is on the top of the mountain, and the mountain is four hundred and ninety yojanas wide there. || 300 || The circumference of the mountain is three thousand one hundred and two yojanas, plus a little more than one kosha. || 301 || There is a Vaidurya gem-studded pinnacle on the top of Mount Meru, forty yojanas high. This pinnacle is twelve yojanas wide at the base, eight yojanas in the middle, and four yojanas at the end. || 302 || The circumference of the pinnacle is thirty-seven yojanas at the base, twenty-five yojanas in the middle, and twelve yojanas plus a little more at the front. || 303 || From the pinnacle of Mount Meru downwards, there are six earth-bodies, namely: 1. Lohitakshamaya, 2. Padmaragmaya, 3. Vajramaya, 4. Sarvaratnamaya, 5. Vaiduryamya, and 6. Haritalamya. Each of these circumferences is sixteen thousand five hundred yojanas wide. Besides these, there is also a seventh circumference made by the forests. And below that, there are eleven parts, which are to be known by the examiners, as follows: 1. Bhadrashala forest, 2. Manushoत्तर, 3. Devaraman, 4. Nagaraman, 5. Bhutaraman, 6. Nandan, 7. Upanandan, 8. Saumanas, 9. Upasaumanas, 10. Panduka, and 11. Upapanduka. Of these, the Bhadrashala forest, which is on the earth, contains five forests: Bhadrashala, Manushoत्तर, Devaraman, Nagaraman, and Bhutaraman. Going up from there, the Nandan forest contains Nandan and Upanandan, the Saumanas forest contains Saumanas and Upasaumanas, and the Panduka forest contains Panduka and Upapanduka. || 304-309 || If one ascends eleven parts in these parts on Meru, then the width becomes one part less than the width of the original part. Similarly, in all places, from yojanas to angulas, hands, etc., the decrease and increase in the extent of Meru should be understood. Meaning - If one ascends eleven yojanas from the first part of the eleven parts mentioned above, then the width of Meru becomes one yojana less than the width of the original part. And if one ascends eleven hands or eleven angulas, then the width there becomes one hand or one angula less than the width of the original part. Similarly, if one comes down from above
★ Mount Meru is ninety thousand yojanas high. From the pinnacle downwards, there are six sections, each sixteen thousand five hundred yojanas wide. They are made of Lohitaksha and other gems, so their names are also given according to them.

In it is the palace of Saptaparna, which is of the same size as the eastern one. ||427|| In the south-west direction of the Campaka forest is the city of Campakapura, and in the west-north direction of the Amra forest is the city of Amrapura. ||428|| The gods Vijayanta and others, three in number, are the lords of the cities in the south and other directions, and their palaces, air, and families are all like those of Vijayadeva. ||429||

Thus ends the description of Jambudvipa. Now we describe the Salt Ocean.

The Salt Ocean, with its vedika, is two lakh yojanas wide, and it surrounds Jambudvipa like a moat. ||430|| Its circumference is slightly less than fifteen lakh eighty-one thousand one hundred and forty-nine yojanas. ||431|| And its area is eighteen thousand nine hundred and seventy-three crore, sixty-six lakh, fifty-nine thousand six hundred yojanas. ||432-433|| Its width above and below is ten thousand yojanas, its depth is one thousand yojanas, and its height is eleven yojanas. ||434|| The Salt Ocean is one angula deep after going ninety angulas from the shore, one hasta deep after going ninety hastas, and one yojana deep after going ninety yojanas. ||435|| And it is sixteen angulas high after going ninety angulas from the shore, sixteen hastas high after going ninety hastas, and sixteen yojanas high after going ninety yojanas. ||436||

The water of the ocean rises up to five thousand yojanas in the bright fortnight and decreases to eleven thousand yojanas in the dark fortnight. ||437||
In the bright fortnight, the ocean increases by three hundred and thirty-three yojanas and one-third of a yojana every day, and decreases by the same amount in the dark fortnight. ||438||
At the end of the vedi, the ocean is as fine as the wing of a fly, but when its water increases, it rises up to half a yojana. ||439||
In the bright fortnight, the ocean increases by two hundred and sixty-six dandas, two hastas, and sixteen angulis every day, and decreases by the same amount in the dark fortnight. ||440||
The ocean, which is contracted below, becomes like a boat, and expands above on the earth, and in the sky, it becomes like two boats joined together, or like a heap of barley, wide below and narrow above. ||441||
After entering ninety-five thousand yojanas from the vedi, there are four pātalavivaras below in all directions. ||442||
Among them, in the east is the pātal, in the south is the baḍvamukha, in the west is the kadambaka, and in the north is the yūpakesara. ||443||
The extent of the root and the front part of these four pātalas is ten thousand yojanas, and the depth and the extent of their middle part is considered to be one hundred thousand yojanas each. ||444||
These pātalavivaras are like balls, that is, their bottom and top are narrow and their middle is wide. The thickness of their vajra-made walls is five hundred yojanas on all sides. ||445||
These vivaras have three parts each, one part is thirty-three thousand three hundred and thirty-three yojanas and one kala. ||446||
In their third upper part, only water remains, in the lower part, strong wind remains, and in the middle part, both water and wind remain in order. ||447||
The wind in the pātalas naturally breathes in and out, and due to this, the water in them rises and falls, that is, when the wind rises, the water rises, and when the wind falls, the water falls. ||448||
The fifteenth part of the pātalas is filled with wind slowly in the bright fortnight, and with water in the dark fortnight. On the new moon and full moon days, their natural state is restored. ||449||
The difference between these pātalavivaras is...

## Fifth Canto

Two hundred thousand and twenty-seven thousand yojanas is the distance between them. Seventy-seven less than a hundred yojanas is the separate distance of each. ||450||

In all four directions, there are four *kshudra patala* (small netherworlds) with a thousand yojanas at the top and bottom, and ten thousand yojanas in the middle. ||451||

The width of the walls of these four is fifty yojanas, and each has three parts, with water and air in harmony as before. ||452||

Each of the three parts is three thousand three hundred and thirty yojanas, and one part is one-third of a yojana. ||453||

The distance between the *patala* in the directions and sub-directions is one hundred thousand and thirteen thousand eighty-five yojanas. ||454||

In the eight intervals between these eight *patala* in the salt ocean, there are a thousand *kshudra patala*, which appear beautiful like a string of pearls. ||455||

The depth of these *kshudra patala* is one thousand yojanas, and the width is one thousand yojanas in the middle, and one hundred yojanas at the top and bottom. ||456||

These *kshudra patala* are one hundred and twenty-five each in the intervals, and the distance between them is seven hundred and eighty-nine yojanas and a little more than one *krosa*. ||457||

These groups of *patala* are called *kshudra patala* because water enters and exits them as needed. ||458||

Going forty-two thousand yojanas from the shore, there are two mountains in each of the four directions, each a thousand yojanas high. ||459||

On either side of the *patala* in the east are two silver mountains, *Kaustubha* and *Kaustubhas* shaped like half-domes. Their presiding deities (Udak and Udavas) are as glorious as Vijayadeva. ||460||

Near the *Kadambaka patala* in the south are two mountains, *Udak* and *Udavas*. Their presiding deities are Shiva and Shivadeva respectively. ||461||

Near the *Badvamukha patala* in the west are two mountains, *Shankha* and *Mahashankha*. Their presiding deities are Shiva and Shivadeva, who are as glorious as Shankha. ||462||

Near the *Bhupakesara patala* in the north are two mountains, *Udak* and *Udavas*. Their presiding deities are Rohit and Lohithank. ||463||

The distance between these mountains, with their respective Patala-caves, is sixteen thousand yojanas. 

**464**

On top of these mountains, there are many cities built, where the Naga-Kumaras of the Velandhara clan reside with their lords.

**465**

Forty-two thousand Naga-Kumaras, by their duty, hold the inner boundary of the salt ocean, while seventy-two thousand Naga-Kumaras, with a strong devotion to water-sports, always hold the outer boundary of the salt ocean, which is full of water.

**466-467**

Twenty-eight thousand Naga-Kumaras hold the elevated peak of the salt ocean.

**468**

Twelve yojanas to the west-north of the salt ocean, there is an island called Gotama, which is twelve thousand yojanas wide and equal on all sides. Gotama Deva is the presiding deity of this island. In terms of family and other aspects, Gotama Deva is equal to Kaustubha Deva.

**469-470**

In the east of the salt ocean, there are people with one leg, in the south, those with horns, in the west, those with tails, and in the north, those who are mute.

**471**

In all four directions, there are people with ears like those of a rabbit. To the north and south of the one-legged people, there are people with faces like horses and lions respectively.

**472**

On both sides of the horned people, there are people with ears like those of a Shashkuli, and on both sides of the tailed people, there are people with faces like dogs and monkeys respectively.

**473**

On both sides of the mute people, there are people with ears like those of a Shashkuli. On both sides of the Vijaya mountain, which extends into the east-west ocean, there are people with faces like cows and sheep respectively.

**474**

On the eastern and western corners of the Himavat mountain, there are people with faces like meteors and black faces respectively. On the eastern and western corners of the Shikhari mountain, there are people with faces like clouds and lightning respectively.

**475**

On both corners of the Airavat region, which is Vijaya, there are people with faces like mirrors and hands respectively. These twenty-four islands are the abodes of the aforementioned people.

**476**

The islands in the directions and sub-directions are five hundred yojanas away from the coast of the ocean, the islands in the intermediate directions are five hundred and fifty yojanas away, and the islands on the corners of the mountains are six hundred yojanas away. In front of these islands, there is a mountain each.

## Fifth Chapter

**103**

These islands, which are located on the shores of the mountains, are twenty-five yojanas in extent.  Their ninety-fifth part is submerged in water, and they are surrounded by platforms that rise one yojana above the water.  [479]  Multiplying this ninety-fifth part by sixteen, the area above and below the water should be considered as covered by water.  [480]  The number of islands near Jambudvipa in the salt ocean is equal to the number of islands near the Dhataki Khanda.  [481]  There are eighteen classes of beings in these islands, who are called Kubhoga-bhumis, and they have a lifespan of one palya.  [482]  The Ek-orugas, who live in caves and eat sweet earth, are one-legged human beings.  [483]  The rest of the human beings eat flowers and fruits, and live under trees.  They eat once every day, and after death, they become Vyantara and Bhavanavasi Devas.  [484]  The Jagati (platform) of the salt ocean is similar to the Jagati of Jambudvipa.  It has a layer of stone in the inner part and a row of forests in the outer part.  [485]  Multiplying the extent of any island or ocean by four and subtracting three from it, the measure of its final mandala's Suchi is obtained.  [486]  According to this calculation, the Suchi of the salt ocean is five lakhs.  Subtracting two lakhs for the extent, three lakhs remain.  Multiplying this by four, we get twelve lakhs.  Multiplying this by the extent, which is two lakhs, we get twenty-four lakhs.  In this way, the salt ocean...

The **Harivamsha Purana** states that the diameter of the four **Merus** on the earth is 4,400 yojanas. [516] Their circumference on the earth is 19,725 yojanas. [517] 

Going up 500 yojanas from the earth, there is the vast **Nandanavana** (garden of paradise), and 55,500 yojanas above that is the **Saumanasavana** (garden of happiness). [518] 

Going 28,499 yojanas above the **Saumanasavana**, there is the vast **Pandukavana** (garden of white). [519] 

The diameter of the **Meru** in the **Nandanavana** is 9,350 yojanas. [520] 

The outer circumference of the **Meru** in the **Nandanavana** is 19,566 yojanas. [521] 

The inner diameter of the **Meru** excluding the **Nandanavana** is 8,350 yojanas. [522] 

The circumference of the **Meru** in relation to the **Nandanavana** is 26,405 yojanas. [523] 

The outer diameter of the **Meru** in the **Saumanasavana** is 3,800 yojanas, and the inner diameter is 1,000 yojanas less than that. [524] 

The outer circumference of the **Meru** in the **Saumanasavana** is 12,016 yojanas. [525] 

The inner circumference of the **Meru** in the **Saumanasavana** is 8,854 yojanas. [526] 

The circumference of the **Meru** in the **Pandukavana** is 3,162 yojanas, and it should be understood that it is slightly more than one **kosha**. [527] 

The **Samarundra** (mountains of equal width) are 10,000 yojanas above the **Nandanavana**. From there onwards, they gradually decrease in size, and this decrease should also be understood in relation to the **Saumanasavana**. The decrease is one-tenth from the base, meaning that for every 10,000 yojanas of height, there is a decrease of 1,000 yojanas, for every 10 hands of height, there is a decrease of 1 hand, and for every 10 angulas of height, there is a decrease of 1 angula.

In the Harivamsha Purana, the extent of the eastern Vijay is said to be the same as that of the river. The last extent of the western Vijay is also the same. ||55||

The extent of Vijay increases by four thousand five hundred eighty-four yojanas. ||551||

The extent of the Vaksara mountains increases by four hundred seventy-seven yojanas and sixty kalas. ||552||

The extent of the Vibhang rivers increases by one hundred nineteen yojanas and fifty-two kalas, as the experts in growth say. ||553||

The growth of the Devaranya is two thousand seven hundred ninety-nine yojanas and ninety-two kalas. ||554||

The extent of the Padma region is two hundred ninety-nine thousand six hundred twenty-three yojanas and one hundred ninety-nine kalas. ||555||

The initial extent of the Vaksara mountains, the region, and the rivers, which is without growth, is the same as their middle extent. And the middle extent, which has growth, is the same as their final extent. This should be understood in order. ||556||

The regions, the Vaksara mountains, and the Vibhang rivers are situated opposite each other on both banks of the Sita and the Sotoda rivers, and they have the same extent. ||557||

The Videhas, which are east of the western Meru, are the same as the Videhas, which are east of the eastern Meru, in order. ||558||

In this Dhataki-khand, there are one hundred forty-four regions, each with an extent of one lakh yojanas, which are the same as Jambudvipa. The total area of the Dhataki-khand is one lakh thirteen thousand eight hundred forty-one crore ninety-nine lakh fifty-seven thousand six hundred sixty-one yojanas. ||559-561||

Thus, the description of the Dhataki-khand is done. Now, we describe the Kalodadhi.

The Kalodadhi ocean, which is twice the extent of the Dhataki-khand island, is black in color and surrounds the Dhataki-khand island from all sides. ||562||

Its circumference is considered to be ninety-nine lakh seventy thousand six hundred five yojanas, slightly more. ||563||

The learned scholars have collected six hundred seventy-two regions, each with an extent of one lakh yojanas, which are the same as Jambudvipa, in the Kalodadhi ocean. ||564||

The total area of the Kalodadhi ocean is five lakh seventy-nine thousand eighty yojanas. ||565-566||

Kalodadhi...

## Fifth Canto:

The beings in the eastern direction of the Kalodadhi (ocean) have faces like water, those in the south have ears like horses, those in the west have faces like birds, and those in the Vidiśās (intermediate directions) have faces like pigs.  The beings with faces like water in the east have camel-like ears to their south and cow-like ears to their north.  On either side of the beings with elephant-like ears and horse-like ears are beings with cat-like faces, and on either side of the beings with bird-like faces are beings with elephant-like faces.  Their ears are so long that they use them as blankets and pillows.  

At the two ends of the Vijayadhan mountain in the Kalodadhi are beings with faces like crocodiles and those with faces like sharks.  At the two ends of the Himavan mountain are beings with faces like wolves and tigers, and at the two ends of the Śikhari mountain are beings with faces like jackals and bears.  At the two ends of the Airavata region, which is related to the Vijayadhan mountain, are beings with faces like cheetahs and those with faces like Bhanga (a type of thorny bush).  In the outer and inner Jagatī (regions) are beings with faces like cheetahs.  

All these beings are similar to the beings of the Lavana (salty) ocean in terms of lifespan, color, houses, food, and movement.  These islands are a thousand yojanas deep, and the shore of the ocean where they are located is broken.  

These islands in the Kalodadhi are more than five hundred yojanas in length from the entrance.  The islands in the directions are located five hundred yojanas from the shore, the islands in the Vidiśās are located five hundred and fifty yojanas from the entrance, and the islands in the Anta-diśās (extreme directions) are located six hundred yojanas from the entrance.  The size of all these islands is considered to be twice that of the islands in the Lavana ocean.  

There are twenty-four islands in the inner region of the Kalodadhi (near the Dhātakokhaṇḍa) and twenty-four islands in the outer region (near the Puṣkarārdha).  Thus, there are forty-eight islands in the Kalodadhi.  Together with the forty-eight islands of the Lavana ocean, the total number of islands in the inner region is eighty-nine.  

This is the description of the Kalodadhi.  Now we will describe the Puṣkar island, which has two Meru mountains in the east and west, is twice the size of the Kalodadhi, and is marked by a large lotus symbol.  This Puṣkar island surrounds the Kalodadhi on all sides.  

Half of the Puṣkar island is considered to be the boundary of the human region, which is marked by the beings with faces like jackals...

**580-583.** The inner diameter of the Bharata region of the Pushkarardha is forty-one thousand five hundred eighty-nine yojanas and one hundred seventy-seven parts. The middle diameter is thirty-three thousand five hundred twelve yojanas and one hundred ninety-nine parts. The outer diameter is said to be sixty-five thousand four hundred forty-six yojanas and thirteen parts.

**588.** The Vijayardha, Nabhigiri, and Kulachal, etc., of the Pushkarardha are equal to the Vijayardha, etc., of the Jambudvipa in terms of their height and depth.

**589.** However, in terms of diameter, the Vijayardha, etc., of the Dhataki-khanda are twice the size. The two Ishva-shaped mountains and the two Meru mountains of the Pushkarardha are similar to the Ishva-shaped mountains and Meru mountains of the Dhataki-khanda.

## The Fifth Canto

**The Self-Born Delight (Svayambhuramana) and the Oceans:**

There are sixteen oceans, each named after the island it surrounds, along with the Self-Born Delight (Svayambhuramana) island and ocean.  These are the final sixteen islands and oceans.  

Between these two sets of sixteen, there are countless islands and oceans, all with auspicious names from the beginning of time.  These islands and oceans alternate, with an island always followed by an ocean, and an ocean always followed by an island.

The Salt Ocean (Lavana) tastes like salt, the Varuni Ocean tastes like Varuni wine, the Grita Ocean tastes like ghee, and the Kshira Ocean tastes like milk.  The Kalodadhi Ocean and the final Self-Born Delight Ocean taste like water.  The Pushkara Ocean tastes like both honey and water.  All the remaining oceans taste like sugarcane juice.

The great sea-monsters (Mahamacchas) born from fainting (Sammurccha) in the Salt Ocean are nine yojanas long on the shore and eighteen yojanas long in the middle.  The sea-monsters born from the rivers (Nadimakha) in the Kalodadhi Ocean are eighteen yojanas long on the shore and thirty-six yojanas long in the middle.  The sea-monsters born from the womb (Garbhajanma) are half the size of the sea-monsters born from fainting.

The sea-monsters in the Self-Born Delight Ocean are five hundred yojanas long on the shore and one thousand yojanas long in the middle.  There are no sea-creatures in any other ocean except the Salt Ocean, the Kalodadhi Ocean, and the Self-Born Delight Ocean.

Creatures with impaired senses (two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed) live up to the Manushottara mountain.  Beyond that, they are found from the middle of the Self-Born Delight island to its end.

If you want to know the extent of an island or ocean, add one hundred thousand yojanas to the combined extent of all the islands and oceans that come before it.

The middle of the Self-Born Delight Ocean is located at a distance of seventy-five thousand yojanas from the center of the half-diameter of Mount Meru.  This is the middle of the half-radius of the entire middle world.

**Explanation:**

The entire middle world is one raju in extent.  The half-radius from the center of Mount Meru to the end of the Self-Born Delight Ocean is one half-raju.  Half of this half-raju contains half of Jambudvipa, countless islands and oceans, and the final seventy-five thousand yojanas of the Self-Born Delight Ocean.  The other half of the half-raju contains...

In the Harivamsha Purana,
A mountain known as Swayamprabha, situated in the middle of the Swayambhuraman island, shines brightly in the form of a ring. || 730 || Between the Manushottara and Swayamprabha mountains, there are countless islands inhabited by Tiryanchas, whose inferior Bhogabhumi resembles that of Tiryanchas. || 731 || Beyond the Swayamprabha mountain, there are Tiryanchas who are similar to the Karmabhumij Tiryanchas, as there are countless Tiryanchas who are both Sanayata and Asanayata - Deshavratis. || 732 || In the aforementioned island seas and on the beautiful mountains, Vyantar Devas like Kinnaras reside as per their respective nature. || 733 || Gautama Swami says, "O Shrenika! You have now understood the Prajnapti related to the island seas. Now listen to the Prajnapti related to the Jyotirloka and Udhvaloka in brief." || 734 || This clear collection of the Prajnapti related to the Jambudvipa and the Lavanasamudra, as well as the best of islands and seas, is accepted by the Munis. Whoever listens to this, their doubts regarding the Bhuloka are destroyed. This is indeed true. For when the sun, in the form of a Muni, rises, how can the group of darkness remain? It cannot. || 735 ||

**Verse 33:** In the islands and oceans like Dhataki-khand, the suns and moons are tripled in number. Notably, the number of suns and moons from the previous islands and oceans must also be included. For example, the number of suns and moons in the Kalodadhi ocean is forty-two. This is calculated as follows: The previous island to Kalodadhi is Dhataki-khand, which has twelve suns and moons. Tripling this number gives thirty-six. Adding the six suns and moons from the Lavana ocean and Jambudvipa to this, we get forty-two suns and moons in Kalodadhi. Similarly, there are seventy-two suns and moons from Manushottara to Pushkaravara, and seventy-two more beyond that, making a total of one hundred and forty-four. The method of calculating this is as follows: Tripling the number of suns and moons in Kalodadhi, which is forty-two, gives one hundred and twenty-six. Adding the twelve from Kalodadhi, four from the Lavana ocean, and two from Jambudvipa, a total of eighteen, to this, we get one hundred and forty-four. The same method should be applied to the subsequent islands and oceans.

**Verse 34:** This is a brief description of the divisions of the Jyotirloka. Now, a brief description of the divisions of the Urdhvaloka is presented.

**Verse 35:** The Urdhvaloka begins with the summit of Mount Meru, meaning it is above the summit. Above the summit are the heavens and the Graiveyakas, etc.

**Verse 36-38:** There are sixteen kalpas: 1. Saudharma, 2. Aishana, 3. Sanatkumara, 4. Maheindra, 5. Brahma, 6. Brahmottara, 7. Lantava, 8. Kapishtha, 9. Shukra, 10. Mahashukra, 11. Shatara, 12. Sahasrar, 13. Anata, 14. Pranata, 15. Aran, and 16. Achyuta. These are arranged in pairs, with a distinction between south and north.

**Verse 39:** Above them are three types of Graiveyakas: Adhograiveyak, Madhyagraiveyak, and Uparigraiveyak. Each of these three Graiveyakas is further divided into three categories: Adi, Madhy, and Urdhva. These Graiveyakas have nine patalas.

**Verse 40:** Beyond them are: 1. Laksh Laksh. * Nine Veiyaka: 1. Sudarshan, 2. Amogha, 3. Suprabuddha, 4. Yashovara, 5. Subhadra, 6. Vishala, 7. Suman, 8. Saumanasa, 9. Pritikara.

## Translation:

126
In the Harivamsha Purana, the twenty-first chapter describes the three types of Vimanas (aerial vehicles) in detail. There are seventeen types of Vimanas in the first category, nine in the second, and five in the third.  ||76||  These Vimanas are classified as pure, and their numbers are based on their respective original quantities. The remaining Vimanas are known as scattered Vimanas. ||77||  

The number of Vimanas with a measurable Yojan (unit of distance) extent in each of these categories is as follows:

* In the Saudharma heaven, there are six lakhs forty thousand Vimanas.
* In the Aishana heaven, there are five lakhs sixty thousand Vimanas.
* In the Sanatkumara heaven, there are two lakhs forty thousand Vimanas.
* In the Maheindra heaven, there are one lakh sixty thousand Vimanas.
* In the Brahma and Brahmottara heavens, there are eighty thousand Vimanas.
* In the Lantava and Kapishtha heavens, there are ten thousand Vimanas.
* In the Shukra heaven, there are four thousand four Vimanas.
* In the Mahashukra heaven, there are three thousand nine hundred ninety-six Vimanas.
* In the Shatara-Sahasrar heaven, there are twelve hundred Vimanas.
* In the Anata-Pranata heaven, there are eighty-eight Vimanas.
* In the Aruna-Achyuta heaven, there are fifty-two Vimanas. ||78-84||

The number of Vimanas with immeasurable Yojan extent in all these heavens is four times the number of Vimanas with measurable Yojan extent. ||85||

Except for the Indraka Vimanas, the remaining Vimanas in the Nav-Preveya and other categories are of two types: those with measurable Yojan extent and those with immeasurable Yojan extent. The Indraka Vimanas are only of the measurable Yojan extent type. ||86||

The total number of Vimanas with measurable Yojan extent is sixteen lakhs ninety thousand three hundred eighty, and the number of Vimanas with immeasurable Yojan extent is sixty-four lakhs ninety thousand six hundred ninety. ||87-88||

The Prarabhara-Bhum (Siddhashil), the two and a half Dvipas, the Ritu Vimana of the first heaven, the Simantaka Indraka Vimana of the first Naraka (hell), and the Siddhalaya are all equal in extent, each measuring forty-five lakhs Yojan. The Ritu Vimana is located at a distance of a hair's breadth from the peak of Mount Meru, the Chulika. ||89||

The Jambudvipa, the Apratisthana Indraka Vimana of the seventh Naraka, and the Sarvarthasiddhi are all considered to be of equal extent by the learned Acharyas, each measuring one hundred and sixty lakhs Yojan. ||90||

## Chapter 128

**From the Harivamsha Purana, the following is the description of the celestial realms in the south and north directions:**

**102.** The celestial rulers, free from animosity, reside in the midst of the ocean of happiness.

**103.** The origin of the *tapasas* (ascetics) is in the *vyantara* and *jyotishi* realms. The *parivrajaka yogis* (wandering ascetics) are found up to the Brahma realm.

**104.** The *samyag-dristi ajivakas* (those with right faith and livelihood) can reach the *sahasrar* realm. Beyond that, no being can reach through any other *linga* (mark) except the *jina-linga* (mark of the Jina).

**105.** The *shravakas* (lay followers) traverse from the *saudharma* realm to the *achyuta* realm, while the *shramanas* (monks) go beyond.

**106.** The *abhavya* (non-liberated) beings can attain the *agni-graiveyaka* realm. However, their attainment in the *graiveyaka* realms is only possible through the *nirgrantha-linga* (mark of the liberated) and intense *tapas* (austerity).

**107.** The *ratnatraya* (three jewels) are the source of the *bhavya* (liberated) beings, until they attain *sarvartha-siddhi* (complete enlightenment).

**108.** In the *bhavanavasi*, *vyantara*, and *jyotishi* realms, the *dravya* (matter) and *bhava* (state of being) are characterized by the *krishna*, *nila*, and *kapota* *leshya* (shades), as well as the *jghanya* (inferior) *pita* *leshya*.

**109.** The *saudharma* and *sanatkumar* realms have a *madhyama* (medium) *pita* *leshya*. The *mahendra* realm has an *utkrista* (superior) *pita* *leshya* and a *jghanya* (inferior) *padma* *leshya*.

**110.** In the next three pairs of realms, the *madhyama* (medium) *padma* *leshya* prevails. In the subsequent two pairs, the *utkrista* (superior) *padma* *leshya* and the *jghanya* (inferior) *shukla* *leshya* are found.

**111.** In the four realms from *achyuta* onwards and the nine *graiveyaka* realms, the *madhyama* (medium) *shukla* *leshya* is present for all the deities.

**112.** In the fourteen *vimanas* (celestial chariots) of the *ahamindra* (self-ruling) deities, the *param shukla* *leshya* (supreme white shade) prevails. These *ahamindras* are free from all *samklesha* (afflictions).

113. The range of knowledge (avadhi) of the deities of the first two heavens extends up to the Dharmā earth. The range of the deities of the next two heavens extends up to the Vamśā earth.
114. The range of the deities of the next four heavens extends up to the Meghā earth. The range of the deities of the next four heavens extends up to the Anjana earth.
115. The range of the deities of the Ānata and the next three heavens extends up to the Ariṣṭā earth. The range of the Nava-Graiveyaka deities extends up to the sixth earth.
116. The range of the Nava-Anudisa deities extends up to the end of the seventh earth. The range of the Pañcānuttara deities extends up to the entire Lokanāḍī.
117. The range of the visual knowledge (cakṣuḥ) of all the deities extends up to the end of their respective vimānas, as the omniscient ones know.
118. The duration, height, and conduct (pravīcārā) of the deities of the four classes (nikāya) should be understood as described by the Jina.
119. The goddesses of the deities from the Āraṇa heaven up to the Saudharma heaven are born in their own abodes in the Saudharma heaven and are taken to their respective places by the presiding deities.
120. The beautiful goddesses of the deities from the Acyuta heaven up to the Īśāna heaven are born in the Īśāna heaven and go to their respective abodes.
121. The lords of the munis have stated that there are six hundred thousand and four hundred thousand pure goddesses-bearing vimānas in the Saudharma and Īśāna heavens respectively.
122-123. These deities, adorned with divine clothes and ornaments, endowed with auspicious forms and captivating gestures, skilled in the art of love, and possessing natural love as their domain, along with numerous goddesses of immeasurable lifespan, enjoy great happiness.
124. The Indras, Sāmānikas, and the thirty-three and other deities who have attained the state of the Kalpopapanna live long lives.
125. The Ahamindras beyond them enjoy the infinite happiness arising from the maturation of the Sātāvedanīya, which is devoid of females and is born from the tranquil self.
126. The supreme abode of the Siddhas is twelve yojanas beyond, situated at the summit of the three worlds, attained by the complete fulfillment of all objectives.
127. The eighth earth, known as Īṣatprāgbhārā, is said to be the largest, gradually decreasing in size towards the center.

Page #168:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, it is said that the earth is eight yojanas thick at its center, gradually thinning out towards its edges, becoming extremely subtle, reaching a size that is an infinitesimal fraction of an angula. It is shaped like a vast, white umbrella, rising upwards. ||127-128|| Scholars say that the earth's diameter is forty-five lakh yojanas. ||129|| Its circumference is one crore forty-two lakh thirty thousand two hundred ninety yojanas. ||130|| Above the earth are the three previously mentioned vata-valayas (wind circles). Two of these circles, with a diameter of three kosas, are surpassed by the third, the tanu-vata-valaya, which is one thousand five hundred seventy-five dhanus wide. ||131|| At the end of this tanu-vata-valaya, which is five hundred twenty-five dhanus thick, reside the Siddhas, having attained their supreme state of liberation. ||132|| The space of the sky where the Siddhas reside is considered to be three and a half hastas less than the height of their bodies, which was previously stated to be three and a half hastas. ||133-134|| Where one Siddha, having achieved his purpose, resides, there also reside infinite other Siddhas, each in their own state of liberation. ||135|| These Siddhas are bodiless, blissful, and filled with the essence of jivas. They know all the lokas and alokas, with their infinite permutations and combinations, simultaneously, and remain eternally happy. ||136-137|| The Siddhas are pure, enlightened, free from birth, ageless, and unbound by karma. They reside eternally in their unshakeable abode. ||138||

Gautama Swami says, "O noble श्रेणिक! Thus, I have explained to you the field of knowledge for your benefit. This is a good thing to hear, and it is for your benefit. Therefore, O Vayuṣman, pay attention and listen to the teachings of time." ||139||

## Sixth Canto

### 131

**Dharma-dhyana**, bright and radiant, is the cause of liberation, as declared by the Jinas. It is the restraint of mental activities through the understanding of the **Ajnana-vichya**, **Apaya-vichya**, **Vipaka-vichya**, and **Sansthana-vichya**.  Those who are engrossed in the contemplation of the structure of the world, the performance of actions, and the gathering of wealth, are not easily controlled by their senses, which are like intoxicated elephants and horses.  

**Thus ends the sixth canto of the Harivamsa Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which describes the Jyotirloka and the higher realms, and contains a collection of the Puranas of the Ariṣṭanemi Jina.**

**1.  ** *Bhedendriyasvavidheyah* **(K, Kh, G, Gh)**

**Explanation:**  The text emphasizes the importance of **Dharma-dhyana** for liberation. It highlights the need to control the senses, which are often likened to wild animals, to achieve spiritual progress.  The text also emphasizes the importance of understanding the nature of the world, actions, and their consequences. 

**139:**  This section provides a concise summary of the previous chapters, highlighting the description of the Jyotirloka, the celestial realms, and the path to liberation. It then transitions to the discussion of time and matter.

**140:**  This verse emphasizes the need for self-control and the dangers of allowing the senses to dominate one's actions. It warns that those who are consumed by worldly desires and pursuits will find it difficult to control their senses and achieve liberation. 

**Note:**  The text uses several Jain terms, including **Dharma-dhyana**, **Ajnana-vichya**, **Apaya-vichya**, **Vipaka-vichya**, and **Sansthana-vichya**. These terms are central to Jain philosophy and refer to the practice of meditation, the understanding of ignorance, the nature of hellish realms, the consequences of actions, and the structure of the universe, respectively.

## Seventh Chapter

The time-substance is devoid of color, smell, taste, and touch, and is light and heavy, and is characterized by its movement. It is of two types: primary and secondary. ||1||

Just as the dharma-substance is the cause for the movement of the jiva and pudgala, the adharma-substance is the cause for their staying, and the akasha-substance is the cause for their pervading all substances, similarly, the **determining time-substance** is the cause for the movement of all substances in the form of six-fold loss and gain, i.e., the transformation. ||2||

Just as the dharma, adharma, and akasha-substances are determined by the knowledge of the scriptures, similarly, the wise should also determine the time-substance. ||3||

The transformation of jivas and pudgalas is of many kinds, and the activity of the secondary time is dependent on the primary time. ||4||

All substances undergo transformation in the form of becoming and ceasing, and these transformations are caused by their internal and external causes. ||5||

Among these internal and external causes, the internal cause is the inherent potentiality of the substance, which always resides in it, and the external cause is the **determining time-substance**, as determined by the wise teachers. ||6||

The time-atoms, devoid of mutual penetration, exist separately, pervading all the realms and the space, and are accumulated in the form of a mass. ||7||

From the perspective of the substance-realization, the time-atoms are devoid of transformation, and hence, being free from production and destruction, they are eternal and remain in their own nature. ||8||

From the perspective of the relative-realization, due to the presence of the qualities of lightness and heaviness, the time-atoms undergo transformation every moment, and due to their dependence on other substances, they are also impermanent. ||9||

The time-atoms are considered to be of three types because they are the cause of the three types of time: past, present, and future. They are also called infinite because they are the producers of infinite times. ||10||

The time arises from those causal time-atoms, and it is true that without a cause, an effect never arises. ||11||

If an effect, which is non-existent, arises on its own without a cause, then why does the horn of a donkey not arise on its own? ||12||

The time-effect does not arise from any cause other than time, because a sprout of barley never arises from a seed of rice. ||13||

Page #171:
---------------------------
## Seventh Chapter

133. Where a heterogeneous cause is the producer of an effect, there it is a cooperative cause. There, the main cause is the material cause, and the cooperative cause is its assistant. ||14||

134. Thus, for those who are not endowed with superhuman vision, i.e., who only perceive gross objects, the concordance of the main time is established by the force of reasoning and scriptural authority. ||15||

135. Time, Avali, Ucchvasa, Pran, Stoka, and Lava, etc., should be understood as the time of action, as described by the knowers of time. ||16||

136. The time taken by a single atom to traverse its own space, with the slowest possible motion, is called a Samaya by the knowers of the Shakha. This Samaya is indivisible and prevents the acceptance of any other time. ||17-18||

137. An innumerable number of Samayas constitute an Avali, a countable number of Avalis constitute an Ucchvasa-Nischvasa, two Ucchvasa-Nischvasas constitute a Pran. Seven Pranas constitute a Stoka, seven Stokas constitute a Lava, seventy Lavas constitute a Muhurta, thirty Muhurtas constitute a day-night, fifteen day-nights constitute a Paksha, two Pakshas constitute a Masa, two Masas constitute a Ritu, three Ritus constitute an Ayana, two Ayanas constitute a year, five years constitute a Yuga, two Yugas constitute ten years, multiplying by ten, it becomes a hundred years, multiplying by ten, it becomes a thousand years, multiplying by ten, it becomes ten thousand years, multiplying by ten, it becomes a lakh years. Multiplying by eighty-four, it becomes a Purvang, eighty-four lakh Purvangs constitute a Purva, eighty-four lakh Purvas constitute a Niyutaang, eighty-four lakh Niyutaangs constitute a Niyut, eighty-four lakh Niyuts constitute a Kumudaang, eighty-four lakh Kumudaangs constitute a Kumud, eighty-four lakh Kumuds constitute a Padmaang, eighty-four lakh Padmaangs constitute a Padma, eighty-four lakh Padmas constitute a Nalinaang, eighty-four lakh Nalinaangs constitute a Nalin, eighty-four lakh Nalins constitute a Kamalaang, eighty-four lakh Kamalaangs constitute a Kamal, eighty-four lakh Kamals constitute a Tuvyaang, eighty-four lakh Tuvyaangs constitute a Tuvya, eighty-four lakh Tuvyas constitute an Attatang, eighty-four lakh Attatangs constitute an Attama, eighty-four lakh Attama constitute an Amaang, eighty-four lakh Amaangs constitute an Ama. ||28||

One Atat is called a Atatanga, eighty-four lakhs Atatangas make an Amamanga, eighty-four lakhs Amamangas make an Amama, eighty-four lakhs Amas make an Uhaanga, eighty-four lakhs Uhaangas make an Uha, eighty-four lakhs Uhas make a Latanga, eighty-four lakhs Latangas make a Lata, eighty-four lakhs Latas make a Mahalatanga, eighty-four lakhs Mahalatangas make a Mahalata, eighty-four lakhs Mahalatas make a Shirah Prakampita, eighty-four lakhs Shirah Prakampitas make a Hasta Prahelika, and eighty-four lakhs Hasta Prahelikas make a  Charchika. Thus, from Charchika onwards, the time is counted. || 19-30 ||
The time which is devoid of the number of years is considered to be infinite. It has many divisions like Paly, Sagar, Kalpa and Ananta etc. || 31 ||
That which is devoid of beginning, middle and end, is indivisible, is beyond the senses, and though it is material, is devoid of space - the second and other spaces, is called a Paramanu. || 32 ||
That Paramanu, in one time, holds one Rasa, one Varna, one Gandha and two Sparshas which do not obstruct each other, is impenetrable, is the cause of sound and is itself devoid of sound. || 33 ||
Those who know the nature of the substance should not have such a doubt that due to the connection with six parts of the sky from all sides at one time, there is a six-partness in the Paramanu. || 34 ||
Because if we assume so, then the six small parts of the sky and one Paramanu together become seven parts. Now how can there be six-partness in the Paramanu? || 35 ||
Because the Paramanus keep on filling and melting due to colour, smell, taste and touch, therefore, like the Skandha, the Paramanus are Pudgala Dravyas. || 36 ||
The group of infinite infinite Paramanus is called Avasanjna. These Avasanjna etc. are the types of Skandha. || 37 ||
The eight Avasanjna are: 1. Antadimjjahiinam Apedesam Indiehi Gahu Gejjam. Jam Davvam Avibhattam Tam Paramanum Vadanti Jina || 98 || 2. Paramanuhi Anantanantehi Bahuvihehi Dehi |
Avasannaasannoti So Khandho Hoi Namein || 102 || Uvasannaasanno Vi Ya Gunido Attehi Hodi Namein. Sanasannoti Tado Du Idi Khandho Pamanattum || 103 || Ahi Gunidehi Sanasaha Hodi Tudireinu. Tittiya Meittahadehi Tu Direnuhi Pitasareinu || 104 || Tasarenu Rathu Renui Uttamabhogavanie Balagan.

It has been said that one **trutirenu** is made up of eight **sanjna-sanjna**. [One **trasarenu** is made up of eight **trutirenu**, one **rathrenu** is made up of eight **trasarenu**, one **uttama bhogabhumij** man's hair tip is made up of eight **rathrenu**, one **madhyama bhogabhumij** man's hair tip is made up of eight **uttama bhogabhumij** man's hair tips, and one **jghanya bhogabhumij** man's hair tip is made up of eight **madhyama bhogabhumij** man's hair tips.] One **karmabhumij** man's hair tip is made up of eight **jghanya bhogabhumij** man's hair tips. One **likha** is made up of eight **karmabhumij** man's hair tips, one **ju** is made up of eight **likha**, one **jo** is made up of eight **ju**, and one **utsedhangul** is made up of eight **jo**. The height of living beings and the measurement of small objects are taken with this **utsedhangul**.

**39-41**

One **pramanangul** is obtained by multiplying **utsedhangul** by five hundred. This **pramanangul** is the finger of the first **chakravarti** of the **avasarpini**.

**42**

The height, width, etc. of large islands, oceans, etc. are known accordingly with this **angul**.

**43**

The **angul** of humans in their respective times is considered their **swangul**. The extent of umbrellas, pots, and cities, etc. is measured by it.

**44**

One **pad** is made up of six **angul**, one **vitasti** is made up of two **pad**, one **hast** is made up of two **vitasti**, and one **kishku** is made up of two **hast**.

**45**

One **danda** is made up of two **kishku**, and **dhanush** or **nadi** is also considered equal to **danda**. One **yojana** is said to be made up of eight thousand **danda**.

**46**

A **gatam** is made which is one **praman yojana** long, wide, and deep, whose circumference is slightly more than three times its length, and which has walls built around it.

**47**

This **gatam** is filled from top to bottom with pieces of sheep's wool, which are not divisible, from one to seven days. This **gatam** is called **vyavharapalya**.

**48**

After one hundred years, one piece of wool is removed from this **gatam**. The time taken for it to become empty is called **vyavharapalyopam kala**.

**49**

After that, in those same pieces of wool, for each piece, as many pieces are imagined by intellect as there are years in countless crores of years, and the **gatam** of the aforementioned measurement is filled with these imagined pieces. This filled **gatam** is called **uddharapalya**, and

## English Translation:

In the Harivamsha Purana, a koti-koti (hundred million) of udharapalyas (units of time) are equal to a udharasagar (ocean of time).  Half of three udharasagars is the measure of a dvipasagar (island ocean). ||51|| The distance (adhya) of a dvipasagar, when doubled, becomes the measure of a rajju (rope). This rajju touches the ends of the tanuvatavalyas (thin rings) in both directions. Wise people use this to calculate the measure of the three lokas (worlds). ||52|| 

An udharapalya is divided into countless crores (ten million) of years, each year being the time it takes for a single hair to be removed from a pit. This is called an addhapalya. The time it takes to empty the pit by removing one hair at a time is called an addhapalyopama kal (time equivalent to an addhapalya). This is used to measure the lifespan of beings. ||53-54||

Ten koti-koti addhapalya make up an addhasagar. This is used to measure the lifespan, karma, and state of existence of beings in the samsara (cycle of birth and death). ||55||

There are ten koti-koti addhasagars in an avasarpini (descending) kal and the same number in an utsarpini (ascending) kal. Each of these has six divisions. ||56||

The avasarpini kal is characterized by a gradual decrease in the power of things, while the utsarpini kal is characterized by a gradual increase. These names are meaningful. ||57||

The six divisions of the avasarpini kal are: 1) Sushamasushamas, 2) Sushama, 3) Sushamadushmas, 4) Dushmasushamas, 5) Dushmas, and 6) Dushmadushmas. The six divisions of the utsarpini kal are the reverse of these: 1) Dushmadushmas, 2) Dushmas, 3) Sushamadushmas, 4) Dushmasushamas, 5) Sushama, and 6) Sushamasushamas. ||58-59||

The measure of the first three kals (periods) is: four koti-koti sagars, three koti-koti sagars, and two koti-koti sagars respectively. ||60||

The measure of the fourth kal is one koti-koti sagars minus forty-two thousand years. The measure of the fifth and sixth kals is twenty-one thousand years each. ||61-62||

Just as there is an avasarpini kal of ten koti-koti sagars, there is also an utsarpini kal of ten koti-koti sagars. Both the avasarpini and utsarpini...

## Seventh Canto

**137**

This land, adorned with Kalpa trees, is the Bhoga-bhoomi in the three ages, while Bharata is the Gabhoomi. ||6||

At the beginning of these three ages, the people of the world were born in pairs, their heights being six thousand, four thousand, and two thousand Dhanus respectively. ||65||

Their lifespans were equal to those of the people of Devakuru, Uttar Kuru, Hari Varsha, and Himavat, respectively, being three Palyas, two Palyas, and one Palyas. ||66||

In these three ages, the men and women were of the color of the rising sun, the full moon, and the Priyangu flower, respectively. ||67||

The number of bones in their backs was two hundred and fifty-six in the first age, one hundred and twenty-eight in the second, and sixty-four in the third. ||68||

Their food, born from the divine Kalpa trees, was the size of a berry in the first age, a Baheda fruit in the second, and an Amalaka fruit in the third, consumed every four days, two days, and two days, respectively. ||69||

Controlled by the three-fold time, this land of Bharata, in those times, adopted the three types of permanent Bhoga-bhoomi customs, meaning that the system here was like that of the eternal, superior, medium, and inferior Bhoga-bhoomi. ||70||

Just as the Ratna-Prabha earth is adorned with layers of permanent jewels, so too, this land of Bharata was adorned with layers of radiant jewels above. ||71||

With Indranila and other blue gems, Jatyamjana and other black gems, Padma-raga and other red gems, Haima and other yellow gems, and Mukta and other white gems, this land, adorned with five colors of gems, shone like the heavenly realm. ||72-73||

With a Chandrakant gem as its face, coral as its lips, and jewels and gold as its garment, this land shone like a woman. ||74||

The rays of the Chandrakant gem are cool, while those of the Suryakant gem are hot. But here, they were not separate from each other, so it seemed as if the cool rays of the Chandrakant were suffering from the cold and did not want to leave the hot rays of the Suryakant. ||75||

The Kalpa and Kala combine to form time. During this time, in the Bharata and Airavata regions, the state of matter is subject to loss and growth. In other regions, the state of matter is free from loss and growth. ||63||

This land of Bharata is called Bhoga-bhoomi in the first three ages, which is truly the land of various kinds of enjoyments. ||64||

At the beginning of those three ages, humans were six thousand, four thousand, and two thousand Dhanus tall, respectively, and the birth of men and women occurred in pairs. ||65||

At that time, their lifespans were equal to those of the people of Devakuru, Uttar Kuru, Hari Varsha, and Himavat, respectively, being three Palyas, two Palyas, and one Palyas. ||66||

In those three ages, men and women were of the color of the rising sun, the full moon, and the Priyangu flower, respectively. ||67||

The number of bones in their backs was two hundred and fifty-six in the first age, one hundred and twenty-eight in the second, and sixty-four in the third. ||68||

Their food, born from the divine Kalpa trees, was the size of a berry in the first age, a Baheda fruit in the second, and an Amalaka fruit in the third, consumed every four days, two days, and two days, respectively. ||69||

Controlled by the three-fold time, this land of Bharata, in those times, adopted the three types of permanent Bhoga-bhoomi customs, meaning that the system here was like that of the eternal, superior, medium, and inferior Bhoga-bhoomi. ||70||

Just as the Ratna-Prabha earth is adorned with layers of permanent jewels, so too, this land of Bharata was adorned with layers of radiant jewels above. ||71||

With Indranila and other blue gems, Jatyamjana and other black gems, Padma-raga and other red gems, Haima and other yellow gems, and Mukta and other white gems, this land, adorned with five colors of gems, shone like the heavenly realm. ||72-73||

With a Chandrakant gem as its face, coral as its lips, and jewels and gold as its garment, this land shone like a woman. ||74||

The rays of the Chandrakant gem are cool, while those of the Suryakant gem are hot. But here, they were not separate from each other, so it seemed as if the cool rays of the Chandrakant were suffering from the cold and did not want to leave the hot rays of the Suryakant. ||75||

1. The number of bones in the back is to be known from this verse.

The land was adorned with figures embracing each other, their forms intoxicated with the love of mutual touch, and with various types of gems, shining as if under the influence of love. ||7|| The land was adorned with grass, four fingers long, of five colors, pleasant to touch, fragrant, flavorful, and melodious. ||7|| The land was adorned with divine ponds and lakes, filled with perfect curd, honey, milk, ghee, and sugarcane juice, and with banks adorned with jewels. ||7|| The land was always adorned with mountains of various colors, adorned with gems, made of gold, and giving happiness to living beings. ||79|| The land was always adorned with Kalpavriksha trees of the following types: 1. Jyotiranga, 2. Grihaanga, 3. Pradeepanga, 4. Turyanga, 5. Bhojanaanga, 6. Bhajanaanga, 7. Vastraanga, 8. Malyanga, 9. Bhushaanga, and 10. Madyaanga. ||80|| The Jyotiranga Kalpavriksha trees, whose radiance covered the discs of the moon and the sun, always adorned the land, erasing the distinction between day and night. ||81|| The Grihaanga Kalpavriksha trees, which were adorned with gardens and had many sections, produced various types of trees that adorned the sky-like courtyard. ||82|| The Pradeepanga Kalpavriksha trees, with their long and wide branches, held new leaves in the shape of lotus buds, shining like lamps. ||83|| The Turyanga Kalpavriksha trees always produced four types of auspicious musical instruments: Tat, Vitat, Dhan, and Sushir. ||84|| The Bhojanaanga Kalpavriksha trees produced various types of food for the enjoyment of humans, filled with six types of flavors, extremely delicious, and divided into four categories: Anna, Pan, Khady, and Lehya. ||85|| The Bhajanaanga Kalpavriksha trees produced many types of utensils made of gems, gold, etc., such as plates, bowls, etc. ||86|| The Vastraanga Kalpavriksha trees wore various types of clothes made of cotton, silk, and wool, on their trunks and branches. ||87||
The rays of the Suryakant gem were suffering from the heat, so they did not want to leave the cool rays of the Chandrakant gem. ||75|| Just as humans, under the influence of love, embrace each other, their bodies intoxicated with love, so too, here, various types of gems embrace each other with their rays, their forms intoxicated and increasing with color. Thus, this land was adorned with gems that seemed to be under the influence of love. ||76|| The land was adorned with grass, four fingers long, of five colors, pleasant to touch, fragrant, flavorful, and melodious. ||77|| The land was adorned with divine ponds and lakes, filled with perfect curd, honey, milk, ghee, and sugarcane juice, and with banks adorned with jewels. ||78|| The land was always adorned with mountains of various colors, adorned with gems, made of gold, and giving happiness to living beings. ||79|| 1.

Here is the English translation, preserving the Jain terms:

The seventh chapter describes the ornate Kalpa trees adorned with the blooming flowers of Malati, Mallika, and others. ॥48॥ Wearing garlands, they shine, the trees that bear flowers on their branches. ॥49॥ Decorated with necklaces, earrings, armlets, girdles, and other ornaments, they appear befitting of both men and women. ॥50॥ The Madya (intoxicating) divisions, the Prasanna and others, which induce intoxication, are produced by the Madya-anga (intoxicating part) trees for the delight and stimulation of human beings. ॥51॥ At that time, the couples enjoy the pleasures arising from the ten-fold Kalpa trees, even more than the pleasures of the lord of the Dasa-anga (ten-limbed) celestial beings. ॥52॥ Then, the embryos of those couples, having rolled about within, pass seven days licking their own thumbs, seven days crawling, seven days with unsteady steps, seven days with steady steps, seven days practicing arts and virtues, and seven days attaining the state of youth. ॥53-54॥ By the seventh week, they acquire the fitness for right belief. ॥55॥ Those pure-sensed and pure-minded beings, skilled in the arts and virtues, enjoy pleasures free from diseases. ॥56॥ The men are like divine youths, and the women are like divine damsels, delightful in color, fragrance, taste, touch, and appearance. ॥57॥ The ear is engrossed in melodious sounds, the eye in beautiful forms, the nose in pleasant fragrances, the tongue in delicious tastes, and the body in delightful touches. ॥58॥ Their minds and senses, ever unsatisfied, are constantly attracted to each other. ॥59॥ Just as human couples enjoy passionately with the Kalpa tree-related foods, so do the contented animal couples enjoy their mutual pleasures. ॥60॥ At times, they play as pairs of lions, at times as pairs of elephants, at times as pairs of camels, and at times as pairs of boars moving slowly in intoxication. ॥61॥ The couples of cows, horses, and buffaloes also enjoy their lives of the same duration as humans, as per their own will. ॥62॥ The man calls the woman "Arya," and the woman calls the man "Arya." This is the common name for the Bhoga-bhumi (pleasure realm) couples. ॥63॥ There is only one superior birth, and the four castes are not distinct. There is no relationship based on ownership or gender. ॥64॥

## Harivansh Purana

**Verse 104:**
All beings are in the middle path, neither friends nor enemies. Due to their inherently low passions, they all attain the divine realm upon the exhaustion of their lifespan.

**Verse 105:**
A man's death is peaceful with a sneeze, and a woman's with a yawn, when their love for each other is bound by birth.

**Verse 106:**
Then, the Lord of the Ganas, knowing the mind of Shrenik, spoke about the cause of birth in the realm of enjoyment.

**Verse 107:**
Mortals dwelling in the realm of karma, inherently have low passions. They become humans in the realm of enjoyment due to the merit of giving to worthy recipients.

**Verse 108:**
Those purified by right faith, right knowledge, right conduct, and right austerity, and who are impartial towards enemies and friends, are considered the best recipients.

**Verse 109:**
Those who practice restraint and unrestraint are considered average recipients, while those with unwavering right faith and unrestraint are considered the worst.

**Verse 110:**
A wise person, by giving appropriately to all three types of recipients, enjoys the divine pleasures of the realm of enjoyment, having become a human.

**Verse 111:**
Just as a small seed sown properly in fertile land grows, so too does the gift of food and other things given to a worthy recipient.

**Verse 112:**
Just as water in a field of rice and sugarcane becomes sweet, and milk obtained by cows becomes milk, so too does the gift of food, drink, and medicine, even if small and of little taste, become like nectar and everlasting in the next life.

**Verse 113:**
Those who have renounced gross violence, but hold false faith, false knowledge, and false conduct, are considered unworthy recipients. Those who have not renounced gross violence are considered unworthy.

**Verse 114:**
By giving to unworthy recipients, humans become animals in the realms of enjoyment, or are born in low human families and enjoy the inner islands.

**Verse 115:**
Just as a seed sown in barren land yields little fruit, so too does a gift given to an unworthy recipient bring the giver bad fortune.

**Verse 116:**
Just as rice sown in barren land perishes from the root, so too does a gift given to an unworthy recipient become fruitless.

## Seventh Canto

1. Just as water becomes bitter in a neem tree, intoxicating in kodra, and poisonous in the mouth of a serpent, so too, charity given to an unworthy person brings adverse results. || 118 ||
2. Since charity given to a worthy person brings good results, charity given to an unworthy person brings bad results, and charity given to an ineligible person brings sorrow, therefore, one should give charity only to worthy people. || 119 ||
3. Just as a pure crystal becomes fractured due to external influences, so too, the fruit of charity is affected by the nature of the recipient. || 120 ||
4. A person with pure vision, who desires the welfare of others, will attain heaven by giving charity to worthy people. || 121 ||

Then, as the two initial periods of time, which were the cause of happiness, passed, and the third period, equal to one-eighth of the remaining time, was left, and the Kalpa trees, which were previously abundant, began to diminish gradually, the origin of the Kulkaras occurred in this region. O Shrenika! I will now narrate the origin of those Kulkaras, listen attentively. || 122-123 ||

Fourteen Kulkaras were born in succession in the southern part of Bharat, between the great rivers Ganga and Sindhu. || 124 ||

The first among those Kulkaras was Pratiśruti. He was endowed with great influence and was mindful of his past lives. || 125 ||

During his time, the people saw two circular objects, resembling the bells of celestial elephants, in the sky, along with the moon and the sun, on the full moon day. They were terrified and worried about a possible calamity. They gathered together and approached Pratiśruti, seeking refuge. || 126-127 ||

"O King of Men! What are these two unprecedented objects, circular in shape, appearing at the ends of the sky, causing us fear?" || 128 ||

"Alas! This sudden and unbearable fear has befallen us. Has a great calamity, insurmountable for the people, arrived?" || 129 ||

Being asked thus, Pratiśruti said, "O people! Do not fear, nothing is to be feared for us. Be at ease. I will tell you what these are." || 130 ||

"O noble men! This is the sun, surrounded by a halo of light, in the west. And in the east, you see the moon." || 131 ||

In the Harivamsha Purana, the lords of the celestial sphere, the Sun and the Moon, are situated. They are constantly revolving around Mount Meru, their nature being that of revolution. ||132|| Among the four types of gods, the group of Jyotirdeva gods constantly revolves in the sky, following their two lords. ||133|| Their forms were previously covered by the radiance of the great Jyotiranga trees, so they were not visible to the naked eye, except in the Videha region. ||134|| Now, the world is devoid of brilliance due to the fading radiance of the Jyotiranga trees. Therefore, as if desiring to conquer it, the Moon and the Sun are situated with their forms revealed. ||135|| Now, due to the Sun's influence, there will be a distinction between day and night, and due to the Moon's influence, the bright fortnight (Shukla Paksha) and the dark fortnight (Krishna Paksha) will be manifested. ||136|| During the day, the Moon becomes like the setting Sun, not clearly visible, and at night, it attains clarity. This Moon is the companion of the entire celestial sphere. ||137|| You all saw them clearly in the Videha region in your previous birth, so their appearance today is not new to you. ||138|| When a previously seen, heard, and experienced object is seen, there should be no fear of calamity for you. O people, be fearless, abandon the fear of calamity. ||139|| Due to the difference in the nature of time, the nature of things changes, and from that, there is a difference in the behavior of substances, regions, and people. ||140|| Therefore, O people, to eliminate further disorder, three punishments, Ha, Ma, and Dhik, are established. ||141|| If anyone, whether a relative or a stranger, desires to transgress the limits due to a lapse in time, then the three punishments should be applied according to the nature of the offense. ||142|| All people, controlled by the three punishments, remain fearful that their faults may be seen, and due to this fear, they refrain from faults. ||143|| These established punishments should be accepted for the protection of people from calamities and for their welfare. ||144|| Just as the couples reside in their respective palaces, so too, you all should abide by our instructions, remembering them. ||145|| Having said this, the lord of creatures, Prajapati, immediately spoke. Hearing this, the people, full of joy, remained in their respective places. ||146|| And this is the Moon-disc that is visible in the eastern direction. ||131||

The promise made by the Kulankara was accepted by all, and they all happily settled in their respective palaces.

Just as the words of a Guru are accepted, so too were the words of the Kulankara accepted by the people. Therefore, he was known as Pratiśruti on Earth.

This Pratiśruti Kulankara lived for one-tenth of a Palyā, produced a son named Sanmati, and at the end of his life, ascended to heaven.

Sanmati Kulankara protected the traditions of his father, was highly respected by the people, and was a master of many arts. Therefore, he was known as Sanmati.

This Sanmati lived for one-hundredth of a Palyā, produced a son named Kṣemaṅkara, and ascended to heaven.

During his time, the people were afraid of lions and tigers. He brought them peace and prosperity, and therefore, he was known as Kṣemaṅkara.

This lord of the people lived for one-thousandth of a Palyā, produced a son named Kṣemaṇdhara, and ascended to heaven.

This Kṣemaṇdhara protected the traditions of his father and lived for ten thousandth of a Palyā. He produced a son named Sīmaṅkara and ascended to heaven. During his time, the number of Kalpa trees decreased, and the greedy people started fighting amongst themselves. He established boundaries for them, and therefore, he was known by the meaningful name Sīmaṅkara.

This Sīmaṇdhara lived for one-hundred thousandth of a Palyā and ascended to heaven. His son, who was also named Sīmaṇdhara, lived for ten millionth of a Palyā and ascended to heaven.

His son, Vipulavāhana, used to ride large elephants and play on them. Therefore, he was known by the name Vipulavāhana.

This Vipulavāhana lived for one-hundred millionth of a Palyā and ascended to heaven. His son was named Cakṣuṣmān.

Previously, parents used to die without seeing the face and eyes of their children. But during his time, parents started dying after seeing the face and eyes of their children. This caused some fear among the people, but he removed all their fears. Therefore, the people who lived for a longer time called him Cakṣuṣmān.

This Cakṣuṣmān, who was praised by all, lived for one billionth of a Palyā, enjoyed great pleasures, and then ascended to heaven.

Page #182:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, the son of Chakshusman, named Yashasvi, was known for his great fame in his time. He was praised by his people for his prosperity and was called Yashasvi. [16] He lived for a hundred croreth part of the lifespan of the first man, Paly, and after begetting a son named Abhichandra, he ascended to heaven. [16] During his time, people used to play with their children, lifting them up and showing them the moon. Hence, his son was named Abhichandra. [16] Abhichandra, a virtuous man, lived for a thousand croreth part of Paly's lifespan and begot a son named Chandrama, after which he ascended to heaven. [163] Chandrama lived for ten thousand croreth part of Paly's lifespan and begot a son named Marudeva. He nurtured his son for a month before ascending to heaven. [164] During Marudeva's time, children started uttering the words "Mother" and "Father" for the first time. [165] Marudeva, desiring to end the birth of twins, begot only one son named Prasenajit. [166] Before Marudeva, humans did not sweat, but Prasenajit's body was adorned with sweat drops. The valiant Marudeva married his son Prasenajit to a daughter of a prominent family. [167] Marudeva lived for a lakh croreth part of Paly's lifespan and then ascended to heaven. [168] After him, Prasenajit begot a son named Nabhiraj, who lived for a crore years of the previous era, and was known for establishing the practice of cutting the umbilical cord of newborns. He also ascended to heaven. [169] Prasenajit lived for ten lakh croreth part of Paly's lifespan and then ascended to heaven. [170] 

The height of the first man, Pratiśruta, was eighteen hundred dhanus. His son, the second man, Sanmati, was thirteen hundred dhanus tall. The grandson of Pratiśruta, the third man, Kshemaṅkara, was eight hundred dhanus tall. From then on, the height of each subsequent man decreased by twenty-five dhanus. Thus, the height of the last man, Nabhiraj, was five hundred and twenty-five dhanus. [171-172] These fourteen men were all square-shaped. [173]

## Seventh Chapter

The seven glorious ones, **Chakshusman**, **Yashasvi**, and **Prasenajit**, were known for their dark complexion like the Priyangu flower. **Chandrama** was known for his fair complexion like the moon, and the remaining ten were radiant like molten gold.  These fourteen kings were protectors of righteousness, employing the three types of punishments: **Ha**, **Ma**, and **Dhik**. They were like fathers to their subjects and possessed great brilliance.

Thus, I have described the origin of all the **Kulakaras**. Now, O King, listen to the story of **Adi Nath**, the son of **Nabhi Raja**, which destroys all sins.

**The Story of Shikharin**

Though the entire world is filled with six non-artificial substances, it is only through the influence of the divine knowledge of the **Arhat** that the wise have understood it. For the light of the **Jina**, the sun of eternal and prosperous dawn, destroys the dense darkness surrounding the substances like time, in an instant.

Thus ends the seventh chapter of the **Hari Vamsa Purana**, composed by **Jina Sena Acharya**, which describes the origin of time and the **Kulakaras**, from the collection of the **Arishta Nemipuraana**.

The Kalpavriksha-like palace, which had been destroyed in the middle of the southern Bharat, was no more. But the Kalpavriksha-like palace of King Nabhiraj, made of earth, remained. ||2||

That palace, known as Sarvatobhadra, had golden pillars, walls made of various gems, and was adorned with garlands of topaz, coral, and pearls. It had eighty-one sections and was decorated with forts, wells, and gardens. ||3-4||

That ruler, Nabhiraj, by his influence, was alone surrounded by many Kalpavriksha trees and resided in the middle of the earth, in his own place. ||5||

Then, the queen of King Nabhiraj was named Marudevi. She was born in a pure lineage and was as dear to King Nabhiraj as Indrani is to Indra. ||6||

Her two raised feet, with their shining nails, seemed to rise upwards as if desiring to see her forehead. ||7||

Her two feet, with their raised tips, were even, smooth, slender, and with their reddish nails, they produced the beauty of the Kuruvaka on the floor. ||8||

Her finger-like buds were close together, her ankles were hidden, and her feet, like those of a tortoise, were raised, as if floating in a sea of radiance. ||9||

Her feet, marked with beautiful fish and conch shells, were only touched by her husband's touch during play, and were then connected with sweat. ||10||

Her two thighs, with their sequential roundness, devoid of hair and veins, were filled with the essence of beauty, like two quivers of Kamadeva. ||11||

Her two soft knees, with their hidden joints, gave pleasure to her husband's limbs with their soft touch. ||12||

The banana-like pillars, the rough hands of the elephants, even though they had the quality of circumference, were all inferior to her. ||13||

## The Eighth Canto

**14.** Her hips, with their charming, deep-set buttocks, and her broad, strong shoulders, were beyond comparison.

**15.** Her navel, deep and circular like a whirlpool, was adorned with a crown of hair, a source of joy for the king, the lord of the navel.

**16.** Her waist, hairless, slender, and marked by the three folds, seemed to bend under the weight of her round, even, and full breasts.

**17.** Her chest, adorned with the circle of firm breasts, was soft and tender, like a river graced by a pair of playful swans.

**18.** Her hands, with their red palms, were adorned with exquisite bracelets on her wrists and elbows. Her soft arms, like the bonds of love, were a sight to behold.

**19.** Her neck, like the whorls of a conch shell, her lips like coral buds, and her teeth shining like pearls, made her resemble a beautiful sea wave.

**20.** Her tongue, with its red tip, and the interior of her mouth, were radiant. When she spoke, her voice surpassed even the sweet song of the cuckoo.

**21.** Her face, like that of her beloved, was a mirror to the king's desire. Her cheeks, like two mirrors, reflected his gaze.

**22.** Her nose, situated in the middle of her face, was even and symmetrical, as if it were preventing the eyes from seeing each other.

**23.** Her eyes, like three-colored lotuses, were large and long, as if they were seeking counsel from the whispers of the ears.

**24.** Her eyebrows, thin and delicate, were neither too far apart nor too close together. They were auspicious and resembled a drawn bow.

**25.** Her forehead, neither too low nor too high, was beyond the reach of the crescent moon in terms of beauty.

**26.** Her ears, adorned with shining earrings, were plump, soft, and symmetrical. There was no comparison to their beauty.

**13.** The two thighs of the Marudevi were not comparable to the elephant's trunk, which is devoid of essence and hard to the touch, even though they were endowed with qualities of extension.

Harivamsha Purana
She, whose hair was dark blue, soft, and fine, adorned her head with such beauty that it surpassed the path of speech. ||27||
Her face, like the full moon, eclipsed the moon's own radiance, making it appear pale with sorrow. ||28||
The moon, with its sixteen kalas, is devoid of blemishes, while Marudevi possessed seventy-two kalas. How can the moon, with its blemishes, be compared to her radiant form? ||29||
Marudevi possessed sixty-four virtues, while the earth possesses only four. She was supremely soft, while the earth is extremely hard. How can she be compared to the earth? ||30||
Water, though soft and somewhat smooth, is still inert and foolish. Marudevi, however, was supremely soft, filled with love for her husband, and possessed great skill. Water is easily carried by others, while Marudevi was independent. How can she be compared to water? ||31||
Though fire, like Marudevi, is radiant, it is also destructive. How can it be compared to her form? ||32||
Marudevi, through both sight and touch, brought great joy to the king. Air, however, brings joy only through touch. How can she be compared to air? ||33||
Marudevi touched her husband's heart, while space is devoid of touch. How can she be compared to the power of space, even though it is pure? ||34||
Fourteen types of ornaments, created from the Kalpa trees, adorned her limbs, but it was her body that adorned the ornaments, not the other way around. ||35||
If anyone can describe the king's enjoyment of pleasures with Marudevi, which were like those of heaven, then that person would be Shukra or Brihaspati, and no one else. ||36||
Six months before the first Tirthankara, Lord Rishabhadeva, descended from the Sarvarthasiddhi Vimana to be born as King Nabhiraj and Marudevi, a stream of jewels, released by Kubera at the command of Indra, began to fall from the sky onto their courtyard. ||37-38||
Shri, Lakshmi,

## The Eighth Canto

**149**

Having applied obeisance, the delighted celestial maidens, who were to become the parents of the Jina, said, "We have come here from the celestial realm by the command of Indra, and we wish to introduce ourselves." (40)

"O Goddesses! Please give your command, may you be prosperous, and may you live for a long time," said the celestial maidens, with great respect, awaiting the command of Marudevi. (41)

At that time, many celestial maidens, having attained supreme wonder, described the ocean of qualities like form, youth, beauty, and auspiciousness of Marudevi. (42)

Many other celestial maidens praised the skills of Marudevi, which included knowledge of letters, painting, music, mathematics, and scriptures. (43)

Some celestial maidens themselves demonstrated their skills in playing the lute and other instruments. Some sang sweet songs, which were like nectar to the ears. (44)

Some celestial maidens, filled with gestures, expressions, and playful movements, danced gracefully, adorned with the essence of love and other emotions, a delight to the eyes. (45)

Some celestial maidens were eager to hold Marudevi's hands, some to hold her feet, and some to hold other parts of her body. (46)

Some celestial maidens were eager to massage her body with oil, some to apply a paste, some to bathe her, and some to squeeze the water from her bathrobe. (47)

Some celestial maidens were eager to bring fragrant substances, some to apply them, some to arrange colorful garments, and some to dress her. (48)

Some celestial maidens were eager to bring ornaments and garlands, some to adorn her body, some to bring divine food, and some to feed her. (49)

Some celestial maidens were eager to spread out beds and seats, some to offer betel nut, some to keep the spittoon, some to perform household tasks, some to hold the mirror, some to hold the fly whisk, some to hold the umbrella, and some to fan her. (50-51)

Some celestial maidens, holding swords in their hands, were eager to protect her body, and they remained awake, guarding her from planets, demons, and ghosts. (52)

Some celestial maidens stood at the inner door of the house, and some at the outer door, holding swords, discs, maces, weapons, golden staffs, and other weapons. (53)

Dhrti, Kirti, and the other ninety-nine celestial maidens, including Vidutkumari and Dikkumari, arrived from the directions and sub-directions with great fanfare six months earlier. (39)

They came and, with great joy, paid obeisance to the future parents of Jinendra Bhagavan and introduced themselves, saying, "We have come here from the celestial realm by the command of Indra." (40)

"O Goddesses! Please give your command, may you be prosperous, and may you live for a long time," said the celestial maidens, with great respect, awaiting the command of Marudevi. (41)

Having seen the night and day as one, the deities performed their duties. The rule of one's own self is very rare in the world. ||54||
It was also decided that the birth of a Tirthankara would take place in six months, as the earth was being showered with jewels. ||55||
Then, surrounded by beautiful stars, and served by the celestial women, Marudevi, like the moon with its rays, ||56||
lay down in a palace, white like the autumn clouds, fragrant with aguru incense, adorned with various cushions, in a bed fit for a king. ||57||
At the end of the night, she saw auspicious omens, sixteen dreams in sequence, rare to behold. ||58||
First, she saw a white elephant, bearing a stream of mad (intoxication) in its trunk, and its front part, and the bees, the messengers of mad, buzzing around it. The elephant seemed like a king, for just as the hands of a king, the lotus-hands, are wet with the stream of water taken for the purpose of great giving, so the trunk and nostrils of the elephant were wet with the stream of mad-water, and just as the messengers of giving stand near the king and praise him, so the bees, the messengers of mad, were buzzing near him. ||59||
Secondly, she saw a bull, bearing a noble form, a brave, strong bull. The bull seemed like Dharma, for just as Dharma defeats the solitary opponents with his sweet teachings, so the bull was defeating the opponent bulls with his roaring sound, just as Dharma gives auspicious rise, so the bull was the one who indicated auspicious rise, just as Dharma is of noble form, auspicious, so he was the one who bore a noble form, excellent form, just as Dharma inspires courage, wisdom, so the bull was also courageous, deep. And just as Dharma is elevated, excellent, so the bull was also elevated, high. ||60||
Thirdly, she saw a lion with sharp claws, fangs, and mane. The lion seemed as if he was ready to search for the scent of the mad of the elephant seen in the first dream. ||61||
Fourthly, she saw the anointing of Lakshmi, seated on a lotus, by intoxicated elephants, with a great sound of various jeweled pitchers. The anointing of Lakshmi seemed as if the clouds, marked by the rainbow and roaring loudly, were anointing the earth with new water. ||62||
Fifthly, she saw a forest full of various flowers, and very fragrant, with a long garland of flowers, and surrounded by all the goddesses, eager to serve. ||63||
A mace, a spear, and a golden staff were in her hand. ||53||
Thus, seeing the fulfillment of her own command by the goddesses, who were rare in the world for others, and the continuous shower of jewels for six months, King Nabhiraj and Marudevi decided that the birth of a Tirthankara, worthy of being prayed to by all, would take place in their home. ||54-55||
Then, surrounded by beautiful stars, and served by the celestial women, Marudevi, like the moon with its rays, ||56||
lay down in a palace, white like the autumn clouds, fragrant with aguru incense, adorned with various cushions, in a bed fit for a king. ||57||

## The Eighth Canto

**151** Below, a canopy of rays, a staff of sunbeams, a shield against the heat. The dark orb of the moon, adorned with stars, like a jewel. ||64||

**152** The evening sky, tinged with the red of the setting sun, a crimson hue on its limbs. The rising sun, like a pot of vermilion, lifted for auspiciousness. ||65||

**153** Two fish, playing in the water, their bellies adorned with beauty, their eyes, like playful glances, come to greet the goddess. ||66||

**154** Two large, golden pitchers, filled with water, like the breasts of a mother, bearing the weight of her child, a sight to behold. ||67||

**155** A lake, like a mighty army, with a canopy of white lotuses, their stalks like staffs, adorned with beautiful swans, their cries like the rumble of chariots. ||68||

**156** The sky, filled with constellations, like the vast ocean, teeming with fish, couples of fish, leaping and diving, and a multitude of crocodiles and other creatures. ||69||

**157** A golden throne, supported by strong, lion-like figures, with keen eyes and faces turned upwards, like the world held by the strong arms of the kings of men. ||70||

**158** A celestial chariot, brought down to earth by celestial maidens, singing beautiful songs, to show men the beauty of heaven. ||71||

**63** She saw large, fragrant garlands. They seemed as if all the seasons' wealth had come together to serve the goddess of the winds, and had been woven into these garlands and lifted up. ||63||

**64** For the sixth time, she saw the moon. It seemed as if the night, like a woman, had raised a canopy above her head, adorned with stars like jewels, and the rays of the moon, falling downwards, served as a staff. ||64||

**65** For the seventh time, she saw the rising sun, with the red of the evening sky on its limbs. It seemed as if the woman of the east had lifted a pot of vermilion, for auspiciousness. ||65||

**66** For the eighth time, she saw two fish playing in the water. They seemed as if they had come to the goddess, to show off the beauty of their bellies and the playfulness of their eyes. ||66||

**67** For the ninth time, she saw two large, golden pitchers, filled with water. They seemed as if they had been lifted up to behold the breasts of their mother, who bore them. ||67||

**68** For the tenth time, she saw a lake, which seemed like a mighty army. Just as an army is adorned with a canopy of white lotuses, their stalks like staffs, and beautiful swans, their cries like the rumble of chariots, so was this lake. ||68||

**69** For the eleventh time, she saw a vast ocean, growing larger, which seemed like the sky itself. Just as the sky is filled with constellations, like fish, couples of fish, leaping and diving, and a multitude of crocodiles and other creatures, so was this ocean. ||69||

**70** For the twelfth time, she saw a golden throne. Just as the world is held by the strong arms of the kings of men, so was this throne held by strong, lion-like figures, with keen eyes and faces turned upwards. ||70||

**71** For the thirteenth time, she saw a celestial chariot. It seemed as if celestial maidens, singing beautiful songs, had brought it down to earth, to show men the beauty of heaven. ||71||

## Chapter 152

Having conquered the Nagaloka, the Nagendra's abode was filled with glory.  Driven by a desire to conquer the Seshaloka, the Nagakanyas brought him to earth.  (72)

He saw a mass of great jewels in the sky, creating a brilliant display of lightning and rainbows, even though there were no clouds. (73)

Then he saw a very pure and swirling flame, a smokeless fire, like a grove of Palasha trees with their branches full of vibrant flowers. (74)

Having seen these sixteen distinct dreams, Queen Marudevi then held the Jina within her, who had entered her through the mouth in the form of a bull. (75)

"I have brought my mistress the new joy of seeing auspicious dreams, so I am fulfilled," said the sleep-like companion, and disappeared. (76)

"Awake, O Mother, who knows all things! Grow, O Mother, who is the embodiment of growth! Conquer, O Mother, who is the mistress of victory! Be fulfilled in all your desires!"  These words, spoken by the Dikkumari, were only auspicious for the awakened one. (77-78)

"O Mother, this moon, the devourer of darkness, is stained with blemishes.  Seeing your flawless and virtuous face, it is ashamed and loses its brilliance." (79)

"Your radiance illuminates this house, so these lamps are laughing at themselves, pretending to shine." (80)

"O Mother, this morning twilight, like the friendship of the wicked, is fading.  Just as the friendship of the wicked is initially full of passion, but soon turns to flattery of enemies, so this morning twilight was initially full of passion, but is now fading.  Just as the friendship of the wicked is barren and fruitless, so this morning twilight is barren and cannot bring about any accomplishment." (81)

"And the rising sun, like the friendship of the virtuous, is growing stronger.  Just as the friendship of the virtuous is initially weak due to envy, but later expands greatly." (82)

## The Eighth Canto

**153** The sky, adorned with the radiant sun, is itself its own auspicious mark. Like a beautiful woman, the dawn has risen for your good fortune. 

**8** Having spent a long night in the pools, the swan, pleased, is now making its melodious calls. 

**8** The flock of swans, eager to see the play of your feet, is calling out, as if to wake you. 

**45** The trees, warmed by the gentle breeze, seem to be showing you the beginning of their dance. 

**86** The directions are all serene, as if they are imitating your movements. Good morning, Goddess, leave your bed, O blameless one! 

**87** Thus praised by her attendants, she, with her pure form, left her bed, like a swan leaving the sandy shore for the waves of flowers. 

**88** Taking up her washed clothes, she emerged, radiant as the moon's crescent in the autumn clouds. 

**89** Adorned with new ornaments by the Viddyutkumari and Dikkumari goddesses, she went towards the mountain of the navel, like a cloud pregnant with rain. 

**10** She, who resembled Lakshmi in her beauty, sat on her seat, and with folded hands, began to relate her dreams to the king, who was seated on his auspicious seat. 

**11** Understanding the meaning of the dreams, the king, Nabhiraj, said to his beloved, "Surely, today, the Lord of the three worlds, the Tirthankara, has taken birth in your womb." 

**12** Such dreams are not seen when the fruit is distant or small. Therefore, I am certain that today, your womb has been blessed. 

**13** The continuous rain of jewels for six months, and the service of the gods, have indicated the birth of a Jina, and today, that fruit has ripened for us. 

**14** Just as the sun's rays are initially faint and then spread widely, encompassing everything, so too is the friendship of a good person meaningful, just as the sun's rays are meaningful. 

**82**

Page #192:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana,
It is said that the son born to the one who is the object of all auspiciousness, O beloved! will surely bring joy to the world very soon. || 95 ||
Hearing the fruit of this auspicious dream, the queen Marudevi, adorned with radiance and beauty, was overjoyed. || 96 ||
In the third time cycle, eighty-four lakhs of years ago, when three years and eight and a half months remained, on the second day of the dark fortnight of Ashadha, in the Uttaraashada constellation, the Lord Jinendra, worshipped by the entire world, descended from heaven. || 97-98 ||
As the fetus grew in the womb, the mother's body also grew, but due to the fear that the beauty of the Trivalika might be lost, it seemed as if her belly did not grow. || 99 ||
The queen Marudevi herself was adorned with great glory, and she was bearing the Lord Jinendra, the Guru of the three worlds, who was heavy (superior in all aspects). Yet, she felt extremely light in her body, which was a great wonder. || 100 ||
Knowing that I should not be the cause of my mother's suffering while remaining in the womb, the Jinendra child remained very still in the womb. His dwelling in the mother's womb was like that of the sun reflected in water. || 101 ||
Seeing the world with the three eyes of knowledge, namely, Mati, Shruta, and Avadhi, the Jinendra child remained comfortably in the womb for nine months, purified by the Dik Kumaris. || 102 ||
After those nine months were complete, when there was a continuous shower of jewels, the mother gave birth to the Jinendra child in the Uttaraashada constellation. || 103 ||
Just as the sun, emerging from the midst of a cloud mass, shines brightly in the pure eastern direction, like a pure crystal, so too did the Jinendra child, emerging from the pure womb of the queen Marudevi, like a crystal, shine brightly. || 104 ||
At that time, the goddesses who were present there immediately engaged in the necessary birth rituals. It is only right, for those who are close to the inner circle quickly engage in their duties in the world. || 105 ||
With their cheeks adorned by the radiance of their swaying earrings, the eight Dik Kumari goddesses, namely, 1. Vijaya, 2. Vaijayanti, 3. Jayanti, 4. Aparajita, 5. Nanda, 6. Nandottara, 7. Nandi, and 8. Nandivardhana, stood there, holding cymbals in their hands. || 106-107 ||
Adorned with various ornaments, 1. Susthita, 2. Pranidhanaya, 3. Suprabuddha, 4. Yashodhara, 5. Lakshmimati, 6. Kirtimati, 7. Vasundhara,

Page #193:

## The Eighth Canto

Eight Dikkumari goddesses, Citra and Citramaranabhasvara, stood with mirrors in their hands.  

1. Ila, 2. Sura, 3. Prithvi, 4. Padmavati, 5. Kanchana, 6. Sita, 7. Navamika, and 8. Bhadraka, these eight Dikkumari goddesses, adorned with the brilliance of their superior bodies, illuminating the directions, stood in wonder, holding white umbrellas.

1. Hri, 2. Sri, 3. Dhriti, 4. Varuni, 5. Pundarikani, 6. Alambusa, 7. Ambujasyasri, and 8. Mishrakeśi, these eight Dikkumari goddesses, adorned with shining golden earrings, stood holding fly whisks with golden staffs.

1. Citra, 2. Kanakacitra, 3. Sutraman, and 4. Trishira, these four Vidutkumari goddesses, illuminated everything with their brilliance like lightning.

1. Vijaya, 2. Vaijayanti, 3. Jayanti, and 4. Aparajita, these four goddesses were the chief among the Vidutkumari goddesses.

1. Rucaka, 2. Rucakojvala, 3. Rucakabha, and 4. Rucakprabha, these four goddesses were the chief among the Dikkumari goddesses.

These eight goddesses performed the Jatakarma of the Jina according to the prescribed rituals. They are highly skilled in Jatakarma and perform it for the Jina everywhere.

At that time, the crowns of all the Indras in the three worlds became unsteady, and their seats trembled due to the influence of the Jina's birth.

The Ahmindras, who possessed the knowledge of the future, remained in their respective abodes. They merely took seven steps from their thrones and offered a silent obeisance to the Jina.

In the realm of the Bhavanavasi Devas, the sound of conch shells arose spontaneously. In the realm of the Vyantaras, the sound of drums echoed. And in the realm of the Jyotishis, the roar of lions resounded.

The resounding sound of the great bells of precious stones filled the realm of the Kalpavasis. At that time, the three worlds were filled with anxiety, wondering what to do.

Saudharmendra, whose mind was bewildered by the trembling of the seat, shook his crown and raised his head, pondering: "This newborn child, foolish, independent, acting impulsively, fearless, and without any doubt, who is this who has performed this?"

Page #194:
---------------------------
156
In the Harivamsha Purana, the group of gods and demons, who are all powerful in their own right, are described.  Even if they become hostile, the one who is capable of destroying them is Indra, the king of gods, the mighty one, the Purandara. Why then, does this fool not recognize me? He is shaking my unshakeable throne. 124-125
I do not consider anyone in the three worlds to be as powerful as the Tirthankara.  With this thought, he took refuge in the knowledge of the future. 126
Then, with his eyes of knowledge of the future, he saw the first Tirthankara born in the land of Bharat. 127
He quickly descended from his throne, took seven steps forward, and said, "Victory to the Jina!" He bowed with folded hands. 128
Then, he ascended his throne and ordered his commander-in-chief, who was standing before him with folded hands, "The first Tirthankara of this descending time cycle has been born.  All the gods must go to the land of Bharat.  You must inform everyone." 129-130
Upon hearing the order of his master, the commander-in-chief, along with all the gods residing in the Saudharma heaven, and all the Indras up to the Acyuta heaven, went out to spread the news. 131
Those who had received the news of the birth of the Tirthankara through their own auspicious signs, were filled with joy.  The Jyotishis, Vyantaras, and Bhavanavasis, all emerged from their respective abodes. 132
At that time, the sky was filled with seven types of armies: 1 elephant, 2 horses, 3 chariots, 4 foot soldiers, 5 bulls, 6 Gandharvas, and 7 dancers. 133
The Asura Kumaras and other ten types of Bhavanavasis, with their buffaloes, boats, rhinoceroses, elephants, Garuda, palanquins, horses, camels, crocodiles, elephants, and swans, filled the sky with their seven types of armies.  The sky was adorned with their splendor. 134-135
Some of the gods were riding in vimanas, some on bulls, some on donkeys, some in chariots, some on horses, some on octopuses and lions, some on crocodiles, some on camels, some on boars and buffaloes, some on lions, some on deer, some on cheetahs, some on elephants, some on Suragayas. 136

157. Upon many deer, many black deer, many Garuda, many parrots, many cuckoos, many cranes, many kūrara, many peacocks and chickens, many pigeons, swans, karaṇḍava and sārasa, many groups of cakravāka and balāka, and many herons and other creatures, the four divisions of the gods were moving about. ||138-139||
With white umbrellas, various kinds of flags, and white camaras like foam, the four divisions of the gods were filling the entire sky as they moved about. ||140||
The sound of drums, kettledrums, and conch shells filled the entire world, and the wonderful arrival of the gods was adorned with dancing and singing. ||141||
At that time, Saudharma Indra was riding on the elephant Airavata, the lord of the army of elephants, whose body was like the sky. ||142||
That Airavata had his trunk extended between his tusks, and the serpent king was rising up between the bamboo goads, so he appeared like a mountain. ||143||
He appeared just like the sky, for just as the sky is filled with balāka, swans, and lightning, so too was that elephant adorned with ears, camaras, conch shells, and a garland of stars hanging from his neck. ||144||
Saudharma Indra, along with the group of Indras riding on other elephant kings, arrived at the sacred birthplace of the Jina, along with all the gods. ||145||
That line of gods and asuras descending from the sky saw the city built by Kubera on earth as if it were heaven itself. ||146||
That city was beautiful with its ramparts, walls, and moats, and it was adorned with gardens, forests, pleasure grounds, lakes, and pools. ||147||
The walls were made of Indra-nīla, mahānīla, diamond, and vaidūrya gems, and the palaces were adorned with the brilliance of padmarāga and other gems. ||148||
The minds of the gods and asuras who saw the beauty of that city were freed from their longing to see the beauty of heaven and hell. ||149||
Because the three worlds of gods, asuras, and humans had all arrived there together, that glorious city was known from that time as "Sāketa." ||150||

After that, Saudharmendra, having circumambulated the city thrice with the Devas, entered the city and ordered Sachi, the pure one, to bring the Jina. ||151||
Having received the order from her mother, Sachi entered the delivery room and, using divine illusion, put the mother to sleep and placed another illusory child beside her. ||152||
Then, after prostrating, she took the Jina child and placed him in Indra's hands. Indra, with his thousand eyes, saw the child's extraordinary beauty, yet he was not satisfied. ||153||
With the Jina child in his lap, seated on the elephant Airavata, Saudharmendra was adorned as if he were the peak of Mount Nishadha, along with the rising sun. ||154||
Saudharmendra, with the Jina child covered by a canopy-like garment and surrounded by groups of whisks, took him to the peak of Mount Meru with the Devas. ||155||
Indra, first circumambulating Mount Meru with the Devas, then placed the Jina child on the throne situated on the Panduka rock. ||156||
At that time, the Devas played the deep-sounding drums, kettledrums, mridangas, and other instruments, as well as blew conch shells, all resounding like the ocean in turmoil. ||157||
The Kinnaras, Gandharvas, Tumburu, Narada, and all the Devas of the Visvavasu clan, along with their wives, sang various songs that captivated the ears and hearts. ||158||
At that time, the Devas played the four melodious instruments: Tata, Vitata, Dhana, and Sushira. ||159||
The Apsaras danced, their movements graceful, adorned with ornaments, and filled with wonder-inspiring emotions like love and beauty. ||160||
Thus, while the Devas were celebrating with great joy, the Meru mountain, with its long and wide caves, echoed with their voices, and Saudharmendra, filled with joy, was adorned for the coronation ceremony, while the beautiful celestial women, with their auspicious hands, were ready to perform the auspicious rituals. ||161||
With the Devas gathered in groups, with great speed and wealth, they spread in all directions, causing the ocean of milk to churn. ||163||

## The Eighth Canto

**159** Filled with milk, the celestial beings tossed the pitchers from hand to hand. They shone like gold, like the Meru mountains, like the moon and the sun. **164** With the continuous roar of the pitchers, thousands of gods performed the birth-abhisheka of the Jina with milk. **165** The Indra-like pitchers, the great clouds, rained milk, but the Jina-child, the mountain of compassion, was not even slightly troubled. **166** Propelled by the waves of milk, tossed by the Jina's breath, the gods floated for a moment like a swarm of flies in the ocean of milk. **167** The assembly of gods had previously seen Meru adorned with jewels, but now it appeared white, bathed in the milk-ocean. **168** Though the ocean of milk was extremely remote, the assembly of gods made it manifest for the birth-abhisheka of the Jina. **169** Meru was the seat of the bath, the ocean of milk was the water of the bath, and the gods were the bathers. This was the bath of the Jina. **170** Indra, the Samanikas, the Lokapalas, and other celestial beings performed the abhisheka of the Jina with the water of the milk-ocean in due order. **171** The celestial women, led by Sachi, with hands as soft as tender leaves, gently rubbed the Jina-child, who had hands as soft as tender leaves, with fragrant ointments that attracted swarms of bees. Thus, they experienced the new joy of touching the Jina-child. **172-173** Then, like the rain-season, burdened by the weight of the clouds, which anoints the mountains, the celestial women, burdened by the weight of their milk-filled breasts, anointed the Jina with pitchers filled with fragrant water. **174** The Jina-child, who possessed a perfectly square form and whose body was strong due to the accumulation of vajra-like strength, had his ears, which were as strong as vajra, pierced by the tip of a vajra-needle. **175-176** Then, the two earrings worn in his ears made him shine like Jambudvipa, adorned by two suns, his constant attendants. **177**

In the Harivamsha Purana, a Padma raga gem was placed on his head, like a Hari nila gem. ||17|| A white sandalwood paste was placed on his forehead, shining like the crescent moon in the evening sky. ||179|| His arms, adorned with golden armlets studded with divine gems, looked like young snakes with gem-studded hoods. ||180|| His wrists, adorned with the brilliance of the finest ruby bracelets, resembled the shores of a mountain of gems, inhabited by gods. ||181|| His chest, adorned with a beautiful garland of large pearls, shone like the beautiful shore of a mountain, adorned by a waterfall. ||182|| He shone with a garland of glittering gems, like a Kalpa tree adorned with a beautiful Kalpa vine. ||183|| His waist, adorned with a colorful belt, shone like the shore of a mountain, illuminated by lightning in the clouds. ||184|| His feet, adorned with gem-studded anklets, seemed to be engaged in a conversation with each other. ||185|| He was adorned with gem-studded golden rings, as if to protect his beauty, which was overflowing from his limbs. ||186|| He was anointed with sandalwood paste and adorned with saffron tilak, shining like a crystal mountain, adorned with the evening clouds. ||187|| He was adorned with a pure, white, swan-like shawl, shining like a clear autumn sky. ||188|| He was adorned with a garland of flowers, made by skilled celestial nymphs, from the trees of the celestial realm, such as the Santan, Parijat, and others, as well as various fragrant flowers from the water and land, and flowers from the forests of Bhadrashala, Nandana, Saumanasa, and Panduka. ||189|| 
The Lord's head was adorned with a blue, smooth, Padma raga gem, which shone as if it were a Hari nila gem. ||178|| The Lord's forehead was adorned with a white sandalwood paste, which shone like the crescent moon in the evening sky. ||179|| His two soft arms, adorned with golden armlets studded with divine gems, looked like young snakes with gem-studded hoods. ||180|| His two wrists, adorned with the brilliance of the finest ruby bracelets, resembled the shores of a mountain of gems, inhabited by gods. ||181|| His chest, adorned with a beautiful garland of large pearls, shone like the beautiful shore of a mountain, adorned by a waterfall. ||182|| He shone with a garland of glittering gems, like a Kalpa tree adorned with a beautiful Kalpa vine. ||183|| His waist, adorned with a colorful belt, shone like the shore of a mountain, illuminated by lightning in the clouds. ||184|| His two feet, adorned with gem-studded anklets, seemed to be engaged in a conversation with each other. ||185|| He was adorned with gem-studded golden rings, as if to protect his beauty, which was overflowing from his limbs. ||186|| He was anointed with sandalwood paste and adorned with saffron tilak, shining like a crystal mountain, adorned with the evening clouds. ||187|| He was adorned with a pure, white, swan-like shawl, shining like a clear autumn sky. ||188|| He was adorned with a garland of flowers, made by skilled celestial nymphs, from the trees of the celestial realm, such as the Santan, Parijat, and others, as well as various fragrant flowers from the water and land, and flowers from the forests of Bhadrashala, Nandana, Saumanasa, and Panduka. ||189||

**161**

Adorned by celestial women with garlands, he was resplendent. His head was adorned with a crown, a mountain of ornaments. **19**

He was Bhadrashala, the delight of the world, the joy of all beings. He was Nandana, the embodiment of happiness, and Saumanasa, the possessor of a noble heart. He was Panduka, his own glory making him white as the Panduka flower. **19**

He was the supreme lord of the three worlds, the one who was adorned with special marks. He was especially adorned with the marks of the gods, in the forest. **193**

Though the child was free from the stain of sin, his eyes were adorned with the finest kohl. They shone with a brilliance that surpassed the sun and moon. **194**

Sri, Shachi, Kirti, and Lakshmi, the celestial goddesses, adorned him with their own hands. They captivated the hearts of Indra and the other gods. **195**

Then, the gods, led by Indra, called him Rishabha, the chief of men, and prepared to praise him. **196**

O Rishabha, you possess the supreme vision of wisdom, knowledge, and understanding. Though born in the land of Bharata, you have illuminated the three worlds. **197**

O Lord, even when you were about to descend into the human realm, you subdued the world with wondrous deeds like the rain of jewels. Now that you have been born as a human, what is there to wonder at? **198**

You have placed the mighty Mount Meru, with its towering peak, beneath your feet. You are the supreme teacher of all lords, and even in your childhood, you do not behave like a child. **199**

The celestial mountains, who in their pride never touch the earth, now bear your feet on their lofty peaks. Is this the power of your mantras, or your divine power, or your inspiring power, or some other great wonder? **200-201**

O Lord, you have subdued the three worlds with your unparalleled strength. How is it that you, like the creator himself, can hold the entire universe in a single step? **202**

Page #200:

## Chapter 162

**162**

Where is this delicacy, and where is such harshness? O Lord, in you, the possibility of contradictory things is seen. ||203||

Your form, adorned with eight thousand and eight characteristics and embellishments, is extremely beautiful, rare even for humans, gods, and demons. ||204||

O Lord, you are the first and the last in the world due to your extraordinary form. You subdue the entire universe without any battle. ||205||

O Lord, when you were in the womb, a rain of gold was showered upon everyone. Therefore, the gods call you Hiranyagarbha (he who has gold in his womb). ||206||

O Lord, you were born here with the three knowledges that manifested in the third existence. Therefore, you are called Swayambhu (self-born). ||207||

You will be the creator of various systems in the Bharat region. Therefore, you are called Vidhata (creator) with this meaningful name. ||208||

O Lord, you were born as the protector of all, unprecedented, and the master. Therefore, you are called Prajapati (lord of creatures). ||209||

O Lord, in your presence, the people will enjoy sugarcane juice with great joy. Therefore, you are called Ikshvaku. ||210||

You are the first among all the ancient sages, the possessor of great glory, great yourself, and shining brightly here. Therefore, you are called Purudeva. ||211||

O Lord, you have attained the glory of the three worlds by sitting on the throne of the Bharatas. This is a trivial matter for you, the possessor of infinite wealth. ||212||

O Lord, you are self-enlightened, the performer of extremely difficult austerities, and the knower of supreme knowledge and immense fame. ||213||

O Lord, you will be a wise and valiant sage on earth, showing the excellence of charity and righteousness for the sake of creatures, and your own pure character. ||214||

The mantra of the serpent of desire, which is the cause of the destruction of the enemies of the gods, is the cause of delusion, the cause of the fall from the cloud of delusion. ||215||

**216.**  He is like a vast ocean, calm and serene, where fish sleep peacefully, having attained the state of *Samvara* (spiritual restraint) after the cessation of karmic bonds. He is like fire, consuming the fuel of karmic actions, leading to liberation.

**217.**  He is the light of the path to liberation, illuminating all, independent of any external support. He is naturally the teacher of the path to liberation in this world.

**218.**  In this land of Bharat, where the name of Dharma (righteousness) has been eradicated for eighteen *koti-koti* (billions) of oceans of time, he will re-establish it.

**219.**  He is the wise teacher, guiding the souls seeking liberation from the cycle of birth and death, who are blinded by the illusions of the world.

**220.**  Through his teachings, the noble souls will become the masters of heavenly wealth and the refuge of liberation wealth in this world.

**221.**  Following the path he has shown, which is in harmony with the principles of *Pramana* (proof) and *Nay* (logic), beings will attain their desired destination.

**222.**  He is worthy of being worshipped, praised, and remembered by all who seek their own good, for he is the benefactor of all beings.

**223.**  By bowing to him, the body of the devotee becomes fulfilled, by praising his virtues, his speech becomes meaningful, and by meditating on him, his mind becomes filled with virtues.

**224.**  Salutations to you, O conqueror of death! Salutations to you, O destroyer of the cycle of birth and death! Salutations to you, O ender of old age! Salutations to you, O destroyer of karmic actions!

**225.**  Salutations to you, O possessor of infinite knowledge! Salutations to you, O seer of the infinite! Salutations to you, O possessor of infinite strength! Salutations to you, O possessor of infinite bliss!

**226.**  Salutations to you, O lord of the worlds! Salutations to you, O friend of all beings! Salutations to you, O hero of the worlds! Salutations to you, O protector of the worlds!

**215.**  There are mantras to control, ankushas (goads) to subdue the elephant of hatred, and powerful winds to dispel the clouds of delusion.

**Note:** The translation uses the Jain terms *Samvara*, *Pramana*, and *Nay* to preserve the original meaning.

Salutations to the Jina, the Moon, salutations to the Jina, the Sun. Salutations to the Jina, the benefactor of all, salutations to the Jina, the protector of all. ||227|| Having praised and saluted with hundreds of hymns, Indra and the other gods repeatedly requested, "O Lord, may our supreme devotion always remain in you." ||228|| 
Then, surrounded by a swift-moving army of gods, Indra, with the Jina child, set out from Mount Meru. ||229|| Placing the Jina child, whose body was the color of gold and whose form was like a heap of golden and pomegranate flowers, on the moving silver mountain, Airavata, he set out for Ayodhya. ||230|| 
He arrived in Ayodhya, which was the Ayodhya of enemies, adorned with rows of flags, filled with the sound of trumpets, and which seemed like its own army. There, he placed the Jina child in the lap of his mother, Indrani. Then, saluting his parents, he quickly donned beautiful attire and began to perform the Tandava dance. At that time, Indra was surrounded by a beautiful forest of dancing devanganas, and at the very beginning of the Tandava dance, he caused the earth to tremble. ||231-233|| 
The Lord's parents were spectators of this dance. After performing the play of joy for a long time in front of them and honoring them appropriately, Indra went to his own place with the gods. ||234|| 
Fifteen months before the birth of the Jina, three and a half crore jewels rained down from the sky every day on his father's house. ||235|| 
Knowing that "Our son has been crowned on Mount Meru by the assembly of Indras and is the lord of the three worlds," King Nabhiraj and Marudevi, who were extremely generous, were filled with great joy. ||236|| 
Salutations to you, you are the unparalleled hero in the world, therefore salutations to you. You are the creator of the world, therefore salutations to you. ||226|| 
O Jina, you are like the moon, therefore salutations to you. O Jina, you are like the sun, therefore salutations to you. O Jina, you are the benefactor of all, therefore salutations to you. O Jina, you are the protector of all, therefore salutations to you. ||227||

This description of the **svārgāvatāra** and **janmābhiṣeka** of **Vṛṣabha** is auspicious. He who reads it with devotion, or who hears it, attains the auspiciousness of the **Jina-sun**. ||237||

Thus ends the eighth canto of the **Harivaṃśa** composed by **Jinaseṇācārya**, which is a collection of the **Ariṣṭanemi Purāṇa**, and which describes the **janmābhiṣeka** of **Ṛṣabha** ||8||

The Ninth Chapter:  

1. Drinking the nectar placed on the thumb by Indra, and distributing nectar-like food to his parents' eyes, the Jina grew day by day. 
2. The ocean of joy of the world increased every day at the sight of the Jina-child, like a young moon with cool rays. 
3. Although the nectar of the child's play was constantly drunk and easily available, it was not enough to satisfy the eyes of men. (Meaning: Men's eyes were not satisfied by watching the Jina's child's play.)
4. The Jina-child, guided by Indra, played delightful games with divine children who were benevolent and looked like his own reflections. 
5. His soft bed, soft seat, clothes, ornaments, unguents, food, vehicle, and chariot were all divinely made. 
6. Dhanada-Kubera, who served the Jina with devotion, according to Indra's command and the season, was truly a giver of wealth. 
7. Filled with youth, the Jina, adorned with divine qualities like his own natural friends, shone like the moon. 
8. His broad shoulders were adorned with a high crest, his arms were round and well-proportioned, and his wrists were excellent. His two great arms were sufficient to embrace the wealth of the three worlds. 
9. The Lord's broad chest was adorned with the Srivatsa mark, as if it were oppressed by the tip of the breast of the well-embraced goddess of fortune. 
10. His feet and shanks were well-joined, his knees were hidden within the muscles, and his thighs, like the supporting pillars of a palace, were very beautiful. 
11. The cluster of black curly hair on his umbrella-shaped head looked like a cluster of Indra-nila gems on the high peak of Sumeru. 
12. His forehead, nose, the stalks of the blue lotuses on his beautiful ears, and his eyebrows like a bow with a string, all surpassed description.

The moon with its moonlight brings joy to the world at night, and the sun with its brilliance brings joy during the day. But the face of the Lord brought joy to all, day and night, without distinction. He was neither like the moon nor the sun. ||33||

His eyes were like lotus petals, his ears were long, and his hands, feet, and lips were the color of red lac. ||14||

His teeth, like a cluster of pure pearls, were perfectly aligned and shone with the brilliance of the kunda flower. ||15||

His body, with its nine hundred adornments and one hundred and eight auspicious marks, was five hundred bows tall and resembled Mount Meru. Even a hundred crore Indras could not describe his beauty, even in the slightest. ||16-17||

When the Lord reached the prime of his youth, he was married to the two peerless beauties, Nanda and Sunanda, both in the prime of their youth. He played with them, following all the proper rituals. ||18||

The Lord appeared like the Kalpavriksha (wish-fulfilling tree) of the world, standing between Nanda and Sunanda, who were like two creepers clinging to his body. They both had beautiful, full breasts. ||19||

There was no such beauty, brilliance, wealth, or art in the world that was not possessed by the Lord Rishabhadeva and Nanda and Sunanda. What then can be said of their happiness? ||20||

Nanda gave birth to a son named Bharat, who brought joy to the land of Bharat, and a daughter named Brahmi. ||21||

Sunanda, the other queen, gave birth to a son named Bahubali, who was strong and powerful, and a daughter named Sundari, who was extremely beautiful. ||22||

Besides Bharat and Brahmi, Sunanda had eighty-nine other sons, starting with Vrishabhasena. All of them were perfect beings. ||23||

The Lord, with his great wisdom, initiated all his sons and daughters, including Brahmi and Sundari, into the ocean of knowledge, which included letters, painting, music, and mathematics. In other words, he made all his children proficient in various arts. ||24||

Page #206:

168
Then, at another time, all the people, afflicted with great misery, inspired by King Nabhiraj, came together to Lord Vrishabhadeva and, after offering salutations with praise, said: ||25|| O Lord! In the past, Kalpa trees were the means of livelihood for the people. Then, when they perished, sugarcane plants, which themselves were dripping with juice, became the means. ||26|| O Lord of the people! The people were so satisfied with the juice of those divine sugarcane plants, and you protected them with your power, that they forgot the Kalpa trees altogether. ||27|| But now, even though those sugarcane plants are broken and shattered, they do not yield juice, and they are hard because of the passage of time. ||28|| Although various types of grass are seen bending under the weight of their fruits, we do not know how food can be obtained from them. ||29|| Tell us, is the liquid that is dripping from the breasts of cows and buffaloes, which are large like pots, edible or inedible? ||30|| O Lord! Lions, tigers, and wolves, who were once fit for embracing, are now frightening us like wicked sons. ||31|| Therefore, O Lord! Please grace this people, who are afflicted by the pangs of hunger, by showing them the means of livelihood and protecting them from fear. ||32|| Then, seeing the people afflicted by hunger, the compassionate Lord first relieved their suffering by providing divine food, and then, for the sake of their livelihood, he taught them all the means, as well as the means of Dharma, Artha, and Kama. ||33-34|| He taught them the six actions, namely, Ashi, Mashi, Krishi, Vidya, Vanijya, and Shilpa, along with many other means for the attainment of happiness. ||35|| Then, he also said that they should collect and protect cows, buffaloes, and other animals, and abandon wicked creatures like lions. ||36|| Then, the Lord's hundred sons and the people learned the arts and sciences, and the people made hundreds of artisans and adopted them. ||37|| As a result, the artisans created villages, towns, and fields, as well as carts and wagons, all over the earth. ||38|| At that time, the three varnas, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shudra, also arose. The Kshatriya arose because of the protection of beings from destruction, the Vaishya arose because of commerce, and the Shudra arose because of their connection with the arts and crafts. ||39||

**169**

**40.** The people, having attained true happiness through the six karmas, were extremely pleased and declared that era as the Krita Yuga.

**41.** Indra and the other gods, having arrived, performed the coronation of Lord Rishabhadeva and bestowed upon the people the greatest prosperity.

**42.** Ayodhya, filled with virtuous people, Vinita, and Saketa, renowned for its sanctity, were all flourishing at that time.

**43.** Lord Rishabhadeva, the friend of the world, appointed those who were the eldest and knowledgeable in the lineage of the Ikshvaku Kshatriyas to protect the land.

**44.** The rulers of the Kuru country were called Kuru, their rule was strict, and those who ruled justly and protected the people were called Bhoj.

**45.** Besides these, many other kings were established who delighted the people. At that time, the land was adorned by the Kuru princes, such as Shreyans, Soma Prabha, and others.

**46.** After that, eighty-three lakhs of years passed from the birth of the Lord, who enjoyed divine pleasures bestowed by the gods.

**47.** Seeing the dancer, Neelajansa, dancing for Indra, Lord Rishabhadeva, due to the lack of understanding of the true meaning of knowledge, became detached.

**48.** The objects that were previously the cause of attachment in this world, now became the cause of peace due to the cessation of the internal cause.

**49.** The objects that previously caused confusion in the mind, now became the producers of peace when the time for peace arrived.

**50.** Having renounced the desire for pleasures and being ashamed of himself for being attached to them for a long time, Lord Rishabhadeva pondered in his mind: "Oh, what a strange thing it is for the embodied beings of the world! They are subject to their own karmas, and others become subject to them."

**51-52.** This dancer, adorned with various limbs of acting, is dancing with gestures and emotions, showing appropriate emotions, with the intention that Indra will be pleased by my dance, and by his pleasure, I will be able to attain greater happiness.

Page #208:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana,

**54.** Alas for the desire to experience happiness of one who is dependent on others! The mind of one who is devoted to others is always troubled.

**55.** What is the happiness of one who considers himself independent? For he is also dependent on his own actions, and his soul is tormented by the thirst for enjoyment.

**56.** The happiness of one who is completely dependent on the soul is dependent on the soul alone. The happiness of one who is dependent on others is dependent on the objects of the senses and on actions.

**57.** Just as the ocean is not satisfied by the flow of rivers, so also in this world, the living being cannot be satisfied by the pleasures of humans, gods, and demons, even in an infinite time.

**58.** I was formerly the king of the Vidyadharas, Mahabala; then I became Lalitanga Deva; then I became the king of Vajrajangha; then I became an Arya in Uttarakuru; then I became Shridhara Deva; then I became the king of Suvidhi; then I became Achyutendra; then I became Vajranabhi; and then I became the god of Sarvarthasiddhi.

**59.** Even after enjoying those divine pleasures for a long time, I was not satisfied. What satisfaction can I have now from these easily available and abundant pleasures?

**60.** Therefore, abandoning this worldly happiness, which is ultimately tainted by sorrow, I enter the forest of penance for the attainment of the happiness of liberation.

**61.** Alas, I, endowed with the three knowledges of Mati, Shruta, and Avadhi, remained in the kingdom like an ordinary man. This is my neglect of time, that is, I did not pay attention to the passing of time. In reality, it is difficult to transgress time - whatever is going to happen at a particular time, happens at that time.

**62.** When the Jina, who knows past lives, was meditating in this way, the celestial beings of the Brahma-loka, Sarasvata, Aditya, etc., came to know about it and came here. They were like the moon, so they came making the sky appear as if it were filled with moons. They bowed down and said to the Lord:

**63-64.** "O Lord! It is good, do whatever brings about the welfare of yourself and others. This is the time for the establishment of the Dharma-tirtha."

**65.** "O Lord! This world is wandering in the great forest of the four paths. Show it the path that leads to the abode of liberation."

**66.** "O Lord! O Lord of the Universe! Like a mantra that has been broken, the path of liberation has been obscured for a long time. Please shine your light on it."

**67.** But she is deluded and thinks like this.

## Ninth Chapter

The three great whirlpools of sorrow, the three great serpents of vices, in this ocean of the world, you are the helmsman for those who are wandering. || 68 || 

O Lord! You are the one who rescues everyone from this great wheel of samsara, which is spinning rapidly, with your hand of instruction. || 69 || 

Now, the saints, having traversed the path shown by you, rest on the peak of the three worlds, free from the fatigue of birth, and eternally blissful. || 70 || 

Just as the water offered to the ocean is only for its worship, so too, the words of the Lokantaka Devas were only for the worship of the self-enlightened one.  || 71 || 

At that time, Indra and the other Devas of the four realms arrived. They also bowed down and spoke the same words that the Lokantaka Devas had spoken repeatedly before them. || 72 || 

At that time, the self-enlightened Lord Rishabhadeva, addressed by the Devas, was adorned like a great lake whose lotus-clusters are blooming with the rays of the sun. || 73 || 

At that time, the accomplished Lord, who had divided the earth among his hundred sons, the valiant and wise, was adorned like the sun, spreading his brilliance for a thousand rays. || 74 || 

Then, the Devas anointed the Jina with the water of the ocean of milk, smeared him with fragrant unguents, and adorned him with the finest garments, ornaments, and garlands. || 75 || 

The Lord, seated in the assembly, adorned with jewel-like ornaments, surrounded by Devas and kings, was adorned like Mount Meru, surrounded by long mountain ranges stretching east and west. || 76 || 

Then, Vaishravana created a new, divine palanquin, named Sudarshana, which was also very beautiful in its splendor. || 77 || 

That palanquin appeared like the sky or a beautiful woman, for just as the sky is resplendent with the brilliance of stars and constellations, and a beautiful woman is radiant with the brilliance of her pupils and jewel-like ornaments, so too, that palanquin was resplendent with the brilliance of jewel-like stars. || 78 ||

In the Harivamsha Purana,

(79) The sky is resplendent with the brilliance of a flock of swans, like a moving mass of white chamaras, and the excellent woman is adorned with white garments, like a flock of swans and a group of white chamaras. Similarly, the palanquin was adorned with white chamaras and garments, like a flock of swans. The sky is radiant with the unblemished brilliance of a mirror, like a circle of light in all directions, and the face of the excellent woman is radiant with the unblemished brilliance of a mirror, like a direction shining with light. Similarly, the palanquin was adorned with a group of mirrors, illuminating all directions with unblemished light.

(80) The sky is adorned with white regions, like bubbles of water, and the cheeks of the excellent woman are white with dots of sandalwood. Similarly, the surrounding area of the palanquin's canopy was white with pearl-like spheres, like bubbles. The sky is adorned with the moon above, and the excellent woman is adorned with a moon-shaped forehead and a head. Similarly, the palanquin was adorned with a moon-like canopy above. The sky is adorned with red clouds of the evening, like glowing corals, and the lower lip of the excellent woman is like a red cloud of the evening and a glowing coral. Similarly, the palanquin was adorned with a glowing coral, like a red cloud of the evening.

(81) The sky is adorned with falling drops of water, like clear pearls and teeth, and the excellent woman is adorned with falling drops of water and teeth, like clear pearls. Similarly, the palanquin was adorned with clear pearls, like falling drops of water. The sky is adorned with a row of flags fluttering on the auspicious chariot of the comet, like beautiful creepers, and the excellent woman is adorned with beautiful creepers, like a row of flags fluttering on an auspicious flagpole. Similarly, the palanquin was adorned with beautiful creepers, like auspicious flags and beautiful arms.

(82) The sky is adorned with thick thighs, like the trunks of elephants and banana trees, and the excellent woman is adorned with beautiful thighs, like the trunks of elephants and banana trees. Similarly, the palanquin was adorned with banana trees, like the trunks of elephants and the thighs of women. The sky is adorned with the light of the Chitra star, and the excellent woman is like the Chitra star and a star.

The palanquin shone brightly, adorned with water-filled pitchers, like the sky with its rain-laden clouds. It was beautiful, adorned with stars like flowers, and with auspicious constellations like large fruits.  ||83||  It was adorned with dark blue gems, like the sky with its dark blue clouds, and was presented to the great sage by Kubera, like a beautiful woman to her beloved. ||84||

Then, the joyful Indra, after asking his parents, children, and dependents, requested the Lord to ascend the palanquin. ||85||  The Lord, attended by Indra and other gods holding fly whisks and umbrellas, walked thirty-two steps on the earth. ||86||  He was greeted with folded hands, shouts of victory, and blessings from the people, and ascended the palanquin like the sun rising on the auspicious dawn. ||87||

The kings lifted the palanquin from the earth, and the gods, standing ready, lifted it into the sky, as if carrying out the Lord's command. ||88||  Then, the conch shells, drums, flutes, and lutes resounded, filling the directions with their music. ||89||

The sky above was filled with the celestial armies of the gods, while the earth below was filled with kings, warriors, and powerful rulers, all moving together. ||90||  The nine rasas (emotions) were manifested in the sky by the dancing apsaras, while the sorrow of the liberated souls was dispelled below. ||91||

Page #212:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, 
The Lord, worshipped by the celestial beings, reached the forest named Siddhartha, covered with Ashoka, Champa, Saptaparna, mango and banyan trees. || 92 || 
The one seeking Siddhi (liberation), descended from the palanquin, just as he had descended from the Sarvarthasiddhi Vimana, situated on the peak of the celestial realm. || 93 || 
Then, the Lord said to the people, "O people, give up sorrow, for the union of beings, even with their own bodies, is for separation." || 94 || 
"I have appointed the very capable Bharat for your protection. Always serve him, who is devoted to his Dharma, and he is worthy of your service." || 95 || 
Having said this, the people worshipped the Lord. The place where the people worshipped the Lord, became known as Prayaga, due to the purpose of worship. || 96 || 
After inquiring from his relatives and the humble king, the Lord renounced both internal and external attachments and embraced austerity. || 97 || 
Indra, with five fists, plucked the hair from the Lord's head and placed them in a mortar, thinking, "These were worn on the Lord's head." With great respect, he threw them into the ocean of milk. || 98 || 
Upon the occurrence of the Diksha Kalyanak, all the gods and demons worshipped the Lord and went to their respective places. Similarly, the humans, filled with anxiety, also went to their respective places after paying their respects. || 99 || 
At that time, four thousand great, devoted kings, belonging to the Ikshvaku, Kuru, Ugra and Bhoj dynasties, also embraced the naked initiation. || 100 || 
The Lord, who endured the Pariṣahas, was a great ascetic, possessed four kinds of knowledge, and was as steadfast as a mountain, remained silent for six months, undergoing Kayotsarga. || 101 || 
Similarly, those other kings, who did not know the ultimate truth, but only wished to act according to the Lord's will, remained steadfast, undergoing Kayotsarga. || 102 || 
When their souls were tormented by hunger and thirst, they thought, "Our servants, sons, or wives will bring us food today or tomorrow." || 103 ||

Then, those who were leading the Kacc, Mahakacc and Marici, were broken within six months by hunger and other hardships. ||10||

Their bodies, emaciated by hunger, had unsteady, wandering eyes. Their wandering vision seemed to be a rehearsal for the future. ||105||

Some saw darkness, even in darkness, as if a hundred moons were vying with the sky. ||106||

Others perceived the entire universe as sound, as if they were contemplating the Vaisheshika doctrine that the sky is characterized by sound. ||107||

Still others, falling down, were not even conscious, as if they were trying to make their souls inert. ||108||

Others, though conscious, were unable to express themselves. They became resigned to their own state, like the Purusha of the Samkhya philosophy. ||109||

Some, with their intellect destroyed by the lack of any support, did not remember anything. They were like the Buddhists, who follow the doctrine of momentariness. ||110||

Thus, with their minds greatly disturbed by hunger, thirst, and other afflictions, they gradually abandoned their bodies and fled. ||111||

As long as one's body is satisfied, one follows one's master, family, children, and moral principles. ||112||

They, the kings, were about to eat fruits and roots, drink water, and bathe, all in their naked state, when the words of the gods were clearly heard in the sky: "Do not engage in such behavior, which is contrary to the nature of a self-controlled person, in this naked form." ||113-114||

Then, terrified and ashamed, they looked in all directions and, using kusa grass, cloth, and bark, they changed their naked attire. ||115||

Harivamsha Purana

Having regained their composure after satisfying their hunger, they discussed what to do, for wise thoughts arise only in a calm mind.  || 116 ||
"What is the Lord's intention in renouncing all pleasures?  It is extremely difficult to believe that He is striving for worldly gains." || 117 ||
"He has seen worldly possessions as calamities, He has renounced pleasure and pain, and He considers objects as poison.  He has abandoned ornaments and clothing as if they were suffering, and He has uprooted the hair on his head with his own hand as if they were enemies.  He has even renounced his body by giving up food and water.  Therefore, it is clear that He must be seeking some otherworldly benefit." || 118-120 ||
"The Lord has adopted the vow of lifelong austerity and is now silent and immobile.  In this situation, we do not know what we should do." || 121 ||
"Returning to our homeland after leaving with Him would not be fitting.  Moreover, it is fraught with many obstacles and hardships." || 122 ||
"If we are unable to follow the Lord's path, then why not imitate His way of life in the forest?" || 123 ||
Having decided thus, they, the sons of Pandu, who ate fallen leaves and fruits, became ascetics with matted hair and bark clothing, dwelling in the forest. || 124 ||
Marichi Kumar, the Lord's grandson, was parched with thirst.  Deluded, he saw a mirage in the desert and rushed towards it, thinking it was water.  Just as entering water brings relief to a burning elephant, the soft earth brought some comfort to his body. || 125-126 ||
Marichi was deeply attached to worldly possessions, so he adopted the saffron robes of a wandering ascetic, which sustain the vow of renunciation.  He carried a single staff, considered himself pure after bathing, and kept his head shaved. || 127 ||
On the other hand, those who were deeply distressed by the lack of pleasures and were troubled by their absence,

**177.**

**129.**  Dharanendra, whose seat was shaking, came to know of this through his knowledge of the future.  He came to the Muni with devotion, for silence is the means to achieve all.

**130.**  He, who was endowed with a divine form, gave assurance to the brothers, just as brothers do to each other.  He bestowed upon them the Great Knowledge, for the attainment of knowledge is through the Guru.

**131.**  Vijayardha, the mountain that is the abode of the Vidyadharas, was also obtained by them from Dharanendra.  What is there that cannot be achieved through service to the Guru?

**132.**  Nami became the lord of fifty cities in the southern region, and Vinami became the ruler of sixty cities in the northern region.

**133.**  Nami, along with his relatives, resided in the excellent city of Rathanupura, and Vinami resided in the city of Nabhastilaka, which bears a meaningful name.

**134.**  The Vidyadharas, having obtained these valiant kings, considered themselves superior to the world.

**135.**  Now, although the valiant Lord, who is the destroyer of enemies, was seated in the form of a statue, having entered the ocean of excellent meditation, which extinguishes the fire of suffering, and was steadfast even after six months of remaining in the form of a statue without food, yet, thinking, "Those other human beings who are present now and who will be in the future, who desire to conquer the enemy of karma in order to attain liberation, will become weak in the absence of food," he began to contemplate.

**136.**  "Dharma, characterized by forgiveness and other qualities, is the main purpose of life, and it is the means to achieve liberation, desire, and wealth.

**137.**  The body is the means to achieve Dharma, and the body is dependent on the life force.  The living being is sustained by the life force, and the life force is sustained by food.

**138.**  Therefore, food is also a means to achieve Dharma, according to tradition.  Food is the cause for the stability of the main purpose of life, Dharma, for those who are of limited strength.

**139.**  Therefore, for the sake of the stability of the Dharma, I will show the method of taking food that is free from defects to those who desire it in this land of Bharat.

**140.**  Thinking thus, although he was capable of overcoming hunger and other afflictions, he decided to act for the benefit of others, not taking food that was not his own.

**141.**  Thus, Nami and Vinami, both princes, who were in a state of suffering, came to the feet of the Lord.

## English Translation:

178
At the end of the six-month fast, the Lord, who had contracted his *pratima* yoga, set out to receive food, his steps causing the earth to sprout like new leaves. ||342||

He remained silent until he attained *kevala* knowledge, his arms hanging down as he walked, his pace neither too fast nor too slow, with utmost care. ||143||

He wandered the earth, following the *chandri* path, and in the midday, he granted darshan to the people in the fine cities and villages, in the rows of houses. ||144||

Just as people are not satisfied seeing the newly risen moon, so too, the people were not satisfied seeing the Lord, the bearer of a gentle form, as they looked up at him while he wandered. ||145||

Seeing the Lord, many people reasoned: "Has the moon descended to the earth, abandoning the constellations and the sun, fearing being swallowed by Rahu? Or has the sun descended to the earth to dispel the darkness of the shadows of mountains, palaces, and trees?" ||146-147||

"Oh, how radiant is this Lord's abode! How glorious is his dwelling place! Oh, he is like a mountain of noble character! Oh, he is an ocean of virtues! He is the ultimate limit of beauty, the supreme abode of grace, the ultimate state of sweetness, and the highest form of patience." ||148-149||

"Come, noble people, come, make your eyes fruitful! See, even being naked, how beautiful he is!" ||150||

Thus, engaged in conversation with each other and gathered in a vast crowd, men and women, filled with wonder, were seeing the Lord. ||151||

At that time, some offered colorful clothes, some offered various ornaments, and some offered the finest fragrances and garlands before the Lord. ||152||

Many ignorant people, immediately arranging horses, tall elephants, chariots, and other vehicles, placed them before him. ||153||

People had never seen or heard of anyone receiving food, nor did they know the Lord's intention.

## Ninth Chapter

**179**

For the awakening of the world, the Sun rises every day.  Similarly, the Jinaraka (Jina, the Sun) did not feel any sorrow in wandering the world for the sake of awakening the people.  ||155||

Just as the Lord of heat (Sun), with his shoulders not burdened for six months, is worshipped by the people and wanders in order, ||156||

So, the Lord, accompanied by elephants, reached the city of Hastinapura.  The city was filled with elephants, as if announcing the prevalence of giving (charity). ||157||

In that city, the two brothers, Soma Prabha and Shreyans, the kings, saw these dreams in their sleep: ||158||

The Moon, Indra's flag, Mount Meru, lightning, the Kalpa tree, the island of jewels, the flying chariot, and the Supreme Being (Purushottama). ||159||

In the morning, the two, the best of the Kuru lineage, were astonished in the assembly and discussed the fruits of their auspicious dreams with the learned group. ||160||

The learned ones explained the fruits of the dreams as follows:  "Just as the Kumuda (Moon) is the friend of the Kumuda (Lotus), so too, a friend of ours, who is like the Moon, will arrive here today, possessing excellent radiance.  He will be the bearer of the flag of high fame, the mountain of all welfare in the world, the Kalpa tree for fulfilling the desires of the world, one who will show his form for a moment like lightning, the great island of jewels of Dharma, and one who has descended from the celestial world of flying chariots.  Just as the Lord Rishabhadeva has shown himself in the dream, will he not appear in person today?  The splendor of the city and the royal palace is visible today, a splendor never seen before.  And the purity of the directions is also announcing good fortune." ||161-164||

Knowing the fruits of the dreams, and having appointed many people inside and outside, the two powerful brothers were discussing the Jina, when the loud sound of the conch shell blown at midday arose.  That sound of the conch seemed to be increasing their joy, as if it were announcing the arrival of the Jina. ||165-166||

In the Harivamsha Purana, it is narrated that after bathing and getting ready, the two brothers were served a divine and delightful meal prepared by their attendants. They were seated on a floor inlaid with precious stones, when Siddhartha, the gatekeeper, arrived swiftly and informed them of the auspicious news, bringing joy and prosperity. 

It is said that when the Lord renounced the earth, the gods, including Indra, carried his palanquin. The one who bears the heavy burden of penance, even when the great men of Kutch, Maha-Kutch, and the east have fallen, is the Lord himself. 

Those who are satisfied with the nectar of his stories and who do not desire food, like you, the wise ones, are filled with forgiveness, friendship, and the wealth of penance. The Lord of the three worlds, Vrishabhadeva, has unexpectedly graced us with his presence today. 

He entered the city from the north, following the proper lunar cycle, his gaze fixed on the end of the age. People, filled with anxiety, offered him water for his feet and served him with praise and adoration. Like the moon, he spread his radiance in every house, and finally reached the inner courtyard of his palace. 

Understanding the meaning of Siddhartha's words, the two brothers, filled with joy, joined their hands and placed them on their foreheads, bowing before the Lord. "O Master, come, give us your command," they said, and circumambulated the Lord as the moon and sun circumambulate Mount Meru. 

Then, falling at his feet, they inquired about his well-being and stood before him, pondering the reason for his arrival. Just as the moon's rays circle Mount Meru along with the stars, Queen Lakshmi, the wife of King Soma Prabha, circumambulated the Lord, accompanied by many other queens. 

The Lord, with his unwavering gaze, looked at Shreyans, and his mind, which had never seen such a form before, was captivated.

Page #219:

## Ninth Canto

181.  Having been awakened by the radiant light, he (Shreyans) realized the ten past lives of himself and the Lord.  He fell unconscious at the Lord's feet. 

182.  Even while unconscious, Shreyans gently wiped the Lord's feet with the soft hair of his head.  He washed them with a stream of warm, joyful tears, to relieve the fatigue of the journey.

183.  Remembering the way the two sons of the Charan, Shrimati and Vajrajangha, had given charity in the past, he (Shreyans) was filled with devotion.

184.  "O Lord! Stay, stay!" he exclaimed, leading the Lord inside the house.  He placed the Lord on a high seat and washed the Lord's lotus feet.

185.  Knowing the rules of charity and being the one who implements them himself, Shreyans performed the three-fold prostration, offering worship to the Lord's feet.

186.  Filled with faith and other virtues, he lifted a pot filled with sugarcane juice, a vessel with all the auspicious signs, and said, "O Lord! This sugarcane juice is free from the sixteen origination defects, the sixteen production defects, the ten passions, and the four giver-related defects of smoke, embers, measure, and connection.  It is fit for offering.  Please accept it."

187.  With a pure heart, the Lord Vrishabhadeva, standing with his feet straight, showed the method of taking the meal, accepting the offering with his hand, for the growth of his conduct.

188.  Having received the Lord, the auspicious Jina, as the recipient of his charity, Shreyans experienced five wonders, arising from five types of purity.

189.  "Oh, what a gift! Oh, what a gift! Oh, what a recipient! Oh, what a method of giving!"  Such sounds arose from the heavens, uttered by the gods.

190.  The divine drums in the sky, sounding like thunder, proclaimed to the three worlds, "The birth of the one who establishes the pilgrimage of charity has taken place!"

191.  The wind, fragrant with the breath of the gods, blew, as if exhaled by the faces of the directions, filled with the glory of the great charity.

192.  A rain of flowers, endless and emanating from the bodies of the gods, fell.  And again, an endless rain of flowers of auspiciousness fell from the heavens.

## Chapter 182

195. As if envious of the stream of nectar flowing from the vessel for the sake of the worthy, the celestial beings showered down a stream of divine gems from the sky.

196. After the worship, when the Dharma Tirthankara, Lord Rishabhadeva, went to the forest for the increase of his austerities, the gods worshipped the Dana Tirthankara, King Shreyans, with an abhisheka.

197. Having heard the proclamation of the appropriate dana and its fruits from the celestial beings, Bharata and other kings assembled and worshipped Shreyans.

198. Remembering the events of the past, Bharata and other kings, who were witnesses to the direct fruits of dana, listened with great faith to the method of dana dharma as expounded by Shreyans.

199-200. King Shreyans explained that there are nine ways to accumulate the merit of dana: 1. Providing hospitality to a guest, 2. Seating them in a high place, 3. Washing their feet, 4. Being worshipped by the giver, 5. Offering salutations, 6. Purity of mind, 7. Purity of speech, 8. Purity of body, and 9. Purity of food.

201. Explaining the fruits of dana, King Shreyans said that the merit accumulated by giving dana in this way first grants the giver fruits like heaven, and ultimately leads to liberation.

202. Thus, having listened to the truth, the kings like Bharata, whose minds were eager for dana dharma, departed as they had come.

203. Lord Rishabhadeva, adorned with four faces representing the four knowledges, performed various austerities for a thousand years to attain the true knowledge of liberation.

204. The Adi Jinendra, adorned with the weight of long matted hair, was resplendent like a banyan tree whose branches were laden with fruits.

205. While wandering, the Lord reached the city of Purvatala, where the younger brother of Bharata, King Vrishabhasena, resided.

206. There, in the garden called Shakatasya, he sat down beneath a banyan tree, absorbed in meditation, on a stone slab with a cushion.

207. At that time, he controlled the senses with the sharpness of the sword of white meditation.

He, mounted on the chariot of the क्षपक श्रेणी, in a moment, defeated the king of delusion, riding on the elephant of great enthusiasm. ||208|| He destroyed the enemy of knowledge-obscuring, the enemy of the ten obscurations, and the enemy of the internal obstacles, all at once. ||209|| From the destruction of the four ghatiya karmas, his pure knowledge arose, encompassing the perception of all the categories of existence and the worlds. ||210|| The four divine assemblies, as before, came together. The Indra, along with the other gods, sang the victory of the Jina, the Nemujina. ||211|| Then, with eight miracles and thirty-four special excellences, the Jina became adorned. ||212|| The news of the birth of his son, the acquisition of the Chakra Ratna, and the attainment of Kevala Jnana by the Jina, reached Bharat at the same time. Filled with joy at this fortunate event, Bharat set out to pay his respects to the Jina. ||213|| Accompanied by the kings of the Kuru and Bhoj dynasties, and surrounded by a fourfold army, Bharat arrived and, bowing down to the Jina, worshipped him, adorned with the glory of the Arhant. ||214|| At the same time, King Vrishabhasena, along with many other kings, went to the Jina and, embracing the path of restraint, became the first Ganadhar of the Jina. ||215|| Having appointed Jayakumar, the son of Lakshmi, and his younger brother to the kingdom, the kings Shreyans and Soma Prabha also took initiation. ||216|| The two princes, Brahmi and Sundari, filled with courage, took initiation and became the leaders of many women. ||217|| Seeing the glory of the Arhant, Vrishabha Jina, others also, at that time, embraced the right faith and the vows of the Shravakas, according to their capacity. ||218|| At that time, men and women, free from attachment, were adorned, pulling out their black hair, like the Indranila gem, with their red hands, like the Padma raga gem. ||219|| At that time, those who took initiation, being steadfast in their minds, had no attachment to their bodies, just as they had no attachment to their soft, smooth, and dense hair. ||220|| Then, in the sky, a Samavasarana was created, twelve yojanas in extent, where the fourfold assembly, the four divine assemblies, and the Sangha, all gathered. ||221||

##  Translation:

**184**

In the Harivamsha Purana, the supremely powerful **Shasana Devata** (divine rulers of the Jain religion) were present there, including **Nemichandra** and **Apratichkra** (Jain Tirthankaras), and they constantly paid homage to **Vrishabhanatha**, the holder of the Dharmachakra (wheel of righteousness). ||222||

The **munis** (ascetics) stood to the right of the **Jina** (Tirthankara), along with the **Kalpangana** (celestial nymphs), the **Aryikas** (Jain nuns), and the groups of **Jyotish** (astronomical) and **Vyantara** (intermediate) **devatas** (deities), each in their respective order. The **Bhavana** (dwelling) **devatas**, the **Jyotish** (astronomical) **devatas**, the **Kalpanga** (celestial nymphs), the **kings**, and the **tiryanch** (animals) were all present, each in their own vast space, forming twelve **ganas** (groups). ||223||

When the beings of the three realms were seated peacefully, eager to hear the **Jina**'s divine teachings, the first **Ganadhara** (leader of a gana) asked the **Jina**, the sun who illuminates all things, a question. The **Jina**, with his divine voice, a radiant treasure that transcended the limitations of the lips, dispelled the darkness of delusion, revealing the truth in its many forms. ||224||

Thus ends the ninth **parva** (chapter) of the Harivamsha Purana, composed by **Jinasena Acharya**, which narrates the attainment of **kevalgyan** (omniscience) by **Vrishabhanatha**, along with the collection of the **Arishta Nemichandra Purana**.

## The Tenth Chapter

While preaching Dharma in the presence of the beings of the three worlds, the Lord broke his silence, which had been steadfast for a thousand years. ||1||

The Lord of the Tirthankaras himself shows the way to cross the ocean of Samsara. Therefore, all beings in the world see the profound meaning with clarity. ||2||

When the sun of the Jina, radiant with the brilliance of speech and other excellences, illuminates the objects, who can then embrace the darkness of falsehood? ||3||

The Jina then spoke, saying that Dharma, the source of all happiness, should be practiced by all beings with utmost effort, especially in acts of compassion for all living beings. ||4||

The happiness that is found in the four classes of Devas and in humans, which arises from the objects of the senses, is all born from Dharma. ||5||

And the happiness of liberation, which arises from the destruction of karma, is infinite and self-dependent, and it too is born from Dharma. ||6||

Non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy, and non-attachment - these are the Dharma of the monks when practiced subtly, and the Dharma of the householders when practiced grossly. ||7||

Charity, worship, austerity, and good conduct - these are the four types of physical Dharma for the householders, which are to be performed with the body. This fourfold Dharma of the householders arises from renunciation. ||8||

This Dharma of the householders, whose root is Right Faith, bestows the wealth of great Devas, and the Dharma of the monks, when fully practiced, grants the happiness of liberation. ||9||

Those who are desirous of their own welfare, who can only see what is immediate, should know the characteristics of the proper Dharma, which is the root of heaven and liberation, through the knowledge of the scriptures. ||10||

The twelve-limbed knowledge of the scriptures, which is based on the distinction between substance and state, is revealed by the Perfect Ones. The Perfect One is considered to be free from all faults. ||11||

It is heard in the Harivamsha Purana that there are twenty categories of Shruta Jnana, namely:

1. **Paryaya**
2. **Paryaya Samaas**
3. **Akshara**
4. **Akshara Samaas**
5. **Pada**
6. **Pada Samaas**
7. **Sanghata**
8. **Samaas**
9. **Pratipatti**
10. **Pratipatti Samaas**
11. **Anuyoga**
12. **Anuyoga Samaas**
13. **Prabhrita Prabhrita**
14. **Prabhrita Prabhrita Samaas**
15. **Prabhrita**
16. **Prabhrita Samaas**
17. **Vastu**
18. **Vastu Samaas**
19. **Purva**
20. **Purva Samaas**

These twenty categories are based on the twenty different aspects of Shruta Jnana.

**12-13**

One of the many variations of Shruta Jnana is a single short syllable. This variation involves the accumulation of Skandhas, which are formed from an infinite number of Pudgala Paramanus.

**14**

When this single short syllable variation is divided into infinite parts, one of those parts is called **Paryaya** Shruta Jnana.

**15**

This **Paryaya** Jnana belongs to a subtle, non-perfect, and non-complete-bodied being. It is free from the Shruta Jnana Avarana.

**16**

All beings have a certain amount of knowledge that is never covered by Avaranas. If Avaranas were to cover that knowledge, then there would be a complete absence of knowledge utilization, and without knowledge utilization, there would be no being.

**17**

It is logically proven that the utilization power of a being never perishes. Just as the light of the sun and moon continues to shine even when covered by clouds, similarly, **Paryaya** Jnana continues to shine even when covered by Avaranas.

**18**

When this **Paryaya** Jnana combines with an infinite part of itself, it is called **Paryaya Samaas** Shruta Jnana. This Shruta Jnana is accompanied by Avaranas. It remains hidden as long as the **Paryaya Samaas** Avarana exists. It only becomes manifest when the Avarana is destroyed.

**19**

This **Paryaya Samaas** Jnana is accompanied by infinite, innumerable, and countable parts, as well as infinite, innumerable, and countable losses. It also involves countable, innumerable, and infinite multiplications of **Paryaya** Jnana.

**20-21**

This **Paryaya Samaas** Jnana continues to grow until it reaches the fullness of Akshara Jnana. After that, Akshara Jnana begins, and it grows one syllable at a time until it reaches Pada Jnana. This growing knowledge is called **Akshara Samaas** Jnana. After **Akshara Samaas** comes Pada Jnana.

**22**

Pada is of three types: **Artha Pada**, **Pramana Pada**, and **Madhyama Pada**.

**23**

The first Pada consists of one, two, three, four, five, six, or seven syllables. The second Pada consists of eight syllables.

## The Tenth Chapter

**187**

Thirty-four crore, sixteen hundred, eighty-two lakh, seventy-eight hundred, eighty-eight syllables are in the middle part. The number of angas and the previous ones is the same as the middle part. ||24||

Eighty-eight syllables are in the middle part. The number of angas and the previous ones is the same as the middle part. ||25||

By increasing one syllable at a time, from the compound word to the end of the previous compound word, the entire twelve-anga scripture is established. ||26||

The first anga, Acharanga, describes the conduct of the monks in detail and contains eighteen thousand words. ||27||

The second anga, Sutra-kritanga, describes the proper and improper times in detail and contains thirty-six thousand words. ||28||

The third anga, Stananga, describes the ten states of a being from one to ten and contains forty-two thousand words. ||29||

The fourth anga, Samavayanga, contains one lakh sixty-four thousand words and describes the equality of substances, etc. ||30||

Just as the substances of dharma, adharma, one being, and the space of the universe are equal in extent - they are infinite in extent - this equality in relation to substances is described by the Samavayanga. ||31||

The Siddhashila, the boundary of the first hell, the Indravil of the Nagas, the Ritu-Vimana of the first heaven, and the two and a half Dwipas are equal in extent - they are forty-five lakh yojanas in extent - this equality in relation to extent is mentioned in the same Samavayanga. ||32||

The equality of the Utsarpini and Avasarpini in relation to time is mentioned, i.e., both are ten-ten kodi-kodi sagara in extent. And the equality of Kevalgyan and Kevaldarshan in relation to essence is explained, i.e., just as there are infinite indivisible parts of Kevalgyan, so too there are infinite indivisible parts of Kevaldarshan. ||33||

The fifth anga, Vyākhyāprajñapti, contains two lakh twenty-eight thousand words. In this anga, the Kumargityagi, Ganadhara, etc.

## The Tenth Chapter

**189.**  Destiny, nature, time, fate, and effort, these five, with the four categories of self, other, eternal, and non-eternal, make twenty distinctions.  These twenty distinctions, when combined with the nine substances starting with the soul, result in one hundred and eighty distinctions for the actionists.  

**49.**  For example, some believe the soul is self-existent due to destiny, some believe it is other-existent, some believe it is eternal, and some believe it is non-eternal.  Some believe the soul is self-existent due to nature, some believe it is other-existent, some believe it is eternal, and some believe it is non-eternal.  Some believe the soul is self-existent due to time, some believe it is other-existent, some believe it is eternal, and some believe it is non-eternal.  

**50.**  Some believe the soul is self-existent due to fate, some believe it is other-existent, some believe it is eternal, and some believe it is non-eternal.  Some believe the soul is self-existent due to effort, some believe it is other-existent, some believe it is eternal, and some believe it is non-eternal.  Just as there are twenty distinctions for the soul due to destiny and other causes, there are also twenty distinctions for the non-soul substances.  Thus, the actionists have a total of one hundred and eighty distinctions.

**51.**  The seven substances starting with the soul are neither self-existent nor other-existent in relation to destiny, nature, time, fate, and effort.  Therefore, multiplying the seven substances by five, we get thirty-five.  Multiplying thirty-five by two (self and other), we get seventy distinctions.  

**52.**  Again, the seven substances starting with the soul are neither self-existent nor other-existent in relation to time.  Therefore, multiplying seven by two, we get fourteen distinctions.  Adding these fourteen distinctions to the previous seventy, we get eighty-four distinctions for the non-actionists.

**53.**  Who knows the nine substances starting with the soul in relation to the seven categories of being, non-being, both, non-declarable, being-non-declarable, non-being-non-declarable, and both-non-declarable?  Thus, multiplying nine substances by seven categories, we get sixty-three distinctions for the ignorant and false-sighted.

**54.**  For example, who knows if the soul is real?  Who knows if the soul is unreal?  Who knows if the soul is both real and unreal?  Who knows if the soul is non-declarable?  Who knows if the soul is real and non-declarable?  Who knows if the soul is unreal and non-declarable?  Who knows if the soul is both real and unreal and non-declarable?  Similarly, applying these seven categories to the non-soul substances, we get sixty-three distinctions.  

**55.**  The actionists have one hundred and eighty distinctions, the non-actionists have eighty-four, the ignorant have sixty-three, and the humble have thirty-two.

In the Harivamsha Purana, due to the acceptance of various alternatives based on emotions, there are sixty-three and sixty-seven types of ignorant views.  (5)  It is necessary to be respectful towards mother, father, gods, kings, knowledgeable people, children, elders, and ascetics through mind, speech, body, and charity.  (59)  Due to the combination of these four (mind, speech, body, and charity) with the eight (mother, etc.), there are thirty-two types of respectful ignorant views.  (60)  Thus, there are five divisions of the view-doctrine: 1. Perikarma, 2. Sutra, 3. Anuyoga, 4. Purvagata, and 5. Chulikā.  (61)  Within Perikarma, there are five Prajñaptis: 1. Chandra Prajñapti, 2. Surya Prajñapti, 3. Jambudvipa Prajñapti, 4. Dvipa-Samudra Prajñapti, and 5. Vyākhyā Prajñapti.  (62)  The Chandra Prajñapti describes the moon's enjoyment and other wealth through thirty-six lakh and five thousand words.  (63)  The Surya Prajñapti describes the sun's wife and other powers through five lakh and three thousand words.  (64)  The Jambudvipa Prajñapti describes the entirety of Jambudvipa through three lakh and twenty-five thousand words.  (65)  The fourth, Dvipa-Samudra Prajñapti, describes islands and oceans through fifty-two lakh and thirty-six thousand words.  (66)  The fifth, Vyākhyā Prajñapti, is composed of eighty-four lakh and thirty-six thousand words.  (67)  The Vyākhyā Prajñapti describes in detail the material and immaterial substances, as well as the groups of worthy and unworthy beings.  (68)  The second division of the view-doctrine, Sutra, has eighty-eight lakh words.  Its various divisions include: 1. Abandhak (non-binding) emotions, 2. The meaning of the Vedas, Smritis, and Puranas, 3. The aspect of destiny, and 4. Various other views.  (69-70)  The third division of the view-doctrine, Anuyoga, has five thousand words.  Its sub-division, Prathama Anuyoga, describes the Puranas of the foolish, the stick-men, and the men of the past.  (71)  The view-doctrine's...

## Translation:

**196**

In the Harivamsha Purana, it is said that the knowledge of scriptures (Shruta) arises due to the destruction and pacification of the Shruta-knowledge-obstructing karma. It is preceded by intellectual knowledge (Mati-jnana), is indirect (Paroksha), and encompasses infinite objects. ||14||

The knowledge arising from the five senses and the mind is called intellectual knowledge (Mati-jnana). This intellectual knowledge is of many kinds and is indirect. If it arises in the presence of objects, it is also called practical direct knowledge (Vyavaharik Pratyaksha). ||145||

This intellectual knowledge (Mati-jnana) depends on the destruction and pacification of the intellectual-knowledge-obstructing karma. It is of four types based on the distinctions of grasping (Avgraha), desire (Iha), aversion (Avyaya), and retention (Dharana). ||146||

The four distinctions of grasping (Avgraha) etc. arise from the six, namely the five senses and the mind. Therefore, multiplying four by six, there are twenty-four types of intellectual knowledge (Mati-jnana). ||147||

Adding the four types of knowledge arising from sound, smell, taste, and touch, which are related to the grasping of meaning (Vyanjana-Avgraha), to these twenty-four types, there are twenty-eight types of intellectual knowledge (Mati-jnana). Adding the four basic distinctions of grasping (Avgraha) etc. to these twenty-eight types, there are thirty-two types. Thus, there are twenty-four, twenty-eight, and thirty-two types. In this way, there are three initial categories of intellectual knowledge (Mati-jnana) with twenty-four, twenty-eight, and thirty-two types. Multiplying these three categories by the six objects, namely many (Bah), manifold (Bahuvich), swift (Kshipra), non-emitted (Nihsrita), unspoken (Anukta), and firm (Dhruva), respectively, there are one hundred and forty-four, one hundred and sixty-eight, and one hundred and ninety-two types. If the six objects, namely many (Bah) etc., and their opposites, namely one (Eka) etc., a total of twelve objects, are multiplied by the three categories, there are two hundred and eighty-eight, three hundred and thirty-six, and three hundred and eighty-four types. ||148-150||

These variations in intellectual knowledge (Mati-jnana) are manifested due to the difference in the destruction and pacification of the intellectual-knowledge-obstructing karma. They occur in the souls with right vision (Samyagdrsti). The intellectual knowledge (Mati-jnana) of souls with wrong vision (Mithyadrsti) is called wrong intellectual knowledge (Kumati-jnana). ||151||

When the soul becomes pure due to the destruction and pacification of the knowledge-of-limitation-obstructing karma (Avadhi-jnana-avarana karma), there are three types of knowledge of limitation (Avadhi-jnana), namely knowledge of limited space (Desha-avadhi), knowledge of all space (Sarva-avadhi), and knowledge of supreme space (Parama-avadhi). This knowledge of limitation (Avadhi-jnana) is direct knowledge of space (Desha-pratyaksha) and has the object of the substance of matter (Pudgala-dravya). ||152||

The knowledge of mental perception (Manah-paryaya-jnana) is also direct knowledge of space (Desha-pratyaksha). It has two types, namely vast intellect (Vipula-mati) and straight intellect (Riju-mati). This knowledge of limitation (Avadhi-jnana) has the object of subtle matter compared to the knowledge of limitation (Avadhi-jnana). If the knowledge of limitation (Avadhi-jnana) knows an atom, this knowledge knows its infinite parts. ||153||

The ultimate knowledge is perfect knowledge (Kevala-jnana). It arises from the destruction of the perfect-knowledge-obstructing karma (Kevala-jnana-avarana karma), is direct knowledge of all (Sarva-pratyaksha), is imperishable, and knows all objects. ||154||

The fruit of the indirect evidence is the arising of the intellect to abandon the undesirable and to accept the desirable, while the fruit of the direct evidence is the absence of attachment and aversion, and the destruction of the previous delusion. ||155||

The fourfold knowledge, namely, faith, knowledge, conduct, and liberation, are the causes of liberation. The eternal, pure knowledge is the direct cause of liberation. ||156||

Faith in the objects known through evidence is called right faith, and the inclination towards auspicious actions is called right conduct. ||157||

Right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, these three are the means of liberation. Therefore, a person desiring the highest wealth should have faith in them and act accordingly. ||158||

There is no other cause of liberation, nor was there, nor will there be. This is the essence of all. ||159||

Thus, having drunk the medicine in the form of the words of the first Tirthankara, the three worlds became free from the disease of doubt, and became as beautiful as if they had attained liberation. ||160||

In that auspicious age, those beings who had already accepted the three jewels as ornaments, became even more steadfast in their faith upon hearing the divine sound of the Lord. And many new people took initiation into the monk and lay follower dharma, and became adorned with the qualities of right faith, etc. ||161||

The four types of gods, endowed with pure right faith and right knowledge, and eager to wander in the world, bowed down to the Lord Jinendra, who was accompanied by the fourfold sangha, and went to their respective abodes. ||162||

King Bharateshwara, who was in the householder stage and was the chief among the lay followers, worshipped the Lord Jinendra and, filled with joy, returned to Ayodhya with the noble kings. ||163||

Thus ends the tenth chapter of the Harivansha Purana, composed by Jinaseena Acharya, which is a collection of the Arishta-nemi Purana, and describes the beginning of the dharma-tirtha by the first Tirthankara. ||164||

Then, the son of Karva, Bharata, celebrated a great festival. He was ready to conquer the six continents.  [1]

He was accompanied by a great army of four divisions, along with a group of kings, and the Chakra Ratna, which led the way from all directions. [2]

He arrived at the Ganges, following its course, and reached the confluence of the Ganges and the ocean. At the Ganges Gate, he performed a three-day fast, purifying his mind, speech, and body. [3]

He entered the Ashvayuga, riding a swift chariot drawn by two horses. He plunged into the great ocean, reaching his knees in the water. The mighty-armed Bharata held the Vajrakanḍa bow in his hand, standing in the Vaishākha posture. He was skilled in fixing his gaze, clenching his fist, and placing the arrow on the string. [4-5]

He released a swift-moving arrow named Amogha, marked with his own name. [6]

The arrow, shining like a thunderbolt, flew twelve yojanas and landed in the palace of the Magadha king, filling the sky with its sound. [7]

The Magadha king was shaken, both in his heart and in his palace. He was filled with anger when he saw the arrow marked with the name of the Chakravarti. He realized his own merit was small and began to criticize himself. His pride was shattered, and he approached Bharata with jewels in his hand. [8-9]

He offered Bharata a necklace made of the essence of the earth, a crown, two earrings made of jewels, precious stones, clothes, and holy water. He said, "O Lord, tell me what I should do. Give me your command." Then, taking leave of Bharata, he returned to his place. Bharata also departed from there. [10-11]

He conquered the powerful armies of the Dakshinatyas, who were gathered in the Bhūtavyaantara region, and reached the Vijayanta Gate, the gateway to the ocean. [12]

Then, a celebration of Bharata's son's birth took place, along with the worship of the Chakra Ratna. After that, he set out to conquer the six continents. [1]

There, they called upon the lord, Varatanu, who was like the king of Magadha. He came bearing a divine diadem, a beautiful necklace, and a shield. [13] He also brought a belt for Viraanga, a bracelet for the wrist, and a string for the waist. Bowing down to Bharata, he said, "I am now your servant, I have come." [14] 

Conquering the west, and subduing all the kings, Bharata, the lord of the world, reached the beautiful gate of the Sindhu river, following the path of the Vedas. [15] There, like Indra in his might, he subdued Prabhasa, the lord of that place, who was like the gate of the Ganga. [16] From him, he received a garland of the finest flowers from the trees of the Santaanaka, a net of pearls, a crown, and a golden belt adorned with jewels. [17] 

Following the path of the Chakra-ratna, Bharata reached the platform of the Vijayardha mountain. There, he fasted and remembered the lord of the mountain, Vijayardha Kumar. [18] Knowing by his divine knowledge that Bharata had arrived, Vijayardha Kumar, the god, bowed down to him and performed his abhisheka with great blessings. He offered him a fragrant flower, water from a pitcher, a supreme throne, an umbrella, and two chamaras, saying, "I am yours, your servant." And then he departed. [19-20] 

There, Bharata, having worshipped the Chakra-ratna, reached the entrance of the Tamisra cave. There, the god, Kritamala, came to him, filled with fear. [21] Bharata gave him fourteen divine ornaments, including a tilak, and bowing down, Kritamala said, "I am yours," and departed. [22] 

By the command of the king of kings, Bharata, his commander, Ayodhya, mounted the horse, Kumudamelaka, whose color was like that of a parrot, and turning his back, he struck the doors of the cave with the Danda-ratna, and then fled back. [23-24] 

When the open entrance of the cave became free of heat after six months, the Chakravarti, mounted on the elephant, Vijayaparbata, entered the cave with his army. [25] In the middle of the cave, there were two rivers, Unmagnjala and Nimmagnjala. On their banks, Bharata left his armies. [26]

In the Harivamsha Purana, the darkness of the mouth was dispelled by the radiance of the Kakani Mani. The army of Bharat stayed there, free from sloth, for a day and a night. ||20||
The house-holder Ratna, named Kamadrishti, and the architect Ratna, named Ratnabhadra-mukha, quickly built strong bridges over the rivers. ||28||
Crossing the bridges, the army of Bharat quickly moved forward, and, as before, opened the northern gate and entered North India. ||29||
Seeing the unparalleled army of the Chakravarti, thousands of Mlechchha kings of North India were enraged and quickly came forward to fight without hesitation. ||30||
Then, filled with anger, the Ayodhya commander fought the Mlechchha kings in battle, quickly defeated them, and made his name "Ayodhya" meaningful. ||31||
Frightened by the commander, the Mlechchhas sought refuge in their Kula-Devatas, the fierce Naga-Kumaras, who lay on beds of Darbha grass. ||32||
The Naga-Kumaras, who filled the sky, stood ready for battle, but Jayakumar fought them and defeated them, and thus obtained the name "Mesh-svara". ||33||
After a while, the Naga-Kumaras filled the sky with fierce clouds and rained down water on the heads of the army in torrents as thick as a fist. ||34||
Seeing the rain, which was accompanied by the thunderous roar of lightning and thunderbolts, the Chakravarti spread a skin-jewel below the army and a jewel-umbrella above. ||35||
The army, which stretched for twelve yojanas and floated on the water, looked like an egg. The army remained terrified for seven days. ||36||
Then, the lord of treasures, the Chakravarti, became angry and commanded the Ganabaddha Devas, who defeated and drove away the Naga-Kumaras. ||37||
Then, inspired by the Naga-Kumaras, who had restrained the rain, the Mlechchha kings, taking their best daughters, sought refuge in the Chakravarti. ||38||
The Chakravarti gave assurance to those frightened Mlechchha kings, who desired his protection, and then, free from fatigue, he traveled along the banks of the Sindhu river. ||39||
The Sindhu Devi, who resided on the peak of the Sindhu mountain, crowned him and gave him a seat of honor, adorned with a footstool. ||40||

**201**

Having established his army at the foot of the Himalayas, the Chakravarti, having observed the eight-day fast, rested on a bed of darbha grass. **41**

Having bathed in the sacred waters and adorned himself with exquisite ornaments, he mounted his chariot drawn by horses, with the Chakra-ratna leading the way. **42**

He then proceeded to the small peak of the Himalayas called Himavat, where he stood on the Vaishakha platform, facing south. **43**

"Hear my command, O Naga-Kumaras, Suparna-Kumaras, and other celestial beings who dwell in this land!" he declared, drawing his bow and releasing an arrow. **45**

The arrow, sounding like thunder, flew twelve yojanas and struck the ground. A celestial being, dwelling on the Himavat peak, saw it and approached Bharat. **45**

He offered Bharat a garland of divine herbs and a divine sandalwood, and having worshipped him, he took his leave, eager to carry out his command. **46**

The Chakravarti then proceeded to the Vrishabha mountain, where he inscribed his name in clear letters with a Kakani gem: "I am Bharat, the Chakravarti, son of Lord Vrishabhadeva." Having inscribed and read his name, he approached the platform of the Vijayardha mountain. **47-48**

There, he observed a fast. When the two श्रेणीs (groups) of residents, Nimi and Vinimi, learned of Bharat's presence, they arrived with the Gandharvas and other celestial beings. **49**

All the celestial beings bowed to him, and Bharat accepted the celestial woman, Subhadra, from Nimi and Vinimi. He then proceeded along the banks of the Ganga river, reaching the Ganga-kूट, where he observed a three-day fast. **50**

Ganga Devi, residing on the Ganga-kूट, learned of his arrival and performed an abhisheka (ceremony) for him with a thousand golden pots. **51**

She then presented him with two jeweled thrones, adorned with footrests. Vijayardha Kumar, the lord of the Vijayardha mountain, stood in attendance upon the Chakravarti. **52**

From there, Bharat proceeded, subduing eighteen thousand Mlechchha kings and receiving from them the finest jewels. He then reached the second cave of Vijayardha, near the Khanḍakā waterfall. **53**

There, Harivansh Purana states that the deity Natyamala bestowed upon him the name Uposhitashtamaya. He adorned him with various ornaments and two earrings that shone like lightning. ||54|| Just as the commander of Ayodhya had previously opened the cave door of the Sindhu River with the Danda Ratna, here too he opened the cave door of the Ganga River with the Danda Ratna, and Bharat entered through that door and emerged with his army. ||55|| In this way, the extremely skilled Bharat conquered the entire Bharat Kshetra, consisting of six divisions, in sixty thousand years, and then set out for Ayodhya. ||56|| 
When the Sudarshan Chakra did not enter Ayodhya, Bharat, filled with doubt, asked the wise priest Buddhisagar, "Why is this divine Chakra Ratna not entering Ayodhya even after conquering the entire Bharat Kshetra? Now there is no one worthy of our battle?" ||57-58|| The priest said, "Your powerful brothers do not obey your orders." ||59|| Hearing this, Bharat quickly sent messengers to them with the principles of Sama, Dama, etc. ||60|| Subsequently, those who had attained enlightenment due to this reason, Bharat's proud brothers, considered renunciation as a great festival and abandoned their respective kingdoms. ||61|| All of Bharat's brothers, who were afraid of the world, who had shed their pride-like thorns, and who desired liberation in their hearts, went to Lord Vrishabhadeva and took initiation. ||62|| The names of those delicate and glorious princes who left their countries should be known to the learned. ||63|| Kuru, Jangala, Panchal, Surasen, Patacchara, Tulinga, Kashi, Kaushalya, Madrakar, Vrikarthaka, Solva, Avrusht, Trigart, Kushagra, Matsya, Kuniyan, Koshal, and Mok are the countries of Madhyadesha. ||64-65|| Vahlik, Atreya, Kamboj, Yavan, Abhir, Madrak, Kwathatoy, Shur, Vatavan, Kaikaya, Gandhar, Sindhu, Sauvira, Bharadwaj, Daseruka, Prasthal, and Tornkarna are the countries located in the north. ||66-67|| Khadga, Angarak, Pond, Mall, Pravak, Mastak, Pradyotisha, Vanga, Magadha, Manavatika,

Malad and Bhargava, these countries were situated in the east. Banamukta, Vaidarbh, Manav, Sakkaapir, Mulak, Ashmak, Daandok, Kalinga, Aanshik, Kuntal, Navarashtr, Maahishk, Purush and Bhogavardhan, these were the countries of the south. Maly, Kallivanopaant, Durg, Surpar, Karbuk, Kaakshi, Naasaarik, Agatam, Saarasvat, Taapas, Mahim, Bharukachch, Surashtr and Narmad, all these countries were situated in the west. Dasharnk, Kishkandh, Tripura, Aavart, Naishdh, Nepal, Uttamavarn, Vaidish, Antap, Kaushal, Pattana and Vinihaatr, these countries were situated on the Vindhyachal. ||68-74|| Bhadra, Vats, Videh, Kush, Bhang, Saitav and Vajrakhandik, these countries were dependent on Madhyadesh. ||75|| These countries, which were given by the father, the Lord Vasubhadev, were abandoned by the younger brothers of Bharat, who desired liberation, like women. They also abandoned their obedient servants. ||76||
Then, Kumar Bahubali expressed his opposition to Bharat. He considered his Sudarshanchakra as insignificant as Alatchakra and sent a messenger saying, 'I am not under your control'. And he quickly set out for war from Podanpur with an Akshouhini army. ||77-78|| From there, Bharat, whose army was like a sea, reached the west of the Vitta river, where the two armies clashed. ||79|| Then, the ministers of both the kings consulted each other and said that there should be a righteous war between the two kings so that the people of the country are not destroyed. ||80|| Bharat and Bahubali accepted the advice of their ministers and first started a war of sight. The gods and the Vidyadharas, who were standing in the sky, saw both of them for a long time with their eyes that were free from blinking. That is, both the brothers stood for a long time with their eyes that were free from blinking and neither of them lost. But in the end, the younger brother defeated the elder brother because the elder brother was five hundred bows tall, so his sight was towards the top, and the younger brother was twenty-five bows taller than him, so his sight was towards the bottom. ||81-82|| After the war of sight, there was a terrible water war between the two brothers in the pond. 1.

In the Harivamsha Purana, there was a fierce and skillful wrestling match between the two brothers on the battlefield. 8
Their hearts were filled with animosity, and the earth, like a woman, trembled in fear as they fought. 85
Bharata, the compassionate and strong-armed, lifted his brother with his powerful arms, like a god lifting a mountain of jewels. 86
The spectators, the gods, the celestial beings, and the earthly beings all exclaimed, "Oh, what strength! Oh, what courage! Well done! Well done!" 87
Having won the fight, Bharata, filled with anger, remembered the Sudarshana Chakra, the weapon of death, and it appeared in his hand, capable of holding a thousand arrows. 88
He whirled the chakra, guarded by a thousand Yakshas and shining like the sun, and hurled it at his brother to kill him. 89
But the divine chakra, unable to destroy the one with the perfect body, returned after circling three times. 90
Seeing his brother's cruelty, the strong-armed one covered his ears with his hands and condemned Lakshmi, saying, 91
"Just as mud pollutes pure, clear, and mixed water, so too does Lakshmi corrupt the pure, good, and united minds of men. Therefore, she is to be condemned." 92
"Just as a millstone, a mechanical device, destroys the long-lasting oil of sweet and smooth sesame seeds and is very unstable, so too does Lakshmi destroy the long-lasting love and affection of sweet and loving people and is very unstable. Therefore, she is to be condemned." 93
"Just as the venomous serpent's gaze is unbearable and frightening even to the king of physicians, so too is Lakshmi unbearable and frightening to even the kings of men. Therefore, she is to be condemned." 94
At that time, both brothers were striking each other with their arms, causing unbearable pain. But even in this battle, the elder brother Bharata was defeated. 83
After that, the two brothers engaged in a long wrestling match on the battlefield. Their wrestling match was filled with the sound of claps and was full of various tricks. 84
At that time, the earth, like a woman, cried out in fear, her heart shattered by the blows of the two warriors. 85
Finally, the compassionate and strong-armed one, with his powerful arms, lifted Bharata and stood there, like a god lifting a mountain of jewels. 86
The spectators, the groups of gods, the celestial beings, and the earthly beings all exclaimed at that time, "Oh, what strength! Oh, what courage! Well done! Well done!" 87
After winning the fight, the strong-armed one, filled with anger, remembered the Sudarshana Chakra, the weapon of death, and as soon as he remembered it, the Sudarshana Chakra, capable of holding a thousand arrows, appeared in his hand. 88
He whirled the Sudarshana Chakra, guarded by a thousand Yakshas and shining like the sun, and hurled it at his brother to kill him. 89
But the divine chakra, unable to destroy the one with the perfect body, returned after circling three times. 90
Seeing his brother's cruelty, the strong-armed one covered his ears with his hands and condemned Lakshmi, saying, 91
"Just as mud pollutes pure, clear, and mixed water, so too does Lakshmi corrupt the pure, good, and united minds of men. Therefore, she is to be condemned." 92
"Just as a millstone, a mechanical device, destroys the long-lasting oil of sweet and smooth sesame seeds and is very unstable, so too does Lakshmi destroy the long-lasting love and affection of sweet and loving people and is very unstable. Therefore, she is to be condemned." 93
"Just as the venomous serpent's gaze is unbearable and frightening even to the king of physicians, so too is Lakshmi unbearable and frightening to even the kings of men. Therefore, she is to be condemned." 94

**95.** Just as the flame of fire is always painful to touch, from its root to its tip, and though it shines brightly, it burns all, so too is this Lakshmi, painful to touch from beginning to end, causing suffering in all situations, and though it shines brightly, it burns all, being the mother of anxiety, therefore, it is to be condemned.

**96.** In the mortal world, happiness is that which brings contentment to the mind. But in the presence of conflict among relatives, neither happiness nor wealth remains for humans.

**97.** Just as cold touches cause suffering to those afflicted by cold fever, so too do enjoyments cause suffering to humans when they are at odds with their relatives.

**98.** Contemplating this, and abandoning his kingdom, Bahubali took to asceticism and stood motionless on Mount Kailasa, performing the Pratimā Yoga for a year.

**99.** His feet were adorned with serpents, adorned with jewels, emerging from the holes of the anthill, just as they were previously adorned with jewel-adorned kings.

**100.** Just as the tender-bodied Vallhabhā used to embrace his entire body, so too did the tender-bodied Madhavi creeper embrace the entire body of the ascetic Bahubali.

**101.** Two celestial beings kept removing the creeper from his body, so that the dark-complexioned, steadfast, yogi Bahubali shone like a mountain of emeralds.

**102.** Having renounced all passions, and having attained perfect knowledge, Bahubali, who had been saluted by Bharata, became a member of the assembly of Lord Vṛṣabhadeva.

**103.** Possessing fourteen great jewels and nine treasures, the extremely intelligent Chakravarti Bharata, free from rivals, enjoyed the earth without any obstacles.

**104.** Filled with compassion, Bharata, without any testing, gave whatever people desired for twelve years.

**105.** Overwhelmed by the love and devotion for the Jina-doctrine, he tested the Śrāvakas with sprouts of barley and rice, made a three-stringed Yajñopavita, made of the Kākiṇī gem, as their mark, honored them, and gave them devotional gifts in the age of righteousness.

**106.** Then those Brāhmaṇas, who were vowed like Bharata, were declared to be the four-fold varṇa, having been born from the three-fold varṇa of the past.

## Chapter Eleven: The Conquest of the Directions by Bharata

**208**

In the *Harivamsha Purana*, those who were deeply attached to Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha, enjoyed uninterrupted happiness, constantly bewildered by the illusion of the world. 

The Lord, without uttering a word, showed the fruits of their past Dharma to others through his own glory.  Who was not a teacher of Dharma to them? 

**Meaning:** Seeing his unparalleled magnificence, people understood that this was the result of their past Dharma, and therefore everyone should practice Dharma.

**Shārdūlavikridita**

With the greatness of the Jinas, he was a treasure of happiness, a wish-fulfilling tree for all, endowed with great strength, and his mind, like a wheel, was adorned with the jewel of Right Faith.  Like Indra, he was adorned with Lakshmi, and thus the Chakravarti Bharata, with a mind as firm as the roar of a lion, immersed himself in the path of the Jinas.

Thus ends the eleventh chapter of the *Harivamsha Purana*, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which is a collection of the *Arishta-nemi Purana*, and describes the conquest of the directions by Bharata.

Page #247:
---------------------------
The twelfth chapter: Having gone, the Chakravarti constantly paid homage to his Lord. He listened to the sixty-three Puranas in detail. ||1|| He had garlands of homage made, touching the head, for the twenty-four Tirthankaras, at the entrance of his palace. ||2|| The Tirthankaras, unseen before, entered the assembly. The sons of the king, with Vivardhana Kumar at their head, were all of them, in the past, of the wrong view. ||3|| They were distressed, having been born in the bodies of stationary beings, and having been of the wrong view from time immemorial. Seeing the Lord's Lakshmi, the princes were astonished. ||4|| Within a moment, they became well-behaved, and they lived for nine hundred and twenty-three years. ||5|| The Chakravarti praised them, and then, having paid homage to the Jina's teachings and the assembly of the virtuous, he entered the city, delighted. ||6|| Slowly, in time, the king, the protector of the people, whose mind was cleansed by the water of knowledge of the four aims of life, came to rule. ||7|| Then, when the time for the Swayamvara arrived, many earth-dwellers and Vidyadharas gathered in the Swayamvara pavilion. Sulochana, the daughter of Akampana, the king of Banaras, chose Megheshvara Jayakumar, the son of Soma Prabha, the king of Hastinapur, as her husband. ||8|| There was a battle between Arka-Kiti and Jayakumar, in which Jayakumar bound Arka-Kiti. Then, at the urging of Akampana, Jayakumar released Arka-Kiti and performed his funeral rites. The Chakravarti honored Jayakumar, the husband of Sulochana. ||9|| Later, the king of Hastinapur, Jayakumar, was sitting on the roof of his palace, surrounded by women, when he saw the Vidyadharas and Vidyadharis flying through the sky, and he fainted. ||10||

Page #248:
---------------------------
210
The women of the inner palace, having revived him from his swoon, said, "Alas!  Pravahati! Where have you gone?"  ||11||  Seeing the Vidhyadhara and Vidhyadhari, Jayakumar remembered his past life.  Meanwhile, seeing the pair of pigeons playing on the palace balcony, Sulochana also remembered her past life and fainted.  ||12||  After regaining consciousness, Sulochana, having received treatment for her swoon, rose up calling out the name Hiranyavarma.  ||13||  Hearing the name Hiranyavarma from his beloved, Jayakumar said to her, "I was Hiranyavarma before."  Sulochana, delighted, replied, "I am Pravahati."  ||14||  Thus, the couple, through various signs, clearly established that they were Vidhyadharas in their previous lives.  ||15||  Then, to satisfy the curiosity of the people of the inner palace, who were filled with wonder, Jayakumar urged Sulochana to tell the story of their past four lives.  ||16||  She narrated their story, filled with the flavors of joy and sorrow, and interwoven with the happiness of reunion.  ||17||  She told how Uttatikari was related to the couple Sukanta and Rativega, and how she had burned them both, causing their tragic death.  ||18||  Uttatikari, upon dying, became a cat, while Sukanta and Rativega became pigeons.  Uttatikari then devoured the pigeons, causing them great suffering as they died.  ||19||  Through the blessings of the sage's gift, the pigeon's soul became the Vidhyadhari named Pravahati, and the pigeon's soul became the Vidhyadhara named Hiranyavarma.  Both enjoyed the wealth of the Vidhyadharas.  ||20||  Perhaps, while Hiranyavarma and Pravahati were performing austerities in the forest, their former enemy, the cat, in the form of the thief Vidyu dvega, burned them in a fire.  ||21||  Due to the consequences of their karma, Hiranyavarma and Pravahati died and became gods and goddesses in the first heaven, while the thief Vidyu dvega, upon dying, went to hell.  At some point, the couple of gods came to earth for amusement, and Vidyu dvega, having escaped from hell, became the sage Bhima.  ||22||  Thus, the three beings, recognizing each other, forgave each other.  ||23||
Gone.  ||10||

## The Twelfth Chapter

211. Thus, by her own command, Sulochana narrated the story of Sri Pal. Hearing this great tale, Jayakumar was filled with immense wonder. ||24||

25.  Both Jayakumar and Sulochana, who were immersed in the ocean of affection born from their connection across five births, regained their past-life knowledge simply by remembering. ||25||

26.  Then, empowered by their knowledge, they conquered the beauty of the Vidyaadharas and roamed freely in their celestial realm. ||26||

27.  Jayakumar, who nourished the three goals of life (Dharma, Artha, Kama) and always worshipped the Jina, would often roam with Sulochana in the caves of Mount Mandara. ||27||

28.  He would also play with Sulochana, adorned with her ample hips, on the slopes of Kulachala, where the Kinnaras sang. ||28||

29.  Though born in the realm of karma, he, like a skilled couple, enjoyed the pleasures of the realm of enjoyment as he wished. ||29||

30.  Once, inspired by Indra's praise, a deva named Rati Prabha, along with his wife, tested Jayakumar's virtue on Mount Sumeru and, after the test, worshipped him. ||30||

31.  Indeed, among all forms of purity, purity of conduct is the most praiseworthy. Those who are pure in conduct are served even by the gods. ||31||

32.  Jayakumar, adorned with many wives and sons, enjoyed the highest pleasures along with his younger brother Vijay. ||32||

33.  One day, while playing on the mountains with Sulochana, he went to the Samavasarana to worship Sri Vrishabha Jina. ||33||

Seventy Ganadharas, adorned with various auspicious qualities, are present near Rishabhadeva in the Harivamsha Purana. These, starting with Vrishabhasena, are shining near the great Prabhu. ||37|| O beloved! Here, the Kevali, the Jata-dhari, Bahubali, is present. This Muni, having attained the state of liberation, is surrounded by his brothers and shines like a banyan tree surrounded by many trees. ||38|| O Devi! Here, our father, the Muni-raja, Soma-prabhu, adorned with the Lakshmi of tapas, is shining with his younger brother, Shreyans. ||39|| Here, your father, the great king, Akampan, is absorbed in tapas with a thousand sons and is shining with the glory of tapas. ||40|| O beloved! Here, these great kings, starting with Durmarshan, who fought in your swayamvara, are performing tapas with peaceful minds. ||41|| O beloved! This is Brahmi, the foremost of all Aryikas, and this is Sundari. Both of them defeated Kamadeva in their maidenhood. ||42|| Here, Bharat Chakravarti is seated near the Jina, along with many kings, and on the other side, his queens, starting with Subhadra, are present. ||43|| O beloved! Look, look, what a wonder! These, who are mutually hostile, are sitting together like friends. ||44|| Thus, showing the great assembly of the Arhant to his beloved, Sulochana, the knower of dharma, Kumar descended from the sky, praised the Jina, and sat down respectfully near the Chakravarti. Sulochana went and sat near Subhadra. ||45-46|| Jayakumar's moha was very subtle, so he attained the knowledge of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, the three jewels of enlightenment, by hearing the nectar of dharma, which was a detailed story, there. ||47|| Then, the extremely intelligent Jayakumar, breaking the strong bond of affection, explained to Sulochana, gave his kingdom to his son, Anantavirya, and, even though the Chakravarti, who was attached to affection, tried to stop him, he took initiation near the Jina, along with his younger brother, Vijay. ||48-49|| At that time, along with Jayakumar, one hundred and eight kings renounced their wives, sons, friends, and kingdoms and took initiation. ||50|| Sulochana, knowing the nature of the wicked world, took white clothes along with her co-wives, and Brahmi and Sundari also took initiation. ||51||

There was a sevenfold assembly of the great ones, filled with diverse virtues, of the Risis, of Vrishabha. || 71 ||
There were four thousand, seven hundred and fifty great ones, the former holders of the earth. || 72 ||
There were as many thousands, a hundred and fifty thousand, who were called teachers of the scriptures, restrained, with restrained senses. || 73 ||
There were nine thousand Munis, the knowers of the limits, twenty thousand were the knowers of the pure knowledge. || 74 ||
There were twenty thousand, six hundred, who were the possessors of the power of transformation, conquering even Indra by the power of transformation. || 75 ||
There were twelve thousand, seven hundred and fifty, who were filled with vast intellect. || 76 ||
There were as many, counted by number, with countless good qualities, the conquerors, the knowers of the logic of arguments, the debaters, the opponents. || 77 ||
There were fifty thousand pure knowers, the Aryikas, five hundred thousand Shravikas, and three hundred thousand Shravakas. || 78 ||
The Jinesvara, freed from the time of the false, for a hundred thousand years in the past, wandered the earth, saving many from the ocean of existence. || 79 ||
Sragdhara Chanda
Having done this, the Lord, capable of rescuing from the ocean of existence, established the Mahavati Tirtha, a field Tirtha, beneficial to the three worlds, lasting until the end of the Kalpa, to establish it. The Lord, naturally, like a tree climbing, with the feet of the Shramanas, worthy of worship, like the sun, the Lord Vrishabha, with great brilliance, ascended the mountain Kailasa, like the mountain Nishadha. || 80 ||
On that mountain, the Jinesvara, seated in a beautiful network of crystal stones, with ten thousand Yogis, performed the restraint of the Yogas. Having done this, at the end, the destruction of the four great karmas, the Lord, with pure garlands, worshipped by the Devas, went to the place, the place, the Siddha. || 81 ||

In the assembly of Devaki, there was a sevenfold assembly of Munis, filled with diverse virtues. || 71 ||
Among them, four thousand, seven hundred and fifty great ones were the former holders of the earth. || 72 ||

## The Twelfth Canto

The silent assembly of the monks, the group of gods, and the kings led by the Chakravarti, all gathered together with great devotion. They worshipped the body of the Trijagadguru, Devadi Deva, Vrishabhadeva, with fragrant flowers, incense, bright akshata, and shining lamps. They bowed down and requested the auspicious fruit of the qualities of Vrishabha Jinendra. || 82 ||

Thus ends the twelfth canto of the Harivamsa, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which describes the Nirvana of Vrishabhesvara, and is a collection of the Arishtanemi Purana. || 12 ||

## The Thirteenth Chapter

Having enjoyed Lakshmi for a long time, the king, Bharateshwara, the lord of the earth, crowned his son, Arka-kirti, and himself embraced the Jain initiation, a difficult and arduous path of self-control, a net to capture the wild, unruly herd of senses. 1-2.

Gautama Swami says, "O King Shrenik! Maharaja Bharat uprooted all his five senses and his karmic bonds were so quickly extinguished that he attained Kevala Jnana (omniscience) immediately after shedding his hair and nails." 3.

## Chapter 13: The Lineage of Ikshvaku

**218**

Sagara, the king, was a chakravarti (universal monarch). He was the master of inexhaustible treasures and jewels, and was as famous as Bharata Chakravarti. **27**

He had sixty thousand sons, all of whom were descendants of Adgu. These sons were all endowed with extraordinary abilities and were filled with great joy for each other. **28**

Once, all the brothers went to Mount Kailasa. There, they built eight platforms and began to dig the earth with a vajra (thunderbolt). However, the Naga king, angered by their actions, turned them all to ashes. **29**

Sagara, the chakravarti, was a knower of the state of the world. Therefore, he renounced his grief over his sons and took initiation from Ajitanatha Bhagwan. He was freed from the bonds of karma and attained liberation. **30**

After Ajitanatha, came Sambhavanatha, followed by Abhinandanatha, then Sumatinatha, then Padma Prabhu, then Suparshvanatha, then Chandra Prabhu, then Pushpadanta, and finally Shitalanatha. **31-32**

Gautama Swami said to King Shrenik, "O Shrenik! The Ikshvaku dynasty was the first to arise. From the Ikshvaku dynasty, the Surya dynasty and the Chandra dynasty were born. At the same time, the Kuru dynasty, the Ugra dynasty, and many other dynasties flourished. In the beginning, there were no rishis (sages) on the earth, but later, many rishis arose after taking initiation from Bhagwan Rishabhadeva. Their noble Shri dynasty flourished. Thus, I have described to you the lineages of many kings and vidyadharas (celestial beings). **33**

Now, during the time of Shitalanatha Bhagwan's pure and radiant tenth tirthankara (liberated soul), when the world was illuminated by the lamp of pure knowledge, and when Indra and the gods were coming into the world, the lineage of the Haris, who were endowed with great power, manifested. I will describe that lineage as well. O King! Listen to the true account of this lineage in the path of the Jinas. **34**

Thus ends the thirteenth chapter of the Harivansha Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which contains the lineage of Ikshvaku, and is part of the collection of the Arishtanemi Purana. **13**

1. Adgu was the name of the eldest son.

## Chapter Fourteen: The Land of Vatsa

There is a land called Vatsa, among other lands. It takes on the form of a calf when the milkmen milk the cows. ||1||

Kaushambi, the city, with its palaces reflected in the smooth, blue waters of the Yamuna, shone like the deep navel of Vatsa. ||2||

Adorned with ramparts, walls, and moats, and draped in the sky, the city appeared like a woman burdened by the weight of her hips and breasts. ||3||

Like a mature courtesan, she wore a garment adorned with jewels, and touched the clouds, filled with fresh water, like a lover touching the face of their beloved in the night. ||4||

Or, like a virtuous wife in the dark fortnight, she remained untouched by the rays of the moon, which are like the hands of a wicked man. And just as a virtuous wife shines brightly with her jeweled ornaments amidst the many faults of other women, so too did the city shine with the brilliance of its jeweled ornaments in the dark fortnight. ||5||

The king, the lord of this city, was named Sumukha. Like the sun, he was the source of great power. Just as the sun fills the sky with its rays, so too did the king fill the land with his taxes. ||6||

Page #258:
---------------------------
220
In the Harivamsha Purana, it is said that King Sumukh's bow, which was capable of eliminating the defects of Varna Sankara (caste mixing), surpassed the bow of Indra in its qualities.  The bow of Indra was unable to eliminate the defects of Varna Sankara, which are caused by the mixing of different colors (red, yellow, blue, green, etc.).  [7]

King Sumukh's body was extremely beautiful due to his youthful radiance and the presence of the goddess of fortune.  How could even the god of love, whose form is not visible, be compared to him in beauty? [8]

He was skilled in the interpretation of Dharma Shastra, possessed exceptional skills and qualities, was capable of punishing the wicked and rewarding the virtuous, and was a true protector of his people. [9]

He was like a bee in a lotus garden, the garden being his inner palace, and he honored the seasons as they arrived, without causing any harm to Dharma, Artha, or Kama (righteousness, wealth, and desire). [10]

Then came the spring season, which seemed to be just like King Sumukh.  Just as King Sumukh was full of energy and enthusiasm, so too was the spring season, eager to display its splendor.  Just as King Sumukh was capable of captivating the heart of a woman named Vanamala with his flowers and leaves, so too was the spring season captivating with its beautiful forests adorned with flowers and leaves. [11]

Mango trees, which captivate the hearts of men, were adorned with new leaves of a reddish hue, as if they were announcing the love of Vanamala (the forest) for King Sumukh. [12]

The flame-colored Palash trees were shining brightly, as if they were the flames of love that had been extinguished by the reunion of lovers after a long separation. [13]

The Ashoka tree, a young man, was adorned with new leaves, as if he had been touched by the soft footsteps of a beautiful woman wearing anklets that made a tinkling sound. [14]

The Bakul tree, whose trunk was full of the nectar of unadulterated wine, filled the hearts of women with its flowers. [15]

The Karavaka, which produced a pleasant sound for happy young women, was also a source of comfort for the sorrowful young men. [16]

Just as the sun is associated with happiness and the best of the sky, so too was the king associated with happiness and prosperity. [6]

King Sumukh's bow, with its qualities, had surpassed the bow of Indra, which was unable to eliminate the defects of Varna Sankara. [7]

The god of love, whose form is not visible, could not be compared to King Sumukh in beauty. [8]

King Sumukh was skilled in the interpretation of Dharma Shastra, possessed exceptional skills and qualities, was capable of punishing the wicked and rewarding the virtuous, and was a true protector of his people. [9]

He honored the seasons as they arrived, without causing any harm to Dharma, Artha, or Kama. [10]

The spring season seemed to be just like King Sumukh, full of energy and enthusiasm, captivating with its beautiful forests adorned with flowers and leaves. [11]

Mango trees, adorned with new leaves of a reddish hue, seemed to be announcing the love of Vanamala (the forest) for King Sumukh. [12]

The flame-colored Palash trees were shining brightly, as if they were the flames of love that had been extinguished by the reunion of lovers after a long separation. [13]

The Ashoka tree, a young man, was adorned with new leaves, as if he had been touched by the soft footsteps of a beautiful woman wearing anklets that made a tinkling sound. [14]

The Bakul tree, whose trunk was full of the nectar of unadulterated wine, filled the hearts of women with its flowers. [15]

The Karavaka, which produced a pleasant sound for happy young women, was also a source of comfort for the sorrowful young men. [16]

Just as the sun is associated with happiness and the best of the sky, so too was the king associated with happiness and prosperity. [6]

Caturdasah sargah
17. The blossoming tilaka flowers, which were the glory of the tilaka trees, made the forest-goddess, who was fragrant like the patala flower, extremely full of flowers.
18. Just as the mane of the lion, the king of beasts, shines with glory when he is eager to conquer, so the mane of the Sinhika tree shone with glory as it sought to conquer the cluster of nagapunnaga trees.
19. The month of Caitra quickly nourished and made the jasmine, who was withered due to long separation, full of flowers, just as a lover quickly nourishes and makes his beloved, who was emaciated due to long separation, full of flowers.
20. The women, who were intoxicated with the raga of the swing-song, sang softly while engrossed in the swing-dance.
21. Some female companions went to the garden groves and, out of affection, indulged in a series of drinking (parties).
22. The deer first tasted the sprout of the dūrvā grass and then gave it to the doe. She too tasted it and gave it back to him, for what is smelled by the beloved is dear.
23. The she-elephant, blinded by the pleasure of the touch of his trunk, made the she-elephant who was eager for the tender shoots of the sallaki tree.
24. Intoxicated with the madness of drinking honey, the pairs of bees buzzed loudly as they eagerly smelled one another in the blossoming honey.
25. Hearing the song of the cuckoos with melodious throats, the cuckoo sang, as if out of a desire to nourish and cherish that (song).
26. Where the bees, intoxicated with honey, and the clamorous cuckoos sang sweetly, what talk could there be of others?

Here is the English translation, preserving the Jain terms:

In the Harivamsha Purana, it is said that when the delightful month of Chaitra arrived, the king Sumukha turned his mind towards forest-wandering, filled with the intoxication of love [27]. One day, adorned with various ornaments, riding an elephant, with his resplendent umbrella covering the disc of the sun, the king, like the flow of rivers merging into the ocean, accompanied by many other kings and praised by a group of bards, proceeded on the royal path [28-29]. The women of the city, eager to behold him, who was ever present in their hearts like the spring season, became agitated [30]. Raising their hands in reverence, they chanted "Grow, conquer, rejoice!", and with their eyes clouded by love, they drank in the king's beauty [31]. Amidst those women, the king spotted one woman of exceptional beauty, who appeared like the goddess Rati herself [32]. He gazed upon her lotus-like face, lotus-like eyes, coral-like lips, conch-like neck, slender waist, deep navel, beautiful hips, tender thighs and calves, and delicate hands and feet [33-34]. The king, overwhelmed with intense passion, was unable to withdraw his gaze fixed upon her alluring form [35]. He contemplated, "Whose is this woman who, with the noose of her beauty, has captivated my heart? Like a charming doe, she joyfully attracts me" [36]. He thought, "If I do not enjoy this heart-stealing woman, then my sovereignty, beauty, and youth are all in vain" [37]. "This world is ever difficult to transgress, and the desire for other's wives is unbearable" [38]. Thus, pondering, the king set his mind to abducting her. For, the reproach can be borne, but not the anguish of the mind [39]. Though his fame was shining, he was overcome by great infatuation. For, even the luminous sun is obscured at the time of its setting [40].

## English Translation:

**224**

The minister, named Samati, asked the king in private, with respect, "My lord, why are you distressed today? Please tell me." ||53||

"My lord, this is your sole kingdom, the people are devoted to you, and other kings are subdued by your love and prowess, becoming your servants." ||54||

"You have satisfied all the petitioners by granting their desired objects, and you have honored all the women with your affection and grace." ||55||

"Nothing is unattainable for you in dharma, artha, or kama. So, my lord, why is your mind troubled, even though you have all kinds of prosperity?" ||56||

"It is the way of the world that people become happy by sharing their mental sorrow with a friend who is as dear as life." ||57||

"Therefore, my lord, tell me, I will fulfill your desire today. For when the lord is happy, all the people are happy." ||58||

Thus addressed, the king immediately said, "Today, while going to the garden, I saw a woman who was not my wife. She captivated me as quickly as knowledge." ||59||

"She was such, her attire was such, and she clearly expressed her intention with her gestures. You must have seen her too." ||60||

Hearing this, the minister said, "My lord, I have seen her, indeed I have seen her. She is the wife of the merchant Veerak, named Vanamala." ||61||

The king said, "If I do not have union with her today, I believe neither my life nor that of the woman with the crooked eyebrows, Vanamala, will be saved." ||62||

"It seems she cannot stay even a day without me, and I too cannot stay a day without her. Therefore, quickly find a way for this." ||63||

"Although I will gain disgrace in this life and misfortune in the next, a foolish man, like one blind from birth, does not see the consequences of his actions." ||64||

"Therefore, even though I am inclined towards this wrong action, I cannot be stopped by you. If I live, there will be many ways to atone for my sin." ||65||

Although the king's words were unjust, the minister, who is the protector against great calamities, accepted them. ||66||

**225** The minister, bowing low, said, "O Lord, this is most auspicious. I have made this garland for you to wear on your neck." **6** "Please bathe and eat as usual. Apply divine unguents, wear fine clothes, chew betel, and adorn yourself with garlands." **68** Thus, having bowed and made his request, the minister, with his eyes of wisdom, knew that the Lord, though averse to eating without the garland, would do as he wished. **69** Knowing the intention of the Lord, the sun, as if out of compassion, contracted his rays and moved towards the west. **70** When the sun, the mighty friend of the world, with his brilliance diminished, began to set, all the energetic people became devoid of energy. **71** Just as the swans, with their eyes, pull the sun down, so too, the sun, somehow, slowly disappeared. **72** Then, as if the whole world was filled with the redness of the evening, so too, the heart of the Lord, Su-mukha, was filled with the love of the garland. **73** Then, the lotus buds, whose brilliance was shattered, became contracted. For who, in the time of a friend's misfortune, can flourish? **74** As darkness, seeking the redness of the evening, covered the world, it seemed as if the world, having shed its red garment, had donned a blue one. **75** Just as, in the uneven time of the evening, when darkness, like a thief, has enveloped the world, even learned men cannot discern the different classes of people, so too, at the beginning of the evening, when darkness had overwhelmed the world, learned men could not discern the different classes of people. **76**

**Note:** The translation preserves the Jain terms "Su-mukha" and "Mantra" as they are important to the story.

In the Harivamsha Purana, the minister, Velaya, sent a messenger, Atreyi, to Vanamala, with the king Sumukha's order. ||77|| Vanamala honored the messenger with a seat and other gifts, making her happy. Then, the wise messenger spoke to Vanamala in private, saying, "My dear daughter Vanamala, you seem troubled today. Tell me the reason for your sadness. Has your husband angered you?" ||78-79|| "You are the only wife of Veeraka, so what could be the reason for his anger? There must be some other reason that is troubling you. Tell me." ||80|| "Daughter, you have tested me many times in all matters. What could be difficult for you while I am here?" ||81|| Hearing this, Vanamala sighed heavily, her lips trembling. After being urged repeatedly, she spoke with great sorrow, "Mother, I have no one else to confide in except you. A secret that reaches six ears is bound to be revealed, so it must be protected carefully. ||82-83|| The truth is, I saw King Sumukha today, with his handsome face and beautiful features. The moment I saw him, Kamadeva entered my heart." ||84|| "My heart is behaving like the heart of a wicked person, desiring what is unattainable and hating what is easily available. Just as a wicked person desires what is rare and hates what is easily available, my heart desires King Sumukha, who is completely unattainable for me, and hates what is easily available." ||85|| "My heart is drying up even after being anointed with sandalwood paste. What can external remedies do for internal problems?" ||86|| "Even a wet cloth placed on my limbs and body dries up. What can a little cold touch do on something extremely hot?" ||87|| "Even a bed made of soft leaves for a person with a rough body will wither away. What can a little cold touch do for him?" ||88|| "I cannot find peace without touching his body. Therefore, O pure one, please have mercy and bring about his union with me soon." ||89||

10. Believe me, her mental state is also mixed with my desire due to my sight. It is clearly evident from all her actions.
11. O skilled one! You should secretly unite these two distressed lovers, for the distressed can be united with the distressed only.
12. Hearing the words of Vanamala that conveyed her feelings, the messenger, filled with joy, spoke.
13. "O child! The lord of your land, Ragana Sumukha, whose heart has been stolen by your beauty, has sent me. Come, I shall quickly unite you with him."
14. Thus, in accordance with her desired objective, the love-afflicted Vanamala, in the absence of her husband, quickly entered the royal palace with the messenger.
15. Seeing the heart-stealing Sumukhi, the king Sumukha became delighted and affectionately welcomed her.
16. The young man, taking her hand that had touched her breasts, made her sit on his own bed.

**Fast and Slow Verse**

Then, touched by the fragrant wind that had brushed against the lotus forest, the couple, their fatigue dispelled, embraced each other, their embrace loose and languid. ||1||

Awakened on a bed of soft, undulating waves, adorned with a mass of crushed flowers,  Sumukh, with his beloved Vanamala, shone like a young, playful swan on a sandy shore. ||2||

Just as the hearts of separated swans cannot bear the poison of separation even for a moment, so too, the hearts of these beloved bride and groom, with their captivating gestures, could not bear the poison of separation even for a moment. ||3||

Therefore, King Sumukh did not send Vanamala back to her husband's house, but kept her in his own home.  Indeed, those who have tasted the sweetness of a rare treasure do not relinquish it. ||4||

Vanamala, with her exquisite beauty, had attained preeminence among all the chief women of King Sumukh, and had achieved supreme glory.  Indeed, what is unattainable when one is in harmony with one's husband? ||5||

Then, at some point, like an unexpected treasure, the venerable Muni Vardharma, a repository of great austerities, arrived at King Sumukh's palace.  Indeed, guests arrive only when great merit arises. ||6||

The Muni possessed a pure intellect, a clear vision, and profound knowledge of many things.  His body was purified by his character, marked by the utmost purity of vows, secrecy, and self-control.  He was adorned with the spotless wealth of austerities like fasting and study, and his complexion was white... ||7||

1. Greatness.
2. Captivating gestures.
3. In harmony.

In the Harivamsha Purana, he was adorned with the brilliance of a white, pure, and peaceful old age, free from all defilements, and with a vast, pure stream of karma, generating glory. || 8 || Having conquered the vices, passions, and endurance, and having well controlled the activities of the senses, the king, Su-mukha, seeing the great ascetic, Su-mukha, arrive at his home, immediately stood up. || 9 || His mind overwhelmed with joy, he went to him, accompanied by his wife, and after circumambulating the pure ascetic, he respectfully received him and seated him on the pure, jeweled floor. || 10 || Then, with his beloved wife holding a golden pitcher, he washed the feet of the ascetic with water free from impurities. || 11 || Then, with fragrant sandalwood, auspicious grains, offerings, lamps, incense, and other auspicious materials, he worshipped him with his mind, speech, and body, and then gave him gifts with joy. || 12 || At that time, the karmic results of Su-mukha and Vanamala were equal, so they both made a great, virtuous bond that would bring them the fruits of enjoyment in the next life, a bond that would destroy all sins. || 13 || The ascetic, who had observed a fast for many days, performed the breaking of the fast for the sake of his emaciated body, and who was the cause of happiness for those who gave, and who was extremely skilled in the contemplation of truth, went to the forest. || 14 || Then, the king, Su-mukha, who was enjoying the fruits of his good deeds, and who was constantly repenting for the sin of abducting another man's wife, was constantly experiencing happiness, free from harm, and at some point, he lay down with his beloved wife, Vanamala, who was like a garland of virtues. || 16 ||

And when the two, endowed with excellent minds and excellent lifespans, were about to reach their maturity, then, due to the decree of time, a cloud laden with lightning arrived and struck them. ||17||

Their lives, extinguished by the lightning strike, were consumed by the fruits of their great charity. The two, victorious in their speech, were elevated to the state of celestial beings, enjoying great happiness. ||18||

The ocean, touching both shores, is adorned with the whiteness of the moon and the milky ocean. This is why the celestial being, with his form radiating darkness, is like a large garland worn by the earth. ||19||

He, surpassing the sky, travels ten yojanas above the earth, sustaining the cities of the celestial kings with his two divisions, which appear like new realms of enjoyment in the world. ||20||

This mountain, holding dominion over all the mountains of the Bharat region, has one hundred and ten beautiful cities situated on it. It is twenty-five yojanas wide and brings forth happiness. ||21||

On the northern range of this mountain, there is a city called Haripura, capable of bestowing all kinds of happiness. It is adorned with forests of various trees, resembling the earth of Uttarakuru and appearing like Indrapuri in its splendor. ||22||

The protector of this city was the celestial being Pavanagiri. He was the father of the celestial being, King Sumukh, and his mother was Mrigavati, skilled in many arts and virtues. ||23||

Here, the celestial being Sumukh, bearing the meaningful name "Aaya," gradually began to speak words like nectar, bringing joy to the Aryans. He remembered his former wife. ||24||

## Chapter 232

In the northern region of the Harivansha Purana, there is a city called Meghapur, situated on a mountain named Vimva. This city is adorned with an endless line of magnificent mansions made of precious gems. ||25||

The king of Meghapur was Pavanavega, who was like a lion in his ability to destroy the pride of enemy elephants. His beloved wife was Manohari, who captivated her husband's heart during their moments of love. She was as dear to him as love itself. ||26||

From this union, a daughter named Manorama was born, a virtuous and beautiful woman who brought joy to her father, King Sumukh. Manorama was aware of her past lives and brought happiness to the world like the moon's radiance. ||27||

Their marriage was arranged according to the auspicious traditions of their noble families. The divine will ensured that their children would be born soon, as it always strived to bring together such auspicious souls. ||28||

The two children, a boy and a girl, were raised with love and care in their respective homes. They would sometimes cover their eyes with their hands, sometimes smile softly, sometimes eagerly speak, and sometimes fill the air with their laughter, bringing joy to their families. ||29||

These two children, radiant like the sun and fire, were blessed with the auspicious fortune of enjoying the pleasures of life. Their presence brought joy and prosperity to their families, just as children bring happiness to their parents. ||30||

This pair, with bodies as bright as the moon, grew stronger and more beautiful with each passing day, adorned with various arts and skills. Their families, like a vast ocean of joy, grew even more expansive with their flourishing. ||31||

This couple, knowledgeable about the world, was adorned with all the knowledge mastered by the celestial beings. Their youthful beauty, enhanced by their numerous virtues, captivated the hearts of all who beheld them. ||32||

The Fifteenth Canto

Then, the young prince, like the lord of birds, united with that lotus-like celestial maiden in accordance with the proper rituals of the auspicious marriage ceremony, as per the customs of their community. ||33||

He experienced lasting happiness with her, who was endowed with the playful gestures of love. She was trained in the dramatic arts and was the dancer-preceptor of the god of love. ||34||

Sometimes, he sported with his most beloved one in the charming cave-like recesses of the divine damsels, on the Mandara mountain. At other times, he reveled with her for a long time in the pleasure grove, amidst the fragrant divine trees and sandalwood. ||35||

At times, he enjoyed passionate love with his beloved on the banks of the lakes and rivers of the Kulachala mountain range. At other times, he experienced love even in the trees of the pleasure groves. ||36||

Thus, the couple residing on the victorious mountain, enjoyed the divine pleasures in their city, resounding with the ankle-bells of the celestial damsels - a pleasure that is so rare and difficult to attain on earth, and which was effortlessly bestowed upon them. ||37||

Thereafter, the merchant Vīraka, deprived of his beloved Vanamalā, was afflicted with the sorrow of separation and could find no peace, not even on the soft, cool couch of tender leaves. ||38||

The moon with its rays could not alleviate the burning in his heart, just as the yogi, though surrounded by water, remains thirsty. Like the separated chakravāka bird on earth, he was always tormented by the pangs of separation. ||39||

Then, that controlled Vīraka, having endured the anguish of separation for a long time, took refuge in the teachings of the Jina, which is the supreme refuge for those seeking shelter. ||40||

Page #272:

23. In the Harivamsha Purana, it is described that he (the Jain ascetic) performed severe penance, which emaciated his body and crushed the lust of the mind. It nourished the ocean of bliss of the Agama-desa (the region of the Agamas) and pleased the first Kalpa (heavenly abode) of the immortals. ||41||

He was adorned with all kinds of ornaments and his form was decorated with all kinds of jewellery. He was immersed in the nectar-like ocean of the happiness of the devas and was established in the essence of various emotions and sentiments. ||42||

Once, in the celestial realm, he came across the group of excellent celestial maidens and, being familiar with his past relationship, he focused his Avadhi-jnana (clairvoyant knowledge) on a particular woman, Vanamala. ||43||

Reflecting on the defeat inflicted on him by King Sumukha earlier, and then opening his Avadhi-cakshu (clairvoyant vision), he beheld the couple of Vidyadharas (celestial beings) engaged in amorous play. ||44||

He contemplated that the wicked Sumukha, who had earlier overpowered him and snatched away his beloved, was now enjoying intimacy with the same woman in this life as well. ||45||

He wondered whether it was worthwhile to use his mighty powers against the mindless Sumukha, who had already been defeated, since doubling the punishment for the enemy may not be justified. ||46||

Filled with anger and determined to take revenge, the radiant deva descended swiftly from the heavens to the earth. ||47||

By chance, he came upon the son of the Khechara (celestial) king, Sumukha's attendant, who was enjoying himself in the Harivarsya region. ||48||

## The Fifteenth Chapter

**235**

Seeing the Vidhyadhara couple, whose bodies were filled with the bloom of youth, the Dev, with his inherent, unbroken Maya, made them *Khandit-Vidya*, that is, he took away their knowledge. **49**

And, filled with anger, he said to them, "Oh, you, the foremost of those who steal other's wives, do you remember your valiant enemy, the *Veerak*? And you, the wicked *Vanmala*, who have broken your vows from past lives, do you remember him too?" **50**

"I have become a Dev through penance, and you both have become Vidhyadharas through the fruits of the Munidan. In your previous lives, you caused me pain, so I too will cause you pain by destroying your knowledge." **51**

Saying this, the Dev, like Garuda lifting birds, took the Vidhyadhara and Vidhyadhari, whose minds were filled with wonder and whose bodies trembled with fear, and flew with them towards the southern region of Bharat. **52**

At that time, the king of Champapuri, Chandrakeet, was dead, and the city was without a king. The Dev brought the Vidhyadhara there and made him the king of Champapuri, worshipped by many kings, and then went to heaven. **53**

The Vidhyadhara couple, whose knowledge had been destroyed by the Dev, were unable to fly in the sky, like birds with broken wings. They gave up their desire to fly and found contentment on earth. **54**

This incident took place in the Tirtha of the tenth Tirthankara, Shitalnath, who had a body ninety bows tall and had lived for a hundred thousand years in the past. At that time, his Tirtha was moving at a speed of a little more than a hundred oceans less than a crore oceans. **55**

King Arya, with his powerful arm, subdued all the kings, making them submissive and obedient. He enjoyed worldly pleasures with his beloved Manorama, who had unwavering love, for a long time, but still, he was not satisfied. **56**

Later, they had a son named Hari, who was known as... **57**

## Chapter Fifteen: The Origin of the Harivaṃśa

**236**

In the Harivaṃśa Purāṇa, Hari was the first to arise, a beacon of glory, from the Harivaṃśa lineage. The world knows him by the name Harivaṃśa, as the scriptures declare. ||58||

Hari had a son named Mahāgiri. Mahāgiri had a son named Himagiri, a follower of righteous conduct. Himagiri had a son named Vasugiri, and Vasugiri had a son named Giri. All of them attained heaven and liberation in due course. ||59||

After them, there were hundreds of kings, like Indra, who adorned the Harivaṃśa lineage. They ruled vast kingdoms and bore the burden of austerity. Some attained liberation, while others ascended to heaven. ||60||

After the passing of many kings, a king named Sumitra, a descendant of Hari, ruled the Magadha country. He was the lord of Kuśala-maṅgala and Kuśāgrapur. His valor was adorned by his profound knowledge of the scriptures. He ruled the earth for a long time, enjoying happiness with his beloved Padmavati, a devoted Jain. ||61-62||

Thus ends the fifteenth chapter of the Harivaṃśa Purāṇa, composed by Jinaseṇa Ācārya, which narrates the origin of the Harivaṃśa, included in the collection of the Ariṣṭanemi Purāṇa. ||15||

## The Sixteenth Chapter

**In the Vasantatilaka metre**

After the Tirthankara Shitalnath, nine Tirthankaras will successively establish the Dharma in the Bharat Kshetra for the benefit of the world's beings. In due course, the twentieth Tirthankara will attain liberation and descend from heaven. ||1||

By the command of Indra, Kubera daily fills the house of King Sumitra with a stream of exquisite jewels. At the end of the night, Queen Padmavati, lying on a soft bed, saw sixteen dreams: 1. Elephant, 2. Bull, 3. Lion, 4. Lakshmi, 5. Garland of flowers, 6. Moon, 7. Young Sun, 8. Fish, 9. Pitcher, 10. Lotus pond, 11. Ocean, 12. Throne, 13. Divine chariot, 14. Serpent King's palace, 15. Heap of jewels, and 16. Fire. ||2-3||

Adorned by ninety-nine Dikkamari goddesses, who possess unparalleled divine radiance, the Tirthankara mother Padmavati, upon waking, sat on a bed of fruits. She appeared as radiant as the moon adorned with stars in the sky. ||4||

With lotus-like eyes, face, hands, and feet, filled with love and joy, and holding a white lotus in her hand, Queen Padmavati approached King Sumitra, seated on a high throne in the morning. She seemed like a terrestrial lotus adorned with many lotuses, approaching the Sun, Sumitra, on the eastern horizon. ||5||

She was adorned with various garments like water, her anklets jingled like the chirping of birds, her eyes were like fish, and her body was adorned with waves like the Trivali. This river-like woman approached the ocean-like King Sumitra. This was indeed fitting. ||6||

With her breasts heavy, her body bent like a staff, her arms soft like tender branches, and adorned with jewels, this young woman, like a creeper, bowed to the King, who was like a wish-fulfilling tree. ||7||

**13.**  Just as the earth is adorned with the blue sapphire, so too was Padmavati adorned with the auspicious marks and the radiance of the blue-throated Muni Suvrata.

**14.**  The thrones and crowns of the three world-Indras trembled, and they, having quickly employed their knowledge of the future, understood the birth of the Jina. The rest of the gods, with great wonder, proclaimed the birth of the Jina with the sounds of bells, drums, kettledrums, and conch shells.

**15.**  Filled with fragrant water, gentle wind, and showers of flowers, the entire world was filled.  Indra and the other gods, adorned with the most brilliant ornaments, quickly circumambulated the great city of Kusagra.

**16.**  Having bowed to the Jina and his parents, the gods and asuras performed the birth rites.  The divine maidens, having placed the Jina on the back of Airavata, carried him with great splendor to the summit of Mount Meru.

**17.**  Having circumambulated Mount Meru, they placed the Jina on a throne made of white stone, atop the mountain.  They then performed his ablution with the pure water of the ocean of milk, adorned him with various ornaments, and praised him with hymns, naming him Muni Suvrata.

**18.**  Bringing skilled ministers, they placed the Jina in the lap of his mother and performed a joyous play.  Then, Indra and the other gods, having bowed to the Jina and his parents, who brought joy to the three worlds, returned to their respective places.

**19.**  The Jina, adorned with three innate eyes of knowledge, with large and generous eyes, was served by the divine princes.  Kubera, who was always attentive to the Jina's well-being, provided him with all the comforts and necessities, and the Jina's body and qualities grew.

**Meaning:** As the Jina's body grew, so too did his:
1.  **Raga** (attachment)
2.  **Mriga** (deer)
3.  **Ganda** (smell)
4.  **Jina** (parents)
5.  **Sharira** (body)

1. Ramyanganas, who were born from the family mountains, were continuously rising in their youth, beauty, and middle age.

2. Having obtained the youthful Gunisuvrata, the lord, they (the Ramyanganas) surrounded him like rivers surrounding the ocean before marriage.

3. The king, who was established on the throne, was like the sun in the sky of the Harivamsha, the protector of the lotus-like subjects, and the one whose lotus feet were worshipped by the gods.

4. He (the king) enjoyed the pleasures of the senses for a long time, being free from any command.

5. Then, at some point, the one with the beauty of the autumn lotus arrived, resembling a new bride after the departure of the rainy season bride.

6. The cloud-like mass, which had quickly silenced its sound, seemed to have hidden itself in the loud sound of the white-colored cowherds' settlements, and the sun, freed from the obstruction of the clouds, was able to enjoy the comfort of spreading its rays.

7. The river-like women, whose waist-garments had slipped down due to the waves, who were beautiful with their whirlpool-like navels, fish-like restless eyes, and wave-like playful arms, captivated his mind during the sports.

8. The waves were their eyebrows, the fish were their restless glances, they were delightful with the sounds of intoxicated bees and swans, and the pollen of the blooming lotuses was their body color - such lotus-pond-like women aroused his passion during the sports.

The fragrant paddy plants, bent low with the weight of their fruit, and the rows of blooming lotuses, born in the paddy fields, both, captivated by the fragrance of auspiciousness, were as if sniffing each other's faces, their limbs touching each other. **26**

The swarms of bees, their bodies adorned with the pollen of the blooming Kadamba flowers, and their hearts filled with sorrow for the absence of the Kadamba nectar, were now seeking pleasure in the vast forests of the Saptaparna trees, intoxicated by the fragrance of the rutting elephant king. **27**

At that time, the great sage, Munisuvrata, the king of swans, was seated on his lofty palace, resembling Mount Kailasa, observing the beautiful swan queens, their faces flushed with shyness and fear, who had banished the splendor of love with their playful antics. **28**

Gazing at the directions, adorned with the beauty of all the autumnal crops, he saw a cloud, white like the moon, resplendent with brilliance, and descending like the elephant king, Airavata, thirsty for the ocean of the sky, eager to roam. **29**

Seeing that cloud, from which all its watery garments had slipped, vast and white, like the full breasts of a woman, and adorning the sky like a jewel, he was filled with joy. **30**

Then, seeing that cloud, its parts quickly dissolving, destroyed by the fierce onslaught of the wind, like a lump of butter melting near a flame, the lord of the world, Munisuvrata, pondered. **31**

How quickly has this autumn cloud vanished? It seems as if it is giving a universal lesson to the world, reminding them of the impermanence of life, body, and form, and the forgetfulness of the human mind. **32**

In the Harivamsha Purana, the mass of atoms collected by the force of their own transformations is 'worthless'. Due to the mere passage of time and the fall of weapons, this life-form quickly goes to destruction. ||33||
Bound by the joints of the diamond-like body, this cloud-like excellent body of the embodied beings becomes powerless due to the burden of the wind of destruction. ||34||
The shadow of the body-cloud of the one who is the ornament of the beauty, youth and prosperity, and who rains the nectar on the minds and eyes of the people of the earth, quickly undergoes the transformation of old age due to the onslaught of time. ||35||
Even the mountain-like peaks of the prosperity and enjoyment of the royal lions who have conquered the oceans and protected the lands for a long time, are crushed to powder by the thunderbolts of time at intervals. ||36||
The beloved wife, the friend and the son, who are equal to the life-breath, go through the separation from the dear ones in this world, just as a dry leaf is blown away by the unseen wind. ||37||
Seeing even for a moment the transitory nature of the limbs and other parts of the body, this mortal, whose vision is covered by the darkness of delusion, abandons the desired path and enters the pit of sense objects. ||38||
This mortal, whose every limb is connected with the intoxicated elephant-like senses, touches the bodies of the beloved women, and being deprived of the joy of touch, suffers the painful bondage like the intoxicated elephant. ||39||

The path of satisfaction is obstructed by the fragrance pleasing to the sense of smell, just as the six-legged one (insect) is obstructed by the strength of its legs. Smelling the fragrance of the poisonous flower, the unintelligent one quickly goes to destruction, just as the six-legged one (insect). (41)
The one with skill in melting the mind, with a slightly smiling face and eyes fixed on the limbs of the beloved woman, even the one fond of beauty, experiences intense anguish, like the moth reaching the flame. (42)
The human being, whose mind is stolen by the sweet sounds of the ornaments, girdles, and various decorations of his beloved, and by her sweet speeches, dies like a deer by the senses, being bereft of courage. (43)
It is amazing that the noble ones, though deeply immersed in the mire of sense pleasures, are not destroyed; and it is even more amazing that the continuous lineage of the Punnāga tree, with a thunderbolt-like body, sinks deep into it. (44)
How can the tiny drop of water on a blade of grass, which has drunk the vast ocean of heavenly pleasures for a very long time and yet has not attained satisfaction, provide satisfaction to him (the human being) with its brief stay in the world of happiness? (45)
There is no satisfaction for the living being here, even with the accumulation of worldly pleasures, just as there is no satisfaction for the fire with a huge pile of fuel, or for the ocean with the constant flow of thousands of rivers. (46)
For the increase of the cluster of flames of the fire of desire for sense objects, there is indeed a huge pile of fuel; but the withdrawal from the senses, which is the cause of its pacification, is the steady flow of water here. (47)
Therefore, abandoning the unreal happiness of the senses, I quickly strive on the path of liberation, which has the primary goal of one's own welfare, and then the establishment of the supreme path of others' welfare, which is the truth. (48)

Thus, in the Harivamsha Purana, the Self-Existent Lord, endowed with the eyes of knowledge, faith, and perception, became self-enlightened.  The thrones of all the gods, from the lowest to the highest, trembled at his awakening. ||49||
The Laukantika gods, adorned with beautiful earrings and garlands, serene, radiant white, and led by Sarasvata, arrived, bowed their heads, and offered flowers, praising the Jina: ||50||
"May you prosper, O Jina, O Lord of Knowledge, O Moon of the Jinas! May your rays of wisdom dispel the darkness of delusion! You are free from attachments, the best friend of the aspiring souls, the founder of the twentieth Tirthankara. ||51||
"O Lord of the Three Worlds, establish the Tirthankara where the beings, scorched by the fire of worldly suffering, may bathe, shed all their impurities of delusion, and attain the supreme, blissful abode of Shiva. ||52||
"The Laukantika gods, enlightened by the complete cessation of karma, the karma of conduct, delusion, and attachment, addressed the Jina in this way.  They did not speak further, for the worthy ones, engaged in fulfilling their duties, never fall into the fault of repetition. ||53||
"At that time, the gods of the four realms, led by Saudharma Indra, filled the sky with their countless celestial chariots.  They reached the Lord, showered him with fragrant water, and adorned him with wondrous ornaments. ||54||
"The sage Suvrata, the Lord of the Munis, crowned his son Suvrata, born of his power, as king.  Suvrata, shining like the moon in the sky of the Harivamsha, adorned himself with a white umbrella, white fly whisks, and a magnificent throne. ||55||
"Then, the king, who had been lifted up by the kings of the earth and then by the gods of heaven, rode in a magnificent, variegated chariot, known for its beauty.  He departed for the forest on the sixth day of the bright fortnight of Kartik, the day of fasting, and the seventh day. ||56||
"I will first fulfill my own supreme purpose, and then, for the benefit of others, I will establish the true Tirthankara." ||48||

With a thousand kings as his retinue, the Lord received the initiation in the presence of all the three worlds. Indra, placing the Lord's hair on his head, cast it into the ocean of milk according to the ritual. ||57||

The gods, having celebrated the auspicious occasion of the Lord's departure and his worship, departed to their respective abodes. The Lord, adorned with the four knowledges and a thousand followers, shone like the sun with a thousand rays. ||58||

On the sixth day of the fast, the Lord, known as Vrishabhadatt, descended to Kushagrapuri to reveal the rules of begging. He offered alms to the Lord, the virtuous Muni Suvrata, according to the ritual. ||59||

The Lord, the knower of the rules, the sun-like Muni Suvrata, established in his own Tirtha, instituted a method of begging for the virtuous monks, which was free, unobstructed, requiring standing while eating, involving the use of a bowl, and in which the donor offered food according to the ritual. ||60||

It was a wonder to behold that the milk offered by Vrishabhadatt, the pure-hearted, to the hand of the Muni, was not exhausted even after thousands of other monks and householders partook of it repeatedly. ||61||

Then, the celestial drums of the gods resounded with the sound of "Well done, well done!" The sound filled the entire sky. Fragrant winds blew, a shower of miraculous flowers fell from the sky, and a great stream of jewels poured down. ||62||

The gods, standing in the sky, for a long time, performed this five-fold wonder, which was extremely rare for others. After worshipping the Lord of charity, the accumulator of merit, they departed to their respective abodes. The Lord also went to a place suitable for wandering. ||63||

After spending thirteen months in disguise, on the fifth day of the bright fortnight of the month of Kartik, the Lord, with the wealth of the state of Kaivalya, purified the day, which was like a fire that consumed the clouds and brought prosperity. ||64||

The Lord, mounted on a Palaki, went to the forest. There, on the seventh day of the bright fortnight of Kartik, he was ready to receive initiation, following the rules of the time. ||56||

In the Harivamsha Purana, it is stated that the Lord simultaneously perceived all objects with a single, pure, and unobscured eye. Just as the sun, when it rises, does not require any order or assistance to illuminate objects, so too, the Lord did not need any such thing. ||65||
All the Ahm-Indras, with their hands joined and heads bowed, advanced seven steps from their respective seats. The remaining Indras and Devas, their hearts filled with joy, approached from all sides. ||66||
The kings of men, the lords of the three worlds, worshipped the Lord, who had manifested as a Champaka tree, with devotion. They honored this extraordinary, inconceivable, and infinite being, who possessed the eight extraordinary qualities. ||67||
When the twelve ganas were seated in their respective assemblies, the Ganadhara Visakha, with humility, inquired about the nature of the twelve-limbed Anuyoga path. In response, the Lord expounded the Dharma and manifested the Tirtha on earth. ||68||
The Indras and other Devas, having performed the fourth Kalyanak puja of the Lord, departed to their respective places after paying their respects. The Lord, showering the nectar of Dharma upon countless beings, wandered through many lands. ||69||
There were twenty-eight Ganadharas who knew all fourteen previous Kalpas of the Lord Munisuvratnath, and thirty thousand monks. This Sangha of the Lord was of seven types, possessing various qualities. ||70||
In that Sangha, there were five hundred Muni-Rajas, twenty-one thousand students, eighteen hundred Avadhi-Jnani, the same number of Kevala-Jnani, twenty-two hundred Vikriya-Riddhi holders, fifteen hundred Vipula-Mati holders of Manah-Paryaya knowledge, twelve hundred renowned Vadi who had overcome hatred, fifty thousand Aryikas, one hundred thousand Shravakas who observed Anuvrata, Gunavrata, and Shikshavrata, and 1. Mekam M. ||71||
The Lord, the destroyer of time, through the fire of meditation, burned the vast amount of fuel in the form of karma, and attained Kevala-Jnana. He sanctified the fifth day of the bright fortnight of the month of Margashirsha. ||64||
Now, it is only right that the Lord should perceive all objects simultaneously with a single, pure, and unobscured eye of Kevala-Jnana, because when the sun, devoid of any covering, rises, it does not require any order or assistance to illuminate objects. ||65||
At that time, all the Ahm-Indras, with their hands joined and heads bowed, advanced seven steps from their respective seats. The remaining Indras and Devas, their hearts filled with joy, approached from all sides. ||66||

The Sixteenth Chapter:

247
There were three hundred thousand Shravakas, all of them possessing the qualities of learning and bearing the mark of the soul. There were also three hundred thousand women with minds purified by Right Faith, and surrounded by these noble ones, the Lord, like the moon, shone brightly. ||73||

The Lord lived for thirty thousand years. Of these, seven thousand five hundred years were spent as a prince, fifteen thousand years in ruling, and the remaining seven thousand five hundred years were spent in the practice of restraint. ||74||

At the end of his life, the Lord, the master of the monks, Munisuvrata, ascended the Sammed Shikhar, adorned with forests that bring joy, and freed himself from the bonds of karma. Accompanied by a thousand monks who had also destroyed their bonds, he attained liberation. ||75||

Thirteen days into the bright fortnight of the month of Magha, the Lord, having ceased all activities, remained in the posture of yoga. In the afternoon, with the auspicious constellation of Pushya, the Lord attained liberation, and the Indra, the king of the gods, performed the Nirvana Kalyanak. ||76||

The Lord Munisuvrata's Dharma Tirtha, a place of pilgrimage, continued uninterruptedly on earth for six hundred thousand years. In his Tirtha, the monks were fully empowered by their knowledge of the scriptures, and the constant arrival of the gods brought joy to the people. ||77||

Gautama Swami says that in the world, whoever, with devotion, contemplates, listens to, reads, and remembers this story of the twenty-fourth Tirthankara, adorned with the five auspicious events, will quickly attain the happiness of liberation. ||78||

Thus, having offered this garland of verses, composed in the Vasantatilaka meter, and adorned with the beautiful flowers of the spring season, the Lord Munisuvrata, the conqueror, the wise, may he, by destroying all obstacles, bestow upon us the knowledge of meditation and enlightenment. ||79||

Thus ends the sixteenth chapter of the Harivansha Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which describes the five auspicious events of Lord Munisuvrata, and is part of the collection of the Arishta-nemi Purana. ||16||

## Chapter Seventeen

The Lord Suvrata, belonging to the lineage of Hari, became the master of the earth. He was a virtuous soul, conquering the six internal enemies (lust, anger, greed, delusion, pride, and jealousy), and a guide on the path of the three goals (righteousness, wealth, and desire). ||1||

He had a son named Daksha, who was extremely skilled and intelligent. He appointed Daksha to his position and, after being initiated by his father, attained liberation through the power of his austerities. ||2||

King Daksha, from his wife Ila, had a son named Aileya and, like the ocean giving birth to Lakshmi, a daughter named Manohari. ||3||

Just as the moon's radiance increases with its phases, so too did Manohari, adorned with the qualities of art, grow more beautiful with Aileya. ||4||

When she reached her youth, her waist became slender, and she was adorned with the weight of her large breasts and wide hips. ||5||

Kamadeva, the god of love, abandoned his pride in his flowery arrows, being captivated by her beauty, which was a weapon that could pierce the hearts of even the most resolute men. ||6||

Having been conquered by her beauty, Kamadeva also pierced the heart of Daksha, let alone other men. ||7||

Daksha, whose mind was captivated by his daughter, then, under the guise of a friendly gesture, summoned his subjects to his palace. He asked them, "O virtuous ones, you are knowledgeable about the world. Please consider carefully and answer me without contradiction: If an elephant, a horse, a woman, or any other object in the world is priceless but not suitable for the people, can the king claim it as his own?" ||8-9||

After much deliberation, some of the people replied, "O Lord, whatever is unsuitable for the people is beneficial for the king." ||11||

Just as the ocean is the repository of countless jewels and rivers, so too is the king the repository of the people's wealth. ||12||

Page #287:
---------------------------
## Chapter Seventeen

That which is in your heart, in all the earth, that which is born in the sun, that jewel, let it be made in your hand. || 13 ||

Thus, hearing the words of his people, Daksha, with a contrary mind, declared that he would act according to their permission and dismissed them. || 14 ||

Then he himself took the hand of his daughter. What is the limit, what is the order, of one who is seized by the demon of desire? || 15 ||

Ila Devi, enraged at her husband, separated her son from him. For as long as the lord remains within the bounds of propriety, so long are his wives and others. || 16 ||

Ila, surrounded by great lords, took her son Aileya and went to a fortified country, where she decided to reside. || 17 ||

She built a city like Trivishtapura, a city that was close together, and because it was growing on the earth, it was known as Ilavardhana. || 18 ||

Aileya was established as king, and he ruled there with his people, a pillar of strength, courage, and wisdom, a special mark of the Hari Dynasty. || 19 ||

Being a king, Aileya, who lived in the Anga country, established a beautiful city known as Tamalipti. || 20 ||

When Aileya, desiring to conquer other countries, came to the banks of the Narmada River, he established a city known as Mahishmati, famous on earth. || 21 ||

Staying there, he ruled for a long time with submissive kings. Then, establishing his son Kunima, he went to perform austerities. || 22 ||

Kunima, desiring to conquer and to cause suffering to his enemies, built a beautiful city called Kundina on the banks of the Varda River in the Vidarbha country. || 23 ||

Kunima, considering life to be fleeting, entrusted his wealth to his son, Pulama, and went to the forest of austerities himself. || 24 ||

Pulama, too, established a city called Pulamapura. Finally, he went to perform austerities, leaving behind his wealth and glory. || 25 ||

## Harivamsha Purana:

**Chapter 25:**

The son named Charam, after handing over the kingdom to his son, left for the forest to perform penance.

**Chapter 26:**

Pauloma and Charam, both rulers of vast and undivided kingdoms, were constantly striving to conquer the Sun and the Moon, who were also rulers of vast and undivided realms.

**Chapter 27:**

Together, they established the city of Indrapura on the banks of the river Reva. Charam, on his own, built two more cities: Jayanti and Vanavasy.

**Chapter 28:**

Pauloma had a son named Maheendatta, a wise statesman, and Charam had a son named Sanjay, also a wise statesman. In the end, both Pauloma and Charam renounced the world and took to penance.

**Chapter 29:**

Maheendatta established the city of Kalpura and had two sons: Aristanemi and Matsya.

**Chapter 30:**

Matsya, a valiant warrior, conquered the cities of Bhadrapura and Hastinapura with his four-fold army and resided in Hastinapura with great joy.

**Chapter 31:**

He had a hundred sons, all as powerful as Indra, starting with Ayodhana as the eldest. Matsya, after crowning Ayodhana as the king, renounced the world and became a recluse.

**Chapter 32:**

Ayodhana had a son named Mula, Mula had a son named Shal, and Shal had a son named Surya. Surya established the city of Shubhra.

**Chapter 33:**

Surya had a son named Amar, who built the city of Vajra. Amar had a son named Devadatta, who was as powerful as Indra.

**Chapter 34-35:**

Devadatta had a son named Harishena, Harishena had a son named Nabhasena, Nabhasena had a son named Shankha, Shankha had a son named Bhadra, and Bhadra had a son named Abhichandra, who was known for his brilliance and for defeating his enemies.

**Chapter 36:**

Abhichandra established the Chedi kingdom on the Vindhya mountain and built the city of Shuktimati on the banks of the Shuktimati river.

**Chapter 37:**

Abhichandra had a son named Vasu, born to his queen Vasumati, who was born in the Ugravansha lineage. Vasu was as compassionate as the moonstone.

**Chapter 38:**

In the same city, there lived a learned Brahmin named Kshirakadamba, who was well-versed in the Vedas. His wife was named Swastimati, and they had a son named Parvata.

**Chapter 39:**

The wise teacher Kshirakadamba taught his three disciples, Vasu, Parvata, and Narada, all the scriptures along with their hidden meanings.

**Chapter 40:**

Once, Kshirakadamba was teaching his three sons the Aranyaka Veda in the forest. While he was teaching, he heard the voice of a sage who was flying in the sky.

## The Seventeenth Chapter

**41.** The Muni said, "Among these four men engaged in the study of the Vedas, two will go to the lower realms due to their sins, and two will attain the higher realms due to their virtues."

**42.** Having said this, the Muni, who possessed the eyes of knowledge, compassionate and knowing the state of the world, went somewhere else to another sage.

**43.** Hearing this, Kshirakadambaka's heart became filled with doubt. When the day declined, he sent his disciples home, but he himself went elsewhere.

**44.** Not seeing her husband with the disciples, Svastimati, filled with doubt, asked, "Oh, disciples! Where has the Upadhyaya gone? Tell me."

**45.** They said, "He sent us away saying he would come soon. Mother, he must be coming behind us, don't worry."

**46.** Hearing their words, Svastimati remained silent all day. But when he did not return home even at night, her grief knew no bounds. Knowing her husband's intentions, she thought, "Surely the Brahmin has taken the vow of renunciation." With this thought, she wept for a long time.

**47.** In the morning, Parvata and Narada went to search for him. They wandered for many days and became weary. Finally, they saw Kshirakadambaka sitting in the forest, reading scriptures, in the presence of his Guru. Seeing his father in that state, Parvata's courage failed him. He returned from afar and told his mother everything.

**48.** Hearing the news of her husband's renunciation from Parvata, Svastimati was deeply saddened. Parvata also shared her grief. Finally, gradually overcoming their sorrow, both of them began to live happily as before.

**49.** Parvata had come from afar, but Narada, being humble, went to his Guru, circumambulated him, bowed down, and after conversing with him, took the Anuvrata vow and then returned home.

**50.** The highly skilled Narada went and comforted the grief-stricken Svastimati, bowed to her, and then departed for his own home.

**51.** After this, Vasu's father, King Abhichandra, also became indifferent to worldly pleasures. He left his vast kingdom to Vasu and entered the forest to practice austerities.

In the Harivamsha Purana, Vasu, adorned with youthful vigor, was a master of ethics, like Indra. He had subdued the entire earth, making it like a woman. ||54|| King Vasu sat on a throne made of crystal, placed in the sky. Therefore, other kings considered him to be residing in the sky. ||55|| King Vasu always walked on crystal and always nurtured truth. Therefore, his fame spread on earth that he walks in the sky due to the glory of Dharma. ||56|| He had one wife from the Ikshvaku dynasty and another from the Kuru dynasty. From them, he had ten sons in order: 1. Brihadvasu, 2. Chitravsu, 3. Vasava, 4. Arka, 5. Mahavasu, 6. Visvavasu, 7. Ravi, 8. Surya, 9. Suvasu, and 10. Brihadhvaja. All these sons were like Vasu, extremely ambitious and victorious. ||57-59|| With these ten sons, who were united in affection like the senses, King Vasu was experiencing immense happiness. ||60||

Once, surrounded by many disciples carrying umbrellas, Narada, considering the son of his Guru as equal to his Guru, came to meet the mountain. ||61|| The mountain greeted Narada, and Narada returned the greeting. Then, after saluting the Guru's wife, Narada sat down, discussing matters with the Guru. ||62|| At that time, the mountain, surrounded by students on all sides, was explaining the meaning of the Vedas. He continued to explain with pride, even in the presence of Narada. ||63|| He was saying, "The word 'aja' in the Vedic verse 'Ajairayastavyam' undoubtedly refers to the meaning of an animal." ||64|| Therefore, those twice-born who desire heaven and are knowledgeable about the meaning of words, sentences, and Puranas, should perform sacrifices with goats. ||65|| Narada, whose darkness of ignorance was destroyed by the light of logic, evidence, and scriptures, objected to the ignorant mountain's interpretation. ||66|| Addressing the mountain, Narada said, "O son of the Guru! Why are you resorting to such a reprehensible interpretation? O my fellow student! This tradition has been adopted by you...

Page #291:

## Chapter Seventeen

253

How can there be a difference in tradition among disciples of a single teacher who are always devoted and never abandon their service to the guru?  ||6||

Do you not remember the meaning of the word "aja" as explained by the guru? The eternal meaning is that old rice which does not have the power to sprout is called "aja". ||69||

Even after being told this, the mountain, whose mind was captured by the demon of stubbornness, disregarded the words of Narada and again made a vow. He said, "Oh Narada! What is the use of saying much? If I am defeated in this matter, I will cut off my tongue." ||70-71||

Then Narada said, "Oh Mountain! Like a bird with broken wings, why are you falling into the flames of sorrow with a false side?"  ||72||

The mountain replied, "Go, what is the use of much talk? Tomorrow, we will have a debate in the assembly of King Vasu." ||73||

Seeing that he was lost, Narada went to his own house, saying, "Mountain, I came to see you, and I have seen you. You are corrupt."  ||74||

After Narada left, the mountain, filled with sorrow, told his mother about the incident. ||74||

Hearing the mountain's words, his mother's heart was filled with sorrow. She said, "Alas, I am dead!"  She kept repeating, "Your words are false!" ||75||

"Oh son! Narada's words are true because they are the embodiment of ultimate truth. Your words are false because you are clinging to a contrary meaning." ||76||

"Your father, whose mind was pure and clear, understanding the context of all scriptures, is saying the same thing as Narada." ||77||

Saying this, she went to the house of King Vasu at dawn. King Vasu received her with great respect and asked her the reason for her arrival. ||78||

She told Vasu the whole story, reminding him of the guru-dakshina that was entrusted to her hand during her studies at the guru's house. She pleaded, "Oh son! Although you know all truth and untruth, you should support the words of the mountain and consider Narada's words as false." ||79-80||

Page #292:
---------------------------
254
In the Harivaṃśapurāṇa, at the time of the assembly, Vasu sat on his throne at the beginning of the day. The Kshatriya warriors served him like the gods serve Indra. ||8|| The two learned Brahmanas, Parvata and Nārada, entered the king's assembly. They were surrounded by questioners, experts in all the scriptures. ||43|| Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras, and those who had renounced the world, all entered the assembly. Ordinary people also came, drawn by their natural inclination to ask questions, even without a special invitation. ||84|| Some of them sang the Sāmaveda, which delighted the ears of the people. Some Brahmanas chanted the Vedas clearly and sweetly. ||85|| Some recited the Yajurveda, beginning with the sound of Om. Others repeated many mantras, following their proper order and sequence. ||86|| Some chanted the different types of sounds, including the udātta, anudātta, and svarita, along with the short, long, and prolonged sounds. ||87|| The assembly was filled with Brahmanas who were experts in the study of the Rigveda, Sāmaveda, and Yajurveda, and who had made the entire circle of directions deaf with their loud chanting. ||88|| Vasu, seated on his throne in the sky, blessed Nārada and Parvata, who sat down in their appropriate places with their assistants. ||89|| There were many tapasvi trees, laden with the weight of bark and matted hair, with sprouts like staffs and large fruits like waterpots. ||90|| Among the learned men who sat in the assembly, some were like bridges that prevented the ocean of the assembly from becoming turbulent, some were like scales that ensured impartiality, some were like excellent goads that controlled the elephants of arguments that wandered off the path, and some were like touchstones that tested the true nature of things. When all the learned men had taken their seats in their appropriate places, some of the elders, who were wise and experienced, addressed King Vasu in this way. ||91-93||
O King! These learned men, Nārada and Parvata, have come to you because of a disagreement about something. 
1. tat-sāmani m. | 2. sāma-yajurveda-m. | 3. rūpāḥ m. |

This consideration of the Vedic meaning is not accessible to anyone other than you. For the tradition of others is now broken on this earth. ||95|| Therefore, in your presence, let these learned men decide. Let there be a just victory and defeat. ||96|| When this debate is settled by reason, in accordance with the Vedas, there will be an unambiguous course of action, beneficial to all beings. ||97||

Thus, urged by the elders, King Vasu presented the opposing argument to the mountain. The mountain, filled with pride due to his companions, accepted the argument. ||98||

He said, "The scripture states that those desiring heaven should perform a sacrifice with goats. And here, goats are clearly defined as four-legged animals. ||99||

The word 'aja' is not only used for animals in the Vedas, but also in the world. It is used for animals from young to old, including females. ||100||

"This man smells like a goat kid," and "This is goat's milk," etc. The meaning of the word 'aja' in these contexts cannot be refuted even by the gods. ||101||

If the established relationship between a word and its meaning is obstructed, then there will be a breakdown of all transactions, and this world will become like blind owls. ||102||

When a word is used without obstruction, it conveys its proper meaning. Both scriptural and worldly usage are clear in this regard. ||103||

Just as in the scripture, "Let one who desires heaven perform the Agnihotra," the well-known meaning of words like 'agni' (fire) is accepted, similarly, in the scripture, "Let those who desire heaven sacrifice with goats," the meaning of 'aja' as an animal is clear. And the meaning of words like 'yaga' (sacrifice) is undoubtedly related to animals. ||104-105||

Therefore, the performance of rituals involving the killing of goat kids should be accepted without doubt. There is no doubt in the statement, "One should sacrifice with goats." ||106||

There should be no fear that the animal suffers during the killing, because the power of the mantras brings about a painless death. The animal does not experience even a little suffering. ||107||

At the end of the initiation, the chanting of mantras provides the animal with a blissful place, directly...

"Where the soul has attained extreme subtlety, what harm can there be? This soul is not susceptible to harm from fire, poison, or weapons, let alone mantras." (109)

The priests, through the sacrifice, send the animal's eyes to the sun, its territory to the directions, its breath to the wind, its blood to water, and its body to the earth. In this way, the priests bring it peace, not suffering. By merely offering the animal in the fire with a mantra, it is directly sent to heaven, where it enjoys immense happiness for a kalpa, just like the priests who performed the sacrifice. (110-111)

It is not correct to say that the animal does not attain heaven because the bond of merit was not made intentionally, as the animal was sacrificed by force. Just as a child's growth is seen even when it is forcibly fed ghee, etc., against its will, so too, the animal sacrificed by force in the yajna attains heaven. (112)

Thus, the mountain, having established its previous point, fell silent. Then, the wise Narada, to refute his argument, spoke as follows: (113)

He said, "O virtuous ones! Listen attentively to my words. I will now shatter the mountain's arguments into a hundred pieces." (114)

"The mountain's statement in the verse 'Ajairyashtavyaam' is false. For, the meaning of 'Aja' is 'animal,' and this is his own imagination." (115)

The arrangement of word meanings in the Veda is not based on one's own opinion, but rather, it depends on the teachings of the learned, just like the study of the Veda. (116)

The meaning of this is that the meaning of words should be determined based on the previous tradition of the gurus. If the meaning of words is determined otherwise, then the study itself will become different. (117)

If it is said that the study is different and the understanding of meaning can be different from it, then this is not correct. Because, how can there be arbitrariness in the matter when the principle is the same in both cases? If the study depends on the tradition of the gurus, then the understanding of meaning will also depend on the tradition of the gurus. This is a principle established by logic. (118)

If it is said that a wise person... (119)

This tradition was not revealed to us for only one guru. We are three worthy disciples: Vasu, Narada, and Parvata. ||12||

There are many words in the world that sound alike. But their usage differs based on the context. ||121||

For example, the word "go" is used for animal, ray, deer, sense organ, direction, speech, horse, and earth, but its usage is distinct in each context. ||122||

In the word "chitraguru," "go" does not refer to a ray, and in the word "ashitagu," "go" does not refer to a cow. ||123||

The usage of words is based on either convention or action. But those who do not retain the teachings of their guru in their hearts forget the meaning explained by the guru. ||124||

Therefore, in the Vedic verse "ajair yashtavya," the meaning of the word "aj" is not derived from its conventional meaning, but from the action-based meaning, "those who are not born are aj." ||125||

Learned people understand the dominance of conventional words in both the world and scriptures. Therefore, the use of the word "aj" in the phrase "ajagandho ayam purusha" is not prohibited. ||126||

Therefore, the previous objection raised by Parvata, that if the inherent meaning of words is not considered, then there will be a loss of practical usage, does not apply to us. Because words are used to achieve practical usage in their respective contexts. ||127||

In the presence of earth and other materials, the three-year-old grain that does not sprout is called "aj." This is the meaning of the word "aj," and such grain should be used for sacrifice. This is the meaning of the verse "ajair yashtavya." ||128||

The meaning of the verb "yaj" is to worship the gods. Therefore, the aforementioned grain should be used by the twice-born to worship the gods. Because the sacrifice performed with offerings and other rituals is the one that yields the fruit of heaven. ||129||

**Notes:**

1. Chitragavo yasya sa chitraguruh = one who has cows with beautiful colors.
2. Ashita ushna gavo kirana yasya so ashitagu = the sun, who has cows that are cold and hot, meaning rays.
3. Kriyashabd samamnaato = meaning derived from the action of the word.
4. Yaj = worship, offering, giving.
5. Nivedyaadi = offerings, rituals.

In the Harivamsha Purana, the ancient Purusha, the Supreme Being, is described as the creator of the six karmas (actions). He is the protector, the Indra-like, the one worshipped by Indra, the self-existent (Svayambhu) praised in the Vedas. He is the guide to the path of liberation, the destroyer of the ocean of worldly existence, the one known as Isha, possessing infinite knowledge and happiness, the great Lord, Brahma, Vishnu, Ishana, the Siddha, the Buddha, free from disease, and the one with the color of the sun, the bull-like. Those who desire their own good worship him. 

From this worship, humans attain heavenly happiness, and from it, they attain the imperishable happiness of liberation. From it, they attain fame, beauty, brilliance, and fortitude. 

One should not even worship a lump of clay imagined as an animal, let alone a real animal, because evil thoughts lead to sin, and good thoughts lead to virtue. 

The animal is said to be of four types, based on name, establishment, wealth, and the difference in feeling. One should not even think of harming such an animal. 

The statement that death caused by a mantra does not bring suffering is false. If there were no suffering, then death would not have occurred in the past, just as it does not occur in a healthy state. 

Death by mantra is impossible without binding the feet and covering the nose. 

It is not true that an animal killed by a mantra attains a comfortable afterlife, because the animal that is killed cries out loudly, like one suffering from a planetary affliction, so its suffering is clearly visible. 

The statement that the soul is too subtle to be killed is also not true, because when the soul resides in a gross body, it is also gross. 

Like a lamp, this embodied being becomes subtle and gross according to the nature of its bodily support, and it undergoes contraction and expansion. 

If the transmigrating being, who experiences countless bodies, is considered to be only subtle and not gross, then how can it experience happiness and suffering? 

Therefore, it is undeniable that the body is the measure, and the mantra, tantra, weapon, and yoga are only for the body, not for the soul.

**259** When a dying being is in great pain, it becomes detached from its senses like eyes, etc. Who else detaches them? (13)

**144** How can there be heaven for one who kills living beings? Because the one who is sacrificed is considered to be going to heaven, therefore, it is an example. (144)

**145** Only righteous actions can bring happiness to the being that is sacrificed. Just as a mother's milk is beneficial for a child, so too, righteous actions are beneficial for the being that is sacrificed. (145)

**146-147** In the assembly, during the rainy season, with his sharp words like a thunderbolt, he broke the false side of the mountain, the mountain of false beliefs. When the cloud, Narada, became silent, the examiners of Dharma in the assembly, and the ordinary people, expressed their gratitude to Narada by shaking their heads and snapping their fingers.

**148** Then, many learned scholars, the wise, asked the king Vasu, who was a celestial being, "O King! Tell us the truth, the words spoken by your Guru."

**150** "O assembly! Although Narada has presented a logical argument...

**142** When the body is harmed by mantras, tantras, weapons, etc., it experiences pain according to the rules.

**143** When the being itself becomes detached from its senses like eyes, etc., due to intense pain, then it is false to say that the priests send their eyes, etc., to the sun, etc.

**144** How can there be heaven for one who kills living beings? Because the one who is sacrificed is considered to be going to heaven, therefore, it is an example.

In the Harivamsha Purana, it is said that Vasu, with only his voice, sank into the earth, his crystal seat remaining behind. Vasu fell into the netherworld, his fall inevitable due to his sins. ||15|| His body, residing in the netherworld, went to the seventh earth. He became a Naraki in the Maharaurva Naraka. ||152|| Vasu, filled with the joy of violence and falsehood, and tainted by fierce meditation, went to the terrible Naraka. Fierce meditation is indeed painful. ||153|| When Vasu fell into the netherworld, all the people were distressed and cried out, "Alas! Alas! Shame! Shame!" ||154|| The people condemned King Vasu, who had immediately received the fruits of his falsehood, and they expelled the wicked mountain from the city. ||155|| They placed Narada, the truth-speaker, the great and the vanquisher of debaters, on a Brahma chariot and honored him, then they all went their separate ways. ||156|| The mountain, having been scorned, wandered through many lands. Finally, he saw the wicked, hated Mahakal, a great Asura. ||157|| The mountain, remembering his previous birth, informed Mahakal, who had been scorned in that birth, of his past life. United with him, the mountain, due to his foolishness, created a treatise on violence, became a deceiver in the world, and showed a violent sacrifice, pleasing the fools who were devoted to the killing of creatures. ||158-159|| Believing in the curse of the teachings of sin, the mountain, under the influence of the curse of sin, died and, as if to serve Vasu, fell into Naraka. ||160|| The ministers placed Vasu's eight sons on the throne, one after the other, in order of seniority. However, they too died within a short time. ||161|| Then, the two remaining sons, Suvasu and Brihadhvaja, were terrified of death. Suvasu fled and stayed in Nagpur, while Brihadhvaja settled in Mathura. ||162||
It is a matter of great sorrow that Vasu, having attained fame born of truth, finally went to Naraka due to his sins, and the mountain, under the influence of pride, also went to the sinful Naraka after him.

## Chapter Seventeen

Having obtained the friend, the Vidyaadhara named Samyagdristi Diwaakara, Narada, having refuted the false doctrines of the mountain, became accomplished and went to heaven. || 163 ||

Compassion for living beings is Dharma, constant renunciation of violence is compassion, and remaining free from killing through mind, speech, and body, even at the cost of one's own life, is the renunciation of violence. The Jinas have declared the renunciation of violence as Dharma. This Dharma, practiced with respect, breaks the fetters of delusion that bind one to heaven and liberation, and leads the wise to boundless happiness. || 164 ||

Thus ends the seventeenth chapter of the Harivamsha Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which is part of the collection of the Arishtanemi Purana, and narrates the dispute between Narada and the mountain in the story of King Vasu. || 17 ||

## The Eighteenth Chapter

Then, Vasu's son, Brihaddhwaja, resided in Mathura. He had a son named Subahu, who was devoted to virtue. [1]

Brihaddhwaja, having entrusted the kingdom's prosperity to Subahu, embraced the prosperity of austerity. Subahu had a son named Dirghabahu, Dirghabahu had a son named Vajrabahu, Vajrabahu had a son named Labdhaabhimaan, Labdhaabhimaan had a son named Bhanu, Bhanu had a son named Yavu, Yavu had a son named Subhanu, and Subhanu had a son named Bhima. [2-3]

Thus, starting with these, hundreds and thousands of kings, following the path of the Muni Suvratnath, ruled the earth. [4]

The lifespan of Naminaath, who succeeded Muni Suvratnath, was fifteen thousand years, and his Tirtha (pilgrimage site) lasted for five lakh years. [5]

In this Tirtha, on the mountain of Harivansha, a king named Yadu, radiant like the sun, arose. He was the progenitor of the Yadavas and spread his influence over the entire earth. [6]

Yadu had a son named Narapati, who became the king of the earth. Yadu, having entrusted the earth to his son, attained heaven through austerity. [7]

Narapati had two sons, Shura and Suvira, both valiant and heroic. Narapati, having established them on the throne, embraced austerity. [8]

Shura, having established Suvira in Mathura, himself became a skilled archer. He built a city named Shauryapur, a city of great valor, in the land of Kush. [9]

From Shura, many valiant warriors were born, including Andhakavrishni. From Suvira, the lord of Mathura, many heroic sons were born, including Bhojakavrishni. [10]

Shura and Suvira, having entrusted the earth to their eldest sons, achieved their purpose and were initiated by the well-established Muni. [11]

Andhakavrishni had a wife named Subhadra, the best of women. She gave birth to ten sons, who were as radiant as the gods and had descended from heaven. [12]

Their names were: 1. Samudravijaya, 2. Akshobhya, 3. Stimit Sagar, 4. Himavan, 5. Vijay, 6. Achal, 7. Dharan, 8. Puran, 9. Yavu, and 10. Bhoopatibhaaskar. [13]

## Chapter Eighteen

263. Abhichandra and ten Vasudevas. All these sons were worthy, deserving of respect, and possessed great fortune, with meaningful names. ||14||

Besides these sons, there were two daughters named Kunti and Madri, who were highly respected, adorned with the qualities of women, resembling Lakshmi and Saraswati, and sisters to the ten brothers, including Samudravijaya. ||15||

The wife of King Bhojakvrisni, Padmavati, gave birth to three sons: Ugrasena, Maha-sena, and Devasena. ||16||

King Vasuka, who had a son named Suvasu, resided in Kunjaravartapur (Nagpur). Suvasu had a son named Brihadratha, who lived in Magadheshpur. ||17||

Brihadratha had a son named Dridharatha. Dridharatha had a son named Naravara. Naravara had a son named Dridharatha. Dridharatha had a son named Sukharatha. Sukharatha had a son named Dipana, who illuminated his lineage. Dipana had a son named Sagarasena. Sagarasena had a son named Sumitra. Sumitra had a son named Vaprathu. Vaprathu had a son named Vindusara. Vindusara had a son named Devagarbha. Devagarbha had a son named Shatadhanu, a valiant warrior who was the best among archers. ||18-20||

After the passage of countless kings in succession, a king named Nihatashatru was born in the same lineage. He had a son named Shatapati, and Shatapati had a son named Brihadratha, who ruled the city of Rajagriha. Brihadratha had a son named Jarasandha, who subdued the entire earth. ||21-22||

He was equal to Ravana in power, the ruler of the three continents, and the ninth among the powerful enemies, comparable in glory to the gods. ||23||

Among many wives, he had a queen named Kalindasena, who possessed all the qualities of a queen. King Jarasandha had many wise sons, including Kalayavana. ||24||

Jarasandha, the emperor, had many brothers, including Aparajita, who resembled fruits on the branches of the great tree of the Hari-vamsa. ||25||

King Jarasandha was the unique and valiant son of his unique mother. He, the lion among kings, ruled over the entire group of Vidya-dhar kings residing in the southern region, while remaining in the city of Rajagriha. The kings of the northern and southern regions, the coastal areas of the eastern and western seas, and all the countries in the middle region were under his control. All beings on earth and in the sky obeyed his commands as if they were a crown on their heads. ||26-28||

## Chapter 264

**29.** The Chakravarti Lakshmi's lord, the illustrious Indra, was adorned with splendor. Once, in the garden of Shouryapur, on the mountain named Gandhamadana, at night, the Muni named Supratistha was seated in a state of Samadhi.

**30.** Due to past enmity, the Yaksha named Sudarshana rained fire, fierce wind, and heavy rain, causing many hardships upon the Muni. But, overcoming all these, the Muni, who destroyed the evil deeds, attained Kevala Jnana.

**31.** To pay homage to him, the group of Indras, including Saudharma, along with the Devas of all four categories, came there and worshipped the Kevali Bhagavan with devotion.

**32.** The king of Shouryapur, Andhakavrishni, also arrived with his sons, wives, and army. He worshipped and paid homage to the Kevali Supratistha with devotion and then sat in his place.

**33.** When all the beings of the world, with folded hands, sat attentively, eager to listen to the Dharmadesha, the Muni Supratistha began to preach.

**34.** He said, "In all three worlds, the attainment of Trivarga (Dharma, Artha, Kama) is said to be through Dharma. Therefore, those who desire it should constantly engage in the accumulation of Dharma."

**35.** "Dharma, performed with a pure mind, speech, and body, leads the being to a place of happiness, be it heaven or liberation."

**36.** "Dharma is the highest form of auspiciousness. Non-violence, restraint, and penance, accompanied by right faith and right knowledge, are the characteristics of Dharma."

**37.** "In this world, Dharma is superior to all things. It is the Kamadhenu among cows, the source of supreme happiness."

**38.** "In this world, Dharma is the ultimate refuge for those seeking refuge, those who are afflicted by birth, old age, death, disease, sorrow, and the scorching sun of suffering."

**39.** "Dharma is considered the cause of all prosperity and happiness for humans and Devas, as well as the cause of liberation and happiness."

**40.** "The Dharma that the twenty-first Tirthankara, Bhagavan Naminatha, preached to his contemporaries in this age, is as follows."

**41-42.** "He said to the Munis, 'The five great vows are: 1. Non-violence, 2. Truthfulness, 3. Non-stealing, 4. Celibacy, 5. Non-attachment.'"

Page #303:
---------------------------
## The Chapter of Eightfold Liberation

**The eightfold liberation is described as:**

1. **Five Great Vows:** Non-violence, Truthfulness, Non-stealing, Celibacy, and Non-possession.
2. **Three Guarded Secrets:** Mind, Speech, and Body.
3. **Five Restraints:** Walking, Speech, Eating, Taking and Giving, and Standing.
4. **Rejection of all harmful actions.** This is the Dharma taught by the wise.

**For householders, the Dharma is described as:**

2. **Three Gunavratas:** Restraint from directions, places, and harmful actions.
3. **Four Shikshavrata:** Samayik, Proshdha, Atithi Puja, and Sallekhana.

**The rules for householders are:**

1. Abstinence from meat, alcohol, honey, gambling, milk, fruits, and vegetables.

4. **The motivation for this is pure vision, compassion, and influence.**

**The Dharma for householders leads to:**

1. **Immediate worldly benefits** like heaven, etc.
2. **Ultimate liberation** through tradition.

**The Dharma for monks leads to:**

1. **Immediate liberation.**

**This Dharma is only attainable in a human body, not in other births.**

**Human birth is difficult to obtain and is full of suffering.**

**Living beings wander through the four realms of existence (hell, animal, human, and celestial) due to their karma.**

**One-sensed beings (with only the sense of touch) wander for a long time in the bodies of earth, water, fire, air, and plants.**

**There are countless beings who are stained by karma and have not yet attained liberation. They remain in the Nigoda state.**

**These beings wander through 84 lakh (8.4 million) types of births and countless families.**

**Note:** The terms "Nigoda" and "Sallekhana" are specific to Jainism and refer to states of existence and a form of voluntary death, respectively.

## Chapter Eighteen

**267** Earth-bodied beings are like lentils in form, water-bodied beings are like drops of water on the tip of a blade of grass, fire-bodied beings are like upright needles, and air-bodied beings are like flags. Plant-bodied beings are of many forms. Hell-beings and those with impaired senses are known to have a form like a lump. **7**

Those with six forms are called Tiryanchas, and the gods are said to have a square form. **72**

The body of a subtle Nigoda being is an immeasurable fraction of an angula (finger width). At the third moment after birth, it is very small. **73**

The body of beings with one sense up to those with five senses, which have subtle and gross distinctions, is also an immeasurable fraction of an angula, if it is very small. **74**

The body of all one-sensed beings is considered to be the size of a lotus, which is a thousand yojanas (leagues) in diameter and one kosha (league) in circumference. **75**

The largest form of two-sensed beings is a conch, which is twelve yojanas in size. The largest form of three-sensed beings is a palm tree, which is three koshas in size. The largest form of four-sensed beings is a bumblebee, which is one yojana and four koshas in size. The largest form of five-sensed beings is a Raghava fish from the ocean of self-existence, which is a thousand yojanas in size. The smallest form of five-sensed beings is a Sikkha fish. **76-77**

The smallest form of Tiryanchas born from Sammoochchhana (spontaneous generation) and who are aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial, is one vitasti (span) in size. **78**

The smallest form of Tiryanchas born from the womb, who are aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial, and those born from Sammoochchhana, who are aquatic and aerial, is one dhanu (bow) in size. **79-80**

Aquatic beings born from the womb and who are perfect are five hundred yojanas in size. The lifespan of humans and Tiryanchas who have three palya (a measure of time) is one crore years. **81, 64-69**

## Harivansh Purana, Chapter 268:

**Verse 2:** The height of the Narakas (hells) is 500 bows, and the height of the Devas (gods) is 25 bows. Their lifespan is the same as before.

**Verse 3:** There are six types of "Paryapti" (sufficiency): food, body, senses, breath, speech, and mind.

**Verse 6:** The sense of touch has many forms, the sense of taste is like a razor, the sense of smell imitates the fragrance of a "Ati Mukta" flower, the sense of sight follows a lentil, and the sense of hearing is like a barley stalk. This is the description of the physical senses.

**Verse 8:** The maximum range of the sense of touch for a one-sense being is 400 bows. For beings with more senses, the range doubles with each additional sense.

**Verse 9:** The range of the sense of touch for a two-sense being is 800 bows, for a three-sense being is 1600 bows, for a four-sense being is 3200 bows, and for a five-sense being is 6400 bows. The range of the sense of taste for a two-sense being is 64 bows, for a three-sense being is 128 bows, for a four-sense being is 256 bows, and for a five-sense being is 500 bows. The range of the sense of smell for a three-sense being is 100 bows, for a four-sense being is 200 bows, and for a five-sense being is 400 bows.

**Verse 10:** A four-sense being can see up to 2954 yojanas with its sense of sight.

**Verse 11:** A five-sense being can see up to 6960 yojanas with its sense of sight. The range of hearing for a five-sense being is 1 yojana.

**Verse 12:** A five-sense being can perceive touch, taste, and smell up to 9 yojanas away. It can perceive sound up to 12 yojanas away.

**Note:** The text mentions "three palya" lifespan for humans and animals, and "three kosha" for their "avagahana" (perception). This information is not translated here as it is not directly related to the main topic of the verses.

In the Harivamsha Purana, it is said that Shri Gautam, having destroyed his parents, was wandering about begging for food. He saw a monk named Samudradatta eating. After his meal, Gautam followed him and reached his hermitage. There, he said to Samudradatta, "I am starving, please make me like yourself." || 103-105 ||

Recognizing him as a worthy soul, the monk initiated him. Gautam, having received initiation, performed severe austerities for a thousand years and extinguished his obstructive sins. || 106 ||

Through the power of his austerities, Gautam became endowed with the seed-intellect and the taste-power. He also attained the inexhaustible great power and the power of following footprints. || 107 ||

His teacher, Samudradatta, performed the worship of the objects of worship perfectly and became the Ahamindra in the spacious Vimāna called Vishala, the sixth Graiveyaka. His disciple, Gautam, performed austerities for fifty thousand years. || 108 ||

Finally, Gautam, the possessor of vast intellect, was born in the same spacious Vimāna, having attained the lifespan of twenty-eight Sagaras. || 109 ||

After enjoying the pleasures of being the Ahamindra, Gautam's soul became Andhakavrishni, and your teacher, Samudradatta's soul, is me, the well-established one. || 110 ||

Thereafter, the sorrowful king Andhakavrishni inquired about the previous births of his ten sons. The Kevali Bhagavan said, || 111 ||

"Once upon a time, in the city of Sadbhadrailpur, there lived a king named Megharatha. His wife's name was Subhadra, and they had a son named Dridharatha. || 112 ||

In the same city, there lived a wealthy merchant named Dhanadatta, who was comparable to the king. His wife's name was Nandayasha. Nandayasha bore him two daughters, Sudarshana and Sujyeshta, and nine sons: Dhanapal, Jinapal, Devapal, Addas, Jindas, Addatta, Jindatta, Priyamitra, and Dharmaruchi. || 113-115 ||

Perhaps, King Megharatha took initiation from the teacher Sumandara. Seeing this, the merchant Dhanadatta also became initiated along with his nine sons. || 116 ||

And Subhadra, the wife of the merchant Dhanadatta, and her two daughters, Sudarshana and Sujyeshta, also took initiation together. || 117 ||

Perhaps, Dhanadatta, the merchant, Sumandara, the teacher, and Megharatha, the king, all three became monks. || 118 ||

## The Eighteenth Chapter

With seven, five and twelve auspicious years, they ascended the Siddha-Shila in Rajagriha city. ||119||

Nanda-Yasha, pregnant at the time, was unable to take initiation. She gave birth to her son, Dhanamitra, and after he grew up, she renounced the world and engaged in austerities. ||120||

Seeing her sons, the nine monks, who had attained the state of Pra-yopagama-sannyasa and were seated on the Siddha-Shila, Nanda-Yasha bowed to them and, overwhelmed with affection, vowed to be their mother in future births. ||121||

The two sisters, Aryikas Sudarshana and Sujyeshta, also vowed to be their brothers in future births, being captivated by the well of affection. Indeed, what is difficult for affection? ||122||

Finally, attaining Samadhi, the mother, sons, and daughters all became deities in the realm of Achyuta. After enjoying supreme bliss for twenty-two oceans of time, they descended to earth and became, O King, your wife, daughters, and sons. This is indeed the case, for there are various paths according to the consequences of actions. ||123-124||

Thereafter, the omniscient Lord Supratishtha, with his mind focused on meditation and ears erect, began to narrate the past lives of Vasudeva in that assembly of humans and gods. ||125||

Just as a nail floating in the waves of the ocean can only reach a hole with great difficulty, so too, this being, immersed in the waves of suffering in the ocean of existence, can only attain the human birth with great difficulty. ||126||

In this way, the being of Vasudeva was born as the son of a very learned Brahmin and his wife in the city of Shaligram in the Magadha country. He did not experience even a little happiness. ||127||

His father died while he was still in the womb, and his mother died at birth. His maternal aunt raised him, but he was only about eight years old when she too passed away, consumed by grief. ||128||

Page #310:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, he resided in the city of Rajagriha, at his maternal uncle's house. He was nurtured by his maternal aunt, thinking, "This is our husband's nephew." ||129|| His body was covered in filth, and he emitted a strong odor like a goat. His hair was scattered and matted, and he wore tattered and dirty clothes. His eyes were naturally yellow. ||130|| Despite this, he desired to marry the daughters of his maternal uncle, Damaraka. However, far from marrying him, those hateful daughters drove him out of their house, causing him great sorrow. ||131|| In the end, he was scorched by the flames of misfortune, becoming as dark as a charred log. Like a moth, he desired to die and went to the Vaibhara mountain, but the sages stopped him. ||132|| After hearing about the fruits of Dharma and Adharma, he greatly condemned himself and, finding peace, took initiation at the feet of the sage named Sankhya. ||133|| Through the sage's proper teachings, he destroyed the fetters of desire and became a holder of Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct. He began to perform austerities that were difficult for others. ||134|| His name was Nandishena. He was endowed with powers born from his austerities, a possessor of the eleven Angas, and a great sage who endured all hardships. ||135|| The fasts that were extremely difficult for others were all easy for this patient sage. ||136|| He performed the Vaiavrittya penance, which is described as having ten divisions, including Acharya, Glana, and Shaikshya. ||137|| This sage possessed great powers, so whatever he thought of for use in his Vaiavrittya penance, such as medicines, would quickly appear in his hand. ||138|| When thousands of years had passed while the sage Nandishena performed austerities, Indra once praised his Vaiavrittya penance in the assembly of the gods. ||139|| At this time, in the Bharat Kshetra of Jambudvipa, the sage Nandishena is the most excellent among those who perform Vaiavrittya penance for the sake of the sages. ||140|| For, whatever remedy a sick sage desires, Nandishena, who possesses forgiveness, quickly fulfills it. ||141||

## Chapter Eighteen

**273**

**142.**  Even a restrained ascetic who is eager to perform *vaiyāvṛtya* through the use of *prāsuka* material does not experience bondage, but only liberation.

**143.**  "The body is indeed the primary means of attaining Dharma for embodied beings. Its protection is the primary duty, as much as possible, according to the teachings."

**144.**  Even if a *samyagdṛṣṭi* is weak, ill, or otherwise afflicted, they should be constantly served by *samyagdṛṣṭi* individuals through *vaiyāvṛtya*.

**145.**  One who is capable of retaliation but neglects a *samyagdṛṣṭi* suffering from illness is a sinner and a destroyer of *samyaktva*.

**146.**  What is the purpose of wealth or a body that is not used for the benefit of fellow practitioners? It is merely a cause of bondage.

**147.**  The wealth or body that is used for the benefit of fellow practitioners is truly one's own.

**148.**  What devotion to the Jina's teachings does a hard-hearted person have who neglects a *samyagdṛṣṭi* in times of need, even though they are capable of helping?

**149.**  What purity of *darśana* does a person have who, despite being a Jain, does not have devotion to *samyaktva* and instead pretends to be humble?

**150.**  If there is an obstacle to the purity of *darśana*, which is the cause of attaining *bodhi*, then attaining *bodhi* again in this world of suffering is considered very difficult.

**151.**  If *bodhi* is not attained, how can *cāritra*, the means of liberation, be achieved? And without *cāritra*, how can a person desiring liberation attain it?

**152.**  Without liberation, how can infinite and imperishable happiness be attained? Without happiness, how can health be achieved? And without health, how can a being perform their duties?

**153.**  Therefore, both ascetics and householders who desire their own welfare should strive to perform *vaiyāvṛtya* in every way, according to their abilities.

**154.**  All virtues, such as the body, *darśana*, *jñāna*, *cāritra*, and supreme *tapa*, are established by the *parātman* through the practice of *vaiyāvṛtya*.

**155.**  A wise person who understands the principles of the teachings, by helping others without expecting anything in return, quickly attains liberation for themselves and others.

He who is deeply engrossed in the Jain teachings while performing *Vyayavritti* cannot be stopped by the gods, let alone by ordinary beings. ||56||
This is how the great sage Nandiṣeṇa is praised by the gods, and they all praised him and bowed to him. ||157||
To test the patience of the sage, a god disguised as a sage approached Nandiṣeṇa and said, ||158||
"O Nandiṣeṇa, you who take great joy in *Vyayavritti*, listen! My body is afflicted with illness, so please give me some medicine." ||159||
Upon hearing this, Nandiṣeṇa, with unwavering compassion, said, "I will give you medicine, O sage, but tell me, what food do you desire?" ||160||
The god in the guise of a sage said, "Rice from the eastern country, fragrant and auspicious, lentil soup from the Pañcāla country, clarified butter from the cows of the western country, sweet milk from the cows of the Kalinga country, and various other dishes. If I could get these, it would be good, for my faith lies in these things." Having said this, Nandiṣeṇa, with great faith, said, "I will bring it now," and went to get the food. ||161-163||
Even though he desired things from different countries, his mind was not troubled. He went to the grazing grounds, brought all the food quickly, and gave it to the fake sage. ||164||
The fake sage consumed the food and drink, but at night, his entire body became soiled with internal impurities. Nandiṣeṇa, without any hesitation, washed him with his own hands. ||165||
Seeing Nandiṣeṇa's unwavering enthusiasm and his dedication to *Vyayavritti*, the god in the divine form said, "O sage, just as Indra praised you in the assembly of gods, I see that you are dedicated to *Vyayavritti* in the world." ||166-167||
"Oh, your power, your patience, your ability to overcome adversity, and your unwavering devotion to the teachings are all amazing. You are a great sage." ||168||
If other wise people also have this same understanding of *Vyayavritti* in the three periods of time while they are practicing austerities, then their devotion to the teachings... ||169||

## The Eighteenth Chapter: The Acquisition of the Kingdom of Samudravijaya

**275** Having praised the Muni, Nandishena attained perfect knowledge and, following the path of the Jinas, ascended to the heavens. **17** After spending thirty-five thousand years in the heavens, the wise Muni, Nandishena, embraced the final six months of his life in renunciation. **171** He renounced his body and food, and did not engage in any actions that would bind his soul. Yet, due to the intensity of his attachment, he bound himself with the desire to be wealthy and fortunate in his next life. **172** If the Muni had not entertained this condemned desire at that time, he would have surely attained the state of a Tirthankara through his own power. **173** After that, he became a great deity, equal to Indra, in the Maha-Shukra heaven, and remained there in happiness for sixteen and a half Sagaras. **174** O King! That same son, after enjoying the pleasures of the heavens, was born as a son named Vasudeva to your queen, Subhadra, on this earth. **175** Hearing this, the Andhaka-Vrishnis, their queen Subhadra, and their son Samudravijaya, along with all the other humans and gods present, attained faith and devotion to the Dharma. **176** After paying their respects to the Kevali, Su-prati-shtha, the gods returned to their respective abodes. Then, the king, Andhaka-Vrishni, who was destined to end his cycle of births, crowned Samudravijaya as king and placed him on the throne. He then entrusted Vasudeva with the task of conquering the oceans and, taking initiation at the feet of the Kevali, Su-prati-shtha, he renounced the world. **177-178** Meanwhile, Bhojaka-Vrishni also renounced the world, taking the vows of a Nirgrantha, and placed Ugrasena on the throne of the entire kingdom of Mathura. **179** King Samudravijaya, having adorned his beloved queen, Shivadevi, with a sacred thread, made her the most prominent among all women. Just as the Jina, the sun, with his eight auspicious qualities, illuminates and delights the beautiful lotuses, the eight auspicious qualities, with his unparalleled splendor, delights his relatives, the lotuses, while protecting the order of the kingdom. **180** Thus ends the eighteenth chapter of the Harivansha Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which narrates the acquisition of the kingdom by Samudravijaya, a collection of the Puranas, and the story of Arishtanemi. **18**

**One should understand the devotion to the Dharma.** **169**

## Chapter Nineteen

277.  Once, those elders, filled with envy, went to King Samudravijaya, bowed down, and in private, said to him, "O King, just as a father listens to his child's words, whether they are wise or foolish, so too, grant us safety and listen to our words, whether they are wise or foolish." 14.

"O Lord, you are a king because you protect the people, you are an emperor because you protect the earth, and you are the king of the world because you delight the people." 16.

"Just as in the time of your father, the people were happy and free from petty troubles, so too, in your reign, the people are happy and free from petty troubles." 17.

"This fertile land, free from the constraints of rain, bears fruit every year with the best of grains, like rice and barley." 18.

"O Lord, just as the fields are prosperous, so too, is commerce. Your kingdom is overflowing with wealth due to the abundance of buying and selling by merchants." 19.

"Like pots, many cows, buffaloes, and excellent breed of cows, satisfied with lush grass, constantly give milk, filling pots and pots." 20.

"Even a small amount of food prepared for the household, due to the giving of charity and the food of the righteous, does not last until the end of the day." 21.

"O Lord, in the sixty-year cycle of time, things naturally change, but due to your influence, the time for us is like the Dundubhi, unchanging. According to the science of astrology, there are sixty years, which change in sequence, bringing with them both loss and gain. But among these years, there is also a year called Dundubhi, in which the people's time passes in happiness. The people are saying to King Samudravijaya that even though the years are changing, for us, due to your influence, the Dundubhi year has become permanent." 22.

"O King, in this way, while there is happiness, there is also a little sorrow, but it cannot be revealed, just like the pain in one's own stomach." 23.

The entire city was filled with excitement, inside and out, and everywhere, the story of Vasudeva was being told. 13.

After that, at some point, those elders, whose hearts were filled with envy, went to King Samudravijaya, bowed down, and in private, said to him, "O King, just as a father listens to his child's words, whether they are wise or foolish, so too, grant us safety and listen to our words, whether they are wise or foolish." 14.

"O Lord, you are a king because you protect the people, you are an emperor because you protect the earth, and you are the king of the world because you delight the people." 16.

The king said, "O wise men, tell me, if you wish my well-being, what is the cause of your sorrow?" 24. Even a small mental affliction, residing in the heart, destroys food, the cause of life, there is no doubt. 25. Thus addressed by him, they, filled with confidence, said, "O king, understand this, our request is not a request, but a plea for the welfare of the people." 26. Vasudeva Kumar, constantly going out of the city, makes the women of the city, bewildered by his beauty, forget their bodies. 27. At his exit and entry, other women become senseless, they neither see nor hear. 28. Let other duties of women remain aside, even the feeding of infants, the giving of milk, is forgotten by them, blinded by passion. 29. O king, Vasudeva Kumar, the most beautiful, the wise, pure in nature, pure in all aspects, the crown of virtue, 30. is known to all on this earth. Yet, what shall we do? The minds of the city dwellers are disturbed. 31. O lord of the city, tell us what is right to do here, so that it may be beneficial to both the city and the Kumar. 32. Hearing their words, the king, after pondering for a long time, said, "So be it," and dismissed them, and they went away. 33. After wandering for a long time, the king, having come to his brother, bowed down. Embracing him, he placed him on his lap and, with affection, smelled his head. 34. "O Kumar, you have been wandering in the forest for a long time, you are very tired. Look, your complexion has faded, and you seem to be suffering from hunger and thirst. Why have you stayed away for so long?" 35. The king, seeing his brother's weariness, his head drooping, his body emaciated, and his love for wandering, said, "O Kumar, you have been wandering for a long time, you are very tired. Look, your complexion has faded, and you seem to be suffering from hunger and thirst. Why have you stayed away for so long?" 36. Just as one cannot show the pain of one's stomach by tearing it open, so too, he could not reveal his slight sorrow. 23. 
Hearing this, the king, Samudravijaya, said to the elders of the city, "If you wish our well-being, tell me your sorrow without fear." 24. Because even a small mental affliction, residing in the heart, is like physical pain, it destroys food, the cause of life, there is no doubt. Meaning: Due to mental distress, a person stops eating and drinking. 25. Thus addressed by Samudravijaya, the people of the city, filled with confidence, began to speak. They said, "O king, our request is not a request, but a plea for the welfare of the people, and you must listen to it." 26. Vasudeva Kumar, going out of the city every day, makes the women of the city, bewildered by his beauty, forget their bodies. 27. At his exit and entry, women become like those without senses, so they neither see nor hear anything else. 28. Let other duties of women remain aside, even the feeding of infants, the giving of milk, is forgotten by them, blinded by passion. 29. O king, Vasudeva Kumar, the most beautiful, the wise, pure in nature, pure in all aspects, the crown of virtue, 30. is known to all on this earth. Yet, what shall we do? The minds of the city dwellers are disturbed. 31. O lord of the city, we have expressed our distress, now tell us what is right to do here, so that it may be beneficial to both the city and the Kumar. 32. King Samudravijaya, hearing the words of the city dwellers, pondered over it for a long time, then assured them and dismissed them, and they went away to their respective places. 33. At that time, his brother Vasudeva, after wandering for a long time, came and bowed down to King Samudravijaya. Samudravijaya embraced him, seated him on his lap, and, with affection, smelled his head, saying, "O Kumar, you have been wandering in the forest for a long time, you are very tired. Look, your complexion has faded, and you seem to be suffering from hunger and thirst. 1. auspicious outcome. 2. very tired. 3. weary head.

"Why have you done this for so long? You have withered from the wind and sun, your head garland has lost its luster, you are so fond of wandering that you do not care about the pain in your body? From today onwards, do not violate the time for bathing and eating, and from today onwards, play only within the garden inside the inner palace." ||34-37||

Thus, the king, filled with devotion to Samudravijaya, explained to his younger brother Vasudeva and, taking his hand, entered the palace of Shivadevi, surrounded by seven enclosures. ||38||

There, he bathed and ate with Vasudeva and personally made arrangements so that Vasudeva would not be aware of anything. Having done all this, King Samudravijaya was happy and carefree. ||39||

And the young Vasudeva also always remained in the gardens of Shivadevi, playing with entertainment like drama, music, etc. ||40||

Then, one day, while a hunchbacked maidservant was carrying a fragrant paste for Shivadevi, the young man harassed her and snatched it away. Enraged, the hunchback said, "Young man! It is because of such actions that you have been imprisoned in this way." ||41-42||

Hearing the hunchback's words, Vasudeva, filled with doubt, asked her, "Hunchback! What have you said? What is the meaning of your words?" Then she told him exactly what the king had advised. ||43||

Then, knowing that he had been deceived, Vasudeva became estranged from the king. Being clever, he left the city under the guise of being righteous. ||44||

He went to the cremation ground at night, taking a servant with him under the pretext of practicing mantras. There, he left the servant at a certain place, instructing him to answer when he called. Then he went alone some distance away. There, he adorned a dead body with his own jewels and placed it on a pyre. Then he said, "May the king, worthy of worship like a father, and the gossiping townspeople live happily for a long time; I am entering the fire." ||45-46||

Saying this loudly, he ran and pretended to enter the fire. Then he disappeared into the distance, leaving the city behind. ||47-48||

When the servant informed the king Samudravijaya of this incident, the king, along with the townspeople, the inner palace, and the Vrishni clan, was immediately... ||49||

Seeing the ornaments of the Kumar in the ashes, the people cried out in the morning. They cried, "The Kumar is dead!" 
The king, overwhelmed with grief and remorse, performed the post-mortem rites. He blamed himself and felt dejected, thinking, "I have been deprived of my brother." 
Fearless, Vasudeva set out towards the west, disguised as a Brahmin, and traveled many yojanas. 
He reached Vijaykheta, a city like the city of the gods. There, he met a Gandharva Acharya named Sugriva, born in a Kshatriya lineage. 
Sugriva, a benefactor of those seeking Gandharva knowledge, was captivated by Vasudeva's appearance. 
He had two daughters, Soma and Vijaysena, whose beauty rivaled that of the moon. They were masters of Gandharva arts. 
Proud of his daughters' accomplishments, Sugriva declared that whoever could defeat them in Gandharva knowledge would be their husband. 
Vasudeva, through his skill and knowledge, defeated the daughters in every subject they excelled in, in the presence of the assembly. 
Pleased, Sugriva gave his daughters to Vasudeva in marriage. Vasudeva, with his daughters, enjoyed himself in the beautiful palaces. 
Vijaysena gave birth to a son named Akrur, who was born in secret, with Vasudeva's strength as his support. 
While traveling, Vasudeva entered a vast forest. There, he saw a beautiful lake adorned with swans, cranes, and lotuses. 
He entered the lake, called Jalavarta, drank the cool water, and bathed for a long time. 
Then, with his tall, strong body, he struck the water, producing a sound like a mridanga. Hearing the sound, a large elephant, sleeping nearby, woke up. 
The elephant, ready to attack, saw Vasudeva, whose face was like the moon.

## Chapter Nineteen

The cunning Vasudeva, swinging on a swing made from the tusks of an elephant, tried to kill the approaching elephant.  ||63|| Having subdued the elephant, adorned with cool water droplets, the masterful Vasudeva climbed upon it, his hand shaking, while the elephant stood still. ||64||  Astonished, Vasudeva, with his head shaking, thought to himself, "This act of mine is like the cry of the forest." ||65||  "If this elephant-play had happened in the city of valor, the world would have been filled with cheers." ||66||  As he was thinking this, two valiant Vidyaadhara princes, with gentle forms, took him from the elephant's head. ||67||  They brought him to the city of Kunjaraavat, situated on the Vijayardha mountain, and left him in the outer garden called Sarva Kaamika. ||68||  There, Vasudeva sat comfortably beneath an Ashoka tree, free from sorrow and distress. The two Vidyaadhara princes bowed and said, ||69||  "O Master! You have been brought here by the command of the Vidyaadhara king, Ashani Vega. Consider him your father-in-law." ||70||  "I am the prince Achimali, and this is Vayu Vega."  Saying this, one of them went towards the city, while the other remained there as a protector. ||71||  "O Master! You are blessed. The valiant, strong, handsome, humble, and youthful elephant-subduer has been brought here."  When he said this to the king, the king, filled with joy, gave him all his ornaments, leaving only his clothes. ||72-73||  Then, the king, with auspicious ceremonies, brought Vasudeva into the city, adorned and watched by the men and women of the city. ||74||  When the auspicious time, star, moment, and karana arose, Vasudeva married the youthful Shyama, the daughter of king Ashani Vega. ||75||  He enjoyed himself with the beautiful woman, skilled in arts and virtues.  At that time, the six-footed creature of the lotus-face, the bee, was attracted to her. ||76||

She played the veena with seventeen strings, pleasing Vasudeva.  He was delighted and said, "Priya, ask for a boon quickly!" ||77|| She bowed and requested this boon: "O Lord, whether it be day or night, may I never be separated from you. This is my boon." ||78|| "My dear, listen to the reason for this boon. I fear that Angarak, the enemy, may snatch you away." ||79|| Here is the explanation:
On the southern slope of Vijayardha mountain, there is a city called Kinnarodgita, praised for its virtues by the Kinnara gods, and considered the crown of Vijayardha mountain. ||80|| In that city, there ruled a king named Archimali, who had complete control over the Vidhyadharas. His wife was Prabhavati, and they had two sons, Jvalanavega and Asanivega. ||81|| King Archimali gave his elder son the kingdom and the knowledge of Prajnapti, and his younger son the position of Yuvaraja. He then initiated them both under the guidance of the guru Arindama. ||82|| O Lord, later, Jvalanavega had a son named Angarak from his queen Vimala, and Asanivega had a daughter named Shyama from his wife Suprabha. ||83|| After that, Jvalanavega gave the kingdom to my father Asanivega and the knowledge of Prajnapti to his son. He then took the Jain initiation, the destroyer of karma, which is auspicious. ||84|| Angarak, a wicked and arrogant Yuvaraja, quickly drove my father out of the country and seized the kingdom. ||85|| O Narakunjara, my father is now disgraced and lives in this city of Kunjaravarta, constantly tormented by worry, like a bird trapped in a cage. ||86|| Once, he saw a Charana Shraman coming from the mountains. Recognizing him as a seer of the three worlds, he bowed down to him. ||87||

My father asked the divine-eyed one, "O Bhagavan! Do you see my kingdom? Will I regain it, O Lord?" || 88 ||
The Muni, opening his pure divine eye, said, "Your daughter Shyama's husband will bring you back your kingdom." || 89 ||
My father asked again, "O Lord! How will I know who her husband will be?" The Muni said, "He who will crush the pride of the intoxicated elephant in the Jalaavarta lake, he will be your daughter Shyama's husband. That is his mark." Following the Muni's order, my father appointed two celestial beings to search for you in the Jalaavarta lake. || 90-91 ||
You were found soon, O Lord! You are the charioteer of my mind, the one who will drive it forward. The words of the Muni are never false. || 92 ||
Angaraka must have known about this, for he is always our enemy and is always ready to destroy us like a smoky fire. || 93 ||
He is arrogant because of his great knowledge, and you are not skilled in knowledge. Although I am capable of protecting you because of my knowledge, if you are ever without me, he might take you away. O Lord! It is because of this fear that I have asked you for this boon, that you never leave me, day or night. || 94 ||
Hearing Shyama's words, Vasudeva said, "Let it be so, what is the harm in that?" Saying this, Vasudeva, smiling softly, embraced his smiling Priya. || 95 ||
Staying there, Vasudeva, free from envy, learned the beautiful Gandharva knowledge related to the celestial beings, with special emphasis. || 96 ||
After that, their time passed with great care. One night, both of them, tired from long lovemaking, were asleep. || 97 ||
Then Angaraka, acting freely, broke their embrace and, just as Garuda carries away a snake, he carried away King Vasudeva from Shyama's bed. || 98 ||
Self-correction: 1. Vartanah ma. 2. Tavaasthaatam ma. 3. Ivaarthe va prayogah.

Harivamsha Purana
Seeing the Vidhyadhar in the sky, Vasudeva said, "O sinner! Who are you? Why are you taking me away? Leave me, leave me!" ||19||
Knowing that it was Angaraka, the enemy, disguised as described by Shyama, Vasudeva did not strike him with his fists, fearing that he might fall from the sky. ||100||
At that moment, Shyama, waking up suddenly, held her sword and shield, and with great speed, stopped him. ||101||
Shyama, rebuking him, said, "Stop, stop! O wicked, cruel, thief Vidhyadhar! How can you take my life-partner while I am alive?" ||102||
"Even though you are sitting on the throne, you are not satisfied. You always think about our sorrow! You have shown yourself to me after a long time. Where are you going? You are going to die now." ||103||
Saying this, Shyama blocked his path, raised her sword, and stood in front of him. Then, the enemy, using harsh words like a Rakshasa, said to Shyama, protecting himself, ||104||
"O lowly Shyama! In the world, killing a woman is considered a sin. Therefore, you should step aside. You are also my sister, so how can my hand rise to kill you?" ||105||
"Or, for those who are desirous of work, what is a woman? What is a sister? What is a brother? They should definitely kill whoever is their enemy. There is no disgrace in this." ||106||
"Are not lionesses and tigresses, who kill men, killed? Therefore, it is useless to consider justice. If you have courage, kill me." ||107||
Then, Angaraka, who was as fierce as a group of coals, attacked Shyama, who had stopped his path with the strength of her knowledge, with blows from his sword, shield, and stones. ||108||
With each blow, there was a sharp clash of sword and shield. After some time, Shyama covered Angaraka's body with sparks from her sword. ||109||
Seeing this magical battle between Shyama and Angaraka, Kumar Vasudeva also struck the enemy's heart with such force with his fists that he felt doubt about his life. ||110||

Angarak, distressed, left the Kumar. The Kumar, fearing a fall, was somewhat dejected, but Shyamalchhaya, a maid appointed by Shyama, caught him in the middle and began to take him to her city. At that time, this celestial voice was heard: "The Kumar will benefit in this very village, so leave him here for now." Following the celestial voice, Shyamalchhaya entrusted the Kumar to her Parnaldhvi Vidya and went home. The Kumar, with the help of that Parnaldhvi Vidya, became light as a leaf and slowly descended towards the earth. ||111-113||

After that, the Kumar Vasudeva fell into a lotus pond, covered with lotuses, in the outer garden of the city of Champa. Emerging from the pond, he reached the shore. ||114||

On the shore of the pond was the temple of Shri Vasupujya Bhagwan, adorned with Manastambha and other things. Vasudeva went near, circumambulated, paid homage, and then settled in that very temple, illuminated by lamps. ||115||

In the morning, a Brahmin came to worship the deity. Vasudeva asked him, "What is this country? And what is this city?" In reply, the Brahmin said, "This is the Anga country, and this is the city of Champa, famous in the three worlds. Don't you know this? Oh, great scholar! Did you fall from the sky here?" ||116-117||

In response, Vasudeva said, "Oh Brahmin! You have understood perfectly. Do you know astrology? Your knowledge is true and consistent. Ah! The Jain teachings cannot be otherwise." ||118||

"Two Yaksha Kumaris, lured by my beauty, took me away. They started quarreling among themselves, and I escaped and fell from the sky to the earth!" ||119||

Giving this answer, Vasudeva, with his large eyes, assumed the guise of a Brahmin and entered that Champapuri, which was like the Gandharvanagari. ||120||

There, seeing people everywhere with veenas in their hands, he asked a Brahmin, "Why are these people wandering around?" ||121||

The Brahmin said, "In this city lives a Seth named Charudatta, who is as wealthy as Kubera. He has a daughter named Gandharvasena. She is proud of her beauty, is very skilled in Gandharva Shastra, and has made this rule: whoever defeats me in Gandharva Shastra and music will be my husband." ||122-123||

Lured by greed, these people, skilled in playing the veena and coming from various countries, have gathered here. ||124||

Harivamsha Purana
This captivating maiden, who navigates the ocean of beauty and auspiciousness, with eyes like a doe, has captivated the entire world. ||125||
Here, every Brahmin, Kshatriya, or Vaishya is a seeker of the maiden, a seeker of fame, a master of the Veena, and a seeker of victory. ||126||
Every month, a gathering of art connoisseurs takes place here, where this maiden, the embodiment of Saraswati, always reigns victorious. ||127||
The gathering of the virtuous had taken place yesterday, and it will convene again after a month. ||128||
Hearing this, Vasudeva asked the Brahmin, "Who is the renowned musician in this city? Tell me." In response, the Brahmin said, "Currently, Sugriva is the most renowned musician." ||129||
Thereafter, Vasudeva, like a member of the household, went to Sugriva, greeted him, and said, "I am of the Gautama lineage, and I wish to become your disciple." ||130||
Considering him to be extremely handsome and innocent, Sugriva, out of compassion, accepted him as his disciple. And he, with his peculiar Veena, would make everyone laugh. ||131||
When the day arrived, the gathering of learned men took place as before. Vasudeva also entered the assembly and observed the vast crowd. ||132||
The assembly was filled with excitement, with those skilled in listening to music and other curious individuals creating a great commotion. ||133||
Then, just as lightning enters the middle of the sky during the rainy season, the maiden, adorned with the purest radiance and the finest ornaments, entered the middle of the assembly. ||134||
Like the embodied Gandharva Vidya, the maiden, guided by Gandharva Sena, defeated many skilled Veena players in succession. Then, Vasudeva also took his seat on a distinguished throne. At that time, many Veenas were presented to Vasudeva, but he declared them all to be flawed. ||132-136||
Finally, Gandharva Sena presented him with his own Veena, named Sughoṣa, which had seventeen strings. Playing it, he joyfully said, "This Veena is excellent, flawless, and expertly crafted! O Gandharva Sena, tell me what you wish to be sung." ||137||
People have gathered here for that maiden. ||124||

May the learned grant me today, with a gentle veena, a topic for singing, O Pandit!  ||139||

She said, "O Vishnu Kumar, who bound Bali, the topic sung by Haha, Tumburu, and Narada, when Trivikrama performed his deed, if you are a master of instruments, let that be the topic you play today. For a topic for singing that is bound to the Puranas is praiseworthy." ||140-141||

Having received the command of Gandharva Sena, Vasudeva began to describe the science of music as follows:

1. **Tata**, 2. **Avanaddha**, 3. **Ghana**, and 4. **Sushira** - these are the four types of instruments. All these instruments are equipped with their own characteristics. ||142||

Those that are played with strings, like the veena, are called **Tata**. Those that are made of skin, like the mridanga, are called **Avanaddha**. Those made of bronze, like cymbals and jingles, are called **Ghana**, and flutes, etc., are called **Sushira**. ||143||

Among these, the **Tata** instrument, being pleasing to the ear, is generally more enjoyable for beings, and because it is connected to the Gandharva body, it is known as **Gandharva**. ||144||

The veena, the flute, and singing are the three causes of the **Gandharva**, and it is considered to be of three types: **Svara-gata**, **Tala-gata**, and **Pada-gata**. ||145||

**Veena** and **Sharira** are the two types of **Svara**, and their differences and characteristics are described as follows: ||146||

**Shruti**, **Vritti**, **Svara**, **Grama**, **Varna**, **Alankara**, **Murcchana**, **Dhatu**, and **Sadharana**, etc., are considered **Veena Svara**, and **Jati**, **Varna**, **Svara**, **Grama**, **Sthana**, **Sadharana Kriya**, and **Alankara Vidhi** are the differences in **Sharira Svara**. ||147-148||

**Jati**, **Taddhita**, **Chanda**, **Sandhi**, **Svara**, **Vibhakti**, **Subanta**, **Tinganta**, **Upasarga**, and **Varna**, etc., are the rules of **Pada-gata Gandharva**, and **Avapa**, **Nishkrama**, **Vikshepa**, **Praveshana**, **Shamyatal**, **Paravarta**, **Sannipata**, and **Savastuka** are the rules of **Tala-gata Gandharva**. ||149||

"Very good, very good, O clever one! This veena is flawless. O Gandharva Sena! Tell me, what topic for singing do you like? You are a connoisseur of topics for singing, so give me your command, and I will play this gentle, radiant veena before these learned ones." ||137-139||

In response, Gandharva Sena said, "When Vishnu Kumar, who bound Bali, showed his three steps, Haha, Tumburu, and Narada sang a topic for singing. If you are a master of instruments, play that same topic today, for a topic for singing that is connected to the Puranas is praiseworthy." ||140-141||

Harivamsha Purana
The yati, prakarana, two types of geet, marg, avayava, padbhaga and pani are all determined by the matra, avidaya, ang, lay and गति. These are the 22 types of talagat gandharva. Thus, Vasudeva used all the aspects of the gandharva (tat) instrument, i.e. he played the veena accordingly. || 142 - 152 || There are seven types of swaras, namely 1. Shadja, 2. Rishabha, 3. Gandhara, 4. Madhyama, 5. Panchama, 6. Dhaivata and 7. Nishad. There are four types of using these swaras, namely vadi, samvadi, vivadi and anuvadi. Vasudeva used all these four types in order. || 153-154 || In the Madhyama grama, there is a samvad between the Panchama and Rishabha swaras, and in the Shadja grama, there is a samvad between the Shadja and Panchama swaras. || 155 || In the Shadja grama, the Shadja swara has four, Rishabha has three, Gandhara has two, Madhyama has four, Panchama has four, Dhaivata has two and Nishad has three shrutis. || 156 - 157 || In the Madhyama grama, the Madhyama swara has four, Gandhara has two, Rishabha has three, Shadja has four, Nishad has two, Dhaivata has three and Panchama has three shrutis. || 158 - 159 || Thus, there are twenty-two shrutis in each of the Shadja and Madhyama gramas, and fourteen moochchhanas are said to be formed by combining these two gramas. || 160 || Among these, the first is Uttarabhadra, the second is Rajani, the third is Uttarayata, the fourth is Shuddha Shadja, the fifth is Matsarikrita, 1.

The sixth is Ashvakranta and the seventh is Abhirudgata. These seven are known as the Shadja grama Murchhanas. || 162 ||

Sauviri, Harinashva, Kalopanta, Shuddha Madhyama, Margavi, Paurivi, and Rishaka (Hrishaka) are the seven Murchhanas of the Madhyama grama, to be known by the wise. || 163-164 ||

Uttaramandra in Shadja, Abhirudgata in Rishabha, Ashvakranta in Gandhara, Matsarikrita in Madhyama, Shuddha Shadja in Panchama, Uttarayata in Dhaivata, and Rajani in Nishad are the seven Murchhanas of the Shadja grama. || 165-166 ||

Sauviri in Madhyama, Harinashva in Gandhara, Kalopanta in Rishabha, Shuddha Madhyama in Shadja, Margavi in Nishad, Paurivi in Dhaivata, and Rishaka (Hrishaka) in Panchama are the seven Murchhanas of the Madhyama grama. || 167-168 ||

These fourteen Murchhanas have four variations each: Shadava, Audava, Sadharana-krta, and Kakali. Thus, there are fifty-six variations. || 169 ||

The Murchhanas of both gramas are combined with Antar-svara. When they are combined appropriately, one Murchhana becomes two. This is explained in detail. || 170 ||

There are eighty-four types of Tana, of which thirty-five are produced from five notes and forty-nine from six notes. || 171 ||

The combination of *antar-svara* should always be in the ascending mode, and never in the descending mode, even if it is slight. **(12)** If it is done in the descending mode, whether slightly or greatly, the *antar-svara* destroys the *jati*, *raga*, and *shruti*. **(17)**

In the Harivamsha Purana, it is said that there are twelve vehas (types of musical notes) and five swaras (musical notes) that are always present. These swaras are always to be considered as the basis of the notes. 

**195**

The destruction of all swaras is permissible in the jaatis (musical scales), but the destruction of the madhyama (middle note) is never permissible.

**196**

The madhyama is considered the best of all swaras, as it is never destroyed. It is also accepted in all the divisions of the Gandharva Kalpa (musical system).

**197**

The characteristics of the jaatis are: tara (high note), mandra (low note), nyasa (placement), etc. (upannyasa, graha, amsha), alpatva (smallness), bahutva (largeness), shadav (six notes), and audava (five notes).

**198**

These ten characteristics of the jaatis are to be known by the wise. The use of each jaati in a particular rasa (emotion) is explained.

**199**

The raga (melody) resides in a particular jaati and originates from it. The mandra or taramandra that is found in abundance, the graha, upannyasa, vinyasa, sannyasa, and nyasa that are found in abundance, and the anuvritti (repetition) are all considered as the ten types of amshas (parts).

**200-201**

The sanchara (movement), amsha, balasthan (strong position), alpatva (smallness) of the weak notes, and the various types of antarmarg (internal paths) are the characteristics that reveal the jaatis.

**202**

There is no amsha in the mandra, but there are two nyasas. The arshabha amsha is seen in the gandhara graha and nyasa.

**203**

Just as the amsha is accepted in all the jaatis, so is the graha. The amsha that is present when a particular graha is used is considered to be the amsha of that graha.

**204**

The jaatis that have two grahas have a total of 36 amshas. These amshas are grouped into six.

**205**

The madhyama, udichya, and nandayanti have the panchama amsha and the panchama graha.

**206**

The dhaivati has the dhaivata and rishabha amshas and grahas. The panchami has the panchama and rishabha amshas and grahas.

**207**

The gandhara, udichya, and nandayanti have the panchama amsha and the madhyama graha. The arshabha has the dhaivata and rishabha amshas and grahas.

**208**

It is necessary to know the amshas and the grouping of the jaatis into six swaras.

## Chapter Twenty-One:

**The Nishad, Shadava, Gandhara, and Arshabha**

**Verse 209:**  The Gandhara, Arshabha, Nishad, and Shadava are the six middle notes of the Shadja Kaishiki.

**Verse 210:** The Grahas and Nyasas of all three Jatis have been described. The Gandhara, Arshabha, Nishad, and Panchama are the four initial Grahas.

**Verse 211:** The Shadja, Arshabha, Madhyama, and Panchama are the final Grahas.

**Verse 212:** In the Madhyama Jati, the Gandhara and Dhaivata are the Grahas. The Nishad, Shadja, Gandhara, Madhyama, and Panchama are the Grahas of the Rakta Gandhara.

**Verse 213:** The Grahas of the Kaishiki are the Arshabha, Yoga, and all the notes.

**Verse 214:** All the notes are known as Grahas, and the Shadja and Madhyama are the Grahas. Thus, there are sixty-three Grahas and as many Amshas in each Jati.

**Verse 215:** The Grahas are to be known as Amshas in all the Jatis. The three Jatis have three types of Gunas.

**Verse 216:** There are six Gunas, which are the increasing notes: Ekasvara, Dvisvara, Trisvara, Chatursvara, Panchasvara, Shashsvara, and Saptaka.

**Verse 217:** The Graha and Amsha calculations have been explained earlier.

**Verse 218:** In the Shadja, there are five notes excluding the Nishad and Arshabha. The Gandhara and Panchama are the Upanyasas.

**Verse 219:** The sixth note is the Nyasa, and the Arshabha and seventh note are omitted. The Gandhara should be emphasized by the performer.

**Verse 220:** In the Arshabha, the Nishad and Dhaivata are the Amshas and Upanyasas, and the Arshabha is the Nyasa.

**Verse 221:** In the Dhaivata, the Dhaivata and Arshabha are the Nyasas, and the Dhaivata, Arshabha, and Panchama are the Upanyasas.

**Verse 222:** In this Jati, five notes are used, excluding the Shadja and Panchama. The Shadava is defined as the remaining notes excluding the Panchama.

**Verse 223:** The Pancha-svara and Shadava are both Arohaniya (ascending) and Langhaniya (passing). Similarly, the Nishad, Arshabha, and Gandhara are strong.

**Verse 208-209:** The Shadja and Madhyama are the two Amshas and Grahas in the Dodi Jati. The Dhaivata, Arshabha, and Nishad are the three Amshas and Grahas in the Arshabha Jati. The Shadava, Gandhara, and Arshabha are the three Amshas and Grahas in the Nishadini Jati. Similarly, the Shadja, Gandhara, and Madhyama are the three Amshas and Grahas in the Shadja Kaishiki.

**Verse 210-211:** The Grahas and Nyasas of all three Jatis have been described. The Gandhara, Arshabha, Nishad, and Panchama are the four initial Grahas. The Shadja, Arshabha, Madhyama, and Panchama are the final Grahas.

**Verse 212-214:** In the Madhyama Jati, the Gandhara and Dhaivata are the Grahas. The Nishad, Shadja, Gandhara, Madhyama, and Panchama are the Grahas of the Rakta Gandhara. The Grahas of the Kaishiki are the Arshabha, Yoga, and all the notes. All the notes are known as Grahas, and the Shadja and Madhyama are the Grahas. Thus, there are sixty-three Grahas and as many Amshas in each Jati.

**Verse 215:** The Grahas are to be known as Amshas in all the Jatis. The three Jatis have three types of Gunas.

**Verse 216-217:** There are six Gunas, which are the increasing notes: Ekasvara, Dvisvara, Trisvara, Chatursvara, Panchasvara, Shashsvara, and Saptaka. The Graha and Amsha calculations have been explained earlier.

1.  In the Harivamsha Purana, Nishad, Nishadansha, Gandhar and Rishaba are the Upanayasas, but the seventh note is the Nyasa.
2.  In the Dhaivati jati, Shadava and Audavita should be used. Both are to be bypassed and ascended like before.
3.  The Shadja Kaishiki's Gandhar and Panchama are the Grahamshas, and the Shadja, Panchama and Madhyama are the Upanayasas.
4.  Here, Gandhar, whether it is a lower or higher note, is the Nyasa. Also, the Dhaivata and Rishaba notes should be used weakly.
5.  Shadja, Madhyama, Nishad and Dhaivata are the Shadja Udicyava's Anshas, Madhyama is the Nyasa, and Dhaivata and Shadja are the Upanayasas. Here, according to the Chanda, there is also a mutual exchange of Anshas.
6.  Where there are five notes excluding Panchama and Rishaba, Shadja, Rishaba and Gandhar are strong.
7.  Shadja and Madhyama are the Upanayasas of all, and Shadja and Saptama are the Nyasas of all.
8.  Panchasvayam is combined with Gandhar and Saptama notes, and Shadava should be combined with Saptama note.
9.  The movement of all these notes is done as desired. These seven Jatis are based on the Shadja Grama.
10.  In the Gandhari jati, there are only five Anshas excluding Dhaivata and Rishaba. Shadja and Panchama are the Upanayasas.
11.  Here, Gandhar, born from Shadava and Rishaba, is the Nyasa, and Audavita, devoid of Dhaivata and Rishaba, is the Nyasa.
12.  Here, Rishaba and Dhaivata are always bypassed, and when bypassed, it is from Rishaba to Dhaivata. Thus, the movement of the Gandhari jati's notes, Nyasas and Anshas is described.
13.  The characteristics of Rakta Gandhari are similar to Gandhari. The special feature is that Dhaivata and Panchama notes are strong in it.
14.  Here, the movement of Gandhar and Shadja occurs without Dhaivata and Panchama, and Madhyama is the Upanayasas with Madhyama.
15.  In Gandhar Udicyava, Shadja, Madhyama and Saptama are the ...

The work is the independent path, the placement and the removal, and the rules for the Gandhara and the Odicya are all mentioned there. || 240 ||

In the Madhyama, there are six parts, excluding the Gandhara and the Saptama. There is only one removal and one placement, which is the Madhyama. || 241 ||

The Pancha-svayam is performed, excluding the Gandhara and the Saptama. Sometimes, the Shat-svayam is also performed, excluding the Gandhara. || 242 ||

Here, the work is to give prominence to the Shadja and the Madhyama, and the users should always avoid the Gandhara. || 243 ||

In the Madhyama-Odicya, there is only one Madhyama part, and the rest of the rules should be followed as in the Madhyama. || 244 ||

There are two parts in the Panchama, the Rishabha and the Panchama. There is one removal, which is the Panchama, and one placement, which is also the Panchama. || 245 ||

The rules of the Madhyama should be known here, as well as the Shadava and the Odavita. The Shadja, Gandhara, and Panchama should be made weak here. || 246 ||

The movement of the Panchama and the Rishabha should be done here. The movement of the Gandhara with the Panchama can also be done. || 247 ||

One Panchama part of the Gandhara-Panchama is mentioned, and the Panchama and the Rishabha are mentioned as its removals. || 248 ||

The Gandhara is the placement here, and it takes its previous note. The movement between the Panchama and the Gandhari is also done. || 249 ||

The Rishabha, Panchama, Gandhara, and Nishad are the four parts of the Andhri, and these are also the four removals. || 250 ||

The Gandhara is the placement, and the Shadava, which is without the Shadja, is the Shat-svayam. The movement between the Gandhara and the Rishabha takes place here. || 251 ||

Sometimes, the movement of the Shashta and the Saptama also takes place according to the movement of the placement. There is no avoidance of the Shadja here, and the Odavita is also present. || 252 ||

In the Harivamsha Purana,
"Even though they are not *Nanda*, the *ansha* (parts) are also *Nanda* in the same way. *Gandhara*, *Madhyama*, and *Panchama* are always present. || 253 ||
The *Shadja* *ansha* is not to be *langhiya* (transgressed), nor is it to be *Andhri* (like the *Andhri* jati). *Langhana* (transgression) of the *Rishaba* *ansha* is mentioned here, and it is considered to be in *mandra* (low) speed. || 254 ||
In the *Tara* (high) *graha* (position), the *Nysa* (placement) should also be done in the same way. In the *Karmaaravi* jati, *Rishaba*, *Panchama*, *Dhaivata*, and *Nishada* are the four *ansha* mentioned, and these four are also mentioned as *Apanya* (non-placement). In this, the *Panchama* is the *Nysa*, and it is *Hinasvarya* (low in pitch). || 255-256 ||
*Gandhara* is specifically mentioned as moving everywhere. In the *Kaishiki* jati, with the *Shadja*, all the *ansha* and *Apanya* are considered except for the *Rishaba*. There are two *Nysa* in *Gandhara* and *Saptama*, but in the *Dhaivata* and *Nishada* *ansha*, there is only one *Nysa*, which is *Panchama*. || 257-258 ||
Sometimes, the *Rishaba* is also considered as *Nysa*. In this, the *Shadava* is without the *Rishaba*, and the *Dhaivata* is used without the *Rishaba*. Here, *Audavita* (a specific type of movement) should not be done, the last and *Panchama* *svara* should be made strong, and the *Rishaba* should be made weak, and its *Langhana* (transgression) should be done specifically. || 259-260 ||
In this, the *Shadja* and *Madhyama* are moved. In this way, the *jati* that move the *svara* should be used according to their *rasa* by the wise. || 261 ||
And so on, as appropriate, in the detailed explanation of the *Gandharva* Shastra. When Vasudeva sang beautifully in this way, the listeners were filled with wonder. || 262 ||
People started saying, "Is this Tumburu? Or Narada? Or a Gandharva? Or a Kinnara? Because who else can play the Veena like this?" || 263 ||
When Narada and others praised Vishnu Kumar Muni in the same way as they did when he was tied to the stake, Vasudeva played the Veena and sang the same song. Hearing this, the Gandharva army was amazed and speechless. || 264 ||
In this way, when Vasudeva took the victory flag in the assembly, a loud sound of "Sadhu-Sadhu" (well done) echoed from all sides. || 265 ||
Filled with natural affection,
1. *Mandra* *yanty* *ma*
2. *Dhaivata* *sani* *shada* *cha* *ma* *ga*

## Chapter Nineteen: The Tale of Gandharva Sena

297
This one, like a Gandharva, surrounded by Gandharva maidens, Gandharva Sena, filled the world with joy. ||26|| 
Charudatta, pleased, then, as per the prescribed ritual, said, "O King of Magadha, let the marriage of these two take place." ||26||
Sugriva and Yashogriva, the preceptors, also gave their daughters to Vasudeva, attaining complete satisfaction. ||269||
He, with those women, skilled in arts and virtues, played for a long time, like a king with his queens. ||27||

Having obtained a garland, a greedy thief, somehow, stole it through a hole, taking it far up in the sky. 
He then released it, letting it fall down, leaving it helpless in the lotus forest. 
O noble ones, strive to attain that one, the Dharma-friend, on the path spoken of by the Jinas, who quickly makes men prosperous with excellent benefits. ||271||

Thus ends the nineteenth chapter of the Harivamsa, composed by Jinasena Acharya, containing the story of Gandharva Sena, from the collection of the Arishta-nemi Purana. ||19||

Gandharva Sena, surrounded by Gandharva maidens, married Vasudeva, placing a garland around his neck. ||266||
At that time, surrounded by Gandharva maidens, like a Gandharva, Gandharva Sena, filled the entire world with joy. ||267||
Then, Gautama Swami said, "O Shrenika! Charudatta, the father of the maiden, pleased, performed the marriage of the two according to the prescribed rituals." ||268||
The preceptors, Sugriva and Yashogriva, also gave their daughters to Vasudeva, attaining satisfaction. ||269||
Vasudeva, with those beautiful women, skilled in various arts and virtues, played there for a long time. ||270||

A greedy Vidhyadhara, finding a hole, stole the garland and took it far up in the sky.

## The Twentieth Canto

Then, the illustrious Shrenik asked the Ganadhara, "O Lord, why was Vishnu Kumar Muni imprisoned by Bali?" ||1||

The chief of the Ganadharas replied, "Listen, Shrenik! I will tell you the story of Vishnu Kumar Muni, a story that purifies vision and is pleasing to hear." ||2||

Once upon a time, in Ujjayini, there lived a renowned king named Shridharma. His queen was named Shrimati, who was truly beautiful and possessed great virtues. ||3||

King Shridharma had four ministers: Bali, Brihaspati, Namuchi, and Prahlad. All of them were knowledgeable in the path of mantras. ||4||

One day, the great Muni Akampan, accompanied by seven hundred monks, arrived at the outskirts of Ujjayini, having crossed the ocean of scriptures. ||5||

The people of the city, eager to pay their respects, rushed out like the waves of the sea. Seeing this, the king, standing on his palace, asked his ministers, "Where are these people going on this untimely journey?" Bali replied, "O King! These people are going to pay their respects to the ignorant Digambara monks." ||6-7||

After that, King Shridharma also expressed his desire to go there. Although his ministers tried to stop him, he insisted and went. Finally, the ministers, compelled by the situation, accompanied the king and, upon seeing the monks, engaged in some debate. ||8-9||

At that time, all the monks of the Sangha were silent, following their Guru's instructions. Therefore, the four ministers were forced to return. On their way back, they saw a monk and started arguing with the king. The said monk, Shruta Sagar, defeated them, as they were all deluded by the wrong path. ||10||

That night, the said monk was seated in a state of meditation. The four ministers went to kill him, but the gods protected him. Seeing this, the king banished them from his kingdom. ||11||

At that time, in Hastinapur, there lived a Chakravarti named Mahapadma. He had eight daughters. ||12||

_1. Ujjayiniyam bhavedraja ma. | 2. Shridharmo ma. | 3. Niryaatamiv ma. | 4. Anunudan ma. |

## Chapter Twenty

Eight celestial beings brought back the girls who had been taken away.  These girls, having donned pure white garments, renounced the world and took vows of non-attachment.  The eight celestial beings, also renouncing the world, began to practice austerities.  ||12-13||

This event caused the great emperor Mahapadma to renounce the world.  He gave his kingdom to his elder son, Padma, born to Queen Lakshmi-mati, and took initiation with his younger son, Vishnu Kumar. ||14||

Just as the ocean is the reservoir of rivers, so too, Vishnu Kumar, the ascetic who wore the three jewels and practiced austerities, became the reservoir of many spiritual powers. ||15||

Vali and other ministers, who knew the state of the country and the times, served King Padma, who had ascended the new throne. ||16||

Following the advice of his minister Vali, King Padma captured the lion-force stationed in the fort.  He then said to Vali, "Ask for a boon and receive your desired object." ||17||

Vali, being very clever, bowed and placed the boon in the hands of King Padma, saying, "I do not need it now, I will ask for it when the need arises."  Thus, he kept his boon in reserve.  After this, Vali and the other four ministers enjoyed their time in contentment. ||18||

Then, after some time, Akampana-charya, along with many other monks, slowly arrived in Hastinapur.  They stayed outside the city, observing the four-month rainy season retreat. ||19||

After this, Vali and the other ministers were struck with fear and anxiety.  They were filled with pride and began to think of ways to get rid of the monks. ||20||

Vali went to King Padma and said, "O King!  You granted me a boon.  Therefore, give me the kingdom for seven days." ||21||

King Padma, remaining invisible, said, "Take it, the kingdom is yours for seven days."  Vali, having ascended the throne, began to harass Akampana-charya and the other monks. ||22||

He surrounded the monks and caused smoke from leaves, leftover food, and broken pots to be thrown at them. ||23||

Akampana-charya and the other monks, enduring these hardships, stood firm, observing a vow of silence and refusing to eat or drink. ||24||

At that time, Vishnu Kumar's omniscient guru was in Mithila. ||25||

300
In the Harivamsha Purana, a terrible affliction, unprecedented before, is befalling the seven hundred yogis, beginning with Acharya Akampana. ||26||
The small Pushpadanta, in great confusion, asked, "Where, O Lord, is this affliction?" The Guru clearly said, "In Hastinapur." ||27||
The small one again asked, "O Lord, from whom can this affliction be averted?" The Guru said, "From Vishnu Kumar Muni, who has attained the power of Vikriya Riddhi and who is capable of even intimidating Indra." ||28||
That small Pushpadanta went to Vishnu Kumar Muni and informed him. The Muni tested whether he had attained the power of Vikriya Riddhi. ||29||
He stretched out his arm towards the wall of the mountain in front of him. His arm pierced through the wall of the mountain and continued forward without any obstruction, as if it were moving through water. ||30||
Having ascertained the attainment of the Riddhi, Vishnu Kumar Muni, who was a devotee of the Jina religion and dear to the humble, went to King Padma, who was bowing down, and said, "O Padma Raja! What have you started doing after becoming the king? Such an act has never been done by the Raghuvamshi on earth." ||31-32||
If a wicked person afflicts the ascetics, the king should remove him. Why is this affliction emanating from the king himself? ||33||
O King! Even a great fire, however blazing, is extinguished by water. If the fire itself starts from water, then how can it be extinguished by any other substance? ||34||
Certainly, power is accompanied by the fruit of command, that is, the fruit of power is command, and command is the suppression of the wicked. If the king-god is devoid of this action, unable to suppress the wicked, then such a god is also called a stationary object, that is, he is a god in name only. ||35||
Therefore, quickly remove this wicked force, which is like an animal, from this evil act. What is this hatred towards the ascetics who have equal feelings towards friends and enemies? ||36||
To cause suffering to a virtuous person who has a cool disposition is not for peace, because just as water that has been heated too much becomes distorted and burns, so also... ||37||

## The Twentieth Chapter

**301** The valiant, with their hidden strength, are firmly established in their bodies. Even the virtuous, at times, can be as scorching as fire. **38** Therefore, O King! Until a great calamity befalls you, do not disregard this evil act of Vali. Do not neglect yourself or those who depend on you. **39** 
Then, bowing his head, Padma said, "O Lord! I have given Vali the kingdom for seven days, I have no authority over it now. **40** You, O Lord, go and rule over him. By your unyielding wisdom, Vali will surely accept your words." 
Upon hearing this, Vishnu Kumar Muni went to Vali. **41** And said, "O good man! Why are you engaged in this condemned act of promoting unrighteousness for half a day? **42** What harm have those sages, who are absorbed in the single-minded pursuit of penance, done to you, that you, being superior, have acted like an inferior towards them? **43** Due to their fear of the bondage of their own actions, the ascetics never harm others through their mind, speech, or body. **44** Therefore, this evil act of yours towards those peaceful sages is not right. If you desire peace, quickly retract this transgression born of negligence. **45** 
Then Vali said, "If they leave my kingdom, the transgression may be removed, otherwise, it will remain as it is." **46** 
Vishnu Kumar replied, "These are established in their own yoga, they will not move even a step from here. They may abandon their bodies, but they will not violate the established order. **47** Grant me three steps of land for the stay of those sages. Do not make yourself too harsh. I have never begged anyone before, yet for the sake of these sages, I beg you for three steps of land. Therefore, grant my request." **48** 
Accepting Vishnu Kumar's request, Vali said, "If they transgress even a step beyond that boundary, they will be punishable. I have no fault in this." **49** For a man in the world is afflicted with calamity when he breaks his word, not when he is the protector of his word. **50** 
The virtuous, filled with sorrow, become distorted and only give water - they destroy with curses, etc. **37** 
Those who are valiant, whose strength is hidden, and who have firmly controlled their bodies, even such virtuous ones can sometimes be as scorching as fire. **38**

In the Harivansha Purana, that deceitful, disobedient, and dishonest one, like a wicked serpent, was wicked in nature and was subdued. ||51|| "O sinner! See, I am measuring three steps of the earth," saying this, he made his body so large that it touched the celestial sphere. ||52|| He placed one step on Meru, the second on the Manushottara, and the third, not finding space, wandered in the sky. ||53|| At that time, due to Vishnu's influence, the three worlds were disturbed. The Kimpurusha and other gods began to say, "What is this? What is this?" ||54|| The Gandharvas, with their wives, sang sweet songs near that Muni, who played the Veena, flute, etc. ||55|| His feet, with red soles, were wandering freely in the sky, and his nails, like mirrors, were reflecting the faces of the Kinnara and other celestial women who had gathered for music. ||56|| "O Vishnu! O Lord! Remove the disturbance of the mind, remove it. Due to the influence of your penance, the three worlds have become agitated today." Thus, the gods, the Vidyadharas, the Gandharvas playing the Veena, the Siddhanta-singing Charanas, and the Muni who wandered in the high sky, pacified him with sweet songs. Then, gradually, he contracted his agitation and became calm, like the sun after the eclipse is over, returning to his original form. ||57-59|| At that time, the gods quickly removed the affliction of the Munis, bound the wicked Valika, punished him, and banished him from the country. ||60|| At that time, the Kinnara gods brought three Veenas. The Veena named Ghosha was given to the Vidyadharas who lived in the Uttarashreni, Mahaghosha to the residents of Siddhakoota, and Sughosha to the Vidyadharas of the southern bank. ||61|| Thus, by removing the affliction and showing affection for the Jain religion, Vishnu Kumar Muni went straight to his Guru and, through atonement, removed the affliction. ||62||
1. Like the eclipse that has arisen, M.

303. Having performed severe austerities and destroyed all his karmas, the Kevali Vishnu, the Lord, went to liberation, having enjoyed himself. ||63||

This is the story of Vishnu Kumar, the destroyer of sins. Whoever hears it with devotion attains purity of vision. ||64||

A virtuous person can, at will, move even the heaviest Mandara mountains from their places, can cause the sun and moon to fall from the sky by the power of his hands, can scatter the turbulent oceans, and can even liberate those who are not worthy of liberation. What is difficult for the yogis who are the bearers of the light of the austerities of the Jina religion? Nothing! ||65||

Thus ends the twentieth chapter of the Harivansha Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which is a collection of the Arishta-nemi Purana, and which describes the greatness of Vishnu Kumar. ||20||

The Twenty-First Chapter

Then, seeing Gandharvasena, who was born in the lineage of the Kshecharas, and Charudatta, who had rejected the wealth of kings, Yadu, the best of the best, who enjoyed the pleasures of the best assemblies, and who was himself a man of noble character and loved those of noble character, asked him, "How did you acquire these riches, which are incomparable and which indicate both your fortune and your prowess? Tell me, why does this praiseworthy Vidyaadhari, who is full of wealth, reside in your house and shower nectar on my ears?" ||1-4||

Asked thus by Vasudeva, Charudatta, with a joyful mind and with respect, said, "O wise one, you have asked well. Listen, I will tell you my story." ||5||

In the city of Champa, there lived a very wealthy merchant named Bhanudatta. His wife's name was Subhadra. ||6||

Both of them, who had purified their vision and were observing various Anuvratas, were enjoying their time immersed in the ocean of happiness and adorned with the fullness of youth. ||7||

After some time, when the lotus face of a fortunate son, who was the fruit of their household life and who was showering nectar on their minds and eyes, was delayed, they were both worshipping in the temple. At that time, they saw a Charana, a sage with great powers, and asked him about the birth of a son. ||8-9||

The sage, out of compassion for the couple, said, "You will soon have a noble son." ||10||

And soon after, I was born, a son who brought joy to them. I was named Charudatta, and a great celebration was held for my birth. ||11||

I was initiated into the Anuvratas and learned all the arts. Like a young moon, I increased the wealth of my family, which was like an ocean. ||12||

## The Twenty-First Canto

**305**

Varaha, Gomukha, Harisingha, Tamontak, and Marubhuti, these five were my friends, dear to me. ||13||

With them, playing, I went to the Ratnamali river. There, on the bank, I saw a spot where no footprints were found, indicating a couple's presence. ||14||

Suspecting a Vidyaadhara couple, we went further. There, in a green Kadali grove, we saw their bed of love. ||15||

The flowers and leaves of the bed were wilted due to their amorous activities. A little further, we saw a dense forest. ||16||

There, on a tree, we saw a Vidyaadhara, pierced with iron nails. His red eyes were fixed on the shield and sword lying nearby. ||17||

Seeing this, I took three divine herbs hidden under the shield: Chalan, Utkeelan, and Unmool-Vran-Roh. With Chalan, I made him move; with Utkeelan, I removed the nails; and with Unmool-Vran-Roh, I healed the wounds caused by the nails. ||18||

As soon as he was free from nails and wounds, he silently took his shield and sword, flew into the sky, and ran towards the north. ||19||

Following the sound of weeping, he ran towards it and rescued his beloved, who had been abducted by an enemy. Bringing her back, he came to me and said with great respect, "O noble one! Just as you gave your life for me, a dying man, so too, give me your command. Tell me, what can I do for you?" ||20-21||

In the southern range of the Vijayaadham mountain, there is a city called Shiva Mandir. There, a righteous king named Mahendra Vikram rules. I am his beloved son, Amitagati. My friends are two Vidyaadharas named Dhoomasingha and Gaurmund. ||22-23||

Once, with those two friends, I went to the Hrimanta mountain. There, a sage named Hiranyaroma lived. He had a beautiful daughter named Sukumarika, who was in the prime of her youth and as delicate as a Shirisha flower. ||24-25||

Page #344:
---------------------------
306
In the Harivamsha Purana, my father, who was deeply troubled by the affliction, requested her for me. And thus, the marriage of the two was celebrated with great festivity. ||26||  Dhoom Singh, too, was seen to be desirous of that delicate maiden. Therefore, I always enjoyed her company without any negligence. ||27||  But today, while I was enjoying her company, he bound me and took her away. You freed me and I rescued her from the enemy. ||28||  Therefore, engage this person (me) in the desired task today. Because you are my life-giver, even though I am older in age, I will serve you. ||29||  Although you have removed my affliction and kept me alive, in truth, my affliction will be removed only when I repay your kindness. ||30||
Thus, I said to that Vidyaadhara, who spoke sweet words with his wife, that all my work is done since you are showing such auspicious feelings towards me. Tell me, showing your pure intention, what have you not done for me?  The act of showing auspicious feelings to people is their benefit. ||31-32||  O sinless one! Certainly, I have become virtuous and worthy of worship today, because your darshan, which is rare for ordinary humans in the world, has become easy for me. ||33||  The change in the state of humans is a common thing, therefore, do not be disheartened by my being bound by the enemy. ||34||  O father! If you have the intention of doing me a favor, then consider me your son forever.  Upon my saying this, he said, "Very well." Then, he asked my name and lineage and flew away with his wife. ||35-36||  And we entered the city of Champa, talking about that Vidyaadhara.  Indeed, it is true that new things, which are seen, heard, and experienced, are pleasing to humans. ||37||
When I was young, I married a girl named Mitravathi, who was born from the womb of my maternal uncle, Sarvartha's Sumitra. ||38||  Because I was very fond of scriptures, I was also wise in matters of my wife.  The fondness for scriptures is an obstacle to other vices. ||39||

In the Harivamsha Purana, 
Kalingsena had previously signaled to the courtesan. Therefore, she welcomed and honored both of us with offerings of seats and other courtesies. || 54 || 
Then, Kalingsena and Rudradutta began to gamble. Kalingsena won Rudradutta's upper garment in the gamble. Then, I was eager to play with Kalingsena, removing Rudradutta from the game. || 55 || 
Seeing me eager, Vasantasena could not bear it. Therefore, she, being clever, separated her mother and began to gamble with me. || 56 || 
I was engrossed in gambling for a long time. Meanwhile, I became very thirsty. She gave me cool water, fragrant with a mind-enchanting yoga. || 57 || 
Due to excessive trust, my love for her grew. Her mother made me hold her hand. || 58 || 
I lived there for twelve years, forgetting my parents and my beloved wife, Mitravati. What to speak of other matters? || 59 || 
The virtues that had grown in me through the service of elders were covered by the vices that arose from the service of a young woman, just as virtuous people are covered by wicked people. || 60 || 
Our father was a wealthy man with sixteen crore dinars. When all the wealth gradually went to Kalingsena's house, and finally Mitravati's ornaments began to arrive, seeing this, Kalingsena, skilled in mantras, spoke to Vasantasena one day in private, saying, "Daughter! I speak for your benefit, so listen to my words." || 61-62 || 
The person who always practices the mantra, the nectar of the words of the guru, is always far away from the planet of misfortune, it never comes near him. || 63 || 
You know our despicable profession, that a wealthy man is our beloved. A man whose wealth has been extracted is like the husk of sugarcane, fit to be discarded. || 64 || 
Today, Charudatta's wife sent her body ornament. Seeing it, I returned it out of compassion. || 65 || 
Therefore, now abandon this worthless (poor) Charudatta and enjoy another wealthy man, like a new sugarcane. || 66 || 
1. Rudradutta's upper garment is called Rudradutta. 
2. Our profession is despicable, a wealthy man is our beloved. 
3. Send it back.

## The Twenty-First Canto

**309**  As if a nail had been hammered into her ear, Vasantasena, deeply distressed, spoke to her mother, "Mother, what have you said?  "

**68**  Having abandoned Charudatta, whom I accepted in my youth and lived with for a long time, what use do I have for Kubera? What to speak of other wealthy men?

**69**  What more can I say?  Even my life is of no use to me without Charudatta. Mother, if my life is dear to you, do not speak such words again.

**70**  Your house is filled with millions of dinars brought from his home, yet you still desire to abandon him.  It is indeed true, for women are ungrateful.

**71**  Mother, how can I abandon Charudatta, who is a master of the arts, exceedingly beautiful, a knower of the right Dharma, and supremely generous?

**72**  Knowing that Vasantasena was deeply attached to me, Kalingasena said nothing at that time, agreeing with her, but in her mind, she was thinking of a way to separate us both.

**73**  We both sat together, slept together, bathed together, and ate together, so she did not get an opportunity to separate us. One day, using some Yoga (Tantra), she put us both to sleep and took me out of the house at night.

**74**  When I woke up, I went home. My father had taken Muni-diksha, so my mother and wife were very distressed. They were weeping and wailing, and seeing them, I was also very sad.

**75**  Then, comforting my mother and wife, and taking my wife's ornaments in my hand, I went to the Usiravarta country with my maternal uncle for business.

**76**  There, I bought cotton and was going to Tamralipta Nagar to sell it, but due to the adverse nature of fate and time, the cotton was burnt to ashes in a fire.

**77**  I left my maternal uncle there and rode a horse towards the east, but the horse died on the way. So, I walked on foot and reached Priyanganagar, tired and exhausted.

**78**  At that time, a merchant named Surendradutta, a friend of my father, lived in Priyanganagar. He saw me and welcomed me with great joy. I stayed there for a few days and rested.

In the Harivamsha Purana, while traveling by sea, I lost everything in a shipwreck.  I was left with nothing but the clothes on my back.  I was fortunate to find a piece of driftwood and, with great difficulty, I managed to swim to shore.  After reaching the shore, I arrived at the city of Rajapura, where I saw a wandering ascetic.  

I was exhausted, so the ascetic, who was dressed in simple robes, offered me rest.  He then lured me into a dense forest, promising me delicious fruit.  

I was naive and trusting, so the ascetic lowered me into a deep pit using a rope and a bucket.  He told me that the pit was filled with delicious fruit, and I, driven by my hunger, eagerly descended.  

Once I reached the bottom of the pit, I secured myself to the rope and began to fill the bucket with fruit.  Suddenly, a man appeared and stopped me.  

He said, "Don't touch this fruit, my friend! If you want to live, stay away from it.  If you touch it, it will kill you, just like a fatal disease."

I was shocked and immediately asked, "Who are you, and why are you here?"

He replied, "I am a merchant from Ujjayini.  My ship was wrecked, and a wicked ascetic threw me into this pit, which is filled with a monstrous, poisonous fruit."

"I have been eating this fruit, and only my skin and bones remain.  There is no escape for me, my friend.  I can only leave this place when I die."

He then asked me, "Who are you?"

I replied, "I am a merchant named Charudatta.  The same wicked ascetic who threw you into this pit also threw me in."

"He is a deceiver, a wolf in sheep's clothing.  He is a master of deception, and he lures people to their doom.  It is no surprise that you have fallen into this trap."

The ascetic then pulled up the rope with the bucket of fruit, leaving me stranded at the bottom of the pit.  He cut the rope that was attached to the bucket, leaving me with no way to escape.  He then left, satisfied with his evil deed.

When I reached the shore, a kind man saw my plight and helped me escape.

---------------------------
The twenty-first chapter:

A goh (female buffalo) will come here to drink the juice. If you quickly grab its tail, you will surely escape. ||12||

Hearing this, I, being at the end of my life, explained the Dharma to that man with Samyak Darshan and told him the five prostrations. ||13||

The next day, when the goh was leaving after drinking the juice, I grabbed its tail with both hands and it pulled me out. ||14||

My body was torn apart by the friction of the banks, so when the goh left me, I fainted. When I regained consciousness, I thought that I had been reborn. ||15||

Getting up slowly, I walked ahead, and a terrifying buffalo like Yama chased me. Seeing an opportunity, I entered a cave in the middle of the forest. ||16||

A sleeping python was in that cave. When I stepped on it, it woke up and caught the terrifying buffalo in its mouth while running towards it. ||17||

Both the buffalo and the python were very fierce, so while they were fighting, I climbed onto the python's back and quickly escaped. ||18||

Leaving the great forest, I reached a nearby village. By chance, I saw my uncle Rudradatt there. ||19||

I was hungry and thirsty for many days, so Rudradatt relieved my hunger and thirst and said to me, "Charudatt! Don't be sad, listen to my words. ||20||

We will both go to the Suvarna Dweep (Golden Island) and earn a lot of wealth, and then we will return to Champapuri to protect our family lineage." ||21||

After agreeing with Rudradatt, we both left from there, crossed the Airavati river, crossed the Girikuta mountain and the Vetravana forest, and reached the Tankana country. The path there was very difficult, so we bought two clever goats, rode them, and slowly moved forward. ||22-23||

After crossing the level ground, Rudradatt said to me with great respect, "Charudatt! There is no path ahead, so let's kill these goats, make their hides into a boat, and sit in it. The Bharunda birds with sharp beaks will throw us into the boat because of their greed for meat." ||24||

Page #350:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana,
Even though forbidden, the fierce Rudradutta killed his own goat. He, who had fallen from virtue, also ended my goat. || 106 ||
As soon as my goat was being killed, I had already countered it. When it was being killed, I gave him the Panchanamaskara mantra. || 107 ||
Having made a pit, he placed me inside it, and entered another pit himself, with a weapon in his hand. || 108 ||
Then, the Bharunda birds, with their sharp beaks, carried both the pits into the sky. My pit was taken by a one-eared Bharunda bird, and he dropped it on the earth in another place. || 109 ||
I quickly tore open the pit and came out. I saw a vast island, shining with rays of jewels, like heaven. || 110 ||
While looking at the beautiful directions of that island, I saw a Jinalaya on the peak of a mountain, which seemed to be dancing with flags fluttering in the wind. || 111 ||
Near that Jinalaya, I saw a Charana, a Shramana, who was engaged in the Tapasya of the Aatapan Yoga. Seeing him, I attained a supreme happiness that I had never experienced before. || 112 ||
Then, climbing the mountain, I circumambulated the Jinalaya three times and worshipped the artificial images of the Jina Chandras. || 113 ||
I also worshipped that Muni, who was engaged in Yoga, with devotion. When his Niyama ended, he sat down and blessed me. || 114 ||
"Charudatta, are you well? How did you come here, like a dream? You are like a common man, and there is no one to help you." || 115 ||
"O Nath! I am well, by your grace," saying this, I bowed to him. Then, with a surprised mind, I asked that great Muni, "O Nath! How did you recognize me? I consider this holy vision of yours to be extraordinary." || 116-117 ||
Asked thus, he said, "I am the same Amitagati, the Vidyadhara, who was defeated by the enemy in Champapuri. You had..." || 118 ||

## The Twenty-First Chapter

Having established me in the kingdom, my father, filled with the feeling of Right Faith, initiated me into the order in the presence of the venerable Hiranyakumbha. ||119||

My wives were Vijayaseena and Manorma. The first, Vijayaseena, had a daughter named Gandharvaseena. ||120||

The second, Manorma, had two sons, the elder named Singhayasha and the younger named Varahagriva. Both were repositories of virtues like humility. ||121||

Having established them in the kingdom and the position of heir apparent respectively, I, following the order, took initiation from my father, who was my guru. ||122||

"O Charudatta! This is the island of Kumbhakantaka, surrounded by the ocean, and this is the mountain Karkotaka. How did you come here?" ||123||

Hearing this from the Muni, I narrated my entire story, from beginning to end, filled with both joy and sorrow, in whatever way I could. ||124||

At that time, two excellent Vidyadhara sons of the Muni descended from the sky and bowed to the venerable Muni. ||125||

Addressing his sons, the Muni said, "O Kumaras! This is your brother Charudatta, whom I mentioned earlier." Hearing this, the two Vidyadharas embraced me and sat down near me, speaking words of affection. ||126||

At that time, two Devas descended from the front of their celestial chariots and bowed to me first, and then to the Muni, and sat down in front of me. ||127||

The Vidyadharas then asked the reason for this irregularity, "O Devas! Why did you bow to the Shravaka first, leaving the Muni?" ||128||

The Devas replied, "This Charudatta has taught us the Jina Dharma, therefore, consider him our true Guru." ||129||

"How is that?" Hearing this, the Deva who was formerly a goat said, "O Vidyadharas! Listen, I will tell you my story clearly." ||130||

Once upon a time, in Varanasi, there lived a Brahmin named Somasharma, who was well-versed in the meaning of the Puranas, the Vedas, and the secrets of grammar. His wife was named Somila. ||131||

They had two daughters, named Bhadra and Sulasa, both in their youth, who were experts in the scriptures like the Vedas and grammar. ||132||

Page #352:
---------------------------
Harivan'sha Purana

The two daughters, out of their renunciation, took to the life of a wandering ascetic. They gained great fame on the earth by defeating many debaters in discussions. (133)

The wandering ascetic named Yajnavalkya came to the city of Varanasi, with the desire to defeat them. (134)

During the debate, Sulasa, out of her arrogance, declared in the assembly that she would become the servant of whoever defeats her in the debate. (135)

Yajnavalkya refuted the arguments presented by Sulasa in front of the scholars versed in logic. He then established his own viewpoint. (136)

Sulasa, being defeated in the debate, chose Yajnavalkya as her husband. Yajnavalkya, being attached to sensual pleasures, indulged in improper conduct with her. (137)

Sulasa and Yajnavalkya had a virtuous child. But being cruel, they left the newborn child under a peepal tree and departed. (138)

Bhadra, the elder sister of Sulasa, found the child lying under the peepal tree, eating its fruits. She named him Pippalaada and took care of him. (139)

Once, Pippalaada, who had mastered all the scriptures, asked Bhadra, "Mother, what is the name of my father? Is he alive or not?" (140)

Bhadra replied, "Child, your father is Yajnavalkya. He had defeated my younger sister Sulasa in the debate, and she became his wife." (141)

"When you were just born, and had no protector, they, being devoid of compassion, left you under the tree and are still alive." (142)

"I have nourished you with the breasts of another woman, enduring great suffering. Child, you must have done some such karma earlier, that your parents are so lustful." (143)

Hearing these words of Bhadra, which were like burning his ears, Pippalaada became filled with anger. Determined to defeat his father Yajnavalkya in the debate and serve his parents with false humility. (144-145)

Pippalaada, driven by anger towards his parents, brought them before the court of Dharma. (146)

Twenty-first Chapter: I was a disciple of Pippalad, named Vagvali, and I was dull-witted due to the scriptures. I supported his views and thus was born in hell, experiencing terrible torment. ||147|| Then, I was born as a kid goat six times, and each time, those who knew the science of yajna, burnt me in the yajna performed on the mountain. ||148|| Even in the seventh time, I was born as a goat in the Tankanak country, driven by my own sins, born from killing living beings. ||149|| Then, the compassionate Charudatta showed me the pure Jain Dharma and gave me the five prostrations mantra at the time of death. ||150|| By the influence of the Jain Dharma, I became a great god in the Saudharma heaven. Thus, Charudatta is my true guru, and therefore, I bowed to him first. ||151|| Having said this, when that god became silent, another god said, "Listen, Charudatta, I tell you how he is my Dharma-deshak." ||152||
I was a merchant before. A parivrajaka threw me into the Rasa-kūpa. Later, that same parivrajaka threw Charudatta into the same Rasa-kūpa. I was on the verge of death, so here, with compassion, he gave me the appropriate Dharma-upadesha. ||153|| Accepting that appropriate Dharma, taught by Charudatta, I died and became a great god in the Saudharma heaven. Thus, Charudatta is my true guru, and therefore, I bowed to him first. ||154|| Who is equal to that person in the world, who gives the support of Dharma-hand to those who are drowned in the well of sin, and who is the savior of the world? ||155|| Even a person who forgets the giver of a single letter, half a verse, or a verse, is a sinner, then what to say about a person who forgets the giver of Dharma-upadesha? ||156|| Those who are wise know that the repayment of a person who has been previously benefited is only by reciprocation, not otherwise. ||157||
If a person is unable to reciprocate due to lack of power, how can he be considered noble if he does not show his good intentions towards his benefactor, without any pride? The meaning is that the first point is that one should reciprocate the favor of the person who has done a favor to him. If, by chance, he is unable to reciprocate, then... 1. Nirate M. 2. -Tarana M. 3. Padarthasya M.

In the Harivamsha Purana, after saying this, the two gods, in the presence of the Muni and the Kshecharas, displayed their great wealth with divine chariots and celestial beings. They honored me with clothes purified in fire, ornaments, garlands, and unguents. They adorned me with the finest jewels and said, "O Master! Please give your command for whatever needs to be done. Should we send you to Champapuri today, with great wealth and riches?" 

I replied, "Go to your respective places now. When I remember you, you may return." 

They said, "As you command," and with folded hands, they bowed to me and the Muni. Then, after taking leave of us, they departed for their own heaven. 

I also bowed to the Muni and, accompanied by the Kshecharas, boarded a celestial chariot and entered the city of Shiva's temple. 

The city of Shiva's temple seemed like heaven itself. I resided there happily, served by many Kshecharas. It felt as if I had been born anew. Everywhere I went, people spoke of my fame. 

One day, the two Kumaras came to me with their mother and, showing me the Gandharva-sena, a young woman, they began to discuss matters with me. 

They said, "O Charudatta! Listen. Once, King Amitagati, adorned with Lakshmi, asked the Muni, who possessed divine knowledge, 'In your divine vision, who appears to be the husband of our daughter Gandharva-sena?'"

The Muni replied, "A Yadu-vanshi king, a scholar of Gandharva Vidya, will come to the house of Charudatta. He will conquer this girl in Gandharva Vidya and become her husband."

Hearing the Muni's words, the king had decided on this matter at that time. Although King Amitagati has now taken initiation and become a Muni, he had decided at that time to place the full responsibility on you. Therefore, you are the authority for us."

In response, I accepted this task, which had come to me by fortune. Then, with the family, including the nurse, this girl was entrusted to me. 

The girl's two brothers, adorned with various jewels and gold, were ready to go to Champapuri with a retinue of Kshecharas.

The Twenty-First Chapter

The two friend-devas, who were engaged in the work of a friend, were remembered by me.  As soon as they were remembered, they arrived at my place with treasures in their hands. || 372 ||  They brought me to Champanagari in a beautiful swan-chariot, along with the Gandharva-sena, with wealth that caused wonder. || 173 ||  Having arranged everything well in Champanagari with inexhaustible treasures, the devas bowed and went to heaven, and the two celestial beings went to their own abode. || 174 ||  Having seen my maternal uncle, mother, wife, and other relatives with great respect, I was filled with joy and attained happiness. || 175 ||  Having heard that Vasantasena, the courtesan, had come from her mother's house and was serving her mother-in-law and was adorned with Anuvratas, I was very pleased and accepted her as my own. || 176 ||  I gave a Kimichchak dana to satisfy the poor and the destitute, and I gave whatever they desired to all my relatives. || 177 ||  Thus, O Yadava! I have told you about the relationship I have with the celestial maiden and the wealth I have acquired. || 178 ||  O Yadunandan! You have obtained this fortunate maiden, for whom she was kept, so I must say that you have made me fulfilled. || 179 ||  The ascetics have told me that my liberation is near, and after this birth, you will attain heaven by performing austerities, so now I will strive for austerities with a peaceful mind. || 180 ||  Thus, Vasudeva, having heard the relationship of Gandharva-sena from beginning to end and the enthusiasm of Charudatta, was very pleased and praised Charudatta, saying, "Oh! Your effort is accompanied by great generosity, Oh! Your extraordinary merit is also praiseworthy.  It is difficult to have such valor without the power of destiny, and what to speak of ordinary humans, even devas and celestial beings cannot attain such wealth." || 181-183 ||  Having heard the account of Charudatta and his own efforts, Vasudeva told him his entire story, from the beginning to the end of his obtaining Gandharva-sena and others. || 184 ||

In the Harivamsha Purana, those who are oceans of form and knowledge, knowing each other's true nature, and delighted by the experience of the three goals of life, like Charudatta, reside happily. ||185||

The Shārdūlavikrīḍita verse says: Even if a man, though impoverished, falls into the ocean, or descends into a well, or wanders on the inaccessible shores of a mountain, or even reaches another island, he attains all prosperity by the destruction of his sins. Therefore, O wise ones, gather the jewel of Dharma, the *chintamani*, taught by the Jinas. ||186||

Thus ends the twenty-first chapter, named "The Story of Charudatta," in the Harivamsha Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which is a collection of the Arishtanemi Purana. ||21||

## Twenty-Second Canto:

The festival of the eighth day of the Phalguna month arrived while Vasudeva was enjoying himself in Champa with the Gandharva Sena. ||1||

Devotees of the Lord, filled with joy, went to the island of Nandishvara, the Sumeru mountain, and other places. ||2||

Devas and Vidyadharas arrived in Champa, a city adorned with radiant houses, where Vasupujya was born, attained enlightenment, and achieved Nirvana. ||3||

From all directions, earth-dwellers and celestial beings, along with their wives and children, came to celebrate the festival of the Jina. ||4||

All the people of Champa, including the king, went out to worship the image of Vasupujya. ||5||

Some went in chariots, some on elephants, and others on horses and camels. The women of the city, adorned with beautiful ornaments, went out on the pilgrimage. ||6||

Kumar Vasudeva, mounted on a chariot drawn by horses, along with the Gandharva Sena, went out of the city to worship the Jina, carrying all the necessary offerings. ||7||

While passing through the midst of the army, Kumar Vasudeva saw a girl dancing in the guise of a Matanga-kanya in front of the Jina temple. ||8||

She was dark like the petals of a blue lotus, with round, full breasts, and adorned with ornaments that sparkled like lightning. She resembled the goddess of the rainy season, with her lush greenery, towering clouds, and flashing lightning. ||9||

Or, her lips were red like the petals of a Bandhuka flower, her hands and feet were like the finest lotuses, and her eyes were like white lotuses. She appeared like the goddess of the autumn season, embodied in form. ||10||

Or, she was a beautiful girl who, while dancing with devotion to the Jina, resembled the goddesses of wealth, patience, wisdom, Lakshmi, and Saraswati. ||11||

Singers, along with their entourage, were present in the arena of the dance. There were players of the mridanga, panava, dardura, cymbals, vipanci, and vina. ||12||

Page #358:
---------------------------
## Harivamsha Purana

The *kutapa* (dancer) was described as being of three types: excellent, mediocre, and inferior, each possessing different qualities.  Those who excelled in their art were like the *alatacakra* (a wheel without spokes), performing flawlessly in singing, playing instruments, and dancing.  ||13-14||

The dancer, skilled in expressing *rasa* (emotions), *abhinaya* (acting), and *bhava* (feelings), was seen by the prince Vasudeva, seated in his chariot with Gandharvasena. ||15||

Upon seeing each other, the dancer and the prince were instantly bound by their respective *rupa* (form) and *vijnana* (knowledge) like a snare.  At that moment, they became both the binder and the bound, entangled in the snare of mutual attraction. ||16||

Witnessing this, Gandharvasena's eyes narrowed in jealousy, for the presence of a rival always causes such a reaction. ||17||

"Staying here longer will be harmful and frightening," she thought.  Addressing the charioteer, she said, "O charioteer, quickly drive the chariot away from this place.  Even sugar, when consumed excessively, loses its sweetness and becomes unpleasant." ||18-19||

Following her command, the charioteer swiftly drove the chariot towards the Jain temple.  After parking the chariot, Vasudeva and Gandharvasena entered the temple, circumambulated it thrice, and performed an abhisheka (ceremonial bath) of the Jina statue with streams of milk, sugarcane juice, ghee, yogurt, and water.  This was done in honor of the Jina, who was worshipped by humans, gods, and demons. ||20-21||

Both were experts in the rituals of worship.  They offered incense made from sandalwood, fragrant rice, various kinds of exquisite flowers, *kalaguru* (a type of incense), sandalwood-based incense, lamps with bright flames, and flawless offerings to the Jina statue. ||22-23||

After the worship, they prepared for *samayika* (a Jain meditation practice).  First, they stood with their feet together, hands clasped in prayer, facing the Jina statue.  Then, they began to recite the *iryapatha danda* (a Jain text on conduct) in a soft voice, purifying their conduct through *kayotsarga* (a Jain practice of complete relaxation).  ||24||

Page #359:
---------------------------
The Twenty-Second Chapter

The two, highly skilled in the path of purification through the practice of *Kayotsarga*, fell to the ground in prostration. They then rose, purifying themselves by reciting the *Panch Namaskar* mantra. They declared, "The four supreme things in the world are the *Arhat*, the *Siddh*, the *Sadhu*, and the *Kevaliprajnapti Dharma*. These four are auspicious, and we seek refuge in them."

They then said, "To the *Tirthankaras* who were, are, and will be in the three times, in the one hundred and seventy *Dharmakshetras* of the *Ardha-dvipa*, we offer our salutations." With these words, they took the following vows: "As long as we perform *Samayika*, we renounce all *Savady Yoga* and the body." They then renounced attachment to the body and thought, "May I have equanimity towards enemies and friends, pleasure and pain, life and death, gain and loss."

Standing for the duration of seven breaths, they bowed their heads and then recited the beautiful hymn of the twenty-four *Tirthankaras*.

**Hymn of the Twenty-Four Tirthankaras**

O *Rishabhadeva*, salutations to you! O *Ajitanatha*, salutations to you! O *Shambhavanatha*, eternal salutations to you! O *Abhinandanatha*, salutations to you!

O *Sumatinatha*, salutations to you! O *Padma Prabha*, salutations to you! O *Suparshvanatha*, the lord of the world, salutations to you! O *Chandra Prabha*, salutations to you!

O *Pushpadanta*, salutations to you! O *Shitalanatha*, you are the protector, salutations to you! O *Shreyansanatha*, you are the lord of infinite *Chaturshtiya Lakshmi* and the benefactor of dependent beings, salutations to you!

O *Vasupujya*, salutations to you! You are the most revered in the three worlds, and your unshakeable great festival is celebrated in *Champapuri*.

O *Vimalanatha*, salutations to you! O *Anantanatha*, salutations to you! O *Dharmanjinendra*, salutations to you! O *Shantinatha*, the bringer of peace, salutations to you!

O *Kunthunatha*, salutations to you! O *Aranatha*, salutations to you! O *Mallinatha*, you are like a wrestler who destroys the arrows, salutations to you!

Salutations to Harivansh Purana, salutations to Naminaath, the Lord of the three worlds, whose pilgrimage is currently taking place in the land of Bharat. ||37|| Salutations to Arishtanemi, the future Tirthankara, the one who shines like the moon in the vast expanse of Harivansh. ||38|| Salutations to Parshvanath, salutations to Shri Vira, salutations to all the Tirthankaras and their Ganendras. ||39|| Salutations to the artificial and non-artificial temples, salutations to the three-world dwelling Tirthankaras and their images. ||40|| Having performed this praise, Vasudeva and Gandharvasena, their bodies trembling with devotion, bowed down, touching the earth with their foreheads, knees, and hands. ||41|| Then, rising up as before, they performed Kayotsarga and chanted the auspicious Pancha Guru Stotra. ||42|| While chanting the Pancha Guru Stotra, they said, "Salutations to the Arhats, salutations to all the Siddhas, and salutations to all the Acharyas, Upadhyayas, and Sadhus in the entire world." ||43|| After circumambulating the Jain temple, the couple, adorned with beautiful bodies, boarded their chariot and entered the city of Champa with great splendor. ||44|| The infatuation that arose in Vasudeva's eyes upon seeing the dancer was noticed by Gandharvasena, who therefore began to pay her respects. However, Vasudeva subdued her by bowing down to her. ||45|| It is fitting, for even when a husband is guilty of an offense, a wife's respectful bow, born out of affection, removes her anger. ||46|| Then, while Vasudeva was seated in a secluded part of the palace, an old Vidyadhari, sent by the dancing girl, arrived. She was adorned with a Tripunda tilak, was captivating to Vasudeva's mind, and seemed like the embodiment of the knowledge of old age. Upon arriving, she blessed Vasudeva and sat down on a seat facing him, and began to speak. ||47-48|| O valiant one! Although the vastness of the Puranas is reflected in your heart, like a pure mirror, I will still tell you about the Vidyadharas...

## Chapter Twenty-Two

**323**

Even so, I shall narrate the story, relying on the Vidhyadharas. What is not touched by the light of the Lord of Medicines (Moon), can it be touched by ordinary medicines? (i.e., anything touched by the Lord of Medicines can be touched by ordinary medicines). 

**50**

The Lord Vrishabhadeva, the first of the age, who showed the means of livelihood to the world, had been initiated into the kingdom by Bharateshwara. 

**51**

At that time, the fierce Kshatriya kings, descendants of Ugra and Bhoj, along with four thousand others, were engaged in penance. But later, they were corrupted by the Paroshahas. 

**52**

Among them, there were two brothers, Nimi and Vinimi, who were corrupted. They desired the kingdom and stood at the feet of the Lord, seeking it. 

**53**

At that time, the protector of the world, the Jain devotee Dharanendra, along with many Dharanas (divine beings) and his wives, Diti and Aditi, came and comforted Nimi and Vinimi. 

**54**

That great soul, the devotee of the Jinas, gave them the Vidya-kosa (treasure of knowledge) in the presence of the Jina, through his wives. 

**55**

Harivamsha Purana
Hear, O Vinami, with humility and without pride. Those who are illuminated by various knowledge are born, many and auspicious. || 103 || Sanjaya, Arijaya, Shatrunjaya, Dhananjaya, Manichula, Harishmashru, Meghaniaka, Prabhanjana, || 104 || Chudamani, Shatanika, Sahasranika, Sarvajaya, Vajraबाहु, Mahaबाहु, and Arindama, || 105 || etc., these were the ornaments of the northern line, praising. Bhadra, the daughter, Subhadra, the jewel of women, of Bharata. || 106 || Salutations to the daughters born, many and radiant. Ravi, the son of Soma, Puruhuta, Anshuman, Hari, || 107 || Jaya, Pulastya, Vijaya, Matanga, Vasava, etc. The daughter, Kanakapunjashri, the daughter, Kanakamanjari. || 108 || Namich and Vinami, afterwards, in the circle of wise sons, || 109 || having renounced the wealth of the Vidyadharas, they became Jina-initiated. Matanga, the son of Vinami, had many sons. Their sons and grandsons, born, became instruments of liberation. || 110 || In the Tirtha of the twenty-first Jina, a king named Prahasita was born, in the Matanga lineage, in the city of Amitaparbata. || 111 || I, Hiranyavati, am the mother of the learned elder, the sun of the sky of the Matanga lineage, the powerful one. || 112 || My son is named Singhadanshtr, his beloved is Neelanjana. Their daughter, Neelayasha, has the blue hue of a blue lotus, the blue of the blue sky. || 113 || 'Her fame, not blue, but pure, I have described her lineage, adorned with virtues, skills, and qualities. || 114 || O Harivansha, like the moon! The moon-faced one, seen, || 115 || dancing, you, by her, in the great battle of Vasupujya. Your sight, for her, was a cause of happiness, as it was. The cause of sorrow, now, is remembered in separation. || 116 || She does not bathe, she does not eat, she does not speak, she does not move. With the arrow of love, she lives, a great wonder. || 117 ||

After that, King Vinami had many sons, Sanjaya, Arijaya, Shatrunjaya, Dhananjaya, Manichula, Harishmashru, Meghaniaka, Prabhanjana, Chudamani, Shatanika, Sahasranika, Sarvajaya, Vajraबाहु, Mahaबाहु, and Arindama, etc. All these sons were endowed with humility and knowledge of ethics, illuminated by various knowledge, and were the best ornaments of the northern line. Besides sons, he also had two daughters named Bhadra and Subhadra. Among them, Subhadra was one of the fourteen jewels of the Bharata Chakravarti, a jewel of women. || 103 - 106 || Thus, Vinami also had many sons, radiant with great brilliance, Ravi, Soma, Puruhuta, Anshuman, Hari, Jaya, Pulastya, Vijaya, Matanga, and Vasava, etc., and two daughters named Kanakapunjashri and Kanakamanjari. || 107 - 108 || Later, the supremely wise named Namich and Vinami, having renounced the wealth of the Vidyadharas, became detached from the world and both took Jina initiation. || 109 || Among the sons of King Vinami, there was a son named Matanga, who had many sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons, etc., and they went to heaven and liberation according to their own practice. || 110 || In this way, after many days, in the Tirtha of the twenty-first Tirthankara, a king named Prahasita was born in the Matanga lineage, in the city of Asitaparbata. He was very powerful and was like the sun of the sky of the Matanga lineage. I am Hiranyavati, the wife of the learned elder. || 111-112 || My son is named Singhadanshtr, and Neelanjana is his wife. They have a daughter named Neelayasha, whose blue hue is like that of a blue lotus, the blue of the blue sky. I am used to speaking, so I have made an effort to describe the lineage of that daughter, who is adorned with virtues, skills, and many qualities, and who has attained brilliant fame. || 113-114 || O Harivansha, like the moon! That moon-faced daughter came to this Champapuri during the Ashtahnika festival, the festival of worship of Lord Vasupujya, and she was dancing in front of the temple when she saw you. || 115 || O Kumar! Your sight was a cause of happiness for that daughter at that time, just as it is now a cause of sorrow in separation. || 116 || She does not bathe, she does not eat, she does not speak, she does not move. With the arrow of love, she lives, a great wonder. || 117 ||

Harivamsha Purana
"I thought you were Matanga, but I am Hiranyavati. This is the method of achieving the goal in the Matanga Vidya." (130)
"She, having lost her beloved, is withered, her heart is filled with sorrow. This girl wants to bind you with her arms, she wants to embrace you." (131)
Saying this, Hiranyavati pointed to the nearby Nila-yasha and said, "Look, this is the same girl, Nila-yasha, who is withered because she did not get you, who steals hearts. This girl wants to bind you with her arms, she wants to embrace you." (131)
Having said this to the Kumar, Hiranyavati also said to the nearby Nila-yasha, "This is your beloved, touch his hand with your hand." (132)
Thus, having received Hiranyavati's permission, the maiden Nila-yasha took the Kumar Vasudeva's outstretched hand in her own. At that time, both of them were sweating from their bodies due to their touch. (133)
Their love-tree was watered by the water of the pleasure of their bodily touch, therefore it was revealing its hard shoots under the guise of excitement. (134)
Both of them were filled with affection, therefore their first hand-grasping happened at that time, and the practical hand-grasping will happen later. (135)
After that, the entire group of Vidya-dharis, filled with joy, quickly flew up into the sky with Kumar Vasudeva and headed towards the north. (136)
The group of Vidya-dharis, destroying the lineage of darkness with the brilliance of ornaments and medicines, was shining in the sky like a group of lightning. (137)
Just as Kumar Vasudeva had made Nila-yasha's face radiant with his mere touch, in the same way, the sun had also made the face of the woman in the east radiant with its rays. (138)
At that time, the half-risen red sun in the east looked as if it were the red lower lip of the woman in the east, half-bitten by the youth of the day. (139)
A little later, when the sun's disc rose fully, it looked as if it were a golden earring adorning the face of the woman in the east. (140)
Just as Kumar Vasudeva, who illuminated the world, quickly made the sky and the earth clear and his gaze spread towards them, (141)
then Hiranyavati said to Vasudeva, "O Kumar! Look at the high mountain below on the earth, surrounded by the trees of the great forest. People call that beautiful mountain Himanta Giri. This mountain also makes the shy man ashamed." (142)

## Twenty-Second Chapter

329. The celestial being Angarak, the daughter of Shyamayashani, was situated there, having his knowledge broken in battle, seeking to attain knowledge-perfection. ||144||

By seeing you, his knowledge will quickly become perfect. If you wish to do him a favor, then give him your darshan. ||145||

Thus addressed, knowing the well-being of Shyama, he was pleased. He said, "What is the use of seeing Angarak, who is my enemy?" ||146||

"What is the use of these games played with the time-wasters? If you wish to stay, then stay, I am going to see my father-in-law's city." ||147||

"So be it," said she, and taking him, she established him on Asit Parvat. Having made the Vidya-dharis protect him, she placed him in a beautiful outer garden. ||148||

Entering her own city of Neelayasha, with a happy heart, she remained there, longing for his arrival and talking about him. ||149||

Having bathed and adorned with great splendor, he, seated in his chariot, was escorted by the celestial beings into the city, which was like heaven. ||150||

He was seen by the people, with their lion-like teeth, with their father-in-law, Sih-danstra, and with all the inhabitants of the inner palace, with their eyes not satiated, with great respect and honor. ||151||

Then, on a holy day, the auspicious ceremony of the joining of hands of Vasudev and Neelayasha, who were both full of merit and perfect in form, was performed according to the scriptures. ||152||

Thus, in the city of Asit Parvat, Vasudev, with Neelayasha, enjoyed the pleasures of love, just as Kamadev enjoys them with his wife, Rati. ||153||

The Shardaul Vikridit:

The fame of Neelayasha was not tarnished by the women there, because of their virtues, nor was the fame of the valiant Vasudev stained by the celestial beings. ||142-143||

The mountain, adorned with beauty, is called Hri-mant Giri. This mountain makes even a man full of shame, become full of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. ||142-143||

330
In the Harivamsha Purana, only a Shruta Kevali, one who knows the Jina teachings, is capable of describing the complete nature of the happiness and love that existed between Vasudeva and Neelayasha, who were dwelling together. ||154||
Thus ends the twenty-second chapter of the Harivamsha Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which is part of the Arishtanemi Purana Sangraha, and describes the attainment of Neelayasha. ||22||

## Chapter Twenty-Three

Hearing a great commotion from the palace, the attendant, Shouri, asked the woman standing beside him, "Why is the whole world so noisy?" 

The woman, who knew the story, replied, "Listen, Dev! There is a city called Shakatamukha on this mountain. Its king is a Vidyadhara named Neelavan, the lord of the Vidyadharas."

"Neelavan has a son named Neel and a respected daughter named Neelanjana. There was a conversation between the son and daughter, saying, 'If I have a son and you have a daughter, then there will be a marriage without any dispute between the two families, keeping the lineage happy.'"

"Neelanjana was married to your father-in-law, Singhdanstra. From this marriage, a daughter named Neelyasha was born."

"Neel, who had married, had a son named Neelkantha. He asked Singhdanstra for Neelyasha in marriage."

"Following the order of the great sage, Brihaspati, the wise father gave her to you, the half-chakra-emperor."

"The father and son, Neel and Neelkantha, were wicked and resorted to litigation with Singhdanstra in the assembly. But your father-in-law defeated them both in a fair trial. Therefore, the Vidyadharas made a great commotion in the sky."

Hearing the attendant's words, the son of Surya, Vasudev, smiled and stayed with Neelyasha as before.

Then came the rainy season, and Vasudev experienced it like a woman. Just as a woman is embraced by a dense cloud, so too is the rainy season embraced by the clouds. Just as a woman is dear to her possessions, so too is the rainy season dear to the lands. And just as a woman is beautiful with her white complexion, so too is the rainy season beautiful with the sound of peacocks.

Page #370:
---------------------------
Jain Terms Preserved:

In the Harivamsha Purana, the proud and dazzling autumn season, adorned with the beauty of the arrow-like peacock feathers and the humming of the bees, arrived. [13] At that time, the Vidyadharas, restraining the impetuosity of their minds, came out for the perfection of their own sciences and medicines. [14] Then, the two spouses, Vasudeva and Nilayasha, went to the modest mountain, embraced by knowledge, like clouds embracing a mountain and raining according to their will. [15] That mountain had the middle part bearing the wives of the ascetics without rivals, so it seemed to be constantly practicing the extremely difficult Asidharavata. [16] Intoxicated with the drinking of honey, it was filled with the sounds of the drunken birds and bees, so it seemed to be filled with the sounds of the arrows and bowstrings of the god of love. [17] Descending on that mountain, fragrant with the seven-leaved garland, and beautiful in itself, with its trees swaying in the wind, they admired its beauty. After wandering for a long time and not getting satisfied by seeing its beauty, they remembered the pleasant peaks of the mountain in their passion-filled state. [18-19] The excessive indulgence in amorous pleasures on the bed made of flowers and leaves did not cause them any distress at that time. [20] After a long time, they came out of the banana grove, their bodies adorned with the sweat born of the enjoyment of love. [21] As soon as they came out, they saw a peacock there, suddenly uttering its melodious call, with a colorful body, adorned with a crest, and with intoxicated eyes. [22] Seeing that peacock, which had captivated their minds with its beauty, Nilayasha, who was eager and curious, was taken by that peacock, which sat on her shoulder and flew away into the sky. [23-24] That was not actually a peacock, but one who had assumed the form of a peacock.

### 333

The exhausted, hungry, and thirsty Vasudeva, having spent the night in the cowherd's village, rose in the morning and set out towards the south.  He saw a city, Giritarat, surrounded by a thorny rampart, and, delighted, entered it.  The city was filled with distinguished people, and the sound of Vedic chanting filled all directions.  Curious, Vasudeva asked someone, "Has a great gift been given to the Brahmanas here?  Why have all the Vedic scholars of the earth gathered here?"

The man replied, "There lives here a Brahmana named Vasudeva, who has a daughter named Somashri, beautiful as the moon, and skilled in the arts and the Vedas."

"The astrologers have said that whoever wins her in a debate on the Vedas will be her husband.  Therefore, all the Vedic people have gathered here."

"This extremely beautiful girl, with her heavy hips and breasts, and slender waist, is a burden for which we do not know who will be fortunate enough to bear."

Hearing these words, the girl, whose voice was as sweet as the sound of a swan, was filled with anxiety, just as the sound of a swan's cry fills the heart of a swan with anxiety.

Vasudeva, approaching the teacher Brahmadutta, declared his lineage and requested, "Please teach me the Vedas."

The teacher replied, "Do you wish to learn the Ashan Vedas, which reveal Dharma, or the Anarsh Vedas?"

"How can there be two Vedas?" asked Vasudeva.

The teacher, delighted and truthful, replied, "At the beginning of the Kalpa, when the Kalpa trees perished, those who taught the six actions (Ashi, Mashi, etc.) to the people who had taken refuge in them, and who, based on their previous knowledge, divided them into the three varnas (Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shudra), were the ones who ruled.

The king who ruled over the earth, whose wife was adorned with a silver mountain necklace, was the one who had the power to control the Himalayas and the Vindhyas.

##  Harivamsha Purana (Chapter 334)

**38.**  "He who, having renounced the world, established a hundred sons as kings, beginning with Bharata, and then, with four thousand kings, took initiation."

**39.** "He who, self-realized, was a great hero, a conqueror of enemies, and, having mastered the four Vedas, performed severe austerities for a thousand years."

**40.** "He who, having attained the supreme knowledge, saw all things with the eye of wisdom, and, through the path of righteousness, made the field of Dharma free from evil."

**41.** "The sage showed two paths of Dharma: the path of the householder and the path of the monk, for the attainment of heavenly bliss and liberation."

**42.** "He established the twelve-fold Angas of the Vedas and described the conduct of householders within them, including those who follow the principles of *guna* and *shiksha* vows and adhere to numerous rules."

**43.** "The Vedas revealed by Rishabhadeva, the Lord, are called *Aapa* Vedas, because they were revealed by him."

**44.** "The entire group of Brahmanas, honored by Bharata Chakravarti in the beginning of the age, studied these *Aapa* Vedas and performed righteous acts, sacrifices, and other rituals according to the methods described in them."

**45.** "Now, the origin of the *Anaarsha* Vedas, which are followed by the Brahmanas of this age, is described. These are the Vedas in which the Brahmanas of the *Aida* age are engaged."

**46.** "In the city of *Dharana-yugma*, there was a king who was called *Ayodhana* by the warriors because he was a great warrior in the battlefield."

**47.** "The queen of Ayodhana, who adorned the solar dynasty, was named Diti. She was the daughter of the lunar dynasty and the younger sister of King Trina-vindu of the lunar dynasty."

**48.** "Queen Diti gave birth to a daughter named Sulasa, who was like a treasure chest of feminine virtues. When she reached the age of marriage, her father arranged her *Swayamvara* (self-choice of husband)."

**49.** "Kings from all over the earth, including Sagar, who were renowned for their glory, eager for the *Swayamvara*, and full of respect, came to the ceremony."

**50.** "One day, Mandodari, the gatekeeper, went to Queen Diti's house. There, she heard Diti say in private, "My dear Sulasa, you are very dear to me because you are my daughter."

Page #373:
---------------------------
Chapter Twenty-Three: O Sulasa! Listen to my words, you who are devoted to your mother. The affection of a mother is expressed through her milk.  

A son named Madhupingala, born to the queen Sarvayashadevi, from the elder brother, King Trinavindu, stands above all kings in his splendor. He is the most beautiful and powerful. 

I had already decided in my mind to give you to him. Therefore, fulfill my wish in the Swayamvara. 

Saying this, Sulasa, with tears in her eyes, spoke to her mother. "Mother, don't cry. I will do what is pleasing to you in the presence of the kings. I will marry Madhupingala as you wish."

Hearing all this, Mandodari went in secret and informed King Sagara, who was eager to obtain the girl. 

Then, King Sagara quickly summoned his priest, Vishvabhuthi, and had him prepare a scripture in secret, which described the characteristics of men. 

He had it blackened with smoke, placed in an iron casket, and buried in the ground of the Swayamvara. When the day of the Swayamvara arrived, Sagara had the iron casket dug up and the scripture taken out. He showed it to the kings. 

The kings who had come for the Swayamvara wanted to hear about the characteristics of men. So, the priest read the scripture aloud to them. 

It said that the feet of a king are marked with the signs of a fish, conch, and goad. Their middle part is like the inner part of a lotus. They are adorned with excellent beauty, their toes are close together, their nails are smooth and red, their ankles are hidden, they are free of veins, somewhat warm, raised like a tortoise, and covered in sweat. 

The feet of a wicked man are shaped like a broom, spread out, full of veins, crooked, with rough nails, dry, and with sparse toes. 

Feet that are full of holes and have a reddish color are considered to be destroyers of lineage. The feet of a violent man are like burnt clay, and the feet of an angry man are yellow. 

Those whose calves are thin, covered in very strong hair, and round at the top, whose knees are good, and whose thighs are round, are...

Page #374:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, it is said that a single hair grows in the hair follicle of a righteous person, two hairs in the hair follicle of a wise person, and three or more hairs in the hair follicle of a fool and a poor person. The same principle applies to the hair on the head.

If a child's penis is small, slightly curved to the right, and has a thick knot, it is considered auspicious. The opposite is considered inauspicious.

Men with very small testicles die young, those with uneven testicles (one small, one large) have power over women, those with equal testicles become kings, and those with testicles that hang down are long-lived.

Men who urinate with a sound are happy, while those who urinate silently are unhappy. Those whose first and second streams of urine flow to the right are masters of Lakshmi (wealth), while those whose streams flow in the opposite direction are poor.

A man with a thick buttocks is poor, a man with a well-developed buttocks is happy, and a man with a buttocks that is high like a frog's will die by a tiger.

A man with a waist like a lion's is a king, and a man with a waist like a monkey's or a camel's is wealthy. A man with a stomach that is neither small nor large but equal is happy, while a man with a stomach like a pot or a jug is unhappy.

Men with full ribs are happy, while those with thin and crooked ribs are without enjoyment. Men with low chests are without enjoyment, those with even chests are enjoyers, those with raised chests are kings, and those with uneven chests are poor. Men with a long stomach like a snake are poor and eat a lot.

A man with a navel that is wide, high, deep, and round is happy, while a man with a small and barely visible navel is a recipient of suffering.

If the lines in the middle of the body are uneven, they cause pain and poverty. If the same lines are swirling to the left and right, they bring about excellent intelligence.

A navel like the stigma of a lotus makes a man a king, and a navel that is wide above, below, and around makes a man wealthy.

**337**  A man with one *vali* is a scholar, with two *vali* is a lover of women, with three *vali* is a teacher, with four *vali* is a father of many children, and a man with no *vali* is a king. ||5||

Those with straight *vali* are content with their wives, while those with uneven *vali* are unapproachable, sinful, and low-born. ||7||

Men with strong, soft, and clockwise-curving hair on their backs are kings, while those with the opposite are servants. ||7||

Men with small and thick breasts are fortunate, while those with long or uneven breasts are poor. ||78||

Kings have strong, wide, high, and steady hearts, while the hearts of the wicked are the opposite, filled with sharp diseases. ||79||

Those with even chests are wealthy, those with thick chests are brave but poor, and those with thin and uneven chests are poor and die by the sword. ||80||

A man with thick knees is wealthy, with high knees is a pleasure-seeker, with deep and bone-bound knees is poor, and with uneven knees is uneven in all things. ||81||

The armpits of the wealthy are always free of sweat, strong, high, fragrant, and covered in even hair. ||82||

The neck of the poor is flat, dry, and full of veins. In contrast, a man with a conch-like neck is a king, and a man with a buffalo-like neck is a brave warrior. ||83||

A back without hair and straight is considered auspicious, while a back covered in hair and very bent is not considered good. ||84||

The shoulders of the poor are small, weak, drooping, and covered in hair, while the shoulders of the powerful and wealthy are close together and strong. ||85||

The hands of kings are thick, even, long, and like an elephant's trunk, while the hands of the poor are small and hairy. ||86||

The fingers of long-lived men are long and soft. The fingers of the fortunate are short and fine, while the fingers of the intelligent are fine. ||87||

### 339

The face of a womanless man is low and feminine. The face of a miser is short, and the face of a wealthy man is long. || 100 ||

Kings have nail-like ears, while those with hair on their ears have long lives. Those with straight, even-ridged noses and small nostrils are pleasure-seekers. || 101 ||

Those who sneeze once are wealthy, those who sneeze twice or thrice are learned, and those who sneeze continuously are long-lived. || 102 ||

Those with red-rimmed eyes like lotus petals are blessed with wealth and fortune. Those with eyes like an elephant or a bull are kings. || 103 ||

Those with reddish eyes are inauspicious and sinful. One should never speak to them or look at them, especially. || 104 ||

Those with cat-like eyes are always filled with mental, verbal, and physical sins. They are considered wicked, unfortunate, cruel, and sinful. || 105 ||

When considering the qualities and defects of all signs, the sign of the eye is sufficient for determining the outcome. || 106 ||

A wise person should observe a person's pride, arrogance, body, gait, lineage, good qualities, and nature to determine their future. || 107 ||

As this book was being read, Madhupingala, fearing a defect in his eyes, left the assembly. || 108 ||

Leaving behind the beautiful Sulasa, Madhupingala, a young man, renounced the world and, embracing the life of a monk, wandered through various lands. || 109 ||

Meanwhile, the clever King Sagara, obtaining the beautiful Sulasa with eyes like lotuses in her swayamvara, enjoyed happiness. || 110 ||

The teacher says that such a course of action may be considered clever at the time, but it does not remain hidden forever. Therefore, the person who does this will inevitably face adverse consequences in the future - they will suffer the bad fruit of their actions. || 111 ||

Later, at noon, the Digambara Madhupingala, who had renounced all attachments, arrived in a certain city for his midday meal. || 112 ||

In the Harivamsha Purana,
The sage's body, from feet to head, was examined.
With a shaking head, he exclaimed in great wonder,
"Even a sesame seed's worth of flaw cannot be found in this muni's body,
By the pure vision of the Samudra Shastra." || 163 ||
"Even if there were a flaw, O sage,
It would not be seen by the pure vision of the Samudra Shastra." || 114 ||
"Let this cluster of auspicious signs remain aside,
His honey-colored eyes alone indicate his kingdom and fortune." || 115 ||
"Even with such auspicious signs,
Why does this young man wander about begging?
This Samudra Shastra is a curse!" || 116 ||
"If fate has destined him to suffer,
Why was he blessed with such a multitude of auspicious signs?" || 117 ||
"Or perhaps, those who desire happiness,
Fear suffering and do not touch prosperity,
Like a poisonous vine laden with fruit." || 118 ||
"For one who is full of auspicious signs,
And of pure lineage,
It is fitting that he should be content with his initiation,
And strive for liberation." || 119 ||
Having heard the words of the Samudra Shastra expert,
A man said to him,
"Have you not heard of his Samudra Shastra?
It is renowned throughout the world." || 120 ||
"At the Swayamvara of Sulasa,
The wicked kings gathered together,
And declared him unfit for the assembly,
Saying, 'He lacks the auspicious signs in his eyes.'" || 121 ||
"Just as a slanderer, who speaks ill of others behind their backs,
And a self-praiser, are condemned,
So too is this Pingala,
He is full of flaws." || 122 ||
"This Madhupingala was naive,
And accepted the opinions of others,
Therefore, even though he had auspicious eyes,
He considered himself to be flawed,
And in shame, he took to asceticism." || 123 ||
"Those who, due to carelessness, laziness, and pride,
Do not study the scriptures themselves,
Are deceived by cunning people,
In matters both seen and unseen." || 124 ||
"After Madhupingala left,
The princess chose King Sagara in the Swayamvara,
And surrounded by a group of Kshatriyas,
She indulges in pleasures." || 125 ||

**341**

Hearing this, Madhupingala, consumed by great anger, died and was reborn as Mahakola, a low-born Vyantara deva, in the realm of the earth. **126**

Oh, the disparity of the consumption of kṣaya! How it contaminates the medicine of right-conduct! **127**

Remembering the abduction of Sulasa by Sagara, with his schemes and his army, Mahakola burned fiercely in his heart with the fire of anger. **128**

His heart, scorched by the poison of hatred for women, was burning intensely. He was unable to quench the fire with the water of peace. **129**

He thought, "I will employ the means by which a long chain of suffering is born for the enemy." **130**

The Acharya says, "This being strives to harm his enemy with those means by which the foolish one himself falls into lower realms." **131**

Thus, Mahakola, blazing with anger towards the Kshatriyas, arrived on earth. Upon arrival, he saw the mountain that had been defeated by Narada in a debate. **132**

Assuming the form of a Shaandilya, he assured the mountain, "Oh mountain! Do not be distressed that I was defeated in the debate." **133**

"I am Shaandilya, a disciple of the teacher Dhrouchana. You are Kshirakadamba, and your father is Vaanya. Udacha and Praavrit are also my disciples, making a total of five." **134**

"You are the son of Kshirakadamba, so your defeat is my defeat. Therefore, I am determined to rectify it." **135**

"With my help, make your territory free from thorns. What is difficult for the fierce, fiery one, the friend of the wind?" **136**

Thus, Mahakola, with his wicked mind, spoke to the mountain and, placing him in the forefront, made the entire Bharat region, along with its kings, afflicted with hundreds of diseases. **137**

The mountain performed peace rituals to destroy those diseases, and people, trusting him, sought refuge in him. **138**

In the Harivamsha Purana, King Sagara, along with the Kshatriya clan, went to the Tamodara (Mahakal) and, following the prescribed rituals of the Homa and mantras, was cured of his fever. ||139|| The wicked Mahakal, driven by a desire for violence, taught the Brahmanas the non-Vedic scriptures he had created himself, and quickly brought them under his control. ||140|| He showed the Kshatriyas and others who desired the fruits of sacrifice, the Ashvamedha, Ajamedha, and Go-medha sacrifices. ||141|| The Rajasuya sacrifice, in which hundreds and thousands of kings participated, was also shown by Mahakal, the enemy of kings. ||142|| Although the celestial being named Pragdiwakaradeva, accompanied by Narada, was eager to obstruct Mahakal's evil deeds, the celestial illusion thwarted his efforts. ||143|| Indeed, what can a human being, even if endowed with the power of knowledge, do when a wicked celestial being, possessing the extraordinary qualities of Anima, etc., is determined to act? ||144|| This wicked celestial being, who caused harm to himself and others, had many beings killed by the Brahmanas and others who were eager to obey him, and then offered them in sacrifice. Not only that, but he also offered King Sagara and Sulasa in sacrifice, and thus, attaining the fierce meditation known as Hinsa-ananda, he departed to his own abode. ||145-146|| The Mahakal, filled with anger, set in motion those non-Vedic scriptures, and they spread throughout the earth, supported by mountains and other features. ||147|| Narada had a son who possessed perfect vision. The celestial being named Pragdiwakaradeva gave him his own supremely auspicious daughter, endowed with knowledge. ||148|| In that lineage, a noble daughter named Somashri was born to the Brahman Vasudeva from a Kshatriya wife. ||149|| The sage Karalabrahmadutta, who possessed divine vision, had declared that she would be the wife of the great man who would conquer her in the Vedas. ||150|| Hearing this, the noble Kumar Vasudeva studied all the Vedas at that time, and, having conquered Somashri, married her according to the prescribed rituals. ||151|| Just as the newlywed bride had a strong love for Kumar Vasudeva, so too did Kumar Vasudeva have a strong love for his new bride. Therefore, their...

153. The noble hero (nṛvara vara) kissed her breasts, pulled her hair, scratched her hips, and struck her lower lip, but the love-sick Somaśrī did not feel any such disturbance.

154. He was a young man who was superior to the Vidyādharas in his personal qualities and virtues, who wandered with the Vidyādhara companions, who was extremely skilled in the art of love, and who was the companion of the beautiful-minded lady. In the city on the bank of the mountain, he extensively sported with the independent and Jina-devoted lady Somaśrī.

Chapter Twenty-Four:

Once, while Indra Sharma was teaching him, Shouri, the prince, was studying in the garden at night, when he was abducted by some rogues. ||1||

He was taken in a palanquin to a distant place. From there, Vasudeva went to the city of Tilavastu. ||2||

He slept in the garden outside the Chaitya-griha at night. He was awakened by a man-eating man, like a Rakshasa. ||3||

"Hey! Wake up! Wake up! Who are you sleeping here? You have fallen into my mouth, like a hungry tiger." ||4||

Shouri, the valiant, woke up from the terrible sound. When the man-eating man was about to kill him with his arm, he struck him with his own arms. ||5||

The battle between the two, who possessed great strength, shook the earth. Their battle was terrifying, with the loud sound of their fists striking each other. ||6||

Vasudeva, being very strong, killed the demon-like man in a wrestling match after a long battle, leaving him lifeless. ||7||

When morning came, the people of the city, carrying Vasudeva, the destroyer of man-eaters, who possessed excellent valor, on a chariot, brought him into the city and honored him greatly. ||8||

Kumar Vasudeva stayed there, having obtained five hundred girls, who were adorned with beauty, family, and character. ||9||

"Where did this wicked man, who eats human flesh, come from?" When Vasudeva asked this, the elders told him this story. ||10||

In the city of Kanchanpur, in the Kalinga country, there was a king named Jitashatru, who was famous for conquering groups of enemies. ||11||

He was a king whose orders were never disobeyed. He ruled his country with justice, he desired to stay away from killing living beings, and he declared that all beings should be free from harm. ||12||

Chapter Twenty-Four:

Soudas, the son of the king, was a great lover of meat. He obtained permission from his father to eat peacock meat.  [13] Every day, the cook prepared peacock meat for him, and he would eat it in secret within the palace. [14] One day, a cat stole the prepared meat, and the cook went out of the city to search for it. There, he saw a dead child and brought it back, preparing it well and giving it to Soudas. Soudas ate the meat with great pleasure and politely asked the cook whose meat it was. [15-16] The cook replied, "O noble one, I have eaten many meats before, but none of them even come close to the taste of this one." [17] "Tell me the truth, good man! You have nothing to fear from me."  Thus urged, the cook, guided by his conscience, revealed his actions to Soudas. [18] Hearing this, Soudas praised the cook and said, "I am very pleased with you. Bring me human meat every day." [19]

After his father's death, Soudas ascended the throne, and the cook, using a cunning plan, began killing children every day. [20] Seeing the loss of one child every day, the people of the city were alarmed. They investigated and discovered that Soudas was a child-eater. They quickly expelled him from the country. [21] Now, he lurks like a tiger, snatching humans at night and spending his days in the forest. What can a man consumed by vice not do? [22] O Kumar! This is the same Soudas who terrified the people. He was invincible to us, but you, possessing extraordinary power, have sent him to Yama's abode today. [23]

Thus, the elders of the city, having recounted Soudas's evil deeds, honored Vasudeva with clothes, garlands, and ornaments. [24] Then, leaving that place, Kumar Vasudeva obtained the daughter of the merchant of Achalgram, named Vanamala, and married her. From there, he went to Vedasampur with Vanamala. [25]

346
In the Harivamsha Purana, the king of that city, having won the battle, married the daughter of Kapila, named Kapila, according to the proper rites. ||26|| He was greatly pleased with his brother-in-law, Anshuman, and while living there, he had a son named Kapila, born to Kapila. ||27|| One day, the same Neelakantha, who had previously abducted Nila-Yasha, came to Vedasampura in the form of a gandha-hasti (a fragrant elephant). When Vasudeva mounted him to bind him, he carried him up into the sky. Seeing this, Vasudeva struck him hard with his fists, causing him to lose his gandha-hasti form and become Neelakantha again, out of grief. ||28|| Vasudeva slowly fell into the water of the pond and, without any worry, left the forest and went to the city of Shalaguha. ||29|| There, he received the daughter named Padmavati, who was skilled in archery. From there, he went to Jaipur and, defeating the king there, he also obtained his daughter. ||30|| From there, he went with his brother-in-law, Anshuman, to the great city of Bhadrailpur. There, at that time, King Paundra ruled. He had a beautiful daughter named Charuhaasini. Due to the effect of divine medicine, she always maintained the appearance of a young woman. Vasudeva came to know about this and married this extremely beautiful woman. ||31-32|| After some time, he had a son named Paundra, born to her, who was worthy of Lakshmi. One night, while Vasudeva was sleeping, his enemy, Angarak, abducted him in the form of a swan. ||33|| When he escaped, he slowly fell from the sky into the Ganges River. After crossing it, when he reached the shore, he saw the city of Ilavadhan at dawn. ||34|| There, he sat on a fine seat provided by a merchant in a shop. As soon as he sat down, the shop filled with wealth in an instant. ||35|| Understanding this to be the effect of Vasudeva, the merchant took him to his home and, there, gave him his daughter, Ratnavati, who was blessed with wealth, for the fortunate young Vasudeva. ||36|| Vasudeva lived there, enjoying continuous divine pleasures with Ratnavati. Later, he went to the great city of Mahapur to see the Indra-Dhwaja (Indra's flag). ||37|| There, he saw many large palaces outside the city and asked a man who had built them and for what purpose. ||38|| The man said that King Somadatta had built them for his

## Chapter Thirty-Four

347. The king, Somadatta, had built many beautiful palaces for the kings who had come for the swayamvara of his daughter. ||39||

But the princess, for some reason, became averse to the swayamvara, and all the kings were dismissed. ||40||

Hearing this, Kumar Vasudeva, pondering the state of the princess's mind, went to see the Indra flag, and as he sat there, the king's wives, accompanied by their guards, suddenly arrived. ||41||

After paying their respects to the Indra flag, they departed for their homes. ||42||

At that moment, a maddened elephant, breaking its chains, charged towards the people like death itself. ||43||

The sound of the people being killed and the cries of those witnessing the carnage filled all ten directions. ||44||

The enraged elephant, with great speed, approached the chariots of the women, causing one of them to fall to the ground in fear. ||45||

Seeing this, Kumar Vasudeva, calming the elephant, protected the frightened princess, and, in the sight of all, played with the elephant. ||46||

After the elephant tired, he left it and comforted the princess, who had fainted in fear. She looked at Vasudeva, the bearer of a beautiful form, and sighed deeply, her eyes filled with tears. Overcome with shyness, she took his hand, which brought her joy. ||47-48||

Then, Vasudeva returned to his place, and the old nurse and the elder women of the family took the princess back to the inner palace. ||49||

Later, Kumar Vasudeva, adorned with jewels, was sitting in the house of Kubera Datta, when the gatekeeper, by order of the king, came and said, "O Dev! You must know that the king here is Somadatta, and his queen is known as Purnacandra. ||50-51||

They have a son named Bhurishrava and a daughter named Somashri. The king had called many kings for the swayamvara of his daughter, Somashri. ||52||

But Somashri, sitting on the roof of the palace at night, saw the arrival of the gods, and remembering her lineage, fainted, overcome with love. ||53||

In the Harivamsha Purana, the one who had attained the state of knowledge (labdha-samjna) became absorbed in meditation on her celestial husband. She gave up the desire for bathing and eating, and observed the vow of silence (maunavrata) ॥54॥ With difficulty, she narrated to me in private that in her previous birth, she had played with the deity. She was born from the lineage of the deity who had previously departed, and this goddess recognized him from the words of the Kevali (omniscient) ॥55-56॥ And the reunion with the husband, who had the power to destroy the elephant's fear, was known to her. Now, in the current dialogue, she desires your union ॥57॥ Knowing this from my words, the king has sent me to you. O gentle one! May you perform the auspicious marriage rite with Somasri ॥58॥
Thus, having revealed the connection from the previous birth, Vasudeva, the son of Andhakavrishti, was pleased and married the desired Somasri, the daughter of Somadatta, who was his beloved from the past life ॥59॥ For some time, they enjoyed the fragrance of their lotus-like faces and the nectar, as the time passed happily for Somasri and Vasudeva ॥60॥ But once, during the night, a celestial being (khecara) stole away Somasri, who was resting on the arm of her husband ॥61॥ The awakened husband, extremely distressed, called out to Somasri, "Where have you gone? Come back, come back!" ॥62॥ The one who had taken Somasri away sent his sister, who had assumed Somasri's form, and she stood there saying, "I am here." Vasudeva saw the sister in Somasri's form ॥63॥ When asked why she had gone out, she, like Somasri herself, replied that she had gone out for the sake of dharma and peace ॥64॥ The Shouri (Vasudeva), captivated by her form, took her, who had discarded her maiden form, and made her his companion ॥65॥ She would sleep while the husband slept, and before he woke up, she would massage his thighs and feet ॥66॥

74. Then, on his instruction, I came to inform you. But I have become your wife due to the wonderful workings of the mind. ||74||

## Chapter Twenty-Fifth

Once, Dadhimukh, the brother of Madanvega, seeking to free his father from bondage, approached Kumar Vasudeva and spoke as follows:  ||1||

"Hear, O Dev! In the lineage of the Namis, there were countless kings. Among them, the ruler of Arijanapura was King Meghnad. ||2|| He had a daughter named Padmashri. The celestial seers had prophesied that she would be the queen of a Chakravarti. ||3|| At that time, the king of Nabhastilaka, known as Vajrapani, desired her hand in marriage. ||4|| But when he failed to obtain her, he, the wicked Vidhyadhara, became enraged and challenged him to war. Meghnad was a powerful warrior, and Vajrapani could not defeat him. Thus, he returned to his city, unsuccessful. ||4-5||

At that time, some Muni-rajas attained the vision of Kevalgyan. A gathering of humans, gods, and Dharanendras assembled to worship them. In that assembly, Meghnad, worshipping the Kevali Bhagwan, asked, "O Lord! Who will be the husband of my daughter in this Bharat Kshetra?"  ||6-7||

The Kevali Muni-raja, in response, described the worthy groom and his lineage. ||6-7||

He said, "In Hastinapur, born in the Kuru lineage, was a king named Kartavirya, who was very powerful. ||8|| He killed the sage Jamdagni, driven by greed for the Kamadhenu. Jamdagni's son, Parashuram, was also very strong. In his anger, he killed Kartavirya, the slayer of his father. ||9|| His anger did not subside. He, in his rage, killed many Kshatriyas, along with their wives and children, in battle. ||10|| At that time, Kartavirya's pregnant wife, Tara, fearing for her life, secretly left and went to the ashram of the sage Kaushika. ||10-11||

There, in fear, Queen Tara gave birth to a son who would destroy the terror of the Kshatriyas. He was the eighth Chakravarti. ||12||

The Harivamsha Purana states:

**13.** Because he was born in the subterranean dwelling, he came to be known as Subhūmi. He is now secretly growing up in the delightful hermitage of Kausika.

**14.** He, the powerful one, will be the slayer of Jamadagni, the lord of six divisions, and he will be the husband of your daughter in a few days.

**15.** Parashurama, who is like Yama, the god of death, has destroyed the Kshatriyas seven times, and now he is devoted to the welfare of the Brahmanas.

**16.** Thus, Parashurama, who has filled the entire earth with his fiery prowess and fulfilled the desires of the supplicants by giving them whatever they wished, is continuously growing in power.

**17.** As Subhūmi, who resides in the hermitage of the ascetics, grows, hundreds of calamities have begun to occur in the house of Jamadagni.

**18.** Fearing these calamities and filled with wonder, he asked the astrologer, "What misfortune do these calamities portend for me?"

**19.** The astrologer said, "Your enemy is growing secretly somewhere. How can he be identified?" When Parashurama asked this, the astrologer replied,

**20.** "He is your arrogant enemy, whose teeth, when he eats, turn into milk-like food for the Kshatriyas you have slain."

**21.** Hearing this, Parashurama, eager to know his enemy, the best among the Kshatriyas, quickly built a large alms-house.

**22.** He placed a vessel filled with teeth in the middle of the alms-house and appointed a supervisor who was well-informed about the situation and remained there diligently.

**23.** Hearing all this, King Meghanada, after paying homage to the Kevali, quickly went to Hastinapura and saw the young Subhūmi.

**24.** At that time, Subhūmi, the prince, was standing on the shore of the ocean of weapons and scriptures, adorned with great splendor, his radiant prowess spreading everywhere, and he looked like the rising sun.

**25.** Just as the wind kindles the fire to consume the fuel, so too, King Meghanada, the narrator of the past events, slowly inspired him to burn the fuel of his enemy.

**26.** He then went to the house of his enemy, along with him, eager to devour him, and sat down, taking a seat made of darbha grass.

'The vessel containing the teeth was placed before the son of the twice-born, who was seated in the front. Due to its influence, the teeth transformed into payasa (milk pudding). ||27||

Then, the attendants quickly informed Rama. He, eager to kill, arrived with an axe in his hand. ||28||

While the king, Subhauma, was happily enjoying the payasa, Rama tried to kill him. But due to the merit of Subhauma, the vessel transformed into a chakra (discus). With this, he quickly killed Rama. ||29||

Subhauma became the eighth Chakravarti. Fourteen jewels, nine treasures, and thirty-two thousand kings adorned with crowns served him. ||30||

Pleased with the acquisition of the jewel of women, the Chakravarti Subhauma made Megha-nada the king of the Vidyadharas. Empowered by this, he killed Vajra-panika. ||31||

Then, being a cheat against a cheat, the enraged Chakravarti Subhauma, with the chakra jewel, made the earth devoid of Brahmanas twenty-one times. ||32||

Subhauma, the Chakravarti, lived for sixty thousand years but did not attain satisfaction. Therefore, at the end of his life, he died and went to the seventh hell. ||33||

'In the lineage of Megha-nada, Bali, the lord of three parts, became a powerful enemy due to his knowledge and strength. ||34||

Then, Nanda and Pundarika, the holders of the plough and the discus, were present. Bali was killed in battle by these two, who were extremely powerful. ||35||

In the lineage of Bali, there were many Vidyadhara kings, starting with Sahasra-griva, Pancha-shat-griva, and Dwi-shat-griva. O Yadava, Vidyut-vega was born. He is our father and your father-in-law. ||36-37||

Once, King Vidyut-vega asked the sage, who knew the future, "O Bhagavan, who will be the husband of our daughter Madan-vega?" ||38||

The sage said, "Your son, Chanda-vega, will be practicing his knowledge at night, standing in the Ganga. Whoever falls on his shoulder will be the husband of your daughter." ||39||

Knowing this, the father made his son Chanda-vega practice his knowledge in the Ganga. ||40||

Harivamsha Purana
The wicked Trishikha, the king of Nabhatilaka city, had repeatedly requested this girl for his son Suryakaya, but he did not get her. ||41|| Therefore, he always held a grudge. One day, he found an opportunity in the battle, bound our father and imprisoned him. ||42|| Now, you, who possess great strength, have come to us. Therefore, quickly release your father-in-law from the bondage of the enemy. ||43|| O Lord! Accept the divine weapons given by the benevolent Subhauma Chakravarti to our ancestors, with the desire to destroy the enemy. ||44|| Hearing the words of Dadhimukha, the powerful Vasudeva decided in his mind to rescue his father-in-law. ||45|| Then, Chandavega, in accordance with the rituals, bestowed upon the young Vasudeva many divine weapons, which were always served by the gods. ||46|| Among them, some of the divine weapons are named Brahma-shira, Lokotsadan, Agneya, Varuna, Mahendra, Vaishnava, Yamadanda, Aishana, Stambhana, Mohana, Vayavya, Jrimbhana, Bandhana, Mokshana, Vishalyakarana, Vrana-rohana, Sarvastra-chhadana, Chhedana and Harana. ||47-49|| Thus, Chandavega gave Kumar Vasudeva many other divine weapons along with their methods of use and restraint, and he accepted them with respect. ||50|| At that time, the wicked Trishikha, filled with excessive strength and eager for battle, quickly arrived near the city of Chandavega with his armies. ||51|| Seeing that the one he was going to bind had come to him, Vasudeva, pleased with this, went out with his army of in-laws, etc. ||52|| Amidst the throng of Vidyadharas, Vasudeva shone like Indra amidst the assembly of celestial beings. ||53|| And Trishikha, amidst the assembly of Matanga Vidyadharas in the sky, shone like Chamarendra amidst the fierce Asuras. ||54|| The sky was covered with the large chariots, intoxicated elephants, and swift horses of both armies. ||55|| The rays of the weapons, which had covered the rays of the sun, and the sound of trumpets, etc.,

## Chapter Twenty-Five

A fierce battle erupted in the sky between the two armies, their weapons clashing like a web of thunder. The sounds of war drums and trumpets filled the air.  || 56 ||

Arrows released from bows stretched taut to the ear pierced the outer bodies of the warriors, but their inner hearts remained untouched. || 57 ||

In the battle, the sharp blades of the spinning wheels severed the heads of the valiant warriors, but their glory, pure as the moon and conch shell, remained undimmed. || 58 ||

Da, struck by the edge of a sword, fell unconscious in the battle, but his prowess, honed in countless wars, remained undeterred. || 59 ||

The blow of a mighty mace made the arrogant warrior's eyes spin, but his mind, hungry for the victory that was his rightful prey, remained unfazed. || 60 ||

The army of elephants, horses, chariots, and foot soldiers, each fighting with their own unique skill and courage, engaged in battle like a well-oiled machine, fulfilling their individual desires. || 61 ||

Warriors who had previously celebrated their victories with ordinary weapons now fought relentlessly, their bodies free from the fatigue of battle. || 62 ||

The valiant leaders of the enemy army, Saukaanga, Aagari, Vegaari, and Neelakanth, were all defeated by the swift and powerful Chandavega. || 63 ||

Then, the fearsome Trishikha, riding a chariot drawn by swift horses and armed with a variety of weapons, approached Vasudeva, whose chariot was driven by Dadhimuka. || 64 ||

The two armies, their arrows filling the sky and reaching the limits of the horizon, initially engaged in a fierce battle with ordinary weapons. But Vasudeva, the archer, quickly unleashed the Agniya weapon, whose fiery flames instantly engulfed the enemy army. || 65-66 ||

The enemy countered by extinguishing the Agniya weapon with the Vaaruna weapon and then used the powerful Mohana weapon to confuse Vasudeva's army. || 67 ||

Vasudeva, however, dispelled the Mohana weapon with the Chittaprasadana weapon and then destroyed the Vaaruna weapon with the Vaayavya weapon, all while soaring through the sky. || 68 ||

With lightning speed, Vasudeva countered each of his opponent's weapons and then, with the Maheendra weapon, severed the head of the enemy warrior. || 69 ||

As the sun sets, its rays disappear from the sky, and the remaining warriors, abandoning their hopes, retreated from the battlefield. || 70 ||

In the Harivamsha Purana, thereafter, Shouri, surrounded by all his own celestial beings, freed his father-in-law from the prison and returned to his own city. ||7||

**Doddhakavrittam**

Even the most difficult and inaccessible realms, with the help of many valiant celestial beings, are quickly conquered by a person who has embraced the Jain Dharma, and thus many people find refuge in him. ||72||

Thus ends the twenty-fifth chapter of the Harivamsha Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which narrates the attainment of Madanvega and the slaying of Trishikhara, and is a collection of the Arishta-nemi Purana. ||25||

Just as the radiant Trishikhara sets, the remaining Vidyadharas, losing their brilliance, disappear and vanish. ||70|| Thereafter, Vasudeva, surrounded by all the Vidyadharas on his side, freed his father-in-law from the prison and returned to his own city. ||71||

Gautama Swami says that by the grace of the Jain Dharma, a powerful man, with the help of many groups of Vidyadharas, quickly conquers all his enemies, who are difficult to overcome, and thus many people find refuge in him, becoming his devotees. Therefore, one should always worship the Jain Dharma. ||72||

## Chapter Twenty-Six

**1.**  In the lineage of Shouri, Madanvega had a son named Anaavrusti, who was as handsome as Kamadeva, a master of policy, and strong. 

**2.**  One day, the Vidyaadharas, along with their wives, went to the Siddhakoota Jinalaya to pay their respects. Shouri, accompanied by Madanvega, also went there.

**3.**  After paying homage to the Jina, they went to the image-house and, assuming various forms, took shelter under the pillars, as was appropriate.

**4.**  Vidyuudvega, adorned with splendor, also worshipped the Lord and, along with his followers, took refuge under the pillar of the Gauri Vidyaas.

**5.**  Then, Vasudeva asked Madanvega about the Vidyaadharas, and she described them as follows:

**6.**  "My Lord, those who are seated near our pillar, holding lotuses in their hands and wearing garlands of lotuses, are the Vidyaadharas known as Gaurikas."

**7.**  "Those who are wearing red garlands and red robes, and are seated near the Gandhaar pillar, are the Gandhaar Vidyaadharas."

**8.**  "Those who are wearing robes of various colors, as yellow as gold, and are seated near the Maanav pillar, are the Maanavputraka Vidyaadharas."

**9.**  "Those who are wearing somewhat red robes, adorned with shining jewels, and are seated near the Maanas pillar, are the Manuputraka Vidyaadharas."

**10.**  "Those who are holding various herbs in their hands, and are wearing various ornaments and garlands, and are seated near the Oushadhi pillar, are the Moolveerya Vidyaadharas."

**11.**  "Those who are wearing garlands of golden flowers and ornaments, and are seated near the pillar of the Earth, are the Antarbhoomichar Vidyaadharas."

**12.**  "My Lord, those who are wearing various earrings and are adorned with armlets, and are seated near the Shank pillar, are the Shankuka Vidyaadharas."

**13.**  "Those who are wearing turbans with ornaments and whose jeweled earrings are shining, and are seated near the Kaushik pillar, are the Kaushik Vidyaadharas."

##  Chapter 358 of the Harivamsha Purana

358
Harivamsha Purana
I have described the Aryas (noble ones) in brief. Now, O Lord, listen to me as I describe the lineages of the Matanga Vidyadharas. ||14||

Those who are dark like a cluster of blue clouds, adorned with blue garments and blue garlands, are the Matanga Vidyadharas, residing near the Matanga pillar. ||15||

Those who are covered in ash, adorned with ornaments made of bones from the cremation ground, are the Shmashan-nilaya Vidyadharas, residing near the Shmashan pillar. ||16||

Those who wear garments the color of blue sapphires and emeralds, and reside near the Pandura pillar, are the Panduka Vidyadharas. ||17||

Those who wear black deerskin, adorned with garments and garlands made of black leather, and reside near the Kala pillar, are the Kala-shvapaki Vidyadharas. ||18||

Those who have golden hair, adorned with ornaments of heated gold, and reside near the Shvapaki pillar, are the Shvapaki Vidyadharas. ||19||

Those who are covered in garments the color of green leaves, adorned with various crowns and garlands, and reside near the Parvata pillar, are known as the Parvateya Vidyadharas. ||20||

Those who are adorned with ornaments made of bamboo leaves, and wear garlands of flowers from all seasons, residing near the Vamsa pillar, are considered the Vamsalaya Vidyadharas. ||21||

Those who are adorned with ornaments bearing the marks of great serpents, and reside near the great pillar called Vrikshamoola, are the Varbha-moolika Vidyadharas. ||22||

These lineages of Vidyadharas, who travel in their own specific attire and adorn themselves with their own distinctive marks, have been described in brief. ||23||

Thus, having learned about the Vidyadharas from the instructions of his wife, Vasudeva returned to his own place, and the other Vidyadharas also departed to their respective places. ||24||

One day, for some reason, Kumar Vasudeva said to Madanavega, "Come, O swift one!" Angered by this, she went inside the house. ||25||

Then, Surpanakha, the widow of Vishkhira, disguised as Madanavega, using her magical powers, set fire to the palaces with her fiery form. ||26||

## Chapter Twenty-Six

359
While the seeker of liberation was in the sky, he saw the enemy, Manasvega, the Vidyadhara, suddenly appearing in the air. [27]
Releasing the seeker of liberation from the sky, she assigned Manasvega to kill him. As she wished, she went away, and he fell on a pile of grass. [28]
Hearing the glorious deeds of Jarasandha sung by the people, the seeker of liberation knew that this was the city of Rajgriha. He was pleased and entered the excellent city. [29]
In the city of Rajgriha, the seeker of liberation won a crore of gold coins in gambling and, being charitable, distributed them all to everyone, everywhere. [30]
The seers of omens had told Jarasandha that whoever would win a crore of gold coins in gambling and distribute them would be the father of his slayer. According to the orders of the seers of omens, they were searching for such a person at that time. [31]
Seeing him, the officials of Jarasandha captured Vasudeva and, with the intention of "let him die immediately," they bound him in a leather bag and threw him from the top of the mountain. [32]
As Vasudeva was falling down, suddenly, Vegavati came swiftly and caught him forcefully. As Vegavati was taking him somewhere, he thought to himself, "Look! Just as the Bharunda bird had carried away Charudatta before, it seems that I am also being carried away by the Bharunda bird. I don't know what kind of suffering awaits me now." [33-34]
These bonds of kinship are difficult and painful, material possessions are difficult, and a beautiful body is also difficult. Yet, foolish beings consider them to be their own and pleasurable. [35]
The soul alone performs virtuous and sinful actions, alone experiences pleasure and pain, alone is born and dies, yet it remains attached to its relatives. [36]
Those who are wise and courageous are happy and engaged in their own welfare, who have abandoned their attachment to material possessions and are established in the path of liberation. [37]
We are immersed in the waves of desire for material possessions, our actions are heavy, and we wander around, repeatedly experiencing the cycle of pleasure and pain in the world. [38]
Thinking thus, Vegavati brought Vasudeva down to the bank of the mountain.

English translation preserving Jain terms:

In the Harivamsha Purana:
Seeing her husband, Vegavati, distressed by separation, wept. Embracing her, he considered her as the delight of his senses. \\40\\ Then, questioned by him, the beloved narrated everything to him - what had happened to the husband, the happiness and sorrow in their abode. \\41\\ Searching for the two lineages, as in the forest and cities, she had wandered for a long time in the entire Bharata region. \\42\\ Desiring to see the husband of Madanavega, she even wished for her own separation, unnoticed in that place. \\43\\ Taking the form of Trisikha's wife, Surpanakha, she narrated the abduction and threw him up in the sky, intending to kill him. \\44\\ "You have fallen from there, brought by me. Here you are established at the Panchanada Tirtha and the Himanta mountain." \\45\\ Thus informing him of the events, he sported there on the resonant slopes of the Himanta mountain, with the moon-faced one. \\46\\ Wandering there by chance, he saw a woman bound by the serpent's noose, like a fortunate wild woman bound by the serpent's noose. \\47\\ With a compassionate heart, he freed that rising-faced one from the noose, like a Muni frees beings from the noose of sin. \\48\\ Freed from bondage, she bowed to him, the unexpected kinsman, and said, "By your grace, O lord, my vidya is accomplished." \\49\\ "Listen, in the southern lineage, in the city of Gaganavallabha, I am the princess Balacandra, born in the lineage of Vidyudamstra. \\50\\ Practicing the great vidya in the river, I was bound by the enemy of the vidya-bearers, the Nagagashas. But you, O lord, have liberated me." \\51\\ "In our lineage, previously another daughter, Ketumati, was also liberated like me by the one with the half-lotus wheel." \\52\\

- 361. Just as she became the sole wife of the half-chakra named Puṇḍarīka, so too, I am destined to be your wife. Be certain of this. ||53||
O Lord! Accept this Vidya, which is extremely rare for the Vidyadharas. ||54||
Upon hearing this, the young Vasudeva said, "This Vidya is worthy of being given to Vegavati, as per my desire." ||54||
Having received his command, she said, "So be it," and then gave the Vidya to Vegavati. Afterwards, she flew through the sky and went to the city of Gaganavallabha. ||55||
The young girl Balacandra, by giving the Vidya as a gift to Vegavati, quickly became free from the affliction. This is fitting, for Vidyadharis who practice the Jain Dharma quickly fulfill their desires. ||56||

Thus ends the twenty-sixth chapter of the Harivamsa Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which is a collection of the Arishṭanemi Purana and describes the vision of Balacandra. ||26||

## Chapter Twenty-Seven

In the meantime, King Shrenik, sitting at ease, asked Gautama Swami, "O Muni! Who was this Vidyuddanstra? And what was his conduct?" ||1||

Thus questioned, Gautama Swami replied, "In the lineage of Namik, in the city of Gaganavallabha, there was a Vidyadhara named Vidyuddanstra, who was the lord of both the श्रेणियाँ (Shreṇīs) and possessed extraordinary prowess." ||2||

"He brought from the Western Videha region a yogi named Sanjayanta and subjected him to severe उपसर्ग (upsarga)." ||3||

Curious, King Shrenik asked, "O Lord! Why did Vidyuddanstra inflict उपसर्ग (upsarga) on Sanjayanta Muni?" In response, the Ganadhara Bhagavan narrated the Papanashaka Purana of Sanjayanta Muni. ||4||

"O King! In the Western Videha region of this Jambudvipa, there is a country called Gandhamalini. In it lies the city of Vitashoka. In that city, once upon a time, a king named Vijayanta ruled." ||5||

"His wife was named Sarvasri, who seemed like Lakshmi herself, embodying prosperity. They had two excellent sons named Sanjayanta and Jayanta." ||6||

"Once, while they were wandering, the Self-Existent Tirthankara arrived there. Hearing the Dharma from him, the father and both sons, all three, took initiation." ||7||

"While they were wandering with their Acharya, Pihitastrava, Vijayanta Muni attained Kevalgyan, the destroyer of evil karmas." ||8||

"When the Devas of the four Nikayas were paying homage to Vijayanta Muni during the celebration of Kevalgyan, Jayanta Muni saw Dharanendra and realized his destiny to become Dharanendra. As a result, he died and became Dharanendra." ||9||

"Once, Sanjayanta Muni, the elder brother of Jayanta, was seated in the terrifying cremation ground of his beautiful city, Vitashoka, performing a seven-day प्रतिमा योग (pratima yoga)." ||10||

"At that time, Vidyuddanstra, having spent a long time in the Bhadrashala forest with his wives, was returning to his city when he accidentally saw Sanjayanta Muni." ||11||

"Fueled by past animosity, he became enraged and brought Sanjayanta Muni to the southern end of the Bharat region, to a mountain called Varuna." ||12||

The twenty-seventh chapter:

Hari-dvatī, Canda-vegā, Gaja-vatī, Kusuma-vatī, and Suvarna-vatī, these five rivers meet at a place. He left them there in the evening and in the morning he disturbed the Vidyadharas by saying, "Last night I saw a huge Rakshasa in my dream. He is going to destroy us. Therefore, O Vidyadharas! Let's kill him quickly."

Thus, he instigated the Vidyadharas and with them, he killed the Vidyadharas who were armed with various weapons. Muni-raja Sanjayanta also attained Nirvana in the peaceful Tirtha of Shitalanatha Bhagavan, having attained the knowledge of the last moment.

After that, Jayanta's Jiva-Dharanendra came to worship his body. He was very angry at the act of Vidyudamshta. He was about to kill Vidyudamshta by taking away all his knowledge, when at that time, Aditya-abha, the Sun God, came there and stopped him by saying, "O Dharanendra! O Phanindra! Do not kill living beings in vain."

You, I, this king of Vidyadharas, Vidyudamshta, and Sanjayanta, all of us have been wandering in the world, bound by hatred. Listen to what I say.

In this Bharat Kshetra, there is a country called Shakata. In its city of Singhapura, there was once a king named Singh-sena.

Singh-sena had a wife named Rama-datta, adorned with the ornaments of art and virtues, and a nurse named Nipuna-mati, who was very skilled even among the skilled.

The king had a Purohita named Shri-bhuta, who claimed to be truthful and was known in the world as being free from greed. His Brahmani's name was Shri-datta.

He built storehouses in all directions of the city and became very trustworthy to the merchant class.

At that time, there was a merchant named Sumitra-datta in the city of Padma-khanda. He had left his five jewels with the Purohita Shri-bhuta and had gone somewhere by ship due to his greed.

Page #402:
---------------------------
The merchant, Sumitradatta, whose heart was consumed by the desire for his lost jewels, climbed a tall tree near the royal palace and cried out every day, "Oh, King Singhsen, Queen Ramdatta, and all the righteous people, please have mercy on me! On such and such a day, in such and such a month, I entrusted these five jewels to the hands of the truthful Shribhuti, the purohit. But now, he is consumed by greed and refuses to return them." Every morning, he would cry out like this and then leave. 

After many months of this, one night, Priyaramdatta said to the king, "Oh, King! This is a great injustice. There are both strong and weak people in the world. Can the weak not survive in the hands of the strong?"

"This poor, weak man's jewels have been seized by the powerful purohit. Oh, Lord! If you have mercy, please help him get his jewels back."

The king replied, "My dear, this man's ship was wrecked at sea. He is distraught because he lost his wealth and is possessed by a demon. He is just rambling in his madness."

Hearing this, Ramdatta said, "Oh, King! He is not possessed by a demon of wealth, because he says the same thing every day. Please test him."

Hearing this, the king asked the purohit in private the next morning, but the traitor denied everything. It is only natural, for how can a greedy man be truthful?

The king then decided to test the purohit through a game of dice. Before the game, Queen Ramdatta had asked the purohit, "What did you eat last night?"

Following the queen's instructions, the clever maid went to the purohit's wife and asked for the jewels, mentioning the food he had eaten the previous night as a sign of recognition. But the purohit's wife refused to give them.

Then, the maid went to the purohit's wife again, this time with the sacred thread she had won in the game of dice, and asked for the jewels. But even then, she did not receive them, as the purohit had forbidden his wife from giving them away.

## Chapter Twenty-Seven:

**365**

Seeing the ring marked with the name of her husband, the priest gave them the jewels.  Following the queen's order, gambling was stopped.  **39**

Although the king had mixed the merchant's jewels with others, the merchant recognized his own jewels and was honored by the king for his honesty.  **40**

The priest, who delighted in stealing from others, had all his wealth taken away. He was fed cow dung and beaten to death by wrestlers.  **41**

Because he died with his mind clouded by greed, a snake named Agandhan was born in the king's treasury.  He was a traitor to the king and always wicked.  **42**

Another Brahmin named Dhammilla was appointed in the priest's place.  But he too was a hypocrite and often inclined to do things that were not right.  **43**

The merchant, Sumitradatta, went to his city, Padma-khandapur, with the jewels.  Although he understood the Jain Dharma, he desired to be the son of Queen Ramdatta.  With this desire, he became very charitable.  **44**

Sumitradatta's wife, who was always opposed to him, died and became a tigress on a mountain.  One day, Sumitradatta went to that mountain to pay homage to some Muni-rajas, and the tigress ate him.  He was the son of Ramdatta.  Although he could have become an Indra by his merit, he chose to be a prince instead.  He was named Singhchandra and was very dear to Ramdatta.  **46**

Singhchandra had a younger brother named Purnchandra, who was like Indra in his splendor.  These two brothers were famous in the world, like the sun and the moon.  **47**

Once, King Singhsen entered the treasury for some work, and the wicked snake Agandhan, who had a previous grudge against him, bit him.  **48**

In that city, there lived a Garuda-danda, who was skilled in the art of snake-charming.  He chanted mantras and called all the snakes, including Agandhan, and said to them, "The one among you who is the culprit should stay here, and the rest should go back to their places."  When Garuda-danda said this, the king...

Page #404:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, the concluding verse says, "O wicked one! Quickly withdraw the poison you have released. If you do not wish to withdraw it, then enter the fire!"  ||51||

Thus addressed, the venomous serpent, filled with anger, did not withdraw the poison, but entered the blazing fire and died, becoming a spotted deer. ||52||

Singhseno, the king, died and became an elephant in the Sallaki forest. The monkey, Dhammilla, who was placed in the place of Sribhuthi, also died and became a monkey in the same forest. What else can be the fate of those with false vision? ||53||

Ramadatta's sons, the king Singhchandra and the prince Purnachandra, both wise and powerful, ruled the earth from the sea to the sea. ||54||

King Purnachandra and Queen Hiranyavati, who resided in the city of Podana, were the parents of Queen Ramadatta. Both of them were imbued with the spirit of the Jain teachings. ||55||

Once, Ramadatta's father, Purnachandra, received initiation from the sage Rahubhadra and attained knowledge of the future. His mother, Hiranyavati, received initiation from the Aryika Dattavati and adopted the vows of an Aryika. ||56||

One day, Aryika Hiranyavati, Ramadatta's mother, heard from the sage Purnachandra, who had knowledge of the future, about Ramadatta's affairs and went to her and instructed her. ||57||

Hearing the instructions from her mother, Ramadatta became afraid of the world and took initiation at that very moment. Hiranyavati also instructed Ramadatta's son, Singhchandra, who also took initiation from the sage Rahubhadra. ||58||

After Singhchandra, Purnachandra, the prince who had subdued his enemies through his prowess, ascended the throne. However, he was attached to worldly pleasures and was devoid of right faith and vows. ||59||

Once, Aryika Ramadatta, bowing to the sage Singhchandra, who had knowledge of the future and was a holder of the fourfold knowledge, asked him about her past life, her mother's past life, and the past lives of her sons. ||60||

The sage replied, "In this very land of Bharata, in the country of Kosala, there was a village called Vardhaki. In that village, there lived a Brahmin named Mrigaayana." ||61||

The Brahmin's wife was named Madhura, who was sweet not only in name but also in nature. They had a daughter named Varuni, who was like intoxicating liquor to young men. ||62||

## Chapter Twenty-Seventh

After death, the king Atibala of Saketa, the son of Mrigayana, became Hiranyavati, the mother of Srimati.  [63]  You, Madhura, became Ramadatta, and your son, the son of Varuni, became Purnchandra.  I, the son of Sumitradatta, the merchant, became Singhchandra.  [64]  Your father, the elephant, was bitten by a snake in the previous life of Srimati.  I, as a Shravaka, helped him to take refuge in the Dharma of the elephant.  [65]  The snake, the charioteer of the evil one, became a deer, then a deer with a tail, and then, being eager for a tail, became a cruel rooster-snake, the one who takes possession of rough feathers.  [66]  The elephant, exhausted from fasting, was resting, his pride gone.  The rooster-snake bit him, and he, being virtuous, went to the Sahasrar heaven.  [67]  There, in the Sri-Prabha plane, he became a god named Sri-Dhara, the holder of Lakshmi, and now he enjoys with Apsaras, being delighted by Dharma.  [68]  The monkey, the previous life of Dhammilla, killed the rooster-snake, who had killed the elephant, in anger.  He, being sinful, went to the third hell, Balukaprabha.  [69]  A Mlechchha named Srigala-datta collected the elephant's teeth, bones, and pearls and gave them to the merchant Dhanamitra, who then presented them to King Purnchandra.  [70]  The king, being pleased with the teeth and bones, had a throne made from them and a necklace of pearls.  He sits on that throne and wears that necklace.  [71]  Oh, what a strange world this is, where the bodies of the beings are a source of enjoyment, just like the limbs of their fathers!  [72]  Hearing the words of the Muni, Ramadatta, being careless, went and explained everything to Purnchandra.  [73]  He, following the path of giving, worship, austerity, good conduct, and right faith, became a god in the Vaidyuryaprabha plane of the Sahasrar heaven.  [74]  Ramadatta, too, abandoning the female form through the power of right faith, became a god named Suryaprabha in the Prabhankara plane of the Sahasrar heaven.  [75]  Singhchandra Muni, having properly worshipped the four [1. Sight, 2. Lakshmi-Dhara, 3. This name, 4. Speech], became Indra in the Graiveyaka plane, known as Pritikara.  [76]

In the Harivamsha Purana, Surya Prabha, having fallen from Jambudvipa, was born as the son of Atibala, the king of Dharanitilaka, a city in the southern range of the Vaibharya mountains, to his queen, Mahadevi Shridhara, who was blessed with auspicious signs. ||7|| Shridhara was given to Sudarshan, the king of Alakapuri, and from him, Yashodhara was born, the mistress of the Vaidurya Prabha Vimana. ||79|| Yashodhara was given to Prabhakarapuri, the king of the northern range, Surya Avarta, and from him, Shridhara, the immortal, was born. ||80|| After giving his kingdom to his son Rashmivega, Surya Avarta went to Muni Chandra to practice austerities for liberation. ||81|| Shridhara and Yashodhara, both pure in their right faith, took initiation from a virtuous Aryika. ||82|| Rashmivega, desiring to pay homage, went to Siddhakoota, where he heard the Dharma from Harichandra Muni and became a Muni. ||83|| One day, Mahamuni Rashmivega was engaged in his studies in a cave called Kanchana, when the Aryikas Shridhara and Yashodhara came to pay their respects. ||84|| The soul of Shri Bhooti, the priest, who had been a Naraka in the Balukaprabha earth, was released after a long time and, after wandering in the world, became a serpent in the same cave. ||85|| Seeing the calamity, Muni Rashmivega entered the state of Kayotsarga, and both the Aryikas also took a cautious vow of renunciation. The serpent, with its large belly, swallowed all three. ||86|| Rashmivega died and became the great-minded Arka Prabha Deva in the Kapishta heaven, and both the Aryikas also became Devas in the Ruchak Vimana of the same heaven. ||87|| The great enemy, the serpent, died, his heart corrupted by the evil of fierce meditation, and was born in the fourth earth, Pankaprabha, stained with the mud of sin. ||88|| The soul of Singhchandra, the master of the Pritikar Vimana, fell from there and was born as Chakraayudha, the son of Aparajit, the king of Chakrapur, and his queen Sundari. Chakraayudha's wife was Chitramala, and from her, Vajrayudha was born, the son of Muni Rashmivega (the husband of Queen Ramadatta, the son of King Singh Sen). ||10||

The twenty-seventh chapter. The divine Shridhara, who was previously a Devaraja in Svarga, was born as the son of King Priyankara and Queen Ativega in the city of Prithvitilaka. Their daughter was named Ratnamala. ||11|| Ratnamala was given in marriage to Vajrayudha. The Jiva of Yashoda, who was previously a Devaraja in Svarga, was reborn as Ratnayu-dha, the son of Vajrayudha. ||12|| Chakrayudha, after entrusting the royal prosperity to his son Vajrayudha, engaged in severe penance at the feet of the Muni with pihitasrava, and finally attained Nirvana. ||23|| Vajrayudha also entrusted the kingdom to his son Ratnayu-dha and engaged in penance, but Ratnayu-dha became arrogant due to the intoxication of power and fell into wrong belief. ||24|| Once, the royal elephant of Ratnayu-dha, named Meghani-nada, went for bathing, but on seeing a Muni, he remembered his past life and did not drink water. ||25|| The king Ratnayu-dha did not understand the reason for this behavior of Meghani-nada, so he asked the Muni Vajradatta about it. ||16|| In the city of Chitrakara-pura, there was a king named Pritibhadra. His beloved wife was named Sundari, and they had a son named Pritikar. ||17|| Pritibhadra's minister was named Chitrabud-dhi, and his wife was Kamala. Their son was named Vichitramati. ||18|| The prince Pritikar and the minister's son Vichitramati, after hearing about the fruit of penance from Shrutasagara Muni, engaged in severe penance near his feet in their youth. ||19|| Those two, who were adorned with various types of penance and had a beautiful appearance, once went to the city of Saketa to see the Siddha-kshetras. ||20|| There, they saw a very beautiful courtesan named Buddhisena. Due to the fruition of his past karma, the minister's son Vichitramati fell from the state of a Muni and shamelessly abandoned the Muni-vrata. ||21|| Vichitramati, who had fallen from the Muni-vrata, became a cook in the service of King Gandhamitra. Being an expert in meat preparation, he pleased the king and obtained that courtesan as a reward. ||22|| That person, whose soul was constantly engaged in all kinds of sins, who had no shame in committing any sin, and who was fond of eating meat, went from this seventh earth.

In the Harivamsha Purana, the elephant, burdened by the cycle of birth and death, was born as a violent, intoxicated elephant due to his past sins. (104) He attained the memory of his past lives through the grace of the wise, and, realizing the futility of worldly desires, he became calm and renounced his actions. (105) Hearing the words of the sage, the elephant, Megha-ninad, and the king, Ratnayu, renounced their false identities and embraced the vows of a Shravaka. (106) The soul of the priest, Shri-bhuthi, who had been reborn as a serpent in the earth, Pankaprabha, was born as a son of the cruel Manghi and Darun, a couple of hunters. (107) In the forest of Priyangu-khanda, the sage Vajrayudha was meditating when he was killed by the hunter, Ati-darun. The sage attained the state of सर्वार्थसिद्धि, while the hunter was reborn in the seventh earth, Mahatamah-prabha, where he suffered greatly for killing the sage. (108-109) Ratna-mala, through the power of Shravaka dharma, became a celestial being in the Achyuta heaven, and Ratnayu also became a great deity in the same heaven. (110) In the island of Dhataki-khanda, in the land of Gandhila, located west of the eastern Meru, ruled the king, Arhad-das, in the city of Ayodhya. He had two queens, Suvrata and Jin-datta. The souls of Ratna-mala and Ratnayu, who had been celestial beings in the Achyuta heaven, were reborn as the valiant Vith-bhaya, the equivalent of Balabhadra, and the fearsome Vibhishan, the equivalent of Narayana, respectively, as the sons of these two queens. (111-112) Vibhishan, at the end of his life, was reborn in the first earth, Ratna-prabha, while Vith-bhaya, after performing austerities near the sage, Anivritti, became the Lant-avendra, Aditya-abha. I am that Lant-avendra. I went to the earth, Ratna-prabha, and enlightened the soul of Vibhishan, who was in hell. (113-114) In the land of Gandhamalini, in the Videha region of the Jambudvipa, there is a magnificent mountain, Vijayardha, adorned with beautiful dwellings of the Vidyadharas. On this mountain lived the king, Shri-dharma, and his queen, Shri-datta. The soul of Vibhishan, who was in hell, was reborn as a beautiful being on this mountain. (115)

## Chapter Twenty-Seventh

Having become the disciple of the Guru Anantamati, he became a celestial being in the Brahma-loka, the lord of the Chandra-abha Vimana. ||117||

The being, Sri-bhutika, who was previously a hunter, emerged from the seventh earth and became a serpent. Entering the Ratna-prabha, the first earth, he wandered among the animals, experiencing suffering. ||118||

He was born as a son to a tapasvi named Kha-mali, in the forest of Bhutaraman, on the banks of the river Airavati, to a woman named Kanaka-keshi. ||119||

He was like a deer, with deer antlers, and was performing the Pancha-agni tapas. By chance, he saw the celestial being Chandra-abha, who was flying in the sky. He recognized him as a Vidya-dhar, and as a result, he was born as the son of the Vidya-dhar, named Vidyut-damstra, from the womb of the queen Vidyut-prabha, whose efforts are illuminated by knowledge. ||120-121||

The being of Vajra-ayudha, having fallen from the state of Sarva-artha-siddhi, became Sanjayanta, and the being of Jayanta, having fallen from the Brahma-loka, became you, Dharanendra. ||122||

See the power of enmity! King Singha-sena had wronged the being of Sri-bhutika in one birth, but by harboring enmity, the being of Sri-bhutika killed Singha-sena in many births. ||123||

The being of Sri-bhutika, consumed by anger due to intense enmity, repeatedly plotted against Singha-sena, but what did he gain from it? On the contrary, his actions destroyed his own happiness. ||124||

The being of Singha-sena, while he was an elephant, attained Jain Dharma and became free from enmity. As a result, in his fifth birth, he attained liberation through the Sanjayanta Paryaya. But you, being a Naga-indra, are still clinging to enmity and wandering in the cycle of existence. ||125||

O Dharanendra! Knowing that enmity is the cause of the growth of this terrible cycle of existence, abandon it. And quickly abandon the root of all this, which is the false view. ||126||

Thus, being awakened by the words of Aditya-abha Deva, Dharanendra abandoned all enmity and embraced the right view, which leads to liberation from the cycle of existence. ||127||

Then, Dharanendra said to the Vidya-dharas, who were distressed like birds with broken wings, their efforts shattered due to the destruction of their knowledge: "O all Vidya-dharas! Quickly establish on this mountain the image of Sanjayanta, which is purifying, and build a temple with five arches, one hundred cubits high." ||128-129||

Page #410:
---------------------------
In the Harivansha Purana,
At the foot of the statue of Sanjayaanta Swami, those who perform rituals will attain knowledge only after great hardship, not otherwise. ||130||
From now on, in the lineage of the Viduddamshtra, only women will attain the knowledge of Prajnapti, Rohini and Gauri, not men. ||131||
Having accepted this command of Dharanendra, the celestial beings bowed and regained their knowledge as per their respective abilities. After this, the gods departed to their respective places. ||132||
Following the command of Dharanendra, the celestial beings established a statue of Sanjayaanta Swami on that mountain, adorned with various ornaments and made of gold and jewels. ||133||
Ashamed of losing their knowledge, the celestial beings sat on that mountain with their heads bowed. Therefore, people started calling that mountain Hrimanta. ||134||
In Mathura, there lived a king named Ratnavirya, the possessor of immense wealth. He had a wife named Meghamala, and their son, named Meru, was born from the womb of Adityaabha, the radiant one. ||135||
The same king Ratnavirya had another wife named Amitaprabha, and their son, named Mandara, was born from the womb of Dharanendra, as beautiful as the moon. ||136||
After becoming young, both of them enjoyed worldly pleasures as they desired. Later, both of them became disciples of the glorious Jinendra, Shreyansanath, and took initiation to become monks. ||137||
Among them, Meru, as steadfast as Mount Meru, attained the state of liberation by attaining the supreme knowledge, and Mandara, the one who resembled Mount Mandara, became the head of the congregation of Shreyansanath Bhagwan. ||138||
Gautama Swami says that those noble beings on this earth who desire to attain the state of a Tirthankara should respect this story of Sanjayaanta Swami, which is very famous in all three worlds, with utmost devotion and remember it well. ||139||
Thus ends the twenty-seventh chapter of the Harivansha Purana, composed by Jinaseenaacharya, which narrates the story of Sanjayaanta Purana, along with the collection of the Arishta-nemi Purana. ||27||
1. Those who desire to attain liberation.

Chapter Twenty-Eight

Hear, O Shrenik, the further deeds of the valiant Vasudeva, who was bereft of Vegavati and had attained the union of merit and valor. ||1||

Wandering through the forest without fatigue, the hero Vasudeva entered the hermitage of the ascetics and saw them engaged in idle talk. ||2||

"Why are you ascetics, who are united with austerity, engaged in tales of kings and battles? Austerity is the control of speech, etc." ||3||

Thus questioned, those ascetics, who were fond of distinguished visitors, replied, "We are newly initiated and do not know the ways of the munis." ||4||

"In Shravasti, there is a king named Eniputra, who is vast in fame, like the ocean, and possesses unyielding valor. ||5||

"His daughter, Priyangu Sundari, is a beauty unparalleled in the world. For her swayamvara, he invited all of us kings." ||6||

"But for some reason, she did not choose anyone, just as a wild elephantess does not choose any elephant other than a wild elephant." ||7||

"Then, those kings who were filled with desire for her, but were ashamed at not obtaining her, gathered together with the girl's father and prepared to fight immediately." ||8||

"Then, O sir, thousands of kings were quickly subdued by him, just as the sun subdues thousands of eyes. ||9||

"Some, filled with pride, were unable to bear defeat and, entering the battlefield, quickly gave up their lives." ||10||

"We, too, terrified by the neighing of his horses and his thousand-armed might, entered the dense forest, like groups of darkness." ||11||

"O sir, teach us the Dharma, for we do not know the essence of Dharma. You are the one who is worthy of being addressed." ||12||

Page #412:
---------------------------
374
In the Harivamsha Purana, it is said that Shourya explained the two types of Dharma to them. They, knowing the difference between Yati and Shravaka, attained the state of Shramanya accordingly. ||13||
Driven by the desire for the benefit of Priyangu Sundari, the son of Yadu entered the city of Shravasti, famous for its vast wealth. ||14||
There, in the outer garden, in front of the temple of Kamadeva, he saw a large, golden, three-legged buffalo. ||15||
Seeing it, he asked a Brahmin, "O great one! Why is this three-legged buffalo made of gems? There must be some reason for it." ||16||
The Brahmin said, "In this city, there was once a great king named Jitashatru, a descendant of Ikshvaku, who conquered his enemies. His son was named Mrigadhvaja. ||17||
In this city, there lived a wealthy merchant named Kamadatta. Once, he went to see his cattle, and a poor, small buffalo fell at his feet. ||18||
Seeing this miraculous event, the merchant asked the cowherd, Pindara, the reason for it. ||19||
The cowherd said, "From the day it was born, I felt great compassion for it. So, I went to the sage who resides in the forest, bowed to him, and asked him about it. ||20||
"O sage! Why do I feel such great compassion for this creature?" In response, the wise sage said, "O Gopal! Listen, I will tell you the reason. ||21||
"This poor creature was born from the same cow five times, and each time you killed it as soon as it was born. ||22||
"Now, it has been born for the sixth time from the same cow. This time, it remembers its past lives, and so, out of fear, it suddenly got up and fell at your feet. You were also responsible for protecting the young ones. ||23||
"Hearing the sage's words, I have raised it here like my own son. Now, it has fallen at your feet, desiring to live." ||24||
Hearing the cowherd's words, the merchant took the buffalo calf with him to the city and, obtaining protection from the royal officials, he increased its wealth. ||25||
They did not know the truth. Therefore, you should teach us Dharma. Your sweet words reveal that you have seen the truth of Dharma. ||12||
Thus, when they all asked, Vasudeva explained to them both types of Dharma, the difference between Shravaka and Muni, so that they, knowing the difference between Muni and Shravaka, attained the true state of Sadhu. ||13||

## Chapter Twenty-Eight

375. Due to the karmic bond of enmity from past lives, the prince, Mrigadhwaja, cut off the leg of the buffalo with a wheel. ||26||

When the king learned of this, he was enraged and ordered Mrigadhwaja to be killed. The minister, being wise, did not kill him but secretly took him to the forest and initiated him into the order of monks. ||27||

Bhadraka, due to auspicious circumstances, died on the eighteenth day, and on the twenty-second day, Mrigadhwaja, through pure meditation, became a Kevali (omniscient). ||28||

He was worshipped by the gods of the four Nikayas and humans. His father, Jitshatru, then asked him about the karmic connection between him and the buffalo. ||29||

Surrounded by gods, demons, and humans, whose hearts and ears were filled with joy at hearing his words, the Muni Mrigadhwaja spoke. ||30||

Once, in the city of Alka, there lived a king of the Vidyadharas named Ashvagriva, who was the enemy of the first Narayana, Tripishta. ||31||

His minister was Harishmashru, who had crossed the ocean of logic and was as difficult to touch as a lion's mane. ||32||

Harishmashru was an atheist, a staunch skeptic, and believed only in direct perception. He considered anything not directly perceived as non-existent. ||33||

He argued that just as the power of intoxication is not present in flour, but arises from the combination of various ingredients, similarly, the power of consciousness arises in this body from the combination of the four elements, which was not present before. ||34||

People's use of the term "soul" in relation to this consciousness is not contradictory, meaning there is no problem with people calling this consciousness the soul. In reality, there is no soul in the world separate from the elements, as it cannot be found. ||35||

The ignorant believe in a soul that is the doer of good and bad deeds, the experiencer of pleasure and pain, and the one who goes to the afterlife. But this is not true, as it cannot be seen. ||36||

The afterlife, with its divisions of hell, heaven, and the intermediate realms, is a mere figment of the imagination of the ignorant. There is no such thing as a soul that is the basis for the experience of these realms. ||37||

Page #414:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, it is stated that liberation (moksha) is attainable and certain only for those who possess special knowledge (jnana-vritti).  It is not logical or supported by evidence to believe in liberation when the liberated soul (moktri) does not exist. (38) For a being (jiva) who is born from the combination of elements (bhuta-samslesha) and destroyed by their separation (bhuta-vislesha), and who enjoys pleasures (sukha), restraint (samyama) is the destruction of those pleasures. (39) The minister, who was captivated by such one-sided arguments (ekanta-kutarka), was always averse to the knowledge of the soul and other things (jiva-adyartha) as revealed by scriptures (agama) and inference (anumana). His mind was deluded by tales of the afterlife (paraloka-katha) and he was obsessed with sensual pleasures (kama-bhoga), becoming a low-minded (kanishtha) and a defamer of dharma. (40-41)  The minister Harishmashru, who was an atheist (nastika), denied the existence of the afterlife (pretyabhava-apalaapi), criticized the Tirthankaras and Chakravartis (mahapurusha), and was full of deceit (khotti-cheshta), influenced Ashvagriva to become an atheist as well. As a result, Ashvagriva also turned away from dharma and was constantly tormented by ghosts (pishacha) and other beings, as if possessed by them. (42-43)  Later, in a battle, Ashvagriva was killed by Tripishta Narayana, and Harishmashru was killed by Vijay Balabhadra. Both of them went to the seventh hell, called Tamas-tama. (44) O King! After wandering through many births for a long time, Ashvagriva's soul has become me, Mrigadhwaja, and Harishmashru's soul is now a buffalo named Bhadraka. (45) Due to the influence of past anger (purva-kopa-anubandha), I killed that buffalo, and he became a demon named Lohita due to the influence of the absence of desire (akama-nirjara). (46)  Lohitasura has come here with devotion to sandalwood (chandana-bhakti) and is endowed with divine power (deva-bhuta). He is sitting here, treated as a friend. (47) O King! This influence of anger (krodha-anubandha) is capable of blinding beings (sattva-andhikarana-kshama). Those who desire liberation (shiva-kankshi) should control it and become peaceful. (48)  Hearing this account from the mouth of the Kevali Mrigadhwaja, many kings, including Jitashatru, took initiation. The demon Mahishasura became peaceful, and the people of the assembly, abandoning greed (laulya), became free from malice (nishalya) and adorned (sushobhit). (49)  Then, after paying homage to the gods, demons, and the Kevali, they went to their respective places, and the Kevali Mrigadhwaja went to the abode of the Siddhas (siddha-sthana). (50)

Kamdatt, the Seth, established a statue of the Kevali, Mrigadhwaj, and a statue of a buffalo in the city, at a place where people frequented, in front of the Jain temple. ||1|| The Seth also had statues of Kamadeva and Rati made in the same temple for the amusement of all the people. ||2|| Attracted by the sight of Kamadeva and Rati, people from all over the world came to the Jain temple and, seeing the two statues, listened to the story of the Kevali, Mrigadhwaj, and the buffalo. As a result, many men embraced the Jain religion every day. ||3-4|| This Jain temple, known as the temple of Kamadeva, became famous and was the cause of many people coming to it out of curiosity and attaining the Jain religion. ||5|| After many generations had passed in the lineage of Seth Kamdatt, a Seth named Kamadeva was born. ||6|| He had a daughter named Bandhumati, who was beautiful and full of youth, with a face like the full moon, and who brought joy to her family. ||7|| When her father asked the astrologer, he said that the man who would open the door of Kamadeva's temple and worship him would be her husband. ||8|| Hearing these words, Vasudeva went to the door of Kamadeva's temple and, with great effort, opened the door, which was guarded by thirty-two locks, and entered. ||9|| After entering, Vasudeva first worshipped the statues of the Jina and then worshipped Kamadeva and Rati. At that time, Seth Kamadeva was also in the temple to worship the statues, and he saw Vasudeva. ||10|| Then, with a happy heart, Seth Kamadeva, following the instructions of the astrologer, gave his beautiful daughter, Bandhumati, to Vasudeva. ||11|| News spread throughout the city that Seth Kamadeva, who was eager for a son-in-law, had given his daughter to Vasudeva, a man who fulfilled desires and was as wonderful as Kamadeva himself. ||12|| This news reached the king's inner palace, and Vasudeva was seen by the king's people. ||13||

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The Thirty-ninth Chapter
Priyasundari, having somehow caught sight of him, became enamored of him. Though she was attached to him, she became detached like water [i.e., lost her appetite] (14). Calling her confidante Bandhumati aside, she asked her, "You are the beloved of my husband. What is his skill and expertise?" (15) Bandhumati, in her innocence, described to her the clever behavior of that innocent one [i.e., Vasudeva], how she had fallen into infatuation with him, experiencing great happiness (16). Priyasundari, putting aside her pride, went to the doorkeeper and said, "Either let him come to me or I will kill myself" (17). The Yadavas, considering this improper and unethical, skillfully devised a pretext to pass the time (18). The girl, Shouri's daughter, in whom he had placed his trust, thinking her desire would be fulfilled that night on the bed, (19) embraced the sleeping Bandhumati and the Vrishni hero [i.e., Vasudeva], and a divine Nagakanya [serpent maiden] awakened them in the night (20). Awakened, he saw the woman with the serpent mark all over her body, and wondered, "Who is this woman here?" (21) And being called by the skilled in amorous conversation, he was led by the modest one to the Ashoka grove, where she said, "Listen, O steadfast one! I shall tell you the reason for my coming, by which your ears will be satisfied as if with nectar" (22-23). There was a king named Amoghdarshana, of unimpeded prowess, who had conquered the circle of his enemies, in the Chandana forest (24). His beloved was Charumati, and their son, endowed with political wisdom and heroism, was the beautiful Charuchandra, adorned with fresh youth (25). And in that city was a courtesan named Rangasena, endowed with the qualities of the arts, the daughter of Kamapatakas, as it were the flag of Kama [the god of love] (26).

In the Harivamsha Purana, the king, deluded by dharma, entered the sacrificial initiation. The ascetics with matted hair, such as Kaushika, also arrived there. \\27\\ By the king's order, the woman with the flag of Kama danced. Clearly taking away the hearts of men with that flag of Kama. \\28\\ Endowed with scriptural skill, subsisting on the roots, leaves and fruits, Kaushika was agitated there, then what to speak of others? \\29\\ After the sacrificial rite was over, the king's son accepted that maiden. The ascetics came again, seeking the maiden. \\30\\ When they requested her from Kaushika, the king said, "The maiden has been taken by the prince, you may go." \\31\\ "The serpent is also to be killed by me, O king," said Kaushika, distressed in his inner self, and went away. \\32\\ The king anointed his son as the protector of the earth. He became a tapasvin along with the unexpressed-wombed queen. \\33\\ The tapasvin also obtained a daughter, adorned with the ashrama, known as Rishidatta, even by her name. \\34\\ She obtained the vows of the Charanas near the hermitage. And the youthful beauty, captivating the minds and eyes of the young men. \\35\\ The illustrious son of Shantayudha, known as Shilayudha, the lord of Shravasti, once went to the hermitage of the ascetics. \\36\\ Entertained by that tapasvin maiden with delightful food, with the beauty of her breasts adorned with bark garments. \\37\\ Excessive trust developed between those two, who were incomparable. They transgressed the propriety long maintained. \\38\\ The fearless youth went to a secluded place with her, fearlessly enjoyed her as he wished, under the control of the noose of Kama. \\39\\

## Chapter Thirty-Eight

381. Then that virtuous lady, filled with virtue, declared, "O noble son of Arya, I am a woman of the season, capable of bearing a child." 40. Then, with a troubled mind, she asked, "What should I do now?" Asked thus, he said to her, "My dear, do not be troubled. Listen! I am Sheelayudh, the king of Shravasti, born in the Ikshvaku lineage, a destroyer of enemies. You must come to see me, along with your son, in Shravasti." 41-42. Thus assuring her, he embraced her in secret, enduring the pain of separation. Meanwhile, his army reached the hermitage of the ascetics. 43. Seeing his army, he was pleased and entered the city with them. After the king left, the lady, knowing the ways of the world, confessed the truth to her parents, saying, "I have become the secret wife of the shameless king Sheelayudh and am pregnant." 44-45. Then, after nine months, she gave birth to a beautiful son, resembling his father, as if he were manifested by him. Due to the pain of childbirth, she died soon after giving birth. And, due to the influence of Samyak Darshan, a Naga princess named Jwalanprabhavallabha was born. That is me. I have also attained the knowledge of the cycle of births and deaths due to divine grace. 46-47. Therefore, knowing all about my previous life, I went to the hermitage of my father and son, moved by compassion and affection. There, I comforted my grief-stricken parents and raised my son, who was in the form of a deer, by feeding him milk. Later, the sage Kaushiki, who had become a serpent due to the karma of her past life, bit my father out of old enmity. But I saved his life with an infallible mantra. Although my father was consumed by anger that could not be quelled, I taught him Dharma and made him embrace it, leading him to a higher realm after his death. Then, wearing the garb of an ascetic and carrying my son, I went to King Sheelayudh. 48-51. Seeing the king with great splendor, I said to him, "O King, your son is endowed with the qualities of a king..." 52.

In the Harivamsha Purana:

The king accepted the child abandoned by the queen, named Enipuṭra. When the king asked how the child came to him, the sage narrated the entire story. The sage revealed that she had become a goddess after her death, and out of affection for the growing child, the king, Shilayudha, accepted him as his own son. 

Later, the king initiated Enipuṭra as the ruler and himself took sannyāsa and attained the heavenly abode. Thereafter, Enipuṭra's daughter, named Priyaṃgusundarī, was born, who was of dark complexion like the Priyaṃgu flower and extremely beautiful. When she came of age, she held a svayaṃvara ceremony, but being disinclined towards sensual pleasures, she rejected all the royal suitors.

One day, when Priyaṃgusundarī saw the sage (the narrator) and the king's companion Bandhūmatī in the royal palace, she was pierced by the arrows of Cupid. The sage then asked the king to unite with her, assuring him that she was not given to anyone else. The sage claimed to be the authority in the matters of this royal lineage, and said that she had been given to the king by her own father and brothers. The sage fixed an auspicious night for their union in the temple of the god of love. When the king humbly requested the boon that whenever he remembers the goddess, she should grace him, the goddess agreed.

Then, on the full moon day of Kartik, Kumar Vasudeva, who had been playing for a long time and was very tired, was sleeping soundly, embraced by Priyangu Sundari. He woke up suddenly for some reason. As he woke up, he saw a very beautiful girl, like a second Lakshmi, standing in front of him. 

The Kumar asked her, "O lotus-eyed one! Who are you?" In reply, the girl said, "O Kumar! You will know all about me soon. Come with me now." Thus, calling the Kumar, the girl went outside. 

The Kumar, leaving the embrace of his beloved, followed her. Going outside, she sat on the floor of the beautiful palace and said, explaining the reason for her coming:

"O Arya Putra! O Sriman! Steady your mind and listen to my words, which are the cause of obtaining the unattainable."

"In the Gandhar country, in the southern range of this Vijayardha mountain, there is a city called Gandhasamriddha. Its king is Gandhar. His wife is Prithvi, who is as dear to him as the earth itself. I am their daughter, Pramavati, who is as radiant as Lakshmi herself."

"One day, I went to the excellent city of Swarna Nabha, driven by a mental urge. There, I met Angaravati, the mother of Manasavega, and asked her about her daughter, Vegavati."

"Vegavati's friends told me about her and also said that just as the star Chitra is in conjunction with the moon, so is she with you."

"In that same city, there lives Somashri, whose pure character is her ornament and whose food is to take your name. She is your beloved, whose necklace hangs on her cheeks, which have turned pale due to the great sorrow of your separation."

"She has sent me to you with a message. She said, 'O Arya Putra! Although I am protected within the impregnable fortress of my character, which cannot be breached by flattery or persuasion, I am still here in this enemy's territory for a long time."

Chapter Thirty
385
The enemy's mother, who is always threatening her son, is protecting me, and that is why I am still alive. O Lord of Life, please free me from this enemy quickly. ||13||
If I continue to endure this separation, I may die here. Therefore, O hero, do not neglect me, even though you have a hard heart. ||14||
I have delivered the message sent by Somashri, whose eyes are always filled with tears. Now, whatever needs to be done is up to you, as you are her husband. ||15||
Do not think that the place of the mountain is inaccessible to me, because I will take you there in the blink of an eye, if you wish. ||16||
Having heard the words that were worthy of being heard, along with many identifying signs, the wise Vasudeva said to her, "O gentle-faced one, take me to Somashri's house quickly." ||17||
Having received permission from the Kumar, Prabhavati, who was endowed with the power of knowledge, took him and flew through the sky like a flash of lightning. ||18||
They both, whose bodies were filled with thrills from touching each other, crossed the sky and quickly reached the excellent city called Swarnabhapur. ||19||
Then, Prabhavati, whose waist-band and clothes had slipped down a little, secretly took Vasudeva to Somashri's house. Upon arriving, the Kumar saw Somashri. ||20||
At that time, Somashri was in a bad state due to separation. Her beauty, with her face pale from separation and her hair hanging down all around, was tarnished. Therefore, she seemed like a lotus flower, stained with pollen from the bees that were hovering nearby. ||21||
She was adorned with a braid that was tied until her husband's arrival, so she seemed like a river with a thin bridge. Her lower lip was devoid of the redness of betel nut, and was somewhat dull, so she seemed like a withered vine bearing some wilted leaves. ||22-23||
Seeing her husband arrive, she stood up, and with her large and pale breasts, she seemed like the autumn season, bearing large and white clouds. Seeing Somashri, the Kumar Vasudeva was very pleased. ||24||
Their bodies were rough with thrills,

Harivamsha Purana
Having achieved the desired result, she embraced the beloved, who was like her own life, and greeted her with sweet words. ||26||
Assuming the form and name of Prabhavati, she left the couple, having obtained their permission, and returned to her own abode. ||27||
Thus, having assumed the transformed form, the young Vasudeva resided with Somaśrī in the abode of Manasvega for some time. ||28||
One day, Somaśrī awoke first and, seeing her husband Vasudeva in his natural form, began to weep, fearing some calamity from the enemy. ||29||
The young man awoke and, seeing her weeping, asked, "My dear, why are you weeping?" She replied, "I do not see your transformed form, and that is why I am weeping." ||30||
He said, "Do not fear, for this is the nature of knowledge: it leaves the body of a sleeping person and returns when he wakes up." ||31||
Having said this, he assumed his former form, and Vasudeva, along with his beloved Somaśrī, remained there. ||32||
Then, one day, Manasvega somehow saw Vasudeva, and, complaining that "Vasudeva is living with my wife Somaśrī in a transformed form," he went to King Balasiṃha of Vaijayanti with his wife. ||33||
King Balasiṃha was a just man, and when he investigated the complaint, Manasvega was defeated. Defeated, Manasvega was greatly ashamed and rose to fight Vasudeva. ||34||
Seeing this, many Vidyadharas stood in support of Vasudeva. Then, a battle ensued between Vasudeva and Manasvega. ||35||
The mother of Vegavati gave her son-in-law Vasudeva a divine bow and two quivers filled with divine arrows, and Prabhavati, having learned of the battle, quickly gave him the knowledge called Prajñapti. By its power, the young man quickly bound Manasvega in battle. ||36-37||
Then, 1. -suparāvṛtti rūpaṃ m., g. | 2. -dūpalakṣitam g. | 3. patyā g, | 4. vedāt m. | 5. yuddhe.

## Chapter Thirty

### 387

Driven by his mental energy, Manasvega, filled with brotherly affection, reached the great city of Mahapur with Somaśrī in his chariot.  

### 39

Upon reaching there, Vasudeva met Somaśrī's relatives.  Manasvega, though driven by mental energy, remained at his post, obedient to their commands.

### 40

The time passed pleasantly for the two, their minds filled with the nectar of love, as they engaged in questions and answers about their experiences and stories.

### 41

One day, Surpak, the son of the king Trishikhar, who was an enemy of the Kumar, took the form of a horse and abducted the Kumar, throwing him from the sky into the Ganges.

### 42

Crossing the Ganges, the Kumar Vasudeva reached the hermitage of the ascetics. There, he saw a woman, mad and adorned with a garland of human bones, and asked an ascetic, "Whose wife is this beautiful woman, who wanders about like a mad elephant, under the influence of madness?"

### 43-44

The ascetic replied, "She is Ketumati, the daughter of King Jarasandha, and was married to King Jitashatru.

### 45

A wandering magician had subdued her, but he died, and she now wanders the earth, wearing a garland of his bones."

### 46

Hearing this, Vasudeva, filled with compassion and the power of great mantras, quickly subdued the demon who possessed Ketumati.

### 47

Jarasandha's men had already been sent to search for Vasudeva, and despite his kindness, they captured him and took him to the royal city.

### 48

Vasudeva asked his captors, "O royal men, tell me, what crime have I committed against the king, that I am being taken away in this angry manner?"

### 49

The royal men replied, "He who removes the demon from the princess will be the father of the king's enemy."

### 50

Thus, surrounded by vile men, Vasudeva was taken to the place of execution. But before he could be killed, a Vidyadhara snatched him up and carried him away into the sky.

### 51

The Vidyadhara said, "O hero, know that I am your grandfather, Magoratha by name, and I fulfill the desires of my mind."

### 52

Manasvega, the Kumar's mother, filled with compassion, took the Kumar to Somaśrī and left him there.

## Chapter 30: The Description of the Benefits of Prabhavati

388
"O valiant one! Know me as Prabhavati's grandfather, Bhageerath by name, and I will fulfill your desires." Thus speaking, the Vidhyadhara, with sweet words, took him towards Prabhavati. ||53||

Reaching the city of Gandhasamridh, situated on the peak of the mountain, Vasudeva, surrounded by many Vidhyadharas, entered the city with great splendor. ||54||

Then, on an auspicious day and constellation, the wedding of Vasudeva and Prabhavati was celebrated with joy by her father and relatives. ||55||

Vasudeva and Prabhavati were already captivated by each other's love before the ceremony. Now, as husband and wife, they were immersed in the ocean of worldly pleasures. ||56||

Gautama Swami says: Even though wicked people, due to their evil deeds, always separate others from their loved ones, those who have embraced the Jain Dharma in their previous lives, are blessed with the company of their loved ones, even more than a hundred times in their present life. ||57||

Thus ends the thirtieth chapter of the Harivansha Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which is a part of the Arishta-nemi Purana, and describes the benefits of Prabhavati. ||30||

1. Yoga: Here it means "being connected".

1. Then, after some time, the prince Vasudeva was sleeping in the palace with Prabhavati, when suddenly his enemy Surpaka snatched him and took him to the sky. After some time, when Vasudeva woke up, he started beating his enemy with his fists. Frightened by the blows, Surpaka dropped Vasudeva, who then fell into the pond of the Godavari.

2. From there, he reached the town of Kundapura, where the king Padmaratha had a skillful and beautiful daughter. Vasudeva won her hand in marriage by demonstrating his skill in garland-making.

3. Later, Vasudeva was again abducted by his enemy Nilakantha and dropped from the sky, but he fell into the lake of Champa city. From there, he entered the city and married the daughter of the minister.

4. One day, while Vasudeva was enjoying water sports in Champa, he was again seized by his enemy Surpaka. This time, Vasudeva escaped and fell into the Ganga river, harboring many desires.

5. Wandering in the forest, Vasudeva was spotted by the king of the Mlecchas, who got him married to his daughter named Jara.

6. Vasudeva, with his elevated valor, begot a son named Jaratkumara from Jara. He also obtained the excellent daughters Avantisundari and Shurasena.

7. Another daughter named Jivadyasha, who was searching for a husband, and many other daughters, Vasudeva married and then came to the city of Arishthapura.

8. At that time, the brave, heroic and battle-resisting king Rudhira ruled there. His queen, named Mahadevi, was radiant like a goddess.

9. The eldest son of the king, named Hiranyanaabha, was skilled in warfare and scriptures, a great warrior and a learned person.

10. The daughter named Rohini was endowed with the qualities of beauty, youth and fame, just like the goddess Rohini.

## English Translation:

**390**
**Harivamsha Purana**

All the kings, including Jarasandha and Samudravijaya, were assembled for the swayamvara. [12] The kings, adorned with ornaments, were seated on the platforms decorated with various kinds of gem-studded pillars. [13] Vasudeva, disguised in a way that his brothers could not recognize him, was also present there. He was seated among the musicians playing the Panava, and he was the leader of them. [14]

Then, the daughter of Rohini, who was as beautiful as the Rohini star, entered the swayamvara, which was a land of good fortune. [15] At that time, all the kings, with their eyes filled with longing, looked at her, as if they were worshipping her with lotus-like eyes. [16] Those kings who had been filled with joy upon hearing about her beauty, now felt that joy even more intensely upon seeing her. [17] Just as a fire, fueled by the cotton of hearing, slowly burns, but when it receives the fuel of seeing, it burns brightly, so too, the love of those kings, which had been kindled by hearing, now burned brightly upon seeing her. [18]

After the sound of the conch shells and trumpets subsided, the virtuous nurse, holding the adorned girl, addressed the kings. [19] "My daughter, this king Jarasandha, whose white umbrella, like the moon, is adorned with the wealth of victory over three kingdoms, and whose commands are obeyed by all beings on earth and in the heavens, is the lord of the earth. [20-21] Oh Rohini, accept this king Jarasandha, who has come to earth like the moon, leaving behind the Rohini constellation, out of his desire to obtain you." [22]

Seeing that Rohini was not attracted to Jarasandha, the virtuous nurse, who knew her heart, said, "These are the sons of Jarasandha. Choose whichever one you like." [23] When she saw that Rohini was not attracted to any of them, the nurse, who knew her heart, said, "Look, my daughter, at Ugrasena, the king of Mathura. If he pleases you, choose him." [24]

**Notes:**

* **Swayamvara:** A self-choice marriage ceremony where a woman chooses her husband from among a group of suitors.
* **Jarasandha:** A powerful king who was a sworn enemy of Krishna.
* **Samudravijaya:** A king who was a friend of Jarasandha.
* **Panava:** A type of musical instrument.
* **Rohini:** A star constellation and also the name of the princess.
* **Ugrasena:** The father of Krishna and the king of Mathura.

Thirty-first Chapter

391. "Look, daughter, at the kings of Suryapur, who possess wisdom, courage, and other virtues. If you like, place a garland around the neck of one of them." 

25. Having said this, the girl's mind was filled with reverence for the gurus. Then, she showed her the Pandava king, and after him, Vidura.

26. She showed her Damaghosha, the one who proclaimed fame, Dattavaktara, the one with great valor, Shalya, who was like a thorn to his enemies, Shatrujaya, the one with a meaningful name, Chandraabha, the one as beautiful as the moon, Kalamukha, the chief, Paundra, the one with lotus-like eyes, Matsya, the one devoid of envy,

27. Sanjay, the one engrossed in victory, Somadutta, the best among kings, his son, Bhurisrava, obedient to his brothers,

28. Anshumat, the one with the son Anshumat, Kapila, the one with vast qualities, Padmaratha, the king, Somaka, the one as gentle as the moon,

29. Devaka, the one with the appearance of Devnatha, Shrideva, the one served by his Lakshmi-like wife. Having shown her all these kings, she explained their lineage and position.

30. Then, the nurse, who knew justice, showed the girl other kings as well. "Daughter, these are the main ones. Why are you standing silently? Place a garland around the neck of the one who resides in your heart, the one you desire. All these kings are attracted to your auspicious qualities and are standing here near you. Reveal the good fortune of the one who has captured your heart. Your parents are sleepless with worry about finding a suitable husband for you. Accept a worthy groom and make them happy."

31-34. The girl replied to the nurse, "Mother, you have spoken well. But my heart is not drawn to any of the kings you have shown me."

35. After seeing someone, if love arises in the heart, then words are repeated, and there is satisfaction in both the man and the woman when their inner love is revealed.

36. "Daughter, look, the king Ugrasena, the lord of Mathura, is sitting there. If you like, look at him."

Harivamsha Purana
Neither anger nor hatred, nor attachment nor emptiness. Like a sage, I have become indifferent to all of them.  ||37||
If the Creator has destined someone else for me, who is superior to all these, then let the Creator, the Guru of the world, show me that groom. ||38||
After saying this, the princess heard the sweet sound of the Panava, which was captivating and drew her heart towards it. ||39||
That sound seemed to clearly say, "Oh beautiful one! The Rajahansa who will captivate your heart is sitting here, so look this way." ||40||
Then, as the princess turned to look, she saw Vasudeva, who was like Kubera, adorned with royal qualities. ||41||
At that moment, Kamadeva, with his sharp arrows of mutual glances, shattered the hearts of both of them. ||42||
Then, Rohini, who was adorned with ornaments and seemed to be bending down under the weight of her breasts, approached Vasudeva and placed a garland around his neck. ||43||
Sitting near Vasudeva, who was seated on the platform, Rohini appeared as beautiful as the Rohini star near the moon. ||44||
Trembling slightly due to the fear arising from this new union, Rohini brought pleasure to Vasudeva's body with the touch of her own. ||45||
Seeing this Swayamvara, some kings said, "Oh! Just as gems and gold are a perfect match, so too is this union of the worthy groom and bride." ||46||
"Oh! Look at the cleverness of this princess, who has chosen this incomparable king, who is from a hidden lineage, wealthy, and a great man." ||47||
Other kings, consumed by envy, said, "Look, the princess has done a great injustice by choosing the Panava player as her groom." ||48||
"It is not right for the kings to ignore this defeat, because if this happens, there will always be chaos on earth, and all the rules of lineage will be broken." ||49||
"What influence does this non-noble man have in this assembly of noble people? Or, if he is noble and wants to reveal his lineage, let him do so." ||50||
"If he doesn't do this, then he must be of a low lineage, and this princess must also be from some low family, even though she is the daughter of a king." ||51||

## Chapter Thirty-Nine

Vasudeva, the valiant, then spoke to the enraged kings, "Hear my words, O Kshatriyas, both righteous and wicked.  A maiden in a Swayamvara chooses her husband according to her liking, be he noble or ignoble. There is no order in a Swayamvara.  Therefore, it is not fitting for the father, brother, or any other knowledgeable person to be agitated in this matter.  One born in a noble family may be unfortunate for a woman, while another born in a low family may be fortunate. There is no restriction in this matter of lineage and good fortune.  Therefore, if this maiden has revealed my unknown good fortune, you should not say anything about it.  And if anyone here is not pacified by this display of valor, I will pacify him with arrows drawn to the ear. "

Hearing these words, Jarasandha, the king, became enraged and said to the other kings, "Seize this arrogant man and the king Rudhira, along with his son."  The wicked kings, already enraged, were further incensed by the Chakravarti's order.  They were ready for battle.  Some of the righteous kings, the best of the Kshatriyas, stood apart with their armies, desiring to stop the evil.  Those who were on Rudhira's side, their eyes red with anger, were ready to attack the enemy.  Rudhira's son, Swarnabha, mounted his chariot, Rohini, and stood ready.  Rudhira, with his entire army, stood ready, having placed the noble Vasudeva on his chariot.  Rudhira addressed his warriors with sweet words, "O great warriors! Do what is fitting in battle, as your names suggest."  Vasudeva said to his father-in-law, Rudhira, "O revered one! Please give me a chariot quickly, one filled with many weapons and arrows."

Page #432:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, "I will do something wonderful to these Kshatriyas. Let them endure my arrows, whose lineage is unknown in number." (65) Having said this, Rudhira was pleased by the insight into the minds of men. He summoned a great chariot, strong in its construction, with swift horses. (66) At that time, a Vidyaadhara named Dadhimukha, a hero, valiant, standing on a chariot, shining with divine weapons, appeared like a wish fulfilled. (67) He bowed and said to him, "Ascend my chariot quickly. I will be your charioteer in battle. Destroy the enemy's ranks as you wish." (68) Pleased by his words, Shouri ascended the chariot, adorned with a bow, armor, and a multitude of arrows. (69) The army of Rudhira, consisting of two thousand chariots, six thousand maddened elephants, fourteen thousand horses, and one hundred thousand foot soldiers, approached quickly, determined to destroy the enemy army. (70-71) With that powerful, four-armed army, whose end was not visible, Shouri went towards the sea of the enemy's army. (72) Then, a clash occurred between the two four-armed armies, with the roar of the sea, the sound of conch shells, and other terrifying sounds. (73) Elephants, horses, chariots, and foot soldiers, in accordance with their respective strengths, fought against elephants, horses, chariots, and foot soldiers in the battlefield. (74) With a dense network of arrows covering the sky, even the sun was not visible in the battle, let alone other things. (75) In that battlefield, where the blood flowing from the blows of swords, discs, and maces created darkness, even the movement of the sun's rays was stopped. The movement of even the most valiant men was hindered. (76) There, great elephants were falling like mountains, and men, horses, and chariots were collapsing, worn out. A great sound arose from all this. (77)

---------------------------
## Chapter Thirty-Nine

395. Then, Vasudeva and Hiranyanama, eager to support their own army, which had been exhausted after a long battle, moved to the front. ||7|| They were unseen, their movements concealed by the art of wielding their eyes and fists. They began to cover the enemy ranks with arrows. ||79|| In that great battle, there was no elephant, no chariot, no horse, nor man who was not shattered by the two of them, who unleashed their sharp arrows. ||80|| Kumar Vasudeva scattered the rain of arrows launched by the enemy with his Vayavya weapon, and with his Maheindra arrow, he broke the bows of the enemy. ||81|| With his arrows, he brought down the enemy's moon-bright umbrellas, their shining glory, and their lofty, honored hair. ||82|| While the valiant Vasudeva was engaged in this fierce battle, the valiant Hiranyanama confronted the Paundra king on the battlefield. ||83|| Like two lion cubs engaged in a fierce battle, these two great charioteers, Kumaras, fought fiercely with their arrows. ||84|| Hiranyanama, with his sharp arrows, quickly brought down the enemy's flag, umbrella, charioteer, and horses. ||85|| Then, the enraged Paundra king, with his arrows like thunderbolt staffs, retaliated, mimicking the actions of his enemy, bringing down his flag, umbrella, charioteer, and horses. ||86|| Then, Hiranyanama also pierced the enemy's armor, flag, umbrella, chariot, charioteer, and horses with a shower of arrows. ||87|| Having rendered Paundra chariotless, Vasudeva, with his sharp arrows, quickly aimed a life-taking arrow at him, just as he was about to mount his chariot. ||88|| Vasudeva, with his crescent-shaped arrow, cut down Paundra's bow, and quickly brought Hiranyanama onto his own stable chariot. ||89|| As Vasudeva, showering arrows, covered Paundra, many enemies, united, rained a shower of arrows upon him. ||90|| But Vasudeva, with his arrows, repelled the enemy's arrows. ||91||

Page #434:
---------------------------
396
In the Harivamsha Purana, the righteous kings, the experts in justice, said, "This battle should not be seen, for it is one against many." (12) Then Jarasandha, desiring a righteous war, spoke, "Let each of you fight him one by one for the sake of the maiden." (9) Then, the warrior Shourya, eager to conquer the enemy, engaged in battle. The rest of the Kshatriyas, envious of the battlefield, became spectators. (9) Shourya, from afar, shot arrows at the enemy, Shatrujaya, and, having shattered his chariot and armor, left him unconscious. (15) Then, the proud Dattavakt, who had fought for a long time, engaged in battle. Shourya, having broken his chariot and stripped him of his valor, drove him away. (16) The enemy, Kalamukha, who was as fierce as Yama, approached the battlefield. The Yadava, Vasudeva, having left him with only his breath, drove him away. (97) Shalya, riding in his chariot and wielding sharp arrows, approached. The Vrishni, Vasudeva, bound him with the terrible Jambhana weapon. (98) Then, Jarasandha quickly said to Samudravijaya, "O king, you are skilled in weaponry, so quickly vanquish his pride in battle." (99) Although Samudravijaya was a knower of justice and did not want to fight, he rose at the command of King Jarasandha. It is right, for even those who know justice often follow their master in battle. (100) Then, at the command of Samudravijaya, the chariot, driven by the charioteer, with a high flag and umbrella, rushed towards Vasudeva's chariot. (101) Seeing his elder brother's chariot from afar, Vasudeva said to his charioteer, "Know him to be my elder brother, Samudravijaya." (102) "O Dadhimukha, he is like our father, so you should drive the chariot slowly before him. I must fight him in the battlefield, keeping in mind his protection." (103) The charioteer, Dadhimukha, drove the chariot as Vasudeva commanded, so that even though he was urged on, he moved slowly towards the chariot of his elder brother. (104)

---------------------------
The Thirty-First Canto

The ocean-conqueror, seated on his chariot, spoke. "O Bhadra! Why does my heart feel so affectionate seeing this warrior?" (105)

"The twitching of my right eye and arm, indicative of a meeting with a relative, how can it be auspicious in the midst of battle, when the enemy is standing before me? Tell me." (106)

"There has never been an experience of discord in auspicious signs, and due to the opposition of time and place, even the concordance of signs is not appropriate." (107)

Hearing this, the charioteer said, "My lord, you are now facing the enemy. When you conquer him, there will surely be a meeting with a relative." (108)

"O King! This enemy is invincible by others. Therefore, by conquering him, you will surely receive special honor from Jarasandha, the king of kings, in the presence of the kings." (109)

Praising the charioteer's words, the ocean-conqueror lifted his bow, drew an arrow from his quiver, and stood ready with the arrow in his hand. He said to Kumar Vasudeva, "O brave one! As I have seen your skill with the bow in battle, so perform the same feat before me. Show me your prowess." (110-111)

"O mountain of valor! Your peak of pride, like a mountain, is still uncovered. I will cover it with clouds of arrows. I am the ocean-conqueror." (112)

The Kumar, changing his voice, said, "O King! What is the use of much talk? Our prowess will be revealed in battle. Whoever is what, will be revealed." (113)

"If you are the ocean-conqueror, then I am the battle-conqueror. If you have no doubt, then quickly place an arrow on your bow and release it." (114)

Hearing this, the king, whose middle had been released and who was standing in the Vaishākha posture, placed an arrow on the string, drew it back, and shot it with great force in anger. (115)

On the other hand, Vasudeva, adorned with the Vaishākha posture, quickly cut the ocean-conqueror's arrow in mid-flight with his own arrow, from a distance. (116)

Thus, the king, the ocean-conqueror, released many arrows in battle, and Vasudeva, with his arrows, quickly countered them all from a distance. (117)

Then, those who were skilled in the art of weaponry, and the kings, fought with divine weapons. The people cheered and praised them for a long time. (118)

Page #436:
---------------------------
398
In the Harivamsha Purana, the elder brother released arrows aimed at the warriors, charioteers, and horses. The younger brother, like Garuda, pierced them with his arrows. ||119|| He cut each arrow into three pieces with his sword, and then pierced the chariots, charioteers, and horses with his weapons. ||120|| Seeing his skill with weapons, the kings praised him. Some shook their heads, some snapped their fingers, and some uttered the words "Sadhu, Sadhu." ||121|| The elder brother, unaware of their relationship, angrily released a divine Raudra weapon, a thousand arrows in a thousand. ||122|| The young man, quickly releasing the Brahma-Shiras weapon, which could cover other weapons, cut the Raudra weapon in mid-air. ||123|| Vasudeva's skill in battle was supreme. He cut down various weapons but protected his elder brother. ||124||
Thus, playing the game of war, Vasudeva, whose heart was filled with affection, sent an arrow marked with his name to his elder brother. The arrow moved slowly towards his elder brother. ||125|| King Samudravijaya took the arrow and read the message: "O Maharaj! I am your younger brother Vasudeva, who had disappeared. After a hundred years, I have returned to my family. I bow at your feet." ||126-127||
Overwhelmed by brotherly love, Samudravijaya threw away his bow and quickly descended from his chariot to meet his younger brother. ||128||
Vasudeva also quickly descended from his chariot and prostrated himself at his brother's feet from a distance. Samudravijaya lifted him up and embraced him. ||129|| Both brothers embraced each other and wept, tears streaming down their faces. At that moment,

## Chapter Thirty-One: The Gathering of Brothers and Rohini's Swayamvara

All the brothers-in-law, sons, and relatives of Vasudeva gathered there, embracing and weeping.  ||131||

Jarasandha and the other kings were delighted to see this reunion of brothers. They praised Rohini, her brothers, father, and other relatives. ||132||

At the end of the day, the kings returned to their respective camps. They spent their days and nights immersed in the stories of Vasudeva. ||133||

On an auspicious day, when the moon was in the Rohini constellation, Vasudeva married Rohini according to the proper rituals. ||134||

Jarasandha, Samudravijaya, and the other kings were overjoyed at the wedding and stayed at King Rudhira's palace for a year. ||135||

Vasudeva, having been honored for his assistance in the battle, took leave of Dadhimuka, who was pleased and returned to his own place. ||136||

Vasudeva, captivated by his new bride, was like a bee drawn to the lotus of her beautiful face. He did not even remember his previous wives. ||137||

**The Power of Tapas**

Like a lion playing, Vasudeva, the mountain of valor, stood alone on the battlefield, his arms his only support. He was the embodiment of extraordinary prowess. All the greedy kings of the earth, united in their desire to defeat him, failed. This is the power of tapas, as spoken by the Jinas. ||138||

Thus ends the thirty-first chapter of the Harivamsa, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which narrates the story of Rohini's Swayamvara and the gathering of brothers, a part of the Arishta-nemi Purana. ||31||

## Chapter Thirty-Two

Then, one day, Rohini, while lying on a beautiful bed with her husband Vasudeva, saw four auspicious dreams. ||1||

In the first dream, she saw a majestic elephant, white like the moon, with a deep roar. In the second dream, she saw a vast ocean, with towering waves and a thunderous roar. In the third dream, she saw the full moon, fulfilling her desires, and in the fourth dream, she saw a lion, white as a jasmine flower, entering her mouth. ||2-3||

Awakening in the morning, with eyes like blooming lotuses, Rohini recounted these dreams to her husband. He interpreted them, saying, "My dear, you will soon have a son, who will be wise, valiant, invincible, radiant like the moon, a unique hero, the lord of the earth, and beloved by the people." ||4-5||

Hearing this auspicious interpretation of her dreams from her husband, the beautiful Rohini was overjoyed and her face shone like the moon. ||6||

At that very moment, the great celestial being, Maha Shukra, fell from heaven and entered Rohini's womb, just as a precious gem is embedded in the earth. ||7||

After nine months, Rohini, whose womb was full, gave birth to a son, beautiful like the moon, under auspicious stars. ||8||

Seeing the birth of this son, King Rudhira, along with Jarasandha and other kings who had been staying at his palace for a year, were delighted and returned to their respective kingdoms. King Rudhira honored them all with great hospitality. ||9||

This child, named Rama, grew up, spreading his fame throughout the earth, bringing joy to his parents and relatives. ||10||

One day, all the brothers, including Samudravijaya, were gathered in the grand hall of King Rudhira's palace, eager to serve Vasudeva, when a divine Vidya-dhari descended from the sky and greeted them. ||11||

She addressed Vasudeva, saying, "…." ||12||

## Chapter Thirty-Two

Oh Dev! Your wife Vegavati and my daughter Balachandra wish to see your feet.  ||13|| The young Balachandra's life is bound to you, so go and marry her quickly, fulfilling her heart's desire. ||14|| Hearing this, the Vidhyadhari looked at her elder brother Samudravijaya, who, understanding her intention, said, "Go quickly" and dismissed them. ||15|| Taking Vasudeva with her, she went to Gaganavallabhapur, while Samudravijaya and the other kings went to Shauryapur. ||16|| Seeing his wife Vegavati in Gaganavallabhapur, Shauri married Balachandra, whose face was like the full moon. ||17|| He spent some happy days there, enjoying himself with his new bride Balachandra and his beloved Vegavati. ||18|| After some days, Vasudeva expressed his desire to return to Shauryapur with both his wives. Hearing this, Vanavati Devi, the mother of his previous wife, created a magnificent chariot adorned with jewels and gave it to him. ||19|| Seeing this, Balachandra's father Kanchanadanshtr and Vegavati's elder brother Manasvega, along with the entire family, handed over Balachandra and Vegavati to Vasudeva. ||20|| With both his wives, Vasudeva boarded the chariot, which moved according to his will, and went to Arinjaya-pur, where he met Vidyudvega. ||21|| From there, he took his beloved Madanvega and her son Anaavrushni and flew away in the same chariot. ||22|| Soon, he reached the prosperous and fragrant city of Gandhasamruddh, where he met the daughter of the Gandhara king, Prabhavati. ||23|| He then boarded the chariot with his family and, filled with great joy, reached the city of Asitparvat. ||24|| There, he met the daughter of King Singhadanshtr, Priya Neelayasha, and they engaged in various forms of play, reunited after their separation. ||25|| He then took her with him and reached the city of Kinnarodgit, where he brought the beautiful Shyama, whose complexion was like the petals of a blue lotus. ||26||

Having obtained Shyama from Shravasti, Harivansh went to Mahapur, taking with him Priyangusundari and Bandhumati. From Mahapur, he took Priyasomashri and went to Ilavardhanpur. From there, he took the honorable Ratnawati and went to Bhadrailpur. From there, he took Charuhaasini and established her brother Paundu there, and then went to Jaipur. From there, he took Ashvasena and went to Shalguhapur. From there, he took Padmavati and went to Vedasampur. 27-30
There, he crowned his son Kapil and then went to Achalgram with Kapila. 31
From there, he took Mitrashri and went to Tilavastu. From there, he took five hundred maidens and went to Giritat. 32
From there, he took Somashri and went to Champapuri. From there, he took the minister's daughter and Gandharvasena and went to Vijayakhet. There, he met his son Akrurdrishti and took Vijayasen and went to Kulpur. 33-34
From there, he took Padmashri, Avantisundari, Surrasena with his son, Jara, Jivadyasha, and his other wives, and returned with great joy in a swift-moving chariot. 35-36
His chariot, adorned with beautiful music, and shining like the sun's chariot, quickly reached Shauryapur. 37
Then, Vanavati Devi, having heard of Vasudeva's arrival, herself went to greet him and, filled with joy, increased the prosperity of King Samudravijaya. 38
Then, King Samudravijaya, with great joy, adorned the city with his people and, with respect, went to meet Vasudeva with his relatives. 39
Vasudeva, with all his wives, descended from the chariot and bowed to his elder brothers and other teachers. Others, filled with love, bowed to Vasudeva. 40
Shiva and other queens, with tears of joy in their eyes, embraced Vasudeva, bowed to him, and, looking towards the sky, repeatedly blessed him, saying, "May there be no separation again." 41
The prince honored the people as they deserved, and the people showed him respect. 1. Dhanavati M.

## Chapter 32: The Gathering of All Mothers and Daughters

**403**

Seeing the conquest of the ocean and Vasudeva, the celestial being, Vanavati, pleased and with her purpose fulfilled, went to her own place. **43**

**Sārdūlavikrīḍita**

The people of Śaurayapura, who were themselves valiant, said, "This is the glory of the Jain Dharma, earned in the past, that we see in Vasudeva, who is valiant, who has conquered the kings, who is of noble and beautiful character, who is the beloved of the Vidyadharis, who is like a god, and who has attained great wealth." **44**

Thus ends the thirty-second chapter of the Harivamsa, composed by Jinaseṇācārya, which is a collection of the Arishṭanemi Purāṇa, and which describes the gathering of all mothers and daughters. **32**

**End of the Vidyadhara Kāṇḍa**

1. Vasudeva is the moon in the lunar mansion.
2. Vegavati is the name of a river.

## Chapter Thirty-Three

Then, the king Vasudeva, being requested by the noble princes, his sons, stayed in Suryapura, teaching them the art of warfare. ||1||

One day, Kumar Vasudeva, proficient in the art of archery, along with his disciples like Kansa, went to Rajagriha, desiring to see King Jarasandha. ||2||

At that time, Rajagriha was adorned with a multitude of kings who had come from different places. At that very moment, a proclamation was made by King Jarasandha for the attentive ears of the people, which Vasudeva also heard. ||3||

The proclamation stated, "The king of Singhapura, Simharatha, is very arrogant. He rides on a chariot drawn by real lions and possesses immense valor. The man who captures him alive and brings him before us will be considered the bravest and most valiant man in the world." ||4-5||

"To that man, who drinks the ocean of the enemy's fame, we will offer him wealth as a mark of respect. And after that, he will also receive this rare and additional reward." ||6||

"I will give him my daughter, Jeevadhyasha, whose fame rests at the end of the directions, along with the desired land, because of her exceptional qualities." ||7||

Hearing this captivating proclamation, Vasudeva, filled with the spirit of heroism, asked Kansa to accept the flag. Meaning, Vasudeva encouraged Kansa to accept the flag as a pledge to capture Simharatha. ||8||

Then, Vasudeva, taking Kansa with him, mounted a chariot drawn by lions made of knowledge and went to Singhapura. When Simharatha, riding on a chariot drawn by lions, came to face Vasudeva for battle, he cut the reins of his lions with arrows, causing them to flee. ||9||

At that moment, Kansa, following his guru's command, leaped forward and captured the enemy. Seeing Kansa's skill, Vasudeva said to him, 

*The text has the following verse after the first verse:*

Seeing Kansa's skill, Vasudeva said, "Choose your reward. Stay here by my side." ||2||

Page #443:
---------------------------
Chapter Thirty-Three:

"Grant me a boon," said Jarasandha. "Stay, Acharya, in your own house." Vasudeva showed him the infant, saying, "This is the enemy." [11]

Seeing the infant, Jarasandha was pleased and said to Vasudeva, "Marry your daughter to this boy." Vasudeva replied, "The enemy was captured by Kamsa, not by me." [12]

Jarasandha asked Kamsa about his lineage. Kamsa replied, "O King, my mother, Manjoudari, lives in Kaushambi and is a brewer." [13]

Hearing Kamsa's words, the king thought, "His appearance belies his claim of being the son of a brewer." [14]

Jarasandha then sent his men to Kaushambi to bring Manjoudari. She arrived with a casket and a seal bearing her name. [15]

The king questioned her about the infant's origin. She replied, "O Lord, I found him in the Yamuna river along with this casket." [16]

"O King, I felt compassion for this infant and raised him, even though I faced countless reproaches for doing so." [17]

"This child is naturally fierce and harsh-tongued. Though virtuous, he seems unfortunate. He would play with children, but only by slapping their heads. He would go to houses to buy liquor and harass the girls there by pulling their braids and tormenting them." [18-19]

"Fearing the censure of the people for his behavior, I abandoned him. He wanted to learn the art of warfare, so he became someone's disciple." [20]

"This casket is his mother, not me. I have no connection to his virtues or vices. Here is the casket," she said, showing the casket to the king. When the casket was opened, a seal bearing her name was found inside. King Jarasandha took it and read it. [21-22]

It read, "This is the son of Ugrasena and Padmavati. He was fierce even in the womb. He was abandoned because of his fierceness. May he live, and may his own actions protect him." [23]

Reading the seal, King Jarasandha realized that the infant was his nephew. He was overjoyed and gave his daughter, who was endowed with many virtues, to him. [24]

Page #444:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, 
Kansa was enraged that his father had not freed him at birth. He sought and obtained the kingdom of Mathura from Jarasandha, and with all his resources at his disposal, he went to Mathura with his wife, Jivadyaasha.  ||25|| Being cruel, Kansa went to war with his father, Ugrasena, and defeated him, quickly binding him. ||26||  Kansa, who was extremely fierce and had petty ambitions, confined his father, King Ugrasena, to the main gate of the city, preventing him from moving freely. ||27|| 
Kansa, being grateful for Vasudeva's kindness, wanted to reciprocate, but he couldn't decide how. He always considered himself Vasudeva's servant. ||28|| One day, with great devotion, he brought Vasudeva to Mathura and, as a guru-dakshina, gave him his sister, Devaki. ||29||  Thereafter, Vasudeva, at Kansa's insistence, resided in Mathura, playing with Devaki, who was radiant and spoke sweet words. ||30|| Kansa, who tormented his enemies and was greatly favored by Jarasandha, ruled Mathura, the capital of the vast country of Shurasena. ||31|| 
One day, Kansa's elder brother, Ati Muktak Muni, came to the royal palace for a meal. Kansa's wife, Jivadyaasha, stood before the Muni, showing off, and with a playful smile, said, "This is your sister Devaki's garment of joy. Look at it." ||32-33|| The Muni, who knew the state of the world, broke his vow of silence to stop Jivadyaasha, who was arrogant and intoxicated by her royal splendor. He said, "Oh, you are laughing, but this is your great folly. You are finding joy even in a place of sorrow." ||34-35||  "Be certain that the son born from Devaki's womb will kill your husband and father. This is inevitable." ||36|| 
Hearing this, Jivadyaasha was terrified, and tears streamed from her eyes. She immediately left the Muni and went to her husband, believing that the Muni's words were true. ||37||

## Chapter Thirty-Three

**407**

Hearing this, Kansa, filled with doubt, quickly went to Vasudeva, the truthful one, who was in the forest, and bowed at his feet. 

**38**

"O Master! Your blessings are surely to be given to me. I wish that Devaki should reside in my house at the time of her delivery."

**39**

Vasudeva, unaware of the truth, granted him the boon, being foolish.  How could one suspect that harm could come to a sister in her brother's house?

**40**

Later, when he learned the truth, he was filled with remorse. He went to the liberated Muni, Ati-Muktaka, who resided in the mango grove, and bowed to him along with Devaki. After receiving his blessings, he asked the question that was in his mind.

**41-42**

"O Lord! What did Kansa do in a previous birth that made him so wicked, a foe to his own father? And how will my son be the destroyer of this wicked Kansa? I wish to know, please tell me."

**43**

The Muni Ati-Muktaka, with eyes that shone with divine knowledge, replied, for the words of those who possess divine vision destroy all doubts.

**44**

"O beloved of the gods, O King! Listen, your question is dear to all. I will tell you what you seek to know, according to your question."

**45**

"In this very city of Mathura, when King Ugrasena ruled, there lived a sage named Vasishtha, who had performed the five-fire penance.

**46**

He was an ignorant sage, standing on one leg, with raised arms and long matted hair, performing austerities on the banks of the Yamuna."

**47**

"There, women came to draw water. One day, a water-carrier named Priyangulatika, the beloved of Jina-das Seth, also came there. Other water-carriers, who were wise, said to Priyangulatika, "O Priyangulatika!

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

408
In the Harivamsha Purana, it is stated that the women servants (Ghatadasis) of the people there spoke thus. It was told by the attendants (Chetikas) of Jinadasa, who had the welfare of the ascetic (Jina) in mind. ||49||

They said, "Quickly pay obeisance to him." But she (Priyangulika) said, "I have no devotion towards him at all. What shall I do?" ||50||

Then, forcibly made to bow, she spoke angrily to the fisherman (Dhivara), "I have been made to fall at the feet of the unworthy one. Foolish-minded!" ||51||

He (the ascetic) went to the presence of the king and complained about Jinadatta, the merchant, without any cause. ||52||

The king summoned Jinadatta and asked him. He replied, "Lord, I have not even seen him. Has the Muni (ascetic) cursed me?" ||53||

The king then questioned the servant-girl. She said, "You wicked one! Why do you not pay obeisance to the Muni and criticize him in anger?" ||54||

The Muni said, "This is not a Muni, but a foolish fisherman. Nowhere is the purity of his matted locks seen." ||55||

When he was examined, many tiny fish were found in his matted locks, at which the people laughed and mocked him as a liar. ||56||

When he was tested by the king, he, displaying his ignorance, went out from Mathura. ||57||

Reaching Varanasi, he resolved to perform austerities on the bank of the Ganga. ||58||

Guru Virabhadra came there with five hundred disciples. One newly initiated disciple praised this ascetic, saying, "Ah! This is the great ascetic Vashishtha." ||59||

The Guru stopped him, saying, "How is he ignorant?" He replied, "You inflict harm on the six classes of living beings, hence you are ignorant." ||60||

In the penance of the five fires, the contact with fire is inevitable. By that, the five senses, the imperfect senses, and the single-sensed beings are certainly burnt. ||61||

## Chapter Thirty-Three

**409**

How can an ignorant being attain control over the senses when the earth, water, fire, air, and plants, as well as other living beings, are constantly being harmed?  ||13||

Similarly, how can a person who is detached but still holds onto false views, false knowledge, and false conduct attain control over the senses through right knowledge? ||14||

How can a person who only practices austerities of the body, is filled with pride, and lacks proper restraint, attain liberation through such austerities? ||15||

Only the Jain path is the right path, and it is through this path that one can attain restraint, austerities, right faith, right conduct, and knowledge that illuminates all things. ||16||

"O ascetic, you know that your father has become a snake and is burning in this fuel, enveloped in flames and smoke." ||17||

Upon hearing this, the ascetic split the wood with an axe and saw the snake burning and writhing within. ||18||

"Your father's name was Brahma, and he followed the same path of asceticism as you. It is because of this that he has met this unfortunate end. You too are ignorant, and you should learn from this." ||19||

Realizing that the Jain path is based on right knowledge, Vashishtha, the ascetic, went to Veerabhadra, his guru, and took Jain initiation. ||20-21||

Many monks practiced austerities with him, but due to the ripening of the karma of gain and hindrance, only Vashishtha was deprived of the benefit of alms. He received very little alms. ||22||

To help him overcome this and to gain deeper knowledge of the Agamas, Veerabhadra entrusted Vashishtha to Shiv Gupta, the monk. ||23||

After six months of austerity, Shiv Gupta entrusted Vashishtha to Veer Datta, the monk. Veer Datta kept him for six months and then entrusted him to Sumati, the monk, who also cared for him for six months. ||24||

Vashishtha, having learned the rules of monastic conduct from many gurus and having become adept at enduring hardships, became known as Ekavihari, a solitary wanderer. ||25||

While wandering, the great ascetic Vashishtha arrived in Mathura, where he was revered by the people as a guru. ||26||

**Note:** 1. Vashishtha was devoted to austerities. 2. Among those who practiced austerities. 3. He became a virtuous person while practicing austerities. 

**52**

**Living beings are definitely burning.** ||62||

In the Harivamsha Purana,
The sage Vashishtha was performing the Tapana Yoga on the peak of a mountain. Seven goddesses, who were under his control due to his penance, approached him and asked, "What can we do for you, O Devata?" || 76 ||
The sage, who was a treasure trove of penance, replied, "I have no work for you." He dismissed them, and the goddesses, who were under his control, departed. || 77 ||
The sage Vashishtha was observing a fast for a month, without any desire for food. All the people wanted to offer him food during the Parana (breaking of the fast). || 78 ||
Once, King Ugrasena requested the people of Mathura to let him offer the Parana food to the sage. He stopped all the donors in Mathura from offering food. || 79 ||
The king forgot to offer the Parana food to the sage on three occasions. On the first occasion, he was busy with the arrival of Jarasandha's messenger. On the second occasion, a fire broke out, and he was preoccupied with managing it. On the third occasion, an elephant caused chaos in the city, and he was distracted by it. || 80 ||
The sage wandered through the entire city of Mathura in search of food, but he couldn't find any. Finally, exhausted from his efforts, he rested at the city gate. || 81 ||
Seeing him, someone said, "Alas, what a terrible thing the king has done! He himself did not offer food to the sage, and he also forbade others from doing so." || 82 ||
Hearing this, the sage was filled with anger. He remembered the goddesses who had come to him earlier. As soon as he remembered them, they appeared before him. Seeing them, he said, "You should do my work in another birth." The goddesses accepted his command and departed. The sage then left for the forest. || 83 ||
To humiliate King Ugrasena, the sage Vashishtha made a strong resolution: "I will be born as his son and take revenge." Due to this resolution, he was corrupted from his sagehood and entered the Mithyatva Gunasthan (state of falsehood). At that moment, he died and entered the womb of Queen Padmavati, the wife of King Ugrasena. || 84 ||
When Kansa's soul was in the womb of Padmavati, her body became extremely weak. One day, the king asked her in private, "My beloved, what is your ailment? Why have you become so thin and weak?" Padmavati replied, "My lord, the ailment I have due to the defect in the womb is not something that can be spoken of." || 85 ||
The king said, "It is necessary to speak about it. Tell me." || 86 ||

## Chapter Thirty-Three

With a voice choked with sorrow, she said, "O Lord, I wish to tear open your belly and drink your blood!" || 87 ||

Then, by the counsel of the ministers, her doha was completed. Nine months later, Queen Padmavati gave birth to a son whose face was extremely contorted by his brows. || 88 ||

Since the child was extremely fierce from the womb, Queen Padmavati, out of fear, placed him in a casket and had it released into the flow of the Yamuna in a secluded place. || 89 ||

The casket floated along the river and reached the city of Kaushambi. There, a woman who made swords found it and named the child Kansa, raising him as her own. O King, you already know the rest of the story. || 90 ||

Due to the defects of his karma, he imprisoned his father. Your son will kill him and free his father, King Ugrasena from his bonds. || 91 ||

O King, I have told you the story of Kansa and why he imprisoned his father. Now, listen with a steady mind as I tell you the story of your sons. || 92 ||

Devaki's seventh son will be the bearer of the conch, discus, mace, and sword. He will kill Kansa and his other enemies and rule the entire earth. || 93 ||

The remaining six sons will be of the highest order. They will not die untimely deaths, so abandon your anxieties. || 94 ||

I will tell you the past lives of all of them, including Ramabhadra (Balarama). Listen to them with your wife, for they will surely bring joy to your heart. || 95 ||

When King Shurasena was protecting Mathurapuri, there lived a wealthy merchant named Bhanu, who was the master of twelve crore mudras. His wife's name was Yamuna. || 96 ||

They had seven sons: Subhanu, Bhanukirti, Bhanushena, Shura, Suradeva, Shuradatta, and Shurasena. All seven brothers were extremely handsome and naturally inclined towards each other. || 97-98 ||

The seven wives of these brothers were, in order, Kalindi, Tilaka, Kanta, Shrikant, Sundari, Dyuti, and Chandrakant. They were all daughters of noble families. || 99 ||

Perhaps Bhanu, the merchant, was near the guru Abhayanadi, and his wife Yamuna was near... || 100 ||

All seven brothers lost their father's wealth in gambling and prostitution. When they had nothing left, they all went to Ujjayini city to steal. ||1.1|| They left their youngest brother in the Mahakal forest for his protection and the remaining six brothers entered the city at night without any fear. ||102|| At that time, the king of Ujjayini was Vrishabhadhwaja. His wife's name was Kamala. King Vrishabhadhwaja had a valiant warrior named Dridhamusti. His wife's name was Vaprshri. They had a son named Vajramusti. When he reached the age of puberty and was afflicted by lust, he requested King Vimala Chandra to give him his daughter, Manghi, born to Queen Vimala. ||103-104|| Manghi was very dear to Vajramusti. She was always with him like a Veena and did not serve her mother-in-law, meaning she never served her. Therefore, her mother-in-law was constantly filled with malice and was always plotting her destruction. One day, she was scheming to kill her when the time for the spring festival arrived. Her son, Vajramusti, went to the pleasure garden with the king and told Manghi, "Oh Manghi! You should follow me soon." ||105-107|| However, the mother-in-law did not allow Manghi to go to the spring festival. This wicked woman had already summoned a poisonous snake from a pot. Seeing the opportunity, she told Manghi, "Don't be sad that you couldn't go to the spring festival. I have already kept a beautiful garland for you. Go and take it out of the pot and wear it." The innocent Manghi, lured by the garland, put her hand into the pot and was bitten by the venomous snake. ||108|| Manghi immediately fainted from the venom. Her mother-in-law had her carried away by her servants to the Mahakal cremation ground, which was terrifying even to Yama, the god of death. ||109|| When Vajramusti returned home at night and learned of the incident, he went to the Mahakal cremation ground in search of his beloved Manghi with great affection. ||110|| At that time, he had a shining sword in his hand. With its power, he entered the cremation ground without fear. As he walked, he saw Vardharma Muni sitting in the cremation ground in the posture of a night-long statue. ||111|| 
Jindatta Ayika took initiation from him. ||100||

## Chapter Thirty-Three

He circumambulated the Muni three times, bowed down and said, "O Muni! If I obtain Mangī, I will worship your feet with a thousand lotuses." ||112||

Having said this, he proceeded and found his wife Mangī. He brought her to the Muni and by the touch of the Muni's feet, he made her free from poison. ||113||

Then, saying, "Stay near the Muni's feet until I return," he left for the lake called Sudarśana, desiring to bring a lotus. ||114||

Śūrasena, hidden nearby, had seen the great affection of Vajramuṣṭi for Mangī. Desiring to know her mind, he revealed his form to her. He was indeed handsome. ||115||

Concealing his intentions, he engaged in sweet talk and secret counsel with her. Mangī, upon seeing him, became overwhelmed with desire. ||116||

In that state of infatuation, she went to Śūrasena and said, "O Lord! Please accept me." Hearing Mangī's plea, Śūrasena said, "How can I do that while your husband is alive? My dear, I am indeed afraid of that powerful warrior." In response, Mangī, filled with love, said, "O Lord! Do not fear him. I will kill him with my sword right now." Śūrasena replied, "If that is the case, then I accept you." Saying this, he stood hidden there, desiring to witness her deed. ||117-119||

Then, Vajramuṣṭi came and worshipped the Muni's feet. As he bowed down, Mangī attempted to strike his head with her sword, but Śūrasena swiftly intervened and snatched the sword away. ||120||

Seeing this, Śūrasena became detached from the world and left without revealing himself. Mangī, suspecting his touch, pretended to be possessed by Maya and fell to the ground. ||121||

Vajramuṣṭi, unaware of her evil deed, asked her, "My dear, did someone frighten you here? There seems to be no cause for fear here." Thus, having alerted the frightened Mangī, Vajramuṣṭi bowed down to the Muni and then took his wife home. ||122-123||

In the Harivamsha Purana, it is said that after coming together at a crossroads, the six brothers who had stolen the wealth divided it equally and said to Shurasen, "Take your share." ||124||
Shurasen, unwilling to take his share, said, "People commit all sorts of evil deeds behind closed doors, and women are like Vajramushti." ||125||
Seeing and hearing this incident, the six younger brothers, renouncing worldly attachments, took initiation at the feet of the Varadharma Guru, while the elder brother took the wealth to the women. ||126||
When the seven wives of the brothers heard this news, they too renounced worldly attachments and took initiation. Finally, the elder brother, Subhanu, also came to his senses and took initiation from the same Varadharma Guru. ||127||
Later, while traveling with his Guru, the seven monks came to Ujjayini. Seeing them, Vajramushti asked them the reason for taking initiation. They told him the whole story of Vajramushti and Manghi, which made Vajramushti very remorseful, and he immediately took initiation. ||128||
At the same time, the seven Aryikas, traveling with Aryika Jinadatta, also came to Ujjayini. Manghi asked them the reason for their initiation. Hearing their reply, Manghi remembered all his past deeds and took initiation with firm vows. ||129||
After that, the seven monk-kings, bearing the burden of severe austerities, attained Samadhi-death at the end of their lives and became excellent Devas of the Trayastrimsa class in the Saudharma heaven, living for the duration of a Sagar (ocean). ||130||
In the eastern part of the Dhataki-khand Dvipa, in the Bharat-kshetra, there is a mountain called Vijayadhan. In the southern range of this mountain, there is a city called Nitya-loka. ||131||
In this city, King Chitrachul ruled. His wife's name was Manohari. The elder brother Subhanu's life was born as their son named Chitrangad, and the lives of the remaining six brothers were also born as three pairs of sons named Garudakant, Senakant, Garuddhwaj, Garudvahan, Manichul, and Himchul. All of them were excellent and roamed happily in the sky. ||132-133||
All these sons of Chitrachul were very beautiful, eager to acquire many skills, and were like the jewel on the crown of men. ||134||
At that time, in the city of Meghapur, King Dhananjaya, the lord of wealth, ruled. King Dhananjaya and Queen Sarvasri had a very beautiful daughter named Dhansri. ||135||

The thirty-third chapter: Dhanashri's Swayamvara

Dhanashri held a Swayamvara, to which all the Vidyadharas were invited. But the princess chose her father's nephew, Harivahana, as her husband. 136.

The other Vidyadharas were enraged, saying, "Why were we invited to this Swayamvara, when she was going to marry her own relative? This was a deceitful act." 137.

They then started fighting amongst themselves, wanting to kill each other. The son of King Chitrachula, who was also present at the Swayamvara, witnessed this shameful killing of Kshatriyas. He thought, "Oh! These are the evil consequences of indulging in the objects of the senses." Thus, he condemned the objects of the senses and became a disciple of the Bhootananda Jinendra. 138-139.

The seven Muni-Rajas attained Samadhi and became Samanika Devas in the Mahendra heaven, enjoying the fruits of their deeds for seven oceans of lifetimes. 140.

After that, the elder brother's soul was reborn in Hastinapur, the capital of Bharat, as the son of a wealthy merchant named Shankha, born to his wife Bandhumati. 141.

The remaining six brothers were reborn as the sons of King Ganga Deva, in the same city, born to his queen Nandayasha. They were born in three pairs: Ganga, Gangadatta, Gangarakshit, Nanda, Sunanda, and Nandishena. 142-143.

When the queen Nandayasha was pregnant with her seventh child, she was struck by misfortune. She was so distressed that she abandoned the child after its birth. The child was raised by a nurse named Revati. 144.

This abandoned child was named Nirnamak. He was very dear to Shankha, the son of the merchant. One day, Shankha took Nirnamak to a beautiful garden filled with people. 145.

There, the six sons of King Ganga Deva were having a meal together. Seeing them, Shankha said, "Nirnamak is your younger brother. Why don't you invite him to eat with you?" 146.

Hearing this, the princes invited Nirnamak to join them. He sat down to eat with his brothers. At that moment, his mother, Queen Nandayasha, arrived and, in a fit of rage, kicked him. 147.

Shankha was deeply saddened by this incident. He said, "It is because of me that Nirnamak has suffered this pain. I am cursed." Filled with sorrow, he took Nirnamak and left for the forest. 148.

---------------------------
416
Harivansh Purana, in the end of the story of Duman Rishi, Shanku asked him about the past births of Nirnamak. The Muni, knowing the past births, told him as follows:

14. There was a king named Chitra Rath in the city of Giri Purva. His wife was Kanak Malini, a virtuous and beautiful woman.

15. The king was fond of meat. He had a cook named Amrit Rasayan, who was an expert in cooking meat. The king was pleased with his skills and made him the lord of ten villages.

152. The king heard about the demerits of eating meat from Sudharma Muni. Impressed by his words, he gave his kingdom and wealth to his son, Megh Rath, and took initiation with three hundred kings to attain liberation.

153. The new king, Megh Rath, became a Shravak and humiliated the cook, reducing him to the lord of only one village.

154. The cook was enraged by this incident. He thought that the Muni who prohibited meat was the reason for his humiliation. So, he gave the Muni a poisonous meal made of bitter gourd and killed him.

155. The Muni died on Urjayant Giri. Due to his strong meditation, he was reborn as Ahmindra, the lord of the Aparajit Vimana, with an age equal to thirty-two oceans.

156. The cook died and was reborn in the third earth, Baluka Prabha. He suffered the intense pain of hell for three oceans of time.

157-158. From there, he wandered in the great forest of the Tiryanch Gati. Once, he was born as the son of Yakshdatt and Yakshilla, a couple living in the village of Palash, in the Malaya country. His name was Yakshlik. He was foolish by nature and younger than his brother, Yakshsav.

159-160. Once, the wicked Yakshlik was riding in a chariot. An old blind serpent was lying in the middle of the road. Despite his brother's warning, the evil Yakshlik drove the chariot over the serpent, cutting off its tail. The serpent was dying in pain. At that moment, due to the Akamanirjara, she attained the human birth.

161. After that, the serpent died and was reborn in the womb of Vasundhara, the queen of Vasav, the king of Shwetaambika Puri, as Nandayasha.

## Chapter Thirty-Three

**417**

This one, named Nirnama, was a Yaksha-lika, who killed the Muni and was cruel to his mother, thus he incurred her hatred. ||16||

Hearing this, the king, Gangadeva, terrified of the world, entrusted his kingdom to his son, Devananda, and took initiation with two hundred kings near the Muni. ||163||

All the princes and the chief, Shankha, also took initiation. They all performed pure austerities to be freed from the cycle of birth and death. ||164||

The queen, Nandayasha, along with her nurse, Revati, and the merchant's wife, Bandhumati, took initiation near the Aryaika, Suvrata, adorned with the best vows. ||165||

Nirnama, as a Muni, performed the difficult austerity called "Lion-Play" and made the vow to be born as Narayana in the next life. ||166||

Revati, the nurse, attained the human form and became the wife of the merchant, Sudrishti, in the city of Bhadrailsa, and her name is Alaka. ||167||

Gang and the other six sons will be born in Devaki's womb, one after another, in pairs, and they will be mighty heroes, like oceans of valor. ||168||

Hari, the celestial being, the servant of the Indra, will bring the souls of the nurse and Alaka to the sons as soon as they are born, and they will attain youth there. ||169||

The eldest of these sons will be called Nripadatta, the second Devapala, the third Anikadatta, the fourth Anikapalak, the fifth Shatrughna, and the sixth Jitashatru. All your sons will be very similar in appearance, that is, they will have the same form. ||170-171||

All these princes will become disciples of the moon of the Hari-vamsa, the Guru of the three worlds, Shri Neminath Bhagwan, and will attain liberation. ||172||

Nirnama's soul will enter Devaki's womb and become the seventh son. He will be a very valiant hero and will be the ninth Narayana in this Bharat Kshetra. ||173||

Vasudeva, the knower of time, who praises the fortune of the Jain faith, heard from the Muni about the end of Kamsa and the rise of virtue, and he contemplated the rise of virtue. Thus, he became friendly with him, though with indifference. ||161||

And Nirnama, the Yaksha-lika, was born. This Yaksha-lika had killed the Muni in the guise of a cook and had been very cruel to his mother, so he incurred the hatred of his mother, Nandayasha. ||162||

Harivamsha Purana
Hearing the auspicious deeds of his eight sons and beloved Devaki, both in their past and present lives, Yadu attained great joy and praised the Jina Dharma. ||174||

Thus ends the thirty-third chapter of the Harivamsha Purana, composed by Jinaseena Acharya, which is a collection of the Arishtanemi Purana, and narrates the story of Kansa, as well as the domestic lives of Balarama, Vasudeva, and the other sons of Devaki. ||33||

## Chapter Thirty-Four

Hearing about his lineage, Jinendra Devakipriya, delighted, asked the Ati Muktaka Shrenika, "How, O Lord, will the future Jina, the special one of the Hari Vamsa, be?"  Upon hearing this, the Shraman said, "In this very Jambudvipa, in the Videha Kshetra, on the southern bank of the Shitoada river, there is a country called Supadma. In it, there is a city called Singhapura. There, once, lived a king named Arhad-dasa, who was very worthy."

"His wife, Jinadatta, who performed great worship of the Jinas, conceived a son after seeing five auspicious dreams: Lakshmi, elephant, lion, sun, and moon."

"Since this son was never defeated by anyone, his parents named him Aparajita. Aparajita became very famous in both the sky and the earth."

"When he reached his youth, Aparajita married a noble daughter named Priti-mati, adorned with a garland of pure virtues, the daughter of the Chakravrti."

"Besides her, a thousand other auspicious daughters, who were beautiful, noble, and adorned with ornaments of virtues, also played with him."

"One day, King Arhad-dasa, along with his son, went to the beautiful forest called Manohara to worship the pure-vehicle Jina, who was worshipped by the Devas."

"Inspired by the teachings, King Arhad-dasa, along with five hundred kings, took initiation from the same Jina. After his father's initiation, the prince Aparajita took up the kingdom and the pure Samyak Darshan."

"One day, Aparajita heard that the Jina Vimala-vahana and his father Arhad-dasa had attained liberation on the Gandhamadana mountain. Hearing this, he fasted for three days and performed the devotion of liberation."

"Once, King Aparajita, while sitting in the temple, performed the worship of the Arhat image, which was placed in the Jina-image and Chaitya-alaya, which was donated by Kubera, and took the vow of fasting."

In the Harivamsha Purana, at that time, two Muni (Jain monks) descended from the sky. With folded hands, he bowed to them, who were seated comfortably on the earth, and asked, "||12||
My Lord! I am always delighted to see the Jain ascetics, but today, seeing you both, I am experiencing an unprecedented joy, and my natural affection has surged. What is the reason for this? ||13||
The great Muni, like a stream of nectar, said, "O King! The relationship from a previous birth is the one that reveals the abundance of affection. I will tell you about the relationship from the previous birth, listen carefully. ||14||
In the western Videha region, in the western half of Pushkar, there is a city called Ganyapur, located in the northern range of the silver mountain. ||15||
The king of that city was Suryabha, who was truly like the sun in radiance, and his wife was Dharini, who seemed like another earth, noble and extremely beautiful. ||16||
They had three sons named Chintaman, Manogati, and Chapalagati, who were extremely swift, affectionate, and possessed great valor. ||17||
At that time, in the city of Arijayapur, there lived King Arijay, whose wife was Ajit Sena, and they had a beautiful daughter named Pritimathi. ||18||
Pritimathi was proficient in many arts, she was very famous, and she always condemned the hypocrisy of women. One day, she said to her father, "Father! Give me a desired husband." ||19||
Knowing his daughter's feelings, the father said, "Ask for any boon you desire, except for the boon of penance." Hearing her father's reply, Pritimathi said, "Father! If you do not give me the boon of penance, then give me this boon, that I will marry the winner of the Gatiyuddha." ||20-21||
Saying "So be it," the father accepted his daughter's boon, and with the desire to win the Gatiyuddha, he arranged a Swayamvara for his daughter and invited the Vidhyadharas. ||22||
After all the Vidhyadharas arrived, the daughter's father, addressing them all, said, "Whoever among you is capable, let him compete in the Gatiyuddha for my daughter." ||23||
The form of the Gatiyuddha is this: whoever, the groom or the bride, completes a circumambulation of Mount Meru and worships the Jina, the victory of the one who completes it first is considered. ||24||
He was giving religious instructions to women. ||11||
At that very moment, two Muni (Jain monks) with the power of Charan (divine knowledge) descended from the sky. When both the Muni were seated comfortably on the earth, King Aparajit, with folded hands, bowed to them and asked, "||12||
O Lord! I am always delighted to see the Jain ascetics, but today, seeing you both, I am experiencing an unprecedented joy, and my natural affection has surged. What is the reason for this? ||13||

Chapter Forty-Three

421. The maiden who is victorious in the speed contest, she shall be married by that hero who fulfills the desires of my heart. ||25||

Hearing this, the celestial beings remained silent, knowing her to be highly learned. But the sons of Dharini, filled with the zeal of knowledge, rose to fight the speed contest. ||26||

Then, having bound their minds and bodies together, they were released by the world, having attained the state of neutrality. ||27||

Driven by ego, the four of them ran through the sky, aiming for Mount Meru, stopping the wind with their speed. They ran together for half the distance, but then the maiden left them behind. She circled Mount Meru, worshipped the Jina images in the Bhadrashala forest, and returned first. ||28-29||

Covered in sweat, which looked like pearls, she came and bowed to her father, offering him the remaining offerings from the worship. The father was overjoyed at his daughter's victory. ||30||

Then, the father, freed from the desire for worldly pleasures, gave permission to the victorious maiden to take vows. She, adorned with a multitude of vows, took initiation from the Aryika Nirvritti. ||31||

The three brothers, defeated by Pritimati in the speed contest, also took initiation from the Damvara Muni Raja. ||32||

At the end of their lifespan, the three brothers attained the lifespan of seven oceans in the last realm of the Maheindra heaven, becoming gods of the Samanika caste. They enjoyed the divine pleasures there. ||33||

Then, O King! In the northern part of the Vijayardha region of Pushkalavati, there is a city called Gaganavallabha. There lived King Gaganachandra and his wife, Gagan Sundari. Our elder brother, Chintagati, fell from the Maheindra heaven, and we, Amitvega and Amittej, were born to them in that order. ||34-35||

We took initiation in the city of Pundarikinya, near the Self-Luminous Jina. From him, we heard about our previous lives. O King! The Self-Luminous Jina told us that your elder brother, Chintagati, fell from the Maheindra heaven long ago. ||36||

They came to see you, driven by the desire to see someone greater than themselves, having fallen from the Maheindra heaven, undefeated. ||37||

The worship of the Jina, the Lord, is the first and foremost thing to be done. Only then can one be considered victorious. ||24||

Page #460:

422
In the Harivamsha Purana, it is prophesied that you, O Aparajita, will be born as the Tirthankara Arishtanemi in the fifth future birth in the Harivamsha Mahavansha lineage of the Bharat Kshetra. ||38||
Your remaining lifespan is now only one month, so engage in self-benefit. Having said this, and after inquiring from King Aparajita, the two ascetics departed. ||39||
Hearing the words worthy of being heard from the Charana Shraman, King Aparajita, though delighted, remained thoughtful for a long time about the passing of his time for penance. ||40||
For eight days, he worshipped the Jina, and finally, entrusting the kingdom's fortune to his son Pritikara, he became detached from his body and possessions. ||41||
Then, adorned with the renunciation of the Praayopagaman, for twenty-two days and nights, he performed the four types of worship, and attained the Indra position in the Achyuta heaven, with a lifespan of twenty-two oceans. ||42||
Born in Gajapura, he was the son of Shrichandra and Shrimati, named Supratishtha. He was imbued with the Jina's teachings. ||43||
King Shrichandra, like the moon, established his son Supratishtha on the throne and, after receiving initiation from the guru Sumandera, attained liberation. ||44||
This king, Supratishtha, once gave a donation to the month-long fasting ascetic Yashodhara, receiving in return the five wonders, including the earth. ||45||
On another occasion, during the night of Kartik Purnima, King Supratishtha was seated on the roof of his palace, surrounded by his eight hundred wives. At that time, a meteor fell from the sky. Seeing this, he began to consider the fortune of the kingdom as fleeting, like a meteor. Therefore, he gave the kingdom to his son Sudrishti, born to his queen Sunanda, and received initiation from the great guru Sumandera. ||46-47||
Along with King Supratishtha, four thousand kings, radiant like the sun, also undertook rigorous penance. ||48||
Muni Supratishtha, endowed with knowledge, vision, conduct, penance, and strength, studied the eleven Angas and fourteen Purvas, including the esoteric teachings, without any laziness. He adorned his body with various types of penance, starting with Sarvatobhadra and ending with Simhanishkridita. ||49-50||
O Yadava! Listen, with your mind focused for a moment, to the great rules of fasting, which destroy sins simply by hearing them. ||51||

## Chapter Forty-Three

**423**

In the *Ekādi-Pūpavāsa* (fasting on the first day of the lunar fortnight) and the *Pañcānta* (fasting on the fifth day of the lunar fortnight), the *aṅga* (limbs) are arranged in order. At the beginning and end of the *aṅga*, the remaining *aṅga* are born from the *aṅga* itself. ||5||

This *catur-aśra* (square) *prastāra* (arrangement) is conceived as having five *aṅga*. All around, the *upavāsa* (fasts) are counted as fifteen. ||53||

These are multiplied by five, the number being seventy-five. Multiplied by five, the five *pārāṇā* (breaking of the fast) are twenty-five. ||54||

This is called the *Sarvatobhadra* (all-auspicious) *upavāsa* method. It bestows the *nirvāṇa* (liberation) and the *abhyudaya* (progress) of *udaya* (rising). ||55||

In the *Pañcādi* (beginning with five) and *Navānta* (ending with nine), the *Madottare-vasantaka* (spring-like) method is followed. There, the *upavāsa* are thirty-five in number. ||56||

In the *Saptānta* (ending with seven) and *Ekapūrva* (beginning with one), the *prastāra* has seven *aṅga*. At the beginning and end of the *aṅga*, the *sarva-bhaṅga* (all-breaking) are arranged in order. ||57||

There are twenty-eight *iṣṭa* (desirable) in all, and seven *pārāṇā*. This is the *Mahā-sarvatobhadra* (great all-auspicious), the means of achieving the *Sarvatobhadra*. ||58||

Where the *rūpānta* (transformations) begin with five, and the *dvayādya* (beginning with two) are *catur-antaka* (ending with four), and the *vyādya* (beginning with three) are *rūpānta* (transformations), that is known as the *Triloka-sāra* (essence of the three worlds) method. ||59||

Page #462:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, the expansion of the three worlds is described. This involves thirty Dharanas (fasts) and eleven Paranas (breaking of fasts). The sequence is as follows: five fasts, one breaking of fast, four fasts, one breaking of fast, three fasts, one breaking of fast, two fasts, one breaking of fast, one fast, one breaking of fast, two fasts, one breaking of fast, three fasts, one breaking of fast, four fasts, one breaking of fast, three fasts, one breaking of fast, two fasts, one breaking of fast, and one fast, one breaking of fast. This method takes forty-one days. The fruit of this method is the attainment of Siddhis like Koṣṭabīja, etc., and the ultimate bliss of liberation, the essence of the three worlds, at the peak of the three worlds.

The Vajramadhya method is one where there are five fasts at the beginning and end, and the number of fasts decreases in the middle, leaving one point in the center. The number of points represents the number of fasts, and the number of spaces represents the number of breaking of fasts. The sequence is as follows: five fasts, one breaking of fast, four fasts, one breaking of fast, three fasts, one breaking of fast, two fasts, one breaking of fast, one fast, one breaking of fast, two fasts, one breaking of fast, three fasts, one breaking of fast, four fasts, one breaking of fast, and five fasts, one breaking of fast. This method involves twenty-nine fasts, nine breaking of fasts, and lasts for thirty-eight days. The fruit of this Vajramadhya method is the attainment of the position of Indra, Chakravarti, and Ganadhara, Avadhijnana, Manahparyaya Jnana, Prajnasraman Siddhi, and liberation.

The Mridangamadhya method is one where there are two to five points, and then four to two points. This method is characterized by a Mridanga-shaped expansion. The number of points represents the number of fasts, and the number of spaces represents the number of breaking of fasts. The sequence is as follows: two fasts, one breaking of fast, three fasts, one breaking of fast, four fasts, one breaking of fast, five fasts, one breaking of fast, four fasts, one breaking of fast, three fasts, one breaking of fast, and two fasts, one breaking of fast.

## Chapter Twenty-Four: 

**Verse 65:**  The **Ksheerasavitva**, **Akshinamhanas**, and other **riddhis** (divine powers), **avadhijnana** (knowledge of the past, present, and future), and finally **nirvana** (liberation) are the fruits of this **vrat** (vow).

**Verse 16:**  The **Mrujangamadhyavidhi** is a **yant** (diagram) with five to two dots, and two to five dots. The number of dots represents the number of **upavasas** (fasts), and the number of spaces represents the number of **paranas** (breaking of fasts).

**Verse 17:**  Where there are four **chaturthakas** (groups of four), there are twenty-four **upavasas**. This is called the **Ekaavali** method, and its fruit is **sukha** (happiness) in the **Ekaavali** state.

**Explanation:**

The **vrat** has twenty-three **upavasas** and seven **paranas**, and it is completed in thirty days. The fruits of this **vrat** are **Ksheerasavitva**, **Akshinamhanas**, and other **riddhis**, **avadhijnana**, and finally **nirvana**.

##  Chapter 426

**Verse 18:** The **Dvikavali** method, where there are forty-eight **upvasas** (fasts) and forty-eight **paranas** (breaking of fasts), is said to be **Dvikavali**. It brings happiness to both worlds.

**Verse 69:** The **Muktavali** method, where there are one to five and four to one **bindus** (dots), is known as **Muktavali**. It is known as **Muktavali** like a string of pearls.

**Verse 70:** The immediate result of this is that it adorns the person with the qualities of all beings, and in the end, it leads to the attainment of the **Siddhalaaya** (the abode of the liberated souls).

**Verse 71:** The **Ratnavali** method, where there are one to five and five to one **bindus**, is known as **Ratnavali**. Its result is the attainment of many qualities like a string of jewels.

**Explanation:**

**Dvikavali:** This method involves a pattern of two **bindus** (dots) representing one **upvasa** (fast) and one **parana** (breaking of fast). The total number of **bindus** is 98, which means 98 **upvasas** and 98 **paranas**. This method is said to bring happiness to both the physical and spiritual worlds.

**Muktavali:** This method involves a pattern of **bindus** that starts with one and increases to five, then decreases back to one. The total number of **bindus** is 25, which means 25 **upvasas** and 9 **paranas**. This method is said to be like a string of pearls, and it leads to the attainment of the **Siddhalaaya**.

**Ratnavali:** This method involves a pattern of **bindus** that starts with one and increases to five, then decreases back to one. The total number of **bindus** is 25, which means 25 **upvasas** and 10 **paranas**. This method is said to be like a string of jewels, and it leads to the attainment of many qualities.

**Note:** The terms **upvasa**, **parana**, **bindus**, **Dvikavali**, **Muktavali**, and **Ratnavali** are all Jain terms.

42nd Chapter
72. The Rupantaras (transformations) are fifteen in number, and the Rupantaras (transformations) at the beginning are sixteen. The Rupantaras are the inner forms, and the Mauktavali (garland of pearls) is indeed the foremost of jewels.

73. The Upavasa (fasts) to be counted here are two hundred and eighty-four, and the Bhukti (meals) are sixty-nine. The fruit is the attainment of the essence of the Ratnatraya (Three Jewels).

The Sardulавीडितम (tiger-sport) meter has one, two, and nine triplets, and then sixteen starting from one. These are calculated by the wise as thirty-four triplets. The Ratnamauktavali (garland of pearls) method is as follows: one should create a pattern where the numbers from one to fifteen are written with the difference of one between each, and then the numbers from sixteen to one are written with the difference of one decreasing each time.

In this vrata (observance), the total of all the numbers adds up to two hundred and eighty-four Upavasa (fasts) and sixty-nine Parana (breaking of the fast). The duration of this Upavasa is three hundred and forty-three days. The fruit of this is the attainment of the Ratnatraya (Three Jewels).

The Kanakaavali (garland of gold) method is as follows: one should write the number one, then the number two, then nine times the number three, then the numbers from one to sixteen, then thirty-four times the number three, then the numbers from sixteen to one, then nine times the number three, and finally the numbers one and two. This amounts to four hundred and thirty-four Upavasa (fasts) and eighty-eight Parana (breaking of the fast). The fruit of this vrata is the attainment of the position of the Lokaantika (celestial) deities or the final liberation from the cycle of rebirth.

The Ratnamauktaavali Yantra (diagram) and the Kanakaavali Yantra (diagram) are provided.

## Chapter 428

**Harivamsha Purana**

**Verse 7**

The sixteen and subsequent holes (randhra) are transformed into 'trika, dvika, karka, yatra-sha, kanaka-avali' which results in the attainment of 'lokantika-tva' (liberation).

**Verse 75**

When doubled, sixteen becomes thirty-two, then adding three, it becomes thirty-five. Adding four to thirty-five, it becomes thirty-nine. Then multiplying thirty-nine by two, it becomes seventy-eight. Adding eleven to seventy-eight, it becomes eighty-nine. Adding sixteen to eighty-nine, it becomes one hundred and five. Adding twenty-four to one hundred and five, it becomes one hundred and twenty-nine. Adding twelve to one hundred and twenty-nine, it becomes one hundred and forty-one. These five months are thus calculated in the scriptures.

**Verse 76**

One, two, three, four, two, one, added to sixteen, are to be known as thirty-two. Then adding two to thirty-two, it becomes thirty-four. Then adding two to thirty-four, it becomes thirty-six. These eight are known as 'dvika' (pairs). This is the 'ratna-avali' (jewel garland) method.

**Explanation**

Adding the number of 'dvika' (pairs) to fifty-six, which is three times seventy-four, we get one hundred and sixty-eight. Adding this to one hundred and sixty-eight, we get three hundred and thirty-six. This is the number of fasts. As there are eighty-eight 'sthana' (places), there are eighty-eight 'parana' (breaking of fast). This 'kanaka-avali' method takes one year, five months, and twelve days.

**Another method of 'ratna-avali'**

In this method, a garland of jewels is created. On the left side, two dots representing one 'bela' (period) are written as one 'dvika'. Then two dots representing two 'belas' are written as two 'dvika'. Similarly, three dots representing three 'belas' are written as three 'dvika', and four dots representing four 'belas' are written as four 'dvika'. After this, one dot representing one fast is written, followed by two dots representing two fasts, and so on, up to sixteen dots representing sixteen fasts. Then, on the right side, thirty-two 'dvika' representing thirty-two 'belas' are written in a circular manner, increasing in number. Below them, four 'dvika' representing four 'belas' are written. Above the thirty-two 'dvika', sixteen dots representing sixteen fasts, fifteen dots representing fifteen fasts, and so on, down to one dot representing one fast, are written in a row. Then, eight 'dvika' representing eight 'belas', three 'dvika' representing three 'belas', two 'dvika' representing two 'belas', and one 'dvika' representing one 'bela' are written. In this 'vrat' (fast), there are one hundred and twelve 'dvika' (pairs) which are twice the number of fifty-six 'dvika', and two hundred and seventy-two 'dvika' from both sides, making a total of three hundred and eighty-four fasts. There are eighty-eight 'sthana' (places) and eighty-eight 'bhucti-kala' (eating times). This 'vrat' is completed in one year, three months, and twenty-two days. It increases the brilliance of the 'ratna-tray' (three jewels), meaning it purifies the 'ratna-tray'.

**The method is as follows:**

One 'bela' (period) is followed by one 'parana' (breaking of fast). This continues until ten 'belas' are followed by ten 'paranas'. Then one fast is followed by one 'parana', two fasts are followed by one 'parana', three fasts are followed by one 'parana', and so on, until sixteen fasts are reached. Then one 'bela' is followed by one 'parana', and this continues until thirty 'belas' are followed by thirty 'paranas'. Then sixteen fasts are followed by one 'parana', fifteen fasts are followed by one 'parana', and so on, until one fast is followed by one 'parana'.

**Notes:**

1. 'Dvika' means a pair.
2. One, two, nine times three, one, two, three, and so on, up to sixteen. Then thirty-two fasts, then sixteen, fifteen, and so on, down to one. Then nine times fasts, then two, one. This is the 'kanaka-avali'.
3. 'Parana-divasa' is the day of breaking the fast.
4. The duration of the 'kanaka-avali' is one year, five months, and twelve days.
5. 'Giri' is a mountain.
6. 'Anta' means end.

## Harivamsha Purana, Anushtup

**Verse 78:**

Two, two, and one, these are auspicious, ending in five. Sixty, diminished on both sides, in the Lion's Play method.

**Verse 79:**

One, and up to eight, then nine again at the peak. In the middle, fasts should be fifty, a hundred in total.

**Explanation:**

**Lion's Play (Singhniskridit) Vrat:**

This vrat has three types: inferior (jghanya), medium (madhyama), and superior (utkrisht). The inferior Lion's Play vrat follows this pattern:

* Create a sequence where numbers one to five appear twice, increasing and decreasing by two each time.
* Repeat the sequence from five to one, again increasing and decreasing by two.
* The total number of digits represents the number of fasts, and the number of spaces represents the number of paranas (breaking of fast).

**Example:**

1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 3 2

1 1 4 3 5 4 5 5
1 1 1 1 1 1 4 5 3 4 2 3 1 2 1

**In this example:**

* You would fast once, then break your fast once.
* Then, you would fast twice, then break your fast once.
* This pattern continues, increasing and decreasing the number of fasts by one each time.

**The inferior Lion's Play vrat has a total of 60 fasts and 20 paranas, and it lasts for 80 days.**

**Medium Lion's Play Vrat:**

* Create a sequence from one to eight, with nine at the peak.
* Repeat the sequence from eight to one.
* Follow the same pattern of increasing and decreasing the number of fasts by one each time.

**The medium Lion's Play vrat has a total of 133 fasts and 33 paranas, and it lasts for 166 days.**

## Chapter Thirty-Four

**Verse 8:**

In the **Utkrishta Singhanishkridit** Vrat, one should create a sequence of numbers from one to fifteen, and write sixteen at the peak. Then, write the numbers from one to fifteen in reverse order. Here, as in the **Jghanya** and **Madhyama Singhanishkridit**, one should decrease or increase the number of fasts by one, instead of two, for each pair of numbers. The total number of fasts should be equal to the sum of all the numbers written, and the number of **Paranas** should be equal to the number of places. In this way, this Vrat has four hundred and ninety-nine fasts and sixty-one **Paranas**. This Vrat is completed in five hundred and fifty-seven days. Its sequence is as follows:

1 2 1 3 2 4 3 5 4 6 5 7 6 8 7 9 8 10 9 11 10 12 11
13 12 14 13 15 14 15 16 15 14 15 13 14 12 13
11 12 10 11 9 10 8 9 7 8 6 7 5 6 4 5 3 3 2 3 1 2 1

**Special Note:**

The meaning of verses 78, 79, and 80 can also be understood in a simple way. Scholars should consider this:

In the **Jghanya Singhanishkridit** method, write the numbers from one to five twice each, and then write the numbers from five to one twice each in reverse order. Adding all the numbers on both sides gives sixty fasts and twenty **Paranas**.

In the **Madhyama Singhanishkridit**, write the numbers from one to eight twice each, and write nine at the peak. Then, write the numbers from one to eight twice each in reverse order. Adding all the numbers gives one hundred and thirty-three fasts and thirty-three **Paranas**.

In the **Utkrishta Singhanishkridit**, write the numbers from one to fifteen twice each, and write sixteen at the peak. Then, write the numbers from one to fifteen twice each in reverse order. Adding all the numbers gives four hundred and ninety-nine fasts and sixty-one **Paranas**.

One should understand these sequences from this.

The concept in the Singh Nishkridit Vrat is that just as a lion ascends a mountain step by step, reaching its peak, and then descends step by step, similarly, a Muni Raj ascends the peak of the mountain of Tapa (austerity) by gradually increasing their fast, and then descends step by step.

## Chapter Thirty-Four

**Verse 8:**
Four *manosh* (units of time) for five *aryas* (days), sixty for eight, and fifteen for nine, with sixteen added for the *shikhar* (peak).

**Verse 8:**
Twenty *anushtup* (days), thirty-three, and sixty-one *paranas* (days of fasting). The *jghanya* (lowest), *madhyama* (middle), and *utkrista* (highest) *singha nishkridit* (lion play) vows are performed in sequence.

**Verse 8:**
This vow is like a diamond, with infinite strength, like a lion. The person who performs it will soon attain *siddhi* (liberation) with the power of *anima* (the ability to become small) and other *gunas* (qualities).

**Verse 4:**
The *harini* (deer) *chhandas* (meter) is used for the *dadhi mukha* (yogic practice) vow. There are four *dadhi mukha* in each direction of the *Nandi Shwar* (Nandi Shwar) island. There are eight *dadhi mukha* in total, where the *vasaras* (days) are nourished. There are six *dadhi mukha* in each direction, and the *janakas* (parents) are also included in this vow. This vow is the best, as it is performed by *Nandi Shwar*, the *jina chakra* (wheel of the Jinas).

**Verse 81:**
The author has also explained a simple method for counting the number of *singha nishkridit* vows and *paranas* of all three types. In the *jghanya singha nishkridit* vow, write down the numbers from one to five and add them together. Then multiply the sum by four. For example, the sum of the numbers from one to five is fifteen. Multiplying this by four gives us sixty, which is the number of fasting days. In the *madhyama singha nishkridit* vow, write down the numbers from one to eight and add them together. Then multiply the sum by four and add nine for the *shikhar*. For example, the sum of the numbers from one to eight is thirty-six. Multiplying this by four gives us one hundred and forty-four. Adding nine for the *shikhar* gives us one hundred and fifty-three, which is the number of fasting days. In the *utkrista singha nishkridit* vow, write down the numbers from one to fifteen and add them together. Then multiply the sum by four and add sixteen for the *shikhar*. For example, the sum of the numbers from one to fifteen is one hundred and twenty. Multiplying this by four gives us four hundred and eighty. Adding sixteen for the *shikhar* gives us four hundred and ninety-six, which is the number of fasting days.

**Verse 82:**
The *paranas* for the *jghanya*, *madhyama*, and *utkrista* *singha nishkridit* vows are twenty, thirty-three, and sixty-one respectively.

**Verse 83:**
As a result of this vow, the person becomes a holder of *vajra vashabha narach* (diamond, bull, and arrow) strength, fearless like a lion with infinite power, and endowed with *anima* and other *gunas*. They will soon attain *siddhi*.

**Nandi Shwar Vrat Vidhi:**
The *Nandi Shwar* vow is performed on the *Nandi Shwar* island, which has four *dadhi mukha* in each direction.

**Verse 85:**

The chariot-borne Meru mountains, in the sixth direction, are the abode of the gods. The fourth direction is the abode of the gods. The Meru-pankti-vrata will lead to great offerings.

**Verse 84:**

One should observe four fasts, aiming at the impurities of the mind, like the curds in the mouth. There are eight pleasure-givers in each direction, so one should observe eight fasts, aiming at each pleasure-giver. There is one Anjanagiri in each direction, so one should observe one bela, aiming at it. Thus, there are twelve fasts, one bela, and thirteen paranas in one direction. This vrata should be observed starting from the east, and then in the south, west, and north directions, in that order. There are forty-eight fasts, four belas, and fifty-two paranas in this vrata. Thus, this vrata is completed in one hundred and eight days. This Nandi-shwara vrata is very auspicious and is performed by the Jinas and the Chakravartis.

**Meru-pankti-vrata method:**

There are five Meru mountains in total: one in Jambudvipa, one in the eastern part of the Dhaataki-khand, one in the western part of the Dhaataki-khand, one in the eastern part of the Pushkara-ardha, and one in the western part of the Pushkara-ardha. Each Meru mountain has four forests: Bhadrashala, Nandana, Saumanasa, and Panduka. Each forest has four chaitya-alaya. In the Meru-pankti-vrata, one should observe belas, aiming at the forests.

## Chapter Thirty-Four: 

**Sub-Category:**

The sixth part of the sixty-four parts of the covering is adorned with the sixth part of the four-fourths. The **Vimana-Pankti** (Vimana-Row) method is the doer of this, the **Vimana-Pankti-Ishvara** (Lord of the Vimana-Row) is the doer of the feeling. || 86 ||

**Meru-Pankti Vrat (Meru-Row Vow):**

One must fast with the **Chaitya-alaya** (Shrine) as the target. In this way, in this vow, there are eighty fasts for the eighty **Chaitya-alaya** related to the five **Meru** and twenty **Vela** (Offering) for the twenty related to the forests, and there are one hundred **Parana** (Breaking of the fast) for those places. It takes two hundred and twenty days. The vow starts from the **Meru** of **Jambu-dvipa** (Jambu Continent). In it, first, there are four fasts, four **Parana** and one **Vela**, one **Parana** related to the forest for the four **Chaitya-alaya** of the **Bhadrashala** forest. Then, there are four fasts, four **Parana** and one **Vela**, one **Parana** related to the forest for the four **Chaitya-alaya** of the **Nandan** forest. Then, there are four fasts, four **Parana** and one **Vela**, one **Parana** related to the forest for the four **Chaitya-alaya** of the **Somanas** forest. After that, there are four fasts, four **Parana** and one **Vela**, one **Parana** related to the forest for the four **Chaitya-alaya** of the **Panduka** forest. In the same order, one should know the fasts, **Vela** and **Parana** related to the **Meru** of the east and west **Meha** of the **Dhataki-khanda** continent and the east and west **Meru** of the **Pushkarardham** continent. This **Meru-Pankti Vrat** grants the attainment of **Maha-abhisheka** (Great Consecration) on the **Meru** mountain, meaning the person who observes this vow becomes a **Tirthankara** (Liberated Soul). || 85 ||

**Vimana-Pankti Vrat (Vimana-Row Vow):**

**Vimana** (Aeronautical Vehicle) are of three types: **Indraka** (Central), **Shreni-bandha** (Row-bound) and **Prakirnaka** (Scattered). The **Indraka** **Vimana** is in the middle and the **Shreni-bandha** **Vimana** are situated in rows in all four directions. Starting from the **Ritu** **Vimana**, the number of **Indraka** **Vimana** is sixty-three. In the **Vimana-Pankti Vrat**, there are four fasts, four **Parana** for the **Shreni-bandha** **Vimana** in all four directions and one **Vela**, one **Parana** for the **Indraka**. In this way, there are two hundred and fifty-two fasts for the four rows of sixty-three **Indraka** **Vimana** and sixty-three **Vela** related to the sixty-three **Indraka**. After sixty-three **Vela**, there is one **Tela** (Oil). Thus, there are two hundred and fifty-two fasts, sixty-three **Vela** and one **Tela**, totaling three hundred and sixteen places, hence there are that many **Parana**. This vow is performed in the order of east, south, west and north directions. After four fasts in each direction, there is a **Vela**. It takes a total of six hundred and sixty-nine days. This vow grants the attainment of **Ishvarata** (Lordship) of the **Vimana**, meaning the person who performs this vow becomes the master of the **Vimana**. || 86 ||

**Vimana-Pankti Yantra (Vimana-Row Device):**

- **Shreni** (Row)
- **Lak's** (Lakh)

1. It is completed in 687 days. There are 316 places in it.
- 63 x 4 = 252 fasts

## Harivansh Purana:

**In the Harivansh Purana, it is said that where the form of the chariot is described, there are five, and then three, and from that, the form also becomes three. Thus, the Shatakumbha method is of three types: inferior, medium, and superior.**

**Inferior Shatakumbha Method:**

* Create a chart with numbers from one to five, written in descending order: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
* Then, excluding the first number (5), write the remaining numbers (4, 3, 2, 1) three times in descending order.
* The total sum of all the numbers represents the number of fasts, and the number of spaces represents the number of paranas (breaking of fast).
* This method has 45 fasts and 17 paranas, and it is completed in 62 days.
* The chart looks like this:
    5 4 3 2 1 4 3 2 1 4 3 2 1 4 3 2 1

**Medium Shatakumbha Method:**

* Create a chart with numbers from one to nine, written in descending order: 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
* Then, excluding the first number (9), write the remaining numbers (8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) three times in descending order.
* The total sum of all the numbers represents the number of fasts, and the number of spaces represents the number of paranas.

**Kaval 1 Fast**

**Arya**
These rules, beginning with Ekadashi and ending with Shatakumbha, are prescribed. They are also classified as first, middle, and excellent, ending with fifteen, nine, and sixteen. || 88 || Upjati Vrittam
As stated, the number of fasts for those who are unable to follow the rules of these austerities is as follows: according to one's own strength, those who are inclined towards their own benefit can also complete the prescribed number of fasts by means of fasts, belās, and telās. || 89 || Sragdhara
He who fasts on the Amavasya, eats only one kaval on the Pratipada, and increases his food intake on the Purnima, rejoicing in the good fortune of the full moon, is a true devotee. This is the natural fast, which sinks into the austerity, following the course of the moon. 

**Kaval 2**
**Chandrayana Vidhi** - The Chandrayana Vrat is performed according to the beautiful movement of the moon. The one who performs this Vrat fasts on the Amavasya, then eats one kaval - one morsel of food - on the Pratipada. Thereafter, he increases his food intake by one morsel each day, until he eats fourteen kavals on the Chaturdashi. He fasts on the Purnima, then, according to the phases of the moon...

Harivamsha Purana
The food of the Kavala, which is increased by one each day, starting with fasting on the first day and ending with seven Kavalas on the eighth day, and then decreasing by one each day until fasting on the last day, is to be performed for seven weeks. This is the Sapta-Saptama Tapa-Vidhi. ||11||
The Ashta-Ashtama, Nava-Navama, Dasha-Dashama, Ekadasha-Ekadasha, and Dvadasha-Dvadasha, etc., up to the Dvatrimsha-Dvatrimsha, are to be performed in the same way as the Sapta-Saptama Tapa-Vidhi. In each of these, the first day is a fast, and then the number of Kavalas is increased by one each day until the number of the Vidhi is reached. Then the number of Kavalas is decreased by one each day until one Kavala is reached, and the last day is a fast. The natural food of a human being is said to be thirty-two Kavalas, so this Vrata is limited to thirty-two Kavalas. ||12||
Another way to perform the Sapta-Saptama Tapa-Vidhi is to eat one Kavala on the first day, two Kavalas on the second day, three Kavalas on the third day, and so on, until seven Kavalas are eaten on the seventh day. This cycle is then repeated seven times. ||13||
The Ashta-Ashtama, etc., are to be performed in the same way, starting with a fast on the first day and increasing the number of Kavalas by one each day. ||14||
In the Achaamla-Vardhamana Vidhi, the first day is a fast, the second day one meal, the third day two meals, and so on, until the eleventh day, when ten meals are eaten. Then the number of meals is decreased by one each day until the tenth day, when one meal is eaten, and the last day is a fast. In the first ten days of this Vrata, Nirvikruti (bland) food should be eaten, and in the last ten days, the first food served should be eaten. ||15||
The first day is a fast, then the number of Kavalas is increased by one each day until the eighth day, when seven Kavalas are eaten, then the number of Kavalas is decreased by one each day until the last day, which is a fast. This is to be done for seven weeks. ||16||

* **Shardaulvikridita:**  There are 8 **Upavasa** (fasts) for each of the 8 **Upjati** (sub-categories) of **Darshan Shuddhi**, each requiring the 8 **Gunas** (qualities) starting with **Nishankit**. 
* **Shardaulvikridita:**  There are 24 fasts in total for the 3 **Samyagdarshanas** (right views) of **Darshan Shuddhi**. Each fast is followed by a **Parana**, making a total of 48 days for this fast.

**Note:** The text mentions that some people consider 12 **Paranas** for the 78 fasts of **Tap Shuddhi**, but this interpretation is not accurate as it makes the word "Pruthak" (separate) meaningless and makes it extremely difficult to perform 30 fasts consecutively after a **Parana**.

**The practice of removing suffering (Dukhaharan Vidhi):**

In the practice of removing suffering, the learned should first observe fourteen fasts, considering the lowest and highest lifespans of the seven realms. ||117||

Then, considering the two lifespans of the beings in the animal realm, both those who have attained perfection and those who have not, one should observe four fasts. After that, considering the two lifespans of the beings in the human realm, both those who have attained perfection and those who have not, one should observe four fasts. Then, in the realm of gods, one should observe two fasts for the gods up to the Aishana heaven, twenty-two fasts for the gods up to the Achyuta heaven, eighteen fasts for the nine graveyakas, two fasts for the nine anudishas, and two fasts for the five anuttara vimanas. In total, one should observe sixty-eight fasts. In this practice, one breaks the fast after two fasts.

## Chapter Thirty-Four

**The **Jina Guna Sampatti** Vrat**

**Verse 122:**
The **Jina Guna Sampatti** Vrat consists of five **Kalyaṇakas** (auspicious acts), thirty-four **Atiśayas** (superhuman powers), eight **Prātihāryas** (miracles), and sixteen **Kāraṇa-bhāvanās** (motivations). These are to be observed as **Upavāsa** (fasts) and **Pāraṇā** (breaking of fasts) in the following manner: five **Upavāsa** for the five **Kalyaṇakas**, thirty-four **Upavāsa** for the thirty-four **Atiśayas**, eight **Upavāsa** for the eight **Prātihāryas**, and sixteen **Upavāsa** for the sixteen **Kāraṇa-bhāvanās**. After each **Upavāsa**, a **Pāraṇā** is to be performed. This vrat is completed in one hundred and twenty-six days. By observing this vrat, one attains the qualities of the **Jina** (liberated being) and becomes a **Tīrthaṅkara** (spiritual leader).

**The **Divya Lakṣaṇa Paṅkti** Vrat**

**Verse 123:**
The **Divya Lakṣaṇa Paṅkti** Vrat consists of thirty-two **Vyanjana** (ingredients), sixty-four **Kalā** (arts), and one hundred and eight **Lakṣaṇa** (characteristics), totaling two hundred and four **Lakṣaṇa**. This vrat requires two hundred and four **Upavāsa** and **Pāraṇā**. Each **Upavāsa** is followed by a **Pāraṇā**, making a total of four hundred and eight days for the completion of this vrat. By observing this vrat, the individual becomes extremely great and manifests a series of excellent **Divya Lakṣaṇa** (divine characteristics).

**The **Dharmachakra** Vrat**

The **Dharmachakra** Vrat consists of one thousand **Arā** (cycles). Each **Arā** requires one **Upavāsa**, making a total of one thousand **Upavāsa**. Since there are one thousand **Arā**, there are also one thousand **Pāraṇā**. Therefore, the total number of **Upavāsa** and **Pāraṇā** in this vrat is two thousand. This vrat should be observed with one **Upavāsa** followed by one **Pāraṇā**, and so on. It is essential to perform one **Velā** (meal) at the beginning and one **Velā** at the end of this vrat. This vrat is completed in two thousand and four days and leads to the attainment of the **Dharmachakra** (wheel of righteousness).

**The **Paraspara Kalyāṇa** Vrat**

The **Paraspara Kalyāṇa** Vrat consists of five **Upavāsa** for the five **Kalyaṇakas**, eight **Upavāsa** for the eight **Prātihāryas**, and thirty-four **Upavāsa** for the thirty-four **Atiśayas**, totaling forty-seven **Upavāsa**. These forty-seven **Upavāsa** are to be counted twenty-four times, resulting in eleven hundred and twenty-eight **Upavāsa**. Since there are eleven hundred and twenty-eight **Upavāsa**, there are also eleven hundred and twenty-eight **Pāraṇā**. Therefore, the total number of **Upavāsa** and **Pāraṇā** in this vrat is two thousand two hundred and fifty-six. This vrat should be observed with one **Upavāsa** followed by one **Pāraṇā**, and so on. It is completed in two thousand two hundred and fifty-six days. One **Velā** is to be performed at the beginning and one **Velā** at the end of this vrat. This vrat brings about the welfare of the individual who observes it.

**Note:**
1. The verse describing the **Dharmachakra** Vrat is not available in the copies we have, but it is mentioned in the translation by **Thoman** and **Sw. Pan. Gajadharlalji**. Therefore, it is likely that the verse was present in the copies they had access to. We have included the description of this vrat based on their translation.

2. The description of the **Paraspara Kalyāṇa** Vrat is also based on the translation by **Pan. Gajadharlalji**. The translation of the line "**Ādau ṣaṣṭhopavāsah syāt samāptāv aṣṭamastathā**" in his translation goes beyond the description of this vrat and has been included here.

In the Harivamsha Purana, this is a demonstration of all the rules. One should understand that where the word "chaturthaka" is used, it refers to one fast, where "shashtha" is used, it refers to two fasts, and where "ashtama" is used, it refers to three fasts. Similarly, one should know the names of the fasts from the tenth to the sixth month. ||25||
Fasts should be performed on the tithis from pratipada to panchadashi. These fasts are of many types and are said to be endowed with all kinds of happiness in the Jain path. ||126||
One should fast on the seventh day of the bright fortnight of Bhadrapada. This is called the Parinirvana vidhi and it gives the fruit of infinite happiness. ||127||
Fasting on the eleventh day of the bright fortnight of Bhadrapada is called the Pratiharaya Prasiddhi vidhi and it bears fruit for the duration of palya. The eighty-six fasts performed on the eleventh day of the dark fortnight of each month produce infinite happiness. ||128||
Fasting on the third day of the bright fortnight of Margashirsha is called the Anantakrut vidhi and it gives the fruit of infinite liberation. Performing vela on the fourth day of the same month is called the Vimana Pankti Virajya vidhi and it results in the attainment of the kingdom of the rows of vimanas. ||129||
Humans should perform these rules as much as possible, because they are the causes of happiness in heaven and liberation, both directly and through tradition. ||130|| Hai ||124||

## Chapter Thirty-Four

Thus, the well-established ascetic, following the prescribed method, bound the karma of the Tirthankara name with sixteen pure causes. || 131 ||

The faith that is free from doubt and possesses eight qualities, as described by the Jinas, in the path of liberation, is called **darshan-vishuddhi**. This is the first cause for the binding of the Tirthankara nature. || 132 ||

The great respect for knowledge and its possessors, which eliminates the passions, is the second cause for the binding of the Tirthankara nature, called **vinaya-sampannata**. || 133 ||

The impeccable conduct of body, speech, and mind in the protection of the vows is known as **shuddha-sheelavrata-anatichar** and should be understood by those who are dedicated to the path. || 134 ||

The constant application of knowledge, which is characterized by direct and indirect perception and bears the fruit of the elimination of ignorance, is called **abhikshnan-jnana-upayoga**. || 135 ||

Fear of the world, which is burdened with the weight of birth, old age, death, and the accumulation of physical and mental suffering, is the **samvega** that cuts off the thirst for worldly objects. || 136 ||

Giving food, protection, and knowledge, which removes the suffering of the day and the cycle of existence, is called **tyaga**. || 137 ||

The effort of a man who does not hide his knowledge, whose body is like a decaying, impure, and dead corpse, and who is dedicated to the path of liberation, is called **tapa**. || 138 ||

The protection of the tapas of the virtuous, like extinguishing a fire in a storehouse, by destroying incoming obstacles, is called **sadhu-samadhi**. || 139 ||

The activity of removing the suffering caused by hunger, thirst, and disease from virtuous people is called **vaivya-vritti** by means of **vasu-dravya**. || 140 ||

And the causes of happiness related to liberation are... || 130 ||

## Chapter 446 of the Harivamsha Purana:

**141.** The devotion to the Arhats, the devotion to the Acharyas, the devotion to the Bahushruta, and the humility in the sermons, these four are called Arhat Bhakti, Acharya Bhakti, Bahushruta Bhakti, and Pravachan Bhakti respectively.

**142.** The practice of the six essential actions, Samayika and others, at their designated times, is called the Avasyaka Parihani.

**143.** The Samayika is the state of mind where one abandons all the Saavady Yogas and fixes the mind on one object. The recitation of the virtues of the twenty-four Tirthankaras is called Stuti.

**144.** The practices where two Asanas, twelve Nirdosha Avarta, and four Shironatis are performed are called Vandaniya Vandana by the wise.

**145.** The removal of the mistakes committed in Dravya, Kshetra, Kala, and Bhava, through the purification of the mind, speech, and body, is called Pratikramana.

**146.** The rejection of the incoming faults is called Pratiakhyana. And the renunciation of attachment to the body for a definite period is called Kayotsarga.

**147.** The illumination of the path of liberation in the world through the knowledge capable of refuting other doctrines, the practice of austerities, and the great worship of the Jina, is called Marg Prabhavna.

**148.** The affection of a person with a keen intellect towards his fellow-religionist, like the affection of a cow for her calf, is called Pravachan Vatsalya, because the affection for a fellow-religionist is born out of the sermons.

**149.** These sixteen aforementioned practices, contemplated by the virtuous, individually or collectively, are the causes of the bondage of the Tirthankara Karma.

## Chapter Forty-Four: The Great Fast

**Verse 150:** The highly esteemed Muni, bound by the great merit of the Tirthankara nature, capable of shaking the seats of the three realms, renounced a month's food. He then, with a pure mind, diligently performed the four types of worship praised by the wise, and thus, being the sustainer of twenty-two Sagaras, he was born in the Jayanta heaven, a vast realm of happiness.

**Verse 151:** Having attained the three omniscient eyes, and thus seeing the state of the three realms, this highly esteemed Muni, worthy of the Ahmindras, will enjoy the unparalleled happiness of the essence of Samsara in the Jayanta heaven. He will then be born as the twenty-second Tirthankara, Nemishvara, the jewel of the Harivansha mountain, the auspicious one, from the queen Shiva, the wife of King Samudravijaya.

Thus ends the forty-fourth chapter of the Harivansha Purana, composed by Jinaseanacharya, which is a collection of the Arishta-Nemipuraana, and describes the method of the great fast.

## Chapter Thirty-Five

Hearing the story of Arishta-nemi from the Ati-mukta-karshi Muni, Yadu, the श्रेणिक, was overjoyed. He bowed to the Muni and, accompanied by his wife, went home. ||1||

As before, the couple, who were deeply attached to pleasures, indulged in their favorite pastimes in Mathurapuri. The king Kansa, fearing their death, constantly served them. ||2||

Then, Devaki conceived twins, the cause of Kansa's fear. For, the mutual support of enemies brings about great fear for the enemy. ||3||

When the time for delivery arrived, the twins were born. By the command of Indra, the god Sanai-gam took the twins and brought them to the house of Sudrishti, the merchant of Subhadil, where his wife, Alaka (the previous birth of Revati's nurse), had also given birth to twins. However, due to fate, those twins died immediately after birth. Sanai-gam took the dead twins and placed them in Devaki's delivery room, then returned to his heavenly abode. ||4-5||

Kansa, filled with suspicion, entered his sister's delivery room and saw the two dead infants. Like a fierce Bhil, he grabbed them by their feet and smashed them against a stone. ||6||

Later, Devaki gave birth to two more pairs of twins. The god took them to Alaka, the merchant's wife, who longed for children. The wicked Kansa, again, smashed those lifeless infants against the stone, as before. ||7||

Then, the sons of Vasudeva, protected by their own merit, who were destined to be known by specific names, were raised by Alaka with great care. They gradually grew up, becoming very beautiful. ||8||

## Chapter Fifty-Three

As the sons of Vasudeva grew, Sudrishti Seth's wealth and prosperity increased, surpassing even the wealth of other kings. Devaki, freed from the sorrow of childlessness by her husband's words, gradually regained her former radiance, like the moon waxing in its phases.

One night, as Devaki lay in her bed, as white as the moon, she saw seven auspicious omens in her dreams. First, she saw the rising sun, dispelling darkness. Then, she saw the full moon, shining brightly. Next, she saw Lakshmi, being crowned by the elephants. Then, she saw a celestial chariot descending from the sky. After that, she saw a great fire with blazing flames. Then, she saw a divine flag adorned with jewels, high in the sky. Finally, she saw a lion entering her mouth. 

Startled by these dreams, Devaki woke up trembling. Filled with wonder and excitement, she recounted her dreams to her husband, the wise Vasudeva, as soon as the morning arrived. He interpreted the dreams, saying:

"My dear, you will soon have a son who will rule the entire earth. The rising sun in your dream signifies that he will destroy his enemies with his power. The full moon signifies that he will be beloved by all. The Lakshmi being crowned by elephants signifies that he will be prosperous. The celestial chariot descending from the sky signifies that he will be a great king. The blazing fire signifies that he will be powerful. The divine flag signifies that he will be victorious. And the lion entering your mouth signifies that he will be brave and fearless."

Harivamsha Purana
Hearing the interpretation of her dreams from her husband, she was filled with joy and said, "So be it!"  Just as the sky, for the sake of the world's peace, holds the rain-bearing clouds, so too did she quickly conceive a child for the benefit of the world. ||16|| As her body and mind grew in happiness, so too did the joy of all beings on earth increase with the growth of her womb. ||17|| Kamsa, consumed by anxiety, guarded the womb, waiting for the birth, his soul base, not caring for the qualities of the child, and counting the days and months without any regard. ||18|| Though all children are born in nine months, Krishna was born in the seventh month, on the twelfth day of the bright fortnight of Bhadrapada, in the Shravana constellation, unseen and unobserved. ||19|| Krishna, whose body was adorned with the auspicious marks of the conch, discus, etc., and whose body radiated a brilliant blue light like a precious gem, illuminated Devaki's delivery room with his radiance. ||20|| At that time, due to the influence of that Supreme Being, auspicious signs appeared in the homes of his friends and relatives, while fearful omens appeared in the homes of his enemies. ||21|| Even though there was a heavy downpour for seven days, as soon as Krishna was born, Balarama picked him up, and Vasudeva held a canopy over him, and they both left the house that very night. ||22|| 
In her dream, she saw Lakshmi being crowned by elephants, which indicated that he would be very fortunate and crowned king. In her fourth dream, she saw a flying chariot descending from the sky, which revealed that he would be born from heaven. In her fifth dream, she saw a blazing fire, which indicated that he would be very radiant. In her sixth dream, she saw the flags of the gods adorned with jewels, which indicated that he would be steadfast in nature. And in her seventh dream, she saw a lion entering her mouth, which indicated that he would be fearless. ||15||

The city was asleep, the guards of Kamsa were asleep, and the city was asleep.  They escaped through the gate of the city, the doors of which opened at the touch of Vishnu's feet.  ||23||
A drop of milk entered the baby's nose, and he sneezed.  The sound of the sneeze was like the sound of lightning and wind.  From above, a voice said, "May you live long and prosper."  ||24||
King Ugrasena, Kamsa's father, was above the gate.  He had given the blessing.  Balarama and Vasudeva were delighted to hear this blessing and said to Ugrasena, "O revered one, keep this secret.  You will be freed from this son of Devaki."  ||25||
Ugrasena agreed, saying, "Let this son of my brother's wife grow up in secret.  He is destined to be great."  Then, praising Ugrasena's words, they quickly left the city.  ||26||
A bull with blazing horns led the way, illuminating the path.  The mighty Yamuna flowed, but its great current was broken by the power of Krishna.  ||27||
They crossed the river and went to Vrindavan.  There, outside the village, in a cowherd's hut, lived a cowherd named Sunanda, with his wife Yashoda.  He was a trusted friend of the family, and they had known him for generations.  Balarama and Vasudeva saw him at night and gave him the baby, saying, "Brother, this child has large eyes and his eyes are like a fountain of nectar.  Raise him as your own son, and keep this secret from everyone."  ||28-29||
Then, they took the daughter of Yashoda, who had been born at the same time, and returned quickly.  They gave her to Queen Devaki to convince the enemy, and they hid themselves.  ||30||

452
In the Harivamsha Purana
Kansa, the cruel one, entered the birthing chamber after learning of his sister's delivery. Seeing the innocent child, the husband of the deceased (Devaki) once thought that this child might be his enemy. 31 Troubled by doubt, he became free from anger and the far-sighted one himself took the child and flattened her nose with his hand. 32 He, the tormentor of Devaki's mind, the seer of her sons, remained satisfied for some days, his fierce nature hidden. 33 Then, the one who had his birth rites performed, named Krishna, grew up in Vraja, increasing the unprecedented joy of Nanda and Yashoda. 34 With his hands bearing the auspicious marks of the mace, discus, arrow, conch and lotus, he captivated the minds of the cowherd boys and girls, reclining at ease. 35 The beautiful one, resplendent like the blue lotus, the object of the description of the gift of breasts, the proud one with full breasts - the unsatisfied ones drank him in with single-pointed attention. 36 Once, Kansa was told by the omen-knowing Varuna, the well-wisher: "O king, search for your enemy, who is somewhere in the city or the forest." 37 Then, Kansa, with the intention of destroying the enemy, observed a three-day fast. The deities approached him, saying: "The deities satisfied by your past austerities, tell us what is to be done. Who is the enemy of Kansa that is to be destroyed immediately?" 38-39

## Chapter Thirty-Five

Someone, my enemy, is growing somewhere unseen. Quickly, you, without any compassion, find him and put him in the jaws of death. ||40||

Having accepted this, the goddesses departed. One of them, quickly assuming the form of a fierce bird, attacked the child Krishna with her beak. But Krishna, grabbing her beak, squeezed so hard that she, terrified, fled with a loud shriek. ||41||

Another goddess, assuming the form of a Putana, a demoness, approached and tried to feed him her poisoned breast. But Krishna, being protected by the gods, had a very hard mouth. He sucked so hard on the tip of her breast that she cried out in pain. ||42||

The child Krishna sometimes slept, sometimes sat, sometimes crawled on his chest, sometimes walked with stumbling feet, sometimes ran around, sometimes sang sweetly, and sometimes spent his days and nights eating butter. ||43||

A third demoness, assuming the form of a chariot, came before them. But Krishna, though a child, was fearless, radiant like the Anjanagiri mountain, and a man destined for great achievements. He kicked her hard and destroyed her. ||44||

One day, due to excessive mischief, Yashoda tied Krishna's foot to a mortar with a rope. On that same day, two enemy goddesses, Jamala and Arjuna, assuming the form of trees, tried to torment him. But even in that situation, Krishna threw them down and drove them away. ||45||

In the beginning of his auspicious childhood, Sunanda Gop and Yashoda, seeing his wondrous power, were amazed and praised him. That wonderful, charming child grew up in the forest. ||46||

One day, seeing a herd of cows being driven by a cowherd, he saw a fierce sound coming from the other side. He, with a strong throat, killed the sound that was like a vast ocean filling up. ||47||

We are all goddesses who have attained perfection through our past austerities. Tell us what you want. Except for Balabhadra and Narayana, tell us which enemy of Kansa can be destroyed in an instant. ||38-39||

Kansa said, "There is an enemy of mine who is growing somewhere in secret. You, without any compassion, quickly find him and put him in the jaws of death - kill him." ||40||

In the Harivamsha Purana, the demon, in the form of a stone bull, tormented the Gokula. Krishna, the bearer of the beautiful throat, lifted the Govardhan mountain high above his head, protecting everyone beneath it. ||48||

Hearing of Krishna's extraordinary feat, Balarama, the son of Devaki, went to Gokula, under the pretext of having observed a fast, to see his brother. ||49||

He saw the beautiful-throated Gopalas, their faces adorned with garlands, and the cattle, adorned with bells, in the forest, on the branches of the mountain. He was filled with supreme joy. ||50||

The forest was filled with cows of a beautiful, dark, smooth color, like Krishna's, and others, white like Balarama. Seeing this, Devaki was overjoyed, for the sight of her son's likeness was a source of joy. ||51||

She saw the cows, content with grass and water, their calves suckling, being milked by the Gopalas, their udders large like pots. Seeing these beautiful cows in the cowshed, Devaki's hair stood on end, and she was filled with joy. ||52||

At that time, the sound of the cows mooing with their calves, and the sound of the Gopis churning butter, filled the air. Devaki's heart was filled with joy, for what cannot be overcome by a deep sound? ||53||

Then, Nanda, filled with joy, went to Devaki, along with Yashoda, and, with a group of people, bowed to the glorious Devaki with devotion. ||54||

The sixth day, the demon came in the form of a bull. He was arrogant, roaming everywhere in the Gokula, making a loud noise, and appearing like the ocean, drowning everything. But Krishna, the bearer of the beautiful throat, twisted his neck and destroyed him. ||47||

The seventh day, the demon tried to kill Krishna with a stone rain. But Krishna was not disturbed by it. Instead, he lifted the Govardhan mountain high above his head with his strong arms, protecting the Gokula from the rain. ||48||

The one wearing a pair of yellow garments, adorned with a peacock feather garland in the forest, with an unbroken blue lotus garland on his head, with a beautiful conch-like neck decorated with an excellent necklace ॥55॥ - with golden earrings shining brilliantly, with a crown of forest flowers on his head, with shining golden bracelets on his arms, accompanied by many beautiful cowherd boys, and endowed with fame and compassion - that son was brought by Yaśodā and made to bow at the feet of Devakī. Seated near, the one dressed as a cowherd ॥56-57॥ Devakī said, "O famous Yaśodā! Even in the forest, your dwelling is praiseworthy, for in this world, one without a son, no matter how much kingdom he may obtain, is not satisfied." ॥58॥ The cowherd woman Yaśodā replied, "What you have said, O mistress, is true. May this eternal servant thrive forever by your loving blessings." ॥59॥
In the meantime, seeing the son, Devakī's breasts became abundantly filled with milk. She was unable to restrain the flowing [milk], for there can be no concealment when the heart is divided. ॥60॥ Then, as if displaying the purity of her heart, saying, "O son, you are separated from me not due to evil intentions, but out of fear of the enemy," the streams of milk from her breasts shone forth. ॥61॥ Suddenly, the wise Balarāma, skilled with the milk pot, himself performed the consecration, pouring the milk over the anointed one, for the accomplished are never bewildered in opportune actions. ॥62॥

Here is the English translation, preserving the Jain terms:

After obtaining the happiness of seeing Hari, Balarama brought the sadhvi (virtuous lady) Devaki and entered Mathura again. He then conveyed the entire account to his father Vasudeva. 

From his childhood, Balarama diligently taught various arts and qualities to Keshava. The steady instructions never went in vain for the humble disciple, as the preceptor's teachings did not waste time.

That kumara (young boy) Krishna, with a very tender heart, in the ecstasy of youth, would embrace the gopa-kanyas (cowherd girls) during the rasa-lila (divine dance). He would create the bliss of touch of his fingers for the community of gopa-vadhu (cowherd women), but remained himself utterly detached, like a precious gem set in a ring.

Just as Hari's love for the multitude increased greatly in their hearts, similarly, the love of separation also grew in the hearts of those distressed by separation during his lilas (divine plays).

Suspecting him to be an enemy, Kamsa once entered Vraja to search for him. But Devaki's son Achyuta (infallible Krishna) was sent away from there by his mother.

There, a fierce rakshasi (demoness) named Putana appeared, with loud laughter, her eyes and face extremely harsh, and her body greatly distorted. Seeing her, the transcendental Lord (Adhokshaja) killed her with his divine weapon.

Chapter Thirty-Five: The Mandap of the Shalmali Tree

The group of pillars, too heavy for others to lift, were easily lifted and placed by Krishna. Seeing this, his mother, relieved, brought him back to Vrindavan. ||7||

Kamsa, the wicked and pleasure-seeking, returned to Mathura when he couldn't find Krishna in Gokul. At that time, a serpent-bed with a lion as its mount, the Ajit-Janaya bow, and the Panchajanya conch appeared in his palace. Kamsa's astrologer told him, "Whoever mounts the serpent-bed, strings the Ajit-Janaya bow, and blows the Panchajanya conch is your enemy." Following the astrologer's advice, Kamsa, seeking his enemy, had his people announce in the city, "Whoever comes here, mounts the serpent-bed with a lion as its mount, strings the Ajit-Janaya bow, and blows the Panchajanya conch will be considered the best among men, a conqueror of all, and will be greatly pleased by Kamsa, who knows the hearts of men. He will be considered a friend and will be given invaluable gifts." ||1, 71-73||

Hearing this proclamation, many kings came to Mathura and attempted to perform the actions, but they all became fearful and ashamed and left. ||74||

One day, Bhanu, the brother of Kamsa's wife, Jivadhya, went to Gokul. Seeing Krishna's extraordinary prowess, he was very pleased and brought him to Mathura. ||75||

Krishna, seeing the serpent-bed, which was adorned with great splendor, had a moon-like back, and was adorned with the hoods of fearsome serpents, quickly mounted it as if it were his own bed. ||76||

Page #496:
---------------------------
458
In the Harivamsha Purana, he then strung the bow, scattering the smoke exhaled by the serpents. He filled the conch, effortlessly and without hesitation, with sounds that filled all directions. ||77|| Seeing Krishna's extraordinary and transcendental greatness, all the people exclaimed, "Oh, what a great man this is, whose voice is like the roar of a churning sea!" ||78|| Seeing Krishna's prowess, Balarama, his elder brother, was filled with fear of the wicked Kamsa. Therefore, he sent Krishna, the great devotee, to Vrindavan, along with his close companions, who were deeply attached to his virtues. ||79|| 
Meaning: Balarama, fearing Kamsa, did not let Krishna go alone, but said, "He is very virtuous, so all of you go and send him." He sent many of his own people along with him. ||79||
Gautama Swami says, what can a proud enemy do to a man who has attained excellence through the Jain Dharma, obtained in a previous birth? Even if he harbors hatred in his heart from before conception and birth. ||80||
Thus ends the thirty-fifth chapter of the Harivamsha Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which is part of the Arishta-nemi Purana collection, and describes the childhood games of Krishna. ||35||

## Chapter Thirty-Six

**Mālini Chanda**

Then, on the arrow-seat (Bāṇāsana) adorned with a buzzing bee-like chariot, resting on a bed of swans and the sound of their cries, in the autumn season, which destroys the pride and wings of the enemy peacocks, and is adorned with the playful activities of the new Lakshmi of Hari, it appeared as if...

**1.**  The moon, having dispelled the clouds, shone brightly, as if it were the giver of wealth. The earth, with its abundant grass, was free of mud, as if it were anticipating the laughter of Krishna, which would soon be revealed due to the imminent destruction of the powerful Kamsa.

**2.** The clear rivers, with their abundant foam, were like the white lotuses in the natural lakes filled with water. The mountains, with their white flowers in their forests, seemed to be adorned with the white glory of Hari.

**3.** The fertile earth, adorned with the abundant rice crop, was like a beautiful woman, burdened by the weight of her breasts, and eager for the embrace of the new king, Krishna.

**4.** The loud cries of the cows and bulls, excited by the burden of their offspring and the joy of the season of conception, seemed to be nourishing the heart of Vishnu, as if they were announcing the destruction of his enemies.

**5.** Kamsa, though aware of Krishna's intentions, still sent his entire group of cowherds to the Yamuna river to fetch lotuses, hoping to find a way to destroy him. He sent them to the difficult-to-reach, muddy banks of the Yamuna, hoping to find a way to harm Krishna.

Page #498:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, Krishna, adorned with the strength of his own arms, effortlessly entered the lake, where venomous snakes slithered. He swiftly crushed the mighty Kaliya, who was enraged and whose hood, adorned with gems, emitted sparks like fire, making him appear extremely dark.  ||7||

Krishna, whose body was thrilled and delighted by the cheers of the Gopas, who had climbed the branches of the trees on the shore, and by the deep voice of Balabhadra, returned to the shore, swiftly like the wind, after slaying the serpent Kaliya, and plucking lotuses. ||8||

As Krishna, adorned with a shining yellow garment, emerged from the lake, Balabhadra, overwhelmed with joy, embraced him tightly with his blue garment. At that time, Krishna, adorned with a yellow garment, embraced by Balabhadra, who wore a blue garment, appeared like a dark cloud with lightning, embracing black and white rocks. ||9||

Kamsa, who could not tolerate the virtues of others, saw the lotuses offered by the Gopas and breathed heavily with anger. He immediately commanded, "Let Nanda's son and all the Gopas be ready for a wrestling match without delay." ||10||

Thus, having given a strict order for a wrestling match, Kamsa, whose mind was sharp like a discus and a mace, desired to engage in a wrestling match. He immediately summoned all the strong wrestlers, both young and old, and those of medium strength. ||11||

Vasudeva, who possessed a steady mind, along with his son, who was born during a drought, immediately understood the enemy's intentions. He quickly sent word to all his elder brothers, informing them of the situation and urging them to come to Mathura without delay. ||12||

Vasudeva's nine elder brothers, who knew the enemy's intentions, adorned with chariots, horses, and foot soldiers, marched towards the battlefield, decorating the ground with their army, their deceitful hearts filled with malice. ||13||

**461**

Seeing the Yadava kings, who had come to Mathura to see their long-separated brother, Vasudeva, under the guise of a visit, Kansa, filled with suspicion, greeted them with a forced smile and bowed low. He then escorted them into the city.  

Their eyes were filled with delight at the sight of the magnificent houses of Mathura. They were given the best accommodations by Kansa, the king of the city. They stayed in Mathura, and Kansa served them daily with gifts, respect, and salutations. Though they outwardly pretended to be filled with love, they harbored a burning fire within.

Balabhadra, who had understood the entire plan, whose body was as white as a bull, who was extremely wise, and whose intellect was highly skilled, desired to arouse the desire for battle in Krishna's heart. He said to Yashoda, in front of Gokula, "Hurry up and bathe."

"Why are you delaying? You are so lost in your own body that you have forgotten yourself. I have told you many times, but you still haven't changed your ways. Just like the ocean, which produces beautiful pearls from pure and auspicious oysters, doesn't abandon its fickleness, you too..."

Balabhadra had never spoken such harsh words to Yashoda, even though they had lived together for a long time. She was shocked and frightened. Though she didn't say anything, tears welled up in her eyes. She silently hurried to prepare for bathing and cooking, doing what was necessary. Krishna and Balabhadra went to the river to bathe.

Reaching a secluded spot, Balabhadra asked Krishna, "Why is your face filled with long sighs and tears today? Your complexion is like a lotus wilted by frost, devoid of its radiance. Tell me the reason for this great sorrow." 

**13.** They marched towards Mathura, their armies adorned with elephants in a state of frenzy, their sudden arrival shattering the arrogant heart of the wicked Kansa.

**14.** Seeing the Yadava kings arriving in the vast city of Mathura, Kansa was filled with suspicion. However, when he was told that they had come to see their long-separated younger brother, Vasudeva, he put aside his doubts, went to meet them, greeted them with a forced smile, and bowed low. He then escorted all the brothers, including his younger brother, into the city.

**15.** Their eyes were filled with delight at the sight of the magnificent houses of Mathura. They were given the best accommodations by Kansa, the king of the city. They stayed in Mathura, and Kansa served them daily with gifts, respect, and salutations. Though they outwardly pretended to be filled with love, they harbored a burning fire within.

**16.** Balabhadra, who had understood the entire plan, whose body was as white as a bull, who was extremely wise, and whose intellect was highly skilled, desired to arouse the desire for battle in Krishna's heart. He said to Yashoda, in front of Gokula, "Hurry up and bathe."

**17-18.** "Why are you delaying? You are so lost in your own body that you have forgotten yourself. I have told you many times, but you still haven't changed your ways. Just like the ocean, which produces beautiful pearls from pure and auspicious oysters, doesn't abandon its fickleness, you too..."

Balabhadra had never spoken such harsh words to Yashoda, even though they had lived together for a long time. She was shocked and frightened. Though she didn't say anything, tears welled up in her eyes. She silently hurried to prepare for bathing and cooking, doing what was necessary. Krishna and Balabhadra went to the river to bathe.

**19.** Reaching a secluded spot, Balabhadra asked Krishna, "Why is your face filled with long sighs and tears today? Your complexion is like a lotus wilted by frost, devoid of its radiance. Tell me the reason for this great sorrow."

Seeing Padma, Krishna, with a smile on his face, answered the question asked by Balabhadra with love. "Listen to my words, O Arya! My heart's sorrow is evident from the changes on my face. You are a learned scholar, well-versed in the ways of the world, and you guide the people of the city. Tell me, O venerable one, was it right for our revered mother Yashoda to scorn you with such harsh words today?" ||20||

Hearing these words, Balabhadra, filled with grief, embraced Krishna tightly, his body trembling with joy. Then, with tears streaming down his face, he revealed his heart's pure intentions to Krishna, narrating the entire story. ||21||

He first recounted the unbreakable, truthful words spoken by the great sage to Jivadya, the daughter of Jarasandha, who was under the sway of her fierce ego, and who was the wife of Kamsa. Then, he spoke of the news that enraged Kamsa, who, with a heart filled with bitterness, had killed the six sons born to Devaki. He then mentioned that you were born prematurely and were immediately hidden in Gokul and entrusted to Yashoda. He then described the various schemes devised by the enemy to kill you from your childhood. Finally, he revealed that Kamsa is now determined to engage in a fierce wrestling match and has set his heart on killing you. ||22-24||

As Krishna learned from his elder brother Balabhadra about the entire Hari-Vamsa, his father, guru, relatives, and brothers, he was filled with joy, his face radiating beauty. His face, adorned with the splendor of Lakshmi, shone like a lion, protected by the mountain-like presence of his elder brother. ||25||

Then, the two brothers, whose hearts were united by the love born from their innate goodness, and who were like great fish, skilled in water sports, bathed in the Yamuna River. Afterwards, the two brothers, who were served by the Gopas, returned to their home accompanied by the Gopas.

The thirty-sixth chapter: Having eaten a meal of fragrant and freshly cooked rice, delicious lentils, vegetables, milk, and yogurt, seasoned with spices, on a bed of jewel-studded earth and a golden plate, they both went home together.  ||27||  After their meal, they rinsed their mouths with a mixture of sandalwood and other fragrant powders, applied a fragrant paste to their hands, and then, taking a fragrant paste in their palms, applied it to their bodies. They then ate betel leaves, mixed with green cardamom and other spices, which enhanced the natural redness of their lips and made their mouths even more beautiful. ||27-28||  Then, these two brothers, skilled in the art of wrestling, adorned in blue and yellow garments, with their chests smeared with red sandalwood powder, wearing fresh garlands of flowers and a garland of jasmine, and with their hearts set on destroying their enemy Kansa, set out for Mathura, their feet shaking the earth with their movements. They were accompanied by their fellow Gopas, all of them fierce warriors. ||29-30||  On their way, a demon, disguised as a serpent, blocked their path, followed by another demon disguised as a donkey, and a third disguised as a vicious horse. All three of them, with their mouths wide open, tried to obstruct their entry into the city. But Krishna killed them all. ||31||  As they entered the city, two elephants, Champka and Padabhar, were sent against them by their enemy. These elephants had brown cheeks adorned with lines of flowing musk. Seeing these elephants approaching, the two brothers were as pleased as if they had seen the best wrestlers on the battlefield. ||32||

Harivamsha Purana
Balarama, with a beautiful champaka flower in his hand, stood before the elephant named Fanira, while Krishna stood before the elephant named Padaamara. A new and wondrous wrestling match ensued between the human and elephant wrestlers, which filled the spectators with amazement. ||33||
The elephants, though their tusks were hidden behind their twisted trunks, were uprooted by the strong blows and heavy pressure of their feet. At that time, the elephants' tusks seemed like a group of large bamboo shoots, whose tips were being uprooted by the playful strength of a mountain, surrounded by snakes. ||34||
Then, mercilessly, the two brothers, having killed the elephants with the blows of their beautiful tusks, which sounded like thunderous roars, entered the city. At that time, Mathura seemed very large, filled with the loud cheers of the gopas. ||35||
Then, the two brothers entered the large arena, adorned with the beauty of its torana gate, decorated with lotus buds, and filled with kings and citizens, where a circular space was made for wrestling. They entered with joy, pushing the raised shoulders of the great wrestlers with their own shoulders. ||36||
At that time, the playful leaps and claps of Krishna and Balarama were very beautiful in the arena, their bodies adorned with the contraction and expansion of their feet and arms, their movements graceful with the firm placement of their eyes, and their clothes fluttering in the wind. ||37||
Upon reaching the arena, Balarama pointed out to Krishna, "This is Kansa, the enemy, here, these are the men of Jarasandha, and these are the ten brothers, including Samudravijaya, along with their sons." All the people were looking at the circle where Balarama and Krishna were standing. ||38||

**465** In the arena, where many citizens, kings, and other noblemen had gathered to watch, and where the excited shouts of all the wrestlers, along with the rhythmic sounds of their movements, created a captivating spectacle, the wrestlers, one after another, following the orders of Kansa, engaged in fierce battles, their pride and aggression resembling that of wild buffaloes. ||39||

After the ordinary wrestlers had fought, the wicked Kansa, desiring to pit Krishna against him, ordered the wrestler Chanura, who had a chest as broad as a mountain, and whose strong arms had thrown many arrogant wrestlers to the ground. Not only that, but he also signaled the wrestler Mustika with his menacing gaze, urging him to attack from behind. ||40||

Krishna and Chanura, both resembling lions in their stance and posture, with their feet firmly planted and their fists clenched with sharp nails, engaged in a relentless fistfight, striking each other with powerful blows. ||41||

Mustika, wielding a fist as hard as iron, was about to strike from behind, when Balarama, with lightning speed, shouted, "Stop! Stop!" and with a powerful blow to his jaw and head, rendered him lifeless. ||42||

Meanwhile, Krishna, with the strength of a lion and a resounding roar, embraced Chanura, who was twice his size, and with his powerful arms, squeezed him so tightly that blood gushed out, leaving him lifeless. ||43||

Krishna and Balarama possessed the strength of a thousand lions and elephants. Witnessing their valiant defeat of Kansa's two chief wrestlers, Kansa, wielding a sharp sword, charged towards them. His movement caused a mighty roar from the entire crowd, like the sound of the ocean. ||44||

Krishna, with lightning speed, snatched the sword from his enemy's hand, grabbed his hair, and with a surge of anger, threw him to the ground. Then, pulling his legs, and thinking, "This is the punishment he deserves," he smashed him against a rock, killing him. Krishna laughed after killing Kansa. ||45||

When the army of Kansa rushed forward in anger, Rama, with his eyebrows furrowed, uprooted a pillar from the platform and with his anger, he struck them with blows like the blows of a club, causing the army to flee in an instant. ||46||

Even though the army of Jarasandha, which was deployed in the service of Kansa, was enraged, it was destroyed when the powerful Yadavas, who were the bearers of fierce glances, rose up at the same time with their armies, making sounds like the churning of the ocean. ||47||

Then, the two brothers, adorned with the attire of wrestlers, mounted their chariots drawn by four horses, accompanied by a downpour of rain, and went to their father's house. That house was filled with a multitude of Yadavas, including the victorious kings of the ocean and others. ||48||

Upon arriving, the two brothers, in due order, bowed down and worshipped their teachers, starting with Samudravijaya, and received their blessings. Thus, with the first stream of water of their auspicious union, they extinguished the mental anguish caused by their long separation. ||49||

Vasudeva, who was like Kubera, and Devaki, seeing the face of their son, who had extinguished the fire of the enemy, were filled with unparalleled joy. Similarly, the girl whose nose had been flattened by Kansa, experienced unparalleled joy upon seeing her brother's face, for the union of sons and daughters in the world is for happiness. ||50||

Ugrasena, whose shackles had been broken and who was freed from the fear of Kansa, now, by the order of the Yadavas, enjoyed the company of his wife, the embodiment of the prosperity of the kingdom, who had become thin due to long separation, in Mathura, which had been given to him by Krishna. ||51||

On the other hand, Kansa, who had received the final rites of the body, surrounded by his relatives and wives, and whose heart was filled with anger towards the Yadavas, was unable to speak due to the tears choking his throat. ||52||

**467**

Then, the messenger of the king of the celestial beings, adorned with sparkling jewels, with a face like a blooming lotus, swiftly traversed the sky, like a fish playing in the ocean, carrying the news of the celestial beings.  ||53||

His body was fragrant with sandalwood, and he wore fine white clothes, resembling a swan bathing in the lake Manasarovar.  He arrived in Mathura, a city adorned with the best of kings (like swans), like the river Ganga flowing in all directions. ||54||

Then, the messenger, welcomed by the gatekeepers, entered the assembly hall adorned with the Yadavas.  He bowed down and addressed Krishna, the conqueror of enemies, the lord who knew the opportune moment, in the presence of the Yadavas. ||55||

"Hear, O king, praised by all kings!  There is a king named Suketa, who is like the banner of victory for the lineage of Nami and Vinamika, who is very clever in politics, and who resides in the city of Ratnapura Chakravala, situated in the southern region." ||56||

"He has sent me to you, with love, to test you with the signs of blowing the conch, lying on a serpent bed, and stringing the bow.  Although you are surrounded by those who give the best of things, I have a small request.  Please accept my daughter, Satyabhāma.  This act of yours will enhance the glory of the celestial realm and be the root of all good fortune." ||57||

Hearing the messenger's words, which were pleasing to all the Yadavas, Krishna, with a happy heart, replied, "Let the stream of jewels named Satyabhāma, created by the king of the celestial beings, Kubera, fall upon me, the mountain of jewels." ||58||

**Note:**  Some texts read "Naga-pati" (king of snakes) instead of "Dhanapati" (king of wealth).  In this case, the meaning of the verse would be: "Let the stream of water named Satyabhāma, created by the celestial being, the mountain of victory, fall upon me, the mountain of jewels." ||58||

Harivamsha Purana
The messenger of Khecharendra, King Suketu, whose mind was filled with joy, having been honored with due respect, went to his own place. There, he first praised the excellent qualities of Krishna and then, being pleased, informed the pleased King Suketu, along with his beloved, that all his tasks had been accomplished. || 59 ||
Knowing that Hari (Krishna) and Balabhadra, brothers, were shining on earth, and that they were destroyers of the pride, form, and brilliance of their enemies, the King of the Vidhyadharas, Suketu, and his brother, Ratimal, along with their daughters, came to Mathura. || 60 ||
Ratimal gave his daughter, Revati, who was like Rati herself in beauty, to his elder brother, Balabhadra. And the very happy Suketu gave his daughter, Satyabhama, born to Queen Swayamprabha, to Keshava (Krishna). || 61 ||
On the occasion of this marriage celebration, the women of the earth and the Vidhyadharas danced, their breasts like overflowing pots, their bodies burdened by the weight of their hips, their clothes, belts, hair, and upper garments loose, their anklets jingling, and their attire bright. || 62 ||
Seeing their sons, who were adorned with new brides, dressed in blue and yellow garments, whose bodies shone with the brilliance of various gem-studded ornaments, and who were surrounded by the Yadu kings, Rohini and Devaki, along with the other Yadava women, were extremely pleased. || 63 ||
In the first encounter, Satyabhama captured the heart of Krishna, and the extremely beloved Revati captured the heart of Balabhadra. Similarly, Krishna and Balabhadra, with the best use of their acquired skills and arts, captured their hearts. This is right, because clever people never fail when it comes to doing the right thing. || 64 ||
After that, the woman of Kansa, whose heart was filled with impurity, who was extremely distressed, and whose dark hair, like the Tamala flower, was scattered, went to King Jarasandha, lamenting the wrong done by the Yadu clan, like a creeper to a water body. || 65 ||

Page #507:
---------------------------
Trishah Sagah
"How could I, with you ruling the entire earth, be afflicted with the sorrow of widowhood, O father? This sorrow, however, I have borne with pride, to avenge the blood-soaked heads of my kin, the Yadavas, for their treachery." || 66 ||

Hearing these words, spoken almost like a lament, the king replied, "Daughter, do not grieve excessively. In this world, whatever happens, happens by the will of fate. The Lord, who disregards the strength of others, is the supreme power here." || 67 ||

"Even an animal, fearing death, remembers the way out of danger, and seeks a safe path before entering a field. But these intoxicated Yadavas, while killing your husband, forgot this obvious fact. This proves they desired death." || 68 ||

"My dear, even though they have sought refuge at your feet and are free from thorns, and even though they are branches of a strong lineage, they are destined to be consumed by the flames of my wrath, which will soon rain down upon them. They will be reduced to ashes, their names erased, and they will be forgotten, having crossed the path of hearing." || 69 ||

Thus, calming the fire of his daughter's anger with the waters of soothing words, the king, consumed by a raging fire of wrath, quickly ordered his son, Kalayavana, who was like Yama, the god of death, to destroy the Yadavas. || 70 ||

Kalayavana, with an army resembling a restless ocean, filled with elephants, horses, and chariots, swiftly marched against the enemy. He fought seventeen fierce battles with the Yadavas, and perished on the mountain called Atulmalavarta. || 71 ||

Thereafter, King Jarasandha quickly dispatched his brother, Aparajita, who was a conqueror of enemies, a precious life, who, by his own strength, could extinguish the flames of the apocalypse, who was propelled by the wind of his army, and who was eager to devour the enemy world. || 72 ||

Page #508:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, the valiant Aparajita, pleased with his victory, fought three hundred and thirty-six battles with the Yadavas amidst his enemies, but in the end, he fell lifeless to the earth, pierced by the sharp point of Krishna's arrow. Lying on the earth, the glorious Aparajita seemed to be resting on a heroic bed, as if he were merely taking a break from his fatigue. ||73||

Thereafter, the Yadavas, who were constantly filled with joy, resided in Krishnapuri Mathura, their fear of enemies dispelled by the unyielding valor of Krishna and Balabhadra. They engaged in playful activities with the citizens of Mathura. ||74||

Gautama Swami says that the stream of water from the cloud of Jina-mata, which is like a brother to all beings, increases the prosperity of the fruits of the earth, and is adorned with a garland of Lakshmi and fame, quenches the pride of the fierce fire of the enemy army, and generates immense joy among the relatives. ||75||

Thus ends the thirty-sixth chapter of the Harivamsha Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which is a collection of the Arishta-nemi Purana, and narrates the slaying of Kansa and Aparajita. ||26||

## Chapter Thirty-Seven: The Story of the Lineage

This is a very sacred Yavritta verse, which was sung by the Shrenik, a great joy to the people. Listen, O resident of the city of Susauriya, I will tell you the wondrous story of the main Dasha. ||3||

From the time of the Jina's descent from the heavens, six months before his birth, the gods, following the command of Indra, showered the house of King Samudravijaya with gold. ||2||

This rain of gold, falling daily in a quantity of three and a half crore, filled the world with joy. It satisfied all the beggars. Indeed, what difference is there in the recipients of a rain of wealth? ||3||

From the directions, the Dikkumari goddesses, who had come from the front of the directions, were serving the mother Shivadevi with devotion. They were announcing that the victorious Jina, who was about to be born in the mother's womb, had conquered the entire group of directions in the three worlds. ||4||

Seeing various wonders with her husband, Shivadevi's mind was filled with great joy. One night, while sleeping, she saw sixteen auspicious dreams. ||5||

In the first dream, she saw Indra's Airavata elephant, from whose every side flowed continuous streams of intoxicating water. The elephant filled the directions with its sound, and on its back, black bees, like dark tamala flowers, buzzed. The elephant was as stable as Mount Kailasa. ||6||

In the second dream, she saw Ambika's great bull, with beautiful horns, a high hump, hooves that dug into the earth, a very long tail and neck, and very long eyes. The bull was white in color, and its voice was as deep as the roar of a cloud. ||7||

8. It entered the sky, resounding with a loud noise, and appeared like a cloud-laden with rain in the autumn season.

9. She saw the goddess of wealth (Lakshmi) who was anointed with fragrant water from the trunks of excellent elephants, seated on a lotus seat, and holding a lotus in her hand.

10. She saw two pure garlands hanging down, whose threads had become reddish due to the pollen of flowers, and which were more tender than her own delicate arms.

11. She saw the moon, which had risen by dispelling the dense darkness with its sharp rays, and which appeared like the steady laughter of the night-goddess.

12. She saw the sun, whose face was visible throughout the day, which was golden-hued due to the vermilion-like glow of dusk, which appeared like the son of the eastern goddess (Ushas), and which gave lasting delight to the eyes.

13. She saw a pair of fish that were restless like lightning, whose eyes were like the trembling eyes of an excellent woman, and which were engaged in loving play without any jealousy.

14. The lotus-eyed goddess saw two beautiful water-filled pitchers, whose mouths were adorned with lotuses, which were made of excellent gold, and which appeared like the natural swelling of breasts.

15. Then she saw a magnificent lake, filled with auspicious water, adorned with lotuses, associated with royal swans and other birds, captivating the mind, and as pure as her own mind.

16. She saw a great ocean, its waves rising high, adorned with coral, pearls, and flowers, frothing with foam, turbulent, and a home to fearsome crocodiles.

17. She saw a throne, the seat of Lakshmi, held by a lion, strong with claws and teeth, fierce-eyed, adorned with shining ornaments, its brilliance staining the faces of the directions red.

18. She saw a celestial chariot in the sky, adorned with various banners, its arms adorned with garlands of victory, shining with hanging pearls and jewels.

19. She saw a magnificent, radiant palace of the serpent king, illuminated by the light of gems on its hoods, filled with the sweet music of serpent maidens, shining with brilliant jewels, and rising from the earth.

20. She saw a treasure of divine gems, adorned with red lotus gems and shining diamonds, crowned with the finest jewels, blocking the directions with Indra's bow, and touching the sky.

21. She saw a fire, fierce with flames, illuminating the directions with its bright rays at night, revealing its gentle form, bringing joy like Lakshmi herself.

22. Then, on the sixth day of the bright fortnight of Kartik, shaking the seats of the gods, the Lord descended from heaven, taking the form of a white elephant, and entered the mother's womb.

**Meaning:**

Due to the rise of the karma of the name, the size of the Lord's soul remains the same as the previous body. The phrase "taking the form of a white elephant" means that after seeing sixteen dreams, the mother saw a white elephant descending from the sky and entering her womb.

1.  Dwij-(?) M.
2.  The light of the gems on the hoods of the serpents, the serpent maidens, their sweet music, all combined.

Harivamsha Purana
Seeing those sixteen dreams, which were continuous and uninterrupted, with intervals in between, the mother Shiva Devi's eyes, free from sleep, became filled with joy and auspicious music. She then got out of bed, free from laziness. ||23||
In the morning, adorned with auspicious ornaments, Shiva Devi, out of curiosity, went to her husband and paid her respects. She then narrated all the dreams she had seen in the night, one by one. Then, King Samudravijaya, the possessor of a calm mind, explained the meaning of those dreams as follows: ||24||
My dear, this wonderful rain of wealth, whose origin is being told, and for whom the Dikkumari Devis are serving you, that Tirthankara has come and resides in your womb today. ||25||
My dear, with beautiful thighs, what can be said about the fruit of your dreams? Because you are the mother of a Tirthankara. Your Tirthankara son will be born. Although this much fruit of the dreams is enough, still, the fruit that the supreme Guru of the three worlds will attain, that is being told, understand it. ||26||
O slender-waisted one! You saw many elephants in your dream, the fruit of that is that your son will protect many beings. He will imitate the gait of the elephant with his own gait and will attain the sovereignty of the three worlds according to his desire. ||27||
My dear, seeing the bull, your son will be the possessor of a pure mind and will be the Guru of the world. Just as the bull adorns the herd of cows, in the same way, he will adorn his family and the three worlds with his qualities. He will have bright eyes like a bull and a raised shoulder. ||28||
Seeing the lion, he will be the possessor of infinite strength. Just as the lion makes the intoxicated elephants free from intoxication, in the same way, he will make all the men who are full of pride, free from pride. He will be great, unique, brave, and in the end, the master of the forest of penance, that is, he will take initiation and perform severe penance.
1. He is M. | 2. He protects many beings, hence many. | 3. From seeing the elephant. | 4. The elephant's gait is imitated by him, which is delayed. | 5. Brave, fierce, and the master of the forest of penance, K. |

In the Harivamsha Purana, it is said that the feet of the one who is the lord of vimanas and the lord of the immortals will be worshipped by countless gods, as it is indicated by the sight of his excellent vimana. He will be free from mental anguish, a bearer of great prosperity, and will descend from the chief vimana here. ||39||
It is revealed by the sight of the serpent king's departing abode that your son will be the one who breaks through the cage of the world, and he will be born with three principal eyes: mati, shruti, and avadhi-jnana. ||40||
By seeing the multitude of jewels in the sky, you should believe that your son will be adorned with many kinds of radiant rays, a multitude of jewels representing various virtues will take refuge in him, and he will be the one who gives refuge to those who seek refuge. ||41||
By seeing the smoke-free fire, radiant and with a clockwise motion, in the sky filled with a multitude of flames, it is proven that your son will manifest the great, fierce fire of meditation and burn the forest of all karmas. ||42||
My dear, by the influence of that son, Indra, adorned with a crown and excellent earrings, will be my obedient servant, like an ordinary king. ||43||
My dear, the Indranis, whose own garlands are adorned with their braids, and who are adorned with the pleasing sounds of their girdles and anklets, will always be eager to serve you in matters of decoration, etc., by the influence of your son. ||44||

Hearing the interpretation of her dream from her husband, Queen Shivadevi's heart was filled with joy. Thinking, "The son with all the aforementioned qualities has come into my lap," she began to perform excellent actions like *Jina* worship, etc., which would captivate the minds of all the people. ||46||

Gautama Swami says, "The person who recites, remembers, or listens to this *stotra* (hymn) describing the fruits of dreams related to the birth of the *Jina* every morning and evening, attains the wealth of the *Jina*. ||47||

Thus ends the thirty-seventh chapter of the *Harivansha* Purana, composed by Jinaseenaacharya, which is a collection of the *Arishta-nemi* Purana, and describes the fruits of dreams. ||37||

**Earth Chanda**

Following the command of Indra, Dhanapati, though devoted to his own devotion, went to the Tirtha waters and, with auspicious fragrant Parijata flowers and rare, excellent ornaments from the world, he worshipped the parents of the Jina. ||1||

As the sky holds the moon in its pure belly, so too did Shiva, the mother of the Jina, with the well-known Dikkumari goddesses, having purified her pure belly, first hold the womb, which was filled with rising light, which would increase the ocean of her kin, and which would remove the rise of suffering, for the good of the world. ||2||

Driven by great compassion, she did not hinder the vine-like Shiva, whose waist was slender and bent under the weight of her breasts, nor did she destroy the beauty of her trivali waves, nor did she hinder the leaves of her lips with her breath, nor did she allow her to be lazy. ||3||

As if to reveal the hidden birth of the Jina's body in her womb, the weight of Shiva's breasts became filled with milk, and her hips, bound by a dense belt, became wider, as if bearing the weight of the breasts. ||4||

At that time, under the influence of the Jina, Shiva's mind was devoted to protecting the world and observing all the elements, her speech was devoted to speaking beneficially and destroying all doubts, and her body was devoted to wearing the ornaments of vows and nurturing humility. ||5||

The mother of the Jina, consuming the nectar-like food prepared by the celestial women, which increased her infinite virtues, radiance, and strength, even though her body was thin, shone like lightning, illuminating the ten directions with a golden radiance. ||6||

The Thirty-eighth Chapter
479
The mighty Samudravijaya, who was daily increasing in grandeur, was adorned by the waves resembling the trunks of mighty elephants, the leaping schools of high-jumping fish, the large ships like chariots, and the armies of kings like rivers - all of which were favorable to him. ||7||

The parents of the Lord of the Jinas, who were worshipped by the circle of the world at the time of dissolution, whose great pride was ever increasing, and who were endowed with the splendor bestowed by the command of the great Indra and the deities, passed nine months happily. ||8||

Then, on the auspicious thirteenth lunar day of the bright half of Vaisakha, when the moon was in conjunction with the Citra constellation and all the auspicious planets were in their proper positions, the auspicious Shiva gave birth to the son who was the conqueror of the world, the remover of sins. ||9||

The child, who had the vision of pure knowledge, who was marked with the thousand and eight auspicious signs, and whose body was beautiful like the blue lotus, illumined the multitude of gem-like lamps in the lying-in chamber with his own splendor. ||10||

At the time of the rising of the moon-like Jina, she who had white breasts, whose face was like the full moon, who was adorned with a multitude of shining stars, who was extremely beautiful, and who was situated in the cage of the waves, was willingly embraced by the ocean of love. ||11||

The earth of Jambudvipa, which had the deep navel-like mountain as its neck, which was adorned with the streams of flowing rivers like a garland, and whose girdle was the resounding platform, began to tremble as if dancing in joy. ||12||

He whose face was radiant like the Anuttara Vimana, whose head was adorned with liberation, whose chin was like the Anudish, whose neck was like the Nava-Griveya, whose body was like the Sukalpa, whose waist was like the Madhyaloka, and whose thighs were like the Adholoka, that three-world-man was dancing, as if he were holding his waist and dancing. ||13||
At that time, due to the influence of the birth of the Jina, the sound of conch shells resounded in the realm of the Bhavanavasi Devas. In the realm of all the Vyantara Devas, the sound of the Patha drum echoed quickly. In the realm of the Sun, the roar of the lion resounded, and in the mansions of the Kalpavasis, the sound of the great bells rang. ||14||
Then, the kings of the Devas and Asuras, who were dwelling in the three worlds, whose crowns and thrones were trembling, who had used their knowledge of the future to know about the birth of the Jina, and who were filled with great joy, set out for the land of Bharata, accompanied by the Devas of the four categories. ||15||
The Ahmimdra Devas, who were the holders of the most pure and perfect vision, whose crowns were adorned with countless jewels, whose rays of light filled all directions, although they were residing in their own abodes, came forward seven steps from their thrones and bowed to the Jina. ||16||
The Asura Kumaras, Naga Kumaras, Vidyut Kumaras, Agni Kumaras, Vayu Kumaras, Dvipa Kumaras, Mahodadhi Kumaras, Stanita Kumaras, and Udadhi Kumaras, these ten types of Bhavanavasi Devas, shining brightly, emerged from the earth in all ten directions. ||17||
The Kimpurushas, Kinnaras, Mahoragas, Rakshasas, Pisachas, Bhutas, Yakshas, and Gandharvas, whose women were skilled in captivating the mind, and who were adorned with songs and various dances, came from all sides, being the eight types of Vyantara Devas who resided in the Madhyaloka. ||18||
The group of the five types of famous Jyotish Devas, known as Graha, Nakshatra, Chandrama, Surya, and Tara, who were adorned with bright rays, appeared together in their Vimanas, as if they were about to create another Jyotishaloka on earth. ||19||

481. As they were, each with their own seven types of armies, the sixteen Indras, from the first heaven to the sixteenth, along with their hosts of gods, arrived together, overcome by joy. ||20||

The lord of the Sudharma heaven, riding on his elephant, the mighty Airavata, shone brightly, like a moving Himalaya, adorned with the beautiful dances of celestial nymphs, their graceful movements displayed in the midst of the many-mouthed, lotus-bud-like, teeth-shaped, petal-like, beautiful, and lovely, dance-filled, shining, celestial palaces. ||21||

The army of the gods, surrounding Indra, shone brightly, divided into seven divisions, circular in shape, endowed with natural valor, and blocking the space of the sky with a forest of weapons like clubs and other weapons. ||22||

Then there was the vast army of horses, swift as the wind, quickly conquering the wind itself, uniting and separating the spaces of the three worlds with their neighing, and resembling the waves of the ocean of the sky. ||23||

Then there was the army of bulls, standing all around, adorned with beautiful faces, beautiful testicles, lotus-like eyes, charming tails, sounds, beautiful bodies, snouts, golden hooves, and horns, and radiating the brilliance of the moon. ||24||

Then there was the army of chariots, shining brightly, itself diverse in seven ways, yet impenetrable by mountains, resembling the vehicles of the gods in the ocean of the sky, conquering the radiant chariot of the sun, extremely beautiful, and encircled by a ring. ||25||

Then there was the army of elephants, resembling clouds, showering water all around, with their trunks raised, roaring loudly, very heavy, and presided over by great gods, spreading the beauty of the rainy season with their many different formations. ||26||

And then there was the army of Gandharvas, with their seven types of sweet, melodious, soft, and gentle voices, mixed with the sounds of lutes, flutes, and drums, filling the entire universe, shining brightly, and beloved by the young celestial nymphs. ||27||

The celestial army of dancers, adorned with garlands and ornaments, filled the sky with their graceful movements, their bodies like blooming trees, their hearts like fragrant blossoms. Their hips swayed rhythmically, their steps slow and deliberate, their presence a feast for the senses. (28)

Each celestial division consisted of seven concentric circles. The first circle contained eighty-four thousand horses, bulls, and other animals. The number doubled in each subsequent circle, creating a harmonious progression. (29)

The celestial beings, each leading their own army, descended from the heavens, their hearts filled with joy, to witness the birth and coronation of the Jina. The celestial maidens, adorned with auspicious symbols, performed the sacred rituals with reverence and devotion. (30)

Among these celestial beings were Vijaya, the victorious, Vaidyanti, the radiant, Aparajita, the invincible, Jayanti, the triumphant, Nanda, the joyful, Ananda, the blissful, Nandavardhana, the prosperity-enhancing, and Nandottama, the supreme joy-bringer. Their bodies were as full and rounded as the breasts of a woman, their beauty enhanced by the delicate fragrance of their garlands, which dripped with the nectar of love. (31-32)

Yashodhara, the renowned, Suprabuddha, the enlightened, Sukirti, the virtuous, Susthita, the steadfast, Pranidhi, the devoted, Lakshmimati, the prosperous, Chitra, the adorned with diverse qualities, and Vasundhara, the earth goddess, stood tall, holding mirrors of polished gems, their radiance rivaling that of the moonlit sky. (33)

Ila, Navamika, Sura, Pita, Padmavati, Prithvi, Pravarakanchana, and Chandrika, adorned with sparkling stars, their bodies radiating light, stood by the side of the Jina's mother, holding a white canopy above her head, their presence as luminous as the moonlit night. (34)

After the celestial musicians, whose sweet melodies, blending the sounds of the veena, flute, and drums, filled the heavens with a symphony of seven notes, came the celestial dancers, their bodies adorned with garlands and ornaments, their movements graceful and captivating. (27)

Following the celestial dancers, came the celestial courtesans, their bodies swaying rhythmically, their presence a feast for the senses, their movements like the blooming of celestial flowers. (28)

## Chapter Thirty-Eight

**35.**  Shriya, Dhriti, Asha, Varuni,  Pundarikinī,  Alambusa,  Mishrakeshi, and Hiya,  all these goddesses stood with chamaras in their hands, adorned like the Ganges and other rivers,  overflowing with foam and waves.

**36.**  Kanakanakchitra,  Chitra,  Trishīras,  and  Sūtramaṇi,  renowned among the gods of the three worlds,  these goddesses,  like lightning,  were shining near the Jina,  as if they were vines of lightning,  destroying darkness near the clouds.

**37.**  Along with them,  the foremost of all the lightning goddesses,  Ruchka-prabha,  Ruchka,  Ruchka-bha,  and  Ruchka-jjvala,  and the four foremost of the directional goddesses,  Vijay and others,  were performing the Jina's birth ceremony,  following the proper rituals.

**38.**  Before the Jina's birth,  Kubera had adorned the city of Suryapur with wondrous beauty.  His palaces were adorned with tall,  lofty flags,  and he seemed eager to conquer the splendor of the Indra-loka.  The gods and asuras of the four realms,  along with their respective Indras,  came quickly,  paying homage to the Jina,  and circumambulated the city three times,  gazing at its beauty.

**39.**  Then,  Indra,  the friend of the virtuous and the knower of proper conduct,  entered the city and stood near the palace of Shiva.  With respect,  he ordered the pure and playful Indrani to bring the newborn child.  Following her husband's command,  Indrani entered the delivery room.  At that time,  Indrani,  filled with respect,  was radiating beauty.

**40.**  There,  she respectfully bowed to the Jina-mother and,  using divine magic,  put her to sleep.  Then,  she placed another child,  created by divine magic,  beside her.  After that,  Indrani gently picked up the Jina child and gave him to her husband,  Indra.  The king of the gods,  Indra,  bowed to the Jina child with his head and took him in his arms.

**41.**  Indra,  with his thousand eyes,  could not be satisfied even after gazing at the Jina child,  whose face was like the moon,  whose eyes had conquered the white lotus,  whose radiance had surpassed the beauty of the forest of blue lotuses,  and whose hands and feet had conquered the lotuses.

The Indra, whose head was adorned with the lofty jewel of the Indra-nila gem, placed the Jina child on the summit of the crystal mountain, the form of the elephant Airavata. At that time, the Indra was resplendent with waving chowries and umbrellas, and it seemed as if the ocean itself, filled with foam, was moving, with its multitude of surging waves. || 42 ||
The elephant Airavata had thirty-two mouths, each mouth had eight teeth, each tooth had a lake, each lake had a lotus, each lotus had thirty-two petals, and on each petal danced an Apsara, filled with the finest nectar. || 43 ||
With such extraordinary glory, the gods approached Mount Meru, circumambulated it, and entered the vast forest called Panduka. There, on the summit of the great Panduka rock, they placed the Jina child on the throne, five hundred bows high. || 44 ||
Then, with the groups of divine women, adorned with the implements of worship, standing all around, and with the groups of excellent dancers, delighting in the new festival, and captivating the gods with their clear and excellent rasa, bhava, hava, and laya, and with the sound of drums, conch shells, lion roars, and kettle drums, amplified by the echoes of the vast caves of Mount Sumeru, filling the middle of the world with the sounds that were as clear as the qualities of the Jina, and pleasing to the ears, and with the groups of various colored banners, incense, and the finest flowers, spreading throughout the sky, and with the fragrant wind, born from the Panduka forest, filling the mouths of the directions with its sweet scent, and pleasing to the heart, the king of the gods, Vasava, holding the many forms of the Jina, and surrounded by the gods, began the great abhisheka of the Jina, out of devotion. He wished to anoint the Jina with the fragrant water of the ocean, poured from jewel and gold pitchers, brought by the immortals. || 48 ||

How did it continue? || 41 ||

**485**

The sky was filled with rows of celestial beings, their hands adorned with sparkling, gem-studded pitchers, radiating joy. The space between Mount Meru and the Milky Ocean was illuminated, as if being carried by countless ropes, a spectacle of grandeur. **49**

"Take the pitcher, quickly, bring it, and hold it before the Lord!" The celestial beings, their voices melodious, passed the pitchers from hand to hand, their procession resembling a flock of swans gracefully entering the Panduka forest. **50**

Rows of pitchers, crafted from gold, gems, and silver, moved with the swiftness of the wind, like a garland of the sun and moon. The celestial beings, their faces turned towards the sky, were adorned with radiant wings, resembling countless flocks of Garuda and swans soaring through the heavens. **51**

With thousands of pitchers, filled with pure water, raised by the arms of Indra, like thunderous clouds, the Tirthankara received the abhisheka, turning Mount Meru white. This is fitting, for even the impure can attain purity through the touch of the pure. **52**

All the celestial kings, like Indra, and others, whose hearts were filled with the joy of attaining the Jain teachings, whose bodies trembled with devotion, and whose oceans of worldly existence had dwindled, performed the abhisheka with pure water, fulfilling their desires. **53**

Then, the celestial queens, led by Sachi, approached the Tirthankara, their hands soft and fragrant, and performed the udvartana (a cleansing ritual) with fragrant substances. They then performed the abhisheka with pitchers filled with auspicious water, their hands resembling the beautiful breasts of celestial beings. **54**

**Notes:**

* **Abhisheka:** A sacred ritual of anointing, often performed with water or milk.
* **Udvartana:** A cleansing ritual, often involving fragrant substances.

In the Harivamsha Purana, the auspicious Shuma mountain, adorned with the best garments, jewel ornaments, garlands, and unguents, was made resplendent and dedicated to the Lord, the master of great fortune, who was named Arishtanemi by the great Indra. The groups of gods and demons then circumambulated him, pleased and satisfied, and praised him with various hymns. ||55||
Thus ends the thirty-eighth chapter of the Harivamsha Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which contains the collection of the Arishtanemi Purana and describes the birth and coronation of the Lord. ||38||

The forty-first chapter: 'The one who has fully developed all knowledge, perception and clairvoyance, who is pure in his actions, who is awake and has a unique vision, who has seen all the moving and non-moving beings in the three worlds. He has adorned himself with the pure gems of right faith, right knowledge and right conduct, which are the three aspects of the path, and has accumulated the auspicious nature of a Tirthankara through the intense austerities of his past lives, which are rooted in the sixteen causes. ||1||

From the state of that Tirthankara nature and the stages of his experience, a great ocean of extraordinary and wonderful merit arose, which, like the wind, stirred the mountains of the families of the gods, who served his feet. He is the chief of the age, and his pure fame is proclaimed by the sound of the drums, which are amplified by the buzzing of the bees, who are the devout souls, who are not satisfied with seeing his lotus-like face. ||2||

O Lord! You have purified all of Bharatavarsha with the purity of your birth, which is made white by your fame. You have conquered the sun with the brilliance of your body, which is like the peak of the great mountain of the Hari dynasty, which is like a young sun. O Lord! You have conquered the full moon with the brilliance of your body, which is more radiant than any other. And you have adorned the faces of all the directions with the clusters of your brilliance, which are like the blue sapphire. Therefore, O Nemijinaendra! I bow to you. ||3||

O Lord! O Supreme Lord! O Creator of the Universe! O Incomparable! O Unique! You are the teacher of the three worlds, and you are the possessor of a keen intellect. As soon as you were born here, you showed the path of liberation, which is beneficial, famous and incomparable. By accepting it and performing various austerities, the devout souls have destroyed all their sinful karma, which is like dirt, according to the rules. ||4||

Indra began to praise Nemijinaendra in this way.

O Pranatipriya! O Devotee-Beloved! Now you will cross the vast ocean of the world, filled with the terrible suffering of birth, old age, and death, and attain the peak of liberation, the summit of all worlds. The sages proclaim that this is the supreme, unique, imperishable, and self-beneficial path, where the great, all-pervading, self-existent, eternally rising, boundless, and blissful state is attained, a state that is unattainable by the unworthy. 5. The happiness that is found here, O Lord, is the cause of the great prosperity of the gods and humans, including Indra and the kings, who are bound by the lordship of the universe. 6. You are the master of the teachings that explain the principles of creation, destruction, and sustenance. Only by following your teachings will one attain liberation, not by relying on other doctrines. Therefore, let everyone take refuge in you. Those who, with unwavering faith, embrace your teachings and become free from the bonds of ignorance, are the ones who achieve their purpose in this world, O Jinendra. 7. O Lord! You are adorned with the splendor of sweet and beneficial words, you are the destroyer of the world, you have filled the spaces between the directions with fragrance, you are endowed with excellent cohesion, excellent structure, and excellent form, you are adorned with all auspicious qualities, your body's blood is like milk, you are the knower of taste and feeling, your body is free from impurities, free from sweat, you are filled with infinite strength that pervades the earth. 8. You have conquered Kamadeva (the god of desire) with the self-knowledge of restraint. You are the sustainer of the happiness of the world. 9. O Lord! We, the devotees, bow down to you, who are infinite in your qualities.

**10.** O Lord! Even the mighty Mount Meru, which is thousands of yojanas high, is like a mere instrument for your power. Who else, O Lord, can make this magnificent mountain a glorious bathing place, a place of supreme bliss, except you, the possessor of boundless wisdom?

**13.** O Lord! Your magnificence is immeasurable, revered by gods and humans alike, who are all wealthy in respect. Who else in this world, even those born in heaven, can attain such magnificence as yours, O Jina?

**12.** O Lord! Even in your childhood, you were a being of extraordinary power, a benefactor of all beings, praised by the three worlds. You are the source of joy, both physical and mental, for those who are humbled by the weight of your new devotion.

**13.** O Lord! You are like a lion, destroying the elephant of lust. You are like Garuda, the king of birds, subduing the great serpent of anger. You are like a thunderbolt, shattering the mountain of pride. You are like a blazing fire, consuming the forest of greed.

**14.** O Lord! You are steadfast in your possession of the divine nature. You are endowed with the qualities of Vishnu. You are the master of the inconceivable Arhat path. You are the one who will attain the Brahma path.

**15.** Thus, the gods, with a chorus of truthful words, praised the Lord and bowed down to him. They prayed to the Lord, the savior from the terrible cycle of birth and death, for this one boon: "O Lord! May we attain the supreme enlightenment."

**Notes:**

1. "Na purushaḥ bhaṭaḥ kināmādheyaḥ" - This means "No man is a warrior, what is his name?"
2. "Nākabhuvo'pi" - This means "Even those born in heaven."

Hariwamsha Purana
Verse describing the coronation ceremony of the Jina

Then, the devas, filled with joy and reverence, were blowing the conches loudly in the sky, as if they were vomiting the extremely pure nectar that had emerged from the churning of the ocean of nectar. Along with the sound of the conches, the deep resonance of the dundubhi (kettledrum), mridanga (drum), and panavas (small drums) were heard, as well as the abundant notes of the flutes and veenas, all proclaiming the coronation festival of the Jinesvara (Lord of the Jinas).

This proclamation seemed to pervade the entire cosmos, reaching the furthest corners of all directions. The groups of Vidyadharas (celestial beings) and divine damsels were engaged in captivating dances, their sublime songs and music filled with the most excellent expressions of love, humor, and wonder. 

The lord of Sadharmakalpika (a celestial realm), in a state of reverent excitement, mounted the elevated shoulder of the rising Airavata (the elephant of Indra) and proceeded towards the mountain of heroic fame, which was thronged by the mighty Yadava kings, akin to lions. The pure white parasol was waving over the Jinesvara, and the fluttering chauris (yak-tail whisks) were fanning him, while the groups of Apsaras (celestial nymphs) were singing the most pure glories of the Jina.

The lord of Sadharmakalpika had filled the entire sky with his armies of all kinds. The renowned groups of devas, absorbed in acts of reverence, praise, and musical performance, were joyfully honoring the Jina as befitting. The assemblage of the lords of the three worlds were intent on serving at the lotus feet of the Jina, who was bestowing upon them the greatest bliss.

In this way, the Jina, who embodied the supreme and wondrous lordship transcending the world, the son of the goddess Shiva, was being praised with auspicious words like "Grow in prosperity", "Increase", and "Live long".

The forty-first chapter:

With a garland of variegated flowers, emitting an extraordinary fragrance, and with a friend standing nearby to alleviate his distress, the Lord Tirthankara, with a gentle breeze caressing his body, was embraced. He was adorned with beautiful garments befitting his childhood, and his body was radiant with the brilliance of exceptional ornaments and garlands. His form was as dark as a cloud, and he was anointed with fragrant sandalwood, his body shining with the radiance of the full moon. He was the bearer of the fortune of the Indra-blue mountain, and he was surrounded by a divine army. He quickly crossed the northern direction and reached his own glorious city of Suryapura, where the sky was filled with the sound of drums and the fluttering of banners. The wide roads were drenched with divine, fragrant water and obstructed by showers of falling flowers. This city was a treasure trove of wealth and was adorned with auspicious rituals. There, Lord Neminatha, the wonder of the world, manifested a wonder that astonished all beings.

Even as a child, his beauty was not like that of ordinary children, but rather like that of an adult. He was the child-sun who caused the lotus-like people of Krishna and Suryapura to bloom. He was seated on the head of the great elephant king, Airavata, who was extremely tall. Indra, with his own power of action, took the child-Jina and placed him in his mother's lap. Then, Indra, with his own power of action, created a thousand arms, each adorned with the brilliance of his shoulders, and on them, he carried thousands of celestial women, who danced gracefully in various ways. The Yadavas, who were seated in front, watched this spectacle with great joy, considering it to be more valuable than the gain of the entire earth. Indra, the king, performed a great dance called Mahānanda, which captivated the eyes of all. This dance was adorned with the unbroken beauty of the perfect Tāṇḍava, and it was accompanied by the sounds of various musical instruments.

In the Harivamsha Purana, having adorned the Jina with ornaments that are difficult to obtain even in death, the king of the gods, Indra, placed the ambrosia-like main food in the right thumb of the Jina for protection. He appointed the young gods, who were of the same age as the Jina, for play. He instructed Kubera, who was free from negligence, to make all arrangements suitable for the welfare of the Jina, taking into account the Jina's state, time, and season. Having firmly conveyed this instruction, Indra inquired from the Jina's parents and, having received their permission, considered himself to have fulfilled his duty. He then departed with all the Indra-like gods of the four directions, just as he had arrived. Indra's journey was successful.

After completing their respective tasks, the Dik Kumaris, the daughters of the directions, approached the Arya Putri, the mother Shiva, along with the Jina child, and paid their respects. Filled with great joy, they illuminated the ten directions with the radiance of their bodies and departed to their respective places. Meanwhile, the Nemijina, the moon-like Jina, who delighted the entire world with his rays of virtue, was growing day by day, adorned with Lakshmi, even though he was a child, he engaged in activities befitting an elder. He was nurtured by his family and the gods.

Gautama Swami says that this hymn is related to the birth and coronation of Nemijina, whose extraordinary influence pervades the three worlds. He is the remover of sin, the guide to the path of virtue, the essence of the world, the one who is close to liberation, the source of joy for the noble beings, the destroyer of negligence, the giver of dharma. His name is heard with great joy, remembered, and chanted. This hymn, which is read, heard, and constantly contemplated, bestows the wealth of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct in this world. It provides mental and physical happiness, peace, nourishment, satisfaction, and

The three jewels of Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct, together with the **Chaityasharira** (body of merit), are the source of happiness, peace, nourishment, and contentment. They are the cause of the accumulation of great merit, which leads to the attainment of numerous blessings in this life and the next. They are the cause of the destruction of thousands of types of **Aasrava** (influx of karma) that are the source of all sins. They destroy even the most terrible sins accumulated in past lives due to attachment, delusion, and other such emotions. This is the main hymn that generates supreme devotion towards the **Jinendra** (Jina).

Thus ends the forty-ninth chapter of the **Harivaṃśa** (a Jain text), composed by **Jinaseṇa Ācārya**, which is part of the **Ariṣṭanemi Purāṇa** and describes the praise sung by Indra during the birth ceremony. || 39 ||

**Notes:**

1. **Chaityasharira** - A body of merit accumulated through virtuous actions.
2. **Aasrava** - Influx of karma that binds the soul to the cycle of birth and death.
3. **Jinendra** - A liberated soul, a Jina.

Forty-first Chapter: Having heard of the death of his brother, Jarasandha, immersed in the ocean of grief, was sustained by the ship of anger towards his enemies. ||1||  Skilled in all policies and valor, he resolved to destroy all the Yadavas and, fearless, informed his group of friends to go forth to meet the enemy. ||2||  Kings, the lords of their commands, who desired the welfare of their master, arrived with their excellent four-armed forces, having received his orders. ||3||  The clever Yadavas, with their eyes like those of lions, quickly learned of his journey, which was like an endless ocean of soldiers. ||4||  Then, the elders of the Vrishni and Bhoj lineages, who were wise in scriptures and who understood the true nature of things, became eager to make a plan. ||5||  They said, "His command, divided into three parts, has never been broken by others. He is extremely fierce, his rule is also extremely fierce, he is arrogant due to the strength of his weapons like the discus, sword, mace, and club, he is grateful for favors done to him, he forgives those who commit offenses and become humble, he has never done us any harm, he has always been eager to do good, but now, filled with anger to remove the stain of defeat caused by the death of his mother and brother, he is coming towards us, fearing us." ||6-8||  He is so arrogant that he does not even see our divine and human strength, which is clearly evident. ||9||  The power of Krishna's virtue and the valor of Balarama - all this supreme glory has been evident since childhood. ||10||  Even though he is a child, the dominion of the Neminath Tirthankara, who shakes the throne of Indra, is manifest in the three worlds. ||11||

All the Lokapalas are busy protecting it, who among humans in the lineage of the Tirthankara can harm it?  ||12|| Who, being ignorant, would touch with his hand the blazing fire that consumes all? And who, desiring victory, would confront the Tirthankara, Balabhadra, and Krishna? ||13|| This king Jarasandha is the enemy of Narayana, and these Balabhadra and Narayana are surely born here. ||14|| Therefore, until this enemy-like moth, along with its wings (helpers, allies), is consumed by the fire of Krishna, we will quickly, after the war, take our seats elsewhere and bring the valiant Krishna to victory. At this time, it is appropriate for us to take refuge in the west and remain silent for a few days, for by doing so, the success of our work is certain. ||15-17|| We will remain silent in this way, but if Jarasandha confronts us, we will honor him with war and send him to Yama. ||18|| Having thus discussed, they revealed the plan in their fort and announced the departure with the sound of the conch. ||19|| Hearing the sound of the conch, the four-armed army of the Yadus and Bhojvanshis set out. ||20|| The people of Mathura, Shauryapur, and Veeryapur, with their love for their lord, also set out. ||21|| All the people of the four varnas, along with the righteous, considered this departure as if they were going for a forest outing from their place. ||22|| At that time, eighteen crore Yadus, filled with immeasurable wealth, left Shauryapur. ||23|| Having obtained auspicious tithi, nakshatra, yoga, and vara, those noble kings, with small encampments, were on their way. ||24|| After crossing countless countries, as they were going towards the west, the vast Vindhya mountain came near them, that is, as they were going gradually, they reached near the Vindhya mountain. ||25|| It was beautiful with forests of elephants, full of lions and tigers, and its sky-touching peaks delighted the minds of the people. ||26||

Page #534:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, 

Upon hearing that Jarasandha was approaching, the Yadavas, filled with great enthusiasm, prepared to fight.  

Seeing a small distance between the two armies, the goddesses who resided in the land of Bharata, due to the workings of time and fate, manifested their divine power and created numerous pyres. They showed the enemy that the Yadavas were engulfed in flames. 

Jarasandha, whose body was enveloped in a multitude of flames, saw the burning army with its four divisions. 

His path blocked by the flames, Jarasandha halted his army and, assuming the form of an old woman, asked a weeping goddess, "O elder, whose vast encampment is burning so fiercely? And why are you weeping here? Tell me everything."

Her eyes filled with tears, her throat choked with grief, the old woman, despite her sorrow, managed to speak, "O valiant king, I will tell you what I have seen. For it is a common saying that one who expresses their grief to a great man is freed from even the greatest sorrow."

"There is a king named Jarasandha in the city of Rajagriha. He is a man of truth and justice, ruling the earth to the edge of the sea. It seems that his flames of prowess, fueled by the deceit of the great fire, burn even in the ocean to pacify his enemies."

"The Yadavas, burdened by their own sins and with hearts filled with fear, fled from Jarasandha. Finding no refuge anywhere in the world, they entered the fire, seeking the ultimate refuge of death, becoming free from their sins by burning in the flames."

"I am a servant, descended from the lineage of those kings. My life was dear to me, so I could not burn with them. But I weep in sorrow for the untimely death of my master."

Page #535:

## Chapter Forty

The Yadavas, Kauravas, and Bhojas, along with their subjects and ministers, had entered the fire. ||40|| But I, unfortunate one, am still alive, my body a vessel of sorrow, my heart filled with grief for their loss. I am like a creature possessed, gasping for breath. ||41|| Hearing the old woman's words, Jarasandha was astonished and believed her, thinking the lineage of the Andhakas and Vrishnis was destroyed. ||42|| He returned to his place and, with his relatives, performed the water offering for the deceased, feeling as if he had fulfilled his duty. ||43|| The Yadavas, following their own desires, went to the shore of the ocean, where the air was fragrant with the scent of cardamom vines. ||44|| They settled in distant lands near the western ocean, each king, subject, and minister finding their appropriate place. ||45||

**Shārdūlavikridita**

Jarasandha, cruel and enraged, followed the Yadavas relentlessly, determined to destroy them and die himself. But the path was blocked by flames, and he was forced to turn back. The Jains say that the auspicious rise of both of them is worth hearing. ||46||

Thus ends the fortieth chapter of the Harivamsha Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which is part of the collection of the Arishta-nemi Purana, and describes the departure of the Harivamsha and Yadavas. ||40||

## Chapter Forty-One

Driven by curiosity, the Kshatriyas, including Dasārha, Mahābhaja, Vṛṣṇi, Kṛṣṇa, and Nemijina, approached the tumultuous ocean.  ||1||

The ocean, like a maddened elephant, sported with its waves, its spray scattering in all directions. The fish, leaping and diving, seemed to open and close their eyes. ||2||

With its towering, restless waves, the ocean seemed to envy the vastness of the sky, striving to engulf it from all sides. ||3||

The Kshatriyas beheld the ocean, swirling with its mighty waves, teeming with fearsome crocodiles, and surrounded by makari-like elephants. ||4||

Like the ocean of Jain scriptures, which even with effort cannot be crossed, so too, this ocean remained unconquerable for those lacking the wisdom to build a vessel. Just as the ocean of Jain scriptures, due to its profound depth, cannot be transgressed, so too, this ocean, with its immense depth, remained impenetrable. ||5||

Like the ocean of Jain scriptures, adorned with magnificent waves and vast waters, so too, this ocean was filled with tides, waves, and foam.  ||6||

Like the ocean of Jain scriptures, a treasure trove of the supreme jewels of self-substance, right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, and the pearls of liberation, so too, this ocean was a repository of precious gems and pearls, imbued with the finest qualities.  ||7||

**8.**  The ocean, like the Jain scriptures, is a firm vow to protect all living beings, a path unchallenged by any victor.

**9.**  It dispels the endless suffering of those who seek refuge, not just through touch, but even through its mere presence.

**10.**  The kings, witnessing this ocean, felt immense joy, as if they had seen the ocean of scriptures revealed by the Jinas.

**11.**  The ocean, adorned with scattered flower garlands, swayed with its waves, echoing with the sound of conch shells, as if celebrating the arrival of Lord Neminath.

**12.**  Its waves, like hands, offered coral and pearls, its roaring voice a welcome to Krishna.

**13.**  The fish, leaping from the water, seemed to be paying homage to Lord Balarama, the chief of the Yuga, with their eyes.

**14.**  The ocean, with its foamy waves, seemed to be expressing its joy at the sight of the victorious kings, Akshobhya, Bhojak, and Vrishni.

**1.**  The ocean is *anadic* (without beginning), filled with water that has no equal.

In the Harivamsha Purana, on a most auspicious day, Krishna, desiring to obtain a place, performed the Ashtamabhakta, a three-day fast, along with his elder brother Balarama. ||15||  Thereafter, Krishna, the valiant and wise, who had performed the Panchaguru stotra, was resting on a bed of Daba, abiding by the rules, on the seashore. At that time, by the command of Saudharma Indra, a powerful god named Gotama arrived and swiftly removed the sea, which had been present there for a long time. ||16-17||  Then, by the merit of Vasudeva and the intense devotion of the Tirthankara, the great city of Dwaraka was created by Kubera. ||18||  This city was twelve yojanas long, nine yojanas wide, surrounded by a diamond wall, and enclosed by a moat of the sea. ||19||  Adorned with numerous multi-storied palaces made of jewels and gold, it blocked the sky and shone like the celestial city of Alakapuri, fallen from the heavens. ||20||  It was filled with ponds, pushkarinis, large tanks, lakes, and reservoirs, all covered with lotuses and blue lotuses, and filled with sweet water. ||21||  It was adorned with Kalpa trees, resembling radiant Kalpa creepers, and was filled with the best forests of betel, clove, and nutmeg. ||22||  There were large palaces with golden walls and gateways, and everywhere, floors of colorful jewels, giving pleasure to all. ||23||  With wide roads, interspersed with rest stops and water fountains, the city appeared very beautiful and was suitable for the residence of kings and all the people. ||24||  The city was adorned with tall Jain temples, made of all kinds of jewels, with walls, gateways, and gardens. ||25||  In the middle of this city, in the directions of the southeast, etc., the palaces of the ten brothers, starting with Samudravijaya, were shining. ||26||  In the midst of all these palaces, surrounded by Kalpa trees and creepers, was the eighteen-storied palace of Keshava, called Sarvatobhadra. ||27||  Rows of palaces suitable for the inner apartments and sons, etc., were shining around the palace of Shouri. ||28||

## Chapter Forty-One

**501.** The palace of Balarama, adorned with gardens and pools, was surrounded by rows of houses within the inner city. It shone brightly. **29.** In front of the palace, there was a magnificent assembly hall, resembling Indra's assembly hall, which outshone the rays of the sun. **30.** In that city, there were rows of magnificent palaces, fit for Ugrasena and the other kings, each with eight sections. **31.** Kubera, having created this divine city, with many gates, impossible to describe, presented it to Vasudeva. **32.** At that time, Kubera presented Vasudeva with a crown, a beautiful necklace, the Kaustubha gem, two yellow garments, a celestial garland, and other rare objects. **33.** He also gave him the mace Kumudvati, the spear, the sword Nandaka, the bow Shang, two quivers, and diamond arrows. **34.** He gave him a divine chariot, equipped with all weapons, with a Garuda flag, whisks, and a white umbrella. **35.** For Balarama, he gave two blue garments, a garland, a crown, a mace, a plough, a club, a bow, two quivers full of arrows, a divine chariot, complete with weapons, and a tall flag with a conch shell, along with an umbrella and other things. **36-37.** Kubera also honored the ten brothers, including Samudravijaya, and the kings like Bhoj, with garments, ornaments, and other gifts. **38.** The Tirthankara, Shri Neminatha, had already received worship with the best of things, befitting his status. What is the need for further description? **39.** Saying, "May you all enter the city," and sending a message to the Yaksha, Purnabhadra, Kubera disappeared in an instant. **40.** Then, the Yadava clan, on the shore of the ocean, celebrated the coronation of Krishna and Balarama, with joyous shouts of victory. **41.** Filled with joy, Krishna and Balarama, along with their people, who had accumulated merit, entered the magnificent city of Dwaraka, which was like heaven itself, with their four-armed forces. **42.** The people settled comfortably in the auspicious dwellings, as instructed by the Yaksha, Purnabhadra, each in their own place. **43.**

In the Harivamsha Purana, the residents of Mathura, Suryapur, and Viryapura, just like before, settled down in their respective neighborhoods with their families, finding contentment. ||44|| As per Kubera's command, the Yakshas showered the entire city with inexhaustible wealth, grains, and other riches for three and a half days. ||45|| When Krishna resided there, the kings of the west, subdued by his prowess, became obedient to his rule. ||46|| The Lord of Dwaraka, Krishna, then married thousands of daughters from thousands of kings and enjoyed himself there as he pleased. ||47||
There, Nemikumar, like a young moon, grew day by day, his body being the abode of all arts. ||48|| Nemikumar, the young sun, whose rise caused the lotus-like faces of the Yadavas to bloom, and whose radiance dispelled the darkness, was resplendent. ||49|| Increasing the strength and joy of Balarama and Krishna every day, Nemikumar, in his childhood, engaged in playful activities that captivated the eyes and minds of the city dwellers. ||50|| The Lord Nemnath, adorned with extraordinary beauty, reached the age of youth, adorning the hands of all the Yadava women with his touch. ||51|| No woman could divert her gaze from the young Nemikumar, whose body was marked by numerous auspicious signs and whose eyes were like blue lotuses. ||52|| The arrow of the Lord's form pierced the hearts of the beings of the world from afar, but their hearts were not pierced by the arrows of other forms. Meaning: Even when youth manifested, the Lord's heart was not affected by the influence of lust. ||53|| Since there was no comparison or equal to the Lord's form on earth, Indra was distressed about finding a comparison and a comparable object for the Lord's form. ||54|| When his relatives discussed his marriage during their playful activities, Nemijinenadra, with a faint smile, felt embarrassed himself. ||55|| The Lord's inner being, cleansed of the stain of delusion by the water of the three knowledges, was not clouded by the dust of worldly wealth. ||56||

Forty-first Chapter
Shālinī Chanda
'By the Jains, the Vāṇavas, the Vaiṣṇavas, and the Maddeśacandrāloka-prakataiḥ, the groups of good qualities,
'The meaning is clear, the people are delighted, the waves are like the ocean, the Dwārakā is beautiful. ||5||'
Thus, in the Harivamśa, composed by Jinaseṇācārya, in the collection of the Ariṣṭanemi Purāṇa, the description of the establishment of Dwārakā
is called the Forty-first Chapter. ||35||
Gautama Svāmī says that Dwārikāpuri, which was touched by the light of the moon, which was manifested by the groups of excellent qualities of Nemijinenndra, Bhojak Vṛṣṇi, Kṛṣṇa, and Balabhadra, in which people were jumping like waves with joy, and which was beautiful from the gates, was being adorned by the sea like a garland. ||57||
Thus ends the Forty-first Chapter of the Harivamśa Purāṇa, composed by Jinaseṇācārya, which is a collection of the Ariṣṭanemi Purāṇa, which describes Dwārikāpuri. ||4||
1. Related to Nemijina. 2. These are the Vṛṣṇis. 3. These are the Vaiṣṇavas, related to Viṣṇu, i.e., Śrī Kṛṣṇa. 4. These are the Balabhadra, related to Balabhadra. 5. The meaning is clear. 6. Dwāra is beautiful.

## Chapter Forty-Two

Then, the celestial sage Narada, who travels through the skies, descended from the heavens and entered the assembly of the Yadavas, which was filled with noblemen. ||1||

Narada's matted hair, beard, and mustache were somewhat yellowish, and he himself possessed the brilliance of the moon. Therefore, he appeared like a cloud of the autumn season adorned with a cluster of lightning. ||2||

He was adorned with a wide, colorful yoga-patta, and thus he seemed to possess the splendor of the moon, which is surrounded by a halo. ||3||

His loincloth and upper garment were gently swaying in the breeze, making him appear as if the Kalpa tree itself had descended from the heavens out of a desire to benefit the world. ||4||

He was radiant with the three virtues of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, which were embodied in the pure sacred thread worn on his body. ||5||

He was adorned with extraordinary scholarship and the extraordinary cause of his greatness, namely, lifelong celibacy. ||6||

He was worthy of being worshipped by all kings, just as a prosperous kingdom is worthy of being worshipped. For, just as a prosperous kingdom is characterized by a pure nature, free from corruption, and ministers of pure character, so too was Narada characterized by a pure nature, free from any blemish. And just as a prosperous kingdom is free from the six enemies of the state, so too was Narada free from the six internal enemies: lust, anger, greed, delusion, pride, and envy. ||7||

Seeing the splendor of Dwarka, their heads and bodies trembled in awe. Upon seeing Narada descend from the heavens, all the kings immediately stood up. ||8||

They honored Narada, who was content with mere respect, with prostrations, offerings of seats, and other courtesies in a proper manner. ||9||

Having drunk the nectar of happiness born from the sight and conversation of Nemijineendra, Krishna, and Balabhadra, Narada, whose eyes were still not satisfied, stood in the midst of the assembly, like an ocean. ||10||

He then delighted the minds of the assembly with the nectar of stories about the Jinas, the Tirthankaras who had arisen in the eastern and western regions of the world, stories that were like the rising sun of Mount Meru. ||11||

The Thirty-Fourth Chapter
105
In the preface, the chief of the Ganadhara, Shranika, asked this: "O Lord! Who is this Narada, and from where is his origin?" [12]
Ganadhara replied: "Listen, O Shranika, I shall tell you about the origin and status of the Antyadehika (one with the last body) Narada. [13]

There was an Ashrama of the ascetics (Tapasas) in the south, at the end of the city of Saurya. The ascetics residing there lived on fruits, roots, etc. [14] There, an ascetic named Sumitra, who lived on Ucchvritta (gleaning), had a wife named Somayasha. He begot a son in her, who was as radiant as the moon. [15]

When the child was lying down, the two, being hungry and thirsty, came to the city for the purpose of Ucchvritta. Meanwhile, the Jambuka devas, out of affection from the previous birth, saw the child, took him to the Vaitadya mountain, and placed him in a gem-and-gold cave. There, they nourished the child with the divine food from the Kalpavrikshas (wish-fulfilling trees). [16-18]

The devas, being pleased with him, gave him the secret Jinagama (Jain scriptures) and the Akashagamini Vidya (the knowledge of flying in the sky) when he was eight years old. [19] 

This Narada became well-versed in many sciences and skilled in various scriptures. Through the association of the Sadhus (ascetics), he attained Samyamasanyama (partial control and lack of control). [20]

Though he had conquered Kandarpya (the god of love), he was not deluded by Kandarpya. He was dear to those with Kandarpya (the lustful), yet he was free from the playfulness of laughter and the charm of hair. [21]

Though he was Antyadehika (one with the last body) by nature and free from passions, he was mostly inclined towards witnessing battles. He was often the chief among the talkative. [22]

Out of curiosity, he roams the world, marveling at the great events of the Jina's birth, consecration, and other such extraordinary occurrences. [23]

Harivamsha Purana
O King! This is the same Narada who, after inquiring from the Yadavas, entered the inner palace to see Keshava's inner apartments. ||24|| There, he saw Vishnu's Mahadevi, Satyabhama, who was dearer to him than life itself, adorned with ornaments and looking at her reflection in a jewel-studded mirror held in her hand. Narada saw the virtuous lady from a distance. She appeared like the very embodiment of desire in front of his eyes. ||25-26|| The sage, whose mind was distracted by the sight of her beauty, did not see Narada. She was instantly angered and quickly left the place. ||27|| He thought to himself, "In this world, all the Vidyadharas, Bhucharas, kings, and women of their inner apartments rise and salute me. But this daughter of a Vidyadhara, Satyabhama, is so arrogant that she did not even look at me in her pride of beauty. Shame on her!" ||28-29|| "Now, I will crush her mountain of beauty, good fortune, and pride with the thunderbolt of a rival wife." ||30|| "Krishna can easily get another wife who surpasses Satyabhama in beauty and good fortune, for this earth is adorned with many jewels." ||31|| "When she sees me, I will see her face stained with the breath of her sighs. How can she escape misfortune when I, Narada, am angry?" ||32|| Thinking thus, Narada flew up into the sky and reached the city of Kundina, where the great king Bhishma, who was terrible to his enemies, resided. ||33|| His son, Rukmi, was a man of great policy and valor, and he had a beautiful daughter named Rukmini, who was skilled in the arts and virtues. ||34|| Narada, whose heart was pure, saw Rukmini in the inner apartments of King Bhishma. She was like the rising sun, adorned with the glow of love, and she was loved by her maternal aunt. ||35|| She seemed to have been created by the great merits of Hari, possessing the best of auspicious signs, beauty, and good fortune, which were spread throughout the three worlds. ||36|| She was beautiful with her hands, feet, lotus-like face, thighs, and full hips, and her body was adorned with the beauty of her hair, arms, navel, breasts, belly, and waist. ||37||

The Forty-second Sarga
507 Her eyebrows, head, neck, nose, and lips were all captivating. She surpassed all comparisons and stood supreme in the world. \\38\\ Seeing her, the eminent Narada was amazed and contemplated, "Ah! This maiden is the epitome of beauty on earth." \\39\\ Uniting this unparalleled maiden with Krishna, I shall destroy the arrogance of Satyabhama's beauty and fortune," he thought. \\40\\ Seeing Narada thus absorbed in contemplation, Rukminī, endowed with natural modesty, rose up. \\41\\ With folded hands, she reverentially approached and greeted him, and he, by virtue of being the husband of the mistress of Dvaraka, blessed her with humility. \\42\\ Questioned by her, Narada narrated the glories of Dvaraka, and Rukminī became deeply devoted to Krishna. \\43\\ The painter Narada then drew Krishna's portrait on a canvas, capturing his form, complexion, and age, and departed. \\44\\ He meticulously depicted Rukminī's wondrous beauty on the canvas and took it to show Krishna, the cause of bewilderment. \\45\\ Seeing the maiden depicted on the canvas, dark-complexioned and endowed with feminine characteristics, Krishna, filled with double reverence, asked Narada, \\46\\ "O Lord! Whose is this remarkable maiden you have painted on the canvas? She seems to surpass even divine maidens in beauty." \\47\\ Questioned thus, Narada truthfully narrated the entire incident. Hearing this, Krishna also became concerned about obtaining the maiden. \\48\\ At an opportune time, out of compassion, the aunt (Kunti) informed him, "This is Rukminī," revealing all the details. \\49\\ "O child! Listen to my words. Once, the all-knowing Atimukta Muni, endowed with divine vision, had come here and, upon seeing you, had said..." \\50\\

In the Harivamsha Purana, Krishna, accompanied by Bhima and Bhishma, informed Rukmini about the abduction of Rukmini. He then urged his chariot forward.  ||78||  Krishna then blew his Panchajanya conch, which reverberated throughout the directions, while Balarama blew his conch, the Sugosha, causing the enemy army to tremble. ||79||  Upon receiving the news, Rukmi and Shishupala, both valiant warriors, swiftly mounted their chariots and rushed towards Krishna and Balarama. ||80||  They were accompanied by sixty thousand chariots, ten thousand elephants, three hundred thousand horses, and countless foot soldiers armed with swords, discs, bows, and arrows. They engulfed the remaining directions, approaching Krishna and Balarama. ||81-82||  Meanwhile, Krishna, seated comfortably in his chariot, comforted Rukmini, pointing out the villages, fields, lakes, and rivers as they progressed slowly. ||83||  Seeing the approaching formidable army, Rukmini, with eyes like a doe, expressed her fear to Krishna, saying, "My enraged brother, the great warrior Rukmi, and Shishupala are approaching. I fear for my well-being." ||84-85||  "With such vast armies on their side, I doubt your victory in this great battle against them. Alas, I am indeed unfortunate." ||86-87||  Krishna, hearing her words, reassured her, saying, "Fear not, my dear. While I, the valiant one, stand here, what can the multitude of others do?" ||87||  Having said this, Krishna, the master of extraordinary weapons, effortlessly severed a nearby palm tree with his arrow. ||88||  He then crushed the diamond embedded in his ring with his hand, completely dispelling her doubts. ||89||  Rukmini, recognizing her husband's power, folded her hands and said, "My Lord, my brother must be protected by you in this battle." ||90||

## Chapter Forty-Two

Having calmed his frightened beloved, Hari and Hali turned their chariots towards the enemy with great speed.  ||91||  The enemy army, enraged and attacked by a shower of arrows from the two, was scattered and destroyed, its arrogance shattered. ||92||  Like a lion in battle, Hari, the fierce, confronted Shishupala, while Hali, the king, with the might of Bhishma, faced Bhishma's son, Rukmi. ||93||  In a duel, Shishupala's head was severed by a distant arrow, shot with great skill and glory by Vishnu. ||94||  Hali, having shattered Rukmi's chariot, left him with only his life remaining, and then, with Krishna, departed. ||95||  Having married Rukmini on Mount Raivataka, Hari, filled with divine power, entered the city with his brother. ||96||  Eager to see Revati, Hali entered his own home, while Krishna, with his bow in hand, entered his own, accompanied by his new bride. ||97||

**Earth's Desire**

Seeing the deeds of Hari, who had crushed the wheels of countless chariots, vanquished the pride of conquering kings, and slain Shishupala in battle, the sun, fearing his own capture, contracted his body, though he was sharp with a thousand rays, and entered the cave of the setting sun. ||98||  Just as the dawn, filled with love, had followed the sun, the bearer of great glory, with intense love, and had made herself red with love, so too, the evening, now red like a kusumbha flower, showed her devotion to the sun, even though his wealth of rays had been lost. ||99|| 

**Meaning:**  Even though the sun was filled with great glory, he still held love for me.

Hariwamsha Purana

Then, as if under the influence of the powerful winds of delusion, the world was quickly enveloped by the dense darkness of sins, like being covered by wicked people. (100)

The moon, whose radiance was like nectar, quickly dispelled the abundant darkness, as if being eagerly drunk by the eyes of the people. This moon, which ignites the passion in the world and alleviates the heat born of the sun, arose for the happiness of the happy ones. (101)

At that time, the blossoming of the moon's rays along with all the creatures of the world, including those separated from their beloved, occurred. But alas, the lotuses, inflamed by separation, did not delight the distressed ones. (102)

Then, at the time of dusk, the Yadavas, whose wives were robbed of their pride, engaged in the attainment of the wealth of conjugal bliss. They embraced their lovely female companions in the palaces illuminated by the moonlight as white as nectar. (103)

Even Murari (Krishna), for a long time, delighted in union with the creeper-like Rukmin??. At night, he slept on a soft bed, experiencing the happiness of sleep obtained by the touch of her hidden, delicate limbs, breasts and face. (104)

Then, the night, undivided in its entirety, was marked by the melodious chirping of the various crested cocks, who, in a gradual and graceful manner, announced the approach of dawn. (105)

In this way, with the first understanding, just as the auspicious dawn, Hari (Krishna), awakened, gazed upon the goddess (Rukmin??) who was bowed down, her fragrance radiating from the contact of love. (106)

**513**

Dwārikā, resounding with the booming drums of dawn, the conch shells, the sweet music, and the deep roar of the ocean, like the thunder of clouds.  Every house, every home, awoke, the king and his people, each fulfilling their duties as they should.  ||10||

The sun, rising, swiftly removed the darkness created by others, and joined together what had been separated by others.  He was extremely clever, capable, the bright and ever-wakeful eye of the world, like the path of the Jina's words, or like the Creator himself.  ||108||

Thus ends the forty-second chapter of the Harivamsha Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, a part of the Arishta-nemi Purana, describing the abduction of Rukmini.  ||42||

**Notes:**

* **Jina:** A Jain Tirthankara, a spiritual teacher.
* **Jina's words:** The teachings of the Jain Tirthankaras.

The thirty-third chapter describes the visit of Satyabhāmā to Rukmiṇī's palace, which was filled with various opulences. Lord Viṣṇu gave Rukmiṇī a divine palace along with attendants, vehicles, and other paraphernalia befitting her status as the queen. Knowing that Lord Kṛṣṇa was extremely fond of Rukmiṇī, Satyabhāmā, though feeling jealous, engaged Him in various pastimes with great patience. One day, Kṛṣṇa secretly brought the betel nut chewed by Rukmiṇī to Satyabhāmā's palace, and Satyabhāmā, mistaking it for a fragrant object, applied it to her body. Seeing this, Kṛṣṇa laughed, which made Satyabhāmā angry. Knowing Kṛṣṇa's affection for Rukmiṇī, Satyabhāmā became eager to see her beauty. She requested Kṛṣṇa to show her Rukmiṇī, and Kṛṣṇa, keeping some secret, took Satyabhāmā to the bank of a jeweled pond where Rukmiṇī was standing. Kṛṣṇa then sent Satyabhāmā ahead, while He hid Himself in the bushes. There, Satyabhāmā saw Rukmiṇī standing on the bank of the pond, holding on to a mango tree with one hand. Satyabhāmā then approached Rukmiṇī and touched her breasts with her left hand.

Seeing Rukmini, who was adorned like a goddess, Satyabhāma thought, "This is a goddess," and offered her a garland of flowers. Falling at her feet, she prayed for her own good fortune and the misfortune of her rival, who was stained with the poison of jealousy. || 13-14 ||

In the meantime, Hari, with a playful smile, said to Satyabhāma, "Ah! This is an unprecedented meeting of two sisters, full of virtue." || 15 ||

Hearing this, Satyabhāma, who knew the truth and was full of anger, said, "What is it to you, O Hari? What do you want from this meeting of ours?" || 16 ||

Then, accepting Krishna's words, Rukmini bowed to Satyabhāma with humility. It is said that humility is innate in those born of noble lineage. || 17 ||

After spending a long time in the garden, adorned with arbors, Krishna, accompanied by the two queens, returned to his palace. || 18 ||

As many days passed like one for Krishna, who was immersed in the ocean of happiness and adorned with valor, one day, Duryodhana, the king of Hastinapur, sent his messenger to Krishna with great affection. Driven by his love for wealth, the king of Hastinapur said, "Whoever is born first among your queens, Rukmini and Satyabhāma, if a daughter is born to me, she will marry that son." || 19-21 ||

Hearing the messenger's words, Krishna was delighted and honored him before sending him away. The messenger then reported the success of his mission to his master. || 22 ||

Upon hearing this news, Satyabhāma sent her messengers to Rukmini. They fell at Rukmini's feet and said, "O mistress! Our mistress, Satyabhāma, has some excellent words for you. O virtuous one! Like an ornament, hold these praiseworthy words in your ears - listen to them. The words are these: 'It is decided that whoever's son is born first among us two, he will marry Duryodhana's promising daughter. At the time of that marriage, whoever's son..."

In the Harivamsha Purana, it is said that the bride and groom will bathe after placing the severed hair of the bride under their feet. This act is highly auspicious and brings fame. Therefore, O glorious one, O fortunate one, O Ayē, if you find this agreeable, then grant your permission. ||26-27||

Hearing these words, which were like nectar to her ears, Rukmini was pleased and said, "So be it." Then, the messengers went and informed their mistress, Satyabhama. ||28||

After the fourth bath, Rukmini was lying down on her bed at night when she dreamt of riding a swan chariot through the sky. ||29||

Upon waking, she told her husband, Lord Krishna, about her dream. In response, he said, "You will have a great son who will travel through the sky." ||30||

Hearing her husband's words, Rukmini, like a lotus touched by the rays of the morning sun, blossomed with joy. ||31||

Then, to bring supreme joy to both Lord Upendra and his people, Achyute Indra descended from heaven and entered Rukmini's womb. ||32||

At the same time, Satyabhama, having bathed her head, also conceived a son from heaven, as a result of a good dream. ||33||

These two growing wombs, with their increasing fame, brought immense joy to their mothers and father. ||34||

When the month of delivery arrived, Rukmini gave birth to a son with all the marks of a great man. On the same night, Satyabhama also gave birth to a son. ||35||

Both queens sent messengers, who were well-wishers and bearers of good news, to Lord Krishna at the same time during the night. As Krishna was sleeping, the messenger sent by Satyabhama stood near his head, while the messenger sent by Rukmini stood near his feet. ||36||

When Krishna awoke, his eyes first fell upon the messenger standing near his feet. He was pleased to hear the news of Rukmini's son's birth and, as a reward for bringing good fortune, he gave him a jewel from his own body. ||37||

Then, turning his head, Krishna saw the messengers sent by Satyabhama. They praised him, and...

Chapter Thirty-Four

517. At that very moment, a powerful Asura named Dhumketu, riding in his celestial chariot, approached Rukmini's palace, his chariot resembling a comet. ||39||

His chariot came to a sudden halt, causing him to be momentarily astonished. Looking down, his eyes, which possessed the knowledge of destruction, beheld Rukmini's son. ||40||

Upon seeing the child, his anger flared, his eyes turning crimson, fueled by the fire of his past enmity. ||41||

He then plunged all the guards, the family members, and even Rukmini herself into a deep slumber, and lifting the child in his arms, as if he were a mountain, the dark-hued Asura, known for his foolish mind, soared into the sky. ||42-43||

As he flew, he pondered, "Should I crush this former enemy of mine with my hands? Or should I tear him apart with my claws and scatter his remains for the birds in the sky? Or should I drop this insignificant foe into the vast ocean, filled with fearsome sharks and crocodiles? Or is this just a lump of flesh? What good is killing him? If I leave him here, unprotected, he will die on his own." ||44-46||

Thus, contemplating the child's good fortune, the Asura continued his journey, spotting the Khadir forest in the distance. He descended and placed the child beneath the Takshashila mountain, then, resembling a comet, he vanished swiftly. ||47-48||

Shortly after, the king of Meghakoota, Kalasambara, accompanied by his queen Kanakmala, was traversing the skies in his celestial chariot, surveying the earth. But the child's influence brought his chariot to a standstill. ||49-50||

"What is this?" he wondered, filled with astonishment. Descending, he saw a large, moving rock. ||51||

He pushed the rock aside and beheld a body, unharmed, radiating the brilliance of Kamadeva, the god of love. ||52||

Krishna, pleased by the news of Satyabhama's childbirth, showered her with gifts. ||38||

Taking the child, filled with compassion, he was ready to give it to his beloved. "Your son is not your son, take this one," said Priyamvada. ||53|| Extending her hands, she then drew them back, the wise, far-seeing Khechari, as if unwilling. ||54|| "Beloved, what is this?" asked he. She replied, "You have five hundred sons, born of noble lineage." ||55|| "If those arrogant ones, unaware of his lineage, were to strike him on the head, I would not be able to bear the sight. It is better for me to remain childless." ||56|| Having thus spoken, he comforted her, took the golden ear-ring, and said, "This is the prince," and tied a band around his arm. ||57|| Then, pleased, the wise Kankamala took the child. The two, with their son, entered the great city of Meghakoot. ||58|| The great queen Kankamala, who had conceived in secret, gave birth to a noble son. Thus, the wise Kalasambar, the lord of time, made this announcement in the city. ||59|| He celebrated the birth of this treasure of merit with dancing groups of Vidyaadharis, their anklets jingling. ||60|| Because he had the brilliance of gold, he was named Pradyumna. The prince grew there, served by hundreds of young Vidyaadharas. ||61|| Meanwhile, in Dwaricapuri, when Rukmini awoke, she did not see her son. Then, with the old nurses, she searched everywhere, but when her efforts were unsuccessful, she cried out loud, "Alas, my son! Who has taken you away? Why has fate shown me this treasure and then taken it away? Surely, in another life, I must have separated a woman from her son, for without a cause, how could I receive such a fruit?" ||62-64|| As Rukmini lamented thus, her family also wept, and a loud sound of weeping arose. ||65|| 1.

## Chapter Thirty-Four

Then, knowing the whole story, Vasudeva, along with his relatives and other beautiful women, arrived there quickly. Hearing the sound of weeping, Balarama also arrived. Holding his Nandaka sword, Krishna began to criticize his own strength and his carelessness. || 66-67 ||

Speaking with great wisdom, Krishna said, "In the world, fate is the supreme power, not human effort. This baseless human effort is to be condemned. || 68 || Otherwise, how could my son, Vasudeva, adorned with the shining edge of a drawn sword, be defeated by others?" || 69 ||

Speaking much in this way, Krishna said to Rukmini, "My dear, do not grieve too much. Be patient, O patient one! || 70 || The son who has fallen from heaven, born to you and me, is not ordinary. He must surely enjoy the pleasures of this world. || 71 || Therefore, just as a person with sharp vision searches for the subtle image of the moon in the sky, I will search for your son, who brings joy to the eyes of the people, everywhere in the world. || 72 ||

Thus, comforting Rukmini, whose cheeks were washed with tears, Madhava became determined to find his son. || 73 ||

At that time, Narada, who was always engaged in his endeavors, arrived there to see Krishna. Hearing the news, he was momentarily stunned with grief. || 74 || He saw the faces of the Yadavas, all withered like lotus flowers scorched by frost, with great astonishment. || 75 ||

Then, calming his anger, Narada said to Janardana, "O hero! Give up this grief, I will bring news of your son. || 76 || The sage Ati-Muktaka, who was a knower of liberation, has attained Nirvana, having obtained the eye of pure knowledge. || 77 || And Nemikumar, who possesses the three kinds of knowledge, knows but will not speak. We do not know why he will not speak. || 78 || Therefore, I will go to the region of Videha and ask the Jina, Simandhara, about your son and bring you the news." || 79 ||

Having received Krishna's reply, Narada left and went to Rukmini's palace. Seeing her lotus-like face, scorched by the fire of grief, || 80 ||

Harivamsha Purana
Though grief-stricken, he maintained his composure outwardly.  He rose and honored her, then sat down near her. ||41|| Seeing him, who was like her father, Rukmini cried out, her voice choked with sorrow.  In the presence of the virtuous, even old grief feels new. ||82|| As if to calm the ocean of her sorrow, the wise Narada, with a cheerful heart, spoke to her. ||83|| "Rukmini, abandon your grief! Your son lives somewhere.  Perhaps he was taken away by some enemy from a previous life. ||84|| The very fact that he was born to you, a devotee of Vasudeva, indicates the long life of that great soul. ||85||  In this world, dear child, unions and separations are inevitable for all beings, bringing happiness and sorrow. ||86|| But for those who understand the power of karma and have their eyes opened by knowledge, these unions and separations do not have the power of enemies, as they do for the Yadavas. ||87|| You, who know the truth of the Jina's teachings and the nature of the world, should not be overcome by grief.  I will soon bring news of your son. ||88|| Having thus consoled the slender Rukmini with these words of nectar, Narada flew up into the sky and went to the presence of the Jina, Simandhar. ||89|| There, in the city of  Pundarika, in the land of Pushkalavati, he saw Simandhar, the Jina, worshipped by men, gods, and demons. ||90|| With folded hands and uttering a pure hymn of praise, he bowed to the Jina and then sat down among the kings. ||91|| At that time, the Chakravarti, Padma-ratha, was seated there, his chariot rising to a height of five hundred bows.  Seeing Narada, who was praised by men and stood ten bows tall, he was curious and, lifting him up with his lotus-like hands, asked the Lord, "O Master, what is this creature, shaped like a man, and what is his name?" ||92-93|| Then Simandhar, the Jina, revealed the truth.  He said, "This is Narada, who is devoted to the welfare of the ninth Narayana, in the land of Bharat, on the Jambudvipa." ||94||

Chapter Thirty-Four

The Chakravarti asked, "Why has this one come, O Lord?"  The Dharmachakra Pravarttaka, Simandhar Bhagwan, explained everything to the Chakravarti from the beginning. He also said that the boy's name is Pradyumna. He will attain sixteen laabh (benefits) when he reaches the age of sixteen and will reunite with his parents.  His prowess will shine brightly, illuminated by the Mahavidya Prajnapti.  He will be invincible to all the gods on this earth.  

The Chakravarti asked, "O Lord, what is Pradyumna's character? And why was he defeated?"  In the presence of Narada, Simandhar Jinendra explained Pradyumna's character to the Chakravarti.

In the Magadha country, in the Bharat Kshetra, there lived a Brahmin named Somadev in the village of Shaligram.  His wife, Agnila, was like the Swaha of Agni, bringing him great happiness.  They had two sons, Agnibhuti and Vayubhuti.  

Both sons became very knowledgeable in the Vedas and their meanings.  They overshadowed the brilliance of other Brahmins and shone like Shukra and Brihaspati.  They were proud of their birth and the knowledge of the Vedas, they were talkative and flattering, and they were raised by their parents to be devoted to pleasure.  When they reached the age of sixteen, they considered women to be heaven and they hated the stories of the afterlife.

Later, a great Guru named Nandivardhan, who had crossed the ocean of knowledge, arrived with a large sangha (group) and stayed in a garden outside Shaligram.  Seeing them, the two Brahmin sons, free from any anxiety, asked the reason for their arrival.  

A simple Brahmin explained to them that a large sangha of monks had arrived and they were going to pay their respects.  Hearing this, the two sons thought, "Who on earth is more worthy of respect than us? Let's go see his greatness."  Filled with pride, they went towards the garden.

522
The sage with the eye of knowledge, the great sage Nandivardhana, was standing in the midst of the ocean of people, preaching the Dharma.  Two Brahmanas approached him.  Satyaki, the sage with the eye of knowledge, who was concerned for the welfare of the listeners, said, "May these two not be an obstacle to the hearing of the Dharma, like buffaloes."  He called out to the two Brahmanas from afar, "O Brahmanas, come here!"  They came and sat in front of him. ||108-110||

Seeing the two arrogant Brahmanas sitting in front of the sage Satyaki, the people filled the space in front of him, like a great river overflowing with water during the rainy season.  The people were drawn to the sage by their curiosity. ||111||

Then the sage said, "Learned ones, where have you come from?"  The Brahmanas replied, "Do you not know? We have come from Shaliagrama." ||112||

Satyaki said, "Yes, it is true that you have come from Shaliagrama, but tell me, in this endless, timeless world, how did you come here?" ||113||

The Brahmanas said, "This is difficult to understand, even for us, let alone others."  The sage said, "No, Brahmanas, listen, I will tell you." ||114||

"In your previous birth, you two were jackals, living near the boundary of this very village, and you were very fond of each other." ||115||

"In this village, there lived a farmer named Pravaraka.  One day, he was plowing his field and was feeling carefree, when a heavy downpour began, accompanied by a strong wind.  He was greatly distressed, his body trembled, and he was tormented by hunger.  He left his leather equipment near a banyan tree and went home." ||116-117||

"The rain continued for seven days and nights, destroying all living beings.  The two jackals, driven by hunger, ate the farmer's wet equipment." ||118||

"After some time, they suffered unbearable pain from a severe stomach ache.  Due to their karma, they were bound to a long lifespan." ||119||

Page #561:
---------------------------
## Chapter Thirty-Four

Having spent time in youth, you two, born into a lineage of pride, became Agnibhuti and Marubhuti, the sons of Somadev. ||120||

Due to the ripening of evil, beings experience misery, and due to the ripening of virtue, they attain happiness. Therefore, pride in lineage is futile. ||121||

When the farmer arrived at his field after the rains ceased, he saw the two dead jackals and brought them home. He had them made into a pair of shoes and felt content. Those shoes remain in his house even today. ||122||

He too, having become proud due to his son's son, became like a god of love, remembering his lineage. He remained silent like a mute, falsely. ||123||

"He is sitting among his relatives, looking at me intently," said Satyaki, the truthful one, calling the mute to him. ||124||

"You are that Brahmin farmer, the son of your son. Now, release yourself from sorrow and muteness, and speak the nectar of words, bringing joy to your relatives." ||125||

In this world, like actors, there is a reversal of roles between master and servant, father and son, mother and wife. ||126||

This world is like a complex and intricate network of clocks, where beings constantly wander, experiencing ups and downs. ||127||

"Therefore, my son, knowing this world as a vast and terrifying ocean, practice the essence of vows, rooted in compassion." ||128||

Having witnessed this direct revelation, the Brahmin fell at the feet of the sage, circumambulating him. ||129||

His eyes filled with tears of joy, he stood up, amazed, and with folded hands, spoke in a choked voice. ||130||

"Oh, you are like the omniscient one, the Lord of truth! Sitting here, you clearly perceive the true nature of things in all three realms." ||131||

"My mind's eye, clouded by the veil of ignorance, has been opened by you, my Lord, with the salve of knowledge." ||132||

In the beginning, in the forest of existence, enveloped in the darkness of great delusion, I was wandering, O Muni! You are my guide, my true friend. ||133||
Be pleased, O Bhagavan! Grant me the Daigambari initiation. ||134||
Having pleased the Guru and approached him, that wise Brahmin received the Daigambari initiation, which is desired by the virtuous. ||134||
Hearing and seeing the character of that Brahmin, some attained the state of Muni, while others attained the highest state of Shravaka. ||135||
Agnibhuiti and Vayubhuiti, ashamed of their past lives, were condemned by the people. They silently returned to their home, where their parents also rebuked them. ||136||
At night, Satyaki Muni was sitting in a secluded place in the Kayotsarga posture. Agnibhuiti and Vayubhuiti, with swords in their hands, wanted to kill him, but the Yaksha held them fast, so they stood there with their swords raised. ||137||
In the morning, people saw them standing near the Muni and condemned them, saying, "These are the wicked Brahmins who have committed sinful deeds." ||138||
Agnibhuiti and Vayubhuiti thought, "Look at the great influence of the Muni! By his power, we have been involuntarily held fast and have become like pillars." ||139||
They also resolved in their minds, "If we are somehow freed from this suffering, we will surely embrace the Jain Dharma, for we have seen its power firsthand." ||140||
At that time, hearing of their suffering, their parents rushed to the Muni and fell at his feet, trying to please him. ||141||
The compassionate Muni, having completed his yoga, sat down and, knowing that this was done by the Kshetrapal, said to him with humility, "O Yaksha! Forgive them for their wrongdoing, which arose from their own actions. Be merciful to these two beings who are driven by their karma." ||142-143||
Thus, having received the command of the Muni, like a king's command, the Kshetrapal said, "As you command," and released them. ||144||

Chapter Thirty-Four: Having met the Muni, they heard the two-fold Dharma and, gathering the Anuvratas, they attained the status of Shravaka. ||145|| Not adhering to the Dharma, yet imbued with the feeling of Samyak Darshan, they, in due time, attained the Dharma of their time, and became residents of Saudharma. ||146|| Their parents, not having faith in the Jain Dharma, were deluded by Mithyatva and, upon death, became wanderers on the path of the evil realms. ||147|| The beings, Agnibhuti and Vayubhuti, who had become Devas in Saudharma heaven, having enjoyed the pleasures of heaven, fell from there and were born as sons of Dharini, the wife of the wealthy merchant, Samudradatt, who resided in Ayodhya. ||148|| The elder son was named Purnabhadra and the younger son was named Manibhadra. In this cycle, too, both of them did not violate Samyaktv, and both were devoted to the Jin-Shasana. ||149|| In due time, their father, the king of Ayodhya, and other noble beings, having heard the Dharma from the Guru, Mahendrasena, took Jin-Diksha. ||150|| Once, Purnabhadra and Manibhadra, riding in a chariot, were going from the city for Muni Puja, when they saw a Chandala and a dog and felt affection for them. ||151|| Going to the Muni Raja, they bowed to him with devotion. Then, filled with wonder, they asked, "O Master! Why did we feel affection for the dog and the Chandala?" ||152|| The Muni Raja, who knew the state of the three worlds through Avadhigyan, said, "Your parents in the Brahman birth were these dog and Chandala. Therefore, you feel affection for them due to your past birth." ||153|| Hearing this, and bowing to the Muni Raja, the two brothers went to the dog and the Chandala. There, they preached Dharma to them and told them the story of their past birth, which calmed them both. ||154|| The Chandala, becoming detached from the world, renounced his lowliness and gave up all four types of food. He took a month's renunciation, died, and became a Deva in the Nandishwar island. ||155|| The dog was born as the daughter of the king in the same city. The princess's Swayamvara was taking place. At the time when she was standing in the Swayamvara, the aforementioned Nandishwar Deva...

In the Harivamsha Purana, a princess who had realized the futility of worldly life and was imbued with the spirit of right faith (Samyaktv) took initiation at a young age, wearing a white sari. ||157||
Her two brothers, Purnabhadra and Manibhadra, performed the excellent and supreme vows of a Shravak for a long time and finally attained the supreme state of the Saudharma heaven through Sallekhana. ||158||
After their descent from heaven, they were born as sons named Madhu and Kaitabha to the queen Dharavati of King Hemnabh of Ayodhya. ||159||
Later, Madhu was crowned king and Kaitabha was made the yuvaraja. The great king Hemnabh took Jain initiation. ||160||
Madhu and Kaitabha were unparalleled heroes on earth. They possessed extraordinary brilliance, like the sun and the moon. ||161||
A fearsome king named Bhimaka, who was like darkness and could not be subdued by petty vassals, took refuge in a mountain fortress and stood against Madhu and Kaitabha. To subdue him, the two brothers set out. On their journey, they reached the city of Vatapura, where King Virasena resided. ||162-163||
King Virasena, filled with joy, welcomed Madhu with great respect and honored him with his entire inner court, motivated by devotion to his master. ||164||
King Virasena had a wife named Chandrabha, who was beautiful like the moon and dignified. Chandrabha, who spoke sweetly, captivated the heart of King Madhu. ||165||
Just as a very hard Chandrakant stone becomes moist upon seeing the moon, so too, despite being hardened by the study of weapons and scriptures, Madhu's mind became moist upon seeing Chandrabha. ||166||
He began to think that the kingdom, along with Chandrabha, who is endowed with beauty and good fortune, is the cause of my happiness, and a kingdom without her is like poison. ||167||
Just as a blemish on the full moon is also beautiful, so too, the blemish on me, the king of kings, embraced by Chandrabha, is also beautiful. ||168||
Meaning: Although I will be criticized for my association with another woman - I will be called a blemish - yet, like a blemish on the moon, that blemish will be the cause of my beauty. ||168||

Just as the fragrance of a lotus cannot overcome the stench of mud, so too, the fame of Chandrabha, blooming in the company of the moon, cannot be overshadowed by the slanderous mud of gossip. ||169||

Though wise and proud, King Madhu, blinded by passion, decided to abduct Chandrabha. He firmly resolved to take her. ||170||

Having subdued the rebellious Bhimaka, the successful Madhu returned to Ayodhya. His heart captivated by Chandrabha, he swiftly summoned all his vassals, along with their wives, to his city. ||171||

He honored them all, adorned in various garments and ornaments, and then, with faces beaming with grace, dismissed them to their homes. ||172||

He then paid great respect to Veerasen, the king of Vatapura, and his wife Chandrabha, and, with feigned joy, sent them back to their own abode. ||173||

"The appropriate ornaments for Chandrabha are not yet ready," he said, "I will send them when they are finished." The naive Veerasen departed, leaving Chandrabha behind. Madhu then seized her and made her his own. ||174||

He bestowed upon her the title of Mahadevi, making her the queen of all women, and indulged in her company as he pleased. ||175||

Meanwhile, Chandrabha's former husband, consumed by the fire of separation, was driven to utter madness, wandering restlessly across the earth. ||177||

One day, he was wandering through the city streets, lamenting, "Chandrabha, Chandrabha," his clothes dusty and his heart heavy, when Chandrabha, standing on the palace balcony, saw him. ||178||

Compassion filled her heart. She turned to King Madhu, who was sitting nearby, and said, "My lord, look at my former husband, wandering about in such a state of despair." ||179||

At that moment, some cruel officials apprehended a man who had been caught with another man's wife and brought him before King Madhu, the dispenser of justice. "Your Majesty," they said, "what punishment should be meted out to this man?" ||180||

"This criminal," replied Madhu, "is a great sinner. Therefore, his hands and feet..." ||181||

Harivaṃśapurāṇa
Cutting off the head, hands and feet is a fearful bodily punishment. The goddess said at that time, "O god! Is this fault not yours?" ||18|| Hearing her words, he became pale like a lotus in winter. He thought, "This is true, she has spoken for my benefit." ||18|| Stealing another's wife is truly the cause of suffering in the future. Knowing him to be a renunciate, she, also a renunciate, said, "O beloved, what is the use of these sensual pleasures? O lord, these pleasures, though they bring happiness now, are like the fruit of a ripened fig, causing pain in the end. These pleasures are not the cause of suffering for oneself or others. They are not considered good by the virtuous, nor are they related to other objects." ||184-186|| Thus being instructed, Madhu slowly gave up the strong intoxication of the intoxicating vine of delusion. ||187|| And he spoke to her, the goddess, with a happy mind and great respect, "Well done! Well done! O virtuous one! You have spoken well here." ||188|| It is not right for virtuous men to do such deeds, which cause pain to others in this world and the next, and which increase sin. ||189|| If even I, who am enlightened, do such a deed that is condemned by the world, what can be said of an ordinary man who is not enlightened? ||190|| Where even in the case of one's own wife, this excessive attachment is the cause of karmic bondage, what to speak of attachment to another woman? ||191|| Even when restrained by the knowledge-yoke, this mind, like a mad elephant, carries the being away on a chariot. What can a wise man do here? ||192|| Those warriors who restrain this unrestrained mind-elephant with sharp whips and bring it on the right path are rare in the world. ||193|| This mind-elephant, intoxicated by the elephant of lust, cannot be freed from its intoxication until it is yoked with the whip of victory over the senses. ||194|| As long as this mind-elephant is not subdued by effort, it is a cause of fear for the rider, not peace. ||195||
1. He became pale like a lotus in winter, hearing her words. ||183||
2. He cannot be freed from his intoxication. ||194||

## Chapter Thirty-Four

The mind, like a well-controlled elephant, guided by the virtuous mahout, conquers the army of sins in the battlefield of austerity. || 996 ||

Those who desire the fruits of sound, form, taste, touch, and smell, and who are driven by the wind of the mind, are like a herd of deer. I, with the strong net of mindfulness, forcefully restrain their accumulated patience and destroy the sins accumulated over time through austerity. || 197-198 ||

Having spoken thus and restraining the impulses of the mind, King Madhu, for the sake of peace from suffering, immersed his intellect in the ocean of knowledge and engaged in austerity. || 199 ||

At that time, a sage named Trimalvahana, accompanied by a thousand other sages, arrived in Ayodhya and resided in the Sahasramra forest. || 200 ||

Hearing of the arrival of the sages, King Madhu, along with his younger brother, Kaithabha, and his wives, went to pay their respects. He performed the rituals of worship and listened to the teachings of Dharma with great attention. || 201 ||

Renouncing worldly pleasures, the cycle of birth and death, physical comforts, and the city, Madhu, along with his brother and many other Kshatriyas, took the vows of Jainism. || 202 ||

Born into a pure lineage, hundreds and thousands of queens, including Chandrabha, who were adorned with vows and good conduct, also renounced the world and became Aryikas. || 203 ||

Madhu's son, Kulavardhana, who was constantly growing in strength, prowess, and victory, protected his lineage. || 204 ||

King Madhu and Kaithabha engaged in severe austerities. They were adorned with the observance of vows, the assembly of the community, and were free from attachments, being liberated sages. || 205 ||

At that time, their only possession was their own body and its parts. They were free from attachment to external and internal objects, and even their body and its parts were not considered possessions. || 206 ||

They practiced fasting for six months at a time, including the months of Vela and Tela, and diligently followed all the principles laid down in the scriptures, thereby destroying their karmas. || 207 ||

Whenever they sat in the sun on the peaks of high mountains, drops of sweat would fall from their bodies, as if the karmas themselves were melting and falling away. || 208 ||

During the rainy season, they would reside at the roots of trees, protecting living beings. Their bodies, like thorns of patience, were not pierced by the arrows of the wind. || 209 ||

In the Harivamsha Purana,
In the nights of the Hemant season, those wise men, who were like gold, endured the frost-like cold, remaining in the state of Pratimā Yoga, their bodies, like lotuses, burning with the radiance of their inner light. ||210||
Those two heroes, wise men, and Muni-Rajas, purified themselves through the practice of right perception, the ten virtues, good conduct, and victory over the enemies of the soul. ||211||
They remained steadfast in self-study, meditation, and yoga, engaged in the practice of Vyayavṛtti, and through the purity of the three jewels, they were seen to have attained the state of being an example for others. ||212||
Thus, for many thousands of years, those two Muni-Rajas, Madhu and Kaiṭabha, who had accumulated a vast treasure of tapas, and who were always free from the defects of the body, ascended to the Sammed Shikhar, and there, after a month of Prāyopagama, they renounced their bodies in a state of deep meditation. ||213-214||
After renouncing their bodies, they became Indra and Sāmanika, the lords of thousands of gods and goddesses, in the heavens of Āraṇa and Acyuta. ||215||
There, they enjoyed the supreme bliss of heaven, possessing a lifespan equal to twenty-two oceans, and being endowed with the right vision. ||216||
The soul of Madhu, having fallen from heaven, was born as the son of Krishna, named Pradyumna, in the womb of Rukmini, the queen of Krishna, in the land of Bharat. ||217||
And the soul of Kaiṭabha, also having fallen from heaven, was born as the younger brother of Pradyumna, named Shamba, in the womb of Jambavati, the queen of Krishna, possessing the same radiance as Krishna. ||218||
Both Pradyumna and Shamba were extremely heroic, wise, and beautiful, possessing the last body, and due to the great joy of their previous birth, they were always eager to help each other. ||219||
The king of Vata-pura, Vira-sena Chandra-bha, consumed by the pain of separation from his beloved, remained absorbed in deep meditation, wandering for a long time in the forest of the world. ||220||
Finally, he attained the human state, becoming an ignorant ascetic, and at the end of his life, he died and became a god named Dhūmakeṭu, as brilliant as a comet. ||221||

As soon as he remembered the enmity from his previous birth, he separated the child Pradyumna from his mother. The Acharya says, "Shame on this enmity that increases sin!" ||222|| Pradyumna was protected from death by his own accumulated merit from his previous births. It is only the power of merit that protects from death. ||223|| Hearing this account of Pradyumna, narrated by the Jina Simandhar, the Chakravarti King Padmaratha bowed down in great joy. ||224|| Narada, also overcome with joy, bowed down to the Jina and flew up into the sky, reaching the mountain called Meghakuta. ||225|| There, he congratulated King Kalasambara on the occasion of his son's birth and praised the queen Kanakmala, who had now become a mother. ||226|| Seeing Rukmini's son, attended by hundreds of young men, Narada was filled with hidden joy and experienced supreme ecstasy. ||227|| After bowing down to Kalasambara and others, Narada received their blessings and, flying up into the sky, reached Dwaraka. ||228|| He narrated the story of Pradyumna to the Yadavas, telling them everything as it happened, as he had seen it, and as he had heard it. ||229|| Then, with his lotus-like face blooming, he saw Queen Rukmini and told her everything that Simandhar Jina had said. ||230|| He said, "O Rukmini! I saw your son playing in the house of the king of the Vidyadharas, Kalasambara. He is as handsome as a Devakumar." ||231|| "Having attained sixteen merits and having collected the knowledge of the Prajnapti, your son will surely come in his sixteenth year." ||232|| "O Rukmini! When the time of his arrival comes, the peacock in your garden will cry out loudly, announcing the good news, out of season." ||233|| "The jeweled fountain in your garden, which is now dry, will be filled with lotus-filled water at the time of his arrival." ||234|| "The Ashoka tree, which announces the removal of sorrow, will sprout leaves and shoots out of season, to remove your sorrow." ||235||

Harivamsha Purana
The dumb ones will remain dumb as long as Pradyumna is far away. They will be freed from their dumbness when he comes near. ||236||
You should know the time of your son's arrival from these manifest signs. Do not interpret the words of Simandhar Bhagwan otherwise. ||237||
Hearing these beneficial words of Narada, milk flowed from Rukmini's breasts. She bowed down with faith and said, "O Bhagwan! You, whose mind is always eager to show affection, have done this great work for me today, which is very difficult for others. ||238-239||
O Muni! O Dheer! O Nath! I was burning in the fire of grief for my son, without any support, and you have saved me by giving me the support of your hand. ||240||
What Simandhar Bhagwan has said is true, and I am convinced that I will surely see my son while I am alive. ||241||
I will live according to the words of the Jina, with a hardened heart. Now go as you please, and keep in mind that I may see you again. ||242||
Thus, Rukmini bowed to Narada and said this. Narada, giving his blessings, departed. After that, Rukmini, leaving behind her grief, remained as before, fulfilling the desire of Shri Krishna. ||243||
This chapter describes the previous lives of Kumar Pradyumna and Shambha, in which their lives as humans, gods, gods as humans, humans as gods, gods as humans, and again humans as gods and gods as humans are described. It also tells us that both of them will ultimately attain the liberation of moksha. Therefore, the devotees of the Jina dharma should read and listen to this story carefully, and act accordingly. ||244||
Thus ends the forty-third chapter of the Harivamsha Purana, composed by Jinaseena Acharya, which is a collection of the Arishta-nemi Purana, and describes Shambha and Pradyumna. ||43||
1. Vipraputra, Soudharma Devi, Shreshthino Manibhadra Purnabhadra Putra, again Soudharma Devi, Madhukaitabee, Achyute Devo, then Pradyumna Shambha Kumaro-(G. Ti.).

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The Forty-fourth Chapter
The glorious son of Bhama, radiant like the orb of the sun, grew in majesty like the young sun. Nourished by that growing Bhanu, the mountain-like Mana (pride) of Satyabhama also increased. ¹

At another time, Narada said to Krishna, O Lord! From where have you come now, and what brings you such great joy? ³

He replied, In the southern range is the city of Jambupura, where lives the Vidyadhara named Jambuvant. His beloved is Shivacandra, and their son is the famous Vishvaksena. Their daughter is named Jambavati, who has come like the goddess Shri herself. ⁴-⁵

The maidens are leading Jambavati, who is resplendent like the graceful crescent moon, to bathe in the Ganga. She is stationed at the Ganga's bank, her full breasts concealed by her garments. She is like the river that flows from the Jambuvant mountain, unapproachable by others. ⁶-⁷

Hearing Narada's words, Krishna was kindled with affection and rose up, like fire blazing up with ghee. ⁸ Without delay, he went to that place, accompanied by the undefeated (Balarama). There he saw the maiden Jambavati, who had just begun her bathing sport. ⁹

Suddenly, the lotus-eyed Krishna caught sight of Jambavati. Then Cupid struck them both with his five arrows. ¹⁰ Krishna embraced the bashful-eyed Jambavati, whose beauty put Shri, Rati, and Hri to shame. ¹¹

Page #572:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana,
There was a loud sound of weeping of the maidens, which spread throughout the nearby camp, due to the abduction of the maiden. ||12||
Hearing the sound, the father of the maiden, the king of the Vidyadharas, Jambavan, became enraged and with a sword in his hand and a shining shield, he flew through the air and quickly reached the spot. ||13||
Seeing him, the celestial being Anavrushti, who was flying in the sky, for a while, treated him as a guest in battle. Then he bound Jambavan, the king of the Vidyadharas, who was holding a sword in his hand. ||14||
The valiant Anavrushti, who was a master of policy, brought him to Krishna and showed him. This incident caused Jambavan to become detached, so he left for the forest to perform penance, leaving his son Vishvaksen under the care of Krishna. ||15||
Krishna, who was filled with supreme joy due to the marriage of Jambavati, took Vishvaksen with him and went to his city of Dwaraka. ||16||
Jambavati's arrival brought joy to Rukmini, so Krishna gave Jambavati a beautiful palace near Rukmini's palace. ||17||
Honoring Jambavati's brother Vishvaksen, he dismissed him from his position and began to enjoy life with Jambavati, indulging in rare pleasures of the earth. ||18||
The love that had initially arisen between Rukmini and Jambavati grew stronger due to their frequent visits to each other's palaces and became unbreakable. ||19||
At that time, there was a king named Shlakshna Roma, who was wise and had fine hair, in the island of Sinhala. Krishna sent his messenger to subdue him. ||20||
The messenger went there and quickly returned, informing Krishna that he was hostile and that he had a daughter named Lakshmana, who possessed excellent qualities. ||21||
Then, Krishna, filled with joy, went there with Balarama. There, they saw Lakshmana, who had long eyes, coming to the sea to bathe. ||22||
Then, Krishna, captivating her heart with his form and killing the powerful general named Drumasen in battle, abducted the beautiful Lakshmana. ||23||
Bringing her to Dwaraka, he married her according to the rituals and gave her a palace near Jambavati's palace. ||24||

Page #573:
---------------------------
## Chapter Forty-Four

Mahaseana, the brother of Lakshmana, approached Hari and bowed down. Honored by the honored one, he was released and went to the island of Sinhala. ||25||

There was a king named Rashtravardhana, the ruler of Surashtr. His city was Ajakhuri, and his queen was Vinaya, the best among women. ||26||

From queen Vinaya, a son named Namuchi was born, a repository of policy and valor. Similarly, there was a daughter named Susima, who seemed like the earth with excellent Soma. ||27||

Prince Namuchi was renowned for his valor throughout the earth. He was like a towering mountain of pride and constantly scorned honorable kings. ||28||

One day, Prince Namuchi and his sister Susima came to the seashore to bathe. The benevolent Narada informed Shri Krishna about them. ||29||

Upon receiving the news, Hari, along with Baldeva, went there and killed Namuchi on the banks of Prabhas Tirtha, where his army was stationed. He then abducted Susima and brought her to Dwaraka. ||30||

There, near Lakshmana's abode, he gave her a golden, excellent palace and enjoyed with her as he pleased. ||31||

After that, King Rashtravardhana, the father of Susima, also sent her the finest clothes and ornaments, and for Shri Krishna, he sent chariots, elephants, and other gifts. ||32||

At that time, in the city of Vitabhaya in the Sindhu region, there lived a king named Meru, a descendant of the Ikshvaku dynasty, who was increasing his lineage. He had a wife named Chandravati. ||33||

From her, a daughter named Gauri was born, who had a fair complexion. She was beautiful like the goddess Gauri, or like the earth devoid of thorns. ||34||

The wise ones had predicted that this girl would be the wife of the ninth Narayana, Shri Krishna. Remembering their words, King Meru first sent a messenger to Shri Krishna and then sent Gauri, who had eyes like a deer. ||35||

Shri Krishna married Gauri, who captivated his heart, and gave her a magnificent palace near Susima's abode. ||36||

At that time, Baldeva's maternal uncle, King Hiranyanaabha, ruled the city of Arishtpura. His wife, Shrikant, was a beautiful woman. ||37||

Page #574:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, a daughter named Padmavati was born to Shrikant, who was like Lakshmi herself. Hearing about her Swayamvara, Balarama and Krishna arrived there, accompanied by heavy rain.  King Hiranyabahu, who was fond of his family, welcomed them with great respect and love.  Hiranyabahu's elder brother Revata, who had already been initiated into the order and was living in the forest with his father, had four daughters: 1. Revati, 2. Bandhumati, 3. Sita, and 4. Rajivanethra. These were already given to Balarama.  When Padmavati's Swayamvara was about to take place, the skilled warrior Krishna forcefully took her away and quickly destroyed those who showed bravery in the battle.  After that, both brothers, along with their wives and brothers, quickly arrived in Dwaraka and started playing like gods.  The delighted Krishna gave Padmavati a palace near Gauri's palace and was very happy.  At that time, there was a king named Indragiri in the city of Pushkalavati in the Gandhara country. His wife was named Merusati. They had a son named Himagiri, who was as stable as the Himalayas, and a beautiful daughter named Gandhari, who was very skilled in Gandharva and other arts.  When Narada, who had arrived quickly, informed Krishna that Gandhari's brother was giving her to the king of Hayapuri, Sumukh, Krishna quickly went there, killed Himagiri in the battlefield, and took Gandhari away. He married her and was very happy with the gentle-faced woman.  He gave Gandhari a beautiful palace near Padmavati's palace and honored her with the best of pleasures.  Thus, Krishna, who was always served by eight beloved queens in his inner palace, who were like the eight directions, who enjoyed the abundant fruits of the tree of virtue, who brought joy to the people, and who possessed great strength, attained prosperity.

Then, the five Pandavas, the renowned sons of King Pandu, arrived at the city of Dwaravati.  They were: Yudhishthira, the eldest; Arjuna; Bhima, the mighty; Nakula; and Sahadeva.  ||1-2||

In the meantime, King Shrenik, with folded hands, asked the Ganadhara Gautam, "O Bhagavan! From which lineage did Pandu and the Pandavas originate?" ||3||

Gautam Swami replied, "O King of Magadha, Pandu and the Pandavas belong to the Kuru lineage, where three Tirthankaras, Shanti, Kunth, and Ar, were born." ||4||

"O King of Magadha, listen to the names of some Kuru kings, starting from the beginning, who served the four goals of life." ||5||

"In the Kuru Jangala region, in the land of the Kurus, there were two kings, Shreyan and Soma Prabha, who adorned Hastinapur. They were the jewels of the Kuru lineage, contemporaries of Bhagavan Rishabhadeva, and leaders of the Dana Tirtha." ||6-7||

"Soma Prabha had a son named Jayanayak. He was later called Megha Swar by Bharat Chakravarti." ||8||

"From Jayanayak came Kuru, from Kuru came Kuru Chandra, from Kuru Chandra came Shubhankara, and from Shubhankara came Dhritikara." ||9||

"After that, countless crores of kings and countless Tirthankaras, as vast as oceans, passed by. Then came Dhriti Deva, Dhritikara, Ganga Deva, Dhriti Mitra, Dhriti Kshema, Suvrat, Vrat, Mandar, Shri Chandra, and Su Prati Shtha, and hundreds of other kings. After them came Dhrit Padma, Dhritendra, Dhritvirya, Prati Shthita, and many more. Then came Dhriti Drishti, Dhriti Dyuti, Dhriti Kara, Priti Kara, and others." ||10-13||

"After them came Bhramara Ghosha, Hari Ghosha, Hari Dhwaja, Surya Ghosha, Su Tejas, Prithu, and Ibha Vahana, and many other kings. Then came Vijay, Maharaja, and Jayaraj." ||14-15||

## Chapter Fifty-Three

**539** Then Sanatkumara became the fourth Chakravarti, initiated by the gods, drawn by the bonds of form. ||16||

Sukumara was his son, then Varakumar, Vishva, Vaishvanara, Vishvaketu, and Brihadhvaja. ||17||

Vishvasena was born then, whose beloved wife was Aira. His son was the fifth Chakravarti, Shanti, the sixteenth Tirthankara. ||18||

Narayana, Narahari, Prasanti, Shantivardhana, Shantichandra, Shashanka, and Kuru were born in this lineage. ||19||

Thus, after the passing of these kings, Surya was born in this lineage, whose wife was Shrimati. They had Kunthunatha, who was both a Tirthankara and a Chakravarti. ||20||

After the passing of many kings in succession, Sudarsana was born, whose beloved wife was Mitra. Their son was Ar, the seventh Chakravarti and the eighteenth Tirthankara. ||21-22||

Then came Sucharu, Charu, Charurupa, and Charupadma. After the passing of other kings, Padmmala, Subhauma, and Padmaratha were born in this lineage. Then came Mahapadma, the Chakravarti. His sons were Vishnu and Padma. ||23-24||

Then came Supadima, Padma Deva, Kulakirti, Kirti, Sukirti, Kirti, Vasukirti, Vasuki, Vasava, Vasu, Suvasu, Shrivasu, Vasundhara, Vasuratha, Indravirya, Chitra, Vichitra, Virya, Vichitra, Vichitravirya, Chitraraha, Maharatha, Dhritaratha, Vrishananta, Vrishdhvaja, Shrivrata, Vratadharma, Dhrita, Dharana, Mahasara, Pratihara, Shara, Parashara, Sharadvipa, Dvipa, Dvipayana, Sushanti, Shantibhadra, Shantishena, and Shantanu, the husband of Yojanagandha, the princess. Shantanu had Dhritarashtra as his son. ||25-31||

Then came Dhritadharma, Dhritodaya, Dhritateja, Dhritayasha, Dhritamana, and Dhrita. Dhrita had a son named Dhritarastra. He had three wives: Ambika, Ambalika, and Amba, who were born in noble families. ||32-33||

From Ambika was born Dhritarashtra,

Page #578:
---------------------------

In the Harivamsha Purana, it is said that Bhishma was born in the lineage of Shantanu. His father was Rukmana, and his mother was Ganga, a princess of pure intellect. ||35|| Dhritarashtra had one hundred sons, led by Duryodhana, who were skilled in statecraft and diplomacy, and always looked out for each other's interests. ||36|| Karna was born to Kunti, the wife of Pandu, through a divine blessing. Yudhishthira, Arjuna, and Bhima were born to her after her marriage. ||37|| Nakula and Sahadeva, the twin sons of Madri, were the jewels of the family, steadfast like mountains. These five sons of Pandu were known as the Pandavas. ||38|| After Pandu and Madri attained liberation through the grace of the Jina Dharma, the Pandavas and the Kauravas, led by Dhritarashtra, became rivals for the kingdom. ||39|| To prevent further conflict, Bhishma, Vidura, Drona, the minister Shakuni, and Duryodhana's friends like Shasharoma, acted as mediators and divided the Kaurava kingdom into two equal parts. One part was given to Yudhishthira and the other four Pandavas, while the other part went to Duryodhana and the hundred Kauravas. ||40-41||
Duryodhana formed a strong friendship with Karna and maintained a close relationship with Jarasandha. ||42|| Dronacharya, a master of archery, acted as a teacher to both the Pandavas and the Kauravas, impartially imparting his knowledge of archery to both sides. ||43|| Gautama Swami says, "O Shrenika! The lineage of Dronacharya's disciples and teachers is well-known. Therefore, I will not speak of it, but instead, I will tell you about the lineage of the Bhargava lineage. Listen carefully." ||44|| The first disciple of the Bhargava lineage was Atreya. His disciple was Kothumiputra. Kothumiputra's son was Amaravarta, Amaravarta's son was Sita, Sita's son was Vamadeva, Vamadeva's son was Kapishtala, Kapishtala's son was Jagatstama, Jagatstama's son was Saravara, Saravara's son was Sharasana, Sharasana's son was Ravana, Ravana's son was Vidravana, and Vidravana's son was Dronacharya, who was revered by all the Bhargava lineage. ||45-47|| Dronacharya

## Chapter 45: The Jealousy of the Kauravas

**49.**  Driven by envy of Arjuna's prowess and wisdom, Duryodhana and the other Kauravas sought to find fault with the treaty. 

**50.** They argued, "The five Pandavas enjoy half the Kaurava kingdom, while we, the hundred brothers, enjoy the other half. What greater injustice could there be?"

**51.** The Pandavas heard this. Yudhishthira, being a man of peace, paid no heed. But the other four, though calm and composed, were stirred like the four oceans by a fierce wind.

**52.** Arjuna, like a cloud, rose and said, "I will drench this enemy mountain with a torrent of arrows." But Yudhishthira, like the wind, calmed him.

**53.** Bhima, like a serpent, rose and said, "I will consume the hundred claimants with my fiery breath." But Yudhishthira, with a mantra, calmed him.

**54.** Nakula, like a mongoose, prepared to destroy the enemy's wicked clan. But Yudhishthira, like a cage, restrained him.

**55.** Sahadeva, like a fire, blazed and said, "I will burn this enemy forest to ashes." But Yudhishthira, like a cloud, calmed him.

**56.** The Pandavas, with peaceful minds, lived on. After some days, while they slept soundly, the Kauravas set fire to their home.

**57.** Awakened suddenly, the five Pandavas, along with their mother, escaped through a tunnel and fled safely.

**58.** This incident ignited the people's hatred for Duryodhana. Indeed, who would not despise a man who delights in evil?

**Note:** The text uses several Jain terms to describe the Pandavas' actions and personalities. These terms are preserved in the translation.

---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana,
After considering them as perished in the fire, the Pandavas' kinsmen performed the post-death rituals and remained at peace. || 59 ||
The Pandavas, endowed with great intellect, crossed the Ganga river and, changing their attire, proceeded towards the east. || 60 ||
Following Kunti's pace, they desired comfort and reached the city of Kaushika, where the king Varna resided. || 61 ||
Varna's wife was named Prabhavati, and she had a daughter named Kusumakomala. The people were greatly attached to the Pandavas, and Kusumakomala had heard their names and seen them. || 62 ||
The fortunate Kusumakomala, resembling a blooming lotus, experienced ultimate fulfillment upon seeing Yudhishthira, who was like the moon. || 63 ||
She contemplated, "May this very man be my husband in this life." || 64 ||
Knowing her intentions, Yudhishthira, bound by love, showed his hope for marriage by taking her hand in a gesture. || 65 ||
Kusumakomala, anticipating his return, spent her time in amusements befitting a young woman. || 66 ||
Then, the five brothers, naturally beautiful, donned the attire of Brahmanas and proceeded, captivating the hearts of the people. || 67 ||
They were highly virtuous, and even during their exile, they enjoyed comfortable seating, sleeping, and food, all effortlessly provided. || 68 ||
Later, they reached the forest of Shleshmantaka, disguised as ascetics. There, they rested in the beautiful hermitage of the ascetics, who welcomed them warmly. || 69 ||
In that hermitage resided Vasantasundari, the daughter of Vindhyasena, the king of Vasundharapura, born to Narmada. || 70 ||
This maiden had been promised to Yudhishthira by the sages, but upon hearing the news of his supposed demise, she condemned her past actions and, desiring to see her beloved in a future life, began practicing austerities in that hermitage. || 71-72 ||

Page #581:
---------------------------
Chapter Forty of the Book

She was the embodiment of beauty and grace, adorned with a fine, white saree. Her hair was tied up in a knot, and her body was radiant with a soft glow, making her resemble a branch of a banyan tree, casting a cool shade.  ||73|| 

With her eyes that extended to her ears, her beautiful lips, and her moon-like face, she captivated everyone with the weight of her hips and breasts. ||74||

She was revered by all the ascetics, as pure and slender as the crescent moon, and she sanctified the entire hermitage with her presence. ||75||

She, the speaker of sweet words, served the Pandavas with the conduct befitting an ascetic, and she relieved their hunger, thirst, and weariness from their journey. ||76||

One day, Kunti, with great affection, asked her, "Oh, daughter, with your body as soft as a lotus, how did you become so detached at such a young age, and why have you taken on this difficult vow?" ||77||

Asked thus with such affection, the deer-eyed princess, with her sweet voice, replied, "Oh, revered one, you have asked well. Listen to the reason for my detachment, for a noble person relieves the sorrow of the heart that is revealed to them." ||78-79||

"My teachers had already promised me to Yudhishthira, the eldest of the Pandavas, who is known for his noble conduct." ||80||

"But due to the influence of my sins, I have heard from people about what happened to him and his mother and brothers, a story that I cannot even bear to remember." ||81||

"'My husband died in the fire, so it was right for me to die in the same way, but I was powerless and could not do so, so I took up asceticism.'" ||82||

Hearing these words, Kunti, the wise and compassionate mother-in-law, said, "Oh, virtuous one, you have done well to protect your life." ||83||

"Friends think differently about their friends, and fate often acts in a way that is contrary to our wishes, so we must strive for long-sightedness." ||84||

"Oh, blessed one, life is for the sake of well-being, so listen to my words. Even if you are an ascetic, you should live, for you will attain liberation." ||85||

Page #582:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana,
Yudhishthira, the eldest son of Pandu, spoke first.
He taught Dharma, adorned with the virtues of Anuvrata, Sheelavrata, and Gunavrata. || 86 ||
Their conversation, filled with mutual joy,
Made the maiden wonder, "Is this indeed Yudhishthira,
Marked with the signs of kings,
Who, filled with compassion, instructs me in the presence of my mother?
Has he appeared here through my merit or my worthy penance?
He is true to his word, dear, and a tireless worker,
May he live long without harm." || 87-89 ||
When the Pandavas were about to leave,
The maiden, with sweet words, honored them, saying,
"May you return to see us, noble ones."
She remained in the hermitage, hoping for Yudhishthira's return. || 90 ||
King Samudravijaya, upon hearing that Duryodhana had burned his sister and nephews in the palace,
Was filled with anger and set out to kill the Kauravas. || 91 ||
Then, the mighty Jarasandha, with great respect,
Made peace between the Yadavas and the Kauravas,
And returned to his capital. || 92 ||
The Pandavas, abandoning their ascetic guise,
Took on the form of ordinary Brahmanas,
And, accompanied by Kunti, reached the great city of Ihapur. || 93 ||
There, a terrifying man-eating demon named Bhrigam,
Like a bumblebee, was tormenting the people.
Bhima destroyed him, ending the fear of the inhabitants. || 94 ||
The people, freed from fear, honored the Pandavas and their mother.
Then, following their own desires, they reached the great city of Trishringa. || 95 ||
There ruled a king named Prachandavahana,
A fierce punisher of the wicked.
His beloved wife was Vimala Prabha. || 96 ||
They had ten daughters, all perfect in beauty,
With faces like the full moon,
And masters of all the arts. || 97 ||

Page #583:
---------------------------
Chapter Forty-Five

The names of the ten daughters were: 1. Gunaprabha, 2. Suprabha, 3. Hri, 4. Sri, 5. Rati, 6. Padma, 7. Indivara, 8. Visva, 9. Acharya, and 10. Asoka. Gunaprabha was the eldest. 

These daughters were previously offered to Yudhishthira, but after receiving news of his demise, they became Shravakas, observing the Anuvrata. 

In the same Trishrungapura, there lived a wealthy merchant named Priyamitra, who was a connoisseur of human nature. Recognizing the Pandavas as extraordinary individuals, he treated them with great respect. 

Priyamitra had a wife named Somini, and they had a daughter named Nayanasundari, whose beauty and grace were a delight to the eyes. 

This daughter had also been previously offered to the valiant Yudhishthira, and like the other princesses, she had embraced the Anuvrata. 

King Prachandavahan, along with his wife, and Priyamitra, the merchant, considered the Pandavas, disguised as Brahmanas, to be great men. They wished to offer all their daughters to Yudhishthira, their eldest son. 

However, the daughters had firmly resolved in their hearts, "Even if Yudhishthira has departed to the other world, he is my husband in this life, and no other." With this conviction, they did not accept the Pandavas, disguised as Brahmanas, as their husbands. 

Thereafter, the Pandavas, with their unwavering resolve like Mount Sumeru, left that city and continued their journey, eventually reaching Champapuri, where King Karna ruled. 

There, a maddened elephant was causing havoc in the city. The skillful Bhima, in a playful manner, subdued the elephant and calmed its rage. Witnessing Bhima's valor, Karna was filled with resentment. 

From there, they proceeded to Vaidishapura, a city as beautiful as Indrapura. At that time, King Vrishdhavja ruled the city, and his son, Dridhayudha, was the crown prince. 

King Vrishdhavja's queen was named Dishavali, and she had a daughter named Dishananda. Dishananda's beauty, like the purity of the directions, was renowned throughout the land. 

One day, Bhima, with his deep voice and penetrating gaze, a handsome man with captivating eyes, appeared as a beggar in the royal palace.

Page #584:
---------------------------
546
Harivamsha Purana
Knowing that great city, the king took his daughter and, standing in the inner palace, spoke these sweet words: "This daughter is suitable for you, accept her. Extend your hand, O blessed one, for the hand-grasping." 
Bhima said, "Oh, this is an extraordinary gift, I am not free to accept such a gift at this time." Saying this, he went to his dwelling and informed Yudhisthira and the others. 
After that, they stayed in that city for a month and a half. Then, crossing the Narmada, which is skilled in providing entertainment, they entered the Vindhya mountains. 
In the Vindhya mountains, there was an island in the middle, shaped like twilight. In that city called Sandhyakara, there lived a king named Singhaghosha, born of the Hidimba lineage. 
He had a wife named Sudarshana, and from her was born a daughter named Hridayasundari. The lord of Trikuta, Meghavega, desired Hridayasundari and had requested her from King Singhaghosha, but he could not obtain her. 
The knowers of auspicious omens said about Hridayasundari, "Whoever kills the vidyadhara who is perfecting the gada-vidya on the Vindhya mountains, he will be the husband of Hridayasundari." 
Bhima went to the Vindhya mountains and saw a vidyadhara sitting in the hollow of a tree, perfecting the gada. Seeing this, Bhima took the gada in his hand and with a single blow, he felled the tree. 
Then, Bhima had a union with Hridayasundari. This connection of the Pandavas with the Hidimba king Singhaghosha was a cause of great joy. 
After that, the Pandavas, who were blessed with great fortune, wandered through various countries in the south and prepared to go to Hastinapura. 
On their way, they reached the city of Makanda, which reflected the heavens. At that time, the Pandavas, adorned with beautiful bodies, were like the gods, embodying the divine illusion. 
The king of that city was Drupada, his wife's name was Bhogavati, and they had many sons, including Dhristadyumna.

## Chapter Thirty-Five

A body adorned with beauty, grace, and auspiciousness, Draupadi, the daughter of King Drupada, was unmatched in her beauty.  [122]  All the princes were driven mad by her, and they came to her father, bearing gifts, seeking her hand in marriage. [123]  Fearing the consequences of refusing them, King Drupada, with a heavy heart, invited all the princes to participate in the Swayamvara, a contest to win Draupadi's hand. [124]  The earth was filled with princes, captivated by Draupadi's beauty, including Karna, Duryodhana, and others, who gathered in the city of Makanda. [125]  Surenravardhana, a celestial king, arrived with his daughter, seeking a suitable husband.  At the behest of King Drupada, he declared that the Gandiva bow would be the instrument for testing the suitors. [126]  The proclamation declared that whoever could string the formidable Gandiva bow and hit the celestial target (Chandrakavedha) would be Draupadi's husband. [127]  Hearing this, Drona, Karna, and other kings gathered around the bow, forming a circle. [128]  However, the bow, imbued with divine power, was impossible to even look at, let alone touch or string. [129]

After all the princes failed, Arjuna, the destined husband of Draupadi, and always righteous in his nature, approached the bow.  He looked at it, touched it, and effortlessly strung it, as if it were a woman under his control. [130]  As Arjuna strung the bow and released it, the sound reverberated with such force that the eyes of Karna and the other princes were blinded, and their ears deafened. [131]  Seeing Arjuna's prowess, Karna and the others wondered if he was reborn, having died with his brothers, as he possessed such natural strength and power. [132]  How could a common archer, other than Arjuna, achieve such a feat?  His vision, his grip, his skill - all were truly remarkable. [133]

1.  The princes were driven mad by desire. [121]
2.  On earth, Dhananjaya (Arjuna) is known as "Kshaoni" (earth), "Jya" (bowstring), "Kashyapi" (descendant of Kashyapa), and "Kshiti" (earth). [125]
3.  Always, always, Arjuna is righteous and simple. [130]
4.  Earth. [133]

In the Harivamsha Purana, 
Mounted on the Bhrammachakra, Arjuna, holding a bow in his right hand, aimed at the target called Chandrakavetha, in the presence of the kings. ||134||
Draupadi, quickly approaching Arjuna, with a desire for a boon, placed a garland on his neck with her lotus-like hands. ||135||
The garland, scattered by a sudden gust of wind, fell on the bodies of the five Pandavas. ||136||
Then, a foolish, fickle person, loudly proclaimed that she had given a boon to the five princes. ||137||
Like a blooming vine adorning a fragrant, tall, fruit-bearing tree, Draupadi stood near Arjuna. ||138||
Then, Arjuna, with his anklets firmly bound, took Draupadi to his mother Kunti, in front of the kings, who were ignorant of dharma. ||139||
Some of the kings, eager for battle, followed Arjuna, though they were forbidden by the wise king Drupada. ||140||
Arjuna, Bhima, and Dhristadyumna, the three archers, stopped them from afar, preventing them from taking even a single step forward or backward. ||141||
Dhristadyumna, seated on his chariot, shot an arrow marked with his name, signifying all relationships, into the lap of Drona. ||142||
Drona, Ashwatthama, Bhishma, and Vidura, upon reading the arrow signifying all relationships, were filled with immense joy. ||143||
The arrival of the Pandavas brought great joy to King Drupada, his relatives, and Drona, and the sound of conch shells and drums filled the air. ||144||
Upon this union of brothers, which brought supreme joy, Duryodhana and others feigned affection and greeted the five Pandavas. ||145||
Just as a lamp, filled with oil of affection, shines brightly when held in someone's hand, so too, Draupadi, filled with the weight of love, shone brightly with the union of marriage. ||146||

Chapter Thirty-Five: The Marriage Ceremony

Seeing the marriage ceremony of Draupadi and Arjuna, the kings departed to their respective places. Duryodhana also went to Hastinapur along with the Pandavas. [17]

The Kauravas and Pandavas, having divided the kingdom in half, stayed in Hastinapur as before. [18]

Yudhishthira and Bhima, who had promised to marry the daughters of the Jinas during their exile, brought them to Hastinapur and married them, making them happy. [149]

Draupadi was Arjuna's wife, and she had the mind of a daughter-in-law towards Yudhishthira and Bhima, while Sahadeva and Nakula considered her as their mother. [150]

Yudhishthira and Bhima also had the mind of a father-in-law towards Draupadi, and Sahadeva and Nakula had the appropriate mind, filled with love for Arjuna, towards their two elder brothers. [151]

Gautama Swami says, "Who can prevent the sin arising from the slander of those who are devoted to the slander of those who are of pure conduct?" [152]

Speaking of the faults of others, even if they exist, is a cause of sin. What to speak of speaking of faults that do not exist? It is a cause of sin whose fruit is never wasted, it must be experienced. [153]

Even among ordinary people, there is equality of wealth due to affection, but it is only in the matter of wealth, not in women. What to speak of those who are famous in all three worlds? [154]

Why are the tongues of the wicked who slander the Pandavas, who are in the category of great men, not cut into a hundred pieces? [155]

One should understand that the speaker and listener of sin, who do not receive its fruit in this world, are as if it is preserved for them in the next world. Meaning: The fruit of sin that the speaker and listener do not receive in this birth, is surely received in the next birth, and with interest. [156]

Just as listening to virtuous stories with a good mind is considered a cause of good fortune for the speaker and listener, so listening to sinful stories is considered a cause of misfortune for them. [157]

Therefore, abandon the arrogant speech that is full of false accusations, and...

Harivamsha Purana
Drutavilambita Vrittam
Serve the purity of truthful speech, which is flawless, which is bright with its own glory, which is full of virtues, which is victorious, and which is declared by the omniscient. ||158||
In this world, in times of adversity and defeat, good conduct is a refuge for beings, because the fruit of good conduct, which is policy and valor, overcomes the anger of the enemy. ||159||
The Dharma, which is like a row of flames, is like the rainy season to destroy the summer of the increasing heat, is a single Jina Agama to refute others, and is a treasure trove of various benefits, such a Vrata Vidhana is certainly worthy of being adopted by those who use the stick of the Shruta as collyrium. ||160||
Thus ends the forty-fifth chapter of the Harivamsha Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which is part of the collection of the Arishtanemi Purana, which describes the origin of the Kuru dynasty, the meeting of the Pandavas and the Kauravas, and the marriage of Arjuna to Draupadi. ||45||

## Chapter Forty-Six

1.  The Pandavas, who were like mountains in their fortitude and respect for their kin, were enjoying their time in the city of Hastinapur.
2.  The five Pandavas were growing in power and prosperity every day, and seeing this, the Kauravas were once again agitated and disturbed.
3.  Following Shakuni's advice, Duryodhana quickly defeated Yudhishthira in a game of dice. Having won, Duryodhana, along with his younger brothers, addressed Yudhishthira, saying, "O Yudhishthira, you are a man of truth, your promises are never false. Therefore, you must abide by your promise and leave this place. You must remain hidden where your name cannot be heard."
4.  Though Bhima and the other brothers were angered by Duryodhana's words, Yudhishthira calmed them down and left Hastinapur, abandoning all his possessions, for a period of twelve years.
5.  Draupadi, filled with love and joy, followed Arjuna, just as the moonbeams follow the moon.
6.  Then, these valiant men, filled with courage and always ready to help each other, reached the beautiful forest of Kalajala.
7.  At that time, a celestial being named Sutara, son of Prakirnaka Suri, was playing in the forest, having come from the city of Asurodgita.
8.  He was skilled in the art of Shavari and was adorned in the attire of a Kirata. He was enjoying himself with his wife, Kusumavali.
9.  His wife was also dressed as a Kirata, and they were playing together as they pleased. Arjuna, the archer, saw this celestial being, also an archer.
10.  As soon as they saw each other unexpectedly, a fierce battle erupted between them, a battle where the directions were covered with divine arrows.
11.  Then, a hand-to-hand combat ensued, and Arjuna, with his strong fist, struck the powerful celestial being on his chest.

Page #590:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, Arjuna, with a strong fist, struck the chest of the powerful Vidyadhara, causing his wife, Kusumavali, to beg for her husband's release. Arjuna, having freed her, bowed to her and proceeded towards the southern range of the Vijayadha mountain. ||13||

Following this, the valiant heroes, in due course, reached the city of Meghadala, ruled by King Singha. King Singha's wife was named Kanakamekhala, and they had a beautiful daughter named Kanakavarta. In the same city, there was another beautiful daughter named Charulakshmi, born to the merchant Megha and his wife Alka. ||14-15||

Following the instructions of the wise, Bhima, the bearer of mighty shoulders, went to seek alms and obtained both these daughters. What is difficult for the virtuous? ||16||

These noble men, blessed with a gentle nature, rested there for a few days. Then, they continued their journey and reached the country of Kaushala. ||17||

After staying there for a few months in comfort, they reached the Ramgiri mountain, previously served by Rama and Lakshmana. ||18||

On this mountain, built by Ramachandra, stood hundreds of Jina temples, shining like the moon and the sun. ||19||

Every day, people from various lands came to worship the Jina images. The Pandavas also paid their respects to these images with great devotion. ||20||

Just as Ramachandra had played with Sita, Arjuna, along with Draupadi, engaged in various games in the beautiful gardens of that mountain. ||21||

These fortunate Pandavas, who had never known the separation of happiness, roamed freely and engaged in virtuous deeds, spent eleven years on that mountain. ||22||

From there, they went to Viratnagar, where King Virat resided. King Virat's wife was named Sudarshana. ||23||

The Pandavas, along with the wise Draupadi, concealed their identities and lived in Viratnagar, honored by King Virat. ||24||

Thus, the Pandavas, free from distractions, spent their time happily in Viratnagar, enjoying themselves. ||25||

Now, the next event related to them is described.

---------------------------
Shatcatvarimshah Sargah
26. There was a city named Chulika, and its king was Chulika. His wife was Vikachā, who was as beautiful as a blooming lotus and was purified by the virtues of a hundred sons.
27. Kīchaka was the eldest among them, and he was the foremost among the cruel-minded. He was intoxicated with his beauty, youth, knowledge, valor, and wealth.
28. Once, he came to Virāṭanagara to see his sister Sudarśanā. There, he saw the chaste Draupadī.
29. Draupadī was made fragrant by a special perfume, and her body was filled with the qualities of beauty, grace, and auspiciousness.
30. Merely by seeing her, the arrogant Kīchaka's heart was filled with humility, and wherever he went, his mind was absorbed in her.
31. He tried to seduce her through various means, both directly and indirectly, but she did not find a place in his heart.
32. Despised and rejected by her, he became like a piece of straw. The Shailandhrī (Draupadī in disguise) then reported his misconduct to Bhīmasena.
33. Enraged, Bhīmasena, wearing the disguise of Shailandhrī, made a secret arrangement to meet the love-stricken Kīchaka in a secluded place in the evening.
34. Like an intoxicated elephant attracted to the scent of a female, the blind with passion Kīchaka came to the appointed place. Bhīmasena then embraced him with his arms, threw him to the ground, and crushed him with his powerful fists, just as one would crush a mountain.
35-36. Thus, fulfilling Draupadī's desire, the magnanimous Bhīmasena, filled with compassion, said, "Go, you sinner," and released him.
37. Thereafter, Kīchaka, endowed with great detachment, took refuge in the lord of ascetics, Ratīvardhana, abandoning the objects of senses.

Page #592:

Contemplating the self through introspection, and purifying the self, the Muni named Kicaka, desiring to purify the three jewels, heard the scriptures. ||38||
One hundred brothers of Kicaka, their minds deluded, not seeing him, were enraged. They saw a burning pyre and, thinking it was Kicaka's, were filled with anger. ||39||
Those wicked ones, desiring to burn the pyre, were strong and powerful. They were thrown into the pyre by Bhima and turned to ashes. ||40||
Called by one, they were taken by Bhima, intoxicated with pride. Many are killed by a single lion, with its teeth. ||41||
Then, Kicaka, the virtuous one, was in the middle of a secluded garden, sitting on a couch, engaged in yoga, when he was seen by a Yaksha. ||42||
To test his mind, the Yaksha, in the guise of Draupadi, approached him in the middle of the night, showing his lustful form. ||43||
The virtuous one, like a deaf man, was absorbed in listening to the sweet words, and like a blind man, he saw the beautiful form, full of charm. ||44||
For one who has guarded his senses well and attained purity of mind, the knowledge of the true nature of things arises. ||45||
Having completed his yoga, the Yaksha bowed to him and said, "O Lord, forgive me," again and again. ||46||
Bowing again, he asked the reason for his infatuation with Draupadi, for such infatuation cannot arise without a cause. ||47||
The Muni Kicaka, bowing to the Yaksha, spoke of their past lives, his own and Draupadi's. ||48||
On the bank of the river Tarangini, where it meets the river Vegavati, I was a Mlechcha, a wicked man, small and insignificant, living in a small village. ||49||

Chapter 46: From the perspective of the virtuous, the peaceful one, "I attained the state of being a human being. My father was Dhandeva and my mother was Sukumarika. ||50|| My name was Kumardeva, and my mother was Suvrata. She killed a virtuous muni by giving him poisoned food. ||51|| Entering hell, she experienced the suffering born from killing a virtuous person. She wandered in the animal and hell realms. ||52|| I, being without vows, wandered in the world of intense suffering. Driven by the wind of sin, I became a dog in the life of my mother. ||53|| Later, in a hermitage, a tapasvi named Sita gave birth to a son named Madhu to a tapasvi named Mrgasringini. I grew up in the hermitage of the tapasvis. ||54|| Seeing the greatness of giving, I took initiation after a shravaka gave food to a muni named Vinayadatta. As a result, I ascended to heaven and then fell from there, becoming Kicaka. ||55|| Wandering in the world for a long time, my mother Sukumarika experienced great suffering. Finally, she became a human being, unfortunate and experiencing suffering. ||56|| Her name was Anumatika. She became Draupadi, endowed with tapasya and its causes. Because of this, I was filled with attachment. ||57||

See, a mother becomes a sister, a daughter becomes a beloved wife, and a wife becomes a mother, sister, and daughter. It is amazing how in the world, which is like a revolving wheel, there are intermingling and conflicting rules. ||58|| Therefore, O noble ones, understand this strange nature of the world well and become detached from worldly pleasures, however great they may be. Become virtuous, free from the causes of the world, and strive for liberation with great tapasya. ||59||

Thus, hearing the words of the muni Kicaka, the yaksha, along with his wives, bowed down to the guru, whose mind was adorned with right faith, and disappeared at the end. ||60||

Thus ends the forty-sixth chapter of the Harivamsha Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which is a collection of the Arishta-nemi Purana, and describes the nirvana of Kicaka. ||46||
At that time, the soul was adorned with the ornaments of right faith, which are like precious jewels. Afterwards, he bowed to the Muni Raja with great joy and disappeared into the forest. ||60||

## Chapter Forty-Seven

**The Story of Kichak**

After the events of the cow-grazing incident and the subsequent burning of the forest by the fire of Bhima and Arjuna's anger, the Pandavas, who were unwavering in their adherence to their own principles, remained united in their father Pandu's house, like a flock of birds.  

Having completed their period of anonymity, the Pandavas, led by Dharma Raja, joined Duryodhana in the war, just as the wise are accepted by all. 

Just as the monsoon clouds, having filled all directions and showered the earth with life-giving water, attain the highest position, so too did the Pandavas, who fulfilled everyone's desires and showered the world with the nectar of righteousness, attain the highest position.  

Despite this, the hundred Kaurava brothers, led by Duryodhana, continued to harbor resentment in their hearts, seeking ways to defeat the Pandavas.  Just as the purity of flowing water cannot last forever, so too would their peace be short-lived. 

Duryodhana and his brothers, like before, began to sow seeds of discord in the treaty.  This angered Bhima, Arjuna, and the other Pandava brothers, but Yudhishthira calmed them down. 

Yudhishthira, with his pure mind, unwavering courage, and compassionate heart, never wished harm upon the Kauravas.  Therefore, he, along with his mother and brothers, set out towards the south. 

On their journey, they reached the Vindhya forest.  There, they saw Vidura, engaged in penance in his hermitage.  They bowed to him and praised him, saying:

"O venerable one, your birth is blessed, for you have renounced all worldly possessions and are engaged in the path of liberation, as taught by the Jina, with unwavering faith and courage."

This path is marked by pure vision, characterized by faith in the truth, by knowledge that illuminates all things, and by impeccable conduct.

Page #596:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, it is stated that those who follow the path of vows, secrecy, assembly, and the control of senses and passions, will attain the state of liberation quickly. Having praised this path and the great sage Vidura, Yudhishthira, along with his brothers, entered Dwaraka. When the Yadavas learned of the Pandavas' arrival, they welcomed them with great joy and Yudhishthira entered Dwaraka with his brothers. The meeting of the Yadava brothers with their sisters and nephews after a long time brought them immense joy. All the Yadava princes, including Lord Neminatha, Krishna, Balarama, and the entire inner palace and the people were very happy at that time. The sight of the Pandavas and their relatives, which was pleasing to the eyes, brought happiness to everyone. The Yadavas and Pandavas met with joy, believing that their enemies had actually done them a favor. The meaning is that if Duryodhana and others had not done them wrong, they would not have been able to meet and experience this joy. Therefore, everyone believed that their enemies' actions were not actually wrong, but rather a favor. After that, Krishna showed them five magnificent palaces, each equipped with all the comforts and luxuries, where the five Pandavas resided separately. Yudhishthira received Lakshmimati, Bhima received Seshavati, Arjuna received Subhadra, Sahadeva received Vijaya, and Nakula received Rati. The Pandavas, who were like gods, married these Yadava daughters in the order mentioned above and enjoyed themselves with their beloved wives. Gautama Swami says, "O Shrenika! I have told you the story of the Kuru warrior in brief. Now I will tell you about the exploits of Pradyumna, listen carefully." Pradyumna, adorned with the qualities of art and beauty, grew like the moon, increasing the ocean of joy of his relatives. Pradyumna, the son of a Vidhyadhara, learned the celestial arts, including the art of flying, from the Vidhyadharas at a young age. From childhood, he captivated the hearts of enemies, friends, men, and women with his beauty, form, fortune, and valor, which were like weapons. Upon reaching adulthood, Pradyumna became proficient in all weapons. With his beauty, he captivated the hearts of young men and women, even though he was a warrior.

## Chapter Thirty-Seven

**Mन्मथ, मदन, काम, कामदेव, मनोभव** - by these names, he was known. Though he was not **अनंग** (without a body), he was called **अनंग** (without a body). **Meaning:**  Pradyumna was the embodiment of Kamadeva. In literature, one of the names of Kama is Ananga, hence Pradyumna was also called Ananga. || 25 ||

Having defeated Simharatha in battle, who had conquered five hundred sons, Pradyumna showed his prowess to Kalasambara. **Meaning:** At that time, a Vidhyadhara named Simharatha was fighting against Kalasambara. To defeat him, he sent his five hundred sons, but Simharatha defeated them all. Pradyumna was such a skilled warrior that he defeated him in battle and presented him to Kalasambara. || 26 ||

Seeing such a valiant son, Kalasambara was very pleased and considered both the ranks of victors to be under his control. || 27 ||

Impressed by this, the king, according to the rules, bestowed upon Pradyumna the great crown of the Yuvaraja, which was like a flower for the fruit of the great kingdom. || 28 ||

The five hundred sons of King Kalasambara then began to think of ways to destroy Pradyumna from all sides. || 29 ||

They were constantly looking for ways to deceive him. But they were unable to deceive him while he was sitting, sleeping, wearing clothes, chewing betel nut, eating, or drinking. || 30 ||

One day, a group of princes, who were accustomed to acting according to dharma, took the virtuous Pradyumna Kumar near the gate of the Siddhayatana and encouraged him, saying, "Whoever climbs to the top of this gate will receive a treasure of knowledge and a crown from the god who resides there." Inspired by his companions, the prince quickly climbed to the top of the gate and received a treasure of knowledge and a crown from the god who resided there. || 31-32 ||

Then, encouraged by his brothers, he quickly entered the cave called Mahakal and obtained a sword, shield, umbrella, and fly whisk from there. || 33 ||

From there, he went to the Naga cave and obtained a superior footstool, a Naga bed, a seat, a Veena, and the knowledge of building palaces from the god who resided there. || 34 ||

From there, he went to a well and obtained a tall flag marked with the sign of a Makara from the god he had defeated in battle. Then, he entered the fire pit and obtained two garments purified by fire. || 35 ||

After that, he entered the mountain shaped like a ram and obtained two earrings for his ears. Then, he entered the forest called Panduka and obtained a crown and a garland of nectar from the god named Markata who resided there. || 36 ||

Page #598:

In the Kapiththa forest, the god of the forest presented Vidyaakar, the elephant, to the god. In the Valmiki forest, the god of the forest presented a knife, armor, and a signet ring, etc. ||37|| On the Sharava mountain, the god of the mountain presented a waist belt, armor, a bracelet, an armband, and a necklace. ||38|| In the Shukara forest, Shukradeva presented a conch and a divine bow. There, he also received a garland and Indrajal from the fallen Manovega, the Vidyaadhara. ||39|| The enemy of Manovega was the Vidyaadhara Vasant. The Kumar made them friends, and from him, he received a daughter and Narendrajal. ||40|| Further on, he entered a building and received a floral bow and arrows that caused madness, delusion, sorrow, intoxication, and grief from the lord of the building. ||41|| Then, he went to another Naga cave and received sandalwood and agarwood garlands, a floral umbrella, and a bed of fruits from the lord of the cave. ||42|| Then, he went to the Durjaya forest, which was on the Jayanta mountain, and from there, he brought back the daughter of the Vidyaadhara Vayu and his wife Saraswati, named Rati. ||43|| Thus, seeing the Kumar Pradyumna, who had received many great benefits in these sixteen places of gain, the Kumaras like Sanvara were amazed. Then, understanding the greatness of punya, they calmed down and returned to their city with Pradyumna. ||44-45|| He was riding in a divine chariot drawn by white bulls, adorned with a bow, five arrows, an umbrella, a flag, and divine ornaments. He was conquering the minds of men and women with the arrows of Kama. Thus, Pradyumna, surrounded by hundreds of Kumaras, entered the city of Meghakoot. ||46-47|| He bowed and saw Kalasanvara. Then, he set off in the chariot towards the house of Kanakmala. ||48|| Seeing Pradyumna, who was adorned in such a way and was pleasing to the eyes, Kanakmala was filled with a different emotion. ||49|| Pradyumna descended from the chariot and bowed. Kanakmala praised him greatly, smelled his head, seated him beside her, and touched him with her soft hand. ||50||

161. Due to the intense rise of delusion, her soul became helpless and, digging into the soil of her heart, many wrong thoughts arose in her mind. ||51||

She thought, "The woman who receives the touch of his body with her own body even once in her sleep, is the only woman in the world; the rest are just the form of a woman." ||52||

"If I get the embrace of Pradyumna, then my beauty, grace, good fortune, and charm are successful; but if it is difficult to obtain, then all this is as insignificant as grass to me." ||53||

With such thoughts in her mind, Pradyumna, who had not even imagined such thoughts in his mind, bowed to her and, receiving her blessings, went home. ||54||

The Vidyadevi, Kanakmala, who was longing to obtain the pleasure of Pradyumna's embrace, was overwhelmed with intense sorrow and forgot all her work. ||55||

The next day, hearing of her illness, Pradyumna went to see her. What did he see? Kanakmala was lying on a bed of lotus leaves, very distressed. ||56||

Pradyumna asked her the reason for her illness, and she expressed her feelings through bodily gestures and words. ||57||

Knowing this contrary situation and condemning her actions, Pradyumna was eager to explain the relationship between mother and son to her. ||58||

In response, Kanakmala told him the whole story from beginning to end, saying, "How did you find me in the forest? How did you raise me? And how did I receive the benefit of knowledge?" ||59||

Hearing about his connection with Kanakmala, Pradyumna's mind became doubtful. To get a clear answer, he went to the Jain temple where the Muni Raja, Sagar Chandra, resided. He bowed to him with joy and asked him about all his past lives. Knowing his past lives, he also learned that this Kanakmala was Chandrabha in his previous life. ||60-61||

Pradyumna, the holder of pure right vision, also learned from the Muni Raja that he was going to receive the knowledge of Prajnapti from Kanakmala. Then, Pradyumna, who possessed the virtue of patience, went to Kanakmala, who was suffering from love, and asked her about the knowledge of Prajnapti. ||62||

1. Pradyumna's embrace.
2. The benefit of desires.

Seeing him, Kanakmala was delighted and said, "Listen, Kama, I will tell you something. If you want, I will teach you the Gauri and Prajnapti vidyas." ||63|| Then, Pradyumna, desiring her favor, said, "This is your grace, I want them, please give me the vidyas." Kanakmala, following the proper procedure, gave him the two vidyas, which were difficult to obtain even for the Vidyadharas. ||64|| Pradyumna, with outstretched hands, received the vidyas and was very happy. After receiving them, he spoke these excellent words: "Earlier, you saved my life by bringing me to the forest, and now you have given me the vidyas. By giving me life and knowledge, you are my guru." Saying these excellent words, he circumambulated her thrice, bowed his head, and stood before her. Then, he requested her to give him whatever instructions were appropriate for a son. After that, he went away. ||65-66|| Knowing that she had been deceived by him, Kanakmala, in a fit of anger, struck her chest, breasts, and sides with her nails. ||67|| She then showed her body to her husband and said, "My lord, look at what Pradyumna has done!" Her husband, believing her deception, was also angry. ||68|| King Kalasambara, enraged by this incident, called his five hundred sons in private and said, "Kill Pradyumna in such a way that no one else knows about it." ||69|| Having received their father's order, the wicked princes, filled with joy, took Pradyumna with them the next day and went to the lake called Kalambhu. ||70|| They all jumped on Pradyumna at once, desiring to kill him, and repeatedly urged him to play in the water of the lake. ||71|| At that moment, the Prajnapti vidya told Pradyumna everything that was happening. Hearing this, Pradyumna became very angry and instantly hid his real body through magic and jumped into the lake with a false body. As soon as he jumped, all the princes, like merciless thunderbolts, jumped on him, desiring to kill him. ||72-73|| Pradyumna, with his feet upwards and his clothes downwards, killed all the princes except one, leaving him alive. He made his brother the bearer of five braids and sent him to Kalasambara to deliver the news. ||74||

75. Hearing of Putraodanta's fate, Kalasambara, ignited with doubled rage, prepared for war, gathering all his forces.

76.  For a long time, Pradyumna, with his army empowered by Vidya, fought against Kalasambara.  Defeated and despairing, Kalasambara approached Kanakmala, saying, "Give me the Prajnapti Vidya."

77. Kanakmala replied, "I gave it to him in his childhood, along with his milk."

78. Knowing the woman's deceitful nature, Kalasambara returned to the battlefield, fought, and was captured by Pradyumna, imprisoned beneath a rock.

79. At that moment, the highly learned Narada arrived. Pradyumna honored him, and Narada explained all the connections.

80. Releasing Kalasambara from his bonds, Pradyumna, seeking forgiveness, said, "Whatever your mother did was due to her past karma. Please forgive her."

81. Pradyumna, the master of strategy, who had no recourse, released the five hundred princes, driven by brotherly love, and repeatedly sought forgiveness.

82.  Satisfied, Kalasambara, the king, granted Pradyumna leave, his mind eager to see Rukmini and Krishna.

83.  Prostrating before his father with affection, Pradyumna, accompanied by Narada, ascended a chariot and set off for Dwaraka.

84.  As they flew through the sky, engaged in various tales, they passed Hastinapur and saw an army in the distance.

85.  Pradyumna asked Narada, "O revered one, whose vast army is this, stationed in the middle of the forest?  It is heading west, moving with great speed.  Where is it going, and for what purpose?"

86.  Narada replied, "Listen, Pradyumna, I will tell you a part of the story.  There is a king named Duryodhana, an ornament of the Kuru dynasty.  He is a great warrior, a terror to his enemies, and he resides in Hastinapur."

Harivamsha Purana
Previously, when I was the elder brother, you were born to Rukmini and I was born to Satyabhama.  Krishna had promised that he would give his daughter to the elder son. ||88||  You were born first, and then Bhanu was born to Satyabhama.  However, the servants of Rukmini informed Krishna about your birth first, so you were declared the elder brother.  The relatives of Satyabhama informed Krishna about Bhanu's birth later, so he was declared the younger brother. ||89||  Later, while you were traveling somewhere, you were abducted by the demon Dhumketu.  Rukmini was very distressed, while Satyabhama was pleased. ||90||  When there was no news of you, Duryodhana, who was adorned with the wealth of fame, sent his daughter, Udadhikumari, to Bhanu. ||91||  O Lord! This daughter, who is adorned with various qualities, is going to Dwarika, protected by a large army, and is destined to be the wife of Bhanu, the son of Satyabhama. ||92||  Hearing this, Pradyumna kept Narada in the sky and immediately descended, assuming the guise of a Shabara, and stood in front of the army. ||93||  He said, "Krishna has promised to give me a reward, so give it to me and let me go."  When the Shabara said this, some people asked, "What do you want?" ||94||  The Shabara replied, "I want the most valuable thing in this entire army."  When he said this, the people angrily said, "The most valuable thing in the army is the daughter."  The Shabara then said, "If that is the case, then give me the daughter."  Hearing this, the people said, "You were not born to Vishnu-Krishna.  The daughter will be given to the one who was born to Vishnu."  The Shabara insisted, "I was born to Vishnu."  Seeing the audacity of this man who was speaking nonsense, they tried to push him aside with the tips of their bows and were about to move forward. ||95-96||  Then, with the help of his army of illusionary Shabaras, he defeated Duryodhana's army, took the daughter, and ascended to the sky. ||97-98||  Seeing his divine form in the chariot, the daughter became fearless.  She was happy to know the truth from Narada and breathed a sigh of relief. ||99||  1. हतस्त्वं म. । 2. भाविनीव म., ख. । भाविनी + इन इतिच्छेदः ।

**The Divine Chariot**

Having boarded the divine chariot, which grants all desires, along with Narada, Pradyumna reached Dwaraka, the city adorned with garlands.  || 100 || From afar, he saw the city, guarded by a vast ocean, protected by ramparts, and teeming with towers and balconies. || 101 ||  Seeing Bhanukumar, the son of Satyabhama, exiting the city for horse training, Pradyumna, disguised as an old man, descended from his celestial chariot.  || 102 ||  He brought a magnificent horse for Bhanukumar, who immediately mounted it. || 103 ||  The shape-shifting horse tormented Bhanukumar for a long time, then brought him back to the old man, fulfilling his own desires. || 104 ||  Bhanukumar dismounted, and the old man, with a mocking laugh and a flick of his hand, said, "Oh, what a skilled horseman you are!" || 105 ||  The old man then claimed to be too old to ride, and challenged anyone to help him mount the horse, promising to demonstrate his skills.  || 106 ||  Pradyumna, using his divine powers, made himself so heavy that the people were unable to lift him.  He then, in his old man disguise, mounted the horse and rode away, showcasing his skills. || 106 ||

**Pranks of the Divine**

Next, Pradyumna, using his divine powers, unleashed a horde of mischievous monkeys and horses, who ravaged Satyabhama's garden and dried up her large reservoir. || 107 ||  As Krishna, the king, approached the city gates, Pradyumna unleashed a swarm of flies and mosquitoes, making it difficult for him to proceed.  He then rode a donkey and a ram chariot, playing pranks in the city for a long time. || 108 ||  After entertaining the citizens with various tricks, Pradyumna joyfully played a game of chess with his grandfather, Vasudeva. || 109 ||

**The Brahmin's Disguise**

Pradyumna then arrived at Satyabhama's palace, where a feast for Brahmins was being held.  He assumed the form of a Brahmin and sat on the most prominent seat.  The other Brahmins, angered by the presence of an unknown Brahmin, were harassed by Pradyumna, who used his divine powers to move their seats and disrupt their meal. || 110 ||

In the Harivamsha Purana:

11. Having disguised himself in the attire of a barber, the one who eats the Matrimodaka (a kind of sweet), said, "That barber, who was my messenger, has been disrespected."

112. Sankarsana desired to pull his feet, but Pradyumna, the creator of wonder in the world, continued to enjoy his own will for a long time.

113. The signs of the arrival of Pradyumna, mentioned earlier, then went to the supervisor of the breasts of the mother.

114. She, being extremely astonished, thought, "Is my son, who has returned after sixteen years, indeed the same?"

115. At that moment, Pradyumna, the prince, also regained his natural state, and addressing the mother with affection, he bowed to her.

116. Joyful and with eyes filled with tears, she embraced the son of Rukmin and quickly abandoned her sorrow with tears.

117. From the pores of her body, the love for the son seemed to emanate like the nectar of the sight.

118. When the auspicious conversation between the mother and son took place, the mother said to that son, who gave joy to the mind.

119. "O son! That Kanakamaala is blessed, by whom the fruit of a son, the sight of your childhood play, has been experienced."

120. After being thus addressed, the one who gives joy to the eyes said, "Mother, behold, I am displaying my childhood behavior here."

Thereafter, in that very moment, he became a child of that day, with his fingers tasted, and lotus-eyed, blossoming.

After that, Pradyumna had eaten all the food that was prepared for the Vipra-bhojana (Brahmin feast). When nothing was left, he told the miserly Satyabhama to vomit the eaten food, and then he left from there.

The Forty-Seventh Chapter
Then the child, having grasped the nipple, began to suck. Thus lying on his back, he found delight in the tender shoots of his mother's hands. [122]
Crawling with his body, he was born, and then tried to get up, but fell down again. Clinging to his mother's fingers, he began to move on the jeweled floor. [123]
After playing in the dust, he clung to his mother's neck and found joy. With a smiling face and glancing eyes, he began to babble. [124]
His mind, filled with the charming play of the child, being established in his natural state, bowed down and informed her, "O mother, I am going to take you to the sky." [125]
Quickly lifting her up with his arms, he stood revealed in the sky. He said, "Let all the Yadava kings hear: This Lakshmī-like Rukminī, dear to Lord Hari, is being taken away by me. Yadavas, protect her if you can." [126-127]
After saying this and blowing the conch, he placed her in the aerial car with Narada and the ocean-maiden, and himself stood ready for battle in the sky. [128]
Then the Yadava kings, equipped with four-limbed armies and skilled in the use of five weapons, came out of the city to fight. [129]
By the power of his knowledge, Pradyumna deluded the entire Yadava army and fought with Hari for a long time in the sky. [130]
When Kaushalya was performed by the son of Krishna, the two mighty warriors, with mature vision, rose up to fight. [131]
Quickly coming to the sky, Narada, the messenger of the father and son, restrained them, explaining their relationship. [132]
Then Hari, filled with joy, embraced the bowed Pradyumna and, with tears of happiness in his eyes, blessed him. [133]
Raising the army put to sleep by Māyā with his knowledge, the pleased Madana entered the city with his kinsmen. [134]
They celebrated a festival of joy at the reunion of the son. [135]

**Harivamsha Purana**

**136**
Then, the highly respected Pradyumna Kumar, having aroused the shame of other women, obtained the auspicious marriage with the most excellent and highly respected maidens. 

**137**
(Gautama Swami says) Just as the queen Kanakmala, adorned with a radiant golden garland, had witnessed the auspiciousness of her marriage with her husband, the Vidyadhara Kalasamvara, and had attained great happiness through the influence of the excellent teachings of the Jina, so too, Pradyumna Kumar, having married the maidens Uddhikumari and others according to the proper rites, began to enjoy them.

Thus ends the forty-seventh chapter of the Harivamsha Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which is a collection of the Arishta-nemi Purana, and which describes the union of the Kuru dynasty and Pradyumna with his parents.

Harivamsha Purana
Then, after that, Pradyumna, like another Lakshmi, married the girl and in Dwaraka, he began to enjoy her with delightful pleasures. ||13|| Shambhu was very clever in gambling. One day, in front of everyone, he won all of Subhanu's wealth in gambling and distributed it to everyone. ||14|| Shambhu won Subhanu's son in a game with many birds who spoke in different languages. In a gathering of Krishna's followers, there was a debate about the use of fragrances, in which Shambhu again defeated Subhanu's son. ||15|| Once, he won Subhanu's son in a gathering of Krishna by obtaining two divine garments purified in fire and divine ornaments. ||16|| Once, he defeated Subhanu's son by showing his strength, and Krishna was very happy. Krishna asked him for a boon, and he received a month's reign, during which he performed many wicked deeds. ||17|| Krishna, who was filled with love and anger, punished the wicked Shambhu. One day, Shambhu, taking the form of a girl, got into the chariot and entered Satyabhama's lap. ||18|| Satyabhama thought that this girl was brought for her son Subhanu, so she married her to Subhanu. But after the marriage, Shambhu revealed his true form in front of everyone. ||19|| In one night, he performed the auspicious bath ceremony for marriage with a hundred girls and made his mother Jambavati very happy. ||20|| At that time, hundreds of sons of Satyabhama and other queens, who were as famous as Indra, also married many girls and enjoyed themselves as they pleased. ||21|| One day, Shambhu went to the house of his respected grandfather Vasudeva and, after paying his respects, said playfully, "O venerable one! You traveled the earth for a long time, enduring hardships, and only then did you obtain the worshipful and beautiful daughters of the Vidyadharas. But I, sitting at home, without any hardship, married a hundred girls in one night. Look at the difference between us." ||22-24|| Hearing this, Vasudeva said, "My son! You are like an arrow, driven by another (Pradyumna), and where is your movement? Only in the house. That is why there is a great difference between us." ||25||

## Chapter Thirty-Eight

I am the crocodile of the ocean of Vidya-dhara cities, and you are the frog of the well of Dwaraka, yet you consider yourself my equal!  ||26||

What I have experienced, seen, and heard in the cities of the Vidya-dharas is extremely captivating and extremely rare for others. ||27||

Upon hearing this, Shamba, bowing down, said to Vasudeva with respect, "O Arya, I wish to hear your story. Please tell me." ||28||

Vasudeva replied, "O Vatsa, sound the joyous drum and inform all the Yadavas. I will tell my story along with everyone else's." ||29||

After the joyous drum was sounded, all the Yadavas, including their wives and children, gathered together. Vasudeva then recounted his entire story to them in detail. ||30||

He described the division of the Lokas, the lineage of the Hari-vansha, his own games, and how the people of Surya-loka, instigated by King Samudra-vijaya, tried to thwart my games. Then, I cunningly escaped from Surya-loka and came out. ||31||

He recounted this divine story, a story of both humans and Vidya-dharas, from the birth of Pradyumna and Shamba to their ultimate glory. ||32||

All the Vidya-dhara women in Vasudeva's inner palace were overjoyed to hear this story, remembering the past events. ||33||

The members of the assembly, the elders, women, young people, children, all the Yadavas, the people of their inner palace, the Pandavas, and the people of Dwaraka, were all filled with wonder upon hearing Vasudeva's story. They were free of doubt, and the goddesses like Shiva, having tasted the nectar of this story, praised him. ||34-35||

All the kings, adorned with fragrant garments, went to their respective places, and all their inner palaces were guarded by their protectors and returned to their respective places. ||36||

The story of Vasudeva, filled with many wonders, was revived and became a daily topic of conversation in every household. ||37||

Then, bowing down, the king Shrenika, who was asking questions, addressed the Ganadhara Gautam, following the divine sound of Bhagwan Mahavir Swami, and began to describe some of the Kumaras in this way: ||38||

Four sons were born to Stimit Sagar: Urriman, Vasuman, Vir and Patalsthira. ||45-46|| King Vidyutprabh, Malyavan and Gandhamadana were the three sons of Himavat, all three were truthful and valiant. ||47|| Vijay had six famous sons: Nishkamp, Akampan, Bali, Yugant, Kesharin and the intelligent Alambush. ||48|| Mahendra, Malaya, Sahya, Giri, Shail, Nag and Achal, these seven sons of Achal bore meaningful names. ||49|| Vasuki, Dhananjay, Karkotak, Shatamukha and Vishwarupa were the five sons of Dharan. ||50|| Dushpur, Durmukha, Durdarsha and Durdhar, these four sons of Puran were known for their four actions. ||51|| Chandra, Shashank, Chandraabh, Shashin, Soma and Amritaprabh, these six sons of Abhichandra bore names as pure as the moon. ||52|| Vasudeva had many powerful sons. O Shrenik! I will tell you the names of some of them, listen. ||53|| Vasudeva had two sons named Akrur and Krur from his queen Vijayaseena. He had two sons named Jwalan and Agniveg from his queen Shyama. ||54|| Gandharvasena had three sons: Vayuveg, Amitagati and Mahendragiri. These three sons seemed like the three worlds. ||55||

##  Chapter Forty-Eight:  Description of the Yadava Princes

**574**
In the Harivamsha Purana, there were three and a half crore (35 million) princes, all mighty and handsome, resembling the god of love, who were always engaged in playful activities.  ||7||

The city of Dwaravati was constantly filled with these valiant princes, who rode in chariots and on elephants, adorned in various costumes, and possessed great strength. They brought joy to the citizens and made the city shine like the netherworld, adorned with the celestial beings. ||75||

The wise Gautam Swami says that those who listen with devotion and single-minded attention to the story of these noble Yadava princes, who fell from heaven and attained great merit by following the path of the Jinas, will be free from all diseases and enjoy a long and healthy youth.  ||76||

Thus ends the forty-eighth chapter of the Harivamsha Purana, composed by Acharya Jinasena, which is a collection of the Arishta-nemi Purana and describes the names of the Yadava princes. ||48||

1. The fifty-ninth chapter
The graceful and charming Yashoda, the younger sister of Krishna, who was the most excellent in the world and possessed a spotless fame like the moon, and who was adorned with the ornaments of beautiful qualities, bore the extremely heavy burden of her first youth.

2. Her delicate fingers, whose nails were adorned with the splendor of jewels, had a natural luster that surpassed the beauty of the moon, and her tender lotus-like feet, which were equally elevated, had their modesty vanished from the world.

3. Her sturdy and hidden ankles and knees were extremely captivating, and their successive rotations were in the reverse order. Her unparalleled thighs, capable of bearing a heavy burden, had no comparison.

4. Her soft, pale, and steadily shining thighs, filled with excellent essence, surpassed the beauty of the plantain tree's stem and were extremely renowned for their true qualities.

5. The broad hips of that maiden, who moved like a swan, were like the banks of a river of merit that delighted the women, and they shone with the splendor of the buttocks, which were like an unmanifest land for Cupid.

6. That maiden, with her delicate and extremely dark body hair, was extremely pleasing to the eyes of people, and with her three-fold waist-band, she shone brilliantly among the women.

Page #614:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, she became exceedingly beautiful among all the beautiful women of the world, due to the captivating depth of her navel and the intricate pattern of the three lines (trivalli) in the middle of her body. [6]

On her chest, she bore the weight of firm, round, and large breasts adorned with the most brilliant blue nipples, making her appear as if she were carrying two shining golden pots, sealed with strong, indigo-blue gem seals, for fear that the nectar within might spill. [7]

With shoulders as soft and plump as the flowers of the Sirisha tree, and palms like clusters of the finest lotus petals, her arms were adorned with beautiful, red nails like the flowers of the Kuruvaka, and vines resembling the seed pods of the mango tree, making her exceedingly beautiful. [8]

With a neck as smooth as a conch shell, a chin like a bimbi fruit, lips like a bimbi fruit, a face adorned with a beautiful smile, white cheeks, curved eyebrows, a forehead like the edge of a lotus pond, and ears like the stems of double-petaled, soft, blue lotuses, she was adorned with large, white, and black eyes, making her exceedingly beautiful for a long time. [9]

With a moon-like face and a beautiful smile, she wore her hair, which was adorned with shining curls that repelled the attraction of bees, falling over her broad hips, resembling a dangling love-snare that captivated people. [10]

Her body was adorned with fourteen ornaments, including rings, bracelets, and anklets, making it a treasure trove of beauty. She wore a shining garment, soft clothes, and a magnificent garland, and enjoyed all the pleasures that were appropriate for a young woman. With her body, she overshadowed and rejected all other young women in the world. [11]

She was the land of honor, respected by all the members of the Yadu dynasty, including her father and son, who treated her with due respect. She was the abode of all arts and beautiful qualities, and she was like Saraswati herself in the presence of her family. [12]

Thus, as time passed, the sons of Balarama came to her and greeted her. [13]

## The One Hundred and Forty-Ninth Sermon

**577**

She went to the city and sought refuge at the feet of the chief of the group of Ayikas, Suvrata, the Ganini, and with her, went to the feet of the Muni, Vratadhara.  She bowed down and asked him, "O Bhagavan! What sin did I commit in a previous life that I have been afflicted with this ugliness?"  The Muni, whose eyes were developed with the knowledge of the past, replied, "Daughter, in a previous life, your soul was a man in the land of Surastra, possessing a beautiful form.  There, due to excessive indulgence in worldly pleasures and sensual delights, your mind became dull and cruel.  You were unable to control your mind and eyes, and you acted freely in the world."

**15**

"Once, a Muni was engaged in severe austerities on his deathbed.  You drove your chariot over him, causing his nose to be crushed.  The Muni, however, possessed great fortitude and was not disturbed by this incident."

**16**

"The Muni's life was not taken, so you did not suffer hell.  However, his body was harmed, and therefore, in this life, your face is deformed, lacking a nose.  As it is in the world, one reaps the fruits of one's actions."

**17**

"The Jina has said, 'Whoever in this world, even once, takes the life of a living being, will suffer the pain of being killed by others in a future life.  And whoever, even once, harms the limb of another, will suffer the harm of limbs many times over, as a result of their own actions.'"

**18**

"Cruel men, fearless due to their power, strive to kill human beings and other living beings through their mind, speech, and body.  No matter how clever they may be in future lives, the great lord of evil, the giver of suffering, will repeatedly exert his influence over them, causing them to suffer again and again."

**19**

"Therefore, those who desire their own and others' well-being, even if they are kings, should always stay away from sins like violence."

For those who are engaged in the destruction of others, their own welfare is always to be sought, even by the lords. For the lords of those who are engaged in the cycle of birth and death, their own created arms do not always remain in power. ||20||
Hearing these words of the guru, she bowed down and proceeded with the great work.
Having renounced the world and all her relatives, she took the vow of renunciation, covering her breasts with a white sari and pulling out her black hair. ||21||
She had thrown away her ornaments and garlands, and her arms, like vines, were as soft as flowers. At that time, she was pulling out all her hair with her soft fingers, as if she were pulling out a group of thorns from the inside of a wisdom-filled hut. ||22||
She covered her entire body, from her hips, chest, breasts, abdomen, and feet, with a very soft garment. That chaste woman was then adorned for a long time like the river of the autumn season, which had covered its sandy banks with clear water. ||23||
Seeing that new renunciant, who had been worshipped at the time of her initiation by her family members and who was the mother of great austerities, the hearts of all the great people were filled with this thought: Is this Saraswati, who is patient, or is she Rati, who is practicing austerities? ||24||
She was endowed with pure emotions, having attained them through the austerities of vows, virtues, restraint, and fasting, and through the contemplation of impermanence and other such things that she practiced daily. She was a resident of the teachings of the Agamas, possessed many excellent qualities, and always lived with the group of renunciants. She continued to practice austerities. ||25||
After many years and groups of days had passed, she went to the lands of the birth, initiation, and nirvana of the Jina, and then, at the inspiration of a very large assembly, she went with her fellow renunciants to the vast forest of Vindhyachal. ||26|| And at night,

Chapter Forty-Nine

The image-like Āryikā, with a mind as pure and unwavering as a sharp sword, stood at the crossroads. At that time, a large army of dark-skinned Bhils, like the night itself, arrived swiftly to attack a very wealthy caravan. They saw the Āryikā standing in the image-yoga. ||27||

"This is the forest deity standing here," thinking this, hundreds of Bhils bowed down and requested a boon from her, saying, "O Bhagavati! If we can obtain wealth without any trouble by your grace, we will be your first servants." ||28||

Having made this wish, that large group of Bhils, strong and numerous, attacked the caravan from all sides, killed them, looted them, and then, having accomplished their task, returned to the vicinity. There they saw the Āryikā standing in the image-yoga. ||29||

When the Bhils saw the Āryikā and moved on, a lion came and began to attack them fiercely. Seeing the attack, they calmly took refuge in samadhi and vowed to remain without food until death. After that, she died in the image-yoga and went to heaven. This is right, because a virtuous person never deviates from his or her duty. ||30||

Although the body of that Āryikā, who constantly earned merit and did not abandon the samadhi she had taken, was torn apart by the claws, mouth, and teeth of the lion, her three fingers remained there. These three fingers were seen by the Bhils. ||31||

The Bhils looked all around that land, which was stained with blood and whose path was hidden, but they could not find the Āryikā anywhere. Finally, they decided that the deity who granted boons was content with this blood, so they placed those three fingers there as a deity and, killing large wild buffaloes, those fierce and cruel Bhils...

In the Harivamsha Purana, it is said that the supremely compassionate ones, who have attained the state of Sugata, are free from all impurities. From that time onwards, the foolish people of the world, misled by the path shown by the forest dwellers, have become addicted to flesh and kill animals like buffaloes. (34)

Even in the lower realms of heaven, no deity drinks the blood of buffaloes, wields a trident, or engages in mutual killing. Yet, poets, like skilled painters, create poetry that defames virtuous people, finding a mere pretext. (35)

The opinion of the virtuous is that even the truthful and secret actions of others, when spoken of in public by others, become a cause of bondage. Then, how can it be said by any virtuous person that revealing the non-existent faults of someone in front of the world is not a cause of hell? (36)

These deceitful poets, enemies of their own and others' welfare, declare falsehood as truth and engage in deceitful speech.  Foolish beings, misled by the words of the gods, fall into the path of killing others, like sheep into a wolf's den. (37)

Where is the path of supreme Dharma, which, when practiced properly, brings happiness to all beings and is compassionate towards all creatures, manifested in the world? And where is the conflict of Adharma, born from killing others, leading to hell, imagined by wicked poets as Dharma in this wicked age? (38)

Kings, who have revealed the character of the Lokapalas and who always shower grace upon beings out of fear of wicked people, also kill buffaloes and rams, aiming at the gods. What then can be said of other lowly humans? (39)

A person, who, having achieved success in some way, believes that it was achieved by the grace of the representative deity, and who, using his own weapons, cuts open his own body and offers blood as a sacrifice, how can he be compassionate in cutting open the bodies of others? (40)

The fifty-eighth chapter, abundant in explanations, pleasing to the devotees of the world, possessing the quality of being free from contradictions, is the best of the world. If, indeed, the boon is given by the boon-giving deity, then no one should be deprived of their desired object. ||41|| The representative and the support of the wealthy, the work of others, the daily ritual of lamps, oil, offerings, and flowers, all from others. And yet, the boon of others is given by the deity of the ignorant, this is the greatest joke in the world. ||42|| The image worshipped on earth, of the accomplished Jina, is worshipped by devotees with wealth, devotion, and worship. It bears fruit in the hereafter, due to the special nature of the result, like a wish-fulfilling tree or vine, according to the desires of people. ||43|| Falling into the wrong path, causing others to fall, and allowing others to fall, these three evil tendencies lead to the inflow of evil karma, which is the main cause of misery. Walking on the path spoken by the monks, causing others to walk, and allowing others to walk, these three good tendencies lead to the inflow of good karma, which is the main cause of happiness. ||44|| When one's own mind, speech, and body are good, why does one not perform only virtuous deeds in the world? Why does one perform evil deeds with one's own useless actions? Alas! It seems that there is a great cause for this, due to heavy karma bound in the past. ||45|| Alas! The world is firmly bound by the darkness of ignorance, the ignorance of scriptures, and the ignorance of the guru. The pure eye is the medicine for this. Even though people desire to see, and even though they understand the truth, they are confused at every step. What are they capable of understanding? ||46|| The success of an action is according to one's past karma, but a person who worships the idol as a representative of the deity, considers that success to be due to the idol. Therefore, he becomes happy and starts offering blood sacrifices by cutting his own limbs with weapons. How can one who cuts his own limbs have compassion for cutting the limbs of others? ||40|| The people who have satisfied the excellent deity, who gives boons, with great worship, and whose opposite qualities in the form of hatred have been removed, if the desired boon is given by her in the world, then no human being should be deprived of the desired material. Meaning: When everyone can satisfy the deity through worship and obtain the desired boon from her, then everyone should be filled with desired objects. ||41|| The deity of the ignorant, whose idol and temple are built by other wealthy people, and whose daily rituals of lamps, oil, offerings, flowers, etc., are always fulfilled by others, gives the desired boon to others. This is a great joke in the world. Meaning: What boon can she give to others, who cannot build her own idol and temple, and who has to depend on others for daily necessities like lamps, oil, offerings, and flowers? ||42|| The image of the accomplished Jina, worshipped on earth by devotees with wealth, devotion, and worship, bears fruit in the hereafter, according to the special nature of the result, like a wish-fulfilling tree or vine, according to the desires of people. ||43|| Falling into the wrong path, causing others to fall, and allowing others to fall, these three evil tendencies lead to the inflow of evil karma, which is the main cause of misery. Walking on the path spoken by the monks, causing others to walk, and allowing others to walk, these three good tendencies lead to the inflow of good karma, which is the main cause of happiness. ||44|| When one's own mind, speech, and body are good, why does one not perform only virtuous deeds in the world? Why does one perform evil deeds with one's own useless actions? Alas! It seems that there is a great cause for this, due to heavy karma bound in the past. ||45|| Alas! The world is firmly bound by the darkness of ignorance, the ignorance of scriptures, and the ignorance of the guru. The pure eye is the medicine for this. Even though people desire to see, and even though they understand the truth, they are confused at every step. What are they capable of understanding? ||46||

## Chapter 51: The Description of Durga's Birth

**582**

**Harivamsa Purana**

**47.** The earth is filled with fire, wind, water, land, creepers, and trees, as well as with inanimate deities imagined in temples. The sky is filled with the sun, moon, stars, and planets, which are visible to human eyes. So, who in this world is not deluded?

**48.** This world is somehow real, somehow unreal, somehow one, somehow many, somehow eternal, somehow impermanent, somehow self-existent, somehow other-existent, somehow finite, somehow infinite, and diverse in its qualities, qualities, actions, and causes. Yet, due to their deep delusion, beings of this world are immersed in monism.

**49.** The principal Nayas, such as Nigama, Sangraha, and Vyavahara, which are established by all Nayas and proofs regarding the definite object, are false if they contradict each other, and appropriate if they look at each other.

**50.** The faith of a person who is devoted to the teachings of the Jina, free from the attraction of other deities, and deeply devoted to the principles of life, is the one that, without any effort, leads to liberation, happiness, and the attainment of right knowledge, good conduct, and all auspicious things.

**51.** This accumulation of vows, qualities, and conduct, as well as various intense austerities, becomes pure only when it is accompanied by the purity of vision. Therefore, let those who are eager to acquire the qualities of the Jina worship the pure vision, which destroys birth, old age, and death, and brings happiness.

**Thus ends the fifty-first chapter of the Harivamsa Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which is part of the collection of the Arishta-nemi Purana, and describes the birth of Durga.**

**Notes:**

1. **Purusha-purussara:** This term refers to the principle of the soul, which is the essence of all beings.
2. **Muni-pati-shasana:** This refers to the teachings of the Jina, which are the ultimate guide to liberation.
3. **Siddhi-sukha-anvayi:** This refers to the happiness of liberation, which is attained through the practice of the Jina's teachings.
4. **Bhavaparam-aparamananta-yiaasu cha chenmana:** This refers to the desire for liberation, which is the ultimate goal of all beings.

## Chapter Fifty

A certain merchant, with a heap of precious gems he had purchased, approached King Jarasandha.  [1]  Seeing the gems, King Jarasandha asked him, "Where did you obtain these gems?" The merchant replied, "O King, these gems are from Dwaravati, the abode of the mighty King Krishna." [2]  

The Yadava king, the conqueror of the ocean, and his queen, Shiva Devi, were present when the Tirthankara, Neminatha, was born.  For fifteen months, the gods showered the earth with precious gems. [3]  These gems are from that rain.  Hearing this account of the Yadavas' greatness from the merchant and his ministers, Jarasandha's eyes turned red with anger. [4]  

Hearing of the Yadavas' prosperity, King Shrenik, whose eyes were filled with the knowledge of the scriptures, bowed to the Ganadhara, Gautam, and asked, "O Lord, the Yadavas are renowned throughout the world, their virtues shining like rays of light, like a heap of gems in the ocean.  Jarasandha, whose strength is unmatched, has heard of Krishna, who has achieved perfection in his unwavering valor, having fought countless battles.  What did Jarasandha do when he heard of Krishna?" [5-7]

Then, the Ganadhara, Gautam, eager to serve King Shrenik, narrated the story of Jarasandha and Krishna, the two great men. [8]

Upon hearing news of the Yadavas, Jarasandha turned away from peace and began to consult with his chief ministers. [9]  He asked, "O ministers, tell me, how have these enemies, like fragile waves in the ocean, remained neglected until now?" [9-10]

The king's ministers, with their eyes like spies, are pure of vision.  Why then, standing before him, do they deceive their king and themselves? [11]  If I, blinded by my great wealth, have not seen these enemies, how have you, my ministers, remained oblivious to them?  Why have you not seen them? [12]  If these enemies, born of evil, have not been crushed by great efforts, then they are like venomous snakes, causing pain and suffering. [13]

In the Harivamsha Purana, having slain his son-in-law Kamsa and his brother Aparajita, the wicked Yadavas have taken refuge in the sea. ||14|| Although they are situated in the middle of the ocean, which is inaccessible, they are like fish, drawn out by the water of the means, and are to be slain by me. ||15|| Why are they fearless while residing in Dwaraka? Or they can remain fearless only until my fire of anger is kindled. ||16|| For so long I was unaware of them, so they lived happily with their relatives, but now that I know, how can they live happily? ||17|| Those who have committed grave offenses are not worthy of peace or charity, therefore, keep them in isolation and subject them to punishment. ||18|| Then, the ministers, who considered punishment as the primary means, pacified Jarasandha, who was in the path of grace, and said, "O Lord! We know that the Yadavas are prospering greatly in Dwaraka, but listen to the reason why we have been spending time there." ||19-20|| Born in the lineage of the Yadavas, Sri Neminath Tirthankara, Sri Krishna, and Balarama, these three great souls are so powerful that it is difficult for even the gods to conquer them, let alone humans. ||21|| At the time of his descent from heaven, he was worshipped with a shower of jewels, and at the time of his birth, Indra performed his coronation on Mount Meru, and the gods always protect him. How can Neminath Jina be conquered by you in battle? Or how can all the kings of the earth together conquer him? ||22-23|| Have you not heard of the extraordinary power of Balarama and Krishna in the many battles, including the slaying of Shishupala? ||24|| The mighty Pandavas, who have earned fame through their valor, and many Vidyadharas, who are favorably disposed due to marital ties, are currently on their side. ||25|| And how can the Yadavas be conquered, who have 3.5 crore Kumaras, all skilled in warfare? ||26|| The wise Yadus, knowing the path of policy, think that they are invincible, but they are mistaken. ||27||

## Chapter Fifty

The Yadavas, protected by the gods and empowered by the force of time, are like sleeping tigers, O Lord! Let them remain in Dvaraka.  We too shall remain here, enjoying the passage of time.  For, O Lord, the state in which one's own and others' time is spent happily is considered praiseworthy.  Even if they are angered by your remaining in this state, accept the challenge to fight them.  Thus, the ministers advised him, but Jarasandha did not heed their advice.  For, a stubborn man does not abandon his stubbornness at the time of destruction.  Ignoring his ministers, the king, eager to provoke his enemies, sent a messenger named Ajit Sena to Dvaraka.  This valiant king, Jarasandha, sent messengers to the kings of the east, west, south, north, the mountains, and the middle country, all of whom were masters of four-fold armies and who never disobeyed his orders.  Upon seeing the messenger, Karna, Duryodhana, and other kings, all of whom were truthful and desired the good, arrived at Jarasandha's court.  Followed by these kings and their mighty sons, Jarasandha, though hindered by false pretenses, set out with the desire to conquer.  Just as a virtuous man reaches heaven by performing virtuous deeds, so too did the messenger Ajit Sena, devoted to his master's work, reach the city of Dvaraka, adorned with excellent gates.  Entering the beautiful city, filled with many wonders, he was seen by the citizens and reached the royal palace.  He entered the assembly of Lord Vishnu, filled with all the Yadavas and controlled by Bhoja and the Pandavas.  After paying his respects, he sat on the offered seat and, puffed up with the pride of his master's strength, began to speak.  He said, "Hear me, all you Yadavas, with your minds focused.  The great king Jarasandha, the supreme lord, commands...

In the Harivamsha Purana, 
"You yourselves clearly state what wrong I have done to you, due to which you have entered the belly of the ocean, filled with fear." (42)
"Although you have taken refuge in the fort due to being guilty, you are not afraid of me, you come and bow to me." (43)
"If you stay here in the fort, without bowing, then I will drink the ocean and with my forces, I will make you suffer." (44)
"When your presence was unknown, you had the strength of time and place, but now that you are known, how can you have the strength of time and place?" (45)
"Hearing the words of the messenger, all the kings, including Krishna, became angry and with furrowed brows, they said, "Your king, whose death is near, is coming with all his forces, so we will honor him with war. We are eager for battle." (46-47)
"Saying this, the Yadavas dismissed the messenger. He, struck by their harsh words like a thunderbolt, went to his master and reported everything, thus fulfilling his duty." (48)
"After the messenger left, the ministers, Vimala, Amala, and Shardula, skilled in counsel, consulted with King Samudravijaya and said, "O King! Since peace will be the cause of peace for both our side and the other side, let us use peace with Jarasandha. This group of princes, etc., is all our own people. In a war full of danger, there is doubt about their well-being." (50-51)
"Just as our army has warriors who shower down unerring arrows, so too is Jarasandha's army famous in the world." (52)
"In the midst of war, the death of even one of our own people would be a cause of sorrow, just as it would be for the enemy." (53)
"Therefore, for the good of all, peace is the most commendable course of action. Therefore, let a messenger be sent to Jarasandha from us, without arrogance, for the sake of peace." (54)

Even if Magadha does not become peaceful through diplomacy, we will do what is appropriate. What is the harm in trying diplomacy? || 55 ||
Thus, the ministers consulted with the king and informed him. Then, after consulting amongst themselves, they decided to send Lohjangha. || 56 ||
Lohjangha, a skilled, valiant, and wise prince, set out with his army to make a treaty with Jarasandha. || 57 ||
After reaching the Malava region, he established his army camp in the forest. There, he encountered two Jain monks, Tilakananda and Nandana, who were wandering in the forest, observing a fast for a month, following the rule of accepting food only if found in the forest. || 58 ||
Seeing them, Lohjangha welcomed them and offered them food and drink. As a result, he received five miracles. || 59 ||
From that day onwards, that place became a pilgrimage site called "Devavatar" on earth, and it became a cause for the pacification of the sins of thousands of beings. || 60 ||
The wise Lohjangha, a skilled diplomat, went to Jarasandha and explained the situation to him in private. || 61 ||
Jarasandha was very pleased with Lohjangha's words and agreed to a treaty for six months. || 62 ||
After receiving honors from Jarasandha, Lohjangha returned to Dwaraka and informed everyone about the victory over the sea and other matters, thus fulfilling his mission. || 63 ||
Then, for a year, the Yadavas focused on preparing for war, while maintaining peace. After a year was complete, Jarasandha, the one who fulfilled his great vow, arrived at the Kurukshetra battlefield, accompanied by a multitude of great vassals and an army that filled the directions like a sea. || 64-65 ||
Krishna, the other ocean, had already arrived there with his army, which was like a multitude of rivers. || 66 ||
At that time, many kings from the south, north, and west, who were connected to Vishnu, were ready with their entire armies. || 67 ||

In the Harivamsha Purana,
The Dasārhas, the Bhojas who comforted them, the Pandavas, their kinsmen, and other renowned lion-like kings, all known for their devotion to Hari, came together. || 68 ||
Among them, King Samudravijaya was the lord of an Akshauhini, and King Ugrasena, the foremost of men, was also the lord of an Akshauhini. || 69 ||
The glorious Meru, a descendant of the Ikshvaku dynasty, was the master of the Meru Akshauhini, and the king, the protector of the nation, was the lord of half an Akshauhini. || 70 ||
Similarly, the king of the Sinhala country was the lord of an Akshauhini, and King Padmaratha, with an army equal in strength, was also the lord of half an Akshauhini. || 71 ||
The valiant Charudatta, the brother of Shakuni, who was always devoted to the welfare of Krishna, was the lord of a quarter of an Akshauhini. || 72 ||
The Barbarians, the Yamunas, the Abhiras, the Kambojas, the Dravida kings, and many other valiant warriors joined Krishna's side. || 73 ||
On the other side, King Jarasandha, who subdued the Bharatavarsha with the power of the Chakra Ratna, had many Akshauhini armies. || 74 ||
The measure of an Akshauhini army, with its proper proportions, is described as follows: || 75 ||
"Nine thousand elephants, nine hundred thousand chariots, nine crore horses, and nine hundred crore foot soldiers constitute an Akshauhini." || 76 ||
Among the Yadavas, Kumara Nemi, Balarama, and Krishna were the three Atiratha warriors. These three surpassed all the Atiratha warriors in the Bharatavarsha and were the best among them. || 77 ||
King Samudravijaya, Vasudeva, Yudhishthira, Bhima, Karna, Arjuna, Rukmi, Pradyumna, Satyaki, Dhrishtadyumna, Anavrushti, Shalya, Bhurisrava, King Hiranyabahu, Sahadeva, and Saran were all great chariot warriors. They were all skilled in weaponry and warfare, compassionate towards the helpless, immensely powerful, and possessed great courage. || 78-80 ||
Smaller than Samudravijaya, and

## Chapter Fifty-Fifth

Paundra, Padmaratha, Kapila, Magadatta, Kshemadhurta - all these were equal in strength and skill in battle. || 42 ||

Mahaneme, Dhara, Akrura, Nishadha, Ulmuka, Durmukha, Kritavarma, Varata, Charukrishna, Shakuni, Yavana, Manu, Dussasana, Shikhandi, Vahlika, Somadatta, Devasharma, Vaka, Venudari, and Vikranta - these kings were all Ardh-ratha (half-charioteers). They were all fierce warriors, skilled in battle, and never turned their backs on the fight. || 83-85 ||

Apart from these, all the kings who possessed wealth in the form of lineage, honor, and fame were known as Rathi (charioteers). They were present in both armies, as per their respective positions. || 86 ||

When the two armies, vast as the ocean, came face to face, Kunti was filled with anxiety. She quickly went to Karna, having been granted permission by her sons, Yudhishthira and the others. Her body was overwhelmed by the immense love she had for Karna, who was still a child in her eyes. She embraced him, weeping, and recounted the entire story of their relationship, from beginning to end. She also revealed that she had abandoned him at birth, wrapped in a blanket, out of fear of societal shame. || 87-89 ||

Karna knew the story of the blanket and was aware of his birth in the Kuru lineage. Now, hearing Kunti's words, he was certain that he was the son of Kunti and Pandu. || 90 ||

Having made his decision, Karna, along with all his wives, paid homage to Kunti. Then, with great respect, Kunti addressed her firstborn, Karna, saying, "My son, rise and come with me. All your brothers, along with Krishna and other loved ones, are anxiously waiting for you." || 91-92 ||

"My son, you are now the ruler of the Kuru dynasty on this earth. You are as dear to Krishna and Balarama as their own lives." || 93 ||

"You are the king, your younger brother Yudhishthira will hold the umbrella over you, Bhima will carry the fly whisk, Dhananjaya will be your minister, Sahadeva and Nakula will be your gatekeepers, and I, your mother, will always strive to serve your best interests." || 94-95 ||

1. Kritavarya, M.

Hearing his mother's words, Karna, though bound by brotherly affection, yet considering the favors done to him by Jarasandha, spoke, mindful of his duty to his master: "Parents, brothers, and relatives are very rare in the world. Though this is true, yet in this present situation, it would be improper, unpraiseworthy, and even laughable in the face of this impending war, to abandon the duty to my master and take up the cause of my brothers. At this time, I can only do so much as to fight in this war, along with other warriors, leaving my brothers behind, while fulfilling my duty to my master. If, by the grace of fate, we survive this war, then, O Mother, I am sure we shall meet our brothers. Go and inform them of this." Thus speaking, Karna paid homage to his mother Kunti, who went and did as he said.

Meanwhile, on the same battlefield, the army of King Jarasandha, led by skilled kings, had formed the Chakravyuha, a circular formation, to defeat their enemies. In this Chakravyuha, which was circular in shape, there were a thousand spokes, each spoke containing one king. Each king had a hundred elephants, two thousand chariots, five thousand horses, and sixteen thousand foot soldiers. At the edge of the Chakra, there were six thousand kings, with their elephants, horses, and foot soldiers in the same proportion as mentioned earlier. In the center of this Chakra, stood King Jarasandha himself, adorned with five thousand kings, including Karna. In the very center of this formation, stood the army of Gandhara and Sindhu, along with Duryodhana and a hundred Kauravas. The kings of the Madhyadesha (central region) were also stationed in the center. The remaining kings were stationed in the eastern part of the Chakra. Fifty valiant and powerful kings, the upholders of their lineage, were stationed at the junctions of the spokes, each with their own army. Between the spokes, there were groups of excellent warriors, each with their own distinct army. Outside the Chakra, there were various other formations of warriors.

Page #629:
---------------------------
## The Supreme Formation

The Chakravyuha, crafted by the clever Jarasandha, stood resplendent, a source of pride for his army and fear for the enemy.  ||11||

Witnessing this formation, Vasudeva, the master strategist, countered with the Garuda Vyūha to break it. ||12||

At the very mouth of this Garuda, stood fifty lakh Yadava Kumaras, valiant warriors, each wielding diverse weapons. ||13||

On its head, stood the mighty Balarama and Krishna, invincible heroes, steadfast like mountains. ||114||

Akrura, Kumuda, Vira, Saran, Vijaya, Jaya, Padma, Jaratkumara, Sumukha, Durmukha, Madanvega's son, the mighty charioteer Dridhamusti, Viduratha, and Anaavrusti, all sons of Vasudeva, were positioned as rearguards to protect Balarama and Krishna's chariots.  Bhoja, accompanied by a crore chariots, stood at the Garuda's back. ||115-117||

To protect Bhoja, Dharana, Sagara, and other valiant warriors were stationed. ||118||

On the right wing of the Garuda, stood Samudravijaya, surrounded by his mighty sons and a vast army. ||119||

Protecting this wing were the cunning, enemy-slaying Satyanemi, Mahanemi, Dridhanemi, Sunemi, the mighty charioteer Nami, Jayasena, Mahijaya, Tejasena, Jaya, Sena, Naya, Megha, Mahadyuti, and ten other Yadava kings, along with hundreds of other renowned kings, all accompanied by twenty-five lakh chariots. ||120-122||

On the left wing, stood Balarama's sons, the Pandavas, great souls and masters of warfare. ||123||

Near them stood Ulmuka, Nishadha, Prakrididyuti, Satyaki, Shatrudamana, Shridhvaja, Dhruva, King Dasharatha, Devananda, Shantanu, Ananda, Mahananda, Chandrananda, Mahabala, Prithu, Shatadhanu, Vipruthu, Yashodhana, Dridhabandha, and the best of all weapon-bearers. ||124-126||

Outside, numerous kings stood in various formations. ||110||

Thus, the Chakravyuha, crafted by the four clever kings, filled with pride for their own army and fear for the enemy, stood resplendent. ||111||

Page #630:
---------------------------
## Harivamsha Purana

These valiant princes, equipped with countless chariots, skilled in weapons and armor, were determined to slay the Kauravas in battle. || 127 || Behind them stood King Chandrayasha, Singhala, Varvara, Kamboja, Kerala, Kushala (Kosala), and Dramila, each with sixty thousand chariots. These powerful kings stood guard, protecting the Garuda. || 128-129 ||  

Besides them were Ashit, Bhanu, Tomar (a lover of war), Sanjay, Akalpita, Bhanu, Vishnu, Brihadhvaja, Shatrunjaya, Mahasena, Gambhira, Gautam, Vasudharma, Kritavarma, Prasenajit, Dridhavarma, Vikranta, and Chandravarma, each with their own armies, protecting Shri Krishna's Kalki. || 130-132 ||  

Within this Garuda formation, created by Vasudeva, stood the great chariot warriors, eager to break through Jarasandha's Chakravyuha. || 133 ||

Gautam Swami says, "Though both sides have skillfully created a difficult-to-enter Chakravyuha and a Garuda formation, I believe that only one leader will emerge victorious in this battle, guided by the path shown by the Jina and empowered by the accumulated merit of their Dharma." || 134 ||

Thus ends the fiftieth chapter of the Harivamsha Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which includes the collection of the Arishta-nemi Purana and describes the Chakravyuha and Garuda formations. || 50 ||

The One Hundred and First Chapter

The kings, beginning with Samudravijaya, arrived with their armies, all of them Vidyadharas, desiring the welfare of Vasudeva. ||1|| Among them were Asanivega, Vasudeva's father-in-law, Hari-griva, Varahaka, Singha-damstra, the king of birds, Vidyu-dvega, the great hero, Manasavega, Vidyu-damstra, the king of birds, King Pingala-Gandhara, Narasimha, and the king. ||2-3||  Along with them came many Aryas and Matangas, all of them Vidyadharas, desiring the welfare of Vasudeva. They placed Vasudeva at their head and went to meet Samudravijaya. ||4|| Samudravijaya and the others honored them appropriately and, with joyful hearts, said, "We are now fulfilled." ||5|| The Vidyadharas said, "This war will cause great anger among the enemies of Vasudeva, and they will come to help Jarasandha." ||6|| Hearing this, all the Yadavas consulted with each other and, to pacify the Vidyadharas, they sent Vasudeva, along with Pradyumna, Samba, and many of their sons, to the battlefield. ||7|| Vasudeva, embracing Jina-Keshava, Rama, and the others, quickly set out for the battlefield with his sons, grandsons, and Vidyadharas. ||8|| Balarama mounted the divine chariot of Singha-vidya, given by Kubera, and filled with divine weapons. ||9|| Krishna, with the banner of Garuda, mounted the chariot of Garuda-vidya, filled with various divine weapons and bringing victory. ||10||  And Jina-Keshava, mounted the chariot given by Indra, driven by the charioteer Matali, and filled with weapons, for the fulfillment of the Yadavas. ||11|| All the kings, beginning with Samudravijaya, anointed Anavrsti, the valiant son of Vasudeva, with the banner of the monkey, as the commander of the army. ||12||  On the other side, King Jarasandha, with great joy, quickly anointed the mighty King Hiranyanaabha as the commander of his army. ||13|| The drums and conch shells of both armies sounded loudly, and the four-armed forces of both sides prepared to fight each other. ||14||

Page #632:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, both sides, with their faces contorted in anger, challenged each other and prepared for battle.  The kings, with their brows furrowed in anger, were ready to fight.  Elephants clashed with elephants, horses with horses, chariots with chariots, and foot soldiers with foot soldiers.  The sound of the bows, the roar of the chariots, the trumpeting of the elephants, and the lion-like roars of the warriors filled all ten directions.  Seeing the enemy's strength, which was capable of destroying their own forces, the leaders of the Nemiparthe army, bearing the banners of the bull, the elephant, and the monkey, prepared to fight.  Knowing the intentions of Krishna, they were ready to fight and break through the Chakravyuha formation.  Nemishvara blew his conch, the Shakra, which filled the enemy with fear.  Prithaputra (Arjuna) blew his conch, the Devadatta, and the commander, Anavrushti, blew his conch, the Balahaka.  Hearing the sound of the conches, which filled the entire sky, the Pandava army was filled with great enthusiasm, while the enemy army was filled with great fear.  The commander, Anavrushti, broke through the center of the Chakravyuha, Nemishvara broke through the southern part, and Arjuna broke through the northwestern part, all within a moment.  The commander, Anavrushti, faced Jarasandha's commander, Hiranyanakha, Nemishvara faced Rukmi, and the valiant Duryodhana faced Arjuna.  Then, a great battle ensued between these heroes, who were filled with pride and rained down all five types of weapons.  Narade, the lover of conflict, stood in the sky with a group of Apsaras, showering flowers and dancing with joy.  Nemishvara, with a shower of arrows, brought down Rukmi, who had fought for a long time, and scattered thousands of enemy kings in the battle.  Similarly, the brothers, like Samudravijaya, and their sons, reached the battlefield and sent the enemies to their deaths.  The sons of Rama and Krishna, who rained down countless arrows, played at will among the enemies, like clouds pouring down heavy rain on mountains.  Who can describe the battle that took place between the Pandavas, with their sons, and the sons of Dhritarashtra?

## Chapter Fifty-One

595. Yudhishthira was fighting with Shalya, Bhima with Dushasana, Sahadeva with Shakuni, and Uluka with Nakula. ||30||

Then Duryodhana and Arjuna, skilled in wielding arrows, engaged in a fierce battle that terrified even the ghosts. ||31||

The Pandavas killed many sons of Dhritarashtra in the battle, and others like Duryodhana were rendered lifeless while still alive. ||32||

Karna, with his bow drawn to his ear, pierced many warriors of Krishna's side in the battle. ||33||

A fierce battle ensued between the two commanders, causing the destruction of many beings. ||34||

The valiant Hiranyabahu, with seven hundred and ninety arrows, wounded the Yadava commander Anaavrushti twenty-seven times. ||35||

Skilled in retaliation, Anaavrushti, in turn, wounded Hiranyabahu a hundred times with a thousand arrows. ||36||

Rudhira's son, Hiranyabahu, severed Anaavrushti's lofty flag, and Anaavrushti quickly pierced his bow, umbrella, and charioteer. ||37||

Taking up another bow, Hiranyabahu rained arrows, and Anaavrushti, throwing a mace, brought down his enemy's chariot. ||38||

Hiranyabahu, with sword and shield in hand, approached, and Anaavrushti, also with sword and shield, descended from his chariot and faced him. ||39||

Then, both commanders, skilled in parrying and delivering blows, engaged in a fierce sword fight. ||40||

Finally, Hiranyabahu struck Anaavrushti's arms with his deadly sword, severing both his arms, splitting his chest, and causing him to fall lifeless to the earth. ||41||

With the death of their commander, the four-armed army quickly fled and sought refuge with Jarasandha in the battle. ||42||

Then, Anaavrushti, praised by his soldiers, mounted his chariot and, pleased, went to Balarama and Krishna. ||43||

Balarama and Krishna, with their flags bearing the images of a bull, an elephant, and a monkey, were the breakers of the Chakravyuha, and they were mighty warriors. ||44||

Harivamsha Purana
The Magadha king's army, poisoned by the venom of sorrow, then quickly retreated to their abode as the sun set. The Yadava army, led by the Jina Shri, filled with immense joy and surging like a vast ocean, returned to their abode after the destruction of their enemies. ||45||
Thus ends the fifty-first chapter of the Harivamsha Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which is a collection of the Arishta-Nemipuraana and describes the slaying of Hiranyabahu. ||51||

## Chapter Fifty-Two

On the second day, as the sun illuminated the earth, Jarasandha and Krishna, with their respective armies, emerged ready for battle. ||1||

Both armies, arrayed in formations similar to the previous day, with numerous kings in their ranks, were eager to engage in mutual destruction. ||2||

From his chariot, Jarasandha, seeing the Yadavas, addressed his minister Hansaka, who stood nearby: "O Hansaka, tell me the names and identifying marks of each Yadava, so that I may recognize them. What good is killing others?" ||3-4||

Hansaka replied: "My lord, there, shining like the sun, is Krishna's chariot, drawn by white horses like foam, adorned with golden chains, and bearing the Garuda flag. ||5||

"There is the chariot of the valiant Arishtanemi, drawn by green horses like parrots, adorned with golden chains, and bearing the flag of a creeper. ||6||

"O King, there is the chariot of Balarama, adorned with golden and ruby ornaments, drawn by horses the color of the fruit of the soapnut tree, and bearing the flag of a palm tree. ||7||

"There, shining brightly, is the chariot of the commander-in-chief, drawn by black horses and bearing the flag of a monkey. ||8||

"There is the chariot of Yudhishthira, the son of Pandu, drawn by horses with blue necks and adorned with golden chains. ||9||

"There is the great chariot of Arjuna, drawn by white horses like the moon, swift as the wind, and bearing the flag of an elephant. ||10||

"There is the chariot of Bhima, drawn by horses the color of blue lotuses, adorned with jewels and gold. ||11||

"In the midst of the Yadava army, there is the chariot of Samudravijaya, drawn by red horses and bearing the flag of a lion. ||12||

"There is the chariot of the young Akrura, adorned with golden and ruby ornaments, drawn by strong horses, and bearing the flag of a banana tree. ||13||

## The Second Chapter of the Sarga

The sons of Jarasandha, filled with anger, engaged in a fierce battle with the Yadavas. They fought valiantly, their chariots and other vehicles clashing in a symphony of war.  ||28||

Kalayavana, the eldest son of Jarasandha, approached like Yama himself. Mounted on his elephant, Malaya, he fought with great ferocity. ||29||

Among the Yadavas, there were Sahadev, Dhrumsen, Dhrum, Jalachitra, Chitraketu, Dhanurdhar, Mahijay, Bhanu, Kanchanrath, Durdhar, Gandhamadana, Simhank, Chitramali, Mahipal, Brihaddhwaj, Suvir, Adityanag, Satyastva, Sudarshan, Dhanapal, Shatanik, Mahashukra, Mahavasu, Virakhya, Gangadatta, Pravar, Parthiv, Chitraangad, Vasugiri, Sriman, Singhkati, Sphut, Meghnad, Mahanad, Singhanad, Vasudhvaj, Vajranabha, Mahabahu, Jitshatru, Purandar, Ajit, Ajitshatru, Devanand, Shatadrut, Mandar, Himavan, Vidyutketu, Mali, Karkotak, Hrishikesh, Devadatta, Dhananjaya, Sagar, Swarnabahu, Madyavan, Achyut, Durjay, Durmukha, Vasuki, Kambal, Trishiras, Dharana, Malyavan, Sambhava, Mahapadma, Mahanag, Mahaseen, Mahajay, Vasav, Varuna, Shatanik, Bhaskar, Garutman, Venudari, Vasuveg, Shashiprabo, Varuna, Adityadharma, Vishnuswami, Sahasradik, Ketumali, Mahamali, Chandradev, Brihadbali, Sahasrarashmi, and Achishman. All these sons of Jarasandha attacked with great might. ||30-40||

In the midst of the battle, where men, elephants, horses, and chariots lay scattered, Kalayavana was surrounded by the sons of Vasudeva. ||41||

A fierce battle ensued between the Yadava princes and Kalayavana, each side seeking glory and hurling insults at the other. ||42||

Kalayavana, in his arrogance, used his chakra, naracha, and other weapons to sever the heads of many Yadava princes. The earth was stained with their blood, resembling a field of lotuses. ||43||

Seeing this, the prince Saran, filled with rage, struck Kalayavana with his sword, sending him to the abode of Yama. ||44||

**Note:** The text continues, but this is the end of the excerpt provided.

In the Harivamsha Purana, the sons of Magadha, who were enemies of Krishna, were valiant warriors. They were led to their deaths by Krishna, who severed their heads with his crescent-shaped arrows. ||45|| Then Jarasandha himself, filled with rage, aimed his bow at Krishna and charged towards him in his chariot. ||46|| The battle between these two mighty warriors, who were filled with animosity, was fierce and terrifying, with divine weapons being hurled at each other. ||47|| Jarasandha, in a hurry to kill Madhava, unleashed a Naga astra, a weapon that shone like a thousand fires. ||48|| The ever-vigilant Shouri, to counter the Naga astra, released the Garuda astra, which quickly devoured the Naga astra. ||49|| Jarasandha then released the Samvartaka astra, a weapon as terrifying as a storm cloud, but Madhava countered it with the Mahaashvasana astra, a powerful wind. ||50|| The Magadha king, skilled in the use of weapons, released the Vayavya astra, but the son of Vasudeva countered it with the Antariksha astra. ||51|| Jarasandha then unleashed the Agneya astra, a weapon capable of burning, but Shouri countered it with the Varuna astra. ||52|| The Magadha king, filled with rage, released the Vairochana astra, but Upendra countered it with the Maheindra astra. ||53|| In the battle, the enemy released a Rakshasa astra, but Narayana countered it with the Narayana astra, driving away the enemy. ||54|| Jarasandha then released the Tamasa astra, but Krishna countered it with the Maskara astra. Jarasandha then released the Ashvagriva astra, a very sharp weapon, but Krishna countered it with the Brahma shiras astra. ||55|| The enemy released many other divine weapons, but Vasudeva countered them all and remained steadfast, unharmed. ||56|| When all his efforts proved futile, Jarasandha threw his bow to the ground and contemplated the Chakra Ratna, protected by a thousand Yakshas. ||57||

Page #639:
---------------------------
## Chapter Fifty-Two

**601**
And then, the thousand-rayed, radiant Chakra, illuminating all directions, came to rest in Jarasandha's hand. ||58||

Enraged by the futility of his weapons, Jarasandha, his brow furrowed in a menacing frown, whirled the Chakra and hurled it swiftly towards Madhava. ||59||

As the Chakra, eclipsing the sun in its brilliance, sped through the sky, all the other kings of the Krishna-faction, each in their own way, launched their own Chakras to counter it. ||60||

Shanga wielded his Shakti and Gada, Balarama his Hal and Musala, Bhima his Gada, Arjuna, the king of weaponry, his various weapons, the commander-in-chief, his Parigha, and Yudhishthira, his Shakti, like a serpent. ||61-62||

Samudravijaya, Akshobhya, and their brothers, with utmost vigilance, unleashed their mighty weapons against the Chakra. ||63||

But Bhagavan Neminath, with his perfect knowledge of the future, remained steadfast, standing beside Krishna, facing the Chakra. ||64||

The Chakra, held back by the combined might of the kings' weapons, and radiating a shower of sparks, approached them like a friend, slowly. ||65||

Circumambulating Bhagavan Neminath and Hari, it came to rest in Krishna's right hand, adorned with the conch, Chakra, and Ankusha. ||66||

At that moment, the heavens resounded with the booming of drums, a shower of flowers descended, and the Devas proclaimed, "This is the ninth Narayana!" ||67||

A fragrant, auspicious breeze blew, and the weapons of the Yadava heroes rose with their hearts. ||68||

Seeing Krishna, the Chakra in his hand, in the midst of battle, Jarasandha thought, "Alas, this Chakra is also in vain!" ||69||

Overwhelmed by the Chakra and the might of Krishna, the ruler of the three realms, the mighty Jarasandha felt his strength shattered, his valor broken. ||70||

"As long as the power of the Devas is strong, the four-fold army, time, sons, friends, and valor are effective. ||71||

But when the Devas are weak, time, valor, and all else become meaningless..." This is what the wise say, and it is true, there is no other way. ||72||

**Note:** The translation preserves the Jain terms "Neminaath" and "Chakra" as requested.

Page #640:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana,
"I, Garmeshwara, was invincible even to the greatest of men. How is it that I am being defeated by a mere mortal who has been afflicted since his birth? (73)
If even such a common man was destined to defeat me, why was I subjected to so much hardship in Gokul during my childhood? This is a mockery of justice! (74)
This Lakshmi, who is skilled in blinding people, who destroys the courage and fortitude of even the bravest, and who desires to go to other men like a prostitute, is to be condemned! (75)
Having considered all this, Jarasandha was certain that his time of death had arrived. However, being fearless by nature, he said to Krishna, "You have thrown your discus, why are you ignoring time? You foolish one, he who ignores time, the long-winded, is sure to perish! (77)
Upon hearing this, Hari, who was naturally humble, replied, "I have been born a Chakravarti, so from this day forward, you shall remain under my rule. (78)
Although it is clear that you are intent on harming us, we, who are pleased by mere salutations, forgive your transgression. (79)
Jarasandha, filled with pride, retorted, "This discus is like a mere toy to me. Why are you so arrogant about it? (80)
Or perhaps, a man who has never seen prosperity becomes arrogant with even a little wealth, while a great man, who has seen prosperity, does not become arrogant even with great wealth. (81)
I will soon throw you into the sea, along with the Yadavas, this discus, and all the other kings who support you!" (82)
Upon hearing this, the Chakravarti Krishna, enraged, whirled his discus and hurled it. It swiftly flew and pierced through Jarasandha's chest, which was like a wall. (83)
The discus, having killed Jarasandha, returned to Krishna's hand in an instant. It is fitting, for when a task is completed, any further delay is pointless. (84)
Krishna blew his conch, Panchajanya, which was pleasing to the Yadavas. The sound of the conch, like the roar of a lion, echoed throughout the battlefield, and the lotus-like faces of the Yadavas were filled with joy. (85)"

## The Fifty-Second Chapter: The Slaying of Jarasandha

**The Sound of Instruments**

The sound of instruments, like the roar of a turbulent sea, filled the air.  Announcements of safety were made throughout the battlefield.  (86)

Both the armies of the Pandavas and the Kauravas, their fear dispelled, stood ready, obeying the commands of Vasudeva, without a word being spoken. (87)

King Duryodhana, Drona, Dusshasana, and others, renounced the world and took Jain initiation under the guidance of Vidura. (88)

Karna, at the end of the battle, received the liberating Jain initiation from the Damvara Muni in the garden called Sudarshan. (89)

The place where Karna left his earrings, adorned with golden letters, is known as Karna-Suvarna by the people. (90)

Matali, asking, "May I serve my master?", went to Indra. The Yadavas, along with the other kings, returned to their camps. (91)

**Earthly Verses**

Seeing Jarasandha slain in battle by Madhusudana, the sun, like a compassionate being, wept profusely, his face turning red like the petals of the Japa flower.  Then, desiring to offer water libations, he submerged himself in the ocean. (92)

Gotama Swami says:  These creatures of the world, when good deeds arise, obtain wealth that can conquer even the mightiest men.  But when good deeds decline, they suffer calamities.  Therefore, O devotees, be steadfast in the opinion of the people, and perform pure austerities, the cause of liberation. (93)

Thus ends the fifty-second chapter of the Harivamsa, composed by Jinaseena Acharya, which is a part of the collection of the Arishta-Nema Purana, and narrates the slaying of Jarasandha. (52)

---------------------------
## Chapter Fifty-Three

And thus, the Yadava army, with their wounds healed, rejoiced as the sun rose, its brilliance rivaling that of Hari, the Lord Krishna. Meanwhile, the final rites for Jarasandha and the other kings were performed.  

The kings, including Samudravijaya, were seated in the assembly hall, awaiting the arrival of Vasudeva. They discussed amongst themselves, wondering why they had not yet received news of Vasudeva, who had gone to Vijayadhan with his sons and grandsons. 

As they conversed, their hearts filled with love like a cow for her calf, and surrounded by children and elders, the sky lit up with the brilliance of numerous Vidyadharis, led by the swift Nagakumari. They arrived, showering blessings and declaring that the blessings of their Gurus had been fulfilled. Their son had vanquished Jarasandha, and their father had defeated the Vidyadharis. 

Vasudeva, accompanied by his sons and grandsons, was well and sending his regards to his elders, bowing to them and embracing his sons. 

Hearing this news, the kings, their hearts filled with joy, their bodies trembling with excitement, asked the Vidyadharis how Vasudeva had conquered them. 

The Nagakumari, devoted to the welfare of Vasudeva, replied, "Listen carefully to the prowess Vasudeva displayed in battle." 

Vasudeva, skilled in warfare, went to Vijayadhan and, uniting with his father-in-law and brother-in-law, the Vidyadharis, stopped the Vidyadharis who were coming here. 

Then, with his entire army, Vasudeva confronted the Vidyadharis in battle. They, abandoning their support for Jarasandha, engaged in combat.

## Chapter Fifty-Three

When the two armies clashed, the people were filled with fear and dread of annihilation. ||13||
As the battle between the warriors, horses, chariots, and elephants raged, both armies fought each other with righteous fury. ||14||
With his son, the valiant Pradyumna, and Shamba, along with the host of celestial beings, they unleashed fiery weapons, reducing the enemy kings to ashes, their movements swift and fierce like a raging fire. ||15-16||
Meanwhile, the pleased Devas proclaimed in the sky that the ninth Narayana, Krishna, the son of Vasudeva, had been born. He, the wielder of the discus, had slain Jarasandha, the enemy who harbored hatred for his virtues, in battle. ||17-18||
Having said this, the Devas showered Vasudeva's chariot with a rain of precious jewels, as bright as the moon. ||19||
Hearing this, the terrified enemy celestial beings sought refuge with Vasudeva, the immortal. ||20||
They offered their daughters to Vasudeva's sons, Pradyumna and Shamba, as a sign of their devotion. ||21||
"We have come to you at the behest of Vasudeva, to deliver this good news," they said. ||22||
Many celestial beings, adorned with various ornaments, accompanied by their king, came to Vasudeva, driven by their devotion to Narayana. ||23||
As long as Vanavati (the Naga princess) delivered this auspicious news, the sky was filled with the celestial chariots of the celestial beings. ||24||
Descending from their chariots, the followers of Vasudeva bowed to Balarama and Krishna, offering them various gifts. ||25||
Filled with devotion, Balarama and Narayana bowed to their father, who embraced them with affection and praised them. ||26||
Vasudeva paid his respects to all the elders, including the ocean-conqueror, and Pradyumna and others bowed to their elders and brothers as befitting their position. ||27||
All the celestial beings, who had been honored by Narayana and Balarama, considered their birth to be successful. ||28||

In the Harivamsha Purana, Balarama and Keshava, united with all their forces, set out towards the west, filled with joy and with all their desires fulfilled. ||29|| The place where the Yadavas danced in joy after the slaying of Jarasandha, became known as Anandapur, and was filled with Jain temples. ||30|| Then, adorned with all jewels, Hari, holding the Chakra jewel, conquered the southern Bharat Kshetra, along with the Devas, Asuras, and humans. ||31|| Krishna, who was served by the desired objects for eight consecutive years, and who had conquered all the conquerable kings, went towards the Kotik Shila. ||32|| Since countless crores of Muniraj attained Siddhahood on that excellent Shila, it is known as Kotik Shila in the world. ||33|| Krishna first performed worship on that sacred Shila, and then lifted it four angulas above the ground with both his arms. ||34|| That Shila is one yojana high, one yojana long, and one yojana wide, and is protected by all the Devas residing in the half of Bharat Kshetra. ||35|| First, Triprishtha Narayana lifted the Shila as high as his arms could reach. Second, Dwiprashtha lifted it up to his head. Third, Swayambhu lifted it up to his neck. Fourth, Purushottama lifted it up to his chest. Fifth, Narasimha lifted it up to his heart. Sixth,  Pundarika lifted it up to his waist. Seventh, Dattaka lifted it up to his thighs. Eighth, Lakshmana lifted it up to his knees. And ninth, Krishna Narayana lifted it four angulas above the ground. ||36-38|| Because, due to the difference in time in each Yuga, the power of all powerful humans, starting from the Pradhan Purusha, has been different. ||39|| Seeing the strength of the Shila, all the forces realized that Krishna was endowed with great physical strength. Then, Krishna, the wielder of the Chakra jewel, returned to Dwaraka with his companions. ||40|| There, Krishna Narayana, who was welcomed with various blessings by the elders, entered Dwarakapuri, which was adorned with beautiful Gopuras and was as beautiful as heaven. ||41|| The Bhoomigochari and the Vidhyadhara kings, who were worthy and suitable, were stationed in the palaces of Dwaraka, as per the rules. ||42||

## Chapter Fifty-Three

The kings of the earth and the celestial beings crowned Balarama and Krishna, proclaiming them as the rulers of half the Bharata-kshetra. [43]

Krishna, the wielder of the chakra, established Sahadev, the second son of Jarasandha, as the king of Rajagriha and bestowed upon him a quarter of the Magadha kingdom. [44]

He gave Mathura to the son of Ugrasena, and Shaurya-nagar to Mahanemi. [45]

Krishna, with love, gave Hastinapur to the Pandavas and Kosala to Rukmanabha, the son of Rudhira. [46]

The chakra-pani, Krishna, established all the kings of the earth and the celestial beings in their rightful places. [47]

The Pandavas and others, having taken leave of Krishna, departed to their respective places, and the Yadavas, like the gods, enjoyed themselves in Dwaraka. [48]

**Vasantatilaka**

The Sudarshana chakra, which never saw the face of an enemy, the Sharanga bow, which shook the enemy ranks with its sound, the Saunandaka sword, the Kaumudi mace, the Amoghmoola Shakti, which never failed against enemies, the Panchajanya conch, and the Kaustubha gem, which displayed immense power, were the seven gems of Krishna, marked with the conch symbol. These seven gems, worshipped by the gods, were extremely beneficial and adorned with divine forms. [49-50]

The divine plough named Aparajita, the divine mace, the divine club, the divine Shakti, and the divine garland were the five gems of Balarama, who effortlessly destroyed the confusion of the enemy ranks. These five gems of Balabhadra were also worshipped by the gods. [51]

The half-chakra-bearing Krishna, with his sixteen thousand chieftains, who were knowledgeable in virtues, and eight thousand others, who were worthy of respect, were accompanied by their respective possessions and were settled in the palaces of Dwaraka with peace of mind. [42]

Page #646:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, the Bhaktas (devotees), the Gana-baddha Devas (Jain celestial beings), and the Ajnakaris (obedient ones) served Him (Lord Krishna) with pleasure. ॥52॥ He (Lord Krishna) was served by sixteen thousand beautiful celestial maidens, who captivated the mind with their charming movements, like the Shangis (Jain celestial beings). Along with them, eight thousand excellent women served Balarama, and they all enjoyed conjugal bliss with their respective spouses. ॥53॥ The Yadavas, who were devoted to the Jain faith, enjoyed sensual pleasures in suitable places in Dvaraka during the seasons of Hemanta (winter), Shishira (cool), Vasanta (spring), Grishma (summer), Varsha (monsoon), and Sharad (autumn), accompanied by their beloved young women. They were free from any interruption in their passion and attachment. ॥54॥

In the Harivamsha Purana, the celestial being brought Draupadi to the city of Padma-nabha during the night. ||13|| After bringing her there, he left her in the garden of the palace and informed King Padma-nabha. King Padma-nabha went and saw Draupadi, the celestial maiden, in person. ||14|| Although Draupadi had awakened from her Sarvatobhadra bed and was sleepless, she kept on sleeping again and again, suspecting that it was a dream. ||15|| Knowing the intention of Draupadi, who had closed her eyes, King Padma-nabha slowly approached her and spoke sweet words. ||16|| He said, "O, wide-eyed one! Look, this is not a dream. O, Ghatastani! This is the island of Dhataki-khanda, and I am King Padma-nabha." ||17|| "Narada had told me about your beautiful form, and the god I worship brought you here for me." ||18|| Hearing this, her heart was filled with fear, and she said, "What is this?" She thought, "Alas! This unbearable sorrow has come upon me." ||19|| She decided, "Until I see Arjuna, I will not eat," and she tied her hair in a way that could be undone by Arjuna. ||20|| Then, Draupadi, who was within the fortress of her character, spoke to King Padma-nabha, who was tormented by desire, saying, ||21|| "Balarama and Krishna-Narayana are my brothers, Arjuna, the archer, is my husband, Bhima, the elder brother of my husband, is a great warrior, and Sahadeva and Nakula, the younger brothers of my husband, are like Yama." ||22|| "Their chariots, which cannot be stopped by any means, travel all over the earth, like desires, on land and water." ||23|| "Therefore, O King! If you want your own well-being, along with your brothers and relatives, then quickly send me back, like a serpent." ||24|| When Padma-nabha, whose other desires had been extinguished, did not give up his desire even after Draupadi said this, then Draupadi, who was quick to think according to the situation, replied firmly, ||25|| "O King! If my loved ones do not come here within a month, then do whatever you wish with me." ||26|| Saying, "So be it," Padma-nabha kept her company, surrounded by his wives, trying to charm her. ||27||

## Chapter Forty-Five

Having lost all hope and become confused, Draupadi remained in a state of despair, her eyes constantly filled with tears. She abandoned all pleasures and sustenance, her gaze fixed on the path her husband had taken. ||28||

The five Pandavas were bewildered and deeply distressed when Draupadi suddenly disappeared. They were at a loss as to what to do. ||29||

Despairing, they went to Krishna and informed him of the situation. Hearing this, Krishna, along with the Yadavas, was filled with sorrow. He immediately ordered the news to be spread throughout the entire Bharat Kshetra. ||30||

When no trace of Draupadi was found in Bharat Kshetra, they concluded that some petty-minded person had abducted her and taken her to another region. The Yadavas, with unwavering determination, set out to find her. ||31||

One day, while Krishna was seated in the assembly hall, Narada arrived. The Yadavas welcomed him with great respect. Narada, with a cheerful countenance, revealed the news: "I have seen Draupadi in the Amarakankapura of the Dhataki Khanda island, in the house of King Padma. Her body is dark and frail, her eyes constantly overflowing with tears. The women of King Padma's inner palace are diligently attending to her." ||32-34||

"Her only solace is her adherence to her vows, and she sighs deeply. Why is she staying in the house of an enemy, when you, her brothers, are alive?" ||35||

Upon receiving this news of Draupadi, Krishna and the others were overjoyed. They praised Narada, who had brought them both good and bad news. ||36||

"Where will that wicked man go after abducting Draupadi? I will send that evil-minded, death-desiring wretch to Yama's abode." ||37||

Thus, expressing his hatred for the enemy, Krishna resolved to bring Draupadi back. He boarded his chariot and set off towards the southern coast. ||38||

Reaching there, he, along with the Pandavas, worshipped the Lord of the Salt Ocean, who was steadfast in his vows, with the desire to obtain the Dhataki Khanda island. ||39||

The Lord of the Salt Ocean, accompanied by six chariots, took Krishna and the five Pandavas towards the ocean, carrying the weight of the Dhataki Khanda island. ||40||

In the Harivamsha Purana,
The Amarakanka city, outside its gardens, was besieged. Krishna and his companions informed Padma Nabha, the king, of their arrival. ||41||
His proud army, with its four divisions, marched out of the city, but the five Pandavas defeated it in battle, forcing it to retreat back into the city. ||42||
The king, a wise ruler, closed the city gates and remained inside. When the Pandavas could not breach the gates, Krishna, filled with anger, used his feet to break them down. His blows were like those of a thunderbolt. He shattered the entire city, both inside and out, causing the walls and gates to crumble. Palaces and halls collapsed, sending maddened elephants and horses running in all directions. The city was filled with the sound of chaos and people fled in terror. ||43-45||
Despairing and terrified, the treacherous king Padma Nabha, along with his citizens and the women of his inner palace, rushed to Draupadi for refuge. He bowed low and pleaded, "Oh Devi! You are like a deity, gentle and devoted to your husband. Forgive me, a sinner, forgive me! Grant me protection!" ||46-47||
Draupadi, full of compassion, said to the king seeking refuge, "Go, disguised as a woman, to the refuge of the Chakravarti, Krishna." For noble men are often merciful to those who seek their forgiveness, even if they are guilty. And they are even more merciful to those who are fearful or who disguise themselves as such. ||48-49||
Hearing this, the king Padma Nabha disguised himself as a woman, took his women with him, and with Draupadi leading the way, went to Krishna's refuge. ||50||
Krishna, who always protected those who sought his refuge, granted him safety and allowed him to return to his place, but changed his name and the name of his place. ||51||
Draupadi, after inquiring about his well-being, bowed to Krishna's feet and, along with the five Pandavas, showed him due respect. ||52||
Then Arjuna, embracing his beloved, who was suffering from separation, wiped away her tears with his own hands and loosened her braid. ||53||

613. Having bathed, eaten, and entertained their guests with all their hearts, the Pandavas, along with Draupadi, expressed their grief and then, with tears, let go of all their sorrow. 

54.  After that, Krishna, having seated Draupadi in his chariot, arrived at the seashore and blew his conch in such a way that its sound filled all directions.

55.  At that time, Kapila, the Vasudeva, who was outside the city of Champa, going to pay homage to the Jina, heard the earth-shaking sound of the conch and asked the Jina: "O Lord! Who, with power equal to mine, has blown this conch? There is no one in this Bharat-kshetra, ruled by me, who is my equal."

56-57.  The Jina, who answers all questions, told him the truth.  Desiring to see Krishna, Kapila started to leave.  Seeing this, the Jina said: "O King! In the three worlds, there is never a meeting of Chakravartis with Chakravartis, Tirthankaras with Tirthankaras, Balabhadra with Balabhadra, Narayana with Narayana, and Pratinarayana with Pratinarayana.  If you go, you will only be able to meet him through signs.  Hearing each other's conch sounds and seeing each other's chariot flags will be the signs of your meeting."

58-60.  Following the Jina's words, Kapila, aiming for Krishna, arrived and, from a distance, met Krishna on the sea, as the Jina had said.

61.  Returning to Champa, Kapila, filled with anger, severely rebuked Padma-nabha, the king of Amarakankapura, for his inappropriate actions.

62.  Krishna and the Pandavas, as before, quickly crossed the great ocean and arrived at this shore.  Krishna rested there, but the Pandavas continued on.

63.  The Pandavas, having crossed the Ganga by boat, stopped on the southern bank.  Bhima, who loved to play, hid the boat on the shore after crossing.

64.  When Krishna, along with Draupadi, arrived, he asked, "How did you cross the Ganga?"

65.  Vrikodara, without any curiosity, replied, "We crossed it."  Krishna, believing his words to be true, was eager to hear more.

Having lifted the chariot with his hand, along with the horses and charioteer, Achyuta crossed the Ganga. As if it were a mere ankle-deep stream, he crossed it with his arm and two thighs. ||6||
Then, those who were astonished and delighted, approached him with joyful voices and good intentions. They were amazed by his power, and, overwhelmed with praise, embraced the son of Vasudeva. ||6||
Vansh-sthavritta, himself, made a joke, and then, the valiant Bhima, himself, spoke to the world-renowned Krishna. "This was just a joke," he said. "Krishna, you are becoming too detached. Jokes are not appropriate without regard for time and place." ||6||
"O despicable Pandavas," Krishna rebuked them, "I have performed many inhuman acts in this world, even in your presence. What is there in crossing this Ganga that could test my abilities?" ||7||
Having spoken thus to the Pandavas, Janardana, along with them, went to Hastinapur. He gave the kingdom to the son of Subhadra, Arya-sunu, and, in anger, dismissed the Pandavas. ||7||
Then, Krishna, accompanied by all his vassals and followers, who had welcomed him with great enthusiasm, entered the great city of Dwarka and delighted his group of wives. ||72||
Following the order of Krishna Chandra, who was as harsh as a thunderbolt, the Pandavas, along with their loyal followers, went to the south and established the city of Mathura there. ||73||
There, they enjoyed themselves on the beautiful shores of the ocean, filled with the fragrant air of cloves and black musk, and on the high peaks of the Malaya mountain, which perfumed the directions with the scent of sandalwood. ||74||

**Fast and Slow Meter**

Then, adorned with garments, ornaments, garlands, and unguents sent by Kubera, the young Nemikumar, surrounded by renowned kings, moved with the graceful gait of an intoxicated elephant. He went to the assembly called Kusumachitra, filled with countless Yadavas like Balarama and Narayana. The kings, rising from their seats, went forward and bowed to him. Krishna also came forward to welcome him. Then, together with Krishna, he adorned the seat. The throne, presided over by Krishna and Nemikumar, shone with a splendor equal to that of two Indras or two lions.  

In the midst of the assembly, Nemikumar, who drank the nectar of the words of the noble ones, and who was adorned with great valor and physical prowess, spent a moment with Krishna, worshipped by many kings, whose radiance eclipsed all.

Then, when the discussion of the strong began, some praised Arjuna, some praised Yudhishthira, who remained steadfast in battle, some praised the valiant Bhima, and some praised the arrogant Sahadeva and Nakula. Some said that Balarama was the strongest, while others said that Krishna, who lifted the invincible Govardhana mountain and who, eager to show his strength, held a bow to displace the group of kings from their seats, was the strongest.

Hearing such words spoken by the kings who had come to the assembly, the Lord, with a playful gaze, looked towards Nemikumar and said, "In the three worlds, there is no one equal to him."

Page #655:

Chapter Fifty-Five:

"Who is the supreme, immortal Jina, who can lift the earth with his palm, swiftly move the oceans in all directions, and shake the mountain king with disdain?" ||8||

Hearing these words, Hari, with a smiling face, addressed the Lord, "Why, O Lord, is your great strength not tested in a duel?" ||9||

The Jina, looking up at Krishna, said, "What need have I for a wrestling match? If you wish to know the strength of my arms, then move my foot from this seat." ||10||

With a desire to conquer the Jina, Hari, with all his might, tried to move the foot, but he was unable to move even the toe, which held the moon-like nail. ||11||

His body was drenched in sweat, and he breathed heavily. Finally, he relinquished his pride and said, "O Lord, your strength is extraordinary and miraculous." ||12||

At that moment, Indra's seat trembled, and he immediately came with the gods, worshipped, praised, and bowed to the Lord, then returned to his place. ||13||

The Jina, the moon-like one who had destroyed Krishna's pride, surrounded by many kings, went to his palace. Krishna, doubting himself, also went to his palace. It is true that those with confused minds doubt even the Jinas. ||14||

From that day on, Hari, with respect and reverence, worshipped the Jina, the moon-like one, who was superior in every way. ||15||

Jain terms preserved in the translation:

In the Harivamsha Purana, in the northern part of Vijayanagarapura, there was a city called Shrutashonita. There lived a proud and arrogant Vidyadhara named Bana. \\16\\ Bana's daughter was Usha, who was the daughter of the lord of birds. She had heard about the virtuous qualities of Pradyumna's son Aniruddha and had kept him in her heart for a long time. \\17\\ Though Aniruddha had a very delicate body, he had adopted the crooked behavior of Usha with her curved eyebrows, and thus he had caused great distress to his own body. \\18\\ Though the young Usha did not express her great anguish to anyone else, she had become extremely weak internally. One night, her friend took Aniruddha, the best of the Khacharas (celestial beings), to the world of the Khacharas, which was the abode of Manmatha (the god of love). \\19\\ When the young Aniruddha woke up in the morning, he found himself lying on a soft bed in a palace adorned with jewels. As soon as he woke up, he saw a maiden. \\20\\ That maiden had a large bosom and full breasts, a slender waist, and was adorned with a triple necklace. She was captivating the minds of the virtuous people and was the repository of amorous sentiments. \\21-22\\ Aniruddha wondered, "Who is this excellent woman who is captivating my mind? Is she the wife of Indra or a Naga-vadhu (serpent-woman)? For I have never seen such a human woman anywhere." \\23\\ This place also appears to be extraordinary, like the abode of Indra. Is this real or unreal? Indeed, the mind of the sleeping ones wanders in this world.

Thus, having understood the situation perfectly, she (Rukmini) reconciled him (Krishna) with her. In private, she had the girl (Satyabhama) bound with a bracelet, knowing that she was a skilled writer of letters, etc. ||24||

Like a couple who constantly drink the nectar of love, their time passed happily. When Krishna learned of the abduction of Aniruddha, he, along with Balarama, Samba, Pradyumna, and other Yadavas, set out for the city of the Vidhyadharas, the king of the birds, Bana, by air. ||25-26||

In a battle filled with men, horses, chariots, and elephants, he conquered the king of the birds, Bana, and brought back Aniruddha, along with his wife, Ushas, to his own city. ||27||

Then, with the reunion of Aniruddha, the sorrow of separation vanished for everyone, and all the people, the foundation of all happiness, enjoyed themselves with their families and friends. ||28||

Later, when spring arrived, Krishna, along with his wives, the beloved Lord Neminatha, the kings, and the citizens, who were like an ocean, went to the Girnar mountain, where the groves were blooming, with the desire to enjoy themselves. ||29||

Lord Neminatha, Balarama, and Krishna, adorned with beautiful ornaments, including white umbrellas, and banners depicting bulls, palm trees, and Garuda, rode in large chariots drawn by horses, one after the other. ||30||

Behind them, Pradyumna, surrounded by the ten Yadava princes, including Samudravijaya, rode in a chariot drawn by elephants and horses, delighting the people with arrows of flowers, bows, and banners marked with the sign of the Makara (sea monster). ||31||

Behind them, the citizens, adorned with various clothes and ornaments, rode in the best vehicles, according to their status. And behind them, Krishna, along with his wives, followed in palanquins and other vehicles. ||32||

In the Harivamsha Purana, this mountain was adorned by the people and possessed beautiful gardens. It was also adorned by the celestial maidens of the divine mountain (Sumeru). ||33||
The entire populace quickly descended from their respective vehicles and began to wander in the forests on the slopes of the mountain as they wished. ||34||
The cool southern breeze, free from the fatigue caused by the pollen of the spring flowers, was blowing, and the exertion of the people had been relieved. ||35||
The melodious cuckoos, intoxicated by the rasa (juice) of the mango creepers, were chirping on the mountain, unable to captivate the minds of the people. ||36||
The Kuruvaka and Vakula trees, adorned by the multitudes of honey-drinking bees, were enhancing the beauty of the region with the sounds of the bipeds (birds) and the hexapods (insects). ||37||
The intoxicated bees, abandoning their abode in the fragrant elephant-goad-like flowers, had taken shelter in the new clusters of the Saha-kara (mango) trees, where their great passion (for the flowers) arose. ||38||
The trees, bowing down excessively due to the weight of the flowers, appeared as if they were bending down due to the breaking of their love (for the flowers). The young women, shaking the clusters of flowers, experienced a delicate pleasure, like that of young men. ||39||
Somehow, the trees, with their own branches made accessible by the women, enjoyed the pleasure of grasping the flowers, like a lord (enjoying the pleasure) of being grasped by the hair. ||40||

Panchapanchasah Sargah

The young man, the companion of the lady, enjoyed the pleasure of wandering in the forest for a long time. The youthful man enjoyed the nectar of love-making on the beds made of flower clusters. (41)

The fortunate people enjoyed the pleasures of the senses, wandering from one forest, thicket, creeper-house, tree, and pond to another. (42)

The moon-like Sri Krishna, who was adorned with the multitude of eight thousand wives, brought the most sweet and charming Vasanta (spring) season. (43)

The women, whose minds were robbed of their modesty, following the command of their husband (Sri Krishna), enjoyed in the beautiful forests along with the lord Neminatha. (44)

A woman, whose mind and eyes were languid with the intoxication of honey, was surrounded by humming bees attracted by the fragrance of her face, and she caught hold of lord Neminatha out of fear. (45)

One woman was kissing him on his chest, another was touching him, another was smelling him, and another, holding his soft hand, was turning his moon-like face towards herself. (46)

Some were fanning him with the small branches of Sala and Tamala trees, as if with fans, and some were adorning him with the new leaves of the Ashoka tree, as if with a crown. (47)

One was placing a garland made of various flowers on his head out of the desire to embrace him, another was putting it around his neck, and another was showering Kuruvaka flowers on his head. (48)

Thus, the young Neminatha, enjoying with the wives of Krishna, was experiencing the endless pleasure of the spring season, and he was being served like a master. (49)

## Chapter 622

**50.**  Every day, Hari (Krishna) resided on the Raivatak mountain, which was like a cool nectar in the scorching heat, as it was a source of joy and adorned with cool waterfalls.

**51.**  Although naturally averse to the pollen of passion, due to the insistence of his wives, the Tirthankara (Neminaath) engaged in water sports in the cool, water-filled reservoir.

**52.**  The wives of the Yadu king, filled with joy, sometimes swam, sometimes dived deep, and sometimes playfully splashed water on each other's faces with water-spouting devices.

**53.**  When they began to splash water on the Lord with their cupped hands and water-spouting devices, he quickly retaliated, driving them away like the ocean repelling rivers with its powerful waves.

**54.**  This unique bath was not only a source of joy and delight for the people, but also colored the water with the fragrance of various fragrant ointments that spread throughout the area.

**55.**  Just as a group of playful elephants, with their trunks churning the lotuses, remain in the water for a long time with a great elephant, so too did the group of young women, with their hands churning the lotuses, remain in the water for a long time. This water sport dispelled all their fear of the summer sun.

**56.**  Their earrings had fallen, their tilak had faded, their anxiety had increased, their eyes had become restless, their lips had turned pale, their belts had loosened, and their hair had come undone, giving them a beauty akin to that of a woman in the throes of love.

**57.**  Then, adorned with ornaments brought by their attendants, the women, filled with joy, wiped the Lord's body with clothes and dressed him in new garments.

Page #661:

## Chapter Fifty-Five

The Lord, who had just shed his wet garments, with a playful glance, urged Jambavati, the beloved of Krishna and a peerless beauty, to wring them out. || 58 ||

Understanding the Lord's intention, Jambavati, swift and adept at crafting words, with feigned anger, cast a reproachful glance, her lips trembling, and with expressive eyebrows, looked at the Lord and said: || 59 ||

He whose body and crown are adorned with jewels whose brilliance surpasses that of millions of serpents' gems, who is resplendent with the Kaustubha gem, who, mounted on the great serpent-bed, fills the world with the thunderous sound of his conch, who is adorned with a blue hue like water, who wields the mighty bow called Shanga, who is the lord of all kings, and who has many auspicious and beautiful wives, is my lord. But even he would never give me such an order. You, however, seem to be a strange man, commanding me to wring out wet garments. || 60-62 ||

Hearing Jambavati's words, many of Krishna's wives responded: "Shameless one! Why do you slander the Lord Jinendra, the master of the three worlds and the possessor of infinite virtues?" || 63 ||

Hearing Jambavati's words, Lord Neminatha, smiling, said: "How difficult is this prowess of King Krishna that you describe?" Saying this, he swiftly went towards the city and quickly entered the royal palace. || 64 ||

He ascended the great serpent-bed of Krishna, adorned with the hoods of swaying serpents. He doubled the Shanga bow and strung it, and filled the conch of the Lord. || 65 ||

Harivamsha Purana
The mouths of all the directions, the entire sky, the ocean, the earth, and everything else were filled with the sound of the conch shell. It seemed as if everything had burst open due to the sound of the conch. || 66 ||
The elephants, filled with excessive pride, broke their chains in anger and ran around. The horses, breaking their bonds, neighed and ran around the city. || 67 ||
The peaks and edges of the buildings were falling apart. Hari drew his sword. The entire assembly was agitated, and the people of the city, fearing the arrival of the apocalypse, were filled with fear. || 68 ||
When Hari realized that the sound was from his own conch, he quickly went to the armory and, seeing Nemikumara standing on the shining serpent bed with disrespect, he was surprised along with the other kings. || 69 ||
As soon as Hari realized that the Kumar had done this act out of anger due to Jambavati's harsh words, he felt great joy along with his relatives. At that time, the Kumar's anger was also a source of great joy for Hari. || 70 ||
Along with his relatives, Hari embraced the young Nemikumara and honored him greatly. After that, he went home. When he realized that he was aroused by his wife, he was even more delighted. || 71 ||
Hari requested the daughter of the Bhojvanshi lineage, Rajimati, for Neminath, sent word to his relatives for the hand-grasping ceremony, and invited all the kings, along with their wives, with great respect and brought them close to him. || 72 ||
At that time, the groom and bride, who had been bathed according to the time, who were adorned with the supreme form, who were wearing the best ornaments, and who were situated in their respective homes in their respective cities, were captivating the minds of the people. || 73 ||

As if fearing the arrival of the rainy season, the summer season vanished from the earth. A canopy of clouds covered the sky, which the travelers in the desert, parched with thirst, looked upon with great dejection. ||74||

The first thunderous roar of the clouds and the cool drops of rain, which were a source of joy for peacocks and cuckoos, were unbearable for all the heartbroken humans on earth, who were suffering from double the heat. ||75||

As the clouds began to rain in the month of Shravan, the vapor and fragrant aroma rising from the forest, scorched by the fire and the sun, seemed as if the forest was exhaling in joy and relief at the sight of its friend, the cloud. ||76||

As the clouds, adorned with the bow of Indra (the rainbow), showered arrows (rain) accompanied by lightning and the wind, the earth, filled with hundreds of Indra's guards (rain clouds), seemed as if it was filled with the hearts of fallen travelers. ||77||

All directions were adorned with blooming Kutaja, Kadamba, and Koha trees, making the entire land, including forests, mountains, and hills, beautiful with the new leaves of the Shili Indra trees. ||78||

Frightened by the thunderous roar of the clouds, young women embraced their husbands tightly, the sound of their bangles clashing against each other, suppressing their fear, which was like a demon. ||79||

The sages, who had been practicing the three types of yoga (heat, rain, and cold), were relieved from the heat of the sun on the rocks of the mountains. They took shelter under the trees and vines, enduring the cold wind and rain. ||80||

During this rainy season, one day, young Nemikumar, riding a chariot adorned with flags and banners, like the chariot of the sun, set out for the forest. ||81||

**Notes:**

* **Shili Indra:** A type of tree mentioned in ancient Indian texts.
* **Koha:** A type of tree, also known as "Koha" in Hindi.
* **Indra's guards:** A metaphorical term for rain clouds, as Indra is the god of rain in Hindu mythology.
* **Three types of yoga:** Refers to the practice of yoga in different seasons, adapting to the changing weather conditions.

## Chapter 626 of the Harivamsha Purana

**Verse 82:**  
With a heart filled with compassion, the Lord Neminath, accompanied by the princes, moved slowly along the wide royal path, his captivating presence captivating the hearts of the onlookers. The women of the city, their eyes thirsty for a glimpse of him, drank in the water of his form, their hearts filled with joy.

**Verse 83:** 
The ocean, with its waves like dancing arms, roared with a symphony of sound. As the Lord approached, it adorned itself with various dances, becoming even more beautiful, like a dancer adorned with different dances in the presence of a great king.

**Verse 84:** 
Upon reaching the grove, the young Neminath quickly beheld the beauty of the forest. The trees, with their branches outstretched like arms, bowed low, showering him with a garland of flowers.

**Verse 85:** 
At that moment, he saw in the forest, a group of herbivorous animals, trembling with fear, their minds and bodies shaking. They were surrounded by men, and their various species were in a state of utter confusion.

**Verse 86:** 
Though the Lord, with his omniscience, knew the reason for their gathering, he quickly stopped his chariot, his voice conquering the thunderous sound of the clouds. He asked his charioteer, "Why are these animals of various species being held here?"

**Verse 87:** 
The charioteer, bowing low with folded hands, said, "O Lord! These animals have been captured for the preparation of various types of meat for the carnivorous kings who have come for your wedding celebration."

**Verse 88:** 
Hearing this, the Lord, his heart overflowing with compassion for all beings, looked at the group of deer. He, the omniscient one, addressed the princes, saying, "The forest is their home, grass and water their food and drink, and they are completely innocent. Yet, humans in this world kill them. Oh, the cruelty of humans!"

**Verse 89:** 
The Lord, with his chariot drawn by four shining horses, continued his journey towards the forest, accompanied by the princes.

## Chapter 55: The Five Evils

**Verse 10:**  
On the battlefield, valiant warriors, adorned with the glory of victory, mounted on elephants, horses, and chariots, fearlessly strike only those who stand before them, never the innocent.

**Verse 9:**  
Those who, filled with rage, drive away the fierce Sharabha, lion, and wild elephant herds, but strike down the deer and hare, these small creatures, why do they not feel shame?

**Verse 92:**  
Ah! Those warriors who wear shoes to avoid the pain of thorns on their feet, yet in the hunt, strike down gentle deer with hundreds of sharp weapons, this is truly astonishing.

**Verse 93:**  
The killing of deer herds, this despicable act, initially yields the fruit of worldly pleasures. But when its taste begins to manifest, it leads to the suffering of the six senses, one after another.  The meaning is that a violent being is born among the six-sensed beings and is killed there by various beings.

**Verse 94:**  
This human, desiring a vast kingdom, engages in the killing of all beings. This is contradictory, for the fruit of killing is surely the bondage of sin, leading to bitter consequences, not the sweet fruits of a kingdom.

**Verse 95:**  
Bound by the four types of bondage: nature, region, state, and experience, this group of beings wanders through the realms of misery, experiencing various kinds of suffering.

**Verse 96:**  
In every birth, this being is influenced by worldly pleasures, tainted with fear and sorrow, and even in this human birth, so deeply deluded, it does not strive to end worldly suffering.

**Verse 97:**  
Just as hundreds of rivers do not bring satisfaction to the ocean, so too, worldly pleasures, born from external objects, bound by lineage, and immensely heavy, do not bring satisfaction to the being.

**Notes:**

* **Sharabha:** A mythical creature, often depicted as a lion with wings.
* **Six Senses:** The six senses in Jainism are sight, smell, taste, touch, hearing, and mind.
* **Bondage:** In Jainism, bondage refers to the cycle of birth and death, caused by karma.
* **Nature:** Refers to the inherent nature of a being, which determines its karma.
* **Region:** Refers to the realm of existence in which a being is born.
* **State:** Refers to the mental and physical condition of a being.
* **Experience:** Refers to the actions and experiences of a being, which create karma.

In the Harivamsha Purana, King Ksharadeva was born in the Jayanta Vimana, which originated from the celestial realm. I have experienced the pleasures of life in the oceans, among the Vidyadharas, Devas, and Naras, but none of it has truly satisfied me. ||98|| Even though I have access to extraordinary pleasures, they are fleeting, ephemeral, and my lifespan is also impermanent. How can they truly satisfy me? ||99|| Therefore, I will abandon this perishable and painful worldly pleasure and embark on a great endeavor. Through intense tapasya, I will attain the eternal, non-suffering, self-born liberation, the supreme bliss. ||100|| While the Lord was contemplating this in his mind and speech, the Laukantika Devas, born in the fifth heaven, radiant like the moon, including Tusita, Agni, Aruna, and Surya, arrived swiftly. They bowed their heads, folded their hands, and pleaded, "O Lord! This is the time to establish a Tirtha in the Bharat Kshetra. Please initiate the Tirtha." ||101-102|| The Lord knew the path himself, so the words of the Laukantika Devas, though repeating what was already known, were still fruitful in this context. ||103|| The Lord, compassionate towards the deer, quickly released them and entered the city with the princes. Upon reaching the city, they adorned the royal throne, and Indra, as before, came and praised him. ||104|| Then, Indra seated him on the bathing platform and showered him with milk brought by the Devas. They adorned him with garlands, unguents, clothes, and ornaments befitting the Devas. ||105|| The Lord, seated on the magnificent throne, was surrounded by the Asuras and the Devas, who were like the great mountain ranges surrounding Mount Meru. ||106||

## Chapter 55, Verse 107-112

**629**

**Verse 107:**  The fifty-five chapters of the **Sarg** (cycle) are dedicated to the **Jina** (liberated soul) who is eager for **tapas** (austerity). The **Haripura** (Krishna) and **Sarabhoja** (Yadu) lineages, though powerful like a lion, could not restrain him with their pleas.

**Verse 108:** The **Jina**, a master of the **sthitic** (state of being), explained the situation to his father and family. He then walked towards the **uttarakuru** (northern region) palanquin, crafted by the **Kubera** (wealth god) like a sculptor.

**Verse 109:** The palanquin was adorned with flags and white umbrellas, and had walls of precious gems. It was decorated with beautiful ornaments and carried various forms. Just as the moon ascends the mountain, the **Jina** ascended the palanquin.

**Verse 110:** The kings of the earth first lifted the auspicious palanquin. Then, led by Indra, the celestial beings carried it joyfully through the sky.

**Verse 111:** The sound of the celestial beings filled the sky, a sound that was not beneficial to those without **shri** (auspiciousness). The cries of the grieving **Bhoja** lineage reached the ears of all beings, echoing through the world.

**Verse 112:** The celestial beings bowed to **Neminaath** (a **Jina**), who appeared like a peaceful lake. The **Apsaras** (celestial dancers) danced with various expressions, like peacocks and cranes near a lake.

Harivamsha Purana
"The Jina, accompanied by the beautiful Amarasen, reached the Girnar mountain, which is as radiant as Mount Meru.  He who conquers the army of sins, is like the moon, radiant with beauty. ||113||
On this mountain, where the sun and moon, the destroyers of darkness, do not appear at the end of night and day, what is the point of describing its height? ||114||
This mountain, devoid of ugly flowers, is adorned with birds that fly in the streams of light, mango trees laden with fruits that offer sweet juice, and various kinds of trees full of flowers. ||115||
In that immaculate grove of the Girnar mountain, which appears like Mount Meru due to its jewels and gold, which is marked by the collection of various metals, which attracts Kinnara gods with its peaks, and which captivates the minds of humans and gods with its forest earth, a solitary lion, devoid of monkeys, roamed.  There, Indra, along with Vishnu-Krishna, offered their respects to the Jina, the conqueror of passions. ||116||
In the grove, the Jina, the lord of the universe, was honored by the gods, and the lion, along with Vishnu, offered their respects to him. ||117||
"

The fifty-fifth chapter: Here, the Lord, with the intention of performing a great penance, abandoned the palanquin-like seat, which was present on the earth, and which was pleasing to the gods, and went to the stone floor, like Naminath Bhagwan, to abandon the illusion of the earth. ||118|| Then, the extremely intelligent Lord Neminath, whose lotus-seat and patience were very radiant, and who was devoted to the thought of renouncing his beloved wife and the wealth of the kingdom, removed the garland, clothes, and all ornaments from within the curtain, and became free from possessions and full of compassion. With his soft-fingered, strong five fists, he immediately plucked out the thick, black hair, which was very beautiful and which only very timid people keep on their bodies for a long time. ||119-120|| The penance that Lord Neminath had undertaken was also undertaken by a thousand kings along with him. At that time, the sun's heat did not scorch the honorless Lord, because it was stopped by the umbrella placed by Indra, or the water of the umbrella was falling there. Due to its effect, the heat of the sun was not able to make them unhappy. ||121|| At that time, the group of kings, who were free from anger and possessed self-control, were becoming beautiful by plucking out the crooked hair tied on their heads by their own selves. It was as if they were removing the long-standing tradition of crooked thorns. ||122||

Indra, having gathered the hairs of the Lord, placed them in a casket adorned with the rays of a cluster of jewels, and cast them into the ocean of milk. At that time, the Lord was adorned with a body of extraordinary brilliance. || 123 || The place where Lord Neminatha, the protector of living beings, renounced his extremely pure garment-like possessions, quickly became a renowned pilgrimage site in the world, as described in the scriptures. || 124 || At that time, adorned with four kinds of knowledge, the Lord, the liberator of those who are free from possessions, was shining like the moon amidst countless sages, gods, and great poets, and among the planets and stars. || 125 || On the fourth day of the bright fortnight of the month of Shraavana, the Lord, the master of the vow, took initiation with a fast of two days. Therefore, on that day, humans, gods, and demons, who were givers of excellent things, celebrated the initiation ceremony with great enthusiasm. || 126 || Then, the gods and demons praised the Lord in this way: "O Lord, you are capable of defeating Kamadeva, you are the refuge of worldly beings who are engaged in beneficial activities, you are free from anger, you are free from greed, you are established in the highest Dharma, you are the protector of Dharma, and you are a sage, a meditator. Therefore, we bow to you." Thus, praising and bowing from all sides, the kings, who had Lord Neminatha, the ascetic, dwelling in their hearts, and who were like the revolving wheel of Nemi, the holder of the wheel, departed to their respective places. || 127-128 ||

## Chapter Fifty-Five

In the city of Dwarakapuri, the glorious, sinless (Avrjina) Lord, having come to take food, was offered a meal of excellent kheer by the great and glorious Pravardatta, who was blessed with great merit and was praised by the assembly of gods. (129)

On the path of penance, the princess Rajimati, filled with immense separation, endured the pain like the moon in separation from the sun, her mind filled with the thought of her father, who was engaged in penance for the welfare of the people. (130)

Overwhelmed by intense grief, Rajimati wept continuously, her ornaments and hair loose, surrounded by her attendants, her sorrowful cries echoing through the vast expanse of the sky and earth. (131)

With her beautiful hips and full breasts, adorned with a necklace of tears, she sometimes blamed her fate for taking away her beloved, and sometimes blamed her handsome husband. (132)

Her grief subsided by the words of her wise teachers, who encouraged her to embrace penance. She then resolved to engage in penance, which brings peace and happiness and removes misfortune. (133)

(In the Shalini meter)

Rajimati, whose beauty is like a lotus, adorned with the splendor of her hands and feet, has embraced a path that brings an end to suffering. Knowing this, her family members have found solace from their mental anguish. (134)

Page #672:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, it is said that women experience various kinds of suffering (vidukh). Firstly, they are subject to dependence (paratantraya), which is a specific kind of suffering. Then, when their husbands are difficult to obtain, they consider their bodies as empty and useless (vidukh). They also suffer from having co-wives (sapatni), being menstruating (pushpavasva), being barren (vandhya), being widowed (vaidhavya), experiencing illness during childbirth (sutir-roga), being blind (andha), being unfortunate (daurbhagya), having an unfortunate husband (bhagya-hina), having only daughters (stri-garbhatva), having repeated miscarriages (marta-patye), being completely orphaned (anatha), conceiving (garma-nava), being separated from their husbands while they are still alive (jivana-viyoga), or suffering from a fatal disease (marma-roga). 

Just as the threads (tantu) that are horizontal and vertical are the independent causes of a cloth, so too is false perception (mithyatva) the independent cause of being a woman. Therefore, those who are worthy of being served (sevya-sattva) should serve the right perception (samyag-darshan), which ends the suffering related to women.

Thus ends the fifty-fifth chapter (sarga) of the Harivamsha Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which includes the collection of the Arishtanemi Purana, and describes the auspicious initiation (diksha-kalyana) of the Lord.

## Chapter Fifty-Six

And the Muni-indra, Neminath, adorned with the three jewels and the glory of penance, shone brightly, having attained excellence through vows, secrecy, and assemblies, and bearing the burden of the world. ||1||

The Lord, possessing brilliant intellect, abandoned the inauspicious meditations of Atam and Raudra, and became eager to meditate on the auspicious meditations of Dharma and Shukla. ||2||

Meditation is the cessation of thought for a moment, focused on a single object, for a man of excellent concentration, and thought is the restless mind. ||3||

Pain is called Arati. The meditation that occurs during Arati is called Atam-dhyana. This Atam-dhyana arises from the power of extremely dark, blue, and dove-colored Leshya. ||4||

Atam-dhyana is of two types, external and internal. Among them, crying, etc., and being amazed at the prosperity of others, and being attached to objects, etc., are external Atam-dhyana. ||5||

One's own Atam-dhyana is known through self-awareness, and that of others through inference. Internal Atam-dhyana has four divisions, which are described below, along with their respective characteristics. ||6||

To contemplate that the desired object should not arise is the first Atam-dhyana. If an undesirable object has already arisen, to contemplate its separation repeatedly is the second Atam-dhyana. To contemplate that the desired object should never be separated is the third Atam-dhyana, and if the desired object has been separated, to contemplate its end is the fourth Atam-dhyana. ||7-8||

The external causes of undesirable suffering are of two types, based on the distinction between sentient and insentient. Among them, humans, etc., are sentient causes, and poison, weapons, etc., are insentient causes. ||9||

Internal causes are also of two types, based on the distinction between physical and mental. Various unbearable ailments like abdominal pain, eye pain, toothache, etc., arising from the aggravation of wind, etc., are physical causes. ||10||

And sorrow, aversion, fear, anxiety, dejection, etc., contaminated by poison, which are the causes of disgust and restlessness, etc., are mental causes of suffering. ||11||

To contemplate repeatedly, "May the arising of all kinds of undesirable objects not occur," is the first... ||12||

Page #674:
---------------------------
## Chapter 636:

**13.** How can the absence of this undesirable object be achieved? This continuous contemplation is called the second type of *ārt-dhyāna*.

**14.** The external means of achieving desirable happiness are of two types, based on the distinction between sentient and insentient beings. Sentient beings include animals, women, children, etc., while insentient beings include wealth, grains, etc.

**15.** Internal means are also of two types, based on the distinction between physical and mental. The state of health achieved through the balance of bile, etc., is the physical means, while the mental means are the happiness, etc., arising from love, freedom from sorrow, fearlessness, etc.

**16.** To contemplate that I should not be separated from this desirable object, both in this world and the next, is called the third *ārt-dhyāna*.

**17.** To contemplate the absence of the separation from the previously arisen desirable object, to contemplate it repeatedly, is called the fourth *ārt-dhyāna*.

**18.** The basis of this *ārt-dhyāna* is negligence, and its result is the path of the lower beings. This is a subtle, mixed, and destructive emotion, found from the first to the sixth *guṇa-sthāna*.

**19.** A being with a cruel intention is called *Rudra*. The contemplation of such a being is called *raudr-dhyāna*. This is of four types: *hiṃsā-ānanda*, *caurya-ānanda*, *mṛṣā-ānanda*, and *parigraha-ānanda*.

**20.** Those who find joy, i.e., delight, in violence, etc., are called, in short, *hiṃsā-ānanda*, etc.

**21.** *Raud-dhyāna* is of two types, based on the distinction between external and internal. External *raudr-dhyāna* is to behave cruelly and to speak abusive words, etc. Internal *raudr-dhyāna* is known through self-awareness, it is experienced by oneself, while external *raudr-dhyāna* is known through inference. The tendency towards violence, etc., in the form of initiation, commencement, and beginning, is internal *ārt-dhyāna*. This has four types: *hiṃsā-ānanda*, etc., whose characteristics are as follows:

**22.** To consider violence, etc., as three kinds of joy is the first *raudr-dhyāna* called *hiṃsā-ānanda*.

**23.** To contemplate deceiving others with one's own fabricated arguments regarding objects worthy of faith is the second *raudr-dhyāna* called *mṛṣā-ānanda*.

**24.** To intend to forcibly take another's wealth out of negligence is called the third *raudr-dhyāna* called *steya-ānanda*.

**25.** To constantly intend to protect both sentient and insentient possessions, and to consider oneself as the owner of these possessions, is the fourth *raudr-dhyāna* called *parigraha-ānanda*.

Page #675:
---------------------------
## Chapter Fifty-Six

**Verse 26:** The Raudra Dhyana is intense, with a tinge of black, blue, and dove-grey, associated with carelessness and occurring in the lower five Guna-sthana.

**Verse 27:** Its duration is an Antarmuhurta, as it is difficult to maintain its stability for longer. It arises from indirect knowledge, hence its nature is the cessation of decay and pacification.

**Verse 28:** It is dependent on the intensity of emotions and passions, therefore it is also characterized by generosity. The ultimate consequence of this Dhyana is the path to hell.

**Verse 29:** Those who aspire for liberation should abandon the two evil Dhyanas, Artharudra and Raudra, and become monks who accept pure alms, engaging their minds in Dharma Dhyana and Shukla Dhyana.

**Verse 30-31:** When a monk finds himself in a secluded, peaceful place free from the disturbances of small creatures, with the three types of divine substances (divine, cohesive, and material), a time free from hindrances like heat, and a pure intention, then he, who is capable of enduring all obstacles, begins the practice of proper Dhyana.

**Verse 32:** The practitioner of Dhyana is solemn, with a still body and a comfortable posture. His eyes are neither wide open nor completely closed.

**Verse 33:** He is free from all bodily activities, a master of the scriptures, and his breath flows gently.

**Verse 34:** The aspirant for liberation, focusing his mind on the navel, the crown of the head, the heart, or the forehead, contemplates the two beneficial Dhyanas, Dharma Dhyana and Shukla Dhyana.

**Verse 35:** The true nature of external and internal emotions is called Dharma. The Dhyana that is in harmony with this Dharma is called Dharma Dhyana.

**Verse 36:** Dharma Dhyana has two characteristics, based on the distinction between external and internal: seeking the meaning of the scriptures, practicing virtuous conduct, and being devoted to the collection of virtues.

**Verse 37:** The external characteristic of Dharma Dhyana is: yawning, stretching, sneezing, belching, slow breathing, a still body, and a mind engaged in virtuous conduct. The internal characteristic is tenfold, based on the distinction of: 1. Apāya Vicaya, 2. Upāya Vicaya, 3. Jīva Vicaya, 4. Ajīva Vicaya, 5. Vipāka Vicaya, 6. Vairāgya Vicaya, 7. Bhava Vicaya, 8. Saṁsthāna Vicaya, 9. Āśā Vicaya, and 10. Hetu Vicaya.

**Verse 25:** This Raudra Dhyana is the fourth type of Raudra Dhyana, which is characterized by the four types of contemplation: "I am the owner of this, and this is my self," repeated over and over again. This is called Pari Graha Samrakshana Ananda.

## Translation:

**638**

In the Harivamsha Purana, the tenfold Dharma-Dhyana (meditation on Dharma) are described as follows: Apaya-vicaya (meditation on the elimination of negative karma), etc. Apaya means renunciation, and Vicaya means contemplation. ||38||

The causes of Samsara (cycle of birth and death) are primarily the activities of the three Yogas (mind, speech, and body). How can I renounce these activities? This is the question. ||39||

The contemplation of the mind, speech, and body, which is influenced by auspicious influences, is considered the first Dharma-Dhyana, called Apaya-Vicaya. ||40||

The contemplation of how to bring the activities of the three Yogas under control through virtuous actions is considered the second Dharma-Dhyana, called Upaya-Vicaya. ||41||

According to the Dravya-naya (theory of substance), Jivas (souls) are eternal and without beginning or end. According to the Paryaya-naya (theory of change), they are finite and have a beginning and end. They are countless in number and have their own unique characteristics. They are equipped with a body, which is an inanimate instrument, and they experience the fruits of their own actions. This contemplation of the Jiva is considered the third Dharma-Dhyana, called Jiva-Vicaya. ||42-43||

The contemplation of the nature of the non-living substances, such as Dharma, Adharma, etc., is considered the fourth Dharma-Dhyana, called Ajeeva-Vicaya. ||44||

The contemplation of the fruits of the four types of bondage (Prakriti, Pradesh, Sthiti, and Anubhag) of the eight types of Karma (Karmas that bind the soul), is considered the fifth Dharma-Dhyana, called Vipaka-Vicaya. ||45||

The body is impure, and the objects of enjoyment are like the fruits of Karma. Therefore, it is beneficial to develop detachment from them. This contemplation is considered the sixth Dharma-Dhyana, called Viraga-Vicaya. ||46||

The state of existence after death, called Bhava, is characterized by suffering. This contemplation is considered the seventh Dharma-Dhyana, called Bhava-Vicaya. ||47||

The Lokakasha (space of the universe) and Alokakasha (space beyond the universe) are surrounded by three layers of wind. This contemplation of the structure of the universe is considered the eighth Dharma-Dhyana, called Sansthana-Vicaya. ||48||

The contemplation of the knowledge of the Jina (liberated soul) regarding the subtle realities like bondage, liberation, etc., which are beyond the senses, is considered the ninth Dharma-Dhyana, called Aajna-Vicaya. ||49||

A person who follows logic and relies on the Syadvada (theory of conditional predication) adopts the right path. This contemplation is considered the tenth Dharma-Dhyana, called Hetu-Vicaya. ||50||

## Chapter Fifty-Six

**52.** The tenfold Dharma-Dhyana, situated in the alternative of time and feeling, is to be contemplated by those devoted to Dhyana, as it yields the fruits of heaven and liberation.

**53.** That which is connected with purity is called white Dhyana. The absence of faults, etc., is purity. This is of two kinds, white and supremely white, and both white and supremely white are considered to have two subdivisions each.

**54.** The two subdivisions of white Dhyana are separate contemplation and contemplation of oneness, while the two subdivisions of supremely white Dhyana are subtle action, contemplation, and cessation of action, contemplation.

**55.** The characteristic of white Dhyana is of two kinds, external and internal. The external characteristic is the cessation of yawning, stretching, etc., in a person whose breathing is either imperceptible or ceased.

**56.** That which is self-perceived and inferred by others is the internal characteristic. The internal characteristic of both white and supremely white Dhyana is explained further.

**57.** Separateness or diversity is called distinctness. The faultless twelve-limbed knowledge of scripture is called contemplation.

**58.** The gradual transition of meaning, expression, and yoga is called contemplation. The object of contemplation is the meaning, the word that expresses it is the expression, and the yoga is the characteristic of speech, etc.

**59.** The contemplation of distinctness is the first white Dhyana, in which there is a gradual transformation of contemplation in meaning, etc.

**60.** Just as a sage, with a mind free from distraction, contemplates a single atom of substance or feeling, so too, a person, with a mind free from distraction, contemplates a single atom of substance or feeling.

**63.** Just as a very sharp weapon gradually cuts a tree, so too, a person, by gradually reducing the velocity of purity, brings about the cessation or destruction of the karmas that cause delusion.

**Explanation:** Here, the excellence of Dharma-Dhyana is described in the seventh, non-negligent, stage of the qualities, but generally, it occurs from the fourth to the seventh stage of the qualities and is the direct cause of heaven and the indirect cause of liberation.

**51-52.**

640
The Muni, by virtue of excessive destruction of karma, passes from one substance to another, from one state to another, from one sound to another, and from one yoga to another. ||60-62||

He attains the first white meditation, strengthened by the power of a more luminous shade. It is in both the Upasama and Kshapaka Gunasthanas, and is accompanied by the Kshayopaśamika state. This meditation, for the Muni who knows all the previous knowledge, lasts until the last moment of life. It is bestowed by the power of both the Gunasthanas and grants the fruits of heaven and liberation. ||63-64||

The second white meditation, called Ekatva Vitarka Vichar, is one in which there is only one form of Vitarka, devoid of any transition to other objects of Vitarka. ||65||

This meditation is directed towards a single atom or state. It destroys the karmas of delusion and other destroyers. It is for the previous holder and, through its influence, the meditating Muni becomes adorned with the Kshayika states of knowledge, perception, right faith, energy, and conduct. He now becomes a Tirthankara or a common Kevali. He is worshipped and served by all and becomes the supreme lord of the three worlds. He wanders for countless koti years in the past. ||66-68||

When the lifespan of these Kevali Bhagavans is reduced to the last moment and the three non-destructive karmas of Vedaniya, etc., remain in equal proportion to the lifespan, then they are capable of attaining the meditation called Sukhma Kriya Pratipati, which is the third in relation to the general white and the first in relation to the special, supreme white. They abandon all verbal yoga, mental yoga, and gross bodily yoga, and naturally attain the subtle bodily yoga. ||69-71||

When the lifespan of these Kevali Bhagavans is reduced to the last moment and the remaining three non-destructive karmas are more than the lifespan, then they naturally, by themselves, expand their self-regions through four times, performing Danda, Kapata, Pratara, and Lokapurana, and then contract them in the same four times, making the state of all karmas equal. This action is...

Page #679:
---------------------------
## Chapter Sixty-Four:

**641**

The power of the soul, in the destruction of the remaining karmas, in the digestion of the karmas, in the punishment, in the gate, and in the filling of the world, is the same. ||7||

Having performed the four times, and having gone out of its own region, it gathers itself together in the same state as the karma that has been done. ||75||

Having become the measure of the former body, it completes this. First, it is the white meditation, and then the second, the supreme. ||7||

The yoga of the pulsation of the region of the soul, and the karma of the vital force, etc., are said to be cut off, and this is called the cut-off action. ||77||

The restraint of all the arrows of bondage is there, with effort. The conduct of the non-yoga, as it is said, is the means of liberation. ||78||

The non-yoga-kevali soul, having destroyed all karma, shines with the power of consciousness, which has arisen like gold from the womb. ||79||

It becomes a Siddha, by its own nature, going upwards, because of the cause of the former practice, non-attachment, and the cutting off of bondage. ||80||

Like the flame of fire, like the wheel of the potter, like the water that has lost its sediment, like the castor seed, it goes upwards, in one moment, to the end of the upper world. ||81||

Because of the absence of the body of the Dharma-astika, the Siddha soul does not go beyond the end of the world. It remains in that place, enjoying infinite happiness. ||82||

Liberation is the greatest benefit for beings in the four classes. It is said to be obtained by the right meditation, which is characterized by the destruction of one's own karma. ||83||

The absence of the nature of karma is liberation, which brings infinite happiness. It is of two kinds for the embodied soul, because it is attainable by effort and without effort. ||84||

The absence of the other lives, except the life of the last body, is the absence without effort, because their existence does not come from before, and there is no new bondage for the last body. Now, it is said how the absence of the nature of the karmas, which is attainable by effort, takes place. ||85||

It is said that from the place of the qualities, the un-restrained right faith, beginning with the first place of the qualities, and ending with the seventh place of the qualities, the un-restrained right faith, a human being may be in any one of these places. ||86||

In the Harivamsha Purana, a person with pure intellect, having destroyed the seven natures of delusion, attains the pure, sun-like, impermanent right faith (Samyak Darshan). || 87 ||  He then, without being negligent, ascends the series of destroyers (Kshapaka) and performs the "Atha-pravritta-karana" (the action of downward movement) and then the "Apuurva-karana" (the action of non-occurrence). || 88 ||  Becoming "Apuurva-karana", he diminishes the state and the parts of the sinful natures, and attains the "Anivritti-karana" (the action of non-return). || 89 ||  In the ninth "Gunasthan" (stage of virtue) called "Anivritti", he receives the designation of "Kshapaka" and destroys the forest of karma-natures with the fire of "Shukla-dhyana" (white meditation). || 90 ||  He then destroys the sixteen natures, namely, "Nidra-nidra" (sleep-sleep), "Prachala-prachala" (restlessness-restlessness), "Styana-giddhi" (stupor-dizziness), "Naraka-gati" (hell-path), "Naraka-gati-anupurvi" (hell-path-consecutive), "Tiyach-gati" (animal-path), "Tiyach-gati-anupurvi" (animal-path-consecutive), the four types of births (Eka-indriya, etc.), "Sthavara" (stationary), "Atapa" (hot), "Udyota" (shining), "Sukshma" (subtle), and "Sadharana" (ordinary). || 91-92 ||  In this same "Gunasthan", after the destruction of the sixteen natures, he destroys the eight "Kshayas" (passions) called "A-pratyakhyana-avaran" (non-rejection covering) and "Pratyakhyana-avaran" (rejection covering). Then, he destroys the "Napumsaka-veda" (neuter-knowledge) and the "Stri-veda" (female-knowledge), and throws the six "Nokra-payas" (inferior knowledge) into the "Pum-veda" (male-knowledge) and destroys them all together. Then, he burns the "Pum-veda" in the fire of "Krodha" (anger), the "Krodha" in the fire of "Mana" (pride), the "Mana" in the fire of "Maya" (illusion), and the "Maya" in the fire of "Lobha" (greed), destroying them in sequence. || 93-95 ||  Then, he makes the "Lobha" even more subtle and reaches the tenth "Gunasthan" called "Sukshma-samparaya". At the end, he destroys the "Lobha" completely and eliminates the "Moha-karma" (delusion-karma) entirely. || 96 ||  Then, becoming a resident of the "Kshina-kshaya" (diminished-passion) "Gunasthan", he burns "Nidra" (sleep) and "Prachala" (restlessness) in the final stage, and "Jnana-avaran" (knowledge-covering) and "Antaraya" (obstacles) in the ultimate stage, and the four "Darsana-avaran" (perception-covering) with the fire of "Ekatva-vitarka" (single-thought) "Shukla-dhyana" (white meditation), and becomes a "Sayoga-kevali" (liberated with the body). || 97-98 ||  Then, transcending the "Sayoga-kevali" "Gunasthan", when he attains the next "Gunasthan", he becomes an "A-yoga-kevali" (liberated without the body) and in the final stage of the "Ahant" (ego) state, he chooses one of the two "Sata-vedaniya" (perceivable) and "A-sata-vedaniya" (imperceivable) "Dev-gati" (heavenly path), and takes the five bodies starting with the "Audarika-sharira" (subtle body), the five "Sanghata" (aggregates), the five "Bandha" (bondages), 
1. A-trai-va-anta-para-ma. 2. Pum-veda-ka. 3. Vitarka-agni-ma.

Sixty-five **Sargas** are divided into eight **Sparsh** and two **Gandha**. Then, there are **Devagati** in order of their occurrence, **Aguru**, **Lagghu**, **Uchchvas**, **Paradhat**, **Upadhat**, **Prashastha** and **Aprashastha** types of **Vihayogati**, **Pratyekakaya**, **Aparyapta**, **Sthira**, **Asthira**, **Shubha**, **Ashubha**, **Durbhaga**, **Susvara**, **Dusvara**, **Anadeya**, **Ayashakoti**, **Nirmana** and **Nichagotra**. These seventy-two **Prakritis** are destroyed by the **Ayogakevali** at the end of his life. 

Then, at the end of his life, the **Ayogakevali** destroys one of the two **Vedaniya**, **Asatavedaniya**, **Manushyaayu**, **Manushya** **Gati**, **Manushya** **Gati** **Prayogyanupurvi**, **Panchendriya** **Jati**, **Tras**, **Badar**, **Paryapta**, **Subhaga**, **Adeya**, **Uchchagotra**, **Yashakoti** and **Tirthankara**. These thirteen **Prakritis** are destroyed by the **Ayogakevali** at the end of his life. 

The **Ayogakevali** remains naturally stable due to the absence of **Pradesha** **Parispanda** in the **Gunasthan**. 

The **Ayogakevali** attains **Siddhi** after staying in the fourteenth **Gunasthan** for the amount of time it takes to pronounce the five short vowels **A**, **I**, **U**, **R**, **Lu**. This **Siddhi** is **Sadi** and **Ananta** and is filled with infinite qualities. 

Lord **Nemnath** meditates on the ten types of **Dharmya** **Dhyana** as mentioned earlier, and for sixty-five days and nights, he performs **Tapasya**.

In the Harivamsha Purana, on the first day of the bright fortnight of Ashwin, the Lord, having consumed the four-gated Mahavana with the fire of pure meditation, attained the fourfold infinity of omniscience, omniscience, and other such things, which is very rare even for the rulers of the three worlds, causing their thrones to tremble. ||112||
The Jains, recognizing the attainment of liberation by the Lord, rejoiced with the sound of bells, the roar of lions, the clear sound of drums, and the loud sound of conch shells. The Indras, using their knowledge of the future, recognized this event by the trembling of their thrones and their high crowns. With their armies, which could shake the oceans, they went to the three worlds. ||114||
With countless armies of seven types, the lords of the gods, with their vehicles moving with irresistible speed, filled the sky, which is like an ocean, and went around Mount Girnar three times. At that time, the mountain was conquering even Mount Sumeru, the king of mountains, which was proud of its high peak, because on Mount Sumeru, only the birth-auspicious ceremony of the Lord had taken place, while on Mount Girnar, after the initiation-auspicious ceremony, the knowledge-auspicious ceremony had also taken place, revealing many virtues. ||115||
The gods showered flowers from trees like Mandara, which filled the directions with fragrance. The sound of drums mixed with the beautiful music of the celestial maidens filled the world. The Ashoka tree, bearing fruits and flowers, appeared, destroying the sorrow of the people. Three white umbrellas, symbols of the Lord's sovereignty over the three worlds, circled above his head. Thousands of white fly whisks, beautiful like the flight of swans and whitening the ground of the mountain, fell down. A radiant halo appeared, defeating the group of rays of the sun, which was shining with its own brilliance. The rays of the group of various jewels... ||116||

The sixty-fifth **sarga** (chapter) of the **Harivamsa** (lineage of the heroes), composed by **Jinaseenaacharya**, describing the **kevalgyan** (omniscience) of **Bhagavan** (Lord) **Neminaath**, is complete.

A golden lion throne, born from the **Indradhanush** (rainbow), appeared, and a divine sound, filled with the distinctions of various languages, but devoid of the movement of lips, began to resound. Thus, adorned with the aforementioned eight **praatihaarya** (miracles), all his unique qualities that pacified others, and thirty-four **atishaya** (supernatural powers) related to **karma** (action), birth, and divine creation, the twenty-second **Tirthankara** (ford-maker) **Neminaath**, the embodiment of natural courage, and a radiant sun of a multitude of virtues, manifested on earth for the salvation of the three worlds.

Thus ends the sixty-fifth **sarga** of the **Harivamsa**, which is a collection of the **Arishta-Nemipuraana** (the Purana of Arishta-Neminaath), describing the attainment of **kevalgyan** by **Bhagavan** (Lord) **Neminaath**.

The seventy-seventh Sarga: The Samvadi Samapadi Sharan, a refuge for all beings in the three worlds, was created by the Dev in an instant. ||1||
All the inhabitants of Dwaravati, the ocean of the Yadu and Bhoj clans, led by Baldev and Krishna, ascended Mount Girnar with great splendor. Seeing the Samvadi Sharan of the Jina, the vast ocean of people was filled with wonder. ||2-3||
The nature of the Samvadi Sharan land, the land of the Tirthankaras, is described here briefly for the listeners. ||4||
The Samvadi Sharan is one hand higher than the natural land, and one hand above that is the Kalpa land. ||5||
This land, victorious over the Lakshmi of heaven, is square, pleasant, and extends from twelve yojanas to one yojana, depending on the time and place. ||6||
This land is shaped like a lotus, with the Gandhakuti rising like a grain, and the outer land spreading like lotus petals. ||7||
This land is made of Indra-neelamani, its outer surface is as clear as a mirror, and it provides space for many beings to enter. ||8||
The land called Manaangan, where Indra and other gods, worthy of respect, worship the Lord of the Three Worlds from afar. ||9||
This land has four Maha-Vithis, two kosas wide, in each of the four cardinal directions. These Vithis support four Manastambhas in their center. ||10||
These pillars are three times wider than their height, and are adorned with golden and jeweled statues, which are worshipped by humans, gods, and demons. ||11||
The land called Aasthanangan, where humans and gods worship the Manastambhas, is adorned with the brilliance of glowing red gems. ||12||
In the middle of the Vithis are four golden platforms, three-angled, chest-high, and half a kosa wide. ||13||

## The City of the Jainas

**11.** Four human pillars adorn the platforms, each a bow less wide than the platform and a yojana higher.

**15.** They are visible from a distance of twelve yojanas, standing on lotus-shaped bases at the front of the palika. Their roots are made of diamond, their middles of crystal, and their tops of lapis lazuli.

**16.** Each pillar has two thousand corners, two thousand facets, and is adorned with rays of various gems. Above them, in all four directions, are images of the Siddhas, and they are surrounded by large, jeweled palikas.

**18.** These pillars, with their radiance, illuminate a region of twenty yojanas, like the jewel in Lakshmi's crown. They are designed to stop those whose minds are filled with ego, both gods and humans.

**19.** Around these pillars are four ponds, filled with lotuses and echoing with the sounds of swans, cranes, and geese.

**20.** Beyond the ponds is a vajra-made wall, chest-high, shining brightly, twice as wide as it is high, and surrounding the entire city.

**21.** Surrounding the wall is a moat, its earth made of gems that shine like water. The water in the moat is knee-deep, and it resembles a blue sari worn by the earth, a woman.

**22.** The moat is very clean, and its water is tinged yellow by the pollen of golden lotuses. The reflections of the directions, like women, appear in the water, with their faces adorned with angaraga.

**23.** Beyond the moat is a forest of vines, fragrant with fruits that perfume the ends of the directions. The forest is filled with birds and bees.

**24.** Beyond the forest is a wall, shining like gold, adorned with four large gateways, named Vijay and others.

**25.** At the gateways are the gods of the Vyantara caste, adorned with ornaments like kataka, and with their power they repel the unworthy.

Within, a theatre of great splendor, where the Lokapalas, adorned with brilliance, are constantly entertained by celestial dancers. **68**

Beyond, a platform, a seat of noble qualities, adorned with a network of radiant gems, dispelling the darkness with its brilliance. **69**

There stand the Siddhartha trees, adorned with the forms of the Siddhas, their branches reaching out to embrace the directions as if by desire. **70**

A temple, adorned with twelve stupas, like ornaments upon the earth, shines like the four golden Meru mountains that adorn the great Meru of Jambudvipa. **71**

Four auspicious gateways, adorned with vedikas, mark the four directions, and within each, four pools of water. **72**

They are known as Nanda, Bhadra, Jaya, and Purna, in order. Those who bathe in their waters remember their past lives. **73**

Filled with pure water, they cleanse all sins and diseases. Those who look upon them see their seven past and future lives. **74**

In the Harivamsha Purana,
The beginning of charity, virtue, austerity, and worship, and their fruits, as well as the calamities that result from their absence, inspire faith in these. ||82||
A flag adorned with a radiant sphere, a garland of pearls, and a sparkling gem, vibrates with the wind, making a delightful sound of bells. ||83||
The flag, adorned with a garland of radiant gems, appears like a wave rising from the ocean, as it flutters in the sky. Indra and other gods watch it with great curiosity. ||84||
In the midst of this, stands a golden throne, adorned with the Indra flag, which seems like the very embodiment of victory and prosperity. ||85||
Beyond this, stands a magnificent pavilion, supported by a thousand pillars, known as the "Mooर्तिमती," where the Shruta-Devatā resides. ||86||
To the right of this Shruta-Devatā, surrounded by many wise and virtuous sages, the Shruta-Kevali, the blessed one, expounds the Shruta. ||87||
There are four pavilions, half the size of the "Mooर्तिमती," where storytellers narrate tales of accusation and other such stories. ||88||
In scattered spaces around these pavilions, sages, possessing the great powers of Kevala-Jnāna and other such powers, clearly explain the highest truths to those who seek them. ||89||
Beyond this, there is a golden platform, adorned with various creepers, which is regularly worshipped with offerings. ||90||
The entrance to this platform is called "Shripada," adorned with a cluster of gems and flowers, and filled with radiant circles like the sun and moon, in the middle of the path. ||91||
On either side of this entrance, there are two pavilions called "Prabhasaka," where two gods, the lords of treasures, who grant desires, stand facing the path. ||92||
Beyond these, there are two vast theaters called "Preksha-Shala," where Apsaras, the celestial dancers, who dwell in the Kalpa, dance eternally. ||93||
At the corners of the Vijayangaṇa, there are four Lokastupas, adorned with rows of flags, extending for four yojanas. ||94||

Chapter Fifty-Seven

These Lokastupas are like a Vetrasana (a type of seat) below, like a Jhallari (a type of ornament) in the middle, like a Mridanga (a type of drum) above, and at the end, they have a long tube like a Talavriksha (a type of tree). ||95|| Their form is like pure crystal, therefore, the inner structure is very clear. In these stupas, the structure of the Lokas is clearly visible, like in a mirror. ||96|| In front of these stupas, there are stupas known as Madhyaloka, whose inner structure is clearly visible. ||97|| Further ahead, there are stupas named Mandara, which are radiant like the Mandarachala (a mythical mountain), and on them, the images of the Lord are adorned in all four directions. ||98|| In front of them, there are stupas called Kalpavasa, which are filled with the creations of the Kalpavasis (celestial beings), and they show the glory of the Kalpavasa Devas to those who see them. ||99|| In front of them, there are stupas called Graiveyaka, which are shaped like Graiveyakas (a type of celestial being), and they seem to show the beauty of the Graiveyakas to humans. ||100|| In front of them, there are nine stupas called Navanudisha, which are adorned, and in them, beings see the nine directions directly. ||101|| Further ahead, there are stupas called Sarvarthasiddhi, which are adorned with Vimanas (flying vehicles) like Vijay and others in all four directions, and they fulfill all desires. ||102|| In front of them, there are Siddhastupas, which are radiant like crystal, and in them, the reflection of mirrors is visible, which reveals the form of the Siddhas. ||103|| In front of them, there are stupas called Bhavya Kuta, which have radiant peaks, and they are not seen by the Abhavya beings, because their eyes are blinded by their influence. ||104|| In front of them, there are stupas called Pramodha, and when people see them, they become extremely confused and forget even the things they have been accustomed to for a long time. ||105|| Further ahead, there are other stupas called Prabodha, and when people see them, they attain enlightenment, and by attaining the truth, they become virtuous and are definitely liberated from the cycle of birth and death. ||106|| In this way, there are ten very tall stupas, whose platforms are connected to each other and are adorned with toranas (gateways), and they are adorned in order, up to the circumference. ||107|| Further ahead, there is a circumference that is one Krosa (a measure of distance) wide and one Dhanu (a measure of length) high, and within it, humans and gods roam. ||108||

In the Harivamsha Purana, there are seventeen **Kani**kas (circular divisions) placed outside, each extending one **Kosha** (unit of distance). In the center, there is one **Kani**ka, which is three and a half **Yojanas** (unit of distance) in extent. ||109|| Just as the **Parivesha** (halo) surrounds the sun, similarly, this **Paridhi** (perimeter) made of various precious gems surrounds the inner luminous **Mandala** (circle). ||110|| As soon as the **Bhartu** (Lord) desires, a divine city is created there. This is appropriate, because the influence of those beings who possess **Manas Paryaya** (knowledge of the mind) is great. ||111|| That city is known by the **Jnanis** (knowledgeable ones) as **Triloka Sara** (essence of the three worlds), **Shrikant** (beloved of Lakshmi), **Shriprabhu** (Lord of wealth), **Shivamandhir** (temple of Shiva), **Triloki Shri** (glory of the three worlds), **Lokakanti Shri** (glory of the world), **Shripur** (city of wealth), **Tridashpriya** (beloved of the gods), **Lokalokaprakasha** (illuminator of the worlds), **Dyaurudaya** (sunrise), **Abhyudayaavah** (bringer of progress), **Kshema** (welfare), **Kshemapur** (city of welfare), **Punya** (merit), **Punyaah** (merit-giver), **Pushpakaspada** (abode of the celestial chariot), **Bhuvah** (earth), **Svarbhu** (heaven), **Tapah** (austerity), **Gatyam** (path), **Lokalokothama** (best of the worlds), **Ruchi** (taste), **Ruchiavah** (bringer of taste), **Udadhi** (ocean), **Danadharmapur** (city of charity and righteousness), **Shreya** (welfare), **Shreyaskara** (welfare-giver), **Tirtha** (pilgrimage site), **Tirthavah** (bringer of pilgrimage), **Udgraha** (remover of obstacles), **Vishal** (vast), **Chitrakoot** (mountain of beautiful peaks), **Dhi Shri Dhar** (holder of wisdom and wealth), **Trivishtap** (three-storied), **Mangal** (auspicious), **Uttama** (best), **Kalyan** (welfare), **Sharan** (refuge), **Jay** (victory), **Aparajita** (invincible), **Aditya** (sun), **Jayanti** (victorious), **Achal** (immovable), **Sampur** (city), **Vijayant** (victorious), **Vimala** (pure), **Vimala Prabha** (radiant purity), **Kamabhu** (desire-fulfilling), **Gaganabhog** (enjoyer of the sky), **Kalyan** (welfare), **Kalinasan** (destroyer of evil), **Pavitra** (holy), **Pancha Kalyan** (five auspicious qualities), **Padmaavat** (abode of lotus), **Pramodaya** (joy), **Parayam** (supreme), **Mandita Vasi** (dweller in the adorned), **Mahendra** (Indra), **Mahimalaya** (mountain of glory), **Swayambhuv** (self-created), **Sudhadhatri** (giver of nectar), **Shuddhavasa** (pure abode), **Sukhavati** (land of happiness), **Viraja** (without impurities), **Vitashoka** (free from sorrow), **Arthavimala** (pure in meaning), **Vinayavani** (earth of humility), **Bhutadhatri** (earth-sustainer), **Purakalpa** (ancient city), **Puran** (ancient), **Punyasanchay** (accumulation of merit), **Rishivati** (abode of sages), **Yamavati** (abode of Yama), **Ratnavati** (abode of gems), **Ajaramara** (immortal), **Pratiṣṭhā** (establishment), **Brahmanishthovri** (abode of those devoted to Brahman), **Ketumalini** (abode of Ketu), **Arindam** (conqueror of enemies), **Manorama** (delightful), **Tamahpar** (beyond darkness), **Arsni** (gem), **Ratnasanchay** (accumulation of gems), **Ayodhya** (city of Rama), **Amritadhani** (abode of nectar), **Brahmapur** (city of Brahma), **Jataahvaya** (born with a name), and **Udattaarth** (noble meaning). ||112-122|| That city, born from the influence of the **Bhartu** (Lord), is adorned with the collection of all the best things from the three worlds, is wondrous, and generates great wonder. ||123|| Even the creator, Kubera, focusing his mind on its creation, is bewildered. If that is the case, then what to speak of others? ||124||

## Chapter Fifty-Seven

**655**

The city's construction is adorned with twenty-six types of gold and jewels, making it exceptionally beautiful. **125**

There are three *jagatis* (levels) at its base, each half a *krosa* (league) wide. The width decreases progressively with each higher *jagati*. **126**

These *jagatis* are constructed of diamond and adorned with various precious stones, their brilliance spreading like rainbows in all directions. **127**

The *jagatis* are adorned with pillars, each as tall as a man's chest, radiating a brilliant light. Between these pillars, beautiful flags are placed at the distance of a bow. **128**

Each *jagati* has thirty-foot-tall *kutas* (towers) and twice as wide *kosthakas* (compartments) placed at intervals of ten bows. **129**

Near each *jagati*, on both sides, are two dwellings for the gatekeepers, where the wealth of Kubera shines brightly at each gate. **130**

Each *jagati* has seven hundred and seventy-two *kutas* and forty-eight *kosthakas*. **131**

In total, the three *jagatis* have twenty-two hundred and twenty *kutas* and the same number of *kosthakas*. **132**

The first *jagati* has thirty-two thousand three hundred and eighty-one flags, the second has twenty-four thousand two hundred and nineteen, and the third has thirty-one thousand fifty-six. **133**

The *kutas* at the front have two hundred and thirty-two thousand four hundred and seventy flags, those in the middle have seven hundred and sixty-one thousand one hundred, and those at the back have two hundred and fifty-four thousand eight hundred and eighty. The number of *kosthakas* is double this. **134-135**

Thus, the total number of flags is twenty-six million twenty thousand two hundred and fifty-six. **136**

In the areas where sweat-inducing water flows, there are many pavilions adorned with jewels, two *krosas* wide and one *krosa* high. **137**

In the middle of the peaks, which are half the width of the pavilions, reside the Jina-devas, radiating auspicious light. **138**

Page #694:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, even though they are situated in their respective places, they appear to be present in the sky, having emerged from those places, for those who see them face to face, as instructed. ||139||

There are three shining seats in the four directions. In the first seat, there are four thousand Dharmachakras shining. ||140||

In the second seat, there are eight great flags, different from the flags of peacocks and swans, shining in the directions. ||141||

In front, there is a magnificent palace called Gandhakuli, adorned with auspicious objects, which illuminates the Srimandapa. In it resides the Lord's throne. ||142||

On that throne, the Jina Lord was seated. Crowds of men, gods, and demons, with their minds filled with joy, praised him with their hands placed on their crowns. ||143||

They said, "Victory to you, O Mahadeva! Victory to you, O Maheshvara! Victory to you, O Mahabaho! Victory to you, O Mahekshana!" ||144||

After countless such praises, Varadatta immediately took initiation and became the first Ganadhara, the lord of the ganas. ||145||

At that time, Rajimati, along with six thousand queens, also took initiation and became the head of the group of Ayikas. ||146||

All the groups of monks, starting with the group of monks, and the twelve ganas, paid their respects to Lord Nemnath in their respective places and worshipped him. ||147||

The twelve assemblies surrounded the path, with the group of monks in the east, south, and other directions. ||148||

There, in front of Varadatta, who bestows great boons, shone many monks, who were like pure embodiments of Dharma, like the very essence of the Dharmaeshvara. ||149||

In front of them, shone the Kalpavasini goddesses, who seemed to be the external and internal manifestations of the Lord, taking on their form. ||150||

After them, in the third assembly, sat the Aryikas, adorned with the wealth of qualities like shame, compassion, forgiveness, and peace, like the daughters of true Dharma. ||151||

## Chapter Fifty-Seven

**152.** The women of the celestial sphere, radiant with the light emanating from the Lord, were seated there, their brilliance surpassing even the stars.

**153.** Like the beautiful women of the forest, dwelling in the forest, who bow down to the feet of the Lord, so too, the women of the forest, adorned with flowers and creepers, were bowing down to the Lord.

**154.** The women of the mansions, filled with devotion to the Lord, were seated there, resembling the goddesses of heaven, earth, and the netherworld, who had come to the Lord's presence.

**155.** The celestial beings, their bodies glowing with the brilliance of ruby-like gems, were filled with fear of their own existence, and they were seeking refuge in the Lord, the destroyer of the bonds of sin.

**156.** The beautiful celestial beings, resembling the celestial beings of Mount Mandara, were adorned with garlands of flowers, and they were seated there, ready to serve the Lord.

**157.** The celestial beings, whose brilliance was eclipsed by the Lord's, like the sun and other celestial bodies, were bowing down to the Lord, seeking an increase in their own brilliance.

**158.** The celestial beings, embodiments of beauty and happiness, were standing there, like the parts of the Lord, radiating their brilliance, led by Indra, the king of the gods.

**159.** The kings, like the rulers of the earth, adorned with the mark of the wheel, were offering their homage to the Lord, like pure embodiments of charity, worship, and other virtues.

**160.** Others, like the animals, were present there, having been freed from the vices of ignorance, hatred, and delusion, and having attained the virtues of knowledge, forgiveness, and others. They appeared as if they were different from their former selves, having shed their natural crookedness and become transformed.

**161.** Thus, the twelve groups of celestial beings, resembling the twelve limbs of the Lord, were worshipping the Lord in a clockwise manner.

**162.** Lord Neminatha, with the brilliance of his throne, was proclaiming his supreme sovereignty, which was not found in others. The celestial beings, with their fans made of celestial feathers, were fanning the Lord, in a manner that was pleasing to him.

Harivaṃśapurāṇa
The three umbrellas, signifying the sovereignty over the three realms, the radiant Bhāmaṇḍala, dispelling the darkness of the cycle of births and deaths, the Aśoka tree adorned with flowers of all seasons, capable of removing the sorrow of all beings, the worship with a shower of flowers, the proclamation of fearlessness, the auspiciousness of victory, the joyful sound of musical instruments, delighting the hearts of the virtuous, all these were being manifested. ||163-165||
Those who are under the control of the soul are called Pratihāras. Thus, Lord Neminātha was adorned with the eight great Pratihāryas, born from the qualities of the soul. ||166||
Lord, the sovereign of all realms, possessing all the glories arising from the soul, was seated in the Samvasaraṇa, for the welfare of all beings. ||167||
At that time, the gods were proclaiming to the beings, "O, fortunate ones, who desire the welfare of the soul! The Kevali Lord, possessing the fully developed soul, is seated here. Come quickly, come quickly, and pay your respects to Him." ||168||
Thus, when the gods called out, humans, gods, and Asuras, all came to the Samvasaraṇa from all directions, with great splendor. ||169||
As soon as they came within sight of the Samvasaraṇa, they dismounted from their vehicles, folded their hands, touched their foreheads, and stood in the Mānaṅgaṇa. ||170||
Then, leaving behind their vehicles and other possessions, they circumambulated the Mānapīṭha, adorned with special royal insignia. ||171||
After circumambulating, they first paid their respects to the Mānastambha, and then, with the highest devotion in their hearts, the noble ones entered within. ||172||
And the sinners, those who perform evil deeds, the Śūdras, the hypocrites, the eunuchs, the disabled, the deformed, and those with deluded minds, continued to circumambulate outside. ||173||
The kings of the gods, the kings of the Asuras, and the human kings, along with other noble ones, left behind their umbrellas, fly whisks, and ornaments in the Jayāṅgaṇa.

The fifty-seventh chapter.

174. Entering with their families, they join their hands and enter. 
175. Wearing jeweled crowns, they enter, bow down according to the rules, ascend the chakra-pitha, and circumambulate the Tri-Ishvara three times.
176. They worship as they wish, with offerings of their own power and wealth, and bowing down, they mention their names.
177. Then, descending by their own stairs, with their hands joined to their foreheads, their joy evident in their trembling, they sit down in their respective places.
178. Just as a cluster of lotuses blooms in front of the sun, so too does the cluster of lotuses, in the form of the twelve assemblies, bloom in front of the sun, in the form of the Jina.
179. Just as a river cannot fill the ocean, so too, entering from all sides, that army cannot fill the Samavasarana.
180. There, going out, coming in, entering, seeing, circumambulating, being satisfied, bowing down to the Lord, and praising him, the group of the virtuous always remains.
181. There is no delusion, no attachment or aversion, no anxiety, desire, or envy, no yawning or stretching, no sleep, no drowsiness, no distress, no hunger, no thirst, and no other misfortune at all, always, all day long.
182. There is no other misfortune at all, always, all day long.
183. In the Samavasarana, the land of the equal, where the Muni-natha, pure in his inner self and limbs, resides, the group of the twelve assemblies, with their thirsty eyes, drink the nectar-like beauty of the Jain form, like a sea of water.

Thus ends the fifty-seventh chapter of the Harivamsa, composed by Jinasena Acharya, containing the description of the Samavasarana, from the collection of the Arishta-nemi Purana.

Page #698:
---------------------------
The eighth chapter of the Samavasarana, a place of eternal celebration and infinite blessings, was filled with devotees, hands clasped in reverence, eager to hear the Dharma.  Varadatta, the head of the Ganadharas, bowed to the supreme among the speakers, Lord Neminath, and asked a question for the benefit of all the worthy souls.  

"O Lord, what is the ultimate benefit for all beings?" he inquired. 

Following this question, the divine voice of the Lord resonated.  This divine sound emanated from the four faces of the Lord, signifying the four Purusharthas (goals of human life).  It was a meaningful sound, supporting the four varnas (social classes) and ashramas (stages of life), echoing in all directions.  It was the mother of the four Anuyogas (paths of spiritual practice), the one who exposes, challenges, awakens, and liberates.  

It had nine stages: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine.  It was a single entity, yet capable of generating infinite variations.  It destroyed the harmful, fostered the beneficial, established the good, and maintained it in its rightful place.  It swiftly removed the inauspicious and fulfilled the supreme auspiciousness.  It weakened and ultimately destroyed the accumulated karma.  

This divine sound, emanating from the Lord's presence, could be heard clearly within a radius of one yojana (approximately 9 miles).  It was as if the sound originated everywhere within that circle, with no difference in its clarity or sweetness.

Page #699:
---------------------------
Chapter Forty-Eight

The divine sound, sweet, smooth, deep, sublime, and with clear letters, was unique, one, and pure. ||9|| The state of the world, bound by the non-dual nature of existence and non-existence, was visible in it. It was without cause, eternal, and self-evident. ||10|| There is a soul, there is a hereafter, there are dharma and adharma, and the living being is the doer and enjoyer of them. The statement that all the objects of the world are impermanent and non-existent was also visible in that divine sound. ||11|| This living being itself performs actions, itself enjoys their fruits, itself wanders in the world, and itself is liberated from it. ||12|| Confused by ignorance and attachment, it wanders repeatedly in the ocean of existence, and becoming pure by knowledge and detachment, it attains perfect state. ||13|| It was like a lamp illuminating this special knowledge of the soul, and quickly dispelling the darkness of ignorance about form and other qualities. ||14|| Just as water falling from the sky is one, but appears in various forms when it falls on the earth, so too, that speech of the Lord, though one, was appearing in various forms in the assembly according to the qualities of the recipients. ||15|| That divine sound of the Lord, illuminating all things in the world, was defeating the sun, and was shattering the ignorance-darkness, along with its coverings, in the hearts of the attentive assembly. ||16|| The Lord was saying that the liberation of the path-traveler of the world, who is endowed with the purity of the state of being a worthy soul, has been seen. Meaning: Only a worthy soul attains liberation. ||17|| The means of that liberation is obtained from the single cause of meditation and study, and first of all, it is in the form of the three-fold combination of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct. ||18|| In them, having faith in the seven principles, including the soul, pure and free from all internal impurities like doubt, etc., is considered right faith. ||19|| That right faith arises from the destruction, subsidence, and destruction-subsidence of the darkness of the delusion of perception. It is of three kinds due to the difference of being perishable, etc., and two kinds due to the difference of being innate and acquired. ||20||

Page #700:
---------------------------
##  Translation:

**662**

There are two types. ||20||

Jiva, Ajiva, Asrava, Bandha, Samvara, Nirjara and Moksha are the seven Tattvas; one should have faith in them with their respective characteristics. ||21||

The characteristic of Jiva is its use, and that use is of eight types. The eight types of use are Mati, Shruta and Avadhi - these three, Samyakgyan and Mithyagyan - both forms. ||22||

Iccha, Dvesha, Prayatna, Sukha and Duhkha are all Chidatmika. These are the characteristics of Jiva, because it is through these that the Jiva, in its form of Chaitanya, is recognized. ||23||

The Jiva is not said to be merely the form of the Earth and other elements; because that is the state of its body. The body has Anekanta with Chaitanya, meaning the body remains the same, but the Chaitanya departs. ||24||

In flour, yeast (seed of liquor) and water, etc., the element of power that produces intoxication is separate, but in the parts of the body, the power of Chaitanya is not separate. Meaning - even when the causes of liquor, such as flour, etc., are separated, some element of intoxicating power remains in them. Similarly, when the parts of the body are separated, no element of Chaitanya power remains in them. This proves that Chaitanya is not the property of the parts of the body, but is a separate substance from them. ||25||

Those who believe in the origin or manifestation of Chaitanya from the four elements, Earth, etc., why don't they believe in the origin or manifestation of oil from sand, etc.? Meaning - just as oil cannot originate or manifest from sand, etc., similarly, Chaitanya cannot originate or manifest from the four elements, Earth, etc. ||26||

This Jiva is eternal in this world, it comes here from another state due to its own karma, and due to its karma, it goes to another state. ||27||

As much as it is visible to the naked eye, that much is the Jiva - therefore, its progeny does not continue in the future, etc., such statements are contradictory statements of those who harm themselves and others. ||28||

To say that the Atma is the Sanvid (knowledge) that arises moment by moment is also not correct, because if Sanvid is considered momentary, then the intellect that connects the past and future will be lost, and with its loss, the transactions of giving and taking, and the actions of the doer, etc., will be lost. ||29||

Therefore, it is proven that this Jiva is itself a substance, a knower, a seer, a doer, an enjoyer, a destroyer of karma, a producer-consumer, always endowed with qualities, with countless regions, with contraction and expansion. ||30||

## The Eighth Chapter:

The soul is not the size of a mustard seed, nor the size of an atom, nor the size of a finger joint, nor five hundred yojanas in size. [32]

If the soul is considered to be as small as a mustard seed, a finger joint, or an atom, then it would reside in each part of the body, not in the whole body. In such a situation, the sense of touch would not be able to function where the soul is not present. Just as the senses of sight, etc., function only in specific parts of the body, the sense of touch would also function only where the soul is present, not everywhere. [33]

Similarly, if the size of the soul is considered to be larger than the body, then it would extend to many yojanas beyond the body, where there is only the soul and no body. In such a situation, the sense of touch would be able to perceive objects at a distance of many yojanas, just as the sense of sight can perceive objects at a distance of many yojanas. This would contradict both direct perception and inference. Therefore, the soul should be considered to be the size of the body. This is also the experience of everyone. [34-35]

The soul is sought after through the fourteen **marganas** (paths): motion, senses, six bodies, yoga, knowledge, passions, knowledge, restraint, right faith, subtle bodies, vision, consciousness, auspiciousness, and nourishment. It is described through the fourteen **gunasthanas** (stages of qualities): false belief, etc. [36-37]

The **sanskari** (worldly) soul should be understood through **pramana** (proof), **naya** (principle), **nikshepa** (deposit), **sat** (being), **sankhya** (number), and **nirdesha** (indication), etc. The liberated soul should be understood through its infinite qualities of knowledge, etc. [38]

There are many aspects of a substance. The knowledge that grasps one specific aspect of a substance is called **naya**. There are two types of **naya**: **dravyaarthika** (substance-based) and **paryayaarthika** (category-based). Of these, **dravyaarthika naya** is true, and **paryayaarthika naya** is untrue. [39]

**Dravyaarthika** and **paryayaarthika** are the two fundamental **nayas**, and they are considered to be interdependent. **Naigama**, **sangraha**, etc., are different types of **nayas** that are derived from these two fundamental **nayas**. [40]

**Naigama**, **sangraha**, **vyavahara**, **rjusutr**, **shabda**, **samabhirudha**, and **evambhuta** are the types of **nayas**. [41]

Page #702:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana,
There are three types of Dravyarthic Nayas, which are general in scope. There are four other types of Paryayarthic Nayas, which are specific in scope. ||42||
The Nay that accepts only the concept of an object is called Naigam Nay. Examples of this are Prastha and Odan. ||43||
The Nay that accepts all objects by bringing together their various aspects and synonyms is called Sangrah Nay. For example, Sat or Dravy. ||44||
The Nay that differentiates objects is called Vyavahar Nay. It takes the objects of Sangrah Nay, such as Sat, Dravy, and Guna, and differentiates them further. ||45||
The Nay that accepts only the present aspect of an object, ignoring its past and future aspects, is called Rijusutra Nay. ||46||
The Nay that is based on the meaning of words, and considers factors like gender, means, number, case, tense, and modifiers, is called Shabd Nay. ||47||

## Chapter 665

**Verse 48:** The *Shabdabheda* (word-difference) *Arthabheda* (meaning-difference) *Arthī* (meaning-oriented) *Vyaktā* (explicit) *Paryāya* (synonym) *Shabdaka* (word) *Naya* (principle) is established equally. It means that the meaning is established equally even though the words are different.

**Explanation:**

* **Word-difference meaning-difference meaning-oriented explicit synonym word principle:** This principle accepts that different words can have different meanings even if they refer to the same object.
* **Established equally:** This means that the principle is applied consistently, regardless of the specific words used.
* **Meaning is established equally:** This means that the meaning of the object is understood even though different words are used to describe it.
* **Words are different:** This refers to the use of synonyms or different words to describe the same object.

**Example:**

The word "Indra" can refer to the king of the gods, but it can also refer to a specific deity with specific powers and attributes. The *Shabdabheda* *Arthabheda* *Arthī* *Vyaktā* *Paryāya* *Shabdaka* *Naya* principle would accept that these different meanings are valid, even though they are all associated with the same word.

**Verse 47:** The *Shabdabheda* *Arthabheda* *Arthī* *Vyaktā* *Paryāya* *Shabdaka* *Naya* principle does not accept the *Vyabhichāra* (deviation) of the *Pada* (word). This means that it does not accept the use of words in a way that deviates from the grammatical rules.

**Explanation:**

* **Word-difference meaning-difference meaning-oriented explicit synonym word principle:** This principle accepts that different words can have different meanings even if they refer to the same object.
* **Does not accept the deviation of the word:** This means that the principle does not accept the use of words in a way that deviates from the grammatical rules.
* **Deviation of the word:** This refers to the use of words in a way that is not grammatically correct.

**Example:**

The word "Indra" can refer to the king of the gods, but it cannot be used in a way that is grammatically incorrect. For example, it cannot be used in the plural form, even though there are multiple gods.

**Verse 48:** The *Samamīrūḍha* (equally established) *Naya* (principle) is the one that accepts the *Arthabheda* (meaning-difference) when there is *Shabdabheda* (word-difference). This means that it accepts that different words can have different meanings even if they refer to the same object.

**Explanation:**

* **Equally established principle:** This principle is applied consistently, regardless of the specific words used.
* **Accepts the meaning-difference when there is word-difference:** This means that the principle accepts that different words can have different meanings even if they refer to the same object.
* **Word-difference:** This refers to the use of synonyms or different words to describe the same object.
* **Meaning-difference:** This refers to the different meanings that can be associated with different words, even if they refer to the same object.

**Example:**

The word "Indra" can refer to the king of the gods, but it can also refer to a specific deity with specific powers and attributes. The *Samamīrūḍha* *Naya* principle would accept that these different meanings are valid, even though they are all associated with the same word.

**Verse 47:** The *Samamīrūḍha* *Naya* principle does not accept the *Vyabhichāra* (deviation) of the *Pada* (word). This means that it does not accept the use of words in a way that deviates from the grammatical rules.

**Explanation:**

* **Equally established principle:** This principle is applied consistently, regardless of the specific words used.
* **Does not accept the deviation of the word:** This means that the principle does not accept the use of words in a way that deviates from the grammatical rules.
* **Deviation of the word:** This refers to the use of words in a way that is not grammatically correct.

**Example:**

The word "Indra" can refer to the king of the gods, but it cannot be used in a way that is grammatically incorrect. For example, it cannot be used in the plural form, even though there are multiple gods.

**Note:** The text also mentions the *Nānārth* (multiple meanings) *Samamīrūḍha* (equally established) *Naya* principle, which is a similar principle that accepts the multiple meanings of words. This principle is also discussed in the text.

The *Harivaṃśapurāṇa* states:

"Whatever is Indra, that is Indra, not anything else at the moment of action. The speaker considers it to be thus, as it is truly spoken." (49)

"Because of its infinite power, these seven *nayas* are based on its power. They progressively grasp the subtle nature of things." (50)

"There are five types of *nayas* that are primarily based on meaning, and five that are primarily based on words. Therefore, from the beginning with the *saṃgraha* *naya* to the end, there are six types of *nayas*, i.e., there are hundreds of types of each of the seven *nayas* like *naigama* etc." (51)

"As many paths of speech there are, so many *nayas* there are. Therefore, there are so many *nayas*. Thus, in reality, the number of *nayas* is not fixed." (52)

"Dharma, adharma, ākāśa, pudgala, and kāla are the five non-living principles and are the objects of right faith." (53)

"Of these, dharma and adharma are the causes of motion and rest respectively. That is, dharma is the cause of the movement of the living being and pudgala, and adharma is the cause of their rest. ākāśa is the cause of the penetration of both living and non-living substances." (54)

"The pudgala substance performs the actions of filling and dissolving, and is endowed with many qualities like color, etc. It has two divisions, skandha and atom. Many atoms combine to form a skandha, and the skandha breaks down into atoms." (55)

"That which is characterized by the nature of change is the kāla substance. It has many divisions like time, etc. Because it is endowed with the nature of change, the kāla substance is characterized by the behavior of past and future." (56)

The *samābhīrūḍha* *naya* is primarily concerned with the commonly understood meaning of a word, even if it may have other meanings. For example, the word "cow" is known in the dictionary to have many meanings, such as "voice" etc., but in common usage, it is primarily used to refer to an animal. Or, the *samābhīrūḍha* *naya* is that which does not consider the meaning derived from the combination of the etymology, nature, and suffix of a word, but only considers its current usage. For example, the etymological meaning of the word "cow" is "that which walks," but in common usage, people disregard this meaning and refer to a specific animal as a "cow," whether it is walking, sitting, or standing. (48)

The *evambhūta* *naya* states that a thing should be called by its name only at the moment when it performs that action, not at any other time. This *naya* describes the true nature of a thing. For example, "Indra is called Indra only when he experiences sovereignty, not at any other time." (49)

Substances have infinite powers. These seven *nayas* accept the different aspects of each power and progressively grasp the subtle nature of things. (50)

There are many *nayas* that are primarily based on meaning, and many that are primarily based on words. Therefore, from the beginning with the *saṃgraha* *naya* to the end, there are six types of *nayas*, i.e., there are hundreds of types of each of the seven *nayas* like *naigama* etc. (51)

Because there are as many paths of speech as there are *nayas*, there are so many *nayas*. Thus, in reality, the number of *nayas* is not fixed. (52)

Dharma, adharma, ākāśa, pudgala, and kāla are the five non-living principles and are the objects of right faith. (53)

Of these, dharma and adharma are the causes of motion and rest respectively. That is, dharma is the cause of the movement of the living being and pudgala, and adharma is the cause of their rest. ākāśa is the cause of the penetration of both living and non-living substances. (54)

The pudgala substance performs the actions of filling and dissolving, and is endowed with many qualities like color, etc. It has two divisions, skandha and atom. Many atoms combine to form a skandha, and the skandha breaks down into atoms. (55)

That which is characterized by the nature of change is the kāla substance. It has many divisions like time, etc. Because it is endowed with the nature of change, the kāla substance is characterized by the behavior of past and future. (56)

1. *Evambhūta* *naya* - That by which a thing is known, by that very nature it is understood. (5.1)
2. *Bhidā* *naya* - The *naya* of difference. (5.2)
3. *Saṃgraha* etc. *nayas* - The *nayas* of collection, etc. (5.3)
4. As many paths of speech there are, so many *nayas* there are. (5.4)
5. Past and future are the fields of action of kāla. (5.5)
These are the characteristics of kāla, and they prove the existence of kāla. (5.6)

* *Naigama*, *saṃgraha*, *vyavahāra*, and *ṛju* are the four *arthanayas*, and the remaining three are *śabdanayas*.

## The Eighth Chapter of the Tattvartha Sutra

**667**

The union of body, speech, and mind is called karma. This karma is known as *āsrava*. It is divided into two types based on its auspicious and inauspicious nature. Auspicious karma is the cause of auspicious *āsrava*, and inauspicious karma is the cause of inauspicious *āsrava*. ||57||

The masters of *āsrava* are two: *sakṣāya* (with *kaṣāya*) and *akaṣāya* (without *kaṣāya*). Similarly, there are two types of *āsrava*: *sāmprāyika* *āsrava* and *īryāpatha* *āsrava*. Those who have *kaṣāya* from *mithyādṛṣṭi* to *sūkṣma* *kaṣāya* in the *guṇasthāna* are *sakṣāya* and they are the masters of the initial *sāmprāyika* *āsrava*. Those who have *kaṣāya* from *upaśānta* *kaṣāya* to *sayoga* *kevali* are *akaṣāya* and they are the masters of the final *īryāpatha* *āsrava*. [The *ayoga* *kevali* residing in the fourteenth *guṇasthāna* is also *akaṣāya*, but due to the absence of *yoga*, they do not have *āsrava*]. ||58-59||

The five senses, four *kaṣāya*, five vows like non-violence, and twenty-five actions are the gateways of *sāmprāyika* *āsrava*. ||60||

Among these, the five senses, four *kaṣāya*, and five vows are well-known. Therefore, the nature of the twenty-five actions is explained. Worship of images, scriptures, *arhanta* deities, and true gurus, along with devotion, is known as *samyak* *kriyā*, which enhances *samyaktva*. ||61||

The tendency towards praising other deities due to the rise of evil is known as *mithyātva* *kriyā*, which enhances *mithyātva*. ||62||

The act of going and coming is known as *prayoga* *kriyā*, which generally enhances *asamyam*. ||63||

The tendency of a restrained person towards *asamyam* is known as *samādāna* *kriyā*, which enhances *pramāda*. ||64||

The action that is the cause of *īryāpatha* is known as *īryāpatha* *kriyā*. These five actions are the causes of *sāmprāyika* *āsrava*. ||65||

The action that arises due to the outburst of anger is known as *prādoṣika* *kriyā*. The effort of a person filled with faults is known as *kāyika* *kriyā*. ||66||

The action that involves taking up weapons and other instruments of violence is known as *kriyādhīkarinī* *kriyā*. The action that causes suffering to oneself and others is known as *pārītāpika* *kriyā*. ||67||

The action that causes the separation of the senses, lifespan, strength, and life is known as *prāṇātipātika* *kriyā*. These are the five *adhyātmika* actions. ||68||

Due to the mind being drenched in attachment, when a virtuous person becomes *pramāda*, he desires to see a beautiful form.

## Chapter 68

**7.** The act of touching, which is known as the cause of karma, is to be understood as the act of touching something that is worthy of being touched with excessive carelessness.

**71.** The act that is likely to cause the flow of sin, due to the production of new causes of sin, is called the **pratyayiki** act.

**72.** The act of excreting bodily waste in a place suitable for the meeting of men, women, and animals is called the **samantanupaatini** act. This act is not suitable for the virtuous.

**73.** The act of depositing the body or its parts on the ground without cleaning or inspecting them is called the **anabhoga** act. These five acts are all considered **durikriya** (evil acts).

**74.** The act of doing something that is meant to be done by another person, with one's own hands, is called the **svahasta** act. This act is known to increase the flow of sin mentioned earlier.

**75.** The act of acknowledging one's own sinful tendencies is called the **nisarga** act. This act, by its very nature, increases the flow of sin.

**76.** The act of revealing the sinful actions of others is called the **vidaran** act. This act is known to break the intellect of others.

**77.** The act of misinterpreting the teachings of the scriptures due to delusion, when one is unable to perform the necessary actions according to the teachings, is called the **ajnavyapaadiki** act.

**78.** The act of disregarding the duties prescribed by the scriptures due to deceit or laziness is called the **anaakaanksha** act. These five acts are considered **durikriya** (evil acts).

**79.** The act of being overjoyed at the beginning of an action performed by others, or being excessively eager to perform actions like cutting, piercing, etc., is called the **prarambha** act.

**80.** The act that is focused on acquiring possessions is called the **parigrahiki** act. The act of deception in matters of knowledge, vision, etc., is called the **maya** act.

**81.** The act of encouraging others to adopt false beliefs and strengthening them in those beliefs is called the **mithyadarshan** act.

**82.** The act of not renouncing sin due to the influence of karma is called the **apratyakhyan** act. These five acts are considered **durikriya** (evil acts). Thus, twenty-five acts have been described, five at a time.

## Chapter Forty-Eight

**669**

"Due to the difference in the intensity of the results of the embodied beings, the Asrava is also of three types: mild, moderate, and intense, depending on the cause." || 83 ||

"There are two types of Asrava: Jiva-adhikaran (related to the soul) and Ajiva-adhikaran (related to non-soul). The Jiva-adhikaran Asrava has three main categories: 1. Sanrambh, 2. Samarabh, and 3. Aarambh." || 84 ||

"Each of these three categories has three sub-categories: Krit (done by oneself), Karit (caused by others), and Anumodana (approval). These are further divided into three types of Yoga: Manoyoga (mental), Vachanayoga (verbal), and Kayayoga (physical). Finally, each of these is further divided into four types of Kashaya: Krodha (anger), Mana (pride), Maya (deceit), and Lobha (greed). Thus, there are 36 types of Asrava for each of the three categories, totaling 108 types." || 85 ||

"The Ajiva-adhikaran Asrava has four categories: 1. Nirvartana (removal), 2. Nikshepa (deposit), 3. Samyoga (combination), and 4. Nisarga (nature). Nirvartana has two types: Mulaguna (root quality) and Uttaraguna (secondary quality). Nikshepa has four types: Sahasa (sudden), Duspramshta (unclean), Anabhoga (unused), and Apratyavekshit (unobserved). Samyoga has two types, and Nisarga has three types." || 86 ||

"Mulaguna Nirvartana is the creation of the body, speech, mind, and breath. Uttaraguna Nirvartana is the creation of images, etc., from wood, stone, clay, etc." || 87 ||

"Sahasa Nikshepa is the sudden deposit of an object. Duspramshta Nikshepa is the deposit of an object in a place that has been cleaned with difficulty. Anabhoga Nikshepa is the deposit of an object that is not used. Apratyavekshit Nikshepa is the deposit of an object that is not observed." || 88 ||

**Footnotes:**

1. "The intensity of the Asrava is determined by the intensity of the Jiva's knowledge, ignorance, and the power of the object." || T.S.A. 6 ||
2. "The object of the Asrava is either the Jiva or the Ajiva." || T.S.A. 6 ||
3. "The first category of Asrava is Sanrambh, Samarabh, and Aarambh, which are further divided into three types of Krit, Karit, and Anumodana, and then into three types of Yoga, and finally into four types of Kashaya." || T.S.A. 6 ||
4. "The second category of Asrava is Nirvartana, Nikshepa, Samyoga, and Nisarga, which are divided into two, four, two, and three types respectively." || T.S.A. 6 ||
5. "The Asrava is currently known to us." || M. ||

Page #708:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, it is stated that there are two types of Asrava in the Sangyogadhikaran: Bhaktapan Sangyog and Upakaran Sangyog. Mixing food and drink with other food and drink is Bhaktapan Sangyog, and the indiscriminate mixing of tools is Upakaran Sangyog, such as wiping a hot Kamandalu with a cold cloth. || 86 ||

The Asrava in the Nisargadhikaran is of three types: Va Nisarg, Manon Nisarg, and Karman Nisarg. The free will of speech is called Va Nisarg, the free will of the mind is called Manon Nisarg, and the free will of the body is called Kay Nisarg. || 90 ||

This is the general classification of Karma Asrava. Now, the specific Asrava of Karma, which is differentiated by the types of Jnanavaran, etc., is described. || 91 ||

The actions of Pradosh, Nihn, Aadan, Vighn, Asadan, and Dushan, performed in relation to knowledge, are the Asrava of Jnanavaran, and the actions of Pradosh, etc., performed in relation to perception, are the Asrava of Darshanavaran. When the knowledge of the principles that are the means of liberation is revealed, a person sits silently, but his inner state is becoming polluted. This is called Pradosh. Hiding knowledge due to some reason, such as "I don't have it" or "I don't know," is called Nihn. Not giving knowledge that is worthy of being given due to jealousy is called Aadan. Obstructing knowledge is called Vighn. Preventing knowledge that is worthy of being revealed by others through the body and speech is called Asadan. And finding fault with good knowledge is called Dushan. || 92 ||

There are two types of Vedaniya Karma: 1. Asata Vedaniya and 2. Sata Vedaniya. Among these, the Asrava of Asata Vedaniya are: suffering, sorrow, death, grief, pain, and lamentation, which occur in relation to oneself, others, or both. The painful result is called suffering. The loss of connection with one's beneficial objects results in a state of debility in the results. The separation from life, senses, and strength, etc., is called death. Crying with tears due to suffering, etc., is called grief. The intense remorse in the heart due to the spread of one's slander, etc., in the world is called pain. And lamenting in such a way that the listeners become compassionate, due to the separation from a benefactor, remembering and praising his qualities, is called lamentation. || 93 ||

Compassion for all beings, affection for those who observe vows, Sarag Samyam, charity, forgiveness, purity, being devoted to the worship of the Arhats, and the care of children, the elderly, and ascetics, etc., are the Asrava of Sata Vedaniya. || 94 ||

In the Harivamsha Purana, it is said that "The cause of the hellish lifespan is having many beginnings and many possessions. Maya and the Tiryancha yoni are the causes of the lifespan of the Tiryancha yoni." (10) "The cause of the human lifespan is having few beginnings and few possessions. Being content, being in the state of avrata, and being naturally gentle are also causes of the human lifespan." (109) "Right faith, being a vrati, the practice of balatapas, and being free from desires are the causes of the lifespan of the gods." (110) "The crookedness of one's own yogas and discord with others are the causes of the ashubha karma, and the straightness of one's own yogas and the absence of discord are the causes of the shubha karma." (111) "The special type of karma that is the nature of a Tirthankara has sixteen causes, which are the attainment of perfect knowledge, purity of conduct, etc., and are extremely pure." (112) "Hiding the good qualities of others, praising oneself, and speaking of one's own nonexistent qualities are the causes of the nicha gotra karma." (113) "Being humble in one's conduct and not being arrogant are the causes of the uttama gotra karma, and creating obstacles is the cause of the antaraya karma." (114) "The shubha asrava of punya karma has been described in general terms above. Now, this is being explained for the sake of understanding its specific nature." (115) "Refraining from violence, falsehood, stealing, sexual misconduct, and possessions is the vrata. That vrata is of two types: anuvrata and mahavrata. Refraining from those five sins in some places is anuvrata, and refraining from them in all places is mahavrata." (116) "There are five thoughts for each of the five vratas, which are said to keep those who are engaged in mahavratas and anuvratas steady in their vratas." (117)

1. Having many beginnings and many possessions is the cause of the hellish lifespan. (15)
2. Maya is the cause of the lifespan of the Tiryancha yoni. (16)
3. Having few beginnings and few possessions is the cause of the human lifespan. (17)
4. Being gentle and peaceful is the cause of the lifespan of all beings. (19)
5. Being naturally gentle is also a cause. (18)
6. Right faith is also a cause. (21)
7. Attachment, laziness, lack of control, uncontrolled desires, being free from desires, and the practice of balatapas are the causes of the lifespan of the gods. (20)
8. The crookedness of one's own yogas and discord with others are the causes of the ashubha karma. (22)
9. The opposite of that is the cause of the shubha karma. (23)
10. The attainment of perfect knowledge, purity of conduct, being well-behaved, not being excessive in one's conduct, constant use of knowledge, enthusiasm, strength, abandonment of pride, good conduct, meditation, not being worthy of being a teacher, the teachings of a learned person, devotion, the necessary abandonment of attachment, the practice of the path, the practice of teachings, and love for teachings are the causes of being a Tirthankara. (24)
11. Criticizing others, praising oneself, hiding good qualities, and creating bad qualities are the causes of the nicha gotra karma. (25)
12. The opposite of that, being humble in one's conduct, and not being arrogant are the causes of the uttama gotra karma. (26)
13. Creating obstacles is the cause of the antaraya karma. (27)

**675.** Five observances of the vow of non-stealing are: **dwelling in an empty house**, **dwelling in a liberated house**, **not obstructing others**, **purity of alms**, and **agreement with the righteous**. ||120||

**676.** Five observances of the vow of celibacy are: **abandoning listening to stories that arouse desire for women**, **abandoning looking at their beautiful limbs**, **abandoning adornment of the body**, **abandoning strong flavors**, and **abandoning the remembrance of past sensual pleasures**. ||121||

**678.** Wise people should contemplate that **violence and other sins lead to various kinds of suffering and bondage in this world and the next**. ||123||

**679.** Or, wise people should constantly contemplate that **violence and other sins are nothing but suffering**. Although they are the cause of suffering, they are not suffering themselves, but this contemplation should be done with the understanding that cause and effect are not separate. ||124||

**680.** **Friendship, joy, compassion, and impartiality** should be cultivated towards all beings, those with superior qualities, those who are suffering, and those who are misguided, respectively. **Friendship** is the thought that no being should suffer. **Joy** is the feeling of happiness when seeing those with superior qualities. **Compassion** is the feeling of empathy for those who are suffering. **Impartiality** is the feeling of neutrality towards those who are misguided. ||125||

**681.** Those who are afraid of the cycle of birth and death should constantly contemplate the nature of the world and the body to generate **inner awakening and detachment**. ||126||

**682.** In this world, beings have received ten vital breaths, including the senses. **To carelessly harm them is to harm oneself**. ||127||

Page #712:
---------------------------
## Chapter 674

**12.**  A careless person who causes the separation of a being's life due to being the cause of its suffering, is the cause of *adharma* (unrighteousness) and the cause of bondage. However, for a being who acts with mindfulness and without carelessness, even if the separation of a being's life occurs, it is not the cause of bondage.

**129.** A careless being first destroys its own self through carelessness, and then the killing of other beings may or may not occur.

**130.** Speech that causes suffering to beings, whether it is about something that exists or does not exist, is called *asatyavachan* (false speech) or *anritavachan* (untruthful speech). Conversely, speech that benefits beings is called *ritavachan* (true speech) or *satyavachan* (truthful speech).

**131.** Taking something that has not been given is called *steya* (theft). However, theft occurs only when there is an act driven by the result of *samklesha* (afflictions).

**132.** *Brahmacharya* (celibacy) is the true *brahma* (divine principle) where the qualities of non-violence, etc., flourish. Conversely, the act of engaging in sexual intercourse between a man and a woman is *abrahmacharya* (non-celibacy).

**133.** Attachment to external possessions like cows, horses, gems, pearls, etc., whether they are sentient or insentient, and attachment to internal afflictions like *raga* (attachment), etc., is called *parigraha* (attachment). This *parigraha* is to be abandoned.

**134.** The five vows of non-violence, etc., are the forms of renunciation from these five sins. These vows are of two types: *mahavrat* (great vows) and *anuvrat* (minor vows). One who observes these vows is called a *vrati* (one who observes vows).

**135.** Even if one is connected to vows, one is considered a true *vrati* only if one is free from *shalya* (thorns). *Shalya* is of three types: *maya* (illusion), *nidana* (cause), and *mithyatva* (falsehood). This *shalya* is like thorns, causing suffering.

**136.** There are two types of *vrati*: *sagara* (one who observes minor vows) and *anagara* (one who observes great vows). Those who observe *anuvrat* are called *sagara*, and those who observe *mahavrat* are called *anagara*.

**137.** One who is still attached to *raga* (attachment), even if living in the forest, is a *sagara* householder. One who has renounced *raga* (attachment), even if living in a house, is an *anagara*.

**138.** The first *anuvrat* called *ahimsa* (non-violence) is the renunciation of harming stationary and mobile beings.

## Chapter Forty-Eight

**The Second Anuvrata:**  Where there is abstinence from falsehood, motivated by attachment, aversion, and delusion, that is the second Anuvrata. (139)

**The Third Anuvrata:**  Where there is abstinence from taking what is not given, whether it be a large or small amount of another's lost or forgotten property, that is the third Anuvrata. (140)

**The Fourth Anuvrata:**  Where there is abstinence from sexual desire for another's wife, and contentment with one's own wife, that is the fourth Anuvrata. (141)

**The Fifth Anuvrata:**  Where there is a conscious and deliberate limitation of possessions, such as gold, servants, houses, and land, that is the fifth Anuvrata, known as "Buddhechcha Parimaan." (142)

**The Three Gunavratas:**  A householder who observes the five Anuvratas also observes three Gunavratas. (143)

**The First Gunavrata:**  Where there is abstinence from transgressing the limits established by known landmarks and directions, that is the first Gunavrata, known as "Digvirati." (144)

**The Second Gunavrata:**  Where there is abstinence from going outside the limits of a village, town, or other area, established for a specific period of time, that is the second Gunavrata, known as "Deshavirati." (145)

**The Five Anarthadandas:**  There are five types of Anarthadandas:  1)  Pापोपदेश (giving advice that leads to sin), 2)  अपध्यान (thinking about harming others), 3)  प्रमादाचरित (acting carelessly), 4)  हिंसादान (giving instruments of violence), and 5)  दुःश्रुति (listening to or teaching harmful stories). (146)

**The Third Gunavrata:**  Where there is abstinence from the Anarthadanda of giving advice that leads to sin, which is harmful and causes suffering, that is the third Gunavrata, known as "Anarthadanda Tyaga." (147)

**Pापोपदेश Anarthadanda:**  Giving advice that leads to sin, such as encouraging someone to engage in harmful activities like killing, binding, or stealing. (148)

**अपध्यान Anarthadanda:**  Thinking about harming others, such as contemplating how to kill, bind, or steal from them. (149)

**प्रमादाचरित Anarthadanda:**  Acting carelessly, such as cutting down trees, digging up the earth, or wasting water. (150)

**हिंसादान Anarthadanda:**  Giving instruments of violence, such as poison, thorns, weapons, fire, ropes, sticks, and whips. (151)

**दुःश्रुति Anarthadanda:**  Listening to or teaching harmful stories that promote violence, attachment, aversion, and delusion. (152)

**The Samayika Vrata:**  The Samayika Vrata is a practice of meditation and contemplation, where one focuses on the oneness of all beings, remembers the divine, and reflects on the nature of happiness, suffering, enemies, and friends. (153)

---------------------------
## Chapter 676

**15.** In the Harivamsha Purana, it is stated that those who abstain from all four types of food during the four festivals of Nirarambha, and who practice the Proshdhopavasa, are those who have withdrawn their senses from the external world and reside within their own selves.

**155.**  Those who use things like fragrances, garlands, food, and drink are engaging in **Upamoga** (consumption). Those who use things like seats and other possessions are engaging in **Paribhoga** (possession).

**156.** The amount of Upamoga and Paribhoga should be determined according to one's capacity and as per the scriptures. This is the **Upamoga-Paribhoga-Parimana** vow.

**157.** Abstaining from meat, alcohol, honey, gambling, prostitutes, and eating at night, as well as abandoning the killing of living beings, is known as the **Niyama** vow.

**158.** One who constantly wanders for the sake of increasing their restraint is called an **Atithi** (guest). Offering them food and other necessities according to the scriptures and with purity is the **Atithi-Samvibhaga** vow.

**159.** There are four types of Atithi-Samvibhaga, based on the differences in begging, medicine, equipment, and shelter.

**160.** When death is imminent, one should practice **Sallekhana**, which involves completely emaciating the body externally and the passions internally. This Sallekhana is mandatory for a vow-taker at the time of death.

**161.** When death is inevitable, Sallekhana should be practiced according to the scriptures to prevent the arising of passions.

**162.** Doubt, desire, and other eight defects are the **Atichara** (transgressions) of **Samyag Darshan** (right faith), which are opposed to the eight limbs of the path of liberation. These should be abandoned by the virtuous.

**163.** There are five Atichara for each of the five Anuvrata (minor vows) and seven Shila Vrata (major vows). These are described here in order. Those who practice these vows should avoid these transgressions.

**164.** Restraining the movement of living beings, excessive beating with a stick, cutting off ears and other body parts, loading excessive weight, and obstructing hunger and thirst are all transgressions.

**Harivamsha Purana**

The giver's nature is diverse, some are free from envy, sorrow, etc., while others are afflicted by them. The mind's movement is indeed diverse. ||189||

Among those who are worthy of receiving the gifts that are the cause of liberation, the difference in the purity of their minds is the characteristic of the recipient. ||190||

The flow of merit is said to be the cause of happiness and prosperity, while the flow of demerit is considered to be the cause of worldly suffering. ||191||

Thus, after describing the principle of *āsrava*, the divine voice of the Lord began to describe the principle of *bandha*.

False perception, non-restraint from violence, etc., delusion, passions, and yoga, which are present in the transformations of the soul, are the causes of bondage. ||192||

Among these, false perception is of two types: innate (unlearned) and learned. The lack of faith in the truth, which arises from the rise of falsehood, is innate false perception. ||193||

And the lack of faith in the truth, which arises from the teachings of others, is called learned false perception. This is of four types: action-oriented, inaction-oriented, respectful, and ignorant. ||194||

Besides these, false perception is also considered to be of five types, depending on the cause: solitary, opposite, respectful, ignorant, and doubtful.

To believe that a thing is of one nature, while it is actually of many natures, is solitary false perception, such as believing that a thing is eternal or non-eternal.

To believe the opposite of the true nature of a thing is opposite false perception, such as believing that there is virtue in violence, or that liberation is attained by wearing a garment.

To believe that all beings are equal, without distinguishing between gods and non-gods, and the true and the untrue, and to worship all of them, is respectful false perception.

To believe in something based on ignorance and tradition, without examining what is beneficial and harmful, is ignorant false perception.

To doubt whether right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct are the path to liberation or not, whether there is virtue in non-violence or violence, is doubtful false perception. ||195||

Not abandoning the killing of the six types of beings, namely, the five stationary and the three mobile, and not controlling the five senses and the mind, are the twelve types of non-restraint. Delusion is of many types, and there are twenty-five types of passions, including the nine root passions, along with their infinite consequences, such as anger, pride, deceit, and greed. ||196||

There are four types of mental yoga: true mental yoga, false mental yoga, mixed mental yoga, and unmixed mental yoga. There are four types of verbal yoga: true verbal yoga, false verbal yoga, mixed verbal yoga, and unmixed verbal yoga. There are five types of physical yoga: true physical yoga, false physical yoga, mixed physical yoga, unmixed physical yoga, and mixed physical yoga with food. Thus, there are thirteen types of yoga in total. ||197||

The difference in the nature of the gift given leads to a difference in the fruit of the gift. ||188||

Some givers are free from envy, sorrow, etc., while others are afflicted by them. This is the characteristic of the giver. The mind's movement is indeed diverse. ||189||

Among those who are worthy of receiving the gifts that are the cause of liberation, the difference in the purity of their minds is the characteristic of the recipient. ||190||

The flow of merit is said to be the cause of happiness and prosperity, while the flow of demerit is considered to be the cause of worldly suffering. ||191||

## Chapter 681

**Verse 19:** These five are the causes of bondage, both collectively and individually.  The five are due to false belief, and the last four are due to the last three.

**Verse 199:** The three causes of bondage in the fifth state of being are: restraint, unrestraint, and mixed, and the three causes of bondage in the sixth state of being are: carelessness, passions, and karma.

**Verse 200:** The three causes of bondage in the sixth state of being are: carelessness, passions, and karma.  The two causes of bondage in the next four states of being, from the seventh to the tenth, are: passions and karma.

**Verse 201:**  Those in the states of subdued delusion, diminished delusion, and those who are liberated with karma, are bound by karma only through karma.  The liberated ones, without karma, are not bound by karma.

**Verse 202:**  The soul, tainted by passions, takes up particles suitable for karma every moment.  This is called bondage, and it is considered to be of many kinds.

**Verse 203:**  Bondage, in general, is of four types, based on its nature, state, experience, and location.

**Verse 204:**  Nature refers to the inherent quality.  Just as the nature of neem is bitterness, so too, all karmas have their own inherent nature.

**Verse 205:**  The nature of knowledge-obscuring karma is ignorance, i.e., not allowing the knowledge of objects.  The nature of perception-obscuring karma is non-perception, i.e., not allowing the perception of objects.

**Verse 206:**  The nature of karmas that are experienced as pleasant and unpleasant is to cause the experience of pleasure and pain in those who are knowledgeable.

**Verse 207:**  The nature of perception-delusion karma is to cause disbelief in the truth.  The nature of extreme character-delusion karma is to cause constant unrestraint.

**Verse 208:**  The nature of the karma of action is to determine the duration of existence.  The nature of the karma of name is to cause the birth of a being as a god, a hell-being, etc.

**Verse 197:**  In the state of being of the careless and restrained, there is also the possibility of the karma of food and the karma of mixed food.  Therefore, when these are included, there are fifteen types of karma.

**Explanation:**  These five, false belief, etc., are the causes of bondage, both collectively and individually.  That is, sometimes they are the cause of all bondage, and sometimes they are the cause of less bondage.  In the state of being of false belief, all five are the causes of bondage.  In the three states of being after that, the last four are the causes of bondage, excluding false belief.

**Explanation:**  In the fifth state of being, called restrained and unrestrained, the three causes of bondage are: restraint, unrestraint, and mixed, and the three causes of bondage in the sixth state of being are: carelessness, passions, and karma.

**Explanation:**  The three causes of bondage in the sixth state of being are: carelessness, passions, and karma.  The two causes of bondage in the next four states of being, from the seventh to the tenth, are: passions and karma.

**Explanation:**  Those in the states of subdued delusion, diminished delusion, and those who are liberated with karma, are bound by karma only through karma.  The liberated ones, without karma, are not bound by karma.

## English Translation:

682
In the Harivamsha Purana, the classification of Gotra into high and low, and the description of its place, as well as the creation of Antaray karma, which obstructs giving and other actions, is described. ||20||

Therefore, the characteristic of karma is that which is done by it, that is the bondage of nature, and its non-deviation from its own nature is the bondage of state. ||210||

Just as the milk of goats, cows, and buffaloes does not deviate from its own nature of sweetness, similarly, karma does not deviate from its own nature. ||211||

Just as there are different tastes in milk, such as intense or mild, similarly, there are different strengths in karma-like pudgalas, such as intense or mild. This is considered the bondage of experience. ||212||

The number of divisions, or sections, in the aggregate of karma-transformed pudgalas of the soul, as measured by the size of an atom, is called the bondage of space. ||213||

The bondage of nature and space are caused by yoga, and the bondage of state and experience are caused by kshaya. ||214||

That which covers knowledge, or which itself covers knowledge, is called the karma of knowledge-obscuration. Similarly, one should know the definition of the karma of vision-obscuration, that which covers vision, or which itself covers vision. ||215||

That which causes the experience of pleasure and pain, or which itself experiences pleasure and pain, is called the karma of experience. That which deludes the soul, or which itself deludes, is called the karma of delusion. ||216||

That which causes the soul to attain hellish realms, or which itself attains hellish realms, is called the karma of destiny. That which causes the soul to be named with various names, or which itself is endowed with various names, is called the karma of name. ||217||

That by which the soul is called high or low with effort is called Gotra, and that which comes in between giving and other actions with effort is called Antaray karma. ||218||

Just as food once eaten becomes transformed into various forms like juice, blood, etc., similarly, pudgalas, once taken in by the soul, become transformed into various forms of karma. ||219||

This is the eight-fold division of the original nature, influenced by the eight types of karma. The division of the subsequent natures is described further. ||220||

_The bondage of space, state, experience, and kshaya is caused by karma. There is no cause for bondage in the un-transformed, un-divided state._ ||Go. Karma.||

## Chapter Forty-Eight

The **knowledge-obscuring karma** is of five types, the **perception-obscuring karma** is of nine types, the **karmas to be experienced** are of two types, and the **delusion karma** is of twenty-eight types. ||221||

The **lifespan** is of four types, the **name** is of forty-two types, the **lineage** is of two types, and the **hindrances** are of five types. ||222||

The **five** **karmas to be obscured** are: **knowledge of perception**, **knowledge from scriptures**, **clairvoyance**, **knowledge of the mind**, and **omniscience**. The **five** **counter-natures** of karma, which obscure these five karmas, are: **knowledge of perception obscuring karma**, **knowledge from scriptures obscuring karma**, **clairvoyance obscuring karma**, **knowledge of the mind obscuring karma**, and **omniscience obscuring karma**. ||223||

From the perspective of **substance**, even an **unliberated being** possesses the **power** of **knowledge of the mind** and **omniscience**. Therefore, all five types of **knowledge-obscuring karma** are present in them. ||224||

The **liberated being** is **liberated** because of the **potential** for the manifestation of these **qualities**. The **unliberated being** is **unliberated** because of the **lack of potential** for the manifestation of **omniscience** and **knowledge of the mind**. ||225||

The **four** **perception-obscuring karmas** are: **visual perception obscuring karma**, **non-visual perception obscuring karma**, **clairvoyance obscuring karma**, and **omniscience obscuring karma**. These four, along with the **five** **types of sleep** (**sleep**, **half-sleep**, **drowsiness**, **deep drowsiness**, and **stupor**), constitute the **nine** **counter-natures** of **perception-obscuring karma**. ||226||

**Sleep** is a state of **rest** that removes **pride** and **regret**. **Half-sleep** is a state of **deep sleep**. ||227||

Page #722:
---------------------------
684
Harivamsha Purana
The sleep that arises from fatigue, etc., makes the living being restless. This is called Prachala. When Prachala occurs repeatedly in an excessive manner, it is called Prachala-Prachala. ||228||
The one by which the soul becomes lethargic, i.e., desires something in sleep, and becomes active in some karma, is called Styanagridhi. This is the five types of sleep, which arise from the उदय of Darshanavarana karma, and through these sleeps, Darshanavarana karma destroys the Darshanaguna of the soul. ||229||
There are two types of Vedaniya karma: Saata-Vedaniya and Asaata-Vedaniya. Those which cause physical and mental happiness and sorrow are called Saata-Vedaniya and Asaata-Vedaniya respectively. ||230||
There are two main types of Mohaniya karma: 1. Darshanamohiya, 2. Charitramohiya. Of these, Darshanamohiya has three Uttar-Prakritis: Samyaktva, Mithyatva, and Samyamithyatva. ||231||
When the power of the Mithyatva-Prakriti to give its स्वरस-फल is stopped by the auspicious परिणाम of the soul, then the Samyaktva-Prakriti arises in the जीव who has श्रद्धान. With the उदय of this Prakruti, the श्रद्धानगुण of the soul is not destroyed, but it becomes contaminated with चल, मल, and अगाढ़ दोष. ||232||
With the उदय of the Mithyatva-Prakriti, the श्रद्धानगुण becomes distorted and results in अतत्त्व श्रद्धान. Similar to the मदशक्ति of a half-pure कोदों, when the Mithyatva-Prakriti becomes half-pure, the जीव's pure and impure भाव manifest together, which is called Samyamithyatva. With the उदय of the Samyamithyatva-Prakriti, the जीव's परिणाम become like the mixed taste of curd and jaggery, i.e., श्रद्धान and अश्रद्धान. ||233||
There are two types of Charitramoha based on the difference between नोकषाय and कषाय. Of these, there are nine types of नोकषाय and sixteen types of कषाय. ||234||
Haasya, Rati, Arati, Shoka, Bhaya, Jugupsa, Strived, Purushaved, and Napumsakaved are the nine types of नोकषाय. Their characteristics are as follows: The one whose उदय causes उत्सुक हास्य to manifest is Haasya karma. The one whose उदय causes Rati-Preeti to arise is Rati karma. The one whose उदय causes Arati-Aapreeti to arise is Arati. The one whose उदय causes Shoka is Shoka. The one that causes Udveg-Bhaya is Bhaya. The one whose उदय causes a tendency to hide one's faults is Jugupsa. The one whose उदय causes the जीव to attain the भाव of a woman, i.e., the desire to enjoy with a man, is Strived. The one whose उदय causes the जीव to attain the भाव of a man, i.e., the desire to enjoy with a woman, is Purushaved. And the one whose उदय causes the जीव to attain the भाव of a नपुंसक, i.e., the desire to enjoy with both a woman and a man, is Napumsakaved. ||235-237||

## Chapter Forty-Eight

**685**

The eight passions, namely anger, pride, deceit, and greed, are destructive to right faith and right conduct, and they have infinite consequences. 

**238**

If the soul, due to their arising, is unable to renounce violence and other negative actions, then those passions are called "unrenounceable veils."

**239**

If the soul, due to their arising, is unable to attain self-control, then those passions are called "renounceable veils."

**240**

If the soul, due to their arising, is unable to manifest right conduct as it is described, and they remain burning with passion despite self-control, then those passions are called "burning."

**241**

There are four types of lifespan karma, namely hellish, animal, human, and divine. Due to the arising of lifespan karma, the soul is born in the corresponding realms.

**242**

The karma that causes the soul to experience different births is called "motion karma." There are four types of motion karma, based on the realms of gods, hell beings, etc.

**243**

The karma that causes the soul to experience hellish and other realms is called "hellish karma." There are four types of hellish karma.

**244**

The state that brings the soul into alignment with the same qualities of the realms it experiences is called "caste." The karma that causes this caste is called "caste karma." There are five types of caste karma, namely one-sense, etc.

**245**

The karma that causes the soul to experience the one-sense caste, etc., is called "one-sense caste karma," etc.

**246**

The karma that causes the formation of the five types of bodies, namely noble, etc., is called "noble body karma," etc.

**247**

The karma that causes the differentiation of limbs and organs in the body is called "limb karma," etc. There are three types of limb karma, starting with noble limb karma.

**248**

Those who create the location and size of the senses, such as eyes, etc., in relation to the caste, are called "creators."

**249**

The eight passions have four divisions based on their infinite consequences, unrenounceable veils, renounceable veils, and burning. Then, each of these has four divisions based on anger, pride, deceit, and greed. Thus, there are sixteen divisions of the eight passions. Among these, anger, pride, deceit, greed, wrong faith, and wrong conduct are destructive to right faith and right conduct.

## 82. The Chapter on the Eight-Forty-Five: The Cause of Tirthankarahood, the Tirthankara Name Karma, and its Nature

**28.** The Tirthankara name karma is the cause of Tirthankarahood. There are ninety-nine further natures of this name karma.

**10.** There are two types of Gotra karma: **Uchcha Gotra** (high lineage) and **Nīcha Gotra** (low lineage). Birth in a noble family is due to the **Uchcha Gotra**, while birth in a low family is due to the **Nīcha Gotra**.

**280.** **Dāna-antarāya** (obstacle to giving) is the karma that prevents a being from giving even when they desire to do so. **Lābha-antarāya** (obstacle to gain) is the karma that prevents a being from gaining even when they desire to do so.

**281.** **Bhoga-antarāya** (obstacle to enjoyment) is the karma that prevents a being from enjoying even when they desire to do so. **Upbhoga-antarāya** (obstacle to consumption) is the karma that prevents a being from consuming even when they desire to do so.

**282.** **Vīrya-antarāya** (obstacle to effort) is the karma that prevents a being from putting forth effort even when they desire to do so. This is the nature of **Bandha** (bondage).

**283.** **Sthiti-bandha** (bondage of duration) is of two types: **Jghanya** (inferior) and **Utkrisht** (superior), depending on the intensity of the karma. This applies to all eight karmas.

**284.** The **Utkrisht** duration of **Jñāna-āvaraṇa** (knowledge obscuring karma), **Darśana-āvaraṇa** (perception obscuring karma), **Vedaniya** (sensory karma), and **Antarāya** (obstacle karma) is thirty **Koți-koți** (billions of billions) of **Sāgara** (oceans).

**285.** The **Utkrisht** duration of **Moha-niya** (delusion karma) is seventy **Koți-koți** **Sāgara**. The **Utkrisht** duration of **Nāma** (name karma) and **Gotra** (lineage karma) is twenty **Koți-koți** **Sāgara**. This **Utkrisht** duration applies only to **Sañjñī** (conscious), **Pañc-endriya** (five-sensed), **Paryāpta** (sufficient) beings.

**286.** The **Utkrisht** duration of **Āyu** (life span karma) is thirty-three **Sāgara**. The **Jghanya** duration of **Vedaniya** is twelve **Muhurta** (moments).

**287.** The **Jghanya** duration of **Nāma** and **Gotra** is eight **Muhurta**. The **Jghanya** duration of the remaining five karmas is **Antar-muhurta** (within a moment).

The specific ripening of the *bhavasrava* due to the intensity, mildness, etc., of the *kashaya* is called *anubhava*, or the various ripenings of karma due to the differences in substance, field, time, existence, and feeling are called *anubhava-bandha*. ||288-289||
Just as the *anubhava-bandha* of the auspicious natures is excellent due to the results, so the *anubhava-bandha* of the inauspicious natures is inferior, and just as the *anubhava-bandha* of the inauspicious natures is excellent due to the special characteristics of the inauspicious results, so the *anubhava-bandha* of the auspicious natures is inferior. ||290-291||
All the root natures of karma are experienced by themselves, and the similar natures of the subsequent natures are experienced by both themselves and others, except for the *mohaniya* and *ayus* karmas. ||292||

## Chapter Forty-Eight

**293.** Karma is destroyed by experience and penance. There are two types of destruction: one is **vipakaja** (destruction due to fruition) and the other is **avipakaja** (destruction not due to fruition).

**294.** The destruction of karma due to fruition is the gradual cessation of karma as it bears fruit in the cycle of birth and death.

**295.** The destruction of karma not due to fruition is like ripening fruits like mangoes and jackfruits prematurely through certain methods. It is the destruction of karma that has not yet reached its fruition, but is destroyed prematurely through penance and other methods.

**296-297.** The bond of karma with the soul is called **pradeshabandha**. This bond is present in all the infinite regions of the soul. The karma particles, which are as numerous as the parts of a **ghanaangula** (a measure of length), remain in the soul for a period of time, which can be counted as one, two, three, etc.

**298.** There are two types of karma: **punyabandha** (bond of merit) and **papbandha** (bond of demerit). The four types of **punyabandha** are: auspicious lifespan, auspicious name, auspicious lineage, and good conduct. All other karmas are **papbandha**.

**299.** The cessation of **asrava** (influx of karma) is called **samvara**. There are two types of **samvara**: **bhavasamvara** (cessation of the cause of karma) and **dravya samvara** (cessation of the substance of karma).

**300.** **Bhavasamvara** is the cessation of the actions that are the cause of rebirth. **Dravyasamvara** is the cessation of the karma particles themselves.

**292.** The **uttaraprakritis** (secondary qualities) of the **ayukarma** (karma of lifespan) always arise from their own source and not from another source. For example, the **narakayuka** (karma of hell) always manifests as the hellish lifespan and not as any other lifespan.

**Note:** The terms in bold are Jain terms.

In the Harivamsha Purana, it is said, "There are three secrets, five committees, ten virtues, twelve contemplations, five conducts, and twenty-two victories over the six enemies. These, with their detailed explanations, are the causes of liberation." [300-302]
The liberation of a monk, who is free from the bonds of karma, is achieved through the absence of the causes of bondage and the complete destruction of karma through its exhaustion. [303]
The right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct of the seven principles, starting with the soul, are the direct means of liberation. [304]
Some beings attain liberation in a single lifetime, while others, after enjoying the pleasures of heaven, attain liberation in seven or eight lifetimes through constant meditation. [305]
Hearing this pure path of liberation spoken by the Jina, the twelve assemblies bowed down to the Lord with folded hands. [306]
Among the listeners, some attained right faith, some attained self-control and non-self-control, and some, fearing the cycle of birth and death, embraced complete self-control and the vows of a monk. [307]
At that time, two thousand kings, two thousand princesses, and thousands of queens embraced the complete self-control taught by the Jina. [308]
Shiva, Rohini, Devaki, Rukmini, and other goddesses accepted the conduct of the lay followers. [309]
The best kings of the Yadu and Bhoj clans, along with many princesses, became knowers of the Jina's path and became followers of the twelve minor vows. [310]
Indra and Balabhadra, along with Krishna and other Yadavas, who had already performed worship with the gods, bowed down to the Jina, who is like the sun, and departed to their respective abodes. [311]

The 48th Chapter: 'The season, which was making the sky-dome beautiful with pure planets and stars, and which was offering a garland of fragrant, fresh flowers of *bandhuka*, lotus, and *saptaparna*, came near the feet of the Jina, like the three worlds filled with devotion.' ||32||
Thus ends the 48th Chapter of the *Harivaṃśa* Purāṇa, composed by Jinaseṇa Ācārya, which is a collection of the *Ariṣṭanemi* Purāṇa, and which describes the Dharma-upadesa of Śrī Neminātha Bhagavān. ||58||

The sixty-first chapter: Hail, may you be victorious, may you be pleased, the time has come for you to work for the welfare of the world. Indeed, this is the greatness of the Lord. ||12|| Then, the Lord Jinendra ascended the lotus-shaped chariot, and the earth seemed to tremble with joy. ||13|| At that time, the sound of the divine drums, which overpowered the sound of the clouds, was heard, proclaiming: "The Lord of the universe, the victor, is moving forward, carrying the wheel of Dharma, for the prosperity of all beings. By his movement, the beings of the three worlds will be enriched, their wealth will increase, and they will be free from excessive rain and other calamities." ||14-15|| At that time, the auspicious sound of the trumpet, accompanied by the sounds of the vina, flute, mridanga, large cymbals, conch, and kahl, was drowning out the roar of the ocean. ||16|| The great sound of departure, filled with excellent stories, shouts, songs, laughter, and other sounds of joy, filled the space between heaven and earth. ||17|| In the sky, the Kinnaris sang beautiful songs, the Apsaras danced, the Gandharvas and other gods played drums with joy, and humans, gods, and demons, bowing down, praised the Lord, who was worthy of worship by the virtuous, with auspicious hymns of victory. ||18-19|| On the earth too, everywhere, people were filled with divine dances, music, and instruments that captivated the mind. ||20|| The Lokapalas, accompanied by their retinues, were protecting everyone from all directions. It is right, for it is the duty of servants to be well-established in their duties and serve their masters. ||21|| Many gods, with radiant eyes, were chasing away all violent beings from all sides. ||22|| At that time, the joyful ocean, with its waves raised like hands adorned with rings of jewels, bowed down with its head in the form of a wave, and offered salutations to the Lord. ||23||

Harivamsha Purana
"With the slow rise and fall of thousands of suns,
With the names and glories of the radiant ones,
Step by step, they bowed in reverence. ||24||
With millions of shining crowns, the gods touched the earth,
The ground before the Lord was adorned like a lotus-bed. ||25||
Those whose radiance filled the ends of the world,
Went before the Lord, like the light of the Lord of the World, embodied. ||26||
Padma and Saraswati, adorned with auspicious offerings,
With lotus hands, went before the Supreme Lord. ||27||
"Be pleased, O Lord, be pleased!"
With folded hands, Indra, along with the kings of the earth, went before the Lord. ||28||
Thus, the Lord, adorned with the families of the three worlds,
Bearing the prosperity of all the worlds, for the benefit of all beings,
With the lotus banner, with a pure soul,
Mounted the supreme lotus chariot. ||29||
Victorious Lord, victorious elder, victorious father of the world,
Victorious self-born, victorious Lord of the self, victorious God, victorious Achyuta,
Victorious bond of the entire world, victorious leader of the righteous path,
Victorious refuge of all, victorious holder of Lakshmi, victorious virtuous, victorious best. ||30-31||

● The sound of the virtuous, rising and resounding, filled the sky and earth.
"Victory!" the high, deep, thunderous sound echoed. ||33||
The Lord was being honored. ||23||
At that time, the radiant crowns of the gods, who were bowing to the Lord, were shining brightly, rising and falling. It seemed as if thousands of suns were rising and setting together. When the millions of crowns of those gods touched the earth, the ground before the Lord was adorned as if millions of lotuses had been offered. ||24-25||
Those whose radiance filled the ends of the world, those who were the end of the world, were walking before the Lord, and they seemed as if the light of the Lord of the World, the Jina, was embodied and walking before them. ||26||
Padma and Saraswati, whose families were adorned with auspicious offerings, and whose hands held lotuses, were circumambulating the Lord and walking before him. ||27||
"O God! Be pleased here, be pleased here." Thus, Indra, who had folded his hands in reverence, was walking before the Lord, along with the kings of the earth. ||28||
Thus, the Lord, who was surrounded by the Indras of the three worlds and their families, who was bearing the prosperity of all the worlds for the benefit of all beings, who was adorned with the lotus banner, whose soul was pure, and who was like the best sun for the blossoming of the beautiful lotus-like beings, when he mounted the lotus chariot, the gods began to utter these words like thunder: "O Lord! Victory to you, O elder! Victory to you, O father of the world! Victory to you, O self-born! Victory to you, O Lord of the self! Victory to you, O God! Victory to you, O Achyuta! Victory to you, O bond of the entire world! Victory to you, O master of the righteous path! Victory to you, O refuge of all, holder of Lakshmi! Victory to you, O virtuous! Victory to you, O best! Victory to you." Thus, the loud, deep, thunderous sound of the virtuous, which was like the roar of thunder, filled the space between the sky and the earth, and was very beautiful. ||29-33||
1. The word "vilambita" is used to indicate the slowness of the movement. 2. The rise and fall of the suns. 3. The name and glory of the radiant one. 4. The warriors. 5. The end of the world. 6. The gods are pleased. 7. The sound of the virtuous. 8. The sound of victory.

English translation preserving Jain terms:

The sixty-ninth chapter, in which the Lord, who is the auspiciousness of the world, is praised by all the Indras. His lotus feet are covered by the bees, which are the crowns of those Indras. ॥34॥ The goddess who resides in those lotus feet delights the world with compassion for the beings. ॥35॥ The Lord, with his lotus feet placed on the divine lotus, shines like the reflection of a lotus in clear water. ॥36॥ The king of kings, the Prabhus, goes ahead of him for the welfare of the world, shining like the dawn. ॥37॥ That path, adorned with golden ornaments and shining gems, is praised like a chaste wife devoted to her husband. ॥38॥ The Maruts purify that path with their sweet breezes, just as the virtuous purify their conduct with pure actions. ॥39॥ There, the celestials, carried by cloud-vehicles, surround him, their faces illuminated by the flashing lightning. ॥40॥ The path is adorned by the swarms of bees intoxicated with the flowers of the Mandara tree, just as the knowers of the path are delighted by the company of the celestials. ॥41॥ The path shines with the luster of the golden-hued jewel-like stars scattered on the ground. ॥42॥ The Guhyakas collect colorful leaves with saffron juices, as if displaying their skill in artistic crafts. ॥43॥ The boundaries of the path are made beautiful with rows of banana, coconut, sugarcane, and areca nut trees, like a delightful garden. ॥44॥

In the Harivamsha Purana, there were continuous beautiful Krodaka places where happy human beings and gods were playing with their beloved ones. ||45|| Just as in the Bhoga-bhoomi, the Bhogi beings get objects of enjoyment according to their desires, in the same way, in that path, the Bhogi beings were getting all kinds of objects of enjoyment, endowed with excellent Vibhuti, in between. ||46|| That path of the Lord's journey was made three yojanas wide, and the boundaries on both sides of the path were two kosas wide. ||47|| That path was adorned with toranas built in places and with golden Ashtamangaladravya that were visible to the eye, as if it were adorned by the senses themselves. ||48|| In the path, there were large Kamashalas built in places, which gave objects of enjoyment to the Bhogis according to their desires, which seemed as if they were the embodied Danashaktas of the Lord, giving objects of enjoyment according to their desires. ||49|| The path was covered with tall banana trees and flags in the middle ground of the toranas, and it was so dense with shade that it began to block the sun's rays. ||50|| The gods who lived in the forest had prepared a flower pavilion that looked yellow, made from a group of forest blossoms, which seemed like a group of their own merit. ||51|| That flower pavilion was adorned with walls decorated with pictures of jeweled vines, was two yojanas wide, was adorned near the luminous circle of the moon and sun, was making the directions resound with the tinkling of small bells and the sound of bells, and its both ends and the middle interval were adorned with strings of pearls. It was shining brightly with a group of bumblebees hovering all around, attracted by the excellent fragrance, and its canopy in the sky looked like the embodied glory of the Lord. Four garlands made of large pearls, adorned with coral in between, were hanging from the four corners of that pavilion, which were standing tall like pillars, and it was becoming more beautiful because of them. The Lord Nemijinedra, the embodiment of compassion, the suppressor of evil, the self-illuminated, was situated in the middle of that pavilion, and was wandering for the benefit of all beings. ||52-56||

All beings see their seven past and seven future births in the radiant halo behind the Lord, where the ultimate brilliance shines. || 57 ||

Three umbrellas, supremely pure, adorned the Lord's head, embodying the essence of the three worlds. They seemed to proclaim the Lord's sovereignty over the three realms. || 58 ||

Thousands of self-moving fly whisks, like swans around Mount Meru, adorned the Lord. || 59 ||

Rishis followed the Lord, surrounded by gods. Indra, as the doorkeeper, walked ahead with the eight Vasus. || 60 ||

Then, Lakshmi, the embodiment of the three worlds, accompanied by Sachi, holding auspicious offerings, followed Indra. She seemed like a reflection of the Lakshmi of pure knowledge. || 61 ||

All the gods, accompanied by their consorts, followed, bearing auspicious offerings. For the Lord's auspicious journey is always filled with auspicious offerings. || 62 ||

Two treasuries, Shankha and Padma, led the way, adorned with radiant crowns. They granted the desires of all beings and showered them with gold and jewels. || 63 ||

Naga Kumaras, with serpents adorned with radiant gem-like lamps on their hoods, followed. They seemed to emulate the lamp of pure knowledge, which dispels the darkness of ignorance. || 64 ||

All the Agni Kumaras, holding censers, followed. The fragrance of the incense spread to the ends of the world, signifying the fragrance of the Jina. || 65 ||

Devotees of the Lord, the Moon and Sun, with their serene and fiery qualities, followed, carrying auspicious mirrors reflecting their own radiance. || 66 ||

Golden umbrellas were erected to shield the Lord from the heat. They seemed to enclose everything, protecting from the heat. || 67 ||

In the Harivamsha Purana, the banners, like hands, were waving, defeating the opponents. The merciful ones, like the forms of the Lord, were dancing, like victory flags. ||18||
The glorious victory banner, named Vijayanti, was shining brightly. It was like the pure moonlight illuminating the lotus-like eyes of the three worlds. ||69||
The goddesses, who reside in the lower and upper worlds, and those who dwell in various places on earth, were dancing in front of the Lord, expressing eight emotions of love and joy. ||70||
The sound of the Nandi, which filled all directions and sub-directions with its deep and sweet melody, resonated repeatedly, having conquered the clouds of the rainy season. ||71||
The Dharmachakra, which had conquered the sun with its brilliance, was adorned with thousands of rays of light. Surrounded by a group of gods, it was destroying the darkness of the sky. ||72||
The roaring gods, who were marching ahead, proclaimed with their shouts, "This is the Lord of all the worlds. Come, come, and bow down to him." ||73||
At that time, many excellent celestial beings, following the influence of Lord Neminath, were running through all directions and paths, shouting victory cries. ||74||
Those who accompanied the Lord on this divine journey, filled with many wonders, received all kinds of wonders on earth, including the sight of wealth. ||75||

There, the blind could see, the deaf could hear, the mute could speak clearly, and the lame could walk. ||77||
There was neither excessive heat nor excessive cold, nor the division of day and night, and no other inauspicious activities could prevail. ||78||

The earth, adorned with all auspiciousness and vibrant with the rustling of crops, joyfully massaged the feet of the Lord with her lotus-like hands. ||39||

The sky, adorned with a garland of blooming lotuses, brought forth the beauty of the ever-flowing lakes, as it was touched by the rays of the sun, the feet of the Jina. ||80||

All the seasons, as if seen by the Lord of Equal Vision, were united in their growth, without any distinction. Truly, the essence of mastery lies in being free from discrimination. ||81||

The earth, known as "Ratnasur" (Jewel-bearing), was overflowing with treasures, wealth, food, mines, and nectar. ||82||

Yama, whose power was defeated by the might of the Lord, the conqueror of death, did not desire to seize anyone's life untimely in the world ruled by the Dharmachakra. (Meaning: Where the Dharmachakra of the Lord prevails, no one dies untimely.) ||83||

Time (Yama) was the servant of the Lord, and out of fear of going against His will, he abandoned his own inconsistencies and followed the Lord's wishes. (Meaning: Time, with its variations of cold, heat, day, and night, was always consistent, following the Lord's will.) ||84||

All the stationary and mobile beings in the Lord's dwelling place were experiencing happiness. This is the true nature of the world, to be a source of benefit for all. ||85||

All beings, including snakes, scorpions, and others, who were naturally hostile by birth, were united in unwavering friendship through the Lord's command. ||86||

How could the wind, carrying the fragrance of the Lord, ever attain it? Thus, the Lord taught the living beings the lesson of service, while remaining peaceful and serving Him. (Meaning: The cool, fragrant wind was serving the Lord, as if teaching the living beings the art of service.) ||87||

The daughters of the directions, adorned with the brilliance of pure light, which emerged from the disappearance of the darkness of dust, worshipped the Lord of the directions with offerings of flowers. ||88||

Salutations to the Harivaṃśapurāṇa, which is as pure as the most luminous and clear stars, and as beautiful as a lake in the autumn season, filled with white lotuses. || 8 || Even the most ignorant of beings, from afar, bow down to Him. What to speak of others? He, the four-faced one, is present in all four directions, devoid of shadow. || 10 || It is indeed true that the Lord Nemi Jinendra is free from all kinds of afflictions, including food. Oh, what a great and wondrous power the Lord of the world possesses! || 11 || It is indeed true that even those who are arrogant and boastful, who are destined for good fortune, bow down to Him. For, such a being, who is free from duality, is truly awe-inspiring in his final state. || 12 || In whichever direction the Lord, accompanied by Indra, goes, the guardians of that direction, with their offerings, come forth to welcome Him. || 13 || The guardians of the directions, with auspicious offerings, follow Him wherever He goes. For, He is the universal sovereign. || 9 || The Ganga, following its three paths, flows, but the army of the gods, without any fixed path, flows in many directions. Thus, that army, influenced by the supremely pure Lord, purifies the earth. || 95 || In the midst of that army of gods, there was a very tall, radiant staff, resembling a staff, which extended from the lower to the upper realms, and was adorned with returning rays. || 96 || The radiance of that staff was threefold, and it appeared very large due to its own brilliance. It eclipsed all other celestial bodies except the sun. || 97 || The light of that staff extended to the end of the universe, was unobstructed, destroyed dense darkness, and surpassed the light of the sun. || 98 || Within that staff, there was another radiant group, resembling a human form, which was a bearer of light, and appeared like another luminous being. It was adorned with thousands of rays, and was formless. || 99 ||

The sixty-first chapter, the great rise of the Lord, is about the radiance of the serpent-banner. The expanse of the radiant cloud, the radiant body, is adorned with a radiant halo. ||10|| It is seen, a remover of sight, pleasant to see, bringing happiness. The form of merit, the one dwelling within it, is worshipped as a human form. ||101|| The ignorant, born of evil, filled with their own evil, do not see that radiance, the radiance of the Lord, like owls. ||102|| The radiance, like the sun's rays, filling all directions, spreads over the earth like the sun's rays. ||103|| Behind it, for the peace of the world, goes the Lord of the world, the Lord of great radiance, enlightening all beings. ||104|| The path of the Lord's journey, marked by its signs, reveals for a year that the Lord has journeyed here, and the path is adorned with a rain of jewels, like the elephant Airavata adorned with a group of stars. ||105|| Just as the path, etc., is seen in the earth connected with the journey, so also the path, etc., is seen in the sky. This is true, for the wonder of the Lord, born of the greatness of the three worlds, is itself wondrous. ||106|| The dull-witted became sharp-witted, all the violent creatures became powerless, and those who were near the Lord had no sorrow, sweat, pain, or anxiety. ||107|| In the land blessed by the Lord's journey, there were no earthquakes, etc., for two hundred yojanas. Or, for ten times the age, that is, fifty years, there was no disturbance, etc., in that land. The meaning is that in the land where the Lord journeys, there is no disturbance, famine, etc., for fifty years. This should be understood as the great glory of the Lord. ||108|| Thus, the Lord Neminatha, the master of the world, endowed with excellent glory, the giver of enlightenment, journeyed over the earth, enlightening the worthy beings, for the glory of the world. ||109||

Harivamsha Purana
The Jina, while wandering through the various countries of Surastra, Matsya, Lata, the vast Shurasen, Patacchara, Kurujangala, Panchala, Kushagra, Magadha, Anjana, Anga, Vanga, and Kalinga, established the Jain Dharma among the Kshatriya and other castes. ||110-111||
Thereafter, while wandering, the Jina arrived in the country called Malaya and resided in the Sahasramra forest of the city of Bhadrailpur. ||112||
As before, the four types of Devas also created a Samavasarana there, and the Jina, adorned with the Ganadharas, became resplendent in it. ||113||
The king of that city, Paunda, along with the city dwellers, came to the Samavasarana, and with folded hands, he praised and bowed to the Jina, taking a seat on the human platform. ||114||
The six sons of Devaki, who resided with Sudrishti Seth and Alaka Sethani, increasing their joy in their sons, also came to the Samavasarana. ||115||
Each of them had thirty-two wives, who were extremely radiant and surpassed even Indra's Indrani in their beauty and other qualities. ||116||
Those six brothers, possessing immense vigor, descended from their six separate chariots, went to the Samavasarana, bowed to the Jina, praised him, and sat down on the human platform along with the king. ||117||
At that time, the Jina preached to the assembly the Shravaka Dharma, adorned with Samyagdarshana, and the Muni Dharma, which destroys karma. ||118||
Thereafter, having heard the nectar of Dharma from the Jina, those six brothers, who had understood the true nature of reality, became detached from the world, informed their relatives, and at the feet of the Jina, received the initiation that grants the Lakshmi of liberation, becoming free from attachments. ||119-120||
Those princes, who had attained the powers of seed-knowledge, etc., studied the twelve-limbed Shruta-knowledge and performed severe austerities. ||121||
The fasts, etc., of these six Munis, their Dharanas, Paranas, Trikalika Yoga, and their actions of sleeping, sitting, etc., all occurred simultaneously. ||122||
The bodies of those Munis, who were engaged in the highest austerities, became even more radiant than before. ||123||
These six Munis, who served the feet of the Tirthankaras, attained the highest level of internal and external austerities, being mutually comparable and incomparable. ||124||

## The 59th Chapter: The Viharavana of the Bhagavan

**705**

The Tirthankara, having traversed the earth with such great power, arrived at the Urjayanta mountain and adorned it with his Samavasarana. ||125||

Indra and the other gods, Krishna and the Yadavas, and the citizens of Dwaraka, all served the Jina, who shone brightly on the Urjayanta mountain. ||126||

Eleven Ganadharas, led by Varadatta, shone brightly there, their minds immersed in the ocean of knowledge. ||127||

In the Tirthankara's Samavasarana, there were four hundred venerable Purvadharis, one thousand eight hundred teachers, fifteen hundred Avadhijnani, fifteen hundred Kevalajnani, nine hundred Vipulamati, eight hundred Vadi, and eleven hundred Vikriya. ||128-130||

Forty thousand Aryikas, accompanied by Rajimati, one hundred seventy-nine thousand Shravakas, and three hundred thirty-six thousand Shravikas, pure in their Samyagdarshan and observing the Shravaka vows, were present there. ||131-132||

Like a cloud, the Tirthankara, showering the thirsty Bhavyas with the divine nectar of Dharma, quenched their thirst with his divine sound. ||133||

Thus, with the rise of the sun, the Jina, the possessor of infinite auspiciousness, stood on the Urjayanta mountain, a rare peak, and the lotus of wisdom, born in the lake of the world, blossomed, holding the lotus of folded hands. ||134||

Thus ends the 59th chapter of the Harivansha Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which describes the Viharavana of the Bhagavan, a collection of the Arishta-Nemipuraana. ||59||

---------------------------
Sixty-first Chapter

Saluting the Jinesvara, Devaki, with folded hands, asked with humility, "O Bhagavan, today two beautiful Muni couples entered my house and ate three times. O Bhagavan, when the time for Muni's meal is one and they eat only once, why do they enter the same house many times? " [1-3]

"Or, it may be that it was a couple of three Munis, and due to their extreme similarity, I was unable to see them. But it is certain that I developed affection for them as if they were my sons." [4]

Hearing this, the Lord said, "These six Munis are your sons, and you gave birth to them as three couples before Krishna." [5]

"They were protected by Deva from Kansa and raised as sons by Sudrishti Seth and Alaka Sethani in Bhadrailpur." [6]

"Having heard the Dharma, all of them together attained my discipleship, became Munis, and will attain Siddhi in this very birth by destroying their karmas." [7]

"The affection you had for them was due to their being your children, which is right, because love exists for all righteous people, what to say of those who are righteous and your sons?" [8]

Then, Devaki, satisfied, saluted those Muni sons, and Krishna and all the Yadavas, bowing down, praised them. [9]

Then, Satyabhama, the queen of Krishna, saluted the Jinesvara and asked about her previous birth. In response, the Lord, the possessor of divine eyes and Kevala Jnana, spoke of her previous birth in front of the Yadavas and Devas. [10]

Previously, in Bhadrailpur, there lived a Brahmin named Mundashalayan, the son of Marichi Brahmin and Kapila Brahmani, who was skilled in composing poetry and considered himself a scholar. [11]

---------------------------
The 60th Chapter:

707. In the Tirtha of Pushpadanta Jinendra, due to the cessation of Dharma, there was a lack of Bhavyas (souls destined for liberation) in the land of Bharat.  ||12||

A Brahmin, afflicted by worldly desires, initiated the practice of giving away cows, daughters, gold, and other things, which were the cause of bondage to sin. ||13||

He deluded the ignorant people and spread his influence even to the kings.  Thus, he became involved in sinful activities and ultimately went to the seventh hell. ||14||

After being released from hell, he wandered through the realms of animals and hell beings.  By chance, he obtained a human birth. ||15||

On the banks of the Gandhavati river, on the Gandhamadana mountain, he was born as a Bhil named Parvatak, the husband of a woman named Vallari. ||16||

Two Charanas (ascetics) named Shridhar and Dharma, possessing great spiritual powers, came to that mountain.  Seeing them, Parvatak felt some peace and was instructed by them to observe a fast.  He died a righteous death. ||17||

In the city of Alka, on the mountain of Parvat, a son named Harivahan was born to a Vidyadhara named Mahabal, in the family of a Vidyadhara named Jyotir-mala, as the brother of Shatabali. ||18||

King Mahabal appointed both his sons, Shatabali and Harivahan, to royal duties.  He himself took initiation from the Guru Shridhar and attained the supreme bliss of liberation, which is the main fruit of initiation. ||19||

Due to some conflict between Shatabali and Harivahan, the elder brother Shatabali banished him.  The exiled Harivahan resided on the Ambudavarta mountain in the land of Magali. ||20||

At that time, two Charanas named Shridhar and Anantavirya, possessing great spiritual powers, came there.  Seeing them, Harivahan took initiation and ultimately attained the Aishana heaven by performing Sallekhana (voluntary death). ||21||

As a Deva (god), he enjoyed the pleasures of the Devas, but due to the karmic consequences of his past actions, he fell from that realm.  He was born as a daughter named Satyabhama to Queen Swayamprabha and King Suketu. ||22||

In this birth, you will perform austerities and become a great Deva.  After falling from that realm, you will perform austerities as prescribed by the Jinas and attain the bliss of liberation. ||23||

Hearing her past lives and knowing that liberation was near, Satyabhama rejoiced and bowed down to the Lord. ||24||

Then Rukmini asked the omniscient Harivaṃśapurāṇa about her previous births. He said, "In this world, there was a being who was devoted to the principle of non-violence.  ||25||
In the Magadha region of the Bharata Kṣetra, there was a village called Lakṣmī. In that village, there lived a Brāhmaṇa named Somadev. He had a wife named Lakṣmīmātī, who was beautiful like Lakṣmī herself, but she was foolish due to her pride in her beauty and did not respect the worthy. ||26-27||
One day, Lakṣmīmātī was adorned with ornaments, her eyes were captivating, and she was looking at her reflection in a mirror made of gems, which was as bright as the moon. At that time, a Muni named Samādhiguṇpta, who was extremely thin due to his austerities, came there for alms. Seeing him, she became envious and criticized him. ||28-29||
Due to the great sin of criticizing a Muni, she was afflicted with a kind of leprosy called Udumbarakuṣṭha within seven days. She suffered so much that she entered the fire and died. ||30||
After her death, she became a donkey and was burdened with salt. Due to the burden, she died and was reborn as a sow in the city of Rājagṛha due to the fault of pride. ||31||
She was killed by hunters and was reborn as a dog in a cow-pen. One day, a terrible fire broke out in the cow-pen, and she was burnt to ashes in that fire. ||32||
She was reborn as a daughter named Pūtigandhikā of a fisherman named Tripada, who lived in the village of Maṇḍaka. ||33||
Her mother abandoned her due to her own sins, and her grandfather raised her. One day, Samādhiguṇpta Muni came to their garden and sat under a banyan tree. Seeing the cold of the night, Pūtigandhikā covered the Muni with a net. ||34||
The Muni had the eyes of knowledge, so he saw her condition and felt compassion. He explained to her and told her about her previous births, and she accepted the Dharma. ||35||
Once, Pūtigandhikā went to the city of Sopārka. There, she worshipped the Āryikās and performed the Ācāmlā penance with them. ||36||

Page #747:

## Chapter Sixty

709

Here, having worshipped the venerable Siddhashila, she remained there and, having performed Sallekhana in the Neelaguha, she died. ||37||

She became the extremely beloved Mahadevi named Gaganavallabha of Achyutendra in the sixteenth heaven. There, in the sixteenth heaven, the excellent state of women is the fifty-five palya, and she was the holder of that excellent state. ||38||

From there, she descended and became the daughter of the noble queen of King Bhishma in the city of Kundinapur, named Rukmini, the sister of Rukmi. ||39||

Having performed the initiation in this excellent existence, you will become an excellent deva, and having fallen from there, you will attain liberation by performing the nirgrantha tapas. ||40||

Having heard of her previous existence, Rukmini became fearful of the terrible samsara, and knowing that liberation was near for her, she bowed to the Lord with great joy. ||41||

Then, Jambavati, the third queen of Krishna, asked Sri Nemijina about her previous existence. In the presence of all beings who were afraid of samsara, he told her about her previous existence as follows. ||42||

In the Pushkalavati country of Jambudvipa, there was a city called Vitashoka. In it, there lived a householder named Devila. He had a daughter named Yashasvini, born to his wife, Devamati. ||43||

Yashasvini was the daughter of the Grihapati (Gahoi) and was given to the son of the Grihapati (Gahoi), named Sumit. But she was very sad when her husband died. ||44||

A certain Jinadeva, who preached the Jina dharma, comforted her with his teachings, but due to the rise of delusion, she did not attain right faith. ||45||

She practiced the worldly practices of charity and fasting, and due to their influence, she died and became the wife of Merunandana, a Vyantara deva in the Nandana forest. ||46||

She enjoyed the pleasures there for thirty thousand and eighty years, and for a long time, she wandered in samsara. ||47||

Then, in the same Jambudvipa, in the Airavata region, in the city of Vijayapur, she was born as the daughter of Bandhumati, the wife of King Bandhushena. She was named Bandhuyasha. In her childhood, she performed the Proshdhavrata initiated by the Jinadeva in the form of Srimata, and therefore, she died and became the wife of Kubera, named Swayamprabha. At the end of her life, she fell from there...

710
In the Harivamsha Purana, in the city of Vajramushti, Subhadra had a daughter named Sumati. She performed the Ratnavala Tapa, inspired by the Aryika Sundarya. As a result, after death, she became the chief queen of the Brahma Indra, who lived for thirteen Palyas. From there, she fell down and was born in the Bharat Kshetra, on the southern slope of the Vijayardha mountain. In the city of Jambav, ruled by the celestial king Jambav, she was born as the daughter of Jambavati, the beloved wife of Jambav. 

She will become a tapaswini in this life, perform austerities, and become a supreme deity in heaven. After falling from there, she will be born as a prince and attain liberation through tapas. 

Hearing this from the Lord, Jambavati, whose doubts were dispelled and who was adorned with the ornament of good conduct, bowed to the Jina and sat down, thinking, "I have crossed over the world." 

The fourth queen, Sushil, asked the Jina about her past lives with humility. The Jina, with a divine voice that brought joy to the hearts of the assembly, described her past lives as follows:

In the eastern half of the Dhataki Khanda, east of Mount Meru, in the Videha region, there was a country called Mangalavati. In its city of Ratnasamchaya, there lived a king named Vishvasena. His wife's name was Anundhari. This king had a famous minister named Sumati, who was a follower of the Shravaka Dharma. 

Once, the king of Ayodhya, Padma Sena, killed King Vishvasena in battle. His wife, Anundhari, was very distressed. The minister Sumati gave her religious advice, but due to her attachment, she could not attain right faith. In the end, she died and became a Vyantari named Jwalanavega, who resided at the Vijayadwar of the Vyantara Deva named Vijay. 

She enjoyed happiness there for ten thousand years, then fell down and wandered in the terrible ocean of samsara for a long time. 

Later, in the Videha region of Jambudvipa, on the southern bank of the Sita River, there is a beautiful region called Ramya. In its prosperous city of Shaligram, there lived a householder named Yakshil. His wife's name was Devaseena.

The Sixtieth Chapter
711

The daughter of the house of Yakshil, Yakshdevi, was born to Devaseena. She was named after the Yaksha deity she was obtained through Yaksha worship. ||63||

She went to the Yaksha house to worship, and there she heard the Dharma from Dharmaseena, her guru, with great reverence. ||64||

She gave food and alms to the guru, and she also gave gifts to other guests. The devoted daughter thus bound herself to the path of virtue. ||65||

One day, she went to play with her friends on the Vimala mountain. There, she was caught in a sudden downpour and took shelter in a cave. ||66||

There, she was terrified by a lion and devoured. She left her body and became a Harivarsha being, with two palyas of lifespan. ||67||

From there, she went to the Jyotirloka, where she was a deity with one palya of lifespan. Then, she fell from there and was born in the Pushkalavati country of the Jambudvipa, in the Bharat Kshetra, as the daughter of the king Ashoka, of the city of Vitashoka. Her name was Shrikant. ||68-69||

As a young girl, she took initiation from the Jinadatta Aryika and performed the Ratnavala tapas. As a result, she became the beloved of the Indra of the Mahendra heaven, with eleven palyas of lifespan. After enjoying the pleasures of heaven, she fell from there and was born as the eldest daughter of the king Rashtravardhana, in the city of Sujyeshta, in the Surashtr country. Now, you will become a deity through the power of tapas, and then you will attain liberation after experiencing the human existence. ||70-72||

Hearing this account of her past lives and knowing that her worldly existence was very near, Susima was very happy and bowed to the liberated Nemijina, who had fulfilled his purpose. ||73||

Then, she bowed to Lakshmana, the fifth queen, and asked the Lord about her past lives. The Lord began to tell her about her past lives. Because all the Tirthankaras are knowledgeable and answer questions, they are called the benefactors of all. ||74||

He said, "In this Jambudvipa, on the northern bank of the Sita river, there is a country called Kachchakavati. In its city of Arishtpur, there once lived a king named Vasava, who was like Indra himself. His beloved was named Sumitra. One day, she went with her beloved to the Sahasramra forest, where the guru Sagaraseena resided." ||75||

Page #750:
---------------------------
712
Having heard the Dharma from the Guru, the king, relinquishing his worldly attachments, abdicated his kingdom and became a monk. He initiated his son Vasusen, but his wife, Sumitra, could not renounce due to her attachment to her son. ||7||
Overwhelmed by the intense grief of losing her husband and son, she died and was reborn as a Pulinda. Seeing the Charana, Nandimadra, who possessed the knowledge of past lives, she remembered her past lives and fasted for three days. ||7||
She was reborn as a celestial being named Meghamalini, the wife of Narada. From there, she was reborn on the southern bank of the Bharata region, in the city of Chandanpur, as the daughter of King Mahendra, a beautiful woman named Kanakmala, who captivated the hearts of the Vidyadharas. ||8||
In her Swayamvara, she chose Harivahana, the king of Vidyadharas in Mahendra Nagar, and became his beloved wife. ||82||
Once, she went to Siddhakut to worship the Jina images. There, she heard about her past lives from a Charana Muni, who possessed the knowledge of past lives, and became an Aryika. She performed the austerities of Muktavali and became the beloved of Sanatkumara, the Indra of the celestial realm. She lived there for nine Palyas, enjoying great happiness. After her death, she was reborn as the daughter of King Shlakshna Roma, the queen Kurumati, named Lakshmana. She was told that she would attain liberation in her third birth. Hearing this, Lakshmana bowed down to the Lord. ||83-85||
Later, when Gandhari, the sixth queen of Krishna, asked about her past lives, the Lord revealed them. He said that in the city of Ayodhya, in the Kosala region, there was once a king named Rudradutta. His queen was named Vinayashri. Once, she and her husband went to the forest of Siddharthaka and offered food to the Muni, Shridhara. ||86-87||
Due to the merit of this offering, after her death, she was reborn as an Arya in Uttarakuru, living for three Palyas. Then, she was reborn as the beloved of the moon, living for one-eighth of a Palyas. ||88||
Then, in the same Vijayardha, in the northern series, she was reborn as:
1. Shavari
2. Charana Muni
3. After death, she fasted for three days.
4. She became a...

## The Most Excellent Birth

Then, in the city of Gaganavallabha, the daughter of Vidyunvega, named Vidyumati, gave birth to a daughter named Vinayashri, who was a great light.  She was renowned for her virtues of humility and was the wife of Mahendravikrama, the king of Nitya-loka.  

Having heard the Dharma from the Charanas and Shramanas, Mahendravikrama renounced the world and appointed his son, Nandana Harivahana, to the kingdom.  Vinayashri, too, renounced the world and performed the Sarvabhadra fast, and through its power, she became the wife of Saudharmendra, the holder of the five-fold state of existence.

She was born as Gandhari, the daughter of Merumati, the queen of Indragiri, the king of Gandhara, in the city of Pushkalavati.  

"You will attain liberation in your third birth," said the omniscient Nemijinenadra, the son of the great sage, to Gandhari.  She bowed to him and then, bowing to Gauri, the seventh wife of Krishna, she asked about her previous births.  The omniscient one, knowing all things, told her about her past lives.

In the city of Ibyapura, in this Bharat Kshetra, there lived a wealthy merchant named Dhandeva.  He had a wife named Yashasvini.  One day, Yashasvini was standing on the roof of her palace when she saw two Charana monks, endowed with supernatural powers, flying through the sky.

Seeing them, she remembered all her past births.  She realized that she had been the wife of Anand, a wealthy merchant, in the city of Nandashoka, in the Videha Kshetra, located in the western part of the eastern Meru, in the Dhataki-khanda island.  There, she and her husband had given food to the sage Mitasagara, and as a result, she had received the five wonders performed by the gods.  Once, they had drunk rainwater that had fallen from the sky, but it was poisoned, and they both died.

After death, she became an Arya in Devakuru, then the beloved of Aishaneindra, and then she was born as Yashasvini here.  Knowing this, Yashasvini, filled with fear of the world, bowed to the sage Subhadra and took the vow of Proshadhavrat.  After death, she became the queen of Indra, the king of the first heaven, who holds the five-fold state of existence.

Page #752:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, 
 
 Dharmamati, a daughter born to Sumitra, wife of the merchant Subhadra in Kaushambi, was always devoted to Dharma. || 101 || 
 
 Dharmamati, having received the tapas named Jinaguna from the Jina-mati, observed a fast and as a result, became the beloved of the Indra of the Mahashukra heaven. || 102 || 
 
 After living for twenty-one palyas, she was reborn as Gauri, the daughter of Chandra-mati, the wife of King Meruchandra in the city of Vitashoka. || 103 || 
 
 "You will attain liberation in three bhava," having been told this, Gauri bowed down to the Lord. Then, Padmavati, the eighth queen of Krishna, also asked about her previous birth. In response, the Lord told her about her previous birth as follows: || 104 || 
 
 In the city of Ujjayini in this Bharat Kshetra, there once lived a king named Aparajita. His wife was Vijaya, and they had a daughter named Vinayashri. || 105 || 
 
 Vinayashri was married to King Harishena of Hastinapur. One day, she, along with her husband, gave food to the Muni-raja Varadatta. || 106 || 
 
 Once, while she was sleeping with her husband in the inner chamber, she died due to the smoke of the Kala-guru. After death, she became an Arya with a lifespan of one paly in the Haimvata region. After enjoying the pleasures there, she was reborn as Chandra-prabha, the wife of Chandradeva. There, her lifespan was one-eighth of a paly. From there, she was reborn as Padma-devi, the daughter of the couple Devila and Jayadeva, in the village of Salmali-khanda in the Magadha country of the Bharat Kshetra. || 107 - 109 || 
 
 Once, she took a vow from the Acharya named Vardharma that she would not eat any unknown fruit for the rest of her life. || 110 || 
 
 One day, a powerful Bhil named Chandabana, who was known for his cruelty, attacked the village of Salmali-khanda and abducted all the people there. || 111 || 
 
 He also captured Padma-devi and took her to his prison. He wanted to make her his wife, but the virtuous Padma-devi, through some strategy, rejected him. || 112 || 
 
 At that time, the king of Rajagriha, Simharatha, killed Chandabana in the forest. The people were relieved. || 113 ||

Page #753:

## The Confirmed Birth

The people there, afflicted by hunger, were bewildered and foolish. Like deer, they wandered aimlessly, consumed by sorrow, eating *kipaak* fruits. || 114 || 

Padmadevi, steadfast in her vow, refused to eat those unknown fruits. She renounced the world and ultimately became a *palyaka* in the region of Himavat. || 115 || 

From there, she became the *Vyantara* deity named *Svayam Prabha* on the mountain *Svayam Prabha* in the *Svayam Bhur Aman* island. || 116 || 

Then, coming from there, she was born as the daughter of *Srimat* the queen of *Jayanta Nagar*, the ruler of the Bharat region, to *Sri Dhar*. || 117 || 

She was given to *Megha Nad*, the king of *Madrilpur*. Through their union, she gave birth to a son renowned as *Megha Ghosh* on earth. || 118 || 

After her husband's passing, she took initiation near *Padmavati Arthik* and performed the *Achaml Vardhan* penance, through which she ascended to heaven. || 119 || 

In heaven, she became the chief consort of the Indra of the *Sahasrar* heaven and spent forty-five *palyas* there. || 120 || 

Now, having descended from there, she was born as the daughter of *Srimat*, the queen of *Arishtapur*, to *Swarna Nabha*, named *Padmavati*. || 121 || 

"You will become a deity in heaven through penance and then, through the power of that penance, you will attain liberation." Hearing this, *Padmavati* bowed to *Jina*. || 122 || 

*Rohini*, *Devaki*, and other *Devis* and *Yadavs* also inquired about their past lives and, upon hearing them, became fearful of the world. || 123 || 

Thus, the *Suras*, *Asuras*, and *Yadavs* praised and bowed to *Jinendra* and then went to their respective places, returning again and again for worship. || 124 || 

Then, *Jinendra* wandered through many lands for the benefit of noble beings. Just as the sun's journey is for the benefit of the world, so too was his. || 125 || 

Meanwhile, *Devaki* gave birth to another son named *Gaj Kumar*, who was as radiant as *Vasudeva*, beloved by *Krishna*, and very auspicious. || 126 ||

In the Harivamsha Purana, when Gajkumar attained the age of youth, which was pleasing to the women, Krishna arranged his marriage with the most excellent princesses. ||127|| Soma, a very beautiful daughter born to a Kshatriya woman from Soma Sharma, a Brahmin, was chosen by Hari for Gajkumar. ||128||
When the time for his marriage arrived, all the Yadavas were very happy, and at that time, Lord Nemnath was wandering in Dwaraka. ||129||
When the Lord arrived and resided on Mount Girnar, all the Yadavas, carrying many auspicious things, went out of the city to worship him. ||130||
Seeing this commotion in Dwaraka, Gajkumar asked a Jain monk and from the beginning, he understood all the beneficial actions of the Jina. ||131||
Then, Gajkumar, riding in a chariot as bright as the sun, with his body trembling with joy, went to worship the Jina. ||132||
After bowing to the Arhant, who was endowed with wealth and surrounded by ten assemblies, Gajkumar sat down with Krishna in the assembly of humans. ||133||
In that assembly of humans, gods, and demons, Lord Nemnath Jina explained the Dharma, which was the only way to cross the ocean of existence and which was illuminated by the three jewels of Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct. ||134||
On that occasion, Krishna, with a heart full of respect and a desire for the benefit of the listeners, bowed to the Jina and asked about the origin of the Tirthankaras, Chakravartis, Ardha Chakravartis, Balabhadra, and Prati-Narayana, as well as the intervals between the Tirthankaras. ||135-136||
Then, according to the question, the Lord began to speak about the origin of the twenty-four Tirthankaras, who were the most important among the sixty-three Shalaka Purushas. ||137||
He said that in this Yuga, the first Tirthankara was Rishabhanatha. After him, in order, were Ajitanatha, Sambhavanatha, Abhinandanatha, Sumatinatha, Padma Prabha, Supaashvanatha, Chandra Prabha, Suvidhinatha, Sheetalnath, Shreyonath,

**Note:** The text mentions that the Tirthankaras attained Kevala Jnana in their respective gardens in their cities. This indicates that the attainment of Kevala Jnana was not a solitary event, but rather a public one, witnessed by the people of their cities. This also highlights the importance of the Tirthankaras as spiritual leaders and guides for their followers.

## The Sixtieth Chapter

Mallinath attained liberation with 500 munis, Shanti Nath with 900, Dharmanath with 801, Vasupujya with 601, Vimala Nath with 6000, Anantnath with 7000, Supaashva Nath with 500, Padma Prabh with 3800, and Vrishabhanath with 10,000. The remaining Tirthankaras attained liberation with 1000 munis each. || 283 - 285 ||

Bharat, Sagar, Mahaveer, Sanatkumar, Shanti Nath, Kunth Nath, Aranath, Subhoom, Mahapadma, Harishen, Jay, and Brahmadatt were the twelve Chakravartis who ruled over six continents. || 286 - 287 ||

Triprishth, Dwiprishth, Swayambhu, Purushottam, Purush Singh, Purush Pundarik, (Pundarik) Datt, Narayan (Lakshman), and Krishna are the nine Vasudevas. They are the rulers of three continents and their valor is never broken by others. || 288 - 289 ||

Vijay, Achal, Sudham, Suprabh, Sudarshan, Nandi, Nandimitra, Ram, and Padma are the nine Balabhadra. || 290 ||

Ashvagriva, famous in the world, Tarak, Meruk, Nishumbh, Madhukaitabh with a face like a blooming lotus, Bali, Praharan, Ravana of the celestial lineage, and Jarasandh, the earth-dweller, are the nine Pratinarayan. || 291 - 292 ||

Balabhadra are upward-going - towards heaven or liberation - and do not bind any nidana in the future life. Narayan are downward-going and bind nidana in the future life. || 293 ||

Chakravarti Bharat was during the time of Vrishabhanath, Chakravarti Sagar was during the time of Ajitnath, Mahaveer and Sanatkumar were during the time between Dharmanath and Shanti Nath. Shanti, Kunth, and Aranath Chakravartis had their own separate time periods. Subhoom Chakravarti was during the time between Aranath and Mallinath. Mahapadma was during the time between Mallinath and Munisuvratnath. Harishen was during the time between Munisuvratnath and

Page #766:
---------------------------
In the Harivansh Purana, it is stated that eight of the Balabhadra attained liberation, while Brahmadatt and Subhumi went to the seventh earth, and Maghava and Sanatkumar attained the third heaven. ||297||

From Shreyansanath to Dharmanath, five Narayana, starting from Triprutha and ending with Purushasimha, witnessed the period between these five Tirthankaras along with the Balabhadra. In other words, five Narayana, starting from Triprutha, and five Balabhadra, starting from Vijay, existed during the period between Shreyansanath and Dharmanath.  

The Narayana named Datt existed between the Tirthankaras Pundarika, Aranath, and Mallinath. The Narayana named Mallinath existed between Mallinath and Munisuvratnath. The Narayana named Lakshmana existed between Munisuvratnath and Naminath. Krishna, who is present in this era, worshipped Naminath along with Padma. ||298-301||

Among these Narayana, the first Narayana, Triprutha, went to the seventh earth. The second to the sixth Narayana went to the sixth earth. The seventh Narayana went to the fifth earth, and the eighth and ninth Narayana will go to the third earth. ||302||

The first eight Balabhadra attained liberation through the power of their penance, and the last Balabhadra will go to the fifth Brahma heaven. He will come back from there and attain liberation in the Tirtha of Krishna when Krishna becomes a Tirthankara. ||303||

The height of Rishabhdev was 500 dhanus. The height of the next eight Tirthankaras decreased by 50 dhanus each. After that, the height of the Tirthankaras decreased by 10 dhanus each. Then, the height of the next eight Tirthankaras decreased by 5 dhanus each. ||304||

The height of Parshvanath was 9 hands, and the height of Mahavira was 7 hands. In this way, one should know the height of the Tirthankaras. ||305||

The Harivamsha Purana states:

**Lifespans of the Balabhadra:**

* Seventy-seven lakhs, seventy lakhs, sixty-six lakhs, thirty-five lakhs, ten lakhs, sixty thousand, thirty thousand, seventeen thousand, and twelve hundred years are the lifespans of the Balabhadra, respectively.

**Arrangement of Tirthankaras, Chakravartis, and Narayanas:**

* To understand the order of Tirthankaras, Chakravartis, and Narayanas, a device with thirty-four compartments should be created.
* Two more devices with thirty-four compartments each should be placed below it.
* The top device should contain the Tirthankaras, the middle device the Chakravartis, and the bottom device the Narayanas.
* The number one should be used for Tirthankaras, two for Chakravartis, and three for Narayanas in the device.
* In the top device, the fifteen Tirthankaras from Rishabhanatha to Dharmanatha should be arranged sequentially, i.e., one should be written in each of the first fifteen compartments.
* After that, two zeros, then one Tirthankara, then two zeros, then one Tirthankara, then two zeros, then one Tirthankara, then two zeros, then one Tirthankara, then one zero, and then two Tirthankaras consecutively should be arranged.
* Subsequently, in the bottom device, Bharat and the other two Chakravartis, then thirteen zeros, then six Chakravartis, then three zeros, then one Chakravarti, then one zero, then one Chakravarti, then two zeros, then one Chakravarti, then three zeros, then one Chakravarti, and then two zeros should be arranged sequentially.
* Subsequently, in the bottom device, ten zeros should be placed at the beginning, then five Narayanas like Tripruṣṭa, then six zeros, then one Narayana, then one zero, then one Narayana, then three zeros, then one Narayana, then two zeros, then one Narayana, and then three zeros should be arranged sequentially.

**Explanation:**

* Bharat Chakravarti was present before Rishabhanatha, Sagar Chakravarti before Ajiteshwar, and the two Chakravartis, Maghava and Sanatkumara, were present between Dharmanatha and Shantinatha.

**Note:**

* This section appears to be taken from the fourth Mahaadhikaran of the Tiloyashnattika. The verses in that section are as follows:

> Rishabhasaras Bharata, Sagara Ajitasaras Pacchakkham. Maghava Sanatkumara, two Chakravartis, Dharma Shanti Vicchala.
> Ah Shanti Kuntha, Ar Jin Tithayara Te Cha Chakravattitte. Ekko Subhauma Chakravi Ar Malli Nantara Yammi.

Sixty-first Chapter

"The Kumarakāla of the lifespan of Vṛṣabha is one-fourth. The remaining after subtracting the time of restraint is the time of the kingdom. ||330||

Kunthu and Ara were the three who became Tirthankaras and Cakravartins themselves. Subhauma Cakravartin was in the interval of Aranāth and Mallināth, Padma Cakravartin was in the interval of Malli and Muniśuvrata, Hariṣeṇa Cakravartin was in the interval of Suvrata and Namināth, Jayasena Cakravartin was in the interval of Namināth and Nemināth, and Brahmadutta Cakravartin was in the interval of Nemināth and Pārśvanāth. Here, the Cakravartins who were not in front of the Tirthankaras but in the interval have been marked with zero in the brackets of the Tirthankaras, and those who were in front of the Tirthankaras have been marked with one in the brackets of the Tirthankaras. Below the Tirthankaras in front of whom the Cakravartins were, the number two has been written in the brackets of the Cakravartins, and below those in front of whom there was no Cakravartin, zero has been written. Similarly, one should know about the Nārāyaṇas, that is, from the first to the tenth Tirthankara, there was no Nārāyaṇa, after that, from the eleventh to the fifteenth, there were five Nārāyaṇas. Thereafter, in the interval of Ara and Mallināth, in the interval of Malli and Muniśuvrata, in the interval of Suvrata and Nami, and in the time of Nemināth, there were Nārāyaṇas. Where there is no Nārāyaṇa, zero has been written in the brackets, and where there is a presence, the number three has been written. ||319 - 329||

The lifespan of Bhagavān Vṛṣabhadev was eighty-four lakhs of Pūrvas. One-fourth of it, that is, twenty lakhs of Pūrvas, was the Kumarakāla. The remaining after subtracting the time of restraint was the time of the kingdom. Meaning - Bhagavān Vṛṣabhadev spent twenty lakhs of Pūrvas in Kumarakāla, sixty-four lakhs of Pūrvas in the kingdom, one thousand years in penance, and one thousand years less one lakh of Pūrvas in Kevalīkāla. ||330||

The complete lifespan of the Tirthankaras from Aristhanatha to the eighteenth Tirthankara, Arinatha, was divided into four parts. One part was the Kumarakala, and the remaining three parts were the time spent in the kingdom and in Samaya. [The Kumarakala of the last six Tirthankaras was 100 years, 7500 years, 2500 years, 300 years, 30 years, and 30 years respectively]. ||331|| Vasupujya, Mallinatha, Neminatha, Parsvanatha, and Mahavira were the five Tirthankaras who were child-celibates. Therefore, the time spent in Samaya is subtracted from their lifespan, and the remaining time is called Kumarakala. ||332||
The Samaya of Shri Rishabhanatha Bhagwan was one lakh Purvas. The Samaya of Ajitanatha was one lakh Purvas minus one Purvang, the Samaya of Sumatinatha was one lakh Purvas minus twelve Purvangs, the Samaya of Abhinandanatha was one lakh Purvas minus eight Purvangs, the Samaya of Sumatinatha was one lakh Purvas minus twelve Purvangs, the Samaya of Padma Prabha was one lakh Purvas minus sixteen Purvangs, the Samaya of Suparshvanatha was one lakh Purvas minus twenty Purvangs, the Samaya of Chandra Prabha was one lakh Purvas minus twenty-four Purvangs, the Samaya of Pushpadanta was one lakh Purvas minus twenty-eight Purvangs, the Samaya of Vasupujya was three-fourths of his complete lifespan (forty-two lakh years), the Samaya of Mallinatha was one hundred years less than his complete lifespan (fifty-five thousand years minus one hundred years), the Samaya of Neminatha was three hundred years less than his complete lifespan (seven hundred years), the Samaya of Parsvanatha was thirty years less than his complete lifespan (seventy years), the Samaya of Mahavira was thirty years less than his complete lifespan (forty-two years), and the Samaya of the remaining ten Tirthankaras was one-fourth of their lifespan. The Samaya of all the Tirthankaras is of two types: Chhadmastha Kala and Kevalikala. ||333-336|| The Chhadmastha Kala of Rishabhanatha was one thousand years, the Chhadmastha Kala of Ajitanatha was twelve years, the Chhadmastha Kala of Sambhavanatha was fourteen years, the Chhadmastha Kala of Abhinandanatha was eighteen years, the Chhadmastha Kala of Sumatinatha was twenty years, the Chhadmastha Kala of Padma Prabha was six months, the Chhadmastha Kala of Suparshvanatha was nine years, the Chhadmastha Kala of Chandra Prabha was three months, the Chhadmastha Kala of Pushpadanta was four months, the Chhadmastha Kala of Shitalnatha was three months, the Chhadmastha Kala of Shreyansnatha was two months, and the Chhadmastha Kala of Vasupujya was one month.
1. Kumarakala: The remaining part of the lifespan. * This is a translation of Tiloayapannatti, Chapter 4, verse 584. +. The Chhadmastha Kala of Pushpadanta to Dharmanatha is mentioned here as 4, 3, etc. months, but in Tiloayapannatti, it is mentioned as 4, 3, etc. years. The verses of Tiloayapannatti are as follows:
Ushaadi Suvasa Sahasra Baras Chauddhasattarasa. Bos Chhadumatthakalo Chhachchiya Paumppahhe Masa. ||675|| Vasani Nav Supase Masa Chandapphahhammi Tini Tado. Chadu Tidu Ekkka Tidu Igi Solas Chauvagg Chaukdi Vasa. ||676|| Mallijine Chhaddivasa Ekkaras Suyade Jine Masa.

In the Tirthankara Ajitanatha's tirtha, Ajitanabha was a Rudra, in the Tirthankara Shantinatha's tirtha, Peetha was a Rudra, and in the Tirthankara Mahavira's tirtha, Satyakiputra will be a Rudra. ||534-536||
The height of Bhimavali's body was 500 dhanus, Jitashatru's was 450 dhanus, Rudra's was 100 dhanus, Vishvanala's was 90 dhanus, Supratisthaka's was 80 dhanus, Achala's was 70 dhanus, Pundarika's was 60 dhanus, Ajitanadhara's was 50 dhanus, Ajitanabhika's was 28 dhanus, Peetha's was 24 dhanus, and Satyakiputra's was 7 dhanus. ||537-538||
The lifespan of these Rudras was 83 lakh years in the past, 71 lakh years in the past, 2 lakh years in the past, 1 lakh years in the past, 84 lakh years, 60 lakh years, 50 lakh years, 40 lakh years, 20 lakh years, 10 lakh years, and 79 years respectively. All these Rudras were followers of the Dashapurva and performed the work of Rudras. ||539-541||
These Rudras have three periods in their lives: 1. Kumarakala, 2. Sanayamakala, and 3. The period of being without restraint after abandoning the restraint of Sanayamakala. ||542||
The period of Sanayamakala for four of them was slightly longer than the rest, meaning it was slightly longer than their Kumarakala and the period of being without restraint. For two of them, all three periods were equal. The seventh one had a longer Kumarakala, the eighth one had a longer period of being without restraint, the ninth one had a longer Kumarakala, and the tenth one had a longer Sanayamakala. The eleventh Rudra will have a Kumarakala of 7 years, a Sanayamakala of 28 years, and a period of being without restraint of 34 years. ||543-545||
The first two Rudras went to the seventh earth, five Rudras went to the sixth earth, one went to the fifth earth, and two went to the fourth earth. The last Rudra will go to the third earth. These Rudras had a heavy burden of being without restraint in their lives. Therefore, they have to go to hell. ||546-547||

## The Sixtieth Chapter

Bhima, Maha-Bhima, Rudra, Maha-Rudra, Kala, Maha-Kala, Chatamankha, Naravaktra and Unmukha. These nine are considered Naradas. Their lifespan is equal to that of the Narayanas and they exist during the time of the Narayanas. They are delighted in conflict, sometimes they are also fond of Dharma, they take pleasure in violence and are followers of the Maha-bhavya and the Jina. ||548-550||

After the liberation of Mahavir, after six hundred and five years and five months, there will be a king named Shakara and after every thousand years, there will be a Kalki king who will be an opponent of Jain Dharma. ||551-552||

Just as there were Tirthankaras and others in this Avasarpini, in the coming Utsarpini, there will be other Tirthankaras and others. ||553||

When there are a thousand years remaining in the coming Dushama period, these fourteen Kulkaras will be in the order: 1. Kanaka, shining like gold, 2. Kanaka-prabha, 3. Kanaka-raja, 4. Kanaka-dhvaja, 5. Kanaka-pungava, 6. Nalina, with the color of a lotus petal, 7. Nalina-prabha, 8. Nalina-raja, 9. Nalina-dhvaja, 10. Nalina-pungava, 11. Padma-prabha, 12. Padma-raja, 13. Padma-dhvaja and 14. Padma-pungava. ||554-557||

After the Kulkaras, the following twenty-four Tirthankaras will be in order: 1. Maha-padma, 2. Suradeva, 3. Supavas, 4. Swayamprabha, 5. Sarvatma-bhuta, 6. Devadeva, 7. Prabhodaya, 8. Udaka, 9. Prasna-koti, 10. Kirti, 11. Suvrata, 12. Ara, 13. Punyamurti, 14. Nishkashaya, 15. Vipula, 16. Nirmala, 17. Chitragupta, 

Regarding the birth of Shakaraja, apart from this opinion, three other opinions are mentioned in the T.P.: (1) After the liberation of Vira Jinendra, after four hundred and sixty-one years, Shakaraja was born. (2) After nine thousand seven hundred and eighty-five years and five months. (3) After fourteen thousand seven hundred and ninety-nine years. The verses are as follows:

Vira-jine Siddhi-gade Chausad Igi Satrivas Parimane.
Kalamma Adikkate Uppanno Ettha Shakarao. ||1496||

Ahva Tire Siddha Sahassanavakkammi Sagasayabbhahiye.
Panasi-dimmi Yati-de Shanamasse Sakaniyo Jado. ||1497||

Chaudas Sahassa Sagasay Tenau-di Vasakala Vicchede.
Viresarasiddido Uppanno Saganiyo Ahva. ||1498||

Niwane Vira-jine Chabbasa Sade-su Panchavarisesu.
Shanamasse-su Gare-su Sanjado Saganiyo Ahva. ||1499||

In the Harivamsha Purana, there are twenty-four future Tirthankaras, starting with Samadhigupta, followed by Swayambhu, Anivartaka, Jaya, Vimala, Divyapada, and Anantavirya. All of them possess virtues like strength, courage, etc. ||561-562||
The twelve future Chakravartis are: Bharata, Dirghadanta, Janmadanta, Gudhadatta, Srishena, Sribhuta, Srikanta, Padmanamaka, Mahapadma, Chitravahana, Vimala Vahana (free from the contact of impurities), and Arishtasena. ||563-565||
The nine future Narayanas are: Nandi, Nandimitra, Nandina, Nandibhutika, Mahabala, Atibala, Balabhadra, Dviprishta, and Triprishta. They will be radiant like collyrium and their radiance will fill the space between the directions. ||566-567||
The nine future Balabhadra are: Chandra, Mahachandra, Chandradhara, Singhchandra, Harichandra, Srichandra, Purnchandra, Suchandra, and Balachandra. All of them will be radiant like the moon. ||568||

Even a single jewel of right faith, obtained for a moment, is the cause of liberation. What to speak of the three jewels, which are the most sacred in the world and directly destroy the delusion of existence? ||573||

**Listen, O kings, with joy, to this divine sound, which describes the essence of the three times and brings happiness to the ears.**  Krishna and other kings, Indra and Surya and other gods, having grasped the true essence of Dharma, bowed to the Jina and went to their respective places. || 5704 ||

**Thus ends the 60th chapter of the Harivamsa Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which is a collection of the Arishta-Nemipuraana, and describes the character of the deceitful dice-players and the intervals between the Tirthankaras.** || 60 ||

## Chapter Sixty-One

Knowing the intention of the Shrenika, the head of the Ganadharas, Shri Gautam Swami, praised by the world, began to narrate the story of the elephant prince. ||1||

He said, "Hearing the story of the Tirthankaras, the elephant prince, filled with fear of the world, left behind all his relatives, including his father and son, and with great humility approached the Jinenadra. He received permission and, eager to perform penance, took the vows. ||2-3||

The girls who were destined for the elephant prince, like Prabhavati, all renounced the world and took the vows. ||4||

One night, the elephant prince, a solitary monk, was seated in meditation, enduring all kinds of obstacles, when Soma Sharma, inflamed by the fire of anger born from the abandonment of his daughter, approached him. With a steady mind, he ignited a fierce fire on the head of the monk. ||5-6||

His body was consumed by the fire. In that state, he destroyed his karma through Shukla Dhyana and, becoming an Antakrit Kevali, attained liberation. ||7||

Yaks, Kinnaras, Gandharvas, and Mahoragas, along with the gods and demons, came together and worshipped his body. ||8||

Many Yadavas, including Samudravijaya, and others, filled with grief at the death of the elephant prince, renounced the world and took the vows, desiring liberation. ||9||

Except for Shiva and other goddesses, Devaki, and Rohini, the other wives of Vasudeva and the daughters of Krishna also took the vows. ||10||

After that, the revered Nemijinenadra, worshipped by gods and humans, travelled through various lands with great splendor, awakening the souls of the people. ||11||

He established many kings in the Dharma, including those from the north, the middle country, and the east, who were all filled with subjects. ||12||

Page #793:
---------------------------
## Chapter Sixty-One

Having spent a long time in wandering, the Lord returned to his former abode, adorning the Samvasarana on Mount Raivatak. ||13|| The Devas, possessing intense radiance, approached the Jina, who was seated there, and having bowed down and paid their respects, they settled in their own places. ||14|| Vasudeva, Balarama, and Krishna, accompanied by their wives, friends, the people of Dwaraka, and their sons, headed by Pradyumna, arrived with great splendor and, having paid their respects to the Lord Nemnath, sat in their designated places in the Samvasarana, listening to the Dharma from the Lord. ||15-16|| 

After the discourse on Dharma, Balarama, with folded hands touching his forehead, asked the Jina, who was seated with a calm mind: ||17|| "O Lord, this city of Dwaraka was built by Vaishravana. How long will it last? For, indeed, all artificial things are perishable." ||18|| "Will this Dwaraka sink into the ocean in due course of time, or will it be destroyed by some other cause due to the presence of some other cause?" ||19|| "Who will be the cause of Krishna's demise at the end of his life? For, the death of all living beings is certain." ||20|| "O Lord, how long will it take for me to attain self-control? My mind is bound by the great fetter of love for Krishna." ||21|| 

Thus questioned, the Jina, who saw all past and future, answered truthfully and according to the question, as it was befitting for him to answer questions. ||22|| He said: "O Rama, this city will be reduced to ashes by Dvaipayana Muni in the twelfth year, due to the cause of wine." ||23|| "At the end of his life, Krishna will be sleeping in the forest of Kaushambi, and Jaratkumara will be the cause of his destruction." ||24|| 

"When the inner cause is present, the outer cause becomes the instrument of destruction or creation in the world, due to the force of destiny." ||25||

Page #794:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, those who know the true nature of things, do not experience joy or sorrow in the world, for they understand that both prosperity and decline are caused by external factors. || 25-26 ||

You too, who are afraid of the cycle of birth and death, will attain liberation through tapasya, which will be brought about by Krishna's death. Through tapasya, you will be born in the Brahma Loka. || 27 ||

Dwaipayana, the son of Vyasa, was the brother of Rohini and the maternal uncle of Balarama. Upon hearing the words of the Jains, he renounced the world and became a monk, devoting himself to tapasya. || 28 ||

To complete the twelve years of his penance, he went to the eastern region and began to practice tapasya, which aimed to dry up his passions and purify his body. || 29 ||

Knowing that Krishna's death would be caused by him, Jaratkumara was filled with sorrow. Leaving behind his grieving brothers and relatives, he went to a place where he would not see Krishna. || 30 ||

When Jaratkumara went into the forest and lived alone, Krishna, overwhelmed with love, felt empty within himself. || 31 ||

Krishna, who loved Jaratkumara as his own life, wandered alone in the desolate forest, like a deer, longing to leave his dear life behind. || 32 ||

Meanwhile, the Yadavas, their hearts filled with anxiety about the impending doom, entered the city after paying their respects to Krishna. || 33 ||

Krishna, along with Balarama, announced in the city that all the materials used for making and consuming alcohol should be discarded immediately. || 34 ||

Upon hearing the announcement, the drinkers, along with the ingredients for making alcohol, such as flour, yeast, etc., and all the alcohol itself, were thrown into the deep caves of the Kadamba mountain, which were filled with stone-lined ponds. || 35 ||

The alcohol that was discarded in the ponds of the Kadamba forest remained there due to the special properties of the stone. || 36 ||

Krishna, with his benevolent intentions, made another announcement in the city of Dwaraka, for all the men and women to hear: "If my father, mother, daughter, or any woman of the inner palace wishes to become a Jain and practice tapasya, I will not stop them. They have my permission to do so." || 37 ||

A Clear Exposition of the Creation:

Then, Pradyumna, Bhanu, and the other Kumaras, the last of their lineage, along with many others, renounced their possessions and went to the forest to practice austerities. ||39|| Rukmini, Satyabhāma, and the other eight chief queens, having received permission from Hari, along with their co-wives, embraced the ascetic life. ||40||  Siddhartha, the charioteer, who was Balarama's brother, was requested by Balarama to guide him if he ever fell into the clutches of worldly desires. Accepting this request, Siddhartha embraced austerities. ||41||
Then, with a great assembly, the Jina, the radiant sun of the lotus of auspiciousness, arrived in the land of Pallava, to enlighten the worthy beings. ||42|| At that time, the multitude of kings, queens, and people who had renounced their worldly attachments, set out with the Jina towards the northern path. ||43||
The people of Dvaravati, having stayed outside the city for twelve years, returned to their homes due to the power of destiny. ||44|| Meanwhile, the people of Dvaravati, fearing the afterlife, were constantly engaged in vows, fasts, and other virtuous acts. ||45||
Then, Dvaipayana, the great sage, who was engaged in intense austerities, also arrived there in the twelfth year, believing that the twelve years had passed.  His mind was confused, and he was weak in right faith, thinking that the Jina's instructions had been fulfilled. ||46-47|| He remained in the path of the sun, practicing the austerities of standing still, near a mountain outside Dvaravati. ||48||
At that time, the Kumaras, Shamba and the others, exhausted from playing in the forest and parched with thirst, drank the wine that was kept in the ponds of the Kadamba forest. ||49|| Having drunk the sweet wine, which was left in the Kadamba forest and was in the form of Kadamba fruits, the Kumaras were overcome by intoxication. ||50||
Complete freedom is attained. ||37-38||
Upon hearing the proclamation, Pradyumna, Bhanu, and the other Kumaras, along with many others, renounced their possessions and went to the forest to practice austerities. ||39|| Rukmini, Satyabhāma, and the other eight chief queens, having received permission from Hari, along with their co-wives, embraced the ascetic life. ||40||  Siddhartha, the charioteer, who was Balarama's brother, was requested by Balarama to guide him if he ever fell into the clutches of worldly desires. Accepting this request, Siddhartha embraced austerities. ||41||
Then, with a great assembly, the Jina, the radiant sun of the lotus of auspiciousness, arrived in the land of Pallava, to enlighten the worthy beings. ||42|| At that time, the multitude of kings, queens, and people who had renounced their worldly attachments, set out with the Jina towards the northern path. ||43||
The people of Dvaravati, having stayed outside the city for twelve years, returned to their homes due to the power of destiny. ||44|| Meanwhile, the people of Dvaravati, fearing the afterlife, were constantly engaged in vows, fasts, and other virtuous acts. ||45||
Then, Dvaipayana, the great sage, who was engaged in intense austerities, also arrived there in the twelfth year, believing that the twelve years had passed.  His mind was confused, and he was weak in right faith, thinking that the Jina's instructions had been fulfilled. ||46-47|| He remained in the path of the sun, practicing the austerities of standing still, near a mountain outside Dvaravati. ||48||
At that time, the Kumaras, Shamba and the others, exhausted from playing in the forest and parched with thirst, drank the wine that was kept in the ponds of the Kadamba forest. ||49|| Having drunk the sweet wine, which was left in the Kadamba forest and was in the form of Kadamba fruits, the Kumaras were overcome by intoxication. ||50||
Complete freedom is attained. ||37-38||

Although the wine was old, it had intoxicated the young men, making them appear like young women with their bright red eyes. ||51||
As a result, the young men sang incoherently, danced with unsteady steps, their hair was disheveled, their ornaments were scattered, and they wore garlands of wild flowers around their necks. ||52||
As they approached the city, they saw the sage Dvaipayana standing before the sun. Recognizing him, their eyes began to spin. They said to each other, "This is the same Dvaipayana, the yogi, who will bring about the destruction of Dwarka. Where will this poor fellow go now, in front of us?" ||53-54||
Having said this, those merciless young men pelted him with stones and clods until he fell to the ground, injured. ||55||
Overwhelmed with anger, the sage bit his lip and furrowed his brow, ready to destroy the Yadavas and his own penance. ||56||
Like intoxicated elephants, the restless young men entered Dwarka. Some of them quickly reported this incident to Krishna. ||57||
Hearing about this incident involving Dvaipayana, Balarama and Narayana understood that the prophecy of the Jina, the destruction of Dwarka, was about to come true. ||58||
Balarama and Narayana, in a state of confusion, abandoned all their belongings and rushed to appease the sage, who was burning with anger like fire, and to seek his forgiveness. ||59||
They saw Dvaipayana, whose mind was filled with anguish, whose face was distorted by a furrowed brow, whose eyes were filled with sorrow, whose breath was caught in his throat, and who was terrifying. They folded their hands and bowed to the sage with great respect. Knowing that their plea would be in vain, they still begged him, driven by their attachment. ||60-61||
They said, "O sage! This burden of penance, which you have protected for so long, whose root is forgiveness, is being consumed by the fire of anger. Please protect it, protect it!" ||62||
This anger can corrupt the penance, which is the means to liberation, in an instant. Anger is the enemy of the four classes (dharma, artha, kama, moksha) and the destroyer of oneself and others. ||63||
Thus it is said. ||50||

Sixty-fourth Chapter

"Forgive us, forgive us, O foolish one, for the many mistakes we have made. May your grace be upon us." ||64||

Thus, being entreated by the beloved ones, the non-retreating one, with a heart full of sin, decided to burn Dwarika along with its inhabitants. ||65||

He showed them both, Balarama and Krishna, two fingers, clearly indicating that only they two could be saved, not anyone else. ||66||

Knowing that his anger would not subside, Balarama and Krishna, realizing the destruction of Dwarika, were filled with sorrow and confusion. They returned to the city. ||67||

At that time, many Yadavas, including Shambhu Kumar, who had renounced the world, left the city and resided in caves and mountains. ||68||

The sage Vyasa, whose storehouse of tapas was burnt by the fire of anger, died and became a god named Agni Kumar, a resident of the realm of false vision. ||69||

Within a moment, he became fully aware of the wrong done to him by the Yadava princes, through the knowledge of the destruction of the world. ||70||

He contemplated this fierce meditation: "Look, I was engaged in my innocent tapas, yet these people harmed me. Therefore, I will burn this entire city of the violent ones, along with all its inhabitants." ||71||

As he meditated thus, the terrible god, the bearer of disastrous consequences, approached. As soon as he arrived, great calamities began to occur in Dwarika, causing fear. ||72-73||

The people in their homes, sleeping peacefully at night, began to have terrifying dreams that made their hair stand on end. ||73||

Finally, that god, filled with sin and anger, reached the city and began to burn it from the outside, a city filled with animals and humans. ||74||

The city was engulfed in smoke and flames. He caught and threw into the fire the old, the women, the children, the animals, and the birds. Where is compassion in a sinner? ||75||

At that time, the cries of all the creatures burning in the fire were such as had never been heard on this earth. ||76||

Page #798:
---------------------------
760
Harivamsha Purana
When the city was being consumed by the divine fire, it was clear that the gods had left. This was inevitable, for the destiny of the universe is unpredictable. ||77|| Otherwise, how could the city, created and protected by Kubera under the command of Indra, be consumed by fire? ||78|| "Oh Balarama and Krishna! We have been suffering from the fear of fire for a long time, protect us!" Such were the words of the women, children, and elders, filled with fear and anxiety. ||79|| Balarama and Krishna, filled with anxiety, broke through the city walls and rushed towards the sea, determined to extinguish the fire. ||80|| Balarama, the strong one, drew water from the sea with his plow, but it turned into oil, making the fire burn even more fiercely. ||81|| Realizing that the fire was insurmountable, they placed their mothers, father, and many others on a chariot, yoked elephants and horses to it, and drove it across the earth. But the chariot wheels sank into the earth like they would in mud. This is inevitable, for in times of calamity, where are elephants and horses of any use? ||82-83|| Seeing the elephants and horses useless, the two brothers pulled the chariot themselves with their arms, but the wicked Indra, using a vajra-like nail, stopped the chariot. ||84|| While Balarama was trying to remove the nail with a kick, the angry demon closed the city gate. ||85|| As the two brothers quickly knocked down the gate with their feet, the enemy said, "No one else can leave except you two." ||86||
After that, knowing that their destruction was inevitable, the two mothers and the father, filled with sorrow, said, "Oh sons! Go. Perhaps, while you are alive, the family will not be destroyed." Thus, with the words of their elders imprinted on their minds, the two brothers, filled with sorrow and grief, comforted their distressed and sorrowful parents, fell at their feet, and, accepting their words, left the city. ||87-89||

Emerging from the city engulfed in flames, the two brothers stood motionless, unsure of where to go. They wept, clinging to each other's necks, and then turned towards the south. ||90||

Meanwhile, Vasudeva and the other Yadavas, along with their wives, attained liberation and were born in heaven. ||91||

Those who had attained the ultimate body, including the sons of Balarama, embraced the path of non-attachment and were guided by the Jrimbhaka towards the presence of the Jina. ||92||

Many Yadavas and their wives, whose souls were devoted to Dharma and who were pure in their right vision, had embraced the path of liberation. ||93||

Though many were consumed by the flames, the fire only destroyed their bodies, not their meditation.  "Oh, the fire is fierce, but it cannot destroy the meditation." ||94||

The four types of obstacles, arising from the false vision, often lead to distressful meditation. But for those with right vision, such obstacles never arise. ||95||

Those who are imbued with the teachings of the Jina never lose their composure, whether facing inevitable or unexpected death. ||96||

For those with false vision, death is a cause for sorrow. But for those with pure vision, death in meditation is not a cause for sorrow. ||97||

Death is inevitable for all beings in the cycle of birth and death. Therefore, one should strive to die in meditation, even when faced with obstacles. ||98||

Those who, despite being consumed by the flames, leave their bodies with a pure mind, are truly blessed. ||99||

Austerity and death, when they bring happiness to oneself and others, are commendable. But austerity, like that of Dvaipayana, which causes suffering to oneself and others, is not commendable. ||100||

A wicked person who harms others may commit their act of violence in a single lifetime, but they will suffer the consequences of their actions for lifetimes to come. ||101||

A being, under the influence of passions, may kill others in this life or not, but they will always kill themselves in every life. They may or may not be the cause of suffering for others, but they are always the cause of their own suffering in the cycle of existence. ||102||

## English Translation:

**762**

In the Harivamsha Purana, it is said that when Dvaipayana picked up the iron ball in the evening, he intended to kill.  He first burned himself, being under the influence of the kshayas.  ||10|| For some, this extreme penance is the end of the cycle of birth and death, but for Dvaipayana, it became the cause of a long cycle of birth and death. ||10|| What is the fault of a being who acts according to his own karma? Even a diligent person is deceived by the enemy of delusion. ||105|| Even an intolerant person may harm another, but he should always benefit himself in this world and the next. ||106|| Because causing suffering to others brings a chain of suffering to oneself, forgiveness is inevitable - it is definitely something to be embraced. ||107||

**Shārdūlavikrīḍita**

Blind with anger, under the control of fate, Dvaipayana destroyed the entire city of Dwaraka, filled with children, women, animals, and elders, and with many gates.  He abandoned the Jain teachings and destroyed it in six months.  Shame on anger, the cause of harm to oneself and others, and the growth of the cycle of birth and death. ||108||

Thus ends the sixty-first chapter of the Harivamsha Purana, composed by Jinasena Acharya, which is part of the Arishta-nemi Purana, and describes the destruction of Dwaraka. ||6||

**Notes:**

* **Kshaya:**  A negative emotion or passion, such as anger, greed, pride, etc.

## Chapter Sixty-Two

Those who had attained unparalleled elevation from Punyodaya, possessing the Chakra and other jewels, powerful, holders of the titles Balabhadra and Narayana, were now bereft of jewels and kin due to the depletion of their merit. Only their lives remained, and they were consumed by sorrow. ||1-2||

Seeking only the hope of survival, the two brothers set out towards the south. Exhausted by hunger and thirst, they yearned for a suitable shelter on their path. ||3||

With the Pandavas as their target, they were heading towards Mathura in the south. They reached the city of Hastavapra, where Krishna stayed in a garden. Balarama, with a signal and his body covered in clothes, entered the city to obtain food and water. ||4-5||

In that city resided King Acchhadanta, a descendant of Dhritarashtra, renowned as an archer and a seeker of the Yadavas' weaknesses. ||6||

As the valiant Balarama entered the city, crowds of people, captivated by his form, were astonished and amazed to see him. ||7||

Balarama, having given his bangle and earring to someone in the market, purchased food and drink. As he was leaving the city, the king's guards recognized him as Balarama and informed the king. The king then dispatched his entire army to kill him. ||8-9||

A large crowd of soldiers gathered at the city gate to stop Balarama. Balarama signaled to Krishna, who arrived swiftly. ||10||

Balarama secured the food and drink and took an elephant-tying post, while Krishna, somewhat enraged, lifted a formidable mace. ||11||

Harivamsha Purana
Then, that army with its commander, being bewildered, fled in all directions, having been defeated by the two brothers. ||12||
Then, after taking food and drink, the two brothers left the city and came to a forest called Vijay. There they saw a beautiful lake. ||13||
After bathing in the lake, they bowed to the Jina, who was enshrined in their hearts, and ate various kinds of food, drank very cold water, and rested for a while. After resting, the two heroes went south and entered the terrible forest called Kaushambi, which was very difficult for others to enter. ||14-15||
All directions of that forest were filled with the sounds of birds and jackals, herds of deer suffering from thirst were wandering here and there, a great thirst was rising there, the forest was very unbearable due to the scorching heat of summer and the harsh wind blowing, and the groups of creepers, bushes and trees were burnt by the forest fire. ||16-17||
In that forest, where there was no possibility of finding water, where the sound of the breath of wild animals running was heard, and where pearls were scattered here and there from the broken tusks of elephants by the forest dwellers, when the very sharp sun was rising in the middle of the sky, then the tired Krishna said to his elder brother Baldev, who was superior in qualities, 'O Arya! I am very thirsty, my lips and palate are dry, now I am not able to walk even a step further. ||18-20||
Therefore, O Arya! Give me cold water, which removes thirst, like the right vision in the beginningless and essence-less world.' ||21||
Hearing this, Baldev, whose mind was softened by the flow of affection, said to Krishna, who was breathing hot breaths, 'Brother! I will bring you cold water and give it to you now, you meanwhile remove your thirst with the water of remembrance of the Jina. ||22-23||
This water only removes thirst for a short time, but the water of remembrance of the Jina

The shade of this tree is cool, sit here. I will bring you cool water from the lake. ||25||

Saying this, Balarama, holding his younger brother Krishna in his heart, went to fetch water, not thinking of his own fatigue. ||26||

Krishna, as instructed, went to the shade of the tree and lay down on the soft earth, his body covered with a fine garment. ||27||

In the dense forest, he rested for a moment, placing his right foot on his left knee, to relieve his fatigue. ||28||

Jarasandha's son, a lover of hunting, was wandering alone in the forest and by chance came to that very spot. ||29||

It was fate that brought him there, for he, who had left Dwaraka out of love for Krishna and to protect his life, had entered the forest like a deer. ||30||

He saw something indistinct in the distance, his bow in hand. ||31||

Thinking that the movement was the ear of a sleeping deer, he mistook it for the wind blowing against Krishna's garment. ||32||

His body hidden in the bushes, his mind like a hunter's, he drew his bow with great force and pierced Krishna's foot with a sharp arrow. ||33||

Krishna, his foot pierced, rose up suddenly and looked in all directions. Seeing no one, he cried out in a loud voice, "Who has pierced my foot? Let him reveal his lineage and name clearly." ||34-35||

"I have never slain a man in battle whose lineage and name were unknown. What misfortune has befallen me today?" ||36||

"Tell me, who are you, with your unknown lineage and unknown animosity? Who has become my slayer in this forest?" ||37||

Page #804:
---------------------------
In the Harivamsha Purana, it is said that a king named Vasudeva, born of the Harivamsa lineage, was the father of Balarama and Krishna. I, Jaratkumara, am his beloved son. I am a lone warrior, wandering in this forest where cowards dare not tread.  Following the command of Nemijina, I have been dwelling in this forest for twelve years, fearing that I would be the cause of Krishna's death. My younger brother Krishna is dear to me, and that is why I have stayed here for so long. During this time, I have not heard the name of any Arya. Who are you? 

Hearing these words, Krishna recognized his brother and, overcome with affection, exclaimed, "Brother! Come here, come here!" 

Jaratkumara, recognizing his younger brother, cried out in joy and, throwing his bow and arrows to the ground, fell at Krishna's feet. 

Krishna lifted him up, and Jaratkumara, clinging to his neck, began to lament. Krishna said, "Brother, do not grieve so much. What is destined cannot be avoided."  

"O noble warrior," Krishna continued, "you have renounced all worldly pleasures to prevent the occurrence of a calamity. A virtuous man, fearing disgrace and sin, strives with wisdom. But what can he do when fate is cruel?"

Jaratkumara then asked Krishna why he had come to the forest. Krishna recounted the entire tragic tale, from the beginning to the burning of Dwarka. 

Hearing of the destruction of his lineage, Jaratkumara cried out, "Brother! I have received you as a guest after so long! What should I do? Where should I go? Where can I find peace of mind? Alas, Krishna! By killing you, I have brought upon myself both sorrow and disgrace in this world."

Krishna, with his noble heart, said to Jaratkumara, who was lamenting thus, "O King! Abandon your grief. The entire world is reaping the fruits of its own actions."

**5.** Who gives happiness or sorrow in the cycle of existence? Who is a friend or an enemy? In reality, one's own actions bring happiness or sorrow.

**52.** Rama has gone to fetch water for me. Until he returns, you should leave quickly. He might become agitated towards you.

**53.** Go and inform the Pandavas of everything beforehand. They are well-wishers and close to our family, and they will surely protect you.

**54.** Saying this, he gave him his Kaustubha gem as a token of recognition and respect. He then turned slightly and said, "Go."

**55.** Taking the Kaustubha gem in his hand, Jaratkumar said, "O Lord, please forgive me." Saying this, he slowly removed the arrow and left from there.

**56.** After Jaratkumar left, Krishna was overwhelmed with pain from his wound. He turned towards the north and bowed to the five Supreme Beings.

**57.** With folded hands, he repeatedly bowed to the present Tirthankara, Shri Nemijineendra, remembering his virtues.

**58.** Because all the troubles of the earth are destroyed by the conduct of the Jina, Krishna, with his head bowed, lay down on the earth as his bed.

**59.** He, whose entire body was covered with clothes, whose mind was free from all attachments, and who was friendly with all, was filled with such auspicious thoughts.

**60.** Blessed are those sons, grandsons, wives, brothers, gurus, and friends who, considering the future, engage in austerities before the fire of calamities.

**61.** It is a great misfortune that thousands of wives and thousands of friends, without performing austerities, met their death in the mouth of fire.

**62.** Due to the heavy burden of my karma, I have not performed austerities. May my right faith be my support in escaping the cycle of existence.

**50.** Leave, the entire world inevitably experiences the consequences of its actions.

*The one who gives happiness or sorrow is karma, it shakes the world.
Just as the wind shakes the flag, so does karma shake the world.*

## Chapter Sixty-Three: The Tale of the Chariot

**Balarama, filled with love, was extremely anxious to obtain water. Carrying Krishna in his heart, he continued to move forward. Though inauspicious omens obstructed him at every step, he still traveled far into the forest.** (1)

**He ran along the path taken by herds of deer, repeatedly deceived by mirages that appeared like pools of water. At that time, all directions seemed to him to be filled with rippling lakes.** (2)

**Then Balarama saw a lake teeming with sweet-voiced chakravakas, kalhansas, and sarasas. It was filled with waves and adorned with lotus flowers buzzing with bees.** (3)

**Upon seeing the lake, Balarama's heart let out a long sigh. The cool, fragrant breeze, as if expressing its friendship, touched his body.** (4)

**Seeing Balarama, thirsty wild animals approached from all sides with fearful eyes. He then reached the lake, fragrant with the intoxicating water of wild elephants, and was welcomed with great respect.** (5)

**He entered the cool water of the sacred pool, quenched his thirst, and relieved his suffering. He then made a vessel from a lotus leaf, filled it with water, and covered it with his cloth.** (6)

**Carrying the water, he ran with great speed. The dust raised by his feet turned his hair gray, and his heart trembled repeatedly with the fear, "I have left Krishna alone in this forest full of obstacles."** (7)

**1. Though obstructed by omens, he...** (1)

"Thus, it is said that he slept for a long time.
He did not wake up. ||10||
770
In the Harivamsha Purana, Balarama saw Krishna from afar, his body covered by a cloth. He thought, "Krishna, the valiant one, is sleeping in a deep sleep in the land where I left him." ||8||
Approaching him, he thought, "He is sleeping in a peaceful sleep, so let him wake up on his own." Thus, ignoring the need to wake Krishna, he waited for him to wake up. ||9||
"O valiant one! Why are you sleeping for so long? Enough, wake up from your sleep and drink water as you wish." Thus, speaking in a sweet voice, he repeated these words a couple of times and then remained silent, holding back his words. ||10||
Then, Balarama saw a black fly with sharp eyes, agitated, entering and trying to exit the cloth covering Krishna, attracted by the smell of blood. ||11||
Seeing Krishna's face contorted in pain, Balarama cried out, "Alas! I am killed! He is dead, indeed, from thirst!" Thinking this, he fell upon Krishna's body. ||12||
Balarama, whose mind was deeply infatuated by Krishna's charm, fainted immediately. Although fainting was undesirable, it was a great boon to him at that time. Otherwise, bound by the strong ties of affection, Balarama would have surely died. ||13||
Regaining consciousness, he touched Krishna's body all over with his own hands. At that moment, he saw the wound on his foot, red with blood, emitting a strong odor. ||14||
He realized that Krishna had been struck in the foot by a sharp arrow while sleeping. Who is this hunter, who has killed Krishna, who is difficult to wake up, and who has achieved this unprecedented feat of hunting today? ||15||"

**771**

Thus speaking, the enraged Baladeva roared like a lion, a terrifying sound that spread throughout the forest, shattering the pride of tigers, lions, and elephants that roamed the dense wilderness.  ||16||

He thought, "By some cruel twist of fate, my younger brother, lying asleep, has been slain by some enemy who has deceived him. He will soon appear before me." ||17||

"Those who possess the wealth of glory do not kill even an enemy who is asleep, unarmed, submissive, devoid of pride, repeatedly fleeing, burdened with obstacles, a woman, or a child." ||18||

Speaking loudly, he ran around for a while, but finding no other path, he returned to Krishna, embraced him, and wept. ||19||

"Alas, beloved of the world! Alas, master of the universe! Alas, refuge of all beings! Alas, savior of mankind! Where have you gone, leaving me behind? Alas, brother! Come quickly, come quickly!" Thus, he cried for a long time. ||20||

He repeatedly gave Krishna, who was unconscious and lifeless, water that was beautiful and soothing, but just as the right vision does not enter the heart of the distant, so too, the water did not enter his throat. ||21||

The strong-willed Baladeva sat facing him, washing his face with gentle hands, looking at him with joy, licking him, smelling him, and wanting to hear his words. The Acharya says, "Shame on such self-delusion!" ||22||

"Dwarikpuri, with its vast wealth like heaven, has been consumed by fire. What is the need for food now?" Thinking this, are you burning with grief? No, brother! The land of Bharata, filled with various inexhaustible treasures, still exists as before. ||23||

Who has obtained the fruit of hunting here today? ||15||

"Are you being deluded by the thought that you are without kin because the lineage of Bhojaraja and the Yadavas have perished?"  Why are you so confused?  If you and I are alive, then know that all our kin are alive.  (24)  You have looked at me with unwavering eyes in many past lives and in this life as well.  You have never been satisfied, so how can you be satisfied today?  (25)  Alas!  Driven by delusion, I left you alone to fetch water and in my absence, I caused the theft of the jewel of the world, the human gem.  Who could have stolen it while I was with you?  (26)  Oh brother!  You were like a thunderbolt to destroy the mountain of Kansa's anger and pride.  You were like Garuda to destroy the demons and the Vidyaadharas.  You were like a drinker of the ocean of Jarasandha's fame.  But alas, you have drowned in this cow-dung.  (27)  See, O Narayana, the sun, like you, with its fierce brilliance, destroys the darkness of night, which is like an enemy, and burns the world.  Now it is setting in the west.  (28)  Seeing you, both of you, immersed in sleep, the sun, as if in sorrow, has drawn back its rays, like hands, from other places and placed them on the head of the setting sun.  And it seems as if it is mourning for you.  Indeed, this sleep of yours, for whom is it not a cause for sorrow in the three worlds?  (29)  The sun, drunk with the wine of the west, is setting, and the group of swans, with tearful eyes, are lamenting its fate.  It is right that it should fall, for who does not fall who is a lover of wine?  (30)  Or perhaps the sun, having cast off the burden of sorrow, is now immersing itself in the ocean.  It seems as if it wants to give you a libation of water.  Time, the knower of all, is doing what is right.  (31)

Behold, the entire world is enveloped in the redness of the evening sky, as if it were blushing with the tears of all beings, their eyes red from weeping, while you are lost in deep slumber. (32)

O devotee of the gods! This evening too, fading away, is following the chariot of the swiftly departing sun. Arise and offer your evening salutations. What good is sleep, O god, when it is in vain? (33)

Like the sixth kalpa, Atiduhsama, which makes the entire world one color (without distinction of caste), dark in hue, and devoid of vision (lacking the power to see), so too, this offspring of darkness spreads rapidly in all directions. (34)

See, these wild animals, endowed with the strength of their sense of smell and hearing, are approaching, guided by the scent and sound of their feet. Come, let us go to this fort, where we shall spend the night in safety. (35)

O brother! You, who used to adorn yourself with flowers, in a wondrous pavilion, and receive the homage of your kin and kings, and who, in the company of women, slept on a bed of softest cushions, adorned with pillows, and nourished by Lakshmi, are now sleeping on a stony path, served by a multitude of creatures like jackals, crows, and owls, who dwell in the caves of mountains and forests.

You, who once delighted in amorous play with women, who were appeased by their love and who appeased them in turn, and who spent the night in the company of love, are now devoid of consciousness and spending the night. (38)

O hero! You, who used to awaken in the morning to the sweet music of beautiful women and the sound of the chanting of your devotees, are now surrounded by the silence of the night. (39)

This is because a man who knows time acts according to the needs of the moment. (40)

In the Harivamsha Purana, it is said that to know your whereabouts, the evening, sent by the former friend-husband, is red with love, as if the sun had sent her earlier to know your news, therefore, be free from the bed - get up and sit. ||40||
Look, the sun is rising from the Udhayachala, as if it is rushing to offer you, the chief man, an arghya with lotuses blooming from its rays. ||41||
Here, hundreds of flatterers, made by Siri, as dear as life to Hari, were all in vain, like sweet words spoken to a deeply sleeping innocent child. ||42||
Just as at birth, Balabhadra took Krishna into the embrace of his arm-like cage, and Vasudeva held an umbrella over him, fearing Kansa, so now, feeling the pleasure of the sense of touch, he took him into the embrace of his arm-like cage and wandered with him in the middle of the forest. ||43||
Thus, after many days and nights, his mind, speech, and body did not become even slightly lazy, he wandered in the forest every day carrying Krishna's body, and did not get even a little pleasure. ||44||
When the summer season passed and the rainy season, which destroys the splendor of the sun, brought joy to the world with its roaring clouds and rain, Jaratkumar, wearing the strange attire of a Bhil, as instructed by Krishna, reached the Pandava city of Dakshina Mathura, full of beautiful people, without interruption. ||45-46||

## The Thirty-Sixth Chapter

**775**

The messenger, Hari-datta, who had been sent by Krishna, entered the assembly of the Pandavas with due respect and observed all the proper protocols.  Upon taking his seat, Yudhishthira and the others inquired about the well-being of their lord.  ||47||

Jaratkumara, his voice choked with grief and trembling, recounted the news of the destruction of Dwarka and its inhabitants, and the death of Krishna due to his own carelessness.  To confirm his words, he presented the radiant Kaustubha gem, a gift from Krishna, before them.  Overwhelmed with sorrow, Jaratkumara wailed loudly, his voice breaking with anguish.  ||48-49||

At that moment, a great wave of lamentation arose from the throats of Kunti and the wives of the Pandavas.  The entire assembly joined in the weeping, filling the Pandava palace with a sound like the roaring ocean.  ||50||

They cried out, "Alas, the great leader! Alas, the unparalleled hero! Alas, the one who always strived to alleviate the suffering of the world! What a terrible fate has befallen you! Alas!"  Their lamentations continued for a long time.  ||51||

When the weeping subsided, the Pandavas, along with their many relatives, who were well-versed in the ways of the world, gathered around and offered water to Krishna for the satisfaction of those present.  ||52||

Having shed their previous attire of mourning, which had somewhat eased their mental anguish, the Pandavas, with a desire to see the land of the righteous, set out on their journey.  ||53||

**Harivamsha Purana**

The Pandavas, along with Draupadi and other queens, their mothers and sons, and their army, traveled with great speed and reached the forest after a few days. They saw Balarama there. At that time, Balarama was performing the useless rituals of bathing, anointing, and adorning the dead body of Krishna. Seeing him, all the relatives embraced him with reverence and wept loudly for a long time. 

**54-55**

Kunti and her sons bowed down and requested Balarama to perform the funeral rites of Krishna. But just as a child does not give away a poisonous fruit when asked, but instead gets angry, similarly, Balarama did not give Krishna's dead body when asked, but instead became angry.

**56**

Balarama said, "O Pandavas! Prepare for the bath quickly and then arrange for excellent food and drink. Our Lord (Krishna) is thirsty and wants to eat soon." Upon hearing this, the Pandavas prepared for the bath and food.

**57**

Balarama seated Krishna on a seat, bathed him, fed him, and gave him water. But all his efforts were in vain. Although the Pandavas also considered Balarama's actions to be useless, they still followed his instructions and considered themselves to have fulfilled their duty.

**58**

Thus, the Pandavas, following Balarama, spent the rainy season in that forest, performing the rituals as he instructed. After that, the autumn season arrived to pierce the veil of their delusion.

**59**

Previously, Krishna's body always emitted a fragrance like that of the Saptparna flower. But at that time, a foul odor began to emanate, and it spread far and wide. This is natural, for both fragrances cannot coexist.

**60**

Then, Krishna's brother, Siddhartha, who was a charioteer, died and became a god in heaven. He had accepted the arrangement of being addressed during his initiation. Due to the proximity of the time of his death,

## Chapter Sixty-Three

The chariot, having crossed the extremely uneven bank, broke down on the even path. The god, having joined it, was again showing it to the Siriṇa, but it was not getting fixed. || 62 ||

Siriṇa said, "O brother! It is a great wonder that your chariot did not break down on the uneven bank of the mountain, but it broke down on the even path. Now, how is it possible for it to be fixed again in this birth? Your effort to fix it is in vain." || 63 ||

The wise god, who was a witness to the end of the battle of the Mahābhārata, replied, "How can he rise again in this birth, who, being struck by the arrow released from the bow held by Jarāsandha, fell down merely by the impact of the arrow?" || 64 ||

Saying this, the god started planting a delicate lotus on the rocky ground where there was no water. Seeing this, Siriṇa asked, "How can a lotus grow on the rocky ground?" || 65 ||

The god replied, "How can Krishna be born in a lifeless body?" After answering, he started watering a dry tree. Siriṇa again asked, "Brother! What is the benefit of watering a dry tree?" The god replied, "What is the benefit of bathing Krishna, who is dead?" Then, the god started feeding grass and water to a dead bull. Seeing this, Siriṇa again asked, "O fool! What is the benefit of feeding grass and water to this dead body?" The god replied, "What is the benefit of feeding Krishna, who is dead?" In this way, the god explained to Siriṇa with great difficulty. || 66 ||

Having understood the truth, Siriṇa said, "Krishna is truly lifeless. O noble human! What you are saying is true, there is no other truth in this; O virtuous man! O worthy one! You have spoken well." || 67 ||

The god replied, "Everything that has happened here was already known to Neminātha, even though you know the state of being. You have wasted six months carrying Krishna's body in vain." || 68 ||

He came near Baldeva for addressing him. || 61 ||

Harivamsha Purana
Who is the external violent one in this world? One's own internal good deeds are the protector. "Life is the cause of one's own protection, its destruction leads to destruction in all ways." || 69 || Wealth is as fickle as the ear of an elephant. Associations bring sorrow due to separation from loved ones, and life is tasteless due to the sorrow of death. Liberation is imperishable, therefore the wise should strive to attain it. || 70 || Thus, Balabhadra, who had attained the three jewels and whose delusion had been dispelled, the one who had assumed the form of his previous birth, was shining brightly at that time, like the moon devoid of clouds. || 71 || Thereafter, along with the Pandavas and Jaratkumara, he performed the cremation rites of Krishna on the peak of Tungigiri, gave the kingdom to Jaratkumara, and realizing the fleeting nature of life, he resolved to renounce possessions and took refuge on the peak of the same mountain with his companions. He said, "Even though I reside here, I have attained the discipleship of Shri Nemijinenndra, who resides in the Pallava country." Saying this, he plucked the hair from his head with his five fists and took the monastic vows. || 72-74 || Balabhadra was extremely handsome. Therefore, when he entered the city for Parana, the women began to behave in a contrary manner. Knowing this, Balabhadra, the warrior who bore the three yogas, vowed, "If I get alms in the forest, I will take them, otherwise not." Thus, he attained contentment. || 75 || The Pandavas gave many royal daughters to Jaratkumara, the king of the Harivansha, entrusted the wealth of the kingdom to their sons, and then, with their eyes fixed on the Jinenndra, all of them proceeded towards the Pallava country. || 76 ||

## Chapter Sixty-Three

**Draupadi and other women, along with Kunti, who followed the Pandavas, had their minds fixed on liberation.**  They had renounced their attachment to the world. **Balabhadra, the steadfast upholder of unblemished conduct, and a firm destroyer of the three-fold bonds of body, speech, and mind, was engrossed in contemplating the twelve Anupreksha (contemplations).** 

He thought, "Where there is attachment to palaces, body, wealth, worldly pleasures, and relatives, based on the belief that these are permanent, there is no permanence except in the soul. All else is transient." 

**Just as a fawn caught in the jaws of a tiger has no refuge, so too, for one afflicted by the pain of death, there is no refuge in relatives, wealth, or anything other than Dharma.**  Thus, he contemplated the Anupreksha of being without refuge.

**Beings, driven by the harsh machinery of karma, wander through the cycle of existence, born into various species and families, experiencing the roles of master, servant, father, and son.**

**This soul is born alone and dies alone. There is no other helper except Dharma.**  Thus, he contemplated the Anupreksha of oneness.

**I am eternal, and the body is impermanent. I am conscious, and the body is unconscious. If I am different from the body, why should I not be different from other things?**

**This body, whether mine or another's, is born from impure semen and blood, is composed of seven elements, and is afflicted by the three humors (vata, pitta, and kapha).  Who is the pure soul that dwells in this impure body?**

In the Harivamsha Purana, it is said that there are three types of asrava: Kaya Yoga, Vachan Yoga, and Mano Yoga. These are the causes of the influx of punya and papa karma into the soul. After asrava, the soul is bound by the strong chains of karma bandha and wanders in the terrible cycle of samsara for a long time. ||85|| The cessation of both dravya asrava and bhaava asrava is called samvara. This samvara is achieved through gati, samiti, dharma, anupreksha, parisahjaya, and charitra. When samvara is achieved along with nirjara, the soul becomes liberated by the destruction of its own karma. ||86|| There are two types of nirjara based on the difference between anubandhini and niranubandhini. Then, there are two types of anubandhini nirjara based on the difference between akusala and kusala. The nirjara that occurs in the hells and other lower realms due to the constant influence of karma is called akusala anubandhini nirjara. The nirjara that occurs in the realms of gods and other higher realms due to the influence of samyama is called kusala anubandhini nirjara. The nirjara after which there is a continued binding of karma is called anubandhini nirjara. The nirjara after which the past karma is destroyed but there is no binding of new karma is called niranubandhini nirjara.
The supreme yogi, Baldev Muni, contemplated on this niranubandhini anupreksha. ||87|| The existence of the world is beginningless and endless. This world is situated in the middle of the space of the universe. Within this world, the six types of beings constantly experience suffering. This contemplation is called lokanupreksha. ||88|| First, it is rare to be born in the world of the stationary beings after being born in the womb of a mother. Then, it is rare to obtain a body. Even among the bodies, it is rare to have the perfection of the senses. Even with the perfection of the senses, it is extremely rare to attain the knowledge of the three jewels, which is characterized by the appropriate dharma and the fruit of which is the attainment of the highest samadhi. ||89|| The dharma described by the Jina, which is characterized by ahimsa, etc., is the cause of liberation. By abandoning this dharma, one attains the suffering of samsara. This contemplation is called the final dharma anupreksha. ||90|| Thus, Baldev Muni, who had a sharp intellect and contemplated on the twelve anuprekshas, which are famous by tradition, conquered the attachment of his brother by defeating the twenty-two enemies in the form of parisahja. ||91|| 1.

**12.** Due to the consumption of coarse food like gruel, etc., their gastric fire was intensely burning. Even then, for the sake of attaining liberation, they would eat only half their fill. Thus, they conquered the **Kshudha-parishaha** (hunger).

**23.** The great sage, Baldev Muni, the holder of unwavering fortitude, was not afflicted by the intense thirst, like a blazing fire consuming the forest, which was a part of the body-mountain, because he was anointed by the cloud of peace. Thus, he conquered the **Trisha-parishaha** (thirst).

**94.** Day and night, they sat on a platform, enduring the intense wind and snow. During the stormy rainy season, they sat under a tree, battling the harsh cold. Thus, they conquered the **Sheeta-parishaha** (cold).

**95.** Standing on the peak of a mountain, they endured the scorching heat from all sides. The smoke of the blazing fire enveloped them, making it seem as if they were warding off the heat with the shade of an umbrella. Thus, they conquered the **Ushna-parishaha** (heat).

**96.** They remained unmoved even when their blood was profusely sucked by the boneless creatures like leeches and mosquitoes, which came stealthily. Thus, they endured the severe **Dansha-Mshaka-parishaha** (bite and mosquito).

**97.** They endured the **Nagnya-parishaha** (nakedness), which was attached to the body, devoid of any attachment, not worthy of trust, difficult to bear even for a day, and like a virtuous wife, full of modesty. They endured it according to their will.

**98.** They wandered alone in the mountainous paths and the inaccessible forests, suitable for meditation, always devoted to the practice of Dharma, and engaged in conquering the **Rati-parishaha** (lust) like an enemy.

**99.** They conquered the powerful **Stri-parishaha** (women) by rendering futile the efforts of the warrior-like Cupid, who showered arrows of glances from his bow made of the curved eyebrow.

In the Harivamsha Purana, the Tirthabhumivihati, while traveling without any diminution in his vows, was not distressed by the thought of vehicles, wealth, or fear, due to his Charya-Parishaha. ||10||
In secluded places, with his mind purified by meditation, and possessing a brilliant intellect, Baldev Muni was never troubled by the Nishadya-Parishaha, even when bound by the rules of the place and time. ||11||
The Muni, immersed in meditation and study, slept very little, only for a short time, and on one side, on the earth as his bed, without any covering. Thus, he was never afflicted by the Shayya-Parishaha. ||102||
Even when wounded in his heart by sharp, harsh words from wicked people, the Muni, with his steadfast intellect, always remembered that he should be filled with forgiveness, enduring the pain of insults. ||103||
The Muni always held this thought: "If my body is killed by a multitude of weapons and arms, even then I should endure the Vadh-Parishaha well." ||104||
This Muni, practicing both external and internal austerities, with a body reduced to mere bones, was always engaged in the practice of Charya, but never begged for food or anything else, thus conquering the Yachana-Parishaha. ||105||
The Muni, silent, showing only his body, following the Chandri-Charya, entering the homes of both rich and poor like the moon, and remaining content with both gain and loss, thus conquered the Alaba-Parishaha. ||106||
He did not react to the roughness, coldness, and unsuitability of his food, or to the diseases arising from the aggravation of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. He always ignored them, thus conquering the Roga-Parishaha. ||107||

Even when afflicted by rough particles of lac, grass, and gravel in his bed, seat, etc., his inner self remained undisturbed, and he endured the **Tṛṇasparśa-pariṣaha** (affliction of touching grass) well. || 108 ||

The white-bodied Muni, covered in dirt, never touched his body with his fingernails, and he remained radiant like the moon covered in dark clouds on the peak of a mountain. || 109 ||

He felt no joy when others honored him, and no distress when they disrespected him. He always kept his intellect pure, and thus he endured the **Satskāra-puruskāra-pariṣaha** (affliction of honor and reward) well. || 110 ||

At this time, there is no one on earth who is a better orator, speaker, poet, or great poet than him. He did not allow this pride to taint him in the slightest, thanks to his **Prajñā-pariṣaha** (affliction of wisdom). || 111 ||

This one is neither ignorant, nor an animal, nor a human. He does not see, nor does he speak falsely. He has simply taken a vow of silence. He endured the **Ajñāna-pariṣaha** (affliction of ignorance) from such ignorant people. || 112 ||

It is pointless to say that great wealth is obtained through the power of intense austerities, because we have not seen any such wealth obtained even today. Thus, the pure and right-seeing Baldeva Muni never said such a thing. He endured the **Adarśana-pariṣaha** (affliction of not seeing) well. || 113 ||

Thus, the Muni Baldeva, who had destroyed the enemies in the form of **pariṣaha**, who was the destroyer of the vices of the five senses, who was extremely beautiful in body, and who wandered in the realms of the **Samyak-cāritra** (right conduct) as ordained by the Jinas, performed austerities for a long time. || 114 ||

Thus ends the sixty-third chapter of the **Harivaṁśa-purāṇa** composed by Jinaseṇa Ācārya, which is part of the **Ariṣṭanemi-purāṇa**, and which describes the austerities of Baldeva. || 63 ||

**Note:** There is a difference in the order of verses 113-114 in the **K** and **ṅ** manuscripts.

## Chapter Sixty-Four

The Pandavas, terrified by the intense fear of the cycle of birth and death, reached the Pallva country where they found the Lord Jinendra, adorned by four types of gods, residing in the Samavasarana, and possessing the eight extraordinary powers. They circumambulated and bowed to the Lord. || 1-2 ||

Having drunk the nectar of Dharma from the rain-like form of the Jinendra, they inquired about their past lives. The Jinendra then narrated their past lives. || 3 ||

In the same Bharat Kshetra, in the city of Champa, when King Meghavahana, the ornament of the Kuru dynasty, was protecting the earth, there lived a Brahmin named Somadev. He had a wife named Somila, and they had three sons: Somadatta, Somil, and Somabhuti. || 4-5 ||

Their maternal uncle was Agnibhuti, whose wife was Agnila. They had three daughters: Dhanshri, Somashri, and Nagashri, who were respectively married to the three sons of Somadev. || 6 ||

Somadev, the knower of all the Vedas, became disgusted with the cycle of birth and death and took initiation into the Jain religion. || 7 ||

His three sons, Somadatta and the others, were also inclined towards the Jain religion. They were devoted to the duties of householders and followed the four aims of life: Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha. || 8 ||

One day, a monk named Dharma Ruchi, who seemed like an unbroken piece of Dharma, entered their house while on his begging rounds. || 9 ||

Somadatta, with great humility, offered him hospitality. After offering hospitality, he became busy with other work and entrusted Nagashri with the task of offering alms. || 10 ||

Due to the karmic consequences of her past sins, Nagashri, filled with anger towards the monk, offered him food mixed with poison. As a result, the monk attained liberation through death by renunciation. || 11 ||

Knowing about Nagashri's evil deed, the three brothers were deeply saddened. They renounced the world and took initiation from the Guru Varuna. || 12 ||

Dhanshri and Mitrashri, overwhelmed by the sorrow of worldly existence, also desired to take initiation, but they were prevented by their respective husbands. || 13 ||

**27.** This six-fold external penance is dependent on external objects and is caused by external factors.

**28.** Internal penance is desired for the control of the mind. There are nine types of atonement penance for purification of committed offenses.

**29.** Respect for the venerable is called humility. There are four types of humility. Serving with one's own body and other objects is called *Vaiyavrittya*, and it has ten types.

**30.** Abandoning laziness in the pursuit of knowledge is called *Swadhyaya*, and it has five types. Abandoning the thought of "this is mine" regarding external and internal possessions is called *Vyutsarga*, and it has two types.

**31.** Abandoning the fickleness of the mind is called *Dhyana*, and it has four types. Among these, *Aat* and *Roudra* are two types of faulty meditation, while *Dharmya* and *Shukla* are two types of excellent meditation.

**32.** *Aalocana* is a type of atonement penance that involves complete renunciation of ten types of offenses. It involves confessing to the Guru about the offenses committed due to negligence.

In the Harivamsha Purana, there are ten types of monks: 1. The Acharya who initiates, 2. The Upadhyaya who maintains the system of education, 3. The Tapasvi who excels in austerity, 4. The Shaikshya who receives education, 5. The Glana who is afflicted by diseases, 6. The Gana, a community of elder monks, 7. The Kula, a community of disciples of the initiating Acharya, 8. The Sangha, a community of householders, Shullakas, Ailakas, and monks, 9. The Sadhu, a long-initiated virtuous monk, and 10. The Manojna, who is pleasing to the people. 

If these ten types of monks happen to experience illness or any other condition, or if they are inclined towards Mithyatva due to the intense rise of delusion, or if they are troubled by Mithyatva-dristi beings, or if enemies in the form of Parisha arise, then serving them appropriately to alleviate their suffering is the tenfold Vyayavritti Tapa. ||42-45||

There are five types of Swadhyaya: Vacana, Prichchhana, Anupreksha, Amnaya, and Upadesha. Providing a faultless text and its meaning to others, reading it aloud, is called Vacana Swadhyaya. Asking others to clarify uncertain truths or to strengthen certain truths is called Prichchhana Swadhyaya. Studying knowledge with the mind, contemplating it, is called Anupreksha Swadhyaya. Reading texts repeatedly is called Amnaya, and giving others teachings on Dharma is called Upadesha Swadhyaya. These five types of Swadhyaya are performed for a noble purpose, to attain the excellence of Prajna-Bhedavijnana, for inspiration, and for the growth of Tapa. ||46-48||

There are two types of Vyutsarga: Abhyantaropadithyaaga and Bahyopadithyaaga. Abandoning internal afflictions like anger, and considering the body as "not mine" is Abhyantaropadithyaaga. Abandoning external afflictions like ornaments is Bahyopadithyaaga. 

The abandonment of external and internal afflictions is undertaken for the sake of detachment, fearlessness, and to eliminate the desire to live longer. ||42-50||

The Nirjara that arises from the Tapa of a being who holds Sanvara is the cause of Moksha. This Nirjara...

**52.** The five-sensed being, who is a perfected candidate for liberation, becomes endowed with the karmic fruits and experiences an inner purification. This leads to the shedding of many karmas.

**53.** When such a being, due to the presence of the causes for attaining the first liberation, becomes a Right-Faithful, he experiences an immeasurable shedding of karmas, far greater than before.

**54.** Then, as a Shravaka, he experiences an immeasurable shedding of karmas, followed by an immeasurable shedding of karmas as a Viraata, and then an immeasurable shedding of karmas as one who detaches from infinite bonds.

**55.** Then, as one who destroys the delusion of perception, he experiences an immeasurable shedding of karmas and attains the state of a Kshayika. Then, as one who pacifies the delusion of conduct, he becomes a Muni, a pacifier of all defilements.

**56.** As one who has pacified the passions, he experiences an immeasurable shedding of karmas and resides in the eleventh stage of the path, known as the Upashanta-Kshaya. Then, as one who destroys the delusion of conduct, he experiences an immeasurable shedding of karmas and resides in the twelfth stage of the path, known as the Kshapaka.

**57.** Then, as one who has almost completely shed the passions, he experiences an immeasurable shedding of karmas and becomes a Kevali, a Jina, possessing infinite knowledge and perception.

**58.** There are five types of Nirgrantha Munis: Pulaka, Vakusha, Kushil, Nirgrantha, and Snataka.

**59.** Those who lack the understanding of the higher virtues and are not fully established in the fundamental vows are called Pulaka Munis, like the husk of grain.

**60.** Those who strictly adhere to the fundamental vows but are preoccupied with keeping their bodies and belongings clean, have an unstable family, and are associated with many other Munis, are called Vakusha Munis. They are characterized by a weak and impure conduct.

**61.** There are two types of Kushil Munis: those who are skilled in serving others and those who are skilled in controlling their passions. Those who are fully established in both the fundamental and higher virtues but sometimes violate the higher virtues and are attached to the Sangha and other possessions are called those skilled in serving others. Those who have pacified all other passions except for the passion of attachment are called those skilled in controlling their passions.

## Harivamsha Purana:

**Verse 62:** Those who have subdued their passions and are only capable of causing agitation are called *Kshaya-kushila*. There are two types of *Kushila*.

**Verse 63:** Those whose actions are not yet manifest, like the line drawn on water, and who are destined to attain Kevala Jnana in a short time are called *Nirgrantha*.

**Verse 64:** Those whose destructive karmas are exhausted are called *Snataka Kevali-ishvara*. These five types of monks are considered *Nirgrantha* according to the *Naigama* and other *Naya*.

**Verse 65:** *Pulaka* and other monks are attainable through the eight *Anuyoga* (stages of spiritual practice), starting with *Samyama*, in accordance with their respective *Sadhya-Sadhana* (means and ends).

**Verse 66:** *Pulaka*, *Vakucha*, and *Pratisevna-kushila* monks reside in the first two *Samyama* (Samayika and Chhedopasthapana), excluding the *Kshaya-kushila*. *Nirgrantha* and *Snataka* reside in the *Samyama* as described.

**Verse 67:** The five types of monks, starting with *Shruta*, are described in order.

**Verse 68:** *Pratisevna-kushila*, *Pulaka*, and *Vakucha* monks possess the ten *Purva* (previous scriptures) in their entirety.

**Verse 69:** Those who are *Kshaya-kushila* and *Nirgrantha* monks, all possess the fourteen *Purva* in their entirety.

**Verse 70:** The *Shruta* (scripture) is the object of conduct for the *Pulaka* monk, who is the lowest in the hierarchy. The eight *Pravachana-matrika* (mother of discourses), consisting of five *Samiti* and three *Gupti*, are the *Pramana-Shruta* (authoritative scripture) for all monks, up to and including the *Nirgrantha*.

**Verse 71:** The *Pulaka* monk, due to his *Pratisevna* (attachment), may sometimes forcefully observe one of the five great vows or the renunciation of night meals, even though it is not his own practice.

**Verse 72:** There are two types of *Vakucha*: *Sopkarana-Vakucha* and *Sharira-Vakucha*. The *Sopkarana-Vakucha* loves many instruments, while the *Sharira-Vakucha* is concerned with bodily adornment.

**Verse 73:** The *Pratisevna-kushila* monk does not violate the fundamental virtues, but may sometimes violate the secondary virtues.

**Verse 74:** The *Kshaya-kushila*, *Nirgrantha*, and *Snataka* monks are devoid of *Pratisevna*. All five types of monks, starting with *Pulaka*, reside in the *Tirtha* (spiritual realm) of all *Tirthankara* (liberated souls).

**Verse 75:** There are two types of *Ling* (sign): *Bhavalinga* (sign of the state of being) and *Dravyalinga* (sign of the substance). The five types of monks, starting with *Pulaka*, are *Lingin* (possessing the sign) according to the *Bhavalinga*. The *Dravyalinga* is to be understood by the wise.

## Chapter Sixty-Four

**791** The three higher Leshyas of Pulaka are Peeta, Padma, and Shukla. The six Leshyas of Vakusha and Pratisevna-Kushila are the same as the three of Pulaka, plus Kapota, Peeta, and Padma. The four higher Leshyas of Kashaya-Kushila are Kapota, Peeta, Padma, and Shukla. The single Leshya of Sukhla is found in the Sukhsma-Samparaya, Nirgrantha, and Snataka. The A-yoga-Kevali Snataka is devoid of any Leshya. **76-77**

The Uppapada of Pulaka is in the Sahasrar heaven, where he is a holder of the highest lifespan. The Uppapada of Pratisevna-Kushila and Vakusha is in the Aran and Achyuta heavens. The Uppapada of Nirgrantha (who resides in the eleventh Gunasthan) and Kashaya-Kushila is in the Sarvartha-Siddhi heaven. The Uppapada of the five Munis, starting with Pulaka, is in the Saudharma heaven, where they are holders of a lifespan equivalent to two oceans. **78-79**

Initially, the differences in the stages of Samayam are due to Kashaya, and they lead to the attainment of countless and infinite-quality Samayams. **80**

Among these, the lowest stages of attainment are those of Kashaya-Kushila and Pulaka Muni. Both these Munis progress together through countless stages, after which Pulaka Muni falls behind, while Kashaya-Kushila continues to progress through countless stages. **81-82**

After that, Vakusha and both types of Kushila progress together through countless stages, after which Vakusha falls behind, and both Kushila continue to progress. Then, after progressing together through countless stages, Pratisevna-Kushila falls behind, and Kashaya-Kushila continues to progress through countless stages. After that, Kashaya-Kushila also falls behind. Then, the stages of Kashaya-free Samayam appear, and they are attained by Nirgrantha Muni. He progresses through countless stages and then falls behind. **83-85**

After that, there remains one stage of Samayam, which is attained by the Snataka, who holds infinite qualities and virtues. He completes his Karmas there and attains Nirvana. **86**

**Note:**

* Nirgrantha is a holder of the Linga-Kaya and is worshipped by the learned in comparison to the Dravya-Linga. **75**
* The three Leshyas of Krishna, etc., are mentioned for both of them. If you ask how, it is said that due to the possibility of attachment to the means, Artha-Dhyana may occur, and with Artha-Dhyana, the three Leshyas of Krishna, etc., may occur. **1**
* The Snataka has completed his Karmas. **2**

In the Harivamsha Purana,
"The twelve Anuyogas, such as Kshetra, Kala, etc., are capable of proving the difference between the past knowledge and the present-knowledge-receiving, in the Siddhas. || 87 ||
When considered from the Kshetra Anuyoga, the Siddhi of the liberated souls, in accordance with the present-knowledge-receiving Nay, is in the Siddhi-Kshetra, or in the Atma-Pradesha, or in the regions of space. || 88 ||
And in accordance with the past-knowledge-receiving Nay, the birth takes place in all the fifteen Karma-Bhumis, and the annihilation takes place in the human world, i.e., the two and a half islands. || 89 ||
When considered from the Kala Anuyoga, this being becomes Siddha in one time period, in accordance with the present-knowledge-receiving Nay, and in accordance with the past-knowledge-receiving Nay, the being born in the Utsarpini and Avasarpini, generally becomes Siddha, and specifically in the Avasarpini, at the end of the third time period and in the fourth time period. The being born in the fourth time period can become Siddha in the fifth time period called Dushama, but the being born in the Dushama does not become Siddha in the Dushama. In accordance with the annihilation, it becomes Siddha in all the time periods of the Utsarpini and Avasarpini. Meaning - When the first time period is present in the Bharat and Airavata Kshetras, if a Vyantaradi-deva annihilates a Muni of a Videha-Kshetra and leaves him in the Bharat or Airavata Kshetra, then he can become Siddha from there. || 90-92 ||
When considered from the Gati Anuyoga, Siddhi takes place in the Siddhi-Gati or in the Manushya-Gati. When considered from the Linga Anuyoga, in accordance with the present-knowledge-receiving Nay, Siddhi takes place from the Aved, and in accordance with the past-knowledge-receiving Nay, Siddhi takes place in the three Vedas from the Bhava-Ved. Siddhi does not take place from the Dravya-Ved, it only takes place from the Purusha-Ved. Or, the meaning of Linga can also be dress, therefore, in accordance with the present-knowledge-receiving Nay, Siddhi takes place only from the Nirgrantha Linga, and in accordance with the past-knowledge-receiving Nay, it takes place from the Sagrantha Linga, or it does not take place. || 93-94 ||
When considered from the Tirtha Anuyoga, Siddhi is of two types, one becomes Siddha by becoming a Tirthankara, and the other becomes Siddha by becoming a general Kevali. Or, one becomes Siddha in the presence of a Tirthankara, and the other becomes Siddha in his Tirtha after the Tirthankara has gone to liberation. || 95 ||
When considered from the Charitra Anuyoga, in accordance with the present-knowledge-receiving Nay, Siddhi takes place only from one Yathakyata Charitra, and in accordance with the past-knowledge-receiving Nay, it takes place from four or five Charitras. Meaning - Before the Yathakyata, Samayika, Chhedopasthapana and Sukshma
1. 'Kshetra, Kala, Gati, Linga, Tirtha, Charitra, each Buddha, Bodhi, Jnana, Avagaha, after the number, from the multitude, are capable.' || 9 || T. Su.,

## Chapter 56

**9.**  **Siddi** (Liberation) is attained by each **Pratyekabuddha** (Self-Enlightened One) through their own **Bodhi** (Enlightenment), and by **Bodhitabuddha** (Enlightened One) through the **Bodhi** (Enlightenment) of others.

**98.**  **Siddi** (Liberation) can be attained through one, two, three, or four **Niviśeṣa** (Specificities).  **Niviśeṣa** (Specificities) are classified as **Utkrṣṭa** (Excellent), **Jghanya** (Inferior), and **Antarbheda** (Intermediate) based on **Avagāhana** (Absorption).

**99.**  **Utkrṣṭa** (Excellent) **Avagāhana** (Absorption) is slightly less than five hundred and twenty-five **dhanuṣ** (bows), and **Jghanya** (Inferior) **Avagāhana** (Absorption) is slightly less than three and a half **hasta** (cubits).  **Madhya** (Intermediate) **Avagāhana** (Absorption) has many variations, as much as possible.  A being attains **Siddi** (Liberation) through one of these **Avagāhana** (Absorptions).

**100.**  **Antara** (Interval) refers to the absence of **śūnyakāla** (zero time).  **Antara** (Interval) for attaining **Siddi** (Liberation) is one **samaya** (moment) for **Jghanya** (Inferior) and six months for **Utkrṣṭa** (Excellent).

**101.**  **Jghanya** (Inferior) **Siddi** (Liberation) is attained by only one being at a time, while **Utkrṣṭa** (Excellent) **Siddi** (Liberation) is attained by up to one hundred and eight beings.

**102.**  **Kṣetrādi** (Field, etc.) differences lead to different numbers of beings, which is called **alpabahutva** (fewness and multitude).  **Alpabahutva** (fewness and multitude) does not exist in the **Siddi** (Liberation) field according to the **Pratyutpannagrāhi** (Directly Perceived) **naya** (principle), but it is considered according to the **Bhūtarthagrahi** (Real Meaning) **naya** (principle).

**103.**  **Kṣetra** (Field) **Siddi** (Liberation) beings are of two types based on **janma** (birth) and **saṃhāra** (destruction).  **Saṃhāra** (Destruction) **Siddi** (Liberation) is less common, while **janma** (birth) **Siddi** (Liberation) is more common.  In the **sarvasarvājña** (omniscient) **śāsana** (teaching), **saṃhāra** (destruction) **Siddi** (Liberation) is considered to be numerically less than **janma** (birth) **Siddi** (Liberation).

**104.**  **Siddi** (Liberation) from the **ūrdhvaloka** (upper world) is less common, **Siddi** (Liberation) from the **adhojagat** (lower world) is numerically more common, and **Siddi** (Liberation) from the **tiryagloka** (animal world) is numerically even more common.

**105.**  **Saṃpārāya** (Universal) **cāritra** (conduct) is obligatory for all, while **pariharaviśuddhi** (purification of conduct) is optional for some.  Therefore, those who do not attain **pariharaviśuddhi** (purification of conduct) attain **Siddi** (Liberation) through four **cāritra** (conducts), while those who attain **pariharaviśuddhi** (purification of conduct) attain **Siddi** (Liberation) through five **cāritra** (conducts).  This is according to the **Bhūtarthagrahi** (Real Meaning) **naya** (principle).  According to the **Pratyutpannagrāhi** (Directly Perceived) **naya** (principle), there is only one **paramyathākhyāta** (perfectly known) **cāritra** (conduct) in the fourteenth **guṇasthāna** (stage of development).  Therefore, it is said that **Siddi** (Liberation) is attained through one **cāritra** (conduct).

**106.**  Considering the **jñāna** (knowledge) **anuyoga** (application), according to the **Pratyutpannagrāhi** (Directly Perceived) **naya** (principle), **Siddi** (Liberation) is attained through one **kevalajñāna** (omniscience), while according to the **Bhūtarthagrahi** (Real Meaning) **naya** (principle), **Siddi** (Liberation) is attained through two, three, or four **jñāna** (knowledges).  The meaning is that some beings have two **jñāna** (knowledges) before attaining **kevalajñāna** (omniscience): **mati** (perception) and **śruta** (scriptural knowledge).  Some have three **jñāna** (knowledges): **mati** (perception), **śruta** (scriptural knowledge), and **avadhi** (clairvoyance), or **mati** (perception), **śruta** (scriptural knowledge), and **manaḥparyaya** (mind reading).  And some have four **jñāna** (knowledges): **mati** (perception), **śruta** (scriptural knowledge), **avadhi** (clairvoyance), and **manaḥparyaya** (mind reading).

**107.**  Considering the **avagāhana** (absorption) **anuyoga** (application), there are three types of **avagāhana** (absorption) based on **utkrṣṭa** (excellent), **jghanya** (inferior), and **madhya** (intermediate).  Beings who have these **avagāhana** (absorptions) have **utkrṣṭa** (excellent) **avagāhana** (absorption) of slightly less than five hundred and twenty-five **dhanuṣ** (bows) and **jghanya** (inferior) **avagāhana** (absorption) of slightly less than three and a half **hasta** (cubits).  There are many variations of **madhya** (intermediate) **avagāhana** (absorption), as much as possible.  A being attains **Siddi** (Liberation) through one of these **avagāhana** (absorptions).

There are few Siddhas born in the ocean, and from them, there are countless Siddhas born in the islands. This is a general statement, not a specific one. Specifically, those who are Siddhas in the Salt Ocean are the fewest, and from them, there are countless Siddhas born in the Time Ocean. 

Those who are Siddhas in Jambudvipa are countless, and from them, there are countless Siddhas born in the Dhaataki Khand, and from them, there are countless Siddhas born in the Pushkaradvipa. 

Just as the statement of few and many is made in relation to the division of the realms, so too, according to the scriptures, one should know the division of time, etc. 

Thus, those who are devoted to right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, like Somadatta and others, became five beings in the Aaran Achyuta heaven at the end of their lives. There, they were gods of the common class, and their lifespan was twenty-two oceans. They enjoyed the best of pleasures, dwelling there for twenty-two oceans, while holding fast to the pure right faith. 

Nagasri, who gave mixed food, also died and received the fruit of the Dhuma Prabha, the fifth hell. She endured the great suffering there for seventeen oceans, then emerged and became a wicked serpent named Drishti Vip in the Swayamprabha island. After that, she died and went to the third earth, called Baluka Prabha, where she lived for three oceans. 

There, she endured a multitude of sufferings for a long time due to the consequences of her sins, and then she wandered for two oceans in the stationary realm. 

After that, she was born as the daughter of a Chandala in the city of Champa. There, one day, she renounced honey, meat, etc., in the presence of the sage Samadhi Gupta. 

As a result, at the end of her life, she was born as the daughter of a wealthy Vaishya named Subandhu in the same city of Champa. Her name was Sukumarika. 

Due to the consequences of her past sins, her body had a strong stench. Therefore, even though she was beautiful, she was hated by young men. 

In the same city, there lived two sons named Jindeva and Jindatta, born to the Vaishya Dhandeva and his wife Ashokadatta. 

Jindeva's relatives abandoned her, a woman with a foul odor, and she went to live with the followers of Suvrata.

## Chapter Sixty-Four

795. Though Jinadatta, the younger brother, married her, he kept her at a distance due to the foul smell. ||12||

The young woman, blaming herself, observed a fast and with great devotion fed Ksanti, an Aryika, accompanied by many other Aryikas. ||122||

Saluting Ksanti, she asked, "O Aryika, why are these two beautiful Aryikas engaged in such difficult austerities?" ||123||

Moved by compassion, Ksanti, in response to her question, explained the reason for the austerities of those two Aryikas to the young woman. ||124||

"Listen, O young woman, these two beautiful young women are engaged in austerities for this reason..." ||125||

"In a previous birth, they were Vimala and Suprabha, the celestial queens of the Saudharma heaven." ||126||

"While on a pilgrimage to Mount Nandishvara for the worship of the Jina, they became detached from the world and thought, 'If we attain human birth, we will perform great austerities, such austerities that will eliminate the suffering associated with womanhood.'" ||127-128||

"Making this vow, they fell from heaven and were born as the daughters of King Srishena of Ayodhya, named Harishena, the elder, and Srishena, the younger, by his wife, Shrikantā. In due time, both of them became beautiful and adorned with the splendor of youth." ||129-130||

"When their Swayamvara was being arranged, they remembered their previous birth and their vow. Abandoning their families, they immediately embraced austerities." ||131||

Hearing the words of Ksanti, the young woman also became detached and, terrified of the world, took initiation from her. ||132||

She spent her time in austerities with other ascetics. Her body became emaciated through the practice of austerities, conducted in accordance with the principles and the time. ||133||

In the Harivamsha Purana, once while seeing Vasantasena, a courtesan surrounded by lustful men, engaged in play during a forest outing, [134] Aryika Sakamarika, with a heavy heart, declared the cause of her ill-repute, saying with great respect, "May I also attain such good fortune in another birth." [135] At the end of her lifespan, she died and became a goddess in the Aranachuta couple, the wife of her previous husband, Somabhuti Deva, with a lifespan of fifty-five palyas. [136] The souls of Somadatta and the other three brothers descended from heaven and were born as sons of Kunti, the wife of Pandu Raja, named Yudhishthira, Bhima, and Arjuna. [137] Similarly, the souls of Dhanashri and Mitrashri also descended from heaven and were born as sons of Madri, the other wife of Pandu Raja, named Nakula and Sahadeva. [138] The soul of the young girl also descended from heaven and was born as a daughter named Draupadi to Dridharatha, the wife of King Drupada. [139] Due to the affection from their previous birth, the union of Draupadi and Arjuna happened in this birth, preceded by Radhoveda. [140] The three elder Pandavas - Yudhishthira, Bhima, and Arjuna - will attain liberation in this birth, and the last two Pandavas - Nakula and Sahadeva - will attain complete fulfillment. [141] Due to the purity of Draupadi's right vision and the fruits of her austerities, she will become a goddess in the Aranachuta couple and then, after experiencing the human cycle, will attain liberation. [142] Hearing this account of their dharma and previous births, the Pandavas, filled with dispassion for the world, attained restraint in the presence of Shri Neminath Jinendra. [143] Kunti, Draupadi, and other women like Subhadra, all stayed engaged in austerities in the presence of Rajimati Aryika. [144] Reflecting on the nature of their souls through right vision, right knowledge, right conduct, the great vows, the assembly, and the secrets, the Pandavas and others performed austerities. [145]

Standing with unwavering devotion, having completed the six types of fasting practices,
The Yogis, led by Yudhishthira, traversed the ocean of Jain scriptures. || 146 ||

Thus ends the sixty-fourth chapter of the Harivamsa, composed by Jinasena Acharya, a part of the Arishta-nemi Purana, which describes the initiation of Yudhishthira and the other five Pandavas. || 64 ||

They had taken the vow to accept food only from the tip of a spear, their bodies weakened by hunger. They completed this rigorous penance in six months, relieving their hearts of all strain. Yudhishthira and the other sages also performed the *vela*, *tela*, and other types of fasts with great devotion. In this way, the sage Bhima, along with Yudhishthira and the other sages, wandered the earth, immersed in the ocean of Jain scriptures. || 146 ||

The Tirthankara, having preached in all the lands, moved from the north towards the land of Saurashtra. [1]

Having crossed the Uttarayana (northern solstice) and entered the Dakshinayana (southern solstice), the brilliance of the Jina remained as pervasive as before. [2]

The Lord, adorned with the glory of the Samvasarana, wandered in the south, and the lands shone like heaven. [3]

At the end, the Jina, who was to attain Nirvana-Kalyanak, ascended Mount Girnar, served by humans, gods, and demons. [4]

As before, the Samvasarana was established there, free from defilement, and filled with humans and gods. [5]

The Jina, seated in the Samvasarana, preached the Dharma, the purifier of the three jewels, the sole means to attain heaven and liberation, and approved by the virtuous. [6]

Just as the Jina, the benefactor of all, had preached the Dharma in detail in his first assembly after attaining omniscience, so too did he preach it in detail in his final assembly. [7]

Just as fire has upward flames and heat, water has coolness, wind has speed, luminous objects like the sun and moon have radiance, space has formlessness, and earth has the capacity to hold things, all by their nature, so too was the preaching of the Jina, who had fulfilled his purpose, natural and not inspired by anyone. [8-9]

Then, the Jina, who suppressed yoga, ended the karmas that lead to rebirth, and attained Nirvana with hundreds of monks. [10]

The four types of Jain gods, led by Indra, performed the rituals of Nirvana-Kalyanak, which are meant for the body. [11]

The Fifty-Sixth Chapter

The bodies of the Tirthankaras, adorned with divine fragrances and flowers, were absorbed into the sky like lightning, illuminating the heavens. || 12 || This is the nature of the atoms of the bodies of the Tirthankaras, that they shed their skandha-paryaya at the end, like lightning in an instant. || 13 || Indra, with his vajra, carved the sacred Siddha-sila on Mount Girnar, adorning it with the qualities of the Jinas. || 14 || Indra and the other gods, along with the kings, paid their respects to the assembly of the monks, led by Varadatta, and then departed to their respective places. || 15 || Samudravijaya and his eight brothers, the six sons of Devaki, and other monks like Shambha and Pradyumna, attained liberation from Mount Girnar. From that time onwards, Girnar and other places of liberation became renowned in the world and were frequented by countless bhavyas on pilgrimage. || 16-17 || 

Knowing of the liberation of the Bhagavan, the five Pandava monks, steadfast in their devotion to the image, remained on Mount Shatrunjaya. || 18 || At that time, a man named Kshuyavarodhana, belonging to the lineage of Duryodhana, resided there. Upon hearing of the arrival of the Pandavas, he was filled with malice and began to inflict severe torments upon them. || 19 || He had heated iron crowns, shackles, and waistbands made and set them ablaze, placing them on their heads and other parts of their bodies. || 20 || The Pandava monks, being valiant and wise in the knowledge of karma, and capable of destroying karma, considered that burning torment as cool as snow. || 21 || Bhima, Arjuna, and Yudhisthira, being absorbed in shukla-dhyana, destroyed all eight karmas and attained liberation. However, Nakula and Sahadeva, seeing the fate of their elder brother, were somewhat troubled in their minds, and therefore were born into the state of Sarvartha-siddhi. || 22-23 ||

In the Harivansh Purana, the great soul Narada, having taken initiation, attained the destruction of the cycle of birth and death and the imperishable liberation through the power of his austerities. ||24||
Many other worthy souls, who were the holders of the three jewels, also attained liberation, and many others who were about to be liberated from the cycle of birth and death, went to heaven. ||25||
Standing on the peak of the high mountain, Baldev also performed various austerities, being determined to destroy the cycle of birth and death. ||26||
He performed fasts for one day, two days, three days, and so on, up to six months, thereby drying up the passions and the body, and nourishing the soul. ||27||
Determined to sustain his life by begging in the wilderness, Baldev Muni wandered through the wilderness, and people saw him, who was like the moon, wandering. ||28||
Hearing the news that Baldev was wandering in the wilderness, the kings of the surrounding areas were disturbed and came there. ||29||
Seeing those kings, who were filled with the poison of doubt and armed with various weapons, Dev Siddharth created a group of lions in that forest. ||30||
Seeing the lions near the feet of the Muni, those kings, realizing the power of the Muni, bowed down and became calm. ||31||
From that time onwards, Baldev Muni became known in the world as Narasimha. He was adorned with a broad chest like a lion, and was accompanied by lion-like attendants. ||32||
After performing austerities for a hundred years, Baldev Muni finally attained samadhi, and as a result, he attained the position of Indra in the Brahma Lok. ||33||
There, in the radiant, jeweled chariot called Padma, which was filled with groups of gods and goddesses, and adorned with palaces and gardens, he was born as a god, just like...
1. The attainment of liberation by Narada is contradictory to other Digambar texts, as they show him going to hell. 'Kalhappia kadaai ghammaraha Vasudevasamakala. Bhava nirya gadi te hinsadoshena gachchanti' Triloksar Gatha 835. || 'Ruttavar aru panihana havami savve ve. Kalahamaha jujjhapia adhogaya Vasudevanva'. || 1470 Tri. Pra.

Just as a great jewel is born in the vast expanse of a great ocean of jewels, so too was the mighty immortal, Bala, born on a bed of soft sand. ||35||

He was instantly complete with the six perfections: speech, mind, body, senses, breath, and nourishment. ||36||

Adorned with clothes and ornaments, he arose from the bed called Sarvatobhadra, like a youth awakening from a blissful sleep. ||37||

As he looked around, he was greeted by the words of the goddesses and gods, filled with affection for him. ||38||

His body, radiating a brilliance surpassing even the moon and sun, filled him with joy. He pondered, "What is this most beautiful land? Who are these joyful people? Who am I? Where was I born? What dharma have I accumulated?" ||39-40||

The chief gods enlightened him, revealing the nature of existence and the knowledge of the cycles of birth and death. With this understanding, he quickly grasped the entirety of his past and future. ||41||

Knowing all his past lives and driven by the desire to help his brother, he received the blessings of the coronation, adorned with all the necessary accoutrements. Having gained the knowledge of the cycles of birth and death, he learned of Krishna's whereabouts and went to the land of Balukaprabha. Seeing his younger brother in distress, he too was filled with sorrow. ||42-43||

As the mighty, powerful god stood there, the inauspicious sounds, smells, tastes, and touches of that place transformed into auspiciousness. ||44||

He said, "Come, Krishna, I am your elder brother, Balarama, the lord of the Brahma-loka. I have come here to you." ||45||

As he attempted to lift Krishna and take him to the heavenly realm, his body melted away like butter. ||46||

Krishna then said, "Oh god, oh brother, what is the point of these futile efforts? Do you not know that all beings experience the fruits of their own actions?" ||47||

In this world, whatever karma one accumulates, that is what one experiences, according to the law of karma. ||48||

In the Harivamsha Purana,
1
If gods are able to give happiness and remove suffering for others, then why don't they destroy their own suffering of death? ||49||
Therefore, brother! Go to heaven and enjoy the fruits of your merit. I too, at the end of my life, will attain the human state, which is the cause of liberation. ||50||
We both will perform austerities in that human state and, by serving the Jina teachings, will destroy our karmas and attain liberation. ||51||
"Yes, do one thing, brother! In the Bharat Kshetra, let people see us both, accompanied by our sons and other relatives, and endowed with great wealth. Let their minds be filled with wonder upon seeing us. ||52||
For the increase of my fame, you should fill the entire Bharat Kshetra with temples containing my images, holding the conch, discus, and mace in their hands." ||53||
The lord of the gods, accepting these words of Baldeva's soul, came to the Bharat Kshetra, having taught him the purity of right faith. ||54||
Being overcome by brotherly love, that god, as instructed by Vishnu, showed everyone the vision of Krishna and Baldeva, seated in a divine chariot. ||55||
And, by building temples of Krishna in cities, villages, etc., he made the world intoxicated with Krishna-related delusion. This is right, because what can't love do? ||56||
Then, having gone to Brahma-loka, the god performed great worship of the Jina, and there, surrounded by a group of women, he began to enjoy the pleasures of the gods. ||57||
3
Sragdhara
Even though he is situated in a high place, he falls to the root of the terrifying hell, he does not enjoy the taste of worldly pleasures, which are the essence of the cycle of birth and death. Due to excessive love, he has forgotten what he learned before, and he acts contrary to it. Therefore, alas! Alas! The love-delusion of people obstructs their happiness of heaven and liberation. ||58||
What is this, brother! He has to experience the same fruit according to the rules. ||48||
Gods, if they are capable of giving happiness and removing suffering for others, then why don't they destroy their own suffering of death? ||49||
Therefore, brother! Go to heaven and enjoy the fruits of your merit. I too, at the end of my life, will attain the human state, which is the cause of liberation. ||50||
We both will perform austerities in that human state and, by serving the Jina teachings, will destroy our karmas and attain liberation. ||51||
Yes, do one thing, brother! In the Bharat Kshetra, let people see us both, accompanied by our sons and other relatives, and endowed with great wealth. Let their minds be filled with wonder upon seeing us. ||52||
For the increase of my fame, you should fill the entire Bharat Kshetra with temples containing my images, holding the conch, discus, and mace in their hands. ||53||
The lord of the gods, accepting these words of Baldeva's soul, came to the Bharat Kshetra, having taught him the purity of right faith. ||54||

And, by building temples of Krishna in cities, villages, etc., he made the world intoxicated with Krishna-related delusion. This is right, because what can't love do? ||56||
Then, having gone to Brahma-loka, the god performed great worship of the Jina, and there, surrounded by a group of women, he began to enjoy the pleasures of the gods. ||57||
Gautama Swami says, "Look! Due to excessive love, this being, even though situated in a high place, falls to the root of the terrifying hell, he does not enjoy the taste of worldly pleasures, which are the essence of the cycle of birth and death. Due to excessive love, he has forgotten what he learned before, and he acts contrary to it. Therefore, alas! Alas! The love-delusion of people obstructs their happiness of heaven and liberation." ||58||
1. The soul of Krishna is of the nature of a Tirthankara with right faith, and this is a strange mention, as it seems to be carrying out the work of wrong faith. 2. Krishna and Baldeva are seated in a divine chariot. 3. Ascend.

The 56th chapter, in the style of the *Sārdūlavikrīḍita*,

In the renowned pilgrimage site of Nemijina, where the delusion-destroying *kevala* knowledge arose, the noble *muni* named Varadatta, endowed with the eye of liberation, was born.
He, the valiant son of Jaratkumāra, the upholder of the lineage of the Harivaṃśa, bore the burden of the kingdom, protecting the prosperity of the earth, like a strong mountain. || 59 ||

Thus ends the 65th chapter of the *Harivaṃśa*, composed by Jinaseṇācārya, a part of the *Ariṣṭanemi Purāṇa*, which narrates the *nirvāṇa* of the Lord Neminātha. || 65 ||

O
May the delusion arising from excessive affection for hindering beings be condemned! || 58 ||

## Chapter Sixty-Six: Lineage and History

**The Reign of Jaratkumara**

When Jaratkumara, the king who subdued all other kings and ruled with an iron fist, ascended the throne, the people showered him with respect and joy filled the land. [1]

The daughter of the Kalinga king was the chief queen of Jaratkumara. She gave birth to a son named Vasudhvaja, who brought happiness to the world and was the flag of the royal lineage. [2]

Jaratkumara, the leader of the Hari-Vansha lineage, entrusted the kingdom to his son and went to the forest to engage in intense penance, a practice befitting the lineage of the righteous. [3]

Vasudhvaja, like the moon, brought joy to his people. He had a son named Suvasu, who was as wealthy as Kubera. Suvasu's son, Bhimavarma, became the protector of Kalinga, and many kings followed in his lineage. [4]

Kapiṣṭa, an ornament of the lineage, was born to Suvasu. His son was Ajātaśatru, followed by Śatruseṇa, Jitāri, and finally, Jitśatru. [5]

O King Śreṇika, do you not know Jitśatru, the husband of the younger sister of Lord Mahāvīra's father, King Siddārtha? He is renowned for his prowess and has conquered countless enemies. [6]

When the birth anniversary of Lord Mahāvīra was celebrated, Jitśatru visited Kuṇḍapura. King Siddārtha of Kuṇḍapura, a man of unparalleled valor, received his dear friend with great honor. [7]

Jitśatru's wife, Yaśodā, gave birth to a virtuous daughter named Yaśodā. Accompanied by many other women, she set out to fulfill her lofty aspirations. [8]

## Chapter Sixty-Six

"When the Lord, the Self-Existent, was engaged in austerities, having obtained the vast vision of liberation, he roamed the earth for the welfare of the world. Leaving the earth, he remained in austerity." (9)

"From this, the austerity of the sage, the fruit of liberation was obtained, and his human existence became meaningful. For, in the world, human existence is the greatest fruit, and it is achieved by obtaining the fruit of liberation through austerity." (10)

"Thus, this story of the Harivaṃśa, renowned in the world, has been told in brief, by the Śreṇika, connected to the tradition of the sixty-three Tirthankaras. May it bring you prosperity." (11)

"The king Śreṇika, adorned with right faith, along with many kings, heard this sacred Purāṇa from the venerable Gautama. He considered his ears blessed, bowed in reverence, and went to his city, filled with joy." (12)

"The gods and Vidyādharas of the four orders, desiring liberation and devoted to the renowned teachings of the right path, circumambulated and paid homage to the Jina, and then went to their respective places." (13)

"The great sage Jitasatru, revered by the great ones, having roamed the earth, finally became free from the bonds of karma and attained the eternal, blissful, imperishable state of liberation." (14)

"The Jina, the hero, continuously enlightened the multitude of worthy beings, and reached the holy city of Pāvā. He resided in the beautiful garden called 'Manoharo-dyāna' there." (15)

"In the fourth age, when three years and eight and a half months remained, on the dark moon day of Kārttika, in the constellation of Svāti, at the time of dawn, naturally, he..." (16)

In the Harivamsha Purana, the Niruddha Yoga, like a thunderbolt, breaks the bonds of the deadly karma. Having attained the state of liberation, Shankar is constantly connected to the bliss of liberation. ||17|| That great Lord, the Maha Mahesvara, the embodiment of the five auspicious qualities, was celebrated by the gods with the fourfold worship of the body, in accordance with the rules, at the time of the great Nirvana of the Siddhasasana. ||18|| At that time, the city of Pavana was illuminated on all sides by the blazing light of the lamps, which were lit by the gods and the asuras. ||19|| Similarly, the kings, led by Srenika, along with their subjects, went to the place of the Nirvana Kalyanak, and the Indra gods, along with the other gods, went to the place of the Nirvana Kalyanak, seeking the three jewels of the Jina. ||20|| From that time onwards, the beings of the world, filled with devotion to the Nirvana Kalyanak, have been celebrating the festival of the famous lamp-lit procession every year in this Bharat Kshetra, with the intention of worshipping the Jinesvara, the embodiment of the power of the Nirvana of the Jina. ||21|| After the Nirvana of the Lord Mahavira, three Kevalins, Gautam, Sudharma, and Jambuswami, appeared in succession after sixty-two years. After them, five Shruta Kevalins, who knew all the past, appeared after a hundred years. ||22|| After that, eleven Munis, who were the holders of the ten pasts, appeared after a hundred and eighty-three years. After them, five Munis, who were the holders of the eleven Angas, appeared after two hundred and twenty years. After that, four Munis, Subhadraguru, Jayabhadraguru, Yashobahu, and Mahapujya Lohayanguru, who were the holders of the famous Acharaanga, appeared after a hundred and eighteen years. ||23-24||

The Sixty-sixth Chapter

This chapter contains the lineage of the great ascetics, starting with Vinayandhara, who possessed the secret scriptures (Guptasruti), the secret sages (Guptarishi), and the great sage (Munishvara) Shivaguapta.  Arhadbali, Mandararaya, Mitraviravi, Baldeva, Mitraka, Singhbala (who was adorned with the three jewels and increasing merit), Veeravit, Padmasena (who held the lotus of virtues), Vyagrahrasta (who was superior in virtues), Nagahasti, Jitadanda, Nandishena, Dipasena, Sri Dharasena (who was a treasure of penance), Sudharmasena, Singh Sena, Sunandishena, Ishvarasena, Sunandishena, Abhayasena, Bhima Sena, Jinasena, and Shanti Sena were all great ascetics.

Following them was Jayasena, who was the holder of the unbreakable six divisions (Shatkhand) and the complete doctrine (Siddhant). He was the knower of the Shatkhandagama, the holder of the scriptures (Shruti) that described the nature of karma, and the conqueror of the senses. His disciple was Amitasena, who was a renowned grammarian, influential, and a traverser of the ocean of the complete doctrine. He was the leader of the pure Punnatagaṇa. He was a lover of the Jina's teachings, a great ascetic, and lived for a hundred years. Amitasena, the chief among the generous, illuminated the earth with his generosity through the gift of scriptures.

Amitasena's elder brother, Kirtisena, was a peaceful, wise, and virtuous monk who spread his penances throughout all directions. I, Jinasena, was his first disciple. With the devotion of Arishta Nemiji, the Jina who enjoys the supreme bliss of liberation, I, Jinasena, the son of Sura, have composed this Harivansha Purana to the best of my ability, with my limited intellect.

## 808

In the Harivansha Purana, renowned for its excellence and blessed with the auspicious fortune of Shiva's grace, the devotion to Nemishvara is evident. This Harivansha tradition, composed by the wise Jinasena Suri, is a testament to his profound intellect. 

If any errors or inconsistencies have crept into this composition due to carelessness, may the learned scholars, well-versed in the Puranas and knowledgeable about the nature and capabilities of beings, rectify them with utmost diligence.

Where is my mind, where is my meager ability, in the face of this magnificent Harivansha, a mountain of noble lineages? My sole desire is to attain merit through this praise of the lineage of the Jinas.

This composition was not born out of a craving for poetic embellishment, nor from a desire for fame, nor from pride in my literary skills, nor from imitation. It was solely born out of devotion to the Jinas.

Twenty-four Jinas are celebrated in this text, along with twelve righteous Chakravartis, nine Balabhadra, nine Narayana, and nine Pratinarayana, making a total of sixty-six Purana-worthy heroes.

Besides these, this excellent Purana also narrates the stories of countless kings, celestial beings, and others who enjoyed the fruits of the four goals of life, all of whom are praised as illustrious figures in this primary Purana.

The countless merits accrued from narrating the Harivansha are immeasurable. May the human beings born in this world, blessed with the fruits of this merit, find their place in the Jina's teachings.

The life story of Nemishvara Jina, illuminating the nature of all beings, both animate and inanimate, is a treasure trove of knowledge. May the wise and learned, who are the true speakers, recite this story, and may the assembled audience, with their ears as vessels, partake in this nectar.

The mere utterance of the Jina's name is a remedy for the afflictions caused by planets and evil spirits. What need is there to speak of the entire life story, which is a destroyer of all sins?

**Sixty-sixth Chapter**

May those with unwavering minds expound this text for the benefit of others and for their own liberation. This text is auspicious for those who perform auspicious deeds and is the best omen for virtuous seekers. ||42||

This scripture, the refuge of the Jinas, is a great remedy, a bringer of peace, and a good omen. I pray to the twenty-four Tirthankaras and their attendant deities, the protectors of the Dharma, who are always devoted to the Jinas, that they may always remain close to the Jina Dharma. May the deities who hold the Chakra Ratna and the lion-mounted Ambika Devi, who reside on Mount Girnar, always remain close to the Jina Dharma, for where they are present, how can obstacles prevail? ||43-44||

Planets, serpents, ghosts, demons, and other harmful beings, who cause obstacles for people, become pacified by the power of the Jina Dharma and its deities. ||45||

Those who devoutly read the Harivansha Purana obtain their desired accomplishments, as well as fame, wealth, and liberation, with little effort. ||46||

May the noble Aryas, who are superior to all others and who are free from pride, spread this Purana throughout the world, overcoming envy, with unwavering strength and unwavering fortitude. ||47||

What need is there for me to pray? For just as mountains, naturally capable of bearing the weight of the world, receive the water released from the clouds, so too do the Munis naturally spread the Dharma throughout the world. ||48||

If you read this, what need is there to speak of its fruits? ||41||

May learned people, with focused minds, expound this text for the benefit of others and for their own liberation. This text is auspicious for those who perform auspicious deeds and is the best omen for virtuous seekers. ||42||

In the Harivamsha Purana, a new Purana, adorned with excellent words, is like a reservoir of ancient knowledge. This Purana, composed of great clouds of learned men, is spread far and wide by the rivers of people, reaching the four oceans. ||49|| May the Jinesvara, who are served by the assembly of gods, whose peaceful rule brings peace to the people, whose pure, unwavering vision of liberation is ever present, and who have seen all the truths, be victorious. ||50|| May the lineage of the Jain Dharma, invincible in debate, be victorious, may there be prosperity and abundance for the people, and may this earth, adorned with excellent crops due to favorable rains every year, be for the happiness of beings. ||51||

In the year seven hundred and five of the Saka era, when Indraayudha ruled the north, Srivallabha, the son of Krishna Raja, ruled the south, the glorious Avanti Raja ruled the east, and the valiant Jayavaraha, the lord of the solar orb, ruled the west, the composition of this Harivamsha Purana was begun in the temple of Sri Parshvanatha, built by King Nanna Raja in the city of Sri Vardhamanapura, which was constantly growing in prosperity. However, the composition was not completed there. A significant portion remained unfinished. Later, in the city of Dostatika, the people, through their excellent worship and praise, completed the lineage of the Haris, the Jain Tirthankaras, in the peaceful abode of peace. ||52||

Just as the earth spreads out, so too will wise men, capable of bearing the burden of the world, naturally spread this Purana across the earth. ||48||

Page #849:
---------------------------
The 66th chapter of the Harivamsha Purana, titled "Description of the Lotus Feet of the Guru," composed by Acharya Jinasena, is complete. This chapter, part of the Arishta-nemi Purana collection, describes the vast Punnat-sangha lineage, descended from those who left behind other sangha lineages.  Sri Jinasena, a poet born into this lineage, attained the Harivamsha Purana, a glorious mountain, for the sake of the three jewels. This mountain, encompassing all directions, stands firm on earth for a long time. 

This Harivamsha Purana, complete with the Arishta-nemi Purana collection, was composed by Acharya Jinasena. 

This commentary on the Harivamsha Purana, composed by Jinasena, is now complete. May it bring joy to the minds of learned people. I humbly request all wise beings to forgive any errors that may have been made in this work. 

This commentary was completed by Pannalal Suri, a disciple of Dayachandra, on the third day of the bright fortnight of the month of Phalguna, in the year 2486 of the Vira Nirvana era, during the first watch of the night, under the auspicious influence of the constellation Tara.

"In the Harivamsha Purana, it is said that the root of evil is delusion, what to speak of the non-existent? 45.153 "He who is under the control of passions burns himself." 611103 "The speaker and the listener of evil, who do not reap the fruit of it, 
"Increase anger, causing harm to oneself and others, which is the root of samsara, and this is for the increase of suffering." 45.156 "Cultivation." 611108 "Abandon false speech, which is arrogant and deceitful, 
"Like a thirsty person who rejects a drop of water, again and again. Embrace truthful speech, which is blameless. 
"Drinking the water of remembrance of the Jinas, one will be freed from the root of suffering." 62.24 "One's own glory, which is vast, full of virtues, and ready, 
"Is difficult to obtain." 62144 "Victorious, here, proclaimed by the wise." 45.158 "A virtuous person makes an effort, fearing evil, 
"What is difficult for virtue?" 46.16 "If fate is cruel, what effort can he make?" 62.64 "Inappropriate time and place do not adorn." 54.6 "Whether happiness or sorrow, who is bound to whom? 
"Those with troubled minds doubt even the Jinas." 55.14 "Whether a friend or an enemy, one's own actions are the truth." 62151 "The mind wanders in the world of its own desires, 
55.23 "Like a sleeping person, unarmed and bowed down. 
"The death of all living beings is certain. 61220 "Free from fear, it flees again and again. Forgiveness is the root, austerity is the burden, anger is the fire that consumes it." 61162 "The body, which is full of suffering, is the means of liberation, even this austerity is corrupted in an instant. 
"They do not kill even their enemies, for they are the wealth of glory." 62.18 "Anger is the four-fold enemy, anger destroys oneself and others." 66.63 "Who does not fall into the ocean of love?" 63020 "Difficult to obtain is the state of being." 61177 "Who here is the external aggressor? 
"In deep or shallow water, when death is near, 
"The good deeds of one's inner self are the protector. Those who are guided by the teachings of the Jinas never become confused." 61096 "The karma of lifespan (Reva) is the cause of one's own protection, 
"By harming another, one creates a birth in the same life. 
"When it is destroyed, it is completely destroyed." 63139 "The sinner, by killing another, is born again and again as an animal." 61.101 "Wealth, like a fickle ear-ring, 
"A being under the control of passions, a killer, becomes a killer in life after life. 
"Associated with loved ones, they are the cause of sorrow and pain. They increase samsara, whether they are a killer or not." 613102 "Life is a bitter drink of death, 
"Thinking, 'I will kill another,' he picks up a piece of iron. 
"A wise person should acquire the nectar of liberation." 63370
