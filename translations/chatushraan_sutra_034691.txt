## Āgama Sūtra 24, Payannāsūtra-1, 'Chatuḥśaraṇa'

**Sūtra**
[24] Chatuḥśaraṇa Payannāsūtra-1-Hindi Translation
**Sūtra-1**
The first essential, called Sāmāyika, is like refraining from sinful activities. The second essential, called Chauvīsattthao, is like the inscription of the qualities of the twenty-four Tirthankaras.
The third essential, called Vandana, is like the veneration of a virtuous Guru. The fourth essential, called Pratikramāṇa, is like the condemnation of the faults committed.
The fifth essential, called Kaussagga, is like the removal of the heavy defilement of the soul, which is like a wound in the heart. The sixth essential, called Pacchakkhāṇa, is like the acceptance of virtues.

**Sūtra-2**
In this Jinaśāsana, through Sāmāyika, the purity of conduct is definitely achieved. This happens by abandoning the path of negligence and adopting the path of non-defilement.

**Sūtra-3**
The purity of vision and conduct is achieved through Chauvīsattthao (Logass). This happens through praise, which is like the narration of the extraordinary qualities of the twenty-four Jinas.

**Sūtra-4**
The purity of knowledge and other virtues is achieved through the third essential, called Vandana, which is like the proper veneration of the Guru Maharaj, who possesses knowledge and other virtues.

**Sūtra-5**
The proper purification of the condemnation of the desire for knowledge and other virtues (both primary and secondary virtues) is called Pratikramāṇa.

**Sūtra-6**
The purification of the transgressions of conduct and other virtues, which have not been purified through Pratikramāṇa, is achieved through the fifth essential, called Kaussagga, which is like a medicine for a wound or a boil, and is done gradually.

**Sūtra-7**
The purification of the transgressions of austerity is achieved through the sixth essential, called Pacchakkhāṇa, which is like the acceptance of virtues. The purification of the transgressions of the conduct of heroism is achieved through all the essentials.

**Sūtra-8**
(1) Elephant, (2) Bull, (3) Lion, (4) Coronation (Lakshmi), (5) Garland, (6) Moon, (7) Sun, (8) Flag, (9) Kalasha, (10) Lotus Pond, (11) Ocean, (12) The mother of a Tirthankara who came from the celestial realm sees a chariot, and the mother of a Tirthankara who came from hell sees a house, (13) A pile of jewels, and (14) Fire. These fourteen dreams are seen by the mother of every Tirthankara when she is pregnant with him.

**Sūtra-9**
I will speak of the study of Chatuḥśaraṇa, which grants liberation, by venerating Mahāvīrasvāmī, who is venerated by the Devas, Chakravartis, and Munīśvaras.

## Āgama Sūtra 24, Payannā Sūtra 1, Chatuḥ Sharaṇa
**Sūtra 10**
Acceptance of the Four Refuges, condemnation of sinful actions, and approval of virtuous deeds, these three are the causes of liberation. Therefore, they are always worth doing.

**Sūtra 11**
The Arihant, Siddha, Sadhu, and Kevali Bhagavan have revealed the Dharma that brings happiness. These four refuges destroy the four states of existence, and a fortunate person can attain them.

**Sūtra 12, 13**
Now, the soul, adorned with the armor of faith in the Tirthankara, shining like the hairs standing on end, with great joy and affection, bows its head, joins its hands, and says accordingly:

"O Arihant Bhagavan, who destroys the enemies like attachment and aversion, who destroys the eight karmas and other enemies, and who destroys the enemies like passions and defilements, be my refuge."

**Sūtra 14**
O Arihant, who renounced worldly wealth, practiced difficult austerities and virtuous conduct, and became worthy of the wealth of perfect knowledge, be my refuge.

**Sūtra 15**
O Arihant, worthy of praise and veneration, worthy of worship by Indra and Chakravarti, and worthy of attaining eternal happiness, be my refuge.

**Sūtra 16**
O Arihant Bhagavan, who knows the thoughts of others, who is worthy of meditation by the masters of yoga and the great kings, and who is a preacher of Dharma, be my refuge.

**Sūtra 17**
O Arihant, who is capable of protecting all beings, who is worthy of truthful speech, and who is worthy of practicing celibacy, be my refuge.

**Sūtra 18**
O Arihant, who sits in the Samavasarana, enjoys the thirty-four perfections, and preaches Dharma, be my refuge.

**Sūtra 19**
O Arihant, who with a single word pierces through the many doubts of beings in a single moment, and who preaches to the three worlds, be my refuge.

**Sūtra 20**
O Arihant Bhagavan, who brings peace to the world with the nectar of your words, who establishes beings in their true nature, and who liberates the world of living beings, be my refuge.

**Sūtra 21**
O Arihant, who possesses extraordinary qualities, whose glory illuminates the ends of the directions like the moon, who is eternal, beginningless, and infinite, I have taken refuge in you.

**Sūtra 22**
O Arihant, who has completely renounced old age and death, who is the refuge of all beings suffering from sorrow, and who brings happiness to the world of the three realms, I bow to you.

## Sutra
Agam Sutra 24, Payannasutra-1, 'Chatuh-Sharan' Sutra-23

**Sutra 24:**
One who has reverence for the Siddha, the Supreme Soul, whose pure form has been revealed through the purification of karma by taking refuge in the Arihant, joins their hands in a gesture of respect, like the stem of a blooming lotus, with a bowed head and says, "I take refuge in the Siddha."

**Sutra 25:**
I take refuge in the Siddha, who has become a Siddha through the destruction of the eight karmas, who is rich in innate knowledge and vision, and who has attained all that is worthy of attainment.

**Sutra 26:**
I take refuge in the Siddha, who resides in the crown of the three worlds, who has attained the supreme abode, Moksha, who is of inconceivable power, who is auspicious, who is in the Siddha state, and who bestows infinite happiness.

**Sutra 27:**
I take refuge in the Siddha, who has uprooted the enemies of attachment and aversion from their roots, who is the direct witness of the Kevalis, who are always useful and have a clear target, who experiences innate happiness, and who is the supreme liberator.

**Sutra 28:**
I take refuge in the Siddha, who despises the enemies of attachment, etc., who burns the karmic seeds, which are like whirlpools, with the fire of complete meditation, who is worthy of the shelter of the Yogeshwar, and who is worthy of being remembered by all beings.

**Sutra 29:**
I take refuge in the Siddha, who has attained supreme bliss, who is like an ocean of virtues, who has completely destroyed the root of existence, who has dimmed the sun and moon with the light of his perfect knowledge, and who has destroyed the duality of attachment, aversion, etc.

**Sutra 30:**
I take refuge in the Siddha, who has attained the supreme Brahman (supreme knowledge), who has attained the rare benefit of liberation, who is free from all kinds of beginnings, who is like a pillar in sustaining the house of the three worlds, and who is without beginning.

**Sutra 31:**
The Bhavy being, who is filled with love due to the Nay (knowledge) and Brahman, which are the causes of the virtues of the Sadhu, who has taken refuge in the Siddha, places their head on the ground and says:

**Sutra 32:**
I take refuge in the Sadhu, who is the relative of the Jiva-loka (six life forms), who has crossed the ocean of misery, who is very fortunate, and who has attained the happiness of liberation through knowledge, etc.

**Sutra 33, 34:**
I take refuge in the Sadhu, who are Kevalis, who have perfect knowledge, who are of vast intellect, who are omniscient, who are Shrutadhar, who are the Acharyas and Upadhyayas of the Jain teachings.

I take refuge in the Sadhu, who are fourteen-purvi, ten-purvi, nine-purvi, who possess twelve angas, who possess eleven angas, who are Jin-kalpi, who are Yathalandi, who are Parihar-vishad, who are of good character, who have attained the knowledge of the Kshira-ashrava, who have attained the knowledge of the Madhyashrava, who have attained the knowledge of the Sambhinna-shrota, who have attained the knowledge of the Kostha-buddhi, who are Charan-muni, who have attained the knowledge of the Vaikriya, and who have attained the knowledge of the Pada-anusari.

## Āgama Sūtra 24, Payannā Sūtra-1, 'Chatuḥśaraṇa'
Sūtra Sūtra - 35
The sage who abandons enmity and opposition, always has a non-hostile attitude, has a very peaceful face, honors the group of virtues, and destroys attachment, let him be my refuge. Sūtra - 36
The muni who breaks the bonds of affection, resides in a changeless state, desires the happiness free from defilements, delights the mind of the virtuous, and delights in the Self, let him be my refuge. Sūtra - 37
The sage who removes objects and passions, abandons the taste of the pleasure of home and wife, is free from joy and sorrow, and is free from carelessness, let him be my refuge. Sūtra - 38
The sage who is free from the faults of violence, etc., has compassion, has vast intelligence like the ocean of self-existence, goes on the path of liberation free from old age and death, and is very virtuous, let him be my refuge. Sūtra - 39
The muni who is free from the mockery of desire, free from the stain of sin, abandons theft, is free from sexual intercourse which is the cause of sin, and has the brilliance of the gem of the virtues of the sage, let him be my refuge. Sūtra - 40
For him who has well-established conduct in sainthood, the Ācāryas, etc., are also called sages. By calling them sages, they have also been accepted in the position of sainthood; for him, let those sages be my refuge.
Sūtra - 41
Having accepted the refuge of the sage, the body adorned with the expansion of the thrill that arises from great joy, speaks in this way to accept the refuge of this Jina-declared Dharma. Sūtra - 42
I accept as refuge that Dharma which was declared by the Kevali Bhagavan, which was obtained by great merit, which perhaps even some fortunate men have not obtained. Sūtra - 43
That Dharma which, by obtaining or not obtaining it, has obtained the happiness of humans and gods, but the happiness of liberation is obtained only by those who obtain Dharma, let that Dharma be my refuge. Sūtra - 44
Let the Jina Dharma, which destroys the defilement of karma, purifies birth, removes unrighteousness, etc., and is beautiful in its results, be my refuge. Sūtra - 45
I accept as refuge the Jina-doctrine, which is not destroyed even in the three periods of time, which alleviates birth, old age, death, and hundreds of diseases, which is like nectar, and which is dear to many. Sūtra - 46
I accept as refuge the Dharma which perfectly pacifies the frenzy of desire, which does not oppose seen and unseen objects, and which is infallible in giving the fruit equal to the happiness of liberation.

## Āgama Sūtra 24, Payannā Sūtra-1, 'Chatuḥśaraṇa'
**Sūtra Sūtra - 47**
I take refuge in the Dharma that prevents descent into hell, is a collection of virtues, and is unshakeable, defeating the enemies of the righteous and the wicked. 
**Sūtra - 48**
I accept the Dharma taught by the Jinas, which is like a beautiful creation of the finest quality, adorned with the best ornaments, and is of great value due to its inherent worth. It destroys the ignorance that is like poverty, a treasure that is hidden. 
**Sūtra - 49**
By accepting the four refuges, the being with a body adorned with gooseflesh, which arises from the good deeds accumulated, and desires the destruction of evil karma due to the condemnation of the sins committed, says: 
**Sūtra - 50**
I condemn the evil deeds, like the transgression of the truth, which are forbidden in the Jina's teachings, both in this life and in other lives. 
**Sūtra - 51**
I condemn the sin of ignorance, which is like blindness in the darkness of falsehood, and the wrong views I have held about the Arhants and others. 
**Sūtra - 52**
I condemn the sins I have committed by being an enemy of the Śruta Dharma, the Sangha, and the Sadhus, and the other sins I have committed in the various categories of sin. 
**Sūtra - 53**
I condemn the sin of causing suffering to other beings, like the pain of separation, in relation to friendship, compassion, and other such things. 
**Sūtra - 54**
I condemn all the sins that I have committed, caused to be committed, or approved of, through mind, speech, and body, which are against the Dharma and impure. 
**Sūtra - 55-57**
The being, with gooseflesh that arises from the good deeds, which destroys the heavy karmic sins through the condemnation of evil deeds, now clearly says:
I approve of the Arhant-hood of the Arhants, the Siddha-hood of the Siddhas, the Āchārya-hood of the Āchāryas, the Upādhyāya-hood of the Upādhyāyas, the excellent conduct of the Sadhus, the renunciation of the world by the Śrāvakas, and the Samyak-dṛṣṭi of the Samyak-dṛṣṭis. 
**Sūtra - 58**
Or, according to the words of the Vītarāga, we approve of all the good deeds done in the three times (past, present, and future) in three ways (through mind, speech, and body). 
**Sūtra - 59**
The being, who always has auspicious results, by practicing the acceptance of the four refuges and other such things, binds the auspicious nature and makes the bound (inauspicious) nature auspicious.

Sutrasutra-60
And then that auspicious result-bearing being who is bound by (auspicious) nature, slow-tasting, makes it intense-tasting, and makes the inauspicious (slow-tasting) nature unbound, and makes the intense-tasting slow-tasting.
Sutra-61
For him, the wise men should always perform this worship in affliction (due to illness etc.), and in non-affliction also, it should be done well in all three times, this worship is the cause of the fruit equal to the acquisition of good deeds.
Sutra-62
He who did not do the four-limbed Jina Dharma (equal to donation, Shiyal, penance and emotion), who did not take refuge in the four types (Arihant etc.), and then who did not pierce the world equal to the four motions, then indeed the human birth is lost. Sutra-63
O being! Thus, meditate on this study, which is the cause of the boundless happiness of welfare and liberation, in three Sandhyas, conquering the great enemy like carelessness.
