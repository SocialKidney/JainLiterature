**Prakashkiy**

The teachings of the Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira, known as **Deshana**, have been classified into four divisions: 1. **Ang**, 2. **Upang**, 3. **Mul**, 4. **Chhed**. These **Agamas** are concisely written in the form of **Sutras** due to their detailed exposition of theoretical, philosophical ideas and the practices of the Shraman and Shramanopasak communities.

Following the vision of the late **Sarvatobhadra Shraddhey Yuvacharya Shri Madhukaramuni Ji Maharaj**, all the **Agamas** of the first three divisions have been published under the guidance of **Sadhviratna Shri Umravkuvarji Maharaj 'Archana'**, with the cooperation of various learned Shramans, other scholars, and supporting Shravaks. Now, we are beginning the publication of the **Agamas** of the fourth division, starting with the **Nishith Sutra**.

The **Nishith Sutra** is considered to be a **Chulika** (supplement) to the **Acharaang Sutra**. This belief is justified because the **Acharaang** provides a comprehensive and multi-faceted discussion of the conduct of the Shraman community, while the **Nishith Sutra** outlines the methods for rectifying any unintentional lapses in that conduct. It serves as a guide for maintaining the purity and reputation of the **Charya**. This description is so extensive that it has been recognized as a separate text. Further details on this subject are provided in the introduction.

The **Nishith Sutra** has been published by various institutions. However, it is not easily accessible or understandable to everyone. In accordance with its established policy, the committee has presented the essence of the text in simple Hindi along with the original text, making it useful for the general public.

The translation, commentary, and editing of this **Sutra** have been done by **Agammanishi Anuyogpravartak Muni Shri Kanhaiyalalji Maharaj 'Kamal'** and **Geetarth Shri Tilokmuniji Maharaj**. The critical introduction has been written by **Upadhyay Shri Devendramuni Ji Maharaj Shastri**. The committee expresses its gratitude and congratulations to these esteemed Shramans.

Finally, we are pleased to announce that the printing of the remaining three **Chhed Sutras**, namely **Dashaashrutaskandha** and others, is almost complete. We are working diligently to complete the remaining tasks as soon as possible. We hope that the committee will achieve its goal of publishing the entire **Agambattisi** in a short time. The first editions of some of the previously published **Pragamas** have become unavailable. Second editions of some of these have already been published, and the printing of the rest is underway. This will ensure that the entire **Pragam** literature is available to readers.

We express our heartfelt gratitude to all our collaborators.

## The Publication of the Arhammas (Aprakashyas)

The primary reason for considering and keeping the Praayashchitta Praaroopak Praagamas as Aprakashyas was to prevent the ineligible or unqualified from reading them, as they might misuse or abuse them. Therefore, keeping them Aprakashya was entirely appropriate.

As long as the Shruta-Parampara (oral tradition) prevailed in the exchange of knowledge of the Agamas, all Agamas remained Aprakashya.

Chanakya, in his self-composed Sutra, states, "Na Lekhya Guptvaarta," meaning, "Do not write what you want to keep secret." The implication is that what is written as a secret does not remain secret and is revealed in some way or another.

"Shatakon Bhidyate Mantra" - what is spoken to six ears spreads everywhere. When there is one speaker and one listener, the matter remains confidential. When there is one speaker and two or more listeners, the speaker's words do not remain confidential, no matter how hard they try to keep them secret.

As long as the Shruta Parampara prevailed, both among the Jains and the Vaidik, the Aprakashya Agamas did not remain Aprakashya. Because even then, there were those who knew their own doctrines and those of others.

Jains studied Jain and non-Jain philosophies, and non-Jains studied Jain philosophy. Therefore, it is clear that the Shruta Parampara existed among both Jains and non-Jains. Even then, the Agamas did not remain Aprakashya.

Due to the influence of the Avasarpini Kala (period of decline), the power of perception or memory gradually weakened, leading to the writing of Agamas and scriptures. As the writing of Agamas progressed, the Praayashchitta-proponent Agamas were also written, making the Aprakashya Agamas Prakashya (published). With the advancement of the printing era, the Aprakashya Agamas became even more Prakashya.

The main reason for not publishing Hindi translations of the Praayashchitta-related Agamas written in Sanskrit or Prakrit is to keep them secret from the general public. However, those who are intensely curious will try their best to satisfy their curiosity.

Since the Hindi translations of the four Agamas, including Nishitthadi, are currently unavailable, the Praagam Prakashan Samiti, sponsored by the late Yuvaacharya Shri Mishrimalji M. Sa. "Madhukarji," has published all four Agamas.

---------------------------
Yuvacharya Shri, after reviewing the Dasha and Kapp व्यवहार edited by me, sent a message to re-edit the four Dhagamas, Nishochadi, etc. However, due to my poor health for a long time, I requested Shri Tilokamuni Ji M. to translate and write a commentary on the four Agamas. You, with a generous heart, have written the translation and commentary in your own language - even ordinary literate people can easily understand the Prāyaścitta vidhānas by studying them.

Upāśrāya Shri Pushkaramuni Ji, despite being constantly engaged in the physical service of Upāchārya Shri, has performed an unparalleled Shruta Seva by writing the role of Nishītha. For this, all knowledgeable readers and all the workers of the Agama Committee are deeply grateful.

In the work of revision and editing of Nishītha and the other four Agamas, I have continuously received ample cooperation from Shri Vinayamuni Ji and Mahasati Ji Shri Mukti Prabhaji, etc. Therefore, I am deeply grateful to all of them.

##  Praakchhan

The location of the Nishīthasūtra in the Prāgamas

Among the available Āgamas, four Āgamas are designated as Chhedasūtras. This designation is not Āgama-era, meaning it is not found in any Āgama like the Nandī Sūtra, etc. Therefore, this designation was given after Devaddiggani Kṣamāśramaṇa, i.e., a thousand years after the Vīra Nirvāṇa, and has been passed down through tradition until today.

There are many variations in the order of these Chhedasūtras. In some places, the Daśāśruta-skandha is given the first place, while in others, the Vyavahārasūtra is given the first place.

The study of the Vyavahārasūtra makes it clear that among these four Chhedasūtras, the Nishīthasūtra holds the first place in terms of study, followed by the Daśā-Kappa-Vyavahāra in order.

The Prāgama-puruṣa-creating Pūrvaāchāryas and the scholars who wrote a concise introduction to the 45 Āgamas have also given the Nishīthasūtra the first place among the Chhedasūtras.

**Determining the origin of the Nishīthasūtra based on the Āgamas**

The creators (Niyūṇḍhakartā) of the Daśāśruta-skandha, Bṛhatkalpa, and Vyavahārasūtra are the fourteen Pūrva-bhādrābāhusvāmi, but there are many options regarding the creation of the Nishīthasūtra. This is a result of the confusing atmosphere of historians and thinkers. Based on that historical material, even today, investigative scholars do not have the right to definitively say, "The Nishīthasūtra is the creation of such and such an Āchārya."

The reality is something else. If we decide based on the contemplation of the Āgama texts, separate from historical tradition, then it can be a solid and authentic decision.

The tradition of calling this sūtra "quoted from the Pūrva" is not in accordance with the sūtra. The reason for this is that the fourteen Pūrva-bhādrābāhusvāmi created the Vyavahārasūtra, which is undisputed. In that sūtra, he has not mentioned the name "Nishīthasūtra" even once. He has mentioned the name "Āchāraprakalpa" or "Āchāraprakalpa-adhyayana" sixteen times. Studying and memorizing this is essential for every qualified sādhū-sādhvī. Sādhū-sādhvī who do not memorize this are prohibited from attaining the positions of Sanghāḍā-pramukh or Āchārya, Upādhyāya, etc., and young sādhū-sādhvī who forget it are considered worthy of atonement.

From the many descriptions of the Prāgama, it is clear that sādhvī are not taught the Pūrvaśruta. While Āchārya Bhādrābāhusvāmi has clearly stated in the Vyavahārasūtra that sādhvī should memorize and remember the Āchāraprakalpa. 

Page #14:
---------------------------
This clearly shows that even before the fourteenth century, the "Acharaprakalpa" or Pracharaprakalpa-study existed, which was not in the Purvas but in the Angasutras and it was also necessary for the Sadhvis to memorize it. If they forgot, they also had to do penance.
Therefore, it is appropriate to consider as true the description of this session as the study of the Acharanga, written by the Ganadhar, which is found in the Sutras, their commentaries and in the scriptures. It is not in accordance with the Agamas to give importance to other historical alternatives.
Acharaprakalpa in the Agamas
Even before the fourteenth century, the study of Pracharaprakalpa was essential for every Sadhu-Sadhvi of the Jinasasana, the introduction of which is found in the Sutras and their commentaries, which is the indicator of the present available Nishitasutra, such as
(1) Panchvihe Ayarapakappe Pannatte, Tam Jaha-1. Masie Uggahie, 2. Masie Anuggahie, 3. Chaumasie Uggahie, 4. Chaumasie Anuggahie, 5. Arovana.

Isse Spashta Hai Ki Pragamon Mein Nishit Ko Acharangasutra Ka Hi Vibhag Ya Adhyayan Bataya Gaya Hai.
The conclusion is that if we give prominence to the Agamic descriptions and make the historical references secondary, then it can be easily understood that "Nishit-adhyayan" was the name of a study of the Acharangasutra. In it, twenty Uddeshak
1. In matters where the decision is clear from the Agamic description, it is not legal to get entangled with history or tradition. It is appropriate to resolve the matter with the supporting elements of the Pragamanit subject.

There are many objectives available in the study of Acharanga even today. There were three divisions of those 20 objectives - (1) Laghu (2) Guru (3) Aroopana.
These three are combined with the 25 studies of Pracharanga and are called 28 Acharaprakalp in Samavayangasutra.
When it was separated, it was separated from Pracharanga, so it was named Acharaprakalp. This name was famous during the time of Acharya Bhadrabahu, so he has made many provisions in Vyavaharsutra in the name of Acharaprakalp. In Anga Agamas like Samavayanga, Prashnavyakaran etc., description is available in the name of "Acharaprakalp".
Acharaprakalp and Nishoth: Name Change
The Agam calculation given in Nandi Sutra does not have the name Acharaprakalp, but it has the name Nisheeth, and in Vyavaharsutra, there is no name Nisheeth, but the name Acharaprakalp is many times. Vyavaharsutra was composed earlier and Nandi Sutra was composed hundreds (800) years later. This makes it clear that this Sutra was in the name of Acharaprakalp in front of Bhadrabahu Swami and after him, till Devadhigani, the name Acharaprakalp of that Sutra could not remain famous, but the original name of the study of Acharanga, which was Nisheeth study, got fame in the form of Nisheeth Sutra and Sri Devavachka Pavibhushith Devadhigani Kshamasraman, the creator of Nandi, gave place to that famous name.
The implication is that in the beginning, this study of Pracharanga was in the name of "Nisheeth-study". In front of Bhadrabahu Swami, it was in the name of Pracharaprakalp or Acharaprakalp-study and after him, it got fame in the name of Nisheeth Sutra. Even then, many provisions made in the name of Pracharaprakalp in the original text of Vyavaharsutra are still present in the same form and on the basis of that, appointment, commentary, and commentary are also present.
Appointment, commentary, commentary, etc. commentators have accepted Nisheeth Sutra or Nisheeth-study including Acharanga in the name of "Pracharaprakalp".
Alternative Five Names
Call it the study of Acharangasutra, call it Pracharaprakalp or Acharaprakalp-study or Nisheeth Sutra, all are synonyms of Nisheeth Sutra. Their number is five, namely
1. Study of Acharangasutra - "Nisihajzhayana", 2. Acharaprakalp-study, 3. Acharaprakalp (Sutra), 4. Nisheeth Sutra, 5. Panchama Chala of Acharangasutra.
Thus, this scripture has a changing name from time to time. After the creation of Nandi Sutra, its name "Nisheeth Sutra" became certain, which is still going on.
Explanations - Explainer and Explanation Time
The second Bhadrabahu Swami has done an explanation called appointment on this Sutra. On the basis of Sutra and appointment, Acharya Siddhasenagani did an explanation called commentary, this has been directed many times by Charnikar. According to another opinion, Acharya Sanghadasagani is also said, but this statement is not so important according to Chani.
(13)

Page #16:
---------------------------
Based on the Sutras, the Niyukti, and the Bhashya verses, a commentary called Chani was written by Acharya Jinadasagani Mahattar. This commentary, along with the Bhashya and the Niyukti, was published from Agra. The authors of this publication are Kavi Pandit Ratna Shri Amarmuniji M. Sa. and Pandit Ratna Shri Kanhaiyalalji M. Sa. "Kamal". All three commentaries are in Prakrit language. The Chani is a prose commentary, while the Bhashya and the Niyukti are verse commentaries.

The Niyuktikar lived in the eleventh century after the Nirvan of the Tirthankaras. His brother was Varahamihira, who wrote the "Varahi Samhita" text, which mentions the time of its composition. Based on the same era, the time of Bhadrabahu Swami and Varahamihira is known, which is the sixth century of the Vikram era and the eleventh century after the Nirvan of the Tirthankaras, i.e., 30-40 years after the time of Devadhigani Kshamashraman, which is the year 562 of the Vikram era. Subsequently, the Bhashyakar lived in the seventh century of the Vikram era and the Chunikar lived around the eighth century.

Thus, the commentary literature of this Sutra is at least 1300 years old.

A Sanskrit commentary on this Sutra was written in this 21st century by Shrimad Jainacharya Agamoddhara Pandit Ratna Shri Ghasilalji M. Sa.

The original text has been translated into Hindi and Gujarati by Shrimad Jainacharya Pragamoddhara Pandit Ratna Shri Amolkrishiji M. Sa. and other scholars from time to time. However, this is the first attempt to edit the original text and its translation with commentary and explanation in Hindi. The basis of the commentary and additional statements

This edition of the Nishisutra is primarily based on the Niyukti, Bhashya, and Chani. In editing the original text and interpreting the meaning of the Sutra, many available manuscripts have been considered secondary, and the Niyukti, Bhashya, and Chani have been given priority. The commentaries have also been given priority in the commentary, however, in some places, the Agam Prashayas have been given priority, and the commentary has been made different or contrary to these commentaries. This has also been done in some places in the Vyavahar Sutra in addition to the Nishisutra, all of which are as follows:

(1) Nishisutra U. 2 Su. 1 "Padaponchan" (2) Nishisutra U. 2 Su. 8 "Visuyavei" (3) Nishisutra U. 3 Su. 73 "Golehaniasu" (4) Nishisutra U. 3 Su. 80 "Anuggae Suriye" (5-6) Nishisutra U. 19 Su. 1 and 6 "Viyad" and "Galei" (7) Vyavahar U. 2 "Atthajay" (8) Vyavahar U. 3 Su. 1-2 "Ganadharan" (9) Vyavahar U. "Sodiyasala" (10) Vyavahar U. "Tivasa Pariyae" (11) Vyavahar U. "Palasgansi" (12-13) Vyavahar U. Su. 9-10 "Niruddha Pariyae, Niruddhavas Pariyae"
"
"

Page #17:
---------------------------
The primary reason for differentiating the meaning and interpretation of these words from ancient commentaries is to correctly understand the intent of the Agamas. For specific information, one should carefully study the marked passages. There, an attempt has been made to clarify the subject and intent with reasons and Agamic evidence.

**The Imposition of Ācāra-prakalpa and Prāyaścitta**

In the Samavāyāṅgasūtra, twenty-eight types of Prāyaścitta imposition are also called Ācāra-prakalpa. The reason for this is that these 28 Prāyaścitta impositions are also related to the study of Ācāra-prakalpa, hence they are called Ācāra-prakalpa.

There is some distortion in the original text of the 28 types of imposition due to a scribal error, which even the commentators have not discussed.

There, the imposition begins with one month and five days and ends with four months and twenty-five days. This way of starting in the middle and ending in the middle does not seem appropriate.

In reality, one should start with the Prāyaścitta-imposition of five nights and then perform six options for one month and twenty-four options for four months. This method and order of giving Prāyaścitta is also clearly evident from the Bhāṣya and other commentaries. However, there is no basis for starting with one month and five days and going up to four months and twenty-five days, and then performing twenty-four bhangas. There is also no explanation for the reason behind it. Therefore, it is appropriate to perform twenty-four options from five days to four months. Even in the Niśīth, Prāyaścitta-sthāna are mentioned for four months, and in the commentaries, the imposition begins from five days. The last four options after twenty-four options are undisputed - (1) Laghu (2) Guru (3) Saṃpūrṇa (4) Apūrṇa. Thus, a total of twenty-eight Ācāra-prakalpa are mentioned. In expectation, the study and divisions of the Ācārāṅga and Niśīthasūtra are also called twenty-eight Ācāra-prakalpa.

**The Main Subject of the Niśīthasūtra**

This Chhedasūtra primarily deals with the amount of Prāyaścitta for each fault if someone criticizes themselves for violating the limits of restraint due to unavoidable reasons or without any reason. It is divided into twenty sections as follows:

The first section outlines the faults that are eligible for Guru-māsika Prāyaścitta. Sections 2 to 5 outline the faults that are eligible for Laghu-māsika Prāyaścitta. Sections 6 to 11 outline the faults that are eligible for Guru-cāumāsika Prāyaścitta. Sections 12 to 19 outline the faults that are eligible for Laghu-cāumāsika Prāyaścitta. The twentieth section describes the method of giving and bearing Prāyaścitta.

The purification of Atikrama, Vyatikrama, and Atichāra is achieved through the minor Prāyaścitta of Ālocanā and Micchāmi Dukkadam. The Niśīthasūtra-prescribed Prāyaścitta is for the consumption of Anācāra-doṣa. This is the limit for ordinary Sādhu who are Sthavira-kalpi.

Those who are Jinakalpī or Pratimādhārī, etc., who are special Sādhu, also have to perform the Guru Prāyaścitta prescribed by the Niśīthasūtra for Atikrama, etc.

1. The **Lahu-masik** penance for minor offenses is one **ekasana** (fasting for one day) for the least severe and 27 **upavasas** (fasting days) for the most severe.
2. The **Guru-masik** penance for minor offenses is one **nivi** (two **ekasanas**) for the least severe and 3 **upavasas** for the most severe.
3. The **Lahu-chaumasik** penance for minor offenses is one **ayambil** (or one **ekasana**) for the least severe and 108 **upavasas** for the most severe.
4. The **Guru-chaumasik** penance for minor offenses is one **upavasa** (four **ekasanas**) for the least severe and 120 **upavasas** for the most severe.
5. Repeatedly performing the penances for these offenses or performing them for a long time increases the severity of the **tapa-prayaschitta** (penance), which can even be increased to **diksha-ched** (excommunication).
6. If a practitioner hides a major offense by secretly performing it and another person reveals the offense and proves it, then the practitioner receives the penance of **diksha-ched**.
7. If someone else proves the offense and the practitioner, through excessive deceit and hypocrisy, acts contrary to the truth or even accuses the accuser falsely, but then, when forced, admits to the offense and agrees to perform the penance, then they are given the penance of **new diksha** (initiation).
8. If they remain in their stubbornness and refuse to admit to the offense, then they are expelled from the **gachch** (community).
9. The secrecy of the **sutras** (texts): No knowledge or **agama** (scripture) is completely secret, but there are limits to its disclosure.
10. The **mala agamas** (secondary scriptures) do not mention any **sutra** as being secret. They only state that a qualified disciple should be taught the **sutras** and their meaning (**paramarth**) in a sequential manner.
11. An unqualified or unprepared person should not study any scripture, because according to **Nishita-sutra** (a scripture) **uddeshak 19**, the teacher who teaches them will receive penance. Similarly, if qualified and virtuous disciples are not taught in a sequential manner, then they also receive the penance mentioned in the **sutras**.
12. Thus, it is clear that no **agama** is secret except for qualified **sadhus** (monks) and **sadhvis** (nuns).
13. The **agamas** mention that **sadhvis** should study eleven **anga-sutras** (canonical texts) out of the twelve, while **sadhus** should study all twelve **angas**. **Shravakas** (laymen) are also mentioned as studying the **shruta** (scripture) and its **upadhan** (application).
14. During the time of the **tirthankaras** (liberated souls), only the **dwadasangi shruta** (twelve-part scripture) existed. The compilation of the remaining **sutras** occurred over time, which is undeniable.
15. Thus, even though the **agamas** are considered secret, during the time of the **tirthankaras**, the **anga shastras** (canonical texts) were studied by the **sadhu**, **sadhvi**, **shravaka**, and **shravika** (fourfold community).
16. The **Vyavahar Sutra** (a scripture) written by **Bhadra-bahu** (a Jain scholar) in the **Chaudas-purvi** (fourteenth century) also emphasizes the importance of studying and teaching **prachar-prakalpa** (practical conduct). It states that every young **sant** (saint) and **sati** (saintly woman) must memorize it, which suggests that its secrecy is not absolute. Thus, the study of **Nishita-sutra** or other **sutras** was also prevalent in the fourfold community in ancient times.
17. Over time, the era of **agama-lekhan** (scriptural writing) came, followed by the era of **vyakhya-lekhan** (scriptural commentary), and now the era of **prakasha-yug** (publication). The writing and publication of **agamas** has occurred and continues to occur over time. Written and published copies of these scriptures exist in India and abroad.

The propagation of [the secret] has taken place. Therefore, the statement that has been prevalent about confidentiality has now become merely a statement.
For a worthy Sadhu-Sadhvi, even the Cheda Sutra, let alone other Agamas, are not confidential; rather, it is no exaggeration to say that without studying the Cheda Sutras or understanding their ultimate meaning, the Sadhaka's practice is incomplete, crippled, and dependent, and without their most subtle study, the Sangha system is completely dark.
Without studying the ultimate meaning of the Cheda Sutras, Shraman Shramani cannot become even a lowly Bahushruta, and without being a lowly Bahushruta, they can always wander in dependence. They cannot hold any kind of prominence, cannot wander freely and roam, and always live their lives based on the decisions and foundations of others. For those who bear the burden of the Sangha system, it is absolutely necessary to understand these Cheda Sutras and their ultimate meaning.
Keeping these many perspectives in mind, this Hindi edition of the Cheda Sutras with commentary has been prepared. It is hoped that this will provide multifaceted guidance to ordinary Sadhakas and especially to those holding the position of Singhada and other such dignitaries.
Param Pujya Shraddhey Shri Kanhaiyalalji M. Sa. "Kamal" took my help in this important work of editing the Cheda Sutras and gave me the unparalleled opportunity of serving the Agamas, for which I am deeply grateful to him. His kindness cannot be forgotten in my lifetime.
Finally, if any kind of linguistic or typographical error has occurred in this editing collaboration due to ignorance or misunderstanding, I offer "Micchami Dukkadam" from the heart. I also hope that learned readers will forgive me for these mistakes, considering that "only the hidden is prone to error," and will accept the correct truth as per the Agamas.

Nishishasa: A Critical Study
-Upadhyay Shri Devendramuni

Jain Agam literature holds a unique place in Indian literature. The word Agam is derived from the prefix 'A' and the root 'Gam'. 'A' means complete and 'Gam' means motion or attainment. In Acharang Sutra, the word Agam is used in the sense of knowing. In Bhagavati Anuyogdwar and Stananga, the word Pragam is used in the sense of scripture. The great Mahamanishis have written various definitions of the word Agam. It is not possible to quote all those definitions here. In the commentary of Syadvadamanjari5, the definition of Agam is as follows: 'Aaptvakan is Agam. By treatment, Aaptvakan-born knowledge is also Pragam.' Acharya Malayagiri has written: 'That which gives complete knowledge of objects with limitations is Agam.' In Ratnakaraavtarika Vritti, the definition of Agam is: 'That which gives true knowledge of objects is Agam.'8 Jinabhadragani Kshamasraman has written while defining Agam: 'That which gives the right education is called scripture Agam or Shrutajnana.'

Pragam literature is the nectar of the thoughts of omniscient-all-seeing great men. This Agam literature is as vast and vast as the body of letters, it is even more adorned with the dignity of meaning. Where there is a predominance of philosophical thought, a profound analysis of Dravyanuyog, there is also a detailed description of the conduct and thoughts of Shramans and Shravaks, vows-restraint, renunciation-penance, fasting, atonement, etc. There is also proper use of stories to clarify the guru-serious secrets of religion and philosophy. In addition to these, the living

This text is a detailed description of the Jain scriptures known as "Cheda Sutras". Here's a translation preserving the Jain terms:

**The Symbolism**

This text is a detailed account of the birth, austerities, teachings, and travels of the Tirthankaras, starting with Lord Mahavira. It also describes the lineage of disciples, the boundaries of the Arya and Anarya regions, and the contemporary kings, princes, and other religious sects. The ancient Jain scriptures (Agamas) infused a new consciousness into every aspect of life. They presented a vibrant and realistic perspective on life, stating that the goal of life is not to get entangled in worldly desires, but to illuminate life through renunciation, detachment, and self-control. This is why the Jain Agamas constantly inspire the seeker to practice self-control, austerities, devotional practices, and introspection.

**The Cheda Sutras**

Acharya Devavachana, in the Nandi Sutra, divided the Agamas into two parts: Anga-Pravesht and Anga-Bahya. The Cheda Sutras are part of the Anga-Bahya Agamas. The Cheda Sutras provide a detailed analysis of the rules of conduct for Jain monks and nuns. This analysis was originally presented by Lord Mahavira himself, making it unique and extraordinary.

Later Acharyas further developed these rules. The Cheda Sutras analyze various methods of atonement that monks and nuns must follow when they break the rules. The Cheda Sutras were created to maintain the purity and integrity of monastic life. Therefore, studying the Cheda Sutras is not only necessary but also mandatory for the proper conduct of monastic life.

**The Origin and Classification of Cheda Sutras**

The term "Cheda Sutra" first appears in the "Aavashyak Niyukti". It is not found in any earlier ancient literature. Later, Acharya Jinabhadragani Kshamashraman mentioned the Cheda Sutras in the "Vishesh Aavashyak Bhashya", and Sanghadasagana mentioned them in the "Nishith Bhashya". The reason for classifying the Cheda Sutras separately and including the "Nishith" and other texts under them is not explicitly explained. It is clear that the texts we call Cheda Sutras are primarily atonement scriptures. The terms "Vyavahar", "Aalocana", "Shodhi", and "Prayashchitta" are considered synonyms in the "Vyavahar Bhashya". Based on this, the Cheda Sutras can be called "Vyavahar Sutras", "Aalocana Sutras", "Shodhi Sutras", and "Prayashchitta Sutras". Acharya Malayagiri used the terms "Padavibhag" and "Samachari" for the Sutras in the "Aavashyak Niyukti" commentary. Both "Padavibhag" and "Cheda" convey the same meaning. It is possible that the Cheda Sutras were named after this concept.

**The Structure of Cheda Sutras**

The Cheda Sutras are independent of each other. Each Sutra is self-contained. The interpretation of these Sutras is also done from the perspective of "Cheda" or "Vibhag".

We have already written in the previous lines that the Chhed-Sutras are called Prayashchitta-Sutras. In the Sthananga, five characters are mentioned for the Shramans - 1. Samayik, 2. Chhedopasthapanik, 3. Pariharavishuddhi, 4. Sukshmasampray, 5. Yathakyat'. Of these, the last three characters have become extinct in the present time. The Samayik character is short-lived, the Chhedopasthapanik character lasts for life. The Prayashchitta is also related to this character. It is possible that the Prayashchitta-Sutras were given the name Chhed-Sutras keeping this character in mind.
The Dasha-Shruta-Skandha, Vyavahar and Brihatkalpa Sutras are mentioned in the ninth Pratyakhyan. It is also possible that they were given the name Chhed-Sutras because they were cut off from the ninth Pratyakhyan, i.e., separated.
In the seventeenth Sutra of the nineteenth Uddeshak of the Nisihtha-Sutra, the Chhed-Sutra is called 'Uttamashrut'. Sanghadasagani has considered the Chhed-Sutra as Uttamashrut in the Nisihtha-Bhashya. Jinadasagani Mahttar has raised this question in the Nisihtha-Churni and again he himself has solved the question by writing that the Chhed-Sutra clarifies the character by describing the Prayashchitta-vidhi, therefore the Chhed-Sutras are called Uttamashrut.
Thinking about the word Uttamashrut, a curiosity arises in the mind that is the Chhed-Sutra not 'Chhek' Sutra? Chhekshrut means Kalyanashrut and Uttamashrut. In the Churni of the Dasha-Shruta-Skandha, the Dasha-Shruta-Skandha is considered the main text of the 'Chhek' Sutra. The Dasha-Shruta-Skandha is not a Prayashchitta-Sutra. It is an Achar-Sutra. Therefore, the Dasha-Shruta-Skandha is taken in the Charan-Karan-Anuyog in the Dasha-Shruta-Skandha-Churni. Even if the Chhed-Sutra is considered as the Chhek-Sutra, there can be no objection. In the Dashavaikalik-Sutra of Acharya Shayambhav - "Jan Chheyan Tam Samayare" 7 words are obtained. Here, the word Chhey confirms the existence of Chhek.
In the Digambar tradition, two divisions of Agam literature have been made in the Shatkhandagam, 6 Sarvarth Siddhi, 10 Tattvarth Rajavartika, 11 Gommatsar Jivakand 12 etc. - Angabahy and Angapravesh. But in these, Chhed is this

The type of division is not available. But in later texts, the names Chhedashastra and Chhedapinda are found. It is possible that the word Chhed was used in the Digambar tradition in the sense of atonement. Both Chhedashastra and Chhedapinda are texts that describe atonement. Chhedapinda mentions eight synonyms for atonement (1) Prayashchitta, (2) Chhed, (3) Malaharan, (4) Papnashan, (5) Bodhi, (6) Puny, (7) Pavitra, (8) Pavan. Chhedashastra also accepts both Prayashchitta and Chhed as synonyms. In short, Chhedasutra are Prayashchittasutra.

In Samachari Shatak, Acharya Samaysundaragani has mentioned six Chhedasutras - (1) Dasha Shruta Skandha, (2) Vyavahar, (3) Brihatkalpa, (4) Nishita, (5) Mahanishita, (6) Jitakalpa. Out of these, the names of five or six Sutras have been mentioned by Acharya Devavachka in Nandi Sutra. Scholars believe that Jitakalpa is the work of Jinabhadragani Kshamasraman. The time of Jinabhadragani Kshamasraman is around 650 CE. Its creation is after the creation of Nandi Sutra. Therefore, it cannot be given a place in the category of Agam. Mahanishita Sutra was destroyed by termites. Therefore, its original copy is not available at present. Acharya Haribhadrasuri had restored it. Therefore, the Mahanishita available at present does not come under the category of Pragam. Thus, there are four original Chhedasutras - (1) Dasha Shruta Skandha, (2) Vyavahar, (3) Brihatkalpa, (4) Nishita.

Nishita has a prominent place in Chhedasutras. Nishita means unilluminated. This Sutra is full of exceptions. Therefore, it was not taught to everyone. Jindasagani Mahत्तर has mentioned three types of readers - (1) Aparinamka, (2) Parinamka, (3) Atiparinamka. Aparinamka means whose intellect is immature. Parinamka means whose intellect is mature. Atiparinamka means whose intellect is full of fallacies. Both Aparinamka and Atiparinamka are not eligible to read Nishita. The reader who can hold the secret for life is the enlightened reader who is eligible to read Nishita. The word secret here reveals its confidentiality. Only the sadhu who has been initiated for three years and has qualities like seriousness can study Nishita. A sixteen-year-old sadhu with hair on the side of his eyes can be the reader of Nishita.

Page #25:
---------------------------
No Shraman can go to his relatives for alms without knowing the Nishītha, nor can he be considered worthy of the position of Upadhyaya, etc. Knowledge of Nishītha is also essential for leading the Shraman community and for independent travel. Because without knowing Nishītha, no Sadhu can be entitled to perform atonement. Therefore, Nishītha has been presented as a standard in the Vyavahārasūtra.
There are two types of Chhedasūtras. Some Chhedasūtras come under the Anga, while others come under the Angabāhya. Nishīthasūtra is under the Anga and other Chhedasūtras are under the Angabāhya. Although Āchārya Devavāchak has not mentioned the mutual relationship between Āchārānga and Nishītha. There is only mention of the twenty-five chapters of Āchārānga.4 In the Samavāyāngasūtra, nine chapters of Prāchārānga and sixteen chapters of Āchārchūla have been described as twenty-five chapters of Āchārānga.5 In the Nandīsūtra, Nishītha has been described as an independent Kālikasūtra. But it has not been counted in the twenty-five chapters of Prāchārānga.6 It is possible that Āchārya Devavāchak may not have had the notion that Nishītha is a Chūla of Prāchārānga. In the Samavāyāngasūtra, 85 Uddeshanakālas of Āchārāngasūtra have been mentioned along with Chūlikā. Āchārya Abhaydeva, the commentator of Navāṅgī, has indicated the fulfillment of the number presented up to the fourth Āchārchūla. It is as follows

This excerpt clearly shows that there is no connection between the Acharaanga and the Nisiitha. The 57 studies of the Samavayanga have established the 57 studies of the Praacharaanga, Sutra-krtaanga, and Staanaanga. Nisiitha is not included there either.
The Acharaanga-niyukti first gives us information about the connection between the Acharaanga and the Nisiitha. By creating a joint appointment of the Acharaanga and the five Chulaas, a relationship has been established between the Praacharaanga and the Nisiitha. The Niyaktkaara has established the Nisiitha as the fifth Chulaa of the Acharaanga, proving that both the Praacharaanga and the Nisiitha are Angas.
In short, the summary is that the Nisiitha was established as the fifth Chulaa of the Praacharaanga after the Nandi-sutra and before the creation of the Niyukti.
Pandit Dalasukh Bhai Malvaniya has elaborated on this question in his book 'Nisiitha: A Study' and has presented the view that 'Nisiitha' would have been part of the Acharaanga at some point. But there was a time when the Nisiitha was separated from the available Acharaanga-sutra. It should also be remembered that the Nisiitha was the last Chulaa of the Acharaanga, not the original. It is possible that it was added to the Praacharaanga as a Chulaa at some point and, due to special circumstances, the Nisiitha, which was not originally part of the Praacharaanga, remained an appendix. The Nisiitha was included in the Cheda Anga-baahya. Including the Nisiitha in the Anga-baahya did not diminish its importance. Here too, it must be remembered that only the Shvetambara tradition considers the Nisiitha-sutra to be part of the Praacharaanga, not the Digambara tradition. From the Digambara tradition's perspective, the Nisiitha is an Anga-baahya Agama text.2 The Digambara tradition has considered fourteen texts to be Anga-baahya. Of these, six are studies of the Aavashyak-sutra. This also makes it clear how ancient the Nisiitha Agama is. It is self-evident that the Nisiitha-sutra existed before the division of the Shvetambara and Digambara traditions. The following verse appears in the Acharaanga-niyukti:
Navabambachearamaio attaraaspayasahaassiyo veo.
Havai ya sapanchchulo bahu-bahutaro payaggen. ||3 This verse makes it clear that earlier there were only nine Brahmacharya studies in the first Skandha of the Acharaanga. After that, it increased and became the first Bahu and then Bahutara. Based on the Acharaanga, the first four Chulaas were created and these Chulaas were added to the Acharaanga. The introduction of the Acharaanga in both the Samavayanga and the Nandi Agamas mentions twenty-five studies, but the Nisiitha is not included with it. When the Nisiitha was added to the Acharaanga, it became Bahutara from Bahu. The Nisiitha was added to the Acharaanga between the time of the creation of the Agama-soochi mentioned in the Nandi and the time of the creation of the Acharaanga-niyukti.

This natural curiosity may arise - based on the object called "Purvagata Achar", Nishita was created or established, its name was "Acharprakalp". Due to the similarity of the subject matter, it may have been added to the Acharang. Since Acharprakalp has the provision of atonement, it was highly essential that it be considered as authoritative as the words of the Tirthankara. From this perspective, it may have been established as a Chula of Acharang. Based on Acharangniyukti, it is clear that the first four Chulas of Acharang were created based on Acharang, but the fifth Chula, Nishita, was created from the "Purva" called Pratyakhyan. Nishita also has a name called Achar.

In Acharangniyukti, it is clearly written about the Chulika of Acharang, "The subject of the Chulika was taken from Achar by the Sthaviras for the benefit of the disciples."

In Acharangniyukti Gatha 287, the word "Therhi" is used. While explaining the word Sthavir, Acharya Sheelank has written, "Who established Acharang and who were they? Were they Sthaviras or Chaturdashapurvadhar?" But in Acharangchurni, the word Sthavir is interpreted as Gandhar. In Nishitchurni, it is clearly mentioned that the author of Nishitasutra is the Tirthankara from the perspective of meaning and Gandhar from the perspective of Sutra. According to Nishitchurni, the author of Nishita is also considered to be Gandhar. The main reason for this is that Nishita is included under Angasahitya. Here, there is a difference of opinion regarding the meaning of the word Sthavir. Acharya Sheelank has interpreted the word Sthavir as Chaturdashapurvi but not as Gandhar. While in Acharangchurni and Nishitchurni, the meaning of Sthavir is interpreted as Gandhar. The main reason for this could be that Nishita is a part of Acharang. Acharang is Ang-Agam. The Tirthankaras are the meaning-interpreters of the Angas and the Sutra-creators are the Gandharas. From this perspective, they may have considered Nishita to be created by Gandhar.

Here, this question may naturally arise that the Niyukti was created before the Churni. The Niyuktikar has written Nishita as Sthavir and the Churnikar has written it as Gandhar. The main reason for this could be that the creators of the Angas are Gandharas, therefore it may have been written as Gandhar.

## Nishitha

This Agam is named Nishitha. In the Pravaranganniyukti, it is found as "Avarparushpa" and "Nisiha". These two names appear in many other places. In the Nandi Sutra, Ghora Pakkhiyamut Granth, the word "Nisiha" is used for this Agam. In the Dhavala and Jayadhavala, "Nisihiy" and "Nisihiy" are used respectively. In the Anga Prajnapti Chulika, the word "Nisehiy" is used.

The Sanskrit form of the word "Nisiha" is "Nishitha". The Sanskrit meaning of "Nisihiy" and "Nisihiy" is "Nidhik". Weber 6, while contemplating the word "Nisiha", wrote that the meaning of the word "Nisiha" should be "Nishedha". To prove his point, he presented the words "Nisihiya" and "Naishadhiki" in the Samachari Prakaran used in Uttaradhyayana. And by defining those words, he tried to prove that the meaning of the word "Nisiha" is not "Nishiv" but "Nishedha". In Digambar texts, the word "Nisihiya" is used in place of "Nisiha". The same word is found in Gommatasar. The Sanskrit form of "Nisihiya" is "Nishidhika" in the commentary of Gommatasar. Acharya Jinsen used the word "Nishidyaka" for "Nishitha" in the Harivansh Purana. In the Tattvarthabhashya, the Sanskrit form of the word "Nisiha" is considered to be "Nishitha". The same meaning is intended by the Niyuktikar. Thus, according to the opinion of the Svetambar literature, the Sanskrit form of "Nisiha" is "Nishitha" and its meaning is "Aprakashya". From the perspective of Digambar literature, the Sanskrit form of "Nisihiya" is "Nishidhika" and its meaning is the science of atonement or the science that prohibits the fault of negligence.

If we contemplate the word "Nisiha" from a scriptural perspective, then both Sanskrit forms of the word "Nisiha" are possible, because both "th" and "gh" are given the order of "hakara" in the Prakrit language. If we contemplate the Sanskrit meaning of the word "Siihiya" as "Nishidhika" and "Nishithika", then the meaning "Nishiy" or "Nishithika" seems more appropriate than "Nishid" or "Nishidhika".

Nishitha and Nishidha, therefore, Nisihiya or...

The one who does not do, but the one who advocates atonement. Both the Svetambara and Digambara Acharyas agree on this statement.

Nishith is described as the proponent of the Pratisedha Sutra or the Pratikshetra Sutra in the Churni.2 In the Nishith Bhashya, it is written that the atonement that comes from violating the action prescribed in the Payarchala is described in the Nishith.3 The Nishith Sutra has exceptions. Therefore, it should not be read in assemblies etc. It should not be published to the unauthorized. Therefore, the meaning of Nishith is appropriate because it is to be read at night or in solitude. The prohibitive meaning of Nishith can also be reconciled in this way that it is forbidden to read to the unauthorized and also forbidden to read in a place crowded with people. It is only to be read in the place of self-study.

The word 'Nishedyak' is found in the Harivansh Purana. It is possible that this Sutra was taught in a special type of Nishedya. Therefore, it may have been named Nishedyak. When criticizing, the critic would arrange for the Nishedya for the Acharya.4 It is possible that the Nishedya was also arranged during the time of the present study. Therefore, it is mentioned in the Nishith Bhashya.

The synonyms of Nishith are Achar, Agra, Prakalpa, and Chalika. The Pratikshetra Sutra is related to the Charan Karananuyog. Therefore, its name is Achar. The Acharang Sutra has five Agra. There are four Pracharchalas and Nishith, these are the five Agra, therefore the name of Nishith is Agra. Nishith is created from the ninth Purva Prachar Prabhat, therefore its name is Prakalpa. The second meaning of Prakalpan is also the one who cuts. In the Agam literature, the name of Nishith is 'Ayar Pakapp'. Agra and Chula are words with the same meaning.

In short, the essence is that the meaning of Nishith is mysterious or confidential. Just as mysterious knowledge, mantras, tantras, yoga etc. are not told to the unauthorized or those with immature minds. They are kept secret from them.

"The Jina, the Lord Mahavira, being omniscient and all-seeing, knew well the weaknesses of the human mind. He wanted to protect his order of ascetics from these weaknesses, so he emphasized the strong code of conduct of the ascetic order. Sometimes in a known state and sometimes in an unknown state, a fault is incurred. The accepted vows are broken. To purify oneself after a vow is broken or a fault is committed, a code of atonement was created. The Chhedasutras prohibit those events that tarnish the life of a restrained person and some atonements are also based on immediate events. But when we study the Chhedasutras in depth, it seems that all the prohibitions are presented with ahimsa and aparigraha as the center. From a historical perspective, it is also easily known that such tendencies would have prevailed in the monastic orders of India at that time. To prevent the tendencies from being adopted by the ascetics and ascetics, they were prohibited and perhaps if they were adopted, their atonement was also ordained. Thus, prohibitions and atonement methods have been propounded from various perspectives.

The Nishītha has its own unique place in the Chhedasutras. The Vyavahārasūtra clearly states that the one who is well-versed in the scriptures must study the Āchāraprakalpa at least. The one who is knowledgeable about the Āchāraprakalpa can be given the position of Upādhyāya. The ascetic who has studied the Āchāraprakalpa from the mouth of the guru and has a firm resolve in his mind to study it from the point of view of meaning, can be given the position of Ācharya or Upādhyāya if the Ācharya and Upādhyāya die suddenly. If a young ascetic has forgotten the Āchāraprakalpa for some reason, he can be given the position of Ācharya etc. again after remembering it. But if an elder saint forgets the Āchāraprakalpa and does not have the ability to remember it, he can still be given the position of Ācharya. The ascetic who remembers the Āchāraprakalpa can be given the position of Pravartinī. If by mistake, the ascetic has forgotten the Āchāraprakalpa but is trying to remember it again, she can be given the position of Pravartinī.

The ascetics and ascetics who are elders. If they forget the Āchāraprakalpa due to special circumstances, they can ask questions about the Āchāraprakalpa in any state, whether they are asleep or sitting, and they can remember it again.

They can also do this, it is a special permission for them. From all these provisions, it is clear how important the Ācāra-prakalpa is. The Ācāra-prakalpa-dhara is multi-learned, he can move freely.
There are three types of Ācāra-prakalpa-dhara - (1) Some only hold the sūtra. (2) Some only hold the meaning. (3) Some hold both the sūtra and the meaning. The one who is only a sūtra-dhara is not entitled to give atonement. The right person to give atonement is the śramaṇa who holds both the sūtra and the meaning. If he does not hold the sūtra and the meaning, then atonement can also be taken from those who only hold the meaning. In the past, this question was very much discussed that when the Kevala-jñānī, Manaḥ-paryāya-jñānī and Avadhi-jñānī, Caturdaśa-pūrva, Daśa-pūrva, Nava-pūrva are not there, then who gives atonement? 2 In answer to this question, Ācārya Jinabhadragaṇi Kṣamāśramaṇa has written that today there is a lack of Kevala-jñānī etc. direct knowers. But the atonement method bound by the previous śruta by the direct knowers is revealed in the Ācāra-prakalpa. Therefore, the Ācāra-prakalpa-dhara Ācārya is entitled to give atonement.
From the present discussion, it is clear that the Niśītha has its own glorious place in Jain Āgama literature. The author of Niśītha
The creations of Jain Āgamas have been done in two ways - (1) Kṛta (2) Niyuhaṇa. Those Āgamas which have been created independently and independently are called Kṛta Āgamas. For example, the Dvādaśāṅgī was created by the Gaṇadharas and the Upāṅga literature was created by different sthaviras. They are all Kṛta Āgamas. Niyuhaṇa Āgamas are considered to be
(1) Daśavakālika (2) Ācāra-cūla (3) Niśītha (4) Daśaśruta-skandha (5) Bṛhat-kalpa (6) Vyavahāra. In these six Āgamas, the Daśavakālika Āgama was niyuhaṇa by the Caturdaśa-pūrva-dhara Śayyambhavasūri and the remaining five Āgamas were niyuhaṇa by Bhadra-bāhu Svāmī. According to the Ācārāṅga-niyukti, the Ācāra-cūla is created by the sthaviras. 5 In the Ācārāṅga-vṛtti, Ācārya Śīlāṅka has defined the meaning of sthavira as Caturdaśa-pūrva.

The ninth *purva* called *pratyakhyana* has been *nishith* *niryahana*. There are twenty items in that *purva*, meaning twenty *arthaadhikars*. The name of the third item is *ayara*. *Ayara* also has twenty *praabhutcchheda*, meaning subdivisions. The *nishith* *niryahana* has been done from the twentieth *praabhutcchheda*.

According to the opinion of *Dasaashrutaskandha* *chuni*, *Dasaashrutaskandha*, *kalpa* and *vyavahar* these three *agamas* are *nishoodha* from the *purva* called *pratyakhyana* and the *nirduhaka* of those three *agamas* is *Chaturdashapurvi* *Bhadrabahu* *Swami*. This is clearly mentioned. In *Panchakalapa* *mahaabhashya* also, *Bhadrabahu* is mentioned as the *niryahana* of *dasa*, *kalpa* and *vyavahar* and in *Panchakalapa* *churni*, *Pracharaprakalpa* (*nishith*) is considered as the *niryahana* of these four *agamas* - *dasa*, *kalpa*, *vyavahar* and *pracharaprakalpa*. Here, this question is worth pondering that the name of *acharaprakalpa* is not mentioned in *niyukti* and *bhashya*. But how did the name of *acharaprakalpa* come in *Panchakalapa* *churni*? It is also possible that the word 'kalpa' may be understood by the *niyuktikara* and *bhashyakara* as both *brahatkalpa* and *acharaprakalpa*. Just like in *nishith* *bhashya*, they have taken *dasaashrutaskandha*, *brahatkalpa* and *vyavahar* these three *agamas* from the word 'k appa'. It is possible that the creator of *acharchula* and *chedasutra* is *Chaturdashapurvi* *Bhadrabahu*.

Previous *acharyas* have mentioned three types of *agamas* - *suttaagama*, *atthaagama* and *tadubhayaagama*. From another perspective, there are three more types of *agamas* - *aatmaagama*, *anantaaraagama* and *paramparaagama*. The discussion of this is found in the commentary texts. For the *tirthankara*, the meaning is *aatmaagama*. The same meaning is *anantaaraagama* for the *ganadharas*. For the *ganadharas*, the *sutra* is *aatmaagama* and for the *ganadharashiṣyas*, the *sutra* is *anantaaraagama* and the meaning is *paramparaagama*. For the *ganadharashiṣya* and after that for the *shiṣya* *parampara*, both the meaning and the *sutra* are *paramparaagama*. In these, the original source of the *agama*, the first attainment and the traditional attainment have been considered from these three perspectives. From the perspective of *acharya* *Jinadasagani* *mahattar*, the *tirthankara* is the *nishith* of the meaning *prarupa*. The first attainment of his meaning happened to the *ganadharas* and the traditional attainment of that meaning happened to his *shiṣya* and *prashishyas* and is happening in the present.

From the perspective of the Sutra Agama, the author of the Nisitha Sutra is Ganadhara. The first attainment of that Sutra was by the disciples of Ganadhara, and the traditional attainment was by the students of Ganadhara.

Thus, according to Acharya Jinadasagani Mahttar, the author of the Nisitha is the Tirthankara from the perspective of meaning, and Ganadhara from the perspective of the Sutra. Then, the question naturally arises as to how Bhadrabahu was considered the author of the Nisitha by the Panchakल्पणिकार. When we ponder deeply on this question, we find its solution in the Dashaśrutaskandhaniyukti. There, the Niyuktikar, while contemplating the Dashaśrutaskandha, has written that the present ten categories are smaller than the ten categories obtained in the Angapravesht Agamas. The elders (sthaviras) made these smaller categories for the benefit of the disciples. According to the Panchakल्पभाष्य चणि, those elders were Bhadrabahu. In short, we can say that the Tirthankara is the formulator of the meaning, Ganadhara is the author of the Sutra, and Bhadrabahu Swami is the creator of the present concise form.

At the end of the Nisitha Sutra, three verses are found in the praise (prasasti). Based on these, there is a belief among scholars that the author of the Nisitha is Vishakhacharaya. In all the available pattavalis of the Shvetambar tradition, there is no mention of Vishakhacharaya. In the pattavali of the Digambar tradition, the name of Vishakhacharaya is found after Bhadrabahu. Vishakhacharaya was a knower of the ten previous births. Bhadrabahu Swami lived for one hundred and sixty-two years after the nirvana of the Veer. Only after him did the era of Vishakhacharaya begin. In the praise verses, for Vishakhacharaya, "Tass Lihiyam Nisīham" - here, the meaning of "लिखित" can be both "author" and "writer". There is no mention of any other Vishakhacharaya in the pattavalis. When the name of Vishakhacharaya was clearly mentioned as the author of the Nisitha in the praise, why did the Chanikara write the Nisitha as being authored by Ganadhara, and why did Acharya Sheelank write the author of the Nisitha as being a knower of fourteen previous births? It is not possible to say anything definitively in response to this.

Another question arises: were these praise verses present before the Niyuktikar, the Bhashyakar, and the Churnikar? If it is assumed that the author of the Nisitha was Vishakhacharaya, then the second question is: did Vishakhacharaya compose the praise verses? From the study of the verses, it is clear that Vishakhacharaya himself could not introduce himself in this way; how could he praise his own qualities? If Vishakhacharaya had given these verses at the end of the main text, what objection could the Niyuktikar have had in mentioning Vishakhacharaya? Why would he then refer to him with the word "sthavir"? Therefore, it is clear that these three praise verses were not present before the Niyuktikar.

There were no verses. If these verses were by Vishakhacharaya, then Churnikar would have definitely written a commentary on these verses and there would have been a hint of it in the Sanskrit commentary of the twentieth Uddeshak. Therefore, it seems clear that these verses were not written by Vishakhacharaya. If it is imagined that these verses were written by Vishakhacharaya, then the meaning of the word 'lihiyam' here is not composition but book writing. If it is assumed that Bhadrabahu composed Nishita and Vishakhacharaya wrote it down, it also does not seem possible. If Vishakhacharaya of the Digambara tradition had written down Nishita, then Nishita would have been accepted in the Digambara tradition, but the acceptance of Nishita in the Svetambara tradition is not in the Digambara tradition. Therefore, it seems that the scribe of Nishita, Vishakhacharaya, must have been an Acharya of the Svetambara tradition, not the Digambara tradition. It is investigable who they were? Where were they from? What were their lines of introduction?' Who created these three verses of the eulogy and who wrote them at the end of Nishita. There is no correct evidence. In such a situation, it is not appropriate to decide the act of Nishita on the basis of these verses. These verses are not created by Vishakhacharaya because of the inscription of Vishakhacharaya's qualities. Some disciple-disciple of Vishakhacharaya may have inscribed it at the end of the book.
We have been able to indicate in the previous lines that according to Panchakalapa Churni, the one who composed Nishita is Bhadrabahu Swami. This opinion has also been supported by Punyavijayaji, the influencer of Agam. It has become clear after this investigation that Acharachula Chaturdashapurvi was composed by Bhadrabahu. The style of composition of Acharachula is completely different from Acharang. It was composed after Acharang.
A question arose in the mind of a disciple that there is no Tirthankara Prabhu at present, nor is there a Shrutakevali, nor a Dashapurvi or a Navapurvi. In such a situation, if a fault is committed, how will it be purified? In the absence of a special knower, who will purify the practice by giving atonement. The Acharya saw the disciple's worried face. He listened to his words. The Acharya said in very sweet words - 'Vats! Your thinking is appropriate. Today Tirthankara and Chaturdashapurvi are not in front of us, but the Acharyas who are holding the study of Acharaprakalpa composed by Chaturdashapurvadhar are present. They can purify by giving atonement.'
Jindasagani Mahttar has given two meanings of the word 'Chaudaspuvvani-badho' - 'composed by Chaturdashapurvi or composed by Chaturdashapurva'. We have written in the previous lines that Nishita was composed by the ninth Purva. Therefore, no special meaning is revealed from Chaturdashapurvi's composition. Therefore, Jindasagani Mahttar has considered Chaturdashapurvi Bhadrabahu as the author of Nishita. This seems consistent.
Mahamahishi Pandit Dalsukh Bhai Malvaniya has thought about it from various perspectives in detail in his introduction. But he himself could not reach the conclusion of who the author of Nishita is. His opinion was definitely that Nishita should not be composed by Bhadrabahu or Vishakhacharaya. The composition of Nishita should be before the Svetambara and Digambara differences of opinion. After Bhadrabahu, there has been a difference in both the Svetambara and Digambara traditions. Nishita's

Both traditions mention it, so it must have been created before the schism. The *Vyavaharsutra*, which is considered to be the work of Acharya Bhadrabahu, mentions *Acharaprakalpa* many times. This clearly shows that Bhadrabahu was aware of *Nishith*. Even if the current form of *Nishith* is not the same, it is logical to assume that *fate* was composed before Bhadrabahu's time. *Nishith* was created within 150 years of the Nirvana of Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira. According to *Panchakalapachurni*, Acharya Bhadrabahu composed *Nishith*, and his time is the same. If we follow the other tradition, then Vishakacharya came after Bhadrabahu. Even then, it can be said without a doubt that *Nishith* was created within 175 years of the Nirvana of Vira.

Pandit Muni Shri Kalyanvijayji Gani's clear opinion is that Bhadrabahu Swami is the one who established the *Brihatkalpa* and *Vyavahar* from the *Purvasruta*, and that the one who established *Nishithadhyayan* is not Bhadrabahu but Aryarakshitasuri. Bhadrabahu Swami's provision of atonement in *Kalpa* and *Vyavahar* was sufficient for the Shraman-Shramanis of that time, but by the time of Aryarakshitasuri, the situation had changed drastically. The situation of famine etc. during the Maurya period had ended. The number of Shraman-Shramanis had increased significantly during the time of King Samprati Maurya. With the increase in the number of Shramans, many new problems had also arisen. Therefore, the atonement provision of *Kalpa* and *Vyavahar* seemed insufficient. To control these new situations, it was necessary to create a detailed atonement provision. Therefore, Aryarakshita did not do it from the previous literature. There were six *uddeshakas* in *Kalpadhyayan*, ten *uddeshakas* in *Vyavahar*, twenty *uddeshakas* in *Nishithadhyayan*, and atonement provisions in about 1426 sutras.

The *Panchakalapabhashya Churnikar* has stated that *Nishithadhyayan* was also quoted from *Shruthadhar Bhadrabahu Swami* along with *Kalpa*, *Vyavahar*, etc., but this is not the truth. There is a clear difference in the language and the topics discussed in the *Brihatkalpa* and the sutras of *Nishithadhyayan* and the topics discussed in them. It is true that there is a difference in the language of *Brihatkalpa* and *Vyavahar*, but this difference is due to the changes made later in *Vyavahar*. This is why *Nishithadhyayan* is called *Prakalpaadhyayan* in *Vyavaharsutra*. This change may have happened after Aryarakshitasuri.

**Basis and Subject Matter of Nishith**

*Nishith* is the fifth *chula* of *Shracharang*. It is also called *Nishithadhyayan*. It has twenty *uddeshakas*. The twentieth *uddeshaka* describes the process of giving atonement.

The first *uddeshaka* mentions the monthly *anudghatik* (guru masa) atonement. The second to fifth *uddeshakas* mention the monthly *udghatik* (laghu masa) atonement. The sixth to eleventh *uddeshakas* mention the *chaturmasik* *anudghatik* (guru chaturmas) atonement. The twelfth to twentieth *uddeshakas* mention the *chaturmasik* *udghatik* (laghu chaturmas) atonement.

This text discusses the concept of *prāyaścitta* (penance) in Jainism, specifically focusing on the types of *prāyaścitta* and their duration. 

It mentions that there are five types of *prāyaścitta* based on their duration: 

* **Māsika Udghatika:** Monthly with initiation
* **Māsika Anudghātika:** Monthly without initiation
* **Caturmāsika Udghatika:** Four-month with initiation
* **Caturmāsika Anudghātika:** Four-month without initiation
* **Āropaṇā:**  A type of penance that involves applying the penance for one offense to another.

The text then delves into the concept of *Āropaṇā*, explaining that it is a way to combine different types of penance. It outlines five types of *Āropaṇā*:

1. **Prasthāpita:**  Starting a specific penance from among many obtained through *prāyaścitta*.
2. **Sthāpita:** Maintaining the penance obtained through *prāyaścitta* without interruption due to any reason like *vaiyāvṛtya* (hindrance).
3. **Kṛtsnā:**  A type of *Āropaṇā* where the penance is completed within its designated duration, especially when the maximum duration of penance is six months.
4. **Akṛtsnā:**  A type of *Āropaṇā* where the penance is not completed within its designated duration, especially when the penance exceeds six months.
5. **Hāḍahada:**  A type of *Āropaṇā* where the penance is completed quickly.

The text further clarifies that while there are two main types of *prāyaścitta* (monthly and four-monthly), other durations like bi-monthly, tri-monthly, five-monthly, and six-monthly are created through *Āropaṇā*. It also mentions that the 20th *uddeśaka* (chapter) of the *Nīśītha* text focuses on *Āropaṇā*.

Finally, the text highlights that while the *Sthānāṅgasūtra* mentions five types of *Āropaṇā*, the *Samvāyāṅga* text lists 28 types, ranging from one month to four months in duration.

(23) One hundred and forty days (24) One hundred and forty-five days (25) Udvatiki Aroopana (26) Anudghatiki Shraaropana (27) Kritsna Shraaropana (28) Prakritna Aroopana.

In the reign of a Tirthankara, the Tirthankara himself performs the highest penance, and no other person in his reign can perform more penance than that. The first Tirthankara, Bhagwan Rishabhdev, performed penance for one year. In his reign, there was no provision for penance for more than one year. From Bhagwan Ajitnath to Bhagwan Parshvanath's reign, a seeker could perform penance for eight months. Bhagwan Mahavira performed the highest penance for six months, so in his reign, the provision for penance is six months, no more. Therefore, in Bhagwan Mahavira's reign, the provision for Aroopana-obtained atonement is also not more than six months. The atonement of Chhed is also the highest for six months. It can be given a maximum of three times. After that, the original atonement is given.

The style of composition of Nishita is different from the Dasha Shruta Skandha, Vyavahar, Brihatkalpa, etc. Chhed Sutras. Up to nineteen Uddeshak, each Sutra is complete with Saizjad and the Uddeshak is complete with the provision of atonement, but the style of composition of the twentieth Uddeshak is completely different from the nineteen Uddeshak. Many facts are given in the twentieth Uddeshak. But the style of the Sutra is very concise. Therefore, it is very difficult to understand the Guru's profound secret that remains in the Sutra without Gurugama or without explanatory literature. This is the reason why commentaries, Churnis, etc. have been created on the present Sutra in great detail. There is a detailed discussion of Utsarg and Apavad Marg in Niyukti, Bhashya, Churni, Subodh Vyakhya, etc.

Two paths of Sadhana: Utsarg and Apavad

:

Sadhana has a glorious place in Jain culture. The pages of ancient Jain literature are illuminated by the bright light of Sadhana. Sadhana is called the lifeblood of life. Only through proper Sadhana does a seeker attain his goal. The every particle of a seeker's life is filled with the sweet stream of renunciation, penance, self-study, and meditation.

Utsarg and Apavad Marg

There are two banks of the Jain Sadhana river - one is 'Utsarg' and the other is 'Apavad'. The word Utsarg means 'main' and the word Apavad means 'secondary'. Utsarg Marg means the provision of major rules for the protection, purification, and growth of inner life, character, and virtues, and Apavad means the protection of inner life, etc.

The purpose of the rules for restrictions (utsarga) and exceptions (apavada) is to purify and enhance the path of spiritual practice. Both utsarga and apavada have the same goal: to guide the practitioner towards the path of worship. A common practitioner might wonder why there are two forms when both utsarga and apavada have the same goal.

In response, it is important to understand that the wise Jain sages, deeply knowledgeable about Jain culture, have established the paths of utsarga and apavada, taking into account the physical and mental weaknesses of humans and the overall progress of the community. The commentator of the Nisitha Bhashya writes, "For a capable practitioner, the substances prohibited in the utsarga state may become acceptable due to special circumstances." Utsarga and apavada are not contradictory.

Acharya Jinasagargani Mahत्तर२ writes, "Things prohibited in the utsarga path become conceivable and acceptable when a reason arises." This is because both utsarga and apavada have the same goal and are complementary to each other. The practitioner can progress on the path of spiritual practice only by harmonizing both. If utsarga and apavada were contradictory, they would not be utsarga and apavada, but rather promoters of free will. Both are referred to as paths in the Agamic literature. One path is straight like a highway, while the other is slightly winding.

**General Method: Utsarga**

Walking on the utsarga path is the normal practice of a practitioner's life. A person walks on a highway, but if there is an obstacle on the highway, they leave the highway and take a nearby path. When it becomes convenient after walking a short distance, they return to the highway. This is the situation with a practitioner taking the apavada path from the utsarga path, and the same method applies to returning from apavada to utsarga.

The utsarga path is the general method. The practitioner continuously walks on this path. The utsarga path should not be abandoned without a special circumstance. A practitioner who abandons the utsarga path and adopts the apavada path without reason is not a paraadhak (one who transgresses the rules), but a viraadhak (one who opposes the rules). A perfectly healthy person who takes medicine or pretends to be sick and takes medicine even after the illness has gone is failing in their duty. Apavada should not be used in the absence of a special reason. When the reason for using apavada is gone, the practitioner should return to the utsarga path.

**Specific Method: Apavada**

We have already explained that apavada is a specific path. Like utsarga, it is a path of restraint and spiritual practice. However, apavada must be a real exception. If the intention behind apavada is to indulge the senses, it is not the apavada path. Therefore, the practitioner needs to be constantly aware on the apavada path. Apavada should be used only as much as absolutely necessary, not continuously. The apavada path is for a special situation.

The path of exception is like the sharp edge of a gleaming sword. Not every seeker can walk on it. The seeker who has deeply studied the Acharaanga and other Agam literature, understood the profound secrets of the Cheda Sutras, and has clear knowledge of the Utsarga and Apavada paths, only such a great seeker can adopt the exception. If a seeker who does not have knowledge of the country, time, and situation, adopts the path of exception, then he may deviate from his practice. A skilled merchant understands income and expenditure properly and conducts business, he makes maximum profit with minimal expenditure. Similarly, a seeker, in a particular situation, increases his virtues by consuming the fault.
Acharya Bhadrabahu has written about the virtues of the seeker - he has knowledge of income-expenditure, cause-non-cause, deep (glance)-non-deep, object-non-object, appropriate-inappropriate, capable-incapable, effort-non-effort, and he also knows the result of duty and work.
The seeker has the responsibility to consume the exception himself or allow others to consume the exception. A non-seeker cannot decide on his own to consume the exception. The seeker has knowledge of substance, field, time, and emotion, which allows him to progress on the path of practice.
Pracharaya Sanghadasagani has explained the Utsarga and Apavada paths through a beautiful metaphor. A traveler is moving towards his destination at a fast pace. Sometimes he takes fast steps, sometimes he runs to reach quickly. But when he is very tired and sees a difficult path ahead, he sits for a few moments to rest, because without rest, it is difficult for him to take even a single step. But the traveler's rest is for moving forward. His rest is not for rest, but for progress.
The seeker also walks on the path of Utsarga. But due to some reason, he has to take recourse to the path of exception. That exception is only for the protection of Utsarga, not for its destruction. Imagine - there is a terrible poisonous boil in the body. To protect the body, the boil is surgically removed. The cutting and piercing of the body is not for the destruction of the body, but for the protection of the body.
If the seeker is fully capable and can willingly embrace death in a specific situation, then he should embrace it with equanimity. If equanimity is disturbed in embracing death, then he should strive to protect his vows to save his life.
In the commentary of Proghaniryakti, Acharya Drona has written that the results of the seeker who consumes the exception are completely pure, and completely pure results are the cause of liberation, not of the world. The seeker's body is for vows.

"If the body is not there, how can it practice restraint? The body is essential for the practice of restraint." The goal of the seeker is neither to live nor to die. He does not desire to live nor does he desire to die. He wants to live so that knowledge, vision, and character can grow. He prefers to do the work that leads to the attainment and growth of knowledge, vision, and character, and brings purity to the practice of restraint. When he sees that the body is becoming an obstacle to the growth of knowledge, vision, and character, he accepts death with affection.

A disciple asked with curiosity, "O Lord! Tell me, is *utsarga* the *svasthāna* for the seeker or is it an exception?"

It was said that for a seeker whose body is perfectly healthy and strong, the path of *utsarga* is the *svasthāna* and the exception is the *parastthāna*. But for one whose body is diseased and weak, the exception is the *svasthāna* and *utsarga* is the *parastthāna*.

Where there is zeal for restraint in the seeker, there is also awareness of discretion. The description of the path of exception has been made only from the perspective of the *sthavirakalpa*. The *jinkalpi* *śramaṇa* walk only on the path of *utsarga*. Exception is a secret.

In the *Nishithachurni*, the word "prohibition" is used for *utsarga* and "permission" for exception. *Utsarga* is prohibition and exception is a rule. All the forbidden actions that have been told for the restrained *śramaṇa* come under prohibition, and when permission is given to perform those forbidden actions in special circumstances, then those forbidden actions become rules. Due to special circumstances, even an improper action sometimes becomes proper. An ordinary seeker does not have the power to transform prohibition into a rule. He cannot even test the propriety or impropriety. That is why exception, permission, or rule is not told to every seeker. For this reason, the synonym of exception in the *Nishithachurni* is also a secret.

Just as following prohibition (*utsarga*) keeps conduct pure, so too should the acceptance of the path of exception be considered pure conduct. Why and for what purpose is there an exception?

Many conditions have been laid down before accepting the path of exception. If those conditions are not taken into account, the path of exception will become a cause of downfall. For this reason, there are two types of *pratisevana*: the use of exception without reason is called "arrogant *pratisevana*."

There is "Kalpa" due to reason and cause. We have already stated that the seeker progresses towards the path of liberation by practicing and worshipping knowledge, vision, and character. The observance of character is for the growth of knowledge and vision. Character is not that which leads to the loss of knowledge and vision through its worship. Character is that which strengthens knowledge and vision. Due to knowledge and vision, one is compelled to take exceptions in character. All those exceptions are taken in Kalpa-pratisevna because they do not cause the seeker to deviate from his practice. Whatever exception is taken, knowledge and vision should be the two main goals. If there is no reason for either of them, then it is pratisevna-darp. It is the duty of the seeker to abandon the darp and accept the Kalpa. Because darp is considered forbidden for the seeker.
There may be a curiosity - in Nisith Bhashya and Channi etc., there is mention of exceptions being taken even in situations like famine etc. Then how is it said that exceptions should be taken only from knowledge and vision? The solution is - knowledge and vision are the two main reasons. In famine etc., there is no direct loss of knowledge and vision, but they have been taken due to the loss of knowledge and vision from tradition.
In famine, food cannot be obtained and without food, study etc. cannot be done. Therefore, it has been included in the reasons for exceptions.
In Nisith Bhashya, darp-pratisevna and kalpa-pratisevna are also described as pramad-pratisevna and apramad-pratisevna. Because pramad is darp and apramad is kalpa. The practice in which there is pramad is darp-pratisevna and the one in which there is apramad is kalpa-pratisevna. From the point of view of non-violence, utsarga and exception
The basic foundation of Jain ethics is based on non-violence. The other four great vows are extensions of non-violence. The act in which there is pramad is violence. In the life of a restrained seeker, there is a predominance of apramad. Two types of apramad-pratisevna have been made - anabhoga and sahasakar. Even after being apramad, if there is forgetfulness of the committee like iryaa etc., if it is not used for a short time due to some reason, then it is anabhoga. There is no violence in it, but there is forgetfulness. After the tendency has arisen, if it is known that there is a possibility of violence, then that pratisevna is sahasakar. For example, a restrained seeker is walking thoughtfully. The creature was not visible before, but as soon as he took a step, the creature came into view. Even after trying to save it, the foot fell on the creature and the creature died, then this is 'sahasa-pratisevna'. Due to being apramad, it is not karma-bandhan. The worship of non-violence is the path of utsarga for the Shraman. He does not commit any kind of violence against living beings with his mind, speech, and body. Acharang, Dashakalika and other Agam literature have a subtle analysis of the great vow of non-violence. A Shraman cannot touch any sentient object.

A श्रमण should not travel on high, low, uneven, rough paths, or where there are military camps, chariots, carts, or piles of grain. If it is absolutely necessary to travel on such a path due to unavoidable circumstances, they may take the support of a plant or a traveler's hand.

A श्रमण cannot touch green vegetation on an उत्सर्ग path. However, the exception of holding green vegetation, etc., is not for the purpose of harming the living beings in the plant kingdom, but for the sake of non-violence. If a श्रमण falls, they may suffer a broken limb or experience mental fluctuations. They may also harm other living beings by falling. Therefore, the exception in non-violence is mentioned keeping in mind both self and other forms of violence.

Similarly, a श्रमण cannot touch water with consciousness. However, they may go out for urination and defecation when the water is flowing rapidly and there is heavy rainfall. It is forbidden to forcibly restrain oneself from defecation and urination. This is because restraining oneself from defecation and urination can cause mental and physical distress, lead to diseases, and harm health, body, and self-control.

Just like the महाव्रत of non-violence, truth is also a life-vow for a श्रमण. The आचारांग also states that if a श्रमण is traveling and encounters a hunter, etc., and the hunter asks the श्रमण if they have seen any animals, etc., the श्रमण should remain silent in such a situation. If silence is not possible, they should say, "I don't know," even if they know. This is the exception path of truth.

In the वृत्ति of the सूत्रकृतांगसूत्र, Acharya शीलांक has clearly written that untruth spoken with a benevolent intention for self-control and secrecy is not a fault, but untruth spoken deceitfully to deceive others is a fault and therefore, despicable.

Like truth, in the practice of the महाव्रत of non-stealing, a श्रमण does not accept anything that is not given. However, if a situation arises where a श्रमण reaches a place where there are no facilities, and there is severe cold and rain, the श्रमण should first stay there without permission. They should then try to obtain permission afterwards.

Similarly, a श्रमण cannot touch a newborn girl to protect the महाव्रत of celibacy. However, the same श्रमण can save a drowning nun by catching her.

Similarly, in the great vow of non-possession, keeping extra tools in addition to the fourteen tools is also considered possession. But books, writing materials, etc. are accepted as means of knowledge. Therefore, they are not considered possession.
In the Dashavakalik, etc., there is a clear provision that a Shraman should not sit at the house of a householder, because sitting is considered improper, but the Dashavakalik also states that a Shraman who is very old, unhealthy, or who is an ascetic can sit at the house of a householder. He is not considered guilty of house-prohibition.
In the Agam literature, while discussing the food of a Shraman, it is clearly stated that he cannot take food prepared by others. He should follow the rules of Pindeshana properly. Acharya Sheelank has written in the Sutra Kritanga Vritti that in exceptional circumstances, if a Sadhak takes food prepared by others according to the scriptures, he is pure. He is not tainted by karma.
There are many instances in the Nisihtha Bhashya where it is stated that in situations like famine, etc., a Shraman can take food prepared by others, etc., through the path of exception.
It is a provision for a Jain Shraman that he should not desire medical treatment. If he falls ill, he should bear it with a calm mind. But when it was seen that a Shraman could not remain in samadhi when he was ill, there was also contemplation regarding his treatment. How should a Shraman go to the doctors, how should he take medicine, etc., how should he be treated in case of severe leprosy, etc., all these are discussed in detail in the Niyukti, Chuni, and Bhashya. It is also clarified that the opponents should not get an opportunity to criticize by taking advantage of those exceptions. If the opponents criticize and counter-criticize, it will be an insult to the Jain religion. Therefore, it has also been hinted that it should be kept secret.
Excess and Exception:
One thing to understand here is that there is a difference between excess and exception. Although excess and exception appear similar in external view, there is a lot of difference between excess and exception. In excess, there is an emergence of attachment, and due to the emergence of attachment or desire, and due to the feeling of passion, the act of going against restraint, leaving the path of discharge, is excess, and restraint is corrupted by excess.

Therefore, the seeker should know that if he has consumed a fault that was permissible, he should immediately perform atonement and purify himself from that fault. He who does not purify himself from that fault is a violator of the path of a monk.

In the case of an exception, there is consumption of a fault, but that consumption is due to compulsion. At the time of consumption, the seeker knows very well that if he does not consume the exception, his knowledge and other qualities will not be able to develop. With that view, he consumes the exception. In the consumption of the exception, the acquisition and preservation of virtues is paramount. There is no passion in the exception, but restraint is paramount. Therefore, that exception is not a pollution like transgression. In transgression, there is a predominance of passion, which leads to more karmic bondage.

Discretion is essential in both Utsarga and Apavada
Both the Utsarga path and the Apavada path are beneficial for the seeker as long as the light of 'discretion' shines in him. In the original Agam literature, the Utsarga path was given prominence, the Apavada path was mentioned but in a very small amount, but as the circumstances changed, the Acharyas elaborated on the exceptions in the commentary literature of the Agam literature. In the elaboration of exceptions, there has been some exaggeration, which is the effect of the situation of that era.

We have presented our thoughts on Utsarga and Apavada in a very brief manner. It is very difficult to understand the essence of Utsarga and Apavada. When the resultant effect and pure activity are destroyed in Utsarga and Apavada, it becomes misconduct. For this reason, the commentator has described the disciples as resultant, non-resultant and over-resultant. Only he who understands the situation correctly can worship the Utsarga and Apavada paths and inspire his followers to move towards the right goal. When the resultant feeling is destroyed, the tendency of selfishness starts to grow, freedom starts to increase, due to which the seeker cannot worship the path of non-attachment properly.

In the Brihatkalpa Bhashya, Acharya Sanghdasmani has written that there are as many rules of Utsarga as there are rules of Apavada. For the one who is entitled to the Utsarga path, Utsarga is Utsarga and Apavada is Apavada, but for the one who is entitled to the Apavada path, Apavada is Utsarga and Utsarga is Apavada. Thus, Utsarga and Apavada are beneficial, effective and powerful due to their own situation and circumstances.

This harmonious and subtle perspective of the Utsarga and Apavada paths is a special feature of Jainism's Anekanta. The Utsarga path is a symbol of the strength of life, while the Apavada path is a symbol of the weakness of life. The seeker should be very alert in both paths. The Acharyas have clearly said that the one who consumes the Apavada path is like a boil that has festered, the rope has been tied in it, then how does the person reduce the pain, keeping this in mind, he squeezes out the pus and in the same way, while consuming it with caution, he will have to keep in mind that there is no other way in restraint and vows, then the exception should be consumed, otherwise not. He is considered to be entitled to consume the exception, not the rest.

The Apavada path should be consumed. Less fault should be incurred. In special circumstances, for this purpose, the mention of the song is:

## Penance and Punishment

The Chhedasutra is a Sutra on Penance. Penance means purification of sin. The act of purifying sin is called penance. The offense is called 'praayah' and 'chitt' means purification. The process by which the offense is purified is penance. In the Prakrit language, the word "paayachchitt" is found for penance. 'Paay' means 'sin'. That which cuts sin is 'paayachchitt'. The seeker is in a state of 'chhadmasth', therefore, mistakes happen from him in known and unknown forms. Sins cling to his life. It is not as bad to make a mistake as it is to not recognize the mistake. Recognizing the mistake, making efforts for its purification, and making a firm resolve to not repeat the same fault in the future, and the process for the purification of the mistake, is penance.

There is a difference between penance and punishment. In penance, the seeker reveals his fault of his own accord and accepts it. If a fault has been committed inadvertently, then the seeker reveals that fault to the gurus and requests them to provide penance. The gurus tell the method to be free from that fault. On the contrary, a person accepts punishment not of his own accord but out of compulsion. He has no remorse for his wrongdoing. The offender accepts the crime not willingly but out of fear of others. Thus, punishment is imposed from above, but penance is accepted from within the heart. This is why there is a provision for punishment in politics and a provision for penance in religious ethics.

The one whose inner mind is simple, who is afraid of sin, whose heart has a strong desire for self-purification, in his mind the feeling of taking penance arises. If there is a kingdom of Maya in the mind, then purification cannot be achieved through penance. Mistakes are of many kinds. Many mistakes are common and many are extraordinary. Even common mistakes become uncommon due to country, time, and circumstances. Therefore, the penance for all types of mistakes is not the same. According to the mistakes and circumstances, different types of penance have been described.

In the texts like Stananga, Nishiya, Brihatkalpa, Vyavahar, Jitkalpa, etc., various types of penances are mentioned. While Samvayanga, etc., mention the types of penance, Nishith, etc., Agamas also describe in detail the offenses worthy of penance. Brihatkalpa Bhashya, Nishith Bhashya, Vyavahar Bhashya, Nishith Chuni, Jitkalpa Bhashya, etc., have a precise discussion of various principles and problems related to penance. The Digambar tradition's texts Mulachar, Jayadhwala, and the commentaries on Tattvarth Sutra, have expounded various types of penance. All types of penance are included in ten types of penance: (1) Palochana, (2) Pratikraman, (3) Ubhay, (4) Vivek, (5) Vyutsarg, (6) Tap, (7) Chhed, (8) Mul, (9) Anvasthapy, and (10) Paranchik. In Mulachar, the first eight names are the same, but instead of Anvasthapy, Parihar is used, and instead of Paranchik, Shraddhan is used. In Tattvarth Sutra, there is no mention of Paranchik penance, instead of Mul penance, Upasthapan is mentioned, and instead of Anvasthapy penance, Parihar penance is mentioned. Stananga and Jit

(b) Jitkalpa Sutra 4 (c) Dhwala 1315, 23163.1 

Page #46:
---------------------------
The text describes the ten types of atonement mentioned in the Kalpa, which are also described in the Digambar text Jayadhwala. The first form of atonement involves the practitioner experiencing remorse for their transgression. They acknowledge their wrongdoing and, with a pure heart, confess their transgression and violation of the rules to the Acharya or the Geetarth Shraman, seeking atonement to be freed from the fault. The text explains why and how to perform self-criticism and before whom it should be done, elaborating on it in the Stananga and other texts. I have written extensively about this in the book "Jain Achar Siddhant aur Swaroop," so those who are particularly curious should refer to it.

For specific transgressions, the text mentions the atonement of Tapas. The Nishita, Bahutkalpa, Jeetkalpa, and their commentaries explain the type of atonement to be undertaken for consuming specific types of food. The present Agam provides a detailed list of transgressions that warrant Tapas atonement and discusses various types of Tapas atonement, including Mas Laghoo, Mas Guru, Chaturmas Laghoo, Chaturmas Guru, Shatmas Laghoo, and Shatmas Guru atonement. The Bahutkalpa Bhashya discusses the atonement for the number of Tapas performed in months, days, etc., as follows:

Yathaguru - Six months of continuous fasting for five days each
Gurutar - Four months of continuous fasting for four days each
Guru - One month of continuous fasting for three days each (with oil)
Laghoo - 10 days of fasting for 10 days (one month of continuous fasting for two days each)
Laghootar - 25 days of continuous fasting for one day and eating for one day
Yathalaghoo - 20 days of continuous Ayambil (dry food)
Laghooshwak - 15 days of continuous Ekasan (one meal a day)
Laghoovaktar - 10 days of continuous two Porsi, meaning eating after 12 noon
Yathalaghooshwak - Five days of continuous Nirvikruti (food without ghee, milk, etc.)

**Brief Summary of the First Uddeshak**

The first Uddeshak contains 55 sutras and a detailed commentary spanning verses 497-815. It first prohibits manual labor for monks. It forbids the use of wood, fingers, or rods to manipulate the Angadan. It also prohibits massaging the Angadan with oil, ghee, butter, washing it with cold or hot water, removing the skin from the top and smelling it, etc. Reflecting on the reason for this prohibition, Acharya Sanghadasgani uses the example of a lion, a poisonous snake, a tiger, and a python to explain that just as a sleeping lion, when awakened, destroys the one who woke it, similarly, manipulating the Angadan, etc., can lead to the rise of intense attachment, causing the practitioner to deviate from their practice. The text also prohibits extracting Shukra Pudgal, using fragrant substances, placing stones, etc., to avoid mud on the path, placing ladders to climb high places, building drains to remove water, sharpening tools, cleaning scissors, nail clippers, ear cleaners, etc., requesting these things without purpose, requesting needles, etc., unlawfully, giving others from the things brought for oneself, removing thorns from needles, etc., brought for sewing clothes, getting utensils repaired by householders, getting embroidery done on clothes by householders, and getting more than three embroideries done on clothes.

---------------------------
It is forbidden to consume food that is mixed with impure food, even if it is mostly pure. This first principle emphasizes the need for constant vigilance on the part of the seeker. At every moment, the seeker should act in a way that is guided by wisdom. Even the smallest act done without wisdom can lead to karmic bondage. Therefore, even small objects like needles are forbidden to be kept without proper care. Dharma lies in wisdom. This is clear from these statements.

It is true that celibacy is ranked fourth in the enumeration of great vows. But due to its greatness and dignity, it is the first among all vows. In the *Prashnavyakarana Sutra*, while describing the greatness of celibacy, it is written that just as the Tirthankara is the best among the ascetics, so is celibacy among the vows. One who practices the vow of celibacy has practiced all the rules and regulations. Celibacy is the foundation of all vows. It is the crown jewel of vows. Therefore, it is very important for the seeker practicing celibacy to remain vigilant at all times and strictly follow this rule. This is the first instruction given at the beginning of the present *Agam*.

The second principle

The second principle has 57 sutras. In some copies, 59 sutras are also found. The commentary on it extends from 816 to 1437 verses. The first eight sutras discuss the *padaponshan*. A piece of old and torn blanket, one hand long and wide, is called *padaponshan*. The commentator, Pandit Muni Shri, has written extensively on this and in his commentary, he has clarified that *padaponshan* and *rajoharan* are two separate instruments. *Rajoharan* is used for cleaning, while *padaponshan* is only used for wiping the feet, etc. The meaning and utility of both are different. In addition to wiping the feet, *padaponshan* can be used for defecation if necessary. One can also sit on it if necessary, but *rajoharan*, etc., are not used in this way. If *padaponshan* is not available, the ascetic can take it from someone else. But *rajoharan* is only for oneself. Even *Jinkalpi* ascetics are considered to need *rajoharan*. *Rajoharan* is a technical instrument made from a group of pods, while *padaponshan* is a piece of cloth. It is sometimes tied to a wooden stick. It is an auxiliary instrument. The *padaponshan* with a wooden stick can be kept for as long as it is needed and in the area where it is needed. In the absence of need, the *padaponshan* with the wooden stick should be untied and kept. Only the *padaponshan* that is tied according to the method is considered to be well-made. It can be kept for a maximum of one and a half months. If it is necessary to keep it longer, it can be untied and changed.

After that, it is forbidden to use fragrant substances like perfumes. It is forbidden to make paths, etc. It is forbidden to make drains for water, sneeze covers, and *chilmili*, etc. The ascetic should not use harsh language. The use of harsh language creates distress in the mind of the listener. Language should be both truthful and beautiful. Language that causes distress to others is a form of violence. The use of even a little untruthful language is forbidden for the ascetic. It is also forbidden to accept unoffered things. It is forbidden to adorn and decorate the body, to wear precious and excellent things, etc. Monks are forbidden to keep leather. However, the commentator has mentioned the wearing of leather in exceptional circumstances. 

Page #48:
---------------------------
The path is full of thorns. In special circumstances, leather equipment can be used if there are snakes, severe cold, illness, or if one is suffering from a disease, is delicate, or has wounds on their feet. But not in the excretory passage.

The daily offering of food, donations, etc. is prohibited. Praising the donor before or after receiving alms. Going to the houses of householders before the time for alms. Going for alms with a non-Jain, with a householder, with a necessary and unnecessary person. Entering the study ground and the recitation-listening ground with them. Traveling from village to village with them. Using pleasing food and water, eating unpleasing food, eating leftover food without asking the ascetic who owns it. Accepting and using food from a Sagarika. Going for alms to a Sagarika's house without going inside. Violating the remaining time of the bed-stretcher period and the rainy season. Not keeping the bed-stretcher in the shade while getting wet in the rain. Taking it elsewhere a second time without permission. Traveling without returning the bed-stretcher to the one who gave it. Not searching for the bed-stretcher if it is lost. Not even copying a small portion of the text. Thus, the minor monthly atonement for various activities in the second chapter has been explained.

The prohibition of the things prohibited in this chapter is also mentioned in the Brihatkalpa, Pracharanga, Dashavalika, Pindaniyukti, etc. The description of the minor monthly atonement for all these atonement-worthy places has been done in the second chapter. This also sheds light on all these topics in a concise and meaningful way. The third chapter

The third chapter has 80 sutras. There are 1438-1554 verses of commentary on them. From the first to the twelfth sutra, it prohibits asking for food, etc. in a loud voice in a rest house, a traveler's inn, a resting place, or a householder's house, etc., going back to the householder's house again and again for food, etc. if he refuses, eating and drinking in a communal feast, cleaning, massaging, and washing the feet, and cleaning, massaging, and rubbing the body. It prohibits cutting overgrown hair and nails, covering the head while traveling, defecating in a cremation ground, in a mine, where coal, etc. is produced, in a fruit-gathering place, in a place where vegetables, etc. are kept, in a grove, and in a place where sunlight does not reach. It also describes the minor monthly atonement for the ascetic who performs these activities.

In addition to the present Pragama, it is found that many things are relevant for the Shramanas in the Aavashyakasutra, Acharangasutra, Dashavaikalikasutra, Prashnavyakarana, etc.

The fourth chapter

The fourth chapter has 128 sutras. There are 1555-1894 verses of commentary on these sutras. This chapter describes how to subdue the king, the king's protector, the city protector, the all-protector, the village protector, the state protector, the country protector, and the border protector, and how to praise their qualities to subdue them.

Giving and taking from one's own saint, the five types of श्रमणs: अवसन्न, कुशील, संसक्त, नित्यक. Taking food, etc., with hands contaminated by सचित्त substances like अपकाय, पृथ्वीकाय, etc. Performing bodily functions. Not transcribing the three उच्चार-प्रश्रवण भूमि at dusk. Disposing of excrement in a narrow place. Not purifying oneself after excreting. Contemplating on the प्रायश्चित्त for going for alms with someone who is undergoing प्रायश्चित्त, etc. These are the subjects on which प्रायश्चित्त has been contemplated and these actions are prohibited. For this, the monthly उद्घातिक परिहारस्थान, i.e., लघमासिका (मास-लघु) प्रायश्चित्त is prescribed. श्रमणs and श्रमणīs should be engrossed in their practice. If they forget their practice and try to subdue kings, etc., obstacles will arise in their practice. Kings, etc., are easily angered even when they are pleased. Therefore, they may also give उपसर्ग when they are displeased. Therefore, in this आगम, they are prohibited from pleasing and attracting them. The practitioner should practice in their own state of mind.

This उद्देशक indicates that the practitioner should act with discernment. The essence of श्रामण्य life is क्षमा. In anger, the ability to think and reason often becomes weak. Anger is a mental outburst. From that outburst, enmity is born, and from that, the intention to take revenge arises. कषाय is at the root of conflict. Therefore, engaging in conflict and rekindling old conflicts is prohibited. A matchstick burns itself before burning others. Whether it burns another or not, it burns itself. Similarly, the one who engages in conflict binds himself with karma. Conflict is a sin, therefore, the practitioner should avoid it.

श्रमणs are also prohibited from engaging in अट्टहास. The precious time of a श्रमण is to be spent in स्वाध्याय and meditation. Laughter, jokes, and अट्टहास often lead to conflict. The result of Draupadi's laughter was the Mahabharata war. Thus, the fourth उद्देशक states that श्रमणs should not engage in activities that obscure the path of practice. Excrement should not be disposed of in a place where there is a possibility of harming living beings. Also, there should be no possibility of public censure.

The fifth उद्देशक

The fifth उद्देशक has 52 सूत्रs. In some copies, 77 सूत्रs are also found. On these, there is a detailed commentary in 18952194 गाथाs. First, it is prohibited to sit near the root of a सचित्त tree, to sit, stand, sleep, eat, urinate, defecate, etc., and to engage in स्वाध्याय, etc. It is also prohibited to have one's cloth sewn by another तीथिक or householder, and to keep a cloth that is longer than the prescribed limit.

It is prohibited to wash neem leaves, etc., with अचित्त water or cold water. There is a provision for returning foot-wipers, staffs, sticks, needles, and returnable items within a specified period. It is prohibited to cut flax, cotton, etc., to make and keep attractive staffs of सचित्त colors and various colors, and to play the mouth, teeth, lips, nose, etc., like a veena. It is prohibited to use a bed that is not intended for the purpose, to make a menstrual cloth larger than the prescribed size, to make the menstrual cloth fine, to connect the menstrual cloths together, to tie them together illegally, to make even one unnecessary tie, and to make more than three ties even if necessary. It is prohibited to keep away menstrual cloths of other types besides the five types. Pressing with feet, etc., placing under the head, etc., all these activities attract लघुमासिक प्रायश्चित्त. Therefore, the practitioner should avoid all these activities.

A king should not accept *rajapinda* (royal food) even if it is offered by his ministers, priests, merchants, and caravan leaders. There is no such rule for other kings. If there is a possibility of fault, then it should not be accepted, but if it is innocent, then it can be accepted.

*Rajapinda* refers to royal food. Royal food is delicious, sweet, and intoxicating, which can increase the desire for taste. Such delicious food is not readily available everywhere. Therefore, to prevent a monk from becoming a gourmand and consuming unacceptable food, *rajapinda* is prohibited. The essence of this rule is the purity of desire. If someone forgets this rule and accepts or uses *rajapinda*, then the monk has to undergo a four-month penance.

There are other reasons behind the prohibition of *rajapinda*, which are mentioned in the *Nishithabhashya* and *Chuni*. In the royal palace, there is often a lot of movement of commanders and others. Sometimes, due to haste or other reasons, the monk may get injured or his bowl may break. These are also considered bad omens, so *rajapinda* is considered unacceptable.

The prohibition of *rajapinda* applies only to the monks of Lord Mahavira and Rishabhdeva, not to the monks of the twenty-two Tirthankaras. *Rajapinda* includes four types of food, clothing, bowls, blankets, and cleaning materials - these eight items are considered unacceptable. The ninth *uddeshaka* (chapter) has 25 sutras (aphorisms) on which a commentary has been written in 2496-2605 verses. This *uddeshaka* also prohibits the acceptance of *rajapinda*.

A monk should not enter the king's inner quarters. The commentator has mentioned three types of inner quarters: *jirna antahpur* (old inner quarters), *nava antahpur* (new inner quarters), and *kanya antahpur* (women's inner quarters). There were beautiful women in the inner quarters. The king tried to make the inner quarters as rich and beautiful as possible. Kautilya, in his *Arthashastra*, has laid down the rule that women and eunuchs should be deployed to protect the inner quarters. No one except relatives or servants was allowed to enter the inner quarters. The king guarded the inner quarters with utmost care. It was natural for the king to have suspicions if a monk entered the inner quarters, so monks were prohibited from entering the inner quarters.

A monk should not enter the inner quarters himself, but it is also forbidden to receive and accept food etc. from the woman who is appointed at the gate of the inner quarters. It is forbidden to accept food etc. from the king's gatekeepers, other attendants, soldiers, slaves, maids, for horses and elephants, for travelers in the forest, for people suffering from famine and drought, and for poor people.

For patients, those suffering from rain, and guests, it is forbidden to take food prepared in royal kitchens, and doing so incurs the penance of Guru Chaumasī. Danda-dhara, Danda-rakshaka, Dovārika, Varsha-dhara, Kancha-kipurusha, and Mahāttara, etc., were appointed for the protection of the inner apartments. It is also forbidden to take food for the king and queen. Do not take food from a king who has gone hunting, etc. Do not go for alms where the king has gone to eat. One should not even think of looking at the feet of the king's women adorned with all ornaments. One should not search for food, etc., before the royal assembly is dissolved. One should not study near the king's residence. In ancient times, Champa, Mathura, Vārāṇasī, Śrāvastī, Sāketa, Kampila, Kośāmbī, Mithilā, Hastināpura, and Rājagṛha were considered to be the ten capitals. Where there were always royal festivals. Therefore, Śramaṇas have been forbidden to go there repeatedly in the present Uddeshaka. If the prohibition is violated, there is a provision for the penance of Guru Chaturmasī. Due to fear of expansion, we are not introducing those capitals here. Where was their location in the past? Where is their location in the present? In the present Uddeshaka, besides Rājapinda, the penance for many incidents related to the king has also been described. The reason for this is that along with the violation of the order, many other harms can also occur. The tenth Uddeshaka.
The tenth Uddeshaka has 41 sūtras. In some copies, 47 sūtras are also found. On which there are 2606-3275 gāthās of commentary. Ācārya is the disciplinarian of the Śramaṇa Sangha. He is the center of infinite faith. In the absence of the Tīrthankara, the Ācārya conducts the Tīrtha. Therefore, it is the supreme duty of every sādhaka to have the utmost respect for him.
Only respectful words should be used towards the Ācārya. One who speaks angry words to the Ācārya, etc., speaks harsh words without affection, and commits Āsātana, incurs the penance of Guru Chaumasī. In Daśāśrutaskandha, 33 Āsātanas have been instructed. The commentary also mentions exceptions to Āsātanas. Which are based on dravya, kṣetra, kāla, and bhāva viveka. For example, if there are too many thorns on the way, and the disciple walks ahead of the Guru to remove those thorns, then it is not Āsātana.
In the present Uddeshaka, it is forbidden to take food together with Ananta-kāya. It is forbidden to take food with Ādhā-karmī. The title of Ādhā-karma is also forbidden. Śramaṇas should not tell about profit and loss. One should not seduce any Nirgrantha or Nirgranthī, nor should one abduct them. One should not seduce a dīkṣārthī, a gahaṣṭha, or a gahaṣṭhinī. After knowing the reason for the arrival of a Śramaṇa coming from outside, give him shelter. Because he may have come from somewhere after fighting, etc., do not eat with someone who does not pacify the quarrel or does not do penance. Eating with them and doing the opposite of penance, eating in the doubtful situation of sunrise or sunset, swallowing the udgāla that has come into the mouth at night, not serving the glāna according to the rules, wandering in the Varsha-vāsa, not doing Paryuṣaṇa on a fixed day, doing Paryuṣaṇa on an uncertain day, not doing Chauvihāra fast on the day of Paryuṣaṇa, not doing Loca, taking clothes in Varsha-vāsa, there is a description of Chaturmasik penance. In Daśāśrutaskandha, Uttarādhyayana, Daśavakālika, and other Prāgamas, it is also forbidden to commit Āsātana. 1. Daśāśrutaskandha Daśa 1 and 3 2. Uttarādhyayana A. 1 and 7 3.

The second Shruta Skandha of the Acharanga states that if food containing an infinite body is found, it should be replaced.
The Agam literature, including the Acharanga Sutra and the Sutra Kritanga, states in many places that a Shraman should not consume food that is contaminated with Adhakarma dosha. The statement of the cause is also justified because there is a possibility of it being false. These are two main characteristics of Mahavira's teachings. He emphasized the avoidance of nighttime meals and also placed great emphasis on the practice of celibacy.
In the Vedic tradition, wives lived with their husbands in the Vanaprastha Ashram, but Mahavira completely prohibited it. The root of this lies in the noble practice of non-violence. Modern scientists have also mentioned the harms caused by nighttime meals. We have elaborated on the Jain code of conduct and its analysis in detail in the book "Jain Achar Siddhant Swaroop aur Vishleshan". The Brihatkalpa prohibits wandering and wearing clothes during the rainy season. Special emphasis is placed on serving sick Shramans, and there is a provision for atonement if it is not done. Special provisions and atonement have been presented in the context of the Paryushana Mahaparva. The four-month atonement is mentioned for all of these.
Eleventh Uddeshak
The eleventh Uddeshak has 91 sutras with a commentary of 3276-3975 gathas. This Uddeshak prohibits keeping vessels made of iron, copper, glass, horn, leather, cloth, etc., and eating from them. It prohibits criticizing religion and praising irreligion. It prohibits performing bodily functions of a householder, scaring oneself or others, forgetting oneself or others, showing oneself or others in a different way. It prohibits praising the principles of the Dharma leader of the person in front of them, including their conduct, etc. It prohibits going back and forth between two opposing kingdoms, criticizing daytime meals, praising nighttime meals. It prohibits consuming alcohol, meat, etc. It prohibits praising the free-willed. It prohibits giving initiation to ineligible individuals. It prohibits serving ineligible individuals. It prohibits an Achel or Sachal Sadhu from staying with Achel or Sachal Sadhvis. It prohibits keeping powder, incense, etc., at night, praising those who commit suicide, etc. Those who consume these vices are subject to Guru Chaumasi atonement. The topics discussed in this Uddeshak are also mentioned in other Agams. The learned Muni has pointed out these places in his commentary. We are not writing about all these topics due to fear of expansion. Twelfth Uddeshak
The twelfth Uddeshak has 44 sutras and a commentary of 3976-4225 gathas, elaborating on each sutra. The first sutra states that a Shraman should not tie or untie living beings with a rope out of compassion. This natural curiosity may arise: compassion is a characteristic of Samyaktva, then why is it prohibited? The main reason is that he has to practice restraint with detachment. If he practices restraint

He who forgets and does such activities will face obstacles in his practice. Here, there is no atonement for compassion or mercy, but atonement for serving householders and for activities against restraint.
A Shraman who repeatedly breaks the vow of non-acceptance and approves of those who do so, incurs the minor Chaturmasik atonement. The commentary states that breaking the vow of non-acceptance leads to many faults. It is forbidden to wear skin with hair. It is forbidden to sit on a straw mat covered with a householder's cloth. It is forbidden to have a Sadhvi's cloth sewn by a non-Jain or a householder. It is forbidden to even slightly harm the beings of the five stationary categories, such as earth-bodied beings.

The prohibitions mentioned in this Uddeshak are found in the Agamas such as Dasha-Shruta-Skandha, Acharanga, Brihatkalpa, Dasha-Vaikalika, Sutra-Kritanga, etc. A Sadhak should not engage in such activities that would tarnish his practice. Thirteenth Uddeshak

Some of the prohibitions discussed in the thirteenth Uddeshak are also prohibited in the Acharanga, Sutra-Kritanga, Dasha-Vaikalika, Uttaradhyayayana, etc. There is an extensive discussion on the faults of production, etc., in Pindan-Niyukti. In short, a Sadhak should be aware every moment. He should not engage in any faulty activity. Fourteenth Uddeshak
The fourteenth Uddeshak has 41 Sutras. Some copies also have 45 Sutras. There is an extensive commentary on them, consisting of 4473-4689 Gathas.

After that, it is forbidden to get work done from the householder, to defecate and urinate in unimaginable places, and to give and take food, clothes, etc. from the neighboring Shraddha, etc. It is forbidden to take care of the body from the point of view of adornment, to polish and wash clothes, etc. Doing these activities is said to be a small Chaumasik atonement.

The things discussed in the present Uddeshak are also discussed in the second Shrutaskandha of Acharang. There too, it is forbidden to eat mangoes and other fruits with awareness. It is forbidden to get the body taken care of by the householder and it is also forbidden to defecate and urinate in unimaginable places. In Uttaradhyayayana and Dasavekalik, it is forbidden to act from the point of view of adornment. Adornment is compared to poison.

The things discussed in the sixteenth Uddeshak and the actions that are forbidden are also discussed in the Pacharang Dvitiya Shruta Skandha, Brihatkalpa and Dasha Shruta Skandha. In the Agam literature, the Sadhak is warned again and again not to indulge in such tendencies that distort the life of a Sanayami. Seventeenth Uddeshak
The seventeenth Uddeshak has 155 Sutras. In some copies, 151 Sutras are found. There are 59045996 Gathas of commentary on them.

From the first to the thirty-second Sutra, various aspects of boat travel have been considered. Although a Shraman is completely renounced of the Viradhana of Apakaya beings, how can he travel by boat? But in Acharang Sutra, Brihatkalpa and Dasha Shruta Skandha, there is also a provision for boat travel as an exception. But it must be remembered that it is only for the permitted waterway.

It is forbidden to study the scriptures during the time of midday, afternoon, and midnight, as well as on the four great festivals and the four pratipada days that follow them. The Kalikasutra describes the four praharas for studying the scriptures. Studying the scriptures during the thirty-two types of asvadhyaya times. Studying the scriptures during the time of physical asvadhyaya. Not reciting the sutras in the order of pragmokt, starting the recitation of nishith etc. chedasutras without completing the recitation of Acharang etc., giving recitation to the ineligible and not giving recitation to the eligible, showing partiality in giving recitation to equally worthy individuals, taking recitation oneself without taking recitation from the acharya, upadhyaya, giving recitation to other mithyatvis, other tethis, pavasthadi etc. is prohibited.
The first seven sutras of the present uddeśaka describe the relationship with medicine etc. After that, from the eighth sutra to the thirty-fifth sutra, there is a description of the relationship with the study and teaching of the scriptures. The Stananga, Avashyakasutra, Vyavharasutra and Bahutkalpa also shed light on these matters in various places. The given recitation is clearly prohibited in this. Thus, there are only two topics discussed in the nineteenth uddeśaka. Twentieth uddeśaka
The twentieth uddeśaka has 51 sutras. There are 6272-6703 gathas in the commentary on them. There are provisions for various types of atonement for deceitful and sincere criticism. The practitioner who criticizes sincerely gets as much atonement as the practitioner who criticizes deceitfully gets one month more atonement. In the reign of Bhagwan Mahavira, there is only a provision for atonement for six months. These sutras are similar to the first twenty sutras of the Vyavharasutra. It describes the atonement by telling various bhangs. The criticism of the places of atonement, the giving of atonement and the establishment of grace and disgrace during the time of its carrying are clearly described.
It should be remembered that according to the nishith appointment and commentary, the sutra number of nishith is 2022. But in the present edition, the total sutra number is 1401. The sutra number is not the same in all the available copies of the nishith sutra. The difference in the number of 621 sutras in the appointment and commentary is investigable for researchers.
Offense and Atonement Law - From a Buddhist Perspective
There are two streams of Shraman culture - one is Jain culture and the other is Buddhist culture. We have already mentioned in the above lines that in the Jain method of sadhana, if there are any lapses, there is a provision for atonement etc. in the nishith etc. chedasutras to get rid of that lapse. First, a long list of possible lapses is given and then atonement is provided for the purification of those lapses. The place of nishith in the Jain tradition is the same as the place of Vinayapitaka in the Buddhist tradition. The 'Vinayapitaka' gives the constitution of the Buddhist Sangha. Conduct has a glorious place in the life of a bhikkhu. The Tathagata Buddha preached the rules to be followed by the bhikkhus and bhikkhunis from time to time. The present context also describes offenses, faults and atonements. This book has its own importance in guiding society and life. The Vinayapitaka is divided into three parts from the point of view of Vinayavastu - (1) Suttabhanga, (2) Khandaka, (3) Parivara.

The Suttavibhanga describes the faults and violations of rules that monks were expected to remember on the new and full moon days of each month. This is also known as the Prati-moksha. From the perspective of monks and nuns, there are two divisions of Prati-moksha, describing the violations of rules by monks and nuns. When the recitation of Prati-moksha begins, the monks and nuns present in the assembly stand up and confess to the offenses mentioned in the text. The purpose of this confession is to prevent the repetition of such offenses in the future. In the Majjhima Nikaya, the Tathagata Buddha clearly stated that Prati-moksha is the beginning, the mouth, of virtuous deeds. Commenting on the word Prati-moksha, an Acharya wrote that it protects those who uphold its rules, freeing them from suffering, misery, and other evils.

The Khandhaka is also divided into two parts: the Mahavagga and the Cullavagga. The Mahavagga describes the nature of the monastic life of a monk and the rules he must follow. While the Suttavibhanga primarily uses a negative style, the Mahavagga employs an affirmative style. It elaborates on the procedures and rules for Upasampada, Varshavas, Prati-moksha (Pati-mokkha), Pravarana, Chivarrangana, etc.

The Cullavagga discusses daily conduct, what is appropriate and inappropriate, how to walk, how to speak, etc. It also includes a collection of significant events from Buddhist history.

The beginning of the Vinaya Pitaka provides an index of the topics discussed.

The Tathagata Buddha instructed his chief disciple Ananda to forgive minor mistakes. However, Ananda forgot to ask the Buddha what constituted minor mistakes. After the Tathagata Buddha's Parinirvana, to prevent the disintegration of the Sangha and preserve the sanctity of the Dharma Sangha, strict rules were established during the First Buddhist Council. The primary objective was to keep monks and nuns away from evil deeds. There were two types of punishments in the Buddhist Sangha: severe and lenient. Severe punishments included Parajika and other punishments like Sanghadisesa. These were known by various names like Duththalapaatti, Garukapaatti, Adesanagamini Aapatti, Thallavajja Aapatti, and Anavasesa Aapatti.

Lenient punishments were relatively milder. They were known as Adullapaatti, Lahukapaatti, Athallavajja Aapatti, Savasesa Aapatti, Desanagamini Aapatti, etc.

It is important to note that in the Jain tradition, there are different forms of atonement for monks and nuns, known as Niggantha or Nigganthini. Similarly, the Buddhist tradition also has separate provisions for both. In the Buddhist Sangha, there are two divisions: Bhikkhupati-mokkha and Bhikkhuni-pati-mokkha. The Bhikkhupati-mokkha has a larger number of rules. Currently, due to the unavailability of texts related to Bhikkhupati-mokkha, we are discussing this topic based on Bhikkhuni-pati-mokkha.

He could not stay. He could not stop the Uposatha and Pravarana, nor could he blame anyone or punish anyone. There was no provision for the punishment of Parivasa for the Bhikshuni. The inscriptions of Ashoka in the third century BC describe both the Bhikshu and the Bhikshuni being sent to the Anavasasthan for breaking the Sangha. According to Buddhaghosa, Chetiyagha (cremation ground), Bodhidhara (Bodhigriha), Sammajjanivattak (bathing house), Daru-Prattak (wood making place), Paniyamal (veranda), Vachhakutti (toilet) and Dvarakottak (door chamber) were Anavasasthan.
Dr. Arun Pratap Singh believes that there was a provision for the punishment of Parivasa for the Bhikshunis in the Buddhist Sangha. This is clear from the inscriptions of Emperor Ashoka. But later the Sangha must have seen that staying in the Anavasasthan would create a problem in protecting the Shila of the Bhikshunis. Therefore, the provision must have been changed.
The Theravadinikaya mentions 166 Pacittiya (penance) rules for the Bhikshunis, while the Mahasanghikanikaya mentions 949 Pacittiya Dharma. There it is called pure Pacittik Dharma. The Pacittiya rules are almost the same in both. Some of these rules are related to misdeeds. Penance was given for having bad feelings in the mind or for doing bad deeds. Some rules were for giving penance for speaking harsh words to Buddhism and the Sangha or any other person. Some rules were for giving penance for sexual offenses. Penance was given for committing offenses related to handwork, applying oil, ghee etc. to the secret organ and artificial intercourse. Some rules were for giving penance for offenses related to violence. Some rules were related to killing, beating and torturing, taunting, suicide and weapons etc. Some rules were for giving penance for offenses related to theft. Some rules were for giving penance for offenses related to the Sangha. To have relations with a person expelled from the Sangha. Not following the Sangha's code of conduct. Many rules are related to offenses related to food. Eating at night. Consumption of ghee, oil, honey, meat, fish, butter, garlic by a healthy Bhikshuni. Roasting raw grains and eating them. Feeding a householder or a wanderer with one's own hand. Eating at the wrong time, wandering around the houses of householders for delicious food. Some rules are related to clothes. Keeping clothes bigger or smaller than the measure. Spinning yarn etc. is prohibited and some rules are related to self-study.
Learning mantras and other knowledge is prohibited. He has to accept the essence of Dharma only, not other useless things.
In short, whether it is the Jain tradition, the Buddhist tradition or the Vedic tradition, all have considered sexual intercourse, theft and violence as the most serious crimes. Both the Jain and Buddhist traditions have given great importance to the Sangha.

It is also a great offense to disregard the Sangha and the Sangha Nayak. One Jainacharya has even written that when the Tirthankara is in Samavasarana, he salutes the Sangha by saying "Namo Sanghass". Both Jain and Buddhist traditions have been very careful that no ineligible person should be initiated, as entry can lead to immorality. Jain and Buddhist monks and nuns are equal, and there are many similarities in the system of severe penance. There are also many similarities in the traditions. It is true that the Buddhist tradition has been a middle path, so its code of conduct is also based on the middle path. The Jain tradition has emphasized age and rigorous practice. Therefore, its code of conduct is also strict.

A special feature is that in Jainism, penance is given according to the offense, taking into account the circumstances. If a seeker commits an offense willingly, repeatedly, does not admit the offense in front of the gurus, or consumes intoxicants, then there was a provision for severe punishment. And if the same offense has been committed unknowingly or due to special circumstances, and if he admits the offense sincerely in front of the gurus, then he is given less penance. But there was no such provision for penance in Buddhism. Of the ten penances in Jainism, there are penances like Pralaochana, Pratikramana, Kayotsarga, etc., which the seeker has to perform in the morning and evening. He has to confess these sins before the guru. But in Buddhism, there was no such mandatory rule to perform Pralaochana, Pratikramana and Kayotsarga daily and to be free from penance. There, the vows of the Patimokkha rules were recited on the fifteenth day during Uposatha. Therefore, in the Buddhist Sangha, information about the offense was received after fifteen days. During the annual Pavarana, the offense seen, heard and doubted was investigated.

Thus, we see that it is human nature to commit offenses. Due to a little carelessness, mistakes happen. But the system of penance in Jain and Buddhist traditions for the purification of these mistakes is easy and simple. But in the Vedic tradition's system of penance, the system of punishment has also been included. As a result, there was also a provision for amputation, etc. While there are no such provisions in Jain and Buddhist traditions. The offense and penance system is from the Vedic point of view...

Indian culture has a stream of Vedic tradition. On the same land, the Shraman culture and the Vedic culture have flowed. The great sages of the Vedic culture have also made various provisions for liberation from sin. The inner mind of the sages of the Rigveda also has a strong desire to be free from sin. Thinking has been done from various perspectives regarding the number of sins, their various types. The Rigveda states that seven limits have been told for the wise or the Vishas. He who transgresses even one of them is a sinner. In the Taittiriya Samhita, Shatapatha Brahmana and other Brahmana texts, Brahmanahत्या has been considered the greatest sin.

I consider abortion to be a greater sin than Brahmanicide. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad considers thieves and abortionists to be great sinners. The Vasishtha Sutra divides sinners into three categories: 1. Ansavi, 2. Mahapataki, 3. Upapataki. Ansavi refers to ordinary sinners. Specific atonement is prescribed for them. According to Vasishtha, there are five Mahapatakas (1) Defiling the bed of a Guru (2) Drinking liquor (3) Killing a fetus (4) Stealing the gold of a Brahmin (5) Contact with an outcast. Upapataki is one who abandons Agnihotra. He incurs the wrath of his Guru by his misdeeds. He earns his livelihood from atheists. It is true that there have been different opinions regarding these categories of sins. Due to the fear of expansion, we are not discussing all of them and their opinions here. The descriptions of Brahmanicide, drinking liquor, theft, sexual intercourse with the Guru's wife, etc. are found in detail in Agni Purana, Prayaschittaviveka, Dharmasatra, Manusmriti, etc. Narada says that if a person has sexual intercourse with his mother, maternal aunt, mother-in-law, paternal aunt, sister-in-law, aunt, friend's wife, disciple's wife, sister, sister's friend, wife's sister, teacher's wife, woman of the same gotra, midwife, fasting woman and Brahmin woman, he becomes guilty of the sin of Gurutalpa adultery. There is no punishment other than castration for such a misdeed.
After committing various sins, people started praising Aditi, Mitra, Varuna, etc. to save themselves from those sins. Fearing the consequences of their crimes, they also started performing various kinds of vows, etc. According to the Rig Veda, the first ritual for atonement for sin was prayer for mercy, praise to avoid sin, and sacrifice to get rid of the consequences of serious sins. The Taittiriya Samhita Shatapatha Brahmana states that by performing Ashvamedha, the gods freed the king from sin. Another means of getting rid of sin was confession of sin.
The Gautama Dharma Sutra, Vasishtha Smriti states that Japa, Tapa, Homa, fasting and charity are the atonements for misdeeds. Acharya Manu has written that by confessing the crime and repenting, performing Tapa, chanting Gayatri mantras, the sinner is freed from the crime. If he cannot do this, he is freed by charity. The same thing is mentioned in Parashara Shatatapasmriti, Bhavishya Purana. The Shatapatha Brahmana clearly states that whoever

A person's sin is reduced when they confess it. Confession of one's transgression is the first step towards atonement. This is called *Aalocna* in Jain tradition. The *Gautama Dharma Sutra* and *Manusmriti* state that a student in the *Brahmacharya Ashram* who commits the sin of sexual intercourse should declare their fault while begging for alms in seven houses.

It is not as bad to commit a sin as it is to not recognize it as a sin. *Manusmriti*, *Vishnu Dharmaottar*, and *Brahma Purana* clearly state that the more a person's mind abhors their wrongdoing, the more their body is freed from sin. If a person does not repent after committing a sin, they cannot be freed from it. They should resolve in their mind that they will not repeat the act. The *Prayaschittaviveka Grantha* provides a remedy by Angira: If a person is immersed in remorse after committing sins and repents day and night, they become purified through *Pranayama*. *Prayaschittaprakash* believes that repentance alone is not enough to remove sins, but it makes the sinner eligible for atonement.

*Manusmriti*, *Bodhayana Dharma Sutra*, *Vasishtha Smriti*, and *Abhisankha Smriti* state that if a person performs sixteen *Pranayamas* with *Omkar* daily, they are freed from the sin of abortion after a month. *Vishnu Dharma Sutra* also states that the proper performance of three *Pranayamas* destroys all sins committed during the day or night. The *Chandogya Upanishad* and *Mundaka Upanishad* consider penance to be superior to sacrifice. Gautama has outlined the following durations of penance according to the nature of the sin: one year, six months, three months, two months, one month, twenty-four days, twelve days, six days, three days, and one night. Acharya Manu has declared:

Those who are guilty of great sins and other misdeeds are freed from sin by right austerities. In the Jain practice, various types of austerities are mentioned for liberation from sin.
The Vedic sages have described many ways to be free from sin, such as homa, japa practice, charity, fasting, pilgrimage, etc.
In Vedic literature, the words *prāyaścitti* and *prāyaścitta* are used. The word *prāyaścitti* is used many times in the Taittiriya Samhita. This word is used there in the sense of atonement for sin. The word *prāyaścitta* is used in the Atharva Veda, Vajasaneyi Samhita, 4 Aitireya Brahmana, Shatapatha Brahmana, Kaushitaki Brahmana. Both the words *prāyaścitti* and *prāyaścitta* are given in the Apastamba Srautasutra and Shankhayana Srautasutra. In the *Prāyaścittaviveka* text, the etymology of *prāyaścitta* is *prāyaḥ-tapa* and *citta-sankalpa*, meaning that *prāyaścitta* is related to the resolve of austerity for the removal of sin. In the *Bāgbhaṭṭo Yājñavalkya Smṛti*, the meaning of *prāyaḥ* is sin and the meaning of *citta* is purification. Hemadri 2, quoting the explanation of an unknown commentator, has written that the meaning of *prāyaḥ* is destruction and the meaning of *cit* is reconciliation. That is, the meaning of *prāyaścitta* is to make up for what has been lost. Therefore, it is a necessary action for the destruction of sin.
Brihaspati 3 and other scholars have classified sin into two types. One is *kāmakṛta*, that is, which is done intentionally. The other is *akāmakṛta*, which happens unintentionally. *Akāmakṛta* sins can be destroyed by *prāyaścitta*. But can *kāmakṛta* sin be destroyed by *prāyaścitta*? There has been a lot of disagreement among scholars on this matter. In the Manusmriti 4 and the Yājñavalkya Smṛti 5, it is clearly stated that *prāyaścitta* or the study of the Vedas destroys sins committed unintentionally. The Yājñavalkya Smṛti 16 states that knowingly 

Page #65:
---------------------------
4.  Penance does not destroy sins committed knowingly, but if the sinner performs penance, he becomes worthy of coming into contact with other people. Manu has also written - He should not come into contact with the wise until he has performed penance. The Smritis have provided for penance for the atonement of sins here and there. In the Gautama Dharma Sutra, Vasishtha Smriti, 3 Manusmriti, Yajnavalkya Smriti, those great sages have prescribed that one who has committed adultery with his mother, sister, daughter-in-law, etc., should have his testicles and penis cut off and should walk in the south or south-west direction until his body falls on the ground. Acharya Manu has written that a thief should go to the king with a pestle or mace or a sharp weapon, which was a kind of spear, or an iron rod, and declare his crime. If he dies or survives half-dead after being beaten once by the king, he is freed from the crime of theft.
In the Vedic tradition, the literature on penance has been very vast. The reason for this was that penance was of great importance to the common people in ancient times. See, out of 28 chapters of Gautama Dharma Sutra, 10 chapters describe penance. Out of 30 chapters printed in Vasishtha Dharma Sutra, 9 chapters are full of description of penance. There are a total of 222 verses in Manusmriti related to penance. Yajnavalkya Smriti chapter 3 has 1009 verses. Out of these, 122 verses are based on penance. Shatatap Smriti has only 274 verses describing penance. The same is mentioned in the Puranas as well. For example, Agni Purana (chapters 168-174), Garuda Purana 52, Kurma Purana (latter half 30-34), Varaha Purana (131-136), Brahmanda Purana (Upasangarapada chapter 9), Vishnu Dharmaottaramrita (2, 73, 3/234-237) describe penance. Mitakshara, Aparak Parasharamaadhaviya etc. commentaries have also discussed penance in detail. In addition to these, there are detailed descriptions of penance in Prayaschittaprakaran, Prayaschittaviveka, Prayaschittatattva, Smritimuktaphal (Prayaschitta related chapter), Prayaschittasar, Prayaschittamayukha, Prayaschittaprakash, Prayaschittendusekhar.
It should also be remembered that penance was not the same for all people. Even for the same crime, there was a difference in giving penance. The severity and duration of penance depended on whether the person was committing the crime for the first time or for many times. There was a council that provided penance. They would decide the penance according to the gravity and nature of the crime of the offender. There were four main levels of penance. (1) Going to the council or (2) Proper penance proclamation by the council, (3) Performance of penance, (4) Publication of the sinner's atonement.

The Vedic texts mention various types of penances and their methods. We are highlighting some of them. This penance involves standing in water and reciting the Aghmarsha mantras three times a day. This penance is mentioned in the Rig Veda, Bodhayana Dharma Sutra, Vasishtha Smriti, Manusmriti, Yajnavalkya Smriti, Vishnu Purana, Shankha Smriti, etc.

The second is the Atikachch penance. According to Acharya Manu, it involves eating only one mouthful of food in the morning and one mouthful in the evening for three days, then eating one mouthful of food without asking for three more days, and finally fasting for three days.

The Atisantapan penance lasts for eighteen days. It involves eating cow's urine and five other substances for six days.

The Ardhakruchch penance lasts for six days. It involves eating only once a day, then eating only in the evening, then eating without asking for two days, and finally fasting completely.

In the Gomutra Kruchch penance, a cow is fed barley and wheat, and then the number of grains that come out of the cow's dung is used to make a porridge and dumplings in cow's urine.

The Chandrayan penance involves eating according to the waxing and waning of the moon. The Bodhayana Dharma Sutra mentions two types of Chandrayan penance: Yavamdhya, which is thick in the middle and thin at both ends like barley, and Pipilikamdhya, which is thin in the middle and thick at both ends like an ant. Manusmriti, Yajnavalkya Smriti, and Vasishtha Smriti define Chandrayan Yavamdhya as follows: one mouthful on the first day of the bright fortnight, 

Page #67:
---------------------------
On the second day, two, in this way, on the full moon, fifteen *grasa* of food are taken. In the same way, in the dark fortnight, on the first day, fourteen *grasa*, reducing one *grasa* each day, on the fourteenth day, one *grasa* is eaten, and on the new moon, a fast is observed. If someone starts the fast from the first day of the dark fortnight, then on the first day, he eats fourteen *grasa* and gradually reduces the *grasa*. On the fourteenth day, he eats one *grasa* and on the new moon, he does not eat even one *grasa*, then on the first day of the bright fortnight, he takes one *grasa* and increases it, eating fifteen *grasa* on the full moon. In this situation, the month is *purnamantha*. In this sequence, there is not even one *grasa* in the middle of the fast. The number of *grasa* is more at the beginning and end. This atonement is called *pipilikamdhya chandrayan*. There are various types mentioned in relation to the *chandrayan* fast.

In this way, various types of austerities are mentioned in the scriptures for removing various atonements. We are not mentioning all of them here, but we are suggesting that you read the history of Dharma Shastra, Part 3, written by Dr. Pandurang Vaman Kane. There is a detailed discussion and debate on this.

## Commentary Literature *Nishithanuyukti*

*Nishitha* has a very glorious place in the *Chhedasutras*. To express the secrets contained in it, commentary literature has been created on it from time to time. First, a commentary in Prakrit language was written in verse form. That commentary is famous as *Nishithanuyukti*. In it, the main focus is on the explanation of technical terms, not on the explanation of each verse of the original text. This style of commentary is based on the *nikshepa* method. In the *nikshepa* method, after giving many possible meanings of a single word, the non-presented meanings are negated and the presented meaning is accepted. This method has been very popular in jurisprudence. *Bhadrabahuswami* considered this method suitable for *sikti*. He has written in *Aavashyakaniyukti* that a word has many meanings, but which meaning is appropriate for which context. Which meaning was associated with which word at the time of the teachings of *Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira*, etc., keeping all these things in mind, it is necessary to decide the meaning correctly. And the purpose of *niyukti* is to establish the relationship of that meaning with the words of the original text. In other words, *niyukti* is a commentary that explains the definite relationship between the text and the meaning. Or, *niyukti* is a method that explains the meaning with certainty. The famous German scholar *Sarpeentier*, while defining *niyukti*, has written that "niyuktis only work as an index of their main part. They briefly mention all the detailed events."

In *Nishithanuyukti* also, the words of the text have been explained using the *nikshepa* method. The verses of the present *niyukti* are:

1. *Lama*
2. *Aavashyakaniyukti*, verse 88
3. *Sutrarthayo: parasparam niyojan sambandhan niyukti:*
    - *Aavashyakaniyukti*, verse 83
4. *Nischyena arthapratipadikayukti: niyukti:*
    - *Acharangani*, 1/2/1

The commentary (bhāṣya) has been found. Where the commentator (charṇikāra) points this out, it is revealed that this is the story of the appointment (niyukti) and this is the story of the commentary. In this appointment, the conduct of the ascetics (śramaṇācāra) has been depicted. - Niśīthabhāṣya

The style of explanation of the appointments was extremely profound and concise. Its main goal was to explain technical terms. To reveal the deep secrets of the appointments, a poetic explanation in the Prakrit language, similar to the appointments, was written, which is known as the commentary. The commentators are the first to be credited with expressing the abundance of meaning hidden in the words of the appointments. The author of the commentary on Niśītha, Śrī Saṅghdāsaga, has many verses of the commentary in the Bṛhatkalpa and Vyavahāra Bhāṣya. There are also many interesting and witty stories. The conduct of the ascetics has been depicted from various perspectives. For example, the Pūlindas, etc., who were non-Aryan, killed the ascetics, mistaking them for Aryans, while they were going into the forest. The merchants went to distant countries for trade. In that era, many types of coins were in circulation. The commentary mentions the names of Bṛhatkalpa, Nandī Sūtra, Siddhasena, and Govinda-vācaka, etc. - Niśīthachūṇi

After the commentary, the Jain ācāryas decided to write prose commentary literature. They composed commentaries in pure Prakrit and in Prakrit mixed with Sanskrit. The commentary which is famous by the name of charṇi. Two commentaries were created on Niśītha, but only one is available today. The author of the Niśīthachūṇi is Jinadāsagaṇi Mahātara. This commentary is called the special commentary. This commentary discusses the original sūtra, the appointment, and the commentary verses. The language of this commentary is Prakrit mixed with Sanskrit.

We have presented a brief summary of the twenty purposes of Niśītha in the previous lines. That summary is given according to the original Niśītha āgama. In the Niśīthachūṇi, the commentator has given some new facts from his own side to clarify the original meaning of Niśītha. Therefore, we are giving here the essence of what is found in the Niśīthachūṇi, so this is not repetition. The reader will experience for themselves how the commentator has clarified the subject.

The commentator has first saluted the Arhant, Siddha, and Sadhus, and also saluted the meaning-giver, Pradyumna Mahāśramaṇa. The ācārya, agra, prakalpa, calikā, and Niśītha have all been contemplated by the method of deposition (nikṣepa paddhati). The meaning of Niśītha is aprakāśa + andhakāra. The Niśīthasūtra is for the correct judgment of unilluminated words. In common parlance, Niśītha is used for the darkness of night. Other meanings of Niśītha have also been given. Niśītha is that which destroys all types of karma-dust.

The description of the first person servant (pratisevaka) is given. After that, the nature of service (pratisevana) and the one to be served (pratisevitavya) is explained, and then the topics of non-negligence service (apramāda-pratisevana), simultaneous cognition (sahasātkarana), negligent service (pramāda-pratisevana), anger, etc., passions (kaṣāya), the contradiction of knowledge, vision, and conduct (jñāna-darśana-cāritra), false speech (vikathā), senses (indriya), sleep (nidrā), etc., are discussed. The more one indulges in laziness, sexual intercourse, sleep, hunger, and anger, the more they increase like the cloth of Draupadi.

Sthāna-nidrā is that in which the intense obscuring karma of vision (darśanāvaraṇa karma) arises. The sleep in which the mind becomes stiff or fixed is sthāna-nidrā. To clarify its nature, the commentator has given the examples of a particle (pudgala), a sweetmeat (modaka), a potter (kumbhakāra), and an elephant's tusk (hastidanta).

The treatise on the six types of livelihood, the faults associated with them, exceptions, and atonement has been discussed in the preface. Considerations have been given to questions, food, clothing, shelter, movement, sleep, travel, speech, departure, arrival, etc.

While discussing the violence against living beings, false speech has been divided into two parts: worldly and transcendental. The worldly false speech includes the narratives of four cunning individuals: Shashka, Elaashaadh, Mooldev, and Khindpaana. The basis of this narrative of cunning is the ancient story of Dhurtākhyāna by Acharya Haribhadra. Following this, there is a description of transcendental false speech, accepting gifts without giving, sexual intercourse, possession, and nighttime meals, which are divided into two parts: Dapiika and Kalpika. Dapiika describes the faults associated with these subjects and prohibits their consumption. Kalpika describes their exceptions. After the description of the primary virtues, there is a description of the secondary virtues. It includes the description of purification of the body, etc. The conclusion of the preface highlights that the essence of the Nisheetha Pithika should only be given to the learned, not to the unworthy.

The first section elaborates on the fourth great vow. It sheds light on accepting five types of Chilmilka, their evidence, and usage. It also discusses the stick and its utility. The rules and regulations for tearing clothes, sewing, etc., have also been mentioned.

The second section prohibits the acceptance of foot-washing water, the use of fragrant substances, harsh language, and bathing, etc. It also prohibits praising the giver before and after giving. There are 64 types of material substances. These include 24 types of grains like barley, wheat, rice, etc.; 24 types of gems like gold, copper, silver, iron, lead, gold, stone, berry, gem, pearl, coral, conch, tin, agarwood, sandalwood, silk cloth, wood, teeth, leather, hair, fragrance, medicinal substances, etc.; three types of immovable objects like land, house, tree; two types of bipeds like carts, etc., and humans; ten types of quadrupeds like cow, camel, buffalo, goat, sheep, horse, mare, stallion, donkey, elephant; and the 64th is a cooking utensil.

The body of a person who has died in bed is not acceptable. Accepting it results in the atonement of a small fast. The treatise discusses the following: (1) Who is a Saagarika? (2) When does he become a Shayyatar? (3) Types of his body, (4) When does he become a non-Shayyatar? (5) How can a Saagarika be avoided by a restrained person? (6) Faults associated with accepting the body of a Saagarika, (7) Under what circumstances can the body of a Saagarika be accepted? (8) Accepting it with care, (9) Accepting it from one or many Saagarikas, etc. There are five types of Saagarikas: Saagarika, Shayyatar, giver, house, and body. While explaining the difference between a bed and a mattress, it is stated that the bed is equal to the entire body, and the mattress is two and a half hands long. It also elaborates on its various types.

While discussing the topic of Upadhi, it mentions two types: Avadhiyukt and Upgrihit. For Jinakalpikas, there are twelve types of Upadhi Avadhiyukt, for Sthavirakalpika, there are fourteen types, and for Sadhvis, there are twenty-five types. Jinakalpika are of two types: Paanipatra Bhoji and Pratigrahadhari. There are eight categories of the period of Jinakalpika. They have two, three, four, five, nine, ten, eleven, and twelve types. The naked Paanipatra is the most inferior... 

Page #70:
---------------------------
There are two types of Upadhi Rajoharan and Mukhavastrika. If the Panipatras are fully clothed and accept a cloth, then there are three types of them.
The third Uddeshak discusses the faults that occur during Bhikshagrahan and the atonement for their purification. It also contemplates other faults.
The fourth Uddeshak describes favorable and unfavorable upsargas, various types of Kayotsarga, Samachari, the entry of a Shraman in place of a Nirgranthi, the characteristics of a king, minister, merchant, priest, caravan leader, village headman, national headman, and Ganadhar, the service of a sick Shramani, the difference between Sanrambh, Samarabh, and Prarabh, humor and its various causes.
The fifth Uddeshak describes the different types of Prabhutik beds, coverings, etc., and the Saparikarma bed and its fourteen types. The interaction between Jain Shramans regarding food, etc., is called Sambhog in Jain technical terms, and the relationship is called Sambhogik Sambandh. The Churnikar has given some historical anecdotes to explain the Sambhogik Sambandh, such as: Bhagwan Mahavira, his disciple Sudharma, his Jambu, his Prabhav, his Shayambhav, his Yashobhdra, his Sambhut, his Sthulbhadra, Sthulbhadra's Arya Mahagir, and Prarya Suhasti, these two were the main disciples of the era. Chandragupta's son Bindusara, his son Ashoka, and his son Kunal.
The sixth Uddeshak describes Guru Chaturmasik. Its main subject is the faults related to sexual intercourse and atonement.

The tenth Uddeshak discusses the excessiveness, harshness, etc., of language and describes its atonement. It also details the faults and atonement of religious food, the fickleness of the sick, their suffering, and the atonement for neglecting them. The synonyms for Varshavas and Paryushana are given. The story of Saraswati, the sister of Aryakalaka, who was extremely beautiful, being abducted by King Gardhabhilla of Ujjayini, is narrated.

The eleventh Uddeshak discusses the acceptance of vessels. It categorizes fear into four types: (1) fear arising from Pisachas, etc., (2) fear arising from humans, etc., (3) fear arising from plants, and (4) fear arising suddenly. It then describes seven fears related to this world, the next world, etc.

It prohibits ineligible initiation, stating that eighteen types of men, twenty types of women, and ten types of eunuchs are ineligible. It categorizes child initiation into three types: (1) a child of seven or eight years is an excellent child, (2) a child of five or six years is a medium child, and (3) a child of four years or less is an inferior child. All these are ineligible for initiation. A child older than eight years is considered eligible for initiation. It also describes the various types of ineligible individuals for initiation, such as the elderly, the sick, the insane, and the foolish. Sixteen types of diseases and eight types of ailments are described as per the context. The difference between an ailment and a disease is that an ailment is cured quickly, while a disease takes a long time to cure. Child death and the death of a learned person are also analyzed in detail.

The twelfth Uddeshak describes the bondage and liberation, rejection, breaking, etc., related to the Trisaprani.

The thirteenth Uddeshak discusses Kayotsarga on smooth earth, stone, etc., harsh words to a householder, mantras, benefits and losses, the location of the dhatu, performing Vaman Virechan Pratikarmas, praising and honoring the neighbor, consuming Dhatripinda, Dootipinda, Nimittapinda, Chikitsapinda, and Krodhadipinda, all of which are eligible for Chaturlaghu atonement.

The fourteenth Uddeshak describes the faults related to vessels and prescribes atonement for liberation from them.

The fifteenth Uddeshak prohibits Shramanas and Shramanis from eating with a conscious mind. It describes four types of raw mangoes: Ussetim, Sansetim, Uvakkhad, and Paliy, and four types of ripe mangoes. It also sheds light on the method of accepting Talapralamb from the perspective of Shramanas and Shramanis.

The sixteenth Uddeshak prohibits Shramanas from wearing body ornaments and excessively bright robes. Shramanas and Shramanis should reside in places where their celibacy is not violated.

Food should not be accepted from a despised or disgusting family. There are two types of despised families: Itvarik and Yavatkathik. Families with Sutak, etc., are despised for a certain period. Blacksmiths, distillers, and leatherworkers are Yavatkathik-despised families.

The Aryadesh extends from Magadha in the east to Sthuna in the west, and from Kaushambi in the south to Kunala in the north, where Shramanas should wander. This is also the belief of the commentator.

The seventeenth Uddeshak describes the nature of songs, humor, music, dance, and acting, and considers their practice unsuitable for Shramanas, prescribing atonement for it. 

Page #72:
---------------------------
The eighteenth Uddeshak has discussed the faults related to boats. It describes the atonement for boarding a boat, buying a boat, taking a boat from water to land and land to water, filling or emptying water in a boat, rowing a boat, tying a rope to a boat, etc.
The nineteenth Uddeshak has discussed about Swadhyay (self-study) and Adhyapan (teaching). It highlights the time, non-time, subject of Swadhyay, faults incurred by doing Swadhyay during non-time, faults incurred by teaching an ineligible person, a person with side-effects and a greedy person, and faults incurred by not teaching an eligible person.
The twentieth Uddeshak has discussed about monthly and other observances, counter-consumption, criticism, atonement, etc.
In the conclusion of the Churni, the author has mentioned his name as Jinadasgani Mahttar and the name of the Churni as Visheshchurni.
This Churni holds a special place in Churnisahitya. It contains a detailed explanation of the rules and opinions of conduct. It is a unique collection of ancient cultural, social, and philosophical material of India. It is a beautiful collection of many historical and mythological stories. The stories of Dhurtakhyan, Tarangavati, Malayavati, Magadhasen, Aryakalak, etc. are inspiring.
Nishithchurnidurgapadavyakhya
There were two Acharyas named Shri Chandrasuri in the Jain tradition. One was a disciple of Maldhari Hemchandrasuri, while the other was a disciple of the Guru couple Shri Sheelbhadrasuri and Dhaneshwarasuri. His other name was Parsvadevgan. He wrote a commentary called Nishith Churnidurgapadavyakhya on the twentieth Uddeshak of Nishoshan. It was written to make the difficult parts of the Churni simple and easy, as the commentator himself has admitted. But this commentary has become monotonous due to its discussion on the types of months, days, etc.
Along with this, the second Nishith, named 'Ek Adhyayan', was written by Pandit Dalsukh Bhai Malvaniya from the Shuvingsutra Lai.
The edition of Nishiyasutra Bhashya, Churni, and Parishista in four parts edited by Lalji M. 'Kamal' was also published from Agra. A detailed preface was also written on it, which is an introduction to his serious study. It was published in 1918 by the Jain Sahitya Sanshodhak Samiti, Pune. The first Hindi translation of Nishithsutra along with the original text was done by Acharya Amolka Rishiji M., which was published by Sukhdev Sahay Jwalaprasad Johari, Hyderabad, Veer Samvat 2446. Acharya Pravar Shri Ghasilalji M. has written a commentary on Nishith in Sanskrit language, which was published by Jain Shastroddhar Samiti, Rajkot. Dharmopadeishta Phulchandji M. 'Pupphabhikkhu' published the original text of thirty-two Agamas in two parts of Suttagame. The original text of Nishiy was published in it. In the book called Navsutani, the original text of Nishihbhanyan was also published in the edition done by Yuvacharya Mahaprajnajji under the leadership of Acharya Shri Tulsiji. It also contains variations in the text. Thus, Nishith has been published from various places till today. But no edition containing a discussion on Nishith has come out, which can reveal the secrets hidden in Nishith. The main reason for this is confidentiality.

## Present Edition

There has long been a need for a Hindi translation and commentary on the Nishīth Sūtra. The late Yuvacharya Mahāmānīchi Shri Madhukar Muni ji, in the prime of his life, presented the Āgama Publication Scheme. Due to the cooperation of many learned and generous individuals, this scheme quickly took shape. During his lifetime, many Prāgamas were published in a short period of time. Yuvacharya Madhukar Muni ji, in the beginning of the scheme, casually told his close friend, the expert in Āgama literature, the proponent of Dhanuyoga, the learned Pandit Shri Kanhaiyalal ji M. 'Kamal', that you should write the editing and commentary of the Muni Pravara Chhedasūtras. How could Kanhaiyalal ji M. refuse the request of the affectionate Madhukar Muni ji? He agreed, but who knew that the Yuvacharya Shri would suddenly pass away. His passing did cause some disruption, but the editorial board and publication committee were determined to complete this task. As a result, thirty-two Āgamas have been published.

Muni Shri Kanhaiyalal ji M. 'Kamal' has been dedicated to the service of the Shruta since his youth. He has published the voluminous works of Ganitānuyoga, Dharmakatānuyoga, and Charanakaranānuyoga in several volumes, after hard work. The publication of Dravyānuyoga is also going to be in several volumes. He has also done a brilliant editing of every Āgama. It was due to his hard work that the Nishīth Bhāshya and Vishēshachūrni were published from Agra. The translation and commentary of Nishīth has been written by a learned scholar, an expert in Āgama literature. The commentary reveals the author's excellent talent effortlessly. He has written a concise and comprehensive commentary in the light of ancient texts. It is his nature to reach the bottom of the subject and present it in beautiful and elegant language.

The original text of the Nishīth Sūtra is pure. The translation is so beautiful that the reader easily understands the subject while reading. The biggest feature of the translation is that it is fluent. Writing a commentary on an Āgama like Nishīth, which is full of profound secrets, is not a joke. His natural erudition is evident in them. Pandit Shri Tilak Muni ji's affectionate cooperation has also been received in the work of this present translation and commentary. Under the leadership of Kanhaiyalal ji M. 'Kamal', he dedicated himself to this editing work due to his ill health. The excellent talent of Kanhaiyalal ji M. 'Kamal' and the hard work of Tilak Muni ji, thus, through this combination of gem and gold, the editing of the book has been beautiful and quick.

It explains the concept of such places, the potential for them to be fathomable, and the similarity to the third uddeśaka. The sutras are interpreted as referring to the act of excreting waste. It also discusses the requirements for a sādhū's dwelling, the meaning of the terms "jugg-jaṇ," and the types of dwellings for a parivrājaka.

* **335-336:** This section discusses the prāyaścitta for taking clothes without investigation.
* **337-338:** This section explains the meaning of the words used in the sutras and the intention behind them. It also discusses the method of investigation.
* **338-340:** This section discusses the prāyaścitta for performing bodily functions for adornment. It explains the purpose of the sutras, the meaning of the sutras, and the potential for washing without adornment. It also lists the places in other āgamas that prohibit adornment.
* **340-341:** This section discusses which sutras are mentioned in other āgamas.
* **341:** This section discusses the prāyaścitta for staying in a prohibited bed.
* **342-344:** This section discusses the meaning of a prohibited bed, the types of prohibited beds, and the prāyaścitta for staying in such a bed. It also discusses the types of beds that are considered prohibited in modern times.
* **344-345:** This section discusses the prāyaścitta for eating and sucking sugarcane. It explains that this is a separate category from fruit, and that there are both prohibitions and regulations regarding sugarcane in the Prācārāṅga. It also discusses the difference between eating and sucking sugarcane, and the meaning of the words used in the sutras.

##  **Prāśama Uddesaka**
**The Atonement of the Veda-Mohoday**

1. **The monk who engages in manual labor or approves of those who do (incurs the Guru-Māsika atonement).**

**Discussion:**

Upon reading this sūtra, a curious student of the scriptures will naturally wonder why this sūtra appears at the very beginning of this Āgama. Shouldn't there be a mangalācaraṇa (auspicious invocation) or an utthānikā (introduction) at the start? This sūtra could have been placed elsewhere.

The answer lies in the compilation style of the Āgamas. They are structured to contain the desired topics from "ath" (beginning) to "iti" (end). For example, consider the Ācārāṅga, Sūtrakṛtāṅga,  Sthānāṅga, Samvāyāṅga, and the Br̥hatkalpa, Vyavahāra, etc. sūtras. These do not have mangalācaraṇa sūtras or utthānikās. This is because the Śruta Dharma (scriptural teachings) and Cāritra Dharma (ethical conduct) expounded in the Āgamas are themselves auspicious. Therefore, the Āgamas and each of their sūtras are auspicious in nature. Why then is there a need for an additional mangalācaraṇa?

Alternatively, atonement is a form of tapas (austerity). According to the Daśavaikālika sūtra, tapas is auspicious. Therefore, the Pūrṇa Niśītha sūtra, which outlines atonement, is itself auspicious. Hence, an additional mangalācaraṇa is unnecessary.

In this regard, thoughtful students of the Āgamas believe that the mangalācaraṇa sūtras or utthānikās found at the beginning or end of some Āgamas were added later by a devout follower of the Āgamas during the period of scriptural transcription or some other unknown time.

As evidence, consider the "Namo Bamṁbīe Livīe" invocation found at the beginning of the Bhagavati sūtra. This mangalācaraṇa in the form of a salutation originated during the period of scriptural transcription. Why would there be a need to salute the script as long as the scriptures were memorized and passed down orally? 

Page #106:
---------------------------
[Nishiy Sutra Shrutadevata Namaskara
In the same way, at the end of Bhagavati Sutra, the final auspiciousness in the form of salutations to Shrutadevata and other numerous gods and goddesses has been added in some era. The commentator Shri Abhaydevsuri has also not explained them as "Mangal" of the scribe.
It is not appropriate for a Vrati Shraman to salute an Avrati Shrutadevata Yaksha, some Agamjna Shrutadevata consider only Ganadhar, but Ganadhar are the creators of Sutragama themselves, therefore it does not seem logical for them to salute themselves.
When the scribes started copying the Agamas, one of the scribes must have written "Namo Bamhiye Liviye" at the beginning of Bhagavati, making it a Mangalacharan in the form of salutation, so that the copy of Bhagavati could be completed without any obstacles. Because Bhagavati has always been the greatest Agama. As many copies of that copy were made, this script of salutation Mangalacharan Sutra became permanent in them.
Although the scribes did not write in Brahmi script, they still had the belief that the original script was "Brahmi script", and saluting it would give us prosperity in the profession of writing. The Uththani Kayas used in the beginning
The recitation of the available Agamas is considered to be the recitation of Sudharmaswami, the introduction of them and the description of their conduct in their recitation, as described in these Uththani Kayas, can be understood by a common reader that these Uththani Kayas are the work of someone else.
The writing style of the Uththani Karas itself makes it clear, for example, here is a part of the Uththani Ka:
"Teṇam kāleṇam teṇam samaeṇam samaṇassa bhagavao mahāvīrassā antevāsī ajjasuhhamme ṇāma there jāisampanne jāv gāmaṇugāmaṁ dūijjमाणe suhaṁ suheṇam viharaमाणe jeṇev campaṇayaro jeṇev puṇṇabhadde ceie teṇāmev uvāgaccahi." - Jnatadharmakatha A. 1, S. 1.
At that time, at that time, the Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira's Antavasin Arya Sudharma, a Thera of noble lineage, was wandering from village to village, dwelling happily and happily, where Champanagari was, where the Punnabhadra Chaitya was, he came there.
After reading this part of the Uththani Ka, a knowledgeable reader should decide for himself whether these Uththani Kayas are compiled by Sudharmaswami himself? If not, then it is certain that they were added later. Therefore, the Mangalacharan Sutra and Uththani Kayas in the Sutras are not original creations.
Therefore, in this Nishith Sutra, without mentioning the Mangalacharan Sutra and Uththani Ka Sutra, it has been called the Sutra of atonement for the rise of Vedamohaniya.
In the worship of the Anugar Dharma, the worship of the Brahmacharya Mahavrat is very difficult. By fully observing this one, it is possible to fully observe all the Mahavratas, and by breaking this one, it is certain that all the Mahavratas will be broken.

## First Uddeshak

[7]

The importance of this Mahavrat is such that even Gods, Demons, Humans, etc. all bow down before its complete observer. 
_ The scriptures contain a detailed description of its greatness and the factors that facilitate and hinder its practice. 
This first atonement sutra has been presented in this scripture with the intention that the Sadhus and Sadhvis who observe this Mahavrat remain constantly vigilant against the actions of transgression, etc., which may arise due to the sudden and powerful emergence of Vedamoha. 
Some sutras in the Brihatkalpa Sutra Uddeshak 3-4-5 use only the male-centric term "Bhikshu or Shraman Nirgrath". However, these regulations are applicable to both Bhikshus and Bhikshuni. The Acharang Sutra uses both the terms Bhikshu, Bhikshuni and the Brihatkalpa Sutra uses both Nigranth and Nirgranthi. There can be many types of writing styles, but wherever the meaning is relevant, it is understood. 
Except for some sutras in the seventeenth Uddeshak of the Nishisth Sutra, the atonement statements are generally made using only the term "Bhikshu". However, one should understand the appropriate atonement regulations for Sadhvis by implication. 
Due to the distorted thoughts arising from the Vibhavadasha born from Hattakkam-Ved-Mohodaya, the intention of manual labor is carried out. 
To understand the detailed description of its negative consequences and the ways to get rid of it, one should study the commentary and the Churni with discernment. 
In the Karei, Karentam va Saizzai-Sutra, the action of getting something done is not mentioned. "Getting something done" is also a type of approval, because approval is certain in getting something done, which also includes the action of getting something done. The Churnikar has also explained it as "Saizjana duviha-karavane, anumoadane". And from the statement of the beginning and the end, the middle can also be understood. Therefore, wherever the text "Karei, Karentam va Saizzai" is present, one should understand it as "does or gets it done or approves of the one who does it". 
However, where the text "Karei Karentam va Saizzai" is present, one should understand the meaning as "gets it done by someone else or approves of the one who gets it done". 
In the currently available copies of the Nishisth Sutra, there is no atonement-indicating text with each sutra, but in ancient times, there would have been an atonement text with each sutra. The Churnikar often mentions atonement in the meaning and discussion of many sutras. 

Page #108:

## Nishīthসূত্র

**Example:** See the commentary of the second sūtra of the first uddeśaka, the first sūtra of the second uddeśaka, and the first sūtra of the third uddeśaka. In these sūtras, the explanation is given as "tass māsagurupacchittaṁ, tass māsalahupacchittaṁ", "tass māsalahuṁ", etc. However, the explanation of the available prāyaścitta text attached to the last sūtra of the uddeśaka is rarely given. The action-explanation of the prāyaścitta-indicating sentences like "tass māsalahu" etc. in the explanation of other sūtras is mostly the same in the last sūtras.

Therefore, the last sentence of each sūtra should be "karentaṁ vā sāijjai āvajjai se māsiyam parihāraṭṭhāṇaṁ aṇugghāiyaṁ". (He who approves of the one who does it, receives the guru-māsika prāyaścitta. This should be the case.)

Sometimes, when the original text was summarized, instead of writing the prāyaścitta text along with all the sūtras, the text "taṁ sevāmaṇe" was written more extensively to connect the relationship with the last sūtra of the uddeśaka. This is known from the word meaning and explanation given by the chūrṇikāra.

**Sāijjai:** To have an interest in the occurrence of any prohibited act is "sāijjaṇā". It is of two types:

1. **Getting someone else to do the prohibited act.**
2. **Approving of the one who does the prohibited act.**

Getting someone else to do it is also of two types:

1. **Getting it done by someone who desires to do the prohibited act.**
2. **Getting it done by someone who does not desire to do the prohibited act, by force.**

Approval is also of two types:

1. **Praising the one who does the prohibited act.**
2. **Not dissuading the one who does the wrong act by the head of the assembly.**

**Example:** Which has a greater fault, getting someone else to do a prohibited act or approving of the prohibited act? **Answer:** Approving has a lesser fault, and getting someone else to do it has a greater fault.

Discussion-Sutras 2 to 8 each have seven illustrations given by the commentator for clarification, they are as follows:
1. Illustration of the manipulation sutra - Just as a lion, when awakened from sleep, destroys the life of the one who awakened him, so too, the one who manipulates the quieted "angadāna" destroys his celibacy.
2. Illustration of the massage sutra - Just as a quiet snake, when any part of it is pressed by someone's foot, bites him, so too, the massage of the quieted "angadāna" destroys celibacy.

**[Nishith Sutra 3. Abhyangan Sutra's Illustration:** Just as fire becomes intensely blazing when it is sprinkled with ghee, similarly, the Kamagni (desire fire) becomes intensely ignited when the Angadan (genitals) are massaged with oil etc.

**4. Ubtan Sutra's Illustration:** Just as a spear becomes extremely deadly when its edge is sharpened, similarly, the Ubtan (scrub) of the Angadan is extremely deadly for Brahmacharya (celibacy).

**5. Utkshalan Sutra's Illustration:** Just as a lion, when suffering from pain in its eyes, is cleansed by a physician's application of medicine, and then eats the physician himself, similarly, the one who performs "Prakshalan" (cleansing) of the Angadan, his Brahmacharya is broken.

**6. Nishchalan Sutra's Illustration:** Just as anyone who opens the mouth of a sleeping python is eaten by it, similarly, the one who lifts the skin-covering of the Angadan, his Brahmacharya is disturbed.

**7. Jighran Sutra's Illustration:** A king, despite the physician's advice, kept smelling mangoes, and as a result, he died of Ambashti disease. Similarly, the one who "massages the Angadan and smells his hand," his Brahmacharya is destroyed by the Veda-Mohodey (the power of the Vedas).

**"Angadan"** is a word that indicates the genitals. In such contexts, the Agamkar (scriptural author) also uses obscure synonyms, some of which have fixed meanings. Commentators refer to them as "Saamyayiki Sanjna or Saiddhantic Prayog Vishesh" (contextual designation or specific theoretical usage). Nevertheless, these words also convey the relevant meaning. Some words are based on compound derivation, and they clearly refer to the same meaning.

The explanation of this word states that this bodily part is the cause of the production of other body parts. Therefore, it is called Angadan because it is the cause of its origin. The names of Ang (limb), Upang (appendage), and Angopang (sub-appendage) are as follows:

**1. Ang:** Head, Heart, Abdomen, Back, Two Arms, Two Urus (thighs).

**2. Upang:** Ears, Nose, Eyes, Jangh (lower leg), Hands, Feet etc.

**3. Angopang:** Nails, Hair, Moustache, Beard, Fingers, Hastatal (palm), Hastupatal (raised part of the palm).

**Abhangejj, Makkhejj, Nishith Sutra:** These three words are used in the sense of massage with oil etc. - "Abhangejj, Makkhejj, Bhilingejj", all three mean massage.

In a Sutra, where two of these three words are used, the first word indicates "once" and the second word indicates "many times".

The word "Makkhejj" when used with "Abhangejj" indicates "many times", and the same "Makkhejj" when used with "Bhilingejj" indicates "once".

[11 _ 'Uvv?jj परिवट्टज्ज'-kalk etc. substances are used in the sense of applying [applying, sticking, coating, grinding etc.] an ubtan. There are three words used for this - "Ullolaj, Uvvjj, परिव?ज्ज", their meaning is also similar to Abhangajj-Makkhaj.
Difference between massage and ubtan: The substances suitable for massage are oily. Special strength and effort is used in massaging with them. This kind of massage is beneficial from the skin to the bones.
Ubtan substances are rough and soft. They do not require special strength and effort to apply. Ubtan substances are generally beneficial for the skin.
Kakken: - Due to the difference in the field and time, there is a change in the use of substances. The words Kalk etc. are also similar. Their meaning is based on the powder:
1. Kakken, 2. Lodhen, 3. Paumchunnen, 4. Nhanen, 5. Sinanen, 6. Chunnehim, 7. Vanehim.
These seven words have been used in many places in the context of body rituals. The scribes have abbreviated the text by putting a dot in the context of such similar texts. Due to the lack of a uniform method of abbreviation, two, three, or four words have been left in some places. In the explanation of the further objectives, the Churnikar does not explain again by referring to the first objective. Therefore, the Agama-Swadhyayi should make a wise decision in such places.
9. Je Bhikkhu Angadaanam Anyaranshi Achittansi Soyansi Anuppavesetta Sukkapoggale Nigyaaei, Nigyaaetam Va Saizjji.
9. A monk who inserts "Angadaan" into any un-conscious hole and removes the Shukra-Pudgalas or approves of the one who removes them (receives Guru-Masik Pratikraman).
Discussion: Failure to follow even one of the 9 Vads of Brahmacharya and the intense rise of Vedamohaniya leads to such a state. Uttaraadhyayana A. 16 mentions ten places for the Samadhi of Brahmacharya Vrat. Utt. A. 32 and Dasha Vaikalik A. 8 also have teachings on this subject.
Some places are quoted here:
1. Vibhusa Itthisansaggo, Paniyam Pan-Bhoyanam.

2. Chitta Bhitti Na Nijjhae, Nari Va Sualankiyam.

[Nishīthasūtra 4. When the Dvaggī garment is worn, the Samaaru is not to be uttered. Even the Dvaggī, who is a Pagaambhoīna, does not become a Brahmayāri. 
- Utt. A. 32, Ga. 11 5. Rasa Pagaama should not be served, for Rasa is a Dittīkara for humans. Dittī and Kāma are like the fruit of a tree for birds.
- Uttara. A. 32, Ga. 10 Saṃkṣipta Sāra-Vibhūṣā, the sexual intercourse and the prepared Rasa food should be considered as poison for Brahmacharya. If the eyes fall on the picture of a woman or women, they should be removed immediately. The place of stay should be free from women etc., the bed and bedding should be minimal, and the monk should always eat a light meal, not a Kāma-bhojī. One should act without attachment and aversion to the objects of the senses, etc. By taking such precautions, the Vedamoha remains subdued like a disease that has been subdued by medicine, there is Samadhi in Brahmacharya, and the soul remains away from the places of atonement mentioned in the Sūtra.

The discussion of the nine Vaḍos and the ten Samadhi-sthānas should be known from other Āgamas.
The word 'Śrota' in 'Aciṭṭamsi Soyamsi' is used in the sense of 'Chidra'. However, it is also used in the sense of path, place, etc. in Pāgama.
Here, the meaning 'Sthāna' is more appropriate than the meaning 'Chidra'. There are two Sūtras on this subject in Vyavahārasūtra Uddesa 6, both of which use the word 'Aciṭṭamsi Soyamsi'. The only difference is that the Guru Chaumāsī atonement comes when there is a tendency towards sexual intercourse, and the Guru Māsika atonement comes when there is a tendency towards manual stimulation. The reason for this difference is that the tendency in Aciṭṭa Sthāna is manual stimulation, and the tendency in Aciṭṭa Chidra is sexual intercourse. Therefore, 'Aciṭṭamsi Soyamsi' should be understood as 'Aciṭṭa Sthāna' here.

Atonement for smelling a Saciṭṭa substance
10. Je Bhikkhu Saciṭṭa Paiṭṭiyaṃ Gandhaṃ Jighāi Jighantaṃ vā Sāijjai.
10. A monk who smells a fragrant Saciṭṭa substance or approves of someone who smells it (incurs Guru Māsika atonement).

Discussion - This Sūtra states the atonement for smelling fragrant Saciṭṭa flowers, etc., with desire. Prācā. Śr. 2, A. 15, in the contemplation of the fifth Mahāvrat, inspires to be free from attachment and aversion to the natural fragrance that comes. Ācā. Śru. 2. A. 1, U. 8, says that when a natural fragrance comes, one should think, "Aho! What a good fragrance is coming, do not become attached to smelling that fragrance."

When the practitioner is told to remain indifferent even to the naturally occurring fragrance, then smelling it intentionally is clearly a transgression, and its atonement is mentioned here. 

Page #113:
---------------------------
## First Objective]
[It should be understood that all sentient beings, such as green or dry plants, fruits, flowers, seeds, etc., are consumed from the thirteen sentient substances. The atonement for smelling all non-sentient substances, such as perfumes, etc., is mentioned in the second objective. The atonement for the construction of a path, etc., by a householder is as follows:
11. A monk who causes or approves of the construction of a path, a crossing, a support, or a vehicle by a non-Jain or a householder.
12. A monk who causes or approves of the construction of a drain by a non-Jain or a householder.
13. A monk who causes or approves of the construction of a sieve or its lid by a non-Jain or a householder.
14. A monk who causes or approves of the construction of a curtain, rope, or mosquito net by a non-Jain or a householder. (He incurs the Guru-Masik atonement.)
Discussion-1. Due to rain, etc., the path becomes difficult to walk on due to water or mud, and there is harm to living beings while walking. Therefore, for convenience, the path that is made by placing bricks, stones, etc., in the shelter or near it is called a path.
2. Crossing path- The path that is made like a bridge, slightly above the ground by placing stones, etc., is called a crossing path. In this way, water flows below and there is convenience for walking above.
3. Support- If there is a need for support on both sides of a bridge, etc., or if there is a need for support while climbing or descending somewhere, then the means of making a rope, pillar, etc., for this is called "support".

##  English Translation:

**14]**
**[Nishith Sutra]**
**4. Dagvinika:**  A passage constructed to drain water accumulated in various places due to rain or other causes is called "Dagvinika".
**5. Sikkag:**  To protect food from creatures like rats, mice, dogs, etc., it is sometimes necessary to use a lid or cover. This is called "Sikkag".
**6. Chilimilika:**  When a safe place for observing vows is not available, or when a safe place for eating is not available, or when there are too many creatures like flies, mosquitoes, etc., a curtain, a screen, or a mosquito net is made in one or up to five directions for protection. This is called "Chilimilika".

These four activities should not be performed by a Sadhu from a householder. If it is necessary to have them done by a householder in a special circumstance, then it is subject to atonement.

**Atonement for getting these activities done:**

**15.** A monk who gets the "Sui" (needle) sharpened by a non-Jain or a householder, or approves of such an act, incurs atonement.
**16.** A monk who gets the "Pippalagassa" (scissors) sharpened by a non-Jain or a householder, or approves of such an act, incurs atonement.
**17.** A monk who gets the "Haccheyanagassa" (nail cutter) sharpened by a non-Jain or a householder, or approves of such an act, incurs atonement.
**18.** A monk who gets the "Kannasohanagassa" (ear cleaner) sharpened by a non-Jain or a householder, or approves of such an act, incurs atonement.

**Explanation:**
**1. "Uttarakaranam"**:  The meaning of "Uttarakaranam" is to refine, to make suitable for use as needed, to improve.
**1.** To repair the point and hole of a needle.
**2.** To sharpen the edge of scissors. 

Page #115:
---------------------------
## First Objective]
3. To make the nail cutter suitable for cutting nails.
4. To make the ear cleaner soft to touch.
In this way, the four instruments are reciprocated.
2. The four instruments - The sadhu can keep with him the instruments useful for the body and restraint. The instruments that are always necessary for all sadhus are called "Shraudh instruments". It is mandatory to keep all such instruments with you at all times. For example - clothes, utensils, dustpan, face cloth etc. Clothes and utensils are useful for the body and face cloth and dustpan are useful for restraint.
Some instruments are kept due to special circumstances, they are called "Satellite instruments".
They are also of two types
1. Always used, 2. Sometimes used.
[15
1. Glasses, sticks etc. are often used always. Therefore, they can be kept with you at all times.
2. The statement of the above four instruments used occasionally is in the above sutras, the statement of other instruments (umbrella, leather etc.) is also in the Agamas according to the context. Among them, easily available instruments are brought in a returnable form, which are returned on the same day or after a few days after the work is done.
Although the sadhu is ordained to have very few possessions, yet according to the area and time or according to the changing physical conditions, when, where, what instruments are needed and at that time perhaps those instruments are not available there; with this intention, instruments for removing thorns or tooth cleaners etc. other instruments are also kept with them at present.
Similarly, the needle, scissors etc. mentioned in the sutras can also be kept due to the circumstances of time etc., it appears from these reciprocation sutras.
Nishithbhashya Ga. 1413-1416 and Brihatkalpbhashya Ga. 4096-4099 have mentioned many satellite instruments kept in exceptional circumstances, see those verses with meaning in Udde. 16 Su. 39. Those instruments include needle, scissors etc., leather - umbrella stick and also books etc. are mentioned.
These sutras of reciprocation are also related to the satellite instruments like needle etc. kept with you due to circumstances. Because a returnable instrument for one day is brought only after seeing and being useful. If there is a mistake, it can be returned and another one can be brought.
But it is unimaginable for any monk to imagine sharpening the tip or edge of a returnable needle, scissors etc. from a householder and becoming a recipient of the Guru-monthly atonement.

## Nishīthসূত্র 16:

**The tools that are always kept close at hand, when they become damaged with use, it becomes necessary to refine or repair them oneself or sometimes have them repaired by others. It is only at that time that there is a possibility of having a householder do it.**

Therefore, the area, time, etc., specified in the sūtra should be understood in relation to the needle, thread cutter, nail cutter, and ear cleaner that are kept close at hand.

In the present day, it is not customary to keep needles, thread cutters, and nail cutters. Because they are made of metal, it is considered inconceivable to keep them.

The needle, thread cutter, and nail cutter mentioned in these sūtras, and the skin-cutting tools mentioned in the Ācārāṅga Sūtra and Vyavahāra Sūtra, are all made of metal and are available everywhere. And in the Āgamas, there is no text that states that metal tools are inconceivable except for vessels.

The root of attachment is possessiveness. Possessiveness is usually greater for valuable things. Therefore, the restrained ones (śramaṇa) should not keep money (current coins), gold, silver, and things made from them. Such prohibitions are found in many places in the Āgamas. See Daśavaikalika Śra. 10, Gā. 6, "Grahaṇe ṇijjārūvarya" and Uttarādhyayana 35, Gā. 13, "Hiraṇṇaṁ jāyarūvaṁ ca maṇasā vi na patthae," etc. However, there is no prohibition whatsoever in any Āgama against keeping iron needles, scissors, nail cutters, ear cleaners, and skin-cutting tools, etc. Therefore, it does not seem appropriate to completely prohibit them.

In the Āgamas, only in the context of vessels, there is a prohibition against accepting vessels of many kinds other than the three types. In that, there is no mention of a prohibition only of metal, but there is a prohibition of many kinds, such as stone, glass, teeth, horn, leather, cloth, conch, etc., which is only appropriate to understand in relation to vessels. That rule cannot be applied to all tools. Otherwise, there would be a prohibition against many tools made of glass, teeth, etc., that are kept in the present day.

Therefore, sometimes, materials that are helpful in the pursuit of knowledge or in the pursuit of the title of śramaṇik (a Jain monk) can also be kept, even if they are made of metal (iron, etc.). This is clear from a consideration of these उत्तरकरण sūtras and other Āgama passages.

## अण्णउत्थिय गारत्थिय:

**A monk can do his own work or have it done by another disciple, etc. And if, for some reason, he is unable to do it in the absence of a male monk, he can also have it done by a nun. By doing so, he does not become liable for atonement. But if he has it done by a householder, he incurs atonement.**

In the present sūtra, the term "अण्णउत्थिय - गारत्थिय" is used for the householder. In the commentary, eight types of householders are mentioned. Here is an explanation of the order in which work should be done by those householders:

"Si gihatthāṇa kārāvaṇe imo kamo -

Pacchākaḍ, sābhiggha, nirābhiggha bhaddae vā asannī. Gihi aṇṇatittihie vā gihi puvvaṁ etere pacchā."

- Bhā. Gā. 629 and 1929. 

Page #117:
---------------------------
## First Objective ]
[17
**Churni** - "Pachchakaḍo = Old, read from him. In his absence, Saabhigraho = Anuvvayasampanno, Saavao. Then Nirabhiggho Dassanasaavao. Then Bhaddao = Asanni. These four are the divisions of Grihastha. In the same way, these four divisions are also for Annautthiye, starting with Pachchakaḍo. Each one has its own Asooya, Sooya, Bheya, and Kayavva. Earlier, Grihastha was in Asooya, then in Sooyavadi, then in Annatitthiye.
If you have to do your work through a Grihastha, then this is the order:
1. Do it through a Shraman Vesh Tyagi or an old experienced person,
2. If he is not available, then do it through an Anuvratdhari Shravak,
3. If he is not available, then do it through a Shraddhavan Shravak,
4. If he is not available, then do it through a Bhadra Parinami. These four are the Grihasthas of one's own sect.
In the same way, you should understand the four divisions and order for the Grihasthas of other sects (Annatitthik). That is, in the absence of the above four types of Grihasthas:
5. Do it through a Sannyasatyagi or an old experienced person,
6. If he is not available, then do it through someone who follows the vows of another sect,
7. If he is not available, then do it through a devotee of another sect,
8. If he is not available, then do it through someone with a simple nature.
Here, "Annautthiye" refers to the Grihasthas of other sects, and "Garatthiye" refers to the Grihasthas of one's own sect. This same method should be understood in all the subsequent objectives. However, in Objective 2 and 19, the use of these two words refers to different types of Bhikshachari and Mithyamata Bhavit Grihasthas respectively, not other Grihasthas. You should understand this explanation from there itself.
**Penance for asking without purpose**
19. The Bhikshu who asks for a needle without purpose, or approves of someone asking for it.
20. The Bhikshu who asks for a razor without purpose, or approves of someone asking for it.
21. The Bhikshu who asks for a nail cutter without purpose, or approves of someone asking for it.
22. The Bhikshu who asks for a dye without purpose, or approves of someone asking for it.

[18]
[Nishosuthra 22. A monk who asks for or approves of the asking for a Karna Shodhanak without a purpose. (He incurs Guru-masik Prayashchitta.)
Discussion: One should ask for a Sai etc. only after consulting with elders, if it is necessary for oneself or if someone else has asked for it.
_ Because there is a possibility of them being lost, broken, pricked, stuck, or forgotten to be returned, therefore they should not be taken without a purpose.  Pravidhi Yachana Prayashchitta
23. A monk who asks for or approves of the asking for a Sui without a purpose.
24. A monk who asks for or approves of the asking for a Pippalag without a purpose.
25. A monk who asks for or approves of the asking for a Nakkhedanak without a purpose.
26. A monk who asks for or approves of the asking for a Karna Shodhanak without a purpose. (He incurs Guru-masik Prayashchitta.)
Discussion: Every action of a Sadhu should be done with discretion and in accordance with the rules. Sui, Pippalag etc. are sharp, therefore discretion is necessary in taking them so that there is no bodily harm. Seeing them being taken without discretion, the householder may have doubts about the safety of his tools. This may reduce the desire to give.
Some specific types of Avidhis are mentioned in the following sutras. Anidishta Upayokaran Prayashchitta
27. A monk who, having received a Sui, sews a cloth with it, or approves of the sewing.
28. A monk who, having received a Pippalag, cuts a cloth with it, or approves of the cutting. 

Page #119:
---------------------------
## First Objective

**27.** A monk who asks for a needle suitable for returning, saying "I will sew clothes," and then sews a robe with it or approves of someone else sewing a robe with it.
**28.** A monk who asks for a cutter suitable for returning, saying "I will cut clothes," and then cuts a robe with it or approves of someone else cutting a robe with it.
**29.** A monk who asks for a nail cutter suitable for returning, saying "I will cut nails," and then uses it to cut nails or approves of someone else using it to cut nails.
**30.** A monk who asks for an ear cleaner suitable for returning, saying "I will clean my ears," and then uses it to clean teeth or nails or approves of someone else using it to clean teeth or nails. (He incurs the monthly penance for a guru.)

**Discussion:** The term "Padihariya" is used in the scriptures for an object suitable for returning. When receiving a needle, etc., suitable for returning, one should not specify a particular task. 
If a needle, etc., is received with a specific task in mind, it should not be used for any other purpose.
Using it for another purpose would violate the second and third great vows. If this is known, the householder will lose faith in the monk or the monastic community, will criticize them, and there is a possibility of not receiving necessary tools in the future.

**Mutual Giving Penance**

**31.** A monk who asks for a needle for his own use and then gives it to another monk or approves of someone else giving it to another monk.
**32.** A monk who asks for a toothpick for his own use and then gives it to another monk or approves of someone else giving it to another monk.
**33.** A monk who asks for a nail cutter for his own use and then gives it to another monk or approves of someone else giving it to another monk.
**34.** A monk who asks for an ear cleaner for his own use and then gives it to another monk or approves of someone else giving it to another monk.

**[Nishīth Sūtra 32. A monk who requests a *katarṇī* for himself and later gives it to another monk or approves of the giving.**

**33. A monk who requests a *nakhacchedaṇaka* for himself and later gives it to another monk or approves of the giving.**

**34. A monk who requests a *karṇaśodhana* for himself and later gives it to another monk or approves of the giving.** (He incurs the *gurumāsika* penance.)

**Discussion:** In the community of monks, different monks have different essential tasks. Therefore, when accepting needles, etc., one should be mindful of the language used. That is, one should not give instructions for a task or a person. If instructions are given, then one should behave accordingly. This should be understood in the same way as the discussion of the previous sūtras 26 to 30.

**Penance for the Return of Tools**

**35. A monk who returns a needle improperly or approves of its improper return.**

**36. A monk who returns a *katarṇī* improperly or approves of its improper return.**

**37. A monk who returns a *nakhacchedaṇaka* improperly or approves of its improper return.**

**38. A monk who returns a *karṇaśodhana* improperly or approves of its improper return.** (He incurs the *gurumāsika* penance.)

**Discussion:** The needle, etc., that has been requested for return should be given with discretion so that there is no damage to the tool or to one's own body or the body of another. That is, it should be returned by placing it on the ground, etc.

**Penance for Having a Vessel Cleaned**

**39. A monk who has a *tumba* vessel, a wooden vessel, or an earthen vessel made by a non-Jain or a householder, or has its mouth repaired, or has its unevenness smoothed, or instructs another monk to do so, knowing that he is capable of doing it himself, or approves of it being done.** 

Page #121:
---------------------------
## First Precept

**[21. Approving the one who causes or orders the polishing of the utensils (He incurs Guru-masik Prāyaścitta).]**

**Discussion:** A monk who knows how to polish utensils should do it himself, and if necessary, should also do the work of another monk. But he should not have it done by a householder, nor should he give permission to any monk to have it done by a householder.

**Explanation of terms:** "Parighattaveï, Nimmavaṇam, Santhavaṇam, Muhaadiṇam, Jamavaṇam, Visamaṇam, Samaikaraṇam"

1. **Parighattaveï-Nirmaṇam:** To make it fit for use.
2. **Santhaveï:** To fix the mouth, to make it suitable and strong.
3. **Jamaveï:** To make the uneven even.

**Example:**  Binding ropes etc. on the mouth of a wooden utensil is "Santhavaṇam". Applying oil, varnish, whitewash, etc. is "Parighattaṇam". Filling a hole, smoothing a rough surface is "Jamavaṇam". Similarly, the care of earthenware and bamboo utensils should also be understood.

**Significance:** The mention of three types of utensils in this sutra, instead of just the word "utensil", clearly indicates that it is permissible for a monk to possess three types of utensils. The same statement is found in the Ācārāṅga Sūtra, the Bṛhatkalpa Sūtra, and the Ṭhāṇāṅga Sūtra.

**Further details:** The description of the fruits of auspicious and inauspicious utensils, etc., should be seen in the commentary.

**Recommendation:** A monk should seek out utensils that do not require any kind of polishing.

**Prāyaścitta for polishing Danda, etc.**

**40. A monk who causes or orders the polishing, fixing, or smoothing of a Danda, a stick, an Avlehaṇikā, a bamboo needle, or any other object made of wood or metal, by a non-Jain or a householder, even if he is capable of doing it himself, knowing, remembering, or being able to do it himself, or approves of the one who causes or orders it (He incurs Guru-masik Prāyaścitta).**

**Discussion:**  The discussion of this sutra is similar to that of Sutra 39, but utensils are "auḍhika upadhi" for a monk, which all monks keep with them permanently.

**Explanation:** The tools mentioned in this sutra are "praupagrahika upadhi", meaning that a monk can keep them for as long as he needs them, with the permission of his Guru. These tools are not kept without a specific reason.

---------------------------
## First Objective

[23 Thegali are of two types - 1. Homogeneous, 2. Heterogeneous. Applying Thegali of the same type as the vessel is "Homogeneous", applying Thegali of a different type is "Heterogeneous". If it is necessary to apply Thegali to the vessel, then only Homogeneous Thegali should be applied, not Heterogeneous. This rule should be understood in relation to wood, gourd, clay, etc. But the cloth or thread used along with it is not called Homogeneous or Heterogeneous. And applying Thegali to connect with the solution is not called Thegali.

Avidhi-sutra 44-45 states the binding of the vessel, therefore the statement of Avidhi related to the vessel should have been after these sutras, but here in the 43rd sutra, this Vidhanasutra of Avidhi is related to these four sutras 41-42 and 44-45.

Its implication is that Thegali should not be applied by Pravidhi and binding should not be tied by Pravidhi.

Explanation of Vidhi and Avidhi

1. After binding and Thegali and after stitching etc., that place should become eligible for transcription.
2. Where binding, Thegali etc. have been applied, the portion of food etc. should be easily cleaned from there.
3. The work of applying binding etc. should be done in the least amount of time.

These should be understood as Vidhi or Vivek and the opposite should be understood as Pravidhi. Binding

The goal of the Sadhu should be to request only such a vessel which does not need to be repaired or bound etc. The meaning of these two sutras 41-42 and 44-45 is that "Whatever vessel is found should be such that it can be used directly without any rituals. If not, then according to the need, one inferior and three superior bindings can be applied."

_ Binding means - strengthening the roundness of the vessel by tying it with thread etc. so that it can remain safe for a longer time.

Applying binding at one place is called one binding and tying at three places is called three bindings.

If the clay vessel can work without binding, then there is no need to bind even at one place.

A very small wooden vessel does not need even one binding.

A large wooden vessel requires one binding. 1. In some copies, the following sutra is found more, which is not in Bhashyachurni    "Je Bhikkhu Payan Avihie Taddei Taddentan Wa Saijjae."

Page #124:
---------------------------
[24]
The *Nishith Sutra* *tumbi* vessel, depending on need, can be secured with two or three ties. The main goal of a *sadhu* should always be to avoid excessive carelessness and to increase *svadhyaya*.
The carelessness of a *sadhu* is to perform actions related to the body and *upadhi*, he is a renunciant of the *savadyayoga* form of carelessness.
*Aireg* binding - permission is given to bind when necessary, permission is also given to bind with three excellent bindings. A vessel with three bindings can be kept as long as it is in use. Generally, the need or utility of more than three bindings is less likely in any type of vessel. This is clear from *sutras* 44-45, however, *sutra* 46 gives limited permission in the sense of the possibility of a difficult situation. That is, if in a particular area or time, a wooden or *tuba* vessel, which already has one or three bindings, breaks, then until another vessel is found, it should be used with 4-5 bindings, but as soon as possible, a request should be made for an earthen vessel, etc., and the vessel with more bindings should be discarded. Keeping it after one and a half months incurs *prāyaścitta* from this (46th) *sutra*. *Vastra-sandhan-bandhan* *prāyaścitta*
47. The *bhikkhu* who gives or receives a single *padiya* garment, or who makes it, incurs *prāyaścitta*.
48. The *bhikkhu* who gives or receives more than three *padiya* garments, or who makes them, incurs *prāyaścitta*.
49. The *bhikkhu* who sews a garment without a needle, or who sews it, incurs *prāyaścitta*.
The *bhikkhu* who makes a single *faliy-gathi* on a garment, or who makes it, incurs *prāyaścitta*.
The *bhikkhu* who makes more than three *faliy-gathi* on a garment, or who makes them, incurs *prāyaścitta*.
52. The *bhikkhu* who ties a single *faliy* knot on a garment, or who ties it, incurs *prāyaścitta*.
53. The *bhikkhu* who ties more than three *faliy* knots on a garment, or who ties them, incurs *prāyaścitta*.
54. The *bhikkhu* who ties a garment without a needle, or who ties it, incurs *prāyaścitta*.
55. The *bhikkhu* who takes a garment with an unpermitted hand, or who takes it, incurs *prāyaścitta*.
56. The *bhikkhu* who holds a garment with an *aireg-gahiy* for more than a day or a month, or who holds it, incurs *prāyaścitta*.
1. The *churnikara* has not given any meaning to *sutras* 52-53-54, but the *bhashyakara* has given a verse that touches upon their subject.
*Tiṇhuvari faliyāṇam vattham, jo faliyampi sansivvē.*
*Pañcaṇham egtarē so pāvati prāṇamādīṇi* ||787||
Based on this verse, the text and meaning of the *sutras* have been interpreted.

47. A monk who attaches a patch to his robe or approves of someone who does so. 48. A monk who attaches more than three patches to his robe or approves of someone who does so.
49. A monk who sews his robe improperly or approves of someone who does so. 50. A monk who ties a knot in a torn robe or approves of someone who does so.
51. A monk who ties more than three knots in a torn robe or approves of someone who does so.
52. A monk who joins a torn robe with one stitch or approves of someone who does so.
53. A monk who joins torn robes with more than three stitches or approves of someone who does so.
54. A monk who joins a robe improperly or approves of someone who does so. 55. A monk who joins a cloth of one kind to a cloth of another kind or approves of someone who does so.
56. A monk who keeps a robe with extra joins, etc., for more than a month and a half or approves of someone who does so. (He incurs the Guru-masik penance.)

**Discussion:**
**Patch:** When a robe is damaged by a hole made by a rat, dog, etc., or by sparks of fire, and the remaining part is usable, it is necessary to attach a patch to the robe. Other such reasons should also be understood. The discussion regarding one patch and three patches should be understood as before.

**Improper Sewing:** It is necessary to sew when attaching a patch to a robe, but it should be done in a way that takes the least amount of time and is well-stitched. Many types of sewing are mentioned in the commentaries and Churnis, the meaning of which should be understood from the Guru.

**Tying a Knot:** If a robe is not worn out and has torn due to entanglement or pressure, then, in the absence of a needle, etc., to sew it, both edges of the robe are held and a knot is tied. Such knot tying is considered minor in one place and major in three places. If even after tying knots in three places, the robe is not usable, then a needle, etc., should be obtained and it should be sewn. But more than three knots should not be tied.

The word "improper" should be understood here as well from the above sutra 50, meaning that in tying a knot also, there should be no improper method, but rather a proper method should be followed. This also clarifies... 

Page #126:
---------------------------
##  [26]

**The Nishith Sutra states that it is not necessary to reopen any knot that has been tied according to the rules for the purpose of transcription, as it is well-written. Repeatedly opening and tying the knot is unnecessary carelessness.**

**Two sutras have been given for joining cloth pieces - Thegli and knot. These two (52-53) sutras are related to joining similar clothes. Therefore, here also the context of one stitch and three stitches arises.**

**Faliyan - Torn. It can have two meanings: 1. When accepting new, 2. When torn after taking.**

**When accepting new clothes, if they are less in width or small pieces of less length, then they have to be joined to make them suitable for a sheet etc., which has been instructed in Acharang Sutra Shru. 2 A. 5, U. 1.**

**One should try to take clothes that do not require any joining. Even if necessary, no more than three joins should be made, as many joins can sustain both the Sadhu and Sadhvi.**

**If a Sadhvi needs a sheet of four hands' width and gets a cloth of one hand's width, it can be completed with three joins. Even if pieces of less length than required are available, both the Sadhu and Sadhvi can be sustained with three joins.**

**The word 'Ganthiyan Karei' is used in the previous sutras 50, 51. It contains the atonement related to joining torn clothes by tying a knot.**

**The verb 'Ganthe' is used in sutras 52-53-54. It contains the atonement for joining different cloth pieces of the same kind by stitching.**

**The verb "Gahe" is used in Sutra 55. It contains the atonement for joining heterogeneous cloth pieces.**

**Thus, these sutras contain atonements for joining torn clothes or cloth pieces.**

**There is no atonement for joining similar cloth pieces and there is no atonement for stitching with thread like cloth, because it is the method.**

**There is atonement for joining dissimilar cloth pieces and atonement for stitching with a thread different from cloth, because it is not the method.**

**The atonement for joining by non-method and stitching by method is the same as Sutra 49.**

**Joining heterogeneous clothes - The word 'jati' used in this sutra can be taken as many kinds of clothes. For example - woolen, cotton, sanni, silk etc.**

**There are many kinds of woolen and cotton clothes. Woolen clothes - blankets etc. made from wool of sheep, goat, camel etc. Cotton clothes - muslin, lattha, reja etc. various types of clothes.** 

Page #127:
---------------------------
## First Objective]
[25

There are many types of clothes and threads, even due to color differences. Therefore, when a monk joins or sews pieces of cloth, he should be mindful that the joined pieces of cloth and the stitching thread do not appear different.

Regarding the excessive joining of clothes, the commentator Charnikar has connected "Aireg Gahiyan" to the "Gahei" (knotting) topic in the 52nd, 53rd, 54th, and 55th Sutras above, and also connected it to Sutras 50 and 51. He has stated that if monks and nuns keep clothes with excessive joining and knots for more than a month and a half, they are liable for atonement. Just as the atonement Sutras discuss the matter of keeping a vessel with excessive binding for more than a month and a half, the same meaning should be understood here.

If even one joining is done after the limit, after performing Sutraporisi and Arthaporisi, the other cloth should be examined. If two or three joinings are done, only Sutraporisi should be performed and the cloth examined. If more than three joinings are done, neither Sutra nor Arthaporisi should be performed, and the cloth should be examined first. The meaning of Sutra-Arthaporisi is 'porisi of self-study and meditation'.

Summary - The essence of the aforementioned 6 Sutras related to vessels and 10 Sutras related to clothes is that monks and nuns should avoid, as much as possible, activities like attaching a thegli (patch) to clothes, knotting, joining pieces of cloth, and attaching a tikdi (patch) or binding to vessels.

If it is necessary to perform the aforementioned activities related to clothes and vessels, they should not be performed more than three times.

If a situation arises where these activities are performed more than three times, instead of performing Sutraporusi and Arthaporusi, one should request a new cloth during that time. This should not violate the limit of one and a half months.

Home Smoke - Excursion - Atonement
57. Je Bhikkhu Gihadhum Annautthiyen Va Garathien Va Parisadavei, Parisadavetam Va Saizjzai.
57. A monk who removes home smoke from another non-Jain or a householder, or approves of the one who removes it, (receives Guru-masik atonement).

Discussion - This Sutra lays down the atonement for removing home smoke. The accumulated smoke from the stove on the wall of the kitchen or under the roof is called 'home smoke'.

If a monk, after obtaining permission from the owner of the kitchen to enter the kitchen, takes a tool that can reach the height of the roof and removes the smoke, he does not incur any atonement.

If a monk cannot remove the home smoke himself due to not getting permission to enter the kitchen or due to physical inability, and gets it removed by someone else, he incurs Guru-masik atonement.

[Nishith Sutra]

**Solution by Churnikar regarding the removal of house dust by a Sadhu:**

If a Sadhu develops skin diseases like eczema or itching, he should treat it with house dust. However, Churnikar has not specified the method of using "house dust". Therefore, one should learn the method of using house dust from a skilled physician or a skin specialist.

**Putikarma - Prāyaścitta**

**58. A monk who consumes or approves of food, clothing, or dwelling contaminated with Putikarma (impurity) incurs Guru-māsika Prāyaścitta (penance).**

**Explanation:**

The commentator has described three types of Putikarma: 1. Āhāra-Putikarma (food impurity), 2. Upadhi-Putikarma (clothing impurity), and 3. Śayyā-Putikarma (bed impurity).

**1. Āhāra-Putikarma:**

There are two types of food impurity:

* Food contaminated with impure substances.
* Food prepared using contaminated utensils.

Food prepared with pure ingredients but mixed with impure substances like hing (asafoetida), salt, etc., contaminated with Pradhākarmadi (impurities) becomes Putikarma-contaminated.

Pure food served with a spoon contaminated with Pradhākarmadi becomes Putikarma-contaminated.

**2. Upadhi-Putikarma:**

If a householder sews or attaches a thread contaminated with Pradhākarmadi to a pure garment, it becomes Putikarma-contaminated.

If a householder uses a contaminated stick or tie to attach a pure vessel, it becomes Putikarma-contaminated.

**3. Śayyā-Putikarma:**

If any part of a pure bed is made using bamboo or wood contaminated with Pradhākarmadi, the bed becomes Putikarma-contaminated.

Even if Putikarma-contaminated food is mixed with pure food, it becomes Putikarma-contaminated.

**Whoever consumes or approves of any of the Prāyaścitta-sthāna (penance places) mentioned in these 58 Sutras incurs Guru-māsika Prāyaścitta.**

[Nishīthasūtra
Vivēcana]

The first sūtra describes the creation of a foot-cloth with a wooden stick, the second sūtra describes its acceptance, the third sūtra describes its placement, the fourth sūtra describes the giving of permission to accept it, the fifth sūtra describes its distribution, the sixth sūtra describes its use, the seventh sūtra describes the keeping of a foot-cloth with a wooden stick for more than a month and a half if there is a special reason, and the eighth sūtra describes the atonement for removing the wooden stick and separating it from the foot-cloth.

In the commentary and chūṇī of the first sūtra, the word "rajoharan" is mentioned, which indicates the usefulness of the foot-cloth with a wooden stick. This creates confusion, as "rajoharan" is a medicinal term, which all ordained monks carry with them throughout their lives. Therefore, what kind of "foot-cloth with a wooden stick (rajoharan)" is there and what is its use? The solution to these questions is as follows:

1. A foot-cloth is a piece of old or torn cloth, one hand long and wide.
In Bṛha. Udde. 1, sūtra 40, the names of these four implements are mentioned: cloth, vessel, blanket, and foot-cloth.
Similarly, these four names are found together in many other Āgamas. This shows that the foot-cloth is as essential and useful an implement as cloth, vessel, and blanket.

Even though it is an auxiliary implement, the use of the foot-cloth was more prevalent in ancient times.
In Utt. A. 17, gāthā 7, it is mentioned that a Śramaṇa can sit on a foot-cloth after worshipping it with rajoharan. Here, it is called "pāyakambla," and the commentator has interpreted "pāyakambla" as "foot-cloth."

If a Śramaṇa experiences a strong urge for a long bowel movement at night or in the evening, and it is not possible for the sound of the recitation to reach the ground, then he should use a foot-cloth when defecating in a secluded part of the shelter. If he does not have his own foot-cloth at that time, he should take a foot-cloth from his fellow Śramaṇa and use it. This is the rule in Ācha. Śru. 2, A. 10. 

Page #133:
---------------------------
## Second Objective]
[33.
Thus, wiping off the unrighteous dust from the feet with a *padaponchhan*, cleaning the *padaponchhan* with a *rajoharan* and sitting on it, and using the *padaponchhan* during defecation, etc., are all prescribed in the scriptures. Therefore, *rajoharan* and *padaponchhan* are different tools because *rajoharan* is used for cleaning, while *padaponchhan* is used for wiping the feet, etc. Thus, both have different meanings and uses. 2. *Padaponchhan* with a wooden stick
If it is not possible to clean a place in the shelter with a *rajoharan*, and it is necessary to clean that place for some special reason, then a wooden stick is tied in the middle of the *padaponchhan* and used. This is clear from the *Brihatkalpa* U. 5.
From the observation of the commentary texts, it appears that the commentators have sometimes considered *rajoharan* and *padaponchhan* to be the same tool, but the five types of *rajoharan* mentioned in *Brihatkalpa* U. 2, Su. 30 and *Sthananga* A. 5, U. 3, show that *padaponchhan* and *padaponchhan* with a wooden stick are different tools.
Difference between *rajoharan* and *padaponchhan*
*Rajoharan* is not considered *pratiharic*, but the *Nishith Uddeshak* 5, Su. 15-18, prescribes penance for not returning the *pratiharic padaponchhan* at the appointed time, which proves that it is *pratiharic*.
A cloth is wrapped around the wooden stick of the *rajoharan*, but a cloth is not wrapped around the wooden stick of the *padaponchhan*.
*Padaponchhan* is used not only for wiping the feet but also during defecation, and sometimes one can even sit on it, but both these actions are not possible with *rajoharan*. On the other hand, sitting on *rajoharan*, sleeping on it, keeping it at the head, etc., are considered penance in *Nishith Uddeshak* 5.
*Nishith Uddeshak* 4, Sutra 30, prescribes penance for keeping *rajoharan*, etc., on the path of the *nigranthi*’s arrival, but there is no mention of *padaponchhan* there.
*Nigranthi* can keep *padaponchhan* with a wooden stick for a month and a half in case of unavoidable sinful situation, but a *nigranthi* cannot keep *padaponchhan* with a wooden stick even in unavoidable sinful situation according to her special *samachari*, but both have to keep *rajoharan* with a wooden stick.
Thus, the difference between *padaponchhan*, *padaponchhan* with a wooden stick, and *rajoharan* is clear.
In *Dasha* A. 4 and *Prashna* Shru. 2, A. 5, the tools of the *shramanas* are mentioned, and they have separate names for *rajoharan* and *padaponchhan*.

[Nishīthasūtra]
The commentator of the Praśravya-karaṇa has stated in his commentary on the above text that the number of instruments of the Śramaṇas, which is said to be fourteen, is only possible if Rajo-haraṇa and Pāda-pochan are considered as distinct.
In Ācārya Śruti 2, Adhyāya 10, it is stated that if a strong urge to defecate arises and one does not have their own Pāda-pochan, they should request it from a fellow Śramaṇa. However, there is no such option for Rajo-haraṇa, as even an Acela Jinakalpī Bhikṣu is required to have a Rajo-haraṇa.
These Āgama-pramaṇas prove that Rajo-haraṇa and Pāda-pochan are distinct instruments, therefore, they should not be considered as one.
Rajo-haraṇa is a medicinal instrument made from a group of pods. Pāda-pochan is a piece of cloth and is an auxiliary instrument.
Pāda-pochan with a wooden stick is a piece of cloth tied to a stick. In the seventh sūtra, the atonement for keeping a Pāda-pochan with a wooden stick for more than a month and a half is mentioned. The commentator, while explaining this topic, has stated that a new Pāda-pochan can be kept for a month, an old Pāda-pochan can be kept for two months, and a worn-out Pāda-pochan can be kept for a month and a half. After that, if necessary, one should request another Pāda-pochan or make a new one.
The reason for this is that: 1. Pāda-pochan with a wooden stick can be used for 2-4 days in some places or for a month and a half in an excellent area due to the nature of time. Later, in many parts of the house, the propagation of small creatures like spiders does not remain. Or
2. The cloth of the Pāda-pochan attached to the wooden stick becomes very dirty after a month and a half due to moisture, etc., and the birth of living beings takes place in it, or if the cloth is worn out, it becomes unpleasant to look at, therefore, it can be removed and another cloth can be attached. Therefore, the atonement for violating the limit of a month and a half is mentioned in the sūtra. Before a month and a half, it can be removed and changed whenever necessary. However, removing it without reason or removing it daily leads to an increase in negligence. Therefore, in the eighth sūtra, the atonement for removing and separating the cloth from the stick without reason is mentioned.
Pāda-pochan with a wooden stick should be tied in such a way that it can be easily cleaned. Just as a cloth becomes easy to clean by sewing it properly and tying it properly, similarly, Pāda-pochan tied properly with a wooden stick is also easy to clean. There is no need to remove it without reason.
In Bhāṣya Gā. 1413, Pāda-pochan is called an auxiliary instrument, therefore, it is appropriate to keep it and use it for as long as necessary in the area and time. When it is no longer needed, it should be discarded or given away.
In summary, a Bhikṣu can keep a well-cleaned Pāda-pochan with a wooden stick for a maximum of a month and a half if necessary. Even after that, if it becomes necessary to keep it, it should be removed and changed.

9. A monk who smells a fragrance that is not meant for him, or approves of someone who smells it, (incurs a minor monthly penance).

## Penance for Making Footpaths etc.

10. A monk who makes a footpath, a crossing, or a support himself, or approves of someone who does so.
11. A monk who makes a drain himself, or approves of someone who does so.
12. A monk who makes a sprinkler or a sprinkler cover himself, or approves of someone who does so.
13. A monk who makes a thread or rope swing himself, or approves of someone who does so, (incurs a minor monthly penance).

## Discussion:

Although the actions mentioned in these sutras are not suitable for a monk to perform, if they become necessary due to circumstances, it is better to have a householder do them. This incurs a greater penance than doing it oneself, because a monk can act more thoughtfully than a householder. Therefore, the penance for minor violation of non-violence is also considered minor. Having a householder do any work is considered misconduct for a monk, as per the tenth chapter of the Acharanga Sutra. This is why it incurs a greater penance.

The text mentions only two types of materials for making swings, but the commentator mentions five types. For further details, refer to the commentary.

It is clear from the Brihatkalpa Uddesaka 1, Sutra 18, and this Sutra from the Nisitha, that it is permissible for monks and nuns to keep or use swings when needed. However, if a pre-made swing is not available, making one oneself from thread or rope is a minor monthly penance, and having a householder make it is a major monthly penance. For further discussion, refer to the first objective, Sutras 11-14.

### Penance for Performing Uttarakaraṇa

14. A monk who performs the Uttarakaraṇa of a needle himself or approves of someone doing it.
15. A monk who performs the Uttarakaraṇa of a razor himself or approves of someone doing it.
16. A monk who performs the Uttarakaraṇa of nail clippers himself or approves of someone doing it.
17. A monk who performs the Uttarakaraṇa of ear cleaning himself or approves of someone doing it.

**Note:** The discussion of the above sūtras can be found in the sūtras 15-18 of the first Uddesaka.

### Penance for the Excess of the First Mahāvat

18. A monk who speaks harsh words or approves of someone speaking them.

**Discussion:** Harsh language uses harsh words. Monks and nuns who follow the language code should not use such harsh language because it is harmful.

If, due to circumstances, one becomes agitated, one should try to remain silent while following the code of speech.

Words of reproach, orders, instruction, and inspiration that are devoid of affection are all considered "mild harsh words" according to the Chūrṇikāra. This penance is for such harsh words.

**Example:**

1. A monk could not find his tool where he had left it. He asked the monk sitting there, "I left my tool here, where did it go?" The monk replied, "I don't know."

## Second Objective

[37. The Sadhu said, "Hey, careless one! What are you doing sleeping here? Tell the truth, who woke you up and where did they put you?" 2. Seeing another Sadhu sitting on his seat, a Sadhu said, "Hey! Who is sitting here? Get up from here, do you think this is your own seat?" 3. A sleeping Sadhu was woken up by another Sadhu for some reason, and he said, "Who is this wicked one who has disturbed my rest?" 4. A sick Sadhu said to another Sadhu, "How many times have I told you - you are not bringing me medicine." He said to the sick Sadhu, "Why are you crying out? Can't you be patient?" 5. A Ganapramukh asked some Sadhus to bring a rare object, many searched but their search was unsuccessful, only one's search was successful. One of the unsuccessful searchers asked, "Who got the rare object?" The one who got it said, "I got it. What did you get, your destiny is to wander, so keep wandering."

Using such language causes pain to others, therefore harsh speech is subtle violence. It leads to transgression in the first great vow. Even though it is harsh, it is not harsh. Keshi Kumar Shraman had said some harsh words to King Pradesh, and Rajimati had said some harsh words to Rahnemi, but those harsh words were not harsh. Because the harsh language they spoke was spoken for the benefit of those souls, therefore, in that situation, the harsh words spoken without any attachment are not worthy of atonement.

Similarly, the harsh words spoken by the Guru to teach the disciple are also not worthy of atonement.

The atonement for harsh words spoken out of anger, pride, jealousy or hatred is mentioned in the Sutra.

There is no atonement for harsh words spoken with affection and a pure heart. Atonement for transgression of the second great vow

19. Je Bhikkhu Lahusagan Musan Vayai, Vayantan Wa Saijjai.
19. A Bhikkhu who speaks a little falsehood or approves of the one who speaks it (incurs a minor monthly atonement).

Discussion - Words spoken without consideration or out of fear are considered to be words of minor falsehood.

##  [38]
[Nishīth Sūtra]
1. When asked about an action that has been done, to say in fear, "I did not do it." When asked about an action that has not been done, to say without thinking, "I did it." 2. When asked while sleeping, to say, "I am not sleeping."
3. To claim another's property as one's own in the dark. The prāyaścitta vidhāna for such mṛṣāvāda is in this sūtra. False words spoken out of deceit or to harm someone are not to be understood here. 

**Prāyaścitta for the transgression of the third Mahāvrat**
20. The bhikṣu who accepts a small amount of something not given, or approves of the one who accepts it, (receives a laghumāsika prāyaścitta).
**Discussion:** The bhikṣu should accept every object only after requesting it.
In Daśa. A. 6, it is said that "Even a blade of grass (tṛṇa) for cleaning teeth should not be taken without permission."
In Vyav. U. 7, it is said that "Even to sit on the path, permission should be taken."
In Āchā. Śru. 2, A. 15, it is said that "The bhikṣu should always be inclined to seek permission, otherwise, it is possible to accept something not given."
In Bhag. Ś. 16, U. 2, it is described that knowing the types of avagraha, Śakrendra gives permission to all the bhikṣutrās of the Tīrthankara's reign to wander in the Bharatakṣetra and to use ownerless objects and places.
Therefore, there is a news-based method of seeking permission for such objects and places. For which, "Śakrendra's permission" or "Aṇujāṇaha Jassuggaho" is uttered.
In Āchā. Śru. 2, Pr. 7, it is said that "Even the equipment of one's sambhogi sādhus should be accepted only after obtaining permission."
In Sūy. Śru 1, A. 3, Praśna. Śru. 2, A. 3, Utt. A. 19 and A. 25, and many other Āgama texts, there is a prohibition against accepting something not given.

**Prāyaścitta for the transgression of the fourth Mahāvrat**
21. The bhikṣu who, with a small amount of cold water or hot water, washes his hands, feet, ears, eyes, teeth, head, face, or who encourages or allows someone to do so, or approves of the one who encourages or allows it. 

Page #139:
---------------------------
## Second Objective]
21. A monk who washes his hands, feet, ears, eyes, teeth, nails, or mouth with cold or hot water, or approves of someone who washes or is being washed, (receives a minor monthly atonement.)
Discussion- In Sutras 18-19-20, the atonement for the faults related to the first, second, and third great vows are mentioned respectively. Further, in Sutras 22-23-24, the atonement for the faults related to the fifth great vow is mentioned. Therefore, in this Sutra, one should understand the atonement for the fault related to the fourth great vow, because bathing is called 'Kamaanga' and a defilement of celibacy, therefore, here the atonement for the tendency of bathing in the form of 'Des-Snan' is mentioned.
Washing hands up to the wrist after eating is not considered worthy of atonement here, and cleaning feet, etc., that are covered with dirt, feces, etc., is also considered permissible.
These are general reasons. Apart from this, tendencies of washing without a reason should be considered prohibited. Those tendencies are called 'Bakushi' tendencies, and their atonement should be understood from this Sutra.
Atonement for wearing whole leather
22. A monk who wears whole leather or approves of someone who wears it, (receives a minor monthly atonement.)
Discussion- The commentator has mentioned four types of 'Kasina'. They are not considered permissible for a monk. In the present Sutra, the atonement for 'Sakal-Kasina' is mentioned, which means whole, complete leather. The remaining three types are:
1. 'Pramaan Kasina'- shoes, etc.
2. 'Varna Kasina'- bright (beautiful colored) one of the five colors.
3. 'Bandhan Kasina'- leather equipment for tying or protecting half the foot, the whole foot, the shin, the knee, the fingers, etc.
The atonement for these three types of 'Kasina' leather is not the subject of this Sutra, i.e., their atonement is major monthly, etc. The present objective is of minor monthly atonement.
Nevertheless, the commentator has described the types of atonement for all the options in detail. Its complete scrutiny is very useful for those who give atonement. One should also learn from the commentary about which leather equipment can be used as auxiliary equipment in which exceptional circumstances.
Curious readers can understand more from the commentary. Here, only the useful part of the subject mentioned in the Sutra is mentioned for general curious readers.

**Penance for Wearing a *Krit-sna* Garment**

23. A monk who wears a *Krit-sna* garment or approves of someone wearing it (incurs a minor monthly penance).

**Discussion:**

The commentary on this sutra explains the meaning of the term "Krit-sna" in detail and describes various types of penance. It states:

"There are four types of *Krit-sna* garments: 1. *Dravya-Krit-sna*, 2. *Kshetra-Krit-sna*, 3. *Kala-Krit-sna*, 4. *Bhaava-Krit-sna*.

*Dravya-Krit-sna* - A garment made from the finest, softest threads.
*Kshetra-Krit-sna* - A garment that is rare and valuable in a particular region.
*Kala-Krit-sna* - A garment that is rare and valuable in a particular time period.
*Bhaava-Krit-sna* - A garment that is beautiful in color or very valuable.

Each of these has three sub-categories: inferior, medium, and superior. Thus, there are twelve types of garments.

The penance for an inferior *Bhaava-Krit-sna* and an inferior, medium *Dravya-Kshetra-Kala-Krit-sna* is as described in the sutras. The penance for a superior *Dravya-Kshetra-Kala-Bhaava-Krit-sna* is a minor four-month penance.

A garment worth less than eighteen rupees is considered an inferior *Bhaava-Krit-sna*. Therefore, it is permissible for monks and nuns to accept garments worth less than eighteen rupees.

[Nishita Sutra]

Garments worth between eighteen rupees and one lakh rupees are considered valuable. A valuable garment is one that is extremely beautiful in color and soft to the touch.

The commentary describes the faults incurred by accepting the four types of *Krit-sna* garments as follows:

"If these faults arise from the four types of *Krit-sna* garments, then the acceptance of non-*Krit-sna* garments is considered better.

A garment that is different, has a count, is made from a different material, is from a different region, is from a different time period, is coarse, is of a dull color, or is inferior in quality is considered non-*Krit-sna*."

Monks and nuns should only accept *Krit-sna* garments. A *Dravya-Krit-sna* garment is one that is free from flaws.

## Second Objective

**From the perspective of the field:**  clothes that are readily available everywhere.
**From the perspective of time:** clothes that are suitable for everyone to wear.
**From the perspective of feeling:** clothes that are inexpensive and without attractive colors.

**Penance for wearing the same clothes**
24. A monk who wears the same clothes or approves of someone wearing the same clothes (incurs a minor monthly penance).
[41]

**Discussion:** The previous sutra spoke about the penance for taking and keeping whole clothes. This sutra speaks about the penance for taking and keeping the same clothes.
Here, the meaning of "abhinna" is "unbroken". Taking and keeping unbroken clothes leads to the following faults:
1. Not properly copying the clothes according to the rules.
2. The clothes being too heavy.
3. The clothes being stolen, etc.
Therefore, monks and nuns should take the necessary clothes according to the previously mentioned evidence.

**Penance for making utensils**
25. A monk who makes a clay pot, a wooden pot, or a metal pot himself or approves of someone making them (incurs a minor monthly penance).

**Discussion:** See the first objective sutra 30 for the meaning of the words.
Monks and nuns should be engaged in their self-study, meditation, and all kinds of worship at the appropriate time. They should not engage in any kind of utensil making without a compelling reason, because making utensils is also a kind of negligence.
They should make utensils with discretion if absolutely necessary. If they make them without discretion, they will incur the penance mentioned in the sutra.

**Penance for making things like sticks, etc.**
26. A monk who makes a stick, a club, a scraper, or a bamboo needle himself or approves of someone making them (incurs a minor monthly penance). 

Page #142:
---------------------------
##  [42]
**Discussion:**  See the discussion of **Parighattan** etc. in **Uddeśa 1, Sūtra 40**.  **Other:**  **Gaveshita** - **Prāyaścitta** for accepting a vessel obtained through another.

27. A monk who accepts a vessel obtained through a **niyaga** (family member) or approves of one who accepts it.
28. A monk who accepts a vessel obtained through a **para** (another Śrāvaka etc.) or approves of one who accepts it.
29. A monk who accepts a vessel obtained through a **vara** (chief person - head of a village, city, etc., a famous person, or a Sarpanch with a title) or approves of one who accepts it.
30. A monk who accepts a vessel obtained through a **balavan** (powerful person - strong in body or authority) or approves of one who accepts it.
31. A monk who accepts a vessel obtained through a **lava** (obtained by stating the benefits of the donation) or approves of one who accepts it.

**Discussion:**
1. **Niyaga:**  By family members.
2. **Para:**  By other Śrāvakas etc.
3. **Vara:**  By a chief person - head of a village, city, etc., a famous person, or a Sarpanch with a title.
4. **Balavan:**  By someone powerful in body or authority.
5. **Lava:**  Obtained by stating the benefits of the donation.

**Sadhus and Sadhvis** should obtain vessels etc. by their own **gaveshana** (investigation).  There is a possibility of many faults arising from obtaining them through another's investigation.  Therefore, understand the donor's intention and investigate the vessel yourself with a **pradīnavṛtti** (attitude of humility).  Accepting a vessel obtained through another's investigation incurs the **prāyaścitta** mentioned in the sūtra.

For detailed information on faults and **prāyaścitta**, see **Niśīthacūrṇi**.

Second Uddeshak] Agrapinda Grahan Prayaschitta
32. The monk who regularly consumes the Agrapinda or approves of its consumption. (He incurs a Laghu-masik Prayaschitta.)
Discussion - In the Dashavaikalik A. 3, the misconduct called 'Niyagpinda' has been mentioned. The Prayaschitta for the same has been mentioned in this Sutra. The synonyms of Niyagpinda are: 1. Nitiya Aggrapinda, 2. Niya Aggrapinda, 3. Niyagg Pinda, 4. Niyaggpinda, 5. Niyagpinda.
According to the explanation, Niyagpinda is synonymous with 1. Nimantrapinda, 2. Nikayanapinda, 3. Nityagra pinda, 4. Nitya Aggrapinda. All these mean - 'Food given regularly with an invitation'.
"You should regularly come to my house every day to take alms." The householder who invites the monks in this way, incurs a Laghu-masik Prayaschitta if he takes food from his house. Even if the food is made for his personal use. This is the opinion of the Bhashya and the Churnikar.
The householder who regularly donates the best and delicious food every day, whether he invites or not, incurs the Laghu-masik Prayaschitta mentioned in the Sutra if he takes food from his house.
The Churnikar also interprets Agrapinda as Nitya Nimantrita pinda and explains its many alternatives and the faults arising from it, saying, "Therefore, the pinda should be avoided due to the invitation, etc. because of the fault of Nikayana pinda." The monks who are in the state of Gottya Panag, avoid taking food for a month, they take Niyaggpinda.
The commentator has also clarified that it is not a fault to take food from one house for two or four consecutive days in the absence of invitation and regularity, by avoiding all the faults of research. That is, it is not a misconduct called Niyagpinda. Danapinda Prayaschitta
33. The monk who regularly consumes the pinda or approves of its consumption. 34. The monk who regularly consumes the Avaddhabhag or approves of its consumption. 35. The monk who regularly consumes the Bhag or approves of its consumption. 36. The monk who regularly consumes the Uvaddhabhag or approves of its consumption.

##  [44]
[Nishith Sutra]
33. A monk who consumes or approves of the consumption of food prepared in Jain households where the entire meal is donated daily, incurs a minor monthly penance.
34. A monk who consumes or approves of the consumption of food prepared in Jain households where half of the meal is donated daily, incurs a minor monthly penance.
35. A monk who consumes or approves of the consumption of food prepared in Jain households where one-third of the meal is donated daily, incurs a minor monthly penance.
36. A monk who consumes or approves of the consumption of food prepared in Jain households where one-sixth of the meal is donated daily, incurs a minor monthly penance. (He incurs a minor monthly penance.)

**Discussion:** The meaning of these sutras is indicated by the commentary verse: "The entire meal, half of the meal, one-third, and so on, the portion that is donated, that is the portion that is considered excessive." [1009] Based on this verse, the meaning of the original text is given here.

If a monk or nun accepts a special meal that is offered daily with an invitation to specific individuals like priests, etc., they incur a minor monthly penance. This rule is stated in the 32nd sutra, and these four sutras mention accepting donations from households that donate daily.

If a monk or nun accepts a regular meal that is offered to ordinary people, they incur a minor monthly penance.

The Acharanga Sutra (Shru. 2, A. 1, U. 1) completely prohibits monks and nuns from going to households where a portion of the food is donated daily. These four penance sutras are related to that prohibition. The text of the Acharanga Sutra is as follows:

"Do not go to those households where they donate daily, where they donate the first portion daily, where they donate a portion daily, where they donate an excessive portion daily, or to those households that are constantly donating daily. Do not enter or exit those households for food or for any other reason."

Going to such households creates an obstacle to donations and incurs the fault of post-karma, because when the food is prepared again, there is initial violence.

The food donated daily from households that donate the entire meal is called "nitya-pinda." Monks and nuns who accept such nitya-pinda incur the minor monthly penance mentioned in the sutras.

The "nitya-pinda" mentioned in the Acharanga Sutra is different from the "niyaga-pinda anachaar" mentioned in the Dashavaikalika Sutra. The Acharanga Sutra and the Nishith Sutra refer to niyaga-pinda anachaar as "nitya agra-pinda." Commentators have explained that niyaga-pinda and nitya agra-pinda have the same meaning. In the current system, nitya-pinda is different from the fault of daily donation and niyaga-pinda anachaar. 

Page #145:

## Second Objective]
[45 Anācāra' is considered. Its meaning is also differentiated from the meaning of both, which has no ancient basis.
Regarding the interpretation of Niyagpiṇḍa, the commentators of Ācārāṅga, Daśavaikālika and Niśīthasūtra are of one opinion. Yathāniyaga-pratinīyatam jan nibandhakaraṇam, ṇ tu jan ahāsamavattīe diṇediṇe bhikṣāgahaṇam.
- Daś. A. 3 Cūrṇi [Agastyasiṃhasūri] "Niyagam" nityāmantṛitasya piṇḍasya grahaṇam na tu nityam anāmantṛitasya."
- Daś. A. 3 Ṭīkā-Haribhadrīya "Āmantṛitasya piṇḍasya grahaṇam." - Ācā. Śru. 2, A. 1 U. 1 Dīpikā
The prevalent belief about Nitya-piṇḍa is that "the Sadhu or Sadhvī who take food and water from a house today should not take food and water from that house the next day, nor should their Sambhogika Sadhu-Sadhvī." But the interpretation of the current Nitya-piṇḍa does not seem to be consistent with the descriptions of 'Samūha-vihāra' and the separate gocharī of each Saṅghāḍe mentioned in the Āgamas.
In ancient times, there used to be a group-vihāra of Śramaṇas with five hundred or a thousand Sadhus.
As mentioned in Rāyapasenī, the vihāra of Keśīkumāra Śramaṇa was "Pañcahi aṇagārasaēhi saddi samparivude" with five hundred aṇagāras.
In Jñātādharmkathā A. 5, the vihāra of Thāvacchāputra aṇagāra was "Sahassēṇam aṇagārēṇam saddi puvvāṇupudi caraamāṇe" with one thousand aṇagāras.
If there are even one hundred Saṅghāḍes with two Sadhus each who are taking food and water, it is not possible for everyone to remember from which householder's house which aṇagāra took food and water on which day.
It is possible for another Saṅghāḍe to take food and water from the same house the next day as the one from which a Saṅghāḍe took food and water on a particular day. In fact, it is even possible to take it on the same day, as mentioned in Antagaḍasūtra about Anīkasena etc.
In such a situation, according to the interpretation of the Ṭīkā of Daś. A. 3, Gāthā. 2, regarding Niyagpiṇḍa, and the Cūrṇi and Bhāṣya of Niśītha Udd. 2, regarding Nitya-agrapiṇḍa, "If a Sadhu takes food and water from the same house every day after receiving an invitation with respect, then it is Niyagpiṇḍa. And if they take food and water from the same house for several days without an invitation, then it is not Niyagpiṇḍa." This interpretation is appropriate and also consistent with the ancient group-vihāra, the separate gocharī of each Saṅghāḍe, and the practice of inviting others to take food.

[Nishith Sutra Nitya Niwas Prayashchitta
37. A monk who resides or approves of the residence of another monk in a place for a period of one month or four months, violating the prescribed limits, incurs a minor monthly penance.
Discussion - According to Praachana Shruti 2, Chapter 2, Verse 2, two actions are considered as faults in relation to the prescribed limits: 1. Kalaatikrant Kriya 2. Upasthana Kriya. Kalaatikrant Kriya
If a monk does not move from a place after staying there for one month (29 days) or does not move from a place after staying there for four months (from Ashadh Purnima to Kartik Purnima), then he incurs a fault called 'Kalaatikrant Kriya'. Upasthana Kriya
If a monk stays in a place for one month and then returns to the same place without spending two months elsewhere, or if he stays in a place for four months and then returns to the same place without spending eight months elsewhere, then he incurs a fault called 'Upasthana Kriya'.
The practice of both these actions is considered as 'Nitya Vas', and the minor monthly penance mentioned in the sutras is for this Nitya Vas.
The fundamental reason for prohibiting Nitya Vas and prescribing penance for it is that constant residence in one place without any reason leads to excessive familiarity, which can lead to either contempt or attachment, and the increase of attachment inevitably leads to a decline in character. Therefore, it is essential to spend twice the time elsewhere after one month or four months.
According to the Dashavaikalik Dvitiya Chulika Gatha 11, the calculation of the period for not returning to a place where one has stayed for four months is as follows:
After the four months of the four-month period, when eight months (twice the period) have passed, the four-month period comes again, making it a total of three times the period. It is essential to follow this prescribed limit.
The Agamas do not provide any exceptions for staying in a place after the prescribed period. However, the commentary verses 1021-1024 mention that Nitya Vas is considered faultless in situations like illness, etc., and for the growth of knowledge and other virtues, and such a monk is considered to be abiding by the teachings of the Jina and in restraint.
For a detailed explanation of Nitya Vas, refer to the commentary.
Pre-Post Sanstav Prayashchitta
38. A monk who praises the donor before or after receiving alms, or approves of someone who does so, incurs a minor monthly penance.
]
Page #147:
---------------------------
## Second Objective

[47. _ Pre-and Post-Praise Fault, is among the sixteen faults of production. The monks and nuns who commit this fault have to perform a minor penance. 
Pre-Praise is the fault of praising the donor before accepting alms. The intention behind this is that the monk thinks, "By praising him, he will give better and more delicious food."
Many monks and nuns, instead of praising the donor, praise themselves. They impress the donor by telling them about the miraculous glory of their caste, family, knowledge, meditation, or austerity, so that they continue to receive respectful and sufficient food and maintain a relationship. Post-Praise
Praising the donor after accepting alms is the fault of "Post-Praise." The intention behind this is that the monk thinks, "When I come for alms again, I will receive food with devotion." Thus, praising the donor for the sake of obtaining food is to corrupt the monk's selfless attitude, therefore, do not praise the donor in this way.
Explaining the nature, method, and fruits of a worthy donation for the growth of religious rituals, increasing religious awareness, and fostering devotion is not a fault but a virtue. It leads to the propagation and spread of religion. 
Pre-Alms Time Family-Home Entry Penance
39. _ "A monk who is residing permanently, or who is staying for a month, or who is traveling from village to village, or who has arrived in a city, or who has met his former acquaintances, or who has met his later acquaintances, enters the families before the alms time, or approves of those who enter, (he incurs a minor monthly penance)."
Explanation - If a permanent resident monk, a month-long resident monk, or a monk traveling from village to village has relatives or family members on his father's or mother's side, or on his father-in-law's side, in a particular area, then he should not go there for alms before the alms time. If he goes, he incurs a minor monthly penance.
Going there before the alms time and then again during the alms time increases the possibility of incurring faults like "intentional," "bought," etc.
Similarly, if there are householders in that area who are attached to the monks and nuns, then going there before the alms time and then again during the alms time increases the possibility of incurring the aforementioned faults.
If a monk goes to the aforementioned families before the alms time, he has the intention that "By going first, these people will prepare something special for me, and I will go again during the alms time..." 

Page #148:
---------------------------
[48]
The injunction of the prescribed atonement is based on the fact that "I will take sufficient food, etc., as per the Nishītha Sutra." This matter is prohibited in Prācā. Śru. 2, A. 1, U. 9.  The atonement for going on alms-round, etc., with other-than-Jain, etc., is as follows:
40. A monk who goes out or enters a village or town for obtaining alms with an other-than-Jain or a householder, or with a Parihārika or an Aparihārika, or who approves of such going out or entering, incurs a minor monthly atonement.
41. A monk who goes out or enters a vihāra-bhūmi or a viyāra-bhūmi with an other-than-Jain or a householder, or with a Parihārika or an Aparihārika, or who approves of such going out or entering, incurs a minor monthly atonement.
42. A monk who goes from village to village with an other-than-Jain or a householder, or with a Parihārika or an Aparihārika, or who approves of such going, incurs a minor monthly atonement.
Explanation: 1. Other-than-Jain - Ājīvika, Charaka, Parivrājaka, Śākya, etc. 2. Householder - A householder who earns his livelihood by begging, i.e., one who begs on certain days like Saturday, etc. 3. Parihārika - One who is fully aware of the faults of investigation and does not commit them. 4. Aparihārika - One who is aware of the faults of investigation but commits them due to negligence.
It is proper for a monk to be accompanied by another monk who is fully aware of all the faults of investigation during the alms-round. It is completely improper to be accompanied by any other person.
Keeping this in mind, a minor monthly atonement has been prescribed for going with an other-than-Jain, a householder who earns his livelihood by begging, and an Aparihārika of the same gender.
Going with an other-than-Jain, etc., also creates many doubts in the mind of the alms-giver. He thinks - Should I give alms to the Śramaṇa Nirgrantha first or to those who have come with him? What kind of food should I give to the Śramaṇa Nirgrantha and what kind of food should I give to them? Why has the Śramaṇa Nirgrantha come with an other-than-Jain, etc.?
The Śramaṇa Nirgrantha is great himself. If he had come alone, would I not have given him alms? Etc.

[49
Second Objective]
The meaning of these three sutras mentioned above is that a Shraman should not associate with an Anyatitthika, a householder, or an Apariharaka with the aim of social interaction or public opinion.
Being seen with them everywhere creates many doubts in the minds of observers.
Some people think - "The conduct of Nirgranth Shramans is different from the conduct of Anyatitthikas, etc., then why do they associate with them?"
Some people think - "These Shramans and these Anyatitthikas only appear different in their attire, their inner nature seems to be the same, therefore they always stay together."
Apariharakas are often prone to faults, therefore their Shraman conduct is not commendable in the general public, therefore associating with them also tarnishes the reputation of the Pariharaka Shraman.
For these reasons, associating with Anyatitthikas, etc. is considered worthy of a Laghu-Masik Pratikraman. The Pratikraman for drinking pleasant water and spitting out unpleasant water
43. Je Bhikkhu Annayaran Panagajayam Padigahitta Puff Puff Aiyai Kasayam Kasayam Parituvei, Pariventam Va Saizjai.
43. A monk who, having taken various types of prasooka water, drinks the good and spits out the bad, or approves of the one who spits it out. (He incurs Laghu-Masik Pratikraman.)
Discussion - Sadhus and Sadhvis use only the pure water obtained by avoiding all the faults of Eshana. Such water is called Achitt Eshaniya or Prasooka in the Agamas. In common language, it is also called Ghovan water, hot water, or Prasooka water.
Many types of such water are mentioned in Acharang, etc. When taking water in the homes of householders, the takers should obtain complete information about water with discretion.
Such as "Has this water been Achitt so far? That is, how long ago was it made?
How is this water made? That is, with the use of what substances is it made Achitt?
Who made this water for what purpose? Is it drinkable? Will drinking it quench my thirst?
Is this water suitable for my physical condition or not?" Such information is necessary with discretion.
Das. A5. U. 1, Ga. 81 states that if the water appears unfavorable upon seeing it, then take a little water in your cupped hands to test it and put it in your mouth and taste it. If it seems drinkable, then take more. If it is not drinkable, then do not take it. If such water is accidentally consumed, then it should be spit out.

##  Translation:

**[50]**

This Sutra contains these special words:

1. **Puppham**, 2. **Kasayam**.

Water whose color, smell, taste, and touch are pleasant is called **Puppham** here. Water whose color, smell, taste, and touch are unpleasant is called **Kasayam** here. Water that is **Puppham** - sweet - should be taken in a separate vessel, and water that is **Kasayam** should be taken in a separate vessel.

Different types of water should be brought in separate vessels and filtered.

First, the **Kasayam** water should be drunk, and then the good water.

If one drinks **Manojnya** water due to attachment to taste and rejects **Amanojnya** water, then **Laghumasik** atonement arises.

**[Nishith Sutra]**

Water that is produced from things like **Ker**, **Karela**, **Methi**, **Besan**, etc., is **Kasayam**.

Milk, etc., and sweet and fragrant substances, their water is **Manojnya**, and pure water and hot water are also **Manojnya**.

A healthy Sadhu should have no aversion to drinking various types of water. If one cannot drink **Kasayam** water, then there is no atonement for rejecting it.

**Atonement for eating **Manojnya** food and rejecting **Amanojnya** food**

**44. Je Bhikkhu Annyaram Bhoyanjayam Padigahitta Subimb Subhi Bhujai, Dubbhi Dubbhi Paritthavei, Paritthavetam Va Saizjai.**

**44. A monk who, having taken various types of food, eats the pleasant and rejects the unpleasant, or approves of the rejection, (incurs Laghumasik atonement).**

**Discussion:**

According to the previous Sutra, in this Sutra also, the word 'Subbhi Dubbhi' is used in the Pragamik style.

In the Churni, 'Subbhi' means 'Subham' and 'Dubbhi' means 'Abham'. In the Bhashya Gatha:

**Vanean Ya Gandhen Ya, Rasena Phasena Jam Tu Uvvetan.**
**Tam Bhoyanam Tu Subbhi, Tavivirayam Bhave Dubbhi.** || 1112 ||

Food that is pleasant in color, smell, taste, and touch should be understood as 'Subbhi', and food that is opposite in color, smell, taste, and touch should be understood as 'Dubbhi'.

1. **Puppham** - Good color, smell, taste - Pleasant - Subimb - Shubham - Bhaddagam - Manushnam.
2. **Kasayam** - Impure - Touch is opposite - Unpleasant - Strong - Dubimb - Bad smell - Ashubham - Description.

This is how the use of synonyms should be understood. The rest of the discussion is similar to Sutra 43. There is a possibility of many faults related to eating due to attachment to food.
There is no atonement for eating food that is mixed with poison, enchanted, or contaminated.
The commentary explains the meaning of both [43-44] Sutras with examples. Remaining eating - invitation atonement
45. If a monk takes delicious food, and it is known that there is too much, and it cannot be eaten, but it will have to be discarded, in such a situation, if there are any other fellow monks, companions, like-minded, or those who have not been expelled from the community, nearby, then he discards it without asking them or inviting them, or he approves of the discarding. (He incurs a minor monthly atonement.)
Discussion- 1. Delicious - Here delicious means sweet and palatable food.
2. Food - All kinds of food.
3. Leftover - Food left over after eating.
4. Nearby - In a nearby monastery or in a monastery in the suburbs.
5. Fellow monks - Those who have the same knowledge and conduct, or - those who have the same non-attachment, the same gender, and the same appearance.
6. Companions - Those who exchange food and water with each other.
7. Like-minded - Those who have the same conduct and have mutual affection and goodwill, or those who have pure conduct - monks who have been expelled from the community.
8. Those who have not been expelled from the community - Those who have not received atonement.
A monk who is skilled in begging, who is knowledgeable about time, and who knows the amount of food for himself and his fellow monks, is allowed to go begging.
Even if the food is delicious, sufficient, and given by a donor, he still eats according to the needs of himself and his fellow monks, and in accordance with a restrained life, he does not eat food, etc., out of greed, attachment, or lack of discernment, even then, if some food is left over after eating, the method of using that food is mentioned in this Sutra.
He should take the leftover food to a nearby monastery where there are fellow monks, companions, or like-minded monks, and tell them that this is our leftover food, please use it. If they do not take it, he should take it to a secluded place and discard it on the ground suitable for discarding. 

Page #152:
---------------------------
## Nishītha Sutra
[52] If someone gives a gift without showing the remaining offering to the monks present in the nearby monastery and without telling them about its use, then they incur a minor monthly atonement.

The Sutra uses three adjectives: sāmbhogika, etc., but sāmbhogika is the most prominent. Therefore, if there is a prasāmbhogika monk nearby, then giving food, etc., as a gift without inviting them does not incur the atonement mentioned in the Sutra.

## Shayyaatar Pind Atonement
[46-47] A monk who accepts a Shayyaatar Pind or approves of someone who accepts it, or a monk who consumes a Shayyaatar Pind or approves of someone who consumes it, incurs a minor monthly atonement.

**Discussion:** The Āgamas and the commentary texts emphasize the prohibition of Shayyaatar Pind due to the possibility of many faults. Here, to highlight this, atonement is prescribed in these two Sutras, and its form is described in a total of four Sutras (46-49). It is also mentioned in the fifth section of the Thānāṅgasūtra, in the collected sayings of the Guru Atonement section.

There are five synonyms for Shayyaadāta, due to differences in meaning or usage: 1. Sāgārik, 2. Shayyaakar, 3. Shayyaadāta, 4. Shayyaadhar, 5. Shayyaatar.

The word "Sāgārik" is used in the present Sutra. Other Āgamas also use the words Shayyaatar and Sāgārik.

The commentary elaborates on this topic by dividing it into nine doors, a brief introduction of which is as follows:

1. **Who is a Shayyaatar?**
"The Lord and those associated with the Lord are Shayyaatar." This is also stated in the Ācārāṅgasūtra: "Je tattha īsare je tattha samahiṭṭhāe" - one should stay with the permission of the owner of the house or the one who has authority over the house, i.e., the administrator.

The Bṛhatkalpasūtra, verse 2, states that there can be many owners and many administrators. One should consider the one who gives permission as Shayyaatar and not accept their belongings as Shayyaatar Pind. Offerings, etc., can be taken from other administrators or owners.

2. **Shayyaatar Pind is of 12 types:**
1. Asan (food), 2. Pān (betel leaf), 3. Khādy (edible), 4. Svādy (tasty), 5. Vastr (clothes), 6. Pātr (vessel), 7. Kamba (blanket), 8. Rajoharan (dustpan), 9. Sūī (needle), 10. Kataraṇī (scissors), 11. Nakhaccheda (nail cutter), 12. Karṇaśodhan (ear cleaner). Here, medicine and remedies are not considered separately.

It has gone. Therefore, by adding two more, there are 14 distinctions. In brief, these distinctions have two categories - 1. Food, 2. Upadhi.
By dividing food into 6 categories and Upadhi into eight categories, there are a total of fourteen distinctions, and from one perspective, there are 12 types. Then, medicine, ointment, bed, and other things are not considered as Shayatarapinda.
3. Grass, gravel, ash, Mallag (dried clay), bed, bedding, pillow, and vessel coating, etc. are not called Shayatarapinda.
From the description, other equipment should also be considered as Shayatarapinda, such as - glasses, pencils, pencil sharpeners, pens, etc., and books or furniture used for reading should not be considered as Shayatarapinda.
4. If a member of Shayatar comes to take the necessary Upadhi and food for taking initiation, then that disciple, even though being a member of the Shayatar family, can be accepted.
When is Shayatar? - After taking initiation, when food and equipment are kept in the shelter, it is called Shayatar, meaning that after that, its use cannot be taken. After leaving the Shayatar's house, when should it be considered Shayatar?
1. If one does not stay even for one night, but only for some time during the day, then after leaving the house, it is not considered Shayatar.
2. If one leaves the house after staying for one or many nights, then until the end of the day, one should not take food, etc. from there, considering it as Shayatar.
3. If the monks who eat together in one circle stay in many houses, then all their owners should be considered Shayatar.
If any monk brings his own food, then they should consider their own Shayatar and the Acharya's Shayatar as their own Shayatar.
4. Taking Shayatarapinda leads to the sin of disobeying the command of Tirthankara Bhagwan. In worldly practice, it is customary that guests who stay at someone's house eat there. If the Sadhu does the same, then the possibility of Udgam, etc. sins becomes strong. The Shayatar's spirit of giving may decrease. Because getting a bed is rare, doing so can make the rarity of the bed even greater.
5. In exceptional circumstances, it is necessary to observe the commentary to know the order of taking Shayatarapinda, etc.
Penance for not knowing the Shayatar's house
48. The monk who does not know the Sagar family, does not ask, does not inquire, and goes to the house of the Pindavaya-Padiya in the morning, and eats or does not eat, is considered to have committed a sin.

[Nishith Sutra
48. A monk who enters a house for gochari without knowing the house of the Shayatar, without asking or investigating, or approves of someone entering (incurs a minor monthly penance).
Discussion-1. Sagariyakulan-Shayatar's house.
2. Ajanai-General information, i.e., without knowing the name of the Shayatar and where his house is.
3. Apushchi-To inquire about specific information, i.e., to inquire about the Shayatar's glory, to know whether there is only one or many with the Shayatar's name, and to know the address of his house. Without such inquiry.
4. Agveshi-Without seeing the house directly, without seeing the Shayatar directly, without identifying him by age, caste, marks, etc.
In a familiar area, information about the name, lineage, and house can be obtained simply by asking, but in an unfamiliar area, it is necessary to see the person directly, observe his age, caste, appearance, and the surrounding area of the house, and keep it in memory. Only then can a monk go to take gochari.
Word meanings-Gahavaai-House owner, Gahavaai-Kulan-House of a householder with wife, children, etc., Pind-Food, etc.,
Pindvayapdiae-The wisdom of receiving the food given by the householder in the vessel. The penance for receiving food from the Shayatar.
A monk who, with the help of the Shayatar, asks for or begs for food, drink, edibles, or delicacies, or approves of someone asking for them (incurs a minor monthly penance).
Discussion-This section describes the penance for obtaining food with the help of the Shayatar. That is, taking the Shayatar along to show the house for gochari. In houses, saying "This cloth is cheap, this item is cheap," giving it yourself, or inspiring someone to give it at the request of a monk, etc., this is the penance for obtaining food through the brokerage of the Shayatar.
Sutras No. 45-46-47-48 are all related to the Shayatar. The commentary and commentary mention only three sutras. It seems that one sutra of "Ginhhai" has come into the original text due to a clerical error. It does not seem to be particularly necessary according to the subject matter.

The meaning of all three sutras is that one should not go to a place where a bed-maker resides without first obtaining permission from the owner of the place, nor should one accept food from the bed-maker or take food from his hand, nor should one offer food to the bed-maker. If the fourth sutra is accepted, then even acceptance becomes subject to atonement. Atonement for the lapse of time of the bed-maker
50. If a monk keeps a bed-maker who has been accepted for the remaining time, i.e., for the month, after Paryushana (Samvatsari), or approves of the one who keeps him.
51. If a monk keeps a bed-maker who has been accepted for the rainy season (Chaturmas) for more than ten days after the rainy season, or approves of the one who keeps him. (He incurs a minor monthly atonement.)
Discussion- If a monk has accepted a house or a mat, etc., in a particular area for a few days in the month of Ashadha, and due to some reason, he has to stay in the same area for the rainy season, then he should obtain permission again or return it to the owner. If he does not obtain permission again or return it even by Samvatsari, then he incurs a minor monthly atonement.
Similarly, if a bed-maker has been accepted for the rainy season, and due to some physical reason, he cannot leave the place after the rainy season, then he should obtain permission again or return the bed-maker within ten days.
In many places in different Agamas, the instruction of "minor upadhi" is found. Therefore, as far as possible, one should not accept mats, grass, etc., without extreme necessity related to the body or restraint, because bringing, giving, copying, cleaning, etc., lead to the loss of self-study.
If necessary, mats, grass, etc., can be accepted at any time during the remaining time or during the rainy season. There is no atonement for it, but the period for which they are accepted should not be violated, and permission should be obtained again before the time specified in the sutra.
In the Bhashya Churni, the necessary reasons for accepting mats, grass, etc., have been stated. Their summary is as follows.
The ground of the house is wet or damp, which may cause the upadhi to deteriorate and the body to become unhealthy.
There is a conflict with ants, termites, etc. 

Page #156:
---------------------------
## Nishīth Sūtra

If there is an abundance of Kanakhjūra (a type of insect), rats, scorpions, snakes, etc., one should definitely take Pāt-ghās (a type of grass) and other such things. Otherwise, there may be Jīva-virādhanā (killing of living beings), Samyama-virādhanā (violation of vows), and Ātma-virādhanā (violation of the self).

During Chaturmas, sleeping on wet or damp ground will make the Upadhi (body) more polluted. This will lead to Apkāya-virādhanā (violation of the body) when it rains during Gocharī (a period of travel) and other such occasions. Otherwise, if the Upadhi becomes too polluted, it will lead to the birth of living beings. Due to the pollution, the Upadhi will become cold and infested with lice, causing sleeplessness. Sleeplessness will lead to indigestion, and indigestion will lead to diseases. Therefore, one should definitely take Pāt, Ghās, etc., when the ground is wet or damp.

Here, the generation of lice is mentioned. The Āgamas state that a Sadhu (Jain monk) should endure "Jall Pariṣah" (wetness) and not bathe. The Pratikramāṇa (a daily ritual of repentance) also mentions "Chhappāi-saṅghaṭṭanāe" (a type of fault) in the section on sleeplessness. However, the above discussion suggests that during Chaturmas, there is a high possibility of lice generation due to rain and the lack of sunlight on clothes. Therefore, it is appropriate to keep the Upadhi clean and ensure that it does not become polluted. Hence, one should take the necessary bedding and other materials.

**Penance for not removing bedding that has become wet due to rain:**

52. **Je Bhikkhu Uubaddhiyam vā Vāsāvāsiyam vā Sejjasanthārayam Uvari Sijjāmāṇam Pehāe Na Osārei, Na Osāretāṁ vā Sāijjai.**

52. A Bhikkhu (Jain monk) who sees his bedding, which he has taken for the remaining period or for the rainy season, becoming wet due to rain, and does not remove it, or who approves of someone who does not remove it, (incurs a minor monthly penance).

**Discussion:** "Uvari Sijjāmāṇam" - becoming wet due to rain.

The meaning of this Sūtra is that if any Upadhi, which is returnable, such as bedding, etc., is becoming wet due to rain, etc., it is proper to remove it and keep it in a safe place. Not removing it is a cause for penance.

Although no one wants their own Upadhi to become wet, there is a greater possibility of negligence in removing returnable bedding, etc., when it is seen becoming wet. Therefore, it is mentioned in the Sūtra. However, one should understand from the implication that it applies to all types of Upadhi.

Although going out in the rain is a cause for violation, the penance for neglecting to remove wet bedding is mentioned because it can lead to many other faults.

Becoming wet can make the Upadhi unusable for some time, unfit for writing, swollen, and can lead to the generation of insects like Kuṭhuve, etc. It can also lead to Apkāya-virādhanā (violation of the body). If the owner of the item finds out, they may become angry and criticize. Such negligence can also make it difficult to obtain bedding, etc.

## [57
Second Uddeshak]  Penance for taking a bed-spread without permission elsewhere

53. A monk who takes a bed-spread, which is either *padihariyam* [brought from elsewhere] or *sagariyasantiyam* [taken from the place of residence], without permission, or approves of its being taken, incurs a minor monthly penance.

**Explanation:** The term "sagariyasantiyam" is used for the bed-spread that is in the place of residence of the monk, and the term "padihariyam" is used for the bed-spread that is brought from elsewhere. Both of these are returnable.

If the bed-spread, which has been taken from the house where the monk is staying, needs to be taken to another house for some reason, it is necessary to obtain permission from the owner again. The owner of the bed-spread brought from elsewhere also often gives it with the place of residence of the monk in mind, and the owner of the bed-spread also gives it with the expectation of using it in their own house. Therefore, it becomes necessary to obtain permission again.

Taking it elsewhere without permission incurs the fault of *adatta* [non-giving], and there is also the possibility of the owner being angry, criticizing, and the bed-spread being rare, etc. Therefore, it is said to be a minor monthly penance.

In the available original text, there are three sutras in place of this sutra, of which this is the third sutra. It appears that this was a single sutra during the time of the *Bhashya* and *Churnika*. It is as follows:

"No kappi nigganthaan va nigganthiin va padihariyam va sagariyasantiyam va sejjasantharam doccham pi oggaham ananunnavetaa bahiya-niharittae."

Even from this text, it seems appropriate to have only one sutra. Therefore, only one sutra is given in the original. The remaining two sutras are:

Je bhikku padihariyam sejjasantharam ananuvetaa bahim niinei, nonettam va saijjai. 53 ||

Je bhikku sagariyasantiyam sejjasantharam ananunnavetaa bahim niinei, nonettam va saijjai. 54 ||

If there are three sutras, the meaning is as follows: 1. The bed-spread is brought from elsewhere. 2. The bed-spread is taken from the same place. 3. The bed-spread is brought from elsewhere. If these are taken to another house without permission, then a minor monthly penance is incurred.

Penance for not returning bedding properly
54. A monk who takes bedding that is to be returned, and uses it without returning it, or approves of someone who does so.
55. A monk who takes bedding from a householder's house, and uses it without returning it in the same condition, or approves of someone who does so.
54. A monk who takes bedding that is to be returned [brought from someone else], and uses it without returning it, or approves of someone who does so.
55. A monk who takes bedding from a householder's house, and uses it without returning it in the same condition and without taking care of it, or approves of someone who does so. (He incurs a minor monthly penance.)
Discussion - It is the duty of a monk to return bedding [or any other item] that is to be returned to its owner before using it.
The bedding taken from a householder's house remains there. But if the monk, according to his need, separates the bamboo slats, etc., that are tied together, it is called 'vikaraṇa' (alteration), and not separating them is called 'avikaraṇa' (non-alteration). Therefore, one should use it only after returning it in the same condition and taking care of it. Otherwise, there is a possibility of many faults. This should be understood from the previous sutras [52-53].
Penance for not searching for lost bedding
56. A monk who does not search for lost bedding that is to be returned, or bedding from a householder's house, or approves of someone who does not search.
56. A monk who does not search for lost bedding that is to be returned, or bedding from a householder's house, or approves of someone who does not search. (He incurs a minor monthly penance.)
Discussion - If a monk knowingly or unknowingly takes either of these types of bedding, he should not neglect to inquire about them, search for them, and inform the owner. Neglecting to do so can lead to many faults, which should be understood from the previous sutras.
The rules regarding penance, as mentioned in these three sutras [54-55-56], are also mentioned in three sutras of the Brihatkalpasutra, Uddesaka 3. These are also explained separately in the Bhashya and Churni.
The Bhashya provides a detailed description of the types of bedding, the types of faults, the types of penance, and the methods of searching. Those who are curious can obtain detailed information from there.

[59 57. The monk who does not perform the *pratilekhana* of even a small *upadhi*, or approves of one who does not, receives the *laghu-masik* penance.
57. The monk who does not perform the *pratilekhana* of even a small *upadhi*, or approves of one who does not, receives the *laghu-masik* penance. (He receives the *laghu-masik* penance.)
Discussion- It is necessary for the *sadhu* to perform the *pratilekhana* of all his instruments at both times. If he neglects the *pratilekhana* of even a small instrument, he receives the *laghu-masik* penance.
The *chunikar* has said that there are many faults in not performing the *pratilekhana*, such as harming living beings and self-harm from scorpions, etc.
From these faults, one should avoid all of them.
According to the *bhashya* (verse 1436), the monk should perform the *pratilekhana* of all instruments at both times.
The *bhashyakar* has said that the time for *pratilekhana* for the *jinkalpi* is after sunrise, but the *sthavirakalpi* can perform the *pratilekhana* some time before sunrise.
In *gatha* 1425, it is said that the following ten types of *upadhis* can be performed before sunrise:
*Muhpotti*, *rajoharana*, three *chaddar*, two *nisadya*, *cholpatta*, *santhara*, and *uttarpatta*. When the *pratilekhana* of these ten is done, the sun rises.
In the *chuni*, it is said, "Others say" that the eleventh is 'danda'.
It is possible that this *gatha* was taken from a text like the *Dharmaprajnapti*, which was composed after the thirteenth century.
Because in the *Uttaradhyayanasutra* (study 26, verses 8 and 21), there is a clear provision for performing the *pratilekhana* at sunrise, and before the above *gatha* 1425, the *bhashyakar* himself has said in two *gatha*s that the *pratilekhana* cannot be done at night. Those *gatha*s are:
*Pratilekhana*, *papphodana*, and *pamajjan* are done during the day. *Papphodana* and *pamajjan* are done at night, but *pratilekhana* is not done. (1422)
*Pratilekhana*, *pamajjan*, and *payadiya* are done during the day.
*Pamajjan* is done at night, but *pratilekhana* is not done. (1423)
*Rao*, *papphodana*, and *pamajjan* are possible at night, but *pratilekhana* is not possible because it is not visible.

Page #160:
---------------------------
[60]
The Nishīyasūtra clearly states that transcription occurs only during the day, not at night. Therefore, the above commentary on verse 1425, which instructs on the transcription of 10 types of titles before sunrise, is questionable.
The Uttarādhyayana Sūtra, in its study 26, verse 23, explicitly instructs on the transcription of the Gochchaga after the transcription of the Muhpatti, while this 10 titles does not mention the Gochchaga, but places it with the transcription of the Patra after half a Paurashī. In this way, verse 1425 does not align with the original text of the Uttarādhyayana Sūtra.
The Uttarādhyayana, chapter 26 and commentary verse 1426, states that the transcription of the Patra should be done when the fourth part of the first Paurashī of the day remains, and the Patra should be transcribed and tied up at the beginning of the last Paurashī. After that, the transcription of the remaining instruments should be done and self-study should be done.
_ "Sā padhama-charmapouraśīsu kālo, tanvivariyo akālo paḍilehaṇāe." _ In this way, the first fourth Paurashī of the day is the time for transcription, and the remaining 6 Paurashīs [4 of the night and 2 of the day] are not the time. This explanation also proves that the time of the last Paurashī of the night before sunrise is not the time for transcription.
The Uttarādhyayana Sūtra, in its study 26, analyzes the faults and methods of transcription, and the commentary also mentions the separate atonement for each method. Interested readers should refer to the commentary.
_ "Tan sevamanāe āvajjai māsiyam parihāraththāṇam ugdhaiyam." _
Anyone who practices any of the atonement places mentioned in the above 57 sūtras will incur a minor monthly atonement. This should be understood in the same way as the first Uddesaka. The summary sūtra 1 of the second Uddesaka is to make a foot-wiper with a wooden stick. Sūtra 2-8 is to receive, keep, give permission to receive, distribute, use, keep for more than a month and a half, and separate the foot-wiper from the wooden stick. Sūtra 9 is to inform about inappropriate substances. Sūtra 10 is to make a path, etc., oneself. Sūtra 11-13 is to make a drain for water, a sneeze and a sneeze cover, and a flicker oneself. Sūtra 13-17 is to repair a needle, etc., oneself. Sūtra 18 is to speak harsh language. Sūtra 19 is to speak a little falsehood. Sūtra 20 is to take a little without giving. Sūtra 21 is to wash hands, feet, ears, eyes, teeth, nails, and mouth with inappropriate cold or hot water.

## Second Uddeshak [65]

8. A monk who, in Dharmasalas, gardens, houses of householders, or Ashrams, out of curiosity, begs for food, drink, edibles, or delicacies from non-Jain or householder women, or approves of someone who begs in this manner.
9. A monk who, in Dharmasalas, gardens, houses of householders, or Ashrams, when offered food, drink, edibles, or delicacies by non-Jain or householders, refuses, but then follows them, stays around them, and begs by speaking sweet words, or approves of someone who begs in this manner.

11. A monk who, in Dharmasalas, gardens, houses of householders, or Ashrams, when offered food, drink, edibles, or delicacies by non-Jain or householder women, refuses, but then follows them, stays around them, and begs by speaking sweet words, or approves of someone who begs in this manner.
12. A monk who, in Dharmasalas, gardens, houses of householders, or Ashrams, when offered food, drink, edibles, or delicacies by non-Jain or householder women, refuses, but then follows them, stays around them, and begs by speaking sweet words, or approves of someone who begs in this manner. (He incurs Laghu-Masik Prayashchitta).

**Discussion:** These twelve sutras encompass all places where Bhiksha (alms) can be received, as indicated by the mention of Dharmasalas and other places. Two types of Bhiksha-givers are mentioned: 'Anyatheethik' - householders of other faiths, and 'Grihasth' - householders of the same faith. The first four sutras describe the Prayashchitta for begging by specifically naming the food items.

The text on Bhiksha-dosha-nivritti (removal of faults in Bhiksha) also calls "begging repeatedly" as an excess. People think, "Why do they beg like beggars?"

Accepting the necessary and prescribed food items from what a householder willingly offers is "Adin Vritti" (humble conduct), while begging repeatedly is "Din Vritti" (beggarly conduct). Accepting Bhiksha through Din Vritti is a fault, hence the Prayashchitta mentioned in these sutras.

A Gीतार्थ साधु (a monk who has attained the stage of Gीतार्थ) can beg for food items by specifically naming them, with discretion, for a special reason. Here, the Prayashchitta is for begging without a reason.

This set of four sutras refers to both a single man or multiple men, and a single woman or multiple women. The second set of four sutras describes the Prayashchitta for begging out of curiosity. 

Page #166:
---------------------------
The **Nishith Sutra "Kautuk"** should be understood to encompass emotions like humor, curiosity, inquisitiveness, or the intention to test, etc. For example, "Let's see if this giver will give or not."  Seeking something with such a curious mind, even with a name-directed request, is considered unlawful in the practice of begging. Therefore, one should understand its atonement from this set of four sutras.

The **Dasha Vaikalik Sutra, Study 10, Verse 13** states:
"**Aniyane Akouhale Je Bhikkhu**" - A monk who is devoid of motivation-intention and curiosity is a true monk.

The essence of the aforementioned four sutras is that a virtuous person should beg with humility. The essence of these sutras is that one should beg without curiosity.

The **third set of four sutras** points to the fickleness and flattery of the mind along with the previously mentioned humility and curiosity. This can also be called an excess of curiosity.

In the places mentioned in the sutras, a monk entering a householder's home for alms refuses to accept something brought from another room in the house, or from an unseen place, or from a very distant place, saying, "I don't want it." This causes the giver to leave, but upon changing his mind, the monk again tells him, "Take it, so that your feelings and efforts are not wasted," etc. These sentiments are included in these four sutras.

Such unlawful begging also corrupts the language of the community. Thus, these 12 sutras speak of the atonement for:
1. Begging by asking,
2. Begging out of curiosity, and
3. Begging with excessive curiosity.

**Atonement for Forbidden Entry into a House**

**13. Je Bhikkhu Gahavaikulan Pindavaay-Padiyaaye Pavidhe Padiyaikkhaaye Samaane Dochchampi Tamev Kulan Anuppavisai, Anuppavisantan Va Saizjzai.**

A monk who, upon entering a householder's home for alms, enters the same house again after being refused by the householder, or approves of someone entering, (receives a minor monthly atonement).

**Discussion:** The previous sutra spoke of the atonement for begging for forbidden food again through a method. This sutra states that even if the householder says, "Go, go elsewhere, there is nothing here," etc., and the monk goes back to the same house after some time, or if the householder says, "Never come to our house," and the monk still goes there, this is the monk's lack of wisdom. This lack of wisdom is the atonement mentioned in this sutra. This lack of wisdom can lead to the giver becoming angry, suspicious, and behaving inappropriately.

## Second Objective]
[67 Short-lived Penance]
14. A monk who, seeing food prepared for a large gathering, accepts food, drink, edibles, or delicacies, or approves of someone who accepts them, incurs a minor monthly penance.
**Explanation:** "Sankaḍi-paloyana-" refers to seeing rice and other items prepared in a kitchen and saying, "Give me this or that." This is called "paloyana" with a Sankaḍi-view. A monk who accepts food, etc., in this manner incurs a minor monthly penance. (Churni, page 206)
"Sankaḍi-Jīmanavār" refers to a large gathering where food is prepared for hundreds of people from the very beginning. The Brihatkalpa Sutra, Uddesaka 1, and the Acharanga Sutra, 2.1.2-3, prohibit going to or in the direction of such a Jīmanavār for alms. The original text also mentions the disadvantages of doing so. Therefore, a penance is prescribed here.
The term "Sankaḍi-paloyana" is used in this sutra to explain the act of seeing various types of food prepared at a Jīmanavār and taking the desired items. Therefore, it should be understood that this sutra prescribes a penance for going to a Sankaḍi for alms and accepting food from there.
**Penance for Accepting Offered Food**
15. A monk who, entering a householder's family for alms, accepts food, drink, edibles, or delicacies offered from a distance of more than three rooms, or approves of someone who accepts them, incurs a minor monthly penance.
**Explanation:** Food, etc., should be accepted only in the room where it is offered or while standing outside it. However, the Dasavaikalika Sutra, Adhyayana 5, Uddesaka 1, states, "Knowing the extent of the family's land, one should stay within that limit." This means that a monk should only go as far as the permitted area in the family's compound. If, for some reason, it is not possible to go that far, and the householder brings the food from a distance of three rooms, then it can be accepted without incurring the faults of "eshana."
It should also be noted that while accepting food brought from a distance of three rooms is permitted, accepting food brought from a distance without seeing it ("adiṭṭha-haḍāe") is not permitted. 

Page #168:
---------------------------
## 6]
[Nishīthasūtra
A minor monthly atonement arises from accepting prasnadi (questions) brought from a place more than three houses (rooms) away.
The word "three" is used in many places in common parlance and in the Agamas. It is used to define the limit of a subject or to determine it. Here, the limit has been defined by the word "three". There is a possibility of fault in bringing an object from a distance beyond this limit.
Foot-related atonement
16. The monk who performs 'āmarjana' of his own feet once or repeatedly, or approves of the one who does so.
17. The monk who performs 'sanvāhana' - massage of his own feet, once or repeatedly, or approves of the one who does so.
18. The monk who massages his own feet with oil or ghee, once or repeatedly, or approves of the one who does so.
19. The monk who applies a paste or colors to his own feet, once or repeatedly, or approves of the one who does so.
20. The monk who washes his own feet with cold water or hot water, once or repeatedly, or approves of the one who does so.
21. The monk who colors his own feet (with lac, henna, etc.) or polishes that color (with oil, etc.), or approves of the one who does so. (He incurs a minor monthly atonement.) 

Page #169:
---------------------------
## Second Objective

**Discussion:** In these sutras, two words are given for the same action. Their meaning is interpreted as doing it once and doing it repeatedly. In the Churni and Bhashya, the meaning is given in a different way. For example:

1. **Thovena Abhanganam, Bahuna Makkhanam.** - Churni p. 27, Sutra 4.
2. **Abhangam Thovena, Bahuna Makkhanam.** - Churni p. 212, line 2.
3. **Etesi Padham Pada Sai Tu, Bitiya Tu Bahuso Bahuna Va.** - Ga. 1496.

**Aamjjan:** Rubbing hands on feet or rubbing with chariots.
**Sanbahan:** Massaging - pressing the feet with hands.

This atonement should be understood as performing Aamjjan and Sanbahan without fatigue or diseases like Vata. In special circumstances or lack of tolerance, the sthavirakalpi should be allowed to perform bodily functions and take medicine.

**Note:** Bhashya Ga. 1491-1492.
**Vyav. U. 5, Ni. U. 13:** While explaining the possibility of faults in the practice of bodily functions, the Bhashyakar says:

**Sanghattana Tu Vate, Suhame Ya'nne Viradhae Paane.**
**Baus Dos Vibhusa, Tamha Na Pamajjae Paae.** || 1493 ||

Gaatha 1498 also describes the faults. The combined meaning of both Gaathas is:

* Violation of Vayu Kay,
* Violation of small and large Sanpatim Jivas like mosquitoes and insects,
* Vakushta,
* Non-observance of Brahmacharya,
* Loss of Sutra-Artha (Swadhyay),
* Lokapavad (public criticism), etc.

Therefore, these practices should not be performed without a special reason.

**Fumejj Va Raejj Va:** The act of applying oil, etc. (to make the color brighter) with a cotton swab after applying henna, etc. is called "Fumejj" here, as in:

**Fumante Laggate Rago - Alattagarango Fumijjato Laggati.** - 1496.
**Meaning:** The color is applied by fumiting - the color of Alaktak is applied only by fumiting.

In the Sutra, the word "Fumejj" is given first, which is possible due to reasons like Vyatyaya, etc. Or, sometimes oil is applied and then colored substances are also applied, this statement can also be made in this expectation.

**Kay-Parikarma-Prayashchitta:**
22-27 **Je Bhikkhu Appano Kayam Aamjjejj Va Pamajjejj Va Aamjjantam Va Pamajjantam Va Saijjai Evam Paygamena Neyavvam Javam Je Bhikkhu Appano Kayam Fumejj Va Raejj Va Fumantan Va Rayantam Va Saijjai.**

## Nishīthসূত্র

**[Nishīthসূত্র]**

**[Verse 1]**

A monk who immerses his body once or repeatedly, or approves of someone doing so, is to be known as a transgressor, just like a transgressor of the rules regarding the feet. Similarly, a monk who colors his body or makes that color bright, or approves of someone doing so, (incurs a minor monthly penance).

**[Explanation]**

The independent statements of the transgressors of the six rules related to various limbs are mentioned here. Therefore, here, the statement about the body should be understood to include the remaining limbs - hands, stomach, back, etc., as six rules. The entire explanation should be understood here in accordance with the subject matter, just like the explanation of the rules regarding the feet.

**[Verse 2]**

A monk who immerses a wound on his body once or repeatedly, or approves of someone doing so, is to be known as a transgressor, just like a transgressor of the rules regarding the feet. Similarly, a monk who colors a wound on his body or makes it bright, or approves of someone doing so, (incurs a minor monthly penance).

**[Explanation]**

**Wound:** This is of two types:

1. **Naturally occurring on the body:**  Ringworm, itching, leprosy, etc.
2. **Caused by external actions:** Wounds caused by weapons, thorns, nails, etc., bites from snakes, dogs, etc., stumbling, or falling.

If a monk has the capacity to endure, then for the sake of karma-nirjara, he should bear the suffering arising in these situations with equanimity, but should not engage in any external actions.

Penance is prescribed for these external actions because there is a possibility of increasing negligence, increasing disease, etc., in many ways. This minor monthly penance is prescribed to remind the monk of the goal of "not engaging in external actions without an unbearable situation."

**[Verse 3 & 4]**

A monk who cuts or severs a boil, pimple, ulcer, abscess, or fistula on his body with a sharp surgical instrument, or approves of someone doing so, (incurs a minor monthly penance).

A monk who cuts or severs a boil, pimple, ulcer, abscess, or fistula on his body with a sharp surgical instrument, and then applies ointment or honey to it, or dries it, or approves of someone doing so, (incurs a minor monthly penance).

"The complete text of the previous sutra should be recited, and then these *alavaga* should be recited." Therefore, the complete text of the previous sutra is accepted here, and the meaning is summarized.
Here, the use of the word *annayaran* or *jatam* along with the *shashtra* *palevan* and *dhuv* is used. The meaning of this is that these are of many types, and any one type is intended here.
In many previous *palap*s, the *abhyangan* sutra came first, and then the *ubatan* sutra. But here, the *alapan* sutra comes first, and then the *abhyangan* sutra.

But the actions described in the previous *alavaga*s are non-sequential and independent, and the *alapan* and *ubatan* are different actions in both *palavaga*s, it should be understood.

From Sutra number 16 to 69, there are a total of 54 Sutras on the atonement for bodily actions. The commentator has explained the meaning of these Sutras as follows: "One should understand that there is permission to perform these actions due to a cause, and atonement for performing them without a cause." However, there are 6 Sutras for wounds and 6 Sutras for wounds etc. Why is atonement mentioned in these 12 Sutras even though the cause is clear?

In response to this question, the commentator says: "Knowing that the disease is caused by the unbearable, one should remain happy with a compassionate heart and endure it with equanimity, but one should not engage in contemplation or meditative state. The Jina-kalpi Grama-rananta remain in this state. However, when the pain becomes unbearable for the sthavira-kalpi, they perform these actions for the following reasons: 1. To avoid the severance of the meaning of the Sutra, 2. For the sake of a disciplined life, 3. To attain death with a meditative state, and 4. To increase knowledge, vision, character, and penance. This is called "performing with a cause."

1. Performing these actions without considering endurance etc., 2. Without aiming to increase capacity, 3. Performing these actions out of mere habit due to ordinary reasons is called "performing without a cause." This is the expectation behind this atonement rule.

Three verses indicating this meaning are as follows:

**Nikkāraṇe ṇ kappati, gaṇḍādīesu chēa-dhūvaṇādī | Āsajja kāraṇaṁ puṇa, so chēva gamo havayi tattha || 1507**

**Cupatitaṁ dukkhaṁ, abhibhūto veyaṇāe tivvāe | Addīṇo avvahiyo, taṁ dukkhaṁ ahiyaasae sammāṁ || 1508 ||**

**[73**

**Avvochchittiṇimittaṁ, jīvaṭṭhie samāhiheḍaṁ vā | Pamajjaṇādi tu pade, jayanaae samāyare bhikkhū || 1509 || Ni. Chū.**

In the Nisītha Sutra, objective 13 states that if one performs medical treatment without a disease [before or after a disease], then atonement is required. From its implications, it also emerges that the sthavira-kalpi, considering their meditative state, can perform actions of treatment and bodily actions, if necessary, with gradual discernment, based on the meaning of the Gīta and the meaning of the Gīta. The decision regarding exceptional circumstances is made in accordance with the principles of the Gīta.

---------------------------
[74]
It would be relevant here to quote some essential parts from the introduction of Nishīthachūrṇī Part-3 to understand the decision of Utsarga and Apavāda in Nishīthasūtra.
Utsarga and Apavāda
The goal of both Utsarga and Apavāda is the purification of life, spiritual development, protection of restraint, and the growth of virtues like knowledge, etc.
Just as a traveler walking on a royal path, when faced with a particular obstacle, abandons the highway and takes a nearby path, and after going some distance, if no obstacle is seen, returns to the highway. This is what should be understood in relation to going from Utsarga to Apavāda and from Apavāda to Utsarga. The goal of both is progress. Therefore, both are paths, not wrong paths or wrong paths. The harmony of both makes the sadhaka's sadhana successful and prosperous.
When and for how long Utsarga and Apavāda?
The question is actually important. Utsarga is the general method of sadhana. Therefore, the sadhaka has to walk on it continuously. Utsarga can be abandoned but not without reason. Utsarga is abandoned and Apavāda is adopted only in special circumstances, but not forever.
_ A sadhaka who abandons the path of Utsarga without reason or leaves it when a common reason arises is not a true sadhaka, he is not a worshiper of Jinājnā but a destroyer.
A person who takes medicine without reason or pretends to be sick even when he is not sick is a cheat, he is duty-bound. Such people themselves go astray and taint society. This is the condition of those sadhakas who abandon the path of Utsarga for ordinary reasons or who constantly use Apavāda without reason, who after using Apavāda once due to reason, continue to use Apavāda even after the reason is over. Such sadhakas themselves go astray and also present an inappropriate example in society. Such sadhakas have no principles and no limits to their Utsarga Apavāda. They defame the prescribed path of Apavāda to fulfill their desires or to hide their weakness.
The path of Apavāda is also a special path. It also leads the sadhaka towards liberation, not towards the world. Just as Utsarga is the path of restraint, so is Apavāda. But it should be truly Apavāda. The sadhaka needs to be constantly vigilant, aware and alert to ensure that the desire for enjoyment (and the kṣaya vrutti) does not deceive him in the guise of Apavāda.
If the sadhaka is faced with a truly difficult situation, no other easy path is found, and as a result, Apavāda has become unavoidable, then using Apavāda is Dharma. And as soon as the stormy atmosphere that has come is cleared, the situation is no longer difficult, then one should get on the path of Utsarga. In such a situation, even a moment's delay (restraint) can be fatal.

## The Second Objective

[75]

Another point is that one should consume exceptions only as much as necessary. It should not be that once one has done it, one thinks, "What's the harm in doing this too?"  Continuously rolling through life from one exception to another with a lax attitude is not an exception. For those who lack awareness of their limits, who do not know the quantity and boundaries of exceptions, exceptions do not lead to upliftment but to a hundredfold downfall. There is a very beautiful mythological illustration. From it, one can easily understand what the limits of renunciation and exceptions are and how one should analyze them with utmost honesty.

"A learned sage was passing by. He was extremely distressed by hunger and thirst. There was a terrible famine for twelve years. Some wrestlers of the king were sitting together eating. The sage asked for food. The reply was, "The food is leftover." The sage said, "So what if it's leftover, after all, I need to fill my stomach."  "In times of crisis, there are no limits." He took the food, ate it, and started to walk. Then he asked for water. The sage replied, "The water is leftover, I cannot drink it." The people said, "It seems that as soon as the food went into your stomach, your intelligence returned." The sage calmly said, "Brothers! Your thinking is right, but I have a limit. Food was not available elsewhere, and I was so distressed by hunger that my life was coming to an end, and I had no more capacity to endure. Therefore, I accepted leftover food in the situation of an exception. Now, water can be found pure elsewhere according to my limits. Therefore, why should I drink leftover water in vain?"

In short, the essence is that one should walk on the path of renunciation as long as one can. When it becomes completely impossible to walk, and there is no other way to escape, then one should resort to the path of exceptions. And as soon as the situation improves, one should immediately return to the path of renunciation.

The path of renunciation is the normal path. There is no room for the question of who walks on it and who does not. As long as there is strength, enthusiasm, no sense of dejection even in times of adversity, no harm to the Dharma or the Sangha, or no particular occasion for the loss of knowledge, vision, or character, one should walk on the path of renunciation, not on the path of exceptions.

One walks on the path of exceptions only occasionally. Not every seeker can walk on it at all times. The seeker who has fully studied the Acharanga Sutra and other codes of conduct, who understands the subtle essence of the Gītārttha, the Nīśītha Sutra, and other Chheda Sutras, who not only studies but also has a clear experience of the terms renunciation and exceptions, is the one who can make the right decision regarding the acceptance or rejection of exceptions. Therefore, in performing the practices mentioned in all the sutras dealing with exceptional rules, one should keep in mind the description of the nature of renunciation and exceptions.

**Worm-killing Penance**

40. The monk who, with his own hand, kills a worm, whether it is a small worm or a large worm, or who causes it to be killed, or who approves of its killing. 

Page #176:
---------------------------
## 76]
[Nishīthasūtra
A monk who removes the worms from his apānadvāra or kukshi with his finger, or approves of someone who does so, incurs a minor monthly atonement.
Discussion - Worms are generated in the stomach due to digestive disorders and often come out with impurities from the apānadvāra (anus). These worms sometimes stop at the mouth of the apānadvāra or sometimes inside. It is possible to cause harm by removing them with a finger, hence the atonement.
Kukshi - The inner part of the apānadvāra up to 3-4 inches. Pālu - The outer opening of the apānadvāra.
Kimiyam - Worms are of many types, small and large. They live for a short time after coming out. They can be like fine threads or like small snake babies.
Nakh-parikarma atonement
41. A monk who cuts or trims the tips of his overgrown nails, or approves of someone who does so, incurs a minor monthly atonement.
Discussion - In the Āgamas, "doharomanhansiṇo" - long hair and nails - Das. A. 6 Ga. 64 and "dhuttakesamansuromanhe" - one who does not perform the rites of hair, mustache, hair and nails - Praśna. Śru. 2, A. 1, Sū. 4, etc., even though there are such texts, one should not understand that cutting nails is absolutely prohibited because in Āchā. Śru. 2, A. 7, U. 1, there is a statement about not giving the nail cutter taken for oneself to another monk and the method of returning it to oneself.
In Nishīth U. 1, Sūtra 32, there is an atonement for using the nail cutter taken for cutting nails for other purposes. And in Sūtras 17, 21, 25, 29, 37, there are atonement provisions for taking it improperly, returning it properly, taking it without purpose, etc. From these Āchārāṅga and Nishīthasūtra texts, it is self-evident that a monk can take a nail cutter properly if necessary, cut his nails and return it properly.
But in the present sūtra, there is a statement of atonement for cutting nails, which makes it clear that there is a prohibition and atonement for cutting nails without reason, and there is no atonement for cutting nails with reason.
If overgrown nails are an obstacle in performing service tasks, then cutting nails is "with reason". Cutting nails with the intention of cutting them on a fixed day is "without reason".

## Second Objective:

**Hair Removal Penance**

42. A monk who cuts or trims the hair on his thighs, or approves of someone doing so.
43. A monk who cuts or trims the hair on his genitals, or approves of someone doing so.
44. A monk who cuts or trims the hair on his stomach, chest, or back, or approves of someone doing so.
45. A monk who cuts or trims the hair on his eyebrows, or approves of someone doing so.
46. A monk who cuts or trims his beard, or approves of someone doing so.
47. A monk who cuts or trims his mustache, or approves of someone doing so. (He incurs a minor monthly penance.)

**Teeth Care Penance**

48. A monk who files or polishes his teeth, or approves of someone doing so.
49. A monk who cleans his teeth with cold or hot water, or polishes them, or approves of someone doing so. 

Page #178:
---------------------------
[78]
[Nishīthasūtra 50. A monk who polishes or rubs his teeth, or approves of someone who polishes or rubs their teeth, incurs a minor monthly atonement.
48. A monk who washes his teeth with cold or hot water, once or repeatedly, or approves of someone who washes their teeth, incurs a minor monthly atonement.
49. A monk who colors his teeth with missi or other substances, or makes them shiny by applying oil or other substances, or approves of someone who does so, incurs a minor monthly atonement.
Discussion - In Dashavaikalika A. 3, Ga. 3, tooth brushing is called an act of misconduct. In Uvvai and other Agamas, "adanta-dhavan" (not brushing teeth) is mentioned as a practice in the life of a Shraman. In the present age, due to the difference in the food and water consumed by monks and nuns compared to ancient times, there is a possibility of tooth decay or "pyorrhea" if they do not brush their teeth. Therefore, those monks and nuns who wish to follow this Jina-injunction should take the following precautions:
1. Do not consume nutritious foods, and if they do, they should observe fasts or other austerities.
2. Always practice the Unodari tapa (austerity of eating only once a day).
3. Do not consume extremely hot or extremely cold substances.
4. After eating or drinking something, one should drink some water while cleaning their teeth. Similarly, when abandoning the four viharas in the evening, one should drink water while thoroughly cleaning their teeth.
5. Do not eat chocolates, pills, etc.
By taking these precautions, even while following the "adanta-dhavan" rule, teeth can remain healthy, and there can be a state of samadhi (concentration) in sensory restraint, celibacy, etc.
The Agamic injunctions regarding adanta-dhavan, bathing, celibacy, Unodari tapa, and other external and internal austerities, and all other rules are interconnected. Therefore, only by fully following all the Agamic rules can health and the samadhi of restraint be maintained.
The implication is that success in sensory restraint can be achieved only with the observance of the adanta-dhavan rule and with discretion in eating and drinking. Success in sensory restraint is the success of restraint worship. For these reasons, the Agamas give so much importance to adanta-dhavan.
Generally, using toothpaste and performing tooth-brushing related activities are all unsuitable practices for a life of restraint. However, if teeth become diseased due to carelessness or any other reason, using toothpaste and performing tooth-brushing related activities for medical treatment is not an act of misconduct. And it does not incur atonement from the present sutra.
]
Page #179:
---------------------------
## Second Objective]
[79
After knowing the disease of teeth, one should be free from tooth brushing which is done for the purpose of treatment by taking appropriate precautions, i.e. one should accept the practice of *adantdhavan* by being mindful of food and not accepting tooth brushing forever.
It should be understood that the present sutras speak of the atonement for brushing without reason, or for brushing, or for applying any other substance.
The atonement of *laghu chaumasi* for brushing etc. with the intention of adornment is mentioned in the fifteenth objective. *Prostha-parikarma-prayaschitta*
51-56. The monk who performs *pamarjan* of his lips once or repeatedly, or approves of the one who does so, should know that it is like the *payagame* (foot-washer), just as the monk who applies color to his lips or makes them shiny, or approves of the one who does so. (He incurs *laghu-masik* atonement.)
Discussion-Like the sutras of the feet, here also one should know the discussion according to the subject matter. *Chakshu-parikarma-prayaschitta*
57. The monk who cuts or trims his *akshipatra* (eyelashes) or approves of the one who does so.
58-63. The monk who performs *amarjan* of his eyes once or repeatedly, or approves of the one who does so, should know that it is like the *payagame*, just as the monk who colors his eyes or makes them shiny, or approves of the one who does so (he incurs *laghu-masik* atonement.)
Discussion-Like the 6 sutras of the feet, one should understand the discussion of the 6 sutras of the eyes according to the subject matter. That is, there are actions of rubbing, cleaning, and massaging etc. in the case of the feet, and these actions related to the eyes and lips. 

Page #180:
---------------------------
## 8.]

One should understand the nuances in performing the Nishīthasūtra, and in the context of 'Phumejj Raezz', the difference between applying henna and applying collyrium, etc.

**Rom-Keśa-Parikarmaprayaschitta**

64. The monk who cuts or trims the hairs of his nose, or approves of someone who does so.
65. The monk who cuts or trims the hairs of his overgrown eyebrows, or approves of someone who does so.
66. The monk who cuts or trims the hairs of his overgrown head, or approves of someone who does so. (He receives a minor monthly atonement.)

**Discussion:**

The sequence of 25 sūtras from 16 to 40, along with the original text, commentary, and Chūrṇī, is clear. 6+6+6+6+1 = 25 sūtras. The Chūrṇikāra has also indicated the number of 26 sūtras from 41 to 66, and the subject matter of the first and last sūtras. He has instructed to combine the meaning of the remaining 24 sūtras. In doing so, the original text of these 26 sūtras has not been preserved. This is evident because due to the poetic composition in the Niyuktigāthā, the words and order of all the sūtras could not be retained. The Chūrṇikāra himself calls the sūtra related to the hairs of the head the last one, and he also explains it in the Niyuktigāthā by placing it in the middle.

In total, including the Chūrṇī and Niyuktigāthā, there is only an explanation of 18 sūtras instead of 26. There is no clear indication of one sūtra related to the armpit, six sūtras related to the lips, and one sūtra related to the eyelid in that explanation. The available texts of the 18 sūtras that have been explained are also different. For example, a sūtra related to "Pās" is found instead of "Nāsā". It is neither necessary nor explained. The explanation of Romrāji is given, but there is no sūtra for it. Instead, the statement about the hairs of the eye has been repeated from the "Akṣipatra" sūtra.

The situations have been carefully observed. Based on the instruction of 26 sūtras and 13 verses in Chī. Gā. 1518, and matching the order from the bottom to the top of the body (as in Āchā. Śru. 1, A. 1, U. 2), the sūtras have been arranged in their order and meaning, taking into account the Chūrṇī-Niyuktigāthā, the original text, the initial and final sūtras, and the number 26 and 13.

No desired sequence of 13 words or 26 Sutras is formed by adding or subtracting any other Sutra or by disrupting the sequence, while the above sequence is unopposed.
Hair-king-Tirthankara, Yugalik etc. are described in the body description after the Guhya Pradesh. Here also, there is an explanation of Hair-king in the Bhashya Churni and the text "Romaim" is also available in other copies. Therefore, the Sutra with the word "Romaraim" has been kept, but keeping the Sutra of "Chakshurrom" creates opposition in the number 13 and 26, as well as in the explanation and meaning. There is also repetition, so that Sutra has not been kept.
Nose-hair-near-Hair-king includes the hair of the stomach and back, so the Sutra related to "near-hair" is unnecessary. In fact, "near-hair" does not have a separate existence in the body. And by doing "near", the "nose"-related Sutra is reduced. In the original text of the published Churni, there is no 'nose', while the Churni of this "nose hair" exists and the nose hair has a separate existence in the body and also has a tendency to cut.
The original text of the eight Sutras related to the lip, armpit and eyelid is generally available in all copies, and since it is consistent with the 13 words-26 Sutras specified by the Churni, and since the sequence is according to the structure of the body, it is necessary to accept these eight Sutras in the original text without explaining them, so they have been placed in the sequence-obtained place.
The description of "cause-non-cause" and the expectation of doing the tendencies mentioned in these Sutras without cause is itself a statement of atonement, etc., should be understood from the discussion of Sutra 34 of this objective.

## 82]
**Sweat Removal - Penance**

57. A monk who removes or purifies the sweat, accumulated dirt, wet dirt, or dust from his body, or approves of someone doing so, incurs a minor monthly penance.

**Explanation**

* **Seyam wa:** "Seyo - Prasveda:" -  Slight dry dirt.
* **Jallum wa:** "Thingalam jallo bhanati." -  Accumulated dirt - a lot of dirt.
* **Pankam wa:** "Es ev prasveda ullito panko bhanati." - This (above mentioned) dry dirt, when wet by sweat, etc., is called "pank."
* **Or:** "Anno wa jo kaddemo laggo." - Or, any other mud, etc., that sticks to it, is also called "pank." Here, the first meaning is relevant.
* **Malum wa:** "Malo pun uttarmano achcho, renu wa." -  That which naturally falls off due to touch, etc., and falls off and stays with it. Or, dust, etc., that sticks to it.  (See Churni, page 221)
* **Niharan:** Removing, taking away, or eliminating something small or large.
* **Vishudhan:** "Ase savishudhanam." - To make it completely pure.

This sutra's penance provision indicates that a healthy or capable practitioner should patiently and carefully endure the dirt of the body with a detached attitude.

A practitioner with limited capacity should also have the intention to endure the dirt according to their ability and should not engage in unnecessary actions. The penance mentioned in the sutra is incurred only when such actions are performed without reason. The determination of "unnecessary" or "necessary" depends on the individual's tolerance level. Or, it depends on their state of meditation or meditative state.

**Eye, Ear, Tooth, and Nail Removal - Penance**

68. A monk who removes or purifies the dirt from his eyes, ears, teeth, or nails, or approves of someone doing so, incurs a minor monthly penance.

**Explanation**

The meaning of the words is clear. The rest of the explanation should be understood in the same way as sutra 67. This penance is incurred when these actions are performed without reason. 

Page #183:
---------------------------
## Second Objective

[83] Removing eye dirt due to minor eye disease is considered 'sakaran' and is not subject to atonement.
Removing food particles and dirt from teeth due to minor dental issues should also be considered 'sakaran'.
Removing impurities and food particles from nails is not subject to atonement. However, removing nail dirt for purposes related to the needs of the elderly, the sick, or for collective service is considered 'sakaran'.
_ Those who are 'atmalabdhi' (self-realized) in their diet, or who follow a solitary diet, or who are 'gachchvasi' (members of a monastic order) with a strong inclination towards Dharma, like the 'anagar' or 'arjunamali' sadhakas, or who are 'gachchnirgat' (have left the monastic order), or who are 'gachchgat' (still within the monastic order) but have completely withdrawn from service-related activities, or who are similar in their inclinations and are supportive sadhakas, do not need to remove nail dirt except for removing impurities and food particles._
_ The tendency to scratch and itch can be reduced by leading a self-reliant and service-oriented life, which also reduces the likelihood of dirt accumulating under the nails._
_ Sutra 67 and 68 emphasize conquering the 'jall parisah' (minor transgressions). Even if a monk is unable to conquer the 'jall parisah' due to his capabilities, the circumstances, or the time, he should not act contrary to the principles of these 'parisahjay' (conquering transgressions)._

## Atonement for Covering the Head in the Monastery

69. If a monk covers his head while traveling from village to village, or approves of someone doing so, (he incurs a minor monthly atonement).

Discussion: "Sissass Avaranam Sissduvaram" - Covering the head in the monastery, while going out for alms, or while going elsewhere for other reasons, is considered 'ling-viparayas' (gender inversion) because covering the head while going out is a woman's attire. Therefore, a sadhu who covers his head while going out or coming in, or while traveling in the monastery, without any reason or in ordinary circumstances, incurs atonement. Covering the head due to old age, illness, or unbearable heat or cold is considered 'sakaran'. For a sadhvi, not covering the head due to 'ling-viparayas' should be considered atonement. Covering the head while sitting in the 'upashray' (monastery) should not be considered atonement. There is a tradition of covering the head while going out to relieve oneself at night, so this should not be considered atonement either. However, there is no clear provision for this tradition in the scriptures.

From Sutra 16 to 69, 54 Sutras discuss the atonement for performing bodily functions 'on one's own'. The meaning is that performing these functions without any reason [simply out of inclination] incurs a minor monthly atonement. 

Page #184:
---------------------------
## 84]
[Nihianga]
The six sutras of "Vana" and the six sutras of "Gandamala" etc., totaling twelve sutras, have a different nature in terms of their causality and non-causality compared to the other 42 sutras. This difference has been explained in its respective place. The essence of this difference is:

1. In the 42 sutras, performing an action without a cause is considered worthy of atonement.
2. In the 12 sutras, the goal is not to endure as much as possible, but to seek immediate treatment, which is considered worthy of atonement.

This group of 54 sutras is a single Alapaka or Gamaka, whose purpose is also mentioned in the other Uddesakas 4, 6, 7, 11, 15, and 17. The original text and the interpretation of the meaning of this Uddesaka are mentioned everywhere. Therefore, it should be understood again from this concise table.

16-21: Sutras for Foot Care
22-27: Sutras for Body Care
28-33: Sutras for Wound Treatment
34-39: Sutras for Surgical Treatment of Gandamala etc.
40: Sutra for Worm Removal
42-47: Sutras for Nail Care
48-50: Sutras for Hair Care (Janga, Vatthi, Romarai, Kakkha, Uttarottha, and Mansu)
51-56: Sutras for Teeth Care
57-63: Sutras for Lip Care
64-69: Sutras for Eye Care
70-75: Sutras for Hair Care (Nasa, Bhamug, Kesain)
76: Sutra for Preventing Perspiration
77-82: Sutras for Eye, Ear, Teeth, Nail, and Feces Removal
83: Sutra for Covering the Head

This third Uddesaka explains the atonement for performing an action without a cause oneself. The fourth Uddesaka explains the atonement for performing an action without a cause between a Sadhu and another Sadhu.

The sixth and seventh Uddesakas explain the atonement for performing an action without a cause due to sexual desire, both by oneself and between a Sadhu and another Sadhu.

The eleventh Uddesaka explains the atonement for a Sadhu performing these actions for a householder.

The fifteenth Uddesaka explains the atonement for a householder performing these actions, and for performing them oneself with the intention of adornment, as explained by two Alapakas. 

Page #185:
---------------------------
## Second Objective

[In the 85th objective of the 17th objective, the atonement for a Sadhu performing a ritual for a Grihastha and a Sadhvi performing a ritual for a Sadhu has been stated.
In this way, these 54 sutras have been repeated a total of nine times in the Nishita Sutra, apart from other expectations.
Just as in this objective, the atonement for these 54 sutras is for performing these actions without a reason, similarly in other objectives, wherever there are other general sutras related to the actions of the body and instruments (without instructions for adornment, sexual intercourse, household service, etc.), atonement should be understood as being for performing them without a reason. In this regard, there are also the following Agam proofs in addition to the Churni Bhashya:
**Regarding Upadhi:**
1. If one discards their Upadhi even though it is fit for use, then atonement - Ni. U. 5.
2. If one gives an Upadhi to a Grihastha, then also atonement - Ni. U. 15.
3. In the sutras regarding atonement for carrying, stitching, binding, sewing, etc. of clothes and vessels, atonement for doing more than three times the number of the least severe action - Ni. U. 1.
4. Atonement for sewing, etc. work done improperly - Ni. U. 1. If the intention of the Agam was to perform these actions with or without a reason, then instead of the above, there would be statements like - "Atonement for sewing, binding, carrying, stitching, etc. of clothes, whether done properly or improperly." But instead, atonement has been stated in the above-mentioned sutras. Therefore, it is clear that there is no atonement in the case of a reason.
**Regarding the Body:**
1. Atonement for removing earwax, atonement for cutting nails - Ni. U. 3.
2. Atonement for using a needle, scissors, nail cleaner, ear cleaner for a purpose different from the one for which it was taken, i.e., atonement for using it for the intended purpose - Ni. U. 1.
3. Prohibition of using stale oil, etc. or pastes, ointments, etc. - Brihatkalpa U. 5.
4. Two Chaubhangis of atonement for using pastes and cow dung applied during the day at night - Ni. U. 12.
5. Atonement for performing bodily rituals or taking medication even when healthy - Ni. U. 13.
If the intention of the Agam was to prohibit or state atonement for all bodily rituals without distinction between with or without a reason, then there would be a clear statement about atonement for simply taking a nail cleaner, etc.

[Nishītha Sūtra
It is said that the prāyaścitta for merely consuming a leppable substance is a prāyaścitta, and the prāyaścitta for merely consuming medicine is a prāyaścitta. There are no other alternative sūtras of this type.
_ The meaning of these sūtras is that they are prāyaścitta sūtras for the uncaused karma of the body and instruments. The decision of uncaused and caused can only be made by a gītartha. It is not proper for anyone to wander without a gītartha or without the guidance of a gītartha. Brihatkalpa Bhāṣya Gā. 688 ||
The words gītartha and bahuśruta are both indicative of the same meaning. In the āgamas, the word bahuśruta is often used, and in the commentary texts, the word "gītartha" is used. The explanation of gītartha is in Brihatkalpa Bhāṣya Pothikā Gā. 693.
The explanation of bahuśruta is in Nishītha Bhāṣya Pīthikā Gā. 495. There is uniformity in both explanations. That explanation is as follows:
"One who has memorized the Jghana Ācārāṅga Sūtra and the Nishītha Sūtra along with their meaning, along with the practice of many āgamas and adherence to the prācāra."
'One who is a holder of the excellent 14 pūrvas.'
And in the middle, one who has memorized at least the Pācārāṅga, Nishītha, Sūyagaḍāṅga, Daśaśruta Skandha, Brihatkalpa and Vyavahāra Sūtra.
This is the explanation for bahuśruta and this is the explanation for gītartha. The meaning of 'holding' in the āgama is to memorize the original and the meaning. Because there is also a prāyaścitta statement for forgetting these āgamas, and there is no prāyaścitta for a sthavira forgetting. This is described in Vyav. U. 5.
_ Therefore, it is proper to wander only with the guidance of a gītartha (or bahuśruta) of this qualification, and to decide on exceptions with their guidance. The prohibition of the unqualified becoming prominent and wandering is in Vyav. U. 3 Sūtra 1. Vasīkaraṇa Sūtra - Karana Prāyaścitta

**Discussion:**

* *Uccāra* is a synonym for *baḍī nīta*, *mala*, *aśuci*, *saṇṇā*, *vacca*, *pāsavana*, *laghu nīta*, *mūtra*, *kāyikī*, *mutta*, etc.
* Here, the emphasis is on *baḍī nīta*, and *laghu nīta* is almost always present with *baḍī nīta*. Therefore, the term "Uccāra-pāsavana" is used together.
* The commentator has also explained this with emphasis on *baḍī nīta*.
* **House:** The term "house" refers to the entire house, including all its parts and the open ground.
* The text specifically mentions six possible places, so the remaining rooms, kitchen, etc. are considered to be included in the "house" as a whole.

**Gṛha-mukha** - The platform (chowki) or enclosed area in front of the house. The main entrance of the house - a large pole, with an area as wide as the pole and slightly longer. The secondary entrance of the house - a small door inside after entering through the main entrance pole.
**Gṛha-eluka** - The raised "sal" on both sides of the door, i.e., the area built on both sides after entering through the main entrance.
**Gṛha-āṅgan** - The courtyard inside the house, between the rooms.
**Gṛha-vaccha** - The open land behind and around the house, or the land used by the household for excreting waste.
**2. Mṛtaka-gṛha** - The place where the deceased is kept before cremation in the cremation ground. The place where the ashes remain after the deceased's cremation with alkali. In other words, the cremation site.
**Mṛtaka-stūpa** - A platform, etc., built for remembrance.
**Mṛtaka-pāśraya** - The place where the deceased is sheltered, i.e., kept for a short time, before entering the cremation ground.
**Mṛtaka-lyan** - A chaitya or platform built for remembrance at the cremation site.
**Mṛtaka-sthaṇḍila** - The place where the burnt bones, etc., of the deceased are disposed of.
**Mṛtaka-vaccha** - Other open land in the cremation ground that may be used for cremation or burial.
**3. Gāyadāhansi** - A designated place where animals are treated by applying a poultice for their ailments.
**- Tusadāhansi - Bhusadāhansi** - Tus - The husk of grain or grain containing husk. Bhus - The entire waste of grain stalks.
There can be two types of places for burning these: 1. A place near the field for burning unusable tus-bhus. 2. A place where potters, etc., burn tus-bhus as fuel.
The **Niśītha Bhāṣya** and the **Prācārāṅga Sūtra. Śru. 2, A. 10** commentary do not explain these two words. It explains the three words "**Ingāladāhansi, Khāradāhansi, and Gātadāhansi**".
These two words are not found in the **Ācārāṅga Sūtra**.
In **Niśītha**, the variant reading of these two words is "**Tustāṇansi vā Bhusthāṇansi vā**". This means the place where these are collected or kept near the field - "**Khalīhāna**".
Thus, even when these five places mentioned in the sūtra are empty, one should not excrete waste there.

[Nishīthasūtra
4. In the context of the violation of the earth, in the 10th chapter, verse 4, the text "na ālihijjā na vilihijjā" appears. Its meaning is to draw lines on the earth with a weapon or something similar. Here, the word "liha" with the word "go" is used, which means "land plowed by a bull or other animal with a plow." That land is new and immediate, meaning it is 1-2 days old, so it is sentient. Therefore, it is essential to avoid it. If a householder is using that new, freshly dug land, it is still inconceivable due to its sentience, and even if they are not using it, it is still inconceivable.
Some time before the rains, farmers plow the land and leave it. Whether people go there for defecation or not, as long as it is new, there is a possibility of sentience or mixture, so a monk should not go there. When it becomes non-sentient, it is no longer called new.
Interpreting it this way, the subject of both "maṭṭiyā khāṇī" and "golehaṇiyā" becomes the same, making the adjectives "abhiṇaviyāsu" and "paribhujjamāṇa aparibhujjamāṇa" meaningful and consistent.
5. "Kaddamabahulaṁ pāṇīyaṁ - seobhaṇṇati, tassa āyataṇaṁ - seyāyayanaṁ."
A place where there is more mud and less water is called "seyāyayanaṁ." After the rains, this kind of mud forms, and there are also flowers (some) there. Therefore, due to the violation, there is atonement for stepping on it.
6. The sūtra mentions the collection places of some fruits like banyan, peepal, etc. Similarly, other fruit collection places should be understood.
7. The Chūrṇīkāra has not explained sūtras 77-78-79. He has only said that "these are words known to the people."
The commentator has explained that in the places mentioned in sūtras 71 to 79, if one defecates, there is a fault because the owner of the house, etc., may be angry and, in contempt, push the impure person down or throw the impure thing on the monk. In cremation grounds, etc., there is a possibility of the Vyantara devata being angry. In places like sentient earth, etc., there is violation of life.
Except for the violation of life, in non-sentient places where other people generally defecate or where the owner allows it, there is no atonement for stepping on it.
In sūtra 74, there is violation of the earth body, in sūtra 75, there is violation of the non-earth body, in sūtra 72, there is deception of the gods, and in the remaining sūtras (71, 73, 76, 77, 78, 79), there is a possibility of being scorned and criticized by the owner.
Avidhi-pariṣṭhāpana atonement
80. If a monk, while walking, takes a step on a piece of cloth or a piece of wood that is being thrown away, or if he goes on a different path, he should turn the cloth or wood around and follow the sun. He should do this or he should be silent.

Second Objective]
Serving this, the minor monthly atonement arises from the transgression of the prohibition of defecation.
One who, being afflicted by the urge of excretion in the day, night, or twilight, takes his own vessel or requests the vessel of another monk, discards the excretion therein, and defecates in a place where the sun's light (heat) does not reach, or approves of one who does so.
The consumption of these 80 Sutra-based transgressions leads to the minor monthly atonement.
Discussion - "Aṇuggaē sūriē" is directly interpreted as "not defecating before sunrise," but this meaning is not in accordance with the Agamas and is therefore inappropriate. The reasons for this are:
1. The word "diā vā" used in the Sutra becomes meaningless. Because, in comparison to one who has defecated during the day, the sentence "Aṇuggaē sūriē" does not make sense.
2. Leaving excrement overnight causes harm to the microscopic beings and also leads to the inability to study due to impurity.
3. Defecation at night is completely prohibited.
4. The transcription of the excretion-land in the fourth watch of the night also becomes meaningless.
5. This meaning also contradicts many instructions from the Ācāra Sūtra.
Therefore, it is reasonable to understand this atonement Sutra as meaning defecation in a shady place where the sun's light (heat) never reaches, either during the day or night.
The method of discarding excretion into a vessel and then defecating is instructed in Ācārāṅga Śruti 2, A. 10, and in this Sutra. However, the combined meaning of other Agama texts and this ordinance is that if a suitable obstacle, suitable time, and suitable defecation ground are available, one should go to the defecation ground and defecate. But if there is a strong urge to defecate or if there is no suitable time to go some distance, such as during twilight or night, midday in the summer, or if there is no faultless defecation ground nearby, etc., one can go to a secluded place in the shelter and defecate in a vessel, and then defecate in a suitable place.
Sutras 71 to 79 describe the atonement for defecating in an unsuitable place, which includes harming the earth, water, and gods, deceiving, and the possibility of incurring the wrath of the master, public censure, etc. In accordance with this Sutra 80, one should avoid the aforementioned unsuitable places, and also pay attention to whether the sun's rays reach the defecation place or not. If the sun's rays do not reach, it will not dry quickly, leading to the generation of microscopic beings and prolonged harm. For this reason, the Sutra states the atonement for improper defecation.
If there are worms in someone's impurity, one should sit in the shade or defecate after a while (10-20 minutes).

##  Fourfold  Determinants

**Penance for Subduing Kings and Others**

1. A monk who subdues a king or approves of one who subdues a king.
2. A monk who subdues a king's bodyguard or approves of one who subdues a king's bodyguard.
3. A monk who subdues a city guard or approves of one who subdues a city guard.
4. A monk who subdues a guild guard or approves of one who subdues a guild guard.
5. A monk who subdues a universal protector or approves of one who subdues a universal protector. - (He incurs the minor monthly penance.)

**Explanation:**

* **Atikareï:** To make favorable or to subdue.

There are proper and improper reasons and methods for subduing. Here, the minor monthly penance is mentioned for subduing with a proper reason and through proper effort. The rest of the explanation can be found in the commentary.

The commentary states that subduing kings and their relatives can hinder restraint and practice, and if they are unfavorable, they can also cause obstacles.

If it is necessary to make kings and others favorable for the benefit of the Sangha in times of special crisis, this is a proper reason. Subduing them through the merit gained from one's own restraint and tapas is a proper effort.

Subduing them through deceitful and sinful practices is an improper effort. 

Page #196:
---------------------------
## Nishīthসূত্র

To enhance someone's reputation, to harm someone, or to subdue someone for selfish reasons are all improper motives. The atonement for this is severe.

The Sūyagḍāṅg Sūtra, Chapter 1, Section 2, Verse 2, Line 18 also states: "Saṁsaggi asāhu rāihiṁ, asamahi u tahagayassa vi."

"For a practitioner engaged in the practice of self-restraint, association with kings and their company is not appropriate, as such association can lead to distraction from self-restraint." Therefore, practitioners should avoid personal contact with such individuals.

If kings, etc., come to them for Dharmaśravaṇa, etc., there is no fault in trying to make them Dharma-loving. The atonement for praising kings, etc., is:

6. The monk who praises the king, or approves of those who praise him.
7. The monk who praises the king's bodyguard, or approves of those who praise him.
8. The monk who praises the city guard, or approves of those who praise him.
9. The monk who praises the guild guard, or approves of those who praise him.
10. The monk who praises the universal protector, or approves of those who praise him. (He incurs the atonement of a small monthly penance.)

**Discussion:**

"Acchīkarei" refers to praising someone's virtues, such as bravery, in their presence or absence. These sūtras are related to the "Attikarei" sūtras, which describe a method of subduing someone. In essence, the easiest way to win someone over is to praise them in their presence or absence. Therefore, these "Acchīkarei atonement sūtras" should be understood as complementary to the "Attikarei" sūtras.

---------------------------
## Fourth Uddeshaka: 
**Penance for Attracting the King and Others**

11. A monk who makes the king his *arthi* (object of attraction) or approves of someone who does so.
12. A monk who makes the king's protector his *arthi* or approves of someone who does so.
13. A monk who makes the city protector his *arthi* or approves of someone who does so.
14. A monk who makes the guild protector his *arthi* or approves of someone who does so.
15. A monk who makes the universal protector his *arthi* or approves of someone who does so. (He incurs the *laghumasik* penance.)

**Discussion:**

There are three meanings of *prathikarei*:

1. The monk prays to the king.
2. The monk performs actions that cause the king to pray to him.
3. The monk fulfills a task for the king.

These are the types of *arthi* (attraction). Alternatively, the monk may tell the king, "I possess such and such knowledge, *nimittagyan* (knowledge of causes), or knowledge of specific periods, etc." These are all means of attracting the king.

*Arthi* is also a type of *prati* (acceptance). Therefore, the *arthi* sutras should be understood as complementary to the *prati* sutras.

Of the three meanings of *arthi*, the latter two seem more relevant than the first. The first meaning, praying to the king, is already included in the *acchikarei* sutras. The meaning of attracting the king through the power of one's austerities is more relevant to the context. Therefore, the meaning of *prathikarei* is to attract them to oneself.

In summary, these 15 sutras state that one should not have any inclination to make the king or others their own. The etymology of the remaining words is as follows...

---------------------------
## Nishīthasūtra

**1. Rāyarakkhiyam:** One who protects the king is a Rāyarakkhiyo - Siroraksah - King's bodyguard.
**2. Nagararakkhiyam:** One who protects the city is a Nagararakkhiyo - Kottāpāl - Kotwal.
**3. Nigmarakkhiyam:** One who protects all the people is a Nigmarakkhiyo - Seththi - Nagaraseth.
**4. Savvarakkhiyam:** One who protects all these is a Savvarakkhiyo - He is the one who should be consulted in all matters and is the one with great power - Advisor in all matters.

**Penance for controlling the Gram-Rakshak etc.**
**16.** A monk who controls the Gram-Rakshak or approves of the one who controls him, will be punished.
**17.** A monk who controls the Desaraksak or approves of the one who controls him, will be punished.
**18.** A monk who controls the Simaraksak or approves of the one who controls him, will be punished.
**19.** A monk who controls the Ranṇaraksak or approves of the one who controls him, will be punished.
**20.** A monk who controls the Savvaraksak or approves of the one who controls him, will be punished. (He will be given a Laghumāsik penance).

## Fourth Uddesaka

**21.** A monk who praises or approves of the praise of a **Gramaraakshaka** (protector of the village).
**22.** A monk who praises or approves of the praise of a **Desharaakshaka** (protector of the country).
**23.** A monk who praises or approves of the praise of a **Seemaraakshaka** (protector of the boundaries).
**24.** A monk who praises or approves of the praise of a **Raajaraakshaka** (protector of the king).
**25.** A monk who praises or approves of the praise of a **Sarvaraakshaka** (protector of all). (He incurs **Laghumaasik Praayaaschitta** (minor monthly atonement)). This atonement applies to attracting **Gramaraakshaka** etc.

**26.** A monk who attracts a **Gramaraakshaka** or approves of someone who attracts a **Gramaraakshaka**.
**27.** A monk who attracts a **Desharaakshaka** or approves of someone who attracts a **Desharaakshaka**.

**30.** A monk who attracts a **Sarvaraakshaka** or approves of someone who attracts a **Sarvaraakshaka**. (He incurs **Laghumaasik Praayaaschitta** (minor monthly atonement)).

**Discussion:** The commentary in the **Churni** only hints at the subject of these sutras, stating: "And this **Pannaras** sutra is to be recited." The meaning is the same as before. The commentary verse states: "In attracting etc., the meaning of the king etc. has been stated."

## 100]
[Nishith Sutra 100 and Nirvaseso, Gamadarakkhimadi in 1854. || 1. Gramarakshaka - Village protectors - Sarpanch etc.
2. Desharakshaka - Protectors of specific divisions like districts etc. - District Magistrate etc. or those who protect the country from thieves etc.
3. Simarakshaka - Protectors of the border areas of the state. 4. Ranarakshaka - Protectors of the state - Governor etc. 5. Savvarakshaka - In all these areas, they are the chief advisors.
The first 15 Sutras are related to the king and the capital, and these 15 Sutras are related to the entire state. This is the reason for dividing these 15-15 Sutras into two separate divisions. "Sarvarakshaka" is mentioned in both divisions. 1 - In all the tasks of the first division, they are to be consulted. 2 - In all the tasks of the second division, they are to be given permission. Understanding this meaning clarifies the difference between the two.
There are variations in the number and order of these Sutras in many copies. The number is 24, 27, 30, 40 etc. The order is sometimes 40 together, sometimes 24 together, sometimes some Sutras are in the Uddeshaka and some are in between the Uddeshaka. Sometimes there are 5 or 6 Attikarei Sutras, while sometimes only three Sutras related to the king are given, followed by three Sutras related to the king's protector. There are many such orders. These variations are due to the mistakes of the scribes. Since there is no impropriety of any kind, the text with 30 Sutras has been taken here, and the order and number have been given according to the Churni and Bhashya.
The "Nisihjhayanam" published by the Terapanthi Mahasabha has divided the 15-15 Sutras into two divisions and has given a note for the second division:
_"Etani sutrani uddeshakadisutrebyah kimartham prithakkrutani iti na charcitamasti bhashyachadao" - Page 28. || Prāyaschitta for eating whole grain
31. Je bhikkhu "kasinao" osahio ahareï, aharatam vā saijjai.
The monk who eats "whole" medicines (whole grain etc.) or approves of the one who does so. (He incurs a minor monthly prāyaschitta.)
Discussion - "Kasina" - There are four parts of these two types: dravyakrtsna and bhavakrtsna. Dravyakrtsna means whole and bhavakrtsna means with consciousness. Here, the subject of prāyaschitta is involved, so the meaning of "bhavakrtsna" (with consciousness) should be taken.
"Osahïro" - It should be understood as grains and other seeds containing every living being by implication.
Therefore, the meaning of the Sutra is that eating whole grain and seeds with consciousness incurs a minor monthly prāyaschitta. 

Page #201:
---------------------------
## Fourth Uddeshak

[101] The first and second two bhangas in the fourfold classification of dravya and bhava are related to the soul, and their pratyachitt is as described. There is no pratyachitt mentioned in the sutras for the two bhangas related to the non-soul.

The commentator has mentioned pratyachitt for "achitt akhand" as well, but this cannot be the intention of the sutrakar. The following passages should be considered:

1. "Adu javaitth luhenam, ayanam manthukummassenam." Pra. Su. 1, A. 9, U. 4, Ga. 4
2. "Avi suiyam va sukkam va, sipidam puranakummasan." Adu bukkasan va pulagam va, laddhe pinde aladdhe davie. Pra. Su. 1, A. 9, U. 4, Ga. 13
3. "Ayamgam cheva javodanam cha, siyam sovir-javodagam cha." Utt. A. 15, Ga. 13
4. "Patani cheva sevejja, siyar yapadam puranakummasan. Adu bukkasan pulagam va, javanatthae nisevae manthu." Utt. A. 8, Ga. 12
5. "Dasavai. A. 5. U. 1, Ga. 98" mentions "manthukummāsabhoyānam."

It is clear from the above passages that Bhagwan Mahavir Swami consumed food like rice, urad dal, etc., which are achitt akhand. The Uttaradhyayanasutra mentions the consumption of "jav" (barley) porridge and urad dal sprouts. Even today, porridge made from rice, bajra, barley, etc., and dishes made from whole moong dal, chana dal, etc., are common.

Therefore, it is not appropriate to consider the consumption of achitt akhand grains like rice, etc., as requiring pratyachitt. Instead, it should be understood as pratyachitt for the consumption of sachit grains and seeds.

The pratyachitt for knowingly consuming sachit grains and unknowingly consuming them is different. This should be understood from the pratyachitt table given at the beginning of the first uddeshak.

## Pratyachitt for consuming vigaya without permission

32. "Je bhikkhu ayariy-uvjjaaehi avidinnam annayaran vigai ahare, aharetam va saijjai."

A monk who consumes any vigaya without the specific permission of the acharya or upadhyaya, or who approves of someone else doing so, incurs laghumasik pratyachitt.

## Explanation

1. If the acharya or upadhyaya is present, then their permission should be sought. Otherwise, the permission of the upadhyaya should be sought, or, by implication, the permission of the senior monk or sthavir under whose guidance or in whose company the monk is living.

2. A sadhu always seeks permission before consuming food. However, this permission only allows for the consumption of food without vigaya. If it is necessary to consume vigaya like ghee or milk, then specific permission should be sought.

According to general practice, a sadhu can only consume food without vigaya. If it is necessary to consume food with vigaya due to special circumstances, then the sadhu cannot consume vigaya without the permission of the acharya. 

Page #202:
---------------------------
## 102]

[This is the Nishītha Sutra. They also give permission to consume *vigaya* after understanding the necessity and deciding the quantity. In the absence of the *prācārya*, permission can also be taken from the *upādhyāya*. Because both these degree holders are *gītartha* only. In the absence of both of them, permission can also be taken from the one who is the main *gītartha*. It is not permissible for any monk to wander without the subordination or proximity of the *gītartha*.

3. *Aṇṇayarṁ vigaiṁ* - any *vigaya* from the five *vigayas*. The five *vigayas* are: 1. Milk, 2. Curd, 3. Ghee, 4. Oil, and 5. Jaggery-Sugar.

In the ninth *ṭhāṇa* of the *Ṭhāṇāṅga Sutra*, nine *vigayas* are mentioned, and out of them, four *vigayas* are called *mahāvigaya* in the fourth *ṭhāṇa*. Therefore, by implication, the remaining five are called *vigayas*. The four *mahāvigayas* are: 1. Butter, 2. Honey, 3. Alcohol, 4. Meat. Out of these, two, alcohol and meat, are *aprashasta mahāvigaya*, and are completely forbidden for the seeker, because the consumption of alcohol and meat is said to be the cause of hell in the fourth *ṭhāṇa* of the *Ṭhāṇāṅga Sutra*.

In *Daśavai. Cha. 2, Gā. 7*, the monk is called "**amjjamansāsi**". That is, the monk does not consume alcohol or meat.

Generally, the consumption of the five *vigayas* is forbidden, so the question of consuming *mahāvigaya* does not arise. However, honey and butter *mahāvigaya* are not completely unacceptable.

The consumption of all five *vigayas* can be done only after taking permission in case of unavoidable necessity, and the consumption of the two *prashasta mahāvigayas* cannot be done without fear of disease, etc. The following verses are from the *āgamas* regarding the prohibition of *vigaya*:

1. *Lahvitti susantuṭhe.*
   - *Daśavai. A. 8, Gā. 25*
2. *Paṇīyarasabhoyanaṁ visan tālauḍaṁ jahā.*
   - *Daśavai. A. 8, Gā. 57*
3. *Paṇṭāṇi ceva sevejjā, sīyapīṇḍapurāṇakummāsaṁ.  _ Adu bukkasaṁ pulāgaṁ vā, javaṇṭṭāe nisevae mathu.*
   - *Uttara. A. 1, Gāthā 12*
4. *ṇo hīlae piḍaṁ nīrasaṁ tu, paṇṭakulāiṁ parivvaē sa bhikku.*
   - *Uttara. A. 15, Gā. 13*
5. *Paṇīyaṁ bhattapāṇaṁ tu, khippaṁ mayavivaddanaṁ.  Bambačeraraō bhikku, niccaso parivajjāe.*
   - *Uttara. A. 16, Gā. 7*
6. *Duddha dahi vigaiō, āhārei abhikkhaṇaṁ.  _ Arae ya tavokamme, pāvasamaṇe tti vucchai.*
   - *Uttara. A. 17, Gā. 15*
7. *Abhikkhaṇaṁ nivigaiṁ gaya ya.*
   - *Daś. Chū. 2. Gā. 7*
8. *Rasā pagāmaṁ na niseviyavvā, pāyaṁ rasā dittikarā garāṇaṁ.*
   - *Uttara. A. 32, Gā. 10*
9. *Vigaiṁ nijjahaṇaṁ kare.*
   - *Uttara. A. 36, Gā. 255*
10. *Tao no kappati vāittae-avīṇīe, vigaipaḍibaddhe, avioṣaviā pāhuḍe.*
   - *Bṛhat. U. 4*

## Fourth Uddeshak

[103 11. The five types of food that are always to be avoided by the Samanas, the Nigganthas, the Bhagavaya Mahavorena, are: 1. Arasahare, 2. Virasahare, 3. Antahaare, 4. Pantahaare, 5. Luhahaare.
-Thanam. A. 5 This Sutra is a Sutra of atonement for taking food that was given in many previous copies of this Sutra, which has come to be after the commentary and Churnivyakhya due to a scribal error or some other reason. This Sutra is not included in the "Nisihajzhayana" published by the Terapanth Mahasabha.
33. The monk who enters the house of a householder for food without knowing the "Thavanakulai", without asking, without investigating, or who approves of the one who enters, (he receives a minor monthly atonement).
Discussion - "Thavanakulai" is a family that is not suitable for begging. There are many types of such families:
1. Extremely hateful families are to be completely avoided. 2. Extremely affectionate families, 3. Families living near the shelter,
4. Families with valuable goods or special medicines are considered to be for ordinary monks. For children, the sick, the elderly, the teacher, the guest, etc., only experienced and knowledgeable monks can go to these houses for begging if necessary.
This statement is made in relation to the expectation of those who bring separate Gochari for the monks who are wandering with a large group of monks or who are staying in the old age home.
Ajanij, Apuchchij, Agavesij - Without asking, one gets "information" from someone else's telling or from direct or indirect knowledge. If you don't have information, you should ask for it. Asking about name, lineage, caste, etc. is called "Pricha". Understanding the location of the house from signs or signals is called "Gaveshana".
Or, for a former acquaintance, it is "Pricha", and for an unfamiliar person, it is "Pricha-युक्त Gaveshana".
Going for Gochari without knowing can lead to going to Thavanakulai, which can lead to disorder and the fault of not giving, and it can be difficult to obtain special items when needed. 

Page #204:
---------------------------
##  Nishīthasūtra Commentary

The commentary on the Nishīthasūtra mentions both worldly prohibited families and families that are prohibited due to sleeping together, but their atonement is mentioned elsewhere.

Therefore, in this context, the families established by the elders for going on alms-round during times of essential need should be understood as the established families.

**Atonement for entering a nunnery improperly**

34. A monk who enters a nunnery improperly or approves of someone entering improperly (incurs a minor monthly atonement).

**Discussion:** The commentator has described the reasons why a monk may enter a nunnery, and has mentioned the many potential faults of entering improperly.

"Improperly" refers to entering without giving prior notice, i.e., entering silently.

"Properly" refers to staying outside the nunnery, i.e., outside the main entrance, and informing them of one's arrival with words of address. After some time has passed for the nuns to be informed, one may enter. Alternatively, after giving notice, one may enter when a nun signals with a word like "Come in."

There is also an explanation that one should pronounce the word "Nisihi" when entering, but this explanation does not seem appropriate. This is because every nun has a specific way of pronouncing this word when entering the nunnery. Therefore, the appropriate signal for a monk's entry should be a different word, or one should enter after being informed by a lay person.

The point is that the nuns should be aware of the monk's entry. Entering without the reasons mentioned in the scriptures is also improper entry. For more information, one should study the commentary.

**Atonement for placing objects in the path of a nun's arrival**

35. A monk who places a staff, stick, broom, face-cloth, or any other object in the path of a nun's arrival, or approves of someone doing so (incurs a minor monthly atonement).

**Discussion:** When it is time for the nuns to arrive at the monastery, no objects should be placed in their path. Besides the path, until reaching the Acharya or others, 

Page #205:
---------------------------
## Fourth Uddeshak [105]

**The place should also be understood as the path here.** This atonement arises when an instrument is placed on the path due to lack of discretion or curiosity.

Placing an instrument on the path carelessly while sitting in front of the Acharya, etc., while showing food or doing other work, is called placing it with discretion.

If it is placed due to other worldly thoughts, the atonement of Guru Chaumasi arises.

**Atonement for creating new strife**

36. **The monk who creates new strife or approves of the one who creates it.** (He incurs the atonement of Laghu-Masik.)

**Discussion:** Strife arises from natural argumentativeness or pointless speech. Strife can also arise from humor or curiosity. Therefore, the monk should be discreet.

In the Suyagadaang Sutra 02, 02, Ga. 19, while teaching, it is said:

"**Ahigaran kadasa bhikkhuno, vayamanassa pasajja darunam. Parihai bahu, ahigaranam na karejja pandie.**"

**Causing strife leads to great loss of restraint, while speaking harsh words increases harmony and peace among people. Therefore, the monk should always stay away from strife and the causes of its origin.**

**Atonement for stirring up settled strife**

37. **The monk who rekindles old strife that has been settled through apology or approves of the one who does so.** (He incurs the atonement of Laghu-Masik.)

**Discussion:**

1. **Khamiy:** "Khamiy - Vayae" - Apologizing with proper words.
2. **Viosmiy:** "Manasa Viosmiyavyutrushtam" - Churni. To remove strife from the mind, to abandon it, to settle it.

**One should be fully discreet towards the person or the occasion that caused or could cause strife. One should try to keep one's nature calm as much as possible. Otherwise, one should stay away from those topics or occasions. Even with discretion, if there is a possibility of strife, one should stay away from that person's contact. One should understand the effect of one's karma-udaya and the nature or the arising of the particular person, and act with discretion accordingly.**

---------------------------
##  [Nishīth Sūtra, Prāyaścitta of Hāraya]

**38. A monk who laughs with his mouth wide open or encourages others to laugh.** (He incurs a minor monthly penance.)

**Discussion:** This refers to the penance for laughing excessively or in an inappropriate manner. The Daśavaikalika Sūtra states that monks should always be engaged in self-study, knowledge, and meditation, rather than wasting time in idle chatter and laughter. As it says:

"Do not indulge in much sleep, avoid excessive laughter. Do not delight in worldly pleasures, but remain absorbed in contemplation." - Daśavaikalika Sūtra, Chapter 8, Verse 42

The Ācārāṅga Sūtra states that a monk who abandons laughter is a true Niggantha, therefore a monk should not laugh. As it says:

"A Niggantha recognizes laughter, he does not laugh." - Ācārāṅga Sūtra, Chapter 2, Section 16

A monk should be free from curiosity and have a serious nature, and should not associate with those who are curious.

This kind of laughter is a cause of attachment or it encourages others to laugh. It also leads to public censure. It also violates the air element and the life of sentient beings. It can also lead to the humiliation, anger, or hatred of others.

The commentator gives an example:

"A king and queen were sitting together in a window. Looking towards the royal path, the queen said, "A dead man is laughing." When the king asked, the queen pointed towards a monk and explained that by renouncing all worldly pleasures, he is like a dead man, yet he is still laughing."

Therefore, a monk should not laugh loudly, but only smile moderately.

**39. A monk who gives a "Pārsvastha" (side-by-side) offering.** (He incurs a minor monthly penance.)

**40. A monk who accepts a "Pārsvastha" offering.** (He incurs a minor monthly penance.)

**41. A monk who gives an "Osanna" (offering to the sick) offering.** (He incurs a minor monthly penance.)

**42. A monk who accepts an "Osanna" offering.** (He incurs a minor monthly penance.)

**43. A monk who gives a "Kusīla" (offering to the virtuous) offering.** (He incurs a minor monthly penance.)

## Fourth Objective]
[107 44. A monk who gives a *sanghāḍa* to a *kuśīlas* or approves of the giver. 45. A monk who gives a *sanghāḍa* to a *samsattas* or approves of the giver. 46. A monk who receives a *sanghāḍa* from a *samsattas* or approves of the receiver. 47. A monk who gives a *sanghāḍa* to a *nityas* or approves of the giver. 48. A monk who receives a *sanghāḍa* from a *nityas* or approves of the receiver. 39. A monk who gives a *sanghāḍa* to a *pārśvastha* or approves of the giver.
40. A monk who receives a *sanghāḍa* from a *pārśvastha* or approves of the receiver.
41. A monk who gives a *sanghāḍa* to an *avasanna* or approves of the giver.
42. A monk who receives a *sanghāḍa* from an *avasanna* or approves of the receiver.
43. A monk who gives a *sanghāḍa* to a *kuśīla* or approves of the giver.
44. A monk who receives a *sanghāḍa* from a *kuśīla* or approves of the receiver.
45. A monk who gives a *sanghāḍa* to a *samsakta* or approves of the giver.
46. A monk who receives a *sanghāḍa* from a *samsakta* or approves of the receiver.
47. A monk who gives a *sanghāḍa* to a *nityaka* or approves of the giver.
48. A monk who receives a *sanghāḍa* from a *nityaka* or approves of the receiver. (He incurs the *laghumāsika* penance.)
Discussion - 'Sanghāḍa' - A group of two or more monks is called a *sanghāṭaka* (*sanghāḍa*) and a group of many *sanghāṭakas* is called a *gaṇa* or *gaccha*. In the *āgama*, the word *gaṇa* is sometimes used for *sanghāṭaka* as well.
Giving a monk to someone to live as a *sanghāṭaka* is also called giving a *sanghāḍa*.
These sutras state the penance for giving a *sanghāḍa*, i.e., giving one's own monk to live with *pāsattā* etc.
Living with *pāsattā* etc. and going together on *gocari* can lead to conflict due to differences in conduct or investigation, or it can lead to disrespect for the Jain teachings in various ways, and it can also lead to

[108]
The investigation and acceptance of the impure Nishītha Sūtra, as well as the karma-bandha caused by it, is not considered appropriate. Therefore, it is not permissible to give or receive it from a sadhu, whether one or many.
The implication is that in external behavior, only those who share similar conduct and thoughts should be associated with, as this allows for the peaceful completion of the practice of restraint and ensures that behavior remains pure.
The nature of Pāsaththa, etc.
1. Pāsaththa-Pāvastha: - Every substance has two sides - one right, the other wrong. The diligent conduct of a restrained life is the right side, and the relaxed conduct of an unrestrained life is the wrong side of a restrained life.
"In Darshan, Jnana, Charitra, Tapa, and Pravachana, those who have established their soul, the Pārsva-vihārī, i.e., those who do not follow their conduct, should be considered Pārsvastha." (434)
"Pāsa and Bandhana are both synonymous. All the causes of Bandhana are Pāsa. Those who are in them are Pārsvastha, this is another synonym (one meaning) of Pārsvastha." (4343)
"There are two types of Pārsvastha: 1. Desha-Pārsvastha, 2. Sarva-Pārsvastha."
"Desha-Pārsvastha desires in Shayya-tara Kuladi. There are three options for Sarva-Pārsvastha."
"In the practice of Darshan, Jnana, and Charitra, those who are lazy, i.e., do not exert themselves in their practice and indulge in their excesses and misconduct, are Sarva-Pārsvastha." (4342)
"That Sarva-Pārsvastha does not engage in Sūtra-Paurushi, Artha-Paurushi, and continues to indulge in excesses and doubts of Samyak-Darshan, desires, etc. He does not prevent the excesses of Samyak-Charitra. Therefore, he is Sarva-Pārsvastha."

## Fourth Uddeshak

[111 Gatha - Pasattha Ahachanda, Kusil Osannameva Sansatte.
Piyadhammo Piyadhammasuk Cheva Inamo Tu Sansatto || 4350 || One who becomes like Pasattha, Ahachanda, Kusil and Osanna, and becomes a Piyadharmi while staying with a Piyadharmi, such a person is called "Sansakt".

Gatha - Panchasavapavatto, Jo Khalu Tihim Garavehi Padibbadho.
Itthi-Gihi Sankiliṭṭho, Sansatto So Ya Nayavvo || 4351 || One who is involved in the five Asravas like violence, etc. is bound to the three Gaus - Riddhi, Rasa, and Sata. He is attached to women, meaning he is their servant. He is attached to householders, meaning he is involved in the happiness and sorrow related to the family, animals, etc. of the householder, either directly or indirectly. Such a person who becomes whatever he wants is called "Sansakt".

Chani - "Ahva - Sansatto Anegaruvi Natavat Elakavat.
Jaha Nado Pattvassa Anegani Ruvani Kareti, Uranago Va Jaha Halidaraagena Ratto, Dhovium Puno Guligagerugadiraagena Rajjate Evam Puno Vi Dhovium Annonnan Rajjati Evam Elagadivat Bahuruvi.
Bhavartha - One who can take on many forms like an actor and many colors like a sheep, and can also leave them, such a person with a chameleon-like nature is called "Sansakt".

5. Nitiya - One who stays in the same area continuously, violating the limits of Masakalp and Chaturmasik Kalp, is called "Kalatikrant-Nityak". And one who completes Masakalp and Chaturmasik Kalp and then returns to the same area after spending double the time elsewhere is called "Upasthananityak". One who practices the Upasthan Kriya and Kalatikrant Kriya mentioned in Pracha. Shru. 2 A. 2, U. 2 is called "Nityak" or "Nitiya". Or one who stays in one place without any reason and does not travel is called Nityak. For a detailed explanation, the commentator has referred to the "Nitiyavas" sutra of the second Uddeshak.

The order of these 10 sutras is different in different manuscripts. But after observing the Bhashya Churni, the above order seems to be correct. For example, the Gatha "Pasatthosannanam, Kusil Sansatt Nitiyavasiinam.
Je Bhikkhu Sanghadam, Dijja Ahva Padicchhejjja ||" 1828 || This is the first Bhashya Gatha of these ten sutras. In this and the previous Sutrasparshi Chani, both have the same order of sutras, and the same order is also in Bhashya Gatha 1830.

In the original text with Churni and in "Nisihajzhayana" edited by the Terapanthi Mahasabha, the sutras of "Sansattassa" are placed after "Nitiyassa". The reasons for this are not explained there. 

Page #212:
---------------------------
## 112]

The Nishītha Sūtra has been lost. However, the commentary and explanation of these Sūtras accept the above order. Still, in all publications of Nishītha, the Sūtras of "Sansattass" are after "Nitiyass". This is considered a mistake that has been passed down through tradition, and the order as per the commentary has been accepted.

While explaining Pasatthā etc., the mention of all the tendencies contrary to restraint, if consumed as an exception due to special circumstances, or for the sake of a song, or in accordance with the Shraddha Prarūpaṇā Āgama, and if they are free from that exceptional situation, and if there is a desire to reach pure restraint by performing atonement, then they are not called Pasatthā etc. But they are called Pratisevī Nigrantha.

Those who engage in all these corrupt tendencies are called 'Pasatthā' etc. due to the lack of pure conduct, not being vigilant towards restraint, consuming faults without reason, having a free-flowing mind, not being faithful to the conduct mentioned in the Āgama, continuing prohibited tendencies, and not having the goal of improving tendencies and accepting atonement.

These Pasatthā etc. can have their own independent Gachchha, or they can be alone. Even while staying in the Udyata Viharī Gachchha, some monks or a monk can become Pasatthā etc. due to individual faults, and even in the Gachchha of Pasatthā etc., some can be pure-conduct. The true judgment can only be made by one's own soul or by the omniscient and all-seeing.

Knowing these characteristics of Pasatthā etc., those who practice restraint should be careful of corrupt tendencies.

[Nishīthasūtra]
60. A monk who accepts food with a hand smeared with alum powder, or approves of someone who does so.
61. A monk who accepts food with a hand smeared with the peel of a green plant, straw, etc., or approves of someone who does so.
62. A monk who accepts food with a hand smeared with the powder of a green plant, or approves of someone who does so.
63. A monk who accepts food with an unsoiled, rough hand, or approves of someone who does so. (He receives a minor monthly atonement.)

**Discussion:**
These atonements are mentioned in relation to the violation of the Apkāya in Sūtra 49, the violation of the Pṛthvīkāya in Sūtras 50-60, and the violation of the Vanaspatikāya in Sūtras 61-62. Therefore, all these substances are considered to be sentient in this context. If, due to any particular use, these substances become non-sentient by becoming weapons, and the hands become soiled by them, then there is no atonement for accepting food with those hands. For example, hands can become wet from hot water ("udaullang"). Salt can sometimes become non-sentient, etc. This should be understood in the same way everywhere.

The atonement mentioned in Sūtra 63 is in relation to the Pāścātkarma. If the food is such that there is no Pāścātkarma defect, or if the giver is discerning and does not cause a Pāścātkarma defect, then there is no atonement for accepting alms with unsoiled hands, etc. In Daśavai-a. 5 u. 1 gā. 35, it is said: "Pachchākammṁ jahi bhave" - meaning that a monk should not accept food that is given with a Pāścātkarma defect.

In Prācā. śr. 2 a. 1 u. 11, the first Piṇḍaiṣaṇā, Abhigṛha, is mentioned. A monk who observes this Abhigṛha accepts alms only with unsoiled hands, etc., not with soiled hands, etc. A monk who observes this vow can accept both smeared and un-smeared food, because the fourth Piṇḍaiṣaṇā (vow), called "Alepā," is mentioned as accepting only un-smeared (rough) food. Therefore, it is understood that this atonement for unsoiled hands is in relation to the appropriate context, as per the Āgama.

**Word meanings:**
1. "Maṭṭiyā" - ordinary soil - smooth soil, black soil, red soil, etc., which is used for building raw houses, cleaning utensils, making pots, etc.
2. "Ūs" - on ordinary land, i.e., barren land, salt accumulates, which is called salt or "pāṁśu khār". "Ūṣaḥ-pāṁśu kṣāraḥ". Daśavai. Cūṇi and Ṭīkā.
3. "Maṇosil" - Maenaśil - a type of hard yellow soil.
4. "Geruy" - hard red soil.
5. "Vaṇiy" - yellow soil - "Jeṇa suvaṇṇṁ vaṇijjati".
6. "Seḍiy" - white soil - khadīyā soil.

## Fourth Uddeshaka

[115 7. "Soratthiya" - Alum - "Soratthiya Tuvaria Jie Suvannakara Uppam Karenti Suvannas Piḍam". 8. Ukkuṭṭha - "Sachitta Vanassa Icuṇṇo-Prokkuṭṭho Bhaṇṇati" In Prakrit language, there are many alternatives, therefore - 'Ukkaṭṭha, Ukkiṭṭha-Ukkuṭṭha' all three are pure and 'Seḍhiya Seḍiya' both are pure. Both are found in the Churni.

These 15 sutras contain the rules of atonement, which are mentioned in Pracharang Shru. 2, A 1, U. 6 and Dashakaliak A. 5, U. 1. There are two verses on this topic in the Dashakaliak Sutra, which mention 16 types of hands or other things being contaminated. The word "Piṭṭha" which comes after "Soratthiya" is merely an adjective for all the hard earths mentioned before "Soratthiya". Because the hands can only be contaminated by the powder of those hard earths. Therefore, this word is used in the verse after the words related to earth are finished, but it is interpreted as 17 types of contaminated hands etc. by considering it as an independent word. That logic is not sound, but only a misconception.

_"Agastya Churni and Jinadasagani's Churni interpret the word "Piṭṭha" as independent, which leads to the following interpretation:
"Uncooked dough (flour) cooked on a low flame becomes unmindful (achitta) in one prahar, and cooked on a high flame becomes quickly unmindful.

Here, the dough (flour of grains) is considered mindful before and after being placed on fire, which is not appropriate.
Rice is considered unmindful, and other grains are one-bodied, they remain mindful for hours even after being ground into flour, this explanation is also given because of considering the word "Piṭṭha" separately.

During the time of Gochari, hands filled with flour at home can be of two types: 1. While sifting the flour or taking it from the container to the plate, 2. While grinding the grains.
Taking Gochari from the one who grinds the grains is prohibited, and considering it mindful until the time of sifting is not appropriate. Therefore, by considering the word "Piṭṭha" as an adjective for the earth-bodied words mentioned in the sutras, and interpreting it as hands etc. contaminated by their powder, both the original text and meaning are consistent.

There are 16 words on this topic in the Dashakaliak Sutra. Here, their atonement is mentioned in 14 sutras. The atonement of "Sasiniḍḍha" is included in "Udaulla" and the atonement of "Sasarakkha" is included in "Maṭṭiyasansatṭa". Therefore, there are only 14 sutras, and one sutra "Asansatṭha" makes a total of 15 sutras. The order of these sutras is clear from the commentary verse.

The Churnikar has only interpreted the meaning of some words. Commentary verse - "Udaulla, Maṭṭiya Va, Usagate Cheva Hoti Bodhavve.
Haritale Hingulae, Maṇosila Anjane Lone || 1848 ||"

##  [116]
[Nishith Sutra]
Geruy vanniya sediya, soratthiya pitth kukkusakaye ya.
Ukkatthamasansthe, yave anupuve. || 1849 || Here, Nishith Churnikar has also interpreted the word "pitth" as independent, explaining it as "tandulapidhen pram asatthovahatam". This is the same meaning that is used in the available translations.
If "tandula" is interpreted as dry rice, then it is inanimate. And if it is interpreted as green rice, then there is a separate sutra for it, "ukkutth", which Churnikar himself explains as "sachittavansasai chunno okuttho bhannati". This includes all chopped green plants, chutneys, etc.
There are some differences between the original text of Nishith, the commentary, the Churni, and the Dashavaikalik. In many copies, the word "soratthiya" is not present, but other words like "kantav, lodh, kandamul, singaver, pupfhag" have been added. Also, phrases like "evam ekkaavinsam hattha bhaniyaavva", "egavisaabheena hatthena", etc. have been added, and in some copies, the number 23 has also been added.
Here, two words are used in relation to plants:
1. Crushed, ground, powdered, and chutney of plants.
2. Peels, husks, etc. of plants.
These can come into contact with hands, etc., and they include all types of plants. Therefore, there is no need for separate sutras for lodhra, kand, mul, singaver, and pupfhag. These words are not authenticated by the commentary, Churni, or Dashavaikalik. The word "kantav" is unknown. Therefore, these five words and the 21 hattha, etc. phrases were added much later, as there is no ancient basis for them.
##  Penance for performing acts on another's body
64. Je bhikkhu annamannas pae amajjejj va pamajjejj va, amajjantm va pamajjantm va saijjai. Evam taiyauddesagamenam neyaavvam jaav je bhikkhu gaamanugaman duijjamanne annamannas sisaduvvariyam karei, karentm va saijjai.
64. A monk who performs "amarjan" on another's feet once or many times, or approves of someone doing it, or who covers another's head while traveling from village to village, or approves of someone doing it, incurs a minor monthly penance.
##  Discussion
These are a total of 54 sutras. Penance is incurred according to these sutras when performing acts on another's body without a necessary reason, only out of devotion or curiosity. In the third uddeśaka, penance is mentioned for performing these acts oneself, and here, penance is mentioned for monks performing these acts on each other. With this distinction, we should understand that there are 54 sutras here as well, and their meaning and discussion should be understood in the same way. 

Page #217:
---------------------------
## Fourth Uddesaka

[117 The Churnikara has indicated here the number 41 sutras, which is as follows...
"Ityadi ekkatali-sam suttam uccareyavva jav annam-annass sisad-uvariyam karei ity-adi arthah purvavat. Gatha-pad-adi tu pammajjan, sisad-uvar-adi jo gamo tat-ie.
Annon-nass tu karane so cev gamo chaut-thammi || 1855 ||
This is explained by the third Uddesaka. Churni. Even though there is no instruction to reduce any sutra in this commentary, the reason for mentioning the number 41 sutras in the Churni is that in the third Uddesaka, for 26 sutras, the number 26 has been mentioned, but the number of padas is 13. It is likely that the same number of padas has been counted here as the number of sutras. As a result, 13 is subtracted from 54, resulting in 41 sutras. Therefore, even though the original text of the above 54 sutras is in this Uddesaka, there is no contradiction in the number 41 mentioned by the Churnikara. It is only a difference in interpretation.
Sutras 64 to 117, which deal with the mutual body-actions, are similar to the third Uddesaka. Their table is as follows:
Number Foot-actions Body-actions Wound-treatment Gandamala etc. surgical treatment Worm removal
Nail cutting 90 to 95
Hair-actions 96 to 98
Tooth-actions 99 to 104

## Fourth Uddeshak

[119-126. A monk who, after defecating, goes too far to perform ablution or approves of someone who does so.
127. A monk who, after defecating, performs ablution more than three times or approves of someone who does so. (He incurs a minor monthly penance.)]

**Discussion:** The essence of these ten sutras is that one should mark out three places for defecation during the evening. The ground for sitting should be at least one handspan long and wide. One should follow the procedure of looking around, etc. After defecation, one should clean the anus with a piece of cloth. Then, one should move a little distance away and purify oneself with water.

The mention of wiping and ablution, etc., is related to great ethics. Sometimes there is a great obstacle of doubt. Therefore, marking out three places is also suitable for that.

After urinating, it is not necessary to wipe or perform ablution, and often one has to urinate more than three times. Therefore, it is appropriate to understand the meaning of these ten sutras primarily in relation to defecation.

1. "Khuddaga" - "Whatever is less than a handspan in length and width is called khuddaga." In the detailed explanation of the gatha, whatever is less than a handspan in length and width is called "khuddaga."
A place that is four angulas deep and less than a handspan in length and width is called "jaghannya vistirna."

2. "Sanuppae" - "Sanuppae is the name of the fourth part of the fourth part of the human body." After finishing one's studies, one should mark out the sleeping place and the place for defecation and urination during the evening time of non-study.

_One can only know about the burrows of animals, insects, etc., pits, uneven ground, etc., by marking out the place. By marking out the place, one can avoid many faults. But if one does not mark out the place, then if one suddenly has to defecate, it is possible to get sick or even die.

3. "Tao" - The reason for marking out three places is that if one looks at only one place, and someone else defecates there or an animal sits there, then there is a possibility of many faults. Therefore, one should mark out three places.

4. "Avihie" - The procedure is to mark out or clean the place where one will sit before defecating, to look around to see if anyone is nearby, to defecate thoughtfully in a place that dries quickly, and not to defecate in the sun if there are worms in the feces. Doing the opposite of this is called "pravidhi." 

Page #220:
---------------------------
[120]
The commentary on the Nishīth Sūtra states that after saying "Aṇujāṇaha Jassuggahoṁ," one should perform a parathnā (prayer) to avoid the disturbance of gods and demons. During the day, one should face north, and at night, one should face south. One should also avoid turning one's back towards the wind, a settlement, or the sun. 
5. "Puṁchaī" - After wiping the anus with a cloth, one can achieve purity by performing āchaman (ritual rinsing) with a little water. A worn-out cloth is often found with a sādhū (holy person). The reason for prohibiting wiping with wood, etc., is to avoid any kind of injury to the delicate area. Wiping with a finger or hand does not ensure cleanliness and leaves a lingering odor, hence the prescribed atonement for using them.
6. 'Āchaman' - The sūtra states that "Ucchare Vosīrijjāmāne Avassan Pāsaṇam Bhavatī" (Urine is always present during excretion). Therefore, the sūtra mentions urine along with feces. However, after excreting feces, one should perform āchaman (washing) of the anus, not the urinary organ. Wiping the anus with a piece of cloth does not ensure complete purity and leaves a lingering impurity. Therefore, āchaman is also necessary. Failure to perform āchaman results in the prescribed atonement mentioned in the sūtra.
Performing āchaman directly over the excreted matter increases wetness, which takes longer to dry, increasing the possibility of contamination. Therefore, it is appropriate to perform āchaman at a distance. Performing āchaman in the same place increases the risk of feces getting on the hands. Performing purification too far away can lead to people believing that āchaman is not being performed.
Nāvāpūraṇam - "Nāva" refers to a hand-sized cup of water, which should be used for purification. The verse states, "Gāthā-Uccārāmāyarittā, Pareṇ Tiṇhaṁ Tu Nāvāpūraṇam."
Those who perform āchaman with three nāvāpūraṇam (handfuls of water) receive the benefits of āṇamā (spiritual merit) and other benefits.
[1880]
Using more than three nāvāpūraṇam (handfuls of water) leads to the following disadvantages:
Uccholaṇā (excessive washing) leads to a difficult path to liberation, and other disadvantages arise from it. It causes harm to insects and other creatures, and small creatures, leaves, flowers, and fruits fall into the water.
[1881]
The commentary on the tenth chapter of the fourth section states that a monk who performs excessive washing and cleansing has a difficult path to liberation. Excessive washing leads to many other disadvantages. The excessive flow of water causes pain to insects and other creatures. When water fills a pit, it traps small creatures, and leaves, flowers, and fruits fall into it.
Excessive washing leads to the defilement of restraint.
Nāvāpūraka - A hand-sized cup of water, similar in size to a nāva (boat), is called a nāvāpūraka. After excreting feces and urine, one should purify the anus with three nāvāpūraka.

## Fourth Uddeshak

[121]
A monk who performs purification by more than three name-givers after discarding excrement is liable to the offenses of violating the commands of the Vitaraga, etc.
At the end of the third Uddeshak, there is a statement about the lands suitable and unsuitable for discarding excrement and urine. In the absence of a suitable place, the method of discarding excrement in one's own vessel at one's own place during the day and night has been instructed.
In these last 10 sutras of this fourth Uddeshak, the subject of utterance, excretion, and cleansing has been discussed. However, here, while giving information about the method of discarding excrement only by going to a suitable place, penance has been mentioned.

Penance for going with a Pariharic for begging
128. If a monk who is not a Pariharic says to a Pariharic, "O Arya! Come, you and I will go together and take prasna, drink, food, or something tasty, and after that, we will eat and drink separately," whoever says this or approves of the one who says it, upon consuming the places of offense mentioned in the above 128 sutras, incurs a minor monthly penance.

Discussion - The words Pariharic and Apariharic are used in Uddeshak 2, Sutra 40. There, their meaning is respectively, one who does not incur offense and one who incurs offense.
But here, their meaning is respectively, a monk who observes penance, whose food is separate, and a pure monk who is free from penance.

Churni - "The one who performs penance is Apariharic, the one who does not perform penance is Pariharic, from one month to six months."

The monk who performs penance is called "Pariharic," he is avoided by all the monks of the Gachchha except the Acharya, only the Acharya interacts with him, other monks of the Gachchha cannot interact with him in any way, thus he is to be avoided by the Gachchha, hence he is called Pariharic.

Question - Who can perform this penance?
Answer - 1. One who is strong and well-built, 2. One who is patient, 3. One who is knowledgeable about the scriptures, 4. One who is capable.
Even if the first three qualities are present, if one is a child, old, or sick, then he is considered incapable. Therefore, only a young and healthy person should be considered capable.

Question - What kind of penance does he perform?
Answer - He performs a penance of one month to six months. 

Page #222:
---------------------------
[122]
Question - What austerity does he perform?
Answer - He performs at least an ekantar fast and eats ayambil on the day of parana.
Question - In this sutra, it is said that there is a penance for going on a pilgrimage with him, and there are also penances for other types of behavior with him?
[Nishīthasūtra
Answer - There is a laghumasik penance for performing eight actions with him, the eighth being going on a pilgrimage with him. Therefore, it should be understood that the previous seven actions are also included with him. In addition to these, there are two more actions for which there is a guru-masik penance.
Question - What are those ten actions?
Answer - 1. Talking to each other.
2. Asking about the meaning of the sutras.
4. Getting up, sitting down, etc. together.
3. Listening to and reciting memorized knowledge such as swadhyay. 5. Vandan-behavior.
7. Doing work such as copying.
9. Giving and taking food.
Question - If he wants to say something, ask something, or criticize something, to whom should he (the pariharik) sadhu go?
6. Giving and taking utensils, etc. 8. Making a sanghada for both and going on a pilgrimage, etc.
10. Sitting in one mandala and performing prahar, i.e., eating together.
Answer - If he has to do anything, he should do it with the permission of the acharya, criticize him, ask him questions, and tell him about his food. If he is in distress or has a disease, etc., he should also tell the acharya. Another sadhu cannot go to him, speak to him, or ask him questions, etc.
Question - If someone sees him in a sick state, who should he inform?
Answer - If he is in unbearable pain at any time in the upashraya, he should tell the acharya himself. If he is unable to tell the acharya due to unbearable pain, another sadhu should go and inform the acharya about his pain. Later, the acharya should appoint someone to serve him.

Question - If the bhikshu who has gone on a pilgrimage, etc., falls somewhere on the way, is it necessary to take the acharya's permission to serve him?
Answer - No, in such a situation, any sadhu can serve him. After bringing him to the place, the acharya is informed and other actions such as criticism are performed, and he is also served until he is healthy. He should do as much work as he can do himself. And the work that he cannot do, another sadhu should do according to the acharya's instructions.
Question - Why is he treated in this way? If someone serves him always, is there any fault? 

Page #223:
---------------------------
[Fourth Uddeshak]
[123
Answer- This solution is explained by an example.
Just as an animal is taken out of the village to graze when it is able to graze on its own. If it is weak, the shepherd brings grass etc. to it at home. Similarly, one should understand in relation to the service of the Pariharic.
Question- Why is such severe penance and harsh treatment done to him?
Answer- The one who commits a sin is given the same penance. Parihar penance is given for the purification of the fault and the purification of the self, which is accepted voluntarily. This will also remind or frighten other monks that such a penance is done for such a fault. In addition, doing this penance also leads to the destruction of karma.
Question- The penance of criticism is done in solitude, so how can there be clear information. So that other monks become afraid and beware of such faults?
Answer- Before establishing this penance bearing form, the Shraman community is informed collectively and complete information about the sin is given, after giving full explanation, he is withdrawn for self-purification by stopping dealing with him. He is counted under the Acharya's
subordination and obedience. One day before the penance bearing, the Acharya himself goes with him and gives him (Manojnya-Vigaya-Yukt) food.
In this way, this penance is given by informing the fourfold community with respect and this penance is started for the sake of this penance. The Shraman community is given complete information about the penance of that Pariharic, what kind of behavior can be done in what circumstances and when.
_ Question- If the enthusiasm for doing penance decreases due to not taking Vigaya even in Parana, then is it necessary to do that penance even without desire?
Answer- The Acharya can do as appropriate after knowing the whole situation. It is the responsibility of the Acharya to encourage him to do penance, to do his Sarana, Varana or to do penance. If they deem it necessary, they can also give permission for Vigaya and they also go with him to give food for special satisfaction.
Question- Is such penance done for all small and big faults?
Answer- No, in the penance of faults related to Uttar Guna and in the penance of heinous, medium penance related to Mula Guna, only penance penance is given. In the penance of the consumption of excellent faults related to Mula Guna, monthly or up to six months "Parihar penance" is given. It is also given to the worthy. If he is not worthy, ordinary penance is given, and ordinary penance is given to the Sadhvos. Parihar penance is not given. is given.
Question- Is this penance greater than the penance of the hole? 

Page #224:
---------------------------
[124]
[Nishīth Sūtra]
Answer- No, Chhed Prāyaśchitta is given when someone repeatedly commits an immoral act, when they remain in the sin for a long time, when they are criticized by the public, or when they lack the strength to perform penance. This is a type of Prāyaśchitta different from Tapa.
Chhed Prāyaśchitta can be given for a minimum of one day and a maximum of six months. If more Prāyaśchitta is required, then the fifth "Mūla" (new initiation) Prāyaśchitta is given. However, there is no provision for giving more than six months of Prāyaśchitta for Tapa, Parihāra Tapa, or Dīkshāchhed.
Question- Is anyone currently given Prāyaśchitta by this method?
Answer- Due to the lack of specific Sanhanan etc., currently, Prāyaśchitta of ordinary Tapa is given, and further Chhed and Mūla (new initiation) Prāyaśchitta is also given, but the said Parihāra Tapa Prāyaśchitta is not given.
For hundreds of years after Vīra Nirvāṇa, Parihāra Tapa Prāyaśchitta was given. In the original text of Chhed Sūtras, there are many provisions related to Parihārik Sadhus in many places, and detailed descriptions are also found in the Bhāṣya texts.
If there is a possibility of Parihārik and Aparihārik appearing together, then one should stop and the other should be separated.
The Sūtra states that Prāyaśchitta is for Aparihārik. If Parihārik also does this, then he also receives Prāyaśchitta, this should also be understood.

'Saccitta rukkhamuulensi' - "Jassa saccitta rukkassa hatthi-pay-pamanno pehulleṇ khando tassa savvato jaav rayanippamaṇā tāv saccittabhūmi." - Churni
If the trunk of a tree is as thick as an elephant's foot, then the ground around it for a distance of one hand is considered saccitta. If the trunk is thicker, then the ground near it is considered saccitta in proportion to its thickness. Therefore, standing, sitting, or lying down in such a place would violate the earth-body, and touching the trunk of the tree carelessly would violate the plant-body.
'Thaṇam-sejj-ṇisihiyam' "Thaṇam-kaussaggo, vasahi nimittan sejjā, visam-thaṇ nimittanṇisihiyā." - Churni

## 63
**Fifth Uddeshak**

[129 "Anunna"-"Thiribhuyas Anunna"- After firmly and purely memorizing, giving permission to teach others. —Ni. Chuni.
The other meanings of Uddeshak, Samuddeshak and Anunna are also given in the Haribhadraiya Tika of the Anuyoagdwar Sutra, as follows:
1. Uddeshak- Giving permission to read the Sutra. 2. Samuddeshak- Giving permission to stabilize. 3. Anunna- Giving permission to teach others. "Vayana" giving the reading of the Sutra meaning. "Padichhana" accepting the reading of the Sutra meaning.
Here, the prohibition and atonement for staying near the tree-trunk automatically proves the prohibition and atonement for all other actions. Still, the prohibition and atonement for doing many actions and doing Swadhyaya etc. is said through eleven Sutras, expecting a detailed style. The atonement for getting a sheet stitched from a householder
12. Je Bhikkhu Appano Sanghadi Annautthiyenam Va, Garathien Va Sivvavei, Sivvavetam Va Saizzaj.
12. The monk who gets his sheet stitched by a non-Jain or a householder, or approves of the one who gets it stitched.
_Vivechan- Jai Nikkarane Appana Sivveti, Karane Va Annautthiya-Garathiyehi Sivvavei Tassa Masalhum.'  1921 Chuni.
According to the discussion of the first Uddeshak Sutra eleven, one should understand here that there are eight types of householders, four being Swatithik and four being Paratithik.
If a long and wide cloth is not available as per need, or if it is torn due to some reason before becoming 'Analam, Athiram Adharaniy', then it is necessary to stitch it. In that case, one should stitch it themselves or get it stitched by another monk. If there is no monk who can stitch, then one can get it stitched by a nun. There is no atonement for this, but if it is stitched by a householder, then there is a Laghumasik atonement. The atonement for making long strings of the sheet
13. Je Bhikkhu Appano Sanghadiye Doh-Suttain Karei, Karentam Va Saizzaj.
13. The monk who ties long strings to his sheet or approves of the one who ties them. (He gets Laghumasik atonement.)
Vivechan- If the sheet or Gati is short in length and it is necessary to tie strings, then strings can be tied at four or, preferably, six places, which makes one, two or, preferably, three knots. 

Page #230:
---------------------------
##  [130]
[Nishith Sutra]
"Je te sanghaadibandhan suttha te dihaa na kaayavvaa" - The binding thread should be no longer than four angulas (finger widths) after tying the knots.  This is because a longer thread is difficult to handle, leading to discomfort, and incurs the faults of "sammadda" and "anegaruavadhrnaa" in the scriptural record. It also becomes a source of ridicule for those with limited intelligence or curious minds. 
Alternatively, if the threads become tangled, it takes time to untangle them, leading to a loss of the sutra's meaning.
Therefore, if necessary, "chaurangulppamaanam, tamhaa sanghaadi-suttagam kujjaa" - a binding thread of four angulas should be made. Making it larger incurs penance. 

## Penance for Eating Leaves
[14] Je bhikku piumand-palasayam vaa, padol-palasayam vaa, billpalasayam vaa, meodag-viyaden vaa usinodag-viyaden vaa sanphaaniy-sanphaaniy ahareï, aharantan vaa saïjjaï.
[14] A monk who eats neem leaves, padol-parval leaves, bilva leaves, or leaves that have been repeatedly dipped in cold or hot water, or approves of such eating, incurs a minor monthly penance.

## Explanation
If these dry leaves, as mentioned in the sutra, are needed for medicinal purposes, then one should search for them at a householder's home, where they are dried and cleaned for personal use.
If a monk washes these leaves himself and throws away the water, it is considered a violation of life and an increase in carelessness, leading to penance.
It should be understood that this also includes washing other medicinal leaves, flowers, etc.
Here, the meaning of "padol" is not explained in the Churni or Bhashya. In other sources like Kosha, it is interpreted as a specific type of creeper and "parval leaves".

## Penance for Using a Cloth to Wipe Feet
[15] Je bhikku paadihaariyam paayapuchhanam jaïtta "tamev rani paccappini'ssamitti" sue paccappini'ï paccappini'ntam vaa saïjjaï.
[16] Je bhikku paadihaariyam paayapuchhanam jaïtta "sue paccappini'ssami" tti tamev rayani paccappini'ï, paccappini'ntam vaa saïjjaï.
[17] Je bhikku saagariy-santiyam paayapuchhanam jaïtta "tamev rani paccappini'ssami" tti sue paccappini'ï, paccappini'ntam vaa saïjjaï.

[15] A monk who uses a cloth to wipe his feet and says, "I will use this cloth to wipe my feet," or approves of such use, incurs a minor monthly penance.
[16] A monk who uses a cloth to wipe his feet and says, "I will use this cloth to wipe my feet," or approves of such use, incurs a minor monthly penance.
[17] A monk who uses a cloth to wipe his feet and says, "I will use this cloth to wipe my feet," or approves of such use, incurs a minor monthly penance.

## Fifth Uddeshak

**[131 18. A monk who, having requested a householder's *Saagariy-Santiy* (foot-cloth), says "I will return it today," but returns it the next day, or approves of the return being made the next day, incurs a *Rani* (minor) *PaccAppini* (penance).**

**15. A monk who, having requested a householder's foot-cloth, says "I will return it tomorrow," but returns it the same day, or approves of the return being made the same day, incurs a *Rani* (minor) *PaccAppini* (penance).**

**16. A monk who, having requested a *Shayatar's* (layman's) foot-cloth, says "I will return it today," but returns it tomorrow, or approves of the return being made tomorrow, incurs a *Rani* (minor) *PaccAppini* (penance).**

**17. A monk who, having requested a *Shayatar's* (layman's) foot-cloth, says "I will return it tomorrow," but returns it the same day, or approves of the return being made the same day, incurs a *Rani* (minor) *PaccAppini* (penance).**

**(He incurs a *Laghumaasik* (monthly) *Praayashchitt* (penance).)**

**Discussion:** The second *Uddeshak* mentions the *Praayashchitt* (penance) for keeping a foot-cloth with a wooden stick. Here, the *Praayashchitt* (penance) is mentioned for returning a householder's or a *Shayatar's* foot-cloth, which was taken for one or two days, before or after the promised time.

In a specific situation related to the place and time, a foot-cloth for wiping feet can be taken from a householder or a *Shayatar* as a *Praatihaarik* (temporary possession). Here, the *Praayashchitt* (penance) is not mentioned for taking a *Praatihaarik* foot-cloth, but for the lack of discretion in language.

A monk keeps a piece of cloth as a 'foot-cloth', perhaps also keeps a foot-cloth with a wooden stick when necessary, and sometimes, in special circumstances, takes a householder's or a *Shayatar's* foot-cloth for one or two days. This seems to be indicated by these sutras.

**Penance for returnable 'stick' etc.**

**19. A monk who, having requested a *Padihaariy* (returnable) stick, a *Latthi* (staff), an *Avlehaniy* (writing implement), or a *VeNuSuI* (bamboo needle), says "I will return it today," but returns it tomorrow, or approves of the return being made tomorrow, incurs a *Rani* (minor) *PaccAppini* (penance).**

**20. A monk who, having requested a *Padihaariy* (returnable) stick, a *Latthi* (staff), an *Avlehaniy* (writing implement), or a *VeNuSuI* (bamboo needle), says "I will return it today," but returns it the same day, or approves of the return being made the same day, incurs a *Rani* (minor) *PaccAppini* (penance).**

**21. A monk who, having requested a *Saagariy-Santiy* (foot-cloth), a stick, a *Latthi* (staff), an *Avlehaniy* (writing implement), or a *VeNuSuI* (bamboo needle), says "I will return it today," but returns it tomorrow, or approves of the return being made tomorrow, incurs a *Rani* (minor) *PaccAppini* (penance).**

**22. A monk who, having requested a *Saagariy-Santiy* (foot-cloth), a stick, a *Latthi* (staff), an *Avlehaniy* (writing implement), or a *VeNuSuI* (bamboo needle), says "I will return it today," but returns it the same day, or approves of the return being made the same day, incurs a *Rani* (minor) *PaccAppini* (penance).**

**19. A monk who, having requested a stick, a staff, a writing implement, or a bamboo needle from a householder, says "I will return it today," but returns it tomorrow, or approves of the return being made tomorrow, incurs a *Rani* (minor) *PaccAppini* (penance).** 

Page #232:
---------------------------
##  [Nishith Sutra]

**132]**

**20.** A monk who requests a staff, stick, writing implement, or bamboo needle from a householder, saying "I will return it tomorrow," and returns it today or approves of the return, 
**21.** A monk who requests a staff, stick, writing implement, or bamboo needle from a householder, saying "I will return it today," and returns it tomorrow or approves of the return, 
**22.** A monk who requests a staff, stick, writing implement, or bamboo needle from a householder, saying "I will return it tomorrow," and returns it today or approves of the return, (incurs a minor monthly atonement).

**Discussion:** A staff, stick, etc. are also objects that can be accepted as a gift. These can also be accepted from a householder or another person with the promise of returning them. They can be accepted for a day or two, or for a longer period. Here, the atonement is for the lack of discernment in language.

**Atonement related to returning bedding materials:**

**23.** A monk who, having returned the bedding materials of another householder or a householder, uses them again without asking permission, or approves of their use, (incurs a minor monthly atonement).

**Discussion:** The term "Padihariyam" is used for bedding materials brought from elsewhere, and the term "Sagariy-Santiyam" is used for bedding materials, etc., that are kept at the place of stay.

If a monk does not need the bedding materials, he should hand them over to the householder at the shelter. Later, if he needs them again, he must ask the householder's permission. If he takes them without asking permission again, he incurs atonement according to this sutra.

The bedding materials of a householder can be left in his house, but bedding materials brought from another householder's house can also be left in the shelter for a short time. This is implied by this atonement sutra and the Vyavahar Sutra Uddeshak 8. However, before going on a journey, they must be returned to their rightful place and handed over. This is stated in the Bahutkalp Uddeshak 3, and if they are not returned, atonement is incurred according to the Nishith Uddeshak 2.

**Atonement for spinning cotton:**

**24.** A monk who spins cotton from flax, wool, pond cotton, or amil cotton, or approves of it, 

Page #233:
---------------------------
## Fifth Uddesaka

[133, The Katakar makes or approves the making of the Dirgha Sutra. (He incurs the Laghumasik Pratikramana.)]

**Discussion:** "Doha suttam nama katta ti" - The meaning of Dirgha Sutra is Katana, i.e., spinning cotton with a "takli, charkha" etc.

**Bhaṣya Gāthā:** Sutatte palimanthō, uddāho jhusir doso sammho.
Hatthō vāghay sanchay, pasang āḍāṇ gamanam cha. || 1966 || This Gāthā contains a collection of the faults of spinning. Spinning is the work of a householder, doing it causes a monk to lose his holiness. It causes harm to mosquitoes and other living beings, excessive spinning causes fatigue in the hands and other parts of the body. Spinning can also lead to the tendency to weave.

There is also the possibility of collecting and other faults. Thus, this Gāthā describes self-harm and restraint-harm.

Therefore, a monk should not engage in spinning or other such activities. If he engages in such activities or approves of them, he incurs Pratikramana from this Sutra. The Pratikramana for making a colorful, attractive, and decorated staff is:

25. The monk who makes or approves the making of a staff made of wood, bamboo, or cane, which is decorated.

**27.** A monk who makes or approves of the making of a colored staff made of wood, bamboo, or cane.
**28.** A monk who carries or approves of the carrying of a colored staff made of wood, bamboo, or cane.
**29.** A monk who makes or approves of the making of a multi-colored staff made of wood, bamboo, or cane.
**30.** A monk who carries or approves of the carrying of a multi-colored staff made of wood, bamboo, or cane. (He incurs the minor monthly atonement.)

**Discussion:** "Staff" is an auxiliary accessory. This means that it can only be used by someone with a specific physical weakness, etc., but it is not generally considered appropriate for all monks.

Therefore, if a ready-made staff is available, it can be used. If not, the monk can make one himself from suitable wood, etc.

The following points must be kept in mind when making and carrying a staff:

1. The wood should not contain any living creatures, i.e., the wood, etc., should be completely devoid of life.
2. The wood, etc., should not be dyed any color other than its natural color.
3. It should not be made unusual with multiple attractive colors, craftsmanship, or paintings.

**Technical Terms:**

"Saccitta" - containing living beings.
"Citrakah" - one color.
"Vicitra" - multiple colors.

It is not forbidden to apply a coating to protect the staff. However, it is not appropriate to make or carry a staff with one or multiple colors for decoration or with craftsmanship.

Making or carrying a staff made of living wood is a clear violation of non-violence. All three types of staffs incur the minor monthly atonement.

**Note:** The commentary does not explain the three sutras containing the verb "paribhajayi" and there is no instruction regarding them. This is because auxiliary accessories are only used when necessary. Therefore, these three sutras are also not necessary. These sutras were not present in the original text of the copies from the time of the commentary and the commentary writer, and were added later. Therefore, these three sutras are not included in the original text here, and only six sutras are accepted and explained.

## Fifth Uddeshak
[135]
## Penitence for Entering Newly Established Villages, etc.
31. A monk who enters a newly established 1. village, 2. city, 3. Kheda, 4. Karbat, 5. Madamb, 6. Dronamukha, 7. Pattana, 8. Ashram, 9. Sannivesha, 10. Nigama, 11. Sambah, or 12. capital city, and partakes of food, drink, edibles, or savories, or approves of one who partakes of them, incurs a minor monthly penance.

**Explanation of the places mentioned in the Sutra:**

1. **Gama:** "A place where eighteen types of artisans reside" or "where there are no qualities like wisdom, etc."
2. **Nagaram:** "Where there is not even a single artisan."
3. **Khedam:** "A place surrounded by a wall of dust."
4. **Kabbadam:** "A small city, Karbart."
5. **Madambam:** "A place where there is no village, etc., within a radius of one and a half gavyutis in all directions."
6. **Pattanam:** "Pattana is of two types: Jalapattana and Sthalapattana." A place where goods are brought by water or land routes.
7. **Dronamukham:** A place where goods are received from both water and land routes.
8. **Nigama:** "Where merchants reside." A group of traders living together.
9. **Asamam:** A place where the residence of ascetics, etc., is prominent. A place where the first ascetics built their ashrams, and then other people came and settled.
10. **Sannivesam:** The meaning of the word "Sannivesha" is explained in Acharanga Sutra 1, Adhyaya 8, Uddeshak 6, Nisitha Uddeshak 12, and Rajendra Kosh. The explanation is based on the word "Nivesha" in Nisitha Uddeshak 5 and Brihatkalpa Bhashya. Since the explanation is the same everywhere, the word "Sannivesha" has been retained in the original text.
11. **Rayahani:** "Where the king resides."
12. **Sambah:** A place near a mountain where grains, etc., are collected and stored.
13. **Ghosa:** A settlement of cowherds.
14. **Ansiyam:** The third or fourth part of a village, etc., where one has gone to stay.
15. **Pudabheyana:** A settlement near a market place where goods are sold from various directions.
16. **Agara:** A place near where stones, metals, etc., are produced and extracted.

Brihat Bhashya, Bha. 2, p. 342.

[136]
This Sutra mentions 12 out of the 16 places like villages, etc. The place "Pragar" is mentioned in the next Sutra. Thus, a total of 13 places are mentioned here. The remaining 13th, 14th, and 15th places are mentioned in the Brihatkalpa Sutra Uddeshak? Sutra 6.
The Nishith Bhashya does not explicitly mention or explain these words. The Churnikar has explained them. The verses of the Brihatkalpa Bhashya explain these words. There are 16 words explained there, and the original text also has 16 words. The explanation (in the Bhashya) mentions one name more than the other. The name "Sankaro" is a little bit of a village, a hunting ground, and an ashram.
The original texts of different Sutras have different orders of these words. There are 16 names in many places and 12 names in many places. Of these, the numbers 13-14-15 are definitely less, and one of the three, Agar, Nigam, and Ashram, is less. The reason for this is unknown.
In the Bhashya and commentary of Brihatkalpa Uddeshak? Sutra 6, the order of "Rajdhani" is tenth, and the total number of names is 16. In the subsequent Sutras 7-8-9, the text "Gamansin va jav Rayhanisin va" is found to be the same in all copies.
If we want to have the same text everywhere, then considering the antiquity of the Brihatkalpa Bhashya and according to its text, and keeping the word "Rajdhani" at the end, if we accept 16 words, then there is no possibility of any contradiction. The order of these 16 should be as follows:
1. Gram 2. Nagar 3. Khed 4. Karbat 5. Madamb 6. Pattana 7. Agar 8. Dronamukha 9. Nigam 10. Ashram 11. Sannivesh 12. Sambadh 13. Ghosh 14. Anshika 15. Putbhadan 16. Rajdhani.
In the present Sutra, only 15 names are appropriate except "Agar", because there are many types of "Pagar" mentioned in the Sutra ahead.
There should be 16 words in the Vyavaharsutra, Brihatkalpa Sutra, Nishith Sutra, and Acharang, and the short text should have "Gamansin va jav Rayhanisin va" everywhere. In some places, the short text "Gamansin va jav Sannivesansin va" is also found. There should be uniformity in such short texts. The students of Agam should pay attention to this. This will eliminate the alternatives of different numbers.
"Navag-Nivesansin" - Sadhus and Sadhvis should not enter newly settled villages, etc., for some days. Because both auspicious and inauspicious omens are obstacles in the practice of Sadhus. In case of inauspicious omens, it can be a cause of hindrance for other Sadhus. Therefore, one should not go to stay in such places and should not even go for Gochari, etc. The atonement for entering a newly built mine
32. If a monk enters "Navag-Nivesansin", Ayagarsin va, Tambagarsin va, Tauyagarsin va, Sisagarsin va, Hirannagarsin va, Suvannagarsin va, Vairagarsin va, and eats food, drink, or takes something, he is guilty.

## Fifth Uddeshak

[137. A monk who, near a mine of 1. iron, 2. copper, 3. taru (iron ore), 4. lead, 5. silver, 6. gold, or 7. vajraratna (diamond), goes to a newly settled habitation and consumes food, drink, edibles, or savories, or approves of someone who does so, incurs a laghumasik pratyakshita (minor monthly penance).]

**Explanation:** Mines of iron, gold, etc., are of many types. People who work in those mines reside near them. One should not go to such newly settled habitations for gochari (walking for alms).

In the previous sutra, the penance for going to a newly settled village, etc., for gochari was mentioned. Because there, some people believe in omens and portents, and in mines, apart from omens and portents, some people may have doubts about profit and loss regarding the materials extracted from there, therefore, this sutra about penance is mentioned separately. Also, being near a mine, it is possible for earth-bodied beings to be harmed. Sometimes, an accusation of theft may also be made against the monk. Therefore, one should not go to these places for gochari, etc.

In many copies, the word "rayanagranshi" is found in excess. This has come due to a scribal error. Here, the mention of vajraratna includes all gems.

**Penance for making and playing a Veena**

33. A monk who makes or approves of someone who makes a veena from 1. mouth, 2. teeth, 3. proshtha (lip), 4. nose, 5. armpit, 6. hand, 7. nails, 8. leaves, 9. flowers, 10. fruits, 11. seeds, or 12. green grass, incurs a laghumasik pratyakshita.

34. A monk who plays a veena from the mouth to green grass, or approves of someone who does so, incurs a laghumasik pratyakshita.

35. A monk who produces or approves of someone who produces other similar unproduced sounds, incurs a laghumasik pratyakshita.

**Explanation:** Out of the above 12 types of veenas, 7 are related to the body, and the remaining 5 are related to plants. These veenas can be played naturally or by combining them with other materials. Curiosity, fickleness, or mental awareness are prominent in making and playing them, which is inappropriate for a monk. Making them requires distorting the body parts and cutting plants. 

Page #238:
---------------------------
[138]
The Nishīthasūtra is a musical instrument that causes harm to the self and to plants, and when played, it harms plants, air bodies, or both. It generates various distorted thoughts in the minds of those who hear and see it. This practice also tends to bewilder the self and others.

These actions are not suitable for a renunciant. Therefore, they are considered to require atonement. Although it is a minor monthly atonement, various types of atonement, such as minor, medium, and major, can be given according to the severity of the offense.

"Muhvīṇiyaṁ" should be understood as a vīṇā played with the throat.

The atonement for making different sounds with stones, glass, or any other object, or for playing musical instruments, should be understood from the above sūtra 35.

After the time of the commentary (vyākhyā), it has been observed in many copies that these three sūtras have sometimes become 25 or 24 sūtras in the original text. However, there is no such instruction in the commentary, chani, etc., therefore, it seems appropriate to keep three sūtras here instead of accepting 25 sūtras.

Atonement for entering a purposeful bed:
36. The monk who enters a purposeful (uddiṣṭa) bed, or approves of the one who enters.
37. The monk who enters a bed with a "pāhuḍiya" defect, or approves of the one who enters.
38. The monk who enters a bed with a "parikarma" defect, or approves of the one who enters. (He incurs a minor monthly atonement.)

Discussion:
1. The house built for a renunciant is called a "purposeful defect" bed.
2. The sixth defect in the sixteen defects of "pāhuḍiya" is called "pāhuḍiya". This same defect should be understood here for the bed. The construction of a house should be for the householder, but if the construction time is delayed or expedited, that same bed is called a "pāhuḍiya defect bed".
3. "Parikarman" - Cleaning, causing to be cleaned, covering, causing to be covered, making it airy, or closing it off for a renunciant in a house built for a householder. Making the door smaller or larger, 

Page #239:
---------------------------
## Fifth Uddeshak

[139] A bed is considered to have "parikarma dosha" if it is located where actions like leveling the ground, moving heavy objects, or transporting goods have been performed.
The Acharangasutra (Shru. 2, A. 2, U. 1) states that it is not appropriate for a monk to stay in a bed with the aforementioned parikarma dosha. However, if a householder has taken possession of the place after these parikarma actions have been performed by a sadhu, then it is appropriate for the sadhu to stay there.
Therefore, entering a bed with parikarma dosha before it is taken into use by a householder incurs the praayaschitta mentioned in the sutra. 1. "Uddeshik"

Javatayam uddeso, pasandanan bhawe samuddeso.
Samanaan tu aadeso, nigganthan samaadeso. || 2020 || 1. For all types of travelers, 2. For all types of pasandi (heretics), meaning those who have renounced the world from all sects, 3. For the five types of Shramanas like Shakyas, 4. For Jain sadhus, entering a bed built for any of these four types incurs a laghumaasik praayaschitta.

Acharangasutra (Shru. 2, A. 2, U. 1) states "Bahwe saman-mahan-atihi-kiwan-vanimae paganij paganij." 1. This is the sutra. The meaning of this sutra should be understood in the first and second alternatives as explained by the commentator. The third alternative should be understood in the "savadh kriya" mentioned in the Acharangasutra, and the fourth alternative should be understood in the "mahasavady" kriya.

2. "Pahud" - Apart from changing the time of building a house, doing other things before or after also leads to pahud dosha. This is explained in the commentary.

Viddhansan chavan levane ya, bhumikamme paducc pahudiya. Osakkan ahisakkan, dese savve ya nayavva. || 2026 || Sammajjan varisiyan, uvalevan pupph dive cheva.
Osakkan ussakkan, dese savve ya nayavva. || 2031 || In these two gathas, the term "prosakkan-ussakkan" is used after mentioning actions like badar and subtle parikarma. The explanation of this term is as follows:
"Ete puvvam appano kajjamane cheva navaran sahavo paducc osakkan ussakkan va." Meaning, doing something for oneself that was already being done, but doing it before or after for the sake of a sadhu.

The detailed description of subtle badar parikarma actions and their "prosakkan ussakkan" should be understood from the commentary.

3. "Parikaram" - In the pahud dosha, some parikarma actions are mentioned in the context of doing things before or after. However, this sutra collects parikarma actions with the intention of differentiating between their "mulguna" (original quality) and "uttaraguna" (subsequent quality). This is as follows: 

Page #240:
---------------------------
[140]
The two types of *patti-vansa* are *dharana* and *chattari mula veliyo*. *Mulaguna* with *saparikamma* is the *sejjau nayavva*. || 2046 || *Vansaga*, *kadana*, *ukampana*, *chavana*, *levana*, *duvara*, *bhumhi* are the *y*. *Saparikamma* *sejjau* is the *muluttara-gunesu*. || 2047 ||
*Dumiya*, *dhumia*, *vasia*, *ujjovia*, *balikada*, *avatta* are the *y*. *Sitta*, *sammattha*, *vi* are the *y*. *Visohi*, *kodi*, *kaya*, *vasahi* are the *y*. || 2048 ||
Other types of faults are mentioned in verses 2052-53-54, such as: *padamarg*, *sankramanamarg*, *dagavinka*, making a hole in the wall for air in the summer, closing such places in winter and rainy season, repairing old walls, repairing holes and pits, fixing leaks in the house, repairing joints in walls, etc.
[Nishitasutra
Performing the above *parikarma* work with the intention of a *sadhu* makes the bed a "parikarma dosha" one. According to the *heenaadhik* *savady* tendency, there is *heenaadhikta* in the *prayaschitta-sthan* and *tap*. The commentator has explained that the bed with the fault of *uttaraguna* and *alp-prarambha* has a *laghu-masik* *prayaschitta*.
According to the *Acharang Sutra*, a bed with many *parikarma* becomes eligible for a *sadhu* over time when it is used naturally by a householder. In such a situation, there is no *prayaschitta* for entering and staying in that house.
Brief Meaning
1. A *dharmasala* etc. built for the purpose of only a Jain *sadhu* or for the purpose of many *sadhus* or travelers is called "uddeshik-shayya".
2. If the time of the *parikarma* work of a house built for a householder is shifted forward or backward for the sake of a *sadhu* or if it is done quickly, i.e., if a 5-day work is done in one day, then that householder's personal house also becomes "sapahuḍ shayya".
3. The house is built for the householder. If *parikarma* work is done in it for a *sadhu* before it is used by the householder, then for some time that house is "saparikarma shayya".
It is said that there is a *laghu-masik* *prayaschitta* for entering and staying in these three types of faulty beds.

It should be noted that the construction of the second and third faulty beds is for the householder's own purpose, while the first faulty bed is not built for the purpose of the builders, but only for the purpose of others.
The eligibility of the available *upaashraya* in the present time
The place where *sadhu*-*sadhvi* stay is called 'shayya, vasati and upaashraya' in the *agama* and 'upaashraya or sthanak' in the common language. 

Page #241:
---------------------------
## Fifth Objective

In villages, towns, and cities, there are three types of places:

1. **Kalpya:**  Free from defects, completely pure, suitable for the stay of Sadhus and Sadhvis.
2. **Akalpya:**  Defective, unsuitable for the stay of Sadhus and Sadhvis.
3. **Kalpya-Kalpya:**  Defective, but suitable for stay after a period of time or due to changes made by individuals.

**Kalpya Upashraya:**

1. An individual constructs a new house for personal use, social purposes, or for collective worship of religious activities.
2. A generous householder or a sister dedicates their extra house to the Sangha for religious worship or for the stay of Sadhus and Sadhvis.
3. In large areas, when there are differences of opinion within the community or Sangha, different groups construct separate houses.
4. Even if an Upashraya exists, the need for a new house arises for independent Poshad, Pratikraman, etc., by brothers and sisters during Chaturmas and other periods.
5. A house built by someone is purchased for the purpose of religious worship.

These houses are completely free from defects as they are not built for the purpose of Sadhus and Sadhvis.

**Akalpya Upashraya:**

1. In many villages, there are only one or two Jain householders, or none at all. In such places, a new house is constructed for the stay of Sadhus and Sadhvis by one individual or a group of people.
2. When it is felt that the places of stay for Saints and Sadhvis should be separate, a new house is constructed.
3. In newly established villages or suburbs, or in old villages where religious sentiment or inclination increases, houses are constructed for the religious worship of householders and for the stay of Sadhus and Sadhvis.
4. New houses are constructed for the stay of Sadhvis and for the religious worship of sisters.

These houses are completely Akalpya due to the presence of provincial and mixed-caste defects, as the primary purpose of their construction is for Sadhus and Sadhvis. 

Page #242:
---------------------------
## 142]
**Kalpyakalpya Upashraya**

1. In large assemblies, when constructing a new building, the needs of the saints and holy women are also considered, along with the intended purpose of the building.
2. A house is purchased for the saints and holy women.
3. Sometimes, a house is purchased for the joint use of householders and saints and holy women.
4. Even in a faultless house, various improvements or changes and additions are made for the purpose of the saints and holy women.
5. On the occasion of Chaturmas, some improvements are made for the convenience of the listeners, for the splendor of the assembly, or for the necessary uses of the saints.
6. For the purpose of the saints and holy women, sentient substances or heavy, non-sentient equipment are moved, or the house is cleaned.

These houses, due to subtle intentions, minor beginnings, or actions, become *kalpyaniya* after being used by householders or over time.

**Reference:** In *Shraacha. Shru. 2 A. 5 & 6*, the clothes and utensils purchased for the saint are said to be *kalpyaniya* after being used by the householder. In *Pra. 2 U. 1*, houses with various beginnings and actions done for the saint are also said to be *kalpyaniya* after being used by the householder. Based on these and other scriptural evidence, these houses are said to become *kalpyaniya* over time.

**Summary:**

1. Houses whose construction and actions do not involve the saints and holy women in any way are completely *kalpyaniya*.
2. Houses whose main purpose is for the saints and holy women are completely *akalpyaniya*.
3. Houses whose construction does not have the saints and holy women as the main goal, but considers their needs, or where general or specific actions (improvements) are done for them, are *akalpyaniya* but become *kalpyaniya* over time or after being used by householders. - *Shraacha. Shru. 2. 2 U. 1*.

**Paat**

Along with knowing the options for *sadosha* and *nirdosha* *upashraya*, it is also necessary to know the options regarding *paat*. Because many *upashraya* have *paat* for sleeping and sitting, there are three options regarding these *paat*:

1. *Nirdosha*
2. *Sadosha*
3. *Avyaktadoosha*

*Nirdosha* *paat* are made as needed in the homes of householders, in buildings for social work, in schools, and in libraries, etc., according to the prevailing practice in many provinces. They are sometimes offered to the *upashraya*. 

Page #243:
---------------------------
## Fifth Uddeshak

[1.43
2. In many villages, mats are made for use by Shravaks and Shravikas during Samayik, Poshadh, Pratikraman, etc., due to the nuisance of creatures like scorpions and centipedes. These texts are completely pure.

**Defective Mats:**
1. Mats are made for the purpose of sitting or sleeping by saints, or for sitting while reading lectures.
2. In many places, mats are made for use by both Sadhus and householders.
3. Mats made for the purpose of Sadhus and Sadhvis are purchased and offered to the Upashray. These are mats purchased or made for the purpose of Sadhus.

**Mats with Latent Defects:**
1. Mats are made and offered on special occasions like weddings, without considering whether they are necessary for the Upashray.
2. Mats are offered to the Upashray with the thought that "It is best to give a mat so that my name remains in the Upashray."
These are mats made with no purpose or with a latent purpose.

There are no Agam texts that mention the serious defects of purpose, etc., in relation to mats and other such items. There are also no texts available that clearly state which defective mat remains conceivable for how long and when it becomes conceivable.

In Pracha. Shra. 2.2 U. 3, the text related to mats states that if Sadhus and Sadhvis wish to accept a mat, they must keep in mind:
1. Whether there are any living beings in it.
2. Whether the householder will accept it back.
3. Whether it is too heavy.
4. Whether it is worn out or unusable, etc.

If the mat is free of living beings, acceptable, light, and stable (strong), then it should be accepted, otherwise it should not be taken.

Apart from this, there is no mention of defects related to mats in the Agams. In the construction of mats, etc., only Paricarma actions are performed, which are very minor compared to the conceivable defects of a house that has undergone Purushantar. That is, there is no complete violation of fire, earth, etc., in their making. The wood is also dry, so there is no violation of vegetation. There is also rarely any violation of Apkay. Therefore, there is no possibility of Pradhakarma, etc., defects in them. Therefore, the only defects in their making are Paricarma defects or Krit defects.

Just as a house with Krit or Paricarma defects is considered conceivable over time, so too should all these defective mats be considered conceivable over time. 

Page #244:
---------------------------
## Translation:

[144]
The food or dwelling made for the monks of one sect is not considered to be inherently faulty for the monks of another sect. This topic is not mentioned in the original scriptures but is found in ancient commentaries. The meaning is that those who have similar principles and attire are called "sarmik" (similar) in terms of preaching and gender. Food, dwelling, etc., made for such a "sarmik" monk is not considered suitable for other "sarmik" monks.

The attire and principles of the four Jain sects have diverged, and each sect has established a completely distinct and independent existence. Therefore, the dwelling, etc., made for one Jain sect is not considered suitable for those of another sect.

In a small area with a small community of lay followers, the dwelling, etc., made for all Jain sects with a mixed feeling should be considered inherently faulty for the monks of all sects.

**Penance for the act of "Samyoga-Pratyayik" (sexual association)**

39. A monk who says, "There is no 'Samyoga-Pratyayik' action," or approves of someone who says so, incurs a minor monthly penance.

**Explanation:** "Eating together is 'Samyoga', and the action-karma-bond associated with it is 'Pratyayik'. If someone says there is no such thing, they incur a minor monthly penance. This is the meaning of the sutra."

"A 'Samyogik' monk who is purified by the elimination of the eight 'Uggamdosha' (root faults) through the practice of 'Samyoga' with another 'Samyogik' monk, becomes pure. If he becomes impure due to 'Uggamdosha', then the karma-bond associated with the act of 'Samyoga' and the penance for it are incurred." - Ni. Churni.

Therefore, one should not have wrong beliefs and interpretations regarding "Samyoga-Pratyayik" action. For detailed information on "Samyoga" and "Visamyoga", it is necessary to study the commentary. For general information, refer to the commentary of Brihatkalpa, Chapter 4, Sutra 23.

**Penance for abandoning a worthy "Upadhi" (object of attachment)**

40. A monk who abandons a "Lauya-pay" (cloth made from bark), "Darupaya" (cloth made from wood), "Mattiya-pay" (cloth made from clay), or any other object that is durable and worthy of being worn, incurs a minor monthly penance.

41. A monk who abandons a "Vath" (cloth), "Kambal" (blanket), "Pay-punchhan" (towel), or any other object that is durable and worthy of being worn, incurs a minor monthly penance. 

Page #245:
---------------------------
## Fifth Uddeshak]
[145
42. A monk who breaks or causes to be broken a staff, a stick, a writing implement, or a bamboo needle, incurs a minor monthly penance.
40. A monk who breaks or approves of the breaking of a bowl, a wooden bowl, or an earthen bowl that is complete, sturdy, durable, and appropriate, incurs a minor monthly penance.
41. A monk who breaks or approves of the breaking of a robe, a blanket, or a foot-cloth that is complete, sturdy, durable, and appropriate, incurs a minor monthly penance.
42. A monk who breaks or approves of the breaking of a staff, a stick, a writing implement, or a bamboo needle, incurs a minor monthly penance.
Discussion:
1. That which is sufficient - complete, of the required length and breadth - is called "alan".
2. That which is sturdy - strong, fit for use - is called "thiran".
3. That which is non-returnable - not to be given back to a householder, a monk, or a preceptor, etc., i.e., for which permission to keep has been obtained - is called "dhuran".
4. That which is approved by the scriptures, has the right characteristics, or is free from defects such as origin, etc., i.e., pure and beautiful, is called "dharaniy".
Any tool, even if complete, may become unfit for use due to wear and tear. Even if complete and fit for use, it may be forbidden to keep it permanently. Even if complete, fit for use, and non-returnable, it may be defective or flawed. Therefore, the four adjectives "alan", "thiran", "dhuran", and "dharaniy" have been mentioned. A bowl possessing all four qualities is fit to be kept. Breaking such a bowl incurs penance.
- In the scriptures, three types of bowls are mentioned as being "jatayu-kt", meaning that a monk can only keep three types of bowls.
"Vath-kambla-pay-puchan" - this second sutra mentions three types of garments. Here, the commentary and the commentator refer to "pay-puchan" as a garment, but do not interpret it as meaning "cleaning". This second sutra and the third sutra regarding the staff, etc., have the following commentary verse:
"Payammi u jo gamo, niyama vath-ammi hoti so cheva.
Dand-gamadisu taha, pugve avarammi y padammi." [2164]
This verse, related to the second sutra, also refers to a garment, not to cleaning. The ten sutras related to cleaning are after the staff sutra. They cover all aspects of cleaning.

## Nishīth Sūtra and the Concept of Paypuchaṇ

The Nishīth Sūtra mentions the concept of paypuchaṇ along with the statement of prāyaścitta. Therefore, the statement of paypuchaṇ in relation to clothes is merely a tool for clothes and is different from rajoharaṇ. If the word paypuchaṇ was used in place of rajoharaṇ in the following 10 sūtras, it would be appropriate to understand paypuchaṇ as rajoharaṇ, but this is not the case. ... In other words, in the Āgamas, wherever there is a statement about topics related to rajoharaṇ, the word rajoharaṇ is used. Where the word paypuchaṇ is used, it is not appropriate to interpret it as rajoharaṇ.

Therefore, the meaning of this second sūtra is that "alṁ thiraṁ dhāraṇijja" - one should not tear up clothes. If they are worn out and no longer suitable for any purpose, they can be discarded. If one uses clothes that are fit for discarding without discarding them, they still incur prāyaścitta.

**Danda etc.** - In this sūtra, "al-thiraṁ" etc. are not adjectives. The reason for this is that whether danda etc. are fit to be worn or not, when they become unusable, they should be discarded in the state they are in. These four are auxiliary tools, therefore, when the cause ceases, they can be discarded even if they are still usable, and if they are unusable, they should be discarded in the same state in the sthāṇḍila. There is a possibility of getting hurt by their pieces. Therefore, one should understand that tearing them up is prohibited and incurs prāyaścitta.

If all three types of clothes are worn out, there is no prāyaścitta in tearing them up and discarding them. If earthen and bamboo vessels are worn out or unusable, there is no prāyaścitta in tearing them up and discarding them. If a wooden vessel is worn out or unusable, there is still a possibility of getting hurt by its pieces, therefore, one should understand that it should not be torn up like danda etc.

The purpose of having a separate sūtra for danda etc. is clear - they are auxiliary tools and can be taken back even after being given away.

The purpose of having two separate sūtras for clothes and vessels is also this - there is some difference in their discarding and non-returnable nature, i.e., clothes are not taken and returned, while vessels are sometimes taken and returned for various reasons like applying paste etc. Due to this difference, separate sūtras have been stated for them.

**Paribhidai** - Three different actions are used in the three sūtras. Therefore, paribhidai means to break. Palichhidai means to tear. Palibhanjai means to break. One should understand the characteristics of these three words in this way.

**Prāyaścitta for Opposite Practices Related to Rajoharaṇ**

43. If a monk performs rajoharaṇ without the proper measurement, or if he intends to do so, he incurs prāyaścitta.

44. If a monk performs rajoharaṇ with excessive fineness, or if he intends to do so, he incurs prāyaścitta.

45. If a monk binds rajoharaṇ with a kandausaga, or if he intends to do so, he incurs prāyaścitta. 

Page #247:
---------------------------
## Fifth Uddesaka

[147] 46. A monk who binds the *rajoharan* in an improper way, or approves of one who does so. 47. A monk who gives one *bandhan* to the *rajoharan*, or approves of one who does so. 48. A monk who gives more than three *bandhan* to the *rajoharan*, or approves of one who does so. 49. A monk who holds the *rajoharan* in an *anisitundhara* way, or approves of one who does so. 50. A monk who holds the *rajoharan* in a *vosatundhara* way, or approves of one who does so. 51. A monk who sits on the *rajoharan*, or approves of one who does so. 52. A monk who places the *rajoharan* under his head while sleeping, or approves of one who does so. (He incurs the *laghumasik* penance.)

**Discussion:** The term "rajoharan" is primarily used in reference to the group of *phalikas*, as the actions of having excessive size, fine *phalikas*, sitting on it, and placing it under the head are only relevant to them.

1. The circumference of the group of *phalikas* should be of proper size. The *rajoharan* should be large enough that one can fit their foot within the area covered by it after sweeping. 

Page #248:
---------------------------
[148]
[Nishi Sutra]
In the commentaries, a measurement of 32 angulas is mentioned, which is considered appropriate for the circumference of the fruit. A group of fruits with a circumference of 32 angulas requires a minimum of 16 angulas wide land for sweeping. The length of a foot is usually between 12 and 15 angulas. This allows for the proper performance of the act of sweeping. Therefore, the measurement of the broom should be understood in relation to its circumference. The measurement of 32 angulas should not be understood in relation to the length of the broom stick.
A 9-year-old monk may have a height of 2.5 feet, and a 20-year-old monk may have a height of 6 feet. The rule of 32 angulas for the length of the stick is not suitable for everyone. The circumference of 32 angulas should not be considered absolute, but rather as an upper limit.
From the sutra text, it is sufficient to understand that the broom should have a circumference or length that allows for the proper performance of the act of sweeping, according to the length of the body and the foot. Any circumference or length beyond that is unnecessary and is considered excessive broom. It should be understood that using a broom smaller than the prescribed measurement is also a fault and requires atonement.
2. After mentioning the measurement of the broom in terms of the circumference of all the fruits, this section discusses the quantity of those fruits. The top of the broom, i.e., the top of the fruits that are strung together, will be very thin if the fruits are thin. This will result in a larger number of fruits, and the thin top fruits will not be very durable. Therefore, each fruit and its top should not be too thin, but should be of medium size.
3. 'Kandu sag bandhan' - Kandu sag bandhanam, tajjaitarena jo urayaharanam. Kanduso pun patta u anadino dosha.
Bandhan
2175.
Meaning - Binding the fruits together with a string of the same type (wool, etc.) or of a different type is called "Kandu sag bandhan", and binding them with a cloth strip is called "Kandu sag patta". These are forms of faults, and therefore require atonement.
The commentary states that if the fruits of the broom become worn out and break apart, binding them together will prevent them from scattering and will also facilitate transcription. For example, "Etehi karahi tamev thiggal-karenam sambaddham kareti, jena egpadilehana bhavati." 2177. This explanation also suggests that binding the fruits together is the meaning of "Kandu sag bandhan".
4. Avihie - Binding the broom with a cloth strip or binding the entire broom in a cloth or bag, and making it difficult to transcribe (for transcription) and difficult to sweep (for sweeping), is called "Pravidhi bandhan".
5. Paran tihan - To keep the broom properly bound with a wooden stick, three bindings can be applied. It is not necessary to apply more than three bindings to the broom. Applying more bindings than necessary or applying even one binding without purpose requires atonement.

6. Anissiddha - - "Anissittha naam titthakarehiṁ adiṇṇa" ahva bitio aaso - jaṁ guru jaṇṁ aṇanuṇṇāyaṁ taṁ anissittha. "
Gatha
Pancatirıktaṁ davve u, acittaṁ dullbhaṁ ca dosam tu.
Bhavammi vannamollā, aṇanuṇṇāyaṁ va jaṁ gurunā. || 2182 ||
The five types of rajoharan that are prescribed by the Tirthankara Bhagwan are: wool, camel hair, flax, vacchakadhas, and munja. Brih. U. 2, and Thananga A. 5. Any rajoharan other than these five types is called "Anissiddha". The commentary also states that, based on the distinction of dravya-kshetra-kala-bhava, any rajoharan that is different from the five types, or is rare and valuable, or is accepted without the knowledge of the guru, is "Anissittha".
7. 'Vosattha' - Auggha khettao, pareṇ jaṁ taṁ tu hoti vos areṇṁ avosattha, vosatthe
.
Dharent aṇadi || 2185 ||
7. The rajoharan kept away from the atma-praman, i.e., the body-praman, is called 'Vosattha', and if it is within the atma-praman avgraha, it is called 'Avosattha'. Keeping 'Vosattha' violates the injunction and incurs prāyaścitta.
The meaning is that the rajoharan should always be kept with you and near you. If it is kept at a distance of one dhanush (bow), there is no prāyaścitta. If it is kept further than that, there is a laghumasik prāyaścitta.
In the prevalent practice, some observe a limit of 5 hands. Some also say that the entire house is the limit. But it is more appropriate to say atma-praman, as it can be easily and quickly used when needed.
'Muhpottiy nisejjāe eseva gamo vosatṭā vosatu puvvavarapadesu. || 2188 ||
Thus, the commentator has indicated that the mukhavastrika and nisadya (seat) should also be kept in mind for 'Avos' and 'Vos' by way of upalakshana.
8.
Adhiṣṭhita - Standing, sitting, and sleeping on it can be included in being adhiṣṭhita. Since there is a separate sutra for 'Ussiśa-mūle' (placing under the head), it should be understood that all other possible actions are included in being adhiṣṭhita. The rajoharan is used for cleaning the feet or the body, but it should not be used as a seat or bed. Placing it under the head is called placing a pillow, and sleeping, sitting, etc., on the rest of the body is called being adhiṣṭhita. That is, it is not permissible to press the rajoharan under any part of the body.

9. Ussiśamūle - After the churni of this sutra, the original text of the Uddeshak ends. Therefore, the eleventh sutra "Tuyatteï" that is available seems to have been added later. The commentator has also 

Page #250:
---------------------------
##  [150]
[Nishīthasūtra]

The term "tuyattēnte" has been used for the analysis of "ussīsamūle" and its explanation has been completed in the discussion of the sūtra "ussīsamūle ṭhavai". No independent sūtra with the verb "tuyattēi" has been shown. It is clear that this sūtra was not available to the Chūrṇikāra and the Bhāṣyakāra. Therefore, only 10 sūtras of rajoharan seem to be relevant here.

Bhāṣya Gāthā - "Je bhikṣū tuyattēnte, rajaharaṇam sīsage ṭhavejjahi" || 2192 ||

This Bhāṣya Gāthā is the explanation of "ussīsamūle ṭhavai". It is possible that someone wrote a new sūtra after seeing "tuyattēnte" in it. But the clear meaning of the prose is that 'a monk who keeps rajoharan at his head while sleeping is liable to atonement'. Therefore, it is not appropriate to imagine two separate sūtras from this prose.

**Summary of the Fifth Uddeshaka**

1-11. Standing, sitting, sleeping, eating, excreting, studying, etc. on the sentient earth around the trunk of a tree. 12. Getting one's sheet (etc.) sewn by a householder. 13. Making the strings for tying small sheets (etc.) long. 14. Eating un-sentient leaves of neem (etc.) after washing them with water. 15-22. Not turning over the foot-cloth and staff (etc.) of the bed-maker or others at the specified time. 23. Using the bed-spread after returning it without asking for permission again. 24. Spinning wool, thread (etc.). 25-30. Making or keeping a staff that is sentient, colored, and attractive with many colors. 31-32. Going to graze in a newly settled village (etc.) or in new mines. 33-35. Making or playing a vīṇā from the mouth (etc.) and playing other instruments (etc.). 36-38. Entering or staying in a bed that is intentional, with a visible form, and with an action. 39. Prohibiting the action of sexual desire. 40-41. Breaking a usable vessel or tearing pieces of cloth, blanket, foot-cloth and throwing them away. 42. Breaking pieces of a staff and throwing them away. 43-52. Making it bigger than the rajoharan-measure, making the beans subtle, connecting the beans together, tying them together in an improper way, making even one unnecessary tie, making more than three ties even if necessary. 43-52. Making a rajoharan of another kind except the five types, keeping it away, pressing it under the feet (etc.), keeping it under the head (etc.).

The above activities lead to a small monthly atonement.

**Conclusion**

In the first four Uddeshakas, all the sūtras have been collected in two divisions, but... 

Page #251:
---------------------------
[Fifth Uddeshak]
[151 It is sufficient to give only a brief instruction regarding the 52 sutras of this Uddeshak without collecting them into two divisions.
The subject matter of Sutra No. 23 is dealt with in the eighth Uddeshak of the Kavya Vyavahar Sutra, and the subject matter of Sutras 36 and 38 is dealt with in Pracharang Shru. 2 A. 2 U. 1. The remaining subjects of this Uddeshak are not found in any other Agam, but they are those which, while giving clear information about the rules and prohibitions, lay down the rules of atonement. This is the special feature of this Uddeshak compared to the previous Uddeshaks.
1. The subject matter of 3 sutras of this Uddeshak is mentioned in other Agams, such as sutras 23, 36, 38. 2. The subject matter of the remaining 49 sutras of this Uddeshak is not mentioned in any other Agam.

* **10.** Utt. A. 1, Ga. 26
* **11.** Suyagadaang Shru. 1, A. 4, is related to Brahmacharya.
* **12.** In Acharang Sutra A. 5, U. 4, the Sutrakar mentions Santhara as the final resort for protecting Brahmacharya, among other measures.
* **13.** In Pracharang Sutra A. 8, U. 4, the Sutrakar suggests death by hanging as a means to protect Brahmacharya and considers such death as auspicious.
* **14.** Both 'Nav Vaad' and 'Das Brahmacharya Samadhi Sthan' discuss similar topics. Following them completely is essential for complete protection of Brahmacharya.
* **15.** Not following 'Nav Vaad' can lead to the occasional rise of Mohkarma, which can result in all the actions described in this section. Engaging in transgressions or immoral acts prevents the seeker from remaining stable in self-control. The Agamas consider Mohandha (delusion) to be a deeper blindness than other blindnesses. Therefore, the seeker should live according to the Agamas with constant vigilance. All the sutras in this section mention the atonement for polluting the Brahmacharya Mahavrata. They also mention various tendencies that pollute the Brahmacharya Vrata, and all the sutras include the phrase 'Mauggamass Mehunavadiae'. This is because the fundamental intention in each tendency is 'to engage in sexual intercourse with a woman'.
* **16.** The Nishith Sutra is considered confidential due to the detailed description of atonement for Brahmacharya violation in the sixth and seventh sections. Here, confidentiality means that the student of this Sutra should be highly qualified and that the study should not lead their soul towards any kind of subject-passion.
* **17.** In this age of publication, it is impossible to prevent the publication of any famous Agama or text due to the continuous development of printing presses. However, the student of this Sutra should be determined to calm their distorted tendencies. Only then can the study of this Sutra lead them to Samadhi.
* **18.** Sutra No. 13 provides information about letter writing. According to this Sutra, it seems that the practice of writing and keeping writing materials was prevalent in the Sadhu community during the Agama period. This section mentions atonement for writing a letter with the intention of sexual intercourse. Atonement for the tendency to write, apart from the intention of sexual intercourse, is not mentioned in any other section. While the systematic compilation of Agamas might have happened during the time of Devadhiggani, it does not seem that the Sadhu community completely prohibited writing and keeping writing materials before that time. This Sutra makes it clear.

## Eighth Precept

[173]

One should not engage in conversation, standing, etc. with women. In the Dashakalika Sutra, sexual intercourse is compared to the poison of a snake, and even intercourse with a woman who is a hundred years old is prohibited. The commentary states:

"Even if it is with an old mother or sister, etc., who is alone, even a discussion of Dharma is not appropriate. What then to say of other conversations with young women, etc." [2344]

Commentary: "Even if it is with an old mother or sister, etc., who is alone, even a discussion of Dharma is not appropriate. What then to say of other conversations with young women, etc."

Meaning: If even a discussion of Dharma is not appropriate with an old mother or sister, etc., who is alone, then it is self-evident that other conversations with young women, etc. are prohibited.

Explanation of specific terms:

1. **Viharam karei:** Here, the meaning of "vihar" is to stay together. Therefore, one should not understand the meaning here as "traveling from village to village."
2. **Uccaram va pasavanam va parituvei:** "Goes to the land of the dead."
3. **Anariyam adi:** "Anariyam kamakaha, nirantaram va apriyam kaham kaheti-kamaniṭṭharakahao, eta cev asamanpao gga."
4. **Ujjānam:** "Where people gather, or the elevated place of a city, that is ujjānam." "Near the city, there are places for vehicles, games, etc." - Rayappaseneya Sutra Commentary.
5. **Nijjānāṁ rāyādiāṁ niggamaṇṭhāṇāṁ nijjānīyā, nagaraniggame jaṁ ṭhiyam taṁ nijjānāṁ. Etesu tev giha kaya-ujjāṇa-nijjāna-giha.** "The place of exit from the city, etc., is nijjānīyā, the place where one stands at the exit of the city, that is nijjānāṁ. These are the houses in the ujjāṇa, nijjānā, and giha."
6. **Aṭasi:** "On top of a palace, in a house on top of a wall, or in a house for soldiers on top of a wall."
7. **Aṭṭālayansi:** "A special place of shelter on top of a wall." "A temple on top of a wall of a fort." "In the city, there are houses, and in the same place, there are aṭṭālagos." "Battle towers."
8. **Cariyansi:** "A path eight cubits wide between the city walls." "The path eight cubits wide around the house is cariyā."
9. **Gopura:** "A gate with a tower." "A strong gate, two strong gates attached to the house, the space between them is the gopura."
10. **Taṇa-Tusa-Bhusā:** "A place for grass, etc., a place for grass, a place for rice, etc., a place for husks, etc."

##  Translation:

**[174]**
**[Nishīth Sūtra]**

**11. Jāṇa-Jugga-** "Jugādi jāṇāṇam akuḍḍā sāla sakudḍam giham. Assādiyāṇ vāhaṇā tāṇam sāla giham vā."
**12. Pariyāga-** "Pāsandinō pariyāga tesi āvasaho sāla giham." Bhāṣya Gāthā 2426 and 2428, as well as the Chūrṇi, explain this term. While the first sūtra mentions "pariyāvasahesu," there is no need for further explanation.
**13. Kuviyam-** The Bhāṣyakāra does not explain this term. The Chūrṇikāra explains "kammiyam sāla" in place of this word. Elsewhere, the word "kuviyam" means a workshop for making iron tools, etc. The Chūrṇi explains it as "Chuhādi jaththa kammivijjati sā kammantashālā giham vā."
**14. Mahāgiham-** Mahantā giham mahāgiham = a large house or the main house.
**15. Mahākulan-** "Inbhakulaadi" "bahujanaaiṇṇam."

In addition to these places, one should understand by implication that the places like Upāśraya, etc., are also included.

**Uttara. A. 1 Gā. 26** also prohibits a monk from standing alone with a woman and talking to her in many places. Therefore, a monk can only talk to a woman if another woman or man is present. One should not understand this as a prohibition against accepting alms from a woman alone or listening to her auspicious teachings when she comes to the Upāśraya.

**Prohibition against telling religious stories in a gathering of women at night**

**10. Je bhikku rāo vā, viyāle vā, itthimajjhagaē, itthisansatte itthi-parivude aparimājāē kaham kaheī, kaheṇtam vā sāijjai.**

**Meaning:** A monk who tells an unlimited story in the night or evening, 1. in a gathering of women, 2. in a gathering with women, 3. surrounded by women, or who approves of someone telling such a story, (will incur the Guruchaumāsi penance).

**Discussion:** While the Āgamas prohibit sexual contact with women, they do not completely prohibit telling religious stories to women. The prohibition against telling religious stories, etc., to a woman alone or to a monk alone is found in other sūtras and in the above sūtras. There is no prohibition if there are many women or many monks. In other words, if there are many women or women with men, religious stories can be told during the day. However, it is essential to exercise discretion regarding age, suitability, and the Guru's instructions.

The present sūtra prohibits telling religious stories at night. Therefore, even if there is only a gathering of women or a gathering of women with men at night, one should not tell religious stories.

## Eighth Uddeshak

[175 Aparamanaae]
A monk who has gone out for alms cannot preach Dharma in the house of a householder. However, he can answer a very important question briefly - Brihatkalpa Uddeshak 3. The word 'Aparamanaae' is used in the sutra with the same meaning. The same meaning is stated in Bhashya Churni etc. Bhashya Gatha 'Itthina Majjhammi, Itthisansatte Parivude Tahi.
Chavu Panch U Parimanam, Ten Paran Kahant Anaadi ||2430||' 'Parimanam Jav Tinni Chauro Panch Va Vagaranani, Parato Chatthaadi Aparamanam.'
Here, three, four or five questions or verses are called limited. Six questions or more are called unlimited.
Staying in the house of a householder after taking alms is prohibited in Brihatkalpa, but according to the Brihatkalpa sutra, there is also a provision for giving a brief answer in exceptional circumstances. Therefore, the word 'Aparamanaae' in this sutra should be understood as an exceptional statement.
For a monk, any other story or false story is completely prohibited, therefore, here, preaching Dharma etc. is expected from the story. If it seems appropriate, he can tell a brief Dharma story or answer a question in the said assembly at night. Only if the limit is exceeded, does the monk receive Guruchaumasi penance.

## Penance for Contact with a Nigranthi

11. Je Bhikkhu Sagnicchiaae Va, Paraganicchiaae Va, Nigganthiee Saddi Gamaanugaman Duijjamanee Puroo Gachchhmane, Pittto Riyamanee, Ohayamanasankappe Chita-Soyasagar Sampavithe, Karayalpalhatthamuhe, Attajjhanoovagae, Viharam Va Karei Jav Asamanpaauggan Kahm Kahei, Kahentam Va Saizjji.
Meaning - A monk who travels from village to village with a Sadhvi of his own or another group, while thinking and contemplating, is anxious, immersed in the ocean of sorrow, keeps his face on his palm, meditates in sorrow, or tells a love story that is not appropriate for a monk, or approves of the one who tells it.
(He receives Guruchaumasi penance.)

## Discussion

Just as contact or acquaintance with a woman is prohibited except for Dharma story or Gochari, similarly, a monk should consider contact with a Sadhvi to be prohibited except for self-study, reading of sutra meanings.
Generally, it is prohibited for a monk and a Sadhvi to sit or stand in each other's place (Upashraya) - Brihatkalpa Uddeshak 3, Sutra 1-2.
This sutra mentions penance for a monk's travel and excessive contact with a Sadhvi. 

Page #276:

## 176]
[Nishīthasūtra
In exceptional circumstances, monks and nuns can serve each other in many ways and can also criticize and do penance for each other. But they cannot serve or criticize each other in a dedicated manner - Vyavahāra Sūtra Uddesa-5.
Therefore, monks and nuns should keep their mutual service, etc., only in exceptional circumstances and exchange necessary readings, etc. Apart from this, they should not increase mutual contact. This is the Jinājñā. Night residence penance in the Upāśraya
12. If a monk keeps a woman, whether she is a relative or a stranger, a devotee or another, inside the Upāśraya for half a night or a full night, or approves of someone keeping her, (he incurs Guruchaumāsi penance).
Meaning - A monk who keeps a woman, whether she is a relative or a stranger, a devotee or another, inside the Upāśraya for half a night or a full night, or approves of someone keeping her, (he incurs Guruchaumāsi penance).
Discussion - The sūtra does not explicitly mention "woman" or "man", but in context, it should be understood as penance for keeping a woman. The Bhāṣyaṇi also says that
"This sūtra is about a woman." Gāthā - Itthi paḍucch suttam, sahiraṇṇa sabhoyane ya āvāse.
Jai nissangaya je vā mehuṇa nisibhoyanaṃ kujjā ||2469|| Adham vā rāi'addham rāi'e do jāma, 'vā' vikappeṇa egaṃ jāma. Chauro jāma kasiṇā rāi 'vā' vikappeṇa tiṇṇī jāma. The word "addham" can mean not only half a night but also an incomplete night. In Uttarādhyayana Sūtra A. 34, the word "muhuttaddham" is used. Its meaning is not only half a muhūrta but also less than a muhūrta. Accordingly, here too, in addition to the whole night, less or more than a night can also be included. Therefore, the meaning of this sūtra is that if a woman is kept in the Upāśraya for a short or long time at night, then penance is incurred.
Samvasāve'i - "Keeping" can happen in two ways: 1. Asking her to stay 2. Not stopping her from staying. Therefore, one should not ask a woman to stay inside the Upāśraya at night, and if she wants to stay without being asked, one should stop her. "Not stopping her" also means letting her stay. Therefore, if one asks her to stay or does not stop her, then penance is incurred according to the statement "samvasāve'i".
Due to the above explanation, many manuscripts also have a separate sūtra about not stopping her. But its syntax seems incorrect. Therefore, that sūtra seems to be an interpolation. Because the subject matter is fulfilled by this accepted sūtra. That sūtra is not present in the original text of the published Chūrṇi.

**Penance for going out with a woman at night**

13. A monk who keeps a woman, whether she be a relative or a non-relative, an upasika or a non-upasika, within his shelter for half a night or a full night, or who goes out or enters for her sake, or who approves of someone going out or entering for her sake, incurs the Guruchaumasi penance.

**Explanation:** The previous sutra spoke of the penance for keeping a woman. The meaning of this sutra, which follows, is that a monk should not keep a woman, and even if a woman remains there due to circumstances, he should not go out with her at night due to physical constraints.

There could be two reasons for going out with her: 1. The woman is afraid, 2. Or the monk is afraid.

**Explanation:**

From the sixth *uddeshak* to the thirteenth *sutr* of this *uddeshak*, the text discusses penances related to women. These penances require a *guruchaumasiya* penance. From *sutr* 14 to the end of the eighth *uddeshak* and throughout the ninth *uddeshak*, the text discusses penances related to various types of *rajapind* (royal alms) and other situations involving kings.

The text uses three specific adjectives to describe the king, which collectively mean "a very great king." The meaning of each word is as follows:

1. *mudiyan* - of pure lineage, 

Page #279:
---------------------------
## Eighth Objective

[179] 2. **Murdhabhishikt** - Anointed by many kings, meaning anointed by many kings or by parents.
3. **Rano Khattiyanam** - A Kshatriya king. A pure-blooded Kshatriya king anointed by many kings or by parents. These three epithets are merely descriptive of the nature and importance. Therefore, it should be understood that these words are used in relation to a very great king.
The implication is that it is not permissible for monks and nuns to accept food, etc., from a **Murdhabhishikt** great king during the reign of the 24th Tirthankara. Therefore, it should not be understood as a prohibition on landlords, chieftains, etc.

1. **Samavaasu** - **Samavayo** is the gathering of assemblies, the association of merchants, etc. - Rajendra Kosh. **Samavayo** is the gathering - Sankhchhed Shreniyadeh. - Pracha. Shru. 2, A. 1, U. 2. **Samavayo** is the group of food. - Churni.
2. **Pindaniyare** - **Pitripindam** means the offering to the deceased. - Aacha. 1 **Pindanigaro** is the offering of food, **Pitripindapadanam** (offering of **Pitripinda**) or **Pindanigaro**. - Churni.
3. **Rudra** - **Bhaginayo** is **Rudra**. **Rudra** is **Shiva**. In Acharanga, its meaning is God. In Rajendra Kosh, it is described as "**Mahadev-Maheshwar**" with a detailed narrative of its origin. 4. **Mukunda** - **Mukudo** is **Baldev**. - Churni. **Vasudeva Mahotsav**. - Bhag Sh. 9, U. 33 5. **Cheiy** - **Cheiyam** - Temple. 6. **Sar** - A naturally formed water body - pond, without excavation. 7. **Tadag** - A pond prepared by excavation.

Many types of festivals are started at different times for various reasons and continue for a long time on that fixed date.
If a monk accepts food prepared for these festivals by the king, he incurs **Guruchaumasi** atonement. Going to such places has the possibility of many faults, and both the king's happiness or anger can lead to many faults. Therefore, one should not go to such places for alms.

Sutras 15-16. refer to the various places of a king who has gone elsewhere due to work. The atonement for accepting the food prepared for the king at those places is mentioned. The commentator has said that these are examples, and it should be understood in relation to other such places.
1. **Uttarshala** - 'Where the king goes first, that is the **Uttarshala** house to be considered.' '**Aththanigaadimandavo Uttarshala, Mulagiham Asambaddham Uttargiham**.
Sutra 18 mentions the food to be given as charity.

Entering or leaving the inner palace is not virtuous, therefore this is suitable for me. I will bring food, drink, edibles and delicacies from the inner palace here," if he accepts this statement or approves of the one who accepts it. (He incurs Guruchaumasi Prāyaścitta.)
Discussion- The king's inner palace is of three types: 1. Juṇṇatepuraṁ-Apari-bhogyā-Vṛddhā Rānīyoṁ kā antaḥpura. 2. Navantepuraṁ Pari-bhogyā Yuva Rānīyoṁ kā antaḥpura. 3. Kaṇṇatepuraṁ-A-prāpta Yauvanā-Kanyā Rājakumārīyoṁ kā antaḥpura.
Rāyantepuriyā-Cūrṇikāra has interpreted this as "the king's queen". This meaning is not relevant, therefore it is not taken here.
The second meaning is-'Daasī'
The third meaning is-The protector of the inner palace, who usually stands near the door. This meaning is relevant.
Therefore, 'Antepuriyā' means one who resides in the inner palace or one who protects the inner palace.
Due to this difference in meaning, some alternatives have arisen in the text of Sutra No. 5, their true decision has not been possible.
Where the female doorkeeper resides, there the feminine "Jo taṁ evaṁ vadantī paḍisuṇeī" where the male doorkeeper is, there the masculine "Jo taṁ evaṁ vadantaṁ paḍisuṇeī" in this way both readings can be correct.

14. Food prepared for visitors, or one who approves of such food being taken. (He incurs Guruchaumasi Pratikraman.)]

**Discussion:** In many royal families or wealthy families, there is a custom of offering such food daily.

---------------------------
## Ninth Uddeshak [185]

A monk who goes out or enters, or approves of someone going out or entering (such a place), incurs the Guru-Chaumasi Pratikraman.

There are six Dosha-Sthanas:

1. Kotthagarasala (Granary)
2. Bhandagarasala (Treasury)
3. Panasala (Liquor Shop)
4. Ksheerasala (Dairy)
5. Ganjasala (Market)
6. Mahanasasala (Kitchen)

**Explanation:**

After entering a capital city or similar place, a monk going out for alms should first inquire about these six places of the king. Because these are the six places of Dosha (faults). If he does not inquire about these six places within 4-5 days and goes out for alms, he incurs the Guru-Chaumasi Pratikraman.

**Explanation of Special Words:**

1. **Kotthagara:** A storehouse for grains, nuts, etc.
2. **Bhandagara:** A treasury for gold, silver, jewels, etc.
3. **Pana:** "Sura-Madhu-Sidhu-Khandag-Macchandiy-Muddiya Pabhiin Panagani." Places of liquor, etc.
4. **Ksheera:** "Kheerghar, Jath Kheeram Dadi-Navaniyam-Takkaadi Acchanti." A place for milk, curd, ghee, etc.
5. **Ganj:** "Jath Dhannam Dabhijjati Sa Ganjasala. Jath Sanasattarasani Dhanani Kottijanti." A place where seventeen types of grains are stored.
6. **Mahanasa:** Uvakkhadanasala - Kitchen.

If a monk does not know about these places and goes there for alms, he may encounter the guards of those places. If the guards are benevolent, he may incur the fault of accepting Rajapinda (royal offering). If they are hostile, they may consider him a thief and cause him harm or even arrest him.

"Je Rakkhaga Te Bhadd Panta, Bhaddesu Rayapadadosa, Pantesu Genhanadayo Dosha" (Churni). Therefore, it is essential to know about these places.

**Pratikraman for Trying to See the King, etc.:**

8. A monk who sees or tries to see the king, a Kshatriya, a wealthy person, or a person who has been honored with a crown, either coming or going, incurs the Pratikraman.

9. A monk who sees or tries to see the king, a Kshatriya, a wealthy person, or a woman adorned with all ornaments, either coming or going, incurs the Pratikraman. 

Page #286:
---------------------------
##  English Translation:

**186]**

**8.** A monk who walks even a single step with the intention of seeing a pure lineage, crowned Kshatriya king, or approves of someone who does so, incurs Guru-Chaumasika penance.

**9.** A monk who walks even a single step with the intention of seeing the queens of a pure lineage, crowned Kshatriya king, adorned with all ornaments, or approves of someone who does so, incurs Guru-Chaumasika penance.

**Discussion:**

The Acharanga Sutra prohibits seeing many objects and places, and the 12th Uddesaka of the Nishita Sutra states that they incur Laghu-Chaumasika penance. Seeing a king or queen is considered particularly objectionable, hence Guru-Chaumasika penance is mentioned for it in these two Sutras. The commentator explains the order of penance as follows:

"If one thinks of seeing, it is Maas Guru, if one rises to see, it is Chatur-Laghu, and if one walks, it is Chatur-Guru." "Even if one walks a single step, it is Chatur-Guru, what to speak of seeing? This leads to the transgression of the injunction, and if the king is favorable or unfavorable, many other faults may also arise."

**Penance for consuming food offered to a king who has gone out for hunting etc.**

**10.** A monk who accepts or approves of the acceptance of food, drink, edibles, or delicacies of a pure lineage, crowned Kshatriya king who has gone out to hunt for meat, fish, or game, incurs Guru-Chaumasika penance.

**Discussion:**

"They mention food, drink, edibles, and delicacies for the king who has gone out to hunt, and they also mention food for those who are engaged in the practice of penance." This means that even if the king has food at the place where he has gone out to hunt for meat, fish, etc., it is not permissible to accept such food.

**Penance for consuming food from the place where the king has eaten.**

**11.** A monk who accepts or approves of the acceptance of food, drink, edibles, or delicacies from the place where a pure lineage, crowned Kshatriya king has eaten, incurs Guru-Chaumasika penance. 

Page #287:
---------------------------
## Ninth Uddeshak

**11.** A monk who partakes of food or approves of someone partaking of food in a house where a pure-lineage, crowned Kshatriya king is being served food, before the royal council rises, before they leave, and before everyone has left, incurs the Guru-Chaumasī Prāyaścitta.

**Explanation:** If a person has arranged a light meal or a full meal and has invited the king to it, then a monk should not go there to beg for food as long as the king and his companions are eating. It is not forbidden to partake of food after they have left. Partaking of food before that and going there is objectionable. Therefore, if it is seen or known that the king has been invited there, i.e., he is eating there, then going to that house or partaking of food there incurs the Guru-Chaumasī Prāyaścitta.

"Aṇṇataraghaṇena bhedadarśanaṁ, śarīraṁ upavrihayanīti upavrihaṇīyā" "Sā ya cauṇviha āsaṇādi." "Jementass raṇṇo uvavūhaṇīyā āṇiyā, 'piṭṭhao' tti vuttaṁ bhavati. Taṁ jo tāe parisāe aṇuṭṭhitāe gehati tass ṅkā (cauguru). Rāyapindo ceva so. Āsaṇāṇi mottu udghaṭṭiyāe accchanti, tato kei niggatā bhiṇṇā, aseśesu niggatēsu vocchiṇṇā, erise ṇ rāyapindo." - Chūṇi p. 459-60.

The meaning of this sūtra is that it is not proper for a monk to go to a house where the king is eating. According to this sūtra, there is no Prāyaścitta for going there after the king has eaten and left.

**12.** If it is known that the king is staying in this place, then a monk who stays in that house, in any part of that house, or in any place near that house, studies, performs Japa, partakes of food, drink, edibles, or delicacies, or excretes or approves of someone doing so, incurs the Guru-Chaumasī Prāyaścitta.

**Explanation:** The previous sūtra spoke of the Prāyaścitta for going to the house where the king had come to eat, and this sūtra speaks of the Prāyaścitta for staying in the house where the king has stayed for a day or two.

The meaning of these sūtras is that a monk should stay away from the places where the king eats, stays, or makes a short stay. It is not objectionable for the king to come to the monk's place, but the monk should not go to any place where the king is staying or even near it.

Sūtrakṛtāṅgasūtra A. 2, U. 2, Gā. 18 also says that...

**(He incurs Guruchaumasi Pratikraman)**

**Discussion:** When traveling to these places and returning, food is prepared at the stopover points. The Pratikraman for consuming this food is mentioned here. Because there is a possibility of many faults like auspiciousness, inauspiciousness, and doubt, etc., in consuming food prepared for such journeys.

**Pratikraman for travel during the coronation:**

**19.** A monk who leaves or enters a city where a pure-lineage, crowned Kshatriya king is being coronated, or approves of someone doing so, incurs Guruchaumasi Pratikraman.

**Discussion:** When a coronation is taking place, there is constant coming and going of royal officials and people in the city for various tasks. During such times, a monk should stay in his place and should not go anywhere. Or, he should not go to or from that direction. There is a possibility of auspiciousness, inauspiciousness, and many faults due to the crowded nature of the place while traveling.

**Pratikraman for frequent entry into the capital:**

**20.** A monk who leaves or enters, or approves of someone leaving or entering, any of the ten cities declared as capitals, where pure-lineage, crowned Kshatriya kings have been coronated, twice or thrice in a month, incurs Guruchaumasi Pratikraman. These cities are well-known by their names: 1. Champa, 2. Mathura, 3. Varanasi, 4. Sravasti, 5. Saketapur, 6. Kampilya, 7. Kaushambi, 8. Mithila, 9. Hastinapur, 10. Rajagriha.

**Discussion:** Twelve Chakravartis have been in these ten capitals. Shantinath, Kunthunath, and Aranath, these three Chakravartis were in the same Hastinapur city. It is forbidden to go to or from these capitals more than once a month. Pratikraman may not be incurred for going a second time due to a specific reason, but it is definitely incurred for going a third time.

There is a possibility of many faults like suspicion of being a spy by royal officials, etc., when going to or from these large capitals more than once a month. In previous scriptures, the king...

##  [Nishosha Sutra]

This Sutra advises on the importance of discretion in matters like food, residence, coronation, etc. It prohibits frequent visits to the capital cities of great kings and outlines the atonement for such actions.

The commentary mentions the possibility of various other transgressions related to restraint. These capital cities are often filled with festivities for the king and the citizens. There is an atmosphere conducive to sensual desires, with dances, songs, musical instruments, and alluring appearances of men and women. Witnessing this can lead to a loss of restraint and mindfulness, either through memories of past indulgences or curiosity for the uninitiated. The noise and commotion of the people can also hinder self-study and meditation. The abundance of vehicles and crowded streets can lead to collisions and other inconveniences during begging rounds. Due to these drawbacks, frequent visits to large capital cities and other major towns are not beneficial for the restrained.

**Atonement for accepting food offered by the king's officials and staff:**

Page #293:
---------------------------
## Ninth Uddeshak [193]

There is a possibility of faults such as the fault of doing, etc. If these individuals, after being given by the king and accepting them, are of an undesirable and harmful lineage, then there is no atonement in accepting food from them with the consent of the Eshana committee.

It is inconceivable that it would be prepared for them at the king's place or kept separate for them. The atonement for accepting the same food has been mentioned in the above sutras.

**Sutra 21** - "Khattiyanam adi" - Kshatraat Trayate iti Kshatriya Aaraksaka iti arthaha. Adhivoraya. Kutsito Raya Kuraaya Ahva Pacchantanivo Kuraaya. "Rajavamshe Sthitaha Rajno Matul-Bhagineadayah Rayavansatthiya." Je Eteshi Cheva Preshya-Presita Dandapasikaprabhrityah.
- Ni. Churni Va Aacha. Shru. 2, A. 1, U. 3

**Sutra 22** - In this sutra, "Velambagaan" could mean those who play jumping and leaping games, etc. However, due to a script error, the true meaning is not clear, and since it is found in many copies, "Khelayaan Va" = "those who play various types of games" is a separate reading and its meaning.

_In this sutra, the word "Chhattanuyaan Va" is also found more often, which seems to be due to a script error. It seems that this reading was not before the Churnikar, and it is mentioned separately in Sutra 25. Therefore, it has not been included here as it is not necessary._

**Sutra 23** - "Poshak" - those who take care of food, medicine, water, those who provide physical service, bath, massage, etc., those who take care of the cleanliness of the dwelling place, i.e., those who provide complete protection, are called "Poshak". In many copies, "Makkadposayaan" is not there. But in Aacharaanga Shru. 2, A. 10, the word "Makkad" is present in some copies between the words "Kukkud" and "Titar", therefore, the word "Makkad" has been included in the sutra here.

"Brihattara Rakta Padaa Vattha, Alpatara Lavaga" - those with small red feet are "Lavak". Those with large red feet are called "Battak".

**Sutra 24** - In place of this sutra, three or four sutras are also found in many copies. "Ni and Bhashya in" Iman Suttavakkhanam" Asaan Ya Hatthina Ya, Damaga Je Padhamtaae Viniyanti. Pariyatt-Menth Paccha, Aroha Juddhakalaammi ||2601||"

"Je Padham Vinyam Gahethi Te Damaga, Je Jana Jogasaneehi Vaavaram Va Vahethi Te Mentha, Juddhakale Je Aruhamti Te Aroha ||2601||"

The previous sutra mentions those who nurture 21 animals and birds, including horses and elephants. This sutra mentions those who train horses and elephants, those who ride them, those who adorn them with saddles, clothes, and ornaments, and those who ride them in battle, as known from the gatha. The word "Pariyatt" is not explained in Churni. For this reason, making separate sutras, three...

##  English Translation:

**[194]**

The *Nishith Sutra* has become one Sutra, not four. The commentary mentions the phrase "Imām Suttavakkānaṃ" which indicates that there was only one Sutra during the time of the commentary. Based on this analysis, only one Sutra is included here.

**Sutra 25:** "The *Sathvaha* (merchants) say, 'The *Rāyasatthama* (merchants) bring and announce the *Rāyasattha* (merchandise).'" They bring and invite the *Rāyasattha* (merchandise) or announce the king's message.

The original words for the remaining terms are: 1. *Sanvāhaka* (carrier), 2. *Abhyangaka* (anointer), 3. *Udvarttaka* (lifter), 4. *Majjāpaka* (massager), 5. *Mandāpaka* (decorator).

Therefore, the original text is: 1. *Sanbāhayāṇaṃ*, 2. *Abhangayāṇaṃ*, 3. *Uvvattṭayāṇaṃ*, 4. *Majjāvayāṇaṃ*, 5. *Mandāvayāṇaṃ*.

The first three terms refer to those who "massage, etc.", while the last two refer to those who "bathe, adorn, etc." Therefore, the original words have been corrected for scribal errors. The subsequent terms like "Chhattaggahāṇaṃ" are found to be correct.

**Sutra 26:** This Sutra describes four individuals who work in the inner palace: 1. *Krit-napusaka* (eunuch) - a guard who resides within the inner palace. 2. *Daṇḍarakṣaka* (guard) - a guard who protects the palace from outside, armed with a staff. 3. *Dvārāpāla* (gatekeeper) - one who stands at the gate. 4. *Kanchuki* (eunuch) - a eunuch who performs internal and external tasks for the queens and resides within the inner palace.

**Sutra 27:** This Sutra mentions two names of female slaves, indicated by the word "Jāv" in many manuscripts. Some manuscripts also mention the numbers 17, 18, and 21. The reading with 21 is appropriate because "18 female slaves of the country" is a well-known phrase in the Sutras, and three body types are mentioned: 1. *Kubja* (hunchback), 2. *Vakra* (bent), 3. *Vāmana* (dwarf).

The summary of the ninth *Uddesaka* is as follows: 1-5. Accept the *Rājapinda* (royal offering), eat it. Enter the inner palace, order food from within the inner palace. 6. The *Dvārāpāla* (gatekeeper) accepts the *Rājapinda* (royal offering) for animals, etc. 7. If one goes out for alms and does not receive information about the king's six locations even after 4-5 days, 8-9. If one takes even a single step with the intention of seeing the king or queen, 10. If one eats the king's food while he is away for hunting, etc., 11. If one goes for alms to the place where the king is eating, 12. If one stays where the king is staying, 13-18. If one eats the king's food while he is going or coming for war, travel, or a journey to the mountains or rivers, 19. If one goes to and fro during the commotion of the king's coronation, 20. If one goes to the ten major capitals more than once a month.

Navama Uddesaka
[195 21-25 - To consume food offered for the sake of the king's officials and employees, etc.
Such activities lead to Guruchaumasi Prāyaścitta.
Conclusion - This Navama Uddesaka describes the Prāyaścitta for various incidents related to the Rajapinda and the king.
Dasava. A. 3 states that consuming Rajapinda is an Anācāra, and the fifth Thāna of Thānaṅga mentions five exceptions for entering the king's inner chambers. Thus, the subject matter of the first three sūtras of this Uddesaka is found in other Āgamas. The remaining sūtras, from 4 to 27, discuss topics not mentioned in other Āgamas and their Prāyaścitta.
Therefore, this Uddesaka primarily deals with topics not mentioned in other Āgamas (24 sūtras), and the subject matter is related to a king. This is the unique characteristic of this Uddesaka.

## Tenth Uddeshak: Prāyaścitta for Disrespecting Ācārya etc.

1. A monk who speaks harshly to the Ācārya etc. or approves of someone who does so.
2. A monk who speaks to the Ācārya etc. in a way devoid of affection, or approves of someone who does so.
3. A monk who speaks harshly and without affection to the Ācārya etc. or approves of someone who does so.
4. A monk who commits any of the thirty-three pāśātanās of the Ācārya etc. or approves of someone who does so.

(Such a monk receives the Guru-Chaumāsi Prāyaścitta.)

**Discussion:**

The Ācārya etc. can be spoken to harshly or without affection regarding the following seventeen topics:

1. Jāti (caste)
2. Kula (family)
3. Rūpa (form)
4. Bhāṣā (language)
5. Dhana (wealth)
6. Bala (strength)
7. Pariyāya (circumstances)
8. Jasa (fame)
9. Tave (skill)
10. Lābha (profit)
11. Sat (truth)
12. Vaya (age)
13. Buddhi (intelligence)
14. Dhāraṇa (holding)
15. Uggha (excellence)
16. Sīla (conduct)
17. Samāyāri (agreement)

For example, to say explicitly to the Ācārya etc., "You are of a low caste," or to say sarcastically, "You are of a very high caste, I am of a low caste."

Similarly, one should understand this in relation to Kula, Rūpa etc.

**Āgādha:** A word that causes the inner kṣaya to manifest.

**Farusa:** A word devoid of affection and unpleasant, i.e., even if not spoken in anger, it is unpleasant to hear and stings the heart.

**Āgādha-Farusa:** Both harsh and unpleasant, a combination of both. 

Page #297:
---------------------------
## Tenth Uddeshak

[195] In these three sutras, the word "Bhadant" is used instead of "Pāyiriya". This encompasses all those who hold the titles of Acharya, Upadhyaya, etc., as well as gurus and Ratnadhikas. If this atonement was only for the Acharya, then the word "Pāyiriya" would have been used.

In the Asāyanā-Bhāṣya, the Dashaśruta-Skandha-Vaṇita describes 33 Asātanās and elaborates on them by dividing them into four categories: Dravya, Kshetra, Kāla, and Bhāva. There, many exceptions to Asātanās are also mentioned, such as:

1. If a guru is ill, one should not show them food that is not suitable for them, but should eat it themselves or give it to someone else without asking.
2. To walk ahead to remove thorns or other obstacles from the path.
3. To walk very close for support in a difficult place or when ill.
4. To sit close and touch for physical care.
5. To sit close during the recitation of the Chhedasutra so that an uninitiated Sadhu can hear.
6. If a householder's house is nearby, not to speak even when the guru calls out, or not to speak even if there is a possibility of conflict.
7. If the path is blocked by Sadhus, to answer from the same place.
8. If one is ill oneself or is engaged in the service of another who is ill, not to speak even when called.
9. Not to speak while excreting.
10. If one accidentally utters a Utsutrā-Prarūpaṇā to the guru, to say it discreetly or in private.
11. To use harsh language to stabilize the guru, etc., if their restraint is slackening.

Even if one engages in the above-mentioned Asātanās, the atonement mentioned in the sutras does not apply. This is because these actions are not motivated by Asātanā, but by proper discernment.

The atonement for eating food mixed with Anantakaaya is:

5. **Je Bhikkhu Anantakaaya-Sanjuttaṁ Āhāraṁ Āhārei, Āhāratṁ vā Sāijjai.**
5. **A monk who eats food mixed with Anantakaaya, or approves of someone who does so.**

(He receives the Guru-Chaumāsi atonement.)

The Vivechana Sutra mentions the atonement for eating food mixed with Anantakaaya, not pure Anantakaaya. This is because a monk does not knowingly eat Anantakaaya with intention. However, if pieces of edible roots mixed with Anantakaaya are present in the food and the monk is unaware of them, then eating such food is considered Anantakaaya-Sanjutta Āhāra. Alternatively, if the monk is unaware of the presence of Anantakaaya in an edible substance while picking it up, consuming it, and even while eating it, then this can also be considered Anantakaaya-Sanjutta Āhāra.

[Nishīthasūtra Anantakaaya - A plant that contains infinite living beings is called an Anantakaayika plant. Roots and flowers are forms of Anantakaaya, but the Paṇṇavaṇā and other Āgamas mention many other types of Anantakaaya. From the stem of a plant to its seed, there are eight divisions, and if they possess the characteristics of Anantakaaya, they can be considered Anantakaaya. The Āgamas mention some characteristics of Anantakaaya as follows:

-Paṇṇavaṇāsūtra, pada 1 sāraṁśa - 1. A plant from whose broken piece milk comes out. 2. A plant that has two flat divisions when broken by hand. 3. A plant whose division, when cut in a circular shape, shows particles like earth in the cut part. 4. A plant whose root, tuber, stem, and branch have thick bark. 5. A leaf that does not have veins (fibers) or joints. 6. A fruit that is not ṇālabaddha. 7. A sprout that is growing.
In this way, vegetables, leaves, etc. can also be Anantakaaya, and Paṇaga, Sewāl, Pāl, Lahsun, Kāndā, Gājar, Mūlā, Adarak, Haldi, Ratālu, Shakarakand, Arabi, and many aquatic plants are Anantakaaya. If their sentient parts or portions are present in an insentient diet, then it is fit for consumption. The atonement for consuming Prādhākarma food, etc.
6. Je bhikkhū āhākammāṁ bhujai, bhujantaṁ vā sāijjai.
6. A monk who consumes Prādhākarma food, clothing, and bedding, or approves of those who do so, (receives the Guruchaumāsi atonement).

## Tenth Uddeshak

[199 Discussion - "Ahakamma is the taking of food, and from this, karma is attached to the soul, or the soul is attached to karma." (This is Ahakamma)
2. "From the taking of Ahakamma, because a person who is in a pure state of restraint falls into impure states of restraint, again and again, this is called Bhava-Ahakamma."
3. "Bhava-Ahakamma is destroyed by the knowledge, vision, and conduct of the soul."
4. "Ahakamma, when it matures, becomes Parakamma, and the soul makes it its own, this is called Attakamma."

The commentator has explained the four meanings of Pradhaakarma:

1. Pradhaakarma is the taking of food, etc., which causes the soul to be covered by karma. Or, the soul is covered by karma.
2. Pradhaakarma is the taking of food, etc., which causes the soul to fall from pure states of restraint into impure states of restraint. Or, the soul repeatedly falls down.
3. Pradhaakarma is the taking of food, etc., which destroys the soul's qualities of Bhava, knowledge, vision, and conduct.
4. Pradhaakarma is the taking of food, etc., which results in the soul binding karma through the actions of a householder.

Types of Ahakamma:

"Ahakamma is of three types: Aahara, Uvadhi, and Vasheemaadi. Aahara-Ahakamma is of four types: Asana, Paana, Khaadya, and Swaadya. ||2663|| Uvadhi-Ahakamma is of two types: Vastra and Paatra. Vastra is of five types, and Paatra is of three types. ||2664|| Vashee-Ahakamma is of seven types each for the Moola-guna and Uttara-guna. ||2665||

1. Aahara-Pradhaakarma - There are four types: 1. Asana (food), 2. Paana (drink), 3. Khaadya (edible), 4. Swaadya (tasty).
2. Uvadhi-Pradhaakarma - There are two types: Vastra (clothing) and Paatra (utensils). Vastra is of five types, and Paatra is of three types. Other medicinal and auxiliary Uvadhi should be understood by implication.
3. Vashee-Pradhaakarma - There are seven types each for the Moola-guna (primary qualities) and Uttara-guna (secondary qualities) of the bed.

**Kalpya-Kalpyata of Ahakamma:**

Ahakamma-Aahara, created for the purpose of one or many Sadhus during the reign of the first and last Tirthankaras, is not Kalpya (permissible) for any Sadhu or Sadhvi. 

Page #300:
---------------------------
[200]
In the reign of the middle Tirthankaras, it is considered appropriate to accept food, etc., from a sadhu or sadhvi who does not have an objective. It is not considered appropriate to accept food, etc., from a sadhu or a sangha who has an objective.
There are two divisions of adhakarma:
1. Adhakarma is that food, etc., which has an objective for one or more sadhus.
2. Prauddeshik is that food, etc., which does not have an objective.
In the reign of the middle Tirthankaras, "adhakarma" is not acceptable. In the reign of the first and last Tirthankaras, both "adhakarma and prauddeshik" are not acceptable.
To explain the reason for this difference, the commentator has said that the reason is simplicity and complexity, and he has illustrated them with examples for both householders and sadhus.
Nimittakathan-Prayaschitta
7. A bhikkhu who speaks of a present nimitta or approves of the one who speaks of it.
8. A bhikkhu who speaks of a future nimitta or approves of the one who speaks of it.
(He is given the Guruchaumasi prayaschitta.)
Vivechan-Labh, Alabh, Sukh, Duhkha and Maran are the six types of nimitta. These six have three divisions each: past, present and future.
There are many reasons for telling nimitta, such as:
1. For the attainment of food, etc., 2. For fame, reputation or prestige, 3. For someone's sake, 4. For someone's benefit or out of compassion, etc.
There are many ways to tell nimitta, such as:
1. From the lines of the hand, from the lines of the feet, from the lines of the forehead, 2. From other signs of the body, 3. From the date, day or zodiac sign, 4. From the date of birth or birth chart, 5. From asking questions, etc.
Examples of present nimitta:
1. I have sent a certain person to a certain place, has he received a sum of money there or not? Is he coming or not? 2. Someone has gone abroad, is he alive or dead there? 

Page #301:
---------------------------
##  [The Twenty-First Objective]

[2013. Answering questions like "Am I happy or sad now?" with reference to the present moment is called a *nimitta* statement. 

Similarly, one should understand questions and answers related to future loss, gain, happiness, sorrow, birth, and death, all based on *nimitta*.

This section discusses the *guruchaumaasi* atonement for *nimitta* statements in the present and future. The *laghuchaumaasi* atonement for *nimitta* statements in the past is discussed in the thirteenth objective.

The prohibition of *nimitta* statements is mentioned in different ways in the *Praagamas*. Here are some examples:

1. "Those who practice *lakshana*, *suvijna*, and *angavidya* are not truly called *shramanas*, as the Tirthankaras have said." - *Uttara*. A. 8, G. 32
2. "Those who practice *lakshana* and *suvijna*, who are deeply involved in *nimitta* and *kautukakarya*, who earn a living through *prasrava*-filled knowledge that creates false wonder, cannot find refuge at the time of death." - *Uttara*. A. 20, G. 45
3. "One who leaves their own home and works in the homes of others, using *nimitta* to predict good and bad fortune and earn a living, is called a *papasramana*." - *Uttara*. A. 17, G. 18
4. "A monk who does not earn a living through *chhinna*, *sara*, *bhoom*, *antariksha*, *suvijna*, *lakshana*, *danda*, *vastuvidya*, *angviyar*, and *sarasvijaya* is a true monk." - *Uttara*. A. 15, G. 7
5. "Stars, dreams, *yoga*, *nimitta*, mantras, and medicines are not to be considered by householders, as they lead to worldly attachments." - *Dashava*. A. 8, G. 50

1. Those who practice *lakshana* (physiognomy), *suvijna* (dream interpretation), and *angavidya* (body science) are not truly called *shramanas* (ascetics), as the Tirthankaras have said.
2. Those who practice *lakshana* and *suvijna*, who are deeply involved in *nimitta* (omens) and *kautukakarya* (curiosity-driven activities), who earn a living through *prasrava*-filled knowledge that creates false wonder, cannot find refuge at the time of death.
3. One who leaves their own home and works in the homes of others, using *nimitta* to predict good and bad fortune and earn a living, is called a *papasramana* (sinful ascetic).
4. A monk who does not earn a living through *chhinna* (cutting), *sara* (voice), *bhoom* (earth), *antariksha* (space), *suvijna* (dream interpretation), *lakshana* (physiognomy), *danda* (punishment), *vastuvidya* (architecture), *angviyar* (body tremors), and *sarasvijaya* (victory over the senses) is a true monk.
5. Stars, dreams, *yoga*, *nimitta*, mantras, and medicines are not to be considered by householders, as they lead to worldly attachments.

---------------------------
## Nishīthসূত্র 5

**Nishīthসূত্র 5**
5. Stars, dreams, methods of controlling others, omens, mantras, and medicines - these are all places where beings are harmed, therefore a Muni should not tell householders about their results.
Telling about omens violates the Jina's teachings.
A seeker becomes agitated by the practice of restraint. He becomes the cause of blameworthy actions.
Telling about omens has the potential to cause many evils.
[202]

**Sūtrakṛtāṅgasūtra A. 12, G. 10** states that "many omens are true at times, and false at other times." This causes the reputation of the Sadhu and the second great vow to be tarnished.

**Penance for Stealing a Disciple**
9. A monk who steals another's disciple, or approves of the stealing.
10. A monk who changes the feelings of another's disciple, or approves of the changing. (He is given the Guru-Chaumasi penance.)

**Discussion:** There are two types of disciples: 1. Dīkṣita (Sadhu) and 2. Dīkṣārthī (Vairaagi). The following sutras refer to Dīkṣārthī, therefore here we should understand Dīkṣita Sadhu.

**Stealing:** To make another's disciple favorable, i.e., to attract him, to give him food, to teach him, and to take him away, send him away, or hide him.

**Changing Feelings:** To criticize the disciple or the Guru by pointing out their faults, and to praise oneself by highlighting one's own virtues. To point out the disadvantages of staying with another, and to point out the benefits of staying with oneself, thereby changing the disciple's feelings.

**Difference between Changing Feelings and Stealing:** 1. **Stealing:** To take away by attracting.
2. **Changing Feelings:** To create faith in oneself and change the disciple's thoughts, so that he leaves his own Guru.

The commentator has elaborated on changing feelings through thirteen doors, and has described in detail how, with the body, speech, and mind, one can criticize and condemn, both when asked and without being asked.

**Penance for Stealing a Direction**
11. A monk who steals a direction, or approves of the stealing.
12. A monk who changes a direction, or approves of the changing. 

Page #303:
---------------------------
##  Chapter 10: The Tenth Uddeshak

**11. A monk who abducts the direction of a newly initiated disciple or approves of such an act.**

**12. A monk who alters the direction of a newly initiated disciple or approves of such an act. (He incurs Guruchaumasi Prāyaścitta.)**

**Explanation:** "Direction" refers to the Acharya or Upadhyaya designated by the Acharya or Upadhyaya during the time of initiation or the time of the larger initiation.  Abducting the direction means abandoning that Acharya or Upadhyaya and accepting another Acharya or Upadhyaya.  (This applies to a Sadhvi and her Pravartini.)  - Churni

**Meaning:** During the time of initiation or the larger initiation, the newly initiated disciple is given the guidance of a specific Acharya or Upadhyaya. This is called their "direction."  To remove the disciple from the guidance of that Acharya or Upadhyaya and place them under the guidance of another Acharya or Upadhyaya is called abducting their direction.

Similarly, for a Sadhvi, to direct her to a different Pravartini than the one she was originally assigned is called abducting her direction.

Abduction involves directly placing the disciple under the guidance of another Acharya or Upadhyaya, while alteration involves changing the disciple's thoughts and beliefs.

Sutras 9-10 deal with the Prāyaścitta for abducting or altering the direction of a previously initiated disciple, while Sutras 11-12 deal with the Prāyaścitta for abducting or altering the direction of a newly initiated disciple.

Abduction and alteration are two distinct actions that relate to the individual. Therefore, "Seh" refers to the initiated disciple, and "Dis" refers to the direction, which is the one who is directed, meaning the newly initiated disciple. Therefore, "Dis" should be understood as the abduction and alteration of the newly initiated disciple.

**Prāyaścitta for Sheltering an Unknown Monk**

**13. A monk who shelters a monk from another Gachchha who has arrived alone without inquiring about him for more than three days, or approves of such an act.** (He incurs Guruchaumasi Prāyaścitta.)

**Explanation:** If the arriving monk is known, then one should inquire about the reason for his arrival. If he is unknown, then one should inquire about where he came from, where he wants to go, etc., and obtain complete information before acting accordingly. Because an unknown person could be a thief, a cheat, a hater, a criminal of the king, a fornicator, a seeker of loopholes, a murderer, or a provocateur.

Even with a known person, it is necessary to inquire as a matter of courtesy. As far as possible, one should obtain information on the same day. Due to illness or other reasons, this may not be possible... 

Page #304:
---------------------------
##  204]

If it is not possible to perform the Nisith Sutra, then one should not violate the third day, otherwise they become liable for atonement. 
It is the duty of the Gachchhanayak or the leading monk there, and they are the ones who are liable for atonement. 
The incoming monk may come for criticism (purification), for gaining knowledge, for the work of the Sangha, or for ordination. 
Failure to inquire may lead to a change in their faith, disgrace, etc. Therefore, the leading monk should diligently perform this duty. 

**Atonement for eating with a monk who has been punished by conflict**

14. A monk who has not calmed down, has not performed atonement, who eats with him without inquiry or even after inquiry, or approves of those who eat with him, is liable for Guruchaumasi atonement.

**Discussion:**

The Brihatkalpa Sutra Uddeshak 4 states that if a monk has a conflict with another monk, they should not go out for any work, including Gochari, without calming down or performing atonement for criticism. 

This atonement sutra implies that if a monk who has been punished by conflict does not calm down or accept atonement even after inquiry, then one cannot have any dealings with them, including eating, after three days. 

Those who exchange food with them after three days are liable for atonement. 

Here, the commentator has mentioned many reasons for the origin of conflict and also many ways to calm down the monk who has not calmed down. 
The many harms that result from neglecting these methods are explained with an interesting example. 

**Atonement for saying and giving the opposite atonement**

15. A monk who gives a higher atonement for a lower atonement, or approves of those who do so. 
16. A monk who gives a lower atonement for a higher atonement, or approves of those who do so. 
17. A monk who gives a higher atonement for a lower atonement, or approves of those who do so. 
18. A monk who gives a lower atonement for a higher atonement, or approves of those who do so.

[205 15. A monk who calls the minor penance a major penance or approves of someone who does so.
16. A monk who calls the major penance a minor penance or approves of someone who does so.
17. A monk who gives the major penance for a minor penance or approves of someone who does so.
18. A monk who gives the minor penance for a major penance or approves of someone who does so. (He incurs the Guru Chaumasik penance.)
Discussion - The penance is mentioned for doing the opposite in two sutras and the penance is mentioned for giving less or more penance due to attachment-aversion or ignorance.
Giving more penance causes pain to the sadhu, he is compassionate and the critic does not criticize again due to fear.
Giving less penance does not lead to complete purification and there is a possibility of repeating the fault. Therefore, the authority giving penance should be careful not to give the opposite penance.
Penance for eating with a monk who is eligible for penance
19. A monk who, having heard or known that a monk is undergoing a minor penance, eats with him or approves of someone who does so.
20. A monk who, having heard or known the reason for a minor penance, eats with him or approves of someone who does so.
21. A monk who, having heard or known the resolve of a minor penance, eats with him or approves of someone who does so.
22. A monk who, having heard or known that a monk is undergoing a major penance, eats with him or approves of someone who does so.
23. A monk who, having heard or known the reason for a major penance, eats with him or approves of someone who does so.
24. A monk who, having heard or known the resolve of a major penance, eats with him or approves of someone who does so.

[Nishīthasūtra 23. A monk who, upon hearing or knowing the reason for the Guru Prāyaścitta, maintains a relationship with that sadhu, including sharing food, or approves of those who do so.
24. A monk who, upon hearing or knowing the intention of the Guru Prāyaścitta, maintains a relationship with that sadhu, including sharing food, or approves of those who do so. (He is subject to the Guru Chaumāsi Prāyaścitta.) Discussion - 1. Ugghaīyaṁ ti pāyaścittaṁ vahatassa,

3. sankappaṁ - until the day on which the Prāyaścitta is established.
From the time of performing the Prāyaścitta until the completion of the penance performed for the purpose of the Prāyaścitta, it is forbidden to exchange food with that sadhu.
The specific method of penance to be performed for the Prāyaścitta eliminates all normal interactions with the one performing the Prāyaścitta. However, here, the prohibition of food exchange in the previous stage is stated in three parts, and is called Prāyaścitta.
Three sūtras mention the Prāyaścitta related to Udghatika, and three sūtras mention the Prāyaścitta related to Anudghātika.
The Chūrṇikāra, at the beginning of the explanation of these sūtras, has said, "ete chaḥ sutā." After that, the meaning of the words Udghatika, etc., has been explained. Nevertheless, these six sūtras have sometimes become twelve sūtras, which are found in all available copies. It is possible that the basis for the increase may be the bhang mentioned in the Chani of Bhāṣya Gāthā 2887. There, it is clarified that there are only 6 sūtras. The Saṁyogasūtra should be made from these 6, whose number is 55. Prāyaścitta for Sunrise-Sunset Violation
25. A monk who, while performing the Uggaya-Vitti, with an unrighteous intention, in a state of confusion, with the intention of violating the Samavāṇa, takes food, drink, or something to eat or drink for himself, should know this: "As the sun rises or sets," whatever is in the mouth, in the hand, or in the possession, should be discarded, for whoever eats it or feeds the eater, will not be free from sin.

A monk who, with a firm resolve and without any doubt, takes food, drink, edibles, or savories, knowing that the sunrise has not occurred or the sunset has already happened, and while eating, finds that the food is in his mouth, hand, or vessel, should discard it, cleanse his mouth, hands, and vessel, and should not be considered to have violated the Jain code. However, one who consumes the remaining food or approves of the consumption of the remaining food, is considered to have violated the Jain code.

However, one who consumes the remaining food or approves of the consumption of the remaining food, is considered to have violated the Jain code.
25. A monk resolves to take food only after sunrise and before sunset. If a capable monk, without any doubt, takes food, drink, edibles, or savories, and while eating, finds that the sunrise has not occurred or the sunset has already happened, and the food is in his mouth, hand, or vessel, he should discard it, cleanse his mouth, hands, and vessel, and should not be considered to have violated the Jain code.

[Nishith Sutra
2. A Samarth Sadhu takes food with doubt. 3. An Asamarth Sadhu takes food without doubt.
4. An Asamarth Sadhu takes food with doubt. Charinkara says:

3. Abbadihehi karanehi anidhe aicche sanka bhavati-kim udito anudito ti. Athamanakale vi kim suro dharati na va ti sanka bhavati. (So vitigicchaao).

3. Badal adi karanon se surya ke nahin dikhne par shanka hoti hai ki suryoday hua ya nahin athava suryaast ke samay surya hai ya ast ho gaya, aisi shanka hoti hai.
4. Bele, tele adi tap se ashakta bana hua, rugnata se durbal sharir wala ya lambe vihar mein aahar ke alabh se kshudhatur bhikshu asansthrita kahalata hai.
While travelling, if there is no possibility of getting food ahead and the village where the night rest was taken, almost all the people are going to the fields etc. in the morning, then even a Samarth (healthy) Sadhu can go to take food. Similarly, if there is no possibility of getting food etc. the next day, then the occasion of bringing alms in the evening may arise.
For an Asamarth (weak), such occasions are easily possible.
Sometimes, due to clouds or mountains etc., there may be an impression that the sunrise has happened or the sunset has not happened. Then, after a while, the correct situation comes to the fore.
_ If, in a doubtful or non-doubtful situation, after taking food, it is decided that the sunrise has not happened or the sunset has happened, or if the sunrise has happened after taking food, then that food is not considered fit for the Sadhu to eat. If eaten, the fault of night food is incurred and he has to perform the atonement of Guruchaumasi. Therefore, whether the food is in the food vessel or in the hand or in the mouth, it should be discarded and the hands etc. should be washed with water. Atonement for swallowing the vomit
29. If a Bhikshu vomits up the food he has eaten, whether in the day or at night, and swallows it again, or swallows it again, he incurs a sin. 

Page #309:
---------------------------
##  [The 209th Objective]

[A monk who, after food or water has come up to his mouth during the night or the twilight, swallows it again or approves of the one who swallows it. (He incurs the Guruchaumasi Pratikraman.)]

**Discussion:**  One may experience Udgal (regurgitation) during the day, night, or twilight due to overeating. If the Udgal comes up to the throat and returns, there is no Pratikraman. However, if it comes to the mouth and is swallowed, the monk incurs Pratikraman, but not if it is swallowed during the day.

The commentator (Bhashya, Churnikar) has explained this with the example of a drop of water on a hot 'tava' (griddle), that the monk should eat such a limited amount of food that it is completely digested by the digestive fire, and no digestive disorder occurs.

This sutra encourages the observance of subtle rules related to nighttime meals.

The Agamkaras have considered swallowing Udgal as nighttime food. Therefore, it is called Guruchaumasi Pratikraman.

**Pratikraman for negligence in the service of the sick**

30. A monk who, having heard or known about a sick monk, does not find out his whereabouts or approves of the one who does not find out.

31. A monk who, having heard or known about a sick monk, leaves the path leading to the sick monk and goes by another path or by the same path (the one he came from) or approves of the one who does so.

32. A monk who, being present in the service of the sick, does not express regret to the sick monk when his own benefit does not allow him to serve the sick, or approves of the one who does not do so.

33. A monk who, being present in the service of the sick, does not tell the sick monk when he does not get the appropriate medicine, diet, etc., or approves of the one who does not do so. (He incurs the Guruchaumasi Pratikraman.)

**Discussion:** 1. If one receives information about a sick person who needs service, one should obtain complete information and go to serve him. 

Page #310:
---------------------------
[210]
[Nishīthasūtra 2. But if the sick monk knows the village or place, he should not go elsewhere out of a feeling of not serving, and should not return by the same route by which he came.
3. If the necessary materials for the sick are not available or not available in full quantity, then one should express regret by taking the blame for not getting it on oneself for his satisfaction.
4. Even if medicine or diet is not found on investigation, one should not engage in other work or sit anywhere, but first inform the sick that "even after so much investigation, the necessary item has not been found or is likely to be found after some time."
In the Āgama, Vaiyāvṛtya is called Prābhāntara Tapa. Therefore, the Sadhu should consider it as his work of self-purification and should think that this sick person is doing a favor to me, giving me the opportunity of easy Prābhāntara Tapa. By serving in this way, considering it as a favor, there is great Nirjarā. In Uttarādhyayana Sūtra A. 29, it is said that the best benefit of the Tīrthankara position is obtained from service. In Sūtrakṛtāṅga Sūtra Śru. 1 A. 3 Udd. 3 and 4, instructions have been given to serve the sick monk without any feeling of being sick.
Penance for wandering during the rainy season

34. The monk who wanders from village to village in the first rainy season or approves of the one who wanders.
35. The monk who wanders from village to village after performing Paryuṣaṇa during the rainy season or approves of the one who wanders. (He gets Gurucaumāsi penance.)
Discussion: The monk should wander in the eight months of Hemant and Grīṣma and should not wander in the four months of the rainy season. As

-Bṛhatkalpa 0 U. 1, Sū. 36-37 These two sūtras describe twelve months, in which the time of Vārṣāvāsa-Cāturmās is counted as four months. The statement of the months of the birth etc. of Tīrthankara Bhagavān Mahāvīra is as follows
Gimmāṇam Cauṭthe Māse Aṭṭhame Pakkhe Āsāḍhasuddhe Vāsāvāṣāṇam Tacce Māse Pancame Pakkhe Āsoyabahule Hemantāṇam Paḍhame Māse Paḍhame Pakkhe Migasarabahule. -Ācā 0 Śru. 2, A. 15

It is clear from these texts that the rainy season, winter, and summer are each four months long. The division of twelve months is also done in this way in the sutras related to the method, prohibitions, and atonement related to the acceptance of clothes.
No Kappi Nigganthaan wa Nigganthiin wa Padham-Samosaranuddesapattaai chelai Padiggahetttae. Kappi Nigganthaan wa Nigganthiin wa Dochchsamosaranuddesapattaai chelai Padiggahetttae.

Vitiyam Samosaranam Udubaddham, Tam Paduchch Vasavaasoggaho Padhamsamosaranam Bhannati.   Nishit Chuni Uo 10, Pri 158
In these sutras, the four-month rainy season is called the first samvasaran, and the eight-month seasonal period is called the second samvasaran. Thus, the twelve months are divided into two samvasarans.
Ah Pun Evam Janijja - Chattari Maasa Vaasaavaasaanam Viikkant.
Pracha 0 Shro 2, 03, Uo 1
This text also mentions only four months for the Chaturmas. Therefore, the rainy season (Chaturmas) is four months long, and this clear decision is made from the above sutra texts.
The verb used for "staying for Chaturmas" is as follows:
Sevam Gachcha No Gaamanugaman Duijjezza Tao Sanjayamev Vaasaavaasan Uvalliezza. Tahappgaaram Gaamam wa Jav Raayhaani wa No Vaasaavaasan Uvalliezza. Tahappgaaram Gaamam wa Jav Raayhaani wa Tao Sanjayamev Vaasaavaasan Uvalliezza.
- Acha 0 Shro 2, A 3, Uo 1
In these sutras, the verb 'Uvalliezza' is used for staying for four months. The use of the verbs Pajjosavana and Pajjosave is
Je Bhikkhu Apajjosavanaae Pajjosavei, Pajjosaventam wa Saizzjai.
Je Bhikkhu Pajjosavanaae Na Pajjosavei Na Pajjosaventam wa Saizzjai.
Je Bhikkhu Pajjosavanaae Ittariyampi Aharam Aaharei, Aharatam wa Saizzjai.
In these sutras, the verb 'Pajjosavei' is used for the Samvatsari and for doing the Samvatsari. 
- Nishit Uo 10, Suo 36-38

[212]
The Nishītha Sūtra and the Ṭhānāṅga Sūtra (A. 5 U. 2 Su. 2) both mention the reasons for observing the Cāturmās in two divisions. The first division is called 'Paḍhama Pauṣammi' and the second division is called 'Vāsavāsaṁ Pajjoṣaviyansi'.

Both divisions mention five different reasons for observing the Cāturmās. These two divisions are specific to the Cāturmās, as observing the Cāturmās is considered to be a possibility in the remaining eight months. Exceptions are only possible in the impossible.

Similar to these Sūtras in the Ṭhānāṅga Sūtra, Sūtras 34-35 also mention the two divisions of the Cāturmās and state that they are for atonement.

The use of the verb 'Pajjoṣavei' has been explained above for performing the Samvatsarī. Therefore, it is appropriate to understand these two divisions as follows: the first division is before the Samvatsarī and the second division is after the Samvatsarī (Paryuṣaṇa).

The statement about observing the Cāturmās for atonement and the reasons for observing it are more appropriate for the four months of the Cāturmās (Varṣavās). The words 'Paḍhama Pauṣammi' and 'Vāsavāsaṁ Pajjoṣaviyansi' in Sūtras 34-35 and the Ṭhānāṅga Sūtra, therefore, should be understood as 'in the first division of the Pauṣa (rainy season)' and 'after performing the Paryuṣaṇa (Samvatsarī) during the Varṣavās'.

This interpretation is also appropriate from the perspective of tradition. The Bhagavati Sūtra mentions that Lord Mahāvīra observed the Cāturmās and performed the four-month fast. Since then, for the past 2500 years, people have generally observed the four-month Varṣavās.

Therefore, the verb 'Pajjoṣaviyansi' that comes with 'Vāsavās' in the Nishītha and Ṭhānāṅga Sūtra refers to the Paryuṣaṇa. Only by accepting this interpretation is there consistency in the meaning.

The commentator and the Chūrṇikāra have stated that the first season is the Prāvṛṭ season. There is a provision for atonement for observing the Cāturmās in this season. They have also stated that the meaning of 'Dūijjai' is that the monk travels in two seasons (winter and summer), hence the verb 'Dūijjai'.

The three divisions of the Samvatsar are Hemant, Grīṣma, and Varṣakāla, and the six divisions are Prāvṛṭ, etc. Even if there is a change in the natural cycle or a month is added or removed, there is no change in the months mentioned in the calculation of these divisions.

Atonement for not observing the Paryuṣaṇa during the Paryuṣaṇa period
36. Je Bhikku Pajjoṣavaṇāe ṇ Pajjoṣavei ṇ Pajjoṣarvatam vā Saijjai. 37. Je Bhikku Apajjoṣavaṇāe Pajjoṣavei Pajjoṣarvatam vā Saijjai.

36. A monk who does not observe the Paryuṣaṇa (Samvatsarī) on the day of the Paryuṣaṇa or approves of someone who does not observe it.

[213
37. A monk who observes Paryushana on a day other than the designated day or encourages others to do so, (incurs Guruchaumasi Pratikraman).
Discussion – Chaturmas Varshavas is a four-month period, as explained earlier. These two sutras mention Paryushana. This Paryushana is for one day, which is also certain. Therefore, these two sutras mention the pratikraman for not observing Paryushana on that day and observing it on another day.
There is no clear statement in the Agamas regarding this day, yet the pratikraman vidhan in these two sutras indicates the definite day of Sanvatsari.
While explaining these sutras, the Churni of Gatha 3146 and Gatha 3153 mentions Bhadva Sudi Panchami, and the explanation of Gatha 3152-53 also mentions 1 month 20 days. The same statement is also found in the 70th Samavay. Therefore, the implication is that the pratikraman mentioned in the sutras is incurred for observing Paryushana on any day other than this day, and the date of Bhadva Sudi Panchami is fixed for that day.
It is said that Kalkaacharya observed the Sanvatsari on the fourth day at the request of the Shaatvahan king, and since then, the Sanvatsari is observed on the fourth day.
1
Any Geetarth or Agamvihary Muni can decide to take the path of exception due to circumstances. Upon the end of the Pravaadic situation, they perform the appropriate pratikraman and accept the conduct mentioned in the sutras again. No Geetarth or Agamvihary has the right to establish a tradition contrary to the sutras for the exception taken due to circumstances. Therefore, it is possible that the former Kalkaacharya may have observed the Sanvatsari on the fourth day at the request of a king of a country, but it is not appropriate for them to establish or allow a tradition. Because making an exceptional conduct into a regular conduct is a crime. Therefore, according to the above statement, changing the time of Sanvatsari cannot be considered appropriate.
1
The day mentioned in the Gam is definitely Bhadva Sudi Panchami, and it remains so. Observing Paryushana on any day other than that incurs pratikraman, this is the meaning of these two sutras.
Even today, Rishi Panchami is written on this day in the Panchangs. This can be determined by looking at the Panchangs of the last 10-20 years.
If the entire Jain Sangha accepts the decision to observe Paryushana (Sanvatsari) on the day of Rishi Panchami written in the Panchangs, abandoning their own prejudices, then both the Agama tradition and uniformity can be maintained.
The name "Rishi Panchami" also indicates this meaning, the festival day of the Rishis-Munis. This word "Rishi" includes all Sadhus, Jain and non-Jain. The Jain Agamas also use the word "Rishi" for Sadhu.
Hundreds (1200-1300) years ago, the Geetarth Acharyas decided to celebrate all festival days according to the worldly Panchang, such as - 

Page #314:
---------------------------
[214]
[Nishith Sutra] Due to the irregularity of time, the knowledge of the movements of the planets, days of the week, constellations, and the correct determination of festivals and tithis has been lost. Therefore, in determining festivals and tithis, there is a contradiction. Knowing this, all the Gītartha Ācāryas have accepted that the "worldly calendar is also according to the Āgama" and have accepted the determination of festivals and tithis from it.
Therefore, the entire Jain community should accept the decision to celebrate the last day of the Paksha and Chaturmas, i.e., Amavasya, Purnima as Pakkhi, Chaumasi festival, and Rishi Panchami as the Samvatsari Mahotsav as per the worldly calendar. Doing so will not incur the prāyaścitta mentioned in the sūtras and will also follow the correct decision of many Gītartha Pūrva Ācāryas.
The prāyaścitta for keeping hair and eating on the day of Paryushana is as follows:
38. The monk who keeps hair as fine as cow hair on the day of Paryushana (Samvatsari) or approves of it.
39. The monk who eats even a little food on the day of Paryushana (Samvatsari) or approves of it. (He incurs the Guru Chaumasi prāyaścitta.)
Discussion - The duties of a monk regarding Paryushana:
1. If a suitable place for Varshavas is not found and Chaturmas is not established, then Chaturmas should be established on this day.
2. If the request to keep the bed and bedding taken for the seasonal period until the end of Chaturmas has not been made, then it should be done on this day.
3. Even if there are hairs as fine as cow hair on the head or beard, they should be removed. Because hairs as fine as cow hair can be grasped and removed.
4. On the day of Samvatsari, one should completely abstain from all four types of food, i.e., observe a Chavivihar fast.
If these duties are not performed, the monk is liable for prāyaścitta. Performing these duties is called purifying Paryushana.
In addition, one should contemplate the restraint and transgression of the whole year, observe the loss and gain, criticize, perform pratikramna and ask for forgiveness, and thus make the soul peaceful and healthy.

##  [215
Tenth Uddeshak]
This is the day of Paryushana for the purpose of awakening specific Dharma, such as maintaining the results of Vardhamana. The importance of this day for the soul lies in the observance of these duties. The word "Paryushana" is used in the Agam for this day. In the Shwetambar tradition, the eighth day, which includes seven days of prior sadhana, is called Paryushana, and this day is called "Samvatsari." But in reality, the day of Samvatsari is the Paryushana day as mentioned in the Agam. The remaining days are like a prelude to Paryushana. In the Digambar tradition, there is a practice of performing Dharma-aradhana for ten days after the day of Paryushana. Over time, the Samvatsari festival has come to be celebrated on the tenth day (Anant Chaturdashi).
##  Penance for reciting Paryushana Kalp to householders
40.  Je Bhikkhu Annautthiyan va Garathiyan va Pajjosavei, Pajjosaventam va Saijzai.
40.  A monk who recites Paryushana Kalp (sadhu-samachari) to a non-Jain or a householder, or approves of someone who does so. (He incurs Guruchaumasi penance.)
##  Discussion
"Non-Jain and householder" should be understood as eight types of householders, which have been explained in Sutra 15 of the first Uddeshak.
The name of the sixth study of Dasha Shruta Skandha is "Pajjosavana Kapp." It contains the statement of the sadhu-samachari during the rainy season.
On the day of Paryushana, all sadhus should perform the evening Pratikraman and collectively recite or listen to the "Pajjosavana Kapp" study, and follow the sadhu-samachari mentioned therein during the rainy season and other times.
Churna says - 'Pajjosavana Kapp Kahane Ima Samayari' - 'Appano Uvassaaye Paadosaye Avasaye Kaye Kalam Ghetttu (record the time) Kale Suddhe Patthaveta Kahijjati..... . Savve Sahuu Sampayaniyam Kaussaggham Karenti.... ''
The method of recording the time of self-study, listening to this study, and then performing the Kayotsarga at the end, etc., is described in Churni.
The present Sutra states that reciting the "Paryushana Kalp - study" to householders or in a sadhu-parishad with householders is a penance. Therefore, the practice is to recite and listen to it only in the sadhu-parishad at night.
This tradition of the "Pajjosavana Kapp" study has been discontinued since an unknown time.
At the time of the composition of the Dasha Shruta Skandha, its appointment, etc., explanations, this study was complete in its place. After that, it is possible that in the 13th-14th century, it was abridged and added to the present well-known Kalpasutra. And some copyist has written the entire Kalpasutra in place of this study. This has resulted in the loss of the true form of this study. Many texts have been interpolated in the description of Tirthankaras, the list of elders, and the original samachari, which can be clearly understood by studying the appointment and its Churni. 

Page #316:
---------------------------
[216]
The 'Pajjosavaṇakappa' section of the Nishīthasūtra Kālika Daśāśruta Skandha Sūtra is forbidden to be recited to householders. Yet, it has been combined with the Uttkālika (Chulla) Kalpasūtra, etc., and a new Kalpasūtra compilation has been made and recited in the afternoon (Uttkāla) in front of householders.
This study is currently in a distorted state. Its originality, as well as the pure tradition associated with it, has been severed. As a result, the meaning and penance tradition of this Prāyaścitta Sūtra 40 has also been almost severed.
Penance for accepting clothes during the rainy season
41. If a monk accepts clothes after the beginning of the Chaturmas period, or approves of someone who does so, he incurs the Guru Chaturmas penance.
The use of these 41 Sūtra-stated places incurs the Guru Chaturmas penance.
Discussion - The terms 'Prathama Samavasarana' and 'Dvitiya Samavasarana' are used in the Āgama for the Chaturmas period and the seasonal period, respectively. The arrival of a monk in a village, etc., is called Samavasarita. That arrival is of two types - arrival for the seasonal period and arrival for the Chaturmas period. This period of arrival is called 'Samavasarana'. It has two divisions, hence the terms Prathama and Dvitiya Samavasarana are etymologically correct.
In the Brihatkalpasutra Uddesaka 3, Sūtra 16, there is a prohibition against accepting clothes during Chaturmas, and this Sūtra states the penance for it.
The word 'Pattai' is in the Sūtra. Both commentators have interpreted it as 'Prāptāni' and created 'Patt' 'Apatt' areas and time violations.
The word 'Pattai' also has the meaning of 'vessel', but according to the structure of the Sūtra, the meaning 'Prāptāni' is appropriate. Because if there are two things to be stated, the Āgamakar uses the word 'vā', for example - 'Vatttham vā Padiggham vā'.
Therefore, this Sūtra only mentions clothes, yet the commentators have prohibited the acceptance of all equipment during Chaturmas, and have also clarified which and how many additional and necessary items should be accepted before Chaturmas.
Summary Sūtra 1-4 of the Uddesaka - Speak harsh, rough, or both words to the Acharya or Ratnaadhika Shraman, and make any kind of request.

**Discussion:**

The Praachana Shruta 2, Pra. 6, U. 1 and the Thaananga Sutra Pra. 3 prescribe three types of vessels for acceptance and use by monks and nuns: 
1. Copper vessels, 
2. Wooden vessels, 
3. Clay vessels.

Many other Agamas also describe these three types of vessels. The Praachana A. 2, A. 6, U. 1 mentions the acceptance of vessels made of iron and other materials, as well as vessels with bands made of iron and other materials. 

Page #320:
---------------------------
## 220]
[Nishith Sutra]
The use of iron and other similar vessels is prohibited. The four sutras presented here describe the atonement for accepting such vessels.

The Acharangasutra prohibits the acceptance of vessels made of iron, leather, and other similar materials, and describes them as being valuable.

Wooden, earthen, and gourd vessels are indicative of the humility of a monk. The Bhagavati Sutra, Chapter 3, Verse 1, describes the acceptance of wooden vessels by Talitas. The Uvvaiyasutra, in its description of ascetics and wanderers, mentions that they should only have three types of vessels: wooden, earthen, and gourd, and prohibits the use of many types of vessels.

Wooden, earthen, and gourd vessels are inexpensive and common, so there is no fear of them being stolen. Wooden and gourd vessels are also lightweight.

Iron and other similar vessels are heavy and valuable, hence their prohibition and atonement.

In the present day, monks and nuns also use plastic vessels. Plastic is considered to be made from a combination of wood and resin. Plastic vessels are lighter and cheaper than wooden vessels. They do not have the same disadvantages as iron vessels. However, they are not suitable for holding and consuming all types of food. Therefore, they are not as useful as the wooden, earthen, and gourd vessels prescribed by the scriptures.

Therefore,

The Acharangasutra mentions 17 types of prohibited vessels, which are generally the same in all manuscripts. However, the list mentioned in the present atonement sutra varies in different manuscripts, i.e., there are some differences in the order and names.

In many manuscripts of the Nishith Sutra, a total of 22 names are mentioned, of which 12 names are common in all manuscripts and 10 names are present in some manuscripts but not in others.

The twelve names are as follows:

1. Shray-payani, 2. Tamb-payani, 3. Tauy-payani, 4. Suvanna-payani, 5. Kans-payani, 6. Mani-payani, 7. Dant-payani, 8. Sing-payani, 9. Sankh-payani, 10. Chamm-payani, 11. Chel-payani, 12. Vahir-payani.

The ten names are as follows:

1. Sisag-payani, 2. Rupp-payani, 3. Jayaruv-payani, 4. Kanag-payani, 5. Hiranna-payani, 6. Ririy-payani, 7. Harpud-payani, 8. Kay-payani, 9. Sel-payani, 10. Ank-payani.

The Nishith Churni mentions four to five names and explains one or two words. The Acharangasutra commentary only explains one word and mentions its name. Therefore, there is no definitive solution to these textual variations. 

Page #321:
---------------------------
## Translation:

[221
rai Uddeshak]

Understanding the impurities that have entered the text over time, seventeen names have been accepted in the original text according to the uniform text of the Acharanga Sutra (17), which are also available in one copy of the Nisitha Sutra and also 17 names are found in the Prashnavyakaran Sutra. Five names have been omitted, which are as follows: 1. Rupp-Payani, 2. Jayaruva-Payani, 3. Kanag-Payani, 4. Ank-Payani, 5. Vaier-Payani.

There are three reasons for omitting these:

1. These five are not in the Acharanga Sutra.
2. These five are also not found in any copy of the Prashnavyakaran Sutra.
3. "Rupp" is included in "Hirann", "Jayaruva and Kanag" in "Suvann" and "Ank and Vaier" in "Harpud". The meaning of Harpud is as follows:

"Harpudam naam ayam adyaah patravisheshah mauktikalataabhirrupshobhithah."
- Ni. Chu. U. 11, Su. 1

Meaning: Special vessels made of iron etc. (gold-silver etc.), which are adorned with pearls etc., i.e., vessels made of iron, gold, silver etc. studded with pearls-gems etc. should be understood as Harpud vessels. Ank and Vajra are also a type of special gems. Therefore, they should be understood under the Harpud vessel.

Many available copies have six sutras of vessel atonement. But the Churnikar has explained four sutras by indicating the number as follows:

"Prathamasutre swayameva karanam kajjai. Dvitiyasutre anyakrutasyadharanam.
Tritiyasutre ayam adibhih swayameva bandham karoti. Chaturthasutre anyena ayam adibhirbandham dharayati."

The Churnikar has not mentioned the third and sixth sutras, but has indicated four sutras. Therefore, only four sutras have been accepted in the original text.

The intention of making vessels of iron etc. oneself should be understood as making them fit for one's own use. But originally, it is not possible for a Sadhu to make them.
- Ni. Churni.
It is clear that

"Binding iron etc. wires on wooden etc. vessels or making the edges of glass etc. by attaching it to the edges of the vessel all around", should be understood as binding them.

Keeping and using such vessels or vessels with these bindings is called wearing them.

In one copy of the Nisitha Sutra, similar to the Acharanga Sutra, the text "Pranayarani va thappagarani payaim karei, karentam va saijjai" is found, but it is not found in the Churni commentary or in many copies. Therefore, that word has not been kept. Nevertheless, since it is prohibited in the Acharanga, this atonement should be understood for making and keeping other such vessels as well.

---------------------------
##  Nishith Sutra

**[222]**

The third and sixth sutras, which were not accepted in the original, are as follows:

**3.**  A monk who consumes food or drinks offered in a vessel made of iron or leather, or approves of such consumption, incurs a sin.

**6.** A monk who consumes food or drinks offered in a vessel made of iron or leather, or approves of such consumption, incurs a sin.

For information on the atonement for accepting vessels made of iron, etc., as mentioned in the sutra, and the potential faults associated with it, please refer to the commentary.

**Atonement for Violating the Half-Yojana Limit for Vessels**

**5.** A monk who goes beyond half a yojana to obtain a vessel, or approves of such a journey, incurs a sin.

**6.** A monk who accepts a vessel brought from beyond the half-yojana limit due to an obstacle in the path, or approves of such acceptance, incurs a sin. (This incurs the Guruchaumasi atonement.)

**Discussion:**

The Acharanga Sutra (Shru. 2, A. 6, U. 1) prohibits going beyond half a yojana to obtain a vessel. This is the territorial limit for exploration from one's place of residence, allowing travel up to two kos. Going beyond this distance and returning involves excessive time and potential for faults like instability. Therefore, the fifth sutra mentions the atonement for this.

The Acharanga Sutra (Shru. 2, A. 6, U. 1) prohibits accepting a vessel brought from afar, and the atonement for this is mentioned in the Nishith Sutra Uddeśaka 14. The sixth sutra here mentions the atonement for a specific situation.

If the path to the vessel is blocked by a lion, snake, or a mad elephant, or by water, and there is an urgent need for the vessel, and it is being brought from within the half-yojana (two kos) area, then accepting it does not incur the Guruchaumasi atonement according to this sutra. However, accepting a vessel brought from beyond the half-yojana limit does incur this atonement.

The sutra uses the word "sapacchavayansi," which means "a situation with some kind of obstacle." Therefore, a vessel brought from afar due to illness or other reasons can be accepted, but violating the half-yojana limit incurs the atonement mentioned in the sutra.

## [223 Eleventh Uddeshak]  Penance for Criticizing Dharma

7. A monk who criticizes Dharma or approves of those who do so (incurs Guruchaumasi penance).

**Explanation:** Dharma is of two types: 1. Shruta Dharma, 2. Charitra Dharma.

1. **Shruta Dharma:** Criticizing or calling "inappropriate" the eleven Angas, Purvajnaana and Aavashyak Sutra, and their meanings, as well as the five types of Swadhyaya, is considered Avrnavaad of Shruta Dharma. For example:

(1) It is inappropriate to repeatedly mention the six Kayas, the Mahavratas, the principles of conduct, and the concepts of Pramada and Apramada in various places.

(2) What is the purpose of astrological descriptions, "Joonipahuud," and descriptions of auspicious times for monks who have renounced worldly life? Therefore, why is there a need for their inclusion in the scriptures?

(3) All the Agamas are in one language, Ardhamagadhi. This is not right. They should be in different languages.

Making Shruta easy in this way is a criticism of Shruta Dharma.

2. **Charitra Dharma:** Criticizing the fundamental principles or secondary principles of the rules of conduct for Shravakas or Sadhus, and calling them "inappropriate," is considered Avrnavaad of Charitra Dharma. For example:

(1) It is pointless to transcribe scriptures in a place devoid of life.

(2) The entire world is filled with living beings. How can one maintain a pure character while performing actions like walking and moving around?

(3) It is inappropriate to impose severe punishment for minor offenses, such as giving a small monthly penance for the accidental contact of a single sense organ with another body.

(4) The mention of Mokshamachan (urination) as an exception is also inappropriate.

(5) If a householder has prepared food that is contaminated with Pradhaakarma dosha, what fault does a Sadhu have in consuming it?

This is a criticism of Charitra Dharma.

Criticizing Shruta Dharma or Charitra Dharma can cause slow-witted practitioners to deviate from their practice upon hearing it. The one who criticizes binds themselves with Karma like Jnaanavarna, becoming difficult to enlighten.

For detailed information on the penance for criticizing fundamental principles or secondary principles, Desh Dharma or Sarva Dharma, and Grihastha Dharma or Sanayama Dharma, refer to the Bhashya.

**Penance for Praising Adharma:**

8. A monk who praises Adharma or approves of those who do so (incurs Guruchaumasi penance). 

Page #324:
---------------------------
## 224]
[Nishosth Sutra 8. A monk who praises or approves of an act of adharma (unrighteousness). (He incurs Guruchaumasi Pratikraman.)]
**Discussion:** Praising acts of violence, falsehood, or the supporters of sin, such as the Charak-Parivrajaka and others, or praising the five fires penance, the remnants of vows, or the eighteen sins, is considered adharma-prashansa (praising unrighteousness). Praising adharma inspires people to commit those sinful acts. It nourishes the belief in the false nature of beings. Ordinary people are attracted to falsehood.
Therefore, when faced with the occasion to praise sin or adharma, a monk should remain silent, maintain an attitude of indifference, and seize the opportunity to present the true Dharma.
**Householder's Body-Action-Speech Pratikraman**
9 to 62. A monk who performs or approves of the "ammarjan" (washing) of the feet of an Anyatithika (non-Jain) or a householder, once or many times. Similarly, according to the third Uddeshak (Sutras 16 to 69), one should know that a monk who, while traveling from village to village, covers the head of an Anyatithika or a householder, or approves of such an act. (He incurs Guruchaumasi Pratikraman.)
**Discussion:** There are 54 Sutras related to the householder's body-action-speech Pratikraman. A monk incurs Guruchaumasi Pratikraman for serving a householder. These Sutras are discussed in the third Uddeshak, from Sutras 16 to 69. Therefore, refer to them. For the clear meaning of Anyatithika and householder, refer to the discussion in Sutra 15, Uddeshak 1.
**Fear-Inducing Pratikraman**
63. A monk who frightens himself or approves of someone who frightens him.
64. A monk who frightens another or approves of someone who frightens another. (He incurs Guruchaumasi Pratikraman.)
**Discussion:** It is not appropriate for a monk to make himself fearful of ghosts, spirits, demons, snakes, lions, thieves, etc., or to use fear-inducing words to frighten others.
The commentator has stated that if these fear-inducing entities exist, then frightening someone incurs Laghuchaumasi Pratikraman, and if they do not exist, then frightening someone incurs Guruchaumasi Pratikraman. 

Page #325:
---------------------------
## Eleventh Uddeshak

**[225]** A monk should naturally be serious and fearless. Even when fearful circumstances arise, he should remain cautious and discerning. If he needs to inform other saints, he should do so with serious and comforting words, not in a way that causes fear.

Fearful circumstances not arising, yet causing fear in others or oneself, is due to excessive fearfulness or curiosity, which is inappropriate for a monk.

The consequences of causing fear are:

1. Neglect of one's own or others' happiness.
2. Becoming proud due to the pleasure of others being afraid.
3. Becoming agitated or experiencing fear of disease.
4. If a 'ghost' or similar entity enters due to fear or causing fear, it leads to many negative consequences.
5. Useless actions caused by fear can lead to the suffering of the six categories of beings.

Therefore, one should not be afraid oneself, nor should one cause fear in others.

**Vismitikaran Prāyaścitta**

**65.** A monk who makes himself amazed or approves of being amazed.
**66.** A monk who makes others amazed or approves of being amazed. (He incurs Guru-Chaumasi Prāyaścitta.)

**Discussion:**

It is not appropriate for a monk to amaze himself or others through knowledge, mantras, achievements through penance, magic, statements about past, present, and future, disappearance, walking on water, and yoga (combination of substances).

The present sutras state that Guru-Chaumasi Prāyaścitta is incurred for making oneself or others amazed through the imagination of such supernatural practices that one has not personally experienced or witnessed being performed by others. The commentary states that making oneself or others amazed through actual supernatural practices incurs Laghu-Chaumasi Prāyaścitta.

One should understand from this sutra that there are also other forms of Prāyaścitta for causing amazement through various forms of curiosity.

**Consequences of Supernatural Practices** 

Page #326:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**226]**
[Nishīthasūtra 1. 'I have done such a wondrous feat', he may become intoxicated with this joy. 2. By astonishing others, he may become distracted.
3. He may request that knowledge, etc. Giving it leads to a cautious tendency, and not giving it makes him an enemy.
4. Engaging in the use of knowledge, etc., leads to the loss of austerity and restraint. 5. Astonishing others with unreal feats involves the use of illusion and falsehood.
Therefore, both real and unreal wondrous tendencies incur atonement.

**Viparīyasakaraṇa-Prāyaścitta**
67-The monk who makes himself opposite, or approves of the one who makes him opposite.
68-The monk who makes another opposite, or approves of the one who makes another opposite. (He incurs Guru-Caturmāsī Prāyaścitta.)

**Discussion:** Whatever state one is in, such as female, male, child, old, young, diseased, healthy, beautiful, ugly, etc., to act opposite to that state is self-viparīyasakaraṇa. Similarly, to make another act opposite to their state is para-viparīyasakaraṇa. Doing so incurs Guru-Caturmāsī Prāyaścitta.

From sūtra 63 to 68, these six sūtras describe atonement due to the faults of curiosity and illusionary conduct.
In sūtras 67-68, the commentator has discussed the statement of viparīyasakaraṇa more than the act of viparīyasakaraṇa.

**Anyamatapraśaṃsākaraṇa-Prāyaścitta**
69-The monk who praises another religion, or approves of the one who praises it. (He incurs Guru-Caturmāsī Prāyaścitta.)

**Discussion:** To praise the religion, etc., of someone who is devoted to another religion is mukhavarṇa. These are the places of such praise, such as:
1. The Ganga, etc., holy rivers. 

Page #327:
---------------------------
## Eleventh Uddeshak

2. Praise of the Shakyamat (Buddhist) doctrine and other false doctrines.
3. Praise of the Mallagandha dharma (Jain heterodoxy) and other false dharmas.
4. Praise of the Go-vrat (killing of animals) and other false vrats.
5. Praise of the Bhoomidan (land donation) and other false dans.
6. Praise of the 363 forms of Pakhand (heresy) and other wrong paths.

Praising these leads to the strengthening of Mithyatva (false belief) and Mithya-pravritti (false conduct). It diminishes the impact of the Jina's teachings. It also leads to the degradation of the sadhu (monk) as people will perceive him as a flatterer who praises everyone's beliefs.

Therefore, if a monk praises the beliefs of a Kutirthika (non-Jain) in front of them, or praises the main tenets or the main propagator of another religion, he incurs the Guru-chaumasi pratyachit (penance).

The word "Mukhavarna" in the sutra means "to praise what is in front of you". Praising someone in their presence is considered flattery and also attracts the sin of Maya (illusion) and Asatyavachan (false speech) due to the utterance of false qualities. This leads to the Guru-chaumasi pratyachit. Previous sutras have mentioned the pratyachit for Asat-bhayabhitakaran (falsely frightening), Vismitakaran (falsely astonishing), and Viparyasakaran (falsely confusing). Therefore, it is more appropriate to understand that this sutra refers to the pratyachit for excessively praising someone in their presence (false praise).

The Bhashya (commentary) discusses the praise of other religions and their main tenets in the presence of their followers, rather than the praise of "Bhavamukha" (the one who is present). The essence of this discussion is given above.

## Pratichit for travelling to a hostile kingdom

70. A monk who travels to, comes from, or travels to and from a hostile kingdom, or approves of someone doing so, incurs the Guru-chaumasi pratyachit.

**Explanation:**

Travelling from one hostile kingdom to another is "Gaman". Returning from there is "Aagaman". Travelling to and from repeatedly is "Gamanagaman". Alternatively, "Gaman" can be understood as travelling in relation to the Prajnapak (the one who gives instructions), and "Aagaman" as travelling in relation to another place.

If there is hostility between two kings and there is a restriction on entering the territory of one kingdom from the other, then a monk should not go there. If it is absolutely necessary to go there, then going or coming once does not incur the pratyachit mentioned in the sutra. However, repeated travelling to and fro has the potential for many faults, hence the pratyachit is prescribed for it.

The Brihatkalpasutra Uddeshak 1 prohibits this and states that such a person violates both the commands of the Bhagavan (the Jina) and the king. 

Page #328:
---------------------------
[228]
[Nishīthasūtra] This implies that if it is absolutely necessary for a monk to go to or come from an enemy kingdom, then it does not violate the king's order or the order of the Bhagavan.
There can be many types of opposition. Therefore, in those enemy territories where travel is completely prohibited, one should not go there even once. But where there is some allowance for travel for "merchants" etc., or where there is allowance to go and come from other places besides the enemy kingdom, then one can go there if necessary.
If it is not necessary, then one should not travel to such enemy territories.
**Penance for criticizing day-time meals and praising night-time meals**
71. The monk who criticizes the eating of food during the day or approves of the one who does so.
72. The monk who praises the eating of food at night or approves of the one who does so. (He incurs the Guru-Chaumasi penance).
**Discussion** - In the Dashavaikalika Sutra, Chapter 4, it is stated that the monk renounces night-time meals for life through three karana and three yoga. Therefore, praising it breaks the renunciation of approval.
This fault was spoken by the Jñātaputra.
The Nirgranthas do not eat any food at night, knowing it to be faulty. - Dashavaikalika Sutra, Chapter 6, Verse 25.
Meaning - Knowing night-time meals to be faulty, the Jñātaputra, the Shraman Bhagavan Mahavira, said that the Nirgranthas do not eat any kind of food at night.
The implication is that night-time meals are faulty and completely to be abandoned by the monk. By criticizing day-time meals and praising night-time meals, the monk becomes an instigator of night-time meals, which corrupts the vow of renunciation of night-time meals made through three karana and three yoga, and also incurs the fault of presenting a contrary form to the Jina-vani. Therefore, the penance for these is mentioned in the present two sutras.
**Types of criticism of day-time meals**
1. The essence of food is absorbed by the sun, wind, etc. Therefore, the food is not strengthening.
2. The essence of food is taken away by others seeing it. 

Page #329:
---------------------------
## Eleventh Uddeshak

[229 3. One may be affected by the evil eye. 4. Flies and other creatures may fall into food. 5. Bird droppings and other such things may fall from the sky. 6. After eating during the day, one may engage in various types of strenuous activities, leading to excessive sweating and water consumption, which weakens the food's nourishing power.

**Praises of Nighttime Meals:** 1. It increases lifespan. 2. Resting after eating strengthens the senses. 3. The abundance of auspicious karmas leads to a slower aging process.

**Penance for Nighttime Meals:**

A monk who receives food, drink, edibles, or delicacies during the day and eats them during the day or approves of someone else eating them, incurs the Guruchaumasi penance.

73. A monk who receives food, drink, edibles, or delicacies during the day and eats them at night or approves of someone else eating them, incurs the Guruchaumasi penance.

74. A monk who receives food, drink, edibles, or delicacies at night and eats them during the day or approves of someone else eating them, incurs the Guruchaumasi penance.

75. A monk who receives food, drink, edibles, or delicacies at night and eats them at night or approves of someone else eating them, incurs the Guruchaumasi penance.

**Discussion:**

These sutras describe the Guruchaumasi penance for nighttime meals, specifying the time of receiving the food and the time of eating it. This establishes the penance for eating at night, eating at night after receiving it during the day, and eating during the day after receiving it at night. 

Page #330:

## 230]

[The Nishīth Sutra states that consuming food at night violates the fundamental principles like non-violence (ahimsa) and the other five vows. The sixth vow, abstaining from food at night, is also a fundamental principle, and its violation is a transgression. It is impossible to purify minute living beings like insects and the seeds of fruits. Searching for food at night also violates the principle of non-attachment (aeshana samiti).  Churnikaar has said, "Even those who have direct knowledge and see the purity of food and drink, do not eat at night because it violates the fundamental principles."  The Tirthankaras, Ganadharas, and Acharyas have also refrained from eating at night because it violates the sixth fundamental principle. Therefore, one should not eat at night.

**Meaning:** Those who have direct knowledge, even though they know the purity of food and drink, do not eat at night because it violates the fundamental principles. The Tirthankaras, Ganadharas, and Acharyas have not consumed food at night, which violates the sixth fundamental principle. Therefore, one should not eat at night.

**The following passages from the scriptures prohibit eating at night:**

1. The Dashavakalik Sutra, Chapter 3, states that eating at night is considered unrighteous for a Nigrantha.
2. The Dashavakalik Sutra, Chapter 6, states that eating at night leads to corruption of the Nigrantha state and lists its consequences.
3. The Dashavakalik Sutra, Chapter 4, mentions abstaining from food at night as the sixth vow along with the five great vows.
4. The Dashavakalik Sutra, Chapter 8, prohibits even mentally desiring food from sunset to sunrise.
5. The Uttaradhyayanasutra, Chapter 19, Verse 31, describes the difficulty of self-control and mentions that abstaining from all four types of food at night is very difficult.
6. The Brihatkalpa, Chapter 1, prohibits consuming all four types of food at night or during twilight (sandhya).
7. The Brihatkalpa, Chapter 5, states that if one realizes that sunrise has not occurred or sunset has already happened while eating, one should spit out the food in the mouth and perform atonement. It also mentions atonement for swallowing food or water at night and prescribes spitting it out.
8. The Dasha-Dasha, Chapter 2, and the Samavayanga Sutra, Chapter 21, call eating at night a "shabal dosha" (a fault).
9. The Brihatkalpa, Chapter 4, mentions the atonement for eating at night as "anudghatik" (severe).
10. The Thananga Sutra, Chapter 3 and Chapter 5, mention the atonement for eating at night as "anudghatik."
11. The Suyagadaanga Sutra, Chapter 1, Chapter 2, and Chapter 3, mention the five great vows, including abstaining from food at night, as the supreme jewels that a sadhu should possess. This highlights the importance of abstaining from food at night, equating it to the great vows.

**Other scriptures also mention the following regarding eating at night:**

1. Owls, crows, cats, vultures, jackals, and pigs, as well as snakes, scorpions, and lizards, are born from eating at night. [1]
2. One who eats only once a day, receives the fruit of Agnihotra.
One who does not eat at night, receives the fruit of a pilgrimage. [2]
3. There is no offering, no bath, no Shraddha, no worship of deities, no charity prescribed at night, especially not food. [3]
4. It is extremely condemned, for the sake of Dharma and Artha, to eat at night, as it is harmful to insects, worms, frogs, and other living beings. [4]

- Yogashastra A.3: The atonement for keeping and eating food at night.

77. A monk who keeps food, drink, edibles, or delicacies at night, or approves of someone who does so, in a non-critical situation.
78. A monk who consumes even a pinch, a speck, or a drop of food, drink, edibles, or delicacies kept at night in a non-critical situation, or approves of someone who does so. (He incurs the Guruchaumasī atonement.)

77. A monk who keeps food, drink, edibles, or delicacies at night, or approves of someone who does so, in a non-critical situation.
78. A monk who consumes even a pinch, a speck, or a drop of food, drink, edibles, or delicacies kept at night in a non-critical situation, or approves of someone who does so. (He incurs the Guruchaumasī atonement.)

**Discussion:** A monk who keeps even one, two, three, or four types of food at night in a non-critical situation incurs the Guruchaumasī atonement.

There are many places in the Agamas where the collection of food, etc., i.e., keeping food at night, is prohibited. The present two sutras do not mention the atonement for keeping food in a critical situation, but they do mention the atonement for keeping food at night in a non-critical situation. They also state that eating even a small amount of food kept at night in a non-critical situation incurs the Guruchaumasī atonement.

The atonement for eating even a small amount of food kept at night in a critical situation has also been mentioned. Therefore, the meaning of a critical situation should be understood as follows: There is no atonement for keeping food at night if there is no other option, but there is an atonement for eating it. Such a critical situation is possible, for example:

1. After bringing the evening gochari, heavy rain with strong winds (storm, hurricane) may come, and due to darkness, one may not be able to eat. Then the sun sets and the rain does not stop. Due to this, one may have to keep food at night. 

Page #332:
---------------------------
[232]
[Nishīthasūtra
2. If food has been taken in excess, and it is necessary to fast, and at that time heavy rain begins suddenly, which continues from sunset to night, and it is necessary to keep the food, then this is a difficult situation.
It is not proper to eat even a little of the food kept in this way. Eating it will lead to atonement according to the second (78th) sūtra.
The commentator has included illness and other causes in the difficult situation, and has also mentioned the keeping of rare substances etc. as a difficult cause. But it is clear from the Āgama-descriptions that a mendicant should never collect food etc. at night, because in Daśa. A. 6 it is said that 'the mendicant who is even desirous of collecting food is a 'householder', not a mendicant'. Some pre-texts indicating the prohibition of sanniidhi (collection) are as follows:
1. In Daśavai. A. 3 Ga. 3, 'sannihi' is called anācāra. 2. Bidmunbheimam loṇam, tillan sappiṁ ca phaṇiyaṁ. || ṇa te sannihimicchanti, nāyaputtavaora ya ||

9.  Do not eat food that is offered in a place of impurity.
-Suy. Shru. 1, A. 6, Ga. 25

10.  Even if it is offered as a gift, such as:  Odan, Kummas, Ganj, Tappan, Madhu, Bhujjiya, Palal, Soup, Sakkuli, Vedhim, Varasarakachunna, Kosag, Pind, Siharini, Vatt, Moyag, Kheer, Dahi, Sappi, Navaniy, Tell, Gul, Khand, Macchhandiy, Khajjakavanjan, Vihima, etc., it is not permissible to eat it at night, even if it is offered by a friend or a relative.

Question: Shru. 2, A. 5, Su. 4

11.  Even if a monk is offered food, and he is suffering from a disease, such as:  vata, pitta, etc., which affects the whole body, it is not permissible to eat it, even if it is his own medicine or the medicine of another.

Question: Shru. 2, A. 5, Su. 7

This passage clearly states that it is forbidden for a monk to keep any food or medicine overnight. The commentary explains that if a monk keeps food overnight in an exceptional situation, he incurs the prescribed atonement mentioned in the sutra.

A monk who has conquered the disease of greed and the thirst for food and drink will never take advantage of this exception, but will instead follow the path of pure restraint and the commands of the Lord.  For the sake of food, he will not stay overnight elsewhere and incur the atonement for doing so.

79.  If a monk sees another monk taking food from a rich man's house, a woman's house, a house where food is prepared in memory of a deceased person, a cattle shed, or any other such place, and he desires that food or is thirsty for it, and he goes to another place (another upashraya) to spend the night because of that desire, or he approves of someone else doing so, he incurs the atonement of Guruchaumasi.

Meaning:  If a monk sees another monk taking food from a rich man's house, a woman's house, a house where food is prepared in memory of a deceased person, a cattle shed, or any other such place, and he desires that food or is thirsty for it, and he goes to another place (another upashraya) to spend the night because of that desire, or he approves of someone else doing so, he incurs the atonement of Guruchaumasi.

Explanation:  The words "Ahenam" etc. are explained in Acharanga Sutra Shru. 2, A. 1, U. 4.  According to that, the meaning is as given here.  In addition, "Hingolan" there also means food taken on a journey to a Yaksha, etc., and "Sammelan" means food prepared in honor of relatives, etc.

The commentary on this sutra gives alternative explanations for these words, which are as follows:

"Ahenam" - 1. Food, etc., that comes as a gift from another's house. 2. Food, etc., that is taken from the woman's house to the man's house as a gift. 3. Food, etc., that is sent back and forth between the man's house and the woman's house. 

Page #334:
---------------------------
##  [234]
**[Nishiya Sutra]**

**"Paheṇam"** - 1. Food, etc., sent as a gift to another's house. 2. Food, etc., sent as a gift from the groom's house to the bride's house. 3. Food, etc., sent as a gift by someone other than the groom and bride.

**"Hingolan"** - Funeral feast, Shraddha bhojan, etc.

**"Sammelan"** - 1. Food related to a wedding. 2. Goṣṭhībhojan - Food of a group. 3. Food offered at the beginning of any work.

If a monk sees food being carried around during these occasions and knows that a particular householder is hosting a special meal, and due to the desire to partake in that food, leaves the householder's house and goes to stay at someone else's house for the night (on the day before the meal), with the thought that he cannot partake in the householder's food while staying in that house, then he incurs the atonement mentioned in the sutra.

The householder may also insist on the monk staying due to devotion, or the monk may decide to do so on his own. In both situations, if he leaves with the intention of partaking in that food, the atonement mentioned in the sutra applies.

Such actions may lead to attachment to food, public criticism, or other faults related to the body.

The commentator has explained that even if the food is at the house of someone other than the householder, the atonement for changing houses applies according to this sutra. For example, if a devout person is hosting a meal and the location is far away, one can stay overnight closer to that location. In this way, the atonement for changing location should be understood as a Guruchaumasi, in comparison to the householder's food or other food.

**Atonement for partaking in Naivedya food**

**80-J** A monk who partakes in Naivedya pinda, or approves of someone who partakes in it, incurs the atonement of Guruchaumasi.

**Discussion:**

The pinda offered to the Arihantpakshika Devatas like Purnabhadra Mani Bhadra, etc., is called "Naivedya pinda". There are two types of Naivedya pinda:

1. **Nishrakrit:** 1. Offered with the intention of giving it to the monk. This means the Naivedya pinda is made without any mixed-caste impurities. 2. Offered before or after the designated day with the intention of giving it to the monk. 3. The Naivedya pinda is prepared and kept aside for the monk. All these are Nishrakrit Naivedya pinda.

2. **Anishrakrit:** This is not offered with the intention of giving it to the monk.

[235 2. Whether or not the *Anishrakrut* Sadhu is in the village, if a *Naivedya Pind* is naturally prepared for a specific day and the Sadhu unexpectedly arrives, then it is an *Anishrakrut Naivedya Pind*.

The meaning is that for the Sadhu, the *Pahudia Dosha*, *Mishrajat Dosha*, and *Thavanadosha*, etc., are the *Udgam Dosha* (originating faults) in the *Naivedya Pind*. In comparison to this, this is called the *Guruchaumasik* atonement, and that *Pind* is called the *Nishrakrut Naivedya Pind*.

The *Anishrakrut* natural *Naivedya Pind*, i.e., the one kept for donation after being offered to the deity, is an *Anishrakrut Naivedya Pind*, i.e., a *Danapind*. Therefore, it is included in the atonement sutras of the *Danapind* mentioned in the second *Uddeshak* of the *Nishisutra*. There, it is called the *Laghumasik* atonement.

This shows that during the *Agamkal*, a large amount of food was offered to the deities, which was distributed as charity after the worship ceremony.

Similarly, a devotee would also have a tendency to donate to the *Bhikshu* for some reason. Therefore, in this sutra, the atonement for the *Nishrakrut Naivedya Pind* is mentioned in the same context.

The atonement for praising and honoring the *Yathachhand* is:

81. The *Bhikshu* who praises the *Yathachhand* or approves of the one who praises him.
82. The *Bhikshu* who honors the *Yathachhand* or approves of the one who honors him. (He incurs the *Guruchaumasik* atonement).

**Discussion:** The one who creates a form that is contrary to the *Pragam* and is imagined by the *Stramati* is called 'Yathachhand'.

By praising and honoring such a *Yathachhand* *Bhikshu*, he is encouraged, and there is a possibility of the origin of many other faults. Therefore, in this sutra, the *Guruchaaturmasik* atonement is mentioned. By implication, the same atonement should be understood for the exchange of disciples or food, etc.

For honoring and praising the *Pasattha* and other nine types of Sadhus, one incurs the *Laghuchaumasik* atonement. - *Ni. U. 13*.

The mention of other contacts with them, like *Laghuchaumasik* or *Laghumasik* atonement, is in other *Uddeshak*. However, since the *Yathachhand* is the originator of the *Utsutra* form, the contact with him is mentioned here as the *Guru Chaaturmasik* atonement.

Prāyaścitta for ordaining an ineligible person
83. A monk who ordains an ineligible person, whether a layman or a non-layman, an upāsaka or an anupāsaka, or approves of such ordination, incurs prāyaścitta.
84. A monk who installs an ineligible person, whether a layman or a non-layman, an upāsaka or an anupāsaka, or approves of such installation, incurs prāyaścitta.
53. A monk who ordains an ineligible person, whether a layman or a non-layman, an upāsaka or an anupāsaka, or approves of such ordination.
84. A monk who installs an ineligible person, whether a layman or a non-layman, an upāsaka or an anupāsaka, or approves of such installation.
(He incurs the prāyaścitta of Guru-Chaumāsi.)
Discussion- The first sūtra states the prāyaścitta for ordaining an ineligible person. If, after ordaining someone, it becomes known that the person was ineligible for ordination, then according to the second sūtra, prāyaścitta is incurred for installing them.
The first sūtra states the prāyaścitta for knowingly ordaining an ineligible person. The second sūtra states the prāyaścitta for ordaining someone unknowingly and then, upon knowing their ineligibility, continuing to install them.
This implies that after ordination, if ineligibility becomes known, one should not install the person.
There can be two reasons for not knowing about the ineligibility. These are: 1. The candidate concealing their ineligibility. 2. The ordainer not thoroughly investigating and obtaining complete information. In the second case, the ordainer is at fault, and therefore incurs the prāyaścitta mentioned in the sūtra. Whether to leave the person installed or not after installation depends on the decision of the Gītartha.
The following are ineligible for pravrajyā:
1. Child- Under eight years of age. 2. Elderly- Over seventy (70) years of age. 3. Eunuch- Born eunuch, made eunuch, female eunuch, and male eunuch, etc. 4. Inert- Physically weak, mentally deficient, and mute. 5. Klib- Unable to overcome the attachment arising from the words, form, and invitation of a woman. 6. Sick- Suffering from any of the sixteen types of diseases and eight types of ailments. The rapidly fatal ailments are called śīghraghāti, and the chronic diseases are called ciraghāti. -Bhāṣya Gā. 3647. 7. Thief- One who enters another's house at night to steal, a pickpocket, etc. There are many types of thieves, robbers, and plunderers. 8. State criminal- One who has been declared a criminal for committing any act against the state. 9. Madman- Possessed by a yakṣa or insane. 10. Blind- Born blind or one who has lost the sight of one or both eyes later. 11. Slave 

Page #337:

##  [237 Eleventh Uddeshak]

1. **Das** - One who has become a slave due to purchase or other reasons.
2. **Dusht** -  **Kshaya Dusht** (prone to anger), **Vishaya Dusht** (attached to worldly pleasures).
3. **Mookh** -  Foolish, confused in mind, including **Dravya Mookh** (attached to material possessions) and others.
4. **Karj-dar** -  One who borrows another's wealth and does not repay.
5. **Jugit (Heen)** -  Low in caste, karma, skill, or body (having lost limbs like nose, ears, hands, feet, etc.).
6. **Baddh** -  Bound by a vow to someone for learning or teaching karma, skill, knowledge, mantras, etc.
7. **Bhrutk** -  One who receives daily wages or travel allowance.
8. **Apahrut** -  A child brought without the knowledge of parents or guardians.
9. **Garbhavathi** -  A pregnant woman.
10. **Balavatsa** -  A woman with a breastfeeding child.

The commentary elaborates on various sub-categories of these individuals and discusses the faults and atonement for initiating them.

These 20 types of individuals eligible for initiation are described in the Nisheeth Bhashya and other commentaries. The Agam mentions this topic in the Brihatkalpa Sutra, Uddeshak 4. There, it states that initiating three types is considered Akalpany (inappropriate), namely:

1. **Pandak**
2. **Kleb**
3. **Vatik**

The Brihatkalpa Bhashya explains "Vatik" from the reading "Vaiye". However, the Nisheeth Bhashya uses the word "Vahiye" in the description of ineligible individuals, implying a meaning of "afflicted by disease", and uses "Vatik" in the description of types of eunuchs.

**Vatik** - One who suffers from a disorder caused by a wind-related ailment and is only relieved by indulging in immoral acts.

**Kleb** - One who experiences involuntary ejaculation due to sight, sound, touch (embracing), or invitation.

The Brihatkalpa Sutra's original text separates these two from "Pandak" (eunuch) because they are considered men in terms of gender and Vedic qualifications, but they become eunuchs over time. Therefore, despite being men, they are prohibited from initiation.

**Aagamvihari Prati-shayajnani** (one who is well-versed in the Agam and has attained knowledge) can initiate all these individuals as appropriate.

The **Thanang Sutra, Chapter 5, Sutra 108** implies that one can initiate a "Balavaya" (child) with a **Geetarth Diksha** (initiation with a focus on devotional songs) due to certain reasons.

Commentary verse 3738 states that some of these 20 types of eligible individuals can be initiated as appropriate, but the authority to grant Geetarth Diksha to a "Balavaya" rests with the advice of other Geetarth practitioners. Otherwise, the initiator also incurs atonement.

**Individuals eligible for initiation:**

1. **Aryakshetra-utpann** - Born in a noble land.
2. **Jatikul-sampann** -  Born into a noble family.
3. **Lghukarmi** -  One with minimal karma.
4. **Nirmal-buddhi** -  One with a pure mind.
5. **One who understands:**
    * The rarity of human birth in the ocean of existence.
    * The suffering of birth and death.
    * The fickle nature of wealth.
    * The pain of worldly pleasures.
    * The separation from loved ones.
    * The fleeting nature of life.
    * The terrible consequences of actions in the afterlife.
    * The futility of worldly existence.
6. **Virakt** -  Detached from the world.
7. **Alpkashayi** -  One with minimal passions.
8. **Alphasyādi** -  Free from curiosity and frivolous pursuits.

1. One should ask the initiate: "Who are you? Why do you seek initiation? How did you develop dispassion?" If, upon asking, they appear suitable and are not found to be unsuitable in any other way, then it is appropriate to initiate them.
2. Knowing them to be worthy of initiation, one should tell them these good conduct rules: 1. Going for alms every day, 2. Taking only uncontaminated food in alms, 3. Taking it purely, free from faults like greed, etc., 4. After bringing it, giving it to children, the elderly, etc., and eating it with equal distribution, 5. Always being absorbed in self-study, 6.

[239 5. Testing Shraddha and Vivek after teaching, such as:
Telling a person to stand, sit, sleep or lie down on a specific spot, and observing if they are concerned about the spot or not.
Similarly, testing by asking them to walk on wet ground like a pond, move a lamp, fan themselves in the heat, and walk on a path with plants and insects.
Testing by asking them to accept alms with the fault of Eshana.
_ One should only establish those who are qualified in study, knowledge of meaning, Shraddha, Vivek, and testing. If one establishes someone who is not qualified by the above methods, then one incurs Prāyaścitta.
- Nishīth Chūṇī p. 280 Prāyaścitta for causing a person to associate with an unqualified person.
85. A monk who causes or approves of a monk to associate with an unqualified person, whether a relative or a stranger, an Upāsaka or an Anupāsaka, incurs Guruchaumāsi Prāyaścitta.
Discussion: Service can be of many types. However, the commentator has described the unqualified person in terms of service only in relation to Bhikṣācari. They can be of four types:
1. One who has not studied Pidaiṣaṇā, 2. One who does not have Shraddha and interest in service, 3. One who does not know the meaning and ultimate purpose of service, 4. One who cannot avoid faults.
One incurs Prāyaścitta for causing association with such an unqualified person.
This is also appropriate for many other services. One should only ask for service from a monk who is physically capable and also qualified in terms of Kṣayopaśama. Asking for service from someone who is not capable or qualified can lead to many faults and one incurs the Prāyaścitta mentioned in the sutra.
Prāyaścitta for staying in the same place as monks and nuns:
86. A monk who stays in the same place as a monk or nun who is qualified incurs Prāyaścitta. 87. A monk who stays in the same place as a monk or nun who is not qualified incurs Prāyaścitta. 58. A monk who stays in the same place as a monk or nun who is qualified incurs Prāyaścitta. 89. A monk who stays in the same place as a monk or nun who is not qualified incurs Prāyaścitta.

88. An Achel monk who lives with or approves of Sachhel nuns
89. An Achel monk who lives with or approves of Achel nuns. (He receives the Guruchaumasi penance.)
Discussion-1. The Brihatkalpa Sutra states that women should not stay in a place where men are present and nuns should not stay in a place where men are present.
2. The Uttaradhyayanasutra, Chapter 16 and Chapter 32, also prescribe separate beds. 3. The Dashavaikalika Sutra, Chapter 8, Verse 54, states that a monk should always be afraid of women.
4. The Uttaradhyayanasutra 32, Verse 16, states that even if a monk is not tempted by adorned celestial nymphs, it is still better for him to stay in a place without women, knowing that solitude is beneficial.
Although both monks and nuns are keepers of restraint, they should not live in the same place.
Even if a Sachhel monk lives with a Sachhel nun, there is a possibility of many faults, so living with an Achel nun is clearly harmful.
The Nishisha Uddeshak 9 states that living together with a monk and a nun is a Guruchaumasi penance, and here it states that living together with a monk and a nun in the fourfold combination of Sachhel and Achel is a Guruchaumasi penance.
The Thananga Sutra, Chapter 5, Sutra 417, states that if a monk and a nun live together in exceptional circumstances, it is not a violation of the Lord's command.
The Thananga Sutra, Chapter 5, Sutra 418, states that if an Achel nirgranthi lives with a Sachhel nirgranthi, it is not a violation of the Lord's command.
In such a situation, due to circumstances, it is done with discretion under the leadership of the Geetaarth.
Due to the ten reasons mentioned in the above Thananga, the penance does not apply to monks and nuns living together as per the present Sutra.
The Brihatkalpa, Chapter 3, Sutra 1-2, prohibits monks and nuns from standing, sitting, sleeping, etc. in each other's presence.

Thus, the statement of the Brihatkalpa and other Sutras is the method of Utsarga, the statement of the Thananga Sutra is the method of Apavada, and the present Sutra should be understood as being about co-residence without the stated Prāyaścitta situation. Prāyaścitta for eating salt, etc., at night
90. If a monk eats or approves of the eating of preserved pepper or pepper powder, chili or chili powder, ginger or ginger powder, rock salt or refined salt at night, (he incurs Guruchaumasi Prāyaścitta.)
Discussion-The prohibition of collecting salt, etc., is in Dasavai. A. 6, Ga. 18-19, and the prohibition of keeping food, etc., nearby is in many other Agamas. For this, see the discussion of Sutra 77 of this Uddeshak. Eating at night or eating food kept at night during the day also breaks the Ratribhojanaviraman Vrata in its original form.
- Sutra 73 to 76 have stated the Prāyaścitta for all these types of night meals through Chaubhangi.
The present Sutra again states the Prāyaścitta related to night meals, the reason for this is that food, drink, etc., are meant to quench hunger and thirst, but salt, etc., do not have this property. Due to this difference, their Prāyaścitta has been stated separately. Explanation of words
Pippal-A specific medicine-pepper. -Prakrit Hindi Kos p. 58 Miriyam-Chili. It comes in many varieties-red chili, black pepper, white pepper.
In many copies, the words 'Miriyam wa Miri-chunnam wa' are not found, but it seems that these words were in the original text in front of Churnikar, therefore these words have been kept in the original text.
Pepper and chili are both Saccitta substances, but they are also found as Sastraparinat in many places. Singaberam-Ginger. When dried, it is called Sonth, which is Achitta. The Achitta powder of these three can also be naturally available in many places. Bilan wa Lonam-Cooked salt. Ubiyam wa Lonam-Other Sastraparinat salt.
Both these types of salt are Achitta. In the Agama, the names of these two types of salt do not appear with Saccitta salt. Dasavai. A. 3, Ga. 8 states that taking and eating 6 types of Saccitta salt is Anachar, such as

"Sovacchale Sindhave Loṇam, Romāloṇe Ya Āmae.
Samudde Pansu Khāre Ya, Kāla Loṇe Ya Āmae ||" Āchā. Śru. 2, A. 1, U. 10 mentions the prescription for eating these two types of salt. _ Daśavai A. 6, Gā. 18 prohibits the collection of these two, and the present sūtra prescribes atonement for eating salt kept overnight. From the description of these places, it is clear that out of the above six types of conscious salt, if any salt is cooked in fire, it is called 'Bidala-vaṇa' and if it is transformed by other weapons, it is called 'Udbhinna-namak'.
The commentator here describes the food and non-food items, stating that these sūtra-mentioned items, although not quenching hunger and thirst, are added to food and refine food, hence they are also beneficial to food, so they are food.
Medicines are said to be of two types, food and non-food: 1. Those that taste good when eaten are food-like.
2. Those that are undesirable and unpalatable to eat are non-food, such as Triphala etc. medicines, urine, Nimba etc. bark, Nimboli and many other leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds etc. should be understood.
Or whatever can be eaten in hunger is food.
This explanation should be understood only from a particular perspective. Because according to Vyav. U. 9, drinking one's own urine at night is also prohibited, which is called non-food in the commentary. Therefore, these Triphala etc. substances should not be considered as non-food according to the scriptures, even if they are kept overnight, eaten or eaten during fasting etc.
At the end of the discussion, the commentator has also prohibited keeping and eating food and non-food items generally at night. Atonement for keeping food is Guru-chaumāsi and for keeping non-food is Laghu-chaumāsi.

91 - A monk who praises or approves of those who praise any of the following types of self-inflicted premature death, or any other such death, incurs a Guruchaumasi penance: 
1. Falling from a mountain to a visible place and dying, 
2. Falling from a mountain to an invisible place and dying, 
3. Falling into a ditch, well, etc. and dying, 
4. Falling from a tree and dying, 
5. Jumping from a mountain to a visible place and dying, 
6. Jumping from a mountain to an invisible place and dying, 
7. Jumping into a ditch, well, etc. and dying, 
8. Jumping from a tree and dying, 
9. Entering water and dying, 
10. Entering fire and dying, 
11. Jumping into water and dying, 
12. Jumping into fire and dying, 
13. Dying by consuming poison, 
14. Dying by being cut by a sword or other weapon, 
15. Dying by being strangled, 
16. Dying due to the pain of separation, 
17. Dying to regain the present existence, 
18. Dying by being pierced by an arrow, spear, etc., 
19. Dying by hanging oneself, 
20. Dying by being eaten by a vulture. 

**Discussion:** 
In Bhagavati Sutra, Chapter 13, Uddeshak 7, Sutra 81, and in Thananga Sutra, Anga 2, Uddeshak 4, Sutra 113, these 20 types of death are included in 12 types of death. 
Nishith Churni also states that praising any of these twelve types of premature death incurs a Guruchaumasi penance. 
The first four deaths - "falling and dying" - are similar, hence they constitute one type of death. The next four deaths - "jumping and falling" - are also similar, hence they constitute another type of death. Similarly, the ninth and tenth deaths constitute one type, and the eleventh and twelfth deaths constitute another type. Thus, instead of twelve deaths, there are four types of death. Adding the remaining eight types of death, such as poison consumption, etc., we get a total of twelve types. However, looking at the original texts, it is clear that jumping and falling are considered the same, and "Maru" and "Bhigu" are not considered separately but are included in "Giri". Thus, the eight types mentioned in the sutras are included in two types - "Giri-Padan, Taru-Padan", and the four types related to water and fire are included in two types. This makes a total of twelve types. Therefore, both twelve and twenty types are valid, one should understand this. 

The last two deaths are considered permissible due to specific reasons in Thananga, Anga 2, Sutra 113: 1. Vaihanasamaran, 2. Giddhasprushtamaran. Also, in Acharanga Sutra, Anga 1, Uddeshak 4, there is a provision for accepting Vaihanasamaran for the protection of celibacy. 

These twelve or twenty types of premature death are different ways of committing suicide. They are called premature death because they are accepted by knowledgeable people due to their passions. However, if the body is abandoned for the sake of restraint or for the protection of virtue, such as in Vaihanasamaran, or in any other way, it is not considered premature death. 

**Explanation of some words:** 
Giri - Mah - "Giri" refers to a place where, when someone is standing on a mountain, the place below is visible. "Maru" refers to a place where it is not visible.

## Twelfth Uddeshak: Atonement for Binding and Releasing Sentient Beings

**1.** A monk who binds or approves of binding another sentient being with a **tarn-paas** (grass rope), **muj-paas** (hair rope), **katt-paas** (wood rope), **chamm-paas** (leather rope), **bett-paas** (cane rope), **rajju-paas** (hemp rope), or **sutt-paas** (thread rope) incurs a minor atonement.

**2.** A monk who releases or approves of releasing another sentient being bound with a **tarn-paas** (grass rope) to a **sutt-paas** (thread rope) incurs a minor atonement.

**Explanation:**

The word **kolun** signifies compassion or empathy. Compassion is of two types:

1. Compassion towards a **shayyatar** (householder) or similar individuals.
2. Compassion towards a sentient being.

1. If a monk is staying near a stable or enclosure and the householder leaves for some work, and an animal tries to escape, then binding it or following the householder's instructions to bind or release animals at specific times is considered compassion towards the **shayyatar**.

2. If a bound animal is struggling to break free, releasing it or binding it for its safety in a designated place is considered compassion towards the animal.

A monk is a **mudhajiv** (one who lives by begging) and practices **nihspprih** (non-attachment) through **samyam** (self-control). Therefore, performing personal tasks for a householder out of compassion goes against his **shraman samaachari** (conduct of a monk).

Binding an animal can cause it suffering and distress, leading to the **tajjan** (intentional) **himsa** (violence) offense. Releasing an animal can also lead to harm if it gets injured, lost, or preyed upon by other animals in the wild. 

Page #348:
---------------------------
[248]
A monk should not stay in a place that breaks his samadhi. If he has to stay there due to some reason, he should remain detached.
In the eleventh Uddeshak, performing household duties with a sense of service or attachment is called Guru Chaturmasik Pratikraman. Opening and closing of animals etc. are also household duties. However, if a monk performs any household duty out of compassion in a special situation, then he incurs Laghu Chaturmasik Pratikraman according to this sutra. And if he performs any worldly act like tying, opening etc. out of attachment or affection for the householder, then he incurs Guru Chaturmasik Pratikraman.
- Although the acts of opening and closing of animals etc. are not prescribed for the one who practices restraint, here, performing it out of compassion is called Laghu Chaturmasik Pratikraman instead of Guru Chaturmasik Pratikraman.
Having compassion is the main characteristic of Samyaktva, yet there are many restrictions on the restrained life of a monk so that he does not get entangled in many household activities. If a monk has more food or water than necessary, even if he is in a position to eat, he is not allowed to give it to a hungry or thirsty person, either on request or without request. Because this type of giving tendency or performing the tendency mentioned in this sutra can gradually lead the monk to get entangled in many activities and deviate from the main goal of restrained practice. In Uttara. A. 9 Ga. 40, Namiraj Rishi says to Shakrendra in response to the inspiration of charity:
"Tassavi Sanjamo Seo, Aditass Vi Kinchanam."
Meaning - Restraint is superior even to the great charity of a householder, even without giving anything.
There is a difference in the Pratikraman for the general situation of compassion and the Pratikraman for the special situation, which depends on the decision of the Pratikraman giver according to the meaning of the song.
If an animal or human being is in danger of death and there is no one to save them, if a monk saves them in such a situation, he does not incur Chhed or Tap Pratikraman. He only needs to be criticized by the Guru.
_ If there is any act of breaking the rules like tying, opening etc. household work, giving food and water etc. or any act of violence against living beings in that tendency of compassion, then Laghu Chaturmasik Pratikraman is incurred.
_ Tirthankara Bhagwan Mahavir Swami saved Goshalak, who was about to be burnt to ashes by Tejo Leshya during the time of restrained practice, with his Shital Leshya and said after attaining Kevalgyan: "I gave up Shital Leshya for the sake of compassion for Goshalak, due to which the Tejo Leshya of the Vesh Yayana Bal Tapasvi was obstructed." - Bhag. Sh. 15
Therefore, in this sutra, it should be understood that there is no Pratikraman for compassion or compassion, but for the household tendency or the tendency to break the rules of restraint that is done along with it.

Penance for Breaking Pratyakhyana
3-J Bhikkhu AbhikKhanam-AbhikKhanam Pacchakkhanam Bhanjai Bhanjantam Va Saizjai.
3-A monk who repeatedly breaks Pratyakhyana or approves of the one who breaks it. [He receives the Laghu Chaturmasik penance.]
Discussion-Repeatedly breaking Pratyakhyana is called a strong fault in Dasha. D. 2. Repeatedly means many times, here the commentator has said that this Sutra-mentioned penance comes after breaking Pratyakhyana for the third time.
Here, Pratyakhyana should be understood as the right to Pratyakhyana like "Namukkar Sahiyam" etc. in the form of Uttar Guna. That is, this penance comes after breaking "Namukkar Sahiyam" etc. intentionally for the third time.
Faults arising from breaking Pratyakhyana
"Apacchao Ya Avanno, Pasang Dosho Ya Adadhruta Dhamme. Maya Ya Musavaao, Hoi Painnai Lovo Ya ||
Nishi. Bhashya, Ga. 3988 1. "Whoever repeatedly breaks Uttar Guna Pratyakhyana, he will also break the Mula Guna Pratyakhyanas", thus he becomes a subject of disbelief = distrust.
2. There is Avarnavada of himself or the Sangha.
3. Breaking one Pratyakhyana leads to the possibility of breaking other Mula Guna Pratyakhyanas and the tradition of many faults increases.
4. There is no firmness in other Pratyakhyanas and in following the Shraman Dharma.
5. He does one thing in Pratyakhyana and another in conduct, which leads to the use of Maya. For example, he takes Ekashana after rejecting Ayambil.
6. He says one thing and does another, hence the fault of Mrishavaad is attached. For example, he says "I am having Ekashana today" and eats twice.
7. He may speak falsely with Maya to hide his own fault. 8. Breaking Pratyakhyana is a violation of restraint.
9. Repeatedly breaking Pratyakhyana may cause a deity to become angry and make him agitated.
This is the penance for neglecting Pratyakhyana and intentionally breaking it many times. But if the Aagaras mentioned in the Pratyakhyana Sutra are used, then Pratyakhyana is not broken, but its criticism should definitely be done with the Geetarth Bhikkhu.

**The Nishītha Sūtra is required. It is also necessary to seek the guidance of the Gītartha before consuming any specific food. A Gītartha who is not [Abahuśruta] or is not a Pariṇāmī or Atipariṇāmī monk is unfit to decide on the consumption of food or exceptions to the rules.**

**It is also essential to be mindful of the location, time, and person when deciding to consume food or make exceptions. In difficult situations, one should firmly adhere to the guidance of the Gītartha and refrain from consuming food. This not only brings great benefit to oneself but also contributes to the influence of the Jinaśāsana.**

**Therefore, a monk should firmly adhere to the principle of non-violation of the vow of non-consumption, even once.**

**Prāyaścitta for consuming food mixed with all bodies (Pratyekakāya-saṃyukta āhārakaraṇa-prāyaścitta)**

**4. A monk who consumes food mixed with all bodies or approves of such consumption.** [This incurs a Laghu-Cāumāsī Prāyaścitta.]

**Discussion:** The fourth Uddesaka mentions the Laghu-Māsīka Prāyaścitta for consuming grains and seeds with awareness. The tenth Uddesaka mentions the Guru-Cāumāsī Prāyaścitta for consuming food mixed with countless bodies, such as fermented food. This Sūtra mentions the Laghu-Cāumāsī Prāyaścitta for consuming food mixed with all bodies.

**The discussion of the aforementioned Sūtras is found in their respective Uddesakas. Food mixed with all bodies includes:**

1. **Food containing salt with awareness, where the salt has not been purified by fire.**
2. **Buttermilk or juice of fruits, etc., containing water with awareness, as long as they have not been purified by fire.**
3. **Dishes that have coriander leaves, etc., added after being removed from the fire.**

**Here, the mention is of substances containing countless living beings, as the mention of substances containing all bodies in the form of grains and seeds has already been made in the fourth Uddesaka. Therefore, food containing salt, water, and certain plants with awareness, and where the substance or time for purification by fire has not passed, is called food mixed with all bodies. If one becomes aware of this after consuming such food, one should not consume it. If one becomes aware after consuming some of it, one should spit out the remaining food and perform the Prāyaścitta.**

**Cārṇikāra has mentioned the existence of food, such as grains, containing various types of leaves, flowers, fruits, etc., with awareness. He has also mentioned the custom of householders adding salt immediately to food. If a monk consumes such food, it violates the principle of non-violence towards living beings, thus polluting the first Mahāvrat.**

**The Prāyaścitta for knowingly consuming such food, unknowingly consuming it, or consuming it due to a compelling reason, differs. The decision rests with the Gītartha. A table of Prāyaścitta is given at the beginning of the first Uddesaka.**

## Twelfth Uddeshak

[251 Sarom-Charma-Paribhog-Prayaschitta]

5- The monk who uses or approves of the use of skin with hair. [He incurs a Laghu-Chaumasik Prayaschitta.]

**Discussion:**

Generally, it is not appropriate for a monk to keep skin [in the Utsargamarga]. It is permissible to keep and use it only when necessary due to some reason. In old age, when the marrow of the body becomes weak, the skin rubs against the bones of the waist and other parts, or if there are diseases like leprosy, piles, etc., then skin can be used.

Skin is not a medicinal accessory for a monk, therefore, all the sutras related to this topic mentioned in the Brihatkalpasutra, Uddeshak 3, should be understood from the perspective of exceptional situations.

The meaning of those sutras is that in special circumstances, a monk or nun can take and keep a piece of skin without hair, which is suitable for use. In a special situation, a monk can use skin with hair according to the method mentioned in the sutras, but he cannot keep it for a long time. For a nun, skin with hair is completely prohibited.

There are the following disadvantages of using skin with hair:

1. Many microscopic creatures are born in the hair.
2. Transcription cannot be done properly.
3. It becomes moldy or gets infested with insects in the rain.
4. Keeping it in the sun causes harm to those creatures.

If it is necessary to bring skin with hair in any situation, then it should be brought from a blacksmith, goldsmith, etc., who use it for sitting all day and it is unnecessary for them at night. It should be kept overnight and returned, because blacksmiths, goldsmiths, etc., work near fire all day, so the possibility of life arising in it is not possible for one night. Therefore, keeping it for more than one night is prohibited.

Churnikar has said that this Prayaschitta mentioned in the sutras should be understood for a monk, but if a nun uses skin with hair, then Guru-Chaumasik Prayaschitta arises.

Explaining the reason for the complete prohibition for a nun, the commentator says that skin with hair gives the feeling of touch like a man, therefore, it is completely forbidden for a nun.

However, skin without hair can be taken by a monk or nun in special circumstances and kept for a fixed time. There is no mention of Prayaschitta in the sutras for keeping it.

The commentator has said in the discussion of this sutra that if a monk keeps skin without hair, he incurs Guru-Chaumasik Prayaschitta, and if a nun keeps it, she incurs Laghu-Chaumasik Prayaschitta. This has been said from the perspective of keeping it without any reason. Because keeping any accessory without any reason is worthy of Prayaschitta. 

Page #352:
---------------------------
## 252

The commentator has described in detail here other books, grass, etc., which are also prone to dust mites, due to the presence of dust mites in the Nishith Sutra wrapped in leather. The summary is as follows:

1. **Book Quintet:**
    1. **Gandi Book:** A book that is square and long, with equal width and thickness.
    2. **Kachchhpi Book:** A book that is wider in the middle and narrower at the edges, with less thickness.
    3. **Musti Book:** A book that is round, with a diameter of four fingers, or square with four fingers in length and width.
    4. **Samputa-Phalaka Book:** A book made from the planks of trees, etc.
    5. **Chhedapati Book:** A book made from the leaves of palm trees, etc., with less width and more length and thickness, and with one, two, or three holes in the middle.

All these books are prone to dust mites and therefore difficult to read, hence they are considered unsuitable.

2. **Grass Quintet:**
    1. **Shali**, 2. **Vrihi**, 3. **Kodrava**, 4. **Ralak (Kangu)** - these four are types of straw-like grass, and 5. **Praranyaka** - wild grass like Shyamaka, etc.

These are also prone to dust mites. The description of these grasses is found in the Uttaradhyayanasutra, Adhyaya 23, Gatha 17:

"Palalam phasuyam tattha, panchamam kusa tanani ya.
Go yamas sa nisijjaae, khippam sampaname."

**Toka:** This Gatha states that there are four types of straw, seedless and suitable for bedding, and five types of Kusa grass. The "chakara" indicates that other suitable grasses are also included.

The commentator has called these five grasses unsuitable for reading due to the presence of dust mites, and has also prescribed a short-term atonement for them.

The presence of dust mites in these straws is evident, yet they are called "prasauk" in the above Gatha. The reason for this is that they become "prasauk" when used by householders.

In the Agam era, both Sadhus and Shravaks used straw, Darbha, etc. This is described in many Agams. Their use has become very limited in the present time.

3. **Unsuitable Cloth Quintet:**
    1. **Koyavirui:** Cloth with Koyavirui attached.
    2. **Pravaraka:** Large blankets from Nepal, etc., with wool attached.
    3. **Dadhigalli:** Cloth with ten, i.e., pods attached.

11. The bodies of many Sanghātim beings stick to the letters or their blood gets on the letters.
Four examples of killing living beings - 1. Deer from the midst of the four-armed army, Sanpātim beings, 3. Sesame seeds or Trasa beings from the oil mill etc. and many beings like fish etc. may possibly escape, may also be saved, but the person who goes cannot be saved. Therefore, it is said in the commentary
2. Tṛṇa-Pañcaka
Jattiya mettā vārā, muñcati, bandhati ya jattiyā vārā. Jatti akkharāṇi lihati va, tatti lahuga ca āvajje.
As many times as these books are opened, closed or as many letters are written, so many times there is a small Chaturmasik atonement and the atonement for the creature that dies also comes separately.
2. From ghee, milk etc. 4. Caught in a net in the middle of the book
Bha. Ga. 4008
1. There is killing of small beings like Kuṭhue etc.
2. There is self-killing from poisonous creatures.
3. Therefore, as many times as one turns over or contracts and expands, so many small Chaturmasik atonements come.
In the remaining three Pañcakas, due to the transcription not being pure or due to the killing of living beings, there is a violation of restraint. Therefore, due to the Bhūṣira fault, these instruments are not fit to be taken. But in a situation of exception, if these instruments are taken, then atonement should be taken for them and they should be considered as inconceivable instruments or cursed instruments.
Brihatkalpasutra Uddesaka - 3 has a provision of limited use of wool and leather for the Sadhu and there is also a description of taking Tṛṇa-Pañcaka in Uttaradhyayanasutra Pra. 23 etc. many Agamas. From these descriptions, it is concluded that sometimes, due to circumstances, these Bhūṣira instruments can also be kept in a way that does not kill living beings, according to that method and limit. But when the killing of living beings is possible or not necessary, then they should be abandoned.

Due to physical circumstances, if necessary, the Charma Pañcaka and Tṛṇa-Pañcaka or Vastra-Pañcaka can be taken and used, in the same way, due to reasons like forgetting the scriptures etc., books etc. means can also be kept with the said discretion, as they are helpful in studies.
It is the necessary conduct of a Bhikshu to transcribe and clean both times the technical and cursed titles kept with him. Accordingly, if books are to be kept as his title, then they should also be transcribed and cleaned both times as per the rules. By doing so, there is no possibility of the faults mentioned in the commentary and there is also convenience in the worship of knowledge.

[255 Compared to the books of the past, the books of the present age have very little Jhushira. Therefore, the possibility of defects in them is also less.
Many types of living beings are born in uncopied books kept in knowledge repositories without proper discernment. There is a high possibility of killing living beings while using such books, therefore, proper discernment should be exercised.
Penance for sitting on a covered platform
6-J If a monk sits or approves of sitting on 1. a grass platform [stool etc.], 2. a straw platform, 3. a dung platform, 4. a cane platform, 5. a wooden platform covered with a householder's cloth, he incurs [a minor four-month penance].
Discussion: The word "ahi-chhe" refers to all actions like sitting, sleeping, standing etc. The platforms mentioned in the sutra [bajot etc.] are generally used for sitting.
The sutra mentions platforms made of grass etc. These platforms can be used by the monk. But if they are covered with a householder's cloth, then sitting on them incurs a minor four-month penance.
If they are defective due to Jhushira, then they are not acceptable and the defects mentioned in the fifth sutra should be understood.
If there is no defect related to Jhushira, then other auxiliary equipment made of grass, cane etc. can also be acceptable.
It is permissible for a monk to accept a platform, stool, bed, and bedding, but it is not permissible for a monk to use a householder's cloth. Therefore, a platform etc. covered with cloth is not permissible. Because a platform covered with cloth has defects due to uncopying or improper copying, and killing living beings is also possible. Therefore, the penance for using a platform covered with cloth is mentioned in the present sutra.
Penance for getting a Nigranthi's shawl stitched
7-J If a monk gets a Nigranthi's [shawl] stitched by a non-Jain or a householder, or approves of getting it stitched, he incurs [a minor four-month penance].

## Nishīthসূত্র

**For a sādhvī, it is prescribed to have four sheets.** This is based on the number of sheets. **In terms of measurement, it is prescribed to have sheets of three measurements:** [4 cubits, 3 cubits, 2 cubits].

**These sheets can be made of one piece or multiple pieces.** A sheet made of one piece does not require stitching, but a sheet made of multiple pieces requires stitching or getting it stitched. Therefore, the present sūtra refers to the right of a sheet made by joining multiple pieces of cloth.

**A bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī can do the necessary stitching themselves.** If there is no one to do it, then they can get it done from each other with the knowledge of the gītartha, due to circumstances.

**If at any time, no bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī nearby can do the stitching, then if they get it stitched from a householder, then according to Uddesaka 5 sū. 12, they incur a laghumāsika prāyaścitta.** However, if a sādhvī gets her sheet stitched by a householder, then according to the present sūtra, they incur a laghucoumāsika prāyaścitta.

**Getting clothes stitched from a householder is not within the bounds of a sādhvī's conduct.** However, there is a possibility of other faults in getting a sādhvī's sheet stitched. For example, the householder who stitches it may ask whose sheet it is. If the correct answer is given, then they may use it for vashikaran (hypnotic control), or they may spread false rumors about the sādhvī's brahmacharya (celibacy). Therefore, it is best not to do this.

**If it is necessary to get it stitched from a householder, then it should be done with discretion in the following order:**

**Bhāṣya Gāthā:** "Pachchakaḍ, sābhiggah, ṇirabhiggah, bhaddae ya asannī. Gihi aṇṇatitthiēṇ vā, gihi puvvaṁ ētare pachcha."

**The meaning of this gāthā has been explained in the discussion of Uddesaka 1 sūtra 15.**

**Thānāṅg Pra. 4 sū. 59 and Prāchā. Śru. 2. 5 u. 1 state that a sādhvī should have 4 sheets and their measurements.** Āchārāṅgasūtra also states that if cloth of the prescribed measurement is not available, then pieces of cloth of lesser measurement should be joined together to make a sheet of the prescribed measurement. Therefore, in such a situation, it becomes necessary to stitch or get it stitched. In such a case, if one acts with awareness of the sūtra's instructions, then there is no prāyaścitta.

**Sthāvara Kāya - Himsā Prāyaścitta**

**2. Āukāyass vā,**

**8. Je bhikṣu 1. Puḍhavikāsa vā, 3. Agaṇikāyass vā 4. Vāukāyass vā, 5. Vaṇassai kāyass vā, kalmāyam avi samāraṃbhaī, samāraṃbhatam vā sāijjai.** 8. Any bhikṣu who commits violence, even in a small amount, against 1. Earth, 2. Water, 3. Fire, 4. Air, or 5. Plants, or approves of such violence, incurs a laghucoumāsika prāyaścitta.

## Twelfth Uddeshak

**Discussion**

The number of beings in the earth element is very small.

**Explanation**

The five single-sense beings, starting with the earth element, are described in Acharanga Sutra, Chapter 1, Section 1. Their existence, the types of their violence, and the causes of their violence are described there.

The vow of not harming them is mentioned in Dashavaikalika Sutra, Chapter 4. The nature of the Muni's vow in this regard is also mentioned in Dashavaikalika Sutra, Chapter 6.

The Bhagavati Sutra, Pannavanasutra, Uttaradhyayanasutra, and other Agamas describe the various types of beings in the earth element.

**[257]**

The Nisitha Bhashya Pithika Gatha 145 to 257 discusses in detail how a monk can commit violence against the five stationary beings, starting with the earth element, and the various options for their atonement. Therefore, one should study the above-mentioned texts for detailed information.

Here are some places where violence can occur:

**Places where violence against the earth element can occur:**

1. **In the vicinity of a dwelling:**  If one receives alms with a hand or a utensil that is smeared with the powder of any of the following eleven substances, it constitutes violence against the earth element: 1. Black soil, 2. Red soil, 3. Alkali, 4. Orpiment, 5. Realgar, 6. Manjistha, 7. Collyrium, 8. Salt, 9. Ochre, 10. Yellow soil (Met), 11. Alum.

Or, if the giver gives alms while grinding or mixing these substances, it constitutes violence against them.

2. **On the path:** If the path is made of or contains any of the following, walking on it constitutes violence against the earth element: 1. Black, red, or yellow soil with life, 2. Mud, 3. Sand, 4. Gravel, 5. Pieces of stone, 6. Salt, 7. Alkali, 8. Coal.

Land that has been recently plowed, the ground beneath fruit-bearing trees, and land that has become wet due to rain and is not used for walking are also considered mixed. The soil that forms a crust on the banks of rivers, ponds, or ditches when the water dries up becomes inhabited. Walking or sitting on these places constitutes violence against the earth element.

Generally, the top four fingers of soil become lifeless due to walking, cold, heat, etc., and the soil below that is either mixed or inhabited.

On a path where the earth is inhabited or mixed, it becomes lifeless within one to three praharas due to the movement of humans and other beings.

Soft earth becomes completely lifeless after being thoroughly ground, while hard earth becomes lifeless only on the surface after a change in color. This is because the hardness prevents the inner beings from being harmed by the touch of feet, etc.

* When the moisture of water that has fallen on the path disappears, i.e., when the water is completely absorbed into the earth, it becomes insentient.
* When the water of a river, pond, etc., dries up completely, there are no Apkāya beings in it, but the sentience of Pṛthvīkāya remains there for some time.

**Places of Violation of Agnīkāya**

**1. In Gocharī:**
* Taking an object that has been in contact with fire, or taking an object placed on fire, or starting a fire in any way by the giver for the purpose of giving alms.

**2. In Upāśraya:**

## Twelfth Uddeshak

[259] From a subtle perspective, every movement of the body involves the violation of the Vayu-kaya. This violation continues until the time of Yoga-nirodha at the end of the thirteenth Gunasthan. It has no relation to the rules of restraint or this atonement chapter.

It is not permissible for a monk to fan himself to cool down a substance or to calm down bodily heat. Performing essential activities with 'effort' leads to the binding of sinful karma, i.e., it is considered a Savadya activity.

- Dasha. Pra. 4

The meaning of 'effort' - In performing any action, moving the hands, feet, body, or tools with rapid speed, throwing something upwards when placing it down, and not using the hands, etc., in essential bodily processes like sneezing, coughing, etc., should be understood as 'effort'.

**Places of violation of Vanaspati-kaya:**

1. **On the Path:** While walking on the path, in villages or outside villages, walking on green grass, new sprouts, flowers, leaves, seeds, etc., or on land covered with moss, or touching them, violates the Vanaspati-kaya.

Sitting in the shade of a tree, if one carelessly touches its branches, etc., or touches flowers, leaves, seeds, etc., lying there, it violates the Vanaspati-kaya.

2. **In Gochari:** After consuming green vegetables, fruits, flowers, seeds, moss, etc., or touching them, consuming food, fire, etc., consuming unripe mixed or conscious green vegetables, etc., half-ripe sattu, hole, etc., or touching these plants by the giver for the purpose of giving alms, violates the Vanaspati-kaya.

1. Seeds, grains, 2. Green plants, and 3. Food containing moss, if consumed, violates the Vanaspati-kaya. The atonement for which is mentioned in the fourth, twelfth, and tenth Uddeshak respectively.

If any substance, such as pieces of plants, peels, leaves, and freshly ground chutney, etc., is attached to the giver's hand or a shovel, etc., then receiving a blow from them violates the Vanaspati-kaya.

3. **In Parishthapan:** Excreting feces, urine, phlegm, mucus, food, water, and other bodily waste on green grass, on land covered with sprouts and moss, and on seeds, flowers, and leaves, violates the Vanaspati-kaya. At dusk, one should carefully examine the land for the night's rest and choose a place free of plants, etc., for Parishthapan. Failure to do so violates the Vanaspati-kaya.

**Atonement:** If a householder violates the Prithvi-kaya, Ap-kaya, Agni-kaya, Vayu-kaya, and every Vanaspati-kaya in Gochari, then the atonement is Laghu-masik. If one violates the Ananta-kaya, then...

##  [260]

This Sutra describes the **Lahu-Chaumasi** atonement for the violation of the five stationary beings (earth, water, fire, air, and space) by a Sadhu. If a Sadhu violates an **Anant-Kay** (ordinary plant body), the atonement is **Guru-Chaumasi**, as described in the commentary (Gatha 117). For further details on atonement options, refer to the commentary (Gatha 117) and the Churni from Gatha 145 to 257.

The commentary (Gatha 258 to 289) similarly discusses the violation of **Tras-Kay** (minute living beings). While this Sutra focuses on the atonement for violating the five stationary beings, the discussion on Tras-Kay is included here for its relevance.

**Violation of Tras-Kay can occur in various situations:**

1. **On the Path:** Red and black insects, worms, termites, snails, shells, mussels, leeches, mosquitoes, small frogs, and other creatures may be found on paths, in villages, or other areas. A monk, due to carelessness, may inadvertently violate these creatures while walking. To avoid this, the monk should carefully observe the path or cleanse it before walking, especially if there is no alternative route.

2. **During Alms-Seeking:** 
    * **Food:**  Butter, curd, ghee, and other products made from sugarcane may contain minute living beings. Similarly, cold water may also harbor Tras-Kay. Consuming these without careful observation can lead to their violation.
    * **Food:** Insects may be present in various food items, and their violation can occur if not noticed.
    * **Food:** Insects may be present at the place where alms are received, leading to their violation by the giver.
    * **Food and Water:**  "Rasaj" (minute living beings) may develop in food and water due to fermentation, altering their taste and smell. These creatures are visible as saliva-like substances when such food is divided or when water is touched by hand.  Violation occurs if these Rasaj are not noticed.

Therefore, a monk must be skilled in examining food and water, in addition to being proficient in the methods of seeking alms.

If food or water containing Tras-Kay is accidentally received, it should be purified if possible. If purification is not possible, it should be discarded. The methods for purification are described in the previous sections.

## Twelfth Uddeshak

[261]

The specified gathas and the "Parishthapanika Niyukti" are mentioned in the necessary sutra, section 4. Nishita Churnikar has also directed the same place.

3. In the bed - insects, moths, termites, various types of ants, spiders, etc. can be in the shelter. Therefore, by looking at each movement or by cleaning, there is no violation of these beings.

In the place of the house which is not cleaned, in such a high place or on the edge of the place, and under the cupboards etc. or in the grass, spiders and creatures like Kuthuva of the same color as that place are born. If grains etc. are kept near the shelter, then creatures like caterpillars and Dhaneria also move around. Due to carelessness, these beings can be violated.

If there are flies, mosquitoes, etc. in the house, then while scratching or turning over, if there is no awareness of worship, and if there is no care in keeping or eating liquid substances, then these beings are also violated.

4. In the clothes, there may be lice, etc., in the bed, there may be termites, bedbugs, etc., in books and cupboards, etc., there may be moths, etc., and in grass, etc., there may be various types of parasitic beings. By writing or cleaning without awareness, or by using them, these beings can be violated.

If the monk does not take a house, bed, etc. containing living beings, and if he follows the Shramana Dharma of writing them both times with proper method, then there is no possibility of the birth of many types of beings. Due to which there is no violation of those beings.

If care is taken to expose the clothes to the sun at the right time, then there is no possibility of the birth of beings in them either.

On the roads and other places, there is a possibility of the above-mentioned Tristhavar beings, but if care is taken to see the beings in every movement or to clean them, then they are not violated.

There are many alternatives to atonement for many alternatives of violation, information about them can be obtained from the commentary. Briefly, the atonement for the violation of stationary beings is mentioned above. - The general atonement for the violation of Tris beings is as follows:

Violation of two-sense beings - Laghu Chaumasi, violation of three-sense beings - Guru Chaumasi, violation of four-sense beings - Laghu Chahmasi, violation of five-sense beings - Guru Chahmasi.

Atonement for climbing a tree with consciousness -

9. Je Bhikkhu Sachitt-Rukkha Duruhhai, Duruhantm Wa Saizjai.

9. The monk who climbs a tree with consciousness or approves of the one who climbs it. (He gets Laghu Chaumasi atonement.)

##  [262]

**Discussion**

There are three types of sentient trees:

1. **Trees with a countable number of living beings**, such as the palm tree.
2. **Trees with an uncountable number of living beings**, such as the mango tree.
3. **Trees with infinite living beings**, such as the **Thura** tree.

Climbing a tree with a countable or uncountable number of living beings incurs a **Lahu-Chaumasi** penance, while climbing a tree with infinite living beings incurs a **Guru-Chaumasi** penance.

The fifth **Uddeshak** also mentions penance for standing near a sentient tree.

If one has to climb a tree due to a flood, a wild animal, or a thief, then the penance mentioned in the **Sutras** is incurred. If the situation demands, the penance can be increased.

**Consequences of Climbing a Tree:**

1. **Violation of the plant body.**
2. **Scratches on hands, feet, etc., while climbing.**
3. **Violation of other living beings if one falls.**
4. **Self-violation due to injuries on hands, feet, etc.**

**[Nishita Sutra]**

5. **Seeing a monk climbing a tree can raise many doubts in someone's mind.**
6. **It can also lead to disregard for Dharma.**

**Penance for Eating from a Householder's Vessel:**

It is not possible to climb trees like **Thura** and **Graak** which have infinite living beings, so one should understand the penance for taking support from them.

10. **A monk who eats from a householder's vessel or approves of someone doing so, incurs a Lahu-Chaumasi penance.**

**Discussion:**

A monk can accept food from a householder and eat it, but they cannot eat from the householder's plate, bowl, etc., and they cannot drink water from their glass, jug, etc. This is the practice of a monk's life.

The tenth **Prashna**, **Gatha 51-52-53**, prohibits this, stating: "A monk who takes food or drink from a householder's vessel made of bronze, clay, or any other material, becomes corrupt in their practice."

The householder's vessels are violated when the monk eats or drinks from them, and when the water is thrown away, many living beings are also violated. **Jineshwara Deva** has called this **Asanyam** (uncontrolled behavior).

**Washing the vessels leads to violence against the body, therefore...** 

Page #363:
---------------------------
## Twelfth Uddeshak

**[263]**  Because of the attachment of **pūrvakarma**, **paścātkarma**, and other faults, it is not appropriate for a monk to eat or drink from the utensils of a householder. For the same reasons, **nirgrantha** monks do not consume food or drink from the utensils of householders.

**Daśavai. A. 3 Ga. 3** refers to the tendency to eat from a householder's utensils as **anācāra** (unrighteous conduct).

**Sūy. Śru. 1 A. 2 U. 2 Ga. 20** states that a monk who does not eat from the utensils of a householder is considered **samāyik** (observant of the vows) and **cāritravān** (virtuous).

**Sūy. Śru. 1 A. 9 Ga. 20** states that a monk should never consume food or water from the utensils of a householder. The faults that arise from eating from a householder's utensils are:

1. Eating in the householder's home.
2. Eating food brought by the householder.
3. Having the utensils washed by the householder, either before or after use.
4. Purchasing new utensils.
5. Having separate arrangements for food and water.

And so on, leading to a multitude of faults.

Therefore, according to the **āgama**, a monk should consume food only from utensils made of wood, clay, or **tumba** (a type of gourd) that have been received. They should not use plates, bowls, glasses, or pitchers belonging to a householder.

The above **āgama** texts prohibit the use of a householder's utensils for food and water. The commentaries on these texts also discuss the faults associated with food and water. Therefore, if a householder's utensil is used as an auxiliary tool for washing clothes, the **sūtra**-prescribed **prāyaścitta** (atonement) does not apply. This is because using them does not incur **paścātkarma** or other faults.

**[11]** **Je bhikku gihivattham parihei, parihentan vā sāijjai.**

**[11]** A monk who wears the clothes of a householder or approves of someone wearing them (incurs a **laghucoumasi** atonement).

**Discussion:** When a monk needs clothes, they should request them from a householder. However, it is not appropriate for a **paḍihārī** (attendant) to accept clothes from a householder and use them before returning them. This is what the present **sūtra** refers to as atonement.

Furthermore, only clothes that are meant to be returned are considered the clothes of a householder. Using them incurs **pūrvakarma**, **paścātkarma**, and other numerous faults. These should be understood as similar to the faults mentioned in the discussion of householder utensils.

**Sūy. Śru. 1 A. 9 Ga. 20** prohibits the use of clothes belonging to a householder.

Therefore, a monk should only use clothes that have been given to them completely by a householder, in accordance with **muni** (sage) tradition. However, they should not use clothes that are meant to be returned.

## 264]
[Nishith Sutra: Penance for using a householder's seat]
12. A monk who sits on a householder's seat or approves of someone sitting on it. (He incurs a Laghu-Chaumasika penance.)
**Discussion:** There are many types of seats, such as beds and couches, that are not permissible or difficult to justify for a householder. A monk who goes to a householder's house for alms or other purposes is prohibited from sitting there and sleeping on a couch, etc., as stated in Dasavai. A. 6. This is also considered misconduct in Dasavai. A. 3.
Dasavai. A. 6 also mentions the faults of sitting in a householder's house, and it is considered permissible for the elderly, the sick, and the ascetic to sit there. However, sitting on a bed or couch is prohibited for everyone. This is the penance mentioned in the present Sutra.
Sutra 6 describes various types of backrests and cushions. If a householder's cloth is not on them, then according to that Sutra, there is no penance for sitting on them.
Thus, if a householder's seat, couch, etc., is made of wood, etc., and is easily justifiable, then a monk can accept it as "Padihari" and use it. If the chair, etc., is a seat with a support, then a monk can accept and use it. However, the Brihatkalpa U. 5 prohibits a nun from accepting a supported bed or seat. Uttara. A. 17 Ga. 19 calls someone who sits on a householder's seat a "Papi Shraman" (sinful monk).
Suy. Su. 1 A. 9 Ga. 21 prohibits sitting on a stool, couch, etc.
Therefore, a monk should not sit on these seats of a householder.
**Penance for treating a householder**
13. A monk who treats a householder or approves of someone treating a householder. (He incurs a Laghu-Chaumasika penance.)
**Discussion:** It is not permissible for a monk to prescribe medicine or other treatments for a householder's illness, or to perform any kind of surgery.
Uttara. A. 15 Ga. 8 prohibits various types of medical treatment. Dasavai. Chulikā 2 states that "a monk should not treat a householder." Dasavai. A. 8 Ga. 51 prohibits prescribing medicine to a householder. Dasavai. A. 3 Ga. 6 calls treating a householder (medical practice) misconduct. Dasavai. A. 3 Ga. 4 calls treating a householder (medical practice) misconduct. 

Page #365:
---------------------------
## Twelfth Uddeshak:

**Faults in Medical Practice**

1. Many medical practices involve harmful tendencies.
2. The use of harmful substances is encouraged.
3. Even if a disease is cured by restrictive medical practices, it can lead to an increase in the movement of many people.
4. If a medical practice worsens someone's disease, it brings disrepute. Due to these faults, the Sutra prescribes atonement for a monk engaging in household medical practice.

**Acharanga Sutra 1.2.5** states that medical practice involves many harmful tendencies like killing, etc. Therefore, a monk should not engage in the practice of treating diseases.

Knowing these scriptural injunctions, a monk should not engage in household medical practice. If, due to circumstances, medical practice is used, the atonement prescribed in the Sutra should be undertaken.

**Atonement for Taking Food Prepared with Previous Actions**

14. A monk who takes food, drink, edibles, or delicacies with a hand, earthen pot, ladle, or metal vessel that has been touched by previous actions, or approves of someone who takes such things, incurs a minor four-month atonement.

**Explanation:** If a householder washes their hands or a ladle, bowl, etc., before offering food to a monk, then those hands or utensils are considered to be touched by previous actions. It is not proper to accept alms from them. This is because washing them involves violating the principles of non-violence and non-harming.

In many families, it is customary to touch food items after washing hands. Some people want to offer alms with a washed vessel out of a sense of purity, or they want to wash the food that has touched their hands or vessels before offering it. Therefore, a discerning monk who is aware of the situation should prohibit the donor from washing their hands, etc., beforehand. Even if the donor washes their hands, etc., before or after the prohibition, the monk should not accept the offering.

**Acharanga Sutra 2.1.6** provides a detailed explanation of this topic.

This fault is included in the "giving" faults of the category of "desire."

**Dashavaikalika Sutra 5.1.32** also prohibits accepting alms from hands, etc., that have been touched by previous actions.

If the donor washes their hands, ladle, etc., with water that has been purified by chanting, then the fault of previous actions does not apply. However, if they wash with water that has not been purified by chanting, or if they wash without discernment, then the fault of previous actions applies. 

Page #366:
---------------------------
##  [266]
[Nishipa Sutra]

If a monk does not accept food even after the donor is accused in this way, he does not incur the atonement mentioned in the sutra. If he accepts food with washed hands, etc., he incurs the Laghu-Chaumasik atonement.

In the Bhadrabahu-krit Niyukti Gatha 4066, it is said that if another man gives another food or the same food, it can be accepted. But according to the commentary in Gatha 4072, it is not permissible to accept food from a person whose hands have been involved in previous karma, even after his hands have dried.

The Bhikṣācārī-Aticāra-Pratikramāṇa text in Āva. A. 4 also mentions the fault of previous karma.

**Atonement for accepting food from a water vessel**

15. If a monk accepts food, drink, edibles, or delicacies from a householder or another non-Jain, with wet hands, a clay pot, a ladle, or a metal vessel, or approves of someone who does so, (he incurs the Laghu-Chaumasik atonement).

**Discussion:**

The previous sutra states that if a donor washes his hands, vessels, etc., before giving alms, then accepting food from him does not incur atonement. This sutra states that if a householder is performing any action with conscious water, which makes his hands wet with conscious water, or if a vessel is being used to fill or carry conscious water, then accepting alms from such hands or vessels constitutes a violation of the living beings in the water. Furthermore, if that hand or vessel is then placed in other conscious water, it also violates the Apkāyik beings.

Thus, this sutra states the atonement for the violation of the water remaining in the hands, etc., and the subsequent violation that occurs later.

The commentary explains that when accepting alms from a vessel used to carry or drink water, a portion of the food remains in the vessel, which, when placed in water, violates the Apkāyik beings. Therefore, one should not accept food from vessels that have been used for conscious water.

If one accepts un-conscious hot or cold water from such hands, vessels, etc., it violates the water present in the hands, vessels, etc., and the remaining un-conscious water in the vessels violates other conscious water.

The fourth Uddesaka states the Laghu-Māsik atonement for accepting food from wet or oily hands, vessels, etc., with conscious water. Here, the Laghu-Chaumasik atonement is stated in relation to the fault of subsequent karma. 

Page #367:
---------------------------
## Twelfth Uddeshak

[267 The fourth Uddeshak mentions general utensils and other things, but here it mentions the hand used while working with conscious water and the utensil used to take and drink conscious water. This is the difference in the subject matter of the sutras in these two Uddeshak.
The word 'Seoudag Paribhogena' used in the present sutra is explained as follows - "Jena Mattena Sachittodagam Paribhujjati, Tena Bhikkhaggahanam Padisiddham" - This means that it is forbidden to accept alms from utensils used for conscious water or from utensils used to take, give, or remove conscious water. 
**Penance for attachment to form**
16. A monk who contemplates, or contemplates with attachment, the following for the sake of visual enjoyment:
1. Fields, 2. Fruit trees, 3. Granaries, 4. Toranas (gateways), 5. Fire altars, 6. Fire altar enclosures, 7. Forts, 8. Passes, 9. Storehouses, 10. Houses with a roof, 11. Houses with trees, 12. Houses on hills, 13. A tree or a piece of wood, 14. A mound of earth or a piece of wood, 15. Seats, 16. Platforms, 17. Temples, 18. Roads, 19. Paths, 20. Merchant houses, 21. Merchant halls, 22. Learned houses, 23. Learned halls, 24. Beautiful objects, 25. Proud objects, 26. Strong objects, 27. Crooked objects, 28. Colored objects, 29. Iron objects, 30. Wooden objects, 31. Cemetery objects, 32. Peaceful objects, 33. Mountain objects, 34. Cave objects, 35. Rock objects, 36. Residential houses.
17. A monk who contemplates, or contemplates with attachment, the following for the sake of visual enjoyment:
1. Wells, 2. Rivers, 3. Ponds, 4. Rings, 5. Caves, 6. Cave entrances, 7. Forests, 8. Forest entrances, 9. Mountains, 10. Mountain entrances, 11. Fields, 12. Tanks, 13. Wells, 14. Creeks, 15. Wells, 16. Ponds, 17. Streams, 18. Canals, 19. Lakes, 20. Lake banks, 21. Lake and river banks.
18. A monk who contemplates, or contemplates with attachment, villages to royal palaces for the sake of visual enjoyment.
19. A monk who contemplates, or contemplates with attachment, large villages to large royal palaces for the sake of visual enjoyment.
20. A monk who contemplates, or contemplates with attachment, village roads to royal palace roads for the sake of visual enjoyment.
21. A monk who contemplates, or contemplates with attachment, village boundaries to royal palace boundaries for the sake of visual enjoyment.

**Rukkh-Wa Cheiya Kadan** (a place under a tree, a tree inhabited by a deity).
**Thubhan-Wa Cheiya Kadan** (a place under a **Stupa** (a dome-shaped Buddhist monument), a **Stupa** inhabited by a deity).

**Giri-Guha-Kandara-Gufa** (a cave).
**Bhavan-Giha-Van-Raiya-Mandiyan-Bhavan, Van-Vivajjiyan-Giha** (a building with a forest, a house without a forest).

The words **"Uppalani, Pallalani, Ujjharani, Nijjarani"** appear frequently in Sutra 16, but there is no indication of their meaning in the **Acharaang Tika, Pracharangani, or Nisihchuni**. These four names are not appropriate in the context where they appear.

These four words appear after **"Vappani Wa Falhihani Wa"**. However, in the **Acharaang Sutra**, the phrase **"Pagarani Wa"** appears after **"Vappani, Falhihani"** in many places. The **Nisihchuni** also explains **"Pagarani"** after **"Vappani, Falhihani"** in its commentary on this Sutra.

Here, the original text has been retained according to **Acharaang Shru. 2 A. 3 U. 3 and A. 4 U. 2** and **Nisihchuni**. It is clear that the text of this sixteenth Sutra and the following seventeenth Sutra in the **Nisihchuni** has become corrupted due to a scribal error after the commentary (explanation).

Kalha, Dib, Damar are all types of troubles. "Mahayuddha" and "Mahasangram" are types of battles. In the discussion of this Sutra in Acharang and Nishith, only the word "Kalha" is mentioned. But different texts are found in the manuscripts. Other words available in Nishith Sutra and Acharang Sutra are:
1. Kharani Va, 2. Verani Va, 3. Bolani Va, 4. Do Rajjani Va, 5. Vairrajani Va, 6. Viruddha-Rajjani Va.
The first three words are found more in Nishith and the last three words are found more in Acharang. Out of these, Bolani is included in Kalhani. The remaining five are emotional. Since they do not match the subject matter of the Sutra related to the place and are not found in the Bhashya, Chuni, these words have not been included in the original.

## Twelfth Uddeshak

[273]

These two words are similar. The Churnikar of Acharanga has explained only one word, and the Nishita Churni indicates that there are two words. Both citations are given above.

In Nishita, the meaning of Thim, Vedhi, etc. is related to flowers, while in Acharanga, it means to wrap with cloth, etc.

The word "Pattachhejjakamanni" is found more often in many manuscripts, but it is not present in the Churnis of both Sutras. This word is present in the Acharanga Tika. The word "Vihimani" is also present at the end of this Sutra in the manuscripts, but it is not mentioned in the Churni or Tika.

In the Acharanga Tika, the four words Ganthimadi are first, and the words Katthakamanni, etc. are later. But both Churnikars have first explained Katthakamanni, etc. and then explained Ganthimadi, etc.

This Sutra is found in many manuscripts at the beginning of these Sutras or at different places, but the Nishita Churnikar has placed this Sutra where he has explained it.

In the Acharanga Sutra, the explanation of this Sutra is in the Tika of the 12th Adhyayan, and the explanation of all the remaining Sutras is in the 11th Adhyayan. But in the Pracharanga Churni and Nishita Churni, there is complete similarity in the Sutra location and word location. In both Churnis, the mention of Mahamahotsavas is done after this.

The explanation of the three Sutras of Mahotsava, Mahamahotsava, and Mahashravasthanas is available in the Bhashya Gathas. But in the manuscripts of Nishita, only the original text of one Sutra is found. The Churni indicates the existence of all three Sutras.

In Acharanga, the original text and Tika of two Sutras are available, and in the Acharanga Churni, like the Nishita Churni, there is an indication of the existence of all three Sutras. Therefore, two Sutras are placed according to Acharanga, and one Mahamahotsava Sutra is placed according to Nishita Uddeshak 8. For clarity of the meanings of these three Sutras, see the eighth Uddeshak.

The Bhashyakar has used the words "Itthimadi Thana" for festivals, "Samavayadi Thana" for Mahamahotsavas, and "Viruvaruvadi Thana" for Mahashravasthanas in Gathas 4137, 4138, and 4139 respectively.

The last Sutra mentions the atonement for the attachment of all known, unknown, seen, and unseen forms. This Sutra uses four words for attachment, while in Acharanga, five words are also found. There, the word "No Mujhbhejjja" is more, which means not to faint, and after that, "No Prajjhovavjejjja", which means not to faint excessively.

In the Acharanga Sutra, the description of the attachment of form is in the 12th Adhyayan in the second Shruta Skandha, and before that, the description of the attachment of words is in the 11th Adhyayan. But in the Nishita Sutra, the atonement for the attachment of form is mentioned first in the 12th Uddeshak, and then the atonement for the attachment of words is mentioned in the 17th Uddeshak. This is an inversion in the description of both Sutras.

## Nishīthasūtra (Chapter 274)

**Verses on the prohibition of attachment to sense objects like sound, form, etc., and various Prāgama sayings on remaining indifferent to them:**

1. One who is *prāmāda* (desiring sense objects) is said to be the doer of his own soul.
- Prācā. Śru. 1, Adhyāya 1, Uddesa 4

2. The objects of the senses are the root cause of the world. The objects of the senses are the root cause of the world. One who desires these objects of the senses becomes overwhelmed by great suffering, falls under their control, and engages in *prāmāda* conduct.
- Prācā. Śru. 1, Adhyāya 2, Uddesa 1

3. Sound, etc., are the cycles of the world. Sound, etc., are the cause of the cycles of the world. People in the world, seeing living beings in various directions, up, down, sideways, and east, etc., and hearing sounds, become unconscious. This is said to be the cause of the world. One who is not free from these objects is outside the command of the Lord and again consumes sound, etc.
- Ācā. Śru. 1, Adhyāya 1, Uddesa 5

4. It is extremely difficult to conquer these sense objects... Those beings who desire these sense objects grieve, become cruel, shed tears, suffer, and become greatly distressed when they do not obtain them or when they are lost.
- Prācā. Śru. 1, Adhyāya 2, Uddesa 5

5. One who has truly understood the consequences of attachment to sound, form, smell, taste, and touch and has renounced them is a seeker, a soul-aspirant, a knower, a scholar of scriptures, righteous, and self-controlled.
- Ācā. Śru. 1, Adhyāya 2, Uddesa 1

6. The muni, remaining indifferent to sounds and forms, renounces birth and death and, through self-control, becomes free from birth and death.
- Prā. Śru. 1, Prakaraṇa 3, Uddesa 1
- Ācā. Śru. 1, Prakaraṇa 3, Uddesa 2

7. Living beings, becoming attached to sense objects, accumulate karma.

8. Some munis, who restrain their senses like eyes, etc., again become attached to these sense objects, which are the cause of karma bondage, due to the arising of delusion. Those young beings are not free from karma bondage, cannot violate the *saṃyoga* (connections), remain in the darkness of delusion, do not understand the path of liberation, and cannot obtain the benefit of worshipping the Lord's command.
- Ācā. Śru. 1, Adhyāya 4, Uddesa 4

9. For one of little strength, it is extremely difficult to renounce sense objects.
- Prācā. Śru. 1, Adhyāya 5, Uddesa 1

10. Many worldly beings, attached to form, etc., are wandering in many births. Those beings experience many sufferings there.
- Prācā. Śru. 1, Adhyāya 5, Uddesa 1

11. Young beings, attached to form, etc., or attached to violence, etc., fall away from dharma and wander in the world.
- Prācā. Śru. 1, Prakaraṇa 5, Uddesa 3
Beings attached to form, etc., suffer and lament pitifully. Yet, they cannot be freed from the fruits of those karmas.

## Translation:

**276]**

A monk who goes to see many places, develops attachment and aversion towards them, binds karma, praises the initial work with words, and approves of the careful actions thinking that it is good. Or sometimes he may criticize or praise the creator.

While staying at the places mentioned in the sutras, aquatic, terrestrial, aerial, etc. beings may be distressed upon seeing the monk, run here and there, eat and drink, etc. Due to such reasons, there is a lack of restraint and karma binding. Therefore, the monk should renounce desire for objects and practice pure restraint.

In the ninth Uddesaka, it is said that even going one step to see the king or queen is a Guru-Chaumasika atonement. And in this twelfth Uddesaka, it is said that going to see various places is a Laghu-Chaumasika atonement. The monk should not even think of going to see these places. If by chance he does think of it, he should restrain himself and immerse himself in self-study, meditation, and restraint.

**Atonement for violating the time limit for food:**

**32.** A monk who takes food, drink, edibles, or delicacies in the first watch and keeps them until the last fourth watch, or approves of the one who keeps them, (incurs Laghu-Chaumasika atonement).

**Discussion:**

In the twenty-sixth study of the Uttaradhyayanasutra, while describing the daily routine of a monk, verses 12 and 32 prescribe going for Gochari in the third watch.

* The Bhagavati Sutra, Antakrid Dasha Sutra, Upasaka Dasha Sutra, etc. mention going for Gochari in the third watch in many places.
* In the Dasha Shruta Skandha, Dasha. 7, it is prescribed that a monk who carries an image can go for Gochari in any one of the three divisions of the day. There is no prescription or prohibition of the first, second, third, or fourth watch.
* The Brihatkalpa Sutra, Uddesaka 5, states that if a monk, while eating near sunset or sunrise, realizes that the sun has not risen or has not set or has set, and if he spits out the food from his mouth, hand, or vessel, he does not violate the command of the Bhagavan. But if he eats after knowing, he incurs atonement.
* The Brihatkalpa, Uddesaka 4, states that it is not appropriate for a monk or nun to keep food and water taken in the first watch until the fourth watch. If it is forgotten by mistake, it should be spit out.

**Conclusion:**

Monks and nuns should generally go for Gochari in the third watch. In special circumstances, they can go for Gochari at any time of the day, depending on the suitability of the area. But it is not appropriate to keep the food taken for more than three watches. If it is forgotten by mistake, it should not be eaten. It is said in the Chuni...

## Twelfth Uddeshak

[277 "To take food in the first porisi of the day, and to finish it in the fourth porisi, that is the rule."
"There are three paharas before noon, and three paharas after noon. If one is tempted by vices during those paharas, it is called apachchitti. After noon, even with vices, it is called sapchchitti."

The Bhashya and Churni state that collecting food leads to many vices:
1. If ants, etc., enter the food, it is difficult to remove them, and it is a violation.
2. One has to be careful of dogs, etc., and many other activities have to be performed.
And there is also the possibility of many other vices. Therefore, the monk should eat the food in the same pahara in which it is received. It should not be kept for the next pahara. Because keeping it leads to the possibility of the above-mentioned vices.

The Bhashya-kar has also said that if a Jinakalpika monk keeps the food for the next pahara, he incurs a prayaschitta. But a sthavirakalpika monk is allowed to keep it for three paharas. Even if ants enter the food despite careful efforts, there is no prayaschitta. But if it is kept for the fourth pahara, even if the above-mentioned vices do not occur, prayaschitta is prescribed.
If there are vices while keeping the food for Jayana, it is still acceptable, according to the authority of the Agam.
- Bha. Ga. 4148 Churni. This sutra states that keeping food received in the first pahara for the fourth pahara is a laghuchoumasi prayaschitta. The fourth Uddeshak of the Brihatkalpasutra also states that eating it is a laghuchoumasi prayaschitta.

According to the Churni, this sutra should be similar to the sutra in Brihatkalp U. 4, because while explaining the phrase "Ahachch Uvainaavie Sia", the Churnikar has stated that eating it is also a laghuchoumasi prayaschitta. But if a Jinakalpika keeps or eats the food in the fourth pahara, he incurs a guruchoumasi prayaschitta.

_ When the day is divided into hours and minutes, dividing it by 4, the number of hours and minutes obtained is added to the time of sunrise to get the time of the first porisi, and subtracting it from the time of sunset gives the time of the fourth porisi.

## Prayaschitta for violating the territorial limits of food
33. If a monk receives food, drink, or anything to be eaten or drunk, beyond half a yojana, he incurs a prayaschitta. 

Page #378:
---------------------------
## Nishīthasūtra 33:

**33. A monk who takes or approves of taking alms, food, or drink beyond the limit of two kosas, incurs the minor four-month penance.**

**[278]**

**Discussion:**

The regulation of the excellent area limit for taking or bringing food is stated in Uttarādhāyaṇa Praśna 26, and in the Brihatkalpa Uddesaka 4, it is forbidden to take food beyond half a yojana. If one goes beyond this limit by mistake, it is forbidden to eat that food, and penance is also prescribed for eating it. The present sūtra only prescribes penance for taking food beyond the limit.

**Consequences of taking food beyond two kosas:**

1. More water will be taken.
2. More weight will lead to more labor.
3. The absence of a limit will increase the collection of wealth.
4. Attachment to food will increase.
5. A tradition of many other faults will grow.

The area limit of half a yojana is stated in the Āgamas. This limit is mentioned to avoid the collection of wealth. This limit is from the place of residence in all four directions, meaning that a monk can go for alms up to half a yojana in all four directions from his residence, and while traveling, he can take food and water with him up to half a yojana from his residence.

This area limit is based on the human body, which is measured in angulas.

**4 kosas**
**2 kosas**
**1 yojana**
**1/2 yojana**
**1 kosa**
**2 kosas**
**2000 dhanush**
**43 miles = 7 kilometers**

In Brihatkalpa Uddesaka 3, half a kosa is mentioned as an additional limit in each direction. This is mentioned in relation to going to a place called Sthandila.

Two and a half kosas in one direction and including two directions is called an avagraha of five kosas. Therefore, the main center of the area limit is considered to be the monk's place of residence - the upāśraya.

"Sese sakosa mandala, mula nibandha anumuyantaṇam." - Bri. Bha. Ga. 4845

**Meaning:** If there is no obstacle in any direction, such as a mountain, river, or sea, then one should understand the avagraha as a mandala shape with a length of one kosa and one yojana, without leaving one's original place. That is, the diameter (length) of the circular area formed in all four directions should be one kosa and one yojana. 

Page #379:
---------------------------
## Twelfth Uddeshak

[259]
Thus, the essence of the sutra of the Brihatkalpa Uddeshak 3 and 4 is that it is permissible to take or bring food from one's residence in all directions up to two kos, and if it is necessary to go beyond that for the purpose of excreting, it is permissible to go up to half a kos further.

## Night-time Application Prāyaścitta

34. A monk who takes cow dung during the day and applies it to a wound on his body the next day, or approves of someone doing so, incurs a prāyaścitta.
35. A monk who takes cow dung during the day and applies it to a wound on his body at night, or approves of someone doing so, incurs a prāyaścitta.
36. A monk who takes cow dung at night and applies it to a wound on his body during the day, or approves of someone doing so, incurs a prāyaścitta.
37. A monk who takes cow dung at night and applies it to a wound on his body at night, or approves of someone doing so, incurs a prāyaścitta.
38. A monk who takes cow dung during the day and applies it to a wound on his body during the day, or approves of someone doing so, incurs a prāyaścitta.
39. A monk who takes cow dung during the day and applies it to a wound on his body at night, or approves of someone doing so, incurs a prāyaścitta.
40. A monk who takes cow dung at night and applies it to a wound on his body during the day, or approves of someone doing so, incurs a prāyaścitta.

[Nishīthasūtra
37. A monk who takes cow dung at night and applies it to a wound on his body at night, or approves of someone doing so.
38. A monk who takes a substance for application during the day and applies it to a wound on his body the next day, or approves of someone doing so.
39. A monk who takes a substance for application during the day and applies it to a wound on his body at night, or approves of someone doing so.
40. A monk who takes a substance for application at night and applies it to a wound on his body during the day, or approves of someone doing so.
41. A monk who takes a substance for application at night and applies it to a wound on his body at night, or approves of someone doing so. (He incurs the Laghu-Chaumāsi Prāyaścitta.)

**Discussion:** If it is necessary to apply cow dung or other substances suitable for application as medicine to a wound, etc., a monk who is a Sthavirakalpi can take it during the day and use it during the day. As stated in the two four-fold statements of the sūtra, if it is used at night or the next day, the Laghu-Chaumāsi Prāyaścitta is incurred for keeping it overnight and using it.

In the eleventh Uddesaka, a Guru-Chaumāsi Prāyaścitta is mentioned for similar four-fold statements regarding the consumption of food. Since the fault of application is less than that of consuming food at night, the Laghu-Chaumāsi Prāyaścitta is mentioned here.

The discussion regarding the four-fold statements and the relationship between Sanniidhi and Sangraha should be understood according to the eleventh Uddesaka.

The Bhāṣya states that fresh buffalo dung is excellent for detoxification, and if it is not available, cow dung is also beneficial. Dung that has been exposed to sunlight, is old, or is partially dry is not as beneficial.

Therefore, if it is necessary to use it at night, the Laghu-Chaumāsi Prāyaścitta mentioned in the sūtra is incurred.

Other substances for application are prepared for specific uses. These can be used for a long time. However, due to intense pain, the Laghu-Chaumāsi Prāyaścitta is incurred if they are used within the time mentioned in the present sūtras.

These substances for application can remain on the body at night after being applied during the day. This does not incur any Prāyaścitta.

There are four types of substances in terms of their properties: 1. Those that soothe pain, 2. Those that ripen boils, etc., 3. Those that draw out pus and blood, 4. Those that heal wounds. The atonement for causing a householder to carry one's belongings
42. If a monk causes a householder or another non-Jain to carry his belongings or approves of it, he incurs a minor atonement. 43. If a monk gives food, drink, edibles, or delicacies to a householder for the purpose of carrying his belongings or approves of it, he incurs a minor atonement.
42. If a monk causes a householder or another non-Jain to carry his belongings or approves of it, he incurs a minor atonement. 43. If a monk gives food, drink, edibles, or delicacies to a householder for the purpose of carrying his belongings or approves of it, he incurs a minor atonement. (He incurs a minor atonement for four months.)
Discussion-The scriptures prescribe that a monk should carry only a very small amount of belongings, which he can easily carry himself. For a detailed discussion on belongings, see Sutra 39 in the sixteenth Uddeshak.
If a monk has to carry more belongings due to physical illness or the weight of scriptures, etc., he incurs the atonement mentioned in the sutra.
According to the scriptures, a healthy monk can carry the belongings of a sick monk. It is not in accordance with the principles of restraint to have a householder accompany you and carry your belongings. Any sinful act that occurs during the householder's walking, etc., is also considered to be approved of by the monk in the form of approval. If the householder drops the belongings, breaks them, places them in an inappropriate place, or runs away with them, it leads to a loss of mindfulness.
The householder may experience discomfort due to the weight of the belongings or the journey. If he becomes ill due to the exertion, there is a possibility of a chain of faults arising, such as the need for medication, treatment, etc.
If the householder does not find food on the way, the monk's resolve may be strengthened, or if he gives the householder food from his own collection, he incurs atonement according to the other sutra.
If the householder demands wages for carrying the belongings, it leads to a fault in relation to the great vow of non-possession.
If the householder is given food, it may become known to other donors, which could lead to a decrease in their affection for the monk and their desire to donate.
Therefore, a monk should carry only as many belongings as he can carry himself. If, due to circumstances, he has to carry more belongings and have a householder carry them, he should take other necessary precautions and also accept the atonement mentioned in the sutra.

##  Atonement for Crossing the Great Rivers

44. A monk who crosses these five great rivers, which are called, counted, and famous: 1. Ganga, 2. Yamuna, 3. Sarayu, 4. Eravati, 5. Mahi, by foot twice or thrice in a month, or by boat, or approves of someone crossing them, incurs a minor four-month atonement.

**Explanation:**

According to the Churni, crossing a river once in a month is permissible according to the *masakalp vihar* (monthly residence). However, crossing it twice or thrice in the same month is prohibited.

**Note:**

* Crossing these rivers nine times in eight months does not incur atonement. This includes crossing twice in the first month and once in each of the remaining seven months.
* The *Dasha-shruta-skandha* (Dasha 2) states that crossing these large rivers three times in a month and ten times in a year is a serious offense.
* The *Brihat-kalpa-sutra* (Uddeshak 4) prohibits crossing these large rivers twice or thrice in a month. It also states that crossing smaller rivers with water reaching halfway up the calf is permissible.
* The words *dukkhut* and *tikkhut* imply that atonement is incurred if one crosses a great river three times in the first month and twice in each of the remaining months. The Churni attributes the lack of serious offense and atonement for crossing twice in the first month and once in each of the remaining months to the *masakalp vihar*. Refer to *Dasha. Da. 2* for further clarification.

**Uttaranam Santaranam:**

Crossing by arms or feet is called *uttaran*. Crossing by means of a *kumbha*, *divari*, *nava*, *chhoti nava*, *tumba*, etc. is called *santaran*.

**Ima:**

The word *ima* refers to these five great rivers, while the rest are mentioned as *mahasalila* (great waters).

## Twelfth Uddeshak

[283 Meaning - The remaining large rivers are also indicated by the statement of the five rivers. These five major rivers never dried up and were famous in the ancient wandering area. Therefore, the Sutra refers to their name and number. One should understand the other large rivers of that time by their characteristics.
Mahannv-Mahaslila 'Bahudako' - having abundant water. Mahanaipro - main rivers.
The Brihatkalpasutra Uddeshak 4 and Pracha. Shru. 2 A. 3 U. 2 describe the method of crossing a river on foot, and Aacha. Shru. 2 A. 3 U. 1 & 2 describe the method of crossing a river by boat and the method to be followed in case of an attack.
The five rivers mentioned in this Sutra may also have less water at times. The Brihatkalpasutra Uddeshak 4 mentions that the Airavati river near Kunala city had less water.
According to the Utsarga Vidhan, a monk is not even allowed to touch water. But this is an exception if he has to cross a river while traveling. The Bahutkalpashabhya and Nishithabhashya discuss this exception and its reasoning in detail. There are many options for how much to travel by land and how much by water, based on the earth, green grass, flowers, etc.
There are also many options in the Prāyaścitta. The method of swimming using a boat, a raft, etc. is also described. For this, one should study the Bhashya. The summary of the twelfth Uddeshak is: 1-2 Binding or releasing sentient beings.
Repeatedly breaking the vow of non-acceptance. 4 Consuming mixed food of each body.
Using wool and leather. Sitting on a straw mat covered with clothes belonging to a householder. Getting a householder to sew a Sadhvi's sheet. Even slightly harming the five stationary beings like earth, etc.
Climbing a tree with awareness. 10-13 Eating from a householder's utensils, wearing a householder's clothes, sitting on a householder's bed, treating a householder. 14 Consuming food with previous karma defects. 15 Consuming food from a water vessel (a householder's vessel for taking and removing raw water). 16-30 Visiting places of interest.

(He incurs the minor four-month penance.)

##  [288]
[Nishith Sutra]

**Explanation of words:**

* **Thuna-Veli-Chhota Thamba:**  Small pillar.
* **Giheluko-Umbaro-Dehli:**  Doorway.
* **Asukalam-Ukkhalam-Ukhala:**  Mortar.
* **Kamajalan-Hanapidham-Snan ki Chauki:**  Bath platform.

**Silansi-Lelusi:** These words appear twice in these sutras. First, they are used in a conscious way and later in a celestial way.

* **Kuliyansi:**  Mud wall or thin wall.
* **Bhittisi:**  Brick, stone, etc. wall or river bank.
* **Khandhansi:**  "Khandam Pagaro Pedham Wa" - Fort, platform or pillar house.
* **Falihansi:**  Wooden plank, platform or place built over a ditch or ditch.
* **Manchansi:**  Platform, place higher than the ground.
* **Malanshi:**  "Gihovari Malo" - Second floor, etc.
* **Pasayansi:**  "Nijjuha-Gavakkhovasobhito Pasado" - Decorated palace.
* **Hammatalansi:**  "Savvovari Talam" - Peak place or roof.
* **Dubbadh:**  Not properly tied with bamboo or rope.
* **Dunikkhitte:**  Not properly established.
* **Anikampe:**  Unstable - "Anishprakampitvadav Chalachal Chalachalanasvabham"

**Than-Sej-Nisihiyam:**  Charnikar has explained these three words at the beginning and later also explained four words. There, the third word "Nisejj" is said more. But in the Acharanga Sutra and Nishith Uddeshak five, there are only three words. Therefore, here also three words are kept in the original, which includes all the activities to be done in those places - 1. Standing with Kayotsarga or standing without Kayotsarga. 2. Sleeping on any bed. 3. Sitting for study or eating.

The prohibition of doing these activities in the eight places mentioned in the previous sutras is due to the violation of the earth, etc. and in these three sutras, the prohibition is due to the possibility of the monk falling. Because these places are high and uncovered, i.e. open to the sky in all directions. Since these are places without support, there is a possibility of the monk falling or the equipment falling, which can lead to self-violation, destruction of equipment and violation of life. Therefore, one should not stand, sleep, sit, etc. in such places.

Acharanga Shru. 2, A. 2, U. 1 prohibits the monk from staying in such places. If it is necessary to stay in such places, it is instructed to be very careful and also explains the various types of violations that can occur due to carelessness. 

Page #389:
---------------------------
## Thirteenth Uddeshak

[289]

The height of places like space-born platforms, malls, houses, and roofs is clear from their names. Therefore, the term "space-born" should not be interpreted as "high place," but rather as "open sky." This means that if the surrounding area of the high places mentioned in the sutra is not enclosed by walls, but open sky, then they are called "space-born." This meaning is clear from the detailed text on this subject in Praachan Shru. 2, A. 2, U. 1. Because if the high places mentioned in the sutra are enclosed on all sides by walls, then the possibility of falling, etc., mentioned in the sutra would not be logical.

## The Penance for Teaching Skills, etc.

12. A monk who teaches or approves of someone teaching another ascetic or householder: 1. Skills, 2. Praise, 3. Gambling, 4. Dice games, 5. Warfare, 6. Poetry composition, (incurs a minor Chaturmasik penance).

**Explanation:**

* **Sippam:** "Tunnagaadi" = Skills like sewing, etc.
* **Silogam:** "Vannana" = Praise, extolling virtues.
* **Atthavayam:** Gambling with dice, etc.
* **Kakkadayam:** "Kakkadagam-heuu" = A type of game played with dice.
* **Vuggah:** "Vuggaho-kalho" = Fighting, martial arts.
* **Salaha:** "Salaha-kavvakaranappoga" = Poetry composition.

The Churnikaar has also explained "Atthavayam" and "Kakkadayam" in another way, as follows:

* "Imam Attapaadam - Puchchito apuchchito va bhanati - Amhe nimittam na suttha jaanamo. Ettiyam pun jaanamo - Param pabhayakale dadhikuram sunga vi khaatium aichchhihinti, arth padein gyayate subhikkham." = To tell the reason.
* "Kakkadagam-heuu - Jaththa bhanite ubhayha vi dosho bhavati jaha - Jeevass nitchatt pariggrahe naragadi bhavo na bhavati. Anichche va bhanite vinaasi ghatavat kritavipranasadayasch dosha bhavati. Athava karkaat hetu sarvabhaavaikya pratipatti." = To state definitively the various religions that exist in objects.

It should be understood that teaching the activities mentioned in the sutra to a householder is not the conduct of a virtuous person. By implication, the same penance is incurred for teaching the 72 arts, etc. Teaching these things encourages the householder's activities or encourages and approves of worldly activities. It also leads to the loss of the restraints of self-study, meditation, etc.

## The Penance for Speaking Harsh Words to a Householder

13. A monk who speaks harshly to another ascetic or householder, or approves of such speech, (incurs a minor Chaturmasik penance). 

Page #390:
---------------------------
[Nishith Sutra]
13. A monk who speaks harsh words to a non-Jain or a householder, or approves of such speech.
14. A monk who speaks harsh words to a non-Jain or a householder, or approves of such speech.
15. A monk who speaks harsh words with anger to a non-Jain or a householder, or approves of such speech.
16. A monk who insults a non-Jain or a householder in any way, or approves of such insult. (He incurs the minor four-month penance.)

Discussion: A monk is not allowed to speak harsh language at all. For speaking even slightly harsh words, the minor four-month penance is incurred according to Nishith Uddeshak 2 Sutra 19. And for speaking harsh words to a teacher or a Ratnaadhikar, the major four-month penance is mentioned in Uddeshak 10. These present sutras mention the minor four-month penance for speaking harsh words to any householder or for insulting them in any other way. The explanation of the words "Aagaadh" etc. is found in the tenth Uddeshak.

A monk should always speak words that are beneficial to all, limited, and sweet. Whether it is a small monk or a big monk, a small or big householder, or even children, it is not appropriate to speak harsh words to anyone, to scorn them, or to insult them in any way. Doing so corrupts restraint, insulting others is the cause of the arising of passions. Therefore, he is liable to penance according to these sutras.

Speaking harsh language leads to defilement, which binds karma and also becomes the cause of conflict.

The statement about the wisdom regarding language is found in the Dasavaikalik Sutra, chapters 4-6-7-8-10, in Aacha. Shru. 2, chapter 4, and in the Prashnavyakaran Shru. 2, chapter 2, and also in many places in the Uttaradhyayanasutra etc. The observance of the language committee in the five committees is said to be very difficult. Therefore, a monk should always be very careful about his language.

Penance for Curiosity-related Actions
17. A monk who performs a curiosity-related action, or approves of such action.

For further information, refer to the seventh sutra of the tenth Uddeshak. 
##  Praayashchitt for guiding the path
28. Je bhikkhu annautthiyaan wa garatthiyaan wa natthaan, moodhaan, vippariyasiyaan maggam wa paveei, sandhi wa paveei, maggaao wa sandhi paveei, sandhiyo wa maggam paveei, paveent wa saijjai.
28. A bhikkhu who guides the path of other-worldly beings or householders who are lost, confused or have gone in the wrong direction, or who guides the junction of the path, or who guides the junction from the path, or who guides the path from the junction, or who approves of the one who guides, (incurs a laghu-chaturmasik praayashchitt).
##  Vivechan
Shandhi - The place where multiple paths meet or the origin of multiple paths. Maggaao wa sandhi - To tell how far the junction is from the path and where it is. Sandhiyo wa magg - To tell the path to be taken from the junction, to tell its direction.
After guiding the path, the person may go elsewhere due to their own mistake, may be confused in understanding, or the path may seem long, difficult, robbers may come, lions may come, etc. Due to such reasons, various kinds of impure thoughts or wrong perceptions may arise towards the bhikkhu. If there is water, vegetation, or harmful creatures on the path, there may also be opposition to them.
##  Praacha. Shru. 2, A. 3, U. 3
It is stated that if a householder asks a bhikkhu walking in the vihar, "How far is such and such village from here, or how far is the path to such and such village?", then the bhikkhu should not answer, but remain silent or ignore it and move on. Even if he knows, he should not say "I don't know" or "I know but I won't tell", he should simply remain silent with indifference.
The meaning of this rule in the Acharang Sutra is that if the bhikkhu makes a mistake in telling, or if the listener does not understand properly and gets confused, or if the householder gets lost on the path or takes longer on the path, or if it becomes midday or night, or if he becomes distressed due to hunger or thirst, etc., there is a possibility of many faults. Therefore, the bhikkhu should walk with discretion and indifference in such situations. If, due to circumstances or any other reason, he has to guide the path out of concern for the welfare of others, he should guide the path in a discreet language and accept the praayashchitt as prescribed in the sutras.
##  Praayashchitt for telling about dhatu and nidhi
29. Je bhikkhu annautthiyaan wa garatthiyaan wa dhaun pavedei, pavetam wa saijjai. 30. Je bhikkhu annautthiyaan wa garatthiyaan wa nihim pavedei, pavedem wa saijjai.

##  [Nishīth Sūtra 294]

**29.** A monk who reveals the location of a *dhātu* (metal) to non-monks or householders, or approves of someone else doing so.

**30.** A monk who reveals the location of a *nidhi* (treasure) to non-monks or householders, or approves of someone else doing so. (He incurs the *laghu-chaturmāsīka* penance.)

**Discussion:** There are three types of *dhātu*: 1. *Pāṣāṇa-dhātu*, 2. *Rasa-dhātu*, 3. *Miṭṭī-dhātu*.

1. *Pāṣāṇa-dhātu* is obtained by rubbing iron or other metals against a specific stone, resulting in gold or other precious metals.

2. *Rasa-dhātu* is obtained by pouring water containing a specific metal onto copper or other metals, resulting in gold or other precious metals.

3. *Miṭṭī-dhātu* is obtained by mixing a specific type of soil with other substances or rubbing it against iron or other metals, resulting in gold or other precious metals.

A monk should not reveal the location of a *dhātu* or *nidhi* to householders, whether he has learned it from someone else or discovered it himself. Doing so incurs the penance mentioned in the sūtra.

Revealing the location of a *dhātu* or *nidhi* to householders can lead them to engage in various harmful activities, including other sins. Sharing this information with one person can lead to its spread among many, creating a harmful tradition. Keeping this information from some while sharing it with others can lead to attachment and aversion. If someone fails to find the *dhātu* or *nidhi* due to obstacles, it can lead to disbelief. Therefore, monks should avoid these harmful consequences.

Extracting a *nidhi* can lead to harm to living beings, such as earthworms and ants. If the *nidhi* belongs to someone else, it can lead to conflict or punishment.

**Penance for looking at one's reflection in a vessel:**

**31.** A monk who looks at his reflection in a *matta* (vessel made of clay).

**32.** A monk who looks at his reflection in a *adā* (vessel made of wood).

**33.** A monk who looks at his reflection in a *asī* (vessel made of iron).

**34.** A monk who looks at his reflection in a *maṇi* (gemstone).

**35.** A monk who looks at his reflection in a *kuḍ-pāṇa* (vessel made of leather).

**36.** A monk who looks at his reflection in a *telle* (vessel made of oil).

**37.** A monk who looks at his reflection in a *mahu* (vessel made of honey).

**38.** A monk who looks at his reflection in a *sappi* (vessel made of ghee).

**39.** A monk who sees his reflection in **faṇi** (a type of water) or approves of the one who sees it, incurs **dehant** (minor transgression).
**40.** A monk who sees his reflection in **majjā** (marrow) or approves of the one who sees it, incurs **dehant**.
**41.** A monk who sees his reflection in **basā** (a type of water) or approves of the one who sees it, incurs **dehant**.
**31.** A monk who sees his reflection in a **pātra** (bowl) or approves of the one who sees it, incurs **dehant**.
**32.** A monk who sees his reflection in a **arīsa** (mirror) or approves of the one who sees it, incurs **dehant**.
**33.** A monk who sees his reflection in a **tala-vār** (sword) or approves of the one who sees it, incurs **dehant**.
**34.** A monk who sees his reflection in a **maṇi** (jewel) or approves of the one who sees it, incurs **dehant**.
**35.** A monk who sees his reflection in water containing **kuḍe** (dirt) or approves of the one who sees it, incurs **dehant**.
**36.** A monk who sees his reflection in **tel** (oil) or approves of the one who sees it, incurs **dehant**.
**37.** A monk who sees his reflection in **madhu** (honey) or approves of the one who sees it, incurs **dehant**.
**38.** A monk who sees his reflection in **ghī** (clarified butter) or approves of the one who sees it, incurs **dehant**.
**39.** A monk who sees his reflection in **gīle guḍ** (wet jaggery) or approves of the one who sees it, incurs **dehant**.
**40.** A monk who sees his reflection in **madya** (alcohol) or approves of the one who sees it, incurs **dehant**.
**41.** A monk who sees his reflection in **vasā** (fat) or approves of the one who sees it, incurs **laghu-cāturmāsīka prāyaścitta** (minor four-month penance).

**Discussion:** Here, twelve substances are mentioned from twelve sutras, and seeing one's reflection in them incurs penance. The word **pātra** refers to the bowls of monks and the utensils of householders. The **tel**, **ghī**, and **guḍ** mentioned in the sutras could have been consumed as alms. **Madhu** and **vasā** could have been consumed for medicinal purposes. A monk does not consume **tala-vār**, **arīsa**, **madya**, etc., but it is possible to see one's reflection in them when entering the house of a householder for alms. The commentary collects the words from the sutras as follows:

"**Dappana maṇi ābharaṇe, sattha daē bhāyan'antarē ya. Tell - mahu - sappi faṇit, majj - vasā - suttamādīsu.**" (4318)

[This gatha from the Nishīthasūtra collects all the terms except the character, and also mentions that 'maṇi' is an ornament along with 'ābhūṣaṇa' and that 'sutta' refers to sugarcane juice.
The Daśavakālika Sūtra, chapter 3, states that it is improper for a sādhū to look at their reflection in a mirror, etc.
The commentator has pointed out many potential faults in looking at one's face in a mirror, etc. For example, one may become proud of their appearance, develop a desire for objects upon seeing their beauty, become despondent upon seeing their ugliness, learn about hypnotism, etc., or become obsessed with their body, experience joy and sorrow. If a householder, etc., sees a sādhū while they are looking in a mirror, it may lead to the sādhū or the saṅgha being defamed.
Therefore, a bhikṣu should not even think about looking at their face in the things mentioned in the sūtra or in other such places. Instead, they should remain absorbed in the self, practice restraint, and follow the jina's instructions.
Penance for using emetics, etc.
42. A bhikṣu who vomits or approves of someone who vomits. 43. A bhikṣu who uses a purgative or approves of someone who uses a purgative. 44. A bhikṣu who vomits and uses a purgative or approves of someone who does so. 45. A bhikṣu who uses medication even when they are not sick or approves of someone who does so. (They receive the penance of a short cāturmāsīka.)
Discussion: The fourth sūtra mentions the penance for using medication without being sick. The three sūtras about vomiting and using purgatives should be understood in the same way. That is, one should not use any medication without a reason or without being sick. This is the essence of these four sūtras.
Vomiting and using purgatives can be done in the same way as taking medication when there is a reason. This is also a type of treatment.
Using medication without being sick increases the feeling of bodily attachment and decreases the feeling of restraint. Using medication without being sick can also sometimes cause a new illness. Excessive vomiting or using purgatives can even lead to death. If there is no place to perform the ritual of parīṣṭhāpana or if it is too far away, or if there is an obstacle due to a householder being present, there is also a possibility of other illnesses, etc. Obstacle]

If one cannot hold it, then excreting where one is sitting can damage clothes and other things. A householder, upon knowing this, may also show contempt.
The commentator has said in verse 4337 that if someone knows that they will get a certain disease at a certain time and that it cannot be cured by taking a certain medicine, then it is beneficial and appropriate to use the medicine before the disease occurs to avoid great harm or faults. Although the Uttaradhyayanasutra prohibits the use of medicine, if a weak practitioner takes medicine after getting sick, then there is no atonement for it here.

[Thirteenth Uddeshak]
[299
63. A monk who praises or approves of someone who instructs in the initial actions of the unchaste (incurs a minor four-month penance).
Discussion - In the fourth Uddeshak, sutras 39 to 48 describe the penance for a monk who gives or takes his own sadhu to a parshvastha, depressed, kusheel, attached, and constant monk. There, in the commentary verses 1828 and 1832, the order 'parshvastha, depressed, kusheel' is accepted. The same order is also in the commentary of those sutras. But in the commentary and commentary of this Uddeshak, the order 'parshvastha, kusheel, depressed' has been accepted and discussed in detail. There is no discussion about why the order is different from the fourth Uddeshak. Therefore, the order of the sutras has been kept according to the commentary of this Uddeshak.
In the present case, there are eighteen sutras of the nine from parshvastha etc. In each of these, penance is said for bowing or praising him. 'Who is not to be bowed to?' This is explained in the commentary verse 4367
"Mūlaguṇa uttaraguṇe, santharāmāṇa vi je pamāenti.
Te hota'vandanijjā, taṭṭhāṇārōvaṇā cauro ||" Meaning - Those who, being strong or healthy, carelessly neglect the basic qualities or the advanced qualities, that is, find fault with restraint, use the places of parshvastha etc., are not to be bowed to. Bowing to them incurs a minor four-month penance. That is, those who, due to circumstances, find fault with the basic qualities or the advanced qualities, are not to be bowed to. For detailed information including the discharge, exceptions of bowing or not bowing, one should study the necessary appointment verses 1105 to 1200.
The commentary of the present sutra also describes the subject of exceptions as follows:
"Vandan vises karanā ime
Pariyāya paris purisam, khett kālam ca āgamaṁ gāuṁ. Karan jāte jāte, jahārihaṁ jassa jaṁ joggaṁ. Vayāe-ṇamokkāro, hatthusseho ya sīsanamaṇam ca. Sampucchhaṇaṁ, acchhaṇaṁ, chhob vandaṇaṁ, vandaṇaṁ vā || Eyāiṁ akuvvanto, jahārihaṁ ariha desie magge.
Na bhava'i pavayaṇa bhakti, abhattimaṁtādiyā dosā || Ga. 4372-74 Meaning - Knowing any reason like initiation, assembly, person, field, time, knowledge of scriptures etc., one should also properly say 'mattha'eṇa vandāmi', join hands, bow one's head, ask politely etc. to those who are devoid of the qualities of conduct. Because, in the reign of Arihant Bhagwan, a monk who does not behave properly even with treatment does not have devotion to the sermon, but only lack of devotion and many other faults. 

Page #400:
---------------------------
[300]
One should not bow down to those who are not worthy of being bowed down to, even if they are mother, father, guru, king, or anyone else.
A wise muni, who is well-established in meditation, restrained, endowed with the five samitis and three guptis, and who is far from non-restraint, should be bowed down to.
[Nishīthasūtra
Darshan, knowledge, conduct, austerity, and humility are always present in you.
Those who are harmful to the Jain religion are not worthy of being bowed down to.
[1191]
Meaning: Those who are always in the state of parśvastha, etc., and who are harmful to the Jain religion, are not worthy of being bowed down to.
Bowing down to them or praising them strengthens their state of negligence, and for this reason, atonement is mentioned in these sutras.
Even though they are not worthy of being bowed down to, they may have some praiseworthy qualities, such as intelligence, humility, generosity, devotion, social skills, pleasant speech, eloquence, and pleasantness. However, even if they have these qualities, one should not praise them if they are not striving for restraint, but should remain neutral. If one praises them, the atonement mentioned in the sutras will be incurred.
- Ni. Bha. Ga. 4363-64
1. Kāhiya - (Kāthika) -
The nature of parśvastha, avasanna, kuśīla, samsakta, and nityaka has been discussed in the fourth uddeśaka, and one should learn about it from there.
The nature of kāthika, prekṣaṇīka, māmaka, and samprasārika is as follows:
"Sāj઼jhāyādi karaṇijje jōge mōttu jō desakahāadi kahāto kaheti sō "kāhiō" ।"
One who keeps telling stories like desakathā, etc., while neglecting necessary duties like svādhyāya, etc., is called a 'kāthika'. - Cūrṇi Bha. 3, p. 398
One who tells religious stories for the sake of food, clothing, utensils, fame, or worship, or one who always keeps telling religious stories, is also called a 'kāthika'. - Bha. Ga. 4353
If one keeps telling religious stories without paying attention to time, then one cannot perform pratilekhan, pratikramṇa, svādhyāya, dhyāna, etc., at the appropriate time, which leads to the restrained life being polluted by many faults.

Page #401:
---------------------------
## Thirteenth Uddeshak

[301]

1. **Kaathik:** One who spends time in idle talk, narrates religious stories for the sake of praise, and constantly engages in religious storytelling is called a 'Kaathik'.

2. **Paasaniy (Prekshanik):** One who observes worldly affairs, like watching plays, dances, etc., is called a 'Paasaniy' (observer). This is because such observation leads to the neglect of self-restraint, the goal of liberation, and the teachings of the Jinas. (Churni)

Alternatively, one who answers or teaches about worldly matters, engages in curiosity by explaining complex riddles and stories, is also called a 'Paasaniy'. (Churni) The second definition implies 'Kushila', therefore the first definition is more relevant here.

3. **Mamak:** "One who acts with 'Mami' (mine-ness) is a 'Mamak'."

**Gatha:** "He consumes food, enjoys pleasures, and resides in his family and village. He is attached to his possessions and considers them his own. He is a 'Mamak'." (4359)

**Meaning:** One who is attached to food, does not share, does not invite others, is possessive of his belongings, does not allow others to touch his title, is attached to his body, seeks only comfort and does not endure any hardship. He claims ownership over his study and meditation spaces, prohibiting others from sitting there. He claims ownership over his house, sleeping place, sitting place, and other belongings, not allowing others to use them. He considers his house, village, etc., as his own, believing that no one else can enter them. Such a person, with the thought of "My village, my house, my belongings", is called a 'Mamak'. Because attachment is forbidden for a Sadhu.

**Verses against attachment:**

1. "Even in one's own body, one should not think 'mine'." (Dasha. Pra. 6, Ga. 22)
2. "The monk, who has conquered his senses, is like a tamed elephant. No one can harm him. There is no death for the liberated soul. Therefore, follow the path of self-control." (Aacha. Shru 1, Pra. 2, U. 6)
3. "One who abandons attachment, truly conquers attachment. The liberated soul, who has no attachment, is like a mountain." (Uttara Pra 2, Ga. 27)

A Muni, who is free from attachment to any object, village, house, body, title, etc., is truly the one who understands and knows the path of liberation.

## Nishīthসূত্র

**[Nishīthসূত্র]**

A Muni who, disregarding these many pronouncements of the Āgamas, and with diminished restraint or dispassion, develops attachment to the aforementioned substances, quarrels because of them, or becomes pacified, is called a **Māmaka**. [4. "**Samprāsārika**" 302]

**Meaning:** A householder is called a **Samprāsārika**.

**Ajāṇa Bhikkhu, Kajje Asanjamdhyavatteṣu. Jo Deti Samattham, Sampāsārō U Nāyavvō.**

One who, being involved in worldly affairs, advises householders, either when asked or without being asked, saying, "Do this," "Don't do that," "Doing this will cause great harm," "Do as I say," is called a **Samprāsārika**. - Bhā. Gā. 4361

**-Bhāṣya Gā. 4361**

One who participates in or contributes to worldly affairs, either to a small or large extent.

**Examples:**

1. Giving an auspicious time for a foreign journey.
2. Giving an auspicious time for returning from a foreign journey.
3. Giving an auspicious time for starting a business or taking up a job.
4. Advising someone to lend money at interest or not.
5. Giving auspicious times for worldly events like marriage.
6. Predicting the future of a business by giving auspicious signs from the scriptures, indicating a bull or bear market, and saying, "Buy this," "Sell that," etc.

Such a person is also called a **Samprāsārika**.

One who participates in worldly affairs of householders to a lesser or greater extent - Chūrṇi Bhāg 3, Gā. 4362

**Pārśvasthādi Nau** and the tenth **Uddeshaka**, as described in the **Yathāchanda**, are collectively called the ten **Dūṣita Prachāra** (corrupt propagators). According to the **Gama**, they are also classified into three categories: 1. **Utkṛṣṭa Dūṣita Chāritra** (highly corrupt character), 2. **Madhyama Dūṣita Chāritra** (moderately corrupt character), 3. **Jighanya Dūṣita Chāritra** (extremely corrupt character).

1. The first category includes **Yathāchanda**. Along with it, **Vandanavyavahāra** (exchange of greetings), **Āhāra** (food), **Vastra** (clothing), **Shiṣya** (disciple), etc., the exchange of **Guṇagrāma** (virtuous qualities), giving and receiving **Vāchanā** (scriptural teachings), and the **Guruchaumāsī Prāyaśchitta** (penance) are included.
2. The second category includes **Pārśvastha**, **Avasanna**, **Kuśīla**, **Sansakta**, and **Nityaka**. Along with them, **Vandanavyavahāra**, **Āhāra**, **Vastra**, etc., the exchange of **Guṇagrāma**, giving and receiving **Vāchanā**, and the **Laghuchaumāsī Prāyaśchitta** (minor penance) are included. The **Laghumāsīka Prāyaśchitta** (minor monthly penance) is included for taking and giving disciples.
3. The third category includes **Kāthika**, **Prekṣaṇīka**, **Māmaka**, and **Samprāsārika**. Along with them, **Vandanavyavahāra**, **Āhāra-Vastra**, etc., the exchange of **Guṇagrāma** and the **Laghu...**

##  [303
Thirteenth Uddeshak]
The four-month penance has arrived. No penance has been mentioned for the disciple's transactions, nor for the Vaanchni transactions.
The first category is impure in its very form. Therefore, being of a form contrary to the Agamas, it is a highly guilty one.
The second category - they commit faults in the observance of Mahavrat, Samiti, and Guptis, and they engage in many subtle and gross corrupt tendencies related to conduct, therefore they are moderately guilty.
The third category - they are those who commit faults in a limited and general conduct and thoughts, therefore they are the least guilty. That is, someone only tells the auspicious time, someone only has attachment, someone only spends time in idle talk, someone keeps looking at scenic places. These four are not major faults, but general faults.
1
The head and eyes are the highest limbs. Feet, fingers, nails, are the lowest limbs. Just as the body's peace or samadhi is disturbed when the lowest limbs are injured, or even when a nail gets stuck in the foot, similarly, even general faults corrupt the restraint and samadhi.
Thus, those of all three categories are called शीतलविहारी (Shithilachari) due to their corrupt conduct, but those who stay away from these states and observe the pure restraint are called उद्यतविहारी (Udyatvihari) विहारी (Shuddhachari).
Shuddhachari - one who fully observes all the conduct mentioned in the Agamas. If, for some reason, they consume a fault as an exception, they accept its penance. When the reason is over, they abandon that tendency and adopt the pure form of the conduct mentioned in the Agamas, they are called 'Shuddhachari'.
Shithilachari - one who always conducts themselves contrary to the conduct mentioned in the Agamas, does not have the discernment of the state of Utsarga and exception, does not take penance for the contrary conduct, or adopts a form contrary to the conduct mentioned in the Agamas, they are called 'Shithilachari'.
Apart from the rules and prohibitions mentioned in the Agamas, it is not appropriate to consider someone as Shuddhachari or Shithilachari based on the observance or non-observance of any community's Samachari, which is formed from the perspective of area, time, etc. But those who live in a community must follow those rules according to the orders of that Sangha. If they do not follow them, they are eligible for penance.
Some rules of the prevalent Samachari, in addition to the Agamic rules:
Food.
1. Do not take processed roots and tubers, butter, food made the previous day, and biscuits, etc.
2. Do not combine raw yogurt and legumes, and do not eat such food

[305 etc. In different Gachch communities, many rules have been made which are in addition to the Paagam Vidhanas and have been made from time to time according to their own expectations. It is not appropriate to relate them to the definition of Shithilachar or Shuddhachar. Because these are only traditions, not Paagamokta rules.

Those who consume these 78 places mentioned in the sūtra incur the Laghu-Caturmāsī prāyaścitta.
Discussion- Obtaining food by a monk through many corrupt practices is called production defect. The number of these defects in Piṇḍa-niyukti is said to be sixteen. Here, the prāyaścitta of fourteen of these defects has been mentioned, and the prāyaścitta of 'AntarDhāna-piṇḍa' has been mentioned separately. This can be included in Yoga-piṇḍa.
Dhātṛ-piṇḍa- The duties of a Dhātṛ are of five types: 1. Feeding the child milk, 2. Bathing the child, 3. Dressing the child in clothes and ornaments, 4. Feeding the child, 5. Holding the child in the lap or armpit. Obtaining food from a householder by performing these duties is called 'Dhātṛ-piṇḍa' defect.
Dūtī-piṇḍa- Obtaining food, etc., by talking about things here and there to each other or by exchanging news of relatives.
Ājīvika-piṇḍa- Obtaining food by introducing oneself by caste, family, etc., or by telling one's own qualities.

Page #407:
---------------------------
## Thirteenth Uddeshak

[307] Taking food, etc., by being angry with the householder or by threatening to curse them if they don't give food, etc.
Taking alms by saying, "I will take alms," when the householder refuses to give alms, and then using cleverness to obtain alms from another member of the household.
Obtaining alms by deceitfully changing one's form (Maya-pinda).
Taking more than what is needed when the desired item is available, or wandering around until the desired item is found, and not accepting any other imaginable item (Lopi-pinda).
Obtaining alms by suggesting the use of medicine, etc., for a disease, either when asked by the householder or without being asked, or by saying, "My such and such disease was cured by such and such medicine or physician," is called Chikitsa-pinda.
Obtaining food through the use of knowledge, mantras, powders, or yoga, obtaining food while remaining invisible, and obtaining food by giving a reason, are also faults of "Utpādana" and result in a Laghu-Chaumasi Prāyaścitta. The explanation of the terms "Vidya" etc. is given in this Uddeshak, one should understand it from there.
If the giver becomes favorable to these faults, he may accuse the monk of "Udgaman" fault, and if he becomes unfavorable, he may neglect or criticize the monk, which will bring disrepute to Dharma and the Jain teachings.
These fifteen faults mentioned in these fifteen sutras involve "Dina-vṛtti" (dependence on others). While a monk is said to always follow "A-dina-vṛtti" (independence) and "Eṣaṇa-samiti" (balance in needs), therefore, he should not even think of obtaining food through these tendencies.
The author of the Niyukti-kāra has stated the "Mūla-karma" fault of "Utpādana" as resulting in a Guru-Chaumasi Prāyaścitta, and the "Pūrva-paścāt-sanstava-doṣa" as resulting in a Laghu-Māsika Prāyaścitta in the second Uddeshak. The remaining faults of "Utpādana" are stated in these sutras as resulting in a Laghu-Chaumasi Prāyaścitta.
Summary of the Thirteenth Uddeshak:
18. Standing, sitting, or sleeping on the earth near the surface, on smooth, moist, earth mixed with dust, on earth mixed with mud, on earth, on stone or rock, and on wood or earth containing living beings.
9-11. Standing, sitting, or sleeping on high places without being covered by a wall, etc.
13-16. Teaching a householder a craft, etc., speaking harshly or rudely to a householder, or causing him anxiety in any other way.

## The Prāyaścitta for Buying, Receiving, etc., a Pātra

1. A monk who buys a pātra, causes it to be bought, accepts a pātra that is being given as bought, or approves of the acceptance of such a pātra, incurs a minor prāyaścitta.
2. A monk who borrows a pātra, causes it to be borrowed, accepts a pātra that is being given as borrowed, or approves of the acceptance of such a pātra, incurs a minor prāyaścitta.
3. A monk who exchanges a pātra for another pātra belonging to a householder, causes it to be exchanged, accepts a pātra that is being given as exchanged, or approves of the acceptance of such a pātra, incurs a minor prāyaścitta.
4. A monk who accepts a pātra that is given by force, given without the consent of one of the two owners, or given in front of him, or approves of the acceptance of such a pātra, incurs a minor prāyaścitta.

**Discussion:** These four sūtras describe the prāyaścitta for six types of pātra-related offenses. The six offenses are:

1. **Krita:** A pātra that is bought.
2. **Prāmritya:** A pātra that is borrowed.
3. **Parivartita:** A pātra that is exchanged.
4. **Ācchinnha:** A pātra that is taken by force.
5. **Anisṛṣṭa:** A pātra that is given without the consent of the co-owner.
6. **Abhihata:** A pātra that is brought from home and given to the āśrama. 

Page #411:
---------------------------
## Fourteenth Uddeshak

[311] The first, second, and third sutras describe the atonement for the three origin-defects of *krita*, *adi*, and *tritya*, respectively. The fourth sutra describes the atonement for the remaining three origin-defects together.

A sadhu buying a vessel from a vessel-seller and paying the price to the vessel-seller from a devotee householder, this is considered the sadhu buying the vessel.

A sadhu asking a devotee householder to buy a vessel and bring it to him, this is considered the sadhu having the vessel bought.

Similarly, borrowing, lending, and exchanging, and having these done, should also be understood in the same way.

These three defects are forms of transgression of the *parigraha* mahavrata.

The atonement for the remaining three defects is said to be done by the householder, because it is not possible for a sadhu to commit these defects.

Or, if someone perhaps commits such an unbridled act, then the *laghu-chaumasi* atonement mentioned in the present sutra does not apply to him, but the *guru-chaumasi* atonement applies.

The consumption of the *achchhinna* defect is a form of transgression of the first and third mahavrata. The consumption of the *anisrusht* defect is a form of transgression of the third mahavrata. The consumption of the *abhihad* defect is a form of transgression of the first mahavrata. These six defects are called the origin-defects of *eshana-samiti*.

1. A *krita-bhikshu* is a complete renunciant of *parigraha*, therefore buying and selling is not his conduct. He obtains necessary requisites and food only through *bhiksha*. Uttara. A. 35, Ga. 13-15 states that:

A bhikshu should not even desire gold and silver in his mind, he should see stone and gold with equal vision, and refrain from the tendency to buy and sell.

The buyer is the customer (buyer) and the seller is the merchant. Even if a bhikshu engages in buying and selling, he is not a transgressor of *jina-agna*.

Therefore, a bhikshu who lives by *bhiksha* should obtain every object only through *bhiksha*, but should not buy. Because buying and selling is a great sin for a bhikshu, and *bhiksha* is a great source of happiness. - Uttara. A. 35 Ga. 13-15.

Dasavai. A. 3, Ga. 3 states that it is considered misconduct for a bhikshu to accept an object bought by a householder with the intention of giving it to a sadhu, i.e., an object tainted with the *krita* defect.

Dasavai. A. 6, Ga. 48 states that "A bhikshu who consumes food etc. tainted with the *krita* etc. defects is an approver of the sin that occurs in the making of that substance." This is the third type of approval. There are three types of approval... 

Page #412:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**[312]**

1. To understand well with the mind.
2. To speak well with words.
3. To accept it with the body, meaning to use it.

Therefore, if a monk does not take the items made or bought for him, he is not considered to have any fault. If he takes it and uses it, then the fault of bodily acceptance arises.

[Nishīthasūtra, Āchā. Śru. 2, A. 6 states that if a householder takes for his own use the vessel bought for a monk, who did not take it, then later on, the same monk can take that vessel. Because that vessel has become "puruṣāntarakṛta".]

[Āchā. Śru. 2, A. 1, U. 1 states that a vessel made "puruṣāntarakṛta" in this way cannot be used to take water.]

[Uttara. A. 20, Gā. 47 calls a monk who consumes things with the faults of prauddeśika, krīta, etc., as sarvabhakshi (omnivorous).]

Therefore, a monk should not have the tendency to buy things, and he should not accept items bought for him.

**Prāmritya** - If a monk borrows a vessel from someone and later the householder pays for it, then this kind of tendency should also not be adopted by the monk. Doing so leads to a chain of many faults and can even lead to disrespect for Dharma.

If a householder brings a vessel, etc., for a monk on loan, then it is not considered appropriate to accept it. This is also a fault of eṣaṇā. If the householder who brought it on loan is unable to pay for it due to circumstances, then he may become a great debtor. Therefore, such a faulty vessel is unacceptable for a monk.

**Parivartita** - Giving one's own vessel and taking another vessel in exchange from a householder is called "parivartan" (exchange). It is not considered appropriate for a monk to do this himself or to have it done. And if a householder gives a vessel to a monk after exchanging it with another householder, then accepting such a vessel is also faulty. Doing so may anger the family members and relatives of that family. If the vessel given by the monk to the householder breaks when taken home, then the householder may suspect that "he must have given me a broken vessel." If someone becomes ill or dies after consuming food, etc., in that vessel, then due to delusion, there may be hatred towards the monk, which can lead to many other misfortunes. Therefore, a monk should not exchange vessels with a householder himself, and even if a devout householder gives a vessel after exchanging it, the monk should not accept it.

[Āchā. Śru. 2, A. 5 and 6, U. 2 states that "a monk should not exchange vessels, etc., with another monk either."]

**Āchhin** - If a powerful person uses the influence of his power to pressure a weak person and takes a vessel from him by force, and gives that vessel to a monk or has it given to him, then that... 

Page #413:
---------------------------
## Fourteenth Uddeshak

**[313 "Prachhinna" is faulty.** Because taking it causes suffering to the weak person, he may sometimes, out of hatred, snatch, break, or otherwise harm the sadhu's vessel.

**Anisrishta -** If there are many partners who own a vessel, and one partner wants to give it, but the other partners do not want to give it, and the sadhu is given the vessel without their permission, then that vessel is considered to have the Anisrishta fault.

**Or** if a servant gives it without the master's consent, or a member of the household gives it without the head of the household's consent, then that vessel is also considered to have the Anisrishta fault.

Taking such a vessel can lead to increased suffering later, and someone may come to demand the vessel back from the sadhu, or may cause other harm. Obtaining such vessels in the future may become difficult.

**Abhihit -** If a householder brings a vessel from his home and gives it to the upashraya, or brings a vessel for the sadhu from another place or village and keeps it at home, then that vessel is considered to have the "Abhihit" fault. Taking such a vessel implies approval of the harm caused to living beings on the way. In Dashava. A. 3, this is called anachaar. A person walking or traveling by vehicle harms both moving and stationary beings, and rain or a river may also come on the way. The person who brings it...

...may also bring a vessel with other faults. Therefore, one should not take a vessel brought from the front.

Of these six faults, two are called anachaar in Dashava. A. 3. Except for the "Parivartita" fault, the remaining five are also called "Sabaldosha" in Dashava. D. 2. In Praacha. Shru. 2, A. 1-2-5-6, etc., it is forbidden to take food, clothing, or vessels with these five faults.

Therefore, knowing these six as faults of origin, one should abandon them. If one has to take a vessel with these faults in a particular situation, then one incurs the Laghuchaumasik pratyashchit.

**Pratyashchit for giving an extra vessel without the permission of the Garani**

**5. Je bhikkhu airegapadiddiggham gani uddisiya, gani samuddisiya, tam gani anapucchiya anamantiya annamannassa viyarai, viyarantan va saijjai.**

**5. A bhikkhu who takes an extra vessel for the Gani, and gives it to someone else without asking the Gani or inviting him, or approves of the giver.** [He incurs the Laghuchaaturmasik pratyashchit.]

**Discussion -** Bhikkhus do not find all the desirable and suitable wooden vessels everywhere. Vessels made of Tumbe are not readily available everywhere, and earthen vessels are readily available everywhere, but they are not convenient. They are sometimes used in special circumstances. 

Page #414:
---------------------------
[314]
[Nishith Sutra]
While wandering where wooden vessels are readily available, if a monk is staying with the Acharya or is going to wander there, some extra vessels are requested for the needs of the Gachchha. Sometimes, monks can be sent to bring vessels only if it is absolutely necessary. If more vessels are found than the number requested and it is deemed appropriate, he can bring them, but it is not permissible to give them to anyone without the Acharya's permission. If another monk is encountered on the way while going, and he says that if more are available, then bring some vessels for me too. At that time, if the Acharya is nearby, then one should bring them only after taking his permission. If the Acharya is far away, then one can bring them without permission, but after bringing them, one should give them to the one who requested them only after taking the Acharya's permission. Giving them to anyone without informing them and without asking them incurs the pratyashchittam mentioned in the sutras.
The commentator has also explained that if it is considered necessary to give vessels to a sadhu due to his special circumstances on the way, then the Gītartha sadhu can also decide and give the vessels himself and later inform the Acharya about giving the vessels.
If there are many Acharyas, many Vachanacharyas, Pravrajanaacharyas, etc. in a Gachchha, then generally bringing vessels by instructing the Acharya is 'Uddesha' and bringing vessels by instructing a particular Acharya is 'Samuddesha'.
Giving the extra vessels brought to the Acharya is 'Samarpit karna-dena' and inviting him is 'Nimantaran'. If it is to be given to someone else, then obtaining permission for it is 'Pricchana'.
Vyavahar Sutra Uddesa 8 describes the practice of bringing such extra vessels from a distant area. There is a general practice of bringing vessels for each other, and it is also forbidden to give vessels to anyone without asking the Gani or without inviting them. It is prescribed to ask them, invite them, and then give them to others. The present sutra mentions the pratyashchittam for bringing and giving vessels without the Gani's permission. Pratyashchittam for giving or not giving extra vessels
6. The monk who gives or approves of giving extra vessels to a young sadhu-sadhvi, or to an old sadhu-sadhvi, whose hands, feet, ears, nose, lips are not cut off, who is strong.
7. The monk who does not give or approve of giving extra vessels to a young sadhu-sadhvi, or to an old sadhu-sadhvi, whose hands, feet, ears, nose, lips are not cut off, who is strong. 

Page #415:
---------------------------
## Fourteenth Uddeshak]
[315
7. A monk who does not allow or approves of not allowing an extra vessel for a young sadhu-sadhvi or an old sadhu-sadhvi whose hands, feet, ears, nose, lips are cut off or who is disabled (he incurs a small Chaturmasik pratyachit).
Discussion- The previous sutra describes the general vessels brought in excess of need. These sutras describe giving more vessels than the Kalpmaryada.
Bhashya gatha 4524 and its Chuni state that two types of vessels are allowed by the Tirthankaras, namely- 1. Vessel, 2. Matrak. Apart from this, taking a third vessel is 'extra vessel'. See the discussion on the number of vessels and matraks in the sixteenth Uddeshak.
Khadak-Khuddika- Sadhus or Sadhvis from the age of nine to sixteen years are called children. They are called 'Khuddhag' or 'Dahar' in the Pagam.
Ther-Sthavir- Sthavir are said to be of three types- 1. By age, 2. By knowledge, 3. By restraint paryay. Here, only the Sthavir of 60 years of age should be understood.
Hatyachchhinna etc.- The sutra states that the hands, feet, lips, nose and ears are cut off. This means that they are disabled in any way, such as blind, deaf, lame, etc. Although such disabled people are not given initiation, but even after taking restraint, someone may become disabled due to some reason, this statement should be understood in this context.
Asak-Ashakta- A monk who is not disabled but is weak, i.e. tired from continuous travel, surrounded by illness or frightened by some other ordeal, is called weak here.
The meaning of this sutra can be interpreted in two ways:
1. A young or old sadhu-sadhvi who is disabled or weak can be given an extra vessel, but a young sadhu-sadhvi and an able-bodied, non-disabled child-old person cannot be given an extra vessel.
2. From the statement of the beginning and the end, the middle is accepted, according to this logic, any sadhu-sadhvi, young or old, who is disabled or weak can be given an extra vessel, but not a strong and non-disabled one. Because disabled or diseased, young sadhu-sadhvis are also worthy of compassion like children and old people. Even a young person becomes weak due to illness, etc.
The reason for giving an extra vessel to the disabled and the weak is that it is necessary for their medication, diet, etc. Separate vessels are needed for defecation, urination or phlegm, etc., or due to disability or weakness, the vessel is more likely to break and he cannot bring it himself, then he can do his work with the extra vessel. 

Page #416:
---------------------------
##  [316]
The rules for atonement in both these sutras are for the head of the gana. They are the ones who must decide which sadhu or sadhvi is worthy of receiving additional possessions and which are not. The atonement for keeping an unworthy possession and rejecting a worthy one is:

8. The bhikkhu who keeps or approves of keeping a possession that is unsuitable for use, unstable, not durable, and not fit to be kept.
9. The bhikkhu who does not keep or approves of not keeping a possession that is suitable for use, stable, durable, and fit to be kept. 
(He incurs the atonement of a short chaturmas.)

**Discussion:** All types of equipment, including possessions, should be used as long as they are usable. It is not appropriate to discard them or leave them with a householder. Even if a possession becomes damaged or breaks while in use, it should not be discarded or left behind as long as it remains usable.

If a possession is no longer usable, if transcription or livelihood cannot be fully carried out, or if there are more than three straps or bindings, then it is not appropriate to keep that possession.

Keeping a possession that is no longer usable can lead to attachment to it, such as thinking, "This is my initiation possession." However, a bhikkhu should renounce such attachment and discard it.

These two sutras state that the atonement for discarding a usable possession and keeping an unusable one is a short chaturmas. The atonement for adding and keeping more straps or bindings is mentioned in the first uddeśaka.

See the fifth uddeśaka for a discussion of the words "aṇalaṁ" etc. used in the sutra. The atonement for changing the color of a possession is:

10. The bhikkhu who makes a possession of good color discolored or approves of doing so.
11. The bhikkhu who makes a discolored possession of good color or approves of doing so.

[317 Discussion-worthy] If a bowl is ugly in appearance but usable, one should not make any effort to make it beautiful.
If a bowl is found to be very beautiful, one should not try to make it ugly out of the feeling that someone else might ask for it or the Acharya might take it for himself or someone might steal it.
Both types of resolutions and efforts are unnecessary in the practice of restraint. Therefore, a monk should not engage in such tendencies.

[Nishīthasūtra 14. A monk who, thinking, "I have not received a new vessel," applies a coating of lodhra, either little or much, or of any color, to the vessel once or repeatedly, or approves of the one who applies the coating.
15. A monk who, thinking, "I have not received a new vessel," applies a coating of lodhra, of any color, that has been kept overnight, to the vessel once or repeatedly, or approves of the one who applies the coating.

19. A monk who, thinking, "I have received a vessel that has a foul odor," applies a coating of lodhra, of any color, that has been kept overnight, to the vessel once or repeatedly, or approves of the one who applies the coating. (He incurs the minor Chaturmasika prāyaścitta.)
Discussion-When a monk is searching for a vessel, he should take one that does not require any kind of processing. Even if, while searching, he finds a very old vessel or a vessel with an unpleasant odor, he should not be inclined to wash it or make it fragrant.
Here, in the first and third sūtras, the prāyaścitta is stated for washing with a little or much water, or for making fragrant with a paste, etc. After that, in the second and fourth sūtras, the prāyaścitta is stated for washing with water that has been kept for many days, or for making fragrant with a paste, etc.
The meaning is that if it is not at all unfavorable for restraint or health, then one should not wash or make fragrant with a little or much water, or with a paste, etc. But if it is necessary to wash, then one should not wash for many days, and one should not keep the substances used for washing and making fragrant in the vessel overnight.
The commentator has said that if the vessel is affected by a poisonous substance or a mantra, or if it has the smell of alcohol, etc., then, as an exception, it can be purified by keeping a paste, etc., or water in it for many days. Or sometimes it can be purified with alkaline substances.
These sūtras state the prāyaścitta for washing, etc., without reason, and for washing, etc., with stale substances kept overnight when there is a reason. There are a total of eight sūtras here - four for old vessels and four for vessels with a foul odor.

[319 The Bhāṣya Cūrṇikār has explained only these sūtras. It does not seem possible to have more sūtras.
In the available manuscripts, four more sūtras are found after Teladi, making a total of 12 sūtras. Some manuscripts also include sūtras for fragrant and new vessels. Thus, these sūtras are found in many different ways and in different numbers. The lowest number is 8 and the highest number is 26. These seem to have been added later after the Bhāṣya Cūrṇikār, and the reason for this is also unknown.
In the sūtra text, "Bahudesieṇ" and "Bahudevasieṇ" are similar words, so it seems that there may have been a scribal error here. The following Bhāṣya-Cūrṇi passages are useful in deciding the sūtra text:
Dag kakkādi aṇave, tehi bahudesitehi je pādam.
Emev ya duggandha, dhuvaṇ-uvaṭeṇt āṇādi ||4642|| . Sutțe bahudeseṇ vā pādo, bahudevasiteṇ vā. Ekkā pasali do vā tiṇṇi vā pasaliyo deso bhaṇṇati, tiṇhaṁ pareṇ bahudeso bhaṇṇati. Aṇāhārādi kakkeṇ vā saṁvāsiteṇ, ettha ega rāti saṁvāsitam taṁ pi bahudevasiyam bhavati.
Bitiya sutțe esevaṭṭho gavaraṁ-bahudevasitehiṁ sīoda-usiṇodehi vatavvaṁ. Tatiya sutțe kakko, cauṭṭha sutțe kakkādiehi cev bahudevasiehiṁ. Jahā aṇavapāde cauro sutṭā bhaṇitā tahā duggandhe vi cauro sutṭā bhaṇiyavvā.
From these explanations, it becomes clear that the first four sūtras are in relation to an old vessel. Of these, the first two sūtras are about washing with water, and the last two are about applying paste, etc. Similarly, the next four sūtras are in relation to a foul-smelling vessel. There are a total of eight sūtras. In the first sūtra, the word "Bahudesieṇ" is used, and in the second sūtra, the word "Bahudevasieṇ" is used. This is also clear from the Cūrṇi. Therefore, these eight sūtras have been placed in the original text in this order.

## Fourteenth Uddesaka

**[321 27. A monk who dries his bowl on wood containing termites and other living beings, or on a place containing eggs, or on a place containing a spider web, or who approves of someone doing so.**

**28. A monk who dries his bowl on a pillar, a threshold, a mortar, or a bathing platform, or on any other such aerial place that is not properly secured or is movable, or who approves of someone doing so.**

**29. A monk who dries his bowl on a mud wall, a brick wall, a stone, or a stone slab, or on any other such aerial place that is not properly secured or is movable, or who approves of someone doing so.**

**30. A monk who dries his bowl on a shoulder, or on the roof of a palace, or on any other such aerial place that is not properly secured or is movable, or who approves of someone doing so. [He incurs the minor Chaturmasika Pratikramana].**

**Discussion:** In the Pancha. Shru. 2, A. 6, U. 1, it is stated that drying the bowl in eleven places is prohibited. Of these, eight places are prohibited only due to the killing of living beings, and the remaining three places, in addition to the killing of living beings, also have the possibility of the bowl breaking if it falls, and the monk falling. Therefore, the bowl can be dried in a safe place where it will not fall from above.

In the previous Sutra, the Pratikramana for washing the bowl is mentioned. If there is a need to dry it in the sun after washing due to some special reason, then the Pratikramana for drying it in unsuitable places is mentioned here.

The special meanings and discussions of the words used in these eleven Sutras have been given in the eleven Sutras at the beginning of the thirteenth Uddesaka. There, the Pratikramana for standing or staying in those places is mentioned. Here, the Pratikramana for drying the bowl in those same places is mentioned. Similarly, the Pratikramana for excreting and drying clothes in these eleven places is mentioned in the sixteenth and eighteenth Uddesakas. The eleven Sutras are the same everywhere.

**Pratikramana for taking the bowl after removing the living beings, etc.**

**31. A monk who takes the bowl after removing the living beings, or who causes them to be removed, or who takes the bowl while they are being removed, or who approves of someone doing so.**

**32. A monk who takes the bowl after removing the seeds, or who causes them to be removed, or who takes the bowl while they are being removed, or who approves of someone doing so.**

**33. A monk who takes the bowl after removing the roots, leaves, flowers, or fruits, or who causes them to be removed, or who takes the bowl while they are being removed, or who approves of someone doing so.**

## Nishīthasūtra 
**34.** A monk who takes, causes to be taken, accepts, or approves of the taking of a *paḍiggaha* containing a *pṛthvīkāya* with life in it.
**35.** A monk who takes, causes to be taken, accepts, or approves of the taking of a *paḍiggaha* containing an *apkāya* with life in it.
**36.** A monk who takes, causes to be taken, accepts, or approves of the taking of a *paḍiggaha* containing an *agnikāya* with life in it.
**31.** A monk who takes, causes to be taken, accepts, or approves of the taking of a *paḍiggaha* containing *trasa* beings.
**32.** A monk who takes, causes to be taken, accepts, or approves of the taking of a *paḍiggaha* containing grains like wheat, or seeds like cumin.
**33.** A monk who takes, causes to be taken, accepts, or approves of the taking of a *paḍiggaha* containing roots, stems, leaves, flowers, or fruits with life in them.
**34.** A monk who takes, causes to be taken, accepts, or approves of the taking of a *paḍiggaha* containing a *pṛthvīkāya* with life in it.
**35.** A monk who takes, causes to be taken, accepts, or approves of the taking of a *paḍiggaha* containing an *apkāya* with life in it.
**36.** A monk who takes, causes to be taken, accepts, or approves of the taking of a *paḍiggaha* containing an *agnikāya* with life in it. [He incurs the *laghucāturmāsīka* atonement.]

**Discussion:** When examining a *paḍiggaha*, the following points must be considered:
1. If there are *trasa* beings like spiders, do not take it.
2. If it contains grains or seeds, do not take it.
3. If it contains roots, stems, etc., do not take it.
4. If it contains salt or other *pṛthvīkāya* with life in it, do not take it.
5. If it contains water with life in it, do not take it.
6. If it is an earthen *paḍiggaha* containing fire [like a cucumber, etc.], do not take it.
7. Do not take a *paḍiggaha* by yourself removing these beings or substances.
8. Even if a householder removes them and gives it to you, do not take it.

If one takes a *paḍiggaha* that is not permissible, one incurs the atonement mentioned in these sūtras.

## Fourteenth Uddeshak]
[323
The order of these 6 sutras is available in different ways and there is also variation in the number of sutras. Here the order is kept according to the commentary.
It is not possible to keep fire in a wooden or earthen vessel. Therefore, this statement of atonement for fire should be understood only in relation to an earthen vessel.
In taking such vessels, those beings are transferred and their composition and compression also takes place. Therefore, atonement has been stated for taking such vessels.
Atonement for polishing the vessel
37. Je bhikkhu padiggaham korei, koravei, koriyam ahattta dejjamaanam padiggahaei, padiggahaentam va saijjai.
_37. A monk who polishes a vessel, causes it to be polished, or takes a polished vessel while it is being given, or approves of the one who takes it. [He incurs a minor Chaturmasik atonement.]
Discussion - In the first Uddeshak, there is a statement of atonement for correcting the mouth of the vessel and for making the uneven one even. Atonement has been stated for other actions in this Uddeshak and here in this 37th sutra, atonement has been stated for polishing the vessel. Polishing the vessel is done by digging. The main purpose of doing this is decoration and decoration is prohibited for monks in the Dasha Vaikalik etc. sutras. The commentator has called it "Jhushira dosha" because in the place dug for polishing, the living beings or the food paste cannot be properly cleaned. Therefore, atonement has been stated for doing this.
Atonement for begging for a vessel on the path
38. Je bhikkhu nayagam va, anayagam va, uvasagam va, anuvaasagam va gamantaransin va, gaampahaantaransin va padiggaham obhaasiya-obhaasiya jayai, jayanta va saijjai.
38. A monk who begs for a vessel from his relatives or from others, from an Upasaka or from an Anupasaka, in the village or on the village path, or approves of the one who begs. [He incurs a minor Chaturmasik atonement.]
Discussion - A vessel can also be begged from householders who are related or unrelated. Such householders can be Upasakas or Anupasakas. Therefore, to make it clear, this sutra mentions four types of people, including relatives.
If you want to beg for a vessel from any householder, you should first see if he is in his house or in any other place of his own, then you should beg for the vessel from him at that time. But if he is out of the village or in another village, then you should not beg from him and in the village

[324]
One should not request a bowl from a householder in a place other than their home, even if they encounter them on the road. If they are a devotee, there is a possibility of incurring the fault of importunity. If they are not a devotee, they may become angry and disrespect the monk or refuse to give the bowl even if they have one. Therefore, one should not request a bowl from anyone in a place other than their home or on the road.

It is said:
The penance for requesting a bowl from a householder, etc., while they are sitting in a council.
39. The monk who, while they are sitting in a council, takes a householder, non-householder, upasaka, or anupasaka aside and repeatedly requests a bowl from them, or approves of the one who is requesting, [incurs the penance of a short chaturmasika].

Discussion: The previous sutra states the penance for requesting a bowl from a householder in a place other than their home. This sutra states the penance for requesting a bowl from a householder who is in their own home, but is engaged in conversation with one or more people, or is sitting in a council.

Doing so would interrupt their necessary conversation, and the giver or other people may become angry. It may lead to a lack of faith in the monk or in the Dharma. The giver is busy in conversation, so they may refuse to give the bowl even if they have one. In such a situation, the monk should request the bowl with discretion. If the monk needs the bowl urgently, they should stand in solitude for a while and wait for a suitable opportunity, or request it at another time.

If the householder themselves leaves the conversation and comes to the monk upon hearing of their arrival, then there is no penance as stated in the sutra for requesting a bowl from them with discretion.

The penance for a monk residing for a bowl.
40. The monk who resides for a bowl during the fixed season [winter or summer], or approves of the one who resides, [incurs the penance of a short chaturmasika].
41. The monk who resides for a bowl during the rainy season, or approves of the one who resides, [incurs the penance of a short chaturmasika].

_ The one who serves them incurs the penance of a chaturmasika with the exclusion of the four months.

## Fourteenth Uddeshak]
[325
_ One who consumes the things mentioned in these 41 sutras incurs the minor Chaturmasik pratyakshya.
Discussion- If a monk tells a householder, "We are staying here for the sake of a vessel, or we are observing Chaturmas, therefore, you should give us a good vessel or arrange for one," to make such a determination is to reside for the sake of a vessel, and this is what is called pratyakshya in both sutras.
Perhaps if a monk stays somewhere for a few days due to an extreme need for a vessel and does not engage in appropriate conversation with the householder regarding the vessel, then he does not incur the pratyakshya mentioned in the sutras.
If a monk resolves to stay for the sake of a vessel and engages in appropriate conversation with the householder, but due to fate, a vessel is not found there, then various types of resolutions and alternatives may arise for the monk or the householder. If the householder is attached, he will give or arrange for a vessel even by accusing the monk of various faults, which will violate restraint. Therefore, a monk should not reside in any area with such a resolution.
Summary Sutra of the Fourteenth Uddeshak 1 Buying a vessel or taking a vessel that has been bought,
Borrowing a vessel or taking a borrowed vessel, changing a vessel or taking a changed vessel, a touched vessel, a vessel brought without the knowledge of the partner or a vessel brought in front of them, giving an extra vessel to someone without the permission of the Acharya, giving an extra vessel to the disabled or the able,

The topic of the 14 sutras of this Uddeshak is not mentioned in other Agamas, such as
5-7

- Pracha. Shru. 2, A. 6, U. 1-2
A Bhikshu should not take a Krit, Pramritya, Prachhedya, Anisrusht, or Abhihrut Patra, and should not change the Patra. Only a usable Patra should be taken, not an unusable one. The color should not be changed, the Patra should not be used for other purposes, and the Patra should not be dried in a place containing sentient beings or in the sky.   Pracha. Shru. 2, A. 6, U. 1-2
[ Nishisutra
An extra Patra should not be given to anyone without the knowledge of the Acharya. It should be given to the weak and not to the strong. But in Byav. U. 8, there is a provision for bringing an extra Patra from a distant land.
A Patra containing stationary living beings should not be taken.
The Patra should not be scratched on the top or inside, and a scratched Patra should not be taken.
38-39
40-41
All the sutras of this Uddeshak mention only the atonement related to Patra, and not any other type of atonement. This is the special feature of this Uddeshak.
|| Fourteenth Uddeshak ends ||
A householder should not be taken from another place or from the assembly to request a Patra. He should not stay for a month or for the four months (Masakalp or Chaturmasakalp) for a Patra.

## Fifteenth Uddesaka: Penance for Insulting a Bhikkhu

1. A bhikkhu who speaks harshly to a bhikkhu, or approves of such speech.
2. A bhikkhu who speaks rudely to a bhikkhu, or approves of such speech.
3. A bhikkhu who speaks both harshly and rudely to a bhikkhu, or approves of such speech.
4. A bhikkhu who insults a bhikkhu in any way, or approves of such insult. (He incurs the penance of Laghu-Chaumasika.)

**Discussion:** The first four sutras of the tenth Uddesaka describe the penance for insulting revered gurus, elders, and Ratnaadhikas. It is the duty of every bhikkhu to respect these individuals. However, a bhikkhu should also refrain from speaking disrespectfully or insulting ordinary saints, virtuous women, or sadhus and sadhvis from other gachchas. If a bhikkhu, lacking control over his speech or behavior, engages in such conduct, he deviates from the path of self-discipline and becomes liable for the penance mentioned in the sutras.

The thirteenth Uddesaka similarly describes four sutras outlining the penance for insulting a householder. The first three sutras address the penance for verbal insults, while the fourth sutra encompasses all other forms of insult.

**Penance for Consuming Food with Awareness**

5. A bhikkhu who consumes food with awareness, or approves of such consumption.
6. A bhikkhu who rejects food with awareness, or approves of such rejection.
7. A bhikkhu who consumes food offered by a person with awareness, or approves of such consumption.

## Fifteenth Uddesaka

[329 Nishīthasūtra]

In Ācārāṅgasūtra:
1. Ambaṁ
1. Ambaṁ bhittaṁ 2. Ambaṁ pesi
2. Ambaṁ pesi 3. Ambaṁ bhittaṁ
3. Ambaṁ coyyagaṁ 4. Ambaṁ sālagaṁ
4. Ambaṁ sālagaṁ 5. Ambaṁ dagalaṁ
5. Ambaṁ dagalaṁ 6. Ambaṁ coyyagaṁ

There are also differences in the interpretation of some words in both the Āgams. In Ācārāṅga:
Nishīth: Ambaṁ sālagaṁ = Mango juice
Mango peel Ambaṁ coyyagaṁ = Mango peel
Mango kesara

Again, the word 'Ambaṁ' has many meanings, which the Chūrṇikār has explained as follows:
1. Whole mango, not even slightly broken. 2. In the first set of four sūtras, it is a mango with a bound seed, in the second set of four sūtras, it is a mango with an unbound seed. 3. In the first set of four sūtras, it is an unbroken mango, in the second set of four sūtras, it is a broken mango. 4. In the first set of four sūtras, it is a general statement, in the second set of four sūtras, it is a specific statement.

Looking at these alternatives, it seems that the text of Ācārāṅga is correct and their meanings also seem consistent. In Nishīth, it is possible that the word "Ambaṁ" has been repeated due to a scribal error.

These sūtras state the atonement for eating or sucking a mango with a seed, or for eating a mango with a seed that is bound. Therefore, if the mango is seedless and the seed has been removed, there is no atonement for eating or sucking such a mango.

_Eating means chewing with teeth and sucking means drawing juice into the mouth without chewing with teeth._

See Ācārāṅga Śruta 2, Adhyāya 7, Uddesaka 2 for a detailed description of staying in a mango grove and eating mangoes.

Atonement for getting the body cleaned by a householder
13 to 66. If a monk gets his feet washed or massaged by someone other than a monk or a householder, or approves of someone getting their feet washed or massaged, he should be punished according to the third Uddesaka, just as if a monk gets his head cleaned by someone other than a monk or a householder, or approves of someone getting their head cleaned.

13 to 16. If a monk gets his feet washed or massaged by someone other than a monk or a householder, once or many times, or approves of someone getting their feet washed or massaged, he should be punished according to the third Uddesaka, just as if a monk gets his head cleaned by someone other than a monk or a householder, or approves of someone getting their head cleaned.

[330]
A monk who knows the entire Palapaca, similar to the Nisitha Sutra [Sutras 16 to 69], who covers his head or approves of someone covering their head while traveling from village to village with a non-Jain or householder, [receives the Laghu Chaumasi Pratikramana].
Discussion - If a monk has a householder perform bodily care for him, he receives the Pratikramana as stated in the Sutra. Here, the discussion of 54 Sutras should be understood as similar to the third Uddeśaka. Pratikramana for excreting in unallowable places
67. A monk who excretes or approves of someone excreting in a Dharmasala, a garden, a house of a story teller, or a hermitage.

75. A monk who abandons excrement or approves of someone doing so in a bull hall, a bull house, a mahakula, or a mahagriha. [He incurs the laghuchoumasi pratyachitta.]

**Discussion:** - These nine sutras mention 46 places. Some of these places are individual and some are public. These places also have owners or protectors. It is completely forbidden to abandon excrement in such places. Therefore, abandoning excrement in such places causes a fault in the third mahavrata of the monk, and if the monk is aware of it, it also leads to the condemnation of all monks and the sangha. There can also be many types of rude behavior.

**Civility and foolishness are revealed when someone is angered, along with the behavior of the monk.**

Therefore, a monk should not abandon excrement in the places mentioned in the sutras.

If any of these public places have become places for people to abandon excrement, then there is no pratyachitta for a monk to abandon excrement in that place in a proper manner.

If the owner of any individual place has given permission to the monks to abandon excrement in it, then the monk can abandon excrement in a suitable place devoid of living beings, with discretion. There is no pratyachitta mentioned in the sutras for abandoning excrement in that place, which has been granted permission.

In the third uddeshak, there is also mention of pratyachitta related to abandoning excrement in many places. The pratyachitta mentioned there is also in the same spirit.

In such places, although the words "uccar" and "prasravan" are used to indicate excrement,

##  [Nishiy Sutra 332]

Although, primarily, one should understand the [mal] of speech. This topic is explained in the 3rd and 4th Uddeshak.

For the purpose of [mal] disposal, generally, the monk is ordained to go to a secluded place outside the village, etc., where there is no coming and going. However, there is no ordinance anywhere for monks to go outside the village, etc., during the day or night for the purpose of excretion. Where they stay, there is a blameless [paristhapan] ground, they can dispose of urine, etc., in that very place.

If there is no [paristhapan] ground attached to the place where the monk stays, then according to the 10th A. 8 and Shraacha. Shru. 2 A. 2, that place is not fit for the monk to stay.

Even a common householder, if he has to stay somewhere for a few days, also wants to stay where there is a place to dispose of [mal] and urine nearby.

The monk, engaged in the practice of restraint, has the fifth [paristhapanika] samiti, therefore, he should definitely see a [paristhapan] worthy ground before staying.

In some copies of Nishith, the text "Juggsalans" is found after "Jaanagihans", but from the study of Churn, it is known that "Jugg" is a type of "Jaan" and after that, the word "Vahan" means a stable and house for horses, etc.

As - Juggadi Jaanaana Akudda Sala, Sakuddum Giham. Assadia Vahana, Taana Sala Giham Wa. - Churn ||

A place without walls for vehicles, etc., is called "Sala" and a place with walls is called "Griha". Horses, etc., are called vehicles, their "Sala" and "Griha" are called "Vahansala" and "Vahangriha". According to this explanation, the original text is accepted here.

In Sutra 67, the Ashram of the Parivrajaks is mentioned and in Sutra 74, the Parivrajaksala and Parivrajagrih are mentioned. The place where the Parivrajaks reside permanently is called Ashram. And the place built for resting on the way is called Sala or Griha, one should understand this. Perhaps, due to a scribal error, "Pariya" has become "Paniy" and the text has become longer, this topic is explained in the eighth Uddeshak.

##  Penance for giving food to a householder

76. Je Bhikkhu Annautthiyaassa Wa, Garathiyassa Wa Asanan Wa Paanan Wa Khaiman Wa Saiman Wa Dei, Detan Wa Saizjai.

76. The monk who gives food, drink, edible or palatable to another Tirthika or a householder, or approves of the giver, [he is given the Laghu Chaumasi penance].

Explanation - It is not permissible for a monk to give food to any householder or to a Samayik vow-taker Shravak sitting in the Upashraya, because his Savadya Yoga is not completely abandoned. 

Page #433:
---------------------------
## Fifteenth Uddeshak

[333] Even during Samayik, all necessary activities like business and farming remain under the ownership of the householder. Therefore, giving food to anyone other than the intended recipient incurs the prescribed atonement according to the Sutras.

The householder who gives food does so with devotion to support the monk's practice of restraint. Therefore, giving that food to someone else without the knowledge of the Jina and the householder's permission, violates the third Mahavrata.

If the householder who gave the food learns that the monk gave it to someone else, it leads to disrespect for the monks and diminishes the spirit of giving.

If, due to carelessness on the part of the giver or the monk, food, water, or any other unsuitable food is consumed knowingly, it should be returned to the same householder immediately. This is the rule mentioned in Praachan Shruti 2, Adhyaya 1, Uddehak 10 and Adhyaya 6, Uddehak 2.

**Atonement for giving and receiving food with a Parshvastha, etc.**

77. A monk who gives food, drink, edible things, or drinkable things to a Parshvastha, is guilty of a sin.
78. A monk who receives food, drink, edible things, or drinkable things from a Parshvastha, is guilty of a sin.
79. A monk who gives food, drink, edible things, or drinkable things to an Osanna, is guilty of a sin.
80. A monk who receives food, drink, edible things, or drinkable things from an Osanna, is guilty of a sin.
81. A monk who gives food, drink, edible things, or drinkable things to a Kusila, is guilty of a sin.
82. A monk who receives food, drink, edible things, or drinkable things from a Kusila, is guilty of a sin.
83. A monk who gives food, drink, edible things, or drinkable things to a Sansatta, is guilty of a sin.
84. A monk who receives food, drink, edible things, or drinkable things from a Sansatta, is guilty of a sin.
85. A monk who gives food, drink, edible things, or drinkable things to a Nitiya, is guilty of a sin.

**86. A monk who accepts, gives, or approves of the acceptance or giving of food, drink, or delicacies to a person who is *nityaka*. (He incurs the *laghucoumasi* penance.)**

**Discussion:**

Giving food to a householder implies approval of their worldly life. This is considered a transgression, as stated in the previous sūtra (76). Giving food to *pārśvastha* and other monks implies approval of their *eṣaṇā* (desire) tainted tendencies. Accepting food from *pārśvastha* and others involves consuming food tainted with *udgama* (origin) and other faults. Therefore, the penance for accepting or giving food to these individuals is described in these 10 sūtras.

The nature of *pārśvastha* and others has been explained in the discussion of the fourth *uddeśaka*.

The order of the five sūtras concerning *pārśvastha* and others is the same as in the fourth *uddeśaka*, but there is some inversion in the 13th *uddeśaka*, which may be due to a scribal error.

## Fifteenth Uddeshak:

**Penance for Accepting Clothes Without Investigation**

98. A monk who accepts or approves of accepting a requested or invited garment without knowing, asking, or investigating, is liable to penance.

This garment can be any of the four types:

1. **Nitya Niyamsajjie:** A garment used daily.
2. **Majjanie:** A garment worn for bathing.
3. **Chhannoosavie:** A garment worn for festivals.
4. **Rayaduvarie:** A garment worn for attending the royal court.

**(He is liable to the Laghu Chaumasik penance.)**

**Explanation:**

The sutra mentions two ways of obtaining garments:

1. **Yachana-Vastra:** A garment obtained by the monk requesting, "O householder, do you have any suitable garment for us?"
2. **Nimantana-Vastra:** A garment obtained when the householder, without being asked, invites the monk, "O Muni, if you need any garment, I have this one, please take it."

The sutra categorizes the garments based on their use by the householder. These four categories encompass all the householder's garments.

1. **Nitya:** This includes garments used daily for various purposes like lying down, wearing, or covering. The monk can accept those that are suitable and useful for him.

2. **Majjanie:** This can be included in the first category, as these garments are used for a short time and not worn all day. Alternatively, bathing is not a daily activity, so these garments are mentioned separately. The Churnikar has also included garments worn for visiting the temple in this category. These are also worn for a short time. Therefore, this category should be understood to include other garments used for a short duration.

3. **Mahothsav:** This category includes garments used for special occasions like festivals, celebrations, fairs, weddings, etc. 


Page #438:
---------------------------
## 338]
[Nishiy Sutra]
4. Rajasabha - The fourth category of clothes refers to those worn when going to the king's court or to the king's presence. 
If a monk wishes to accept any type of garment, he should inquire about the garment and ascertain that it is free from any origin-related defects, completely pure. Only after such inquiry should he accept it. Accepting it without inquiry can lead to various defects like establishment, acceptance, purchase, non-creation, etc. It can also lead to intentional or subsequent karma defects. Therefore, this Sutra states that if these four types of garments are obtained through begging or invitation, it is a sin not to inquire and investigate them. Therefore, the monk should carefully investigate the garment. The statement about the garment should be understood to include the need for investigation and atonement regarding other utensils, etc.

**Atonement for bodily care for adornment:**
99-152. A monk who, for the sake of adornment, washes his feet once or repeatedly, or approves of someone doing so, is subject to the atonement of the third Uddesaka (knowing the entire Alapaka from Sutra 16 to 69, or a monk who, while traveling from village to village for adornment, covers his head or approves of someone doing so, is subject to the atonement of the small Chaumasika).

**Discussion:** The discussion of these 54 Sutras should be understood to be similar to the third Uddesaka. The only difference is that here, performing these actions with the intention of adornment is considered a sin of the small Chaumasika.

**Atonement for wearing and washing utensils for adornment:**
153. A monk who, with the intention of adornment, holds a garment, a bowl, a blanket, a foot-cloth, or any other utensil, or approves of someone doing so, is subject to the atonement of the small Chaumasika.
154. A monk who, with the intention of adornment, washes a garment, a bowl, a blanket, a foot-cloth, or any other utensil, or approves of someone doing so, is subject to the atonement of the small Chaumasika.

If he serves such a person, he is subject to the atonement of the small Chaumasika, which includes the abandonment of the four-month retreat.

One who consumes the places mentioned in these 154 sutras incurs the minor Chau-masi pratyachitt.
Discussion - The monk keeps and uses the equipment like robes, bowls, etc. for the sake of observing restraint. In Dasavekalik Sutra, Pra. 6 Ga. 20, it is said:
"Jampi vattham va payam va, kambalam payapunchhanam. Tampi sanjam lajjatta, dharanti parihara ti ya."
In Prashnavyakaran Sutra, Shru. 2 Pra. 1 and 5, it is said:
"Eyam pi sanjamassa uvabuhhanattayae vayaatavadansamasaga siya parirakkhanattayae uvgaranam ragosarahiyam parihariyavam sanjaenam."
Meaning - The monk wears or uses robes, etc. for the sake of observing restraint, to avoid shame, to protect the body from heat, cold, wind, dust, mosquitoes, etc. The purpose of keeping these equipment is clear in the Agamas. But if the monk wears any equipment for the sake of adornment, for the beauty of the body, etc., i.e., to make himself look beautiful, or for no purpose, then according to the 153rd Sutra, he incurs pratyachitt.
The 154th Sutra states the pratyachitt for washing or decorating robes, etc. for the sake of adornment.
From these two sutras, it is also clear that if the monk keeps or washes robes, etc. for any purpose other than adornment, then the pratyachitt mentioned in the sutras does not apply. That is, the monk can keep the necessary equipment for restraint and wash them as needed, but there should be no intention of adornment in washing.
If it were completely unthinkable for the monk to wash robes, etc., then the pratyachitt for it would have been stated differently. But the sutra mentions the pratyachitt only for washing for the sake of adornment.
The 54 sutras related to bodily activities are often found in many Uddeshak, but here, in the chapter on adornment, 56 sutras are mentioned. Therefore, this sutra prescribes the washing of robes by the monk. In Gracha. Shru. 1.8 U. 4-5-6, there is a prohibition on washing robes for those who wear specific Abhigraha images. This is also clear from the description there.
This Uddeshak mentions the pratyachitt for bodily activities, keeping and washing equipment, with the intention of adornment. In other Agamas, adornment is prohibited for the monk in various ways:
1. In Dasha. Pra. 3 Ga. 9, adornment is called an unrighteous act.
2. In Dasha. A. 6 Ga. 65 to 67, it is said: "What is the purpose of adornment for a monk who accepts nakedness and shaved head, who does not perform the rituals of hair and nails, and who is abstaining from sexual intercourse? That is, there is no purpose for such a monk to adorn himself. Yet, if a monk adorns himself,

[Nishīthasūtra]
"He who engages in the activity of beautification binds himself with smooth karmas, causing him to fall into the deep and difficult ocean of the world."
"Knowledgeable ones consider even thoughts of beautification, like tendencies, to be the cause of karma-binding and the world. From this attitude of beautification, many wrong tendencies arise. This is not worthy of the conduct of a muni who protects the six bodies."
3. In Daśa. A. 8 Ga. 57, the attitude of beautification is compared to the poison of a snake.
4. In Uttarā. A. 16, it is said:
"A monk who engages in beautification
should not do so.
A monk should abandon beautification and body-care, and a celibate monk should not wear clothes or other adornments for the sake of beauty."
From these Āgama passages, it becomes clear that the attitude of beautification is completely harmful for celibacy, is a cause of karma-binding, and is worthy of atonement. Therefore, monks should abandon the thoughts of beautification, that is, they should not try to beautify their bodies or make their utensils look beautiful. They should wear utensils only for the sake of restraint and the protection of the body, and they should wash them only when necessary.

## Sixteenth Uddeshak: Penance for Staying in a Forbidden Bed

1. A monk who stays in a Sagarik bed, or approves of one who stays in such a bed, incurs a penance.
2. A monk who stays in a Saudaga bed, or approves of one who stays in such a bed, incurs a penance.
3. A monk who stays in a Saganij bed, or approves of one who stays in such a bed, incurs a penance. [He incurs the penance of Laghu-Chaumasik.]

**Explanation:**

"Sasagarik Sejjan = Jath Ithi Purisa Vasanti Sa Sagarika, Ithisagari Guruga Suttanivato." - Churni.

A place where a man and a woman reside, or where a single woman resides, or where only women reside, is called a "Sagarik bed". This Sutra states the penance for monks staying in such a bed.

The commentator has called a place adorned with ornaments, clothes, food, fragrant substances, musical instruments, dance, drama, songs, and sleep, seating, etc., as "Dravya-Sagarik bed", and a place with women as "Bhav-Sagarik bed".

Alternatively, a bed that evokes the possibility of sexual thoughts is called a "Sagarik bed".

Staying in a Dravya or Bhav Sagarik bed leads to spending time in contemplation or observation of those objects and their discussions, which hinders the observance of self-study, transcription, and Pratikraman, etc., of the restrained practitioner. It also leads to the remembrance of worldly tendencies, laxity in restraint, bondage of Mohkarma, and violation of restraint.

A disguised seeker may be tempted to indulge in Mohkarma at any time, leading to deviation from restraint or celibacy.

Acha. Shru. 2, A. 2 prohibits staying in a bed with women, children, animals, and food, etc., and also mentions the many faults of staying in such a Sagarik bed. 

Page #443:
---------------------------
## Sixteenth Uddeshak ]
[ 343
Therefore, the monk should abandon the bed of the ocean of matter and emotion and seek a pure bed. If even after searching, a faultless bed is not found, then he should remain in the refuge of the Gītartha and take the atonement mentioned in the sūtras.
Saudagam Sejjam   Where there is water in an open vessel or a pot, etc., the monk's actions of coming and going, etc., may cause harm to the microscopic beings.
From the arising of an intention, a monk may also have the intention to drink that water, or other people may have the fear that the monk will drink the water.
In the Brihatkalpasutra U 2, it is forbidden to stay where there are pots full of water throughout the day and night, and here, atonement is mentioned for staying in a place where water is generally present.
Sāgaṇiya Sejjam   In the Brihatkalpasutra, two options are mentioned for staying on a bed with fire: 1. Fire burning in a stove, furnace, etc., 2. The fire of a lit lamp. The monk should not stay in a house or a room of a house where there is fire burning or a lamp lit, because if he moves around there or performs the actions of bowing, writing, cleaning, etc., which are part of the conduct of a monk, there is a possibility of harming the fire element.
Using fire for warmth will incur the guilt of approving violence.
The commentaries have imagined many faults, which are mostly related to open fire or open lamps. In the present day, the electric lamps, etc., that are available do not have those faults, but the faults related to the use of light are still possible.
In the Brihatkalpasutra, it is forbidden to stay in a place where fire or lamps are burning day and night, but here, atonement is mentioned for staying on a bed with a generally lit fire. In the Āchārya Śruti 2, Pra. 2, U. 3, there is a prohibition on staying in a sāmaric bed, a bed with fire, and a bed with water, all at the same time.
In the Brihatkalpasutra Uddeshak 2, there is an exceptional provision for the monk to stay in a place with water or fire for one or two nights if no other place is available.
In the Niśīthabhāṣya Cūrṇa, it is also said that even if a Gītartha monk stays in such a place for one or two nights, he incurs atonement, but a Gītartha monk does not incur atonement. Because he can make a true decision about the exceptional situation.
In reality, to practice the Gītartha and to practice in the refuge of the Gītartha is the only conceivable practice. The wandering of one or many Gītarthas and the prohibition of all actions like begging, etc., is the same. Therefore, if other houses are not available, the monk can stay in the aforementioned beds for one or two nights, and if he stays longer, he should understand the atonement mentioned in the sūtras.
Many managers of monasteries install electrical fittings for convenience. They use and allow the use of lights when necessary. Saints also stay in the same monastery. There...

The main switch of the electricity in the Nishīth sūtra remains lit for 24 hours, but its light cannot be used for necessary tasks.
Nowadays, cell-powered clocks are installed in those shelters for time information.
There is no objection to the main switch and quartz clocks, therefore, no atonement arises from staying in such shelters.

## Sixteenth Uddeshak

**[345 10. A monk who eats or approves of the eating of the middle part of a sugarcane stalk, or of small pieces of sugarcane, with conscious awareness.**

**11. A monk who sucks or approves of the sucking of the middle part of a sugarcane stalk, or of pieces of sugarcane, with conscious awareness. (He incurs a Laghu-Chaumasi Pratikraman.)**

**Discussion:** In the previous Uddeshak, the statement about "village fruits" refers to the Pratikraman for eating all fruits with conscious awareness or with conscious awareness and attachment. However, "ikshu" (sugarcane) is not included in those fruits, because it is not a fruit but a "skandha" (stalk). Therefore, its Pratikraman is mentioned here in eight sutras.

The first four sutras deal with general sugarcane, and the second four sutras deal with its parts.

In Acharanga Sutra 2, Adhyaya 1, Uddeshak 10, sugarcane is described as having many abandoned dharmas, and its consumption is prohibited. In Praacharan Sutra 2, Adhyaya 7, Uddeshak 2, it is stated that if the sugarcane is without conscious awareness, then its consumption is permissible. Here, the Pratikraman for consuming sugarcane with conscious awareness is mentioned. Therefore, even if it is without conscious awareness, it is acceptable for a specific reason, otherwise, due to having many abandoned dharmas, it is unacceptable. If it is consumed for any reason, one should be mindful of discarding the inedible parts in a secluded place.

In the Bhashya-Churni, the word "Uchchume-rangam" is explained as "Uchchumo-yam," which is a synonym. There are also explanations for other words like "Kaaniyam, Angariyam, Vigadumiyam," etc. These words are found in Praacharan Sutra 2, Adhyaya 1, Uddeshak 8. These words are not found in the present sutras. Refer to Acharanga for the explanation of these words. There, they are also described as "Sachitt" (with conscious awareness) and "Ashastra-parinat" (transformed without weapons).

**Pratikraman for consuming food, etc., by those living in forests, etc.**

**12. A monk who takes food, drink, edibles, or delicacies from those living in the forest, those who have gone into the forest, those who are going on a journey through the forest, or those who are returning from a journey through the forest, or approves of those who take them. (He incurs a Laghu-Chaumasi Pratikraman.)**

**Discussion:** The sutra mentions the Pratikraman for consuming food, etc., in the forest, jungle, and wilderness. There, one may encounter four types of people:

1. **Aranyavaasi:** Those who live in the forest, eating roots, tubers, etc.
2. **Those who have gone into the forest:** To collect wood, fruits, etc.
3. **A group of people going on a long journey through the forest.**
4. **A group of people returning from a journey through the forest.** 

Page #446:
---------------------------
[346]
[Nishīthasūtra] If one were to take food from these people, there is a possibility of them committing violence against plants or animals, or suffering from hunger, etc., due to the lack of other means in the forest. Therefore, one should not take food from them. The sūtra uses three similar words, but their meanings are slightly different.
A forest that is very far from settlements like villages, towns, etc. is called "aranya". "Vana" refers to a forest that is near villages, towns, etc.
"Aṭavī" is a long forest that is full of dangers like thieves, etc., and takes many days to cross, with no settlements in between.
Even if one were to take food from people returning from "aṭavī", if there is a possibility of crossing the "aṭavī" in 1-2 days, they may still take longer due to thieves, etc., or getting lost. Therefore, one should completely avoid taking food from those who have traveled through "aṭavī".
The sūtra uses two words in relation to "aṭavī", both of which refer to a person who is staying in "aṭavī". However, if someone is preparing to go to "aṭavī" or has crossed "aṭavī" and reached a village, etc., then one should not consider taking food from them as a transgression.
In some copies, two sūtras are found in place of this one sūtra. The main reason for this is a scribal error.
## The Prāyaścitta for Saying "Vasurātnīka" and "Avasurātnīka"
13. A monk who calls a person with excellent character qualities as having poor character qualities, or approves of someone who says so.
14. A monk who calls a person with poor character qualities as having excellent character qualities, or approves of someone who says so. (He incurs the prāyaścitta of Laghu-Cāumāsī.)
## Discussion
After taking saṃyama, many practitioners remain engaged in pure worship for their entire lives. Many practitioners become less dedicated to saṃyama due to their declining physical abilities or changes in their ideology. Some even start to transgress the limits of saṃyama and do not purify themselves. Thus, there are different stages of practitioners.
Monks who practice saṃyama with pure worship are wealthy with the treasure of saṃyama. Therefore, they are referred to as "Vasurātnīka" in this sūtra. Those who transgress the limits of saṃyama and do not purify themselves are not wealthy with the treasure of saṃyama. Therefore, they are referred to as "Avasurātnīka" in the sūtra. 

Page #447:
---------------------------
## The Sixteenth Uddeshak

[347] A monk should not make false statements about these practitioners who engage in various types of practices, based solely on attachment, aversion, or ignorance, without having accurate knowledge. That is, a monk of pure conduct should not be called a monk of lax conduct, and a monk of lax conduct should not be called a monk of pure conduct.

Contradictory statements are made only out of attachment, aversion, or ignorance. Such actions are not appropriate for a monk. For this reason, atonement is mentioned in these sutras.

Not only should one not make false statements, but even truthful words that are unpleasant or harmful should not be spoken by a monk.

_The implication is that calling a pure-conduct practitioner a lax-conduct practitioner, and a lax-conduct practitioner a pure-conduct practitioner, is a contradictory statement, and therefore atonement is mentioned for it in these two sutras.

Calling a lax-conduct practitioner a lax-conduct practitioner is a harsh statement, and therefore atonement arises according to the second sutra of the fifteenth Uddeshak.

Therefore, a monk should not make false statements, and even if a truthful statement is unpleasant or harmful to someone, it should not be made.

This statement is made with respect to the qualities of restraint, and atonement for false statements regarding all other qualities, such as knowledge, should be understood from these sutras.

## Atonement for Gan-Samkramana (Transition of Group) for Saambhogik (Worldly) Conduct

15. The monk who transitions from a group of virtuous practitioners to a group of less virtuous practitioners, or approves of such a transition, (incurs a minor four-month atonement).

**Explanation:** A Gan-Nayak (leader of a group) is usually endowed with virtuous qualities, and the monks and nuns of that group are also generally endowed with similar virtuous qualities. Therefore, a group is also called pure-conduct or lax-conduct according to the Gan-Nayak.

If a monk does not find peace or satisfaction in his own group for some reason, and wishes to change groups, he may do so.

The Thananga Sutra mentions five reasons for changing groups in its fifth section.

The Brihatkalpa Sutra, chapter 4, lays down the procedure for joining another group: If a practitioner holding the rank of Acharya (teacher) or higher wishes to join another group, he should appoint another monk qualified for the position of Acharya in his place, with the consent of the group, and then leave with the permission of the group.

_Ordinary monks should also leave only with the permission of the Acharya or higher. No one can join another group without permission.

Page #448:
---------------------------
[348]
[Nishīthasūtra]
The Āgama states that the primary reason for a change of gana is to achieve inner peace and growth of spiritual qualities. If a change of gana leads to inner unrest or a decline in spiritual qualities, then even with the permission of the guru, it is not considered right according to the Jain scriptures. This is the understanding from these sūtras.
The meaning is that if someone wants to move from their current gana to a gana with less strict rules, then according to the sūtras, it is not considered right. However, if a monk, due to lack of patience or inability to maintain physical and mental composure, joins such a gana, then according to this sūtra, they incur the prāyaścitta of a small Caturmāsī.
In the 5th ṭhāna of the Ṭhānāṅga Sūtra, the reasons for changing ganas are mentioned. If a monk changes ganas for any of these reasons with the permission of the ācārya or other authorities, then they do not incur the prāyaścitta mentioned in the sūtras.
It is essential to carefully consider the future benefits and drawbacks before changing ganas, as someone who frequently changes ganas is called a pāpaśramaṇa in Uttarādhyayana 17. If they change ganas again within six months, then they are called a sabaladoṣa in Daśavaikālika 2. Therefore, one should not change ganas impulsively without careful consideration.
Prāyaścitta for dealing with a kadāgrahī
16. A monk who gives food, drink, medicine, or money to a kadāgrahī incurs prāyaścitta.
17. A monk who accepts food, drink, medicine, or money from a kadāgrahī incurs prāyaścitta.
18. A monk who gives clothes, a blanket, or a towel to a kadāgrahī incurs prāyaścitta.
19. A monk who accepts clothes, a blanket, or a towel from a kadāgrahī incurs prāyaścitta.
20. A monk who gives a dwelling to a kadāgrahī incurs prāyaścitta.
21. A monk who accepts a dwelling from a kadāgrahī incurs prāyaścitta.
22. A monk who enters the dwelling of a kadāgrahī incurs prāyaścitta.
23. A monk who gives a gift to a kadāgrahī incurs prāyaścitta.
24. A monk who accepts a gift from a kadāgrahī incurs prāyaścitta.

[349]

16. A monk who gives or approves of giving alms, food, drink, or delicacies to monks who are *kadagrahi* (those who have abandoned the path of right conduct)
17. A monk who takes or approves of taking alms, food, drink, or delicacies from monks who are *kadagrahi*
18. A monk who gives or approves of giving clothes, bowls, blankets, or foot-cloths to monks who are *kadagrahi*
19. A monk who takes or approves of taking clothes, bowls, blankets, or foot-cloths from monks who are *kadagrahi*
20. A monk who gives or approves of giving shelter to monks who are *kadagrahi*
21. A monk who takes or approves of taking shelter from monks who are *kadagrahi*
22. A monk who enters the shelter of monks who are *kadagrahi* or approves of such entry.
23. A monk who gives or approves of giving scriptures to monks who are *kadagrahi*
24. A monk who takes or approves of taking scriptures from monks who are *kadagrahi* (He incurs the *laghu-chaumasi* penance).

**Explanation:**

"**Buggaho kala ho, tam kaun avakkamati.**"
"**Ariho ti kalaho tti, bhandanam ti, vido tti egatt**" - Churni

The sutra uses the term "**Buggahavakkantam**" for monks who are *duragrahi* (those who hold onto wrong views) and who engage in conflict by speaking or acting contrary to the scriptures, or who abandon the *gachchha* (community) and wander freely. This section discusses the penance for associating with such monks, having contact with them, or engaging in any kind of exchange with them.

This is because, due to their oppositional nature, there is a possibility of using coercion or poison when giving or receiving food, water, clothes, etc. Perhaps, according to the "**kakatalia nyaya**" (the principle of coincidence), some incident might occur, leading to suspicion or accusations against each other.

Staying with a *kadagrahi* can lead to unnecessary disputes or an increase in *kashya* (negative emotions). Monks who are less knowledgeable or mature might be misled and abandon their *gana* (group) or their *samyama* (self-control). Alternatively, they might choose to stay with the *kadagrahi*.

Giving or receiving scriptures can also lead to the development or increase of various *samsargja dosha* (faults arising from contact). Therefore, one should avoid any contact with *kadagrahi* monks who are *utsutr pra-rupka* (those who are openly rebellious). 

Page #450:
---------------------------
[350]
[Nishīthasūtra]
Here, the atonement for bowing to or praising those who have taken the vow of begging for food is not mentioned, but it should be understood.
Although atonement is mentioned for various types of contact with those who have taken the vow of begging for food, or those who are close to them, it is never appropriate for a monk to behave rudely or impolitely towards them. Doing so is also a cause for atonement.
A monk who knows the cause of a particular type of benefit, or in exceptional circumstances, may give them food, etc. Then, by accepting the appropriate atonement for that act, he can also become pure.
There is no instruction in the commentary of the twenty-second atonement sūtra in the Upāśraya. Therefore, it appears that this sūtra has been added to the original text for some reason. Before that sūtra, there are two atonement sūtras about transactions in the Upāśraya. Having three sūtras means that one should not stay in an Upāśraya with them, nor should one go to their Upāśraya.
Atonement for traveling in forbidden areas
25. A monk who, even though he is in a region where food and other amenities are readily available, resolves to travel a long route that takes many days, or approves of someone who does so.
26. A monk who, even though he is in a region where food and other amenities are readily available, travels towards a region where non-Aryan, Mleccha, and border-dwelling thieves and robbers live, or approves of someone who does so. (He is subject to the atonement of Laghu-Chaumāsi).
Discussion - Āchā. Śru, 2 a. 3 u. 1 prohibits traveling in non-Aryan regions and on routes that take many days to traverse, and also explains the difficulties that arise from doing so. It also indicates that one should not travel towards such regions when there are regions suitable for practicing restraint.
Traveling in non-Aryan regions can lead to cruel harassment by the ignorant inhabitants, causing the monk to be unable to remain steadfast in his body and the meditation of restraint. In the event of a fatal harassment, there would also be self-destruction and destruction of restraint. Therefore, monks are not permitted to travel to such regions.
Even to travel to an Aryan region, if there is a long forest on a route that takes many days to cross, and there is no food, water, or housing along the way, then one should not travel in that direction. 

Page #451:
---------------------------
## Sixteenth Uddeshak

[351] This is necessary because if there is sudden rainfall on the way, water fills up everywhere, there is vegetation or mud, etc., then due to the lack of food and other necessities, a critical situation arises for the restraint and life of the monk. If there is a lot of water in the rivers, it is also not possible to find a boat, etc. The Acharanga Sutra prohibits such travel by stating these faults. The same is mentioned here in these two sutras as a penance.

If one has to cross a difficult forest path to reach an Aryan area due to famine or the hateful behavior of a king or others, and there is no other suitable area for maintaining restraint, then the penance mentioned in the sutras does not apply. Both the Acharanga and Nishita Sutras allow for this exception, and the Acharanga Sutra also explains what discretion should be exercised in such a situation.

In addition, it is also prohibited to travel in the direction where there is an army camp or where there is conflict between two kings. Therefore, a monk should not travel as far as possible on paths or in areas that cause distraction to the body and restraint.

The penance for begging, etc., in despicable families:

27. The monk who accepts food, drink, edibles, or delicacies from despicable families, or approves of those who accept them.
28. The monk who accepts clothes, bowls, blankets, or foot-cloths from despicable families, or approves of those who accept them.
29. The monk who accepts a bed from despicable families, or approves of those who accept them.
30. The monk who performs self-study (reciting the original text) in despicable families, or approves of those who do so.
31. The monk who recites the scriptures in despicable families, or approves of those who do so.
32. The monk who accepts offerings in despicable families, or approves of those who do so. 

Page #452:

[352]
[Nishīthasūtra 31. A monk who gives or approves of giving the recitation (sūtrārtha) of svādhyāya in despicable families.
32. A monk who takes or approves of taking the recitation of svādhyāya in despicable families. (He incurs the prāyaścitta of laghu-cāumāsī.)
Discussion-Pāca. Śru. 2 a. 1 u. 2 states that it is permissible to go for alms in the 12 families that are not to be despised and not to be avoided, and in other similar families.
These sūtras only mention the prāyaścitta for taking alms from despicable families. Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya, and Vaiśya are the three families that are not to be despised, and Śūdra is a despicable family. Mlecchas and other non-Aryan families are also considered to be forbidden for alms, etc.
Pāca. Śru. 2 a. 1 u. 2 states that it is permissible to go to the villages of cowherds, farmers, carpenters, weavers, artisans, barbers, and other such families.
Uttara. a. 12 and 13 mention that people from the 'Harijan' family take saṃyama and go to mokṣa by performing pūjā. Therefore, one should not understand that people from despicable families are forbidden from performing dharma-pūjā. If a monk happens to touch a Harijan, he does not incur any prāyaścitta. However, since the families from which monks take alms are mostly those who perform śauca-karma, he should not go to despicable families for alms, because he has to enter the houses of those who perform śauca-karma to avoid the faults of eṣaṇā. Monks who enter despicable families for alms may be refused entry into the houses of other śauca-karma-performing (those who perform śauca-karma as their main dharma) people. Therefore, one should understand that this prohibition and prāyaścitta mentioned in the sūtras is only due to social behavior.
Uttara. a. 25 states that Kṣatriya, Vaiśya, and Brāhmaṇa are born from karma, and Śūdra is also born from karma.
Āca. Śru. 1 a. 2 u. 3 states that this being is born sometimes in a high family and sometimes in a low family, therefore, there is no one who is low and no one who is high.
A monk always behaves with equality towards everyone, yet it is also necessary to follow the rules mentioned in the sūtras, such as not entering these families due to social norms.
In the Bhāṣya Cūrṇi, families who perform sūtaka and the rituals of the deceased are also considered to be despicable families for a short period of time.
Although there is only prāyaścitta for merely staying in a despicable family, if one has to stay there for some reason, one should not perform svādhyāya or recite it there. Prāyaścitta for placing a foot on the earth, a bed, and a sneeze
33. A monk who throws or approves of throwing food, drink, or a morsel on the earth.

[353]

34. A monk who places food, drink, or edibles on the ground, or approves of someone doing so, incurs a minor atonement.

35. A monk who places food, drink, or edibles on a seat, or approves of someone doing so, incurs a minor atonement.

36. A monk who places food, drink, or edibles on a peg, a hook, or a similar object, or approves of someone doing so, incurs a minor atonement.

**Explanation:**

Monks are the holders of the begging bowl. Therefore, it is permissible to place food, drink, or edibles in their hands, in their bowls, or on the cloth used to hold the bowl. However, it is not permissible to place food, drink, or edibles on the ground or on a seat while they are being held in the hand or the bowl.

There are many types of humans and other living beings, such as ants, who roam the earth. They often discard impure substances, and the ground is covered with various types of impure particles, dust, and other impurities. There are also many types of insects that roam the earth. Placing food on the ground is also considered inappropriate in social conduct. Therefore, the sutra states that this act incurs an atonement.

A seat or a mat made of grass is used for many days. If food is placed on it, the food particles may stick to it, attracting insects. The seat may also be soiled with dirt, sweat, etc. Therefore, placing food on a seat, and for the same reasons, on clothing, or on objects used for cleaning, should also be considered prohibited.

Placing food on a peg, a hook, etc., may lead to the bowl breaking if it falls. Rats and other animals may also reach there and bite or drop the food.

For these reasons, it is prohibited to place food on the ground, on a seat, or on a peg, etc. Doing so incurs a minor atonement.

According to the second Uddeshak of Nishītha, it is permissible to tie food in a cloth and hang it on a peg, etc., if it is necessary due to local circumstances.

Many food items are dry and free from impurities. Placing them on the ground, etc., may not cause the above-mentioned problems. However, due to carelessness, the tradition of committing this offense may increase. Therefore, the sutra states the atonement for placing all types of food, drink, etc., on the ground, etc., in general.

If, by mistake, some food falls on the ground and becomes impure due to dust, etc., then... 

Page #454:
---------------------------
[354]
[Nishīthasūtra]
If there are no material objects, then the monk can use them after carefully examining them. There is no prāyaścitta (atonement) mentioned in the sūtra for doing so.
It is an inappropriate tendency to place food on the ground voluntarily. The sūtra mentions the prāyaścitta for such a tendency. The prāyaścitta for eating in front of householders is as follows:
36. The monk who eats with other non-Jain ascetics or householders, or approves of those who eat.
37. The monk who eats surrounded by other non-Jain ascetics or householders, or approves of those who eat. (He receives the laghu-cāumāsī prāyaścitta.)
36. The monk who eats with other non-Jain ascetics or householders [sitting nearby], or approves of those who eat.
37. The monk who eats surrounded by other non-Jain ascetics or householders [sitting or standing some distance away], or approves of those who eat. (He receives the laghu-cāumāsī prāyaścitta.)
Discussion: In the fifteenth uddeśaka, the prāyaścitta for giving food etc. to a householder is mentioned. Now, here, it is appropriate to understand the meaning of the word "saddi" as eating while sitting nearby. Because, if they eat together, i.e., from the same vessel, then there is a possibility of many faults. If the food is brought by the householder, then it may be contaminated with prādhākarma etc. faults. If the food is brought by the monk, then the fault of adatta (not giving) is incurred, and these faults are worthy of the guru-cāumāsī prāyaścitta, whereas the present sūtra mentions the laghu-cāumāsī prāyaścitta. Therefore, from the first sūtra, one should understand the prāyaścitta for eating together with a householder and a monk sitting nearby.
If the householder is not eating, but is standing or sitting in a distant direction or all around, then if the monk eats in front of them, then the prāyaścitta for that is mentioned in the second sūtra.
When eating near a householder, there is a possibility of the householder inviting, giving, etc., and those who see may have doubts. Sometimes, a householder may forcibly put food into the vessel or snatch it away.
Among the householders who are sitting or standing in front, there may be some who are curious or hateful. They may insult the food or the monk eating in many ways.
The method of eating for a monk is also different from that of a householder. For example, eating after wiping and cleaning the vessel, or drinking after washing it, etc. Therefore, one should eat in a secluded place with walls and a roof on all sides.
Even while eating, if a householder happens to come there and sit down, then the monk should also go elsewhere in the "ekāsana" tapa. 

Page #455:
---------------------------
## Sixteenth Uddeshak

[355] If a monk does not find a place to eat away from a householder, he can eat by putting up a curtain of cloth on one side or all sides. If the monk is eating alone, he can eat with his back towards the householder, being mindful. The meaning is that the monk should eat in such a place where the householder cannot see him. Monks should use food and other things only in such places.

**Penance for disrespecting the Acharya and Upadhyaya**

38. If a monk, while walking, touches the bedding of the Acharya or Upadhyaya with his foot, and does not apologize with his hand, nor confesses his mistake, or approves of someone else doing so, he incurs a minor four-month penance.

**Explanation:**

It is unwise to touch anything with one's foot. The Acharya and Upadhyaya are the most respected in the entire Gachchha. Therefore, every monk should show them respect and honor. Touching their bedding with the foot is also a sign of disrespect and unwise behavior. Touching their body, food, clothes, etc., with the foot is also disrespectful. Therefore, a monk should be very mindful while walking near the Acharya, Upadhyaya, or their belongings.

The Churni says:

"If one does not apologize with his hand after touching with his foot, and does not confess his mistake, he incurs a minor four-month penance."

If a monk's foot touches the bedding of the Acharya or Upadhyaya, he should apologize to them respectfully. If they are not present, he should touch the bedding with his hand to make amends for the disrespect shown by his foot, and say "Micchami Dukkadam" to acknowledge his mistake. If any dust or dirt has been transferred from the foot, he should clean it.

If a monk's foot touches the belongings or body of another monk, he should show the same mindfulness.

If a monk, in such situations, does not show any respect or mindfulness and continues walking as if nothing happened, he incurs the penance mentioned in the sutra.

This is because such behavior shows disrespect towards the Acharya and Upadhyaya, perpetuates unwise behavior, makes others feel disrespected, disrespects the Gachchha, and encourages other monks to follow suit, leading to an increase in disrespect within the Gachchha.

Although food and other things are not worthy of worship, touching them with the foot is disrespectful. Therefore, the sutra emphasizes that one should show respect by touching the bedding with the hand to make amends for the disrespect shown by the foot.

## 356]
[Penance for possessing more than the prescribed number or measure of possessions]
39. A monk who possesses or approves of possessing more than the prescribed number or measure of possessions.
36. A monk who possesses or approves of possessing more than the prescribed number or measure of possessions. (He incurs the penance of Laghu-Chaumasika.)

**Discussion:** The complete list of possessions for a monk is found in the Brihatkalpasutra, U. 3, and the Prashnavyakaranasutra, Shru. 2, A. 5.

According to the Brihatkalpasutra, a monk should be ordained after receiving Rajoharan, Gochchag, Patra, and three Akhand Vastra.

Here, the number of Rajoharan, Gochchag [Poojani], and Patra is not mentioned. The remaining equipment includes a sheet, Cholapattka, Mukhavastrika, Asana, Jholi, Patra's cloth, Rajoharan's cloth, for which a total of three Akhand Vastra are mentioned, but their individual number or size is not mentioned.

The Brihatkalpasutra prohibits possessing more than three Akhand Vastra (complete cloth). Therefore, the three Thans mentioned here should be understood as indicators of the measure of the complete possessions. Traditionally, this measure is considered to be 72 hands of cloth. However, this measure is not explicitly mentioned in the original Agamas or commentaries.

The Prashnavyakaranasutra states, "These are the possessions of a well-established Shraman who holds a Patra: Patra, Patrabandhan, Patrakesarika, cloth for holding Patra (three Patals), Rajastraan, Gochchag, three sheets, Rajoharan, Cholapattka, Mukhavastrika, etc. He also wears these for restraint and physical protection."

Here, while mentioning Rajoharan and Gochchag, it mentions six equipment related to Patra instead of Patra, and instead of three Akhand Vastra, it mentions sheets, Cholapattka, Mukhavastrika, etc. It mentions three each for Patals and sheets, but does not specify the number of Patra, Cholapattka, Mukhavastrika, and all the equipment. The word "etc." is used at the end of the text, which suggests that other possessions can also be accepted, such as Prasana, etc.

Apart from these two sources, the Acharangasutra also has an independent study on cloth and Patra, and the Chhedasutras also describe the rules and prohibitions regarding cloth, Patra, Rajoharan, etc. in many sutras.

The present Prashchittasutra mentions penance for possessing more than the prescribed number and measure of possessions, but the above-mentioned Agamas do not explicitly mention the measure and number of possessions. Only the number of sheets, Patra's Patals, and Akhand Vastra is mentioned. Even though the commentary provides a detailed description of possessions, it does not mention the measure and number of many essential equipment, and many mentions are unclear, such as keeping one Patra or keeping a Cholapattka of two hands for a young Sadhu. Keeping one unit but not using it, etc. Due to these reasons, the traditions regarding the quantity and measure of possessions have become different. 

Page #457:
---------------------------
## Sixteenth Discourse

[357] The mention of keeping three sheets is clear in the Agamas, and in the commentary of this sutra, it is stated that a Jain monk who has a begging bowl or is a holder of a bowl should keep one, two, or three sheets.

In Acharanga Sutra 1, Chapter 8, Verses 4-5-6, there is a description of a monk who is a holder of possessions regarding clothing. There too, there is a description of a monk who wears three garments [sheets], two garments, one garment, and a monk who wears only a loincloth and a shawl.

In the description of the "Uṇodari" (wearing a single garment) of clothing, it is stated in the original text to keep one garment [sheet]. In the commentary, it is also said that keeping two sheets is also considered "Uṇodari" of clothing. Therefore, the number of sheets is clear in the Agamas and their commentaries.

In Acharanga Sutra 2, Chapter 5, Verse 1, after mentioning six types of garments, it is stated that "A monk who is young and healthy should wear one garment, i.e., only one type of garment, not another." It is not appropriate to interpret this statement as referring to the number of sheets, because here only the type of garment is prescribed, and in the previous Agamas, there is a clear mention of keeping three sheets for both Jain monks and those who hold possessions. The description of "Uṇodari" of clothing also proves that keeping multiple sheets is permissible. Therefore, it is in accordance with the Agamas to interpret the text of Acharanga Sutra as meaning that a capable monk should wear only one type of garment, and it should be understood that performing "Uṇodari" tapasya by keeping less than three sheets, i.e., two or one sheet, is optional.

In the commentary verse 5807, it is stated that Jain monks, those who hold possessions, etc., can keep three, two, or one sheet, but a "Sthavirakalpi" (senior monk) should keep three sheets as a rule.

In the commentary verse 5794, the medium size of a sheet is stated as 33423 hands, and the excellent size as 4423 hands. This means that a young monk should keep a sheet that is three and a half hands long, and an elderly monk should keep a sheet that is four hands long.

In the study of "Vastraishana" (clothing) in Acharanga Sutra, the width of a nun's sheets is stated as four hands, three hands, and two hands. There is no mention of the length. However, the length is always greater than the width, so the tradition of keeping a sheet that is five hands long is appropriate.

In Uttara Adhyayana 26, in the section on "Pratilekhana" (copying), the statement "Chha Purima Nav Khodha" also suggests that the excellent length of a sheet should be five hands.

The three sizes of four sheets mentioned for nuns are not all of the same length and width. Similarly, the three sheets of a monk are not all the same. Since the Agamas do not mention their measurements, they can be made smaller or larger according to their usefulness and need.

The commentary mentions only one type of width for a sheet, i.e., two and a half hands. It is not appropriate to consider this as applicable to all three sheets according to the Agamas. Therefore, the length and width of all three sheets of a monk can vary. Currently, a sheet that is five hands long and three hands wide is commonly used.

## Translation:

[358]
The *Cholpattak* is only mentioned by name in the *Nishith Sutra* and the *Cholpattak-Prashnavyakaran Sutra* in the context of a monk's attire. There is no further description of it in other Agamas.

The *Nishith Bhashya* (verse 5804) mentions a *Cholpattak* measurement of two hands long and one hand wide for a young monk. This is not sufficient to cover the body in a way that would be considered modest in worldly terms. Therefore, its purpose is not clear.

This verse does not mention the number of *Cholpattak*s.

For an older monk, the same verse mentions a *Cholpattak* measurement of four hands long and one hand wide. This may not be sufficient to cover the body in a way that would be considered modest for them either.

Due to the lack of a clear, ancient, and pure tradition, there are many different sizes of *Cholpattak*s in use today, with varying lengths and widths. These variations contradict the evidence provided by the *Bhashya*.

The *Brihatkalpa Sutra* states that a monk should receive three whole pieces of cloth (*than*) at the time of initiation, which are sufficient for all the necessary equipment. If the *Cholpattak* and other garments are made according to the measurements mentioned in the *Bhashya*, then there would be no need for the three *than* of cloth mentioned in the *Brihatkalpa Sutra*. Therefore, the true size of the *Cholpattak* is that it should be large enough to provide modesty, protect from the cold, and fit the body in terms of length and width.

Although the Agamas and *Bhashya* do not mention the number of *Cholpattak*s, it is appropriate for a *sthavirakalpi* to have two *Cholpattak*s, considering the need for copying scriptures and other activities.

*Mukhavastrika* - " *Mukhapotika* - *mukham pidhanaya*, *potam* - *vastran mukham potam*, *tadeva hrasvam chaturangulaadhikavitastimaatra pramanatvat mukhapotika*. *Mukhavastrikaayam*." - *Pindaniyukti*.

Meaning: *Mukhavastrika* is the cloth used to cover the face. It is one *bent* and four *angula* (16 *angula*) long.

The *Nishith Bhashya* and *Brihatkalpa Bhashya* mention this measurement, but they do not specify the length and width. Other Agamas and commentaries also do not mention the length and width separately. Therefore, it is clear that the *mukhavastrika* should be 16 *angula* square.

In the *murtipujak* community, it is common to use a square *muhpatti*. In the *Sthanakvasi* community, it is common to use a *mukhavastrika* that is 21 *angula* long and 16 *angula* wide. This measurement is not found in any Agama or commentary, but it is more suitable for covering the face.

The *Odhaniyukti* mentions the *mukhavastrika* as follows:

" *Chatvaryangulaani vitastishcheti, etacchaturastra mukhanantakasya pramanam, athava idam dvitiya pramanam - yadut mukhapramnam karttavya muhanantam; etaduktan bhavathi vasatipramarjanadou yatha mukham pacchaadyate tryanan konadvaaye grihitva krikaatika prishthatasch yatha granthitum shakyate tatha karttavya etaddvitiyam pramanam, ganana pramanena punastadekakameva mukhanantakam bhavathi iti*. - *Odhaniyukti* verse 711 commentary.

Meaning: The *mukhavastrika* is 16 *angula* long and wide, making it square. There is another type of *mukhavastrika* that is triangular and used to cover the face and nose when cleaning the house. It is tied at the back of the head in such a way that it can be tied securely. This is the second measurement. However, according to the calculation, there is only one type of *mukhanantak* (face covering). 

Page #459:
---------------------------
## Sixteenth Uddeshak

[359]

It is tied by giving a knot behind the neck after covering it, and it is also square. Its proof is as much as one should understand from the aforementioned method. It is necessary to keep one each of both types of mukhavastrikas for every Shraman and Shramani.

The commentary on the 694th gatha of the Aodhaniyukti also mentions that the mukhavastrikas are square and sixteen angulas in size. For this reason, the commentary texts of the Chhedasutras do not mention the length and width of the mukhavastrikas separately, but only the measurement of sixteen angulas. Due to lack of knowledge of this statement of Aodhaniyukti, or not considering it as suitable evidence, modern Acharyas have imagined a length of twenty-one angulas and a width of sixteen angulas. But the original evidence is only of a square mukhavastrikas of sixteen angulas.

The purpose of both types of mukhavastrikas is explained in gatha 712. Its commentary is as follows:

"Sampatim satvarakshanarth jalpadbhimukhe diyate," "Tatha nasikamukham badhnati taya mukhavastrikaya vasati pramardayan, yena na mukhadau raja pravishati iti."

The mukhavastrikas are kept on the mouth while speaking to protect the Sampatim beings, and while cleaning the upashraya, the mukhavastrikas are tied to prevent fine dust from entering the mouth and nose. In the commentary of Uttara. A. 3, the reason for keeping the mukhavastrikas is explained as follows:

Santi sampatimaḥ satvāḥ, sūkshmaśca vyāpino 'pare. Teṣām rakṣānimittaṁ ca, vijñeyā mukhavastrikāḥ.

-Abhi. Rajendra Kosh Bha. 6, page 333 Meaning - It should be understood that the 'mukhavastrikas' are kept for the protection of Sampatim beings and other subtle beings that spread everywhere.

In Bhagavati Sutra Sh. 16, U. 2, the language spoken with an open mouth is called Savad. A Muni is a renunciant of Savad language.

Even the Jinkalpi, etc., who are mendicants without clothes and without power, are required to keep mukhavastrikas. Because mukhavastrikas and rajoharan are essential tools of the Muni symbol.

For proof, see: 1. Brihatkalp U. 3, commentary on gatha 3963 2. Nishita U. 2, commentary on gatha 1391 3. Abhidhan Rajendra Kosh Part 4 'Jinkapp' page 1489,

-Pracha. Shru. 1 A. 2 commentary 4. Abhidhan Rajendra Kosh Part 6 'Lingkapp' page 656.

-Panchakalp: Bhashya and Churni, Kalp 2

---------------------------
## Nishīthসূত্র

Based on these proofs, it is clear that tying the mukhapatti on the mouth is suitable for the muni-chinha and for the protection of life. Otherwise, it is certain that almost all sadhus and sadhvis will speak with their mouths open, and if it is left aside, the muni-chinha will also not remain. While walking in villages and so on, or in viharas and so on, if the mukhastrika is not on the mouth, then it becomes meaningless to call it an essential tool in the bhaṣyādi for the sake of the jinkalpi, etc., in comparison to the muni-chinha.
[360]

In Bhagavati Sutra, Chapter 9, Verse 32, there is mention of the mukhapatti with eight folds. In the Samutthāna Sutra, there is also mention of eight folds.

In the Śvetāmbara Murtipujaka community, a mukhapatti with four folds is kept, but a prāṭha pat is also made on one side. It is always kept in the hand. During viharas and so on, it is also hung in the cholapattka. Śvetāmbara Sthānakavāsī munis completely tie the mukhavastrikā on their face with eight folds. In the Śivapurāṇa, Chapter 21, while introducing the Jain sadhu, it is said that they wear a mukhavastrikā on their face. As follows:

> With a vessel in hand, and holding a cloth in their turban, they wear dirty clothes and speak little.

In the Nishīthabhāṣya and Piṇḍaniyukti, it is said:

> The second thing to be observed is the mukhapatti. [5805]

- Rājendra Koṣa, Vol. 6, p. 333. This statement about making the mouth a prāmāṇa by tying the mukhavastrikā on the face can only be meaningful. The number of mukhavastrikās is not mentioned in the Āgama. Therefore, two or more can be kept as needed. In the vyākhyā granthas, it is said to keep one mukhavastrikā each.

## Kambaḷ

The name kambaḷ appears in many places in the Āgamas. It is kept for the protection of the body from cold.

In the Praśnavyākaraṇasūtra, where there is mention of three chadḍars, the name kambaḷ is not mentioned in the other upadhi, therefore it is included in the three chadḍars. A bhikṣu who can tolerate cold can manage with one cotton chadḍar and can also remain without an achela, while performing the Ūṇodari tapa of clothing.

Or, a bhikṣu performing the Ūṇodari tapa, depending on the type of cloth, can give up the kambaḷ by keeping only cotton cloth.

The kambaḷ has come to be considered a means of protecting life, which is merely a tradition, but not Āgama-sanmata. In Daśa Daśa, Chapter 7, there is a description of the padimadhārī bhikṣu going on vihar from sunrise to sunset. It is said that wherever the sunset occurs, they should spend the night there without negligence.

In the Bṛhatkalpa, Chapter 2, it is said that it is desirable for a sadhu to stay in a place with an open sky, and it is desirable for a sādhvī to stay there. But it is not said there that there should be a violation of the apkāya or that they should stay wearing a kambaḷ.

## Sixteenth Uddeshak

[361] Therefore, considering a blanket as an essential tool for life protection, similar to a face cloth or a dust remover, is not in accordance with the Agamas.

A monk who sits on an _asana_ can keep a cotton or woolen _asana_ in addition to a _chaddar_, _cholpattak_, and _kambla_, as per his need and desire. A monk who practices _unodari_ tapasya (austerity) can discard woolen clothes and keep a cotton _asana_. A monk who practices further austerity can even discard the _asana_. He can use the same cloth he wears for sleeping and sitting. A monk who becomes an _achel_ (one who wears only a loincloth) can manage with only a _shayya-sanstark_ (bedding) without an _asana_.

Commentary texts mention two _asanas_: one cotton and one woolen. They call the cotton one _uttar-patta_ and the woolen one _sanstark-patta_.

**Clothes related to _patra_ (bowl):**

1. _Jholi_ (bag) for bringing alms
2. Cloth for keeping bowls containing food
3. Cloth to be placed between empty bowls when tied together
4. Cloth for filtering or covering water
5. Soft cloth for cleaning bowls

These are called, respectively, 1. _patrabandhan_, 2. _patra sthapanak_, 3. _patla_, 4. _rajastraan_, 5. _patrakesarika_ in _Prashna Shruti_ 2, _Adhyaya_ 5. These clothes can be kept long or wide as per need, as the Agamas do not mention any specific measurements.

**_Padapronchhan_ (foot-cloth):**

This is also a cloth-based tool. It is mentioned in many places in the Agamas, including the _Nishith Sutra_. Its main use is to wipe feet.

The _Acharaanga Sutra_ mentions its use during defecation. According to _Brihatkalpa_ 5 and _Nishith_ 2, it is sometimes used to clean the bed by tying it to a wooden stick. According to _Nishith_ 5, a householder's _padapronchhan_ can be brought for a day or two if needed. Thus, the Agamas describe various types and uses of _padapronchhan_. Due to these diverse uses or other perspectives, commentary texts consider it synonymous with _rajohan_ (dust remover). Sometimes, it is divided into two parts: 'patra' and 'pronchhan' (dust remover). This misunderstanding might have led to the use of 'padapronchhan' in place of 'rajohan' in the original text.

The _Prashna Vyakaran Sutra_ clarifies that _padapronchhan_ is a different tool from _rajohan_. It mentions both tools separately, and the commentator also counts them separately, making the total number of tools 12.

_Dasha_ 4 also mentions both tools together.

It is made from old or used cloth pieces, which can be cotton or woolen. There is no specific measurement for it. Commentary texts describe it as a square woolen cloth piece of one hand span. However, those who practice _unodari_ use only cotton cloth for all purposes, discarding woolen clothes. Therefore, it cannot be insisted that any tool must be woolen. For further information on _padapronchhan_, refer to _Uddeshak_ 2, _Sutra_ 1-8. 

Page #462:

##  [362]
[Nishith Sutra]

Nishithya - This is a cloth used to wrap around the stick used for menstruation. There is no mention of it in the Agamas. Therefore, it is used traditionally to wrap around the stick used for menstruation. This helps keep the menstruation cloth tied securely and prevents animals from being scared by the wooden stick with the cloth. There is also a tendency to keep Nishithya with embroidery and colors, and to wrap two or three Nishithya together, which is purely a tradition. This has no significance in terms of restraint and such colorful, embroidered tools are unimaginable for a Sadhu.

All these are considered clothing related tools. The Agamas do not clearly describe the measurements of all these. Therefore, a monk can keep useful clothes according to his needs and the Gan Samachari, without attachment. However, if the total measurement of all these clothes exceeds three unbroken cloths (than-taka), they will incur the prescribed atonement. According to Nishi. U. 18, there is no atonement for keeping extra clothes beyond the limit with permission due to inability (ashakti praadi).

For Sadhvi - The Pagams mention 4 chadars and their width. 'Uggahanantk' and 'Ugghapattak' are two special tools mentioned. The Agamas do not have a clear separate measurement for the tools of Sadhvi. Therefore, Sadhvis can also keep tools according to their needs and Samachari, but they should understand that keeping more than four unbroken cloths without reason and permission will also incur the prescribed atonement.

Due to the protection of virtue and the structure of the body, some tools may have a higher number and measurement, for which one unbroken cloth is mentioned in the Brihatkalpasutra.

Uggahanantk - Ugghapattak - The long (like a loincloth) cloth used to cover the genitals is called 'Ugghapattak'. The underwear-like tool can be called Uggahanantk.

Brihatkalpa Sutra U. 3 prohibits these two tools for Sadhus and prescribes them for Sadhvis. These two tools are kept for the protection of virtue and are worn as needed. The commentators have described six tools in place of these two tools and have mentioned a total of 25 tools for Sadhvi and 14 tools for Sadhu. There is no such instruction in the Agamas. Different tools are mentioned in different places. The Prashnavyakaran Sutra mentions the tools together, but there is no mention of the number, nor does that statement determine the number mentioned in the commentaries.

Patra - Wooden, Tumba, Earthen, any of these three types of Patras can be kept, this is clearly mentioned in many Agamas, but the number of Patras is not determined by any Agama text.

1. Aacha. Shru. 1, A. 8, U. 4 mentions many Patras for a specific vow-taker, capable monk:
'Je Bhikkhu Tihi Vatthehi Parivasie, Pay Chautthehi.' 

Page #463:
---------------------------
## Sixteenth Discourse]
[363
Here, instead of using the singular form, the plural word 'pay chautthehin' has been used.
2. In Vyav. Up. 2, while laying down the rules for a monk who is performing Pariharatapaschitta, five words have been used in relation to the vessel:
'Sayansi wa Padiggahanssi, Sayansi wa Palasaganssi, Sayansi wa Kamandalanssi, Sayansi wa Khubbaganssi, Sayansi wa Panissi.'
Here, the word 'Padiggahanssi' is for the vessel of food. The word 'Palasaganssi' is for the measure, and the word 'Kamandalanssi' is for the water vessel. This text also clearly states that there are many types of vessels.
_3. In Bhagavati Sutra Sh. 2, Up. 5, there is a description of Gautam Swami's many vessels while going on a pilgrimage:
Tae nan se Bhagavan Goyame Chatthakkhamanparanganssi Jav Bhayanai Vatthai Padilhehi Bhayanai Vatthai Padilhehita Bhayanai Pamjjahi, Bhayanai Pamjjitta Bhayanai Uggahehi, Bhayanai Uggahettta Jenev Samane Bhagavan Mahavire Jav Bhikkhayeriyan Adahi Jav Esanan Anesanan Aloaehi Aloaetta Bhattapanam Padidamsehi.
This description states that Gautam Swami transcribed and cleaned many vessels and showed both the food and water brought on the pilgrimage to the Lord. Here, there is a clear description of Gautam Swami having many vessels.
4. In Bhagavati Sutra Sh. 25, Up. 7, the description of Uparana-Unodari is as follows: 'Se ki tan Uvagaranomoyariya? Uvagaranomoyariya Ege Vatthe, Ege Pae, Chiyattovagaran Saizjanaya.'
Here, it is stated that having one cloth (sheet) and one vessel constitutes Unodari tapas. This clearly proves that having many clothes and many vessels is possible, because only if there are many clothes and vessels to choose from can having one cloth or vessel constitute Unodari tapas.
5. In Prashnavyakaran Sutra Shru. 2, A. 5, the number of 'Patals' in the equipment of the vessel is said to be three. The Patals are used to tie the vessels together. Due to being placed in the middle of the vessels, they are called 'Patals' (Astan). Their number is said to be three, therefore, it is self-evident that there are more than three vessels. Three Patals are not needed for one or two vessels. The commentators have explained that the Patals are used to cover the food vessels while traveling on a pilgrimage, and they have also said that five to seven Patals should be kept. But in the Agam, separate equipment like Jholi and Rajastran are mentioned for covering the food vessels, therefore, the above-mentioned use of Patals is appropriate.
6. In Pracha. Shru. 2, A. 6, the text related to the vessel is as follows: 

Page #464:
---------------------------
[364]
"If a monk or a nun wishes to investigate a vessel, they should know that it is a vessel made of gourd, wood, or clay. Of these, the vessel that is sturdy and well-made, suitable for a young Nigrantha, should be taken, not another."

The meaning is that this rule regarding the acceptance of one type of vessel out of three is in relation to the type of vessel, not the number. If it is understood without considering the context that only one vessel is permissible for a monk, not many, then this meaning contradicts many other scriptures. Because it is clear from the scriptures mentioned above that a Ganadhara, a monk who practices Pariharic tapas, and a monk who has taken a specific vow, can have multiple vessels.

If only one vessel is permissible for a young, healthy monk, then having multiple vessels would be considered a weakness and a deviation from the path. In such a situation, there would be no purpose in practicing Uṇodari tapas. However, the scriptures like Bhagavati Sutra clearly mention and explain the practice of Uṇodari tapas.

Therefore, the only interpretation that is free from contradictions is that this passage from Acharanga Sutra refers to the type of vessel that is permissible for a young monk, not the number.

This clarifies that a monk can have multiple vessels, but it does not specify how many.

The passage about the three layers clearly states that a minimum of four vessels is permissible. In addition, three types of containers are mentioned: 1. Uccaramaatraka, 2. Prasravaṇamaatraka, 3. Khelaamaatraka.

While Prasravaṇamaatraka is necessary for everyone, Khelaamaatraka and Uccaramaatraka are necessary for some due to specific reasons.

Based on this passage from Acharanga Sutra or other reasons, the commentators have argued that having one vessel and one container is permissible. They attribute the rule regarding the container to Aryarakshit. This topic has been discussed extensively elsewhere. However, this argument holds no significance in the face of the scriptures mentioned above, and there is no tradition of having only one or two vessels.

In the description of the vows taken during the acceptance of Gochchaga-samyama, the term "Gochchaga" is mentioned separately from the vessel.

In Uttaradhyayanasutra 26, after the mention of the inscription of the Mukhavastrika at sunrise, the inscription of the "Gochchaga" is mentioned. This is followed by the mention of the inscription of the garment. Then, after the measurement of one and a half porisi, the inscription of the vessel is mentioned. 

Page #465:
---------------------------
## Sixteenth Uddeshak

[365 In these sutras, it is clearly established that "Gochchhag" is not a utensil related to a vessel, but a tool for cleaning in the transcription of clothes, which is called Pramanika (Poojani).
In the Prashnavyakaranasutra Shru. 2, A. 5, there are names of many tools and the word "Adi" is also used there, from which tools like Padappochan, Matrak, Asan etc. are included. In that text also, "Gochchhag" tool is said to be independent.
In Dashava. A. 4, along with the instructions of many tools, "Gochchhag" is also instructed separately from the vessel.
Commentators have considered and explained "Gochchhag" as a tool of the vessel itself and described it as a woolen cloth piece. But from the above explanation, it is appropriate to understand Gochchhag as Poojani.
In Brihatkalpa Sutra U. 5 and Prashna. Shru. 2, A. 5, there is a description of the "Paykesariya" tool. Which is a soft cloth-like tool for cleaning the vessel. To clean the vessel of Tumbe, the monk can also tie it with a small wooden stick, but the Brihatkalpasutra prohibits the Sadhvi from keeping it with a wooden stick. Sometimes it is also considered as "Gochchhag". But in the Prashnavyakaranasutra, the third tool is called "Paykesarika" among the tools of the vessel and Gochchhag is said to be separate, therefore both the tools are different. Gochchhag is used for cleaning clothes, body or other Upadhi and Paykesarika is used for cleaning the vessel.
For cleaning. Thus, both have different functions.
Rajoharan - This is an essential tool of the monk. It is necessary for all Sadhus, both Jinakalp and Sthavirakalp. It is so long that the ground can be cleaned while standing and it has such a circumference that the foot can be placed evenly on the cleaned ground. An excellent circumference can also be understood as 32 angulas. Special description should be known from the last sutras of Uddeshak five. It is used for cleaning while walking and for cleaning Asan, Shayya and house. It is also called 'Rishi-Dhwaj'.
In the Agamas, the monk is also called 'Achel' and 'Apaatra' (Karpatri). In the Bhashya etc., it is said to abandon all the tools except Muhpatti and Rajoharan, because these two are the main means of restraint and protection of life and the remaining tools are kept for the protection of the body and the importance of shame. Jinakalp etc. monks who have few Upadhis can also do the work of Gochchhag from Rajoharan.

9. Lime box for putting in water at night.
10. Soap, soda, surf etc. for cleaning clothes, utensils etc.
11. Ropes for drying clothes and for Chilamili etc.

The rules for keeping these instruments are not mentioned in the Agamas or commentaries. However, these worldly instruments can be kept only when absolutely necessary for restraint and the protection of the body etc.

Apart from this, all instruments kept only due to inclination or tradition are considered Parigraha (worldly possessions).

This [Nishīth sūtra] is related to the prāyaścitta sūtra presented in the utsargika upādhi. In it, the prāyaścitta for the violation of that which is available in the āgama by calculation or proof (measurement) should be understood from this. The remaining prāyaścitta should be understood according to the traditional samāchārī in the absence of proof.
In the present discussion, an attempt has been made to clarify the measurement of some instruments by inference, as their measurement is not available in the āgama.
The āgama states the guruchaumāsik prāyaścitta for keeping an additional upādhi without any reason or even after the reason has ceased. One who keeps the auxiliary instruments incurs guruchaatu māsik prāyaścitta. One who establishes a tradition of keeping the auxiliary instruments permanently incurs the prāyaścitta of utsūtraprūpaṇā, and those who keep them incur guruchaumāsik prāyaścitta. Therefore, the forceful establishment of any instrument like a stick, blanket, sthāpanāchārya, etc., should be understood as mithyāpravartan. The prāyaścitta for walking on places where there is a contradiction.
40. The monk who walks or stands on the infinite earth.
41. The monk who walks or stands on the purified earth.
42. The monk who walks or stands on the protected earth.
43. The monk who walks or stands on the earth made of clay.
44. The monk who walks or stands on the earth made of stone.
45. The monk who walks or stands on the stone made of stone.
46. The monk who walks or stands on the stone made of iron.
47. The monk who walks or stands on the kolavāsa, wood, or living beings, from the egg to the maggot stage.
48. The monk who walks or stands on the pillars, houses, walls, beds, or other places where there are inscriptions, which are not properly tied, not properly written, not compassionate, or unstable.
49. The monk who walks or stands on the walls, houses, stones, iron, or other places where there are inscriptions, which are not properly tied, not properly written, not compassionate, or unstable.
50. The monk who walks or stands on the shoulders, arms, platforms, canopies, garlands, seats, or other places where there are inscriptions, which are not properly tied, not properly written, not compassionate, or unstable.

13. A monk who, out of curiosity, wears clothes made from the skin of mice, etc., or adorned with various ornaments, or approves of someone who does so.
14. A monk who, out of curiosity, wears clothes made from the skin of mice, etc., or adorned with various ornaments, or approves of someone who does so. (He incurs the minor four-month penance.)
Discussion - A monk should be free from curiosity and have a serious nature. He should not associate with those who are curious. He should always be engaged in restraint, austerity, self-study, meditation, etc.
The discussion of Sutras 1 and 2 is in Uddeshak 12, and the discussion of Sutras 3 to 14 is in Uddeshak 7.
Wearing garlands, ornaments, etc., leads to a distortion of appearance. It also invites public censure. There is also the possibility of faults in obtaining and keeping these things. Therefore, these tendencies are inappropriate for a monk.
The penance for a Shraman or Shramani having their body cared for by another Shraman or Shramani, or by a householder, is 15-68. If a Niggranthi has their feet massaged by another Niggranthi, or by a householder, once or repeatedly, or approves of someone who does so, they incur the penance.
Similarly, according to the third Uddeshak, it should be known that if a Niggranthi, while traveling from village to village, has their head covered by another Niggranthi, or by a householder, or approves of someone who does so, they incur the penance.
69-122. If a Niggranthi has their feet massaged by another Niggranthi, or by a householder, once or repeatedly, or approves of someone who does so, they incur the penance.

##  376]
[Nishith Sutra]
A Nirgranthi covers the head of another Nirgranthi with a non-Jain or householder, or approves of someone doing so. (This incurs a Laghu-Chaumasik Pratikraman.)

**Discussion:** The Pratikraman for a Sadhu having a householder perform their bodily duties, etc., is mentioned in the 15th Uddeshak. Here, two speakers discuss the Pratikraman for a Nirgranthi having a householder perform bodily duties for another Nirgranthi, or for a Nirgranthi having a householder perform bodily duties for another Nirgranthi. Such behavior can lead to doubt about the Sadhu-Sadhvi's restraint, etc. These faults should be understood as similar to those mentioned in the Sutra about having a householder sew a Sanghati in the 5th Uddeshak. The discussion of all other Sutras should be understood as similar to the 3rd Uddeshak.

## Similar Pratikraman for not giving space to Nirgranthis
123. A Nirgranthi who, having space in their dwelling, does not give space to a Nirgranthi of similar conduct, or approves of not giving space.
124. A Nirgranthi who, having space in their dwelling, does not give space to a Nirgranthi of similar conduct, or approves of not giving space. (This incurs a Laghu-Chaumasik Pratikraman.)

**Discussion:** Those who have similar conduct, are similar in the 10 Kalpas of Achelky, etc., and do not accept food, clothing, bedding, or disciples that are tainted, are called "Sadhu of similar conduct." It is necessary to give space to such Sadhus in one's dwelling if there is space.

Even if a Sadhu comes due to some difficulty and is not of similar conduct, they should still be given space. Not giving space when there is space is a violation of Dharma-Shastra and leads to a loss of restraint, an increase in attachment and aversion. Therefore, a Sadhu or Sadhvi incurs Pratikraman according to these Sutras for such behavior.

## Pratikraman for accepting stolen food
125. A Bhikshu who accepts stolen food, drink, edible items, or delicacies that are being offered, or approves of someone doing so. (This incurs a Laghu-Chaumasik Pratikraman.) 

Page #477:
---------------------------
## Chapter Seventeen: The Seventeenth Uddesaka

[377]

**Discussion:** If food, etc., cannot be easily taken while standing on the ground, then taking it from a high place is considered a Malaprahita fault. In the Churni, this is explained with the distinctions of inferior, medium, and superior. It should be understood that this atonement applies to the superior Malaprahita. For example:

"Suttanipaato ukko sayammi, tam khandhamadisu havejja" - Commentary, verse 5952.

This means that food from high places like those where things are obtained using a ladder, etc., and similarly from low places like cellars, etc., should be considered Malaprahita.

There is a possibility of many faults arising from the ladder slipping or from the carelessness of the person climbing up or down. The ladder might fall, their hands or feet might break, or there might be slander like "It fell while climbing up or down to give it to the Sadhu, or the Sadhu made it fall."

The prohibition of Malaprahita food is clearly stated in Dasha. A. 5, U. 1, and in Aacha. Shru. 2, Pra. 1, U. 7. It is also stated as a cause of Karma-bandha, saying that it is against the principles of Pran, Bhut, Jiva, and Satva. In Pindaniyukti, it is mentioned as one of the Udgama faults.

Food given from a normal height, or from a means that does not fall, or from a permanent means of climbing up and down, is not considered to have the Malaprahita fault. Aacha. Shru. 2, A. 1, U. 7 also discusses this in detail.

**Atonement for taking food kept in a loft:**

126. If a monk takes food, drink, edible, or palatable items kept in a loft, by lifting them up or bending down, or approves of someone taking them in this way, (he incurs the atonement of Laghu-Chaumasika).

**Discussion:** Lofts are made of mud, dung, stone, or metal, etc. If the loft is excessively high or low, or very large, and if it does not require a ladder, etc., to take things out, but it is difficult to take things out, i.e., it requires painful actions like lifting up or bending down, then taking food, etc., from such a loft is prohibited in Aacha. Shru. 2, A. 1, U. 7, and its atonement is mentioned here.

This topic is mentioned in the Aacharaanga after the description of Malaprahita, making it a type of Malaprahita fault. In the atonement mentioned here, it is also mentioned after Malaprahita. In the commentary, it is also called "Tiryak Malaprahita." Refer to the Aacharaanga Sutra for further discussion.

**Statement:**

**Atonement for taking food from a different place:**

127. If a monk takes food, drink, edible, or palatable items that have been moved from their original place, by lifting them up or bending down, or approves of someone taking them in this way, (he incurs the atonement of Laghu-Chaumasika). 

Page #478:
---------------------------
[378]
[Nishīthasūtra
127. A monk who takes food, drink, food, or taste that is covered with a vessel smeared with mud, or approves of the one who takes it, (he incurs the minor Chauṃāsī prāyaścitta.)
Discussion-Here, the "ubbhinn" defect of origin has been taken from "maṭṭiolittan". Its prohibition is also in Ācā. Śru. 2, A. 1. U. 7 and Daśava. A. 5, U. 1. From the description in both those places, food that is opened from a vessel closed by all kinds of lids is inconceivable for a monk. This includes heavy substances or vessels and lids made of mud and plant leaves, etc., and lids packed with iron, etc. The reason for the statement that the killing of living beings is caused by opening them is that all types of lids are included. Only in the case of mud-coated, it is not possible to kill all the living beings like fire, etc. Therefore, even though the word "maṭṭiolittan" is there, one should understand the prohibition and prāyaścitta of food closed by various types of lids or coatings, etc., by implication.
After giving it to the monk, there is also a beginning in putting on many lids again, which causes the paścātkarma defect. Therefore, such food, etc., should not be taken.
Food covered with heavy substances should be understood as a heavy covering, as the giver may experience difficulty in lifting and keeping it, and the killing of living beings may be possible in keeping it, etc.
If there is no killing in opening and closing ordinary lids, and they can be easily opened or closed, there is no prāyaścitta in taking food that is given after opening them.
Prāyaścitta for taking food with defects
128. A monk who takes food, drink, food, or taste that is situated on the earth, or approves of the one who takes it. 

Page #479:
---------------------------
## The Seventeenth Uddeshak

[379 129. A monk who, with awareness, takes or approves of the taking of food, drink, or palatable food that is situated on water.
130. A monk who, with awareness, takes or approves of the taking of food, drink, or palatable food that is situated on fire.
131. A monk who, with awareness, takes or approves of the taking of food, drink, or palatable food that is situated on vegetation.
(He incurs the minor four-month penance.)]

**Discussion:** A monk should not take food or a vessel containing food that is situated on salt, earth, etc., or on water with awareness, or on a water vessel, or on embers or a stove, or on grass, vegetables, etc. with awareness.

**Explanation:** In Praachara Shruti 2, Chapter 1, Uddeshak 7, there is a prohibition against taking food placed on earth, etc. Here, the penance for that is laid down. By taking such food that is contaminated with the fault of being placed on something, there is violence to the one-sensed beings. This is the penance for the fault of being placed on something that is mentioned in this Uddeshak. In the commentary, it is said that the penance for the fault of being placed on something by another is a monthly penance, and if the food is placed on an infinite-bodied being, then the penance for taking it is the major four-month penance.

**Question:** When food is lifted from earth, etc. with awareness, the burden is removed from those beings and they get peace. So why is it prohibited to take such food?

**Solution:** One-sensed beings experience great pain from mere touch. When a monk lifts food or a vessel from something, some beings are crushed. This causes them great pain due to the monk. Because of this violence, it is prohibited to take such food and a penance is prescribed. (Churni)

Here, the penance for the fault of being placed on something is laid down. However, the penance for the fault of being "hidden" in food should also be understood from this Sutra, i.e., if food is taken after removing something placed on it with awareness, then the minor four-month penance is incurred.

Here, the penance is prescribed because of the violence to earth, etc. The fault of being touched is not mentioned in this Sutra or in the faults of food, but because of the violence to earth-bodied beings, etc., the penance for taking food that is touched with awareness should also be understood from this Sutra, similar to the fault of being hidden.

**Explanation:** In direct touch, violence is obvious. But in indirect touch, sometimes there is violence and sometimes there is not. Therefore, if violence is not possible, then there is no penance for taking food that has been indirectly touched. The same understanding of the Sutra and the penance should be applied to taking clothes and other equipment, as it is for food.

## Translation:

[380]
The *Nishīthasūtra Ācārāṅga Ṭīkā* states that the prohibition of the *nikshiptadoṣa* implies the prohibition of all ten *eṣaṇā* faults. Since all these faults are related to the violation of earth, etc., while consuming food, their atonement can also be understood from this sūtra. The atonement for consuming food that has been cooled down is as follows:

132. A monk who consumes extremely hot food, drink, *khādim* or *svādim* substances, which have been cooled down by:
1. a soup ladle, 2. a fan, 3. a *tāḍapatra*, 4. a leaf, 5. a piece of leaf, 6. a branch, 7. a piece of branch, 8. a peacock feather, 9. a peacock tail feather, 10. a cloth, 11. the edge of a cloth, 12. a hand, or 13. by blowing with the mouth or by fanning with a fan, etc., or who approves of someone who consumes such food, incurs the *laghu-cāumāsī* atonement.

**Explanation:**

Fanning with a fan, etc., inevitably leads to the violation of *vāyu-kāya* beings, and it is also possible to violate small flying creatures. Therefore, it is not appropriate for a monk to consume food that has been cooled down by such means (violating *vāyu-kāya* beings). This is prohibited in *Prācā. Śru.* 2, *a.* 1, *u.* 7, and the present sūtra states its atonement.

If hot food, etc., is placed in a wide vessel for some time to cool down, it can be consumed under certain circumstances, but it is essential to be mindful that no *sampātim* beings fall into it.

*Daśavai.* *a.* 4 states that a monk should completely renounce blowing with the mouth, fanning with a fan, etc., and approving of such actions.

The atonement for consuming hot food and water is mentioned here because it violates *vāyu-kāya* beings. The *Ācārāṅgasūtra* prescribes the consumption of hot food, etc., without violating *vāyu-kāya* beings, but one should not consume extremely hot food, etc., because:

* It is possible that the giver or the monk's hand, etc., may get burned by the splashes or steam while giving it.
* The giver may not be able to tolerate the heat and may drop the vessel, etc., from their hand.
* The monk's bowl may get damaged (due to disease, etc.) or may crack.

Therefore, a monk should not consume extremely hot food and water. They can be consumed only after the heat has subsided.

If the giver or the monk gets severely burned by hot water, it is a violation of Dharma. If the bowl breaks, it takes time to perform the necessary rituals or to find another bowl, which delays *svādhyāya*, etc., and hinders *samyama*.

## Chapter Seventeen:

**It should be understood that prohibition arises from obstacles in the course of actions or from other such causes, and that general warm water, etc., can be consumed.**

**[381]**

**Here, in many texts, two sutras are found regarding the atonement for consuming warm food and water, but in the commentary and the churni, the subject is completed by explaining only one sutra, and there is also only one sutra in the Acharanga Sutra. Therefore, only one sutra has been retained in the original text here.**

**Atonement for consuming water that has been washed immediately**

**133. A monk who consumes - 1. Utsvedim, 2. Sansvedim, 3. Chavalodak, 4. Varodak, 5. Tilodak, 6. Tushodak, 7. Yavodak, 8. Prosaman, 9. Kanji, 10. Gramlakandjik, 11. Shuddha Prasauk Jal -**

**1. Which has been washed immediately, 2. Whose taste has not changed, 3. Which has not been contaminated by living beings, 4. Which has not been transformed by weapons, 5. Which has not been fully purified -**

**Consumes such water or approves of the one who consumes it (he incurs the Laghu Chaumasi atonement).**

**Discussion:**

**In the Agamas, there are many mentions of the names of unpurified cool water, i.e., washing water. Among them, only eleven are considered acceptable, as mentioned in this sutra. Any other names that are available are all considered acceptable.**

**After becoming acceptable washing water, it does not become immediately consumable. It becomes consumable after about half an hour or a muhurta. The Churnikar, without specifying the time, has said to determine the time by intelligence. If taken immediately, then according to the present sutra, atonement is incurred.**

**In the Agamas, there are provisions for consuming various types of unpurified and non-purifiable water, and there is a prohibition against consuming purified and non-purifiable water.**

**1. There are 10 names of water that can be consumed - see A.S. 2, A. 1, U. 7, S. 369-370 - Dasha Pra. 5, U. 1, Ga. 106 (75)**

**2. There are 12 names of water that cannot be consumed - see A.S. 2, A. 1, U. 8, S. 373.**

**The Agama texts do not specify a definite number for the water that can be consumed and the water that cannot be consumed, but in the Agama texts for the water that can be consumed, there is also a provision for consuming other such water that can be consumed.** 

Page #482:
---------------------------
## 382]
[Nishith Sutra]
There is a prohibition against taking other types of non-acceptable water even in the section on the arrival of non-acceptable water. Therefore, it is clear that there can be many other types of imaginable and unimaginable water. 

Water does not become immediately non-living even after being used for weapons, therefore it is not acceptable. The same water becomes acceptable after some time when it becomes non-living. 

If there are seeds, kernels, etc. in the non-living water used for washing fruits, etc., even if such water is filtered and given, it is not acceptable. 

The sources of the Agamas that indicate washing water are as follows:

1. In Dasha Vaikalik, Chapter 5, Verse 1, Verse 106 (75), three types of washing water are said to be acceptable. Two types of washing water are mentioned according to Acharanga Sutra, Chapter 2, Chapter 1, Verse 7, Sutra 369, and 'War-Dhoyanam' is additional.
2. In Uttaradhyayanasutra, Chapter 15, Verse 13, three types of washing are mentioned. The mention of all three is in Pravachana Sutra, Chapter 2, Chapter 1, Verse 7, Sutra 369-370.
3. In Acharanga Sutra, Chapter 2, Chapter 1, Verse 7, Sutra 369-370, there is a prohibition against taking washing water of short duration, there is a provision for taking washing water of long duration, and there is also a provision for taking it automatically at the behest of the householder.
4. In Pravachana Sutra, Chapter 2, Chapter 1, Verse 8, Sutra 373, there is a mention of many types of washing water. If there are seeds, kernels, etc. in such water, even if it is filtered and given, it is not acceptable.
5. In Thaananga, Chapter 3, Verse 3, Sutra 188, there is a provision for 3-3 types of acceptable water in the fourth, sixth, and eighth tapas.
6. In Dasha Vaikalik, Chapter 8, Verse 6, there is a provision for taking hot water.

The 'Suddh Viyad' mentioned in Acharanga and Nishith is different from hot water, because there it is said that taking the freshly prepared Suddh Viyad is prohibited and there is a penance for it. Therefore, it should be understood as pure, cold water that is non-living.

The brief meanings of the acceptable and unacceptable washing water mentioned in the Agamas are as follows:

Eleven types of acceptable washing water:

1. Utsvedim - Washing of hands or utensils smeared with dough, 
2. Sansvedim - Water used for washing boiled sesame seeds, leaves, vegetables, etc., 
3. Tandalodak - Washing of rice, 
4. Tilodak - Washing of sesame seeds, 
5. Tushodak - Washing of husk or water made from husking grains containing husk, 
6. Javodak - Washing of barley, 
7. Payam - Avshravan - Water from boiled substances, 

Page #483:
---------------------------
## The Seventeenth Uddeshak

[383]

8. Sauvir-Kanji water, water in which hot iron, wood, etc. has been dipped, 9. Water made into Prasook by pure Vikat Harad, Baheda, ash, etc., 10. Varodak-water used to wash the vessels of food items like jaggery, etc., 11. Amlakanjik-water used to wash sour substances or the residue of buttermilk. These are twelve types of unacceptable washing water.

1. Pamrodak-water used to wash mangoes, 2. Ambadodak-water used to wash Amratak (a specific fruit), 3. Kapitthodak-water used to wash Kath or Kavith, 4. Beejpuroudak-water used to wash Bijore, 5. Drakshodak-water used to wash grapes, 6. Dadimoudak-water used to wash pomegranates, 7. Khajuroudak-water used to wash dates, 8. Nalikeroadak-water used to wash coconuts, 9. Karirodak-water used to wash Karis, 10. Badarodak-water used to wash berries, 11. Amlodak-water used to wash Amla, 12. Chichoudak-water used to wash tamarind.

Apart from these, hot water is also considered acceptable, which is of only one type. When water boils completely on fire, it becomes Achitt. This means that the water should be so hot that one cannot keep their hand in it. If it is less hot than this, it is not completely Achitt and cannot be considered. In the Tika, etc., it is mentioned that it becomes Achitt after three boils.

It is clear from the above Agam Sthalas that washing water, i.e., Achitt cold water, can be of many types. The names mentioned in the Agam are just examples. It is permissible for a monk to take water used to wash flour, rice, or any other food item, or water used to wash the vessels of food items, or water made completely Achitt by any other type of substance.

According to Dashavkalik A. 5 U. 1 Ga. 76-81, while accepting Achitt water, one should also have the discretion to consider whether this water can be drunk? Will it quench thirst or not? To decide this, one can even taste the water. If such water has been consumed, it should be considered unusable and discarded in a secluded, lifeless place.

In this Sutra, both the words 'Sauvir' and 'Amlakanjik' are used, while in other Praagams only the word 'Sauvir' is mentioned. Its meaning in the Tika, etc., is given as Kanji water, Arnal water, etc. In the Hindi dictionary, while explaining Kanji water, it is said to be a delicious and digestive sour water made from salt, cumin, etc. This suggests that the word 'Amlakanjik' is a synonym of the word 'Sauvir', which is sometimes added here as a synonym. 

Page #484:
---------------------------
[384]
[Nishiy Sutra]
It has gone. Because this word is not in other Agamas and its explanation is not in the commentary of this Sutra.
If the existence of both words is accepted separately, then the meaning of Sauvira is considered to be the water of Kanji and the meaning of Ambakanjiyam is considered to be the Aach of buttermilk, etc.
Considering the subjects of Agama-path, it becomes clear that the meaning of 'Sauvira' given in the commentary and the treasury, etc. is not relevant to the context. Because the water to quench the thirst of Achitt mentioned in the Sutra is drinking water and it is prescribed to drink it in tapasya up to Tela. Whereas the water of Kanji is a delicious prepared beverage which is not even considered to be drunk in Prayambila. It would be completely inappropriate to drink it in the tapasya of fasting, Bela and Tela. ..
The washing water of sour substances like Amla, Tamarind, etc. has also been mentioned separately in Aacha. Shru. 2, A. 1, U. 8, therefore, it may be relevant to the context to consider the word Sauvira as one and consider its meaning as the Aach of buttermilk. Or by accepting both words, the word 'Sauvira' can be considered as the water in which iron, etc. hot substances are dipped and cooled, and the word 'Amlakanjik' can be considered as the Aach that has settled on top of the buttermilk, then the two words in the Sutra can also be consistent.
The water washed with fruits can also be Achitt, because the juice of some fruits and the touch of other substances on them make the water Achitt after staying in the water for some time or washing. But in Pracha. Shru. 2, A. 1, U. 8, such water is considered to be Akalpanya due to the presence of the kernels, seeds or their beats in the water. Still, if Achitt water without seeds, etc. is available, it can be taken.
In the present Sutra, the word 'Shuddodak' is also mistakenly considered to mean hot water, but the word Ushnodak is used in the Agamas for hot water. Here, the subject is of immediate washing (Achitt water) and in Aacha. Shru. 2, A. 1, U. 7, Shuddodak (pure Achitt water) is mentioned in the description of such washing water.
Achitt water made or made from the portion of food and having many unpleasant tastes should be considered as Shuddodak. This includes water mixed with cloves, black pepper, Triphala, ash, etc. But considering Shuddodak as hot water is inappropriate. Because it has no relation to the atonement mentioned in the Sutra.
In Aacha. Shru. 2. A. 1, U. 7, it is also said that the monk should take Achitt water himself. The reason for this is that it is difficult for a monk to get pure Achitt water and it is also difficult to survive without water. Therefore, if pure Achitt water is available, sometimes the person giving water may be unable to lift the weight or the sister giving water may be pregnant or there may be Satchitt substances on the way to get it or there may be a possibility of killing living beings by their arrival, etc. reasons, the monk can take Achitt water on the advice of the householder or by obtaining permission from him himself. If the quantity of water is more, it cannot be lifted by carrying the vessel, then the monk can take it from his own vessel or from the householder's 

Page #485:

## Seventeenth Uddeshak

[385 It is possible to take water from a vessel, but there is no such provision in the Pragama for taking water for drinking. Nor is there a tradition of taking food in this way.
Once water becomes a-chit, it can become chit again over time. Because beings from the one-sense to the non-conscious five-sense can be reborn in the same body of the same form. - Suy 0 Shru 2, A 3
In the fifth study of the Dasha Vaikalika Churni, it is said that in summer, water heated for a day and night becomes chit in the afternoon, and in winter and rainy season, water heated in the morning becomes chit in the evening.
As - Gimhe Aho Rattenam Sachitti Bhavathi, Hemant Vasasu Puvanhe Katam Avaranhe Sachitti Bhavathi. - Dasha. Churni Page 61, 114
There has been a misconception for some time about washing water, that its time of being a-chit is not mentioned, or that life arises in it quickly, therefore it is inconceivable for a Sadhu.
Such a statement is not appropriate according to the Agamas. Because the Agamas have provisions for taking many types of washing water, as well as a prohibition against taking freshly prepared washing water and a penance for taking it. Taking the same washing water after some time is considered conceivable. Therefore, the acceptability of washing water is clear.
In the Kalpantar Vachya Tika of the Kalpasutra, many types of washing water are discussed and it is considered conceivable for a Sadhu to take them even in the penance of Teli. And those who prohibit it are called Dharma and Agama-independent and not afraid of hell. As
"Parakiyam Avasravanadipanamatinirasam api yadashanaaharataaya varnanyanti kanjikam chaanantakaayam vadanti tatteshamaevaaharalampattyam dharmagamanirapekshata durgaterebhirutata kevalam vyanyakti." - Kalpa. Samarthana Page 50
It is noteworthy here that the author of this explanation is a Tapgachch Acharya, who has said a lot targeting the Kharataragachch and Anchalagachch who prohibit Avasravan etc. - Kalpa. Samarthana Preface.
_ In response to this, Kharataragachch Acharya Jinaprabhasuri wrote a verse-based chapter called 'Tapotamtakuṭṭan', refuting the taking of warm water by the Pradhakarmi and defending the taking of cold water that is a-chit, and wrote a lot in a language of anger to the Tapgachch Acharyas. See - Prabhandha Parijat Page 145-146
In the commentary of Acharang Shru 1, A 1, U 3, there is a description of washing water being a-chit and being conceivable for a Sadhu. There is also a description of many types of substances that make water a-chit.
In Pravachnasaroḍdhara Dvara 136, Gatha 881, it is stated that a-chit cold water that is Prasauk is acceptable, and in Gatha 882, the time for both hot water and Prasauk cold water to remain a-chit is also

It has been said. In its commentary, it is clarified that the time for the water used for washing rice, etc., to remain unmindful is the same as that of hot water.

**Discussion:** If a monk were to describe the characteristics of his body in such a way as to say, "The lines on my hands and feet, the marks of the moon, the wheel, the goad, etc., and my well-proportioned and perfect body, these characteristics will surely make me an Acharya," then he would incur the Praayaschitta mentioned in the Sutras.

It is a fault to be proud of becoming an Acharya. Such pride may lead to someone becoming agitated, the knowledge of auspicious signs may become false, someone with animosity may try to kill him knowing that he will become an Acharya, etc. Knowing the possibility of such faults and understanding the teachings of the Bhagavan, a monk should not reveal such characteristics, but should remain serious and humble, progressing in the virtues of restraint.

Pride and self-praise lead to the loss of virtues and good deeds.

When establishing a new Acharya, a Sthavir or Acharya, etc., may want to know about the characteristics, or if an unsuitable person is being appointed to the position, then for the sake of the Sangha's dignity, one can reveal their characteristics, either by themselves or through others, but there should be no thought of pride, conflict, or stubbornness.

**Praayaschitta for Singing, etc.**

135. A monk who 1. sings, 2. laughs, 3. plays a musical instrument, 4. dances, 5. acts, 6. imitates the sound of a horse, 7. imitates the roar of an elephant, 8. imitates the roar of a lion, or approves of those who do so, incurs a Laghu-Chaumasik Praayaschitta.

**Discussion:** All the above activities are indicative of a curious mind and are born from the arising and stimulation of the karma of attachment. A monk strives for victory over the senses and the pacification of attachment, therefore these activities are unsuitable for him.

If singing is done for the purpose of promoting Dharma in a Dharmakatha, then it cannot be considered a subject of Praayaschitta. But if it is a song for entertainment, secular in nature, and the goal is to showcase singing skills, then it is worthy of Praayaschitta.

Laughing, playing musical instruments, dancing, acting, imitating someone out of curiosity, and imitating the sounds of animals like elephants, horses, monkeys, lions, etc., are all useless activities on the path of restraint and should be abandoned. These activities can also lead to self-restraint and harm to living beings. Those who do such things are called "Kaandapika" in Uttaradhyayanasutra 35, who, being opposed to restraint, attain a bad destiny. Therefore, the Sutras mention Praayaschitta for such activities.

**388.** However, if one has to make some kind of sound for protection from danger, then one should not consider it to be a transgression.

**Penance for the Attachment to Sound**

**136.** A monk who goes to hear, or approves of someone going to hear, the sounds of: 1. a *bherī*, 2. a *paṭaha*, 3. a *muraja*, 4. a *mṛdanga*, 5. a *nāndī*, 6. a *jhālara*, 7. a *vallarī*, 8. a *ḍamaru*, 9. a *maḍuya*, 10. a *saduya*, 11. a *pradeśa*, 12. a *golukī*, or other such *vitata* musical instruments.

**137.** A monk who goes to hear, or approves of someone going to hear, the sounds of: 1. a *vīnā*, 2. a *vipancī*, 3. a *tūṇa*, 4. a *vavvīsaga*, 5. a *vīnādika*, 6. a *tumbavīnā*, 7. a *jhoṭaka*, 8. a *ḍhaṅkuṇa*, or other such *tata* stringed instruments.

**138.** A monk who goes to hear, or approves of someone going to hear, the sounds of: 1. a *tāla*, 2. a *kaṁsatāla*, 3. a *lattika*, 4. a *gohika*, 5. a *makarya*, 6. a *kacchabhi*, 7. a *mahatī*, 8. a *saṇālikā*, or other such *ghana* percussion instruments.

**139.** A monk who goes to hear, or approves of someone going to hear, the sounds of: 1. a *saṅkha*, 2. a *vaṁsa*, 3. a *veṇu*, 4. a *kharamuhi*, 5. a *pariliśa*, 6. a *vevā*, or other such *jhūsira* wind instruments.

## The Seventeenth Uddesaka

[389-139. A monk who goes or approves of someone going with the intention of hearing the sound of 1. a conch, 2. a bamboo instrument, 3. a flute, 4. a kharmuhi, 5. a parilis, 6. a veva, or other such *jhuser* musical instruments.
(He incurs the *laghu* four-month penance.)

**Discussion:** The twelfth *uddesaka* discusses the penances for attachment to forms, and here the penance for attachment to sounds is mentioned.

This set of four sutras mentions four types of musical instruments.
In the *Acharanga Sutra* (2, 11), in the sutras prohibiting attachment to sounds, this set of four sutras is also present, but there the names of the instruments are fewer, and here they are more.

In the *Nishita Chani*, the explanation of very few sounds has been given, the remaining sounds have been said to be "well-known". Their detailed discussion should be seen in the discussion of the *Acharanga Sutra*. Briefly,

* *Vitata* - Instruments without strings or made of leather - tabla, dhol, etc.
* *Tata* - Instruments with strings - veena, etc.
* *Ghan* - Instruments played by striking them against each other - jalatarang, etc.
* *Jhuser* - Instruments with a hole in the middle - flute, etc.

"If the sound of these instruments falls on the ears of a monk without his desire, he should not develop any attachment to it." This is the first sentiment of the fifth great vow. Therefore, going with the intention of hearing them is completely inconceivable. A detailed description of this topic should be known from the discussion related to the conquest of the senses in the twelfth *uddesaka*. There is no penance for hearing the sound of instruments like *bhamha* (drum) for the purpose of preventing disease. Similarly, other reasons should also be understood.

**Penance for hearing sounds and attachment in different places**

140-154. A monk who goes to villages or houses with the intention of hearing sounds, or approves of someone going with that intention. Similarly, all the sutras mentioned in the twelfth *uddesaka* should be understood in relation to sounds. A monk who goes to crowded places or other places with the intention of hearing loud sounds, or approves of someone going with that intention.

155. A monk who is attached to, enjoys, craves, or is absorbed in sounds, whether they are 1. in this world, 2. in the other world, 3. loud, 4. soft, 5. pleasant, 6. unpleasant, 7. known, or 8. unknown, or is becoming attached, enjoying, craving, or absorbed in them.

He incurs the four-month penance for violating the *parihara* rules.

140-154. Just as in the 12th Uddeshaka, a monk who goes to a field or a house with the intention of hearing sounds, or approves of someone who does so, and so on, all the sūtras should be understood from the 'speaker of sound'. Similarly, a monk who goes to a place with many oxcarts or other places with great noise, with the intention of hearing sounds, or approves of someone who does so.
155. A monk who is attached, addicted, greedy, and excessively greedy for:
1. worldly sounds, 2. otherworldly sounds, 3. visible sounds, 4. invisible sounds, 5. previously heard sounds, 6. unheard sounds, 7. known sounds, 8. unknown sounds, or approves of someone who is attached, addicted, greedy, and excessively greedy for these.

For consuming the places mentioned in these 155 sūtras, Laghu-Chaumāsi Prāyaśchitta arises.
Discussion - The entire discussion of these 16 sūtras should be understood according to the 12th Uddeshaka. The Chūrṇikāra has also indicated this.

**Discussion:** 1. A monk is completely renounced, being averse to harming *ap-kāya* beings, therefore, it is not appropriate for him to travel by boat.

*Āchārāṅga Sūtra*, *Bṛhatkalpa Sūtra* and *Daśāśruta Skandha* prescribe the use of a boat for specific purposes as an exception. This is explained in the 12th *uddeshaka*.

The main reason for traveling by boat mentioned in these sūtras is to follow the *kalpa* rules. Additionally, 1. going for service, 2. going to areas where food is easily available when it is scarce, 3. when the land route is crowded with living beings, 4. when the land route is excessively long (the proportion is to be known from the commentary), 5. when there is fear of thieves, non-Aryan people or violent animals on the land route, 6. when a king or someone else has forbidden a certain area, then it is prescribed by the *āgama* to board a boat to cross a river that can be crossed by boat, or it is considered to be with a proper purpose. They do not incur penance from this sūtra, but the penance for harming *ap-kāya* beings, etc., should be understood according to what is said in the twelfth *uddeshaka*.

## The Eighteenth Uddeshak

[397]

The Thaanag Sutra, A. 5, mentions some reasons for traveling during the rainy season. If, due to these reasons, one has to cross a river or other water body by boat, then it is considered a justified boat journey and the prescribed atonement does not apply.

Sitting in a boat for the purpose of seeing a boat, fulfilling the desire for a boat journey, wandering from village to village, visiting pilgrimage sites, or for no reason or a general reason is considered a pointless journey. The atonement for this is mentioned in the first Sutra.

2-5. Even if one has to travel by boat due to a compelling reason, it is not permissible to travel in a boat that is tainted with the faults of being bought, etc., as mentioned in the Sutra. This means that the boatman should take the traveler without any payment, and then the atonement does not apply. If the boat is tainted with the faults of being bought, etc., then the atonement mentioned in the Sutra applies.

6-9. For a Sadhu, traveling in a boat that is being brought from the shore into the water, or from the water to the land, or being pulled out of mud, or being cleaned by removing water from it, the atonement mentioned in the Sutra applies. This means that if all the preparations for other passengers are done beforehand, then the atonement mentioned in the Sutra does not apply.

10. If the boat crossing the river is large and is far from the shore, and one has to use another small boat (Pratinaava) or other means to reach it, then the atonement applies. This means that if the boat is near the shore and one can reach it on foot as mentioned in the Praachaa Shru 2, A. 3, U. 1, then the atonement mentioned in the Sutra does not apply.

11. It is not permissible to travel in a boat that is going with the flow or against the flow of the river. However, it is permissible to travel in a boat that cuts across the width of the river to reach the opposite bank. The prohibition against traveling in such a boat is mentioned in Aachaa Shru 2, A. 3, U. 1, and here the atonement for it is mentioned.

12. Even if the width of the river is small, if the speed of the water flow is fast and the boat has to travel a long, diagonal path, causing the boat to travel more than half a yojana or even a full yojana, then it is not permissible to travel in such a boat at that time. The atonement mentioned in the Sutra applies. Therefore, if the boat crosses the river in less than half a yojana, then the atonement mentioned in the Sutra does not apply.

Here, the words "yojana" and "ardha-yojana" are used. This means that generally, one should not travel in a boat that travels more than half a yojana. However, if one is forced to travel due to a very difficult situation, then a monk can travel in a boat that travels a full yojana. But he should completely avoid traveling in a boat that travels more than a full yojana.

13-14. The Aachaarang Sutra, in its description of boat travel, states that if, after boarding the boat, the boatman asks for help in rowing the boat, the monk should not agree but remain silent. 

Page #498:
---------------------------
## 398]
[Nishith Sutra]
The Sutra states the atonement for engaging in activities related to pulling, pushing, and navigating a boat, which are mentioned earlier.
15-16. If water fills a boat for any reason, it is not permissible for a monk to remove it using a vessel or any other means, or to close any hole from which water is entering, or to inform the boatman. The monk should remain focused in meditation, maintaining peace of mind and patience.
If these boat-related activities are performed due to circumstances, the atonement mentioned in the Sutra is applicable.
17-32. 1. On land by the river (in a place with consciousness), 2. In mud, 3. In water, 4. In a boat - a monk residing in these four places cannot accept food from a householder residing in these four places.
Acha. Shru. 2, A. 3, U. 1 states that when a monk reaches the riverbank for a boat ride, he should abandon all four types of Prahar and perform Sagari Santhara, along with keeping food and other necessities. In this case, there is no option to accept new food. Because the monk is situated in a place where there is a possibility of harming living beings, it is not appropriate for him to perform Prahar. He should remain steadfast and abstain from yogic practices. Generally, even if water droplets fall on the body due to rain or other reasons while on a journey, food is not consumed until they dry.
Due to the reasons mentioned in the discussion of the first Sutra, if it is necessary to travel by boat, and there is no other way to cross the water-filled path, the Sutra allows for boat travel. If the water is knee-deep, the method of walking across is mentioned in Pra. Shru. 2, 3, U. 2. If the body becomes weak or due to any other physical reason, the monk can stay in one place. - Vyav. U. 8, Su. 4
The boat travel mentioned in the Sutra is not for the purpose of traveling for preaching and influencing others, because Nishith U. 12 and Dasha. D. 2 allow for this only twice a month and nine times a year. This is only related to crossing the river to follow the rules of the Kalpa. Apart from this, it is inappropriate for a monk who walks on foot to take a vow to use vehicles for preaching and influencing others in a life of restraint.
According to the Utsarga rules, walking is the most appropriate way for a monk who practices restraint, and according to the exception rules, the Agama allows for crossing a limited water path by boat. The use of other vehicles is prohibited in Prashna. Shru. 2, 5. This includes elephants, horses, chariots, palanquins, and other vehicles. In special circumstances, their exceptional use should be decided wisely based on the Geetaarth's instructions. The reasons for using vehicles should be understood in relation to the atonement for Ritas and other faults, according to these boat Sutras. 

Page #499:
---------------------------
## Eighteenth Uddeshak]
[399
In crossing a water-way by boat, the **apkayik** beings have more **viraadhana** (violation) when there is a special reason, and the **kayik** beings have less **viraadhana**.
For other means of transport, the **vayukayik** beings have more **viraadhana**, the **tejaskaayik** beings have less **viraadhana**, and the remaining **kayik** beings have even less **viraadhana**. According to Uddeshak 12, Sutra 8, one obtains **prāyaścitta** (atonement) for these **jiva-viraadhana** (violations of living beings).
The **geetarth** (scriptural interpretation) determines the consumption of exceptions, their limits, and the **prāyaścitta**.
Using vehicles other than those mentioned in the **āgama** (scripture) and **vyākhyā** (commentary) is considered **akāraṇa** (without reason), therefore, the **prāyaścitta** for their **akāraṇa** use should be understood according to the first Sutra, and **prāyaścitta** is not obtained for **sākāraṇa** (with reason) vehicle use. This is also clear from the first Sutra.
However, the **prāyaścitta** for **gaveṣaṇā** (investigation) etc. faults and **viraadhana** related faults applies to both **sākāraṇa** and **akāraṇa** vehicle use. This is the meaning of these Sutras.
The detailed description of the rules and prohibitions related to boat travel and the **upsargajanaya** (adverse) situation has been given by the Sutrakar himself in **Prācā** (ancient) **śruti** (scripture) 2, **a** (chapter) 3, **u** (uddeshak) 1-2. Therefore, the meaning and word meanings should be known from there.
**Prāyaścitta** for faults related to clothing
33-73. If a **bhikkhu** buys clothes, has them bought, accepts clothes brought for a **sadhu**, or approves of the one who accepts them, etc., all the Sutras should be said according to the fourteenth **uddeshak** with the **vatthābhilāva** (desire for clothes), until the **bhikkhu** stays in **cāturmāsya** (four-month retreat) for clothes or approves of the one who stays.
The consumption of the fault-places mentioned in these Sutras results in **laghu-cāturmāsya** (short four-month retreat) **prāyaścitta**.
**Vivecana** (explanation) - These 41 Sutras related to clothing should be understood with wisdom in the same way as the 41 Sutras related to **pātra** (utensils) in the fourteenth **uddeshak**. 

Page #500:
---------------------------
##  Translation:

[400]
[Nishisha Sutra]
The Chanikara has stated that there are 25 sutras instead of 41, and has also indicated that the meaning should be understood as similar to the 14th Uddeshak. The Churnikara, in stating the number of sutras as 25, has counted the number of sutras related to old and foul-smelling clothes in two sutras, and has also counted the eleven sutras related to drying the vessels as one sutra. This results in a reduction of 16 sutras, leaving only 25 instead of 41. Thus, there is only a difference in the way the number of sutras is counted, but there should be no fundamental difference in the number of sutras.
The sutra related to performing Korani in a vessel should be understood here as meaning embroidery in clothes, etc.
6-9
Summary of the Eighteenth Uddeshak
Sailing in a boat or traveling in other vehicles without a very important purpose. 2-5 Boarding a boat with defects like cracks, etc.

Using clothes with defects.  The minor four-month atonement applies to these activities.
The subject matter of the 42 sutras of this Uddeshak is mentioned in the Acharanga Sutra. 2-16 The rules and prohibitions related to boats are described in a systematic manner.
-Pracha. Shru. 2, A. 3, U. 1-2 33-36 And the subject matter of these 27 sutras should be understood as similar to sutras 1-4 and 8-30 of the fourteenth Uddeshak for clothes. 40-62 -Pracha. Shru. 2, A. 6, U. 1-2 

Page #501:
---------------------------
[Eighteenth Uddeshak]
[401 The subject matter of the 31 sutras of this Uddeshak is not found in other Agamas, such as the prohibition of boat travel without an essential purpose. 17-32 Not to eat food in water, land, mud, or boat during boat travel. 37-39. The subject matter of these fourteen sutras is to be understood as similar to sutras 5-7 and 31 to 41 (63-73) of the fourteenth Uddeshak for the same garment. This Uddeshak discusses the atonement for garments and boats in 73 sutras, and no other subject matter is discussed. This is the special feature of this Uddeshak.

6. A monk who carries medicine and travels from village to village, or approves of one who does so.
7. A monk who takes medicine himself, gives it to others, or accepts it from someone who gives it, or approves of one who does so. (He incurs the minor four-month penance.)
Discussion - The word "viyad" used in the present sutras has been used in many meanings in many Agamas. For example:
1. In the Brihatkalpa Sutra, Uddeshak 2, Su. 4-7, it has been used as an adjective for cold water, hot water, sura and sauvira, such as:
1. Ciodag viyad kumbe va, 2. Usinodag viyad kumbe va, 3. Sura viyad kumbe va, 4. Sovira viyad kumbe va, etc.
2. In the Brihatkalpa Sutra, Uddeshak 2, Su. 11-12, the word "viyad" has been used in the sense of an open house. Nirgranthas are ordained to stay in such open houses, and Nirgranthis are prohibited from staying there.
3. In the Dasha Shruta Skandha, Dasha 6, the word "viyadbhoji" is used in the sense of day food for the Shravaka in the Chhatto Pratima.
4. In the Prajnapanapada 9, the word "viyad" is used in the sense of a type of "yoni" as the place of birth of beings, such as "viyada joni".
5. In the Thananga Sutra, Pra. 3, the word "viyad" is used in the sense of a type of medicine for a sick monk. There, it is ordained that three types of "viyad datti" should be taken for the sick.
6. In the Dasha. Da. 8, there is a passage "viyadgam bhocca pecca" in the ordinance that when a sadhu goes to Gochari and it rains on the way, he should sit in a safe place and eat and drink water.
7. In the Pracha. Shru. 1, Pra. 9, U. 1, Ga. 18, Bhagwan Mahavir Swami did not commit any kind of sinful karma, did not consume the sin of pradha karma, and "ate the food of the mind" in this sense, the word "viyad" is used, such as - Tam akuvvam viyadam bhu njiththa. Here, the independent word "viyad" is indicative of the strike.
Thus, in the Agamas, where the word "viyad" is an adjective for unmindful hot water, unmindful cold water, it is also an adjective for "madya" such as sura - sauvira etc. It is also in the sense of medicine, food-water, day food, and bed and yoni.
The present case is about the penance related to the ordinance mentioned in the Thananga Sutra. 3. In both places, the acceptance of "viyad" is related to the sick, so here, many substances in the form of medicine should be understood by the word "viyad". 

Page #504:
---------------------------
[404]
These Sutras mention Datti-Khurak (dosage), also state that it should not be taken on a journey, and also mention melting it. Therefore, here, opium etc. in the form of medicine can also be understood in the word "Viyad".
Opium is used to stop diarrhea or to induce sleep for the peace of the sick. It is considered a successful medicine for these purposes. The dosage varies for each person. Therefore, the statement of the Thanang Sutra regarding the heinous, medium, and excellent dosage also becomes consistent. Many times people use opium by dissolving it in water and grinding it in a mortar. This allows for the use of a very small amount of opium. If necessary, it can also be easily taken on a journey.
Except for the melting process and the three dosage Sutras, the remaining five Sutras can occur in many other medicines. Therefore, here, instead of understanding "Viyad" as a specific substance, understanding it as all types of medicines, both general and specific, makes the meaning of the presented Sutras clear.
The word "Viyad" has not been defined in the Channi commentary, and the explanation has been given only with the meaning of "madya" in mind. However, in the Brihatkalpa Sutra etc., the words "Majj", "Sura", "Sauvir" have been used for "madya", and the word "Viyad" has been used as an adjective with them. Which is also used as an adjective for water there. Therefore, from the seven Agam proofs mentioned above, it is not possible to use the word "Viyad" for "madya". In Dashakalik A. 5, U. 2, verse 36, there is also the use of "Suran va Meragan vaavi, Annan va Majjagam Rasam", but there is no use of the word "Viyad".
In the Agamas, "madya-mansa" has been said to be "abhakhya" and "varjaniya" for the virtuous. Their consumption has been described as the cause of hell in the Thanang Sutra, and in the pre-Agam texts related to "madya", the word "Viyad" alone has not been used in place of "madya" anywhere. Therefore, it cannot be said that the meaning of "madya" for "Viyad" is consistent with the Agamas.
From the above-mentioned Agam references, it is also clear that the word "Viyad" is mostly used as an adjective with another word. The independent use of the word "Viyad" is only in Dasha. D. 8 in the sense of food-water, and in the present case of Thanang and Nishita in the sense of medicine, and in Acharang in the sense of harmless food.
1-4. These Sutras state the atonement for the faults of "eshana". According to Uttara. A. 2, verse 33, a monk should not even desire medicine if he has the power of endurance, the spirit of conquering disease, and enthusiasm. But if a monk has to take medicine to maintain his samadhi, then he should search for pure, harmless medicine without consuming the faults mentioned in these Sutras, such as "krit" etc. The atonement mentioned in the Sutras comes from consuming medicine with the above-mentioned faults. The same atonement should be understood for consuming "pathya ahar" etc. with the above-mentioned faults. A detailed discussion of these faults can be seen in the fourteenth Uddeshak. 

Page #505:
---------------------------
## Nineteenth Uddeshak]
[405
5. Each monk's minimum, medium, and maximum dosage of specific medicines like opium, etc. (natural digestive capacity) varies, therefore they should not consume more than that. Or they should not consume more than three doses in a day. Because many medicines, when taken in excess, cause intoxication or other harm. Therefore, this sutra advises caution regarding the dosage of medicine.
Elsewhere in the Agamas, the word "datti" is used in the sense of "one unbroken stream." But here, in the context of medicine, it is appropriate to use "dosage of medicine." Because the quantity of medicine is measured in tola, masha, ratti, etc., but not in "one stream" or one rib, etc. Even today, the quantity of specific medicine is mentioned in "grams" or the quantity of liquid medicine is mentioned in terms of a lid or a drop.
Although it is necessary to pay attention to the quantity in every medicine, it is more important to pay attention to the quantity in opium or other chemical medicines.
The atonement provision in this sutra for consuming more than three doses should be understood in relation to opium, amber, etc., intoxicating substances or gold bhasma, etc., chemicals. If consumed in excess, it may raise doubts about the monk in the mind of the giver or other observers. Excessive consumption can also lead to suicide by a monk, therefore such substances should not be brought in excess.
6. The previous sutra mentions three doses, which can be taken over three days, one dose each day. By then, the disease that has arisen is usually calmed.
Just as a monk in a vihara cannot carry food and water after two kos, similarly, he cannot carry medicine from village to village. If necessary, the monk can stop at a place and take medicine. Carrying medicine along in the vihara leads to an increase in many faults, increases the tendency to accumulate wealth, and there is also fear of the state or thieves. Due to these reasons, the atonement for carrying medicine along in the vihara is mentioned in this sutra.
7. Soaking any medicine in water, melting it, grinding it in a mortar, and other crushing and grinding activities increase negligence, cause harm to sanpatim, etc., living beings, and lead to various types of suffering. Therefore, monks should not perform these actions. It is appropriate to use medicine that is readily available. Performing other actions also leads to a loss of time for study, etc. Even if a householder performs these activities and gives medicine to a monk, these faults should be understood. For these reasons, atonement is mentioned in this sutra.
8. The monk who wants to perform the evening meditation, performs it or is performing it. That is - 1. In the early evening, 2. In the late evening, 3. In the twilight, 4. In the night.

A monk who studies the scriptures or approves of someone studying the scriptures in the four sandhyas: morning sandhya, evening sandhya, midday, and midnight, incurs the minor four-month penance.

**Explanation:**

The four sandhyas are:

1. **East Sandhya:** The reddish hue in the eastern direction at sunrise is called "East Sandhya." This is the junction of night and day. The reddish hue persists for a longer time before sunrise and for a shorter time after sunrise. This time is approximately one muhurta.
2. **West Sandhya:** Similar to the East Sandhya, the West Sandhya should be understood as the time of sunset. The reddish hue in the western direction persists for a shorter time before sunset and for a longer time after sunset. This entire period of the reddish hue is called "West Sandhya."
3. **Afternoon:** The middle of the day. The middle muhurta of the day, based on the number of muhurtas in the day, is called midday. In the sutra, it is called "Afternoon." This time usually falls between 12 noon and 1 pm. Sometimes it may be slightly earlier or later.
4. **Midnight:** The middle of the night is called "Midnight." It should be understood similar to "Afternoon."

The middle of the day and night are considered unsuitable times for reading secular scriptures. The other two sandhyas are mentioned in the scriptures as the time for performing pratikramna and writing down the shayya upadhi. Studying the scriptures during these times would infringe upon the time for these essential activities.

These four times are for the movement of the Vyantara Devas. Therefore, if there is any negligence, it is possible for them to cause trouble. In the secular world, morning and evening are considered times for worship and remembrance, and midnight is considered the time for the movement of spirits.

By not studying the scriptures during these four times, the monk gets some rest. The duration of these four sandhyas is as follows:

1. **East Sandhya:** 24 minutes before sunrise and 24 minutes after sunrise, or 36 minutes before sunrise and 12 minutes after sunrise.
2. **West Sandhya:** 24 minutes before sunset and 24 minutes after sunset, or 12 minutes before sunset and 36 minutes after sunset.

From a subtle perspective, the duration of these sandhyas is as long as the reddish hue persists, which may be slightly shorter or longer than the above durations.

3-4. **Midday and Midnight:** Traditionally, the time from 12 noon to 1 pm is considered the midday and midnight. From a subtle perspective, it is one muhurta in the middle of the day or night.

The recitation, reading, and study of the original text of the Agamas should not be done during these four Sandhyas. Because, according to the present Sutra, the performance of Swadhyay leads to the consumption of knowledge (Akale ko Sajjhapro) and other defects, resulting in the Laghu Chaumasi Pratikshepa.

## Pratikshepa for violating the limits of Kalikat in Utkal
9. The Bhikshu who asks more than three questions from the Kalikashrut in Utkal, or approves of the one asking, (he should perform Laghu Chaumasi Pratikshepa).
10. The Bhikshu who asks more than seven questions from the Drishtivad in Utkal, or approves of the one asking, (he should perform Laghu Chaumasi Pratikshepa).

## Explanation
For Kalikat, the first and last Prahar of the day and night are the time for Swadhyay, and the second and third Prahar are Utkal. Therefore, Swadhyay of Kalikashrut is not done during Utkal, but some exceptions are mentioned here for the purpose of memorizing new studies, etc., in which seven questions are prescribed for Drishtivad and three questions for other Kalikashrut, such as Acharang, etc.

"Hi Siloh Ega Puchcha, Tihi Puchchahim Nav Siloga Bhavanti Evam Kaliyasuyass Egataran. Dittivaye Sattasu Puchchasu Egaavinsan Siloga Bhavanti." - Churni Bha. Ga. 6061.

One question consists of three Shlokas, and three questions make nine Shlokas. This is for each Kalik Sutra. For Drishtivad, there are twenty-one Shlokas for seven questions. That is, twenty-one Shlokas of Drishtivad and nine Shlokas of other Kalikashrut can be recited, etc., during Utkal.

The word "Puchcha" generally means to ask and answer. But for asking and answering, there is no question of Swadhyay or the time of Swadhyay, so this meaning is not relevant here in this context.

The word "Puchcha" has many other alternative meanings, which should be known from the Bhashya.

The Vad Sutra has a detailed description of many subtle and subtler topics, Bhang Bhed, etc., so its Puchcha is said to be more, so that more of its text can be recited together.

There is no clear definition available in the Agamas that distinguishes between Kalikat and Utkalikashrut. But in the Nandi Sutra, a list of Kalik and Utkalik Sutras is available. From this, it is clear which Agamas are Kalik and which are Utkalik. But the reason why the Agamas are Utkalik or Kalik is not explained there. 

Page #508:
---------------------------
[408]
Of the 32 available Agamas, 9 Sutras are Utkalika, namely:
1. Uvvaisutr, 2. Rayapaseniyasutra, 3. Jivajivabhigamsutra, 4. Prajnapanasutra, 5. Suryaprajnaptisutra, 6. Dasavaikalikasutra, 7. Nandisutra, 8. Anuyogadwarasutra, 9. Avasyakasutra. The remaining 23 Agamas, including the eleven Angas, are Kalikasutra.
The Nandisutra lists the names of 29 Utkalika Sutras and 42 Kalika Sutras. Including the Avasyakasutra, the total number of Sutras is 72.
The Avasyakasutra is referred to as an Utkalika Sutra in the Anuyogadwarasutra. The Nandisutra classifies 5 out of the 12 Upanga Sutras as Utkalika and seven as Kalika. Similarly, it classifies one each as Kalika and Utkalika from the Chandraprajnapti and Suryaprajnapti respectively. Therefore, a definitive definition cannot be established from this.
Agamas composed by Ganadharas are considered Kalika. The Pragamas, which are quoted verbatim from the Angasutra without any modification, are also considered Kalikasruta, as they represent the original form of those Angasutras. However, Agamas composed by other Purvadharas in their own style should be considered Utkalikasruta. This is because they may retain the original meaning but not the original form of the Sutra.
The tradition of considering the number of Agamas to be 32 or 45 should be understood as a mere assumption based on different perspectives and a specific time and place. In reality, the list of 72 Sutras mentioned in the Nandisutra represents the Agamas available at the time of its composition. It also includes the Nandisutra itself, which was composed by a Purvadhara named Sri Devarddhigani Kshama Shraman (Devavachaka). The list also includes the names of numerous other Agamas composed by different Purvadharas.
There is no authentic historical record of the time of composition or the authors of many Agamas. The fragmented sections of the Mahanishoth and other Sutras mentioned in the Nandisutra have been completed with supplementary texts. The definition of Agamas in the scriptures is as follows:
Suttam Ganahar Raiyam, Taheva Pattey Buddhar Raiyam Cha. Suy Kevalina Raiyam, Abhinna Das Pugvina Raiyam ||154||
- According to this verse from the Brihatsangrahani, the compositions of every Buddha, Ganadhara, 14 Purvas, and all ten Purvadharas can be called Sutras or Agamas.
According to the Nandisutra, the Shruta of different ten Purvadharas can be both Samyag and Asamyag. However, the Shruta of those who have fully embraced the ten Purvas (when applicable) is always Samyag.
_ The authors of four Chedasutras, Dasavaikalikasutra, and Prajnapanasutra are known and are considered to be ten Purvas and fourteen Purvadharas. The Avasyakasutra and eleven Angasutras are considered to be composed by Ganadharas. However, in the Prashnavyakaranasutra, etc., the entire subject matter composed by Ganadharas has been removed and replaced with other topics, which are not mentioned in the Nandisutra. The authors of many other available Sutras are unknown.

The term "Shruta" as used in the definition of "Agam" (sutra) is very limited. Currently, the tradition is to refer to 32 Shragam or 45 Agam, which includes many Agam in addition to the sutra as defined, and some commentary texts are also counted as sutras, such as Shakti etc.

Shruta composed by a Jnani from ten Purva to one Purva can also be considered Samyak and can be called Agam. This is clear from the list of Utkalik Shruta and Kalik Shruta in the Nandi Sutra. The author of the Nandi Sutra accepted the 72 sutras available at the time of its composition as Shragam. Among them are also Shruta composed or compiled by many one-Purva holders, who were Bahushruta.

Therefore, it is only prejudice to not consider those 72 sutras, which are available and have not undergone any significant alteration or damage, as Agam. This also clearly shows the disrespect towards the author of the Nandi Sutra. It is also not appropriate to consider those 72 sutras as pure Pragam, which have been interpolated with formulations contrary to the fundamental principles of Ahimsa etc.

It is completely inappropriate to insist on considering other sutras, texts, commentaries, bhashyas, niyukti, churni, nibandhagranth or samaachari-granth etc. as Shragam or equivalent to Shragam, apart from those 72 sutras.

It is certain that at the time of the composition of the Nandi Sutra, no other sutras, texts or commentary texts composed by previous holders were available. If some were available, they would have been included in the Shruta list, as this list also includes Shruta composed by unknown authors and many one-Purva holders. Therefore, there can be no reason to not mention in any form the Shruta composed by many Purva holders or 14 Purva holders, which were available. Therefore, it is clear that all other sutras, commentaries, texts etc. were composed after the composition of the Nandi Sutra. However, due to the corruption of historical accounts, there are prevalent misconceptions that commentary texts were also composed by fourteen Purva holders etc.

In the present Prayashchitta Sutra, one should understand the evidence of three prishchas, i.e., 9 shlokas, regarding the study of the available Kalik Sutras among the Agam mentioned in the Nandi Sutra.

The twelfth Ang Sutra, called Drishtivad, is currently fragmented. Therefore, the evidence of 7 prishchas, i.e., 21 shlokas, should not be understood for any currently available sutra. Even for those sutras which are extracted (uddhrit sankalit) from Drishtivad and are Kalik Sutras, one should understand the evidence of only three prishchas [9 shlokas] due to their becoming independent laghusutras.

If it is necessary to pronounce the original text of these sutras in Utkal, then there is no Prayashchitta for pronouncing 9 shlokas together. Pronouncing more than this amount of text will incur the Prayashchitta mentioned in the sutra.

**Penance for Studying during Great Festivals**

11. A monk who studies during the four great festivals, or approves of one who does so, is subject to penance. These festivals are: 1. Indramahotsava, 2. Skandamahotsava, 3. Yakshamahotsava, 4. Bhutamahotsava.

12. A monk who studies during the four great pratipadas, or approves of one who does so, is subject to penance. These pratipadas are: 1. Ashoya-padivae, 2. Kattiy-padivae, 3. Sugimhag-padivae, 4. Ashadhi-padivae.

**Explanation:**

These two sutras state that studying on the days of the full moon and the following pratipada (first day) of the months of Ashadha, Ashoj, Kartik, and Chaitra is subject to penance.

The Thananga Sutra (4) prohibits studying on the four pratipadas. The order of these pratipadas in the Thananga Sutra is: "Ashadha Padivae, Indamah Padivae, Kattiy Padivae, Sugimhag Padivae." The same order is mentioned in the Nisithabhashya (verse 6065): "Ashadhi, Indamaho, Kattiy, Sugimhao ye boddhvvo. Ete maha maha khalu, chev padava."

The order mentioned in the Thananga Sutra and the Nisithabhashya is the same. In this order, Indramahotsava is in the second place, which clearly indicates that it is the full moon and pratipada of Ashadha.

It seems appropriate to understand the remaining three festivals mentioned in Sutra 11, Skanda, Yaksha, and Bhuta, as the full moon and pratipada of Kartik, Chaitra, and Ashadha respectively. However, this explanation is not provided in either the Thananga Tika or the Nisithachurni.

The original text of these sutras, as found in available manuscripts, places Indramahotsava first among the great festivals and Ashoj full moon (Indramahotsava) and pratipada third among the great pratipadas. However, the above-mentioned commentary and verse interpret the text according to the Thananga Sutra. Therefore, the original text of the Nisith Sutra must have also been in accordance with the Thananga Sutra.

Thus, it is clear that Indramahotsava, the full moon of Ashoj, is in the first place in the sutra. Skandamahotsava, the full moon of Kartik, can be considered to be in the second place, as Skanda is also known as Kartikeya. The remaining festivals, Yaksha and Bhuta, are... 

Page #511:

## Nineteenth Uddeshak]
[411
There is no basis to determine the exact day, however, according to the order, the Yaksha Mahotsav can be considered to be on the full moon day of Chaitra and the Bhoot Mahotsav on the full moon day of Ashadha.
In Aacha. Shru. 2, A. 1, U. 2, there is a mention of many festivals. The names of the four festivals mentioned in the present eleventh sutra are also there, but the order is different, as follows:
1. Inda Mahasu va, 2. Khand Mahasu va, 3. Rudd Mahasu va, 4. Mugud Mahasu va, 5. Bhuya Mahasu va, 6. Jakkha Mahasu va, 7. Nag Mahasu va.
Here too, in the mention of festivals, Indra and Skandha Mahotsav are mentioned in the first and second places. Therefore, the conclusion is that according to the Indra, Skandha, Yaksha and Bhoot Mahotsav of the eleventh sutra, the order of the words in the twelfth sutra should be as follows:
Ashoji Pratipada, Kartiki Pratipada, Chaitri Pratipada and Ashadhi Pratipada. Therefore, this order has been accepted in the present sutra 12.
These four festivals are respectively related to Indra, Kartikeya Deva, Yaksha and Bhoot Vyantar jati Devas, i.e., people worship and honor them to please them, and they spend the whole day drinking, singing, dancing, roaming, drinking alcohol, etc., enjoying themselves. These festivals are held on the full moon day. The arrival of the Devas also continues during these days, and many people also travel here and there. On the Pratipada day, some of the program of these festivals remains, hence it is also called the Pratipada day of the Mahamahotsav.
The reason for the prohibition of Swadhyaya is that the Devas who travel during those days are of many types, small and large, and they are also of different temperaments and curious. These Devas can cause trouble if they make a mistake in Swadhyaya. Even if there is no mistake, the more prosperous Devas can cause trouble.
On the days of enjoyment, entertainment, pleasure and joy, the reading of scriptures is considered impractical in the world. People also travel in various kinds of intoxication and can cause trouble out of curiosity or hatred. Due to these reasons, there is no Agam permission to do Swadhyaya in these eight days.
From the instructions of these four festivals, in the main days of other festivals mentioned in the Pracharang Sutra, which are prevalent everywhere, Swadhyaya should not be done or should not be done in a loud voice.
The word 'Ashadhi Pratipada' etc. in sutra 12 should be understood as the Pratipada coming after the Ashadhi Purnima, i.e., Shravan Vadi Ekam. But it should not be understood as 'Ashadhi Purnima followed by Ashadha Vadi Ekam'. Similarly, the remaining three Pratipada should also be considered as the Pratipada coming after the Purnima of that festival.
In many places in the Agams, in the descriptions of Tirthankaras etc., the first Krishna Paksha and the second Shukla Paksha are clearly mentioned in every month. For example, in Pracharang Shru. 2, A. 15:
"Gimhanam Padhame Mase Docche Pakkhe Chett Suddhe, Tassanam Chett Suddhass Terasi Pakkhenam"...... . 

Page #512:

[412]
[Nishiy Sutra]
Here, while describing the birth of Bhagwan Mahavira on the thirteenth day of the bright fortnight of Chaitra, the second fortnight of the first month of the summer season is called Chaitra Suddha (Sudi). Similarly, there are descriptions elsewhere as well. Therefore, it is scripturally correct to understand that the first day of the next month comes after the full moon.
In common practice, the number (30) thirty is written for the new moon and this is considered the last day of the month. But this belief is not scripturally correct. Many scholars consider this common belief to be based on the presented Sutra (12), but understanding such meaning from this Sutra is misleading. Because this meaning has not been given in the Thananga Tika or the Nishith Churni, and also, deriving such meaning from the text of the mentioned Acharanga A. 15 is against the scriptures.
Therefore, the full moon of Ashadha, Asauj, Kartik and Chaitra and the first day of Shravan, Kartik, Margashirsha and Vaishakh, these eight days should be considered as Asvadhyaya.
Although the full moon of Asauj is mentioned in the Jain scriptures for Indra Mahotsav and also in non-Jain scriptures, different traditions have become prevalent over time in different regions. For example, the Churnikar has mentioned that Indra Mahotsav takes place on the full moon of Shravan in the Lat country. Similarly, due to some reason, the tradition of considering the full moon of Bhadava as a festival day and considering it as Asvadhyaya is prevalent. Due to this, a total of 10 days are considered as Asvadhyaya related to the festival. But this should be understood as only a tradition because there is no original evidence for it.
In the presented Sutra, eight days have been mentioned according to the above description, and performing Swadhyay on them leads to the prescribed atonement mentioned in the Sutra.
Atonement for not performing Swadhyay during the Swadhyay period
13. Je Bhikkhu Chaukalam Uvainavaei, Uvainaventam Va Saizjzai.
13. A monk who spends the four Swadhyay periods without performing Swadhyay or approves of someone who does so. (He receives the Laghuchoumasi atonement.)
Discussion - The first and last Paurashis of the day and the first and last Paurashis of the night, these four Paurashis are the Swadhyay periods according to the Kalikashrat. Not performing Swadhyay in these four periods and spending time in other Vikatha, Pramad etc. is an excess of knowledge, as - "Kale Na Kao Sajjao, Sajjaae Na Sajjaaiyam". Prav. A. 4
Performing this excess leads to the atonement mentioned in the Sutra. The implication is that a monk must perform Swadhyay in all four Paurashis except for essential service work.
Loss due to not performing Swadhyay 1. Not performing Swadhyay causes the previously acquired Shruti to be forgotten. 2. New Shruti is not received and its growth does not occur.

**3.** Precious time is wasted in idle talk and other distractions.
**4.** The qualities of restraint are destroyed.
**5.** One is deprived of the benefits of self-study, austerity, and purification. As a result, the cycle of birth and death cannot be broken. Therefore, a monk should consider self-study as his paramount duty.

**Benefits of Self-Study**

**1.** Self-study leads to abundant purification.
**2.** Scriptural knowledge becomes stable and rich.
**3.** Faith, detachment, restraint, and interest in austerity increase.
**4.** The qualities of the self are strengthened.
**5.** Success is achieved in controlling the mind and senses.
**6.** Self-study is said to be the foundation of Dharma meditation, and it leads to concentration of the mind. Consequently, one attains Dharma meditation and pure meditation.

**Inspirational Agamic Sayings for Self-Study**

**1.** *Sajjhayammi Rao Saya* - A monk should always be engaged in self-study.
**2.** *Bhocca Sajjhayaraye Je Sa Bhikkhu* - He is a monk who has attained faultless knowledge.
**3.** *Sajjhaya - Sajjhaanarayassa Taaino* - The karma of the six protectors of the body is purified for those who are engaged in self-study and meditation. (Dasavai. Pra. 8, Ga. 62)
**4.** *Naanam Eggachitto Ya Thio Ya Thavai Param. Suyani Ya Ahijitaa Rao Suya Samahie* - Knowledge makes the mind one-pointed, the knower himself is stable in Dharma, and he makes others stable. Therefore, one should study the scriptures and remain in scriptural meditation. (Dasavai. Pra. 10, Ga. 15)
**5.** *Sutattham Cha Viyaanai Je Sa Bhikkhu* - He is a monk who has special knowledge of the sutras and their meaning. (Dasavai. Pra. 10, Ga. 9)
**6.** *Uttaara. Pra. 29* mentions numerous benefits, including purification, resulting from self-study and its five divisions, such as reading.
**7.** *Uttaara. Pra. 26* describes the daily routine of a virtuous person, emphasizing the allocation of significant time for self-study. This is analyzed in *Nishith Churni* as follows:

"One should engage in the study of scriptures at the beginning and end of the day, and also at the beginning and end of the night. In these four periods, one should study and contemplate. In the remaining time, one should engage in the study of scriptures during the second part of the day. One should listen to the meaning of the scriptures, and this is also a form of meditation. In the third part of the day, one should beg for alms. If one does not go out, one should study the scriptures during that time. One should study what one has learned previously..." 

Page #514:
---------------------------
[414]
The *Kalikashrut* is studied in all four *kalas*, while the *Utkalikashrut* is studied or its meaning is grasped in the other *praharas*. In the third *prahara* of the day, one should not engage in the study of the *Utkalikashrut* or other activities. In the second *prahara* of the night, one should either study the *Utkalikashrut* or sleep. In the third *prahara* of the night, one should sleep and then wake up and engage in the study of the *Utkalikashrut* if time permits. Then, in the fourth *prahara*, one should study the *Kalikashrut*.

This is a description of the daily routine of a *sadhu*, which is filled with study. In the *paurushi* of the *utkala*, one can engage in the study of the *sutras*, the meaning of the *sutras*, food, sleep, and other activities. However, in all four *kalas* and *paurushi*, only study is performed. According to *Uttara. A. 26*, if a *guru* or someone else asks for service during the time of study, one should perform it. If not, one should remain absorbed in study.

This study is of the *Kalikashrut*. It includes memorizing new material or repeating what has already been memorized. Once the new material has been memorized, one only needs to repeat it.

*Vyav. U. 4* states that it is essential for *sadhus* and *sadhvis* to retain the knowledge they have learned. If they forget, they are subject to the most severe *prayaschitta*. This means that if they forget due to negligence, they will not be given any position for the rest of their lives. If they are already holding a position, they will be removed from it. Only elderly *sthaviras* are exempt from this *prayaschitta*.

Therefore, memorizing the *shrut* and keeping it stable can only be achieved through continuous study.

*Uttara. A. 26* describes study as the *uttaraguna* of *samyama*. It is said to liberate one from all suffering and purify all *bhavas*.

By holding these teachings in their hearts, *bhikshus* should always be engaged in study and avoid the *prayaschitta* mentioned in the *sutras*. This means they should not waste time on idle talk, negligence, or other activities besides study.

**Prayaschitta for Studying During the Time of Non-Study**

14. A *bhikshu* who studies during the time of non-study or approves of someone who does so, receives the *laghuchoumasi prayaschitta*.

**Discussion:** While it is essential to engage in *svādhyāya* (self-study) both during the day and night, one must always be mindful of the times when *svādhyāya* is prohibited, as outlined in the *āgamas* (scriptural texts).

The following *āgamas* describe the places where *svādhyāya* is prohibited:

1. **Thaṇāṅga Sūtra, Chapter 4, Verse 4:** Prohibits *svādhyāya* on the four *pratipadās* (first days of the lunar fortnight) and the four *sandhyās* (twilight periods).
2. **Thaṇāṅga Sūtra, Chapter 10:** Mentions ten *ākāśīya* (celestial) and ten *audārika* (worldly) *asvādhyāya* (prohibited times for *svādhyāya*).
3. **This present Uddeshak:** Describes the *prāyaścitta* (atonement) for performing *svādhyāya* during the four *mahā mahotsavas* (great festivals), four *pratipadās*, and four *sandhyās*.
4. **Vyavahāra Uddeshak, Chapter 7:** Prohibits *svādhyāya* related to one's own body.

By compiling all these prohibited places, we arrive at a total of 32 *asvādhyāya* places. These include those related to the sky, the world, festivals, the first days of the lunar fortnight, and twilight periods.

**Total 32:** Out of these, 12 *asvādhyāya* have been discussed in previous *sūtras* (texts). The remaining 20 *asvādhyāya* are as follows:

1. **Ulkāpāt:** The falling of a star, meaning its displacement. When a star-vehicle moves sideways or a deity performs *vikūrvaṇā* (distortion), it appears as if a star is falling in the sky. Sometimes it appears as a long line falling, sometimes as a luminous object falling. Generally, the phenomenon of stars falling in the sky is a continuous process, therefore, if it is accompanied by a specific light or a line, it should be considered *asvādhyāya*. This lasts for one *prahara* (three hours).

2. **Digdāh:** Due to the transformation of *pudgala* (matter), a condition resembling a great city burning in one or more directions is visible. This appears slightly above the ground. This lasts for one *prahara*.

3. **Garjan:** The sound of thunder. This lasts for two *praharas*. However, it is not considered *asvādhyāya* during the *varṣā-nakṣatras* (rain constellations) from *Prāṇa-nakṣatra* to *Svāti-nakṣatra*.

4. **Vidyut:** The flashing of lightning. This lasts for one *prahara*. However, it is not considered *asvādhyāya* during the aforementioned rain constellations.

5. **Nirghāt:** The flashing of lightning accompanied by a terrible [horrible] sound. This is also called lightning striking or thunder. This lasts for eight *praharas*.

## Nishīthসূত্র (Nishīth Sutra)

**6. Yūpaka:** The mixed state of time during sunset and lunar eclipse on the first, second, and third days of the Shukla Paksha (bright fortnight) is called Yūpaka. During the first prahar (watch) of these days, there is asvādhȳāya (unfavorable time for study). This is also called the asvādhȳāya of the बालचन्द्र (young moon).

**7. Yakṣadīpta:** The sight of numerous forms of luminous pudgalas (particles) in the light. This has an asvādhȳāya of one prahar.

**8. Dhūmikā:** The falling of dark smoke. As long as it persists, there is asvādhȳāya.

**9. Mahikā:** The falling of ordinary smoke without darkness. As long as it persists, there is also asvādhȳāya. During both these asvādhȳāyas, to avoid violating the apkāya (body), bodily and verbal activities like copying are also not performed. The time for these occurrences is the months of Kārttika, Mārgaśīrṣa, Pauṣa, and Māgha. In other words, during these months, sometimes, in some places, smoke or mahikā falls. In some years, it may not fall in some areas.

A similar sight occurs in mountainous regions when clouds move around. However, their nature is different from smoke, so there is no asvādhȳāya for them.

**10. Raj Udghata:** The covering of light by dust and the falling of dust. As long as it persists, there is asvādhȳāya. The Bhāṣya (commentary) states that if dust falls for three days with awareness, then after that, apart from study, copying, etc., should also not be done because dust spreads everywhere with awareness. These are the ten asvādhȳāyas related to the sky.

**11-12-13. Hadḍī-Māṃsa-Khūna-Tiyanc:** If bone or flesh is visible within 60 hastas (cubits) for animals and 100 hastas for humans, there is asvādhȳāya. If the bones are burnt or washed, there is no asvādhȳāya. Otherwise, there is asvādhȳāya for 12 years. The same should be understood for teeth.

If blood is visible or its smell is present, there is asvādhȳāya. Otherwise, there is no asvādhȳāya. In other words, the limit of 60 hastas or 100 hastas does not apply to this. There is asvādhȳāya for three prahars for the blood of animals and for a whole day and night for human blood.

If a girl is born in a house near the upāśraya (Jain temple), there is asvādhȳāya for eight days, and if a boy is born, there is asvādhȳāya for seven days. In this, the limit of seven houses attached to the wall is considered. If a birth occurs for an animal, there is asvādhȳāya for three prahars after the placenta falls.

**14. Aśuci:** As long as human excrement is visible or its smell is present, there is asvādhȳāya. If the smell of animal excrement is present, there is asvādhȳāya, otherwise not. There is asvādhȳāya near a urinal, etc., where the smell of human urine is present. There is also asvādhȳāya where the smell of city drains and sewers is present. If any human smells the bodily pudgalas of an animal, there is also asvādhȳāya.

15. **Asvadhyaya** (prohibition of study) occurs around a **shmashan** (cremation ground).

16. **Surya Grahan** (solar eclipse): If it is **apurn** (partial), **asvadhyaya** lasts for 12 **prahar** (3 hours), and if it is **पूर्ण** (full), it lasts for 16 **prahar**. **Asvadhyaya** should be considered to begin from the start of the eclipse. Alternatively, **asvadhyaya** lasts for the entire day and night of the eclipse, and not on the following day.

17. **Chandra Grahan** (lunar eclipse): If it is **apurn** (partial), **asvadhyaya** lasts for 8 **prahar**, and if it is **पूर्ण** (full), it lasts for 12 **prahar**. This should be understood from the beginning of the eclipse. Alternatively, **asvadhyaya** should be considered from the beginning of the lunar eclipse that night until the next day's **chandrodya** (moonrise). After that, **asvadhyaya** does not continue.

18. **Patan** (fall): When a prominent person like a king or minister dies, **asvadhyaya** should be considered in that city until the mourning period ends and a new king is established. **Asvadhyaya** should also be considered for one **aho-ratra** (day and night) in their kingdom.

19. **Raj-vyudgrah** (war): **Asvadhyaya** occurs near the location of the war or in the capital city where the war is taking place. After the war ends, **asvadhyaya** lasts for one **aho-ratra**.

20. **Audarik Kalevar** (corpse): If a human corpse is lying in an **upaashray** (temple), **asvadhyaya** occurs within 100 **haath** (cubits). If it is a **tiryanch** (animal) corpse, **asvadhyaya** lasts for 60 **haath**. However, according to tradition, **asvadhyaya** lasts within the boundaries of the **upaashray** as long as the **audarik kalevar** remains. **Asvadhyaya** lasts for 3 **prahar** for a dead or broken egg.

These are the ten **asvadhyaya** related to **audarik** (corpse). The discussion of all these 20 **asvadhyaya** is mainly based on the **bhashya** (commentary), so refer to **Nishith Bhashya** verses 60786162; **Vyav. U. 7 Bhashya** verses 272-386; **Abhi. Ra. Kosh** part 1 page 827, the word "**asajjhaiy**".

If one studies during these 32 types of **asvadhyaya**, it is a violation of **jina-gyan** (Jain knowledge) and may even lead to **upadrav** (disturbance) by the **dev** (deities). It also does not constitute pure **gyanachar** (practice of knowledge) but rather **atichaar** (excess).

Studying **svadhyay** (self-study) in **dhumika** (introduction) and **mahika** (main part) also contradicts **apkay** (non-violence).

Studying **svadhyay** during the ten **asvadhyaya** related to **audarik** also goes against **lok vyavahar** (social conduct) and does not respect the **sutra** (scripture).

Studying **svadhyay** during war and the death of a king may cause **apreeti** (displeasure) or **dvesh** (hatred) towards the **sadhu** (saint) from the king or royal officials.

The main reason for prohibiting **svadhyay** during **asvadhyaya** is that **Bhag. Sh. 5, U. 4** states that **dev** (deities) speak in **ardhamagadi** language, which is also the language of the **agams** (scripture). Therefore, there is a possibility of **upadrav** (disturbance) by **mithyatvi** (false believers) and **kautuhali** (curious) **dev**.

These locations of **asvadhyaya** also indicate that the practice of **svadhyay** involves repeating the **pragama** (scripture) with clear pronunciation. It is in this context that these **asvadhyaya** are mentioned.

[These are the Nishītha Sūtras. However, there is no Asvadhyāya (unsuitable study) in studying the Āgama which is translated in relation to these. 

The specific rule regarding Asvadhyāya is that there is no Asvadhyāya in the reading and recitation of the essential Sūtras, because this is always to be done at the time of both Sandhyās (twilight). Therefore, the recitation of the "Namaskāra Mantra", "Logass" etc., essential Sūtras can be read or spoken always and everywhere.

If one becomes aware of any Asvadhyāya, then to complete the remaining study or objective, there is a Prāyaścitta (atonement) for studying.

If one needs to purify the blood etc. of a Tiryanch (non-human) Panchendriya (five-sensed being) or a human being with water, then one should go 60 hands or 100 hands away from the study place and do it. The blood or body of a Tri-indriya (three-sensed being) or Chatur-indriya (four-sensed being) is not considered Asvadhyāya.

If there is a highway in the midst of the Audārika (impure) substances, then there is no Asvadhyāya. Even if there is any Audārika Asvadhyāya left after studying properly in the Upāśraya (monastery) and outside up to 60 hands, then the Prāyaścitta mentioned in the Sūtras does not apply.

Therefore, the Bhikshu should study by transcribing and considering all types of Asvadhyāyas during the day, and at night, he should transcribe the Kāla-pratilekhan (time-transcription) in three places where all directions and the sky are clearly visible when standing. Due to rain etc., Kāla-pratilekhan can also be done in a house sometimes.

In a very large group of Śramaṇas, two Sadhus (monks) do Kāla-pratilekhan after taking permission from the Āchārya (teacher), then all the Sadhus study after being informed. If the cause of Asvadhyāya is known in between, then the study is stopped after making a complete decision about it.

Even though Svādhyāya (study) is a means of inner penance and great Nirjarā (purification), studying in Asvadhyāya violates Jināgnā (Jain teachings), leads to Karma-bandha (bondage of karma) due to violation of rules, sometimes brings disgrace, therefore, it leads to violation of restraint and Prāyaścitta. - Nishītha Chūṇī presents this Sūtra.

Therefore, the Svādhyāya-priya Bhikshu should always be careful about Asvadhyāyas.

**Prāyaścitta for studying in one's own Asvadhyāya**

**15.** Je Bhikkhu appano asajjhaie sajjaayam karei, karentam vā saijjai.

**15.** The Bhikshu who studies in his own physical Asvadhyāya or approves of the one who studies (receives the Laghu-chaumāso Prāyaścitta).

**Discussion:** One's own Asvadhyāya is of two types: 1. Wound-related 2. Menstrual-related. In this, the Bhikshu has one type of Asvadhyāya and the Bhikshuni has both types.

When blood or pus comes out of boils, ulcers, warts etc. in the body, then there is Asvadhyāya. After purifying it, one can study outside 100 hands.

## Nineteenth Uddeshak

[419. Even after purification, if blood etc. continues to flow, then self-study cannot be done. But by tying one or two excellent three-layered cloths, mutual recitation of Agamas can be done. If blood appears again outside the three layers, then it is necessary to purify them again.

The period of non-self-study during menstruation lasts for three days. But in Uddeshak 7, Sutra 17 of Vyavahar Sutra, the provision of mutual recitation during one's non-self-study period is mentioned. Its commentary explains the procedure as follows: After purifying blood etc., by applying one or two or, if necessary, seven excellent layered cloths, Sadhus and Sadhvis can mutually recite Agamas. For proof, see Vyav. U. 7, Commentary Ga. 390-394 and Nishithabhashya Ga. 6167-6170. And Abhi. Rajendra Kosh Part 1, Page 833 "Asaj

It should be understood that all the non-self-study Agamas mentioned in Sutras 14 and 15 are related to the recitation of their original text, as they are in the language of the Gods.

Therefore, there is no prohibition on understanding the meaning of Agamas, or on contemplation, questioning, listening to explanations, etc. during menstruation, etc. Similarly, there is no prohibition for householders to perform Samayik, etc., Sanvara practices, daily rituals, and remembering the Lord, etc.

If the rules of Agama self-study are applied to Dharma practices like Samayik, Pratikraman, etc., then it would be a violation of the principle of differentiation and would hinder all Dharma activities. It is an inappropriate attempt to apply the rules of one subject to another.

When the Agama-maker himself prescribes the recitation of Agamas during one's own non-self-study period due to menstruation, etc., in Vyav. Uddeshak 7, then it is absolutely not appropriate for any Acharya to prohibit the recitation of Samayik, Pratikraman, remembering the Lord, Namaskar Mantra, and Logassa, etc.

Because, if such an opposite view of the Agama is held, then even on the day of the Sanvatsari Mahaparva, one would be deprived of all religious practices like Pratikraman, listening to explanations, seeing the Muni, and reciting Namaskar Mantras, etc. A householder deprived of all Dharma practices would be engaged in careless conduct and negligence even on festival days, therefore, such differentiation is completely inappropriate.

Therefore, during their own non-self-study period, Shravaks and Shravikas should perform Samayik, Pratikraman, etc., activities with discretion, and there should be no fault in this. And during these three days of abstinence from household duties, they should spend the maximum time in Sanvara, etc., Dharma activities. Sadhvis should also spend their time in other studies, listening, service, penance, self-reflection, meditation, etc.

Penance for reciting Agamas in the opposite order:

16. The monk who recites the lower Samavasarana while being in the higher Samavasarana, or vice versa, commits a sin.

17. The monk who recites the lower Brahmacharia while being in the higher Brahmacharia, or vice versa, commits a sin.

[420]
[Nishīthasūtra
16. A monk who recites or approves the recitation of later recitation-worthy sūtras without first reciting the earlier recitation-worthy sūtras.
17. A monk who recites or approves the recitation of Uttamaśruta without first reciting the first Śruta-skandha called Nava-brahmacarya-adhyayana. (He incurs the Laghu-cāumāsī prāyaścitta.)
Discussion - Just as a group of people sitting together and listening to someone's discourse is called "samavasarana", similarly, the Āgama which contains the collection of discussions of many principles is also called "samavasarana".
Just as the first (or lower) floor of a house is called "heṭṭhill" (adhastana) and the second floor is called "uvarill", similarly, here in the sūtra, the Āgama of the first recitation is called "heṭṭhill" and the Āgama of the subsequent recitation is called "uvarill".
Therefore, the Āgama, Śruta-skandha, adhyayana, uddeśaka, etc., which are to be recited first in sequence, are recited first, and those which are to be recited later are recited later. For example:
1. The recitation of Ācārāṅgasūtra is done first and the recitation of Sūyagaḍaṅgasūtra is done later.
2. The recitation of the first Śruta-skandha is done first and the recitation of the second Śruta-skandha is done later.
3. The recitation of the first adhyayana and in it also the first uddeśaka is done first and the recitation of the subsequent adhyayana uddeśakas is done later.
The Cūrṇikāra has stated here that the Āvaśyaka-sūtra is the first recitation-sūtra in comparison to the Daśavaikalika. The Daśavaikalika-sūtra is the first recitation-sūtra in comparison to the Uttarādhyayana-sūtra. Even in the Āvaśyaka-sūtra, the Samāyika adhyayana is the first recitation-worthy, the remaining adhyayana are recitation-worthy in sequence thereafter.
Vyav. U. 10 gives the order of recitation of the Kālika sūtras and also explains the relationship of the dīkṣā paryaya. In that order, the Utkalikaśruta and Jñātādharmkathā etc. angas are not mentioned. Only the order of Ācāraśāstra and Saṅgraha śāstras is given. Therefore, it should be understood that there is no definite order of the Jñātādi Kālika-sūtra and Uvvai etc. Utkalika sūtras which describe the story or the life of a tapasvi samyami. And many sūtras have been composed and compiled after the composition of the Vyavahāra-sūtra. Therefore, their study order is not there. Therefore, the Gītartha Muni can recite them whenever he finds an opportunity. The prāyaścitta mentioned in the present sūtra should be understood as an inversion of the order mentioned in the Vyavahāra-sūtra.
The above order of Āvaśyaka-sūtra and Uttarādhyayana-sūtra mentioned by the Cūrṇikāra should be understood as the order before Ācārāṅga.

The first Shruta Skandha of the Acharyaanga Sutra describes the teachings that encourage steadfastness in restraint, detachment and faith, as well as the ideas of Parishhajay, etc. Brahmacharya is a synonym for restraint or it is the main part of restraint. Therefore, the first Shruta Skandha is known as "Nav Bhamcheer". One country takes the whole. Therefore, Churnikar has said - "Nav Bhamcheer Gahnen Samvo Ayaroo Gahito Ahva Savvo Charananuogo" i.e. from the statement of Nav-Brahmacharya, the entire Acharyaanga Sutra or the entire Charananuyog (the science of conduct) should be taken.
The reference to the Chhedasutra and Drishtivad Sutra from "Uttamashrut" is made in the Bhashya Ga. 6184.
The Chhedasutras are called "Uttamashrut" because they describe the Utsarga, Apavad Kalpas, as well as the Pratikshetra and Sangha system.
Drishtivad is also called Uttamashrut because it describes the four Anuyogs and the subtle description of substances from Nay and Praman, etc., and because it is very vast.
The meaning of the 17th Sutra is that when a monk with special qualifications becomes steadfast in the knowledge and practice of the principles of restraint, he is given the reading of "Uttamashrut".
Or, we can also understand that the 17th Sutra is an exception to the 16th Sutra, because in the 17th Sutra, the word "Uttmasuyam" is often found in all the copies as "Uvarimsuyam".
From this perspective, the combined meaning of both the Sutras is that if any Sutra, etc., is read in reverse order, then Pratikshetra arises, but if it is absolutely necessary to read the later Sutras due to special reasons, then at least the first Shruta Skandha of the Acharyaanga Sutra should be studied and Pratikshetra arises even if the later Sutras are read without studying it.
In this exceptional situation, there may be many reasons like lack of time for the Sutra-arth-vicched or the reader, etc. But if any order is violated without any exceptional circumstances, the reader incurs Pratikshetra. The defects in reading in reverse order are:
1. Not understanding the later subject without understanding the previous subject, 2. The opposite result of Utsarga-Apavad, 3. Not studying the previous subject after studying the later subject, 4. Being called Bahushrut, etc., without full qualification, etc. Therefore, all the Sutras should be read in the order prescribed by the Agamas.
In these Sutras and in many other Sutras that will be found later, Pratikshetra has been mentioned for the reader, but there is no provision for Pratikshetra for the listener. The reason for this is that it is the responsibility of the reader to decide who should be given what reading?
The word "vachana" has been used in the Sutras to refer to the study of the meaning, and the words "uddesha, samuddesha" have been used to refer to the study of the original Agama. But here

[Nishīthasūtra]
It should be understood that this is a prāyaścitta (atonement) concerning both the text and its meaning, in brief, from the Vācanāsūtra, since there are no separate sūtras.
From these two sūtras and their discussions, the order of Vācanā can be understood as follows: 1. Āvashyaka Sūtra 2. Daśavaikālika Sūtra 3. Uttarādhyayana Sūtra 4. Ācārāṅga Sūtra 5. Nishīthasūtra 6. Sūyagaḍāṅga Sūtra 7. Three Chhedasūtras (Daśāśruta Skandha Sūtra, Bṛhatkalpa Sūtra, Vyavahāra Sūtra) 8. Ṭhānāṅga Sūtra, Samavāyāṅga Sūtra 9. Bhagavati Sūtra
The remaining Kālika or Utkalika Sūtras should be studied or taught at any point in the middle or after this study order, as per the command of Gītartha Muni. This order should be understood as the Āgama system for memorizing the Āgama in its original and meaningful form.
Prāyaścitta for giving Vācanā to the ineligible and not giving it to the eligible
18. Je bhikṣū appaṭṭaṁ vāeī, vāeṁtaṁ vā sāijjī. 19. Je bhikṣū paṭṭaṁ ṇa vāeī, ṇa vāeṁtaṁ vā sāijjī. 20. Je bhikṣū avvaṭṭaṁ vāeī, vāeṁtaṁ vā sāijjī. 21. Je bhikṣū vaṭṭaṁ ṇa vāeī, ṇa vāeṁtaṁ vā sāijjī. 18. The bhikṣu who gives Vācanā to the ineligible (apaṭṭa) or approves of the one who gives it.
19. The bhikṣu who does not give Vācanā to the eligible (paṭṭa) or approves of the one who does not give it.
20. The bhikṣu who gives Vācanā to the unmanifested (avvaṭṭa) or approves of the one who gives it.
21. The bhikṣu who does not give Vācanā to the manifested (vaṭṭa) or approves of the one who does not give it. (He incurs the Laghuchauṁāsī prāyaścitta.)
Discussion - In the previous sūtras, the prāyaścitta for not giving Vācanā in order, of the sūtras, and of the study, uddeśaka, etc., has been stated. Because, by receiving the Vācanā of the Āgama-designated primary sūtra, study, uddeśaka, etc., one becomes eligible for the Vācanā of the subsequent sūtras, study, uddeśaka, etc. 

Page #523:
---------------------------
## Nineteenth Uddeshak ]
[ 423
Gradually, the merit also increases. Therefore, in those sutras, the subject of eligibility and ineligibility for recitation is also expected.
In the present four sutras, two types of eligibility are indicated by the words "Patra" and "Vyakt".
1. Patra - One who has attained full eligibility to receive the recitation of the Kalikasutras, i.e., one who possesses the qualities necessary for recitation, is called "Patra", and one who does not possess the qualities necessary for recitation is called "Apatra".
In the fourth Uddeshak of the Brihatkalpa Sutra, there is a provision for giving recitation to one who possesses three qualities, and a prohibition against giving recitation to one who possesses three demerits.
Three qualities
1. Vinita.
2. One who abandons the Vigaayas.
3.
Three demerits
1. Avinita
2. One who does not abandon Vigaayas.
3. One who does not pacify the Kashaya Klesha.
One who quickly pacifies the Kashaya Klesha.
Of these three qualities, the first, Vinaya, is very vast and is also called the root of Dharma. Nevertheless, at the very least, there should be complete faith, devotion, and dedication towards the reciter, there should be a respectful demeanor towards them, there should be complete interest and joy in receiving the recitation from them, and there should be the wisdom to study while holding their instructions as sacred. Such a Vinaya disciple is eligible for recitation.
Newly initiated disciples are first taught by the Pravartaka Muniraj about all the practices related to Samyama, respectful behavior, and general knowledge. The Stavira Munivers stabilize them with the qualities of Samyama. After this initial education, those who become eligible Patras, as described above, are appointed to study under the leadership of the Upadhyaya. Those who do not attain eligibility continue to increase their knowledge and meditation under the guidance of the Pravartaka and Stavira.
Under the Upadhyaya, the study of the original text is completed with pure pronunciation and Ghoshashuddhi, and the Acharya gives them the recitation of the Sutra-artha, which is full of meaning and ultimate meaning, according to their eligibility.
In the Vyavahar Bhashya Uddeshak 1, it is stated that it is necessary for each Gachchha to have five Padavidharas, of whom four are described above and the fifth is the Ganavachchedaka. These Ganavachchedakas are those who arrange all kinds of services, etc., related to the Gan, and are great assistants to the Acharya. With these five Padavidharas, the Gachchhavasis Sadhus can have a proper arrangement for the worship of knowledge, vision, character, etc. Therefore, the Bhashya encourages a Bhikshu who desires Samyama and Samadhi to stay in such a Gachchha, explaining it in detail with examples.
The following is a collection of verses from the Bhashya about the characteristics of an Apatra:

Titiṇie calacitte, gāṇangaṇie ya dubbal carite. Āyiriya paribhāsi, vāmavattē ya pisuṇē ya. 

Page #524:

##  Nishith Sutra 4.24

A monk who is attached to food, equipment, bed, and place, and who is eager for favorable benefits and complains when they are not received, who is fickle in his standing, sitting, speech, and thoughts, who changes his conduct without the reasons stated in the scriptures, who is slow in observing his vows, who speaks in front of teachers and those holding high positions, or those who have many jewels, thus showing disrespect, who acts contrary to their instructions and wishes, and who takes pleasure in slandering and gossiping about others to defeat them, is ineligible for the recitation of scriptures.

##  Further Explanation

Those who are arrogant, use abusive language, and are ungrateful are also considered ineligible.

The violation of the rules and prohibitions mentioned in the Brihatkalpa Uddesa 4 leads to atonement according to the first two sutras. This means that both the reciter who does not give the recitation to the eligible person and the reciter who gives the recitation to the ineligible person are subject to atonement.

Not giving the recitation to the eligible person leads to the decline of the scriptures, and giving the recitation to the ineligible person is a misuse of the scriptures. Therefore, it is essential to exercise discretion in both cases.

##  Interpretation of "Patta" and "Vyakt"

The first two sutras describe the "eligible" person in terms of their qualities, while the subsequent two sutras describe the "eligible" person in terms of their physical form.

The commentary explains that a monk is considered "vyakt" (eligible) when the hair on their body, including eyebrows and mustache, has grown. Alternatively, a monk is considered "vyakt" after the age of 16.

Such a "vyakt" monk is not given the recitation of the Kalika scriptures (Angasutra and Chhedasutra). The commentary explains that young monks lack the capacity to fully comprehend and retain the scriptures. The commentator uses the analogy of an unbaked pot to illustrate this point. Just as an unbaked pot is placed in fire to be hardened but not filled with water, young monks are nurtured through education and study but are not given the recitation of these scriptures until they are mature and eligible.

The word "patta" in these sutras has two meanings: "eligible" and "received." Similarly, "vyakt" has two meanings: "age-eligible" and "eligible by virtue of attaining the vows." A monk who is 16 years old is considered "age-eligible," while a monk who has received the vows for three years and is stable in his vows is considered "eligible by virtue of attaining the vows."

These alternative meanings are explained in the commentary. Due to these alternative meanings, or perhaps due to other received traditions, the number of sutras in these four sutras varies in different manuscripts. Some manuscripts have six sutras, while others have eight. In these manuscripts, the sutras "pattam - prapattam" are repeated twice or thrice, and the alternative meanings are linked to different sutras. 

Page #525:
---------------------------
## Nineteenth Udva Shak

[425] In reality, only four sutras are appropriate because repeating the same sutras again and again in the same chapter is not worthy of sutra composition.

From the perspective of meaning, the statement of qualifications like Vinaya etc. is included in the first pair of sutras, and the statement of qualifications like age etc. is included in the second pair of sutras. The statement of other topics like Praadi, which are obtained through the order of the sutras, has already been included in the previous sutras. Therefore, the texts with options of six or eight sutras have not been accepted here.

In this way, from sutra 16 to 21, three topics have been stated in pairs of two sutras: 1. Giving recitation in the order of the sutras, 2. Giving it only to those who are qualified by Vinaya, qualities etc., 3. Giving recitation only to those who are qualified and have attained the required age.  Penance is incurred for acting contrary to these regulations.

**Penance for showing partiality in giving recitation**

22. **Je bhikku doṇhaṁ sarisgaṇāṁ ekkāṁ sancikkhāveï, ekkāṁ na sancikkhāveï, ekkāṁ vāeï, ekkāṁ na vāeï, taṁ karantāṁ vā sāïjjai.**

A monk who teaches one of two equally qualified disciples and not the other, gives recitation to one and not the other, or approves of someone doing so (incurs the penance of Laghuchomaaso).

**Discussion:**  Disciples who possess the qualities of eligibility and individuality mentioned in the previous sutras, and who have the auspicious signs of correctly understanding the sutra, should be given recitation impartially and with equanimity.

In determining eligibility or ineligibility, besides discernment, there should also be an equal view of all disciples by the degree holders. If there is some prior or subsequent relationship with someone, there may be partiality due to attachment, or if there is an unpleasant relationship with someone, there may be aversion. But a Bahushruta who has attained the degree and the responsibility of teaching should not behave with such attachment or aversion. This is the meaning of this sutra.

Doing so increases discord among the disciples and unrest and disorder in the Gachchha. Therefore, the giver of recitation incurs the penance mentioned in the sutra. The Acharya or Ganavachchedak arranges for the giving of such penances.

**Penance for accepting recitation that has not been given**

23. **Je bhikku āïri-uvajjhāehiṁ avidiṇṇaṁ giraṁ āïyaï, āïyantāṁ vā sāïjjai.**

A monk who accepts recitation without it being given by the Acharya and Upadhyaya, or approves of someone doing so (incurs the penance of Laghuchomaaso).

**Discussion:**  Due to the established order, not giving recitation of a sutra etc., not giving recitation due to being ineligible to give it, not giving recitation due to lack of the required age, or showing partiality...

## Translation:

[426]
It is not appropriate for a monk to study the meaning of the sutras on their own if they have not received the recitation from a Nishīthasūtra practitioner or if there is no one in their lineage who is qualified to give the recitation. Similarly, it is not appropriate to accept the recitation if the Acharya or Upadhyaya has forbidden it. If, for some specific reason, the Acharya or Upadhyaya has forbidden the recitation of the original text or its meaning, then the recitation of the Agamas should be taken only after obtaining their permission. Until the permission of the Acharya or others is received, one should increase their tapas and restraint to attain qualification.

If the Acharya or others have forbidden it out of malice, then one should try to appease them through Vinaya or request it from other knowledgeable individuals in the lineage, such as the Gītartha Ganavacchedaka. However, one should not accept the scriptures through the prescribed method until permission is received. In both general and specific situations, accepting the scriptures without permission incurs the prāyaścitta mentioned in the sutras.

In the sutras, the word "gir" refers to the Jina's teachings, which are considered the Agamas. The mention of both Acharya and Upadhyaya is because both are involved in giving the recitation. The Upadhyaya gives the recitation of the original sutras, while the Acharya gives the recitation of the meaning and ultimate meaning of the sutras.

Currently, there are many lineages and many sects where there are no Acharyas or Upadhyayas, and even among those who exist, there are few who are knowledgeable in the scriptures and experts in the exceptions. Even they, being busy with social responsibilities, are unable to give regular recitations of the Agamas to qualified disciples. Therefore, it is beneficial for qualified disciples to obtain permission from their Gurudev and then recite, contemplate, and reflect on the Agamas. Because modern publications of the Agamas contain word meanings, meanings, and detailed discussions, studying those sutras on one's own can be particularly beneficial.

Therefore, one should recite the sutras with discernment, following the order of study, after obtaining permission from their Gurudev. Reciting on one's own after obtaining permission from the Gurudev does not incur the prāyaścitta for "unauthorised recitation" mentioned in the sutras, and one also benefits from familiarity with the scriptures and self-study.

The prāyaścitta for exchanging recitations with a householder is:

24. A monk who gives a recitation to another ascetic or a householder, or approves of someone giving a recitation, incurs a prāyaścitta.
25. A monk who accepts a recitation from another ascetic or a householder, or approves of someone accepting a recitation, incurs a prāyaścitta. [They receive the prāyaścitta of a small Caturmāsa.]

Discussion: Just as in the second Uddesaka, the words "householder" and "another ascetic" refer to "Bhiksācara householder" ...

The term "anyatothika" has been given a specific meaning, i.e., it refers to the atonement for going and coming with them in gochari etc. Similarly, in the present sutras, one should understand the atonement for the exchange of teachings with a householder and anyatothika who are imbued with mithyatva.
The commentator has explained that receiving teachings from them leads to condemnation in this way: "Their religion lacks scriptural knowledge, which is why they go to others to acquire knowledge.
And giving them teachings can lead them to create disputes, make inappropriate accusations, spread propaganda against the Jina dharma, distort many important topics, or further strengthen their mithyatva, and by narrating the practice of this exchange of teachings, they can make others mithyatvi.
The reasons stated in the commentary also make it clear that this prohibition is not for the samyagdrsti or the sramana-upasaka, but for the mithyadrsti.
The Nandisootra and Samavayanga Sutra mention the study of scriptures by sramana-upasakas and the practice of the upadhana [tapas] of the sutras, as follows:
Uvasagadassu nam uvasagaanam nagaraai jav posahovavvasa padivajjanayaao suy parighaha, tavovahanaa, padimao............
-Sam. A similar passage is found in the Nandisootra, and the Agamas also mention special qualities like bahushruta and kovida in Jinamat for the sramana-upasaka. They are included in the four tirthas and the four types of sramana sanghas, so this atonement should not be understood as applicable to the sramana-upasaka.
If a mithyadrsti is worthy of being approached for dharma, there is no fault in explaining and teaching him appropriate teachings or Agamic descriptions, but this task is suitable for a geetarth and a discerning bhikshu, otherwise, even making contact for the sake of acquaintance is considered an excess of samyaktva.
In the sramana class, if there is a lack of a teacher of teachings, or if it is necessary at times, it is not atonement-worthy to receive teachings from a bahushruta sramana-upasaka, because there is no reason for fault, and the Thananga Sutra states in the passage "Chauvehe samanasanghe" that the sramana-upasaka holds a very honorable position.
Therefore, understanding the meaning according to the context, one should understand here the atonement for the exchange of teachings with a householder imbued with mithyatva, etc. Atonement for the exchange of teachings with a parshvastha

Discussion: Just as the previous *sūtra* mentioned the possibility of faults in giving and receiving *vācana* from a *mithyātvī* householder, so too should one understand it with regard to *pārśvastha* etc. However, here, instead of *mithyātvā*, one should understand the fault of nurturing and modeling lax conduct. In previous *uddeśas*, *prāyaścitta* has been mentioned for contact with these individuals in terms of *vandana*, *āhāra*, *śayyā*, etc. Therefore, one should understand the specific discussion and faults from *uddeśaka* 4, 10, and 13. If a *gītartha* *muni* ever gives a *vācana* to a *pārśvastha* etc. with the hope that they will improve in *samyama*, then one should not consider it a *prāyaścitta*.

Discussion: These fourteen sūtras describe the various options for giving *prāyaścitta* to a critic, according to the criticism, after he has observed the faults mentioned in the nineteen *uddeśakas* (topics).
A critic may criticize *prāyaścitta* places by observing them once or many times, and may also criticize many *prāyaścitta* places once or many times, either together or separately.
Some critics are sincere and make truthful criticisms, while others are deceitful. Therefore, the method of giving *prāyaścitta* to such critics is described here.

## The Twentieth Uddeshak

[435]

The nineteenth Uddeshak discusses four types of Prāyaścitta: Māsika, Chaumāsi, and their Guru or Laghu. However, some specific Doshas have Prāyaścitta with an increase of five days or ten days. Therefore, in Sutra 13-14, there is a mention of four months or four months plus, five months or five months plus. However, there is no independent instruction in the Praagamas for Panchamaasi or Chhamaasi Prāyaścitta places, similar to the Chaumāsi Prāyaścitta places. Only a hint of them is found in this Uddeshak.

If one performs Prāyaścitta at any of these places once or multiple times and then criticizes oneself, the Prāyaścitta place remains the same, but the intensity of the penance decreases.

If there are multiple Prāyaścitta places, then Prāyaścitta is obtained for all those places, and penance is performed according to the intensity of each Prāyaścitta place.

If one criticizes oneself with a simple mind, Prāyaścitta is obtained according to the Prāyaścitta place. If one criticizes with deceit, then upon knowing the deceit, one month more Prāyaścitta is added to that Prāyaścitta place, meaning a Guru month of Prāyaścitta is added for the deceit.

From the ninth to the fourteenth Purva, the Shrutagyani, Avadhigyani, Manahparyavagyani, and Kevalgyani, these Aagamavihāri Bhikshus, know the deceit of the critic through their knowledge. Therefore, one should criticize and perform Prāyaścitta only in their presence. In their absence, a Shrutavyavahari Sadhu can understand the deceit through language and expressions after listening to the criticism three times, as they are also experienced in the meaning of the scriptures.

If the deceit of the one who criticizes with deceit is not known, then their purification does not happen. Therefore, the Aagamas mention the qualifications of the one who criticizes and the one who listens, and there are other descriptions related to criticism. For example:

1. In Thaanaang A. 10, it is said that the one who criticizes must have ten qualities. These are:
    1. Jaatisampanna (born into a good family)
    2. Kulasampanna (from a good lineage)
    3. Vinayasampanna (well-mannered)
    4. Gyanasampanna (knowledgeable)
    5. Darshanasampanna (possessing right vision)
    6. Charitrasampanna (of good character)
    7. Kshamavan (forgiving)
    8. Damneendriya (having controlled senses)
    9. Amaayi (not deceitful)
    10. Not regretting after criticizing.

2. In Thaanaang A. 10, the ten qualities of the one who listens to the criticism are mentioned as follows:
    1. Praachaaravan (following the right conduct)
    2. Able to understand all faults
    3. Knower of the order of the five Vyavaharas
    4. Skilled in removing hesitation
    5. Able to make someone criticize
    6. Not revealing the criticism to anyone
    7. Giver of appropriate Prāyaścitta
    8. Able to explain the negative consequences of not criticizing or criticizing with deceit
    9. Priyadharmmi (devoted to Dharma)
    10. Dridhadharmmi (firm in Dharma)

In Uttara A. 36 Ga. 262, three qualities of the one who listens to the criticism are mentioned:
    1. Expert in the Aagamas
    2. Able to generate Samadhi
    3. Gunagrahi (one who accepts good qualities)

##  [436]
[Nishīthasūtra
3. Ṭhāṇāṅga a. 10 mentions 10 faults in criticism as follows: 1. Criticizing after pleasing someone with service etc. 2. Criticizing by pleading for less penance etc. 3. Criticizing faults seen by others. 4. Criticizing major faults. 5. Criticizing minor faults. 6. Speaking very unclearly. 7. Speaking very loudly. 8. Criticizing the same fault to many people. 9. Criticizing someone who is not receptive. 10. Criticizing someone who indulges in the same faults.
Criticism is pure only when the above points are considered with proper discernment. If the listener is not worthy, then criticism can be given to a member of the same <i>gaccha</i>, another <i>gaccha</i>, or a <i>śrāvaka</i>, etc. in sequence. Finally, the provision for criticizing with the witness of Arhats and Siddhas is also mentioned in Vyavahāra U. 1.
Ṭhāṇāṅga a. 3 states that criticism and penance are performed for the pure worship of knowledge, vision, and conduct. One who does not criticize and perform penance for their faults spoils both this world and the next, becomes a hypocrite, and makes the soul a participant in lower realms.
Among the many reasons for not criticizing, the main reason is the fear of humiliation and disgrace. But this is a state of ignorance. Because one who becomes pure by criticizing attains complete samadhi in this life and the next, while one who does not criticize becomes inwardly distressed in this life and attains non-samadhi in both worlds. By not criticizing, one becomes a long-lived being due to a painful death.
If a monk hides faults committed once or many times in the fundamental virtues or the secondary virtues, does not criticize the committed faults, and does not perform penance, then the accountant should question him about the committed faults.
If he speaks falsely and claims to be innocent, then someone should be appointed to observe him committing the fault and, with proof, the fault should be proven in front of him and penance should be given.
There is no provision for penance for such a deceitful person in the nineteen <i>uddeśakas</i>. These only contain provisions for penance for those who criticize voluntarily. If the aforementioned deceitful monk does not readily accept the committed faults, he should be expelled from the <i>gaccha</i>.
If he readily accepts the committed faults and the <i>gaccha</i> leader is convinced of his sincerity, then he can be kept in the <i>gaccha</i> after giving him the following penance:
1. If he has not committed the fault many times, and has not spoken falsely many times, and has not...

## Twentieth Uddeshak

[437 If the fault is not concealed and the knowledge of its transgression is not known to the public, then the penance of Chhed Diksha should be given.
2. If he has repeatedly violated the great vows like Brahmacharya, repeatedly spoken Maya-Msha speech, and the knowledge of his repeated violation of Brahmacharya etc. has become known to the public, then he should be given the penance of Mula, i.e., new Diksha.
In Uttaradhyayanasutra, Chapter 29, criticism, condemnation, and reproach are said to be extremely auspicious and excellent fruits of faults.
In Thananga, Chapter 10, Bhagavati Sutra, Chapter 25, Uddeshak 7, Upadesha Sutra, Chapter 30, and Uttaradhyayanasutra, Chapter 30, ten types of penances are mentioned, among which criticism is said to be the first place of penance.
Penance is performed for the transgression of faults, either in the original qualities of Charitra or in the subsequent qualities.
In Nishisthasutra, four main divisions of penance are mentioned, and in the commentary, while explaining it in detail, penance from five days to six months, and Chhed Mula Ananvasthapya and Paranchik penance are mentioned.
According to the feelings of transgression, the penance for the same fault-place is increased or decreased.
In Bhagavati Sutra, Chapter 25, Uddeshak 7, and Thananga, Chapter 10, ten types of transgression are mentioned. They are:
1. Due to pride (power and audacity), 2. Due to laziness, 3. Due to carelessness, 4. Due to eagerness for hunger, thirst, etc., 5. When there is a crisis, 6. Due to narrowness of field, etc., 7. Due to mistake, 8. Due to fear, 9. Due to anger or hatred, 10. For the sake of testing the disciple, etc.
Behind every transgression, there is one or more of these reasons.
Out of these reasons, some faults can be purified only by criticism, some by criticism and Pratikraman, and some by penance, Chhed, etc.
After transgression, the seeker of self-purification performs penance by criticism. Just as dirt on clothes is purified by washing, similarly, the faults (in restraint, etc.) of the soul are purified by penance.
In Uttaradhyayanasutra, Chapter 29, it is said that by performing penance, faults are purified, character becomes unblemished, and the one who accepts the right penance becomes a devotee of the path of liberation and conduct.
Ten types of penance:
1. For those who are worthy of criticism - only criticism is sufficient for purification of exceptional behavior, tendency, etc., due to field, etc.
2. For those who are worthy of Pratikraman - only Pratikraman (Micchami Dukkadam) is sufficient for purification of Ayatana due to carelessness.

1. **Tadu-bhaya Yoga-Tap Praayaschitta** (Praayaschitta for both Yoga and Tap): Very minor offenses, such as those related to the Samiti (assembly), are purified through Alochana (reflection) and Pratikramana (confession).
2. **Viveka Yoga-Tap Praayaschitta** (Praayaschitta for Viveka Yoga and Tap): When a mistake is made in accepting food or drink that is either defective or inappropriate, or when the rules regarding the time and place of eating are violated, the appropriate Praayaschitta is to give up the food or drink.
3. **Vyutsarga Yoga-Tap Praayaschitta** (Praayaschitta for Vyutsarga Yoga and Tap): When a simple mistake is made, the Praayaschitta is to perform the prescribed number of breaths of Kayotsarga (body purification). This is also the fifth requirement in the Ubha-Kala Pratikramana. All five of these Praayaschittas are free from Tap.
4. **Tap Yoga-Tap Praayaschitta** (Praayaschitta for Tap Yoga and Tap): When a fault is committed in the Mula Guna (primary qualities) or Uttara Guna (secondary qualities), the Praayaschitta ranges from Puri-madd (one-day fast) to a six-month Tap. This is of two types:
    a. **Shuddha Tap** (Pure Tap)
    b. **Parihar Tap** (Avoidance Tap)
5. **Chheda Yoga-Tap Praayaschitta** (Praayaschitta for Chheda Yoga and Tap): When offenses are repeatedly committed, when criticism is made without reason, or when there is excessive public censure, the Praayaschitta is to undergo a Chheda (suspension) of the Diksha (initiation) for a period ranging from one day to six months.
6. **Mula Yoga-Tap Praayaschitta** (Praayaschitta for Mula Yoga and Tap): When offenses that are eligible for Chheda are committed due to negligence or self-indulgence, the Praayaschitta is to undergo a complete Chheda of the Diksha and receive a new initiation.
7. **An-avasthapya Paranchika Praayaschitta** (Praayaschitta for An-avasthapya Paranchika): These two Praayaschittas are considered to be distinct in the present time. Before receiving a new initiation, the individual undergoes rigorous Tap-filled practices, is kept separate from the group for a period of time, and then is given a new initiation after being dressed as a householder. There are differences in the specific Tap, its duration, and other aspects. For further details, refer to Brihatkalpa Uddeshak 4 and Vyavahar Uddeshak 2.

These sutras describe the Praayaschittas involving the Laghu-masik (short-term) and other Taps. The Bhashya Gatha 6499 states that the Praayaschittas mentioned in the 19 Uddeshakas are for violations of Jnana (knowledge), Darshan (vision), and Charitra (conduct). These Praayaschittas are applicable to the Sthavirakalpi (those who have attained the highest stage of spiritual development) only when they commit an An-achar (major offense), while the Jinakalpi (those who are still on the path of spiritual development) receive these Praayaschittas for all four types of violations: Atikrama, Vyatikrama, Atichar, and An-achar.

1. **Atikrama**: The intention to commit an offense.
2. **Vyatikrama**: The beginning of preparation to commit an offense.
3. **Atichar**: The near completion of the tendency to commit an offense.
4. **An-achar**: The actual commission of the offense.

For example:
1. **Atikrama**: The intention to eat food that is prohibited.
2. **Vyatikrama**: Going to obtain the prohibited food.
3. **Atichar**: Bringing the prohibited food and keeping it ready.
4. **An-achar**: Eating the prohibited food.

The Sthavirakalpi receive the five Praayaschittas from Atikrama to Vyutsarga, while the Jinakalpi receive one of the five remaining Praayaschittas when they commit an An-achar.

[439 The description of Parihar Tap and Shuddha Tap, who they are given to, is in the Bhashya Gatha 6586 to 91. There it is also said that Shuddha Tap Prāyaścitta is given only to Sadhvi and the Agiatartha, Durbal and the Bhikshu who has completed three Santhyanas.
To the one who has taken Diksha for 20 years, to the one who is above 29 years of age, to the one who is Utkrishta Gittarth, i.e., who has attained the knowledge of 9 Purvas, to the one who has completed the first Santhan, and to the one who practices many Abhigha Tap Sadhana, Parihar Tap is given. The complete method of giving Parihar Tap is described in Bhashya Gatha 6592.
From Sutra 1 to 5, the general Prāyaścitta is said to be the consumption of one-month Prāyaścitta Sthana to five-month Prāyaścitta Sthana once, and from Sutra 6 to 10, the consumption of many times. Along with this, it is said to give a special Guru-mas Prāyaścitta for deceitful criticism.
From Sutra 11 to 14, information is given about many Sutras with Dwisanayogi etc. Bhang, from the consumption of many of these Prāyaścitta Sthana. In the Bhashya Chuni, the count of crores of Sutras is mentioned in detail.
In Sutras 5, 10 and 11 to 14, the phrase "Teṇ Param-Paliuñciya Apaliuñciya Te Chev Chhammasa" is present. Its meaning should be understood as - if someone is eligible for a 6-month or 7-month Prāyaścitta, or if they are criticizing with or without deceit, then also this six-month Prāyaścitta is applicable, not more than that.
Subahuhi Vi Masehi, Chhanham Masana Param Na Dayavvam || 6524 ||
Chuni - Tawarihehi Bahuhi Masehi Chhammasa Param Na Dijjai, Savvassev Es Niyamo, Ettha Karanam Jamha Amham Vaddhamana Samino Evam Chev Param Pamanam Thavitam.
Meaning - In the reign of Vardhaman Mahavira Swami, only this much Prāyaścitta is prescribed, and this rule is for all Sadhu-Sadhvi.
_ Agiatartha, Atiparinama, Aparinama Sadhu-Sadhvi are given only 6 months of Tap, not Chhed Prāyaścitta. But if they repeatedly commit the fault, or if they commit violence against the five senses with Akutti Buddhi, i.e., with the intention of killing, or if they consume Kushila with pride, then they can be given Chhed Prāyaścitta. And those who are indifferent to Chhed are given "Mula Prāyaścitta".
If someone commits other small or big faults, they are not given Chhed or Mula Prāyaścitta for the first time, but if they are warned once that "O Arya! If you commit this fault repeatedly, then Chhed or Mula Prāyaścitta will be given", then they can be given Chhed or Mula Prāyaścitta. The one who has not been warned cannot be given Chhed or Mula Prāyaścitta. In the Bhashya, the Sadhu who has been warned is called "Vikovit" and the Sadhu who has not been warned is called "Avikovit". Vikovit is given Lagghu for the first time, Guru for the second time and Chhed Prāyaścitta for the third time.

## Nishīthasūtra 
**Chapter 440**

The **Chheda Prāyaścitta** is also excellent for six months and can be given up to three times. After that, the **Mūla Prāyaścitta** is given.

**As** if a **Puṇo** arises during the six months, then the **Chheda** should be given for three times. This is an **Aviseṭṭa** or three times **Challahu Chheda**.

**Or** - If the **Tava** is **Teya** then the **Chheda** is given - within a month, within four months, within six months, and from there, different months up to six months, in those **Chhinna** (broken) **Chheda** **Teya** becomes **Atikka** (excessive). Then, if it arises again, the **Mūla** is given for three times. - **Cūrṇi Bhā. 4 p. 351-52**

From this, it is clear that during the reign of **Vardhamāna Mahāvīra Svāmī**, there is no provision for giving **Tap** and **Chheda Prāyaścitta** for more than six months. Therefore, no **Doṣa** should be given more than six months of **Tap** or **Chheda**. Because giving more **Prāyaścitta** would be contrary to this **Sūtrāṁśa** and the **Bhāṣyōkta Paramparā**. The **Mūla** (new **Dīkṣā**) **Prāyaścitta** can also be given three times, and the six months of **Tap** and six months of **Chheda** can also be given only three times. After that, further **Prāyaścitta** is given. Finally, the person is expelled from the **Gaccha**.

Here, the bearing of prāyaścitta is first called 'sthāpana', and the prāyaścitta given during that period of bearing is called 'prasthāpana'. It is said that the prāyaścitta for the transgressions committed during the prasthāpana period should also be combined with it. Thus, the combination of prāyaścitta is mentioned in these sūtras.
In the first sūtra, the establishment of prāyaścitta is for the transgression committed once, without deception, and in the second sūtra, it is for the transgression committed with deception. In the next two sūtras, the establishment of prāyaścitta is for the transgression committed...

## Twentieth Uddeshak

[445]

Criticism, both deceitful and non-deceitful, has been discussed many times. Regarding the criticism of faults committed during the performance of Prāyaścitta, four types of breaches have been mentioned. Regardless of the type of criticism, the Prāyaścitta encompasses all of them.

These sutras also instruct on the possibility of the Prāyaścitta performer becoming dependent during the Prāyaścitta period. This means that if service is necessary during that period, it is performed. The Prāyaścitta performer does not have service done for them until they are able to perform their own duties. This method of performing Prāyaścitta is mentioned in relation to Parihāra Tapa. For further details, refer to the fourth Uddeshak.

One who performs Prāyaścitta in the form of pure Tapa can complete the fasts, etc., received during the Prāyaścitta, at any time within the period specified by the Prāyaścitta giver. They also complete the Prāyaścitta in the same way if they are criticized again for the same faults.

The method of performing Prāyaścitta through pure Tapa in the Prāyaścitta places of Laghu Māsik, Guru Māsik, Laghu Chaumāsi, Guru Chaumāsi, Laghu Chha: Māsi, and Guru Chha: Māsi is given in the table before the first Uddeshak. All divisions of Prāyaścitta should be understood according to that.

It should be understood that the descriptions in these sutras of the twentieth Uddeshak and all subsequent sutras pertain to Parihāra Tapa Prāyaścitta. This description, or any other descriptions found in the Chhedasutras, do not imply its discontinuation. However, commentators explain this Parihāra Tapa Prāyaścitta as being for Āgamavihārīs, and thus, indicate its discontinuation in the present time.

Therefore, this tradition of Prāyaścitta is not current.

**Establishment of Two-Month Prāyaścitta**

If a six-month Parihāra Daana is prescribed, and within that, a two-month Parihāra is performed, then the criticism, the number of days, the twenty-day period of Ārovaṇa, the beginning, middle, and end, all should be included, and the reason should be stated. It is not diminished, and therefore, it becomes twenty-seven days of two months.

Twentieth Uddeshak]
If one criticizes, then the atonement of twenty nights is prescribed for him, neither less nor more. After that, if he commits the fault again, then the atonement of two months and twenty nights is prescribed.
Again,
Discussion - In these sutras, the method of giving the atonement of the two months atonement place form fault, with grace and without grace, is stated while bearing any atonement from one month to six months.
If a fault is committed for the first time during the period of bearing atonement, then it is given with grace and a lesser atonement is given. That is called the gracious atonement. Again, if the same fault is committed, then full atonement is given without grace. That is called the ungracious atonement.
The meaning of these sutras is that if atonement is given again before the gracious atonement is imposed during the period of bearing atonement, then it is ungracious.
The gracious twenty days and the ungracious two months atonement, before the gracious atonement is combined with the atonement being borne, are combined and stated in the sutra as two months and twenty days.
Method of calculating the number of days of gracious atonement
By adding two to the number of months of the atonement place and multiplying by five, the number of days of atonement is obtained. For example, by adding two to two months, it becomes four, and multiplying it by five, it becomes twenty. Thus, the gracious days for two months are twenty. Alternatively, one should understand the gracious atonement days as fifteen days for one month, twenty days for two months, twenty-five days for three months, etc.
In Thananga Sutra A. 5, five types of atonement are stated:
1. Prasthapita - Atonement that is added to the days of other atonement while bearing atonement.
2. Sthapita - Atonement that is kept separate from the days of other atonement while being borne.
3. Kritsna - Ungracious atonement that is given for the entire days of the atonement place of the fault committed during the period of bearing.
4. Akritsna - Gracious atonement that is given by reducing the days of the atonement place of the fault committed during the period of bearing.
5. Hadhada - Atonement that is to be borne immediately.
In these sutras, the subject related to four types of atonement is stated together.

Two Months Penance, Its Establishment, Imposition and Increase
25. An ānāgāra who is performing a two-month penance, if he commits a two-month penance-worthy offense during the beginning, middle, or end of the penance, due to a purpose, reason, or cause, and is criticized for it, then he should perform a twenty-night prāropaṇā penance, neither less nor more. When combined, this results in a three-month and ten-night prastāpanā.
26. An ānāgāra who is performing a three-month and ten-night penance, if he commits a two-month penance-worthy offense during the beginning, middle, or end of the penance, due to a purpose, reason, or cause, and is criticized for it, then he should perform a twenty-night prāropaṇā penance, neither less nor more. When combined, this results in a four-month prastāpanā.
27. An ānāgāra who is performing a four-month penance, if he commits a two-month penance-worthy offense during the beginning, middle, or end of the penance, due to a purpose, reason, or cause, and is criticized for it, then he should perform a twenty-night prāropaṇā penance, neither less nor more. When combined, this results in a four-month and twenty-night prastāpanā.

An ānāgāra who is performing a four-month and twenty-night penance, if he commits a two-month penance-worthy offense during the beginning, middle, or end of the penance, due to a purpose, reason, or cause, and is criticized for it, then he should perform a twenty-night prāropaṇā penance, neither less nor more. When combined, this results in a five-month prastāpanā.
29. An ānāgāra who is performing a five-month penance, if he commits a two-month penance-worthy offense during the beginning, middle, or end of the penance, due to a purpose, reason, or cause, and is criticized for it, then he should perform a twenty-night prāropaṇā penance, neither less nor more. When combined, this results in a six-month prastāpanā.

## Twentieth Uddeshak

[449] If an Anugara, while undergoing a two-month penance, commits a two-month penance-worthy offense due to purpose, motive, or cause, at the beginning, middle, or end of the penance period, then he incurs a penance of twenty nights of Aropaṇa, neither less nor more. Combining this with the previous penance, it becomes a penance of five months and ten nights of Prasthāpanā.

[29] If an Anugara, while undergoing a penance of five months and ten nights, commits a two-month penance-worthy offense due to purpose, motive, or cause, at the beginning, middle, or end of the penance period, then he incurs a penance of twenty nights of Aropaṇa, neither less nor more. Combining this with the previous penance, it becomes a penance of six months.

**Discussion:**

In the previous sutras, the establishment of a two-month penance place within the penance period was called Aropaṇa. The same is mentioned in these sutras as a separate method of carrying out the penance after it has been completed. The method of increasing Prasthāpanā-Aropaṇa is explained in a sequential manner.

This describes the consumption of a two-month penance place again while carrying out the previously obtained two-month penance, and its Anugraha Aropaṇa.

These sutras state that Anugraha Aropaṇa can occur repeatedly in the penance given sequentially through Prasthāpanā. However, it was stated in the previous six sutras that Anugraha Aropaṇa occurs only once in the established Aropaṇa penance.

The word "Teṇa Param" in the fifth, tenth, nineteenth, etc. sutras of this Uddeshak naturally has a contextually relevant meaning. However, it is not contextually relevant to interpret the word "Teṇa Param" directly in these sutras because this is Prasthāpitā Aropaṇa, and the penance days are added sequentially, totaling six months.

The Churnikara also explained the same, stating that the penance before and after is added sequentially here. Therefore, it is necessary to interpret the word "Teṇa Param" in these sutras as "combining which".

Perhaps, due to a scribal error, the text in these sutras became similar to the previous sutras, while its original form may have indicated the meaning mentioned above. Because the Churnikara has also interpreted this section in the same way.

**One-month penance and established Aropaṇa**

[30] If an Anugara, while undergoing a six-month penance, consumes a one-month penance place due to purpose, motive, or cause, at the beginning, middle, or end of the penance period, then he incurs a penance of one month of Aropaṇa, neither less nor more. Combining this with the previous penance, it becomes a penance of seven months.

[31] If an Anugara, while undergoing a five-month penance, consumes a one-month penance place due to purpose, motive, or cause, at the beginning, middle, or end of the penance period, then he incurs a penance of one month of Aropaṇa, neither less nor more. Combining this with the previous penance, it becomes a penance of six months.

34. If an Anugara, undertaking a two-month *prāyaścitta*, consumes a *māsika prāyaścitta* worthy offense due to purpose, motive, or reason at the beginning, middle, or end of the *prāyaścitta* period, he incurs a *prāyaścitta* of one *pakṣa* of *prāropaṇā*, neither less nor more. If he consumes the offense again, he incurs a *prāyaścitta* of one and a half months.

35. If an Anugara, undertaking a *māsika prāyaścitta*, consumes a one-month *prāyaścitta* worthy offense due to purpose, motive, or reason at the beginning, middle, or end of the *prāyaścitta* period, he incurs a *prāyaścitta* of one *pakṣa* of *prāropaṇā*, neither less nor more. If he consumes the offense again, he incurs a *prāyaścitta* of one and a half months.

**Discussion:** This should be understood in the same way as Sutra 19-24. The difference is that there, the statement is about the establishment of *prāropaṇā* for a *prāyaścitta* of two months in the middle of the *prāyaścitta* period, while here, the statement is about the establishment of *prāropaṇā* for a *prāyaścitta* of one month in the middle of the *prāyaścitta* period.

**Establishment of *prāropaṇā* and Increase for a One-Month *Prāyaścitta***

36. If an Anugara, undertaking a *prāyaścitta* of one *divada-māsa*, consumes a *prāyaścitta* worthy offense due to purpose, motive, or reason at the beginning, middle, or end of the *prāyaścitta* period, he incurs a *prāyaścitta* of two months.

37. If an Anugara, undertaking a *prāyaścitta* of two months, consumes a *prāyaścitta* worthy offense due to purpose, motive, or reason at the beginning, middle, or end of the *prāyaścitta* period, he incurs a *prāyaścitta* of one and a half months.

38. If an Anugara, undertaking a *prāyaścitta* of one and a half months, consumes a *prāyaścitta* worthy offense due to purpose, motive, or reason at the beginning, middle, or end of the *prāyaścitta* period, he incurs a *prāyaścitta* of three months.

39. If an Anugara, undertaking a *prāyaścitta* of three months, consumes a *prāyaścitta* worthy offense due to purpose, motive, or reason at the beginning, middle, or end of the *prāyaścitta* period, he incurs a *prāyaścitta* of four months.

40. If an Anugara, undertaking a *prāyaścitta* of four months, consumes a *prāyaścitta* worthy offense due to purpose, motive, or reason at the beginning, middle, or end of the *prāyaścitta* period, he incurs a *prāyaścitta* of four and a half months.

41. If an Anugara, undertaking a *prāyaścitta* of four and a half months, consumes a *prāyaścitta* worthy offense due to purpose, motive, or reason at the beginning, middle, or end of the *prāyaścitta* period, he incurs a *prāyaścitta* of five months.

[Nishith Sutra]
If an Aṇagāra, while performing the Āloka-Ajja-Ahavāra Pakkhiya Ārovana, commits a monthly penance-worthy offense due to a purpose, reason, or cause at the beginning, middle, or end of the penance period, then he shall perform the penance of one Pakkhiya Ārovana, neither less nor more. This, when combined, results in a penance of two months.
42. If an Aṇagāra, while performing the penance of two months, commits a monthly penance-worthy offense due to a purpose, reason, or cause at the beginning, middle, or end of the penance period, then he shall perform the penance of one Pakkhiya Ārovana, neither less nor more. This, when combined, results in a penance of two and a half months.
43. If an Aṇagāra, while performing the penance of two and a half months, commits a monthly penance-worthy offense due to a purpose, reason, or cause at the beginning, middle, or end of the penance period, then he shall perform the penance of one Pakkhiya Ārovana, neither less nor more. This, when combined, results in a penance of three months.
44. If an Aṇagāra, while performing the penance of three months, commits a monthly penance-worthy offense due to a purpose, reason, or cause at the beginning, middle, or end of the penance period, then he shall perform the penance of one Pakkhiya Ārovana, neither less nor more. This, when combined, results in a penance of three and a half months.
36. If an Aṇagāra, while performing the penance of three and a half months, commits a monthly penance-worthy offense due to a purpose, reason, or cause at the beginning, middle, or end of the penance period, then he shall perform the penance of one Pakkhiya Ārovana, neither less nor more. This, when combined, results in a penance of four months.

41. An Anugara who is performing a four-month penance, if he commits a monthly penance-worthy offense due to purpose, motive, or reason at the beginning, middle, or end of the penance period, and is criticized for it, then he incurs a penance of one paksha of Aroopana. Combining this with the original penance, it becomes a penance of four and a half months.

42. An Anugara who is performing a four and a half month penance, if he commits a monthly penance-worthy offense due to purpose, motive, or reason at the beginning, middle, or end of the penance period, and is criticized for it, then he incurs a penance of one paksha of Aroopana. Combining this with the original penance, it becomes a penance of five months.

43. An Anugara who is performing a five-month penance, if he commits a monthly penance-worthy offense due to purpose, motive, or reason at the beginning, middle, or end of the penance period, and is criticized for it, then he incurs a penance of one paksha of Aroopana. Combining this with the original penance, it becomes a penance of five and a half months.

44. An Anugara who is performing a five and a half month penance, if he commits a monthly penance-worthy offense due to purpose, motive, or reason at the beginning, middle, or end of the penance period, and is criticized for it, then he incurs a penance of one paksha of Aroopana. Combining this with the original penance, it becomes a penance of six months.

**Discussion:**

This should be understood in the same way as Sutras 25 to 29. The only difference is that instead of the Aroopana being a replacement for the two-month penance, here it should be understood as a replacement for the one-month penance.

**Increase and Aroopana of Monthly and Two-Monthly Penances**

45. If an Anugara who is performing a two-month Pariharatthana commits a monthly Pariharatthana offense due to purpose, motive, or reason at the beginning, middle, or end of the penance period, and is criticized for it, then he incurs a penance of one paksha of Aroopana. Combining this with the original penance, it becomes a penance of two and a half months.

46. If an Anugara who is performing a two and a half month Pariharatthana commits a two-month Pariharatthana offense due to purpose, motive, or reason at the beginning, middle, or end of the penance period, and is criticized for it, then he incurs a penance of twenty-one days of Aroopana. Combining this with the original penance, it becomes a penance of three months.

47. If an Anugara who is performing a three-month Pariharatthana commits a monthly Pariharatthana offense due to purpose, motive, or reason at the beginning, middle, or end of the penance period, and is criticized for it, then he incurs a penance of one paksha of Aroopana. Combining this with the original penance, it becomes a penance of three and a half months.

48. If an Anugara who is performing a three and a half month Pariharatthana commits a two-month Pariharatthana offense due to purpose, motive, or reason at the beginning, middle, or end of the penance period, and is criticized for it, then he incurs a penance of twenty-one days of Aroopana. Combining this with the original penance, it becomes a penance of four months.

Twentieth Uddeshak]
50. An Anugara who is undergoing a five-night less Prāyaścitta for five months, if he criticizes a two-month Prāyaścitta-worthy fault due to purpose, motive or reason at the beginning, middle or end of the Prāyaścitta period, then he incurs a Prāyaścitta of twenty nights, neither less nor more. This, when combined, results in a five-and-a-half-month Pratiṣṭhāpana.
51. An Anugara who is undergoing a five-and-a-half-month Prāyaścitta, if he criticizes a one-month Prāyaścitta-worthy fault due to purpose, motive or reason at the beginning, middle or end of the Prāyaścitta period, then he incurs a Prāyaścitta of one Pakṣa, neither less nor more. This, when combined, results in a six-month Pratiṣṭhāpana.
Discussion- In these sūtras, the combined Pratiṣṭhāpana of monthly and two-monthly Prāyaścitta places is called Āropaṇa. The rest of the discussion should be understood as in the previous sūtras.
Similar to one month and two months, other multiple-month related Pratiṣṭhāpana, Āropaṇa, etc. alternatives should also be understood accordingly. The summary sūtra 1-5 of the twentieth Uddeshak states that for a Prāyaścitta place from one month to five months, the Prāyaścitta for criticizing it without deceit is the same number of months. For criticizing with deceit, a Prāyaścitta of one Guru month is incurred. For a Prāyaścitta place of six months or more, the Prāyaścitta is only six months, whether criticized with or without deceit. There is no further Prāyaścitta provision, just as there is no jail sentence of more than 20 years in the state system. 6-10 The Prāyaścitta for criticizing a Prāyaścitta place consumed multiple times should be understood as in the previous sūtras. 11-12 The Prāyaścitta for criticizing monthly, etc. Prāyaścitta places with dual-combination breaches should also be understood as in the previous sūtras. 13-14 The Prāyaścitta for criticizing full-month or more-than-full-month places, with or without deceit, etc. should be understood as in the previous sūtra. When a fault place consumed once is criticized without deceit, and the fault is applied again, then Āropaṇa of Prāyaścitta is done for any breach of the two four-fold breaches. The Prāyaścitta for criticizing a place consumed once with deceit, and the Āropaṇa in it, should be understood as in the previous sūtras. 17-18 The entire description related to the place consumed multiple times should be understood as in these two sūtras, similar to the previous two sūtras.

## Nishīyasūtra 19-24

For a period of atonement lasting from one to six months, for the first two months, the *sānugṛaha sthāpitā āropaṇā* is twenty days, and then for the next two months, the *niranugraha sthāpitā āropaṇā* is two months, and a total of two months and twenty days of *sthāpitā pāropaṇā* is given. 25-29

While undergoing the atonement of two months and twenty days of *sthāpitā āropaṇā*, the *prasthāpitā āropaṇā* of twenty days for each two months of atonement is increased, and this *āropaṇā* is done up to six months. 30-35

The *sānugṛaha* and *niranugraha sthāpitā āropaṇā* are to be known as in sūtra 19-24, but instead of the two-month atonement period, one month and twenty days should be understood, and instead of twenty days of *āropaṇā*, fifteen days should be understood, and instead of two months and twenty days, one and a half months should be understood. 36-44

The *prasthāpitā āropaṇā* is to be known as in sūtra 25-29, but here, instead of two months and twenty days, there is a *prasthāpana* of one and a half months, and instead of twenty days of *āropaṇā*, there is an increase of fifteen days of *āropaṇā* for the one-month atonement period, and this *āropaṇā* should be understood as extending up to six months. 45-51

When a fault is committed while undergoing the atonement of two months, an increase of fifteen days of *āropaṇā* is given for the one-month period. Subsequently, an increase of twenty days of *āropaṇā* is given for the two-month period. In this way, the *prasthāpitā āropaṇā* should be understood as increasing from both periods up to six months.

Thus, in this *uddeśaka*, the giving of atonement for the criticism of atonement periods, and the *sānugṛaha*, *niranugraha*, *sthāpitā*, and *prasthāpitā āropaṇā* during the period of atonement are clearly stated.

**Conclusion:**

In the four divisions of atonement periods, such as *laghumāsika*, etc., the faults that are mentioned should be understood to be similar to other unmentioned faults. Due to factors such as the nature of the fault, the ability of the one receiving atonement, etc., there are many alternatives for the pure austerities, etc., that are given in these periods, which should be understood from the guidance of the *gītartha muni* or from tradition, and an attempt should also be made to understand them from the atonement table given earlier in the first *uddeśaka*.

To understand the atonement method with its detailed alternatives, one should study the *niśītha pīṭhikā* and the commentary of the twentieth *uddeśaka*, or one should study the *bṛhatkalpasūtra*, *vyavahārasūtra*, and *niśīthasūtra* completely, including their *niyukti*, commentary, *cūrṇi*, and *ṭīkā*.

According to the *niyukti* and commentary, the sūtra number of the *niśītha* is 2022 (two thousand twenty-two). The present edition has 1401 sūtras. Although the sūtra numbers may differ in the available manuscripts, the difference is not significant. However, the difference between the sūtra number of the present edition and the sūtra number mentioned in the *niyukti* and commentary is 621 sūtras. This significant difference in the original sūtras is worth considering.

The discussion of the sūtras in the present edition is mostly based on the commentary and *cūrṇi*.

Twentieth Uddeshak]
It is said that the number of sutras in this Uddeshak is different from the total number of sutras in the entire Nishītha, as mentioned in the Bhāṣya Gāthā 6469 to 73, and the number of Laghu, Guru, Māsika, Chaumāsika, and Prāropaṇa sutras. It is also impossible to reconcile this with the available number of sutras. For example,
In the first Uddeshak, the number of sutras available is 58, and the Bhāṣya Chūrṇi also explains the same number of sutras, yet this Uddeshak is said to have 252 sutras in the aforementioned Gāthās. Therefore, the statement of 2022 sutras is very difficult to understand. In the present time, those who love to study the scriptures will have to be content with only 1401 sutras. Researchers, thoughtful Āgama lovers, and those who have studied extensively can try to find a solution to this.

##  Unfavorable Time for Study

[Quoted from the Nandi Sutra, edited by Acharya Pravar Shri Pratmaramji Maharaj]

One should study scriptures only during the time prescribed in the Pramanas for study. Studying during unfavorable times is prohibited.

The Manusmriti and other Smritis also describe unfavorable times in detail. Vedic people also mention unfavorable times for studying the Vedas. Similarly, other ancient texts are also considered unfavorable for study. Since the Jain Agamas are the words of the omniscient, are divinely inspired, and are a form of self-knowledge, their unfavorable times are also mentioned in the Agamas. For example:

**Ten unfavorable times related to the sky:**

1. **Ukkavate (Meteor Shower):** If there is a large meteor shower, one should not study for one prahar (3 hours).
2. **Disidaaghe (Red Sky):** One should not study as long as the sky appears red, as if it is on fire.

**Ten unfavorable times related to the body:**

1. **Atthi (Eating):** One should not study while eating.
2. **Mansam (Meat):** One should not study while eating meat.
3. **Sonitte (Blood):** One should not study while dealing with blood.
4. **Asutisamante (Near a Dead Body):** One should not study near a dead body.
5. **Susanasamante (Near a Cemetery):** One should not study near a cemetery.
6. **Chandovarate (During the Moon's Eclipse):** One should not study during a lunar eclipse.
7. **Surovvarate (During the Sun's Eclipse):** One should not study during a solar eclipse.
8. **Padane (Falling):** One should not study after falling.
9. **Rayavuggahe (Loss of Wealth):** One should not study after losing wealth.
10. **Uvassayassa Anto Oralie Sarirage (During the Last Moments of Life):** One should not study during the last moments of life.

**Four Mahapadivaa (Major Days):**

* **Praashadpadivaa (Ashadha Purnima):** One should not study on the full moon day of Ashadha.
* **Indamahapadivaa (Indra Purnima):** One should not study on the full moon day of Indra.
* **Kattiapadivaa (Kartika Purnima):** One should not study on the full moon day of Kartika.
* **Sugimhapadivaa (Shravana Purnima):** One should not study on the full moon day of Shravana.

**Four Sanjha (Junctions):**

* **Padimate (Dawn):** One should not study at dawn.
* **Pachchimaate (Sunset):** One should not study at sunset.
* **Majjhanhe (Noon):** One should not study at noon.
* **Addharatte (Midnight):** One should not study at midnight.

**Four Chaukkal (Quarters):**

* **Puvanhe (Morning):** One should study in the morning.
* **Avaranhe (Afternoon):** One should study in the afternoon.
* **Panose (Evening):** One should study in the evening.
* **Pacchuse (Night):** One should study at night.

According to the above sutra, there are 32 unfavorable times for study: ten related to the sky, ten related to the body, four Mahapadivaa, four Mahapadivaa full moons, and four Sanjha. These are summarized as follows:

**Ten unfavorable times related to the sky:**

1. **Ukkavate (Meteor Shower):** One should not study for one prahar (3 hours) after a large meteor shower.
2. **Disidaaghe (Red Sky):** One should not study as long as the sky appears red, as if it is on fire.

##  Unfavorable Times for Study (Anadhyaya)

**3-4. Thunder, Lightning, and Rain:** Thunder, lightning, and rain are generally associated with the natural course of the seasons. Therefore, the period from Ardra to Swati Nakshatra is not considered unfavorable for study.

**5. Nirdhaat:** If there is a loud thunderclap in a cloudless sky, or if there is thunder and lightning in a cloudy sky, then there is an unfavorable period for study for two praharas (approximately 3 hours).

**6. Yupaka:** In the Shukla Paksha (bright fortnight), the first, second, and third days are called Yupaka. This is when the light of the setting sun and the moon combine. During these days, one should not study from the evening until night.

**7. Yakshadeepta:** If there is a flash of light in any direction, like lightning, but it is intermittent and appears at intervals, it is called Yakshadeepta. One should not study as long as this light appears in the sky.

**8. Dhumika Krishna:** From Kartik to Magh (October-February), the time is considered the gestation period for clouds. During this time, a fine, smoky, watery mist falls, which is called Dhumika Krishna. One should not study as long as this mist falls.

**9. Mihika Shweta:** In winter, a fine, white, watery mist falls, which is called Mihika. One should not study as long as this mist falls.

**10. Raj Udghat:** Due to wind, dust spreads throughout the sky. One should not study as long as this dust remains.

These ten reasons are related to the sky and are unfavorable for study. The following ten reasons are related to worldly matters.

**11-12-13. Bones, Flesh, and Blood:** If one sees the bones, flesh, or blood of a five-sensed animal, then one should not study until these things are removed from sight. Some scholars consider it unfavorable for study within a radius of 60 hands (approximately 90 feet) from these things.

Similarly, the bones, flesh, and blood of a human being are also considered unfavorable for study. However, the unfavorable period for these is considered to be within a radius of 100 hands (approximately 150 feet) and lasts for one day and night. The unfavorable period for a woman's menstrual cycle is three days. The unfavorable period for the birth of a child is seven days for a boy and eight days for a girl.

**14. Impurity:** One should not study as long as excrement or urine is visible.

**15. Cremation Ground:** The area within a radius of 100 hands (approximately 150 feet) around a cremation ground is considered unfavorable for study.

**16. Lunar Eclipse:** During a lunar eclipse, one should not study for a minimum of 12 praharas (approximately 18 hours) for a low-level text, 12 praharas for a medium-level text, and 16 praharas for a high-level text.

**17. Solar Eclipse:** During a solar eclipse, one should not study for a minimum of 12 praharas (approximately 18 hours) for a low-level text, 12 praharas for a medium-level text, and 16 praharas for a high-level text.

## Chapter 18:  Anadhyayakala

**18. Patan:**  When a great king or a national leader dies, one should not perform *svadhyaya* until their cremation is completed. Alternatively, one should gradually resume *svadhyaya* only after a new authority takes over.

**19. Rajavyudgraha:**  When neighboring kings are engaged in war, one should not perform *svadhyaya* for one day and night, even after peace is restored.

**20. Audarik Sharira:**  When a five-sense being dies within the *upaashraya*, one should not perform *svadhyaya* as long as the body remains there. If the lifeless body lies within a hundred *haath* (cubits), *svadhyaya* should be avoided.

The above ten reasons for avoiding *svadhyaya* are related to the *audarik sharira* (physical body).

**21-28. Four Mahotsav and Four Mahapratipada:**  The four *mahotsav* (festivals) are: *Shraavana Purnima*, *Ashwin Purnima*, *Kartik Purnima*, and *Chaitra Purnima*. The *pratipada* (first day) following these *purnima* (full moon) days are called *mahapratipada*. *Svadhyaya* is prohibited on these days.

**29-32. Pratah, Sayam, Madhyahna, and Ardharatri:**  One should not perform *svadhyaya* one *ghadi* (hour) before and after sunrise, one *ghadi* before and after sunset, one *ghadi* before and after midday, and one *ghadi* before and after midnight.
