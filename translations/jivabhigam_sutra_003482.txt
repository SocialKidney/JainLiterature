The revered Shri Suvrata Muni 'Satyarthī Shāstrī M.A. (Hindi-Sanskrit), a highly respected scholar, a master of truth, an enlightened sage, a treasure trove of Āgama knowledge, a supreme Shramaṇa, and the late Yuvacharya Shri Mishrīmalji M. 'Madhukar' ji, was the undisputed authority on ancient knowledge. Under his guidance and as the chief editor, the great Shruta-yajña of Jain Āgama publication began, which saw the publication of Shri Prāchārāṅga, Uttarādhyayana, Vyākhyāprajñapti, and Upāsakadaśāṅga sūtras, by the grace of the Guru. The contemporary language and style of the Āgamas, along with their comparative analysis and interpretation, are extremely laborious. The research-based introductions, essential footnotes, and appendices have made the Āgamas accessible to both general and specialized readers, and are extremely useful for modern research methods. The beautiful and pure printing of all the sūtras, the excellent paper and cover, are very attractive. The publication of 30 massive Āgamas in a very short time is a significant contribution. The credit for this goes to the founder of the Shruta-yajña, the Āgama-expert, the revered Yuvacharya Shri ji M. However, all the revered Gurus, the Saadhvi-vrinda, and the Sad-grihasthas who have contributed to this great Shruta-yajña are commendable and praiseworthy. The Āgama Publication Committee deserves special congratulations. For Private & Personal use only

We are experiencing joy in presenting the 30th volume of the Prakashkiy Shri Jinagam-Granthamala, 'Jivajivaabhigam (First Volume)' to the loving readers of Agam. The presented Sutra is vast and requires detailed discussion due to its theoretical description. Without doing so, inquisitive readers cannot be fully satisfied. Keeping this vision in mind, learned Muni Shri Rajendra Muniji has done a sufficiently detailed discussion. This has made it very convenient for the readers to understand the heart of the Sutra, but it has also increased its size. Even so, we had planned to print it in a single volume, but due to some adverse circumstances, we are forced to publish it in two volumes. This will also be an advantage as it will be more convenient for readers to carry and keep with them during travel. Efforts will be made to publish the second volume of the presented Sutra as soon as possible. Shri Rajendra Muniji is a distinguished scholar and researcher of the Agams, as well as a writer of the highest caliber. This is natural because he is the disciple of distinguished enlightened Munirajas like Upadhyaya Shri Pushkar Muniji M. and Upadhyay Shri Devendra Muniji M. Editing and discussing Jivajivaabhigam is not an easy task, yet Munishri accepted our request and took up this great laborious task and completed it in a short time, we do not have words to express our gratitude for this. We have received invaluable cooperation from the great Saraswati devotee Upadhyay Shri Devendra Muniji M., who is constantly engaged in the propagation of Jinvani, since the beginning of the Granthamala publication. It can be said without a doubt that if we had not received the support of Upadhyay Shri, the publication work would not have been possible at the speed at which it has been done. You have benefited us by writing a scholarly introduction to the presented Sutra. The work of editing and revising Pragambattisi is complete. The publication of the Cheda Sutras was stopped due to the need to print the second edition of Pracharang and Upasakadashang in between. Now they have been sent to the press. Panditraj Shri Kanhaiyalalji M. 'Kamal', the propagator of Pragam-Anuyog, has put in a lot of effort and taken interest in the editing etc. of the Cheda Sutras. We cannot be indebted to your kindness. We are grateful to all those great people who have contributed and are contributing to this great work.

**Editorial Statement**

The nectar-like, pre-scriptural pronouncements of the omniscient, all-seeing, dispassionate Supreme Being, the Jinesvara Devas, are not only a priceless treasure of the world's religious literature, but also a life-saving elixir for the lives of all beings. This discourse, as prescribed by the worthy ones, is that pot of nectar which removes all poisons and afflictions, and bestows new life upon all beings in the world. The origin of the Jain Agamas is for the sake of compassion, in the form of protection of the world's beings. Non-violence, compassion, kindness, affection, and friendship are its essence. Therefore, it is the most beneficial, protective, and helpful for the world's beings. This Jain discourse is a form of salvation, refuge, momentum, and foundation for all beings.

The ancient teachers have compared this pre-scriptural pronouncements to the ocean. They said, "This Jain Agama is like a great ocean. It is boundless in knowledge, filled to the brim with the best words, and vast in extent due to the waves of endless non-violence. The tide of the ocean is rising in it, it is filled with jewels obtained through the grace of the Guru, and it is difficult to cross. It is the ultimate essence and auspiciousness. One should worship this ocean of the primary form of the Mahavira Supreme Being with devotion."

Indeed, the Jain Agama is vast and profound like the ocean. However, with the grace of the Guru and effort, one can dive into it and obtain the essential jewels. The essence of Jain discourse is non-violence and equality. As stated in the Sutra Kritanga Sutra, "To consider all beings as oneself and not to harm them, this is the essence of religion, the path to self-welfare." Jain principles are imbued with non-violence, and in the world burning with the fire of violence, the endless stream of non-violence is beneficial. Therefore, the study, practice, and widespread dissemination of Jain principles is the primary need of the present age. Only through the practice of non-violence is there a possibility of world peace, therefore, the study and practice of the Jain Agamas, which are imbued with non-violence, is paramount.

The Jain Agamas are in the form of the twelve-part Ganipitaka. After attaining omniscience, the Arhant Tirthankara Supreme Being, in essence, formulates the discourse, and their fourteen predecessors, the wise and knowledgeable Ganadharas, bind them in the form of sutras.

**Sutra-vyakarana Sutra 1:**

1. For the protection and compassion of all beings in the world, the Bhagavan has spoken.
2. Boundless in knowledge, with a path of excellent words, beautiful with water, with waves of non-violence, it is vast in extent. The tide is rising, it is filled with jewels obtained from the Guru, and it is difficult to cross. The essence is the ocean of the pre-scriptural pronouncements, worship it with devotion.
3. Know that non-violence and time are the limits.

This is the tradition of preaching that continues. The originator of the Artha-rupa Pragama is the Tirthankara, the Supreme Being, and the originator of the Shabda-rupa Pragama is the Ganadhara. / The tradition of the Mahant and their Ganadharas has been going on for an infinite time. Therefore, the tradition of their teachings, the Pragama, has been going on since the beginning of time. That is why it is said that this Dvadasangi is Dhruva, Nitya, Shashwat, it has always been. It was never not, it is never not, it will never not be... that is also not the case. / It always was, is, and always will be. In terms of feelings, it is Dhruva, Nitya, Shashwat. The Dvadasangi includes twelve Angas. Pracharang, Sutra-kritang, Stanang, Samavayang, Vyakhya-Prajnapti, Jnatadharmakatha, Upasakadasha, Antakrid Dasha, Anuropapatik, Prashnavyakaran, Vipaksutra and Drishtivad. / These are the twelve Angas. This is the Dvadasangi Ganipitaka, which is directly taught by the Tirthankaras. This is called Anga-pravist Pragama. / In addition, the Ananga-pravist Anga-bahir Pragama are those that have been composed by the learned elders who are endowed with Prajnatishya, in a way that is not contradictory to the words of the Tirthankaras. Thus, the Jain Agam is divided into two parts - Anga-pravist and Ananga-pravist (Anga-bahir). / The present Jiva-abhigam Shastra is Ananga-pravist Agam. From another perspective, the twelve Angas are also called twelve Upangas. Accordingly, Aushapatik etc. are given the name Upanga. Acharya Malayagiri, who wrote a detailed commentary on Jiva-abhigam, has called it the Upanga of the third Anga - Stanang. In the beginning of the present Jiva-abhigam Sutra, the learned elders are presented as the model for this study. That passage is as follows: 'Ih Khalu Jinamya Jinanumaya, Jinanuloma Jinappaniya Jinapparuviya Jinakhaya Jinanuchinna Jinapganatta Jinadesiya Jinapasattha Anuveeya Tam Saddhamana Tam Pattiyamana Tam Royamana Yera Bhagavanta Jiwa Jivaabhigamanamjayanam Pannavansu / ' 'Having contemplated this excellent Jinamat, which is approved by all the Jineshwars, Jinanuloma, Jinapranit, Jinaprarupit, Jinakhyat, Jinanuchirna Jin-prajnapta and Jindeshit, and having faith, belief and interest in it, the learned elders have formulated the study called Jiva-abhigam. The above statement makes it clear that the present Sutra has been composed by the learned elders. Those learned elders were the true knowers of the teachings of the Tirthankaras. They had faith, belief and interest in their words. This implies that the Pragama formulated by such learned elders is also as authoritative as the Agam formulated by the omniscient, all-seeing Tirthankara. / Because the composition of the learned elders is not contradictory to the words of the Tirthankaras. The explanation of the special qualities of Jinamat that appear in the present text has been given in the discussion of the original text. The present Sutra is called Jiva-abhigam, but because it mainly deals with the Jiva, or from a concise perspective, this Sutra is also known as 'Jiva-abhigam'. 1.

Jain philosophy is primarily **ātmavādī** (soul-centric). The **jīva** (soul) is its central point. Although Jain doctrine has recognized nine **tattvas** (principles) or seven **tattvas** by including **puṇya** (merit), **pāpa** (demerit), **prāsrava** (influx), **bandha** (bond) in one principle, all of them are merely different states of the relationship or separation of the **jīva** and **ajīva** (non-soul) **karma-dravya** (matter of karma). The purpose of describing the **ajīva** principle is to clarify the nature of the **jīva** principle and to distinguish it from its different nature. **Puṇya**, **pāpa**, **prāsrava**, **samvara** (restriction), **nirjarā** (efflux), **bandha**, and **mokṣa** (liberation) are states that arise from the union and separation of the **jīva** and **karma**. Therefore, it can be said that the root of Jain philosophy is **ātma-dravya** (soul-matter). Its beginning is **ātma-vicāra** (self-reflection) and its ultimate culmination is **mokṣa**. This **sūtra** (text) discusses the **ātma-dravya**, i.e., the **jīva**, in detail. Therefore, it is called **jīvābhigama** (approach to the soul). **Abhigama** means knowledge. That which provides knowledge of the **jīva** and **ajīva** is **jīvābhigama**. After generally mentioning the distinctions of the **ajīva** principle, the entire purpose of this **sūtra** is to focus on the **jīva** principle. The **jīva** is divided into two categories: **siddh** (liberated) and **saṁsāra-samāpannaka** (bound to the cycle of existence). Subsequently, the **sūtra** discusses the various distinctions of **saṁsāra-samāpannaka** **jīvas** in terms of nine **pratipattis** (perspectives). These nine **pratipattis** are presented from different perspectives, and therefore, despite being different, they are not contradictory and are factual. These nine **pratipattis** describe how the **jīva**, transformed by the **vibhāva** (causes) of **rāga** (attachment), **dveṣa** (aversion), etc., experiences various states, forms, births, deaths, etc., in the world. They describe the **jīvātmā** (soul) experiencing various states as **sa-sthāvara** (with a body), as **strī** (female), **puruṣa** (male), **napumsaka** (neuter), as **nārak** (hell being), **tiryañc** (animal), **manuṣya** (human), and **deva** (god), as having one sense to five senses, as having an earth body to a **trasa-kāya** (body of the **trasa**), and as experiencing birth and death in various other forms from other perspectives. The **dvi-vidha** (two-fold) **pratipatti** describes the distinctions of **jīvas** as **sa-sthāvara** through 23 **dvāras** (gates): 1) **śarīra** (body), 2) **avagāhanā** (perception), 3) **saṁhanana** (concentration), 4) **saṁsthāna** (structure), 5) **kaṣāya** (passions), 6) **saṁjñā** (consciousness), 7) **leśyāḥ** (subtle karmic tendencies), 8) **indriya** (sense organs), 9) **samudghāta** (awakening), 10) **saṁjñī-asaṁjñī** (conscious-unconscious), 11) **veda** (knowledge), 12) **paryāpti-aparyāpti** (sufficient-insufficient), 13) **dṛṣṭi** (view), 14) **darśana** (perception), 15) **jñāna** (knowledge), 16) **yoga** (concentration), 17) **upayoga** (application), 18) **prāhāra** (intake), 19) **upapāta** (occurrence), 20) **sthiti** (state), 21) **samavahata-prasamavahata** (flowing-non-flowing), 22) **cyavana** (decay), and 23) **gati-prāgati** (motion-progress). Similarly, the other **pratipattis** also describe the various distinctions of the **jīva** through different **dvāras**. The **dvāras** of **sthiti** (state), **saṁciṭaṇā** (accumulation), **antara** (difference), and **pralpa-bahutva** (few-many) are mentioned as much as possible throughout. The final **pratipatti** does not distinguish between **siddh** and **saṁsārī** (bound to the cycle of existence) but describes the distinctions of all **jīvas**. This **sūtra** describes **adholoka** (lower world), **tiryak loka** (intermediate world), and **ūrvāloka** (upper world) in the context of **nārak**, **tiryañc**, **manuṣya**, and **deva**. The description of **tiryak loka** includes the mention of islands and oceans, the mention of **karma-bhūmi** (land of karma) and **akarma-bhūmi** (land of no karma), and a detailed discussion of the geographical and cultural conditions there, which is significant from various perspectives. Thus, this **sūtra** and its subject matter provide detailed information about the **jīva**, therefore, its name **jīvābhigama** is meaningful. This **abhigama** is an important part of Jain philosophy. The original source of this **sūtra** is a **grantha** (text) of 6750 **granthānas** (units of measurement). **Ācārya** (teacher) **Malayagiri** wrote a commentary on it with 14000 **granthānas**, revealing the essence of this profound **abhigama**. The commentator, with his intellectual brilliance, has illuminated the essence of the **abhigama** for us ordinary people, benefiting us greatly. Regarding the edition, the main source of the original text of this
Page #11:
---------------------------
This is the original text of the Jivaabhigaman Sutra with commentary, but in many places the published text differs from the commentary. This difference suggests that the commentator had access to a different (ideal) manuscript. Therefore, in many places we have adopted the commentator's version as the original text, as it seemed more appropriate. Such variations are noted in footnotes. The commentator himself mentions that there are differences in the seven chapters of this Praagam. It is important to remember that these differences are in the words, not the meaning. There is no difference in the essence, only in the words and their order. In such places, we have adopted the commentator's version as the original text. The commentary by Acharya Shri Malayagiri has been the main basis for the translation and analysis of this Praagam. We have made every effort to present the theoretical content of this important text in a clear and concise manner for the benefit of the inquisitive reader. Therefore, we have included in the analysis almost all the main points clarified in the commentary, so that those who do not understand Sanskrit can also benefit from them. I believe that this effort will enable Hindi-speaking readers to understand all the essential points explained in the commentary in Sanskrit. From this perspective, the usefulness of this edition is greatly enhanced. If the inquisitive reader benefits from this, I will consider my efforts worthwhile. Finally, I consider myself fortunate to have had the opportunity to prepare this edition. The Praagam Prakashan Samiti, Byawar, entrusted me with the responsibility of editing the Jivaabhigaman Sutra presented here. Considering the seriousness of the Sutra, I was certainly hesitant about my own competence, but inspired by devotion to the scriptures, I accepted this responsibility and dedicated myself to its execution. Whatever I could do is presented before the readers in this form. Acknowledgement - In this effort of mine to serve the scriptures, I have received the skillful guidance and direction of the venerable Guru Shri Pushkarmuniji Maharaj and the Upadhyay of the Shraman Sangh, the literary sage, the renowned writer Shri Devendra Muniji Maharaj, as a result of which I have been able to complete this Herculean task. I am eternally grateful to these revered Gurus. The venerable Upadhyay Shri has also had the great kindness to write a scholarly introduction to this Praagam. This has added to the usefulness of this edition. While editing this Praagam, I received significant assistance from the renowned scholar of the Jain community, Pandit Shri Basantlalji Nalvaya of Ratlam. I cannot forget to express my gratitude for his scholarly and dedicated assistance. I am primarily grateful to the Seth Devanand Lalbhai Pustak Uddhar Fund, Surat, whose published edition has been used in this work. I express my heartfelt gratitude to the Praagam Prakashan Samiti, Byawar, and all other direct and indirect contributors.

If this effort of mine will benefit the inquisitive Agam-rasiks with theoretical sattvic gain, then I will consider my effort worthwhile. In the end, I wish that the hearts of all people may be filled with faith, belief, and interest in the principles established by the Jineswar Devas, so that they may become pilgrims on the path of liberation by worshipping the three jewels of knowledge, vision, and conduct.

**Introduction**

Jiva-Jiva-Abhigham: A Critical Study is a precious jewel-casket in the Jain Agam world. If we consider it from the perspective of the world's religious and philosophical literature, its place becomes even more dignified and glorious. In the vast expanse of religious and philosophical literature, Jain Agams and Jain literature occupy the same place as the moon and the sun among countless twinkling stars and constellations. Without Jain literature, the light of world literature is dim and dull. Western thinkers like Dr. Hermann Jacobi, Dr. Schubing, etc., also unanimously accept the truth that the Jain Agams have a beautiful harmony of philosophy and life, conduct and thought, emotion and duty, which is rare in other literature.

Jain Agams are an inexhaustible treasury of knowledge and science. It is as vast as its literal form, but its subtle and profound contemplation is even more expansive and great. The Jain Agams have declared the soul to be an eternal entity and have shown it the path of supreme purity. Along with this, they have propounded the holy confluence of right knowledge, right faith, and right conduct as its means. They have inspired the attainment of the ultimate peak and supreme excellence of life through the worship of renunciation, detachment, and self-control. They have revealed the eternal truth of life. Not only have they revealed it, but they have also made it practicable and applicable in conduct.

By the power of their practice, the proponents of the Jain Agams first recognized the truth themselves, knew the reality, and then they modeled the truth. Therefore, their thinking has the element of experience. It is not a flight of fancy, but an experiential reality-based thinking. The realistic and detached Jineshwars had a direct experience of the true essence and modeled it for the welfare of the beings of the world. This modeling and description is the Jain Agam. Being modeled by the realistic and truthful, it is true, unquestionable, and being a received word, it is Agam. Those who have conquered attachment and aversion are Jins, Tirthankaras, omniscient Lords, and their teachings and words are the Jain Agams. Because in them, due to the speaker's realistic vision and detachment, there is no possibility of fault, nor is there any contradiction or logical fallacy.

**Origin of Jain Agams**

Regarding the origin of the Jain Agams, Shri Bhadrabahu Swami has said in Praavshak Niyukti and Shri Jinbhadra Ganik Shamaashraman in Vishesh Avshayak Bhashya:

1. Sanvjagajivarakkhanadayattyaye paavayanam bhagavaya sukahyam /
2. Tamev saccham nisshank janjinehi paveiyam /
3. Praaptavachanaadavirbhatamarthasanvedanamaagam: /

The omniscient, liberated Kevalis, who have ascended the tree of austerities, rules, and knowledge, shower down knowledge-flowers to enlighten the masses. The Ganadharas receive them in a vessel of intellect and use them to compose sermons. They preach the meaning and the Ganadharas skillfully weave them into sutras. Thus, sutras are established for the benefit of the Dharma. The Tirthankaras are the originators of the meaningful texts. Acharya Devavachana has therefore called the scriptures as Tirthankara-created. Enlightened readers should remember that the authenticity of the Agam literature is not only due to its creation by the Ganadharas, but also because of the Tirthankara's freedom from passions and omniscience, who are the formulators of the meaning. The Ganadharas only compose the twelve Angas. The Staviras compose the external scriptures. Acharya Malayagiri and others believe that the Ganadharas ask the Tirthankaras about the essence of reality. In response, the Tirthankaras utter the three-line verse "Uppanṇā i vā vigamei vā dhūvei vā". This three-line verse is called "Mataka-pada" because the Ganadharas compose the twelve Angas based on it. This twelve-Anga form of the pre-Agam literature is expanded as the Anga-included. All the remaining compositions are external to the Angas. The twelve Angas are born from the three-line verse, therefore they are created by the Ganadharas. It should also be remembered that not all compositions created by the Ganadharas are Angas. Compositions created through free grammar in the absence of the three-line verse, even if created by Ganadharas or Staviras, are considered external to the Angas. There are two types of Staviras - Chaturdashapurvi and Dashapurvi. They are complete knowers of the Anga literature in terms of sutras and meaning. Whatever they compose or say, there is no contradiction whatsoever. Acharya Sanghadas Gani believes that what a Tirthankara can say, a Shrutakevali can also say in the same way. The only difference is that the Kevali knows the entire truth directly, while the Shrutakevali knows it indirectly through scriptural knowledge. Their words are also authentic because they are always right-sighted. They always follow the path of scriptural preaching. Their proclamation is that this scriptural preaching is true, without doubt, this is the meaning, the ultimate truth, the rest is meaningless. Therefore, there is no possibility of contradictory facts in the texts composed by them. Their statements are not contradictory to the twelve Angas. Therefore, the texts composed by them are also considered authentic like the Agam.

---------------------------
The earliest classification of the Purvas and Angas in Jain Agamas is found in the Samavayanga Sutra, where the number of Purvas is mentioned as fourteen and the number of Angas as twelve. There are two traditions of knowledge in Jain literature: Purvadhara and Dvadashaangaveta. Purvadharas have a higher position in terms of knowledge. The ascetics who possessed the knowledge of the fourteen Purvas were called Shrutakevali. The Purvas contained a detailed discussion of all objects and subjects, therefore their extent and evidence was very vast and profound. No good thing was left untouched by the scope of the Purvas. There are different opinions of scholars regarding the composition of the Purvas. According to the opinion of Acharya Abhaydeva and others, the Purva literature was composed before the Dvadashaangi. This is why it is called Purva. Some thinkers believe that the Purvas are the collection of scriptures from the tradition of Lord Parshvanath. Due to the subject matter of the Purvas being very serious, difficult and inaccessible, it was only useful for specific क्षयोपशमधारियों. In order to make the subject useful for ordinary people, the Angas were composed. As stated in the Visheshaavashyak Bhashya, "Although there is a complete revelation of knowledge in the Bhutvad or Drishtivad, but for the benefit of people with limited intellect, the rest of the scriptures were extracted from it, and on the basis of that, the entire literature was created." Currently, the Purvas are not considered separate from the Dvadashaangi. Drishtivad is the twelfth Anga. Until the creation of the Pracharang and other Anga literature, the entire collection of scriptures was known as Purva or Drishtivad. When the Angas were created, Drishtivad was given a place as the twelfth Anga after the eleven Angas including Pracharang. In Agama literature, there is a description of both types of ascetics who read the twelve Angas and those who read the fourteen Purvas, but both refer to the same thing. Those who were Chaturdashapurvi were also Dvadashaangavit because the twelfth Anga itself contains the fourteen Purvas. The second classification of Agamas is done as Angapravesh and Angabahya. Angapravesh: Angabahya Acharya Jinabhadragani Kshamasraman, while analyzing Angapravesh and Angabahya, said: 1. Chaudasapubya pannatta tam jaha - Uppayapubba............tah vindusar. 2. (a) Prathama purva tasya sarvapravachanat purva kriyamanatvat - Samavayanga batti. (b) Sarvashrutat purva kriyate iti purvani, utpadapurvadiini chaturdasha. (c) Jamha titthakaro titthpavattaanakale ganadharana savvasuttaadharattanato puvvam puvvagatasuttattham bhasati tamha punvam ti bhanita. - Nandi Churni 3. Jaivi ya bhuyaavaae savvasya ya bhagamassa poyaro. Nijjuhana taha vi hu dummehe pappa itthi ya. - Visheshaavashyak Bhashya Gatha, 551.

**Angpravist Shrut** is that which (1) is composed in the form of sutras by the Ganadharas, (2) is propounded by the Tirthankaras when questioned by the Ganadharas, (3) is eternal and long-lasting due to its relation to eternal truths. In this regard, it is said that the Dvadasanga Ganipitaka was never, is not, will never be, and will never be. It was, is, and will be. It is eternal, fixed, everlasting, imperishable, unchanging, existing, and constant.

**Angbahya Shrut** is that which (1) is established, (2) is propounded by the Tirthankaras without being questioned, (3) is universal, i.e., it is present in the Tirtha of all Tirthankaras. This is not the case, for example, with the Tandulavaicharik etc. chapters.

The commentator of the Nandi Sutra, Acharya Malayagiri, while explaining Angpravist and Angbahya, wrote: "The fundamental sutras composed by the Ganadharas, who are endowed with the most excellent knowledge of the Shrut, which are completely fixed, are the Angpravist Shrut like the Pracharanga etc. Other Shrut, composed by the Sthaviras, are the Angbahya Shrut."

Angbahya is of two types: **Aavashyak** and **Aavashyakvyatirikt**.

Aavashyakvyatirikt Shrut is of two types: (1) **Kalik** and (2) **Utkalik**.

The Shrut that is read in the first and last prahar of the night and day is **Kalik** Shrut, and that which can be read at any time by ringing the time bell is **Utkalik** Shrut. The Nandi Sutra mentions the names of Kalik and Utkalik sutras.

The most recent classification of Ang, Upang, Mul, and Chhed Agamas is: Ang, Upang, Mul, and Chhed.

The Nandi Sutra does not use the term Upang, nor does it mention Mul and Chhed. There, the term Angbahya is found in the sense of Upang.

Acharya Shrichand, whose time is considered to be before 1112 AD, composed the Sukhabodha Samachari. In it, he used the term "Upang" in the sense of Angbahya while describing the tapasvidhi of the study of the Agamas. The term Upang is also used in the Chandi literature.

The division of Mul and Chhed sutras cannot be said to have been established from the beginning.

The Pravacharcharit, composed in Vikram Samvat 1334, first mentions the division of Ang, Upang, Mul, and Chhed. The implication is that this division had already taken place in the latter half of the 13th century.

There is no consensus on the number and names of Mul and Chhed sutras.

Regarding the number of Ang literature, the Svetambaras and Digambaras are of one mind. They all accept twelve Angs. However, there are different opinions on the number of Angbahya Pragama.

The Svetambara Murtipujakas accept 45 Pragama, while the Sthanakvasi and Terapanthi accept 32 Agamas.

The Svetambara Murtipujakas consider 11 Ang, 12 Upang, 6 Mul sutras, 6 Chhed sutras, and 10 Painna - thus 45 Pragama - as authoritative. According to the Sthanakvasi and Terapanthi, 11 Ang, 12 Upang, 4 Mul sutras, 4 Chhed sutras, and 1 Praavashyak sutra - thus 32 - are considered authoritative at present.

**Jivajivoabhigam** - The Jivajivoabhigam Sutra presented here, according to the above classification, is Upang Shrut and Kalik Sutra:

1. Ganahar-therakayam va paesa mukkavagaranpo va / ghav-chalaviseso va angaange su naanattm / / - Visheshaavashyak Bhashya Ma. 550 [14]

This is mentioned in the commentary by Acharya Malayagiri, who calls it an Upanga of the third Anga, the "Sthananga".  He describes the importance of this Pragama, saying that this Upanga, called "Jivajivaabhigam", is like a supreme mantra for removing the poison of attachment, like water for extinguishing the fire of hatred, like the sun for destroying the darkness of ignorance, and like a bridge for crossing the ocean of existence. It is attainable through great effort and possesses the infallible power to attain liberation. The aforementioned descriptions by the commentator clearly highlight the importance of this Pragama. The first sutra of this Agama mentions the Stavira Bhagavants as its promulgators, stating: "Those Stavira Bhagavants, having thoroughly examined the principles embodied in the Tirthankaras, with their unique wisdom, and having deep faith, affection, interest, conviction, and profound belief in them, have formulated the study of Jivas and Ajivas." This statement expresses that the Stavira Bhagavants are the originators of this Pragama. Whatever those Staviras have said is indeed said by the Jinesvara Devas, is sanctioned by them, is formulated by them, is embodied by them, is declared by them, is established by them, is proclaimed by them, is taught by them, is as smooth and beneficial as a path, and is a Pragama that, through tradition, grants attainment of Jinahood. Although the words of this Pragama are spoken by the Stavira Bhagavants, its meaning is taught by the Tirthankaras, making it as authoritative as the Dvadasanga. Thus, the authenticity of this Pragama is revealed. The authenticity of the Upanga Shrutis lies in their conformity with the Anga Shrutis. The Shruti is imagined as a person. Just as a person has limbs and appendages, the Shruti-person is also recognized as having twelve Angas and twelve Upangas. The two feet, two shanks, two thighs, the front and back parts of the body (chest and back), two arms, the neck, and the head are considered the twelve limbs of a person. Similarly, the Shruti-person has twelve Angas, starting with the Pracharanga. Just as there are appendages to assist the limbs, the Upanga Shrutis are established as auxiliary and supplementary. Twelve Upangas are recognized for the twelve Angas. In the Vedic tradition, the Vedangas and Upangas are also recognized as auxiliary or supplementary to the Vedas, known as Shiksha, Vyakarana, Chanda, Nirukta, Jyotish, and Kalpa. Puranas, Nyaya, Mimamsa, and Dharmashastras are also accepted as Upangas. There is a need for coherence in the subject matter of the Angas and Upangas, which is not clearly evident. This is a matter that must be considered by scholars. The name of this sutra is Jivajivaabhigam, but due to the concise presentation of Ajivas and the detailed presentation of Jivas, it is known as "Jivaabhigam". It discusses the differences and distinctions between Jivas and Ajivas in the form of questions and answers between Bhagavan Mahavira and Ganadhara Gautam. From a traditional perspective, this Pragama had 20 Uddesakas. 1. This is the Pragama called Jivajivaabhigam, which is like a supreme mantra for removing the poison of attachment, like water for extinguishing the fire of hatred, like the sun for destroying the darkness of ignorance, and like a bridge for crossing the ocean of existence. It is attainable through great effort and possesses the infallible power to attain liberation. - Malayagiri Vritti 2. The Theras Bhagavants, following the path, accepting, and praising this, which is Jina-made, Jina-particle-made, Jina-particle-like, Jina-formulated, Jina-embodied, Jina-declared, Jina-marked, Jina-sanctioned, Jina-taught, and Jina-beneficial, have expounded the Jivajivaabhigam. - Jiva. Sutra 1 [ 15 ]

And the twentieth Uddeshak was explained by Shri Chandrasuri, the disciple of Shri Shalibhadrasuri. Shri Abhaydev wrote Sangrahni on its third pada. However, in its present form, it has only nine pratipattis (chapters) which are divided into 272 sutras. It is possible that a significant part of this Maagam has been lost, and the remaining part has been compiled into nine pratipattis. The available edition has 9 pratipattis, one adhyayan, 18 uddeshak, 4750 shloka praman text, 272 gadyasutra and 81 padya (gatha). The famous Vrittikar Shri Malayagiri wrote a Vritti on it. He mentioned the difference in readings at many places in his Vritti. The original text given in the edition of Jivaabhigam published by Pragamoday Samiti has differences in places from the manuscript that was in front of the Vrittikar, which the Vrittikar himself has mentioned at various places. An attempt has been made to mention such differences in readings at various places in the discussion and commentary of the present edition. It is to be remembered here that even though there are differences in words, there is usually no difference in meaning. Here, an important point to consider is that the description of Shruta literature given in Shruta texts like Nandi Sutra etc. is not available in the present time. Much of the vast Shruta literature mentioned in it has been lost and much has also been changed. The form and quantity of Shruta at the time of Bhagwan Mahavira gradually decreased due to famine etc., due to the defects of time and due to the decline of wisdom and brilliance. From time to time, readings of Praagams have been done to protect the remaining Shruta. It will not be irrelevant to give a brief description of them here. Readings have been done for the collection of Praagams after the Parinirvana of Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira. Five readings have been done for the collection of Praagams. The first reading - 160 years after the Nirvana of Veer, in Pataliputra. A severe famine of twelve years fell and the Shruta became fragmented. Many Bahushratadhar Shramanas perished in the jaws of time. Many other obstacles also created obstacles in the proper transmission of sutras. The beads of Praagam knowledge became scattered. After the famine ended, the distinguished Acharyas who were present at that time gathered in Pataliputra. A systematic collection of eleven Angas was done. The only knower of the twelfth Dristivad, Bhadrabahu Swami, was practicing Mahapran-Dhyan in Nepal at that time. At the request of the Sangha, he agreed to give the reading of the twelfth Anga. Muni Sthulabhadra received the reading with prayers till the tenth Purva. The reading of the eleventh Purva was going on when Muni Sthulabhadra showed a miracle to the sisters by taking the form of a lion. Due to which Bhadrabahu stopped giving further readings. After that, at the repeated persuasion of the Sangha and Sthulabhadra, Bhadrabahu gave the reading of the last four Purvas from the original, not from the meaning. From the literal point of view, Sthulabhadra became fourteen Purvi, but from the point of view of meaning, he remained ten Purvi. 1.

The second attempt to compile the second *vachana-pragam* took place in the middle of the 2nd century BCE. Emperor Kharavela was a devout follower of Jainism. His famous *Hathigumpha* inscription proves that he had called a congregation of Jain monks on the Kumari mountain in Odisha and had revived the *angas* that had been forgotten during the Mauryan period. The Sanskrit-Prakrit mixed *pattavali* called *Himvant Theravali* also clearly mentions that Maharaja Kharavela had revived the *pravacana*.

The third attempt to compile the *pragams* of the third *vachana* took place between 827 and 840 CE. At that time, a severe twelve-year famine made it difficult for the monks to receive alms. The situation of the *shraman* community became critical. Young monks traveled far and wide in search of pure food. Many elderly and learned monks died due to the effects of food deprivation. How could the monks engage in study, teaching, memorization, and recitation while suffering from hunger? All activities were disrupted. Gradually, the *shruta* began to decline. The *shruta* was almost completely lost. A large part of the *anga* and *upaanga* literature was also lost in terms of meaning. After the famine ended, the *shraman* community gathered in Mathura under the leadership of *Skandilācārya*. They compiled a portion of the *kalika shruta* and the *purvagata shruta* based on whatever they could remember. This *vachana* was completed in Mathura and became known as the *Mathuri Vachana*. *Acharya Skandil* provided the meaning of the compiled *shruta*, so this *anuyoga* came to be known as the *Skandilī Vachana*. According to the *Chandi* and *Vatti* of the *Nandi Sutta*, except for a small amount of *shruta-jnana*, all the *anuyoga-dhara* monks had passed away due to the famine. To this end, *Acharya Skandil* revived the *anuyoga*, which led to this *vachana* being called the *Mathuri Vachana*, and the entire *anuyoga* being considered related to *Skandil*.

The fourth *vachana* took place in Vallabhi (Saurashtra) under the leadership of *Acharya Nagarjuna* during the same time that the monks who were wandering in the north, east, and central India were gathering in Mathura. However, the monks who gathered there had forgotten a lot of the *shruta*. They compiled whatever they could remember. This *vachana* is known as the *Vallabhi Vachana* or the *Nagarjuniya Vachana*.

The fifth *vachana* took place in Vallabhi again in the 10th century CE (980 or 993 CE, 454-466 CE) under the leadership of *Devaddigni Shramashraman*. *Devaddigni* 1. Journal of the Bihar and Orissa Research Society Vol. 13 p. 336 2. *Jainasahitya ka Vrihad Itihas* Vol. 1 p. 52. 3. *Praavashyak Churni*. 4. *Nandi Chuni* p. 8, *Nandi Gatha* 33, *Malayagiri Vritti* / *Kahavali*. Believing that the *Jinavachana* was almost extinct due to the famine, *Bhagavan* - *Nagarjuna*, *Skandilācārya*, and others - preserved it in books. *Yogashastra*, p. 3, p. 207.

They were knowledgeable in the **Adik Sutra**. Due to various reasons like weakness of memory, lack of reflection, decline in patience, and disruption of tradition, a large part of the **Shruta literature** was lost. An attempt was made to collect and preserve the forgotten **Shruta**. **Devadhigani**, with his sharp intellect, compiled and put it in writing. An attempt was made to harmonize the two readings, **Mathuri** and **Vallabhi**, and bring them into uniformity. Where there was a lot of disagreement, the **Mathuri reading** was given precedence, and the readings of the **Vallabhi reading** were placed in the **variant readings**. This is why in the commentaries on the **Pragamas**, we find instructions like "**Nagārjunīyāstu paṭhanti**" here and there. While putting the **Agamas** in writing, **Devadhigani** kept some key points in mind. Where there are similar passages in the **Pragamas**, instead of repeating them, he has given directions for a specific text or place, such as "**Jaha Uvvaie, Jaha Paṇṇavaṇāe**". If the same thing appears multiple times in a single **Pragam**, the word "**Jāv**" has been used to indicate the last word, such as "**Nāgakumārā Jāv Viharamti**" **Teṇa Kāleṇaṁ Jāv Parisā Niggayā**. In addition to this, some of the main events after **Lord Mahavira** were also included in the **Pragamas**. Since this reading took place in **Vallabhi**, it is called the "**Vallabhi Reading**". After this, there was no universally accepted reading of the **Bhagams**. After the tenth century of **Vīranirvāṇa**, the tradition of **Pūrvajñāna** was disrupted. Due to this method, although a large part of the **Pragam literature** was lost, some of the original parts of the **Agamas** are still preserved today. The question may arise, why is the **Jain Shragam literature** not fully available like the **Vedic literature**? Why did it become disrupted? The main reason for this is that the **Agam literature** was not written before **Devadhigani's** **Kshamasraman**. It continued in the form of **Shruti**. Due to the lack of a capable and talented disciple, the guru did not impart that knowledge to the disciple, due to which the **Shruta literature** gradually became forgotten. Despite all this, the **Shruta literature** available today is also very important. In it, the words of **Prabhu Mahavira** are still available in many of its parts. This is not a matter of little glory. The subject matter of **Jīvābhigam** - This **Pragam** has nine **pratipattis** (chapters). The first **pratipatti** describes **Jīvābhigam** and **Ajīvābhigam**. The word **abhigam** means **section** or **knowledge**. **Ātmatattva** - In this infinite **lokaākāśa** or in the entire universe, whatever is animate or inanimate, visible or invisible, or any particular object or substance, is all included in these two terms - **Jīva** or **Ajīva**. The fundamental elements are **Jīva** and **Ajīva**. The rest - **pūṇya-pāpa, pāsa-saṁvara, nirjarā, bandha**, and **mokṣa** - are merely the culmination of the combination and separation of these two elements. Other **āstika** philosophies have also accepted these two fundamental elements in the same way. **Vedanta** has considered them as **Brahma** and **Māyā**. **Sāṅkhya** has considered them as **Purusha** and **Prakriti**, and **Buddhists** have considered them as **vijñānaghana** and **vāsanā**. 1. **Vallahipurammi Nayare Devadhipamuheṇa Samaṇasandheṇa** / **Putthai Āgamo Lihiyo Navasayanasiprāno Vavīrāno**. 2. **Jadiṣṭhaṁ Naṁ Loge Taṁ Savaṁ Dupodopārāṁ, Taṁ Jaha-Jīvacceva Ajībacceva** / - **Stānanaga Dvitīya Stāna**

As the Vedic philosophy has recognized the same thing as the principle of the soul and the principle of matter. In short, it can be said that the foundation of the Astika philosophies is soulism. Jainism, in particular, has discussed the principle of the soul in great detail with great subtlety. The stream of Jain thought originates from the soul and ends in liberation. The beginning of the Praacharaang Sutra is from the inquiry of the soul. In its first sentence, it is said, "In this world, many beings do not know from which direction their soul has come and where it will go? They also do not know whether their soul will transmigrate in the next birth or not? Who was I in the previous birth and what will I become after death in the next birth - they do not know this either." From this inquiry of the soul, religion and philosophy have originated. The beginning of the Vedanta philosophy is also from the Brahma Sutra's "Athaato Brahma Jijnasa". Although the Vedas have a lot of provisions for yajnas and praise of Indra and other gods for material prosperity, but in the later Upanishads and Aranyakas, there has been a deep contemplation and description of the principle of the soul. The voice of the sages of the Upanishads came out - "The soul is to be seen, heard, contemplated and meditated upon." This stream of thought, which began with the inquiry of the soul, gradually developed, flowed in thousands of streams and finally merged into the ocean of immortality and liberation. In the Upanishads, Maitreyi asks Yajnavalkya, "What should I do with that which does not make me immortal? Tell me that which is the means of immortality." According to Jain thinkers, the ultimate destination of every soul is liberation. All practices and worship are for the attainment of liberation. The goal of all soul seekers is to attain liberation, therefore, those seekers are called "Mumukshu". From the beginning to the attainment of liberation, the soul's fulfillment and meaning lies in the pursuit of excellence, and this is the achievement. Therefore, in the nine principles accepted by Jain philosophy, the first principle is the soul and the last principle is liberation. The principles in between are related to the various processes of the non-soul karmic elements that bind the soul due to its potential and transformation. The group of pudgalas that gives happiness is the principle of punya. The principle that gives sorrow and hinders knowledge etc. is sin. The soul's impure tendency is asrava. To stop this impure tendency is samvara. The partial depletion of the karmic covering is nirjara. The binding of karmic pudgalas with the soul is the principle of bandha. The complete depletion of the karmic coverings is liberation. As long as the soul remains in the potential state, it becomes bound by the non-soul pudgalic karmic groups. As a result, it has to be bound in the bondage of the body. It has to go from one body to another. In this way, the tradition of taking and leaving the body continues. This tradition is birth and death. The soul in the potential state keeps wandering in this cycle of birth and death. This is the world. All the religious and spiritual efforts of the souls in the potential state are to break this tradition of birth and death. The soul is proved by self-awareness, direct perception and inference etc. Every living being has the self-awareness of "I am". No one doubts their own existence. "I am happy" or "I am sad" - this is self-awareness. 1. "In this world, many beings do not know from which direction their soul has come and where it will go? They also do not know whether their soul will transmigrate in the next birth or not? Who was I in the previous birth and what will I become after death in the next birth - they do not know this either." - Praacharaang 1-1 2. "The soul is to be seen, heard, contemplated and meditated upon." - Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2-4-5 // 3. "What should I do with that which does not make me immortal? Tell me that which is the means of immortality." - Brihadaranyaka Upanishad [19] 

Page #22:
---------------------------
"I am unhappy" - the "I" in this perception is the proof of the soul's direct experience. This "Aham Pratyay" is the indicator of the soul's existence. The soul is directly experienced because its knowledge quality is self-evident. Just as things like pots and pans are considered directly experienced because their qualities like form and color are directly experienced, similarly, the soul is directly experienced because its knowledge quality is directly experienced. The soul exists because its extraordinary quality of consciousness is observed. Whatever has an extraordinary quality that is observed, its existence is certain, like the eye. The eye, being subtle, is not directly visible, but its existence is inferred from its power to produce the knowledge of form, which is not produced by other senses. Similarly, the soul is inferred from its consciousness quality, which is not found in inanimate objects. The Bhagavati Sutra states: "Gautama! If there were no soul, who would rise? Who would perform actions, strength, vigor, and effort? These actions, strength, vigor, and effort are the manifestation of the soul's existence. Who acts with knowledge? Acting and refraining with knowledge are also manifestations of the soul's existence." The passage in the Bhagavati Sutra that describes the actions of pudgala is also very thought-provoking. It states: "Gautama! If there were no pudgala, from what would the body be formed? Who would be the cause of the divisions? From what would the changing body be formed? Who would perform the functions of heat, digestion, and illumination? Who would be the means of experiencing pleasure and pain and delusion? How would sound, form, smell, taste, touch, and their respective organs - ears, eyes, nose, tongue, and skin - be formed? Who would be the cause of mind, speech, and pulsation? Whose are the inhalation and exhalation? If there were no darkness and light, no food and movement, no sun and shade, who would be small, who would be big? Who would be long, who would be wide? If there were no triangles and quadrilaterals, no circles and spheres, no conjunction and disjunction, no pleasure and pain, no life and death, this world would be invisible." From the above quote from the Bhagavati Sutra, it becomes clear that the worldly soul, afflicted by the karmic pudgalas, is associated with them like milk and water. There is a close relationship between the soul and the body. It is through this association that various activities occur. Food, breathing, senses, language, and mind are neither the qualities of the soul nor of the pudgala. They are the result of association - arising from the association of the soul and the body. Hunger is not felt by the soul nor by the body without the soul. The desire for enjoyment and consumption is not in the soul nor in the body without the soul. The union of the soul and the body is worldly life. As a result of the various consequences of actions, the worldly soul attains various forms. Sometimes it is born in a stationary form, sometimes in a mobile form. Sometimes it becomes one-sensed, sometimes two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, and sometimes five-sensed. Sometimes it is born as a woman, sometimes as a man, and sometimes as a eunuch. Sometimes it is born as an animal or bird, sometimes as a human, and sometimes it is born in the heavenly realm. It is born and dies in eighty-four lakh species and families, and it suffers from various circumstances. Jain scholars have described these various states of the soul in a very subtle and detailed manner. 1. Bhagavati Shatak 13 U. 4, Su. 2-10 / 2. Bhagavati Shatak 13 U. 4 / [20] 

Page #23:
---------------------------
The concept of Jivaabhigam has been explored from various dimensions. By classifying it in various ways from different perspectives, the scholars have provided abundant information about the essence of the soul. The same is compiled in the nine propositions of Jivaabhigam. 

The first proposition states that the venerable Bhagavants have revealed the knowledge of Jivaabhigam and Ajivaabhigam according to the teachings of the omniscient and all-seeing Tirthankara. Before explaining the Palpavaktavya, it is mentioned that Ajivaabhigam is of two types - Rupee Ajivaabhigam and Praroopee Ajivaabhigam. 

Ten types of Aroopee Ajivaabhigam are mentioned - the Skandha, Desh, and Pradesh of Dharmaastikaya, the Skandha, Desh, and Pradesh of Adharmaastikaya, the Skandha, Desh, and Pradesh of Aakaashaastikaya, and Pradhaasamya (time). According to Jain principles, Dharmaastikaya etc. are the elements that help in motion, and Adharma is the element that helps in stillness. 

Aakash and Kaal have been accepted by other philosophers as well, but Dharmaastikaya and Adharmaastikaya have not been accepted by anyone except Jain philosophy. This is a completely original concept of Jain philosophy. 

Behind this original concept is a strong foundation of evidence and logic. Jain Acharyas have proved through logic that there must be a regulatory element for the arrangement of Lok and Alok. 

Jiva and Pudgal, which are dynamic, move only in Lok, not in Alok. There must be some regulatory element for this. Otherwise, if Jiva and Pudgal were to move in the infinite Alokakash, the situation of instability would arise, and the entire Lokavyavastha would be shattered. Therefore, Jain thinkers have accepted the existence of Dharma as the element that regulates motion and Adharma as the element that regulates stillness. 

Modern science has also accepted the element that helps in motion (Medium of Motion). Newton and Einstein have established the element of motion. Ether, accepted by scientists, is another name for the element of motion. 

Lok is finite. Alok beyond Lok is infinite. The reason for Lok being finite is that Dravya or Shakti cannot go beyond Lok. Beyond Lok, there is the influence of that Shakti which helps in motion. 

Lord Mahavira has said that all the vibrations happen with the help of Dharma. If Dharma Tattva did not exist, who would go? Who would come? How would sound waves spread? How would eyes open? Who would contemplate? Who would speak? Who would move? This world would be immobile. 

Dharma, the element that helps in motion, is the cause of all that moves. Similarly, if Adharma, the element that helps in stillness, did not exist, who would be able to stop while moving? Who would sit? How would one sleep? Who would become motionless? How would a blink happen? This world would always be moving. Adharma-Adharmaastikaya, the element that helps in stillness, is the support for all that is static in motion. 

In this way, Jain thinkers have presented a completely original concept in the form of Dharma and Adharma. All philosophers have accepted the existence of Aakash. If Aakash did not exist, where would Jiva and Pudgal reside? Where would Dharmaastikaya and Adharmaastikaya be present? Where would Kaal be layered? Where would the stage of Pudgal be created? This world would be baseless. 

Kaal is a formal Dravya. From the perspective of Nishchayanaya, Kaal is a synonym for Jiva and Ajiva. But from the perspective of Vyavahar Nay, it is Dravya. Because its benefits are like Vartana etc. What is beneficial is Dravya. 

Page #24:
---------------------------
The behavior that is exhibited for the limits of the states of substances, etc., is not different from them because it is a synonym of the soul, time, and form, etc. There are four types of non-living beings: skandha, desha, pradesha, and paramanu pudgala. This pudgala dravya is concrete. It is not a solid substance. Its smallest form is a paramanu, and its largest form is the machitta, where combination-separation, small-large, light-heavy, color, smell, taste, touch, and structure are found. Jain theory considers light, darkness, shadow, falling leaves, and sound to be pudgalic. Considering sound to be pudgalic is indicative of the subtle vision of Jain philosophy. The Nyaya-Vaisheshika philosophy considers sound to be a quality of light. Today's science has clarified the pudgalic nature of sound. In an era when modern scientific instruments were not available, Jain thinkers called sound pudgalic and also said that our sound becomes ubiquitous in a moment. Even without a connection to a wire, the sound of a loud bell resonates in countless yojanas away from other bells - this is a discussion from a time when radio, wireless, etc. were not researched. After describing the non-living beings in this way, the statement of living beings is presented. Two distinctions have been made in the pure and impure nature of the soul: the world-ending soul and the non-world-ending soul. Those souls who have attained their pure form by performing the excellent worship of their knowledge, vision, and character are non-world-ending souls. They do not return to the world. Jain theory believes that just as a seed cannot sprout after being burned, similarly, after the burning of the karma-like seed, the whirlpool-like sprout cannot blossom. Jain philosophy does not believe in avatarism like Buddhist or Vedic philosophy. It is an evolutionary philosophy. The world-bound soul develops and becomes a perfected soul, and then it does not return to the world. The world-ending souls are those who, being afflicted by the state of being devoid of liberation, carry the complexities of karma-bondage and attain various worldly bodies, senses, yogas, uses, leshyas, vedas, etc. This is the impure state of the soul. The perfected state is the pure state of the soul, and the world-bound embodied state is the impure state of the soul. The soul is pure in its original form, but it cannot be said when it became impure. Just as the lineage of the egg and the hen is eternal, it cannot be said whether the egg came first or the hen? Similarly, it cannot be said when the world-bound soul became impure. The relationship between the soul and karma has been going on since time immemorial, therefore, the soul has been in an impure state since time immemorial. Its goal is to attain purity from this impure state, and all practices and worship are for that purpose. The Sankhya philosophy believes that the soul is pure. It does not become impure. It is neither bound nor liberated. Binding and liberation are of nature, the soul is eternal, inactive, and attributeless. Just as a dancer retires after showing her dance on stage, similarly, nature retires after completing its work - this separation of the soul and nature is liberation. This belief of Sankhya philosophy is one-sided and incomplete. If the soul is pure and eternal, then what is the purpose of practice and worship? The need for practice arises only when the soul is impure. 

Page #25:
---------------------------
From the Jain perspective, a liberated soul is a pure soul, while a soul bound to a body is impure. The combination of soul and karma particles in a body-bound soul is the reason for the soul's impure states. Due to these impure states, Jain doctrine considers the soul to be ever-changing. It is neither eternally permanent nor eternally impermanent, but rather eternally permanent in its essence while impermanent in its states. The Buddhist philosophy, which considers the soul to be eternally impermanent, is a one-sided and incomplete view. If the soul is considered to be eternally fleeting, then bondage, liberation, and other such events cannot occur. In such a situation, their accepted theories of karma and rebirth would also not occur. Buddhist philosophy is actually unclear about the soul. On the one hand, it is nihilistic, while on the other hand, it accepts rebirth and karma. Jain philosophy is very clear about the soul. It considers the soul to be eternally permanent and impermanent from the perspective of the doctrine of non-absolutism. It accepts that the soul experiences bondage and liberation. Even though it considers the soul to be formless, it also considers the worldly soul to be somewhat form-bound. The worldly soul possesses a body, perceives objects through the senses, and is characterized by food, breathing, speech, and mind. Due to these transformations, the soul is considered to be somewhat form-bound. All the activities of worldly beings are due to the combination of soul and body, and therefore they are composite. These actions cannot occur in the soul alone, nor are they possible in the body alone. 

The nine-fold view describes the distinctions of the world-ending beings through nine types of beliefs. According to the first belief, there are two types of worldly beings: non-stationary and stationary. According to the second belief, there are three types: female, male, and neuter. According to the third belief, there are four types of worldly beings: hell-being, animal, human, and god. According to the fourth belief, there are five types: one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, and five-sensed. According to the fifth belief, there are six types of worldly beings: earth-bodied, water-bodied, fire-bodied, air-bodied, plant-bodied, and sky-bodied. According to the sixth belief, there are seven types of worldly beings: hell-being, animal, female animal, human, luminous being, god, and goddess. According to the seventh belief, there are eight types of worldly beings: first-time hell-being, non-first-time hell-being, first-time animal, non-first-time animal, first-time human, non-first-time human, first-time god, and non-first-time god. According to the eighth belief, there are nine types of worldly beings: earth-bodied, water-bodied, fire-bodied, air-bodied, plant-bodied, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, and five-sensed. According to the ninth belief, there are ten types of worldly beings: five types from first-time one-sensed to first-time five-sensed, and five types from non-first-time one-sensed to non-first-time five-sensed, making a total of ten types of worldly beings. 

All the aforementioned beliefs appear to be distinct, but there is no contradiction in them from a philosophical perspective. The same object appears different from different perspectives, but there is no contradiction. There are different classifications and representations, but all the aforementioned beliefs are non-contradictory. This is the characteristic of the doctrine of non-absolutism. [23]

---------------------------
According to the first principle of Asatva and Sthavarattva, there are two categories of worldly beings - Sa and Sthavar. Sthavar is further divided into three categories - Prithvikaayik, Apkaayik and Vanaspatikaayik. Sa is also divided into three categories - Tejaskaayik, Vaayukaayik and Udar Tras. Jain Tirthankaras, through their pure and immaculate Kevalgyan, have observed and examined the beings of the world in detail. Therefore, they are 'Sayya Jagajivjooniviyaanak', the knowers of all the species of beings in the world. They have not only acknowledged the existence of beings that are visible and mobile, but have also recognized and categorized the presence of beings in earth, water, fire, air and plants. Such a description and understanding is not found anywhere else except in Jain principles. Jain Tattva thinkers clearly instruct that there are beings in earth and other elements, and a non-violent practitioner should strive to protect these subtle beings just as they protect terrestrial creatures. The worship of the goddess of non-violence is not complete by protecting only humans or animals, but one should also aim to be completely non-violent towards beings with consciousness in earth, water, fire, air and plants. While explaining the existence of beings in Prithvikaayadi, the scholars have stated that the emergence and bondage of six types of karmas - Upayog, Yog, Adhyavasaya, Matishrutgyan, Achakstudarshan, Prashta - as well as Leshya, Sanjna, Shwasochchwas and Kashay, which are qualities found in beings, are also found in Prithvikaayadi. Therefore, like humans, Prithvikaayadi should also be considered as sentient beings. Although the above-mentioned characteristics are latent in Prithvikaayadi, their existence cannot be denied due to their latent nature. To clarify this, an example is given: If a man consumes a large amount of intoxicating liquor and becomes unconscious due to it, his consciousness becomes latent, but he cannot be called unconscious just because of that. Similarly, the power of consciousness is latent in Prithvikaayadi, but it cannot be denied. Prithvikaayadi, being one-sensed beings, do not have ears, eyes, nose, tongue, speech and mind, so the question arises as to how they experience pain. This is answered in the Praacharaang Sutra with an example: If a blind, deaf, lame and disabled person is pierced with a weapon in their feet, ankles, calves, knees, thighs, waist, navel, stomach, ribs, back, chest, arms, fingers, nails, neck, beard, lips, teeth, tongue, palate, cheeks, ears, nose, eyes, eyebrows, forehead, head, etc., they will feel pain, but they cannot express it. Similarly, one-sensed Prithvikaayadi beings experience latent pain. Just as a person in an unconscious state feels pain if someone hurts them, so should the pain of Prithvikaayadi beings be understood. Great scholars have proven the consciousness in one-sensed beings through various arguments. The consciousness of plants is even more evident. In the Visheshaavashyak Bhashya and other texts, it is proven with strong and solid evidence that they have clear consciousness. While comparing plants to the female body, the Praacharaang Sutra states that plants are like the human body in terms of birth, nature, growth, consciousness, wilting when cut, they need nourishment, and they experience changes. Therefore, like the human body, plants are also conscious. [24] 

Page #27:
---------------------------
The science of प्राधनिक has also proven the consciousness of plants. It has been demonstrated through scientific means that plants experience emotions like anger, happiness, laughter, attachment, etc. For example, plants have been observed to show laughter and anger when criticized. In the presented argument, two categories of worldly beings have been made: त्रस and स्थावर. While explaining the origin of त्रस, the commentary states that beings who, due to heat and other factors, move from one place to another in search of shade, etc., are त्रस. According to this derivation, only those beings who have the उदय of the अस नामकर्म are considered त्रस, not the others. However, here, beings with the उदय of the स्थावर नामकर्म, namely तेजस्काय and वायुकाय, are also called अस. Therefore, the derivation of अस should be done in this way: those who move upwards, downwards, or sideways, with or without intention, are अस, such as तेजस्काय, वायुकाय, and द्वीन्द्रिय, etc. Those who cannot leave their place even when subjected to heat and other factors, and remain there, are स्थावर beings, such as earth, water, and plants. Generally, earth, water, fire, air, and plants are considered as the five स्थावर. This is the statement in प्राचारांग. But here, considering motion, तेजस् and वायु are called अस. Because the upward movement of fire and the sideways movement of air are well-known. Reconciling both statements, it is said that अस beings are of two types: गतित्रस and लब्धित्रस. तेजस् and वायु are only गतित्रस, not लब्धित्रस. Those who have the उदय of the त्रस नामकर्म, which is a form of लब्धि, are लब्धित्रस, such as द्वीन्द्रिय, etc., who are उदार अस. Since तेजस् and वायु do not have this लब्धि, they are not लब्धित्रस and are categorized as स्थावर. They are categorized as त्रस here only in terms of motion. Two categories of पृथ्वीकाय have been made: सूक्ष्म पृथ्वीकाय and बादर पृथ्वीकाय. Two categories of सूक्ष्म पृथ्वीकाय have been mentioned: पर्याप्तक and अपर्याप्तक. Subsequently, to provide detailed information about सूक्ष्म पृथ्वीकायिक beings, they have been described through 23 द्वार. These 23 द्वार are: शरीर, प्रवगाहना, संहनन, संस्थान, कषाय, संज्ञा, लेश्या, इन्द्रियां, समुद्धात, संजी-प्रसंज्ञी, वेद, पर्याप्ति-अपर्याप्ति, दृष्टि, दर्शन, ज्ञान, योग, उपयोग, पाहार, उपपात, स्थिति, समुद्घात करके मरण, च्यवन, गति, and प्रागति. It is asked as a question: "O Bhagavan! How many bodies do those सूक्ष्म पृथ्वीकायिक beings have?" The answer is given that they have three bodies: औदारिक, तेजस्, and कार्मण. In this way, questions and answers have been given regarding the remaining द्वार.

In the same way, two types of Badar Prithvikaaya are mentioned - Shlakshna Badar Prithvikaaya and Kharabadar Prithvikaaya. Seven types of Shlakshna Prithvikaaya and many types of Kharabadar Prithvikaaya are mentioned. Then, by differentiating them as sufficient and insufficient, the aforementioned 23 doors are reduced. Subsequently, the subtle and Badar, sufficient and insufficient types of Apkaaya are differentiated and their description is given from the aforementioned 23 doors. Thereafter, the subtle and Badar, sufficient and insufficient types of Vanaspatikaaya are differentiated and the aforementioned doors are reduced. Subsequently, two types of Badar Vanaspati are mentioned - each body Badar Vanaspati and ordinary body Badar Vanaspati. The differences and sub-differences of these are mentioned. Twelve types of each body Badar Vanaspati are mentioned - tree, cluster, herb, creeper, vine, mountain, grass, ring, green, medicine, aquatic plant and cave. Subsequently, many types of ordinary body Badar Vanaspati are mentioned. The aforementioned 23 doors are reduced in all these types. Three types of Tejaskaaya, Vayukaaya and Udara Tras are mentioned for all living beings. The subtle and Badar types of Tejaskaaya and Vayukaaya are mentioned, then many types of Badar are mentioned. Four types of Udara Tras are mentioned - two-sense, three-sense, four-sense and five-sense. Four types of five-sense are mentioned - hell, animal, human and god. Seven types of hell are mentioned based on the foundation of the earth like Ratna Prabhaadi, three types of animal are mentioned - aquatic, terrestrial and aerial, then many types of each are mentioned. Two types of human are mentioned - Sammoochim and Garmootpanna. Four types of god are mentioned - Bhavanpati, Vyantar, Jyotishka and Vaimanika. The aforementioned 23 doors are reduced in all the differences and sub-differences of the aforementioned living beings. The definition and explanation of all the aforementioned doors have been done by the learned translator and commentator Muni Shri at the appropriate place, which is very useful for the inquisitive. The inquisitive people should see there. Mentioning them here will only be repetition, therefore, only the subject is mentioned. In the second understanding of the presented sutra, all the worldly living beings are divided into three divisions based on the Veda. Those divisions are - female, male and neuter. Three types of females are mentioned - 1. Animal-born females, human females and god females. Hell beings are only those who have neuter Veda, therefore, they do not have female or male Veda. Three types of animal-born females are mentioned - aquatic, terrestrial and aerial. Then, their further differences are mentioned. Three types of human females are mentioned - those born in the land of karma, those born in the land of no karma and those born in the end islands. Twenty-eight types of end island females, thirty types of no karma land females and fifteen types of karma land females are mentioned. Four types of god females are mentioned - Bhavanvaasi god females, Vanavyantar god females, Jyotishkadev females and Vaimanika god females. Subsequently, their further differences are mentioned. Vaimanika god females are only in two heavenly realms - Saudharma and Ishana. There are no female gods in the further heavenly realms. After describing the differences of females, their situation is mentioned. First, the situation of the inferior and superior is mentioned in general, then the inferior and superior situation of each is mentioned by taking their further differences. The proof of the situation should be known from the original text and translation. [ 26 ]

After describing the state of a woman, the duration of her "sunchiththana" is explained. "Sunchiththana" refers to the period for which a woman can remain in her female form continuously (without leaving her "stree-swa"). The duration of "sunchiththana" is explained for a normal woman and then for each "uttarabhed" (sub-category). This information should be understood from both the original text and the translation. 

Following the "sunchiththana" period, the "antar" (interval) is described. "Antar" refers to the period after a woman leaves her female form and before she becomes a woman again. The "antar" period is explained for a normal woman and for each "uttarabhed" woman.

After the "antar" comes the description of "alp-bahutva" (lesser-greater). "Alp-bahutva" means to explain the relative abundance or scarcity of something. This "alp-bahutva" is explained in relation to different categories: "tiryak-stri" (animal women), "manushya-stri" (human women), and "deva-stri" (divine women). The least numerous are human women, animal women are many times more numerous, and divine women are countless times more numerous.

Following this, the "alp-bahutva" of "stree-ved" (female karma) is explained. It is said that the minimum "stree-ved" is one-and-a-half sevenths of half a "sagaropama" (ocean-like) minus an "uncountable" number of "palya-upama" (atom-like) parts, and the maximum is fifteen "koti-koti" (billions of billions) "sagaropama". Fifteen hundred years is the "abada-kal" (uninterrupted period), and the "karma-nisheka" (experiencing period) is the period without "abada-kal". The period after the binding of karma until its manifestation is called "abada-kal". The period when the "karma-dalik" (karma particle) enters the "udaya-avali" (manifestation stream) is called "karma-nisheka". 

Then, "stree-ved" is compared to "kumfuma-agni" (glowing embers). Just as the embers of a fire burn slowly and last for a long time, the experience of "stree-ved" is slow and long-lasting.

After the explanation of "stree-ved", the description of "purusha-ved" (male karma) follows. The different categories of men are described, and their state, "sunchiththana", "antar", and "alp-bahutva" are explained. Then, the binding state, "abada-kal", and "karma-nisheka" of "purusha-ved" are explained, and "purusha-ved" is compared to the flames of a "dava-agni" (forest fire).

In the description of "napunsak-ved" (eunuch karma), it is said that eunuchs are of three types: "narayik-napunsak" (male-like eunuch), "tiryak-yonik-napunsak" (animal-born eunuch), and "manushya-yonik-napunsak" (human-born eunuch). There are no divine eunuchs. Then, their different categories are described. Following this, their state, "sunchiththana", "antar", "alp-bahutva", binding state, "abada-kal", and "karma-nisheka" are explained. "Napunsak-ved" is compared to a "mahanagar-daha" (great city fire).

Then, the "alp-bahutva" of the "vedas" (karmas) is explained in terms of their types. It is said that men are the least numerous, women are many times more numerous than men, and eunuchs are countless times more numerous than women. Animal-born women are three times more numerous than animal-born men. Human women are twenty-seven times more numerous than human men, and divine women are thirty-two times more numerous than divine men. 

"1. Three times more are the animal women than the animal men, it should be known. 
2. Twenty-seven times more are the human women than the human men. 
3. Thirty-two times more are the divine women than the divine men, as declared by the Jinas, due to the attachment and aversion." - Sangrahani-gatha [27]

## The Third Rebirth: Description of Hell

If the beings of the world are divided into four parts, their division is as follows: Narayika, Tiryanchika, Manushya, and Deva. 

Narayika beings reside in seven types of hells. These hells are below the Madhyaloka (middle world). They are called Narakprithvi (hell-earths). Their names are: Ghamma, Vansha, Sela, Anjana, Rishta, Magha, and Maghavati. 

These have seven gotras (lineages): Ratnaprabha, Sharkaraprabha, Balukaprabha, Pankaprabha, Dhoomaprabha, Tamahprabha, and Tamtamahprabha. 

The thickness of the Ratnaprabha earth is one lakh eighty thousand yojanas, Sharkaraprabha is one lakh thirty-two thousand yojanas, Balukaprabha is one lakh twenty-eight thousand yojanas, Pankaprabha is one lakh twenty thousand yojanas, Dhoomaprabha is one lakh eighteen thousand yojanas, Tamahprabha is one lakh sixteen thousand yojanas, and Tamtamahprabha is one lakh eight thousand yojanas. 

The Ratnaprabha earth has three divisions (kanda): Khar Kanda (also called Ratna Kanda), Pank Kanda, and Prapabahul Kanda. Only the Ratnaprabha earth has these kanda; the rest are uniform. 

In the Ratnaprabha earth, excluding one thousand yojanas above and below, there are seven crore seventy-two lakh mansions of the Bhavanavasi Devas above and thirty lakh Narakavasa (hell-dwellings) below. 

In the second Narakprithvi, excluding one thousand yojanas above and below, there are twenty-five lakh Narakavasa. Similarly, in the third earth, there are fifteen lakh, in the fourth ten lakh, in the fifth three lakh, in the sixth one lakh minus five, and in the seventh five Narakavasa. 

Below the Ratnaprabha earth, after an immeasurable distance of yojanas, lies the second earth, Sharkaraprabha. Below this, at an immeasurable distance of thousands of yojanas, lies the Balukaprabha earth. The bottom of this third earth is two raju lower than the Madhyaloka. 

Below the third earth, at an immeasurable distance of thousands of yojanas, lies the fourth earth, Pankaprabha. The bottom of this earth is three raju lower than the Madhyaloka. Below this, at an immeasurable distance of thousands of yojanas, lies the fifth earth, Dhoomaprabha. Its bottom is four raju lower. 

Below the fifth earth, at an immeasurable distance of thousands of yojanas, lies the sixth earth, Tamahprabha. Its bottom is five raju lower than the Madhyaloka. Below the sixth earth, at an immeasurable distance of thousands of yojanas, lies the seventh earth, Tamtamahprabha. Its bottom is six raju lower than the Madhyaloka. 

Below the seventh earth, there is an area one raju thick and seven raju wide where only Ekendriya beings reside. 

These Ratnaprabha, etc., earths are based on Ghanodadhi, Dhanavat, and Tanuvat. Below them is Avakashantar (polar). 

In the seven hells and their Avakashantar, there is a widespread presence of pudgal dravyas (matter). 

The shape of all the earths from Ratnaprabha to Tamtamahprabha is described as similar to a Jhallari (a type of ornament). 

After that, the distance of Lokant (end of the world) is described in all four directions from the seven hells. 

All beings in the seven hells, Ratnaprabha, etc., have been born and have emerged over time, as the world is eternal. 

Ratnaprabha, etc., are both eternal and non-eternal. They are eternal in terms of dravya (substance) and non-eternal in terms of paryaya (modification). 

The establishment, dimensions, circumference, color, smell, and touch of the Narakavasa are described, highlighting their inauspiciousness. 

Regarding the four gatis (paths), the motion, progress, the pudgal of their breath, the pudgal of their food, the leshya (tendencies), knowledge, prajna (wisdom), use, avadhijna (clairvoyance), evidence, samudghat (agitation), the seven hells, the pain of hunger and thirst, the pain of cold and heat, etc., are described. 

Page #31:
---------------------------
The infernal heat is compared to the warmth of the human world, describing the undesirable karmic transformations of the hellish beings. Subsequently, the state, evolution, and devolution (origin) of the hellish beings are described.  Concluding the description of the hellish beings, it is stated that hellish beings experience extremely undesirable and inauspicious karmic transformations. Their pain, blemishes, names, lineages, retribution, fear, sorrow, hunger, thirst, diseases, breathing, mental anguish, anger, pride, delusion, greed, food, fear, sexual desire, and possessions are all inauspicious and undesirable.  Often, those with great possessions, like Vasudeva, Mandalik kings, Chakravartis, Tandal, Mastya, aquatic beings, Kalasokarik, and Kotambik (due to their great ambitions, great possessions, and karmic consequences) are destined for hell. In hell, even a moment of blinking is not a pleasure for the hellish beings. There is only suffering. There is extreme cold, extreme heat, extreme thirst, extreme hunger, and extreme fear. Hellish beings constantly experience torment.  The Tiryanchadhikar has described five types of one-sensed, two-sensed, etc., up to five-sensed beings of the Tiryancha (animal) realm. The one-sensed beings are said to be of five types: earth, water, fire, air, and vegetation.  Similarly, the distinctions and sub-distinctions of two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, and five-sensed beings are described. The five-sensed beings are said to be of two types: aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial, further divided into two sub-types: Sammuchhim and Garbhavyutkrantik.  The aerial, etc., five-sensed beings of the Nirya-yonic (non-human) realm are said to have three types of birth: Andaja (egg-born), Potaja (born from moisture), and Sammuchhim (born from a union).  Andaja and Potaja are both three-veiled beings. Sammuchhim are eunuchs. The description of these beings is given through their blemishes, vision, knowledge, understanding, yoga, use, progress, movement, state, and other aspects.  Subsequently, the concept of caste and lineage is discussed. In the second discourse, six types of beings who cycle through the realms are described: from those with an earth body to those with a breath body.  Their distinctions and sub-distinctions are made. Their state, accumulation, and purification are described.  In passing, there are questions and answers related to knowing the pure and impure blemishes of the Angara (fire) beings, and the pure and impure blemishes of the gods and goddesses.  Humans are of two types: Sammuchhim humans and Garbhavyutkrantik humans.  Sammuchhim humans are born in fourteen impure places in the realm. Their existence is only for a moment. Garbhaja (born from the womb) humans are of three types: Karmabhubhak, Akarmabhubhak, and Antipak.  The Antarvipak humans are located in the four directions of the Himalayas, three hundred yojanas (a unit of distance) within the salt ocean.  Similarly, within the salt ocean, four hundred, five hundred, six hundred, seven hundred, eight hundred, and nine hundred yojanas further, there are four Antarvipas in each direction.  Thus, there are 744-28 Antarvipas in the Chulla Himalayas.  The humans residing in these Antarvipas are called Antipak.  These Antarvipas have 28 names: 1. Ekohka, 2. Abhashik, 3. Vaishanik, 4. Nangalik, 5. Hayakarna, 6. Gajakarna, 7. Gokarna, 8. Shashkulkarna, 9. Pradarshamukha, 10. Mendamukha, 11. Ayomukha, 12. Gomukha, 13. Ashvamukha, 14. Hastimukha, 15. Singhamukha, 16. Vyaghamukha, 17. Ashvakarna, 18. Singhakarna, 19. Akarn, 20. Karnapravaran, 21. Ulkamukha, 22. Meghamukha, 23. Vidyuhant, 24. [29]

Vidyujihva, 25. Dhanadanta, 26. Lashtdant, 27. Gudhadant and 28. Shuddhadant / In the same way, there are 28 Antarvipas on the teeth of the Shikhari mountain, which are located in the salt sea. There are 56 Antarvipas in total, including both sides. The length and breadth of the Ekoruk island is three hundred yojanas and the circumference is nine hundred and fifty yojanas / It is surrounded on all sides by a Panavarvedika and a Banakhand.

Their position is an innumerable part of the Jghanya Deshon Palyopama and an innumerable part of the Utkrishta Palyopama. When they have six months of life left, the Yugalik woman gives birth to a child. These Yugalik men and women live happily and fully, and are born in the otherworldly realm. _There are houses, villages, cities, weapons, writing, agriculture, gold and silver, kings and social systems, slavery, hatred, friends, dancers, vehicles, grains, mosquitoes, war, disease, excessive rain, iron mines, buying and selling, etc. on the Ekoruk island / It is a land of enjoyment / In the same way, one should understand the description of all the Antarvipas / People who are born in Karmabhoomi are born in Karmabhoomi and people who are born in Akarmabhoomi are born in Akarmabhoomi / Karmabhoomi is where the Tirthankaras, the preachers of the path to liberation, are born, where people earn their livelihood by using weapons, writing, and agriculture / There are fifteen such Karmabhoomi - 5 Bharat, 5 Eravata and 5 Mahavideha / (These Bharat etc. are in one Jambudvipa, two Ghatakikhand and two Pushkarardh islands.) Here, people can attain liberation by destroying their karma through their efforts / They can be born in the four paths according to their own merit and demerit. Where there are no weapons, writing, or agriculture, but sustenance is provided by naturally occurring Kalpvriksha, that is Akarmabhoomi. There are 30 Akarmabhoomi - five Himavat, five Hairanyavatt, five Harivas, five Ramyakavas, five Devakuru and five Uttar Kuru / Out of these, one is in one Jambudvipa, two are in two Ghatakikhand and two are in two Pushkarardh islands. There are 30 Prakarmabhrami and 56 Antarvipas which are Bhogbhoomi. Here, there is Yugalik Dharma - Charitra Dharma is not here. [ 30 ]

After describing humans, there is a description of four types of gods: Bhavnapati, Vanavyantar, Jyotishka, and Vaimanika. / Bhavnapati and Vanavyantar gods reside in the Ratnaprabha earth, in the Madhyaloka. Jyotishka gods are also in the Madhyaloka. / Vaimanika gods reside in the Urvaloka. / There are said to be 7 crore 72 lakh Bhavnavasas in the Ratnaprabha earth, where the Bhavnavasis reside. Among them, there are ten types of Bhavnapati gods, including Asurakumar. There is a description of the mansions of the Asurakumars, the three assemblies of the Asurendra, the number of gods and goddesses in them, their position, the reason for the difference between the three assemblies, a description of the Asurakumars of the north, and a description of their assemblies. / There is also a description of the Nagakumaraendras of the south and north, and the Dharanendras of the south and north, and their three assemblies. / There is also a description of the mansions of the Vyantar gods, Indra, and the assemblies.

The commentary literature of *Jivaabhigam* is currently available in this form. No commentary or annotation has been written on *Jivaabhigam*. However, a *churni* is available as the first commentary on it, but it is unpublished. Therefore, it cannot be said clearly whether that *churni* belongs to Jinadas Ganimahattar or Sanghadas Ganimahattar. A *vritti* by Acharya Malayagiri is available in Sanskrit on *Jivaabhigam*. This *vritti* is in the form of an explanation of the verses of *Jivaabhigam*.

The presented *vritti* is in the form of an explanation of the verses of *Jivaabhigam*. This *vritti* mentions the names of many texts and authors, such as *Dharmasangrahani-toka*, *Prajnapanati-ka*, *Prajnapana-mul-tika*, *Tattvarth-mul-tika*, *Siddhpraabhrut*, *Visheshnavati*, *Jivaabhigam-mul-tika*, *Panchasangrah*, *Karma-prakriti-sangrahani*, *Kshetra-samas-tika*, *Jambu-dvip-prajnapti-toka*, *Karma-prakriti-sangrahani-churni*, *Vasudeva-charit*, *Jivaabhigamani*, *Chandra-prajnapti-tika*, *Surya-prajnapti-tika*, *Deshi-nama-mala*, *Surya-prajnapti-niyukti*, *Pancha-vastuk*, *Tattvarth-tika* by Acharya Haribhadra, *Tattvarth-bhashya*, *Visheshavashak-bhashya-svopagna-vritti*, *Panchasangrah-tika*.

Many verses from these texts have been used in the *tika*. At the beginning of the *vritti*, while shedding light on the purpose of auspiciousness, the relationship between *tantu*, *por*, and *pat* has been discussed in the verses of *Bhage*, and the nature of human settlements like *mandalik*, *mahamandalik*, *gram*, *nigam*, *khet*, *karbat*, *madamb*, *pattan*, *dronamukha*, *prakar*, *praadham*, *sambadh*, *rajadhani*, etc. has been contemplated. While contemplating the differences between the knowers in the *vritti*, it has been stated that the *Siddhpraabhrut* mentions many knowers. It has shed light on the hellish abodes in great detail and has indicated the observations of *Kshetra-samas-tika* and *Jambu-dvip-prajnapti-tika*. While contemplating the cold and hot pains of hellish beings, it has described the six seasons: *pravat*, *varsha-ratri*, *sharad*, *hemant*, *vasant*, and *grishma*. The first *sharad* has been stated to be the month of *kartik*. While contemplating the chariots of the celestial gods, it has directed the curious to see *Chandra-prajnapti*, *Surya-prajnapti*, and *Sangrahani-tika*. It also describes the eleven ornaments and gives a beautiful description of the 32 types of dramatic methods mentioned in *Rajaprashni*.

The Acharya has used the word 'vivaran' for this *vritti*, and the size of this *vivaran* is 1600 verses. [35]

The translation of *Jivaabhigam* with *Pragam-Batteesi* was done by Acharya Shri Pramolka Rishiji Maharaj. This translation is in the form of *bhavanuvad*. Later, Acharya Shri Ghasilalji Maharaj of the *Sthanakwasi* tradition wrote a detailed commentary on *Jivaabhigam* in Sanskrit. This commentary was also published in Hindi and Gujarati. In addition, *Jivaabhigam* was published in 1883 from Ahmedabad by Rai Bahadur Dhanpatsingh with *Malayagiri Vritti* and Gujarati commentary. In 1919, *Jivaabhigam* was published with *Malayagiri Vritti* by Devchand Lalbhai Pustakoddhark Fund, Bombay. However, there was a long-felt need for a Hindi publication that would be simple, easy to understand, and clearly explain the subject matter. Late Yuvacharya Shri Madhukar Muniji formed the Jan Pragam Prakashan Samiti. This committee published translations and commentaries of many *Pragams* by eminent scholars. In the same vein, this publication of *Jivaabhigam* is being released. It is a matter of great joy that the work of *Pragam-Batteesi* is almost complete in a very short time with the cooperation of many scholars. This *Pragam* is being edited by my disciple Shri Rajendra Muni. Rajendra Muni is a young monk. Earlier, he had done a beautiful editing of *Uttaraadhyaayan Sutra* and now he has shown his interest in *Pragams* by editing this unique *Pragam* of *Dravyanuyog*. The translation and commentary are capable of making the essence of the original *Pragam* clear. This edition will appeal to the minds of the people and they will enhance their knowledge by studying this *Pragam*. This is the hope. I wanted to write a detailed preface to this *Pragam* like the prefaces of previous *Pragams*, but I could not do so due to social work and a busy environment. The brief preface that is being given will help the readers to understand the importance of the *Pragam*. I have received immense grace from the most revered and glorious National Saint Acharya Samrat Shri Pranand Rishiji Maharaj and I have the blessings of the most revered and worshipful Gurudev Shri Pushkar Muniji Maharaj. It is due to the grace of these great men that I have been able to make some progress. May their grace always be with us, may we continue to achieve our spiritual excellence under their pure shade, this is the auspicious wish. Mandsaur, Dated 10-3-89 - Upadhyay Devendra Muni [36]

"The primary introductory world-benefactor, the universally revered Lord of Lords, the Tirthankara, the Supreme Being, has formulated this discourse to guide all living beings across the ocean of existence, to liberate them from worldly afflictions, diseases, and attachments, and to enable them to drink the nectar of liberation, the indescribable bliss, by freeing them from the bonds of karma that have existed since time immemorial. This discourse, being the means to ferry beings across the ocean of existence, is called a 'Tirtha'. The discourse is a Tirtha, and the Tirtha is a discourse. Because of creating this Tirtha in the form of a discourse, the Lord Arihant is called a Tirthankara. The discourse is in the form of the twelve-fold Ganipitaka. Although the discourse is timeless and infinite in its flow, it is considered the beginning for the specific Tirthankara. Therefore, by saying 'Namaste Tirthaya', even the Tirthankara, the Supreme Being, bows to the timeless and infinite Tirtha. Because of its use in the twelve-fold Ganipitaka, the four-fold order of monks is also called a Tirtha or discourse. This discourse formulated by the Tirthankara is in the form of the twelve-fold. The Lord Toयंकर, the Supreme Being, explains its meaning, and the wise Ganadharas compile it in the form of a sutra. This twelve-fold, taught by the omniscient, all-seeing Tirthankara, the Supreme Being, and compiled by the Ganadharas, the holders of fourteen previous births, is the form of the limbs of the Shruta-purusha. That which is not contradictory to this twelve-fold and is composed by the Shruta-sthaviras is the form of the limbs of the Shruta-purusha. From this perspective, Shruta literature is of two types: Anga-praveshta and Ananga-praveshta. That which is composed by the Ganadharas, which is in the form of an answer to a question, and which is fixed in the Tirtha of all Tirthankaras is called Anga-praveshta Shruta. The twelve Angas, from Pracharanga to Dastivada, are Anga-praveshta Shruta. That which is composed by the Shruta-sthaviras, which is in the form of free grammar without being asked a question, and which is not fixed in the Tirtha of all Tirthankaras is called Ananga-praveshta Shruta. For example, the twelve Upangas like Propapattika, etc., and the Mula, Chhedasutra, etc. 1. The Lord's teachings are said to be for the protection of all living beings, etc. 2. The discourse, which is comprehensive, encompassing the essence of the soul, etc., is the primary, excellent, and initial word, the twelve-fold Ganipitaka. - Visheshavashakabhashya, verse 1 commentary 3. The four-fold order of monks is also called a discourse, because of its use in the Ganipitaka, etc. - Visheshavashakabhashya, verse 1 commentary 4. The Ganadharas compile the teachings of the Lord, the Supreme Being, into a book. 5. The Ganadharas, the Therakas, or the free grammar, or the distinction between the permanent and the impermanent, or the knowledge in the Angas and the Upangas. - Visheshavashakabhashya, verse 550"

## The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigma Sutra

This Jiva-Jiva-Abhigma Sutra is the third Upanga of the Sthananga, the third Anga. It is composed by the Shruta-Sthaviras. There are two types of Anga-Bahya-Shruta: Kalika and Utkalika. Those Shruta that can be read throughout the day and night, avoiding non-study, are Utkalika, such as the Dasha-Vakalika, etc. Those that are read only in the first and last parts of the day and night are Kalika-Shruta, such as the Uttara-Adhyayana, etc. This Jiva-Jiva-Abhigma Sutra is an Utkalika Sutra.

"The study of Jiva-Jiva-Abhigma is a practice, and like the crushing of thorns and branches, a pointless practice is not for the wise. Therefore, at the beginning of the text, the purpose, the subject matter, and the connection should be explained with auspiciousness."

**1. Purpose**

Purpose is of two types: (1) Anantara-Prayojana and (2) Parampara-Prayojana.

Again, purpose is of two types: (1) Kartr-gata-Prayojana and (2) Shrotr-gata-Prayojana.

**Kartr-gata-Prayojana:** This Jiva-Jiva-Abhigma study is devoid of a doer in relation to Dravya-Athika-naya, because it is eternal, constant. The Agama says, "This Dvadasha-Anga Ganipitaka was not in the past, it is not in the present, and it will not be in the future. It is firm, constant, eternal." There is no doer of an eternal thing. In relation to Paryaya-Athika-naya, its doers are the Arhants in relation to meaning, and the Ganadharas in relation to the Sutra. The meaning-form Agama is eternal, but the Sutra-form Agama is impermanent. Therefore, the Sutra-kar's Anantara-Prayojana is to grace the beings, and the Parampara-Prayojana is to attain liberation.

Here, it can be doubted: What is the purpose of the meaning-expounding of the Arhant Bhagavan, the creator of the meaning-form Agama? They have already achieved their goal; how can purposefulness arise in them? The solution is that although the Tirthankara Paramatama have already achieved their goal, therefore purposefulness does not arise in them, yet they are engaged in meaning-expounding due to the arising of the Tirthankara-Nama-Karma. As it is said, "How is the Tirthankara-Nama-Karma experienced? By giving Dharma-Deshana with a non-lazy attitude, the Tirthankara-Nama-Karma is experienced."

[Primary Introduction] The immediate purpose of the listener is to understand the meaning of the intended study, and the ultimate purpose is to attain the state of liberation (Nishreyas). After understanding the intended meaning, the listener will be inclined towards restraint (Samyama), and through restraint, he can destroy all karmas and attain liberation. Thus, the attempt to begin this presented study is purposeful, not purposeless. / 2. Objective - The objective (subject) of the presented scripture is to expound the nature of the living (Jiva) and the non-living (Ajiva), as is evident from its name itself. The study of the living and the non-living, i.e., the knowledge of their characteristics, is called Jivajivaabhigam study. The sutrakar (author of the sutras) has adorned the presented sutra with a meaningful name. 3. Relationship - There are two types of relationships in the presented scripture: (1) Upayopeyabhava relationship and (2) Guruparvakramrupa relationship. / From the perspective of those who follow logic, there is an Upayopeyabhava relationship. / The chapters in the form of Nay (principles) and Vachan (statements) are the means (Upaya), and their knowledge is the end (Upeya). _ The Guruparvakramrupa relationship is only from the perspective of those who follow faith. From the perspective of meaning, this Jivajivaabhigam has been spoken by the Tirthankara (liberated soul), and from the perspective of the sutras, it has been spoken by the Ganadharas (disciples) in the Dvadasanga (twelve parts of Jain scriptures). / After this, for the benefit of those with dull intellect, the fourteen Purvadharas (predecessors) with extraordinary knowledge have stated and organized this Jivajivaabhigam as a separate study from the third Anga (part) called Stananga. / Therefore, it is said in the form of the third Upanga (sub-part). Considering such relationships, the sutrakar has said "Therā Bhagavanto Paṇṇavainsu". 4. Auspiciousness - The presented study is inherently auspicious because it is the cause of right knowledge (Samyagjnana) and, according to tradition, leads to liberation. However, according to "Shreyānsi Bahuvighnāni" (auspicious things are often obstructed), there is a tradition of performing auspicious rituals in the scriptures to pacify obstacles and to instill auspiciousness in the mind of the student. In adherence to this custom, auspicious invocations (Mangalacharan) are performed at the beginning, middle, and end of the text. The purpose of the initial auspicious invocation is to ensure the smooth completion of the text and to overcome obstacles encountered in the study of the scriptures. / The middle auspicious invocation is for its stability, and the final auspicious invocation is performed so that the text does not break from the student-teacher tradition. / In the presented study, the auspicious invocation is "Iha Khalu Jinamya" etc. The inscription of the name of Jin (Tirthankara) is auspicious. 1. Jīvānāmājīvānāmābhigamo Paričchedo Yasmin Tajjīvājivaabhigaman Nāmnā. 2. Tam Mangalamāīe Majjhe Pajjataye Ya Satthass. . Padhamaṃ Satthattāvigdhaparagamanaaya Niddiṣṭra.

6. The description of the nature of the **Jiva-Jiva-Migam Sutra** islands, oceans, etc. is **Madhyamangal**. Because in **Nimitta Shastra**, islands, etc. are considered to be of the highest auspiciousness. As it is said, "Whoever asks for the purpose of **Jiva-Jiva-Migam Sutra**, they will attain their desired wealth." "**Dasaviha Savve Jiva**" - this is the ultimate auspiciousness. Because it is the cause of the knowledge of all beings, it is auspicious. Or, the entire scripture itself is auspicious. Because it is the cause of **Nirjara**. Just as **Tap** is auspicious because it is the cause of **Nirjara**, scripture is auspicious because it is the form of **Samyag Jnana** and is the cause of **Nirjara**. Because it is said, "The ignorant one expiates the karmas that they have accumulated over many millions of years, while the **Gupt Jnani** expiates them in the time of a single breath, through mind, speech, and body." Thus, after describing the purpose, etc., and the auspiciousness, the study begins. 1. "The ignorant one expiates the karmas that they have accumulated over many millions of years, while the **Gupt Jnani** expiates them in the time of a single breath, through mind, speech, and body."

The First Chapter, Auspicious Introduction 1.  These venerable ones, the Theras, having contemplated, accepted, and delighted in the Jain-filled, Jain-originated, Jain-concordant, Jain-ordained, Jain-shaped, Jain-declared, Jain-approved, Jain-taught, Jain-praised, and Jain-beneficial, have formulated the study called "Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamanam" (The Interrelation of Souls). [1] In this human world, or in Jain discourse, the twelve-limbed Ganipitaka, the doctrine of the Tirthankara Supreme Being, which is approved by all other Tirthankaras, is Jain-concordant, Jain-ordained, Jain-shaped, Jain-declared, Jain-approved, Jain-taught, Jain-praised, and Jain-beneficial.  Having contemplated, accepted, and delighted in it, these venerable ones, the Theras, have formulated the study called "Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamanam" (The Interrelation of Souls).  Commentary: This first sutra, while adhering to the customary practice of auspicious invocation, introduces the treatise.  The highly intelligent, fourteen-fold-virtuous, scripture-versed, venerable ones, having thoroughly contemplated and practiced the twelve-limbed Ganipitaka, the doctrine of the Tirthankara Supreme Being, have, with faith, acceptance, and delight in the ultimate truth, formulated the study called "Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamanam" (The Interrelation of Souls).  The word "Jinamya" in the sutra is the noun, and the words from "Jinanumaya" to "Jinapastham" are its attributes.  Through these attributes, the sutra-author has described the glory and grandeur of Jain doctrine.  These attributes all represent different aspects of "Janamata" (Jain doctrine).  The meaning of each attribute is as follows:  Jinanumaya: This Jain doctrine is approved by the Jinas.  The present-day Jain doctrine is moving under the authority of the supreme Tirthankara, the Jain-ruler, the present Tirtha-adhipati, Shri Vardhamana Swami.  After conquering the internal enemies like attachment and aversion, and attaining omniscience and perfect vision, Jineshwara Shri Vardhamana (Mahavira) Swami formulated the twelve-limbes, from Pracharanga to Drishtivada.  This is "Janamata".  This "Jinamata" of Prabhu Mahavira, being the universal truth, is approved by all Tirthankaras, past, present, and future.  All the Tirthankaras who have been in the past, like Rishabha, and those who will be in the future, like Padma-nabha, and those who are present, like Simandhara Swami, all approve and accept it.  Eternal truth is always uniform.  There is no inconsistency or difference in it.  This statement conveys that due to the absence of contradiction in the words of all Tirthankaras, there is uniformity.  Jinanuloma: This Jain doctrine is Jain-concordant, i.e., favorable to the Jinas.  Here, "Jina" refers to Avadhi-jina, Manah-paryaya-jina, and Kevala-jina.  This Jain doctrine is favorable to Avadhi-jina, etc., because:  1.  Jina-approved, as stated by the Jinas, the Manah-paryaya-Jinas, and the Kevala-Jinas.

The *Jivajivaabhigamsutra* is suitable. It means that by this principle, *Jinatva* is attained. As said, by partaking of the *Jinamat*, the *Sadhu* class attains *Avadhijnana*, *Man:paryavgyana* and *Kevalgyana*. Therefore, *Jinamat* is adorned with the epithet *Jinanulom*. *Jinappaniyam* - This *Jain* principle is *Jin* originated. That is, it is stated by the present *Tirthadhipati* Shri Vardhaman Swami. Upon attaining *Kevalgyana*, Shri Vardhaman Swami told the *Ganadharas* like Gautama, who had the supreme qualities like *Beejabuddhi*, the three *Matrika* words, which are the essence of all meanings, " *Uppanna* *iva*, *Vigame* *iva*, *Dhuvei* *iva*." Taking these three *Matrika* words as the basis, the *Ganadharas* like Gautama composed the *Dwadashangi*. Therefore, this *Jinamat* is *Jin* originated. This statement shows that the *Pragam* *sutra* is *Paurusheya* and not *Apaurusheya*. *Agama* is a word form and without the action of a person, words cannot be uttered. Without the action of a person, words do not sound in the sky. Those who follow the *Mimamsa* school consider *Agama* to be *Apaurusheya*. Their belief is refuted by this epithet. *Jinparooviyam* - This *Jinamat* is formulated by the *Jineshwara*. This epithet shows that Lord Vardhaman Swami formulated this principle in such a way that the listeners could understand its essence well. Here, one may doubt that this study or topic will remain with unknown meaning, even if it is heard from the *Sarvagya*. Because the intention of the *Sarvagya* cannot be grasped directly. In such a situation, how will there be conviction or belief in the meaning of the word that is the subject of that intention? Just as a *Mlechchha* person can only imitate the speech of an *Aarya* person, but cannot understand its meaning, similarly, the listener cannot understand the meaning of the words of the *Sarvagya*. The solution to the above doubt is that although the intention of the speaker is indirect, it is still known through inference etc. By knowing the intention, the listener gets to know the meaning of the word with the help of the indication. If this does not happen, then the eternal word usage will be destroyed. There will be no use of word usage. Even a child understands the meaning from words. Words like *Saindhava* etc., which have many meanings, are also indicated by the Lord and tell the fixed meaning through context and appropriateness etc. Therefore, even words with multiple meanings convey the intended meaning. ... The Lord formulates the principles in such a way that the listener gets the right understanding. The Lord is well-wisher of all, He is not misleading, therefore, He makes the one who understands otherwise understand his mistake and makes him realize the true meaning. He does not ignore the one who understands otherwise, because He is engaged in the propagation of the *Tirtha*. Therefore, the *Ganadharas* get the intended meaning directly from the words of the Lord and the rest of the listeners get it through tradition. Therefore, *Agama* does not have an unknown meaning. 1. *Paryabhiprāyam ajñātvā mleccha vāgyogatulyatā / Sarvagñādapi hi śrotustadanyasyārthadarśane //*

## First Understanding: Auspicious Introduction

**Jinaakhyam:** This Jain doctrine is spoken directly by the Jinesvara through the power of words. Some wise people say that the Tirthankara does not make any effort to preach, but due to their excellent virtuous past deeds, the listeners have that impression. Just as a Cintamani (wish-fulfilling gem) itself has no color, but due to the contact of the object, it appears colored. Similarly, the Tirthankara does not make any effort to preach, yet due to their virtuous influence, the listeners feel that the Tirthankara is presenting such and such things. This statement is not appropriate. To refute this opinion, the epithet 'Jinaakhyam' is given. This means that the Tirthankara preaches through the direct act of speech, arising from the Tirthankara karma. Even if the listeners feel that way due to mere dominance, when the direct act of speech is available, it would be an exaggeration. Such an assumption could be made elsewhere as well. In such a situation, there would be a direct contradiction. Therefore, the aforementioned belief is not consistent with logic and evidence.

**Jinaanuchinnm:** This Jain doctrine is realized through Samadhi by the Ganadharas. Here, the word 'Jin' should be understood as referring to the Ganadharas. The Ganadharas are endowed with such power that nothing can stop them from attaining benefit. They understand the meaning of this Jain doctrine deeply, and by non-attachment, they attain equanimity and experience the state of Samadhi. Because it is practiced by the Ganadharas, this Jain doctrine is called 'Jinaanuchinnm'. Alternatively, in the past, the ordinary Kevali and other Jins have consumed this doctrine and attained Jintva (liberation). From this perspective as well, 'Jinaanuchinnm' should be understood as consistent.

**Jinpannattam:** This Jain doctrine is declared by the Ganadharas. Due to the extraordinary excellence attained through the aforementioned state of Samadhi, the Ganadharas develop a unique power, through which they create the scriptures in the form of sutras, with distinctions like the Angas, Upangas, and Praacharas. Therefore, this Jain doctrine is in the form of sutras, created by the Ganadharas, meaning 'Jinprajnapta'. The Agamas say, "The Tirthankara speaks in the form of meaning, and the Ganadharas weave it into the form of sutras." In this way, the sutras are established for the benefit of the Jain religion.

**Jindeshiyam:** This Jain doctrine is given by the Ganadharas only to those who are worthy and inclined towards the path of righteousness. This implies that only worthy people should be given knowledge of the principles of the sutras. Here, the word 'Jin' is used for the Vineyas (disciples) who are inclined towards the path of righteousness. This scripture should be given only to those listeners who are facing the path of righteousness and are turned away from the path of unrighteousness. Sudharma Ganadhara gave this scripture to such a worthy Vineya, Shri Jambuswami.

1.  Then the impression arises in the beings due to that dominance. But he himself is situated like a Cintamani, without any effort.
2.  First, the Ganadharas, who are wise, weave the sutras and the scriptures. For the benefit of the religion, the sutras are established.
3.  Here, the Jins are those who are inclined towards the path of righteousness, whose lineage is pure, who are facing the right path, and who are turned away from the wrong path. - Malayagiri Vritti.

---------------------------
[10] The **Jivajivaabhigamsutra** raises the question: If the **Shruta-siddhant** is inherently beautiful, why isn't it given to everyone? The answer is that there is a possibility of harm arising from the inherently unbeautiful nature of unqualified individuals. It is often seen that the sun's rays, which are inherently beautiful, are harmful to owls and other such creatures due to their unsuitability. It is said that one should use something only if it is beneficial for that particular being. For a fish, a hook with bait attached is harmful even though it is food. 

**Jinapassattham** - This **Jinamat** is beneficial for qualified and deserving individuals. Here, the word "Jin" is used for those who are inclined towards the path of righteousness and are averse to the path of unrighteousness. Just as a healthy diet is beneficial for a healthy person because it prevents future diseases, similarly, this **Jinamat** is beneficial for those who are inclined towards the path of righteousness and are averse to the path of unrighteousness. By consuming it properly, this **Jinamat** proves to be beneficial and auspicious. 

Through proper contemplation of this unique **Jinamat** with their **protpatik** and other intellects, the **sthavir bhagavants** who have faith, understanding, and interest in it have formulated this study called **Jivajivaabhigam**, a meaningful name. Although due to the **kaladosha**, intellect and other qualities are declining, one should still understand that even a little knowledge and practice of **Jinamat** is capable of destroying **bhava**. With this belief, one should have faith in **Jinamat** with a gentle heart. 

**Sthavir bhagavants** refer to those **acharyas** whose knowledge and character have matured. Their minds are free from confusion due to **dharmparinnati**, and they have destroyed their **kashayas** through the wealth of **Shruta**. Thus, this sutra discusses the relationship between **guruparvkrama** and its characteristics, as well as its **abhidheya** (purpose).

**Swrupa and Prakar** (Nature and Types) 2. What is **Jivajivaabhigam**? **Jivajivaabhigam** is said to be of two types: 1. **Jivaabhigam** and 2. **Ajivaabhigam**.

## 12] [Jiva-Jivaabhigamsutra]

These sutras generally contain questions and answers. The original text does not mention any specific questioner like Gautama, nor does it address Gautama or anyone else in the answers. This implies that most of the sutra literature was composed as questions asked by the Ganadharas and answers given by Lord Vardhaman Swami. A small portion is composed of questions asked by other inquisitive individuals and answered by the Sthaviras. 

The entire Shruta literature is not just questions asked by the Ganadharas and answered by the Lord. This particular sutra is also a general one, asked by other inquisitive individuals and answered by the Sthaviras. The first question asks about the nature of Jiva-Jivaabhigam. The answer explains its nature by describing its different aspects. 

Jiva-Jivaabhigam is of two types: Jivaabhigam and Ajivabhigam. Abhigam means understanding, comprehension, or knowledge. Knowledge of the Jiva-dravya is Jivaabhigam, and knowledge of the Ajiv-dravya is Ajivabhigam. 

There are essentially two fundamental principles in this universe: the Jiva principle and the Ajiv principle. Everything else is an expansion of these two principles. To emphasize that these two fundamental principles are of equal strength in terms of dravya, the letter 'ch' is used in both terms. 

Jiva and Ajiv are both distinct in nature and have independent existence. The correct understanding of the difference between the Jiva and Ajiv principles is the main subject of spiritual science. Therefore, the scriptures discuss the nature of Jiva and Ajiv in detail. 

The knowledge of the difference between Jiva and Ajiv leads to Samyagdarshan, and then Samyagjnana and Samyakcharitra lead to liberation. Therefore, Jivaabhigam and Ajivabhigam are traditionally considered the cause of liberation. 

The sutrakar first mentions Jivaabhigam and then Ajivabhigam. According to the principle of 'Yathouddeshastatha nirdhesh:' one should give instructions according to the purpose. Therefore, questions and answers regarding Jivaabhigam should have been discussed first, but instead, questions and answers regarding Ajivabhigam were discussed first. 

The reason for this is that there is much to be said about Jivaabhigam, while there is less to be said about Ajivabhigam. Therefore, according to the principle of 'Soochikataah,' questions and answers regarding Ajivabhigam are discussed first. 

Ajivabhigam is of two types: 1. Roopi-Ajivabhigam and 2. Aroopi-Ajivabhigam. Generally, anything that has form is called Roopi. However, here, Roopi refers to form, taste, smell, touch, and all four. 

By implication, taste, etc., are also included along with form, as these four cannot exist without each other. Every atom possesses form, taste, smell, and touch. This refutes the idea that atoms of form are separate and atoms of taste, etc., are entirely separate. 

Considering atoms of form, taste, etc., as entirely separate is contradicted by direct experience. We see that atoms of form like ornaments also possess touch simultaneously, and atoms of taste like ghee also possess form and smell. Atoms of smell like camphor also continuously possess form. Therefore, form, taste, smell, and touch are inseparable. 

Those with form, taste, smell, and touch are Roopi Ajiv, and those without form, taste, smell, and touch are Aroopi Ajiv.

---------------------------
## First Understanding: Nature and Types

Formless non-living entities are not known through sensory perception. They are known through the scriptures (Agamas). There are ten types of formless non-living entities: 1. Dharma-āstikāya, 2. The realm of Dharma-āstikāya, 3. The regions of Dharma-āstikāya, 4. Adharma-āstikāya, 5. The realm of Adharma-āstikāya, 6. The regions of Adharma-āstikāya, 7. Ākāśa-āstikāya, 8. The realm of Ākāśa-āstikāya, 9. The regions of Ākāśa-āstikāya, and 10. Adhāsamaya. These distinctions are explained in the Prajñāpanā Sūtra.

1. **Dharma-āstikāya:** Dharma-āstikāya is the instrumental cause that helps in the movement of self-moving living beings and pudgalas. Just as water helps fish to swim, a stick helps an old person to walk, and a lamp helps a sighted person to see, similarly, Dharma-āstikāya helps in the movement of living beings and pudgalas as an instrumental cause. It is important to note that Dharma-āstikāya does not motivate living beings and pudgalas to move, but only assists them. Just as water does not move the fish, a stick does not move the old person, and a lamp does not show the sighted person, but only assists them, similarly, Dharma-āstikāya assists in movement but does not motivate it.

The existence of Dharma-āstikāya has not been accepted by any other philosophers besides Jainism. Therefore, a natural curiosity arises: what is the evidence for the existence of Dharma-āstikāya? In response, Jain philosophers and scholars have stated that it is necessary to accept Dharma-āstikāya as the regulatory element that governs the movement of living beings and pudgalas. If such a regulatory element is not accepted, then the orderly arrangement of this universe cannot be established. The movement of inert and conscious substances is an empirical fact. If they were to move freely in infinite space, then the orderly arrangement of this world would not be possible. Infinite pudgalas and infinite living beings would move freely in infinite space, becoming so scattered that their meeting and appearance in the form of a fixed creation would become impossible. Therefore, Dharma-āstikāya, the regulatory element that governs the natural movement of living beings and pudgalas, has been accepted.

Only by accepting the existence of Dharma-āstikāya can the division of the world (lok) and non-world (alok) be justified. Despite their natural tendency to move, living beings and pudgalas cannot go outside the world (lok) into the non-world (alok). An atom, from the smallest atom to the largest, can move up to fourteen rajū-lengths. Beyond that, it cannot move in a single region. Who regulates this? Ākāśa cannot be the regulator of this movement because Ākāśa is equally present in the non-world (alok). Therefore, the regulator of this movement is Dharma-āstikāya. Where Dharma-āstikāya is present, there is the movement of living beings and pudgalas, and where Dharma-āstikāya is not present, there is no movement of living beings and pudgalas. 

1.  "The movement of pudgalas and living beings is due to Dharma-āstikāya. It is the instrumental cause, just as water is always present for fish in the world."

## Translation:

**14]** [Jiva-jiva-abhigamsutra motion does not exist. Dharma-astikaya is only in the loka-akasha, therefore the motion of jivas and pudgalas is limited to the loka-akasha / In this way, the existence of dharma-astikaya is proven by its function as an aid to motion. The entire dharma-astikaya is an undivided, indivisible substance, it is in the form of a skandha. Its countless regions are in the form of components / The combined form of the components, the specific result, is the component. Just as the combined form of threads, the patanavitan form, is the cloth. There is nothing else than the cloth, different from the threads. The component and the component are somehow different and not different. 2. The division of dharma-astikaya into two regions, three regions, etc., conceived by intellect, is called the desha of dharma-astikaya. In reality, dharma-astikaya is an undivided substance. Its desha-pradesha, etc., divisions are only conceived by intellect. 3. The region of dharma-astikaya, the very subtle part of the skandha, which cannot be further divided, is called pradesha. 'Pradesha nivibhaga bhaga:' meaning the indivisible, non-fractional part of the skandha, etc., is called pradesha / These pradeshas are countless, meaning they are as vast as the loka-akasha / These pradeshas can only be conceived by intellect / In reality, they cannot be separated from the skandha. In this way, three divisions of dharma-astikaya have been explained: skandha, desha, and pradesha / The question may arise: why is the dharma-dravya called astikaya? The solution is that here 'asti' means pradesha and 'kaya' means combination or community. The community of pradeshas is called astikaya. Dharma-dravya is in the form of a collection of countless pradeshas, therefore it is called astikaya. 4. Adharma-astikaya - the element that aids the state of jiva and ajiva is adharma-astikaya. Just as the shade of a tree becomes a cause for a traveler to rest, in the same way, adharma-astikaya aids the state of jivas and pudgalas / It is also an aid to the state, not a motivator / All the states of being are only possible when adharma-astikaya exists.

## First Understanding: Nature and Types [15 7-8-6]

**Akasa (Space)** is a universally accepted formless substance. According to its literal meaning, Akasa is that in which all other substances are illuminated and manifested without losing their own nature, or that which pervades all substances and is illuminated. Providing space (avagaha) is the characteristic of Akasa. Just as milk provides space for sugar, and a wall provides space for a peg, Akasa is the foundation of all substances. All other substances are dependent on it. 

Although all substances are self-established (svapratiṣṭhita) in their own nature from the perspective of **niścayana (absolute truth)**, from the perspective of **vyavaharanaya (practical truth)**, Akasa is the foundation of all substances. 

One might ask, if Akasa is the foundation of all substances, what is the foundation of Akasa? The answer is that Akasa is self-established. It is not dependent on any other substance. There is no substance greater than or similar to Akasa. Akasa is infinite. It is all-pervasive, encompassing both the world (loka) and the non-world (aloka).

**From a gross perspective, there are two types of Akasa:**

* **Loka Akasa:** The portion of Akasa where the five categories of substance (pancastīkāya) - dharma, adharma, akasa, pudgala, and jīva - exist. Loka Akasa has countless regions.
* **A-loka Akasa:** Where only Akasa exists and nothing else. It is infinite in its regions, boundless and endless. Loka Akasa is merely a point in the vast ocean of A-loka Akasa.

The entire Akasa is the **skandha (mass)** of the Akasa category. Its intellectually conceived portion is the **deśa (region)** of the Akasa category. The indivisible, non-fractional parts of the Akasa substance are the **pradeśa (sub-regions)** of the Akasa category.

**Time (Kāla)**

**Adha-samaya-pradha** means time. It is called adha-samaya because it is in the form of time. Alternatively, the smallest indivisible part of time is adha-samaya. Only the present moment is truly real (sat). The past has perished, and the future has not yet come into existence. Therefore, the past and future are unreal (asat), only the present moment is real. 

Since time is a single entity, it does not form a group, and therefore, the concept of deśa and pradeśa does not apply to it. Time is the divider of the time-field (samayakṣetra) and the non-time-field (asamayakṣetra). 

The cycle of light (jyoti chakra) is active up to two and a half islands (aḍhai dvip), and due to this, time is experienced in this region. Therefore, this region is called the time-field. Beyond this, there is no division of time, and hence it is called the non-time-field. This statement should be understood from the perspective of vyavaharanaya.

**The functions of the Kāla substance are:**

* **Vartana (existence)**
* **Pariṇāma (transformation)**
* **Kriyā (action)**
* **Paratva-aparattva (being the cause and effect)**

**References:**

1. **Ā-samantāt sarvāṇyapi dravyāṇi kāśante-dīpyante'tra vyavasthitānītyākāśam** - All substances are illuminated and manifested in it. This is Akasa.
2. **Ākāśasyāvagāhaḥ** - The characteristic of Akasa is providing space.
3. **Prati kālasyākhyā, praddhā cāso samaya pradhāsamayaḥ, athavā pradāyā samyo nivībhago bhāgo'ddhāsamayaḥ** - The name of time is pradha, and the time of pradha is adha-samaya. Alternatively, the smallest indivisible part of time is adha-samaya.
4. **Vartanāpariṇāmakriyāparatvāparatve ca kālasya** - The functions of Kāla are existence, transformation, action, and being the cause and effect.

[16] The cause of the origin of the Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra is the act of "vartana" (activity). The abandonment of the previous state and the adoption of the subsequent state is the result. The act of "parispandana" (pulsation) is the action, and the relationship of "jyeshtatva" (seniority) and "kanishtatva" (juniority), "paratva" (exteriority) and "aparatva" (interiority) is the state.

There is no consensus among all the Acharyas regarding the acceptance of time as an independent substance. Some Acharyas consider it an independent substance, while others say that time is not an independent substance, but rather the flow of the states of Jiva and other substances.

The argument of the Acharyas who consider time as an independent substance is that just as Jiva and Pudgala, despite having the nature of motion and rest, are considered as "nimitta-karana" (instrumental cause) for that action, in the same way, Jiva and Ajiva, despite having the nature of "paryaya-parinaman" (state transformation), should be considered as "nimitta-karana" for that transformation. Otherwise, there is no logic in considering "dharma-astikaya" and "adharma-astikaya" as instrumental causes. This view is accepted in the Digambara tradition.

The argument of the side that does not consider time as an independent substance is that "paryaya-parinaman" is the action of Jiva and Ajiva, which happens without the influence of any other substance. Therefore, in reality, the collection of states of Jiva and Ajiva should be called time. Time is not an independent substance. Both these views are mentioned in the Svetambara tradition.

Thus, the ten "arupi ajiva" (formless non-living) should be understood as: "skandha, desha, pradesha" of "dharma-astikaya"; "skandha, desha, pradesha" of "adharma-astikaya"; and "skandha, desha, pradesha" and "addha-samaya" of "akasha-astikaya".

Four types of "rupi ajiva" (formful non-living) are mentioned: "skandha, desha, pradesha" and "paramanu-pudgala".

Due to the infinity of "pudgala-skandha", the plural form is used in the original text. As it is said, "The 'pudgala-astikaya' is infinite due to the substance."

The "skandha-desha" are the divisions of "skandha" that are conceived by intellect, such as "dvi-pradeshi" (two-dimensional). The "skandha-pradesha" are the undivided parts that are found in the "skandha". The "pudgala-paramanu" is the independent undivided part that is devoid of "skandha-parinaman" (transformation of "skandha"). The meaning is that the "paramanu" that are connected to "skandha" or "desha" are "pradesha", and the "paramanu" that are independent of "skandha" or "desha" are "paramanu-pudgala".

The only "pudgala" substance is "rupi ajiva". These "pudgala" transform into five colors, two smells, five tastes, eight touches, and five substances.

The "Prajnapanasutra" mentions the options that arise due to the mutual relationship of these colors, smells, tastes, touches, and substances. It is relevant to mention them briefly here.

It is as follows: There are 20 "boles" (combinations) in the substances that have five colors: black, green, red, yellow, and white - 2 smells, 5 tastes, 8 touches, and 5 substances. Therefore, there are 20 x 45 = 100 types of "varna-ashrita" (color-based).

There are 23 "boles" in the "surabhi-gandha" (pleasant smell) and "durabhi-gandha" (unpleasant smell) - 5 colors, 5 tastes, 8 touches, and 5 substances. Therefore, there are 23 x 42 = 46 types of "gandha-ashrita" (smell-based).

## First Understanding: The Nature and Types of Ajiva [17]

**Rasa-based:** There are 5 colors, 2 smells, 8 touches, and 5 forms in the five tastes (sweet, bitter, pungent, sour, and astringent). These 20 elements can be combined in 20^4 * 5 = 100 ways, resulting in 100 rasa-based variations.

**Guru-Laghu-Sparsha-based:** There are 5 colors, 2 smells, 5 tastes, 6 touches (excluding guru and laghu), and 5 forms in the guru and laghu touches. These 23 elements can be combined in 23^4 * 2 = 46 ways, resulting in 46 guru-laghu-sparsha-based variations. The same applies to the cold and hot touches, resulting in another 46 variations. The difference is that we should consider only six touches out of the eight, excluding cold and hot.

**Snigdha, Rooksha, Komala, and Kathira-based:**  Similarly, considering six touches each in snigdha, ruksha, komala, and kathira, we get 23 variations each. This results in 23^4 * 4 = 92 variations.

**Total Sparsha-based variations:** 46 + 46 + 92 = 184

**Sansthana-based:** There are 5 colors, 2 smells, 5 tastes, and 9 touches in the five forms (circle, triangle, square, rectangle, and oval). These 20 elements can be combined in 20^4 * 5 = 100 ways, resulting in 100 sansthana-based variations.

**Total Ajiva variations:** 100 (varna-based) + 46 (gandha-based) + 100 (rasa-based) + 184 (sparsha-based) + 100 (sansthana-based) = 530

**Arupa Ajiva:**  We have previously mentioned 10 variations of arupa ajiva, including dharma-astikaya, etc., and their skandha, desha, pradesha, etc. There are also 20 variations based on the dravya, kshetra, and kala guna of dharma-astikaya, adharma-astikaya, prakasha-astikaya, and kala. Therefore, there are 10 + 20 = 30 variations of arupa ajiva.

**Total Ajiva variations:** 530 (rupa ajiva) + 30 (arupa ajiva) = 560

The duration of the result of varna, etc., is from the shortest, one moment, to the longest, countless moments.

This completes the explanation of Ajiva-abhigma.

**The Nature and Types of Jiva-abhigma**

**6. What is Jiva-abhigma?**

Jiva-abhigma is of two types: Samsara-samavrannaka-jiva-abhigma and Asamsara-samavrannaka-jiva-abhigma.

**7. What is Asamsara-samavrannaka-jiva-abhigma?**

Asamsara-samavrannaka-jiva-abhigma is of two types: ...

---------------------------
[18] What is the **Jivaabhigam** (approach to the soul) that is **Asansarasamavannag** (not associated with the cycle of birth and death)? There are two types of **Asansarasamavannag Jivaabhigam**: **Anantar सिद्ध** (immediately attained) **Asansarasamavannag Jivaabhigam** and **Parampar सिद्ध** (gradually attained) **Asansarasamavannag Jivaabhigam**.

How many types of **Anantar सिद्ध Asansarasamavannag Jivaabhigam** are there? There are fifteen types of **Anantar सिद्ध Asansarasamavannag Jivaabhigam**, such as **Tithth सिद्ध** (liberated by the Tirthankara) to **Anek सिद्ध** (liberated by many). This is the explanation of **Anantar सिद्ध Asansarasamavannag Jivaabhigam**.

What is **Parampar सिद्ध Asansarasamavannag Jivaabhigam**? There are many types of **Parampar सिद्ध Asansarasamavannag Jivaabhigam**, such as **Prathamasamay सिद्ध** (liberated in the first time period), **Dvitiyasamay सिद्ध** (liberated in the second time period) to **Anantasamay सिद्ध** (liberated in the infinite time period). This is the explanation of **Parampar सिद्ध Asansarasamavannag Jivaabhigam**.

This is the complete explanation of **Asansarasamavannag Jivaabhigam**.

After discussing **Ajivabhigam** (approach to non-soul), the **Jivaabhigam** is discussed in these sutras.

Although all this is a discussion of **Jiva** (soul) and **Ajiv** (non-soul), the term "**abhigam**" is added to both to indicate that these souls and non-souls possess the quality of being **abhigamy** (knowable). In other words, these souls and non-souls are objects of knowledge (**jney**).

Advaita (non-dualist) philosophers believe that the soul is not an object of knowledge.

The term "**abhigam**" is added to **Jiva** and **Ajiv** to refute this view.

If the soul is not an object of knowledge, then it cannot be understood. And without knowing its true nature, how can one attain liberation from the cycle of birth and death and progress towards **moksha** (liberation)? In this way, the purpose of scriptural composition would become meaningless. 

Page #63:
---------------------------
## First Understanding: The Nature and Types of Jivaabhigam

This section discusses the nature of Jivaabhigam by explaining the different types of Jivas and their characteristics.

Jivaabhigam is of two types: Samsarasamaapannk and Asamsarasamaapannk.

* **Samsarasamaapannk:** Knowledge of Jivas who are bound to the cycle of birth and death (Samsara).
* **Asamsarasamaapannk:** Knowledge of Jivas who have attained liberation (Moksha) and are free from Samsara.

Samsara refers to the cycle of birth and death in the four realms of existence: Narak (hell), Tiryanch (animal), Manushya (human), and Dev (heaven). Jivas who are bound to these realms are Samsarasamaapannk. Jivas who have attained liberation from this cycle are Asamsarasamaapannk.

Whether a Jiva is bound to Samsara or liberated, they share the same fundamental nature of being a Jiva. This implies that even in liberation, the Jiva continues to exist.

Some philosophers believe that just as a lamp extinguishes and ceases to exist upon being extinguished, a Jiva ceases to exist upon attaining liberation. Similarly, Vaisheshik Darshan believes that liberation occurs when the nine Atmagunas (qualities of the soul) like Buddhi (intellect) are destroyed. This section refutes these beliefs.

If a Jiva ceases to exist upon liberation, or if its Atmagunas like Buddhi, Sukh (happiness), etc. are destroyed, then who would strive for such liberation? Who would seek to destroy themselves? Who would desire to become devoid of happiness? In such a scenario, liberation itself would be destroyed.

Due to brevity, the section primarily focuses on Asamsarasamaapannk Jivas.

There are two types of Asamsarasamaapannk Jivas: Anantar Siddha and Parampar Siddha.

* **Anantar Siddha:** Siddhas who attained liberation immediately upon their last birth. There is no time gap between their last birth and their attainment of Siddhatva (liberation).
* **Parampar Siddha:** Siddhas who attained liberation after a period of time, whether it be two, three, or even an infinite number of lifetimes.

There are 15 types of Anantar Siddhas:

1. **Tirth Siddha:** A Tirth is a place or a path that leads one across the ocean of Samsara. In this context, the teachings of the Tirthankara and the fourfold order of Shramanas established by them are considered a Tirth. The first Ganadhar (disciple) is also considered a Tirth. Those who attain Siddhatva after the establishment of the Tirth by the Tirthankara are called Tirth Siddhas. Examples include Gautam, Sudharma, and Jambu.
2. **Atirth Siddha:** Those who attain Siddhatva before the establishment of a Tirth or after its dissolution are called Atirth Siddhas. For example, Marudevi Mata attained Siddhatva before the establishment of the Tirth by Bhagwan Rishabhdev. During the time between the Tirthankaras like Suvidhinath, the Tirth was dissolved. Those who attained Siddhatva during this time by remembering their past lives and attaining knowledge of the path to liberation are called Atirth Siddhas.

**Note:** The text ends abruptly, leaving the remaining types of Anantar Siddhas and further discussion incomplete.

20] [Jīkālibāsita 3. Tīrthankarasiddha - Those who become Siddhas after establishing a Tirtha are Tīrthankarasiddhas / For example, in this Avasarpini Kāla, from Ṛṣabhadev to Mahāvīra Svāmī, twenty-four Tīrthankaras are Tīrthankarasiddhas. 4. Pratīrthankarasiddha - Those who become Siddhas after being ordinary Kevalis are Atīrthankarasiddhas / For example, an ordinary Kevali. 5. Svayambaddha Siddha - Those who become Siddhas by attaining enlightenment through their own knowledge of jātismaraṇa etc. without the teachings of another are Svayambaddha Siddhas / For example, Nāmirajṛṣi / / 6. Pratiyakbuddhasiddha - Those who become Siddhas by attaining enlightenment on their own after seeing any external cause are Pratiyakbuddhasiddhas / For example, Karakaṇḍu etc. / Although both Svayambaddha and Pratiyakbuddhasiddhas attain enlightenment without the teachings of another, there is a difference between them in terms of the external cause. Svayambuddhas attain enlightenment without any external cause, while Pratiyakbuddhas attain enlightenment after seeing external causes like a bull, cloud, tree etc. ' Svayambuddhas and Pratiyakbuddhas also differ in terms of their Upādhi, Śruta and Linga. There are two types of Svayambuddhas - Tīrthankara and different from Tīrthankara / Tīrthankaras fall under Tīrthankarasiddhas, therefore, here one should understand the authority of Svayambuddhas different from Tīrthankaras. Svayambuddhas have twelve types of Upādhi, while Pratiyakbuddhas have two types at the lowest and nine types at the highest, excluding Vastra. Svayambuddhas have both Pūrvādhiita Śruta and not. If they have it, then the Devatā provides them with a Veṣa (Linga) or they go to a Guru and wear the Muni Veṣa / If they are capable of living alone and desire to live alone, then they live alone, otherwise, they live as Gacchvāsīs / If they do not have Pūrvādhiita Śruta, then according to the rule, they live as Gacchvāsīs wearing the Muni Veṣa in the presence of a Guru. Pratiyakbuddhas have Pūrvādhiita Śruta according to the rule / At the lowest, eleven Angas and at the highest, ten Pūrvādhiita Śruta is less than the previous / The Devatā gives them the Munilinga or they may also remain without a Linga. 7. Buddhabodhitasiddha - Those who become Siddhas after attaining enlightenment from a teacher etc. are Buddhabodhitasiddhas / For example, Jambū etc. 1. Patteya - Buddhas who contemplate the external cause like a bull etc. and attain enlightenment through external perception are Patteya Buddhas. Patteya Buddhas have two types of rules at the lowest and nine types at the highest, according to the rule, they are Pauṛaṇavajja / Svayambuddhas have Pūrvādhiita Śruta, if they do not have it, then they wear the Linga according to the rule in the presence of a Guru, if they are capable of living alone and desire to do so, then they live alone, otherwise, they live in a Gaccha / Patteya Buddhas have Pūrvādhiita Śruta according to the rule, at the lowest eleven Angas and at the highest, ten Pūrvādhiita Śruta is less than the previous / The Devatā gives them the Linga or they may also remain without a Linga /

## First Understanding: The Nature and Types of Moksha-attainment [21 8.

**Female-Ling Siddha:** Those who attain Siddhahood while in a female body are called Female-Ling Siddha. Examples include Malli Tirthankara, Marudevi, etc.

* **Ling** (gender) is of three types: Veda, Body-structure, and Dress.
* Here, the body-structure aspect of Ling is relevant, not Veda or Dress.
* Veda arises from the emergence of Mohkarma (delusion-karma).
* Siddhahood cannot be attained while Mohkarma persists.
* Dress has no connection to liberation.
* Therefore, the focus here is on the female body.

The Digambar tradition believes that liberation cannot be attained in a female body. However, the term "Female-Ling Siddha" acknowledges the possibility of female liberation. There is no logical or scriptural basis for the belief that women cannot attain liberation. Liberation is not linked to body structure but to the excellence of knowledge, vision, and conduct.

Why can't a female body achieve excellence in knowledge, vision, and conduct? Like men, women can also achieve excellence in these areas. The Digambar tradition considers clothing a restriction on conduct, and since women cannot renounce clothing, they have denied them liberation. However, a neutral perspective reveals that clothing itself is not a restriction on conduct. Attachment to clothing is the restriction. If there is attachment to the body even without clothing, then renouncing the body would be necessary for conduct.

Since the body cannot be renounced, can conduct not be followed? The conclusion is that simply wearing clothing does not affect conduct. The scriptures refer to "Moorti" (form) as "Parigraha" (attachment), not objects. Therefore, denying women the excellence of conduct due to their not renouncing clothing, and consequently denying them liberation, is not logical or scriptural.

**9. Male-Ling Siddha:** Those who attain Siddhahood while in a male body are called Male-Ling Siddha.

**10. Neuter-Ling Siddha:** Those who attain Siddhahood while in a neuter body, different from male and female, are called Neuter-Ling Siddha.

* Artificial neuters can attain Siddhahood, but natural neuters cannot.

**11. Self-Ling Siddha:** Those who attain Siddhahood while in the attire of a Jain monk, including the practice of Rajoharan (menstrual purification), are called Self-Ling Siddha.

**12. Other-Ling Siddha:** Those who attain Siddhahood while in the attire of other religions, such as Parivrajaka, Sannyasi, Gerupa, or those wearing clothes, are called Other-Ling Siddha.

**13. Householder-Ling Siddha:** Those who attain Siddhahood while in the attire of a householder are called Householder-Ling Siddha. For example, Marudevi Mata.

**14. One-Siddha:** Those who attain Siddhahood alone at a single time are called One-Siddha.

22] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra 15. Anek Siddha - those who have attained Siddhatva at the same time are Anek Siddha. In Siddhanta, a maximum of 108 Jivas can attain Siddhatva at the same time. In this regard, a collection of verses in Siddhanta states that for eight times, when Siddhas are continuously attained, they are attained from one to thirty-two. That is, in the first time, the minimum is one, two, and the maximum is thirty-two, in the second time also, one to thirty-two Siddhas are attained in the same way. In this way, in the eighth time also, one to thirty-two Siddhas are attained. After this, there will definitely be an interval. When thirty-three to forty-eight Siddhas are attained, this happens for seven times. After this, there is definitely an interval. When fifty to sixty Siddhas are attained continuously, this happens for six times / later there is an interval. When sixty-one to seventy-two Siddhas are attained continuously, this happens for five times / later there is an interval. When seventy-three to eighty-four Siddhas are attained continuously, this happens for four times / later there is definitely an interval. When eighty-five to ninety-six Siddhas are attained continuously, this happens for three times. Later there is definitely an interval.

## [23 First Understanding: Approach to the World-Bound Soul]

Those who have attained the state of liberation, who are known as the "Three-Time-Liberated" and "Secondless-Time-Liberated" should be understood. Similarly, one should understand further. This is the statement of the approach to the world-bound soul.

What is the approach to the world-bound soul? In the world-bound souls, these nine understandings are stated as follows:

1. Some say that there are two types of world-bound souls.
2. Some say that there are three types of world-bound souls.
3. Some say that there are four types of world-bound souls.
4. Some say that there are five types of world-bound souls.
5-10. In this way, one should continue to state until some say that there are ten types of world-bound souls.

**Explanation:**

This sutra presents a question and answer regarding world-bound souls. The question is: What is the nature of the world-bound soul? The answer is given by explaining the different types of world-bound souls. By stating the different types, the nature of the object becomes clear.

Here, nine understandings are presented regarding the types of world-bound souls. The meaning of "understanding" is "statement" or "proposition." There are nine types of propositions in this regard. For example, some teachers say that there are two types of world-bound souls, while others say there are three types. In this way, some teachers say that there are ten types of world-bound souls.

From two to ten types of world-bound souls - these are nine types of statements or propositions. It should be noted that these nine types of statements, while different from each other, are not contradictory. The teachers who say that there are two types of world-bound souls, also say, with a different intention, that there are three types of world-bound souls, and with another intention, four types, and so on, until, with a different intention, they say that there are ten types. 

Page #68:
---------------------------
## 24] There are ten types of Jivaanivaabhigam / There is a difference in statements due to the difference in Vivaksha, but there is no contradiction in them. The Jivas, which are of two types, are also of three types from another perspective, four from another, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten types. Therefore, there is no contradiction in these nine types of Prathipattis / They are all correct and Samyag from different perspectives. The Vrittikar has also said in the context of the word 'Prathipatti' that Prathipatti is not only in the form of words but also that which leads to meaning through words. The Shabdavadvaadis believe that 'Shabdamatram Vishvam' / The whole world is only in the form of words, believing this will only prove the word, not the world / Therefore, the said belief is beyond truth. The truth is that the meaning is stated through words, only then can Prathipatti (knowledge) happen. Syadvad or Apekhavaad is the lifeblood of Jain principles. Therefore, the truth should be understood keeping in mind the expectations of Nay-Nikshep. The object is Anantdharmatmak. It is not one-sided and uniform. If the object is considered to be completely uniform, then the diversity of the world will not be consistent. The statement of the first Prathipatti is 9. Tatha Gan Je Evamhansu 'Duviha Sansarasamaavagnaga Jivaa Pagnata' Te Evamhansu Tan Jahatasa Chev Thavara Chev // [9] Those who state that there are two types of Sansarasamaapanak Jivas, they say that they are of two types due to the difference between As and Thavara. 10. Se Ki Tan Thavara? Yaavara Tiviha Pannaata, Tan Jaha1. Pudhavikaaiyaa 2. Aukkaaiyaa 3. Vanassaiikaaiyaa / [10] What is called Thavara? Thavara has been said to be of three types - . Yatha - 1. Prithvikaayik 2. Apkaayik and 3. Vanaspatikaayik / Discussion - In this Sutra, while describing the first Prathipatti out of the nine Prathipattis that describe the difference in Sansarasamaapanna Jivas, it is said that Sansaravarti Jivas are of two types - Pras and Thavara / All the beings of the world are included in these two differences. According to the etymology of 'Santiti Sa', those Jivas who can move from one place to another are called As. Those Jivas who move from one place to another due to being heated by the heat or who go to the sun due to fear of cold, are the Jivas who can move around. Jivas who have the Asnaamakarm Uday are called As, from this perspective, Dwiindriya, Triindriya, Chaturindriya and Panchendriya Jivas come under As.

[The First Understanding of the Term "Tras"] [25 It is noteworthy here that in the Pragama, Tejaskaaya and Vayukaaya have been considered under the category of Tras. In the same Jivaabhigamsutra, it is further stated that - "Tras are of three types: Tejaskaaya, Vayukaaya and Audarik Tras beings." In the Tattvarthsutra also, it is said that "Tejovaayudvindraadiyashcha Trasah". / 2 Elsewhere, they have been called "Sthavar". The consistency of these two types of statements should be understood as follows - There are two types of interpretations regarding living beings. In the first interpretation, those beings who can move from one place to another with intention and understanding, and who have the emergence of Asanama Karma, are called Tras beings, and in this interpretation, Dwindraadi beings come under the category of Tras, not Tejas and Vayu. In the second interpretation, those beings who move upwards or sideways with or without intention, are called Tras. According to this explanation and interpretation, Tejas and Vayu move upwards or sideways, therefore they are Tras. Such Tras beings have been called "Gatitras". The implication is that when only the interpretation of motion is considered, then Tejas and Vayu are counted among Tras. / But when the interpretation of the emergence of Sthavar Nama Karma is considered, then they are counted among Sthavar. Tejas and Vayu do not have the emergence of Asanama Karma, but they have the emergence of Sthavar Nama Karma. Therefore, the consistency of both types of statements should be understood from the difference in interpretation. Sthavar - "Tishthantityevamshila: Sthavarah" / Those who are unable to leave that place even when they are burnt by heat, etc., and remain there; such beings are called Sthavar. Here, three types of Sthavar beings have been mentioned - 1. Prithvikaaya 2. Apkaaya and 3. Vanaspatikaaya / Generally, five types of Sthavar are counted. Tejas and Vayu are also considered Sthavar due to the emergence of Sthavar Nama Karma. But here, due to the interpretation of Gatitras, only three types of Sthavar beings have been mentioned by counting Tejas and Vayu among Tras. The same has been said in the Tattvarthsutra - "Prithivyambubanaspatiyah Sthavarah" / / 1. Prithvikaaya - Those beings whose body is earth, are Prithvikaayik. / Those who consider the earth as a deity, this statement refutes them. The earth is not a single living being, but a community of countless living beings. As it is said in the Agama - the earth is said to be "Sachitt", it has many separate living beings. / 2. Apkaaya - Those beings whose body is water, are Apkaayik beings. / 3. Vanaspatikaaya - Those beings whose body is a plant, are Vanaspatikaayik beings. 1.

The Earth is the foundation of everything, therefore it is the first to be taken. Water is based on the Earth, therefore water is taken after the Earth. According to the principle "Jattha Jalam Tattha Vanam", wherever there is water, there is vegetation. Therefore, vegetation is taken after water. In this way, the order of Earth, water, and vegetation is established.

The nature of Earth-bodied beings is described as follows: What are Earth-bodied beings? Earth-bodied beings are said to be of two types: subtle Earth-bodied beings and gross Earth-bodied beings. What are subtle Earth-bodied beings? Subtle Earth-bodied beings are said to be of two types: sufficient and insufficient.

Discussion: Earth-bodied beings are said to be of two types: 1. Subtle Earth-bodied beings and 2. Gross Earth-bodied beings. Subtle Earth-bodied beings refer to those who have arisen from the subtle karma, not from relative subtlety or grossness like berries and gooseberries. Those beings whose bodies cannot be seen by the naked eye due to the arising of subtle karma are subtle beings. These subtle beings are present everywhere in the fourteen-stringed universe. There is no place in this universe where subtle beings are not present. Just as kajal is packed tightly in a kajal bottle, or just as fragrance is present everywhere in a perfume box, in the same way, subtle beings are packed tightly in the entire universe - they are present everywhere.

These subtle beings do not encounter any resistance. They pass through even the hard rock of a mountain. These subtle beings do not die when killed, they do not get pierced when pierced, they do not get broken when broken. They do not encounter any harm or resistance from any object in the world.

These subtle Earth-bodied beings, who have arisen from the subtle karma, are present everywhere in the universe. Gross Earth-bodied beings - those Earth-bodied beings whose bodies (when many come together) can be perceived by the naked eye, who encounter harm and resistance, who die when killed, 1. "Pudhavi Chittamantam Akkhaya, Anega Jiwa, Pudho Sattha Prasnattha Satthaparinae Nam" - Dasavai 2. "Suhama Savvalogammi" - Uttaradhyayanasutra

## First Understanding: Description of Earth-bodied Beings [27]

**Earth-bodied beings are those who are pierced by piercing, broken by breaking, and are dull.** They exist only in the reflected region of the universe, not everywhere. The two "chakar" mentioned in the original text indicate the many subtle and dull distinctions.

**Subtle Earth-bodied beings are of two types:**

1. **Sufficient:** Those who have fulfilled their sufficiencies.
2. **Insufficient:** Those who have not fulfilled their sufficiencies or are not going to fulfill them.

To understand the nature of sufficient and insufficient, it is necessary to understand sufficiencies.

**Sufficiency is the power of the soul to take in food and other karmic particles and transform them into body and other forms.** This power is obtained through the accumulation of karmic particles. Upon reaching their place of origin, beings first take in certain karmic particles and continue to take in others, transforming them into body, senses, breath, speech, and mind. The power to transform karmic particles into these forms is called sufficiency.

**There are six types of sufficiencies:**

1. **Food Sufficiency:** The power by which a being takes in food and transforms it into essence and waste (spread portion).
2. **Body Sufficiency:** The power by which a being transforms food into essence, blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow, and semen, the seven bodily elements.
3. **Sense Sufficiency:** The power by which a being takes in karmic particles suitable for the senses from the seven bodily elements and transforms them into senses.
4. **Breath Sufficiency:** The power by which a being takes in karmic particles suitable for breathing and transforms them into inhalation and exhalation.
5. **Speech Sufficiency:** The power by which a being takes in karmic particles suitable for speech and transforms them into speech.
6. **Mind Sufficiency:** The power by which a being takes in karmic particles suitable for the mind and transforms them into mind.

**1. Sufficiency is a special power of the soul to take in food and other karmic particles and transform them.** - Malayagiri Vatti

## Translation:

**[28] The order and time of the *Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra* perfections:**

All perfections begin simultaneously, but their completion occurs at different times. First, the *Ahar-Paryapti* (food perfection) is completed, followed by the *Sharira* (body), *Indriya* (sense organs), *Shwaso-chchwas* (breathing), *Bhasha* (speech), and *Manah-Paryapti* (mind perfection) in order. Each subsequent perfection is more subtle than the previous one. Just as six people sitting together spinning thread, the one who spins finer thread will take longer than the one who spins coarser thread. 

*Ahar-Paryapti* is the most gross, and *Manah-Paryapti* is the most subtle. The time for *Ahar-Paryapti* is one moment. It is completed in one moment. The proof of this is found in the *Prajnapana* (scripture) in the section on food, where it is asked: "Is an *aparyapt* (imperfect) being with *Ahar-Paryapti* a *praharak* (eater) or an *anahaarak* (non-eater)?" The answer is that it is not a *praharak*, but an *anahaarak*. An *aparyapt* being with *Ahar-Paryapti* is only in the *vigrah-gati* (state of disintegration) and is not found in the *upapat-kshetra* (realm of rebirth). A being who has entered the *upapat-kshetra* is a *praharak* from the very first moment. This proves that the time of completion of *Ahar-Paryapti* is one moment. If it were still *aparyapt* with *Ahar-Paryapti* even after entering the *upapat-kshetra*, then the *Prajnapana* would have answered, "Perhaps a *praharak* and perhaps an *anahaarak*," as it has done for the *Sharira* (body) and other perfections.

After this, the *Sharira* (body) and other perfections are completed one by one in each *antar-muhurt* (sub-moment). The time of completion of all perfections is also *antar-muhurt* proof, because *antar-muhurt* is also of many types.

**How many perfections for each type of being?**

* **Ekaindriya** (one-sense) beings have four perfections: 1. *Ahar*, 2. *Sharira*, 3. *Indriya*, and 4. *Shwaso-chchwas*.
* **Dwiindriya** (two-sense), **Triindriya** (three-sense), **Chaturindriya** (four-sense), and **Asanjnī Panchendriya** (non-conscious five-sense) beings have five perfections: the previous four and *Bhasha-Paryapti* (speech perfection).
* **Sanjnī Panchendriya** (conscious five-sense) beings have all six perfections.

*Ahar*, *Sharira*, and *Indriya* - these three perfections are completed by every being. Only after completing these can a being bind the *prayu* (karma) of the next birth. No being can die without binding the *ay* (karma) of the next birth.

In relation to these three perfections, every being is *paryapt* (perfect). However, the division of *paryapt* and *aparyapt* is not based on these three perfections, but on the completion or incompletion of the perfections specific to each type of being.

**Those who complete their own perfections are *paryapt* beings, and those who do not complete their own perfections are *aparyapt* beings.** For example, a *Ekaindriya* being has four perfections. An *Ekaindriya* being who completes these four perfections is *paryapt*, and one who does not complete them is *aparyapt*.

**There are two types of *paryapt* beings:**

1. **Labdhi-Paryapt:** A being who has not yet completed its own perfections but will definitely complete them in the future.
2. **Karan-Paryapt:** A being who has completed its own perfections. 

Page #73:
---------------------------
## First Understanding: Description of Earth-bodied Beings

[29] There are two types of insufficient beings: 1. **Labdhi-aparapti** and 2. **Karan-aparapti**. 

A being who has not fulfilled its own appropriate **paryapti** and will not do so in the future, meaning it will die insufficient, is **Labdhi-aparapti**. 

A being who has not fulfilled its own appropriate **paryapti** but will do so in the future is **Karan-aparapti**. 

Thus, due to the difference between **paryapti** and **aparapti** in subtle earth-bodied beings, there are two types.

To further explain the subtle earth-bodied beings, two **sangrahani** verses are given here:

> **"Sarirogahana sanghayana santhana kasaya taha hanthi sannao. Lesidiya samugdhaae sanni bee ya pajjatti."** // 1 //
> **"Vitthi san naane joguvanoge taha ki mahare / Ubavaay thii samugghyaay chavan gairaagai cheva."** // 2 //

Further, the subtle earth-bodied beings will be described through 23 **dwaras**. These 30 **dwaras** are: 1. **Sharira**, 2. **Avagahana**, 3. **Sanhanan**, 4. **Sansthan**, 5. **Kasaya**, 6. **Sanjna**, 7. **Leshya**, 8. **Indriya**, 9. **Samudghta**, 10. **Sanji-asanji**, 11. **Ved**, 12. **Paryapti**, 13. **Drishti**, 14. **Darshan**, 15. **Jnana**, 16. **Yoga**, 17. **Upayoga**, 18. **Ahar**, 19. **Upapat**, 20. **Sthiti**, 21. **Samavahat-asamavahat maran**, 22. **Chyavan**, and 23. **Gati-pragati**.

The following sutras will discuss these 23 **dwaras** through questions and answers. Following the principle of "**Yathouddesha tatha nirdhesha**", the first discussion will be about **Sharira** and other **dwaras** in order:

[1] **"Tesi nan bhanta! Jiwaanam kati sariraya pannta? Goyama! To sariraga pannta, tanjaha-oralie, teyaye, kammae."** 

[1] **"O Bhagavan! How many bodies are described for these subtle earth-bodied beings?"** 

**"Gautama! Three bodies are described, such as 1. Audarik, 2. Taijas, and 3. Karman."**

[2] **"Tesi nan bhanta! Jiwaanam kemahaaliya sarirogahana pannta? Goyama! Jahannenam angulasankhejjahbhagam ukkosenavi angulasankhejjai bhagam."**

[2] **"O Bhagavan! How big is the **avagahana** of the body of these beings?"**

**"Gautama! The smallest is an immeasurable part of an angul, and the largest is also an immeasurable part of an angul."**

**Ganadhara Gautama, renowned for his exceptional achievements like "Sarvaaksharasannipaati" and "Sanbhinna Shrotolābhi," could describe countless past lives when asked. Why would such a knowledgeable soul like Lord Gautama ask simple questions? Three explanations have been offered to address this curiosity.**

**Firstly, Lord Gautama knew everything and shared his knowledge with his disciples. However, to instill faith in his disciples, he would ask questions to receive answers from the Lord.**

**Secondly, the "Dvadaśāṅgī" and other scriptures contain numerous instances of Ganadharas asking questions and the Lord providing answers. Therefore, the author of the sutras has structured the sutras in this format.**

**Thirdly, even though there were fourteen "Pūrva-dharas" before him, Lord Gautama was still a "Chhadmastha" (one who conceals his knowledge). Even a "Chhadmastha" might have some "Anabhoga" (non-utilization) of knowledge. Therefore, it is appropriate for him to ask questions to confirm the truth and receive the Lord's validation.**

**Lord Gautama asked, "O Supremely Blessed One! How many bodies do the subtle earth-bodied beings have?"**

**Lord Mahavira, addressing Gautama Swami with the renowned "Gautama" lineage, responded in a way that filled Gautama Swami's mind with joy and delight.**

**It is a psychological fact that mentioning the extraordinary qualities of an inquirer inspires them to understand the subject matter better.**

**1. Body-Gate: The Lord said, "The subtle earth-bodied beings have three bodies: Audārika, Tanjas, and Kārmaṇa."**

**Generally, there are five bodies: 1. Audārika, 2. Vaikriya, 3. Prāhārak, 4. Tejas, and 5. Kārmaṇa. Audārika, meaning "Udar" (generous) or "Pradhan" (principal), is made up of the finest "Pudgalas" (particles). It should be understood in comparison to the bodies of Tirthankaras and Ganadharas.**

**Compared to the bodies of Tirthankaras and Ganadharas, the bodies of the "Anuttara Vimāna" (highest celestial beings) are infinitely superior.**

**Alternatively, "Udar" means "Brihat" (large). It is called "Audārika" because it is larger than the other bodies. The Audārika body is a few thousand "Yojanas" (a unit of distance) in size.**

**This is in comparison to the "Brihattar" (innate) "Bhavadhāraniya" (earth-bound) "Vaikriya" body.**

**Otherwise, the "Uttara Vaikriya" (higher Vaikriya) body can be a million "Yojanas" in size.**

**1. "Sankaatīte vi bhave sāhai jamba paro u puchchhezja / Na ya ṇam aṇāiseesī viyāṇai es chhaumatyō."**

**2. "Nahi nāmanābhōgaśchhadmasthasyēha kasyachinnāsti / Shānāvaraṇīyaṁ hi jñānāvaraṇaprakṛti karma."**

## First Understanding: Description of Earth Body

**Or Audaric** - meaning gross, is a body made of gross pudgals. A body that is subject to decay and decomposition, that can be pierced and broken, that has skin, blood, flesh, bones, etc., is an Audaric body.

**Vaikriya Body** - is a body that can be transformed into various or specific forms. A body that can become many from one, one from many, small from large, large from small, aerial from terrestrial and terrestrial from aerial, visible from invisible and invisible from visible, is a Vaikriya body.

This body is of two types: **Aupapatik** and **Labdhipratyayik**.

**Aupapatik Vaikriya Body** - is the body that Devas and Narakas receive at birth.

**Labdhijanaya Vaikriya Body** - is the body that some specific humans acquire the power to create various forms due to the influence of Labdhi.

**Badar Vayu Kayik Jivas** - are also considered to have artificial Labdhijanaya Vaikriya bodies.

This body does not have blood, flesh, bones, etc. It is also not subject to decay and decomposition.

Compared to Audaric, its provinces are countless times more numerous but subtle.

**Aharak Body** - is the body that the fourteen previous Tirthankaras create through specific Labdhi for the purpose of seeing the Riddhi-Mahima of the Tirthankaras and other similar purposes. It is said that for the purpose of animal compassion, seeing Riddhi, knowing subtle substances, and removing doubts, the fourteen previous Tirthankaras create a subtle body the size of a hand through their special Labdhi and send it to the Tirthankara Bhagwan. This subtle body is made of very auspicious, pure, white pudgals like a crystal stone. After creating this body, the fourteen previous Tirthankaras wander in the Mahavideha Adi Kshetra and send it to the Tirthankara Bhagwan. If the Tirthankara Bhagwan has gone elsewhere from there, then a statue the size of a head emerges from that hand-sized body, which reaches wherever the Tirthankara Bhagwan is. From there, it receives answers to questions, etc., and enters the hand-sized body, and that hand-sized body enters the body of the fourteen previous Tirthankaras. This fulfills the purpose of the fourteen previous Tirthankaras. This entire process takes place in one Antarmuhurt. This type of body creation is the Aharak body. This Aharak body may not exist at all in the world. The time of its absence is negligible, one time, and excellent, six months.

**Tejas Body** - is the body that is luminous and is the cause of the digestion of the consumed food, etc., and the cause of radiance. Just as a farmer supplies water to different beds in the field, this body converts the consumed food into juice, etc., and delivers it to the various organs. Through specific tapasya, some men acquire the Labdhi to emit Tejo Leshya.

---------------------------
"The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra is obtained, its cause is also the Tejas-Sharira. This is present in all worldly beings. Karma-Paramanu, mixed with Karma-Sharira and Atma-Pradesha like milk and water, are transformed into the body form and are called Karma-Sharira / Karma-Samuha is the Karma-Sharira / It is the root of all other bodies / The remaining bodies exist only when Karma-Sharira exists / When Karma-Sharira is destroyed, all bodies are destroyed. When the Jiva goes to another motion, the Karma-Sharira along with Tejas remains with it. Due to its ability, this Tejas-Karma-Sharira goes and comes in the motion, it is not visible. Other-Tithikas also agree on this subject. They have said that - This body, being subtle, is not visible while going and coming in the motion. Due to its invisibility, its effect should not be considered. Out of the above five bodies, the subtle Prithvi-Kayika Jivas have three bodies - Audarik, Tejas and Karma / Vaikriya and Aharak are not theirs / Because these two are achievements and by nature of existence, those Jivas are deprived of these achievements. 2. Avagahana-Dwar-The height of the body is called Avagahana. It is of two types - Jghanya and Utkrishta / The Avagahana of subtle Prithvi-Kayika Jivas is an innumerable part of an Angul and the Utkrishta is also an innumerable part of an Angul, but it should be known that the Avagahana is relatively more in the Utkrishta position than the Jghanya position. 3. Sanhanan-Dwar - The special structure of bones is called Sanhanan. They are six - Vajra-Rishabhanarach, Rishabhanarach, Narach, Ardhanarach, Kilika and Sewart. Vajra-Rishabhanarach - Vajra means Kilika. Rishabha means Pariveshtan-Patta and Narach means being bound by Markat on both sides / It means that two bones are joined by Markat-bandh on both sides, they are covered by a third bone-like Patta from above and there is a Kilika piercing all three bones from above. This type of strong bone structure is called Van-Rishabhanarach-Sanhanan. Rishabhanarach - Where there is Markat-bandh, Patta but no Kilika, such bone structure is called Rishabhanarach. Narach - Where the bones are joined only by Markat-bandh, it is Narach-Sanhanan. 1. Savvasa Umhasiddham Rasahi Paharpacakajan Gam Cha / Tejagaladdhinimit Cha Teyagam Hoi Nayavvam / 2.

## First Prostration: Description of the Earth Body [41]

**Ardha-Narach:** A half-narach is where one side has a merktabandha and the other side has a keelika. 

**Keelika:** Where the bones are joined by nails.

**Sevarta (Chhedati):** Where the bones are only joined together (without any binding of nails, etc.), this is called sevarta or chhedati sanhanan.  Often, in humans and other beings, this type of sanhanan requires oil massage, etc.

Among the six types of sanhanan mentioned above, the final chhedavati or sevarta sanhanan is said to be that of the subtle earth-bodied beings. 

Although subtle earth-bodied beings do not have bones in their audarik body, they possess the specific power that would be present if they did have bones. Therefore, their sanhanan is considered to be through treatment. 

Subtle earth-bodied beings do have an audarik body, and due to that body, they possess a specific subtle power.

**4. Sansthanadwar:** Sansthan means form. There are six types of sansthan:

1. **Samachaturasrasansthan:** When sitting cross-legged, the body has four equal angles. The distance between both knees, both shoulders is equal. The distance between the left knee and right shoulder, left shoulder and right knee is equal. The distance from the seat to the skull is equal. This body form is called samachaturasrasansthan. 

Alternatively, according to the science of Samudrika Shastra, a body with all its parts in proper proportion is called samachaturasra.

2. **Nyagrodhaparimandalsansthan:** Nyagrodha means banyan tree. A body where the upper part from the navel is full and the lower part is deficient is called nyagrodhaparimandalsansthan.

3. **Sadisansthan:** Here, sadi refers to the part below the navel. A body where the part below the navel is full and the upper part is deficient is called sadisansthan.

4. **Kubjasansthan:** A body where the arms, legs, head, etc. are fine, but the chest, back, and stomach are deficient and crooked is called kubjasansthan.

5. **Vamansansthan:** A body where the chest, back, stomach, etc. are full, but the arms, legs, etc. are small is called vamansansthan.

6. **Hundasansthan:** A body where all the parts are deficient, inauspicious, and deformed is called hundasansthan.

In response to the question of which sansthan belongs to subtle earth-bodied beings, it is said that their sansthan is like a lentil, moon-shaped sansthan. This moon-shaped, lentil-like sansthan is the hundakansthan. This form cannot exist in the other five sansthans. Therefore, it is included only in the hundasansthan.

Apart from the six sansthans of beings, there is no other sansthan. 

Page #86:
---------------------------
## 42] The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra (principle of interaction between souls) does not have a specific form or structure. It is unstructured. Therefore, one should understand the Hund-Sansthan (body) of subtle earth-bodied beings as being like a lentil in shape. / 5. Kashayadwar (doorway of passions) - The place where beings are bound and suffer is called Kashay, which is the cycle of existence. / The passions are the cause of beings' transmigration and wandering in the cycle of existence. / There are four passions: anger, pride, deceit, and greed. / All four passions are found in subtle earth-bodied beings. Although these passions and their external signs are not visible in these beings, they are present due to subtle effects. They are present due to the peculiarity of subtle effects from non-enjoyment, even if they are not visible. 6. Sanjnaadwar (doorway of consciousness) - There are two types of consciousness: 1. Knowledge-based consciousness and 2. Experience-based consciousness. / Knowledge-based consciousness is the five types of knowledge: Matijnana (perception), Shrutajnana (scriptural knowledge), Avadhijnana (clairvoyance), Manahparyaya (mind-reading), and Kevaljnana (omniscience). Experience-based consciousness is the experience of the fruits of self-created, non-perceivable karma. Here, experience-based consciousness is dominant because knowledge-based consciousness is included in the doorway of knowledge. There are four types of experience-based consciousness: 1. Aharasanjna (consciousness of food), 2. Bhayasanjna (consciousness of fear), 3. Maithunasajna (consciousness of sexual desire), and 4. Parigrahasajna (consciousness of attachment). Aharasanjna is the desire for food, which is the result of hunger-causing karma. Bhayasanjna is the fear that arises from fear-causing karma. Maithunasajna is the desire for sexual pleasure that arises from the awakening of the senses. Parigrahasajna is the attachment that arises from greed. Aharasanjna etc. are forms of desire and arise from the awakening of mohaniya karma (karma that causes delusion). These four types of consciousness are present in subtle earth-bodied beings in an unmanifest form. / 7. Lenyaadwar (doorway of attachment) - The cause of the soul's attachment to karma is Leshya. / Leshyas are the auspicious and inauspicious effects that occur in the soul due to the proximity of substances like black, blue, etc. / Just as a crystal gem has no color of its own, it is transparent, but it takes on the color of the object placed near it, similarly, the auspicious and inauspicious effects that arise in the soul due to the proximity of substances like black, blue, etc. are called Leshyas. The scholars have described six types of Leshyas: 1. Krishna Leshya (black), 2. Neel Leshya (blue), 3. Kapoot Leshya (grey), 4. Tejo Leshya (radiant), 5. Padma Leshya (red), and 6. Shukla Leshya (white). The scholars have explained the nature of these Leshyas through the example of six men who eat jamun fruit. It is as follows: Six men lost their way and sat under a jamun tree in the forest and began to think. One man said that the tree should be uprooted. Another man said that it should not be uprooted but the trunk should be cut. The third said that the large branches should be cut. 1. Krishnaadi dravyasaachivyaat parinaamo yaatmanah / Sphatikasyave tatrayam, Leshyashabdah pravartate / / 

Page #87:
---------------------------
## First Chapter: Description of the Earth Body [43 should be taken]

The fourth said, "Only the clusters of jamun should be broken." The fifth said, "Not all clusters, only the ripe jamuns should be broken." The sixth said, "Why is there a need to cut the trees, etc.? We are only interested in eating the jamuns, so we should simply eat the jamuns that have fallen down." Just as there were six different kinds of thoughts of these men, similarly, there are different streams of results in the Leshyas.

The first three Leshyas, Krishna, Neel, and Kapoth, are inauspicious, and the next three Leshyas, Tej, Padma, and Shukla, are auspicious. Subtle Earth-bodied beings have only the three inauspicious Leshyas. Devas are not born in the subtle beings. Therefore, only the first three Leshyas are present in them.

## 8. Sensory Doors

According to the etymology, "Indanaad Indra," the soul is Indra because it is the supreme lord of all knowledge. Its inseparable mark is the senses. There are five senses: the sense of hearing, the sense of sight, the sense of smell, the sense of taste, and the sense of touch.

These five senses are of two types: Dravyaindriya and Bhavaindriya. Dravyaindriya is also of two types: 1. Nirvritti Dravyaindriya and 2. Upakaran Dravyaindriya.

Nirvritti means a separate structure made of Pudgal. This Nirvrittiindriya is also of two types: external and internal. The outer ear, etc., is external Nirvritti, and it does not have a fixed form. The ears of a human being are on the sides of the eyes and at the level of the eyebrows, while the ears of a horse are above the eyes, and their front parts are sharp. The internal Nirvrittiindriya is the same for all beings. Regarding this, the Agam says that the shape of the sense of hearing is like the fruit of Kadamba, the shape of the sense of sight is like the moon-shaped lentil, the shape of the sense of smell is like the Ati Muktak, the shape of the sense of taste is like a hoof, and the shape of the sense of touch is of various kinds. In the sense of touch, there is generally no distinction between external and internal. In the Tattvarth's original commentary, this distinction is not considered.

Upakaran means the special power of the internal Niti. External Nirvritti is like a sword, and internal Nirvritti is like the edge of a sword, a purer group of Pudgal. There is a slight difference between Upakaran Indriya and internal Nirvritti Indriya, which is in the power and the powerful. Even if the internal Nirvritti Indriya is present, if the Upakaran Indriya is destroyed, the object is not perceived. For example, even if the internal Nirvritti Indriya is in the form of Kadamba, if the power is destroyed by a very loud thunder, etc., the sound is not heard.

##  Translation:

**Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra**

**Bhaavendriya** are of two types: 1. **Labdhi** and 2. **Upayog**. The **kshayopa-shaya** of **aavaran** is **Labdhi-indriya**, and the tendency to act or know according to the **Labdhi** in its respective object is **Upayog-bhaavendriya**. Even though there are many types of **dravya-indriya**, **bhaavendriya**, etc., here we should understand the question and answer with respect to the **baahya nirvatti** form of **indriya**. It is with respect to this that the usage of **ekendriya**, etc., occurs.

**Bakul**, etc., plants, perceive the objects of all five senses in the form of **bhaav**, but they are not called **panchendriya** because they do not have five external senses. Since they have only one external sense in the form of **sparshan**, they are **ekendriya**. In **sukshma prithvi-kayik jivas**, there is only one **sparshendriya**.

**9. Samudghat-dvaar:**  Striking the **karma-dalika** like **vedaniya**, etc., with great force, becoming one with them, is called **samudghat**. There are seven **samudghat**: 1. **Vedana-samudghat**, 2. **Kshaya-samudghat**, 3. **Maranan-tik-samudghat**, 4. **Vaikriya-samudghat**, 5. **Tejas-samudghat**, 6. **Aaharaka-samudghat**, and 7. **Kevali-samudghat**.

**1. Vedana-samudghat:**  **Vedana-samudghat** occurs due to **asata-vedaniya karma**. Overwhelmed by intense **vedana**, the **jiva** brings many **vedaniya**, etc., **karma-pudgala**, including those that are **anubhav-yogya dalika** in the future, to the **udaya-avlika** through **udaranakaran**, experiences **vedana-bhog**, and then discards them - separates them from the **atma-pradesha**.

The **jiva** suffering from **vedana** throws out the **atma-pradesha** enveloped by countless **karma-pudgala** from the body. From those **pradesha**, it fills the **vadan-jghana**, etc., openings and the **karna-skandha**, etc., intervals, and expands throughout the entire body area with **aayam-vistar**, remaining there for an **antar-muhurt**. During that **antar-muhurt**, many **asata-vedaniya karma-pudgala** are **parishatan**, **nirjara**. This is **vedana-samudghat**.

**2. Kshaya-samudghat:** This **samudghat** occurs due to the **kshayo-daya**. The **jiva** overwhelmed by **kshayo-daya** throws out its own **pradesha**, fills the **vadan-udara**, etc., openings and intervals with them, and expands throughout the entire body area with **aayam-vistar**, remaining there. In this state, the **jiva** performs **parishatan** (**nirjara**) of many **kshaya-karma-pudgala**. This is **kshaya-samudghat**.

**3. Maranan-tik-samudghat:** This **samudghat** occurs due to **payu-karma**. In this **samudghat**, the **bala-jiva** performs **parishatan** of many **prayu-karma dalika** according to the previous method. This is **maranan-tik-samudghat**.

**4. Vaikriya-samudghat:** This occurs due to **vaikriya-sharira-namakarma** when the **vaikriya-sharira** begins. The **jiva** in **vaikriya-samudghat** throws out its own **pradesha** from the body, and fills the body's 1. **Panchidio u baulo narova sabba visarovalambhao.

## First Understanding: Description of the Earth Body [45]

**1. Vaikriya Samudghat:** This occurs when the earth body expels the gross pudgalas of the Vaikriya karma, which were bound earlier. This is the Vaikriya Samudghat.

**2. Tejas Samudghat:** This occurs when the earth body expels the Tejas body karma. It should be understood in the same way as the Vaikriya Samudghat. This involves a significant depletion of the Tejas body karma.

**3. Aharaka Samudghat:** This occurs during the formation of the Aharaka body. It involves the depletion of many pudgalas of the Aharaka body karma. The process should be understood in the same way as the Vaikriya body.

**4. Kevali Samudghat:** This occurs before the final moment of liberation when the Kevali's Ayukarma dalikas are reduced, and the Vedaniya, Nama, and Gotra karma dalikas remain in specific quantities. This involves the depletion of many Vedaniya, Nama, and Gotra karma dalikas. It takes eight stages:

* **Stage 1:** Formation of the Danda
* **Stage 2:** Formation of the Kapata
* **Stage 3:** Churning
* **Stage 4:** Expansion throughout the entire universe
* **Stage 5:** Absorption of the intermediate realms
* **Stage 6:** Absorption of the churning
* **Stage 7:** Absorption of the Kapata
* **Stage 8:** Absorption of the Danda, after which the Kevali returns to their own body.

This process significantly depletes the Vedaniya, Nama, and Gotra karma dalikas, making them equal to the Ayukarma dalikas. The time for the six Samudghats (Vedanadi) is Antarmuhurt, and the time for the Kevali Samudghat is Path time only.

**5. Subtle Earth Body Beings:** Among the subtle earth body beings, only three of the seven Samudghats occur: Vedana, Kashaya, and Maranantik. The remaining four Samudghats do not occur because they lack Vaikriya, Tejas, Aharaka, and Kevali Labdhi.

**6. Sanjidwar:** A being with consciousness is called a Sanji. Here, consciousness refers to the ability to recollect the past, present, and future. Beings with specific memory and other mental faculties are Sanji. Beings lacking these faculties are Asanji.

**7. Types of Consciousness:** Consciousness is said to be of three types:

* **Dirghkaliki Sanjna:** This is the consciousness that allows for the recollection of the past, contemplation of the future, and the present activity of attraction and repulsion. This consciousness is found in Devas, Narakas, Garbha, Tiryanch, and Manushyas.
* **Hetuvadopaदेशिकी Sanjna:** This is the consciousness that allows for the present-moment thinking that is useful for attracting what is beneficial and repelling what is harmful for the sustenance of the body. This consciousness is found in beings with two or more indriyas, but not in beings with only one indriya.
* **Dristivadopaदेशिकी Sanjna:** Here, Dristi refers to Samyagdarshan. Beings with Samyaktva, such as those with Kshayopaशमिक, are Sanji. Those with Mithyatva are Asanji. 

Page #90:
---------------------------
The behavior of *sanjni* and *asanjni* should be understood in relation to the long-term *sanjna* from the three types of *sanjna* mentioned in the *jivajivaabhigamsutra*. A question may arise: even in one-sensed beings, ten types of *sanjna* are mentioned in the scriptures, why should they not be considered *sanjni*? The solution is given that although these ten types of *sanjna* are present in one-sensed beings, they are insignificant in quantity and are caused by delusion, therefore they are not considered *sanjni*. For example, a person with two or four pennies is not called wealthy. Similarly, a disfigured person is not called beautiful even if he has beauty. The same should be understood here. Subtle earth-bodied beings do not have long-term *sanjna*, therefore they are not *sanjni*. 

*Asanjni* 11. *Beddwar* - The desire of a woman for a man, of a man for a woman, and of a eunuch for both is *ved*. There are three *veds*: 1. *Striveed*, 2. *Purushved*, and 3. *Napunsakaved*. Subtle earth-bodied beings have *Napunsakaved*. They have *sammucchim* birth. Hellish beings and *sammucchim* beings are *Napunsakavedi*. 12. *Paryaptidwar* - The discussion of *paryapti* and *aparyapti* has been done in the commentary of Sutra number 12. Subtle earth-bodied beings have four *paryaptis*: food, body, senses, and breath, and these four are also *aparyaptis*. These four *aparyaptis* should be understood in relation to the cause. From the perspective of attainment, only one *pranapan* *aparyapti* should be understood. Because even *labdhi* *aparyaptak* fulfill the *paryapti* of food, body, and senses according to the rules. No being dies without binding the lifespan of the next birth, and the lifespan of the next birth is bound only when the three *paryaptis* are fulfilled. 13. *Dristidwar* - *Dristi* means the understanding (acceptance) of the truth as taught by the Jinas. There are three types of *dristi*: 1. *Samyagdristi*, 2. *Mithyadristi*, and 3. *Samyagmithya* (mixed) *dristi*. The correct understanding of the truth as taught by the Jinas is *Samyagdristi*. The opposite understanding of the truth as taught by the Jinas is *Mithyadristi*. For example, a person who has eaten datura sees white objects as yellow. Similarly, a person who considers the truth taught by the Jinas to be false and who is averse to it is *Mithyadristi*. A *dristi* that is neither *samyag* nor *mithya* is mixed *dristi*. Subtle earth-bodied beings have *Mithyadristi* out of the three *dristi*. They do not have *Samyagdristi*. They also do not have *sasvadanasamyaktva*. Even those who have *sasvadanasamyaktva* are 1. *Naraksammucchima Napunsaka* - this is the word of the Lord.

## First Understanding: Description of Earth-bodied Beings [47]

Earth-bodied beings are not born. Due to their always being in a state of extreme contraction, they do not possess mixed vision. Nor is a being with mixed vision born among them, because mixed vision does not have any time. 

14. **The Door of Perception:** The understanding that grasps the common characteristic of a general-specific object is called perception. It is of four types: 1. Visual perception, 2. Non-visual perception, 3. Clairvoyance, and 4. Omniscience. 

Visual perception is the perception of the general form of a general-specific object through the eyes. Non-visual perception is the knowledge of the common characteristic through the remaining senses and mind, excluding the eyes. Clairvoyance is the knowledge of the general form without the help of senses and mind. Omniscience is the knowledge of the common characteristics of all substances in the universe. 

Among these four perceptions, subtle earth-bodied beings possess only non-visual perception. They have a greater tendency towards tactile perception, but no other perception exists in them.

15. **The Door of Knowledge:** While knowing the true nature of an object is called knowledge, the scriptures consider only that knowledge to be true knowledge which is accompanied by right faith. Knowledge without right faith is called ignorance. 

Right faith leads to knowledge in the form of faith-knowledge, scriptural knowledge, and clairvoyance. However, wrong faith leads to ignorance in the form of faith-ignorance, scriptural ignorance, and fragmented knowledge. 

Subtle earth-bodied beings have wrong faith, therefore, they are not considered to possess knowledge. They are definitely considered to have faith-ignorance and scriptural ignorance. 

This faith-ignorance and scriptural ignorance are also extremely minimal compared to other beings like the Badar.

16. **The Door of Action:** The activities (tendencies) of mind, speech, and body are called action. These actions are of three types: mind-action, speech-action, and body-action. 

Out of these three actions, subtle earth-bodied beings possess only body-action. They do not have speech or mind.

17. **The Door of Utilization:** The tendency of the soul in the form of understanding is called utilization. Utilization is of two types: concrete utilization and abstract utilization.

1. "He does not desire to do anything at any time." (This is a quote from the scriptures)
2. "This is the most inferior utilization of the soul, as seen by the wise."
3. "This is the utilization of those who are extremely subtle and small, and it should be known."

From this point onwards, the knowledge of the beings is expanded by the Jina, and the cause of their attainment is the body, senses, speech, and mind. 

Page #92:
---------------------------
[48] [Jiva-jiva-abhigamsutra] The result of accepting the specific dharma (particular dharma) of any object is called sakar-upayoga. It is said, "Pagaro u viseso". Therefore, the eight types of upayoga, which are five jnana and three prajnana, are sakar-upayoga. The result of accepting the general dharma of an object is called anakar-upayoga. The four types of upayoga, which are four darshan, are anakar-upayoga. It is said that there are twelve types of upayoga in total, eight sakar-upayoga and four anakar-upayoga. These subtle earth-bodied beings, having mati-ajnana and shruta-prajnana, are more inclined towards sakar-upayoga than anakar-upayoga. They are more inclined towards anakar-upayoga than acchushurdarshan upayoga. 18. Aharadwar - Ahar means to accept external pudgals. Subtle earth-bodied beings consume the infinite-region skandha from dravya. The countable-region and uncountable-region skandha are not consumable by the being. They consume the skandha that resides in the uncountable regions of the field. They consume the pudgal-skandha that is in any state from the perspective of time. They consume the skandha that is in any state, whether it is in the lowest state, the middle state, or the highest state. From the perspective of bhava, they consume pudgals that have color, smell, taste, and touch. Because every atom has one color, one smell, one taste, and two touches. From the perspective of color, they consume pudgals that have one color, two colors, three colors, four colors, and five colors, considering the common concern (sthanamaargana). And from the perspective of differentiation (bhedamargana), they consume pudgals that are black, blue, red, yellow, and white. This statement should be understood from the perspective of vyavaharanaya. From the perspective of vyavahar, there is one color, two colors, etc. Otherwise, from the perspective of nischyanaya, all five colors are found in the smallest infinite-region skandha. There is also a difference in the specific color like Krishna, etc. Therefore, the question was asked, "What kind of black-colored pudgals do the subtle earth-bodied beings consume? Are they one-quality black, ten-quality black, countable-quality black, uncountable-quality black, or infinite-quality black?" The answer is that they consume pudgal-skandha that is one-quality black to infinite-quality black. Similarly, one should understand the same for two smells and five tastes. From the perspective of touch, they do not consume pudgals that have one touch, two touches, or three touches, but they consume pudgals that have four touches, five touches, up to eight touches. From the perspective of differentiation (bhedamargana), they consume the rough to the coarse. They consume one-quality rough to infinite-quality rough in the rough, etc., touches. Similarly, one should understand the same for all eight touches.

## First Understanding: Description of Earth-bodied Beings

Those subtle earth-bodied beings who consume **pudgalaskandhas** with color, smell, taste, and touch are in contact with their **atma-pradeshas**. They do not consume **pudgalaskandhas** that are not in contact. They only consume those **pudgalaskandhas** that are deeply embedded in their **atma-pradeshas**, not those that are not deeply embedded. Touch can extend beyond the area of deep embedding, while deep embedding occurs within the same area. Therefore, different questions and answers have been given.

There are two types of deeply embedded **pudgalaskandhas**: **ananta-avagadh** and **parampara-avagadh**. Those that are uninterruptedly present in their **atma-pradeshas** are **ananta-avagadh**, and those that are present with the interruption of one, two, three, etc. **pradeshas** are **parampara-avagadh**. Subtle earth-bodied beings consume **ananta-avagadh pudgalas**, not **parampara-avagadh**. These **ananta-avagadh pudgalas** are both **anu-rupa** (with few **pradeshas**) and **bahya-rupa** (with many **pradeshas**).

These subtle earth-bodied beings consume both types of **pudgalas**. The earth-bodied being consumes the **pradeshas** located above or sideways within the area where it is deeply embedded. In the **antar-muhurta** time period in which the being consumes consumable substances, it consumes them at the beginning, middle, and end of that **antar-muhurta** time period. These subtle earth-bodied beings consume **pudgalaskandhas** that are suitable for their nourishment, not those that are unsuitable.

These subtle earth-bodied beings consume **pudgalas** that are in accordance with their **svavishaya** (own nature), not those that are not in accordance. This means they consume **pudgalas** that are close by, not those that are distant. These subtle earth-bodied beings consume the **pudgalas** that are close to them from all six directions if there is no obstruction. If there is an obstruction, they consume **pudgalas** from three, four, or five directions.

Obstruction means slipping from the **alokakasha** (non-luminous space). This is explained as follows: When a subtle earth-bodied being is located in the **lok-nishkuta** (the last edge) in the **praag-neya** corner of the lower **pratar**, there is a lack of **pudgalas** in the downward direction due to the absence of **alok** below. Being located in the **agney-kona** (south-east corner), there is an influence of **pudgalas** from the east and south directions. In this way, the downward, east, and south directions are filled with **alok**, so there is a lack of **pudgalas** in these directions. Therefore, it is only possible to consume **pudgalas** from the remaining three directions.

Therefore, it is said that these subtle earth-bodied beings consume **pudgalas** from three directions due to obstruction. When the same being is present in the west direction, its east direction becomes more prominent. The south and downward directions are filled with **alok**, so the being consumes **pudgalas** from four directions: upward, east, west, and north. 

Page #94:
---------------------------
## 50] [Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra] When the Jiva is in the western direction of the second and subsequent Pratyagata, its downward directions also increase. Only the southern direction, which is one-sided, remains obstructed from the light. In such a situation, the Jiva receives the Pudgalas situated in the five directions, including the aforementioned four and the downward directions. _Concluding the Aharadwar, the Sutrakar has said that these subtle Prithvikaayik Jivas often receive Pudgalas of all five categories, both fragrant, five-flavored, and eight-touching, and transform their previous color, taste, smell, and touch qualities, creating new color, smell, taste, and touch qualities, and receive the Pudgalas firmly established in their body-field as food from their Atma-Pradeshas._ 19. Upapatadwar - The place from where one receives birth is Upapat. These subtle Prithvikaayik Jivas are not born from Narakas, nor are they born from Devas. Such is the nature of Bhava that Devas and Narakas are not born as subtle Prithvikaayas. These Jivas are born from all the remaining sufficient and insufficient Tiryanchas, except for the Tiryanchas with an immeasurable lifespan. Tiryanchas with an immeasurable lifespan are not born among them. They can be born from all the remaining sufficient and insufficient humans, except for the humans born in the Karmabhoomi, the Antaradvipas, and those with an immeasurable lifespan in the Karmabhoomi. 20. Sthitidwar - Sthiti refers to the lifespan of that birth. The Sthiti of a subtle Prithvikaayik Jiva is from the least to the most, only an Antarmuhurta. But one should understand that the excellent Antarmuhurta is more than the least Antarmuhurta. 21. Samavahata-Asamavahata Dwar - The death that occurs after the Maranantakasamudghata is Samavahata, and the death that occurs without the Maranantakasamudghata is Asamavahata. Both types of death occur in subtle Prithvikaayik Jivas. 22. Chyavanadwar - The end of that Bhava upon the completion of the present Bhava is Chyavan. Subtle Prithvikaayik Jivas, upon death, are not born in Narakas nor in Devas. They are born in Tiryanchas and humans. If they are born in Tiryanchas, they can be born in all the remaining one-sensory to five-sensory sufficient and insufficient Tiryanchas, except for the Tiryanchas of the Bhogbhoomi with an immeasurable lifespan. If they are born in humans, they are born in all the remaining sufficient or insufficient humans, except for the Akarmabhoomij, Antaradvipaj, and humans with an immeasurable lifespan. This statement also proves that the Atma is not omnipresent and that it is born in Bhavantera. 23. Gati-Agati Dwar - The place where the Jiva goes after death is its Gati, and the place from where the Jiva receives birth is its Agati. Subtle Prithvikaayik Jivas have two Gatis and two Pragatis. These subtle Prithvikaayik Jivas, upon death, are born in Tiryancha and human Gatis, not in Narakas and Devas. Therefore, Tiryanchagati and Manushya Gati are their two Gatis.

## First Understanding: Description of Earth-bodied Beings

[51] These subtle earth-bodied beings are not born from gods or hell beings. They are only born from animals and humans, therefore these beings are of two origins. /  These subtle earth-bodied beings are all-bodied, countless in number, as vast as the space of the universe. This is how all the Tirthankaras have declared it.  

Samanauso - O Shraman! O Ayushman! Addressing the inquisitive disciples in this way, Lord Mahavira explained the nature of subtle earth-bodied beings. 

What are the subtle earth-bodied beings? Subtle earth-bodied beings are of two types - as follows: smooth (soft) subtle earth-bodied beings and rough subtle earth-bodied beings. 

[14] What are the smooth subtle earth-bodied beings? Smooth subtle earth-bodied beings are of seven types - as follows: those who are born in the womb, those who are born from eggs, those who are born from moisture, those who are born from heat, those who are born from decay, those who are born from seeds, and those who are born from the union of two. 

[15] What are the rough subtle earth-bodied beings? Rough subtle earth-bodied beings are of two types - as follows: those who are born from the womb and those who are not born from the womb. 

Bante! How many types of bodies do beings have? Gotama! There are three types of bodies - as follows: those who have a body made of earth, those who have a body made of water, and those who have a body made of karma. 

And also, there are four types of bodies, the remaining ones, like the subtle earth-bodied beings, from the food they eat to the six types of rules. 

The attention of the animal, human, god, and god-like beings, from the god-like beings to the Sohammesha, is fixed on the world. In this way, the lifespan of the beings is thousands of years, with the help of the great food. 

Bante! Do beings die with awareness or without awareness? Gotama! They die with awareness and also without awareness. 

Bante! Where do beings go after they die? Where are they reborn? Are they reborn in hell? Ask. They are not reborn in hell, they are reborn in the animal realm, they are reborn as humans, they are not reborn as gods, and also, they are reborn in countless worlds. 

Bante! How many types of destinies and origins do beings have? Gotama! Two destinies, three origins, and countless others, Samanauso! This is the subtle earth-bodied being. 

This is the earth-bodied being. 

Page #96:
---------------------------
## 52] [Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra [15] What are the smooth (soft) Bādar Earth-bodied beings? The smooth Bādar Earth-bodied beings are said to be of seven types - black soil, etc., according to the knowledge of the differentiation sutra. However, they are said to be of two types in brief - sufficient and insufficient. / O Bhagavan! How many bodies are said to be of these beings? Gautama! Three bodies are said to be, such as, Praudārika, Tejas and Kārmaṇ. / In this way, all the statements should be known as before. / The special feature is that they have four Leshyās. The rest of the statement should be known like the subtle Earth-bodied beings, as they take food from all six directions according to the rule. / These Bādar Earth-bodied beings are born from the Tiryanch, human and Devas. If they come from the Devas, they come from the Saudharma and Ishan (first and second) Devalokas. Their duration is from the lowest Antarmūhurta to the highest twenty-two thousand years. O Bhagavan! Do these beings die with Samavaha or without Samavaha? Gautama! They die with Samavaha and also without Samavaha. Bhagavan! Where do these beings go after death from there? Where are they born? Should questions like, are they born in Narakas, be asked? Gautama! They are not born in Narakas, they are born in Tiryanch, they are born in humans, they are not born in Devas. They are not born in Tiryanch and humans who have an immeasurable lifespan, etc. / / Bhagavan! How many speeds and how many speeds are said to be of those beings? Gautama! They are said to be of one speed and three speeds. O Ayushman Shraman! Those Bādar Earth-bodied beings are each-bodied and are immeasurable Lokākāsha in measure. Thus, the description of the Bādar Earth-bodied beings is complete. With this, the description of the Earth-bodied beings is complete. / Discussion - The Earth-bodied beings whose body is Bādar in the form of a Hosamūha, which is perceptible to the eye, are the Bādar Earth-bodied beings. There are two types of Bādar Earth-bodied beings - smooth Bādar Earth-bodied and rough Bādar Earth-bodied. / The soil which is soft like ground flour is smooth Earth, and the beings which are similar to it are also called smooth Bādar Earth-bodied by treatment. The Earth with roughness is rough Bādar Earth. The beings similar to it are called rough Bādar Earth-bodied by treatment. Smooth Bādar Earth-bodied - There are seven types of smooth Bādar Earth-bodied - black soil, etc., according to the knowledge of differentiation. The Sutrakar has given information about knowing the meaning of that text of differentiation. The meaning of that text of differentiation is as follows... 

Page #97:

## [53 First Understanding: Description of Earth Bodies]

1. Black soil, 2. Blue soil, 3. Red soil, 4. Yellow soil, 5. White soil, 6. Pandu soil, and 7. Panka soil - these seven types of soils are Shlakshna Badar Earth. / The beings residing in them are A-Shlakshna Badar Earth-bodied beings. / The first five distinctions are clear from the difference in color. Pandu soil is that which is known as Pandu in a particular region, being in the form of soil. The commentator has interpreted Panka-Mrittika as follows - the soft mud that remains in the land after the filling up of rivers etc. and its receding, which is also called 'Jalmal', is Panka-Mrittika. The beings residing in it are also called Panka-Mrittika Shlakshna Badar Earth-bodied by convention.

Khar-Badar Earth-bodied: Khar-Badar Earth-bodied have been said to be of many types. Mainly, forty types have been mentioned in four stanzas. They are as follows: 1. Pure Earth - riverbank, wall, 2. Sugar, small pebbles etc., 3. Baluka - sand, 4. Upala - tank etc. equipment sharpening stone (for increasing the size), 5. Shila - large stone suitable for grinding, 6. Lavana - salt etc., 7. Us - alkaline soil which makes the land barren, 8. Iron, 9. Copper, 10. Ranga, 11. Sosa, 12. Silver, 13. Gold, 14. Vajra - diamond, 15. Harital, 16. Hingulu, 17. Manahshila, 18. Sasag - mercury, 19. Anjan, 20. Praval - coral, 21. Abhrapatal - mica - bhodal, 22. Abhrabbaluka - mica mixed sand, and (18 types of various kinds of gems like) 23. Gomejjaka, 24. Ruchaka, 25. Anka, 26. Sphatika, 27.

Jalakanta, and 40. Suryakanta. / After mentioning the 40 types of Khar-Badar Earth-bodied in this way, by saying 'Je Yavanne Thappagaara', other types like Padmaraga etc. have also been indicated. / These Badar Earth-bodied have been said to be of two types in brief: sufficient and insufficient. / The beings who have not fulfilled their own sufficient qualities, their color etc. characteristics are not clear, therefore, they cannot be described by black etc. specific colors. Color etc. appear in Badar beings only when the body etc. sufficient qualities are fulfilled. These insufficient beings die before fulfilling the sufficient quality of exhalation, therefore, the specific color etc. of these insufficient beings cannot be mentioned. / In general, color etc. appear as soon as the body sufficient quality is fulfilled. Therefore, it has been said that insufficient beings do not have specific color etc. / General color etc. are present.

## Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra: On the Gross Earth-Bodies

In these gross earth-bodies, which are substantial living beings, there are thousands of varieties due to differences in color, smell, taste, and touch. For example, there are 5 colors, 2 smells, 5 tastes, and 8 touches.  

Even within a single color, like black, there are many subtle variations due to its intensity. Coal and soot are both black, but their blackness differs in intensity. Similarly, one should understand the variations within other colors like blue. 

The same principle applies to smell, taste, and touch.  Furthermore, combinations of these categories create even more variations, like gray and brown. Similarly, combinations of smell, etc., lead to many variations. Therefore, it is said that there are thousands of variations based on color, etc.

There are a hundred thousand types of these gross earth-bodies. Each color, smell, taste, and touch has three types of closed wombs in earth-bodies: sentient, non-sentient, and mixed. 

Each of these has three variations based on cold, hot, and moderate. Even within cold, etc., there are many variations based on intensity. 

Even though there are countless individuals with a specific color, they are considered as one womb-caste due to their shared characteristics.  Thus, there are a hundred thousand types of wombs in earth-bodies. 

It is said that there are seven hundred thousand types of wombs in all earth-bodies, both subtle and gross. These gross earth-bodies are born in countless numbers under the shelter of one substantial being. Where there is one substantial being, there are countless non-substantial beings under its shelter.

The body, organs of perception, etc., of these gross earth-bodies should be considered similar to those of the subtle earth-bodies, as explained earlier. Only the specific characteristics and differences are mentioned here.

One should understand the specific characteristics of the lower organs:

* **Taking Organ:** In subtle earth-bodies, three types of leshyas were mentioned. In gross earth-bodies, there are four leshyas. They also have a tejo-leshya. From the Vyantar Devas to the Ishana Devaloka, the gods are born in their palaces and vehicles due to extreme fainting, and they have tejo-leshya. The Agam says, "Jalle se marai, salle se uvvjai" (One is born in the same leshya in which one dies). Therefore, for a short time, non-substantial beings also have tejo-leshya.
* **Mouth Organ:** Gross earth-bodies regularly consume food from all six directions. Since gross beings are born in the middle of the universe, not at the edges, there is no question of obstruction.
* **Receiving Organ:** Gross earth-bodies can be born from Devas, as well as from other beings. Therefore, they can be born from animals, humans, and Devas.
* **Position:** Their position ranges from the lowest, lasting only a moment, to the highest, lasting twenty-two thousand years.
* **Movement:** They can also be born from Devas, so they have three types of progress and two types of movement.

## First Understanding: The Right of the Apkayika [55]

Thus, O Ayushman! O Shramanas! These Badar Prithvikaayika beings are each-bodied and are said to be countless, as vast as the Lokakasha. This is the description of the Badar Prithvikaaya, and with this, the right of the Prithvikaaya is complete.

The right of the Apkayika [16] What are the Apkayika? Apkayika beings are said to be of two types, namely, the Sukshma Apkayika and the Badar Apkayika. / The Sukshma Apkayika beings are of two types, namely, the Paryapta and the Aparyapta. / Bhagavan! How many bodies are said to be of these beings? Gautama! They are said to be of three bodies, namely, the Audarika, the Taijasa, and the Karman. / Thus, all the doors should be described like the Sukshma Prithvikaayika. / The special feature is that in the Sansthana door, their Stibuk (bubble form) is called the Sansthana. / The rest should be described in the same way, as long as they are of two motions, two arrivals, each-bodied, and countless. / This is the right of the Sukshma Apkayika.

The Badar Apkayika [17] What are the Badar Apkayika? The Badar Apkayika are said to be of nine types, namely, the Osa, the Hime, and so on, up to the Tahppagaara. / These are collectively of two types, namely, the Paryapta and the Aparyapta. / All of them are of nine Stibuk Sansthita, with four layers, their food is regulated by the six senses, their birth is in the Tiryanch, the Jonia, the Manusya, and the Deva, their lifespan is from one to seven thousand years. 

Page #100:
---------------------------
[56] From the Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra, tell me, O Shraman, what are the characteristics of the Badar Apkayika, which are two-gated, three-gated, and countless in number, and which are found in the earth-body? [17] What is the nature of the Badar Apkayika? Badar Apkayika are said to be of many types, such as Pros, Him, and other similar forms of water. They are briefly of two types: sufficient and insufficient. / Thus, it should be said as before / The characteristic is that their institution is Stibuk (bubble). They have four Leshyas, six directions according to the Pahar rule, from the Tiryanch Yonic, humans and gods, the position should be known from the lowest to the innermost moment and the highest seven thousand years / The remaining Badar should be known like the earth-body, as long as they are two-gated, three-gated, each-bodied, and countless. / O Ayushman! O Shraman! This is the statement of the Badar Apkayika. With this, the authority of the Apkayika is complete. Discussion - After describing the earth-bodied beings, information about the Prakayika beings has been given in these two sutras. Apkayika beings are said to be of two types - subtle Apkayika and Badar Apkayika / Subtle Apkayika beings are present in all the lokas and Badar Apkayika beings are in places like Ghanodadhi etc. In relation to subtle Apkayika beings, the aforementioned 23 doors should be understood as the same as the subtle earth-bodied beings / Only the institution door is different. The institution of subtle earth-bodied beings is described as being like a lentil-shaped pulse, while the institution of subtle Apkayika beings is like a bubble. Badar Apkayika beings - Badar Apkayika beings are said to be of many types, such as Pros, ice, etc. / Their special description should be known according to the Prajnapan Sutra / That authority is as follows - 'Badar Apkayika beings are said to be of many types, such as Pros, Him (frozen water-ice) Mahika (subtle rain in the womb-month-Ar) Karak (hail) Haratanu (water drop remaining on the grass etc. that sprouts by breaking the ground), Shuddhodak (water falling from the sky or river etc.) Shitoadak (cold well etc. water) Ushnodak (hot spring water) Ksharodak (salty water) Khattodak (slightly sour water) Amlodak (more kanji-like sour water) Lavnodak (salt sea water) Varunodak (Varun sea water with a taste like wine) Kshirodadak (Kshirasamudra water) Ghritodak (Ghritvarasamudra water) Kshododak (Ikshurasasamudra water) and Rasodak (Pushkarvarasamudra water) etc., and there are other similar waters. They should all be understood as Badar Apkayika. They are of two types - sufficient and insufficient / In these, 1. Pracharanganiyukti and Uttaraadhyayan Pra. 36 verse 26 only mentions five types of Badar Apkayika: 1. Shuddhodak, 2. Pros, 3. Him, 4. Mahika Por 5. Haratanu /

## First Understanding: The Subtle Plant-bodied

[57] Those who are insufficient beings, are not said to have black, etc., specific colors, smells, tastes, and touches, due to the manifestation of their color, smell, taste, touch, etc., but generally, due to having a body, they have color, etc., in an unmanifest form. / Those beings who are sufficient, are of various kinds due to color, smell, taste, and touch. Due to the difference in color, etc., and their subtlety, there are thousands of their kinds. In total, they have seven hundred thousand species. / In the lifespan of one sufficient being, countless insufficient beings are born. / Where there is one sufficient being, there are countless insufficient beings by rule.

Regarding the subtle plant-bodied beings, one should understand the 23 gates in the same way as the subtle earth-bodied beings. The difference is that the institution of the subtle plant-bodied beings should be understood as being like a bubble. / In the gate of position, one should understand the lowest as a moment, and the highest as seven thousand years. / The rest of the statements should be understood in the same way as the subtle earth-bodied beings. O Venerable Ascetic! Those subtle plant-bodied beings are said to be each-bodied and countless in number, as vast as the space of the universe. This is the description of the subtle plant-bodied beings.

## The Plant-bodied

[18] What is the nature of the plant-bodied beings? The plant-bodied beings are said to be of two kinds, namely: the subtle plant-bodied and the gross plant-bodied.

[16] What are the subtle plant-bodied beings? The subtle plant-bodied beings are of two kinds, namely: the sufficient and the insufficient. The description of these should be understood in the same way as the subtle earth-bodied beings. The special feature is that the institution of the subtle plant-bodied beings is impermanent. / These beings are those who go in two motions and those who obtain in two motions. They are non-each-bodied (infinite-bodied) and infinite in number. / O Venerable Ascetic! This is the description of the subtle plant-bodied beings.

[19] What are the gross plant-bodied beings? The gross plant-bodied beings are of two kinds, namely: the gross plant-bodied beings with a leaf-like body and the gross plant-bodied beings with an ordinary body. 

Page #102:
---------------------------
[58] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra [19] What are the characteristics of the Bādar Vanaspathikāya? There are two types of Bādar Vanaspathikāya: Pratyekasharīra Bādar Vanaspathikāya and Sādhāraṇasharīra Bādar Vanaspathikāya. / 20. What are the Patteyaśarīra Bādar Vanaspathikāya? Patteyaśarīra Bādar Vanaspathikāya are of twelve types, such as: Rukkha, Guccha, Gumma, Latā, Valli, Pādhvagā, Tṛṇa, Valaya, Harita, Oushadhi, Jalaruha, and Kuhaṇā. // 1 // What is Rukkha? Rukkha is of two types: Ekaṭṭhiya and Bahubīyaga. / What is Ekaṭṭhiya? Ekaṭṭhiya is of many types, such as: Nimb, Prām, Jāmun, Yāvat Punāga Nāgavṛksha, Śrīparṇī, and Aśoka, and other similar trees. / These have countless living beings in their roots, 

Page #103:
---------------------------
## First Understanding: The Plant-bodied (Bādar Vanaspatikāyika)

**[59] Roots, stems, bark, branches, corals, leaves - each of these is a single-bodied being. Their flowers are multi-bodied, and their fruits are single-seeded.** This describes single-seeded trees. What are multi-seeded trees? Multi-seeded trees are of many types, such as Astika, Tendu, Amber, Kabith, Pravala, Panas, Dadim, Nyagrodha, Kadumbar, Tilaka, Lakuch (Lavaka), Lodhra, Dhawa, and others of this kind. Their roots are countless-bodied, and their fruits are multi-seeded. This describes multi-seeded beings. Along with this, the description of trees is also given. In this way, as stated in the Prajñāpanā, it should be said here, from "other types" to "Kuhan".

**Gāthārtha:** The arrangements of trees are of various kinds. The leaves and stems of Tāla, Sarala, and Nārikeli trees are single-bodied. Just as a block made of sesame seeds mixed with smooth substances is uniform, but the seeds within it are separate, so too are the body aggregates of each being. Just as there are many separate sesame seeds in a sesame cake, so too are the body aggregates of each being separate, yet they are in the form of a community. This describes the plant-bodied beings (Bādar Vanaspatikāyika).

**Vivecana:** Those who have the name "Bādar" are called plant-bodied beings (Bādar Vanaspatikāyika). There are two types of these: each-bodied (Pratyekasharīrī) and ordinary-bodied (Sādhāraṇasharīrī). Those beings who have separate bodies are each-bodied, and those beings who have a combined body are ordinary-bodied. These two threads describe the plant-bodied beings (Bādar Vanaspatikāyika).

Twelve types of each-bodied plant-bodied beings (Bādar Pratyekasharīrī Vanaspatikāyika) have been mentioned. They are as follows:

1. **Vṛkṣa:** Trees like Neem, Mango, etc.
2. **Guccha:** Plant-like beings like Brinjal, etc.
3. **Mulma:** Flower-bearing plants like Navamalika, etc.
4. **Latā:** Vines that climb on trees, like Champakalatā, etc.
5. **Valli:** Vines that spread on the ground, like Kasmāṇḍa, Apūṣī, etc.
6. **Parvag:** Plants with knots, like Iksu, etc.
7. **Tṛṇa:** Green grasses like Dūba, Kāsa, Kuśa, etc.
8. **Valaya:** Those with round bark, like Ketaki, Kadali, etc.
9. **Harita:** Green vegetables like Bathu, etc.
10. **Auṣadhi:** Grains like Wheat, etc., which dry up when they ripen.
11. **Jalasah:** Plants that grow in water, like Lotus, Singhada, etc.
12. **Kuhan:** Plants that grow by breaking the ground, like Mushrooms (Chatrak), etc. 

Page #104:
---------------------------
[60] There are two types of trees according to the *Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra*: those with one seed and those with many seeds. Trees with one seed per fruit are called *Ekaasthik* and those with many seeds are called *Bahubijak*. Some of the names of *Ekaasthik* trees are mentioned in the *Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra*, while the rest are to be known according to the *Prajnapanasutra*. The names of *Ekaasthik* trees mentioned in the *Prajnapanasutra* are: Neem, Mango, Jamun, Kosamb (wild plum), Saal, Ankoll (walnut or pistachio tree), Pilu, Selu (Lasoda), Sallki (hand-loving), Monkey, Maluk, Bakul (Moulusari), Palash (Dhak), Karanj (Nakamal); Putrajiva, Arista (Aritha), Vibhitak (Baheda), Harad, Bhallatak (Bhilawa), Umbebharia, Khirni, Dhatki (Dhavda) and Priyal; Putik (Nimba), Karanj, Slakshna, Shinsapa, Asan, Punnag (Nagkesar), Nagavriksh, Shripurni and Ashoka. All these are *Ekaasthik* trees. Similarly, all other trees that grow in different countries and have only one seed per fruit should be considered *Ekaasthik* trees. 

The roots of these *Ekaasthik* trees contain countless living beings. Their tubers, stems, bark, branches and buds also contain countless living beings. However, their leaves contain one living being each. Their flowers contain many living beings and their fruits contain one seed.

The names of *Bahubijak* trees are mentioned in the *Pannavanasutra* as follows: Asthik, Tinduk, Kabith, Ambadg, Matuling (Bijaura), Bilva, Amalak (Pranvala), Pans (Ananas), Dadim, Ashvasth (Pipal), Udumbar (Gular), Vat (Bad), Nyagrodh (Big Bad); Nandivriksh, Pippali, Shatari, Plaksh, Kadumbari, Kastumbhari, Devadali, Tilak, Lavak (Lakucha-Litchi), Chatropka, Shirish, Saptaparna, Dadhiparna, Lodhra, Dhav, Chandan, Arjan, Nip, Kurj (Kutak) and Kadamb. Similarly, all other trees that have many seeds per fruit should be considered *Bahubijak*.

Among the names of trees mentioned above, some are well-known and some are specific to certain regions. Some names refer to the same tree but with different varieties. It is important to understand the different names used in different regions. The name 'Pamalak' (Pranvala) is found among the *Bahubijak* trees. It should be understood as referring to a specific type of tree other than the well-known Pranvala, because the well-known Pranvala has one seed and not many.

The roots of these *Bahubijak* trees contain countless living beings. Their tubers, stems, bark, branches and buds also contain countless living beings. Their leaves contain one living being each. Their flowers contain many living beings and their fruits contain many seeds.

##  [61 First Understanding: The Nature of Ordinary Plants]

Just like trees, various types of clusters, shrubs, creepers, vines, climbers, grasses, rings, greens, herbs, aquatic plants, and tubers are described in detail in the Prajñāpanā Sūtra.  _Here, the doubt may arise that if the roots, etc., of trees are inhabited by many individual living beings, then how do they appear as one body? The Sūtrakara has resolved this doubt with two illustrations:_

**The Mustard Seed Paste Illustration:** Just as when all the whole mustard seeds are mixed together with a binding substance, a paste is formed, but the mustard seeds remain in their own individual states. Although they appear as one due to being stuck together, they are still individual mustard seeds. Similarly, the body aggregates of individual living beings also remain in their own individual states, but due to being mixed together by a specific karma-like binding substance, they appear as one body.

**The Sesame Seed Cake Illustration:** Just as in a sesame seed cake, each sesame seed is separate in its own state, but the cake is one. Similarly, individual living beings, while being in their own individual states, appear as one body. This is the description of the individual living being plant.

**The Nature of Ordinary Plants:** 21. How are ordinary body plants? _Ordinary body plants are of many types, such as - potato, root, ginger, hiralī, sirīlī, sisīrilī, kittikā, kṣīrikā, kṣīraviḍālikā, kṛṣṇakanda, vajrakanda, sūrana..._

...and so on. These are broadly classified into two types, namely, those that are born and those that are not born.

**_Question:_**  Venerable Sir! How many bodies do living beings have?

**_Answer:_**  There are three bodies, namely, the oral body, the mental body, and the karmic body.

**_Explanation:_**  Just as in the case of external earth elements, the body's range of perception is immeasurable, extending for countless yojanas in all directions. Bodies are impermanent and constantly changing, lasting for thousands of years at most. They are subject to the three destinies: the lower realms, the middle realms, and the higher realms. This is the nature of external plants, this is the nature of stationary beings. [21] 

Page #106:
---------------------------
[62] One should know the following types of ordinary plant-bodied beings:  Jīvā-jīvābhigama-sūtra, Kanda, Khalluṭa, Kṛmirāśi, Bhadra, Mustāpiṇḍa, Haridrā, Lohārī, Snihu, Stibhu, Aśvakarṇī, Siṃhakarṇī, Sikunḍī, Muṣaṇḍī, and others like these. These have been said to be of two types in brief, namely: sufficient and insufficient. /  O Bhagavan! How many bodies have been said to be of these beings?  Gautama! Three bodies have been said to be: Audārika, Tejas, and Kārmaṇa. /  One should know all these statements like the Bādar earth-bodied beings. The special feature is that the perception of their bodies is from the smallest part of an inch to the largest part of a thousand yojanas and a little more. Their body structures are indefinite, and their duration is from the smallest part of a moment to the largest part of ten thousand years. They move in two directions and come in three directions. Each plant being is innumerable, and the ordinary plant beings are said to be infinite. This is the description of the Bādar plant, and with this, the description of the stationary beings is complete. /  Discussion: In a single body, infinite ordinary plant-bodied beings reside, are born together, their bodies are formed together, they take in the pudgalas of prāṇa and apāna together, and they breathe together. The food, breathing, etc., of the ordinary beings residing in one body happens together. /  The taking in of food, etc., by one being is the taking in of food, etc., by all beings, and the taking in of food, etc., by all is the taking in of food, etc., by one being. This is the characteristic of the ordinariness of ordinary beings. /  Just as a red-hot iron ball in fire becomes entirely red and fiery, so one should know the transformation of infinite beings in a single body in the form of a Nigoda. The body of one, two, or innumerable Nigoda beings is not visible. Only the bodies of infinite Nigodas can be seen. In this matter, the words of the Tīrthankara Deva are the proof. The Bhagavan says that there are innumerable spheres in a Nigoda body the size of the point of a needle, innumerable Nigodas in each sphere, and infinite beings in each Nigoda. /  In the present sūtra, many types of ordinary plant-bodied beings have been described. By mentioning the names of some ordinary plants, the Prajñāpanasūtra has been referred to for specific information. There is a detailed explanation of this in that sūtra. /  The characteristics of the Bādar plant and the ordinary plant, as mentioned in the Prajñāpanasūtra, are mentioned here because they are relevant and useful.

## First Understanding: The Nature of Ordinary Plants

**Identifying Ordinary Plants:**

1. A plant is considered ordinary if its root, tuber, stem, bark, branch, twig, flower, fruit, seed, etc., when broken, breaks evenly, in a circular manner, without any unevenness or twisting.
2. A plant is considered to have infinite lives if its bark is thicker than the wood (central core) of its root, tuber, stem, and branches.
3. A plant is considered ordinary if the broken surface of its root, tuber, stem, bark, branch, leaf, flower, etc., is circular and even.
4. A plant is considered ordinary if its knots or joints, when broken, produce powder.
5. A plant is considered to have infinite bodies if it has the same kind of cracks as the earth.
6. A plant with or without milk, whose veins are not visible, or whose joints are completely invisible, is also considered to have infinite lives. Flowers should be understood according to the instructions of the scriptures. Some have a countable number of lives, some have an uncountable number of lives, and some have infinite lives.

**Characteristics of Every-bodied Plants:**

1. A plant is considered every-bodied if its root, tuber, stem, bark, branch, twig, leaf, flower, fruit, and seed, when broken, show a "heer" (a specific type of unevenness) - meaning the break is not even but uneven and jagged.
2. A plant is considered every-bodied if its broken surface is not circular but uneven.
3. A plant is considered every-bodied if its bark is thinner than the wood (central core) of its root, tuber, stem, and branches.

All plants that do not possess the characteristics of ordinary plants mentioned above should be considered every-bodied plants.

Every bud (kislay) is infinite-bodied when it emerges, whether it is every-bodied or ordinary. However, as the bud grows and develops into a leaf, it becomes every-bodied from ordinary.

These plant-bodied beings are of two types: sufficient and insufficient. Those that are insufficient do not have their colors and other characteristics clearly defined. Those that are sufficient have thousands of varieties based on their color, smell, taste, and touch.

There are a million species of these plant-bodied beings. Every plant-bodied being has 10 lakh (1 million) species, and ordinary plants have 14 lakh (1.4 million) species. Insufficient beings are born from the shelter of sufficient beings. Where there is one sufficient being, there may be a countable number, an uncountable number, or an infinite number of insufficient beings.

One should understand that there are a countable number, an uncountable number, and an infinite number of insufficient beings compared to every plant, and an infinite number of insufficient beings compared to ordinary plants.

1. "Uggemana Ananta" (Infinite in origin). 

Page #108:
---------------------------
The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra, in its examination of the 23 gates concerning the Badar Vanaspatikayas, states that all statements should be understood as being similar to the Badar Prithvikayikas. The difference lies in the fact that the organization of these Badar Vanaspatikaya beings is diverse and impermanent. Its excellent penetration is said to be more than a thousand yojanas. It should be understood in comparison to creepers, etc., in external islands, and in comparison to lotus stalks in the ocean and pilgrimage sites.  It is the opinion of the elder teachers that the penetration of lotuses should be understood as the result of the Prithvikayas. In the Sthitidwar, it should be said that the excellent duration is ten thousand years. After the Gati-Pragati Dwar, the text is "Aparitta Ananta". This means that each embodied plant being is innumerable, and the ordinary embodied plant beings are infinite. Thus, O Ayushman Shraman! This is the statement of the Badar Vanaspati, and with this, the statement of the stationary beings is complete.

What is the nature of the Trasas? Trasas are said to be of three types, namely Tejas-kay, Vayu-kay, and Udara-Tras. What is Tejas-kay? Tejas-kay is said to be of two types, namely Suhum-Tejas-kay and Badar-Tejas-kay. What is Suhum-Tejas-kay? Suhum-Tejas-kay should be understood like the Suhum-Prithvikayikas. The special feature is that the organization of their bodies should be understood as being the size of a community of needles. These beings go only in one motion (Tiyancha-gati) and come from two motions (Tiyancha and humans). 

Page #109:
---------------------------
## First Understanding: The Statement of the Badar Tejaskaayikas [65]

These beings are each with a body and are countless. This is the statement of the subtle Tejaskaayikas. 

**25. What is the nature of the Badar Tejaskaayikas?**

The Badar Tejaskaayikas are said to be of many types, such as the fire of coal, the fire of flame, the fire of Murmur (Bhubhur), and the fire that emanates from the Suryakant gem, and other similar fires. These Badar Tejaskaayikas are, in summary, of two types: sufficient and insufficient.

**O Bhagavan! How many bodies are said to be possessed by these beings?**

**Gautam!** They are said to have three bodies: 1. Audarik, 2. Taijas, and 3. Karman.

The remaining Badar should be understood like the Prithvikaayikas. The difference is that their bodies are the size of a community of needles, they have three Leshyas, the lowest state is Antarmuhurt, and the highest is three nights and days. They come from the Tiryanch and humans, and only go to the Tiryanchgaati. They are each with a body and are said to be countless. This is the description of the Tejaskaayikas.

**Discussion:**

In this sutra, the Trasajeevas are said to be of three types: Tejaskaayikas, Vayukaayikas, and Udara As. Previously, it was stated that the Basajeevas are of two types: Gatitras and Labdhitras. The Tejaskaayikas and Vayukaayikas, who are called Tras here, should be understood in relation to Gatitras. In Tejaskaay and Vayukaay, there is unintentional movement, not intentional movement. Those who can move intentionally are clearly called Udara Tras, such as the Dwindriyadi Trasajeevas. These are called Labdhitras. Tejas means fire. Those beings whose body is fire are called Tejaskaayikas. These Tejaskaayikas are said to be of two types: Sakshma Tejaskaayikas and Badar Tejaskaayikas. The subtle Tejaskaayikas are those who have the उदय of the subtle karma and are present in all the lokas, and who... 

Page #110:
---------------------------
[66] The statement "killing a Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra does not result in death" should be understood like the subtle Earth-bodied beings. All statements in the consideration of the 23 doors should be understood like the subtle Earth-bodied beings. Especially, the body-structure of the subtle Tejas-bodied beings is like the community of Saiyas. In the Chyavan door, these subtle Tejas-bodied beings emerge from there and are born only in the Tiryanch-Gati, not in the Manushya-Gati. The Agam says, "The Nairyik, Tejas-kayik and Vayu-kayik of the seventh Earth, who have an infinite lifespan of countless years, do not die and go to the Manushya-Gati." In the Gati-Pragati door, the Tejas-kayik go only to the Tiryanch-Gati, and the Tiryanch-Gati comes from the Manushya-Gati and is born in them. Therefore, they are of one Gati and two Pragati. The Badar Tejas-kayik-Badar Tejas-kayik beings are those who have the Badar-karma arising. They have many types, such as Ingal, Jwala, Murmur, Yavat Suryakantmani Nisrit. The word Yavat should be understood to include Achi, Alat, Shuddhagni, Ulka, Vidyut, Ashani, Nirghat, Sangharsh-Samutthit. Ingal means fire like Khaira, etc., which is luminous without smoke. Jwala means flames or lamp-flames associated with fire. Murmur means fire particles mixed with ashes - Bhobhara. Achi means a flame not connected to the original fire. Alat means the round circle that appears when fire is applied to a piece of wood and rotated around, that is Ulmulk or Alat. Shuddhagni is the fire that enters into a lump of iron, etc. Ulka - a streak of light, a spark, moving from one direction to another. Vidyut - lightning that flashes in the sky. Ashani - fiery particles falling from the sky. Nirghat - thunderbolt or lightning strike related to Vaikriya. Sangharsh-Samutthit - fire produced by rubbing of Aranikashth or other rubbing. Suryakantmani-Nisrit - fire emanating from the Suryakantmani due to the touch of intense rays of the sun. There are also other such fires that are Badar Tejas-kayik. These Badar Tejas-kayik are of two types - sufficient and insufficient. The color, etc., of insufficient beings are not clearly manifested. The sufficient beings have thousands of types and countless Yonis in relation to color, smell, taste and touch. They have seven lakh Yonis. In the Nisra of one sufficient, countless insufficient beings are born. The consideration of the body, etc., 23 doors should be understood like the subtle Tejas-kayik. Especially, their state is from the lowest to the Antarmuhurt and from the highest to three nights and days. Food should be understood like the Badar Prithvi-kayik. 1.

## First Understanding: The Air Body

**What is the Air Body?** The Air Body is said to be of two types: **Subtle Air Body** and **Dense Air Body**.

**What is the Subtle Air Body?** The Subtle Air Body should be understood like the Light Body. It is characterized by its flag-like shape. These bodies move in one direction and come from two directions. They are each-bodied and countless in number, extending across the entire universe.

**What is the Dense Air Body?** The Dense Air Body is said to be of many types, such as the Eastern Wind, the Western Wind, and other similar Air Bodies. In summary, they are of two types: **Sufficient** and **Insufficient**.

**Lord! How many bodies are there for the living beings?** **Gautama!** There are four bodies: **Audaric**, **Vaikriya**, **Tejas**, and **Karman**.

**Their bodies are flag-shaped.** They have four accumulations: **Pain Accumulation**, **Passion Accumulation**, **Fatal Accumulation**, and **Vaikriya Accumulation**.

**Food is taken in six directions, eight directions, ten directions, twelve directions, and fifteen directions.**

**There is no dwelling place for the gods, humans, and the inhabitants of the lower realms.**

**They remain in the womb for three thousand years, and then they are born in one direction, two directions, many directions, and countless directions.**

**This is the Dense Air Body, and this is the Air Body.**

## 68] [The Sutra of the Approach of Souls and the Sutra of the Liberation of Souls / If there is no obstruction or hindrance, the reception of the six directions of pudgalas takes place, and if there is obstruction or hindrance, then sometimes the reception of the pudgalas of three directions, sometimes four directions, and sometimes five directions takes place / These souls are not born in the Deva-Gati, Manushya-Gati, and Naraka-Gati. Their duration is from the most inferior to an instant and from the most superior to three thousand years. The rest is as before / O Venerable Shraman! They have been called as having one motion, two motions, each having a body, and innumerable. This is the statement of the dense air-body and the air-body. The discussion is that the souls whose body is air are called air-bodied / These are of two types: subtle and dense / The subtle air-bodied should be known like the subtle luminous-bodied described earlier / The difference is that the body of the air-bodied is in the shape of a flag (Dhwaja). The dense air-bodied souls have been said to be of many types. The types mentioned in the Prajnapanasutra should be mentioned here / There, their types are described as follows: Purvavat - the wind coming from the east direction / Paschimavat - the wind coming from the west direction / Dakshinavat - the wind coming from the south direction / Udicinavat - the wind coming from the north direction. Urdhvaavat - the wind blowing in the upward direction / Adhoavat - the wind blowing in the downward direction / Tiryaagvat - the wind blowing in the diagonal direction / Vidishavat - the wind coming from the Vidishas / Vato-bhram - the wind blowing in irregular directions / Vato-tkarika - the stormy wind blowing as fast as the sea / Vat-mandalika - the circular wind, the whirlwind / Utkalika-vat - the wind mixed with strong gusts / Mandalika-vat - the wind starting from circular winds and mixed with strong gusts / Gunjavat - the roaring wind. Jhanjavat - the storm or the inauspicious and harsh wind that blows with rain / Samvartak-vat - the wind that carries away straws, etc., or the wind that blows during the time of destruction / Dhanavat - the dense, solid air that remains below the earth, etc., with the brilliance of gems / Tanuvat - the thin air that remains below the Dhanavat. Shuddhavat - the gentle wind or the wind filled with mosquitoes, etc. / Besides these, there are other winds of this type which are dense air-bodied. These dense air-bodied souls are of two types - sufficient and insufficient / The color, etc., of the bodies of the insufficient souls are not fully manifested, therefore, their distinctions are not made on the basis of specific color, etc. The sufficient souls have their color, etc., manifested, therefore, their distinctions are made on the basis of specific color, etc.

## First Understanding: Description of Audarik Trasas

There are thousands of types of Audarik Trasas. They have seven hundred thousand Yonis. In the shelter of a sufficient Vayukaya being, countless insufficient Vayukaya beings are born according to the rules. In the consideration of the 23 doors, including the body, these Badar Vayukaya beings have four bodies: Audarik, Vaikriya, Tejas, and Karman. There are four types of Samudhat: Vaikriya Samudhat, Vedana Samudhat, Kashaya Samudhat, and Maranatik Samudhat. In the door of position, one should know the position from the lowest to the Antarmahart and from the highest to three thousand years. If the food is without obstruction, it is of the Pudgalas of all six directions, and in the state of obstruction, it is sometimes of the Pudgalas of three, sometimes four, and sometimes five directions. Even in Lokanishkrut (the edge of the world), there is a possibility of Badar Vayukaya, therefore, the state of obstruction can arise. The remaining doors should be known like the subtle Vayukaya. In conclusion, it is said that O Ashyuman Shraman! These beings are going to be in the Tiryanch Gati only, and they will obtain the Tiryanch and Manushya Gati. They are each-bodied and are the measure of the countless Lokakasha regions. This is the end of the statement about Vayukaya.

## Description of Audarik Trasas

**27. Who are called Audarik Trasa beings?**

Audarik Trasa beings are said to be of four types, namely: Dviindriya, Triindriya, Chaturindriya, and Panchendriya.

**Discussion:**

The word 'Audarik' in the term 'Audarik Trasa' is a differentiator of Gati Trasa. The term 'Ourala Tasa' is used to indicate the difference from the Gati Trasa in the form of Tejas Kaya and Vayukaya.

Audarik means gross, primary.

Mainly, Dviindriya etc. beings are intended in the form of Trasa, therefore, they are called Audarik Trasa.

These are of four types: Dviindriya, Triindriya, Chaturindriya, and Panchendriya.

**Dviindriya:** Beings who have two senses, namely touch and taste, are Dviindriya.

**Triindriya:** Beings who have three senses, namely touch, taste, and smell, are Triindriya.

**Chaturindriya:** Beings who have four senses, namely touch, taste, smell, and sight, are Chaturindriya.

**Panchendriya:** Beings who have five senses, namely touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing, are Panchendriya beings.

It has been said earlier that this division of senses is with respect to Dravyaindriyas, not with respect to Bhavaindriyas. 

Page #114:
---------------------------
[70] [Jivajjovaabhigamsutra Dwiindriya-varnan 28. What are the Dwiindriya Jivas? Dwiindriya Jivas are of many types, such as Pulaakrimik to Samudralikha. There are many other types of Dwiindriya Jivas. These are broadly classified into two types, namely, Paryapt and Aparyapt.  

Bante! How many types of bodies do Jivas have? Gotama! There are three types of bodies - Oral, Tey, and Kamma. 

Bante! How many types of body-acquisitions do Jivas have? 

Just like the number of fingers in a hand, there are twelve yojanas in the body. There are Chevattasanghaya, Hundasanthiya, four Kasayas, four Sannaos, three Lesamos, two Indriyas, Samugdhaaya-veyana, Kasaya, Marantiya, No Sani, Asanni, Napusakavevaga, five Pajjattios, five Apajjattios, Sammaditti also, Micchavitti also, Jo Sammimicchavitti, No Ohi Dasano, No Chakkhudansani, Bhachakkhudansani, Go Kevaladansani. 

Bante! Are Jivas Gnani or Agnani? Gotama! They are both Gnani and Agnani. They are both Niyama Dunaani, such as Praminibhohiyapani Suyanaano. Those who are Agnani are Niyama Duaani, Matiagnaani, and Suyagnaani. They are not Manajogi, Vajjogi, or Kayajogi. They are both Sagarovautta and Anagarovautta. Their Ahar is Niyama Chhadasi. Their Uvvaao is in Tirya-Manusse, Neraiya, Dev, Asankhejjavasaauy, and Vajjesu. They live for twelve years, just like the time it takes for the sun to set. They die both with and without Samoh. Where do they go? They go to Neraiya, Dev, Asankhejjavasaauy, and Vajjesu. They are Dugatiya, Duaagatiya, and Paritta Asankhejj. This is the Dwiindriya. [28] 

Page #115:
---------------------------
## First Understanding: Description of Two-Sensed Beings

**O Bhagavan!** How many bodies are said to be of these beings? **Gautama:** Three bodies are said to be, namely - Odaric, Tejas and Karman.

**O Bhagavan!** How much is the perception of the body of these beings said to be? **Gautama:** From the lowest, an immeasurable part of an angul, and from the highest, twelve yojanas.

These beings have Sewart-Sanhanan and Hund-Sansthan. They have four Kshayas, four Sanjnas, three Leshyas and two Indriyas. They have three Samudghatas - Vedana, Kshaya and Maranatik.

These beings are not Sanjni, they are Asanjni. They are Napunsakaved-wala. They have five Paryaptis and five Aparyaptis.

They are both Samyagdristi and Mithyadristi, but not Samyagmithyadristi (mixed vision). They are not Avadhi-darshan-wala, not Chakshu-darshan-wala, they are Achakshu-darshan-wala, not केवलदर्शन-wala.

**O Bhagavan!** Are these beings knowledgeable or ignorant? **Gautama:** They are both knowledgeable and ignorant. Those who are knowledgeable are, by rule, two knowledgeable - Mati-gyani and Shruti-gyani.

Those who are ignorant are, by rule, two ignorant - Mati-agyani and Shruti-agyani.

These beings are not Manoyog-wala, they are Vachan-yog and Kay-yog-wala. These beings are both Sakar-upayog-wala and Anakar-upayog-wala.

The food of these beings is, by rule, the Pudgalas of six directions. Their Upapat (origin from another birth) is from the rest of the Tiryanch and humans, except for the Naryik, Dev and those with an age of countless years.

Their state is from the lowest, Antarmuhurt, and from the highest, twelve years. They die both by Samvahat and Asamvahat from the Maranatik Samudghata.

**O Bhagavan!** Where do they go after death? **Gautama:** Except for the Naryik, Dev and Tiryanch humans with an age of countless years, they go to the rest of the Tiryanch humans.

Therefore, these beings go in two Gatis, they come from two Gatis, they are each-bodied and countless. This is the description of the two-sensed beings.

**Discussion:** While describing the types of two-sensed beings, the Sutrakar has said "Pulakrimi Yavat Samudralikasha".

The word "Yavat" here should be taken to include all those types of beings that are mentioned in the Prajnapanasutra under the authority of two-sensed beings. The complete types are as follows:

* **Pulakrimi:** Worms born in the excrement door.
* **Kukshikrimi:** Worms born in the Kukshi (abdomen).
* **Gandoayalaka:** Gindola. 

Page #116:
---------------------------
[72] One should know the following according to the traditions of the people: Jeevajeevaabhigamsutra Golo, Nupur, Saumangalaka, Vanshimukh, Soochimukh, Gojalouka, Jalouka (leech), Jaalayushk. Shankha - conch shells born in the sea. Shankhanak - small conch shells born in the sea. Ghulla-Ghonghha / Khulla - small conch shells shaped like sea shells / Varata Kaudias / Sautrika, Maulika, Kalluyavas, Ekavart, Dwi-Pravart, Nandikavart, Shambuk, Matruvah - these are all different types of conch shells. Sippisamputa - clams / Chandanak - axis (dice) / Samudralikasha - a type of worm / these and other similar worms born in dead bodies should be understood as Dwindriya. These Dwindriya beings should be understood as two types based on sufficient and insufficient. The examination of the 23 doors of the body, etc., should be known in this way:
* **Shariradwar** - These beings have three bodies: Audarik, Taijas and Karman.
* **Avgahanaadwar** - The body-avgahana of these beings is from the countless parts of an angul to the twelve yojanas.
* **Sanhanandwar** - These beings have a chedavati-sevatam sanhanan. Here, the main sanhanan should be taken, not the formal one. Because these beings have bones.
* **Sansthanadwar** - These beings have a hand-sansthan.
* **Kashayadwar** - All four kshayas are found in them.
* **Sanjnaadwar** - They have all four aharad, etc., sanjnas.
* **Lenyadwar** - These beings have three leshyas from the beginning: Krishna, Neel, Kapoth.
* **Indriyadwar** - They have two senses: touch and taste.
* **Samudghatadwar** - They have three samudghats: pain, kshaya and maranantik samudghat.
* **Sanjnaadwar** - These beings are not sanjni / they are asanjni.
* **Vedadwar** - These beings are napunsakavedi. They are sammuchim and those who are sammuchim are napunsak.
* **Tattvarth Sutra** says: "Narak and sammuchim are napunsakavedi."
* **Paryaptidwar** - These beings have five paryaptis compared to sufficient beings and five aparyaptis compared to insufficient beings.
* **Drishtidwar** - These beings are both samyagdristi and mithyadristi, but not mishradristi. This is clear: 1. Narakasamuchhino napunsakanni / Tattvarth Su. Pr. 2 Su. 50

## First Understanding: Description of the Two-Sensory Beings [73]

Just as a bell, when struck, produces a great sound, and that sound gradually diminishes, reaching only the hanging point, similarly, a being falling from Samyaktva gradually falls, reaching the state of Saasvadan Samyaktva. Some beings with Saasvadan Samyaktva, upon death, are born as Two-Sensory beings. Therefore, due to the possibility of Saasvadan Samyaktva for a short time in the inadequate state, they possess Samyagdristi. 

For the rest of the time, they have Mithyadristi, and due to the nature of existence, they do not have Tatharoop Parinam, hence they do not possess Misradristi, and no being with Misradristi is born among them. Because, "A being with Misradristi does not die in that state," is a statement from the scriptures.

**Darshan Dwaar:** They possess only Achakṣudarshan, not Chakshudarshan, Avadhi Darshan, or Keval Darshan.

**Gyan Dwaar:** They are both knowledgeable and ignorant. They are knowledgeable in terms of Saasvadan Samyaktva. They are knowledgeable in Mati Gyan and Shruta Gyan. They are ignorant in terms of Mithyadristi. They are ignorant in Mati Agyan and Shruta Agyan.

**Yog Dwaar:** They are not Manoyogi, but they are Vachanayogi and Kayayogi.

**Upayog Dwaar:** These beings are both Sakar Upayog and Anakar Upayog.

**Aahar Dwaar:** These beings consume the six directions of Pudgal according to the rules.

**Dwiindriyadi beings are only in the Trasanadi, therefore the question of Vyaghat does not arise.**

**Upapat:** These beings are born from the remaining Tiryanch-Manushya Gati, excluding Devas, Narakas, and Tiryanch-Manushyas with an immeasurable lifespan.

**Sthiti:** The state of these beings ranges from the lowest Antarmuhurt to the highest twelve years.

**Samavahat Dwaar:** They die both in Samavahat and Asamavahat.

**Chyavan Dwaar:** These beings, upon death, are born as Tiryanch-Manushya, excluding Devas, Narakas, and Tiryanch-Manushyas with an immeasurable lifespan.

**Gati-Agati Dwaar:** These beings move in two Gatis and come from two Gatis. They are each Shariri and countless.

**There are as many Dwiindriya beings as there are Akash Pradesh in the long, single-region category above and below the Ghnikrit Lok. This is the proof of their countless number.**

**Because even Prasankhyat is of countless types.**

**These Dwiindriya beings, with their adequate and inadequate states, have a total of seven lakh Jati Kulkodi, Yoni-prominent.**

**According to the ancient teachers, the Tiryanch Gati should be understood from the Jatipad. Its Kuls are: Krimi, Keet, Vrischika, etc. These Kuls are Yoni-prominent, meaning that there are many Kuls in a single Yoni.**

**For example, in a single Yoni of cow dung or a piece of wood, there are Krimi, Keet, and Vrischika Kuls, etc.**

**Similarly, in a single Yoni, there are...**

**"N Sammmiicho Kunai Kaalam" - according to this statement...**

---------------------------
The Jiva's approach to the world is based on the principle of "Avantaar Jaatibhed" (differentiation of species), which leads to a flow of births in various species. There are seven lakh species of Dwindriya (two-sense) beings, each with its own unique form of existence. This is the description of Dwindriya beings. 

The description of Triindriya (three-sense) beings begins from verse 29. What are Triindriya beings? Triindriya beings are said to be of many types, such as: Aupayik, Rohini, Hastshishonda, and others similar to them. These are broadly classified into two types: Paryapt (sufficient) and Aparyapt (insufficient). 

Similarly, all the descriptions given for Dwindriya beings should be applied to Triindriya beings. The unique characteristic of Triindriya beings is that their lifespan is three kos (a unit of distance), they have three senses, and their lifespan ranges from a single moment to fifty nights and days. 

All the descriptions given for Dwindriya beings should be applied to Triindriya beings, including those that are described as having two movements, two forward movements, each with a body, and countless others. This is the description of Triindriya beings. 

**Explanation:**

Triindriya beings are those who possess three senses: touch, taste, and smell. They are classified into many types. The Prajnapanasutra lists their classifications as follows: Aupayik, Rohini, Kanthu (caterpillar), Pipilika (ant), Uddeshak, Uddehika (termite), Utkalik, Utpad, Utkat, Trinaahar (grass-eating), Kasthahar (wood-eating), Maluk, Patraahar (leaf-eating), Trina Vrintik, Patra Vrintik, Pushpa Vrintik, Phal Vrintik, Beej Vrintik, Tenduran Majjik, Trapushbhijik, Kapas Sthibhijak, Hillik, Jhillik, Jhigir (shrimp), Kigirit, Bahuk, Laghuk, Subhag, Sauvastik, Shukavritt, Indrakaayik, Indragop (silk worm), Urulunchk, Kusthalvahak, Yuka (louse), Halahal, Pishuk (flea or bedbug), Shatpadika (centipede), Gomhi (earwig), and Hastshishonda. 

Some of these types of Triindriya beings are well-known. The rest should be understood based on specific regions or traditions. These Triindriya beings are classified into two types: Paryapt (sufficient) and Aparyapt (insufficient). All the descriptions given earlier apply to them.

## First Understanding: The Statement of Four-Sensed Beings [75]

They should be known as similar to the two-sensed beings / The same statement should be made in the thirty-three gates, only the difference is as follows: The body's comprehension - the body's comprehension of the four-sensed beings is excellent, three kos. Sensory gate - these beings have three senses. Position gate - their position is from the lowest to the moment of death and the highest is fifty nights and days. The rest of the statement should be made as they are of two motions and two progressions, they are each embodied and they are countless / They have eight lakh कुलकोडी / This is the statement of the three-sensed beings. The statement of the four-sensed beings is from 30. To what house? The four-sensed beings are of many types, such as the blind, the offspring, even the dung beetle, and other beings of this type / These are briefly of two types - sufficient and insufficient / O Bhagavan! How many bodies are said to be of these beings? Gautama! Three bodies are said to be. Thus, the previous statement should be made / The special feature is that their excellent body-comprehension is four kos, they have four senses, they are sighted and blind. Their position is excellent, six months / The rest of the statement should be made like the three-sensed beings, as they are said to be countless / This is the statement of the four-sensed beings. 

**Discussion:** In the Prajñāpanā Sūtra, the distinctions of the four-sensed beings are described as follows: Blind, offspring (eyed), fly, mosquito, insect (locust), butterfly, beetle, rooster, hen, Nanda-vart, lizard, black-winged, blue-winged, red-winged, green-winged, white-winged, painted-winged, variegated-winged, ...

The Jiva-Jiva-Migam Sutra states that the **Bhavadharaniy** perception of the **Naryik** beings is from an **asankhyat** part of an **anguli** (finger) to **five hundred dhanush** (bows) in the **jghanya** (lowest) and **utkrisht** (highest) respectively. The **Uttarvaikriya** perception is from an **asankhyat** part of an **anguli** to **one thousand yojan** in the **jghanya** and **utkrisht** respectively. 

**Bhawan:** How is the body of these beings constituted?

**Gautam:** They do not have any of the six types of **sanhann** (constitution) because their bodies do not have **haddi** (bone), **nadi** (vein), or **snayu** (muscle). The **pudgal** that are **anishta** (unpleasant), **akant** (unwanted), **apriya** (unloved), **ashubh** (inauspicious), **amanojnya** (unacceptable), and **amanam** (unwanted) gather together to form their bodies.

**Bhawan:** What is the **sansthan** (structure) of their bodies?

**Gautam:** Their bodies are of two types: **Bhavadharaniy** and **Uttarvaikriya**. The **Bhavadharaniy** bodies are of **hund** (round) structure, and the **Uttarvaikriya** bodies are also of **hund** structure.

These **Naryik** beings have **four kshaya** (passions), **four sanjna** (consciousness), **three leshya** (tendencies), **five indriya** (senses), and **four samudghat** (initial stages). They are both **sanjni** (conscious) and **asanjni** (unconscious). They are **napuंसक** (neuter) **ved** (knowledge) holders. They have **six paryapti** (sufficiency) and **six aparyapti** (insufficiency). They have **three drishti** (vision) and **three darshan** (perception). They are both **gyani** (knowledgeable) and **agyani** (ignorant). The **gyani** beings have **three types of knowledge** according to the rules: **bhatigyani** (knowledge of the past), **shrutigyani** (knowledge from scriptures), and **avadhigyani** (clairvoyance). The **agyani** beings have either **two types of ignorance** or **three types of ignorance**. The two types of ignorance are **matiagyani** (knowledge from reasoning) and **shrutagyani** (knowledge from scriptures). The three types of ignorance are **matiagyani**, **shrutagyani**, and **vibhanga** (knowledge of the parts). They have **three yog** (types of effort), **two upayog** (types of use), and **six disha** (directions) of **ahar grahan** (food intake). They usually consume **kala** (black) **pradi** (primary) **pudgal** as food. They are born as **Naryik** beings after receiving **tiyanch** (animals) and **manushya** (humans). Their **sthiiti** (duration) is from **ten thousand years** in the **jghanya** to **thirty-three sagaropama** (ocean-like) in the **utkrisht**. They die in both **samavahat** (simultaneous) and **asamavahat** (non-simultaneous) ways. After death, they are reborn as **garbhja** (born from womb), **tiryanch** (animals), and **manushya** (humans). They do not go to **sammuchim** (heaven). Therefore, **Ayushman Shraman**, they are said to be **two gati** (types of movement), **two agati** (types of arrival), **each shariri** (body-possessing), and **asankhyat** (innumerable).

This is the description of the **Naryik** beings.

**Vivechan:** This Sutra describes the types of **Naryik** beings through **twenty-three dvara** (gates). There are **seven types of Naryik beings**: 1. **Ratnaprabhaprithvi-Naryik**, 2. **Sharkaraprabhaprithvi-Naryik**, 3. **Valukaprabha-Naryik**, 4. **Pankaprabhaprithvi-Naryik**, 5. **Dhumaprabhaprithvi-Naryik**, 6. **Tamahprabhaprithvi-Naryik**, and 7. **Adhasaptamapৃthvi-Naryik**. In short, these **Naryik** beings are of two types: **paryapt** (sufficient) and **aparyapt** (insufficient).

The **sharira** (body) **dvara** (gate) of the **Naryik** beings is as follows: They do not have **oudarik** (material) bodies. Their bodies are **vaikriya** (changeable) by nature. Therefore, they have **three types of bodies**: **vaikriya**, **taijas** (luminous), and **karman** (karmic).

Their **avagahana** (perception) is of two types: **Bhavadharaniy** and **Uttarvaikriya**. The **Bhavadharaniy** is the perception that is present from birth. The **Uttarvaikriya** is the perception that is created later in a **vichitra** (strange) form for the **vairi** (enemy) **narak** (hell) **pratighāt** (resistance) in the **bhavanter** (future life).

## [79 First Chapter: Description of Narakas]

The depth of the Narakas' descent into the Bhavadharani is an immeasurable fraction of an angul (finger width) at the time of birth. The highest depth is 500 dhanush (bows). This highest measurement is in relation to the seventh earth. Their depth of descent into the Uttarvaikriyika is an immeasurable fraction of an angul at the lowest and 1000 dhanush at the highest. This highest measurement is in relation to the seventh Naraka-bhoomi (hell). The highest depth of descent into the Bhavadharani and Uttarvaikriyika of different Narakas should be known from this table:

| Earth Name | Bhavadharani Depth | Uttarvaikriyika Depth |
|---|---|---|
| (1) Ratnapraba | 7 dhanush 6 angul 15 | 12 angul |
| (2) Sharkarapraba | 15 dhanush 12 angul | 31 dhanush |
| (3) Balukapraba | 31 dhanush 62 dhanush | 62 dhanush |
| (4) Pankapraba | 62 dhanush 125 dhanush | 125 dhanush |
| (5) Dhumapraba | 125 dhanush 250 dhanush | 250 dhanush |
| (6) Tamahpraba | 250 dhanush 500 dhanush | 500 dhanush |
| (7) Adhasaptamapৃথিবী | 500 dhanush | 1000 dhanush |

The bodies of Naraka beings are not made of any of the six types of sahnana (conglomeration). They do not have any veins (arteries) or nerves (small veins), nor do they have bones. The definition of sahnana is the accumulation of bones. Since Narakas do not have bones, the question of sahnana does not arise.

One might wonder that the Sewart sahnana was mentioned for the Ekendriya beings, but they also do not have bones. The solution is that Ekendriya beings have an Audarik (formal) body, and the Sewart sahnana is mentioned in relation to that body. In reality, only the Asthinichayatmak (bone-accumulating) is sahnana.

In Prajnapana and other texts, Devas (gods) are said to have Vana sahnana, but that is also said in a secondary sense and only as a formality. Devas have the power to uproot mountains, and they do not experience any physical exertion or fatigue in this task. Therefore, they are called Vajra sahnani (diamond-like). In reality, they are Asahnanani (without sahnana).

One might doubt that "special power is called sahnana." According to this definition, it might be possible to consider Devas as having sahnana in the main sense. This doubt is contradicted by the principle, because in the same sutra, the definition of sahnana is given as "Asthinichayatmak," and it is clearly stated that in the absence of bones, Narakas do not have any of the six sahnanas.

Again, one might doubt that if Narakas do not have sahnana, how does their body bind? The sutrakar (author of the sutra) answers this by saying that their body binds like the Pudgalaskandha (matter-aggregates). The Pudgal that is anist (unpleasant), akant (unfavorable), apriya (unpleasant), ashubh (inauspicious), amanojna (unattractive), and amanam (unworthy) becomes the form of their body.

---------------------------
## Translation:

[80] The commentator of the *Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra* has explained the meaning of terms like *anishta* (undesirable) as follows:

* **Anishta:** That which is not even desired, extremely unpleasant, not pleasing, having extremely inauspicious color etc., unpleasant, causing aversion upon sight, inauspicious - having bad color, smell, taste, touch.
* **Amanognya:** That which does not generate joy in the mind because its result is painful.
* **Amanam:** That which does not evoke interest.

**Sansthanadwar:** The bodies of hell beings are of two types: *bhavadharani* (those that sustain their existence) and *uttarvaikriya* (those that undergo transformation). Both types have *hundasansthan* (bodies resembling a dog). Due to their nature, the bodies of hell beings are extremely repulsive, like a bird with plucked feathers and neck, resembling a *rom-pakshi* (a bird with plucked feathers). While undergoing transformation, hell beings desire to have auspicious bodies, but due to the arising of extremely inauspicious *karma*, they are only able to create extremely inauspicious bodies, which are also *hundasansthan*.

**Kashayadwar:** All four *kashayas* (passions) are present in hell beings.

**Sanjnadwar:** All four *sanjnas* (types of consciousness) are found in hell beings.

**Lenyadwar:** The first three inauspicious *leshyas* (shades of color) - *krishna* (black), *nila* (blue), and *kapota* (grey) - are found in hell beings. In the first and second hell realms, *kapota* is present; in the third, *kapota* is present in some regions and *nila* in others; in the fourth, *nila* is present; in the fifth, *nila* is present in some regions and *krishna* in others; in the sixth, *krishna* is present; and in the seventh, *param krishna* (supreme black) is present.

**Bhagawatisutra** states: "In the first two hells, *kapota* is present; in the third, *misra* (mixture of *kapota* and *nila*) is present; in the fourth, *nila* is present; in the fifth, *misra* (mixture of *nila* and *krishna*) is present; in the sixth, *krishna* is present; and in the seventh, *param krishna* is present."

**Indriyadwar:** Hell beings have five senses: touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing.

**Samudghatadwar:** They have four *samudghatas* (types of suffering): *vedana* (pain), *kashaya* (passions), *vaikriya* (transformation), and *maranantik* (death).

**Sanjidwar:** Hell beings are both *sanji* (conscious) and *asanji* (unconscious). Those who die as hell beings after being born in the womb are called *sanji*, and those who are born from *samuchchima* (aggregates) are called *asanji*.

They are only born in the *ratnaprabha* (first hell), not in the subsequent hells. This is because the result of an inauspicious action performed without deliberation is limited. It is said that *asanji* beings are born in the first hell, reptiles in the second, birds in the third, lions in the fourth, snakes in the fifth, women in the sixth, and humans and fish in the seventh.

## First Understanding: Description of the Five-Sensed Transmigratory Beings

**The Gate of the Vedas:** Hell-bound beings are always eunuchs. 

**The Gate of Fulfillment:** They have six fulfillments and six unfulfillments. The commentator has mentioned five fulfillments and five unfulfillments due to the oneness of speech and mind.

**The Gate of Vision:** Hell-bound beings have three types of vision: 1. False vision, 2. Right vision, and 3. Mixed vision.

**The Gate of Perception:** They have three types of perception: 1. Eye perception, 2. Non-eye perception, and 3. Clairvoyance.

**The Gate of Knowledge:** They are both knowledgeable and ignorant. Those who are knowledgeable are, by rule, intellectually knowledgeable, scripturally knowledgeable, and clairvoyant. Those who are ignorant are intellectually ignorant, scripturally ignorant, and have fragmented knowledge. The meaning is that hell-bound beings who are unconscious are ignorant in two ways in the unfulfilled state and in three ways in the fulfilled state. Conscious hell-bound beings are ignorant in three ways in both states.

**The Gate of Yoga:** Hell-bound beings have three types of yoga: 1. Mental yoga, 2. Speech yoga, and 3. Body yoga.

**The Gate of Use:** Hell-bound beings are both corporeal and incorporeal.

**The Gate of Sustenance:** Hell-bound beings are not on the outskirts of the world, but in the middle. Therefore, they do not have any obstacles. Hence, they receive karmic particles from all six directions and mostly receive karmic particles of bad color, smell, taste, and touch.

**The Gate of Rebirth:** Hell-bound beings are born from five-sensed transmigratory beings and humans who have a lifespan of countless years, except for those who have a lifespan of countless years. They are not born from other realms.

**The Gate of Position:** The lowest position of hell-bound beings is ten thousand years, and the highest position is thirty-three oceans. The lowest position should be understood in relation to the first hell, and the highest position should be understood in relation to the seventh hell.

**The Gate of Simultaneous Death:** Hell-bound beings die both with and without simultaneous death.

**The Gate of Upward Movement:** Hell-bound beings, after leaving their state, are born as five-sensed transmigratory beings and humans, except for those who have a lifespan of countless years. They are not born as humans who have a lifespan of countless years.

**The Gate of Movement and Return:** Hell-bound beings, after death, go to transmigratory beings and humans. Therefore, they have two movements and are born from transmigratory beings and humans. Therefore, they have two returns.

O Venerable Ascetic! These hell-bound beings are all embodied and countless. This is the description of the Naryikas.

**Description of the Five-Sensed Transmigratory Beings:**

33. What are the five-sensed transmigratory beings? The five-sensed transmigratory beings are of two types:

## First Understanding: Description of Aquatic Creatures

**All living beings in the world, whether they are in the realm of the liberated or the bound, in the four directions, in the skies, among humans, in the realms of karma, not in the realms of no karma, in the inter-islands, in the realm of countless lifetimes, or in the realm of countless lifetimes, even in the realm of gods, up to the realm of the gods of the four directions, the two directions, and the realm of countless lifetimes, are all described as such.**

**What are aquatic creatures? Aquatic creatures are said to be of five types: fish, tortoise, crocodile, snake, and dolphin (sunsumar). What are fish? Fish are of many types, etc. This should be known according to the description of the knowledge. In this way, other types of fish, etc., all these aquatic creatures are five-sense, non-human, living beings, in short, they are of two types: sufficient and insufficient.**

**O Lord! How many bodies are said to be of these beings? Gautama! Three bodies are said to be: Audarik, Tejas, and Karman.**

**Their body's size is from the smallest, an immeasurable part of a finger, to the largest, a thousand yojanas.**

**They are those who endure service, have a body like a lump, have four passions, four types of consciousness, and five types of karma. They have five senses and three types of death.**

**They are not conscious, they are unconscious. They are eunuchs with knowledge. They have five sufficiencies and five insufficiencies. They have two types of vision, two types of perception, two types of knowledge, two types of ignorance, two types of yoga, two types of use, and their food is the six directions of dust particles.**

**They are born from non-human and human beings, not from gods and hell beings. Even among non-humans, those with countless years of life are not born among them. Humans with countless years of life in the realm of no karma and in the inter-islands are also not born among them. Their lifespan is from the smallest, an instant, to the largest, a previous kalpa.**

**They die both with and without the death-causing karma.**

**O Lord! Where are these five-sense aquatic creatures born after death? Gautama! They are born in hell, among non-humans, among humans, and among gods. If they are born in hell, they are born only up to the Ratnaprabha hell, not in the other hells. If they are born among non-humans, they are born among all non-humans, both those with a countable lifespan and those with an uncountable lifespan, both among four-legged creatures and birds.**

**If they are born among humans, they are born among all humans in the realm of karma, not among humans in the realm of no karma. They are also born among those with a countable lifespan and those with an uncountable lifespan in the inter-islands.**

## 84] The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra are born. If they are born in the Devas, they are born in the Vanavyantara Devas (not in the Praage Devas). ... These Jivas are said to be those who go to four Gatis, those who come from two Gatis, those who have every body, and those who are innumerable. This is the description of the Jalachar Samucchim Panchaindriya Tiryanchas. 

**Discussion:** (Sutras 33 to 35) The present Sutras have described the five types of Samucchim Jalachar Tiryancha Panchaindriya Jivas - Matsya, Kachhap, Makar, Graha, and Susumar, but have directed to the Prajnapanasutra for the types of Matsya etc. / The Prajnapanasutra describes these types as follows:

**Types of Matsya:** Shlakshna Matsya, Khavalla Matsya, Yuga Matsya, Bhibbhiya Matsya, Heliy Machch, Manjaria Machch, Rohit Machch, Halisaagar, Mogaravad, Vadgar Timimatch, Timingala Machch, Tandal Machch, Kanikk Machch, Silechchia Machch, Lambhan Machch, Pataaka Matsya, Pataakatipataaka Matsya, Nakra Matsya, and many more like these.

**Types of Kachhap:** There are two types of Kachhapas - Asthikachhap and Mansalakachhap.

**Types of Graha:** There are five types of Grahas - Dili, Vedhag, Mudug, Pulug, and Simaagar.

**Types of Makar:** There are two types of Makars - Sond Makar and Mritt Makar.

**Types of Susumar:** There is only one type of Susumar.

**All these Matsya etc. are of two types, according to the Parayapta and Aparayapta Bhed, of the Jalachar Samucchim Panchaindriya Tiryancha, etc. One should know this description as before. The consideration of the Sharira etc. 23 Dvars should be known like the Chaturindriya. / The special feature is that their Jghanya Avagahana in the Avagahanadvar is an innumerable part of an Angul, and the Utkrishta is one thousand Yojanas. In the Indriyadvar, they should be said to have five Indriyas. / In the Sanjidvar, they are Asanji, not Sanji - because of being Samucchim, they are not Samanaska (Sanji). In the Upapatadvar, they are born from the Tiryanchas and Manusyas, except for those who have an innumerable lifespan. In the Sthitidvar, their Jghanya is Antarmuhurta, and their Utkrishta is Purvakoti. In the Udvartanaadvar, they are born in all four Gatis. / If they are born in Naraka, they are born only in the first Ratnaprabha, not in the further Narakas. / They are born in all types of Tiryanchas. In Manusyas, they are born in the Manusyas of Karmabhoomi. / In Devas, they are born in Bhavanapati and Vanavyantara.

## First Understanding: Description of Terrestrial Animals

**Quadrupedal Terrestrial Animals:** There are four types of quadrupedal terrestrial animals, namely: single-hooved, double-hooved, ghandipad (elephant-like) and sankahapad (with claws).  All other similar quadrupedal terrestrial animals are also included in this category.  They are broadly classified into two types: sufficient and insufficient.  Their body size ranges from an infinitesimal fraction of an angul (finger width) to a maximum of 9 yojan (a yojan is approximately 8 miles).  Their lifespan ranges from a moment to a maximum of 84,000 years.  The lifespan of other aquatic animals should be understood in a similar manner.  These animals are capable of moving in four directions and returning in two directions, and they are both individual and innumerable.  This concludes the description of quadrupedal terrestrial animals, which are five-sensed, non-human beings.

**Reptile Terrestrial Animals:** What are reptile terrestrial animals?  There are two types of reptile terrestrial animals: snake reptiles and lizard reptiles.  What are snake reptiles?  There are four types of snake reptiles: ahi (cobra), ajagar (python), asaliya (non-venomous snake) and mahorag (large snake).  What are ahi?  There are two types of ahi: darvikar (hooded) and mukuli (non-hooded).  What are darvikar?  There are many types of darvikar, such as pashvisha (venomous) and others.  This concludes the description of darvikar.  What are mukuli?  There are many types of mukuli, such as divy (divine) and gonas (non-divine).  This concludes the description of mukuli.  What are ajagar?  There is only one type of ajagar.  This concludes the description of ajagar.  What are asaliya?  The description of asaliya should be understood according to the Prajnapanasutra.  What are mahorag?  The description of mahorag should be understood according to the Prajnapanasutra.  All other similar snake reptiles are broadly classified into two types: sufficient and insufficient.  The rest should be understood as before.  Specifically, their body size ranges from an infinitesimal fraction of an angul to a maximum of 9 yojan.  Their lifespan ranges from a moment to a maximum of 75,000 years.  The rest should be understood in a similar manner as aquatic animals.  These creatures are capable of moving in four directions and returning in two directions, and they are both individual and innumerable.  This concludes the description of snake reptiles.

**Lizard Reptiles:** What are lizard reptiles?  There are many types of lizard reptiles, such as goh (gecko) and nevala (mongoose).  All other similar lizard reptiles are also included in this category.  They are broadly classified into two types: sufficient and insufficient.  Their body size ranges from an infinitesimal fraction of an angul to a maximum of 9 dhanush (dhanush is a unit of length, approximately 4 feet).

[88] [From the most excellent position of the Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra, forty-two thousand years / Like the rest of the aquatic creatures, it should be said that these four-motioned, two-motioned, each-bodied and innumerable / This is the statement of the Bhujaga-Parisarpa Samuchchimas / Along with this, the statement of the terrestrial creatures is also complete. What is the form of the Khechara? Khechara has been said to be of four types, namely Charmapkshi, Romapakshi, Samudgakpakshi and Vittapakshi. What are Charmapkshi? Charmapkshi are of many types, such as Valguli, etc. Other similar Charmapkshi / What are Romapakshi? Romapakshi are of many types, such as Dhank, Kank, etc. Other similar Romapakshi / What are Samudgakpakshi? / These are of only one type / As said in the Prajnapan, it should be known / Similarly, Vittapakshi should also be known according to the Pannawana. These Khechara have been said to be of two types in brief - sufficient and insufficient, etc. as before / The special feature is that their Sharira-Avagahana is innumerable parts of an angul from the lowest and the highest Dhanush-Prithaktva / The position is the most excellent seventy-two thousand years. It should be known like all the other aquatic creatures, Khechara are four-motioned, two-motioned, each-bodied and innumerable. This is the description of the Khechara. Along with this, the statement of the Samuchchima Panchendriya Tiryanch Yoni is complete. Discussion - After describing the aquatic creatures in the previous Sutra, the Samuchchima terrestrial and Khechara have been described in this Sutra. Samuchchima Panchendriya Tiryanch terrestrial creatures are of two types - Chatushpad and Parisarpa / Those who have four legs are Chatushpad, such as Ashwa, Bail, etc. / Those who walk on their bellies or with the help of their arms are Parisarpa, such as Sarpa, Nakul, etc. / The two Chakaras in the Sutra are indicative of many differences in the self. Chatushpad terrestrial creatures are of four types - one-hoofed, two-hoofed, Gandipad and Sankahapad / The Prajnapan Sutra has described the types of these four, which are as follows: One-hoofed are of many types, such as - Ashwa, Ashwatara (Khechara), Ghotak (horse), Gardabha, Gorakshar, Kandalak, Shrikandalak and Avartak, etc. / Two-hoofed are of many types, such as - Ont, Bail, Gavaya (blue cow), Rojh, Pashuk, Mahish (buffalo), Mrig, Sambhar, Baraha, Aj (goat), Elk (sheep or goat), Ruru, Sarbha, Chamar (chamari cow), Kurang, Gokarn, etc. / _ Gandopad - Gandi means Eran / Those who have feet like Eran are Gandipad. These are of many types, such as - Hathi, Hastiputanak, Matkun Hasti (small stature elephant without teeth), Khadgi and Genda /

## First Understanding: Description of Terrestrial Animals [89 Sankapa-Those who have large claws on their feet are Sankapa. For example, dog, lion, etc. / Sankapa are of many types, such as lion, tiger, Dvipaka (leopard), bear, Tarasa, Parashara, Shrigala (jackal), Vidala (cat), Shvana, Kolasvana, Kokantika (fox), Shashaka (rabbit), cheetah and Chittala (chital) etc. / In these quadruped terrestrial animals, the distinction between sufficient and insufficient and the consideration of the aforementioned 23 doors should be known in the same way as aquatic animals, only the difference is as follows. Their body's depth is countless parts of the smallest finger and the best Gavyu-prithaktva (two kos to nine kos) / In the Agam, the meaning of prithaktva is from two to nine. Their duration is the smallest in the form of Antarmuhurta and the best is eighty-four thousand years. The rest of the description is the same as that of aquatic animals / As long as they are those who go in all four directions, those who come from two directions, those who have every body and those who are countless / _ Pariserpa terrestrial animals - those who move on the strength of their belly and arms are called Pariserpa / They are divided into two types - Uragpariserpa and Bhujagpariserpa / Uragpariserpa has four types - Ahi, Ajagara, Prasalika and Mahoraga / _Ahi - These are of two types - Darvikar, i.e., those with hoods and Mukuli, i.e., those without hoods / Darvokar Ahi are of many types, such as Ashivisha, Drishtivisha, Upvisha, Bhoga visha, Twachavisha, Lala visha, Ucchvasa visha, Nishvasa visha, Krishna sarpa, Shvetasarpa, Kakodar, Dahyapushpa (Darbpushpa), Kolaha, Meliminda and Sheshendra etc. / Mukuli, those without hoods, are of many types, such as Divyak (divine), Gonasa, Kashadhik, Vyatikula, Chitrali, Mandali, Mali, Ahi, Ahishalaka, Vatapataka etc. / Ajagara - These are of only one type. Asalika - In the Prajnapanasutra, there is such a description about Asalika 'Bante! How are Asalika and where are they born? Gautam! These Prasalika Uragpariserpa are born in the human region, in two and a half islands, without any obstacles, in fifteen karmabhoomis and ' in the five Mahavideha regions, in the Skandhavāras (camps) of the Chakravartis, in the Skandhavāras of the Vasudevas, in the Skandhavāras of the Baladevas, in the Skandhavāras of the Mandalika (small) kings, in the Skandhavāras of the Mahamandalika (kings of many countries), in the Gramaniveshas, in the Nagaraniveshas, in the Nigama (Vaniksavati) Niveshas, in the Kheta (Kheda) Niveshas, in the Karvat (small fortified) Niveshas, in the Mandala (where there is no village within two kos) Niveshas, in the Dronamukha (usually a place where water enters and exits) Niveshas, in the Patana and Pattana Niveshas, in the Akaraniveshas, in the Ashramaniveshas, in the Sanvadha (traveller's house) Niveshas and in the Rajdhani Niveshas, when their destruction occurs - वृत्ति 1. सुषमसुषमादिरूपोऽतिदुःषमादिरूपः कालो व्याघातहेतुः। 2. पत्तनं शकटैगम्यं, घोटकैनौभिरेव च  /  नौभिरेव तु यद् गम्यं पट्टनं तत्प्रचक्षते  //  - वृत्ति 

Page #134:
---------------------------
[90] When the Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra is present, then the Prasalika is generated in the aforementioned places in a Samuchchhim form. It has an Avagahana (at the time of birth) as small as an infinitesimal part of an Angula and an Avagahana as large as twelve Yojanas, and its length and width are also similar. It breaks out of the aforementioned land of Skandhavar Praadi. It is Asangni, Mithyadristi and Agnani and dies after experiencing the lifespan of an Antarmuhurt. It is not a Prasalika Garbhaja, it is only Samuchchhim. It does not exist outside the Manushya Kshetra. This is the description of the Prasalika. In the Mahorag-Prajnapanasutra, the description of the Mahorag is as follows: Mahorags have been described in many ways, such as: some Mahorags are one Angula in size, some are Angulaprithaktva, some are Vitasti (twelve Angulas) in size, some are Vitastiprithaktva, some are one Ratni (hand) in size, some are Ratniprithaktva (from two hands to nine hands), some are Kukshi (two hands) in size, some are Kukshiprithaktva, some are Dhanush (four hands) in size, some are Dhanushprithaktva, some are Gavyuati (Kos or two thousand Dhanush) in size, some are Gavyuatiprithaktva in size, some are Yojan (four Kos) in size, some are Yojanprithaktva in size. (Some are one hundred Yojanas in size, some are two hundred to nine hundred Yojanas in size, and some are even thousands of Yojanas in size.)* These are born on land but also move in water like land and also on land. They are not here, they are in the islands and seas outside the Manushya Kshetra. They are also born in mountains, Devanagari Praadi places in the seas. Not in water. There are also other types of Mahorags like this, which are ten Angulas in size. This Avagahana is based on the measurement of Utsedhangula. The measurement of the body is also based on Utsedhangula. Thus, Ahi, Ajagar, etc. Urahparisarp Sthalachar Samuchchhim Panchendriya Tiryanch Yoni जीव are briefly of two types: Paryapt and Ayaryapt, etc. The statement and the consideration of 23 Dvars should be known like the Jalachars. There is a difference between Avagahana and Sthiti Dvar. Their Avagahana is from an infinitesimal part of an Angula to Yojanprithaktva. Sthiti is from Antarmuhurt to Tirepan thousand years. The rest is as before, as long as these are four गति वाले, two आगति वाले, प्रत्येकशरीरी and असंख्यात. * The part in brackets should be understood in relation to Garbhaja Mahorag. 

In the Bhujagparisarp-Prajnapanasutra, the types of Bhujagparisarp are described as follows: Goh, Nakul, Sarat (chameleon), Shalya, Saranth, Sar, Khar, Grihakokila (house lizard), Vishambhra (Vasumbhra), Mushak, Mangus (squirrel), Payolatik, Kshirvidalika, etc. other similar Bhujaparisaarp Tiryanch. This Bhujagparisarp is briefly of two types: Paryapt and Aparyapt. The rest of the description should be understood as before. The statement should be made like the Jalachars in the consideration of twenty-three Dvars, only the difference between Avagahana Dvar and Sthiti Dvar should be known. Their Avagahana is from an infinitesimal part of an Angula to Dhanushprithaktva. Sthiti is from Antarmuhurt to Bayali thousand years. The rest is as before, as long as these जीव are four गति वाले, two आगति वाले, प्रत्येकशरीरी and असंख्यात.

## First Understanding: Description of Land-Dwellers [91]

There are four types of flying creatures (Khechar-Khechar): **Skin-winged**, **Hair-winged**, **Sea-winged**, and **Spread-winged**.

**Skin-winged:** These have wings made of skin. Their types are described in the **Prajnapana** as follows: **Vaggulī** (bat), **Jalauka** (leech), **Adilī**, **Bharandapaksi** (bird of prey), **Jīvanjīva**, **Samudra-vāyas**, **Karṇa-trika**, **Pakṣī-viḍālī**, etc.

**Hair-winged:** These have wings made of hair. Their types are described in the **Prajnapana Sutra** as follows: **Dhaṅka**, **Kaṅka**, **Kural**, **Vāyas**, **Chakravāka**, **Haṁsa**, **Kalahaṁsa**, **Rājahaṁsa** (red-beaked and red-winged swan), **Pādahaṁsa**, **Pāḍa**, **Seḍī**, **Vaka**, **Balākā** (flock of cranes), **Pāriplāva**, **Krauncha**, **Sārasa**, **Mesara**, **Masūra**, **Mayūra**, **Shatavatsa** (seven-hand span), **Gahira**, **Pauṇḍaroka**, **Kāka**, **Kāmanjuka**, **Banjulka**, **Tītara**, **Vartaka** (duck), **Lāva**, **Kapota**, **Kapijala**, **Pārava**, **Chiṭaka**, **Chāsa**, **Kukkuṭa**, **Shuka**, **Varhi** (a type of peacock), **Madana-śalākā** (myna), **Kokila**, **Seha**, and **Varillka**, etc.

**Sea-winged:** These fly but their wings remain like a chest. They are of only one type. They are not found in human regions, but in outer islands and seas.

**Spread-winged:** These have wings that are always spread out. They are of only one type. They are not found in human regions, but in outer islands and seas.

These flying creatures are of two types based on their **Sammūchhima** (aggregate) **Tiryach** (non-human) **Panchendriya** (five senses) **Paryāpta** (sufficient) and **Aparyāpta** (insufficient) characteristics. Their description is similar to the previous ones.

The examination of their body, entrances, etc., should be done like that of aquatic creatures. The difference lies in their entrances and positions. Their **utkṛṣṭa** (highest) entrance is **dhanuṣa-pṛthaktva** (bow-separation) and their position is **bahत्तर हजार वर्ष** (seventy-two thousand years).

These creatures are of four gaits, two progressions, each-bodied, and innumerable. There are two **sangrahaṇī** (collection) verses in some copies that describe their position and entrance. They are as follows:

**जोयणसहस्स गाउयपुहुत्त तत्तो य जोयणपुहत्तं  /  दोण्हं पि धणपुहत्तं समुच्छिम वियगपक्खीणं  // 1 //**

**संमुच्छ पुग्धकोडी चउरासीई भवे सहस्साई। तेवण्णा बायाला बावत्तरिमेव पक्खीणं  // 2 //**

Their meaning is as follows:

The highest entrance of **Sammūchhima** aquatic creatures is **thousand yojanas**, that of quadrupeds is **gavyu-ti** (kos) separation, that of **ur-parisarp** (reptiles) is **yojana-pṛthaktva**, that of **Sammūchhima** **bhujaga-parisarp** (snakes) and birds is **dhanuṣa-pṛthaktva**.

The highest position of **Sammūchhima** aquatic creatures is **pūrva-koṭī**, that of quadrupeds is **eighty-four thousand years**, that of **ur-parisarp** is **thirty-five thousand years**, that of **bhujaga-parisarp** is **forty-two thousand years**, and that of birds is **seventy-two thousand years**.

This is the statement about **Sammūchhima** **Panchendriya** **Tiryach-yonika** (non-human five-sense beings).

92] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra] What are the five-sense beings born from the womb (Garbhaja Panchendriya Tiryanch)? / The five-sense beings born from the womb are of three types, namely: Jalayara, Thalayara, and Khahayara. [37] What are the five-sense beings born from the womb (Garbhavyutkrantik Panchendriya Tiryanch)? / The five-sense beings born from the womb are said to be of three types, namely: Jalachar, Sthalachar, and Khechar. The description of the aquatic beings born from the womb is from 38, what are the Jalayara? / The Jalayara are of five types, namely: Maccha, Kachchhaba, Magara, Gaha, and Susumara. The differences are explained in the same way as the classification, as many as there are, so the total is of two types, namely: Pajjatata and Apajjatata. /  Bante! How many types of bodies are there for the Jivas? / Gotama!

## First Understanding: Description of Aquatic Creatures Born from the Womb [38]

What are aquatic creatures born from the womb? These aquatic creatures are of five types: fish, tortoise, crocodile, snake, and whale. The distinctions of all these should be explained according to the *Prajñāpanā Sūtra*, as follows:

These aquatic creatures born from the womb are briefly of two types: sufficient and insufficient.

O Lord! How many bodies are said to be possessed by these beings?

Gautama! Four bodies are said to be possessed by them, such as the *audārika*, *vaikriya*, *taijas*, and *kārmaṇa*.

Their body size ranges from an immeasurable fraction of an inch at the lowest to a thousand yojanas at the highest.

These beings have six types of cohesion, such as *vajrarṣabhanārāca saṁhanana*, *ṛṣabhanārāca saṁhanana*, *nārāca saṁhanana*, *ardhanārāca saṁhanana*, *kolikā saṁhanana*, and *sevārta saṁhanana*.

The structure of the bodies of these beings is of six types: *samacaturastra saṁsthāna*, *nyagrodha parimandala saṁsthāna*, *sādī saṁsthāna*, *kubja saṁsthāna*, *vāmana saṁsthāna*, and *huṇḍa saṁsthāna*.

All these beings have *kaṣāya*, four types of *saṁjñā*, six *leśyā*, five senses, and the first five *samudghāta*. These beings are conscious, not unconscious.

They possess three *veda*, six sufficiencies, six insufficiencies, three *dṛṣṭi*, and three *darśana*. These beings are both knowledgeable and ignorant.

Those who are knowledgeable are either those with two types of knowledge or those with three types of knowledge. Those with two types of knowledge possess *matijñāna* and *śruta jñāna*. Those with three types of knowledge possess *matijñāna*, *śruta jñāna*, and *avadhi jñāna* by rule. Similarly, the ignorant are also of these types.

These beings possess three *yoga* and both *upayoga*. Their food intake is from all six directions. These beings are born from *nairyika* as well as from the seventh hell.

They are also born from all other *tiryanca* except those with immeasurable lifespan, those in the *antarvīpa*, and those in the *akarmabhūmi*. They are also born from all other humans except those in the *akarmabhūmi*, those in the *antarvīpa*, and those with immeasurable lifespan. They are also born from the *devaloka* up to the *sahasrāra*.

Their lowest state is that of the *antarmahart* and their highest state is that of the *pūrva koṭi*. They die both by *samavahata* and *asamavahata* death. After death, they go to the seventh hell, all *tiryanca*, all humans, and the *devaloka* up to the *sahasrāra*.

These beings are of four *gati*, four *prāgati*, possess each body, and are innumerable.

This is the description of aquatic creatures born from the womb.

**Discussion:**

The *Prajñāpanā* instructs us to know the distinctions of aquatic creatures born from the womb. These distinctions, such as fish, tortoise, etc., have been explained in the discussion of the previous *sūtra*.

The description of sufficient and insufficient should also be known as before. The body and other aspects should be known as similar to those of aquatic creatures born from the womb. The difference should be known as follows:

In the case of aquatic creatures born from the womb, four bodies are found. 

Page #138:
---------------------------
[94] The *Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra* states that these beings also possess a *Vaikriya* body. Therefore, there are four bodies: *Audarika*, *Vaikriya*, *Taijasa*, and *Karmana*.  _In the *Avagahana-Dvara*, the excellent *Avagahana* of these womb-born aquatic beings should be known as a thousand *yojanas*. In the *Sanhanana-Dvara*, all six *Sanhananas* are possible for these womb-born aquatic beings. These six *Sanhananas* are: *Vajra-Rishabha-Naracha*, *Rishabha-Naracha*, *Naracha*, *Ardha-Naracha*, *Kilika*, and *Sevarta*. Their explanation has been given earlier in the context of the general explanation of the 23 *Dvaras*.  _In the *Sansthana-Dvara*, the *Sansthana* of the bodies of these beings is possible in all six ways. These six *Sansthana* are: *Sama-Chaturasra-Sansthana*, *Nyagrodha-Parimandala-Sansthana*, *Sadisa-Sansthana*, *Vamana-Sansthana*, *Kubja-Sansthana*, and *Hunda-Sansthana*. Their explanation has been given earlier in the context of the general explanation of the *Dvaras*. In the *Lenya-Dvara*, all six *Leshyas* are possible. The *Shukla-Leshya* is also possible. In the *Samudghata-Dvara*, there are five *Samudghatas* of the beginning. The *Vaikriya-Samudghata* is also possible. In the *Sanji-Dvara*, these beings are *Sanjnis*, not *Asanjnis*. In the *Veda-Dvara*, all three *Vedas* are present. In addition to the *Napumsaka-Veda*, there is also the *Stri-Veda* and the *Purusha-Veda*. In the *Paryapti-Dvara*, there are all six *Paryaptis* and all six *Aparyaptis*. The *Vrittikara* has mentioned five *Paryaptis* and five *Aparyaptis*. This should be understood in terms of the oneness of language and mind. In the *Drishti-Dvara*, all three ( *Mithya-Drishti*, *Samyak-Drishti*, and *Samya-Mithya-Drishti*) are present. In the *Darsana-Dvara*, these beings can have three *Darsanas*, because some of them may also have *Avadhi-Darsana*. In the *Jnana-Dvara*, these beings can also have three *Jnanas*, because some of them may also have *Avadhi-Jnana*. In the *Ajñana-Dvara*, these beings can also have three *Ajñanas*, because some of them may also have *Vibhang-Jnana*. 1. *Vajra-Rishabha-Narayan* is the first, and *Rishabha-Narayan* is the second. *Narayan*, *Ardha-Narayan*, *Kilika*, and *Sevarta* are the last. // 1 // *Rishabha* is the *Patta*, but *Kilika* is the *Muneyava*. *Uspa*, *Makkada-Bandha*, and *Narayan* are the *Viyanas*. // 2 // 2. There is also a reading of " *Sachi* ". The meaning of *Sachi* is the *Shalmali* tree. It is well-nourished from the bottom, but not from the top. 3. *Sama-Chaturasra*, *Nyagrodha-Mandala*, *Sai-Khujja-Bamanaya*, and *Hunda* are the *Sansthana* of the *Jivas*. These are the *Muneyavas*. // 1 //

## First Classification: Description of Terrestrial Embryo-born Beings [95]

**[Regarding Right and Wrong Belief in Clairvoyance and Discernment]** There is a difference between Right Belief and Wrong Belief in Clairvoyance and Discernment. The Right-sighted have Clairvoyance, and the Wrong-sighted have the same knowledge, which is called Discernment.

**[Regarding the Birthplace of Terrestrial Embryo-born Beings]** These beings are born from the seven hells, excluding the countless-year-lived Tiryanchas; from the remaining Tiryanchas, excluding the Akarmabhoomi Antarvipaj and the countless-year-lived; from the remaining humans of the Karmabhoomi, excluding the Akarmabhoomi Antarvipaj and the countless-year-lived; and from the Devas up to the Sahasrar Devaloka. Devas beyond this are not born among them.

**[Regarding the State of Terrestrial Embryo-born Beings]** Their lowest state is Antarmuhurt, and their highest state is Purvakoti.

**[Regarding the Progression of Terrestrial Embryo-born Beings]** They go to all the realms of existence except the Devas beyond the Sahasrar Devaloka.

**[Regarding the Movement and Progression of Terrestrial Embryo-born Beings]** Therefore, they have four movements and four progressions. They are each-bodied and countless.

**This is the description of aquatic embryo-born beings. The description of terrestrial embryo-born beings is as follows:**

**[Regarding the Classification of Terrestrial Embryo-born Beings]** Terrestrial embryo-born beings are classified into two types: those with two legs and those with four legs.

**[Regarding the Classification of Four-legged Terrestrial Embryo-born Beings]** Four-legged beings are classified into two types: those with one hoof and those with a split hoof.

**[Regarding the Classification of One-hoofed Terrestrial Embryo-born Beings]** One-hoofed beings are classified into two types: those with a single hoof and those with a split hoof.

**[Regarding the Physical Characteristics of Terrestrial Embryo-born Beings]** They have four bodies, and their size is measured in countless parts of an angul (finger width). Their height is measured in three palis (a measure of length), and they can reach up to the fourth earth.

**[Regarding the Movement and Progression of Terrestrial Embryo-born Beings]** The rest is the same as for aquatic embryo-born beings, with four movements, four progressions, and countless in number.

**[Regarding the Classification of Terrestrial Embryo-born Beings]** Terrestrial embryo-born beings are classified into two types: those with a chest and those with a belly.

**[Regarding the Classification of Chest-bodied Terrestrial Embryo-born Beings]** Chest-bodied beings are similar to the Asaliyavajjo (a type of bird) and are described as having a body size measured in countless parts of an angul (finger width). Their height is measured in thousands of yojanas (a measure of distance), and their lifespan is measured in Antarmuhurt. They can reach up to the fifth earth, and they are found among the Tiryanchas, humans, and Devas up to the Sahasrar Devaloka.

**[Regarding the Movement and Progression of Chest-bodied Terrestrial Embryo-born Beings]** The rest is the same as for aquatic embryo-born beings, with four movements, four progressions, and countless in number.

**[Regarding the Difference between Right and Wrong Belief]** The Right-sighted have a different understanding than the Wrong-sighted.

**[Regarding the Explanation]** ...

---------------------------
[96] From the Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra, what are the Bhuj-Parisarpas? The distinction is as follows: There are four types of bodies, the Avagahana is from the innumerable part of an angul to six kosas in the best case, the position is from the Antarmuhurta to the Purvakoti in the best case. In the remaining places, it is like the Ur-Parisarpas, going to the second hell. This is the statement of the Bhuj-Parisarpas. With this, the statement of the Sthalacharas is also complete.

## First Understanding: Description of Embryonic Aerial Beings [97 40]

What are aerial beings? Aerial beings are of four types, such as *charmapkshi* (skin-winged) etc., as described previously. Their *avagahana* (range of perception) is from the smallest fraction of an *angula* (finger width) to *dhanupuhutta* (bow-length) in the superior case. Their *sthiti* (duration of life) is from the smallest fraction of an *antarmuhurta* (interval between two moments) to an *asankhyeyabhaga* (incalculable part) of a *palyopam* (a measure of time) in the superior case. The rest is like aquatic beings, as described previously. 

Their special characteristic is that these beings go up to the third hell. This is the description of embryonic aerial beings, five-sensed, *tiryanch* (non-human) and *tiyanch* (born from three yonis). 

With this, the description of *tiyanch* is complete. 

## Discussion [39-40]

These sutras instruct us to understand the differences between terrestrial and aerial beings born from the womb, similar to the differences between *sammuchhim* (non-embryonic) terrestrial and aerial beings. In the *sammuchhim* terrestrial beings, the *prasalika* (a type of serpent) is described in the category of *urparisarp* (serpents with a chest). This should not be mentioned here because *prasalika* is *sammuchhim* and not born from the womb. 

Another difference is that in the sutra on *mahorag* (great serpent), the phrase "**joyanasayamp*i *joyanasayapuhuttiya* vi *joyanasahasamp*i" should be added. This means that the *avagahana* of *sammuchhim* *mahorag* is *joyanaprithaktva* (a measure of distance) in the superior case, while the *avagahana* of embryonic *mahorag* is *joyanaprithaktva* and even a thousand *joyanas*. 

In all other aspects, the description is similar to embryonic aquatic beings, except for the *avagahana*, *sthiti* and *udvartana* (rebirth). 

The superior *avagahana* of quadrupeds is six *kosas* (a measure of distance), the superior *sthiti* is three *palyopamas*, and their *udvartana* is from the fourth hell to the *sahasrar* (highest) heaven. This means that they can be reborn in all the realms between these two points after death. 

The superior *avagahana* of *urparisarp* is a thousand *joyanas*, the superior *sthiti* is *purvakoti* (a measure of time), and their *udvartana* is from the fifth hell to the *sahasrar* heaven. This means that they can be reborn in all the realms between these two points after death. 

The superior *avagahana* of *bhujparisarp* (serpents with arms) is from two to nine *kosas*, the superior *sthiti* is *purvakoti*, and their *udvartana* is from the second hell to the *sahasrar* heaven. This means that they can be reborn in all the realms between these two points after death. 

The differences between embryonic aerial beings, five-sensed, *tiryanch* are similar to *sammuchhim* aerial beings. Their bodies and other aspects are similar to embryonic aquatic beings, except for their *avagahana*, *sthiti* and *udvartana*. 

Embryonic aerial beings, five-sensed, *tiryanch*... 

Page #142:
---------------------------
## 98] The **avagahana** (range of perception) of **tiryanch** (non-human beings) is **dhanushprithaktva** (the distance a bow can be stretched) for the best. The **jghanya** (lowest) is **angula** (finger) measure for all. The **jghanya** state is also **antar mahatam** (innermost) for all, and their **utkrista** (highest) state is an **asankhyatava** (innumerable) part of **palyopam** (a measure of time). Their **udvartana** (progression) is from the third hell to the **sahasrar** (thousandth) **devalok** (heavenly realm), including all the living beings in between. This means they can be born in all these living beings after death.

Some manuscripts contain two **sangrahani** (collected) verses that describe **avagahana** and **sthiti** (state). Their meaning is as follows:

The **utkrista avagahana** of **garbhavyutkrantik jalachar** (aquatic beings born from eggs) is a thousand **yojan** (a measure of distance), **chatuष्pad** (quadrupeds) is six **kos** (a measure of distance), **urparisarp** (snakes) is a thousand **yojan**, **bhujparisarp** (lizards) is **gavyuprithaktva** (the distance a cow can be stretched), and **pakshi** (birds) is **dhanushprithaktva**.

The **utkrista sthiti** of **garbhajalachar** is **purvakoti** (a measure of time), **chatuष्pad** is three **palyopam**, **urparisarp** and **bhujparisarp** is **purvakoti**, and **pakshi** is an **asankhyatava** part of **palyopam**.

There are two verses that describe the **sthiti** of beings in hell. Their meaning is as follows:

**Asanji** (insects) can go up to the first hell, **sarisarp** (reptiles) to the second, **pakshi** to the third, **siha** (lion) to the fourth, **urga** (snake) to the fifth, **striya** (women) to the sixth, and **matsya** (fish) and **manushya** (humans) to the seventh.

Thus, the statement about **panchendriya tiryanch** (five-sense non-human beings) is complete. Now, we will discuss humans.

The discussion about humans starts from verse 41.

**41.  "What about humans? Humans are of two types, those who are **samucchim** (worldly) and those who are **gambhavak** (spiritual).**

**"Tell me, **bhnte** (venerable one), what do **samucchim** humans do?"**

**"They are **samucchim** (worldly) because they are attached to the world."**

**"Tell me, **bhnte**, how many **sariraga** (bodies) do living beings have?"**

**"They have three **sariraga**, namely:**

**1.  **Yojan** thousand **chhagga** (six) **auyayi** (a measure of time) and then **yojan** thousand. **Gavyapuhutta** (the distance a cow can be stretched) for **bhujage** (snakes) and **dhanushpuhuttam** (the distance a bow can be stretched) for **pakshi** (birds).**

**2.  **Gambham** (hell) **purvakoti** (a measure of time), three **palyopam** for the highest. **Urbhujage** (snakes and lizards) **purvakoti** and **palyopam** **asankhyatva** (innumerable) part for **yara** (birds).**

**3.  **Asanji** (insects) in the first hell, **sarisarp** (reptiles) in the second, **pakshi** (birds) in the third, **siha** (lion) in the fourth, **urga** (snake) in the fifth, **striya** (women) in the sixth, and **matsya** (fish) and **manushya** (humans) in the seventh. This is the highest **avava** (statement) of **boddhando** (the wise) about the hells.**

They have three bodies - Audārik, Tejas and Kārman /  (This is how the Dvāra-Vaktvyatā should be spoken.) This is the statement about the Sammūchhim humans /  What is the nature of the Garbhaja humans? Gautama! Garbhaja humans are said to be of three types, namely, Karmabhūmij, Akarmabhūmij and Antarvīpaj /  This is how the distinction of humans should be spoken according to the Prajñāpanāsūtra, and the complete Vaktvyatā should be spoken until the Chhadmastha and Kevali /  These humans are, in brief, of two types - sufficient and insufficient.

## First Understanding: The Exposition of Humans [101]

There are three types of vision found in humans. There are four types of philosophies. They are both knowledgeable and ignorant. 

Those who are knowledgeable are either two-knowledgeable, three-knowledgeable, four-knowledgeable, or one-knowledgeable. Those who are two-knowledgeable are, by rule, *matijnani* and *shrutajnani*. Those who are three-knowledgeable are *matijnani*, *shrutajnani*, and *avadhijnani* or *matijnani*, *shrutajnani*, and *manahparyavajnani*. 

Those who are four-knowledgeable are, by rule, *matijnani*, *shrutajnani*, *avadhijnani*, and *manahparyavajnani*. Those who are one-knowledgeable are, by rule, *kevalajnani*. 

Similarly, those who are ignorant are either two-ignorant or three-ignorant. They are also *manayogi*, *vachanayogi*, *kayayogi*, and *ayogi*. They utilize both tangible and intangible forms. They consume food from all six directions (in the form of *pudgala* absorption). They are born from all hells except the seventh hell, from all *tiryanch* except those with an immeasurable lifespan, from all humans except those born in *akarmabhumij*, *antarvipaj*, and those with an immeasurable lifespan, and they are also born from all gods. Their lowest state is *antarmuhurt* and their highest is three *palya* in duration. They die from both *samavahat* and *asamavahat* death. They are reborn in *nairyika* or in the *anuttaroppapatik* gods, or they attain liberation, ending all suffering.

O Lord! How many *gati* and *pragati* do these beings have? 

O Gautama! They have five *gati* and four *pragati*. They are both individual and numerous. 

O Venerable Ascetic! This is the statement about humans. 

**Discussion:** When asked about humans, the Sutrakar says that there are two types of humans: *sammuchim* humans and *garbhaja* humans. 

Regarding *sammuchim* humans, the question is asked: Where are they born? Where do they originate? In response to this question, the *Prajnapanasutra* is referenced. That is, the answer should be known according to the *Prajnapanasutra*. The *Prajnapanasutra* mentions this topic as follows: "In a human realm that is forty-five lakh yojanas long and wide, containing two and a half islands and seas, fifteen *karmabhumis*, thirty *akarmabhumis*, and fifty-six *antarvipas*, *sammuchim* humans are born in the following: 1) *Uccara* (excrement), 2) *Prasravan* (urine), 3) *Kaph* (phlegm), 4) *Singhan-nasika* (nasal mucus), 5) *Vaman* (vomit), 6) *Pitt* (bile), 7) *Mavad* (pus), 8) *Khoon* (blood), 9) *Veerya* (semen), 10) *Sukhe hue veerya ke pudgalon ka punah gila hona* (re-moistening of dry semen particles), 11) *Mrit jeev ke kalevaron mein* (in the corpses of dead beings), 12) *Stri-purush ke sangyog mein* (in the union of men and women), 13) *Gavanagar ki gateron mein* (in the sewers of villages and cities), and 14) *Sab prakar ke ashuci sthanon mein* (in all kinds of unclean places). Their lifespan is as small as an immeasurable fraction of an angul. They are *asangni*, *mithyadristi*, and lack all *paryaptis*. They die after living only for *antarmuhurt*.

##  Translation:

**102** [Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra] In this assembly of humans, the characteristics of the body and other doors should be known as follows:

**Body Door:** These have three bodies: Praudarik, Taijas and Karman.

**Avagahana Door:** Their Avagahana is as small as an innumerable part of the smallest and largest finger.

**Sanhanan, Sansthan, Kashaya, Lenya Door:** These should be known like the two senses.

**Indriya Door:** These have five senses.

**Sanjid Door and Ved Door:** These should be known like the two senses.

**Paryapti Door:** It has five inadequacies. These are Labdhi-A-paryaptak.

**Darpti, Darshan, Gyan, Yog, Upayog Door:** These should be known like the Earth-bodied beings.

**Pahar Door:** This is like the two senses.

**Upapat:** These are born from the living beings except for the Devas, Tejas-Kaya, Vayu-Kaya and those with an immeasurable lifespan.

**Sthiti:** These are born from the Jayanya and Utkrishta and are as small as an Antarmuhurt. The Jghanya Antarmuhurt is slightly larger than the Utkrishta Antarmuhurt. These die both in Samavahat and Asamavahat.

**Udavartana:** These are born after death in all living beings except for the Devas, Tejas-Kaya and those with an immeasurable lifespan.

**Therefore, in the Gati-Pragati Door:** There are two types of Gati and two types of Pragati (Tiryak and Manushya). These are each-bodied and innumerable.

**O Ayushman Shraman!** This is the description of the assembly of humans.

**Description of Garbha-J Manushya:** Humans born from the womb are of three types: 1. Karma-Bhumik, 2. A-Karma-Bhumik and 3. Antardweep-J.

**Karma-Bhumik:** Humans born in Karma-Pradhan lands are Karma-Bhumik. Where Karma is predominant, like agriculture, commerce, or the practice of Moksha, that is Karma-Bhumik. Five Bharat, five Airavat and five Maha-Videh - these are 15 Karma-Bhumis. In these lands, there are various businesses, professions, agriculture, arts, etc. for livelihood. In these areas, there can be practices and efforts for Moksha. Therefore, these are Karma-Bhumis. All social, political and religious systems exist in these. Humans born in these are Karma-Bhumik humans.

**A-Karma-Bhumik:** Where there is no Asi (weapons, etc.), Mashi (literature, business, arts) and Krishi (agriculture), etc., and where there are no efforts like Dharma-Aradhana for the practice of Moksha, such Bhog-Pradhan lands are A-Karma-Bhumis. Five Haimvat, five Haranyavat, five Harivarsh, five Ramyakavarsh, five Devakuru and five Uttar-Kuru - these are 30 A-Karma-Bhumis. Humans born in these 30 A-Karma-Bhumis are A-Karma-Bhumik. The means of enjoyment and consumption of these humans are fulfilled by Kalpa-Vrikshas, they do not have to do any Karma for it. In the five Haimvat and five Haranyavat regions, humans are one Kos tall, have a lifespan of one Palyopama, have Vajra-Rishbhanaraach Sanhanan and Sama-Chaturasra Sansthan. Their back is...

## First Understanding: The Description of Humans

**[103 types of humans exist]** They eat at intervals of one day and nurture their offspring for 79 days. In the five Hari Varsha and five Ramya Varsha regions, humans have a lifespan of two Palyopamas and a height of two Kos. They have Vajra-Rishabha-Naracha-Sanhanan (a specific type of head) and a square body structure. They desire food at intervals of two days. They have 128 ribs.

**[64 types of humans exist]** They nurture their offspring for 64 days. In the five Devakuru and five Uttar Kuru regions, humans have a lifespan of three Palyopamas and a height of three Kos. They have Bana-Rishabha-Naracha-Sanhanan (a specific type of head) and a square body structure. They have 256 ribs, eat at intervals of three days, and nurture their offspring for 49 days.

**[The term "Antar" means "middle"]** The islands in the middle of the Salt Ocean are called Antarvipas. There are 56 Antarvipas. The humans living in these Antarvipas are called Antarvipaj.

**[Location of Antarvipas]** These Antarvipas are located on the projections of the Himavan and Shikhari mountains that extend into the Salt Ocean. The Himavan mountain, which marks the boundary of the Bharat Kshetra in Jambudvipa, extends east-west into the Salt Ocean. Similarly, the Shikhari mountain, which marks the boundary of the Airvat Kshetra, also extends east-west into the Salt Ocean. Each end of these mountains is divided into two parts, resulting in two projections extending into the Salt Ocean. These projections are called "Daadha" due to their resemblance to elephant tusks. Each Daadha has seven regions inhabited by humans. Thus, there are 847 = 56 Antarvipas. The humans living in these Antarvipas are called Antarvipaj.

**[Four Islands in the Salt Ocean]** Three hundred Yojanas away from the Himavan mountain, in the Salt Ocean, there are four islands, each with a diameter of 300 Yojanas, located in the four directions: 1. Ekosak, 2. Prabhasik, 3. Vaishanik, and 4. Langalik.

**[Four More Islands]** Four hundred Yojanas further from these islands, there are four more islands, each with a diameter of 400 Yojanas, located in the four directions: 5. Hayakarna, 6. Gajakarna, 7. Gokarna, and 8. Shashkulokarn.

**[Four More Islands]** Five hundred Yojanas further from these islands, there are four more islands, each with a diameter of 500 Yojanas, located in the four directions: 9. Adarshamukh, 10. Medhamukh, 11. Ayomukh, and 12. Gomukh.

**[Four More Islands]** Six hundred Yojanas further from these islands, there are four more islands, each with a diameter of 600 Yojanas, located in the four directions: 13. Hyamuk, 14. Gajamuk, 15. Harimukh, and 16. Vyaghamukh.

**[Four More Islands]** Seven hundred Yojanas further from these islands, there are four more islands, each with a diameter of 700 Yojanas, located in the four directions: 17. Ashvakarna, 18. Singhakarna, 19. Akarn, and 20. Karnpravaran.

**[Four More Islands]** Eight hundred Yojanas further from these islands, there are four more islands, each with a diameter of 800 Yojanas, located in the four directions: 21. Ulkamukh, 22. Meghmukh, 23. Vidyutmukh, and 24. Amukh.

**[Four More Islands]** Nine hundred Yojanas further from these islands, there are four more islands, each with a diameter of 900 Yojanas, located in the four directions: 25. Ghanadant, 26. Lashtdant, 27. Gudhdant, and 28. Shuddhadant.

**[Total Number of Islands]** All these 28 islands are located in Jambudvipa, starting from the Jagati and extending 300 to 900 Yojanas away from the Himavan mountain. Similarly, there are 28 islands with the same names located on the projections of the Shikhari mountain, which marks the boundary of the Airvat Kshetra. Thus, there are 56 Antarvipas in total, 28 on each side.

**[The Lifespan of Antarvipaj]** The lifespan of the humans living in these Antarvipas is one Palyopam...

[104] In the countless parts of the Jeevajeevaabhigamsutra Pam, there live couples of humans with an age of a Yuga. In these islands, there is always a structure like the third arrow. The men and women here are beautiful and healthy. There are no diseases or disturbances. There is no master-servant relationship. They have 64 ribs on their backs. Their food is taken after one fourth of a Bhakt and consists of soil and flowers and fruits of the Kalpvriksha. The earth there is sweeter than sugar and the fruits of the Kalpvriksha are many times better than the food of a Chakravarti. The humans here are gentle, soft and straight, devoid of attachment and hatred. The couples here give birth to one couple (male and female) at the time of their death and nurture them for 79 days. Their death occurs from yawning, coughing or sneezing, not painfully. They die and go to the Devaloka. There are two types of humans in the Karmabhoomi - Arya and Mlechchha (Anarya). The names of many types of Mlechchhas like Shaka, Yavana, Kirata, Shabara, Barbar, etc. are mentioned in the Prajnapanasutra. There are two types of Aryas - Riddhiprapt Arya and Arddhiprapt Arya. Riddhiprapt Arya are of six types - 1. Arihant, 2. Chakravarti, 3. Baldev, 4. Vasudev, 5. Charan and 6. Vidyadhar. Arddhiprapt Arya are of nine types - 1. Kshetraarya, 2. Jatipraarya, 3. Kulmaarya, 4. Karmaarya, 5. Shilppaarya, 6. Bhashamaarya, 7. Gyaanarya, 8. Darshanarya and 9. Charitramaarya. 1. Kshetraarya - Residents of 25 and a half countries are Kshetraarya. In these regions, Tirthankaras, Chakravartis, Baldevs and Vasudevs are born. 2. Jatiarya - Those whose maternal lineage is superior (acceptable to the refined). 3. Kulaarya - Those whose paternal lineage is superior. Ugra, Bhog, Rajanya, etc. are Kulaarya. 4. Karmaarya - Those who earn their livelihood through refined business, etc. are Karmaarya. 5. Shilpaarya - Those who earn their livelihood through refined arts are Shilpaarya. 6. Bhashaarya - Those who use refined language and script are Bhashaarya. The Sutrakar has called those who use Ardhamagadhi language and Brahmi script as Bhashaarya. By implication, all languages and scripts are acceptable which are refined and have a soft and beautiful vocabulary. 7. Gyaanarya - Five types of Gyaanarya should be understood in relation to the five knowledges - Matigyaan, Shrutigyaan, Avadhigyaan, Manahparyaygyaan and Kevalgyaan. 8. Darshanarya - Two types of Darshanarya should be understood in relation to Saragdarshan and Vitragdarshan. 9. Charitramaarya - Two types of Charitramaarya should be known in relation to Saragcharitra and Vitragcharitra. 1. Detailed information is given in the Prajnapanasutra.

## First Understanding: The Description of Humans [105]

**Sragadarshan and Sragacharitra** refer to the vision and conduct that exist as long as the kshayas (passions) remain. 

**Vitragadarshan and Vitragacharitra** refer to the vision and conduct that arise with the pacification and weakening of the kshayas.

**Akashaya** (passionless) **Yathakyatcharitra** (conduct according to knowledge) is of two types: **Chhadyaasthik** and **Kaivalik**.

**Chhadyaasthik Yathakyatcharitra** is found in the 11th and 12th Gunasthanas (stages of spiritual progress), while **Kaivalik Yathakyatcharitra** is found in the 13th and 14th Gunasthanas. Therefore, **Yathakyatcharitra-Arya** (noble ones) are of two types.

This is a brief description of the **Prary-Manushya** (initial human beings). For detailed information, one should read the **Prajnapanasutra**.

These humans are broadly classified into two types based on their **sufficiency and insufficiency**, as described earlier.

**The 23 Doors of Humans:**

**Body Door:** Humans possess all five types of bodies: **Audarik** (physical), **Vaikriya** (subtle), **Aharak** (nutritive), **Taijas** (radiant), and **Karman** (karmic). Their **Avagahana** (perception) ranges from an **incalculable fraction of an angul** (finger width) to **three kos** (miles). They possess all **six Sanhanan** (types of physical structure) and **six Sansthan** (types of physical form).

**Kshaya Door:** They can be **Krodhakashaya** (anger-prone), **Manakashaya** (pride-prone), **Mayakashaya** (delusion-prone), **Lobhakashaya** (greed-prone), and **Akashaya** (passionless, compared to a Vitrag manushya).

**Sanjna Door:** They can be **Charsanjna** (four-knowledge) or **Nosanjna** (no-knowledge). **Vitrag manushya** are **Nosanjna** in **Nischya** (absolute knowledge) and **Charitree** (conduct) in **Vyavahar** (relative knowledge). They possess **ten types of Sanjna** due to the attainment of **Lokottara Chitta** (supermundane mind).

**Lenya Door:** They can possess **six Leshya** (types of karmic tendencies) or be **Aleshya** (free from Leshya). **Param Shukladhyani Ayogikevali** (the perfect, white-minded, non-liberated kevali) is **Aleshya**.

**Indriya Door:** They can be **Upayukta** (suitable) in the use of **five Indriyas** (senses) or **Noindriyopayukta** (not suitable, compared to a kevali).

**Samudghata Door:** They possess all **seven Samudghata** (types of mental states).

**Sanji Door:** They can be **Sanjna** (knowledgeable) or **Nosanjna-Noasanjna** (no-knowledge-no-non-knowledge). They are **Nosanjna-Noasanjna** compared to a kevali.

**1. Nirvana Sadhakam Sarvam Jneyam Lokottaraashrayam / Sanjnah Lokashrayah Sarvah Bhavanakurjalm Param //**

(All that leads to Nirvana is to be known, it is the foundation of the supermundane. All knowledge is rooted in the world, but the ultimate is the water of the sprout of existence.)

[106] [Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra] The Ved-Dwar (gateway of the Vedas) - all three Vedas are found and there are also Avedi (non-Vedic). Those with subtle Sampraya (subtle connection) and other Gunasthanas (stages of qualities) are Avedi. The Paryapti-Dwar (gateway of perfection) - there are five Paryaptis (perfections) and five Aparyaptis (imperfections). Five Paryaptis are mentioned due to the expectation of considering language and Manas-Paryapti (mental perfection) as one. The Drishti-Dwar (gateway of vision) - all three Drishtis (visions) are found. Some are Mithyadrishti (false vision), some are Samyagdristi (right vision), and some are Mishradrishti (mixed vision). / The Darshan-Dwar (gateway of philosophy) - all four Darshanas (philosophies) are found. / The Jnana-Dwar (gateway of knowledge) - humans are both Jnani (knowledgeable) and Ajnani (ignorant). / Those who are Mithyadrishti are Ajnani, and those who are Samyagdristi are Jnani. Among these, five Jnanas (knowledges) and three Ajnan (ignorance) are mentioned. It is as follows: some humans have two Jnanas, some have three Jnanas, some have four Jnanas, and some have one Jnana. / Those who have two Jnanas are those with Matijnana (knowledge of perception) and Shrutajnana (knowledge of scriptures) by rule. / Those who have three Jnanas are those with Matijnana, Shrutajnana, and Avadhijnana (knowledge of clairvoyance) or Matijnani, Shrutajnani, and Manas-Paryayajnani. Because even without Avadhijnana, one can be Manas-Paryayajnani. This has been said in many places in Siddha-Prabhut (perfect knowledge) etc. / Those who have four Jnanas are Matijnani, Shrutajnani, Avadhijnana, and Manas-Paryayajnani. Those who have one Jnana are Kevalajnani (omniscient). / When Kevalajnana is present, the remaining four Jnanas disappear. It is said in Pagam that when Kevalajnana is present, the Chhadmasthikajnana (knowledge of the veil) is destroyed. 'Only when Kevalajnana is present, the remaining Jnanas are destroyed.' There may be doubt here as to why the remaining Jnanas disappear when Kevalajnana arises? When these Mati etc. Jnanas are present due to the partial destruction of their respective coverings, then they should be present in greater quantity when their respective coverings are completely destroyed, just like the Charitra-Parinam (results of conduct). This is solved by the example of the emerald gem. Just as a high-quality emerald gem, due to its inherent nature, is covered with dirt etc., until its dirt is completely destroyed, a little bit of the gem is revealed when a little bit of dirt is removed. It is of many types due to being Kwachit (sometimes), Kadachit (perhaps), and Kathanchit (somehow). / Similarly, the Atma (soul) is naturally endowed with the power to know all things, but this nature is hidden by the veil of dirt. / Until the dirt is completely removed, the partial destruction of the dirt leads to the partial manifestation of that nature. It can be of many types due to being Kwachit, Kadachit, and Kathanchit. / It happens due to the difference between Mati, Shruta etc. When the entire dirt of the emerald gem is removed, the gem is manifested in one form. / Similarly, when all the coverings of the Atma are removed, the partial knowledge is destroyed. 1.

## First Understanding: Description of Devas [107]

"All knowledge (Kevalgyan) is expressed in one form." Those who are ignorant are also those with two ignorances and those with three ignorances. Those with two ignorances are those who are ignorant of intellect (mati-agyani) and those who are ignorant of scriptures (shruta-agyani). Those with three ignorances are those who are ignorant of intellect (mati-agyani), those who are ignorant of scriptures (shruta-agyani), and those who are ignorant of the nature of reality (vibhanga-agyani).

Through the door of yoga, a human being is a mind yogi (manayogi), a speech yogi (vacanayogi), a body yogi (kayayogi), and also an ayogi (non-yogi). In the state of Shaileshi, there is ayogitva (non-yogic state). Through the door of use (upayogadwar) and the door of food (aaharadwar), one should know like the two senses. Through the door of rebirth (upapatadwar), birth can occur in humans from all places except the seventh hell. There is no Nairyik manushya (human being) in the seventh hell. The principle states that the seventh earth, Nairyik, Tejaskaay, Vayukaay, and those with infinite years of life, do not become human beings after countless years. Through the door of position (sthiitidwar), humans are categorized into three types: inferior (jghanya), intermediate (antarmuhurt), and superior (utkrusht). Through the door of simultaneous death (samavahatadwar), humans die both with simultaneous death (samavahat) and without simultaneous death (asamavahat). Through the door of rebirth (udvartanaadwar), all beings are born in all hells, all animals, all humans, and all non-returner devas (anuttaropapattik deva). Some become liberated from all karmas and attain the state of Siddha-Buddha (perfect and enlightened), achieving Nirvana and ending all suffering. Through the door of movement and return (gati-agatidadwar), humans are those who go to five paths (including Siddha-gati) and those who come from four paths. O venerable Shraman! All these beings have bodies and are countless. The number of humans is countless kotis (a unit of measurement). Thus, the description of humans is complete.

## Description of Devas [42]

"Who are the Devas?" Devas are categorized into four types: Bhavanavasi, Vanamantara, Joisya, and Vemaaniya.

"Who are the Bhavanavasi?" 

**Question:** When the covering of the soul (aavaran) is removed, they go to the state of liberation (vijanta). How is it that they do not become liberated when the covering of the soul (aavaran) is removed?

**Answer:** Just as a gem, when its impurities are removed, reveals its true form, so too, when the karmas of the soul are removed, its true nature is revealed.

## First Understanding: Description of Devas [109]

**[Description of Devas]**

All those who are pleasing to the mind, they gather together in their bodily form - they transform.  O Bhagavan! What is the institution of Devas?  Gautam! There are two types of institutions: Bhavadharaniy and Uttarvaikriyik.  Of these, the Bhavadharaniy is the Samachaturasrasthan, and the Uttarvaikriyik is of various shapes.  Devas have four Kashayas, four Sanjnas, six Leshyas, five Indriyas, and five Samudghatas.  They are both Sanjnee and Asanjnee.  They are those with Strived, Purushaved, but not Napumsakaved.  They have five Paryaptis and five Aparyaptis.  They have three Drishtis and three Darshanas.  They are both Gyanee and Agnanee.  Those who are Gyanee are those with three Gyanas by rule, and those who are Agnanee are those with three Agnanas by Bhajana.  Both Sakar and Anakar are used in them.  They have all three Yogas.  Their food is to consume the Pudgalas of all six directions by rule.  They usually eat Pudgalas of yellow and white auspicious colors, with good fragrance, good taste, and good touch.  They are born from Tiryanch and Manusyas.  Their lifespan is from the lowest ten thousand years to the highest thirty-three Sagaropama.  They die both by Samavahat and Asamavahat from the Maranantik Samudghatas.  They do not get born in Naraka after leaving from there, they are born in Tiryanch and Manusyas as much as possible, not in Devas.  Therefore, they are said to be of two Gattis, two Pragatis, each Shariri, and countless.  

O Ayushman Shraman! This is the description of Devas.  Along with this, the description of Panchendriya has been done, and along with that, the description of Udara Trasas is complete.  According to the Vivechan-Prajnapanasutra, one should know the different types of Devas, which are as follows:

Devas are of four types: 1. Bhavanvaasi, 2. Vanavyantar, 3. Jyotishk, and 4. Vaimanik.

**Bhavanvaasi:** Those Devas who usually reside in Bhavanas are called Bhavanvaasi.  This should be understood in comparison to Nagakumar etc.  Asurakumar usually reside in Avasas, and sometimes also in Bhavanas.  Nagakumar etc. usually reside in Bhavanas, and sometimes also in Avasas.  

**[Difference between Bhavan and Avas]**

The Vrittikar has written, clarifying the difference between Bhavan and Avas, that Bhavan is round from the outside and square from the inside, and is shaped like the seed of a lotus at the bottom.  Whereas Avas is a Mahamandap with a place of the size of the body, which illuminates the directions with many Mani-ratnas.

There are ten types of Bhavanvaasi Devas: 1. Asurakumar, 2. Nagakumar, 3. Suparnakumar, 4. Vidhyutkumar, 5. Agnikumar, 6. Dweepkumar, 7. Uddikumar, 8. Dishakumar, 9. Pavanakumar, and 10. Stanitkumar.  

Each of these has two types: Paryapt and Aparyapt.  These are like Kumaras, fond of adornment, playful, with intense affection, and delicate, therefore they are called 'Kumar'.

**Vanavyantar:** 'Vi' means various types, 'Antar' means those who have shelter.  They are called Vyantar because they reside in various places - Bhavan, Nagar, and Bhavas.

[110] In the first Ratna Kanda of the Jeeva Jeeva Abhigamsutra, the text is contained in the middle section, leaving one hundred yojanas above and below, with a total of one hundred yojanas. These cities are also in the Tiryanch Lok, and their inhabitants reside in all three lokas. / Alternatively, those who dwell in various forests, mountain ranges, caves, and other shelters are known as Vananyantara Devas. There are different categories of Vananyantara Devas: Kinnara, Kimpurusha, Mahoraga, Gandharva, Yaksha, Rakshasa, Bhut, and Pichasha. / Each of these categories has two subcategories: Paryapta and Aparyapta. / / Jyotishka - those who illuminate and enlighten the world are called Jyotishka, meaning Vimanas. / Those who reside in these Jyotishka Vimanas are called Jyotishka Devas. / Alternatively, those who are radiant with the signs of the moon, sun, and other celestial bodies in their crowns are Jyotishka Devas. There are five categories of these: Chandra, Surya, Graha, Nakshatra, and Tara. / These also have two subcategories: Paryapta and Aparyapta. / Vaimanika - those who reside in the Vimanas of the Urddhva Lok are called Vaimanika. They are of two types: Kalpopanna and Kalpaatita. / Kalpopanna means where there are rules and regulations of the Kalpa, i.e., where there are rules and practices of Indra, Samanika, Trayastrish, etc., they are Kalpopanna. Where these practices or rules do not exist, they are Kalpaatita. There are twelve categories of Kalpopanna: 1. Saudharma, 2. Ishana, 3. Sanatkumara, 4. Mahendra, 5. Brahmalok, 6. Lant, 7. Mahashukra, 8. Sahasrar, 9. Anant, 10. Pranat, 11. Praran, and 12. Achyut. / Each of these has two subcategories: Paryapta and Aparyapta. / Kalpaatita Devas are of two types: Veyak and Anuttaroppapatika. / Veyak Devas are of nine types: 1. Adhastan-Adhastat, 2. Adhastan-Madhyam, 3. Adhastan-Uparim, 4. Madhyam-Adhastan, 5. Madhyam-Madhyam, 6. Madhyam-Uparim, 7. Uparim-Adhastan, 8. Uparim-Madhyam, and 9. Uparim-Uparim. / These also have two subcategories based on Paryapta and Aparyapta. Anuttaroppapatika Devas have five categories: 1. Vijay, 2. Vaijayant, 3. Jayant, 4. Aparajit, and 5. Sarvarthasiddha. / Each of these also has two subcategories: Paryapta and Aparyapta. / The distinction between Paryapta and Aparyapta in Devas should not be understood as arising from the Aparyapta Karma. Instead, it should be understood at the time of their birth. / The Siddhanta states: "Naraka, Deva, Garbhaja, Tiyanch, Manushya, and those with an immeasurable lifespan are Aparyapta at the time of their birth." The following is a description of the Devas' bodies and other 23 doors: Body Door - Devas have three bodies: Vaikriya, Taijasa, and Karmana. / Avagahana Door - The Bhavadharaniy Avagahana is immeasurable in terms of angulas from the lowest point and seven hands in length from the highest point. The Uttaravaikriyiki is immeasurable in terms of angulas from the lowest point and one lakh yojanas in length from the highest point. 2.

## First Understanding: Description of Devas [111]

**Sanhananadwar:** None of the six Sanhanans exist because Sanhanan refers to the specific structure of bones, and Devas have neither bones, veins, nor nerves. Therefore, they are Asanhanani. However, the Pudgalas that are desirable, radiant, pleasing, attractive, satisfying to the mind, soft, and charming, gather together in their body form - they transform.

**Sansthanadwar:** The Bhavadharaniy Sansthan is Samachauras Sansthan, and the Uttarvaikriya is of various types because they can shape themselves according to their will.

**Kashayadwar:** They have all four Kashayas.

**Sanjnaadwar:** They have all four Sanjnas.

**Leshyadwar:** They have all six Leshyas.

**Indriyadwar:** They have all five Indriyas.

**Samudghtadwar:** They have five Samudghatas: Vaikriya, Kashay, Maranantik, Vaikriya, and Tejas Samudghatas.

**Sanjidwar:** They are both Sanji and Asanji. Those who become Devas after dying from Garbhavyutkrantik are Sanji, and those who are born from Sammuchhimas are called Asanji.

**Devadwar:** They are Strivedi and Puvedi. They do not have Napunsakavedi.

**Paryapti, Drishti, and Darshanadwar:** Like Nairyayikas.

**Gyanadwar:** They are both Gyanis and Agnyanis. Those who are Gyanis have three types of knowledge: Mati, Shruta, and Avadhi. Those who are Agnyanis have either two or three types of ignorance. Those with three types of ignorance have Mati-pragyan, Shruta-agnyan, and Vibhanggyan. Those with two types of ignorance have Mati-agnyan and Shruta-pragyan. Those who are born from Asanjis have two types of ignorance. This is the meaning of Bhajana.

**Upayog and Aharadwar:** Should be understood like Nairyayikas. They use both Sakar and Anakar. They consume food from all six directions.

**Upapatadwar:** They are born from Sanji Panchendriya, Asanji Panchendriya, Tiryanch, and Garbhaja humans, but not from other living beings.

**Sthitidwar:** Their lowest lifespan is ten thousand years, and their highest lifespan is thirty-three Sagaropama.

**Samavahatadwar:** They die both with and without Maranantik Samudghata.

**Chyavanadwar:** When these Devas die, they are reborn in Earth, water, plant bodies, Garbhaja, and Tiryanch Panchendriya with a lifespan of Sankhyat years, and in humans. They do not go to other living beings.

**Gati-Agatiadwar:** Therefore, they are those who go in two motions and come in two motions.

[112]  "O Venerable Ascetic! These Devas are all embodied and are countless. Thus is the description of Devas. With this, the description of the five senses is complete, and the statement of the generous abodes is also complete.  

In the next Sutra, the Sutrakar describes the state of being of the stationary and the mobile, saying:

"Venerable! How long is the state of being of the stationary?"
"Gautama! From the least to the end of a muhurta, and from the best to twenty-two thousand years."
"Venerable! How long is the state of being of the mobile?"
"Gautama! From the least to the end of a muhurta, and from the best to thirty-three sagaropamas."
"Venerable! How long can a stationary being remain stationary?"
"Gautama! From the least to the end of a muhurta, and from the best to an infinite time - infinite Utsarpini and Avasarpini times. There are infinite worlds, countless Puggalaparitatta."
"Venerable! How long is the state of being of the mobile?"
"Gautama! From the least to the end of a muhurta, and from the best to an infinite time - infinite Utsarpini and Avasarpini times. There are countless worlds."
"Venerable! How long is the difference between the stationary and the mobile?"
"Just as the accumulation of the mobile."
"Venerable! How long is the difference between the mobile and the stationary?"
"Gautama! From the least to the end of a muhurta, and from the best to the time of the Vanaspati."
"Venerable! Are these stationary beings, some small, some large, some equal, some different?"
"Gautama! They are all the same, the stationary beings are infinite in number."
"Thus, these two types of beings are called Samsara-Samavannagha Jivas."
"They are considered to be of two types." [43]

## First Understanding: Explanation of Existence

**[113 Avasarpini's / From the field to infinite Lokas, to countless Pudgalparavart / In the countless parts of Pravalika, as many Pudgalparavart as there are times, a stationary being can remain in the stationary form.  Bante! How long can a being remain in this form?  Gautam! From the lowest to Antarmuhurt and from the highest to countless Utsarpini-Pravpinis / From the field to countless Lokas / Bhagavan! What is the difference in stationary beings?  Gautam! As much as their accumulation time is, that is, countless Utsarpini-Avasarpini times; from the field to countless Lokas / Bhagavan! What is the difference in "S"?  Gautam! From the lowest to Antarmuhurt and from the highest to the time of plants / Bhagavan! Among these "Basas" and stationary beings, who is less, more, equal or privileged?  Gautam! The "Trasas" are the least / Stationary beings are infinitely more than them. This is the description of these two types of worldly beings. This two-fold understanding, called the first understanding, is complete.  Discussion - In this sutra, the existence, body-existence, difference and less-more-ness of "Prasas" and stationary beings have been explained. The existence of stationary beings is said to be from the lowest to Antarmuhurt and from the highest to a thousand years of "Bavo". This situation should be understood by taking the earth-body, because such a high existence is not possible for other stationary bodies. The lowest existence of "Trasas" is said to be Antarmuhurt and the highest is thirty-three "Sagaropama". This should be understood in relation to Devas and Narakas / Other "Trasas" do not have such a high existence. The meaning of body-existence is the calculation of those existences when one is born again and again in the same body / For example, all the time that a stationary-bodied being is born as a stationary being, that should be understood as its body-existence. How much is the body-existence of a stationary being? This means how long does a stationary being continuously take birth as a stationary being. In answering this question, it is said that from the lowest to Antarmuhurt and from the highest to infinite time, a stationary being continues to take birth and death as a stationary being / This infinite time has been explained in relation to time and field. From the point of view of time, a stationary being can remain as a stationary being for infinite Utsarpini and Avasarpini times. From the point of view of the field, this infinity is explained as follows: in infinite Lokas, as many sky-regions as there are, if one takes away one at a time, the time it takes is infinite Avasarpini-Utsarpini time. Explaining this infinity in terms of Pudgalparavart, it is said that in countless Pudgalparavart (field Pudgalparavart), as many Utsarpini's...** 

Page #158:
---------------------------
[114] The **Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra** states that **Avapiniyas** can remain in the form of a **sthavara** for as many **Ananta Avasarpinis-Utsarpinis** as there are **Pudgalapravartas**. It is explained that one should know as many **Pudgalapravartas** as there are moments in an **Asankhyeya** part of a **Pravalika**. This duration should be understood in relation to the **Vanaspatikaaya**, not the **Prithvikaaya-Apkaaya**. Because the **Prithvikaaya Apkaaya**'s excellent **kaayasthiti** is evidence of **Asankhyeya Utsarpinis-Avasarpinis**. This is clarified in the **Prajnapanasutra**. This **Vanaspatikaayasthiti** duration should be understood in relation to **Saanvyavaharik** beings. The **kaayasthiti** of **Asaanvyavaharik** beings should be understood as **Anadi**. As stated in the **Visheshnavati** text: "There are infinite beings who have not attained **Trasattva**. Those who reside in **Nigoda** are **Anantananta**. The **kaayasthiti** of some beings with **Asanvyavahar** **rashi** is **Anadi-Ananta**, meaning they will never leave the **Asanvyavahar** **rashi** and enter the **Vyavahar** **rashi**. Some beings with **Asanvyavahar** **rashi** have a **kaayasthiti** that is **Anadi** but has an end, meaning they can enter the **Vyavahar** **rashi**. As **Jinabhadragani Kshamasraman** stated in the **Visheshnavati**: "As many beings attain **Siddha** from the **Vyavahar** **rashi**, so many beings enter the **Vyavahar** **rashi** from the **Anadi Vanaspati** **rashi**.

The question of how long a **Trasajiva** can remain in the **Sarup** form is answered: from the **Jghanya** to **Antarmuhurta**, and from the **Utkrisht** to **Asankhyeya** time. This **Asankhyeya** time is explained in terms of **Kala** and **Kshetra**. In terms of **Kala**, it is as many **Utsarpinis-Avasarpinis** as there are **Asankhyeya**. In terms of **Kshetra**, it is as many **Utsarpinis-Avasarpinis** as it takes to subtract one **Akashapradesha** from each of the **Asankhyeya** **lokas**. A **Trasajiva** can remain in the **Tras** form for that duration. This **kaayasthiti** is only possible in relation to **Gatis-Tejaskaya** and **Vayukaya**, not **Labdhitas**. The **kaayasthiti** of **Labdhitas** is only a few years more than two thousand **Sagaropama** at its peak.

After an **Antar-Sthavara** being abandons its **Sthavaratva**, how long will it take for it to become a **Sthavara** again? The answer is: **Asankhyeya Utsarpinis-Avasarpinis** in terms of **Kala**, and the difference of **Asankhyeya** **lokas** in terms of **Kshetra**. This difference is possible in relation to **Tejaskaya** and **Vayukaya**, not in relation to other **kaayas**.

After a being abandons its **Sakaya** **Sattva**, how long will it take for it to regain **Sattva**? The answer is: the difference of **Vanaspatikaala** from the **Utkrisht**. In other words, the difference is **Ananta-Ananta Utsarpinis-Avasarpinis** in terms of **Kala**, and **Ananta** **lokas** in terms of **Kshetra**.

[115 First Understanding: Exposition of the State of Existence] Clarity has been established above. This difference is possible only when entering the plant body, not otherwise. In the category of the very few, the smallest number of living beings are the Trasas, because they are innumerable. The stationary beings are infinitely greater than them, because they are infinitely numerous, surpassing even the Trasas. Thus, the exposition of the two types of worldly living beings has been described. This is the exposition of the first understanding, which is in the form of the understanding of these two types of living beings. // First Understanding Complete. 

Page #160:
---------------------------
The second understanding, known as Trividha, is discussed. In the first understanding, two types of beings who end the cycle of rebirth were explained. Now, in the second understanding, which comes in order, three types of beings who end the cycle of rebirth are to be explained. Therefore, the second understanding, called Trividha, is begun, and its initial sutra is: "There are three types of beings who end the cycle of rebirth." [44] Those who say that there are three types of beings who end the cycle of rebirth, say that there are three types of beings who end the cycle of rebirth: 1) female, 2) male, and 3) neuter. [44] (Out of the previously mentioned nine understandings)

**Explanation:** In the first understanding, two types of beings who end the cycle of rebirth, namely As and Sthavar, were described and their detailed explanation was given through 23 doors. Now, in this second understanding, it is intended to describe three types of beings who end the cycle of rebirth. It has been said that there are nine understandings regarding the beings who end the cycle of rebirth, based on differences in interpretation. All these understandings, though different in form, are non-contradictory and true. Despite the differences due to differences in interpretation, all these understandings actually present different aspects of the true reality. Those who describe the three types of beings who end the cycle of rebirth, say that there are three types of beings who end the cycle of rebirth: 1) female, 2) male, and 3) neuter.

This distinction is made based on Veda. When worldly beings are described from the perspective of Veda, they are divided into three categories. All types of worldly beings are included in these three categories from the perspective of Veda. That is, all worldly beings are either those with female Veda, male Veda, or neuter Veda. They are not without Veda. The meaning of Veda is: desire for union. Veda arises from the emergence of non-destructive, non-delusive karma. Female Veda: The karma whose emergence leads to the desire to unite with a male is called female Veda. The external sign of female Veda is the womb, breasts, etc. Women are predominantly soft, therefore, they have a greater desire for softness than for hardness. The affliction of female Veda is like the fire of cow dung (Kariṣāgni), which neither appears quickly nor subsides quickly. From a practical (gross) perspective...

## Second Chapter: Description of Women

[121] **Chandraviman-Jyotishka-Devithiyao**, **Surya-Viman-Jyotishka-Devithiyao**, **Graha-Viman-Jyotishka-Devithiyao**, **Nakshatra-Viman-Jyotishka-Devithiyao**, **Tara-Viman-Jyotishka-Devithiyao**. These are the **Jyotishka-Devithiyao**. What are the **Vimanika-Devithiyao**? **Vimanika-Devithiyao** are of two types, namely **Soudharma-Kalpa-Vimanika-Devithiyao** and **Isana-Kalpa-Vimanika-Devithiyao**. These are the **Vimanika-Devithiyao**.

[3] How many types of **Devithiyao** are there? There are four types of **Devithiyao**. Namely, 1. **Bhavana-Pati-Devithiyao**, 2. **Vana-Vyantara-Devithiyao**, 3. **Jyotishka-Devithiyao**, and 4. **Vimanika-Devithiyao**.

How many types of **Bhavana-Pati-Devithiyao** are there? **Bhavana-Pati-Devithiyao** are of ten types. Namely, **Asura-Kumar-Bhavana-Vasi-Devithiyao** up to **Stanita-Kumar-Bhavana-Vasi-Devithiyao**. This is the description of **Bhavana-Vasi-Devithiyao**.

How many types of **Vana-Vyantara-Devithiyao** are there? **Vana-Vyantara-Devithiyao** are of eight types. Namely, **Pishacha-Vana-Vyantara-Devithiyao** up to **Gandharva-Vana-Vyantara-Devithiyao**. This is the description of **Vana-Vyantara-Devithiyao**.

How many types of **Jyotishka-Devithiyao** are there? **Jyotishka-Devithiyao** are of five types. Namely, **Chandraviman-Jyotishka-Devithiyao**, **Surya-Viman-Jyotishka-Devithiyao**, **Graha-Viman-Jyotishka-Devithiyao**, **Nakshatra-Viman-Jyotishka-Devithiyao**, and **Tara-Viman-Jyotishka-Devithiyao**. This is the description of **Jyotishka-Devithiyao**.

How many types of **Vimanika-Devithiyao** are there? **Vimanika-Devithiyao** are of two types. Namely, **Soudharma-Kalpa-Vimanika-Devithiyao** and **Isana-Kalpa-Vimanika-Devithiyao**. This is the description of **Vimanika-Devithiyao**.

**Discussion:** This sutra describes women. There are no women in the **Naraka-Gati** (hell realm) because only those with **Napumsaka-Veda** (non-gendered) are in **Naraka**. Therefore, women are present in the remaining three realms - **Tiyanga**, **Manushya**, and **Deva-Gati**. Hence, the sutra states that there are three types of women - **Tiyanga-Stri**, **Manushya-Stri**, and **Deva-Stri**. In the **Tiyanga-Gati**, there are women from **Eka-Indriya** (one sense) to **Chatur-Indriya** (four senses) and **Asanjna-Panchendriya** (unconscious five senses). 

Page #166:
---------------------------
## 122] Those who are born with the [Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra] and [Sammuchhim] are eunuchs. Therefore, there are women among the [Garbha-jatiya], [Garbha-manushya], and [Devas]. Hence, three types of women have been mentioned. There are three divisions of [Tiryach] women: [Jalachari], [Thalachari], and [Khechari]. According to the sub-divisions of [Tiryach], one should know the divisions of their women. Similarly, there are [Karma-bhumika], [Akarma-bhumika], and [Antar-dvipika] divisions of human women. According to the sub-divisions of humans, one should understand the divisions of their women. For example, one should understand the 15 divisions of [Karma-bhumika] women, 30 divisions of [Akarma-bhumika] women, and 28 divisions of [Antar-dvipika] women. According to the divisions of [Bhavana-pati], [Vana-vyantar], and [Jyotishka] Devas, one should understand the divisions of their women. Among the [Vaimanika] Devas, there are women only in the first [Saudharm] Devaloka and the second [Ishan] Devaloka. There are no women in the Devalokas beyond these. Therefore, two divisions of [Vaimanika] Devis have been mentioned: [Saudharm-kalpa Vaimanika Deva-stri] and [Ishan-kalpa Vaimanika Deva-stri]. In this way, the three divisions of women have been described.

## 46] The [Bhavasthiti] of women has been explained. 
**Itthiinam bhanta! Kevaiyan kaalam thiti panatta?**
**Goayama! Egenam ayesenam jahannenam antomuhutta ukkoesenam panapannam paliovamai.**
**Ekkhenam ayesenam jahannenam antomuhutta, ukkoesenam nava paligrovamai.**
**Ekkhenam ayesenam jahannenam antomuhutta ukkoesenam satta paliovamai.**
**Ekkhenam ayesenam jahannenam antomuhutta ufkosenam pannasam paliovamai.**

**[46] O Bhagavan! How long is the [Bhavasthiti] of women said to be?**
**Gautama! From one perspective, the lowest [Bhavasthiti] is [Antarmuhurta] and the highest is [Panchapan Paliopama].**
**From another perspective, the lowest [Bhavasthiti] is [Antarmuhurta] and the highest is [Nava Paliopama].**
**From a third perspective, the lowest [Bhavasthiti] is [Antarmuhurta] and the highest is [Satta Paliopama].**
**From a fourth perspective, the lowest [Bhavasthiti] is [Antarmuhurta] and the highest is [Panchasam Paliopama].**

**Discussion:** This Sutra generally explains the [Bhavasthiti] of women. Collectively, the [Bhavasthiti] of women is explained here from four perspectives. The word "Aadesa" used in the Sutra is a word for "type". The word "prakar" is also a word for "perspective". These four "Aadesa" (types) are as follows: (1) From one perspective, the [Bhavasthiti] of women is the lowest [Antarmuhurta]. This should be understood in relation to [Tiryach] and human women. There is no such low [Bhavasthiti] elsewhere. The highest [Bhavasthiti] is [Panchapan Paliopama]. This should be understood in relation to the [Ishan-kalpa] [Aparigrihita] Devi. (2) From another perspective, the lowest [Bhavasthiti] is [Antarmuhurta] (as before) and the highest is [Nava Paliopama]. This should be understood in relation to the [Ishan-kalpa] [Parigrihita] Devi. (3) From a third perspective, the lowest [Bhavasthiti] is [Antarmuhurta] (as before) and the highest is [Satta Paliopama]. This is in relation to the [Saudharm-kalpa] [Parigrihita] Devi. 1.

## Second Discourse: The State of Devī-Strīs

**[125]** **Bhagavan!** What is the state of human women in the karmbhūmi of the Bharat and Eravata regions? **Gautama!** In terms of the region, their state is inferior to the antarmūhūrta and superior to three palyopama. In terms of the charitradharma, their state is inferior to the antarmūhūrta and superior to the desonapūrva-koṭi.

**Bhanta!** What is the state of human women in the karmbhūmi of the Pūrva-Videha and Paścima-Videha? **Gautama!** In terms of the region, their state is inferior to the antarmūhūrta and superior to the pūrva-koṭi. In terms of the charitradharma, their state is inferior to the antarmūhūrta and superior to the desonapūrva-koṭi.

**Bhanta!** What is the state of human women in the akarmabhūmi? **Gautama!** In terms of birth, their state is inferior to slightly less than one palyopama. By slightly less, it should be understood as less than an innumerable part of a palyopama. Their state is superior to three palyopama. In terms of saṃharaṇa, their state is inferior to the antarmūhūrta and superior to the desonapūrva-koṭi.

The state of human women in the Hemavat-Airayanvat region is inferior to one palyopama less than an innumerable part of a palyopama in terms of birth, and inferior to the antarmūhūrta and superior to the desonapūrva-koṭi in terms of saṃharaṇa.

**Bhanta!** What is the state of human women in the akarmabhūmi of the Harivarṣa-Ramyakavarṣa? **Gautama!** In terms of birth, their state is inferior to two palyopama less than an innumerable part of a palyopama, and superior to two palyopama. In terms of saṃharaṇa, their state is inferior to the antarmūhūrta and superior to the desonapūrva-koṭi.

**Bhanta!** What is the state of human women in the akarmabhūmi of the Devakuru-Uttarakuru? **Gautama!** In terms of birth, their state is inferior to three palyopama less than an innumerable part of a palyopama, and superior to three palyopama. In terms of saṃharaṇa, their state is inferior to the antarmūhūrta and superior to the desonapūrva-koṭi.

**Bhanta!** What is the state of human women in the akarmabhūmi of the Antaradvipas? **Gautama!** In terms of birth, their state is inferior to an innumerable part of a palyopama. Here, deson means an innumerable part of a palyopama. In other words, their inferior state is an innumerable part of a palyopama less than an innumerable part of a palyopama, and their superior state is an innumerable part of a palyopama. In terms of saṃharaṇa, their state is inferior to the antarmūhūrta and superior to the desonapūrva-koṭi.

**The State of Devī-Strīs [3]**

**Bhanta!** For how long does this state remain? **Gotama!** It remains for ten thousand years, multiplied by an innumerable number, and then it changes.

## Second Chapter: The State of Devistris

**127. The state of Chandravimaan-Jyotishkdevistris:** Their lowest state is one-fourth of a Palyopam, and their highest state is fifty thousand years more than half a Palyopam.

**The state of Suryavimaan-Jyotishkdevistris:** Their lowest state is one-fourth of a Palyopam, and their highest state is five hundred years more than half a Palyopam.

**The state of Grahavimaan-Jyotishkdevistris:** Their lowest state is one-fourth of a Palyopam, and their highest state is half a Palyopam.

**The state of Nakshatravimaan-Jyotishkdevistris:** Their lowest state is one-fourth of a Palyopam, and their highest state is slightly more than a quarter of a Palyopam.

**The state of Taravimaan-Jyotishkdevistris:** Their lowest state is one-eighth of a Palyopam, and their highest state is slightly more than one-eighth of a Palyopam.

**The state of Vaimanikdevistris:** Their lowest state is one Palyopam, and their highest state is fifty-five Palyopams.

**Bhagavan! What is the state of Vaimanikdevistris in the Saudharma Kalpa?**

**Gautam!** Their lowest state is one Palyopam, and their highest state is seven Palyopams.

**The state of Vaimanikdevistris in the Ishana Kalpa:** Their lowest state is slightly more than one Palyopam, and their highest state is nine Palyopams.

**Discussion:** This sutra explains the time duration of Tiryanchistris, Manushyastis, and Devistris in a technical and separate manner.

Firstly, the highest state of Tiryanchistris is explained. There are two types of states: lowest and highest. The lowest state means staying for the shortest duration, and the highest state means staying for the longest duration. The lowest state of Tiryanchistris is Antarmuhurt, and the highest state is three Palyopams. This highest state is in comparison to the Chatushpadastri in Devakuru, etc. In a specific context, the highest state of Jalcharastris is Purvakoti, the highest state of Sthalcharastris is Audhik (three Palyopams), and the highest state of Khecharastris is an innumerable part of a Palyopam. (The highest state of Urparisarp and Bhujparisarp is Purvakoti.) The lowest state for all is Antarmuhurt.

**The state of Manushyastis:** The state of Manushyastis is explained in two ways: one based on the region and the other based on Dharmacharan (character).

**The technical state of Manushyastis based on the region:** Their lowest state is Antarmuhurt, and their highest state is three Palyopams. This highest state is in comparison to the period of Ekant Sushma, etc., in Devakuru, etc., and in Bharat, etc.

**The state of Manushyastis based on Dharmacharan (character):** Their lowest state is Antarmuhurt, and their highest state is Deshonpurvakoti. 

Page #172:
---------------------------
The statement that the lowest state of a woman's character is a moment (antarmuhurt) is to be understood in relation to the possibility of falling from character due to a change in the stream of consequences in the same life. At least for the duration of an antarmuhurt, character remains. If a woman, due to the cessation of the karmic force (kshayopasham), accepts the character of complete renunciation (sarvavirati) and then, within at least an antarmuhurt, due to a change in the stream of consequences, falls from this character and becomes a non-renouncer (avirata) with right faith (samyagdristi) or falls into the state of false belief (mithyatvagunasthan), then, from this perspective, the lowest state of character is for the duration of an antarmuhurt. Or, even if death occurs after accepting character, the possibility of an antarmuhurt in the state of non-negligent restraint (aprammatasanyatagunasthan) is also consistent from another perspective.

Here, by practice of religion (dharmacharan), one should understand renunciation of the world (deshaviriti), not complete renunciation (sarvavirati). Renunciation of the world is also only for an antarmuhurt, even from the lowest state, because there are many types of renunciation of the world.

One might question why, even with the possibility of both types of character, only renunciation of the world is accepted. The answer is that complete renunciation is usually preceded by renunciation of the world, and this is why it is accepted. The elder teachers have said that "after attaining right faith (samyaktva), the attainment of the state of a lay follower (shravakatva) and the cessation or destruction of the karmic force that obscures character (charitramohaniya) occur after a period of time equal to a moment (palyopam) or a moment (prithaktva), which is like a number of oceans (sagaropama)."

The highest state of character is said to be the state of the first koti (deshonpurvakoti). Before the age of eight years, there are no consequences of character. After the age of eight years, if one accepts character and maintains it without falling from it until the last antarmuhurt of the first koti, then it is said to be the highest state of character. By reducing the duration of the period to eight years, the state of women is described in relation to the highest state of character. The first koti refers to one crore (one hundred million) previous lives. The measure of a previous life is as follows: one previous life is equal to 70,560,000,000,000 years (70,56000,0000000 = seventy trillion, fifty-six billion).

After describing the highest state of women, the statement is made about the special state of women in the realm of karma (karmabhumik). The state of women in the realm of karma is from the lowest state to an antarmuhurt and from the highest state to three moments (palyopam).

This should be understood in the realm of Bharat and Airāvata, in the beginning (prarak) called Sushama-Sushama. In relation to character, the lowest state is an antarmuhurt and the highest state is the first koti (deshonpurvakoti). This statement is made about the general characteristics of the realm of karma. The special statement is as follows: in Bharat and Airāvata, the state of three moments (palyopam) occurs in the realm of Sushama-Sushama. In the eastern and western Videhas, the state of one moment (palyopam) is attained in the realm, and the number of oceans (sagar) is equal to the number of steps (charanovsamakhyanam).

1. When one moment (palyopam) is attained, the lay follower (savatro) is born. The number of oceans (sagar) is equal to the number of steps (charanovsamakhyanam).

2. The measure of a previous life (puvvasa) is indeed one hundred million (kodilakhayo). One should know that there are fifty-six thousand (chhappannang cha sahasaa) previous lives (vasakodi).

---------------------------
## Second Proposition: The State of Devstriyas

[There are 129 पूर्वकोटि states, as there is no lifespan greater than this due to the nature of the realm.  Regarding the Dharma of conduct, there are states from the most inferior अन्तर्मुहूर्त to the most superior देशोनपूर्वकोटि.

_The state of अकर्मभूमिक manustriyas is described from two perspectives: one from the perspective of birth and the other from the perspective of संहरण. संहरण means to take a कर्मभूमिज woman to the अकर्मभूमि.  /  Just as someone traveling from Magadh or another country to Saurashtra, upon reaching Saurashtra and staying there, is called a resident of Saurashtra for all practical purposes, similarly, a woman taken from कर्मभूमि and संहृत in अकर्मभूमि is called a resident of कर्मभूमि.  

From the perspective of birth, the state of अकर्मभूमिज women is देशोन (an infinitesimal fraction of a पल्योपम) for the most inferior and three पल्योपम for the most superior.  /  This should be understood in relation to the realm of हैमवत and हैरण्यवत, as this is the possible range of states there. The most superior state of three पल्योपम should be understood in relation to देवकुरु and उत्तरकुरु.  /  From the perspective of संहरण, the most inferior state is अन्तर्मुहूर्त and the most superior is देशोनपूर्वकोटि.  If a woman is संहृत from कर्मभूमि to अकर्मभूमि and lives there only for an अन्तर्मुहूर्त or is संहृत back from there, then her most inferior state is called अन्तर्मुहूर्त.  /  If that woman has a lifespan of पूर्वकोटि in that realm, then her most superior state is called देशोनपूर्वकोटि.

_There might be a doubt that Bharat and Eravata realms are also in कर्मभूमि, and there too, a state of three पल्योपम exists in a solitary period, and संहरण is also possible, then how is देशोनपूर्वकोटि consistent for the most superior? The solution is that this is said from the perspective of कर्मकाल, even though it is कर्मभूमि. In Bharat and Eravata realms, in a solitary period of सुषमादि, a structure like भोगभूमि is created, therefore it is not कर्मकाल. In कर्मकाल, there is only a lifespan of पूर्वकोटि, therefore the stated देशोनपूर्वकोटि is consistent.

The state of अकर्मभूमिक manustriyas in हैमवत and हैरण्यवत is देशोन पल्योपम (an infinitesimal fraction of a पल्योपम) for the most inferior and a complete पल्योपम for the most superior from the perspective of birth.  /  From the perspective of संहरण, the most inferior state is अन्तर्मुहूर्त and the most superior is देशोनपूर्वकोटि.

The state of women in Harivarsha and Ramyakavarsha is two पल्योपम less than an infinitesimal fraction of a पल्योपम for the most inferior and a complete two पल्योपम for the most superior from the perspective of birth.  /  From the perspective of संहरण, the most inferior state is one अन्तर्मुहूर्त and the most superior is देशोनपूर्वकोटि.

In देवकुरु and उत्तरकुरु, the most inferior state is three पल्योपम less than an infinitesimal fraction of a पल्योपम and the most superior state is a complete three पल्योपम from the perspective of birth.  /  From the perspective of संहरण, the most inferior state is one अन्तर्मुहूर्त and the most superior is देशोनपूर्वकोटि.

The state of manustriyas in the Antaradvipas is an infinitesimal fraction of a पल्योपम less than a पल्योपम for the most inferior and an infinitesimal fraction of a पल्योपम for the most superior from the perspective of birth.  /  The implication is that..._

[130] The innumerable parts of the lifespan of the most excellent *palyopama* are the measure of the lifespan of the most inferior *palyopama*, and the innumerable parts of the lifespan of the most inferior *palyopama* are the measure of the lifespan of the most excellent *palyopama*. In terms of duration, the most inferior *antarmuhurt* is less than the most excellent *deshonapurvakoti*.

The lifespan of the *devastri* is from ten thousand years to fifty-five *palyopama*. This is in comparison to the *devastri* of the *bhavanapati* and *vyantar* realms. The lifespan of the *devistri* of the *ishan* realm is considered the most excellent. In particular, the lifespan of the *bhavanavasi* *devistri* is generally ten thousand years, and at its most excellent, it is four and a half *palyopama*. This is in comparison to the *asurakumari* *devistri*. Here too, in particular, the lifespan of the *asurakumari* *devistri* is generally ten thousand years, and at its most excellent, it is four and a half *palyopama*. The lifespan of the *nagakumari* *devistri* is ten thousand years at its most inferior, and *deshonpalyopama* at its most excellent. Similarly, the lifespan of the *suparnakumari* and the *stanitakumari* should be understood.

The lifespan of the *dhyantar* *devistri* is ten thousand years at its most inferior, and half a *palyopama* at its most excellent. The lifespan of the *jyotishkastri* is one-fourth of a *palyopama* at its most inferior, and fifty thousand years more than half a *palyopama* at its most excellent. In particular, the lifespan of the *chandraviman* *devistri* is one-fourth of a *palyopama* at its most inferior, and fifty thousand years more than half a *palyopama* at its most excellent. The lifespan of the *suryaaviman* *devistri* is one-fourth of a *palyopama* at its most inferior, and five hundred years more than half a *palyopama* at its most excellent. The lifespan of the *grahaaviman* *devistri* is one-fourth of a *palyopama* at its most inferior, and half a *palyopama* at its most excellent. The lifespan of the *nakshatraviman* *devistri* is one-fourth of a *palyopama* at its most inferior, and slightly more than one-fourth of a *palyopama* at its most excellent. The lifespan of the *taraviman* *devistri* is one *palyopama* at its most inferior, and slightly more than one *palyopama* at its most excellent. The lifespan of the *vaimanik* *devistri* is one *palyopama* at its most inferior, and fifty-five *palyopama* at its most excellent. In particular, the lifespan of the *soudharm* *devistri* is one *palyopama* at its most inferior, and seven *palyopama* at its most excellent. This is in comparison to the *devistri* who has been taken in. The lifespan of the *devistri* who has not been taken in is one *palyopama* at its most inferior, and fifty-five *palyopama* at its most excellent. The lifespan of the *ishan* *devistri* is slightly more than one *palyopama* at its most inferior, and nine *palyopama* at its most excellent. Here too, this is in comparison to the *devistri* who has been taken in. The lifespan of the *devistri* who has not been taken in is slightly more than one *palyopama* at its most inferior, and fifty-five *palyopama* at its most excellent. The commentator has written that in many copies, this entire text about lifespan is found, and in many copies, only this much is said: "And the lifespan of the *devistri* should be said as follows: from one *palyopama* to the *ishan* *devistri*."

## 132] . [Jivajivaabhigamsutra [The time period of a female being in the female form, before reaching the peak, is said to be 110 palyopama more than the previous koti. Its meaning is as follows: If a being is born in the form of a human female or a female of the lower realms, with the lifespan of the previous koti, and is born there five or six times, and then is born as an Aparigrihita Devi in the Ishana Kalpa, with the status of 55 palyopama, and from there, due to the decline of lifespan, is born again as a human female or a female of the lower realms, with the lifespan of the previous koti, and from there, is born again as an Aparigrihita Devi in the Ishana Devaloka, with the status of 55 palyopama, then after this, she will definitely attain the Vedantar. Thus, the time period of being born five or six times as a human female or a female of the lower realms, with the lifespan of the previous koti, and the time period of being born twice in the Ishana Devaloka, with the status of 55 palyopama, combined together, is 55+55 = 110 palyopama, which is the time period of the previous koti separation. Here, the meaning of separation is many times. After this much time, the Vedantar will definitely occur. Here, one may doubt that if a being is born in the form of a female with a lifespan of three palyopama in the Devakuru-Uttarakuru regions, then the time period of the Strived could be even longer. The solution to this doubt is that the being of a Devi, who has fallen from the Devi's state, is not born as a female in beings with an immeasurable lifespan, nor can a female with an immeasurable lifespan be born in Devis with a superior lifespan, because it is said in the Prajnapanasutra-Tika, "Jato asankhejjavasaauya ukkosiyain thiin na pavei", meaning that a female with an immeasurable lifespan does not attain the superior status. Therefore, the aforementioned evidence is the superior time period of the Strived. (2) From another perspective, the time period of the Strived is one time period at the lowest and 18 palyopama more than the previous koti at the highest. The meaning of one time period is the same as the first order. The meaning of the highest time period is as follows: A being is born in the form of a human female and a female of the lower realms for five consecutive times, and then is born twice in the Ishana Devaloka as a Devi with a superior status, and is born only in the Parigrihita Devis, not in the Aparigrihita Devis. The superior status of the Parigrihita Devis is 9 palyopama, therefore, 9+9=18 palyopama is the time period of the Ishana Devaloka. The time period of the human and lower realms, added to the previous koti separation, is 18 palyopama more than the previous koti, which is the time period of the Strived. 2 / / (3) From a third perspective, the time period of the Strived is one time period at the lowest and 14 palyopama more than the previous koti at the highest. The meaning of one time period is like the first order. The meaning of the highest is as follows: Like the second order, a being is born five or six times as a human female or a female of the lower realms, and then is born twice as a Devi in the Saudharma Devaloka, with a lifespan of 7 palyopama, in the form of a Parigrihita Devi. From this perspective, the highest time period of the Strived is 14 palyopama more than the previous koti separation. 3 /

## Second Consideration: The Duration of a Female Animal in its Form (4)

From the fourth perspective, the duration of a female animal in its form is from a minimum of one moment to a maximum of one hundred palya-upamas more than the previous koti. The concept of one moment is according to the first order. The concept of the maximum is as follows: A human female or a female animal with the previous koti lifespan, after living in the same form for five or six times, is born as an unattached goddess in the Saudharma heaven with a lifespan of fifty palya-upamas. This happens twice, resulting in 50+50 = 100 palya-upamas. Adding the time of the previous koti and the time of the female animal or human female, the total duration is one hundred palya-upamas more than the previous koti. (4)

## (5)

From the fifth perspective, the duration of a female animal in its form is from a minimum of one moment to a maximum of one palya-upamas more than the previous koti. The concept of the minimum is the same as before. The concept of the maximum is as follows: A being, after living as a human female or a female animal with the previous koti lifespan for seven births, is born in the eighth birth as a female in the form of a female among the Devakaruyaadika, who have a lifespan of three palya-upamas. From there, after death, they are born as a goddess in the Saudharma heaven, in the lowest category of goddesses (with a lifespan of one palya-upamas). After this, there is definitely a Vedantar. Thus, the duration of a female animal in its form is one palya-upamas more than the previous koti, which is the evidence.

## Conclusion

Which of these five orders is appropriate can only be determined by someone with extraordinary knowledge or someone who has attained the highest level of scriptural knowledge. Since such a situation does not exist at present, the sutrakar has mentioned all five orders without making any decision of his own. We should understand all five orders as different perspectives, considering the truth to be only knowable by the Kevali.

## Duration of a Female Animal in its Form (2)

O Bhagavan! How long can a female animal remain in the form of a female animal?

Gautama! From the minimum, it can remain for an antarmukhuta, and from the maximum, it can remain for three palya-upamas more than the previous koti.

A water creature can remain from the minimum, an antarmukhuta, to the maximum, the previous koti.

Regarding the four-legged land creatures, it is the same as the female animal.

The sky creatures, from the minimum, an antarmukhuta, to the maximum, one palya-upamas more than the previous koti, are countless. 

Page #178:
---------------------------
[134] Regarding the *Urapasarpastri* and *Bhujapasarpastri*, one should say like a water creature. The *Khechari* can remain as a *Khecharastri* for an immeasurable fraction of a *Palyopam* time, from the lowest *Antarmuhurta* to the highest *Purvakotiprithaktva*. 

**Discussion:** This sutra states the time duration for a *Tiriyachstri* to remain as a *Tiriyachstri*. A *Tiriyachstri* can remain as a *Tiriyachstri* from the lowest *Antarmuhurta* time to the highest *Purvakotiprithaktva* time, which is three *Palyopamas*. 

The meaning of this is as follows: If a *Tiriyachstri* has a lifespan of only *Antarmuhurta* and dies, attaining *Vedantar* or a unique state like a human, then the lowest state duration of *Antarmuhurta* is appropriate. 

The meaning of the highest state duration is as follows: A human and a *Tiriyach* can continuously experience eight births in the same form, but not more. Out of these, seven births have a lifespan of countable years, and the eighth birth has a lifespan of immeasurable years. 

If a sufficient human or a sufficient sentient five-sense *Tiriyach* continuously experiences seven births of sufficient humans or seven births of sufficient sentient five-sense *Tiriyach*, and is born again in the eighth birth as a sufficient human or a sufficient sentient five-sense *Tiriyach*, then according to the rule, it has an immeasurable lifespan, not a countable lifespan. 

A being with an immeasurable lifespan, upon death, is usually born in the *Devaloka*. Therefore, the ninth birth is not usually that of a human or a sentient five-sense *Tiriyach*. 

Therefore, when the previous seven births are of the highest *Purvakoti* lifespan, and the eighth birth is in *Devakuru* etc., for three *Palyopamas* at the highest, then the duration of the *Tiriyastri* is three *Palyopamas* more than *Purvakotiprithaktva*. 

In particular, a water creature female can continuously remain as a water creature female from the lowest *Antarmuhurta* to the highest *Purvakotiprithaktva*. After experiencing seven births of a water creature with a *Purvakoti* lifespan, there is definitely a change in the birth of a water creature. 

The statement regarding a four-legged land creature is similar to that of a *Tiriyachstri*. That is, from the lowest *Antarmuhurta* to the highest *Purvakotiprithaktva*, it is three *Palyopamas*. 

The statement regarding the *Urapasarpastri* and *Bhujapasarpastri* is according to the statement regarding the water creature female. That is, from the lowest *Antarmuhurta* to the highest *Purvakotiprithaktva*. 

The duration of the *Khecharastri* is an immeasurable fraction of a *Palyopam* time, from the lowest *Antarmuhurta* to the highest *Purvakotiprithaktva*. 

Thus, the duration of the *Tiriyachstri* has been stated in general and specific terms. The duration of the human female is similar.

## Second Chapter: The Duration of Human Women in the State of Tarup

**[137]** **Lord!** For how long can a Dev-stri (divine woman) remain in the form of a Dev-stri? **Gautam!** Her duration is the same as her state of being.

**Discussion:** The general duration of human women is the same as that of the general Tiryanch-stri (animal women), i.e., from the lowest, Antarmuhurt (a very short time), to the highest, Deshon Purvakoti (a very long time), plus three Palyopam (a unit of time). The meaning of this has been explained earlier in the context of Tiryanch-stri, and should be understood accordingly.

**The duration of a human woman in the Karmabhoomi (world of action) is, generally speaking, from the lowest, Antarmuhurt, to the highest, Deshon Purvakoti, plus three Palyopam, considering the Karmakshetra (field of action).** After this, her abandonment is possible. This duration is for the seven Bhav (states of existence) Mahavidehas (great non-physical realms) and the eighth Bhav, Bharat-Airavat (human and celestial realms). In the case of Ekant Sushma (a state of subtle body) and other Praraks (initial stages), one should understand the duration as three Palyopam.

**Considering Dharmacharan (righteous conduct), the lowest duration is one time, because due to the peculiarity of the destruction and pacification of Tadavaran Karma (karma that binds to the soul), there is a possibility of one time.** After death, the character is lost. **The highest duration is Deshon Purvakoti, because the complete duration of character is also Deshon Purvakoti.**

**The duration of a human woman in the Bharat-Airavat Karmabhoomi is from the lowest, Antarmuhurt, to the highest, Deshon Purvakoti, plus three Palyopam.** The explanation is as follows: A woman with the lifespan of Purvakoti (a very long time) in the Purva-Videha (eastern non-physical realm) or Pachim-Videha (western non-physical realm) is collected in the Bharat-Airavat realm during the Ekant Sushma period. Although she was born in the Mahavideha realm, she is considered to be from the Bharat-Airavat realm due to the example of the Magadh man mentioned earlier. That woman lives for Purvakoti and then, upon the exhaustion of her lifespan, is born in the Bharat-Airavat realm at the beginning of the Ekant Sushma Prarak. From this perspective, her duration is Deshon Purvakoti plus three Palyopam.

**Considering Dharmacharan, the duration should be understood as one time from the lowest and Deshon Purvakoti from the highest, similar to the Karmabhoomi woman.**

**The duration of a woman in the Purva-Videha and Pachim-Videha Karmabhoomi is from the lowest, Antarmuhurt, to the highest, Purvakoti, considering the realm.** This should be understood from the perspective of rebirth. **Considering Dharmacharan, the duration is one time from the lowest and Deshon Purvakoti from the highest.**

This is the statement about Karmabhoomi women.

**The general duration of an Akarmabhoomi (world without action) human woman is from the lowest, Deshon Palyopam, considering birth.** Ashta Bhag (eight parts) and other Pradis (initial stages) are also Deshon. Therefore, to clarify the lower limit, it is said that the countless part of Palyopam is less than one Palyopam. **The highest duration is three Palyopam.**

**Considering Sanharan (absorption), the lowest duration is Antarmuhurt.** This is from the perspective of absorption while the lifespan of Antarmuhurt remains. **The highest duration is Deshon Purvakoti plus three Palyopam.** The explanation is as follows: A human woman from the Purva-Videha or Pachim-Videha with a lifespan of Deshon Purvakoti is absorbed in the Devakuru (a celestial realm) etc. She is considered to be from the Devakuru due to the example of the Magadh man mentioned earlier. She is there in the Deshon... 

Page #182:
---------------------------
[138] A woman who has attained the *kaladharma* (natural lifespan) before the *purvakoti* (first stage of existence) and has been born with a lifespan of three *palyopamas* (units of time). In this way, the *deshon* (duration of existence) is three *palyopamas* more than the *purvakoti*. This demonstrates that the *sanharan* (destruction) of a woman with a lifespan of less than an *antarmuhurt* (short period of time) and a fetus does not occur. Otherwise, the *deshon* of the *purvakoti* cannot be proven from the *antarmuhurt* and the *purvakoti*.  

Specifically, the *deshon* of women in the *haimvat*, *airanyavat*, *harivarsha*, *ramyavarsha*, *devakuru*, *uttarakuru*, and *antarvipija* (different realms of existence) is the same as their current state, not their birth.  

The *deshon* should be understood as three *palyopamas* more than the *purvakoti* from the *antarmuhurt* in the case of *sanharan* and from the current state in the case of *utkarsha* (excellence). This concise statement should be understood clearly as follows:

* The *deshon* of a human woman in the *haimvat* and *airanyavat* is one *palyopam* less than the *palyopamasankhyeyabhag* (incalculable number of *palyopamas*) from birth and a full *palyopam* from *utkarsha*. From *sanharan*, it is one *palyopam* more than the *antarmuhurt* and the *purvakoti* from *utkarsha*.
* The *deshon* of a human woman in the *harivarsha* and *ramyavarsha* is two *palyopamas* less than the *palyopamasankhyeyabhag* from birth and two full *palyopamas* from *utkarsha*. From *sanharan*, it is two *palyopamas* more than the *antarmuhurt* and the *purvakoti* from *utkarsha*.
* The *deshon* of a human woman in the *devakuru* and *uttarakuru* is three *palyopamas* less than the *palyopamasankhyeyabhag* from birth and three full *palyopamas* from *utkarsha*. From *sanharan*, it is three *palyopamas* more than the *antarmuhurt* and the *purvakoti* from *utkarsha*.
* The *deshon* of a human woman in the *antarvipija* is an incalculable fraction of a *palyopam* less than the *palyopamasankhyeyabhag* from birth and an incalculable fraction of a *palyopam* from *utkarsha*. From *sanharan*, it is an incalculable fraction of a *palyopam* more than the *antarmuhurt* and the *purvakoti* from *utkarsha*.

The *deshon* of *devistri* (divine women) is the same as their current state. This is because they do not experience *kayasthiti* (physical existence) due to their *bhavasvabhav* (nature of existence). Divine beings do not die and become divine again.

**Interlude 46:**

"Thus, Venerable One, what is the difference in time?"

"Gotama, from the *antarmuhurt* to the *anantakal* (infinite time) is the *vanassaikalo* (time of destruction) for all *tirikkh* (non-human beings). For human beings, from the *antarmuhurt* to the *vanassaikalo* is the time for the *khettapaddutti* (destruction of the body). From the *ekkasamaya* (one moment) to the *anantakal* is the time for *dhammacharan* (practice of virtue) until the *avadpoggalpariyat* (complete liberation) is attained. This continues until the *pumvavi-deha* (previous body) and *avidehiya* (liberated being) are attained.

"Venerable One, what is the difference in time for those who have attained the *akammabhum* (state of non-action)?"

## Second Chapter: Interval of Rebirth

**[139]** **Gotama!** The interval for a woman to be reborn as a woman is from a **muhūrta** in the lowest case to **infinite time** or **the time of a plant** in the highest case.  /  The interval for a woman to be reborn as a woman after death is from a **muhūrta** in the lowest case to **infinite time** or **the time of a plant** in the highest case.  This is how the interval should be understood for all **Tiryachch-stries**.

**[49]** **Bhagavan!** How long is the interval for a woman to be reborn as a woman? (How long after a woman abandons her womanhood does she become a woman again?)

**Gotama!** The interval for a **human woman** is from a **muhūrta** in the lowest case to **infinite time** or **the time of a plant** in the highest case, depending on the **field**.  /  The interval for a **human woman** is from one **time** in the lowest case to **infinite time** or **until half the pudgala-paravartan** in the highest case, depending on **dharma-acharan**.  /  Similarly, the interval for **women in the eastern and western Videhas** should be understood in the same way.

**Bhagavan!** How long is the interval for a **woman in the Akarma-bhumi**?

**Gotama!** The interval for a **woman in the Akarma-bhumi** is from a **muhūrta** in the lowest case to **ten thousand years** in the highest case, depending on **birth**.  /  The interval for a **woman in the Akarma-bhumi** is from a **muhūrta** in the lowest case to **the time of a plant** in the highest case, depending on **death**.  This is how the interval should be understood for all **women in the Antardvipas**.  The interval for all **Deva-stries** is from a **muhūrta** in the lowest case to **the time of a plant** in the highest case.

**Discussion:** This sutra explains the interval.  /  The interval means the interruption of time.  /  The time it takes for a woman to abandon her womanhood and then regain it is called the interval for a woman.  In general, the interval for a woman is from a **muhūrta** in the lowest case to **infinite time** or **the time of a plant** in the highest case.  /  The meaning is this: If a woman dies, abandons her womanhood, and experiences the **muhūrta** of a **male** or **neuter** state, and then dies again and is reborn as a woman, then the lowest interval is the **muhūrta**.  The highest interval is **the time of a plant**.  /  **The time of a plant** is the time of countless **pudgala-paravartans**.  /  In this infinite time, countless **utsarpini** and **avasarpini** periods pass, countless **lokas** and countless **pudgala-paravartans** pass in the **field**.  The time of these **pudgala-paravartans** is a fraction of the time of the **pravalika**.  /  For such a long time, the woman's womanhood is interrupted, and then she regains it.  Similarly, the interval for **Tiryachch-stries**, **aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial women**, and **human women** should be understood.

**1.** "**Infinite utsarpini and avasarpini time, infinite lokas in the field, countless pudgala-paravartans**" - this is the **time of a plant**. 

Page #184:
---------------------------
[140] One should know that the difference between human beings in the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi) and women in the realm of karma, in terms of their lifespan, is from a very short time (antar-muhurt) to an infinite time (vanaspati-kal), which is the time taken for a plant to grow. In terms of religious practice, the difference is from a short time to an infinite time, which is the time taken for the complete transformation of the pudgala (deshona aparrdh pudgal paravart). There is no longer a time for the attainment of liberation (charan-labdhi). The time for the attainment of liberation (darshan-labdhi) is prohibited in all places where the complete transformation of the pudgala has taken place. Similarly, one should understand the difference between human beings and women in the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi) and the women of the eastern and western Videha (purva videha paschim videha) in terms of their lifespan and religious practice. The difference between human beings in the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi) and women in the realm of karma, in terms of their birth, is from a very short time (antar-muhurt) to ten thousand years. The explanation is as follows: A woman in the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi) dies and is reborn in the realm of the lower gods (devas). After living for ten thousand years, she dies and is reborn in the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi) as a man or a woman (because no one is born directly in the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi) from the realm of the gods (devas)). She dies after a very short time (antar-muhurt) and is reborn as a woman in the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi). This is the difference between a very short time (antar-muhurt) and ten thousand years. The difference in terms of their lifespan is the time taken for a plant to grow (vanaspati-kal). The difference between a very short time (antar-muhurt) and the time taken for a plant to grow (vanaspati-kal) in terms of their death is as follows: A woman in the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi) is taken to the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi) and after a very short time (antar-muhurt), her mind is changed and she is placed back in the same place. The difference in terms of their lifespan is the time taken for a plant to grow (vanaspati-kal). In such a long time, death also occurs in the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi) just like birth. A woman in the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi) is taken to the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi). After her lifespan is over, she wanders for an infinite time in the form of plants, etc., and is reborn in the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi). If someone takes her to the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi) from there, then this is the time taken for death (sanharan). Similarly, one should say that the difference between human beings and women in the realm of karma (Karm-bhoomi) and the women of the Himavat, Hairanyavat, Hari-varsha, Ramya-varsha, Deva-kuru, Uttara-kuru, and the inner islands (antar-vipas) in terms of their birth and death is from a very short time (antar-muhurt) to an infinite time (vanaspati-kal). The difference between the women of the gods (devas) is from a very short time (antar-muhurt) to the time taken for a plant to grow (vanaspati-kal). A woman who has fallen from the state of a goddess (devi) is born as a human being. After she has fulfilled her lifespan and died due to various causes, she is reborn as a goddess (devi). This is the difference between a very short time (antar-muhurt) and the time taken for a plant to grow (vanaspati-kal). Similarly, one should know that the difference between the women of the Asura-kumaras, the goddesses, and the women of the Ishana-kalpa is from a very short time (antar-muhurt) to the time taken for a plant to grow (vanaspati-kal).  Alpabahutva 50. (1) "Etaasi nam bhanta! Tirik-khajonitthiyaanam, manussisthiyaanam devitthiyaanam kayara kayaraahito appaa vaa bahuya vaa tullaa vaa visesaahyaa vaa? Goayama! Savvathovaa manussisthiao, tirik-khajoniaao asankhejjaguanao, devitthiyaao asankhijjaguanao."

## Second Understanding: Scarcity [143]

**Scarcity** is explained in five ways in this sutra.

**(1)** **General Scarcity:**  Human women are the least numerous, with their number being a mere koti-koti (a specific large number).  Animal women are countless times more numerous, as each island and ocean teems with them, and islands and oceans are countless.  Divine women are countless times more numerous than animal women, as the Bhavanavasi, Vyantara, Jyotishka, and Saudharma-Ishana goddesses each occupy countless regions of space. This is the first type of scarcity.

**(2)** **Scarcity among Animal Women:**  The least numerous are the flying animal women.  Land-dwelling animal women are countless times more numerous, as they are naturally more abundant than flying animals.  Water-dwelling animal women are countless times more numerous, as the salt ocean, the Kalod ocean, and the Swayambhuraman ocean are teeming with fish, and the Swayambhuraman ocean is vast beyond all other islands and oceans.

**(3)** **Scarcity among Human Women:**  The least numerous are the human women of the Akarmabhoomi in the inner islands, as the region is small.  The women of Devakuru and Uttar Kuru are countless times more numerous, as the region is countless times larger.  The women of both regions are equal in number, as their regions are of equal size.  The women of the Harivarsha and Ramyakavarsha Akarmabhoomi are countless times more numerous, as the region is much larger than Devakuru and Uttar Kuru.  The women of both regions are equal in number, as their regions are of equal size.  The women of the Haimavat and Hairanyavat Akarmabhoomi are countless times more numerous, as their abundance is due to their low status, even though the region is small.  The women of both regions are equal in number, as their regions are of equal size.  The women of the Bharat and Airavat Karmabhoomi are equal in number... 

Page #188:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**[144]** The number of *jiva* in the *jiva-jiva-migama-sutra* is innumerable, because they are naturally abundant due to being the *karma-bhoomi*. They are equal to each other in their respective locations, because both regions have the same structure. The number of human females in the *karma-bhoomi* of *purva-videha* and *paschima-videha* is innumerable, because they are naturally abundant there due to the abundance of the region, similar to the time of *Ajitanatha* Tirthankara. They are equal to each other in their respective locations, because they have the same regional structure.

**(4)** The fourth *alpa-bahutva* relates to four types of goddesses. The least numerous are the *vaimanika* goddesses, because the number of *pradesh* in the *dhani-krita* *loka* is equal to the square root of the number of *pradesh* in an angul-maatra region multiplied by its cube root, minus one thirty-second of the total number of *pradesh* in the *dhani-krita* *loka*. The number of *sau-dharma* *deva-loka* goddesses is equal to this number, and the number of *ishana* *deva-loka* goddesses is also equal to this number. The number of *bhavana-vaasi* goddesses is innumerable times greater than the number of *vaimanika* goddesses, because the number of *bhavana-vaasi* goddesses is equal to the square root of the number of *pradesh* in an angul-maatra region multiplied by its square root, minus one thirty-second of the total number of *pradesh* in the region. The number of *vyantara* goddesses is innumerable times greater than the number of *bhavana-vaasi* goddesses, because the number of *vyantara* goddesses is equal to the number of *khanda* in a *pradesh* of *san-khyeya* *yojana* in a *pradesh* of one *pradesh* *shreni*, minus one thirty-second of the total number of *khanda*. The number of *jyotishka* goddesses is innumerable times greater than the number of *vyantara* goddesses, because the number of *jyotishka* goddesses is equal to the number of *pradesh* in a *pradesh* of 256 *angul*, minus one thirty-second of the total number of *pradesh*.

**(5)** The fifth *alpa-bahutva* relates to all female beings. The least numerous are the human females of the *antar-vipa* *karma-bhoomi*. The human females of *deva-kuru* and *uttar-kuru* are innumerable times greater than them. The human females of *hari-varsha* and *ramya-varsha* are innumerable times greater than them. The human females of *hemavat* and *hairanya-vat* are innumerable times greater than them. The human females of *bharat* and *eravat* *karma-bhoomi* are innumerable times greater than them. The human females of *purva-videha* and *paschima-videha* are innumerable times greater than them. Their explanation should be understood as before. The number of *vaimanika* goddesses is innumerable times greater than the number of human females of *purva-videha* and *paschima-videha*, because they are equal to the number of *akash-pradesh* in innumerable *shreni*. The number of *bhavana-vaasi* goddesses is innumerable times greater than them, as explained before. The number of *khechara* goddesses is innumerable times greater than them. They are equal to the number of *akash-pradesh* in innumerable *shreni* in innumerable parts of a *pradesh*. The number of *sthala-chara* goddesses is innumerable times greater than them, because they are equal to the number of *akash-pradesh* in innumerable *shreni* in the innumerable part of a large *pradesh*. The number of *jala-chara* *tiyancha* goddesses is innumerable times greater than them, because they are equal to the number of *akash-pradesh* in innumerable *shreni* in the innumerable part of the largest *pradesh*. The number of *vyantara* goddesses is innumerable times greater than them, because the number of *vyantara* goddesses is equal to the number of *khanda* in a *pradesh* of *koti-koti* *yojana* in a *pradesh* of one *shreni*, minus one thirty-second of the total number of *khanda*. The number of *jyotishka* goddesses is innumerable times greater than the number of *vyantara* goddesses, as explained before. The number of females...

## Second Chapter: The State of Striveda [145]

**The State of Striveda** [51]

"O Lord! How long is the bondage state of Striveda karma?"

"Gautama! The lowest state of Striveda is less than an innumerable part of a Palya by the seventh part of one and a half Sagara. The highest state of Striveda is fifteen Kodakodi Sagara. The period of non-obstruction is fifteen hundred years. The state of karma that is devoid of the period of non-obstruction is the one that is experienced, and therefore it is the Karma-nisheka (the creation of karma-dalis)."

"O Lord! How is Striveda described?"

"Gautama! Striveda is like the fire of Fufu (the fire of the forest)."

Thus, the rights of women are fulfilled. The experience of the Striveda karma arises from the experience of the Striveda karma. Therefore, the proof of the lowest and highest states of Striveda karma is presented in this sutra.

Gautama Swami asked, "O Lord! How long is the bondage state of Striveda?"

In response, the Lord said, "The lowest bondage state of Striveda is less than an innumerable part of a Palya by the seventh part of one and a half Sagara."

The method of bringing about the lowest state is as follows: In the highest state of bondage of a particular nature, the amount obtained by dividing the highest state of Mithyatva by seventy Kodakodi Sagara, and then subtracting an innumerable part of a Palya from it, is the lowest state of that nature.

The highest state of Striveda is fifteen Kodakodi Sagara. When we divide it by seventy Kodakodi Sagara, we get twenty-four Kodakodi Sagara. According to the principle of Chhedya-Chhedaka, dividing this amount by ten gives us "Kodakodi Sagara" as the state. Subtracting an innumerable part of a Palya from this gives us the aforementioned state.

This explanation is according to the original commentary. According to the Panchasangraha, the magnitude of the lowest state is the same, only it should not be said that it is less than an innumerable part of a Palya.

The Karma-prakriti Sangrahani-kara has described another method of bringing about the lowest state.

"From the statement, 'The amount obtained by the highest state of Mithyatva is less than an innumerable part of a Palya' - Karma-prakriti Sangraha.

"The amount obtained by the highest state of Mithyatva is less than an innumerable part of a Palya."

"The remainder is less than an innumerable part of a Palya." - Karma-prakriti Sangraha. 

Page #190:
---------------------------
[146] The natures of karmas like Jobajovaabhigamsutra are called categories like Gyaanavaranee etc. The highest state of a category is the highest state of Mithyaatva, and by dividing it by the number of Palyopama, the lowest state is obtained. Here, the nature of the category of Strived, Nokashaayamoha is twenty Kodakodi Sagaropama. By dividing it by seventy Kodakodi Sagaropama (by dividing zero by zero), the state of Kodakodi Sagaropama is formed. That is, the seventh part of two Kodakodi Sagaropama, by subtracting the number of Palyopama from it, the lowest state of Strived is obtained in this way, Kodakodi Sagaropama with a number of Palyopama less. The highest state of Strived is fifteen Kodakodi Sagaropama. There are two types of states - Karma Rupa Avasthan Rupa and Anubhav Yogya. The state mentioned here is Karma Rupa Avasthan Rupa. The Anubhav Yogya state is less than the Aabaadha Kaal. The karma that has the highest state of Kodakodi Sagaropama, its Aabaadha Kaal is one hundred years. For example, the highest state of Strived is fifteen Kodakodi Sagaropama, so its Aabaadha Kaal is fifteen hundred years. That is, for so long, the bound nature does not rise and does not give its fruit. After the Aabaadha Kaal is over, the Karma Dalikas are created, that is, that nature rises. This is called Karma Nishaek. The Karma state that is less than the Aabaadha Kaal is Anubhav Yogya. After the bound state of Strived, Gautam Swami asked the type of Strived. In response, Bhagwan said that Strived is like the fire of Fumphuk (Kaarish-Chhane), that is, it awakens slowly and remains for a long time. Thus, the authority regarding women ends. The exposition regarding men is from 52. 

Se ki tan purisa? Purisa ti viha panatta, tan jaha - tirikhjooniy purisa, manuss purisa, dev purisa. Se ki tan tirikhjooniy purisa? Tirikhjooniy purisa ti biha panatta, tan jaha - jalayara, thalayara, khahayara. Ithi bhedo bhaaniyavvo jaav khahayara. Se tan khahayara, se tan khahayara tirikhjooniy purisa. Se kin tan manuss purisa? Manuss purisa ti viha panatta, tan jaha - kamma bhumga, akamma bhumga, antar diivga. Se tan manuss purisa. Se ki tan dev purisa? Dev purisa chaubbiha panatta, ityobhedo bhaaniyavyo jaav sadhvatu sidha.

## Second Chapter: Time Duration [147 [52]

**What are men and how many types are there?** There are three types of men: *tiryakyonik* men, human men, and divine men.

**How many types of *tiryakyonik* men are there?** There are three types of *tiryakyonik* men: aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial.

**Just as the distinctions in the rights of women have been mentioned, so should it be mentioned up to the aerial beings.** This is the description of the aerial beings and, along with them, the *tiryakyonik* aerial men.

**O Lord! How many types of human men are there?** Gautam! There are three types of human men: *karmabhumik*, *akarmabhumik*, and *antarvipik*. These are the distinctions among humans.

**How many types of divine men are there?** There are four types of divine men. Just as the distinctions mentioned in the rights of women should be mentioned, so should the distinctions of divine men be mentioned up to the *sarvarthasiiddha*.

**Discussion:** The distinctions mentioned in the rights of women should be mentioned in the distinctions of men. The special feature is only in the divine men. There are four types of divine men: *bhavanpati*, *vanavyantar*, *jyotishk*, and *vaimanik*.

**The *bhavanpati* has 10 distinctions, such as *asurakumar*. The *vanavyantar* has distinctions such as *pisaach*. The *jyotishk* has five distinctions, such as *chandra*. The *vaimanik* gods are of two types: *kalopappan* and *kalpaatit*.**

**The twelve divine realms, such as *soudharma*, are *kalopappan*. The *graiveyak* and *anuttaropapati* gods are *kalpaatit*.**

**The *anuttaropapati* has five distinctions: *vijay*, *vaijayant*, *jayant*, *aparaajit*, and *sarvarthasiiddha*.**

**Therefore, it is said, "Jaa samvatthasiiddha".**

## Time Duration 53

**O Lord! What is the time duration of a man?** Gautam! The lowest is an *antarmuhurt* and the highest is thirty-three *sagaropama*.

**The time duration of *tiryakyonik* men and human men should be known to be the same as that of *tiryakyonik* women and human women. The time duration of divine men, up to the *sarvarthasiiddha* gods of the *vaimanik* realm, should be known to be the same as that mentioned in the *prajnaapana* in the section on time duration.**

**Discussion:** When asked about the time duration of men without leaving their own existence, the Lord said that the lowest is an *antarmuhurt* and the highest is thirty-three *sagaropama*. The lowest time duration is mentioned as an *antarmuhurt* because of the possibility of death within an *antarmuhurt*. The highest time duration is mentioned as thirty-three *sagaropama* because of the *anuttaropapati* gods. 

Page #192:
---------------------------
[148] The state of the **tiryanch** male beings, the aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial male beings, is the same as that of the **tiryanch** female beings mentioned earlier. The state of the **paudhik** and **karmabhoomi-akarmabhoomi-antarvipa** human male beings should be understood in the same way as that of the women in their respective categories, both in general and in particular. For clarity, the details are as follows:

The state of the **tiryanch** male beings is from the lowest **antarmuhurt** to the highest **three palyopama** for the **niyanch** male beings. For the aquatic male beings, it is from the lowest **antarmuhurt** to the highest **purvakoti**. For the quadruped terrestrial male beings, it is from the lowest **antarmuhurt** to the highest **three palyopama**. For the **urparisarp** terrestrial male beings, it is from the lowest **antarmuhurt** to the highest **purvakoti**. For the **bhujparisarp** terrestrial male beings and the aerial male beings, it is from the lowest **antarmuhurt** to the highest **an uncountable part of palyopama**.

The state of the human male beings is from the lowest **antarmuhurt** to the highest **three palyopama** for the **paudhik** human male beings. In terms of religious practice, the lowest is **antarmuhurt** and the highest is **deshon purvakoti**. The lowest **antarmuhurt** state is in relation to the external **linga** and the acceptance of **pravrajya**. Otherwise, even a **samayik** (temporary) **charanparinam** (change of state) is possible. Alternatively, due to the complete breaking of **deshivirati** (abstinence from worldly desires), the lowest **antarmuhurt** is possible. After the age of eight years, the state of **purvakoti** is considered higher than that of someone who has attained **charan-pratipatti** (acceptance of the path) before the age of **purvakoti**.

The state of the **karmabhoomi** human beings is from the lowest **antarmuhurt** to the highest **three palyopama**. In terms of **charitradharma** (moral conduct), their state is from the lowest **antarmuhurt** to the highest **deshon purvakoti**. The lowest state of the **bharat** and **airavat** **karmabhoomi** human male beings is **antarmuhurt** in relation to the **kshetra** (region) and the highest is **three palyopama**. This is in relation to the **sushama-sushama** (favorable-unfavorable) time. In terms of **charitradharma**, the lowest state is **antarmuhurt** and the highest is **deshon purvakoti**. The lowest state of the **purvavideh** and **paschimavideh** male beings is **antarmuhurt** in relation to the **kshetra** and the highest is **deshon purvakoti**. In terms of **charandharma** (religious practice), the lowest is **antarmuhurt** and the highest is **deshon purvakoti**.

The state of the **akarmabhoomi** human male beings is generally from the lowest **a part of palyopama less than an uncountable part of palyopama** to the highest **three palyopama** in relation to birth. In terms of **sanharan** (destruction of karma), the lowest is **antarmuhurt** and the highest is **deshon purvakoti**. The state of the **haimavat** and **airanyavat** human male beings is from the lowest **a part of palyopama less than an uncountable part of palyopama** to the highest **a full palyopama** in relation to birth. In terms of **sanharan**, the lowest is **antarmuhurt** and the highest is **deshon purvakoti**. The state of the **harivarsha** and **ramyakavarsha** human male beings is from the lowest **two parts of palyopama less than an uncountable part of palyopama** to the highest...

The time for a *purusha* to remain in the form of a *purusha* is 54. *Purisa*! *Bhanta*! How long is the time for a *purisa*? *Go-yama*! For a *tirikkajoniya purisa*, the time is as long as the *antomuhatta* multiplied by the *ukkose* and the *sagaropama* multiplied by the *sayapuhutta* and *satirega*. *Tirikkajoniya purisa*! *Bhanta*! How long is the time for a *tirikkajoniya purisa*? *Go-yama*! For a *tirikkajoniya purisa*, the time is as long as the *antomuhatta* multiplied by the *ukkose* and three *palinovama* multiplied by the *puvakoddiputtamabhiyaai*. This is the same for the accumulation of a *tirikkajoniya purisa* as it is for the accumulation of a *khahayara tirikkajoniya purisa*.

## Second Understanding: The Duration of a Man Remaining in the Form of a Man

**[151]** **O Bhagavan!** For how long can a man remain continuously in the form of a man? **Gautama:** From the least, an antarmukhurta, to the most, a time exceeding three palyopama by a shatapruthaktva (two hundred to nine hundred sagaropama). **O Bhagavan!** For how long can a man of the animal realm remain continuously in that form? **Gautama:** From the least, an antarmukhurta, to the most, a time exceeding three palyopama by a purvakotiprthaktva. **[54]**  

**O Bhagavan!** For how long can a man remain continuously in the form of a man? **Gautama:** From the least, an antarmukhurta, to the most, a time exceeding three palyopama by a shatapruthaktva (two hundred to nine hundred sagaropama). **O Bhagavan!** For how long can a man of the animal realm remain continuously in that form? **Gautama:** From the least, an antarmukhurta, to the most, a time exceeding three palyopama by a purvakotiprthaktva. 

Thus, the duration of a man remaining in the form of a man is the same as the duration of a woman remaining in the form of a woman, and so on, up to the duration of a man of the animal realm. The duration of a man of the akarmabhumi is the same as the duration of a woman of the akarmabhumi. Similarly, the duration of a man of the antaradvipa is the same as the duration of a man of the akarmabhumi. The duration of a deva is the same as the duration of a deva of the sarvarthasiddha. 

**Discussion:** For how long can a man remain continuously in the form of a man without abandoning the man-form? In response to this question, Bhagavan said that from the least, an antarmukhurta, to the most, a time exceeding two hundred to nine hundred sagaropama. A man who dies after an antarmukhurta and is reborn as a woman, etc., is considered to have lived for an antarmukhurta. Generally, in the realms of the animal, human, and deva, a man can remain in the form of a man for this duration. This duration should be understood as slightly more than the duration of a human realm. A man cannot remain continuously in the form of a man for a longer duration than this. He will inevitably be reborn as a woman, etc. The same applies to men of the animal realm as it does to women of the animal realm.

## 152 [Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra]

**Tiryak-Yoni (lower animal realm) males can remain in their male form continuously from the lowest (Jghanya) to the Antarmuhurta (a very short time) without abandoning their masculinity. After death, they attain a different state of existence (Gatyantar) or a different state of knowledge (Vedantar).**

**From the highest (Utkarhsa) to the Pre-Koți-Pruthaktva (a very long time), they can remain for a maximum of three Pal-Yopamas (a very long time).**

**Seven of these existences are in the Pre-Koți lifespan, including the Videha (liberated) state, and the eighth existence is in the Deva-Kuru and Uttara-Kuru realms, where the lifespan is three Pal-Yopamas.**

**In this way, they can remain in the same form for a period of time equal to a Pal-Yopamas and Pre-Koți-Pruthaktva (many Pre-Koți).**

**From the lowest (Jghanya) to the Pre-Koți-Pruthaktva, the Jal-Char-Parusha (aquatic animal) male should be understood as being reborn repeatedly, two, three, or four times.**

**From the lowest (Jghanya) to the Antarmuhurta, and from the highest (Utkarhsa) to the Pre-Koți-Pruthaktva, the Chatush-Pad-Sthal-Char (quadruped) male should be understood in the same way as the previously mentioned Tiryak male.**

**From the lowest (Jghanya) to the Antarmuhurta, and from the highest (Utkarhsa) to the Pre-Koți-Pruthaktva, the Ur-Parisarp (snake) and Bhuj-Parisarp (lizard) Sthal-Char males should be understood in the same way as the previously mentioned Jal-Char male.**

**From the lowest (Jghanya) to the Antarmuhurta, and from the highest (Utkarhsa) to the Pre-Koți-Pruthaktva, the Khechar (flying animal) male should be understood as being reborn for a period of time equal to an innumerable fraction of a Pal-Yopamas.**

**Seven of these existences are in the Pre-Koți lifespan, and the eighth existence is in the Antar-Vipadi (intermediate) Khechar male (those who exist for an innumerable fraction of a Pal-Yopamas).**

**The duration of the continuous existence of human males in their form is according to the previously mentioned duration of human females (Vaktanyata).**

**It is as follows: The duration of the continuous existence of a human male in his form, from the lowest (Jghanya) to the Antarmuhurta, and from the highest (Utkarhsa) to the Pre-Koți-Pruthaktva, is a maximum of three Pal-Yopamas.**

**Seven of these existences are in the Maha-Videha (great liberated) state, with a Pre-Koți lifespan, and the eighth existence is in the Deva-Kuru and other realms, with a lifespan of three Pal-Yopamas.**

**In terms of Dharma-Charan (religious practice), the lowest is one time, and the highest is Deshon (a very long time) Pre-Koți.**

**After a lifespan of one year, Charitra-Pratipatti (character development) occurs. Therefore, Deshon is said to be eight years less.**

**In a specific context, the human male in the Karma-Bhoomi (realm of action) can remain continuously in his form from the lowest (Jghanya) to the Antarmuhurta, and from the highest (Utkarhsa) to the Pre-Koți-Pruthaktva, for a maximum of three Pal-Yopamas.**

**This should be understood as being reborn seven times in the Pre-Koți lifespan, and the eighth time in the Bharat-Airavat (human realm) in the Ekant-Sushma-Pare (state of pure consciousness) with a lifespan of three Pal-Yopamas.**

**In terms of Dharma-Charan (religious practice), the lowest is one time (the result of Sarva-Virati (complete renunciation) can also be one time), and the highest is Deshon Pre-Koți.**

**The total duration of Charitra (character) is also the same.**

**The human male in the Bharat-Airavat Karma-Bhoomi can also remain continuously in his form from the lowest (Jghanya) to the Antarmuhurta, and from the highest (Utkarhsa) to the Deshon Pre-Koți, for a maximum of three Pal-Yopamas.**

**This should be understood as being reborn in the Bharat-Airavat realm after being brought from the Videha realm with a Pre-Koți lifespan, and being designated as a Bharat-Kshetriya (belonging to the Bharat realm). This is because the lifespan of the existence is reduced, and the human male is born at the beginning of the Ekant-Sushma-Kal (state of pure consciousness).**

**In terms of Dharma-Charan (religious practice), the lowest is one time, and the highest is Deshon Pre-Koți.**

**This is the summary (Sanchittana).**

## Second Chapter: Inter-Door [153]

**[East and West Videha Karmabhoomi]** A human being in the East and West Videha Karmabhoomi can remain in the same form for a period ranging from a mere Antarmuhurt (a very short time) to a period as long as the Purvakoti (a very long time), depending on their karmic merit. They should understand this in relation to the seven births they experience in this realm. After that, there is a definite change in their motion and womb. 

**[Karmabhoomi]** A human being in the Karmabhoomi can remain in the same form for a period ranging from a mere Palyopama (a very long time) to a period as long as three Palyopama, depending on their karmic merit. 

**[Death]** The shortest time a human being in the Karmabhoomi can remain in the same form before death is an Antarmuhurt (this Antarmuhurt is in relation to the remaining lifespan in the Karmabhoomi). The longest time they can remain in the same form before death is a period as long as three Palyopama, which is longer than the Purvakoti (this Purvakoti is in relation to the lifespan of a human being who dies in Uttar Kuru and is reborn there). 

**[Gestation]** The Purvakoti is in relation to the gestation period. The death of a fetus is prohibited.

**[Hemvat and Hairanyavat Karmabhoomi]** A human being in the Hemvat and Hairanyavat Karmabhoomi can remain in the same form for a period ranging from a mere Palyopama to a period as long as a full Palyopama, depending on their karmic merit. The shortest time they can remain in the same form before death is an Antarmuhurt. The longest time they can remain in the same form before death is a period as long as one Palyopama, which is longer than the Purvakoti.

**[Harivarsha and Ramyakavarsha Karmabhoomi]** A human being in the Harivarsha and Ramyakavarsha Karmabhoomi can remain in the same form for a period ranging from two Palyopama to a period as long as two full Palyopama, depending on their karmic merit. The shortest time they can remain in the same form before death is an Antarmuhurt (because a human being with a lifespan shorter than an Antarmuhurt cannot die). The longest time they can remain in the same form before death is a period as long as two Palyopama, which is longer than the Purvakoti.

**[Devakuru and Uttar Kuru Karmabhoomi]** A human being in the Devakuru and Uttar Kuru Karmabhoomi can remain in the same form for a period ranging from three Palyopama to a period as long as three full Palyopama, depending on their karmic merit. The shortest time they can remain in the same form before death is an Antarmuhurt. The longest time they can remain in the same form before death is a period as long as three Palyopama, which is longer than the Purvakoti.

**[Antarvipak]** A human being in the Antarvipak can remain in the same form for a period ranging from an innumerable part of a Palyopama to a period as long as an innumerable part of a full Palyopama, depending on their karmic merit. The shortest time they can remain in the same form before death is an Antarmuhurt. The longest time they can remain in the same form before death is a period as long as an innumerable part of a Palyopama, which is longer than the Purvakoti.

**[Devapurusha]** The state of the Devapurusha, as described earlier, is also their Sanchiththana (physical state). One might question how the Sanchiththana can be in one single birth when it is in relation to many births and states. This is not a fault, as the intention here is only to explain how long a Devapurusha can remain in the state of Devapurushatva without leaving it. A Devapurusha does not become a Devapurusha in the next birth after death. Therefore, it is an exaggeration to say that the state of the Devapurusha is also their Sanchiththana.

**Inter-Door 55.** **[Question]** "Sir, how long is the interval?" **[Answer]** "Just as a single moment is the time for the rising of the sun, so is the interval." 

Page #198:
---------------------------
[154] The interval for the Tiryanchoniya Purusha, from the lowest to the highest, is from Antomuhurta to Vanaspatikala. This is the same for the Khacharya Tiryanchoniya Purusha.  Bhagavan! What is the interval for the Manusya Purusha?  Gautama! From the lowest, it is Antomuhurta, and from the highest, it is Vanaspatikala, in relation to the Kshetra.  From the lowest, it is one Samaya, and from the highest, it is Ananta Kala, which includes countless Utsarpini and Avasarpini periods, until the time of the Desurna, the half-Pudgala Parivarta.  /  The interval for the Karmabhumiga, up to the Videha, is the same as for the Manusya, from the lowest, it is one Samaya, and from the highest, it is the same as for the Dharmachara.  The interval for the Antardeepga, up to the Devapurusha, is the same as for the Dharmachara.  The interval for the Devapurusha, from the lowest to the highest, is from Antomuhurta to Vanaspatikala.  /  This is the same for the Bhavanavasi Devapurusha, up to the Sahasrar Devlok.  Bhagavan! What is the interval for the Anat Devapurusha?  Gautama! From the lowest, it is Vasapuhutta, and from the highest, it is Vanaspatikala.  This is the same for the Gevejja Devapurusha.  The interval for the Anuttarovawaiya Devapurusha, from the lowest to the highest, is from Vasapuhutta to Sankhejjai, which is equal to the Sagarovamai, the Sairigai. [55] 

Page #199:
---------------------------
## Second Principle: Interval

**[155]** In the same way, one should know the interval of the **Graveyaka** celestial beings. The interval of the **Anuttaropapatik** celestial beings is slightly more than the interval of the **Jghanya** (lowest) celestial beings, which is a year, and the interval of the **Utkrushta** (highest) celestial beings is like an ocean. In the previous sutra, the time spent in the same **Paryaya** (state) was explained. This sutra explains the time taken by a soul to regain its current **Paryaya** after leaving it. This is called the **Antara** (interval).

Here, the **Antara** of the **Tiryanch** (animals), **Manushya** (humans), and **Devapurush** (celestial beings) is being discussed. Generally, after leaving the **Purusha** (male) **Paryaya**, how long does it take for a soul to regain the **Purusha** **Paryaya**? When asked this question by **Gautama Swami**, the Lord said, "**Gautama**, the **Antara** of the **Jghanya** is one **Samaya** (moment) and the **Antara** of the **Utkrushta** is **Vanaspatikala** (the time taken for a plant to grow)."

This is explained as follows: When a man ascends to the **Upshama** (subdued) category and subdues the **Purusha** **Veda** (knowledge), he dies after one **Samaya** and is reborn as a **Devapurush** according to the law. Therefore, the **Antara** is said to be one **Samaya**. Some may question why the **Antara** of a woman or a eunuch who also ascends the categories is not one **Samaya**. The answer is that after subduing the **Veda**, a woman or a eunuch who dies with good **Adhyavasaya** (determination) is reborn as a **Devapurush** according to the law, not as a **Dev** (female celestial being) or a eunuch. Therefore, their **Antara** is not one **Samaya**.

The **Antara** of the **Utkrushta** **Purusha** is called **Vanaspatikala**. Explaining **Vanaspatikala**, it is said, "Countless **Utsappini** (ascending) and **Avasappini** (descending) cycles pass in it, countless **Loka** (worlds) are destroyed, and countless **Pudgalparavarta** (changes in matter) occur. These **Pudgalparavarta** are equal to countless parts of the time of the **Pravalika** (a specific time period)."

After explaining the **Antara** of a general **Purusha**, the **Antara** of **Tiryanch** (animals) and other specific categories is explained. The **Antara** of **Tiryanch** is **Antarmuhurta** (a very short time) for the **Jghanya** and **Vanaspatikala** for the **Utkrushta**. The **Antara** of **Tiryanch** women is the same as the **Antara** of **Tiryanch** men. The **Antara** of **Jalchar** (aquatic animals), **Sthalchar** (terrestrial animals), and **Khechar** (aerial animals) is also **Antarmuhurta** for the **Jghanya** and **Vanaspatikala** for the **Utkrushta**. The **Antara** of **Manushya** (human) women is the same as the **Antara** of **Manushya** men.

Therefore, generally, the **Antara** of a **Manushya** **Purusha** is **Antarmuhurta** for the **Jghanya** and **Vanaspatikala** for the **Utkrushta** in terms of **Kshetra** (region). In terms of **Dharmacharan** (religious practice), the **Antara** is one **Samaya** for the **Jghanya** (because after accepting **Charitra** (conduct), one can fall back and regain **Charitra** in one **Samaya**), and **Deshon Aparth Pudgalparavarta** (half the time of a **Pudgalparavarta**) for the **Utkrushta**.

1. "**Pranatao Ussappini Gro Prosappini Pro Kalo, Khettayyo Ananta Loga, Asankhejjja Poggalpariyatta, Te Nan Puggalpariyatta Pravaliyae Asankhejjai Bhago.**" (This is the time for **Utsappini** and **Avasappini** cycles, countless **Loka** are destroyed, countless **Pudgalparavarta** occur, and these **Pudgalparavarta** are equal to countless parts of the time of the **Pravalika**.)

## Translation:

[156] In the same way, regarding the birth and character of humans in the Karmābhūmi, such as Bharata, Airāvata, Pūrva-Videha, and Apara-Videha, one should state the difference between the inferior and the superior. The difference between the birth of a common human in the Akarmābhūmi and a human in the Karmābhūmi is ten thousand years at the most, because after death, he is born in the inferior category of gods, and from there, he may be born again in the Karmābhūmi as a male or female, and then again as a human in the Akarmābhūmi. The statement that he is born in the Karmābhūmi in between is made because a living being does not directly become a human or a five-sensed animal in the Akarmābhūmi after being born in the Devaloka. The difference from the superior is the duration of a Vanaspathikalpa.

Regarding the duration of the Sanhāra, the difference between the inferior and the superior is an Antarmūhurta (in the case of being taken from the Akarmābhūmi to the Karmābhūmi, after being taken in the Antarmūhurta, due to the change in intellect, he is brought back to the same place) and a Vanaspathikalpa from the superior. After the passage of this time, the Sanhāra also takes place according to the rule, just like the birth in the Akarmābhūmi. In the same way, one should state the difference between the inferior and the superior in terms of birth and Sanhāra in the Akarmābhūmi such as Haimavata, Hairanyavata, etc.

Similarly, one should state the difference between the inferior and the superior in terms of the duration of the Vaktvyata of a human in the Antarvīpaka-Karmābhūmi, as before. After stating the difference between humans, the Sūtrakara states the difference between the Devapurusha, saying that the difference between a common Devapurusha and a superior Devapurusha is an Antarmūhurta from the inferior and a Vanaspathikalpa from the superior.

The difference of an Antarmūhurta is stated because after being born in the Devaloka, he may be born again in the womb of a human after completing the Paryāpti and then, after death, he may be born again in the Devaloka due to his previous determination. The difference from the superior is the duration of a Vanaspathikalpa. In this way, one should state the difference between the gods from the Asurakumāra up to the Sahasrāra (thousandth) Devaloka. The difference between the god of the Prānatakalpa (ninth Devaloka) and the inferior is a Varshāprthaktva.

Because a living being who has been born in the Ānata, etc., Kalpas, and then born again in the Prānatakalpa, etc., can only be born there with a character (Chāritra) according to the rule (in the Manushya-bhava). No living being can be born in the Ānata, etc., Kalpas without a character. The character does not develop before the age of eight years, therefore, the term Varshāprthaktva is used to indicate the difference of eight years. The difference from the superior is the duration of a Vanaspathikalpa.

The difference between the Anuttaroppapātika Kalpātita Devapurusha and the inferior is a Varshāprthaktva, and from the superior, it is a Sankhyeya Sāgara, which is slightly more than the Varshāprthaktva. The difference in the number of Sāgaras should be understood in terms of the birth in the other Vaimānika Devalokas and the birth in the Manushya-bhavas. Although this statement is generally applicable to all Anuttaroppapātika Devalokas, it should be understood in relation to the Vijay, Vaijayanta, Jayanta, and Aparājita Vimānas, because the birth in the Sarvārthasiddha Vimāna happens only once, therefore, there is no possibility of a difference.

The Vṛttikāra, while mentioning a different opinion regarding the difference, says that the difference between the gods from the Bhavanavāsī up to the Iśāna Devaloka is an Antarmūhurta from the inferior, and from the Sanatkumāra up to the Sahasrāra, etc.

##  [155 Second Rebirth: Fewness]

The difference between the Janya Antaras is nine days, from the Panatkalpa to the Achyutkalpa is nine months, and the difference between the nine Veyakas and the remaining Anuttaroppapatik Devas, excluding Sarvarthasiddha, is nine years.

## Second Proposition: Alpabahutva [159 Bahutva has been explained / In which the first, taking Tiryanch, Manushya and Deva Purushas as common, the second taking Tiryanch Yonic Jalchar, Sthalchar, Khechar Purushas, the third taking three types of Manushyas like Karmabhumik, the fourth taking four types of Devas and the fifth taking all of them mixed, Alpabahutva has been explained. The first three Alpabahutvas are like the way they have been said taking their women, in the same way, it should be said taking men here. These three Alpabahutvas have been taken here by the word 'Yavat'. It should be seen in the Alpabahutva of the Stri Prakaran / The only difference is that the word 'Purush' should be used in place of 'Stri'. The fourth Deva Purush related Alpabahutva has been directly said by the Sutrakar in the present Sutra / It is as follows - The least are the Anuttaroppapatik Deva Purushas, because their measure is equal to the amount of Akash Pradeshas of the Asankhyey Bhagavarti Kshetrapalyopama / The Aveyak Deva Purushas above them are Sankhyeyguna / Because they are the measure of the amount of Akash Pradeshas of the Asankhyey Bhagavarti Brihattar Kshetrapalyopama. The number of Vimanas is Sankhyeyguna. There are five Vimanas of the Anuttar Devas and one hundred Vimanas of the Graveyak Devas above them. There are Asankhyey Devas in each Vimana. As the Vimanas are lower, the number of Devas in them is abundant. From this, it is known that the Graveyak Deva Purushas above the Anuttar Vimana Deva Purushas are Sankhyeyguna. The Madhyam Graveyak Deva Purushas are Sankhyeyguna compared to the Aveyak Deva Purushas above them / The Aveyak Deva Purushas below them are Sankhyeyguna, the Achyutkalp Deva Purushas are Sankhyeyguna from them. The Aranakalp Deva Purushas are Sankhyeyguna from them. It is to be known here that although both Aran and Achyut Kalp are of the same series and have the same number of Vimanas, still the Krishnapakshik Jivas and by nature are born in the South direction in more form. Jivas are of two types - Krishnapakshik and Shuklapakshik / Those Jivas who have a little less Arghpudgalparavart Sansar left are Shuklapakshik. Those with a longer Sansar than this are Krishnapakshik. 'Krishnapakshiks are less than Shuklapakshiks. Alpasansari Jivas are few / Krishnapakshiks are many, because the Dirghsansari Jivas are Anantanant / _ There may be a doubt that how can it be considered that Krishnapakshiks are born abundantly in the South direction? Acharyas have said that this happens naturally. Krishnapakshiks are mostly Dirghsansari and Dirghsansaris are mostly born from the rise of many Papkarma. Jivas who have the rise of many Papas are mostly cruel karma and cruel karma Jivas are mostly born in the South direction even though they are Bhavasiddhik by nature / Therefore, due to the abundance of Krishnapakshiks in the South direction, the Aranakalp Deva Purushas are Sankhyeyguna compared to the Achyutkalp Deva Purushas / 1.

## Translation:

[160] The Devapurusha (divine beings) of the Pranatkalpa are innumerable times more than the Devapurusha of the Jeevajeevaabhigamsutra Aranakalpa. The Devapurusha of the Anatkalpa are innumerable times more than those of the Pranatkalpa. Here too, the Devapurusha of the Pranatkalpa are innumerable times more than those of the Pranatkalpa because there are more Krishnapakshika (dark fortnight) births in the southern direction of the Pranatkalpa. All the Uttaraavasi (northern) Devas and the Devas residing in the Pranatkalpa are equal to the number of Aakashapradesha (regions of space) in each Kshetrapalyopam (a specific region of space) multiplied by an innumerable number. Only the innumerable parts are of innumerable types, therefore there is no contradiction in the aforementioned innumerability. The Devapurusha of the Sahasraarkalpa are innumerable times more than the Devapurusha of the Anatkalpa because they are equal to the number of Aakashapradesha in an innumerable part of a regional category of the Ghanikritaloka (dense world). The Devapurusha of the Mahashukrakalpa are innumerable times more than those of the Sahasraarkalpa because they are equal to the number of Aakashapradesha in an innumerable part of a larger category. This innumerability should be understood from the abundance of Vimana (aerial chariots). The number of Vimana in the Sahasraarkalpa is six thousand, while in the Mahashukrakalpa there are forty thousand Vimana. The lower Vimana have more Devapurusha than the higher ones. The Devapurusha of the Lantkalpa are innumerable times more than those of the Mahashukrakalpa because they are equal to the number of Aakashapradesha in an innumerable part of the largest category. The Devapurusha of the Brahmaloka are innumerable times more than those of the Lantkalpa because they are equal to the number of Aakashapradesha in an innumerable part of a larger category. The Devapurusha of the Mahendrakalpa are innumerable times more than those of the Brahmaloka because they are equal to the number of Aakashapradesha in an innumerable part of an even larger category. The Devas of the Sanatkumarakalpa are innumerable times more than those of the Mahendrakalpa because of the abundance of Vimana. There are twelve lakh Vimana in the Sanatkumarakalpa and eight lakh Vimana in the Mahendrakalpa. Another reason is that the Sanatkumarakalpa is in the southern direction and the Mahendrakalpa is in the northern direction. There are many Krishnapakshika births in the southern direction, therefore the Devapurusha of the Sanatkumarakalpa are innumerable times more than those of the Mahendrakalpa. The Devas from the Sahasraarkalpa to the Sanatkumarakalpa are equal to the number of Aakashapradesha in an innumerable part of a category of the Ghanikritaloka in their respective locations, but since the innumerable parts of the category are of innumerable types, there is no contradiction in saying that they are innumerable times more. The Devapurusha of the Ishanakalpa are innumerable times more than those of the Sanatkumarakalpa because they are equal to the number of Aakashapradesha in thirty-two parts of a regional category of the Ghanikritaloka, which is obtained by multiplying the square root of the region of space of an angul (finger width) by its cube root. The Devapurusha of the Saudharmakalpa are innumerable times more than those of the Ishanakalpa. This should be understood from the abundance of Vimana. There are twenty-eight lakh Vimana in the Ishanakalpa and thirty-two lakh Vimana in the Saudharmakalpa. Another reason is that the Saudharmakalpa is in the southern direction and the Ishanakalpa is in the northern direction. Krishnapakshika births are naturally more in the southern direction, therefore the Devas of the Saudharmadevloka are innumerable times more than those of the Ishanadevloka. There is a doubt here that the same logic has been mentioned for the Sanatkumarakalpa and the Mahendrakalpa. Then, there it has been said that the number of Devas in the Sanatkumarakalpa is innumerable times more than those in the Mahendrakalpa, and here it has been said that the number of Devas in the Saudharmakalpa is...

## Second Consideration: Alpabahutva [161]

Why is the number of *Ishaan* considered as the proof? The answer is that it is so by nature. This is stated in all the scriptures like *Prajnaapana* etc.

The *Bhavanaaasi* Devas are countless times more than the *Soudharma* Devas. Because, the number of *Aakash Pradesh* in one *Pradeshika* category of the dense *Lok* is equal to the square root of the square root of the *Pradesh* quantity of an area of one *Angul* (finger width). The *Bhavanaaasi* Devas are 32 times more than this number.

The *Vyantar* Devas are countless times more than the *Bhavanaaasi* Devas. Because, the number of *Khand* in one *Pradeshika* category is equal to the number of *Kodaakodi* *Yojan* in one *Pratar*. The *Vyantar* Devas are 32 times more than this number.

The *Jyotishk* Devas are countless times more than the *Vyantar* Devas. Because, the number of *Khand* in one *Pratar* is equal to the number of *Pradeshika* categories in 256 *Angul*. The *Jyotishk* Devas are 32 times more than this number.

Now, the fifth *Alpabahutva* is the least number of *Antarveepik* humans. Because, their area is small. The humans of *Devakuru* and *Uttarakuru* are countless times more than them, because their area is large. Both are equal in their respective places, because their areas are equal.

The humans of *Harivarsh* and *Ramyakavarsh* are countless times more than the humans of *Devakuru* and *Uttarakuru*, because their area is much larger. Both are equal in their respective places, because their areas are equal.

The humans of *Haemvat* and *Haranvavt* are countless times more than the humans of *Harivarsh* and *Ramyakavarsh*, because even though their area is small, their abundance is due to the smallness of their location. Both are equal in their respective places.

The humans of *Bharat* and *Airavat* *Karmabhoomi* are countless times more than the humans of *Haemvat* and *Haranvavt*, because during the time of *Ajit* Prabhu, there is naturally an abundance of humans in the highest position. Both are equal in their respective places, because their areas are equal.

The humans of *Purva Videh* and *Paschim Videh* are countless times more than the humans of *Bharat* and *Airavat* *Karmabhoomi*, because their area is large and naturally there is an abundance of humans during the time of *Ajit* Swami. Both are equal in their respective places.

The *Anuttaroppaatik* Devas are countless times more than the humans of *Purva Videh* and *Paschim Videh*. Because, they are equal to the number of *Aakash Pradesh* in countless parts of the *Kshetrapalyopama*.

The *Uparitan Aveyak* Devas, *Madhyam Aveyak* Devas, *Adhastan Greveyak* Devas, *Achyutkalp* Devas, *Paranakalp* Devas, *Pranatakalp* Devas, and *Anatakalp* Devas are countless times more than the *Anuttaroppaatik* Devas, in that order.

The *Sahasraarakalp* Devas, *Lantakalp* Devas, *Brahmalokkalp* Devas, *Maheendrakalp* Devas, *Sanatkumarakalp* Devas, and *Ishaanakalp* Devas are countless times more than the previous Devas, in that order.

The *Soudharmakalp* Devas are countless times more than the *Ishaanakalp* Devas.

The *Bhavanaaasi* Devas are countless times more than the *Soudharmakalp* Devas.

The *Khechar* *Tiryanch* *Yoni* are countless times more than the *Bhavanaaasi* Devas. Because, they are equal to the number of *Aakash Pradesh* in countless parts of countless *Shreni* in one *Pratar*.

## 162] The number of terrestrial beings is multiplied by the number of aquatic beings, and that product is multiplied by the number of Vānavyantara Devas. This is because the number of Vānavyantara Devas is equal to the number of yojana-kotis in one pratar, which is the measure of one pradeshika श्रेणी, divided by 32. This number is then multiplied by the number of Jyotishka Devas. The method has been explained before.

**The state of the Purushaveda** 57. "O Bhagavan, how long is the state of bondage for the Purushaveda?" "Gautama, the lowest state of bondage is eight years, and the highest state is ten koḍakoḍi sāgaropamas. There is a period of one thousand years of uninterrupted time. The state without uninterrupted time is karma-niṣeka (ready for fruition)." "O Bhagavan, how is the Purushaveda described?" "Gautama, it is described as being like a forest fire." This is the full right of the Purusha. [57]

The discussion is about the lowest state of the Purushaveda, which is eight years, because there are no karmas that are worthy of bondage for a Purushaveda in a state lower than this. The highest state is ten koḍakoḍi sāgaropamas. The state is described in two ways: (1) as it exists in the form of karma, and (2) as it is experienced. The state that is described here is the state of karma-pravṛtti. The state that is experienced is the state without uninterrupted time. No karma can bear fruit without the completion of uninterrupted time. The measure of uninterrupted time is explained as follows: the uninterrupted time for a karma is equal to the number of koḍakoḍi sāgaropamas in its highest state. The highest state of the Purushaveda is ten koḍakoḍi sāgaropamas, so its uninterrupted time is ten hundred (one thousand) years. The state without uninterrupted time is the state that is experienced, which is karma-niṣeka, meaning the special arrangement for the karma-dalikas to enter the udya-avali. The Purushaveda is described as being like a forest fire, meaning that it is initially intense with the fire of desire, but it quickly becomes extinguished.

**The description of the Napumsaka** 58. "What is a Napumsaka?" "A Napumsaka is described in three ways: (1) Neraya Napumsaka, (2) Tirikṣajoniya Napumsaka, and (3) Manusṣajoniya Napumsaka."

What is a *Panchidyatirikhkhjoonianapumsaka*? A *Panchidyatirikhkhjoonianapumsaka* is described in three ways: *Tanjahar* *Jalayara*, *Thalayara*, *Khahayara*.

What is a *Jalayara*? It is described as *Puvyuttabhedo Asaliyavajjio Bhaniyavyo*. This is a *Panchidyatirikhkhjoonianapumsaka*.

What is a *Manussanapumsaka*? A *Manussanapumsaka* is described in three ways: *Tanjahar* *Kammabhumga*, *Afammabhumga*, *Antardivaga* *Bhedo Javad Bhaniyavyo*.

[164] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra [59] Bhanta! What are eunuchs and how many types are there? Gautam! Eunuchs are of three types, namely: 1. Naireyik eunuch, 2. Tiryanchyoonik eunuch and 3. Manushyayonik eunuch. How many types of Naireyik eunuchs are there? Naireyik eunuchs are of seven types, namely: Ratnaprabhaprithvi Naireyik eunuch, Sharkaraprabhaprithvi Naireyik eunuch, up to Adhasaptamapৃথিবী Naireyik eunuch.

## Second Rebirth: The State of Eunuchs [165]

There are five types of eunuchs with one sense organ - Earth-bodied, Water-bodied, Fire-bodied, Air-bodied and Plant-bodied eunuchs. There are many types of eunuchs with two, three and four sense organs. All the distinctions mentioned in the first rebirth should be mentioned here. There are three types of five-sense organ eunuchs in the animal realm - aquatic eunuchs, terrestrial eunuchs and aerial eunuchs. Their sub-types should be mentioned according to the first rebirth. The authority of the *Prasalika* should not be mentioned. Because *Prasalika* are sometimes born in the *Skandhavara* etc. of the Chakravarti and have a lifespan of only a moment, therefore their mention here is not necessary. There are three types of human eunuchs - *Karmabhumik*, *Akarmabhumik* and *Antarvipik* eunuchs. Their distinctions should be mentioned according to the first rebirth.

## Second Rebirth: The State of the Eunuch [167]

**Discussion:** After explaining the various types of eunuchs and their rights, this sutra describes their state. Generally, the lowest state of an eunuch is an instant (antarmuhurt) and the highest is thirty-three oceans (tetis sagaropama). The lowest state of an instant is in comparison to a human eunuch, and the highest state of thirty-three oceans is in comparison to a eunuch in the seventh earth hell (saptamaprithvi narak).

**Specific Explanation:** This refers to the state of the hell eunuchs. Generally, the lowest state of a hell eunuch is ten thousand years and the highest is thirty-three oceans. In specific explanation, the state of the eunuchs in different hell earths is as follows:

| Hell Earth | Eunuch | Lowest State | Highest State |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ratnaprabhanarak | Ratnaprabhanarak Eunuch | Ten thousand years | One ocean |
| Sharkaraprabhanarak | Sharkaraprabhanarak Eunuch | One ocean | Three oceans |
| Balukaprabhanarak | Balukaprabhanarak Eunuch | Three oceans | Seven oceans |
| Pankaprabhanarak | Pankaprabhanarak Eunuch | Seven oceans | Ten oceans |
| Dhumpaprabhanarak | Dhumpaprabhanarak Eunuch | Ten oceans | Seventeen oceans |
| Namahprabhanarak | Namahprabhanarak Eunuch | Seventeen oceans | Twenty-two oceans |
| Adhasaptamanarak | Adhasaptamanarak Eunuch | Twenty-two oceans | Thirty-three oceans |

Generally, the lowest state of a transmigratory eunuch (tiryanch) is an instant and the highest is the previous birth (purvakoti). The state of transmigratory eunuchs is as follows:

| Type of Transmigratory Eunuch | Lowest State | Highest State |
|---|---|---|
| One-sense eunuch (ekendriya) | Instant | Twenty-two thousand years |
| Earth-bodied eunuch (prithvikaaya) | Twenty-two thousand years | Seven thousand years |
| Fire-bodied eunuch (tejaskaaya) | Three days | Three thousand years |
| Air-bodied eunuch (vayukaaya) | Three thousand years | Ten thousand years |
| Plant-bodied eunuch (vanaspatikaaya) | Ten thousand years | Twelve years |
| Two-sense eunuch (dvendriya) | Twelve years | Fifty days |
| Three-sense eunuch (triendriya) | Fifty days | Six months |
| Four-sense eunuch (chaturindriya) | Six months | Previous birth |
| Five-sense eunuch (panchendriya) | Previous birth | Previous birth |

Transmigratory eunuchs include aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial beings.

##  [168] [Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra] The state of human eunuchs, the most inferior and superior among human eunuchs:

1. **Samuccaya** human eunuchs: **Antarmuhurta** (inner moment) prior to the **Purvakoti** (first stage).
2. **Karmabhoomi** human eunuchs: **Kshetra** (field) prior to the **Purvakoti**.
3. **Karmabhoomi** human eunuchs: **Dharmacharan** (religious practice) prior to the **Deshon** (country).

6. **Purva-Videha** human eunuchs: **Kshetra** prior to the **Purvakoti**.
7. **Paschima-Videha** human eunuchs: **Dharmacharan** prior to the **Deshon**.
8. **Akarmabhoomi** human eunuchs: (born as) (only **Samuchchhim** (collected), not **Garbhaja** (born from womb) / not eunuchs in the **Yugali** (fingers)). **Brihattar Antarmuhurta** (greater inner moment).
9. **Akarmabhoomi** human eunuchs: **Sanharan** (destruction) prior to the **Deshon**.
10. **Haimavata** and **Hairanyavata** human eunuchs: born as **Brihattar Antarmuhurta**.
11. **Haimavata** and **Hairanyavata** human eunuchs: **Sanharan** prior to the **Deshon**.
12. **Harivarsha** and **Ramyakavarsha** human eunuchs: born as **Brihattar Antarmuhurta**.
13. **Harivarsha** and **Ramyakavarsha** human eunuchs: **Sanharan** prior to the **Deshon**.
14. **Devakuru** and **Uttarakuru** human eunuchs: born as **Brihattar Antarmuhurta**.
15. **Devakuru** and **Uttarakuru** human eunuchs: **Sanharan** prior to the **Deshon**.

In this way, the state of Naraka (hell) eunuchs, Tiryaak (animal) eunuchs, and human eunuchs has been explained.

## Second Discourse: On the Duration of Non-Human Existence (Nupunsaka)

## Second Chapter: Interval [171]

The lifespan of a two-sense neuter being is from an antarmukha (instant) at the lowest to a sankhyatkal (countable time) at the highest. This sankhyatkal should be understood as a countable thousand years. Similarly, the lifespan of three-sense and four-sense neuter beings should also be stated.

The lifespan of a five-sense tiryanch neuter being is from an antarmukha at the lowest to a purvakotiprithaktva (separation from the previous koti) at the highest. In this, seven bhava (existences) are continuously experienced in relation to the neuter bhava of the purvakoti lifespan. After this, there is definitely a change in ved (knowledge) and bhava.

Similarly, it should be understood in the case of aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial neuter beings. Generally, the lifespan of a human neuter being is also the same - from an antarmukha at the lowest to a purvakotiprithaktva at the highest.

The lifespan of a human neuter being in the karmabhoomi (sphere of action) is from an antarmukha at the lowest to a purvakotiprithaktva at the highest, depending on the region. Depending on the practice of dharma (righteousness), it is from one time at the lowest to a purvakoti at the highest, depending on the country. The feeling is the same as before.

Similarly, the lifespan of a human neuter being in the Bharat-Airavat karmabhoomi and the lifespan of a human neuter being in the Purva-Videha and Paschim-Videha karmabhoomi should also be known.

Generally, the lifespan of a human neuter being in the akarmabhoomi (sphere of inaction) is from an antarmukha at the lowest, depending on birth. In this much time, they experience birth and death many times. At the highest, it is an antarmukhaprithaktva. After this, there is no birth for them there. Depending on the destruction, it is from an antarmukha at the lowest to a purvakoti at the highest, depending on the country.

The lifespan of human neuter beings in the Haimvat, Hairanyavat, Harivarsha, Ramyakavarsha, Devakuru, Uttar Kuru, and Antardeepik should also be known in the same way. This is the description of lifespan.

## Second Chapter: Interval [173]

The interval has been explained, i.e., after leaving the state of being a **napumsaka** (eunuch), how much time elapses before becoming a **napumsaka** again. Generally, while explaining the interval of a **napumsaka**, the Lord says, "Gautama! The interval is from an **antarmūhurta** (a very short time) in the case of the lowest and slightly more than a **sāgaropamashatapṛthaktva** (a hundred times the distance of an ocean) in the case of the highest. Because the duration of **puruṣatva** (masculinity) and **strītvā** (femininity) as obstacles is only this much. As it is said in the **Sangrahaṇīgaṭhā**s, the interval between a woman and a **napumsaka** (in terms of their **sāciṭṭhaṇā** (state of being) is one **samaya** (time) in the case of the lowest and the interval between a man and a **napumsaka** (in terms of their **sāciṭṭhaṇā**) is **sāgarapṛthaktva** (a distance of an ocean) - (by **padakaideśe padasamudāyopachāra** (a general term for a group of words) - **sāgaropamashatapṛthaktva** (a hundred times the distance of an ocean) in the case of the highest."

In the general sense, the lowest interval for a **nairyika** (hell-being) **napumsaka** is **antarmūhurta**. It is called **antarmūhurta** because of the expectation that after emerging from the **saptamanārakapṛthvī** (seventh hell-earth), it will stay in the **tandulamatsya** (rice-fish) etc. **bhavas** (existences) for **antarmūhurta** and then go back to the **saptama** (seventh) **pṛthvīnārak** (hell-earth). The highest interval is **vanaspatikāla** (the time of a plant). This should be understood as the expectation of staying in **nigoda** (a type of hell) for an infinite time after emerging from the **narakabhava** (hell-existence) according to tradition. Similarly, the interval of **napumsakas** in all seven **narakapṛthvī**s should be understood.

In the general sense, the interval for a **tiryakyoṇi** (animal) **napumsaka** is from **antarmūhurta** in the case of the lowest and **sāgaropamashatapṛthaktva** in the case of the highest. The explanation should be known as before. In the specific sense, generally, the interval for a **ekendriya** (one-sensed) **tiryakyoṇi** **napumsaka** is from **antarmūhurta** (because the obstacle of **dvīndriya** (two-sensed) etc. time is only this much) and the highest is two thousand **sāgaropamas** more than a countable number of years, because the duration of **traskāya** (body of suffering) as an obstacle is only this much. After this much obstacle, it becomes **ekendriya** again. The interval for a **pṛthvīkāyika** (earth-bodied) **ekendriya** **napumsaka** is from **antarmūhurta** in the case of the lowest and **vanaspatikāla** in the case of the highest. Similarly, the interval for **apkaayika** (water-bodied), **tejaskaayika** (fire-bodied), and **vāyukāyika** (air-bodied) **ekendriya** **napumsakas** should also be said. The interval for **vanaspatikāyika** (plant-bodied) **ekendriya** **napumsakas** is from **antarmūhurta** in the case of the lowest and **asanख्येय** (uncountable) time in the case of the highest. This **asanख्येय** time is **asanख्येय** **utsarpiṇī** (ascending) and **avasarpiṇī** (descending) forms in terms of time and **asanख्येय** **loka** (world) measure in terms of space. This means that the **asanख्येय** time is the time taken to completely remove all the regions of **asanख्येय** **lokākāśa** (world-space) by removing one region at a time every **samaya**. After leaving the **vanaspatibhavas** (plant-existences), the living being can stay elsewhere for this much time in the case of the highest. After this, the worldly living being is born again in the **vanaspatikāyika** according to the rule. The interval for **dvīndriya** (two-sensed), **trīndriya** (three-sensed), **caturindriya** (four-sensed), and **pañcendriya** (five-sensed) **tiryakyoṇi** **napumsakas**, the interval for **jalacara** (aquatic), **sthalaacara** (terrestrial), and **khecara** (aerial) **pañcendriya** **tiryakyoṇi** **napumsakas**, and generally the interval for a human **napumsaka** is:

174 [The duration of the Jiva's association with the Jiva is from the most insignificant moment to the infinite time / That infinite time is the plant time, whose nature has been explained earlier. - The human being in the Karmabhoomi is inferior to the insignificant moment and superior to the plant time in comparison to the inner region of the Nasika. In comparison to the practice of Dharma, the most insignificant is one time because the time of the most insignificant attainment is only one time.

## Second Chapter: The Scarcity of Eunuchs

**[177] Gautama!** The fewest eunuchs are those who are *antarvipik* (inhabiting the inner earth). The eunuchs of *Devakuru* and *Uttarakuru* (regions of the earth) are twice as numerous as those of the *antarvipik* region. In this way, the eunuchs of the *karmabhumik* (regions of action) of *Purva Videha* and *Paschim Videha* are twice as numerous as those of *Devakuru* and *Uttarakuru*.

Among the *nairyik* (hellish) eunuchs, the *nairyik* eunuchs of the *Ratnaprabha* earth, and the *nairyik* eunuchs of the seventh earth downwards, among the *tiryanchyonik* (animal) eunuchs, among the *ekendriya* (one-sensed) *tiryanchyonik*, among the *prithvikaayik* (earth-bodied) *ekendriya* *tiryanchyonik*, and among the *vanaspatikaayik* (plant-bodied) *tiryanchyonik*, among the *dwiindriya* (two-sensed), *triindriya* (three-sensed), *chaturindriya* (four-sensed), and *panchendriya* (five-sensed) *tiryanchyonik*, among the *jalachar* (aquatic), *sthalachar* (terrestrial), and *khechar* (aerial) beings, among the human eunuchs, among the *karmabhumik* human eunuchs, among the *akarmabhumik* (regions of inaction) human eunuchs, and among the *antarvipik* human eunuchs, who are fewer, more, equal, or more special than whom?

**Gautama!** The fewest are the *nairyik* eunuchs of the seventh earth downwards. The *nairyik* eunuchs of the sixth earth are countless times more numerous than them. The *nairyik* eunuchs of the second earth are countless times more numerous than those of the sixth earth. The human eunuchs of the *antarvipik* region are countless times more numerous than those of the second earth.

The *vanaspatikaayik* *ekendriya* *tiryanchyonik* eunuchs are infinitely more numerous than the *vaayukaayik* *ekendriya* *tiryanchyonik* eunuchs.

**Discussion:** This sutra explains the scarcity in five ways. Firstly, it describes the general scarcity of *nairyik*, *tiryanchyonik*, and human eunuchs. Secondly, it describes the scarcity of the seven types of *nairyik*. Thirdly, it describes the scarcity of the different types of *tiryanchyonik* eunuchs. Fourthly, it describes the scarcity of the different types of human beings. Fifthly, it describes a mixed scarcity of both general and special types.

**(1)** In the first type of scarcity, it is asked who is fewer, more, equal, or more special than whom among the *nairyik* eunuchs, *tiryanchyonik* eunuchs, and human eunuchs. The answer is...

**[178]** **Jiva-jiva-abhigamsutra:** The least numerous among the **Nairyaika** (human) **Nupunsaka** (eunuchs) are those who are in the **Asankhyeya-bhagavarti** (incalculable parts) regions of the **Shreni** (series) of the **Avyakta** (unmanifest) world. The **Nairyaika** **Nupunsaka** are **Asankhyeya-guna** (incalculable times) more numerous than the **Jiva-jiva** (living beings) **Nupunsaka**, because they are equal to the number of **Prakash-pradesh** (regions of light) in one **Pradeshik-shreni** (series of regions) of the **Dhanikrita-lok** (material world), which is obtained by multiplying the square root of the number of **Pradesh** (regions) in an **Angul-matra** (finger-width) region by its second square root. The **Tiryanchika** (animal) **Nupunsaka** are **Ananta-guna** (infinite times) more numerous than the **Nairyaika** **Nupunsaka**, because the **Nigoda** (animals) are infinite. (2) The **Nairyaika** **Nupunsaka** are least numerous in the seventh **Prithvi** (earth), because their number is equal to the number of **Prakash-pradesh** in the **Avyakta** world, which is **Asankhyeya-bhagavarti** (incalculable parts) of the **Prabhyantara-shreni** (inner series). The **Nairyaika** **Nupunsaka** of the sixth **Prithvi** are **Asankhyeya-guna** (incalculable times) more numerous than those of the seventh **Prithvi**, and so on, with the **Nairyaika** **Nupunsaka** of each successive **Prithvi** being **Asankhyeya-guna** (incalculable times) more numerous than those of the previous one. This is because the number of **Nairyaika** **Nupunsaka** in each **Prithvi** is equal to the number of **Nabha-pradesh** (regions of space) in the **Asankhyeya-guna** (incalculable times) **Asankhyeya-guna** (incalculable times) **Shreni** (series) of the **Avyakta** world, which is **Asankhyeya-bhagavarti** (incalculable parts) of the **Hetubhut-shreni** (causal series) of the previous **Nairyaika** **Nupunsaka**. The **Nairyaika** **Nupunsaka** of the second **Prithvi** are **Asankhyeya-guna** (incalculable times) more numerous than those of the first **Prithvi**, because their number is equal to the number of **Prakash-pradesh** in one **Pradeshik-shreni** (series of regions) of the **Dhanikrita-lok** (material world), which is obtained by multiplying the square root of the number of **Pradesh** (regions) in an **Angul-matra** (finger-width) region by its second square root. In each **Naraka-prithvi** (hellish earth), the **Nairyaika** **Nupunsaka** in the east, north, and west directions are equal in number, while those in the south direction are **Asankhyeya-guna** (incalculable times) more numerous. The **Nairyaika** **Nupunsaka** in the north and west directions of the **Prithvi**s further away from the **Prithvi**s in the south direction are **Asankhyeya-guna** (incalculable times) more numerous than those in the south direction of the previous **Prithvi**s. This is stated in the **Prajnapanasutra** as well. (3) The **Tiryanchika** (animal) **Nupunsaka** are least numerous among the **Khechara** (flying) **Panchendriya** (five-sensed) **Tiryanchika** (animals), because their number is equal to the number of **Prakash-pradesh** in the **Asankhyeya-shreni** (incalculable series) of the **Avyakta** world, which is **Asankhyeya-bhagavarti** (incalculable parts) of the **Pratara** (first).

## Second Chapter: The Relative Scarcity of Eunuchs

**[179]** Eunuchs with four senses (ti. yo.) are more numerous than those with three senses (ti. yo.), because they are as numerous as the regions of space in the dense realms of countless kotis of yojanas, which are as numerous as the regions of space in a single regional category. Eunuchs with three senses (ti. yo.) are more numerous than those with two senses (ti. yo.), because they are as numerous as the regions of space in a more abundant category. Eunuchs with two senses (ti. yo.) are more numerous than those with one sense (ti. yo.) of the luminous body, because they are as numerous as the regions of space in the most abundant category. Eunuchs with one sense (ti. yo.) of the luminous body are countless times more numerous than those with one sense (ti. yo.) of the earthly body, because they are as numerous as the regions of space in countless realms, both subtle and gross. Eunuchs with one sense (ti. yo.) of the earthly body are more numerous than those with one sense (ti. yo.) of the watery body, because they are as numerous as the regions of space in countless realms. Eunuchs with one sense (ti. yo.) of the watery body are more numerous than those with one sense (ti. yo.) of the airy body, because they are as numerous as the regions of space in countless realms. Eunuchs with one sense (ti. yo.) of the airy body are more numerous than those with one sense (ti. yo.) of the vegetal body, because they are as numerous as the regions of space in countless realms. Eunuchs with one sense (ti. yo.) of the vegetal body are infinitely more numerous than human eunuchs, because they are as numerous as the regions of space in infinite realms.

**(4)** Human eunuchs are the least numerous. The least numerous are the human eunuchs of the Antarvipija. These should be understood as a group, because there are no womb-born human eunuchs there. They may have been collected from the karmic realm. The human eunuchs of the Devakuru-Uttarakuru akarmabhumis are numerous times more numerous than the human eunuchs of the Antarvipija, because the womb-born humans there are numerous times more numerous than the womb-born humans of the Antarvipija, because the birth of group-humans occurs from the utterance, etc., of womb-born humans. They are equal to each other in their respective places. The human eunuchs of the Harivarsha-Ramyakavarsha akarmabhumis are numerous times more numerous than those of the Devakuru-Uttarakuru, and they are equal to each other in their respective places. The human eunuchs of the Haimavat-Hairanyavat akarmabhumis are numerous times more numerous than those of the Harivarsha-Ramyakavarsha, and they are equal to each other in their respective places. The human eunuchs of the Bharat-Airavat karmabhumis are numerous times more numerous than those of the Haimavat-Hairanyavat, and they are equal to each other in their respective places. The human eunuchs of the Purva Videha-Paschima Videha karmabhumis are numerous times more numerous than those of the Bharat-Airavat, and they are equal to each other in their respective places. The same logic should be applied everywhere.

"O Bhagavan! What is the definition of the Napunsakaved?" "Gautama! It is defined as the state of being like a great city fire." "O Samanau! That is the Napunsaka." [61]

## Second Chapter: Nine Types of Minor and Major [181]

The uninterrupted period (abādhākāla) for the Nāpusaka Veda is 2000 years. The karma-niṣeka (fructification of karma) occurs from the state that is less than the uninterrupted period, meaning the creation of karma-dalikas (karmic particles) that are capable of experiencing. 

O Bhagavan! How is the experience of the Nāpusaka Veda? 

O Āyushmān Śramaṇa Gautama! It is said to be like the burning of a great city (like the burning fire of desire in all states). 

The discussion in this sūtra refers to the state of bondage (bandhasthiti) of the Nāpusaka Veda. There are two types of states: 1. State of bondage and 2. State capable of experiencing (capable of coming into udāya-avali kā). 

The state of bondage of the Nāpusaka Veda is 3 parts of a sāgaropama (ocean-like) less than an innumerable part of a palyopama (mountain-like). The superior state is of twenty kodakodi sāgaropama. 

Here, the method of obtaining the inferior state, which has been mentioned earlier, should be kept in mind. It is as follows: 

The state of any nature is obtained by subtracting an innumerable part of a palyopama from the amount obtained by dividing the superior state of mithyātva (false belief) of that nature by seventy kodakodi sāgaropama. 

Here, the superior state of the Nāpusaka Veda is twenty kodakodi sāgaropama. Dividing it by seventy kodakodi (zero divided by zero) results in a sāgaropama quotient. Subtracting an innumerable part of a palyopama from this results in the inferior state of the Nāpusaka Veda. 

The uninterrupted period (abādhākāla) of the Nāpusaka Veda is two thousand years. The rule for obtaining the uninterrupted period is that the uninterrupted period of a karma-prakriti (karmic nature) is one hundred years for every kodakodi sāgaropama of its superior state. The uninterrupted period of the Nāpusaka Veda, which has a superior state of twenty kodakodi sāgaropama, is twenty hundred years, i.e., two thousand years. 

The state that remains after subtracting the uninterrupted period from the state of bondage is the one that gives its fruit to the jīva (living being), i.e., it experiences it in udāya (arising). Therefore, the karma-niṣeka (fructification of karma) occurs from the remaining state that is less than the uninterrupted period, meaning the creation of karma-dalikas (karmic particles) that are capable of experiencing. The karma-dalikas begin to arise in udāya (arising). 

After the question regarding the state of bondage of the Nāpusaka Veda, Gautama Svāmī asked how the experience of the Nāpusaka Veda is. In response, the Lord said, "O Āyushmān Śramaṇa Gautama! The experience of the Nāpusaka Veda is like the burning of a great city. Just as the flames of a fire that has spread throughout a great city burn for a long time and are intense, so too is the fire of desire of the Nāpusaka intense and burns for a long time. It remains intense in all states, from beginning to middle to end." 

Thus, the chapter on the Nāpusaka is complete.

Thus, Venerable One! Of the human beings, what is the difference between those who have a karma-bhoomi and those who do not have a karma-bhoomi? What is the difference between human males who have a karma-bhoomi and those who do not have a karma-bhoomi? What is the difference between human females who have a karma-bhoomi and those who do not have a karma-bhoomi? Is it less, more, equal, or Vishesahiya?

Gotama! The human beings who have a karma-bhoomi and the human males who have a karma-bhoomi are equal in number. The human beings who have a karma-bhoomi and the human males who have a karma-bhoomi in the Devakuru and Uttar Kuru are equal in number, Sankhejjaguna. The human beings who have a karma-bhoomi and the human males who have a karma-bhoomi in the Harivas, Rammyavas, and Prakamma-bhoomi are equal in number, Sankhejjaguna.

Similarly, the human females who have a karma-bhoomi in the Puvva Videh are equal in number, Sankhejjaguna. [8]

Thus, Venerable One! Of the Devas, what is the difference between those who reside in Bhavanavasi, Vanamantari, Joisini, and Vamanino? What is the difference between the Deva males who reside in Bhavanavasi, Vanamantari, Joisini, and Vamanino, who are Sohammaka, Gevejjaka, Anuttarovawaiya, and Neraiya? What is the difference between the Neraiya females who reside in Rayapphaba-Pudhavi, Neraiya females who reside in Ahesattama-Pudhavi, and Neraiya females who reside in other Pudhavis? Is it less, more, equal, or Vishesahiya?

Gotama! The Deva males who are Anuttarovawaiya are equal in number. The Deva males who are Uvarima Gevenja are Sankhejjaguna. Similarly, the Deva males who are in the Aanaa Kappe are Sankhejjaguna. The Neraiya females who reside in the Ahesattama Pudhavi are Asankhejjaguna. The Neraiya females who reside in the Chatthi Pudhavi are Sankhejjaguna. The Deva males who are in the Sahassara Kappe are Sankhejjaguna. The Devas who are in the Mahasukke Kappe are Sankhejjaguna.

## Second Chapter: Nine Types of Minor Abundance

**[191]**  There are more female terrestrial *tiryakyonika* than male terrestrial *tiryakyonika*. There are more male aquatic *tiryakyonika* than female aquatic *tiryakyonika*. There are more female aquatic *tiryakyonika* than *vanavyantara* male gods. There are more *vanavyantara* female gods than *jyotishka* male gods. There are more *jyotishka* female gods than *khechara* five-sensed *tiryakyonika* eunuchs. There are more terrestrial *tiryakyonika* eunuchs than aquatic *tiryakyonika* eunuchs. There are more four-sensed eunuchs than three-sensed eunuchs. There are more three-sensed eunuchs than two-sensed eunuchs. There are more luminous one-sensed *tiryakyonika* eunuchs than earth-bodied one-sensed *tiryakyonika* eunuchs. There are more earth-bodied one-sensed *tiryakyonika* eunuchs than formless one-sensed *tiryakyonika* eunuchs. There are more formless one-sensed *tiryakyonika* eunuchs than air-bodied one-sensed *tiryakyonika* eunuchs. There are more air-bodied one-sensed *tiryakyonika* eunuchs than plant-bodied one-sensed *tiryakyonika* eunuchs.

**Discussion:** This sutra describes nine types of minor abundance. 

(1) The first type of minor abundance considers the general abundance of females, males, and eunuchs. 

(2) The second type of minor abundance considers the general abundance of female, male, and eunuch *tiryakyonika*. 

(3) The third type of minor abundance considers the general abundance of female, male, and eunuch humans. 

(4) The fourth type of minor abundance considers the general abundance of female gods, male gods, and hellish eunuchs. There are no eunuchs among gods, and hell beings are only eunuchs. Therefore, the minor abundance of hellish eunuchs is compared with female and male gods. 

(5) The fifth type of minor abundance considers the general abundance of all the aforementioned beings combined. 

(6) The sixth type of minor abundance considers the specific abundance of female, male, and eunuch *tiryakyonika* (in comparison to their different categories). 

(7) The seventh type of minor abundance considers the specific abundance of female, male, and eunuch humans (in comparison to their different categories). 

(8) The eighth type of minor abundance considers the specific abundance of female gods, male gods, and hellish eunuchs (in comparison to their different categories). 

(9) The ninth type of minor abundance considers the combined minor abundance of all the different categories of female, male, and eunuch *tiryakyonika*, humans, and gods. 

The *Malayagirivritti* mentions only eight types of minor abundance. The first type of minor abundance, which considers the general abundance of females, males, and eunuchs, is not mentioned in the *vritti*. The *vrittikara* begins the discussion of minor abundance with the text "Eyasim gan bhanta! Tirikhkajoniya itthina." 

Page #236:
---------------------------
[192] The explanation of the principle of *alpabahutva* (fewness and manyness) in the *jivajivaabhigamsutra* is clear from the original meaning itself, and all types of living beings have been explained and proven in detail in previous contexts. Therefore, it is unnecessary to repeat it here. The situation of women, men, and eunuchs as a community is as follows: [63] "O Bhagavan! How long is the state of women said to be?" "Gautama! The statement 'from one perspective' etc., which was made in the case of women, should be said here as well. Similarly, the situation of men and eunuchs should be understood in the same way as before. The *sanchittana* (physical state) of all three and the difference between them should also be stated here (as a community) in the same way as it was stated in their respective contexts." The present sutra is a compilation of the descriptions of the time-state (state of existence), *sanchittana* (physical state), and difference etc. of women, men, and eunuchs, which were previously described in separate contexts. The statement made in the previous contexts is intended to be stated here as a community, so there is no question of repetition. The commentator has considered the text here to be the same as the first *alpabahutva* given in the previous sutra related to *alpabahutva*. It is as follows: "O Bhagavan! How many women, men, and eunuchs are there in the world, who are either few or many? All men are many, women are countless, and eunuchs are infinite." Since the above *alpabahutva* mentions women, men, and eunuchs as a community, the commentator has included it in the community context. This particular text is relevant here because of the community situation, *sanchittana*, difference, and community *alpabahutva*. However, due to the similarity of *alpabahutva*, the text has been given in the previous sutra as the first *alpabahutva* along with the *alpabahutvas*. Thus, there is only a difference in location, not in meaning. The abundance of women over men: [64] "The number of *tirikkhja* (non-human) women is three times that of *tirikkhja* men. The number of *massithya* (human) women is twenty-seven times that of *manussapurisa* (human) men. The number of *devi* (divine) women is thirty-two times that of *devapurisa* (divine) men. These three types of living beings are said to be present in the world. There is a difference in their number, their *sanchittana*, and their *alpabahutva*. Their *vevana* (karma) and *bandha* (bondage) are also different. What is the reason for this?" // 1 // "These three types of living beings are said to be present in the world."

## Second Proposition: The Superiority of Women over Men

[193 [64] Women in the animal realm are three times and three forms more than men in the animal realm. Human women are twenty-seven times and twenty-seven forms more than human men. Divine women are thirty-two times and thirty-two forms more than divine men. Thus, the three types of beings who end the cycle of existence have been explained. (Collected Verse)

This second proposition, which is based on the three Vedas, first deals with the difference in authority. Then it discusses the state, accumulation, difference, and scarcity of authority. After that, it describes the state of bondage of the Vedas and the nature of their experience. 

**Discussion:** It was previously stated that women are more numerous than men. A natural question arises: how much more numerous are they? This sutra answers this question. Women in the animal realm are three times more numerous than men in the animal realm. The word "guna" can also mean "quality," so the phrase "three forms more" is added for clarity. Here, "guna" refers to number. Human women are twenty-seven times more numerous than human men, and divine women are thirty-two times more numerous than divine men.

At the end of this second proposition, a verse is given to summarize the topic. It states that this second proposition, which deals with the three Vedas, first discusses the difference, then the state, accumulation (body state), difference, and scarcity in succession. After that, it discusses the state of bondage of the Vedas and the nature of their experience. 

**OC 1.**  Women in the animal realm are three times and three forms more than men. Human women are twenty-seven times and twenty-seven forms more than human men. Divine women are thirty-two times and thirty-two forms more than divine men. This is the knowledge given by the Jinas regarding the passions and aversions of the soul.

The third attainment in the fourfold attainment has discussed the three types of beings who have attained liberation from the cycle of birth and death. Now, the third attainment in the sequence is discussing the four types of beings who have attained liberation from the cycle of birth and death. Its initial aphorism is as follows:

**Four types of beings who have attained liberation from the cycle of birth and death** 65. Those who say that there are four types of beings who have attained liberation from the cycle of birth and death, they state it as follows: namely, **Nairyika**, **Tiryachyonika**, **Manushya**, and **Deva**. [65]

**What is the nature of Nairyika?** Nairyika are said to be of seven types, namely: **Prathama-Pruthvi-Nairyika**, **Dvitiya-Pruthvi-Nairyika**, **Tartiya-Pruthvi-Nairyika**, **Chaturtha-Pruthvi-Nairyika**, **Panchama-Pruthvi-Nairyika**, **Shashtha-Pruthvi-Nairyika**, and **Saptama-Pruthvi-Nairyika**. [66]

**O Bhagavan! What is the name and lineage of the first earth?** Gautama! The name of the first earth is **Dhamma** and its lineage is **Ratnaprabha**. [67]

**O Bhagavan! What is the name and lineage of the second earth?**

## Third Rebirth: Four Types of World-Ending Beings

[195] Gautama! The name of the second earth is Vansa and its gotra is Sharkaraprabha. In this way, you should ask questions about all the earths. Their names are as follows: the name of the third earth is Shaila, the name of the fourth earth is Anjana, the name of the fifth earth is Ristha, the name of the sixth earth is Magha, and the name of the seventh earth is Maghavati. 

The gotra of the third earth is Balukaprabha, the gotra of the fourth earth is Pankaprabha, the gotra of the fifth earth is Dhumarprabha, the gotra of the sixth earth is Tamahprabha, and the gotra of the seventh earth is Tamas-tamahprabha.

[68] Venerable one! How thick is this Ratnapraba earth said to be? Gautama! This Ratnapraba earth is one lakh eighty thousand yojanas thick. In the same way, the thickness of the remaining earths should be known from this gatha:

"The first earth is one lakh eighty thousand yojanas thick. The second earth is one lakh thirty-two thousand yojanas thick. The third earth is one lakh twenty-eight thousand yojanas thick. The fourth earth is one lakh twenty thousand yojanas thick. The fifth earth is one lakh eighteen thousand yojanas thick. The sixth earth is one lakh sixteen thousand yojanas thick. The seventh earth is one lakh eight thousand yojanas thick."

**Discussion:** (From verses 65 to 66) Among the ten types of rebirths previously discussed, the Acharyas who speak of four types of world-ending beings, do so by taking the four types of beings: 1) Nairyaik beings of the hell realm, 2) beings of the animal realm, 3) beings of the human realm, and 4) beings of the god realm. 

When this is said, there is a natural curiosity about where the Nairyaik and other beings reside, what are the names, gotras, and extent of their dwelling places, the hell realms? Various information about the hell realms and the hell beings is given in these sutras and in the following sutras. 

First, a question is asked about the types of hell beings. In response, it is said that there are seven types of hell beings. Seven types of hell beings are mentioned in relation to the seven hell realms, such as the first earth Nairyaik to the seventh earth Nairyaik. 

After this, there are questions and answers about the names and gotras of the hell realms. The difference between name and gotra is that the name is eternally established and without meaning, meaning that the name does not necessarily have to have qualities corresponding to it, while the gotra is primarily based on qualities. 

The names and gotras of the seven earths are as follows:

## 196] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra named Gotra Bahalya (in yojanas) Prithvi First Prithvi Second Prithvi Third Prithvi Fourth Prithvi Fifth Prithvi Sixth Prithvi Seventh Prithvi Ghamma Vansa Shaila Anjana Ristha Madha Maghavati Ratnaprabha Sharkaraprabha Balukaprabha Pankaprabha Dhamprabha Tamprabha Tamatamprabha one lakh eighty thousand one lakh thirty-two thousand one lakh twenty-eight thousand one lakh twenty thousand one lakh eighteen thousand one lakh sixteen thousand one lakh eight thousand.

The prominence of the Gotra is more important than the name, therefore the question has been asked mentioning the Gotra of Ratnaprabha etc. and the answer has been given in the same way. The Gotras of the Narakabhumi are according to their meaning, therefore explaining their meaning, the ancient teachers have said that where there is an abundance of gems, it is Ratnaprabha. Here, the meaning of 'Prabha' is abundance. Similarly, one should understand the same for the rest of the Prithvis. Where there is a predominance of sugar (gravel), it is Sharkaraprabha. Where there is a predominance of sand, it is Balukaprabha. Where there is a predominance of mud, it is Pankaprabha. Where there is a glow like smoke, it is Dhumarprabha. Where there is an abundance of darkness, it is Tamasprabha and where there is an abundance of very dense darkness, it is Tamatamprabha. Here, in some copies, two Sangrahani Gatha are given which tell the names and Gotras of these Prithvis; which are given in the footnote below.

After this, there are questions and answers regarding the thickness of each Narakprithvi. The abundance (thickness) of Narakprithvis has been mentioned in the brackets above.

##  [198] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra Vivcehan - This sutra asks about the types (divisions) of the earth Ratnaprabha, etc. The answer states that there are three types (divisions) of Ratnaprabha earth, namely - Kharakanda, Pankabahulkaanda and Apbahulkaanda. Kaanda means - specific land / Khar means hard / The first Kharakanda of Ratnaprabha earth has 16 divisions / The first division called Ratnakaanda, the second division called Vajrakaanda, the third division called Vaidaryakaanda, and so on, the sixteenth division called Rishtar Ratnakaanda. There are sixteen divisions of Kharakanda of Ratnaprabha according to the names of sixteen gems / Each kaanda is one thousand yojan thick / Thus, Kharakanda is sixteen thousand yojan thick. From the said Ratnakaanda to Rishtkaanda, all kaandas are of the same type, i.e. they have no further divisions. The second kaanda is Pankabahul / It has an abundance of mud and has no further divisions, so it is of one type. This second kaanda is 84 thousand yojan thick / The third Apbahulkaanda has an abundance of water and has no divisions, it is of one type. It is 80 thousand yojan thick / Thus, by combining the three kaandas of Ratnaprabha, the total thickness of Ratnaprabha becomes (16+84+80) one lakh eighty thousand. The other Narakaprithvi, from Sharkaraprabha to Adhasaptamapৃথিবী, have no divisions / They are all of the same size / The number of Narakavasa is 70.  From this, O Bhavan! How many lakhs of Narakavasa are there in the Ratnaprabha earth? Gautama! Thirty lakhs of Narakavasa are mentioned. According to this gatha, the number of Narakavasa in the seven Narakas should be known / In the first earth, thirty lakhs, in the second, twenty-five lakhs, in the third, fifteen lakhs, in the fourth, ten lakhs, in the fifth, three lakhs, in the sixth, five less than one lakh, and in the seventh earth, there are five Anuttara Mahaan Narakavasa. The five very large Anuttara Mahaan Narakavasa mentioned in Adhasaptamapৃথিবী are - 1. Kaal, 2. Mahakaal, 3. Rouru, 4. Maharouru and 5. Apratishthan / Vivcehan - This sutra mentions the number of Narakavasa in each Narakaprithvi /

##  Number of Hells in the Jain Cosmology

**Creation and Types of Hells:**

There are two types of hells in the six earths, starting from the first Ratnapraba earth and ending with the sixth Tamahpraba earth: **Pravalikapravisht** and **Prakirnak**.  The hells that are arranged in a row are **Pravalikapravisht**, and those that are scattered are **Prakirnak**.

**Ratnapraba Earth:**

* Ratnapraba earth has thirteen **Prastara** (layers). Each **Prastara** is like a house.
* The first **Prastara** has 49 hells in each of the four directions (East, West, North, South) and 48 hells in each of the four intermediate directions (Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, Southwest). In the middle is a **Narakendraka** called **Simantaka**.
* In the remaining twelve **Prastara**, the number of hells decreases by eight in each direction and intermediate direction. 
* Therefore, the first **Prastara** has 389 hells, the second has 381, the third has 373, and so on.
* In total, there are 4433 **Pravalikapravisht** hells in the thirteen **Prastara** of Ratnapraba earth.

* The first **Prastara** has 36 **Pravalikapravisht** hells in each of the four directions, 35 in each of the four intermediate directions, and one **Narakendraka** in the middle, totaling 285 hells.
* In the remaining ten **Prastara**, the number of hells decreases by eight in each direction and intermediate direction.
* In total, there are 2695 **Pravalikapravisht** hells in the eleven **Prastara** of Sharkara Praba earth.
* The remaining 2,497,305 hells are **Prakirnak**.
* In total, there are 2.5 million hells in the second Sharkara Praba earth.

**Balukapraba Earth:**

* Balukapraba earth has nine **Prastara**.
* The first **Prastara** has 25 hells in each of the four directions, 24 in each of the four intermediate directions, and one **Narakendraka** in the middle, totaling 197 **Pravalikapravisht** hells.
* In the remaining eight **Prastara**, the number of hells decreases by eight in each direction and intermediate direction.
* In total, there are 1485 **Pravalikapravisht** hells in the nine **Prastara** of Balukapraba earth.
* The remaining 1,498,515 hells are **Prakirnak**.
* In total, there are 1.5 million hells in the third Balukapraba earth.

**Pankapraba Earth:**

* Pankapraba earth has seven **Prastara**.
* The first **Prastara** has 16 **Pravalikapravisht** hells in each of the four directions, 15 in each of the four intermediate directions, and one **Narakendraka** in the middle, totaling 125 hells.

## Third Chapter: Inquiry about the Ghonodadhi, etc.

[201 Inquiry about the Ghonodadhi, etc.] 71. "Venerable Sir! Below this Ratnaprabha earth, is there a Ghonodadhi, a Ghanavat, a Tanuvat, and pure Akasha?" "Yes, Gautama! There is." / "Similarly, below all seven earths, there is a Ghonodadhi, a Ghanavat, a Tanuvat, and pure Akasha." [71]

**Explanation:**

This Sutra explains the foundation of the Naraka earths. It is natural to question what these seven Naraka earths are based on. The Sutrakar answers that these earths are situated on frozen water, which is called Ghonodadhi. 

The question arises: what is the Ghonodadhi based on? The answer is that the Ghonodadhi is situated on Ghanavat, which is solidified air. Ghanavat is based on Tanuvat (light air), and Tanuvat is established on Akasha. Akasha is self-established and does not depend on anything. 

Therefore, Akasha supports Tanuvat, Tanuvat supports Ghanavat, Ghanavat supports Ghonodadhi, and Ghonodadhi supports the Ratnaprabha and other earths.

One might question how the earth can be supported by air and the ocean by the earth. This is explained through a worldly example. 

Imagine a person inflating a bladder with air. They then tie the mouth of the bladder tightly with a ribbon and also tie the middle part of the bladder. This creates two sections of air within the bladder, making it resemble a drum. Then, the person opens the mouth of the bladder, removes the air from the upper section, and fills it with water. They then tie the mouth again and untie the middle section. The water in the upper section will remain there, above the air in the lower section, and will not fall down. Just as the water rests on the air below, the Ghonodadhi can rest on the Ghanavat.

Another example is a person wearing a container filled with air around their waist and entering deep water. They will remain on the surface of the water and not sink. They will be supported by the water. Similarly, the earths can rest on the Ghonodadhi.

These seven Naraka earths are situated one below the other, but they are not directly touching. There is a significant distance between them. Within this distance, the Ghonodadhi, Ghanavat, Tanuvat, and pure Akasha are situated one below the other.

**First:** 1. Ratnasharkara, Valuka, Pank, Dhuma, Tamo, Maha-tamo, Prabha bhumis are established on Ghonodadhi, Vata, and Akasha. These seven are situated one below the other. - Tattvarth Sutra A. 3. 

Page #246:
---------------------------
[202] The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra states that below the Naraka-bhoomi is the Ghano-dadhi, below that is the Ghana-vat, below that is the Tanu-vat, and below that is the Akash. After the Akash is the second Naraka-bhoomi. Between the second and third Naraka-bhoomi, there is also Ghano-dadhi, Ghana-vat, Tanu-vat, and Akash in that order. In the same way, below all the bhoomis up to the seventh Naraka-prithvi, there is Ghano-dadhi etc. in the same order. Now the Sutrakar describes the thickness (bahalya) of the Ratna-kanda etc. - The thickness of the Ratna-kanda etc. is 72.  

"O Bhagavan! What is the thickness of the Khar-kanda of this Ratna-prabha-prithvi?" 
"Gautama! It is said to be sixteen thousand yojan thick." 

"O Bhagavan! What is the thickness of the Ratna-kanda of this Ratna-prabha-prithvi?" 
"Gautama! It is said to be one thousand yojan thick." 

And so on until the Rishta-kanda. 

"O Bhagavan! What is the thickness of the Pank-bahul-kanda of this Ratna-prabha-prithvi?" 
"Gautama! It is said to be eighty-four thousand yojan thick." 

"O Bhagavan! What is the thickness of the Ava-bahul-kanda of this Ratna-prabha-prithvi?" 
"Gautama! It is said to be eighty thousand yojan thick." 

"O Bhagavan! What is the thickness of the Ghano-dadhi of this Ratna-prabha-prithvi?" 
"Gautama! It is said to be twenty thousand yojan thick." 

"O Bhagavan! What is the thickness of the Ghana-vat of this Ratna-prabha-prithvi?" 
"Gautama! It is said to be countless yojan thick." 

And so on for the Tanu-vat and the Pro-vasantara. 

"O Bhagavan! What is the thickness of the Ghano-dadhi of this Sakkara-prabha-prithvi?" 
"Gautama! It is said to be twenty thousand yojan thick." 

"O Bhagavan! What is the thickness of the Ghana-vat of this Sakkara-prabha-prithvi?" 
"Gautama! It is said to be countless yojan thick." 

And so on for the Tanu-vat and the Pro-vasantara. 

Just as in the Sakkara-prabha-prithvi, so it is for all the bhoomis up to the Ahesattama. [72]

## Third Chapter: The Existence of Substances in the Ratnaprabha Earth

**[203]** **Lord!** How thick is the *apbahulkaanda* of this Ratnaprabha earth? **Gautama!** It is eighty thousand yojanas thick. **Lord!** How thick is the *ghanodadhi* of this Ratnaprabha earth? **Gautama!** It is twenty thousand yojanas thick. **Lord!** How thick is the *ghanavaat* of this Ratnaprabha earth? **Gautama!** It is countless thousands of yojanas thick. Similarly, the *tanuvaat* and the *aakash* are also countless thousands of yojanas thick. **Lord!** How thick is the *ghanodadhi* of the Sharkara-prabha earth? **Gautama!** It is twenty thousand yojanas thick. **Lord!** How thick is the *ghanavaat* of the Sharkara-prabha earth? **Gautama!** It is countless thousands of yojanas thick. Similarly, the *tanuvaat* and the *aakash* are also countless thousands of yojanas thick. Just as the thickness of the *ghanodadhi*, *ghanavaat*, *tanuvaat* and *aakash* of the Sharkara-prabha earth has been stated, so should it be known for all the remaining earths (up to the seventh earth).

**Discussion:** Earlier, the external dimensions of the hell earths were stated. In this sutra, the three *kaanda*s of the Ratnaprabha earth and the external dimensions of the *ghanodadhi*, *ghanavaat*, *tanuvaat* and *aakash* have been explained. The *kaanda*s are only present in the Ratnaprabha earth. There are sixteen divisions of the *kharakaanda* and the external dimension of each division has been stated as one thousand yojanas. The total external dimension of the sixteen *kaanda*s is sixteen thousand yojanas. The *pankabahul*, the second *kaanda*, has an external dimension of eighty-four thousand yojanas and the *apbahul*, the third *kaanda*, has an external dimension of eighty thousand yojanas. Thus, adding the external dimensions of all three *kaanda*s of the Ratnaprabha earth, the thickness of the Ratnaprabha earth is one lakh eighty thousand yojanas. Below each earth, there is successively the *ghanodadhi*, *ghanavaat*, *tanuvaat* and *aakash*. Therefore, their external dimensions have also been stated. The external dimension of the *ghanodadhi* is twenty thousand yojanas. The external dimension of the *ghanavaat* is countless thousands of yojanas. The external dimension of the *tanuvaat* and the *aakash* is also countless thousands of yojanas each. The external dimensions of the *ghanodadhi* etc. of all the earths are the same.

**The Existence of Substances in the Ratnaprabha etc.** **[73]** **Thus, Lord!** In the Ratnaprabha earth, which is eighty thousand yojanas thick, are there substances like black, blue, red, yellow, white, fragrant, odorous, foul-smelling, sweet, bitter, astringent, sour, salty, hard, soft, heavy, light, cold, hot, dry, wet, round, square, triangular, rectangular, and other shapes, which are bound together, which are interlocked, which are dense, which are bound together by mutual attraction, and which are in mutual contact? **Yes, there are.**

## Third Chapter: The Existence of Substances in Ratnaprabha etc.

[205 Yes, Gautama! Similarly, in the Apbahul Kand, which is eighty thousand yojanas in extent, there are also substances with prior specific characteristics. Bhagavan! Are there substances with prior specific characteristics in the Ghanodadhi of this Ratnaprabha earth, which is twenty thousand yojanas in extent and divided by intellect? Yes, Gautama! There are. Similarly, there are substances in the Ghanavat and Tanuvat, which are countless thousands of yojanas in extent, and in the Akasha as well. O Bhagavan! Are the substances in the Sharkaraprabha earth, which is one lakh thirty-two thousand yojanas in extent and divided by intellect into Prataradi forms, mutually connected with prior specific characteristics? Yes, Gautama! There are. Similarly, one should understand the same in the Ghanodadhi, which is twenty thousand yojanas in extent, and in the Ghanavat and Akasha, which are countless thousands of yojanas in extent. Like Sharkaraprabha, one should understand the statement in the same order up to the seventh earth.

**Discussion:** In the present sutra, the existence of substances in all seven Naraka earths, in the three Kands of Ratnaprabha earth, in the Ghanodhadhis, Ghanavats, Tanuvats, and in the spaces between them has been stated. Everywhere, the existence of substances transformed into various Paryayas in relation to color, smell, taste, touch, and form has been described.

**The order of questions and answers is as follows:**

First, the existence of substances in Ratnaprabha earth has been stated. Then, in order, from Kharkand, Ratnakanad to Rishtkand, Punkbahulkand, Apbahulkand, Ghanodadhi, Dhanavat, Tanuvat, and in the spaces between them, the existence of substances has been stated. After that, the existence of substances in Sharkaraprabha earth, in its Ghanodadhi-Dhanavat-Tanuvat and in the spaces between them has been described. Like Sharkaraprabha earth, the statement of all seven earths has been made.

The meaning of the words "AnnamAnnabadhai" etc. used in the sutra is as follows:

**AnnamAnnabadhai:** Mutually connected.
**AnnamAnnaputai:** Touching each other.
**AnnamAnnaogadhai:** Where one substance exists, there also other substances exist in the same space or in the whole.
**AnnamAnasinehapdibadhai:** Mutually connected due to the quality of affection, so that when one moves, the other also moves, and when one is grasped, the other is also grasped.
**AnnamNaghadatae Chitthati:** Mixed together deeply like milk and water, or united.

## 208] Gautama, the *Jobajovaabhigamsutra* states that there are three types of *valayas* (rings): *Ghano-udadhi-valaya*, *Dhana-vat-valaya*, and *Tanu-vat-valaya*.  O Bhagavan, how many types of *charamanta* (extremities) are there in the southern direction of the *Ratna-prabha* earth? Gautama, there are three types of *charamanta*, namely *Ghano-udadhi-valaya*, *Dhana-vat-valaya*, and *Tanu-vat-valaya*.  Similarly, one should describe the *charamanta* of the northern direction.  Similarly, one should describe the types of *charamanta* in all directions up to the northern *charamanta* of all the seven earths.

**Discussion:** This *sutra* explains how far the *aloka* (light) is from the *charamanta* of the hellish earths.  The *aloka* is twelve *yojanas* away from the *charamanta* of the eastern direction of the *Ratna-prabha* earth.  In other words, there is a distance of twelve *yojanas* between the *charamanta* of the eastern direction of the *Ratna-prabha* earth and the *aloka*.  Similarly, the *aloka* is twelve *yojanas* away from the *charamanta* of the south, west, and north directions of the *Ratna-prabha* earth.  Here, the direction is a sign, therefore, the *aloka* is twelve *yojanas* away from the *charamanta* of all four directions, and there is a distance between them.  The *aloka* is thirteen *yojanas* minus one-third from the *charamanta* of all directions and sub-directions of the *Sharkara-prabha* earth.  In other words, there is such a distance between the *charamanta* and the *aloka*.  The *aloka* is thirteen *yojanas* (complete thirteen *yojanas*) including the aforementioned one-third from the *charamanta* of all directions and sub-directions of the *Baluka-prabha* earth.  There is such a distance between them.  There is a distance of fourteen *yojanas* between the *Pank-prabha* and the *aloka*.  There is a distance of fifteen *yojanas* minus one-third between the *Dhuma-prabha* and the *aloka*.  There is a distance of fifteen *yojanas* including the aforementioned one-third between the *Tama-prabha* and the *aloka*.  There is a distance of sixteen *yojanas* between the *charamanta* of the seventh earth from below and the *aloka*.  After explaining this distance, the question is asked whether these distances are in the form of space or whether *Ghano-udadhi* etc. are present in them?  The answer is that these distances are filled with *Ghano-udadhi*, *Ghanavat*, and *Tanuvat*.  Here, these *Ghano-udadhi* etc. are ring-shaped, therefore, they are called *Ghano-udadhi-valaya*, *Dhana-vat-valaya*, and *Tanu-vat-valaya*.  The outer extent of *Ghano-udadhi* etc. mentioned earlier below all the hellish earths is of their middle part.  After that, due to the loss of area, they become thinner and thinner, reaching their respective earths, and remain encircling their respective earths in a ring-shaped manner, therefore, they are called *valayas*.  The height of these *valayas* is the same everywhere according to their respective earths.  The horizontal outer extent will be explained later.  Here, only the division of distances is explained.  The horizontal outer extent of the *Ghano-udadhi-valaya* is 76.

**(1)** O Bhagavan, what is the outer extent of the *Ghano-udadhi-valaya* of the *Ratna-prabha* earth? Gautama, it is six *yojanas*.  What is the outer extent of the *Ghano-udadhi-valaya* of the *Sharkara-prabha* earth?

## Third Transmigration: The Outermost Layer of the Dense Water Ring

[211] The [dense water ring] of the [earth of the Jewel-Light] is surrounded by [the earth of the Jewel-Light] on all sides, and so on until the [dense water ring] of the lowest [earth]. The [earth of the Jewel-Light] is surrounded by [the earth of the Jewel-Light] on all sides, and so on until the lowest [earth].

**Question:** Venerable Sir, what is the shape of the [dense water ring] of the [earth of the Jewel-Light]?

**Answer:** Gautama, it is like a ring, just as the [dense water ring] of the [earth of the Jewel-Light] is surrounded by [the earth of the Jewel-Light] on all sides, and so on until the lowest [dense water ring].

**Question:** Venerable Sir, what is the shape of the [thin water ring] of the [earth of the Jewel-Light]?

**Answer:** Gautama, it is like a ring, just as the [dense water ring] of the [earth of the Jewel-Light] is surrounded by [the earth of the Jewel-Light] on all sides, and so on until the lowest [thin water ring].

**Question:** Venerable Sir, what is the size of the [earth of the Jewel-Light]?

**Answer:** Gautama, it is said to be countless yojanas in diameter and countless yojanas in circumference, and so on until the lowest [earth].

**Question:** Venerable Sir, is the [earth of the Jewel-Light] the same in size at the center and at the edges?

**Answer:** Gautama, yes, the [earth of the Jewel-Light] is the same in size at the center and at the edges, and so on until the lowest [earth].

[76-2] **Question:** Venerable Sir, are there substances like black, etc., in the [dense water ring] of the [earth of the Jewel-Light], which is six yojanas in outer layer and has divisions like [pratra, etc.], as conceived by the mind?

**Answer:** Gautama, yes, there are.

**Question:** Venerable Sir, are there substances like black, etc., in the [dense water ring] of the [earth of the Sugar-Light], which is six yojanas in outer layer and has divisions like [pratra, etc.], as conceived by the mind, including the three parts?

**Answer:** Gautama, yes, there are.

And so on, one should say the same for the [dense water ring] of the seventh [earth], adding the appropriate adjective for the outer layer.

**Question:** Venerable Sir, are there substances like black, etc., in the [dense water ring] of the [earth of the Jewel-Light], which is four and a half yojanas in outer layer and has divisions like [pratra, etc.], as conceived by the mind?

**Answer:** Gautama, yes, there are.

And so on, one should say the same for the seventh [earth], adding the appropriate adjective for the outer layer.

Similarly, one should say the same for the [thin water ring] of the seventh [earth], adding the appropriate adjective for the outer layer.

**Question:** Venerable Sir, what is the shape of the [dense water ring] of the [earth of the Jewel-Light]?

**Answer:** Gautama, it is said to be round and ring-shaped, because it surrounds the [earth of the Jewel-Light] on all sides.

Similarly, one should understand the shape of the [dense water ring] of all seven [earths]. The special feature is that they all surround their respective [earths].

212]  O Bhagavan! What is the shape of the *Dhanavatavala* of this Ratnapraba earth? Gautama! It is said to be circular and ring-shaped, because it surrounds the *Ghanodadhivala* of this Ratnapraba earth on all sides. In the same way, one should know the shape of the *Dhanavatavala* of all seven earths. O Bhagavan! What is the shape of the *Tanuvatavala* of this Ratnapraba earth? Gautama! It is said to be circular and ring-shaped, because it surrounds the *Dhanavatavala* on all sides. In the same way, one should know the shape of the *Tanuvatavala* up to the seventh earth. O Bhagavan! How long and wide is this Ratnapraba earth said to be? Gautama! It is said to be countless thousands of yojanas long and wide, and has a circumference (girth) of countless thousands of yojanas. In the same way, one should say it up to the seventh earth. O Bhagavan! Is this Ratnapraba earth said to have the same thickness at the end and in the middle, everywhere? Yes, Gautama! This Ratnapraba earth is said to have the same thickness at the end, in the middle, everywhere. In the same way, one should say it up to the seventh earth. 

The production of all living beings and *pudgalas* 77. O Bhagavan! Are all living beings born in this Ratnapraba earth, or are some not born? Gautama! All living beings are born in this Ratnapraba earth, and none are not born. And so it is up to the *Adhesattama* earth. O Bhagavan! Are all living beings born in this Ratnapraba earth, or are some not born? Gautama! All living beings are born in this Ratnapraba earth, and none are not born. And so it is up to the *Adhesattama* earth. O Bhagavan! Are all *pudgalas* born in this Ratnapraba earth, or are some not born? Gautama! All *pudgalas* are born in this Ratnapraba earth, and none are not born. And so it is up to the *Adhesattama* earth. O Bhagavan! Are all *pudgalas* born in this Ratnapraba earth, or are some not born? Gautama! All *pudgalas* are born in this Ratnapraba earth, and none are not born. And so it is up to the *Adhesattama* earth.

## Third Chapter: The Production of All Living Beings and Pudgalas [213 [77]

**O Bhagavan!** Have all living beings in this Ratnapraba earth been produced from the beginning of time, or have they been produced simultaneously?

**Gautam!** In this Ratnapraba earth, all living beings have been produced from the beginning of time, but not all living beings have been produced simultaneously in Ratnapraba. Similarly, the question and answer should be stated up to the seventh earth.

**O Bhagavan!** Has this Ratnapraba earth been abandoned by all living beings in the past, or has it been abandoned by all living beings simultaneously in the past?

**Gautam!** This Ratnapraba earth has been abandoned by all living beings in the past, but not all living beings have abandoned it simultaneously in the past. Similarly, the question and answer should be stated up to the seventh earth.

**O Bhagavan!** Have all Pudgalas entered this Ratnapraba earth from the beginning of time, or have all Pudgalas entered it simultaneously in the past?

**Gautam!** In this Ratnapraba earth, all Pudgalas have entered from the beginning of time, but not all Pudgalas have entered it simultaneously in the past. Similarly, the question and answer should be stated up to the seventh earth.

**O Bhagavan!** Has this Ratnapraba earth been abandoned by all Pudgalas in the past, or have all Pudgalas abandoned it simultaneously in the past?

**Gautam!** This Ratnapraba earth has been abandoned by all Pudgalas in the past, but not all Pudgalas have abandoned it simultaneously in the past. Similarly, the question and answer should be stated up to the seventh earth.

**Discussion:**

The present Sutra asks whether all living beings and all Pudgalas in the world have undergone movement and transformation in Ratnapraba and other earths. The meaning of the question is whether all living beings have been produced in Ratnapraba and other earths from the beginning of time, or have all living beings been produced simultaneously? Similarly, the question should be understood in relation to Pudgalas, regarding their transformation in Ratnapraba and other earths from the beginning of time or simultaneously.

**Bhagavan said:** Gautam! In this Ratnapraba earth, all living beings have been produced from the beginning of time, at different times. Here, by all living beings, only those living beings with a transactional mass should be understood, not those without a transactional mass. Since the world is eternal, all living beings have been produced in Ratnapraba and other earths at different times. But not all living beings have been produced simultaneously in Ratnapraba and other earths. If all living beings were to be produced simultaneously in Ratnapraba and other earths, then there would be a lack of Devas, Tiryanchas, Manushayas, etc. This never happens. The nature of the world is such. Due to the nature of the world, the four states of existence are eternal. Therefore, all living beings cannot be produced simultaneously in Ratnapraba and other earths. 

Page #258:
---------------------------
[214] The first question regarding the Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra is about the origin. The second question is about the exit, "O Bhagavan! Did all beings leave the Ratnaprabaha and other earths in the past in a chronological order, or did all beings leave the Ratnaprabaha and other earths together in the past?" Bhagavan said, "Gautam! All beings left the Ratnaprabaha and other lands in the past in a chronological order, at different times, but all beings did not leave them together. All beings cannot abandon the Ratnaprabaha and other lands together. Because such a cause does not exist. If it is assumed that all beings abandoned the Ratnaprabaha and other lands together, then the influence of Narakas would be in the Ratnaprabaha and other lands. This never happens. After the questions and answers regarding the Jivas, there are questions related to Pudgalas. Did all Pudgalas become Ratnaprabaha and other forms in the past in a chronological order, or did all Pudgalas become Ratnaprabaha and other forms together? Bhagavan said, "All Pudgalas became Ratnaprabaha and other forms in a chronological order, at different times, because the world is eternal and such a transformation can happen. But all Pudgalas cannot become Ratnaprabaha and other forms together. If all Pudgalas become of that form, then there will be a lack of Pudgalas everywhere else except the Ratnaprabaha and other lands. This never happens due to the nature of the world. Similarly, all Pudgalas have abandoned the transformation of the Ratnaprabaha and other forms in a chronological order. Because the world is eternal, but all Pudgalas have not abandoned the transformation of the Ratnaprabaha and other forms together. Because if it is assumed so, then the influence of the form of the Ratnaprabaha and other lands will be there. This cannot happen. Because the Ratnaprabaha and other lands are eternal due to the nature of the world. Eternal or non-eternal 78. "O Bhagavan! Is this Ratnaprabaha earth eternal or non-eternal?" Gautam! It is eternal in some ways and non-eternal in some ways. "O Bhagavan! Why is it said that it is eternal in some ways and non-eternal in some ways?" Gautam! It is eternal in terms of its substance, but non-eternal in terms of its color, smell, taste, and touch. Therefore, Gautam! It is said that it is non-eternal in some ways. It is also non-eternal in terms of its middle state. "O Bhagavan! What is the time period of this Ratnaprabaha earth?" Gautam! It has never been, it is not now, and it will never be. It is eternal, permanent, stable, imperishable, continuous, and infinite. It is also non-eternal in terms of its middle state. [78] 

Page #259:
---------------------------
[215 Third Proposition: Eternal and Non-Eternal] Gautama! From the perspective of Dravyathikana, it is eternal, and from the perspective of Varna-Paryayas, Gandha-Paryayas, Rasa-Paryayas, and Sparsha-Paryayas, it is non-eternal. Therefore, Gautama! It is said that this Ratnaprabha-Prithvi is in some ways eternal and in some ways non-eternal.  /  Similarly, one should say the same for the seven lower Prithvis.  Bhagavan! For how long will this Ratnaprabha-Prithvi remain? Gautama! This Ratnaprabha-Prithvi was never 'not', it is never 'not', and it will never be 'not'. It was in the past, it is in the present, and it will be in the future. It is Dhruva, Nitya, Shashvat, Akshaya, Avyaya, Avashtita, and Nitya. Similarly, one should know the same for the seven lower Prithvis.

In the presented Sutra, Ratnaprabha-Prithvi is called both eternal and non-eternal. This raises a doubt: how can two contradictory qualities exist in the same thing if eternality and non-eternality are contradictory? If it is eternal, it cannot be non-eternal, and if it is non-eternal, it cannot be eternal.  /  Just as coldness and heat cannot coexist.  /  Monistic philosophies hold such a belief.  /  Therefore, Nitya-Ekantvadis deny non-eternality, and Anitya-Ekantvadis deny eternality.  Samkhya and other philosophies support the concept of eternal monism, while Buddhism and other philosophies support the concept of momentary-non-eternal monism. Jainism rejects both these monisms and supports Anekanta. Jain Agamas and Janadarshan view every object from various perspectives, accepting its diverse and unified nature. Objects have different forms due to different interpretations and perspectives, and within that diversity, their unity remains. Monistic philosophies consider only one quality as the whole object. However, in reality, objects have different forms from various perspectives.  /  Therefore, monism is incomplete and one-sided. It does not reveal the complete and true nature of the object. Jainism views the object holistically and states that every object is both eternal and non-eternal, general and specific, unified and diverse, different and non-different, depending on the perspective.  /  By accepting this, the accusation of contradictory qualities by monistic philosophies is not true. Because the contradiction arises only when something is called eternal, non-eternal, etc., from the same perspective or interpretation.  /  There is no fault or inconsistency when considering it from different perspectives or interpretations. For example, the same person is a father, son, maternal uncle, paternal uncle, etc., depending on the relationship.  /  What is the contradiction here? This is an experienced and practical fact.  _Jainism proves its Anekanta perspective based on Nayas. In short, there are two types of Nayas: 1. Dravyathikana and 2. Paryayathikana.  /  Dravyanaya considers the general nature of the object, and Paryayanaya considers the specific nature of the object.  /  Every object is Dravya-Paryayatmak. '1. Utpadavyayadhrauvyamuktam Sat  /  -Tattvarth Sutra Dravya-Paryayatmakam Vastu  /    

Page #260:
---------------------------
[216] The essence of the *jiva-jiva-abhigamsutra* is neither solely a substance nor solely a mode. It is both. Modes cannot exist without substance, and substance cannot exist without modes. Substance is the basis of modes, and modes are the dependent of substance. Without the dependent, there is no basis, and without the basis, there is no dependent. Modes cannot exist without substance, and substance cannot exist without modes. Therefore, it can be said that the hypothetically conceived solitary substance is false because it is devoid of modes. That which is devoid of modes is a false substance, like a barren son who is devoid of the modes of childhood, etc. Similarly, it can be said that the hypothetically conceived solitary mode is false because it is different from substance. That which is different from substance is false, like the modes of childhood, etc., of a barren son. Therefore, it is proven that the essence is both substance and mode, and it should be considered holistically from both perspectives. Taking into account this *anekantavadi* and proven perspective, the sutra states that the *ratnaprabha* earth is eternal in relation to substance. That is, the form, existence, etc., of the *ratnaprabha* earth has always been, is, and will always be. Therefore, it is eternal. However, its modes of color, such as black, etc., its modes of smell, etc., its modes of taste, its modes of touch, etc., change every moment, therefore it is also non-eternal. Thus, from the perspective of the *dravya-athikanaya*, the *ratnaprabha* earth is eternal, and from the perspective of the *paryaya-athikanaya*, it is non-eternal. Similarly, one should understand the statement about the seven hellish earths. When the eternality of the *ratnaprabha*, etc., is stated in relation to substance, there may be a doubt whether this eternality is in the form of existence throughout all time or in the form of existence for a long time, as the other *tirthankaras* say - is this earth eternally existent for a kalpa? This doubt is resolved by stating that this earth has always been, is, and will always be from beginningless time. It is beginningless and endless. Being present in all three times, it is firm, being of a fixed nature, it is fixed like a *dharma-stikaya*, being fixed, it is eternal, because it does not perish. Being eternal, it is imperishable, being imperishable, it is immutable, and being immutable, it is present in its own proof. Therefore, it is eternal due to its constant existence. Alternatively, the words *dhruva*, etc., can be understood as synonymous. Various synonymous words have been used to emphasize eternality. Similarly, one should understand the eternality of the seven earths. 

The division of the *pravis* 79. "Thus, *bante*, what is the distance between the *charimanta* who are above the *ratnaprabha* earth and the *charimanta* who are below it?" "Go *yama*, they are separated by a distance of one hundred thousand *yojanas*." "Thus, *bante*, what is the distance between the *charimanta* who are above the *ratnaprabha* earth and the *charimanta* who are below the *kharas* *kanda*?" "Go *yama*, they are separated by a distance of sixteen thousand *yojanas*."

[218] Movanivaabhigamsutra [79] Bhagavan! What is the distance between the upper and lower limits of this Ratnapraba earth? Gautama! The distance is one lakh eighty thousand yojanas. Bhagavan! What is the distance between the upper limit of this Ratnapraba earth and the lower limit of Kharkaanda? Gautama! The distance is sixteen thousand yojanas. Bhagavan! What is the distance between the upper limit of this Ratnapraba earth and the lower limit of Ratnakanda? Gautama! The distance is one thousand yojanas. Bhagavan! What is the distance between the upper limit of this Ratnapraba earth and the upper limit of Vajrakanda? Gautama! The distance is one thousand yojanas. Bhagavan! What is the distance between the upper limit of this Ratnapraba earth and the lower limit of Vajrakanda? Gautama! The distance is two thousand yojanas. Thus, the distance between the upper limit of Rishtkanda is fifteen thousand yojanas and the distance to the lower limit is sixteen thousand yojanas. Bhagavan! What is the distance between the upper limit of this Ratnapraba earth and the upper limit of Pankabahulkaanda? Gautama! The distance is sixteen thousand yojanas. The distance to the lower limit is one lakh yojanas. The distance to the upper limit of Apbahulkaanda is one lakh yojanas and the distance to the lower limit is one lakh eighty thousand yojanas. The distance to the upper limit of Ghanodadhi is one lakh eighty thousand yojanas and the distance to the lower limit is two lakh yojanas. The distance between the upper limit of this Ratnapraba earth and the upper limit of Dhanavat is two lakh yojanas and the distance to the lower limit is countless lakh yojanas. The distance between the upper limit of this Ratnapraba earth and the upper limit of Tanuvat is countless lakh yojanas and the distance to the lower limit is also countless lakh yojanas. Similarly, one should understand the distance between the two limits of Aavakaashantara. Bhagavan! What is the distance between the upper and lower limits of the second earth (Sharkara prabha)? Gautama! The distance is one lakh thirty-two thousand yojanas. The distance between the upper limit of Dhanodadhi is one lakh thirty-two thousand yojanas. The distance to the lower limit is one lakh fifty-two thousand yojanas.

## Third Understanding: Equality etc. in Relation to Thickness [219]

There is a difference between the upper limit of the Dhanavat and the lower limit of the Dhanavat. There is also a difference of countless lakhs of yojanas between the lower limit of the Dhanavat and the upper and lower limits of the Tanuvat and the Avashaantar. In this way, it should be said up to the seventh earth. 

**The special feature is that the relationship of the Ghanodadhi should be connected with the intellect in relation to the thickness of the earth.** For example, there is a difference of one lakh eighty-eight thousand yojanas between the upper limit of the third earth and the limit of the Ghanodadhi. 

There is a difference of one lakh forty-four thousand yojanas between the upper limit of the Pankaprabha earth and the limit of its Ghanodadhi. There is a difference of one lakh thirty-six thousand yojanas between the upper limit of the Ghumpabha and the limit of its Ghanodadhi. There is a difference of one lakh thirty-six thousand yojanas in the Tamahprabha and a difference of one lakh twenty-eight thousand yojanas between the upper limit of the Adhasaptamah earth and the limit of its Ghanodadhi. 

Similarly, in the inquiry of the lower limit of the Dhanavat, in the inquiry of the upper and lower limits of the Tanuvat and the Avashaantar, it should be said that there is a difference of countless lakhs of yojanas. 

**Equality etc. in relation to thickness 80.**

"O Bhagavan! Is this Ratnapraba earth equal, superior, or countable in thickness compared to the second hell earth? And in terms of expanse, is it equal, inferior, or uncountable?"

"Gautama! This Ratnapraba earth is not equal, is superior, and is uncountable in thickness compared to the second hell earth. In terms of expanse, it is not equal, is inferior, and is not uncountable."

"O Bhagavan! Is the second hell earth equal in thickness compared to the third hell earth?" And so on, it should be said in the same way. 

Similarly, it should be understood in the case of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth hell earths. 

"O Bhagavan! Is the sixth hell earth equal, superior, or countable in thickness compared to the seventh hell earth?" It should be said in the same way. 

"So be it, Bhagavan! So be it, Bhagavan! This is the first Neraiyauddesa." [80]

---------------------------
## 220 [Jivajivaabhigamsutra, O Bhagavan! (As you said) it is so, it is so / Thus, the first Nairyika Uddeshaka is complete. 

**Discussion:** This Sutra raises questions regarding the relative equality, superiority, or inferiority, or the numerical superiority or inferiority, in terms of the external size and extent of the Naraka-Prithvis. 

**Doubt:** It may be doubted that since the external size of the Naraka-Prithvis has been explained in the previous Sutras, this information is already known, so what is the use of these questions? This doubt is valid, but the solution is that these questions are asked to dispel the ignorance of others who are slow-witted, even though the speaker already knows the answers. 

**Types of Questions:** There are two types of questions - one is a Gya-Prashna (question for knowledge) and the other is an Agnya-Prashna (question for ignorance). A question asked with the intention of explaining to others, even though the speaker already knows the answer, is a Gya-Prashna. A question asked out of one's own curiosity is an Agnya-Prashna. 

**The Question:** The question asked above is a Gya-Prashna, asked for the benefit of the slow-witted. How can we say it is a Gya-Prashna? Because the question that follows is for self-realization. 

**The Question and Answer:** The Sutra asks whether the Ratnaprabha-Prithvi is equal in thickness, superior, or numerically superior to the other Naraka-Prithvis. The answer is that it is not equal, it is superior, but not numerically superior. This is because the thickness of Ratnaprabha is one lakh eighty thousand yojanas, and the thickness of the other Sharkara-Prithvi is one lakh thirty-two thousand yojanas. There is a difference of forty-eight thousand yojanas between the two. 

**Explanation:** Due to this difference, only superiority occurs, not equality or numerical superiority. We will list the thickness of all the Prithvis here so that it becomes clear that the first Prithvi is superior in external size to the second, the second is superior to the third, the third is superior to the fourth, and so on, until the sixth Prithvi is superior in thickness to the seventh. 

**Thickness of the Prithvis:** The thickness of the first Prithvi is one lakh eighty thousand yojanas. The thickness of the second Prithvi is one lakh thirty-two thousand yojanas. The thickness of the third Prithvi is one lakh twenty-eight thousand yojanas. The thickness of the fourth Prithvi is one lakh twenty thousand yojanas. The thickness of the fifth Prithvi is one lakh eighteen thousand yojanas. The thickness of the sixth Prithvi is one lakh sixteen thousand yojanas. The thickness of the seventh Prithvi is one lakh eight thousand yojanas. 

**Conclusion:** Therefore, in terms of external size, each preceding Prithvi is superior to its preceding Prithvi, not equal or numerically superior. In terms of extent, each preceding Prithvi is inferior to its preceding Prithvi, not equal or numerically inferior. As the area of the Ratnaprabha increases due to the growth of the Pradesh, etc., the area of the Sharkaraprabha, etc., also increases proportionally. Therefore, only inferiority occurs.

## Third Chapter: Equality etc. in Relation to Externals] ]221 Thus, upon being answered by the Lord, Shri Gautam Swami Bhagwan expresses his unwavering and unparalleled devotion towards the Lord, saying, "O Bhagwan! What you have said is completely true, real, and authentic." Saying this, Gautam Swami Bhagwan bows down to the Lord, and while practicing restraint and austerity, he continues to wander. / Thus ends the first marker-objective of the third chapter of the Jiva-Jiva-Abhigam. / 00

The third section of the second chapter of the first chapter provides information about the names, gotras, external characteristics, and other details of the hells and earths. Now, in the second chapter, which is in sequential order, a description is being given about which region of the hells and earths has how many hell-dwellers and what they are like, etc. Its initial sutra is this: 81. "O Bhagavan! How many earths have been stated?" "Gautama! Seven earths have been stated, such as Ratnaprabha up to Adhasaptamapṛthvī." "O Bhagavan! In this Ratnaprabha earth, which has a circumference of one hundred and eighty thousand yojanas, how far above and how much below, and in the middle, how many lakhs of hell-dwellers have been stated?" "Gautama! In this Ratnaprabha earth, which has a circumference of one hundred and eighty thousand yojanas, leaving one thousand yojanas above and one thousand yojanas below, in the middle, in a region of one hundred and seventy-eight thousand yojanas, there are thirty lakhs of hell-dwellers, it has been said." "These hell-dwellers are round inside and square outside, up to the point where they have unpleasant sensations in these hells." "In this way, according to this aspiration, one should speak according to the place and the path of knowledge, wherever there is a circumference and wherever there are hell-dwellers, adding them as adjectives, up to the seventh earth, such as in the middle of the Adhasaptamapṛthvī, how many regions have how many Anuttar, the greatest of the great Mahānarakas, been stated? One should ask this question and answer it in the same way." 

Page #267:
---------------------------
## Third Chapter: Second Objective [223 Discussion - How many Earths are there?]

This question has been asked before and answered previously, stating that there are seven Earths - from Ratnaprabha to the seventh Earth downwards. Why is it being asked again? This doubt is natural. 

To resolve this, the ancient teachers have said, "Whatever is said previously is repeated for a specific reason. That specific reason could be prohibition or permission, or it could be to highlight a specific aspect of the previous topic." This repeated question should be understood as an attempt to provide more and specific information about the previously mentioned topic.

Here, the specific question is: Where are the hells located within the hell-earths? What is the nature of these hells? And what kind of suffering do the hell beings experience there?

In response to these questions, the Lord has said that within the Ratnaprabha Earth, which is one lakh eighty thousand yojanas thick, there are thirty lakh hells located in the middle region, starting one thousand yojanas above the upper part and leaving one thousand yojanas of the lower part. This statement, as I am making it, has also been made by the Tirthankaras of the past. There is no contradiction and uniformity in the words of all Tirthankaras.

These hells are round in the middle and square on the outside. The round shape is mentioned with respect to the middle part, which is the back. However, with respect to the entire back and other parts, the hells that are entered through the entrance are said to be triangular and square in shape. The Pushpavakirna hells are of many types. The phrase "Jāv asubhā" in the sutra refers to the text given in the commentary, which means "Ahekh rappasanthāṇa". These hells are sharp like a razor from the bottom. This means that the ground of these hells is not smooth or soft, but is filled with pebbles, which cut and tear the feet of the hell beings upon contact, causing them pain.

"Picchanshārtamasā" - In these hells, there is always dense darkness. Except for the births and other events of the Tirthankaras, there is a complete absence of light. The darkness there is always dense, like that of a blind person or the darkness of a moonless night, because there are no suns or other sources of light.

To make this even clearer, the following specific details are given: "Bavagayagahchandasuranakkhaṭṭajoisapha" - In these hells, there is no path for the planets, moon, sun, stars, and other celestial bodies. In other words, these sources of light are not present there.

1. "Punvabhaniyaṁ pi jaṁ puṇ bhaṇṇai tattha kāraṇamasthi / Paḍiseho ya aṇuṇṇā kāraṇa viśesovalambho vā //"
2. "Ahe khurappasanthāṇasanthiya, nicchandhārtamasā, bavagayagah-chand-sūr-makkhattajōisapha, meyavasāpūyaruhirmaṁsachī vikhallalittāṇulevaṇatala, asuhbībhaccha, paramadubbigandha kāūpragaṇivaṇṇābhā kakkhaḍaphāsā durahiyāsā asuhā naraesā viyaṇā /" 

Page #268:
---------------------------
[224] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra] The ground of the hellish realms is stained with the mud of fat, grease, pus, blood, and flesh, repeatedly smeared. [Asuibibbachha] Due to the mud of fat, etc., they are extremely repulsive and disgusting. [Parmaduhbhigandha] These hellish realms are extremely foul-smelling. They emit a stench like that of dead animal carcasses. [Kauvaganivannabha] Just as the flame of fire turns very black when iron is heated, so are these hellish realms of that color. [Kakhkadfasa] The touch of these hellish realms is extremely rough. Like the edge of a sword, the touch there is unbearable. [Durahiasa] These hellish realms are so painful that it is very difficult to endure their suffering. [Asuabhaveyana] These hellish realms are very inauspicious! Their inauspiciousness is evident just by looking at them. The color, smell, taste, touch, and sound there are all inauspicious. And the suffering that the beings experience there is also extremely unbearable, hence the epithet "Asuabhaveyana". There are three types of unbearable suffering in the hellish realms. 

The statement made regarding the Ratnapraba earth applies to the Sharkarapraba earth as well. Only the thickness of the Sharkarapraba earth and the number of its hellish realms should be added as a qualifier. For example, the text related to the Sharkarapraba earth would be as follows: "Sakkarappamae nam bhantae! Pudhaviye battisuttar-joyanasayasahassabahllaae uri kevaiyam ogaahitta hettha kevaiyam vajjetta majjhe chev kevaie kevaiya nirayaavassayasahassa pannatta? Goyama! Sakkarappabhaae battisuttar-joyanasayasahassabahllaae uri ega joyanasahassam ogaahitta heva ega joyanasahassam vajjetta majjhe tisuttar joyanasayasahasse, ettha nam sakkarappabhaae pudhavineraiyaanam panavisa narayaavassayasaya sahassa bhavanti ti makkaay, te nam naraga anto vattha jaav asubhanaraesu veyana /" 

Similarly, the text for Balukapraba, Pankapraba, Dhumapraba, and Tamahpraba, and the seventh earth below should be stated. The thickness of all the earths and the number of hellish realms should be known from the following bracket: 1. The following Sangahani gathas are useful in this regard: 

Paasiyam battisam atthavisaam tahev visaam cha / Attharasa solagam atthattaramaev hitthimaya // 1 // 
Atthattaram cha tisam chhanvisaam chev sayasahassam tu / Attharasa solagam choisamaahiyam tu chhattie // 2 // 
Addhativannasahassa uvarimhae vajjiuun bhaniya. Majjhe tisusahasse su honti niraya tamtamaae // 3 // 
Tisa ya pannavisa pannavrasa dasa chev sayasahassaai / Tinnni ya panchanaga pancheva anattara niraya // 4 //

[226] There are some like the *jivajivaabhigamsutra* drum, some like the *bheri* (a type of drum), some like the *jhallari* (a type of cymbal), some like the *kustumbaka* (a type of musical instrument), and some like the *naadi ghatika* (a type of timekeeping device). In this way, one should say up to the sixth hell, the earth.  O Bhagavan! How is the institution of the hells of the seventh earth?  Gautama: They are of two types: circular and triangular. [2]  O Bhagavan! How thick are the hells of the *ratnaprabha* earth?  Gautama: They are three thousand yojanas thick.  They are dense for one thousand yojanas below, hollow for one thousand yojanas in the middle, and compressed for one thousand yojanas above.  In this way, one should say up to the seventh earth.  O Bhagavan! How long, wide, and circumferenced are the hells of the *ratnaprabha* earth?  Gautama: They are of two types: those with a countable number of yojanas in their expanse and those with an uncountable number of yojanas in their expanse.  Those with a countable number of yojanas in their expanse have a length and width of a countable number of thousands of yojanas and a circumference of a countable number of thousands of yojanas.  Those with an uncountable number of yojanas in their expanse have a length and width of an uncountable number of thousands of yojanas and a circumference of an uncountable number of thousands of yojanas.  In this way, one should say up to the sixth earth.  O Bhagavan! How about the seventh earth?  Gautama: They are of two types: those with a countable number of yojanas in their expanse and those with an uncountable number of yojanas in their expanse.  Those with a countable number of yojanas in their expanse have a length and width of one thousand yojanas and a circumference of three thousand yojanas, sixteen thousand two hundred and twenty-seven yojanas, three *kosa*, twenty-eight *dhanus* (bows), thirteen *angula* (fingers), half an *angula*, and a little bit more.

## Third Chapter: Description of the Hells

**227. O Bhagavan! What is the diameter and circumference of the hells on the seventh hell-earth?**

**Gautama:** The hells on the seventh earth are of two types: (1) those with a diameter of a thousand yojanas, and (2) those with an immeasurable number of thousand yojanas. The ones with a diameter of a thousand yojanas have a diameter of one hundred thousand yojanas, and their circumference is three hundred sixteen thousand two hundred twenty-seven yojanas, three kosas, one hundred twenty-eight dhanus, and slightly more than thirteen and a half angulas. The ones with an immeasurable number of thousand yojanas have a diameter of an immeasurable number of thousand yojanas, and their circumference is also an immeasurable number of thousand yojanas.

**Discussion:** This sutra describes the structure, diameter, and circumference of the hells. There are two types of hells: **pavalikapravisht** and **avalikabahya**. Those that are arranged in a series in all eight directions are called **avalikapravisht**. They are of three types: circular, triangular, and square. Those that are scattered like flowers are of various types. These various types are described in two collections of verses.

There are hells shaped like an iron chest, a vessel for cooking dough to make liquor, a baker's oven, a griddle, a frying pan, a **sthali** (large pot), a **pitharak** (large vessel), a hermit's ashram, a **murj**, a **nandīmṛdanga**, a **praling** earthen drum, a **sughosha**, a **daddar** (a type of musical instrument), a **panav** (a drum made of vessels), a **patha** (a general drum), a **jhalar**, a **bheri**, a **kustumbak** (a type of musical instrument), and a **nadi** (a timepiece). The **mṛdanga** is narrow at the top and wide at the bottom, while the **murj** is even at both the top and bottom.

This description should be understood for the hell-earths from **Ratnaprabha** to **Tamaprabha**. The hells on the seventh earth are only **avalikapravisht**, not **pavalikabahya**. These **avalikapravisht** hells are five in number: four in the four directions and one in the middle. The central hell is round, and the remaining four are triangular. The **Ratnaprabha** hell has an outer diameter of three thousand yojanas. The lower part of one thousand yojanas is cubic, the middle part of one thousand yojanas is **jhushira**, and the upper part of one thousand yojanas is narrow. Similarly, the outer diameter of the hells on all seven earths is the same. The diameter and circumference are clear from the original text.

**83. O Bhagavan! What is the color of the hells on the **Ratnaprabha** earth?**

**Gautama:** The color of the hells on the **Ratnaprabha** earth is black, dark, deep, dark brown, fierce, and extremely dark. This is the same for all the hells up to the seventh.

**1. What are the shapes of the hells?**

They are shaped like a **pitupayanag** (a type of vessel), a **kandulohi** (a type of vessel), a **kadah** (a type of vessel), a **thali** (a type of vessel), a **pihadag** (a type of vessel), a **kinha** (a type of vessel), a **udae** (a type of vessel), a **mukhe** (a type of vessel), a **muyange** (a type of vessel), a **nandīmuinge** (a type of vessel), a **praling** (a type of vessel), a **sughosha** (a type of vessel), a **daddare** (a type of vessel), a **panave** (a type of vessel), a **padhag** (a type of vessel), a **jhalari** (a type of vessel), a **bheri** (a type of vessel), a **kutdhumbag** (a type of vessel), and a **nadi** (a type of vessel).

## Third Question: How large are the hells?

[229]  The touch of a group of needles, the touch of a prickly vine, the sting of a scorpion, the touch of embers, flames, the fire of a furnace, a burning coal, a burning piece of wood, the fire of a red-hot iron ball - is the touch of the hells like any of these? The Lord said, "No, their touch is even more unpleasant than these." In the same way, one should understand the touch of the hells up to the seventh earth.

How large are the hells? 84. "O Venerable One! How large are the hells on the Ratnapraba earth?" "Gautama! This Jambudvipa, which is the innermost of all the islands, the smallest of all the island-oceans, is round like a fried cake, round like a chariot wheel, round like a lotus seed, round like a full moon, and is one hundred thousand yojanas in length and breadth. Its circumference is slightly more than three lakh sixteen thousand two hundred twenty-seven yojanas, three kos, one hundred twenty-eight dhanus, and thirteen and a half angulas. A god, who is very powerful and has great influence, could traverse this entire Jambudvipa in three snaps of his fingers, saying 'now, now'. He would travel with a divine speed, which is excellent, swift, agile, fierce, quick, bold, powerful, skillful, and divine. Even if he were to travel for one day, two days, three days, or even for six months at his fastest speed, he would not be able to cross even one of those hells. O Gautama! This is how large the hells on the Ratnapraba earth are. Similarly, it should be understood that the hells on the seventh earth are also very large. In particular, he can cross one of those hells, but he cannot cross the remaining four."

[84] This sutra explains the size of the hells through similes. The question about the size of the hells has already been asked and answered. It was said that some hells are countless thousands of yojanas in size. The phrase "countless thousands of yojanas" clearly indicates... 

Page #274:
---------------------------
[230] (How can we know the extent of this innumerable number? Therefore, the Lord has explained it through an analogy. The analogy is as follows: The island we live on is called Jambudvipa. It is named after the Jambū tree, which is eight yojanas high and made of jewels. Jambudvipa is the innermost of all islands and oceans, meaning it is the most fundamental and the smallest among them. All the subsequent salt oceans and Ghatakikhanda islands are twice the size of Jambudvipa in terms of their dimensions. Jambudvipa is circular, like a fried puri. The term "fried" is used because a puri fried in oil is generally rounder than one fried in ghee. It is round like a chariot wheel, a lotus seed, and a full moon. Different analogies have been used to explain this to people from different countries. The diameter of Jambudvipa is one lakh yojanas. Its circumference is three lakh, sixteen thousand, two hundred and twenty-seven yojanas, three kosas, one hundred and twenty-eight dhanushas, and slightly more than thirteen and a half angulas. A god who possesses great wealth, is radiant, strong, glorious, powerful, happy, and has a vast mind and senses that can perceive their objects well, and who has unimaginable power to perform specific actions, can traverse this Jambudvipa twenty-one times in the time it takes to clap three times, saying "I will cross it, I will cross it." If this god were to travel continuously for six months, starting from one day, he could cross some of the Narakas of Ratnaprabha, but not all of them. These Narakas are that vast. The same can be said for Tamahpraba. There are five Narakas in the seventh earth. Of these, the middle one, called Apratisthana, is one lakh yojanas in diameter, and therefore can be crossed. The remaining four Narakas are countless koti-koti yojanas in size, and therefore cannot be crossed. This is how the extent of the Narakas has been explained through analogy. The Narakas are made of... 85. "O Bhagavan! What are the Narakas of Ratnaprabha earth made of?" "Gautama! They are made entirely of vajra (diamond)." In those Narakas, many beings and liberated souls fall, wander, suffer, and are tormented. They are tormented by the heat of the Narakas, by the colors, smells, tastes, and touches of the Narakas. This continues until the seventh earth. [85]

## Third Rebirth: Uppaata [231 (Kharabadar Prithvikaayik) Jivas and Pudgala Decay and are Born, Old Ones Exit and New Ones Arrive / From Dravyathikanaya They are Eternal, But From Varnaparaya, Gandhaparaya, Rasaparaya and Sparshaparaya They are Non-Eternal / This Should be Said Up to the Seventh Earth Downwards. 

The question in the present Sutra is that what are the Ratnaprabhaadi Narakas made of? In the answer it is said that they are entirely Vajramaya, that is, made of Vajra. In them, the Kharabadar Prithvikaayik Jivas and Pudgala decay and are born / That is, the previous Jivas exit and new Jivas arrive and are born / Similarly, some Pudgala decay and some new ones arrive and join / This process of coming and going continues there constantly / Despite this, the creation of Ratnaprabhaadi Narakas is eternal. Therefore, from the perspective of Dravyanaya, they are eternal, they were always, they are always and they will always be / In this way, while being eternal from the perspective of Dravya, their Varna, Gandha, Rasa and Sparsha keep changing, from this perspective they are non-eternal. Jain Siddhant believes in the truth from various perspectives / There is no contradiction in this. There is no contradiction in considering something eternal and non-eternal from different perspectives / Syadvad is a completely consistent principle. 

Uppaata 86. [1] "From where, O Bhagavan, do the Nairyaik of Ratnaprabha Prithvi come and are born? Are they born from Asanjni Jivas, are they born from Sarisrivas, are they born from Pakshis, are they born from Chaupadas, are they born from Uragas, are they born from Isthiyas, or are they born from Matsyas and Manusyas?" "Gautama! They are born from Asanjni Jivas and also from Matsyas and Manusyas." (Here this gatha is to be followed) _ Asanjni Jivas up to the first Naraka, Sarisrivas up to the second Naraka, Pakshis up to the third Naraka, Singhas up to the fourth Naraka. 1. From Sesas, this gatha is to be followed, and with this desire, this gatha should be chanted.

## Third Pratyapatti: Avagahanavara [233]

O Bhagavan! If the Nairyikas of this Ratnaprabha earth were to be taken away one by one every moment, in how much time would this Ratnaprabha earth become empty?

Gautama! The Nairyika beings are innumerable. Even if one Nairyika were to be taken away every moment, even after countless Utsarpini and Avasarpini kalpas have passed, this earth would not become empty. Similarly, this should be said for the seventh earth.

To explain the number of Naraka beings, it has been established through Asatkल्पना that if one Naraka were to be taken away every moment, even after countless Utsarpini and Avasarpini kalpas have passed, their removal would occur. Such a removal has never happened, does not happen, and will never happen. This is merely a hypothetical scenario, created to explain the number of Naraka beings.

Avagahanavara 86. [3]

O Bhagavan! What are the two types of body sizes of the Nairyikas on the Ratnaprabha earth?

Gautama! There are two types of body sizes, namely: Bhavadharani and Uttarveubviya.

The Bhavadharani is as large as an angula (finger) multiplied by an uncountable number, and then multiplied by seven Dhanu (bows) and three Ratnis (jewels).

The Uttarveubviya is as large as an angula (finger) multiplied by an uncountable number, and then multiplied by fifteen Dhanu (bows) and eight Ratnis (jewels).

In summary:

* Bhavadharani: fifteen Dhanu (bows) and eight Ratnis (jewels) multiplied by an uncountable number of angulas.
* Uttarveubviya: thirty-one Dhanu (bows) and one Ratni (jewel) multiplied by an uncountable number of angulas.

Furthermore:

* Bhavadharani: one Ratni (jewel) multiplied by thirty-one Dhanu (bows).
* Uttarveubviya: two Ratnis (jewels) multiplied by thirty-one Dhanu (bows).

Additionally:

* Bhavadharani: two Ratnis (jewels) multiplied by sixty-two Dhanu (bows).
* Uttarveubviya: one hundred Ratnis (jewels) multiplied by nineteen Dhanu (bows).

Finally:

* Bhavadharani: one hundred Ratnis (jewels) multiplied by nineteen Dhanu (bows).
* Uttarveubviya: one hundred Ratnis (jewels) multiplied by eight Dhanu (bows).

* Bhavadharani: one hundred Ratnis (jewels) multiplied by eight Dhanu (bows).
* Uttarveubviya: one hundred Ratnis (jewels) multiplied by five Dhanu (bows).

[234] [Jivajovaabhigamsutra Sattamaae Bhavadharanija Pंच Dhanusayaai, Uttarveubdhie Ghanusahassan. [86] (3) O Bhagavan! How much is the body-immersion of the Nairyakas of this Ratnapraba earth said to be? Gautama! Two types of body-immersion are said, namely Bhavadharaniy and Uttarvaikriy / Bhavadharaniy immersion is from the insignificant to the countless part of an angul and from the excellent to seven dhanus, three hands and six anguls. Uttarvaikriy immersion is from the insignificant to the countable part of an angul, from the excellent to fifteen dhanus, two and a half hands. The second, the body-immersion of the Nairyakas of Sharkarapraba is from the insignificant to the countless part of an angul, from the excellent to fifteen dhanus, two and a half hands. Uttarvaikriy is from the insignificant to the countable part of an angul, from the excellent to thirty-one dhanus, one hand. In the third hell, Bhavadharaniy is thirty-one dhanus, one hand and Uttarvaikriy is sixty-two dhanus, two hands / In the fourth hell, Bhavadharaniy is sixty-two dhanus, two hands and Uttarvaikriy is one hundred and twenty-five dhanus. In the fifth hell, Bhavadharaniy is one hundred and twenty-five dhanus and Uttarvaikriy is two hundred and fifty dhanus. In the sixth hell, Bhavadharaniy is two hundred and fifty dhanus and Uttarvakriy is five hundred dhanus. "In the seventh hell, Bhavadharaniy is five hundred dhanus and Uttarvaikriy is one thousand dhanus / Discussion-In the present sutra, the immersion of the body of the Nairyakas is stated. There are two types of immersion of their body. One is that which happens at the time of Bhavadharana and the other is Uttarvaikriy, which is done by the attainment of Vaikriy. Both types of immersion are of two types, insignificant and excellent, due to the difference in the effort. In this way, the form of four types of immersion of each hell's naraka is described / (1) The Bhavadharaniy immersion of the Nairyakas of Ratnapraba is from the insignificant to the countless part of an angul and from the excellent to seven dhanus, three hands and six anguls / Uttarvaikriy is from the insignificant to the countable part of an angul and from the excellent to fifteen dhanus, two hands and one vent (two vents make one hand) hence in the original it is said two and a half hands / (2) In Sharkarapraba, Bhavadharaniy is from the insignificant to the countless part of an angul and from the excellent to 15 dhanus, 2 // hands / Uttarvaikriy is from the insignificant to the countable part of an angul and from the excellent to 31 dhanus, 1 hand. Similarly, in the further earths also, Bhavadharaniy should be said from the insignificant to the countless part of an angul and Uttarvaikriy from the insignificant to the countable part of an angul / Because due to the lack of such effort

## Third Rebirth: The Gate of Descent [235]

The initial response in the first time is only as much as the numerical part of an angula. This is how one should understand the exaggeration. Therefore, the statement of the excellent *bhavadharani* and excellent *uttarakriya* descent in the subsequent earths is made in the original text.

(3) In the third *balukaprabha*, the excellent *bhavadharani* is 31 *dhanus* and 1 *hasta*, and the *uttarakriya* is 62 *dhanus*.

(4) In the fourth *pankaprabha*, the excellent *bhavadharani* is 62 *dhanus*, and the *uttarakriya* is 125 *dhanus*.

(5) In the fifth *dhumaprabha*, the excellent *bhavadharani* is 125 *dhanus*, and the *uttarakriya* is 250 *dhanus*.

(6) In the sixth *tamasprabha*, the excellent *bhavadharani* is 250 *dhanus*, and the *uttarakriya* is 500 *dhanus*.

(7) In the seventh *tamas-tamasprabha*, the excellent *bhavadharani* is 500 *dhanus*, and the *uttarakriya* is 1000 *dhanus*.

The excellent *bhavadharani* descent of each hellish earth is double that of the previous earth, and the *uttarakriya* descent of the *nairyikas* of each earth is double their *bhavadharani* descent.

The following table will help in understanding the descent:

| Earth Name | *Bhavadharani* | *Uttarakriya* |
|---|---|---|
| *Ratnapraba* |  *Asankhyatava* of an angula | 7 *dhanus* 3 *hasta* 6 angula | *Asankhyatava* of an angula |
| *Sharkaraprabha* | 15 *dhanus* 2 *hasta* | 31 *dhanus* 1 *hasta* | 15 *dhanus* 2 *hasta* |
| *Balukaprabha* | 31 *dhanus* 1 *hasta* | 62 *dhanus* 2 *hasta* | 31 *dhanus* 1 *hasta* |
| *Pankaprabha* | 62 *dhanus* 2 *hasta* | 125 *dhanus* | 62 *dhanus* 2 *hasta* |
| *Dhumaprabha* | 125 *dhanus* | 250 *dhanus* | 125 *dhanus* |
| *Tamasprabha* | 250 *dhanus* | 500 *dhanus* | 250 *dhanus* |
| *Tamas-tamasprabha* | 500 *dhanus* | 1000 *dhanus* | 500 *dhanus* |

The measure of descent in the *prastutas* of *ratnapraba* etc. is as follows: *Ratnapraba* has 13 *prastutas*. In the first *prastuta*, the excellent descent is 3 *hasta*. After that, in each *prastuta*, there is an increase of 56 angulas. One should say this. With this measure, the descent of 13 *prastutas* is as follows:

In the second, in the sixth, 1 hand, third *pratipatti*: *avagahana-dwar* [237] Similarly, in the first *prastut* of *baluka-prabha*, the same *avagahana* is as in the last *prastut* of the second earth - that is, 15 *dhanush* 2 hands and 12 *angul*. After this, in each *prastut*, an increase of 7 hands 19 *angul* should be said. Its proof will be as follows: In the first *prastut*, 15 *dhanush* 2 hands 12 *angul*, in the second, 17 *dhanush* 2 hands 7 *angul*, in the third, 16 *dhanush* 2 hands 3 *angul*, in the fourth, 21 *dhanush* 1 hand 22 *angul*, in the fifth, 23 *dhanush* 1 hand 18 *angul*, in the sixth, 25 *dhanush* 1 hand 13 *angul*, in the seventh, 27 *dhanush* 1 hand 9 *angul*, in the eighth, 29 *dhanush* 1 hand 4 *angul*, in the ninth, 31 *dhanush* 0 *angul*. There are seven *prastut* in *panka-prabha*. In the first *prastut*, the same *avagahana* is as in the ninth *prastut* of the previous *baluka-prabha*. After this, in each, an increase of 5 *dhanush* 20 *angul* should be said. The proof of the *avagahana* of each *prastut* will be as follows: In the first *prastut*, 31 *dhanush* 1 hand, in the second, 36 *dhanush* 1 hand 20 *angul*, in the third, 41 *dhanush* 2 hands, in the fourth, 46 *dhanush* 3 hands 12 *angul*, in the fifth, 52 *dhanush* 0 hands, in the sixth, 57 *dhanush* 1 hand, in the seventh, 62 *dhanush* 2 hands 0 *angul*. There are five *prastut* in *dhuma-prabha*. In the first *prastut*, the same *avagahana* is as in the last *prastut* of the previous earth. After this, an increase of 15 *dhanush* 2 hands should be said in each *prastut*. Its proof will be as follows: In the first *prastut*, 62 *dhanush* 2 hands, in the second, 78 *dhanush* 1 *vitasti* (half hand), in the third, 93 *dhanush* 3 hands, in the fourth, 109 *dhanush* 1 hand 1 *vitasti*, in the fifth, 125 *dhanush*. There are three *prastut* in *tama-prabha-prithvi*. The first *prastut* has the same *avagahana* as the last *prastut* of the previous earth. After this, an increase of 62 *dhanush* should be said in each *prastut*. Its proof is as follows: 16 *angul*, 8 *angul*, 4 *angul*, in the sixth, in the second.

## Third Chapter: Lesya and Other Doors [239]

**Bhagavan! What is the smell of the bodies of the Nairyikas on this Ratnaprabha earth?**

**Gautama!** It should be said as before, like a dead snake, etc. The smell of the Narakas up to the seventh earth should be known in the same way.

**Bhagavan!** What is the touch of the bodies of the Nairyikas on this Ratnaprabha earth?

**Gautama!** Their bodies are devoid of luster, rough, hard, perforated, and rough like a burnt object due to their skin being torn and wrinkled. (Their bodies are rough like baked bricks). The same should be said up to the seventh earth.

**Discussion:** This has been discussed before.

**58. [1] Bhagavan!** How do the Pudgalas transform into the breath of the Nairyikas on this Ratnaprabha earth?

**Gautama!** The Pudgalas that are Aniṣṭa (unfavorable) up to Amaṇama (unpleasant) transform into the breath of the Nairyikas. The same should be said for the Narayikas up to the seventh earth. Similarly, the Pudgalas that are Aniṣṭa and Amaṇama transform into the food of the Nairyikas. The same should be known about the Narakas of the seven Naraka earths, Ratnaprabha, etc.

**Lesya and Other Doors 88. [2] Bhagavan!** How many Lesyas are present in the Nairyikas on this Ratnaprabha earth?

**On Pankaprabha, one Neelalesya is present.**

**On Dhumaprabha, two Lesyas are present, namely:** Kinhlalesya and Neelalesya. Of these, Neelalesya is more numerous, and Kinhlalesya is less numerous.

## Third Rebirth: Leshyadwar

**[241]** **O Bhagavan!** Are the Naryikas of this Ratnapraba earth knowledgeable or ignorant? **Gautama:** They are both knowledgeable and ignorant. Those who are knowledgeable are definitely those with three types of knowledge: **Bhinibodhikgyani**, **Shrutagnyani**, and **Avadhigyani**. Those who are ignorant are either those with two types of ignorance or those with three types of ignorance. Those with two types of ignorance are, by rule, **Mati-agnyani** and **Shruta-agnyani**, and those with three types of ignorance are, by rule, **Mati-agnyani**, **Shruta-agnyani**, and **Vibhanggyani**. The Naryikas of the remaining earth, like Sharkarapraba, are also both knowledgeable and ignorant. Those who are knowledgeable have all three types of knowledge, and those who are ignorant have all three types of ignorance. The same should be said for the Naryikas of the seventh earth.

**O Bhagavan!** Are the Naryikas of this Ratnapraba earth **Manayoga**, **Vachanayoga**, or **Kayayoga**? **Gautama:** They are all three. The same should be said for the seventh earth.

**O Bhagavan!** Are the Naryikas of this Ratnapraba earth **Sakar Upayoga** or **Anakar Upayoga**? **Gautama:** They are both **Sakar Upayoga** and **Anakar Upayoga**. The same should be said for the seventh earth.

**[O Bhagavan!** How much area do the Naryikas of this Ratnapraba earth know and see through **Avadhi**? **Gautama:** They know and see an area of three and a half Kos from the lowest point and four Kos from the highest point. The Naryikas of Sharkarapraba know and see three Kos from the lowest point and three and a half Kos from the highest point. In this way, you should say, decreasing by half a Kos, that the Naryikas of the seventh earth know and see an area of half a Kos from the lowest point and one Kos from the highest point.]

**O Bhagavan!** How many **Samudghatas** are mentioned for the Naryikas of this Ratnapraba earth? **Gautama:** Four **Samudghatas** are mentioned: **Vedanasamudghata**, **Kshayasamudghata**, **Maranantikasamudghata**, and **Vaikriyasamudghata**. The same should be said for the Naryikas of the seventh earth.

The commentator has mentioned that there are many different readings in many manuscripts. It is not possible to explain all the variations in readings. Only the reading that is found in many manuscripts and is not contradictory has been taken. Even with variations in readings, there is no difference in meaning. The text within the brackets in the original text is not found in the commentary. The subject matter of this sutra has been explained earlier. In **Leshyadwar**, there is a collection of verses from the **Shri Bhagavati Sutra** as follows:

"**Kaau dosu taiyaae miisiaa niiliyaa chauththiieae / Panchhamiyaaeae miisaa kanhaa tatto parmakanhaa //**"

## 242] The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra states that some have two types of ignorance and some have three. This means that those who are born from the five senses without consciousness do not have Vibhangajnan in their imperfect state, therefore only two types of knowledge are possible. In the remaining time, all three types of ignorance are present. Those who are born from the five senses with consciousness have Vibhangajnan even in their imperfect state, therefore all three types of ignorance are always possible. In the Naraka-Padhvis like Sharkaraprabha and beyond, only those with conscious five senses are born. Therefore, except for the first Ratnapraba-Prithvi, all other Prithvis have all three types of knowledge. The rest is clear from the original text.

## 88. [1]  "O Bhagavan! How do the Nairyikas of Ratnapraba-Prithvi experience hunger and thirst?" 
"Gautama! If all the water of the oceans and all the food substances were poured into the mouth of a Nairyika of Ratnapraba-Prithvi, even then his hunger would not be satisfied, nor his thirst quenched, according to the Asatkल्पना. O Gautama! Such intense hunger and thirst are experienced by the Nairyikas of Ratnapraba. Similarly, one should understand the same for the Nairyikas of the seventh Prithvi."

## 89. [2] "O Bhagavan! Do the Nairyikas of Ratnapraba-Prithvi experience pain individually or collectively?"
"Gautama! They experience pain both individually and collectively. While experiencing pain individually, they experience intense suffering, like being crushed by a mountain, a mortar, a pestle, a wheel, a sword, a spear, a hook, a chain, a whip, a club, a hammer, a thunderbolt, a mace, a spear, a needle, a thorn, a firebrand, a burning coal, a burning iron, a burning stone, a burning potsherd, a burning brick, a burning wood, a burning straw, a burning hair, a

## Third Rebirth: One-Many-Transformation

[243] The Mahantas of the Lohiya-Kunkhuru-Vai, Dharam-May-Tund-Vai, and Gom-May-Kod-Samana-Vai, are scattered about. They are scattered, and while eating, they eat, and while moving, they move, and while entering, they enter, and they experience pain. The pain is bright, burning, vast, deep, harsh, bitter, rough, cruel, fierce, intense, painful, unbearable, and difficult to endure. [9] (2) O Bhagavan! Are the Nairyikas of the Ratna-Prabha-Prithvi capable of creating one form or many forms? Gautama! They can create one form and many forms. While creating one form, they are capable of creating a mudgar form, similarly a musandi (a special weapon), karvat, sword, shakti, plow, gada, musal, chakra, arrow, spear, tomar, shul, lakut (stick), and bindamal (a special weapon). While creating many forms, they create many mudgar, bhushandi, and bindamal. While transforming these many weapon forms, they can only transform the number of weapons, not countless. They can transform those connected to their body, not those unconnected. They can create similar forms, not dissimilar. By creating these various weapons, they strike each other Nairyikas and produce pain. That pain is bright, meaning it does not have even a little bit of happiness, it burns. It is vast, because it is spread throughout the entire body. It is deep, because it is spread throughout the vital points. It is harsh, like the clash of stone blocks breaks the limbs of the body, similarly that pain breaks the inner parts of the soul. It is bitter, like a bitter medicine. It is rough, because it creates roughness in the mind. It is cruel, because it is impossible to retaliate, making it impenetrable. It is fierce, because it causes anger and determination. It is intense, because it is excessive. It is painful, unbearable, and difficult to endure. This should be said up to the Dhum-Prabha-Prithvi (fifth hell). The Nairyikas of the sixth and seventh Prithvi create many and large (like dung beetles) red kunthus, whose mouths are like a vajra and who are like dung beetles. By transforming into such a kunthu form, they climb onto each other's bodies, repeatedly cut their bodies, and like the insects of the sugarcane stalk, they enter inside and produce bright, unbearable pain. 89. [3] O Bhagavan! Do the Nairyikas of the Rayan-Prabha-Prithvi experience cold pain, hot pain, or both? Gautama! They do not experience cold pain, they experience hot pain, not both, and so on up to the Balay-Prabha. In the Pank-Prabha, Gautama! They experience both cold and hot pain, but they do not experience both cold and hot pain. Those who experience hot pain are more numerous, and those who experience cold pain are fewer. 1, Here in the manuscripts, the reading ('te appyara upahajonia vedeti') is excessive and does not make sense. It seems to be a mistake. Editor.

## Third Pratipati: Eka-Aneka-Vikurvaga

**[245 Gautam!** They are constantly afraid, constantly terrified, constantly hungry, constantly anxious, constantly harassed, constantly experiencing the consequences of karma like a killer, constantly experiencing the ultimate evil, the unparalleled evil, and the continuous evil of hell.  

**Similarly, it should be said up to the seventh earth.** In the seventh earth, five great hells, the greatest of the great, have been mentioned, namely: Kal, Mahakal, Rorav, Maharorav, and Apratisthan. 

**There, these five great men, having accumulated the most excellent sins of violence, etc., at the time of death, died and were born in the Apratisthan hell as Nairyikas:** 1. Parashuram, the son of Jamadagni, 2. Dridhayau, the son of Lachchati, 3. Uparichar Vasuraj, 4. Subhum, the Kaurava, and 5. Brahmadatt, the son of Chulan. 

**They were born there as Nairyikas, who are black in color, with a black image, and extremely black, etc.** This description should be given until they experience the extremely blazing, vast, and unbearable pain there.

**Discussion:** This sutra describes the pain of hell beings related to hunger and thirst, the pain inflicted on each other by the use of various weapons, the pain of cold, the pain of heat, and the pain caused by hell.

**Mouth Pain:** Describing the hunger and thirst of hell beings through false imagination, it is said that if all edible substances were put into the mouth of one hell being and all the water of the oceans was given to him, even then his hunger would not be satisfied, nor would his thirst be quenched. 

**A little imagination of this can be obtained from the condition of a man suffering from the most severe burning disease in this human world.** Such hell beings are forced to endure such intense hunger and thirst.

**Weapon Vikurvana Pain:** These hell beings inflict intense blows on each other using various weapons, both single and multiple. They inflict intense pain on each other, therefore they are those who inflict pain on each other. The word "puhuttam" used in the text indicates multiplicity. Through this action, they inflict brilliant, vast, deep, harsh, bitter, rough, cruel, fierce, intense, painful, difficult to obtain, and unbearable pain on others. 

**This Vikurvana form of pain should be understood up to the fifth hell.** In the sixth and seventh hells, the hell beings, with vajra-like mouths, become like red and dung beetles, taking the form of large Kunthutras, climb on each other's bodies, and bite and cut, entering deep into the other hell being's body, like the sugarcane worm that eats the sugarcane and sieves it, they sieve the hell being's body and inflict pain.

**Cold, etc., Pain:** The hell beings of Ratnaprabha earth do not experience cold pain, they experience heat pain, they do not experience cold and heat pain. These hell beings are of cold origin. Except for the place of origin, the entire land is hotter than charcoal, therefore these hell beings experience heat pain, not cold pain. The combined pain of cold and heat is absent in hell from the very beginning. In Sharkaraprabha and Balukaprabha, there is also only heat pain. In Pankaprabha, there is also cold pain, and... 

Page #290:
---------------------------
## 246] [Jivajivamigamasutra] There is also the sensation of heat. Some hell beings experience cold sensations, while others experience hot sensations due to the different types of hell. There are more hell beings who experience hot sensations than those who experience cold sensations. In Dhumra-prabha, both types of sensations exist, but there are more who experience cold sensations and fewer who experience hot sensations. The sixth hell has cold sensations because the hell beings there are born with hot yonis (genitals). Except for the yoni-sthanas (genital areas), the entire region is extremely cold like ice, therefore they have to experience cold sensations. In the seventh earth, there is extremely intense cold sensation. The hell beings in the Naraka-bhumis like Bhavanubhava-vedana, Ratna-prabha, etc., are constantly afraid and apprehensive due to the extremely dense darkness that pervades the region. They are constantly tormented by the suffering caused by the Parmadhamika Devas and the mutual suffering of the hell beings. They are constantly anxious due to the experience of suffering, they do not get even a moment of peace due to constant harassment, they constantly experience the inauspicious, inauspicious form, and the inauspicious form of the accumulated hell-existence. This statement is true for all hells, only those beings who perform extremely cruel karmas are born in the seventh earth, the A-pratiṣṭhāna Narakavāsa, not others. As an example, here are mentioned five great men who were born in the seventh earth, the Pratiṣṭhāna Narakavāsa, by binding cruel karmas that bind them to a very excellent state and a very excellent section. They are: 1. Parashurama, the son of Jamadagni, 2. Dridhayau, the son of Lachchati (according to the commentator, Chatisuta Dahadal), 3. Uparichar Vasuraja, 4. Subhum, the eighth Chakravarti of the Koravya gotra, and 5. Brahmadatta Chakravarti, the son of Chulani. It is said that Parashurama destroyed the Kshatriyas 21 times, making the earth Kshatriya-less. Subhum was the 14th Chakravarti. He made the earth Brahmin-less seven times. Such is the legend. This can only happen through intense, cruel determination. Brahmadatta Chakravarti was extremely attached to enjoyment and his determination was extremely cruel. Vasuraja, the Uparichar, is famous for being very truthful, and for this reason, even though he was seated on a crystal throne, the crystal throne was not visible to the people, so it was spread that the king would not speak untruth even at the cost of his life. Due to his power, he was situated above the earth, in the sky. Once, there was a dispute between the mountain and Narada about the word 'Aj' in the Vedas. The mountain interpreted 'Aj' as a goat and advocated for a violent sacrifice. While Narada, with right vision, interpreted 'Aj' as 'not born'. Both came to Vasuraja for justice. For some reason, Vasuraja sided with the mountain and encouraged the violent sacrifice. Due to this lie, the Devas were angered and they slapped him and threw him off the throne. He died due to anger and cruel consequences and was born in the seventh earth, the A-pratiṣṭhāna Narakavāsa. The aforementioned five great men and other such extremely cruel beings, having earned the most excellent sinful karma, were born there and are experiencing the brilliant, abundant, and unbearable pain of inauspicious color, smell, touch, etc.

[Third Chapter: The Nature of Hot Sensations] [247 The Nature of Hot Sensations 89. [5] Venerable Sir! In those who experience hot sensations, how do they dwell, being overcome by heat? Gotama! Just as a blacksmith, being young, strong, vigorous, and having a firm grip, with his hands and feet protected by leather, is able to overcome the force of the wind, the speed of the wind, the force of the wind, the dust of the wind, and the heat of the wind, with his strong arms, strong thighs, strong legs, and strong back, and with his chest full of strength, and with his body protected by six layers of clothing, and being skilled, knowledgeable, and a master of his craft, takes a single large piece of iron, heats it up, and then hammers it, hammers it, beats it, beats it, grinds it, grinds it, until it becomes either one-eighth, one-fourth, or one-third of its original size, and then, with great force, he throws it into a cold, very cold, and very deep pit, where it is impossible to retrieve it, so too, in those who experience hot sensations, being overcome by heat, they are thrown into a state of suffering. And then, after a moment, they will again be reborn in a state of suffering, they will be reborn in a state of suffering, they will be reborn in a state of suffering, and they will not be able to escape from this cycle of suffering, they will not be able to escape from this cycle of suffering, they will not be able to escape from this cycle of suffering.

## Third Rebirth: The Nature of Cold 

(249) Thus, when the heat and other afflictions subside, the being falls asleep there, closes its eyes, and its memory, joy, fortitude, and mental clarity return. In this way, it becomes cool and calm, and gradually emerges from there, experiencing great happiness and peace. 

Similarly, O Gautama! According to the wrong perception, a Nairyika being, after emerging from the hot hells, enters this human world. It sees the ovens for baking sweets, the ovens for making alcohol, the ovens for burning goat dung, the ovens for smelting iron, the ovens for smelting copper, and similarly, the ovens for smelting lead, silver, gold, and other metals, the potter's kiln, the fire of the blacksmith, the fire of the brick kiln, the fire of the lime kiln, the fire of the blacksmith's forge, the fire of the sugarcane juice boiler, the fire of sesame seeds, the fire of husks, the fire of bamboo, and other fires and places of fire, which are hot and have become like fire, red like blooming Palasa flowers, from which thousands of sparks are flying, thousands of flames are rising, thousands of embers are scattered, and which are extremely radiant, burning fiercely within. When a Naraka being sees such places of fire and fires, and enters them, it quenches its heat (the heat of hell), removes its thirst, hunger, and burning, and as a result, it sleeps there, closes its eyes, gains memory, joy, fortitude, and mental clarity, and becomes cool, experiencing great peace. Gradually emerging from there, it experiences great happiness and peace. 

The Lord said this, and Gautama asked, "O Lord! Is there such intense heat in the hells?" The Lord said, "No, that is not the case. Naraka beings experience even more severe heat."

## The Nature of Cold 

89. [5] "O Lord! In the cold hells, how do the Nairyika beings experience the cold?"

"O Gautama! Just as a blacksmith, in his workshop, takes a young, strong, and powerful iron rod, and while working on it, hammers it again and again, and for a month, he heats it with a single, double, or triple fire, and then, due to its unbearable heat, throws it into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into the cold hells, where it is thrown into

---------------------------
[210] [The first sutra of the Jiva-Jiva-Abhigma Sutra, or the Sutra of the Approach of Souls, is as follows: Just as a blacksmith's son, who is young, strong, and skilled, takes a large piece of iron, the size of a small water pot, and heats it, beats it, and forges it for a day, two days, three days, or even a month, and then, with a pair of tongs, grasps the hot and fully heated ball of iron, and with a false notion, throws it into the cold hell (thinking, "I will take it out in the blink of an eye," but sees it melting, dissolving, and perishing, and is unable to take it out in its unmelted form), so should one describe the situation of the Niryayika in the cold hell. And one should also describe the example of the elephant in the same way, as it emerges from the lake and roams about in peace and comfort.] In the same way, O Gautama, the Niryayika, who has emerged from the cold hell with a false notion, sees the cold places in this human world, such as snow, snowdrifts, snowfields, snowfield clusters, frost, frost clusters, snow ponds, snow pond clusters, ice, and cold clusters, and enters them. There, he quenches his hellish cold, thirst, hunger, fever, and burning, and experiences peace and sleeps, closing his eyes, until he warms up, becomes very warm, and slowly emerges from there, experiencing happiness and comfort. O Gautama, the Niryayika in the cold hell experiences even worse cold than this. [90] O Venerable One, how long is the state of the Niryayika in the Ratna-Prabha-Pruthvi (Earth of Radiant Jewels) described? Gautama, it should be described according to the position of the Pannvana, from the lowest to the highest, up to the seventh earth below. [91] O Venerable One, where do the Niryayika of the Ratna-Prabha-Pruthvi go after they emerge from there? Where do they go? Do they go to the Niryayika, or do they go to the Tiryak-Joni (animal realms)? The description of their emergence should be given in the same way as it is described in the scriptures, up to the highest.

## Third Chapter: Udvartana

**[251]** Are they born in the Nairyikas, or in the Tiryanchikas? Thus, Udvartana should be said as it is said in the Vyutkrantipad of Prajnapanasutra, here also it should be said up to the seventh earth below.

**Discussion:** In this Sutra, it is said that the state of Nairyikas and the subject of Udvartana should be known according to the Prajnapanasutra. What is said in the Prajnapanasutra needs to be mentioned here. That statement is as follows:

The name of the earth, the lowest state, the highest state, Ratnaprabha, Sharkaraprabha, Balakaprabha, Pankaprabha, Dhumaprabha, Tamasprabha, Tamas-tamas-prabha, ten thousand years, one Sagaropama, three Sagaropama, seven Sagaropama, ten Sagaropama, seventeen Sagaropama, twenty-two Sagaropama, one Sagaropama, three Sagaropama, seven Sagaropama, ten Sagaropama, seventeen Sagaropama, thirty-three Sagaropama.

According to the Prastata, there are 13 Prastatas of Ratnaprabha, their state is as follows:

**Prastata** | **Lowest State** | **Highest State**
------- | -------- | --------
First Prastata | Ten thousand years | Ninety thousand years
Second Prastata | Ten lakh years | Ninety lakh years
Third Prastata | Ninety lakh years | Purva-koti Sagaropama's tenth part
Fourth Prastata | Purva-koti Sagaropama's tenth part | Sagaropama's two-tenths
Fifth Prastata | Sagaropama's two-tenths | Sagaropama's three-tenths
Sixth Prastata | Sagaropama's three-tenths | Sagaropama's four-tenths
Seventh Prastata | Sagaropama's four-tenths | Sagaropama's five-tenths
Eighth Prastata | Sagaropama's five-tenths | Sagaropama's six-tenths
Ninth Prastata | Sagaropama's six-tenths | Sagaropama's seven-tenths
Tenth Prastata | Sagaropama's seven-tenths | Sagaropama's eight-tenths
Eleventh Prastata | Sagaropama's eight-tenths | Sagaropama's nine-tenths
Twelfth Prastata | Sagaropama's nine-tenths | Sagaropama's ten-tenths (i.e. full one Sagaropama)
Thirteenth Prastata | One Sagaropama | Three Sagaropama

254 [Jivajiva Mimmasutra]  "Bhagavan, how do the Niryayikas of Ratnaprabhaprithvi experience the touch of the earth?"  "Gautama, they experience the touch of the earth as unpleasant, painful, and unbearable."  "Similarly, this should be said for the seventh earth."  "Bhagavan, how do the Niryayikas of Ratnaprabhaprithvi experience the touch of water?"  "Gautama, they experience the touch of water as unpleasant, painful, and unbearable."  "Similarly, this should be said for the seventh earth."  "Similarly, one should know about the touch of light, air, and plants for the Niryayikas from Ratnaprabhaprithvi to the seventh earth."  "Bhagavan, is this Ratnaprabhaprithvi larger in thickness than the other earths and smaller in length and breadth?"  "Yes, Gautama, this Ratnaprabhaprithvi is larger in thickness than the other earths and smaller in length and breadth."  "Bhagavan, is the second earth, called Sharkaraprabha, larger in thickness than the third earth and smaller in length and breadth?"  "Yes, Gautama, the second earth is larger in thickness than the third earth and smaller in length and breadth."  "Similarly, this should be said until the sixth earth is larger in thickness than the seventh earth and smaller in length and breadth."  [92]  **Discussion:** This sutra discusses the experiences of the Niryayikas regarding the touch of the earth, water, light, air, and plants in the hellish earths. The Niryayika beings are not at all for happiness, therefore they find the touch of the earth, etc. there to be unpleasant, painful, unpleasant, unbearable, and unbearable.  Although there is no direct fire in the hellish earths, the touch of the hellish walls transformed into heat and the indirect heat of the scorching sun should be understood there.

## Sutīya Pratipatti: The Touch-Based Representation of Earths in Hells [255]

**Along with this sūtra, it is also explained that this Ratnaprabhā earth is the largest in terms of thickness, as its thickness is 180,000 yojanas, and the thickness of the subsequent earths is less. The second earth is 132,000 yojanas thick, the third is 128,000 yojanas thick, the fourth is 120,000 yojanas thick, the fifth is 118,000 yojanas thick, the sixth is 116,000 yojanas thick, and the seventh is 108,000 yojanas thick. In terms of length and breadth, Ratnaprabhā earth is the smallest. Its length and breadth are one rāju. The second earth has a length and breadth of two rājus. The third has three rājus, the fourth has four rājus, the fifth has five rājus, the sixth has six rājus, and the seventh has a length and breadth of seven rājus. In terms of thickness, the subsequent earths are smaller, and in terms of length and breadth, the subsequent earths are larger. [93]**

**"O Bhagavan! In each of the thirty lakh narakavāsas of this Ratnaprabhā earth, have all beings, all bhūtas, all jīvas, and all sattvas been born in the past as earth-bodied, non-bodied, air-bodied, plant-bodied, and hell-bodied?" "Yes, Gautama! They have been born many times or an infinite number of times. This should be said up to the seventh earth. The special feature is that the number of narakavāsas in each earth should be mentioned there."**

**"O Bhagavan! In the regions bordering the narakavāsas of this Ratnaprabhā earth, are the earth-bodied, up to plant-bodied, jīvas, great in karma, great in action, great in outflow, and great in suffering?" "Yes, Gautama! The earth-bodied, up to plant-bodied, jīvas in the regions bordering the narakavāsas of this Ratnaprabhā earth are great in karma, great in action, great in outflow, and great in suffering."**

**"Similarly, this should be said up to the seventh earth."**

## Translation:

**[256] The *Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra* Commentary**

This sutra presents two important questions and their answers. The first question is: "O Bhagavan! Have all beings, all *bhutas*, all *jivas*, and all *sattvas* been born in these types of hells before?" Bhagavan said, "Yes, Gautama! All worldly *jivas* have been born in each of these hells many times or even an infinite number of times in the past. The world is eternal, and from time immemorial, all worldly *jivas* have been undergoing birth and death. Therefore, they have been born in these hells many times or an infinite number of times. It is said, 'There is no such caste and no such womb where this *jiva* has not been born and died an infinite number of times.'

The words *pran*, *bhut*, *jiva*, and *sattva* appear in the original text. The *acharyas* have explained them as follows: 'The term *pran* refers to the two-sensed, three-sensed, and four-sensed *jivas*. The term *bhut* refers to plants. The term *jiva* refers to the five-sensed *jivas*. The remaining *jivas* of the earth body, water body, fire body, and air body are encompassed by the term *sattva*.

The present sutra has the reading 'पुढवीकाइयात्ताए जाव वणस्सइकाइयत्ताए'. This generally encompasses the earth-bodied, water-bodied, fire-bodied, air-bodied, and plant-bodied *jivas*. Here, in the *Ratna Prabha* etc., there is an inquiry about the *jivas* born in those respective forms. Since fire-bodied *jivas* are not born in these hellish earths, they should be excluded, and the rest should be understood. The *vrittikara* has also mentioned the same. Therefore, the original meaning is understood in this way.

The second question is: "Are the earth-bodied, water-bodied, fire-bodied, air-bodied, and plant-bodied *jivas* who are born up to the *Ratna Prabha* etc., those who have *maha-karma*, *maha-kriya*, *maha-pasrava*, and *maha-vedana*?" Bhagavan said, "Yes, Gautama! They are those who have *maha-karma* up to *maha-vedana*."

The origin of this question arises from the doubt that these *jivas* are currently in a one-sensed state. They are not yet in that state, nor do they have the means to perform great sinful acts and great endeavors, etc. So how can they have *maha-karma*, *maha-kriya*, *maha-pasrava*, and *maha-vedana*? In resolving this, it is said that these *jivas* have not been freed from the impressions of the great actions they performed in their previous births, such as *pranatipat* etc. Therefore, they are still those who have *maha-kriya*. The cause of *maha-kriya* is *maha-ashrava*. That *maha-ashrava* was also theirs in their previous births, and they have not been freed from it. Therefore...

1. *Pran*, *dvitri-chatur* are said, *bhutas* are also remembered. *Jivas* are to be known as five-sensed, the rest are *sattvas* mentioned.

2. "Born in the earth body, water body, air body, plant body, and hell? Bhagavan said, 'Yes' etc." - *Malayavritti*

## Third Section:  Uddesakarthasangrahani Gathaas

[257 Mahamasrava are also present there. Due to Mahamasrava and Mahakriya, they have abundant Asatavedaniya Karma, therefore they are Mahakarmi and due to this, they are also Mahavedani. 

Uddesakarthasangrahani Gathaas 64:

1.  **Pudhvi Mogahitta Narga Sanganamaeva Bahallan / Vikkhambhaparikkhvevano Ganso Ya Phaso Ya // 1 //**
    * The number of earths, the extent of hell, and the assembly of Narakas are vast.

2.  **Tesim Mahalayaye Uvma Devena Hoi Kayavva / Jivaa Ya Poggala Bakkamati Taaha Sasaya Niraya // 2 //**
    * To illustrate their vastness, the Devata gives an example: Just as there are countless living beings and Pudgalas, so too are there countless Narakas.

3.  **Uvvaayaparimaanam Avaharucchattameva Sanghayanam / Santhana Vanna Gandha Phasa Usasamahaare // 3 //**
    * Their size, the highest level of removal, their assembly, their form, color, smell, touch, and breath are all vast.

4.  **Lesa Vitthi Naane Joguvaoge Taaha Samugdhaaya / Tattho Khuha Pivaasa Viuvana Veyana Ya Bhae // 4 //**
    * Their vision, knowledge, yoga, use, and their state of being are vast.  They experience hunger, thirst, exhaustion, and pain.

5.  **Uvvaalo Purisaanam Provamm Veayanaae Duvihaae / Unbattana Pudhvi U Uvvaano Savvajivaanam // 5 //**
    * The five great men are born on the seventh earth, experiencing two types of pain: heat and cold.  The earth is vast, and all living beings are born on it.

**These are the Sangrahani Gathaas.**

**The Uddesaka is complete.**

[94] This Uddesaka discusses the following topics:

* The number of earths
* The extent of hell
* The assembly of Narakas
* Their thickness, diameter, and circumference
* Their color, smell, and touch
* The Devata's analogy to illustrate their vastness

## Third Understanding - Third Objective

The third objective is introduced to further elaborate on the topic of Niryāṇikas. Its initial sūtra is as follows:

**"The pudgala-pariṇāma of Niryāṇikas is 95."**

**"Bhante! In the realm of Rāyaṇaprabhā, how do the Niryāṇikas experience pudgala-pariṇāma?"**

**"Gotama! From the state of Aṇi-jāya to the state of Amaṇāma, and so on, up to the state of Aheṣattamā, this is the way."**

**"Here, the assembly of humans, the Kesavas, the aquatic beings, the Mandaḷiyas, the Rāyas, and those who have undertaken great endeavors, all experience this."** (1)

**"The duration of life for humans is different, for Tiryaṇmaṇus it is four months, for Devas it is half a month, and for Niryāṇikas it is a period of intense suffering."** (2)

**"The pudgalas that are not in accordance with the niyamas become their food. Their physical form is like a lump of clay, and their niyamas are like a rope."** (3)

**"The Niryāṇikas experience intense suffering, their bodies are disfigured, and their physical form is like a lump of clay."** (4)

**"They experience intense suffering, they are constantly tormented, and they are destined for hell."** (5)

**"The Niryāṇikas are born in the realm of Devas due to their past karma, or due to their present karma."** (6)

**"The lifespan of a Niryāṇika is 500 yojanas. They experience intense suffering, and their bodies are filled with pain."** (7)

**"They have no happiness, only suffering. They are constantly tormented in hell."** (8)

**"Those who have subtle bodies and those who have gross bodies, all experience suffering. They are constantly tormented, and they are destined for hell."** (9)

## 260] [Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra] In hell, the Naryikas experience extreme cold, extreme heat, extreme hunger, extreme thirst, extreme fear, and hundreds of sorrows continuously (without stopping). // 10 // These verses mention the duration of Vikurvana, the transformation of undesirable Pudgalas, inauspicious Vikurvana, eternal Asata, momentary Sata in the Upapata Kala, jumping up and down, not having Sata even for the blink of an eye, the disintegration of the Vaikriya-Sharira, and the hundreds of types of pain experienced by the Naryikas. // 11 // The third Naryaka Uddeshaka is complete. / The description of the Naryikas is finished. Discussion - This Sutra and these verses mention the transformation of the Pudgalas like food, etc., of the Naryika beings. The transformation of the Pudgalas that the Naryika beings consume is always inauspicious, Akant, unpleasant, un-Manojnya, and un-Manam. The transformation of the Pudgalas consumed by the Naryikas from Ratnaprabha to Tamas-Tama:prabha is always inauspicious. / Similarly, the Sutras related to pain, Leshya, name, Gotra, Arati, fear, sorrow, hunger, thirst, disease, Ucchvasa, Anutapa, anger, pride, Maya, greed, Ahar-Sanjna, Bhaya-Sanjna, Maithuna-Sanjna, and Parigraha-Sanjna should also be mentioned. / That is, the transformation of these twenty is also inauspicious for the Naryikas, i.e., it is inauspicious, Akant, unpleasant, un-Manojnya, and un-Manam. Here, the statement of the Parigraha-Sanjna transformation is in the seventh Sutra related to the Earth, and the first verse is mentioned after it. Therefore, the word 'Ettha' in the verse should be taken as the seventh Earth. / The first verse mentions how beings generally go to this seventh Earth. Those who are Naravrishabha Vasudeva, who are very glorious, powerful, prosperous, and extremely attached to sensual pleasures, etc., from an external physical perspective, are often born in this seventh Earth due to their involvement in many wars, etc., destructive activities, and their attachment to possessions and pleasures, etc. / Similarly, those who are like Tandal-Matsya, who are violent and cruel in their intentions, Vasu, etc., Mandalik kings, and Subhumi, etc., Chakravartis, and those who are like Kalasokarik, who are householders who undertake great endeavors, are often born in this seventh Earth. / The word 'Ativayanti' found in the verse indicates 'generally'. (1) The second verse mentions the peak duration of Vikurvana for the Naryikas and, incidentally, for others as well - the peak Vikurvana for the Naryikas lasts until the Antarmuhurta Kala. / The peak Vikurvana for the Tiryanch and humans lasts for four Antarmuhurtas, and the peak Vikurvana for the Devas lasts for fifteen days (half a month). 1.

## Third Rebirth: The Pudgala Pariṇāma of the Narakas [261]

The Pudgala that is undesirable is consumed by the Narakas in the form of food and other things. Their body structure is *Huṇḍa* and that too is of the lowest kind. This is about the *Bhavadhārṇīya* body because in the *Gāthā* about the *Uttara-vaikriya* body it is said:

(3) All Narakas have only *Vikurvaṇā* that is *Aśubha*. Even though they think of creating good *Vikriyā*, due to the arising of unfavorable karma, their *Vikurvaṇā* is definitely *Aśubha*. Their *Uttara-vaikriya* body and the *Bhavadhārṇīya* body are devoid of *Sanhanana* because they are only influenced by bones and the *Uttara-vaikriya* body is also *Huṇḍa-sanstāna* because from their *Bhavapratyay* arises the *Huṇḍa-sanstāna* *Nāmakarma*.

(4) In all the Naraka realms, whether a being is in the lowest state or the highest state, at the time of birth, they experience only *Asāta*. Due to the continuation of the great suffering experienced at the time of death in the previous life, they experience *Asāta* from birth. After birth, they also experience only *Asāta* and they complete the entire Naraka existence in *Asāta*. There is not even a trace of happiness.

(5) Even though in the above *Gāthā* it is said that the Narakas experience only suffering, there is a slight exception. It is explained in this sixth *Gāthā*. Due to *Upapāta*, some Naraka beings experience *Sāta* at the time of *Upapāta*. Those who in the previous life attained death naturally without burning or piercing, do not have a very complex *Pariṇāma*. At that time, they do not have the *Prādhīrupa* (mental) suffering bound from the previous life, nor the pain caused by the nature of the realm, nor the pain caused by *Paramādharmika* actions or mutual hostility. In this situation, due to the influence of suffering, some beings experience *Sāta*. Due to the influence of the Devas, some beings experience *Sāta* for a short time due to the influence of the Devas. For example, Baldeva went to Naraka to alleviate the suffering of Krishna Vasudeva. Similarly, due to the influence of the previous *Sāṅgatīka* Devas, the Narakas experience *Sāta* for a short time. After that, according to the rule, they experience the pain caused by the nature of the realm or other pains.

(6) Due to *Adhyavasāya*, some Narakas experience *Sāta* at the time of the birth of *Samyaktvā* or even after that, perhaps due to a special auspicious *Adhyavasāya*, even while experiencing external pain caused by the realm, etc. The *Āgama* says that at the time of the birth of *Samyaktvā*, the being experiences joy just like a person born blind experiences joy when they gain sight. Even after that, while experiencing external pain caused by the realm, they experience the arising of *Sāta* while feeling special emotions like *Guṇānumoḍana* of the *Tīrthaṅkaras*, etc. Due to the experience of karma, the Naraka beings experience *Sāta* for a moment due to the external cause of the *Kalyāṇaka* of the birth, initiation, knowledge, and liberation of the *Tīrthaṅkaras*, etc., and due to the cause of the arising of the *Vipāka* of various *Sāta* *Vedaniya* *Karma*.

[262] [Jiva-Jivami-gama-sutra] The Nairyaika Jivas, when cooked in cauldrons and pierced with spears, etc., are terrified and writhe in agony, leaping up to five hundred yojanas. They leap from a minimum of one kos to a maximum of five hundred yojanas. [7] There is also a reading: "The Nairyaika Jivas, who are constantly being cooked in the hells, do not even have a moment of happiness, not even for the blink of an eye. There is only suffering, constant suffering." [8] The pudgala of the Nairyaika's Vaikriya body is shattered into thousands of pieces as soon as the Jiva leaves the body. The disintegration of other bodies is also mentioned in this context. The Tejas Karman body, the Sukshma body (i.e., the body of the Sukshma Namkarma), the bodies of the Paryapta and Aparyapta Jivas, the Audarika body, the Vaikriya and Praharaka bodies are also subtle, not perceptible to the naked eye, and the bodies of the Aparyapta Jivas disintegrate as soon as they are left by the Jivas. The atoms of their bodies are shattered. [9] These Naraka Jivas constantly experience hundreds of types of suffering in the hells, such as extreme cold, extreme heat, extreme thirst, extreme hunger, extreme fear, etc. [10] After the above ten verses, the eleventh verse summarizes all that has been said in the previous verses, which is clear from the original meaning. Thus, the third objective of the Naraka description is complete. With this, the description of the Nairyaikas is also complete. [1] "Neraiyanuppamo Gauya Ukkoas Pancajoyanasyai" - this is a reading in some places.

[264] [Jiva-jiva-abhigamsutra [96] (1) What is the nature of the Tiryanch-yoni beings? Tiryanch-yoni beings are said to be of five types, namely 1. Ekaindriya Tiryanch-yoni, 2. Dwiindriya Tiryanch-yoni, 3. Triindriya Tiryanch-yoni, 4. Chaturindriya Tiryanch-yoni and 5. Panchendriya Tiryanch-yoni / What is the nature of Ekaindriya Tiryanch-yoni?

This is the description of Prithvikaayik Ekaindriya Tiryanch-yoni. What are Apkaayik Ekaindriya Tiryanch-yoni? They are of two types, thus four distinctions should be said like Prithvikaayik. Such distinctions should be said up to Vanaspatikaayik E. Tiryanch-yoni. This is the statement of Vanaspatikaayik E. Tiryanch-yoni. 96. [2] What are the Dwiindriya Tiryanch-yoni? Dwiindriya Tiryanch-yoni are of two types, namely Pajjatt Dwiindriya Tiryanch-yoni, Appajatt Dwiindriya Tiryanch-yoni. What are the Dwiindriya Tiryanch-yoni and up to Chaturindriya.

The third understanding: The nature of the Tiryancha (non-human) beings. [265]

There are two types of Tiryancha beings: those that arise from the Samucchima (water) and those that arise from the Aprajatta (non-water) Samucchima. What are the Tiryancha beings that arise from the Samucchima? There are two types of Tiryancha beings that arise from the Samucchima: those that arise from the Pajatta (water) Samucchima and those that arise from the Aprajatta (non-water) Samucchima.

What are the Tiryancha beings that arise from the Samucchima? There are two types of Tiryancha beings that arise from the Samucchima: those that arise from the Palaya (earth) and those that arise from the Jalaya (water). What are the Tiryancha beings that arise from the Palaya? There are two types of Tiryancha beings that arise from the Palaya: those that arise from the Chauppaya (four-footed) and those that arise from the Parisappa (crawling) Palaya.

What are the Tiryancha beings that arise from the Chauppaya? There are two types of Tiryancha beings that arise from the Chauppaya: those that arise from the Samucchima Chauppaya and those that arise from the Gambhava (birth) Chauppaya. Just as there are two types of Jalaya, there are also two types of Chauppaya. What are the Tiryancha beings that arise from the Parisappa? There are two types of Tiryancha beings that arise from the Parisappa: those that arise from the Uraga (snake) Parisappa and those that arise from the Bhuya (earth) Parisappa.

What are the Tiryancha beings that arise from the Uraga Parisappa? There are two types of Tiryancha beings that arise from the Uraga Parisappa: just as there are two types of Jalaya, there are also two types of Uraga Parisappa. Similarly, there are two types of Bhuya Parisappa. What are the Tiryancha beings that arise from the Khahaya (air) Palaya? There are two types of Tiryancha beings that arise from the Khahaya: those that arise from the Samucchima Khahaya and those that arise from the Gambhava Khahaya.

What are the Tiryancha beings that arise from the Samucchima Khahaya? There are two types of Tiryancha beings that arise from the Samucchima Khahaya: those that arise from the Pajatta Samucchima Khahaya and those that arise from the Aprajatta Samucchima Khahaya. Similarly, there are two types of Gambhava Khahaya.

Thus, there are two types of Tiryancha beings that arise from the Khahaya.

What are the Tiryancha beings that arise from the Samucchima? There are three types of Tiryancha beings that arise from the Samucchima: those that arise from the Anda (egg), those that arise from the Pota (womb), and those that arise from the Samucchima. There are three types of Anda: Itthi (female), Purisa (male), and Napusaka (neuter). There are three types of Pota: Itthi (female), Purisa (male), and Napusaka (neuter). Those that arise from the Samucchima are all Napusaka (neuter).

66. [2] What is the nature of the two-sense Tiryancha beings? 

Page #310:
---------------------------
[266] Honey-eating beings (Hanivajiva) are of two types, namely: sufficient two-sensed (Dwindriya) and insufficient two-sensed. This is the statement of the two-sensed non-human beings (Tiryakyonika). Similarly, it should be said for the four-sensed. What are the five-sensed non-human beings? They are of three types, namely: aquatic five-sensed (Jalachar Panchendriya Ti.), terrestrial five-sensed (Sthalachar Panchendriya Ti.) and aerial five-sensed (Khechar Panchendriya Tiryakyonika). What are the aquatic five-sensed non-human beings? They are of two types, namely: those born from eggs (Sammuchhim Jalachar Panchendriya Ti.) and those born from the womb (Garbhavyautkrantik Jalachar Panchendriya Ti.). What are the egg-born aquatic five-sensed non-human beings? They are of two types, namely: sufficient egg-born and insufficient egg-born aquatic five-sensed non-human beings. This is the statement of the egg-born aquatic beings. What are the womb-born aquatic five-sensed non-human beings? They are of two types, namely: sufficient womb-born and insufficient womb-born aquatic five-sensed non-human beings. This is the description of the womb-born aquatic beings. What are the terrestrial five-sensed non-human beings? They are of two types, namely: quadruped terrestrial five-sensed (Chatushpad Sthalachar Panchendriya) and creeping terrestrial five-sensed (Parisarp Sthalachar Panchendriya Tiryakyonika). What are the quadruped terrestrial five-sensed non-human beings? They are of two types, namely: egg-born quadruped terrestrial five-sensed and womb-born quadruped terrestrial five-sensed non-human beings. Just as it was said in the case of aquatic beings, so also these four types should be known. This is the statement of the quadruped terrestrial five-sensed non-human beings. What are the creeping terrestrial five-sensed non-human beings? They are of two types, namely: snake-like creeping terrestrial five-sensed (Urag Parisarp Sthalachar Panchendriya Ti.) and serpent-like creeping terrestrial five-sensed (Bhujag Parisarp Sthalachar Panchendriya Ti.). What are the snake-like creeping terrestrial five-sensed non-human beings? They are of two types, namely: just as the four types of aquatic beings were mentioned, so also they should be mentioned here. Similarly, the four types of serpent-like beings should be mentioned. This is the statement of the serpent-like beings. With this, the statement of the terrestrial five-sensed non-human beings is also complete. What are the aerial five-sensed non-human beings?

## Third Chapter: The Authority of the Transmigratory Beings [267]

There are two types of transmigratory beings, namely, the **Sammūchhim Khechara Panchendriya** and the **Garbhavyutkrāntika Khechara Panchendriya**. What are the **Sammūchhim Khechara Panchendriya**? They are of two types, namely, the **Paryāpta Sammūchhim Khechara Panchendriya** and the **Aparyāpta Sammūchhim Khechara Panchendriya**. The same should be said about the **Garbhavyutkrāntika**.

**O Bhagavan! How many types of Yonisangraha are there for the Khechara Panchendriya Transmigratory Beings?**

**Gautama! There are three types of Yonisangraha, namely, Andaja, Potaja, and Sammūchhim.**

**Andaja are of three types:** Female, Male, and Neuter.

**Potaja are of three types:** Female, Male, and Neuter.

**Sammūchhim are all Neuter.**

**Discussion:** The distinctions of the Transmigratory Beings are established in the scriptures, therefore, there is no need for clarification. Only the clarification of Yonisangraha is as follows:

**Yonisangraha means the distinction made based on the Yoni (birth).**

**The birth of birds is of three types:** Those born from eggs, such as peacocks, etc.; those born from pods, such as wagtails, etc.; and those born from Sammūchhim, such as sparrows, etc.

**Generally, there are four types of Yonisangraha:** 1. Jarāyuja, 2. Andaja, 3. Potaja, and 4. Sammūchhim.

**There is no mention of Jarāyuja in birds. However, excluding Andaja, the rest, both Jarāyuja and Ajarāyuja Garbhaja, are included in Potaja, making three types of Yonisangraha consistent.**

**Andaja are of all three types:** Female, Male, and Neuter.

**Potaja are also of all three genders.**

**Sammūchhim born beings are only Neuter, because their Neuter Veda is definitely manifested.**

**Dvāraprarupaṇā 97. [1] O Bhagavan! How many types of Lesas are there for the Jivas?**

**Gautama! There are six types of Lesas, namely, Kaṇhaleśa to Sukkaleśa.**

**O Bhagavan! Are the Jivas Sammadṛṣṭi, Micchāviṭṭhi, or Sammāmicchāviṭṭhi?**

**Gautama! They are Sammadṛṣṭi, Micchāviṭṭhi, and Sammāmicchāviṭṭhi.**

**O Bhagavan! Are the Jivas Jñānī, Ajñānī?**

**Gautama! They are Jñānī, Ajñānī, and possess three types of Jñāna and three types of Ajñāna.**

**O Bhagavan! Are the Jivas Mana-yogi, Vai-yogi, or Kāya-yogi?**

**Except for Andaja, all other Jarāyuja or Ajarāyuja Garbhavyutkrāntika Panchendriya are included in Potaja. Therefore, three types of Yonisangraha are mentioned, not four.**

**Also, there are no Jarāyuja in birds, therefore, three types of Yonisangraha are mentioned here.**

## Third Chapter: The Authority of the Tiryanch

Gautama! Except for those with countless years of life, those who have attained the state of non-action (akarmabhumi), and those who are in the state of Antarvipi, all beings are born from all places. O Lord! How long is the lifespan of those beings? Gautama! The lifespan of those beings is countless parts of the lowest (jghanya) to the highest (utkrista) Palyopama. 

O Lord! How many Samudghatas (stages of existence) are there for those beings? Gautama! There are five Samudghatas, namely: Vedanasamudghata, etc., up to Taijasasamudghata. 

O Lord! Do those beings die with or without Samvahata (attachment) at the time of death? Gautama! They die both with and without Samvahata. 

O Lord! Where are those beings born after death? Where do they go? Are they born in the Nairyika (hell) or in the Tiryanch (animal) realm? Such questions should be asked. Gautama! As it is said in the Vyutkrantipad (reverse order) of Prajnapanasutra, so it should be said here. (It is said in the second chapter, see there.) 

O Lord! How many lakhs of Yoni-pramukh (species-leading) Jati-kul-koti (species-family-groups) are there for those beings? Gautama! There are twelve lakhs of Yoni-pramukh Jati-kul-koti. 

The clarity of Leshya (color), Drishti (vision), Jnana (knowledge), Yoga (concentration), Upayoga (application), etc., found in the Khechar (birds) is evident from the original text. 

The Udvartana (evolution) should be understood from the Vyutkrantipad. This information is given here. The Vyutkrantipad is in the Prajnapanasutra, and the Udvartana mentioned there should be understood here. This is explained in the second chapter of this Jivaabhigamsutra, which the inquisitive can also see. This Sutra states that there are twelve lakhs of Yoni-pramukh Jati-kul-koti for Khechar. 

The gross example of Jati-kul-yoni has been explained by the ancient teachers as follows: Jati means Tiryanch-jati (animal species), its Kul (family) are Krimi (worms), Kiit (insects), Vrishchik (scorpions), etc. 

These Kul are Yoni-pramukh, meaning there are many Kul in one Yoni. For example, in the six-fold Yoni, there are Krimi-kul, Koti-kul, Vrishchik-kul, etc. Alternatively, 'Jati-kul' can be considered as one word. 

The difference between Jati-kul and Yoni is that there are many Jati-kul in one Yoni. For example, in the same six-fold Yoni, there are Krimi-jati-kul, Kiit-jati-kul, and Vrishchik-jati-kul, etc. Thus, due to the difference in species within the same Yoni, there are many Yoni-pramukh Jati-kul. 

Regarding the Dvaras (gates), the Sangrahini (collection) verse is as follows: 

Yoni-sangrah, Leshya, Ditti, Naane, Ya, Yog, Upayoga, Uvvaaya, Thii, Samudghata, Chayan, Jati-kul-vihi. 

This Sutra discusses Yoni-sangrah, Leshya, Drishti, Jnana, Yoga, Upayoga, Uvvaaya, Thii, Samudghata, Chayan, and Jati-kul-koti.

O Bhagavan! How many types of Yonisangraha are there for the Bhujparisarp sthala chara Panchendriya Tiryanch Yoni? Gautama! There are three types of Yonisangraha, namely Andaja, Potaja and Sammuchhima  /  Just as it is said for the Khacharya, it should be said here as well. The special feature is - their state is Jghanya Antarmuhurt and Utkrishta Purvakoti  /  They die and go to all four gatis  /  When they go to Naraka, they go to the second Prithvi  /  Their nine lakh Jatikulkodi are said  /  The rest is as before  /  O Bhagavan! How many types of Yonisangraha are there for the Urparisarp sthala chara Panchendriya Tiryanch Yoni? This question should be asked. Gautama! Just as the Bhujparisarp is said, it should be said here as well  /  The special feature is

## Third Classification: Gandhaanga Praroopana

[271] Their state is inferior to Antarmukhoorta and superior to the first category of the excellent. If they die and go to hell, they go to the fifth earth. They have ten lakh Jaatikulkodi.

**Question:** Gautam! What is the Yonisangraha of the quadruped terrestrial five-sense Tiryaakyonika?

**Answer:** Gautam! Their Yonisangraha is of two types, namely Jarayuja (Potaj) and Sammoochhima. Jarayuja are of three types, namely female, male, and eunuch. Those who are Sammoochhima are all eunuchs.

**Question:** O Bhagavan! How many Leshya are said for those beings?

**Answer:** Gautam! It should be said like all the Khechara. The special feature is that their state is inferior to Antarmukhoorta and superior to three Palyopama. If they die and go to hell, they go to the fourth hell earth. They have ten lakh Jaatikulkodi.

**Question:** Gautam! What is the Yonisangraha of the aquatic five-sense Tiryaakyonika?

**Answer:** Gautam! It should be said like the Bhujparisho. The special feature is that if they die and go to hell, they go to the seventh earth. They have twelve and a half lakh Jaatikulkodi.

**Question:** O Bhagavan! How many Jaatikulkodi are said for the four-sense beings?

**Answer:** Gautam! Nine lakh Jaatikulkodi are said.

**Question:** O Bhagavan! How many Jaatikulkodi are said for the three-sense beings?

**Answer:** Gautam! Eight lakh Jaatikulkodi are said.

**Question:** O Bhagavan! How many Jaatikulkodi are said for the two-sense beings?

**Answer:** Gautam! Seven lakh Jaatikulkodi are said.

**Discussion:** All other statements are established by the text. Only the Yonisangraha of the quadruped terrestrial five-sense Tiryaakyonika is said to be of two types, namely Potaj and Sammoochhima. Here, in Potaj, all the Jarayuja or Ajarayuja Garbhaja beings, other than the egg-born, are included. Therefore, two types of Yonisangraha are said. Otherwise, cow etc. are Jarayuja and snake etc. are egg-born - these two types and one Sammoochhima, thus three types of Yonisangraha are said. But here only two types are said, therefore, in Potaj, all Jarayuja and Ajarayuja Garbhaja should be understood.

Up to this point, the statement of Jaatikulkodi of Yoni-jatiya was made. Now, the opportunity for different jatiya has arrived, therefore, the Praroopana of different jatiya Gandhaanga is done.

**Gandhaanga Praroopana 98:**

**Question:** O Bhanta! What is the Gandha Panna?

**Answer:** O Bhanta! What is the Gandhasaya Panna?

**Answer:** Gautam! The Gandha and Gandhasaya Panna are seven.

**Question:** O Bhanta! How many Pushpajaatikulkodi Joonipa-muha-sayasahassa are there?

**Answer:** Gautam! Sixteen Pushpajaatikulkodi Joonipa-muha-sayasahassa are there, namely four Jalayaana, four Thalayaana, four Maharakhkiyaana, and four Mahaguummiyaana. But those who are Ajar...

## Third Chapter: Classification of Fragrant Substances [273 /

The Lord said, "Gautama! There are seven fragrant substances (gandhang) and seven hundred sub-species of gandhang. Broadly, the seven gandhang are as follows: 1. Root, 2. Bark, 3. Wood, 4. Exudate, 5. Leaf, 6. Flower, and 7. Fruit.

"Musta, Valuka, Usira, etc. are derived from the word 'root'. Suvarna Chhal (gold bark), etc. are barks. Chandan, Agaru, etc. are derived from wood. Kapoor, etc. are exudates. From leaves, we have Jatipatra, Tamalpatra, etc. From flowers, we have Priyangu, Nagar, etc.

"From fruits, we have Jaiphal, Ilayachi, Laung, etc. These are the seven gandhang in a broad sense.

"When these seven gandhang are multiplied by five colors, we get thirty-five varieties. These are fragrant, so when multiplied by one (35 x 1 = 35), we get thirty-five varieties. In each color variety, five tastes are found due to the difference in substances. Therefore, multiplying the aforementioned 35 by 5, we get 175 (35 x 5 = 175).

"There are texts that mention touch, but in the aforementioned gandhang, only four touches - Mad, Lagha, Sheet, and Ushna - are considered in practice. Therefore, multiplying the aforementioned 175 varieties by 4, we get 700 (175 x 4 = 700) sub-species of gandhang."

After this, a question was asked about the total number of flower species. In response, the Lord said, "There are 16 lakh (1.6 million) species of flowers.

"There are four lakh (400,000) species of flowers that grow in water, such as lotus. There are four lakh (400,000) species of land-based flowers, such as Korant. There are four lakh (400,000) species of flowers from large trees, such as Mahua. And there are four lakh (400,000) species of flowers from large shrubs, such as Jati.

"In this way, sixteen lakh (1.6 million) species of flowers have been counted. There are four types of creepers and four hundred sub-species. There are four types of creepers in the original sense, and four hundred types due to sub-species variations. The four types are not clearly available.

"The original commentator also did not clarify them. There are one hundred types of creepers in the original sense and one hundred sub-species. There are three types of green plants in the original sense and three hundred sub-species. There are three types of green plants: aquatic, terrestrial, and amphibious. Each has one hundred sub-species, therefore, three hundred sub-species of green plants are mentioned.

"There are said to be a thousand types of fruits with seeds, such as brinjal, and a thousand types of fruits with a stalk. All these three hundred types and others, as well as all types of fruits, etc., are found under green plants.

"1. Root, bark, wood, exudate, leaf, flower, and fruit are the gandhang. They are to be understood by their color and other differences, as well as their fragrance and taste. // 1 //

"This is the explanation in two verses: Musta, Suvarna Chhal, Agaru, Valuka, Tamalpatra, etc. are gandhang. // 1 //

"Multiplying by seven hundred, by five colors, by fragrance, by taste, and by touch, we get the varieties. // 2 //"

## Translation:

[274] The **Jīvānīvāmigamasūtra** states that the **haritakāya** (green-bodied) belongs to the **vanaspatikāya** (plant body), which in turn is part of the **sthāvarakāya** (stationary body). The **sthāvarakāya** is further included within the **jīva** (living beings). Thus, according to the sūtra, through self-understanding, understanding from others, contemplation through **arthālochanā** (interpretation), deep thinking through **yukti** (reasoning), and **pūrvāpara** (previous and subsequent) examination, all worldly beings are categorized into these two categories: **sakāya** (having a body) and **sthāvarakāya** (stationary body).

In this context, one should understand the **prājīva** (living being) analogy. Just as the term "**jīva**" encompasses all **tras** (mobile beings), **sthāvar** (stationary beings), **sūkṣma-bādar** (subtle and gross), **paryāpta-aparyāpta** (sufficient and insufficient), and **ṣaṭkāya** (six categories of beings), similarly, one should understand that all beings in the world are included within these 84 lakh (8.4 million) **jīvayonīs** (types of births).

The mention of 84 lakh **yonīs** here is merely an indication. One should understand other **jātikulkoṭi** (categories of birth) as well. For example, there are 12 lakh birds, 9 lakh **bhujaparisaṛpa** (reptiles with limbs), 10 lakh **urparisaṛpa** (reptiles without limbs), 10 lakh quadrupeds, 12.5 lakh aquatic animals, 1 lakh **caturindriya** (four-sensed beings), 8 lakh **trīndriya** (three-sensed beings), 7 lakh **dvīndriya** (two-sensed beings), and 16 lakh **puṣpajāti** (flower-born beings). Combining these, we get 33.5 lakh. Therefore, the mention of 84 lakh **yonīs** here is merely an indication; there are other **kulkoṭi** (categories) as well.

Elsewhere, **kulkoṭi** are listed as follows: 12 lakh **pṛthvīkāya** (earth-bodied), 7 lakh **apkāya** (water-bodied), 3 lakh **tejasakāya** (fire-bodied), 7 lakh **vāyukāya** (air-bodied), 7 lakh **dvīndriya** (two-sensed), 8 lakh **trīndriya** (three-sensed), 9 lakh **caturindriya** (four-sensed), 12.5 lakh **jalacāra** (aquatic), 10 lakh **sthalačara** (terrestrial), 12 lakh **khečara** (aerial), 10 lakh **urparisaṛpa** (reptiles without limbs), 9 lakh **bhujaparisaṛpa** (reptiles with limbs), 25 lakh **nāraka** (hell beings), 26 lakh **devatā** (deities), and 12 lakh **manuṣya** (humans). In total, there are 1 crore 57 lakh (15.7 million) **kulkoṭi**.

The calculation of 84 lakh **jīvayonīs** can also be understood in this way: there are 32 lakh **yonīs** for **tras** (mobile beings). This is broken down as follows: 2 lakh **dvīndriya** (two-sensed), 2 lakh **trīndriya** (three-sensed), 2 lakh **caturindriya** (four-sensed), 4 lakh **tiryapanceṇdriya** (five-sensed animals), 4 lakh **nāraka** (hell beings), 4 lakh **dev** (deities), and 14 lakh **manuṣya** (humans). These total 32 lakh **yonīs** for **tras** (mobile beings).

There are 52 lakh **yonīs** for **sthāvar** (stationary beings): 7 lakh **pṛthvīkāya** (earth-bodied), 7 lakh **apkāya** (water-bodied), 7 lakh **tejasakāya** (fire-bodied), 7 lakh **vāyukāya** (air-bodied), and 24 lakh **vanaspati** (plants). This totals 52 lakh **yonīs** for **sthāvar** (stationary beings).

Combining 32 lakh **tras** (mobile beings) and 52 lakh **sthāvar** (stationary beings), we get 84 lakh **jīvayonīs** (types of births).

Regarding **vimāna** (celestial vehicles), the question is: 99. **Asthi** (Venerable Sir), what are the **vimāna** (celestial vehicles) like in terms of **sotthiya** (excellence)? What is their **sotthiya-vattai** (excellence of form), **sotthiya-prabhāi** (excellence of radiance), **sotthiya-kantāi** (excellence of beauty), **sotthiya-vannāi** (excellence of color), **sotthiya-lesāi** (excellence of decoration), **sotthiya-jžžayāi** (excellence of sound), **sotthiya-singārāi** (excellence of adornment), **sotthiya-kaḍāi** (excellence of construction), **sotthiya-siṭṭāi** (excellence of arrangement), and **sotthiya-uttaradisagāi** (excellence of direction)?

**Asthi** (Venerable Sir): 1. According to the **ṭīkākara** (commentator), the reading is "**acchiain pracchiyavattai**" etc.

[Question about Vimanas] [275]  "How big are the Vimanas called Swastika, Swastikavarta, Swastikaprabha, Swastikakanta, Swastikavarna, Swastikaleshya, Swastikadhvaja, Swastikashringara, Swastikakuta, Swastikashishta and Swastikottaravatansaka?" "Gotama, they are." "How big are they, Bhagavan?" "Gotama, the distance from which the sun rises and the distance from which the sun sets (this is one Avasantarai), three such Avasantarai-sized areas constitute one Vikrama (pace) of a Deva.

## Third Understanding: Questions about the Vimanas [277]

On the first day of the Kark Sankranti, the most auspicious day in Jambudvipa, the sun appears to rise from a distance of forty-seven thousand two hundred sixty yojanas and one yojana divided into six parts (twenty-one sixtieth parts). 47263 1/10 yojanas is the extent of its rising point, and the same is the extent of its setting point. The rising point and the setting point together make a total of 94526 1/10 yojanas. This is the extent of one Avashaantar. Since there are three such Avashaantars, the total extent of one padanyas of that deva is twenty-eight lakh three thousand five hundred eighty yojanas and one yojana divided into sixty parts (28,03,580 1/60). 

Even if a deva with such strength were to walk continuously for one day, two days, or even for the auspicious six months, he would still be able to cross some of those Vimanas, but not others. These Vimanas are so large. This is a simile to understand the greatness of Vimanas like Swastika, etc. 

In response to the question about the greatness of Achi, Achirawart, etc., one should know the same, except that here, the extent of one padanyas of that deva should be understood as five Avashaantars. 

In the case of Kama, Kamawart, etc., Vimanas, one should also know the same, except that the extent of one padanyas of that deva should be understood as seven Avashaantars. 

The same should be known about Vijay, Vaijayant, Jayant, and Aparajit. The difference is that here, the extent of one padanyas of that deva should be understood as nine Avashaantars. O venerable Shraman! These Vimanas are so large. 

## First Tiryaak Uddeshak Complete

1. **Javi Udai Suro Javi So Athamei Avarenam / Tiyapanasattanavgunam Kaun Patteyem Patteyem // 1 //**
   - The sun rises and sets in the same way. The distance is to be understood as three times seven times nine times the Kaun. 

2. **Siyalis Sahasssa Do Ya Saya Joyanaana Tebatta / Igavis Sadvibhaga Kakkhadamaimmi Pechch Nara // 2 //**
   - Forty-two thousand two hundred yojanas and twenty-one sixtieth parts are seen by humans in the Kakkhadamaimmi.

3. **Evam Dugunam Kaun Gunijjae Tiyapanasattamaaihim / Magayphalem Cha Jam Tam Kamparimanam Biyaanahi // 3 //**
   - Multiply the Kaun by two and then by three times seven. The result is the extent of the Kama.

4. **Chattari Vi Sakammehi, Chandaigaihim Janti Chhammas / Tahavi Ya Na Janti Param Kesinchhi Sura Vimanaai // 4 //**
   - Even if they walk for six months with all their strength and speed, even then, some devas cannot cross some Vimanas.

## Third Classification: Specific Information about Earth-bodied Beings [279]

There are two types of subtle earth-bodied beings: sufficient and insufficient. This is the statement about subtle earth-bodied beings. What are coarse earth-bodied beings? There are two types of coarse earth-bodied beings: sufficient and insufficient. Thus, as stated in the *Prajnapana* text, one should say. There are seven types of smooth (soft) earth-bodied beings and many types of rough earth-bodied beings, even countless. This is the statement about coarse earth-bodied beings. This is the statement about earth-bodied beings. Thus, as stated in the *Prajnapana* text, one should make the complete statement. The same should be said about plant-bodied beings, where there may be a countable number, an uncountable number, or an infinite number of plant-bodied beings. This is the statement about coarse plant-bodied beings. This is the statement about plant-bodied beings. What are embodied beings? They are said to be of four types: two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, and five-sensed. What are two-sensed beings? They are said to be of many types. Thus, as stated in the *Prajnapana* text, one should make the complete statement until the authority of the *Sarvarthasiddha* gods is reached. This is the statement about the *Anuttaropapatika* gods. Along with this, there is the statement about the gods, the statement about the five-sensed beings, and the complete statement about embodied beings.

**Discussion:** Here, the intention of the teachers who state that there are six types of beings who end their cycle of existence is explained. 1. Earth-bodied, 2. Water-bodied, 3. Fire-bodied, 4. Air-bodied, 5. Plant-bodied, and 6. Stationary-bodied - all worldly beings are included in these six categories. In this context, everything that was said in the previous classifications of stationary and immobile beings has been said. Therefore, one should know the statement according to the statement made in the first verse of the *Prajnapana* sutra, as the sutra-maker has provided information here. Inquisitive people can obtain specific information from there.

## Third Chapter: Specific Information Regarding Earth-bodied Beings [281 Discussions]

This sutra presents several specific topics related to Earth-bodied beings, etc. To address these, questions about Earth are asked again. 

In response to a question about the types of Earth, the Lord said that there are six types of Earth:

1. **Shlakshnaprithvi:** This refers to soft, smooth soil. It is as soft as powdered flour.
2. **Shuddhaprithvi:** The soil found in the middle of mountains, etc., is Shuddhaprithvi.
3. **Balukaprithvi:** Fine sand is Balukaprithvi.
4. **Manahshilaprithvi:** Manahshila, etc., is Manahshilaprithvi.
5. **Sharkaraprithvi:** Gravel, pebbles, etc., are Sharkaraprithvi.
6. **Kharaprithvi:** Stony Earth is Kharaprithvi.

After describing these six types of Earth, questions were asked about their duration. The answer stated:

1. **Shlakshnaprithvi:** Its minimum duration is an Antarmuhurta and its maximum duration is one thousand years.
2. **Shuddhaprithvi:** Its minimum duration is an Antarmuhurta and its maximum duration is twelve thousand years.
3. **Balukaprithvi:** Its minimum duration is an Antarmuhurta and its maximum duration is fourteen thousand years.
4. **Manahshilaprithvi:** Its minimum duration is an Antarmuhurta and its maximum duration is sixteen thousand years.
5. **Sharkaraprithvi:** Its minimum duration is an Antarmuhurta and its maximum duration is eighteen thousand years.
6. **Kharaprithvi:** Its minimum duration is an Antarmuhurta and its maximum duration is twenty-two thousand years.

**Earth Duration Chart:**

| Earth Type | Minimum Duration | Maximum Duration |
|---|---|---|
| Shlakshnaprithvi | Antarmuhurta | One thousand years |
| Shuddhaprithvi | Antarmuhurta | Twelve thousand years |
| Balukaprithvi | Antarmuhurta | Fourteen thousand years |
| Manahshilaprithvi | Antarmuhurta | Sixteen thousand years |
| Sharkaraprithvi | Antarmuhurta | Eighteen thousand years |
| Kharaprithvi | Antarmuhurta | Twenty-two thousand years |

Since the topic of duration is being discussed, questions arise about the duration of Nairyikas, etc., in the order of the twenty-four Dandakas. These questions and their answers should be understood according to the fourth position of the Prajnapanapad, up to the duration of the Devas of Sarvarthasiddha. There is a detailed description of duration there. Therefore, instead of mentioning it here, it is suggested to refer to that section.

After discussing the topic of duration of existence, questions arise about the duration of the body. 

**[Verse 1]**

"Shlakshna, Shuddha, Baluka, Manahshila, Sharkara, and Kharaprithvi. These have durations of twelve, fourteen, sixteen, eighteen, and twenty-two thousand years respectively."

## 282] [The Sutra on the Approach of the Soul (Jiva) remains / The meaning of "Kayasthiti" is - to remain in the general or specific form of the soul, which is the intended synonym / In "Bhavasthiti," the state of the present existence is assumed, and in "Kayasthiti," the state is intended as long as the soul remains with its life-form synonym! In the present context, the Kayasthiti of the soul is asked. The one who sustains life is the soul. There are two types of life - Dravya-pran and Bhava-pran / Five senses, mind-speech-body these three forces, lifespan and breathing, these ten are Dravya-pran, and knowledge, perception, happiness, and vitality, these four are Bhava-pran / Here, both types of life are taken / Therefore, the meaning of the question is - how long does the soul remain in the form of life, in terms of sustaining life? The Lord answered that the soul remains in the form of life for all time. It remains alive in the worldly state by taking Dravya-Bhava-pran, and in the liberated state by taking Bhava-pran. Therefore, it remains in the form of life for all time. There is not a single moment when the soul is devoid of this state of life / Or, the word "Jiva" here does not refer to a specific soul, but to the soul in general / Therefore, there is no fault in considering life-sustaining as the characteristic of the soul. That is, the soul remains in the form of the soul. It has always lived, lives, and will continue to live. Thus, Kayasthiti is said in relation to the general soul, taking the soul / Similarly, in the case of the Earth-body (Prithvi-kaya) etc., the general meaning should be understood. The Earth-body will also always remain in the form of the Earth-body, generally, there will never be a time when there will be no Earth-bodied beings. Therefore, their Kayasthiti is said to be for all time / Thus, the way Kayasthiti is said in the eighteenth "Kayasthiti" word of the understanding through the doors of motion, senses, body, etc., should be said here / These doors are twenty-two: 1. Soul, 2. Motion, 3. Senses, 4. Body, 5. Yoga, 6. Vedas, 7. Passions, 8. Leshya, 9. Rightness, 10. Knowledge, 11. Perception, 12. Restraint, 13. Use, 14. Food, 15. Speaker, 16. Protection, 17. Sufficient, 18. Subtle, 19. Knower, 20. Existence-Proving, 21. Existing-Body, and 22. Ultimate / Thus, the Sutras related to Water-body (Ap), Fire-body (Tejas), Air-body (Vayu), Plant-body (Vanaspati), and Animal-body (Trasa-kaya) should also be understood like the Earth-body. The statement related to the non-attachment is 101-2. "O Venerable! For how long is the Earth-body (Padappanna-puthvikaiya)?" "Go-yama! As many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm, as many times as there are countless births and deaths in the hellish realm

[Third Chapter: Statement Regarding Nilapa] [283] "Venerable one! How long does it take for a newly arisen earth-bodied being to become nilapa?" "Gautama! For a newly arisen earth-bodied being, it takes an innumerable number of utsarpini and avasarpini kalpas, both in the inferior and superior positions. For a newly arisen earth-bodied being, there is no nilapa." "Venerable one! How long does it take for a newly arisen plant-bodied being to become nilapa?" "Gautama! For newly arisen plant-bodied beings, it cannot be said that they become nilapa in a certain amount of time, in either the inferior or superior positions. These beings cannot become nilapa." "Venerable one! How long does it take for a newly arisen water-bodied being to become nilapa?" "Gautama! For a newly arisen water-bodied being, it takes a time equal to a hundred times the size of the ocean, both in the inferior and superior positions. It should be understood that there is a significant difference between the inferior and superior positions."

## 284] [Jiva-jiva-abhigamsutra] _ In the same way, one should understand the nirlepanā of the newly arisen apkāyika, tejaskāyika, and vāyukāyika jivas. In response to the question regarding the nirlepanā of newly arisen vanaspatikāyika jivas, it has been said that their nirlepanā is not possible in either the jghanyapada or the utkrishtpada. Because these jivas are anantananta / Therefore, it is not possible to say "they will become nirlipta or apahrita in this much time" / They cannot be said by the above-mentioned pada, therefore they are called 'ayada'. The time of nirlepanā for newly arisen trasakāyika jivas is sāgaropamashatapṛthaktva in the jghanyapada, meaning that their apahara is possible in a time ranging from two hundred sāgaropamas to nine hundred sāgaropamas / The same sāgaropamashatapṛthaktva should be known as the time of nirlepanā in the utkrishtpada, but this time mentioned in the utkrishtpada should be known as being more special than the time mentioned in the jghanyapada / The statement of the anāgāra with avisuddha-visuddha leshyā is 103. "Bhante! Does the anāgāra, with his own asamoha, know and see the avisuddha-leshyā deva-devi anāgāra?" "Go-yama! No, it is not so." "Bhante! Does the anāgāra, with his own asamoha, know and see the visuddha-leshyā deva-devi anāgāra?" "Go-yama! No, it is not so." "Bhante!

## Third Proposition: Statement of the Ascetic with Impure Leshya

(285) "Does the Ascetic with Impure Leshya know and see the Dev, Devi, and Ascetic with Impure Leshya through a soul free from the defilement of pain, etc.?  Gautama! This meaning is not supported, i.e., he does not know or see."

(103) "Does the Ascetic with Impure Leshya know and see the Dev, Devi, and Ascetic with Pure Leshya through a soul free from the defilement of pain, etc.? Gautama! This meaning is not supported."

"Does the Ascetic with Impure Leshya know and see the Dev, Devi, and Ascetic with Impure Leshya through a soul with the defilement of pain, etc.? Gautama! This meaning is not supported."

"Does the Ascetic with Impure Leshya know and see the Dev, Devi, and Ascetic with Impure Leshya through a soul with the defilement of pain, etc.? Gautama! This meaning is not correct."

"Does the Ascetic with Impure Leshya know and see the Dev, Devi, and Ascetic with Impure Leshya through a soul that is neither completely free from the defilement of pain, etc., nor completely bound by it? Gautama! This meaning is not supported."

"Does the Ascetic with Impure Leshya know and see the Dev, Devi, and Ascetic with Pure Leshya through a soul that is both bound and unbound? Gautama! This meaning is not supported."

"Does the Ascetic with Pure Leshya know and see the Dev, Devi, and Ascetic with Impure Leshya through a soul that is unbound by the defilement of pain, etc.? Yes, Gautama! He knows and sees."

"Just as six Palapas are mentioned for the Ascetic with Impure Leshya, so too six Palapas should be mentioned for the Ascetic with Pure Leshya. Does the Ascetic with Pure Leshya know and see the Dev, Devi, and Ascetic with Pure Leshya through a soul that is both bound and unbound? Yes, Gautama! He knows and sees."

"In the previous Sutra, the state of being and the absence of defilement, etc., were mentioned. The Ascetic with Pure Leshya understands this statement correctly, while the Ascetic with Impure Leshya does not understand it correctly..."

---------------------------
[286] [The text from the Jiva-Jiva-Migam Sutra does not explain this. / In this context, questions related to knowledge and perception have been raised regarding the Angara with pure Leshya and the Angara with impure Leshya. Impure Leshya refers to Krishna-Neela-Kapota Leshya. Asamvahat means devoid of suffering and other disturbances, and Samvahat means having suffering and other disturbances. / Samvahat-Asamvahat means neither completely having nor completely devoid of suffering and other disturbances. / Regarding the Angara with impure Leshya, six Palapakas have been stated as follows: (1) Knowing the Devadi with impure Leshya while being Asamvahat, (2) Knowing the Devadi with pure Leshya while being Asamvahat, (3) Knowing the Devadi with impure Leshya while being Samvahat, (4) Knowing the Devadi with pure Leshya while being Samvahat, (5) Knowing the Devadi with impure Leshya while being Samvahat-Asamvahat, (6) Knowing the Devadi with pure Leshya while being Samvahat-Asamvahat. / In all these six Palapakas, knowing and seeing the Angara with impure Leshya is prohibited. Because due to impure Leshya, that Angara does not know or see any object correctly. Regarding the Angara with pure Leshya, six Palapakas should be stated in the same way as mentioned above, and in all of them, knowing and seeing the Devadi objects should be stated. The Angara with pure Leshya knows and sees objects correctly. / Due to pure Leshya, there is correct knowledge and perception, otherwise not. The original commentator has said that the Angara with pure Leshya knows the beautiful or ugly object in its true form. / Suffering is not an obstacle for him. / His suffering is also not extremely ugly. The implication is that the Angara with impure Leshya does not know or see objects in the right perspective, while the Angara with pure Leshya knows and sees objects correctly. 

104. "Annuthiya Nam, Bante! They think this way, they speak this way, they understand this way, they perceive this way. / And indeed, a single Jiva performs two actions at the same time, such as - Sammattakriya and Micchattkriya. / When he performs Sammattakriya, he also performs Micchattkriya, and when he performs Micchattkriya, he also performs Sammattakriya. / Due to the performance of Sammattakriya, he performs Micchattkriya, and due to the performance of Micchattkriya, he performs Sammattakriya." 

Page #331:
---------------------------
## Third Proposition: The impossibility of simultaneous Samyak-Kriya and Mithya-Kriya

[287] The other-worldly ones say, speak, explain, and declare that "one being performs two actions at the same time, Samyak-Kriya and Mithya-Kriya. When they perform Samyak-Kriya, they also perform Mithya-Kriya, and when they perform Mithya-Kriya, they also perform Samyak-Kriya. They perform Mithya-Kriya while performing Samyak-Kriya, and they perform Samyak-Kriya while performing Mithya-Kriya. Thus, one being performs two actions at the same time, namely Samyak-Kriya and Mithya-Kriya."

O Bhagavan! What is the nature of their statement?

O Gautama! Those other-worldly ones who say, speak, explain, and declare that one being performs two actions at the same time, Samyak-Kriya and Mithya-Kriya, are speaking falsely.

O Gautama! I say and declare that one being performs only one action at a time, either Samyak-Kriya or Mithya-Kriya. When they perform Samyak-Kriya, they do not perform Mithya-Kriya, and when they perform Mithya-Kriya, they do not perform Samyak-Kriya. They do not perform Mithya-Kriya while performing Samyak-Kriya, and they do not perform Samyak-Kriya while performing Mithya-Kriya. Thus, one being performs only one action at a time, either Samyak-Kriya or Mithya-Kriya.

This is the second refutation of the Tiryanch-yonik authority. [104]

**Discussion:** This sutra refutes the belief of the other-worldly ones that a being can perform both Samyak-Kriya and Mithya-Kriya simultaneously. The other-worldly ones state, elaborate, explain, and firmly declare that "one being performs both Samyak-Kriya and Mithya-Kriya at the same time." 

Page #332:
---------------------------
[288] The *jivajivaabhigamsutra* exists and also performs *mithyakriya*. The action with beautiful *adhyavasaya* is *samyakriya* and the action with ugly *adhyavasaya* is *mithyakriya*. At the time when the *jiva* performs *samyakriya*, it also performs *mithyakriya*, and at the time when it performs *mithyakriya*, it also performs *samyakriya*. Because the nature of the *jiva* is to perform both actions. The *jiva* has the nature of performing both actions in a combined form. Therefore, whatever good or bad action the *jiva* is inclined towards, its nature of performing both actions remains present. Due to the nature of performing both actions, its action is also of both forms. When milk and water are mixed, it must be called of both forms, not one form. Therefore, at the time when the *jiva* is performing *samyakriya*, the tendency of its nature of performing both actions is also happening, otherwise, the tendency cannot be complete. Due to the tendency of the nature of performing both actions, at the time when *samyakriya* is happening, *mithyakriya* is also happening, and at the time when *mithyakriya* is happening, *samyakriya* is also happening. Therefore, a *jiva* can perform both actions at the same time - *samyakriya* and *mithyakriya*. The belief of these *anyatheethikas* is false. The Lord says, "O Gautama! A *jiva* can perform only one action at a time - *samyakriya* or *mithyakriya*. It cannot perform both actions together because there is mutual avoidance and opposition between them. If *samyakriya* is happening, then *mithyakriya* cannot happen, and if *mithyakriya* is happening, then *samyakriya* cannot happen. The *jiva* does not have the nature of performing both actions. If the nature of performing both actions is assumed, then *mithyatva* will never cease, and in such a situation, there will be a lack of liberation. Therefore, it is proven that when performing *samyakriya*, it does not perform *mithyakriya*, and when performing *mithyakriya*, it does not perform *samyakriya*. *Samyakriya* and *mithyakriya* leave each other, they cannot exist together. Therefore, this is the correct principle that a *jiva* can perform only one action at a time - *samyakriya* or *mithyakriya*, both actions are never possible together. // The second *uddeshaka* in the *tiryakyonika* authority of the third *pratipatti* ends. //

After discussing the rights of the Tiryanchikas in the third chapter, now the rights of humans, which are in order, are discussed. Its first sutra is 105. "What are humans?" "Humans are of two types, namely: 1. Sammuchhima humans and 2. Garbhavyutkrantika humans." [105] "O Bhagavan! How many types of humans are there?" "Gautama! Humans are of two types, namely: 1. Sammuchhima humans and 2. Garbhavyutkrantika humans." [105] "O Bhagavan! How many types of Sammuchhima humans are there?" "Gautama! Sammuchhima humans are of only one type." "O Bhagavan! Where are these Sammuchhima humans born?" "Gautama! In the human realm (born in 14 impure places), etc., as described in the Prajnapanasutra, should be said here completely until the discussion of Sammuchhima humans is complete." Discussion: The Prajnapanasutra's first chapter provides a detailed description of the 14 impure places of birth of Sammuchhima humans and their lifespan of only a few moments, etc. This has already been discussed in the second chapter of this Jeevajeevaabhigamsutra. [106] The curious can refer to it. [106] "O Bhagavan! How many types of Garbhavyutkrantika humans are there?" "Gautama! Garbhavyutkrantika humans are of three types, namely: 1. Karmabhumika, 2. Akarmabhumika, and 3. Prantípika." [107]

## 29.] [Jīvā Jīvābhigama Sūtra 108. How many types of Antaradīvaga are there? Antaradīvaga are twenty-eight types, such as - Ekoruk, Ābhāṣik, Vaiṣāṇik, Nāngolik, Hayakarna etc., Ādarshamukha etc., Aśvamukha etc., Aśvakarna etc., Ukkamukha etc., Ghanadanta etc., up to Śuddhadanta. [108]  O Bhagavan! How many types of Prāntīpik humans are there? Gautama! Prāntīpik are twenty-eight types, such as - Ekoruk, Ābhāṣik, Vaiṣāṇik, Nāngolik, Hayakarna etc., Ādarshamukha etc., Aśvamukha etc., Aśvakarna etc., Ukkamukha etc., Ghanadanta etc., up to Śuddhadanta.

**Explanation:** In the present Sūtras, after mentioning the three types of Garbhaja humans - Karmabhūmik, Akarmabhūmik and Antarvīpik, it is also mentioned in an unsequential manner (astyānānupūyampi), i.e., in a non-sequential order. Based on this principle, questions and answers have been given regarding Antaradīpik. Due to the presence of islands within islands inside the salt ocean, they are called Antaradīp, and the humans residing in them are called Antarapik based on the principle of "Tātsthyāt Tavyapadeshaḥ", just like the men residing in Punjab are called Punjabis. Prāntīpik humans are of twenty-eight types, namely: 1. Ekoruk, 2. Ābhāṣik, 3. Vaiṣāṇik, 4. Nāngolik, 5. Hayakarna, 6. Gajakarna, 7. Gokarna, 8. Śaṣkulikarna, 9. Prādarshamukha, 10. Meṇḍhamukha, 11. Ayomukha, 12. Gomukha, 13. Aśvamukha, 14. Hastimukha, 15. Simhamukha, 16. Vyāghramukha, 17. Aśvakarna, 18. Simhakara, 19. Akara, 20. Karṇaprāvaraṇa, 21. Ukkamukha, 22. Meghamukha, 23. Vidyutdanta, 24. Vidyujjihva, 25. Dhanadanta, 26. Laṣṭadanta, 27. Gūḍhadanta and 28. Śuddhadanta. The humans residing in these islands are also known by the same name. The detailed description of these Prāntīpik is given in the following Sūtras. The description of the Ekoruk island of the Ekoruk humans is given in 109.

**109.** O Bhagavan! Where is the island called Ekoruk, the abode of the Ekoruk humans in the southern direction?

---------------------------
## Third Chapter: Description of the Ekoruk Island of the Ekoruk Humans

[291] O Gautama! South of Mount Meru in Jambudvipa, three hundred yojanas into the salt sea from the extreme northeast of the Chull (Ksulla) Himavan mountain, a landmass called Ekoruk Island is said to be the home of the Ekoruk humans. This island is three hundred yojanas in length and breadth, and its circumference is slightly more than nine hundred and fifty yojanas. It is surrounded by a Padmavaravedika and a forest. This Padmavaravedika is eight yojanas high, five hundred dhanus wide, and encircles the Ekoruk Island on all sides. The description of this Padmavaravedika is as follows: its foundation is made of vajra, etc. The description of the vedika should be understood as in the Rajaprashniyasutra.

The discussion here is about the Ekoruk Island of the Ekoruk humans in the south. The Ekoruk humans are also found on the Shikhari mountain, but they are located in the north of Mount Meru. The adjective "in the south" is used here to distinguish them. Where is the Ekoruk Island of the Ekoruk humans in the south? This is the essence of the question. The answer is that this Ekoruk Island of the Ekoruk humans in the south is located three hundred yojanas into the salt sea from the extreme northeast (ishan kona) of the Chull Himavan mountain, south of Mount Meru in Jambudvipa. This Ekoruk Island is three hundred yojanas in length and breadth, and its circumference is slightly more than nine hundred and fifty yojanas. It is surrounded by a Padmavaravedika, and around that, a forest. This Padmavaravedika is eight yojanas high and five hundred dhanus wide. Its description should be understood as the same as the Padmavaravedika described in the Rajaprashniyasutra. For example, its foundation is made of vajra gems, etc.

The description of the Padmavaravedika and the forest should be understood as the same as the description of the Padmavaravedika and the forest in front of the Jagati of Jambudvipa, as described by the Sutrakar himself. Therefore, that description is not given here.

[110] This Padmavaravedika is completely surrounded by a forest. This forest is two yojanas in diameter, with a circumference equal to the vedika. This forest is very green and dense, appearing black and black-colored. The description of this forest should be understood as in the Rajaprashniyasutra. The color, smell, touch, sound of the grass, as well as the wells, the utpataparvat, the earth-stone-slab, etc., should also be described. There are many Vanavyantara Devas and Devis who rise and sit there, and they wander around experiencing happiness. 

Page #336:
---------------------------
[292] Description of the Ekorukdvipa 111. [1] O Bhagavan! How is the land of Ekorukdvipa described? _ Gautama! The inner land of Ekorukdvipa is said to be very flat and beautiful. _ Just as the skin of a Mruj (a type of drum) is flat, so is the land there. _ Similarly, one should also mention the softness of a bed or describe the earth-stone slab. On that stone slab, many men and women of Ekorukdvipa rise and sit, experiencing the fruits of their past good deeds. _ The present sutra describes the land structure of Ekorukdvipa. The land there is perfectly flat. Various similes are used to describe this flatness. _ The sutra explicitly states 'Pralingapukkharei va', which means 'Aaling', meaning Mruj. _ Mruj is a type of drum. _ Pushkar means skin. _ Just as the skin of a Mruj and drum is perfectly flat, so is the land of Ekorukdvipa perfectly flat and beautiful. _ The word 'Yavat' should be understood to include other similes, such as the smooth and flat surface of a drum, the flat surface of water in a full pond, the palm of the hand, the moon, the sun, the surface of a mirror, etc. _ Just as the skin of sheep, bull, deer, lion, tiger, wolf, and cheetah is made extremely flat by stretching it with large nails, so is the land there extremely flat and beautiful. That land is adorned with various auspicious forms like Pravart, Pratyavart, Shreni, Prasreni, Swastik, Sovastik, Pushyaman, Vardhaman, Matsyand, Makarand, Jar Mar Puspavali, Padmapatra, Sagar Tarang, Vasanti Lata, Padmalata, etc., and is beautiful, with beautiful radiance, beautiful splendor, shining bright rays, and light, adorned with various types of five-colored grasses and gems. _ That land is soft to the touch. To describe this soft touch, one should mention the bed. The implication is that the land is soft to the touch like deer skin, cotton, wool, butter, and cotton. _ That land is full of gems, clean, smooth, rubbed, polished, free from stones, pure, spotless, free from pebbles, bright, beautiful, radiant, auspicious, beautiful to look at, and a model.

[Description of the Third Rebirth] [296 There is also a stone slab on the earth, the description of which should be known according to the Propapattikasutra / On that stone slab, many male and female residents of the Ekoruk island rise, sit, lie down, rest and wander, enjoying the fruits of their past good deeds. Description of Trees etc. [2] In the Egosyhove, there are many trees called Uddalak, Koddalak, Kayamala, Nayamala, Pattamala, Singamala, Sankhamala, Dantamala, and Sailmala / These trees are devoid of Kus and Kans at their roots, meaning there is no Kus and Kans around them / They have excellent roots, excellent tubers, and excellent seeds, and are covered with leaves and flowers, meaning they are laden with leaves and flowers, and are extremely beautiful. In the Egoruk island, there are many trees, including Herutalavan, Bherutalavan, Merutalavan, Serutalavan, Salavan, Saralavan, Saptparnavan, Supari forests, date palm forests, and coconut forests / These trees and forests are devoid of Kus and Kans, and are extremely beautiful. In the Egoruk island, there are many Tilaka, Lavaka, Nyagrodha, Rajavriksha, and Nandivriksha, which are devoid of Kus and Kans, and are extremely beautiful. 1.

## Third Rebirth: Description of the Men of the Ekahohaka Island

[307] O Bhagavan! How often do those women desire food? 
Gautama! They desire food every other day, that is, on the fourth day. 

[111] (15) O Bhagavan! What kind of food do those men eat? 
Gautama! Those men of the Manaygana clan eat earth, flowers, and fruits, O Shraman! 

O Bhagavan! What is the taste of that earth? 
Gautama! It tastes like jaggery, sugar candy, sugar, mishri, lotus root, parpatmodak, sugar made from special flowers, sugar made from special lotuses, akositha, vijaya, maha-vijaya, adarshopama, anopma (these are special sweet substances). 

Or, the taste of that earth is like the milk of four cows that have been milked four times and have been fed four times. The milk of these four cows is given to three cows, the milk of these three cows is given to two cows, and the milk of these two cows is given to one cow. The milk of that one cow is called four times transformed and four-fold transformed. 

What is the taste of those flowers and fruits? 
Gautama! The taste of those flowers and fruits is like the taste of a sweet dish made from four times transformed and four-fold transformed sugar candy, prepared with the best ingredients, and served in a forest with a hundred thousand trees, with a fragrant aroma, with a delicious taste, and with a sweet flavor. It is also like the taste of a sweet dish made from twenty, twenty, ten, ten, five, five, two, two, and one times transformed and four-fold transformed sugar candy. 

Is that not so, O Shraman? 

O Bhagavan! Those men of the Manaygana clan live in tree houses, O Shraman! 

O Bhagavan! What are the features of those trees? 
Gautama! Those trees have features like a cage, a viewing room, a roofed room, a hundred features, a feature of a tree, a feature of a gate, a feature of a tower, a feature of a wall, a feature of a balcony, a feature of a passage, a feature of a courtyard, a feature of a well, a feature of a pillar, a feature of a wall, and many other features that are suitable for resting, sleeping, and sitting. Those men of the Manaygana clan live in those trees, O Shraman! 

Page #352:
---------------------------
[308] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra] Is the taste of cow's milk, which has been transformed into a sweet dish by adding jaggery, sugar, and mishri, cooked on a slow fire, and possessing auspicious color, fragrance, taste, and touch, similar to the taste of cow's milk? Gautama! This is not supported. The taste of that earth is even more desirable and pleasing.  /  O Bhagavan! What is the taste of the flowers and fruits there? Gautama! Like the food of the Chaturanga Chakravarti, known as Kalyana Bhojan, which is produced from a lakh cows, which is of the best color, fragrance, taste, and touch, is worthy of tasting, is worthy of tasting again and again, which is deepaniya (digestive), vahaniya (nourishing), darpaneya (enhancing enthusiasm), madaniya (intoxicating), and which is enjoyable to all the senses and the body, is that the taste of those flowers and fruits? Gautama! This is not right. The taste of those flowers and fruits is even more desirable, radiant, dearer, pleasing, and more pleasing. O Bhagavan! How do they live in such dwellings after consuming such food? Ayushman Gautama! Those humans live in trees transformed into houses.  /  Bhagavan! What is the shape of those trees? Gautama! They are shaped like the peak of a mountain, like a theater, like an umbrella, like a flag, like a stupa, like a toran, like a gopura, like a vedika, like a chopyal (intoxicated elephant), like an attalika, like a royal palace, like a haveli, like a window, like a water palace, like a Vallabhi (house with balconies), and O Ayushman Shraman! There are also trees there which are of various types of buildings, beds, seats, etc., and have a pleasant cool shade. 111. (16) Are there any houses or house-like structures on that island, Bhante?  /  Those human beings live in tree-houses, Shramanausho!  /  Are there any villages, towns, or settlements on that island, Bhante?  /  Those human beings live in the desired world, Shramanausho!  /  Are there any artisans, laborers, farmers, merchants, or traders on that island, Bhante?  /  Those human beings live in a state of complete freedom from all kinds of work, Shramanausho. 1. If the milk of one lakh cows that graze on the sugarcane of the Pund jati is given to fifty thousand cows, and the milk of those fifty thousand cows is given to twenty-five thousand cows, and so on, in a sequence of giving milk to half the number of cows, the milk of the last cow in that sequence, made into kheer with various nuts and other ingredients, is called the Kalyana Bhojan of the Chakravarti.

"Gautama! In Jambudvipa, south of Mount Meru, three hundred yojanas from the southeastern extremity of the Chulla Himvanta, the Varshadhara mountain, towards the salt sea, there is the island called Abhasika, the abode of the Abhasika humans.

"Where, O venerable one, is the island called Langoolika, the abode of the Langoolika humans?"

"Gautama! In Jambudvipa, south of Mount Meru, three hundred yojanas from the northeastern extremity of the Chulla Himvanta, the Varshadhara mountain, towards the salt sea, there is the island called Langoolika, the abode of the Langoolika humans.

Page #362:
---------------------------
[318] There are twenty-eight Antardvipas and fifty-six Antarvipas. The Himavan mountain is the boundary between the Bharat and Haimvat regions in Jambudvipa. It touches the Lavanasamudra from its east and west ends. / From the point where the Lavanasamudra water touches, two tusk-shaped teeth protrude in the east-west direction. The tooth that protrudes in the northeast corner has an island called Akoruk, 300 yojanas long and wide and slightly more than 949 yojanas in circumference, in the Lavanasamudra at a distance of 300 yojanas from the Himavan mountain. / It is adorned on all sides by a Padmavaravedika, 300 dhanus wide and two kos high. From the end of the same Himavan mountain, in the southeast corner, at a distance of 300 yojanas, one finds another tooth, on which there is an island called Abhashik, as long and wide as the Akoruk island. From the west end of the same Himavan mountain, in the southwest direction (Nairitakoona), after entering the Lavanasamudra for 300 yojanas, one finds a tooth, on which there is an island called Langoolik of the same size. And from the west end of the same Himavan mountain, in the northwest direction (Vayavya Koona), at a distance of 300 yojanas in the Lavanasamudra, one finds a tooth, on which there is an island called Vaishanik of the same size as mentioned earlier.

## Translation:

[320] Gautama! Four hundred yojanas from the northwestern extremity of the Langoolik island in the salt sea, there is an island called Shakulikarna. The rest of the description should be understood like the Hayakarna humans. O Lord! What about the Adarshamukha humans? Gautama! Five hundred yojanas from the northeastern extremity of the Hayakarna island, there is an island called Adarshamukha, inhabited by the Dakshinatya Adarshamukha humans. It is five hundred yojanas long and wide. Four islands, starting with Ashvamukha, are located six hundred yojanas further, four islands starting with Ashvakarna are located seven hundred yojanas further, four islands starting with Ulkamukha are located eight hundred yojanas further, and four islands starting with Ghanadanta are located nine hundred yojanas further. The circumference of the Ekoroot island and others should be understood as slightly more than nine hundred and seventy-five yojanas, and the circumference of the Hayakarna and others should be understood as slightly more than twelve hundred and sixty-five yojanas. // 1 // The circumference of the Adarshamukha and others is slightly more than fifteen hundred and eighty-one yojanas. In this way, these four islands are of equal measure in each group. The difference in Avagahan, Vishkambha, and Pariidhi should be understood. The Avagahan, Vishkambha, and Pariidhi of the first, second, third, and fourth groups have been stated. The fourth group has a Praayam-Vishkambha of six hundred yojanas and a Pariidhi of slightly more than 1897 yojanas. The fifth group has a Praayam-Vishkambha of seven hundred yojanas and a Pariidhi of slightly more than 2213 yojanas. The sixth group has a Praayam-Vishkambha of eight hundred yojanas and a Pariidhi of slightly more than 2529 yojanas. The seventh group has a Praayam-Vishkambha of nine hundred yojanas and a Pariidhi of slightly more than 2845 yojanas. The Avagahan is the same as the Praayam-Vishkambha. (The Pariidhi of the second group is 316 yojanas more than the first group, and the Pariidhi should be increased by 316-316 yojanas in this order. The word "Visheshadhik" should be used with all.) // 2 // O Auspicious Shraman! The rest of the description should be understood like the Ekoroot island, up to the Shuddhadant island, until those humans are born in the Devaloka. O Lord! Where is the Ekoroot island, inhabited by the Ekoroot humans of the north direction, mentioned? Gautama! Three hundred yojanas from the northeastern extremity of the Shikhari Varshadhara mountain, north of the Meru mountain in the Jambudvipa island, in the salt sea, there is an island called Ekoroot, inhabited by the Ekoroot humans of the north direction. The rest of the description should be understood like the Ekoroot island of the south direction, with the difference that these are located in the Vidishas of the Shikhari Varshadhara mountain. The description should be made in this way. The description should be made up to the Shuddhadant island. This is the complete description of the Antaradvipa humans. Discussion: The description of the four Antaradvipas, Ekoroot, Prabhashik, Langoolik, and Vaishanik, has been done in the discussion of the previous Sutra. Four hundred yojanas further from these four islands, starting with Ekoroot, in each Vidisha, in the order of northeast, etc., there are four islands, each four hundred yojanas long and wide, with a circumference of slightly more than 1265 yojanas, adorned with the aforementioned Padmavaravedika and Vanakhanda, and four hundred yojanas away from the Jambudvipa, there are Hayakarna, Gajakarna, Gokarna, and...

[330] What is the position of the gods in the inner council of Asura king Chamar? What is the position of the gods in the middle council and what is the position of the gods in the outer council?

The position of the gods in the inner council of Asura king Chamar is 2.5 palyopama, the position of the gods in the middle council is 2 palyopama and the position of the gods in the outer council is 1.5 palyopama. The position of the goddesses in the inner council is 1.5 palyopama, the position of the goddesses in the middle council is 1 palyopama and the position of the goddesses in the outer council is 0.5 palyopama.  /  O Lord! Why is it said that Asura king Chamar has three councils - Samita, Chanda and Jata?  /  The inner council is called Samita, the middle council is called Chanda and the outer council is called Jata? Gautama! The gods in the inner council of Asura king Chamar come when called, they do not come without being called.  /  The gods in the middle council come when called and also come without being called. The gods in the outer council come without being called.  /  Gautama! The second reason is that Asura king Chamar, when any kind of high-low, auspicious-inauspicious family work arises, consults with the inner council, takes their consent. He informs the middle council about his decided work, explaining the reasons etc. to them clearly and he wanders giving instructions to the outer council. For this reason, O Gautama! It is said that Asura king Chamar has three councils - Samita, Chanda and Jata. The inner council is called Samita, the middle council is called Chanda and the outer council is called Jata.  [119.]  "Where, O Venerable One, are the abodes of the Asura princes?" "Just as in the city of Thana, there are many houses, so also are there many abodes of the Asura king." "O Venerable One, how many councils are there of the Asura king?" "There are three councils, namely - Samita, Chanda and Jata. The inner one is Samita, the middle one is Chanda and the outer one is Jata." "O Venerable One, how many thousands of gods are there in the inner council of the Asura king? How many thousands of gods are there in the middle council and how many hundreds of gods are there in the outer council?" "O Venerable One, there are twenty thousand gods in the inner council of the Asura king.  1.

How many deva-sahasra are there in the inner parisa of the Naga-kumara and Naga-kumari Devas? And how many deva-sata are there in the outer parisa?"  "Tell me, Venerable One! In the Naga-kumara and Naga-kumari Devas, there are sixty deva-sahasra in the inner parisa, fifty deva-sahasra in the middle parisa, and eighty deva-sahasra in the outer parisa. In the inner parisa, there are forty-seven deva-sata, in the middle parisa, there are fifty deva-sata, and in the outer parisa, there are twenty-nine deva-sata."  "Tell me, Venerable One! How long is the duration of the Devas in the inner parisa? How long is the duration of the Devas in the middle parisa? How long is the duration of the Devas in the outer parisa?"  "Tell me, Venerable One! How long is the duration of the Devis in the inner parisa? How long is the duration of the Devis in the middle parisa?

## Third Question: The Statement of the Naga Kumaras

[333] "Bhūyānanda, tell me, how long do the Naga Kumaras stay in the inner circle of the Naga Kumaras' abode? How long do the Devis stay in the outer circle?

"Gotama, the Devas in the inner circle of the Naga Kumaras stay for a little more than half a *paliovam*, the Devas in the middle circle stay for half a *paliovam*, and the Devas in the outer circle stay for a little less than half a *paliovam*. The Devis in the inner circle stay for half a *paliovam* less than a *desoon*, the Devis in the middle circle stay for a little more than a quarter *paliovam*, and the Devis in the outer circle stay for a quarter *paliovam*.

"The meaning is like that of the *chamara* [elephant's tail]. The *pravesas* [entrances] of the *veṇudevas* [flute-playing Devas] and others, with their great noise and speed, should be understood as being without any particular time, like the *parisa* [circle] of the *parṇa* [leaf] and *bhūyānanda* [abundant joy]. The *parisa* is like the *parṇa* and *bhūyānanda*. The *vāhiṇilla* [those who do not carry] are like the *parṇa* [leaf], and the *uttarilla* [those who do not answer] are like *bhūyānanda*. The *parimāṇa* [quantity] and *sthiti* [duration] are also fixed."

[120] "O Bhagavan, where are the abodes of the Naga Kumaras mentioned?"

"Gotama, one should know the statement as it is mentioned in the *sthānapad* [place-chapter]. The question of the abode of the Naga Kumaras in the south should also be asked, where the Naga Kumarendra and Naga Kumararāja Dhṛṇa reside and enjoy divine pleasures."

"O Bhagavan, how many *parisa* [circles] does the Naga Kumarendra Naga Kumararāja Dhṛṇa have?"

"Gotama, three *parisa* are mentioned. Their names are the same as those mentioned for the *parisa* of the *chamarendra* [elephant-tail king]."

"O Bhagavan, how many thousand Devas are there in the inner *parisa* of the Naga Kumarendra Naga Kumararāja Dhṛṇa? How many hundred Devis are there in the outer *parisa*?"

"Gotama, there are sixty thousand Devas in the inner *parisa* of the Naga Kumarendra Naga Kumararāja Dhṛṇa, seventy thousand Devas in the middle *parisa*, and eighty thousand Devas in the outer *parisa*. There are 175 Devis in the inner *parisa*, 150 in the middle *parisa*, and 125 in the outer *parisa*."

"How long is the duration of the Devas in the inner *parisa* of the Naga Kumararāja Dhṛṇa? How long is the duration of the Devas in the middle *parisa* and the outer *parisa*? How long is the duration of the Devis in the inner *parisa*, the middle *parisa*, and the outer *parisa*?"

"Gotama, the duration of the Devas in the inner *parisa* of the Naga Kumararāja Dhṛṇa is a little more than half a *paliovam*, the duration of the Devas in the middle *parisa* is half a *paliovam*, and the duration of the Devas in the outer *parisa* is a little less than half a *paliovam*. The duration of the Devis in the inner *parisa* is half a *paliovam* less than a *desoon*, the duration of the Devis in the middle *parisa* is a little more than a quarter *paliovam*, and the duration of the Devis in the outer *parisa* is a quarter *paliovam*."

"The meaning of the three types of *parisa* should be understood like the previous statement about the *chamarendra*." 

Page #378:
---------------------------
[334]  O Bhagavan! Where are the abodes of the Naga Kumaras in the North direction mentioned? It should be known according to the description of the location in the original text.  There, the Naga Kumarendra, Naga Kumararaj, Bhutananda resides and enjoys the pleasures. O Bhagavan! How many thousands of Devas are there in the inner council of Naga Kumarendra, Naga Kumararaj, Bhutananda? How many thousands of Devas are there in the middle council and how many thousands of Devas are there in the outer council? How many hundreds of Devis are there in the inner council, how many hundreds of Devis are there in the middle council and how many hundreds of Devis are there in the outer council? Gautama! There are fifty thousand Devas in the inner council of Naga Kumarendra, Naga Kumararaj, Bhutananda, sixty thousand Devas in the middle council and seventy thousand Devas in the outer council. There are 225 Devis in the inner council, 200 Devis in the middle council and 175 Devis in the outer council. O Bhagavan! What is the extent of the Devas in the inner council of Naga Kumarendra, Naga Kumararaj, Bhutananda? What is the extent of the Devis in the outer council? Gautama! The extent of the Devas in the inner council of Bhutananda is Deshona Palyopama, the extent of the Devas in the middle council is slightly more than half Palyopama and the extent of the Devas in the outer council is half Palyopama. The extent of the Devis in the inner council is half Palyopama, the extent of the Devis in the middle council is Deshona half Palyopama and the extent of the Devis in the outer council is slightly more than a quarter Palyopama. The meaning of the councils should be known like that of Chamarendra. The rest, starting from Venudeva and ending with Mahaghosh, should be described completely according to the description of the location. There is a difference in the councils, which is as follows: The council of the Indra, the lord of the abode in the South direction, should be described like that of Dharanendra and the council of the Indra, the lord of the abode in the North direction, should be described like that of Bhutananda. The number and extent of the Devas and Devis in the councils should also be known in the same way.  Discussion: The present sutras describe the abodes, councils, evidence of the councils and extent of the Asura Kumaras and Naga Kumaras, the lords of the abodes, which is clear from the original text. Further, there is information about the residents of the abodes like Suparna Kumaras, etc., which should be known like that of Dharanendra and Bhutananda. The description of the lords of the abodes in the South direction should be known like that of Dharanendra and the description of the lords of the abodes in the North direction should be known like that of Bhutananda. There is a difference in the number of abodes, names of the Indras and their quantity, etc., in these lords of the abodes, which has been described by the previous teachers in seven verses, the meaning of which is as follows: 1. Chausatthi Asuraanam Chulasiicheva Hoi Naagaanam / Baavattari Suvanne Vayukumaaraanam Chhannauh // 1 // (Rest on the next page)

**121.** "Venerable Sir, what is the arrangement of the abodes (earthly mansions) of the gods of the inner realms? As long as they dwell in the place of their abode."

"Venerable Sir, what is the arrangement of the abodes of the gods of the Pisacaya realm? As long as they dwell in the place of their abode."

[338] Jivajivaabhigamsutra [121]  O Bhagavan! Where are the abodes (earthly cities) of the Vanavyantara Devas said to be? As it is said in the Sthanapad, one should state it, as long as they wander enjoying divine pleasures. O Bhagavan! Where are the abodes of the Pisacha Devas said to be? As it is said in the Sthanapad, one should state it, as long as they wander enjoying divine pleasures. There, two Pisacha Kumar Rajas named Kala and Maha Kala reside, as long as they wander. O Bhagavan! Where are the abodes of the Pisacha Kumaras of the south direction said to be? One should state it, as long as they wander enjoying pleasures. There, the great Pisacha Kumar Indra Pisacha Kumar Raja resides, as long as they wander enjoying pleasures. O Bhagavan! How many councils does the Pisacha Kumar Indra Pisacha Raja Kala have? Gautama! There are three councils. They are as follows: Isha, Trutita, and Dridharatha. The inner council is called Isha. The middle council is Trutita, and the outer council is called Dridharatha. O Bhagavan! How many thousand Devas are there in the inner council of the Pisacha Kumar Indra Pisacha Raja Kala? How many hundred Devis are there in the outer council? Gautama! There are eight thousand Devas in the inner council of the Pisacha Kumar Indra Pisacha Raja Kala, ten thousand Devas in the middle council, and twelve thousand Devas in the outer council. There are one hundred Devis in the inner council, one hundred in the middle council, and one hundred in the outer council as well. O Bhagavan! What is the extent of the Devas of the inner council of the Pisacha Kumar Indra Pisacha Raja? What is the extent of the Devas of the middle council and the outer council? What is the extent of the Devis of the outer council? Gautama! The extent of the Devas of the inner council of the Pisacha Kumar Indra Pisacha Raja Kala is half a Palyopam, the extent of the Devas of the middle council is half a Palyopam, and the extent of the Devas of the outer council is slightly more than a quarter Palyopam. The extent of the Devis of the inner council is a Palyopam, the extent of the Devis of the middle council is a quarter Palyopam, and the extent of the Devis of the outer council is slightly more than a quarter Palyopam. The meaning of the councils should be stated like the statement of Chamarendra. Similarly, one should state about the Vanavyantaras of the north direction. All the above statements should be stated up to the Gandharva Indra named Giteyash. Discussion: This Sutra contains questions and answers regarding the earthly cities of the Vanavyantaras. The question is asked: Where are the abodes (earthly cities) of the Vanavyantara Devas? In the answer, it is informed to state according to the second Sthanapad of the Prajnapanasutra. In short, the description given in the Prajnapanasutra is as follows: Above the one thousand Yojan thick Ratnamay Kand of this Ratnaprabahaprithvi, after descending one hundred Yojan and leaving one hundred Yojan below, there are countless earthly (like earth houses) lakhs of cities of the Vanavyantara Devas in the middle eight hundred Yojan.

## Third Rebirth: The Authority of the Vanavyantara [339]

These [cities] are round on the outside, square on the inside, and are constructed with a foundation like the seed of a lotus. They are surrounded by deep and wide ditches and moats. They are equipped with ramparts, atalaka (covered halls), doors, toranas (gateways), and gateways, as described in Sutra 117. These buildings are pleasing, beautiful, and well-proportioned. Many Vanavyantara gods, including Pisacha, reside in these cities. These gods are very fickle, playful, and fond of humor due to their restless minds. They are deeply attached to serious laughter, songs, and dances. They are adorned with garlands of flowers, kalangi (a type of head ornament), crowns, earrings, and other ornaments as they desire. Their chests are adorned with long, beautiful, and blooming garlands of various flowers, made from fragrant flowers that bloom in all seasons. They enjoy sensual pleasures as they desire, possess forms and bodies as they wish, wear various colors, and wear the finest, varied, and bright clothes. They are fond of amusement, love (sexual play), quarrels, games, and noise. They are full of laughter and conversation. They carry swords, maces, spears, and lances in their hands. They are adorned with various symbols made of many gems and jewels. They are powerful, radiant, glorious, strong, noble, capable, happy, and have chests adorned with garlands. Their arms are strong and bound with bracelets. Angada (a type of ornament) and earrings touch their cheeks. They wear ear ornaments. Their bodies are extremely radiant. They wear long garlands. They move about, illuminating and radiating the ten directions with their divine color, divine fragrance, divine touch, divine solidity, divine form, divine power, divine radiance, divine brilliance, divine shadow (luster), divine fire (light), divine energy, and divine aura. They rule over their millions of earth-dwelling city dwellers, their thousands of Samanika gods, their chief queens, their councils, their armies, their army commanders, their protectors, and many other Vanavyantara gods and goddesses. They enjoy divine pleasures with great festivity, dancing, singing, and playing musical instruments like the veena, tal (cymbals), taal (rhythm), trutit ghan (a type of drum), mridanga (a type of drum), and other instruments, creating a great sound. This description is general for the Vanavyantara. In particular, the description of the Pisacha and other Vanavyantara should be understood in the same way. That is, in those earth-dwelling cities, the Pisacha gods rule over their own buildings, Samanika gods, and goddesses. In these cities, two Pisacha kings, Kala and Maha Kala, reside. They are powerful, radiant, and enjoy divine pleasures. Kala is the king of the Pisacha in the southern region, and Maha Kala is the king of the Pisacha in the northern region. Kala, the Pisacha king, rules over countless earth-dwelling cities like millions of cities, four thousand Samanika gods, four chief queens, three councils, seven armies, seven...

---------------------------
[340] The commander-in-chief of the Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamata army, who commands sixteen thousand primary protectors of the gods, and many gods and goddesses from the southern direction, wanders around. The Pisacha-chandra, the king of the Pisachas, has three councils: Isha, Trutita, and Dridharatha. The inner council is called Isha, the middle council is called Trutita, and the outer council is called Dridharatha. The inner council has eight thousand gods, the middle council has ten thousand gods, and the outer council has twelve thousand gods. The number of goddesses in all three councils is the same - one hundred. Their positions are as follows: The gods of the inner council have a position of half a Palyopam. The gods of the middle council have a position of a little more than half a Palyopam. The gods of the outer council have a position of a little more than a quarter of a Palyopam. The goddesses of the inner council have a position of a little more than a quarter of a Palyopam. The goddesses of the middle council have a position of a quarter of a Palyopam. The goddesses of the outer council have a position of a little more than a quarter of a Palyopam. The meaning of the councils should be understood in the same way as it was said in the case of Chamarendra, etc. The description of the later Pisacha-kumar gods is also similar to that of the southern ones. Their Indra is Mahakal. Mahakal's description is the same as that of Kal. Similarly, the description of the Bhutas, up to the Gandharva-devas' Indra, Gitayash, is the same. There is a difference in this description, with each having their own Indra. The difference in Indras is described in two verses as follows: (1) Two Indras of the Pisachas - Kal and Mahakal (2) Two Indras of the Bhutas - Surup and Pratirup (3) Two Indras of the Yakshas - Purnabhadra and Manibhadra (4) Two Indras of the Rakshasas - Bhima and Maha-bhima (5) Two Indras of the Kinnaras - Kinnara and Kimpurusha (6) Two Indras of the Kimpurushas - Satpurusha and Mahapurusha (7) Two Indras of the Atikayas - Atikaya and Maha-kaya (8) Two Indras of the Gandharvas - Giterati and Gitayash 1.

## Third Section: Description of the Vimanas of the Jyotishka Devas [341]

It has been said that among the two Indras, the first is the Indra of the Devas in the southern direction, and the second is the Indra of the Vanavyantara Devas in the northern direction. Here, the authority of the Vanavyantara Devas ends. Further, information about the Jyotishka Devas is given.

**Description of the Vimanas of the Jyotishka Devas [122]**

"O Bhagavan! Where are the Vimanas of the Jyotishka Devas located?"

"O Bhagavan! Where do the Jyotishka Devas reside?"

"Gautama! Above the islands and oceans, and from the very level and beautiful land of this Ratnapraba earth, going up seven hundred and ninety yojanas, in a region of one hundred and ten yojanas in height, there are countless lakhs of Vimanas of the Jyotishka Devas, called Jyotishi-Vimanas, in a slanting position. (This has been said by me and other previous Tirthankaras)."

"These Vimanas are of the shape of a half-Kabiṭa - and so on, as described in the Sthānapada. There, the Jyotishkendra, Jyotishkarāja, Chandra and Surya, the two Indras, reside and enjoy great pleasures."

"O Bhagavan! How many Parisadas are there for the Jyotishkendra, Jyotishkarāja Surya?"

"Gautama! Three Parisadas are mentioned, namely: Tumba, Truṭita and Pretya. The inner Parisada is called Tumba, the middle Parisada is called Truṭita, and the outer Parisada is called Pretya. The rest of the description should be understood like that of the Kala Indra. Their quantity (number of Devas and Devis) and position should also be understood in the same way. The meaning of Parisada should be understood like that of the Chamarendra. According to the statement of Surya, the statement of Chandra should also be understood."

**Discussion:** From the very level and beautiful land of this Ratnapraba earth, going up seven hundred and ninety (790) yojanas... 

Page #386:
---------------------------
The Jyotishka Kshetra is located at a height of one hundred and ten Yojanas from the surface of the earth, within the outer boundary of the Jeevajeevaabhigamsutra, and extends for countless Yojanas diagonally. This celestial realm is home to countless lakhs of Jyotishka Vimanas, the aerial vehicles of the Jyotishka Devas. These Vimanas are shaped like half a Kabitha, entirely made of crystal. They are white in color, with a radiant glow, and rise up from the front, extending in all directions. They are adorned with various jewels, gold, and gems, making them beautifully intricate. They are adorned with victory flags, banners, and umbrellas, and are very tall, reaching the sky. They are studded with jewels in their lattices and shine brightly like objects revealed after removing a cage. They are adorned with mounds of jewels and gems, and have blooming hundred-petaled and lotus flowers. They are beautifully decorated with tilak marks and crescent moons made of jewels, and adorned with garlands of various jewels. They are smooth both inside and outside, and their bases are adorned with golden hairs. They are pleasant to touch, prosperous, beautiful, joyful, visible, attractive, and extremely beautiful. Many Jyotishka Devas reside in these Vimanas, including Brihaspati, Chandra, Surya, Shukra, Shani, Rahu, Dhumeketu, Budha, and Angaraka (Mangal). They are all slightly reddish in color, like heated, tempered gold. These Jyotishka Devas, along with the planets that roam the Jyotishka Kshetra, the constellations that are constantly in motion, the stars of five colors in various shapes, and the celestial bodies that move, travel, and rotate endlessly, all reside in these Vimanas. Each of them has a symbol of their name on their crown. They are all very powerful and roam, illuminating all ten directions. These Jyotishka Devas rule over their lakhs of Vimanas, their thousands of Samanika Devas, their chief consorts, their councils, their armies and army commanders, their thousands of self-protecting Devas, and many other Jyotishka Devas and Devis. Among them, Chandrama and Surya, the Jyotishka Kendra and Jyotishka Raja, are the two Indras, who are very powerful and illuminate all ten directions. They rule over their lakhs of Vimanas, their four thousand Samanika Devas, their four chief consorts, their three councils, their seven armies and army commanders, their sixteen thousand self-protecting Devas, and many other Jyotishka Devas and Devis. These two Indras, Surya and Chandra, have three councils each. Their names are Tumba, Trutita, and Pretya. The inner council is called Tumba, the middle council is called Trutita, and the outer council is called Pretya. The number of Devas and Devis in these councils and their positions should be known like the Kal Indra. The meaning of the councils should be understood according to the description of the Adi Adhikar Chamarendra. The authority of Chandrama should be understood in the same way as that of Surya.

[343 In the context of the Tiryanchlok, the statement of the Island-Ocean] [123. "Where, O Blessed One, are the Island-Oceans situated?" "How many, O Blessed One, are the Island-Oceans?" "How large, O Blessed One, are those Island-Oceans?" "What is the shape, O Blessed One, of those Island-Oceans?" "What is the nature of their shape, O Blessed One?" "Gautama, the Island beginning with Jambudvipa and the Ocean beginning with the Salt Ocean, are all of one shape, being circular. They are of many kinds in terms of their extent, being twice as large as the previous one, with waves appearing, adorned with many lotuses, padmas, kumudas, nalins, beautiful, fragrant, pundarikas, maha-pundarikas, satapatras, sahasrapatras, with their blooming pollen, each surrounded by a lotus-platform, and each surrounded by a forest-section. O Ayushman Shraman, in this Tiryanchlok, there are countless Island-Oceans, extending up to the Swayambhuraman Ocean." [123]

## Third Chapter: The Statement of Islands and Seas in the Context of the Tiryanch Lok

[345] The Jambudvipa is surrounded on all sides by a group of lattices (jalī) which are spread out in all directions. This group of lattices is half a yojana high, five hundred dhanus wide, made of all precious gems, pure, soft, smooth, beautiful, and very beautiful.

In the Tiryanch Lok, the Jambudvipa is the first of the islands and seas. It is the beginning of the islands and seas, and their end is in the Svayambhu Ramanasamudra. Therefore, the Jambudvipa is the innermost of all the islands and seas. It is the smallest because all the seas and islands beyond it are twice as large as the previous one.

Beyond the Jambudvipa is the Lavanasamudra, which is two lakh yojanas wide. Beyond that is the Dhatukikhand, which is four lakh yojanas wide. In this way, the size doubles with each successive sea and island.

The Jambudvipa is spherical in shape. This roundness is explained through similes. It is round like a malpua cooked in oil. A malpua cooked in ghee does not have the same roundness as one cooked in oil, hence the epithet "tellapay" (cooked in oil). Another simile is that of a chariot wheel. The Jambudvipa is round like a chariot wheel. The third simile is that of a lotus seed. It is round like a lotus seed. The fourth simile is that of a full moon. The Jambudvipa is round like the full moon. It is not round like a bangle.

The Jambudvipa is one lakh yojanas long and wide, and its circumference (parikshep gheeraav) is three lakh sixteen thousand two hundred twenty-seven (316227) yojanas, three kos, one hundred twenty-eight dhanus, and slightly more than thirteen and a half angulas. (The circumference is approximately three times the diameter).

Around the Jambudvipa is a jagati, which is like the rampart of a city. The jagati is eight yojanas high and twelve yojanas wide at the base, four yojanas wide in the middle and at the top, meaning it is shaped like a raised go-puccha (tail of a cow). It is entirely made of precious gems. It is pure like light and crystal, smooth like a cloth made of fine threads because it is made of smooth particles, smooth like a crumpled cloth, polished like a stone statue rubbed with a smooth stone, free from natural dust, free from external dirt, free from blemishes like darkness, free from shadows because of its bright light, impressive in its form, beautiful in its unique beauty, full of rays of light, illuminating external objects, pleasing to the mind, not tiring the mind or the eyes when looked at, therefore it is worth seeing. Its form is very attractive to those who see it. Its form remains as new as ever, therefore it is a prototype.

This jagati is surrounded by a lattice (jalaktak). Just as there are windows and skylights in the walls of a building, there are lattices all around. This group of lattices is two kos high and five hundred dhanus wide. This is the measurement of one lattice. This jalaktak (group of lattices) ...

The Third Discourse: Description of the Padmavaravedika [From 347]

"What is a Padmavaravedika, Venerable Sir?"

"Well, a Padmavaravedika is a platform, a platform where, in that particular place, in those particular regions, in those particular Vedikas, in those particular Vedika-bhaasas, in those particular Vedika-sisa-phalas, in those particular Vedika-pudantaras, in those particular Khamas, in those particular Khamba-bhaasas, in those particular Khamba-soses, in those particular Khamba-pudantaras, in those particular Suis, in those particular Sui-muhas, in those particular Sui-phalas, in those particular Sui-pudantaras, in those particular Pakkhas, in those particular Pakkha-bhaasas, in those particular Pakkha-perantaras, there are many, many Uppa-laais, Pau-maais, even up to a hundred thousand Pattaais, all adorned with Achchaais, Sahaais, Lanhaais, Dhatthaais, Mattaa-is, Gorayaais, Nimmalaais, Nippankaais, Nikkankadchchaayaais, Sapphabaais, Samiriyaais, Saujjoyaais, Pasaadiyaais, Darisanijjaais, Abhiruvaais, Padiruvaais, Maha-maha-Vasikkachchattasamayaais, and Pannaattaais, O Samanau-so!"

"So, Venerable Sir, that is what is called a Padmavaravedika."

"Venerable Sir, is it a Sasaya or an Asasaya?"

"Well, it is a Sasaya, it is an Asasaya."

"So, Venerable Sir, that is what is called a Sasaya, an Asasaya."

"Well, it is a Sasaya because of the Dabdhattaya; it is an Asasaya because of the Vanna-pajjavehis, Gandha-pajjavehis, Rasa-pajjavehis, and Phasa-panjjavehis."

"So, Venerable Sir, that is what is called a Sasaya, an Asasaya."

"Venerable Sir, how long does the Kalamo last?"

"Well, it has never been, it is now, and it will never be. It is, it was, and it will be. It is a Sasaya according to the Dhuva-niyaya, an Akkhaya, an Anvaya, a Pravatiya, a Niccha Padmavaravediya."

[125] In the exact middle of that world, there is said to be a vast Padmavaravedika. That Padmavaravedika is half a yojana high and five hundred dhanus wide. It is made of all jewels. Its circumference is equal to the circumference of the middle part of the world. This Padmavaravedika is made of all jewels, it is pure, it is beautiful, it is perfect. The description of that Padmavaravedika is as follows: its Nems (the parts that rise above the ground) are made of Vajraratna, its Mula-paayas (the base) are made of Rishtaratra, its pillars are made of Vaiduryaratna, its Pattis (panels) are made of gold and silver, its joints are made of Vajra, its Suchias (these Suchias are like sandals that hold the Pattis together, preventing them from disintegrating) are made of Lohitakshararatna! The pictures of human beings and other bodies that are drawn here are made of many kinds of jewels, and the pictures of pairs of men and women are also made of many kinds of jewels. The pictures that are drawn in addition to the human pictures are all made of many kinds of jewels. The pictures of pairs of many beings are also made of various jewels. Its Pakkha-ajuu-baaju parts (the sides) are made of Ankaratnas. The large, large Prushta-vanshas are made of a jewel called Jyotiraratna. The bamboo that is placed on both sides of the large vanshas in a slanting manner to keep them stable is also made of Jyotiraratna. The long wooden planks that are placed on top of the bamboo on the roof are made of silver. The Prohadanias (large kimdias for covering) that are placed on top of the Kambas (pillars) to cover them are made of gold, and the Punchhanias (small kimdias like soft grass for dense covering) are made of Vajraratna. The covering above the Punchhani and below the Kavel is made of white silver.

348]] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra] The Padmavaravedika is adorned with garlands of gold, hanging from all directions. Some are made of precious stones, some are shaped like small bells, some are shaped like large bells, some are made of pearls, some are made of gems, some are made of gold, and some are shaped like lotus flowers. These garlands are suspended from long, golden canopies, decorated with gold leaf, and adorned with various necklaces and half-necklaces of different types of gems. They are spaced close together, swaying gently in the breeze coming from the east, west, north, and south, vibrating, stretching out, and clanging together. The sound produced by these garlands is loud, yet pleasing, charming, and soothing to the ears and minds of the listeners. These garlands, filled with pleasing sounds, adorn all directions with their beauty.

In different places on the Padmavaravedika, there are carvings of groups of horses, elephants, men, Kinnaras, Kimpurushas, Mahoragas, Gandharvas, and bulls, all made of precious stones, pure, and perfect in form. In different places on the Padmavaravedika, there are rows of horses, rows of bulls, etc., all made of precious stones, pure, and perfect in form. In different places on the Padmavaravedika, there are double rows of horses, double rows of bulls, etc., all made of precious stones, pure, and perfect in form. In different places on the Padmavaravedika, there are pairs of horses, pairs of bulls, etc., all made of precious stones, perfect in form.

On the Padmavaravedika, there are many lotus vines, naga vines, ashoka vines, champaca vines, chautavana vines, vasanti vines, atimukta vines, kunda vines, and shyamala vines, all perpetually blooming, with well-arranged and distinctive flower clusters. These vines are made of precious stones, smooth, soft, fragrant, sweet, lotus-like, pure, spotless, flawless, radiant, luminous, bright, pleasing, beautiful, and perfect in form. (On the Padmavaravedika, there are many auspicious swastikas, all made of precious stones and pure.)

O Bhagavan! Why is the Padmavaravedika called the Padmavaravedika?

Gautama! On the Padmavaravedika, in different places, on the platforms (elevated places for sitting), on the sides of the platforms, between two platforms, around the pillars, on the tops of the pillars, in the spaces between two pillars, on the moldings that connect two panels, and on the faces of the moldings...

## Third Chapter: Forest Section - Dharma

On the **Padmavara-Vedika**, below and above the lists, in the spaces between the two lists, on the sides of the platform, in the country of the sides, in the interval between the two sides, there are many **utpala** (lotus), **padma** (sun-blooming lotus), **kumuda** (moon-blooming lotus), **nalin**, **subhaga**, **saugandhika**, **puṇḍarīka** (white lotus), **mahapuṇḍarīka** (large white lotus), **śatapatra**, **sahasrapatra**, and other various lotuses. These lotuses are all made of jewels, they are clean, they are beautiful, they are perfect. All these lotuses are the size of large umbrellas (parasols) that are put up during the rainy season. O venerable **śramaṇa**! For this reason, the **Padmavara-Vedika** is called the **Padmavara-Vedika**. O **bhagavan**! Is the **Padmavara-Vedika** eternal or non-eternal? Gautama! It is eternal in some respects and non-eternal in some respects. - O **bhagavan**! Why is it said that the **Padmavara-Vedika** is eternal in some respects and non-eternal in some respects? Gautama! It is eternal with respect to its substance and non-eternal with respect to its color variations, taste variations, smell variations, and touch variations. Therefore, O Gautama! It is said that the **Padmavara-Vedika** is eternal in some respects and non-eternal in some respects. O **bhagavan**! For how long will the **Padmavara-Vedika** remain with respect to time? Gautama! It is not the case that it "never was", it is not the case that it "never is", it is not the case that it "never will be". It was, it is, and it will always be. It is firm, fixed, eternal, imperishable, unchanging, existing, and permanent. This is the description of the **Padmavara-Vedika**.

## Forest Section Description 126 [1]

Then, O **jagaiye**, outside the **Padmavara-Vedika**, there is a great forest, extending for two **yojanas** in circumference, with a **cakavālavīkṣambha** (a measure of distance), in the time of the world, in the **parikṣepa** (a measure of distance), with a **kiṇha** (a type of tree) and a **kiṇhobhāsa** (a type of tree), as far as the **pāyava** (a type of tree) with roots, stems, branches, leaves, fruits, and flowers, with **aṇaputhvasujāyiruilavaṭṭamāva** (a type of tree), with **parināya** (a type of tree), with **ega-khaṇḍī** (a type of tree), with **aṇega-sāha-sāha-viḍimā** (a type of tree), with **aṇega-ṇaravvamā-supasāriya-gejma-ghaṇa-viula-yadṛkha-ṣā** (a type of tree), with **acchidda-patta** (a type of tree), with **aviral-patta** (a type of tree), with **avāiṇa-patta** (a type of tree), with **aṇai-i-patta** (a type of tree), with **ṇiyaja-ṛḍha-paṇḍura-patta** (a type of tree), with **nava-hariya-bhisanta-patta-ṣa-yāragam-bhīra-varisa-ṇijjā** (a type of tree), with **uvavini-g-gaya-ṇavata-ruṇa-patta-pallava-komalu-jjala-calanta-kisalaya-sukumāla-sohiya-varanka-kura-ggasira** (a type of tree), always blooming, always bearing fruit, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves, always bearing flowers, always bearing branches, always bearing fruits, always bearing leaves,

## Third Chapter: Description of the Forest

[351] The advanced words that are heard, continue to chirp and chatter, adding to the beauty of these trees. A community of intoxicated bees and wasps, who gather honey, hover over them. Intoxicated by the nectar they have collected from other places, the buzzing bees, engrossed in the consumption of pollen, hum sweetly, filling the trees with their sound. The flowers and fruits of these trees remain hidden within them. These trees are covered with leaves and flowers from the outside. These trees are free from all kinds of diseases, free from thorns. Their fruits are delicious and have a smooth touch. These trees are adorned with various types of clusters, shrubs, and vine-covered arbors. Many types of flags flutter on them. To irrigate these trees, beautiful net-like structures are built in square wells, round ponds, and long lamps. These trees release such a unique and pleasant fragrance that one cannot be satisfied with it. The beds of these trees are auspicious, and the flags on them are also multi-faceted.

Many chariots, carts, vehicles, Yugya (a type of carriage famous in the Golldesh region), Shivika, and Syandamanika are left under them (due to the abundance of shade). That forest is picturesque, joyful, smooth, soft, thick, sweet, watery, spotless, pure, with unblemished radiance, luminous, radiant, shining, majestic, beautiful, attractive, and exemplary. Inside that forest is a very even and beautiful land. That land is as smooth as the stretched leather of a Mruj (a type of musical instrument), as smooth as the stretched leather of a Mridanga, as smooth as the bottom of a water-filled lake, as smooth as a palm, as smooth as a mirror, as smooth as the moon, as smooth as the sun, as smooth as the leather of an Urbhra (a type of drum), as smooth as the leather of a bull, as smooth as the skin of a Varaha (pig), as smooth as the skin of a lion, as smooth as the skin of a tiger, as smooth as the skin of a wolf, and as smooth as the skin of a cheetah. When the skin of all these animals is stretched with thousands of nails, it becomes perfectly smooth (hence these similes are used to describe the smoothness of that land). That forest is adorned with gems, various types of five-colored gems, flower garlands, lotus petals, ocean waves, spring vines, lotus vines, and various other pictures, all arranged in a pattern, in a series, in a row, in a swastika, in a sauvastika, in a Pushyamana, in a Vardhamana, in a Matsyandaka, in a Makaranda, in a Jarmarala, and with grass. Those gems are radiant, luminous, shining, and have a black-like, five-colored appearance. That forest is adorned with such five-colored gems and grass.

The discussion presented in this sutra describes the forest. This forest, which is about two yojanas in extent and has a circumference equal to that of the earth, is dark and appears dark due to its lush greenery and abundance of shade. The word "Yavat" is given further, from which other adjectives given elsewhere should be understood as follows:

* Harie Hariobhaase - The forest is green in some places and appears green.
* Nile Niloabhaase - The forest is blue in some places and appears blue.
* Leaves that have not crossed the green stage and reached the black stage are called blue.

Due to these combinations, the forest is called blue and bluish.

---------------------------
[352] [The ninth section of the Sutrakritanga, the section on the forest, is described as cool and cool-appearing. When the leaves have passed childhood, they become cool. Due to their combination, the forest is also cool and appears cool. Intense, smooth, and sharp are the terms used to describe the black, blue, and green colors in their own nature. Due to this combination, the forest is also described as smooth, smooth-appearing, sharp, and sharp-appearing. Appearance can also be deceptive, like the mirage in the desert, which is a deceptive appearance of water. Therefore, to negate the deceptive appearance, other adjectives have been given, such as black and black-shadowed. The forest appears black and black-shadowed to everyone equally. This indicates its inconsistency. Deceptive appearance does not appear the same to everyone. Blue and blue-shadowed, cool and cool-shadowed. The forest is blue and blue-shadowed. It is cool and cool-shadowed. Here, the word "shadow" should be understood as the opposite of sunlight. Dense-shadowed. The trees in this forest have dense shade in the middle because there are many branches and twigs spread out in the middle. This makes their shade dense. Delightful. This forest is delightful. Like a multitude of great rain clouds filled with water. The description of the trees in the forest is clear from the original text, which is given in parentheses. The land of that forest is extremely delightful and flat. Various similes have been given to describe its flatness. The flatness of the land has been compared to the stretched skin of various animals like a buffalo, a drum, a lake, a palm, a mirror, the moon, the sun, the skin of a bull, and the skin of a bull. When the skin of these animals is stretched with the help of nails, it becomes completely smooth and flat, without any wrinkles. Similarly, the land is flat, not bumpy, uneven, or high and low. Therefore, it is extremely delightful. Not only that, but various kinds of paintings are drawn on that flat land. These paintings include paintings of mountains, valleys, rows, series, swastikas, auspicious swastikas, prosperous men, growing standards, fish-shaped ornaments, crocodile-shaped ornaments, and five-colored jewels with the characteristics of a jar-shaped ornament. Paintings of flower garlands, bird feathers, ocean waves, spring creepers, lotus creepers, etc., are painted with five-colored jewels and grass. Those jewels are of five colors, they are lustrous, radiant, and illuminating. The next section of the sutra describes the five types of jewels and grass through similes. It is as follows: 126. [2] There, those black grasses and jewels, they are described as having this color and appearance. They are like charcoal, collyrium, antimony, lampblack, ink, a kind of red earth, and a kind of red earth. 1-In some manuscripts, the reading "ink" and "a kind of red earth" is not present.

The Third Chapter: Description of the Forest (355 126. (6) It has been said that the color of those white grasses and gems is like that of an Anka gem, a conch shell, the moon, a Kunda flower, a Kumuda (white lotus), a drop of water, (curdled milk, milk, a stream of milk), a row of swans, a row of Krouncha birds, a row of pearl necklaces, a row of silver bangles, a row of moons reflected in the waves of a lake, autumn clouds, a silver plate washed in fire, a plate of ground rice, a cluster of Kunda flowers, a cluster of Kumudas, a dry bean pod, the middle part of a peacock feather, a Mrinala, a Mrinalika, an elephant's tusk, a clove leaf, the petals of a white lotus, a garland of Sindhuvara flowers, a white Ashoka tree, a white Kaner tree, a white Bandhujeevak tree, Bhagavan! Is the color of those white grasses and gems like this? Gautam! This is not true. / The color of those grasses and gems is said to be even more desirable, beautiful, pleasing, and attractive. [126] (7) Bhagavan! What is the fragrance of those grasses and gems said to be like? Like that of Koष्ट (a type of fragrant substance) pots, Patra pots, Choya pots (a type of fragrant substance), Tagar pots, Elaichi pots, Chandan pots, 1.

[356] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra] When the saffron, khus, champaca, marva, daman, jasmine, juhi, mogra, navamallika, vasanti lata, kewda and camphor are opened in favorable wind, when they are broken, crushed, made into small pieces, scattered, thrown up, consumed, used and transferred from one vessel to another, the fragrance that spreads all around is vast, pleasing, and satisfying to the nose and mind. O Bhagavan! Is that fragrance the same as that of those herbs and gems? Gautama! This is not true. The fragrance of those herbs and gems is said to be even more desirable, beautiful, pleasant, pleasing and captivating. 126. (8) O Bhagavan! How is the touch of those herbs and gems described? Is it like the touch of a soft leather garment, cotton, a bur plant, butter, a swan's down, a cluster of sirisha flowers, a mass of newly born lotus leaves? Is their touch like that? Gautama! This is not true. The touch of those herbs and gems is even more desirable, beautiful, pleasant, pleasing and captivating. 126. (9) O Bhagavan!

[Third Chapter: Description of the Forest] Those who understand the subtle.  What kind of sound is produced by the vibration of the grass and gems, caused by the wind coming from the east, west, south, and north, especially when it vibrates, vibrates repeatedly, is agitated, moved, and pulsates, and when it is stimulated?  Like a Shibika (a special palanquin with a covered canopy), a Syandamanika (a large palanquin, the size of a man, with a special jumpan), and a Sangram Rath (whose platform is the size of a man's waist), which is adorned with umbrellas, flags, large bells hanging on both sides, a magnificent torana, Nandighosh (the sound of twelve types of musical instruments), small bells (ghughrus), adorned with golden garlands all around, made of tinish wood with beautiful and charming pictures of the Himalayas, inlaid with gold, with well-fitted axles and a strong axle, with iron bands on the wheels, adorned with excellent horses, driven by a skilled and expert charioteer, with thirty-two tunir, each with one hundred arrows, with a helmet as its crown, full of various weapons like bows, arrows, spears, and their coverings, and decorated for the battle of warriors, when it moves rapidly in the royal court, or in the inner palace, or on the floor inlaid with gems, going back and forth, what kind of generous, pleasing, ear and mind-satisfying sound comes out from all sides, is that the sound of those grasses and gems?  O Gautam! This meaning is not true.  O Bhagavan! Just as a Vaitalika (a mangalpathica) Veena, which is played even in the absence of a taal, is adorned with a murcchana called Uttaramanda (under the Gandhar swara), is placed properly in the lap of the player, is rubbed with a cone (vadan danda) made of sandalwood, is held by a skilled male or female player, and when it is vibrated gently and especially, played, agitated, moved, pulsated, rubbed, and stimulated in the morning and evening, what kind of generous, pleasing, ear and mind-satisfying sound comes out from all sides, is that the sound of those grasses and gems? 

Page #402:
---------------------------
[358] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra Gautam! This meaning is not valid. Bhagavan! Just as Kinnaras, Kimpurushas, Mahoragas and Gandharvas reside in Bhadrashalavana, Nandanaavana, Somanasavana and Pandakavana, who are seated in the caves of the Himalayas, Malaya Mountains or Mount Meru, who are gathered in one place, who are seated facing each other, who are comfortably seated without rubbing against each other, who are situated in the same place, who are delighted and engrossed in play, who have a liking for songs and whose minds are delighted by performing Gandharva Natya etc., their eight types of songs, namely, prose, poetry, narrative, structured (one-letter form), foot-bound (four parts of a verse), thrown (first started), promoter (from the first beginning, thrown upwards), slow (slow in the middle part), these eight types of songs, songs with an interesting ending, songs with seven notes, songs with literary flavors, songs free from six defects, songs with eleven ornaments, songs with eight qualities, songs sung with the melodious sound of a flute, songs attached to raga, songs pure in three places - chest, throat, head, sweet, even, graceful, songs sung with a flute on one side and a stringed instrument (veena) on the other, with harmony between the two, songs with rhythm, songs with rhythm, songs with notes (sung according to the pre-determined notes of the flute, stringed instrument etc.), beautiful, soft and melodious (matching the notes of the stringed instrument etc.), songs with a flow of words, songs that give pleasure to the listeners, songs with beautiful bends of the limbs, songs of the best beauty, what is the sound that comes out of the mouths of those Kinnaras etc. who sing such divine songs? Yes Gautam! The sound produced by the vibration of those grasses and gems is of this kind. Discussion - In that forest area, the sound that comes out when the grasses and gems are vibrated and driven by the wind is described in this sutra section. Shri Gautam Swami has mentioned three similes for that level. The first simile is - a palanquin (shibika or jumpan) or a war chariot adorned with various types of weapons, whose wheels are studded with iron plates, which is equipped with excellent horses and a charioteer, which is equipped with an umbrella and a flag, which is equipped with large bells on both sides, in which there is a Nandighosh (the sound of twelve types of instruments) - such a chariot or palanquin when it moves rapidly in the royal court, in the inner apartments or in the courtyard studded with gems, what is the sound like that of those grasses and gems? The Lord said - No / It is even more desirable, radiant, dear, pleasing and beautiful that sound / After this, Shri Gautam Swami mentioned the second simile / It is as follows - O Bhagavan! In the morning or in the evening, the Vaitalika (Mangalpathika) Veena (which is played even without rhythm - when it is equipped with the seventh murcchana called Uttarmanda of the Gandharva note, when the skilled player of that Veena establishes that Veena well in his lap and plays it with a playing stick made of sandalwood essence, then the sound that comes out of that Veena, which satisfies the ears and mind, is that the sound of those grasses and gems? There are seven murcchana of the Gandharva note - Nandi, Y, Khutti, Ma, Puri, Ya or the fourth Asuddhgandhara. Uttar Gandhara is the fifth murcchana // 1 // 

Page #403:
---------------------------
## The Description of the Forest Section:

**(359) The six rules of the Suhmuत्तर are to be understood.**

**(2)**  There are seven Mūrcchanās: Nandī, Kṣudra, Pūrṇā, Śuddhagāndhārā, Uttaragāndhārā, Sūkṣmōttara-āyāma, and Uttaramandā. These Mūrcchanās are significant because they make the singer and the listener feel as if they are in a trance, distinct from other sounds. As it is said, "The Mūrcchanā is said to be a means of making the sound distinct from other sounds. The throat also makes a sound like a trance."

When the Uttaramandā Mūrcchanā, which is within the Gāndhāra svar, reaches its peak, it makes the listeners feel as if they are in a trance. Not only that, but the singer, while performing the specific sounds, also becomes like someone in a trance.

**Is the sound of the Vīnā, which is imbued with the Uttaramandā Mūrcchanā, like the sound of those blades of grass and gems?**

Upon being asked by Śrī Gautama, the Lord says, "No, the sound of those blades of grass and gems is even more pleasing, attractive, dear, delightful, and charming than this sound."

**Again, Śrī Gautama gives a third comparison:**

"O Lord! Is the sound of the Kinnaras, Kimpuruṣas, Mahoragas, or Gandharvas, who reside in the Bhadraśāla forest, Nandana forest, Somanaś forest, Paṇḍaka forest, or who are seated in the caves of the Himāvan mountain, Malaya mountain, or Mandara mountain, who are gathered in one place, sitting facing each other, seated in such a way that they are not hindered by the rubbing of another, and are not hindered by their own limbs, with joy playing on their bodies, who are engaged in play with delight, who have a fondness for song, whose minds are delighted by drama, etc., is the sound of their singing, which is composed of eight types of songs and is accompanied by the qualities of songs mentioned later, free from defects, and imbued with rhythm and beat, like the sound of those blades of grass and gems?"

**There are eight types of songs:**

1. **Gady**: sung with the flow of sounds.
2. **Pady**: in the form of Chanda, etc.
3. **Kathy**: songs with a narrative.
4. **Padabaddha**: in the form of one letter, etc., like "Te".
5. **Pādabaddha**: in the form of the fourth part of a verse.
6. **Utkṣipta**: which is begun first.
7. **Pravartaka**: which is begun from the beginning and is accompanied by an exclamation.
8. **Mandaka**: which is in the middle part, with all the qualities of Mūrcchanā, etc., and is sung with a slow and gentle sound.

**This eight-fold song should have a pleasing ending, i.e., the song should end gradually in a pleasing manner, and should be composed of seven notes.**

**The seven notes of the song are as follows:**

**Saje Risaha Gandhāre Majjhime Pancame Sare**
**Dhevae Ceva Nesāe Sara Satta Viyāhiyā**

**Saḍja, Ṛṣabha, Gāndhāra, Madhyama, Pañcama, Dhaivat, and Naiṣāda, these are the seven notes.**

**These seven notes emerge from the navel region of a man or a woman, as it is said, "Saptasara Nābiyo".**

**Aṣṭaras-Samprāyakta**: This song should be imbued with sentiments like Śṛngāra, etc., and with the essence of the text.

**Ṣaḍdoṣa-Viprāyukta**: This song should be free from six defects.

**These six defects are as follows:**

**Bhiyam Duyama Uppiṭṭham Uttālam Ca Kamaso Muṇeyavvam**
**Kāgasaramāṇuṇāsaṁ Chhaddoṣā Hoti Geyassa**

**These are the six defects of the song.** 

Page #404:
---------------------------
## 360] Within the Jeevajeevaabhigamsutra, there are six defects of singing:  Druta, Uppicch (agitated), Uttala, Kakaswara, and Anunas (singing through the nose).  The eleven qualities of singing are described in detail in the Swaraprabhrut section of the Ekadashagunalankaar Purva.  Currently, the Purva is incomplete, therefore, one should learn about these qualities from the remaining parts of the Purva, such as the Bharata, Vishakhila, and other singing scriptures.  The eight qualities of singing with the eight qualities are as follows:  Punnam, Rattam, Alankiyam, Vattam, Taheva Avighoot, Mahuram, Samam, Sullaliyam.  

1. **Punnam:**  A song that is complete and full of musical notes.
2. **Rattam:**  A song that is sung with passion and attachment to the raga.
3. **Alankiyam:**  A song that is adorned with unique and special musical notes.
4. **Vattam:**  A song where the lyrics and notes are clearly pronounced.
5. **Avighoot:**  A song that is free from dissonance and harshness.
6. **Mahuram:**  A song that is sung with a sweet and melodious voice.
7. **Samam:**  A song that is in harmony with the rhythm, tempo, and notes.
8. **Sullaliyam:**  A song that is pleasing to the ears and sung with a beautiful and refined style.

These are the qualities of a good song.  A song that is sung with three melodious sounds on the flute is called **Gujjanta Vansakuharam**.  A song that is sung with passion and attachment to the raga is called **Rattam**.  A song that is sung with purity from the chest, throat, and head is called **Tristhanakaranashuddha**.  This means that the chest and throat are free from phlegm, and the head is calm and composed.  A song that is sung in harmony with the flute and the stringed instruments is called **Sakuhara Gujjanta Vansatantoususampoutta**.  A song that is sung in harmony with the hand claps is called **Talsusamprayukta**.  A song that is sung in harmony with the rhythm, tempo, and notes of the stringed instruments is called **Talsamam Layasamprayukta Grahasusamprayukta**.  A song that is captivating and enchanting is called **Manoharam**.  A song that is sung with a soft voice and incorporates the notes of the stringed instruments is called **Maduribhitapadasanchaar**.  A song that brings joy and delight to the listeners is called **Suraee**.  A song that is sung with beautiful and graceful gestures is called **Sunati**.  A song that has a unique and beautiful form is called **Varchaaruroopam**.

When the Kinnaras, Kimpurushas, Mahoragas, and Gandharvas sing a song with these qualities, they are filled with joy and delight.  The sound that comes out of their mouths is so beautiful, it is like the sound of the finest jewels and grasses.  Sri Gautam Swami asked, "Is the sound of these jewels and grasses really so beautiful?"  The Lord replied, "Yes, Gautam! The sound of these jewels and grasses is truly beautiful."

380 [Jivajivaabhigamsutra 134. Why, O Venerable One, is it called Vijayadvara?  "O Gotama! In Vijayadvara, there resides a deva named Vijay, who is a Mahiddhio, a Mahjju, and has a great influence, and is in a state of Paligrovamali.  He is the lord of four thousand Samanik devas, four Agrmhisis with their families, three Parsadas, seven Anikas, seven Anikahipatis, and sixteen thousand Atmarakshaka devas.  He is the lord of Vijayadvara, the capital of Vijay, and of many other capitals of Vijay.  He enjoys divine pleasures and delights.  Therefore, O Gotama! it is called Vijayadvara.  O Gotama! The name Vijayadvara is eternal.  It was not in the past, it is not in the present, and it will not be in the future, as long as it exists and is eternal.  [134]  135. (1) Where, O Venerable One, is the capital of Vijay, the deva of Vijay, situated?  "O Gotama!

Saying this, they loudly use the word "Jay-Jaykar". 141. [2] Hearing this from the Devānupriya, Vijayadeva was delighted and pleased, his heart blossomed. He rose from the Devashyaniya and donned the Devadushya pair. Wearing them, he descended from the Devashyaniya and went out through the eastern gate of the Uppapatasabha. He went towards the Hrad (lake) and circumambulated it. Entering through the eastern torana, he descended from the Trisopanapratirupa and entered the water. He performed Jalavagahan (immersion in water) and Jalakrida (water sports). Thus, becoming extremely pure and holy, he emerged from the Hrad and went towards the Abhishekasabha. Circumambulating the Abhishekasabha, he entered through the eastern gate and went towards the throne. He sat on the throne facing the east. [141] (3) Then, the Devānupriya, along with the Devānupriya's Samaniyapariso, said to Vijayadeva, "O Devānupriya! We will perform a great, glorious, and magnificent Abhisheka for you." Hearing this, the Devānupriya, along with the Samaniyapariso, were delighted and pleased. They clasped their hands together, bowed their heads, and said, "O Devānupriya!

[404] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra] When the Samvosahisiddhatha has attained the state of Sarasa Gosi Sachandana, they take it, and by taking it, they reach the Somanasavana. Having reached the Somanasavana, they take the Sarasa Gosi Sachandana, which is divine and fragrant, and by taking it, they reach the Pandagavana. Having reached the Pandagavana, they take the Sarasa Gosi Sachandana, which is divine, fragrant, and has a sweet scent, and by taking it, they all come together.

Quickly prepare for the Maharth (which involves the use of great wealth, including jewels), Mahagh (worthy of great worship), Maharsh (worthy of great celebration), and Vipula Indraabhisheka of Vijayadeva." Upon hearing this, the servants of the Samanika Parshada were overjoyed and their hearts expanded. With folded hands and their palms placed on their heads, they said: "O Deva! Your command is our law." They humbly accepted the command. They go in the northeast direction and, with the power of their Vikriya, they extend their bodies to a distance of countless yojanas (i.e., they extend their bodies outward in the form of a staff, with a height and width of countless yojanas, according to the size of their bodies). They release all kinds of badar pudgalas, including jewels and other precious substances, and they take in the subtle pudgalas. / After that, they again extend their bodies with the power of their Vikriya and create one thousand eight golden kalasas, one thousand eight silver kalasas, one thousand eight kalasas made of jewels, one thousand eight kalasas made of gold and silver, one thousand eight kalasas made of gold and jewels, one thousand eight kalasas made of silver and jewels, one thousand eight earthen kalasas, one thousand eight jhariyas, and similarly, pradarshakas, sthalas, patris, supratisthakas, chitra, ratnakarandakas, pushpachangeriyas, lomahastakachangeriyas, pushpapatlakas, lomahastapatlakas, one hundred eight simhasanas, chatras, chamaras, dhwajas, (vartak, tapasipra, kshauraka, pinaka), telasamudgak, and one hundred eight dhupa kaduchchukas (incense burners).

### Third Incarnation: The Birth and Coronation of Vijaydev

[142] (1)]

(1) Then, Vijaydev, having been crowned with a magnificent Indra-abhisheka, rises from the throne. Rising, he exits through the eastern gate of the abhisheka-sabha and proceeds towards the alankara-sabha. After circumambulating the alankara-sabha, he enters through its eastern gate. Reaching the throne, he sits upon it facing east. 

Thereafter, the gods of Vijaydev's Samanikaparshada summon the Abhiyogi-devas and say, "O Devānupriya! Quickly bring the alankarik-bhaṇḍa (ornaments) for Vijaydev." The Abhiyogi-devas bring the alankarik-bhaṇḍa. 

Then, Vijaydev first wipes his body with a soft, divine, fragrant, and saffron-colored towel. After wiping his body, he applies a fragrant paste of sandalwood to his body. After applying the paste, he adorns himself with a pair of divine, heavenly earrings, which are light as a breath of air, captivating to the eyes, beautiful in color, soft to the touch, softer and whiter than a horse's saliva, with gold threads woven into their edges, as clear as the sky and a crystal gem, and flawless. 

Then, he wears a garland, and a necklace of pearls, a necklace of gold, and a necklace of gems. He wears bracelets, armlets, arm bands, and rings on all ten fingers. He wears a waist belt, a special ornament called a tri-asthi-sutra, a murvi, a kantha-murvi, a pralamba, earrings, a chudamani, and a crown adorned with many kinds of gems. He adorns himself with four types of garlands - granthim, veshtim, purim, and sanghatim - making himself like a Kalpavriksha. Then, he perfumes his body with the fragrant scent of Malay sandalwood and adorns himself with a garland of divine flowers. 

Thereafter, Vijaydev, adorned with four types of ornaments - keshalankara, vastralankara, malyalankara, and abharanalanakara - and fully adorned, rises from the throne. He exits through the eastern gate of the alankara-sabha and proceeds towards the vyavsayasabha. After circumambulating the vyavsayasabha, he enters through its eastern gate. Reaching the throne, he sits upon it facing east. 

Thereafter, the Abhiyogi-devas of Vijaydev bring a book of gems and present it to him. Vijaydev accepts the book of gems, places it on his lap, opens it, and reads it. After reading the book of gems, he understands its religious essence (he desires to perform the duties outlined in it). Then, he places the book of gems there, rises from the throne, and exits through the eastern gate of the vyavsayasabha.

[414] He finds the Nandapushkarini, which is in the Jeeva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra. He circumambulates the Nandapushkarini and enters it through the eastern door. He descends from the three-step-like structure in the east, washes his hands and feet, and takes a large, heavy, white, silver, pure-water-filled vessel shaped like the mouth of a rutting elephant. He takes the lotus flowers there, including the hundred-petaled and thousand-petaled lotuses, and exits the Nandapushkarini. He resolves to go towards the Siddhayatan (and starts going that way). 142. [2] Then, four Saamania-Sahassi, along with many other celestial beings, gods and goddesses, follow Vijayadeva, holding lotuses in their hands, up to (hundred thousand petaled) lotuses. Then, many other celestial beings, gods and goddesses, follow Vijayadeva, holding kalasa (pots) in their hands, up to those holding incense-sticks in their hands. Then, Vijayadeva, along with the four Saamania-Sahassi, along with many other celestial beings, gods and goddesses, enters the Siddhayatan, accompanied by a great sound of conch shells, drums, etc. He enters the Siddhayatan, and while doing so, he makes a gesture of respect with his hands.

(2) Afterwards, four thousand Samanika Devas, along with many other Vanavyantara Devas and Devis, followed Vijaydev. Some carried lotus flowers in their hands, while others carried hundred-petaled or thousand-petaled lotus flowers. Many Abhiyogi Devas and Devis followed Vijaydev, some carrying kalashas in their hands, while others carried incense holders. Then, Vijaydev, accompanied by four thousand Samanika Devas, along with many other Vanavyantara Devas and Devis, surrounded by all kinds of Riddhis and Yuthis, and amidst the sound of musical instruments, reached the Siddhayatana. He circumambulated the Siddhayatana and entered through the eastern gate. He reached the Devachandaka and bowed to the Jina images. He then took a Lomahththa and cleansed the Jina images. He bathed them with fragrant water and wiped their limbs with a divine, fragrant, gandhakaṣāyika (towel). He applied fragrant, sandalwood paste to their bodies. He adorned the Jina images with Akshat, white and divine Devadūṣya-yugala, and worshipped them with the best, primary fragrances and garlands.

Afterwards, he inscribed auspicious symbols in front of the Jina images with clean, white, silver, and shining rice. These auspicious symbols included the swastika, the śrīvatsa, and the mirror. After inscribing these auspicious symbols, he performed the Pushpopachara (flower offering) with five-year-old flowers, taken from the Kachagraha and released from the Karatala. He offered incense with a pure stick, adorned with Chandrakant, Vajra, and Vaidurya gems, and decorated with gold, gems, and various forms of precious stones. The incense was made with the best fragrances of black agarwood, superior kunduruka, and loban. He offered incense with a Vaidurya incense holder, carefully moving back seven or eight steps. He then praised the Jinas with one hundred and eight pure Granthas (word references), containing Mahachandas, meaningful, and non-repetitive stotras. After praising them, he raised his left knee, placed his right knee on the ground, and bowed his head to the ground three times. He then raised his head slightly, contracted his arms, which were supported by his Kataka and Trutita (armlet), joined his hands, placed his palms on his forehead, and said, "Namaskara to the Arihant Bhagavantas, and to all those who have attained the Siddhigatinamasthana."

[Third Incarnation: The Arrival and Coronation of Vijayadev] [419] Then, from there, Vijayadev, with his four thousand Saamanik Devas and sixteen thousand Praayaksha Deva, with all his retinue, accompanied by the sound of drums and cymbals, arrives at the Sudharma Sabha. After circumambulating it, he enters through the eastern gate. Upon entering, he prostrates before the Jina-bones, and then proceeds to the Manipethika, the Maanavak Chaitya-stambha, and the circular receptacles of Vajraratna. He takes a lomahrasta (a whisk made of yak hair) and cleanses these circular receptacles, opening them and then cleansing the Jina-bones within with the lomahrasta. He washes them twenty-one times with fragrant water, applies a paste of sandalwood, and worships them with the finest perfumes and garlands, offering incense. He then places them back in the circular receptacles. He then cleanses the Maanavak Chaitya-stambha with the lomahrasta, sprinkles it with divine water, applies a paste of sandalwood, offers flowers, and places long garlands. He performs a pushpopachara (flower offering) with scattered flowers of five colors, held in his hand and then released. He then offers incense. He then proceeds to the center of the Sudharma Sabha, where the throne is located, and performs the same acts of worship. He then proceeds to the Manipethika and the Devashayaniya, and performs the same acts of worship. He then worships the Ksullaka Mahendra-dhvaja (the flag of the king). He then proceeds to the Chaupalak, the armory, and cleanses the weapons with the lomahrasta, sprinkles them with divine water, applies sandalwood paste, offers flowers, and offers incense. He then proceeds to the southern gate of the Sudharma Sabha and performs the same acts of worship. He then exits through the southern gate. The rest of the narrative should be described like the Siddhayatana, including the worship of the Nandapushkarini in the east. The worship of all the Sabhas should be understood like the Sudharma Sabha. The difference is that in the Upapat Sabha, the worship of the Devashayaniya should be described, and in the other Sabhas, the worship of the thrones should be described. The worship of the Hrad should be described like the Nandapushkarini. In the Vyavsaya Sabha, he cleanses the Pustakarata (the book of knowledge) with the lomahrasta, sprinkles it with divine water, applies sandalwood paste, and worships it with the finest perfumes and garlands. He then cleanses the throne and offers incense. The rest of the narrative should be described as before. The Hrad should be described like the Nandapushkarini. He then proceeds to the Balipith (the sacrificial altar) and performs the same acts of worship. He then calls upon the Abhiyogi Devas and says to them, "O Karna...

## Third Rebirth: The Vaidyant and Other Gates

[423] At the southern end of the Jambudvipa island, north of the salt sea in the south, is the Vaidyant gate. It is eight yojanas high and four yojanas wide. All the descriptions should be the same as those given for the Vijay gate, except that the Vaidyant gate is eternal.

**Lord! Where is the capital city of Vaidyant deva, called Vaidyanti?**

**Gautama!** After crossing countless island seas in the southern direction of the Vaidyant gate, the description should be similar to that of the Vijay gate, until you reach the great deva named Vaidyant.

**Lord! Where is the Jayant gate of Jambudvipa?**

**Gautama!** Forty-five thousand yojanas west of Mount Meru, at the western end of Jambudvipa, east of the salt sea, and beyond the Shitota river, is the Jayant gate of Jambudvipa.

The same description should be given until you reach the great deva named Jayant, whose capital city is located after crossing countless island seas in the western direction of the Jayant gate. The description is similar to that of the Vijay capital.

**Lord! Where is the Aparajit gate of Jambudvipa?**

**Gautama!** Forty-five thousand yojanas north of Mount Meru, at the northern end of Jambudvipa, south of the northern part of the salt sea, is the Aparajit gate of Jambudvipa. Its description is similar to that of the Vijay gate.

Its capital city is located after crossing countless island seas in the northern direction of the Aparajit gate. The description is similar to that of the Vijay capital, until you reach the great deva named Aparajit.

These four capitals are not in this famous Jambudvipa, but in another Jambudvipa.

**145. Lord! What is the distance between these gates of Jambudvipa?**

**Gautama!** The distance between each gate is said to be nineteen thousand fifty-two yojanas and half a yojana. [79052 yojanas and half a yojana]

**Explanation:** The distance between each gate is said to be nineteen thousand fifty-two yojanas and half a yojana. This is explained as follows: Each gate has a branch-like structure [wall] that is one kos thick, and each gate is four yojanas wide. Thus, the total width of the four gates and their walls is fifteen yojanas. The circumference of Jambudvipa is three lakh sixteen thousand two hundred twenty-seven [316227] yojanas, three kos, one hundred eight dhanus, and slightly more than thirteen angulas. 

From this, the total width of the four gates and their branch-like structures is eighteen... 

Page #468:
---------------------------
[424] If the measure of the *jiva-jiva-abhigamsutra* is reduced, the measure of the circumference remains 316209 *yojana*, 3 *kos*, 108 *dhanush* and 13.5 *angula* more. Dividing this into four parts, we get 79052 *yojana*, 1 *kos*, 1532 *dhanush*, 3 *angula* and 3 *yava*. This much should be understood as the distance between one gate and another. This same thing is expressed in the following two verses:

* *Kududuvara-pamanam attarasa jojanai parihe. So hi ya cauhin vibhattam inamo darantaram hoi.* //1//
* *Aunnasiim sahasaa bavanna addhajojanam nanam. Darassa ya darassa ya antarameyam viniddittha.* //2//

[146] O Bhagavan! Is the land of Jambudvipa touched by the salt ocean? Yes, Gautama! It is touched. O Bhagavan! Are those touched lands Jambudvipa or the salt ocean? Gautama! They are Jambudvipa, not the salt ocean. O Bhagavan! Is the land of the salt ocean touched by Jambudvipa? Yes, Gautama! It is touched. O Bhagavan! Are those touched lands the salt ocean or Jambudvipa? Gautama! They are the salt ocean, not Jambudvipa. O Bhagavan! Do beings born in Jambudvipa die and are reborn in the salt ocean? Gautama! Some are reborn, some are not. O Bhagavan! Do beings born in the salt ocean die and are reborn in Jambudvipa? Gautama! Some are reborn, some are not.

---------------------------
## Third Chapter: Why is it called Jambudvipa?

[425 Discussion - The presented sutra asks why the regions touching the salt sea of Jambudvipa are called Jambudvipa or the salt sea? This means, are the extreme regions within their own boundaries called Jambudvipa or the salt sea? Because whatever touches something is called by that name in relation to it, like the country of Magadha, which is connected to Saurashtra, is called Saurashtra. Sometimes, it is not called by that name in relation to something, like the index finger, which touches the middle finger, is not called the index finger. Because both situations exist, this type of question is asked here. In response, the Lord said that the extreme regions touching Jambudvipa belong to Jambudvipa, not the salt sea. The same should be understood about the regions of the salt sea. Regarding the questions about dying in Jambudvipa and being born in the salt sea, and dying in the salt sea and being born in Jambudvipa, it has been said that some beings are born there and some are not, because beings go to different paths due to their various karmas.

Why is it called Jambudvipa? 147. "Why is it called Jambudvipa, Venerable One?" "Gautama, the island called Jambudvipa is located north of Mount Meru, south of the Neelavant mountain, west of the Malavant Vakshkar mountain, and east of the Gandhamadana Vakshkar mountain. There is a region called Uttarakura, which is long from east to west and wide from north to south, shaped like a crescent moon, with a diameter of eleven thousand yojanas, eight hundred and twenty-nine yojanas and nineteen parts of a yojana. 

There are two Vakshkar mountains on either side of this region, one in the east and one in the west. The Vakshkar mountain in the east is located in the east, and the Vakshkar mountain in the west is located in the west. The length of this region is one thousand yojanas. Its circumference is measured as six thousand yojanas, four hundred and eighteen yojanas, twelve yojanas and twenty-one parts of a yojana. 

Venerable One, what is the nature of the Uttarakura region?" "Gautama, it is a region with many beautiful things. It is considered to be a region of the gods, like the Aalingapukhkhara, the Ekkoorayadvipa, and the Devalokapariggaha. 

In this region, six thousand six hundred and sixty-six pitukaranḍas of adumbhatta food are produced every day. It is said that three palis of this food are consumed by the gods, and the remaining part is used for the nourishment of the gods. The rest is used for other purposes. 

In the Uttarakura region, six types of beings live. They are: 1. Pamhagandha, 2. Miyagandha, 3. Amma, 4. Saha, 5. Teyalise, 6. Sanichari." [147]

---------------------------
[426] The Jivajivabhigamasutra is shaped like a semi-circle. Its diameter [width] is eleven thousand eight hundred forty-two yojanas and one part of a yojana [1184211 yojanas]. Its chord is long from east to west. And it touches the Vaksaskar mountains on both sides. It touches the Vaksaskar mountain on the east side from the east end and the Vaksaskar mountain on the west side from the west end. This chord is fifty-three thousand [53000 yojanas] long. The Dhanushprith of this Uttarakura is sixty thousand four hundred eighteen yojanas and one yojana [604181 yojanas] in the south direction. This Dhanushprith is in the form of a circumference. O Bhagavan! What is the shape and form of Uttarakura? Gautama! The land of Uttarakura is very even and beautiful. That land is as flat as the stretched skin of a Mruj-Mridanga [drum]. All the descriptions should be said according to the statement of the Ekoruk island. O Ayushman Shraman! Those humans are born in Devalok after death. The difference is that their height is six thousand Dhanush [three Kos]. They have two hundred and fifty-six ribs. They feel the desire for food after three days. Their lowest state is three Palyopama and their highest state is three Palyopama. They take care of their offspring for 49 days. The rest should be known like the Ekoruk humans. Six types of humans are born in the Uttarakura region, namely 1. Padmagandha, 2. Mrigagandha, 3. Amam, 4. Sah, 5. Teyalis [Tejasvi] and 6. Shanaischari. Discussion - The Uttarakura region is long from east to west and spread [wide] from north to south. Its structure is like a semi-circle like the eighth moon. Its extent is 1184221 yojanas in the north-south direction. It is fructified in this way - In the Mahavideha region, there is a region called Uttarakura to the north of Meru. To the south is Dakshinakura. Therefore, the extent of the Mahavideha region, minus the extent of the Meru mountain, becomes the extent of the chord. When it is halved, the measure that comes is the extent of Dakshinakura and Uttarakura. The extent of the Mahavideha region is 33684 yojanas. In this, the extent of Meru, 10000 yojanas, should be subtracted, then 236843 remains. When it is divided into two parts, it becomes 11842% yojanas. This is the extent of Uttarakura and Dakshinakura. Its chord [Pratyancha] is extended to the north near the Neel Varshadhar mountain and is long from east to west. It touches the Malavant Vaksaskar mountain from its east end and the Gandhamadana Vaksaskar mountain from its west end. This chord is 53000 [fifty-three thousand] yojanas long. The measure of its length is fructified in this way - The length of each of the Bhadrashal forests in the east and west directions of the Meru mountain is 22000 [twenty-two thousand] yojanas, both together become 44000 yojanas. When the diameter of the Meru mountain, 10000 [ten thousand] yojanas, is added to it, it becomes 54000 [fifty-four thousand] yojanas. From this measure, both 1. 'Vaideha Vikkhamba Mandar Vikkhamba Sohiyapaddatan Kuruvikkhambam Janasu'. 2. 'Mandarpuvvenaayaaya Viseshasahas Bhaisala Vanam Dugunam Madaramhiyam Dusela Rahiyam Cha Kurujiva'.

## The Third Question: Why is Jambudvipa called Jambudvipa?

[427 Bakshaskar mountains, subtracting 500-500 yojanas of their height, leaves 36,000 yojanas. This is the measure of the Jeeva. The Dhanushprith (arc) of the Uttarakurus is 6,041,813 yojanas to the south. The length of the Gandhamadana and Malyaavant Bakshaskar mountains is the same as the Dhanushprith (circumference) of the Uttarakurus. The Gandhamadana and Malyaavant mountains each measure 30,209 yojanas. The total measure of both is 60,418 yojanas. This is the measure of the Dhanushprith of the Uttarakurus.

When asked about the nature of the Uttarakuru region, the Sutrakar has exaggerated the description of the Ekoruk island. That is, one should know that all descriptions are similar to the aforementioned Ekoruk island. The Sutrakar has explicitly revealed the difference through a Sutra, which is as follows: "The people of Uttarakuru are six thousand Dhanush (three Kos) long, they have 256 ribs, they desire food after an interval of three days, their lifespan is from a fraction of a Palyopamasankhyeya to three Palyopamas in the lowest state and three Palyopamas in the highest state, and they nurture their offspring for 49 days." One should know the rest of the description of the people of Ekoruk island according to the description, as these people die and go to Devaloka.

There are six types of people in the Uttarakurus, based on their caste: 1. Padmagandha (those with the fragrance of lotus), 2. Mrigagandha (those with the fragrance of deer), 3. Amam (those without attachment), 4. Sah (those who are tolerant), 5. Teyalise (those who are radiant), and 6. Shanaischari (those who walk slowly).

According to the Vritti, the following three verses summarize the topics discussed regarding the Uttarakuru region:

"Ishoo Jeeva Dhanuprith, Bhoomi Gumma, Heruudala,
Tilgalayaavanrai, Rukkha, Manuya, Ahare." / 1 /

"Geha, Gama, Hirannaraya, Das, Maya,
Parivarie, Mittre, Vivaah, Mah, Natra, Sagda." / 2 /

"Aasa, Gaavo, Siha, Sali, Khaanu, Gaddadansahi,
Gahjuddh, Rogathi, Uvvattana, Anusajjana Chev." / 3 /

The meaning of the above verses is as follows: First, the Ishoo, Jeeva, and Dhanushprith are discussed regarding the Uttarakuru. Then, there is a statement about the land, followed by a description of the Gulma, then the description of forests like Herutal, then the description of trees like Uddal, then the description of trees like Tilka, creepers, and forest kings.

1. "Aayamo Selanam Donhvi Miligo Kurunadhanu Pudhe."
2. The Vrittikar has provided a detailed explanation of the form, nature, and evolution of the Uttarakuru, along with the original text. This suggests that the original manuscripts available to them must have contained a complete description in the original text. The currently available manuscripts contain an exaggerated text. Where the Sutrakar has described the Ekoruk island, the Vrittikar has not explained it, but has simply written that the explanation of the Uttarakuru should be understood here. The point to consider here is why the Vrittikar has exaggerated the topic to be discussed later? 

Page #472:
---------------------------
[428] After the Jeevajeevaabhigamsutra, there is a description of 10 types of Kalpavruksha. After that, there is a description of the humans, women, and both men and women there. After that, there is a sutra on food. After that, there is a description of the house-shaped trees. After that, it is said that there is no house, village, weapon, gold, king, servant, mother, enemy, friend, marriage, festival dance, or vehicle there. After that, it is said that there are horses, cows, lions, and other animals, but they are not used by humans or cause them any harm. After that, there are sutras prohibiting the consumption of rice, etc., sutras prohibiting the consumption of stationary objects, etc., sutras prohibiting the consumption of pits, dances, mosquitoes, etc., and then it is said that there are snakes, etc., but they do not cause any harm. After that, it is said that there is no misfortune related to planets, no wars, and no diseases. After that, the state, upward movement, and origin are described. [148] "Where, sir, are the two mountains called Jamga in the Uttarakura?" "Sir, in the Uttarakura, there are two mountains called Jamga, located on both sides of the Neelavant's Vasahar mountain, 34 yojanas to the south, 4 and 7/8 yojanas to the north, and 1 yojana to the east and west. Each mountain is 1,000 yojanas high, 100 yojanas wide at the base, 1,000 yojanas long and wide at the base, 100 yojanas long and wide in the middle, and 100 yojanas long and wide at the top.

## Third Question: Why is Jambudvipa called Jambudvipa? [148]

O Bhagavan! Where are the two mountains called Yamaka located in the region called Uttar Kuru?

Gautama! Eight hundred and thirty-four yojanas south of the Neelavant Varshadhar mountain, and one yojana further, on both the eastern and western banks of the great river Shita, in the Uttar Kuru region, are located two mountains called Yamaka. These mountains are each one thousand yojanas high, two hundred and fifty yojanas deep in the earth, one thousand yojanas long and wide at the base, seven hundred and fifty yojanas long and wide in the middle, and five hundred yojanas in diameter at the top. Their circumference at the base is slightly more than three thousand one hundred and sixty-two yojanas. Their circumference in the middle is slightly more than two thousand three hundred and seventy-two yojanas, and their circumference at the top is slightly more than fifteen hundred and eighty-one yojanas. They are wide at the base, narrow in the middle, and thin at the top. They are shaped like a peacock's tail, entirely golden, clean, smooth, and perfect in form. Each mountain is surrounded by a lotus-shaped platform, and each mountain is adorned with a forest. The description of both should be given.

Above these Yamaka mountains is a very beautiful land. Its description should be given, as many Vanavyantar Devas and Devis reside, lie down, and wander there, experiencing the fruits of their good deeds. In the middle of these two beautiful lands are two separate Prasadaavatansakas. These Prasadaavatansakas are sixty-two and a half yojanas high and thirty-one yojanas and one kos wide. They are sky-touching and high, etc. Their description should be given. The description of their land, upper inner ceilings, etc., should be known as before. There is a Mani-pithika of two yojanas there. On it is a superior throne. These thrones are complete, meaning they are equipped with the comfortable seats of the Samanika Devas, etc. The Yamaka Devas sit on them.

O Bhagavan! Why are these Yamaka mountains called Yamaka mountains?

Gautama! On these Yamaka mountains, there are many small wells here and there, as well as burrows. In them are many lotus flowers, as well as Shatapatra-Sahasrapatra, which are shaped like Yamaka (a type of bird), have the same color as Yamaka, and two great, wealthy Devas reside there, who are in the state of Palyopama. These Devas reside there, ruling over their four thousand Samanika Devas, as well as the Yamaka mountains, the Yamaka capitals, and many other Vanavyantar Devas and Devis, and they nurture them. Therefore, O Gautama! These Yamaka mountains are called Yamaka mountains.

Another thing, O Gautama! These Yamaka mountains are eternal, meaning they are permanent. [Meaning, their name 'Yamaka' is eternal - it has always been and will always be.]

O Bhagavan! Where are the capitals called Yamaka of these Yamaka Devas?

Gautama! North of these Yamaka mountains, after crossing countless islands and seas, in another Jambudvipa different from the famous Jambudvipa, twelve thousand yojanas further, are the capitals called Yamaka of the Yamaka Devas, which are twelve thousand yojanas in size, etc. All descriptions should be given as for the Vijaya capital, as two great, wealthy Devas called Yamaka are their rulers. For this reason, these Yamaka Devas are called Yamaka Devas.

---------------------------
[149] (1) Bhagavan! Where is the lake called Neelavant located in the Uttarakuru region?  _ Gautam! In the south of the Yamaka mountains, eight hundred and thirty-four yojanas and four and seven-eighths yojanas further, in the middle of the Sita Mahanadi, the lake called Neelavant in the Uttarakuru region is said to be located. It is long from north to south and wide from east to west  /  It is one thousand yojanas long and five hundred yojanas wide. It is ten yojanas high [deep], clear, smooth, with silver banks, it is a four-sided square, even and symmetrical, as far as its form goes  /  It is surrounded on both sides by lotus-shaped platforms and forest tracts on all sides  /  The description of both should be given here. In the lake called Neelavant, many three-tiered platforms are said to be located here and there. Their description should be given up to the torana. In the middle of that Neelavant lake, a large lotus is said to be located  /  That lotus is one yojana long and one yojana wide. Its circumference is three times this plus a little more. Its

---------------------------
## The Third Question: Why is it called Ambudvipa?

[431] Its thickness is half a yojana. It is ten yojanas underwater and two kosas [half a yojana] above water. Together, its height is ten and a half yojanas. The description of the lotus is as follows: its root is vajra-like, its stem is made of risht gems, its stalk is made of vaidurya gems, its outer petals are vaidurya-like, its inner petals are jambunad [golden], its filaments are made of tapaniya gold, its pollen is golden, and its stigma is made of various gems. The pollen is half a yojana long and wide, its circumference is three times that plus some, its thickness is one kosa, it is completely golden, pure, smooth, and perfect. Above the pollen is a multi-splendid land, its description should be given up to the touch of the gems. In the exact middle of that multi-splendid land is a vast building, one kosa long, half a kosa wide, and slightly less than one kosa high. It is supported by hundreds of pillars, the initial description should be given. There are three doors in that building, one in the east, one in the south, and one in the north. These doors are five hundred dhanus high, two hundred and fifty dhanus wide, and their entrance is the same. They are white, adorned with a stupa of the finest gold, and garlands are hanging from them. 

[149. (2)] Inside that building, in the multi-splendid land, there are ponds, lakes, and the color of the gems. In the middle of that multi-splendid land, there is a gem-studded platform, five hundred dhanus long and wide, eight hundred dhanus thick, and made of sixty gems. On that gem-studded platform, there is a great divine bed, the description of the divine bed is as follows. It is surrounded on all sides by four other beds, each of which is half the size of the main bed. These beds are half a yojana long and wide, their circumference is three times that plus some, their thickness is one kosa, and they are ten yojanas high, with one kosa of water above them. These ten yojanas are considered to be the height of the beds. The description of these beds is as follows: their roots are vajra-like, their stems are made of risht gems, their stalks are made of vaidurya gems, their outer petals are vaidurya-like, their inner petals are jambunad [golden], their filaments are made of tapaniya gold, their pollen is golden, and their stigma is made of various gems. These pollens are one kosa long and wide, their circumference is three times that plus some, their thickness is half a kosa, they are completely golden, pure, smooth, and perfect. Above these pollens is a multi-splendid land, its description should be given up to the color, fragrance, and touch of the gems. 

Above that bed, in the north, in the north-northwest, there are four thousand beds, each of which is equal to the size of the four thousand beds of the Kumar of Nilavantaha. Thus, the entire family should be described in terms of its size. These beds are surrounded on all sides by three other beds, namely the inner, middle, and outer beds. In the inner bed, there are thirty-two thousand beds, in the middle bed, there are forty thousand beds, and in the outer bed, there are forty-eight thousand beds. Thus, with all the beds, there are one hundred million beds and twenty thousand beds. 

Where is this, Venerable? It is said that Nilavantaha, Nilavantaha?

[432] [Jivajovaabhigamsutra Goyama! Neelavanthahahe nam dahe tatya tatya jaim uppalai jav sayasahasrapattai Neelavantppabhai Neelavanthahahekumarae ya so cheva gamo jav Neelavanthahahe Neelavanthahahe. [149] [2] That building is called a Bahusamaramaneya Bhoomibhag. It is as smooth as leather stretched over a drum [Murja-Mridanga] and should be described as such. This description should be done as before, including the color, smell, and touch of the jewels. In the exact middle of that Bahusamaramaneya Bhoomibhag is a Manipithika, which is five hundred Dhanus long and wide and two hundred and fifty Yojan thick and made of all jewels. Above that Manipithika is a vast Devashayaniya, which should be described as before. It is surrounded on all sides by one hundred and eight lotuses. Those lotuses are half the height of that lotus. Those lotuses are half a Yojan long and wide and their circumference is slightly more than three times that. Their thickness is one Kos. They are submerged in water for ten Yojan [deep and one Kos high from the water level]. From the water level to the top, they are slightly more than ten Yojan [one Kos more]. The form of those lotuses is described as follows: their roots are made of Vajraratnas, and their petals are made of various jewels. The lotus seeds are one Kos long and wide, and their circumference is slightly more than three times that, and their thickness is half a Kos. They are all made of gold, and they are pure and perfect. Above those seeds is the Bahusamaramaneya Bhoomibhag, and the color, smell, and touch of the jewels should be described. To the northwest, north, and northeast of that lotus are four thousand Padmas [lotus-shaped seats] of the four thousand Samanik Devas of the Nagakumaraendra Nagakumara Raja of the Neelavantdrah. Similarly, the Padmas [lotus-shaped seats] of all the families should be described. That lotus is surrounded on all sides by three other Padmavaraparिक्षेप परिवेश. Those परिवेश are: Prabhyantara, Madhyama, and Bahya. The Prabhyantara Padma Parivesh has thirty-two lakh Padmas, the Madhyama Padma Parivesh has forty lakh Padmas, and the Bahya Padma Parivesh has forty-eight lakh Padmas. Thus, the total number of Padmas is one crore twenty lakh. O Bhagavan! Why is Neelavantdrah called Neelavantdrah? Gautama! In Neelavantdrah, there are blue lotuses [Utpala Kamalas] blooming here and there, including those with a hundred petals and a thousand petals. And there lives a great Dev named Neelavant, the Nagakumaraendra Nagakumara Raja. Therefore, Neelavantdrah is called Neelavantdrah. [After this, according to the Vritti, there is a Sutra about the Neelavanta Rajadhani of Neelavantkumar. It should be described like the Vijaya Rajadhani.] The authority of the Kanchan Parvatas 150. Neelavantddahass nam purathim-paccharithamenam dasa joyanai abahaar esth gam dasa dasa kanchanam apadhwaya pannatta. Te nam kanchanagapamvaya egamegam joyanasayam uddham uchchattanenam, panavinsam panavinsam pannasam joyanai unhenam, mule egamegam joyanasayam vikkhambhenam majjhe pannari joyanai vikkhambhenam uri 1. The text about the Rajadhani seems to be missing in the available copies. According to the Vritti, there should be a text about the Rajadhani.

## The Third Question: What is Jambudvipa?

[433 yojanas in circumference at the base, 316 yojanas plus a little more in the middle, 277 yojanas plus a little more in the upper part; wide at the base, narrow in the middle, and thin at the top, shaped like a cow's tail, entirely made of gold, pure, with pavaravedika and forest areas around each one. On top of these are many beautiful land areas where many Vanavyantara gods and goddesses reside. On each of these land areas are what are called Prasadavatsankas. These Prasadavatsankas are 62 and a half yojanas high and 31 yojanas wide. They have two yojana wide mani-pithikas and thrones. These thrones are complete with families, meaning they have Samanikadevas, chief queens, and other family members, all seated on auspicious thrones.  

O Bhagavan! Why are these called Kanchanaparbata? 

Gautama! In the ponds of these Kanchanaparbata, there are many utpala and kamala, even satapatra and sahasrapatra kamala, which have the radiance and color of gold. And there reside great gods named Kanchanaka. Therefore, these are called Kanchanaparbata. 

The Kanchanika of these Kanchanaka gods...

---------------------------
[434] The **Jivajivaabhigamsutra** mentions the capitals of the **Kanchanak** mountains, which are located in another **Jambudvipa** after crossing countless islands and seas to the north. This description should be understood like the description of the **Vijaya** capital.  O Lord, where is the **Uttarakurudrah** of the **Uttarakuru** region mentioned?  Gautam! The **Uttarakurudrah** is located eight hundred and thirty-four yojanas south of the **Neelavantdrah**, and all descriptions should be understood like the description of the **Neelavantdrah**.  All **drahs** have deities with the same name.  All **drahs** have ten **Kanchanak** mountains to the east and west, with similar characteristics.  Their capitals are located in another **Jambudvipa** after crossing countless islands and seas to the north.  Their description should be understood like the description of the **Vijaya** capital.  Similarly, the same statements should be made about the **Chandradrah**, **Eravantdrah**, and **Malavantdrah**.

**Jambuvriksha Vaktvyata 151.**  Where, O Venerable One, is the **Jambupedha** named **Jambusudansana** located in the **Uttarakura**?  Gotama!  In the **Jambudvipa**, to the north-west of the **Mandara** mountain, to the south of the **Neelavant** mountain, to the south-east of the **Malavant** mountain, and to the east of the **Gandhamadana** mountain, on the eastern bank of the **Sita** river, there is the **Jambupedha** named **Uttarakura**.  It is five hundred yojanas in length and breadth, fifteen hundred and one yojanas in circumference, with a slight excess, and twelve yojanas wide in the middle.  Then, gradually, it becomes narrower, and finally, it is two kosas wide at the ends.  It extends throughout the **Jambudvipa**, from one end to the other.  It is surrounded on all sides by a single **Paumvaraveiya** and a single **Vanasanda**.  Its color is two-fold.  The **Jambupedha** has four **Tisovanapidiruva** on all four sides, which extend from the **Torana** to the **ChhataiChhatai**.  The **Jambupedha** has a very beautiful land area, which extends from the **Aalingapukkhara** to the **Manin** **Phaso**.  In the middle of this very beautiful land area, there is a large **Manipedhiya**, eight yojanas in length and breadth, and four yojanas wide.  It is made of **Mani** and extends from one end to the other.  On top of this **Manipedhiya**, there is a large **Jambusudansana**, eight yojanas high, half a yojana in diameter, two yojanas in width, eight yojanas in breadth, and six yojanas in circumference.  In the middle, it is eight yojanas in breadth, and eight yojanas in circumference.  It has **Vairamaya** roots, **Rayyasupitthiya** circumference, **Cheiyarrushka** color, **Ritthamaya** leaves, **Veruliya** branches, **Sujaya** flowers, **Varajayaruva** first leaves, **Visalasala** leaves, **Nanamanirayana** various ornaments, **Sahuppasahave** **Veruliya** leaves, **Pattatvanijja** leaves, **Pattvita** leaves, **Jambunayaratta** leaves, **Uyasukumal** leaves, **Paval** leaves, **Pallavankura** leaves, **Vichittama** **Nirayana** flowers, **Surahi** flowers, **Phalabharana** fruits.  It is full of shade, beautiful, fragrant, and bright.  It is very beautiful to look at, and it is very pleasant to be near.

## Third Chapter: The Jambū Tree

**[435 [151]]**  O Bhagavan! Where is the Jambūpīṭha, the seat of the Jambū tree, also known as Sudarśanā, in the Uttarakuru region?

O Gautama! In the northeast [Īśānakoṇa] of the Meru mountain in Jambūdvīpa, south of the Nīlavant Varṣadhara mountain, west of the Mālavant Vakṣaskāra mountain, east of the Gandhamādana Vakṣaskāra mountain, on the eastern bank of the Śītā Mahānādī river, lies the Jambūpīṭha, a seat in the Uttarakuru region. It is five hundred yojanas long and wide, with a circumference of slightly more than fifteen hundred eighty-one yojanas. It is twelve yojanas wide in the middle, gradually decreasing in width due to the loss of land, and finally becoming two kosas thick at the ends. It is entirely made of Jambūnanda [gold], pure and perfect. This Jambūpīṭha is surrounded on all sides by a Padmavaravedikā and a forest. Both should be described.

Above this Jambūpīṭha is a very beautiful land, as smooth as the stretched leather of a Mṛdanga [drum], and the description should be given as before, up to the touch of the jewels. In the exact middle of this beautiful land is a large Mani-pīṭhikā, eight yojanas long and wide, and four yojanas thick. It is made of jewels, pure, smooth, and perfect. Above this Mani-pīṭhikā is the large Jambū tree, Sudarśanā [also known as Sudarśanā Apara Jambū], the Jambūvakṣa. This Jambū tree is eight yojanas high, half a yojana deep in the ground, two yojanas in its trunk, eight yojanas wide, its branches extend six yojanas, it is eight yojanas wide in the middle, and more than eight yojanas [eight and a half yojanas] high, including the height of the roots and the top.

Its branches are bent down by the weight of the fruits. This Jambū tree is beautiful, with a beautiful glow, beauty, radiance, and gives great satisfaction to the mind. It is magnificent, beautiful, and perfect.

1. The commentator mentions a different opinion, saying, "Others say that its roots and branches are made of Suvarna [gold], and its sub-branches are made of Rajata [silver]." Others say that its top branches, buds, and shoots are made of Jambūnanda [gold], and its leaves are made of Rajata [silver].

## Third Chapter: Why is it called Jambudvipa?

[441] "Tell me, Venerable One! How is the equality of the Anadrita to be spoken of?" "It is indeed a good question, Gautama! In Jambudvipa, in various places, there are many Jamburuksha, Jambavana, and Jambavana-khanda, which are always in bloom and adorned with splendor. Therefore, Gautama, it is called Jambudvipa."

"It is indeed a good question, Gautama! The name Jambudvipa is eternal. It was not in the past, it is not in the present, and it will not be in the future. It is eternal."

[152-4] The Jambudvipa is surrounded on all sides by many Tilaka trees, Lakuta trees, Raya trees, and Hingu trees. Above the Jambudvipa, there are many auspicious symbols like eight-pointed Swastikas, Srivatsas, mirrors, black chowries, flags, and umbrellas. All this should be known as before.

The Jambudvipa has twelve names: 1. Sudarshana, 2. Amoha, 3. Suprabuddha, 4. Yashodhara, 5. Videhajambu, 6. Saumanasya, 7. Niyata, 8. Nityamandita, 9. Subhadra, 10. Vishala, 11. Sujata, 12. Sumana. These are the twelve synonyms of the Sudarshana Jambudvipa.

"Venerable One! Why is the Jambudvipa called Jambudvipa?" "Gautama! In the Jambudvipa, the lord of Jambudvipa, the great god Anadrita, resides. He has a position of one Palyopama. He rules over the Jambudvipa, the Jambusudarshana, and the capital city of Anadrita, along with four thousand Samanika gods."

"Venerable One! Where is the capital city of Anadrita?" "Gautama! The complete description of the Vijaya capital city, which was mentioned earlier, should be spoken here. The great god Anadrita resides there."

"Gautama! Another reason is that in the island called Jambudvipa, there are Jamburuksha, Jambavana, and Jambavana-khanda in various places, which are always in bloom and adorned with splendor. Therefore, Gautama, it is called Jambudvipa."

"It is also a reason that Jambudvipa is an eternal name. It was not in the past, it is not in the present, and it will not be in the future. It is eternal."

The commentary presented in this sutra mentions twelve names of the Jambudvipa. These names are meaningful and carry specific connotations. The meaning of these names is as follows:

1. Sudarshana - It is called Sudarshana because it is extremely beautiful and pleasing to the eyes.
2. Amoha - It is called Amoha because it fulfills its name. The lordship of Jambudvipa is meaningful and successful only because of it, otherwise not. Therefore, it is called Amoha, a name with such meaning.
3. Suprabuddha - It is always shining with jewels, gold, and gems, therefore it is called Suprabuddha, awake and not asleep. 

Page #486:
---------------------------
[442] [Jivanivabhigam Sutra 4. Yashodhara - Because of this, the fame of Jambudvipa is spread throughout the three worlds, therefore it is appropriate to call it Yashodhara. 5. Videhajambhu - Because it is located in the Uttarakurushetra of Jambudvipa under Videha, it is called Videha. 6. Saumanasya - Because it is the cause of happiness of the mind, it is called Saumanasya. 7. Niyata - Because it is always present, it is called Niyata. 8. Nityamandita - Because it is always adorned with ornaments, it is called Nityamandita. 9. Subhadra - It is always auspicious. Because its presiding deity is Mahaddhik Deva, it is never troubled. 10. Vishala - Because it is vast, measuring many yojanas, it is called Vishala. 11. Sujata - Because it is made of pure gems, gold, and jewels, it is called Sujata - free from birth defects. 12. Sumana - Because it makes the mind beautiful, it is called Sumana. According to the Vattikar, the order of these names is as follows: 1. Sudarshana, 2. Amogha, 3. Suprabuddha, 4. Yashodhara, 5. Subhadra, 6. Vishala, 7. Sujata, 8. Sumana, 9. Videhajambhu, 10. Saumanasya, 11. Niyata, 12. Nityamandita. The reasons for calling Jambudvipa as Jambudvipa are as follows: (1) Because it is marked by the Jambhu tree, it is called Jambudvipa. (2) Because there are many Jambhu trees, Jambhuvana, and Jambhuvanakhanda in the Uttarakuru region of Jambudvipa, it is also called Jambudvipa. A community of trees of the same species is called a forest, and a group of trees of different species is called a forest tract. (3) Because the name Jambhu is eternal, it is also called Jambudvipa. In Jambudvipa, the number of moons, etc. is 152. In Jambudvipa, O Venerable! How many moons shine, are shining, or will shine? How many suns are shining, are shining, or will shine? How many stars twinkle, are twinkling, or will twinkle? How many great planets wander, are wandering, or will wander? How many kodi-kodi stars shine, are shining, or will shine? _ Gotama! In Jambudvipa, there are two moons that shine, are shining, or will shine. There are two suns that shine, are shining, or will shine. There are fifty-six stars that twinkle, are twinkling, or will twinkle. There are seventy-six planets that wander, are wandering, or will wander. There are one hundred thousand, thirty-three thousand, nine hundred and fifty kodi-kodi stars that shine, are shining, or will shine. // 1 // 

Page #487:

## Third Chapter: Why is it called Jambudvipa?

153. O Bhagavan! How many moons shone, shine, and will shine in the island called Jambudvipa? How many suns blazed, blaze, and will blaze? How many constellations (along with the moon) made conjunctions, make conjunctions, and will make conjunctions? How many great planets moved, move, and will move in the sky? How many Kodakodi star groups shone, shine, and will shine?

Gautama! Two moons shone, shine, and will shine in Jambudvipa. Two suns blazed, blaze, and will blaze. Fifty-six constellations made conjunctions with the moon, make conjunctions, and will make conjunctions. One hundred and seventy-six great planets moved, move, and will move in the sky. One lakh thirty-three thousand nine hundred and fifty Kodakodi star groups shone, shine, and will shine in the sky.

**End of the description of Jambudvipa**

1. **Six thousand two hundred and ninety-five, five hundred, one hundred and one. This is the family of the Kodakodi star group.**

**[Chapter on Unfavorable Times for Study]**

**445. Thunder and lightning are often due to the nature of the season. Therefore, from the constellation Prādrā to Svāti, it is not considered an unfavorable time for study.**

**5. Nirghāta - When there is a loud roar in the sky without clouds, or when there is thunder with clouds, it is an unfavorable time for study for two praharas.**

**6. Yūpaka - In the bright fortnight, the first, second, and third days, the meeting of the evening glow and the moonlight is called Yūpaka. On these days, one should not study from the evening until night.**

**7. Yakṣādīpta - When there is a light like lightning in a particular direction, which appears intermittently, it is called Yakṣādīpta. Therefore, one should not study as long as this light appears in the sky.**

**8. Dhūmikā - From the dark fortnight of Kārttika to Māgha, it is the time of the gestation of clouds. During this time, a fine, water-like mist of a smoky color falls. This is called Dhūmikā-Kṛṣṇa. One should not study as long as this mist falls.**

**9. Mihikāśveta - In winter, a fine, water-like mist of white color falls, which is called Mihikā. One should not study as long as this falls.**

**10. Raja-Udghāta - Due to the wind, dust spreads all over the sky. One should not study as long as this dust remains spread.**

**The above ten reasons are related to the sky and are unfavorable for study. The following ten reasons are related to the body and are unfavorable for study.**

**11-12-13. Bones, Flesh, and Blood - If the bones, flesh, and blood of a five-sensed animal are visible, it is an unfavorable time for study until these things are removed from there. The commentator considers it an unfavorable time for study if these things are present within 60 cubits around. Similarly, the bones, flesh, and blood of a human being are also considered unfavorable for study. The difference is that the unfavorable time for these is up to 100 cubits and for one day and night. The unfavorable time for a woman's menstrual period is three days. The unfavorable time for the birth of a boy and a girl is seven and eight days respectively.**

**14. Impure Excrement - It is an unfavorable time for study until the excrement is visible.**

**17. Solar Eclipse - During a solar eclipse, it is also considered an unfavorable time for study for eight, twelve, and sixteen praharas respectively.**

##  Translation:

**46]** **[Anadhyayakala 18. Patan—** When a great king or a national leader dies, one should not perform *svadhyaya* until his cremation is completed.  Or, one should gradually resume *svadhyaya* only after another official takes over the reins of power. **19. Rajavyagraha—** When neighboring kings are engaged in war, one should not perform *svadhyaya* until peace is restored. Even after peace is established, one should refrain from *svadhyaya* for one day and night. **20. Audarik Sharira—** When a five-sense being dies within a dwelling, one should not perform *svadhyaya* as long as the body remains there. If the lifeless body remains within a radius of 100 hands, *svadhyaya* should be avoided. These ten reasons for avoiding *svadhyaya* are related to the audarik body. **21-28. Char Mahotsav and Char Mahapratipada—** The four full moon days of Prashdha, Ashwin, Kartik, and Chaitra are considered *Mahotsav* (great festivals). The first day (Pratipada) following these full moon days is called *Mahapratipada*. *Svadhyaya* is prohibited on these days. **29-32. Pratah, Sayam, Madhyahn and Ardharatri—** One hour before and one hour after sunrise, one hour before and one hour after sunset, one hour before and one hour after midday, and one hour before and one hour after midnight, *svadhyaya* should be avoided.

The *Jivajivaabhigamsutra* mainly describes in detail the state of the *jiva* in various situations. It briefly provides a glimpse of the numerous states of the *jiva* and solves all related queries. It is a means of providing detailed understanding for ordinary readers. This edition, as per the defined framework, includes the original text along with its meaning in Hindi and necessary discussions for clarification. Due to this, the book became quite extensive and hence is being published in two parts. The first part was published earlier and this is the second part. The translation, discussion, and editing of the book has been done by the Up-Pravartak Shri Rajendramuni Ji M.A., Ph.D. He had also edited the *Uttaraadhyaayana Sutra*. The *Aetardh* committee considers him as its senior associate and extends its heartfelt congratulations. The great scholar, young Acharya Shri Mishrimal Ji "Madhukar" Muni Ji M. had initiated the sacred ritual to make the entire *Bhagam* literature accessible to the public. It is a matter of regret that his direct presence is no longer there, but his indirect blessings have always been received by the committee. This is the reason why the committee has been progressing in its work and now we are confident to state that the publication work of *Pragam Battisi* is almost complete. Finally, we are grateful to all our collaborators for their dedication and inspiration, due to which the publication work is about to be completed. Ratanchand Modi, Acting President, Sayarmal Chordia, General Secretary, Shri Aagam Prakashan Samiti, Byawar (Raj.) Amarchand Modi, Minister.

The editorial continuity of the omniscient, all-seeing, passionless Supreme Being, Jineswar Deva's nectar-like, path-showing, words are not only a priceless treasure of the world's religious literature, but also a life-saving elixir for the lives of all beings. This discourse, preached by the Arihants, is that pot of nectar which removes all poisons and provides new life to all beings in the world. The origin of the Jain Agamas is for the protection of the world's beings, in the form of compassion. Non-violence, compassion, kindness, affection, and friendship are its essence. Therefore, it is the most beneficial, protective, and helpful for the beings of the world. This Jain discourse is a form of salvation, refuge, motion, and foundation for all beings. The ancient teachers have compared this Agamvani to the ocean. They said, "This Jain Agam is like a great ocean, it is boundless in knowledge, filled with the best word-community-like water, it is vast in extent due to being agitated by the endless waves of non-violence, the tide-like Chula is rising in it, it is filled with the gems obtained by the grace of the Guru. It is difficult to cross. It is the ultimate essence and auspicious form. One should worship the ocean of the Agam of the great Mahavira with devotion." Indeed, the Jain Agam is vast and deep like the ocean. However, with the grace of the Guru and effort, one can dive into it and obtain the essential gems. The essence of the Jina discourse is non-violence and equality. As it is said in the Sutra Kritanga Sutra, "Do not harm any living being, considering them as your own self, this is the essence of religion, the path of self-welfare." Jain principles are interwoven with non-violence, and in today's world, which is burning in the fire of hatred, the endless stream of non-violence is the only benefit. Therefore, the reading, study, and practice of Jain principles and their widespread dissemination is the priority of today's age. Only by practicing non-violence is there a possibility of world peace, therefore, the study and practice of the Jain Agams, which are full of non-violence, is absolutely essential. The Jain Agam is in the form of the twelve-part Ganipitaka. After attaining omniscience, the Arihant Tirthankara Supreme Being, in the form of words, formulates the discourse, and their fourteen predecessors, the Ganadharas, who are repositories of vast wisdom, bind them in the form of sutras. In this way, the tradition of discourse continues. Therefore, the originator of the Agam in the form of words, the Sri Tirthankara Supreme Being, 1. Savvajagajivarakhkhnadayattayae, Bhagavaya Pavayanam Kahiyam - Prashnavyakaran 2. Bodhaagadhham Supapadavi Nirpurabhiram, Jiwahimsa Aviralhari Sangamaagahadeham / Chulaavelam Gurugamamanisankulam Duracharam, 'Saram Viragamajalnidhi Sadaram Sadhu Seve / /

And the author of the word-form *Magam* is Ganadhara. From time immemorial, the tradition of Arihants and their Ganadharas has been continuing. Therefore, the tradition of their teachings in the form of *Magam* has also been continuing since time immemorial. Therefore, it is said that this *Dwadashangi* is firm, eternal, everlasting, has always been, never was, is not, will never be. In terms of feelings, it is firm, eternal, everlasting. *Dwadashangi* includes twelve parts. *Acharang*, *Suyagdang*, *Thanang*, *Samvayang*, *Vyakhyaprajnapti*, *Jatadharmakatha*, *Upasakadasha*, *Antakridadasha*, *Anuttaroppapatik*, *Prashnavyakaran*, *Vipaksutra* and *Dastibad*, these are the twelve parts. This is the *Dwadashangi* *Ganipitaka*, which is directly taught by the Tirthankaras. These are called *Angapravisht* *Pagam*. In addition to these, *Anangapravisht*-*Angabahya* *Agam* are those which are composed by the venerable *Bhagavants* who are endowed with *prashatishya* and are not contradictory to the words of the Tirthankaras. Thus, *Jainagam* is divided into two parts - *Angapravisht* and *Anangapravisht* (*Angabahya*). The present *Jivajivaabhigam* scripture is *Anangapravisht* *Bhagam*. From another perspective, the twelve parts are also called the twelve *Upang* of the twelve parts. Accordingly, *Pippapatik* etc. are given the name *Upang*. Acharya Malayagiri, who wrote a detailed commentary on *Jivajivaabhigam*, has called it the *Upang* of the third part - *Sthanang*. In the beginning of the present *Jivajivaabhigamasutra*, the venerable *Bhagavants* are presented as the formulators of this study - *Ih khalu Jinamyan Jinanuman Jinanuloma Jinappaniyam Jinaparuiyam Jinakkhayan Jinanuchinam Jinpannattam Jindeshiyam Jinapasattham Anuvviiy, Tam Saddhamana, Tam Pattiyamana, Tam Royamana Therabhagavanto Jivajivaabhigamanamajjayan Pannavinshu*. By contemplating this excellent *Jinamat*, which is approved by all *Jineshwars*, *Jinanuloma*, *Jinpranit*, *Jinpraroorit*, *Jinakhyant*, *Jinanuchirn*, *Jinprasapt* and *Jindeshi*, by having faith, belief and interest in it, the venerable *Bhagavants* formulated the study called *Jivajivaabhigam*. The above statement clarifies that the present sutra was composed by the venerable *Bhagavants*. Those venerable *Bhagavants* were the knowers of the right knowledge of the Tirthankaras' sermons. They had faith, belief and interest in their words. This implies that the *Agam* formulated by such venerable ones is also evidence, just as the *Agam* formulated by the omniscient, all-seeing Tirthankara Paramatma is evidence. Because the composition of the venerable ones is not contradictory to the words of the Tirthankaras. The explanation of the adjectives of *Jinamat* that have come in the present text has been done in the discussion of the original text. The name of the present sutra is *Jivajivaabhigam*, but mainly because of the presentation of the *Jiva* or in brief, this sutra is known as *Jivaabhigam*. 1. *Eyan Duwalasangam Ganipitagam Na Kayaavi Nasi, Na Kayaavi Na Bhavai, Na Kayaavin Bhabisasai, Ghunv Niccam Sasayam*  /  - *Nandi Sutra* [10]

Jain philosophy is primarily **ātmavādī** (soul-centric). The **jīva** (soul) is its central point. Although the **janasiddhanta** (general principles) has recognized nine **tattvas** (principles) or seven **tattvas** by including **puṇya** (merit), **pāpa** (demerit) in **pāśrava** (bond), **bandha** (attachment), all of them are just different states of the relationship or separation of **jīva** and **ajīva** (non-soul) **karma-dravya** (matter of action). The **ajīva** is presented to clearly explain the nature of the **jīva** and to differentiate it from its different nature. **Puṇya**, **pāpa**, **prādhava** (primordial), **sanvara** (purification), **nirjarā** (depletion), **bandha**, and **mokṣa** (liberation) are the states that arise from the combination and separation of **jīva** and **karma**. Therefore, it can be said that the core of Jain philosophy is **ātmadravya** (soul-substance). Its beginning is from **ātmavi-cāra** (reflection on the soul) and its final culmination is **mokṣa**. This **sūtra** (text) discusses the **ātmadravya**, i.e., the **jīva**, in detail. Therefore, it is called **jīvābhigama** (approach to the soul). **Abhigama** means knowledge. **Jīvābhigama** is the knowledge of **jīva** and **ajīva**. After generally mentioning the different aspects of **ajīva**, the entire purpose of this **sūtra** is to focus on **jīvatattva** (soul-principle). The **jīva** is divided into two categories: **siddh** (liberated) and **saṃsārasamāpannaka** (bound to the cycle of existence). Subsequently, the **sūtra** elaborates on nine **pratipattis** (perspectives) regarding the different **vivaksās** (interpretations) of **saṃsārasamāpannaka** souls. These nine **pratipattis** are presented from different perspectives, therefore, despite being different, they are not contradictory and are factual. This **jīva**, transformed by **rāgadveṣādi** (attachment, aversion, etc.) **vibhāvapariṇatis** (transformations of the subtle body), experiences different states, forms, births, deaths, etc. in the world, which are mentioned in these nine **pratipattis**. It is described in detail how the **jīvātma** (soul) experiences different states as **sthāvara** (immobile), as **strī-puruṣa** (female-male), **napumsaka** (neuter), as **nārak** (hell being), **tiryanc** (animal), **deva** (god), and **manuṣya** (human), as **ekendriya** (one-sensed) to **pañcendriya** (five-sensed), as **pṛthvīkāya** (earth body) to **traskāya** (subtle body), and in other forms from other perspectives. In the **dvividha** (two-fold) **pratipatti**, after explaining the different categories of **jīvas** as **sthāvara**, it describes them through 23 **dvāras** (gates): 1. **śarīra** (body), 2. **avagāhanā** (perception), 3. **saṃhanana** (aggregation), 4. **saṃsthāna** (structure), 5. **kaṣāya** (passions), 6. **saṃjñā** (consciousness), 7. **leśyā** (subtle karmic tendencies), 8. **indriya** (sense organs), 9. **samudghāta** (awakening), 10. **saṃjñī-prasamjñī** (conscious-unconscious), 11. **veda** (knowledge), 12. **paryāpta-aparyāpta** (sufficient-insufficient), 13. **dṛṣṭi** (vision), 14. **darśana** (perception), 15. **jñāna** (knowledge), 16. **yoga** (concentration), 17. **upayoga** (application), 18. **āhāra** (food), 19. **upapāta** (consequence), 20. **sthiti** (state), 21. **samavahata-asamavahata** (flowing-not flowing), 22. **cyavana** (decay), and 23. **gati-prāgati** (motion-progress). Similarly, in the subsequent **pratipattis**, different **dvāras** are presented for different categories of **jīvas**. The **dvāras** of **sthiti**, **saṃcitṭhaṇā** (body state), **antara** (interval), and **alpabahutva** (less-more) are mentioned as much as possible everywhere. In the final **pratipatti**, instead of discussing the **vivaksās** of **siddh** and **saṃsārī** (worldly), it presents the categories of all **jīvas**. This **sūtra** describes **adholoka** (lower world), **tiryagloka** (animal world), and **ūrdhvaloka** (upper world) in the context of **nārak**, **tiryanc**, **manuṣya**, and **deva**. In the description of **tiryagloka**, it mentions **dvīpa-samudra** (islands-oceans), **karmabhūmi-akarmabhūmi** (land of action-land of inaction), and provides a detailed discussion of the geographical and cultural conditions there, which is significant from various perspectives. Thus, this **sūtra** and its subject matter provide detailed information about the **jīva**. Therefore, its name **jīvābhigama** is meaningful. This **abhigama** is an important part of Jain philosophy. The original source of this **sūtra** is a **granthan** (text) of 4750 (four thousand seven hundred fifty) **ślokas** (verses). **Ācārya Malayagiri** wrote a **vṛtti** (commentary) of 14,000 (fourteen thousand) **granthan** on it, revealing the essence of this profound **abhigama**. The **vṛttikāra** (

The present edition of *Sampavana* is primarily based on the original text of *Jivaabhigasutra* published by Seth Shri Devchand Lalbhai Pustakodhar Fund, along with its commentary. However, there are differences between the original text published in that edition and the text accepted by the commentator in many places. This difference found in many places suggests that the commentator may have had another copy (ideal) in front of him. Therefore, in many places, we have given the commentator-approved text more acceptance in the original text. Such textual variations have been mentioned in footnotes (notes) from place to place. The commentator himself has mentioned that there are variations in the sutra texts of this *Pragama* in many places. It is worth remembering that this difference is about words, there is no difference in meaning. The difference is not in the theoretical aspect, but in the descriptive places, the difference in words and their order is visible. In such places, we have placed the commentator-approved text in the original. The commentary of Acharya Shri Malayagiri is also the main basis in the translation and discussion of the present *Pragama*. We have tried our best to present the theoretical subject matter of this theoretical *Pragama* in a clear manner before the inquisitive. Therefore, we have given almost all the main points clarified in the commentary in the discussion, so that inquisitive people who do not understand Sanskrit language can also benefit from them. I believe that through this effort of mine, Hindi-speaking inquisitive people will be able to understand all the theoretical things that have been explained in the commentary in Sanskrit language. From this point of view, the usefulness of this edition increases a lot. If the inquisitive people will benefit from it, then I will consider my effort meaningful. Finally, I consider myself blessed that I got the opportunity to prepare the present *Agama*. I was entrusted with the responsibility of editing the present *Jivaabhigasutra* on behalf of the *Pragama Prakashan Samiti*, Byawar. Considering the seriousness of the *sutra*, I definitely felt hesitant about my ability. But inspired by *Shruta Bhakti*, I accepted this responsibility and got involved in its execution with dedication. Whatever I could do, it is presented before the readers in this form. In my effort of *Shruta Seva*, I have received guidance from the revered Guru Shri Pushkar Muniji M., the Upadhyayashri of the *Shraman Sangh*, the renowned literary Guru Shri Devendramuniji M., and the cooperation of Pandit Shri Rameshmuniji M., Shri Surendramuniji, the learned Mahasati Dr. Shri Divyaprabhaji, Shri Anupamaji B.A. etc., as a result of which I have been able to successfully complete this arduous task. While editing the *Pragama*, I received the cooperation of Pandit Shri Vasanti Lalji Nalvaya, Ratlam, which I cannot forget. If my effort will benefit the inquisitive *Pragama* lovers, then I will consider my effort meaningful. Finally, I wish that faith, belief and interest in the principles formulated by Jinendra Dev will arise in the minds of every person, so that they can become pilgrims of the path of liberation by worshipping the three jewels of knowledge, vision and character.

The description of the Salt Ocean in the third section of the text is as follows: 154. The island named Jambudvipa is surrounded by the Salt Ocean, which is completely enclosed by a circular wall.  

O Venerable! Is the Salt Ocean circular or non-circular? 

It is circular, O Venerable!

O Venerable! What is the diameter of the Salt Ocean and what is its circumference?

O Venerable! The Salt Ocean has a diameter of two hundred thousand yojanas and a circumference of fifteen hundred thousand yojanas, eighty-two thousand yojanas, one hundred yojanas, and four yojanas, plus a little more.  

It is surrounded on all sides by a single mountain range called the Pumvaraveya, which is covered with a forest of sandalwood trees. The Pumvaraveya mountain is half a yojana high, five hundred dhanus wide, and has a circumference equal to that of the Salt Ocean. The rest is the same. 

The sandalwood forest extends for two yojanas and then ends. 

O Venerable! How many gates does the Salt Ocean have?

O Venerable! It has four gates: Vijaya, Vejayante, Jayante, and Aparajita.

O Venerable! Where is the gate named Vijaya located in the Salt Ocean?

O Venerable! The gate named Vijaya is located in the Salt Ocean at the eastern end of the Dhayi-khanda, at the eastern end of the southern part of the Dhayi-khanda, at the western end of the Maha-nadi, and at the beginning of the Salt Ocean. It is eight yojanas high and four yojanas wide. The rest is the same as the Vijaya gate of Jambudvipa, which is located at the eastern end of the Rayahani.

O Venerable! Where is the gate named Vejayante located in the Salt Ocean?

O Venerable! The gate named Vejayante is located in the Salt Ocean at the southern end of the Dhayi-khanda, at the southern end of the northern part of the Dhayi-khanda. The rest is the same.

The same applies to the Jayante gate, which is located at the beginning of the Navari-siya Maha-nadi.

The same applies to the Aparajita gate, which is located at the beginning of the Gavara-disibhaga.

O Venerable! What is the distance between the gates of the Salt Ocean?

O Venerable! The distance between the gates is three hundred thousand yojanas, five hundred yojanas, and two hundred yojanas, eighty yojanas. The distance between the gates of the Salt Ocean is two hundred thousand yojanas. // 1 //

The distance between the gates of the Salt Ocean is two hundred thousand yojanas. 1. The same applies to the Vijaya gate. 2. Some manuscripts contain a complete description of all four gates in the original text, but this has already been mentioned and is not consistent with the commentary, so it has not been included here.

## The Third Rebirth: The Description of the Salt Ocean

One should know that the **Salt Ocean** is located above the **Shiita Mahanadi**. Similarly, one should know about **Aparajitadwar**. Its characteristic is that it is located at the northern end of the **Salt Ocean**, and its southern part is in the **Dhataki Khand**. Its capital is in another **Salt Ocean**, after crossing countless islands in the sea, north of **Aparajitadwar**. Oh Bhagwan! What is the distance between these doors of the **Salt Ocean**? Gautam! The distance between each door is **395,280 yojanas and one kos**. Oh Bhagwan! Are the regions of the **Dhataki Khand** touching the **Salt Ocean**? Yes, Gautam! They are touching, and all the descriptions should be the same as those given for **Jambu Dweep**. The regions of the **Dhataki Khand** are in contact with the **Salt Ocean**, and all the statements should be known as before. Do beings born in the **Salt Ocean** die and are reborn in the **Dhataki Khand**? All the statements should be known as before. The same should be said about beings born in the **Dhataki Khand** dying and being reborn in the **Salt Ocean**. Oh Bhagwan! Why is the **Salt Ocean** called the **Salt Ocean**? Gautam! The water of the **Salt Ocean** is impure, muddy, salty, **lindr** (having a taste like cow dung), brackish, bitter, and undrinkable for bipeds, quadrupeds, deer, animals, birds, and reptiles. It is only drinkable for creatures born in the **Salt Ocean** (because they are born there, they consume it). The ruler of the **Salt Ocean** is a god named **Susthit**, who is very powerful and has the status of **Palyopam**. He rules over his own family, including his **Samanik** gods, the capital of **Susthita** in the **Salt Ocean**, and many other gods and goddesses who reside there. Therefore, Gautam, the **Salt Ocean** is called the **Salt Ocean**. Another point, Gautam, is that the name "**Salt Ocean**" is eternal and permanent. (Therefore, this name is **animittik**.) - 155. In the **Salt Ocean**, Bhagwan! How many moons were shining, are shining, and will shine? This question should be understood to include all five celestial bodies, including the moon. Gautam! In the **Salt Ocean**, four moons were shining, are shining, and will shine. Four suns were shining, are shining, and will shine. One hundred and twelve constellations were making conjunctions with the moon, are making conjunctions, and will make conjunctions. 1. The width of each door is four yojanas. Each door has two branches, each one kos thick. The total width of one door is four and a half yojanas. The total width of all four doors is 18 yojanas. The circumference of the **Salt Ocean** is 18 yojanas less, and dividing it by four gives the above measure.

"There were, are, and will be three hundred and fifty-two Mahagrahas (great planets) moving. Two hundred sixty-seven thousand nine hundred Koḍakoḍī (trillions) stars were, are, and will be shining.

The reason for the increase in water: 156. "Kamma ṇam bhanta! Does the salt ocean increase or decrease during the fourteen-day full moon?" "Go-yama! Outside the Jambudvipa island, in the four directions, the salt ocean is spread for twenty-five thousand yojanas. There are four great Mahapaatala (great underground regions) established, namely: Valayamukhe, Ketue, Juve, Isare. These great Mahapaatala are one hundred thousand yojanas in height, ten thousand yojanas in diameter at the base, one hundred thousand yojanas in diameter in the middle, and ten thousand yojanas in diameter at the mouth. These great Mahapaatala have a circumference of ten hundred thousand yojanas, all made of white, fine sand. There are many living beings who are born, grow, decay, and die. These sands are destroyed by the wind and rain. There are four gods who reside there, namely: Kale, Maha-kale, Velambe, Pabhanjane. These great Mahapaatala are divided into three parts, namely: the lower part, the middle part, and the upper part. These three parts are thirty-three thousand yojanas in length, thirty-three hundred yojanas in width, and one yojana in height. In the lower part, there are only winds. In the middle part, there are both winds and clouds. In the upper part, there are only clouds.

Furthermore, Go-yama! In the salt ocean, there are many small underground regions called Khuddapataala (small underground regions). These small Mahapaatala are one thousand yojanas in height, one hundred yojanas in diameter at the base, one thousand yojanas in diameter in the middle, and one hundred yojanas in diameter at the mouth. These small Mahapaatala have a circumference of ten yojanas, all made of white, fine sand. There are many living beings who are born, grow, decay, and die. These sands are destroyed by the wind and rain.

There are four moons and four suns in the salt ocean. There are twelve constellations and three hundred and fifty-two planets.

There are two hundred thousand, sixty-six thousand, and nine hundred Koḍakoḍī (trillions) stars in the salt ocean."

## Third Section: The Cause of Water Increase

They say that these great oceans are divided into three parts, namely, the lower part, the middle part, and the upper part. These three parts are each thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three yojanas and one-third yojana (333333) in thickness.

In the lower part, there is only air. In the middle part, there is both air and water. In the upper part, there is only water.

Similarly, in the salt ocean, there are seven thousand eight hundred and eighty-four yojanas of water surrounding the earth.

Now, in the lower and middle parts of these great oceans and small oceans, many winds arise, they gather, they rise, they move, they shake, they roar, they thunder, they roar, they change their state. Due to this, the water level rises.

But when in the lower and middle parts of these great oceans and small oceans, many winds do not arise, and they do not change their state, then the water level does not rise.

Similarly, if the winds rise, the water level rises. If the winds do not rise, the water level does not rise.

Thus, O Gautama! In the salt ocean, the water level increases and decreases on the fourteenth, eighth, new moon, and full moon days.

## Explanation of the Cause

O Bhagavan! What is the reason for the water level of the salt ocean increasing and decreasing on the fourteenth, eighth, new moon, and full moon days?

O Gautama! In the four directions of the Jambudvipa island, beyond the outer Vedicant, at a distance of ninety-five thousand yojanas in the salt ocean, there are four very large Mahapatala Kalashas, shaped like a great pitcher. Their names are Valayamukha, Keyupa, Yupa, and Ishvara.

These Patala Kalashas are one hundred thousand yojanas deep in the water. Their diameter at the base is ten thousand yojanas. From there, they gradually widen, reaching a width of one hundred thousand yojanas in the middle. Then, they gradually narrow again, reaching a width of ten thousand yojanas at the mouth.

The walls of these Patala Kalashas are uniform throughout. They are all one thousand yojanas thick. They are entirely made of vajra-ratna (diamond), as clear as the sky and crystal, and are perfectly symmetrical.

Within these walls, many living beings are born and die. Many pudgalas (matter particles) gather and disperse. There is a constant cycle of creation and destruction of pudgalas.

These walls are eternal according to the Dravyarthik Nay (principle of substance), and they are imperishable according to the Paryaya Nay (principle of modification).

In these Patala Kalashas, there reside four great Dikpala Devas (guardian deities) who are in the state of Palyopama (supreme bliss). Their names are Kal, Mahakal, Velamb, and Prabhanjan.

These Mahapatala Kalashas are divided into three parts: 1. The lower part, 2. The middle part, and 3. The upper part. Each of these parts is thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three yojanas and one-third yojana (333333) thick.

In the lower part, there is only air. In the middle part, there is both air and water. In the upper part, there is only water.

The water level of the salt ocean increases and decreases due to the winds arising in the lower and middle parts of these Mahapatala Kalashas. When the winds arise, they push the water upwards, causing the water level to rise. When the winds do not arise, the water level remains stable.

This is the reason why the water level of the salt ocean increases and decreases on the fourteenth, eighth, new moon, and full moon days. 

Page #519:
---------------------------
The **Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra** states that the **Vayu-Kaya** and **Ap-Kaya** are present in the lower and middle sections of the **Maha-Patala-Kalasha**, while only **Ap-Kaya** is present in the upper section. Additionally, O Gautam! within the **Lavana-Samudra** (salt ocean), amidst these **Maha-Patala-Kalasha**, there are numerous smaller **Patala-Kalasha** resembling small pots. These smaller **Patala-Kalasha** are each a thousand **Yojan** deep, a hundred **Yojan** wide at their base, and expand to a thousand **Yojan** wide at their middle, increasing in size by one **Pradesh** at a time. They then decrease in size by one **Pradesh** at a time, reaching a hundred **Yojan** wide at their mouth.

The walls of these smaller **Patala-Kalasha** are uniform, ten **Yojan** thick, entirely made of **Vajra** (diamond), and are pure and transparent. Many **Jivas** (living beings) are born and emerge within them, and many **Pudgala** (matter particles) accumulate and disperse, undergoing constant **Chaya-Apachaya** (creation and destruction). These walls are eternal according to the **Dravya-Athi-Nay** (theory of substance), but impermanent according to the **Varna-Adi-Paryaya** (theory of categories).

Each of these smaller **Patala-Kalasha** is inhabited by **Devas** (divine beings) in the state of **Ardha-Palyopam** (half-lotus). These smaller **Patala-Kalasha** are divided into three sections: 1. Lower Tri-Bhag, 2. Middle Tri-Bhag, and 3. Upper Tri-Bhag. These three sections are each three hundred thirty-three **Yojan** and one-third **Yojan** (3333) thick. The **Vayu-Kaya** is present in the lower Tri-Bhag, both **Vayu-Kaya** and **Ap-Kaya** are present in the middle Tri-Bhag, and only **Ap-Kaya** is present in the upper Tri-Bhag.

Thus, in total, there are seven thousand eight hundred eighty-four (7884) **Patala-Kalasha** in the **Lavana-Samudra**, including both the **Maha-Patala** and **Kshudra-Patala** (large and small **Patala-Kalasha**).

In the lower and middle sections of these **Maha-Patala** and **Kshudra-Patala** **Kalasha**, many **Vayu-Kaya** with **Urdhva-Gaman** (ascending) nature or strong power are born. They attain **Pratma-Labh** (liberation) through **Samurchana-Janma** (birth from a state of complete immersion), tremble, tremble intensely, move forcefully, rub against each other, and spread out powerfully in all directions. As they transform into different states, the ocean water is agitated and thrown upwards by them.

When these **Vayu-Kaya** with strong power are not born in the lower and middle sections of the **Maha-Patala** and **Kshudra-Patala** **Kalasha**, or when they do not transform into those states, the water does not rise. Twice a day (at regular intervals) and on the fourteenth and other lunar days (due to the nature of the universe), the water of the **Lavana-Samudra** is agitated and rises particularly high due to these **Vayu-Kaya**. It does not rise at other times, except at regular intervals.

Therefore, O Gautam! the water of the **Lavana-Samudra** rises on the fourteenth, eighth, and new moon days (as stated in the **Sangrahni-Gatha**).

## Third Chapter: The Statement of the Salt Crest

**157.**  "O Bhagavan! How many times does the salt ocean rise and fall in thirty muhurtas (a day and night)?"

"O Gautama! The salt ocean rises and falls twice in thirty muhurtas (a day and night)."

"O Bhagavan! Why is it said that the salt ocean rises and falls twice in thirty muhurtas?"

"O Gautama! When the air is agitated, the water rises from the lower and middle compartments of the Patala Kalasas (underground reservoirs) and the ocean rises. When the air is still, the Patala Kalasas are filled with water and the ocean falls. Therefore, O Gautama! It is said that the salt ocean rises and falls twice in thirty muhurtas."

**158.** "O Bhagavan! How wide is the salt crest in relation to the circumference of the Chakravala (the universe) and how much does it rise and fall?"

"O Gautama! The salt crest rises and falls by half a yojana (a measure of distance) in relation to the circumference of the Chakravala, which is ten thousand yojanas."

"O Bhagavan! How many Gagasahasras (a measure of depth) does the salt ocean hold in its inner circumference? How many Nagasahasras does it hold in its outer circumference? How many Nagasahasras does it hold in its sunrise circumference?"

"O Gautama! The salt ocean holds forty-two Gagasahasras in its inner circumference, forty-two Gagasahasras in its outer circumference, and sixty Nagasahasras in its sunrise circumference. Thus, with its coverings, it is one Nagasahasra and one Gagasahasra." 

Page #521:
---------------------------
[10] Gautama! The crest of the salt ocean is ten thousand yojanas wide, compared to the circumference of the chakravala, and it rises and falls by a little less than half a yojana. O Bhagavan! How many thousand Naga Kumar Devas hold the inner rim of the salt ocean? How many thousand Naga Kumar Devas hold the outer rim? How many thousand Naga Kumar Devas hold the agrodaka? Gautama! Forty-two thousand Naga Kumar Devas hold the inner rim of the salt ocean / Seventy-two thousand Naga Kumar Devas hold the outer rim / Sixty thousand Naga Kumar Devas hold the agrodaka / Thus, the total number of these Naga Kumaras is said to be one hundred and seventy-four thousand. Discussion - The crest of the salt ocean is equal in all directions to the circumference of the chakravala and is ten thousand yojanas in circumference. That crest rises and falls by a little less than half a yojana (two kosas). This is clear as follows: In the salt ocean, there is a gotirtha from Jambudvipa and from Dhaatki-khandadvipa up to ninety-five thousand yojanas. Gotirtha means the land that gradually slopes downwards, entering into ponds, etc. / The middle part is ten thousand yojanas deep. Near the vedika of Jambudvipa and near the vedika of Dhaatki-khandadvipa, the gotirtha is an immeasurable part of an angula. From there onwards, one should understand that the land gradually slopes downwards from the flat land, until a distance of ninety-five thousand yojanas is reached / There is a depth of one thousand yojanas up to a distance of ninety-five thousand yojanas, compared to the flat land / Therefore, near the Jambudvipa vedika and the Dhaatki-khandadvipa vedika, there is an increase in water in that flat land, which is an immeasurable part of an angula. From there onwards, one should understand that the increase in water gradually increases with the increase in land, until a distance of ninety-five thousand yojanas is reached on both sides. Here, there is an increase in water of seven hundred yojanas compared to the flat land / That is, there is a depth of one thousand yojanas from the flat land and an increase in water of seven hundred yojanas above it. From there onwards, in the middle part, there is a depth of one thousand yojanas in a width of ten thousand yojanas and an increase in water of sixteen thousand yojanas. When the air in the Patala-kalasha is disturbed, there is an increase in water above it by a little less than two kosas in a day and night, twice. When the air in the Patala-kalasha is calm, there is no increase in water / This is what is said in these verses: Pancaanauyasahaasse gotittan ubhayano vi lavanassa / Joyanasayaani satta udaga parivuddhivi ubhayo vi // 1 // Dasajoyanasahasssa lavanasiha cakkavalao ruda / Solasasahassa uccaa sahassemegam ca progaadhaa // 2 // Desuunamaddhajoyana lavanasihovari durga duve kaalo. Prairegam airegam parivai haaye va vi // 3 //

## Third Incarnation: The Statement of the Salt Flame

[11] There are forty-two thousand Naga Kumar Devas who belong to the Bhavanapati Nikaya, who prevent the inner edge of the Salt Ocean, that is, the peak that rises towards Jambudvipa, and the water that rises on it from going beyond the boundary. Similarly, there are seventy-two thousand Naga Kumar Devas who prevent the outer edge of the Salt Ocean, that is, the peak that rises towards the Dhataki Khand, and the excess growth on it from going beyond the boundary. There are sixty thousand Naga Kumar Devas who prevent the Anodak of the Salt Ocean (the water that rises above the Deson Ardhayojan). These Naga Kumar Devas keep the edge of the Salt Ocean within its limits. The total number of these Velandhara Naga Kumaras is one lakh seventy-four thousand.

There are four Anuve-landhar Nagarajas, their names are - Karkotaka, Kardama, Kailasa, and Arunaprabha.  /  O Bhagavan! How many Avasa-parvata (residences) do these four Anuve-landhar Nagarajas have?  /  Gautam! There are four Avasa-parvata, namely - Karkotaka, Kardama, Kailasa, and Arunaprabha.  /  O Bhagavan! Where is the Avasa-parvata named Karkotaka, belonging to the Anuve-landhar Nagaraja Karkotaka?  /  Gautam! In the Jambudvipa, 42,000 yojanas ahead in the Lavanasamudra, in the northeast direction of the Meru Parvata (Mount Meru), is the Avasa-parvata named Karkotaka, belonging to the Nagaraja Karkotaka, which is 1721 yojanas high. The same description should be applied to the Go-stupa Parvata.  /  The special feature is that it is entirely made of jewels, it is pure, and all the details, including the throne and its surroundings, should be described as before.  /  The reason for naming it Karkotaka is that the lotuses and other flowers in the wells and other places here are of the same shape and color as the Karkotaka.  /  The rest should be described as before.  /  The capital city of Karkotaka is located in the Lavanasamudra, beyond countless islands and seas, in the northeast direction of the Karkotaka Parvata. The measure and other details are the same as before.

[1]  "The complete description of the Avasa-parvata named Kardama is the same as before. The special feature is that it is located in the Lavanasamudra, 42,000 yojanas ahead in the southeast direction of the Meru Parvata.  /  Its capital city is Vidyu-tprabha, which is located in the Lavanasamudra, beyond countless islands and seas, in the southeast direction of this Avasa-parvata. The description should be understood as the same as the capital city of Vijaya.  /  The complete description of the Avasa-parvata named Kailasa is the same as before. The special feature is that it is located in the southwest direction of the Meru Parvata.  /  Its capital city is Kailasa, which is located in the Lavanasamudra, beyond countless islands and seas, in the southwest direction of the Kailasa Parvata.  /  The Avasa-parvata named Arunaprabha is located in the northwest direction of the Meru Parvata.  /  Its capital city is also located in the Lavanasamudra, beyond countless islands and seas, in the northwest direction of the Arunaprabha Avasa-parvata. The rest of the description is the same as the capital city of Vijaya.  /  All four Avasa-parvata are of equal measure and are entirely made of jewels.

[1]  "The deity of the Kardama Avasa-parvata is naturally Yaksha-kardamapriya. Yaksha-kardama means a fragrant substance made by mixing saffron, agarwood, camphor, musk, sandalwood, etc.  /  The first part of the word is omitted, hence it is called Kardama."

On top of this jewel platform, there is a divine bed. Its description should be known as before.

O Bhagavan! Why is Gautamdvipa called Gautamdvipa? Gautam! In Gautamdvipa, there are many lotuses and lilies, which have the shape and radiance of a Gautama (Gomaedaratna) jewel. Therefore, it is called Gautamdvipa. This Gautamdvipa is eternal in terms of its substance. Therefore, its name is also eternal and without any cause.

O Bhagavan! Where is the capital city of Susthita Deva, the Lord of Salt, called Susthita? Gautam! In the west of Gautamdvipa, after crossing countless islands and seas diagonally, there is the capital city Susthita in another salt sea. It is found twelve thousand yojanas further in the other salt sea. All the details should be known like the description of the capital city of Gostupa, until the great Deva Susthita is found there.

Tell me, Venerable One! What is the name of the Moon Island among the Moon Islands in Jambudvipa? Gotama! In Jambudvipa, twelve thousand yojanas east of the Mandara Mountain, in the salt sea, there is the Moon Island, called Chandadvipa. It is forty-nine and a half yojanas wide from the edge of Jambudvipa, and the water is five and a half yojanas deep. The water is two kosas deep in the salt sea. It is twelve thousand yojanas in length and breadth, and its description is like that of Gotamadvipa.

The leaves of the Paumavaraveiya trees are covered with forests, and they are of two colors. There are many beautiful lands, until the gods reside there. In the middle of these beautiful lands, there are jewel platforms, two yojanas wide, and the thrones with their families should be described in the same way.

Gotama! In many small and large caves, there are many lotuses, which have the color of the moon. The gods reside there, until the second transformation of the Paliyovam.

18] [Jivajiva-migam-sutra] In this, many Jyotishka Devas and Devis are said to reside.  How far does this extend?  Gotama!  It extends as far as the Chandradvipas.  How far are the Chandradvipas from Jambudvipa?  Gotama!  From the eastern side of Jambudvipa, going straight across, twelve thousand yojanas away, are the two Chandradvipas.  Their size is the same as the Chandras, the great Devas.  How far is the Suradipa from Jambudvipa?  Gotama!  From the eastern side of the Mandara mountain, twelve thousand yojanas away, is the Suradipa.  Its height, length, and breadth are to be known as the same as the Vanasando, the landmass, and the Asaya.  Its size is the same as the Mani-pedhika, the throne, and the family of the eight Ushpalas, the Sura-Prabhais, the Suras, the Devas, and the Chandradvipas.  From the western side of the Suradipa, twelve thousand yojanas away, is the Suradipa.  This is the extent of the Sura Devas.  162.  O Bhagavan!  Where are the two Chandradvipas of the two Chandramas of Jambudvipa?  Gotama!  From the eastern side of the Meru mountain, twelve thousand yojanas away, are the two Chandradvipas of the two Chandramas of Jambudvipa.  These islands are 88 1/2 yojanas high above Jambudvipa and two yojanas high above the salt ocean.  They are twelve thousand yojanas long and wide.  The rest of the circumference, etc., should be known as the same as the Gautamadipa.  They are surrounded by lotus-like platforms and forests.  Both should be described.  In those islands, there are many beautiful landmasses where many Jyotishka Devas rise and sit.  In those beautiful landmasses, there are palaces, which are 62 1/2 yojanas high.  The rest of the description should be known as the same as the Gautamadipa.  In the middle, there are Mani-pedhikas, which are two yojanas long and wide and one yojana thick.  The rest, including the throne and family, should be described as before.  O Bhagavan!  Why are these called Chandradvipas?  Gotama!  In those islands, there are many small ponds, etc., with many lotuses, etc., which are like the moon in nature and radiance.  There, the great Devas called Chandra, who are in the state of Palyopama, reside.  They rule over four thousand Samanika Devas, the Chandradvipas, the Chandra capitals, and many other Jyotishka Devas and Devis, experiencing the results of their virtuous deeds.  Therefore, Gotama, they are called Chandradvipas.  Gotama!  These Chandradvipas are eternal in terms of substance, and therefore their names are also eternal.  O Bhagavan!  Where are the Chandra capitals of the Chandras of Jambudvipa?  Gotama!  From the eastern side of the Chandradvipas, going straight across, countless islands and oceans, twelve thousand yojanas away, are these capitals.

O Bhagavan! Why are the Surya-dvipas called Surya-dvipas?  Gautama!  In the wells, etc., of those islands, there are many lotuses, etc., like the sun in color and shape, therefore they are called Surya-dvipas.  These Surya-dvipas are eternal in terms of substance.  Therefore, their name is also eternal.  In them, Surya Deva, Samanik Deva, etc., all the luminous gods and goddesses reside and roam, their capitals are located twelve thousand yojanas ahead in another Jambudvipa, after crossing countless islands and seas west of their respective islands.

"Gautama! From the eastern Vedikant of Devadvipa, twelve thousand yojanas westward in the Devodasamudra, there are the Chandradvipas of the Chandras of Devadvipa.  Similarly, proceeding westward from the Chandradvipas towards the Rajadhani, there are countless thousands of yojanas to the Chandras of Devadvipa.  The Rajadhani of the Chandras of Devadvipa is called Chandras.  The rest should be described as in the case of the Rajadhani of Vijaya."

"O Bhagavan! Where are the Suryadvipas, the islands of the Suryas, located in Devadvipa?"

"Gautama! From the western Vedikant of Devadvipa, twelve thousand yojanas eastward in the Devodasamudra, there are the Suryadvipas of the Suryas of Devadvipa.  Similarly, proceeding eastward from the Suryadvipas towards the Rajadhani, there are countless thousands of yojanas to the Suryas of Devadvipa.  The Rajadhani of the Suryas of Devadvipa is called Suryas."

"O Bhagavan! Where are the Chandradvipas, the islands of the Chandras, located in Devasamudra?"

"Gautama! From the eastern Vedikant of the Devodakasamudra, twelve thousand yojanas westward in the Devodakasamudra, there are the Chandradvipas of the Chandras of Devasamudra.  Similarly, proceeding westward from the Chandradvipas towards the Rajadhani, there are countless thousands of yojanas to the Chandras of Devasamudra.  The Rajadhani of the Chandras of Devasamudra is called Chandras.  The rest should be described as in the case of the Rajadhani of Vijaya."

24] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra] The Jivajivaabhigamsutra islands are located in the Devodakasamudra, west of the Dvopon islands, after traveling an immeasurable number of thousands of yojanas. The remaining description should be similar to that of the Vijaya capital. The same should be said about the suns in the Devasamudra. The special feature is that they are located twelve thousand yojanas east of the western Vedicant of the Devodakasamudra, in the Devodakasamudra. Their capitals are located an immeasurable number of thousands of yojanas ahead in the Devodakasamudra, east of their respective islands.  /  Similarly, the same should be said about the islands of the moon and sun of the four islands and four seas of the Nagas, Yakshas, Bhutas, and Swayambhuraman.

[25] Going further, the Sun-islands (Surya-dvipa) are encountered. Their capitals are located in the east of their respective islands, in the self-created ocean of Raman, after traversing countless thousands of yojanas.  [168] "Are there Velandhara Nagarajas, Agghas, Khannas, Sihas, Vijati, and aquatic creatures like fish and turtles in the Salt Ocean (Lavana-samudra), Bhagavan? Is there an increase and decrease in the water?" "Yes, Gautama! Just as there are Velandhara Nagarajas, Agghas, Khannas, Sihas, and Vijati, these aquatic creatures like fish and turtles in the Salt Ocean, are there also these in the oceans outside the two and a half islands?" "No, Gautama, they are not there." [169] "Bhagavan, is the Salt Ocean salty, rocky, turbulent, or calm?" "Gautama, the Salt Ocean is salty, not rocky, turbulent, not calm." "Are the oceans outside the two and a half islands salty, rocky, turbulent, or calm?" "Gautama, the oceans outside the two and a half islands are not salty, not rocky, not turbulent, not calm, but they are full, completely filled, and remain stable with equal density." "Bhagavan, are there many whirlpools and currents in the Salt Ocean that pull things in, push things out, or cause things to sink?" "Yes, Gautama! Just as there are many whirlpools and currents in the Salt Ocean that pull things in, push things out, or cause things to sink, are there also these in the oceans outside the two and a half islands?" "No, Gautama, they are not there."

[1] The author of the Mula-tika also says, "Thus, the islands of the Moon and Sun in the remaining islands are to be found in the immediate oceans. Their capitals are located in the east and west, after traversing countless islands and oceans, and then in the second island with a similar name. After leaving the last five islands, they are located in the self-created oceans of the Devas, Nagas, Yakshas, and Bhutas. The capitals of the Moon and Sun are not in another island, but in their own, after traversing countless thousands of yojanas from the edge of the Vedika, in the east and west." There are many variations in the text of these sutras, but the meaning is the same everywhere. This is according to the explanation, and all should follow it, not be confused. [2] The author of the Churnika says, "Agghas, Khannas, Sihas, and Vijati are aquatic creatures like fish and turtles."

From the Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra, what is said, Venerable One? It is said: Are the external oceans full, completely full, overflowing, especially overflowing, like a pot filled to the brim? Gautama! The external oceans are not overflowing, they are full, they are not overflowing, they are full. Venerable One! Just as the salt ocean is overflowing, not full, overflowing, not full, are the external oceans also overflowing, not full, overflowing, not full? Gautama! The external oceans are not overflowing, they are full, they are not overflowing, they are full. They are full, completely full, overflowing, especially overflowing, like a pot filled to the brim. Venerable One! Are there many large clouds in the salt ocean that are born, arise, or rain? Yes, Gautama! There are clouds there and they rain. Venerable One! Just as there are many large clouds in the salt ocean that are born and rain, are there also many clouds in the external oceans that are born and rain? Gautama! That is not so. Venerable One! Why is it said that the external oceans are full, completely full, overflowing, especially overflowing, and like a pot filled to the brim? Gautama! In the external oceans, many water-born beings come and go, and many pudgalas gather as water, especially gather, therefore it is said that the external oceans are full, completely full, overflowing, like a pot filled to the brim. 170. Venerable One! What is the extent of the upward-spreading of the salt ocean? Gautama! The salt ocean is said to have an upward-spreading extent of five hundred and five hundred yojanas on both sides. Five hundred and five hundred yojanas is said to be the extent of the upward-spreading of the yojana.

## Third Chapter: Special Features of Devadvipa etc. [27]

**Question:**  O Bhagavan! How does the depth of the salt ocean increase? In other words, how much does the depth increase for every distance travelled?

**Answer:**  O Gautama! The depth of the salt ocean increases by one *prastha* (a unit of measurement) for every 95 *prasthas* travelled from both sides (from the edge of Jambudvipa and from the edge of the salt ocean). Similarly, the depth increases by one *balagra* (hair tip) for every 95 *balagras* travelled, by one *likkha* (a unit of measurement) for every 95 *likkhas*, by one *yavamdhya* (middle of a barley grain) for every 95 *yavamdhyas*, and so on. The same applies for *angula* (finger), *vitasti* (span), *rasni* (hand), *kukshi* (belly), *dhanush* (bow), *kośa* (a unit of measurement), *yojana* (a unit of measurement), *hundred yojanas*, and *thousand yojanas*.

**Question:**  O Bhagavan! How does the height of the salt ocean increase? In other words, how much does the height increase for every distance travelled?

**Answer:**  O Gautama! The height of the salt ocean increases by sixteen *prasthas* for every 95 *prasthas* travelled from both sides.

**Answer:**  O Gautama! This pattern continues, so for every 95 *thousand yojanas* travelled, the height increases by sixteen *thousand yojanas*.

**Explanation:**  The depth of the salt ocean increases by one *prastha* for every 95 *prasthas* travelled from both the edge of Jambudvipa and the edge of the salt ocean. Similarly, the depth increases by one *balagra* for every 95 *balagras* travelled. The same applies for *likkha*, *yavamdhya*, *angula*, *vitasti*, *rasni*, *kukshi*, *dhanush*, *kośa*, *yojana*, *hundred yojanas*, and *thousand yojanas*. This means that for every 95 *thousand yojanas* travelled, the depth increases by one *thousand yojanas*.

Now, if the height increases by one *thousand yojanas* for every 95 *thousand yojanas* travelled, then according to the rule of three, the height increase for 95 *yojanas* can be calculated as follows:

* Set up the three quantities: 95000 / 1000 / 95
* Remove the three zeros from the first two quantities (according to the rule "zero divided by zero is zero"): 95 / 1 / 95
* Multiply the middle quantity (1) by the last quantity (95): 1 x 95 = 95
* Divide the result (95) by the first quantity (95): 95 / 95 = 1

This means that the height increases by one *yojana* for every 95 *yojanas* travelled. This is what is stated in these verses.

[28] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra Panchaanauae Sahassee Gantun Joayanaani Ubhashro Vi. Joayana Sahasssamegam Lavane Progahao Hoi // 1 // Panchaanauiin Lavane Gantun Joayanaani Ubhaao Vi / Joayanamegam Lavane Progaahenam Munenva // 2 // 

The meaning is that if there is an increase of one yojana in depth after traveling 95 yojanas, then it is easily understood that there is an increase of one gavyuta after traveling 95 gavyutas, and an increase of one dhanush after traveling 95 dhanush. This is said with respect to depth. Before this, a question was asked about the increase in height of the salt sea and an answer was given. The question was asked: how much water increases after traveling a certain distance from both sides of the salt sea? The answer is: the increase in water on the flat ground on both sides of the salt sea is an immeasurable part of an angul, and further, the increase in water increases gradually with the increase in the area, reaching an increase of seven hundred yojanas after traveling 95 thousand yojanas. Beyond that, in an area of ten thousand yojanas, there is an increase of sixteen thousand yojanas. The meaning is that an increase in elevation of 16 pradeshas is said to occur after traveling 95 pradeshas (sarenu) from both sides of the salt sea. An increase in elevation of 16 balagra occurs after traveling 95 balagra. Similarly, an increase in elevation of 16 thousand yojanas occurs after traveling 95 thousand yojanas. Here, the concept of the rule of three is that if there is an increase in elevation of sixteen (16) thousand yojanas after traveling 95 thousand yojanas, then how much will the increase in elevation be after traveling 95 yojanas? Setting up the three quantities 95000/16000/95, after removing three zeros from both the first and middle quantities, the quantities become 95/16/95. Multiplying the middle quantity 16 by the third quantity 95, we get 1520. Dividing this by the first quantity 95, we get a quotient of 16. That is, there is an increase in water of 16 yojanas after traveling 95 yojanas. It is said: Panchaanauisahassee Gandan Joayanaani Ubhano Vi / Ussehehan Lavano Solas Sahisso Bhainio // 1 // Panchanauii Lavane Gantun Joayanaani Ubhaao Vi. Ussehehan Lavano Solas Kil Joayana Hoi // 2 // If there is an elevation of 16 yojanas after traveling 95 yojanas, then it is easily understood that there is an elevation of 16 gavyutas after traveling 95 gavyutas, and an elevation of 16 dhanush after traveling 95 dhanush.

## Third Chapter: Explanation of Gotith (Holy Place)

**171.**  O Bhagavan! How large is the Gotith portion of the Salt Ocean? (The progressively lower and deeper part is called Gotith.) O Gautama! The Salt Ocean has a Gotith of 95,000 yojanas on both sides. (It is progressively lower and deeper.) O Bhagavan! How large is the portion of the Salt Ocean that is said to be devoid of Gotith? O Gautama! The Salt Ocean has a region of 10,000 yojanas that is devoid of Gotith. (This means that this region of 10,000 yojanas is flat.) O Gautama! How large is the Udakmala (water garland, a water mass 16,000 yojanas high above the level water) of the Salt Ocean? O Gautama! The Udakmala is 10,000 yojanas. (The water mass remaining above the depthless portion is called Udakmala.)

**172.** O Bhagavan! What is the structure of the Salt Ocean? O Gautama! The Salt Ocean has the structure of a Gotith, the structure of a boat, the structure of a conch shell, the structure of a horse's shoulder, the structure of a Valabhi house, and the structure of a circular and ring-shaped structure. O Bhagavan! What is the circumference of the Salt Ocean? What is its perimeter? What is its height? What is its elevation? What is its total size? O Gautama! The Salt Ocean has a circumference of 200,000 yojanas, a perimeter of 150,000 yojanas plus 1,000 yojanas plus 1 yojana, slightly less than that, a height of 1,000 yojanas, an elevation of 16,000 yojanas, and a total size of 17,000 yojanas.

**172.** O Bhagavan! What is the structure of the Salt Ocean? O Gautama! The Salt Ocean has the structure of a Gotith, the structure of a boat, the structure of a conch shell, the structure of a horse's shoulder, the structure of a Valabhi house, and the structure of a circular and ring-shaped structure.

**Notes:**

1. Gotith is the progressively lower and deeper part of a water body.
2. "Panchaanauwi sahasse gotithe ubhayano vi lavanassa." This means that the Salt Ocean has a Gotith of 95,000 yojanas on both sides.
3. Udakmala is a water mass that is 16,000 yojanas high above the level water. It is the water mass remaining above the depthless portion of a water body.

##  30] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra, O Bhagavan! What is the diameter of the salt ocean (Lavanasamudra)? What is its circumference? What is its depth? What is its height? What is its total measure?  _ Gautama! The diameter of the salt ocean is two lakh yojanas. Its circumference is slightly less than fifteen lakh eighty-one thousand one hundred thirty-nine (1581139) yojanas. Its depth is one thousand yojanas. Its height (utsedha) is sixteen thousand yojanas.  /  The total measure, including both depth (udvedha) and height (utsedha), is seventeen thousand yojanas. Discussion - The shape of the salt ocean has been described in various ways, taking into account different perspectives.  /  It has been said to be shaped like a Gotirtha (a type of water vessel) due to the gradual increase in depth. It has been said to be shaped like a boat due to the gradual increase in water level on both sides, compared to the flat land. It has been said to be shaped like a soap bubble due to the combination of the water of the depth (udvedha) and the water of the increase in water level. It has been said to be shaped like a horse's hump due to the elevation of 95 thousand yojanas on both sides and the high peak of sixteen thousand yojanas. It has been said to be shaped like a Valabhi (a type of building) due to the peak of ten thousand yojanas in width, appearing like a Valabhi. The salt ocean is round and shaped like a bead. The diameter, circumference, depth, height, and total measure of the salt ocean are clear from the original meaning. ' 1. Here, the ancient teachers have also calculated the volume and surface area of the salt ocean, which is being provided here for those who are curious. The calculation of the surface area is as follows: From the two lakh yojanas of the salt ocean, ten thousand yojanas are subtracted, and half of the remaining amount is taken - this results in 95000. The previously subtracted ten thousand yojanas are added to this amount, resulting in 105000. This amount is called koti. This koti is multiplied by the middle circumference (paririya) of the salt ocean, which is 948683, to obtain the surface area. That surface area is - 99611715000  /  It is said: "Subtract ten thousand from the width, then take half of the remaining amount.  /  That, added to the previous ten thousand, is the koti of the salt ocean." ||1|| "Multiply the koti by one lakh five thousand, then multiply by the middle circumference of the salt ocean.  /  This will be the surface area." // 2 // "Nine hundred ninety-six koti, one hundred eighty-three lakh seventy-seven thousand.  /  This is the surface area of the salt ocean, as determined." ||3|| The calculation of the volume is as follows: The height of the salt ocean is 16000 yojanas, and the depth is one thousand yojanas, totaling seventeen thousand yojanas. Multiplying this number by the previously calculated surface area gives the volume of the salt ocean.  /  That is - 1693399155000000 yojanas  /  It is said: "Sixteen thousand yojanas is the height of the salt ocean, and one thousand yojanas is the depth.  /  Multiplying the surface area by seventeen thousand gives the volume of the salt ocean." // 1 // "Sixteen koti koti, nine hundred ninety-six koti, one hundred thousand.  /  Forty-nine thousand, nine hundred ninety-six, and fifteen." // 2 // - (On the next page)

Due to their merit, the Salt Ocean...

In the Siya-Sita-Udaga rivers, the Devas and Mahiddhiyas reside. In the Deva-Kuru and Uttara-Kuru, the Manuyas, Pagai-Bhaddayas, etc., reside. In the five Mandaras, the Devas and Mahiddhiyas reside.

The number of yojanas in the Salt Ocean is fifty thousand thousand yojanas. This is the number of yojanas in the Salt Ocean, as calculated by the Dhanaganita. // 3 //

Here, there is a doubt that the Salt Ocean is not seventeen thousand yojanas deep everywhere. In the middle, its depth is only ten thousand yojanas. How then is this Dhanaganita consistent?

This doubt is true. But when a straight line is drawn from one edge of the Salt Ocean to the other, passing over the Salt Peak and both the Bedikantas, the waterless area in between is also considered to be filled with water, according to the Karana-Gati. In this regard, the example of Mount Meru is relevant. It is said that Mount Meru has a loss of one-eleventh of its height everywhere. But this loss is not the same everywhere. It is more in some places and less in others. Only when a line is drawn from the base to the peak, the space in between, which is filled with air, is considered to be part of Mount Meru.

Considering this, the mathematicians have stated that there is a loss of one-eleventh of the height everywhere. Jinabhadragani Kshamashraman has also said the same thing in his book Visheshnavati: "Thus, from both the Bedikantas, sixteen thousand yojanas are added to the Salt Ocean. The waterless area in between is also considered to be filled with water. Just as in the case of Mount Meru, the air in between is considered to be part of the mountain, even though there is a loss of one-eleventh of its height, so also in the case of the Salt Ocean."

The meaning of this is clear from the previous explanation. -Vrittikara

[The Statement of the Deadly Continent] The statement of the Deadly Continent 174. The name of the two continents of the Salty Ocean is Dhayi-sande, which is situated in a circular shape and is surrounded by all sides. Dhayi-sande, O Venerable! Is it a circular or a non-circular wheel-shaped continent? Gotama! It is a circular wheel-shaped continent, not a non-circular wheel-shaped continent. Dhayi-sande, O Venerable! What is the extent of the wheel-shaped continent and what is its circumference? Gotama! The extent of the wheel-shaped continent is four hundred thousand yojanas, and its circumference is one hundred and twenty-one thousand yojanas, ten thousand yojanas, nine hundred yojanas, and a little more than two hundred yojanas. This is surrounded on all sides by one mountain peak and one forest, and both these are surrounded by the circumference of the ocean. Dhayi-sande, O Venerable! How many gates does the continent have? Gotama! It has four gates - Vijaya, Vaijayante, Jayante, and Aparajita. Tell me, O Venerable! Which gate is named Vijaya on the continent of Dhayi-sande? Gotama! The gate named Vijaya on the continent of Dhayi-sande is located where the great river Soyaa flows out from the eastern side of the continent of Dhayi-sande and enters the eastern side of the Salty Ocean. This is the measure. The kings of the other continents of Dhayi-sande, the two continents, should be told and informed. Thus, these four gates should be told. Dhayi-sande, O Venerable! What is the distance between the gate and the gate of the continent? Gotama! The distance between the gate and the gate of the continent is ten thousand yojanas, twenty-seven thousand yojanas, seventy-five yojanas, and three kosas. Dhayi-sande, O Venerable! Is the Salty Ocean filled with water? Yes, it is filled. Then, O Venerable! Is the Salty Ocean on the continent of Dhayi-sande? It is on Dhayi-sande, not on the Salty Ocean. Thus, it is on the Salty Ocean. Do the living beings of the continent of Dhayi-sande go to the Salty Ocean? Gotama! They go to the Salty Ocean, but they do not go to the Salty Ocean. Thus, they go to the Salty Ocean, but they do not go to the Salty Ocean. Why, O Venerable! Is it like this - Dhayi-sande continent, Dhayi-sande continent? Gotama! The two Dhayi-sandes are there, and there are Dhayi-rukkhas, Dhayi-vanas, and Dhayi-vanasandas everywhere.

[The Statement of the Third Section of the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa] [35 O Bhagavan! Where is the Vijayadvara of the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa-dvīpa located? Gautama! The Vijayadvara of the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa is located at the end of the eastern direction of the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa and in the western direction of the eastern half of the Kāloda-samudra, above the Śītā Mahānādī. / One should know its proof like the Vijayadvara of the Jambū-dvīpa. / Its capital is in another Dhātaki-khaṇḍa-dvīpa, etc., one should know its description like the Vijayā capital of the Jambū-dvīpa. In the same way, one should understand the description of all four doors including the Vijayadvara. O Bhagavan! What is the distance between one door and another door of the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa? Gautama! The distance between one door and another is ten lakh twenty-seven thousand seven hundred thirty-five (1027735) yojanas and three kosas. (The thickness of each door including the door branch is four and a half yojanas. The thickness of the four doors is 18 yojanas. Subtracting 18 yojanas from the circumference of the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa, which is 4110961 yojanas, gives 4110943 yojanas. Dividing this by four gives the said distance between each door.) Bhagavan! Are the regions of the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa-dvīpa touched by the Kāloda-samudra? Yes Gautama! They are touched. Bhagavan! Are those regions of the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa or the Kāloda-samudra? Gautama! Those regions are of the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa, not of the Kāloda-samudra. In the same way, one should say about the regions of the Kāloda-samudra. Bhagavan! Do the beings born in the Kāloda-samudra come out (die) from the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa? Gautama! Some beings are born, some beings are not born. In the same way, some beings are born in the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa-dvīpa from the Kāloda-samudra and some are not born. Bhagavan! Why is it said that the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa is the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa? Gautama! In the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa-dvīpa, here and there, Dhātaki trees, Dhātaki forests and Dhātaki forest tracts are always blooming and are situated beautifully. Two great gods named Sudarśana and Priyadarśana, who have the characteristics of Palyopama, reside on the Dhātaki Mahādhātaki trees. Therefore, the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa is called the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa. Gautama! The second thing is that the name Dhātaki-khaṇḍa is eternal. (It is eternal in relation to the substance and impermanent in relation to the synonym) Therefore, its name is eternal from the beginning of time. Bhagavan! How many moons have shone, are shining and will shine in the Dhātaki-khaṇḍa-dvīpa? How many suns were, are and will be hot? How many great planets were, are and will be moving? How many stars were, are and will be in conjunction with the moon, etc.? And how many Kodakoḍī star groups were, are and will be shining? 1.

---------------------------
[38]  **O Bhagavan!** Is the Kalodasa-samudra situated in a circular or an irregular wheel-like formation? **Gautama:** The Kalodasa-samudra is situated in a circular wheel-like formation, not in an irregular one. **O Bhagavan!** What is the diameter and circumference of the Kalodasa-samudra? **Gautama:** The Kalodasa-samudra has a diameter of eight lakh yojanas and a circumference of eighty-nine lakh seventy thousand six hundred and five yojanas, slightly more. (Its depth is one thousand yojanas.) It is surrounded by a lotus-like platform and a forest, both of which should be described. **O Bhagavan!** How many gates does the Kalodasa-samudra have? **Gautama:** The Kalodasa-samudra has four gates: Vijay, Vaijayant, Jayant, and Aparajit. **O Bhagavan!** Where is the Vijay gate of the Kalodasa-samudra located? **Gautama:** The Vijay gate of the Kalodasa-samudra is located at the eastern end of the Kalodasa-samudra, west of the eastern half of the Pushkaravaradvipa, above the Shitoda Mahandi. It is eight yojanas high, and the rest of its details should be known as per the previous description, up to the capital city. **O Bhagavan!** Where is the Vaijayant gate of the Kalodasa-samudra located? **Gautama:** The Vaijayant gate of the Kalodasa-samudra is located at the southern end of the Kalodasa-samudra, north of the southern half of the Pushkaravaradvipa. **O Bhagavan!** Where is the Jayant gate of the Kalodasa-samudra located? **Gautama:** The Jayant gate of the Kalodasa-samudra is located at the western end of the Kalodasa-samudra, east of the western half of the Pushkaravaradvipa, above the Shita Mahandi. **O Bhagavan!** Where is the Aparajit gate of the Kalodasa-samudra located? **Gautama:** The Aparajit gate of the Kalodasa-samudra is located at the northern end of the Kalodasa-samudra, south of the northern half of the Pushkaravaradvipa. The rest of its description should be known as per the Aparajit gate of the Jambudvipa. (It should be specifically mentioned that the capital city is in the Kalodasa-samudra.) **O Bhagavan!** What is the distance between two gates of the Kalodasa-samudra? **Gautama:** The distance between two gates of the Kalodasa-samudra is twenty-two lakh twenty-six thousand six hundred and forty-six yojanas and three kos. (The thickness of all four gates should be subtracted from the circumference of the Kalodasa-samudra, which is eighteen yojanas.)

## Third Rebirth: The Description of Pushkaravaradvipa

The description of Pushkaravaradvipa is as follows: 9170587 yojanas. Dividing this by 4, we get 2292646 yojanas and 3 kosas. 

O Bhagavan! Is the region of Kalod Ocean touching Pushkaravaradvipa?  

This question should be asked in the same way as before, until it is established that some beings from Pushkaravaradvipa are born in the Kalod Ocean after death, and some are not. 

O Bhagavan! Why is the Kalod Ocean called Kalod Ocean? 

Gautama! The water of the Kalod Ocean is palatable, fleshy (heavy), smooth (pleasant to taste), black, the color of a heap of black gram, and naturally sweet. Therefore, it is called Kalod. 

There reside two great gods named Kal and Mahakal, who are in the state of Palyopama. Therefore, it is called Kalod. 

Gautama! Another reason is that the Kalod Ocean is eternal, so its name is also eternal and unimitable. 

O Bhagavan! How many moons were shining in the Kalod Ocean? This question should be asked in the same way as before. 

Gautama! Forty-two moons were shining, are shining, and will shine in the Kalod Ocean. 

The scripture says that forty-two moons and forty-two suns, with their associated rays, wander in the Kalod Ocean. 

One thousand one hundred and seventy-six stars, three thousand six hundred and sixty-nine Mahagrahas, and twenty-eight lakh twelve thousand nine hundred and fifty Kodakodi stars were shining, are shining, and will shine. 

The description of Pushkaravaradvipa: 176. (a) The Kalod Ocean surrounds Pushkaravaradvipa, which is situated in the form of a circular ring, and is completely surrounded by it. It is like this until the circular ring of the Samchakkavala, and not like the circular ring of the Visamchakkavala. 

O Bhagavan! What is the diameter of the circular ring of Pushkaravaradvipa, and what is its circumference? 

Gautama! The diameter of the circular ring is sixteen thousand yojanas. One yojana is equal to one hundred thousand banas. 

The circumference of Pushkaravaradvipa is eighty-nine thousand eight hundred and forty-nine yojanas. 

It is surrounded by one Paumavaraveya and one Vanasanda. 

It has two colors. 

O Bhagavan! How many gates are there in Pushkaravaradvipa? 

Gautama! There are four gates, namely: Vijaya, Vejayante, Jayante, and Aparajita. 

O Bhagavan! Where is the gate named Vijaya in Pushkaravaradvipa? 

Gautama! It is located in the south-west of Pushkaravaradvipa, at the south-west end of the Pushkarod Ocean. 

1. The three verses present in this text were not found in the copies available to the commentator. It seems that he has quoted these three verses in his commentary by writing "Anyatrapyuktam".  - Editor 

Page #551:
---------------------------
[40] The **Jiva-Jiva-Migama Sutra** states that the **Pushkaravar-Deeva** (Pushkaravar Island) has a gate named **Vijay** (Victory). This is one of the four gates. The other three are **Vijayant**, **Jayant**, and **Aparajit**. 

**Gautama:** How far apart are these gates on the **Pushkaravar-Deeva**?

**Pushkaravar:** The distance between each gate is **122,000 yojanas**.

**Gautama:** How many **Pushkaravar-Deeva** are there?

**Pushkaravar:** There are many **Pushkaravar-Deeva** scattered throughout the universe. They are adorned with **Padma** (lotus) trees, **Padma** gardens, and **Padma** groves. These **Pushkaravar-Deeva** are inhabited by **Padma-puriya** (lotus-city dwellers), **Deva** (gods), and **Mahiddiya** (great beings). They are constantly filled with **Pali-okma** (divine light) and **Parivasan** (divine fragrance).

**Gautama:** How many **Chandra** (moon) and **Surya** (sun) illuminate the **Pushkaravar-Deeva**?

**Pushkaravar:** There are **41,000 Chandra** and **41,000 Surya** that illuminate the **Pushkaravar-Deeva**.

**Gautama:** How many **Nakshatra** (stars) are there?

**Pushkaravar:** There are **4,032 Nakshatra**.

**Gautama:** How many **Mahgagha** (great planets) are there?

**Pushkaravar:** There are **672 Mahgagha**.

**Gautama:** How many **Tara** (stars) are there?

**Pushkaravar:** There are **12,000 Tara**.

**Gautama:** How many **Pushkaravar** are there?

**Pushkaravar:** There are **664,040 Pushkaravar**.

**Gautama:** How many **Kodi-Kodi** (billions) of **Tara** (stars) adorn the **Pushkaravar**?

**Pushkaravar:** There are **400 Kodi-Kodi Tara** that adorn the **Pushkaravar**.

**(a) The Pushkaravar, a circular and ring-shaped island, surrounds the **Kalo-dasa-samudra** (ocean of time) on all sides. It is a **Sama-chakraval** (perfect circle) and not a **Vishama-chakraval** (imperfect circle).**

**Gautama:** What is the **chakraval-viskambha** (diameter) and **paridhi** (circumference) of the **Pushkaravar-Deeva**?

**Pushkaravar:** The **chakraval-viskambha** of the **Pushkaravar-Deeva** is **16 lakh yojanas** (1.6 million yojanas). Its **paridhi** is **19,289,894 yojanas**. It is surrounded by a **Padma-var-vedika** (lotus-platform) and a **vana-khanda** (forest). Both should be described.

**Gautama:** How many gates does the **Pushkaravar-Deeva** have?

**Pushkaravar:** There are four gates: **Vijay**, **Vijayant**, **Jayant**, and **Aparajit**. 

Page #552:
---------------------------
[41] **O Bhagavan! Where is the victory gate of Pushkaravaradvipa?**

**Gautama:** The victory gate of Pushkaravaradvipa is located in the eastern extremity of Pushkaravaradvipa and in the western part of the eastern half of Pushkarodasamudra. The description should be similar to that of the victory gate of Jambudvipa. Similarly, one should know the description of all four gates. However, the harmony of the Shota and Shitota rivers should not be mentioned.

**O Bhagavan! What is the distance between one gate and another of Pushkaravaradvipa?**

**Gautama:** The distance is forty-eight lakh twenty-two thousand four hundred sixty-nine (4822469) yojanas. (The thickness of all four gates is 18 yojanas. Subtracting 18 yojanas from the circumference of Pushkaravaradvipa, which is 19289894 yojanas, gives 19289876 yojanas. Dividing this amount by 4 gives the above result.)

The regions of Pushkaravaradvipa are in contact with Pushkaravarasamudra and they belong to it. Similarly, the regions of Pushkaravarasamudra are in contact with Pushkaravaradvipa and belong to it. The beings of Pushkaravaradvipa and Pushkaravarasamudra, after death, some are born in them and some are not born in them.

**O Bhagavan! Why is Pushkaravaradvipa called Pushkaravaradvipa?**

**Gautama:** In Pushkaravaradvipa, there are many Padmavaksha, Padmavana, and Pavatakhunda, which are always in bloom. There are two great gods named Padma and Pundarika, who reside on the Padma and Mahapadma trees, which are like the Palyopama. Therefore, Pushkaravaradvipa is called Pushkaravaradvipa, as long as it is eternal.

**O Bhagavan! How many moons were, are, and will be shining in Pushkaravaradvipa?**

**Gautama:** One hundred forty-four moons and one hundred forty-four suns shine and move in Pushkaravaradvipa. There are four thousand thirty-two (4032) stars and twelve thousand six hundred seventy-two (12672) Mahagrahas. Nine lakh sixty-four thousand four hundred (9644400) Kodakodi stars shine, are shining, and will shine in Pushkaravaradvipa.

**The statement of Manushottaraparvata 176.**

(Pra) Pushkaravaradvipa is called Manushottaraparvata in the middle of the many regions. It is like a ring, with a circular shape, which surrounds Pushkaravaradvipa, dividing it into two parts: the inner Pushkaradha and the outer Pushkaradha.

**O Bhagavan! What is the circumference of the inner Pushkaradha?**

**Gautama:** The circumference of the inner Pushkaradha is eight yojanas, one hundred thousand, one crore, forty-two thousand, thirty-two, and two hundred.

The circumference of Pushkaravardha is the same as that of the human realm. // 1 //

**O Bhagavan! Why is it called the inner Pushkaradha and the outer Pushkaradha?** 

Page #553:
---------------------------
[42]  Gautama! The Manushottara mountain, which is round and situated in the middle of the Pushkaravardvipa, is surrounded by a circular structure. This mountain divides the Pushkaravardvipa into two parts: the inner Pushkarardha and the outer Pushkarardha.  /  Lord! What is the diameter of the inner Pushkarardha and what is its circumference?

## 46. The Jiva-Jiva-Migama Sutra

**19.**  The moon is worshipped with fifteen parts, and the moon is also worshipped with fifteen parts.  The moon is also worshipped with fifteen parts, and the moon is also worshipped with fifteen parts.

**20.**  Thus, the moon is said to be a circle, and the moon is also said to be a circle.  The moon is also said to be a circle, and the moon is also said to be a circle.

**21.**  In the human realm, there are four types of beings.  There are five types of moons, suns, and stars.

**22.**  Beyond that, there are other moons, suns, and stars.  There are no other beings in the four directions.

**23.**  There are two moons, two suns, and four oceans of salt.  There are two moons and two suns in the Dhāyisaṇḍa.

**24.**  There are two Jambudvīpas, two suns, and twice as many moons in the salt ocean.  There are three times as many moons and suns in the Dhāyisaṇḍa.

**25.**  The Dhāyisaṇḍa is three times as large as the moon.  There are countless moons in the countless realms.

**26.**  The name of the star cluster that surrounds the sun is the "Day-Moon."  The number of stars in the star cluster is multiplied by the number of suns.

**27.**  The distance between the moon and the sun, and the sun and the moon, is fifty thousand yojanas.

**28.**  The distance between the sun and the sun, and the moon and the moon, is one hundred thousand yojanas outside the human city.

**29.**  The sun and the moon are in the sky, and the day and night are in the sky.  The mind is in the sky, and the happiness is in the sky.

**30.**  There are eighty-eight stars and twenty-eight constellations.  I will describe the family of one star.

**31.**  There are thirty-six thousand, nine hundred, and five hundred stars in the family of one star.  The number of stars in the family of one star is countless.

**32.**  The moons and suns are in the four directions outside the human city.  The moons are still in the sky, and the suns are still in the sky.

**177.**  (i) The constellations and stars are located in a mandala.  That is, they remain in one mandala for a fixed period of time.  (But this does not mean that they do not move), they also revolve around Mount Meru in a circular motion.  // 11 //  The moon and the sun do not move up and down (because that is the nature of the world). 

Page #558:

[Description of the Time-Sphere (Human-Sphere)] Their movement is transverse, from the innermost circle to the outermost circle and from the outermost circle to the innermost circle. // 12 // // The Moon, Sun, Stars, Major Planets and Stars, with their specific movements, affect the happiness and sorrow of humans. // 13 // // As the Sun and Moon enter from the outermost circle to the innermost circle, their heat-sphere increases daily, in a regular manner, in proportion to the effort (of the soul). And in the same order, as they exit from the innermost circle to the outside, the heat-sphere of the Sun and Moon decreases daily. // 14 // // The path of the heat-sphere of those Moon-Suns is like the shape of a Kadamba flower. It is narrow in the direction of Meru and wide in the direction of the Salt Sea. // 15 // // O Bhagavan! Why does the Moon increase in the waxing phase and decrease in the waning phase? What is the reason for the waning and waxing phases? // 16 // // . Gautama! The Rahu-Vimana, of dark color, always remains four fingers away from the Moon, moving below the Moon-Vimana. // (In this way, as it moves, it gradually reveals the Moon in the waxing phase and gradually covers it in the waning phase. // 17 // // In the waxing phase, the Moon increases by 62 parts of the Moon-Vimana daily, and in the waning phase, it decreases by 62 parts. [Here, the explanation of 62 parts should be done in such a way that the Moon-Vimana should be divided into 62 parts. Of these, the top two parts are naturally not capable of being covered (covered), so they should be left out. When the remaining 60 parts are divided by 15, four parts are obtained. // These four parts should be understood as the meaning of 62 parts here. Chanikara has also given a similar explanation. According to tradition, the sutra should be explained, not by one's own intellect.] // 18 // // In the waning phase, the Rahu-Vimana covers the fifteenth part of the Moon-Vimana with its fifteenth part, and in the waxing phase, it releases that same fifteenth part. // 19 // // In this way, the Moon increases and decreases, and for this reason, there are waning and waxing phases. // 20 // // Within the Human-Sphere, there are five types of celestial bodies: Moon, Sun, Planets, Stars and Stars, which are in motion. // 21 // // Beyond (outside) the two and a half islands, the five types of Moon, Sun, Planets, Stars and Stars do not move, do not move (from the circular motion), therefore they are situated (stationary). // 22 // // _ In this Jambudvipa, there are two Moons and two Suns. In the Salt Sea, there are four Moons and four Suns. In the Ghataki-Khanda, there are twelve Moons and twelve Suns. // 23 // // In Jambudvipa, there are two Moons and two Suns. // There are twice as many in the Salt Sea, and three times as many Moons and Suns in the Ghataki-Khanda as there are in the Salt Sea. // 24 // //

## Translation:

**[Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra, Dhataki-Khand]**

**[Regarding the number of Moons and Suns in the oceans and islands beyond the Ghataki-Khand]**

The number of Moons and Suns in the oceans and islands beyond the Ghataki-Khand should be tripled from the number in the previous ocean or island, and then the total number of Moons and Suns from all the previous oceans and islands should be added to it. (For example, if there are 12 Moons and 12 Suns in the Ghataki-Khand, then there would be 12 x 3 = 36 Moons and Suns in the Kalodadhi Ocean. Adding the 2 Moons and Suns from Jambudvipa and 4 Moons and Suns from the Lavana Ocean, the total number of Moons and Suns in the Kalodadhi Ocean would be 42.) This method can be used to determine the number of Moons and Suns in the subsequent islands and oceans. // 25 //

**[Regarding the number of stars, planets, and Kodakodo stars in the islands and oceans]**

To determine the number of stars, planets, and Kodakodo stars in any island or ocean, multiply the number of Moons and Suns in that island or ocean by the number of stars, planets, and Kodakodo stars in one Moon's family. (For example, there are 4 Moons in the Lavana Ocean. Each Moon's family has 28 stars, so there would be 28 x 4 = 112 stars in the Lavana Ocean. Each Moon's family has 88 planets, so there would be 88 x 4 = 352 planets in the Lavana Ocean. Each Moon's family has 66,975 Kodakodo stars, so there would be 66,975 x 4 = 267,900 Kodakodo stars in the Lavana Ocean.) // 26 //

**[Regarding the distance between Moons and Suns outside the Manushya-Kshetra]**

The distance between Moons and Suns outside the Manushya-Kshetra is 50,000 yojanas. This distance should be understood as the distance from one Moon to one Sun and from one Sun to one Moon. // 27 //

**[Regarding the distance between Suns and Moons outside the Manushya-Kshetra]**

The distance between Suns and Suns and between Moons and Moons outside the Manushya-Kshetra is 100,000 yojanas. // 28 //

**[Regarding the nature of Moons and Suns outside the Manushya-Kshetra]**

The Moons and Suns outside the Manushya-Kshetra are arranged in rows and are illuminated by their own brilliance. Their distance and the nature of their light are unique and varied. (The light of the Moon is cool, and the light of the Sun is warm. The light of these Moons and Suns, being different from each other, is neither extremely cold nor extremely warm like the Manushya-Kshetra, but rather pleasant.) // 29 //

**[Regarding the number of planets and stars in one Moon's family]**

One Moon's family has 88 planets and 28 stars. The number of stars will be explained in the following verses. // 30 //

**[Regarding the number of Kodakodo stars in one Moon's family]**

One Moon's family has 66,975 Kodakodo stars. // 31 //

**[Regarding the nature of Moons and Suns outside the Manushya-Kshetra]**

The Moons and Suns outside the Manushya-Kshetra are situated in a way that is conducive to well-being. The Moons are associated with the Abhijit Nakshatra, and the Suns are associated with the Pushya Nakshatra. (Some texts mention "Avatt-hiya Te-ya," which means "situated with brilliance." This indicates that there is no extreme heat or cold in these regions, unlike the Manushya-Kshetra.) // 32 //

**[Explanation of the verses]**

The above verses are self-explanatory. The 13th verse states that the movements of these Moons, Suns, stars, planets, and Kodakodo stars influence the happiness and sorrow of humans. The commentator explains this by saying that human actions are always of two types: auspicious and inauspicious. The causes of the results of actions are generally five: substance, place, time, feeling, and birth. 

Page #560:
---------------------------
[Description of the Time-Field (Human-Field)] The causes of the rise, decline, decline-cessation, and cessation of karma have been described. Substance, field, time, state, and existence are the causes. // 1 //  That is, substance, field, time, state, and existence are the causes of the rise, decline, decline-cessation, and cessation of karma. Generally, auspicious substances, fields, etc. are the causes of the fruition of auspicious karma, and inauspicious substances, fields, etc. are the causes of the fruition of inauspicious karma. Therefore, when the movement of the moon, etc. is favorable to the birth star, etc. of individuals, then the auspicious karma of those individuals, along with the various materials of fruition, arise, due to which the body experiences health, wealth, cessation of enmity, association with loved ones, success in endeavors, etc., resulting in happiness. / Therefore, a highly discerning and intelligent person begins any work on an auspicious day, star, etc., regardless of whether it is necessary or not. The Tirthankaras also command that acts like renunciation (initiation) should be performed in an auspicious field, facing an auspicious direction, at an auspicious day, star, etc., as stated in the Panchvastik Granth. Such is the knowledge of the Jinas, who have described the field of karma. / The cause of the rise is what should be honored everywhere. // 1 // Therefore, those who are in the state of a seeker should be mindful of auspicious fields and auspicious moments. Those who are supremely knowledgeable, the Bhagavants, know the presence or absence of obstacles by virtue of their supreme knowledge, and therefore they do not rely on auspicious days, stars, etc. / It is not appropriate for seekers to do the same. Those who say that the Bhagavants did not observe auspicious days, etc., for those who came to them for renunciation, are incorrect. / The Bhagavants are supremely knowledgeable. It is not appropriate for seekers to imitate them. / Therefore, it is appropriate to begin work on auspicious days, etc., at auspicious moments. In this way, the movement of the planets, etc., becomes a cause of happiness and sorrow for humans. 178. (a) "Venerable sir, what is the height of Mount Meru in man-yojanas? What is its width? What is its diameter at the base? What is its diameter at the peak? What is its circumference at the base? What is its circumference at the outer edge? What is its circumference at the middle?

[52] The human realm extends as far as lunar eclipses, solar eclipses, lunar halos, solar halos, counter-moons, counter-suns, rainbows, aquatic fish, and monkey laughter, etc. The human realm extends as far as the arrival, departure, waxing and waning of the moon, and the continuous movement of the moon, sun, planets, stars, and constellations, which is called the state of being in motion. 

**Explanation:** This sutra states that the human realm encompasses everything from the Bharatadi year (region), the Varshdhar mountain, houses, shops, buildings, villages, cities, capitals, praiseworthy men like Arihantas, etc., virtuous and humble humans like Prakritibhradrikas, time, etc., to electricity, thunder, cloud formation, lightning, mines, rivers, treasures, wells, ponds, and the movement of the moon, sun, etc., in the sky. The implication is that all of these things exist only within the human realm. They do not exist outside of it. The Manushottara mountain is called so because it marks the boundary of the human realm. Beyond the Manushottara mountain, there is no existence of these substances and activities.

**Explanation of the Time Cycle:** The sutra mentions the time cycle, so an explanation is necessary. The smallest unit of time, which cannot be further divided, is called "samaya." To understand its subtlety, the scholars have given a gross example. 

For example, a young, strong, healthy, and skilled tailor's son, upon taking a worn-out shawl in his hand, tears it apart immediately without even extending his hand. To the onlookers, it seems like he tore the shawl in an instant. However, from a true perspective, countless "samayas" were involved in tearing the shawl. The shawl is made of countless threads. The lower thread cannot be torn without the upper thread being torn first. It must be understood that each thread has its own time of tearing. Even that thread is made of many fibers. These fibers also tear in sequence. Therefore, the time taken for the upper fiber of the upper thread to tear is much subtler than the time taken for the upper thread to tear. 

There are countless "samayas" in a "pravalika." There are countless "pravalikas" in an "uccvasa," and countless "pravalikas" in a "nishvasa." One "uccvasa" and one "nishvasa" together make one "an-pran." 

**Meaning:** The time taken for one breath of a healthy and happy person, who is free from labor, hunger, etc., is called "an-pran." Seven "pran-pranas" make one "stoka," and seven "stokas" make one "lava."

**The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra, Venerable One!**

Are the celestial bodies, such as the Moon, Sun, planets, constellations, and stars, outside the human realm, *Uvopapanna*, *Kalpopapanna*, *Vimanopapanna*, mobile, or stationary? Are they desirous of motion, and have they attained motion?

**Gautama:** Those deities are not *Uvopapanna*, nor *Kalpopapanna*, but *Vimanopapanna*. They are not mobile, they are stationary. They are not desirous of motion, nor have they attained motion.

They are the size of a baked brick, and their sphere of heat extends for millions of yojanas. They experience divine enjoyments with the loud sounds of musical instruments, dances, songs, and the sweet melodies of instruments, along with thousands of external assemblies of deities who are *Vikurvita*.

They are radiant with auspicious light, their rays are cool and gentle, their heat and light are not intense, and their light is of a peculiar kind.

They are situated in one place, like a peak. The light of these Moons and Suns, etc., is mixed with each other. They illuminate, irradiate, heat, and brighten that region from all sides with their combined rays of light.

**Venerable One!** When the Indra of these deities passes away, what do they do?

**Gautama:** Until four or five *Samanika* deities collectively take his place, they continue to function until another Indra is born there.

**Lord!** For how long is that Indra-position devoid of an Indra?

**Gautama:** The Indra-position can be devoid of an Indra for a minimum of one time period and a maximum of six months.

**The Description of the Pushkarod-Sea**

**180. (a)** The Pushkarod-Sea is named Pushkaravar, and it is situated in a circular enclosure, like a ring, and is surrounded by a wall.

**Venerable One!** What is the circumference of the wheel-wall of the Pushkarod-Sea, and what is its perimeter?

**Gautama:** It has a circumference of countless hundreds of thousands of yojanas, and a perimeter of countless hundreds of thousands of yojanas.

**How many gates does the Pushkarod-Sea have?**

**Gautama:** It has four gates. Similarly, all the cities situated on the Pushkarod-Sea, including the city of Varuna-Varada, are situated on the western side. Here, on the Pushkarod-Sea, there is a gate named Vijaya. The same applies to the other gates.

There is a distance of countless hundreds of thousands of yojanas between the gates.

**The Jivas in the Region**

**Venerable One!** Why is it called Pushkarod-Pushkarod?

**Gautama:** On the eastern side of the Pushkarod-Sea, there are two deities named Siridhara and Siriprabha, who are born from the fine, fragrant, and reddish-brown dust that falls from the sky. They wander from the Mahiddhiya to the Paliovamattiya.

This is why it is called Pushkarod-Pushkarod.

Now, it is like this:  O Gautama! The water of the Kṣodod ocean is more desirable than even the best sugarcane juice, and it satisfies the mind.  What is the water of the Kṣodod like?  It is like the sugarcane juice that is delicious, thick, well-rested, smooth, and delicate, which is planted in the land that has been ploughed by a skilled farmer with a beautiful and special wooden plough, which is protected by a skilled man, which has grown in a weed-free land, which has become pure and thick due to ripening, which is filled with sweet juice, which is free from the disturbance of winter animals, which has been extracted by strong oxen with a machine after removing the upper and lower root parts and also its knots, which has been strained through cloth, and which has been mixed with four types of fragrant substances (cinnamon, cardamom, saffron, black pepper), which is more digestible and easy to digest, and which is endowed with good colour, smell, taste, and touch.

It is made entirely of anjanaratna, a type of gemstone, and is adorned with padmavaravedikas (lotus-like platforms) and vanakhandas (forests). Each anjanapravata (mountain of anjanaratna) has a vast and beautiful land, as smooth as the stretched skin of a mridanga (drum), where many vanavyantar devatas (celestial beings) reside and enjoy the fruits of their good deeds. In the center of these beautiful lands are siddayatanas (abodes of the perfected), each measuring 100 yojanas in length, 50 yojanas in width, and 72 yojanas in height, supported by hundreds of pillars. These siddayatanas have four gates on each side: devadara (gate of the gods), asuradara (gate of the asuras), nagadara (gate of the nagas), and suvannadara (gate of gold).

The rest should be known as before / All the islands and seas beyond the Ruchakoda sea, their vishkambha, circumference, doors, spaces between doors, and the number of jyotishkas - all these should be said to be countless. Surrounding the Ruchakoda sea on all sides is the island named Ruchakavar, which is round, etc., one should state until there are two mahadhika devas named Ruchakavarabhadhra and Ruchakavarmahaabhadhra / In the Ruchakavarodasamudra, there are two devas named Ruchakavar and Ruchakavarmahaavar, who are mahadhika.

In this way, one should invent the names of the three avatars and the devas everywhere. By adding the words "Bhadhra" and "Mahaabhadhra" to the names of the islands and the word "Var" to the names of the seas, the names of the devas of those islands and seas are formed, until 1. Suryadvipa, 2. Suryasamudra, 3. Suryavardvipa, 4. Suryavarasamudra, 5. Suryavaraabhaasadvipa, and 6. Suryavaraavbhaasasamudra, there are respectively 1. Suryabhadhra and Suryamahaabhadhra, 2.

On this, Gautama asks if that water is like the aforementioned similes? To this, the Lord says, "No" this is not right, that water is said to be even more desirable than that. Bhagavan!

Like the Goksheera (cow's milk) which is transformed into Chaturstan for the Chaturrant Chakravarti, which is cooked on a slow fire, mixed with sugar at the beginning and end, which is superior in color, smell, taste and touch, such is that water. This is just a simile, that water is even more desirable than this. The taste of the water of the Ghritoadasamudra is like the Mand (essence-thara) of cow's ghee in the autumn season, which is of the color of Sallaki and Kaner flowers, well heated, immediately filtered and which is endowed with superior color, smell, taste and touch. This is just a simile, the water of the Ghritoadasamudra is even more desirable than this. Bhagavan! How is the water of the Kshodoadasamudra in taste? Gautama!

This is just a simile, the water of the Kshodoadasamudra is even more desirable than this. In the same way, one should know the taste of the water of the remaining oceans up to the Swayambhuramanasamudra. The special feature is that that water is as pure, noble and wholesome as the water of Pushkarod. Bhagavan! How many oceans are said to be of each taste? Gautama! Four oceans are of each taste, i.e. that taste is not found in any other ocean. They are - Lavana, Varunod, Kshirodas and Ghritoadas / Bhagavan! How many oceans are naturally of Udgarasa? Gautama!

"83. O Bhagavan! How far from the Chandra Vimana does the highest star move? Gautama! The highest star moves twenty yojanas from the Chandra Vimana.

54] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra Bhagavan! What is the diameter of the Chandra Vimana? What is its circumference? And what is its thickness? Gautama! The diameter of the Chandra Vimana is 56 parts out of 61 parts of a Yojana (11). Its circumference is slightly more than three times its diameter. Its thickness is 28 parts out of 61 parts of a Yojana (16). The same question has been asked about the Surya Vimana. Gautama! The Surya Vimana is 48 parts out of 61 parts of a Yojana long and wide, its circumference is slightly more than three times its diameter, and its thickness is 24 parts out of 61 parts of a Yojana (34).

The Tara Vimana is half a Kos long and wide, its circumference is slightly more than three times its diameter, and its thickness is five hundred Dhanush. Discussion: In this Sutra, the size of the Chandra and other Vimana is described as being similar to the shape of half a Kabitha. Here, there may be a doubt that when the shape of the Chandra and others is like half a Kabitha, why is that shape not seen at the time of sunrise, at the time of full moon when it travels sideways? In response to this, it has been said that: Only the round back of the Chandra Vimana, which is shaped like half a Kabitha, is seen by the men living here; its flat part, like the Hastamalaka, is not seen. Above that back is the Mahaprasad of Chandradeva, which is not clearly visible to the naked eye due to its distance. 194. (a) Chandra Vimana, Bhagavan! How many Deva Sahasris carry it? Gautama!

Eight thousand Devas carry it in the direction of the east. Two thousand Devas carry it from the east, two thousand Devas carry it from the south, two thousand Devas carry it from the west, and two thousand Devas carry it from the north.

In the same way, four thousand Devas carry it from all four directions. And what about the tail of the Tara-vimāna? Gotama! Two thousand Devas carry it in the direction of the east. Five hundred Devas carry it from each of the four directions. 194. (u) The same question should be asked about the Surya-vimāna. Gotama!

Eight thousand Devas carry the Graha-vimāna. Two thousand Devas carry it from the east, two thousand Devas carry it from the south, two thousand Devas carry it from the west, and two thousand Devas carry it from the north.

The Surya is faster than the Chandra, the Graha is faster than the Surya, the Nakshatra is faster than the Graha, and the Tara is faster than the Nakshatra.

The Nakshatra is of greater power than the Tara, the Graha is of greater power than the Nakshatra, the Surya is of greater power than the Graha, and the Chandra is of greater power than the Surya. The Tara is of the least power and the Chandra is of the greatest power.

90] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra . 196. (a) Bhagavan! In Jambudvipa, what is the distance between one star and another star said to be? Gautama! The distance is of two types, namely - Vyaghatim (artificial) and Nivvaghatim (natural). The Vyaghatim distance is said to be the least two hundred sixty-six (266) yojanas and the greatest twelve thousand two hundred forty-two (12242) yojanas. The Nivvaghatim distance is to be known as the least five hundred dhanus and the greatest two kosas. (The Nishadha and Neelavant mountains are 250 yojanas long and wide from their peaks / The constellation moves from both sides of the peak leaving eight yojanas on each side, therefore, adding 16 to 250 gives the distance of 266 yojanas / The greatest distance is from the perspective of Meru. Meru is ten thousand yojanas wide and the constellation moves leaving 1120 yojanas on both sides. In this way, adding 2242 to ten thousand yojanas gives the greatest distance.) Bhagavan! How many Aggramahisi are there for Jyotishindra Jyotishraja Chandra? Gautama! There are four Aggramahisi, namely - Chandraprabha, Jyotsnaabha, Achimali and Prabhankara / Each of these Aggramahisi can control four thousand other Devis. In this way, the total family of Devis becomes sixteen thousand. This is the statement of Chandradeva's "Tudia" inner palace. 196. (a) Bhagavan! Does Chandra, Jyotishraja, reside in the Chandradisa Vimana, in the Sabha, in the Suhammaa, on the Chandrasimhasana, along with the Tudia, enjoying divine pleasures? It is not appropriate to say so / Bhagavan! Why is it said that Chandra, Jyotishraja, does not reside in the Chandradisa Vimana, in the Sabha, in the Suhammaa, on the Chandrasimhasana, along with the Tudia, enjoying divine pleasures? Gautama! Jyotishindra Jyotishraja Chandra, in the Chandradisa Vimana, in the Sabha, in the Suhammaa, on the Manavagamsa, on the Cheiyakhamba, in the Vairamaesa, in the Golavattasamugga, there are many Jinasakhanas, which are well-established, as if they are present.

[91]  The Jyotishka Chandra-Surya-Adhikara:  "Gautama, are the Jyotishis, the Devas and the Devis, who are the Jyotishis, worthy of being worshipped and served?  Gautama:  Yes, they are.  Because of them, the Jyotishraja Chandra is not able to enjoy the pleasures of the Chandravatamsaka Vimana, the Chandra Simhasana, or the Bhoga-Bhoga.  Therefore, it is said that the Jyotishraja Chandra is not able to enjoy the pleasures of the Chandravatamsaka Vimana, the Sudharma Sabha, the Chandra Simhasana, or the Bhoga-Bhoga with his inner circle.  Gautama:  Another thing is that the Jyotishraja Chandra is able to enjoy the pleasures of the Chandravatamsaka Vimana, the Sudharma Sabha, the Chandra Simhasana, with his four thousand Samanika Devas, sixteen thousand Atmarakshaka Devas, and many other Jyotishis, Devas, and Devis, by the sound of the dance, song, music, string instruments, tal, taal, trutit, dhan, and mridanga.  But he is not able to enjoy the pleasures of the Bhoga-Bhoga with his inner circle.  196. (a)  Bhagavan!  Is the Jyotishkendra Jyotishraja Chandra able to enjoy the pleasures of the Bhoga-Bhoga with his inner circle in the Chandravatamsaka Vimana, the Sudharma Sabha, and the Chandra Simhasana?  Gautama:  No, he is not.  Bhagavan!  Why is it said that the Jyotishraja Chandra is not able to enjoy the pleasures of the Bhoga-Bhoga with his inner circle in the Chandravatamsaka Vimana, the Sudharma Sabha, and the Chandra Simhasana?  Gautama:  In the Chandravatamsaka Vimana, the Sudharma Sabha, the Manavaka Chaitya Stambha, and the Vajmaya Gol Manjusha of the Jyotishkendra Jyotishraja Chandra, there are many bones of the Jinas, which are worthy of being worshipped and served by the Jyotishkendra Jyotishraja Chandra and many other Jyotishis, Devas, and Devis.  Because of them, the Jyotishraja Chandra is not able to enjoy the pleasures of the Chandravatamsaka Vimana, the Chandra Simhasana, or the Bhoga-Bhoga.  Therefore, it is said that the Jyotishraja Chandra is not able to enjoy the pleasures of the Bhoga-Bhoga with his inner circle in the Chandravatamsaka Vimana, the Sudharma Sabha, and the Chandra Simhasana.

But he is not able to enjoy the pleasures of the Bhoga-Bhoga with his inner circle.  196. (b)  Bhagavan!  How many Aggamahisis does the Jyotishkendra Jyotishraja Surya have?

It is long, wide in the north-south, situated in the shape of a crescent moon, radiant like a mass of flames, with an immeasurable length, breadth and circumference of kotis of yojanas, and is made of all gems. In this Saudharma-Vimana there are thirty-two lakh Vimana-Avasas. In the middle of these Vimanas there are five Avatansakas, called - 1. Ashoka-Avatansak, 2. Saptaparna-Avatansak, 3.

The inner council has two hundred and fifty gods, the middle council has five hundred gods, and the outer council has one thousand gods. The position of the inner council is nineteen Sagaropama and five Palyopama, the position of the middle council is nineteen Sagaropama and four Palyopama, and the position of the outer council is nineteen Sagaropama and three Palyopama.  /  The eighth one is also  /  Say, Master! The vimanas of the Aran-Acyuta gods are also said to be there, with their families, as long as they live.  /  The Devendra Acyuta has three councils.  /  The inner council has one hundred and twenty-five gods, the middle council has two hundred and fifty gods, and the outer council has five hundred gods.  /  The position of the gods of the inner council is twenty-one Sagaropama and seven Palyopama, the position of the gods of the middle council is twenty-one Sagaropama and six Palyopama, and the position of the gods of the outer council is twenty-one Sagaropama and five Palyopama. Say, Master! What is the position of the vimanas of the gods of the lower Gevejjagaga? Say, Master! Where do the gods of the lower Gevejjagaga live? Just as in the place of the Thaṇapade, so also in the middle Gevejjagaga, the upper Gevejjagaga, and the Anuttara, as long as the gods named Ahmida are said to be there, O Samanau! 199 (In response to the question about the Pranat Devaloka, it is said that the Pranat Deva has three councils.  /  The inner council has two hundred and fifty gods, the middle council has five hundred gods, and the outer council has one thousand gods. The position of the gods of the inner council is nineteen Sagaropama and five Palyopama, the position of the gods of the middle council is nineteen Sagaropama and four Palyopama, and the position of the gods of the outer council is nineteen Sagaropama and three Palyopama. The meaning of the councils should be taken as before.  /  O Bhagavan! Where are the vimanas of the Aran-Acyuta gods said to be? etc. should be said, as long as the Devendra Devaraj Acyuta lives there with his family. The Devendra Devaraj Acyuta has three councils.  /  The inner council has one hundred and twenty-five gods, the middle council has two hundred and fifty gods, and the outer council has five hundred gods.  /  The position of the gods of the inner council is twenty-one Sagaropama and seven Palyopama,

Of those that are Avaliya-Bahya, they are classified according to their knowledge. This continues up to the Graveyaka Vimana. The Anuttara-Upavaiya Vimana is classified in two ways: 1. Batte and 2. Tansa. Bhagavan! In the Saudharma-Ishana kalpa, how are the Vimana classified in terms of their base and diameter, and how are they classified in terms of their circumference? Gautama! They are classified in two ways: 1. Sankhejjaviththada and 2. Asankhejjaviththada. Just as in the Paraga, so too up to the Anuttara-Upavaiya, they are Sankhejjaviththada and Asankhejjaviththada. Of those that are Sankhejjaviththada, they are the size of Jambudvipa. The Asankhejjaviththada are classified in terms of their circumference as being as many as countless yojanas. Bhagavan! In the Saudharma-Ishana kalpa, what colors are the Vimana? Gautama! They are classified in five colors: 1. Kina, 2. Nila, 3. Lohiya, 4. Halidda, and 5. Sukkila.

They are classified as being of the Nitchaloya, Nitchujjoya, and Sayamphaba light, up to the Anuttara-Upavaiya Vimana, which are classified as being of the Nitchaloya, Nitchujjoya, and Sayamphaba light. Bhagavan! In the Saudharma-Ishana kalpa, how are the Vimana classified in terms of their fragrance? Gautama! They are classified as having the fragrance of the Agaru wood, up to the Anuttara Vimana. Bhagavan! In the Saudharma-Ishana kalpa, how are the Vimana classified in terms of their touch?

The **Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra** describes **Pravalika-Pravisht** (row-aligned) **Vimanas** as being of three types: 1. **Gola** (round), 2. **Trikon** (triangular), and 3. **Chatushkon** (quadrilateral).  **Pravalika-Bahya** (external) Vimanas are of various types.  The same statement should be made for **Veyak-Vimanas**.  **Anuttaropapattik** Vimanas are of two types: **Gola** and **Trikon**.

**Lord!** What are the length and width of the Vimanas in the **Saudharma-Ishana Kalpa**?  **Gautama!** These Vimanas are of two types: those with a **Sankhyat Yojana** (countable yojana) extent and those with an **Asankhyat Yojana** (uncountable yojana) extent.  

Just as the **Narakas** (hells) have been described, so too should the **Anuttaropapattik Vimanas** be described as being of two types: those with a **Sankhyat Yojana** extent and those with an **Asankhyat Yojana** extent.  Those with a **Sankhyat Yojana** extent are the size of **Jambudvipa**, and those with an **Asankhyat Yojana** extent are said to have an extent and circumference of **Asankhyat** thousands of **Yojanas**.

**Lord!** What are the colors of the Vimanas in the **Saudharma-Ishana Kalpa**?  **Gautama!** The Vimanas are of all five colors: **Krishna** (black), **Neela** (blue), **Lal** (red), **Pila** (yellow), and **Shukla** (white).  In the **Sanatkumar** and **Mahendra Kalpas**, the Vimanas are of four colors: **Neela** to **Shukla**.  In the **Brahmaloka** and **Lantank Kalpas**, the Vimanas are of three colors: **Lal** to **Shukla**.  In the **Mahashaka** and **Sahasrar Kalpas**, the Vimanas are of two colors: **Pila** and **Shukla**.  In the **Panat**, **Pranat**, **Parana**, and **Achyut Kalpas**, the Vimanas are **Shukla** (white).  **Veyak-Vimanas** are also **Shukla**.  **Anuttaropapattik Vimanas** are of the **Param-Shukla** (supreme white) color.

**Lord!** What is the **Prabha** (radiance) of the Vimanas in the **Saudharma-Ishana Kalpa**?  **Gautama!** These Vimanas are eternally radiant with their own **Prabha** and eternally luminous.  The same should be said for **Anuttaropapattik Vimanas**.

**Lord!** What is the **Gandha** (smell) of the Vimanas in the **Saudharma-Ishana Kalpa**?  **Gautama!** Their smell is even more pleasant than the smell of fragrant substances like **Kosthapudha** (sandalwood).  The same should be said for **Anuttara-Vimanas**.

**Lord!** What is the **Sparsha** (touch) of the Vimanas in the **Saudharma-Ishana Kalpa**?  **Gautama!** Their touch should be like the soft touch of **Ajin** (leather), **Charma** (skin), or **Ruyi** (cotton).  The same should be said for **Anuttaropapattik Vimanas**.

**Lord!** In the **Sohma-Isana Kalpas**, how are the Vimanas situated?  **Gautama!** In **Jambudvipa**, there are two **Savvadova-Samuddas** (oceans) and the **Gama** (city) extends up to the **Chhammasa** (six months) and the **Vimanas** are situated up to the **Atthagaiya** (eight months).  The **Anuttaropapattik Vimanas** are situated up to the **Atthagaiya**, and beyond that, there are no Vimanas.

**Lord!** In the **Sohma-Isana Kalpas**, what are the Vimanas made of?  **Gautama!** They are made of **Savvarayana** (all kinds of materials).  Many **Jivas** (living beings) and **Poggala** (liberated souls) wander, move about, gather, and disperse there.  The Vimanas are **Sasa** (with doors) up to the **Phasaprajjava** (a type of Vimana) and **Asasa** (without doors) up to the **Anuttaropapattik Vimanas**.

**Lord!** In the **Sohma-Isana Kalpas**, how do the **Devas** (gods) move about?  **Gautama!** They move about in the same way as the **Tiryamana** (animals), **Manushya** (humans), and **Panchidia** (birds) in the **Sammuchhima** (middle world), except that they move about in a **Vakkatima** (straight line) up to the **Anuttaropapattik Vimanas**.

In response to the question regarding the arrival of Jiva, it should be said that they are countless. Therefore, even if the process of taking away one at a time continues until the countless part of the Palopam, their removal cannot be completed. (This removal never happened, will not happen, it is only a figment of imagination to tell the number.) 201. (E) In the Sohammisanes, O Venerable! What is the nature of the bodies of the gods in the Kalpas? Gotama! The nature of the body is twofold, namely, Bhavadharanija and Uttaraveumbiya. / There, the Bhavadharanija is as many parts of an angula as there are countless, and in terms of height, it is seventy yojanas. There, the Uttaraveumbiya is as many parts of an angula as there are countless, and in terms of height, it is a hundred thousand yojanas. / Thus, one by one, until the last one is a yojana. There is no Uttaraveumbiya body for the last Bhavadharanija. / In the Sohammisanes, O Venerable! What is the nature of the bodies of the gods in terms of their assembly? Gotama! The nature of the assembly is sixfold. / There is no end, no beginning, no assembly; those beings who are desired, until they reach this assembly, they become until they reach the last. / In the Sohammisanes, O Venerable! What is the nature of the bodies of the gods in terms of their structure? Gotama! The body is twofold, Bhavadharanija and Uttaraveumbiya. / There, the Bhavadharanija is of the nature of the structure of the Samachauransa, / There, the Uttaraveumbiya is of the nature of the structure of the Nana, until it reaches the last. The last Bhavadharanija is of the nature of the structure of the Samachauransa, there is no Uttaraveumbiya. / In the Sohammisanes, what is the nature of the gods in terms of their color? Gotama! They are of the color of Kanagatayarattama. In the Sanankumaramahide, they are of the color of Paumpapamhagora. In the Brahmaloka, O Venerable! Gotama! They are of the color of Allamadugavannabha. / Thus, until the last, / They are of the color of Paramasukilla, which is the last. In the Sohammisanes, O Venerable!

They are of the smell of the earth, like the smell of a Kothupuda, and also of the smell of all the Manamataraga. Until the last. / In the Sohammisanes, O Venerable! What is the nature of the bodies of the gods in terms of their touch? Gotama!

Those beings who are desired, until they reach this, become Ussasatta, until they reach the last; thus, they also become Praharatta, until they reach the last. What are the Leasas of the Sohammisanes? Gotama! They are of one Teuleassa. In the Sanankumaramahide, they are of one Pamhaleassa. Thus, in the Brahmaloka, they are of one Pamha, and in the rest, they are of one Sukkaleassa; the last ones are of one Paramasukkaleassa. What are the Sambhatthi, Micchaditthi, and Sammamichchavitthi of the Sohammisanes? They are of three kinds, until the last, the Gevejjades, they are of Sammavitthi, Micchavitthi, and Sammamichchavitthi. / The last ones are of Sammavitthi, neither Micchaditthi nor Sammamichchaditthi.

Uttravaikriy sharir ki apeksha se jghanya angul ka sankhyatvaan bhaag aur utkrisht ek lakh yojan hai. Is prakar aage-aage ke kalpon mein ek-ek hath kam karte jana chahiye, yavat anuttaropapathik devon ki ek hath ki avagahana rah jati hai / (Jaise Sanatkumar-Mahendra kalpa mein utkrisht bhavadharaniy sharir ki avagahana chhah hath praman, Brahmalok-Lantk mein panch hath, Mahashukra-Sahasrar mein char hath, Pranat-Pranat-Paran-Achyut mein tin hath, Navgraiveyak mein do hath aur Anantar vimanon mein ek hath praman avagahana hai.) Graiveykon aur Anuttara vimanon mein kewal bhavadharaniy sharir hota hai / Ve dev uttarvikriya nahin karte / Bhagavan! Soudharma-Isan kalpa mein devon ke sharir ka sanhanan kaunsa hai? Gautam! Chhah sanhananon mein se ek bhi sanhanan unmein nahin hota; kyonki unke sharir mein na haddi hoti hai, na shiraen hoti hain aur na nasen hi hoti hain. Atah ve asanhanni hain. Jo pudgal isht, kant yavat manojn-manam hote hain, ve unke sharir roop mein ektrit hokar thatharoop mein parinat hote hain / Yahi kathn anuttaropapathik devon tak kahna chahiye. Bhagavan! Soudharma-Isan kalpa mein devon ke sharir ka sansthan kaisa hai? Gautam! Unke sharir do prakar ke hain- bhavadharaniy aur uttarvaikriy / Jo bhavadharaniy sharir hai, uska samchaturasrasansthan hai aur jo uttarvakriy sharir hai, unka sansthan (aakar) nana prakar ka hota hai. Yah kathn Achyut devlok tak kahna chahiye. Praiveyak aur Anuttara vimanon ke dev uttar-vikurvana nahin karte / Unka bhavadharaniy sharir samchaturasrasansthan wala hai. Uttravikriya vahan nahin hai. Bhagavan! Soudharma-Isan ke devon ke sharir ka varn kaisa hai? Gautam! Tape hue svarn ke saman lal abhayukt unka varn hai. Sanatkumar aur Mahendra kalpa ke devon ka varn padma, kamal ke parag (keshar) ke saman gaur hai. Brahmalok ke dev gile mahue ke varn vale (safed) hain / Isi prakar graiveyak devon tak safed varn kahna chahiye / Anuttaropapathik devon ke sharir ka varn parmashukla hai. Bhagavan! Soudharma-Isan kalpon ke devon ke sharir ki gandh kaisi hai? Gautam! Jaise kosthaput adi sugandhit dravyo ki sugandh hoti hai, usse bhi adhik isht, kant yavat manam unke sharir ki gandh hoti hai. Anuttaropapathik devon paryant aisa hi kathn karna chahiye.

10] [Jivajivaabhigamsutra Bhagavan! How is the touch of the bodies of the gods of the Saudharma-Ishaan kalpas described? Gautama! Their bodies are described as having a stable, soft, smooth and supple image.  /  The same should be said for the Anuttaroppapatik Devas. Bhagavan! How do pudgalas transform into the breath of the Saudharma-Ishaan Devas? Gautama! The pudgalas that are desirable, radiant, pleasing, attractive and delightful, they transform into their breath. This statement should be said up to the Anuttaroppapatik Devas and the same should be known about the pudgalas that transform into their food. This statement should be understood up to the Anuttaroppapatik Devas. Bhagavan! How many leshyas do the Devas of the Saudharma-Ishaan Devaloka have? Gautama! They have only one Tejo leshya. Sanatkumar and Mahendra have one Padma leshya, Brahmaloka also has Pala leshya. The rest all have only Shukla leshya.  /  The Anuttaroppapatik Devas have Paramshukla leshya. Bhagavan!

They are of both types.  /  Those who are knowledgeable are, by rule, those with three knowledges and those who are ignorant are, by rule, those with three ignorances. This statement should be made up to the Greveyaka Vimanas. The Anuttaroppapatik Devas are only knowledgeable - not ignorant. In this way, there is a rule of three knowledges and three ignorances up to the Aveyaka Devas. The Anuttaroppapatik Devas are only knowledgeable - not ignorant. They always have three knowledges by rule. In the same way, three yogas and two uses should also be said about those Devas. From Saudharma-Ishaan to Anuttaroppapatik, all Devas have three yogas and two uses. Avadhikshetraadi Prarupan 202. In the Saudharma-Ishaan, how much field do the Devas know and see? Gotama! As much as an angula's countless parts, upwards as much as the earth of the rayan prabha, upwards as much as the Sai Vimanas, sideways as much as countless days and oceans. Thus, the blue, black, and white leshyas are in the bhavanavantara.

[111 Gautam! As long as they experience pleasure through pleasing sounds and pleasing touches, they wander. This statement should be understood by the Veiyaka-devas. The Anuttaroppapatik-devas experience the pleasure of the best sounds and the best touches. Bhagavan! What is the power of the Saudharma-Isana devas? Gautam! They are endowed with great power, great radiance, and great influence.  /  Up to the Achyuta-vimana, it should be said that all the devas in the Graiveyaka-vimanas and the Anuttar-vimanas are endowed with great power, great radiance, and great influence.

Gotama! They are adorned in two ways, namely, those with Vaikriya-bodies and those with Avaikriya-bodies.  /  Among them, those with Vaikriya-bodies are adorned with garlands, etc., as if they were shining in all ten directions, illuminating, etc., and are beautiful.  /  Among them, those with Avaikriya-bodies are adorned with natural ornaments, without ornaments and clothes.  /  Bhagavan!

Gotama! They experience pleasing sounds, pleasing forms, etc., up to pleasing touches.  /  And so on, up to the Graiveyaka-devas.  /  The Anuttar-devas experience the best sounds, etc., up to the best touches.  /  It should be understood that they are always in this state.  /  They wander, and it should be said that they go wherever they want.  /  204.

## 112] The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra are as graceful as the moon, with foreheads like the crescent moon. They are the very embodiment of adornment and wear beautiful garments. They are beautiful to behold, bring joy, and are symbols of beauty. Those with unblemished bodies possess natural beauty without adornments or clothing. Except for the Saudharma-Ishana Kalpa, the remaining Kalpas have only Devas, no Devis. Therefore, the description of the Devas' adornment up to the Achyuta Kalpa should be done according to the aforementioned method. 

What is the adornment of the Praveya Devas? In response to this question, it is said, "Gautama! Those Devas are devoid of adornments and clothing, they are endowed with natural adornment. There are no Devis there." Similarly, the description of the adornment of the Anuttara-Vimana Devas should also be stated. 

"Bhagavan! How do the Devas in the Saudharma-Ishana Kalpa experience sensual pleasures while moving about?" 

"Gautama! They experience pleasure arising from desirable words, desirable forms, and desirable touch." 

This should be stated in the same way for the Praveya Devas. The Devas of the Anuttara-Vimana experience pleasure arising from Anuttara words and Anuttara touch. The state of all Vaimanika Devas should be described, and it should be stated where they are born after being liberated from the Deva-Bhava, this is called the Udvartana-Dwar. 

The discussion in the aforementioned Sutra only mentions the state and Udvartana. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify it briefly here. The state is as follows:

**Kalpa** | **Name** | **Lowest State** | **Highest State**
------- | -------- | -------- | --------
Saudharma Kalpa | Ishana Kalpa | 1 Palya-Upam | 1 Palya-Upam +

Because Tejaskaaya is not possible there. 

Page #625:
---------------------------
[114] "Gautama, the [jiva-jiva-abhigamsutra] has been produced many times or an infinite number of times. In the remaining kalpas, it should be said in the same way, but it should not be said that they are born as goddesses (because there are no goddesses in the planes before Saudharma-Ishana). It should be said up to the Graveyaka planes. In the Anuttaroppapatik planes, it should be said as before, but not in the form of gods and goddesses. Here the statement of the gods is complete.

Discussion: Here the question has been asked that in each of the thirty-two lakh planes of the Saudharma Devaloka, have all beings, ghosts, jivas and satvas been born before in the form of earth, gods, goddesses and bhandopkaran? (The two-sensed, three-sensed and four-sensed have been included in the pranas, the plants in the bhutas, the five-sensed in the jivas and the rest, earth-up-tejas-vayu, have been included in the satvas). In answer, it has been said that they have been born many times or an infinite number of times. Under the practical amount, jivas have been born an infinite number of times in almost all places.

Here, in many copies, the text "Pudhvikayattae Jav Vanassa Ikaiyattae" is available. But according to the Vrittikara, this is not consistent. Because there is a lack of tejas there. According to the Vrittikara, only "Prithvikaiyataya Devataya Devitaya" is the appropriate mention. Asana, shayan, yavat bhandopkaran, etc. are included in the prithvikaayik jivas. There are goddesses only up to the Saudharma-Ishana kalpa, therefore, it should not be said that they are born in the form of goddesses in the later planes. The prohibition of being born in the form of goddesses has been made up to the Veyaka planes. In the Anuttaravimanas, both the form of goddesses and the form of gods are prohibited. There are no goddesses there. The prohibition of gods has been made because in the four planes of Vijaya, etc., a jiva can go only twice due to progress, and only once in the Sarvarthasiddha plane, not an infinite number of times. The prohibition should be understood from the point of view of not going an infinite number of times. Here the description of the gods ends.

Generally, the description of bhavashthiti, etc. is as follows:

206. "Neraiyanam Bhanta! Kevaiyan Kalam Thiti Pannaata? Goyama! Jahannean Dasavasasahasai Ukkosenam Teettisam Sagarovamai, Evam Samvesi Puchcha.

Generally, the description of the state of existence, etc. [115 AS] "Thus, Venerable Sir! How many times are the Niryayikas, humans, and Devas, less, more, equal, or superior to each other? Gautama! Humans are the least, Niryayikas are countless times more than them, Devas are countless times more than Niryayikas, and Tiryanchas are infinite times more than Devas. Thus, the description of the four types of Samsara-ending beings is complete. 206. Venerable Sir! What is the state of the Niryayikas? Gautama! The lowest is ten thousand years and the highest is thirty-three Sagaropama. In this way, one should ask questions about everyone. / The lowest state of the Tiryanchas is Antarmuhurta and the highest is three Palyopama. The same applies to humans. The state of the Devas should be known to be the same as that of the Niryayikas. The state of the Devas and Niryayikas is their Sanchittana, i.e., Kayasthiti. / (The same, the same Bhava, the time of birth is called Kayasthiti. /) The Kayasthiti of the Tiryanchas is the lowest Antarmuhurta and the highest is Vanaspatikala. Venerable Sir! How long can a human remain as a human? Gautama! The lowest is Antarmuhurta and the highest is three Palyopama plus Purvakotiprithaktva. The difference between Niryayikas, humans, and Devas is the lowest Antarmuhurta and the highest is Vanaspatikala. The difference between the Tiryanchas is the lowest Antarmuhurta and the highest is two hundred to nine hundred Sagaropama. Venerable Sir! Among these Niryayikas and Devas, who is less, more, equal, or superior to whom? Gautama! Humans are the least, Niryayikas are countless times more than them, Devas are countless times more than Niryayikas, and Tiryanchas are infinite times more than Devas. Thus, the description of the four types of Samsara-ending beings is complete. Discussion - After the description of the Devas, the state, Sanchittana (Kayasthiti), difference, and less-moreness of Niryayikas, Tiryanchas, humans, and Devas are collectively mentioned in this Sutra. / The lowest state of the Niryayikas is ten thousand years and the highest is thirty-three Sagaropama. / The lowest state should be understood in relation to the first stone of the Ratnaprabha Naraka and the highest state should be understood in relation to the seventh Naraka-Prithvi. / The lowest state of the Tiryanchas is Antarmuhurta and the highest is three Palyopama. This is in relation to Devakuru, etc. Humans also have the lowest Antarmuhurta and the highest three Palyopama state. The Devas are said to have the lowest ten thousand years - Bhavanapati and Vyantara Devas and the highest thirty-three Sagaropama - Vijaya, etc. Vimanas. / This is the state of existence. / The meaning of Sanchittana is Kayasthiti. / That is, how long a being can remain in the same Bhava. / The state of existence of the Niryayikas and Devas is their Kayasthiti. / Because it is a rule that a Deva does not become a Deva in the next Bhava after death, nor does a Niryayika become a Niryayika in the next Bhava after death.

[116] The term "Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra" is used because the state of existence of gods and hell beings is the same as the "Sanchittana" (state of body) of the "Tiryanch" (non-human beings) for a very short period of time, because after death they can be born as humans or other beings. Their "Sanchittana" from the highest state is for an infinite period of time, because birth and death can occur in plants for an infinite period of time. The meaning of "infinite time" here is the "Vanaspatikala" (plant time). The proof of "Vanaspatikala" is as follows: from time, infinite "Utsapini" (ascending) and "Pravasapini" (descending) are proof, from space, infinite "Lokas" (worlds) and countless "Pudgal Paravart" (transformation of matter) are proof. These "Pudgal Paravart" should be understood as the number of time units in the countless parts of the "Avalika" (covering). The "Sanchittana" of a human being is from the lowest state to a very short period of time. After death, they can be born as "Tiryanch" or other beings. The "Sanchittana" from the highest state is more than three "Palya" (moments). It should be understood in relation to the seven human births (of the "Purvakoti Prayu") in "Mahavideha" (great body) etc., and the eighth birth in "Devakuru" (heavenly beings) etc. "Antar-Dwar" (interval) is the time period after which a being dies in one state and is reborn in the same state. The "Antar" of a "Naireyik" (hell being) is from a very short period of time to "Vanaspatikala". It is in relation to the expectation of being born as a "Tiryanch" or human being for a very short period of time after leaving hell and then becoming a hell being again. A being is born as a human being from the womb, is complete in all "Paryapti" (perfections), is endowed with special knowledge, is "Vaikriya-Labdhiman" (possessor of the power of transformation), desires a kingdom etc., knows the trouble of "Parachari" (enemy), and with the power of his strength, defeats the four-armed army, engages in battle, meditates on "Maharoudra-Dhyana" (meditation on the great wrath), and dies in the womb and is born in hell. In this expectation, the "Naireyik" being is born again in hell after a very short period of time in the human state. After leaving hell, it is born as a "Tandula-Matsya" (fish that eats rice), becomes a "Maharoudra-Dhyana" meditator, lives for a very short period of time, and is born again in hell. In this expectation, the lowest "Antar" of being born as a "Tiryanch" and then being born again in hell should be understood as a very short period of time. The highest "Antar" occurs when it is born in hell after an infinite period of birth and death in plants. The lowest "Antar" of "Tiryanch" is a very short period of time. It is in relation to the expectation of a "Tiryanch" dying and being born as a human being for a very short period of time and then being born again as a "Tiryanch". The highest "Antar" is slightly more than "Sagaropama-Shat-Prithaktva" (hundred times the size of the ocean). It occurs when it continuously wanders in the states of gods, hell beings, and humans for two hundred to nine hundred times the size of the ocean. The lowest "Antar" of a human being is a very short period of time, and the highest "Antar" is "Vanaspatikala". The lowest "Antar" occurs when it leaves the human state and lives in the "Tiryanch" state for a very short period of time and then becomes a human being again. The highest "Antar" is "Vanaspatikala", which is clear. The lowest "Antar" of gods is a very short period of time. A being leaves the state of gods and is born as a human being from the womb, is complete in all "Paryapti", is endowed with special knowledge, and while listening to the religious teachings of "Shraman" (Jain monk) or "Shramanopasak" (follower of a Jain monk), meditates on "Dharma-Dhyana" (meditation on religion), and is born in the state of gods while still in the womb. In this expectation, the lowest "Antar" occurs for a very short period of time. The highest "Antar" is "Vanaspatikala".

Generally, the description of the state of existence, etc. [117], which occurs when one becomes a deva after taking birth and death in the plant kingdom for an infinite period of time. The **alpabahutva** in the **alpabahutva** context refers to the fewest number of humans. Because they are equal to the number of **akashapradeshas** in the **asanख्येयभागवर्ती** regions of the **shreni**. They are **nairyika** by **asanख्येयguna**, because they are equal to the number of **akashapradeshas** in the **shreni** that are equal to the number of **pradeshas** obtained by multiplying the first square root of the number of **pradeshas** in a region the size of an **angulamaatra** by the second square root. The **devas** are **asanख्येयguna** more than the **nairyikas**, because the **vyantar** and **jyotishka devas** in the **mahadaṇḍaka** are said to be **asanख्यatguna** more than the **narakas**. The **tiryach** are **anantaguna** more than the **devas**, because the **vanaspati** beings are said to be **anantaanant**. Thus, the statement of the attainment of the four types of **samsarasamaapannaka** beings is complete. // The third attainment is complete. //

**207.  The Fourth Pratyapatti with Five Titharas**

Those who teach that there are five types of *samsara* -bound beings, describe them as follows: *Ekeindriya*, *Dveindriya*, *Treindriya*, *Chaturindriya*, and *Panchendriya*.

**O Bhagavan!** How many types of *Ekeindriya* beings are there?

**Gautama:** *Ekeindriya* beings are of two types: *Parjatta* (sufficient) and *Aparjatta* (insufficient).

**Similarly**, all the way to *Panchendriya*, there are two types: *Parjatta* and *Aparjatta*.

**O Bhagavan!** What is the duration of the *Ekeindriya* being's existence?

**Gautama:** The duration of the *Ekeindriya* being's existence is from the *jghanya* (lowest) *antarmuhurta* (a very short period of time) to the *utkrista* (highest) twenty-two thousand years.

**Similarly**, the duration of the *Dveindriya* being's existence is from the *jghanya* *antarmuhurta* to the *utkrista* twelve years. The duration of the *Treindriya* being's existence is forty-nine nights and days. The duration of the *Chaturindriya* being's existence is six months. The duration of the *Panchendriya* being's existence is from the *jghanya* *antarmuhurta* to the *utkrista* thirty-three *sagaropama* (a vast period of time).

**O Bhagavan!** What is the duration of the *Aparjatta* *Ekeindriya* being's existence?

**Gautama:** The duration of the *Aparjatta* *Ekeindriya* being's existence is from the *jghanya* *antarmuhurta* to the *utkrista* *antarmuhurta*.

**Similarly**, the duration of all the *Aparjatta* beings should be described.

**O Bhagavan!** What is the duration of the *Parjatta* *Ekeindriya* to the *Parjatta* *Panchendriya* beings?

**Gautama:** The duration of the *Parjatta* *Ekeindriya* to the *Parjatta* *Panchendriya* beings is from the *jghanya* *antarmuhurta* to the *utkrista* twenty-two thousand years minus one *antarmuhurta*.

**Similarly**, the duration of all the *Parjatta* beings should be described as their total duration minus one *antarmuhurta*.

**The Fivefold Classification and the Fourfold Attainment**

**[119 208.  **

**"O Bhagavan! How long does an *ekaindriya* (one-sensed being) remain in its form?"**

**"Gautama! It remains from the lowest *antarmūhurta* (a very short period of time) to the highest *vanaspatikāla* (the time it takes for a plant to grow)."**

**"O Bhagavan! How long does a *dvaindriya* (two-sensed being) remain in its form?"**

**"Gautama! It remains from the lowest *antarmūhurta* to the highest *saṅkhyātakāla* (a period of time that can be counted), and so does a *caturaindriya* (four-sensed being)."**

**"O Bhagavan! How long does a *pañcendriya* (five-sensed being) remain in its form?"**

**"Gautama! It remains from the lowest *antarmūhurta* to the highest *sāgaropamasahasra* (a thousand *sāgaropamas*, a period of time equal to the time it takes for a drop of water to evaporate from the ocean) plus a little more."**

**"O Bhagavan! How long does an *aparyāpta ekaindriya* (an incomplete one-sensed being) remain in its form?"**

**"Gautama! It remains from the lowest *antarmūhurta* to the highest *antarmūhurta*, and so does an *aparyāpta pañcendriya* (an incomplete five-sensed being)."**

**"O Bhagavan! How long does a *paryāpta ekaindriya* (a complete one-sensed being) remain in its form?"**

**"Gautama! It remains from the lowest *antarmūhurta* to the highest *saṅkhyāta vāssahasra* (a thousand years that can be counted)."**

**"And so does a *dvaindriya* (two-sensed being), except that here we should say *saṅkhyāta vāssa* (counted years)."**

**"O Bhagavan! How long does a *triindriya* (three-sensed being) remain in its form?"**

**"It remains for a *saṅkhyāta rātri-dina* (a counted number of nights and days)."**

**"O Bhagavan! How long does a *caturaindriya* (four-sensed being) remain in its form?"**

**"It remains for a *saṅkhyāta māsa* (a counted number of months)."**

**"O Bhagavan! How long does a *paryāpta pañcendriya* (a complete five-sensed being) remain in its form?"**

**"It remains for a *sāgaropamasahasra* (a thousand *sāgaropamas*) plus a little more."**

**"O Bhagavan! What is the difference in time between an *ekaindriya* (one-sensed being) and a *dvaindriya* (two-sensed being)?"**

**"Gautama! The difference is from the lowest *antarmūhurta* to the highest two thousand *sāgaropamas* plus a counted number of years."**

**"O Bhagavan! What is the difference in time between a *dvaindriya* (two-sensed being) and a *triindriya* (three-sensed being)?"**

**"Gautama! The difference is from the lowest *antarmūhurta* to the highest *vanaspatikāla* (the time it takes for a plant to grow)."**

**"And so it is for the difference between a *triindriya* (three-sensed being) and a *caturaindriya* (four-sensed being), and between a *caturaindriya* (four-sensed being) and a *pañcendriya* (five-sensed being)."**

**"And so it is for the difference between an *aparyāpta* (incomplete) and a *paryāpta* (complete) being."**

## 120] [Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra, Gautama! The shortest duration of existence is an antarmuhurta, and the longest is a vanaspatikala. Similarly, the difference between the Shreendriya, Chaturindriya, and Panchendriya, as well as the Apariapt and Pariyaapt, should be explained in the same way. The Sutra regarding the state of existence is clear. The clarity regarding the state of existence and the interval between births is as follows: The state of existence of an Ekendriya is the shortest antarmuhurta. After death, it can be reborn as a Dwindriya, etc. The longest duration of existence is ananantakala, which is the same as vanaspatikala. Since a vanaspati is an Ekendriya, it is also included in the Ekendriya category. In the Dwindriya, Triindriya, and Chaturindriya Sutras, the longest duration of existence is a Sankhyeya-thousand years, because it is said, "Vigali Diyanam VasasahasasanKhyejja." In the Panchendriya Sutra, the duration of existence is slightly more than a thousand sagaropama. A being can remain in the Panchendriya form for this long in the Nairyaik, Tiryanch, Manushya, and Deva bhava. In the Ekendriya, etc., Apariapt Sutras, the shortest and longest duration of existence is an antarmuhurta, because the duration of Apariaptalabdhi is only this much. In the Ekendriya-Pariyaapt Sutra, the longest duration of existence is a Sankhyeya-thousand years. In Ekendriya, the longest duration of existence for a Prithvikaaya is twenty-two thousand years, for an Apkaaya is seven thousand years, for a Tejaskaaya is three aharatra, for a Vayukaaya is three thousand years, and for a Vanaspatikaaya is ten thousand years. Therefore, by continuously adding several Pariyaapt bhava, a Sankhyeya-thousand years is achieved. In Dwindriya-Pariyaapt, the longest duration of existence is a Sankhyeya year. Because the longest duration of existence for a Dwindriya is twelve years. The longest duration of existence does not occur in all bhava. Therefore, by continuously adding several Pariyaapt bhava, a Sankhyeya year is achieved, not a hundred years or a thousand years. In Triindriya-Pariyaapt Sutra, the duration of existence is a Sankhyeya aharatra, because their longest duration of existence is forty-five days. By continuously adding several Pariyaapt bhava, a Sankhyeya aharatra is achieved. In Chaturindriya-Pariyaapt Sutra, the longest duration of existence is a Sankhyeya month, because their longest duration of existence is six months. Therefore, by continuously adding several Pariyaapt bhava, a Sankhyeya month is achieved. In Panchendriya-Pariyaapt Sutra, the duration of existence is a Satirrek Sagaropama Shataprithaktva. A being can remain in the Panchendriya-Pariyaapt form for this long in the Nairyaik, Tiryanch, Manushya, and Deva bhava. The interval between births for Ekendriya is the shortest antarmuhurta. It is expected that an Ekendriya will be reborn as a Dwindriya, etc., after spending an antarmuhurta in the interval between births. The longest interval is a Sankhyeya year plus two thousand Sagaropama. The duration of existence for an Ekendriya is the same as the duration of existence for a Sakaya. The duration of existence for a Traskaaya is said to be a Sankhyeya year plus two thousand Sagaropama. 1. "Taskaiyae Nan Bante! Taskaaeti Kalamo Kevacchiran Hoee? Goyama! Jahanne Nan Antomuhutta Ukkosena Do Sagarovama Sahasssai Sankhyejjava Samabhahiyaa."

[Fourth Pratyapatti of the Fivefold Path] [121] In the Dwīndriya, Trīndriya, Chaturindriya and Panchendriya sūtras, the least is the Antarmūhūrta and the most excellent is the Sarvatra Vanaspatikāla. It should be understood that which emerges from Dwīndriya and after staying in the Vanaspati for an infinite time, then again arises in Dwīndriya etc. Just as five औधिक sūtras are said to be related to the internal, in the same way, they should also be said in the context of the sufficient and insufficient.  

**Alpabahutva Dwār 209.** 

Thus, O Bhagavan! In these Ekendriya, Dwīndriya, Trīndriya, Chaturindriya and Panchendriya, who is less, who is more, who is equal, and who is superior? 

Gautama! The least are the Panchendriya, the Chaturindriya are superior to them, the Trīndriya are superior to them, the Dwīndriya are superior to them, and the Ekendriya are infinitely superior. 

Thus, in the context of the insufficient, the Panchendriya are insufficient, the Chaturindriya are insufficient and superior, the Trīndriya are insufficient and superior, the Dwīndriya are insufficient and superior, the Ekendriya are insufficient and infinitely superior, and the Saindriya are insufficient and superior. 

Thus, in the context of the sufficient, the Chaturindriya are sufficient, the Panchendriya are sufficient and superior, the Dwīndriya are sufficient and superior, the Trīndriya are sufficient and superior, the Ekendriya are sufficient and infinitely superior, and the Saindriya are sufficient and superior. 

Thus, O Bhagavan! In these Saindriya, who is sufficient and insufficient, who is less, who is more, who is equal, and who is superior? 

Gautama! The Saindriya are insufficient in all cases, and the Saindriya are sufficient and countless times superior. 

Thus, in the Ekendriya... 

Thus, O Bhagavan! In these Dwīndriya, who is sufficient and insufficient, who is less, who is more, who is equal, and who is superior? 

Gautama! The Dwīndriya are sufficient and insufficient, and countless times superior in all cases. 

Thus, in the Trīndriya, Chaturindriya, and Panchendriya... 

Thus, O Bhagavan! In these Ekendriya, Dwīndriya, Trīndriya, Chaturindriya, and Panchendriya, who is sufficient and insufficient, who is less, who is more, who is equal, and who is superior? 

Gautama! The Chaturindriya are sufficient in all cases, the Panchendriya are sufficient and superior, the Dwīndriya are sufficient and superior, the Trīndriya are sufficient and superior, the Panchendriya are insufficient and countless times superior, the Chaturindriya are insufficient and superior, the Trīndriya are insufficient and superior, the Dwīndriya are insufficient and superior, the Ekendriya are insufficient and infinitely superior, the Saindriya are insufficient and superior, the Ekendriya are sufficient and countless times superior, the Saindriya are sufficient and superior, and the Saindriya are superior. 

This is the fivefold path, the summary of the world, the living beings.

## 122]  The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra:

**In the same way, among the one-sensed, etc., insufficient beings, the five-sensed insufficient beings are the fewest, the four-sensed insufficient beings are more numerous than them, the three-sensed insufficient beings are more numerous than them, the two-sensed insufficient beings are more numerous than them, and the one-sensed insufficient beings are infinitely more numerous than them. The many-sensed insufficient beings are more numerous than them.**

**In the same way, among the one-sensed, etc., sufficient beings, the four-sensed sufficient beings are the fewest, the five-sensed sufficient beings are more numerous than them, the two-sensed sufficient beings are more numerous than them, the three-sensed sufficient beings are more numerous than them, and the one-sensed sufficient beings are infinitely more numerous than them. The many-sensed sufficient beings are more numerous than them.**

**O Bhagavan! Among these many-sensed sufficient and insufficient beings, who is less, more, equal, or more numerous than whom?**

**Gautama! The many-sensed insufficient beings are countable times more numerous than the many-sensed sufficient beings. In the same way, one should know the less and more numerous among the one-sensed sufficient and insufficient beings.**

**O Bhagavan! Among these two-sensed sufficient and insufficient beings, who is less or more numerous than whom?**

**Gautama! The two-sensed sufficient beings are countless times more numerous than the two-sensed insufficient beings. In the same way, one should know the less and more numerous among the three-sensed, four-sensed, and five-sensed beings.**

**O Bhagavan! Among these one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, and five-sensed sufficient and insufficient beings, who is less, more, equal, or more numerous than whom?**

**Gautama! The four-sensed sufficient beings are the fewest, the five-sensed sufficient beings are more numerous than them, the two-sensed sufficient beings are more numerous than them, the three-sensed sufficient beings are more numerous than them, the five-sensed insufficient beings are countless times more numerous than them, the four-sensed insufficient beings are more numerous than them, the three-sensed insufficient beings are more numerous than them, the two-sensed insufficient beings are more numerous than them, the one-sensed insufficient beings are infinitely more numerous than them, the many-sensed insufficient beings are more numerous than them, the one-sensed sufficient beings are countable times more numerous than them, the many-sensed sufficient beings are more numerous than them, and the many-sensed beings are more numerous than them.**

**In this way, the description of the five types of beings who have attained liberation from the cycle of birth and death is complete.**

**Explanation:**

**(1) First, the less and more numerous among the one-sensed, etc., up to the five-sensed beings are described in general. The five-sensed beings are the fewest, because they are as numerous as the countless categories of beings that exist in the countless parts of the countless yojana-koti-koti-sized universes.**

**(2) The less and more numerous among the insufficient beings are described as follows: The five-sensed insufficient beings are the fewest, because they are as numerous as the countless parts of an angula (finger-width) in one pratar (a unit of time). The four-sensed insufficient beings are more numerous than them, because they are as numerous as the countless parts of an angula in a pratar. The three-sensed insufficient beings are more numerous than them, because they are as numerous as the countless parts of an angula in a pratar.**

## Fourth Stage of Liberation: Five Types of Liberated Souls

**123. The fourth stage of liberation is characterized by five types of liberated souls.**

**1. Abundance of One-Sensed Liberated Souls:** These are countless, exceeding the number of finger-breadth segments. They are infinitely more numerous than the other types of liberated souls because the number of liberated souls in the plant kingdom is infinite.

**2. Relative Scarcity of Multi-Sensed Liberated Souls:** The least numerous are the four-sensed liberated souls. This is because four-sensed beings have short lifespans and do not exist for long periods. Therefore, they are few in number at the time of liberation. Even though they are few, they are still as numerous as the finger-breadth segments. The two-sensed liberated souls are more numerous than the four-sensed, exceeding the number of finger-breadth segments. The three-sensed liberated souls are even more numerous, exceeding the number of finger-breadth segments by nature. The one-sensed liberated souls are infinitely more numerous than the three-sensed because the number of liberated souls in the plant kingdom is infinite.

**3. Relative Scarcity of Liberated Souls within the Non-Liberated:** The least numerous are the one-sensed non-liberated souls. The liberated souls are countless times more numerous than the non-liberated. Among the one-sensed beings, the subtle beings are numerous because they are omnipresent. Among the subtle beings, the non-liberated are few, and the liberated are countless times more numerous. In the two-sensed beings, the two-sensed liberated souls are the least numerous, as they are equal to the number of finger-breadth segments. The non-liberated are countless times more numerous, as they are equal to the number of finger-breadth segments. Similarly, the relative scarcity of liberated and non-liberated souls should be understood in the three-sensed, four-sensed, and five-sensed beings.

**4. Combined Relative Scarcity of Liberated and Non-Liberated Souls:** This should be understood based on the third and second relative scarcity mentioned earlier. The original text clearly explains this in detail.

**5. Conclusion:** This completes the fourth stage of liberation, which describes the five types of liberated souls.

210. The Acharya who states that there are six types of beings who end their cycle of rebirth, says: 1. Earth-bodied, 2. Water-bodied, 3. Fire-bodied, 4. Air-bodied, 5. Plant-bodied, and 6.  Triple-bodied. /  Lord! What is the nature of the Earth-bodied?  Gautama! Earth-bodied beings are of two types: Subtle-earth-bodied and Coarse-earth-bodied. /  Subtle-earth-bodied beings are of two types: Sufficient and Insufficient. /  Similarly, Coarse-earth-bodied beings are also of two types: Sufficient and Insufficient.  In the same way, there are four types each of Water-bodied, Fire-bodied, Air-bodied, and Plant-bodied. /  Lord! What is the nature of the Triple-bodied?  Gautama! Triple-bodied beings are of two types: Sufficient and Insufficient. /  211. Lord! How long is the lifespan of an Earth-bodied being?  Gautama! The shortest lifespan is an Antarmukha and the longest is twenty-two thousand years. /  Similarly, the lifespan of all other types of beings should be stated.  The shortest lifespan of a Triple-bodied being is an Antarmukha and the longest is thirty-three Sagaropama. /  The lifespan of all Insufficient beings is an Antarmukha, both the shortest and the longest. /  The lifespan of all Sufficient beings should be stated as the total lifespan minus an Antarmukha. /  212. Lord! How long is the time period for an Earth-bodied being to become an Earth-bodied being again?  Gautama! The shortest time period is an Antarmukha and the longest is an immeasurable period of time, as long as immeasurable worlds. /  Similarly, the time period for Water-bodied, Fire-bodied, and Air-bodied beings, and Plant-bodied beings is an infinite period of time, as long as an immeasurable portion of the Avaliya. 

Page #636:
---------------------------
"O Venerable One! How long does the existence of a *Trasakaya* last? Gautama! The minimum duration is an *Antomuhurta* and the maximum is countless *Kalpas* equal to countless *Lokapramanas* of *Akashakhandas* devoid of dust. Similarly, the duration of the existence of an *Apakaya*, *Tejaskaya*, and *Vayukaya* should be known. The duration of the existence of a *Vanaspatikaya* is infinite, equal to the number of *Kalpas* in a countless part of a *Pravalika*. The duration of the existence of an *Asakaya* is a minimum of an *Antomuhurta* and a maximum of countless years plus two thousand *Sagaropama*. The duration of the existence of all six *Aparjatta* is a minimum of an *Antomuhurta* and a maximum of an *Antomuhurta*. The maximum duration of the existence of an *Aparjatta* *Prithvikaya* is countless thousands of years. This is also the maximum duration of the existence of an *Aparjatta* *Apakaya*, *Vayukaya*, and *Vanaspatikaya*. The maximum duration of the existence of a *Parjatta* *Tejaskaya* is countless days and nights. The maximum duration of the existence of a *Parjatta* *Trasakaya* is countless *Sagaropama* multiplied by a hundred.

O Venerable One! What is the interval between the existence of a *Prithvikaya*? Gautama! The minimum interval is an *Antomuhurta* and the maximum is a *Vanaspatikala*. Similarly, the interval between the existence of an *Apakaya*, *Tejaskaya*, and *Vayukaya* is a *Vanaspatikala*. The interval between the existence of an *Asakaya* is also a *Vanaspatikala*. The interval between the existence of a *Vanaspatikaya* is equal to the duration of the existence of a *Prithvikaya* (countless *Kalpas*). Similarly, the interval between the existence of an *Aparjatta* is a *Vanaspatikala*. The interval between the existence of an *Aparjatta* *Vanaspati* is a *Prithvikalpa*. The interval between the existence of a *Parjatta* is a *Vanaspatikala*. The interval between the existence of a *Parjatta* *Vanaspati* is a *Prithvikalpa*."

---------------------------
126) The explanation of the state of being and the difference between them, as presented in the form of questions and answers in the Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra, is established by the text. Only the explanation of the countless and infinite time found in it is necessary. / The countless time is described in two ways - by time and by space. / The countless ascending and descending periods of time are called countless time. / The countless space-based countless time is the time taken for the countless space-regions to become empty when one region is removed from each of the countless space-regions at every moment. Infinite time is also described in terms of time and space. The infinite time is the time of the infinite ascending and descending periods. / This is from the perspective of time-measurement. From the perspective of space-measurement, infinite time is the time taken for the infinite-infinite space-regions to become empty when one region is removed from each of them at every moment. This infinite time, when described by the movement of matter, is the countless matter-movement-shaped time. The number of these matter-movements is equal to the number of moments in the countless parts of the pravalika. The term "vegetative time" mentioned in the text refers to infinite time, and the term "earth-body" refers to countless time. / 213. The least numerous are the sakayikas, then the tejaskaayikas are countless times more numerous, then the prithvikaayikas are more numerous, then the apkaayikas are more numerous, then the vayukaayikas are more numerous, and then the vanaspatikaayikas are infinitely numerous. /

## Sixfold Classification of the Fifth Understanding

**[127] The scarcity and abundance of the Earth-bodied, etc., is also of the same type. The scarcity and abundance of the sufficient Earth-bodied, etc., is also of the same type. O Bhagavan! Among the sufficient and insufficient Earth-bodied, etc., who is less, more, equal, or superior to whom?**

**Gautama:** The least numerous are the insufficient Earth-bodied, and the sufficient Earth-bodied are countless times more numerous. Similarly, the least numerous are the insufficient Ap-bodied, and the sufficient Ap-bodied are countless times more numerous. In the same way, it should be said up to the Plant-bodied. Among the As-bodied, the least numerous are the sufficient Tris-bodied, and the insufficient Tris-bodied are countless times more numerous.

**O Bhagavan! Among these Earth-bodied, etc., up to the Tris-bodied, who is less, more, equal, or superior to whom in their totality?**

**Gautama:** The least numerous are the sufficient Sak-bodied, and the insufficient Sak-bodied are countless times more numerous. The insufficient Tejas-bodied are countless times more numerous than the insufficient Sak-bodied. The insufficient Earth-bodied, Ap-bodied, and Air-bodied are superior to the insufficient Tejas-bodied. The sufficient Tejas-bodied are countless times more numerous than the insufficient Earth-bodied, Ap-bodied, and Air-bodied. The sufficient Earth-bodied, Ap-bodied, and Air-bodied are superior to the sufficient Tejas-bodied. The insufficient Plant-bodied are infinite times more numerous than the sufficient Earth-bodied, Ap-bodied, and Air-bodied. The sufficient Sak-bodied are superior to the insufficient Plant-bodied. The sufficient Plant-bodied are countless times more numerous than the sufficient Sak-bodied. The sufficient Sak-bodied are superior to the sufficient Plant-bodied.

**Explanation:**

* **First Scarcity and Abundance:** This refers to the general statement of the six bodies. The least numerous are the Tris-bodied, because the Tris-bodied with two senses, etc., are less numerous than the other bodies. The Tejas-bodied are countless times more numerous than the Tris-bodied, because they are as numerous as the countless Lokakasha-regions. The Earth-bodied are superior to the Tejas-bodied, because they are as numerous as the countless Lokakasha-regions. The Ap-bodied are superior to the Earth-bodied, because they are as numerous as the countless Lokakasha-regions. The Air-bodied are superior to the Ap-bodied, because they are as numerous as the countless Lokakasha-regions. The Plant-bodied are infinite times more numerous than the Air-bodied, because they are as numerous as the infinite Lokakasha-regions.
* **Second Scarcity and Abundance:** This refers to the scarcity and abundance of the insufficient bodies. It is in the same order as mentioned above. The scarcity and abundance of the sufficient bodies should also be understood in the same order.
* **Third Scarcity and Abundance:** This refers to the scarcity and abundance of the individual sufficient and insufficient Earth-bodied, etc. The least numerous are the insufficient Earth-bodied, and the sufficient Earth-bodied are countless times more numerous. There are many microscopic beings among the Earth-bodied, because they are present throughout the entire universe. The sufficient Earth-bodied are countless times more numerous than the microscopic beings. Similarly, the principles for the Ap-bodied, Tejas-bodied, Air-bodied, and Plant-bodied should be understood. Among the Tris-bodied, the least numerous are the sufficient Tris-bodied, and the insufficient Tris-bodied are countless times more numerous, because the sufficient Sak-bodied are as numerous as the countable parts of a finger of the Prati-tara.
* **Fourth Scarcity and Abundance:** This refers to the combined scarcity and abundance of the Earth-bodied, etc., in their sufficient and insufficient forms. It is as follows: The least numerous are the sufficient Sak-bodied. The insufficient Tris-bodied are countless times more numerous than the sufficient Sak-bodied, as explained earlier. The insufficient Tejas-bodied are countless times more numerous than the insufficient Tris-bodied, because they are countless...

## 128] The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra Lokakasha-Pradesha are measured in terms of Lokakasha-Pradesha. They are superior to the Earth, Ap, and Vayu in terms of their insufficient order, because they are in the measure of countless Lokakasha-Pradesha-Rashi. / They are superior to the Tejas-Kayika in terms of their sufficient number, because they are in the measure of sufficient number from the insufficient in the subtle. / They are superior to the Earth, Ap, and Vayu in terms of their sufficient Jiva order. They are superior to the Vanaspati-Kayika in terms of their insufficient infinite measure, because they are in the measure of infinite Lokakasha-Pradesha-Rashi. They are superior to the Vanaspati-Kayika in terms of their sufficient number, because they are in the measure of sufficient number from the insufficient in the subtle. / The subtle Jivas are all numerous, compared to them this is a small multitude. 214. Suhumassam, Bante! Kevaiyan Kalam Thii Pannaata? Goyama! Jahannean Antomuhutta, Ukkoseenavi Antomuhutta / Evam Jaav Suhamaniniyassa / Evam Apjattagaanaavi Pajattagaanaavi Jahanneanavi Ukkoseenavi Antomuhutta / / 214. Bhagavan! What is the state of the subtle Jivas? Gautama! From the lowest, it is Antomuhurta, and from the highest, it is also Antomuhurta / In the same way, it should be said up to the Suhamaniniyassa / In the same way, the state of the sufficient and insufficient subtle Jivas, from the lowest and highest, is only Antomuhurta. In the presented Sutra, the state of the subtle and the common is explained. There are two types of subtle Jivas - Nigod-rupa and Anigod-rupa / The state of both, from the lowest and highest, is only Antomuhurta / The highest should be understood as superior to the lowest Antomuhurta, otherwise, there is no meaning in calling it the highest / In this way, six Sutras should be said regarding the subtle Prithvi-Kaya, subtle Ap-Kaya, subtle Tejas-Kaya, subtle Vayu-Kaya, subtle Vanaspati-Kaya, and subtle Nigod. Here, it can be doubted that the subtle Vanaspati is the Nigod itself; its meaning is also understood from the subtle Vanaspati, then why is the Nigod-sutra said separately? The reason is that the subtle Vanaspati is in the form of a Jiva, and the subtle Nigod is in the form of the basic body of infinite Jivas / Therefore, the significance of a different Sutra is there / It has been said - "This entire Lok is filled with subtle Nigods, like a box full of Anjan-churna, from all sides. In this Lok, which is full of Nigods, countless Nigods are called 'Golak' because they are circular and large in measure / The meaning of Nigod is the body of infinite Jivas / There are countless such Golaks, and in each Golak, there are countless Nigods, and in each Nigod, there are infinite Jivas. In one Nigod, the countless part of the infinite Jivas comes out of it every moment, and another countless part is born there. This Udvartana and Utpati continues every moment. Just as this order of Udvartana and Upapat continues in one Nigod, in the same way, this Udvartana and Upapat activity continues every moment in all the Nigods that are spread throughout the Lok. Therefore, the state of all Nigods and Nigod Jivas is said to be only Antomuhurta / Therefore, all Nigods change every moment due to Udvartana and Upapat, in the time of only Antomuhurta, but they do not become zero.

## 134] [Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra (2) The relative scarcity of insufficient badars should be known according to the Prauhik Sutra - for example, the fewest badars are Traskayik insufficient, then the badars are Tejas kayik insufficient in countless numbers, and so on in ascending order. (3) The relative scarcity of sufficient badars - the fewest badars are Tejas kayik sufficient, then the badars are Traskayik sufficient in countless numbers, then the badars are each body Vanaspatikayik sufficient in countless numbers, then the badars are Nigod sufficient in countless numbers, then the badars are Prithvi kayik sufficient in countless numbers, then the badars are Apkayik sufficient in countless numbers, then the badars are Vayukay sufficient in countless numbers, then the badars are Vanaspatikayik sufficient in infinite numbers, then the badars are sufficient in special abundance. (4) The relative scarcity of sufficient and insufficient badars for each (everywhere) there are few sufficient badars and countless insufficient badars, because countless insufficient badars are born in the shelter of one sufficient badar. (The statement of all the sutras is like the Sakayik badars /) (5) The combined relative scarcity, Bhagavan! Among the badars, which badars are less abundant than the Prithvi kayik badars, up to the Sakayik badars, and which are more abundant, and by how much? Gautama! The fewest badars are Tejas kayik sufficient, then the badars are Traskayik sufficient in countless numbers, then the badars are Askayik insufficient in countless numbers, then each body badars are Vanaspatikayik sufficient in countless numbers, then the badars are Nigod sufficient in countless numbers, then the Prithvi-Ap-Vayukay sufficient in countless numbers respectively, then the badars are Tejas kayik insufficient in countless numbers, then each body badars are Vanaspati insufficient in countless numbers, then the badars are Nigod insufficient in countless numbers, then the badars are Prithvi-Ap-Vayukay insufficient in countless numbers, then the badars are Vanaspati sufficient in infinite numbers, then the badars are sufficient in special abundance, then the badars are Vanaspati insufficient in countless numbers, then the badars are insufficient in special abundance, then the badars are sufficient in special abundance. Discussion - First, the relative scarcity of the six bodies has been explained. It is as follows - the fewest badars are Traskayik, because only the two-sense beings etc. are Tras badars, and they are less abundant than the other bodies / Then the badars are Tejas kayik in countless numbers, because they are countless Lokakashapradeshpraman. Then each body badars are Vanaspatikayik in countless numbers, because their locations are countless / ' Badar 1. And it is said in the second place called Prajnapanaya - in the Antomanussakhete, in the two and a half days, in the oceans, in the Nivaghas, in the twenty-two Rasas, in the Karmabhumis, in the Vaghas, in the five Mahavidehas, there the locations of the Bajrateukayikas are established, and wherever the locations of the Bajrateukayikas are established, there the locations of the Apbajjattas are established.

## Sixfold Classification of the Fifth Understanding

**[135]  **Tejaskaayikas are only found in the human realm, while Vanaspatikaayikas are found in all three realms. Therefore, the countless qualities of the human realm are countless times greater than the Tejaskaayikas. From these, the Badar Vanaspatikaayikas are countless times greater, because they are found in all water bodies due to their extremely subtle nature and their prevalence in water. Therefore, they are countless times greater. From the Badar Nigodas, the Badar Prithvikaayikas are countless times greater, because they are found in all eight earths, all Vimanas, all Bhavanas, and in mountains, etc. From these, the Badar Apkaayikas are countless times greater, because there is an abundance of water in the oceans. From these, the Badar Vayukaayikas are countless times greater, because air is possible even in the poles. From these, the Badar Vanaspatikaayikas are infinite times greater, because there are infinite beings in each Badar Nigoda. From these, the general Badars are more special, because they include the Badar Traskaayikas, etc.

**(2)** The second type of scarcity is related to the insufficient number of these six categories. The fewest are the Badar Traskaayikas (the reasoning has been explained earlier). From these, the Badar Tejaskaayikas are countless times greater, because they are as numerous as the countless Lokakasha. In this way, one should understand the scarcity from the previous explanation.

**(3)** The third type of scarcity is related to the sufficient number of these six categories. The fewest are the Badar Tejaskaayikas, because they are equal to the number of times obtained by multiplying the square of the time of the Pravalika by the time of the Pavalika, minus a certain amount of time. From these, the Badar Askaayikas are countless times greater, because they are equal to the number of parts of an angula in the Pratar. From these, each individual Vanaspatikaayika is countless times greater, because they are equal to the number of parts of an angula in the Pratar. From these, the Badar Nigodas are countless times greater, because they are extremely subtle and found everywhere in water bodies. From these, the Badar Prithvikaayikas are countless times greater, because they are as numerous as the countless parts of an angula in the Pratar. From these, the Badar Apkaayikas are countless times greater, because they are as numerous as the countless parts of an angula in the Pratar. From these, the Badar Vayukaayikas are countless times greater, because they are equal to the number of sky regions in the Dhanikrita Lok, which are equal to the number of parts of the countless Pratars. From these, the Badar Vanaspatikaayikas are infinite times greater, because there are infinite beings in each Badar Nigoda. From these, the general Badars are more special, because they include all the sufficient categories, including the Badar Tejaskaayikas, etc.

**(4)** The fourth type of scarcity is related to the sufficient and insufficient number of each category. It should be said that the insufficient number is countless times greater than the sufficient number. From the Badar Prithvikaayikas to the Badar Traskaayikas, everywhere...

[136] The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra has countless more insufficient than sufficient, because countless insufficient Badar are born in the shadow of one sufficient Badar. (5) The fifth Alpabahutva is a combined statement of the sufficient and insufficient of the six Kayas. / It is as follows: the fewest Badar Tejaskaayik sufficient, countless times more Badar Traskaayik sufficient than them, countless times more Badar Vanaspatikaayik sufficient than them, countless times more Badar Nigod sufficient than them, countless times more Badar Prithvikaayik sufficient than them, countless times more Badar Apkaayik sufficient than them, countless times more Badar Vayukaayik sufficient than them. / (The logic of the above terms should be known as before.) _ There are countless times more Badar Tejaskaayik insufficient than them, because Badar Vayukaayik sufficient are equal to the regions of light in countless Lokakashapradesha, but Badar Tejaskaayik insufficient are equal to countless Lokakashapradesha. Because there are countless distinctions of the countless, one should know that this countless is countless times more than the previous countless. From Badar Tejaskaayik insufficient, each Badar Vanaspatikaayik, Badar Nigod, Badar Prithvikaayik, Badar Apkaayik, Badar Vayukaayik insufficient should be said to be countless times more. / There are infinitely more Badar Vanaspatikaayik sufficient than Badar Vayukaayik insufficient, because there are infinite Jivas in each Badar Nigod. They are more special than the general Badar sufficient, because the Badar Tejaskaayik etc. sufficient are projected into them. / There are countless times more Badar Vanaspatikaayik insufficient than them, because countless insufficient Badar Vanaspatikaayik Nigod are born in the shadow of each sufficient Badar Vanaspatikaayik Nigod. They are more special than the general Badar insufficient, because the Badar Tejaskaayik etc. insufficient are projected into them. They are more special than the general Badar without the sufficient-insufficient distinction, because all Badar sufficient-insufficient are included in them. Thus, five Alpabahutva have been said with regard to Badar. / The combined Alpabahutva of the subtle Badar is 221 (a) (1) ASi Naṁ Bhanta!

[135] The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra has infinite qualities in the gross, then there are many more in the subtle, then there are innumerable qualities in the subtle plant-like bodies, then there are many more in the (general) subtle. (2) The second alpabahutva is about the insufficient of these. It is as follows: the least are the gross Traskaayik insufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the gross Tejaskaayik insufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the gross Vanaspatikaayik insufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the gross Nigod insufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the gross Prithvikaayik insufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the gross Apkaayik insufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the gross Vaayukaayik insufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the subtle Tejaskaayik insufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the subtle Prithvikaayik insufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the subtle Apkaayik insufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the subtle Vaayukaayik insufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the subtle Nigod insufficient, then there are infinite qualities of the gross Vanaspatikaayik insufficient, then there are many more of the general gross insufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the subtle Vanaspatikaayik insufficient, then there are many more of the general subtle insufficient. (3) The third alpabahutva is about the sufficient of these. It is as follows: the least are the gross Tejaskaayik sufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the gross Traskaayik sufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the gross Vanaspatikaayik sufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the gross Nigod sufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the gross Prithvikaayik sufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the gross Apkaayik sufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the gross Vaayukaayik sufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the subtle Tejaskaayik sufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the subtle Prithvikaayik sufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the subtle Apkaayik sufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the subtle Vaayukaayik sufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the subtle Nigod sufficient, then there are infinite qualities of the gross Vanaspatikaayik sufficient, then there are many more of the general gross sufficient, then there are innumerable qualities of the subtle Vanaspatikaayik sufficient, then there are many more of the general subtle sufficient. (4) The fourth alpabahutva is about the relationship between the sufficient and insufficient of each of these. It is as follows: the least are the gross sufficient, because they are finite and limited in area. Then there are innumerable qualities of the gross insufficient, because innumerable gross insufficient are produced in the destruction of each gross sufficient. Then there are innumerable qualities of the subtle insufficient, because their area is innumerable due to their pervasiveness in all the worlds. Then there are innumerable qualities of the subtle sufficient, because they are eternal and always acquire innumerable qualities. There are seven sutras in total here: 1. General to subtle - gross sufficient-insufficient, 2. Subtle - gross Prithvikaayik sufficient-insufficient, 3. Subtle - gross Apkaayik sufficient-insufficient, 4. Subtle - gross Tejaskaayik sufficient-insufficient, 5. Subtle - gross Vaayukaayik sufficient-insufficient, 6. Subtle - gross Vanaspatikaayik sufficient-insufficient, and 7. Subtle - gross Nigod sufficient-insufficient.

Generally, Nigoda is a subtle and ordinary plant form, however, it has a separate identity. Therefore, it has been said to be of two types - Nigoda and Nigodajiva / Nigoda is the basic body of infinite beings and Nigodajiva is the infinite beings with different Tejas-Karman bodies residing in one Audarik body. 'Pagam' says - This whole world is filled with Sukshma Nigodas like a container filled with collyrium powder. This world filled with Nigodas is called "Golak" because of the innumerable Nigodas being circular and large in size / There are innumerable such spheres and in each sphere there are innumerable Nigodas and in each Nigoda there are infinite beings. Both Nigoda and Nigodajiva are of two types - Sukshma Nigoda and Badar Nigoda / Sukshma Nigoda are present in the whole world and Badar Nigoda are in the form of roots, tubers etc. Both these Sukshma and Badar Nigodajiva are of two types - Paryaptak and Aparyaptak / 223. Nigoda, Bhagavan! Are they countable, uncountable or infinite in terms of matter? Gautama! They are countable, uncountable, not infinite / Similarly, in terms of being Paryaptak and Aparyaptak / Suhamani Nigoda, Bhagavan! Are they countable, uncountable or infinite in terms of matter? Gautama! They are not countable, uncountable, not infinite / Similarly, in terms of being Paryaptak and Aparyaptak / Similarly, in terms of being Paryaptak and Aparyaptak, Badar Nigoda are not countable, uncountable, not infinite / Nigodajiva, Bhagavan! Are they countable, uncountable or infinite in terms of matter? Gautama! They are not countable, not uncountable, infinite.

Similarly, their sufficient and insufficient sutras should also be stated. Bhagavan! Are subtle Nigoda dravyas countable, uncountable, or infinite in number? Gautama! They are not countable, they are uncountable, they are not infinite. Similarly, the sutras concerning sufficient and insufficient should also be stated. Similarly, the same should be said about the Badar Nigoda. Their sufficient and insufficient sutras should also be stated in the same way / Bhagavan! Are Nigoda-jiva dravyas countable, uncountable, or infinite in number? Gautama! They are not countable, they are not uncountable, they are infinite. Similarly, their sufficient sutras should also be known / Similarly, the subtle Nigoda-jiva, their sufficient and insufficient sutras, and the Badar, their sufficient and insufficient sutras should also be stated. (These are eighteen sutras in total, nine for Nigoda and nine for Nigoda-jiva, in terms of dravyas.) Bhagavan! Are Nigoda countable, uncountable, or infinite in number in terms of their expanse? Gautama! They are not countable, they are not uncountable, but they are infinite. Similarly, the sufficient and insufficient sutras should also be stated. Similarly, the subtle Nigoda and their sufficient and insufficient sutras should be stated / All these are infinite in terms of their expanse. Similarly, the Badar Nigoda and their sufficient and insufficient sutras should be stated. All these are infinite in terms of their expanse. Similarly, in terms of the expanse of the Nigoda-jiva, nine sutras should be stated as infinite. Discussion: The present sutra deals with the inquiry and answer regarding the number of Nigoda and Nigoda-jiva. The inquiry is made whether the Nigoda are countable, uncountable, or infinite? The answers to these questions are from two perspectives: in terms of dravyas and in terms of expanse / In terms of dravyas, the Nigoda are not countable, because the Nigoda that permeate all the lokas are immeasurable in terms of angula-samkhyeya-bhag. They are uncountable, because they are as vast as the expanse of countless lokas and akasha. They are not infinite, because only the knowers have not known them to be infinite / The three sutras related to the general Nigoda, the insufficient general Nigoda, and the sufficient general Nigoda should be known in the same way / Similarly, three sutras for the subtle Nigoda and three sutras for the Badar Nigoda - a total of nine sutras have been stated. The Nigoda-jiva are not countable, not uncountable, but infinite in terms of dravyas / Since there are infinite jivas in each Nigoda, the Nigoda-jiva are infinite in terms of dravyas. Similarly, in their insufficient and sufficient sutras, they should also be stated as infinite.

[142] In the same way, the three sutras of the subtle-nigoda-jiva and their insufficient and sufficient should also be said to be infinite. Similarly, the three sutras of the badara-nigoda-jiva and their insufficient and sufficient should also be said to be infinite. / The above description was with respect to the substance. With respect to the regions, the general, insufficient, sufficient, subtle and badara nigodas and nigoda-jivas should all be said to be infinite in all eighteen sutras. Because there are infinite regions in each nigoda. / These eighteen sutras are as follows: 9 of the nigoda and 9 of the nigoda-jivas, totaling 18. / The 9 sutras of the nigoda are: nigoda-general, nigoda-insufficient, nigoda-sufficient; subtle-nigoda-general, subtle-nigoda-insufficient, subtle-nigoda-sufficient; badara-nigoda-general, badara-nigoda-insufficient and badara-nigoda-sufficient. / The 9 sutras of the nigoda-jiva are: nigoda-jiva-general, nigoda-jiva-insufficient and nigoda-jiva-sufficient.

225. Those who say that there are seven types of beings who are involved in the cycle of birth and death (samsara), they say that these seven types are: Nairyika, Tiryanch, Tiryanch (Tiryanch), Manushya, Manushi, Deva and Devi. The Nairyika have a minimum lifespan of ten thousand years and a maximum lifespan of thirty-three Sagaropama. The Tiryanch have a minimum lifespan of Antomuhurta and a maximum lifespan of three Palyopama. The Tiryanch, Manushya and Manushi also have the same lifespan. The Devas have a lifespan similar to the Nairyika, and the Devis have a minimum lifespan of ten thousand years and a maximum lifespan of fifty-five Palyopama. The Nairyika, Devas and Devis have the same lifespan as their Kayasthiti (physical form). The Tiryanch have a minimum lifespan of Antomuhurta and a maximum lifespan of infinite time. The Tiryanch have a minimum lifespan of Antomuhurta and a maximum lifespan of three Palyopama, which is greater than the previous Kotipruthaktva. Similarly, the Manushya and Manushi also have the same Kayasthiti. The Nairyika have a minimum lifespan of Antomuhurta and a maximum lifespan of Vanasakal. Similarly, all the Tiryanch have a minimum lifespan of Antomuhurta and a maximum lifespan of Sagaropama, which is greater than the previous Kotipruthaktva. The Manushi have a minimum lifespan of Appabahu, the Manushya have a minimum lifespan of Asankhyeya Guna, the Nairyika have a minimum lifespan of Asankhyeya Guna, the Tiryanch have a minimum lifespan of Asankhyeya Guna, the Devas have a minimum lifespan of Asankhyeya Guna, the Devis have a minimum lifespan of Sankhyeya Guna, and the Tiryanch have a minimum lifespan of Anant Guna. These are the seven types of beings who are involved in the cycle of birth and death (samsara).

##  Translation:

[146] The difference between **Nairyikas** is a minimum of an **antarmuhurt** and a maximum of **vanaspatikala** (infinite time).  Except for **tiryakyonikas**, the difference for all others should be considered the same.  The difference between **tiryakyonikas** is a minimum of an **antarmuhurt** and a maximum of **sadhik sagaropama shataprithaktva**.

The relative abundance is as follows: the fewest are **human females**, then **humans** are countless times more, then **Nairyikas** are countless times more, then **tiryak striyas** are countless times more, then **Devas** are countless times more, then **Devis** are countable times more, and finally **tiryakyonikas** are infinite times more.

This sevenfold **samsara**-ending **pratipatti** is complete.

**Discussion:** According to the sevenfold **pratipatti**, there are seven types of **samsara**-ending beings: **Nairyikas**, **tiryakyonikas**, **tiryak striyas**, **humans**, **human females**, **Devas**, and **Devis**.

The **position**, **sanchittana**, **difference**, and **relative abundance** of these seven are explained in this **sutra**.

**Position:** The position of **Nairyikas** is a minimum of ten thousand years and a maximum of thirty-three **sagaropama**. The minimum position of **tiryakyonikas**, **tiryakyonika striyas**, **humans**, and **human females** is an **antarmuhurt** and a maximum of three **palyopama**. The position of **Devas** is a minimum of ten thousand years and a maximum of thirty-three **sagaropama**. The position of **Devis** is a minimum of ten thousand years and a maximum of fifty-five **palyopama**. This position is relative to the **Isan Devis** who are not subject to **parigriha**.

**Sanchittana:** The **sanchittana** (body state) of **Nairyikas**, **Devas**, and **Devis** should be understood as the same as their **bhavasthiti** (state of being). This is because **Nairyikas** and **Devas** do not become **Nairyikas** or **Devas** in the next life after death. The **sanchittana** of **tiryakyonikas** is a minimum of an **antarmuhurt** (it is possible to be born elsewhere after this time) and a maximum of **anantakala** (infinite time). This **anantakala** is infinite in terms of **utsarpini-avsarpin** (ascending-descending time) and in terms of **kshetramargana** (spatial movement), it should be understood as the time it takes to empty countless **lokaakasha** regions by removing them one by one at a time. This **anantakala** is also countless in terms of **pudgalparavarta** (transformation of matter). The **sanchittana** (body state) of **tiryak striyas** is a minimum of an **antarmuhurt** and a maximum of **purvakotiprithaktva** plus three **palyopama**. This is relative to the seven **bhavas** (existences) with a lifespan of **purvakoti** and the eighth **bhavas** where they are born as **Devakuru** etc. The body state of **humans** and **human females** should be understood in the same way.

**Difference:** The difference between **Nairyikas** is a minimum of an **antarmuhurt**. This should be understood as the difference between being born in **naraka** (hell) and being born in a **tiryak** or **human** womb after being released from **naraka** and dying with an **ashubha adhyavasaya** (unfavorable determination). The maximum difference is **anantakala**. This **anantakala** should be understood as **vanaspatikala**. This is the difference between being released from **naraka** and living in a **vanaspati** (plant) for an infinite time and then being born again in **naraka**.

The minimum difference between **tiryakyonikas** is an **antarmuhurt** and the maximum difference is **sadhik sagaropama shataprithaktva** (two hundred to nine hundred **sagaropama**).

The difference between **tiryakyonikas**, **humans**, **human females**, **Devas**, and **Devis** is a minimum of an **antarmuhurt** and a maximum of **vanaspatikala**.

## The Seventh Understanding of the Eightfold Path (226)

Those who say that the beings who have attained the end of the cycle of existence are of eight types, according to them, these are the eight types: 1. **Prathama-samaya-nairyaika**, 2. **A-prathamasamaya-nairyaika**, 3. **Prathama-samaya-tiryag-yoni**, 4. **A-prathamasamaya-tiryag-yoni**, 5. **Prathama-samaya-manushya**, 6. **A-prathamasamaya-manushya**, 7. **Prathama-samaya-deva**, and 8. **A-prathamasamaya-deva**.

**Question:**  O Bhagavan! How long is the **Prathama-samaya-nairyaika**'s existence?

**Answer:**  O Gautama! From the lowest, it is one **samaya**, and from the highest, it is also one **samaya**.

**Question:**  How long is the **A-prathamasamaya-nairyaika**'s existence?

**Answer:**  From the lowest, it is one **samaya** less than ten thousand years, and from the highest, it is one **samaya** less than thirty-three **sagaropama**.

## The Seventh Attainment of the Eightfold Path

**[149] The state of a *Prathmasamaya* *Tiryagyoni* is the most inferior for one *samaya* and the most superior also for one *samaya*. The state of an *Apathmasamaya* *Tiryagyoni* is the most inferior for one *samaya* less than a *Kshullakabhavagrahan* and the most superior for one *samaya* less than three *Palyaopamas*.**

**In the same way, the state of humans should be said to be similar to that of *Tiryagyonis* and the state of gods should be said to be similar to that of *Nairyikas*.**

**The state of *Nairyikas* and gods is the same for both types ( *Prathmasamaya* and *Apathmasamaya*) of *Nairyikas* and gods, which is the state of the body ( *Sanchittana*).**

**O Bhagavan! For how long can a *Prathmasamaya* *Tiryagyoni* remain in that form?**

**Gautama! It can remain for one *samaya* in the most inferior state and also for one *samaya* in the most superior state. An *Apathmasamaya* *Tiryagyoni* can remain for one *samaya* less than a *Kshullakabhav* in the most inferior state and for the duration of a *Vanaspatikala* in the most superior state.**

**A *Prathmasamaya* human can remain for one *samaya* in the most inferior state and for one *samaya* in the most superior state. An *Apathmasamaya* human can remain for one *samaya* less than a *Kshullakabhavagrahan* in the most inferior state and for one *samaya* less than three *Palyaopamas* plus the *Purvakotiprithaktva* in the most superior state.**

**227. Difference:**

**- For a *Prathmasamaya* *Nairyika*, the most inferior state is for ten thousand *Vasa* less than a *Muhurta* and the most superior state is for the duration of a *Vanaspatikala*.**

**- For an *Apathmasamaya* *Nairyika*, the most inferior state is for one *Muhurta* and the most superior state is for the duration of a *Vanaspatikala*.**

**- For a *Prathmasamaya* *Tiryagyoni*, the most inferior state is for two *Kshullakabhavagrahan* less than one *Samaya* and the most superior state is for the duration of a *Vanaspatikala*.**

**- For an *Apathmasamaya* *Tiryagyoni*, the most inferior state is for one *Kshullakabhavagrahan* plus one *Samaya* and the most superior state is for the duration of a *Sagaro Bama* plus one *Samaya*.**

**- For a *Prathmasamaya* human, the most inferior state is for two *Kshullakabhavagrahan* less than one *Samaya* and the most superior state is for the duration of a *Vanaspatikala*.**

**- For an *Apathmasamaya* human, the most inferior state is for one *Kshullakabhavagrahan* plus one *Samaya* and the most superior state is for the duration of a *Vanaspatikala*.**

**- For gods, just like *Nairyikas*, the most inferior state is for ten thousand *Vasa* less than a *Muhurta* and the most superior state is for the duration of a *Vanaspatikala*.**

**- For *Apathmasamaya* gods, the most inferior state is for one *Muhurta* and the most superior state is for the duration of a *Vanaspatikala*.**

**Few or Many:**

**O Bhagavan! Among these, from *Prathmasamaya* *Nairyikas* to *Prathmasamaya* gods, who are few and who are many?**

**Gautama! In all cases, *Prathmasamaya* humans are countless, *Prathmasamaya* *Nairyikas* are countless, *Prathmasamaya* gods are countless, *Prathmasamaya* *Tiryagyonis* are countless, *Apathmasamaya* *Nairyikas* to *Apathmasamaya* gods are also the same, few or many, but *Apathmasamaya* *Tiryagyonis* are infinite.**

**Among these, from *Prathmasamaya* *Nairyikas* to *Apathmasamaya* *Nairyikas*, who are few and who are many?**

**In all cases, *Prathmasamaya* *Nairyikas* are countless, *Apathmasamaya* *Nairyikas* are countless. It is the same for all.**

**1. 256 *Pavalikas* constitute a *Kshullakabhav*.**

The *Saras-Samavan-na-Gaa* Jiva is the essence of all beings. The *Attha-Viha-Padi-Vattee* is the complete explanation. 227. 

The shortest lifespan of a *Prathama-Samaya-Nairyika* is ten thousand years more than an *Anta-Muhurta*, and the longest is a *Vanaspati-Kaal*. The shortest lifespan of an *A-Prathama-Samaya-Nairyika* is an *Anta-Muhurta*, and the longest is a *Vanaspati-Kaal*. The shortest lifespan of a *Prathama-Samaya-Tiryak-Yoni* is two *Kshullaka-Bhava-Grahana* less than one *Samaya*, and the longest is a *Vanaspati-Kaal*. The shortest lifespan of an *A-Prathama-Samaya-Tiryak-Yoni* is one *Kshullaka-Bhava-Grahana* more than one *Samaya*, and the longest is slightly more than a *Sagara-Upam-Shat-Prithaktva*. The shortest lifespan of a *Prathama-Samaya-Manushya* is two *Kshullaka-Bhava* less than one *Samaya*, and the longest is a *Vanaspati-Kaal*. The shortest lifespan of an *A-Prathama-Samaya-Manushya* is one *Kshullaka-Bhava* more than one *Samaya*, and the longest is a *Vanaspati-Kaal*.  

The lifespan of *Deva* should be described in the same way as *Nairyika*. For example, the shortest lifespan of a *Prathama-Samaya-Deva* is ten thousand years more than an *Anta-Muhurta*, and the longest is a *Vanaspati-Kaal*. The shortest lifespan of an *A-Prathama-Samaya-Deva* is an *Anta-Muhurta*, and the longest is a *Vanaspati-Kaal*. 

**Alpa-Bahutva-Dwaar** -  O Bhagavan! Who is less, more, equal, or superior among *Prathama-Samaya-Nairyika* to *Prathama-Samaya-Deva*? 

Gautam! The fewest are *Prathama-Samaya-Manushya*. *Prathama-Samaya-Nairyika* are countless times more than them. *Prathama-Samaya-Deva* are countless times more than them. *Prathama-Samaya-Tiryak-Yoni* are countless times more than them. 

The *Alpa-Bahutva* of *A-Prathama-Samaya-Nairyika* to *A-Prathama-Samaya-Deva* is the same as above, but *A-Prathama-Samaya-Tiryak-Yoni* should be considered infinite times more. 

O Bhagavan! Who is less, more, equal, or superior among *Prathama-Samaya-Nairyika* and *A-Prathama-Samaya-Nairyika*? 

Gautam! The fewest are *Prathama-Samaya-Nairyika*. *A-Prathama-Samaya-Nairyika* are countless times more than them. 

Similarly, the *Alpa-Bahutva* of *Tiryak-Yoni*, *Manushya*, and *Deva* should be described for both *Prathama-Samaya* and *A-Prathama-Samaya*. 

O Bhagavan! Who is less, more, equal, or superior among *Prathama-Samaya-Nairyika* to *A-Prathama-Samaya-Deva*? 

Gautam! The fewest are *Prathama-Samaya-Manushya*. *A-Prathama-Samaya-Manushya* are countless times more than them. *Prathama-Samaya-Nairyika* are countless times more than them. *Prathama-Samaya-Deva* are countless times more than them. *Prathama-Samaya-Tiryak-Yoni* are countless times more than them.

## The Eighthfold Path: The Seventh Understanding [151 Qualities]

This section describes the eight types of beings who have attained liberation from the cycle of birth and death. 

**The Seventh Understanding: The Eightfold Path**

This seventh understanding discusses the eight types of beings who have attained liberation from the cycle of birth and death. These eight types are categorized as: Naraka (hell beings), Tiryanch (animals), Manushya (humans), and Deva (gods). Each of these four categories is further divided into two subcategories: Prathmasamaya (those who are in their first lifetime) and Aprathmasamaya (those who are not in their first lifetime). This categorization encompasses all beings who have attained liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

**Prathmasamaya** beings are those who are in their first lifetime. **Aprathmasamaya** beings are those who are not in their first lifetime.

**The Eightfold Path**

The eight types of beings who have attained liberation from the cycle of birth and death are categorized based on their **position**, **duration of existence**, **interval between births**, and **frequency of birth**.

**Position**

* **Prathmasamaya Narayik:** The position of a Prathmasamaya Narayik is limited to a single lifetime, as they do not exist in subsequent lifetimes.
* **Aprathmasamaya Narayik:** The position of an Aprathmasamaya Narayik ranges from a minimum of 10,000 years less than a single lifetime to a maximum of 33 Sagaropama (a unit of time) less than a single lifetime.
* **Prathmasamaya Tiryanch:** The position of a Prathmasamaya Tiryanch is limited to a single lifetime.
* **Aprathmasamaya Tiryanch:** The position of an Aprathmasamaya Tiryanch ranges from a minimum of a Ksullakbhava (a unit of time) less than a single lifetime to a maximum of three Palyopama (a unit of time) less than a single lifetime.
* **Prathmasamaya Manushya:** The position of a Prathmasamaya Manushya is similar to that of a Tiryanch.
* **Aprathmasamaya Manushya:** The position of an Aprathmasamaya Manushya is similar to that of a Narayik.
* **Prathmasamaya Deva:** The position of a Prathmasamaya Deva is similar to that of a Narayik.
* **Aprathmasamaya Deva:** The position of an Aprathmasamaya Deva is similar to that of a Narayik.

**Duration of Existence (Sंचिट्ठणा)**

* **Deva and Narayik:** The duration of existence of Deva and Narayik is the same as their position, as they do not reincarnate as Deva or Narayik after death.
* **Prathmasamaya Tiryanch:** The duration of existence of a Prathmasamaya Tiryanch is limited to a single lifetime.
* **Aprathmasamaya Tiryanch:** The duration of existence of an Aprathmasamaya Tiryanch ranges from a minimum of a Ksullakbhava (a unit of time) less than a single lifetime to a maximum of an infinite duration (Vanaspatikala).
* **Prathmasamaya Manushya:** The duration of existence of a Prathmasamaya Manushya is limited to a single lifetime.
* **Aprathmasamaya Manushya:** The duration of existence of an Aprathmasamaya Manushya ranges from a minimum of a Ksullakbhava (a unit of time) less than a single lifetime to a maximum of three Palyopama (a unit of time) less than a single lifetime, minus the duration of the previous seven lifetimes.
* **Prathmasamaya Deva:** The duration of existence of a Prathmasamaya Deva is similar to that of a Narayik.
* **Aprathmasamaya Deva:** The duration of existence of an Aprathmasamaya Deva is similar to that of a Narayik.

**Interval Between Births (अंतर)**

* **Prathmasamaya Narayik:** The interval between births of a Prathmasamaya Narayik ranges from a minimum of 10,000 years plus an Antarmuhurta (a unit of time) to a maximum of an infinite duration.
* **Aprathmasamaya Narayik:** The interval between births of an Aprathmasamaya Narayik is a minimum of an Antarmuhurta (a unit of time).
* **Prathmasamaya Tiryanch:** The interval between births of a Prathmasamaya Tiryanch is similar to that of a Narayik.
* **Aprathmasamaya Tiryanch:** The interval between births of an Aprathmasamaya Tiryanch is similar to that of a Narayik.
* **Prathmasamaya Manushya:** The interval between births of a Prathmasamaya Manushya is similar to that of a Narayik.
* **Aprathmasamaya Manushya:** The interval between births of an Aprathmasamaya Manushya is similar to that of a Narayik.
* **Prathmasamaya Deva:** The interval between births of a Prathmasamaya Deva is similar to that of a Narayik.
* **Aprathmasamaya Deva:** The interval between births of an Aprathmasamaya Deva is similar to that of a Narayik.

**Frequency of Birth (अल्पबहुत्व)**

The frequency of birth is not explicitly mentioned in this text.

This concludes the discussion of the eight types of beings who have attained liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

## 152] This is the Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra. The term "Samaya-Adhikta" (excess time) is used because the first time is more. In some places, only "Antar-Muhurta" (inner moment) is mentioned; in this statement, the first time is also included in the "Antar-Muhurta," hence it is not mentioned separately. 

The difference from the peak is the "Vanaspatikala" (plant-time). In the "Tiryanch-Yoni" (animal realm), the lowest difference from the first time is the "Kshullak-Bhava-Grahan" (minor birth-absorption) of two "Kshallaka" (moments). These "Kshullaka" are due to the expectation of being born again in the animal realm after being obstructed from the "Manushya-Bhava-Grahan" (human birth-absorption). One "Bhava" is the "Tiryanch-Kshullak-Bhava" (animal minor birth-absorption) less than the first time, and the other is the "Kshullak-Bhava-Grahan" (minor birth-absorption) of the entire human being. The difference from the peak is the "Vanaspatikala" (plant-time). After its passing, there is an expectation of being born again as a "Pratham-Samaya-Tiryanch" (first-time animal) due to the obstruction of the "Manushya-Bhava" (human birth). 

The lowest difference from the "A-Pratham-Samaya-Tiryanch-Yoni" (non-first-time animal realm) is the "Samaya-Adhik-Kshullak-Bhava-Grahan" (excess-time minor birth-absorption). This should be understood as the "Tiryanch-Yoni-Kshullak-Bhava-Grahan" (animal realm minor birth-absorption) taking the maximum time, considering it as the "A-Pratham-Samaya" (non-first-time), and after dying in it, the "Kshullak-Bhava-Grahan" (minor birth-absorption) of a human being, and then the expectation of the first time passing after being born again in the animal realm. 

The difference from the peak is the "Sa-Adhik-Sagara-Upam-Shat-Prithaktva" (ocean-like hundred-fold separation). This is due to the expectation of being born again in the animal realm after wandering in the "Deva-Adi-Bhava" (heavenly realms) for so long. 

The "Vaktvyata" (speech) of humans is according to the "Tiryanch-Vaktvyata" (animal speech). Only there should the obstruction be said to be the "Tiryanch-Bhava" (animal birth). The speech of the "Deva" (gods) is the same as that of the "Nairyika" (hell beings). The "Alp-Bahutva" (small multitude) is said for the "Pratham-Alp-Bahutva" (first small multitude) of the "Pratham-Samaya-Nairyika" (first-time hell beings) up to the "Pratham-Samaya-Deva" (first-time gods). 

This is as follows: The fewest are the "Pratham-Samaya-Manushya" (first-time humans). They are like the "Prakash-Pradesh" (regions of light) in the innumerable parts of the category. The "Pratham-Samaya-Nairyika" (first-time hell beings) are innumerable times more than them, because they can be born in great abundance at one time. The "Pratham-Samaya-Deva" (first-time gods) are innumerable times more than them - the "Vyantar-Jyotishka-Deva" (intermediate luminous gods) can be born in even greater abundance at one time. The "Pratham-Samaya-Tiryanch" (first-time animals) are innumerable times more than them. Here, those who have come from the three "Gati" (paths) of "Naraka" (hell), etc., and are present in the "Pratham-Samaya" (first-time) of the "Tiryanch" (animal realm), are the "Pratham-Samaya-Tiryanch" (first-time animals), not the others. 

Therefore, although the innumerable part of the "Pratinigodi" (non-returner) is always in the "Pratham-Samaya" (first-time) of the "Vigraha-Gati" (path of disintegration), they are not "Pratham-Samaya-Tiryanch" (first-time animals) because they are also "Tiryanch" (animals). They are only a countable number of times more than them. 

The second "Alp-Bahutva" (small multitude) is said for the "A-Pratham-Samaya-Nairyika" (non-first-time hell beings) up to the "A-Pratham-Samaya-Deva" (non-first-time gods). It is as follows: The fewest are the "A-Pratham-Samaya-Manushya" (non-first-time humans), because they are as many as the innumerable parts of the category. 

The "A-Pratham-Samaya-Nairyika" (non-first-time hell beings) are innumerable times more than them, because they are as many as the "Pradesh-Rashi" (number of regions) obtained by multiplying the second square root by the first square root of the "Pradesh-Rashi" (number of regions) of the "Angul-Matra-Kshetra" (finger-sized area) in as many categories as there are "Akasha-Pradesh" (regions of space). The "A-Pratham-Samaya-Deva" (non-first-time gods) are innumerable times more than them, because the "Vyantar-Jyotishka-Deva" (intermediate luminous gods) are also very abundant. 

The "A-Pratham-Samaya-Tiryanch" (non-first-time animals) are infinite times more than them, because the "Vanaspatikaya" (plant bodies) are infinite. The third "Alp-Bahutva" (small multitude) is for the "Pratham-Samaya" (first-time) and "A-Pratham-Samaya" (non-first-time) in each "Narathika" (hell being), etc. It is as follows: The fewest are the "Pratham-Samaya-Nairyika" (first-time hell beings), because even though they are born in countless numbers at one time, ...

[The Seventh Principle of the Eightfold Path] [There are 153 verses / The number of first-time beings is very small, because they are ephemeral and are born in great numbers only for a short time. This is also true for the beings in the animal, human, and celestial realms. It is especially true for the animal realm, where the number of first-time animal beings is infinite, because the number of plant beings is infinite. The fourth principle, the principle of fewness, states that the number of first-time beings in hell, etc., is very small. The number of first-time human beings is the smallest, because even though they are born in great numbers, they are still few in number / The number of non-first-time human beings is countless times greater than the number of first-time human beings, because they are long-lasting and are born in great numbers / The number of first-time non-human beings is countless times greater than the number of non-first-time human beings, because they are born in great numbers at one time. The number of first-time celestial beings is countless times greater than the number of first-time non-human beings, because they are born in great numbers in the intermediate and luminous realms / The number of first-time animal beings is countless times greater than the number of first-time celestial beings, because beings are born from the three paths of hell, etc. The number of non-first-time non-human beings is countless times greater than the number of first-time animal beings, because they are equal to the number of categories in the square root of the second square root of the area of a space the size of an angul. The number of non-first-time animal beings is infinite, because the number of plant beings is infinite. Thus, the Seventh Principle, which describes the eightfold path of the world, is complete. // Thus ends the Seventh Principle //]

## The Eighth Understanding: The Nine Types of Liberation

This understanding discusses the nine types of liberation as described by those who expound on the nine types of liberation. These nine types are:

1. **Pṛthvīkāyika** (Earth-bodied)
2. **Apakāyika** (Water-bodied)
3. **Tejaskaayika** (Fire-bodied)
4. **Vāyukāyika** (Air-bodied)
5. **Vanaspatikāyika** (Plant-bodied)
6. **Dvīndriya** (Two-sensed)
7. **Trīndriya** (Three-sensed)
8. **Caturindriya** (Four-sensed)
9. **Pañcendriya** (Five-sensed)

**Duration:**

The shortest duration for all these types is an **antarmuhūrta** (a moment between two muhūrtas). The longest duration is:

* **Pṛthvīkāyika:** 22,000 years
* **Apakāyika:** 7,000 years
* **Tejaskaayika:** 3 days
* **Vāyukāyika:** 3,000 years
* **Vanaspatikāyika:** 10,000 years
* **Dvīndriya:** 12 years
* **Trīndriya:** 49 days
* **Caturindriya:** 6 months
* **Pañcendriya:** 33 sagaropama (a measure of time equivalent to 33 oceans)

**Accumulation:**

The shortest accumulation (duration of existence) for all these types is an **antarmuhūrta**. The longest accumulation is:

* **Pṛthvīkāyika:** Asankhyeya kāla (an immeasurable period of time encompassing countless cycles of upsurge and downsurge, and countless regions of space within the universe)
* **Apakāyika, Tejaskaayika, Vāyukāyika:** Similar to Pṛthvīkāyika
* **Vanaspatikāyika:** Ananta kāla (infinite time) encompassing countless cycles of upsurge and downsurge, countless regions of space within the universe, and countless transformations of pudgala (matter)
* **Dvīndriya, Trīndriya, Caturindriya:** Sankhyeya kāla (measurable time)
* **Pañcendriya:** 1,000 sagaropama

**Interval:**

The shortest interval (time between births) for **Pṛthvīkāyika** is an **antarmuhūrta**, and the longest is **ananta kāla** (infinite time). This infinite time is similar to the previous explanation. The interval between a Pṛthvīkāyika leaving its body and being reborn as a Vanaspatikāyika is ananta kāla. The interval for other types should be understood similarly.

The shortest interval for **Vanaspatikāyika** is an **antarmuhūrta**, and the longest is **asankhyeya kāla** (immeasurable time) encompassing countless cycles of upsurge and downsurge.

**Number:**

* **Pañcendriya** are the least numerous, existing in a number equal to countless regions of space within the universe, each region being countless yojanas (a measure of distance) in diameter.
* **Caturindriya** are more numerous than Pañcendriya, existing in a number equal to countless yojanas in diameter.
* **Trīndriya** are more numerous than Caturindriya, existing in a number equal to countless yojanas in diameter.
* **Dvīndriya** are more numerous than Trīndriya, existing in a number equal to countless yojanas in diameter.
* **Tejaskaayika** are countless times more numerous than Dvīndriya, existing in a number equal to countless regions of space within the universe.
* **Pṛthvīkāyika** are more numerous than Tejaskaayika, existing in a number equal to countless regions of space within the universe.
* **Apakāyika** are more numerous than Pṛthvīkāyika, existing in a number equal to countless regions of space within the universe.
* **Vāyukāyika** are more numerous than Apakāyika, existing in a number equal to countless regions of space within the universe.
* **Vanaspatikāyika** are infinitely more numerous than Vāyukāyika, existing in a number equal to infinite regions of space within the universe.

**Conclusion:**

This is the eighth understanding, which explains the nine types of liberation.

229. Those who teach the ten types of beings who end the cycle of existence, describe them as follows: 1. Prathamasamayaekendriya 2. Aprathamasamayaekendriya 3. Prathamasamayadviendriya 4. Aprathamasamayadviendriya 5. Prathamasamayatriendriya 6. Aprathamasamayatriendriya 7. Prathamasamaychaturiendriya 8. Aprathamasamaychaturiendriya 9. Prathamasamaypanchendriya 10. Aprathamasamaypanchendriya. /  Bhagavan! What is the duration of the Prathamasamayaekendriya? Gautama! The lowest duration is one time period, and the highest is also one time period. The lowest duration of the Aprathamasamayaekendriya is one time period less than the shortest bhavagrahan, and the highest is one time period less than twenty-two thousand years. /  Similarly, the lowest duration of all Prathamasamayikas is one time period, and the highest is also one time period. The lowest duration of the Aprathamasamayikas is one time period less than the shortest bhavagrahan, and the highest is one time period less than the duration of the respective being, up to thirty-three sagaropama for the Panchendriya. /

The ninth attainment of the tenfold classification [157. The accumulation (body state) of the first-time beings is one time less than the lowest and one time more than the highest / The accumulation (body state) of the non-first-time beings is one time less than the lowest, a small-being-grasp, and the highest is the plant-period of the one-sensed, the countable-period of the two-sensed, three-sensed, and four-sensed, and the saadic thousand-ocean-like period of the five-sensed. 230. What is the difference between the first-time one-sensed beings? Gautama! The lowest is two small-being-grasps less than the time, and the highest is the plant-period. The difference between the non-first-time one-sensed beings is one small-being-grasp more than the time, and the highest is two thousand ocean-like years of countable-period. _The difference between all the rest of the first-time beings is two small-being-grasps less than the time, and the highest is the plant-period / The difference between the rest of the non-first-time beings is one small-being-grasp more than the time, and the highest is the plant-period. Among all the first-time beings, the fewest are the first-time five-sensed, the first-time four-sensed are more special, the first-time three-sensed are more special, the first-time two-sensed are more special, and the first-time one-sensed are more special. Similarly, the scarcity of the non-first-time beings should also be known. The special feature is that the non-first-time one-sensed are infinitely numerous.  

Both the first-time one-sensed and the non-first-time one-sensed are infinitely numerous / The rest of the first-time beings and the non-first-time beings are countless times numerous / Thus, Venerable Sir! Is there any difference between the first-time one-sensed, the non-first-time one-sensed, and the non-first-time four-sensed, whether it is less, more, equal, or special? Gautama! The first-time four-sensed are special, the first-time three-sensed are special, the first-time two-sensed are special, and so on down to the first-time one-sensed are special, the non-first-time five-sensed are countless times numerous, the non-first-time four-sensed are special, and so on down to the non-first-time one-sensed are infinitely numerous / Thus, the beings who are bound to the cycle of existence are liberated. Thus, the beings who are bound to the cycle of existence are liberated. 230. Bhagavan! What is the difference between the first-time one-sensed beings? Gautama! The lowest is two small-being-grasps less than the time, and the highest is the plant-period / The difference between the non-first-time one-sensed beings is one time more than the time, and the highest is two thousand ocean-like years of countable-period. The difference between all the rest of the first-time beings is one time less than the time, and the highest is the plant-period / The difference between the rest of the non-first-time beings is one small-being-grasp more than the time, and the highest is the plant-period. Among all the first-time beings, the fewest are the first-time five-sensed, the first-time four-sensed are more special, the first-time three-sensed are more special, the first-time two-sensed are more special, and the first-time one-sensed are more special. Similarly, the scarcity of the non-first-time beings should also be known. The special feature is that the non-first-time one-sensed are infinitely numerous.

158 The **Jiva**s with one sense organ in their first time are very few, and those with one sense organ in their later time are infinitely numerous. The rest are very few in their first time, and those in their later time are innumerable. 

O Bhagavan! Among these **Jiva**s with one sense organ in their first time, one sense organ in their later time, and so on up to those with five sense organs in their later time, who is less, who is more, who is equal, and who is superior?

Gautama! The **Jiva**s with five sense organs in their first time are the least, those with four sense organs in their first time are superior to them, those with three sense organs in their first time are superior to them, those with two sense organs in their first time are superior to them, those with one sense organ in their first time are superior to them, those with five sense organs in their later time are innumerable times superior to them, those with four sense organs in their later time are superior to them, those with three sense organs in their later time are superior to them, those with two sense organs in their later time are superior to them, and those with one sense organ in their later time are infinitely numerous. Thus, the description of the ten types of **Jiva**s who have attained liberation from the cycle of birth and death is complete.

Thus, the description of the **Jiva**s who have attained liberation from the cycle of birth and death is complete. In this understanding, ten types of **Jiva**s who have attained liberation from the cycle of birth and death have been described, which are obtained by dividing the **Jiva**s with one sense organ to five sense organs into two categories: first time and later time.

The **Jiva**s with one sense organ in their first time are those who are in the first time of having one sense organ. The rest of the **Jiva**s with one sense organ are those with one sense organ in their later time. Similarly, one should understand the same for those with two sense organs, etc.

The state, duration, difference, and relative abundance of these ten types of **Jiva**s have been explained in this understanding.

**State:** The state of the **Jiva** with one sense organ in their first time is the lowest and the highest for one time, because in other times, it is not in its first time. Similarly, one should understand the same for those with two sense organs, etc. in their first time.

The state of the **Jiva** with one sense organ in their later time is one time less than the lowest state, which is **Ksullakbhava** (256 **Shravalika**-measures). The meaning of one time less is that it is not in its later time in the first time. The highest state is one time less than twenty-two thousand years.

The lowest state of the **Jiva** with two sense organs in their later time is one time less than **Ksullakbhava**-grasp, and the highest state is one time less than twelve years. The lowest state of the **Jiva** with three sense organs in their later time is one time less than **Ksullakbhava**, and the highest state is one time less than 49 days and nights.

The lowest state of the **Jiva** with four sense organs in their later time is one time less than **Ksullakbhava**, and the highest state is one time less than six months.

The lowest state of the **Jiva** with five sense organs in their later time is one time less than **Ksullakbhava**, and the highest state is one time less than thirty-three **Sagaropama**s. In all cases, one should understand that the time less is less than the first time.

**Duration (Body State):** The **Jiva** with one sense organ in their first time remains in that form for one time. After that, it is not in its first time. Similarly, one should understand the same for those with two sense organs, etc. in their first time.

The **Jiva** with one sense organ in their later time remains for one time less than the lowest state, **Ksullakbhava**-grasp. Then, it can be born elsewhere. It remains for an infinite time from the highest state. The explanation of infinite time is as follows: one should know that it is until the infinite **Avasarpini** and **Utsarpini** times, etc.

The **Jiva** with two sense organs in their later time remains for one time less than **Ksullakbhava** from the lowest state, and for a countable time from the highest state. Then, it is definitely born elsewhere. Similarly, one should understand the same for the **Jiva** with three sense organs and four sense organs in their later time.

## The Ninth Attainment of the Tenfold Knowledge

**[159 The First-Time Five-Sensory Being]**

The lifespan of a First-Time Five-Sensory being ranges from a minimum of two *ksullakabhava* (brief existences) to a maximum of a thousand *sagaropama* (ocean-like periods), as they can only remain in the Five-Sensory state for this duration while continuously transmigrating through the realms of gods and others.

**[The Interval of the First-Time One-Sensory Being]**

The interval of the First-Time One-Sensory being is two *ksullakabhava* at the minimum. These *ksullakabhava* are due to the obstruction of the *ksullakabhava* of the Two-Sensory and higher beings, which prevents them from being reborn as One-Sensory beings again. For example, one *ksullakabhava* is the *ksullakabhava* of the First-Time One-Sensory being, and the other is the entire *ksullakabhava* of the Two-Sensory and higher beings. Thus, one should understand that there are two *ksullakabhava* at the minimum.

The maximum interval is the *vanaspatikala* (plant-like period) to infinity, which has been explained previously. For this duration, it is a Non-First-Time One-Sensory being, not a First-Time One-Sensory being. Because when a being remains in the *ksullakabhava* of the Two-Sensory and higher beings and is then reborn as a One-Sensory being, it is called a First-Time One-Sensory being in the First-Time. Therefore, the maximum interval is called the *vanaspatikala*.

The minimum interval of the Non-First-Time One-Sensory being is the *ksullakabhava* of the *samayadhika* (time-exceeding). It is obtained when the being dies in the *charamasamaya* (final time) of the One-Sensory state, and due to the obstruction of the *ksullakabhava* of the Two-Sensory and higher beings, it is reborn as a One-Sensory being again after the First-Time of the One-Sensory state has passed. This duration is the interval of the Non-First-Time One-Sensory being.

The maximum interval can be two thousand *sagaropama* plus a *sankhyeya* (countable) number of years. The transmigration through the realms of the Two-Sensory and higher beings is only possible for this duration.

**[The Interval of the First-Time Two-Sensory Being]**

The minimum interval of the First-Time Two-Sensory being is two *ksullakabhava*. One is the *ksullakabhava* of the Non-First-Time Two-Sensory being, and the other is any *ksullakabhava* of the entire One-Sensory, Three-Sensory, and higher beings. Similarly, one should understand the intervals of the First-Time Three-Sensory, First-Time Four-Sensory, and First-Time Five-Sensory beings.

**[The Interval of the Non-First-Time Two-Sensory Being]**

The minimum interval of the Non-First-Time Two-Sensory being is the *ksullakabhava* of the *samayadhika*. It is obtained when the being remains in the *ksullakabhava* of other beings and is reborn as a Two-Sensory being again after the First-Time of the Two-Sensory state has passed.

The maximum interval is infinity. This infinity is the infinity of the past *utsarpini* (ascending) and *pravasarpini* (descending) cycles. It should be stated that this interval is obtained after the being exits the Two-Sensory state, remains in the plant-like state for this duration, and is reborn as a Two-Sensory being again after the First-Time has passed.

One should understand the minimum and maximum intervals of the Non-First-Time Three-Sensory, Four-Sensory, and Five-Sensory beings.

**[The First Fewness]**

The first fewness is stated with respect to the First-Time beings. It is as follows:

The fewest are the First-Time Five-Sensory beings, because they are born in small numbers at a time. The First-Time Four-Sensory beings are more numerous than them, because they are born in greater numbers at a time. The First-Time Three-Sensory beings are more numerous than them, because they are born in even greater numbers at a time. The First-Time Two-Sensory beings are more numerous than them, because they are born in the greatest numbers at a time. The First-Time One-Sensory beings are more numerous than them.

Here, one should understand that the First-Time One-Sensory beings are those who are born as One-Sensory beings after exiting the Two-Sensory and higher beings and are present in the First-Time, not others. They are more numerous than the First-Time Two-Sensory beings, but not by an immeasurable or infinite amount. 

Page #671:
---------------------------
[160] The second *alpabahutva* (scarcity) is stated with respect to the *aprathamasamayika* (non-first-time) souls. It is as follows: The fewest are the *aprathamasamaya* (non-first-time) *panchendriya* (five-sensed) souls, then the *aprathamasamaya* *chaturindriya* (four-sensed) souls are more numerous, then the *aprathamasamaya* *triindriya* (three-sensed) souls are more numerous, then the *aprathamasamaya* *dviindriya* (two-sensed) souls are more numerous, then the *aprathamasamaya* *ekendriya* (one-sensed) souls are infinitely numerous. The third *alpabahutva* is with respect to the *prathamasamaya* (first-time) and *aprathamasamaya* souls in each *ekendriya* etc. It is as follows: The fewest are the *prathamasamaya* *ekendriya* souls, because they are born in a single time period from the *dviindriya* etc. The *aprathamasamaya* *ekendriya* souls are infinitely numerous, because the *vanaspatikala* (plant-like state) is infinite. Among the *dviindriya* souls, the fewest are the *prathamasamaya* *dviindriya* souls, the *aprathamasamaya* *dviindriya* souls are innumerable times more numerous, because the *dviindriya* souls are innumerable even by number. Similarly, among the *triindriya*, *chaturindriya*, and *panchendriya* souls, the *prathamasamaya* souls are fewer and the *aprathamasamaya* souls are innumerable times more numerous. The fourth *alpabahutva* is stated with respect to the aforementioned ten categories. It is as follows: The fewest are the *prathamasamaya* *panchendriya* souls, then the *prathamasamaya* *chaturindriya* souls are more numerous, then the *prathamasamaya* *triindriya* souls are more numerous, then the *prathamasamaya* *dviindriya* souls are more numerous, then the *prathamasamaya* *ekendriya* souls are more numerous, then the *aprathamasamaya* *panchendriya* souls are innumerable times more numerous, then the *aprathamasamaya* *chaturindriya* souls are more numerous, then the *aprathamasamaya* *triindriya* souls are more numerous, then the *aprathamasamaya* *dviindriya* souls are more numerous, then the *aprathamasamaya* *ekendriya* souls are infinitely numerous. The reasoning is clear. Thus, the ten types of *pratipatti* (understanding) are complete. With their completion, the *jivaabhigam* (approach of the soul) that leads to the cessation of the cycle of birth and death is also complete. 00 

Page #672:
---------------------------
After expounding on the ten types of attainments of the liberated souls (samsarasamaapannak jivas), we now discuss the concept of Sarvajivaabhigam. This Sarvajivaabhigam encompasses both the liberated souls (samsarasamaapannak) and the non-liberated souls (asamsarasamaapannak). 231.  "O Bhagavan! What is Sarvajivaabhigam?" "Gautama! There are nine types of attainments in Sarvajivaabhigam. Some say that all jivas are of two types, and some say that they are of ten types." "Those who say that all jivas are of two types, say that they are Siddha and Asiddha." "O Bhagavan! How long can a Siddha remain as a Siddha?" "Gautama! A Siddha is Saadi-Apayavasit (eternal)." "O Bhagavan! How long can an Asiddha remain as an Asiddha?" "Gautama! An Asiddha is of two types: Pranai-Apayavasit and Pranai-Sapayavasit." "O Bhagavan! What is the difference between a Siddha and an Asiddha?" "Gautama! There is no difference between a Saadi-Apayavasit and a Siddha." "O Bhagavan! What is the difference between an Asiddha and a Siddha?" "Gautama! There is no difference between a Pranai-Apayavasit and an Asiddha. There is no difference between a Pranai-Sapayavasit and an Asiddha." "O Bhagavan! How many times are the Siddhas and Asiddhas born and reborn?" "Gautama! The Siddhas are eternal, and the Asiddhas are infinite in number." 231. 

Page #673:
---------------------------
## 162] [Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra Bhagavan! How long does an Asiddha, a Prasiddha, remain as such? Gautama! There are two types of Prasiddha Jivas: Anadi-A paryavasit and Anadi-Sapyaravasit. (Anadi-A paryavasit Prasiddha remains Prasiddha forever, and Anadi-Sapyaravasit remains in the Asiddha form until attaining liberation.) Bhagavan! What is the difference between a Siddha and a Prasiddha? Gautama! There is no difference between a Sadi-A paryavasit and a Prasiddha. Bhagavan! What is the difference between an Asiddha and a Prasiddha? Gautama! There is no difference between an Anadi-A paryavasit Prasiddha and an Anadi-Sapyaravasit Prasiddha. Bhagavan! Among these Siddhas and Prasiddhas, who is less, more, equal or superior to whom? Gautama! Siddhas are the fewest, and Prasiddhas are infinitely more numerous than them. 

**Explanation:** Just as nine types of Prathipattis are mentioned in the context of the Jivas who are involved in the ending of the world, similarly, nine Prathipattis are also mentioned in the context of all Jivas. All Jivas include both worldly and liberated Jivas. Therefore, all Jivas are included in these nine Prathipattis. These nine Prathipattis are as follows:

(1) Some say that all Jivas are of two types, namely Siddha and Prasiddha.
(2) Some say that all Jivas are of three types, namely Samyagdristi, Mithyadristi and Samyagmithyadristi.
(3) Some say that all Jivas are of four types, namely Manayogi, Vachanayogi, Kayayogi and Ayogi.
(4) Some say that all Jivas are of five types, namely Narayik, Tiryanch, Manushya, Deva and Siddha.
(5) Some say that all Jivas are of six types, namely Audarikashariri, Vaikriyasariri, Paharakashariri, Tejasashariri, Karmanashariri and Ashariri.
(6) Some say that all Jivas are of seven types, namely Prithvikaayik, Apkaayik, Tejaskaayik, Vayukaayik, Vanaspatikaayik, Traskaayik and Prakaayik.
(7) Some say that all Jivas are of eight types, namely Matijnani, Shrutajnani, Avadhijnani, Manahparyayajnani, केवलज्ञानी, Mati-Ajnani, Shruta-Ajnani and Vibhangajnani.
(8) Some say that all Jivas are of nine types, namely Ekeindriya, Dwiindriya, Triindriya, Chaturindriya, Nairyik, Tiryanch, Manushya, Deva and Siddha.
(9) Some say that all Jivas are of ten types, namely Prithvikaayik, Apkaayik, Tejaskaayik, Vayukaayik, Vanaspatikaayik, Dwiindriya, Triindriya, Chaturindriya, Panchendriya and Atiindriya.

From these nine Prathipattis, other distinctions have also been made with different interpretations, which will be mentioned in their respective places. Those who say that all Jivas are of two types, mean that all Jivas are included in these two categories: Siddha and Prasiddha. Those who have described eight types of bound karma...

"All beings are classified into two categories: Siddhas and Prasiddhas. Those who have completely shed the bonds of karma are Siddhas. Those who have not been freed from the bonds of the world and karma are Prasiddhas. Siddhas always remain immersed in their own nature, therefore their existence in time is not mentioned. Their state of being, i.e., their state of Siddhatva, remains forever. Siddhas are eternal and imperishable, meaning they have a beginning in Siddhatva and never cease to be Siddhas. There are two types of Prasiddhas: Anadi-Apayavasi and Anadi-Sapayavasi. Those who will never become Siddhas due to their being Abhavya or due to the influence of such material, are known as Anadi-Apayavasi Prasiddhas. Those who will attain Siddhi are Anadi-Sapayavasi, meaning they will end their endless cycle of birth and death. Until they attain liberation, they remain as Prasiddhas. Siddhas do not become Prasiddhas again after attaining Siddhatva, therefore there is no difference between them. They are eternal and imperishable, hence there is no difference. Among Prasiddhas, those who are Anadi-Apayavasi will never cease to be Prasiddhas, therefore there is no difference. Those who are Anadi-Sapayavasi also have no difference, because there is no rebirth after liberation. Siddhas are few in number, while Prasiddhas are infinite, because the number of Nigoda Jeevas is immense.

There are two categories of all beings, as follows: Saindhiya and Anidhiya.

"Bhagavan, how long does the Saindhiya state last?"

"Saindhiya is classified into two categories: Anadi-Apayavasi and Anadi-Sapayavasi.

"Anidhiya is classified into two categories: Sadi-Apayavasi and Sadi-Sapayavasi. There is a difference between the two.

"Anidhiya are countless, while Saindhiya are infinite.

There are two categories of all beings, as follows: Sakaiya and Akainya.

"Similarly, there are two categories of all beings: Sajogi and Ajoigi. Similarly, there are two categories of all beings: Salesa and Alesa. Similarly, there are two categories of all beings: Sasaroara and Prasaroara.

"The difference between these categories is due to the difference in the number of beings, as in the case of Saindhiya.

There are two categories of all beings, as follows: Savedaga and Avedaga.

"Bhagavan, how long does the Savedaga state last?"

"Savedaga is classified into three categories: Anadi-Apayavasi, Anadi-Sapayavasi, and Sadi-Sapayavasi.

"Among these, those who are Sadi-Sapayavasi will experience the end of their cycle of birth and death for an infinite period of time, until they attain the state of liberation and become a liberated soul.

"Bhagavan, how long does the Avedaga state last?"

"Avedaga is classified into two categories: Sadi-Apayavasi and Sadi-Sapayavasi.

"Among these, those who are Sadi-Sapayavasi will experience the end of their cycle of birth and death for a single period of time.

"Bhagavan, what is the difference in time between these states?"

"There is a difference in time for those who are Anadi-Apayavasi. There is no difference in time for those who are Anadi-Sapayavasi.

"Those who are Sadi-Sapayavasi will experience the end of their cycle of birth and death for a single period of time.

"Those who have shed the eight types of karma, which are bound and have been burnt to ashes, are Siddhas."

##  [165]  The two-fold understanding of Sarvajivaabhigam is presented in this sutra, with its various aspects. In the previous sutra, two distinctions were made based on Siddhatva and Prasiddhatva. This sutra explains the duality of Sarvajivaabhigam based on:

* **Indriya-Anindriya** (Sensory-Non-sensory)
* **Sakayik-Akayik** (With Body-Without Body)
* **Sayogi-Ayogi** (With Karma-Without Karma)
* **Seleshya-Aleshya** (With Body-Without Body)
* **Savaidaka-Avaidaka** (With Knowledge-Without Knowledge)
* **Sakshayik-Akshayik** (With Karma-Without Karma)

According to the commentator, the mention of Seleshya-Aleshya and Sasheera-Asheera comes after Sayogi-Ayogi, while the original text has a separate sutra for Seleshya-Aleshya at the end.

These two categories of Sarvajiva have **Upaadhi** (with attributes) and **Anupaadhikrit** (without attributes) distinctions. Due to **Karmajanaya-Upaadhi** (attributes arising from Karma), the sensory, with body, with karma, with body, with knowledge, and with karma beings are called **Samsari Jiva** (worldly beings). While those without Karmajanaya-Upaadhi are called **Siddh Jiva** (liberated beings) as they are non-sensory, without body, without karma, without body, without knowledge, and without karma.

The **Kayasthiti** (state of body) and **Antar** (difference) of the sensory should be explained according to the **Prasiddhatva** (known) and the **Anindriya** (non-sensory) should be explained according to the **Siddhatva** (liberated). It is as follows:

**"O Bhagavan! How long does the sensory being remain as sensory?"**

**"O Gautam! There are two types of sensory beings: Anaadi-Aparyavasit (eternal) and Anaadi-Saparyavasit (with beginning and end)."**

**"O Bhagavan! How long does the non-sensory being remain as non-sensory?"**

**"O Gautam! It is Saadi-Aparyavasit (eternal)."**

**"O Bhagavan! What is the difference between the sensory and non-sensory in terms of time?"**

**"O Gautam! There is no difference in Anaadi-Aparyavasit (eternal) and Anaadi-Saparyavasit (with beginning and end). There is no difference in Saadi-Aparyavasit (eternal)."**

**"What is the difference in the non-sensory?"**

**"O Gautam! There is no difference in Saadi-Aparyavasit (eternal)."**

The non-sensory are few in number, while the sensory are countless, as the sensory beings include the plant life, which is infinite.

Similarly, the **Kayasthiti** (state of body), **Antar** (difference), and **Alpbahutva** (fewness) of the beings with body, with karma, with body, with knowledge, and with karma should be explained in the same way as the sensory and non-sensory.

However, the **Savaidaka-Avaidaka** (with knowledge-without knowledge) and **Sakshayik-Akshayik** (with karma-without karma) have special characteristics and require separate explanation.

It is said that the **Savaidaka** (with knowledge) are of three types:

1. **Anaadi-Aparyavasit** (eternal)
2. **Anaadi-Saparyavasit** (with beginning and end)
3. **Saadi-Saparyavasit** (with beginning and end)

The **Anaadi-Aparyavasit** (eternal) **Savaidaka** (with knowledge) are either **Abhavy Jiva** (non-liberated beings) or those who will not attain liberation due to the lack of necessary materials. This is because many **Bhavy Jiva** (liberated beings) do not become **Siddh** (liberated).

The **Anaadi-Saparyavasit** (with beginning and end) **Savaidaka** (with knowledge) is a **Bhavy Jiva** (liberated being) who is on the path to liberation and has not yet attained the **Upshama Shreni** (stage of liberation).

The **Saadi-Saparyavasit** (with beginning and end) **Savaidaka** (with knowledge) is a **Bhavy Jiva** (liberated being) who is on the path to liberation and has already attained the **Upshama Shreni** (stage of liberation).

After attaining the **Upshama Shreni** (stage of liberation), they experience **Avaidakatva** (without knowledge) in the **Vedopshama** (stage of liberation) and die in the **Apantaaral** (interval between death and rebirth) due to **Bhavakshaya** (destruction of karma) or fall back from the **Upshama Shreni** (stage of liberation).

**"Bhaavaavi Na Sihjanti Kei"** (They do not attain liberation) - This is the statement. 

Page #677:
---------------------------
The *jiva* (soul) becomes aware (savadak) due to the *vedodaya* (awakening of knowledge) of the *jivajivaabhigamsutra* (the sutra on the interaction of souls). This aware *jiva* is *saadi-sapyavast* (having attained the state of *saadi* and *sapyavast*). The *kayasthiti* (state of being) of this *saadi-sapyavast* *savadak* is *jghanya* (inferior) and *antarmuhurt* (momentary). This is because after becoming aware at the end of the *shreni* (category), the *jiva* can again ascend the *shreni* and become unaware (*avedak*). There may be a doubt whether a *jiva* can attain the *upshamshreni* (category of liberation) twice in one birth. The solution is that the *upshamshreni* can be attained twice, but the *upshamshreni* and *kshapkasreni* (category of destruction) cannot be attained in one birth.

The *kayasthiti* of the *saadi-sapyavast* *savadak* is *utkarsh* (superior) and *anantakal* (eternal). This eternal state is *ananta* (infinite) *utsarpini-avsarpin* (ascending-descending) in terms of *kalamargna* (time-path) and *deshon* (region) *apardha-pudgal-paravart* (half-pudgala-reflection) in terms of *kshetramargna* (space-path). After this long period, the *jiva* who had attained the *upshamshreni* can attain the *shreni* and become *avedak* by becoming *aasannamukti* (near liberation).

There is no *sanchittana* (accumulation) for *anaadi-apyavast* (eternal unaware) and *anaadi-sapyavast* (eternal aware). When asked about the *avedak*, it is said that there are two types of *avedak*: *saadi-apyavast* (eternal unaware) with *kshinaved* (diminished knowledge) and *saadi-sapyavast* (eternal aware) with *upshantved* (quieted knowledge). The *sanchittana* of the *saadi-sapyavast* *avedak* is *jghanya* (inferior) and *ek samaya* (one time), which is the time of death after attaining the *upshamshreni* and *vedopshaman* (cessation of knowledge). The *utkarsh* (superior) is *antarmuhurt* (momentary), because the time of *upshamshreni* is only that much. After this, the *jiva* becomes *savadak* due to *patan* (fall).

There is no difference for the *anaadi-apyavast* *savadak*, because due to *apyavast* (eternal unaware), that state is never abandoned. There is also no difference for the *anaadi-sapyavast* *savadak*, because in the *anaadi-sapyavast* *apantaral* (eternal aware interval), the *jiva* does not attain the *upshamshreni* but becomes a future *kshinaved* (diminished knowledge). There is no possibility of the *kshinaved* becoming *savadak* again, because there is no *pratipat* (rebirth) in it. The difference for the *saadi-sapyavast* *savadak* is *jghanya* (inferior) and *ek samaya* (one time), because it is possible for someone to die after *vedopshaman* (cessation of knowledge) in the time after attaining the *upshamshreni* for the second time. The *utkarsh* (superior) is *antarmuhurt* (momentary), because after attaining the *upshamshreni* for the second time, it is possible to become *savadak* again after the *antarmuhurt* (momentary) time of the *shreni* ends.

In the *avedak sutra*, there is no difference for the *saadi-apyavast* *avedak*, because the *jiva* with *kshinaved* (diminished knowledge) does not become *savadak* again. The difference for the *saadi-sapyavast* *avedak* is *jghanya* (inferior) to *antarmuhurt* (momentary), because after becoming *savadak* at the end of the *upshamshreni*, it is possible to attain the *upshamshreni* for the second time in the *antarmuhurt* (momentary) and become *avedak*. The *utkarsh* (superior) difference is *anantakal* (eternal). That eternal state is *ananta* (infinite) *utsarpini-avsarpin* (ascending-descending) and *deshon* (region) *apardha-pudgal-paravart* (half-pudgala-reflection) in terms of *kshetramargna* (space-path), because after attaining the *upshamshreni* once and becoming *avedak* there, it is possible to attain the *shreni* again after such a long time and become *avedak* again after the end of the *shreni*.

One should know the *alp-bahutva* (few-many) of these, that is, the *avedak* are few and the *savadak* are infinite, in comparison to the infinity of *vanaspatijiva* (plant-life). 1. And also, according to the *moola-tika-kar* (original commentator): "The *upshamshreni* and *kshapkasreni* are not born in the same birth, but two *upshamshreni* can be born."

All beings are of two types: **Saksayik** and **Aksayik**. This is the same statement that should be made about **Svedak** and **Avedak**. 233. Or, all beings are of two types: **Gnani** and **Agnani**.  O Bhagavan! How long does a **Gnani** remain as a **Gnani**? Gautama! **Gnani** are of two types: **Sadi-Aparyavasit** and **Sadi-Sapyavasit**.  /  Of these, those who are **Sadi-Sapyavasit** can remain from the least **Antarmuhurt** to the most **Sadik** sixty-four **Sagaropama**.  /  The same statement applies to **Agnani** as was said for **Svedak**.  The difference for **Gnani** is from the least **Antarmuhurt** to the most **Anant** time, which is the form of **Deson Aparthpudgalparavart**.  /  There is no difference between the two **Agnani** - **Anadi-Aparyavasit** and **Anadi-Sapyavasit**. The difference for **Sadi-Sapyavasit** **Agnani** is from the least **Antarmuhurt** to the most **Sadik** sixty-four **Sagaropama**.  There are very few **Gnani**, and **Agnani** are countless times more. Or, all beings are of two types: **Sakar-Upayog** and **Aakar-Upayog**.  /  The difference in their **Sanchittana** and **Antar** is from the least to the most **Antarmuhurt**.  There are very few **Aakar-Upayog**, and **Sakar-Upayog** are countless times more. 233.  Discussion: This sutra describes the duality of all beings in relation to **Gnani** and **Agnani**.  Here, **Gnani** refers to **Samyaggnani**, and **Agnani** should be understood as **Mithyagnani**.  /  **Gnani** are of two types: **Sadi-Aparyavasit** and **Sadi-Sapyavasit**.  /  **Kevali** are **Sadi-Aparyavasit**, because **Kevalgyan** is **Sadi-Anant**.  /  **Matijnani** etc. are **Sadi-Sapyavasit**, because **Matijnani** etc. are **Sadi-Sant** due to their **Chhadmasthik** nature.  The **Sadi-Sapyavasit** **Gnani** can remain from the least **Antarmuhurt** to the most sixty-four **Sagaropama**.  The least state of **Samyaktva** is **Antarmuhurt**, and therefore the least state of the **Samyaktva**-possessing **Gnani** is **Antarmuhurt**.  The most time for **Samyagdarshan** is sixty-four 1. “**Samyagdrishteni Mithyadrishtviparayas**” - according to this statement.  /  

Page #679:
---------------------------
[168] The *Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra* is a little more than the *Sagaropama*, therefore the *Jnani's* excellent *Sanchittana* is said to be a little more than sixty-six *Sagaropama*. This situation is from the perspective of going to *Vijayadi* etc. without falling from *Samyaktva*. As it is said in the commentary, going to the *Vijayadi* plane twice or to the *Achyuta* heaven three times, the time of sixty-six *Sagaropama* and the time of human births is counted in the *Sadhika*, from which the said situation arises.

While describing the *Sanchiguna* of the *Agnani*, it is said that there are three types of *Agnani*... *Anadi-Aparyavasit*, *Anadi-Saparyavasit* and *Sadi-Saparyavasit*. The *Anadi-Aparyavasit* *Agnani* is one who will never go to *Moksha*. The *Anadi-Saparyavasit* *Agnani* is one who will attain *Samyaktva* with *Anadi-Mithyadristi* and will fall from it and attain the *Kshapaka* series. The *Sadi-Saparyavasit* *Agnani* is one who has become *Samyagdristi* and then become *Mithyadristi*. Such an *Agnani* can become *Samyagdristi* again after staying in it for a short time, from this perspective, his *Sanchittana* is said to be a short time and from the perspective of excellence, it is infinite time, which is in the form of infinite *Utsarpini* and *Avasarpini* and from the perspective of the field, it is *Deshon* *Aparthapudgalparavarta*.

The *Antardwar-Sadi-Aparyavasit* *Jnani* does not have a difference, because being *Aparyavasit*, he never abandons that form. The *Sadi-Saparyavasit* *Jnani* has a difference of a short time. He can become a *Jnani* again after staying in *Mithyadarshan* for that much time. From the perspective of excellence, it is infinite time (infinite *Utsarpini-Avasarpini* form), which is in the form of *Deshon* *Aparthapudgalparavarta*. Because the *Samyagdristi*, falling from *Samyaktva*, experiences *Mithyatva* for that much time and then surely attains *Samyaktva* again.

While describing the difference of the *Agnani*, it is said that the *Anadi-Aparyavasit* *Agnani* does not have a difference, because being *Aparyavasit*, he does not abandon that state. The *Anadi-Saparyavasit* *Agnani* also does not have a difference, because he does not go away upon attaining *Kevalgyan*. The *Sadi-Saparyavasit* *Agnani* has a short difference of a short time, because the time of short *Samyagdarshan* is only that much. From the perspective of excellence, the difference is sixty-six *Sagaropama*, because after falling from *Samyagdarshan*, he can remain an *Agnani* for that much time.

The *Alpबहुत्व* Sutra is clear. The *Agnani* is infinite times more than the *Jnani*. The *Agnani* *Vanaspatijiva* are infinite. Or, all beings have been divided into two categories based on their use. There are two types of use: *Sakar-Upayog* and *Anakar-Upayog*. Due to the duality of use, all beings are also of two types: those with *Sakar-Upayog* and those with *Anakar-Upayog*. The *Sanchittana* and difference of both of these, from both the perspective of short and excellence, is a short time. Here, the commentator writes that because the *Sattargati* is diverse, here, all beings should be taken as *Chhadmastha* only, not *Kevali*. Because the *Sakar-Anakar* use of *Kevali* is simultaneous, their *Kayasthiti* and *Antardwar* should also be said to be simultaneous, which is not said. It is said to be "a short time", which happens in *Chhadmastha*. 1. Two times *Vijayais* gone, three times *Achyue* heaven. _ In this way, human beings, various beings, all. _ _ -Commentary. 

Page #680:
---------------------------
[169. In the category of "Alpabahutva" (fewness), those with "Anaakar-upayog" (non-form use) are the fewest, because the duration of "Anaakar-upayog" is short, and they are obtained in small numbers at the time of inquiry. Those with "Saakar-upayog" (form use) are countless times more numerous, because the duration of "Saakar-upayog" is countless times longer than the duration of "Anaakar-upayog". 234. Alternatively, all beings are classified into two types: "Aaharga" (food-consuming) and "Anaaharga" (non-food-consuming).  O Venerable One! How long does an "Aaharga" remain as an "Aaharga"?  Gautama! "Aaharga" is classified into two types: "Chudmastha-Aaharga" (pseudo-food-consuming) and "Kevali-Aaharga" (fully-food-consuming).  /  O Venerable One! How long does a "Chudmastha-Aaharga" remain as an "Aaharga"?

170 [Jivajivaabhigamsutra Gautam! The difference between the least and the greatest duration of a *chhadmastha-paharak* is from a *kshullkabhav* (a very short time) to an *asankhyeyakal* (an immeasurable time), which is like an immeasurable part of an angul (finger) compared to the whole field. How long does a *kevali-paharak* last? Gautam! From the least, it lasts until the end of a *muhurt* (a period of time), and from the greatest, it lasts until the end of a *deshon-purvakoti* (a very long time). Bhagavan! How long does an *anaaharak* last? Gautam! There are two types of *anaaharaks* - *chhadmastha-anaaharaks* and *kevali-anaaharaks*. Bhagavan! How long does a *chhadmastha-anaaharak* last? Gautam! From the least, it lasts for one *samaya* (a period of time), and from the greatest, it lasts for two *samayas*. Kevali-anaaharaks are of two types - *siddhkevali-anaaharaks* and *bhavasthakevali-anaaharaks*. Bhagavan! How long does a *siddhkevali-anaaharak* last? Gautam! It is *sadi-aparyavasit* (without beginning or end). Bhagavan! How many types of *bhavasthakevali-anaaharaks* are there? Gautam!

From the least, it lasts for three *samayas* without any difference between the least and the greatest.

What is the difference between the least and the greatest duration of a *chhadmastha-paharak*? Gautam! From the least, it lasts for one *samaya*, and from the greatest, it lasts for two *samayas*. The difference between the least and the greatest duration of a *kevali-graharak* is three *samayas* without any difference between the least and the greatest. The difference between the least and the greatest duration of an *anaaharak* is from two *samayas* less than a *kshullkabhav* to an immeasurable time, which is like an immeasurable part of an angul compared to the whole field. A *siddhkevali-anaaharak* is *sadi-aparyavasit* (without beginning or end), so there is no difference. The difference between the least and the greatest duration of a *sayogibhavasthakevali-anaaharak* is the end of a *muhurt* from both the least and the greatest. There is no difference between the least and the greatest duration of an *ayogibhavasthakevali-anaaharak*. Bhagavan! Which of these *aaharaks* and *anaaharaks* are less, more, equal, or superior to each other? Gautam! The *anaaharaks* are the fewest, and the *aaharaks* are countless times more than them. Discussion - This sutra, which deals with *aaharaks* and *anaaharaks*, describes two types of all beings. Only *kevalis* who have attained *vigraha-gati-samapanna* (complete liberation), *kevali-samudghat* (complete knowledge), *ayogi-kevalis* and *siddh* are *anaaharaks*. All other beings are *aaharaks*. 1. *Vigraha-imavanna kevalino samuhya ayogi ya / Siddha ya pranahara, sesa paharagaa jivaa //* (Only *kevalis* who have attained *vigraha-gati-samapanna*, *ayogi* or *siddh* are *anaaharaks*.

##  All Living Beings' Approach to Food [171]

There are two types of living beings who consume food: **Chhadmastha-Yahaarak** (pseudo-eaters) and **Kevali-Grahaarak** (perfect eaters).

The lowest state of existence for a **Chhadmastha-Yahaarak** is **two moments of Kshullakbhav-grahan** (consumption of the subtle body). This is in comparison to the **Vigraha-Gati** (state of disintegration) where the being is born in the **Kshullakbhav** (subtle body).

In states like **Lokanishkut** (a state of existence), there are four or five moments of **Vigraha-Gati**, but most commonly, there are three moments. This is what the sutra refers to. Other ancient teachers have also said the same. As stated in the **Tattvarth Sutra**, "**Ek Dvau Va Anahaarakah**" (One or two are non-eaters).

Out of the three moments of **Vigraha-Gati**, two moments are **Anahaarak** (non-eating). Excluding those two moments, the being can remain a **Yahaarak** (eater) in the lowest form until **Kshullakbhav**. In the highest form, it can remain a **Yahaarak** for an **Asankhyeyakal** (incalculable time).

This **Asankhyeyakal** is a measure of **Asankhyey** (incalculable) **Utsarpini-Avasarpini** (ascending-descending cycles) and is a fraction of **Kshetra-Margna** (the measure of space). In other words, the number of **Utsarpini-Avasarpini** cycles is equal to the number of **Akasha-Pradesh** (space regions) in an **Angula-matra** (finger-width) multiplied by an **Asankhyey** (incalculable) number.

A being can be born in the **A-Vigraha** (non-disintegrated) form for such a long time, and in the **A-Vigraha** form, it is constantly a **Yahaarak** (eater).

The lowest state of existence for a **Kevali-Grahaarak** (perfect eater) is **Antarmuhurt** (a moment). This is in comparison to the **Antarkrit-Kevali** (internal perfect being). In the highest form, it is **Deshon-Purva-Koți** (a specific stage of spiritual development). This is in comparison to the **Purva-Koți** (a specific stage of spiritual development) where a being attains **Kevalgyan** (perfect knowledge) at the age of nine years.

There are two types of **Anahaarak** (non-eaters): **Chhadmastha-Anahaarak** (pseudo-non-eaters) and **Kevali-Anahaarak** (perfect non-eaters).

A **Chhadmastha-Anahaarak** can remain a **Anahaarak** for a minimum of one moment. This is in comparison to the **Vigraha-Gati** of two moments. In the highest form, it can remain a **Anahaarak** for two moments. This is in comparison to the **Vigraha-Gati** of three moments.

**Churnikaar** (a commentator) has said that although the **Bhavagati** (the scriptures) mentions **Anahaarak** for four moments, it is not accepted here because it is **Kadaachit** (occasional). The majority view is given precedence. Therefore, a **Chhadmastha-Anahaarak** can remain a **Anahaarak** for two moments.

There are two types of **Kevali-Anahaarak** (perfect non-eaters): **Bhav-Stha-Kevali-Anahaarak** (perfect non-eaters in the state of existence) and **Siddh-Kevali-Anahaarak** (perfect non-eaters who have attained liberation).

**Siddh-Kevali-Anahaarak** are **Sadi-A-Paryavasit** (beyond the cycle of birth and death). Since **Siddh** (liberated beings) are **Sadi-A-Paryavasit**, their **Anahaarak** (non-eating) is also **Sadi-A-Paryavasit**.

There are two types of **Bhav-Stha-Kevali-Anahaarak** (perfect non-eaters in the state of existence): **Sayogi-Bhav-Stha-Kevali-Anahaarak** (perfect non-eaters in the state of existence with karmic attachments) and **A-Yogi-Bhav-Stha-Kevali-Anahaarak** (perfect non-eaters in the state of existence without karmic attachments).

An **A-Yogi-Bhav-Stha-Kevali-Anahaarak** can remain a **Anahaarak** for a minimum of **Antarmuhurt** (a moment) and a maximum of **Antarmuhurt** (a moment). **A-Yogitva** (lack of karmic attachments) occurs in the **Shaileshi-Avastha** (a specific state of existence). In this state, the being is naturally a **Anahaarak** (non-eater) because **Praudarik-Kay-Yog** (karmic attachments related to the physical body) does not exist at that time.

The duration of the **Shaileshi-Avastha** is a minimum of **Antarmuhurt** (a moment) and a maximum of **Antarmuhurt** (a moment). However, it is important to understand that the **Utkrisht-Pad** (higher state) is more significant than the **Jghanya-Pad** (lower state). Otherwise, there would be no need to mention both states.

1. "**Ek Dvau Va Anahaarakah**" - **Tattvarth Sutra**, Chapter 2, Sutra 31
2. "Although the **Bhavagati** mentions **Anahaarak** for four moments, it is not accepted here because it is **Kadaachit** (occasional). The majority view is given precedence. Therefore, a **Chhadmastha-Anahaarak** can remain a **Anahaarak** for two moments." - **Vriti** (commentary)

173. The Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra states that a Sayogi-Bhav-Sthakevali who is an Anaharaka can remain in the state of Jghana and Utkarhsa for three times without any difference. This is because in the third, fourth, and fifth times of the Asht-Samayik Kevali-Samudghat, only Karman-Kayayoga occurs. Therefore, in those three times, he is an Anaharaka by rule. The difference between Antar-Dwar-Chhadmasth-Anaharaka and Jghana is one time, and the difference between Antar-Dwar-Chhadmasth-Anaharaka and Utkarhsa is two times. The duration of the Chhadmasth-Anaharaka is the same as the duration of the Chhadmasth-Paharak. This duration is one time from Jghana and two times from Utkarhsa. Therefore, the difference between Chhadmasth-Paharak and Jghana is one time, and the difference between Chhadmasth-Paharak and Utkarhsa is two times. The difference between Kevali-Anaharaka and Ajghana-Utkarhsa is three times. Kevali-Anaharaka is a Sayogi-Bhav-Sthakevali. His Anaharakatva is for three times, as mentioned earlier. The difference between Kevali-Paharak and Kevali-Anaharaka is also three times. The difference between Chhadmasth-Anaharaka and Jghana is two times less than the Ksullak-Bhav, and the difference between Chhadmasth-Anaharaka and Utkarhsa is countless times or countless parts of an Angul. This has been explained earlier. The duration of the Chhadmasth-Paharak is the same as the difference between Chhadmasth-Anaharaka and Jghana. There is no difference between Siddha-Kevali-Anaharaka and Jghana because it is Sadi-A-Paryavasit. The difference between Sayogi-Bhav-Sthakevali-Anaharaka and Jghana is Antar-Muhurt, and the difference between Sayogi-Bhav-Sthakevali-Anaharaka and Utkarhsa is also Antar-Muhurt. This is because after performing Kevali-Samudghat, the state of Shaileshi is attained within Antar-Muhurt. Here also, one should understand that the Utkarhsa-pad is more special than the Jghana-pad. There is no difference between A-Yogi-Bhav-Sthakevali-Anaharaka and Jghana because all are Anaharaka in the A-Yogi state. There is no difference between Siddhas and Jghana because they are Sadi-A-Paryavasit. The least number of Anaharakas are those who are Siddhas, Vigraha-Gati-Samapannak, Samudghat-Gat-Kevali, and A-Yogi-Kevali. The number of Anaharakas is countless times less than the number of Aharakas. There might be a doubt that the number of Vanaspati-Jivas is countless times more than the number of Siddhas, and they are mostly Aharakas, so why is it not said that the number of Aharakas is countless times more? The answer is that countless parts of the Prati-Nigo-D are always in Vigraha-Gati every time, and Jivas are Anaharakas in Vigraha-Gati. Therefore, the number of Aharakas is countless times more, not countless times less. Here, information about Ksullak-Bhav is given in the Vritti. It is being given here because it is useful. Ksullak-Bhav means small or little. The reception of the smallest Bhav (the time of sensation of a small lifespan) is Ksullak-Bhav-Grahan. According to the standards of Pravalikas, it is two hundred and fifty-six Pravalikas. There are slightly more than seventeen Ksullak-Bhav in one breath. There are sixty-five thousand five hundred Ksullak-Bhav in one Muhurt.

## Translation:

**All living beings (Sarvajivas) are of 65,536 (65,536) types of Kṣullakabhavas.**  

**There are 3,773 breaths (Pānāprāṇa) in one Muhūrta.**  

**By the rule of three, 17 Kṣullakabhavas are obtained in one breath.**  

**Dividing 65,536 by 3,773, we get the number of Bhavas in one breath. The quotient is 17 and the remainder is 1394, which has slightly more than 94 Pravalikās.**  

**If we want to know the number of Pravalikās in one breath, we should multiply 17 by 256 and add the above 94 Pravalikās, which gives us 4,446 Pravalikās.**  

**If we want to know the number of Pravalikās in one Muhūrta, we should multiply these 4,446 Pravalikās of one breath by the number of breaths in one Muhūrta, which is 3,773, giving us 167,74,758 Pravalikās.**  

**Adding 2,458 more Pravalikās to this, we get 167,77,216 Pravalikās in one Muhūrta.**  

**Alternatively, we can multiply the 65,536 Kṣullakabhavas of a Muhūrta by the 256 Pravalikās of one Bhava to get the number of Pravalikās in one Muhūrta.**  

**Therefore, it is appropriate to say that there are countless Pravalikās in one breath.**  

**235. Alternatively, all living beings are of two types: Sabhāṣaka and Abhāṣaka.**  

**O Bhagavan! How long does a Sabhāṣaka remain as a Sabhāṣaka?**  

**Gautama! From the lowest, one time, and from the highest, one Antarmuhūrta.**  

**1. Twenty-two thousand five hundred are sixty-six. These are the Kṣullakabhavas in one Antarmuhūrta.**  

**2. Three thousand seven hundred seventy-three are the breaths. This is the Muhūrta, said by all the omniscient ones.**  

**3. One crore seventy-seven lakhs seventy-three thousand two hundred sixteen are the Pravalikās in one Muhūrta.**  

**O Bhagavan! What about Abhāṣaka?**  

**Gautama! Abhāṣaka is of two types: Sāīya and Apajjavasīya.**  

**O Bhagavan! How long is the difference between Sabhāṣaka and Abhāṣaka?**  

**Gautama! From the lowest, one time, and from the highest, one Antarmuhūrta.**  

**O Bhagavan! How long does a Sāīya Apajjavasīya Abhāṣaka remain as an Abhāṣaka?**  

**Gautama! From the lowest, one time, and from the highest, one Antarmuhūrta.**  

**O Bhagavan! How long does a Sāīya Sapajjavasīya Abhāṣaka remain as an Abhāṣaka?**  

**Gautama! From the lowest, one time, and from the highest, an infinite time. The time of their birth and death is infinite.**  

**O Bhagavan! How long is the difference between Sabhāṣaka and Abhāṣaka?**  

**Gautama! From the lowest, one time, and from the highest, an infinite time.**  

**The difference between Sāīya Apajjavasīya and Sāīya Sapajjavasīya is that the former remains as an Abhāṣaka for one time, while the latter remains as an Abhāṣaka for an infinite time.**  

**There are many types of Sabhāṣaka and Abhāṣaka, and Abhāṣaka is infinite times more than Sabhāṣaka.**  

**Alternatively, all living beings are of two types: Sasarīrī and Asarīrī.**  

**Asarīrī are like Siddhas.**  

**Sasarīrī are like Asiddhas.**  

**There are many types of Asarīrī and Sasarīrī, and Asarīrī is infinite times more than Sasarīrī.**

174) [Jiva-jiva-abhigamsutra Bhanta! Prabhashaka, how long does a Prabhashaka remain as a Prabhashaka? Gautama! Prabhashaka is of two types: Paryavasita and Sadi-saparyavasita. / Of these, the Sadi-saparyavasita Prabhashaka remains as an Abhashaka from the lowest, Antarmuhurta, to the highest, Anantakal, that is, for the entire Ananta Utsarpini-Avasarpini kal, that is, for the entire Vanaspatikal. / Bhagavan!

[All beings are accessible] [175 One should know the statement of the embodied and disembodied as proven and well-known. 236. Or, all beings are of two types, namely, charma and acharma / O Bhagavan! How long does charma remain in the charma state? Gautama! Charma is anadi-saparyavasit. Acharma is of two types: anadi-aparyavasit and sadi-aparyavasit / There is no difference between the two. In terms of alpabahutva, acharma is the least, and charma is infinitely more numerous than them. (This is the complete understanding of the two types of all beings.) Discussion: The two types of all beings, charma and acharma, are described in this sutra / The special bhavyas who will become siddhas are called charma. Those who are opposite to them are called acharma. These acharma are abhavyas and siddhas / In the kayasthiti sutra, charma is anadi-saparyavasit, otherwise it cannot be called charma. In the acharma sutra, acharma is of two types: anadi-aparyavasit and sadi-aparyavasit / Anadi-aparyavasit-acharma is the abhavyas, and sadi-aparyavasit-acharma is the siddhas. There is no difference between the two in the antaradwar. There is no difference between anadi-saparyavasit-charma, because once charmatva is attained, it is not possible to attain it again. Whether acharma is anadi-aparyavasit or sadi-aparyavasit, there is no difference, because they do not attain charmatva. In the alpabahutva sutra, acharma is the least, because only abhavyas and siddhas are acharma. Charma is infinitely more numerous than them. This statement should be understood in relation to the general bhava, otherwise it cannot be infinitely more numerous / As the original commentator has said: "Charma is infinitely more numerous / This should be understood in relation to the general bhavyas. The subject division of the sutras is difficult to understand." Thus, the various understandings regarding all beings are complete. The verse that summarizes the two types of statements mentioned here is as follows: Siddhasaindiyakae joae veae kasayalesa ya / Nanuvogaahara bhasasariri ya charamo ya / / Its meaning is clear. 1. "Charma is infinitely more numerous, this should be understood in relation to the general bhavyas. The subject division of the sutras is difficult to understand."]

The difference between **Samyak** and **Mithyatva** दृष्टि is very subtle, ranging from a mere moment to an eternity. This difference is expressed in terms of **Deshon Aparadh Pudgal Paravart**.

There are very few **Samyak-Mithyatva** दृष्टि, compared to **Samyak** दृष्टि, which are infinitely more numerous. **Mithyatva** दृष्टि are infinitely more numerous than **Samyak** दृष्टि.

There are three types of **Jivas**: **Samyak** दृष्टि, **Mithyatva** दृष्टि, and **Samyak-Mithyatva** दृष्टि. Their nature has been explained earlier. Here, we discuss their **Kayasthiti** (state of being), difference, and relative abundance.

**Kayasthiti**: **Samyak** दृष्टि are of two types: **Sadi-Aperyavasit** (**Kshayik Samyak** दृष्टि) and **Sadi-Sapyavasit** (**Kshayopa-shaamik** etc. **Samyak** दृष्टि). The **Sadi-Sapyavasit** **Samyak** दृष्टि have a **Kayasthiti** that lasts from a moment to a maximum of sixty-four **Sagaropama** (a unit of time). This is because due to the varied **Karma** results, a **Jiva** can fall into **Mithyatva** after this period. After this, **Kshayopa-shaamik** **Samyak** दृष्टि does not persist.

**Mithyatva** दृष्टि are of three types: **Anadi-Aperyavasit**, **Anadi-Sapyavasit**, and **Sadi-Sapyavasit**. The **Sadi-Sapyavasit** **Mithyatva** दृष्टि lasts from a moment to an eternity. After this period, a **Jiva** can attain **Samyak** दृष्टि again. This eternity is **Anant Utsarpini-Avapini** in terms of **Kalmarg-na** and **Deshon Aparadh Pudgal Paravart** in terms of **Kshetramarg-na**. This is because a **Jiva** who has attained **Samyak** once, will inevitably attain it again after this period. Due to the influence of previous **Samyak** दृष्टि, they have renounced the world.

**Samyak-Mithyatva** दृष्टि lasts from a moment to a moment, as this is the natural duration of **Mishradristi**. Only the difference between the lowest and highest states is greater.

**Antar** (difference): **Sadi-Aperyavasit** **Samyak** दृष्टि has no difference, as it is **Aperyavasit**. The difference of **Sadi-Sapyavasit** **Samyak** दृष्टि is from a moment to an eternity, as a **Jiva** can attain **Samyak** दृष्टि again within a moment after falling from it.

**Anadi-Aperyavasit** **Mithyatva** दृष्टि has no difference, as its **Mithyatva** never ends. **Anadi-Sapyavasit** **Mithyatva** also has no difference, as it loses its **Anadi** nature when it ends and begins again. The difference of **Sadi-Sapyavasit** **Mithyatva** दृष्टि is from a moment to sixty-four **Sagaropama**, as the duration of **Samyak** दृष्टि is usually the difference of **Mithyatva** दृष्टि. The lowest and highest duration of **Samyak** दृष्टि is the same.

The difference of **Samyak-Mithyatva** दृष्टि is a moment, as a **Jiva** can attain **Samyak-Mithyatva** दृष्टि again within a moment after falling from it. The highest difference is **Deshon Aparadh Pudgal Paravart**.

## All Beings (Sarva Jivaabhigam)

There are two types of worldly transmigration (Samsara-Praparitta):

* **Anaadi-Aaparyavasit:** Without beginning and without end.
* **Anaadi-Saaparyavasit:** Without beginning but with an end.

There is also **No-Paritta-No-Aparitta**, which is without beginning and without end.

**Kaaya-Paritta** (limited body) has a minimum duration of an **Antarmuhurta** (a very short time) and a maximum duration of a **Vanaspatikala** (the lifespan of a plant). **Samsara-Paritta** (limited worldly transmigration) has no duration.

**Kaaya-Aparitta** (unlimited body) has a minimum duration of an **Antarmuhurta** and a maximum duration of **Asankhyeya Kala** (an immeasurable time, equivalent to the lifespan of the Earth).

**Anaadi-Aaparyavasit Samsara-Paritta** has no duration.

**Anaadi-Saaparyavasit Samsara-Paritta** has no duration.

**No-Paritta-No-Aparitta** also has no duration.

**Alp-Bahutva** (the number of beings) is the least for **Paritta**, infinite for **No-Paritta-No-Aparitta**, and infinite for **Aparitta**.

**Considering other aspects, all worldly beings are of three types:**

* **Paritta:** Limited.
* **Aparitta:** Unlimited.
* **No-Paritta-No-Aparitta:** Neither limited nor unlimited.

**Paritta** generally means limited. Beings who have limited their worldly transmigration and their ordinary plant body are called **Paritta**.

**Aparitta** are the opposite, and **Siddha-Jiva** (liberated beings) are **No-Paritta-No-Aparitta**.

This sutra discusses the **Kaaya-Sthiti** (body state), **Antar** (duration), and **Alp-Bahutva** (number) of these three types of beings.

**Kaaya-Sthiti** (body state) of **Paritta** is of two types:

* **Kaaya-Paritta:** Each body.
* **Samsara-Paritta:** Whose worldly transmigration period is within the **Aapardha-Pudgala-Paravarta** (half the time of the rotation of the universe).

**Paritta** can remain in **Kaaya-Paritta** from a minimum of **Antarmuhurta** to a maximum of **Asankhyeya Kala**. This **Asankhyeya Kala** is equivalent to the time taken for an immeasurable number of **Utsapini-Avasapini** (ascending and descending) forms to become **Nirlepa** (free from karmic matter) by removing one **Aakash-Pradesha** (celestial region) from an immeasurable number of **Lokas** (worlds) at each moment. Or, it can be said that it is equivalent to the time taken for the **Sanchittana** (accumulation) of the **Prithvi-Kaya** (earth body) and all other bodies. After this, they are born in an ordinary form according to the law.

**Samsara-Paritta** can remain in the same form from a minimum of **Antarmuhurta** to a maximum of **Ananta Kala** (infinite time). This **Ananta Kala** is equivalent to the time taken for an infinite number of **Utsapini-Avasapini** forms to become **Nirlepa** by removing **Aapardha-Pudgala-Paravarta** from the universe. After this, they attain **Siddhi** (liberation) according to the law. Otherwise, **Samsara-Paritta** has no meaning.

**Aparitta** are of two types:

* **Kaaya-Aparitta:** Ordinary plant beings.
* **Samsara-Aparitta:** **Krishnapakshika** (beings who are in the dark fortnight of their life cycle).

**Kaaya-Aparitta** can remain in the same form from a minimum of **Antarmuhurta** to a maximum of **Ananta Kala**. This **Ananta Kala** is the lifespan of a plant, which has been explained earlier using **Kala-Margna** (time path) and **Kshetra-Margna** (space path).

**Samsara-Aparitta** are of two types:

* **Anaadi-Aaparyavasit:** Who will never attain liberation.
* **Anaadi-Saaparyavasit (Bhavya Vishesh):** Who will attain liberation.

## Translation:

**10]** The **No-Uparyatta-No-Aparyatta** is a **Siddha** (liberated) being. It is **Anadi-Aparyavasita** (beginningless and endless), because there is no **Pratyapat** (rebirth) from it. The difference between **Antardvara-Kaya-Uparyatta** and **Antardvara-Kaya-Aparyatta** is from **Jghanya** (lowest) to **Antarmuhurta** (a very short time). In the case of **Sadharana** (ordinary beings), it can remain for **Antarmuhurta** and then be found again in every **Shariri** (body). From **Utkarsha** (highest), it should be understood as **Vanaspatikaal** (the time of plants) for an infinite period. It can remain in the **Sadharana** form for that long. There is no difference in **Sansara-Uparyatta**. Because, after being freed from **Sansara-Uparyatta**, there is no **Sansara-Uparyatta** again, and there is no **Pratyapat** of the liberated being. The difference between **Kaya-Aparyatta** is from **Jghanya** to **Antarmuhurta**. It is possible to find it in every **Shariri** for **Antarmuhurta** and then again in **Kaya-Aparyatta**. From **Utkarsha**, there is a difference of **Asankhyeya** (innumerable) time. This **Asankhyeya** time is **Prithvi Kaal** (earth time). Its explanation has been done before in **Kaalmarggana** and **Kshetramarggana**. The time of wandering in **Prithvi** and other **Shariri** births is the same from **Utkarsha**. 

Those who are **Anadi-Aparyavasita** in **Sansara-Aparyatta** have no difference, because they are **Aparyavasita**. And there is no difference in **Anadi-Saparyavasita** either, because after leaving **Sansara-Aparyatta**, it is not possible to have **Sansara-Aparyatta** again. There is also no difference in **No-Uparyatta-No-Aparyatta**, because they are **Anadi-Aparyavasita**. **Alpबहुत्वद्वार** are the smallest **Uparyatta**, because **Karma-Uparyatta** and **Sansara-Uparyatta** beings are few. They are **Anantguna** (infinite times) more than **No-Uparyatta-No-Aparyatta**, because **Siddha** beings are infinite. They are **Anantguna** more than **Aparyatta**, because **Krishnapakshika** (dark side) are **Atiprabhut** (very abundant).

**239.** Or, there are three types of **Jiva** (soul): **Paryaptak** (sufficient), **Aparyaptak** (insufficient), and **No-Uparyaptak-No-Aparyaptak**. 

**Gautama!** How long does a **Paryaptak** remain as a **Paryaptak**? 

**Gautama!** It can remain from **Jghanya** to **Antarmuhurta** and from **Utkarsha** to **Sadhika Sagaropama Shatapruthaktva** (two hundred to nine hundred **Sagaropama**).

**Gautama!** How long can an **Aparyaptak** remain as an **Aparyaptak**? 

**Gautama!** It can remain from **Jghanya** to **Antarmuhurta** and from **Utkarsha** to **Antarmuhurta**.

**Gautama!** **No-Uparyaptak-No-Aparyaptak** are **Aparyavasita** (endless).

**Gautama!** What is the difference between them?

**Gautama!** The difference between **Paryaptak** is from **Jghanya** to **Antarmuhurta** and from **Utkarsha** to **Antarmuhurta**. The difference between **Aparyaptak** is from **Jghanya** to **Antarmuhurta** and from **Utkarsha** to **Sadhika Sagaropama Shatapruthaktva**. This is the difference between them.

**Gautama!** **No-Uparyaptak-No-Aparyaptak** are **Appabahu** (very few) everywhere, **Aparyaptak** are **Anantguna** (infinite times) more, and **Paryaptak** are **Sankhyajguna** (countable times) more. 

Page #692:
---------------------------
All living beings are classified into three categories: **Paryāptaka**, **Aparyāptaka**, and **Noparyāptaka-Noaparyāptaka**.  

**Lord! What is the duration of a Paryāptaka?**

**Gautama!** The duration of a Paryāptaka is from a **jighnya antarmūhurta** to an **utkṛṣṭa antarmūhurta**. The duration of an **Aparyāptaka** is from a **jighnya antarmūhurta** to an **utkṛṣṭa sādika sāgaropam-śatapṛthaktva**. The duration of a **Noparyāptaka-Noaparyāptaka** is **not defined**.

**There are very few Noparyāptaka-Noaparyāptaka, Aparyāptaka are countless times more, and Paryāptaka are countless times more than Aparyāptaka.**

**Explanation:**

The **kāya-sthiti** of a Paryāptaka is a **jighnya antarmūhurta**. It is the time spent in the Paryāptaka state after being born from an Aparyāptaka and before being reborn as an Aparyāptaka. The **utkṛṣṭa kāya-sthiti** is from two hundred to nine hundred **sāgaropam** plus some. After this, the birth in the **Aparyāptaka** form takes place according to the rules. This statement is with respect to the **labdhi** (attainment). Therefore, even if there is **upapāta Aparyāptakatva** (temporary Aparyāptakatva) in the **apāntarāla** (intermediate period), there is no fault.

The **kāya-sthiti** of an **Aparyāptaka** is from a **jighnya antarmūhurta** to an **utkṛṣṭa antarmūhurta** because the duration of **Aparyāptaka-labdhi** (attainment of Aparyāptaka state) is only this much.

The **utkṛṣṭa** (highest) state is greater than the **jighnya** (lowest) state. **Noparyāptaka-Noaparyāptaka** are **siddh** (liberated) and **sādika-aparyavasita** (unchanging). Therefore, they remain in the same form forever.

The duration of a **Paryāptaka** is from a **jighnya antarmūhurta** to an **utkṛṣṭa antarmūhurta** because the duration of **Aparyāptaka-kāla** (time spent as an Aparyāptaka) is the duration of a **Paryāptaka**.

The duration of **Aparyāptaka-kāla** is from a **jighnya antarmūhurta** to an **utkṛṣṭa antarmūhurta**. The **jighnya antara** (lowest difference) of an **Aparyāptaka** is an **antarmūhurta**, and the **utkṛṣṭa antara** (highest difference) is a **sādika sāgaropam-śatapṛthaktva**.

The duration of a **Paryāptaka** is the difference between **Aparyāptaka**, and the duration of a **Paryāptaka** is from a **jighnya antarmūhurta** to an **utkṛṣṭa sādika sāgaropam-śatapṛthaktva**.

The difference between **Noparyāptaka-Noaparyāptaka** is **not defined** because they are **siddh** (liberated) and **aparyavasita** (unchanging).

There are very few **Noparyāptaka-Noaparyāptaka** because **siddh jīva** (liberated souls) are fewer than other souls. **Aparyāptaka** are countless times more because **nigoda jīva** (souls in the lower realms) always have countless **Aparyāptaka**. **Paryāptaka** are countless times more than **Aparyāptaka** because there are countless **Paryāptaka** in the **oha** (stream of existence) of **sūkṣma** (subtle) beings.

[182] The lifespan of a Jiva (living being) with a subtle body (Sūkṣma) ranges from a very short duration (Antarmūhurta) to an immeasurable period of time (Asankhyeya Kāla), which is equivalent to the lifespan of the Earth. Similarly, the lifespan of a Jiva with a gross body (Bādar) ranges from a very short duration (Antarmūhurta) to an immeasurable period of time (Asankhyeya Kāla). This immeasurable period of time (Asankhyeya Kāla) is equivalent to the duration of countless cycles of ascending (Utsarpini) and descending (Avasarpini) time periods (Kāla Mārgṇā). In terms of spatial measurement (Kṣetra Mārgṇā), it is equivalent to an immeasurable fraction of an Angula (finger width). The lifespan of a Jiva with neither a subtle nor a gross body (No Sūkṣma-No Bādar) is infinite (Sādi-A Paryavasita). The difference between the lifespan of a Jiva with a subtle body (Sūkṣma) and a Jiva with a gross body (Bādar) is a period of time equivalent to the lifespan of a Jiva with a gross body (Bādar). Similarly, the difference between the lifespan of a Jiva with a gross body (Bādar) and a Jiva with a subtle body (Sūkṣma) is a period of time equivalent to the lifespan of a Jiva with a subtle body (Sūkṣma). There is no difference in the lifespan of a Jiva with neither a subtle nor a gross body (No Sūkṣma-No Bādar) because their lifespan is infinite (A Paryavasita). The number of Jivas with neither a subtle nor a gross body (No Sūkṣma-No Bādar) is the smallest, followed by Jivas with a gross body (Bādar) which are infinitely more numerous, and finally Jivas with a subtle body (Sūkṣma) which are immeasurably more numerous. Based on the nature of their bodies (Kāya Sthiti), there are three types of Jivas: those with a subtle body (Sūkṣma), those with a gross body (Bādar), and those with neither a subtle nor a gross body (No Sūkṣma-No Bādar). This sūtra (aphorism) explains the nature of their bodies (Kāya Sthiti), the difference in their lifespans (Antara), and their relative abundance (Alp Bahutva). The lifespan of a Jiva with a subtle body (Sūkṣma) ranges from a very short duration (Antarmūhurta) to an immeasurable period of time (Asankhyeya Kāla). After this immeasurable period of time (Asankhyeya Kāla), they can be reborn as Jivas with a gross body (Bādar). The lifespan of a Jiva with a gross body (Bādar) ranges from a very short duration (Antarmūhurta) to an immeasurable period of time (Asankhyeya Kāla). After this immeasurable period of time (Asankhyeya Kāla), they can be reborn as Jivas with a subtle body (Sūkṣma). This immeasurable period of time (Asankhyeya Kāla) is equivalent to the duration of countless cycles of ascending (Utsarpini) and descending (Avasarpini) time periods (Kāla Mārgṇā). In terms of spatial measurement (Kṣetra Mārgṇā), it is equivalent to the time it takes for an immeasurable number of Lokākāśa (space) regions, each the size of an Angula (finger width), to be completely emptied of all Jivas. This is known as the lifespan of the Earth (Pṛthvī Kāla). The lifespan of a Jiva with a gross body (Bādar) ranges from a very short duration (Antarmūhurta) to an immeasurable period of time (Asankhyeya Kāla). After this immeasurable period of time (Asankhyeya Kāla), they can be reborn as Jivas with a subtle body (Sūkṣma). This immeasurable period of time (Asankhyeya Kāla) is equivalent to the duration of countless cycles of ascending (Utsarpini) and descending (Avasarpini) time periods (Kāla Mārgṇā). In terms of spatial measurement (Kṣetra Mārgṇā), it is equivalent to an immeasurable fraction of an Angula (finger width). After this period of time, a worldly Jiva is regularly reborn as a Jiva with a subtle body (Sūkṣma). Jivas with neither a subtle nor a gross body (No Sūkṣma-No Bādar) are liberated souls (Siddh Jīva) and remain in their state forever (Sādi-A Paryavasita). The difference in the lifespan of a Jiva with a subtle body (Sūkṣma) ranges from a very short duration (Antarmūhurta) to an immeasurable period of time (Asankhyeya Kāla). This immeasurable period of time (Asankhyeya Kāla) is equivalent to an immeasurable fraction of an Angula (finger width). The difference in the lifespan of a Jiva with a gross body (Bādar) is the same. The difference in the lifespan of a Jiva with a gross body (Bādar) ranges from a very short duration (Antarmūhurta) to an immeasurable period of time (Asankhyeya Kāla). This immeasurable period of time (Asankhyeya Kāla) is equivalent to an immeasurable number of Lokas (worlds). There is no difference in the lifespan of a Jiva with neither a subtle nor a gross body (No Sūkṣma-No Bādar) because their lifespan is infinite (Sādi-A Paryavasita). Because their lifespan is infinite (A Paryavasita), there is no difference in their lifespan. The number of Jivas with neither a subtle nor a gross body (No Sūkṣma-No Bādar) is the smallest because liberated souls (Siddh Jīva) are less numerous than other Jivas. Jivas with a gross body (Bādar) are infinitely more numerous because Jivas with a gross body (Bādar) are infinitely more numerous than liberated souls (Siddh Jīva). Jivas with a subtle body (Sūkṣma) are immeasurably more numerous because Jivas with a subtle body (Sūkṣma) are immeasurably more numerous than Jivas with a gross body (Bādar). 241. There are three types of Jivas: those with a subtle body (Saṇṇī), those with a gross body (Asaṇṇī), and those with neither a subtle nor a gross body (No Saṇṇī-No Asaṇṇī). O Venerable One! How long is the lifespan of a Jiva with a subtle body (Saṇṇī)? It ranges from a very short duration (Antarmūhurta

[All beings are approached] [183 Appabahuyam-Savvasthova Sapani, Nosanni-Noasani Anantgana, Asani Anantgana. 241. Alternatively, all beings are of three types: Sanji, Asanji, Nosanji-Togsangi. Bhagavan! How long does a Sanji being remain in the Sanji state? Gautama! From the lowest, it remains for a time slightly longer than an Antarmuhurt, and from the highest, for a time slightly longer than a Sagaropama Shataprithaktva. / Asanji, from the lowest, remains for an Antarmuhurt, and from the highest, for a time equal to the lifespan of a plant. / Nosanji-Noasani is Sadi-Aperyavasit, therefore it remains forever. The difference in Sanji is between the lowest Antarmuhurt and the highest lifespan of a plant. / The difference in Asanji is between the lowest Antarmuhurt and the highest Sadik Sagaropama Shataprithaktva. / There is no difference in Nosanji-Noasani. In terms of Alpabahutva, Sanji beings are the fewest, Nosanji-Noprasanji beings are infinitely more numerous than them, and Asanji beings are infinitely more numerous than them. Discussion-Sanji, Asanji, by explaining the diversity of beings in this sutra, their Sanchittana, difference, and Alpabahutva are stated. / Kayasthiti (Sanchittana)-Sanji can remain in the same form from the lowest Antarmuhurt. After this, it can again go into the Asanji beings. From the highest, it can remain for a time between two hundred Sagaropama and nine hundred Sagaropama. / After this, the Samsari being is definitely born in the Prasanji state. The Kayasthiti of Asanji is the lowest Antarmuhurt. After this, it can again be born in the Sanji beings. From the highest, it can remain in the Asanji beings for an infinite time. This infinite time is the lifespan of a plant. From the perspective of Kalmarganga, there are infinite Utsarpini-Avasarpini forms, and from the perspective of Kshetramarganga, there are infinite Lokas and countless Pudgalparavarta forms. / The proof of those Pudgalparavarta is equal to the countless parts of the Pavalika time. Nosanji-Noasani beings are Siddhas. They are Sadi-Aperyavasit. / Being Aperyavasit, they remain in the same form forever. Antaradwar-The difference in Sanji is the lowest Antarmuhurt and the highest is infinite time, which is equal to the lifespan of a plant. / The time of existence of Asanji is the same from the lowest to the highest. _ The difference in Asanji is between the lowest Antarmuhurt and the highest Sadik Sagaropama Shataprithaktva, because the time of existence of Sanji is the same from the lowest to the highest. / _ There is no difference in Nosanji-Noasani, because they are Sadi-Aperyavasit. Being Aperyavasit, there is no difference. Alpabahutvadwar-Sanji beings are the fewest, because Devas, Narakas, and Garbhavyutkrantik Tiryanch and Manusya are the only Sanji beings. / Nosanji-Noprasanji beings are infinitely more numerous than them, because Siddhas are infinitely more numerous than all beings except plants, and Asanji beings are infinitely more numerous than them, because plant beings are infinitely more numerous than Siddhas. /

## 184] [Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra 242. There are three types of Jivas: Bhava-siddh, Abhava-siddh, and No-Bhava-siddh-No-Abhava-siddh. Bhava-siddh Jivas are Anadi-Saparyavasit (beginningless and ending), Abhava-siddh Jivas are Anadi-Aparyavasit (beginningless and unending), and No-Bhava-siddh-No-Abhava-siddh Jivas are Sadi-Aparyavasit (beginning and unending). There is no difference between these three. In terms of quantity, Abhava-siddh Jivas are the least, No-Bhava-siddh-No-Abhava-siddh Jivas are infinitely more than them, and Bhava-siddh Jivas are infinitely more than No-Bhava-siddh-No-Abhava-siddh Jivas. 242. Alternatively, all Jivas are of three types: Bhava-siddh, Abhava-siddh, and No-Bhava-siddh-No-Abhava-siddh. Bhava-siddh Jivas are Anadi-Saparyavasit (beginningless and ending), Abhava-siddh Jivas are Anadi-Aparyavasit (beginningless and unending), and No-Bhava-siddh-No-Abhava-siddh Jivas are Sadi-Aparyavasit (beginning and unending). Therefore, there is no difference between the three. In terms of quantity, Abhava-siddh Jivas are the least, No-Bhava-siddh-No-Abhava-siddh Jivas are infinitely more than them, and Bhava-siddh Jivas are infinitely more than No-Bhava-siddh-No-Abhava-siddh Jivas. This classification of all Jivas is based on the concept of Bhavya (capable of attaining liberation) and Abhavya (incapable of attaining liberation). Those who are capable of attaining liberation are Bhavya, those who are incapable of attaining liberation are Abhavya, and those who are free from the attributes of Bhavya and Abhavya are Siddha Jivas, who are neither Bhavya nor Abhavya. Bhava-siddh Jivas are Anadi-Saparyavasit (beginningless and ending), otherwise they would not be Bhava-siddh. Abhava-siddh Jivas are Anadi-Aparyavasit (beginningless and unending), otherwise they would not be Abhava-siddh. No-Bhava-siddh-No-Abhava-siddh Jivas are Sadi-Aparyavasit (beginning and unending) because Siddhas do not have any decline. Therefore, since they do not have a duration, there is no question of their state of existence, and there is no difference between these three. Because once a Jiva becomes Bhava-siddh, it is impossible for it to become Bhava-siddh again. Similarly, there is no difference in Abhava-siddh Jivas because they are Aparyavasit (unending) and never cease to exist. Siddhas are also Sadi-Aparyavasit (beginning and unending) and therefore there is no difference in them. In terms of quantity, Abhavya Jivas are the least because they are equivalent to the Jghana Yuka-Anantaka (the lowest category of Jivas). No-Bhava-siddh-No-Abhava-siddh Jivas are infinitely more than them because Siddhas are infinitely more than Abhavya Jivas. Bhava-siddh Jivas are infinitely more than No-Bhava-siddh-No-Abhava-siddh Jivas because Bhavya Jivas are infinitely more than Siddhas. 243. Alternatively, all Jivas are of three types: Trasa, Thavara, and No-Trasa-No-Thavara. Bhagavan! How long does a Trasa Jiva remain as Trasa? Gautama! The minimum duration is Antarmukhurta (a very short period of time), and the maximum duration is two Sagaro-Vamasahasra (two thousand Sagaro-Vamas). The duration of Thavara Jivas is Vanasai-Kala (a very long period of time). No-Trasa-No-Thavara Jivas are Sadi-Aparyavasit (beginning and unending). There is a difference in the duration of Vanasai-Kala for Thavara Jivas. There is a difference of two Sagaro-Vamasahasra (two thousand Sagaro-Vamas) for Thavara Jivas. There is no difference in No-Trasa-No-Thavara Jivas. In terms of quantity, Trasa Jivas are the least, No-Trasa-No-Thavara Jivas are infinitely more than them, and Thavara Jivas are infinitely more than No-Trasa-No-Thavara Jivas. This is the classification of all Jivas into three types. 243. Alternatively, all Jivas are of three types: Trasa, Thavara, and No-Trasa-No-Thavara. Bhagavan!

All beings can exist from [**Sarvajivaabhigam**] [155 and the best Saadhikas can exist up to two thousand Sagaropama. Stationary beings, as stationary beings, can exist until the end of the plant period. Notrasa-Nostaavara are Saadi-Aaparyavasita. The difference between them is the plant period, and the difference between stationary beings is two thousand Sagaropama. There is no difference between Notrasa-Nostaavara. In terms of Alpabahutva, the fewest are the S, from them Notrasa-Nostaavara (Siddha) are infinite times more, and from them stationary beings are infinite times more. This is the complete diversity of all beings. (This is not in the Sutra Vritti. After the Bhavasiddhikaadi Sutra, it ends by saying "Se Tam Tiviha Savvajiva Pannatta").  

**Four Types of All Beings** 244. Those who say that all beings are of four types, according to their statement, those four types are: Manoyogi, Vachanayogi, Kayayogi, and Ayogi.  

**How Long Do They Exist?**  
O Bhagavan! How long does a Manoyogi exist as a Manoyogi?  
Gautama! A Manoyogi exists from the least amount of time, one moment, to the most, Antarmuhurta.  
The same is true for a Vachanayogi.  
A Kayayogi exists from the least amount of time, Antarmuhurta, to the most, the plant period.  
An Ayogi is Saadi-Aaparyavasita.  
The difference between a Manoyogi is from the least amount of time, Antarmuhurta, to the most, the plant period.  
The same is true for a Vachanayogi.  
The difference between a Kayayogi is from the least amount of time, one moment, to the most, Antarmuhurta.  
There is no difference for an Ayogi.  

**How Many Are There?**  
In terms of Alpabahutva, the fewest are Manoyogis, from them Vachanayogis are countless times more, from them Ayogis are infinite times more, and from them Kayayogis are infinite times more.  

**Explanation**  
In terms of Vivechana-Yoga-Ayoga, here the four types of all beings are mentioned: Manoyogi, Vachanayogi, Kayayogi, and Ayogi. The Sanchittana, Antar, and Alpabahutva of these four are mentioned in this Sutra.  

**Sanchittana**  
A Manoyogi can exist as a Manoyogi from the least amount of time, one moment. After that, in the second moment, due to death or cessation of contemplation, one moment is mentioned. As...

[186] The *jiva-jiva-abhigamsutra* is first spoken about the speaker. It should be understood in relation to the specific *mano-yogya* *pudgala* reception. From excellence to *antar-muhurta*, one can remain *mano-yogi*. Due to the nature of the *jiva*, after this, he becomes *uparata* by rule. By *vacana-yogi*, here, only *vaga-yogi* with two senses, etc., are meant. They can remain from the lowest to one time and from excellence to *antar-muhurta*. This should also be understood in relation to the specific *vag-dravya* reception. By *kaya-yogi*, here, only *vaga-yogi* and *mano-yogi* with one sense, etc., are meant. They remain in the same way from the lowest to *antar-muhurta*. From two senses, etc., they can go to earth, etc., and remain for *antar-muhurta* and then return to two senses. From excellence, one can remain in that form until the *vanaspati-kala*. *A-yogi* are perfected. They are *sadi-aparyavasita*, therefore, they always remain in the same form. The difference between *mano-yogi* is the lowest *antar-muhurta*. After this, it is possible to receive specific *mano-yogya* *pudgalas*. From excellence, it is *vanaspati-kala*. After remaining in the *vanaspati* for that long, it is possible to return to the *mano-yogi*. Similarly, one should know the lowest and highest difference of *vaga-yogi*. The lowest difference of *kaya-yogi* is said to be one time and the highest difference is *antar-muhurta*. This statement is said in relation to *audarik-kaya-yoga*. Because in the *apantarala-gati* of two times, there is a difference of one time. From excellence, the difference is said to be *antar-muhurta*. This statement is in relation to the completion of the *paripurna-audarik-sharira-paryapti*. There, taking the time of *vigraha*, there is a difference of *antar-muhurta* until the completion of *audarik-sharira-paryapti*. Therefore, from excellence, the difference is said to be *antar-muhurta*. The *vrittikara* has quoted the statement of the *churnikara* in support of this statement. The *vrittikara* has also said that these *sutras* are difficult to understand because they are spoken with a different meaning, therefore, they should be understood from the *samyak-sampradaya*. That *samyak-sampradaya* is in this form, therefore, it is reasonable. One should not create the appearance of inconsistency without understanding the meaning of the *sutras*. One should only strive to make the *sutras* consistent. *Alpa-bahutva-dvara* are the fewest *mano-yogi*, because *deva*, *naraka*, *garbha-ja* *tiryak* *panchendriya* and *manushya* are the only *mano-yogi*. From them, *vacana-yogi* are countless times more, because *dvi-indriya*, *tri-indriya*, *chatur-indriya*, *asangya* *panchendriya* are *vaga-yogi*. From them, *a-yogi* are infinite times more, because *siddha* are infinite. From them, *kaya-yogi* are infinite times more, because *vanaspati* *jiva* are infinite times more than *siddha*. 245. *Ahva chaumviha savvajiva pannta, tam jaha–ithiveyaga purisaveyaga napunsakveyaga abeyaga.

## 18.]  A being with an age of a *purvakoti* (a very long time) may be born as a human or a female animal for five or six existences. Then, it may be born as an *aparigeehita* (unmarried) goddess in the *Ishaan* heaven with an age of fifty *palyopama* (a unit of time). From there, it may be born again as a human or a female animal with an age of *purvakoti* and then be born again as an *aparigeehita* goddess in the *Ishaan* heaven with an age of fifty *palyopama*. In this way, the being can remain in the female form for a total of 110 *palyopama* beyond the *purvakoti* duration.

From another perspective, the *kayasthiti* (state of existence) of a female being with an age of one hundred *palyopama* beyond the *purvakoti* duration occurs as follows: A female being with an age of *purvakoti* may be born as a human or a female animal for five or six existences. Then, it may be born as an *aparigeehita* goddess in the *Soudharma* heaven with an age of fifty *palyopama* and an excellent state. From there, it may be born again as a human or a female animal and then be born again as an *aparigeehita* goddess in the *Soudharma* heaven with an age of fifty *palyopama*. In this way, the *kayasthiti* of a female being with an age of one hundred *palyopama* beyond the *purvakoti* duration occurs.

From a third perspective, a female being with specific qualities may be born as a *parigeehita* (married) goddess in the *Ishaan* heaven with an excellent state and remain there for nine *palyopama*. Then, it may be born as a human or a female animal and then be born again as a *parigeehita* goddess in the *Ishaan* heaven with an excellent state for nine *palyopama*. In this way, the *kayasthiti* of a female being with an age of eighteen *palyopama* beyond the *purvakoti* duration occurs.

From a fourth perspective, a female being with the aforementioned qualities may be born as a *parigeehita* goddess in the *Soudharma* heaven with an excellent state for seven *palyopama*. Then, it may be born as a human or a female animal and then be born again as a *parigeehita* goddess in the *Soudharma* heaven with an excellent state for seven *palyopama*. In this way, the *kayasthiti* of a female being with an age of fourteen *palyopama* beyond the *purvakoti* duration occurs.

From a fifth perspective, the *kayasthiti* of a female being with an age of one *palyopama* beyond the *purvakoti* duration occurs as follows: A being with an age of *purvakoti* may be born as a human or a female animal for seven existences. Then, it may be born as a female being in the *Devakuru* heaven with an age of three *palyopama* and then be born as a goddess in the *Soudharma* heaven with a low state. In this way, the *kayasthiti* of a being with an age of one *palyopama* beyond the *purvakoti* duration occurs.

The *kayasthiti* of a male being is from the lowest *antarmuhoorta* (a very short time) to the highest *saadhik sagaropama shata* (a very long time). The lowest *kayasthiti* occurs when a being leaves the *striveed* (female) or *napusaka* (neuter) state and enters the *purusha* (male) state for a *antarmuhoorta* and then returns to the *striveed* state. The highest *kayasthiti* occurs when a being travels through the heavens, humans, and animals for a *saadhik sagaropama shata*. After this long period, the *purusha* state transforms.

Here, a doubt may arise: Just as the lowest *kayasthiti* of the *striveed* and *napusaka* states is said to be for a single time (referring to the experience of the *striveed* or *napusaka* state for a single time after the *vedopashmana* (cessation of karma) in the *upashma* category), why is the *purusha* state not said to have a lowest *kayasthiti* for a single time?

The solution is that a being who dies in the *upashma* category is born in the *purusha* state.

## All beings are classified into four categories:

**1.  Chakkhuvansaani (Those with eyes):**

* **Lowest:**  An interval of an antarmuhurta (a very short time).
* **Highest:**  A distance of a thousand oceans.

**2.  Achakkhuvansaani (Those without eyes):**

* **Two types:**
    * **Anaiyae (Without knowledge):**  Lowest is an interval of an antarmuhurta. Highest is a distance of a thousand oceans.
    * **Apjjavasaie (With knowledge):**  Lowest is an interval of an antarmuhurta. Highest is a distance of a thousand oceans.

**3.  Avidhi-dassaani (Those with knowledge of the path):**

* **Lowest:**  An interval of one time period.
* **Highest:**  A distance of two oceans.

**4.  Keval-dassaani (Those with perfect knowledge):**

* **Lowest:**  An interval of one time period.
* **Highest:**  A distance of two oceans.

190. The Jiva-Jiva-Migam Sutra states that the Kevala-darshani is Sadi-A-paryavasit. The difference between the Chakshu-darshani is from Anto-muhurt to Vanaspati-kala. There is no difference between the two types of A-chakshu-darshani. The difference between the Avadhi-darshani is from Anto-muhurt to Vanaspati-kala. There is no difference between the Kevala-darshani. The Avadhi-darshani are the least in number, the Chakshu-darshani are countless times more, the Kevala-darshani are infinite times more, and the A-chakshu-darshani are also infinite times more. 246. Alternatively, all Jivas are of four types: Chakshu-darshani, A-chakshu-darshani, Avadhi-darshani, and Kevala-darshani. Bhagavan! How long can a Chakshu-darshani remain a Chakshu-darshani? Gautama! From the lowest Anto-muhurt to the highest, it can remain for a thousand Sagaropama. There are two types of A-chakshu-darshani: Anadi-A-paryavasit and Anadi-Sa-paryavasit. The Avadhi-darshani can remain for a minimum of one time and a maximum of 66 Sagaropama. The Kevala-darshani is Sadi-A-paryavasit. The difference between the Chakshu-darshani is from Anto-muhurt to Vanaspati-kala. There is no difference between the two types of A-chakshu-darshani. The difference between the Avadhi-darshani is from Anto-muhurt to Vanaspati-kala. There is no difference between the Kevala-darshani. The Avadhi-darshani are the least in number, the Chakshu-darshani are countless times more, the Kevala-darshani are infinite times more, and the A-chakshu-darshani are also infinite times more. This Sutra explains the four types of Jivas, their Kayasthiti, difference, and relative number. Kayasthiti: The Chakshu-darshani can remain in the Chakshu-darshani form for a minimum of Anto-muhurt. It can leave the A-chakshu-darshani state and enter the Chakshu-darshani state for a period of Anto-muhurt and then return to the A-chakshu-darshani state. It can remain in the Chakshu-darshani state for a maximum of a thousand Sagaropama. There are two types of A-chakshu-darshani: Anadi-A-paryavasit, who will never attain Siddhi, and Anadi-Sa-paryavasit, the Bhavy Jivas who will attain Siddhi. The Anadi and A-paryavasit have no time limit. The Avadhi-darshani remains in that form for a minimum of one time. After attaining Avadhi-darshan, one may die within that time or lose Avadhi due to Mithyatva or bad intentions. It can remain in the Avadhi-darshani state for a maximum of 66 Sagaropama. The logic is as follows:

[A being with knowledge of disintegration] [191 If a being with knowledge of disintegration is born in the seventh earth below humans/ he remains there for thirty-three sagaropama/ when the time of upward movement is near, he attains samyaktva and leaves it again and is born in a tiryanch with the same age as before, with knowledge of disintegration/ from there he is again born in the seventh earth below, with disintegration, and remains there for thirty-three sagaropama/ during the time of upward movement, he attains samyaktva for a short time and leaves it again and is born in a tiryanch with the same age as before, with disintegration. In this way, being born twice in the seventh earth and twice in a tiryanch, there are 66 sagaropama in total/ since disintegration is prohibited in vigraha, it should be said that he is born in the form of avigraha.'] The statement that samyaktva occurs for a short time in between is because the knowledge of disintegration can only flourish for thirty-three sagaropama, the previous age, and beyond. Therefore, it is said that samyaktva occurs for a short time in between. In this way, after staying for 66 sagaropama, the being with knowledge of disintegration attains humanhood in the state of apatit vibhang, and by practicing restraint with samyaktva, he is born twice in the vijayadi vimanas, then he remains an avadhidarshi for another 66 sagaropama/ avadhidarshan is equal to avadhigyan and vibhanggyan. From this perspective, an avadhidarshi can remain in that form for two sixty-six sagaropama. A kevaladarshi is sadi-aparyavasit, so there is no time limit. The difference between antaradwar-chakshudarshi and antarmuhurt is negligible. After such a time, there can be a disruption of acchkshudarshan and then it can become chakshudarshi again/ the difference in excellence is vanaspatikala/ there is no difference in anadi-aparyavasit acchkshudarshan/ there is also no difference in anadi-saparyavasit. Once acchkshudarshanitva is gone, it does not happen again; for those whose karmas have been destroyed, there is no repetition. The negligible difference for an avadhidarshi is one time. After repetition, its benefit can be obtained only after a long time. In some places, the reading is antarmuhurt/ after such a disruption, it can be obtained again/ that reading is not baseless, because the original commentator has also mentioned it as a different opinion/ the difference in excellence for an avadhidarshi is vanaspatikala. After such a disruption, avadhidarshan definitely happens again/ there is no contradiction in anadi mithyadristi also happening/ knowledge happens only with samyaktva, but darshan does not necessarily happen with samyaktva. Since a kevaladarshi is sadi-aparyavasit, there is no difference. Alpabahutvadwar-avadhidarshi are the fewest, because it happens only to gods, narakas, and some garbhaja tiryanch panchendriya and humans. Chakshudarshi are countless times more than them, because it happens to all tiryanch panchendriya and chaturindriya. Kevaladarshi are infinite times more than them, because siddhas are infinite/ acchkshudarshi are infinite times more than them, because even ekendriya have acchkshudarshan. 1. Vibhangnani panchendriya tirikhhajonia manuya ya paharagaa, no anaharagaa. 2. "Vibhangnani jahannean ekkan samayan, ukkosenan teettisan sagarovamai desunaae punchakodie abbahiain tti".

[All living beings] [193 will take restraint and will attain perfection from the same attained restraint. The unrestrained one who is sadi-saparyavasit is the one who is corrupted by sarvavirati or deshavirati. There is no time limit for the sadi-saparyavasit unrestrained one because of being anadi and praparyavasit. The sadi-saparyavasit unrestrained one remains from the lowest to the antarmuhurta / after this, one can again become restrained / from the highest to the infinite time, which is the infinite utsarpini-avsarpinī form (from kalamargana) and the deshon aparthapudgalparavarta form from kshetramargana. The kayasthiti of the restrained-unrestrained one is from the lowest to the antarmuhurta. The attainment of restrained-unrestrainedness happens from many bhangas, yet it is from the lowest to the antarmuhurta! From the highest to the deshon purvakoti / because of its absence in childhood, one should know deshonata. The unrestrained-unrestrained-unrestrained-restrained ones are siddhas. They are sadi-aparyavasit. They always remain in that form. The difference of the antardwar restrained one is from the lowest to the antarmuhurta. From the unrestrainedness of this much time, one can again come into restrainedness / from the highest to the infinite time, which is the deshon pudgalparavarta form from the kshetra / the one who has attained restraint before, after the interruption of this much time, gains restraint by rule / the anadi-aparyavasit unrestrained one has no difference / the anadi-saparyavasit unrestrained one also has no difference. The difference of the sadi-saparyavasit unrestrained one is from the lowest to one time and from the highest to the deshon purvakoti. The interruption form of unrestrainedness, the restrained time and the restrained-unrestrained time, is the same from the highest / the difference of the restrained-unrestrained one is from the lowest to the antarmuhurta. Because from that, one can again become restrained-unrestrained in this much time / from the highest, one should say like the restrained one / the unrestrained-unrestrained-unrestrained-restrained ones are siddhas. Because they are sadi-aparyavasit, there is no difference / because they are aparyavasit, they always remain in that form.    The alpabahutvadwar - the fewest restrained ones, because they are countless koti-koti in number. The restrained-unrestrained ones are countless times more than them, because countless ones are deshavirati tiryanch. The siddhas who are tri-taya-pratisedha form are countless times more than them, and the unrestrained ones are countless times more than them, because the plants are countless times more than the siddhas. All living beings - five types - statement 248. Those who said this way, the five types of all living beings, they said this way, as follows - kohakasai, manakasai, mayakasai, lobhakasai, akasai.   Kohakasai, manakasai, mayakasai, from the lowest to the antarmuhurta, from the highest to the antarmuhurta / lobhakasai, from the lowest to one time, from the highest to the antarmuhurta / akasai, two types, as follows.

## Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra 248:

Those who say there are five types of all beings, according to them, these five distinctions are as follows: Krodhakṣayī, Mānakṣayī, Māyakṣayī, Lobhakṣayī, and Akṣayī.

Krodhakṣayī, Mānakṣayī, and Māyakṣayī remain in that form from the lowest to the Antarmuhūrta and from the highest to the Antarmuhūrta. Lobhakṣayī can remain in that form from the lowest to one time and from the highest to the Antarmuhūrta.

Akṣayī are of two types (as said before): Sādi-Aparyavasin and Sādi-Sapyavasit. Sādi-Sapyavasit can remain in that form from the lowest to one time and from the highest to the Antarmuhūrta.

The difference between Krodhakṣayī, Mānakṣayī, and Māyakṣayī is from the lowest to one time and from the highest to the Antarmuhūrta. The difference between Lobhakṣayī is from the lowest to the Antarmuhūrta and from the highest to the Antarmuhūrta. Regarding Akṣayī, understand as said before.

In terms of Alpabahutva, Akṣayī are the fewest, Mānakṣayī are infinitely more than them, and Krodhakṣayī, Māyakṣayī, and Lobhakṣayī should be known as progressively more numerous.

From the perspective of Vivecana-Kṣaya-Akṣaya, the five types of all beings are as follows: Krodhakṣayī, Mānakṣayī, Māyakṣayī, Lobhakṣayī, and Akṣayī. Their Kayasthiti, Antar, and Alpabahutva are as follows:

**Kayasthiti:** The Kayasthiti of Krodhakṣayī, Mānakṣayī, and Māyakṣayī is from the lowest to the Antarmuhūrta and from the highest to the Antarmuhūrta. Because it is said that the usage time of Krodha etc. is Antarmuhūrta. Lobhakṣayī remains in that form from the lowest to one time. This statement is based on the expectation that death occurs after the first time of the rise of Lobhakṣaya when falling from the Upaśamaśreṇī. It is possible for someone to experience Krodha etc. at the time of death. Falling in order happens in the state of Mṛtyābhāva, not in death. The Kayasthiti from the highest is Antarmuhūrta.

**Akṣayī** are of two types: Sādi-Aparyavasin (Kevali) and Sādi-Sapyavasit (Upaśāntakṣayī). The Kayasthiti of Sādi-Sapyavasit Akṣayī is from the lowest to one time. Death in the second time can lead to the attainment of Sakṣayattva due to the rise of Krodha etc. From the highest, it is Antarmuhūrta, because the time of Upaśāntamohguṇasthāna is the same.

Other Ācāryas say that it should be called Antarmuhūrta even from the lowest, because it is an old tradition that death does not occur before the Antarmuhūrta for Lobhopaśama. This statement seems to be in line with the intention of the Sūtrakāra, because he later mentions the Kayasthiti of Lobhakṣayī as from the lowest and from the highest to the Antarmuhūrta.

**Antar:** The Antar of Krodhakṣayī is from the lowest to one time, because death after the Upaśamasamaya can lead to its rise again. From the highest, it is Antarmuhūrta. Similarly, the Antar of Mānakṣayī and Māyakṣayī should be said. The Antar of Lobhakṣayī is from the lowest to the Antarmuhūrta and from the highest to the Antarmuhūrta, only the difference between the lowest and the highest is greater.

1.  **Krodhāyupayogakālo Antarmuhūrta mitivacanāt** (Because it is said that the usage time of Krodha is Antarmuhūrta).

##  Translation:

**All Beings** [195  The difference between a Sadi-Aparisamvasit Akashayi and a Sadi-Parisamvasit Akashayi is not there / The difference between a Sadi-Parisamvasit Akashayi and a Sadi-Aparisamvasit Akashayi is from a moment to a moment. After this much time, there can be a gain in rank. From the highest, it is an infinite time, which is from the field to the country, half-pudgala-paravarta. In this much time, the attainment of the previously experienced Akashayitva is obtained by rule. Alpabahutva-dwar - the fewest Akashayi, because only Siddhas are Akashayi. From them, the Manakashayi are infinite times more, because the Nigoda-Jivas are infinite times more than the Siddhas. From them, the Krodhakashayi are more special, because the rise of Krodhakashaya is long-lasting, from them the Mayakashayi are more special, and from them the Lobhakashayi are more special, because the rise of Maya and Lobha is very long-lasting. 249. Or all beings are of five types - Nairyaik, Tiryaikyonik, Manushya, Deva and Siddha / The Sanchittana and Antar should be said as before. In Alpabahutva, the fewest are Manushya, from them the Nairyaik are countless times more, from them the Deva are countless times more, from them the Siddha are infinite times more, and from them the Tiryaikyonik are infinite times more / This is the five-fold classification of all beings. 249.

How long can an Avadhi-Jnani remain continuously in that form? Gautama! He can remain continuously from the least, one time, to the most, the Sadhik Chhiya-Sath Sagaropama. Bhagavan! How long can a Manah-Paryaya-Jnani remain continuously in that form? Gautama! He can remain continuously from the least, one time, to the most, the Deshon Purva-Koti. Bhagavan! How long does a Kevala-Jnani remain continuously in that form? Gautama! The Kevala-Jnani is Sadi-A-Paryavasit. The Ajnani are of three types: 1. Anadi-A-Paryavasit, 2. Anadi-Sa-Paryavasit, and 3. Sadi-Sa-Paryavasit. Of these, the Sadi-Sa-Paryavasit is from the least, the Antarmuhurta, to the most, the Ananta-Kala, which is the Deshon A-Pardha-Pudgala-Paravarta form. The difference of the Abhinibodhik-Jnani is from the least, the Antarmuhurta, to the most, the Ananta-Kala, which is the Deshon A-Pardha-Pudgala-Paravarta form. Similarly, the difference of the Shruta-Jnani, Avadhi-Jnani, and Manah-Paryaya-Jnani should be said. The Kevala-Jnani has no difference. The difference of the Sadi-Sa-Paryavasit Ajnani is from the least, the Antarmuhurta, to the most, the Sadhik Chhiya-Sath Sagaropama._**

**[All Beings Access]** [197] In the context of "least to most", the six categories of all beings are described as follows, considering the least to most number of senses, starting with the five-sensed beings, then the four-sensed, then the three-sensed, then the two-sensed, then the infinite-virtue beings without senses, and finally the infinite-knowledge beings with one sense. These categories are: 1. **Aabhinibodhik Jnanee** (Mati Jnanee), 2. **Shruta Jnanee**, 3. **Avadhi Jnanee**, 4. **Manah Paryaya Jnanee**, 5. **Keval Jnanee**, 6. **Ajnanee**.

The duration, interval, and "least to most" aspects of these categories are described in this sutra. 

**Duration (Kayasthiti):**

* **Aabhinibodhik Jnanee:** The duration of this state can be from the least, which is an **Antarmuhurt** (a very short period of time), to the maximum, which is **Saadhik Chhiyaasath Sagaropama** (a period of time equivalent to 64 oceans). This should be understood as a period of time that is twice the duration of the **Vijay** (a specific period of time).
* **Shruta Jnanee:** The duration of this state is the same as the **Aabhinibodhik Jnanee**, because both **Aabhinibodhik Jnan** and **Shruta Jnan** are inseparable. It is said that where **Aabhinibodhik Jnan** exists, **Shruta Jnan** also exists, and vice versa. These two are mutually dependent.
* **Avadhi Jnanee:** The duration of this state is from the least, which is **Ek Samaya** (one moment), to the maximum, which is **Saadhik Chhiyaasath Sagaropama**, similar to the **Mati Jnanee**. This **Ek Samaya** should be understood as the time between the attainment of **Avadhi Jnan** and death or the time between the attainment of **Avadhi Jnan** and falling into **Mithyatva** (falsehood) due to **Pratipat** (a specific type of mental state).
* **Manah Paryaya Jnanee:** The duration of this state is from the least, which is **Ek Samaya**, because death can occur in the second moment, leading to **Pratipat**. The maximum duration is **Deshon Purvakoti** (a specific period of time), because the duration of **Charitrakal** (a specific period of time) is the same as the maximum duration.
* **Keval Jnanee:** The duration of this state is **Sadi-Aperyavasit** (infinite and without beginning). Therefore, this state never ends.
* **Ajnanee:** There are three types of **Ajnanee**: **Anadi-Aperyavasit** (without beginning and without end), **Anadi-Sapyavasit** (without beginning but with an end), and **Sadi-Sapyavasit** (with a beginning and with an end). The duration of the **Sadi-Sapyavasit Ajnanee** is from the least, which is **Antarmuhurt**, because after this period, they can attain **Samyaktva** (right knowledge) and become a **Jnanee** again. The maximum duration is **Anantkal** (infinite time), which is **Deshon Aparthpudgalparavart** (a specific period of time), because after losing **Jnanitva** (knowledge), they will definitely become a **Jnanee** again after this period of time.

**Interval (Antar):**

* **Aabhinibodhik Jnanee:** The least interval is **Antarmuhurt**. After this period, they can become an **Aabhinibodhik Jnanee** again. The maximum interval is **Deshon Aparthpudgalparavart**.
* **Shruta Jnanee, Avadhi Jnanee, Manah Paryaya Jnanee:** The interval for these categories should be understood in the same way as the **Aabhinibodhik Jnanee**.
* **Keval Jnanee:** There is no interval for this category because it is **Sadi-Aperyavasit**.
* **Anadi-Aperyavasit Ajnanee, Anadi-Sapyavasit Ajnanee:** There is no interval for these categories because they are **Aperyavasit** (without end) and **Anadi** (without beginning).
* **Sadi-Sapyavasit Ajnanee:** The least interval is **Antarmuhurt**, because after this period, they can become an **Ajnanee** again from a **Jnanee**. The maximum interval is **Saadhik Chhiyaasath Sagaropama**.

**Note:** 1. "Jatth Aabhinibodhiyanaan, Tatth Suyanaan, Jatth Suyanaan, Tatth Aabhinibodhiyanaan, Dovi Eyaai Annopan Manugayaai" - This quote explains the inseparable nature of **Aabhinibodhik Jnan** and **Shruta Jnan**.

## 198] [Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra _ Alp-Bahutva-Dwar]

The Manah-Paryaya-Jnani are the fewest, because Manah-Paryaya-Jnana is only attained by those with specific character. The Avadhi-Jnani are countless times more numerous, because even Devas and Narakas possess Avadhi-Jnana. The Abhinibodhik-Jnani and Shruta-Jnani are both privileged and equal in their own place. The Kevala-Jnani are infinitely more numerous, because the Siddha Kevala-Jnani are infinite. The Agnani are infinitely more numerous, because the Agnani Vanaspatikayik Jivas are infinitely more numerous than the Siddhas. 

Or, considering the Indriya and Anindriya, all Jivas are said to be of six types: Eka-Indriya, up to Pancha-Indriya, and Anindriya. The Anindriya are Siddhas. Their Kay-Sthiti, Antar, and Alp-Bahutva have been explained earlier. 

251. Or, all Jivas are classified into six types: Audarik-Shariri, Vaikriya-Shariri, Aharak-Shariri, Tejas-Shariri, Karman-Shariri, and Ashariri. 

Bhagavan! How long can an Audarik-Shariri remain? 

Gautam! From the lowest, two moments less than the Ksullak-Bhav-Grahan, and from the highest, for an Asankhyeya-Kal. This Asankhyeya-Kal is equal to the time taken to exhaust the space of an Asankhyeya-th part of an Angul. 

The Vaikriya-Shariri can remain from the lowest, an Antar-Muhurta, and from the highest, for thirty-three Sagaropama more than an Antar-Muhurta. 

The Aharak-Shariri can remain from the lowest, an Antar-Muhurta, and from the highest, only for an Antar-Muhurta. 

The Tejas-Shariri are of two types: Anadi-Aparyavasit and Anadi-Saparyavasit. 

Similarly, the Karman-Shariri are also of two types. 

The Ashariri are Sadi-Aparyavasit.

**[All Living Beings]**

**[199]** The difference in the duration of an **Audārika** body is a minimum of one **samaya** and a maximum of thirty-three **sāgaropamas** more than an **antarmuhūrta**. The difference in the duration of a **Vaikriya** body is a minimum of an **antarmuhūrta** and a maximum of an **anantakāla**, which is equivalent to the duration of a **vanaspatikāla**. The difference in the duration of an **Āhārak** body is a minimum of an **antarmuhūrta** and a maximum of an **anantakāla**, which is the form of **deśona** **apārddha** **pudgala** **parāvṛtta**. There is no difference in the duration of a **Tejas-Kārmaṇa** body.

**_In terms of quantity, the Āhārak** body is the least, the Vaikriya body is countless times more than that, the Audārika body is countless times more than that, the **Aśarīrī** is countless times more than that, the **Tejas-Kārmaṇa** body is countless times more than that, and they are both equal in their own place. Thus, the understanding of the six types of all living beings is complete.

**_The discussion of the body and the non-body reveals that all living beings are of six types: Audārika, Vaikriya, Āhārak, Tejas, Kārmaṇa, and Aśarīrī. Their state of existence, difference, and quantity are as follows:_**

**_State of Existence:_** The **Audārika** body can exist in its form continuously from the minimum of two **samayas** less than the **kṣullakbhava** to the maximum of an **asanख्येयकाल**. In the **vigraha** state, it is said to be two **samayas** less because it is a **Kārmaṇa** body in the first two **samayas**. It can exist for an **asanख्येयकाल**. Production is possible without **vigraha** for this duration. This **asanख्येयकाल** is equal to the time it takes to remove countless parts of an **angula** from countless **ākāśa** regions, one at a time, until they are completely devoid of matter. The **Vaikriya** body exists in its form from a minimum of one **samaya**. Death is possible only after an **anantakāla** of **vikūrvaṇā**. It exists from a maximum of an **antarmuhūrta** to thirty-three **sāgaropamas** more. **_One should understand this in relation to a virtuous **saṃyati** who, by taking on a **Vaikriya** body, lives for an **antarmuhūrta** and is born in the **anuttaravimānas** through **avigraha** due to the destruction of the state of existence._** The **Āhārak** body can exist in its form from a minimum of an **antarmuhūrta** to a maximum of an **antarmuhūrta**. The **Tejas** and **Kārmaṇa** bodies are of two types: **anādi-aparyavasita** (never liberated) and **anādi-saparyavasita** (liberated). Both of these are **anādi** and **aparyavasita**, so they are without a time limit. The **Aśarīrī** is **sādi-aparyavasita**. Therefore, it always remains in its form.

**_Difference:_** The difference in the **Audārika** body is one **samaya** from the minimum. It exists in a **vigraha** state of two **samayas**, because it is a **Kārmaṇa** body in the first **samaya**. The difference from the maximum is an **antarmuhūrta** plus thirty-three **sāgaropamas**. This is the maximum **Vaikriya** time. The difference in the **Vaikriya** body is a minimum of an **antarmuhūrta**. After becoming **Vaikriya** once, it can become **Vaikriya** again after this much interruption. This happens in humans and gods. The difference from the maximum is clearly a **vanaspatikāla**. The minimum difference in the **Āhārak** body is an **antarmuhūrta**. After becoming **Āhārak** once, it can become **Āhārak** again after this much interruption. The difference from the maximum is an **anantakāla**, which is the form of **deśona** **apārddha** **pudgala** **parāvṛtta**. There is no difference in the **Tejas-Kārmaṇa** body.

[200] [Jivaji Dabhigam Sutra] _ The Alpabahutva (few in number) are the Aharaksharir (those who have a body that consumes food), because they are at most two thousand to nine thousand. The Vaikriyasarir (those who have a body that is not made of matter) are countless times more than them, because Devas (gods), Narakas (hells), Garbhaja (embryos), Tiryanch (animals), Panchendriya (five senses), Manushya (humans), and Vayukaya (air body) are all Vaikriyasarir. The Audarikasharir (those who have a body that is made of matter and is not limited to a single form) are countless times more than them. / In Nigodas (groups of souls), there are countless souls in a single Audarikasharir, so it is countless times more, not infinitely more. / As the original commentator said, "The Asharir (those who have no body) are infinitely more than the Audarikasharir, because the Siddhas (liberated souls) are infinite, and the Audarikasharir are countless times more than the body." The Asharir are infinitely more than the Audarikasharir, because the Siddhas are infinite. The Tejas-Karmanasharir (those who have a body that is made of Tejas (light) and Karma (action)) are infinitely more than them, because in Nigodas, the Tejas-Karmanasharir is different for each soul, and they are infinite. / Tejas and Karmanasharir are inseparable and equal to each other. Thus, the understanding of the six types of Sarvajiva (all beings) is complete. Sarvajiva - Seven Types - Statement 252.

All beings are classified into seven types: Krishna-leshya, Nila-leshya, Kapota-leshya, Tejo-leshya, Padma-leshya, Shukla-leshya, and Aleshya.

**भगवन् ! कृष्णलेश्या वाला, कृष्णलेश्या वाले के रूप में काल से कितने समय तक रह सकता है ?**
**गौतम ! जघन्य से अन्तर्मुहूर्त और उत्कर्ष से अन्तर्मुहूर्त अधिक तेतीस सागरोपम तक रह सकता है।**

**Translation:**

**Lord! How long can a Krishna-leshya being remain in the Krishna-leshya state?**
**Gautam! It can remain for a period ranging from a minimum of Antarmuhurta to a maximum of thirty-three Sagaropama, exceeding the Antarmuhurta by the amount of Antarmuhurta.**

**Lord! How long can a Nila-leshya being remain in that state?**
**Gautam! It can remain for a period ranging from a minimum of Antarmuhurta to a maximum of ten Sagaropama, exceeding the Antarmuhurta by an immeasurable portion of Palyopama.**

**A Kapota-leshya being remains for a period ranging from a minimum of Antarmuhurta to a maximum of three Sagaropama, exceeding the Antarmuhurta by an immeasurable portion of Palyopama. A Tejo-leshya being can remain for a period ranging from a minimum of Antarmuhurta to a maximum of three Sagaropama, exceeding the Antarmuhurta by an immeasurable portion of Palyopama. A Padma-leshya being remains for a period ranging from a minimum of Antarmuhurta to a maximum of ten Sagaropama, exceeding the Antarmuhurta by an immeasurable portion of Palyopama. A Shukla-leshya being can remain for a period ranging from a minimum of Antarmuhurta to a maximum of thirty-three Sagaropama, exceeding the Antarmuhurta by the amount of Antarmuhurta. Aleshya beings are Sadi-Apayavasi, therefore they always remain in the same state.**

**Lord! What is the difference between Krishna-leshya beings?**
**Gautam! The difference between Krishna-leshya beings is from a minimum of Antarmuhurta to a maximum of thirty-three Sagaropama, exceeding the Antarmuhurta by the amount of Antarmuhurta. Similarly, you should know the difference between Nila-leshya and Kapota-leshya beings. The difference between Tejo-leshya beings is from a minimum of Antarmuhurta to a maximum of the duration of a plant's life, exceeding the Antarmuhurta by the amount of Antarmuhurta. Similarly, the difference between Padma-leshya and Shukla-leshya beings is the same. Lord! What is the difference between Aleshya beings?**
**Gautam! Since Aleshya beings are Sadi-Apayavasi, there is no difference between them.**

**Lord! Among these Krishna-leshya, Nila-leshya, and so on, up to Shukla-leshya and Aleshya beings, who is inferior, superior, equal, or special?**

**Gautam! Shukla-leshya beings are Samvatho, Padma-leshya beings are Sankhyejjana, Tejo-leshya beings are Sankhyejguna, Aleshya beings are Pranantaguna, Kapota-leshya beings are Anantaguna, Nila-leshya beings are Vishesahiya, and Krishna-leshya beings are Vishesahiya. Thus, all beings are classified into these seven types.**

## Jīvālivābhigamasūtra - Gautama!

**The Seven Types of Souls:**

* **Śuklaleśyā:** The least numerous, followed by...
* **Padmaleśyā:** Numerically greater than Śuklaleśyā.
* **Tejoleśyā:** Numerically greater than Padmaleśyā.
* **Bhaleśyā:** Infinitely numerous.
* **Kāpotaleśyā:** Infinitely numerous, greater than Bhaleśyā.
* **Nīlaleśyā:** Infinitely numerous, greater than Kāpotaleśyā.
* **Nīlaleśyā Viśeṣādhika:** Greater than Nīlaleśyā.
* **Kṛṣṇaleśyā Viśeṣādhika:** Greater than Nīlaleśyā Viśeṣādhika.

This sūtra describes seven types of souls, six with leśyā and one without (aleśyā).

**Explanation of their Kāyasthiti (Body-State), Antar (Interval), and Alpबहुत्व (Numerical Abundance):**

**Kāyasthiti:**

* **Kṛṣṇaleśyā:** The lowest kāyasthiti is an antarmuhūrta (a period of 48 minutes). This is because in the case of humans and animals, Kṛṣṇaleśyā lasts for an antarmuhūrta. The highest kāyasthiti is 33 sāgaropamas (a period of 100,000 years). This is because the highest kāyasthiti of Kṛṣṇaleśyā is found in the devās (gods) and nārkas (hell beings) who are in the state of paścātyabhava (past life) and agretnabhava (future life). The nārkas of the Adhasaptamapṛthvī (the seventh earth from the top) are Kṛṣṇaleśyā and have a kāyasthiti of 33 sāgaropamas. Their paścātyabhava is an antarmuhūrta and their agretnabhava is one antarmuhūrta, making a total of two antarmuhūrtas. However, due to the countless divisions within an antarmuhūrta, they are all included within a single antarmuhūrta. Therefore, the highest kāyasthiti of Kṛṣṇaleśyā is 33 sāgaropamas.
* **Nīlaleśyā:** The lowest kāyasthiti is one antarmuhūrta. The reasoning is the same as for Kṛṣṇaleśyā. The highest kāyasthiti is 10 sāgaropamas, which is an innumerable part of a palyopamas (a period of 100,000 years). This is because the nārkas of the first stone of the Dhūmaprabhāpṛthvī (the earth of smoke and light) are Nīlaleśyā and have this kāyasthiti. Their paścātyabhava and agretnabhava are included within the innumerable parts of a palyopamas, so they are not mentioned separately.
* **Kāpotaleśyā:** The lowest kāyasthiti is one antarmuhūrta. The reasoning is the same as for Kṛṣṇaleśyā. The highest kāyasthiti is 3 sāgaropamas, which is an innumerable part of a palyopamas. This is because the nārkas of the first stone of the Bālukaprabhā (the earth of sand and light) are Kāpotaleśyā and have this kāyasthiti.
* **Tejoleśyā:** The lowest kāyasthiti is one antarmuhūrta. The reasoning is the same as for Kṛṣṇaleśyā. The highest kāyasthiti is 2 sāgaropamas, which is an innumerable part of a palyopamas. This is because the Iśānadevas (gods of the north) are Tejoleśyā.
* **Padmaleśyā:** The lowest kāyasthiti is one antarmuhūrta. The reasoning is the same as for Kṛṣṇaleśyā. The highest kāyasthiti is 10 sāgaropamas. This is because the Brahmalokadevas (gods of the Brahma world) are Padmaleśyā.
* **Śuklaleśyā:** The lowest kāyasthiti is one antarmuhūrta. The reasoning is the same as for Kṛṣṇaleśyā. The highest kāyasthiti is 33 sāgaropamas. This is because the Anuttaradevas (gods of the highest world) are Śuklaleśyā.

**Antar:**

* **Kṛṣṇaleśyā:** The lowest antar is one antarmuhūrta, because the leśyā of humans and animals changes within an antarmuhūrta. The highest antar is 33 sāgaropamas, because the highest duration of Śuklaleśyā is the highest duration of the antar of Kṛṣṇaleśyā.
* **Nīlaleśyā and Kāpotaleśyā:** The lowest and highest antar should be understood in the same way as for Kṛṣṇaleśyā.
* **Tejoleśyā, Padmaleśyā, and Śuklaleśyā:** The lowest antar is one antarmuhūrta and the highest antar is a vanaspatikāla (a period of 100 years).
* **Aleśyā:** There is no antar for Aleśyā because they are without leśyā.

## Sajiwaabhigam [203]

**Alpabahutyadwar** - Those with the least amount of **Shuklaleshya** are few in number, because **Lantk** etc. gods, a sufficient number of **garbhja** (born from womb) **panchendriya** (five-sensed) **tiryanch** (animals) and humans have **Shuklaleshya**. 

**Padmaleshya** are countless times more than those with **Shuklaleshya**, because **Sanatkumar**, **Mahendra** and **Brahmalok** gods, and a vast number of **garbhja** **tiryanch** and humans have **Padmaleshya**. 

**Doubt:** If **Sanatkumar** etc. gods of the three kalpas are countless times more than **Lantk** etc. gods, then those with **Padmaleshya** should be countless times more than those with **Shuklaleshya**. Why are they said to be countless times more?

**Solution:** Even in the **Javanayapad** (world of birth), there are countless times more **panchendriya** **tiryanch** with **Shuklaleshya** than **Sanatkumar** etc. gods of the three kalpas. Therefore, those with **Padmaleshya** are only countless times more than those with **Shuklaleshya**.

**Tejoleshya** are countless times more than those with **Padmaleshya**, because there are countless times more **tiryanch** with five senses, humans, **bhavanpati** (lords of the house) **vyantar jyotishk** (celestial bodies) and gods of **Soudharma** and **Ishana** devlokas (heavenly realms) who have **Tejoleshya**.

**Aleshya** are infinite times more than those with **Tejoleshya**, because **Siddhas** (liberated souls) are infinite.

**Kapoteleshya** are infinite times more than those with **Aleshya**, because there are infinite times more **vanaspatikayik** (plant-bodied beings) with **Kapoteleshya** than **Siddhas**.

**Neelaleshya** are many times more than those with **Kapoteleshya**.

**Krishnaaleshya** are many times more than those with **Neelaleshya**, because there are many with **klishta** (difficult) **adhayavasaya** (determination).

This completes the seven types of **sarvajiva** (all beings) **pratipatti** (attainment).

**Sarvajiva** - **Ashtavidha** (eight types) - **Vaktvyata** (description) 254.

## 204] [The Sutra on the Approach of Souls (Jiva-Jiva-Abhigamsutra) states that there are two types of souls, with countless differences, infinite qualities, and infinite differences in their duration. / 254. Those who say that there are eight types of all beings mean that all beings are of eight types, differentiated by their knowledge: Abhinibodhik-Jnani, Shruta-Jnani, Avadhi-Jnani, Manah-Paryaya-Jnani, Kevala-Jnani, Mati-Ajnani, Shruta-Ajnani, and Vibhang-Jnani.  O Bhagavan! For how long does an Abhinibodhik-Jnani remain as an Abhinibodhik-Jnani? Gautam! From the least, an Antarmuhurta, to the most, sixty-four Sagaropama. A Shruta-Jnani also remains for the same duration. An Avadhi-Jnani remains from the least, one time, to the most, sixty-four Sagaropama. / A Manah-Paryaya-Jnani remains from the least, one time, to the most, Deshona Purva-Koti. A Kevala-Jnani, being Sadi-A-Paryavasit, remains forever in that form. Mati-Ajnanis are of three types: 1. Anadi-A-Paryavasit, 2. Anadi-Sa-Paryavasit, and 3. Sadi-Sa-Paryavasit. / Of these, the Sadi-Sa-Paryavasit remains from the least, Antarmuhurta, to the most, infinite time, which is Deshona A-Pardha-Pudgala-Paravarta form. / A Shruta-Ajnani also remains for the same duration. A Vibhang-Jnani remains from the least, one time, to the most, Deshona Purva-Koti plus thirty-three Sagaropama. / The difference in an Abhinibodhik-Jnani is from the least, Antarmuhurta, to the most, infinite time, which is Deshona Pudgala-Paravarta form. Similarly, one should know the difference in a Shruta-Jnani, Avadhi-Jnani, and Manah-Paryaya-Jnani. There is no difference in a Kevala-Jnani, because he is Sadi-A-Paryavasit. Among Mati-Ajnanis, there is no difference in those who are Anadi-A-Paryavasit. There is no difference in those who are Anadi-Sa-Paryavasit. There is a difference in those who are Sadi-Sa-Paryavasit, from the least, Antarmuhurta, to the most, sixty-four Sagaropama. Similarly, one should know the difference in a Shruta-Ajnani. / The difference in a Vibhang-Jnani is from the least, Antarmuhurta, to the most, Vanaspatikala. O Bhagavan! Among these Abhinibodhik-Jnani, Shruta-Jnani, Avadhi-Jnani, Manah-Paryaya-Jnani, Kevala-Jnani, Mati-Ajnani, Shruta-Ajnani, and Vibhang-Jnani, who is less, more, equal, or superior to whom? Gautam! The least are Manah-Paryaya-Jnani. Avadhi-Jnani are countless times more than them. Mati-Jnani and Shruta-Jnani are superior and equal in their own place. Vibhang-Jnani are countless times more than them. Kevala-Jnani are infinite times more than them. Mati-Ajnani and Shruta-Ajnani are infinite times more than them and equal in their own place. / Discussion - This has been discussed in the sixth chapter of the treatise on all beings. Therefore, the inquisitive can see it there. 255. Or, if you wish to know the duration of the different types of beings, then know this: There are Nirjaria, Tiryak-Joni, Manushya, Deva, and Siddha. O Bhagavan! For how long does a Nirjaria remain? Gautam! From the least, a thousand years of dwelling, to the most, thirty-three Sagaropama. O Bhagavan! For how long does a Tiryak-Joni remain? From the least, Antarmuhurta, to the most, Vanaspatikala.

Discussion: The discussion of this should be seen in the sixth **Pratipatti** called **Saptavidha Pratipatti** of the **Samsarasamaapannaka Jiva**. This **Ashtavidha Sarvajiva Pratipatti** is complete.

**Sarvajivabhigam [209]**

**Bhavan!** How long does a Siddha remain in the Siddha form?

**Gautam!** A Siddha is **sadi-aparyavasit** (eternal). He remains in that form forever.

**Bhavan!** What is the difference between a **Prathamasamaynairyik** and an **Aprathama-samaynairyik**?

**Gautam!** The difference between a **Prathamasamaynairyik** and an **Aprathama-samaynairyik** is:

* **Jghanya** (minimum): 10,000 years more than an **antarmuhurt** (a very short period of time) for a **Prathamasamaynairyik** and an **antarmuhurt** for an **Aprathama-samaynairyik**.
* **Utkarhsa** (maximum): **Vanaspatikala** (the lifespan of a plant) for both.

**Bhavan!** What is the difference between a **Prathamasamayatiryagyonik** and an **Aprathama-samayatiryagyonik**?

**Gautam!** The difference between a **Prathamasamayatiryagyonik** and an **Aprathama-samayatiryagyonik** is:

* **Jghanya** (minimum): Two **kshullkabhavgrahan** (very short periods of time) less than a **samaya** (a very long period of time) for a **Prathamasamayatiryagyonik** and a **kshullkabhavgrahan** more than a **samaya** for an **Aprathama-samayatiryagyonik**.
* **Utkarhsa** (maximum): **Vanaspatikala** (the lifespan of a plant) for a **Prathamasamayatiryagyonik** and **saadhik sagaropama shataprithaktva** (a very long period of time) for an **Aprathama-samayatiryagyonik**.

**Bhavan!** What is the difference between a **Prathamasamayamanushya** and an **Aprathama-samayamanushya**?

**Gautam!** The difference between a **Prathamasamayamanushya** and an **Aprathama-samayamanushya** is:

* **Prathamasamayamanushya** is the same as a **Prathamasamayatiryagyonik**.
* **Aprathama-samayamanushya** is a **kshullkabhavgrahan** more than a **samaya** and **Vanaspatikala** (the lifespan of a plant) for **Utkarhsa**.

**Bhavan!** What is the difference between a **Prathamasamaydeva** and an **Aprathama-samaydeva**?

**Gautam!** The difference between a **Prathamasamaydeva** and an **Aprathama-samaydeva** is:

* **Prathamasamaydeva** is the same as a **Prathamasamaynairyik**.
* **Aprathama-samaydeva** is the same as an **Aprathama-samaynairyik**.

Since a Siddha is **sadi-aparyavasit** (eternal), there is no difference.

**Bhavan!** Among these **Prathamasamaynairyik**, **Prathamasamayatiryagyonik**, **Prathamasamayamanushya**, and **Prathamasamaydeva**, who is the least, who is the most, who is equal, and who is superior?

**Gautam!**

* **Prathamasamayamanushya** are the least.
* **Prathamasamaynairyik** are **asankhyaguna** (infinitely more) than **Prathamasamayamanushya**.
* **Prathamasamaydeva** are **asankhyatguna** (infinitely more) than **Prathamasamaynairyik**.
* **Prathamasamayatiryagyonik** are **asankhyatguna** (infinitely more) than **Prathamasamaydeva**.

**Bhavan!** Among these **Aprathama-samaynairyik**, **Aprathama-samayatiryagyonik**, **Aprathama-samayamanushya**, and **Aprathama-samaydeva**, who is the least, who is the most, who is equal, and who is superior?

**Gautam!**

* **Aprathama-samayamanushya** are the least.
* **Aprathama-samaynairyik** are **asankhyeyaguna** (infinitely more) than **Aprathama-samayamanushya**.
* **Aprathama-samaydeva** are **asankhyeyaguna** (infinitely more) than **Aprathama-samaynairyik**.
* **Aprathama-samayatiryagyonik** are **anantaguna** (infinitely more) than **Aprathama-samaydeva**.

**Bhavan!** Among these **Prathamasamaynairyik** and **Aprathama-samaynairyik**, who is the least and who is the most?

**Gautam!**

* **Prathamasamaynairyik** are the least.
* **Aprathama-samaynairyik** are **asankhyatguna** (infinitely more) than **Prathamasamaynairyik**.

**Bhavan!** Among these **Prathamasamayatiryagyonik** and **Aprathama-samayatiryagyonik**, who is the least and who is the most?

**Gautam!**

* **Prathamasamayatiryagyonik** are the least.
* **Aprathama-samayatiryagyonik** are **anantaguna** (infinitely more) than **Prathamasamayatiryagyonik**.

The **alpbahutva** (difference in number) of **manushya** (humans) and **deva** (gods) should be described like **nairyik** (those who are not bound by karma).

**Bhavan!** Among these **Prathamasamaynairyik**, **Prathamasamayatiryagyonik**, **Prathamasamayamanushya**, **Prathamasamaydeva**, **Aprathama-samaynairyik**, **Aprathama-samayatiryagyonik**, **Aprathama-samayamanushya**, **Aprathama-samaydeva**, and **Siddha**, who is the least and who is the most?

[All-beings-approach] [211 Bhagavan! How long do Earth-bodied beings live as Earth-bodied beings? Gautama! From the least, an antarmukhurta, and from the most, an innumerable time, which is from the innumerable Utsarpini-Avasarpini forms (Kalmarganga) and from the Kshetramarganga, it is equal to the time of the innumerable Lokakashapradeshas. Similarly, one should know the duration of the Apkayika, Tejaskaika, and Vayukaika. Bhagavan! What is the duration of the Vanaspatikaika? Gautama! From the least, an antarmukhurta, and from the most, the Vanaspatikaal. Bhagavan! How long can a two-sensed being live as a two-sensed being? Gautama! From the least, an antarmukhurta, and from the most, a Sankhyata time. Similarly, one should know the duration of the three-sensed and four-sensed beings. Bhagavan! How long does a five-sensed being live as a five-sensed being? Gautama! From the least, an antarmukhurta, and from the most, a Sadik one thousand Sagaropama. Bhagavan! How long does an insensed being live as an insensed being? Gautama! Since it is Sadi-Aperyavasit, it always remains in that form. Bhagavan! What is the difference of the Earth-bodied beings? Gautama! From the least, an antarmukhurta, and from the most, the Vanaspatikaal. Similarly, one should know the difference of the Apkayika, Tejaskaika, and Vayukaika. The difference of the Vanaspatikaika is the same as the duration of the Earth-bodied beings, that is, from the least, an antarmukhurta, and from the most, an innumerable time. Similarly, the difference of these four, the two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, and five-sensed, is from the least, an antarmukhurta, and from the most, the Vanaspatikaal. Since the insensed is Sadi-Aperyavasit, it has no difference. Bhagavan! Among these Earth-bodied, Apkayika, Tejaskaika, Vayukaika, Vanaspatikaika, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, five-sensed, and insensed, who is less, more, equal, or superior to whom? Gautama! The five-sensed are the least, the four-sensed are superior to them, the three-sensed are superior to them, the two-sensed are superior to them, the Tejaskaika are innumerable times more, the Earth-bodied are superior to them, the Apkayika are superior to them, the Vayukaika are superior to them, the insensed are infinite times more, and the Vanaspatikaika are infinite times more. The discussion of the logic and feeling of all these has been said in the previous places. Therefore, it is not being repeated. The inquisitive people should see it in its place. 259.

##  Anadhyayakala [Quoted from Nandī Sūtra edited by Ācārya Pravartarī Śrī Prātmārāmji Mahārāja]

One should study the scriptures only during the time prescribed for study in the Pāgamas. Studying during Anadhyayakala is prohibited. The Manusmṛti and other Smṛtis also describe Anadhyayakala in detail. Vedic people also mention the Anadhyayas of the Vedas. Similarly, other Ārya scriptures are also considered Anadhyaya. Since the Jain Āgamas are also considered to be Sarvajñokta, Devādhiṣṭhita, and Svaravidyā, their Anadhyayakala is also described in the Āgamas. For example, the ten types of Anadhyayas related to the sky are: 

1. Ukkāvāte (meteor shower)
2. Disidādhē (fire in the sky)
3. Gajjite (thunder)
4. Nigghāte (lightning)
5. Juvate (wind)
6. Jakkhālitte (earthquake)
7. Dhūmita (smoke)
8. Mahita (fog)
9. Rayugghaate (rain)
10.  The end of the day.

The ten types of Anadhyayas related to the body are:

1. Aṭṭhī (bones)
2. Maṁsaṁ (flesh)
3. Soṇitte (blood)
4. Asūtisāmante (death)
5. Susāṇasāmante (cremation)
6. Candovārāte (moonlight)
7. Sūrovārāte (sunlight)
8. Paḍanē (falling)
9. Rāyavugghē (illness)
10. The end of the body.

- **Stāhnāṅga Sūtra, Stāna 10**

A Niggantha or a Nigganthī should not study during the four Mahāpāḍivayas:

1. Āsāḍhapāḍivaya
2. Indamahāpāḍivaya
3. Kattipāḍivaya
4. Sugimhapāḍivaya

- **Stāhnāṅga Sūtra, Stāna 4, Uddesa 2**

A Niggantha or a Nigganthī should not study during the four Saṁjhās:

1. Paḍimāte (morning)
2. Pacchimāte (afternoon)
3. Majjhaṇhē (noon)
4. Aḍḍharatte (midnight)

- **Stāhnāṅga Sūtra, Stāna 4, Uddesa 2**

A Niggantha or a Nigganthī can study during the four Kālas:

1. Puvvaṇhē (early morning)
2. Avaraṇhē (evening)
3. Papprosē (sunrise)
4. Pacchūsē (sunset)

- **Stāhnāṅga Sūtra, Stāna 4, Uddesa 2**

According to the above Sūtrapāṭha, there are thirty-two Anadhyayas: ten related to the sky, ten related to the body, four Mahāpāḍivayas, four Mahāpāḍivaya Pūrṇimās, and four Saṁjhās. These are briefly described below:

**Ten Anadhyayas related to the sky:**

1. **Ukkāpāta-Tārāpatan:** If there is a major starfall, one should not study for one Prahara.
2. **Digdāha:** One should not study as long as the direction is red, meaning it appears as if there is fire in the direction. 

Page #729:
---------------------------
[Chapter on Unfavorable Time for Study] 3-4. Thunder and lightning are generally caused by the nature of the season. Therefore, the period from Ardra to Swati Nakshatra is not considered unfavorable for study. 5. If there is a loud thunderclap in the sky without clouds, or if there is thunderclap with clouds, then there is an unfavorable time for study for two Praharas. 6. In the Shukla Paksha of the month of Yupa, the combination of the evening glow and the moonlight on the first, second, and third days is called Yupa. During these days, one should not study from Prahara to night. 7. Yakshadeepta - Sometimes, a light appears in a direction, like lightning, but with a slight delay. This is called Yakshadeepta. Therefore, one should not study as long as the Yaksha-like light is visible in the sky. 8. Dhumika Krishna - The period from Kartik to Magh is the gestation period of clouds. During this time, a fine, water-like mist of smoky color falls. This is called Dhumika Krishna. One should not study as long as this mist falls. 9. Mihika Shweta - In winter, a fine, water-like mist of white color is called Mihika. One should not study as long as this falls. 10. Raj Udghāt - Due to wind, dust spreads all over the sky. One should not study as long as this dust remains spread. The above ten reasons are related to the sky and are unfavorable for study. Ten unfavorable reasons related to the material world are as follows: 11-12-13. Bones, flesh, and blood - If the bones, flesh, and blood of a five-sensed animal are visible, then there is an unfavorable time for study until these things are removed from there. The commentator considers the presence of these things within 60 hands to be unfavorable. Similarly, the presence of bones, flesh, and blood of a human being is also considered unfavorable. The difference is that the unfavorable time for these is up to 100 hands and for one day and night. The unfavorable time for a woman's menstrual period is three days. The unfavorable time for the birth of a boy and a girl is considered to be seven and eight days respectively. 14. Impurity - There is an unfavorable time for study until the excrement and urine are visible. 15. Cremation ground - The area around the cremation ground up to 100 hands on all sides is considered unfavorable for study. 16. Lunar eclipse - During a lunar eclipse, one should not study for eight Praharas for the lowest category, twelve Praharas for the middle category, and sixteen Praharas for the highest category. 17. Solar eclipse - During a solar eclipse, the unfavorable time for study is considered to be eight, twelve, and sixteen Praharas respectively.

## Chapter 18: 

**18. Anadhyayakala:**  When a great king or a national leader passes away, one should not perform *svadhyaya* until their cremation is completed. Alternatively, one should gradually resume *svadhyaya* only after a new authority takes over.

**19. Rajavyudgraha:** When neighboring kings are engaged in war, one should not perform *svadhyaya* for a day and night even after peace is restored.

**20. Audarik Sharira:** When a five-sense being dies within the confines of an *upaashraya*, one should not perform *svadhyaya* as long as the body remains there. Similarly, if the lifeless body lies within a radius of 100 hands, *svadhyaya* should be avoided. These ten reasons for avoiding *svadhyaya* are related to the *audarik sharira*.

**21-28. Four Mahotsav and Four Mahapratipada:** The four *mahotsav* are Ashadh Purnima, Paush Purnima, Kartik Purnima, and Chaitra Purnima. The *pratipada* following these *purnimas* are called *mahapratipada*. *Svadhyaya* is prohibited during these days.

**29-32. Pratah, Sayam, Madhyahna, and Ardharatri:** One should not perform *svadhyaya* one *ghadi* before and one *ghadi* after sunrise, one *ghadi* before and one *ghadi* after sunset, one *ghadi* before and one *ghadi* after midday, and one *ghadi* before and one *ghadi* after midnight.
