From the beginning of time, every being in the world is bound by the strong chains of karma. Why, how, by whom, how much, and what kind of relationship does this karma have with the conscious soul? No one has ever been able to fully understand and break free from these bonds. The compassionate Acharya Nemichandra, in order to provide simple understanding of these questions, extracted the Karmakanda text from the षखण्डागम. To overcome the complexities of Prakrit and Sanskrit, the great Pandit Todarmalji translated this text into the Dhundhari language. To further clarify the subject, the learned Aryika 105 Shri Adimati Mataji wrote a commentary on it, which was edited by the expert in Karananuyoga, the late Pandit Ratanchandji Mukhtar of Saharanpur.
The wise scholar Pandit Pannalalji Sahityacharya, from the Jain world, has done commendable work by presenting the essence of this text to society through 300 questions and answers, making it easy to understand the above questions. It is my hope that the benevolent beings who seek self-benefit will make good use of this unique work and make sincere efforts to break free from karma.

## Introduction

This is the third book in the series of concise yet authentic books on the subject of 'Karananuyoga' in the question-answer format, authored by Pandit Pannalalji Sahityacharya. Like the first two books, this one is also published by the Shri Bharatvarshiya Digambar Jain (Dharma Rakshini) Mahasabha as 'Karananuyoga Deepak - Third Part'.

The first part of Karananuyoga Deepak was written based on Gommatasar Jeevakand. The second part was based on Gommatasar Karmakand. Both have 166 and 300 question-answers respectively. This third part contains 258 question-answers related to Lok-Rachana (creation of the universe), written based on Triloksar, Tiloypannatti Rajavartika and Swami Kartikeyanupreksha (Lokanupreksha). It has five chapters - the first chapter describes Adholok (lower world), the second chapter describes Bhavanantrik (intermediate world), the third chapter describes Vaimanik Dev (aerial gods), the fourth chapter describes Tiryaak-Lok (animal world), and the fifth chapter provides specific definitions related to Karan (cause). All the question-answers are fully capable of providing sufficient knowledge of the subject in simple language for the common reader.

Page #4:
---------------------------
The utility of these books in the question-answer style is undeniable. In teaching camps, these books serve as textbooks from which both teachers and students benefit greatly in a limited time. I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the venerable Panditji for these useful publications.

Pandit Pannalalji Sahityacharya is a renowned scholar of the Jain world. His life is dedicated to the service of the scriptures. For the past five or six decades, he has been engaged in the study, teaching, translation, and writing of Jain texts. Every self-learner is familiar with his numerous translated and original works. The knowledgeable and elderly ascetic Panditji still keeps himself busy with continuous study, teaching, and writing. He does not let even a moment go to waste. Expressing my reverence for the honorable Panditji, I wish him a healthy, disease-free, and long life.

Reverend Aryika 105 Shri Vishuddhamati Mataji and Pandit Jawaharlalji Siddhanta Shastri, Bhindar, have carefully reviewed the questions and answers written by Panditji and enriched them with the necessary information to clarify the subject. Reverend Aryika Prashantamarti Mataji has carefully reviewed the entire press copy...

---------------------------
It has been rewritten and prepared, making it convenient for printing. I am deeply grateful to all those who have contributed to this publication. The Publication Department of the Mahasabha deserves our congratulations for this useful publication.
It is hoped that the self-beneficiary readers will recite this booklet and make a sincere effort to purify their knowledge - Thus auspicious.

---------------------------
The first and second parts of the "Karananuyog Deepak" have already reached the hands of the readers. This is its third part. It contains a compilation of some useful topics based on the Lokanupreksha under the categories of Triloksar, Tiloypranali, Rajavartika, and Swamikartikeyanupreksha. Samantabhadra Swami has described the characteristics of Karananuyog as follows:

"Lokalok - vibhakte - ryugparivrtteshchaturgtinaancha | Adarshamiv tathamatirvaiti karananuyogamcha ||"

Meaning, a Samyaggyani Jiva knows Karananuyog, which clearly describes the division of Lok and Alok, the change of Yugas, and the four Gatis, like a mirror.

Earlier, Triloksar Shastri was the textbook for the first part, so its study was arranged in schools. But due to the complexity of the subject, it is no longer a textbook. Therefore, students are deprived of knowledge about Lok. Chapters 3 and 4 of Rajavartika are also not included in the curriculum. Only self-studying men and women acquire knowledge about these subjects through self-study.

Shri 105 Vishuddhamati Mataji has written detailed Hindi commentaries on Triloksar, Siddha Tassar Deepak, and Tiloypannatti, making it easier for self-studying...

Page #7:
---------------------------
The great souls have done a great favor. With the aim of awakening the interest of today's student community in this direction, I had compiled some essential topics from these texts in the style of question-and-answer. I had sent their press copy to Pt. Jawaharlalji Shastri, Bhindar, a specialist in **Karananuyoga**, and **Aryika Shri 105 Vishuddhamati Mataji**. Mataji has done a commendable job of expanding and clarifying the compiled question-and-answer. Pt. Jawaharlalji has clarified the question-and-answer by giving comments in some places. In this way, this third part of **Karananuyoga Deepak** is going into the hands of the readers after being supervised.
Our friend Dr. Shri Chetanprakashji Patni, Jodhpur, has taken great pains in its flawless and elegant publication. Like the first and second parts, this part is also being published by the publication department of the **Bharatvarshiya Digambar Jain (Dharma Rakshakini) Mahasabha**.
I express my gratitude and respect to all the above-mentioned great souls who have contributed to the propagation of **Jinvani**.

## Karanaanuyoag Deepak
### Third Path
#### First Right
##### Mangalacharan
||  Having bowed to the Mother of the World, || ||  A description of the Lok is being made as per the scriptures. ||
1. Question: What is Lok? Answer: The infinite space where the six substances - Jiva, Pudgala, Dharma, Adharma, Akash and Kal - are present in a field-like state, is called Lok. 
2. Question: What is the shape of Lok? Answer: The shape of Lok is like that of a man standing with both legs spread out and both hands on his waist.

Page #11:
---------------------------
The shape is like that of a staff (vetrasan) in the lower world (adholouk), a fringe (jhalar) in the middle world (madhyalouk), and a soft substance (mrid) in the upper world (urdhalouk). 3. Question: What is the extent, height, and volume of the lokas? Answer: The extent of the lokas is seven rajus wide in all directions, north to south. The extent in the east-west directions is seven rajus at the bottom, decreasing upwards to one raju in the middle world, then increasing upwards to five rajus near the Brahma loka, and then decreasing upwards to one raju at the end. The height of the lokas is fourteen rajus from the lower world to the top. The total volume of the lokas is the cube of seven rajus, i.e., 7 x 7 x 7 = 343 (three hundred forty-three) cubic rajus. 4. Question: What is the area and volume of the lower world (adholouk)? Answer: The area is obtained by adding the mouth and the base, dividing by two, and multiplying by the height, which is seven rajus. The volume is obtained by multiplying the area by the thickness. The mouth of the lower world is one raju, the base is seven rajus, adding both and dividing by two gives four rajus.

Page #12:
---------------------------
By halving, there are 4 *Raju*. Multiplying these 4 *Raju* by the *pad* (height) of 7 *Raju*, we get 4 x 7 = 28 square *Raju*, which is the area of the *Adhol* (lower realm). Multiplying this area by the north-south extent of 7 *Raju*, we get 28 x 7 = 196 cubic *Raju*, which is the volume of the *Adhol*.

**Question 5:** What is the area and volume of the *Urdhvalok* (upper realm)?

**Answer:** The face of the *Ardh-Urdhvalok* (half upper realm) is 5 *Raju* and the ground is 5 *Raju*. Adding these and halving, we get 3 *Raju*. Multiplying these 3 *Raju* by the *pad* (height) of 3 *Raju*, we get 3 x 3 = 9 square *Raju*, which is the area of the *Ardh-Urdhvalok*. Multiplying this area by the north-south extent of 7 *Raju*, we get 9 x 7 = 63 cubic *Raju*, which is the volume of the *Ardh-Urdhvalok*.

Doubling the area and volume, we get 9 x 2 = 18 square *Raju* and 63 x 2 = 126 cubic *Raju*, which are respectively the area and volume of the entire *Urdhvalok*.

**Question 6:** How is the *Lok* (universe) structured?

**Answer:** The *Lok* is divided into three parts: *Adhol*, *Madhyalok* (middle realm), and *Urdhvalok*. The *Adhol* is 7 *Raju* in extent below the *Meru* mountain. The *Meru*...

Page #13:
---------------------------
From the base of the mountain to 6 *Raju* there are seven earths: Ratnaprabha, Sharkaraprabha, Balukaprabha, Pra, Dhumraprabha, Tamah Prabha and Maha Tamah Prabha. Below this, there is a space of 1 *Raju* which is devoid of earth (earthless) and is filled with the five stationary beings (Nigoda etc.).

The height of Mount Meru is the measure of the middle world (Madhyaloka). Mount Meru is one thousand yojanas deep inside the earth (root depth), ninety-nine thousand yojanas outside, i.e., on the earth, and has a peak of forty yojanas.

The height of the upper world (Urdhvaloka) is 7 *Raju* less than the height of the middle world. From the peak of Mount Meru, leaving a distance of 1 *Bal* (hair's breadth), up to the end of the world (Lokanta), i.e., 7 *Raju*, is the Urdhvaloka. In the Urdhvaloka, there are 16 heavens, 6 Graiveyak, 6 Anudish, 5 Anuttar and the Siddhaloka.

**Construction**

1. "Below the seventh earth, in one *Raju*, there is only Nigoda." This is a misconception among readers. In reality, the five stationary beings are present there as well. It is also said: "Therefore, below that part, there is a space of one *Raju* which is devoid of earth and is filled with the five stationary beings (Nigoda etc.)." (Karthi Anu. / Lokanupreksha Ga. 120 commentary in Shatkhandagam, in Kshetranugam, it is clearly written that the five stationary beings are present everywhere in the world. (Dhaval 4/8788 etc.)

Page #14:
---------------------------
7 Question: What is the foundation of the Lok (universe)?
Answer: **Vānavāya**, **Nidā**, and **Anuśatana**, these three **Vātavalaya** are the foundation of the Lok. Just as bark surrounds a tree on all sides, so too do these three **Vātavalaya** surround the Lok on all sides.
Similar to three layers, first is the **Ghanodadhi Vātavalaya** with the color of cow urine. After that is the **Ghan Vātavalaya** with the color of mung beans, and after that is the **Tanu Vātavalaya** with many colors. In the lower part of the **Lokākāśa**, in both lateral parts, from below to a height of one **Rāju**, that is, up to the five **sthāvara**, below the seven **narakabhūmi** (earths) and the eighth earth called **Īṣatprāgbhāra**, all three **Vātavalaya** are twenty thousand yojanas thick each.
In both lateral parts, above one **Rāju**, near the seventh earth, in all eight directions, the three **Vātavalaya** are 7, 5, and 4 yojanas thick respectively. Then, decreasing in order, in the eight directions of the **Madhyaloka**, they are 5, 4, and 3 yojanas thick. Then, increasing in order, in the eight directions of the **Brahmaloka**, they are 7, 5, and 4 yojanas thick. Then, decreasing in order upwards, in the lateral part of the **Lokāna**, they are 5, 4, and 3 yojanas thick. These three **Vātavalaya** at the peak of the Lok...

Page #15:
---------------------------
In sequence, 2 kos, 1 kos and 1575 dhanush remain thick.
Question: Where and at what height are heaven and hell located in the world?
Answer: Below Mount Meru, between the Vajra and Vaidurya plates, in the form of a square institution, is the eighth region of the sky, the Lok.
From the center of the Lok, up to Aishghan heaven is 13 raju, up to Mahendra heaven is 3 raju, up to Brahmalok is 33 raju, up to Kapishtha heaven is 4 raju, up to Mahashukra heaven is 43 raju, up to Sahasrar heaven is 5 raju, up to Pranat heaven is 53 raju, up to Achyut heaven is 6 raju and up to Lokant is 7 raju high.
From the center of the Lok, down to Sharkara earth is 1 raju, below that again, the five earths are one raju each. In this way, up to the seventh earth is 6 raju and up to Lokant is 7 raju.
6. Question: What is the width of the Lok?
Answer: At the bottom, in the root of the Adholok, the width is 7 raju, in the Madhyalok, it is...

Page #16:
---------------------------
1 Raju in Brahmaloka, 5 Raju in the front of the loka and 1 Raju in the front of the loka.
From the middle of the loka, 1 Raju down, at the end of the Sharkara Prithvi, there is a width of 16 Raju. One Raju down from that, at the end of the Baluka Prabha, there is a width of 24 Raju. One Raju down from that, at the end of the Pad Prabha, there is a width of 3 Raju. Then, one Raju down, at the end of the Dhum Prabha, there is a width of 4 Raju. Again, one Raju down, at the end of the Tamah Prabha, there is a width of 53 Raju. Again, one Raju down, at the end of the Maha Tamah Prabha, there is a width of 6 Raju. Then, one Raju down, at the end of the Kal Kal Prithvi, there is a width of 7 Raju.
Similarly, from the middle of the loka, one Raju up, there is a width of 26 Raju. Then, one Raju up, there is a width of 36 Raju. Then, one Raju up, there is a width of 4 Raju. Then, half a Raju up, there is a width of 5 Raju. Again, half a Raju up, there is a width of 4 Raju. Then, one Raju up, there is a width of 33 Raju. Then, one Raju up, there is a width of 21 Raju. Then, one Raju up, at the end of the loka, there is a width of 1 Raju.
10. Question: Which types of beings reside where in the loka?
Answer: Prithvi Kayika, etc., five types of stationary beings are filled throughout the loka, but Tras beings reside only in the Tras Nali (except for special conditions like Samudghat, etc.). In the middle of the loka...

Page #17:
---------------------------
There is a **Tras Nali** which is one **Raju** long, one **Raju** wide and fourteen **Raju** high. In this **Tras Nali**, in an area of 32162241-2/3 **Dhanushkam** and 13 **Raju** measure, both mobile and immobile beings reside. **Naraki** reside in the middle of the seventh earth, below which no **Tras** beings reside. Below the seventh earth, in an area of one **Raju** measure, only immobile beings reside. In the **Urddhvalok**, **Tras** beings reside up to the **Sarvarthasiddhi Vimana**. In **Lokant**, in an area of 525 **Dhanush** above 15% of the **Manush** measure **Tanvatala**, **Siddh Paramesthis** reside. 

**Question 11:** How are 321622413 **Dhanush** obtained? 

**Answer:** The height of the **Tras Nali** is fourteen **Raju** measure. Below the seventh **Naraka**, there is a **Kalakal** immobile **Lok** of one **Raju** measure, where no **Tras** beings reside, hence it is called thirteen **Raju**. Even in this, **Naraki** (**Pras**) are only in the middle part of the seventh **Naraka**, not in the lower 3666 **Yojan** or 316646663 **Dhanush**. Similarly, in the **Urddhvalok**, there is a gap of 12 **Yojan** or 66,000 **Dhanush** between the eighth earth called **Eshthpraagbhar** and **Sarvarthasiddhi**. The thickness of the eighth earth is 6 **Yojan** or 64,000 **Dhanush**, and above it are two **Kos** (4,000 **Dhanush**), one **Kos** (2,000 **Dhanush**).

Page #18:
---------------------------
And there are three Vātavalayas with a thickness of 1575 Dhanus. There are no Trasa jivas in this entire region. Its total dimension (316646663 Dhanus + 66,000 Dhanus + 64,000 Dhanus + 4,000 Dhanus + 2,000 Dhanus + 15.75 Dhanus) = 321622413 Dhanus) is obtained. 

Question 12: In what state are Trasa jivas found outside the Trasa nāli? 

Answer: Trasa jivas are found outside the Trasa nāli in the state of Upapāda, Māranāntika Samudghāta, and Lokapūraṇa Samudghāta.

For example, a stationary being living outside the Trasa nāli is coming towards the Trasa nāli to be born as a Trasa jiva after dying. At that time, the Trasa jiva's presence outside the nāli is considered more favorable than Upapāda, as the karma of "Bas Nāma" arises only during the disintegration of that being.

A Trasa jiva living inside the Trasa nāli, due to the Ubhayād... Māranāntika-Pariṇada-Tasamujjhiāuṇ, is considered to be in a state of Sesatsa. This is confirmed by the Jinas.

(Jīvakāṇḍa Gāthā 65)

Page #19:
---------------------------
Before death, a stationary being undergoes a **Bharantik Samudghat** to be born outside. Before death, the **As-Nama Karma** of that being arises, and with the **Tras-Nama Karma**, it is found outside the **Tras-Nali**.

In the **Lopuran Samudghat**, when the **Atma-Pradesh** of the **Kevali Bhagwan** spreads throughout the universe, even then **Tras-Jivas** are found outside the **Tras-Nali** (due to the arising of the **Tras-Nama Karma** of the **Kevali Bhagwan**).

**Question 13:** What are the **Ruddha-Nama** of the **Ratanprabha** and other Earths located in the **Adholok**?

**Answer:** The **Ruddha-Nama** of the **Ratanprabha** and other Earths are, in order, **Dharma**, **Vansha**, **Megha**, **Anjana**, **Arishta**, **Madhava**, and **Madhavi**.

**Question 14:** How many parts are there in the **Ratanprabha** Earth, what is their **Bahalya** (thickness), and what are their length and width?

**Answer:** There are three parts to the **Ratanprabha** Earth: **Khar-Bhag**, **Pank-Bhag**, and **Apbahul-Bhag**. The **Bahalya** of these three is, respectively, sixteen thousand, eighty-four thousand, and eighty thousand **Yojanas**. The thickness of the first Earth is 1,80,000 **Yojanas**.

Page #20:
---------------------------
In the Khar Bhaga, there are sixteen earths, each one thousand yojanas thick: 1. Chitra, 2. Vajra, 3. Vaidurya, 4. Lohita, 5. Masar-Kalpa, 6. Gomeda, 7. Prabhala, 8. Jyotir-sa, 9. Anjana, 10. Anjanamoolika, 11. Anka, 12. Sphatika, 13. Chandana, 14. Sarvarthaka, 15. Bakula, 16. Shaila. There is no gap between these sixteen earths. The length and breadth of these sixteen earths extend to the end of the Lok, thus proving the Lokpraman. The Pank Bhaga and Apbahul Bhaga also have length and breadth that are Lokpraman.

15. Question: What is the thickness of the second and subsequent earths (Mogarai)? Answer: The thickness of the second earth, Sharkara, is 32,000 yojanas, Balukaprabha is 28,000 yojanas, Pankaprabha is 24,000 yojanas, Dhum-prabha is 20,000 yojanas, Tamah-prabha is 16,000 yojanas, and Mahatam-prabha is 8,000 yojanas. 

16. Question: What is the base of the seven earths? Answer: Below the seven earths, Ratnaprabha etc., there are three Batavalayas, each twenty thousand yojanas thick, and below them is the sky. One earth is not connected to another. The earths are situated with a gap of one Raju, which is less than the thickness of the earth.

Page #21:
---------------------------
17. Question: How many layers are there in the earths Ratnaprabha etc.? Answer: There are 13 layers in Ratnaprabha earth, 11 in Sharkaraprabha, 6 in Balukaprabha, 7 in Pankaprabha, 5 in Dhumaprabha, 3 in Tamahprabha and 1 in Mahatama Prabha. The total number of layers in all seven earths is 46. These layers are interconnected. 18. Question: How many burrows are there in the earths Ratnaprabha etc. and where are they located? Answer: There are thirty lakhs, twenty-five lakhs, fifteen lakhs, ten lakhs, three lakhs, five less than one lakh and only five burrows respectively in the earths Ratnaprabha etc. The first earth has a large number of burrows and in the other five earths, leaving a thickness of one thousand yojanas above and below, the burrows are located in the middle, in the layers that are formed. The seventh earth is eight thousand yojanas thick. In this, leaving a lot of thickness above and below, the burrows are located only in the middle. These burrows are called hell. 16. Question: How are the burrows arranged in the hell-layers?

Page #22:
---------------------------
Answer: The arrangement of the burrows in the hell-layers is in the form of Indraka, श्रेणिबद्ध (Shrenibadh) and प्रकीर्णक (Prakirnak).
The one that is exactly in the middle of all the burrows of its layer is called the Indraka burrow. The burrows that are located in a row in all four directions and in the विदिशा (Vidisha) of this Indraka burrow are called श्रेणिबद्ध (Shrenibadh) burrows. Those that are scattered in between the श्रेणिबद्ध (Shrenibadh) burrows like scattered flowers are called प्रकीर्णक (Prakirnak) burrows.
This structure exists in each layer. In the first thirteen layers of the earth (hell), there are 13 Indraka burrows. In the other hells, there are 11, 6, 7, 5, 3, 1 Indraka burrows respectively, according to the number of layers. The total number of Indraka burrows is 46.
In the first layer of the first hell, there are 46-46 श्रेणिबद्ध (Shrenibadh) burrows in each direction and 48-48 in the विदिशा (Vidisha). From the second Indraka burrow to the last Indraka burrow located in the seventh hell, the number of श्रेणिबद्ध (Shrenibadh) burrows decreases by one each time, so that in the last Indraka burrow, there is only one श्रेणिबद्ध (Shrenibadh) burrow in each of the four directions, but no श्रेणिबद्ध (Shrenibadh) burrows are found in the विदिशा (Vidisha).
Question 20: What is the extent and shape of the burrows?
Answer: The Indraka burrows are only one yojana in extent. (13)

Page #23:
---------------------------
The श्रेणिबद्ध bils are all of immeasurable yojana extent. Among the प्रकीर्णक bils, some are of measurable yojana extent and some are of immeasurable yojana extent. These bils are round, square, and triangular in shape. 

Question 21: How are the obstacles of heat, etc., in the hell bils?
Answer: The first hell is extremely hot from the earth up to three-fourths of the fifth hell, and the remaining one-fourth of the fifth hell, and the sixth and seventh hells are extremely cold. That is, there is extreme heat in a total of (30,00,000 + 25,00,000 + 15,00,000 + 10,00,000 + 22,50,000) 82,25,000 bils, and there is extreme cold in (75,000 + 66665 + 5) 1,75,000 bils.

Question 22: How is the arrangement of लेश्या in the hell beings of each earth?
Answer: In the hell beings of the first and second earths, there is कापोत लेश्या, in the hell beings of the upper bils of the third earth, there is कापोत लेश्या, and in the hell beings of the lower bils of the third earth, there is नील लेश्या, in the hell beings of the fourth earth, there is नील लेश्या, in the hell beings of the upper bils of the fifth earth, there is

Page #24:
---------------------------
In the Narakas (hells), the Narakis (hell beings) in the Neel Leshya (blackish hue) and the Narakis in the lower Bils (pits) have Krishna Leshya (darker hue). The Narakis of the sixth Prithvi (earth) have Krishna Leshya and the Narakis of the seventh Prithvi have Param Krishna Leshya (extremely dark hue). In the Narakas, the Dravya Leshya (material hue) and the Aayu-Praman (life span) remain the same, but the Bhav Leshya (emotional hue) remains constant, although there are changes in the Antmuhoota (final moments). This means that there are many Avantaar Bhed (subdivisions) like Kapoot (pigeon), Mand-Mandatar-Mandatam (slow, slower, slowest), etc.

Question: What is the system of Vikriya (reaction) in the Narakas?

Answer: The entire environment of the Narakas is filled with suffering. The pain experienced from the mere touch of the ground there is greater than the pain of being bitten by a thousand scorpions simultaneously. There is terrible suffering from hunger and thirst. As soon as a Naraki being is born in a Narak Bil (hell pit), it trembles in fear and falls among thirty-six weapons, jumping from there. Old Narakis threaten the new Narakis and run towards them. They inflict unbearable pain on each other. Screaming, many Naraki beings are pierced like sesame seeds in thousands of instruments. Many Naraki beings are tortured by other Narakis with chains, saws, axes, spears, etc. They are thrown into hot oil, cooked in burning flames. Trees...

Page #25:
---------------------------
Leaves, fruits, clusters, etc., fall upon the Narakas like vajradandas.
The Narakas who were addicted to other women have the image of a red-hot iron maiden firmly attached to their bodies and are thrown into burning fire.
The Narakas who were fond of eating meat in their previous lives have their flesh cut by other Narakas, who then put those pieces of flesh into their mouths.
Other Narakas pour molten iron, heated to an extreme degree, into the mouths of the Narakas who consumed padhu and ka, causing all their limbs to melt from the intense heat.
Wicked Narakas tear their bodies into pieces as small as sesame seeds, yet they rejoin like mercury.
The form, taste, smell, and touch of that place are all terrifying. The Asurakumaras of the Ambavarisha clan make the Narakas fight each other. They are satisfied by watching their battles. No one helps anyone there. The Naraki beings do not even have the slightest bit of happiness. They burn day and night in the fire of suffering.

26. Question: Where are the birthplaces (places of origin) of hell beings located, and what are their width, height, and shape? Answer: The birthplaces of hell beings are located in the upper part of the hell pits, equipped with various types of swords, round inside, and with a downward-facing throat. The width of the birthplaces from the first earth to the seventh earth is one kos, two kos, three kos, one yojana, two yojana, three yojana, and one hundred yojana respectively. The height is five times their body size. The birthplaces are of various shapes such as uṣṭrikā, koṭhalī, kumbhī, mudgara, nālī, gāy, hāthī, ghoṛā, nāv, jhālar, masūra, dhvaja, śṛgāla, khara, karabha, jhūlā, rīcha, etc. The birthplaces have seven, three, two, one, and five corners. 27. Question: What do the hell beings born in the birthplaces do? Answer: The hell beings, born in the birthplaces of the hell pits, complete their destinies in one antamuhūrta and are expelled from the birthplaces.

---------------------------
They fall upon the sharp weapons of the hellish realm. As the hell-bound beings fall from the first earth to the seventh earth, they bounce back up, respectively, 7 yojanas 3 kosas, 15 yojanas 2 kosas, 31 yojanas 1 kosa, 62 yojanas 2 kosas, 125 yojanas, 250 yojanas, and 500 yojanas. Then they fall again upon the weapons. The old hell-bound beings, seeing the new ones, beat them with harsh words, and then they begin to fight amongst themselves. 

Question 28: What do the hell-bound beings eat? How much suffering does that food cause?

Answer: The hell-bound beings of the first earth eat dirt that is even more foul-smelling than the decaying bodies of dogs and other low-born creatures. The hell-bound beings of the subsequent earths eat dirt that is infinitely more foul-smelling, and they receive only a small amount of it.

The dirt that the hell-bound beings of the first layer, called "Seemant," of the first hell eat, if placed in the human realm, would kill all living beings within half a kosa with its stench. Similarly, the dirt of each layer has the capacity to kill living beings within half a kosa more than the previous layer. With each layer, the capacity to kill increases by half a kosa, and in the seventh layer...

Page #28:
---------------------------
The earth, in the 46th layer called Adadhi Sthana, has soil that the Naraki (hell beings) consume. This soil, due to its foul smell, has the power to kill beings within a radius of 243 Kos in the Madhyaloka. 

29. Question: What is the range of the Naraki's Avadhijnana (clairvoyance)?
Answer: The Naraki of Ratnaprabha earth can perceive up to 4 Kos with their Avadhijnana. The Naraki of Sharkaraprabha can perceive up to 33 Kos, Balukaprabha up to 3 Kos, Pankaprabha up to 21 Kos, Dhumaprabha up to 3 Kos, Tamama up to 13 Kos, and the Naraki of Mahatamah Prabha can only perceive up to 1 Kos. They cannot perceive beyond this range.

30. Question: Can the Naraki know through their Avadhijnana where they will be born in the next life and where they were in the previous life?
Answer: The Naraki's Avadhijnana has a maximum range of one Yojana, and their perception of time is limited to one Muhurta. When a Naraki dies, they are reborn in the Madhyaloka, and similarly, beings from the Madhyaloka are reborn in Naraka. This distance is much greater than one Yojana, exceeding the range of their Avadhijnana. Therefore, the Naraki cannot know where they will be reborn after death or where they were in their previous life.

Page #29:
---------------------------
31. Question: What is the difference in birth and death in the first and subsequent earths? Answer: The difference in birth and death in the first and subsequent earths is respectively twenty-four muhurtas, seven days, one fortnight, one month, two months, four months and six months. That is, if a naraki does not experience birth and death in the first and subsequent earths, then he will not experience it for a maximum of this much time. Beyond this, according to the rule, everyone experiences birth and death.

Question: Where do the naraki beings who come out of hell originate from and where do they not originate from? What can they not become after coming out of hell? Answer: A being who comes out of hell is a karmabhumij, sanjni, paryaptak and garbhj in the human and animal realms, and a being who comes out of the seventh earth is a karmabhumij, sanjni, paryaptak and garbhj animal.
Beings who come out of hell do not become Narayana, Pratinarayana, Balabhadra and Chakravarti. Beings who come out of the fourth and subsequent earths become, in order, Tirthankara, Charmashiri, Sakalasanyami and Mishratraya.

34. Question: Which beings are not born in the hells? Which beings can be born in which hells? Answer: One-sensed and विकलत्रय beings are not born in the hells. Non-conscious five-sensed beings are born in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh earths, respectively. 

The beings with six संहनन, if born in hell, can be born up to the third earth called मेघा. The beings with five संहनन, without असंप्राप्तासृपाटिका संहनन, can be born up to the fifth earth called अरिष्टा. The beings with four संहनन, i.e., अर्धनाराच संहनन, can be born up to the sixth earth called मघवी. The beings with वज्रवृषभ नाराच संहनन can be born up to the seventh earth.

35. Question: How many times can beings be born in the first and subsequent earths? Answer: The above-mentioned non-conscious beings, if born continuously in the first and subsequent earths, can be born a maximum of eight, seven, six, five, four, three, and two times, respectively. They can go directly from hell to hell, so an interval of other पर्याय is required in between. For example, a non-conscious being may die and 
(22)

Page #32:
---------------------------
First, he went to the first hell. From there, he obtained the *sanjñi* state. Again, he died and became *asanjñi*. And dying again, he went to the first hell. This happened once. Again, he came out from there, became *sanjñi*, died, and obtained the *asanjñi* state, and died again, and went to hell. This happened the second time. In this way, he can be born a maximum of eight times. The being that comes out of hell does not become *asanjñi*, therefore, he has to obtain the *sanjñi* state in between. For this reason, even though there is a difference of one state in between, it is said to be continuous. This rule does not apply to reptiles, birds, snakes, lions, and women. They can be born without any difference of state in between. The fish will go to the seventh hell, and coming out from there, it will first become a *garbhaja*, then it will die as a fish and go to the seventh hell, because the being that comes out of hell does not become unconscious. Similarly, a human being will die and go to the seventh hell, then die and become a *tiryanch* *garbhaja*, then become a human being, then die and become a *tiryanch* *garbhaja*, then again, the human being will die and go to the seventh hell, because the being of the seventh hell is not a human being. For this reason, even though there is a difference of one state in between these two beings, it is said to be continuous.

36.
Question: What are the means of attaining *samyagdarshan* in the first and other earths?
(23)

Page #33:
---------------------------
Answer: The inner means of attaining Samyagdarshan is the subsidence, destruction and destruction-subsidence of the seven natures: Anantanubandhi Krodha, Mana, Maya, Loma, Mithyatva, Samyagmithyatva and Samyaktva. In the hellish realm, there is no capacity to destroy the aforementioned seven natures.

With respect to the outer means, some hell beings attain Samyagdarshan from the third earth onwards due to birth-remembrance, some due to hearing the Dharma, and some due to the experience of intense pain. From the fourth earth to the seventh earth, some attain Samyagdarshan due to birth-remembrance and some due to the experience of intense pain.

The familiar Devas from the previous birth go to the third earth and preach Dharma to the hell beings, therefore, hearing the Dharma is possible there. Beyond that, the Devas do not go, and the environment of the realm is not conducive, and due to the lack of a sense of benevolence, the Samyagdarshi hell beings there do not address other hell beings, therefore, hearing the Dharma is not possible there.

Question 37: In which of the Prithvis (earths) is which Samyagdarshan found?

Answer: In the first earth, all three Samyagdarshans (Upshama, Kshayika, Kshayopa-shama) are found in the hell beings in their sufficient state, and in their insufficient state, only Upshama Samyagdarshan is found.

Page #34:
---------------------------
In the state of inclusion and the deceased group, Ametha's Shayogic Samyagdarshan is found. In the inadequate state of the Narakas of the second and subsequent Earths, there is no Samyagdarshan because the Samyagdristi Jiva is not born beyond the first Earth. In the adequate state, both Upshama and Kshayopama Samyagdarshan are found. 38. Question: What is the inferior, medium and superior lifespan of the Narakas of the first and subsequent Earths? Answer: The superior lifespan of the Narakas of the first and subsequent Earths is one ocean, three oceans, seven oceans, ten oceans, seventeen oceans, twenty-two oceans and thirty-three oceans respectively. The superior state of the previous Naraka, which is one time more, becomes the inferior lifespan of the next Naraka. The inferior lifespan of the first Earth is ten thousand years. There are many options for the medium lifespan. 36. Question: What is the order of lifespan increase of the Narakas in the layers of the first and subsequent Earths? Answer: There are thirteen layers in the first Earth. The inferior and superior lifespans in them are as follows: Name of the layer Inferior lifespan Superior lifespan 1. Simantaka 10,000 years 90,000 years (25)

Similarly, in the earths like Sharkaraprabha etc., one should know the lifespan of the Narakas in each layer. The method is as follows: Subtract the lowest position from the highest position, divide the remainder by the number of layers. Add the quotient to the highest position of the previous earth. By doing this, the highest position of the first layer of the second earth is obtained. Further, this quotient should be added continuously.

Just as the **Shukra Prabha**'s highest state is 3 **Sagara** and the lowest state is 1 **Sagara**. Subtracting the lowest state from the highest state leaves 2 **Sagara**. Dividing this by the **Pratar** number 11 results in 2/11. Adding this to the age of each **Pal** gives the highest age of the **Narakas** located in the **Avantaar Patals**.

**Question:** What is the arrangement of the **Gunasthanas** of the **Narakas** in the hells?

**Answer:** Strong attachment to **Aarambha** and **Parigraha**, predominance of **Mithyatva**, **Roudradhyan**, consumption of **Madya**, **Mans**, and **Madhu**, disregard for **Devas**, **Shastras**, and **Gurus**, **Munihatya**, stealing of others' wealth, attachment to other's wives, etc.

Those who drink **Madya**, desire **Mans**, kill living beings, and are engaged in hunting, for the sake of momentary pleasure, generate **Papa**, cause great suffering, and fall into the most terrifying hell.

"**Upasthit Vishesh: Ravapratar Vibhajaroshta Sanganiatah. Upari Shiksha Rishvatiyutah Snesht Pratar Sthiti Garhati.**"
(Rajavatiya 3-6-7) (27)

---------------------------
The one who breaks through the wall, i.e., commits burglary, kills a loved one, and takes possession of clothes and other items, as well as the one who steals wealth and commits hundreds of other such injustices, the foolish people suffer in the terrifying hell.

The beings who are devoid of shame, intoxicated by lust, indulging in youthful pleasures, attached to other women's spouses, and engaging in sexual activities day and night, go to the hells and experience severe suffering.

Those who, for the sake of their son, wife, family, and friends, deceive others and increase their own greed, and steal the wealth of others, go to the hell that causes intense suffering.

---------------------------
Answer: The minimum measure of the length and width of the mansions is countless yojanas and the maximum measure is innumerable yojanas. All the mansions are square. Their height is three hundred yojanas. In the middle of each mansion, there is a mountain one hundred yojanas high and on each mountain, there is a chaityaalaya. The land and walls of the mansions are made of jewels. These mansions are constantly illuminated and are sprinkled with sandalwood and other things that give pleasure to all the senses. 

Question 54: Why are the hell-pits called pits and not mansions, even though they are made in the same way as the mansions in the Ratnapraba earth, below the Citraadi earths, in the vast majority of the space?

Answer: Just as here, the places of sinful beings like snakes are called pits and the places where virtuous humans live are called earth-houses, etc., in the same way, the places where the hellish beings who experience the fruits of inferior sin live are called pits and the places where the virtuous gods live are called mansions.

Question 55: How many artificial chaityaalayās are there in the Bhavanaloka?

These Devas take very delicious and unparalleled Amritmay food with their minds. 57. Question: Where do the Bhayanwasi Devas travel? Answer: All the Indraadi Devas, filled with devotion, go to the Dhaai Dweep for the purpose of Panch-Kalyanakas and to the Nandishwar Dweep for the purpose of worshipping the Jinenndra statues. Any of them, combined with qualities like Sheela, etc.

Page #45:
---------------------------
For the purpose of worshipping and examining the Munivara, for playing their own games, or for the desire to destroy the enemy group, the movement of the Asura Kumaras and other gods is upwards (without the help of others) to the Aishan heaven and with the help of other gods to the Achyut heaven. They can go down to the third earth. 58. Question: What is the highest and lowest lifespan of the Bhavanavasi gods? Answer: Among the Dakshinenras of the Bhavanavasi gods, (1) Chamar (2) Bhutananda (3) Venu (4) Purna and (5) Jalaprabha etc. six gods have the highest lifespan of 1 Sagar, 3 Paly, 23 Paly, 2 Paly and 13 Paly respectively.

The lowest lifespan of the Bhavanavasi goddess is 10,000 years! 56. Question: What is the strength of the Bhavanagasi gods in relation to their lifespan? Answer: The god who has a lifespan of ten thousand years, he...

Page #46:
---------------------------
A deva with the strength of one hundred humans is capable of killing or crushing them, and he is also capable of encircling and uprooting an area as large as one hundred and fifty bows in length, width, and thickness with his arms.

A deva with a lifespan of one *palyopam* is capable of uprooting the six continents of the earth and killing or crushing the humans and animals living there.

A deva who lives for a *sagaropama* period is capable of uprooting and destroying the entire Jambudvipa and killing or crushing the humans and animals living there.

A deva whose lifespan is *sankhyat* years travels *sankhyat* yojanas in one moment and returns the same distance.

A deva whose lifespan is *asankhyat* years travels *asankhyat* yojanas in one moment and returns the same distance.

**Question:** What is the extent of the *avadhijnana* of the *bhavanavasi* devas in the upward, downward, and horizontal directions?

**Answer:** The *avadhijnana* of the *bhavanavasi* devas residing in their respective *bhavanas* extends upwards to the peak of Mount Meru.

Page #47:
---------------------------
It concerns the field up to the limit. It tends downwards in a small area below their respective abodes and tends obliquely in a very large area without obstruction.
The evidence of the *avadhijnana* of the *bhavanavasi* gods is 25 *yojanas* in comparison to the field. It concerns objects within one day in comparison to time. The evidence of the *avadhijnana* of the *asurakumara* gods is, in comparison to the field and time, respectively, countless crores of *yojanas* and countless years only. The evidence of the *avadhijnana* of the remaining gods is, in comparison to the field and time, respectively, countless thousands of *yojanas* and a number-times less than the time of the *asurakumara* gods. 61. Question: What is the *utsedha* of the *bhavanavasi* gods and how much is their *vikriya*? Answer: The height of the body of the *asurakumara* gods is 25 *dhanus* and the height of the remaining gods is only 10 *dhanus*. The ten types of *bhavanavasi* gods perform *vikriya* in many forms, fulfilling the field of their respective *avadhijnana*. The height of their bodies created by *vikriya* is of many types. 62. Question: How is *kamasavana* performed in the *bhavanatrik*?

Page #48:
---------------------------
Answer: The Bhavanatrik Devas are endowed with Kay-Pravichar and when they experience the arousal of Ved-Nokashay, they experience sensual pleasure like humans.
Due to the absence of the seven dhatus, their virility is certainly not depleted. Only when the arousal of Ved-Nokashay subsides, they experience the pleasure of Sankalpa. 63. Question: Whom do the Bhavanavasi Devas worship? Answer: Devas endowed with the jewel of Samyagdarshan, for the purpose of Karmakshay, constantly worship the Jinenndra-pratima with great devotion, but the Mithyadrishti Devas, addressed by the Samyagdristi Devas, also worship the Jinenndra-pratima daily in various ways, considering them as Kul-Devatas. 64. Question: What are the causes of birth among the Bhavanavasi Devas? Answer: Many Aviniyaji Jivas with strong doubts in knowledge and character, with Sanklesha parinamas, with faulty character, following the wrong path, endowed with Nidana Bhavas, with the predominance of sins, afflicted by the fever of separation from the beloved, fond of quarrels and sinful, and many Sanjni and Asanjni Jivas with Mithyatva Bhava are born among the Bhavanavasi. Those who are attached to anger, pride, deceit and greed, with bad character,

Page #49:
---------------------------
They are **yal** and have an interest in **bair** भाव; they are born in the **asuras**.
-
65. What are the causes of birth in **dev-durgatis**?
Answer: Due to the violation of **samadhi-maran**, many beings are born in **dev-durgatis** such as **kandarpa**, **kilvish**, **abhiyogya**, and **sammoh**.
Those who are devoid of truthful speech, laugh at the multitude, and whose hearts are attached to **kama**, are surely born in **kandarpa** देवों.
Those who are associated with **bhootikam**, **mantra-abhiyog**, and **kautukaladi**, and are inclined to deceive people, are born in **vahan** देवों.
Beings who are hostile towards **tirthankar**, **sangha-pratima**, and **agam granthadi**, are **durvinayi**, and **pralap** are born in **kilvish** देवों.
Those who preach **kumarg**, are opposed to the path taught by **jinendra**, and are deluded by **moh**, are born in **sammoh** जाति देवों.

76. Question: Why do Kinnaras, Kimpurushas, and Pisachas not accept these designations due to their desire for wicked humans, their lust for ugly men, and their consumption of meat, respectively? Answer: It is not appropriate to consider the designations of Kimpurusha, etc., as arising from their actions in the Vyantara realm. All of this is simply a description of the Devas. These Devas possess pure, Vaikriya bodies. They never desire impure, Audarika-bodied humans, nor do they engage in the consumption of meat, alcohol, etc. The stories heard in the world about the Vyantaras consuming meat, etc., are merely their play. Their true sustenance is mental. The specific designations of Kinnara, etc., arise from the progressive differentiation of the nature of the Karma called Devagati. 80. Question: What Leshya is present in the Bhavanatrik Devas? Answer: The Bhavanatrik Devas and Devis possess Krishna, Neel, Kapota, and, in the lowest, Peeta Leshya. All Devas share the same Dravya and Bhava Leshya. (17)

Page #57:
---------------------------
81. Question: Which **Samyagdarshan** are present in **Bhavantrik Devas**?
Answer: In **Bhavantrik Devas**, there is no **Samyagdarshan** in the **Apyapt** state. In the **Paryapt** state, **Aupashmik** and **Kshayopashmik Samyagdarshan** can be newly attained. **Bhavantrik Devas** do not originate with **Samyagdarshan**.

52. Question: Which **Gunasthanas** are present in **Bhavantrik Devas**?
Answer: In **Bhavantrik Devas**, in the **Apyapt** state, there are two **Gunasthanas**: **Mithyatva** and **Sasadan**.

It is also said: "**Bhavanavasi**, **Danavantar**, **Joisiya** Devas and their Devis, **Soudharm** and **Aishan** **Kalpavasini** Devis, all these are **Mithyadristi** and **Sasadan Samyagdristi Gunasthanas**, both **Paryapt** and **Apyapt**.

(Dhaval - / 337 Sutra 66) Meaning: **Bhavanavasi**, **Danavantar**, **Joisiya** Devas and their Devis, **Soudharm** and **Aishan** **Kalpavasini** Devis, all these are **Mithyadristi** and **Sasadan Samyagdristi Gunasthanas**, both **Paryapt** and **Apyapt**.

(Shat .. Khandagam Mula 66 and Dhaval /337, Dhaval 6/442, Dhaval 6/466-67 etc.) Therefore, in **Bhavantrik Devas**, in the **Apyapt** state, there are two **Gunasthanas**: **Mithyatva** and **Sasadan**. This should be known.

(Ti. P. 3/85) Go.Ji./Ji.Pr. and Kannada Tika Ga, 726. Page 684. Part-2 Gyanapith Prakashan, Dhaval 2/546-47 etc.)

And the Sāsādana Guṇasthāna is there. In the sufficient state, there can be one to four Guṇasthānas. 53. Question: In which Bhavanatrik Devas are born? Answer: Akāmanirjarā and those who do Bālatap, Mithyādṛṣṭi humans, and Tiryañc are born in Bhavanatrik Devas. 84. Question: Where are Bhavanatrik Devas born? Answer: Bhavannik Devas are born here from Ayakar Karmabhūmija humans and Tiryañc. At the time of Āyu-bandha, if there is intense Saṁkleśa Bhāva, then except for Agnīkāyik and Vāyukāyik, they can also be born in the remaining Bādar Ekaindriyas. They are not born in Vikalatrai. 65. Question: Why is the astrological designation of Devas? Answer: Surya, Chandra, Graha, Nakshatra, and Tāragana, these five types of Devas are Jyotirmaya. Since their nature is to illuminate, the astrological designation of these five Devas is meaningful. 86. Question: Where do the Jyotiṣī Devas reside? Answer: From a height of 760 Yojanas from the Chitra Earth to a height of 600 Yojanas, that is, in the square of Rāju, one hundred and ten.

Page #59:
---------------------------
Multiplying by yojanas (1 raju x 1 raju x 110 yojanas), the resulting area, excluding the inaccessible region, is the abode of the celestial deities. The lowest star constellations are seven hundred and ninety yojanas above the flat part of the earth. Ten yojanas above them are the sun in the Pratyindra region, and eighty yojanas above that is the moon in the Indra region. Three yojanas above the moon are the stars, and three yojanas above the stars is the position of Mercury. Three yojanas above Mercury is Venus, three yojanas above Venus is Jupiter, one yojana above Jupiter is Mars, and four yojanas above Mars is Saturn. Thus, this entire celestial cycle is located in the sky, with a height of one hundred and ten yojanas and an immeasurable length of island groups, or a vast expanse of air, extending one raju in length from east to west and one raju in width from south to north. 

**Question 17:** What is the measure of the inaccessible region? 

**Answer:** According to Triloksar Gatha 345, "The celestial bodies travel leaving behind Mount Sumeru, which is 1121 yojanas." This measure of the two sides of Sumeru, devoid of the movement of celestial deities, is (1121 x 2) = 2242 yojanas. The extent of Sumeru on the earth is 10,000 yojanas. Adding these two together, the celestial deities' 
(50)

Page #60:
---------------------------
The diameter of the Agamya Kshetra is 10,000 + 2242 = 12,242 yojanas. The volume of the Agamya Kshetra = (12,242) x 10 x 4 x 12.343 x 110 yojanas = 13032625015 cubic yojanas. This is the measure of the Agamya Kshetra.

**Question 58:** What is the characteristic of the movement of the Jyotish Devas?

**Answer:** The Jyotish Devas related to the Jambudvipa, Lavanas, Batamoram, Baloddi Samudra, and the Ardha Pushkaravar Dvipa, that is, two and a half Dvipas and two Samudras, continuously circumambulate Mount Meru, leaving 1121 yojanas from Mount Meru. The Jyotish Devas of the outer region are situated outside this. The division of time is done by the Jyotish Devas who are engaged in motion. Except for the Moon, Sun, and planets, the remaining constellations and stars always move in the same path.

60. Question: What is the form of the celestial deities and Rahu, Ketu's planes and how many rays do they have? Answer: Just as if two halves of a sphere are placed upright, the wider part is above and the narrow round part is below, in the same way, the planes of the celestial deities are situated like an upright hemisphere. Only the lower circular part of the planes is visible to us. The planes of the celestial deities are terrestrial.
Rahu's plane moves below the moon's plane and Ketu's plane moves below the sun's plane. Every six months, at the end of the fortnight, i.e., at the end of the full moon and new moon, Rahu covers the moon and Ketu covers the sun, this is called an eclipse. The moon's rays are twelve thousand in number and are cool. The sun's rays are also twelve thousand, but they are sharp (hot). Venus's rays are two thousand five hundred, they are intense, i.e., bright with light. The rays of the remaining celestial deities are dim.

62. Question: What is the mutual difference between the Jyotishka Vimanas?
Answer: The minimum difference between the stars is one-seventh of a Kos, the medium difference is fifty Kos and the excellent difference is one thousand Yojanas. The minimum difference between the Sun and the Sun and the Moon and the Moon is 66,640 Yojanas, the excellent difference is 1,00,660 Yojanas. (Ra. Va. 4) 63. Question: How many Jyotishi Devas are there outside the Ardha-dvipa and where are they located?
Answer: In the first ring of the outer part of the Pushkarardha Dvipa, there are 144 Chandras and 144 Suryas, and in the second and subsequent rings, there is an increase of four from the first and subsequent rings. In the beginning of the islands and oceans of the east-east, the number of Chandras and Suryas is doubled in the beginning of the islands and oceans of the north. For example, in the first ring of the Pushkarardha Dvipa, there are 144-144 Chandras and Suryas, in the first ring of the Pushkaravar Ocean, there are 288-288 Chandras and Suryas, etc.
M
Going 50,000 Yojanas from the Manushoत्तर Mountain, there are 144-144 Chandras and Suryas in the first ring of the Bahuy Pushkarardha. Going one lakh Yojanas ahead from the first ring, there are Chandras and Suryas in the second and subsequent rings with an increase of four in each. Similarly
(56)

C
The first ring is 50,000 yojanas from the base of the altar of the oceans, and after that, the second and subsequent rings are one lakh yojanas each. The number of Jyotishi Devas is innumerable (Ra. Va. 4/13/4)
64.
Question: What is the area of movement of the Moon and Sun in relation to the human realm?
Answer: The area of movement of the Moon and Sun is called a "Chakshetra". There are four Chakshetras for each pair of Moon and Sun. There is one Chakshetra for the two Suns of Jambudvipa. There are two Chakshetras for the four Suns of the Lavanasamudra, six Chakshetras for the twelve Suns of the Dhataki-khandadvipa, twenty-one Chakshetras for the forty-two Suns of the Kalodak Samudra, and thirty-six Chakshetras for the seventy-two Suns of the Pushkarardha Dvipa.
The Moon and Sun related to Jambudvipa move only within a 180 yojana area in Jambudvipa. The remaining 330 yojanas are traversed in the Lavana Samudra, meaning that the two Moons and two Suns move in a total area of 51066 yojanas. The remaining Moons and Suns up to Pushkarardha move in their respective areas.
The Chakshetra, which is 510 yojanas in size, has 15 lanes for the Moon and 184 lanes for the Sun. Of these, the two Moons

And both suns communicate in one street (Vithi) daily. 65. Question: How do you end the circumstances with dissimilar evidence in the same time as the sun and moon? Answer: The sun and moon travel like an elephant in the first Vithi, like a horse in the middle Vithi, and like a lion in the last Vithi. That is, they go from the beginning Vithi with a fast speed and come back from the outer Vithi with a slow speed. In this way, they complete the uneven Vithis in the same time. 66. Question: How do the astrological gods travel? Answer: Among the astrological gods, the moon has the slowest movement, the sun is faster than the moon, the planets are faster than the sun, the stars are faster than the planets, and the constellations are even faster. The moon travels 4,22,7671 miles in one minute in the inner Vithi. The sun travels 4,37,6230 miles in one minute in the inner Vithi. 67. Question: What happens from the movement of the astrological gods? Answer: The division of time happens from the movement of the astrological gods. The inner (first) Vithi of 180 yojanas near the altar of Jambudvipa

When the Sun travels in its orbit, the day is 18 muhurtas (14 hours 24 minutes) and the night is 12 muhurtas (6 hours 36 minutes). However, when the Sun is at its final periphery (bina), the day is 12 muhurtas and the night is 18 muhurtas. In the month of Shravan, the Sun is located in the Cancer zodiac and travels in the inner periphery. In the month of Magh, the Sun is located in the Capricorn zodiac and travels in the outermost periphery. The difference in distance and speed of the Sun causes the days to be shorter or longer. The two Suns complete one orbit in 30 muhurtas.

**Question 68:** What is Dakshinayan and Uttarayana?

**Answer:** When the Sun is located in the first path (veethi), it is the beginning of Dakshinayan. When it is located in the last path, it is the beginning of Uttarayana. From the month of Shravan to the month of Paush (183 days), the Sun is in Dakshinayan. From the month of Magh to the month of Ashadh (183 days), the Sun is in Uttarayana. The beginning of Dakshinayan marks the beginning of the five rainy seasons (panch varshatmak yug).

**Question 66:** How far does the Sun's heat extend?

**Answer:** The diameter of Jambudvipa is 50,000 yojanas. This is half the diameter of Jambudvipa when the Sun is in the inner path (ubhyantar veethi).

Page #69:
---------------------------
The proof of the four regions related to the **Samvadi** is 180 yojanas. Subtracting this from 50,000 yojanas (50,000 - 180) = 46,820 yojanas remain. Therefore, the sun's heat extends 46,820 yojanas (16,62,80,000 miles) north from the center of Mount Meru to the **Abhyantara Vithi**.

The diameter of the **Lavana Samudra** is 2,00,000 yojanas. One-sixth of this (2,00,000 / 6) = 33,333 yojanas. Adding the proof of the four regions related to the **Samvadi**, 180 yojanas (33,333 + 180) = 33,513 yojanas. Therefore, the sun's heat extends 33,513 yojanas (1,420,533,333 miles) south from the **Abhyantara Vithi** to one-sixth of the **Lavana Samudra**. The same should be applied to other **Vithis**.

The **Chitra Prithvi** is 800 yojanas below the sun's disc and the root of the **Chitra Prithvi** is 1000 yojanas. The sun's heat extends downwards (1000 + 800) = 1800 yojanas (72,00,000 miles).

The **Jyotirloka** is 100 yojanas above the sun's disc. Therefore, the sun's heat extends upwards 100 yojanas (4,00,000 miles).

100. Question: How is an Adhik Maas (extra month) achieved in two and a half years?
Answer: There are 184 galis (divisions) in the Sun's movement. The distance between two galis is two yojanas (8000 miles). The Sun enters from one gali to another, crossing the middle yojana. The time taken to cross these entire intervals is 12 days, because it takes one muhurta (48 minutes) to cross one interval in a day. Therefore, in one day, there is one muhurta, in thirty days (one month) there are 30 muhurtas, i.e., one day, in twelve months there are 12 days, in two and a half years there are 30 days (one month), and in five years, i.e., one yuga, there is an increase of two months.

101. Question: What is the minimum and maximum lifespan of the celestial deities?
Answer: The minimum lifespan of the celestial deities is one-eighth of a palya, and the maximum lifespan is slightly more than a palya. The maximum lifespan of the Moon is one lakh years plus one palya, Venus is one year plus one palya, Jupiter is one palya, Sun is one thousand years plus one palya, Mercury, Mars, and Saturn are half a palya each.
"
(61)

Page #71:
---------------------------
The excellent lifespan of stars and constellations is **palya**.
The lifespan of the **jyotishka devanganas** is half the lifespan of their respective **devas**. There are 32 **devis** for the lowest **devas**.

102. Question: What is the evidence of the **akrutrim chaityalayas** of the **jyotishka vimanas**? Answer: There are countless **vimanas** of the **jyotishka devas**, each with one **akrutrim chaityalaya**, therefore the number of **akrutrim chaityalayas** is also countless.

103. Question: What is the extent of the **avagahana** and **avadhigyan** of the bodies of the **jyotishka devas**? Answer: The height of the bodies of the **jyotishka devas** is seven **dhanush** in measure, and the extent of their **avadhigyan** is countless times greater than the **avadhigyan** of the **bhavanavasi devas**.

6. Shukra, 10. Shuk, 11. Shar, 12. Tahbar, 13. Bharat, 14. Pranat, 15. Aran and 16. Achyut. These are the names of the heavens, associated with the names of the Indras, with the association of the assembly called 'Sudharma' for Saudharma heaven and the rest.

The upper world is from Merutal to Siddhalok, which is 7 Raju in measure. Of this, the middle world is Muru measure, i.e., 1,00,040 yojanas. From the top of Meru, the beginning of heaven is from above, the thickness of a human hair, the measure of the best enjoyment land. From Merutal, in one and a half Raju, there is Saudharma-Aishan, above it, in one and a half Raju, there is Sanatkumar-Mahendra, above it, in half-half Raju measure, there are six other pairs in order. Thus, there are sixteen heavens in six Raju. Above the sixteen heavens, in one Raju, there are nine Graiveyak, nine Anudish and five Anuttar Vimanas. The number of heavens is sixteen. In the sixteen heavens, there is one Indra each in the first four heavens and the last four heavens, and in the middle eight heavens, there are two Indras each, i.e., one Indra between a pair, hence twelve kalpas are considered in relation to the Indras. 107. Question: Who are the nine Graiveyak? Why are they called Graiveyak?
(64)

Page #74:
---------------------------
Answer: The nine Graveyakas are as follows: 1. Sudarshan, 2. Amogh, 3. Suprabuddha, 4. Yashodhar, 5. Subhadra, 6. Suvishal, 7. Sumanas, 8. Saumanas, 9. Pritikar.
Thus, there are three Graveyakas each in the lower, middle, and upper regions, making a total of nine Graveyakas.
The Lokakasha is considered to be a human form, and the region of the neck of that Lokapurusha is called the Griva, and the Vimanas in the Griva are called Graveyaka Vimanas.
108. Question: Who are the nine Anudishas and how are they situated?
Answer: 1. Archi, 2. Archimalini, 3. Vaer, 4. Vaerochan, 5. Som, 6. Somprabha, 7. Ank, 8. Sphatik, 9. Aditya.
In the Aditya named Patala, the four categorized Vimanas, Archi, Archimalini, Vaer, and Vaerochan, are situated in the East, South, West, and North directions respectively. The four categorized Vimanas, Som, Somprabha, Ank, and Sphatik, are situated in the four Vidishas respectively. In the middle of all these is the Indraka Vimana named Aditya. Thus, these are the nine Anudish Vimanas.
(65)

---------------------------
106. Question: What are the Anuttara Vimanas? Why are they called Vijay etc. and how are they situated?
Answer: These Anuttara Vimanas are as follows: 1. Vijay, 2. Vaijayanta, 3. Jayanta, 4. Aparajita and 5. Sarvarthasiddhi.
The Devas who reside in the Vijay, Vaijayanta, Jayanta and Aparajita Vimanas do not wander in the world for more than two or three Bhavas, therefore, their names Vijay etc. are meaningful because they have conquered the world.
The Devas who reside in the Sarvarthasiddhi Vimana are Ekabhavatari, because they have attained the Siddhi of all things, therefore, its name is Sarvarthasiddhi.
In the Sarvarthasiddhi Patala, the four categories of Vimanas, Vijay, Vaijayanta, Jayanta and Aparajita, are situated in the East etc. directions, one each. In the middle of these is the Sarvarthasiddhi Indraka Vimana. 150. Question: Where is the Ashtama Prithvi and what is its extent etc.?
Answer: From the Dhwajadanda of the Sarvarthasiddhi Indraka Vimana, going up twelve Yojanas, there are successively twenty thousand thick Dhanadadhi, Dhan and Tanu Vatavalayas. After this, i.e., on the top of the three Lokas, is the

---------------------------
The eighth earth is called Iṣatprāgbhāra. Its width (east-west) is one rāju, its length (north-south) is seven rāju, and its thickness is eight yojanas. 111. Question: Where is the Siddha-kṣetra? Answer: In the middle of the eighth earth, there is a Siddha-kṣetra called Iṣatprāgbhāra, which is shaped like an umbrella facing upwards and is the size of the human realm, i.e., 45,00,000 yojanas wide. Its outer edge is 8 yojanas in the middle and gradually decreases towards the ends, leaving only one angula at each end. In the upper part of this Siddha-kṣetra, in the thin layer of the atmosphere, i.e., in the last 525 dhanuṣa of the realm, there reside countless Siddha-parameṣṭhis. 112. Question: How many natural temples are there in the upper realm? Answer: There are a total of 84,67,023 vimānas in the upper realm. Each vimāna has one Jina-mandir, so the total number of Jina-mandirs in the upper realm is also 84,67,023. 113. Question: How are the vimānas of heaven constructed? Answer: The vimānas of heaven are of three types: Indraka, Śreṇībaddha, and Prakīrṇaka. The Indraka vimāna is in the middle, the Śreṇībaddha 
(67)

Page #77:
---------------------------
The Vimanas are situated in the directions and the scattered Vimanas are scattered in the intervals of the categorized Vimanas like flowers scattered here and there.
The Indrak Vimanas are of a certain number of Yojanas in extent, the categorized Vimanas are of innumerable Yojanas in extent, and the scattered Vimanas are of some certain number of Yojanas in extent and some of innumerable Yojanas in extent.
114. Question: What is the total number of layers in the heavens? Or, what is the number of Indrak Vimanas in the heavenly heavens? And where and how many Indraks are there?
Answer: The total number of layers in the heavens is 63. Since there is one Indrak Vimana in each layer, the number of Indrak Vimanas is also 63.
There are 31 Indraks in the Saudharma couple, 7 in the Sanatkumar couple, 4 in the Brahma couple, 2 in the Lantva couple, 2 in the Shukra couple, 1 in the Shukra couple, 1 in the Shatar couple, 6 Indraks in the four Kalpas of Anatadi, 3 Indraks in the three lower Graveyakas, 3 Indraks in the three middle Graveyakas, 3 Indraks in the three upper Graveyakas, one in the nine Anudishas, and one Indrak Vimana in the five Anuttaras.

---------------------------
**Question 115:** What is the nature of the arrangement of the categorized celestial abodes (vimanas)?

**Answer:** In the first celestial abode (Indraka) called Ritu, which is the size of the human realm (Manush Kshetra), i.e., 45,00,000 yojanas in extent, there are 62 categorized vimanas in each of the four directions.  Moving forward, in the second, third, fourth, and subsequent Indrakas, they decrease by one (61, 60, 59, etc.) successively, until only one categorized vimana remains in each of the four directions of the longitudinal and latitudinal Indrakas. The final Indraka called Sarvarthasiddhi, which is the size of Jambudvipa, i.e., 1,00,000 yojanas in extent, has one categorized vimana in each of the four directions.

**Question 116:** On what basis are all the vimanas situated in the sky?

**Answer:** The vimanas of the Saudharmeshana Kalpa are situated above water. The vimanas of the Sanatkumara and Mahendra Kalpas are situated above air. The vimanas of the eight Kalpas from Brahma Swarga to Sahasrar Swarga are situated above both water and air. And all the vimanas from Anantadi to Sarvarthasiddhi are situated in pure space (akasha).

Page #79:
---------------------------
## Question 117: What are the characteristics of the Manastambha located in the heavens?

## Answer: 

In front of the assembly hall of the Indras, there is a vajra-made Manastambha, one yojana wide, thirty-six yojanas high, and with a pedestal. Its shape is round, with a diameter of one yojana. It has twelve streams, each one kos wide. The karandas established on the Manastambha in the Saudharma Kalpa are for the Tirthankaras of the Bharat Kshetra. The karandas established on the Padan in the Aishana Kalpa are for the Tirthankaras of the Airavat Kshetra. The karandas established on the Manastambha in the Sanatkumar and Mahendra Kalpas are for the Tirthankaras of the Purva Videha Kshetra and the Paschim Videha Kshetra respectively. All these karandas are established and worshipped by the Devas.

## Question 118: Where is the place of origin of Indra and other Devas and Devanganas?

## Answer: 

Near the Manastambha, Indra's Uppaad Griha is eight yojanas long, wide, and high. In the middle of it are two beds of jewels. All the Devanganas of the Dakshin Kalpas up to the Aran Svarga are born in the Saudharma Kalpa, and all the Devanganas of the Uttar Kalpas up to the Achyut Svarga are born in the Aishana Kalpa. After their birth, the Devas of the upper Kalpas take their respective Niyogini Devanganas with them.

Page #80:
---------------------------
They are taken to their respective places. In the Saudharma Kalpa, 6,00,000 Vimanas are pure, meaning only Devaganas are born in them. In the Aishana Kalpa, 4,00,000 Vimanas are pure. In these Kalpas, 26,00,000 and 24,00,000 Vimanas respectively, both Devas and Devaganas are born. The Devis go with the Niyogi Devas along with their original bodies. 116. Question: What is the nature of the birth of Devas? What special work happens after birth? What actions do Devas perform in the form of Satkaryas? Answer: Just as the sun rises in the east, in the same way, Devas are born on a comfortable bed and within a moment, they complete six perfections, acquire a fragrant, comfortable, and pure body. Knowing the birth of the new Deva, other Devas make sounds of joy, 'Jai Jai', and many praises. Hearing those words, seeing the wealth they have attained and their family, and knowing their previous birth through Avadhijnana, the new Devas praise Dharma and after bathing in the lake, they receive the Patta form of Abhishek and ornaments. The Samyagdristi Devas themselves (p)

Page #81:
---------------------------
Jineendra Bhagwan's Abhishek Pujan is performed by the Vidyadristi Dev and other Devas, and after that, they perform Jin-Pujan considering them as "Kuladevata". All these Devas are immersed in the ocean of happiness and therefore do not know their past time.
Kalpawasi Devas attend the Mahapuja of Tirthankaras and their Panchkalyanak Mahotsavs, but Ahminndra Dev remains in his own place and performs Namaskar by placing his hands on the Mani-may Mukuts. During the Garbha and Janmaadi Kalyanak, the Devas' Uttar Sharira go, while their original Sharira remain in their birthplaces peacefully.
120. Question: What happens in front of the Indras' Bhavanas?
Answer: In front of all the Indra-Prasads, there are Nyagrodha trees. Each of these trees is like the Earth and Jambhu tree.
At its root, there is a Jineendra Pratima in each direction, at whose feet the Indras and others perform Pranam, and which destroys sins just by remembering it.
121. Question: What is special about the Devas' bodies?
Answer: The Devas' bodies do not have nails, hair, or hair follicles. 
(72)

Page #82:
---------------------------
Skin and flesh are not present, nor is blood and fat, nor are there bones, nor excreta and urine, nor even nerves. Due to the influence of their meritorious karmas and the attainment of the supreme divine form, they possess excellent color, taste, smell, and touch.

The sequence of divine coitus in the heavens is as follows: From the Bhavanatrika heaven up to the Aishana heaven, the devas engage in physical coitus with their divine consorts. In the Sanaatkumara and Maahendra heavens, the devas become free from the pangs of desire merely by the touch of their divine consorts. In the heavens above them, the devas become free from the pangs of desire merely by the sight of their divine consorts. In the heavens above them, the devas become free from the pangs of desire merely by listening to the songs and other sounds of their divine consorts. In the Aanata and other four heavens, the devas become free from the pangs of desire merely by contemplating their divine consorts in their minds. Beyond this, all the Ahamindra devas of the Nava Graivayas up to the Sarvaarthasiddhi are devoid of divine coitus.

The range of the avadhi-jnana (clairvoyance) of the vaimanika (celestial) devas extends up to the first earth for the devas of the Saudharma and Aishana realms, up to the second earth for the devas of the Sanaatkumara and Maahendra realms, up to the third earth for the devas of the Brahma and other four realms, up to the fourth earth for the devas of the Shukra and other four realms, and up to the fifth earth for the devas of the Aanata and other four realms. Their vikrya-shakti (transformative power) is accordingly.

Page #83:
---------------------------
The Dev (gods) residing in the five earthly realms (Pṛthvī) can see up to the sixth earthly realm, while the nine Graiveyakavāsī Dev can see the entire Lokanāḍī (universe).
The Dev of each Kalpa (eon) cannot know anything beyond the area above the flagstaff of their respective Vimāna (celestial vehicle).
The extent of the knowledge of the Vaimānika Dev is the proof of their power of reaction.
Question 124: What is the order of Leshyā (color) in the Vaimānika Dev?
Answer: In Saudharma and Iśāna, there is a moderate amount of Pīta Leshyā (yellow color), in Sanatkumāra and Mahendra, there is an excellent amount of Pīta Leshyā with a negligible amount of Padma Leshyā (lotus color), in the six Brahmadik (Brahma and others), there is a moderate amount of Padma Leshyā, in the Shatar Yugal (pair of Shatar), there is an excellent amount of Padma Leshyā with a negligible amount of Shukla Leshyā (white color), in the four Ānatādi (Ānata and others) and the nine Graiveyakas, there is a moderate amount of Shukla Leshyā, and in the nine Anudiś (facing all directions) and five Anuttara (facing no direction) Vimānas, there is an excellent amount of Shukla Leshyā. Thus, these Leshyās are present in the Dev of the aforementioned heavens.
Question 125: In which aspects do the heavens have increasing abundance and decreasing abundance?
(74)

Page #84:
---------------------------
Answer: In the higher heavens, the duration of life, the influence, i.e., the curse and grace form of power, the happiness, i.e., the arising of the seven vedaniya karma, the experience of desired objects, the dhuti, i.e., the body, clothes, ornaments, etc., the revolution, leshya purity, sensory objects, and the subject of abhijnan, all these increase more and more.
Motion, body, possessions, and pride are less and less in the higher gods. 126. Question: How much is the span of the gods in the heavens? Answer: In the Saudharma-Aishana heaven, the span of the gods is 7 hands, in the Sanatkumara-Mahendra heaven, it is 6 hands, in the Brahma, etc., four heavens, it is 5 hands, in the Shukra, etc., four heavens, it is 4 hands, in the Ananta-Pranata heaven, it is 3 hands, in the Aran-Achyuta heaven, it is 3 hands, in the Adho Aveyaka, it is 23 hands, in the Madhyama Aveyaka, it is 2 hands, in the Uparima Graidheya and the nine Anudishas, it is 11 hands, and in the Anuttar Vimana, the span of the gods is 1 hand. 127. Question: What is the rule of food and breathing in the Vaimanika gods? Answer: In the Vaimanika gods, the number of years of the ocean is the number of thousands. (75)

Page #85:
---------------------------
The desire for food lasts for years and breathing takes place in as many breaths. 128. Question: What is the lifespan of the Vaimanika Devas? Answer: The excellent lifespan of the Devas in the Saudharma Yugal is slightly more than 2 Sagaras, in the Sanatkumar Yugal it is slightly more than 7 Sagaras, in the Brahma Yugal it is slightly more than 10 Sagaras, in the Lantva Yugal it is slightly more than 14 Sagaras, in the Shukra Yugal it is slightly more than 16 Sagaras, in the Shatar Yugal it is slightly more than 18 Sagaras, in the Anant Yugal it is 20 Sagaras, and in the Aran Yugal it is 22 Sagaras. The lifespan of the Devas in the first nine Graveyakas is 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 26, 30, and 31 Sagaras respectively. In the nine Anudishis, the excellent lifespan is 32 Sagaras, and in the five Anuttaras, it is 33 Sagaras. Here, the statement of "slightly more" up to the Shatar-Sahasrar heaven is in comparison to the Ghatayushk Devas.

The lowest lifespan of the Saudharma Yugal is one Paly, and from there onwards, the excellent lifespan of the lower heavens is the lowest lifespan of the higher heavens. In the Sarvarthasiddhi Devas, there is no lowest lifespan. In the Rarvarthasiddhi, the lowest lifespan is an innumerable part of a Paly, which is 33 Sagaras. Some Acharyas also say this. (Lokavibhag or Dasam Vibhag) Shlok 234, Page-202, Jain Sanskriti Sanrakshak Sangh, Solapur. (76)

Page #86:
---------------------------
It is so. Everyone's lifespan is 33 sagar. The lowest lifespan of the Devaganas is slightly more than one paly and the highest lifespan is 55 paly. 126. Question: Who are called Ghatayushk? Answer: Those who are born in the lower heavens due to the consequences of their past karmas, after being bound to a higher state, are called Ghatayushk. Such Devas are born only up to the Shatar-Sahasrar heaven, they are not born in the higher heavens. Therefore, the term "slightly more" is only applicable up to the Shatar-Sahasrar heaven. 130. Question: What is the arrangement of Ghatayushk in the Bhavanatrik Devas? Answer: A human being, during his state of restraint, bound himself to a Devayubandha. Later, he violated his restraint due to the consequences of his karmas and therefore, due to the force of the Apvartana Ghat, his lifespan was also reduced. Even if he is Samyagdristi after violating his restraint, he will be born in the next kalpa with a lifespan that is slightly less than the usual lifespan of that kalpa, but more than the average lifespan by an amount equivalent to a Sagar. Imagine a human being who, during his state of restraint, bound himself to a lifespan of twenty-two sagar in the Achyut kalpa. Later, 
(77)

Page #87:
---------------------------
By violating restraint and refracting the bound lifespan, he became an unrestrained Samyagdarshi. If he dies and is born in the Sahasrar Kalpa, his lifespan will be less than the lifespan of a Samyagdarshi deva by a fraction of a moment, even though the lifespan of a Samyagdarshi deva is equal to eighteen Sagars. If the same man violates restraint and becomes a Mithyadarshi by violating Samyaktva, and dies and is born in the same Sahasrar Kalpa, his lifespan will be greater than the lifespan of a Nidhi by an innumerable fraction of a Palpa. Such a being is called a Dhatayushk Mithyadarshi. 131. Question: How many and what are the types of Laukantic Devas? Where do they reside? Answer: There are 8 types of Laukantic Devas: 1. Sarasvat, 2. Aditya, 3. Vahini, 4. Arun, 5. Gardatoy, 6. Tusit, 7. Avyabadha, and 8. Arishta. They reside in circular, scattered Vimanas in the eight directions, starting with Aishana, at the end of Brahmaloka. 132. Question: What is the special characteristic of Laukantic Devas? (78)

Page #88:
---------------------------
Answer: The Laukantika Devas are all equal, devoid of any superiority or inferiority in terms of Riddhi, etc., detached from worldly objects, with their minds fixed on the Anupreksha, fourteen, Purvadhari and Nirmala Kalyana, and are eager to enlighten all three types of beings. 133. Question: Which Devas are Bhavaavatari? Answer: Saudharma Indra, his consort named Shachi, his four Lokapalas, Sanatkumar, etc., Dakshina Indra, all Laukantika Devas, and all Devas born in Sarvarthasiddhi, all fall from their respective positions and obtain the human birth, and attain Nirvana in the same Paryaya according to the rules. 134. Question: What is the rule of Samyagdarshan in Vaimanika Devas? Answer: In Vaimanika Devas, in the Paryaptak and Aparyaptak states, Aupashmik, Kshayik and Kshayopaashmik Samyagdarshan can occur. In the Aparyaptak state, Aupashmik Samyagdarshan occurs in relation to beings who die with Dvitiyopaashma Samyaktva. In the Aparyaptak state of Devangana, there is no Samyagdarshan at all. In the Paryaptak state, in relation to the new birth, Aupamik and Kshayopaashmik, these two Samyagdarshan can occur. The birth of a Mithyadrishti being can occur up to the ninth Graveyaka. In the Anudish and Anuttara Vimanas, only Samyagdrishtas are born. (76)

Page #89:
---------------------------
135. Question: Which beings can be born in which heavens?
Answer: Unrestrained Samyagdrsti and Desasanayami humans and Tiryanch can be born up to the sixteenth heaven. Those who are Nigrantha Mudra holders in terms of substance and Mithyadrsti, unrestrained Samyagdrsti and Desasanayami in terms of attitude, are born up to the final Graiveyak. Samyagdrsti Mahavrati are born up to Sarvarthasiddhi, Samyagdrsti Bhogbhumij humans and Tiryanch are born up to Saudharmeshana heaven, and Mithyadrsti Bhogbhumij humans, Tiryanch and Tapasi Sadhu are born up to Bhavanatrik with excellence. Charak and Parivrajaka Sannyasi are born up to Brahma Kalpa and Ajivika Sadhu are born up to Achyut Kalpa. The production of other Ligis does not go beyond the 16th heaven. Women can be born up to the 16th heaven. 136. Question: What are the results of Devayu-bandha? Answer: Those who are endowed with Sham, Dam, Yam and Niyam, who control their mind, speech and body, who have the result of Nirmamtav, and who are free from Aaramm etc., are Sadhu, Indra etc. or the five Anuttaras. They take the lifespan of the Mahardhik Devas. 1. Triloksar. P.- 466.
(60)

Page #90:
---------------------------
Those who are endowed with right knowledge and right austerity, possess the qualities of gentleness, are free from the three garvas and three shalyas, are not controlled by envy, jealousy, fear, and greed, maintain equanimity in pleasure and pain, friend and foe, are detached from the body, possess extreme dispassion, are free from the vices of attachment, etc., and diligently practice the fundamental and secondary virtues, bind the lifespan of the great, wealthy, and divine beings.

Those who give all four types of charity to the excellent, mediocre, and inferior recipients, and possess the moderate qualities of shame and decorum, bind the lifespan of the medium-wealthy, divine beings.

Beings who are deeply afflicted by the manifestation of knowledge and ignorance from time immemorial, have a corrupted character, are cruel, are on the wrong path, have a sense of attachment, and have weak passions, bind the lifespan of the lesser, half-wealthy, divine beings.

Question 137: What are the causes of the birth of the gods like Kandarpa, etc.? Answer: In the human realm, those beings who, while possessing the characteristics of sexual indulgence, etc., are associated with the Kandarpa results, are born as Kandarpa gods due to their appropriate good karma, and they are born until the end of the Ishana Kalpa, but not beyond. These gods are the lowest in the Ishana Kalpa.

Page #91:
---------------------------
They are endowed with a lifespan commensurate with their birth-realm. In the human realm, those beings whose livelihood is derived from activities like agriculture, etc., characterized by such [calvishik] consequences, are born as *kilvishik* gods for the duration of the *lantva* kalpa, and no longer. They too are endowed with a lifespan commensurate with their birth-realm. Similarly, in the human realm, those beings who engage in sinful activities, characterized by such [abhiyogy] consequences, i.e., those who perform tasks suitable for barbers, washermen, and servants, etc., with their own hands, are born as *abhiyogy* gods for the duration of the *achyuta* kalpa, and no longer. They too are endowed with a lifespan commensurate with their birth-realm. 138. Question: What is the power of the *vaimanik* gods? Answer: A god with a lifespan of one *palyopam* is capable of uprooting six continents of the earth and killing or nourishing the humans and animals residing therein. A god who lives for the duration of one *sagaropama* kalpa is capable of overturning Jambudvipa and killing or nourishing the humans and animals residing therein. (2)

Page #92:
---------------------------
136. Question: What is the nature of the bliss of the Siddhas? Answer: The bliss of the beings residing in the realm of enjoyment (Bhogabhumi) is infinitely greater than the bliss of a Chakravarti in the world. The bliss of a Dharanendra is infinitely greater than that of these beings. The bliss of a Devendr is infinitely greater than that of six Ranendras. The bliss of the Ahmindras is infinitely greater than that of a Devendr. Even compared to the trikala-vi (three-time) bliss of all these beings, the bliss of a Siddha for a single moment is infinitely greater, meaning there is no comparison to their bliss.

## Chaturthaadhikaara
## Tiryanchlok Adhikaara 140. Question: What is called the Sthavar Lok? Answer: As many living beings and pudgalas are in the sky, related to Dharma and Adharma dravya, that much, i.e., 343 ghan raju is the measure of Sthavar Lok. 141. Question: What is called the Tiryanchlok? Answer: From the base of Mandar Parvat, 1,00,000 yojan high raju pratar, i.e., a raju long and wide area, the Tiryanch-Trasalok is situated, or on the same ground, the group of innumerable islands and seas spread around is called Tiryanchlok. Along with the Sthavars, Trasa jivas are also found in this area. 142. Question: What is the number of innumerable islands and seas, and how are they situated? Answer: The number of both islands and seas is equal to the number of hairs on the twenty-five koda-kodi uddhar palya. Half of this, i.e., 121 koda-kodi uddhar palya, is the number of islands, and the same number is of seas.

Page #94:
---------------------------
In the Chitra Earth, which is a multi-layered earth, there are circular islands and seas situated within a spherical region, one surrounding the other. The first of these is the Jambudvipa island and the last is the Swayambhuraman sea. In between are countless islands and seas. All the seas are situated on the Vajra Earth and all the islands are situated on the Chitra Earth.

143. Question: What are the names of the first few islands and seas in the Tiryanch Lok? What is the taste of the water in the seas?

Answer: The first is Jambudvipa island, Lavana sea, Dhataki Khand island, Kalod sea, Pushkaravar island, Pushkaravar sea, Varunivar island, Varunivar sea, Kshiravar island, Kshiravar sea, Ghritavar island, Ghritavar sea, Kshaudravar island, Kshaudravar sea, Nandishwar island, Nandishwar sea... and the last is Swayambhuraman island and Swayambhuraman sea.

Varunivar, Lavanaadhi, Ghritavar and Kshiravar - these four seas have a taste according to their names. Kalod, Pushkaravar and Swayambhuraman - these three seas have a natural taste of water (the Pushkaravar sea has water like honey) and the remaining seas have a taste like sugarcane juice.

Page #95:
---------------------------
The *lavanod*, *kalod* and *antime swayambhuram* seas are the only ones that contain aquatic creatures. They are not found in the other seas.

144. Question: What is the extent of the island seas?
-
Answer: The extent of Jambudvipa is one lakh yojanas. From the *lavan* sea to the *swayambhuram* sea, the extent of the island seas doubles with each successive sea.

145. Question: What is the circumference of Jambudvipa?
Answer: The gross circumference of Jambudvipa is 3 lakh yojanas, and the subtle circumference is 3,16,227 yojanas, 3 kosas, 128 dhanushas and 133 angulas.

146. Question: What is the method for calculating the circumference?
Answer: The circumference is obtained by squaring the extent, multiplying it by ten, and then taking the square root of the result.

147. Question: How are the 52 artificial *chaityalaya* in Nandishvara dvipa?
Answer: In the eighth Nandishvara dvipa, which has an extent of one hundred sixty-four crore eighty-four lakh yojanas, there is one in each of the four directions.

Anjanagiri is a mountain. It is 1000 yojan deep, 84,000 yojan high and 84,000 yojan in circumference. There are four Vaapikas, each extending one lakh yojan in all four directions of the circular Anjanagiri. In the middle of each Vaapika, there is a round Dadhiमुख mountain, 1000 yojan deep, 10,000 yojan high and 10,000 yojan in circumference, with a color similar to curd. On both outer corners of the Vaapikas, there are two Ratikara mountains, each round, 250 yojan deep, 1000 yojan high and 1000 yojan in circumference.

Question: How many divisions are there in the Bharat region? (107)

Page #117:
---------------------------
Answer: In the middle of the Bharat Kshetra, there is the Vijayarth Parvat, which is long from east to west, dividing the region into two parts. The Ganga and Sindhu rivers, originating from the Padma Draha, flow from north to south, further dividing the Bharat Kshetra into six parts. The middle part in the south is the Arya Khand, and the remaining five are Mlechchha Khand. The Chakravarti is the ruler of these six Khand. Such a division into six Khand also exists in the Airavat Kshetra and each Videha Kshetra.

167. Question: Where is the Vijayarth Parvat located in the Bharat Kshetra, and what is its nature?
Answer: In the very middle of the Bharat Kshetra, there exists a magnificent Vijayarth Parvat, adorned with various types of precious gems, and shining like silver.

The Vijayadhar mountains are like fortresses. The Raktoda rivers, which flow through them, symbolize the half-conquest of the universe, hence the name Vijayadhar is meaningful. These Vijayadhar mountains have nine peaks, eight of which are inhabited by the Vyantar Devas. The ninth peak, the Siddhakut, houses the Jain temple. In the Bharat-Airavat region, the Vijayadhar mountains have caves and entrances through which the Ganga, Sindhu, Rakta, and Raktoda rivers flow into the oceans like the Lavana. Similarly, all the Vijayadhar mountains in the Videha region have the same structure. 

**Question:** Where and how does the Kalchakra change, and where does it not change?

**Answer:** In the Bharat and Airavat regions, the Kalchakra changes due to the Utsarpini and Avasarpini kalas. There are six divisions of each of the Utsarpini and Avasarpini kalas. The six divisions of the Avasarpini kala are: 

1. Sushama-Sushama
2. Sushama
3. Sushama-Dushsma
4. Dushsma-Sushama
5. Dushsma
6. Dushsma-Dushsma

The Sushama-Sushama kala lasts for four Koda-kodi sagaras, the Sushama kala for three Koda-kodi sagaras, the Sushama-Dushsma kala for two Koda-kodi sagaras, the Dushsma-Sushama kala for one Koda-kodi sagara minus 42,000 years, the Dushsma kala for 21,000 years, and the Dushsma-Dushsma kala for 21,000 years. Similarly, the Utsarpini kala also has six divisions:

Page #119:
---------------------------
Dushma - Dushma (2) Dushma (3) Dushma - Sushama (4) Sushama - Dushma (5) Sushama (6) Sushama - Sushama are the six types. In the Avasarpini Kala, there is a gradual decline in knowledge, strength, lifespan, and physical prowess. In the Utsarpini Kala, there is a gradual increase in knowledge, strength, lifespan, and physical prowess.

In the Videha Kshetra, the fourth Kala is always present. In the Haimvata and Haranya-vat Kshetra, the third Kala is always present. In the Hari-Ramya Kshetra, the second Kala is always present. And in the Devakuru-Uttarakuru, the first Kala is always present. In the Viy-ardha categories and the Mlechch Khandas, there is a change like the beginning and end of the fourth Kala of the Avasarpini. From beyond the Manushoत्तर Mountain to the east of the Swayamprabha Mountain, in countless islands and oceans, the third Kala is always present. In the Arth-Swayambhuraman Island and the Swayambhuraman Ocean, there is no change in the six Kalas. There, the fifth Kala is present.

200. Question: What is Bhogbhumi? Where and how are they created?
Answer: Where humans live on ten types of Kalpavriksha, it is called Bhogbhumi. This is of two types: stable and unstable. 
(110)

Page #120:
---------------------------
There are two types of Bhoga-bhumis. In Bharat and Airavat regions, the Kalchakra changes, hence the Bhoga-bhumis there are called unstable. Where the Kalchakra does not change, the Bhoga-bhumis are stable. 

There are three types of Bhoga-bhumis based on their quality: 1. Uttama, 2. Madhyama, and 3. Jaghanya.

In Devakuru and Uttar Kuru (parts of Videha), there is Uttama Bhoga-bhumi. In Uttama Bhoga-bhumi, humans have a height of 3 Kos, a lifespan of 3 Palyas, and they eat Badri fruit every 3 days.

In Hari and Ramyak regions, there is Madhyama Bhoga-bhumi. Here, humans have a height of 2 Kos, a lifespan of 2 Palyas, and they eat Baheda fruit every 2 days.

In Hemvat, Heranyavat regions, and in the countless islands and seas in the middle, there is Jaghanya Bhoga-bhumi. Here, humans have a height of 1 Kos, a lifespan of 1 Palyas, and they eat Amla fruit every day.

In Bharat and Airavat regions, the Kalchakra keeps changing. During the Sushama-Sushama period, there is Uttama Bhoga-bhumi, during the Sushama period, there is Madhyama Bhoga-bhumi, and during the Sushama-Dushshama period, there is Jaghanya Bhoga-bhumi.

Those who approve of donations are also born in the Bhoga-bhoomi as Tiryanch. 203. Question: What is the movement of Bhoga-bhoomi beings? That is, where are they born after death? Answer: Mithya-drishti humans and Tiryanch of the Bhoga-bhoomi are born in the Bhavanavasi, Vyantar, and Jyotishi Devas, while Samyag-drishti humans and Tiryanch are born in the Saudharma Yugal. 204. Question: What is the special characteristic of Bhoga-bhoomi Tiryanch? Answer: Bhoga-bhoomi Tiryanch are born in pairs. They are of the highest caste, have mild passions, and are simple in their results. They enjoy fruits, roots, grass, and sprouts according to their abilities.

There are eight islands near the two ends of the four mountains, Himavan Kulachal, Bharat-related Vijayarth, Shikhari Kulachal, and Airavat-related Vijaya. Thus, the total number of islands on the inner shore of the salt sea (4+4+8+8) = 24. There are also 24 islands on its outer side, so there are 48 islands related to the salt sea. Similarly, there are 48 islands on both shores of the Kalodak sea. Kubhogbhumi is formed in these 66 islands. The shapes of the humans there are of various types. Some humans have one leg, some have tails, some have long ears, some

Humans have faces resembling those of elephants, cows, and rams. Here, the inherent tendency of birth is like a vile pleasure ground. A single lifespan is the proof. They eat extremely coarse earth and fruits given by Kalpa trees. 207. Question: What are the causes of degeneration in the pleasure ground? Answer: Those beings who, while holding the Jinalinga, engage in worldly activities, earn a living through astrology and mantras, are desirous of wealth, possess three types of pride and four types of consciousness, perform marriages and other rituals for householders, are opposed to right faith, do not criticize their own faults, blame others, practice false faith and the five fires penance, eat without silence, and are filled with ill-will, impurity, pollution, etc., and are in contact with a woman adorned with flowers, and even while possessing the faults of "Jaisankradohin" (intercaste marriage) and other such faults, give charity, and give charity to unworthy recipients, these beings are born as wicked humans.
