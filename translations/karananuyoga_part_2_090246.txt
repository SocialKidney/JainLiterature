##  Introductory Note

I am delighted to present the second part of the **Karananuyog Deepak** to the readers. To understand the great texts of **Karananuyog**, namely **Dhavala**, **Jayathvala**, and **Mahadhayat**, it is essential to have knowledge of **Jiva-kanda** and **Karma-kanda**. Acharya Nemichandraji had compiled **Jiva-kanda** and **Karma-kanda** by selecting from the **Dhavala** and other texts. There was a time when these texts were studied and taught in schools with true understanding, but now it seems that students study only to obtain a certificate.

The first part of **Karananuyog Deepak** was written based on **Jiva-kanda**. Today, I am publishing the second part based on **Karma-kanda**. In this part, I have attempted to elucidate the key topics of **Karma-kanda** through 300 questions. The method initiated by Guru-na-Guru Shri Gopaladasji Baraiya, who wrote **Jain Siddhant Praveshika** in a question-answer format, making a difficult subject easy, proved to be very engaging. Other scholars have also attempted to write in the same style.

Organizing educational camps based on these publications can be highly beneficial. I had sent this book to Shri 105 Aryika Vishuddhamatiji, who reviewed it. Our fellow scholar, Pandit Jawaharlalji Shastri Bhindar, also added some annotations to clarify the subject. I have great respect for all of them.

I am addicted to serving the **Jinvani**. As a result, I do some work...

**Bhavana**

From time immemorial, every being in the world is bound by the strong chains of karma. Why, how, by whom, how much, and what kind of relationship does this karma have with the conscious soul? The living being has not yet contemplated or strived to understand all this and find ways to liberate itself from it. The compassionate Acharya Nemichandra, to impart understanding of all these questions with ease, revealed the Karmakanda text from the Shatkhandagama. To remove the complexities of Prakrit and Sanskrit languages, the great scholar Pandit Todarmalji translated this text into the Dhoondhari language. To further clarify the subject, the learned Aryika 105 Shri Adimataji took up her pen, which was edited by the expert in Karananuyoga, the late Pandit Ratanchandji Mukhtar of Saharanpur.

The wise scholar Pandit Pannalalji Sahityacharya, for the sake of easy understanding of the above questions, has presented the essence of the text before society through 300 questions and answers, performing a commendable task. It is hoped that the self-benefiting Bhavyas will make good use of this unparalleled work and make sincere efforts to liberate themselves from karma. This is my auspicious wish.

## Karmanuyoga Deepak, Part Two, First Chapter, Mangalacharan

**1.  **Saluting the present Jina, the leader of the western Tirthankaras, whose blazing fire of pure knowledge burns away all karmas. **2.**  Inspired by the welfare of the young, I describe, as per the scriptures, something about the karmas of those whose minds are afflicted.

**1. Question:** What is karma? 
**Answer:** Karma refers to those pudgala atoms, which, having been transformed by the passions of the soul (raga, etc.), become karma.

Page #7:
---------------------------
2. Question: What is Karma Vargana? Answer: Karma Vargana is the category of Pudgala Dravya which has the ability to produce Karma-rupa parinaama. These Karma Vargana paramanu are present in all lokas and are attached to every pradesha of the jiva. When the jiva has raaga, dvesha, etc. vikari bhaava, then the Karma Vargana paramanu become Karma-rupa and they develop the power of sthiti and phala. This is called bandha. 3. Question: Since when has Karma-bandha been going on? Answer: Just as the relationship between the kit-kalima and the suvarna-kanas residing in the mine is from anaadikaala, similarly the relationship between the jiva and karma is from anaadikaala. In Raja-vartika it is also said that on every pradesha of every aatma there are ananta-ananta pradesha of jnaana-aavaran, etc. karma. Then on each karma-pradesha there are ananta-ananta pradesha (paramanu) of audarika, etc. sharir. Then on each sharir-sambandhi pradesha there are ananta-ananta vinasopachya, which are situated like the accumulation of sand, etc. on wet jaggery. (Ra.Va. 5/8/16/451)

---------------------------
4. Question: If karma is not visible, how can its existence be known? Answer: Karma is a form of pudgala dravya and has form, taste, smell and touch, but because of its subtle transformation, it is not visible. However, the existence of karma can be inferred by observing the different conditions of beings, such as their knowledge and ignorance, poverty and wealth, strength and weakness. Question: Why do beings have emotions like attachment, etc., and since when? Answer: There is a natural power in both the jiva and pudgala dravya; due to that power, the jiva has the ability to transform into emotions like attachment, etc., and the pudgala dravya has the ability to transform into karma. Due to this ability, when the opportunity for karma arises, emotions like attachment, etc., arise in the jiva, and the pudgala dravya transforms into karma. This transformation of the jiva into emotions like attachment, etc., has been going on since time immemorial, and the transformation of the pudgala dravya into karma has also been going on since time immemorial. The material cause of the jiva's emotions like attachment, etc., is...

Page #9:
---------------------------
Because the soul is itself and the material substance is itself the material cause of the karmic transformation of the material substance. The immediate cause of the soul's passions, etc. is the arising state of the karma of conduct and delusion, and the immediate cause of karma is the soul's passions, etc. Even though there is a mutual cause-and-effect relationship between the soul and karma, one substance does not transform into the other, i.e., the soul always remains a soul and the material substance always remains material substance, but because of their synthetic union, they are not separate in the worldly state. Question: Even though the relationship between the soul and karma is from beginningless time, does it ever cease or not? Answer: The relationship between the soul and karma is of three types: beginningless-infinite, beginningless-finite, and finite-finite. The karma-relationship of the non-liberated and the distant-liberated is beginningless-infinite in comparison to the ordinary, i.e., it is from beginningless time and lasts for an infinite time. The karma-relationship of the liberated soul, even though it is beginningless in comparison to the ordinary, ceases due to austerity, by which it attains liberation. Therefore, it is beginningless...

---------------------------
Saant is and both Bhavy Abhavy in comparison to special, there is always a karma bandh and according to its state, the karma keeps getting destroyed, therefore it is Sadi-Saant. 7. Question: What is Upaadan Karan? Answer: The one which transforms into a work is called Upaadan Karan. For example, flour is the Upaadan Karan of roti because it transforms into roti. Question: What is Nimitt Karan? Answer: The one which helps the Upaadan to transform into a work is called Nimitt Karan. For example, fire, water, chakla, belan and the person who makes it, are the Nimitt Karan in the transformation of flour into roti. 6. Question: How many types of Nimitt Karan are there? Answer: There are two types of Nimitt Karan - 1. Antaranga Nimitt and 2. Bahiranga Nimitt. 10. Question: What is Antaranga Nimitt? Answer: The one due to which the transformation of Upaadan into work happens according to the rule is called Antaranga Nimitt, for example, Bhavy Jeev's...

---------------------------
Mithyatva, Samyak Mithyatva, Samyaktva Prakriti and the subsidence, destruction or subsidence of the infinite Anantaanubandhi Krodha-Mana-Maya-Lobha, are revealed by the Samyagdarshan rule.
11.
Question: What is called Bahirang Nimitta?
Answer: That which is cooperative with Antarang Nimitta is called Bahirang Nimitta, such as the teachings of Sadgurus, the vision of the Jinenndra Bimba, etc., in the origin of Samyagdarshan. It is not a rule that the work will be accomplished by the meeting of Bahirang Nimitta, but the work is accomplished by the rule of the meeting of Antarang Nimitta. When Antarang Nimitta is met, Bahirang Nimitta can be anything.
12.
Question: Is it necessary to have Bahirang Nimitta to get Antarang Nimitta?
Answer: It is necessary to make an effort to get Bahirang Nimitta to get Antarang Nimitta. For example, it is necessary to get married to get a son, but it is not a rule that a son will be born after getting married. It is certain that the meeting of Bahirang Nimitta like marriage is necessary for the birth of a son when the suitability of Antarang Nimitta is met.

---------------------------
13. Question: What is a **Samarth Karan**?
- Answer: The compatibility of **Upaadan** and **Nimitt** is called **Samarth Karan**. The accomplishment of a task is not only due to the **Upaadan Karan** or only due to the **Nimitt Karan**. It happens due to the **Samarth Karan** which is the compatibility of both. One substance cannot be the **Upaadan Karan** of another substance, but it can be the **Nimitt Karan**.
14. Question: What is a **Bhavya**?
- Answer: A being who has the ability to attain **Samyag Darshan**, **Samyag Gyan**, and **Samyacharitra** is called a **Bhavya**. Only a **Bhavya** being is eligible for **Moksha**, but after attaining **Moksha**, the **Bhavya** state does not remain.
15. Question: Can all **Bhavya** beings attain **Moksha**?
- Answer: No, not all **Bhavya** beings attain **Moksha**. They are called **Bhavya** due to their potential, but they never get the opportunity to develop their potential.

Page #13:
---------------------------
16. Question: What is an Abhvy?
Answer: One who does not have the capacity to attain Samyagdarshan, etc. is called an Abhvy. Just as unripe mung beans, even when exposed to fire and water, do not ripen, similarly, Abhvy beings, even when the necessary conditions are present, cannot attain the Ratna Tray.

17.
Question: How many types of Karma are there?
Answer: In essence, Karma is of two types: Dravyakarma and Bhavakarma. The mass of Pudgala Dravya that is transformed into Karma is called Dravyakarma, and its power is called Bhavakarma. The transformation that occurs in the Jiva due to the arising of Dravyakarma, which is in the form of Raga and Dvesha, is also called Bhavakarma. Dravyakarma is further divided into two types: Ghati and Aghati.

18.

Page #14:

And 4. Antaray. These karmas, in order, destroy the qualities of knowledge, perception, happiness and vigor in the jiva. 16. 'Question: What are the Anujeevi qualities? Answer: Those qualities that keep the jiva's jivatva (state of being a jiva) secure are called Anujeevi qualities, such as knowledge, perception, happiness and vigor. Just as the presence of heat keeps the fire's agnitva (state of being fire) secure, similarly, the presence of knowledge, perception, etc. qualities keeps the jiva's jivatva secure. 20. Question: What are Aghati karmas and how many types are there? Answer: Those karmas that do not destroy the Anujeevi qualities of the jiva are called Aghati karmas. There are four types of these: 1. Vedaniya 2. Aayu 3. Naam and 4. Gotra. These karmas, in order, destroy the qualities of Avyaabadhatva, Avgahanatva, Sukshmatva and Agurulaghutva in the jiva. These qualities are called the Pratijeevi qualities of the jiva. 21. Question: What is the Jnanavarana karma?

Manaḥparyaya jñāna and 5. Kevalajñāna. The one who

Page #17:

**Darshan** is the term used for knowledge that is obtained without any choice. There are four types of Darshan: 1. **Chakshudarshan**, 2. **Achakshudarshan**, 3. **Avadhi Darshan**, and 4. **Keval Darshan**.

The knowledge of beings up to the 12th **Gunasthan** is obtained through **Darshan**, meaning that **Darshan** occurs first, followed by knowledge. However, **Kevalgyan** and **Keval Darshan** occur simultaneously. 

**Shrutagnyan** and **Matigyan** are obtained through **Darshan**. Similarly, **Manahparyaya Gyan** and **Iha Matigyan** are obtained through **Darshan**. Therefore, **Shrutadarshan** and **Manahparyaya Darshan** do not occur before these types of knowledge.

**Veerasen Swami** has defined the term **Samanya** as **Atma** (soul). Therefore, according to him, **Samanyavlokan** means **Atmavalokan** (observing the soul).

115. Question: What is **anadeya karma**?

1.  **Asthira karma** causes the transformation of rasa (nutrient fluid) into other dhatus (tissues). (Yal 13/361) This means rasa transforms into rakta (blood), rakta into mamsa (flesh), mamsa into meda (fat), meda into asthi (bone), asthi into majja (marrow), and majja into virya (semen). The karma that causes this transformation is called **asthira karma**. If **asthira karma** is not present, rasa will remain as rasa, and it will not transform into other dhatus. (Dhaval 6/63.64)

Rajavarteka (8/11, Pa. 34) states that the karma that causes the body and its limbs to remain stable even after performing difficult fasts, etc., and not become thin, is **sthira karma**. The karma that causes the body to become thin due to a single fast or exposure to ordinary cold or heat is **asthira karma**. 70 Va. 8/29/34-35, p. 176 and 755!! (33)

Answer: The **Tirthankara Karma** is that which, upon its rise, causes the being to attain the position of a **Tirthankara**. This is a **Sati-shaya** (exceedingly auspicious) **Punyakarma** (karmic action of merit). Upon its rise, the eight **Pratiharayas** (miracles) are obtained in the **Samavasarana** (assembly hall of a Tirthankara). 116. Question: What is **Gotra Karma**? Answer: The **Gotra Karma** is that which, upon its rise, causes the destruction of the **Aguruladhu** (subtle) qualities of the being, or causes the being to be born in a high or low family. It has two divisions: 1. **Uchcha Gotra** (high family) and 2. **Nīcha Gotra** (low family). Upon the rise of **Uchcha Gotra**, the being is born in a high family, renowned in the world.

Page #40:
---------------------------
Birth occurs in a family and from the rise of a low gotra, the world is considered low. Birth occurs in a low gotra of naraki and tiryanch. The rise of a high gotra remains for dev and bhogabhumij humans, but karmabhumij humans are born in both types of gotras. 120. Question: What is antarayakarma? Answer: The karma that destroys the viryatva guna of a jiva or whose rise causes obstacles in dan, lam, bhog, upbhog and virya is called antarayakarma. It has five types: 1. Danantaraya, 2. Labhantaraya, 3. Bhogantaray, 4. Upbhogantaray and 5. Viryantaray. The meaning of all is clear from the name. 121. Question: How many karma pradeshas are bound at one time? Answer: At one time, the binding of time-bound karma occurs from the infinite part of the siddhas and the infinite multiplied pradeshas from the abhavya rashi. 
1. However, the revered Bhagavad Virasen Swami has said that - tirikhkesu sanjamasanjam padivalayantesu uchagoudattubalam badho (Dhaval 15/142, 173-74 etc.) meaning that a high gotra is found in tiryanch who follow sanjamasanjam. Thus, there are two opinions on this subject.

Asthir, Ashubh, Durbhrag, Duhswar, Anadeya, Ayashaskirti. These 100 are the natures of sins. In these, there is no bondage of Samyag Mithyatva and Samyaktva nature, only the bondage of Mithyatva nature occurs! Due to the influence of Samyaktva, when the three parts of Mithyatva are broken, their existence occurs and their rise also occurs in due time, therefore, there are 68 in terms of bondage and 100 in terms of existence and rise. The twenty natures of Varna etc. are in both the forms of punya and papa, therefore, they are included in both.
133. Question: Is the bondage of Ayukarma less?
Answer: The bondage of Ayukarma occurs in the first time of the third part after two parts of the present age of the Karmabhoomij man and Tiryanch are gone. If the bondage does not occur at that time due to the absence of the share of Leshya suitable for the bondage of age, then it occurs at the beginning of the third part after two parts of the remaining third part are gone. In this way, eight Apakarshkalas come. If there is no bondage in these, then when in the present age 
(41)

Page #47:
---------------------------
When the remaining time is "Asankṣepāddhā" (half of the lifespan), according to the rules, the bondage of the lifespan related to the next birth occurs. When six months remain in the current lifespan of Devas and Narakas.
The time of "Āya Apakṣarṣa" (decline of lifespan) arrives, and when nine months remain in the current lifespan of Bhoga Bhūmij humans and Tiryanchas, eight
"Apakṣarṣa" times arrive. 134. Question: Until which "Guṇasthāna" (stage of spiritual progress) does the bondage of which lifespan occur?
Answer: The bondage of Naraka lifespan occurs until the first "Guṇasthāna", the bondage of Tiryancha lifespan occurs until the second "Guṇasthāna", the bondage of human lifespan occurs until the second "Guṇasthāna" in comparison to Karma Bhūmij humans and Tiryanchas, and until the fourth "Guṇasthāna" in comparison to Devas and Narakas. The bondage of any lifespan does not occur in the third "Guṇasthāna". The fourth and fifth "Guṇasthāna" of Tiryanchas, and...
1. It is important to note that the "Asankṣepāddhā" time is a fraction of the "Āvali" (cycle of time), not a fraction of the "Asankhyāta" (innumerable). (Gok. Page 126, Āryikā Ādimati Ji's commentary, edited by A. Ratanchand Mukhtar and Dhaval 11/266, 273, 275 and P. 11 162, last line, etc. should be seen)

---------------------------
From the fourth to the seventh *guna sthana* of a human being, only *deva-ayu* is bound. In the *asta-maadi* *guna sthana*, *ayukarma* is not bound. The *saakshi* does not have any *ayu* bound. According to the rules of *bhog-bhoomija* and *ku-bhog-bhoomija* humans and *tiryanch*, *deva-ayu* is bound. In the seventh hell, the *naarki* has only *tiryanch-ayu* bound. The *naarki* of the remaining hells and the *deva* up to the twelfth heaven are eligible to have *manushya-ayu* and *tiryanch-ayu* bound. From the thirteenth heaven to *sarvarth-siddhi*, the *deva* are bound by *manushya-ayu* according to the rules. *Tejas-kayika* and *vayu-kayika* beings are bound by *tiryanch-ayu* according to the rules. A being who has come out of hell is neither *eka-indriya* nor *vikal-tray*; but a *deva* up to the second heaven can be born in the remaining *eka-indriya* except *tejas-kayika* and *vayu-kayika*. However,

1. In the seventh *guna sthana*, there is only *bandha-nishtpan*. And in those *sthana* which are not on the verge of becoming a *shreni*, *yudhiti* occurs only at the end of the time of the *aprammat*. On the other hand, *saatishay-aprammat* does not become a *shreni*, therefore, *vyuniti* does not occur.

When a significant portion (or a specific portion) of the time of the *aprammat-sanyat* has passed, the binding of *deva-ayu* is severed. (Dhaval 8/302, 30, 353. 371 etc.) In other words, if the *aprammat* is *ghar-samaya-yati*, then it remains *abandha* (unbound).

---------------------------
Not in the three Vikal. 135. Question: How many karmas of a being are bound together? Answer: The binding of Ayus karma does not happen at every moment, but in divisions. Therefore, the binding of the remaining seven karmas happens at every moment. And at the time of Tribhaga, the binding of Ayus happens, so the binding of eight karmas happens. The binding of Moh karma happens only up to the ninth Gunasthan, therefore in the tenth Gunasthan, the binding of the remaining six karmas happens, excluding Moh and Ayus. And in the 11th, 12th, and 13th Gunasthan, only the binding of one Saatavedaniya happens. In this way, the binding of 8, 7, 6, and 1 karma happens. 136. Question: What is the arrangement of the binding of Sapratipaksha Prakritis in Uttar Prakritis? Answer: In Uttar Prakritis, the binding of mutually opposing Prakritis does not happen together. For example, when Saatavedaniya is being bound, Asaatavedaniya will not be bound. And when the binding of Neecha Gotra is happening, the binding of Uccha Gotra will not happen. When the binding of the opposing Prakriti is extinguished, then further... (44)

Page #50:
---------------------------
It is only the residual nature that is continuously bound. For example, the Saata Vedaniya and Asaata Vedaniya are two opposing natures. The binding of Asaata Vedaniya is extinguished in the sixth Gunasthan, therefore, until the sixth Gunasthan, the binding of one of the two will occur, and from the seventh Gunasthan to the thirteenth Gunasthan, the binding of Saata Vedaniya will occur at all times.
137. Question: When and to whom does the binding of the Tirthankara nature occur?
Answer: The binding of the Tirthankara nature occurs in the fourth to eighth Gunasthan, in the sixth part of the constitution of a Kavalika or Shruta Kevali human in the Karmabhoomi. The binding of the Tirthankara nature can occur in all four Samyagdarshanas: Prathamopa Sham, Dvitiyopa Sham, Kshayopa Shamik, and Kshayik. A human who has bound himself to the Tiryanch or Manushyaayu before attaining Samyagdarshan will not have the binding of the Tirthankara nature even after attaining Samyagdrishti. However, a person who has bound himself to Naraka or Devaayu before attaining Samyagdarshan may have the binding of the Tirthankara nature, or a person who has bound himself to any (સપૂર્વ

Page #51:
---------------------------
Even if one has not bound the lifespan, they can bind the Tirthankara nature. If a human being binds the Tirthankara nature, they will attain liberation or the third existence. Their second existence will be spent in hell or in the celestial realm. If a human being with right faith who binds the Tirthankara nature goes to hell, they will only go to the first hell. Although one can become a Tirthankara even after escaping the second and third hells, the humans born there become wrong faith at the time of death, and as long as they remain wrong faith, the inflow of the Tirthankara nature's realms remains closed. It resumes upon attaining right faith. The Tirthankara nature is such that once it begins, its inflow continues uninterrupted.

138. Question: Where does the binding of the food-consuming body and the limbs and organs of the food-consuming body occur?
Answer: The binding of the food-consuming body and the limbs and organs of the food-consuming body occurs from the seventh guna-sthana to the sixth part of the eighth guna-sthana, and their emergence occurs in the sixth guna-sthana.

136. Question: Where in heaven and hell is a living being born with which cohesion?
Answer: A living being with Asamprapta Pattika cohesion is born up to the eighth heaven, with Keelak cohesion up to the twelfth heaven, with Ardha Narach cohesion up to the sixteenth heaven, with Narach, Vajra Narach, and Vajra-Rshabha Narach cohesion up to the Navgraiveyak, with Vajra Narach and Vajra-Rshabha Narach cohesion up to the Nav Anudish Vimanas, and with Vajra-Rshabha cohesion up to the Anuttar Vimanas.
A sentient being with six cohesions, if it goes to hell, goes up to the third hell, a being with five cohesions, excluding Sripatika, goes up to the fifth hell, a being with Ardha Narach cohesion goes up to the sixth hell, and a being with Vajra-Rshabha cohesion goes up to the seventh hell.

## Bandha (Bondage)

**140. Question:** What is Bandha? 
**Answer:** When a Jiva (soul) with Kashayas (passions) acquires Karma-rupa (karmic matter) particles, it is called Bandha. This bond between the Jiva and Karma is like the inseparable union of water and milk, a synthetic combination.

**141. Question:** How many types of Bandha are there?
**Answer:** There are four types: 1. Prakriti Bandha, 2. Sthiti Bandha, 3. Anubhag Bandha, and 4. Pradesh Bandha.

**142. Question:** What is Prakriti Bandha?
**Answer:** The inherent nature of Karma particles, such as obscuring knowledge, is called Prakriti Bandha.

**143. Question:** What is Sthiti Bandha?
**Answer:** The duration of time for which Karma particles bear fruit in the Karma Pradesh (karmic field) is called Sthiti Bandha.

**144. Question:** What is Anubhag Bandha?
**Answer:** The intensity of the fruit-bearing capacity of Karma particles in the Karma Pradesh is called Anubhag Bandha.

Page #54:
---------------------------
It is called **Anubhag Bandha**. 145. Question: What is **Pradesh Bandha**? Answer: The **parinaman** (transformation) that occurs due to the **hina-adhikta** (lesser-greater) in the number of **pradeshas** (regions) of **karma** (actions) like **Jnana-avaran** (knowledge-obscuring karma) is called **Pradesh Bandha**. 146. Question: What are the causes of **Chaturvidha Bandha** (fourfold bondage)? Answer: **Prakriti Bandha** (nature bondage) and **Pradesh Bandha** occur due to **yoga** (union), and **Sthiti Bandha** (state bondage) and **Anubhag Bandha** occur due to **kashaya** (passions). 147. Question: How many **ayantar** (sub-divisions) are there of **Prakriti Bandha** etc.? Answer: There are four: **utkrusht** (excellent), **anutkrusht** (inferior), **ajghannya** (not the worst), and **jghannya** (worst); the most is called **utkrusht**, the less than that is called **anutkrusht**, the least is called **jghannya**, and slightly more than **jghannya** is called **ajghannya**. The divisions from **anutkrusht** to **ajghannya** are called **madhyama** (medium). 1. Alternatively, the nature of **anutkrusht** and **ajghannya** can also be seen like this. In the **ajghannya** category, all options beyond **jghannya** are seen. (That is, all divisions different from **jghannya** are **ajghannya** in nature). Similarly, in all options with the designation **anutkrusht** below **utkrusht**, the **jghannya** category is also seen. (Dhaval Pu. 12 p. 5, 6) (That is, all divisions different from **utkrusht** are **anutkrusht** in nature). (46)

Page #55:
---------------------------
148. Question: How many sub-categories are there of **utkrusht bandh** (superior bondage) etc.? Answer: There are four: **saadi**, **anaadi**, **dhruv**, and **adhruv**. The bondage that stops and then resumes is called **saadi bandh**. The bondage that continues from **anaadi** (beginningless) until **vyuchchitti** (liberation) is called **anaadi bandh**. The bondage that is continuous is called **dhruv bandh**, and the bondage that has intervals is called **adhruv bandh**. The **abhavya** (non-liberated) being has **dhruv bandh**, and the **bhavya** (liberated) being has **adhruv bandh**. 146. Question: How do the **saadi-anaadi-dhruv-adhruv** categories occur in the **mool prakritis** (fundamental substances)? Answer: Except for **vedaniya** (sensory) and **ayu** (life-span) karma, the remaining six karmas have all four types of bondage: **saadi**, **anaadi**, **dhruv**, and **adhruv**. **Vedaniya karma** has three types of bondage except for **saadi**, and **ayu karma** has only **saadi** and **adhruv** bondage. 
1. **Vedaniya** does not have **saadi bandh** because even when ascending the **upsham** (subduing) category, there is no absence of bondage of **vedaniya** in general. (Go. Ka. p. 100, 612, Tika Pu. A. Adimatiji; Samp. Ratanchand Ji Mukhtar).

---------------------------
150. Question: What are the Dhruva-bandhi (fixed-binding) natures and how many and which are they? Answer: Those whose binding continues until the destruction of the bond are called Dhruva-bandhi natures. They are 47, such as the 16 natures of the three Ghatiya Karmas (5+6+5=16) without Mohaniya, the 16 Kashayas like Mithyatva, Anantanabandhi Chatushk, etc., the 4 of Varna, etc. from Bhaya, Jugupsa, Taijasa, Karman, Agurulaghu, Upghāt, Nirman, and Abhed Vivaksha. Their binding continues until their respective Gunasthan of binding and destruction. Except for these, the remaining 73 natures are Adhruva-bandhi (non-fixed-binding). They have only two types of binding: Sadi (with) and Adhruva (without). 151. Question: Which are the Sapratipaksha (with opposing) and Apratipaksha (without opposing) natures among the Adhruva-bandhi natures? Answer: The Tirthankara Aharaka pair, Parghāt, Ucchvās, Ātap, Udyot, and the four Āyas, these 11 natures are Apratipaksha - without opposing, meaning that when their binding occurs, it occurs, and if it does not occur, it does not occur. The remaining 62 natures are Sapratipaksha - with opposing, such as the 51 Sata-vedaniya.

And Asatavedaniya, etc. When one is bound, the other is not. The Tirthankara, Aharaka couple and the four Asas, these seven natures are bound and unbound in an instant, and the rest in one time. || 152. Question: How many natures are eligible for bondage, arising and being? Answer: The Acharyas have described bondage and arising with the intention of non-differentiation, and being with the intention of differentiation. In the intention of non-differentiation, there are five bondages, five aggregates, and sixteen of Varna, etc., and the Samyagmithyatva and Samyaktava-nature, thus twenty-eight natures are less, making 120 natures eligible for bondage. The arising of Samyagmithyatva and Samyaktava-nature occurs. Therefore, there are 122 natures eligible for arising. The arising of Samyagmithyatva occurs in the third Gunasthan, and the arising of Samyaktava-nature occurs from the fourth to the seventh Gunasthan. Being is of 5+6+2+28+4+63+2+5=148 natures.
153. Question: What is called Bandha Tribhangi? Answer: Bandha Vyuchchichchhati, Bandha and Abandha are called Bandha Tribhangi. The description of these three in the Gunasthanas and Marganas

Bonding occurs from the fourth to the eighth *gunasthanas*, and the bonding of the *aaharaka* pair occurs in the seventh and eighth *gunasthanas*. Therefore, since the three *prakritis* are unbondable in the first *gunasthanas*, they have been reduced. As a result, in the first *gunasthanas*, the bond *vyuchchitti* is 16, the bond is 117, and the non-bond is 3. Due to the reduction of 16 *vyuchchhinna* *prakritis* in the first *gunasthanas*, 101 *prakritis* remain bondable in the second *gunasthanas*. Therefore, the bond *vyuchchitti* is 25, the bond is 101, and the non-bond is 16+3-16. Due to the reduction of 25 *vyuchchhinna* *prakritis* in the second *gunasthanas*, 76 remain. However, in the third *gunasthanas*, there is no bond of *ayu*. Therefore, 2 more *prakritis* are reduced. In this way, in the third *gunasthanas*, the bond *vyuchchitti* is zero, the bond is 74, and the non-bond is 16+25+2=46. In the fourth *gunasthanas*, the bond of *manushyayu*, *devayu*, and *tirthankara* *prakritis* begins. Therefore, the bond is 74+3=77. The bond *vyuchchitti* is 10, the bond is 77, and the non-bond is 46-3=43. Due to the reduction of 10 *vyuchchhinna* *prakritis* in the fourth *gunasthanas*, in the fifth *gunasthanas*, the bond is 67, the bond *vyuchchitti* is 4, and the non-bond is 43+10=53. Due to the reduction of 4 *vyuchchhinna* *prakritis* from the fifth *gunasthanas*, in the sixth...

In the Gunasthana, there are 63 Bandha, 6 Bandha Vyuchchitti, and 53+4=57 Abandha. By reducing the 6 Vyuchchinn Prakritis of the 6th Gunasthana and combining the Aharak Yugal, in the 7th Gunasthana, there are 56 Bandha, 1 Bandha Vyuchchitti, and 57+6=63, 63 Abandha. By reducing the 1 Vyuchchinn Prakriti of the 7th Gunasthana, in the 8th Gunasthana, there are 58 Bandha, 36 Bandha Vyuchchitti, and 61+1=62 Abandha. By reducing the 36 Vyuchchinn Prakritis of the 8th Gunasthana, in the 9th Gunasthana, there are 22 Bandha, 5 Bandha Vyuchchitti, and 62+36=68 Abandha. By reducing the 5 Vyuchchinn Prakritis of the 9th Gunasthana, in the 10th Gunasthana, there are 17 Bandha, 16 Bandha Vyuchchitti, and 68+5=103 Abandha. By reducing the 16 Vyuchchinn Prakritis of the 10th Gunasthana, in the 11th, 12th, and 13th Gunasthana, there is 1 Bandha and 116 Abandha. In the 11th and 12th Gunasthana, Bandha Vyuchchitti is zero. By reducing the 1 Bandha Vyuchchitti of the 13th Gunasthana, in the 14th Gunasthana, Bandha and Bandha Vyuchchitti are zero, and there are 120 Abandha Prakritis. By subtracting the Vyuchchitti from the Bandha Prakritis of the previous Gunasthana, the Bandha of the next Gunasthana is obtained.

It emerges and by combining the detachment of the present quality-state and the bondage of the present quality-state, the bondage of the upcoming quality-state emerges. The plan of combining and subtracting other natures should be done according to the instructions. 168. Question: How much is the state-bondage of the original natures like knowledge-obscuration etc.? Answer: The excellent state-bondage of knowledge-obscuration, vision-obscuration, obstruction and vedaniya karma is thirty koḍa koḍī sagar, name and gotra is twenty koḍa koḍī sagar, delusion is seventy koḍa koḍī sagar, lifespan karma is thirty-three sagar. Special-vision-delusion-falsehood is seventy koḍa koḍī sagar and character-delusion is forty koḍa koḍī sagar. Unsufferable is thirty koḍa koḍī sagar and sufferable is fifteen koḍa koḍī sagar. 166. Question: What is the least state-bondage of the original natures? Answer: The least state-bondage of vedaniya is twelve muhūrta, name and gotra is eight muhūrta and the rest karma is antarmuhūrta. The least state-bondage of natures happens at the time of detachment. That is, where the bondage of which nature detaches... (60)

There it is. The **jighnya** **sthitibandha** of the **vishesh-tirthankara** nature and the **aaharaka** couple is **kora kori** **sagar**. The **jighnya** **sthitibandha** of **manushyayu** and **tiryagayu** is **antarmuhurt** and that of **devayu** and **narakayu** is ten thousand years. . 170. Question: What is the cause of **utkrusht** **sthitibandha**? Answer: The **utkrusht** **sthitibandha** of the other 117 natures without the three **shubh** **ayu** is due to the **utkrusht** **samklesh** **parinam** as much as possible and the **jighnya** **sthitibandha** is the opposite of this, i.e., due to **mandakshaya** **rupa** **parinam**. The **utkrusht** **sthitibandha** of the three **shubhayuk** is due to **vishuddha** **parinam** and the **jighnya** **sthitibandha** is due to **samklesh** **parinam**. In particular, the **utkrusht** **sthitibandha** of **devayu** is done by the one who is in the **pramatt** **gunasthan** facing the ascent to the seventh **gunasthan**. The **utkrusht** **sthitibandha** of the **aaharaka** couple is done by the one who is in the seventh **gunasthan** facing the descent to the sixth **gunasthan** and the **utkrusht** **sthitibandha** of the **tirthankara** nature is done by the **avirat** **samyagdristi** who is in the fourth **gunasthan** facing hell. Except for these four natures of **tirthankara**, **aaharaka**, and **devayu**, the **utkrusht** **sthitibandha** of the other 116 natures is done by the **mithyadristi** **jiva**.

171. Question: What is Ābādhā? Answer: The time period from when a substance comes into existence in the form of karma until it becomes manifest or activated is called Ābādhā.

172. Question: What is the Ābādhā of each karma? Answer: The consideration of Āraksha is of two types, based on the distinction between Aga and Umarga. With respect to Udaya, except for Āyukarma, the Ābādhā of the remaining seven karmas is one Koḍa Koḍī Sāgara for a hundred years. The Ābādhā of all other situations should be understood in the same proportion. For example, the Ābādhā of a karma whose highest state is bound to seventy Koḍa Koḍī Sāgara will be seven thousand years, meaning that those karma atoms will not manifest for that duration. Specifically, the Ābādhā of karmas whose state is bound to Anta Koḍa Koḍī Pramaṇ is Antarmūhūrta. The Ābādhā of Āyukarma ranges from one-third of a crore Pūrva to Asankṣepād Dhā Kāla. With respect to Udeeraṇā, the Ābādhā of all karmas is one Āvali Pramaṇ, meaning that the bound karma nature can be activated after one Achalāvali. (62)

Page #68:
---------------------------
It should be kept in mind that the **āyुकर्म** (life-span karma) does not stimulate the **परभव** (previous life), only the **वर्तमान यु** (present life). 173. Question: How do **बद्ध कर्म** (bound karmas) arise? Answer: From the total duration of a karma, subtract the **आबाधाकाल** (period of obstruction). The remaining time is the period in which the karma atoms, according to the **निषेक रचना** (process of maturation), bear fruit and are gradually **निजीणे** (destroyed) - **खिरते** (disappear). After the **आबाधा** (obstruction) is over, in the first **निषेक** (maturation), many karma atoms **खिरते** (disappear), and in subsequent **निषेक** (maturations), they disappear in decreasing numbers. This process continues until the end of the duration of the bound karma. This is the process of **सविपाक निर्जरा** (destruction of karmas with fruition). If, due to **तपश्चरणादि** (austerities, etc.), the opportunity for **अविपाक निर्जरा** (destruction of karmas without fruition) arises, then many karma atoms disappear at once. 574. Question: How does the power of **अनुभाग** (fractional fruition) arise in karmas? Answer: The **अनुभाग बन्ध** (binding of fractional fruition) is in accordance with the **हीनधिकता कषाय** (degree of passion). In **शुभ कर्म** (auspicious karmas), there is more **अनुभाग** (fractional fruition) due to **विशुद्ध परिणाम** (pure result) and **मन्दकषाय रूप परिणाम** (result with mild passion), and less in **अशुभ कर्म** (inauspicious karmas). (63)

Page #69:
---------------------------
And due to the results in the form of afflictions, there is less experience of auspicious karmas and more experience of inauspicious karmas. 175. Question: How is the experience of Dhātia karmas?
Answer: The Ācāryas have explained the experience of Dhātia karmas through the example of a creeper (latā), wood (dāru), bone (asthi) and stone (śaila), i.e., just as the hardness increases in a creeper, wood, bone and stone, in the same way the power of experiencing the results of karma-natures increases in hardness. In the above examples, the experiences up to the infinite part of the creeper and wood are Deshaghati-rupa, and the remaining majority part of the wood, and the experiences related to bone and stone are Sarvaghati-rupa.
176. Question: How is the experience of Adhātia karmas?
Answer: In Adhātia karmas, the auspicious natures like Sātavedaniya etc. have an experience like jaggery, sugar candy, sugar and nectar, and the inauspicious natures like Asātavedaniya etc.

Page #70:
---------------------------
They are like Neem, Kanjira, poison and Halahala. This means that there are countless Lok Praman Avantaar Bhed of punya and paap. According to the Anubhag, the Jeeva experiences happiness and sorrow in proportion to its merit. For example, even though a Devagati and a Devayu are of the same punya prakriti, a Dev of an ineligible jati has to become a vehicle, which makes him experience sanklesh, while the one who sits on him experiences happiness.

**Question 177:** What is the nature and quantity of Samay Prabaddh in Pradesh Bandh?

**Answer:** The Pind of Karman Vargana, which is bound at one time, consisting of five rasas, five varn, two gandhas and four sparshas (Sheeta-Ushna, Snigdha Rooksha), is equal to the Anantavaan Bhaag of Siddhas multiplied by Anantaguna of Abhavya Rashi. This is called Samay Prabaddh.

**Question 178:** Who divides Samay Prabaddh into Jnana Avaranaadi Karmas and in what proportion?

**1-** This number is so large that even after being multiplied by Ananta by Abhavya, it is still equal to the Ananta Bhaag of Siddhas.

Answer: At the time of attaining the state of bondage, the transformation of knowledge-obscuration, etc. happens on its own. Among the Aatmas, the Vedaniya receives the most province, the Mohaniya receives less, the Jnanaavaran-Darshanavaran and Antaraya receive less but are equal to each other, the Naam and Gotra receive less but are equal to each other, and the Aayu Karma receives the least province. . 576. Question: What is the main cause of Pradesh? And how many types are there? Answer: Pradesh is the main cause of bondage, which are the alternatives of Yogasthan-Atma Pradesh. There are three types of it - 1 Uppaad Yogasthan, 2 Ekantaanuvrudhi Yogasthan and 3 Parinaam Yogasthan. At the first time of the new Paryaya, the living being has Uppaad Yogasthan. From the second time of holding the Paryaya till the completion of the body's sufficiency, it receives a regular increase and becomes Ekantaanuvrudhi Yogasthan, and from the time of completion of the body's sufficiency till the end of life, it becomes Parinaam Yogasthan. In this, the Atma Pradesh's Parispand keeps decreasing and increasing. Its other name is Ghotmaan Yogasthan.

80. Question: What is the material of the utkriṣṭa (excellent) and jaghanya (inferior) pradeśa bandha?
Answer: The living being who engages in vanya (destruction) of saṃjñā, paryāptaka, and alpaprākṛtis along with utkarṣa yogas (excellent yogas) performs the utkriṣṭa pradeśa bandha, and the living being opposite to this performs the jaghanya pradeśa bandha.

181. Question: In which gunasthāna (spiritual stage) does the utkriṣṭa pradeśa bandha of the mūla prakṛtis (fundamental karmas) occur?
Answer: The utkriṣṭa pradeśa bandha of āyuḥkarma (lifespan karma) is performed by the one residing in the seventh gunasthāna after the anantara (immediately preceding) six gunasthānas. The utkriṣṭa pradeśa bandha of mohanīya (deluding) karma is performed by the one in the ninth gunasthāna, and the utkriṣṭa pradeśa bandha of the remaining six karmas is performed by the one possessing utkriṣṭa yogas (excellent yogas) in the sūkṣma sāmparāya (subtle equanimity) gunasthāna.

182. Question: Whose is the jaghanya pradeśa bandha?
Answer: The sūkṣma nigodīya labdhyaparyāptaka (minutely subtle nigodīya with partial capacity) living being performs the jaghanya (inferior) yoga-induced pradeśa bandha of all karmas except āyuḥkarma (lifespan karma) in the first moment of its paryāya (state of existence).

The seven actions bind the gross region of the karma. Further, when the bondage of life occurs, the gross region of the karma of that very being is also bound.

Tak and Manushayau arise in all Gunasthanas from the beginning. The Jiva who arises in the Saladar Gunasthana does not arise in the Naraka Gati, therefore his Naraka Gati Anupurvi does not arise. The remaining Karma Prakruti arise in the Mithyatvadi Gunasthanas until the end of their respective Uday Vyuchchitti.
185. Question: What is Uday Tribhangi?
Answer: Uday Vyuchchitti, Uday and Anudaya are called Uday Tribhangi.
186. Question: How many Karma Prakruti Vyuchchitti occur in each Gunasthana?
Answer: From the perspective of Abhed Vivaksha, in the Mithyadristi etc. fourteen Gunasthanas, 10, 4, 1, 17, 8, 5, 4, 6, 6, 1, 2, (2, 14), 26 and 13 Prakruti Vyuchchitti occur respectively.

188. Question: What are the **vyakshadeva** (characteristics) on both sides?
Answer: According to some **acharyas**, there are no **sasadan gunasthana** (stages of purification) in **ekendriya** (one-sensed) and **vikalatraya** (three-fold affliction). Therefore, the **ekendriya**, **sthavar** (stationary), and **dwi-indriyadi** (two-sensed and above) three **jati** (species) have their **udaya** (arising) and **vyuchchitti** (cessation) in the first **gunasthana** (stage of purification). As a result, there are 10 **prakriti** (elements) in the first and 4 in the second. In the penultimate stage of the twelfth **gunasthana**, there are 2, and in the final stage, there are 14, making a total of 16 **vyuchchitti**. In the fourteenth **gunasthana**, due to being mutually contradictory, **sata** (true) and **asata** (false) **avedaniya** (non-cognizable) do not arise simultaneously. Therefore, 1 **vyuchchitti** is considered in the thirteenth and 1 in the fourteenth. However, considering different **jiva** (souls), both can arise simultaneously, making the options 26, 13 and 30, 12. Here, the **udaya** (arising) is described as **tribhangi** (three-fold) according to the **mata** (opinion) of **Bhutbali Acharya**.

186. Question: Which 5 **prakriti** (elements) are **vyuchchhinna** (ceased) in the **mithyadristi** (false belief) **gunasthana** (stage of purification)?
Answer: **Mithyatva** (falsehood), **atapas** (heat), **sukshma** (subtle), **aparayapta** (insufficient), and **sadharana** (ordinary), these five **prakriti** (elements) have their **udaya** (arising) and **vyuchchitti** (cessation) in the first **gunasthana** (stage of purification).

Page #81:
---------------------------
204. Question: In which Gunasthana (state of being) do how many Prakṛtis (principles) arise?
Answer: In Mithyadṛṣṭi (false belief) etc. Gunasthānas, 5, 11, 22, 18, 35, 41, 46, 50, 56, 62, 63, 65, 80 and 110 Prakṛtis arise respectively. 205. Question: How is the plan of Tribhanga (three-fold) in the Gunasthānas? Answer: In total, there are 122 Prakṛtis that are capable of arising. Out of these, in the first Gunasthāna, Samyamithyatva (complete false belief), Samyaktva (right belief) Prakṛti, Āhārak Śarīra (physical body), Āhārak Śarīrāṅgopāṅga (parts and sub-parts of the physical body) and Tīrthankara (liberated soul) these five Prakṛtis do not arise, so there are 117 that arise. The above 5 arise and there is a Vyucchitti (disappearance) of 5. Out of the 117 that arise in the first Gunasthāna, after subtracting the 5 of Vyucchitti and the Narakagatyānupūrvī (consecutive births in hell), the arising in the second Gunasthāna is 111. There is a Vyucchitti of 5 and an Anudaya (non-arising) of 5, so in these 10 Prakṛtis, there is a Narakagatyānupūrvī, so the Anudaya is 11 and the Vyucchitti is 6. Out of the 111 Prakṛtis that are capable of arising in Sāsadan (the state of being a human), after subtracting the 6 Prakṛtis of Vyucchitti, 102 remain, but in the third Gunasthāna... (76)

Page #82:
---------------------------
Since there is no death, no *anupurvi* arises. The *narak gatyanupurvi* has already decreased, so after subtracting 3 *anupurvis*, 66 remain. When *samyagmithyatva* nature is added to these, the *udaya* in the third *gunasthan* is 100. Adding the 11 *anudaya* from the previous *anudaya* and the 6 *udaya vyuchchitti* natures, we get 20. Adding 3 *anupurvis* to this and subtracting 1 *samyagmithyatva* nature, the *anudaya* in the third *gunasthan* is 22 and the *udaya vyuchchitti* is 1. Subtracting the 1 *udaya vyuchchitti* nature from the 100 *udaya yogya* natures of the third *gunasthan*, 66 remain. Adding 4 *anupurvis* and 1 *samyaktava* nature to these, the *udaya yogya* natures in the fourth *gunasthan* are 104. Adding the 1 *udaya vyuchchitti* nature to the 22 *anudaya* natures from the previous *anudaya*, we get 23. Subtracting 4 *anupurvis* and 1 *samyaktava* nature from these, the *anudaya* in the fourth *gunasthan* is 18 and the *udaya vyuchchitti* is 17. Subtracting the 17 *udaya vyuchchitti* natures from the 104 *udaya yogya* natures of the fourth *gunasthan*, the *udaya yogya* natures in the fifth *gunasthan* are 87. Adding the 17 *udaya vyuchchitti* natures to the 18 *anudaya* natures from the previous *anudaya*, the fifth *gunasthan*

My *anudaya* is 35 and *udaya vyuchchitti* is 8. Out of the 87 *prakritis* eligible for *udaya* in the fifth *gunasthan*, subtracting the 8 *prakritis* of *udaya vyuchchitti* and removing the *aaharaka* pair, there are -1 *prakritis* eligible for *udaya* in the *matam muga*. Adding the *prakritis* of *udaya vyuchchitti* to the previous *anudaya* of 35 *prakritis* and subtracting the *aaharaka* pair, there are 41 *prakritis* eligible for *anudaya* and the *udaya vyuchchitti* is 5. Subtracting the 5 *prakritis* of *udaya vyuchchitti* from the 81 *prakritis* eligible for *udaya* in the sixth *gunasthan*, there are 76 *prakritis* eligible for *udaya* in the seventh *gunasthan*. Adding the 5 *prakritis* of *udaya vyuchchitti* to the previous *anudaya* of 41 *prakritis*, there are 46 *prakritis* eligible for *anudaya* in the seventh *gunasthan* and the *udaya vyuchchitti* is 4. Subtracting the 4 *prakritis* of *udaya vyuchchitti* from the 76 *prakritis* eligible for *udaya* in the seventh *gunasthan*, there are 72 *prakritis* eligible for *udaya* in the eighth *gunasthan*. Adding the 4 *prakritis* of *udaya vyuchchitti* to the previous *anudaya* of 46 *prakritis*, there are 50 *prakritis* eligible for *anudaya* in the eighth *gunasthan* and the *udaya vyuchchitti* is 6. Subtracting the 6 *prakritis* of *udaya vyuchchitti* from the 72 *prakritis* eligible for *udaya* in the eighth *gunasthan*,

In the ninth *guṇasthāna*, there are 66 *prakṛtis* eligible for *udaya* (arising). Adding the 6 *prakṛtis* of *udaya-vyuccheddi* (arising-ceasing) to the 50 *prakṛtis* of the previous *anudaya* (non-arising), there are 56 *prakṛtis* eligible for *anudaya* in the ninth *guṇasthāna*, and 6 *prakṛtis* of *udaya-vyuccheddi*. Subtracting the 6 *prakṛtis* of *udaya-vyuccheddi* from the 66 *prakṛtis* eligible for *udaya* in the ninth *guṇasthāna*, there are 60 *prakṛtis* eligible for *udaya* in the tenth *guṇasthāna*. Adding the 6 *prakṛtis* of *udaya-vyuccheddi* to the 56 *prakṛtis* of the previous *anudaya*, there are 62 *prakṛtis* eligible for *anudaya*, and 1 *prakṛti* of *udaya-vyuccheddi*. Subtracting the 1 *prakṛti* of *udaya-vyuccheddi* from the 60 *prakṛtis* eligible for *udaya* in the tenth *guṇasthāna*, there are 56 *prakṛtis* eligible for *udaya* in the eleventh *guṇasthāna*. Adding the 1 *prakṛti* of *udaya-vyuccheddi* to the 62 *prakṛtis* of the previous *anudaya*, there are 63 *prakṛtis* eligible for *anudaya*. There are 2 *prakṛtis* of *udaya-vyuccheddi*. Subtracting the 2 *prakṛtis* of *udaya-vyuccheddi* from the 56 *prakṛtis* eligible for *udaya* in the eleventh *guṇasthāna*, there are 57 *prakṛtis* eligible for *udaya* in the twelfth *guṇasthāna*. Adding the 2 *prakṛtis* of *udaya-vyuccheddi* to the 63 *prakṛtis* of the previous *anudaya*, there are 65 *prakṛtis* eligible for *anudaya*, and 16 *prakṛtis* of *udaya-vyuccheddi*. In the twelfth *guṇasthāna*, 
(UE)

Page #85:
---------------------------
Of the 57 **prakritis** eligible for **udaya**, 16 **prakritis** of **udaya vyuchchitti** are reduced and 1 **tirthankara** **prakriti** is added, resulting in 42 **prakritis** eligible for **udaya** in the **Trayodasha Gunasthan**. Similarly, in the **anudaya** of 65 **prakritis**, 16 **prakritis** of **udaya vyuchchitti** are added and 1 **tirthankara** **prakriti** is subtracted, resulting in 80 **prakritis** of **anudaya** and 30 **prakritis** of **udaya vyuchchitti**. In the **Trayodasha Gunasthan**, 30 **prakritis** of **udaya vyuchchitti** are reduced from the 42 **prakritis** eligible for **udaya**, leaving 12 **prakritis** eligible for **udaya** in the **Chaturdasha Gunasthan**. In the previous **anudaya** of 80 **prakritis**, 30 **prakritis** of **udaya vyuchchitti** are added, resulting in 110 **prakritis** of **anudaya** and 12 **prakritis** of **udaya vyuchchitti**. Thus, in the fourteen **gunasthanas** from **mithyadrishti** onwards, there is a plan of **udaya tribhangi**.

**Question:** What is the difference between **udaya** and **udirana**?

**Answer:** The attainment of the fruits of **karmas** according to the creation of **nisheka** after the completion of **avabadha** is called **udaya**, and the emergence of **karmas** into **udaya** before the **avabadhakal** due to specific reasons is called **udirana**.

207. Question: What is the special characteristic of karma-prakritis in comparison to uday and udirana? Answer: Except for the three gunasthanas of pramatta-samyata, sayog-kevali and ayog-kevali, there is no special characteristic in uday and udirana in comparison to swamitva in other gunasthanas. From the 42 prakritis, which are the combined 30 prakritis of uday-vyuchchitti of sayog-kevali and the 12 prakritis of uday-vyuchchitti of ayog-kevali, one should subtract the three tan-prakritis of satavedaniya, asatavedaniya and manushyayu. The udirana of these three subtracted prakritis occurs in the sixth gunasthan called pramatta-virata, and the udirana of the remaining 36 prakritis occurs in sayog-kevali, and there their udirana-vyuchchitti also occurs. Ayog-kevali does not have udirana. 205. Question: In which gunasthanas does the udirana-vyuchchitti of how many prakritis occur? Answer: From the mithyadristi gunasthan to the sayog-kevali gunasthan, the udirana-vyuchchitti of 5, 6, 1, 17, 8, 8, 4, 6, 6, 1, 2, 16 and 36 prakritis occurs respectively.

210. Question: How many types of Anudeerna are there in each Gunasthan?
Answer: From Mithyadrishti to Sayog Kevali Gunasthan, there are 5, 11, 22, 18, 35, 41, 46, 53, 56, 65, 66, 68 and 83 types of Anudeerna respectively.
Udeerna should be planned according to the Trimanghi scheme of Udar Tribhangi.
211. Question: Who does not experience death?
Answer: Those with mixed Gunasthan, those who possess the Nirvritti Paryaptak state, mixed-body Yogis, those in the Kshapak category, Upsham

While ascending the श्रेणी, humans situated in the first part of the अपूर्वकरण गुणस्थान, as well as those with प्रथमोगा सम्यग्मृति and those in the 2-3-4 गुणस्थानवर्ती नारकी, do not attain death. Similarly, one who attains मिथ्यात्व after the विसंयोजना of अनन्तानुबन्धी does not die until the अन्तर्मुहूर्त, and one who destroys दर्शन मोहनीय does not die until कृतकृत्यता remains. 212. Question: Where is a कृतकृत्य वेदक सम्यग्दृष्टि born after death? Answer: The time of a वृद्धायुष्क कृतकृत्यवेदक सम्यग्दृष्टi is अन्तर्मुहूर्त. It should be divided into four parts. One who dies in the first part is born among the देवों, one who dies in the second part is born among the देव and मनुष्यों, one who dies in the third part is born among the देव-मनुष्य-तिर्यंचों, and one who dies in the fourth part is born in any of the four गति. 1. There are two उपदेश (opinions) on this subject. According to one उपदेश, a कृतकृत्यदेदक सम्यग्दृष्टि जीव does not die, and according to the other उपदेश, it does die. (Param Pujya Jayadvala Pu. 2, p. 315, 216 etc.) (3)

Keep in mind that the first hell-born being will be born in hell, the **tithanch** born among humans will be born among humans, and the **vaimanik** born among gods will be born among gods.

|| Thus ends the third chapter. ||

1. It is also noteworthy that the **prakirnak**, **abhiyogy**, and **kilvishak** are not born even among gods. (Dhavala 1/336)

**Question 213:** What is sattva?
**Answer:** When bound, the attachment of the karma-pradesh to the atma-pradeshas according to their respective states is called sattva.

**Question 214:** What is the arrangement of karma-sattva in the gunasthans?
**Answer:** In the first gunasthan, the tirthankara and the aharaka couple do not exist together. In the second sasadan gunasthan, the tirthankara nature and the aharaka couple do not exist sequentially or simultaneously. In the third misranam gunasthan, the tirthankara nature does not exist. This means that beings with the above-mentioned natures will not have the above-mentioned gunasthans.

**Question 215:** What is the arrangement for obtaining samyaktvam, deshavrat, and mahavat after the ayubandha is complete?
**Answer:** When the ayu of all four gatis is bound, samyakdarshan can be obtained, but except for devayu, other ayus 
(85)

Page #91:
---------------------------
When bound, there are no *anuvrata* and *mahavrata* in that *paryaya*. This means that in the fourth *gunasthan*, called *avirata samyagdristi*, there can be the existence of all four *ayus* in relation to the *bhujyaman* *ayu* of various beings. The peculiarity is that in the *dev* and *narak* realms, there will be bondage of only human and *tiryach* *ayus*, and bondage related to all four *ayus* of humans and *tiryachs* is possible. When a new *ayu* is bound, the existence of two *ayus* arises due to the distinction between *badyaman* and *bhujyaman* of a being. Before the binding of a new *ayu*, there is only the existence of one *bhujyaman* *ayu*. A being of the *kshapika* category is a *tadhva* seeker of liberation, therefore, it does not have the binding of a new *ayu*. There is only the existence of one *bhujyaman* human *ayu*. If a being of the *upshama* category is *baddhayushk*, then there will be the existence of two *ayus*: *bhujyaman* human *ayu* and *badyaman* *devayu*. And if it is *abaddhayushk*, then there will be only the existence of one *bhujyaman* human *ayu*. The attainment of *kshayika samyagdarshan* happens for a human in the *karmabhumij* from the fourth *gunasthan* to the seventh *gunasthan*. Its *anantaanubandhi* *chatushk* and the *mithyatva*, *samyakmithyatva*, and *samyaktva* natures, these seven natures are destroyed.
(86)

Therefore, they do not exist.
116. Question: How many **prakritis** exist in each **guna-sthana**?
Answer: In the **mithyadrishti** **guna-sthana**, there are 148 **prakritis** in existence, as per the existence of various beings. In **sasadan**, there are 145 **prakritis** in existence, as **tirthankara** and **aaharaka** are not present. In the **misra** **guna-sthana**, there are 147 **prakritis** in existence, as the **tirthankara** **prakriti** is not present. In the fourth **guna-sthana**, there are 148 **prakritis** in existence, as the seven **ananta-anubandhi** **prakritis** exist in the form of **upshama**. In the fifth **desh-vrata** **guna-sthana**, there are 1457 **prakritis** in existence, as the **naraka-ayu** is not present. In the sixth **guna-sthana**, called **pramatta-virata**, there are 146 **prakritis** in existence, as the **naraka** and **tiryanch-ayu** are not present. Similarly, in the seventh **guna-sthana**, called **aprammatta-virata**, there are also 146 **prakritis** in existence. From the fourth **guna-sthana** to the seventh **guna-sthana**, there is an absence of the seven **ananta-anubandhi** **prakritis**, including **kshayika** **samyagdristi**, resulting in 141 **prakritis** in existence. In the eighth **guna-sthana**, there is an absence of the aforementioned seven **prakritis**, along with **naraka**, **tiryanch**, and **deva-ayu**, for those belonging to the **kshapka** category. Therefore, there are 138 **prakritis** in existence. At the beginning of the ninth **guna-sthana**, called **anivrittikaran**, there are also 138 **prakritis** in existence. Afterwards,
(87)

Page #93:
---------------------------
A human being in the Kshapaka category has nine parts, and the destruction of 16, 8, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, and 1 natures in order results in the destruction of 36 natures. Therefore, the tenth Gunasthan has a state of 102. At the end of the tenth, the destruction of subtle greed also occurs, leaving a state of 101 in the twelfth Gunasthan. In the twelfth Gunasthan, the destruction of 16 sattva occurs, resulting in a state of 85 in the thirteenth Gunasthan. No nature is destroyed in the thirteenth Gunasthan, so the fourteenth Gunasthan also has a state of 85. Subsequently, in the penultimate time, 73 natures are destroyed, and in the final time, 12 natures are destroyed, causing the soul to become completely free from karma. If a person in the Upshama category is a Kshayika Samyagdarshi and has already bound a new lifespan, then their state will remain at 138 + 1 = 139 until the Upshant Moh Gunasthan. If they are Abaddhayushk, then their state will be 138. If they are a Dvitiyopshama Samyagdarshi, then the disassociation of the infinite Anubandhi Chatushk results in a state of 14.

217. Question: In the Sarak श्रेणी (category) of the Kāla (time) Nāmar (name) Guṇapan (quality), how do the Prakṛtis (principles) decay? Answer: The Navam (ninth) Guṇasthān (stage of spiritual progress) has nine parts. In the first part, the following sixteen Prakṛtis decay: Narakagati (hellish existence), Narakagatyānupūrvi (existence preceding hell), Tiryaṅgati (animal existence), Tiryaṅgatyānupūrvi (existence preceding animal existence), Dwīndriya (two-sense), Trīndriya (three-sense), Chaturindriya (four-sense) Jāti (species), Styāna (stupor), Gṛddhi (greed), Nidrā (sleep), Prachalā (restlessness), Udyota (brightness), Ātap (heat), Ekendriya (one-sense) Jāti, Sādhāraṇa (ordinary), Sūkṣma (subtle), and Sādhāraṇa. In the second part, the following eight Prakṛtis decay: Apratyākhyānāvaraṇa Chatuṣka (fourfold non-rejection veil) and Pratyākhyānā Chatuṣka (fourfold rejection veil). In the third part, one Napuṃsakaved (non-masculine knowledge) decays. In the fourth part, one Strīved (feminine knowledge) decays. In the fifth part, six No Kṣayās (non-passions) decay. In the sixth part, one Puruṣaved (masculine knowledge) decays. In the seventh part, one Sanjvalana Krodha (burning anger) decays. In the eighth part, Sanjvalanāmāna (burning pride) decays. And in the ninth part, Sanjvalanāmāyā (burning delusion) decays. 21. Question: Which one Prakṛti decays in the Dasam (tenth) Guṇasthān? Answer: Sanjvalana Lobha (burning greed), this one Prakṛti decays at the end of the Dasam Guṇasthān. It does not decay for those in the Upaśānta (calm) Moh (delusion) Guṇasthān, who are in the Kṣapaka (destructive) श्रेणी (category), but only for those in the Upaśama (subduing) श्रेणी (category).

And in it, there is no decay of any nature. 216. Question: Which are the sixteen natures that are destroyed in the twelfth *guna-sthana*? Answer: In the penultimate time of the twelfth *guna-sthana*, *nidra* and *prachala* are destroyed, and in the final time, five of *jnana-avaran*, four of *darshan-avaran*, and five of *antaraya*, thus a total of fourteen, making sixteen natures destroyed. 220. Question: Which are the sixty-five natures that are destroyed in the *ayog kevali guna-sthana*? Answer: From the five bodies to *sparsha-namakarma*, fifty *sthira*, *asthira*, *shubha*, *ashubha*, *susvara*, *duhsvara*, *devagati*, *devagaty-anupurvi*, *prashasta vihayogati*, *aprashasta vihayogati*, *durbhaga*, *nirmana*, *ayashaskirti*, *anadeya*, *pratyek*, *aparyapta*, *agurulaghu*, *upghata*, *parghata*, *uchchvasa*, *vedaniya* from the seven *asa-ta-vedaniya*, one *anudaya* form, and *nicha gotra*, these seventy-three natures are destroyed in the penultimate time, and one *vedaniya*, *manushya-gati*, *panchendriya jati*, *subhaga*, *basa*, *badara*, *paryapti*, *adeya*, *yashaskirti*, *tirthankara prakriti*, *manushyayu*, and *uchcha gotra*, these twelve natures are destroyed in the final time, attaining fear. (60)

---------------------------
221. Question: How is the subsidence of the remaining 21 natures of the *charitra mohaniya* of the *upshama* category? Answer: The order of subsidence in the *upshama* category is similar to the *kshapana* method, but there is a special feature, which is that in the second part of the six parts of *anivrittikaran*, the *apratyakhyanavaran* and *pratyakhyanavaran* quartet, these eight *kashyas* do not subside, but they subside before *purushaved* and *sanjwalan*, and their order is such that after the subsidence of *purushaved*, the subsidence of both *apratyakhyan* and *pratyakhyan* anger occurs, and then the subsidence of *sanjwalan* anger occurs. This order should also be known in *manadi*.

222. Question: What is *ubelan*?
Answer: Just as the force of a tied rope is removed by turning it backwards, similarly, the bound nature is destroyed by transforming it into another nature form with the special characteristics of the backward results, i.e., not allowing its fruit to arise in *udaya*, is called *udvelana*. The *udvelit* nature does not remain true to its form.

Page #97:
---------------------------
223. Question: Of which natures is there an *udvelana*? Answer: *Aharak* body, *Aharak* body parts, *Samyaktva* nature, *Samyamithyatva* nature, *Devagati*, *Devagatyānupūrvi*, *Narakagati*, *Narakagatyānupūrvi*, *Vaikriyik* body parts, *Manushyagati*, *Manushyagatyānupūrvi*, and *Uchcha Gotra*, these thirteen natures have *udvelana*. When there is *udvelana*, their essence does not remain. 224. Question: Does the *udvelit* nature come back into existence? Answer: It does, just like the *Anadi Mithya Drishti* in the middle of *Liv* has the essence of 26 natures, which after attaining *Upsham Samyagdarshan* becomes 28 natures by dividing the *Mithyatva* nature into three parts: *Mithyatva*, *Samyamithyatva*, and *Samyaktva*. Later, becoming *Mithyadrishti*, it becomes 27 or 26 natures by *udvelana* of one or both of *Samyamithyatva* and *Samyaktva* nature in the countless parts of *Palyopam*. Later, after attaining *Samyagdarshan* again, it obtains the essence of *Samyamithyatva* and *Samyaktva* nature by dividing the *Mithyatva* nature into three parts.

236. Question: How does transition occur? Answer: Transition of the fundamental natures does not occur, i.e., the *pradeshas* of *jnanavarana* etc. do not become *darshanavarana* etc. *Darshan* does not become *mohaniya*, *charitra* does not become *mohaniya*. The four divisions of *ayukarma* never become *alpa ayu*. The transition of the remaining natures occurs. The transition of the *samyaktva* nature from *asanyata samyagdristi* to *aprammatta* *sanyata* *gunasthan* does not occur. Similarly, the transition of the *mithyatva* nature does not occur in the *mithyatva* *gunasthan*, and the transition of *samyag mithyatva* does not occur in the *misra* *gunasthan*. The transition of the three divisions of *darshan mohaniya* does not occur in the *sasadan* and *misra* *gunasthan*. The transition of *darshan mohaniya* from the general state occurs in the four *gunasthanas* of *asanyata* etc.
237. Question: What is the nature of *udvelan* transition? Answer: The transformation of *karma* atoms into other nature forms without the three causal forms of *adhah pravritti* etc. is called *udvelan* transition. This occurs only in the 13 natures of *aharaka* *dwika* etc.

Its nature is as follows: 1. The connection of karmas with the soul is bandha. 2. The increase in the state and section of karmas is utkarṣaṇa. 3. The transformation of the bandha-rupa prakriti into another form is saṃkramaṇa. 4. The decrease in the state and section of karmas is apakṣaṇa. 5. Bringing the karma-dravya located outside the udayavali into the udayavali time by the force of apakṣaṇa is udīraṇā.
6. The karma-rupa remaining of the bound karma-pudgala is sattv.
7. The karma-pradeshas start giving fruits is uday.
8. The karma not being obtained in the udayavali for a definite time is upasama.

Answer: This being can abandon and again acquire the four, namely, prathamopasama samyaktv, kṣayopasamik samyaktv, deśavrata and anantānubandhi, as many times as there are moments in the countless parts of a palya, at most. Afterwards, it attains the Siddha-pad by rule.
244. Question: How many times can this being ascend the upasama category at most?
Answer: The being can ascend the upasama category at most twice in one paryaya and four times in all paryayas. Afterwards, it attains liberation by the destruction of karma. The kṣapaka category is attained only once. From that one category, liberation is attained by the destruction of karma.

245. Question: How many times does one have to attain the *Bhavalingi Muni* state?
Answer: One has to attain the *Bhavalingi Muni* state a maximum of 32 times. Liberation is attained definitely from the third *Muni* state. The *Dravyalingi Muni* state can be attained an infinite number of times. Some attain liberation by attaining the *Bhavalingi Muni* state only once. 

246. Question: What are the general causes (reasons) for the bondage of karma?
Answer: Generally, *Mithyatva*, *Avirati* *Kashaya*, and *Yoga* are the four causes of bondage. Sometimes *Pramada* is also considered a cause of bondage, but here it is included in *Kashaya*. In the first *Gunasthan*, all four causes of bondage are present. In the three *Gunasthanas* from *Sāsādana* to *Samyagdṛṣṭi*, bondage occurs due to these three causes: *Avirati*, *Kashaya*, and *Yoga*. In the *Deśa-saṃyata* *Gunasthan*, *Avirati* is abandoned, and the second cause called *Avirati* is present along with *Virati*. The remaining *Kashaya* and *Yoga* are fully present. From *Pramatta-saṃyata* to *Sūkṣma-sāṃpārāya*, there are five

In the Gunasthans, there are two types of Pratyaya: Kshaya and Yoga. From Upshant Moh to Sayogkevali, there is only Yoga Pratyaya in the three Gunasthans. In the fourteenth Gunasthan, called Ayog Kevali, there is not even a single Pratyaya of Bandha, hence there is complete Abandha, meaning no Bandha of any Prakruti. 247. Question: How many answers are there for the above four Pratyaya? Answer: There are 5 for Mithyatva, 12 for Avirati, 25 for Kshaya and 15 for Yoga, thus there are 57 different answers for Pratyaya in total. There are 5 types of Mithyatva due to the differences in Ekant, Vipreet, Sanshay, Agnan and Vainayik. There are 6 types of Pran-Avirati due to the lack of restraint from violence towards the Shatkayik Jivas and 6 types of Indriya Avirati due to the lack of restraint from the objects of the six senses, thus there are 12 types of Avirati. There are 25 types of Kshaya due to the 16 Anantanu bandhi Kshaya like Krodh, Man, Maya, Lom etc. and 6 No Kshaya like Hasya etc. There are 7 types of Kay Yoga, 4 types of Bachan Yoga and 4 types of Mano Yoga, thus there are 15 types of Yoga. One should plan these 57 Pratyaya in the Gunasthans.

The substance of the *Prabuddha* becomes progressively inferior in a multiplied manner. This process of deterioration is called *guna-hani* (loss of merit). For example, a being at one time bound *Prabuddha* in the form of a group of 6300 atoms, and it had a state of 48 *kalas*. In this, there were 6 *guna-hanis* in the form of a group of various *guna-hanis*. Of these, the first *guna-hani* lost 3280, the second *guna-hani* lost 1600, the third *guna-hani* lost 800, the fourth *guna-hani* lost 400, the fifth *guna-hani* lost 200, and the sixth *guna-hani* lost 100 *karma* atoms.

**Question 1268:** What is meant by *guna-hani-ayāma*?

**Answer:** The extent of time for one *guna-hani* is called *guna-hani-ayāma*. For example, in the above illustration, the state of the *Prabuddha* was 48 *kalas*, and there were 6 *guna-hanis*. Therefore, dividing 48 by 6, the extent (duration) of one *guna-hani* is 8 *kalas*. This is called *guna-hani-ayāma*.

The actual measure of the *Prabuddha* is multiplied by an infinite number of *sindhus* and an infinite number of *abhyavyarashis*. Here, for the sake of illustration, 6300 has been assumed.

266. Question: What is Nana Gunhani? Answer: Nana Gunhani is the group of Gun Hanis. For example, in the above illustration, there are 6 Gun Hanis of 8-8 times. This number 6 is the quantity of Nana Gunhani. 270. Question: What is Anyonyabhyast Rashi? Answer: The quantity obtained by writing two-two in the quantity of Nana Gunhani and multiplying them mutually is called Anyonyabhyast Rashi. For example, in the above illustration, the quantity of Nana Gunhani is 6, so by writing two-two in 6 places and multiplying them mutually, we get 64. 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 64. This is Anyonyabhyast Rashi. 271. Question: What is the method of extracting the substance of the last Gunhani? Answer: Dividing the substance of the time-bound by one less than the Anyonyabhyast Rashi gives the substance of the last Gunhani. For example, in the above illustration, the quantity of Anyonyabhyast is 64, subtracting 1 from it gives 63. Dividing this by the quantity of the time-bound 6300 gives the substance of the last Gunhani. . .

Dravy 100 came. 272. Question: How is the dravy of other guna-hanis derived?
Answer: By doubling the dravy of the last guna-hani till the first guna-hani, the dravy of other guna-hanis is derived.
For example, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200. 273. Question: How is the dravy of the first and subsequent times of each guna-hani derived?
Answer: By multiplying the chaya with the quantity of the guna-hani aayam in the nishekahar form, the quantity of the dravy of the first time of each guna-hani is derived, and by subtracting one chaya from it, the quantity of the dravy of the subsequent times is derived. For example, in the above illustration, the quantity of the aayam of the various guna-hanis was 8, from which the quantity of the nishekahar was 16. Therefore, by multiplying the chaya 32 with the nishekahar 16, the dravy of the first time of the first guna-hani is 512. By subtracting one chaya 32 from it, the quantity of the dravy of the second and subsequent times is derived as 480, 448, 416, 384, 352, 320, 288 respectively.

Similarly, the substance of each time of the second and other qualities should be removed.
274. Question: What is called *chay*?
Answer: In the mathematics of *shreni vyavahar*, the magnitude of equal loss or equal increase is called *chay*.
275. Question: What is the method of calculating the magnitude of *chay* in this case?
Answer: By adding one more *guna hani* dimension to the *nishekahar* and dividing by two, the resulting value is multiplied by the *guna hani* dimension. Dividing the product by the substance of the desired *guna hani* gives the magnitude of *chay* for the desired *guna hani*. For example, in *nishekahar* 16, adding one more *guna hani* dimension gives 25. Half of that, 12.5, is multiplied by the *guna hani* dimension, *p*, to get 100. Dividing this by the substance of each desired *guna hani* gives the *chay* of the first and other *guna hani*s in order: 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.

. Footnote 1 on page 116. Note- This statement regarding the Tribhanga of all beings is expected in the Kshapaka category. In the Upshama category, the same thing is true up to the sixth Gunasthan, and from the seventh to the Shevashanta Kashaya Gunasthan, for each Gunasthan, the Asattva Prakriti should be said to be "2", the Sattva Prakriti "146", and the Sattva Vyuchchitti Prakriti "". This statement is also expected from the view that does not accept the rule of disassociation of the Anantanubandhi in the Dvitiyopshama Samyaktv. (120)
