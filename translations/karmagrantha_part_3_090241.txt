**Illumination [First Edition]**
**Shri**
**Kesari Sahitya Prakashan Samiti**

One of the primary and creative objectives of the Kesari Sahitya Prakashan Samiti is to publish literature related to Jainism and Daman. The institution's guide, the highly revered Shri Marudhar Kesariji Maharaj, is himself a great scholar, poet, and master of Jain Agamas and Daman. Under his guidance, the institution's various philanthropic activities are ongoing. Gurudevshri is also a connoisseur of literature and a visionary. Inspired by him, we have published discourses, biographies, poetry, Agamas, and profound analytical works. Now, we are presenting his long-awaited work, "Karmagranth Vivechan," to scholars and discerning readers.

Karmagranth is a great text of Jain philosophy. It encompasses a comprehensive analysis of Jain metaphysics. Under the guidance of the revered Gurudevshri, renowned author-editor Shriyut Shrichandji Surana and his associate Shri Devkumarji Jain have jointly edited this work beautifully. With the inspiration of the ascetic Shri Rajtamuni Ji and the scholar Shri Suknamuni Ji, this grand project is being completed in a timely and beautiful manner. The sponsorship of this book is being provided by Shriman Stria Ji Mohanlalji Sethia, Mysore, and Shriman Seth Merumal Ji Rofa, Secunderabad. We express our heartfelt gratitude to all scholars, monks, and supportive generous householders and hope that we will soon present the complete Karma Vivechan to readers in other parts of the book. The first and second parts have already reached the hands of readers some time ago. Scholars and readers have welcomed them. Now, this third part is being presented to the readers.

The second edition of the Karmagranth, Part 3, was published in 1965. The entire stock of Parts 1, 2, and 3 was exhausted in these five years, and the demand from readers continues unabated. Seeing the utility of the book and the interest of the readers, the committee had already undertaken the reprinting of Parts 1 and 2. Now, Part 3, in its second edition, is presented for the service of the readers.

In this edition, most of the printing errors have been corrected, and some revisions and additions have also been made. Due to the rising inflation, the cost of printing the book has increased considerably, yet we have maintained the same old price.

In the printing of this edition, Shriman Jalmal Chandji Bafna (Bhopalgarh) has generously provided full financial assistance. He himself is a devout Jain and a righteous person. He has a deep understanding of Tattvajnan. His entire family is very noble and cultured. We express our heartfelt gratitude for the generous donation you have given to the institution's literature.

## Editorial

The key to understanding Jain philosophy is the 'Karma Siddhanta'. It is certain that the foundation of the entire philosophy and knowledge is the soul and the discussion of the various states and forms of the soul, and the 'Karma Siddhanta' reveals the mystery of its transformations. Therefore, to understand Jain philosophy, 'Karma Siddhanta' is essential.

The major texts that discuss 'Karma Siddhanta' include 'Shrimad Devendrasuri Rachit Karma'. These hold a special significance. They occupy a very important place in Jain literature. Those seeking knowledge consider Karma as a subject of daily study and self-study, like fire.

The Sanskrit commentaries on Karma texts are very important. There are also many Gujarati translations of these. The first discussion of Karma texts in Hindi was presented by the wise and learned scholar, Mahakshak Pandit Sukhlalji. His comparison is both comparative and scholarly. Pandit Sukhlalji's essay is now almost inaccessible. For some time, there has been inspiration from Ashukavi Ratna Gurudevshri Marudharakesariji Maharaj to present a modern discussion of Karma texts. This editing began with his inspiration and guidance. With the inspiration of Vidya Vinod Shri Sumuniji, this work progressed rapidly. With the help of Shri Devkumarji Jain, the work became ready to take shape in a short time.

This editing work has received the support of ancient text writers, commentators, discussants, and especially the works of Pandit Sukhlalji.

---------------------------
And thus, the contemplation of such profound others has become comprehensible. I express my gratitude with boundless appreciation to all the learned scholars.
The timely guidance of the invincible Shri Marudharakesari Ji M., the inspiration of Shri Rajtamuni Ji and Shri Sukhanamuni Ji, and the cooperation of the officials of the Sahitya Samiti, especially the heartfelt inspiration and cooperation of the Samiti's administrator Shri Subhanmal Ji Sethia, have brought dynamism to the editing and publication of the book. I accept this with heartfelt gratitude, and it will be truly fitting.
If there are any errors, semantic mistakes, ambiguities, or impurities in printing, etc., in the contemplation, I humbly apologize and request the readers with discerning minds to kindly point them out and forgive me. Those who help in correcting errors and avoiding mistakes are commendable. - With this request,
Humble ... Shriman Sukrana 'Saras'

The **Ātmā** is the foundation of all the thinking, contemplation, and analysis of Jain philosophy. The **Ātmā** is an all-pervading, independent power. It is the creator of its own happiness and sorrow, and it is also the one who experiences the fruits of its actions. The **Ātmā** is inherently pure, but it is wandering in the world in an impure state, embodied with the body. Even though it is inherently blissful, it is being ground down by happiness and sorrow. Even though it is immortal, it is flowing in the stream of birth and death. The **Ātmā**, which is supremely powerful, is also experiencing suffering and pain in the world in the form of poverty, misery, and suffering. What is the reason for this?

Jain philosophy, while analyzing this reason, says that **karma** is what makes the **Ātmā** wander in the world. **Karma** is the root of birth and death. "**Karma** is the root of death" - this statement of Bhagwan Shri Mahavira is absolutely true, a fact. Due to **karma**, this world is constantly changing in various strange cycles of events. While theistic philosophies have attributed the cause of this world's diversity and happiness and sorrow to God, Jain philosophy has attributed the cause of all happiness and sorrow and the world's diversity primarily to the **jīva** and its main helper, **karma**. **Karma** is not an independent power; it is itself **pudgala**, inert. But when **karma** is performed by the **Ātmā** due to attachment and aversion, it becomes so powerful and potent that it binds the doer in its own bondage. It makes the master dance like a servant. This is the strange power of **karma**. What is this **karma**, the main seed of all the changes in our life and the world? What is its nature? How do its methods and results occur? This is a very serious subject.

Karma is described in great detail in Jainism. A very subtle and profound examination of karma is found in the Jain Agamas and subsequent texts. It is written in Prakrit and Sanskrit, making it accessible but difficult for the average seeker to understand. Ancient Acharyas have described the various forms of karma theory in brief, which proves to be a good source of knowledge for the average seeker of truth when memorized.

The Karmagranth holds an important place in the ancient texts of the Jain faith. The five parts of this work, written by Shrimad Devendrasur, are extremely important. They present a discussion of all Jain philosophy, including karma theory, gunasthan, maganna, jiva, and ajiva, along with their various distinctions. The text is in complex Prakrit and has many famous commentaries in Sanskrit. It is also well-known in Gujarati. A commentary on it in Hindi was prepared by the famous scholar Pt. Sukhlalji about 40 years ago.

Currently, a Hindi commentary on the Karmagranth was available. Then, there was a significant change in the way it was being studied. Many learned monks and lay devotees had been requesting for years that a work as vast and profound as the Karmagranth should be re-interpreted and published in a new way. Only a capable scholar like you, a great saint and master of the scriptures, could undertake this extremely laborious and expensive task. There was also a desire for this. The body has become quite old. Even now, you spend more than 10-12 hours a day engaged in scriptural study, literary creation, and other activities. Last year, Suredevatri resolved to take this work forward. She began writing the commentary. The responsibility for making the language of the commentary beautiful and engaging, collecting footnotes and quotations from the Agamas, writing the introduction, and other tasks was entrusted to the renowned scholar Shriyut Shrichand Gurana.

Shri Muranaji Gurudevshri is in very close contact with the literature and the vices. Under the guidance of Bhurudeva, he has prepared this Visapuu, which is useful for the common people, with great effort. This Vivēcan is fulfilling the long-standing lack of Shaka. At the same time, the society is getting a cultural and philosophical treasure in the form of a treasure, which is a matter of great satisfaction.
I have a special interest in this subject? I have been inspiring Gurudev and the editor brothers from time to time to fulfill this. After the first and second parts, this third part is in front of the public. I am very happy about it.
It has been reported that the first two parts have been liked by the inquisitive readers and have been helpful in their self-knowledge. Hopefully, like the first and second parts, this third part will also be more useful in increasing knowledge.

## Proposal No.

In the scriptures of karma, the concepts of *Jiva-sthana* (abode of the soul), *Margana-sthana* (path of the soul), and *Guna-sthana* (state of the soul) are explained. These three categories are a detailed examination of the variations of worldly beings, their *Vikas* (evolution), *Sukha* (happiness), and *Dukha* (suffering) in the form of *Kava* (covering). 

*Jiva-sthana* describes the physical forms and types of worldly beings, ranging from the dense karmic state of the soul in various *Guna-sthana* (states of qualities) to the ultimate pure development, the radiant and supreme state. *Margana-sthana* classifies the soul's external (physical) and internal (spiritual) states, outlining their diverse variations. 

From this perspective, *Margana-sthana* acts as a middle ground (threshold) similar to the *Kshepaka Nyaya* (theory of projection), encompassing both the physical aspects of *Abasthana* (state) and the spiritual aspects of *Guna-sthana*.

Furthermore, *Margana-sthana* has a unique characteristic. While *Jiva-sthana* only describes the types and variations of beings, and *Guna-sthana* informs about the sequential development of the soul through karmic states, they are not interconnected. They are *Krama-bhavi* (sequential). However, *Margana-sthana* is *Saha-bhavi* (co-existent). It is connected to both *Jiva-sthana* and *Guna-sthana*. Beings with both types of characteristics are inevitably included in some *Margana-sthana*.

## My Time

In the world, there are countless beings. Their external and internal lives exhibit a variety of peculiarities, differences, and complexities. There is diversity in their physical forms, shapes, colors, sensory organs, movements, actions, thoughts, and *Sukha* and *Dukha*. Each being is distinct from the other.

Page #14:
---------------------------
It is evident. This difference is so great that it appears to be an amazing museum (treasure house) of all the differences in the seed race.
The diversity of the living world is so immense that even people of the same species cannot be compared to each other. Let us look at our human race itself. We have similar hands, feet, etc., but the form is not the same, some are tall, some are short, some are fair complexioned, some are dark complexioned, etc. This is the difference in physical appearance, but consider the difference in mental appearance, some have dull intelligence and some have sharp intelligence, and there are many types of variations between them. We see these kinds of other differences every day. We experience them as one. There is a plethora of differences even within a species, so how can it be possible to understand the vast differences that exist in other animals, birds, gods, and hellish beings? Nevertheless, all the spiritualists have classified these infinite differences as a path, calling it a path characteristic.....
The living beings existing in the Jithanas and Gunasthanas are called Margana by the emotions or synonyms by which they are traced or lost. _ To make this work of declaration simple and systematic, fourteen divisions of Margana Sthana have been made and these fourteen divisions also have subsequent divisions. Their names and subsequent differences, names etc. are given in this other place in this other place, in which all the infinite differences related to the life and maternal life of all living beings are classified.
In this third Karmagrantha, the bondage of bondage is discussed based on the Gunasthanas based on the Manas, i.e. how many Gunasthanas are possible in which Manas and the abilities of Karmabandha in those Marganavarti beings according to the division of Gunasthanas are discussed. ....... The reason for this is that the differences, diversities existing in the Jithas,

Page #15:
---------------------------
What is the cause? To solve the question of 'what', different philosophers and thinkers have presented their own views and arguments, which are hinted at in the following verse from the Shvetashvatara Upanishad 19...

"Time, nature, destiny, chance, the elements like earth, and the Purusha (soul) - these are the causes of diversity. The soul experiences happiness and sorrow due to these causes. It is not the soul itself. In the same way, other thinkers have presented their own perspectives. If these different views are compiled, a great treatise can be prepared. But here, without going into detail, we will briefly discuss the following views on causes...

1. Time, 2. Nature, 3. Destiny, 4. Chance, 5. Effort, 6. Purusha (God).

All these views contradict each other and claim to be the sole cause of action. Their perspectives are as follows:

**Kalavada** - This philosophy considers time as the primary cause. This philosophy states that every action in the world is happening due to the influence of time. Without time, nature, effort, etc. can do nothing. A person performs a good or bad deed, but its fruit is not received at that time. When the right time comes, its good or bad (auspicious-inauspicious) fruit is received. In time, the sun shines and in winter, it is cold. Similarly, a person cannot do anything on their own, but when the time comes, all actions happen as they should. This is all the glory of time. The perspective of Kalavada is:

"Time ripens all beings, time destroys all beings. Time comes to those who are asleep, time is very difficult to overcome."

1. Mahabharata 1.24

Page #16:
---------------------------
It is Time that creates and destroys the world of beings. Due to the influence of Time, the population expands and contracts. Even when everyone is asleep, Time remains awake. Therefore, Time, the destroyer, is the root cause of the strangeness, diversity, and joys and sorrows of this world.

The doctrine of Svabhavad-Svabhashabada has a unique perspective. It has its own principles! It states that whatever actions are happening in the world are happening due to the influence of their own nature. Without nature, Time, destiny, etc. ... can do nothing. The mango seed has the nature of becoming a mango tree, therefore, a mango tree and fruit are obtained from it, and the neem seed has the nature of becoming a neem tree. Why is neem bitter and sugarcane sweet? The reason is the nature present in them. The following quote is useful for understanding the ideas of Svabhavad:

"The sharpness of thorns, the diversity of feathers in birds, etc. are all due to nature. No other reason for the creation of this world is visible. It is natural - it is inherent, there is no contribution of any other effort in it."

Niyativad considers the immutable laws of nature as destiny. Niyativad says that whatever is destined to happen at a particular time, happens. The sun will rise from the east, the lotus will be born in water, cows, bulls, etc. animals will have four legs and humans will have two hands, two feet. Why does this happen? The only reason is that it is destined to be so. Makkhali Gosala was a follower of this Niyativad. He believed that there is no cause, no reason for the birth, etc. of beings, without reason, without cause, beings experience joy, sorrow, and suffering.

1. Sumamtam Tika

Page #17:
---------------------------
The text discusses different philosophical perspectives on the nature of destiny and free will. 

**Determinism (Niaitivad)**:  
The text cites the *Suchakritanga Tika* 1/1/2, which states that whatever good or bad is destined for humans, it will inevitably happen.  No matter how much effort one puts in, what is not meant to be will not happen, and what is meant to be cannot be stopped.  All beings have a predetermined destiny, and they will experience it according to their situation.

**Chance (Yadrichchavad)**: 
This perspective is used when the cause-and-effect relationship is not clear.  It suggests that events happen randomly, without a clear connection to prior actions.  This view implies a sense of indifference, where there is no opportunity to consider cause and effect.

**Effort (Purusharthavad)**: 
This philosophy emphasizes the importance of effort and action in shaping one's destiny.  It argues that every action in the world requires effort, and without it, nothing can be achieved.  All progress in the world is a result of effort.  For example, if one is hungry, they must make an effort to find food; simply thinking about it will not satisfy the hunger.  While objects have their own inherent nature, their manifestation requires effort.  The text quotes, "Do effort, do effort, for the sake of happiness."

**Theism (Purushvad-Ishwarvad)**: 
This is the most prominent view, which emphasizes the role of God.  The text mentions that the other philosophies are limited in their scope of thinking.

The text also references the *Majjhima Nikaya* 2/3.6, which describes determinism.

Page #18:
---------------------------
Limited and becoming particularly influential in theism, it became extinct in a way and God was primarily considered the cause of this bock-variety and the happiness and sorrow of the living beings.
Purushkar - Generally, man is the doer, destroyer and creator of this world - this opinion is called Purushavaak. There are two thoughts in Purushabad. One is Brahmavad and the other is Ishwarkatu. In Mahabad, Brahma is the cause of all the conscious and unconscious, concrete and abstract substances of the world, and in Ishwarvad, God is self-evident and becomes the cause in the mutual combination of the substances. Brahma and Ishwar, these two distinctions become of Purushavad due to the cause of upadan and the cause of nimis.
The meaning of Brahmavad is that just as a spider is the cause for a web, a banyan tree is the cause for a tree, in the same way, Purusha is the cause of the creation, existence, and destruction of all beings in the world. What has happened, what will happen, who is the master of liberation, who gets growth from food, who is moving, who is still, who is far, who is near, who is present in all the conscious and unconscious, and who is the hair of all, he is Brahma. Therefore, there is no diversity in it, but whatever is seen is seen as the illusion of Brahma, and no one sees Brahma.
1. Karna nama iva ashoonaam chandrakanta iva ambhasam. Prarohaanam iva laksha: sa hetu sarva janminaam.
 - Upanishad 2 (a) Purusha eva idam sartha yad bhutam yantra bhashyam. Uta amritatvasya eshaama yadan nena ati rohati.
...mveva purusha saks (b) Yadejati yannajati yad dure yadantika. Basantarasy sarvaspa yaduta sarvasyaaram chaahata.
—Ishavasya Upanishad (c) Sarva va khalvi dam brahma neha naanaasti kinchan. * Aaram tasya pashyanti na tam pashyati kanchan !!   Chhandogya Uo 3.14

Page #19:
---------------------------
(21)
In Eurvada, God is considered the cause of the creation of objects and beings in the world, and the giver of happiness and sorrow. To support this view, it is argued that the universe, both stationary and mobile (inanimate and animate), is the work of a particular male being. Because earth, trees, etc., are effects, and effects are produced by an intelligent agent, just as pots, etc., are effects and are therefore made by an intelligent agent, so the intelligent agent of these is called God.

Just as God is the creator of the universe, he is also the cause of their attainment of heaven, hell, etc. They experience God -

——
The cause of happiness and sorrow for the beings of the world is God. The beings of the world, due to their humility, hope, and inspiration, experience happiness and sorrow -
——
*Asho*
*Sukhaduhkhayo:*
*Janturameeso'yam atmanah Ishwaraprerito gacchet svarga va shvabhrameva va.*

Similarly, other thinkers have put forward their own views regarding the relationship between the soul and the body, and have refuted the views of others. The result of this refutation and defense has been that confusion has arisen among ordinary people, and those views that could have helped in understanding the truth have become unable to reach the core of the truth due to lack of coordination.

*Shiya: Janna Drishti*

But Bhagwan Mahavira resolved the conflict of ideas regarding the diversity of the world. This solution was done in two ways. Those ideas that could be coordinated were coordinated, and those ideas that were useless were logically refuted, and the root cause of diversity was explained.

*2 Mahabharata Vanaparva*

Page #20:
---------------------------
It has been indicated and presented before the world, the truth that presents useful ideals for the creation of life.
It has been indicated earlier that there are two types of substances in the world... conscious and unconscious. Both these types of substances exhibit diversity. Where there is a relationship between the peculiarities of unconscious substances and the diversities of partially conscious elements, the Jain view is that the combination of time, etc., is the cause. The origin of any work does not happen from only one cause, but the origin of that work happens when all the necessary causes come together. It never happens that one power alone can accomplish its work. Yes, it may be that there is one main cause in a work and others are secondary, but it does not happen that one alone can accomplish the work independently.
This statement is logical and reasonable. We experience this in our daily lives and our perception is also of the same kind. But Purushavada-Brahmavada and Ishwaravada... in the world, the peculiarities and diversities of conscious or unconscious substances in any form... do not become the main or secondary cause. Because in the form in which the nature of Brahma and Ishwara has been considered, its validity is not established and their importance is only harmed. The concept of Purushavada in relation to the world has been hinted at earlier, but to show the futility of that concept, we consider some special points here.
The first form of Purushavada is Brahmavada and its view is that there is one Brahma, it is Sat, it has no other form, but whatever diversity we see is all illusion, that is, it is the Maya of Brahma, but Brahma itself is not visible to anyone and this illusion is a false form, because it appears to be false. What appears to be false is false, it is Asat. Just as there is a false perception of silver in a piece of conch shell. The same...

Page #21:
---------------------------
This visible world-phenomenon appears to be false, therefore it is false. Its other name is Brahmavad. 
But when the aforementioned views of Brahmavad are tested on the touchstone of logic, they appear ridiculous. Firstly, if this phenomenal world is Maya to Brahma, then this Maya is different from Brahma. If it is considered non-different, then we will have to accept the existence of these two substances, Brahma and Maya. In that situation, it cannot be said that there is only one substance, that it is non-dual. If Maya and Brahma are non-different, then the Maya-like nature of this phenomenal world does not become clear. If it is said that Maya is the same as Brahma, then the non-duality is not established because of the existence of two substances, Brahma and Maya. If Maya is considered non-existent, then the origin of the substances of the three worlds cannot happen.
Secondly, it is also worth considering how a single principle can become the material cause for the transformation of different substances? By simply calling all the substances of the world Maya, their separate existence and individuality cannot be destroyed. Their individuality and existence are their own. If one eats food, it does not create food for another. The mouth of one being cannot be considered the mouth of another being. Therefore, it appears imaginary and even pleasing to the imagination to consider only one substance as the material cause for infinite actions by negating the infinite inert and sentient substances of the world. It is against perception to imagine a single real substance by seeing the existence of reality in the substances of the world and considering it as real.
If the existence of this world is established by inference, etc., then because of the separate existence of the reason and the conclusion, the reason is established instead of the conclusion, and there is no real difference between cause and effect, merit and demerit, the fruits of karma, heaven and hell, knowledge and ignorance, bondage and liberation, etc. Therefore, Brahmavad is not suitable for the establishment of the state of perception-established reality.

The second form of male chauvinism is **Ishwarvada-Ishwarkartṛtvavāda**. This world-pervading peculiarity is absolutely **Ishwar** (God). The term **Ishwarkartṛtvavāda** is the essence of this concept.  

**Ishwarvadis** (theists) declare the greatness of **Ishwar** by saying that he is unique, omnipresent, independent, and eternal. The meaning of these adjectives used for **Ishwar** is as follows:

**Ishwar** is one. - This means that he is singular. Because if many **Ishwars** are considered to be the creators of the world, then there will be conflict in their desires, and the creation of one thing in another form will lead to a lack of unity and order in the world.

**Ishwar** is omnipresent. If **Ishwar** is considered to be limited to a particular region, then the proper creation of all substances in unlimited places will not be possible.

**Ishwar** is omniscient. If **Ishwar** is not considered to be omniscient, then he will not be able to create actions according to the appropriate material causes due to his lack of knowledge of them.

**Ishwar** is independent. - This means that he makes all beings experience happiness and sorrow according to his own will.

**Ishwar** is eternal. Eternal means timeless, uncreated, and unchanging. If **Ishwar** is considered to be impermanent, then the creation of one **Ishwar** from another, and another from the second, and so on, will not be possible, and he will become dependent for his existence.

The following arguments are used to support the belief in **Ishwar**:

1. Creation is an act, so there must be a cause for it.
2. At the beginning of creation, there is a connection between two atoms, and from this connection, an atom is created. This act of arrangement must have a doer.
3. Creation must have a basis.

Page #23:
---------------------------
4. - Someone must have taught weaving, pottery, etc. before they were established. Therefore, there must be an original teacher. ..... There must be someone who creates the extreme. 6. - There must be a creator of the Vedas. 7. - A molecule is formed from the combination of two atoms, it must have a mother. The self-proclaimed theories of God are questionable in themselves. Because first it must be considered that in the creation of the universe, is God's intention for himself or for others? God is self-sufficient, all his desires have been fulfilled, therefore he cannot create the universe to fulfill his desires. If God creates the universe for others, then he cannot be called intelligent. In this situation, God's freedom is hindered and he has to depend on the will of others.
God does not create the universe out of compassion either. In that situation, all living beings in the universe should be happy. No one should be unhappy, this is what a compassionate person keeps in mind.
This is also not logical. If God is considered omnipresent in the body, then his pervasiveness in the three worlds will leave no space for other existing substances, and if God is considered omnipresent in terms of knowledge, then it contradicts the Vedas. Because the Vedas say that God is omnipresent:
"Vishvataschala Vishvato Mukho Vishvatah Panistha Vishvatah Pad."
God is the holder of eyes, mouth, hands and feet everywhere, meaning he is omnipresent through his body. If he is considered to have a body, then this is another contradiction.

Page #24:
---------------------------
(26.
It is said that the creation of his body is due to unseen causes, just like the bodies of ordinary beings are created by their own unseen causes (destiny, past karma), so too the body of God is created due to unseen causes. And being bodiless, he cannot create material things from nothing. Because it is seen that the effect arises according to the cause. If it is said that God has the nature to create the world, then he will never be able to rest from the work of world creation. And if he takes rest, then his nature will be harmed. If it is said that God does not have the nature to maintain the world, then God can never create the world. Creation and destruction are two different actions, and God performs both actions of creation and destruction of the world, then two natures will have to be assumed in him. Because creation and destruction are two different actions, and if both actions happen from one nature, then creation and destruction will become one, and two contradictory things cannot arise from one nature-like cause.
In addition, it is also worth considering that if the world arose from non-existence, and God also created all beings from non-existence, then all of them are mutually cooperative and exist due to the material obtained, then why is the omnipotent God considered to be the creator? When the world is self-conscious and independent of form, it is not created by anyone and evolves according to its own nature. Is there any need for God in this?
Also, to imagine a God for the salvation of the world is to make the free form of matter dependent. Every being is responsible for its own progress through its own intellect and love, not responsible to any other creator, nor does it receive the knowledge of duty and obligation from him. Therefore, the concept of God is meaningless in the world.
From the above statement, it becomes clear that God is not the cause of the conscious diversity, but the living being itself progresses on the path of development and destruction, rise and fall of its own karma. That is why Jain vision has considered karma as the cause of the diversity of the living world. This vision

Not imagined but based on real facts. The main purpose of karma theory is to explain the problem of visible inequality in the world.
The general meaning of karma is known, but when we understand its connotative meaning, it is the combination of karmic atoms that affect the soul's power due to the actions performed by the living being. This combination is called karma, and this karma is the seed of the different, diverse, and unequal states of the living beings. Through this seed, the living being acquires various types of afflictions, diseases, and limitations.
This is what the Turkish proverb says: "Karma is the master, whatever you do, you will get the same result."
As a living being acts, so it receives the fruits. There is no injustice in this. The common people believe that "karma's path does not stop." Indian thinkers have given great importance to the theory of karma. All, whether they are soul-believing Jains, Sankhya and other non-soul-believing schools, and even God-believing thinkers, have accepted the existence of karma and the fact that it brings happiness, sorrow, etc. to the living being. Due to the consequences of karma, the living being acquires various types of inequalities. As one has acted with karma, so one's destiny and outcome become. Past karma arises and according to it, new karma is bound. This cycle has been going on since time immemorial.
To clarify the meaning of karma, various philosophers have used words like Maya, Avidya, Prakriti, Apurva, Vasana, Dharma-Adharma, Adrishta, Sanskar, etc.
1 Acharanga 31

Page #26:
---------------------------
It is observed and concluded that every action and tendency of a living being creates karmas, which result in happiness or sorrow, either immediately or in the future. These karmas are the cause of the living being experiencing auspicious or inauspicious fruits. However, when the soul, through its own power, becomes free from all karmas and attains liberation, it is called liberated. In this state of liberation, karmas no longer bind with the soul and do not bear their fruits.

The peculiarity of the conscious entity cannot be explained without accepting karma. The soul, according to its past karmas, creates its own nature and circumstances, which influence external material objects and lead to their transformation. This is how karma-phala (fruits of karma) are obtained. The time of ripening of karma is determined by the time of its creation, and even during the time of its manifestation, the material elements of space, time, and emotions play a role. Therefore, the soul experiences the fruits of its karma accordingly, whether they are subtle, moderate, or gross.

The question arises: how does karma become connected with the living being, making it experience happiness, sorrow, and other forms of duality, and how does it receive the fruits of karma in this way? The answer is that even though the soul is pure and luminous, it continues to accept subtle particles (pudgalas) through its karmic-narrative self. This process of acceptance involves the participation of the mind, speech, and body. As long as the living being is attached to passions (kṣayā), it continues to bind karmas that bear fruits (vipaka-udaya). According to these bound karmas, the living being experiences auspicious or inauspicious fruits. There is no other giver or helper in this process of experiencing fruits. If someone else is considered to be a helper in receiving the fruits of karma, then the karmas created by the living being become meaningless. Furthermore, if the living being is considered to receive the fruits of karma from someone else, then the principle of self-created karma becomes invalid.

1. Good karma leads to good fruits, and bad karma leads to bad fruits.
2. Due to the presence of passions, the living being accepts karmas from the subtle particles. (Sattvārthasūtra 12)

Page #27:
---------------------------
(26)
It can be argued that this leads to a loss of the soul's effort. If the soul's attainment of fruits is dependent on others, then enthusiasm for righteous actions and detachment from actions will not arise, and no effort or endeavor will be made in this direction. The essence of the above statement is that karma is the cause of the diverse varieties visible in worldly beings, such as farmers, etc. It is due to being bound by karma that worldly beings have an infinite variety of bodies, senses, and their strengths and weaknesses. Not only this, but karma is also the cause of the differences in the development of their soul qualities.
The Marganas classify these worldly beings, who are endowed with physical, mental, and spiritual limitations due to karma, based on their limitations. Marganas are not indicators of the development of beings, but rather they provide a systematic classification of their natural forms in various ways, so that their physical capabilities and the fluidity of their soul qualities due to those capabilities can be accurately depicted.
In the Marganas, the utility of the knowledge of ownership is explained in the Karmagrantha, where the Marganas are used to show the capacity of beings for karma-bandha. The question arises: when another Karmagrantha has already described the fourteen divisions of all worldly beings according to their Gunasthanas, and has described the capacity of each division for karma-bandha, udhaya, jadaurana, and satta, and this knowledge reveals the spiritual progress and decline of all beings, then what is the utility of again explaining their capacity for bandha based on the Marganas, and is there even a need for such an effort?
The answer is that even with the same Gunasthana, beings of different species, beings with different senses, beings with different Ligas (Vedas), beings with different Kashaya results, beings with different Yogas, and beings with different types of knowledge, vision, restraint, and other soul qualities, are classified based on the Marganas to show their different capacities. This has two benefits: one is that beings with certain types of motion, etc.,...

:
How many Gunasthana can there be and secondly, even if the Gunasthana are the same, how many karmas does a being bind to its body, senses, etc.? This cannot be possible by explaining the ownership in relation to Gunasthana. Therefore, it is worth pondering for those with spiritual vision.
**Book Introduction**
There are many books that impart knowledge of sifare. Among them are six karmagranthas namely Karmavipak, Karmastav, Swamitva, Padashiti, ure and Saptatika. These are called Pramin Shat Karmagranthas. The authors are also mixed and different Acharyas and the time of composition is also different. The ancient epithet is not used with them to indicate their antiquity, but it is used to indicate their position from the new karmagranthas created on the basis of their service. Shrimaddevendra
has created five karmagranthas following the above. Their names are as follows:
But none of them
Collection of subjects also
1. Karmavipak 2. Karmaere. 3. Swamitva 4. Parsithi 5. Shatak These karmagranthas are smaller in size than the ancient karmagranthas, the subject matter has not been left out and many new ones have been added. As a result, students of karma literature have adopted these books and except for a few scholars, ordinary people do not even know that there are other ancient karmagranthas besides those of Shri Devendrasur.
The subject matter of general karmagranthas is karma siddhant. But when one is inclined to know the content of each book, it is to be known that the first karmagrantha describes the karmas like jnanaavaran, their types and their fruits. The second karmagrantha explains the nature of Gunasthana and discusses the binding, arising, excitation and maturity of karma natures in them.
:
The third karmagrantha describes the owners of the binding of karma natures with the help of margena. It describes which and how many natures a being with a particular margena binds. The fourth karmagrantha describes the jivasthana, margena sthana, guna

Page #29:
---------------------------
(31)
The text describes in detail the division of karma based on location, state, and number. The fifth chapter of the first karma text explains which of the afra karmas are dhruva, abhuva, bandha, udaya, and satta. It also explains which are sarva deshghati, apati, punya papa, parayartman, and aparavartman. Following this, it explains which karmas are kshetra, jiva bhava, and pudgala vipaki. Subsequently, the text describes the nature of karma, its state, rasa, and pradesh, along with the different types of bandha. Finally, it concludes with the path of upshama shreni and kshapaka shreni.

The third karma text focuses on the 14 marganas, including गति (motion), and their respective उत्तरभेद (subdivisions). It explains the bandha of karmas in relation to the general and specific locations. In other words, it explains how many karmas a jiva with a particular margana binds. While the text does not explicitly mention the names of the marganas and their subdivisions like गति, इन्द्रिय, काय, etc. at the beginning, it does mention their ownership, allowing the reader to easily understand the origin and subdivisions of the marganas.

The subject matter of this text and the ancient karma text is similar. However, the ancient text provides a more detailed description of the subject matter, while this text focuses on the kshetra. Nevertheless, no topic is omitted in this text. Gommata's Sar Karmakanda also describes the subject matter of this text, but its description is slightly different. It includes topics not found in the third karma text, but which are beneficial for the study of karma. The third karma text describes the bandha ownership of the marganas, while the Sar Karmakanda describes the udaya, udirana, and satta ownership in addition to bandha ownership. This description is beneficial for practitioners and is therefore included as an appendix.

Page #30:
---------------------------
It is possible that there may be some differences in the description of karma-kāṇḍa in the Karmagrantha and Gommatasāra. However, the planetary friendship will be partial and there is more similarity than difference. Therefore, from the perspective of the tattvajña, the Gommatasāra karmakāṇḍa, even though it is a small part, is useful for comparative study of the karma-sākṣya. This is the aspiration.

In this, the readers have also been given a historical introduction to various texts written on less literature so far, so that those who are curious about the subject may be attracted to the study of these texts.

The original gāthās of the first three parts have also been given so that the lovers of the Karmagrantha can memorize them and make the entire text heart-felt. Overall, the effort has been made to make it useful from all other perspectives. The evaluation is in the hands of the readers.

I bow to the valiant, the glorious Devadhari-composed Bandhaswamitva.
The third Karma-prastha, the destroyer of bondage, the luminous, the moon-like, the Jina, the destroyer of the cycle of births and deaths. I ask, in summary, about Bandhaswamitva. ||15||

**Meaning:**
This verse, composed by the great Devadhari, is dedicated to the valiant, the glorious, the moon-like, the luminous, the Jina, the destroyer of the cycle of births and deaths, the Lord Vardhamana (Vira). It is the third Karma-prastha, the destroyer of bondage. The verse asks, in summary, about Bandhaswamitva, the nature of bondage.

**Explanation:**
The author, in the beginning of the text, offers salutations to the Lord Vardhamana (Vira), who is free from the bondage of Karma, luminous like the moon, and possesses the supreme knowledge (Kevalgyan). He then briefly introduces the topic of the text, which is about Bandhaswamitva, the nature of bondage.

Bandhaswamitva refers to the relationship between the soul and Karma. This relationship is established through the causes of Karma-bandha, such as Mithyatva (false belief), etc. The text will further explain the nature of Bandhaswamitva, i.e., which soul binds which types of Karmas, in relation to the different stages of the soul's journey (Margana, Gati, etc.).

## Translation:

**2**

The term "Margana" refers to the states or conditions of a living being. It means to examine and investigate the way in which a living being is perceived, in terms of its states, transformations, etc.

**1**

There are infinite living beings in the world. Each being has a unique external and internal life. The size of the body, senses, color, appearance, intellect, mental strength, etc., differ from one being to another. This difference arises due to karma-generated states, such as Audayik, Autsargik, Kshayopaśamik, and Kshayik, and also due to inherent consequential states. These infinite differences have been categorized by the wise into 62 divisions. These divisions of the external and internal life of living beings are called Margana.

The wise have also categorized living beings into fourteen divisions based on the development of their spiritual qualities. These divisions are called Gunasthanas.

The wise consider the state of a living being with attachment and ignorance as the lowest state, and the attainment of complete knowledge without attachment, or Moksha, as the highest state. Gradually, the living being progresses by shedding the veils of attachment and develops the inherent qualities of the soul, such as knowledge, perception, and character. In this path of development, the living being passes through fourteen states. These progressive states of the path of development are called Gunasthanas. These countless progressive states have also been categorized by the wise into fourteen divisions. These fourteen divisions are called Gunasthanas in the scriptures.

The difference between Margana and Gunasthanas lies in the way they are categorized.

Page #33:
---------------------------
## The Sutra Karm Granth

The Sutra Karm Granth does not consider the ultimate nature of the states of karma, but rather examines them through the lens of physical, mental, and spiritual characteristics, as perceived by the Marganas. In contrast, the Gunasthanas provide knowledge about the tendencies and cessation of the ultimate nature and yogas of the karma patalas.

Marganas do not reveal the evolutionary path of a being, but rather differentiate their natural and inherent forms in various ways. Conversely, Gunasthanas describe the evolutionary path of a being and categorize the stages of its karmic development. Marganas are co-existent, while Gunasthanas are sequential. This means that a single being can possess fourteen Marganas, while only one Gunasthan can exist within it.

One can progress through Gunasthanas, leaving behind previous ones, and achieve spiritual growth. However, it is not possible to acquire new Marganas while retaining previous ones, nor can spiritual perfection be attained through them. A being who has attained the thirteenth Gunasthan, the Kevalasthan, possesses all Marganas except the Kashaya Margana. However, there is only one thirteenth Gunasthan. Even in the final stage of a being, the Pat, all Marganas except three or four remain, while there is only one fourteenth Gunasthan in the Gunasthanas.

Thus, there is a distinct difference between Marganas and Gunasthanas. The Gunasthanas have been discussed in another Karm Granth. Here, we focus on understanding the karmic bondage and ownership of a being through the Marganas.

Just as there are fourteen Gunasthanas, each with its own name like Mithyatva, Sasvadan, etc., there are also fourteen Marganas, with names as follows:

## Third Karma Granth

This also includes the **Karma Granth**. Why are they called **Jnana Margana** and **Samyama Margana**?

**Answer:**

Each **Margana** is named based on its primary characteristics. The primary characteristics are **vare** and the opposing characteristics are secondary. For example, in a forest, Neem trees are in a smaller number and Mango trees are in a larger number, so it is called a Mango forest. Similarly, in **Jnana Margana**, **Mati**, **Shruta**, **Avadhi**, **Man:paryaya**, and **Keval Jnana** are the five main types of knowledge, while **Mati Ajnan**, **Shruta Ajnan**, and **Vibhang Jnana** are secondary. In **Samyama Margana**, **Samayik** etc. up to **Yayakhyat Paryant** are the main types, and **Asamyama**, the opposite of **Samyama**, is secondary. Therefore, due to the prominence of **Mati** etc. knowledge and **Samayik** etc. **Samyama**, they are respectively named **Jnana Margana** and **Samyama Margana**.

In **Margana**, generally, and in relation to **Gunasthanas**, the statement of **Bandh** ownership is made. Generally, the **Gunasthanas** in **Margana** are as follows:

**Gati:** In **Tiyancha Gati**, there are five **Gunasthanas** from the beginning, in **Dev** and **Naraka Gati**, there are four **Gunasthanas** from the beginning, and in **Manushya Gati**, there are all fourteen **Gunasthanas** from the beginning with **Mithyatva** to **Ayogikevali**.

**Indriya:** In **Ekendriya**, **Dwiindriya**, **Triindriya**, and **Chaturindriya**, there are two **Gunasthanas**, the first and the second. In **Panchendriya**, there are all **Gunasthanas**.

**Kay:** In **Prithvi**, **Jal**, and **Vanaspati Kay**, there are two **Gunasthanas**, the first and the second. In **Tejas Kay** and **Vayu Kay**, there is one **Gunasthan**, the first. In **Us Kay**, there are all **Gunasthanas**.

**Yog:** There are thirteen **Gunasthanas** from the first to the thirteenth (**Sayogikevali**).

**Ved:** In **Vedatrik**, there are nine **Gunasthanas** from the beginning (in relation to **Sadaya**).

---------------------------
## Third Kamprath

**Dietary beings** have thirteen Gunasthanas, starting from Mithyatva and ending with the thirteenth Sayogikevali. **Non-dietary beings** have five Gunasthanas: the first, tenth, fourth, thirteenth, and twenty-fourth.

After explaining the characteristics of the Marganas and their sub-categories, the following two verses indicate a collection of certain natures that help in explaining the ability of Jivas to bind karma according to their respective natures.

**Verse 26:** Jin, Suravidvahar, Vaikriya, Aharak, Vayu, Narakatik, Sukshmatrik, Vikalnik, Ekendriya, Stavar, Atap, Napusak, Mithyatva, Hun, Mevat, Anantanubandhi Chatushk, Madhyam Sansthan Chatushk, Madhyam Sanhanan Chatushk, Ashubhavihayogati, Nich Gotra, Strived, Dubhang Trik, Styanaddhi Trik, Udyot, Tiyanch, Tiyanchay, Manusmayu, Manusya, Audarik, and Vrishabhanara are the 55 natures that help in explaining the bondage of Jivas.

**Verse 3:** An Majmagidd, Sandhayan, Kukhag, Liy, Iyi, Duhayog, Usloyatiri, Dugam, Tiri, Narau, Nar, Ur, Lagarisah.

**Explanation:** These 55 natures are listed in order because they are helpful in explaining the bondage of Jivas.

**Special Note:** There are 120 bondable natures. Of these, the 55 mentioned above are specifically used in this Karmagranth for reference. In other words, these two verses provide a concise summary of 55 natures to avoid repeatedly mentioning them in the following verses. For example, the term "Suragunadhis" should be understood to include the 16 natures from Devadhik onwards.

Thus, in brief, to indicate the nature of the karmas that bind, the collection of karmas is explained. In the next four gathas, the bondage-ownership of the hell-gati is explained in the fourteen marganas, through the distinction of the gati-marg-bha.

**Gatha-arth:** ... Of the 120 karmas that bind, except for the nineteen karmas like Surakshik, one hundred and one karmas bind the narak-jiva in general. The narak-jiva who is in the Mithyatva-gunasthan, binds one hundred karmas without the Tirth-dur karma. And the narak-jiva who is in the Sasvadan-gunasthan, binds sixty-nine karmas except for the four napunsak. In the Tri-rth-gatha, the karmas that bind in the hell-gati in general (O) and specifically in the Mithyatva-gunasthan and the Sasvadan-gunasthan are explained.

1. **Ogh-bandh:** The bondage of all narak-jiva, without any specific intention towards any particular gunasthan or khaam, is called their Ogh-bandh or general bondage.
2. **Vishesh-bandh:** The bondage of the narak-jiva, with specific intention towards a particular gunasthan or a particular khaam hell, is called their Vishesh-bandh. For example, the narak-jiva who is in the Mithyatva-gunasthan binds one hundred karmas, etc. Similarly, in the other marganas, the meaning of Ogh-bandh and Vishesh-bandh is explained.

Page #44:
---------------------------
## Ownership

**Nārakas** are those who are born in the hellish realm due to the arising of the karma of hellish existence, or those who cause suffering to human beings. Alternatively, they are those who, due to the field of substance, time, and emotion, do not attain love for themselves or others. Nārakas constantly suffer from natural, physical, mental, and other types of pain.

**Generally, 20 natures are considered to be capable of binding for living beings.** Out of these, 55 natures are mentioned in the previous two verses. From the collection of these 55 natures, starting with Devadvika, etc., the 16 natures mentioned in sequence are not capable of binding in the hellish realm. Therefore, generally, 101 natures are considered to be capable of binding. In other words, in the verse where the term "Surarāṇī" appears, the following 19 natures are not capable of binding due to the nature of the hellish beings' existence: (1) Devagati, (2) Ānu-pūrva, (3) Vaikriya-śarīra, (4) Chaikriya-ango-pānga, (5) Āhārak-śarīra, (6) Āhārak-ango-pānga, (7) Devāyu, (8) Narakagati, (9) Narak-ānu-pūrva, (10) Narakāyu, (11) Sūkṣma-nāma, (12) Aparyāpta-nāma, (13) Sādhāraṇa-nāma, (14) Dvīndriya-jāti, (15) Trīndriya-jāti, (16) Chaturindriya-jāti, (17) Ekendriya-jāti, (18) Sthāvara-nāma, and (19) Ātapa-nāma. Therefore, out of the 120 eligible natures, these 19 natures should be subtracted, leaving 101 natures that are generally considered to be capable of binding in the hellish realm.

Because the places where these 19 natures arise are not places where hellish beings can be born after leaving the hellish realm, they are not capable of binding.

1. (a) When the motion of the body is due to the effort of the soul, then it is called "Bhārakā".
(b) The eternal, auspicious, and pleasant results are called "Devāvikriyā".

*Go. Jīvakāṇḍa 146*

---------------------------
The third Karma Grantha are: Devagati, Devanupurvi, Baintriya Sharira, Vaikriya Agopaang, Devayu, Narakagati, Marakanapurvi and Narakayu. These eight Prakruti are Dev and Narakiya-prayogya and Narak जीव do not get born in Narak or Dev गति after death. Therefore, these eight Prakruti do not bind in Narakagati.

The three Prakruti, Sukshma Naam, Apariapt Naam and Sadharan Naam, are also not bound by Narak जीव. Because the rise of Sukshma Naamkarma is from Sukshma Ekendriya, the rise of Apariapt Naamkarma is from Apariapt Tiryanch and Manusya, and the rise of Sadharan Naamkarma is from Sadharan Vanrupati.

Similarly, the three Prakruti, Ekendriya Jaati, Sthavar Naam and Atap Naam, are Ekendriya-prayogya and Vikalendriya are Vikalendriya-prayogya. Therefore, these six Prakruti are not bound by Narak जीव. And the rise of Aharak Drik is only for Charitrasampanna Labdhidhari Muni, not for others. Therefore, from Devadrik to Atap Naamkarma, 16 Prakruti are not bound, and in Narakagati, 101 Prakruti are bound in general.

Although 101 Prakruti are bound in Narakagati in general, Narak जीव have four Gunasthan from Mithyatva Gunasthan to Chaude Avirat Samyagdristi Gunasthan. Therefore, 100 Prakruti are bound in Mithyatva Gunasthan because Tirthankar Naamkarma is not bound. Because the one who is eligible for the binding of Tirthankar Naamkarma is Samyaktvi, i.e., the binding of Tirthankar Naamkarma can only happen if one is Samyaktvi. But there is no Samyaktvi in Mithyatva Gunasthan, therefore, Tirthankar Naamkarma is not bound for Narak जीव in Mithyatva Gunasthan. Therefore, 100 Prakruti are bound for Narak जीव in Mithyatva Gunasthan.

Secondly, Narak जीव in Sastrain Gunasthan, Napusakaved, Mithyatva...

Page #46:
---------------------------
Yasvamiśtra, Mohaniya, Haṇḍa-sthāna and Sevāt-saṁhanana - these four Prakṛtis are not bound. Because the binding of these four Prakṛtis occurs during the time of Mithyātva's arising. But at the time of Sāsvādana, Mithyātva does not arise. That is, Naraka-trika, Jāri-catuṣka, sthāvara-catuṣka, Haṇḍa-sthāna, Ātapa-nāma, Mevāt-saṁhanana, Napuṣaka-veda and Mithyātva-mohaniya - these sixteen Prakṛtis are bound due to Mithyātva. Out of these, Naraka-trika, Sūkṣma-trika, Vikala-trika, Eka-indriya-jāti, sthāvara-nāma and Ātapa-nāma - these twelve Prakṛtis are not bound by the Nārakīya Jīvas due to their different nature. Therefore, by taking them in Deva-dvīka etc., these twelve Prakṛtis are reduced at the time of general binding. And the remaining Napuṣaka-veda, Mithyātva-mohaniya, Haṇḍa-sthāna and Mevāt-saṁhanana - these Prakṛtis are bound due to Mithyātva, and Mithyātva does not arise in the Sāsvādana Guṇasthāna. Therefore, in the Sāsvādana Guṇasthāna, by reducing these four Prakṛtis from the 100 Prakṛtis that are bound by the Māraka Jīvas residing in the Mithyātva Guṇasthāna, the 66 Prakṛtis of the other Nārakīya Jīvas residing in the Sāsvādana Guṇasthāna are not eligible for binding. 

The summary is that out of the 120 Prakṛtis that are eligible for binding, in the Naraka-gati, compared to the general binding, 101 Prakṛtis are bound because 16 Prakṛtis are not eligible for binding from the Ātāpa-nāmakarma up to the Sura-dvīka etc. 

In the Naraka-gati, there are four Guṇasthānas from the first to the ninth. Therefore, out of the 101 Prakṛtis that are eligible for binding in the Naraka-gati, the binding of the Tīrthaṅkara Nāmakarma is due to Samyaktva, and since the Tīrthaṅkara Nāmakarma is not bound by the Nārakīya Jīvas residing in the Mithyātva Guṇasthāna, 100 Prakṛtis are bound, and the binding of the four Prakṛtis like Napuṣaka-veda etc. occurs when Mithyātva arises. And since Mithyātva does not arise in the Sāsvādana Guṇasthāna, by reducing the four Prakṛtis like Napuṣaka-veda etc. from the 100 Prakṛtis that are eligible for binding in the Mithyātva Guṇasthāna, 66 Prakṛtis are bound.

## Third Karma-Pranya
27
Having described the bondage of karma-prakritis in the hell-realm, in the first and second guna-sthana, and of the hell-beings, we now proceed to describe the bondage of karma-prakritis in the third and fourth guna-sthana, and of the hell-beings in the Ratna-prabha and other realms, in the following verse:

5
**Verse Meaning:** In the mixed guna-sthana, there is bondage of seventy karma-prakritis, excluding the twenty-six prakritis of the Ananta-anubandhi Chatushk, etc. Adding the Tirthankara name and human lifespan to these, there is bondage of seventy-two prakritis in the Samyak-tva guna-sthana. Similarly, this general method of bondage in the hell-realm should be understood in the four guna-sthana of the hell-beings in the three hell-realms of Ratna-prabha, etc. And in the Panka-prabha and other hells, the remaining general method of bondage, excluding the Tirthankara name-karma, should be understood as before.

**Special Meaning:** After describing the bondage of karma-prakritis in the first and second guna-sthana in the hell-realm, this verse describes the bondage of karma-prakritis in the third and fourth guna-sthana, and of the hell-beings in the six hell-realms of Ratna-prabha, etc.

The hell-beings in the mixed guna-sthana have bondage of 70 karma-prakritis. Because the Ananta-anubandhi Chatushk, Madhyama Sansthana Chatushk, Madhyama Sanhanan Chatushk, Ashubha Vihayoga-ti, Nica-gotra, Stri-veda, Dur-bhag, Duh-svara, Anadeya Sthan-trik, Udyota, and Niyantrik, these 25 prakritis do not have bondage in the mixed guna-sthana due to the absence of the arising of Ananta-anubandhi. The arising of Ananta-anubandhi kshaya occurs until the first and second guna-sthana, not in the third and subsequent guna-sthana. At the end of the second guna-sthana, the Ananta-anubandhi kshaya is disjoined or destroyed.

Page #48:
---------------------------
##  Bandhasvamitva

Therefore, the bondage of the aforementioned 25  **Prakritis** which bind the **Anantanu bandhi** does not occur in the third **Gunasthan** (state of virtue). And no being residing in the **Mishra Gunasthan** (mixed state of virtue) performs the bondage of **Ayukarma** (life-span karma). Therefore, **Manushyayu** (human life-span) cannot occur. 

Hence, from the 96 **Prakritis** that bind the **Naraka** (hell) beings residing in the second **Gunasthan**, the aforementioned 25 **Prakritis** like **Anantanu bandhi** **Kshaya Chatushk** (fourfold passions) and **Manushyayu**, totaling 26 **Prakritis**, should be deducted. This leaves 70 **Prakritis** for the **Naraka** beings residing in the **Mishra Gunasthan**.

However, the **Naraka** beings residing in the fourth **Gunasthan** (state of perfect vision) called **Avirat Samyagdrishti**, due to their **Samyaktva** (right faith), can perform the bondage of **Tirthankara Namakarma** (karma that leads to becoming a Tirthankara). This is because the bondage of **Tirthankara Namakarma** occurs only in the presence of **Samyaktva**. And due to the rule that **Ayukarma** does not bind beings residing in the **Mishra Gunasthan**, the **Manushyayu** that was not bound in the **Mishra Gunasthan** gets bound in the fourth **Gunasthan**. This adds two **Prakritis** - **Tirthankara Namakarma** and **Manushyayu** - to the 70 **Prakritis** that bind beings in the **Mishra Gunasthan**. Therefore, the **Naraka** beings residing in the fourth **Gunasthan** bind 72 **Prakritis**.

The reason why the **Naraka** beings residing in the fourth **Gunasthan** do not bind **Manushyayu** is that they cannot bind the life-span of **Naraka** again, nor can they bind the life-span of **Deva** (heaven). Therefore, these two **Ayukarma** **Prakritis** are not bound in **Naraka**. This has been indicated in the fourth **Gatha** (verse) before the phrase "**Surugunnisav**". The bondage of **Linyachayu** (life-span of a specific type of hell) occurs when **Anantanu bandhi** **Kshaya** arises. And the arising of **Anantanu bandhi** **Kshaya** occurs in the first and second **Gunasthan**.

1. (a) **Sammāmichhaddiṭṭī āuyadha pi na karei ti**. (b) **Missūṇe āisam**....!

- **O Karmakanda** 11

Page #49:
---------------------------
## Sutra Karma Granth 16

This is only the case in the lower four Gunasthanas, not in the higher ones. Therefore, in the fourth Gunasthana, there cannot be any binding of Tiryanchayu for the Naraka beings. Thus, since there is no binding of Naraka, Deva, and Tiryanchayu, only Manushyayu remains. And, since the principle of non-binding of the Parbhava-related Ayus in the third Misra Gunasthana is established, the Naraka beings in the fourth Gunasthana can bind Manushyayu.

In this way, after explaining the binding ownership in relation to the Gunasthanas in the Naraka Gati, we now explain the binding ownership of the Narakas residing in the Naraka Bhumi.

Ratna Prabha, Sharkara Prabha, Valuka Prabha, Pank Prabha, Dhum Prabha, Tamah Prabha, and Maha Tamah Prabha - these are the seven Naraka Bhumi. These Bhumi are situated on Ghanaambu, Vata, and Akasha. They are situated one below the other, with the lower ones being more extensive.

In these seven Narakas, the binding ownership of the Naraka beings in Ratna Prabha, Sharkara Prabha, and Valuka Prabha should be considered the same as the binding ownership mentioned in relation to the four Gunasthanas in general. That is, just as in the Naraka Gati, the binding of 100, 66, 70, and 72 Prakruti is considered in the first, second, third, and fourth Gunasthanas respectively, similarly, the binding ownership of the Karma Prakruti in their respective Gunasthanas should be understood for the Naraka beings residing in Ratna Prabha, Sharkara Prabha, and Valuka Prabha.

Although the plural word 'Raisu' in the verse should have included all seven Narakas, including Ratna Prabha, etc., the reason for including only the first, second, and third Narakas here is:

1. Ratna Sharkara Baluka Pank Dhum Tamo Maha Tamo Prabha Bhumiyo Ghanaambu Vata Akasha Pratiṣṭhāḥ Sapta Adho Adha Prithutarāḥ.
- Sava 331

Page #50:
---------------------------
## Bandhaswamitva

This is because the term 'Pankais' is used in this very verse, which means that the Bandhaswamitva of Pankaprabha and other Narakas will be discussed separately. For this reason, the three Narakas of Raprabha, Sharkaraprabha, and Balkaaprabha, which come before the fourth Naraka called Pankaprabha, have been taken here. And the term 'Kasu' should be used to include the remaining Narakas starting from Pankaprabha. But the term 'Pankais' is used to include the three Narakas of Pankaprabha, Dhumpapraba, and Tamapraba, because the Bandhaswamitva of the seventh Naraka called Mahatamahpraba is mentioned separately in the next verse. This verse is meant to convey that the Naraka beings from Pankaprabha to Mahatamahpraba do not have the Bandhaswamitva of Tirthankaranamkarma. The term 'Pankais' is used to convey this.

The Tirthanamkarma does not have Bandhaswamitva in the Narakas of Pamp, etc., Pausal, and the sixth Naraka called Maun.

The reason why the Tirthankaranamkarma does not have Bandhaswamitva in Pankaprabha, etc., is that even after attaining Samyaktva in the Narakas of Pankaprabha, Dhumpapraba, and Tamapraba, the Tirthankaranamkarma does not have Bandhaswamitva due to the influence of the Kshetra and the lack of Adhyavasaya of the Lata type. Because the scriptures say that a being who comes to the first Naraka can become a Chakravarti. A being who comes to the second Naraka can become a Vasudeva. And a being who comes to the third Naraka can become a Tirthankara. A being who comes to the fourth Naraka can become a Kevali. A being who comes to the fifth Naraka can become a Sadhu. A being who comes to the sixth Naraka can become a Deshavirat. And a being who comes to the seventh Naraka can attain Samyaktva but cannot attain Deshavirattva. Therefore, a Naraka being who comes from Pankaprabha, etc., does not attain Tirthankaratva. Therefore, the Tirthankaranamkarma is considered to be Avandhya in the three Narakas of Pankaprabha, etc., and the Bandha of 100 Prakrutis should be understood.

Page #51:
---------------------------
## Third Karma Text

In the three hells of Pankaprabha, etc., in the first Gunasthan, there are 100 types of karma bound, both generally and specifically. In the second and third Gunasthan, there are 66 and 70 types of karma bound respectively, similar to the three hells of Ratnaprabha, etc. In the fourth Gunasthan, even after attaining Samyaktva, due to the influence of the field and the absence of asaara of that type, there can be a binding of 71 types of karma, as the Tirthankara-nama karma is not bound.

**Summary:** In the hell realm, there are 70 types of karma bound in the third Gunasthan and 72 in the fourth Gunasthan. This binding should be understood in the same way as the binding mentioned in relation to the Gunasthanas, even in the three hells of Ratnaprabha, etc. However, in the three hells of Pankaprabha, etc., where the Tirthankara-nama karma is not bound, there are 100 types of karma bound in the first Gunasthan, 66 in the second, 70 in the third, and 71 in the fourth, both generally and specifically.

After describing the ownership of beings in the hell realm from the first to the sixth hell, the next two verses describe the ownership of the seventh hell and the Tirthankara-nama karma in the Tiryancha realm.

**Verse 6:** In the seventh hell, the Tirthankara-nama karma and the Manushyasu karma are generally not bound. The remaining types of karma are bound in the Mithyatva Gunasthan, without the Manushyadvik and the higher gotra.

**Verse 7:** In the Sasvadana Gunasthan, 61 types of karma are bound, without the Tiryanchayu and the Napumsakchatushk. These 91 types of karma...

Page #52:
---------------------------
##  BandhasvAmitva

In the **SadhasvAmitva**, from the infinite **AnantAnubandhi Adi Chatushk** 24 **Prakritis**, by reducing the **Prakritis** and combining the three **Prakritis** of **Manushyadik** and **Uchchamotr**, there are 7 **Prakritis** bound in the **Mishradvik Gunasthan**. In **TiryanchGati**, the **Tiryach TIrthankarNamakarma** and **AharakDvik Meshin** bind 117 **Prakritis** in the **Samaanya** and **Gunasthan**.

Specifically, in these two verses, the **BandhasvAmitva** of the **Samaanya** and **Gunasthan** in the **Narakas** of the seventh hell, and the **Tiryach** in **TiryanchGati**, is described.

In the **Samaanya** of **NarakGati**, 101 **Prakritis** are capable of being bound. Due to the influence of **Kshetragat**, the **TirthankarNamakarma** is not bound in the **Narakas** of the seventh hell, as there is a lack of **Adhyavasaya** of that type. Also, **Manushyaayu** can only be bound up to the sixth hell. The **Manushyaayu** is a superior **Punyakriti** compared to the seventh hell. Therefore, its binding can only occur with superior **Adhyavasaya**. Hence, the **Narakas** of the seventh hell do not bind **Manushyaayu**.

Thus, from the 101 **Prakritis** capable of being bound in the **Samaanya** of **NarakGati**, by reducing the two **Prakritis** of **TirthankarNamakarma** and **Manushyaayu**, 66 **Prakritis** are considered bound in the seventh hell.

Among the **Prakritis** that are capable of being bound in the seventh hell, the **Narakas** of the first **Mithyatva Gunasthan** in that hell, namely **Manushyadik**, **ManushyaGati**, and **ManushyaAnupurvi**, and **UchchaGotr**, do not bind these three **Prakritis** due to the lack of **Tathavid Vishuddhi**. Because the seventh hell...

## Third Karma Granth

For the inhabitants of the seventh hell, these three karmic natures are considered excellent and virtuous: **Manushya Gati**, **Manushyanupurvi**, and **Uchcha Gotra**. These are bound by **Utkrishta Vishuddha Madhyavasaya** and their **Adhyavasaya** is in the **seventh hell**, in the **third and fourth Gunasthanas**. 

Therefore, since these three karmic natures are considered **Avandhya** (not subject to binding), out of the 66 karmic natures that are generally subject to binding, these three are reduced. This leaves 63 karmic natures that are considered bound for the inhabitants of the seventh hell in the **Mithyatva Gunasthan**.

In the **Sasvadan Gunasthan** of the seventh hell, five karmic natures are considered **Avandhya**: **Tiryach-ayu**, **Napunsak Chatushk** (Napunsak Ved, Mithyatva, Hund Sansthan, and Sewart Sanhanan). Therefore, out of the 66 karmic natures that are generally subject to binding, these five are reduced, leaving 61 karmic natures bound in the **Mithyatva Gunasthan**.

This is because in this Gunasthan, **Yogya Adhyavasaya** (proper determination) is absent, so **Tiryach-ayu** is not bound. Also, **Napunsak Chatushk** arises from **Mithyatva**, but **Mithyatva** does not arise in the **Sasvadan Gunasthan**. Therefore, **Napunsak Chatushk** is not bound.

Thus, by reducing these five karmic natures from the 66, the inhabitants of the seventh hell in the **Sasvadan Gunasthan** are bound by 61 karmic natures.

## HIINON 25

Out of the 61 karmic natures that are considered bound for the inhabitants of the seventh hell in the **Sasvadan Gunasthan**, 24 karmic natures are considered **Ananta Anubandhi Chatushk** and **Tiryadvik Paryant**. These include:

* **Ananta Anubandhi** (Infinitely Bound): Krodha (Anger), Mana (Pride), Maya (Delusion), Lobha (Greed)
* **Nyagrodha Parimandal**
* **Sadi Vaman Kubj Sansthan**
* **Rishabhanaraach Naraach Ardha Naraach Kilika Sanhanan**
* **Ashubha Vihayogati**
* **Neecha Gotra**
* **Stri Ved**
* **Dubhang**
* **Duhswar**
* **Anadeya**
* **Nidra Nidra**
* **Prachala Prachala**
* **Styan Di Udyot**
* **Tiryach Gati**
* **Tiryach Anupurvi**

**Note:** The text also includes a verse in Prakrit, which translates to:

"In the seventh hell, the binding of **Mithyatva** (false belief) is strong. The **Sasvadan** (enjoyment) of the **Mithyatva** is the cause of the **Manushya Gati** (human birth)."

## Bandhaswamitva

The bondage of the 24 **Prakritis** occurs with the arising of **Kshaya** that is **Anantanu bandhi** (infinitely binding). The arising of **Anantanu bandhi** **Kshaya** occurs until the first and second **Gunasthanas**. Therefore, after reducing these 24 **Prakritis** from the aforementioned 61 **Prakritis**, 67 **Prakritis** remain. By combining these three **Prakritis** - **Manushyadvik**, **Manushya** **Gati**, and **Uchchamotr**, the bondage of 70 **Prakritis** occurs for the **Narakas** of the third **Mishra Gunasthan** and the fourth **Avirat Samyag Dristi Gunasthan** in the **Salve Naraka**.

The **Narakas** of the **Purva-Purva Naraka** have a very low **Amvasya** (dark fortnight) **Jhudhi** (understanding) compared to the **Narakas** of the **Uttara-32 Naraka**. The **Bandhak Parinam** (binding results) of **Punyaprakritis** become progressively less from **Purva-Purva Naraka** to **Uttara-Uttara Naraka**. Although a **Jiva** can bind **Mati** (mind) at any time until the sixth part of the eighth **Gunasthan**, the **Adhyavasaya** (determination) suitable for **Naraka Gati** (hellish state) is until the first **Gunasthan**, for **Tiryanch Gati** (animal state) until the second **Gunasthan**, for **Dev Gati** (heavenly state) until the sixth part of the eighth **Gunasthan**, and for **Manushya Gati** (human state) until the fourth **Gunasthan**. **Naraka Jivas** cannot bind **Naraka** and **Dev Gati**. Therefore, in the third and fourth **Gunasthanas**, the **Narakas** of the seventh **Naraka** can bind **Manushya Gati**. However, these **Jivas** bind **Ayushya** (lifespan) only in the first **Gunasthan**. They do not bind in other **Gunasthanas** due to the lack of **Adhyavasaya** suitable for **Yoga**. In the first and fourth **Gunasthanas**, the **Manushya Mati** (human mind) **Prayogya Bandha** (binding suitable for human state) does not occur for the **Jivas** of the seventh **Naraka** due to the lack of **Laycha Parinam** (result of binding).

The **Punyaprakritis** that are bound by the **Mithyastri Narakas** of the first **Naraka** in the form of **Manushyadvik** and **Uchchagotr** cannot be bound in the seventh **Naraka** except in the third and fourth **Gunasthanas**. The **Utkrishta Vishuddha Parinam** (excellent pure results) in the seventh **Naraka** are the ones that bind the aforementioned three **Prakritis**.

The third chapter can be considered. Therefore, the three mentioned are the most excellent Marīs in the seventh hell.
Although a human being arises in many births, the beings of the seventh hell do not bind the human lifespan. However, in the absence of it, they bind the human lifespan in the third and fourth stages of the qualities. This means that the human lifespan is not bound with the human lifespan. The binding of the water lifespan should be accompanied by the binding of the karma of intellect and replenishment, there is no such rule. The human lifespan can also be bound in the third and fourth stages of the qualities, and it arises in many births.
Thus, after stating the ownership of the binding of the hellish path, now we explain the ownership of the binding of the animal path.
Those who have the karma of the animal path arising are carried by the animal path.
There are two types of animals: sufficient animals and insufficient animals. Of these two, here we explain the ownership of the binding of sufficient animals.
Out of the 120 natures that are generally bindable in relation to all beings, the karma of the Tirthankara and the food-related karma, these two natures are not bound in the Tirthankara path. Therefore, there is a binding of 117 natures of sufficient animals from the general. Because even when animals become enlightened, there is a lack of the necessary conditions for the binding of the karma of the Tirthankara in their birth-nature, and the food-related karma - the food-related body, the food-related limbs - is bound only to those who have adopted conduct. But animals are not entitled to conduct.
1. The binding of the food-related karma is not bound with the human lifespan, just as the wind is bound, so too is the karma of intellect and replenishment. Even if it is bound, it is bound with the water lifespan.

## 26

**Swami,**

Therefore, the three karmas mentioned in the general bondage of the Tiryancha (animal) realm are not counted. Hence, the Tiryancha realm is considered to have 117 karmas in bondage, excluding the general ones.

The Tiryancha realm has five Gunasthanas (stages of spiritual progress) from Mithyatva (false belief) to the fifth, Deshvirat (free from attachment to the world). These five Gunasthanas belong to the Paryapta Tiryancha (those who have attained the full potential of the Tiryancha realm), while only the first Gunasthan, Mithyatva, belongs to the Aparyapta Tiryancha (those who have not attained the full potential).

Just as the Paryapta Tiryancha are said to have 117 karmas in bondage, excluding the general ones, the same should be understood for the first Gunasthan, Mithyatva. As we have already explained, the Tirthankara karma is bound when one attains Samyaktv (right faith), and the Aharakarma is bound by those who practice Charitra (right conduct). However, in the Mithyatva Gunasthan, there is neither Samyaktv nor Charitra. Therefore, the Paryapta Tiryancha bind 117 karmas in the Mithyatva Gunasthan.

In summary, the Narakas (hell beings) in the seventh Naraka, who bind 91 karmas in the second Gunasthan, have 24 karmas less, including Anantanubandhi Chatushk and other Tiryancha karmas. The remaining 67 karmas, along with the three karmas of Manushya Dwik and Uchcha Gotra, are bound in the third, Mishra (mixed), and the fourth, Botha Avirat Samyagdristi Gunasthanas.

The Paryapta Tiryancha, in the Tiryancha realm, cannot bind the Tirthankara karma and Aharakarma due to the absence of the necessary Adhyavasayas (resolutions) from the 120 karmas that are eligible for bondage. Therefore, they bind 117 karmas, excluding the general ones and the first Gunasthan.

Thus, in the Naraka realm, compared to the general and Gunasthanas, there are...

## Third Karma Granth

After stating the general binding of Paryapta Tiryach in the Tiryach Gati and the binding of Swamitva in relation to the first Mithyatva Gunasthan, the following verse explains the Swamitva in each Gunasthan from the second to the fifth:

**Verse 8:**

* **fer Narayaso Sasani Surau An Egatis Vishnu Mile. Sasuraj Sarvar Samme Moyakasae Vina Vese.**

**Meaning of the Verse:**

In the Sasvadan Gunasthan, the Paryapta Tiryach bind 101 of the 117 total Paryapta Tiryach, excluding the 16 Prakruti of Narak Trik, Narak Gati, Narak Anupurvi, Narak Ayu, Jati Chatushk (Ekendirya, Dwiendriya, Triendriya, Chaturindriya), Sthavar Chatushk, Sthavar Naam, Sukshma Naam, Aparyapt Naam, Sadharan Naam, Hund Sansthan, Sewale Sanhanan, Atap Naam, Napunsak Ved, and frerraratata. In the Mishr Gunasthan, they bind 31 Prakruti, excluding the Devayuk and Ananta Anubandhi Chatushk. In the Samyaktva Gunasthan, they bind 70 Prakruti, including the tary. In the Deshvirat Gunasthan, they bind without the second Kashay.

**Special Meaning:**

After explaining the general binding of Paryapta Tiryach and their Swamitva in the Mithyatva Gunasthan, this verse explains the binding of Karma from the second to the fifth Gunasthan.

**Explanation:**

The Paryapta Tiryach bind 117 Prakruti in general and in the first Mithyatva Gunasthan. Of these, the Prakruti that bind due to the rise of Mithyatva do not bind in the Sasvadan Gunasthan because Mithyatva does not rise there. Therefore, the binding of the 16 Prakruti of Narak Trik, Narak Gati, Narak Anupurvi, Narak Ayu, Jati Chatushk (Ekendirya, Dwiendriya, Triendriya, Chaturindriya), Sthavar Chatushk, Sthavar Naam, Sukshma Naam, Aparyapt Naam, Sadharan Naam, Hund Sansthan, Sewale Sanhanan, Atap Naam, Napunsak Ved, and frerraratata does not occur, resulting in the binding of 101 Prakruti.

## Bandhasvamitva

The 501 types of bondage mentioned in the second Gunasthan of Paryaptatiryanch, are not bound in the Mishragunasthan of Paryaptaliyach due to the absence of Sadhyogya Abhyanasaya and the absence of Aayu Bandha in the Mishragunasthan. Therefore, the Devayau and Anantanubandhi Kashaya arise only up to the second Gunasthan. Consequently, the following 25 types of bondage do not occur due to them:

* **Niryantrik:** Tiryanchgathi, Tiryanchanupurvi, Tiryanchayu, Styanaddhatrik, Nidra-Nidra, Prathela-Prachala, Styanaddhi;
* **Dur Bhaghatrik:** Dubhang, Duhswar, Anadayanam;
* **Anantanubandhi Kashayachaturk:** Anantanubandhi Krodha, Mana, Maya, Lobha;
* **Madhyamasansthanchaturk:** Nyagrodha Parimandal Sansthan, Sadi Sansthan, Vaman Sansthan, Kubja Sansthan;
* **Madhyama Mahananchaturk:** Rishabhanaracha Sanhan, Maracha Tahman, Ardhanaracha Sanhan, Kilika Sanhanan;
* **Nichegotra, Udyotanam, Ashubha Vihayogathi, and Strived.**

Furthermore, the following six types of bondage do not occur due to their suitability for Manushya Gathi:

* **Manushyatrik:** Manushya Gathi, Manudhyanapurvi, Manushyayu;
* **Audarikaddhik:** Audarik Sharira, Audarik Angopang;
* **Vanrishabhanaracha Sanhanan.**

Similar to the fourth Gunasthan, in the third Gunasthan, both Paryaptamanshya and Tiryanch bind the types suitable for Devagathi, but not the types suitable for Manushya Gathi.

Therefore, in the third Mishragunasthan, the 25 types of bondage due to Devayau and Anantanubandhi Kashaya of Paryaptatiryanch, and the six types suitable for Manushya Gathi, do not occur. This results in a total of 32 types of bondage not occurring, which when subtracted from the 101 types of bondage in the second Gunasthan, leaves 66 types of bondage remaining.

## Third Karma Granth, Chapter 26

In the fourth **Avirat Samyagdrishti** Gunasthan of the **Paryapt Tiryanch**, it is known that **Devaayu** can be bound along with the 66 **Bandhyogya** (bindable) **Prakritis** of the **Mishra Gunasthan**. This is because in the third Gunasthan, there is no rule for the binding of **Aayu** (lifespan), so **Ayukarma** (lifespan karma) is not bound. However, in the fourth Gunasthan, the binding of **Aayu** related to the **Parbhaav** (previous life) is possible. But, both the **Paryapt Tiryanch** and humans in the fourth Gunasthan are eligible for **Devagati** (heavenly path), and they do not bind the **Prakritis** eligible for **Manushya Gati** (human path). Therefore, the binding of **Devaayu** in the fourth Gunasthan for **Paryapt Tiryanch** can be considered.

Thus, by adding the **Devaayu** **Prakriti** to the 66 **Bandhyogya** **Prakritis** of the third Gunasthan, the binding of 70 **Prakritis** occurs in the fourth **Avirat Samyagdrishti** Gunasthan of the **Paryapt Tiryanch**.

In the fourth **Deshavirat** Gunasthan, out of the aforementioned 70 **Prakritis**, the binding of 66 **Prakritis** occurs after reducing the four **Apratyaakhyanaavaran** **Kshaya Chatushk** - **Krodh** (anger), **Maan** (pride), **Maya** (delusion), and **Lobh** (greed). The binding of **Apratyaakhyanaavaran** **Kshaya Chatushk** does not occur in the fifth and subsequent Gunasthanas. This is because the **Yathayogya** (appropriate) **Kshaya** is the cause of the **Atyayogya** (inappropriate) **Kshaya** binding. However, in the fifth Gunasthan, the **Apratyaakhyanaavaran** **Kshaya Chatushk** does not arise, therefore, their binding cannot occur here. Their arising occurs from the first to the fourth Gunasthan, hence, their binding also occurs until here. Therefore, the binding of 66 **Prakritis** for **Paryapt Tiryanch** is considered in the fifth Gunasthan, excluding the **Apratyaakhyanaavaran** **Kshaya Chatushk**.

In summary, out of the 117 **Bandhyogya** **Prakritis** in the first **Mithyatva** Gunasthan of the **Paryapt Tiryanch**, 101 **Prakritis** are bound in the second **Saasvadan** Gunasthan after reducing the 16 **Prakritis** like **Narakatrik** etc., which are bound due to the arising of **Mithyatva**. And, the binding of **Devaayu** and **Ananta**...

## Bandhasvamitva

**Bandhasvamitva** refers to the ownership of the bondage of karmas. 

This passage describes the bondage of karmas in different stages of spiritual progress, starting from the **BalasvAmitva** (stage of initial bondage) and moving towards the **Desavirat** (stage of detachment).

**BalasvAmitva:**

* **25** **Prakritis** (types of karmas) caused by **Kashaya** (passions) and **6** **Prakritis** unsuitable for humans, totaling **32** **Prakritis**, are not bound.
* This leaves **66** **Prakritis** out of the **101** **Prakritis** that can be bound in the **Dvitiya Gunasthan** (second stage of spiritual progress).
* In the **Mishra Gunasthan** (mixed stage), **66** **Prakritis** can be bound.
* In the **Tritiya Gunasthan** (third stage), **70** **Prakritis** can be bound, including the **Devaayu** (divine life force).
* In the **Chaturtha Gunasthan** (fourth stage), **66** **Prakritis** are bound after removing the **Apratyaakhyana Avarana** (veil of non-acceptance) and **Chapay Chatushk** (four types of karmas).
* This process continues until the **Pancha Desavirat Gunasthan** (fifth stage of detachment), where **66** **Prakritis** are bound.

**ParyaptamAnushya (Perfect Human):**

* **ParyaptamAnushya** (perfect human) binds karmas similar to **ParyaptamAtiyantra** (perfect instrument) from the first to the fourth **Gunasthan**.
* However, **ParyaptamAnushya** can bind **Tirthankara Namakarma** (karma related to becoming a Tirthankara) but not **ParyaptamAtibandha** (perfect bondage).
* From the fifth **Gunasthan** onwards, they bind karmas as described in the **Dvitiya Karmagrantha** (second text on karmas).

**ApayaptamAtiyantra (Imperfect Instrument) and Manushya (Human):**

* **ApayaptamAtiyantra** and **Manushya** bind **106** **Prakritis** out of **117**, excluding **Tirthankara Namakarma** and other **11** **Prakritis**.

**Conclusion:**

This passage explains the **Bandhasvamitva** of **ParyaptamAnushya**, **ApayaptamAtiyantra**, and **Manushya**, highlighting the different types of karmas they bind and the stages of spiritual progress they achieve.

The third category, other than the above two, is that of humans. Consider the concepts of Dharma and Adharma, and those who can remember the Guru-dosha, etc., through their mind. Those who are excellent in matters of the mind are called humans.  Like the Tiryanchas, humans are also primarily divided into two categories: sufficient and insufficient. Of these two categories, the sufficient bind 120 types of karmas, more than the ordinary. The description of these 120 bindable karmas has been given in detail in another Karmagrantha. However, for the sake of brief knowledge, their number should be understood as follows: _Jnanabaran 5, Darshanabaran 6, Vedrigah 2, Mohaniya 26, Ayu 4, Naam 67, Gotra 2, Antaraya 5. Combining these categories, we get a total of 120 karmas.

Out of the above 120 karmas, in the first Mithyatva Gunasthan, sufficient humans, like sufficient Tiryanchas, do not bind the three karmas of Tirthankar-namakarma, Aharak-katrik, Aharak-sharira, Aharak-angopang, and Shunya. This is because the binding of Tirthankar-namakarma occurs in the Samyak-tva state, and the binding of Aharak-nik occurs in the An-mattasangat state. However, in the Mithyatva-drishti Gunasthan, neither Samyak-tva nor An-mattasangat is possible for beings. Samyak-tva is not possible before the fourth Gunasthan, and An-mattasangat is not possible before the seventh Gunasthan. Therefore, in the first Gunasthan, sufficient humans bind 115 karmas.

In the second *guna-sthāna* (stage of spiritual progress), within the second *karma-grantha* (text on karma), the 16 *prakṛtis* (categories of karma) mentioned as "Rajaiyavarach Dav Chivak Namucchi (Gāthā 4)" are eliminated by the end of the first *guna-sthāna*. Therefore, the *paryāpta-manuṣya* (perfect human being) binds 101 *prakṛtis*.

In the third *miśra guna-sthāna* (mixed stage), the *paryāpta-manuṣya* binds 60 *prakṛtis* out of the 101 *prakṛtis* of the second *guna-sthāna*. This is because, according to the *bandha-svāmitva* (law of binding) for *paryāpta-tiryac* (perfect animal), 25 *prakṛtis* with *devāyu* (divine life) and *ananta-navandhi* (infinitely non-binding) *kaṣāya* (passions) and 6 *prakṛtis* suitable for human existence are eliminated, totaling 32 *prakṛtis*.

Although the *paryāpta-tiryac* in the fourth *guna-sthāna* binds 30 *prakṛtis* due to binding *deva* (divine) karma along with the 66 *prakṛtis* from the third *guna-sthāna*, the *paryāpta-manuṣya* binds 71 *prakṛtis* due to the binding of *tīrtha-rāma-karma* (karma of a Tirthankara) along with the aforementioned 70 *prakṛtis*. This is because, while the *paryāpta-tiryac* attains *samyak-tvā* (perfect knowledge) in the fourth *guna-sthāna*, they lack the *adhyavasāya* (determination) necessary to bind *tīrtha-kara-nāma-karma* (karma of a Tirthankara) and therefore cannot bind it.

In the *karma-grantha* part 2 (*karma-stava*), the *bandha-adhikāra* (right to bind) for *paryāpta-manuṣya* and *tiryac* in the third *miśra* and fourth *avirat-samyak-dṛṣṭi* (uninterrupted perfect vision) *guna-sthāna* is described as follows: The *karma-stava* mentions the binding of 74 *prakṛtis* in the third *miśra* *guna-sthāna* and 77 *prakṛtis* in the fourth *avirat-samyak-dṛṣṭi* *guna-sthāna*. However, in the *tiryac* *miśra* *guna-sthāna*, the five *prakṛtis* of *manuṣya-dvīka*, *audārika-dvīka*, and *vajra-ṛṣabha-nārāca-saṁhanana* are not bound, resulting in the binding of 66 *prakṛtis*.

The third karma, *Avirat Samyagdristi Gunasthan*, binds 70 *Prakritis* including *Devaayu* and the *Tithankara* *Namakarma* in the *Avirat Samyagdristi Gunasthan*, along with *Devaayu*, binds 71 *Prakritis*. In the fourth *Gunasthan*, these 71 *Prakritis* are combined with six *Prakritis* - *Manushyadvik*, *Audarikadhik*, *Bṛṣabhanārāc* *Sanhanan*, and *Manushyāyu* - resulting in 77 *Prakritis* bound, as stated in the *Karmastava Bandhadhikar*. Additionally, the 66 *Prakritis* bound in the third *Gunasthan* for *Pāpti* *Manushya* and *Tiryach* include five *Prakritis* from the aforementioned six, excluding *Manushyāyu*, leading to a total of 74 *Prakritis* bound.

The binding of *Paryāpta* *Manushya* from the first to the fourth *Gunasthan* should be understood as described above. From the fifth to the thirteenth *Gunasthan*, the number of *Prakritis* bound in each *Gunasthan* should be understood according to the *Bandhayoga* *Prakritis* mentioned in the *Bandhadhikar* of the second *Karmagrantha*. For example, in the fifth *Gunasthan*, 67 *Prakritis* are bound, in the sixth *Gunasthan*, 63 *Prakritis* are bound, and in the seventh *Gunasthan*, 56 or 58 *Prakritis* are bound. For detailed information, refer to the *Bandhadhikar* of the second *Karmagrantha*.

The binding of 63 *Prakritis* for *Paryāpta* *Manushya* and 66 *Prakritis* for *Paryāpta* *Tiryach* in the fifth *Gunasthan* is mentioned, while the second *Karmagrantha* states that 67 *Prakritis* are bound in the fifth *Gunasthan*. The reason for this discrepancy is that *Paryāpta* *Tiryach*, even after attaining *Samyaktva* in the fourth *Gunasthan*, do not have the *Adhyavasaya* to bind the *Tithankara* *Namakarma*, resulting in the binding of 70 *Prakritis*. These 70 *Prakritis* are reduced to 66 *Prakritis* by excluding the *Apratyaasthanāvarana* *Kaphāyachatuṣka*.

However, *Paryāpta* *Manushya* in the fourth *Gunasthan* can bind the *Tithankara* *Namakarma*. Therefore, from the general binding, 71 *Prakritis* are bound...

Bandhaswami
It is said that by reducing the fourfold classification of non-rejection (Apratyaakhyana Varana Chatushk), 67 karmas are bound.
After stating the Bandhaswamitva of sufficient animals and humans, now we explain the Bandhaswamitva of insufficient animals and humans, both in general and in particular! _ Insufficient animals and insufficient humans - in these, the word "insufficient" should be understood as "Lendhi" insufficient, not "Karpa" insufficient. Because the reason for the word "insufficient" having the said meaning is that an insufficient human can also bind the Tirthankara-namakarma.
In general, these Lendhi-sufficient animals and humans, out of the 120 karmas that can be bound, 11 karmas are reduced - Tirthankara-namakarma, Devadvik, Kriyadvik, Aharakdvik, Devayu, Narakatrik - leaving 106 karmas to be bound. And in the insufficient state, only Mithyatva-munasthan is present, so in this munasthan, 16 karmas can also be bound. Because in Mithyadristi, Tirthankara-namakarma and Aharakdvik are not bound, and they do not go to the Devagati after death, therefore Devadvik, Vaikriya-dvik and Devayu are also not bound. Insufficient beings are not born in Narakagati, therefore Narakatrik is also not bound. Therefore, by reducing the said eleven karmas, it is considered that 109 karmas are bound in the Mithyatva-munasthan of insufficient animals and humans, compared to the general case.
In summary, in the human state, sufficient humans have fourteen gunasthanas and 120 karmas can be bound from the general case. But now, only Bandhaswamitva in relation to the human state.

## The Story of Binding

**It is important to understand the binding of karmas according to the previous chapters, which describe the binding of karmas for all beings from the first to the fifth **guna-sthana**. However, there is a special characteristic in the fourth and fifth **guna-sthana**. In the fourth **guna-sthana**, the **tiryanch** bind 70 **prakritis**, while in the fifth **guna-sthana**, they bind 66 **prakritis**. However, in the fourth **guna-sthana**, humans also bind the **tirthankara-namakarma**, resulting in a total of 71 **prakritis** bound. Similarly, in the fifth **guna-sthana**, humans bind 67 **prakritis**.

Therefore, the total number of **prakritis** bound by **paryapta** beings is: 117 in the first **guna-sthana**, 101 in the second **guna-sthana**, 66 in the third **guna-sthana**, 71 in the fourth **guna-sthana**, and 67 in the fifth **guna-sthana**. From the sixth to the thirteenth **guna-sthana**, the binding of karmas should be understood as described in the second **karma-grantha**.

**A-paryapta** humans and **tiryanch** do not bind the **tirthankara-namakarma** and the eleven **prakritis** related to **naraka-trika** and **paryanta**. Therefore, their binding should be understood as 106 **prakritis** less than the **paryapta** beings in the first **guna-sthana**.

After explaining the binding of karmas in the human realm, the following chapters will describe the binding of karmas in the **deva-gana**.

**The binding of karmas for **naraka** beings is similar to that of **devas**. However, there is a difference in the binding of karmas in the first **guna-sthana**. **Eka-indriya-trika** **devas** bind karmas, but **naraka** beings do not. The same applies to **kalpa-dvipa**.

**Jyotishka**, **bhavana-pati**, and **vyantar** **devas** bind all **prakritis** except the **tirthankara-namakarma**, similar to the **devas** of the first and second **deva-loka**.

## Self-Ownership

**Special Note:** We are now discussing the bondage-ownership in the heavenly realm, in comparison to the general and the qualities of the realms. The heavenly beings, namely the Bhavanavasi, Vyantar, Jyotishka, and Kalpavasis, are distinct categories. Even in the heavenly realm, there are four qualities similar to the hellish realm. Therefore, after explaining the general bondage-ownership, we are now describing the bondage-ownership in relation to the qualities of these four categories.

Although the bondage of the heavenly beings is similar to the bondage of the hellish beings in terms of nature, there are some differences in the bondage-worthy natures in the heavenly realm due to the possibility of being born as an Ekendriya-Trika, Ekendriya, Sthavar, and Atap. This is because the heavenly beings, unlike the hellish beings, can be born in these categories.

The statement "Niryadh Suraya" (meaning "Hellish beings are not born in the heavenly realm") implies that just as hellish beings do not die and get reborn in the hellish or heavenly realms, similarly, heavenly beings also do not die and get reborn in these two realms. Therefore, they do not bind the eight natures: Devanik, Naraktrik, and Vaikriya-Dvik. They also do not bind the Aharak-Dvik due to the absence of the first quality, Sarvadis. Furthermore, heavenly beings do not die and get reborn as subtle Ekendriya or Vikala-Indriya, which means they do not bind the six natures: Sukhma-Trika and Vikala-Indriya-Trika. Thus, by excluding these 16 natures from the total 120 bondage-worthy natures, the heavenly beings bind 104 natures in general.

In the hellish realm, it is said that 101 natures are bound because 16 natures, from Sura-Dvik to Asap Karma, are not bound out of the total 120 bondage-worthy natures. However, in the hellish realm, the three natures: Ekendriya-Trika, Ekendriya, Sthavar, and Atap are also included. But heavenly beings can be born as Badar Ekendriya after death. Therefore, heavenly beings bind these three natures more than hellish beings. Hence, in comparison to the hellish realm...

## Sutiy Karmagranth

**Considering the bondage of the 16 types of Prakṛtis in the Bharakagati as an obstacle in the commonality of the Devas, the bondage of 104 Prakṛtis is considered due to the bondage of Ekendriyatrika, instead of 101 Prakṛtis of the Devas.**

**In this way, the bondage of 174 Prakṛtis in the Devagati from the commonality should be understood in the same way for the first Sodharma and the second Ishana Kalpas of the Kalpavasī Devas.**

**Out of the 104 Prakṛtis that are bondable in the commonality, the bondage of 103 Prakṛtis occurs due to the bondage of Tirthankara-namakarma in the Mithyatva Gunasthan of the Devas of the Devagati and the aforementioned Kalpattika, and the remaining 6, 70, and 12 Prakṛtis are bound in the second, third, and fourth Gunasthans respectively, similar to the Narakagati.**

**The bondage of Tirthankara-namakarma does not occur in the Devas of the Jyotishka, Bhavanavāsī, and Vyantara Nikayas, so the bondage of 103 Prakṛtis should be understood in comparison to the commonality and the first Mithyatva Gunasthan, because the Devas of these three Nikayas do not become Tirthankaras after leaving them, and beings with the essence of Tirthankara-nama do not arise in the Bhavanapati, Antara, and Jyotirūka Devanikayas. Also, the beings of these three Nikayas do not go to the Parbhava with Avadhishana, and Tirthankaras are born in the Gharbhaka with Avadhishana. Therefore, the bondage of Tirthankara-namakarma does not occur in the Devas of these three Nikayas.**

**Therefore, the bondage of 103 Prakṛtis in the commonality and the first Gunasthan, 66 in the second, 70 in the third, and 71 instead of 72 in the fourth due to the absence of the bondage of Tirthankara-namakarma in the Devas of the three Nikayas like Jyotishka, etc.**

**In summary, even though the rule of bondage being similar to Narakagati in comparison to the commonality in Devagati, the bondage of Ekendriyatrika is more. Therefore, just as in Narakagati, the commonality is 101...**

##  Manasvamitva

The bondage of the 1.1 Prakṛtis is considered, but it should be understood that the bondage of 104 Prakṛtis is to be considered when the Ekendriya (one-sense) Prakṛtis are added to these 1.1 Prakṛtis.

The bondage of these 104 Prakṛtis should be understood from the common to the Kalpavāsi Devas and the Devas of the first and second Kalpas. However, in the Mithyātva Guṇasthāna, there is no bondage of the Tīrthankara Nāmakarma, so there are 103 Prakṛtis. In the second Guṇasthāna, due to the rise of Mithyātva, the Ekendriya Jāti and other seven Prakṛtis are not bound, so there are 16 less. And from these 66 Prakṛtis, the Anantānubandhī Chatuṣka and other 26 Prakṛtis are reduced, so in the third Guṇasthāna, there is bondage of 70 Prakṛtis. And in the fourth Guṇasthāna, due to the bondage of the Manushayāyu and Tīrthankara Nāmakarma, there is bondage of 72 Prakṛtis, as these two Prakṛtis are added to the 70 Prakṛtis of the Miśra Guṇasthāna.

The Devas of the Jyotiṣka, Bhavanapati, and Vyantar Nikāyas do not have the bondage of the Tīrthankara Nāmakarma. Therefore, the Prakṛtis that are bondable from the common to these three Nikāyas are 103, and in the Mithyātva Guṇasthāna, there is also bondage of 103 Prakṛtis. In the second and third Guṇasthānas, there are 66 and 70 Prakṛtis respectively, similar to the Kalpavāsi Devas, and in the fourth Guṇasthāna, due to the absence of the bondage of the Tīrthankara Nāmakarma, there is bondage of 71 Prakṛtis instead of 72.

In this way, after explaining the bondage of Manasvamitva from the common to the Kalpavāsis, and the Kalpadvika and Jyotiṣka, Bhavanapati, and Vyantar Nikāyas, in the following verse, the description of Manasvamitva in the Kalpas of Sanatkumāra, etc., and in the Indriya and Kārmāṇā is given...

## Sutiy Karma

The karma of the gods from Sanatkumar onwards in the Devalokas should be understood as similar to the marakas of the Ratnaprabha Naraka, and in the Anat etc., all but the four Ukhots should be considered as bondage. In the one-sensed, earth, water, plant, and the disabled-sensed, bondage of 109 types occurs, similar to the insufficient three-fold bondage.

**Special Note:** This verse describes the bondage of the gods from the third Devaloka, Sanatkumar, to the Navagrambheyaka Devas, and the bondage of the one-sensed, disabled-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, and four-sensed in the Indriyamargna, and the earth, water, and plant-bodied beings in the Kayamargna.

The verse describes the bondage of the gods from Sanatkumar to Navagrambheyaka in two parts. The first part includes the gods from Sanatkumar to the eastern Sahasrar of the Anat heaven, and the second part includes the gods from the Anat heaven to Navagrambheyaka.

Although the verse does not mention the Anuttara Vimanas, the Anuttara Vimanas always produce Samyakkrusti beings, and their fourth Gunasthan is the only one. Therefore, due to the lack of increase or decrease in the bondage of karma-types, the bondage is the same as that of the general Gunasthan. The gods in the fourth Gunasthan have bondage of 72 types, so it should be understood that they also have the same.

In the above two parts, the gods from Sanatkumar to the Sahalar Devaloka in the first part, like the narakas of the Ratnaprabha Naraka, should be understood to have the same number of karma-types as they bind in the general and the Munasthanas. Because these gods are not born in the one-sensed when they leave those Devalokas, they do not bind the three types of karma: one-sensed-applicable one-sensed jati, sthavar nama, and aatpa mama. Therefore, they bind 101 types of karma in general. In the Mithyatva Gunasthan, the Tirthankara nama...

**Graming**

The 100 karmas without karma, 16 without the Napumsak Chaturuk in the Sasvadan Gunasthan, and 70 without the Ananta Anubandhi Chaturuk etc. 26 in the Misra Gunasthan, and 72 in the Avira Samyamdrishti Gunasthan due to the binding of the Manushyayu, Tirthankar Naamakarma, bind 72 prakritis.

The Devas from Anatadi Navagran to Veyak Paryant, the Udyot Chaturshka: Udyot Naama, Tiryanch Gati, Tithanchanupurvi and Sina, do not bind these four Prakalis. Because these Devas are born in the Manushya Gati after falling from these heavens, not in the Tibandhas. Therefore, the Tiryanch Prayogya do not bind these four prakritis. Therefore, in the 120 prakritis, they bind 15 prakritis in general by reducing the 19 prakritis like Suradvik etc. and the four prakritis like Uchot etc. and they destroy 16 in the first, 12 in the second, 10 in the third and 72 in the fourth Gunasthanas respectively.

Samyaktvi Jivas are born in the Anusar Vimanas and the fourth Gunasthan is according to Sammanav. Therefore, one should understand that they bind 72 prakritis in general and according to the Gunasthan.

After explaining the Bandhaswamitva in the Gati Margna, now we will explain the Bandhaswamitva in the Indriya and Kama Margna.

The Jivas in the Indriya Margna, Ekeindriya, Dveindriya, Triindriya and Chaturindriya, and in the Kama Margna, Prithvikaaya, Apkaaya and Vanaspatikaaya, bind 106 prakritis like the Apyaapt Tiryanchas. Because the Apyaapt Tiryanchas or Manushya do not bind 11 prakritis from Tirthankar Naamakarma to Narakatrik Paryant, similarly these seven Margna Jivas do not have Samyaktva and the Devagati and

Sutosh Karmaprastha are not born in Narakagati. Therefore, they do not bind the eleven natures: Tirthankaranam, Davati, Devanupurvi, Devayu, Narakagati, Narakanupurvi, Narakayu, Bainkriya Sharira, Bainkriya Angopang, Aharak Sharira, Aharak Angopang. Therefore, they bind 106 natures in the 4th Mithyatva Gunasthan from the general.

In summary, from Sanatkumar to Sahasrar Devalokaparyant, the Dev Ratnaprabha bind 101 natures from the general, like the Narakas of Narak, and 100 in Mithyatva Gunasthan, 66 in Sasvadan Gunasthan, 50 in Misra Gunasthan, and 72 in Avirat Samyagdristi Gunasthan.

From Anat to Nav Ganveyak, the Devas are not born in Tiryanmagati. Therefore, they do not bind Tirf Dhagliyogya Udyot, Tirvacgati, Tiryanchanapurvi, and Tiryanchay. Therefore, from the 101 natures considered generally bindable in Sanatkumar etc. Devas, these four natures are also reduced, making them bind 97 natures from the general. In terms of Gunasthan, the Anat etc. Kalpa Devas should be understood to bind 66, 62, 70, and 72 natures respectively.

In Anuttar Vimanas, Samyaktvi Jin are born, and they have the fourth Gunasthan. Therefore, from the general and in terms of Gunasthan, they should be understood to bind 72 natures, the same as the fourth Gunasthan of the previously mentioned Devas.

After explaining the binding in the different types of Gatimargna, the binding in the Kram-prapta Indriya and Kay Margna is mentioned.

There are five Indriyas: Sparshan, Rasna, Pran, Chakshu, and Dhrotra. The number of Indriyas a Jiva has determines...

## Translation:

42
A being with many senses is called a many-sensed being. For example, a being with only the sense of touch is called a one-sensed being, a being with the senses of touch and taste is called a two-sensed being. In this way, by adding one sense at a time, beings with five senses are called five-sensed beings. Of these beings, from one-sensed to five-sensed, this verse describes the bondage of one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, and four-sensed beings, as well as the bondage of the three types of bodies - earth body, water body, and plant body - within the six categories mentioned earlier in the context of body-path.

These seven types of beings, from one-sensed to four-sensed, and earth, water, and plant bodies, should be understood to have bondage of 109 natures in general, similar to the bondage of the insufficient Tiryanchas mentioned in the motion-path. And the bondage of 106 natures should be understood for the insufficient controllers in the first guna-sthana of the insufficient Tiryanchas.

In this way, after explaining the bondage of the gods from Sanatkumar to Anuttar in the motion-path, the one-sensed to the defective-sensed in the sense-path, and the earth body, water body, and plant body in the body-path, the following verse explains a different opinion regarding the bondage of one-sensed beings, etc., in relation to the guna-sthana of savasana...

"Even without the subtle-trika and other thirteen natures, the one-sensed beings, etc., bind 66 natures in the savasana guna-sthana. Some Acharyas believe that they do not achieve full bodily perfection, and therefore bind 14 natures without the lifespan of a Tiryancha and a human."

1. "Not a being" is also a reading.

## Third Karma Granth
## Prohibition Meaning

This verse explains the bondage of the **Y. Nimoniya. C., Ap, and plant-bodied beings** in the **Swasadan Gunasthan**.

The previous verse explained the bondage of 106 **Prakritis** in the **Mithyatva Gunasthan** for beings with one sense organ, etc., compared to the **Mar and Gumasthan** of beings with one sense organ, etc. Out of these 101 **Prakritis**, 13 **Prakritis** are bound by the arising of **Mithyatva** in the **Swasadan Gunasthan**: **Sukshmatrik, Vikalvik, Ekendiy jati, Sthavar naam, Napusakaved, Mithyatvamohaniya, Hund Sansthan, and Sewat Sanhanan**. However, since **Mithyatva** does not arise in the **Swasadan Gunasthan**, the bondage of 66 **Prakritis** occurs when these 13 **Prakritis** are reduced. This is because when **Devas** of the **Bhavanapatti, Vyantar, etc. Devjati** attain **Samyaktva** after binding the **Ayu** of **Ekendiy-Prayogya** due to **Mithyatvanimittak**, they are born as **Ekendiy** at the time of death after vomiting **Samyaktva**. If they attain **Swasadan Samyaktva** before their body is fully developed, they bind 66 **Prakritis**.

However, other **Acharyas** believe that these beings with one sense organ, etc., do not bind the **Ayu** of **Tiryanchay** and **Manushy** during other **Gunasthanas**, and therefore bind only 64 **Prakritis**. In this same **Granth**, the **Audarik Mishra** also prohibits **Ayu-bandh** in the **Swasadan Gunasthan** because it is insufficient.

The principle is that no being can bind **Ayu** without completing **Indriyaparapti**.

##  The Difference in the Number of  *Bandhasvamitva* (Binding Ownership) of 66 and 64 *Prakritis* (Principles)

The difference in the *Bandhasvamitva* of 66 and 64 *Prakritis* is also seen in ancient *Bandhasvamitva*. The following verses relate to this:

"A *Saana* (small) being, even if it is *Lolasa* (greedy) and *Martig* (prone to death), does not die. It is bound by the *Oghena* (flow of karma), *Bosusar* (the five senses), and *Panchinya* (the five senses) in the 13th *Sandhi* (stage)." (13)

"A *Saana* being, even if it is *Savilidi* (with a body) and *Sanu* (small), does not die. It is bound by the *Nar* (man), *Tirya* (animal), and *Agandha* (odorless) *Mayansaran* (the five senses) in the 24th *Sandhi*." (24)

Those who believe in 16 *Prakritis* believe that after the completion of the *Indriyaparyapti* (perfection of the senses), when the time for *Ayubandha* (binding of life) comes, the *Saasvadan* (enjoyment) feeling remains. Therefore, a one-sensed being, etc., can be bound in the *Saasvadan* *Gunasthan* (state of qualities) as a *Tiryanch* (animal) or a *Manudhya* (human).

However, the *Acharyas* (teachers) who believe in 64 *Prakritis* believe that the lifespan of a one-sensed being is 256 *Avali* (units of time). The lifespan of the next birth is bound in the third part of the lifespan of this birth after the lifespan of this birth has passed two-thirds of its way. In other words, the lifespan of the next birth is bound in the 171st *Avali* after 170 *Avali* of the 256 *Avali* lifespan of this birth has passed. The time for *Saasvadan* *Samyakd* (right knowledge) (six *Avali*) is already over. Even if we assume that the first three *Paryapti* (perfections) are completed in the *Saasvadan* state, *Ayubandha* is not possible. The *Audarik* (generous) *Mishn* (path) *Margna* (path) states that there are 64 *Prakritis* of binding. Therefore, the belief in 64 *Prakritis* of binding seems to be logical.

Shri *Jivavijayaji* and *Jayasomasuri* have also stated the same in their *Tave* (commentary) in support of this belief. *Gommatasar* *Karmakand* (the section on karma in the *Gommatasar* text) also supports this belief by *Namichandra* *Siddhantchakravarti*.

"The *Purinavar* (ancient ones) have said that the *Vigivigala* (those who have attained liberation) are *Tathushana* (those who have attained the state of being) and *Sasaai* (those who have attained the state of being). They have said that *Pajjati* (those who are born) are *Mavi* (those who are not liberated) and *Pavi* (those who are liberated) and *Iritirip* (those who are bound) and *Aaus* (those who are not bound)." (1131)

## 45
### The Third Karma Text
(Understanding the 106 natures that are capable of bondage in the state of *ferrato* in the one-sensed and the three-impaired, that is, the two-sensed, three-sensed, and four-sensed, because the *Tirthankaras*, the two *Aharakas*, the gods, the human beings, the hell beings, and the *Vaikriya* beings do not experience bondage of these 12 natures. And a being born in the one-sensed and the three-impaired cannot complete the body (physical form) in the *Savasdana* *Gunasthan* because the time of *Savasdana* is short and the time of the state of insufficient liberation is very long. For this reason, the bondage of human life and *Ticha* also does not occur in this *Gunasthan*.)

The explanation of the above two opinions is as follows:
'In the opinion regarding the bondage of 66 and 14 natures in the *Savasdana* *Gunasthan* in the one-sensed etc., the opinion of those who believe in the bondage of 66 natures is that even after the body is fully complete, *Savasdana* remains, and if at that time the bondage of lifespan occurs, then the bondage of 66 natures occurs! This suggests that the *Antarmukhurta* becomes *Gadyam* in the six *Avaliakas*, therefore the body becomes complete in the six *Avaliakas*, and after that the bondage of lifespan occurs. However, Shri *Jivavijayaji* and *Jayasomasuri* have shown in their own works and in the *Yommatsar* *Karmakanda* that the lifespan of the one-sensed etc. is 256 *Avaliakas* in length, and the bondage of lifespan is possible only after two-thirds of it, that is, 170 *Avaliakas*, have passed. But before that, *Savasdana* *Samyaktva* disappears, because it lasts until the end of the six *Avaliakas*. Therefore, even if it is assumed that the body and the senses become fully complete in the *Savasdana* state, the bondage of lifespan is not possible in any way in the *Savasdana* state. As evidence of this, the *Audarikmitra* *Maganga* has mentioned the bondage of 64 natures related to the *Savasdana* *Gunasthan*. The *Gommatsar* *Karmakanda* also states that a *Savasdana* *Samyaktvi* being born in the one-sensed and the three-impaired, the body becomes fully complete...

Page #76:
---------------------------

"If one cannot fulfill the entire [karma], then he does not get bound by the Manushyayu and Titrayu in that state."
Atham-sva
From the above evidence, it becomes clear that the side of the bondage of 4 prakritis appears to be agreeable and reasonable. However, what is the intention of the Acharyas who believe in the bondage of 66 prakritis is only knowable to the Kevalis.
The gist is that the beings of Ekendriya, Vikalatrai, Dviendriya, Triendriya, Chaturindriya, Prithvikra, Akaya and Vanaspatikaaya, in the Sasvadan Gunasthan, reduce the thirteen prakritis like Sukshmatrik etc. from the 106 prakritis that are eligible for bondage in the Freera Reasthan, and have to bind 96 prakritis. And some Acharyas believe that these beings of Ekendriya etc. up to Vanaspatikaaya, who have seven Margena, do not have complete Sharira-paryapti in the Sasvadan Gunasthan, so they do not get bound by Manushyayu and Titrayu related to Parbhav. Therefore, they bind 64 prakritis.
After stating the bondage-ownership of Ekendriya etc., in the next verse, they tell about the duafora related to Panchendriya, Gativasa and Yog Margena.
Ohu Panidi Tase Gaitase Jivikar Naratimuchcha Vina. Manatrayajoge Oho Use Narbhanghu Tammisse 13 Gatharth - To know the bondage similar to the bondage mentioned in the Ogh-Vaidhadhikar in the Panchendriya jati and Sakaya, and in the Galiyas, except for Jinekaadasha, Manushyamika and Uchchagotra, the bondage of the remaining 205 prakritis takes place, and in Manoyog and Vachanayog, to understand the bondage similar to the Ogh-Bandhadhikar, and in Audarik Kayayog, to understand the bondage similar to the Manushya Gati, and in Audarik Misra, ant at afa, they do it in the next verse.

Page #77:
---------------------------
##  47
### Third Karma-Pratya
**Special Meaning:** This verse begins the discussion of the five-sense beings (Panchendriya-jati), the body (Jaskaya), and the mobile beings (Gatis) in relation to karma.

The bondage ownership (Bandhaswamitva) of the five-sense beings and the body should be understood in the same way as the bondage ownership in general and according to the bondage described in relation to the Gunasthanas. This means, just as the Karmagrantha in the second part describes the bondage of 120 types in general and 117, 101, 74, 77, etc. types in the Gunasthanas from the first to the thirteenth, respectively, the bondage of the five-sense beings and the body should also be understood as 120 types in general and 117, 101, 74, 77, etc. types in the Gunasthanas, respectively. Similarly, in any other Margana where bondage ownership is mentioned, it should be understood that the bondage ownership is the same in all the Gunasthanas that are possible in that Margana.

In the scriptures, all living beings (Jivas) are considered to be of two types: mobile (Gativas) and immobile (Labdhiyas). Those who experience the rise of the S-karma and are also mobile are called Labdhiyas. Those who experience the rise of the stationary karma (Sthavar-karma) but possess the ability to move are called Gativas. The bondage ownership of the four types of Labdhiyas has already been explained. Now, we will explain the bondage ownership of the Gativas.

There are two types of Gativas: Danta and Vakaya. Both of these experience the rise of the stationary karma (Sthavar-karma). However, due to their similarity in movement, they are called Gativas.

1. Dwindriya, Triindriya, Chaturindriya, Panchendriya - these are called so because they experience the rise of the S-karma.

Page #78:
---------------------------
## 46
## Ownership of Bondage

In the commonality of these two buses, in the 120 natures that are capable of bondage, the 11 natures from Jina-Ekadasha, meaning Tirthankara-namakarma, to Naraka-trika, and the 15 natures of Manushya-trika and Uccha-gotra, do not bind. Therefore, out of the 120 natures, 15 are excluded, leaving 105 natures that are capable of bondage.

The reason why the 15 natures, starting with Tirthankara-namakarma, do not bind is because the beings of Kaya and Vayu-kaya are not born in Devas, humans, and Narakas. Therefore, they do not bind the 14 natures that are suitable for them. Teu-kaya and Vayu-kaya beings are born in Tithanch-gati, and there, the Bhavanimittak-ni Man-udaya occurs. Therefore, they cannot bind Uccha-gotra.

These two Gati-trasas only have Mithyatva-grunasthan, not Sasvadan-gunasthan, because no being who vomits Samyaktva is born in this Gunasthan. Therefore, just as Teu-kaya and Vayu-kaya beings bind 105 natures in general, similarly, in Mithyatva-gunasthan, 105 natures are bound.

After discussing the ownership of bondage in Kaya-margana, now we explain the ownership of bondage in Yoga-margana.

At the root of Yoga are Manoyoga, Vachanayoga, and Kayayoga - these are the three main divisions. And within these, there are four divisions of Manoyoga, four divisions of Vachanayoga, and seven divisions of Kayayoga. In the two divisions of Manoyoga and Manoyoga-mahit Vachanayoga, there are thirteen Gunasthanas. Therefore, one should understand the bondage in them according to the bondage explained in the second Karma-grantha.

In the Gash's 'Manavayam-oge Oho Urne Darbhanga' verse, 'Manashya-yoge' and 'Urle' - these two words are common. However, the meaning of 'Oho' and 'Bharamangu' used in between is Manoyoga-sahit Vachanayoga.

Page #79:
---------------------------
## Third Chapter

And the meaning of "Ural" should be understood as **Audarik Kayayog** including **Manoyog** and **Vachanayog**. The concept of **Bandhaswamitva** has been considered from the same perspective. But if only **Vachanayog** is taken from **Ayog** and only **Audarik Kayayog** from **Varal**, then **Vachanayog** without **Manoyog** should be understood as **Bandhaswamitva** similar to **Vikalendriya** and **Kayayog** should be understood as similar to **Ekendriya**. That is, just as in **Vikalendriya** and **Ekendriya**, the **Bandhaswamitva** in them should be understood in the same way.

The summary is that in **Panchendriya** and **As Margna**, **Bandha** should be understood as similar to **Samanya Bandhadhikar**. And in **Galitras**, **Jin-Ekadas**, **Manushyatrika**, and **Uchchgotra**, these 15 **Prakritis** are reduced to 105 **Prakritis**, and **Bandha** occurs from **Samanya** and in the first **Gunasthan**.

In **Yog Margna**, **Bandha** should be understood as similar to the **Bandha** mentioned in the **Manudhya** of those who have **Audarik Kayayog** including **Manoyog** and **Vachanayog**. The **Bandhaswamitva** of only **Vachanayog** and **Kayayog** should be understood as similar to the **Bandha** mentioned as similar to **Ekendriya** and **Vikalendriya**.

Thus, after explaining the **Bandhaswamitva** in **Man**, **Vachan**, and **Audarik Kayayog** including them, and in **Kayayog** as **Audarik Kayayog**, they further explain the **Bandhaswamitva** in the remaining categories of **Kayayog**.

## Bamhasvami

**General Meaning:** (Taking the verse from the previous chapter) In the Audarik Mishrayog, there is bondage of 164 substances in general, without the Aharakapatak. In the Mithyatva Gunasthan, one should consider the bondage of 106 substances from the Jinanam Pancham. In Sasvadan, there is bondage of 14 substances except for the thirteen groups of 15 substances, including Manushyayu, Tiyanchayu, and Sukshmatrik.

**Specific Meaning:** In the previous verse, the bondage of Bamhasvami in the Audarik Mishrayog Kayayog Margha has been mentioned in general and in the first and second Gunasthan.

A living being coming from the previous birth, in the first instance of its birth, takes food only through Karmanayog. After that, the Audarik Kayayog begins. It is mixed with Karman until the body is complete. In the Kevalisamuddhat state, in the second, sixth, and seventh instances, it is mixed with Karman and Audarik Mishrayog. The Audarik Mishrayog is only in the incomplete state of humans and animals. It has four Gunasthan: first, second, fourth, and thirteenth.

In the Audarik Mishrayog, in general, there is bondage of 114 substances out of 120 substances that are eligible for bondage, excluding the Aharakatik - Aharak Sharira, Aharak Angopang, Devayu, and Naraktrik... Narakgati, Narakanupurvi, Narakayu. This is because, due to the absence of specific character, and because bondage occurs only in the seventh Gunasthan, the Aharakatik cannot be bound in the Audarik Mishrayog. Also, the bondage of these four substances - Devayu and... Naraktrik... - does not occur without the completion of the entire Paryapti. Therefore, the bondage of these six substances is not considered in the Audarik Mishrayog.

## Translation:

51. In the Audārikamishra Kāyayoga, during the first Mithyātva Guṇasthāna, out of the 114 Prakṛtis that are generally susceptible to bondage, 106 Prakṛtis are bound when the five Jinas - Tīrthaṅkara, Lāmakarma, Devati, Devanupūrvi, Baṅkriya Śarīra, and Vaikaya Angopāṅga - are reduced.

In the Audārikamishra Kāyayoga, the 101 Prakṛtis that are considered to be bound in the Mithyātva Guṇasthāna include Manushyāyu and Tithanchayu. In this regard, Śīlānka Āchārya believes that Audārikamishra Kāyayoga continues until the completion of Śarīra Paryāpti. Śrī Bhadrabahu Svāmī has also supported this view.

"The living being is nourished by the food that is eaten."
"The body is worn out by the passage of time."

Regarding this, Śrī Jīvavijaījī has raised a doubt in his commentary, stating that Audārikamishra Kāyayoga continues until the completion of Śarīra Paryāpti and not beyond. Āyubandha occurs after the completion of Śarīra Paryāpti and Indriya Paryāpti, not before. Therefore, during Audārikamishra Kāyayoga, i.e., before the completion of Śarīra Paryāpti, the bondage of Āyu is not possible. Hence, the inclusion of these two Āyus in the 106 Prakṛtis is debatable.

However, it is not a rule that Audārikamishra Kāyayoga continues only until the completion of Śarīra Paryāpti and not beyond.

The statement by Śrī Bhadrabahu Svāmī, "Śarīra Nikkalī," does not mean that the Audārikamishra Kāyayoga continues until the body is fully formed. The completeness of the body cannot be achieved solely by the completion of Śarīra Paryāpti. For this, the living being needs to have complete Paryāpti of its respective Indriya, Śvāsochchhvās, Bhāṣā, and Mana.

1. Audārikakāyayoga is present in humans until the completion of Śarīra Paryāpti.

It can be considered that the old forest has become. The meaning of the word 'Sarira Nipfatto' is not self-created. This Marg's Sapna Pada has been given by Suri in the fourth Karmagranth composed by him, in the fourth Maya, 'Samup Jaralmagne'. This part has been explained in the following commentary:
Although their bodies were created by the combination of the elements, due to the incompleteness of the body, the karma of this body is also mixed with the Audarikamishra Kayayog. Now, this is also a point that Audarikamishra Kayayog remains until all the necessary things are fulfilled. All the Audarikamishra Kayayog remains until the body is complete, not after that. And the Aayubandha happens after the body and senses are complete, not before. There is no room for doubt in this. Because even when the opportunity for Aayubandha comes after the senses are complete, Audarikamishra Kayayog remains. Therefore, it is appropriate to consider the bondage of these two Aayus, Manushyaayu and Tiyanchayu, during the time of Mithyal Munasthan in Audarikamishra Kayayog.
During the time of Mithyatva Gunartham, the bondage of the above two Aayus in Audarikamishra Kayayog is as described in the Karmagranth. The same is explained in Gommatsar Karmakand:
Lora ya Misme Na Suraniryauhani Rayadhurga:
Mihasun Bamotir Na Hi Avirde Atyi ||11||
Meaning... To know the creation of Audarikamishra Kayayog in Audarik Kayayog. The special thing is that the bondage of these six natures, Devayu, Narakayu, Aharakadvick, Narakgati, Narakanupurvi, does not happen.

That is, there are 114 **Prakritis** bound. Even in that, in the two **Gunasthanas** of **Mithyatva** and **Sasvadan**, the five **Prakritis** of **Devchatushk** and **Tirthankara** **Namakarma** are not bound, but they are bound in the fourth **Avirat Samyagdristi Gunasthan**. Not even the confirmation.

Suri has also done this in his **Daba**. He has written that, "If this side is accepted that **Audarik Mishra Kayayog** remains until the completion of **Sharira Paryapti**, then the killing of **Tiryancha** and **Manushyayu** in **Mithyatva** cannot happen in any way. Therefore, in comparison to this side, in that **Yog**, it should be understood that there are 112 **Prakritis** bound in general and 107 **Prakritis** in the **Mithyatva Gunasthan**.

From this statement, clear information is received that **Audarik Mishra Kayayog** remains until the completion of **Swayogya Paryapti**. From this, it becomes clear that it is reasonable to consider 114 **Prakritis** as generally bound in **Audarik Mishra Kayayog** and 102 **Prakritis** in the first **Mithyatva Gunasthan**.

After explaining the **Bandhaswamitva** of **Audarik Mishra Kayayog** in the first **Gunasthan**, now the **Swamitva** is explained in the second **Sasvadan Gunasthan**. In this **Gunasthan**, **Manushyayu** and **Tiryanchayu** are not bound. Because the living being who is in the **Sasvadan Gunasthan** does not complete **Sharira Paryapti**. Because after the completion of **Sharira Paryapti**, it is possible for **Ayubandha** to happen, and since **Mithyatva** does not arise here, the binding of 13 **Prakritis** from **Sukshmatrik** to **Seva Sanhanan** due to the arising of **Mithyatva** also does not happen. Therefore, by reducing these 15 **Prakritis** from the 106 **Prakritis** that are bound in the first **Mithyatva Gunasthan**, there are 94 **Prakritis** bound. That is, due to the separation of 13 **Prakritis** from the said 15 **Prakritis** at the end time of the **Mithyatva Gunasthan** and the non-binding of the two **Ayus**, there are **Prakritis** bound in the **Tunya Samasthan** of the one who has **Audarik Kayayog**.

Bandhaswamitva
The summary is that in the Audarikamitra Kayayog Marganga, there are 114 types of bandhyogya (capable of binding) from the general, and this yogi has first, second, and thirteenth places. Of these, the first gunasthan has 106 and the second gunasthan has 64 types.
..

Thus, after explaining the bandhaswamitva in the Audarikamitra Kayayog Marganga, from the general and in comparison to the first and second gunasthan, in the next gatha, they explain the bandhaswamitva in the fourth and thirteenth gunasthan. Along with this, they also explain the swamitva in the Karman Kayayog and Aharak Kayayogdvik.
Anchavasi Vina Jinapanjay Sambhi Jogini Sayam. Dinu Tirinaraou Kasme Vi Evam Aharavugiaoho ||15|| Gathath: From the aforementioned 94 types, by reducing the twenty-four types including Anantanubandh Chatushk, the remaining types, when combined with the Tirthankara name, result in 75 types of bandha in the fourth gunasthan of the Audarikamitra Kayayog, and only one Satavedaniya bandha in the Sayogikevali gunasthan. The Karman Kayayog is the same as the Tarfrator Kayayog, without the Tiryanchrayu and Manushyayu, and all other types. In the Aharakdvik, the bandha should be understood as the same as the bandha explained in the gunasthan.
Vishesharth: In the previous gatha and this gatha combined, the bandhaswamitva of the first, second, fourth, and thirteenth gunasthan of the Audarikamitra Kayayog has been considered. In the second gunasthan, the bandha of 24 types has been explained. By reducing the 24 types from Anantanubandhi Chatushk to Tiryanchdvik, 70 types remain.

## Third Karma Text
**1**
They remain, and in them, the combination of the five Jina, the Tīrthaṅkara, the Nāmakarma, the Devadvik, and the Vaikriya results in the bondage of 75 Prakṛtis in the fourth Guṇasthāna.

**Doubt:** In the fourth Guṇasthāna, the Audārika-miśra Kāyayoga is said to have ownership of the bondage of 75 Prakṛtis. Among them are the five Prakṛtis: Manuşyadvik, Ārfrefae, and Vajraṛṣabha-nārāca-sahana. On this, Śrī Jīvavijaī has raised a doubt in his commentary, stating that the Audārika-miśra Kāyayogi in the fourth Guṇasthāna cannot bind these five Prakṛtis. Because this yoga is not possible with anyone other than Tīrthaṅkara and Manuşya, and Niyantrā and Manuşya cannot bind these five Prakṛtis in this Guṇasthāna. Therefore, the 70 and 71 Prakṛtis mentioned in the Tīrthaṅkara-gati and Manuşya-gati in the fourth Guṇasthāna do not include these five Prakṛtis.

**Solution:** Śrī Jayasoṃasūri has resolved this doubt in his commentary, stating that the word "asa" in the verse should not be interpreted as "the 24 Prakṛtis starting with Anantānubandhī," but rather, the word "āha" should include five more Prakṛtis, making a total of 26 Prakṛtis, including the 24 starting with Anantānubandhī and the five starting with Manuşyadvik. This interpretation removes the doubt. Because subtracting 20 from 94 leaves 65 Prakṛtis, and adding the five Jina to them results in 70 Prakṛtis. The ownership of their bondage in that yoga at the time of that Guṇasthāna is not contradictory in any way. This solution seems authentic.

**Another point:** There is no word in the original verse that indicates the number 75. Śrī Nemicandra Siddhāntacakravartī also accepts the separation of 20 Prakṛtis in the second Guṇasthāna.

**Paṇṇarasasunu tī**
**Mirge avira chīvī cauro.**

## Samvasvāmin

Although the commentary (Tīkā) clearly states the bondage of 75 types of *bandhasvāmitva*, as mentioned earlier, the *bandhasvāmitva* named *prāguktā*, *banarvāta*, *ramasānubayādiśati*, *prativinā*, *jimnāmāvipratipakṣamatā*, and *pañcasaptati* *stāmovārika* *nikāyayogi* bind together. The ancient *karmagrantha* (Gāthā 2826) also considers the bondage of 75 types. Similarly, in the commentary on the ancient *bandhasvāmitva*, Śrī Govindācārya has not offered any solution to this doubt. This suggests that this topic has been passed down from tradition without much thought, both in the original text and the commentary. The *karmagranthakārās* should consider this. Until then, there is no harm in giving importance to the solution of Śrī Jayasomasūri.

The *Audārikamiśra Kāyayoga* states that humans and *tiryac* (non-human beings) are the masters of *kāyayoga*, and in the fourth *guṇasthāna* they are bound by 71 and 20 types of *prakrti* respectively. However, in the *Audārikamiśra Kāyayoga*, the bondage of 70 *prakrti* is accepted while considering the bondage of 71 *prakrti* in the fourth *guṇasthāna* because this *yoga* occurs in an incomplete state. In an incomplete state, humans or *tiryac* cannot be bound by *devāyu*. Because *devāyu* is included in the *prakrti* that can bind *tiryac* and humans. But the *Audārikamiśra Kāyayoga* has removed it from the *prakrti* that can bind.

In the thirteenth *guṇasthāna*, the *Audārikamiśra Kāyayoga* states that there is bondage of one *sātavēdaniya* *prakrti*. The explanation of this *bandhasvāmitva* in the *Audārikamiśra Kāyayoga* is based on the opinion of the *karma*...*āy*. But according to the principle...

1. The mentioned commentary is not by Śrī Devendrasūri.

Page #87:
---------------------------
## Third Karmagrantha

This yoga also includes two more (fifth, sixth) Gunasthanas. The Siddhanta's view is that at the time of the beginning of the Bainkriya body from Bainkriya Labdhi, i.e., in the fifth and sixth Gunasthanas, and at the time of the formation of the Aharak body from Aharak Labdhi, i.e., in the sixth Gunasthanas, there is Audarik-Mishra Kayayoga. This view is mentioned in the fourth Karmagrantha, verse 46.

"Sarapasave Nanam Vijayamaharage Uralammis.
Gidis Samano Nehabhiyam Suyamapam Ghi"

This is explained in detail in its own commentary... - A man who is a Naineyalambhidharak with an Audarik body, who has acquired the five knowledges, and who has sufficient Vayukaya, when he forms a Chakriya body, at that time, while residing in the Audarik body, he expands his territories and takes Bainkriya body-worthy Pudgals, and until he completes the Bainkriya body's paryapti, his Audarik Kayayoga has friendship with the Vaikriya body, but in practice, one should consider the Audarik as the primary, because it is the dominant one. Similarly, one should know that there is a mixture of Audarik Kayayoga with the Aharak body at the time of its formation.

The meaning of the Siddhanta's statement is that the Audarik is mixed with the Bainkriya and Aharak at the time of their beginning, hence it is called Audarik-Mishra. When the said body is formed after Bainkriya Labdhi and Aharak Labdhi, it is present in the Audarik body yoga. Until the body paryapti is complete in the Vaikriya body or the Aharak body, there is a mixture. However, since the Audarik is the main one, the designation is Audarik-Mishra. That is, while doing Vaikriya and Aharak, it is called Audarik-Mith.

There is a distinction between Vaikriyamiśra and Āhārakamiśra in the sequence of the time of abandonment. But the Karmagranthakāra believe that any body can perform Kāyayoga, but the Audārik body is Anmasiddha and the Vaikriya and Āhārak are Labdhijanaya. Therefore, considering the predominance of the Labdhijanaya body, Vaikriyamiśra and Āhārakamiśra should be practiced at the time of beginning and abandonment, not Audārikamiśra.
The scholars of the Karmagranth who consider four Gunasthanas in Audārikamiśra Kāyayoga seem to mean that the Yoga that occurs with the cooperation of both the Kāmaṇ body and the Audārik body should be called Audārikamiśra Kāyayoga, which can be found only in the first, second, fourteenth and thirteenth Gunasthanas. But the intention of the Saiddhantikas is that just as Audārikamiśrata is considered with the Kāmaṇ body, in the same way, Audārikamiśra Kāyayoga should be considered by considering the friendship of the Labdhijanaya Vaikriya and Āhārak bodies.
The above viewpoint of the Siddhanta is also worth accepting and from that perspective, the fifth and sixth Gunasthanas can be considered in Audārikamiśra Kāyayoga. But, here Bandhasvāmitva is being explained according to the Karmagranthas, therefore, the consideration of Bandhasvāmitva related to the fifth and sixth Gunasthanas has not been done.
After stating the Bandhasvāmitva of Audārikamiśra Kāyayoga, now we explain the Bandhasvāmitva of Kāmaṇ Kāyayoga.
Kāmaṇ Kāyayoga occurs during the interval of Antaralmati while going for Bhavantera and at the first time of taking birth. The first, second, fourth and thirteenth Gunasthanas are of the beings who have Kāmaṇ Kāyayoga. Of these, the thirteenth Gunasthan is of the Sayogikevali Bhagavan in the third, fourth and fifth times of Kevali Samudghāt and

Page #89:
---------------------------
## The Third Karma-Vatma

The remaining three Gunasthana occur in the interval between other beings, at the time of death, and at the time of the first birth.

This Karman Kayayog Margna should be understood as having the same Bandhaswamitva as the Audarik Mishra Kayayog at the time of the general S and Musthana. However, there is a special feature in this, that neither Tiryanchay and Manughayau can be bound in it. That is, in the Bandhadhikar of the second Karmagranth, where 120 Prakruti are said to be bindable, in the Audarik Mishra Kayayog Margna, by reducing Aharak Sharira, Aharak Ango Pang, Vayu, Narakgati, Narakanupurvi and Narakayu, these 6 Prakruti, the binding of 114 Prakruti is mentioned. But in Karman Kayayog, along with the aforementioned six Prakruti, by further reducing Tiryanchay and Manuthyathu, the binding of 112 Prakruti occurs in general.

In the Mithyatva Gunasthana, out of the aforementioned 112 Prakruti, like the Audarik Mishra Kayayog, without the five Prakruti like Tirthankar Namakarma, 107 remain. And out of these 107 Prakruti, in the second Gunasthana, by reducing 13 Prakruti like Sukshmatrik, 64 remain. And out of these 64 Prakruti, by reducing 24 Prakruti like Anantanubandhi Krodh, and adding five Prakruti like Tirthankar Namakarma, in the fourth Gunasthana, the binding of 75 Prakruti occurs. And in the thirteenth Gunasthana, only one Sasavedaniya Karma Prakruti remains bound.

Although Karman Kayayog Bandhaswamitva is said to be similar to Audarik Mishra Kayayog, and in the fourth Gunasthana, by taking the binding of 75 Prakruti in Audarik Mishra Kayayog, the binding of 70 Prakruti is supported. But in Karman Kayayog, at the time of the fourth Gunasthana, there is no need to doubt this, because Audarik Mishra Kayayog only occurs in humans and Tiryanchas, but the beneficiaries of Karman Kayayog are humans and Tiryanchas, in addition to Devas and Narakas, who are Manushyathik...

Page #90:
---------------------------
## Bandhasvamitva

The five primordial substances bind. This is why the five substances are also included in the fourth *gunasthan* of *karman* *kayayog*.

*Aharak* *kayayognik*, meaning *Aharak* *kayayog* and *Aharakmishn* *kayayog*, are both found in the sixth *gunasthan*. Therefore, in both these *yog* paths, there is a binding of 63 substances, similar to the sixth *gunasthan*.

In *Aharak* *kayayog*, there are two *gunasthanas*: *pramat* and *apramat* *virat*. When the fourteen *purvadhari* perform *Aharak* body, they are *pramat* due to the use of *labdhi*. This is the sixth *gunasthan*. At that time, when they begin the *Aharak* body, they are mixed with *oudarik*. This means that the sixth *gunasthan* exists in both *Aharakmishr* and *Aharak* *yogas*. However, later, with the power of *vishuddhi*, they come to the seventh *gunasthan*, and then it is only *Aharak* *yog*. This means that in *Aharak* *yog*, there are two *gunasthanas*: the sixth and the seventh. In *Aharakmishr* *kayayog*, there is only the sixth *gunasthan*. Therefore, in the sixth *gunasthan*, there is a binding of 63 substances. Of these substances, when the six substances of *shok*, *arati*, *asthir* *dvik*, *ayash* *kiiti*, and *asata* *vedaniya* are reduced, there is a binding of 57 substances in the seventh. If *devayu* is also bound, then there is a binding of 56 substances. In the 146th verse of *Panchasangrah* *Sapttatika*, it is stated that *Aharak* *yog* and *Aharakmishn* *kayayog* bind 57 and 63 substances respectively. This means that *Aharak* *kayayog* binds 63 substances in the sixth *gunasthan* and 57 in the seventh, while *Aharakmishn* *kayayog* binds 63 substances in the sixth *gunasthan*.

As it is considered in this *karmagranth*, so is the ancient *bandhasvamitva*.

The Third Karma Granth
In the Aharak Kayayogdik, the sixth Gunasthan, the Maman Bandhamnaminya Marata is mentioned, and...
"Taharage Jaha Masas"
- Shabin Badhaswamitva. Ma 42. However, Nemichandracharya in his Sansch Yommmatmar Karmakand, while accepting the 63 Prakruti Bandha in the Aharak Kayayog in the sixth Gunasthan, does not accept the Bandha of Devayu in the Aharak Kayayog. According to him, there are 62 Prakruti Bandha... "Chharga Bahare Lambhiyo Sthi Devau".
...Gi. Karma Ka Ma 118. Meaning, in the Aharak Kayayog, there is Bandhaprasswamitva similar to the sixth Gunasthan, but there is no Bandha of Vayu in the Aharak Kayayog.
The summary is that according to the Karma Granth, in the Aharak Kayayog, in the fourth Gunasthan, there is Bandha of 5 Prakruti, while according to Mihanta, there is Bandha of 90 Prakruti. And in the Siddhant, while using the Jidwarika and Haraklabdhi, the Jidwarika is also considered, but its Vivaksha is not mentioned here because the Kamadhyakara does not accept it, therefore, the Bandha of the fifth and sixth Gunasthan is not mentioned. In the Siddhant, the Bandha of 12 Prakruti is mentioned, in which the words "Banyag Bimayi" etc. mentioned in the Geya, are considered to be other Prakruti, there is no doubt in the opinion of the Karma Granth and Siddhant. In this way, from the 4 Prakruti eligible for Bandha in the second Gunasthan, 24 Prakruti like Anatanubandhi Chatushk etc. and 5 other Prakruti are reduced, and by adding the Tirthankaranama Karma Panchak Prakruti, the total becomes 70 Prakruti.

---------------------------
**Vāsvamisva**

In Kārmāṇa Kāyayoga, bondage should be understood as similar to Audārika Miśrayoga, but in the case of Tiryaṅvāyu and Manuṣyāyu, these two natures should be considered as having bondage of 112 natures less than the general. And in terms of Guṇasthānas, in Mithyātva Guṇasthāna, there is bondage of 177, in the second, 14, in the fourteenth, 75, and in the thirteenth, 1 Sātavēdaniya.

In Āhārak Kāyayoga, bondage should be understood as similar to Guṇasthāna. That is, just as there are 13 natures in the sixth Guṇasthāna, so it should be understood in this yoga. In another opinion, bondage of 63.47 natures has also been said. Some Ācāryas have considered bondage of 62 natures in Āhārakamith Kāyayoga.

Thus, after explaining the bondage in Audārika, Kārmāṇa, and Āhārak Kāyayoga, in the next verse, we explain the bondage in Vaikriya Kāyayoga, Veda, and Kṣaya Mārgāṇa, in the infinite-bound, non-rejectable, and rejectable Kṣaya distinctions.

**Verse 16:**

**Gāthārtha:** In Vaikriya Kāyayoga, bondage should be understood as similar to Devamati, and in Vaikriyamiṭra Kāyayoga, bondage of other natures except Tiryaṅvāyu and Manuṣyāyu should be understood as similar to Vaikriya Kāyayoga, and in Veda and Kṣaya Mārgāṇa, bondage should be understood as follows: in Veda Mārgāṇa, nine from the beginning, in infinite-bound Kṣaya, two from the beginning, in the second, non-rejectable Kṣaya, twelve from the beginning, and in the third, rejectable Kṣaya, five from the beginning, like the Guṇasthānas.

**Viśeṣa:** In the above, the bondage in Vaikriya Kāyayoga and Vaikriyamiṭra Kāyayoga, or in Veda and Kṣaya Mārgāṇa, in the infinite-bound, non-rejectable, and rejectable Kṣaya, has been explained.

The officials after rape are gods and hell beings. Because gods and hell beings are born from the womb. Those born have a physical body. Therefore, their qualities are considered similar to the path of gods and their ownership is also similar to the path of gods, i.e., 104 in general, 103 in the first quality, 66 in the second, 90 in the third and 32 in the fourth.

The owners of aftaar aata are also gods and hell beings like the Vayikayoga. Therefore, in this yoga also, there should be bondage similar to the path of gods. But it should be understood that in this yoga, the bondage of age is impossible. Because this yoga is of gods and hell beings only in the incomplete state. Gods and hell beings in the complete state, i.e., when six months of potatoes remain, they bind the age related to the future. Therefore, in the Vaikriyamishra Kayayoga, except for the lifespan of animals and humans, all other qualities should be considered similar to the Akriya Kayayoga (path of gods).

One more special feature should be understood in the Vaikriyamishra Kayayoga compared to the Vaikriya Kayayoga, that in the Vaikriya Kayayoga there are four quality places in the beginning, while in the Vaikriyamishra Kayayoga there are only three quality places, the first, second and fourth. Because this yoga is in the incomplete state. Therefore, there are more quality places in it.

It is impossible. In the same way, in ancient bondage, even in the case of *micche sasane* or *avisyasammi*, the *ab mahiyan anti* is tested by *sesekkarasane* *mis* meaning - when a living being dies and goes to the next world, they are then in the first, second, or *gunasthan*, but except for these three, no living being attains the remaining eleven *gunasthanas* for the next world. Therefore, in general, 102 should be understood in the first *gunasthan*, 101 in the second, 64 in the third, and 71 in the fourth *gunasthan*. *Vaikriya kayayog* is also born from attainment. As in the fifth *gunasthan*, the present *Ambar parivrajaka* etc., and in the sixth *gunasthan*, the present *Vishnukumar* etc. *munis* have attained *vaikriya* bodies by the power of *vaikriya labdhi*. Although it is possible for *vaikriya kayayog* and *vaishramisra kayayog* to occur in the fifth and sixth *gunasthanas*, the reason why the four *gunasthanas* from the first to the fourth are mentioned for living beings with *vaikriya kayayog*, and the first, second, and fourth *gunasthanas* are mentioned for *kriyamishra kayayog*, seems to be that here the natural *bhavapratyay* of *deva* and *naraka* is the desire for *vaikriya* body. Therefore, the first four *gunasthanas* are considered for them. Due to the desire for *vaikriya kayayog* from *labdhipratyay*, there is no desire for more *gunasthanas* for humans and animals. That is, only by taking the *bhavapratyay* *vaikriya* body, the aforementioned four and three *gunasthanas* are mentioned in *vaikriya kayayog* and *kriyamitra kayayog* respectively.

After stating the bondage ownership of the Yoga path in the third Karma section, now they explain the bondage ownership of the Veda and the Kshaya path, which are infinitely connected, non-revocable, and revocable Kshaya distinctions.

There are three types of Veda: Purusha Veda, Stri Veda, and Namaka Veda. All three types of Veda arise only up to the ninth Gunasthan. That is, the Veda arises only up to the ninth Gunasthan, so the bondage ownership of the Veda should be considered like the bondage authority, like the nine Gunasthanas. That is, just as in the bondage authority, there are 120 in general, 117 in the first Gunasthan, 101 in the second, 74 in the third, 77 in the fourth, 17 in the fifth, 63 in the sixth, 56-58 in the seventh, 58, 56, and 26 in the eighth, and 22 in the ninth, the bondage ownership of the beings on the Veda path should be understood in the same way.

The Anantanubandhi Kshaya arises only in the first and second Gunasthanas. Therefore, only these two Gunasthanas are considered as the Guruasthanas in this Kshaya. At the time of these two Gunasthanas, there is neither Samyaktva nor Charitra. Therefore, Tirtharanama Karma (whose bondage is only from Samyaktva) and Aharakdvik (whose bondage is only from Charitra), these three natures are prohibited in the general bondage of those with Anantanubandhi Kshaya. Therefore, those with Anantanubandhi Kshaya bind 117 natures from general and 101 in the first Gunasthan.

The Apratyakhyanavaran Kshaya, like anger, arises up to the first four Gunasthanas. Therefore, there are four Gunasthanas in these. At the time of these Kshayas, since Samyaktva is possible, the bondage of Tirthakarama can occur. But since there is no Charitra, the bondage of Aharakdvik does not occur. Therefore, in these Kshayas, there are 118 from general and

## Bandhasvamitva

**It should be understood that in the first Gunasthan, there are 117, in the second 101, in the third 74, and in the fourth 557 Prakṛtis bound.**

**The emergence of Kṣayās, Pratyakhyānavarana, occurs up to the fifth Gunasthan. Therefore, from the first to the fifth Gunasthan, they are considered Paṇi Gunasthan.**

**Although there is no Bandha of Āhārakarma due to the absence of Sarvaviratī Cāriś in these Kṣayās, Bandha of Tīrthaṅkara Nāmakarma can occur due to Samyaktva. Therefore, generally, 118 and in the first Gunasthan 114, in the second 101, in the third 14, in the fourth 77, and in the fifth 167 Prakṛtis are bound.**

**In Kṣayāmārgaṇā, it is not stated separately for each, from Anantānubandhī to Sañcalamaparayant, in terms of Bandhasvamitva. However, if the Gunasthan is stated in the general categories of Māna, Māyā, and Lobha, then in the case of Krodha, Māna, and Māyā, the three Kṣayās remain up to the second, third, and fourth parts of the ninth Gunasthan respectively, and the Kṣayā Lobha remains up to the tenth Gunasthan. If the Gunasthan is considered in this way, then in Kṣayāmārgaṇā, there are ten Gunasthan from the first to the tenth, and their Bandhasvamitva should be understood according to Bandhādhīkāra.**

**However, the author has stated their Bandhasvamitva in the Gunasthan in Kṣayāmārgaṇā in relation to Anantānubandhī etc. The summary is that in Vaikriya Kāyayoga, Bandhasvamitva is similar to Devagati, i.e., 104 in general and in the Gunasthan, 103 in the first, 93 in the second, 5 in the third, and 72 in the fourth Prakṛtis. In Vaikriya Mithya Kāyayoga, there is no Bandha of the two Prakṛtis, Tiryañcāyu and Manuṣyāyu, so the remaining Prakṛtis should be understood as bound in the same way as in Vaikriya Kāyayoga. This means that in Kriya Mithya Yoga, there are 102 Prakṛtis that are eligible for Bandha in general, and this Yoga...**

## Third Karma Granth

The third Gunasthan does not exist in the state of *aparayaapt*. Therefore, in the first Gunasthan, 101, in the second 16, and in the fourth 72 *prakritis* are bound.

The emergence of *veb* occurs until the ninth Gunasthan. Therefore, one should understand according to the *bandhadhikar* as mentioned, and according to the binding of *prakritis* mentioned until the ninth Gunasthan.

In *kashayamargna*, the *anantaanubandhi* *kashay* emerges until the first and second Gunasthan. Therefore, in relation to the Gunasthan, the binding is the same as the binding mentioned in *bandhadhikar*, but instead of 120, there is a binding of 117, because this *kay* holder does not have *samyakkarma* and *charitra*, so there is no loss of *tirthankaranam* and *aaharadvik*.

The *apratyakhyanavaran* *kashay* emerges until the fourth Gunasthan, and during this *kashay*, *samyaktv* is possible, so the binding of *tirthankaranam* can occur. Therefore, there are 118 *prakritis* eligible for binding in general, and in the Gunasthan, one should understand 117, 101, 74, and 77 *prakritis* as per *bandhadhikar*.

The *pratyakhyanavaran* *kashay* emerges until the fifth Gunasthan. Therefore, there are five Gunasthan from the first to the fifth *lak*. While this *kashay* remains, *samyaktv* is possible, but since there is no *sarvavirati* *charitra*, there is no binding of *aaharadvik*, so there is a binding of 118 *prakritis* in general, and in the Gunasthan, there is a binding of 117, 101, 74, 77, and 67 *prakritis* respectively.

Now, further in the *gatha*, we will discuss the binding of the remaining *sanjwalan* *kashay* in *kashayamargna*, and the binding of *sanjam*, *gyan*, and *darshan* *margna*.

Page #98:
---------------------------
In the Sanjwalan Trika (Sanjwalan Krodha, Mana, Maya), there are nine Gunasthanas and the Gaur Sanjana zone has its own places. In Aviriti, there are four, in Agnanasik (Mati-Agnana, Shruta-Agnana, Vibhangashan) there are two or three, and in Achakshudarshan, Chakshudarshan, there are twelve in the beginning and four in the Yathakyatacharitra at the end. Therefore, in the aforementioned Marganas, one should understand the Bandhaswamitva according to the Bandhadhikar, both generally and in the Gunasthanas.

Specifically, in the Kshaya Margna, the final distinction of Sanjwalan Kshaya, among the four distinctions of Krodha, Mana, Maya, and Lobha, there are nine Gunasthanas in Krodha, Mana, and Maya, and ten in Lobha. Therefore, the Bandhaswamitva of these four Kshayas is the same as the Gunasthanas, both generally and specifically. That is, the rise of Sanjwalan Krodha, Mana, and Maya occurs up to the ninth Gunasthan, therefore, their Bandhaswamitva should be understood as described in the Bandhadhikar in relation to the Gunasthanas. That is, generally 120, and in the Gunasthanas, from the first to the ninth, one should understand 117, 101, 74, 177, 67, 63, 56, 58, and 22 Prakritis respectively.

In Sanjwalan Lobha, there are ten Gunasthanas from the first to the tenth, therefore, up to the ninth Gunasthan, one should understand the Bandhaswamitva according to the aforementioned Sanjwalan Trika, and in the tenth Gunasthan, there are 17 Prakritis bound. In the Samyama Margna, along with the distinctions of Samyama like Samayik, etc., the Asamyam-Aviriti, which is the opposite of Samyama, is also considered. Therefore, before explaining the Bandhaswamitva of the distinctions of the Samyama Margna, the Bandhaswamitva in Asamyam Aviriti is mentioned. Aviriti means...

## The Third Karma Granth

This is about the state of Samyaktva being attained but not the observance of Charitra. Therefore, there are four Gunasthanas in the beginning, and in the fourteenth Gunasthan, due to the presence of Samyaktva, the binding of Tirthankara-namakarma is possible, but the binding of Aharak-dvig is not possible because it requires restraint. Therefore, in Aviriti, generally, except for Aharak-dvig, 118, in the first Gunasthan 117, in the second 101, in the third 74, and in the fourth Gunasthan 77, types of binding occur.

In Jnanamargna, both knowledge and ignorance are considered. Among these, there are five types of knowledge: Mati, Shruta, Avadhi, Manahparyaya, and Kevalgyan. Among these, Mati, Shruta, and Avadhigyan are also opposite. That is, there are three types of ignorance: Mati-agyan, Shruta-agyan, and Adhand-agyan. Of these eight types of Jnanamargna, here, the binding of Ashan-trik is explained.

In Ashan-trik, there are two or three Gunasthanas in the beginning. From their general binding, Tirthankara-namakarma and Aharak-dvig, these three types should be reduced. Because the cause of ignorance is Mithyatva, and in these Ashan-trik, Mithyatva is present, so from the general and in the first Gunasthan 117, in the second 101, and in the third 74, types of binding should be understood.

The meaning of Ashan-trik being considered as two or three Gunasthanas is that in the third Gunasthan, the vision of the present being is not completely pure or impure, but it is partly pure and partly impure, and partly mixed with impurity. According to this mixed state, the knowledge of those beings is also considered as mixed - partly in the form of knowledge and partly in the form of ignorance. When there is more purity in it, then due to the increase in the purity of vision and the decrease in impurity, 1 Mati-Shruta-Avadhi-yo-vishay-pashcha.

Tatsvarth-poon, 1932

---------------------------
## Bandhaswamitva

In mixed knowledge (Mishragyan), the amount of knowledge is greater and the amount of ignorance is less. Such beings with mixed knowledge can be counted among Shani beings. However, they are considered Ashani. From this perspective, in the first and second Gunasthanas, the being should be considered Ashani.

But when there is an excess of impurity in the vision, and the amount of ignorance is greater in mixed knowledge, and the amount of knowledge is less due to lack of purity, then that mixed knowledge is considered ignorance, and the mixed Shani beings are counted among ignorant beings. Therefore, at that time, the first, second, and third Gunasthanas should be considered ignorant.

The reason for both these situations is that when a being comes from the Mithyatva Gunasthan to the third Gunasthan, the Mithyatva element is more in the mixed vision, resulting in special impurity. And when it comes to the third Gunasthan after leaving Samyaktva, the Samyaktva element is more in the mixed vision, resulting in special purity. Therefore, two or three Gunasthanas are considered in the Agnanatrika.

Here, the difference of opinion regarding the consideration of two or three Gunasthanas in the Agnanatrika has been presented. The Karmagranthakars consider the Sasvadan as ignorance. In the first Gunasthan, due to the rise of Mithyatva Mohaniya, there is ignorance. And the rest, which is mixed, also has the rise of Mohaniya Karma. Since there is no understanding of the true nature there, many Acharyas consider it as ignorance. Because it is said in Panchasangrah that in the mixed, there is only ignorance mixed with knowledge, not pure knowledge. Here, knowledge is considered in relation to pure Samyaktva. If we consider the one with impure Samyaktva as Shani, then we will have to consider Sasvadan as Shani too. But this is not desirable for the Karmagranthakars, because in the Karmagranth, it is said that Sasvadan is ignorance. In this regard...

There are three karmic states. While many Acharyas believe that there are more Mithyatva-mohaniya pudgalas in the mixed karmic state, leading to more ignorance and less knowledge, and more Samyaktava-mohaniya pudgalas, leading to more knowledge and less ignorance, they still acknowledge a trace of knowledge in the mixed karmic state. Therefore, in the state of ignorance, there are only the first two karmic states. (This statement is made in the commentary of the Jina's teachings.) Thus, according to the authors of the karmic texts, there are two or three karmic states.

The bondage of the state of ignorance in the path of knowledge is explained here. The bondage of the remaining five types of knowledge, namely, Matijnana, etc., will be explained later. Now, we will explain the bondage of the two types of Darshan, namely, Chakshu Darshan and Achakshu Darshan, in the path of Darshan.

**A**

In both Chakshu Darshan and Achakshu Darshan, there are twelve karmic states. This is because both are क्षायोपशमिक (kshayopaśamika) states, and क्षायोपशमिक states exist up to the twelfth karmic state. Therefore, their bondage is the same in general and in each karmic state. That is, just as the bondage is explained as 120 in general and 117 in the first karmic state, and so on, up to the twelfth karmic state, similarly, the bondage should be understood in the Chakshu Darshan and Achakshu Darshan paths.

As is known, the Charitra (conduct) is present in the last four karmic states. Therefore, there are four karmic states from the eleventh to the fourteenth. In the fourteenth karmic state, there is no bondage due to the absence of Yoga. However, in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth karmic states, there is bondage due to the presence of Yoga. Therefore, only one nature, namely, the Saataavedaniya, is bound due to Yoga. Therefore, in this Charitra, one should understand the ownership of this nature in general and in particular.

Page #102:
---------------------------
The summary is that among the four types of Kshaya Margna, namely Sanjwalan Krodha, Mana, Maya and Lobha, Krodha, Mana and Maya remain until the ninth Gunasthan. Therefore, there are nine Gunasthanas from the first to the ninth for these three, and Lobha remains until the tenth Gunasthan. Therefore, their Bandhaswamitva should be understood according to the dreams.

There are four Gunasthanas in the beginning of Avirati, a type of Samyam Margna. In the fourth Gunasthan, due to the presence of Samyaktva, the Bandha of Tirthakur Namakarma is possible, but the Bandha of Aharakdvik is not possible because it is dependent on Samyasa. Therefore, in Avirati, there are 18 types of Bandhas except for Aharakdvik, and in Gunasthanas, there are 101 in the first, 74 in the third, and 77 in the fourth.

In the first, there are 117, and in the second, there are 101 types of Bandhas. In Ajnana Trik, there are two or three Gunasthanas, therefore, from the general Bandha, Tirthakur Namakarma and Aharakdvik, these three types should be reduced. Therefore, from the general and in the first Gunasthan, there are 177, in the second, there are 101, and in the third, there are 74 types of Bandhas.

In Chakshudarshan and Achakshudarshan, there are twelve Gunasthanas in the beginning, and their Bandhaswamitva should be understood as the same as the general and in relation to the Gunasthanas.

In Yathakyat Charitra, there are four final Gunasthanas from the eleventh to the fourteenth, and in the fourteenth Gunasthan, there is no Bandha due to the absence of Yoga, and in the remaining three - eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth - there is only one Bandha of Satavedaniya.

In this way, Sanjwalan Chatushk of Kshaya Margna, Avirati and Yathakyat Charitra of Samyam Margna, and Ajnana of Jnana Margna.

##  The Bondage of Karma in the Path of Knowledge

This passage discusses the bondage of karma in the different stages of the path of knowledge, specifically focusing on the **Manahparyaya** (mental perception) and **Mati** (intellectual) knowledge. It also mentions the **Samyama** (restraint) and **Shana** (spiritual power) paths, and their respective stages of bondage.

The passage begins by stating that the bondage of karma is discussed in the previous verses, specifically in the context of the **Trika** (threefold path) and the **Darshanmarg** (path of vision). It then moves on to explain the bondage of karma in the **Samyamamarg** and **Shanamarg**, highlighting the different stages of **Matijnana** (intellectual knowledge) and other types of knowledge.

**Verse 18** states: "All victories are achieved through time, and only through restraint can one overcome them. Only in the **Kevalidvik** (two-fold path of liberation) are there no more obstacles."

**Explanation:**

* **Manahparyaya Jnana:** This stage of knowledge encompasses seven **Gunasthanas** (stages of spiritual development), from **Pramattasanyata** (controlled by passions) to **Kshaya Kshaya** (destruction of passions). While **Manahparyaya Jnana** arises in the seventh **Gunasthan**, a monk can still fall back into the sixth **Gunasthan** due to carelessness. Those who possess this knowledge do not remain in the first five **Gunasthanas** (Mithyatva, etc.), as they are free from the **Kshayas** (passions). However, they do not remain in the last two **Gunasthanas** (thirteenth and fourteenth), as it is impossible to be free from passions while still experiencing them. Therefore, **Manahparyaya Jnana** is considered to exist from the sixth to the twelfth **Gunasthanas**.

* **Mati Jnana:** This stage of knowledge encompasses nine **Gunasthanas**, from **Avirat Samyagdristi** (unwavering right faith) to the ninth **Gunasthan**.

* **Samyamamarg:** This path encompasses three types of **Charitra** (conduct): **Samayik** (temporary vows), **Chhedopasthaniya** (partial vows), and **Pariharavishuddhi** (purified conduct). Each of these **Charitra** has its own stages of bondage, with **Pramattasanyata** being the lowest stage.

* **Shanamarg:** This path encompasses the **Avadhi Darshan** (clairvoyance) and **Keval Darshan** (omniscience) stages of **Darshanmarg**.

The passage concludes by stating that the detailed explanation of the bondage of karma in each stage of knowledge is provided in the verses that follow.

**General**

It is possible for the *dvik* of *saaman* to be bound. Therefore, in this knowledge, one should understand the ownership of the binding of 65 *prakritis* in general and the same ownership of binding in each *gunasthan* from the sixth to the twelfth *munasthan*. In other words, in the *manahparyayajnanamargna*, there are 65 *prakritis* in general, and from the sixth to the twelfth *gunasthan*, there are 63 in the sixth, 5658 in the seventh, 585626 in the eighth, 2212112011618 in the ninth, 17 in the tenth, 1 in the eleventh, and 1 in the twelfth.

**Samayik and Chandopastaniy**

These two *sanayam* are found in the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth *munasthan*. During these *sanayam*, it is possible for the *dvik* of *aaharaka* to be bound. Therefore, 65 *prakritis* are capable of being bound in general, and the same binding should be understood in each *gunasthan* from the sixth onwards, in accordance with the *gunasthan*. In other words, there are 63 in the sixth, 56358 in the seventh, 585626 in the eighth, and 221211201618 in the ninth.

**Pariharavishuddhi**

A *sanayami* with *pariharavishuddhi* cannot attain the *munasthan* beyond the seventh *gunasthan*. Therefore, this *sanayam* occurs only in the sixth and seventh *gunasthan*. Although the *dvik* of *aaharaka* does not arise during this *sanayam*, because a *sanayami* with *pariharavishuddhi* does not have complete knowledge of the ten *purva*, and the *dvik* of *aaharaka* can arise only in the *chaturdashapurvadhara*. However, it is possible for the *dvik* of *aaharaka* to be bound. Therefore, the ownership of binding is 65 *prakritis* in general, and the same binding should be understood in each *gunasthan*, in other words, 63 in the sixth *gunasthan* and 56 or 58 in the seventh.

**Kevalahit**

*Kevalahit*, which includes *kevalgyan* and *kevaldarshan*, consists of the thirteenth and fourteenth *gunasthan*. However, in the *bauddh* *munasthan* out of these two *gunasthan*, due to the absence of the causes of binding, no *karmaprakriti* is bound. However, in the thirteenth *gunasthan*...

Page #105:
---------------------------
The karma of the third (Tṛtīya) is mainly present, and that bondage is only of the seven-sense-object (Sātavedanīya). Therefore, in both of these, the bondage-ownership is of the same nature as the general and in comparison to the quality-places (Guṇasthāna). _The knowledge of mind (Matigñāna), the knowledge of scripture (Śrutigñāna), and the knowledge of perception (Avadhi-dvīka-Avadhijñāna and Avadhīdarśana) - these four paths (Mārgaṇā) do not have the first three quality-places (Guṇasthāna) and the last two quality-places. That is, there are nine quality-places from the thought (Vicāra) to the twelfth quality-place of the weakened passions (Kṣīṇakṣayā). The reason for not having the first three quality-places is that these four are considered real when there is right conduct (Samyaktvā), and there is no pure right conduct in the first three quality-places. And the reason for not having the last two quality-places is that they have knowledge of passions (Kṣayika jñāna), not the cessation of passions (Kṣayopashamika). Therefore, in these four, a total of nine quality-places are considered from the fourth to the twelfth quality-place. In these four paths, since the bondage of the two-fold food (Āhārakadvika) is possible, it should be understood that there are 16 natures in general and in comparison to the quality-places, the bondage-ownership is the same as the bondage-authority in each quality-place from the fourth to the twelfth quality-place. That is, in the fourth quality-place, the food body (Āhārak śarīra) and the food limbs (Āhārak angopānga) - these two natures are added to the 77 natures that are bondable in general, resulting in bondage of 76 natures in comparison to the general, and in comparison to the quality-places, 37 in the fourth, 67 in the fifth, 63 in the sixth, 56158 in the seventh, 556126 in the eighth, 2sarś2011618 in the ninth, 17 in the tenth, ? in the eleventh, and in the twelfth, the bondage of nature should be understood.
In summary, in the path of knowledge of mental states (Manaḥparyāya jñānamārgaṇā), there are seven quality-places from the sixth to the twelfth quality-place, and since the bondage of the two-fold food is possible in this, there are 65 natures in general, and in comparison to the quality-places, the bondage should be understood in each quality-place from the sixth to the twelfth quality-place, the same as the bondage-authority.

**Samayika and Chhedopasthaniya** are two types of **Samyama** that occur from the sixth to the ninth **Gunasthanas** (stages of spiritual development). In these, **Aharakaddhik** (external influences) can also lead to **Bandha** (bondage). Therefore, the **Bandhaswamitva** (ownership of bondage) in both is generally 65 **Prakritis** (categories of karma), and the **Bandhadhikar** (right to bondage) is the same in each **Gunasthan** from the sixth to the ninth.

**Parihar Vishuddhi** is a pure **Samyama** and a **Gunasthan**. Although **Aharakaddhik** does not arise during this **Samyama**, **Bandha** is possible. Therefore, its **Bandhaswamitva** is generally 65 **Prakritis**, and specifically, the **Bandhadhikar** is 63 in the sixth **Gunasthan** and 56 or 58 **Prakritis** in the seventh.

**Kevaladwik** - **Kevalgyan** and **Kevaldarshan** - are the last two **Gunasthanas**, the thirteenth and fourteenth. However, in the fourteenth **Gunasthan**, **Bandha** does not occur due to the absence of causes of **Badha** (obstacles). In the thirteenth **Gunasthan**, only one **Sataavedaniya Karma** (karma that can be destroyed in this life) is bound. Therefore, its general and specific **Bandha** is only one **Sataavedaniya** **Prakriti**.

**Matigyan**, **Shrutigyan**, and **Avadhi** - **Avadhigyan** and **Avhidarshan** - are four **Marganas** (paths of knowledge). The first three **Gunasthanas** do not have **Shuddha Samyaktv** (perfect knowledge), and the last two are **Kshayikbhav** (prone to destruction). All four are **Sayopashmik** (prone to external influences). Therefore, they span nine **Gunasthanas** from the fourth to the twelfth. In these four **Marganas**, **Aharakaddhik** can lead to **Bandha**, so the **Bandhaswamitva** should be understood as 76 **Prakritis** generally and the same as the **Bandhadhikar** in each **Gunasthan** from the fourth to the twelfth.

Thus, the **Gyanyamargna** (path of knowledge) includes **Mati**, **Shruti**, **Avadhi**, **Manahparyaya**, and **Kevalgyan**, and the **Darshanamargna** (path of perception) includes **Avhidarshan** and **Kevaldarshan**. The **Samyamamargna** (path of self-control) includes **Samayika**, **Chhedopasthapaniya**, and **Parihar Vishuddhi**.

In the third chapter of Karma, we have already discussed the bondage of the soul in relation to general and specific qualities. Now, in the following verses, we will explain the remaining distinctions between the paths of Right Faith (Samyaktvamargna) and Restraint (Samyamamargna), and the bondage of the soul in the path of Food (Aharakmargna).

**Verse 16:** There are four qualities in the path of Right Faith (Samyaktvamargna) called "Upasham," eleven qualities in the path of Right Faith (Samyaktvamargna) called "Kshayopamik," one quality in the path of False Faith (Mithyatvamargna) called "Mithyatva," one quality in the path of Restraint (Samyamamargna) called "Deshacharitra," and one quality in the path of Restraint (Samyamamargna) called "Sookshma Samparaya." There are thirteen qualities in the path of Food (Aharakmargna). One should understand that the bondage of the soul in each of these paths is equal to the number of qualities in each path.

**Explanation:** This verse explains the bondage of the soul in the paths of Right Faith (Samyaktvamargna) - "Upasham," "Vedak" (Kshayopamik), "Kshayik," "Mithyatva," "Sasvadan," and "Mith," and in the paths of Restraint (Samyamamargna) - "Deshavirat," "Sookshma Samparaya," and "Aharakmargna."

Those who have attained "Upasham" or those who are comparable to the beings with infinite attachments and the three poisons of passions (Kshaya), perception (Darshan), and delusion (Moh), are said to have attained "Upasham Samyaktvam." This "Upasham Samyaktvam" exists in the qualities of "Deshavirati," "Pramattasanyatavirati," or "Aparamattasanyatavirati," except for "Avirat Samyaktvam." Similarly, this "Upasham" category exists in the beings who are in the eighth to eleventh qualities. Therefore, in this "Samyaktvam," there are a total of eight qualities from the fourth to the eleventh qualities.

During this "Samyaktvam," there is no bondage of lifespan. In the fourth quality, there is no bondage of either divine lifespan or human lifespan. In the fifth and subsequent qualities, there is no bondage of divine lifespan.

Therefore, in this Samyaktv, generally 75 Prakṛtis are bound, in the plant Guṇasthāna 75, in the fifth 66, in the sixth 62, in the seventh 58, in the eighth 585626, in the ninth 22021120.16.18, in the tenth 17, and in the eleventh Guṇasthāna 1 Prakṛti is said to be bound.

Vedakasamyaktv is also called Kṣayopamika Samyaktv. Kṣayopamika Samyaktv destroys the arising of Mithyatva and pacifies the non-arising. Therefore, it is called Kṣayopamika Samyaktv. This Samyaktv occurs in four Guṇasthānas from the fourth to the seventh. In this, the binding of Āhāravik also occurs, generally 79 Prakṛtis are bound, and specifically, in comparison to the Muṇasthāna, in the fourth Guṇasthāna 77, in the fifth 67, in the sixth 63, and in the seventh 56 or 58 Prakṛtis are bound. After that, the series begins. Therefore, in the Upasama series, there is Upasama Samyaktv, and in the Kṣapaka series, there is Kṣayika Samyaktv.

The special characteristic of Aupaśamika and Kṣayopamika Samyaktv is that Kṣayopamika Samyaktv experiences the arising of the region of Mithyatva-mohaniya, and Upasama Samyaktv does not experience either the arising of the result or the arising of the region. In Kṣayopamika Samyaktv, there are Pudgalas of Mithyatva-mohaniya, therefore it is called Vedaka. In summary, in Aupaśamika Samyaktv, there is no experience of the result of the particles of Mithyatva, nor from the region. But in Kṣayopamika Samyaktv, there is experience in comparison to the region.

From the destruction of all three types of Darśana-mohaniya Karma, which are the causes of the world, there is Kṣayika Samyaktv. In this Samyaktv, there are eleven Guṇasthānas from the fourth to the fourteenth. In this, the binding of Āhāraka-dvik can occur. Therefore, generally, its binding is of 79 Prakṛtis, and in comparison to the Guṇasthānas, it is the same in each Guṇasthāna. That is, in Avirata 77, in Deśavira

That is, the first *Gunasthan* is *Mithyatva*, the second is *Sasvadan*, and the third is *Mishra*. Therefore, the general and specific bondage ownership of these three should be understood as the same as the bondage ownership of these *Gunasthan*. That is, generally and specifically, *Mithyatva* has 117 *Prakriti* bondage ownership, *Sasvadan* has 101, and *Mishra Gunasthan* has 74.

*Deshavirata* and *Sookshma Samparaya* are two divisions of *Sanayama Marg*. Each of these two *Sanayama* has a *Gunasthan* named after it. That is, *Deshavirati Sanayama* is only in the fifth *Gunasthan*, and *Sookshma Samparaya* is only in the tenth *Gunasthan*. Therefore, the bondage ownership of these two is also the same as the bondage ownership of their respective *Gunasthan*.

## Third Karma

In the third karma, the bondage should be understood in the same way as the bondage in the fourth to the alega, in comparison to the Gunasthanas.

1. Mithyatva, Sasvadan, and Misra - these three are also divisions of the Samyaktvamargna, and each has a Gunasthan with its own name. Therefore, the general and specific bondage of these three should be understood as being in the Gunasthan with its own name, along with its Uma.

In the Samyammargna, there is one Gunasthan with its own name for each of Deshaviriti and Sukshmaparaya Samyama, i.e., the tenth Gunasthan called Deshaviriti in Deshaviriti and the tenth Gunasthan called Sukshmasamparaya in Sukshmaparaya. Therefore, the bondage of these two should also be understood in the same way as these Gunasthanas, both generally and specifically.

In the Aharakmargna, all worldly beings are included until Moksha is attained. Therefore, this Margna has thirteen Gunasthanas from the first to the thirteenth. In this Margna, the bondage should be understood in the same way as the general and the specific bondage in each Gunasthan.

Thus, after stating the bondage in the general and specific aspects of some divisions of the Samyaktvamargna and the Samyammargna, and in the Aharakmargna, we now describe the characteristics of the division of the Samyaktvamargna, Upshama Samyaktv, in the following verse:

**Verse 20:**

**Meaning:** In Upshama Samyaktv, the present beings do not bind themselves with the Ayubandha. Therefore, in the Ayat Avirat Samyagdristi Gunasthan, bondage occurs in other natures except for the Devayus and Manushayus, and...

Page #112:
---------------------------
Swami,
In the Gunasthanas of Deshaviriti etc., there is bondage of other self-worthy actions without Devayau.
- In the previous verse, the bondage-ownership in the Upasham, Kshayopavan and Kshayik divisions of Samyak Margana has been explained. In them, eight Gunasthanas from the fourth to the eleventh of Asara have been explained and bondage-ownership has been done in comparison to the general and Gunasthanas. But there is a special feature in Samyak that there are no such present-day living beings in it, which can bind the age. Because Upasham Samyaktva is of two types - (1) Granthibhedjanaya and (2) Upasham category. Of these, Granthibhedjanaya Upasham Samyak is for the Anadi Mithyatva living being and the Upasham category is in the eighth to eleventh, these four Gunasthanas.
Of the above two types, the bondage of age is prohibited in the Gunasthanas related to the Upasham category. Because age bondage happens up to the seventh Gunasthana, not beyond that.
Granthibhedjanaya Upasham Samyaktva happens from the fourth to the seventh Gunasthana. But in these Gunasthanas, the Aupashamik Samyakvi age

In the present living being, none of the four does not bind the age of the Avirat Samyadrishti living being. Therefore, Aupamik Avirat Samyadrishti does not bind Devayau and Manushayau, and they do not bind Devayau in Deshaviriti etc.

Page #113:
---------------------------
The third karma-praaya cannot bind. Because the binding of kshaya, which is infinite, its arising, the binding of life, and death, these four actions can be experienced by the samyavasi, but none of these actions can be experienced by the upshama samyadrishti. Therefore, at the time of upshama samyaktva, there are no results that are fit for binding of life. Therefore, in the fourth gunasthan, which is fit for upshama samyaktva, the upam sammadrishti is denied the two lives of deva-ayu and manushya-ayu because in that, the binding of these two lives is possible, but the binding of other lives is not possible because in the fourth gunasthan, the present deva and naraka manushya-ayu can only bind the deva-ayu of the tiryanch and manushya, and the manushya deva-ayu. Therefore, in the general binding authority, where the binding of 77 prakritis is mentioned in the fourth gunasthan, in its place, the upshama sammadrishti binds 75 prakritis.

In the binding of the fifth and subsequent gunasthanas of the upshama samyagdristi, only the deva-ayu has been left out. The reason for this is that in those gunasthanas, only the binding of deva-ayu is possible. Because the fifth gunasthan is possessed by the tiryanch and manushya, and the sixth and seventh gunasthanas are possessed by the manushya, who can only bind the deva-ayu. The manushya-ayu has already been reduced from the general binding. Therefore, in the deshavirat of the upshama samyagdristi, there is binding of 66 prakritis, in the pramattavirat, there is binding of 62 prakritis, and in the apramattavirat, there is binding of 58 prakritis.

In summary, the upshama samyaktva is of two types: adhibhedajanaya and upshama shrenipata. Of these, the adhibhedajanaya upshama samyaktva has eight gunasthanas from the fourth to the seventh, and the shrenipata has eight gunasthanas from the eighth to the eleventh. Of these, the upshama shrenipata...

Page #114:
---------------------------
In the **Gunasthanas**, there is no **Ayubandha**. Because **Apubandha** and its associated **Adhyavasyas** only exist up to the **Sasva** **Gunasthanas**. And even in these **Gunasthanas**, there are no such **Adhyavasyas** that could lead to **Ayubandha**. Therefore, from the first to the seventh **Gunasthanas**, instead of considering the same **Bandha** as **Bandhadhikar**, one should understand that there are 75 **Prakritis** bound in the fourth, 66 in the fifth, 62 in the sixth, and 58 in the seventh.

After explaining the characteristics of **Upshama Samyaktvam** related to **Samyaktvamargna**, the next two verses explain the **Bandhasvamitva** of **Lenyamargna**.

**Verse 21:**  **Ahtarasayam Aharadamana Aile Sati. Tam Titthonam Minche Sanai Sasvahi Oho.**

**Verse 22:** **Teu Naravanavana Ujoyachar Narayavar Vin Sukka. Vinu Naramvara Pamha Ajinaahara Ima Minche.**

**Verse Meaning:**

The general **Bandhasvamitva** of 118 **Prakritis**, excluding the **Aharakaddhik**, is in the three **Leshyas** of **Krishna**, **Neela**, and **Kapoot**. Among them, in the **Mithyaral Gunasthanas**, the **Tirthakar Prakruti** is less, and in the three **Gunasthanas** of **Sasvadan** etc., one should understand the **Bandhasvamitva** as similar to **Bandhadhikar**.

The **Bandhasvamitva** of **Tejoleshya** is for all **Prakritis** except **Narakanavaka**. The **Bandha** of all **Prakritis** except the **Udyotchaturshka** and **Narakadwadash** (total 16 **Prakritis**) is in **Shuklaleshya**. And in **Paleshya**, the **Bandha** is for all **Prakritis** except the aforementioned **Narakadwadash**.

In the **Mithyatva Gunasthanas**, the **Bandhasvamitva** of **Tej** etc. in the aforementioned three **Leshyas** should be understood as excluding the **Tirthakar** and **Aharakaddhik**.

**Special Meaning:** These two verses explain the **Bandhasvamitva** of **Leyamarg**. There are six types of **Leshyas**: (1) **Krishna**, (2) **Neela**, (3) **Kapoot**, (4) **Tej**, (5) **Padam**, and (6) **Shukla**. **Krishna** etc. are included in **Yoga**.

Page #115:
---------------------------
## Third Karma Grantha

The auspicious and inauspicious results of the soul in relation to the substance are called **Leshyas**. **Kashaya** are their collaborators. As the intensity of **Kashaya** increases, the **Leshyas** become more and more inauspicious. As the **Kashaya** become milder, the **Leshyas** become more and more pure. For example, when the **Kashaya** that is bound to the soul arises with the greatest intensity, it is **Krishna Leshya**, and when it arises with mild intensity, it is **Shukla Leshya**.

Sometimes, the color of the bodies of Devas and Narakas are considered **Leshyas**. This is because their **Leshyas** are based on their state of being. **Samyaktv** (perfect knowledge) is considered to be achieved through **Leshyas**. In this context, **Krishna Leshya** is also considered in relation to the substance, and **Samyaktv** is achieved only through auspicious **Leshyas**. If this is the case, how can a being residing in **Krishna Leshya** achieve **Samyaktv**? To explain this, it is believed that **Leshyas** related to the substance are the color of the body, but **Leshyas** related to the mind can also be present in them. At the time of achieving **Samyaktv** by the Narakas of the seventh hell, there is pure **Bhavaleśya** (mental Leshya), but from the substance, there is **Krishna Leshya**, which means it is like **Tejo Leshya** (Leshya of light) in a reflected form.

The implication is that the **Leshyas** of Devas and Narakas are based on their state of being, but the **Leshyas** related to the substance are the color of the body, and the **Leshyas** related to the mind are based on the state of mind at that time.

Here, it is worth considering that in the third **Karma Grantha**, there are three **Leshyas** - **Krishna**, **Neel**, and **Kapot**, and in the fourth **Karma Grantha**, there are six **Leshyas** mentioned in **Padmapratisas** (verse 233). The solution to this is that those who have already attained the fifth and sixth **Gunasthanas** (stages of spiritual progress) can have the three **Leshyas** of **Krishna**, **Neel**, and **Kapot**, but those who have the three **Leshyas** of **Krishna**, **Neel**, and **Kapot** cannot attain the fifth and sixth **Gunasthanas**. Therefore, from this perspective, there are four...

---------------------------
## Ownership of Karma

There is no contradiction in the six stages of spiritual progress (gunasthana) being present in the Krishna, Adi, and Sina Leshya. For example:

"Sammal Su Savar Lai, Suddis Si Hay Dharri."

"Pughn Divam Ao Push Ann Pia 3 Lesa Ae."

Samyakdrav Shruta is present in all Leshyas, and Charitra is attained in three auspicious Leshyas - Teja, Pam, and Shakl.  Furthermore, those who have attained the previous stages (Samyaktvad, Samayik, Shruta Samayik, Deshabirati Samayik, Savirati Charitra Samayik) can be found in any of the six Leshyas.

The aforementioned Krishna, Adi, and Sina Leshyas, which are three Leshyas, do not experience the bondage of Aharakaddhik karma. This is because the bondage of Aharakaddhik karma does not occur in any of the stages of spiritual progress except the seventh. The aforementioned Krishna, Adi, and Sina Leshyas, at most, reach the sixth stage of spiritual progress. Therefore, their bondage of 118 karmic types is considered as follows:

* In the first stage, 117 karmic types are bound, excluding the Tirthankara karma.
* In the second stage, 101 karmic types are bound.
* In the third stage, 74 karmic types are bound.
* In the fourth stage, 77 karmic types are bound.

The ownership of 77 karmic types in the fourth stage of spiritual progress for the Krishna, Adi, and Sina Leshyas is considered according to the statement "Sanais Sahi Oho." This is also mentioned in the ancient texts on karma.

"Suranar Madayas Sahiya Avirya Sammad Hoti Yaya.
Tisthaparena Juya: Saha Teule Se Param Boccham."

This excerpt clearly states that the 77 karmic types in the fourth stage of spiritual progress for the Krishna, Adi, and Sina Leshyas include the lifespan of a deva (god) just like the lifespan of a human. Similarly, in the Gommatasar Karmakand, the ownership of karma for all types of karma, from Vedmarggana to Aharakmarggana, is described in terms of the stages of spiritual progress.

## Third Karma Bandha

**24**

It is said that the fourth quality of the place is the same as the place, and the bondage of 77 natures is clearly considered in the fourth quality.

Thus, the authors of the Karma Grantha, like Krishna, consider the bondage of 77 natures in the fourth quality in three types of births, while there is a difference of opinion in the Siddhanta. The Siddhanta states that the bondage of life, which is said to be in the fourth quality of the three births of Krishna, etc., is possible only for one human being! Because the hellish beings and the gods bind the human life. But humans and animals do not bind the life of the gods! Because the birth should be in the same Leshya in which the life bondage occurs, and the Samyagdrsti only bind the life of the Vaimanika Devas, and there are no Krishna, Neel, and Kapata in the Vaimanika Devas. The Samyagdrsti with impure Lama do not bind the life of the gods. In this regard, the text of 'Bhagavati' Matak 30, Uddeshak 1 is as follows:

"Kanhalessaanam Mante! Khoyya Kiriyaadi Bank Param Paramati Puchha? Goyama! No Ra Imaushyam Pahrenti. Pare Tirikhopiya Parati, Massavadh Pati, No Devaauyam Pakrenti. Akiriya Asaniy Vegayaavavi Ya Saridhi Aauyam Pakrati. Evam Jis Lahsayi Kalesssadi."

"Kanhamesssaanam Ase! Kiriyadhaadi Vishayatirikshonya Ki Raiyaauyam Puchha? Asyma! Po Paramaauyam Parati, No Tiriklonyaajy Pakrenti Bho Manussajy Pak Renti No Dedhaajy Pakati. Akiriyaavadi Agaaniyavaachi Venaiyavadi Samyahyam Pi Pakrenti 1 Jah: Karahassa Evam Bolalesssayi Kauleessadi. .. 'Maha Panchaniyatirimakhonyaanam Vattamya Bforer Evam Massapani Maniabbba.' 1 Vedadaaharoti Ya Sagunaanam Abhogam Tu."

**Ownership**

"O Bhagavan! Do the Kriṣṇaleśyā (rightly-seeing) action-performers bind the hell-life, etc.?" "O Gautama! They do not bind the hell-life, nor the animal-life, they bind the human-life, they do not bind the god-life, and the non-action-performers, etc., the wrongly-seeing, bind all four lives. Similarly, understand for the blue and the pigeon-colored leśyā!"

"O Bhagavan! Do the Kriṣṇaleśyā rightly-seeing five-sensed animals bind the hell-life?" "O Gautama! They do not bind the hell-life, nor the animal-life, nor the human-life, nor the god-life, and the wrongly-seeing bind all four lives. Similarly, understand for the blue and the pigeon-colored leśyā."

"Just as it has been said for the five-sensed animal beings, so also understand for the humans."

Based on the above statement of the principle, Śrī Jīvavijaī and Śrī Jaisomasūrī have raised doubts in their respective commentaries, that the beings with the three leśyā, Kriṣṇā, etc., who are in the fourth stage of the soul, cannot be considered to bind the god-life. Therefore, in the fourth stage of the soul, instead of 77 types of karmas, only 76 types of karmas should be considered, excluding the god-life. This difference has not been resolved anywhere. The commentators have also left it as very difficult to understand. In the Gommatasāra Karmakāṇḍa, this doubt does not even have a place, because there is no insistence on accepting the text of the Bhagavatī. But for the karma-granthikas who accept the Bhagavatī sūtra, this doubt is not negligible.

1. The word "kriyāvādi" means "action-performing rightly-seeing" in the commentary.

Eg
Therefore, regarding the aforementioned doubt, until another authentic solution is found, there should be no objection to accepting this solution: that the classification of Krishna, etc., as three *leya* within the *samyashti*, which is considered as *deva* in nature, is a view based on the *karmagrantha*, not the *siddhant*.
There are differences of opinion between the *karmagrantha* and the *siddhant* on many subjects. Therefore, even in this *karmagrantha*, it is appropriate to resolve the contradiction by accepting that there is a difference of opinion between the *karmagrantha* and the *siddhant* regarding the bondage or non-bondage of the aforementioned *devayau*.
1
Having explained the bondage of the three inauspicious *leshya* - Krishna, Neel Kapoot - we now explain the bondage of the auspicious *leshya* - Teja, Padma, and Shukla.
The *tejo-leshya* is found from the first *mithyatva* *gunasthan* to the seventh *gunasthan*, and the nine natures - *narak-navak*, *narak-gati*, *narak-anupurvi*, *narak-ayu*, *sukshma*, *apar-yapt*, *sadharan-nam*, *dvi-indriya*, *chi-indriya*, and *chatur-indriya* - are bound in the inauspicious *leshya*. Therefore, those who possess the *tejo-leshya* are not bound by these nine natures, and they are not born in those places where these natures arise in *narak-gati*, *sukshma*, *eka-indriya*, and *vikala-indriya*. Therefore, in the *tejo-leshya*, there is bondage of 111 natures in general.

**aratarfara**

It is believed that in the first **guna-sthana**, due to the absence of **tirthankara-karma** and **aahara-kathika** bondage, 3 out of the 111 bondable **prakritis** are reduced, leaving 108 **prakritis**. From the second to the seventh **guna-sthana**, the bondage of **prakritis** is similar to that of **karma**. This means that in the second **guna-sthana**, 101 **prakritis** are bound, in the third 74, in the fourth 77, in the fifth 68, in the sixth 63, and in the seventh 57 or 58 **prakritis** are bound.

Although according to the **gatha**, the bondage of **shukla-leshya** should be mentioned first, for convenience, we will mention the bondage of **padma-leshya** first, which comes after **tejo-leshya** in the sequence.

**Padma-leshya** also has seven **guna-sthana** from the first **mithyatva** **guna-sthana** to the seventh, similar to **tejo-leshya**. However, the difference between **tejo-leshya** and **padma-leshya** is that those with **padma-leshya** do not bind the three **prakritis** of **ekendriya**, **sthavara**, and **apa**, in addition to **naraka-navaka**, unlike those with **tejo-leshya**. This is because those with **tejo-leshya** can be born as **ekendriya**, but those with **padma-leshya** are not born in **naraka** etc. or as **ekendriya**, hence they do not bind these three **prakritis**.

The bondage of **aage cover** is generally 108 **prakritis**, and in the first **guna-sthana**, due to the absence of **tirthankara-karma** and **aahara-kathika** bondage, it is 105. From the second to the seventh **guna-sthana**, the bondage of **prakritis** should be understood to be the same as that of **indriya-adhikarya**. The number of bondable **prakritis** from the second to the seventh **guna-sthana** has been mentioned above.

In **shukla-leshya**, there are thirteen **guna-sthana** from the first to the thirteenth. The difference between **shukla-leshya** and **patha-leshya** is that those with **shukla-leshya** do not bind the twelve **prakritis** of **naraka-gati** etc., which are not bondable.

**61**

Apart from the four Udyota (Udyota Chatushk), the Karma called Udyota, Tiyanchagati, Tiyechaanupurvi and Tiyancha do not bind. Because these Karmas are applicable to the Tiryancha. One with Padmaleshya can be born in those Tiryancha where Udyota Chatushk arises, but one with Shuklaleshya is not born in the places where these Karmas arise. Therefore, the aforementioned 16 Karmas are not binding in Shuklaleshya. Hence, the binding of 104 Karmas is considered in general. And in the Mithyatva Gunasthan, except for the Tirthankara Karma and Aharakdvik, 101 Karmas bind. And in the second Gunasthan, by reducing the four Karmas of Napunsakaved, Hudsansthan, Mithyatva and Sewart Sanhanan from the 101 Karmas binding in the Mithyatva Gunasthan, the binding of 67 Karmas remains. The reason for reducing these four Karmas of Napunsakaved etc. is that these four bind in the presence of Mithyatva, but Mithyatva is absent in the second Gunasthan. From the third to the thirteenth Gunasthan, the binding of Karmas in each Gunasthan should be understood in the same way as explained in Bandhadhikar.

**Title**

The binding of 16 Karmas, including Narakgati and Tiryanchayu, is not considered in the ownership of Shuklaleshya. Therefore, there is a doubt here:

In Tattvarthabhashya, "Potpadmashuklaleshya Dvitriyeshu" (Chapter 4, Sutra 23), "Shesheshus Saskaadi Dhyaservarthasiddha Shuklaleshya" and in Sangrahni, "Kampihihale Santasis Subakalans Huti Sura" (Gatha 175).

In the first two Devalokas, Tejoaleshya, in the three Devalokas, Palaleshya and up to the Sarvarthasiddha of Lantakakalp, Shuklaleshya is mentioned. So, the question arises that if the Devas with Shuklaleshya from Lantakakalp to Sahasrar Kalp are also born in Tiryancha, then why don't they bind the Udyota Chatushk, which is applicable to them? And in the eleventh Gatha of the same text, it is mentioned that the ownership of binding of Anatyadi Devalokas...

**Regarding Bandhaswamitva**

It is said that, in the context of Bandhaswamitva, all beings except the four types of Devas (Udyot Chatushk) of the Amatadi Kalpa, are bound. This means that the four types of Devas of the Sahasrar Kalpa are bound, and here, in the Shuklaleshya Margna, the binding is prohibited. Thus, there is a contradiction between the two statements.

Sri Jivavijayaji and Sri Jaysomasuri have also pointed out this contradiction in their respective arguments.

Similarly, there is a description of this in the Digambara Karma Shastra. In the 112th verse of the Gommatamar Karmakanda, it is said:

"Kappi sthithis na sith sadarasaharamoti tiriyakugam. Siriya oge yi ladi gati sadarachou."

In this verse of the Gommatasar Karmakanda, the Sahasrar Devaloka is mentioned as the limit of Bandhaswamitva, and the Udyot Chatushk is counted in it, similar to the eleventh verse of this Karmagranth. Also, in the 121st verse of the Gommatasar Karmakanda, the Udyot Chatushk is mentioned in the context of Bandhaswamitva of Shuklaleshya.

Therefore, even though the Bandhaswamitva is the same in the Karmagranth and the Gommatasar, there is no contradiction in the Digambara Shastra because:

1. The Tirthankara nature is not bound in the Kalpavamini women.
2. The four natures - Liyank Tik, Tithanchayu, and Udyot - are bound only up to the Shyalarasahasar heaven. These four natures are not bound in the Amatadi Kalpa. Therefore, these four are considered as the Satara Chatushk.
3. Their binding is only up to the Pataryugal.
4. Subake sadarachou, vamatiambarasam cha na asthi.

## Third Chapter

According to the Digambara sect, the **Lantaka** (Lantay) Devaloka is inhabited by **Paleshya** beings. Therefore, based on this Digambara doctrine, it can be said that the calculation of the four types of **Udyota** (Udyotcha-tushk) during the **Bandhaswamitva** (Bandhaswamitva) period of a thousand **Kalpas** (Kalpa) is in relation to **Padmaleshya** beings, not **Shuklaleshya** beings. However, this contradiction cannot be resolved based on the mentions of **Leshya** in Devalokas in texts like **Tattvarthabhashya** and **Sangrahani**. Although **Shri Jivavijayaji** did not write anything about this contradiction in his **Taba**, **Dhi Jarasomasuri** resolved it by stating that it should be believed that **Shuklaleshya** exists in the ninth and subsequent Devalokas. According to this statement, by accepting **Padma** and **Shukla** as the two **Leshyas** in the sixth, seventh, and eighth Devalokas, and only **Shuklaleshya** in the ninth and subsequent Devalokas, the aforementioned contradiction is resolved.

However, a question arises: why is **Shuklaleshya** also mentioned in the sixth, seventh, and eighth Devalokas in **Tattvarthabhashya** and **Sangrahani Sutra**? The solution is that the statement in **Tattvarthabhashya** and **Sangrahani Sutra** is from the perspective of **Bahulata** (majority). This means that **Shuklaleshya** is in the majority in the sixth, seventh, and eighth Devalokas, and therefore, even though **Padmaleshya** is possible, it is not mentioned. In other words, the **Bandhaswamitva** attributed to **Shuklaleshya** beings is in relation to pure **Shuklaleshya**, not **Padmaleshya**. Therefore, by interpreting **Tattvarthabhashya** and **Sangrahani Sutra** liberally, the contradiction can be resolved.

In summary, except for the **Aharakatrika** (Aharakatrika) beings with **Krishna**, **Neela**, and **Kapol** **Leshyas** among the **Krishna** and other **Leshyas**, there are **Garpanaleshya** beings in the **Brahmaloka** and **Lantaka** Devalokas, as well as in the **Shukra**, **Mahashukra**, and **Alarasahara** **Kalpas**.

**Panyamanit**

The **Prakritis** bind and **Mithyatva** in the **Gugunasthan** does not bind the **Tirthankara Prakriti**, so it should be understood that 117 **Prakritis** are bound in the first **Gunasthan**, and the same binding should be understood in the second, third, and fourth **Gunasthan** as well, according to the **Bandhaswamitva**.

At the time of the fourth **Gunasthan**, the binding of 77 **Prakritis** is considered in these three **Leshyas** of **Krishnadi**, which also includes **Devaayu**, which is correct from the perspective of **Karmaandhakara**. But in the **Bhagavati Sutra**, it is stated that **Samyaktv** humans with the three **Leshyas** of **Krishnadi** can bind **Devaayu**, but not other **Aayu**. Thus, the binding of 76 **Prakritis** should be considered. The simple solution to this contradiction is that the inclusion of **Devaayu** in the binding of **Prakritis** for **Samyaktv** with the three **Leshyas** of **Krishnadi** is according to the opinion of **Karmagranthakara**, not according to the **Sandhanthik** opinion.

**Tejoleshya** is found in the first seven **Gunasthanas**, and by not binding the **Narakanavaka** with this **Leshya**, they bind 111 **Prakritis** in general, and in the first **Gunasthan**, it should be understood that 108 **Prakritis** are bound except for **Tirthankara Namakarma** and **Aharakdvik**, and in the second to seventh **Gunasthanas**, the same **Bandhaswamitva** should be understood as the **Bandhadhikar**.

In **Padmaleshya** also, there are seven **Gunasthanas** similar to **Tejoleshya**. But the difference between **Tejoleshya** and **Padmaleshya** is that in **Padmaleshya**, in addition to the **Narakanavaka**, they do not bind the three **Prakritis** of **Ekendriya**, **Sthavar**, and **Atap**. Therefore, the **Bandhaswamitva** of **Padmaleshya** should be understood as 108 **Prakritis** in general, and in the first **Gunasthan**, by subtracting **Tirthankara Namakarma** and **Aharakchik**, it should be understood as 105, and in the second to seventh **Gunasthanas**, the same **Bandhaswamitva** should be understood as the **Bandhadhikar**.

## Third Firmgranth

The third Firmgranth is found from the Sukleshya to the thirteenth Gunasthan. In it, besides the twelve Abandhya Prakṛtis of the Paleshya, the four Udyot Chatushk are also not bound, making a total of sixteen Prakṛtis that are not counted in the general bondage. Therefore, generally, 104 Prakṛtis are bound, and in the Vidhyatvagunasthan, except for the Tirthankar Naamakarma and Aahar, 101 are bound. In the second Gunasthan, by reducing the four of Napunsak Veda, Hudsansthan, Mithyatva, and Seva Sanhanan from 101, the remaining 67 Prakṛtis should be understood to have the same ownership as the Gunasthanas from the third to the thirteenth Gunasthan.

**65.**

After explaining the bondage ownership of the Avatargana, the following verse describes the ownership of the Bhavy, etc., remaining Marggana.

**Verse 23:**

*Savvagunabhavyasannisuoha abhava asannisaminsama. Sasani asannisannisava kammabhangao anahaare.*

**Meaning:**

The Bhavy and Sanjñi Marggana have the same bondage ownership in all Gunasthanas, while the Abhavy and Asanshi have the same bondage ownership as the Mithyatva Gunasthan. In the Sasvadan Gunasthan, the Asanshi have the same bondage ownership as the Sanshi, and the Anaharakamargena have the same ownership as the Karmanayoga.

**Special Note:**

This verse explains the ownership in the different types of Bhavy and Sanjñi Marggana, and the different types of Aahar, including the Anaharakamargena.

The Bhavy and Sanjñi are both entitled to fourteen Gunasthanas. Therefore, their bondage ownership is 120 Prakṛtis in general, and 117 in the Mithyatva Gunasthan compared to the Gunasthanas, and in the Sasvadan Gunasthan...

In the place of 101 etc., one should understand it as being the same as the bondage authority. The description of bondage in the general and quality places has been done in detail in another karma text, therefore it has not been repeated here.
Without the substance mind, there is no feeling mind, such as the non-cognizant. It is stated in the principle that even without the feeling mind of the Kevali Bhagwan, there is a substance mind. ' That is, the Kevali Bhagwan does not have the feeling mind in the form of the mind result arising from the destruction of the knowledge-obscuring karma, but they answer the questions asked by the gods of the Uttar Vimana with the substance mind. Therefore, it happens without and not the mind is up to the fourteenth quality place. In the principle, it has been called no-cognizant-non-cognizant. Here, in the cognizant path, the fourteen quality places have been told considering the substance mind as cognizant.
The first friend-like quality place is the one for the non-liberated beings, and due to not attaining right faith and conduct, the bondage of the Tirthankara-name karma and the food-consuming karma is not possible. Therefore, the non-liberated beings are entitled to the bondage of 117 qualities, excluding the three qualities of Tirthankara-name karma, food-consuming karma, and these three qualities from the general and the first quality place.
The first and second of these two quality places are for the liberated beings. Due to the non-bondage of the Tirthankara-name karma and the food-consuming karma in the general and the first false-faith quality place, there is bondage of 117 qualities, excluding the three qualities. In the second quality place, they are entitled to the bondage of 101 qualities, like the cognizant beings.
In the non-food-consuming path, the karmic body-yoga path should be understood as being the same as the aavarfree antar. This path is the first, second, fourth...

The third karma, *praaya*, is found in the thirteenth and fourteenth of these five *guna sthana*. The first, second, and fourth of these three *guna sthana* occur when the being goes through *vigraha gati* to be born in another place. At that time, for one, two, or three periods, the being does not have a gross body like *oudarik*, etc., and remains in a state of *anahaarak*. In the thirteenth *guna sthana*, during the third, fourth, and fifth periods of *kevali samudghāt*, there is *anahaarak*. In the fourteenth *guna sthana*, due to the cessation (absence) of *yoga*, no kind of food is possible. Therefore, *anahaarak* is considered to be present in these five *guna sthana*.

However, the reason for the statement that *anahaarak* is similar to *karma yoga* in *margana* should be understood as follows: Here, four *guna sthana* are mentioned in relation to *bandha*, because those who are not *yogi* are *avandha* due to the cessation (absence) of *yoga*. The remaining first, second, fourth, and thirteenth *guna sthana* also have a state of *anahaarak* due to the absence of the *bhavadharani* body of the being in *vigraha gati*. And in the thirteenth *guna sthana*, when *kevali samudghāt* occurs, there is a state of *anahaarak* during the third, fourth, and fifth periods. From this perspective, the thirteenth *guna sthana* should be understood. _*Anahaarak* is similar to *karma yoga* in *margana*._ - *Samaya Sara*, 112

Due to ignorance, one should understand the ownership of the 107 Prakṛtis in the first Gunasthāna, 24 in the second, 75 in the fourth, and 1 in the thirteenth.

In the Anaahāraka Mārgṇā, the ownership of Bandha is explained in relation to the general, etc. Its explanation is as follows: Out of the 120 Prakṛtis that are capable of being bound, by reducing the eight Prakṛtis of Ādhārakartṛka Devāyu, Narakaśika, Manuṣyāyu, and Tīca, there are 112 in relation to the general. And by reducing the five Prakṛtis of Jinanāma Devanika and Cakriyādṛka from these, there are 107 Prakṛtis in the first Gunasthāna. And by reducing the thirteen Prakṛtis of Sukṣmatṛka, Viklatṛka, Ekendriyajāti sthāvaranāma, Ālapnāma, Napuṣakaved, Mithyātva-mohaniya, Huṇḍa-samsthāna, and Sevā-samhanana from these 107 Prakṛtis, there are 34 Prakṛtis in the second Sāsvādana Gunasthāna. And by reducing the twenty-four Prakṛtis of Ananta-anubandha-caturṣka, etc., and adding the free Prakṛtis, there are 75 Prakṛtis in the fourth Gunasthāna. And in the Yoga-kevala Gunasthāna, there is the binding of one Sātavēdaniya Prakṛti.

In summary, the same places exist in both the Bhavyā and Aṃśī Mārgṇās. Therefore, one should understand them in relation to the general and the Gunasthānas, as they are bound by their respective rights.

Therefore, the Abhavyā remain in the first Gunasthāna, and their ownership of Bandha is 117 Prakṛtis in the first Gunasthāna, in relation to the general and the Gunasthāna.

The first and second Gunasthānas exist for the Asamjīvas, and in these, the binding of the three Prakṛtis of Tīrthaṅkara-nāmakarma and Āhāraka-vika is not possible. Therefore, there are 117 Prakṛtis in the general and the first Gunasthāna, and 101 Prakṛtis in the second, in relation to the ownership of Bandha.

## Permswar

"The third karma-patya, although it is in the second, fourth, thirteenth, and fourteenth, there are five gunasthana in the state of anaharaka. But in terms of bandha, there are four gunasthana in the anaharaka margana, similar to the first, second, fourth, and thirteenth... because karma bandha is possible only up to that point, and in these, it should be understood as similar to bandha karmayoga, in comparison to the general and gunasthana. From the very general, there are 112, in the first gunasthana, 107, in the second, 14, in the fourth, 5, and in the thirteenth, 1 bandha.

Thus, the movement in the day and night has been explained. Now, in the next gatha, the end of the granth and the gunasthana in the leshya are mentioned...

"Tisu, Dusu, Suikaai guna baḍ sa ter ti samit.
Devind rilihiyam yam ka satyav khoi." ||24|| Gayath... In the first three leshya, there are four gunasthana in the beginning, in the Tanj and Padma, there are seven gunasthana in the beginning, and in the Shukla leshya, there are thirteen gunasthana. Thus, the knowledge of this Bandhaswamitva prakarana, composed by Shri Devendrasur, should be known by knowing the second karmagranth, called 'Kamstak'.

Special points - This gatha indicates the end of the granth and tells about the gunasthana in the halandhama.

The reason for mentioning the gunasthana in the leshya separately is that there is no difference in the number of gunasthana in other margana, as mentioned in the fourth karmagranth, but there is no agreement regarding the leshyamargna. According to the fourth karmagranth, there are six gunasthana in the Krishna, etc., three leshya. But according to this third karmagranth,

**100**

According to the **Badhakamittva** doctrine, there are only four **Gunasthanas** (stages of spiritual progress). This statement of four **Gunasthanas** is according to the **Panchasangraha** and the ancient **Bandhaswamittva** doctrine. The relevant verses of **Panchasangraha** and ancient **Bandhaswamittva** are as follows:

**Panchasangraha 1-30:** "Chassmasu sikshin simuchchaehanga sukkha amogi alessa."

**Ancient Bandhaswamittva, verse 40:** The above views are also supported in **Gommatasar**.

Therefore, in the three **Leshyas** (types of souls) of **Krishna** etc., **Bandhaswamittva** also considers only four **Gunasthanas**. The intention of considering these three **Leshyas** in the first four **Gunasthanas** is that these **Leshyas**, being in the form of inauspicious results, cannot be found in the other **Gunasthanas**.

Out of the three **Leshyas** of **Tej** etc., **Tej** and **Pa** are auspicious, but their auspiciousness is much less than that of **Shukla Leshya**. Therefore, these two **Leshyas** are found up to the seventh **Gunasthanas**, and the nature of **Shukla Leshya** is so auspicious due to the mildness (purity) of its results that it can be found up to the thirteenth **Gunasthanas** (**Sak**).

The general **Bandhaswamittva** of these six **Leshyas** in comparison to the four **Gunasthanas** has been explained in verses 21 and 22. Therefore, one should understand it from there.

**Verse 691, Jiva Kanda:** "Thavarakayappahudu avirksha sammoti amuhti halessa. Sarani do apamalo av du sujhati pipalessaao."

**Meaning:** The first three inauspicious **Leshyas** are from **Thavarakaya** to the fourth **Gunasthanas**, and the last two auspicious **Leshyas** are from **Sanshi Mithyashti** to **Aparamatta**.

## The Third Karma Granth: Bandhasvamitva

This Granth discusses the bondage of souls due to **Marganas** (karmic particles) in relation to **Payana** (the path of liberation). It is essential to study the second Karma Granth before understanding this one, as it deals with **Gunasthanas** (stages of spiritual evolution) and **Prakritibandha** (bondage to the material world), which are relevant to this discussion. This Granth explains how the bondage of a particular **Margana** is similar to the bondage of **Bandha-Dhikara** (karmic tendencies).

This Granth is named **Bandhasvamitva** because it explores the bondage of souls due to their **Margana**-induced capacity for **Prakritibandha**.

Thus ends the third Karma Granth, **Bandhasvamitva**, composed by Shri Devendrasuri.

The Third Karma Granth, **Bandhasvamitva**, is complete.

**Chapter 4, Verse 15, Line 57**

This chapter discusses the ownership of *udaya*, *udirasha*, and *satta* in the context of *marganas*. The third *karmagrantha* mentions the ownership of *bandha* in *marganas* through general and *gunasthanas*, but it does not discuss the ownership of *udaya*, *udirasha*, and *satta*. However, it seems necessary to briefly discuss them for practical purposes. Therefore, an explanation related to them is provided.

**Ownership of *Udaya***

In the *marganas*, there are four *gunasthanas* from *mithyatva* to *aviratsamashti munasthan*. Generally, there are 122 *prakritis* that are capable of *udaya*. Out of these, 17 *prakritis* are *dhruvobhadhi* - they are always *udayavati* in their respective *udaya* realms. These include *jnanavaran*, *darshanavaran*, *antaraya*, *mithyatvamohaneya*, *jasanama*, *karmanama*, *varnapan*, *anuruludhu nama*, *nirmananama*, *sthiranama*, *asthiranama*, *shubhanam*, and *ashubhanam*. The *udaya* realm of *mithyatvamohaneya* is the first *gunasthan*, and it is *dhruvobhadhi* there.

The *udaya* of the five *jnanavaran*, four *darshanavaran*, and five *antaraya* - a total of fourteen *prakritis* - occurs in the twelfth *gunasthan* called *lak*. The *udaya* of the remaining twelve *prakritis* occurs in the eleventh *gunasthan* called *sak*. This is the case for all beings.

These twenty-seven *dhruvobhadhi* *prakritis*, along with *nidra prapala*, *vedaniya vik*, *neech gotra*, *narakatrik*, *patteindriya jati*, *vaishiyatik*, *hundasanasthan*, *ashubhavihayogati*, *paradhat*, *ucchvasanama*, *upghat*, *machatusk*, *durbhag*, *iswar*, *anadesh*, *ayash*, sixteen *kashayas*, *hasyaadishatk*, *napa ved*, *sammatvamohaneya*, and *mishra mohaneya* - a total of 76 *prakritis* - arise in the *udaya* of *narakas* due to *samagam*.

Out of these, the *udaya* of *satyavarnatrik* does not occur in *kriya bhariri deva* and *narakas* according to the *panchasangrah* and *karmaprakriti*. It is said that the lifespan of an *asankhya* years...

**Third Karma Granth: Appendix**

Except for the following: humans, Liyach, those with Vaikriya bodies, those with Aharaka bodies, those with black bodies, and the Anumala Sadhu, the remaining beings experience the rise and fall of Sthana Chitra.

From the 76 Prakruti's that arise from the general, 68 Prakruti's in the Mithyatva Gunasthan, and 72 Prakruti's in the Sasvadan Gunasthan, excluding the Samyakvamohaniya and Misra Mohaniya, are eligible for liberation.  By reducing the Agamlanuvandhi Chatushka and adding Mitra Mohaniya, 66 Prakruti's arise in the Misra Gunasthan.  By reducing the Misra Mohaniya and adding the Sabyakarna Mohaniya and Narakanupurvi, 70 Prakruti's arise in the Aviral Samyashti Gunasthan.

**Tibandigati:** In this fall, there are five Gunasthan's.  In this, the following fifteen Prakruti's do not arise: Devathik, Narakvik, Vaikriyathika, Aharakadvick, Manushyamik, Uchcha Gotra, and Jinnam.  Therefore, by reducing these fifteen Prakruti's from the 122 eligible Prakruti's, 107 Prakruti's arise from the general.  The Tyantr's do not have a Bhavadharniya Vaikriya body, but they do have a Labdhipratyaya Vaikriya body.  Therefore, by adding Vaikriyadvik, 108 Prakruti's can be considered to arise, but in general, 107 Prakruti's are considered eligible to arise.  From the aforementioned 107 Prakruti's, by reducing the Samyak and Mitra Mohaniya, 105 Prakruti's arise in the Mithyatva Gunasthan.  Except for the following five Prakruti's: Saksham, Apariyapt, Sadharan, Atapnam, and Mithyatvamohani, 100 Prakruti's are eligible to arise in the Sasvadan Gunasthan.  From these, the Anantanuvandhi Chatushka,

In the Marganas, the arising of the Udhay-Udhoran Sasa-Swamitva, the immovable name, the Ekandyaadi Jaatichatuk and the Tirthabanupurvi ten natures, when reduced, and the Mithmohaniya is added, there are 61 natures in the Mith Gunasthan. Of these, when the Mithmohaniya is reduced and the Samyaksyamohaniya and the Tithanchanupurvi - these two natures are combined, there are 62 natures in the Avirat Gunasthan. Except for the Apratyaachyanavaran Chatushk, Durbhaga, Anadeya, Apash and Niyamanupurvi, these eight natures, there are 84 natures in the Denavirat Gunasthan.

Here, the Nerva Nandin Pratyay Vaikriya Sharira is not intended, therefore, the Naikriya Sharira, Vaikriya Angopang, these two natures are to be considered the same everywhere.

In the Manushya Gati, there are fourteen Gunasthanas. The Devtrik, Naraknika, Vaikriyaadhik Balibatashk, Tiryaachtrik, Ujhot, Sthavar, Mukshma, Sadharan and Atap, these 20 natures do not arise in humans, therefore, when they are reduced, there are 102 natures in the Sadhay. But, in comparison to the Madhinimisak Vaikriya Sharira, when the Usarvaikriya Sharira is made, the Vaikriyaatik and the Jat name arise, so these three natures, along with 15 natures, can also arise. But, they are not expected here. Here, of the 102 natures that arise, in the Mithyatva Gunasthan, the Aharakadvak, Jimnam, Samman and Mithmohaniya, these five natures do not arise, so when they are reduced, there are 2 natures in the Udan. Except for the Aparyaptanam and the Miyamohaniya, there are 95 natures in the Sasvadan Gunasthan. When the Anantaambandhi Chatushk and the Manushyanupurni, these five natures are reduced, and the Mishra Mohaniya is added, there are 61 natures in the Mith Gunasthan. And, of these, when the Mithramohaniya is reduced and the Samyaktyamohaniya and the Manushyanupursho are combined, there are 92 natures in the Avirat Samyashti Gunasthan. Except for the Apratyaakhyanavaran Kashay Chatushk, Manushyanupurvi, Dumang, Anadesh, Ayahkoti and Nidhgotr, these 8 natures, there are 13...

The 23 Prakruti are capable of arising. Out of these 23 Prakruti, the Pratyakhyanaavaranapatuk arises and ceases in the 5th Gunasthan, leaving 76 Prakruti capable of arising in the 6th Pramabirat Gunasthan. However, the Aahaarakadwik arises in the 6th Gunasthan, so combining these two Prakruti, the total number of Prakruti arising is 61.

Apart from the Ruvanchittarik and Aahaarakadwik, there are 76 Prakruti in the 6th Gunasthan. Reducing the Samyaktvamohaniya and the last three Sanhanan from these Prakruti, there are 72 Prakruti arising in the Apoovarakaran.

Except for the Haasyadishtak, there are 66 Prakruti arising in the Anishripti Gunasthan. Excluding the Vedamik and Sanjwalan Trik, there are 60 Prakruti arising in the Sukshmasampraay Gunasthan.

Without the Sanjwalan Lok, there are 56 Prakruti in the Upshantamaah Gunasthan. Excluding the Rishabhanaraach and Naaraan, there are 57 Prakruti in the Ksheenamoha Gunasthan during the two extreme times. And excluding Nidra and Prachasa, there are 55 Prakruti in the Ksheenamoha Gunasthan during the final time.

The Gyaanaavaran (5), Darshanavaran (4), and Antaram (5) ... these 14 Prakruti arise and the Tirthankar Naamakarma becomes capable of arising, resulting in 42 Prakruti in the Sayogikevali Gunasthan.

Oudaarifatrik, Bihaayogasiddhik, Asthir, Ashubh, Pratyek, Sthir, Shubh, Manthanashtak, Agurulanalashk, Varnachanumk, Nirman Jas, Kaarman, Van, Bhanarasatra Sanhanan, Duhswar, Suruvar, Saataavedaniya, and Asaataavedaniya - excluding any one of these 31 Prakruti, there are 12 Prakruti arising in the Ayogikevali Gunasthan.

Subhag, Aadesh, Yash-koti, Saata or Asaata Vedaniya (any one), Pras, Baadar, Paryapt, Panchendriya Jaati, Manushatik, Jinnaam, and Ucch Gotr - these 12 Prakruti cease to arise at the end of the Ayogikevali Gunasthan.

**Gheshgati:** This path has four Gunasthan. Naraknik, Tiryanchchatik, Manushatik, Jaatichatushk, Oudaarikadwik, Aahaarakadwik, Sanhanan Shadhak, Yagrodhaparimandalaadi (five Santhan), Ashubh Vihaamogati, Bhaatya, ...

In the Marganas, the establishment of the arising and awakening is as follows:

1. 1. 1. Except for the four stationary things of the Jina name, the harsh voice, the neuter Veda, the low lineage, and the 42 natures of the terrafafter, the 80 natures of the gods arise from the Osha. Here, it is possible for the arising of the research karma called Shodha of the gods to be done by the Upkeya Parisha. But, there is no fault in the arising of the Udyot, which is the cause of the body of the Bhava Pratyay, being desired. Due to the Anushaya of the mixed and the Samyaktava Mohaniya in the Mithyatva Gunasthan, 78 natures are eligible for Udyoga. Due to the absence of the free, 77 natures are in the Sasvadan, and the four Ananta Anubandha and the Devana Purvi - by reducing these five natures and adding the mixed Mohaniya, there are 73 natures in the mixed Gunasthan. By reducing the mixed Mohaniya and adding the Samyaktava Mohaniya and the Devana Purvi natures to these, there are 74 natures eligible for Udyoga in the Avirast Sampandashti Gunasthan.

The Ekaindriya jati - in the Ekaindriya Margana, there are two Gunasthanas in the beginning: Vaishtaka, the five institutions of the human-higher lineage, the female Veda, the male Veda, the four Dwiiindriya jati, the Aharakashika, the Audarika, the Angopaanga, etc., the six Sanhanan, the harsh voice, the pleasant voice, the Samyaktava Mohaniya, the mixed Mohaniya, the Shubhagana Adeyatama - without these 42 natures, there are generally 80 natures in the Mithyatva Gunasthan, and the Kriya Sharira

The arising of the name occurs in the Ekaindriya Margana in 1 nature. Except for the eight natures of the Sukshmatrika aayanama, the Udyotama, the Mithyatva Mohaniya, the Ghadhatanama, and the Shwaso Chwasanama, 72 natures arise in the Sasvadan Gunasthan. Because the Sasvadan Gunasthan occurs in the Ekaindriya Prithvi, A, and Vanaspati in the insufficient state before becoming heavy-sufficient-complete, and the Atapanama, the Udyotanama, the Paravatanam, and the Ucchwasanama are not

**Appendix to the Third Karma Granth:**

**Body-Perfection and its Completion:**

After the body-perfection is complete, the subtle one-sensed being who is inclined towards right-conduct (Samyaktvam) does not arise in the insufficient and ordinary plant realm. Therefore, the subtle trika (threefold) does not arise there.

**One-Sensed:**

Just like the one-sensed, the two-sensed also has two Gunasthanas (states of being). The eight Vikriya (modifications), the three Manushya (human), the high-lineage, the female-knowledge, the male-knowledge, the four-fold one-sensed without the two-sensed, the two-fold food-taker, etc., these five Samhananas (aggregations), five Sansthanas (abodes), auspicious Viha-yoga-gati (path of liberation), Jina-name, stationary, subtle, ordinary, heat, auspicious, receivable, right-conduct-delusive, mixed-delusive, these forty Prakritis (principles) are not eligible for arising. Therefore, generally, in the Mithyatva (false-belief) Gunasthana, 82 Prakritis are eligible for arising. Out of these, without the eight Prakritis of insufficient name, Udyot (radiance), Mithyatva (false-belief), Paradhvas (destruction), inauspicious Viha-yoga-gati, Ucchvas (exhalation), Susvara (good voice), Dusbara (difficult), there are 34 Prakritis that arise in the Sasvadana (taste) Gunasthana. This is because the Mithyatva-mohaniya (delusion of false-belief) does not arise there, and except for that, the rest of the Prakritis arise only after the body-perfection is complete, and Sasvadana occurs before the body-perfection is complete.

**Three-Sensed and Four-Sensed:**

In both the three-sensed and four-sensed Jati-dana (birth-giving), the Gunasthanas are similar to the two-sensed, and the Udavasvamitva (ownership of the body) should also be understood similarly, but instead of the two-sensed, understand the three-sensed and four-sensed.

**Five-Sensed:**

In the five-sensed Jati, there are these Gunasthanas. Without the eight Prakritis of four-fold Jati, stationary, subtle, ordinary, and heat, there are 114 Prakritis that arise in the second Gunasthana, before the general one, in the general one.

**Footnotes:**

1. In the Go-Karma-Kanda, it is stated that in the second Gunasthana, before the general one, there are 66 Prakritis (excluding the Sthavara) that arise.
- Go-Karma-Kanda 306-308

2. In the Go-Karma-Kanda, it is stated that in the second Gunasthana, before the general one, there are 51 Prakritis that arise, and in the second one, there are 71 Prakritis that arise in the Vikalendriya (one-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed).

In the Marganas, the Jay-Javiran Sasa ownership of the Prakruti is present. Among them, Aharakavik, Jinnam, Samyaktva, and Mishmatyamohmi - these five Prakruti are reduced, then 106 Prakruti arise in the Miya Gunasthan. And Mithyatvamohniya, Apariapt, and Narakanupurvi... except these three Prakruti, 106 Prakruti arise in the Sasvadan Gunasthan. 

Bagumdhachaturshka and Anupurvitrik, these seven Prakruti, are absent, and by adding Mitra Modniya, 103 Prakruti arise in the Mi Gunasthan. By reducing Mitra Mohniya and combining Bhar Anupurvo and Samyaktvamohniya, 104 Prakruti arise in the Aviratsamyagdristi Gunasthan. 

Apratyaakhyanavaran Chaturshka, Vaikriyashtka, Manushyanupurvi, Tithanchanupurchi, Durbhaga, Anaav, and Ayashkiti, these 17 Prakruti, are absent, then 15 Prakruti arise in the Deshavirapt Gunasthan. And from the sixth Gunasthan to the Dhaurava Gunasthan, one should understand the Udavsvaamitva of 81, 76, 72, 66, 60, 56, 57, 42, and 12 Prakruti, respectively, similar to the Manushya Gati.

Prithvikaaya... in this Margana, one should understand two Gunasthan like Aikandiya. In the Aikandiya Margana, 42 Prakruti mentioned, and except Sadharpanam, the general Prakruti, and 6 Prakruti arise in the Mithyantranapasthan. 

Sukshma, Labdhi-Apariapt, Matar, Uchaut, Mithyashya, Paradhat, Masochchhyas, these seven Prakruti, are absent, then 72 Prakruti arise in the Sasvadan Gunasthan. In the Sasvadan Gunasthan, Karan-Apariapt is present for Prithvikaayadi, but Samidh-Apariapt is not present.

Similar to Apaya-Prithvikaaya, here also two Gunasthan are present. In the Prithvikaaya Margana, 43 Prakruti mentioned, and except Aatapanam, the general Prakruti, and Prakruti arise in the Mithyast Gunasthan. 

Here, Sukshma, Apariapt, Uyoth, Mithyatva, Paradhat, and Ucchhvas, these six Prakruti, are absent, then 72 Prakruti arise in the Sasvadan Gunasthan. Because in Bhoomi, Aikandir, and Labdhi-Apariapt, no being is born who can perform the Udavman of Samyaktva. Therefore, in the Sasvadan Gunasthan, Sukshma and Apariyas are present.

## Third Karma Text: Appendix

It does not happen. After the completion of Pariirapati, the Udyot name and Paradhat Maam arise. After the completion of Shwaso-chchwas-paryaapti, Shwaso-m-chchwas occurs, and Mithyatva-moha does not arise here.

In Hejas-kay and Kasu-kay, the first Gunasthan occurs. In Tejas-kay, except for the 44 Ap-kay, Agros, and Yash-Kiti, 76 Prakruti arise, and in Vayu-kaam, along with Rip-sharira, 77 Prakruti arise.

In Vanaspati-kay... there are two Gunasthan in this Maangana. In Ekaindriya Maangana, except for the 42 Prakruti and Atap-naam, 76 Prakruti arise in the Mithyatva Gunasthan, and 72 Prakruti arise in the Sasvadan Gunasthan.

In Sa-kay, there are fourteen Gunasthan. In it, except for the five Prakruti of Stavar, Sukshma, Sadharan, Aasap, and Ekaindriya jati, 117 Prakruti arise from the general, and 112 Prakruti arise in the Mithyatva Gunasthan, excluding the five Prakruti of Aharak-vik, Jin-naam, Samyak-tva-mohaniya, and Mith-mohaniya. Out of these, by reducing the three Prakruti of Mithyal, Apariapt, and Narak-anupurvi, 109 Prakruti arise in the Sasvadan Gunasthan. Out of these, the ten Prakruti of Ananta-anubandhi-chatursh, Vikal-endriya-nik, and Anupurvi-chik, undergo Uday-vikchhed, and by adding Mishr-mohaniya, 100 Prakruti arise in the Mishr Gunasthan. By adding the five Prakruti of Anupurvi-chatursh and Samyak-tva-mohaniya, and reducing Mishr-mohaniya, 104 Prakruti arise in the Avirat Samyag-drishti Gunasthan. In the Gunasthan of Desh-virat, etc., the 87, 81, 76, 72, 66, 60, 56, 57, 42, and 12 Prakruti mentioned in the general Uday-adhik-ar should be understood as Prama.

In Pramomog, there are thirteen Gunasthan. Except for the thirteen Prakruti of Stavar-chatursh, Jati-chatursh, Bhatap, and Anupurvi-chatursh..., 106 Prakruti arise from the general. In the Mithyatva Gunasthan, 124 Prakruti arise, excluding the five Prakruti of Aharak-tik, Jin-gaam, Samyak-tva, and Min...

In the Sasvadan devoid of Mithyatva, 103. By reducing the Anantaanusree Chatushk and merging the mind, in the Misra Gunasthan, 100, and by reducing the Misra Mod and abandoning the Samyaktva Moheeya, in the Aviratamyashta Gunasthan, 100, apart from the Apratyaasthanavaran Chatushk, Vedic Devagati Devayu, Narakati Narakayu Dur Bhag, Anadeya and Avash - these thirteen Prakritis, in the Deshavirasa Gunasthan, 57 Prakritis arise. In the remaining Gunasthanas, one should understand the Udaya to be similar to the Manushya Gati Margana.
·
Vachanayoga - Here there are thirteen Gunasthanas. Apart from the Stavar Chatushk, Ekendriya Jati, Atap and Anupurvik - these ten Prakritis, from the Samanya, 112. Aharakavik, Jinnaam, Samyavattva and Misra - these five Prakritis, in the Mithyatva Gunasthan, 107, apart from the Mithyatva Moheeya and Vikalendriya Trik, these four Prakritis, in the Sasvadan Gunasthan, 103 Prakritis arise. Although Vikalendriya is Vachanayoga, it happens only after the Bhasha Paryapti is complete, and before the Marira Paryapti from Sasvadan. Therefore, in the ten Margana, in the Sasvadan Gunasthan, Vachanayoga does not happen. Therefore, Vikalendriya Trik has been removed. By reducing the Anantaanusree Chatushk and merging the Misra Moheeya, in the Misra Gunasthan, 100 Prakritis arise. From Avirat Samyashti onwards, in the subsequent Gunasthanas, one should understand it to be similar to the Manoyoga Margana.
Kayayoga - In this Margana, there are thirteen Gunasthanas. In this, from the Samanya, 122. In the Mithyatva Gunasthan, 117, in the Sasvadan, 111, etc., one should understand the Udaya of the Prakritis mentioned in the Maamanya Udayadhikari.
Purushabeb - In this, there are nine Gunasthanas. Apart from Narakavik, Jati Chatushk, Stavar, Sukshma, Sadharan, Atap, Aparyapt Jinnaam, Streeved and Napunsak, these fifteen Prakritis, from the Samanya, 107 Prakritis arise. Apart from Baharakavik, Samyaktva and Misra, these four Prakritis, in the Mithyatva Gunasthan, 103 Prakritis, in the Sasvadan without the Mithyatva Prakriti, 102 Prakritis, from them, Anantaanubandh Chatushk and Janupurthi

##  Sutiya Kapanya: Parishit Rif

In the **Mithyatva Gunasthan**, by reducing the seven **Prakritis** and adding **Mishra Mohaniya**, there are 66 **Prakritis**, and by removing **Mishra Mohaniya** from them and adding **Samyaktv** and **Anupurvitrik** - these four **Prakritis**, there are no **Nihinas** in **Abhirati Shay Gunaru G**.

Further, in the **Denavirata Gunasthan**, without these 14 **Prakritis**: **Atyakhyanavaran Chaturuk**, **Devagati**, **Devayu**, **Naitriya Dwik**, **Durbhag**, **Anadeya**, and **Ayashch**, there are 85 **Prakritis**.

By reducing these five **Prakritis**: **Pratyashyanavaran Chaturuk**, **Niyanchagati**, **Tithanchayu**, **Udyot**, and **Nichagotra**, and adding **Aharak Dwik**, there are 76 **Prakritis** in the **Pramattasanyata Gunasthan**.

In the **Aparamatta Gunasthan**, excluding these five **Prakritis**: **Styanaddhitrik** and **Aharak Dwik**, there are 74 **Prakritis**. In the **Apuvrakaran Gunasthan**, without these four **Prakritis**: **Samyaktvamohaniya** and the last three **Sanhanan**, there are 72 **Prakritis**. And in the **Anivriti Gunasthan**, without these **Prakritis**: **Hasyaadi**, there are 64 **Prakritis**.

In the **Striveda**, there are also nine **Gunasthanas**, similar to the **Purushaveda**. Here, one should understand the emergence of the remaining **Prakritis** from the general and in the **Pramatta Gunasthan**, excluding **Aharak Dwik**, and in the fourth **Gunasthan**, excluding **Anupurvitrik**. Because, generally, during the **Parabhava** of the **Striveda**, the fourth **Gunasthan** does not occur. Therefore, **Anupurvitrik** does not emerge, and the **Stri** is not a **Chaturdasha Purvadhara**. Similarly, **Aharak Dwik** does not occur for her. Therefore, one should understand the emergence from the general and in the nine **Gunasthanas** sequentially as 105, 103, 102, 66, 65, 74, 70, and 64.

In the **Napunsakaved**, there are also nine **Gunasthanas**. In this, excluding these eight **Prakritis**: **Devtrik**, **Jinnam**, **Striveda**, **Purushaveda**, and **Aharak Dwik**, there are 114 **Prakritis** from the general. In the **Mithyatva Gunasthan**, excluding these two **Prakritis**: **Samyaktvamohaniya** and **Mishra Mohaniya**, there are 112 **Prakritis** in emergence. By reducing these six **Prakritis**: **Sukshmaruk**, **Asap**, **Mithyatva**, **Narakanupu**, there are 106 **Prakritis** in the **Sasvadan Gunasthan**.

**UruaruwelkewiswavidyaiikiVM100000000mikankviovbecणदेशालारसपाराश**

In the **UruaruwelkewiswavidyaiikiVM100000000mikankviovbecणदेशालारसपाराश** (a specific Jain text or concept), the **Upay-Udoraksha-Sasa-Swamitva** (means of protection, defense, and ownership) are discussed.

**Margnaon mein upay-udoraksha-sasa-swamitva**

In the **Margnaon** (paths or stages of spiritual progress), the **Upay-Udoraksha-Sasa-Swamitva** are important.

**Mishramohaniya ko pilane par mishra sthān mein 6 prakruttiyon aur mitr. Mohaniya ke kshay v samyakasv v marakānupūrvi ke udaugyogya hone se vist sambharashti gunasthan mein 67 prakrutti ma udauy mein hoti hain.**

When the **Mishramohaniya** (mixed karmic influences) are consumed, in the **Mishra Sthan** (mixed state), 6 **Prakruti** (categories of karma) and **Mitr. Mohaniya** (friendly karmic influences) are destroyed. This leads to the **Samyakasv** (right faith) and **Marakānupūrvi** (right conduct) becoming suitable for development. As a result, 67 **Prakruti** arise in the **Vist Sambharashti Gunasthan** (the state of extensive accumulation of karmic matter).

**Unmein se atyarupānābaranchatuṣk, narakadhi, vaikriyādik, dubhang. Anāye aur ay - in bārāh prakruttiyon ke bina deṇavirat gunasthām mein 85 prakruttiyāṁ hotī hain.**

**Sirvachagati, siyantrāmu, nīmagotr, udyot aur pratyāsamatāvaranchatugak - in ā3 prakruttiyon ko kam karne se 75 prakruttiyāṁ pramatt gunasthan mein hotī hain.**

By reducing the **Sirvachagati** (karma related to fast movement), **Siyantrāmu** (karma related to control), **Nīmagotr** (karma related to low birth), **Udyot** (karma related to radiance), and **Pratyāsamatāvaranchatugak** (four types of covering karma related to rebirth), there are 75 **Prakruti** in the **Pramatt Gunasthan** (the state of distracted mind).

**Ssyānaskhitrik... in tīn prakruttiyon ke sivāy apratmatt gunasthan mein 74 prakruttiyāṁ, samyaktvamohaniya aur antim tān sanhanan - in sār prakruttiyon ke bina apūrvakaraṇ śuṇasthan mein 70 prakruttiyon aur hāsyāviṣad ke ke bina aniti gunasthan mein 64 prakruttiyāṁ udauy mein hotī hain.**

Without the **Hāsyāviṣad** (karma related to laughter and sorrow), there are 64 **Prakruti** in the **Anīti Gunasthan** (the state of non-righteousness).

**Krodh-..yahān nau gunasthan hote hain. Mān-..-4, māyā.4, lobha-... aur jinānām - is terah prakruttiyon ke vimā sāmanya se 106, sāmyavask, mith aur āhārakādvīk-.-in 4 prakruttiyon ke bina mithyātv gamasthan mein 105, rāmvīk, ātap, mithyātv aur narakānupū:  in chhah prakruttiyon ke bina sāsvādan mein 1 prakruttiyāṁ udauy mein hotī hai.**

There are nine **Gunasthan** (states of being) in total. Without the **Krodh** (anger), **Mān** (pride), **Māyā** (delusion), **Lobha** (greed), and **Jinānām** (knowledge of the Jinas), there are 106 **Prakruti** in the **Sāmanya** (ordinary) state. Without the **Sāmyavask** (karma related to equality), **Mith** (karma related to falsehood), and **Āhārakādvīk** (karma related to food), there are 105 **Prakruti** in the **Mithyātv Gamasthan** (the state of false belief). Without the **Rāmvīk** (karma related to attachment), **Ātap** (karma related to heat), **Mithyātv** (karma related to falsehood), and **Narakānupū** (karma related to hellish rebirth), there are 1 **Prakruti** in the **Sāsvādan** (state of enjoyment).

**Anantānubandhī shodh, sthākar, ātiśchak aur ānapūrvīvīk - in mo prakruttiyon ko kam karne**

By reducing the **Anantānubandhī Shodh** (karma related to endless searching), **Sthākar** (karma related to stability), **Ātiśchak** (karma related to excessive activity), and **Ānapūrvīvīk** (karma related to previous actions),

And by combining the **Mishramohaniya** (mixed karmic influences), there are 61 **Prakruti** in the **Min Gunasthan** (the state of minimal karmic matter). By reducing the **Mishramohaniya** and combining the **Samdhyasya Mohaniya** (karma related to harmony) and **Ānapūrvīyatutak** (karma related to previous actions), there are 15 **Prakruti** in the **Avirat Gunāasthan** (the state of non-stop progress).

## Third Karma-Praya: Appendix

Here, the ownership of the arising of **mana**, **maya** and **lobha** should be understood as before. However, in the **mana** karma, there are nine **gana-sthana**. Similarly, the twelve natures of the other three karmas, excluding **mana**, should also be reduced. For example, in the **mana** karma, there are twelve divisions, including **an-an-san-ubandhi**, etc., of the other three karmas, and **jin-nama**. Apart from these thirteen natures, there are 109 natures that arise in general. Similarly, it should be understood for other karmas. In the **lobha** karma, there are 60 natures that arise when the three **veva** are reduced in this **guna-sthana**.

**Mati**, **bhut** and **avadhi** karma: Here, the fourth to twelfth **guna-sthana** are present. In general, 106 **pravritti** are eligible to arise. Except for **a-har-kanik**, in the **a-virat** **guna-sthana**, there are 104, and in the **desa-virat**, etc., **guna-sthana**, there are 87, 81, 76, 72, 66, 60, 56 and 57 natures, respectively, according to the general right to arise.

**Manah-parya-yajama** karma: In this karma, there are seven **guna-sthana** from the **pramat** **guna-sthana** to the twelfth **guna-sthana**. Therefore, there are 51 natures in general, and in the **pramat**, etc., **guna-sthana**, there are 76, 72, 66, 65, 56 natures that arise, respectively.

**Kevala-mana** karma: In this karma, there are two **guna-sthana**, the thirteenth and the **bhavan**. In them, there are 42 and 12 natures, respectively, in general.

**Mali-ajnan** and **at-ajama** karma: Here, there are three **guna-sthana** from the beginning. Except for **a-har-kanik**, **jin-nama** and **samyak-tv-mohaniya**, there are 118 natures in the **mithyatva** **guna-sthana**, 111 in the **sasvadan** **guna-sthana**, and 100 in the **misra** **guna-sthana** in general.

**Vimang-jan** karma: Here too, there are three **guna-sthana** as mentioned before. Except for **a-har-kanik**, **jin-nama**, **samyak-tv**, **sthavar-chaturshka**, **jati-chaturshka**, **at-ap**, **manushya-an-upurvi** and **tiyan-cha-an-upurvi**, there are 105 natures that are eligible to arise in general. In **manushya** and **tirth-cha**, **vi-graha-gati** does not arise with **vi-bhang-shama**, but arises with **rij-u-gati**. Therefore, **manushya-an-upurvi** and **tiyan-cha-an-upurvi** are prohibited here. In the **mithyatva** **guna-sthana**, there are 106 natures except for **misra-mohaniya**.

## Rasas

**mmmmarwarermveveo0000000TTERVISHAwereorompOTO**

In the Marganas, in the state of **Uvirama-Satta-Swamitva**, 104 **Prakritis** arise in the **Min Gunasthan** due to the combination of **Mithyatva** and **Narakanupurvi** in **Prakritis**, **Sastayan**, and the reduction of **Anantanuvandhibhaska** and **Deshanupurvi**, and the merging of **Mishra Mohaniya**.

**Samaathik** and **Chhedopasthapaniya** **Samyama** - these two **Dharimas** have four **Gunasthanas** from **Pramat** to **Neka**. In them, one should understand the **Upayaswamitva** of 81.76, 72, and 66 **Prakritis**, respectively.

**Pariharavishuddhi** - here, the sixth and seventh **Gunasthanas** exist. In them, there are 73 **Prakritis** from **Samanya** to **Pramat**, excluding eight **Prakritis** from the aforementioned 81 **Prakritis**: **Aharakatik**, **Strived**, **Pratham Sanhanan**, and the remaining **Paudha Sanhanan**.  **Pariharavishuddhi** **Charitra** does not exist for the fourteenth **Purvagara**, and **Stri** does not pass **Pariharavishuddhi**. Only those with **Vajrishabhanaracha Sanhanan** have **Pariharavishuddhi Charitra**. Therefore, the arising of the aforementioned eight **Prakritis** is prohibited here. **Sthanaachatri** is present in the **Aapramad Gunasthan** in **Prakriti**.

**Sukshmasampraaya** - here, the tenth **Gunasthan** is **Sukshmasampraaya**! Generally, the arising of 60 **Prakritis** should be understood here.

**Yathasabat** - here, the last four **Gunasthanas** are the eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth. In them, there is the arising of 56 **Prakritis** in **Upshant Moh**, 57 **Prakritis** in **Seen Goh** during **Vicharam Samaya** excluding **Rishabhanarav** and **Magach** **Sanhanan**, 55 **Prakritis** in the final **Samaya** excluding **Nidraadi**, 42 **Prakritis** in the **Mabogikowali Gunasthan**, and 12 **Prakritis** in the **Ayoginiti Gunasthan**.

**Deshavirat** - here, there is one **Gunasthan** and the arising of **Prakritis** from **Samanya** should be understood in it.

**Avirat** - in this **Margana**, the first four **Gunasthanas** exist. In it, there are 116 **Prakritis** from **Samanya**, excluding **Jinnam** and **Aharamaabik**.

**Digambaraacharyas** have considered 77 **Prakritis** as **Udayayogya** and have stated the arising of 77 and 74 **Prakritis** in the seventh and eighth **Gunasthanas**, respectively.

Out of these, without the A-pratyākhyāna-āvaraṇa-caturṣka, Ānūpūrvi-trika, Devagati, Devāyu, Vaikriya-ādika, Dubhang, Anādeya and Ayas - these fourteen Prakṛtis, there are 7 Prakṛtis in the Deśaviraṭa Guṇasthāna, 81 in the Pramasa and 76 in the Anmata.

Without the āhāra-katika, samyak-sva, mith and jina-nāma - these five Prakṛtis, there are 105 Prakṛtis in the Mithyātva. Without the miśra-rasa, there are 104 Prakṛtis in the Sāsvādana. By reducing the Ananṣānubandhi-caturṣka and Ānūpūrvi-vika from these and combining the Mitra-mohaniya, there are 68 Prakṛtis in the Mitra Guṇasthāna, 101 in the Aviraṭa Guṇasthāna and 87 in the Deśaviraṭi.

Third Karma Granth: Appendix

**Saints:** There are fourteen Gunasthans in this. In relation to Yama, only the Kevalishani is considered a Sanshi, therefore there are fourteen Gunasthans here. But if we consider the Sanshi in relation to the destruction and pacification of Matibhanaavaran, which is the state of mind that arises from contemplation and absorption, then there are twelve Gunasthans in this Margna. In this, there are 114 pratiyas in the state of Udya, excluding the four pratiyas of Sthavar, Sukshma, Sadharan, Aata, and Jaati. If we consider the Sanshi in relation to Bhaavaman, then there are 113 pratiyas in this Margna, as there is no rise of Vilaan in the state of Udya. Excluding the four pratiyas of Prahaar Kshatik, Samyaktva, and Mishra, there are 176 pratiyas in the state of Mishab. Excluding the three pratiyas of Apariapt Naam, Mithyatva, and Narakasupurvi, there are 136 pratiyas in the state of Saasvadan. Excluding the seven pratiyas of Anantaanubandhi Chatushk and Aapatrik, and including Mishra Mohniya, there are 10 pratiyas in the state of Mishra Gunasthan. And in the Gunasthans of Nirata and onwards, one should understand the general state of Udya Swamitva.

**Non-Saints:** There are two Gunasthans in this. Excluding the sixteen pratiyas of Vaikriya Ashtak, Jinnaam, Shrahaar Kshatik, Sabhyapatya, Mishra Mohniya, Uchch Gotra, Stri Ned, and Purush Ved, there are 106 pratiyas in the state of Udya. Excluding the fifteen pratiyas of Bhukhsmatrik, Aata, Udyot, Manushya Vik, Mithyaasva, Garadhat, Janaam, Susvar, Dusvar, Shubh Vihaamogati, and Ashubh Vihaayogati, there are 11 pratiyas in the state of Saasvadan. In the state of Udya, the Asantri has been given six Mahanan and six Grah Sansthans. Therefore, he also has those six Mahanan and six Sansthans, as well as Shubh, Aadesh, and Shubh Vihaayogati.

**Ahaarash:** There are 118 Gunasthans in this. Excluding the four pratiyas of Anupurvi Chatushk, there are 118 pratiyas in the state of Udya. Excluding the five pratiyas of Maharakaadik, Jinnaam, Samyaktva Mohniya, and Min Mohniya, there are 113 pratiyas in the state of Mishab. Excluding the five pratiyas of Sukshma Vik, Aata, and Minyaay, there are 158 pratiyas in the state of Saasvadan. Excluding the nine pratiyas of Anantaanubandhi Chatushk, Sthavar Naam, and Jaati Chatushk, and including Mishra Mohniya, there are...

In the coming Gunasthanas, one should understand the general Upayaswamitwa.
Anaharak - in this Margana, 1, 2, 4, 13 and 14 - these are the five Gunasthanas. Audarikdwik, Vaikriyatik, Aharakdrik, Sanhanan Shadak, Sansthan Shadak, Vihayo Gatidwik, Upadhas, Paraghāt, Umdyas, Pasap, Udhot, Pratyek, Sadharan, Muswar, Duhswar, Misra Mohaniya and Nidra Panchak - without these 35 natures, there are 8 in the general Khe. Jinnam and Samyaktva Mohaniya - without these two natures, there are 25 in Mithyatva. Sukshma, Apariyapt, Mithyatva and Naraktrik - without these six natures, there are 76 natures in Saswadan. There is no Anaharak in the Misra Gunasthan. Anantanubandho Chatushk, Sthavar and Jatipat Shadak - without these nine natures, and by adding Samyaktva Mohaniya and Naraktrik - these four natures, there are 74 natures in the Aviras Gunasthan. Varnavatarak, M. Karman, Amukal, Nirman, Sthir, Asthir, Bh. Abh, Manushayagati, Panchendriya Jati, Jinnam, Prasadik Mumbhag, Aadey, Yash, Manushayay, Vedaniyanik and Uchchgotra - these twenty-five natures arise in the Madhyagini Gunasthan only upon the occurrence of Mamushwas in the third, fourth and fifth time. Vastrika, Mamukhyagati, Manushayayu, Uchchgotra, Jinnam, Sata or Asata - one of these, Vedaniya, Subhag, Aadey, Yash and Panchendriya Jati - these twelve natures arise in the fourteenth Bhubhasman. Here, the intention of Usarvaikriya is not expressed in the Uday. In the Siddhant, Prithvi, Ap and Vanaspati are not considered as Saswadan Gunasthan, the one who has Saswadan Gunasthan is called Matishrutshani. Vibhangavani is called Avhidarshan and Kriyamitra and Paharakami are called Audarikami, but this is not expressed in the Karmagranth.

**Third Karma Granth: Appendix**

The period from the time of the arising of the Udharana-Swamitva (ownership of the Udharana) until one Avali (a unit of time) is called Udhaya-Avali. No Karmapudgal (karma particle) that enters the Udhaya-Avali is subject to any Karan (cause). The Udharana is the experience of the Karmapudgal that remains outside the Udhaya-Avali, combined with the Karmapudgal of the Udhaya-Avali. The Udharana of the Karmas of the same type occurs as the arising of the Karmas of that type. Therefore, generally, in the same Mangana (stage of existence) and in the same Gunasthan (stage of spiritual development), the number of Udharanas of the Karmaprakritis (types of karma) is equal to the number of Karmaprakritis that arise. However, there are exceptions:

* If, while experiencing a particular Prakriti (type of karma), there are Karmapudgal remaining in its Mala (chain) that are eligible for experience within the Avali period, then its Udharana does not occur.
* Karmas that enter the Udhaya-Avali before the completion of the Sharira-Parapti (perfection of the physical body) are not eligible for Udharana.
* After the completion of the Sharira-Parapti, if the Indriya-Parapti (perfection of the senses) is not complete, then the Udharana of the five Indriyas (senses) does not occur, only their arising.
* From the sixth Gunasthan onwards, the Udharana of the Manushya-Ayu (human lifespan), the Sata and Asata Vedaniya Karmas (karmas that produce pleasant and unpleasant experiences) does not occur due to the absence of the Yogya Adhyavasaya (suitable determination) for their removal, only their arising.
* In the fourteenth Gunasthan, due to the absence of Yoga (spiritual union), the Udharana of any Prakriti does not occur, only their arising.

**Sasvasmitva**

The Sasvasmitva (ownership of the self) discusses the existence of the Prakritis in the 62 Uttar-Manganas (higher stages of existence) after the Joodga-Jiraya-Swamin (the owner of the Joodga-Jiraya). There are 148 Prakritis mentioned in the Sasvasmitva.

**Marpati and Devagati**

In both the Marpati (hell) and Devagati (heaven) Manganas, there are 117 Prakritis that exist, except for the Devayau (heavenly lifespan) in Marpati and the Narayau (human lifespan) in Devagati. This is because the Devayau does not exist in Narakagati (hell), and the Narayau does not exist in Devagati. In the Mithyatva Gunasthan (stage of false belief), the Jitnaga (knowledge of the self) does not exist in Devagati, but it does exist in Marakagati (hell). Therefore, in Devagati, there are 146 Prakritis in the Mithyatva Gunasthan, and in Narakagati, there are 147 Prakritis. In the second and third Gunasthan, there are 146 Prakritis that exist, except for the Jinnama (knowledge of the Jina). In the Avirat Gunasthan (stage of non-stop activity), the Kshayik (destructive) ...

The Samyagdrishti of Aupamika and Kshayopaamika has the existence of 147 natures without one Ayu. Because the Devayus of the Marakas and the Narakayu of the Devas do not exist in the assembly. The Kshayika Samyagdristi also does not exist in the Sivayu.
Here in the Manushya-Gati, there is the existence of 148 species in the general and Mithyatva Gunasthan. In the second and third Gunasthan, there is the existence of 143 natures except for the Jinanam.
In the Avirat Samyagdristi Gunasthan, the Kshayika Sampadristi (Acharamshariri) has the existence of 136 natures without these nine natures: the Upashamak of Maritra-moha, Tiryanchayu, Narakayu, Anantanubandhi-chatushk and Darshanmohaniya-trika. And the Barmadhariri, the Upashamak of Charitra-moha, the Upashama-Samyagdristi, has the existence of 141 natures except for three Ayus after the disassociation of Anantanubandhi-chatushk. The Dharayopaamika Samyagdristi, the Gharamshariri, who is going to start Kshapani in the future, has the existence of 145 natures except for these three natures: Narakayu, Tiryanchayu and Devasyu. And after the destruction of these seven natures: Anantanubandhi-chatushk and Darshanmohaniya-trika, there is the existence of 138 natures. The Barashama-Samyagdristi (Charamshariri), the starter of the Upashama category in the future, has the existence of 146 natures except for Narak and Tiryancha Ayu. And after the disassociation of Anantanubandhi-chatushk, there is the existence of 142 natures.
In these three places: Deshavirat, Pramaps and Apramat, there is the existence of the fourth Gunasthan of the Upashama category and the Kshapaka category, which takes refuge in them.
In the Apoovarnakaran Gunasthan, the Upashamak of Charitra-moha, the Upashama-Samyagdristi, has the existence of 142 natures without these six natures: Anantanubandhi-chatushk, Tiryanchayu and Narakayu. The Kshayika Sampadristi, the Upashamak of Charitra-moha...

In the Magangas, the ownership of Uday, Udirana, and Satta is as follows:

**Mithyatva:** Here, from the general to the Mithyatva Gunasthan, there are 148 Prakṛtis in existence.

**Sanji:** From the first to the thirteenth Gunasthan, one should know the ownership of existence as in the human path. Here, only the Kevalajnani is called Sanji in relation to the Bravyaman. If the expectation of Bhavamana is kept, then there are twelve Gunasthanas in the Sansi Margna.

**Asanti:** Here, from the general to the Mithyatva Gunasthan, there are 147 Prakṛtis in existence except for the Jinnama, and in the Sasvadan Gunasthan, there are 146 Prakṛtis in existence except for the Narakayu. However, here in the Aparaptavāstā, it is not possible for anyone to have the Dhar of Devayu and Manushayau, therefore, there are 144 Prakṛtis in existence from that perspective.

**Aharak:** From the first to the thirteenth Gunasthan, one should know the ownership of existence as in the Manushayati Margma.

**Anaharak:** In this Margna, there are five Gunasthanas: the first, second, and fourth, and in them, one should know the ownership of existence as in the human path.

**Tryam:** Thus, the discussion of Uday, Udirana, and Satta ownership is complete. In particular, the thirteenth and fourteenth Gunasthanas are the same as the human path.

This is a description of Uday, Udirana, and Satta ownership in the Magangas, according to my best knowledge. If there are any errors or ambiguities, I humbly request the learned readers to kindly point them out so that I can rectify my understanding. I will be grateful for their cooperation and guidance.

**The meaning of Bandha, Udaya and Satta-Samitva in the Digambara Karma-Sahitya**

The third Karma-Grantha discusses the Bandha-Samitva in the Marganas based on the Gunasthanas. Similarly, this is also discussed in the Gommatasar Karma-Kanda in Gatha 105 to 121. The information necessary to understand this generally is also indicated in Gatha 64 to 104.

The discussion of Udayas in the Upastanas is not found in the ancient or the new third Karma-Grantha. It is discussed in the Mo. Karma-Kanda in Gatha 260 to 332. The necessary information for this is collected in Gatha 263 to 286. The discussion of Udiranas-Samitva is also included in this Udaya-Samitva chapter. Similarly, the discussion of Satta-Samitva in the Marganas is also found in the Go. Karma-Kanda, but not in the Karma-Grantha. This chapter is in the Go. Karma-Kanda in Gatha 346 to 356. The general information for this is in Gatha 333 to 345.

Students of Karma-Shastra should study these sections comparatively and use them from a scientific perspective. For complete details, one should refer to the above sections of the Go. Karma-Kanda.

**Bandha-Samitva**

To discuss Bandha-Samitva in the Marganas with the Gunasthanas, the number of Karma-Kriyas that are generally capable of being bound, incapable of being bound, and those that are bound and then broken, are explained in three Gathas.

**Number of Bandha Prakṛitis**

**Sattarseka Ggasyam Chausattari Samatt Tevatthi. Dhavanadu Vīs Sattarseko.** || 1*3 ||

The number of Bandha Prakṛitis in the Gunasthānas starting from Mithyādṛṣṭi are respectively 117, 101, 7475, 67, 63, 56, 58, 22, 17, 1, 1. This type of Bandha occurs until the 13th Gunasthāna. In the 14th Gunasthāna, there is no Bandha. This means that there are 120 Prakṛitis that are generally capable of Bandha. In the Mithyādṛṣṭi Gunasthāna, the Bandha of three Prakṛitis, namely Ārer and Āhārakādi, does not occur, leaving 120 - 3 = 117 Prakṛitis. Similarly, one should understand in the second and subsequent Gunasthānas that, for example, in the first Gunasthāna, there are 16 Vyuchchhinna Prakṛitis and 3 Prakṛitis are bound, so 16 + 3 = 16 Prakṛitis are bound in the second Gunasthāna, meaning that 16 Prakṛitis are not bound. Similarly, in the subsequent Gunasthānas, by subtracting the Vyuchchhinna Prakṛitis, the number of Bandha Prakṛitis for each Gunasthāna can be determined.

**Number of Avandha Prakṛitis**

**Liya Unavīs Chasiyatal Tevann Sattvannam Cha. Igidugasatti Virhiy Say Tiyadanavis Sahiy Vīs Sayam.** || 104 ||

The number of Avandha Prakṛitis in the Gunasthānas starting from Mithyādṛṣṭi are respectively 16, 46, 43, 53, 57, 61, 62, 6, 103, 116, 116, 116, and 120. This means that, according to the numbers mentioned above, the Bandha of the corresponding number of Prakṛitis does not occur in each Gunasthāna.

Third Karma Text: Appendix
In the fourteen Gunasthanas of Mithyatva, etc., there are 16, 25, 0 (zero), 1, 4, 6, 1, 36 (2+34), 5, 16, respectively.
0.01 Nature is cut off.
It is Holi.
132
The general rule of the bondage of Karma-natures in the Gunasthanas is as follows:
"Aharadugam pamadarahideesu. Missu aus ya micchaadisuu sesabandhi." ||2||
From the eighth Gunastana of Aviratamyasti, the nature of the Tirthankara is cut off. The bondage of Aharakadrik occurs in the Apramattasanyata Gunastana. In the Misra Gunastana, there is no bondage of Ayu, and the bondage of the remaining natures occurs in the Gunasthanas of Mithyadristi, etc., until their own cutting off.
Bondage, Abandha, and Bandhyuchchitti in the Marganas
Six-
In the Marganas, the bondage, Abandha, and Bandhyuchchitti of the Karma-natures should be understood as being the same as in the Gunasthanas. But the special features in them are explained in detail with respect to each Margana, such as गति (Gati), etc.
Gati Margana
"Oye va aadeshe narayamiichhi chaari vochchina.
Uvarim varas surachau suraj aharayam bandha." ||105||
In the Marganas, it should be understood as being the same as in the Gunasthanas of Yuti, etc., but in the Mithyatva Gunastana, out of the sixteen natures that are cut off, the Narakagati
*********...
1 There is no cutting off of the bondage of any nature.
F
2 Vyuchchhinna is the name for being cut off. The meaning of the number of natures that are cut off in the Gunastana where it is mentioned is that the association of that nature remains until that Gunastana, but in the subsequent Gunasthanas, its bondage, उदय (Uday), and existence do not remain.

Page #161:
---------------------------
The commentary on the Karma Sastra by Andhaadi Swami Vigambar states that there are four types of vyutpatti (origin): Mithyatva, Hud Sansthan, Napunsak Veda, and Sewart Sanhanan. In addition to these, there are sixteen other prakritis (principles): the four remaining prakritis, Devanati Devanupurvi, Vaiya Sharira Vaiya Angopang, Devayu, Aharak Sharira, and Aharak Angopang. This means that the 11 prakritis are not bound in the Mithyatva Gunasthan of the Narakpati (hell-lord). There are 101 prakritis that are capable of being bound from the general perspective.

**Verse 1106:**
In the first hell (Varma), the Tirthankara prakriti is bound in both the sufficient and insufficient states. In the second and third hells (Mansha Bhaeya), the sufficient being is bound by the Tirthankara prakriti. Up to the sixth hell (Maghavi), the Manudhyayu is bound. In the seventh hell (Heat), only the Mithyatva Gunasthan is bound.

**Verse 107:**
In the seventh hell, the Misra and Avirat Gunasthan are bound by the three prakritis: Manushya Gali, Manushyanupurvi. Beings with the Mithyatva and Samadan Gunasthan do not bind these three prakritis.

**Verse 108:**
In the Tiryag (animal) realm, the understanding is similar to the Vyuchchitti etc. Gunasthan. However, the Tirthankara Aharak Sharira and Aharak Angopang are not bound. Therefore, 117 prakritis are capable of being bound in the Tiryag realm. In the Bidhe Avirat Gunasthan, only the four prakritis of Apratyakhyanavaran, Krodha, etc. are vyuchchitti. The remaining are suitable for the Manushya Gati (human realm).

**Death Karma Question: Appendix**

The six types of **pratikrti** (nature) - **rishbhanaraach**, **samhanan**, etc. - are **vyuchikta** (separated) in the second **gunasthana** (stage of spiritual progress) of **saasvadan** (taste). This is because here, the **pratikrti** related to the **manushya** (human) path are not bound in **misyadhik** (false perception).

The above statement should be understood in the context of the **nirgach** (liberation) in the **samaan vich** (general thought) - **matron ka samay 1** (time of the matras), **panthendriya tiyanch**, **paryapt tiyanch**, **striya vich**, and **ladhyaparyapt niyanch**.  Of these five categories, the **ladhyaparyapt niyanch** should be excluded. The remaining four types of **tiryanch** (non-human beings) should be understood in comparison to the **tiryanch**.

The **tiryanch** of the **ladhyaparyapt niyanch** have **tirthar** (pilgrims) names and **aaharaka** (food-taking) bodies, **aaharaka angopaang** (food-taking limbs), and **man** (mind) **leen pratikrti** (absorbed nature). The following **pratikrti** are also not bound:

**Suraniryaou apushon kegumviyakkamvi sthii ||106||**

**Devayau**, **narakayau**, and **vaishyishtak-devagati**, **devanupurvi**, **narakagati**, **narakanupurvi**, **vaikriya parir**, **vaikriya angopaang** - these 13 **pratikrti** are also not bound.

**Tiryedha gare gavari hu tisthaaram cha asthi amev ||110||**

In the **manushya** path, **andhayumiti** (blindness) and other **tiryanch** paths should be understood similarly, but with the exception that in the **manushya** path, **tirthar** (pilgrims), **krura** (cruel), and **aaharaka** (food-taking) **aaharaka arir** (food-taking body), **aaharaka angopaang** (food-taking limbs) are also bound, making a total of 120 **pratikrti** that can be bound.

There are 14 **gunasthana** (stages of spiritual progress) in the **manushya** path, so the **bandha** (binding) and **vichched** (separation) should be understood in the same way as in the **gunasthana**.

The above **bandha** and **vichched** in the **manushya** path have been explained generally. However, the **bandha** etc. of the **ladhy-aparyapt** (limited) **manushya** should be understood similarly to the **ladhy-aparyast** (limited) **tiryanch**. In other words, the **ladhy-aparyapt** **manushya** also have 106 **pratikrti** that can be bound.

**Nirev hodi deve aisaanoti satt kaam chidi 1**
**Solas chev abandha bhavatie nasthi tisthayar ||11||**

In the **devagati** (heavenly path), the **bandha** and **vichched** of **karma** **pratikrti** (karmic nature) are similar to the **narakagati** (hellish path).

It should be understood. But there is a special feature that in the Madhyavrusti Gunasthan, from the first Gunasthan to the Ishana heaven, only the Mithyara, etc., 16 types of Prakruti are destroyed. The remaining nine, namely, Sukshma, etc., Deva-mati, Devanupurti, Vaikriya Bharira, Krim Angopang, Devayu, Maharak Sharira, Baharak Angopang - 7, are a total of 16 types of Andharupa. Therefore, there are 104 types of Bandhayoga Prakruti here. In Bhavanavaso, Syantar and Jyotishi Devi, there is no smell of Sikar Prakruti, so 1.3 types of Bandhayoga are present. Nit and Kama Margana
Punidaranga Vigivigale Tatthupyayo Hu Sasanda) Dehe. Pajatti Vi Pavati Idi Garitiriayaug Patthi. 113. In Ekendriya and Vikalayokendriya, Shrendriya and Masurindriya, there are 106 types of Bandhayoga Prakruti, like the state of Lamdhiaparyapt. Because in the state of Aparyapt, the 11 types of Prakruti, namely, Tirghar, Aharakathik, Devayu, Narakagu and Kiyapadak, do not bind. The first and second of the Ekendriya and Vikalatraya are the two Shrunasthan. In the first Gunasthan, there are 15 types of Bandhabhyuksiti. Because it is said that in the first Gunasthan, 16 types of Prakruti are destroyed, but here, Marakdrik and Garmayu are destroyed, and Manushayau and Tirya-chayu are increased. Therefore, only 15 types are destroyed. The reason for saying that Manushayau and Tirya-chayu are destroyed in the first Gunasthan is that the Jina born in Ekendriya and Vikalayokendriya cannot complete the Bharira-paryapsi in the Mrunasthan, because the time of the Sasvadan Gunasthan is short and the time of the Niyati Aparyapt state is long. Due to this, Manushayau and Tirya-chayu are not bound in the Mrunasthan, and binding and destruction occur only in the first Gunasthan.

## Chapter 136: Appendix to the Third Karma

**Understanding the Guṇasthānas of the Five-Sensed Beings**

The Guṇasthānas of the five-sensed beings, such as Vyuchitti, should be understood in the same way as the Guṇasthānas of the earth-bodied beings, etc., up to the plant-bodied beings. In Kāyamārgaṇā, the Vyuchitti, etc., should be understood as being like the one-sensed beings. The special feature is that in the Tejas-kāya and Vāyu-kāya, there is no bondage of the four natures: human motion, human-like beings, human lifespan, and higher realms. The Guṇasthāna is only a false perception (Miśyādṛṣṭi).

**Understanding the Guṇasthānas of the Śrama-kāya**

The Guṇasthānas of the Śrama-kāya should be understood in the same way as the Guṇasthānas of the blind-sighted, etc. In Yogamārgaṇā, the Manoyoga and Vachanayoga are also like Guṇasthānas. In Audārika Kāyayoga, the bondage and liberation are similar to human motion.

**Understanding the Guṇasthānas of the Audārika Kāyayoga**

In Audārika Kāyayoga, the bondage and liberation are similar to the Audārika Kāyayoga, but there is a special feature: there is no bondage of the six natures: Devay, Narakāyu, Āhārak Śarīra, Āhārak Angopānga, Narakagati, and Narakāsupūrvi. This means that there is only bondage of 114 natures. Even in these, there is no bondage of the five natures: Devacatuṣka and Tīrthaṅkara name, in the two Guṇasthānas of Mithyātva and Sāsvādana. However, there is bondage of these in the Avirad Samyagdṛṣṭi Guṇasthāna.

**Understanding the Guṇasthānas of the Audārika Miśra Kāyayoga**

In Audārika Miśra Kāyayoga, the bondage and liberation of 15 and 26 natures should be understood in the two Guṇasthānas of Miśyādṛṣṭi and Sāsvādana, respectively. In the 14th Avirad Samyagdṛṣṭi Guṇasthāna, there is bondage and liberation of 66 natures: the four mentioned above and 65 others. In the 13th Sayogikevalī Guṇasthāna, there is only Vyuchitti of one Sāsāvedaniya.

**The essence of the text is about the different types of karma and their effects on the soul's liberation in Jainism.**

**Here's a breakdown of the translation:**

* **"Andhavisvamisva vigambar karma sahitaya ka mantrabhya"** - This phrase refers to the "blind universe" (Andhavisvamisva) and the "unclothed karma" (vigambar karma) which are concepts related to the state of ignorance and the accumulation of karma. The phrase "mantrabhya" suggests a discussion about the mantras or teachings related to these concepts.

* **"Deve va ve misse paratiriyaaun gurnvahare tammisse path"** - This translates to "In the case of gods or in the case of mixed beings, the qualities of the soul are revealed." This refers to the different types of beings in the Jain cosmology and how their karmic states affect their qualities.

* **"Kayayoga mein devagata ke saman bandhavicchedh aadi samjhana chahiye"** - This means "In the context of Kayayoga (the practice of controlling the body), one should understand the liberation from karma as similar to that of the gods." This highlights the importance of Kayayoga in achieving liberation.

* **"Kriyamishra kayayoga mein saudharma aishana sambandhi apariapt devon ke saman bandhayuti hai, kintu us mishra mein mamushayau aur visanu ka bandh nahin hota hai"** - This translates to "In the mixed Kayayoga, which involves actions, there is a connection to karma similar to that of the imperfect gods of the Saudharma and Aishana realms. However, in this mixed state, there is no bondage to the lifespan of a human (mamushayau) or to the lifespan of a poisonous creature (visanu)." This explains the different types of karma and their effects on different beings.

* **"Aharak kayayoga mein chathe gunasthan jaisa bandhavicchedh aadi hota hai"** - This means "In the Kayayoga of the Aharak (those who consume food), the liberation from karma is similar to that of the sixth Gunasthan (stage of spiritual progress)." This further clarifies the different types of Kayayoga and their corresponding levels of liberation.

* **"Aharak mishrayoga mein vayu ka bandh nahin hota hai"** - This translates to "In the mixed Kayayoga of the Aharak, there is no bondage to the lifespan of a being with a wind-like body (vayu)." This emphasizes the specific karmic limitations of different types of beings.

* **"Kamme ural misse vanavadushi va hindi ayde"** - This means "In the Kayayoga of Karma (Kamme ural), the liberation from karma is similar to that of the noble ones (vanavadushi) and the non-violent ones (hindi)." This highlights the importance of ethical conduct in achieving liberation.

* **"Karman kayayoga mein bandhavicchedh aadi audarikamiv kayayoga ke sadrish hain"** - This translates to "In the Kayayoga of Karma, the liberation from karma is similar to that of the noble Kayayoga." This emphasizes the connection between ethical conduct and liberation.

* **"Lekin vimati mein aayu ka bandh nahin hone se manushayau tatha tichayau - in do ka bhi nahin hota hai aur vo gunasthan mein nau prakritiyon ki vyut hoti hai"** - This means "However, due to the absence of bondage to the lifespan (aayu) in the state of non-violence (vimati), there is no bondage to the lifespan of a human (mamushayau) or to the lifespan of a creature with a lifespan of three years (tichayau). And in that Gunasthan, there is a separation of the nine natures." This explains the specific karmic effects of non-violence and the resulting spiritual progress.

* **"Ved se aharak marganga paryant"** - This translates to "From the Vedas to the Aharak marganga (the path of those who consume food)." This refers to the different stages of spiritual progress in Jainism.

* **"Vedadahaarot ya sagunaththana mocham tu"** - This means "The Vedas teach the liberation from the Gunasthan (stages of spiritual progress)." This highlights the importance of the Vedas in understanding the path to liberation.

* **"Variya satrasammai rasurakshauuni gasthi niyamen"** - This translates to "The seven types of good conduct (satrasammai) protect the soul (rasurakshauuni) and lead to liberation (gasthi niyamen)." This emphasizes the importance of ethical conduct in achieving liberation.

* **"Sukke sadar vamatimbarasan cha va"** - This means "The white (sukka) and the black (vamatimbarasan) are both part of the path to liberation." This refers to the two types of karma, white and black, and their role in the path to liberation.

* **"Kammeva anahare bandhassanto maganto ya"** - This translates to "The karma (kammeva) that is not consumed (anahare) leads to bondage (bandhassanto) and the path to liberation (maganto ya)." This emphasizes the importance of controlling karma in order to achieve liberation.

* **"Margena mein sabhi arthath dono hi up samyakta jivon ke manushayau aur vayu ka bandh nahin hota"** - This means "On the path (margena), both types of beings who are partially enlightened (up samyakta) are free from the bondage to the lifespan of a human (mamushayau) and to the lifespan of a being with a wind-like body (vayu)." This explains the specific karmic limitations of partially enlightened beings.

* **"Heereint mein tejo leshya va ke midhyatva gunasthan ki ant ki nau tatha padam leshya vale ke miya gunaswan ki anya ki barah prakritiyon ka bandh nahin hota hai"** - This translates to "In the case of those who have the Tejo leshya (radiant aura) and those who are in the state of ignorance (midhyatva), there is no bondage to the nine natures of the last Gunasthan and to the twelve natures of the other Gunasthan of those who have the Padam leshya (footprint aura)." This explains the specific karmic limitations of different types of beings based on their aura.

* **"Shukla leshya"** - This means "White aura." This refers to the aura of those who have achieved a high level of spiritual progress.

**Overall, the text discusses the different types of karma, their effects on the soul's liberation, and the importance of ethical conduct and spiritual practice in achieving liberation.**

##  Tasiya Karmagranth: Appendix

The four Shatar Chatushkas (Tiyangat, Tirya-manupurvi, Liyandhay, Uchit) and the 12 of the Mithya-hristi Gunasthanas, totaling 16 Prakrutis, do not experience Bandha.  One should understand the Bandha-vichched (binding and release) in the Ahar-marg-na as being like the work of Anahan or the work of Yoga.

In the Uday and Udirana-svamitva Marg-nas, before stating the Uday and Udirana-svamitva, the following verses explain the general rules:

**Uday Prakrutis in Gunasthanas**

> "Sattarsep-kar-khach-du-sahi-yas-yam sagi-gisi-di du-sadari. Chavaththi sathi nav-sag-van-nas du-das-bar-udaya." (27)

In the Mithya-hristi and other 14 Gunasthanas, there are at least 117, 111, 100, 104, 87, 81, 76, 72, 66, 60, 56, 57, 42, and 12 Prakrutis that experience Uday.

**Anushaya Prakrutis**

> "Panchekk-aras-ba-vis-sattha ras-panch-tis igi-chhad-alan. Paparn chhapp bit-pan-si-iy asi-di du-gu-ya-ghan-yan-nam." (277)

In the Mithya-hristi and other Gunasthanas, there are at least 5, 11, 22, 15, 35, 41, 46, 50, 56, 62, 63, 65, 80, and 110 Prakrutis that are Anudaya (do not experience Uday).

**Up-vibhinna Prakrutis**

> "Pan nav igi sattar-san ad' panch ch chour chhak chch-ev. Igi-d-g solas tis-an baras udare a-jog-ta." (264)

In the Mithya-hristi and other 14 Gunasthanas, there are 5, 6, 1, 17, 1, 5, 4, 6, 6, 1, 2, 16, 30, and 12 Prakrutis that experience Udar-disht (manifestation).

Prakrutis that do not experience Uday are called Anushaya.

Page #167:
---------------------------
**Bandhavisvamitva Digambar Karmagrahitva ka Mantvya:**

**Translation:**

**Commentary on Bondage, Universal Lordship, Digambara, and Karma-Acceptance:**

**Verse 285:**

The rise of speed, anupurvi, and lifespan occurs in the past time itself, suitable for the intended fear. The rise of lifespan, called "aya," occurs only for the badara-sufficient living beings. The rise of lineage occurs only for humans and gods, and the rise of the three sleep states, styanaddhi, etc., occurs for humans and the three types of beings.

**Verse 286:**

The rise of the three sleep states, styanaddhi, etc., occurs for humans and the three types of beings who have a lifespan of a countable number of years and whose sensory faculties are fully developed. However, it does not occur for humans who possess the power of food and the power of macrocosm.

**Verse 287:**

In the non-harmonious guna-sthana of the nirvrittyaryataks, there is no rise of the Vedas. Similarly, except for the first hell, ratnaprabha, the other three gatis do not experience the rise of the state of being a eunuch in the fourth guna-sthana, which is the state of eternal perfection. Therefore, the non-harmonious beings who have the female Veda and the eunuch Veda do not experience the rise of the four anupurvis and the three anupurvis of the hell, which are the final anupurvis.

**Verse 288:**

The three types of beings, the eunuchs, and the humans do not experience the rise of the anupurvis. The rise of the anupurvis occurs for the other types of beings, the gods, and the devendras.

## The Third Karma Bandha: Appendix

**The three types of disabilities, namely, Afeendriya, Deendriya, and Vikal, and the four types of beings, namely, Sthavar, etc., are eligible for birth in the realm of the Ringamंच. The insufficient nature is also eligible for birth in the realms of Tiryanch and Manushya. The six types of Sanhanan, namely, Vajra, Rishabha, Nara, Ach, etc., and the pair of Audarik Parira Karma (Audarik body, Audarik limbs) are eligible for birth in the realm of Manushya. The Kriya body and the remaining limbs are eligible for birth in the realms of Dev and Narak.**

**Teutiguṇatirikhhesumjovo Bāhareṣu Puṇṇeṣu.
Māṇaṁ Payadiṇaṁ Oga vā Hodi Udao Du. ||26||**

**Except for the Tejaskaayik, Vayukaayik, and the common Vanaspatikaayik, the remaining sufficient Tiryanch beings are eligible for birth in the realm of Udyot Prakriti. The remaining eligible beings should be understood according to their Gunasthanas.**

**Thus, having understood the rules of birth for the various types of beings, we now discuss the types of beings eligible for birth in the various Marganas.**

**Gati Margana**

**Thonatithi Purisna Ghaadi Niryaauṇīchayanīyam.
Nāme Samachithaṇam Giramaṇa Nāra Sudaya. ||2||**

**Except for the five types of beings, namely, Styanadidhi, etc., the 42 types of beings belonging to the Ghati Karma, the Charakayu, the Nīcha Gotra, and the Sata Asata Vedaniya, and the 26 types of beings belonging to the Namakarma, which are eligible for birth in the realm of Bhagyapatti, and the 76 types of beings belonging to the Narakgatyānupūrvi, are eligible for birth in the realm of Bharakgati.**

**The names of the 26 types of beings are as follows:**

**Veguvvatejavirasudugu Duggadihundanimin Pandhindi.
Pirayagadi Dubbhamaagurutasavannach Ya Bachithaṇam. ||2613||**

**Kriya, Taija, Sthira, Shubha - these pairs, and the Aprast Vihayogati, Huns Sansthan, Nirman, Pankhendri, Narakgati, and the Dubhang-Agusaladhu-Bas-Varna.**

These 26 Prakṛtis, in total, arise in place of the verbal expressions of the destructive emotions.

**Miṣamantam Miṣṣam Miṣṣādītiye Kama Chidi Ayade.**
**Vidiyakasāya Dubhagaṇādejjadugāuṇirayacau 33262.**

Firstly, in the three realms of hell, the fourfold Miṣyatva, which is eternally connected, and Samyagmiṣyatva, are cut off from arising. In the fourth realm of hell, the fourfold A-pratyāropa-āvaraṇa, Durbhaga, Svar, Anādeya, Ayāna, Koti-narakāyu, Naraka-dvīka, Vaikiya-śarīra, Vaikriya-angopaṅga... these 16 Prakṛtis are cut off from arising.

From the second to the seventh hell, the arising of the first hell is considered the same, but there is this difference: in the realm of the un-controlled qualities, the arising of the hell is not sequential. Therefore, in the realm of the Miṣyatva qualities, the arising of the hell is cut off along with the Svāsana Prakṛti.

**Tirithé Odho Suraṇaraṇirayāūnaccha Mahāradurg.**
**Vegunvchakkalittham Pathi Hu Émeva Samāgnaṁ. ||264||**

In the third hell, the realm of qualities is considered to have the same arising. However, among them, Devāyu, Manuṣyāyu, Narakāyu, Ucca-gotra, Manuṣmati-nik, Āhāra-kāddhika, and Vaikriya-śarīra, along with the 6 Leśa-kara, these 15 Prakṛtis are not eligible for arising. Therefore, only 105 Prakṛtis arise. Similarly, in the five divisions of the third hell, the general Prakṛtis are also considered the same.

In the Tichons, like humans, there are 71 Prakṛtis, including Manusyakti and two others, Ubhagotra and Manushayau. By reducing these three Prakṛtis and combining the five Prakṛtis of Nichakottra, Tishgati, and two others, Tichayu and Udyot, there are 76 Prakṛtis that are eligible for birth.

In the Bhoga and Sure, like humans, there are 78 Prakṛtis, including Manusyakti and four others, Manushayau, Rishabhanas, Sanhanan. By reducing these six Prakṛtis and combining the four Prakṛtis of Devagati and others, Devapu, there are 77 Prakṛtis that are eligible for birth. However, in the Devas, there is no birth of Strived, and in the Devanganas, there is no birth of Purushaved. Therefore, in the Devas and Devanganas, only 76 Prakṛtis should be considered eligible for birth.

There is only one Asanyata Gunasthan in the Vimanas. Therefore, there are 50 Prakṛtis that are eligible for birth, similar to the Avirat Sunasthan of the Deshas. In the Bhavanatrik (Bhavanakasi, Dhyantar, Jyotishi) Devas, Devis, and Kalpavamini women, there are 77 Prakṛtis, like the general Devas, with 46 Prakṛtis eligible for birth without Strived or Purushaved. However, there is no birth of Devanupurvi in the Chaudhe Achira Gunasthan, because a Samyagdristi does not get born in the Bhavanatrik after death. Therefore, there are only 66 Prakṛtis that are eligible for birth in the Chal Gunasthan of the Bhavanatrik and Kalpavamini Devis, and also in their Sasare.

Two, ordinary, one-sensory, and heat-receiving nature, being me, are capable of giving rise to 517 entities.

In the seven yogas, namely four manoyogas and three vachanayogas, the central, vikalatriya, sthavar, etc., four anupurvi - these 13 natures do not exist, therefore 101 natures are capable of arising.

**Anubhayavachan** yoga, with 106 natures, including vikalatriya, gives rise to 113 entities.

In **Audarik Kayayoga**, out of 112, the following 13 natures do not exist: Aharak sharir yugal, deshyu, krimshatk, manushy anupurvi, liyanchanupurvi, apariapt, narakas - leaving 106 natures capable of arising.

**Audarik Mishr Kaprayog**, with 101 natures from before, after adding pariapt and removing the following 12 natures: mindhprakriti, tyanimishki, svaraday, bihayogaliyugad, paradhatadi charin - leaves 68 natures capable of arising.

In the fourth **Avirat Gunasthan**, anadeya yugal, durbhag, nayesakaved, strived - these do not arise. The dissolution of these natures should happen in the **Sasvadan Gunasthan**. In the **Mithyatva Gunasthan**, mithyasth, sukshmatray - these two natures are dissolved.

In **Sasvadan**, 14 natures like anantanubandhi, in **Asanayat**, 44 natures like apratyakhyana, and in **Samogikevarali**, 36 natures - knowing the arising and dissolution of these is important.

## Sutiya Karmagrantha: Appendix

In the Vaikriya Kayayoga, out of the 77 Prakṛtis similar to Devagati, by reducing Devaspūrvi and adding four - Narakayu, Narakagati, Huṇḍa Sansthāna, Napusakaved, Ashubha Vihayogati, Durbhaga, and ten - Nīcha Gotr, there are 86 Prakṛtis that are Udayayogya.

In the Vaikriya Misna Kayayoga, out of the 86 Prakṛtis of Vaikriya, the pair of Minamohaniya, Paradhata, and Svar-Vihayogati are not Ubayarūpa, meaning these seven Prakṛtis are not Udayayogya, leaving 76 Prakṛtis that are Udayayogya. Even in these, in the Sasvadana Gunasthāna, Huṇḍa Sansthāna, Napusakaved, Durbhaga, Anadeya, Ayash-Kirti, Marakkamati, Parakayu, and Nīcha Gotr do not arise, because the Sasvadana Gunasthāna does not lead to Naraka after death, but their arising remains in the Aviрата Gunasthāna. In Sasvadana, there is Vyuchchitti of five Prakṛtis - Strived and Anantānubandhī Chatuva. In Adhirati, there is Vyuchchitti of thirteen Prakṛtis - Apratyākhyāna Kṣaya Chatuka, Kriyatika, Devagati, Marakagati, Devayu, Naravayu, and Durbhagatrik.

In the Ahārak Kayayoga, out of the 81 Prakṛtis of the sixth Gunasthāna, there is no Uday of twenty Prakṛtis - Pratyākhyātrik, Masakaved, Strived, Aprashastha Vihayogati, Duḥsarkar, six Sanhanana, Audārika Vik, and the last five Sansthāna.

In the Ahārak Misna Kayayoga, out of these 61 Prakṛtis, by reducing two - Musvar, Paradhata, and four - Prashastha Vihayogati, there are 57 Prakṛtis that are Udayayogya.

If one drinks the poison of the six substances (gil, styan, dvitrik), the six institutions, and the six consolidations, then one will be born in hell. 

**Verse 320**
In the Purusha Veda, out of the 122 principles, 15 principles are not present:  the stationary, the hell-bound, the two-fold hell-bound, the Tirthankara, the one-sensed, the three-fold विकल, the female, the neuter, the sun, and the hell-bound. Therefore, 107 principles are capable of arising.

**Verse 321**
In the female Veda, out of the 107 principles, the three principles of the food-body, the gum, and the male are reduced, and the female is added, making 105 principles capable of arising. In the neuter Veda, out of the 122 principles, eight principles are reduced: the two-fold heavenly, the food-body, the female, the male, the heavenly, and the Tirthankara. Therefore, 114 principles are capable of arising.

In the Leshya Marg, in the Krishna and Neel Leshyas, there are 116 Prakruti's useful for Siddha, according to their respective Munasthan. But in the Mithyaishti Gunasthan, one should understand that even before Naskaana, there is Chhin. In the Saasadan Gunasthan, there is Vyuchhitti of Devathu, Devagati, Devanupurvi, and Liyantraanupuchi. Similarly, in Kapareta Leylya, there is Vyuchhitti of Naramanapurvi and Tiryanchanupurvi in the Kinna Abhirata Munasthan.

In the Tejo Leshya and other three Shubh Leyyas, there is no Uday of 13 Prakruti's, namely Aattap, Ekendriya, Vikalendriyanik, Sthavar Badi Par, Parakgasiddhik, Narakayu, and Tiryancha Nupurvi, out of 122, according to their respective Sthan. Therefore, there is Uday of 109 Prakruti's. Even in that, there is no Uday of Manusyanupurvi in the Mithyaishti and other two Gunasthan.

And in Upanamsamyavasn, Narakayanupurvi and other three Anupurvi and Aharakdrik Prakruti's are not Udayyogya.

The third Karma Granth, the appendix called "Desha Samyata", states that a person with perfect vision (Samyagdrishti) is in the state of "Gunasthan". Therefore, the three natures of Liyankayu, Udyot, and Tiryaagati do not arise. Hence, the arising and ceasing of these three occur in the continuous Gunasthan.

"Meshanam sagunoss sanissavi tyi tavasharanam. Thavarasuhami givigalam asaninodi ya ga manuducc." (330)

The three natures of Mithyaastra, Saasadan, and Misra Samyaktva, have their own Gunasthan, which should be understood. For example, in Mithyaatva, 117 Pramatis are capable of arising.

In the Sankhi Margana, six Prakalis are not capable of arising: Atap, Sadharan, Sthanar, Sukshma, Ekendir, Vikalendriyadik, and the previously mentioned Tirthankar Prakupti. These are excluded from the general 122 Prakalis.

In the Amaanji, the following 26 Prakritis are not capable of arising: Manushya Galivika, Gotra, Vakriya Sharira, Shatka, Panch Sanhanan, Panch Sansthan, Prashast Vihar Yogakti, Subhag Adi Teen, Marma Adi Seen Aayu.

Therefore, subtracting these 26 Prakritis from the 117 of Misthaashti, we are left with 61 Prakritis that are capable of arising.

"Ahaar Maya Ahare Saguno Navarin Mantranupubbi Ko." (331)

"Kamme Va Anahare, Payadin Udayamevamadese." (332)

The four Anushi Prakritis do not arise. Therefore, there are 118 Prakritis capable of arising.

In the Anadarak state, 66 Prakritis are capable of arising, similar to the Kama Kayayog.

In the states of Satta, Swaamitva, Pati, and other Marganas, the four Prakritis of Prakriti, Sthiti, Anubhag, and Pradesh are...

## Aarfe Office: Commentary on Digambar Karma-Sahitya 15.1

**The truth of the natures, taking into account the differences, is being stated in the proper order. To explain the essence, the definition sutra is stated first:**

**"Tiththahāra jugayam savvam tityam ṇa micchhgaadittie. Tastammiyāṇam vagguṇṭhāṇam ṇa sambhavadi |||333|||**

In the three guṇasthānas, Mithyādr̥ṣṭi, Sāsādana, and Miśra, the Tīrthankara and Āhāraka are not present in the same time in the first, all three are not present in the same time in the second, and in the Miśra, the Tīrthankara nature is not present. That is, in Mithyātvam, there are 148 natures in relation to the various beings, in Sāsādana, there are 145 natures because all three are not present in the same time, and in the Miśra guṇasthāna, there are 140 natures because the Tīrthankara nature is not present. Because these guṇasthānas of Mithyātvam etc. are not possible for beings with these inherent natures.

**"Cattārivi khettai āugabandheṇa hoi sammatam. Aṇuvad mahadāi ga lahai devāugaṁ motu |||334|||**

In all four fields, samyag-sthāna is attained by the auga-bandha, but except for the blind of the devāyu, the other three cannot hold the aṇuvrata and mahāvratas with the bandha of the māsu, because there are no pure results due to the cause.

**"Girayatirikta surāun satte na hi desasayalachadakhavaga. Ayadacchakkam tu aṇa aṇiyatṭīkaraṇa śrarimmi |||335||| Jugavam saṁjogiyā puṇo tri aṇiyatṭīkaraṇa bahubhāga. Atra seat fee misse samm khavedikame |||336|||**

When there are beings in hell, the animal realm, and the human realm, there are no devavrata, sat (mahāvrat), and kṣak categories. And the seven natures, starting with the bandhi, who have the four guṇasthānas of asan̄yatā etc., become kṣayika samyagdṛṣṭi in order by removing the aṇiyatṭīkaraṇa. Of those seven, the first, the anantānubandhītuka, has the aṇivṛttikaraṇa form of the results, which is the end of the time of the end of the results, and is disintegrated only once at the end of the time.

##  Translation:

**Third Karma Granth: Parist**

The twelve *Kavaay* forms of *Anantaanubandhi Chatuk*, such as *Apratyaakhyana*, etc., undergo transformation, leaving behind only one part of the *Anivrittikaran* time, while the remaining parts are filled with the nature of *Mithyatva*, *Mishch*, and *Samyaktya* in succession, starting from the first time. Thus, there is a decrease in the decay of the seven natures. Here, in the three *Gunasthanas*, the nature of *Gaya* and *Asan* is present, and from the seventh *Gunasthan* onwards, the *Upshama Samyak Hari* and *Kshayopahsama Sampadristi* both have the presence of *Anantaanubandhi*, etc., in the fourth *Gunasthan*, resulting in the presence of 148 natures. In the fifth *Gunasthan*, due to the absence of *Narakaaya*, there are 141 natures. In the *Pramat Gunasthan*, due to the absence of both *Naraka* and *Tiyavaayu*, there are 146 natures. In the *Aparamat* *Gunasthan*, there are also 146 natures. Due to the decay of the seven natures, namely *Anantaanubandhi Chatuk* and *Darshanmohavik*, in the *Kshayik Samyakdristi*, there is a decrease of seven each. In the *Apoovarnakaran Gunasthan*, there are two categories. In the *Apak* category, there are 13 natures, as the decay of the seven natures of *Anantaanubandhi Chatuk* had already occurred, and the presence of *Marak*, *Liyanch*, and *Vayu* is absent.

**Solkkimikarak Chadd Sekk Badare Ado Ekkam. Khine Solamajoge Bayattari Teruvartete ||337||**

In the *Aniyattikaran*, there is a decrease in the presence of *Prakashiya* from 16, 8, 1, 1, and 6 in succession, and in the final part, there is only one *Sanavyujichchhanna*. In the tenth *Gunasthan*, there is only one *Nyuchit*. In the eleventh, there is no *Yogyatha*. In the twelfth, in the *Antsamar*, there are 16 natures present. In the *Sayogik Kevali*, there is no decrease in any nature. In the two times at the end of the *Ayogik Gunasthan*, there are 72 natures in the first time and 13 natures in the second time.

## Bombari Ownership: The Depth of Digambar Karma Literature

**Mithyadristi** (false view) and other **Apuurvakaran** (primordial) **Gunasthanas** (stages of spiritual progress) are devoid of **Aam** (matter) from **0** to **31**, **0** to **1**, **22**, and **10** respectively. This means these **Prakritis** (principles) do not exist. In the first part of **Ativritikaran** (transgression), there are **10** **Prakritis**, in the second part **16**, and in the third part and onwards, there are **Jaad** (material) **Prakritis**. Recognizing these **Prakritis** as **Asatya** (false) and subtracting them from all **Satya** (true) **Prakritis**, the remaining **Prakritis** are **Satya** (true) **Prakritis** in their respective **Gunasthanas**. (This is what the valiant **Shree Mahavira Swami**, who is devoid of any support, has said.)

**153**

In **Aavaran** (covering) also, one should understand the order of **Kshapana** (destruction) like **Kshapana** in **Kshapana** (destruction) itself. However, it is special that between **Sanjwalana Kshaya** (burning passion) and **Purushaved** (knowledge of the soul), there are two **Aavaran** (covering) and **Pratyaatma Aavaran** (covering of the soul) **Kshayas** (passions) related to **Krodha** (anger) etc. So, first, one should reduce them to **Upaaner** (subdued), and then reduce **Sanjwalana Kshaya** (burning passion) etc. This means that in the **Upshama** (subduing) category, like the **Apak** (lower) category, the **Upshama** (subduing) of the eight **Kshayas** (passions) in the second part of the ninth **Gunasthan** (stage of spiritual progress) does not happen, but it happens before **Purushaved** (knowledge of the soul) and **Sanjwalana** (burning). And its order is such that after **Purushaved** (knowledge of the soul), the **Upshama** (subduing) of both **Rveersire** (pride) and **Pratyakhyan** (rejection) happens, and then the **Upshama** (subduing) of **Sankhyam** (attachment) etc. One should understand the same order in **Maan** (ego) etc.

**Tiryagati** (animal realm) has no **Tiryak** (animal) **Prakriti** (principle). In **Tarak** (heavenly), **Tiryantra** (animal realm), **Manushya** (human), and **Devagati** (divine realm), there are **Bhujyaman Narak** (suffering hell) and **Badyaman** (bound) **Manushyaayu** (human lifespan) in order. These three **Aayu** (lifespans) are **Bhujyaman** (suffering) **Tiryavaayu** (animal lifespan) and **Badyaman** (bound) **Narak** (hell), **Tiryach** (animal), **Manushya** (human), and **Devaayu** (divine lifespan). These four are **Bhujyaman** (suffering) **Manushyaayu** (human lifespan) and **Badyaman** (bound) **Narak** (hell), **Tiryach** (animal), **Manushya** (human), and **Devaayu** (divine lifespan). These four are **Bhujyaman** (suffering) **Devaayu** (divine lifespan) and **Badyaman** (bound) **Tiryantra** (animal realm) and **Manushyaayu** (human lifespan). These three **Aayu** (lifespans) are **Karm** (karmic) **Prakritis** (principles) that are capable of existing.

## Appendix to the Karma Granth:

**Hell:** In the hell realm, all 63 qualities are present, making 157 natures eligible. The Tīrthankara nature is present until the third hell, while the human nature is present until the sixth hell.

**Animal Realm:** In the animal realm, the qualities are present as in the human realm, but the Tīrthankara nature is absent, making 147 natures eligible.

**The Five-Senses:** In the five-sense animals, the qualities are present as usual, but the animal realm does not have the hell or god nature.

**Humans:** In the three types of humans, the qualities are present as usual, but in the "Lampa-paryāpta" humans, the hell, god, and Tīrthankara natures are absent, making 145 natures eligible.

**Gods:** In the god realm, the qualities are present as usual, but the hell nature is absent, making 147 natures eligible. The animal nature is present until the "Sāhābara" heaven. The "Bhavana-nik" gods and "Kalpa-vāsinī" women do not have the Tīrthankara nature.

**Five-Sense and One-Sense:** In the five-sense and one-sense beings, the qualities are present as usual. In the remaining beings, from the one-sense to the "Aturi-indra" beings, and in the "sthāvara-kāya" (stationary beings) like earth, etc., the qualities are present as in the "Lampa-paryāpta" humans, making 145 natures eligible.

**Tejas-kāya and Vāyu-kāya:** In the "Tejas-kāya" (fire beings) and "Vāyu-kāya" (air beings), the human nature is absent, making 144 natures eligible.

Sandhāri Svāmiṣ: Perspective on Digambara Karmasāhitya
155 Understand. There is also an 'uddesa' (purpose) of the prakṛtis (karmic matter) in the indriya (sense organs) and kāya mārganā (bodily activities). In the yogamārga (path of spiritual practice),
Puṇṇekārasajoge sāhārayamissakevi saguṇoghaṃ |
Vaiguḍḍhiyamisse vi ya bhāvari ṇa māṇusatirikkāū 535||
The sattva (pure) prakṛtis should be known in the 11 pūrṇa yogas (complete spiritual practices) and āhārakamiśra yoga (mixed spiritual practice) according to their respective guṇasthānas (stages of spiritual development). In the vaikriyika yoga (transformation of body), the sattva prakṛtis should be known as in the śuddhasthāna (pure stage), but the specialty here is that the manuṣyāyu (human lifespan) and tiryañcāyu (animal lifespan) prakṛtis are not present, so there are 146 saptāyogya (seven-fold) prakṛtis.

Orālamissa joge ogha suṇiraya-āuṇa patya |
Tamssivamagge sira kammavi saguṇo || 353||
In the audārika-miśra yoga (mixed physical body), the sattva prakṛtis are present as in the general guṇasthānas, but since the devāyu (divine lifespan) and narakāyu (hellish lifespan) prakṛtis are not present, there are 143 saptāyogya prakṛtis. The sīpamkara (false belief) prakṛti is not present in the first guṇasthāna of the audārika-miśra mithyādṛṣṭi (false belief), so there are 143 prakṛtis.

In the pārmaṇakāvayoga (transformation of body), 148 prakṛtis should be known as per the guṇasthānas. The āhāra mārganā (food intake) is paryāpta (complete) from the devas (celestial beings).

Vedādāhāroti ya samuṇodha gari saṃḍhayīkhavage |
Kiṇhagasuhatilessiyabāmevi ga titthagarasaṃ 1354||
The tīrthaṅkara-rasa (essence of the Tīrthaṅkaras) is mixed in the āhāra (food) of the abhavasiddha (liberated) gṛhastha (householder). The tīrthaṅkara-rasa is not present in the āhāracatuṣka (four types of food) of the asaṃjñī-jīva (unconscious being).

The specific result of the prakṛti whose karmic bondage was done, transforms into another prakṛti form, i.e., the fruit is not experienced, but it is first destroyed, which is called udvelaṇa (suppression). The udvelaṇayogya (suppressible) prakṛtis are 13 - āhārakadrika, samyaktva-mohanīya, miśra-mohanīya, devapratyāpanna, narakagati-ādi-para, ucca-motra, manuṣyagati-trika.

The **sṛtīya kamanandha** should be understood as having a general **sattva** according to its own **guṇasthāna**, from **parishiṣṭa veda mārgṇā** to **āhārak mārgṇā**. However, there is a special feature: **napusakabeva** and **strīya apak** category beings do not have the **sattva** of **tīrthaṅkara** nature. Similarly, **kṛṣṇa** and **nola**, these two **leṇyā** with **mithyādṛṣṭi**, and **pīta** etc. three **śubha leśyā** with **mithyādṛṣṭi**, also do not have the **sattva** of **tīrthaṅkara** nature.  _**Abhaya jīva**s do not have the **sattva** of the seven **prakṛti**s: **nīkara**, **mamyava**, **madhamodaniya**, and **āhārak caturṣka** (**āhārak śarīra**, **āhārak angopāṅga**, **āhārak bandhana**, **āhārak saṅghāta**). **Asanjnī jīva** does not have the **sattva** of **tīrthaṅkara** nature._
In **anāhārak mārgṇā**, the **prakṛti**s should be understood as having **māva** like **kāmaṇ kāyayoga**.

##  Svetambara-Digambara Karma-Sahitya Similarities and Differences

Here we present the similarities and differences in the views of Svetambara and Digambara Karma-Sahitya regarding the bondage of karma:

**(1)**  There is agreement between the Patamar and Digambara Karma-Sahitya regarding the non-bondage of Aayubandha in the third Gunasthan. The Svetambara Karma-Sahitya does not consider the bondage of Aayukarma in the third Gunasthan. This is also the view of the Digambara Karma-Sahitya.

**(2)**  There is a difference of opinion in the Karmagrantha regarding the bondage of 64 Prakṛtis in the second Gunasthan in the case of Prithvikaaya and other Margana. However, the Gommatasar Karmakanda only considers the bondage of 64 Prakṛtis.

**(3)**  The Karmagrantha considers the first and second Gunasthan in the case of the Ekendriya to Chakshusindriya Par Indriya Margana and the Prithvi, Jal, and Vanaspati - these three Kaya Margana. The Gommatasar Karmakanda also accepts this view. However, the Sarvartha Siddhikar has a different opinion on this matter. They consider only the first Gunasthan in the case of the Ekendriya and other four Indriya Margana and the Prithvikaaya and other five Kaya Margana.

**(4)**  Regarding the acceptance of Gunasthan in Ekendriya, there are two views in the Svetambara sect. The theoretical view considers only the first Gunasthan, while the Karmagrantha view considers the first and second Gunasthan. The same two views are also seen in the Digambara sect. The Sarvartha Siddhi and Bhojiva-kanda represent the theoretical view, while the Gommatasar Karmakanda represents the Karmagrantha view.

**(5)**  In the Audarikamishrakaayayoga Margana, the bondage of 176 Prakṛtis in the Mithyatva Gunasthan is considered in the Gommatasar Karmakanda, similar to the Karmagrantha.

**(6)**  In the Audarikamishrakaayayoga Margana, the Aviratasamyashti...

Page #186:

**Regarding the bondage of specific natures, the opinion of Dave is also supported by the Go. Karmakanda.**

(7) The Karmagranth in the Aharakamisna Kayayog considers the bondage of 63 natures, but the Go. Karmakanda considers the bondage of 62 natures.

(8) The Karmagranth and Go. Karmakanda both consider the bondage of 75 natures in the three Leshyas of Krishna, etc., and the Sanvantik Pas also considers the bondage of 75 natures.

The Karmagranth and Go. Karmakanda have the same ownership of the bondage of Shushlaleshya.

In the third Karmagranth, the three Leshyas of Krishna, etc., are considered in the first four Gunasthanas. Similarly, the opinion of Gommatsar and Sarvarthasiddhi is also the same.

(9) The Svetambar sect considers 12 Devalokas (Sasvay. A. 4, Su. 20 commentary), but the Digambar sect considers 16 (Tasvarth 074, Su. 18 Sarvarthasiddhi commentary). According to the Svetambar sect, there are six Devalokas from Sanatkumar to Sahasrar, but according to the Digambar sect, there are 10. Of these, Amoत्तर, Kapishth, Shukra, and Shatar are four Devalokas that are not considered in the Svetambar sect.

In the Svetambar sect, only Padmaleshya is considered from the third Sanatsfumar to the fifth Brahmalok, and Shuklaleshya is considered from the sixth Lantak onwards. However, in the Digambar sect, Tejalaleshya and Padmaleshya are considered in the two Devalokas of Sanatkumar and Mahendra; Padmaleshya is considered in the four Devalokas of Brahmalok, Brahmottar, Lantav, and Kapishth; Padmashuklaleshya is considered in the four Devalokas of Shukra, Mahashukra, Shatar, and Sahasrar; and only Shuklaleshya is considered in all the Devalokas of Anant, etc., and Ghosha.

(10) In both the Svetambar and Digambar sects, the Tejasvi Vayukayik Jiva is considered a Sthavar due to the rise of the Sthavar Karma. However, in Svetambar literature, they are also called Pras. In Tattvarthabhavy Diika, etc., Tejaskaik and Vayukaik are called 'Gatinasa', and in Acharangnithucti and its commentary, they are called 'Sandi Asa'. However, the meaning of both these terms is...

Page #187:
---------------------------
Pesambara-Digambara Karma-Sahitya's Similar-Dissimilar Aspects

15. There is no difference. The meaning of both is that in the six Vayukayika, there is no Asanam Karma-Uday like the Indriya, etc., but because of the form of movement being Sakti, it is considered Vastu. In Dvi-Indriya, etc., there is Vastu of Asanam Karma-Uday and movement action form in two ways.

But in Digambara literature, Teja-Kayika, Vayukayika beings are called only Sthavara, not Prasna, with special consideration.

(11) In Pancha-Sangraha (written by Shri Chandrashi Mahatara), in the Audarika-Anmadh Kayayoga, the same as the Karma-Grantha, the mind of Tri-Ayush and Manushya-Ayush is considered.

(12) In Karma-Grantha, 13 types of Bandha are said in Aharak Kama. But the Pancha-Sangrahakar's opinion is different on this subject. They consider 57 types of Bandha in Aharak Kayayoga.

It is hoped that the above differences in opinion will be helpful to the inquisitive in their in-depth study.

## Third Karma Chapter: Appendix

**Insufficient, Tich, Insufficient Human's Bond-Ownership of the 106 General Bondable Natures**

**Gunasthan First (Mithyatva)**: The 106 natures are devoid of the 11 natures of the **Sthirthakar Namakarma (1)** and **Naraka-Ayu (11)**.  **Am-Punah An**. **Bandha-Vislesha**

**X**

**IMGAM**

The meaning of "Insufficient" here is from **Sandi-Insufficient**, not **Karan-Insufficient**. The reason for taking the meaning of **Labdhi-Insufficient** is that **Karan-Insufficient** humans can bind the **Tirthankara Namakarma**, but **Labdhi-Insufficient** cannot. Therefore, **Tirthankara Namakarma** is not included in the general bondable natures in relation to **Labdhi-Insufficient**.

##  Time as a Factor in the Path of Liberation:

In the Gommatasara Karmakanda, 70 and 71 prakritis are considered to be capable of binding in the fourth gunasthan.  _The solution to this is that in verse 15, the term 'anajadisaai' should not only refer to the twenty-four prakritis like Ananannunandhi Chatushk, but also include the prakritis like 'Aai' (manushyatvika) by taking the word 'Aai' into account. This removes any doubt. In this case, 70 and 71 prakritis can be considered capable of binding in the fourth gunasthan._

Even after accepting this solution, the question arises as to why the Karmagrantha mentions the binding of 75 prakritis. This needs to be considered.

According to the principles of Audarikamishra Kayayoga, the fifth and sixth gunasthanas are considered. In this regard, the Sikhanta's opinion is that just as Audarik Kayayoga is called Audarik Mishra Kayayoga because it is mixed with Karman Kayayoga until the body of Audarik Kayayoga is fully developed, similarly, the Vaikriya and Aharak bodies should be considered Audarik Mishra Kayayoga until they are fully developed and mixed with the Audarik body in their initial stages.

The Sivanta's perspective is acceptable, and from that perspective, the fifth and sixth gunasthanas can be considered as Audarik Mishra Kayayoga. However, the Karmagrantha does not consider the Vaikriya and Aharak bodies as Audarik Mishra Kayayoga, giving priority to the Labdhiabhyudaya body. Only the yoga that arises from the cooperation of both Karman and Audarik bodies should be called Audarik Mishra Kayayoga, and this yoga is found in the first, second, fourth, and seventh gunasthanas.

Therefore, the binding of these four gunasthanas has been mentioned.

Page #204:
---------------------------
## Third Karma Group: Appendix

**Karma Kayoga and Anaharaka** are bound by the same 112 Gunasthanas: 1, 2, 4, 13 (four Gunasthanas).

**Aharaka** (with 8 types of births: Deva, Naraka, Manushya, Tiryanch) are devoid of these 112 Gunasthanas.

**Bound by:**
* **Punarbhava** (rebirth)
* **Andha-Vicched** (blindness)
* **Sookshmanama** (12) to **Sanhanan** (24) - 13 Gunasthanas
* **Tirthankara** to **Devatrik** (divine beings) - 24 Gunasthanas
* **Ananna** (non-violence) to **Sirvadhanapurvi** (48) - 24 Gunasthanas

**Note:** Anaharaka Margana is found in Gunasthanas 1, 3, 4, 13 and 14. Karma Kayoga is bound by the same four Gunasthanas: 1, 2, 4, and 13. This is because in the 14th Gunasthan, there is no possibility of Karma binding due to the complete absence of causes for Karma binding. In the remaining Gunasthanas, the causes of binding (Mithyasvad etc.) remain active. Therefore, Karma Kayoga and Anaharaka Margana are bound by the same four Gunasthanas.

Page #205:

**Machines Demonstrating Blindness in the Path**

There are two meanings of *Anaharaka*: 1 - Complete cessation of the intake of karmas due to the complete cessation of the causes of karma-bandha. This state is attained in the fourteenth *guṇasthāna* of *ayogikevali*. Therefore, the fourteenth *guṇasthāna* is considered *Anaharaka* in the *mārgaṇā*. 2 - The state in which only the *pugaḷa-vargaṇā* of the *phārmika-kāya-yoga* is taken is called the *Anaharaka* state. From this perspective, the worldly being now leaves one body and travels by *vigraha-gati* to obtain a new birth. In that state, *karmāṇ-yoga* remains, and other *auvārika-kāya* etc. do not remain as *prātha-varmaṇā*. These beings have only the first, second, and fourth *guṇasthāna*.
T
*Yogī-sevā-guṇasthāna* is included in *Anaharaka-mārgaṇā* because when the atoms of *āyu-karma* are more than the other karmas, seven actions are performed to make them equal to the state of *āyu-karma*. In this *samuddhāta* state, only *karmāṇ-yoga* remains, and the karmas in the *afte* state are made equal to the state of *āyu-karma*. This is done by the *sāva-nīya-karma-bandha*. Therefore, the thirteenth *guṇasthāna* is included in *Anaharaka-mārgaṇā*.

##  Chapter 178: Appendix
###  Bond-Ownership of Aharak and Aharak-Mishra Kayayog

According to the Karmagrantha, the bond-ownership of Aharak and Aharak-Mishra Kayayog is like the sixth Prammatta-Samyata Gunasthan, which has 63 Prakruti, as mentioned in the general context and in relation to the Gunasthan.

However, the Pancha-Sangraha Sapta-Tika states that Aharak Kayayog has two Gunasthan, the sixth and the seventh, while Aharak-Mishra Kayayog has only the sixth Gunasthan. Therefore, the bond of Aharak Kayayog should be considered as 63 Prakruti in the sixth Gunasthan, 57 in the seventh Gunasthan, and 66 if there is no bond of Devayu.

The basis for this statement is that the seventh Gunasthan is the bond-worthy Gunasthan for the Aharak body, while the sixth is the Ud-yogya (suitable for effort). When the fourteen Purva-dhari perform Aharak body, they experience the sixth Gunasthan due to the involvement of Pramada (negligence) in utilizing the Labdhi (gain). At the beginning of the Aharak body, it is mixed with Bodarik (materiality), meaning that the sixth Gunasthan exists in both Aharak and Aharak-Mishra Kayayog. However, later, due to the power of Vishuddhi (purification), it reaches the seventh Gunasthan, where only Aharak Yog remains, and the Gunasthan is the seventh.

Therefore, it is appropriate to consider the sixth and seventh Gunasthan for Aharak Kayayog and the sixth Gunasthan for Aharak-Mishra Kayayog. Consequently, all Aharak Kayayog would have 63 and 17 Prakruti, while Aharak-Mishra Kayayog would have 63 Prakruti.

In the Gommatasar Karmakanda, 63 Prakruti are considered bond-worthy for Aharak-Mishra Kayayog, and 62 Prakruti are considered bond-worthy for Aharak Kayayog, considering the bond of Devayu. The reason for considering the bond of Devayu is the rule that Ayus (life span) does not bind in the mixed state.

Special Although it is possible for Kriya and Vaishyamishra Kayayog to have the fifth and sixth Gunasthan in comparison to the Sandijanya Kriyasharira, the reason for considering one to four Gunasthan in Kriya Kayayog and 1, 2, 4 Gunasthan in Vaishyamishra Kayayog is that here the natural Bhavaprasthaya Vaikriya Sharira has been considered. Therefore, four Gunasthan have been considered in Kiya Kayayog and 1, 2, these three Gunasthan have been considered in Kriyamishra Kayayog.

## Appendix:

**1. General Differences between the Paths of the Vedas and the Path of Conduct:**

The three common differences between the paths of the Vedas and the Path of Conduct are: anger, pride, deceit, and greed. Of these, anger, pride, and deceit are the 120 binding natures. There are nine stages of qualities, starting from false belief and ending with non-obstruction. According to the above mantra, each stage of quality has 120 binding natures.

**2. The Fourth General Difference in the Path of Conduct: Greed:**

The fourth general difference in the Path of Conduct, greed, has 120 binding natures. There are ten stages of qualities, starting from false belief and ending with subtle perception. The ownership of these binding natures should be understood as mentioned above.

The four infinite-binding passions (anger, pride, deceit, and greed) are found in the first two stages of qualities. The Tirthankara and the Aharaka cannot be bound by these passions because they have renounced the appropriate nature, and the binding of the Aharaka is dependent on the community. However, the infinite-binding passions do not have right faith or right conduct. Therefore, when these three natures are reduced, there are 117 binding natures remaining, and the number of binding natures in the stages of qualities is reduced to 117 in the first stage and 101 in the second stage.

The four passions of the non-returning covering (anger, pride, deceit, and greed) exist from the beginning until the stage of the holder of the four qualities. Therefore, there are four stages of qualities in this passion. Even with the presence of this passion, the Tirthankara can be bound due to right faith, but the Aharaka cannot be bound due to the absence of complete renunciation of conduct. Therefore, since the Aharaka cannot be bound, there are 118 binding natures remaining, and the number of binding natures in the stages of qualities is reduced to 117, 101, 74, and 77 in the first four stages of qualities, respectively.

The four passions of the rejecting covering (anger, pride, deceit, and greed) have one-sided conduct, and therefore there are five stages of qualities in this passion. The Tirthankara can be bound by this passion, but the Aharaka cannot be bound. Therefore, there are 118 binding natures remaining, and the number of binding natures in the stages of qualities is reduced to 117, 101, 74, 77, and 67 in the first five stages of qualities, respectively.

Page #211:
---------------------------
## In Bhavas (States of Being)

**Regarding the Yantras (Instruments) of the Six Sanjvalana Kashayas (Afflictions)**

* **Anger, Pride, and Deceit:** These arise from Mithyatva (False Belief) and continue until the Nivriti Gunasthan (State of Liberation). They are present in all Gunasthanas (States of Being).
* **Greed:** This arises until the tenth Sukhsamgraya Gunasthan (State of Subtle Collection).

Therefore, there are 120 general Bandha-yogya (Capable of Binding) Prakritis (Substances).  

**Regarding the Ownership of Bandha (Binding) in the Gunasthanas:**

* **Anger, Pride, and Deceit:** Their ownership of Bandha is similar to the Bandha-adhikarya (Right to Bind) from the first to the ninth Gunasthanas.  The respective numbers are 11.5, 101, etc.
* **Greed:** It remains until the tenth Gunasthan. Therefore, until the ninth Gunasthan, it is similar to the binding of Anger, Pride, and Deceit. In the tenth Gunasthan, it has 17 Prakritis.

## In the Gyanamarg (Path of Knowledge)

**Regarding the Different Types of Agyan (Ignorance)**

* **Mati Agyan (Intellectual Ignorance), Shruta Agyan (Scriptural Ignorance), and Avadhi Agyan (Clairvoyance Ignorance):** These have two or three Gunasthanas at the beginning. Since there is no Samyaktva (Right Faith) or Charitra (Right Conduct), the Tirthankara and Aharadrik (Those who consume food) are not capable of binding these three Prakritis. Therefore, there are 115 general Bandha-yogya Prakritis. The Bandha-adhikarya in these three Gunasthanas is 110, 101, and 74 respectively.

**Regarding the Four Marganas (Paths)**

* **Mati Gyan (Intellectual Knowledge), Shruta Gyan (Scriptural Knowledge), Avadhi Gyan (Clairvoyance Knowledge), and Avadhi Darshan (Clairvoyance Vision):** These have nine Gunasthanas from the fourth Avira (Uninterrupted) to the twelfth Kshina Moh (Subdued Delusion). Since the Aharadrik can bind in these, there are 76 Prakritis, which are the 7.5 general Prakritis plus the Aharadrik. The Bandha-adhikarya in these Gunasthanas is 77, 67, etc., until the twelfth.

**Regarding the Manah Paryaya Gyan (Knowledge of Mental Transformations)**

* **This arises from the sixth Prabhamanayat (Illuminated by the Light of Knowledge) to the twelfth Kshina Moh (Subdued Delusion).** Therefore, there are seven Gunasthanas. Since the Aharadrik can bind in these, there are 63 and 64 general Bandha-yogya Prakritis. The Bandha-adhikarya in these Gunasthanas is from the sixth to the twelfth.

**Regarding the Two Marganas (Paths) of Kevala Gyan (Omniscience) and Kevala Darshan (Omniscient Vision)**

* **These have the final two Gunasthanas: Ayogika Kevali (Non-Functional Omniscient) and Yogika Kevali (Functional Omniscient).** In the Ayogika Kevali Gunasthan, there is no Bandha-karan (Cause of Binding), so no Prakriti can be bound.

Page #212:
---------------------------
## Chapter 184: Appendix to the Third Karma-Ghatya

**1.** In the **Yoga-Lila** (state of liberation), only one **Prakriti** (nature) is bound, which is **Saata-Vedaniya** (pertaining to the seven senses).

**2.** The **Darshan-Marg** (path of perception) exists from the **Kshetra-Kshudarshan** (perception of the field of action) and **Adarshan** (non-perception) stages of **Kshaya-Upa-Shमिक** (destruction of karma) until the twelfth **Gunasthan** (stage of spiritual progress). Therefore, their ownership is similar to the general **Bandha-Adhikar** (right to bind) in the **Gunasthanas**. In other words, the general **Bandha-Yogya** (capable of being bound) are 120, and in the **Gunasthanas**, they are respectively 117, 101, 74, 77, etc., until the twelfth **Gunasthan**.

**3.** The **Samyama-Marg** (path of restraint) has four **Gunasthanas** in the **Avirati** (non-stopping) stage. In the fourth **Gunasthan**, the **Samyaktva** (right faith) can bind the **Tirthankara-Nama** (name of a Tirthankara). However, since **Feng** (a specific type of karma) is not present, the **Aharak-Drik** (pertaining to food and drink) is not bound in the four **Vasapeksha** (dependent) stages. Therefore, 118 **Prakritis** are generally **Bandha-Yogya**, and in the **Gunasthanas**, they are respectively 117, 101, 74, 77, similar to the **Bandha-Adhikar**.

**4.** The **Samayik** and **Chheda-Upa-Sthaniya** (two types of restraint) are found from the sixth to the ninth **Gunasthanas**. In these, the **Aharak-Drik** is possible. Therefore, the **Bandha-Yogya** 63 **Prakritis** of the sixth **Gunasthan** are added to the **Aharak-Drik** (63 + 2), making 65 **Prakritis** generally **Bandha-Yogya**. In the seventh, eighth, and ninth **Gunasthanas**, the **Bandha-Swamitva** (ownership of binding) should be understood as 62/56/58/58/56/26. 22/21/20/16/18 respectively.

**5.** In the **Parihar-Vivridhi** (restraint of increase) **Samyama**, the sixth and seventh **Gunasthanas** are present. In these two **Samyamas**, the **Aharak-Drik** does not arise, but it is possible. There are 65 **Prakritis** that are **Vrata-Yogya** (capable of taking vows), and in the **Gunasthanas**, they are respectively 63, 56/58.

**6.** In the **Sukshma-Samparaya** (subtle restraint) **Samyama**, the tenth **Gunasthan** called **Sukshma-Samparaya** is present, and in the **Desha-Virat** (restraint of space) **Samyama**, the eleventh **Gunasthan** called **Desha-Virat** is present. The **Bandha-Swamitva** of both is similar to the general and **Gunasthanas**, with the **Bandha-Yogya** **Prakritis** being in their respective **Gunasthanas**. In other words, there are 17 **Prakritis** **Bandha-Yogya** in **Sukshma-Samparaya** and 67 in **Desha-Virat**.

**A Device for Demonstrating the Bandha-Karma in the Gunasthana**

16. The last four Gunasthana in the 16 Yathajya-Charitra are: Upshama-moha, Kshina-moha, Payogi-kevali, and Ayogi-kevali. Of these four Gunasthana, the Ayogi-kevali Gunasthana does not have any Bandha-karana, so there is no Bandha of any nature. However, in the remaining three Gunasthana, there is Bandha of the seven Vedaniya, both general and specific, according to the Bandha-adhikarya.

17. Upshama-samyak-darshana is found from the fourth to the eleventh Gunasthana. The special characteristic of this Samyak-tva is that there is no Bandha of Aayu. In the fourth Gunasthana, there is no Bandha of Manushya-ayu and Deva-ayu, and in the fifth Gunasthana, there is no Bandha of Deva-ayu. Therefore, out of the 77 Prakruti that are Bandha-yogya in the fourth Gunasthana, the two Aayu are reduced, leaving 75 Prakruti that are Bandha-yogya. Therefore, from the fifth to the seventh Gunasthana, one Prakruti is reduced from the Bandha-samstha mentioned in the Bandha-adhikarya, resulting in Bandha of 66, 62.5, and 58 Prakruti respectively. After this, from the eighth to the eleventh Gunasthana, there is Bandha-svamitva according to the Bandha-adhikarya.

18. In the Vedaka (Sayopamika), the sequence of the Upshama or Kshapaka category begins from the A-purvakarana Gunasthana. Therefore, from the fourth Avirati to the seventh Virata Gunasthana, there are six Gunasthana. In this, Bandha of Aharakatik is possible. Therefore, by adding Aharakatik to the 77 Prakruti that are Bandha-yogya in the fourth Gunasthana, there are 78 Prakruti that are Bandha-yogya in general. And in the other Gunasthana, the Bandha-svamitva is 77, 67, 63, 56, and 58 Prakruti respectively, as mentioned in the Bandha-adhikarya.

19. With the destruction of Darshan-moha, there are eleven Gunasthana from the fourth to the fourteenth in the other Bhashika Samyak-tva. In this, Bandha of Aharakatik is possible, so the Bandha-svamitva is 79 Prakruti in general. And in relation to the Gunasthana, the Bandha-adhikarya is 77, 67, 63, 56, 54, etc., up to one Prakruti in the thirteenth Sthapithakevali Gunasthana.

## Appendix to the Third Karma Granth

**Bondage and Liberation**

The fourteenth, Aayogikevali, Gunasthan is free from bondage because it is not a cause of bondage. The twenty Mithyatva, Samavadan, and Mishradristi are also divisions of the path of Samyaktva. Each of these has one Gunasthan, respectively the first, second, and third.

Since the Tirthankara and Aaharakadvik (Aaharak body, Aaharak limbs) are not capable of being bound, there are 117, 11, and 74 natures capable of being bound in Mithyatva, Samavadan, and Mishradristi respectively.

The 21 Abhavyas have only the first Mithyatva Gunasthan. Due to the attainment of Samyaktva and Paritran, the Tirthankara and Aaharakadvik cannot be bound. Therefore, 117 natures are capable of being bound compared to the general and Gunasthan.

The 22 Asanshi have the first and second Gunasthan. Since the Tirthankara and Aaharakadvik cannot be bound in the general and the first Gunasthan, there are 117 natures capable of being bound, and 101 natures are bound in the second Gunasthan according to the statement of the authority.

In the Aaharak path, all Manovrit Sansari beings are included. From the first Mithyatva to the thirteenth Aayogikevali Gunasthan, there are thirteen Gunasthan. The bondage of these should be understood according to the general and the authority of each Gunasthan. That is, there are 120 natures capable of being bound in general, and 117, 101, 74, 77, 67, etc. should be understood up to Aayogikevali.

The reason why aharakadik is not considered in Krishnadi seen leshyas is that their bandh happens in the seventh gunasthan, and Krishnadi, having three legyah, can reach a maximum of the sixth gunasthan. Therefore, the bandhaswamitva of these leshyas' 118 prakritis is considered common.
In karmagranths, the bandh of 77 prakritis in the sixth gunasthan is mentioned for Krishnadi three leshyas, and this includes devayu of manushyayu. But the siddhant's opinion is that in the sixth gunasthan of Krishnadi seen leshyas,

Third Karma Granth: Appendix

It is said that the bondage (bandh) applies to humans and not to gods. However, it only binds the human soul (manushyayu) and not the divine soul (devayau). Therefore, instead of 77, 76 types of bondage should be considered.

The aforementioned opinion of the सिद्धान्त (Siddhant) is not addressed in the Karma Granth and is simply dismissed as "बहुश्रुतगम्य" (bahushrutgamya). However, it is definitely worthy of consideration and until it is resolved, it must be accepted that the inclusion of the divine soul (devayau) in the bondage of nature (prakritibandh) by the Samyagdrsti who have attained three knowledges (tri-jnana), like Krishna, is an opinion related to the Karma Granth and not just a "संडासिक मल" (sandasik mal).

Third Karma Granth: Parishit
In Padmaleshya, there are 7 Gunasthanas from the beginning, but its general Bandhaswamitva has the characteristic that it does not have the bondage of Trik-Ekendriya, Sthavar, Atap along with the Naraknadak of Tejo leshya, so the general bondage is of 108 Prakritis. And in the first Gunasthan, Tirth Karnam and Aharakdvik, these three Prakritis are not bound, so 105 Prakritis are bondable. Out of them, when the bondage of Mithyatva, Hudra Sansthan, Napusakved, Sewart Sanhanan, these four Prakritis is broken, then there are 101 Prakritis bondable in the second Gunasthan. From the third to the seventh Gunasthan, you should understand it as the same as the Tru Bandhadhikar.

## A Brief Introduction to Jain Karma Literature

There are three main branches of Indian philosophy: (1) Vedic, (2) Buddhist, and (3) Jain. The concept of karma has been discussed in all three branches. While Vedic and Buddhist literature have limited discussions on karma, they lack dedicated texts solely focused on it. However, Jain literature, in contrast, boasts numerous texts dedicated to karma, presenting a systematic, evolutionary, and comprehensive analysis of the subject. Karma literature holds a significant place in Jain scriptures and is known as *Karma Prakriti* or *Karma Anuyoga*.  

Apart from independent texts on karma, various other texts written by *Aacharyas* (Jain teachers) also contain discussions on karma.

The foundation of karma literature lies in Jain scriptures. The compilation of *Karma Shastra* (science of karma) includes ancient texts on karma, which both the Svetambara and Digambara Jain traditions consider to be authentic. These traditions consider *Angrayaniyapurva* (the second of the fourteen *Purvas*) to be part of the twelfth *Anga* (canonical text). Both traditions agree that the twelve *Angas* and fourteen *Purvas* are direct pronouncements of Lord Mahavira. While the current *Karma Shastra* may not be in its original form, it is essentially the essence of Lord Mahavira's teachings, passed down through tradition.

Another belief is that all *Angavidya* (Jain scriptures) are not only from Lord Mahavira's time but also from previous *Tirthankaras* (Jain prophets) and are therefore timeless. However, the flow...

---------------------------
##  The Three Divisions of Karmaśāstra

Though the knowledge of the Angas (canonical texts) of the Tirthankara lineage is considered to be eternal, it has taken on new forms from time to time. Hemchandracharya, in his *Pramana Mimamsa*, states: "The eternal knowledge of the Angas, due to the desire for brevity or expansion, takes on new forms, and is revealed by different authors. The knowledge of the Angas is never lost."

This Karmaśāstra, which has been passed down in the form of *Prayahara* (oral tradition) since time immemorial, can be divided into three parts from the time of Bhagavan Mahavira to the present:

(1) **Pūrvatmaka Karmaśāstra:** This is the largest and oldest part. Its essence is considered to have existed until the time of the *Pūrva-vidya* (ancient knowledge). After Bhagavan Mahavira, the *Pūrva-vidya* existed for about 600 or 1000 years in a gradual form. The eighth *Pūrva* (ancient text) out of the fourteen *Pūrvas* was primarily concerned with Karma. Similarly, there was a section called *Karma-prabha* in the second *Pūrva* of the *Agravaniya* (ancient text). However, the complete portion of the *Pūrvatmaka Karmaśāstra* is not found in the present-day Śvetāmbara and Digambara literature.

(2) **Pūrvohṛta Karmaśāstra:** This division is much smaller than the first, but it is considered quite large from the perspective of present-day practitioners. Therefore, it is also called "Ākara Karmaśāstra." This part is directly quoted from the *Pūrvas* and is considered to be present in the Karmaśāstra of both the Śvetāmbara and Digambara traditions. Due to the division of the traditions during the time of the compilation of the literature, the quoted portions are known by different names. For example, in the Śvetāmbara tradition, they are known as (1) *Krama-prakriti*, (2) *Śataka*, (3) *Patra-sangraha*, (4) *Sapta-tika*, and in the Digambara tradition, they are known as (1) *Mahakarma-prakriti-prabha*, (2) *Kavya-bhūta*. Both traditions consider their respective texts to be *Pūrvohṛta* (quoted from the *Pūrvas*).

(3) **Prākaraṇika Karmaśāstra:** This is the result of the third compilation. It includes numerous large and small chapters related to Karma.

---------------------------
## A Brief Introduction to Karma Literature

This text discusses the study and teaching of Karma literature, particularly the "Prakaran" texts. It emphasizes the importance of studying these texts before delving into the "Aakar" texts.

The "Prakaran" system of Karma Shastra developed and flourished from the 8th-9th to the 16th century CE.

Karma Shastra can be divided into three categories based on compilation:

1. **Prakrit Language:** The earliest Karma Shastra texts were written in Prakrit languages. A significant portion of "Prakaran" Karma Shastra is also written in Prakrit, including commentaries on the original texts.
2. **Sanskrit Language:** As Sanskrit became the dominant language of literature, Jain Acharyas began composing Karma Shastra in Sanskrit. Most commentaries on Karma Shastra were also written in Sanskrit. Some original "Prakaran" texts are also available in Sanskrit.
3. **Vernacular Languages:**  These include Kannada, Gujarati, and Rajasthani Hindi. While some "Prakaran" texts exist in these languages, they are relatively few. These languages were primarily used for translations of original texts and commentaries. Digambara authors favored Kannada and Hindi, while Svetambara authors favored Gujarati.

The total volume of available Karma literature is estimated to be around 700,000 verses. The earliest texts date back to the 2nd century CE.

### Third Kamanthany: Appendix

This section covers the period from the third century to the twentieth century. During this time, the Acharyas elaborated on the Karma Shastra in the form of commentaries, Vrinis, Bhashyas, Vrittis, etc.

Jain Acharyas have extensively discussed the subject of Karma. However, due to the differences in opinion that arose after the death of Bhagwan Mahavira, this discussion became fragmented. The sectarian differences became so rigid that scholars from both sects were unable to come together to discuss the Karma theory as taught by Bhagwan Mahavira. As a result, even though there was no disagreement on the core subject, there were some differences in the technical terms, their interpretations, and sometimes in the underlying meaning. If we consider these differences from a neutral perspective, we can see the truth in them. We can conclude that the Jain Acharyas were fully aware of the importance of preserving the essence of the Karma theory, the fundamental contribution of Jain philosophy. They ensured the preservation of the core principles of Karma literature.

### Some Important Karma Texts

Many of the Karma texts currently available, or those whose existence is known from references in other texts, are unpublished. However, the published texts themselves clearly demonstrate the importance of Jain Karma literature. A look at the list of published texts reveals that commentaries or Sanskrit commentaries on the original texts have been published. Commentaries written in regional languages are still unpublished.

This section provides a brief introduction to some of the published texts that are widely used in study and teaching.

### Karma Prakriti

This text contains 455 verses, compiled based on the second Purva of the Aggraseni Purva Nayaka. In this text, the Acharya has discussed eight aspects of Karma: Bandha (binding), Sankraman (transition), Udhalana (loosening), Apavasana (detachment), Udirana (arousal), Upshaman (suppression), Nidhatti (destruction), and Nikayana (classification).

## A Brief Introduction to Jain Karma Literature

**167**

This text describes the two states of **karmas** (actions): **udaya** (arising) and **satta** (existence). At the beginning, the author pays homage to Lord Mahavira and expresses his intention to describe the eight **karmas**, **udaya**, and **satta** - a total of ten topics.

The author of this text is **Ata Shivasarmasuri**, who is believed to have lived around the 12th century. He was likely a contemporary or predecessor of **Jagmodarak Devadhisha** of the **Kshamasraman** order. He may have also been a member of the **Dashaputraghar** lineage. However, there is limited information available to shed light on these possibilities. Nevertheless, it can be confidently stated that **Shivasarmasuri** was a brilliant and knowledgeable scholar with a deep and profound understanding of **karma**. 

Besides **Karma-prakriti**, he is also credited with the **Praachi Panchama Karmagrantha** (Ancient Fifth Karma Text). Some believe that he also authored the **Saptaatika** (Ancient Seventh Text), while others attribute it to **Chandra Mahत्तर**.

**Explanations of Karma-prakriti**

There are three known commentaries on **Karma-prakriti**. One is in **Prakrit** and is known as the **Purnika**. The author of this commentary is unknown, but it is likely to be the work of the renowned **Churnakar Jinavasaamani Mahत्तर**. Among the Sanskrit commentaries, one is by the famous commentator **Mantrayagiri**, and the other by **Nyayaacharya Yashovijay**. The **Purnika** has approximately 7,000 verses, the **Mantrayagiri** commentary has 8,000 verses, and the **Yashovijay** commentary has 13,000 verses.

**Panchasangraha**

**1**

**1**

The **Panchasangraha** contains approximately 1,000 verses. It discusses topics such as **yoga**, **upayoga**, **gunasthan**, **karmabandha**, **bandhahetu**, **udaya**, **satta**, **bandha**, and the eight **karmas**, among others. The author begins by paying homage to the valiant **Jineshwara**, who destroys the **karmas**, and then expresses his intention to compose a text called **Sangraha**, which is full of profound meaning.

The author then explains the two ways in which the **Panchasangraha** is meaningful...

##  The Third Karma Granth: Appendix

It is written that this text contains a summary of the five texts, Shatakadi, or an introduction to the five doors. 

The names of the doors are as follows:
(1) Yogayog Margna (2) Bandhak (3) Bandhanya (4) Bandhetu and (5) Bandhavidhi.

The author of this text is Acharya Chandra Mahत्तर. The author has mentioned the names of the five doors, Yogayog Margna, etc., but the five texts, Shatakadi, etc., which are the basis of these doors, are not indicated in the original text or the commentary. Acharya Malayagiri has clarified in his commentary on this text that the author has included Shataka, Saptatika, Kshayaprābhṛt Matkarma, and Karmapratiti in these five texts. Out of these five texts, Acharya Malayagiri has mentioned four texts in his commentary as evidence. This proves that, except for Kshayabhūt, the remaining four texts were present during Acharya Malayagiri's time. Even in these four texts, Satkarma is not available today, and the remaining three texts - Shataka, Saptatika, and Karmapratiti - are available at this time.

It is not mentioned that Machch, etc., existed during Mahत्तर's time. In his own commentary, he has only mentioned that he was a disciple of Nepa. Similarly, there is no mention of the term Mahत्तर in his own commentary. It is possible that he was called Mahत्तर based on common usage.

Regarding the time of Acharya Chandra Mahत्तर, it can be said that the terms like Patra, Chandavi, and Rishi Shabdant were particularly prevalent in the 10th century. Therefore, he must have existed in the 10th century Vikram era. Except for Panchasangrah and its commentary, no other work of Chandra Mahत्तर is available.

Panchasangrah is explained by - There are two important commentaries on Panchasangrah.

...Svopaja Vritti and Malayagiri's commentary. Svopaja Vritti is nine thousand verses long and Malayagiri's commentary is eighteen thousand verses long.
Ancient Shat Karma Pramanya - Devendra Suri's Karmagranth is called Malina Karma Pramanya, while their basic old Karmagranth is called Ancient Karma. There are six such ancient Karmagranth and they are the works of different Acharyas like Shivsharm Suri. Their names are as follows:
(1) Karmavipak, (2) Kastab, (3) Randhaswamitva, (4) Parshiti, (5) Shatak, (6) Maptatika.
The author of Karmavipak is Gargaghi. His time is probably the 8th century Vikram. There are three commentaries available for Karmavipak - Garmanand Suri's commentary, Udayaprasamuri's commentary and an anonymous commentary. All three commentaries seem to be from the 12th-13th century Vikram.
The author of Kamrata is Amapt. There are two commentaries and two commentaries on it. One commentary is by Govindacharya and the other is by Abhayaprabhamuri in the form of a commentary. The time of composition of both is probably the 13th century Vikram.
The author of Bandhaswamitva is also unknown. It has a commentary by Haribhadrasuri, which was written in 1112 Vikram Samvat.
Parshipti is the work of Jinavallabhamणि and was written in the 12th century Vikram. There are two anonymous commentaries and many commentaries on it. The commentators include Haribhadrasuri and Malayagiri. Its other name is Agamikayastuvicarsar Prakaran.
The author of Shatak is Shivsharm Suri. There are three commentaries, one commentary and three commentaries on it. There are two short commentaries and the author of the large commentary is Poswarhari. The name of the commentator is unknown. One of the three commentaries is by Mal
Dhari Hemchandra (12th century Vikram), the second by Udayaprabhamuri and ... the third by Gunaratnamuri (15th century Vikram).

Page #228:
---------------------------
## The Third Karma Text: Parishi

It is not certain who authored the Sapttatika. Some consider Chandrashi Mahत्तर to be the author, while others believe it was Shivsharm Suri. There are commentaries on this text by Abhaydev Suri, Ashakartri, Chandrashi Mahत्तर, Malaygiri, Mesthu, Ramdev, and Gunarasna.

The first five of these texts cover the same topics as the five Karma texts by Devendra Suri, but in a more concise form. The Sapttatika (Panchkarma text) discusses the following topics:

* Bandha (bondage)
* Uday (arising)
* Satya (existence)
* Prakriti (nature)
* The future natures of the Jivas who are to be liberated
* The location of Bandha, etc.
* The location of the eight Karmas
* The location of the Moksha (liberation)
* The nature of Bandha
* The types of motion and nature
* The Upshama (cessation) category, the Eka (one) category, and the Kshapaka (destruction) category
* The final fruit of the ascent

The five Karma texts by Acharya Devendra Suri are called the Navya Karma texts. These texts are based on the five ancient Panchkarma texts. The names of these texts are: Karmavipak, Dharmastav, Panyswamitva, Padashiti, and Palak. These texts are known as the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth Karma texts, respectively. The first three names are based on the subject matter, while the last two are based on the structure of the verses.

The author of the five Navya Karma texts is Devendra Suri. These texts are based on the Karma texts written by ancient Acharyas like Shivsharm Suri and Chandrashi Mahत्तर. Devendra Suri not only included the essence of the ancient Karma texts in his own texts, but also preserved the names, topics, and order of presentation. He also added some new topics. The language of these texts is Prakrit, like the ancient Karma texts, and the meter is Arya.

Page #229:
---------------------------
A Brief Introduction to Jain Literature

**The 201 Grand Karma Granthas** - Acharya Devendrasuri wrote commentaries on his Karma Granthas, but for some reason, the commentary on the third Karma Grantha was lost. Later, an Acharya wrote a new commentary in the form of an Avadhuri for this Grantha. Gunaratnasuri and Munishekharsuri wrote commentaries on all five Karma Granthas. In addition to these, Kamal Sanayam Upadhyay, etc., have also written small commentaries on these Karma Granthas. There has been considerable discussion on these in Hindi and Gujarati languages as well.

In the Hindi language, the commentaries of Mahaprash Pandit Sukhlagnji were written about 40 years ago. Now, they are being published again with the commentary of Muni Shri Mishrimalji Maharaj, the founder of Marudhar Kemri, edited by Shri Shri Chanan Surana 'Maras' and Shri Devkumar Jain. The book contains information on the differences between Digambar and Svetambar beliefs, a comparative study of their beliefs, and various mantras and tables.

**Karma Shataka**
This is also called Maha Karma Prakriti Prabhut, Patkhaayam, etc. Its authors are Acharya Pushpadant and Bhootbali. The time of its composition is estimated to be the second or third century of the Vikram era.

This Grantha is 16,000 loka in length. Its language is Prakrit (Shaurseni). Acharya Pushpadant has covered the essence of the subject in 1957 sutras, and Acharya Bhootbali has covered the remaining part in 6000 sutras. The names of the six chapters of Karma Prabhut are as follows:
(1) Jeevasthan, (2) Kshudrak Bandh, (3) Bandhaswamitva Vichay, (4) Vedana, (5) Vargana, (6) Mahabandh.

There are eight Anuyogadwaras and many Ulikas within Jeevasthan. There are eleven Adhikars in Kshudrak Bandh. In Bandhaswamitva Vichay, the binding of Karma Prakritis with Jivas, the presence of Karma Prakritis in Gunasthans, the types of Karma Prakritis like Syoday, Indh, Paroday, Bandh, and Lav, are discussed. There are two Anuyogadwaras called Kriti and Vevama in Vedana. The main Adhikar of Vargana Khand is Anjaniya, which contains a detailed description of Varganas. In addition to this, it also contains...

## Third Religious Text: Appendix

The four rights of **sparsha karma** (touch karma), **prakriti** (nature), and **bandha** (bondage) are also included.

**202**

The **Tees Hajar RTE Prayaan Mahabandha**, a six-part text, extensively describes the four types of **bandha** (bondage): **prakritibandha** (nature bondage), **sthiitibandha** (state bondage), **anubhagbandha** (experience bondage), and **pradeshabandha** (region bondage). **Mahabandha** is also known as **Mahaghavla**.

**Commentaries on the Praabhrut:**

**Veer Senaacharya**'s **Dhavla Tika** is a very important and extensive commentary on **Karma Maasa** (**Shatkhandagam**). The original text contains 72,000 verses and was composed around 605 Vikram Samvat.

In addition to this commentary, **Indanandi**'s **Shrutavatar** mentions the existence of the following commentaries on **Karma Praabhrut**. However, these commentaries are currently unavailable.

**Kundakundaacharya** wrote a commentary called **Pari Karma** on the first three parts of **Karma Praabhrut**. This commentary contained 12,000 verses and was written in Prakrit. The **Dhavla Tika** mentions this text several times.

**Aachaarya Shaamkund** wrote a commentary called **Paddhati** on the first five parts of **Karma Praabhrut**. He also wrote a commentary with the same name on **Kayaabhrut**. Both commentaries contain 12,000 verses and were written in a mixture of Prakrit, Sanskrit, and **Kad** languages.

**Sumbuluuraacharya** wrote a commentary called **Chudamani** on the first five parts of **Karma Praabhrut** and **Kashaya Praabhrut**. This commentary contained 84,000 verses and was written in Kannada. In addition, he wrote a commentary called **Panjika** in Prakrit on the six parts of **Karma Praabhrut**, containing 7,000 verses.

**Samantbhadra Swami** wrote a commentary on the first five parts of **Praabhrut** containing 48,000 verses. Although the **Dhavla** mentions **Samantbhadra**'s commentary, it is currently unavailable.

References have been made to the descent of Shrimaansa etc., but the present commentary is not found in it.
Padev Guru has written commentaries on Karmapraabhrut and Kathaayaabhoot. The commentary written on the five chapters of Karmapraabhrut is called Vyakhyaaprajnapti or. His commentary on the sixth chapter was brief, which was about eight thousand and five verses long. The combined total of the five chapters and the commentary on Kashaymaabhooka was about sixty thousand verses long. The language is Prakrit.
Veersen is the author of the commentary on Karmapaatko. He was a disciple of Aryanandi and a disciple of Chandrasen. His teachings were. The commentary on Karmapraabhrut is also written by Veersen, which is part of the beginning of Jayadhwala.
This is noteworthy for the water scholars.
Rivaayaabhoot
Paapad or Kashayapraabhrut is also called Pejdospaat Potaat or Doshaabhoot.
Just like Karmapraabhrut, the origin of Bhoota is also the Arvaag called Drishtivaad. From the third Praabhrut called Jadosh of the tenth object of the Pawein called Gyaanpravaad in it, Kaayaabhoot is born.
The author of Kashayapraabhrut is Acharya
He has written in the Maatha Sutras.
Gundhar is. Others have been bound. Although there are 233 verses in Prakrit, but in reality there are 100 verses in this book and there are 5 Maayas. Kashayapraabhrutkar Gundharaacharya is not the author, but possibly Acharya Naagahasti, which was added later as a commentary.
According to Jayadhwalaakar in Prakrit, the following 15 Arthaadhikars are:
(1) Praposh (2) Prakritivibhakti, (3) Sthiti (4) Anubhaagvibhakti (5) Pradeshvibhakti- Kshonaashronapradesha- Sthityantika

##  Tṛtīdha Karma: Appendix Section, (6) Bandhaka, (7) Veva, (8) Upayoga, (9) Manu Sthāna, (10) Vyānjana, (11) Samyaktva, (12) Deśa Virati, (13) Saṅgha, (14) Pārivamohaniya's Upśamana, (:::) Gāyili Sāp

At this place, Ayadhavalakāra has also invested that in the same way, from other types, fifteen Arthaadhikāras should be formulated. From this, it appears that in the calculation of the rights of Kṣayaprābhūta, there is no uniformity.

##  Kṣayāmṛta's Commentaries - According to the mention of Indra Nandīkṛta Śrutābhāra, the following commentaries have been written on Kṣayāmṛta...

(1) Ācārya Yativṛṣabha's Niśūtra, (2) Uccāraṇācārya's Uccāraṇāvṛtti or Mūla Uccāraṇa, (3) Ācārya Śāmakunda's Paddhati Tīkā, (4) Sumbulrācārya's Sūḍāmaṇi Vyākhyā, (5) Cappadevaguru's Vyākhyāprāpti Vṛtti, (6) Ācārya Vīrasena Jinaseṇa's Jayadhavla Tīkā. Out of these six commentaries, the first two, namely, Niśūtra and Jayadhavla, are available at present. The Niśūtra by Yativṛṣabha is six thousand loka in size, and the Jayadhavla Tīkā is seven thousand loka in size.

##  Gommatasāra

It has two parts: (1) Jīvakāṇḍa and (2) Karmakāṇḍa. The author is Miccandra Sibāstachakravartī, who lived in the eleventh century of the Vikram era. He was a contemporary of Samuṣṭa Rāya.

The composition of Gommatasāra was done by Cāmuṇḍarāya, whose other name is Gompaṭarāya... according to the question of... as a summary of the Siddhānta texts, hence this text was named Gommatasāra. Its other name is Pañcasammaha, because it describes five topics: Mandha, Badhyamāna, Bandhasvāmi, Mandhahetu, and Bandhabheda.

Gommatasāra has 1705 māthās, out of which 733 are in Jīvakāṇḍa and 972 are in Karmakāṇḍa. In Jīvakāṇḍa, there are five topics: Jīvasthāna, Kṣudrabandha, Bandhasvāmi, Vedanakhaṇḍa, and Vargapaṇḍa, related to the Siddhānta of Mahākarmaprābhūta.

This is a brief introduction to the Jain literature on karma. It discusses the various states of the soul in twenty categories: Gunasthan, Jivasamas, Parit, Language, Sanjha, 16 Marana, and Usage.
The Karmakanda section contains the following nine chapters on karma:
(1) Prakriti Samutkirtana, (2) Bandhodaya Satva, (3) Matvastan Bhang, (4) Vichalika, (5) Sthan Samutkirtana, (6) Pratyay, (7) Bhav Chulika, (8) Nikarana Dhullika, (9) Kasmiti Rachana.
Gommatsar has commentaries... The first commentary on Gommatsar was written by Gommatarayamamulray in the form of a Vritti called Limbi, which was reviewed by Nebhisand Simant Chakravarti. Based on this review, Keshavdi wrote a commentary in Sanskrit. Then Abhay Chandra Siddhanta Chakravarti wrote a Sanskrit commentary called Mandaprabodhini. Based on these two commentaries, Pandit Todarmalji wrote a Hindi commentary called Samyashan Kandhika. Based on these commentaries, the Hindi translation of Jivakanda was done by Pandit Subachandraji and the translation of Karmakanda was done by Pandit Manoharsalji. J. Jaini has done a beautiful English translation of this work.
Bhagtisar (Kshapanasar Gabhit) was written by Nemichandra Siddhanta Chakravarti. Labdhisar discusses the means of liberation from karma. Labdhisar has 646 verses, of which 261 are from Kshapanasar. It has three proofs: (1) Darshanalabdhi, (2) Charitralabdhi, (3) Kshamaikamarit. Among these, the Hayik Parit section is also considered as an independent text in the form of Kshapanasar.
Keshavdi wrote a commentary on Sandhimar in Sanskrit and Pandit Todarmalji wrote a commentary in Hindi. The Sanskrit commentary is only up to the Charim Lamdhi section. The Hindi commentator Todarmalji has explained up to the Parivannavidhi section according to the Sanskrit commentary, but he has explained the Mayik Jarin Prakarpa, i.e., Kshapanasar, according to the Sanskrit prose Kshapanasar written by Madhavchandra.
If one studies the above mentioned texts thoroughly, one can get a clear understanding of the karma literature.

I bow to the victorious Jina. The Karmavivarana (exposition of karma) is summarized. It is done by the soul as the cause, by which it experiences karma. (1)
The four-fold nature of the Mokshadhara (path to liberation) is described. The primary nature and the secondary nature, the difference of a hundred and eight, (2)
Thus, the knowledge-obscuring, faith-obscuring, feeling-obscuring, and life-obscuring (karmas), the name and gotra (lineage) (karmas). The enumeration of the twenty-eight and the four hundred and fifty (karmas). (3)
The pure knowledges - Mati, Sruta, Avadhi, and Kevala - are there. In that, Mati-jnana (sensory knowledge) is fourfold, with the distinction of the four modes of mind. (4)
Aticharya, Ihavaya, Dharana - these six are the activities of the mind. The twenty-two and the fourteen, the twenty, and the six - these are the subtle, the gross, the mixed, and the perfect (stages of the soul). (5)
The seven stages of the Angapravritti (manifestation of the soul's qualities) are thus explained. (6)
The Paryaya (modifications), the Akshara (indestructible), the Prayoga (application), the Pratipatti (realization), the Anuyoga (scriptural exposition), the Pahuda (preliminary), the Palungya (advanced), the Pahudavatthu (subject matter of the preliminary), and the Purvayoga (previous exposition) - all these are summarized.

**The Tiryanchas are like the animals, who are always seeking pleasure.**  They are not like the true victors, who are free from all desires. ||11||

**Without the right knowledge, there is no true happiness.**  Without the right knowledge, there is no true victory. ||12||

**The Jina is the true victor, and he is not like the Tiryanchas.**  He is free from all desires, and he is the one who can help us to achieve liberation. ||13||

**The fourteen types of wrong conduct are the cause of suffering.**  Without the right knowledge, there is no true happiness. ||14||

**The twenty-four types of wrong conduct are the cause of suffering.**  Without the right knowledge, there is no true victory. ||15||

**The Tiryanchas are like the animals, who are always seeking pleasure.**  They are not like the true victors, who are free from all desires. ||16||

**The ten types of greed are the cause of suffering.**  The four types of anger are the cause of suffering.  The two types of delusion are the cause of suffering. ||17||

**The twelve types of wrong thoughts are the cause of suffering.**  The five types of wrong actions are the cause of suffering.  The four types of wrong speech are the cause of suffering. ||18||

The Third Karma Granth's Verses

221

The Supreme Being is present everywhere, but does not bind, due to his invincible qualities. He is the God, and he shows himself, but without the Suras. ||20||

Oh, the eighteen types of food, doubled, have come. From there, the wrong beliefs are in all the Sanas. ||21||

That is the light of Narayana, the Narambar, the pure Sukka. Without the Narabar, see, the wrong food is here. ||22||

All the qualities are present, but the wrong beliefs are not present. The wrong beliefs are not present, and the Karma Bhang is in the wrong food. ||23||

The three types of suffering, the Sukka, the qualities, and the thirteen types of bondage. This is written by the Devinda Sura, for the purpose of Karma. ||24||
