It is with immense joy that we dedicate the fourth Anga, the **Shree Prajnapanasutra**, to the lotus-like hands of our esteemed readers. The **Prajnapanasutra** is a vast Agama, replete with the discussion of **Tattvajnan** (knowledge of principles). It requires extensive elaboration for understanding. Therefore, it is not possible to publish it in a single volume. Hence, only the first volume is being published. The printing of most of the second part is complete, and it is likely to be ready soon. The detailed introduction to this Agama is being written by the renowned scholar **Shree Devendra Muniji M. Shastri**, but due to ill health, he could not complete it. Therefore, that introduction will be included in the final volume and is being printed. The **Prashnavyakaranasutra** has been sent to the press and is being printed. The translation and editing of the **Prajnapanasutra** have been done by **Jainbhushan Punjabkesari Pt. R. Munishree Gyanmuniji Maharaj**. The list of those literary enthusiasts who have borne the burden of the expenses incurred in its editing and translation is being published elsewhere with gratitude. This Agama is being published with the generous financial support of **Shreemaan Dharmapremi Seth S. Sayarchandji Choradaya**, Madras, for which we are grateful. The publication of the **Prajnapanasutra** is taking place on the auspicious occasion of the birth centenary of the first Acharya of the Shraman Sangh, the most revered **Shree Atmaramji Maharaj**. Therefore, keeping in mind the great favors of the late Acharya Samrat, it is being dedicated to his lotus-like hands. A brief introduction to Acharya Shree is also being published. Finally, we consider it our duty to express our heartfelt gratitude to all those great souls who have directly or indirectly contributed or are contributing to the committee.

The Jain philosophers and thinkers who have contemplated on "Pratmasatta" (Self-existence) or have achieved self-realization, have also extensively pondered upon the means and methods of self-development for the benefit of others. Their contemplation and discourse on the soul and its related aspects are known today by various names like Agam, Pitak, Ved, Upanishad, etc. Jain philosophy holds that the afflictions of the soul, such as raga (attachment), dvesha (aversion), etc., can be eliminated through spiritual practices. When these afflictions are completely eradicated, the powers of the soul, such as knowledge, bliss, and energy, are fully manifested. The complete illumination and development of these powers is called "Sarvgyata" (Omniscience). The words, speech, or pronouncements of an omniscient being are known as "Pagam". Agam refers to the scriptures, sutras, or received words that impart knowledge of the principles, self-knowledge, and proper conduct. Generally, the words or speech of an omniscient being are not compiled; they are like scattered flowers. However, specific, highly accomplished omniscient beings who establish the path of Dharma (righteousness) and institute the practice of Dharma in the monastic life are called Arihant or Tirthankara (ford-makers). The benevolent words of the Tirthankara are compiled by their highly learned disciples, the Ganadharas, into the form of "Pagam" or scriptures. In other words, when the free flow of the flowers of the words of the Jinas is bound together in the form of a garland, it takes the form of "Agam". This Pagam, the words of the Jinas, is the primary source of self-knowledge or liberation knowledge for us all. "Agam" was called "Ganipitak" in the ancient language. The entire body of scriptures, in the form of the pronouncements of the Arihants, is contained in the "Dwadashanga" (twelve parts). From the Dwadashanga, the Acharanga, Sutra Kritanga, and other parts and sub-parts have evolved. The study of this Dwadashanga is considered essential and beneficial for every seeker of liberation. The twelfth part of the Dwadashanga is considered a vast and comprehensive repository of scriptural knowledge. Only very special, talented, and learned practitioners could study it. Therefore, the study of the Ekadashanga (eleven parts) was prescribed for seekers, and everyone's focus remained on it. When there was no tradition of writing and the means of writing were very limited, the Agams/scriptures were preserved through memory or by memorizing them through the Guru-parampara (lineage of teachers). Perhaps this is why the knowledge of the Agam was called "Shrutajnana" (knowledge derived from hearing), and meaningful words like "Shruti" (hearing) and "Smriti" (memory) were used. For a thousand years after the Nirvana (liberation) of Lord Mahavira, the knowledge of the Agams was based on the tradition of memory and hearing. Later, due to various reasons such as weakening of memory, the breaking of the Guru-parampara, the effects of calamities, etc., the knowledge of the Agams gradually disappeared. The water of the great lake dried up, leaving only a small puddle. This was a matter of concern for the seeker Shramans.

---------------------------
This was also a challenge to the eagerness and awareness of contemplation. They became eager to protect the treasure trove of Shruta-knowledge / Then the great Shruta-knowledgeable Devaddigni Gani Kshamashraman called a conference of learned Shramanas and appealed to preserve and safeguard the Agam knowledge that was being lost due to memory lapses. By common consent, the Pragrams were written down / This historical work of putting the Jinvani into writing has indeed proved to be an indescribable benefit for the entire knowledge-thirsty population of today. This undertaking to keep the ancient stream of knowledge of culture, philosophy, religion and self-knowledge flowing took place in the ancient city of Valabhi (Saurashtra) under the leadership of Acharya Shri Devaddigni Gani Kshamashraman, 680 or 663 years after the Veer Nirvana / This was the second and final reading of the Jain Agams; but it was the first attempt to write them down / The final form of the Jain Sutras that we have today was given shape in this reading. After being written down, the form of the Agams was indeed preserved in its original form, but due to the passage of time, internal differences of opinion among the Shramanas, weakness of memory, negligence and destruction of vast knowledge repositories due to foreign invasions on the Indian land, etc., the vast wealth of Agam knowledge, the correct Guru-parampara of understanding, gradually began to decline and disappear. Many important words, references and their esoteric meanings of the Pragrams became fragmented / Due to the lack of mature language skills, the Agams that were written by hand were not pure text either, and those who could give the correct meaning of the Agams were rare / Thus, for many reasons, the sacred stream of the Agams became constricted. In the 16th century Vikram era, Veer Lokashah made revolutionary efforts in this direction. A bold undertaking to elucidate the pure and true meaning of the Agams was started again. But after some time, obstacles arose in it too. Communal hatred, theoretical conflict, and the limited knowledge of the scribes became a major obstacle in the attainment of the Agams and their correct understanding / It became difficult for the Agam practitioners to get pure copies / In the first phase of the 19th century, when the tradition of printing the Agams started, the learned readers got some relief. Gradually, through scholarly efforts, the ancient powders, appointments, commentaries, etc. of the Agams came to light and on their basis, the clear and easy understanding of the Agams was published in simple language. This benefited the Pragram-students and knowledge-thirsty people. As a result, the trend of reading and studying the Agams has increased / My experience is that today, the trend of studying the Agams has increased more than ever before, there is a growing attraction and interest in the Agams among the people. This awakening of interest is also influenced by the Agam-Shruta-service of many foreign Agam scholars and Indian non-Jain scholars, which we acknowledge with pride. This process of Agam-editing-publication has been going on systematically for almost a century / Many capable Shramanas, hardworking scholars have contributed to this great Shruta service. Their services, like the bricks of the foundation, may be invisible today, but they are by no means forgettable. In the absence of clear and sufficient resources, we are unable to mention them in more detail, but we are humble and grateful. Nevertheless, we would like to mention the names of some distinguished Pragram Shruta-serving Munivar of the Stanakwasi Jain tradition /

About sixty years ago, Pujya Shri Amolkarishiji Maharaj translated the 32 Jain Agamas from Prakrit into Hindi. He single-handedly completed the translation of all 32 Agamas in just 3 years and 15 days, an incredible feat. His unwavering dedication, courage, and profound knowledge of the Agamas are evident in his work. These 32 Agamas were also published in a short time, making the study of the Agamas much easier and widespread. The Sthanakwasi and Terapanthi communities benefited greatly from this.

When I was studying and practicing the Agamas under the guidance of Gurudev Shri Zoravarmalji Maharaj, some Agamas with commentaries by Acharya Abhaydev and Sheelank, published by the Agamoday Samiti, were available. I used to study and read them. Gurudev Shri had often observed that although this edition was very laborious and useful, and also relatively pure compared to the editions available till then, there were still many unclear passages, and some inaccuracies and differences in the original texts and commentaries. They were difficult for the common people to understand. Since Gurudev Shri himself was a profound scholar of the Agamas, he had gained knowledge of many hidden meanings of the Agamas from his Guru. His intellect was also derived and logical, so he felt this deficiency and wanted a pure, universally useful publication of the Agamas, from which ordinary knowledgeable Shraman-Shramani and inquisitive people could benefit.

This desire of his was expressed many times. But due to some circumstances, his dream-resolution could not be realized, yet it remained an inspiration in my mind. During this period, Acharya Shri Jawaharlalji Maharaj, the first Acharya of the Shraman Sangh, Jain Dharmadiwakar Acharya Shri Atmaramji Maharaj, Vidvadratna Shri Dhaasi Lalji Maharaj, and other wise Munis, made a commendable effort to fill this gap by writing beautiful and detailed commentaries on the Agamas in Hindi, Sanskrit, Gujarati, etc., or by having them written under their supervision.

Shwetamber Murtipujak Amnaya scholar Shraman Parmashrutsevi late Muni Shri Punyavijayji had started a very systematic and high-quality work in the direction of Agam-Sampaadan. Scholars praised it highly. But after his passing, there was an obstruction in it. Nevertheless, under the supervision of Agamjna Muni Shri Jambhuvijayji, etc., the beautiful and high-quality work of Agam-Sampaadan is still going on.

Currently, in the Terapanthi sect, under the leadership of Acharya Shri Tulsi and Yuvacharya Mahapragyaji, the work of Agam-Sampaadan is underway, and scholars are pleased to see the Agamas that have been published. Although there is scope for considerable disagreement in their text decisions, their efforts are significant. Muni Shri Kanhaiyalalji Maharaj "Kamal" is trying to publish the statements of the Agamas by classifying them into Anuyogas. The clarity and originality of his work style are evident in some of the Agamas edited by him.

The venerable scholar of Agam literature, Pt. Shri Bechardasji Doshee, made invaluable contributions in the field of Agam editing. It is with regret that he is no longer amongst us. Eminent thinkers like Shri Dalsukh Bhai Malvaniya are also working towards the modern editing of Agams and guiding many scholars. This is a matter of joy. After observing this entire work style from a bird's eye view, a resolve arose in my mind. Today, the work style of almost all scholars is quite different. Somewhere, only the original text of the Agams is being published, while somewhere, extensive commentaries on the Agams are being written. One is easy to understand, while the other is complex. It is necessary to follow a path so that the common reader can easily obtain knowledge of the Agams. There should be an edition of the Agams that is simple, easy to understand, concise and authentic. My late Gurudev wanted such an Agam edition. Keeping this sentiment in mind, I started discussing this topic 5-6 years ago. After long contemplation, on V.S. 2036, Vaishakh Shukla Dashami, Bhagwan Mahavir's Kaivalya Divas, this firm resolve was declared and the editing and commentary work of the Pagambattisi was also started. In this bold decision, the inspiration/encouragement and guidance of Guru-brother Shasansevi Swami Shri Brajlalji M. has been my main support. Along with this, I have received the devotional support of many Munivar and Sadgrihasths, whose names cannot be mentioned without satisfying my mind. The editor of the Agam Anuyog style, Muni Shri Kanhaiyalalji M. "Kamal", renowned writer Shri Devendramuni M. Shastri, Acharya Shri Atmaramji M.'s disciple Bhandari Shri Padamchandji M. and Pravachanbhushan Shri Amarmuniji, Vidvadratna Shri Gyanmuniji M.; the disciples of the late learned Mahasati Shri Ujjvalkuvarji M., Mahasati Divyaprabhaji, M.A., Ph.D.; Mahasati Muktiprabhaji and learned Mahasati Shri Umravkunvarji M. 'Archana', renowned scholar Shri Dalsukh Bhai Malvaniya, well-known scholar Pt. Shri Shobhachandji Bharill, late Pt. Shri Hiralalji Shastri, Dr. Chaganlalji Shastri and Shri Chandji Surana "Saras" etc. have made this arduous task of Agam editing easier. My mind is overwhelmed with respect and gratitude towards all of them. Along with this, the companionship and cooperation of the service-minded disciples Muni Vinaykumar and Mahendra Muni, the service spirit of Mahasati Shri Kankunvarji, Mahasati Shri Jhankaarkunvarji has always been an inspiration. On this occasion, the memory of the inspiring source, late Shravak Chiman Singhji Lodha, late Shri Pukharajji Sissodia also comes naturally, whose tireless efforts have made the Pragam Samiti so successful in its work. The printing of fifteen Agam texts and the translation and editing of about 15-20 A. 'Mon' in a short period of time is a testament to the deep dedication of all our collaborators. I have strong faith that with the blessings of the supremely revered late Swami Shri Hazarimlalji Maharaj and other Tapasvi souls, and with the goodwill and cooperation of our Shraman Sangh's fortunate leader, Rashtriya Acharya Shri Anandrishiji M. and other Munijans, this planned editing and publication work of Jinvani will be completed soon. With this auspicious wish, —Muni Mishrimal "Madhukar" (Yuvacharya)

[A Brief Glimpse into the Life and Sadhana of Acharya-Samrat Shri Pratmaramji Maharaj] Thousands of beings are born every moment and descend upon this earth, taking on human bodies, but not all their birthdays are celebrated. Nor are all viewed with reverence and respect. Honor is bestowed upon those who live not for themselves, but for society. Those who dedicate all their life-force to the upliftment, construction, and welfare of the lives of people. While they remain aware of their own self-welfare, they also pay full attention to the well-being of others. Acharya-Samrat Pujya Shri Atmaramji Maharaj was one of those great souls whose life was always dedicated to the welfare of others. For 78 years of his life, he kept the lamps of non-violence, restraint, and austerity burning. Wherever the river of his life flowed, an extraordinary radiance spread. Even today, his words and writings serve as a beacon for the lives of people. Birth Acharya-Samrat Pujya Shri Pratmaramji Maharaj was born on Bhadon Sudi Dwadashi, Vikram Samvat 1936, in the home of Seth Mansharamji Chopra, a renowned merchant of Raho, Punjab. His mother's name was Parmeshwari Devi. The parents were overjoyed to have a son as beautiful as gold. A virtuous offspring is obtained only by the merit of past lives. Times of Trouble Acharya Shri's childhood was very troubled. The blows of unbearable karma had greatly troubled him. At the tender age of two, his mother passed away. At the age of eight, his father passed away. He had only his grandmother to care for him during his childhood. After two years, she too passed away. Thus, Acharya Dev's childhood was severely afflicted by the intensity of suffering. Karma is very powerful. Who can escape it? The Path of Restraint and Sadhana The loss of his parents and grandmother made Acharya Dev's mind completely detached from the world. The impermanence of the world began to dance before his eyes. As a result, the great path of self-realization and devotion to the Lord became his experience of true, eternal bliss. Finally, at the tender age of eleven, in Vikram Samvat 1651, he was initiated into the fold of the great Gurudev Pujya Shri Swami Shaligramji Maharaj in Banuud.

Your service to literature, your scriptural study, was vast and profound. You were not unaware of which pearl lay where in the ocean of Jain scriptures, your eyes of knowledge were clear. It was due to your exceptional scholarship that the Jain community bestowed upon you the title of Upadhyaya of the Punjab Sampradaya. You wrote nearly 60 books, translated great scriptures. 'Tattvarth Sutra Jainagma-Samanyava' is your unique creation. Scholars from Germany, France, America and Canada had heartily welcomed this work. You were a learned scholar of Jain, Buddhist and Vedic scriptures. Your service to literature will forever shine like the sun in the literary sky of the Jain world. You were an ocean of tolerance, a sea of courage, fortitude and tolerance. Even in the most dire of crises, no one saw you troubled. Once in Ludhiana, your thigh was broken, it was shattered into three pieces. Dr. Verjan operated on you at the Christian Hospital in Ludhiana. You were not given anesthesia during the operation, yet you remained so calm and composed that Dr. Verjan was astonished. He blurted out, "I used to tell stories of the peace of Jesus, but I am witnessing that peace in the life of this great man." In the twilight of your life, you were afflicted with cancer. Yet you always remained calm. Even when in excruciating pain, your face never showed any sadness or anxiety. When the people of the Ludhiana Jain community brought a doctor and the doctor asked, "Maharaj, what is troubling you?" you gave a beautiful answer. You said, "Doctor Sahib! I am not troubled, those who brought you are surely troubled. Take care of them." Everyone was amazed by Maharajshri's tolerance, saying, "Even with a terrible disease like cancer, Gurudev is completely calm, as if nothing is happening." Principal Position In VS 2003, you were appointed Principal of the Punjab Sthanakwasi Jain Shraman Sangh in Ludhiana, and in VS 2006, you were honored with the position of Principal of the Shri Vardhaman Sthanakwasi Jain Shraman Sangh in Sadri. Truly, your scholarly personality has gained recognition everywhere. Whether Jain or non-Jain, everyone sang the praises of your character and intellectual stature. Even today, people are filled with reverence when they discuss your vast scriptural knowledge. Successful Preacher You were a successful speaker and preacher of your time. Scriptural facts and truth were the foundation of your sermons. From them, the listener received heart-touching, solid principles. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel, Shri Pratap Singh Kairon, Shri Bhimsen Sachar, and other national leaders...

Even great leaders had benefited from your discourses. Truly, there was unparalleled sweetness in your words, such simplicity that even an ordinary literate person could understand them well. Your auspicious teachings are still giving a message of renaissance to the lives of people. / The year 2036 VS is your birth centenary year. / This is a sacred year. It is historic. This year is especially for offering flowers of devotion at the feet of the revered Gurudev. / The greatest achievement of the late Gurudev was the useful edition of Jain Agam literature for scholars and the general public. / This was his heartfelt desire that the true spread of Jain Agam knowledge should happen, that the valuable gems of Agam knowledge should reach the hands of every person. / To give concrete form to this very desire of Gurudev Shri, I have taken the responsibility of translating and interpreting the Prajnapana Sutra. This is my tribute to my revered Gurudev. /  Jnana Muni [17]

The editorial nomenclature 'Pannavana' or 'Prajnapana' is the fourth Upanga of Jain Agam literature. The compiler of this Upanga, Shri Shyamacharya, named it 'Adhyayan', which is its common name. Its specific and prevalent name is 'Prajnapana'. Acharya Shri himself introduced 'Prajnapana' by saying, "Since Bhagwan Mahavira has taught the Prajnapana (Prarupana) of all states, in the same way, I am also going to do (Prajnapana)." Therefore, its special name is Prajnapana. Like 'Uttaraadhyayanasutra', the complete and meaningful name of this Agam can also be 'Prajnapanadhyayan'. The word 'Prajnapana' is based on the actions 'Pannaveti, Paruveti', etc., which are the actual names of the sermons given by Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira. It is known that this Upanga was composed based on those sermons, hence its name is 'Prajnapana'. In addition, in this Upanga and other Angashastras, the words 'Pannse, Pannattm, Pannata' etc. have been used in many places in question-answers, in exaggeration, and in dialogues. While resolving the questions of Aryaskandhak in Bhagavatisutra, Bhagwan Mahavira himself said, "Thus, I have explained in the four worlds, Pannatte." The use of the word 'Prajnapana' for the teachings of Bhagwan Mahavira is clearly evident from all these. 1. Nandi Sutra Anga Bahya Suchi 2, Ajzhayanaminam Chitta-Prajnapana. Ga. 3 3.

---------------------------
The importance and significance of Prajnapana in the entire Jain Pragama literature is the same as that of the fifth Anga Shastra - Bhagavati - Vyakhyaprajnapti in the Upanga Shastras. Rather, in the Bhagavati Sutra, at many places, it is said "Jaha Pannavanaae", referring to the 1st, 2nd, 5th, 6th, 11th, 15th, 17th, 24th, 25th, 26th, and 27th verses of the Prajnapana Sutra to fulfill the subject matter presented. This is the special feature of Prajnapana. In addition, even though Prajnapana is an Upanga, the mention of Bhagavati etc. is rarely found in it. The main reason for this is that the topics discussed in Prajnapana are described in detail in it. From this, the depth and comprehensive principle-formulation of the Prajnapana Sutra is clearly evident.8. In addition, the fifth Anga Shastra Vyakhyaprajnapti is the 'Bhagavati' epithet, similarly, each verse of the present Upanga Shastra is concluded with "Pannavanaae Bhagavaiee", thus the epithet 'Bhagavati' is also used for Prajnapana. This epithet indicates the importance of 'Prajnapana'. It is said that after Bhagwan Mahavira, the 23rd Patt Dhar Bhagwan Aryasyama was proficient in Purva Shruta. He displayed his unique artistry in the creation of Prajnapana, due to which, in Anga and Upanga, the mention of observing 'Prajnapana' is given for special knowledge of those subjects. What is the meaning of 'Prajnapana'? In answer to this, the Shastrakar himself has said11_ 'The formulation regarding the relationship between Jiva and Ajiva is 'Prajnapana'. / According to the famous Vrittikar Acharya Malayagiri of the present Agama, the prefix 'Pra' in the word 'Prajnapana' indicates the special feature of Bhagwan Mahavira's teachings. That is -...12 The subtle analysis of Jiva, Ajiva, etc. elements that the omniscient Bhagwan Mahavira has done, such subtle analysis is not available in the teachings of any other contemporary religious teachers of that era. The basis of Prajnapana Acharya Malayagiri has described this Agama as the Upanga of the Samavayanga Sutra. The reason for this seems to be that the Samavayanga mainly describes the elements of Jiva, Ajiva, etc., and 7. The Great History of Jain Literature Vol. 2 p. 84 8.

The Prajñapana also contains descriptions related to the principles of jiva, ajīva, etc. Therefore, there is no objection to considering it as a part of the Samavāyāṅga. The compiler of the Prajñapana Sūtra, Śrī Śyāmacārya, has described the Prajñapana as the conclusion of the Dṛṣṭivāda. This clearly shows that the Prajñapana contains the essence of the detailed description of the Dṛṣṭivāda. The Dṛṣṭivāda is not available to us today, but it is possible that the Dṛṣṭivāda contained descriptions related to Dṛṣṭidarśana. However, it can be said that the subject matter described in the Prajñapana is consistent with the Jñānapravāda, Ātmapravāda, Karmapravāda, etc. The subject matter of both the Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama and the Prajñapana is almost similar. In the Dhavalāṭīkā of the Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama, the Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama is linked to the Agrayāṇīpurva. Therefore, the Prajñapana can also be associated with the Agrayāṇīpurva. The depth and complexity of the subject matter of the Dṛṣṭivāda and the Purvas is known to the learned scholars of the Jain Agamas. It can be imagined how difficult and complex it is to extract the essence from them or to present a Prajñapana similar to the Prajñapana of all the principles taught by Bhagavān Mahāvīra. From this, the depth and complexity of the subject matter of the Prajñapana Sūtra can be clearly understood. Although Śrī Śyāmacārya has shown great skill in compiling the subject matter of the Prajñapana Sūtra and dividing it into thirty-six chapters, in some places the network of arguments is so complex or the presentation of the subject matter is so intricate that if the reader is even slightly inattentive, he will be led away from the truth of the subject matter and will not be able to grasp the reality. Of the thirty-six chapters of the Prajñapana, many are very extensive, and many are very concise. These thirty-six chapters are, in a way, thirty-six chapters on the subject matter, for which the term "pada" has been used at the end of each chapter. The entire Upāṅgaśāstra has been written in the question-and-answer style. From the beginning to the 81st sūtra, there is no introduction of the questioner and the answerer. After this, the description is given in the form of questions and answers between Gaṇadhara Gautama and Bhagavān Mahāvīra. In some places, there are general questions and answers.

---------------------------
Just as the authoritative accounts of the entire scripture are given in the beginning, in the same way, subject-collecting verses are also presented at the beginning of many chapters. For example, verses are given at the beginning and end of the 3rd, 18th, 20th, and 23rd chapters. Similarly, verses are given at the end of the 18th chapter of the 10th chapter and in the middle of the text, as needed. Excluding the interpolated verses, there are a total of 231 verses, and the rest is prose. / Who is the author of the Sangrahani verses in the Prajnapana Sutra? Nothing can be said about this. / The total number of verses in the presented Pragama is 7887. / In some places, the Sutra text is very long, in some places it is extremely short, full of exaggeration. In some places, the same subject has been repeated. It is mostly a systematic compilation, but in some places, it has also been compiled in reverse order. The subject of all the chapters of the Prajnapana is in accordance with Jain principles. Just as in the Bhagavati Sutra, in the beginning of many initiators or chapters, sometimes the views of others are given, and then their own principles are presented, this is not done in the presented Prajnapana Sutra. In it, almost everywhere, questions and answers related to their own principles are marked in the question-and-answer style. Acharya Shri Malayagiri has connected the topics presented in the Prajnapana with the description of the seven principles of Jiva, Ajiva, etc. in this way: 1-2 Jiva-Ajiva = Chapters 1, 3, 5, 10, and 13, 3 Pasava = Chapters 16 and 22, 4 Bandha = Chapter 23, 5-6-7 Samvara, Nirjara, and Moksha = Chapter 36. Apart from these chapters, in the remaining chapters, the description of some principle is found somewhere. Acharya Malayagiri has included Dravya in the first chapter, Kshetra in the second chapter, Kala in the fourth chapter, and Bhava in the remaining chapters from the Jain perspective. In this text, the topics have not been described by first making characteristics, but by explaining them through divisions and sub-divisions. Therefore, this text is division-based, not characteristic-based. / The Prajnapana-Upanga is a compilation of Arya Shyamacharya; but this does not mean that he himself presented all the things mentioned in it after considering them. His purpose was to collect facts from the Shruta tradition and compile them in a particular way. For example, the divisions of Jiva that are mentioned in the first chapter, were not presented by taking those divisions and making the second place, etc., doors happen, but the thoughts of place, etc., doors, which were present in various forms before the Acharyas, they collected and compiled those thoughts in those doors and chapters. Therefore, this is 18. Pannavanasuttam Bha. 2, Preface p. 10-11 19. Pannavanasuttam (Original Text) Bha. 1 p. 446 20. Prajnapana. Malayavritti, Folio 5 21. Pannavanasuttam Bha. 2 Preface p. 13 [21]

---------------------------
It can be said that the different thoughts that different Acharyas had in different times, and what Shyamacharya received from tradition, he compiled and collected. From this perspective, Prajnapana is a systematic collection of the thought tradition of that time. This is why when the Agamas were written down, Prajnapana Sutra was referred to for a comprehensive discussion of that particular topic. / The two main topics of Jain Agamas are Jiva and Karma. / One discussion is centered on Jiva, and it discusses many topics related to it (such as how many types of Jivas are there, where do they live? What is their lifespan? Where do they go after death? From where and to what गति or योनि do they come? How many senses do they have? How many Vedas do they have? How many types of knowledge do they have? What karmas bind them? etc.). / The other discussion is centered on Karma. For example, how many types of Karma are there? What is their role in the development and decline of different types of Jivas? etc. / The first type of discussion is done in 22 Prajnapana. The present edition has been prepared by the Jain community of Sthanakvasi, who have been aware and have complete faith in the Agamas and Jain principles. From time to time, to explain the intricacies of the Agamas, many Agam scholars of the Sthanakvasi community have translated and discussed them in the language of their time. / During the Tabba era, Acharya Shri Dhansinghji wrote Balavobodh Tabbas on twenty-seven Agamas, which are original and explain the meaning of the words. In the translation era, Acharya Shri Amolkarishiji M. translated thirty-two Agamas into Hindi. / The first Acharya of the Pujya Gurudev Shraman Sangh, Jain Dharmadiwakar Shri Atmaramji Maharaj, translated many Agamas into Hindi and wrote detailed commentaries. After that, Pujya Tho Ghasilalji Maharaj wrote detailed commentaries in Sanskrit along with Hindi-Gujarati translations. Many other places have also published Agam literature. But there was a constant demand for an edition that could satisfy the common people and the people of the present logic-based era, which was neither too detailed nor too concise. Therefore, under the chief editorial guidance of the young Acharya Shri Mishrimalji Maharaj 'Madhukar' of the Bahushat Vidwan Shraman Sangh, and under the supervision of the editorial board consisting of scholars like Pandit Kanhaiyalalji M. 'Kamal', Pandit Devendramuni Ji Shastri, Shri Ratan Muni Ji M., and Pandit Shobhachand Ji Bharill, this new edition of Prajnapana Sutra has been translated and edited. This edition of Prajnapana Sutra has the special feature that it follows the pure original text of 'Pannavanasuttam' published by Shri Mahavira Jain Vidyalaya, Mumbai. This has resulted in the benefit that the Sutra numbers are given in order of thirty-six verses. / In each Sutra, the question is placed in a separate line, the answer in a separate line. And the headings and subheadings of each chapter are given separately, which makes it easier to understand. 22. Pannavanasuttam Bha. 2 Introduction, pp. 20-21 [22]

The reader should find it easy to grasp the subject matter. After presenting the original text of each chapter, its भाववाही (meaningful) translation is given in the order of the सूत्र-संख्या (sutra number). Where there are difficult words or abbreviated words in the original, their simple meaning and full meaning are also given in parentheses, so that the reader does not have to refer back to previous sections. After the word meanings, the discussion of the topics under discussion is given. The discussion is mainly based on the वृत्ति (commentary) written by Acharya Malayagiri. The वृत्ति has not been followed completely. Where the वृत्ति is too extensive, or discusses topics that are irrelevant to the context, it has been omitted. The discussion does not repeat what is clear or already clear in the word meanings. Where the original text is too extensive and repetitive, only its conclusion is given in the discussion. In some places, the original text has been used to try to prove the subject matter discussed in the discussion logically. The references to the subject matter discussed and the quoted evidence in the discussion have been mentioned in the footnotes. In some places, comparative notes have also been given from the तत्त्वार्थसूत्र, जीवाभिगम, भगवती, कर्मग्रन्थ, etc., as well as Buddhist and Vedic texts. By giving the primary meaning at the beginning of each पद (section), a review of all the topics discussed in the पद has been done, so that the reader can understand the heart of the entire पद. To avoid repetition, where words like 'जाव' (where), 'जहा' (where), 'एवं' (and), etc., are used as abbreviations in the previous texts, their explanation has been given mainly in the word meanings. In some places, explanations have been given in the footnotes below the original text. Since प्रज्ञापना is a vast scripture, we have divided it into three volumes. Finally, we plan to give three appendices. One appendix will contain a list of reference texts, the second appendix will contain a list of specific technical terms, and the third will contain a list of specific locations. In this edition, the एण्णवणासुतं भाग 1-2 edited by आगम-प्रभाकर स्व. पुण्यविजयजी म., पं. दलसुखभाई मालवणिया and पं. अमृतलाल मोहनलाल भोजक has been used for determining the original text and primary writing, and the प्रज्ञापनासूत्र मलय. वृत्ति and प्रमेयबोधिनी टीका have been mostly followed for the meaning and discussion. The help of सौजन्यमूर्ति श्री कृष्णचन्द्राचार्यजी (Panchkula) in making this copy available will be remembered. We are grateful to him for this. In addition, help has been taken from many आगमों, Jain-Buddhist texts, थोकड़ों of the पन्नवणासूत्र, etc., and it is our duty to express our gratitude to all of them. Here, we cannot forget to mention the auspicious memory of श्रमणसंघ's first Acharya जैनागमरत्नाकर स्व. गुरुदेव पूज्य श्री प्रात्मारामजी महाराज, who was engaged in the holy work of आगमोद्धार throughout his life, and even in his last moments, his heart was filled with आगम-निष्ठा—'May the श्रमणसंघीय आचार्यश्री and युवाचार्यश्री continue this arduous श्रुतसेवा after me, this is my heartfelt prayer to the merciful शासनदेव.' Under the leadership of श्रमणसंघीय युवाचार्य पंडितरत्न मिश्रीमलजी म. सा., we have taken up the task of editing a difficult and profound आगम like प्रज्ञापना, following the path of आगमोद्धार refined by him. How can I forget my colleagues in this editing work? [23]

I am deeply grateful to the Pragama-tattva-manishi, Pravachana-Prabhakar, Shri Sumermuniji, and the learned Pandit Ratnamunishri Nemichandraji, who have wholeheartedly cooperated in the completion of this Agam work. How can one forget the Pragama-marma-pandit, Pandit Shobhachandraji Bharill, and the editor-extraordinaire, Sahitya-maharathi Shri Shrichandraji Surana, whose Shruta-seva has been invaluable? They have successfully undertaken the responsibility of editing, refining, and printing this Shastra-raj.  Furthermore, I am deeply grateful to my known and unknown collaborators who have encouraged me with their timely and insightful advice. What can I say about my editing? I have strived to edit the 'Yavabuddhibalodayam' Prajnapana to the best of my ability, as well as I could. I do not claim to have unlocked the sacred principles and secrets of the Sarvagna Mahapurushas! There is a limit to the knowledge of someone like me, who is but a small learner. Nevertheless, I am truly satisfied that this edition will surely please the discerning readers and researchers of the Pragamas. - Jnanamuni Jainasthanak Vanud [24]

**Om Namo Vitragaya**

**Shrimant-Shyamarya-Vachka-Virchita Chaturtha Upanga Pannvarana Suttam:**

**Prajnapanasutra Vishaya-Parichay**

Prajnapanasutra is the fourth Upanga and an Angabahya-Shruta of the Jain Agam literature. It contains 36 chapters. Here is a brief introduction to them:

The first chapter of Prajnapanasutra is called "Prajnapanam". It first explains the two types of Prajnapanam, then elaborates on Ajiva-Prajnapanam and then Jiva-Prajnapanam. Ajiva-Prajnapanam explains the different types of Ajiva, both Prarupi Ajiva and Rupi Ajiva. Jiva-Prajnapanam explains the two types of Jivas, Samsari and Siddha, and then elaborates on the 15 types of Siddhas and their differences based on time. It then explains the different types of Samsari Jivas. It classifies all Samsari Jivas from Ekendriya to Panchendriya based on the order of their senses. Here, the regulating principle of the differences in Jivas is the gradual increase in their senses.

The second chapter, "Sthanapad", describes the dwelling places of the following Jivas: Prithvikaaya, Apkaaya, Tejaskaaya, Vayukaaya, Vanaspatikaaya, Dwi-Indriya, Tri-Indriya, Chatur-Indriya, Panchendriya, Nairyaika, Tiryanch, Bhavanvaasi, Vyantar, Jyotishka, Vaimanika, and Siddha. There are two types of dwelling places for Jivas: (1) Svasthan, where a Jiva is born and lives until death, and (2) Prasangika Vasasthan (Uppaat and Samuddaat).

The third chapter, "Alp-Bahutvapad", considers the "alpaness" and "greatness" of Jivas in relation to 27 aspects: direction, motion, sense, body, yoga, Veda, kshaya, leshya, samyaktva, knowledge, vision, restraint, use, food, speaker, abandoned, sufficient, subtle, conscious, existence, Astikaaya, extreme, Jiva, field, bondage, pudgala, and Maha-Dandaka.

The fourth chapter, "Sthitipad", describes the state of the following Jivas: Nairyaika, Bhavanvaasi, Prithvikaaya, Apkaaya, Tejaskaaya, Vayukaaya, Vanaspatikaaya, Dwi-Tri-Chatur-Panchendriya, Manushya, Vyantar, Jyotishka, and Vaimanika.

The fifth chapter, "Visheshpad" or "Paryayapad", discusses the different types of Jivas from Nairyaika to Vaimanika Devas, in the order of the 24 Dandakas. It then discusses the different types of Ajova-Paryaya and the number of Paryayas in relation to the different types of Arupi Ajiva and Rupi Ajiva.

## Introduction

* The sixteenth chapter, *Prayogapad*, discusses fifteen types of *prayoga* (experiments) in relation to the twenty-four *dandakavarti* (bound) beings. Finally, it contemplates the nature of five types of *gatiprapaat* (fall from the state of liberation). 
* The seventeenth chapter, *Leshyapad*, has six *uddeshak* (objectives). The first *uddeshak* discusses the rights of *samakarma*, *samavarna*, *samaleshya*, *samavedana*, *samakriya*, and *samayayu*. The second *uddeshak* describes beings based on the six *leshya* (shades of karma) starting with *krishna* (black). The third *uddeshak* presents questions and answers related to *leshya*. The fourth *uddeshak* discusses the rights of *parinaam* (result), *varna* (color), *ras* (taste), *gandh* (smell), *shuddha* (pure), *aprashasht* (impure), *sanklishta* (complex), *ushna* (hot), *gati* (motion), *parinaam* (result), *pradesh* (region), *avagaadh* (understanding), *vargana* (classification), *sthaan* (place), and *alp-bahutva* (few-many). It also describes the color and taste of *leshya*. The fifth *uddeshak* explains the results of *leshya*, and the sixth *uddeshak* describes how many *leshya* each being has. 
* The eighteenth chapter, *Kayasthitipad*, contemplates how long both beings and non-beings remain in their respective *paryaya* (states). The difference between *sthitipad* and *kayasthitipad* is that *sthitipad* considers the lifespan of the twenty-four *dandakavarti* beings in relation to one *bhava* (existence), while *kayasthitipad* considers the total lifespan of all *bhava* (existences) if a being continues to be reborn in the same *bhava* after death. Additionally, *kayasthitipad* considers the duration (state) of *dharmaastikaya* (body of virtue) and other *kaya* (bodies) in their respective forms. Therefore, it presents thoughts through the doors of beings, motion, senses, yoga, knowledge, etc., up to *astikaya* (body of virtue) and *charam* (final).
* The nineteenth chapter, *Samyaktva-pad*, discusses *samyagdristi* (right faith), *mithyadristi* (wrong faith), and *mishradristi* (mixed faith) in relation to the twenty-four *dandakavarti* beings. 
* The twentieth chapter, *Antakriya-pad*, explains which beings can achieve liberation through *antakriya* (destruction of karma) and why. The term *antakriya* is also used here to mean the end of the current *bhava* (existence) and the attainment of a new *bhava* (existence) (or death). This type of *antakriya* is discussed in relation to the twenty-four *dandakavarti* beings. Only humans can perform *antakriya* in the form of the destruction of karma; this is described through six doors.
* The twenty-first chapter, *Avagaahana-Sansthaan* (or body) *pad*, discusses the types of bodies, their structure, evidence, selection of *pudgala* (particles), the relationship between bodies, their substance, region, substance-regions, and the few-many nature of *avagaahana* (understanding).
* The twenty-second chapter, *Kriya-pad*, discusses all beings in the world in relation to the five actions: *kayiki* (physical), *aadhkarnik* (authority), *praashik* (acquisition), *paritaapanik* (suffering), and *praanaatipaatik* (violence), and their various types.
* The twenty-third chapter, *Karma-prakriti-pad*, has two *uddeshak* (objectives). The first *uddeshak* considers which beings bind how many *karma-prakriti* (types of karma) from the *jnaanavaraaniy* (knowledge-obscuring) and other types of karma. The second *uddeshak* describes the *uttaraprakriti* (results) of karma and their binding.

Does it consume all *pudgalas*? How does it transform? What are *lomāhāra* (hair-like food) and other types of food?
    * **Second Objective:**  This section discusses thirteen aspects of *āhāra*: *bhāvyā*, *saṁjñī*, *leśyā*, *dṛṣṭi*, etc.

## The Pannavanasutta: A Summary

This is the first chapter of the Prajnapanasutra, known as the Pannavanapad. It primarily focuses on the Jain understanding of the concepts of *Jiva* (living beings) and *Ajiv* (non-living beings). 

The text begins by explaining the *Ajiv* before the *Jiva* because the description of the *Ajiv* is shorter. It categorizes *Ajiv* into two types: *Rupi* (material) and *Arupi* (immaterial). *Rupi* includes the *Pudgala* (matter) while *Arupi* includes the three *Dravyas* (substances): *Dharma*, *Adharma*, and *Akasha*.  

The text further elaborates on the *Arupi* *Ajiv* by dividing *Dharma*, *Adharma*, and *Akasha* into *Desha* (space) and *Pradesha* (region). It then describes the *Rupi* *Ajiv* by outlining its four main categories: *Skandha*, *Ayatan*, *Indriya*, and *Paramanu* (atom). It also explains how these categories can be further divided into various forms based on their *varna* (color), *gandha* (smell), *rasa* (taste), *sparsha* (touch), and *sansthana* (structure). 

The text mentions that there are 530 possible combinations of these characteristics, but emphasizes that there are actually infinite variations. The author then states that a more detailed description of the *Ajiv* and its synonyms can be found in the fifth chapter of this text, while the thirteenth chapter discusses its transformations.

The text then moves on to the *Jiva*, outlining its two main categories: *Siddha* (liberated souls) and *Sansari* (bound souls). It further categorizes *Siddha* into 15 types and explains how they differ based on their time of liberation. The text also refutes the idea that liberated souls merge into a supreme being, instead emphasizing the individual existence of each liberated soul.

The text then describes the various types of *Sansari* souls, from those with one sense organ to those with five. It emphasizes that each soul is independent and not a part of God. The text argues that if souls were part of a universal consciousness, then concepts like individual karma, its consequences, and liberation from it would be impossible. 

The text concludes by describing the different types of *Sansari* souls, from those in the earth realm to those in the heavenly realms. It also mentions that these souls are constantly cycling through the four realms of existence and the 84 lakh *yoni* (species) or 24 *dandaka* (stages of existence).

Page #41:
---------------------------
The Prajnapana Sutra states that as long as there is wandering and coming and going, liberation from the cycle of birth and death cannot be attained. Liberation cannot be achieved by any deity, god, or avatar (God), but only through one's own practice of the Three Jewels (Ratnatraya). By explaining the distinctions between knowledge, vision, and conduct, it clarifies that attaining the state of Upashantakashaya, Kshina-kashaya, Saksham-samparaya, Vitraga, and Kevalitva, etc., is within the power of the human being. Through their own efforts, they can achieve the highest level of Aryatva and Siddhatva. While the Prajnapana of Narakas and Devas is discussed in detail elsewhere, the Prajnapana of humans is not as extensively covered. Therefore, the first chapter presents a detailed description of humans, which is useful in clarifying the principles of Jain philosophy.

**Salutation and Four Anubandha Related to the Text**

[Salutations to the Arihantas / Salutations to the Siddhas. Salutations to the Pracharayas / Salutations to the Upadhyayas. Salutations to all the virtuous ones in the world. //] 1. Saluting the Siddhas, free from old age, death, and fear, in three ways / I bow to the Trilokya Guru, the Jina, the Lord Mahavira. // 1 //  The Jina, the Lord, who destroys the darkness of ignorance, with the knowledge of the three jewels, / has taught the nature of all things, the Prajnapana, to the Bhavyas. // 2 //  Just as the Bhagavan has described this Prajnapana, a collection of various Shruta-ratnas, like the essence of the vision of the truth, / I (Shyamarya) will also describe it in the same way. // 3 //

**Explanation**

The salutation and four Anubandha related to the text - This sutra presents the salutation and four Anubandha related to the text in three verses, at the beginning of the Prajnapana Sutra by the author, Shyamarya. The purpose of the salutation is to remove obstacles and ensure a smooth study of the text.

**The Importance of the Salutation**

This Upanga is a text that teaches about all living beings, non-living things, and other substances. Therefore, at the beginning of the text, the reader should perform three salutations to encourage them to study the text and to remove obstacles. It is the practice of the virtuous to perform the following three salutations: the first salutation to ensure a smooth study of the text, the second salutation to stabilize the subject matter being studied, and the third salutation to connect the text with the lineage of teachers.

---------------------------
[10] To keep the Prajñāpanā Sūtra constantly active, the final Mangalāchāra should be performed. Accordingly, the author of the text has presented the Ādi-mangal with three gāthās, beginning with "Vavgayajaramarana Bhae0", the Madhyamangal with the gnostic sūtra-pāṭha beginning with "Kaivihe Gan Uvproge Panatte?", and the Antamangal with the sūtra-pāṭha beginning with "Suhi Suhan Patta", which is based on the authority of the Siddhas.

The fourfold anubandha of the text should be explained at the beginning of the Anubandha Chatuṣṭaya-śāstra, in order to engage all the noble and intelligent in the study of the text. These four anubandhas are: (1) Subject, (2) Authority, (3) Relationship, and (4) Purpose. The three gāthās of the Mangalāchāra itself convey these four anubandhas of the present text.

The subject of the text is the presentation of the Prajñāpanā of all beings in the form of the Śruta-nidhi. The word "Prajñāpanā" itself clearly indicates that it is "that by which the Jīva, Ajīva, and other principles are made known in an excellent way". Here, "in an excellent way" means to present the true nature of things as they are, in a way that is not possible for those who are unable to present the true nature of things, such as the promoters of all false doctrines. To make known means to implant it in the mind of the disciple.

The authority of this text is one who has faith in the words of the omniscient, who has an interest in the knowledge of the scriptures, and who experiences an unprecedented joy through the knowledge of the scriptures and the knowledge of the principles. Such an authority may be a Mahāvratī, an Aṇuvratī, or one who is endowed with Samyagdṛṣṭi. As it is said, "He who is impartial, intelligent, and seeker of the knowledge of the principles, is a worthy listener (speaker)."

The relationship in this text is of two types: (1) Upayopeyabhāva-sambandha and (2) Guruparvakramārūpa-sambandha. The first relationship is from the perspective of those who follow logic. The subject matter obtained through words is the Upaya, and its knowledge is the Upeya. The Guruparvakramārūpa-sambandha is only 1.

**Mangalacharan** [11 is expected from the devotees according to their faith, which will be explained by the scholars themselves. **Purpose** - The purpose of this scripture is of two types - **Para** (ultimate) purpose and **Apara** (conventional) purpose / These two purposes are also of two types - (1) **Para-Apara** purpose of the author and (2) **Para-Apara** purpose of the listener / **Author's purpose** - Considering from the perspective of **Dravyastikaya** (substance-based) **naya**, since **Agam** is eternal, it has no author. As it is said, "This **Dwadashangi** was never, is not, will never be, and will never be. It is **dhruva**, eternal and everlasting, etc. / Considering from the perspective of **Paryayathika** (relational) **naya**, **Agam** is impermanent, therefore it must have an author / In reality, considering from the perspective of **Tattvika** (real) **naya**, **Agam** is **sutra**, meaning and both. / Therefore, being eternal in terms of meaning and impermanent in terms of **sutra**, the author of the scripture is somehow proven / The author's **Para** purpose from this scripture is to grace the beings and the **Apara** purpose is to attain **moksha** / It is also said, "The person who graces the suffering beings with the teachings of the **Sarvajña** (omniscient), attains **moksha** quickly." Someone might say that the **Arhat** (Tirthankara) who is the propagator of the **Agam** in the form of meaning has already achieved his purpose, what is the purpose of him propagating the scripture? Propagating the **Agam** in the form of meaning without any purpose is futile. The solution to this doubt is that it is not so / The **Tirthankara** propagates the **Arthagam** due to the **vipako-day** (fruition) of the **Tirthankara-namakarma**. In **Aavashyak-niyukti**, this topic is illuminated by a question-answer - (Q) "How is that (**Tirthankara-namakarma**) experienced (enjoyed)?" (A) "By giving **dharma-deshana** (religious discourse) from **Aglan-mav** (state of non-attachment)." **Listener's purpose** - The listener's **Para** purpose is to know the meaning of the desired study / That is, the listener gets to know the desired meaning of the **Agam** as soon as he hears it. The **Apara** purpose is to attain **moksha** / When the listener knows the meaning of the desired study appropriately, and internalizes it, he becomes detached from the world / Being detached, he makes the right effort in the path of **samyama** (self-control) to get rid of the cycle of birth and death / Due to the intense effort in **samyama** and detachment from the world, the listener's all **karmas** (actions) are destroyed, making the attainment of **moksha** possible. It is also said - "The people who are detached from the world (**moksha-anusari**) due to the true knowledge of the nature of things, engage in action and attain the ultimate goal (**moksha**) without any obstacles." **Explanation of some specific words** - "**Vak-gay-jara-maran-bhae**" = Those who are forever free from old age, death and fear. This is the description of the **siddhas** / The meaning of **jara** is the state of bondage in the form of loss of youth, the meaning of **maran** is the death of the body, and the meaning of **bhae** is the seven types of fear - fear of this world, fear of the next world, etc. / The **siddha** **bhagavans** are completely free from these. **Siddha** - those who have attained the eightfold path of **sit** (bound) **Agam** - **Aav.

[12] Those who have burned (ashes) the karma-fuel with the blazing fire of pure meditation, they are Siddhas. Or those who have become Siddha-confirmed (fulfilled), they are Siddhas. Or, since the root "sidh" is in the sense of "shasta" (teacher) and auspiciousness, two more meanings emerge from it (1) those who have become teachers, or (2) those who have experienced auspiciousness, they are Siddhas. Jinari-those who conquer the enemies like raga, etc., they are Jins / They are of four types - Shrutajin, Avadhijin, Manahparyayajin and Kevalijin / Here, the word "var" is used to indicate Kevalijin. Among the Jins, the one who is the best (var) and possesses Kevalajnan, the knowledge of the nature of all things in the past, future and present, is called Jinavar. But such a Jinavar is also a common Kevali, therefore, to indicate the position of Tirthankar, the epithet "Indra" has been added to Jinavar, which means "Indra of Jinavars". Here, instead of bowing to other Tirthankaras like Rishabhdev, only Tirthankar Mahavira has been bowed to, the reason for this is that Mahavira is the lord of the present Jinashasana (Dharmatirth) and is therefore a happy benefactor / Mahavira - the one who is a great hero, he is Mahavira. In the spiritual realm, the meaning of hero is one who shows heroism = valor against enemies like kshaya, etc. The name "Mahavira" of Mahavira has been given by the gods and demons in view of the extraordinary heroism shown by Mahavira in conquering the parisahas and upsargas. Telokkaguru - this is the epithet of Bhagwan Mahavira - the Guru of the three worlds. Guru is one who truly expounds the meaning of the sermon. Bhagwan Mahavira was the Guru of the three worlds because he preached Dharma to the Asurakumaras, etc., who lived in the lower world, to the humans, animals, Vidyadharas, Vanavyantar and Jyotishkadevas who lived in the middle world, and to the Saudharma, etc., Vaimanik Devas, Indras, etc., who lived in the upper world. The three words "Jinavarendra", "Mahavira" and "Trailokya Guru" used for Bhagwan Mahavira, respectively, reveal his knowledge, worship, liberation from hell and speech. / Jinavarenam Bhagavaya - even a common Kevali is called Jin, but by adding the word "var" to it, even a common Kevali can be indicated as a better - superior Tirthankar, but compared to a chhadmastha-kshinamohajina, even a common Kevali can be called "Jinavar", therefore, the epithet "Bhagavaya" has been added to indicate the meaning of Tirthankar. Bhagwan Mahavira had all the eight great powers (Ashta Mahapratihariya), lordship over the three worlds (Trailokyaadhipatitva), Dharma, fame, wealth, dispassion and effort, these six Bhagavattattvas, therefore, here "Tirthankar Bhagwan Mahavira" clearly indicates this meaning. Sitam - bound eight types of karma-fuel, matam - burned by the blazing fire of pure meditation, those are Siddhas. Or, if "sidh samraddhau" - they become Siddhas, they become fulfilled; or, if "sidh shastra mangalye cha" - they become teachers, they experience auspiciousness, they are Siddhas / / "Dhaatam sitam yena puranakarma, yo va gato nirvritisoudhamuni / Khyato'nushasta parinishthitartho, yah so'stu siddha krtamangalo me // - Prajnapanam.

[Mangalacharan] [13 Bhavyajanainvaikarenam - This has two meanings. Due to the anaadi parinaamik bhaav, the one who is capable of attaining Siddhi is called Bhavy. Such Bhavyas are those who are given the ratnatraya of Samyagdarshan, etc., which are the causes of nirvriti-nirvaan, shanti or nirvaan. One meaning of nirvaan is the attainment of one's own true nature by the removal of all karma-mal. The question is, do Bhagavan only give the ratnatraya of Samyagdarshan, etc., which are the causes of such nirvaan, to Bhavyas? This seems like a kind of partiality towards Bhavyas. The solution is that the sun gives light to everyone equally, but only those with eyes who are capable of seeing can benefit from it. The light of the sun is not beneficial to tamasic birds (like owls, etc.). Similarly, Bhagavan gives teachings to all beings equally, but the nature of Abhavyas is such that they cannot benefit from Bhagavan's teachings. Uvadansiya - Just as listeners quickly understand the truth of reality from close proximity, Bhagavan has made this (prajnaapana) audible to listeners through clear discourses. Pannavana = Prajnaapana - The words that are used to describe the nature of jiva, etc. The names of the 36 chapters of Prajnaapana Sutra are: 2.

Thus, the description of non-living-Prajnapana is also complete.  

**Discussion-Prajnapana:** Two types and two types of non-living-Prajnapana are presented in eleven sutras (Sutras 3 to 13). The two main types of living-non-living related to Prajnapana, followed by two types of non-living-Prajnapana, formless and form, and their various alternatives (breaks) are presented. 

**First Prajnapana Pada:** Who is the questioner, who is the answerer? The author of the Prajnapana Sutra is Shri Shyamaraya (Shyamacharya). He has initially raised questions in general from an unattached, intermediary, intelligent and seeker of truth listener or inquirer, and further in many places or verses, Shri Gautam Ganadhar has raised questions, and the answers have been presented by Bhagwan Mahavira. Although there is no direct Gautam Ganadhar or any intermediary questioner and answerer like Bhagwan Mahavira here, but 'Prattham Bhasai Araha, Suttam Ganthanthi Ganahara Niunam' (The Arhant speaks the meaning of the scriptures and the Ganadhar skillfully compiles it in the form of sutras /) by this principle, the traditional meaning of the scriptures is derived from Tirthankara Bhagwan Mahavira and Gautam etc. Ganadharas, therefore, and all the scriptural knowledge is of the Tirthankaras and Ganadharas, I am only the compiler, thus, to show my humility, it is appropriate to present the truths taught by Tirthankara Bhagwan in the form of questions and answers / This scripture has been quoted from where? By whom is the meaning presented in it? This has been clearly stated in the second and third Mangalacharan Gatha. 

**The typological nature of Prajnapana:** What is Prajnapana? This question or the fruit of such scriptural style questions is what is the typological nature of Prajnapana or other intended elements? The meaning or nature of Prajnapana according to etymology has already been presented. In fact, to establish all the substances or elements related to living and non-living in the mind of the disciple or seeker of truth is the meaning or nature of Prajnapana. 

**Living-Prajnapana and Non-living-Prajnapana:** All sentient and useful beings are called living beings, those who do not have consciousness, do not have use, they are all called non-living. In the Prajnapana of living beings, by classifying living beings in terms of senses and various movements and yonis, their 1. (a) 'Madhyastho Buddhimanon, Shrota Patramiti Smrutaha.'

---------------------------
[28] The *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* presents various classifications of *bheda-pra-bheda* (differences and sub-differences). The *Ajīva-prajñāpanā* classifies the *arūpī* (formless) and *rūpī* (formful) *ajīvas* and presents the various *vikalpa* (changes) that arise from the interaction of different colors, smells, tastes, touches, and substances.  Ultimately, the entire *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* analyzes the various elements or substances that arise from the *jīva* (living being) and *ajīva* (non-living being). The *Jīva-prajñāpanā* and *Ajīva-prajñāpanā* are the two fundamental foundations of all the teachings of this scripture.

The definition of *rūpī ajīva* is: those that have form are called *rūpī*. Here, the inclusion of form implies the inclusion of taste, smell, touch, and substance by implication, because the existence of form alone without taste, smell, etc. is not possible. Every atom has form, taste, smell, and touch. Consider only the atom, it is only a cause, not an effect, and it is eternal in its substance form and impermanent in its modification form. It has one taste, one smell, one color, and two touches. It is not known through direct perception, but only inferred from its function as a *skandha*. Alternatively, the meaning of form is: touch, form, etc. are the objects of the mind, those in which they exist are called *manik* or *rūpī*. All the objects in the world that have form, etc. are included in the *rūpī ajīva*.

The definition of *prārūpī ajīva* is: those that do not have color, smell, taste, touch, etc. are called *prārūpī ajīva*. Since there are ten main categories of *arūpī ajīva*, its *prajñāpanā* is also said to be of ten types. The *skandha*, *deśa* (region), and *pradeśa* (sub-region) of *dharma-āstikāya*, *adharma-āstikāya*, and *ākāśa-āstikāya*, totaling ten categories.

The definition of *dharma-āstikāya* etc. is: *dharma-āstikāya* is the causal factor that facilitates the movement of *jīvas* and *pudgalas* in their self-motion transformation, it sustains the nature of the movement of *jīvas* and *pudgalas*. The meaning of *asti* here is *pradeśa* (region), the *kāya* (body) of those (astis) is the *āstikāya* (aggregate of regions). The *āstikāya* in the form of *dharma* is called *dharma-āstikāya*. The term *dharma-āstikāya* refers to the substance that is composed of countless regions of *dharma-āstikāya*. The *avayavī* (composed of parts) has a special form of *tathārūpa-saṁghāta-pariṇāma* (transformation of the aggregate of the same form), but there is no separate substance with a different meaning from the parts. The *deśa* (region) of *dharma-āstikāya* is the two, three, etc. regional divisions of the same *dharma-āstikāya* conceived by the mind. The *pradeśa* (sub-region) of *dharma-āstikāya* is the most refined *deśa* (region) conceived by the mind, a sub-division that cannot be further divided. *Adharma-āstikāya* is the opposite of *dharma-āstikāya*. That is, the abstract, countless-region-aggregate substance that helps in the state of *jīvas* and *pudgalas* in their state transformation is *adharma-āstikāya*. The *deśa* (region) and *pradeśa* (sub-region) of *adharma-āstikāya* are the two-region, etc. divisions of *adharma-āstikāya* conceived by the mind, and its most subtle division, which cannot be further divided, is the *adharma-āstikāya-pradeśa*. The *pradeśas* of *dharma-āstikāya* and *adharma-āstikāya* are countless, equal to the *pradeśas* of the *loka-ākāśa* (world space).

[29 First Proclamation Chapter]  **Ākāśastikāya** - That which is space, is where the substances (pa = limit) are manifested in their luminous form without abandoning their own nature (pra); or that which is luminous and pervades all substances, is space. The meaning of Astikāya is the aggregate of regions. Ākāśarūpa Astikāya is called Ākāśastikāya. The meaning of the country and region of Ākāśastikāya is as before.  Although Lokākāśa is of innumerable regions, Alokaākāśa is infinite. From this perspective, the regions of Ākāśastikāya are infinite.  **Praddhāsamaya** - They say - time is **addhā** / Time in the form of addhā is Praddhāsamaya. Or the time of addhā (time) i.e. the indivisible part (portion) is called 'Praddhāsamaya'. From the ultimate perspective, there is only one time 'sat' in the present; there is no time in the past and future; because the times of the past have been destroyed and the times of the future have not yet been born / Therefore, the concept of an aggregate of countries and regions in time cannot be conceived. The concept of Pravālikā etc. in the form of an aggregate of innumerable times is only for practical purposes.  **Explanation of Skandha etc.** According to the etymology of Skandha, the meaning of Skandha is - that which is a pudgala that is strengthened (increased) by the meeting of other pudgalas, and that which is diminished (decreased) by disintegration, removal or separation, is Skandha / The use of the plural in the word 'Skandha' is to indicate the infinity of pudgala-skandhas, because Skandhas are said to be infinite in the Praagamas / **Skandhadesa** - The intellectually conceived divisions (from two regions to infinite regions) of Skandhas that do not abandon the Skandharūpa parināma are called Skandhadesa. Here too, the use of the plural for Skandhadesa and in the infinite-infinite-region Skandhas, there can also be infinite Skandhadesa, this is to indicate that / **Skandha-pradesa** - The intellectually conceived excellent country of Skandhas, i.e. the indivisible part (atom) that has merged into Skandha, is called Skandhapradesa / **Paramanu** - Pudgala-nivibhāgadravya (such pudgaladravya which cannot be divided) is called the ultimate atom, Paramanu-pudgala. Paramanu are not merged into Skandha, they are independent pudgalas. 'The four Skandhas, country, region and paramanu-pudgala, which are the four forms of the non-living, are said to be five types each in brief / For example, those that are transformed into the form of colour are called Varṇaparṇata. Similarly, one should understand Gandhaparṇata, Rasaparṇata, Sparśaparṇata and Sansthāṇaparṇata / The word 'parṇata' is indicative of the past tense, but it is also true of the present and future by implication, because the past is not possible without the present and future. That which crosses the present becomes the past, and that which experiences the present is also the future, that which has attained the present is perceived, and that which will attain the present is the future / From this perspective, the meaning of Varṇaparṇata is - that which has been transformed into the form of colour, is being transformed, and will be transformed. Similarly, one should understand the trikālasūcak meaning of Gandhaparṇata etc. The distinction of Varṇaparṇata etc. pudgalas and their explanation - 5 types of Varṇaparṇata - those pudgalas that are transformed into the form of colour are of 5 types - (1) some are black like kajal etc., they are 1.

**Prajñāpanasūtra**

**Color Transformation:**

(1) Some pudgalas are transformed into black color, like the color of Krishna, they are **Kṛṣṇavarṇapariṇata**. (2) Some are transformed into blue color, like the color of indigo or a peacock's neck, they are **nīlavarṇapariṇata**. (3) Some are transformed into red color, like the color of red lead, they are **lohitavarṇapariṇata**. (4) Some are transformed into yellow color, like the color of turmeric, they are **hāridravarṇapariṇata**. (5) Some pudgalas are transformed into white color, like the color of a conch shell, they are **śuklavarṇapariṇata**.

**Smell Transformation:**

There are two types of **gandhaparināta** (smell transformation): (1) Some pudgalas become fragrant due to the presence of sandalwood or other similar materials, they are **sugandhaparināta**. (2) Some become foul-smelling due to the presence of garlic or other similar materials, they are **durgandhaparināta**.

**Taste Transformation:**

There are five types of **rasapariṇata** (taste transformation): (1) Some pudgalas have a bitter taste, like the taste of chili peppers, they are **tikta**. (2) Some have a pungent taste, like the taste of neem or chirata, they are **katu**. (3) Some have an astringent taste, like the taste of harad, they are **kaṣāya**. (4) Some have a sour taste, like the taste of tamarind, they are **amla**. (5) Some have a sweet taste, like the taste of sugar, they are **madhura**.

**Touch Transformation:**

There are eight types of **sparśapariṇata** (touch transformation): (1) Some pudgalas have a hard touch, like the touch of a stone, they are **kathora**. (2) Some have a soft touch, like the touch of cotton or silk, they are **komala**. (3) Some have a heavy touch, like the touch of a diamond or iron, they are **guru**. (4) Some have a light touch, like the touch of silk cotton, they are **laghu**. (5) Some have a cold touch, like the touch of a lotus or a banana tree, they are **śīta**. (6) Some have a hot touch, like the touch of fire, they are **uṣṇa**. (7) Some have a smooth touch, like the touch of ghee, they are **snigdha**. (8) Some have a rough touch, like the touch of ash, they are **rūkṣa**.

**Shape Transformation:**

There are five types of **sanstḥānapariṇata** (shape transformation): (1) Some pudgalas have a circular shape, like a ring or a bangle, they are **parimaṇḍalasansthāna**. (2) Some have a round shape, like a potter's wheel or a plate, they are **vṛtta**. (3) Some have a triangular shape, like a water chestnut, they are **vyasra**. (4) Some have a square shape, like a pitcher, they are **caturāsrasansthāna**. (5) Some have a rectangular shape, like a stick, they are **āyat**.

**Interrelation of Color, Smell, Taste, Touch, and Shape:**

The interrelation of color, smell, taste, touch, and shape gives rise to **bhaṅgajāla** (combinations). The text now describes the combinations that arise from the interrelation of these five qualities with the four types of **skandha** (aggregates).

**Explanation:**

When a pudgala is transformed into one of the five colors, and also into one of the two smells, five tastes, eight touches, and five shapes, then there are 100 combinations (20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 100).

When a pudgala is transformed into one of the two smells, and also into one of the five colors, five tastes, eight touches, and five shapes, then there are 46 combinations (23 + 23 = 46).

---------------------------
[First Knowledge-Declaration Chapter] [31. (3) Pudgala, transformed as each of the five tastes, if transformed by five colors, two smells, one touch and five institutions, then 20+20+20+20+20 - 100 of those five are destroyed. (4) Pudgala, transformed as each of the eight touches, if transformed by five colors, two smells, five tastes, six touches (excluding the opposite and self-touch) and five institutions, then 23+23+23+23+23+23 = 184 of them are destroyed.  /  (5) Pudgala, transformed as each of the five institutions, if transformed by five colors, two smells, five tastes and eight touches, then 20+20+20+20+20 = 100 of them are destroyed.  /  Thus, in terms of the mutual relationship of the five, including color, a total of 100+46+100+184+100 = 530 destructions (alternatives) are produced. To understand this clearly, take an example - suppose some skandha-shaped pudgala are black in color, that is, transformed as krishnavarna, some of them are fragrant in terms of smell, some are also foul-smelling.  /  In terms of taste - they can also be bitter, pungent, astringent, sour and sweet.  /  Think of touch from the point of view of sight, then they can be any one of the eight touches, including harsh, etc.  /  If considered in terms of institution, then those krishnavarna-transformed pudgala are also parimandala, circle, triangle, quadrilateral and rectangular in shape.  /  Thus, with a krishnavarna pudgala, 20 destructions occur with respect to each smell, taste, touch and institution. Similarly, all the aforementioned destructions should be considered. The number of alternatives should be understood from the point of view of the place, not from the microscopic point of view - although five colors, two smells, five tastes are found in the badaraskandhas, therefore, destructions (alternatives) can also occur from the remaining colors, etc., except for the authorized color, etc., however, in those badaraskandhas which are only practically black, etc., in the middle skandhas, such as - there is only one netraskandha in the dehas kandha, within it there is a red one, another within it is white, only those are intended here. Other colors, etc., are not possible in them. In the representation of touch, other touches are also seen along with one touch, excluding the opposite touch. Therefore, the number of destructions mentioned here is justified. But this number of alternatives should be understood only from the point of view of the place.  /  If seen microscopically, there can be infinite alternatives due to the infinite infinite differences of each of these in terms of tartamta. The duration of the color, etc., transformations is from the lowest one time to the highest innumerable time. 'Jiva-Prajnapan: Swaroop and Prakar 14. From what is the Jiva-Prajnapan?

## Translation:

**34]** **[Prajñāpana Sūtra (2)]** The absence of a Tirtha (sacred place) is called Atirtha. The absence of a Tirtha occurs in two ways: either the Tirtha has not been established at all, or after being established, it has been discontinued over time. 

In such Atirtha times, those who have attained Siddhi (liberation) are called Pratitirtha-siddha. 

In the absence of the establishment of a Tirtha (in the past), Marudevi and other Siddhas attained liberation. During the time of Marudevi and others' attainment of Siddhi, there was no establishment of a Tirtha. Similarly, during the time between the Tirthankaras like Suvidhinatha, the Tirtha was discontinued. At that time, those who attained Siddhi by obtaining the path to liberation through knowledge like Jatismaran (recollection of past lives), etc., are called Tirthavyavachheda-siddha. 

Both these types of Siddhas are Tirtha-siddha. 

**(3)** Tirthankara-siddha: Those who attain Siddhi as Tirthankaras are called Tirthankara-siddha. For example, in this Avasarpini (descending) time, from Rishabhadeva to Shri Vardhamana Swami, twenty-four Tirthankaras attained Siddhi as Tirthankaras. 

**(4)** Pratitirthankara-siddha: Those who attain Siddhi as ordinary Kevalis (liberated souls) are called Atirthankara-siddha. 

**(5)** Swayambuddha-siddha: Those who attain Siddhi without any teachings, by becoming self-enlightened (understanding the nature of the world) are called Swayambuddha-siddha. 

**(6)** Pratyekabuddha-siddha: Those who attain Siddhi as Pratyekabuddhas. 

Although both Swayambuddhas and Pratyekabuddhas attain Siddhi without any teachings, the difference between them is that Swayambuddhas become self-enlightened (gain enlightenment) through their own knowledge like Jatismaran, etc., without any external stimuli, while Pratyekabuddhas are those who become enlightened due to some external stimuli like a bull, a tree, a cloud, etc. 

It is said that Karkandu, etc., attained enlightenment due to the sight of a bull, etc., as an external stimulus. These Pratyekabuddhas, after attaining enlightenment, usually wander alone (individually) and do not wander in groups like the Sadhus (monks) of a Gachchha (order). 

In the Churni of Nandi-Adhyayan, it is said: "There are two types of Swayambuddhas: Tirthankara and Tirthankara-bhinna (different from Tirthankara)." 

Tirthankaras are included in the category of Tirthankara-siddha. Therefore, here, one should understand Tirthankara-bhinna Swayambuddhas. 

There are twelve types of Upadhi (accessories) based on the differences in the vessels, etc., of Swayambuddhas, while Pratyekabuddhas have two types of inferior and nine types of superior Upadhi, excluding the Pravarana (garment). 

The Shruta (scripture) of Swayambuddhas is sometimes Purvaadhit (studied in a previous life) and sometimes not. If it is Purvaadhit, then the Devatas (gods) provide them with a Linga (robe), or they go to the presence of a Guru (teacher) and accept the Muni-linga. If they are capable of wandering alone and have the desire to do so, then they wander alone, otherwise, they stay as Gachchhavasis (members of an order). If their Shruta is not Purvaadhit, then they usually go to a Guru and accept the Muni-linga and stay as Gachchhavasis. 

The Shruta of Pratyekabuddhas is usually Purvaadhit. They have studied at least eleven Angas (parts of scripture) in the inferior case and ten Angas in the superior case. The Devatas give them the Muni-linga, or sometimes they may be without a Linga.

## First, the five types of liberated souls:

(7) **Buddhabodhitsiddha** - Those who become liberated through the teachings of a Bodhisattvacarya (a fully enlightened teacher) are called Buddhabodhitsiddha.

**Strilingasiddha** - Among these liberated souls, some are **Strilingasiddha** (liberated souls with a female body). The characteristic that identifies a female is called **Strilinga**. It can be identified through three things: Veda (scripture), body structure, and attire. 

Here, the focus is on the body structure of a female. It is not about the Veda or attire because the Veda cannot be attained by a liberated soul, and attire is not authentic. 

Therefore, those who are liberated while having a female body are called **Strilingasiddha**. This refutes the statement "Women cannot attain liberation." The path to liberation is through right faith, knowledge, and conduct. This **Ratnatraya** (three jewels) can be attained by women as well as men. The female body is not an obstacle to practicing this path or teaching it.

(6) **Purushalingasiddha** - Those who are liberated while having a male body are called **Purushalingasiddha**.

(10) **Napumsakalingasiddha** - Those who are liberated while having a body that is neither male nor female, but **Napumsaka** (eunuch), are called **Napumsakalingasiddha**.

(11) **Swalingsiddha** - Those who are liberated while maintaining their own gender, i.e., in the attire of a woman, are called **Swalingsiddha**.

(12) **Aligasiddha** - Those who are liberated while maintaining a different gender, i.e., in the attire of a renunciant, are called **Aligasiddha**.

(13) **Grihalingasiddha** - Those who are liberated while maintaining the attire of a householder are called **Grihalingasiddha**, like Marudevi.

"Those who are bound by external causes like clothes are called **Pattayabuddha**. They follow the rules of the enlightened ones. They are called **Pattayabuddha** because they follow the rules."

"There are two types of **Pattayabuddha**: those who follow the rules strictly and those who follow them loosely. There are nine types of rules for those who follow them strictly, and they are like the rules of the **Pauras** (householders)."

"If a **Samyambuddha** (self-enlightened one) has a previous body, it is good. If not, then the rules of the body are followed in the presence of a teacher. If one is capable of following the rules of conduct and behavior, then one can follow them alone. Otherwise, one should follow them in a group."

"There are eleven types of rules for **Pattayabuddha** and ten types of rules for those who follow them loosely. They can give up their body or not.

2. This is the explanation of the **linga** (gender) and its characteristics. It is of three types: Veda, body structure, and attire. Here, the focus is on the body structure, not on the Veda or attire.

3. For a detailed discussion on the liberation of women, see **Prajnapanasutra**, **Mahavratti**, pages 20-22. See **Gomatsarasara** by Digambara Acharya Nemichandra, **Adyalapubbeya**, **Itthiveya** (there are forty of them). Twenty are **Napumsakaveya** (eunuchs), and they are liberated by remembering.

**[Prajnapana Sutra (14)]**  Ekasiddha - Those who become Siddha alone at one time are called Ekasiddha. **(15)** Anekasiddha - Those who become Siddha in more than one number at one time are called Anekasiddha. According to the principles, a maximum of 108 beings become Siddha at one time. / These 15 types are mentioned due to the difference in the title of the Anantar Siddhas.  

**Types of Paramprasiddha - Samsara Samapanna Jivas:** There are many types of these, therefore the scholars have not given a definite number of their types. / From Aprathamasamayasiddha to Anantasamayasiddha, all beings are in the category of Paramprasiddha. / Aprathamasamayasiddha - Those who do not have a first time of becoming Siddha, i.e., those who have become Siddha more than once, are called Aprathamasamayasiddha. Or, those who are contemporary with the first time in Paramprasiddhas are called Prathamasamayasiddha. / Similarly, in the third and subsequent times, they are called Dvitiyasamayasiddha, etc. Or, the statement 'Aprathamasamayasiddha' is made generally, and further, it is specifically stated - Dvisamayasiddha, Trisamayasiddha, Chatursamayasiddha, etc., up to Anantasamayasiddha, should be understood as Aprathamasamayasiddha - Paramprasiddha. Or, the meaning of Paramprasiddha is as follows: whoever is Siddha in any first time, the one who became Siddha one time before him is called 'Par'. / The one who became Siddha one time before him is also called 'Par'. The meaning of Paramprasiddha is that in the time when a being became Siddha, the beings who became Siddha in the previous times are all Paramprasiddha in comparison to him. / They have been becoming Siddha from infinite past time, they are all Paramprasiddha in comparison to anyone who is going to become Siddha in any desired first time. / Such Muktatma Paramprasiddha are Asansarasamapanna Jivas.

**3 Samsarasamapanna - Jiva Prajnapana:** Five types of Jiva Prajnapana. 
**18.** What is the (aforementioned) Samsarasamapanna Jiva Prajnapana? **18.** Samsarasamapanna Jiva Prajnapana is said to be of five types. It is as follows: (1) Ekaindriya Samsarasamapanna Jiva Prajnapana, (2) Dvoindriya Samsarasamapanna Jiva Prajnapana, (3) Triindriya Samsarasamapanna Jiva Prajnapana, (4) Chaturindriya Samsarasamapanna Jiva Prajnapana, and (5) Panchendriya Samsarasamapanna Jiva Prajnapana. /

[38] The **Prajñāpanā Sūtra** states that since earth is the foundation of all living beings, **Pṛthvīkāyika**s (earth-bodied beings) were first considered. **Apakāyika**s (water-bodied beings) depend on earth, so they were considered next. Then, their opposites, **Agnikāyika**s (fire-bodied beings) were considered, as fire increases with contact with air. Therefore, **Vāyukāyika**s (air-bodied beings) were considered next, and air is recognized by the vibration of distant creepers, etc. Therefore, **Vanaspatikāyika**s (plant-bodied beings) were considered next.

[20] What are **Pṛthvīkāyika** beings? [20] **Pṛthvīkāyika**s are said to be of two types: **Suhuma Pṛthvīkāyika**s (subtle earth-bodied beings) and **Bādar Pṛthvīkāyika**s (coarse earth-bodied beings).

[21] What are **Suhuma Pṛthvīkāyika**s? [21] **Suhuma Pṛthvīkāyika**s are said to be of two types: **Paryāpta Suhuma Pṛthvīkāyika**s (sufficiently subtle earth-bodied beings) and **Aparyāpta Suhuma Pṛthvīkāyika**s (insufficiently subtle earth-bodied beings). This is the description of **Suhuma Pṛthvīkāyika**s.

[22] What are **Bādar Pṛthvīkāyika**s? [22] **Bādar Pṛthvīkāyika**s are said to be of two types: **Sahabādar Pṛthvīkāyika**s (smooth coarse earth-bodied beings) and **Kharabādar Pṛthvīkāyika**s (rough coarse earth-bodied beings).

[23] What are **Sahabādar Pṛthvīkāyika**s? [23] **Sahabādar Pṛthvīkāyika**s are said to be of seven types: (1) **Kiṇhamattiya** (black), (2) **Nīlamattiya** (blue), (3) **Lohiyamattiya** (red), (4) **Hālihattiya** (yellow), (5) **Sukillāmattiya** (white), (6) **Paṇḍumattiya** (pale), (7) **Paṇagattiya** (grey).

## First Proclamation Chapter ] [41 Explanation of Sufficient and Insufficient for Subtle Earth-bodied Beings

Those beings whose sufficiencies are complete are called sufficient or sufficient ones. Those beings who have not completed their due sufficiencies are called insufficient or insufficient ones. There are two divisions of each, sufficient and insufficient - **Labdhi-paryapti** and **Karan-paryapti**, and **Labdhi-aparyapti** and **Karan-aparyapti**.

Those beings who die while remaining insufficient are called **Labdhi-aparyapti**, and those whose sufficiencies are not yet complete but will be complete are called **Karan-aparyapti**.

**Paryapti** is the completeness of a specific power of the soul, by which the soul takes in the appropriate pudgalas for food, body, etc., and transforms them into food, body, etc. That **paryapti**-like power arises from the accumulation of pudgalas.

In other words, the newly born soul in the place of origin, the pudgalas it first took in, the pudgalas it continues to take in, and those that have been transformed by contact with them, are transformed into food, body, senses, etc., by the power of which they are transformed. The completeness of that power is called **paryapti**.

There are six **paryaptis**: (1) **Aahar-paryapti**, (2) **Sharira-paryapti**, (3) **Indriya-paryapti**, (4) **Shwaso-chchwas-paryapti**, (5) **Bhasha-paryapti**, and (6) **Manah-paryapti**.

The power by which a being takes in external food (food-worthy pudgalas) and transforms them into khala and rasa is **Aahar-paryapti**.

The power by which the rasa-fied (rasa-transformed) food (food-worthy pudgalas) is transformed into rasa, blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow, and semen, these seven dhatus, is **Sharira-paryapti**.

The power by which the food pudgalas transformed into dhatu are transformed into senses is **Indriya-paryapti**. This can also be understood in another way: the power that takes in the pudgalas suitable for the five senses and transforms them into senses through the unknowingly emitted semen is **Indriya-paryapti**.

The power by which the pudgalas suitable for (breath and) exhalation are taken in, transformed into (breath and) exhalation, and then released after being held is **(Shwas-) Ucchwas-paryapti**.

The power by which the pudgalas suitable for speech (of the speech category) are taken in, transformed into speech, and released after being held for the purpose of speech is **Bhasha-paryapti**.

The power by which the pudgalas suitable for the mind are taken in, transformed into the mind, and released after being held for the purpose of thought is **Manah-paryapti**.

Of these six **paryaptis**, one-sensed beings have four, two-sensed, three-sensed, and four-sensed beings have five, and non-cognizant five-sensed beings have five, and cognizant five-sensed beings have all six **paryaptis**.

A being, at the very first moment of its birth, begins to manifest its potential **paryaptis** suitable for it. But they (**paryaptis**) are completed gradually.

For example, first **Aahar-paryapti** is completed, then **Sharira-paryapti**, then **Indriya-paryapti**, then **Shwaso-chchwas-paryapti**, then **Bhasha-paryapti**, and finally **Manah-paryapti** is completed. **Aahar-paryapti** is completed at the very first moment, and the rest of the **paryaptis** take an antarmuhurta time each to complete. But even the completion of all **paryaptis** takes only an antarmuhurta time. Because there are many alternatives within an antarmuhurta.

From this, both subtle earth-bodied and coarse earth-bodied...

##  42] The nature of the sufficient and insufficient should be understood in the Prajñāpanā Sūtra.

**Ślakṣṇa Bādarapṛthvīkāyika**

Ślakṣṇa earth is called so because it is soft like finely ground flour.  Living beings with the nature of such earth are also called Ślakṣṇa by treatment.  Those Bādarapṛthvī beings whose bodies are Ślakṣṇa-soft are called Ślakṣṇa Bādarapṛthvīkāyika.  This is mainly of seven types.  Among them, the meaning of Paṇḍumattika is that in some countries, dust is also known as 'Paṇḍ'.  The meaning of Panka-mṛttika has been given by the commentator as follows:  The Ślakṣṇa-soft mud that remains on the land after the flood waters of a river, etc., recede, which is also called 'Jalamal', is Panka-mṛttika.

**Khar Bādarapṛthvīkāyika**

The verses presented here explain 40 distinctions of Khar Bādarapṛthvīkāyika.  Finally, it is also said that all other gems like Padmarāga, etc., should be understood as belonging to this category.

**Nature of the Insufficient**

Among the two distinctions of Khar Bādarapṛthvīkāyika, the sufficient and the insufficient, the insufficient are either completely devoid of their sufficiencies or have not attained specific color, etc.  From this perspective, it cannot be said that they are of the color Krishna, etc.  The division of color, etc., in Bādar beings appears only when the body, etc., sufficiencies are complete, not in the incomplete state.  And those insufficient beings die while remaining insufficient due to the Ucchvāsa sufficiency.  Therefore, a clear division of color, etc., is not possible in them.  From this perspective, they are called 'Asamprāpta'.

**Thousands of Distinctions of Color, etc., in the Sufficient**

Those who are sufficient, whose four appropriate sufficiencies are complete, have thousands of distinctions due to the differences in their color, smell, taste, and touch.  For example, there are 5 distinctions of color, 2 of smell, 5 of taste, and 8 of touch.  Then, there are many degrees of intensity in each color, smell, taste, and touch.  For example, there are differences in the blackness of a bumblebee, a cuckoo, and kohl, etc.  Therefore, there are many distinctions of Krishna color like Krishna, Krishna-tara, and Krishna-tama, etc.  The same should be understood in the case of blue, etc., colors.  Similarly, there are many such distinctions related to smell, taste, and touch.  Similarly, countless colors like gray, spotted, etc., are produced by the mutual mixing of categories.  Similarly, thousands of distinctions of smell, taste, and touch occur due to the mixing of one smell with another, one taste with another, and one touch with another.

**Lakhs of Yonis of Such Earth-bodied Beings**

There are lakhs of Yonis of the above-mentioned earth-bodied beings.  This is what is said in the original text:  'Saṅkhejjāi Joṇippamuhasayasahassāi' - meaning 'There are lakhs of Yonis, including the main Yonis and the Yoni-doors'.  For example, there is a closed Yoni of earth-bodied beings in each color, smell, taste, and touch.  It is of three types:  Saccitta, Acitta, and Miśra.  Each of these has three distinctions:  Śīta, Uṣṇa, and Śītoṣṇa.  Due to the intensity of each of these Śīta, etc., there are many distinctions.  Although in this way, the Yonis with specific color, etc., in their own place become countless due to the distinctions of individuals, they are all considered to be in the same Yoni with respect to the species (general).  From this perspective, there are 1. (a) Prajñāpanā Sūtra, Malaya. Vṛtti, Folio 25-26 (b) See detailed discussion regarding Grāhāraparyāpti - Prajñāpanā. 28th Grāhārapada / 2. Prajñāpanā Sūtra.

## Prajñāpanā Sūtra Translation:

**[52]**  The Prajñāpanā Sūtra mentions the following as examples of *kuhaṇa* (aquatic plants): *kalhāra*, *kokanada*, *aravinda*, *tamaras* (lotus), *bhis*, *bhisamṛṇāla*, *puṣkara*, and *puṣkarāstibhaj* (puṣkarāstibhuj). Similarly, all other plants that grow in water should be understood as *jalaruha* (aquatic plants). This is the description of *jalaruha*.

**[52]** What are the types of *kuhaṇa* plants? **[52]** *Kuhaṇa* plants are said to be of many types. They are as follows: *pāya*, *kāya*, *kuhaṇa*, *kunakka*, *dravyahaḷikā*, *śaphāya*, *sadyāta* (svādhyāya?), *sitrāka* (chhatroka), *vaṁśī*, *nahiṭā*, and *kuraka* (vaśīna, hitākuraka). Similarly, all other plants of this type should be understood as *kuhaṇa*. This is the description of *kuhaṇa* plants.

**[53]** Trees (including clusters, shrubs, etc. by implication) have diverse forms. Their leaves are *ekajīvī* (supported by one life), and their trunks are also *ekajīvī*. For example, the leaves and trunks of the *tāla*, *sarala*, and *nārikela* trees are each supported by one life.

**[44]** Just as a mixture of mustard seeds, combined with *śleṣa* (adhesive) substances, appears as one, even though the mustard seeds are distinct, so too, the bodies of all living beings, united by the *śleṣa* of specific actions accumulated through attachment and aversion, appear as a single body, even though their individual bodies are different.

**[45]** Just as a *tilpappadī* (sesame seed cake) is formed by the combination of many sesame seeds, even though each seed is distinct, so too, the bodies of all living beings are combined.

**[46]** Thus, the description of the *bādaravaṇapatikāyika* (aquatic plant) beings with individual bodies is complete.

**[54]** What are the types of *sāhāranaśarīrabādaravaṇasatikāyika* (aquatic plant) beings with shared bodies? *Sāhāranaśarīrabādaravaṇasatikāyika* beings are said to be of many types. They are as follows: *pravaya*, *paṇaya*, *sevāla*, *lohiṇī*, *mihū*, *sthihū*, *sthibhagā*, *asakannī*, *sīhakannī*, *siunḍhi*, *tattō*, and *musuḍhī*.

The *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* states that the fruits of puṣya, kāliṅga, tumba, apuṣa, elvālu (chīrbhaṭ-chībhṛaḍ-kakṛī), vālu (chīrbhaṭ-kakṛī), and ghoṣāṭaka (ghoṣātaka), paṭola, tindūka, tindūsa fruits, all have leaves that are each inhabited by a single life. Their stalks, peduncles and gir (katāha), as well as their stamens (jaṭā) or stamenless (jaṭārhita) seeds (mījā), are each inhabited by a single life. // 14 // 

The *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* states that sapphāka, sadhyāta (sadhyāta), uvvehalia and kuhaṇ, as well as kandukya, are all inhabited by many lives. // 66 // 

The *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* states that flowers can be aquatic (jalaja) or terrestrial (sthala), stalked (vṛntabaddha) or stalkless (nālabaddha), and can be inhabited by a finite number of lives, an infinite number of lives, or even an immeasurable number of lives. // 6 // 

The *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* states that flowers with stalks are inhabited by a finite number of lives. The fruits of the *thūhara* (snihka) are inhabited by an infinite number of lives. Similarly, other flowers that resemble the *thūhara* flower should also be considered to be inhabited by an infinite number of lives. // 87 // 

The *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* states that the roots of the lotus (padmakanda), utpala (utpalinīkanda) and antarakanda, as well as the *jhillī* (a type of plant), are all inhabited by an infinite number of lives. However, their *bhis* and *mṛṇāla* are each inhabited by a single life. // 188 // 

The *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* states that the roots of the *palāṇḍakanda* (onion), *lahasūnakanda* (garlic), *kandalī* (a type of root) and *kusumbaka* (kustumbaka or kuṭumbaka) (a type of plant) are each inhabited by a single life. Any other plants that resemble these should also be considered to be inhabited by a single life. // 89 //

[First Pragyapana Pada] All these plants are endowed with infinite life-units (anantajivātmaka); however, in the case of tuber plants, there is a choice (vikalpana), (i.e., some tuber plants are endowed with infinite life-units and some are endowed with innumerable life-units).

[8] The life-unit born in the seed is the same as the one (in the seed), or it may be another (life-unit). Whatever life-unit is present in the root, the same (life-unit) is also present in the first leaf.

[6] All the sprouts (kisalaya) that emerge are indeed said to be of infinite body (anantakāya). The same (sprout-formed infinite body) that grows becomes either an individual body or an infinite body.

[10] The origination of the body, the grasping of the vital breaths, the inhalation and exhalation all occur at the same time for all (sadhāraṇa) plants. What is the grasping of many, that is also the grasping of one.

[101] The food, the grasping of water and air, and the common characteristics of the common (sadhāraṇa) life-units are like that.

[102] Just as a red-hot iron ball, having become similar to the nature of the fire, is entirely transformed into fire, in the same way, know that the entire (ananta) nigoda life-units are transformed into the nigoda form in a single body.

[103] It is not possible to see the individual bodies of the innumerable nigoda life-units, (but) the bodies of the infinite (ananta) nigoda life-units are visible.

[64] It is not possible to see the individual bodies of the countless Nigoda (micro-organisms). Only the bodies of the infinite Nigoda beings are visible. / / 103 / / [11] If one were to place a single Nigoda being in each region of the Lokakasha (space) and measure them, then there would be countless Lokakashas (spaces). (But there is only one Lokakasha, and it is also countless in its regions.) // 104 // / If one were to place a single being in each region of the Lokakasha, in each plant body, and measure them, then there would be countless Lokakashas. // 105 // / The number of Nigoda beings in each plant body is equal to a countless fraction of the Lokakasha (i.e., the number of regions in the Lokakasha is countless). And the number of Nigoda beings in each plant body that are not fully developed is equal to countless Lokakashas. And the number of ordinary beings is equal to infinite Lokakashas. / / 106 // [The meaning of the verse that has been thrown in] "These (previously mentioned) bodies have clearly described the form of those Nigoda beings. The subtle Nigoda beings are only knowable through the teachings of the Tirthankaras (by listening to their words). Because these (subtle Nigoda beings) are not visible to the eyes. / / 1 / / " Any other types of plants (not mentioned) should be understood as ordinary or belonging to each plant body, according to their characteristics. 55. [1] These (all the previously mentioned types of plant-bodied beings) are said to be of two types in summary. They are as follows: fully developed and not fully developed. / [55-1] Those that are not fully developed are not yet accomplished (they have not fulfilled their potential). [3] Those that are fully developed, in terms of their color, smell, taste, and touch, are like a thousand heavens, countless, and like a thousand times a thousand times a thousand. / The not fully developed beings are inferior to the fully developed beings.

Thus, the description of the one-sense-world-ending beings is complete. The discussion of the knowledge-declaration of all plant-bodied beings is presented in twenty-one sutras (sutras 35 to 55). The distinctions of plant-bodied beings, the twelve detailed distinctions of each body Badar plant-bodied beings like trees, clusters, etc., and the detailed description of the ordinary body Badar plant-bodied beings are discussed.

**The Prajñāpanā Sūtra Order**

Firstly, there are two divisions of plant bodies: Sūkṣma and Bādar. Then, there are two types of Sūkṣma: Pāryāpta and Apāryāpta. Next, there are two divisions of Bādar: Pratyeka-śarīra and Sādhāraṇa-śarīra. Following this, there are 12 divisions of Pratyeka-śarīra, such as वृक्ष (tree), गुच्छ (cluster), etc. The names of various plants are mentioned under each division. Then, many names, characteristics, and finally, the Pāryāpta-Apāryāpta divisions of Sādhāraṇa-vanaspatikāya are described.

**Explanation of the 12 Divisions of वृक्षादि**

**वृक्ष (Tree):** A tree is defined as having roots, leaves, flowers, fruits, branches, trunk, bark, etc. Examples include mango, neem, jamun, etc. Trees are of two types: Ekāsthika (having one seed or kernel in the fruit) and Bahubījak (having many seeds in the fruit). Mango, neem, etc. are examples of Ekāsthika trees, while Bijaura, Vat, Dāḍima, Udumbara, etc. are examples of Bahubījak trees.

Both types of trees are Pratyeka-śarīra, but their roots, tubers, trunks, bark, branches, and twigs contain countless living beings, while their leaves contain one living being each, and their flowers contain many living beings.

**गुच्छ (Cluster):** In modern language, this refers to a plant. Famous examples include वृन्ताकी (eggplant), Tulasi, Mātulingī, etc.

**गुल्म (Shrub):** This refers specifically to flowering plants. Examples include Champa, Jai, Jūhi, Kund, Mogara, Mallika, etc.

**लता (Creeper):** These are vines that usually climb trees. Examples include Champakalata, Nāgalata, Aśokalata, etc.

**वल्ली (Vine):** These are vines that typically spread on the ground. Examples include Kāligī (black pepper vine), Tumbi (pumpkin vine), Karkatikī (cucumber vine), Ela (cardamom vine), etc.

**पर्वक (Jointed Plant):** These are plants that have nodes or joints. Examples include Iksu (sugarcane), Sūṭh (ginger), Bent (bamboo), etc.

**तृण (Grass):** This refers to green grass, such as Kush, Arjun, Dūb, etc.

**वलय (Ring-shaped Plant):** These are plants with round, ring-shaped leaves. Examples include Tāl (palm), Kadalī (banana), etc.

**ओषधि (Herb):** This refers to plants that produce seeds after the fruit ripens. Examples include wheat, rice, lentil, sesame, mung bean, etc.

**हरित (Green Vegetable):** This refers specifically to green leafy vegetables, such as Chandaliya, Bathua, Palak, etc.

**जलरुह (Aquatic Plant):** These are plants that grow in water. Examples include Panak (water hyacinth), Shaival (algae), Padm (lotus), Kumud (water lily), Kamal (lotus), etc.

**कुहण (Mushroom):** These are plants that emerge from the ground by breaking it. Examples include Chhatrak (mushroom), etc.

**How can Pratyeka-śarīra be a single body of many living beings?**

**First example:** Imagine mixing whole mustard seeds with a sticky substance. They become one, forming a lump. Although each mustard seed is a complete body and remains separate in its own space, they appear as one due to the sticky substance holding them together. Similarly, the bodies of Pratyeka-śarīra living beings, being complete bodies, remain separate in their own space, but they appear as one due to their body aggregation.

Page #100:
---------------------------
## First Proclamation Chapter ] [ 67 They reside in their respective states of being, but due to being mixed with specific karma-like adhesive substances, these beings also appear to be one-bodied, uniform, and one-bodied in form. Second example - Just as a sesame seed cake is formed by many sesame seeds coming together (by mixing with adhesive substances like jaggery, etc.), the sesame seeds in that sesame seed cake remain separate, each in its own state of being, yet the sesame seed cake appears uniform. Similarly, even though the body aggregates of each embodied being are separate, they appear uniform! Characteristics of plants with infinite beings - (1) The root, tuber, stem, skin, branch, coral, flower, fruit, or seed that breaks, whose broken part appears circular, should be considered to have infinite beings. (2) The root, tuber, stem, and branch whose bark is thicker than the wood, i.e., the central pith, should be considered to have infinite beings. (3) The root, tuber, stem, skin, branch, leaf, and flower, etc., whose broken part is perfectly circular when broken, should be considered to have infinite beings. (4) The root, tuber, stem, bark, branch, leaf, and flower, etc., whose broken part or joint is filled with dust, or whose leaf, etc., when broken, does not show a circular break and the broken (joint) place is not filled with dust, but the broken place has a soil-like separation, i.e., it breaks like the cross-section of a field furrow that has been intensely heated by the sun's rays, then it should be considered to have infinite beings. (5) The leaf with or without milk (without milk) whose veins are not visible, or whose joint (joining the two parts of the leaf) is not visible at all, should also be considered to have infinite beings. (6) Flowers are of two types: aquatic and terrestrial. Both of these are also of two types each - stalked (like Atimuka, etc.) and stalkless (like paddy flowers, etc.). Among these flowers, some have a countable number of beings, some have an uncountable number of beings, and some have infinite beings. They should be known according to the Agamas. It is special that the stalkless flowers like paddy, etc., have been called by the Tirthankaras and Ganadharas as having a countable number of beings; but the flowers of the Snihupushpa, i.e., the fruit of the Thohar or other fruits like the Thohar, should also be considered to have infinite beings. (7) The Padmini tuber, Utpalini tuber, Antar tuber (a special tuber of aquatic plants) and the Jhillika plant, all these have infinite beings. It is special that there is one being in the Vis (Bhis) and Mrinal of the Padmini tuber, etc. (8) Saffaka, Sajjaya, Uvvehalia, Kahan, and Kanduka (due to regional differences) are infinite-bodied. (9) All buds are infinite-bodied when they sprout. Every plant body, whether it is a multi-bodied or a simple one, when it reaches the bud stage, has been called infinite-bodied by the Tirthankaras and Ganadharas. But the same bud, as it grows, later takes the form of a leaf, then it becomes a simple body or an infinite body or a multi-bodied being. Characteristics of plants with multi-bodied beings - (1) The root, tuber, stem, skin, branch, coral, leaf, flower, or fruit or seed, when broken, whose broken (broken) part has a diamond 1.

## English Translation:

**68.1** (1) When a piece of the *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* is seen, i.e., its fragments are not uniform, but diverse and jagged, one should understand that each (bodied) being is like the root, tuber, trunk, etc. (2) Where the bark is thinner than the wood (the central core) of the root, tuber, trunk, or branch, one should understand that it is inhabited by many beings. (3) Plants like *Palāṇḍukanda*, *Lahsunakanda*, *Kadalikanda*, and *Kustumba* should all be understood as having many beings within them. All such infinite plants devoid of the characteristics of fossils should be understood as having many beings within them. (4) The stalks (petioles), outer petals, and the basic granules of the leaves of all types of lotuses like *Padma*, *Utpala*, *Nalin*, *Subhaga*, *Saugandhika*, *Araviṇḍa*, *Kokanada*, *Śatapatra*, and *Sahasrapatra* are all inhabited by one being. Their inner leaves, stamens (filaments), and pollen are also inhabited by one being. (5) The axis, nodes, and *balimotaka* (the circular part surrounding the node) of all types of grasses like bamboo, *naḍa*, *ikṣuvaṭikā*, *samāsekṣu*, *ikkaḍa*, *karkara*, *sūṭhi*, *vihaṅgu*, and *dūba*, as well as plants with nodes, are all inhabited by one being. Their leaves are also inhabited by one being. However, their flowers are inhabited by many beings. (6) Each leaf (individually), stalk, calyx, pulp, and seeds with or without filaments of fruits like *pūṣya* and *kāliṅga* are inhabited by one being.

**Can the being of the seed become the being of the root, etc.?**

There are two states of a seed: the *yoni* state and the *ayoni* state. (1) When the seed does not abandon the *yoni* state but is abandoned by the being, then that seed is called *yoni-bhūta*. (2) It cannot be definitively said by a *chhadmastha* (a person who is not a true knower) whether the seed has been abandoned by the being. Therefore, nowadays, the *chetana* (conscious) or *achetana* (unconscious) that is *avidhvasta-yoni* (not destroyed *yoni*) is called *yoni-bhūta*. The *vidhvasta-yoni* (destroyed *yoni*) is regularly *achetana* (unconscious) and is therefore an *ayoni-bhūta* seed. Such a seed is not capable of germinating. The meaning is that *yoni* refers to the place of origin of the being. Only the *avidhvasta-śakti-sampanna* (undestroyed power-possessing) seed is *yoni-bhūta*, and it is in this that the being is born.

**The question is whether the same being from the previous seed is born in such a *yoni-bhūta* seed or whether a different being is born in it?**

The answer is that both possibilities can occur. The meaning is that the being that was in the seed abandoned the seed when its lifespan was exhausted. The seed became lifeless, but if that seed again receives the combined material of water, time, and earth, then perhaps the same previous being is born in that same previous seed, taking on the name and lineage of the root, etc. Sometimes, a new being, like an earth-bodied being, is also born in that seed.

**Characteristics of Ordinary-bodied, Cloud-plant-bodied Beings**

Ordinary plant-bodied beings are born together, their bodies are formed together, they simultaneously take in the *pudgalas* suitable for *prāṇāpāna* (inhalation and exhalation), and they breathe together. The taking in of *pudgalas* for food, etc., by one being is the taking in by many beings (dependent on that body). Similarly, the taking in of *pudgalas* for food, etc., by many beings is also the taking in of *pudgalas* for food, etc., by one being.

Page #102:
---------------------------
First, it is necessary to understand the concept of "Prajnapanapad" (the state of being aware). All living beings are dependent on the same body. The intake of food and air, the absorption of matter, and the process of breathing are all common to ordinary living beings. This is the characteristic of ordinary living beings. How can an infinite number of living beings exist within a single Nigoda body? The answer is: Just as a red-hot iron ball becomes completely fiery in the fire, so too should one understand the existence of infinite living beings within a single Nigoda body. We cannot see the bodies of one, two, three, or even countless Nigoda living beings because they do not have separate bodies. They are simply a mass of infinite living beings. In other words, they have only one body. We can only see the bodies of infinite living beings, but only those of the larger Nigoda living beings, not the smaller ones. This is because the bodies of the smaller Nigoda living beings, even though they are composed of infinite souls, are invisible (imperceptible to the eye). Their bodies are naturally formed from subtle elements. The fact that there is only one body for infinite Nigoda living beings is confirmed by the words of the omniscient, liberated Tirthankaras. The Tirthankaras say: "There are countless spheres in a Nigoda body the size of the point of a needle. Each sphere contains countless Nigodas, and each Nigoda contains infinite living beings." This statement should be understood in relation to the Audarik body. Their Tejas and Karman bodies are different. The Prajnapanapad of the two-sense beings of the world is described in 56. [1] What is the Prajnapanapad of the two-sense beings of the world? [56-1] The Prajnapanapad of the two-sense beings of the world is said to be of many types. (It is said to be of many types.) It is as follows: Pulakrimic, Kukshikrimic, Gandayalag, Goloma, Nupura, Saumangalak, Vanshimukha, Suchimukha, Gaujaloka, Jaloka, Jalayuk (Jalayushk), Shankha, Shankhanak, Ghulla, Khulla, Gudaj, Skandha, Varata (Varatika = Kaudi), Sauktik, Mauktik (Soutrik Mutrik), Kalukavasa, Ekatovritta, Dvidhatovritta, Nandikavat, Shambuk, Matrvaha, Shuktisamputa, Chandanak, Samudra 1.

**Definition of the word Tiryañcayaonika:** Those who move 'tir' - crooked, twisted, or curved, 'añcan' - are called tiryañca. Their place of origin, their yoni, is called 'tiryagyoṇi'. Those born in the tiryagyoṇi are called tiryamyaonikas.

**Meaning of 'Uraḥparisarpa' and 'Bhuja-parisarpa':** Those who move by crawling (parisarpaṇ) from their chest (uraḥ) are called 'uraḥparisarpa', like snakes and other terrestrial tiryañca-pañcendriyas. And those who move with the help of their arms, like weasels, rats, etc., are called 'bhuja-parisarpa'.

**Explanation of 'Prāsālika' (Uraḥparisarpa):** The word 'āsāliyā' has two Sanskrit forms: prāsālikā and prāsāliga. Who are called prāsālikā or prāsālik, what are their types, and where are they born? In answer to these questions, the Prajñāpanā Sūtrakāra, Śrī Śyāmarīyācārya, has quoted here the statement made by the Bhagavān to Gautama in another text. The verb 'sammūcchī' used in the sentence '_Prāsāliyā kahi sammūcchī_?' clearly indicates that 'āsālikā' or 'prāsālik' are not garbhaja, but sammūcchima. The origin of prāsālikā is in the human realm, within the two and a half islands. In fact, the human realm is called the two and a half islands, but the mention of their origin in the two and a half islands here is to indicate that the prāsālikā are born only in the two and a half islands, not in the salt sea or the Kālodhi sea. In the absence of any kind of disturbance, it is born in 15 karmabhūmis. The secret of this is that if there is no disturbance in the form of sushama-sushama, etc., or duḥṣama-duḥṣama, etc., in the 5 Bharata and 5 Airāvata regions, then the prāsālikā is born in 15 karmabhūmis. If there is any disturbance in the form mentioned above in the 5 Bharata and 5 Airāvata regions, then it is not born there. In such a (disturbing) situation, it is born in the five mahāvideha regions. This also

---------------------------
## First Proclamation:

The **Prasalika** is not born in the thirty **Akarmabhumis**, nor is it born everywhere in the fifteen **Karmabhumis** and **Mahavidehas**. However, it is born in the **Skandhavars** (military camps) of **Chakravartis**, **Baladevas**, etc.  

In addition to this, it is born in any of the settlements from **Grama-nivesh** to **Rajdhani-nivesh**, but only when the **Skandhavars** or **Grama-nivesh** are about to be destroyed. During the time of destruction of the **Skandhavars** or settlements, the **Prasalika** emerges from the earth below, tearing it apart. This is the description of the origin of the **Prasalika**.

The **Prasalika** has a size ranging from an infinitesimal part of a **Jghana Anguli** to twelve **Yojanas**. Its width and thickness are proportional to its size. The **Prasalika** is **Asangni**, **Mithyadristi**, and **Agnani**. Its lifespan is only a **Antarmuhurta**.

## Mahorags:

**Mahorags** are one **Anguli** to one thousand **Yojanas** in size. They are born on land but also move in water, as their nature is such. **Mahorags** are not found in this **Manushya Kshetra**, but are born in the islands and oceans beyond, and also in the mountains, **Devanagaris**, etc., in the oceans. Due to their extreme size, they are not born in water. This is why they are not seen in the **Manushya Kshetra**. Those **Urahparisarpas** described in the original text, which are ten **Angulis** or more in size, should be considered **Mahorags**.

## Meaning of "Darvokar" and "Makali":

**Darvi** means a **Kadhi** or **Chat**. Similarly, **Darvikar** is one who has a **fana** (hood). **Mukul** means one who is disabled from raising the **fana**, one who is without a **fana**.

## Specific Meanings of "Grama" etc.:

**Grama** - A settlement surrounded by a fence.
**Nagar** - A city where eighteen types of taxes are not levied.
**Nigam** - A settlement inhabited by many merchants.
**Khet** - A settlement surrounded by a wall of dust.
**Kurbhat** - A settlement surrounded by a small wall.
**Madamb** - A settlement where there is no other settlement within two **Kosas**.
**Dronamukha** - A place where travel is mainly by water or a harbor.
**Pattan** - A place accessible by horse, cart, or boat, or a market, a commercial center.
**Prakara** - A mine of gold, etc.
**Ashram** - A place of residence for **Tapasjas**.
**Sambadh** - A fortified underground place built by farmers for grain security or a place for travelers to stay.
**Rajdhani** - The place where the ruler of a state resides.

## Proclamation of All Human Beings:

"What is a human being? A human being is of two types: **Sammuchhima Manushya** and **Gambhavakantiya Manushya**."

**Explanation of *Akarmabhoomika*:** Those humans whose domain is devoid of the aforementioned *Karma*, who sustain themselves only from *Kalpavruksha*, are called *Akarmabhoomi* or *Akarmabhoomika*. 

**Explanation of *Antaradweepaka*:** The word *Antar* means middle. *Antaradweepa* refers to the islands in the middle of the salt sea. Those who live in these *Antaradweepa* are called *Antaradweepaga* or *Antaradweepaka*. These *Antaradweepaga* humans are of twenty-eight types, whose names are mentioned in the original text. *Antaradweepaga* humans are those who have the strength of *Vajra-Rishabha-Naracha-Samhanana*, who have the transformation like *Kankapkshi*, who have favorable wind speed, and who have a square body structure. Their feet are shaped like a tortoise, with a beautiful and strong structure. Their thighs are smooth, with little hair, and round like *Kuruvinda*. Their knees are hidden and properly connected. Their thighs are round like an elephant's trunk. Their waist is like a lion, their middle part is like a forest, their navel is like a right-handed conch, and their chest is broad, strong, and adorned with *Shreevatsa*. Their arms are long like the gate of a city. Their wrists are well-connected. Their palms and soles are red like a red lotus. Their neck is four fingers long, even, and round like a conch.

## First Proclamation Chapter [105]

Those who die due to **Mandarag-mohana-anubandha** (attachment to the five senses) go to the **Devaloka** (heavenly realm). Their death occurs due to yawning, coughing, sneezing, etc., but not due to any bodily pain.

**Where and in what condition are the Antaradvipas of the Antaradvipas?**

According to the **Agamas**, the Antaradvipas of the 66 Antaradvipas are situated on the projections of the **Himalaya** and **Shikhari** mountains, which extend into the **Lavanasamudra** (salt ocean).

**Description of the 28 Antaradvipas of the Himalaya Mountain:**

The **Himalaya** mountain, which divides the **Bharat** and **Hemvat** regions in **Jambudvipa**, is 25 yojanas deep in the earth, 100 yojanas high, and twice as wide as the **Bharat** region. It is the color of **hemamay chinanshuk** (golden rays of the sun). Its two feet are adorned with a multitude of **kantimaya manis** (radiant gems) of various types. Its expanse is uniform from top to bottom. It is adorned with 11 **ratnamay kutas** (gem-studded peaks) that touch the sky. Its base is **vajramay** (diamond-like), and its banks are adorned with various gems and gold. It occupies a space of 10 yojanas. It is 1000 yojanas long from east to west and 5 yojanas wide from south to north. In its middle is the **Padmahrda** (lotus heart), and it is surrounded by a row of **Kalpavrikshas** (wish-fulfilling trees), making it extremely beautiful. It touches the **Lavanasamudra** at its eastern and western ends.

From the point where the water of the **Lavanasamudra** touches the **Himalaya** mountain, two tusk-shaped projections extend in the east-west direction. The projection in the **Isanakoona** (north-east corner) is 300 yojanas away from the **Himalaya** mountain. It is 300 yojanas long and wide in the **Lavanasamudra**, with a circumference of 646 yojanas. This is the **Ekoruk** island, which is 500 dhanushas wide and adorned on all sides by a **Padmavaravedika** (lotus-shaped platform) that is two **gaus** (cows) high.

From the **paryanta** (end) of the **Himalaya** mountain, in the **dakshin-purvakoona** (south-east corner), 300 yojanas away, the second projection extends into the **Lavanasamudra**. This projection is the same length and width as the **Ekoruk** island and is called the **Prabhasik** island.

From the western end of the **Himalaya** mountain, in the **dakshin-paschimadisha** (south-west corner), 300 yojanas away, the third projection extends into the **Lavanasamudra**. This projection is the same size and is called the **Vaishanik** island.

From the western end of the **Himalaya** mountain, in the **paschimottaradisha** (north-west corner), 300 yojanas away, the fourth projection extends into the **Lavanasamudra**. This projection is the same size and is called the **Nangolik** island.

Thus, these four islands are situated in the four directions from the **Himalaya** mountain and are of equal size.

After these four islands, **Ekoruk** etc., there are four more islands, one in each direction, 400 yojanas further away. These islands are 400 yojanas long and wide, with a circumference of 1265 yojanas. They are adorned with the **Padmavaravedika** and **vanakhanda** (forest area) mentioned earlier. They are 400 yojanas away from the **vedika** (platform) of **Jambudvipa**. These islands are called **Hayakarna**, **Gajakarna**, **Gokarna**, and **Shashkulokarn**. The **Hayakarna** island is beyond the **Ekoruk** island, the **Gajakarna** island is beyond the **Prabhasik** island, the **Gokarna** island is beyond the **Vaishanik** island, and the **Shashkulokarn** island is beyond the **Nangolik** island.

After these four islands, **Hayakarna** etc., there are four more islands, one in each direction, 500 yojanas further away. These islands are 500 yojanas long and wide. They are situated in the four directions, just like the previous ones. Their circumference is 1581 yojanas. Their outer regions are also adorned with the **Padmavaravedika** and **vanakhanda** mentioned earlier. They are 500 yojanas away from the **vedika** of **Jambudvipa**.

##  The Prajapana Sutra Names

**106]** The Prajapana Sutra names are: Adarshamukha, Mendhamukha, Ayomukha, and Gomukha.  /  Of these, Adarshamukha is the island in front of Hyakarna, Mendhamukha is in front of Gajakarna, Ayomukha is in front of Gokarna, and Gomukha is in front of Shashkulikarna.  /  In front of these four islands, Adarshamukha etc., there are four more islands at a distance of six hundred yojanas in each of the four directions:  Prashvamukha, Hastimukha, Singhamukha, and Vyaghamukha.  /  These four islands are six hundred yojanas long and wide, with a circumference of 1897 yojanas, adorned with the aforementioned Padmavaravedika and Vanakhanda, and are located six hundred yojanas away from the Jambudvipa's vedika.  /  In front of these four islands, Ashvamukha etc., there are four more islands at a distance of seven hundred yojanas in each of the four directions:  Prashvakarna, Harikarn, Prakarn, and Karnpravaran.  These islands are seven hundred yojanas long and wide, with a circumference of 2213 yojanas, adorned with the aforementioned Padmavaravedika and Vanakhanda, and are located seven hundred yojanas away from the Jambudvipa's vedika.  /  Then, in front of these four islands, Ashvakarna etc., there are four more islands at a distance of eight hundred yojanas in each of the four directions:  Ulkamukha, Meghmukha, Vidyamukh, and Vidyuhant.  These islands are eight hundred yojanas long and wide, with a circumference of 2526 yojanas, adorned with the aforementioned Padmavaravedika and Vanakhanda, and are located eight hundred yojanas away from the Jambudvipa's vedika.  /  Then, in front of these four islands, Ulkamukha etc., there are four more islands at a distance of six hundred yojanas in each of the four directions:  Ghandanta, Lashtanta, Gudhadanta, and Shuddhadanta.  These islands are nine hundred yojanas long and wide, with a circumference of 2845 yojanas, adorned with the aforementioned Padmavaravedika and Vanakhanda, and are located six hundred yojanas away from the Jambudvipa's vedika.  /  These islands, located on the slopes of the Himavan mountain in all four directions, are twenty-eight in number (744 = 28).

**Description of the 28 Antaradvipas of the Shikhari Mountain:**  /  Similarly, on the Shikhari mountain, which is of the same color and size as the Himavan mountain, and is adorned with the same length, width, and depth of the Padmahad and the beautiful Pundarikahad, there are twenty-eight islands located in all four directions, starting from the point where the water of the Lavanasamudra touches the mountain, at the aforementioned distances and with the aforementioned sizes.  These islands are named Akoruk etc., and their length, width, circumference, and names are all the same as before.  Therefore, there are a total of fifty-six Antaradvipas on both sides.  The people living on these islands are also called by the same names.  /  For example, those living in Punjab are called Punjabis.

**Description of the Akarmabhumikas:**  /  Akarmabhumika humans are of thirty types.  In the human realm, which is in the form of two and a half islands, there are five Himavat, five Hairanyavat, five Harivarsha, five Ramyakavarsha, five Devakuru, and five Uttarakuru Akarmabhumis.  In these thirty regions of Akarmabhumis, there are thirty types of humans.  The types of humans living in these regions are named after these regions.  /  Of these, the humans in the five Himavat regions and the five Hairanyavat regions are one gavyu (cow) tall, have a lifespan of one palyopama, and are characterized by Vajrarishbhanaraachasanhanan and Samachaturasrasansthan.  They have sixty-four ribs on their back, eat once every day, and take care of their children for seventy-six days.  /  In the five Harivarsha and five Ramyakavarsha regions, the humans have a lifespan of two palyopama and are two gavyu tall. 

**1. Prajnapanasutra M. Vritti, pages 50 to 54**

**First Proclamation** [107 These are those who have Vajra-Rishabha-Naracha-Samhanana and Sama-Chaturasra-Sansthana. They eat after an interval of two days / They have 128 ribs on their back and they nurture their offspring for 64 days / In the five Devakuru and five Uttar Kuru regions, the lifespan of humans is three Palyopama and the height of their body is three Gau. These also have Vajra-Rishabha-Naracha-Samhanana and Sama-Chaturasra-Sansthana. They have 256 ribs on their back. They eat after an interval of three days and nurture their offspring for 46 days. In all these regions, like the Antar-Dvipas, the means of enjoyment and consumption of humans are fulfilled by Kalpa-Vrikshas. The only difference is that in the five Himavat and five Hairanyavat regions, the upliftment, strength and vigor of humans, the taste of the fruits of the Kalpa-Vrikshas there and the sweetness of the land there are infinitely more than the Antar-Dvipas in terms of Paryayas / All these things are infinitely more in the five Hari-Varsha and five Ramya-Varsha regions than those, and infinitely more in the five Devakuru and five Uttar Kuru than these / This is a brief description of the Akarma-Bhumikas.

**Aryan and Mlechchha Humans** - Five Bharat, five Airvat and five Maha-Videha, in these 15 regions, both Aryan and Mlechchha types of Karma-Bhumika humans reside. Aryan means - those who are far away from Heya Dharmas (adharmas or sins) and are close to or have attained Upadeya Dharmas (ahimsa, satya etc. Dharmas). Mlechchha are those - whose speech (language) and conduct are unclear and indistinct / In other words, those whose entire behavior is not in accordance with the noble people, should be considered Mlechchha. There are many types of Mlechchhas, which are mentioned in the original text. Most of these Mlechchhas have got their caste names from living in a particular country, for example - Shakas living in Shaka country, Yavanas living in Yavana country etc. /

**Types of Aryans and their characteristics** - **Kshetrarya** - Those born and living in the 25 Janapada-atmaka Aryan regions mentioned in the original text are called Kshetrarya. These regions are called Aryan because / In these, the birth of great men like Tirthankara, Chakravarti, Baldev, Vasudev etc. takes place. Regions other than these are called Anarya / **Jatyarya** - The 6 castes mentioned in the original text, Ambashtha etc. are Ibya-Abhyarchaniya and famous. People associated with these castes are called Jatyarya. **Kularyarya** - Those born in any of the 6 clans mentioned in the scriptures, Ugn etc. are called Kularyarya, in relation to the clan. **Karyarya** - Actions like Karma-Ahimsa etc. and those that are in accordance with the noble people and are livelihood-related are called Karyarya. The scripture writer has listed some types of humans related to Karyarya, like Doshika, Sautr etc. / You should understand the specifics yourself. **Shilparya** - Any craft that is in accordance with the Dharma-angas like Ahimsa etc. and the conduct of the noble people is called Aryan craft. Those who earn their livelihood from such Aryan craft are included in Shilparya. Some names have been mentioned by the scripture writer / The rest should be understood by your own thinking / **Bhasharya** - Ardha-Magadhi was the language of the common people and the noble people at that time, today its prevalent form is Hindi and various provincial languages. Therefore, the present era 1. Prajnapana Sutra Malaya. Vritti, Patraank 54

[108] In the Prajñāpanā Sūtra, those whose language is connected to high culture and civilization, whose language is not trivial and harsh, but is adorned with respectful, gentle, and beautiful words, can be called [Prajñāpānārya]. The nature of the remaining Jñānārya, Darśanārya, and Cāritrārya is clear. Those who are endowed with Samyakjñāna are called Jñānārya, those who are endowed with Samyakdarśana are called Darśanārya, and those who are endowed with Samyakcāritra are called Cāritrārya. Those who are endowed with Mithyājñāna, Mithyātva and Mithyadarśana, and Kucaitra, cannot be called Jñānārya, Darśanārya, and Cāritrārya respectively. The scholar has described those who are endowed with five types of Samyakjñāna as Jñānārya, those who are endowed with Sārāga and Vītarāga forms of Samyakdarśana as Darśanārya, and those who are endowed with Sārāga and Vītarāga forms of Samyakcāritra as Cāritrārya. He has explained the various sub-divisions of these from different perspectives. All those who have these sub-divisions are also included in Jñānārya, Darśanārya, and Cāritrārya. 

Sārāgadarśanārya and Vītarāgadarśanārya - The darśana which is endowed with Rāga, i.e., Kṣaya, is called Sārāgadarśana, and the darśana which is devoid of Rāga, i.e., Kṣaya, is called Vītarāgadarśana. From the perspective of Sārāgadarśana, the Ārya is called Sārāgadarśanārya, and from the perspective of Vītarāgadarśana, the Ārya is called Vītarāgadarśanārya. There are 10 types of Sārāgadarśana, such as Nisargaruchi. There are three characteristics, such as Paramārthasamstava, and eight conducts, such as Niḥśankita. Vītarāgadarśana is of two types: Upaśāntakṣaya and Kṣīṇakṣaya. The Āryas who are due to these two are called Upaśāntakṣayadarśanārya and Kṣīṇakṣayadarśanārya respectively. Upaśāntakṣaya-Vītarāgadarśanārya are those whose all Kṣayas have been pacified, and therefore, in whom the Vītarāgadśā has manifested. They are the Muni who are in the eleventh Guṇasthāna. Kṣīṇakṣaya-Vītarāgadarśanārya are those whose all Kṣayas have been completely destroyed, and therefore, in whom the Vītarāgadśā has manifested. They are the Mahāmuni who are in the twelfth to fourteenth Guṇasthāna. Those who have reached this state for the first time are called Prathamasamayavartī, and those who have been in this state for more than one time are called Aprathamasamayavartī. Similarly, Caramasamayavartī and Acaramasamayavartī are two divisions due to the difference in time. There are also two types of Kṣīṇakṣaya-Vītarāgadarśanārya due to the difference in state: those who are in the twelfth Guṇasthāna are called Chhadmastha, and those who are in the thirteenth and fourteenth Guṇasthāna are called Kevali. There are two types of Chhadmastha-Kṣīṇakṣaya-Vītarāga who are in the twelfth Guṇasthāna: Svayambaddha and Bṛddhabodhita. Then, from each of these two, there are two divisions due to the difference in state, as before: Prathamasamayavartī and Aprathamasamayavartī, and Caramasamayavartī and Acaramasamayavartī. Due to the difference in the Swami, there is also a difference in the darśana, and due to the difference in the darśana, there is also a difference in their personality (Āryatva). There are two divisions of Kevali-Kṣīṇakṣaya-Vītarāgadarśanārya: Sayogikevali and Ayogikevali. Those who have attained only knowledge, but are still endowed with Yogas, are called Sayogikevali, and those who have attained the Kevali-prayoga state are called Ayogikevali. They are only those who are in the fourteenth Guṇasthāna. Due to the difference in time, there are four divisions of each of these two: Prathamasamayavartī and Aprathamasamayavartī, or Caramasamayavartī and Acaramasamayavartī. Due to the difference in these, there is also a difference in the darśana, and due to the difference in the darśana, there is also a difference in the Darśananimittak Āryatva. 

Sārāgacāritrārya and Vītarāgacāritrārya - The cāritra which is endowed with Rāga, or the cāritra of a person who is endowed with Rāga, is called Sārāgacāritra, and the cāritra in which there is no presence of Rāga, or the cāritra of a Vītarāgapurusa, is called Vītarāgacāritra. There are two divisions of Sārāgacāritra: Sūkṣmasamprayā-Sārāgacāritra.

## Translation:

**First Knowledge-Declaration Chapter**

**(109) **There are two types of Aryas: those with subtle *kṣaya* (subtle passions) and those with gross *kṣaya* (gross passions). The former are called *sūkṣmasamprayā-cāritrārya* (Aryas with subtle conduct) and the latter are called *bādarasamprayā-cāritrārya* (Aryas with gross conduct).

**Subtle Conduct Aryas**

*Sūkṣmasamprayā-cāritrārya* are further divided into four categories based on their stage of development:

* **Prathamasamayavartī:** Those who are in the first stage of development.
* **Aprathama-samayavartī:** Those who are not in the first stage of development.
* **Cāramasamayavartī:** Those who are in the final stage of development.
* **Acāramasamayavartī:** Those who are not in the final stage of development.

The explanation of these categories should be understood as before.

*Sūkṣmasamprayā-cāritrārya* are further divided into two categories:

* **Sankliśyamāna:** Those who have fallen from the eleventh *guṇasthāna* (stage of spiritual development) to the tenth *guṇasthāna*.
* **Viśuddhyamāna:** Those who have risen from the ninth *guṇasthāna* to the tenth *guṇasthāna*.

**Gross Conduct Aryas**

*Bādarasamprayā-cāritrārya* are also divided into four categories as before: *prathamasamayavartī*, etc. They are further divided into two categories:

* **Pratipātī:** Those who are prone to falling.
* **A-pratipātī:** Those who are not prone to falling.

*Pratipātī* belong to the *upasamaśreṇī* (category of those who are prone to falling) and *a-pratipātī* belong to the *kṣapakaśreṇī* (category of those who are not prone to falling).

**Vītarāga (Free from Passions)**

There are two types of *vītarāga*:

* **Upasāntakṣayavītarāga:** Those who have subdued their passions.
* **Kṣīṇakṣayavītarāga:** Those who have weakened their passions.

**Upasāntakṣayavītarāga**

*Upasāntakṣayavītarāga* are those who are in the eleventh *guṇasthāna*. Their explanation and the explanation of their four categories should be understood as before.

**Kṣīṇakṣayavītarāga**

*Kṣīṇakṣayavītarāga* are further divided into two categories:

* **Chhadmasthakṣīṇakṣayavītarāga:** Those who have seemingly weakened their passions.
* **Kevalikṣīṇakṣayavītarāga:** Those who have truly weakened their passions.

**Chhadmasthakṣīṇakṣayavītarāga**

*Chhadmasthakṣīṇakṣayavītarāga* are further divided into two categories:

* **Swayambuddha:** Those who have attained enlightenment on their own.
* **Buddhabodhita:** Those who have attained enlightenment through the guidance of a teacher.

Both of these categories are further divided into four categories as before: *prathamasamayavartī*, etc. Their explanation should also be understood as before.

**Kevalikṣīṇakṣayavītarāga**

*Kevalikṣīṇakṣayavītarāga* are also divided into four categories as before: *prathamasamayavartī*, etc. They are further divided into two categories:

* **Sayogikevalī:** Those who have attained liberation with the presence of karma.
* **A-yogikevalī:** Those who have attained liberation without the presence of karma.

Their explanation should also be understood as before.

All these categories are called *tathārūpa cāritrārya* (true conduct Aryas) based on their respective stages of development.

**Sāmayika Cāritrārya (Conduct of Observance)**

**Sam** means free from attachment and aversion. **Samarūpa praya** is called **samaya**.

Alternatively, **sam** means right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct. **Samaya** refers to the benefits or attainment of these.

Alternatively, the word **samaya** is a symbol for all the actions of a *sādhu* (saint) because all their actions are free from attachment and aversion.

**Sāmayika** is that which is produced or accomplished by the aforementioned **samaya** or that which happens in **samaya**.

Alternatively, **samaya** itself is **sāmayika**, which means complete abstinence from all harmful actions.

**Mahāvratī** (those who have taken the great vows) *sādhu* and *sādhvī* (female saints) are said to have **sāmayika cāritra** because when they take the great vows, they adopt **sāmayika cāritra** which is the complete cessation of all harmful actions or practices.

Although **sāmayika cāritra** includes all the conduct of a *sādhu*, specific conduct like *chedopasthāpanā* (specific practices) are separately mentioned because they bring about greater purity and special qualities in **sāmayika cāritra**.

**Sāmayika cāritra** is divided into two categories:

* **Itvarīka:** Short-term.
* **Yāvatkathīka:** Lifelong.

**Itvarīka sāmayika cāritra** is given to a *śaikṣa* (newly initiated) in the *Bharata* and *Airavata* regions, and in the *tīrtha* (spiritual field) of the first and last *tīrthankara* (liberated soul) until the great vows are bestowed upon them. In other words, the conduct of a *śaikṣa* from the time of initiation until the bestowal of the great vows is **itvarīka sāmayika cāritra**.

**Yāvatkathīka sāmayika cāritra** is the conduct of *sādhu* in the *tīrtha* of the twenty-two *tīrthankara* between the *Bharata* and *

## 110] [ The Prajñāpanā Sūtra states that those who have been initiated for the first time are not given initiation a second time for the purpose of Mahāvatāra-upanā.  /  Those Āryas who practice this type of Samāyika-cāritra are called Samāyika-cāritra-Ārya.  Chhedopasthāpanika-cāritra-Ārya - The cāritra in which the chhed (gap) of the previous paryāya is filled and the Mahāvrata is established is called Chhedopasthāpanika-cāritra.  It is of two types - Sāticāra and Niraticāra  /  Niraticāra Chhedopasthāpanika-cāritra is that which is given to a Śekṣa (newly initiated) who practices Itvrika Samāyika or is adopted when moving from one tīrtha to another.  For example, the Chhedopasthāpanika-cāritra given to a Śramaṇa who comes from the tīrtha of Pārśvanātha to the tīrtha of Vardhamāna upon accepting the cāritra in the form of the five Mahāvrata is Niraticāra.  Sāticāra Chhedopasthāpanika-cāritra is that which is given to a sādhaka who has violated one of the मूलगुण (Mahāvrata) as a form of Mahāvrata-uccāraṇa.  /  Both these types of Chhedopasthāpanika-cāritra occur in the Sthitikalpa - that is - in the tīrtha of the first and last Tīrthankaras, not in the tīrtha of the twenty-two intermediate Tīrthankaras.  Due to the practice of Chhedopasthāpanika-cāritra, the sādhaka is called Chhedopasthāpanika-cāritra-Ārya.  The nature of Parihāra-viśuddhi-cāritra-Ārya - Parihāra is a specific tapa (austerity) by which faults are avoided.  Therefore, the cāritra in which purity is attained through the said Parihāra tapa is called Parihāra-viśuddhi-cāritra.  It has two divisions - Nivishmānaka and Nivishṭakāyika  /  The cāritra in which the sādhaka enters and practices austerity according to the tapa-vidhi is called Nivishmānaka-cāritra, and the cāritra in which the sādhaka has completed the practice of austerity according to the tapa-vidhi is called Nivishṭakāyika-cāritra.  Those sādhakas who adopt these types of cāritra are also called Nivishmāna and Nivishṭakāyika respectively.  Nine sādhakas together practice this Parihāra tapa.  Of these, four sādhakas are Nivishmānaka, who practice this tapa, and four sādhakas are their followers, that is, they perform Vaiyāvṛttya, and one sādhaka is a Kalpasthita Vācanācārya.  Although all sādhakas are endowed with great śraddhā, this is a type of Kalpasthita Prācārya established among them.  The Parihāra tapa of the Nivishmāna sādhakas is as follows - The knowers have described the Parihārikas' tapa in the winter, summer, and rainy seasons as being of three types - inferior, medium, and excellent - as follows: In the summer, the inferior tapa is Caturthabhakta, the medium is Shashṭhabhakta, and the excellent is Ashṭamabhakta.  In the winter, the inferior tapa is Shashṭhabhakta (Belā), the medium is Ashṭamabhakta (Telā), and the excellent is Dashamabhakta (Chaulā).  /  In the rainy season, the inferior tapa is Ashṭamabhakta, the medium is Dashamabhakta, and the excellent is Dvādashabhakta (Panchaulā).  Prāyambila is performed during the parana.  Five (things) are accepted and two are rejected in the bhiksha.  The Kalpasthita also performs Prāyambila in the same way every day.  In this way, after practicing austerity for six months, the Parihārika (Nivishmānaka) sādhaka becomes an Anucāri (follower); and the four Anucāris become Parihārikas for six months.  Similarly, the Kalpasthita (Vācanācārya-padastthita) sādhaka also becomes a Parihārika after six months and practices austerity for the next six months, and the remaining sādhakas become Anucāris and Kalpasthita.  /  This Kalpa has been briefly described as being of 18 months.  After the Kalpa is completed, those sādhakas either adopt the Jinakalpa or return to their own gaccha.  The pratipaddyamānaka of the Parihāra tapa practices this tapa either in the presence of the Tīrthankara Bhagavān or in the presence of someone who has practiced this Kalpa as a Tīrthankara.

## Translation:

**First Proclamation of Conduct**

[111] Those who have accepted the [Jain] principles from a [Jain] monk, they accept it from him; not from others. The conduct of such monks is called **Pariharavishuddhicharitra**. Those who practice this conduct are called **Pariharavishuddhicharitraarya**. There are two types of **Pariharavishuddhicharitris**: **Itvarik** and **Yavatkathik**.

**Itvarik** are those who attain the same **Kalpa** or **Gachchha** after the end of a **Kalpa**. Those who immediately accept the **Jinkalpa** without any obstruction as soon as a **Kalpa** ends are called **Yavatkathikcharitris**. **Itvarikparivaravishuddhiks** do not experience **Devaditrit Upsarga**, **Pranaharaka Atanka** or unbearable pain due to the influence of the **Kalpa**, but **Yavatkathiks** who accept the **Jinkalpa** may experience **Upsarga** along with the feeling of **Jinkalpi**.

**The nature of Sukshmasamprayacharitraarya**: The conduct in which **Sukshma** (subtle) **Samprayaya** (passion) in the form of subtle **Lobha** (greed) remains, is called **Sukshmasamprayacharitra**. This conduct occurs in the tenth **Gunasthan** where only a subtle part of **Sanjwalanakshaya** remains. There are two types of this conduct: **Vishuddhamanak** and **Sanklishyamanak**. The conduct of those who ascend the **Kshapak Shreni** or **Upshama Shreni** is **Vishuddhamanak**, while the **Sukshmasamprayacharitra** of a monk who falls from the eleventh **Gunasthan** after reaching there through the **Upshama Shreni** and returns to the tenth **Gunasthan** is called **Sanklishyamanak**. Those who practice **Sukshmasamprayacharitra** are called **Sukshmasamprayacharitraarya**.

**Yathakyatcharitraarya**: The word **Yathakyatcharitra** is a combination of three words: **Yatha** (truly), **Pra** (completely), and **Akyatcharitra** (free from passions). It means truly and completely free from passions, or the conduct that is known and famous in the entire world as passionless, is called **Yathakyatcharitra**. There are two types of this conduct: **Chhadmasthik** (of the eleventh and twelfth **Gunasthan** beings) and **Kaivalik** (of the thirteenth **Gunasthan** beings - **Sayogikevali** and the fourteenth **Gunasthan** beings - **Ayogikevali**). Those who practice this type of **Yathakyatcharitra** are called **Yathakyatcharitraarya**.

**Four types of Devas**: [136] How many types of **Devas** are there? **Devas** are of four types: 1. **Bhavanavasi**, 2. **Vanamantara**, 3. **Joisiya**, 4. **Vemaneya**.

## First Proclamation

[115] These, for the sake of adornment, perform various kinds of specific and more specific responses. Like the Kumaras, their forms, attire, language, ornaments, weapons, vehicles, and conveyances are grand. They are as passionate and playful as the Kumaras. The term "Vaṇavyantara" refers to the difference in form of the gods, meaning space, shelter, or place. Those gods whose space (shelter), building, city dwelling, etc., are their forms are called Vyantara. The dwellings of the Vaṇavyantara gods are in the first Ratnakaṇḍa of the Ratnaprābhā earth, leaving one hundred yojanas above and below, and the remaining one hundred yojanas in the middle part. Their cities are also in the Tiryaṅgloka, and their abodes are in the three lokas. For example, their abodes in the Ūrdhvaloka are in Pāṇḍukavana, etc. The second meaning of the word Vyantara is those who are not different (separated) from humans, because many Vyantara serve as servants of humans like Chakravarti, Vasudeva, etc. Or those who have various spaces like Parvatāntara, Kandarāntara, or Vanāntara, etc., as their shelter are called Vyantara. Or the etymological meaning of Vānamantara is the space of forests, Vanāntara, those who live in the Vanāntara are Vānamantara. There are eight types of Vaṇavyantara, including Kinnara, etc. There are ten types of Kinnara: (1) Kinnara, (2) Kimpuruṣa, (3) Kimpuruṣottama, (4) Kinnarottama, (5) Hṛdayanga, (6) Rūpaśālī, (7) Anindita, (8) Manorama, (9) Ratipriya, and (10) Ratiśreṣṭha.

Gandharva are of twelve types: (1) Hāhā, (2) Hūhū, (3) Tumbarava, (4) Nārada, (5) Ṛṣivādika, (6) Bhūtavādika, (7) Kādamva, (8) Mahākādamva, (9) Raivata, (10) Viśvāvasu, (11) Gītarati, and (12) Gītayaśa. Yakṣa are of thirteen types: (1) Pūrṇabhadra, (2) Maṇibhadra, (3) Śvetabhadra, (4) Haritabhadra, (5) Sumanobhadra, (6) Vyatipātika-bhadra, (7) Subhadra, (8) Sarvatobhadra, (9) Manuṣyayakṣa, (10) Vanādhipati, (11) Vanāhāra, (12) Rūpayakṣa, and (13) Yakṣottama.

_The form of the Jyotilaka deva - those who illuminate the loka with their light are called Jyotilaka. Or those who illuminate are the Jyotiṣa-vimāna, the gods who reside in those Jyoti-vimāna are called Jyotilaka deva. Or those who illuminate with the Prabhāmaṇḍala-like Suryamaṇḍala, etc., which are dependent on the crowns on their heads, are called Suryadi Jyotilaka deva. In the front part of the crown of Suryadeva, there is a Surya-shaped form, in the front part of the crown of Candradeva, there is a Candra-shaped form, in the front part of the crown of Grahadeva, there is a Graha-shaped form, etc._

The form of the Vāimanika Devas - Vāimanika Devas are of two types - (1) Kalpopag or Kalpopapann and (2) Kalpātita / The meaning of Kalpopapann is - Kalpa, meaning conduct - that is - the conduct and limits of Indra, Sāmanika, Trayastriśādi. Those Devas who have conduct in accordance with the said Kalpa are called Devas, and those who do not have such Kalpa are called Kalpātita / The Saudharma etc. Devas are Kalpopapann, and the nine Graveyaka and the five Anuttaroupapātika Devas are called Kalpātita. These Vimana Granveyaka are called so because they are situated on the neck of the Lokapurusha. The meaning of Anuttar is - the highest and best Vimana / These Devas are called Anuttaroupapātika because they are born in those Anuttar Vimanās. // Prajñāpanā Sūtra: The first Prajñāpanāpada is complete.

---------------------------
This is the second section (**Sthanapad**) of the **Prajnapana Sutra**. The first section discussed the two types of beings: worldly and liberated.  Since it is essential to understand the dwelling places of these beings, this second section explores that.

It is important to consider the dwelling places of beings because Jainism, unlike other philosophies, does not consider the soul (**Atma**) to be all-pervasive. Instead, it believes the soul is limited to the size of its body and is capable of expansion and contraction. Additionally, Jainism does not believe the soul is eternally static (**Kutesthanitya**) but rather believes it is eternally changing (**Parinama-nitya**). This means the soul takes birth in various forms (**Paryaya**) in the world and occupies a specific place while inhabiting a body. Therefore, it becomes crucial to understand which being resides in which place.

From the perspective of other philosophies, the soul is always present everywhere in the universe. They may consider the dwelling place based on the body, but they do not need to consider the location of the soul.

This **Sthanapad** discusses two types of dwelling places for beings based on the original text: (1) **Permanent** and (2) **Temporary**.

The permanent dwelling place is where the being resides from birth to death, referred to as **Swasthan** by the scholars. The temporary dwelling place is further divided into two types: **Upapat** and **Samudghāt**.

According to Jain terminology, a being is identified by a new name (**Paryaya**) after the end of its previous life (**Purvabhava**). For example, if a being was a god in its previous life but is going to be a human after death, it is identified as a human after the end of its godhood. However, since the soul is not all-pervasive, the soul, limited to the size of its body, needs to travel to its new birthplace after death. Since the being has left the god realm and has not yet reached the human realm, this period is considered its travel time.

The region the being travels through during this journey is also considered its dwelling place.

---------------------------
[118] The Prajñāpanā Sūtra refers to this same location as 'Upapāta-sthāna'. It is clear that this location is relevant, but it is also essential. Another relevant location is 'Samudghāta' / According to Jainism, the realms of a living being expand in specific contexts such as pain, death, or reaction, which is called 'Samudghāta' in Jain terminology; it is of many types. During Samudghāta, the realms of the living being (ātma-) remain in the body location, but they also extend outwards to some extent until the time of Samudghāta. Therefore, it is also necessary to consider the relevant or possible dwelling place of the living being in relation to Samudghāta. This is why the present verse considers three types of dwelling places for various living beings: sva-sthāna, upapāta-sthāna, and samudghāta-sthāna. The Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama also considers the location-field in the Khettaṇāgama-prakaraṇa, taking into account sva-sthāna, upapāta, and samudghāta. The present 'sthāna-pada' describes the locations and order of the categories of living beings, which indicates that the first verse does not consider many common categories such as the one-sensed, but it does consider common categories such as the five-sensed / The locations of all the specific categories mentioned in the first verse are not considered in the present verse, but the locations of the main categories are considered / The locations of all other categories of living beings are considered in relation to the aforementioned three locations, but only 'sva-sthāna' is considered for the Siddhas / The reason for this is that Siddhas do not have upapāta; because other living beings experience the rise of name, lineage, and lifespan karma before attaining their respective birthplaces, they acquire these names and attain the motion to take a new birth. Siddhas lack karma, so they are not born in the form of Siddhas, but they attain their own nature from the perspective of the 'siddhi' location, which is their sva-sthāna. The motion of liberated beings to the Lokānta-sthāna, according to Jain belief, does not involve touching the Ākāśa-pradeśas, so even though liberated beings move, they do not touch the Ākāśa-pradeśas, so they are not considered to have a 'location' in those pradeśas. From this perspective, Siddhas do not have upapāta-sthāna / Siddhas also do not have samudghāta-sthāna, because samudghāta occurs for beings with karma, and Siddhas are without karma. Therefore, only 'sva-sthāna' is considered for Siddhas. The statement 'One-sensed beings are pervasive throughout the entire universe' does not refer to only one one-sensed being, but to the entire category of one-sensed beings in a general sense. And the three locations should be understood collectively, not separately. Two-sensed, three-sensed, and four-sensed beings are not in the entire universe, but in an innumerable part of the universe.

Discussion: The locations of the Prithvi Kayikas are described - In the present three Sutras (Sutras 148 to 150), the locations of all types of Prithvi Kayikas, Badara, Sukhma, sufficient and insufficient, are described. Definition and types of 'location' - The place where a Jiva lives, from the beginning to the end of life, is called 'Svasthaana', the place where a Jiva stays in between, facing the Svasthaana, before leaving one Bhava and taking birth in another Bhava, is called 'Uppaata-Sthaana', and the place where the Jiva resides during the Samudghaata, the extent of the sky in which they reside, is called 'Samudghaata-Sthaana'. Where and in how many regions do the Prithvi Kayikas reside in the three Lokas? The Shastrakara has described the Svasthaana of the Prithvi Kayikas (Badara-Sukhma-sufficient-insufficient) from three perspectives - (1) in the seven Naraka Prithvis and in the eighth Ishta-Praarabhara Prithvi, then (2) in the different locations of Adholaka, Urdhvaloka and Tiryanchloka, and (3) also in the Svasthaana, in an innumerable part of the Lok. In addition, the Uppaata-Sthaana of the Badara sufficient-insufficient is stated to be in an innumerable part of the Lok and in the entire Lok respectively, and the Samudghaata-Sthaana of both the aforementioned Prithvi Kayikas is stated to be in an innumerable part of the Lok and in the entire Lok respectively." 1.

## Translation:

[122] With respect to the *upapata* (state of being born), the *badar prithvikayik* (earth-bodied) *paryaptak* (sufficient) beings are said to be in an innumerable part of the *lok* (universe). Their attainment of their *svasthan* (native place) is *upapata*. With respect to this *upapata*, they are in an innumerable part of the *chaturdasha rajvatmak lok* (fourteen-jewel-like universe), because their *ratnaprabha* (jewel-light) and other *samudita svasthan* (combined native places) are also in an innumerable part of the *lok*. There are few *badar prithvikayik* *paryaptak* beings, so even when they are in the *apantaral* (intermediate space) during *upapata*, they are all in an innumerable part of the *lok*. There is no fault in this statement.

With respect to *samudhata* (state of dying), the *badar prithvikayik* *paryaptak* beings are also in an innumerable part of the *lok*. Even when they are in the *kshetrantavarti* (intermediate space) in the *samudhata* state, they are still in an innumerable part of the *lok*. This is because *badar prithvikayik* beings, whether they have *sopkram ayu* (finite lifespan) or *nirupkram ayu* (infinite lifespan), when one-third of their *bhujyaman ayu* (current lifespan) remains, they bind the *parbhava ayu* (future lifespan) and perform the *maranantik samudhata* (death-causing *samudhata*). At that time, their *atma pradesh* (soul-space) that has spread out as a result of their *danda* (punishment) is also in an innumerable part of the *lok*, because these beings are few in number. The lifespan of these *badar prithvikayik* beings has not yet diminished, so they are still available in sufficient numbers even in the *samudhata* state.

With respect to *svasthan*, there are *svasthan* in an innumerable part of the *lok*, such as *ratnaprabha* (jewel-light) and others. All of them together are also in an innumerable part of the *lok*. For example, the *ratnaprabha* earth is a thousand *yojan* (leagues) in diameter. Similarly, the different thicknesses of other earths should also be considered. The *patal kalash* (underground vessels) are also one hundred thousand *yojan* deep. The *narakavas* (hells) are also three thousand *yojan* high. The *vimanas* (flying vehicles) are also thirty-two hundred *yojan* wide. Therefore, since all of these are finite, they are all together in an innumerable part of the *asankhyat pradeshatmak lok* (universe of innumerable spaces).

*Aparyaptak* (insufficient) *badar prithvikayik*: With respect to *upapata* and *samudhata*, these beings are in all *lokas*. *Aparyaptak* *badar prithvikayik* beings, even when they are in *vigrahgati* (movement of the body) in the *upapata* state, experience the *vedana* (pain) of their lifespan in their *svasthan* due to *vishist vipak* (specific consequences). They are born from all *kayas* (bodies) except *devas* (gods) and *narakas* (hells). When they *udvat* (die), they go to all places except *devas* and *narakas*. When they die and go to their *svasthan*, they are still called *aparyaptak* *badar prithvikayik* beings, even though they are in *vigrahgati* (movement of the body) in the *upapata* state. They are naturally abundant in number, so they are present in all *lokas* with respect to *upapata* and *samudhata*.

Some of them experience *upapata* through *rijugati* (straight path), and some through *vakragati* (curved path). *Rijugati* is well-known. The establishment of *vakragati* is as follows: At the time when many beings are collected in the first *vakra* (curve), other beings fill that *vakradesha* (curved space). Similarly, there is a continuous flow of filling in the *vakra* (curve) during the collection of the second *vakradesha* and also during the *vakra* (curve) formation.

The three places of *sukshma prithvikayik* (subtle earth-bodied) *paryaptak* (sufficient) and *aparyaptak* (insufficient) beings: The *sukshma prithvikayik* *paryaptak* and *aparyaptak* beings are all of the same type. There is no difference between them with respect to the consideration of *purvakrit sthan* (previously created place) and others. There is nothing special about them. They are just as sufficient as the others, and they are devoid of *nanatva* (diversity). *Nanatva* is not seen in them due to *deshabheda* (difference in place). The meaning is that there is no difference between the *paryaptak* and *aparyaptak* beings based on their *svasthan* (native place).

[126] In the *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* (location), the *samudghāta* is found in the entire universe, the *upapāta* in an innumerable part of the universe, and the *svathāna* in an innumerable part of the universe. [156] "Where, Bhante, are the locations of the *paryāpta* and *aparyāpta* subtle *tejas* bodies described?" [156] "Gautama, the subtle *tejas* bodies, both *paryāpta* and *aparyāpta*, are all of the same type, without any distinction, they are not diverse, O Venerable *śramaṇa*, they are said to be all-pervading." 

Discussion: The location of the *tejas* body is described in these three sūtras (sū. 154 to 156) by outlining the *svathāna*, *upapāta* and *samudghāta* locations of the *paryāpta* and *aparyāpta* subtle *tejas* bodies. The location of the *paryāpta* subtle *tejas* bodies - in relation to their *svathāna*, they are within the human realm, i.e., within the two and a half islands and two oceans of the human realm. Due to the absence of *vyāghāta*, they are found in the fifteen *karmabhūmis* - five *Bharata*, five *Airavata*, and five *Mahāvideha*. And when there is *vyāghāta*, they are found in the five *Mahāvideha* realms. The meaning is that extremely smooth or extremely rough time is called *vyāghāta*. When such *vyāghāta* occurs, the fire is extinguished. When the *pāra* in the five *Bharata* and five *Airavata* realms is *suṣama-suṣama*, *suṣama*, and *suṣama-duṣṣama*, then it is called extremely smooth time. On the other hand, *duṣṣama-duṣṣama* *pāra* is called extremely rough time. If both these types of time occur, then there is *vyāghāta* - fire extinction. If such a *vyāghāta* situation exists, then the *paryāpta* subtle *tejas* bodies are found in the five *Mahāvideha* realms. If there is no such *vyāghāta*, then the *paryāpta* subtle *tejas* bodies are found in the fifteen *karmabhūmi* realms. In the *vigraha* movement, in the *upapāta* state, facing the attainment of the said *svathāna*, they are found only in an innumerable part of the universe, because they are very few at the time of *upapāta*. In relation to *samudghāta*, due to the *māraṇāntika* *samudghāta*, they are spread out in the form of punishment in the *prātmā* regions, and even then, being few, they are found only in an innumerable part of the universe. In relation to *svathāna*, they are also found in an innumerable part of the universe. Because the human realm is 45 lakh yojanas long and wide, which is only an innumerable part of the universe. The location of the *aparyāpta* subtle *tejas* bodies - the *aparyāpta* beings live in the shelter of the *paryāpta* beings, so where the *paryāpta* beings are, there are the *aparyāpta* beings. In relation to *upapāta*, the *aparyāpta* subtle *tejas* bodies are found in the two upper *kapāṭas* of the universe and in the *tiryagloka* border.

The second spatial division [127 and a half dvipa-samudras (island-oceans) in extent, as wide as 127 and a half dvipa-samudras, and extending east, west, south, and north to the self-luminous Raman ocean, are the two gates, which, like the gates at the time of the Kevali's liberation, touch the end of the upper realm and the end of the lower realm. These are called the 'two upper gates'. In addition, the meaning of 'tatta' is 'sthala' (thala) / that is, the 'tatta' (sthala) resembling a 'sthala' is called the 'tiryagloka' (horizontal realm) / the meaning is that the entire 'tiryagloka' (horizontal realm) resembling a 'sthala' is 1800 yojanas thick up to the vedika of the self-luminous Raman ocean. The conclusion is that, in comparison to the 'upapata' (place of birth), the two upper gates of the realm and the 'tiryagloka' (horizontal realm) resembling a 'sthala' are the places of the 'badar' (inferior) 'tejaskaayik' (radiant) 'aparayaapta' (deficient) beings / According to the variant reading 'loyassa dosuddha kavaadesu tiriyaloyata?', this meaning is also possible - those who are situated in those two upper gates of the realm are 'tat-sth' (situated there) / thus - in the 'tiryagloka' (horizontal realm) resembling 'tat-sth' (situated there) - that is - in the 'tiryagloka' (horizontal realm) situated inside those two upper gates, they are / The conclusion is that the 'upapata' (place of birth) of the 'badar' (inferior) 'tejaskaayik' (radiant) 'aparayaapta' (deficient) beings is in the aforementioned two upper gates and also in the 'tiryagloka' (horizontal realm) (situated) in those same gates, not elsewhere. It should be understood here that the 'badar' (inferior) 'aparayaapta' (deficient) 'tejaskaayik' (radiant) beings with the 'abhimukhanamgotr' (facing name and lineage) are of three types: (1) 'ekabhavik' (one-life), (2) 'badghayushk' (bound-lifespan), and (3) 'abhimukhanamgotr' (facing name and lineage) / Those beings who will be born in the 'badar' (inferior) 'aparayaapta' (deficient) 'tejaskaayik' (radiant) form in the next life after a particular life are called 'ekabhavik' (one-life), those beings who have bound the lifespan of the 'badar' (inferior) 'aparayaapta' (deficient) 'tejaskaayik' (radiant) with a remaining time of one-third of the lifespan of the previous life, etc., are called 'badghayushk' (bound-lifespan), and those who are experiencing the lifespan, name, and lineage of the 'badar' (inferior) 'aparayaapta' (deficient) 'tejaskaayik' (radiant) directly after leaving the previous life, that is, experiencing the 'badar' (inferior) 'aparayaapta' (deficient) 'tejaskaayik' (radiant) state, are called 'abhimukhanamgotr' (facing name and lineage). Of these three types of 'badar' (inferior) 'aparayaapta' (deficient) 'tejaskaayik' (radiant) beings, the first two - 'ekabhavik' (one-life) and 'badghayushk' (bound-lifespan) - are 'badar' (inferior) 'aparayaapta' (deficient) 'tejaskaayik' (radiant) only due to the 'dravya-nikshepa' (material deposition), not due to the 'bhavana-nikshepa' (mental deposition), because these two do not experience lifespan, name, and lineage at that time; therefore, they do not have authority here, but only the 'abhimukhanamgotr' (facing name and lineage) 'badar' (inferior) 'aparayaapta' (deficient) 'tejaskaayik' (radiant) beings should be considered to have authority here, because they are the ones who obtain the 'upapata' (place of birth) in the form of 'praabhimukhya' (facing towards) the attainment of their own place. Although, from the perspective of the 'rij-satranaya' (straightforward path), they also obtain the name 'badar' (inferior) 'aparayaapta' (deficient) 'tejaskaayik' (radiant) due to experiencing the lifespan, name, and lineage of the 'badar' (inferior) 'aparayaapta' (deficient) 'tejaskaayik' (radiant) beings, even though they are situated outside the aforementioned pair of gates and the 'tiryagloka' (horizontal realm), however, here, due to accepting the perspective of the 'vyavahar-naya' (practical path), those who are situated in the pair of gates in the same series in their own place, and those who have entered the 'tiryagloka' (horizontal realm) from their own place, are called 'badar' (inferior) 'aparayaapta' (deficient) 'tejaskaayik' (radiant) beings; the rest, who are situated in the interval of the gates, are not, because they are 'visham-sthana-varti' (situated in a different place) / Thus, those who have not yet entered the aforementioned pair of gates and have not entered the 'tiryagloka' (horizontal realm), are still situated in the previous life, therefore, they are not counted among the 'badar' (inferior) 'aparayaapta' (deficient) 'tejaskaayik' (radiant) beings / It is also said: 'Panayalallakhapihala dunni kavaada ya chhisi pritta. Logante tesin'to je teja te u vipati.'

[128] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra, i.e., forty-five lakh yojanas wide, two doors, which touch the limits of the universe in all six directions. Within them, those who are luminous are taken into account here. Its establishment (nature) is as follows: Therefore, this sūtra has been explained from the point of view of practical conduct. From the point of view of the aggregate, the Bādar Aparāpta-Tejaskaayikas are insufficiently luminous, and from the point of view of the space-aggregate, they are present in all the universes. This should be understood as follows: In the middle (interspaces) of the two doors described above, the subtle earth-bodied beings, etc., are born in the Bādar Aparāpta-Tejaskaayikas and perform the death-ending aggregate. At that time, they expand their self-regions outwards to the limits of the universe in terms of their body size in terms of width and thickness, and in terms of length. As will be said further in the Avagāhanā-Saṃsthāna-pada, *[Pr.] "O Bhagavan! How large is the bodily Avagāhanā of the earth-bodied being who has performed the death-ending aggregate?" [U.] "Gautama! (Their bodily Avagāhanā) is body-sized in terms of width and thickness, and in terms of length, it is an innumerable part of a finger and extends to the limits of the universe." After that, they, the subtle earth-bodied beings, etc., extend their self-regions in the form of a staff to their place of origin, and while present in the interspace motion (disintegration motion), they experience the lifespan of the Bādar Aparāpta-Tejaskaayikas, and therefore they are called Bādar Aparāpta-Tejaskaayikas. They exist in the disintegration motion only in the aggregate state, and the beings in the aggregate state permeate all the universes. From this point of view, they are called all-universe-pervading in relation to the aggregate. Other teachers say: The Bādar Aparāpta-Tejaskaayika beings are very numerous; because from the shelter of one sufficient being, innumerable insufficient beings are born. They are also born in the subtle ones, and the subtle ones are present everywhere. Therefore, the Bādar Aparāpta-Tejaskaayikas, at the end of their respective existences, perform the death-ending aggregate and fill all the universes. Therefore, there is no fault in calling them all-universe-pervading from the point of view of the whole, in relation to the aggregate. 'From the point of view of their own place, the Bādar Aparāpta-Tejaskaayikas are in an innumerable part of the universe, because the insufficient beings are born from the shelter of the sufficient ones. The place of the sufficient ones is the human realm, which is only an innumerable part of the entire universe. Therefore, it is appropriate to say that they are in an innumerable part of the universe. * 'O Bhagavan! How large is the bodily Avagāhanā of the earth-bodied being who has performed the death-ending aggregate?' 'Gautama! It is body-sized in terms of width and thickness, and in terms of length, it is an innumerable part of a finger, and in terms of height, it extends to the limits of the universe.' —Prajñāpanā. M.

## Prajñāpanā Sūtra [158 u.]

Gautama! Where the locations of the sufficient Bādar-vāyu-kāyika are, there the locations of the insufficient Bādar-vāyu-kāyika are said to be. In terms of *upapāta*, they are in all the lokas, in terms of *samudghāta*, they are in all the lokas, and in terms of *svasthāna*, they are in countless parts of the lokas.

## Prajñāpanā Sūtra [156 u.]

Bhagavan! Where are the locations of the sufficient and insufficient Sūkṣma-vāyu-kāyika said to be?

Gautama! The Sūkṣma-vāyu-kāyika, who are sufficient and who are insufficient, are all of the same type, without any distinction (without any special characteristics or differences), without any diversity, and O Āyushman Śramaṇa! They are pervading all the lokas.

## Explanation of the Locations of the Vivecana-vāyu-kāyika

The locations of the Bādar, Sūkṣma, and their sufficient and insufficient Vāyu-kāyika beings have been explained in these three sūtras (Sū. 157 to 156) from all three perspectives.

* **'Bhavana-chhiddesu'** = In the gaps and spaces of the dwellings of the Bhavana-pati-devas.
* **'Bhavana-nikkhuḍesu'** = In the openings of the dwellings, like windows, etc.
* **'Nira-ya-nikkhuḍesu'** = In the openings of the Narakas, like windows, etc.

**Sufficient Bādar-vāyu-kāyika:** In terms of *upapāta*, *samudghāta*, and *svasthāna*, they are in countless parts of the lokas; because wherever there is empty space, there is air. There is a lot of empty space in the lokas. Therefore, there are many sufficient Vāyu-kāyika beings.

**Insufficient Bādar-vāyu-kāyika:** In terms of *upapāta* and *samudghāta*, the insufficient Bādar-vāyu-kāyika beings are pervading all the lokas; because except for the Devas and Narakas, beings are born in the insufficient Bādar-vāyu-kāyika from all other kāyas.

Insufficient Bādar-vāyu-kāyika are also found in *vigraha-gati*, and they have many *svasthāna*. Therefore, from the perspective of *vyavahāra-naya*, there is no obstacle to the pervasiveness of the sufficient and insufficient Bādar-vāyu-kāyika in all the lokas. Their pervasiveness in all the lokas is well-known in terms of *samudghāta*; because they can be born in all the Sūkṣma beings and everywhere in the lokas. In terms of *svasthāna*, the insufficient Bādar-vāyu-kāyika beings are in countless parts of the lokas, as has been explained before.

Where are the places of the sūksmavanaspatikāyikas who are paryāptakas and those who are aparyāptakas said to be? [162 v. Gautama! The sūksmavanaspatikāyikas, who are paryāptakas and who are aparyāptakas, are all of one kind, without any distinction, without any diversity, and O Āyusman Śramaṇa! They are said to be pervading all the lokas. The three sūtras presented in the praṇāpanā of the places of the vivecana-vanaspatikāyikas, have presented the praṇāpanā of the svathāna, upapātasthāna and samudghātasthāna of the bheda of the bādar-sūksma vanaspatikāyikas who are paryāptakas and aparyāptakas. The places of the paryāpta-bādaravanaspatikāyikas are where there is water, there is vegetation, from this point of view, there are paryāpta bādaravanaspatikāyika beings in all the water places. In terms of upapāta, they are in all the lokas, because their svathāna is Dhanodadhi etc., in them there are beings like algae etc. who are bādar-nigoda. The bhava-sthiti of the sūksma-nigoda beings is only for a moment, after that they are born in the bādar-paryāpta-nigodas and experiencing the age of the bādar-nigoda-paryāpta, they get the name bādar-paryāptavanaspatikāyika in terms of the perfectly pure ṛjusūtranaya; in terms of upapāta, they pervade all time and all lokas / In terms of samudghāta, they are also pervading all the lokas; because when the bādar-nigoda, by binding the income related to the sūksma-nigoda, and by doing the māranāntika-samudghāta at the end of their life, spread their ātmā-pradeśas to the utpatti-deśas, until then their age of the paryāpta-bādar-nigoda does not diminish. Therefore, even at that time, they remain bādar-paryāpta-nigoda and in the samudghāta-avasthā, they are pervading all the lokas / From this point of view, it is said that the bādar-paryāptavanaspatikāyikas are pervading all the lokas in terms of samudghāta. In terms of svathāna, they are in an innumerable part of the loka, because all the aforementioned places like Dhanodadhi etc., even when combined, are only in an innumerable part of the loka. " 1.

It is said. Those hells are round inside, square outside, and shaped like a knife at the bottom. They are always enveloped in dense darkness, devoid of the light of planets, moon, sun, stars, and other celestial bodies. Their bottom is covered with a layer of fat, grease, pus, blood, and a coating of flesh mud. Therefore, they are impure, disgusting, extremely foul-smelling, the color of the fire of the Kapotraranga, harsh to the touch, unbearable, and inauspicious hells.

##  [Prajñāpanā Sūtra]

**144]** The **Aśubha (unfortunate)** are **Naraka (hells)**. In those Narakas, there are **Aśubha pains**. Here, the locations of the **Tamas-Tamaḥ-Pṛthvī** (dark earth) Narakas, both sufficient and insufficient, have been described. In relation to **Upapāta** (rebirth), they are in an innumerable part of the **Loka** (world). In relation to **Samuddhāta** (emergence), they are in an innumerable part of the **Loka**. And in relation to **Svasthāna** (own place), they are also in an innumerable part of the **Loka**. O **Ayushman Śramaṇa** (venerable monk)!, in these (aforementioned places), many **Nairyika** (hell beings) reside in the **Tamas-Tamaḥ-Pṛthvī**. They are described as black, with black radiance, (terrible) causing deep tremors, fearful, excellent tormentors (causing terror), and extremely black in color. They (hell beings) live in constant fear, always terrified, always causing terror to each other, always distressed (by sorrow), and always experiencing the direct experience of the extreme misfortune and associated fear of hell. 

**(Meaning of the Sangrahaṇī Gāthās)** (The thickness of the Naraka-Pṛthvīs, in numbers exceeding one lakh, are as follows): 1. Eighty (thousand), 2. Thirty-two (thousand), 3. Twenty-eight (thousand), 4. Twenty (thousand), 5. Twelve (thousand), 6. Sixteen (thousand), and 7. The lowest one, eight (thousand). (The word 'Yojana' should be added to all of them). 

**133**

**(The land area of the Naraka-vāsa)** (Leaving one thousand Yojanas above and below, up to the sixth Naraka: in numbers exceeding one lakh): 1. Seventy-eight (thousand), 2. Thirty (thousand), 3. Twenty-six (thousand), 4. Eighteen (thousand), 5. Sixteen (thousand), and 6. Fourteen (thousand) in the sixth Naraka-Pṛthvī. All these are numbers exceeding one lakh Yojanas. 

**134-135**

**(The number of Naraka-vāsa)** (Up to the sixth Naraka, in numbers exceeding one lakh): 1. (In the first Pṛthvī) Thirty (lakh), 2. (In the second) Twenty-five (lakh), 3. (In the third) Fifteen (lakh), 4. (In the fourth Pṛthvī) Ten lakh, 5. (In the fifth) Three (lakh), and 6. (In the sixth Pṛthvī) One less than five (lakh), and 7. (In the seventh Naraka-Pṛthvī) only five **Anuttara Naraka (hell)**. 

**136**

**Discussion:** The description of the locations of the Nairyika - These eight Sūtras (Sū. 167 to 174) shed light on the number of locations of the general Nairyika and then, in order, the locations of the Nairyika of the seven Narakas, the nature of those locations, and the nature and circumstances of the Narakas residing in those locations. The descriptions mentioned in the texts and Sūtras are mostly similar, except for a few things. 

**The number of Naraka-vāsa:** The total number of Naraka-vāsa in the seven Narakas is 84 lakh, which is described in the Sangrahaṇī Gāthās. In addition, the description of where the Narakas reside (in which region) is also given in the aforementioned Sangrahaṇī Gāthās, such as: 1. Leaving one thousand Yojanas above and one thousand Yojanas below, the Narakas of the first Pṛthvī reside in the middle region of one lakh seventy-eight thousand Yojanas; and so on. 

The description of the location, etc., of the Narakas of the seven Pṛthvīs is mostly similar.

## Second Place [145 Naraka-avasa]

The land of Naraka-avasa is covered with pebbles, but when the Narakas step on them, it feels as if their feet are being cut by knives. Due to the absence of light, there is always dense darkness. Like a dark night covered with clouds, there is always darkness there; because there is no light from the luminous planets, sun, moon, etc., or their radiance. The land is covered with mud made of foul-smelling substances like fat, grease, pus, blood, flesh, etc., so these Naraka-avasa are always dirty, foul-smelling, or malodorous. There is also a very unpleasant, terrible stench, like that of the carcasses of dead cows, buffaloes, etc.

The Naraka-avasa are like the deep blue flame (like the color of a pigeon) that comes out when iron is blown with a bellows, because they are hot everywhere except for the place where they were born. This statement should be understood in relation to other earths except the sixth and seventh. It will be said later that the Naraka-avasa of the sixth and seventh hells are not like the color of pigeon-colored fire.

The touch of these Naraka-avasa is extremely harsh and unbearable, like the edge of a sword. They are also very inauspicious to look at. The pains of these hells are also extremely inauspicious or unpleasant due to unbearable sound, form, smell, taste, and touch.

The Narakas are black, ugly, and terrifying in their body structure, nature, and circumstances. A black radiance emanates from their bodies. Just seeing them makes one shudder, or they create fear and trembling in other Narakas. For this reason, they constantly create terror. And they are always fearful, distressed, terrified, anxious, and constantly experience the unpleasant fear of hell.

## The Location of the Five-Sensed Tiryancha Yonis

[175] "Where, Venerable Sir, are the locations of the five-sensed Tiryancha Yonis, both those that are sufficient and those that are insufficient?"

[148] It is said that there are seven crore, seventy-two lakh Bhavanavasi Devas residing in one lakh seventy-eight thousand yojanas in the middle of a thousand yojanas traversed (crossed) and another thousand yojanas left below. These Bhavanas are round on the outside and square on the inside, and are shaped like the seed of a lotus flower at the bottom. They are surrounded by deep and wide ditches and trenches, the difference of which is clear. They are adorned with ramparts, balconies, doors, toranas and gateways. They are surrounded by various mechanisms, Mahaśilās (large stones) or Mahayaṣṭīs (large sticks), pestles, weapons called Musuṇḍhī; and they are impregnable to enemies, always victorious, always safe, and composed of forty-eight chambers, adorned with forty-eight garlands, free from troubles, auspicious, and guarded by the armies of auspicious Kinnara Devas.

Their toranas and the parts of the gateways are adorned with sandalwood pots. They are adorned with garlands of long, abundant, and round flowers hanging from top to bottom; and they are also adorned with the treatment of fresh, fragrant flowers of five colors.

**Discussion**

The description of the places of all the *bhavanavāsī* gods - In these eleven sūtras (from 177 to 187), the author has described in detail the places, the number of *bhavanavāsas* and their characteristics, the nature, splendor, power, influence, etc. of the *bhavanavāsī* gods, from the general *bhavanavāsī* gods to the ten types of *Asura* gods, including those in the south and north directions, and then the *Indras* of each of their respective groups (from various perspectives). Finally, the *saṁgrahaṇī* verses mention the number of *bhavanavāsas*, *sāmānika* and *prātmaraṣṭaka* gods of each type of *bhavanavāsī* god, the names of the twenty *Indras* of the *dakṣiṇātya* and *audīcya* groups, and the color of the body and clothing of each of the ten types of *bhavanavāsī* gods.

The translation preserving the Jain terms is as follows:

The locations of the Jyotishka devas (celestial beings associated with astronomical objects) have been described. [Gautama!] In this Ratnappabhā (earth), in the vast expanse of the terrestrial region, at a height of seven hundred yojanas, extending to ten hundred yojanas in breadth, and spread out infinitely in the domain of the Jyotishka, there are countless thousands of Jyotishka vimānas (celestial abodes) where the Jyotishka devas reside. 

Those vimānas are of the shape of half-moon, made of all kinds of precious gems, shining brightly like the rising sun, adorned with various jewels, gold, and precious stones, having victory banners and canopies fluttering, their peaks touching the sky, surrounded by jeweled cages and networks, decorated with crescent moons and gems, soft, fragrant with the scent of divine trees, beautiful, pleasing to the sight, and magnificent in appearance.

In this [region], the locations of the Jyotishka devas, both the principal and subordinate ones, have been described. They occupy a large part of the three worlds. There, many Jyotishka devas reside, such as the Sun, Moon, Planets (Śukra, Śanaiścara, Rāhu, Dhūmaketu, Budha, Aṅgāraka), the fixed stars, the twenty-eight constellations, the five-colored stars, the wandering stars, the stationary ones, the ones with circular motion, the ones with irregular motion, the great ones, and the shining ones (Sūtra 188).

It is long east-west, wide north-south, shaped like a half-moon, and has a color and radiance like a garland of jewels and a mass of lights. Its length and width are not only countless koṭi yojanas, but also countless koṭi-koṭi yojanas, and its circumference is also countless koṭi-koṭi yojanas. It is made entirely of gems, it is pure, (and all the other descriptions, ) up to "it is a model" (should be understood according to Su. 166).

There, they should be said to have their own lakhs of Vimana, their own thousands of Sāmaṇiya devas, just as it has been said (in Su. 196) about the Audhika (ordinary) Vēmānika, so also it should be said about these. Up to thousands of Prātmārakkha devas, and the dominion, leadership, etc. of many other Sōhaṁmagakappa-dwelling Vēmānika devas and devīs, up to "they dwell" ("Viharamti") (according to Su. 166) should be said.

## Second Place [183]

**[183]**  The **Achimali-Bhasarasipphabha** (a type of celestial being) is described as being like **Sanankumara** (Su. 166 [1]) in terms of its dwelling place.  It is said that **Pranaya-Panaya** (another type of celestial being) have four hundred **Vimana-Avasas** (celestial abodes) as their dwelling place (Su. 166).  Just as **Sohhamma** (Su. 197 [1]) is the **Avatansaka** (guardian) of the **Panaya** (a type of celestial being), so too are the **Badisagas** (another type of celestial being) the **Avatansakas** of all **Acha** (a type of celestial being) (Su. 166).  The **Pranaya-Panaya** (celestial beings) have their **Pazzatta-Apazatta** (permanent and impermanent) dwelling places in the **Thana** (a type of celestial abode) which are located in the **Loka** (world) in an **Asankhejjabhage** (incalculable portion).  Many **Pranaya-Panaya** (celestial beings) reside there, who are **Mahiddhiya** (great) and **Prabhasamana** (radiant) (Su. 166).  They dwell in their hundreds of **Vimana-Avasas** (celestial abodes) (Su. 196).

**[205-1]**  **Question:**  **O Bhagavan!** Where are the dwelling places of the **Paryaptaka** (sufficient) and **Aparyaptaka** (insufficient) **Anata** (a type of celestial being) and **Pranata** (a type of celestial being) described?  **O Bhagavan!** Where do the **Pranata-Pranata** (celestial beings) reside?

**[205-1] Answer:**  **O Gautama!** Above the **Sahasrar Kalpa** (a type of celestial time period), in the same direction and same **Vidisha** (a type of celestial region), (as described in Su. 199-1) extending upwards, there are two **Kalpas** (celestial time periods) called **Anata** and **Pranata**.  They are long in the east-west direction and wide in the north-south direction, shaped like a crescent moon, and are like a **Jyotimala** (string of lights) and **Diptirasi** (radiant mass) in their brilliance.  The rest of the description (as mentioned in Su. 199-1) is similar to the description of the **Sanatkumara Kalpa**.  In these **Kalpas**, there are four hundred **Vimana-Avasas** (celestial abodes) of the **Anata** and **Pranata** (celestial beings), as it is said.  The description of the **Vimana-Avasas** (celestial abodes) is similar to the previous description.  Just as the **Avatansaka** (guardian) of the **Soudharma Kalpa** is described in Su. 197-1, so too should the **Avatansaka** (guardian) of these (celestial abodes) be described.  The special feature is that there is a fifth **Avatansaka** (guardian) in the middle of these (four).  These **Avatansakas** are completely made of jewels, are pure, and (the description of the middle is according to Su. 196) should be described as "similar".  In these **Avatansakas** (guardians), the dwelling places of the **Paryapta-Aparyapta** (sufficient-insufficient) **Panata-Pranata** (celestial beings) are described.  These dwelling places are in the **Loka** (world) in an **Asankhejjabhage** (incalculable portion) in all three aspects.  Many **Anata-Pranata** (celestial beings) reside there, who are **Mahiddhiya** (great) and (according to Su. 196) should be understood as "radiant".  They (the **Anata-Pranata** celestial beings) wander there, ruling over their hundreds of **Vimana-Avasas** (celestial abodes).

**[2]**  **Panaye** (a type of celestial being) **Yastha Devi-Deva** (a type of celestial being) **Devaraya** (a type of celestial being) resides there, just as **Sanankumara** (Su. 169 [2]) is described.  (Similarly, the **Pranatendra** (a type of celestial being) should be understood here).  The special feature is that (this **Pranatendra**) rules over four hundred **Vimana-Avasas** (celestial abodes), twenty thousand **Samanika** (a type of celestial being), eighty thousand **Pratmarakshaka** (a type of celestial being), and many other celestial beings.  (The description of his wandering is according to Su. 196).

**[205-2]**  Here, **Deveindra** (a type of celestial being) **Devaraja** (a type of celestial being) **Pranata** (a type of celestial being) resides, just as **Sanatkumaraendra** (a type of celestial being) is described in Su. 199-2.  (Similarly, the **Pranatendra** (a type of celestial being) should be understood here).  The special feature is that (this **Pranatendra**) rules over four hundred **Vimana-Avasas** (celestial abodes), twenty thousand **Samanika** (a type of celestial being), eighty thousand **Pratmarakshaka** (a type of celestial being), and many other celestial beings.  (The description of his wandering is according to Su. 196).

**[206-1]**  **Question:**  **O Bhanta!** Where are the dwelling places of the **Dharana-Uchchuta** (a type of celestial being) described?  **O Bhanta!** Where do the **Parana-Aachchuta** (a type of celestial being) reside?

**[206-1] Answer:**  **O Goyama!**  Above the **Kalpas** (celestial time periods) of the **Pranaya-Panaya** (celestial beings), in the same direction and same **Vidisha** (a type of celestial region), there are two **Parana-Aachchuta** (a type of celestial being).

[188] [Prajñāpanasūtra [210 u.] Gautama! Above this earth, which is full of jewels and very even and beautiful, there are many hundreds of yojanas, many thousands of yojanas, many lakhs of yojanas, many crores of yojanas, and many koṭikoṭi yojanas above, where the celestial beings in the form of the moon, sun, planets, stars, and constellations reside.  Passing through the Saudharma, Aiśāna, Sanatkumāra, Mahendra, Brahmaloka, Lāntaka, Śukra, Sahasrāra, Pānat, Prānat, Prāraṇa, and Acyuta kalpas, and the three hundred and eighteen vimāna vāmas of the three gre veyakprastṭas, and going far beyond them, there are five great vimānas, called the five Anuttara (maha) vimānas, situated in the five directions, free from dust, pure, without darkness, and very large. They are as follows: 1. Vijay, 2. Vaijayanta, 3. Jayanta, 4. Aparājita, and 5. Sarvārthasiddha. These vimānas are completely made of jewels, clear like crystal, smooth, soft, polished, smooth, free from dust, pure, spotless, without any covering, shaded, radiant, prosperous, shining, pleasing, beautiful, and well-proportioned. There, the places of the Anuttaropapātika devas, both sufficient and insufficient, are said to be. These places are in the countless parts of the loka, according to the three expectations. There, many Anuttaropapātika devas reside. O venerable Śramaṇa! They are all equally endowed with riches, all equally strong, all equally influential, very happy, without Indra, without a messenger, and without a priest. These devas are called 'Ahamindra'. Discussion - The places of all the Dhaimānika devas are described in detail in the fifteen sūtras (sū. 196 to 210) presented here, from the ordinary vimānas to the special kalpopapannas like Saudharma, etc., and the nine gre veyakas and the five Anuttaropapātika kalpātita vimānas, their places, vimānas, their characteristics, the devas residing there, the Indras, the Ahamindras, etc. The total number of ordinary vimānas is 84,97,023, including the number of vimānas in the Saudharma, etc., special kalpopapannas, which are 32, 28, 12, 8, and 4 lakhs, respectively. The separate crown marks of the devas of the twelve kalpas are: 1. The Saudharma devas have a deer on their crown, 2. The Aiśāna devas have a buffalo on their crown, 3. The Sanatkumāra devas have a boar on their crown, 4. The Mahendra devas have a lion on their crown, 5. The Brahmaloka devas have a goat on their crown, 6. The Lāntaka devas have a frog on their crown, 7. The (maha) Śukradevas have a horse on their crown, 8. The Sahasrārakalpadevas have an elephant on their crown, 9. The Pānatkalpadevas have a snake on their crown, 10. The Prānatkalpadevas have a wild animal or a jackal on their crown, 11. The Āraṇakalpadevas have a bull on their crown, and 12. The Acyutakalpadevas have a 'viḍima' on their crown. Explanation of Sakkhi Sapḍidisī - Those whose sides, i.e., flanks, are the same in the east-west-north-south directions are called 'sap̣akṣa', i.e., those with the same direction, and those whose opposite directions and different directions are the same are called 'sapratiḍisa'.  / 2 1.

## Diagram of the Avatansakas of the 189 Second Kalpas

**Name of the Kalpa in the center | East | South | West | North**

| **Soudharma Kalpa** | **Soudharma Avatansaka** | **Ashoka Avatansaka** | **Saptaparna Avatansaka** | **Champaka Avatansaka** | **Chata Avatansaka** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| **(11) (Praran) Achyuta Kalpa** | **Achyuta Avatansaka** |  |  |  |  |

**'Anida'** -  Jina Devas who have no Indra (ruler), they are Anindra. 
**'Prapesssa'** - Those who have no servants or attendants, they are Apreṣya.
**'Apurohia'** - Those who have no priests to perform peace rituals, they are Apurohita, because these Kalpatita Devalokas do not experience any kind of disturbance.
**'Prahmida'** = 'Ahmindra', where everyone is their own Indra, they are called Ahmindra.

**Meaning:** In the twelve Kalpas, there is a distinction between master and servant, but this distinction does not exist among the Devas of the Nava-Aveyakas and Anuttara-Vimanas. All the Devas there have equal powers and abilities, therefore, they all experience themselves as Indra (independent). However, except for the Sarvartha-Siddha Vimanas, there may be a difference in their lifespan.

**211. "Bante! What is the location of the Siddhas? Bante! Where do the Siddhas reside?"**

**"Go-yama! Above the great Vimanas of the Samvatta-Siddhas, there is a place called Thubhi-Yaggamro, twelve Yojanas high. There, a place called Isip-Pabhara is the earth, extending for forty-two thousand Yojanas."**

## Second Stage [191]

**166.** The liberated ones, having attained Siddhahood, are beyond the reach of the cycle of births and deaths. They are free from the limitations of body, age, and death.

**167.** Just as there is one Siddha, so there are infinite liberators of the cycle of births and deaths. They are all equal, united, and together they shine brightly.

**168.** The Siddhas, who are established in the right faith, are praised by the liberated ones. They are countless in number and are praised by the liberated ones in all the realms and places.

**169.** The liberated ones, who are the masters of their own bodies, are the masters of their own senses and knowledge. They are like the ocean, the abode of all the treasures. This is the characteristic of the Siddhas.

**170.** The liberated ones, who are the masters of their own knowledge, know all the qualities and characteristics of all beings. They are free from all limitations and are infinite in their knowledge.

**171.** There is no happiness for humans or even for all the gods that is equal to the happiness of the Siddhas. This happiness is beyond all comparison.

**172.** Even the gods, who are full of happiness, who are powerful, who are worshipped, and who are full of virtues, cannot attain the happiness of liberation, even if they go from one heaven to another.

**173.** The happiness of the Siddha is a treasure that is beyond all comparison. It is infinite and is not limited by any space or time.

**174.** Just as a person who is full of desires, enjoys eating and drinking, but is not satisfied, so also a person who is full of desires, cannot be satisfied by any comparison.

**175.** The happiness of the Siddhas is beyond all comparison. There is no comparison for it. It is like the sound of a conch shell, which is unique and cannot be compared to anything else.

**176.** Just as a person who is full of desires, enjoys eating and drinking, but is not satisfied, so also a person who is free from desires, is like the ocean, which is limitless.

**177.** The Siddhas are free from all desires and are always happy. They are like the ocean, which is limitless and always full of water.

**178.** The Siddhas are called Buddhas, Paragaatas, and Paramparagaatas. They are free from all karmas, they are ageless and immortal, and they are always happy.

**179.** The Siddhas are free from all suffering, they are free from the bondage of birth, old age, and death, and they are always happy. They are like the ocean, which is limitless and always full of water.

**191.** The second stage of the liberation of the soul is complete.

[192] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra [211 pr.] Bhagavan! Where are the places of the Siddhas said to be? Bhagavan! Where do the Siddhas reside? [211 u.] Gautama! Above the upper stupa of the Sarvārthasiddha Mahāvimāna, twelve yojanas without obstruction, there is a land called Īṣatprāgabhārā, whose length and breadth is forty-five lakh yojanas. Its circumference is a little more than one crore forty-two lakh, thirty thousand, two hundred and ninety-four yojanas. In the very middle (in length and breadth) of the Īṣatprāgabhārā-earth, there is a region of eight yojanas, which is said to be eight yojanas thick (high). Thereafter (in all directions and vidishas), due to the gradual decrease of the regions, it becomes thinner and thinner, and finally it is said to be thinner than a fly's wing, as thick as an innumerable part of an angula. Twelve names have been given to the Īṣatprāgabhārā-earth. They are as follows: (1) Īṣat, (2) Īṣatprāgabhārā, (3) Tanu, (4) Tanu-tanu, (5) Siddhi, (6) Siddhalaya, (7) Mukti, (8) Muktālaya (9) Lokāgra, (10) Lokāgra-stūpikā, or (11) Lokāgraprativāhini (Bodhana) and (12) Sarvaprāṇa-bhūta-jīva-sattvasukhāvahā. The Īṣatprāgabhārā-earth is white, like the pure powder of conch shell, like the auspicious symbol, mṛṇāla, water drop, snow, cow's milk and garland, situated in the shape of an inverted umbrella, completely white like Arjuna gold, clear like crystal, smooth, soft, rubbed, smooth (mṛṣṭa), pure, spotless, without shadow (lustre), radiant, prosperous, luminous, pleasing, visible, beautiful and perfect (sarvāngasundara). From the Īṣatprāgabhārā-earth, the end of the world is one yojana away with a speed that cannot be measured. The upper part of that yojana, the sixth part of that upper part, is where the Siddha Bhagavans, who are free from sadi-ananta, many births, old age, death, yoni-samsara (movement), obstacles (kalankali bhavas), rebirth (punarbhava), dwelling in the form of a womb and from the world, reside eternally for all time to come. [Meaning of the verses on Siddhas] There (in the aforementioned Siddha-sthāna), they (Siddha Bhagavans) are also free from the Vedas, free from pain, free from ego, free from (external-internal) attachment, completely liberated from the world (birth-death) and have a form made of (ātma) regions. // 158 // Where do the Siddhas stop? Where are the Siddhas established (seated)? Where do they give up their bodies, where do they go and become Siddhas? ||156 // (Further) Due to the absence of the world, the Siddhas are stopped (pratihata) (in the world). They are established in the front part of the world (lokāgra) and here (in the human world) they give up their bodies and go there (in the front part of the world) and become Siddhas (nisthitārtha). // 160 // The third part less than the last birth's form (ākāra) is said to be the absorption of the Siddhas. // 161 //

Page #226:
---------------------------
The second place (body) at the time of abandoning this existence, at the last moment, was a dense institution (form) from the regions (as many as tribhāga-hīna), the same institution remains there (in the Lokān in the Siddha state), one should know. ||162|| (Those who had an excellent immersion of five hundred bows here, there) have an immersion of three hundred and thirty-three bows and one-third of a bow. / This is said to be the excellent immersion of the Siddhas. / / 163 // (Full) four ratnis (mund hath) and one ratni less by tribhāgan, this is said to be the medium immersion of the Siddhas, one should understand. / / 164 // One (full) ratni and eight angulas more, which is the immersion, this is said to be the lowest immersion of the Siddhas. / / 165 // The immersion of the Siddhas is less by tribhāga (less) from the (last) existence (charma sharīra). / The institution (form) of the Siddhas, who are completely free from old age and death, is anitthanstha. / That is, it cannot be said 'it is so'. // 166 / / / Where (in which region) there is one Siddha, there are infinite Siddhas who are liberated due to bhava-kshaya. / They are all in contact with the end (edge) of the Lok and are mutually samvagaḍha (completely contained in each other). / / 176 / / One Siddha regularly touches (remains in contact with) infinite Siddhas from all regions. / And those who are in contact with the countries and regions (being in contact), those Siddhas are (also) countless times more. / / 168 / / Siddha Bhagavan are bodiless, jīvadhana (having dense prātmā-pradeśa), and are suitable (always useful) in knowledge and vision; (because) the use of sākara (knowledge) and anākāra (vision) is the characteristic of the Siddhas. / / 166 / / Being suitable (useful) by kevalajñāna (always), they know all substances, their all qualities and paryāyas, and they see everything (all substances in all ways) by infinite kevaladarshana. / / 170 // The happiness that the Siddhas who have attained (upgata) avyābādha, is neither for (chakravarti etc.) humans, nor for (sarvārthasiddha-paryanta) all the gods. / / 171 / / If all the happiness of the gods is combined (collected or combined) with all time, then multiply it by infinity and classify it by infinite squares, even then it cannot attain (cannot equal) the happiness of liberation. // 172 / / If the amount of happiness (of every moment) of one Siddha is combined (collected) from all time, and divided (reduced) by infinite square roots, then that (divided = reduced) happiness will also be (so much that) it will not fit in the entire sky. / / 173 / /

---------------------------
[194] Just as a barbarian (non-Aryan) who knows many types of city qualities, is unable to describe them due to their unparalleled nature, [174] similarly, the happiness of the Siddhas is unparalleled. There is no comparison to it. Yet, I will describe some specific comparisons (similarities), listen. [175] Just as a man, after consuming food that is perfect in all qualities, becomes free from thirst and hunger, like one who is satiated with nectar, [176-177] similarly, the Siddha Bhagavans, who have attained the eternal, uninterrupted, and unparalleled (unmatched) Nirvana-bliss, are always happy. [178-179] They are liberated beings, Siddhas, Buddhas, accomplished, traditional, free from the armor of karma, ageless, immortal, and liberated. They have transcended all suffering. They are completely free from the bondage of birth, old age, and death, and experience uninterrupted and eternal bliss as Siddhas. [178-179]

**Discussion - Description of the place of the Siddhas, etc.** - In this present Sutra (Sutra 211) full of verses, the author has described the place of the Siddhas, its characteristics, its synonymous names, the qualities of the Siddhas, the bliss of immersion, and their characteristics, etc.

**Explanation of some synonyms for the Earth that is slightly elevated in the front** - (1) In short, it is called 'Ishat'. (2) It is called 'Ishatpraagbhara' because it is slightly tilted forward. (3) It is called 'Tanu' because it is thinner than the other Earths. (4) It is called 'Tanutanvi' because it is thinner than the wing of a well-known thin fly. (5) It is called 'Siddhi' because it is near the Siddha region. (6) It is also called 'Siddhalaya' because it is near the Siddha region. (7-8) Similarly, the names 'Mukti' and 'Muktalaya' are also meaningful. (6) It is called 'Lokan' because it is located in the front part of the Lokas. (10) It is also called 'Lokagrastoopika' because it is like a stupa at the front of the Lokas. (11) It is called 'Lokan-Prativahini' because going forward from the front of the Lokas stops, therefore, it is called 'Lokan-Prativahini'. (12) It is also called 'Sarva Praan-Bhoot-Jeev-Satvasukhavaha' because it is a land that is harmless to all beings, creatures, living beings, and entities.

**Explanation of some specific qualities of the Siddhas** - 'Sadiya Apjjavasita' = Sadi-Apayavasit-Anant. Every Siddha attains the Siddha state only after the complete destruction of all karmas. Therefore, Siddhas are 'Sadi' (having a beginning), but after attaining Siddhatva, it never ends, therefore, they are called 'Apayavasit' - 'Anant'. This specific quality refutes the belief of 'Anadishuddha' [man]. Due to the complete destruction of the afflictions of attachment, aversion, etc., of the Siddhas, their Siddhatva state does not fall, because the cause of fall is attachment, etc., which have been completely eradicated from them. Just as a seed, when burnt, does not produce a sprout, similarly, after the destruction of the worldly seed of attachment, aversion, etc., there is no return to the world and no experience of birth and death. Therefore, they are called 'Anegajaati-Jara-Maran-Joni-Sansar-Kalankali-Bhav-Punbhav-Gambhavasavasahi-Papंचsamatikata'. The meaning is clear.

'Aveda' = Siddha Bhagavans are beyond the female Veda, male Veda, and neuter Veda (desire). That is, due to the absence of a body, they do not have the material Veda, and they are not subject to the influence of the five poisons (ignorance, attachment, aversion, pride, and jealousy).

Page #228:
---------------------------
[Second Position] [195]  Since the absence of the feeling of pain also leads to the absence of the feeling of pain, they are called Pravedi. Due to the absence of the karma of Avedana-Sata and Asata-Vedaniya, they are free from pain. /  'Nimmama Prasanga Ya' - They are Nirmama and Prasanga because they are free from Mamatva and external and internal Sangha (attachment or possession). /  Sansaravippa-Mukka - They are completely free and detached from the world, they have risen above it. /  Padesa-Nivvattasanthana - The form that exists in Siddhas is not due to the physical body, because the body is completely absent there, therefore their form (shape) arises only from the Atma-Pradeshas. Samvakalatitta - They are satisfied for all time, that is, from the beginning to the end of time, because they have attained supreme satisfaction by being completely free from desire. /  'Atulan Sasayam Pravaabahm Vvanam Suham Patta = Siddha Bhagavan is Atul - incomparable - unique - eternal and without any obstruction (without any obstruction whatsoever) has attained the Nirvana (Moksha) related - happiness. 'Siddattiy' - Those who are bound by the eight types of karma, who have destroyed them by Dhyat-Bhasmokrata, are Siddhas. /  Generally, whatever is accomplished by karma, skill, knowledge, mantra, yoga, pagam, wealth, journey, intention, penance and karma-kshaya, is also called by that particular name, but here, instead of all these, 'Karma-kshaya-Siddha' is intended. /  The word 'Buddha' has been used to negate all the rest. The meaning of Buddha is that he himself has awakened the world, which is asleep in the sleep of ignorance, by giving them knowledge of the truth, and being omniscient and all-seeing, his nature is itself the form of knowledge. He has known the true nature of things or the principles of the universe by himself, through pure knowledge, without any preaching. Arhant Bhagavan is also a 'Buddha', therefore the adjective has been given. Paragata - Those who have crossed over from the world or from all purposes. /  Therefore, they are accomplished. /  To negate the Akram Siddhas, it is said here - 'Paramparagata' = Those who are traditional. That is, those who have become Siddhas by passing through the fourth, sixth, etc. Gunasthanas, as much as possible, from the tradition of knowledge, vision and character, or from falsehood. /  Amara = They are immortal because they are completely free from Payukarma. They are free from the bonds of birth, old age, death, etc., which are influenced by the body. Birth, old age, death, etc., are forms of suffering, and Siddhas have crossed over from all these sufferings. /  Therefore, it is said, 'Niththinna-Savva-Dukkha - Jati-Jara-Maran-Bandhano Vimukka'. /  The adjectives 'Asarira', 'Vvanamuvagaya', 'Ummukkakammakavacha', 'Savvakalatitta', etc., of Siddhas are well-known, their meanings are also clear. _ 'Aloae Padhihata Siddha' - Explanation - Siddha Bhagavan is obstructed (stopped) by Alok because Alok is in front of Lokagra. The cause of motion is Dharma-Astikaya. It is only in Lokakasha, not in Alokakasha. Therefore, as soon as Alokakasha begins, the motion of Siddhas is obstructed or stopped. Thus, they are obstructed due to the absence of Dharma-Astikaya and leave the human realm and reside in the front part (upper part) of the Lok, at the same time, with Asprushad-Gati. 13 1.

##  196]  /  In the *Prajñāpanā Sūtra*, the establishment of the Siddhas in their final existence - In their final existence, whatever the long (500 bows), short (two hands in measure) or medium (size) establishment (shape) of the Siddhas, in the state of Siddhahood, one-third less size (establishment) remains, because in the state of Siddhahood, the holes of the mouth, stomach, ears, etc. are also filled; the self-regions become dense.  /  The meaning is that before the abandonment of existence, due to the power of the third white meditation called *sūkṣmakriyā'pratipāti*, the holes of the mouth, stomach, etc. are filled, and the establishment that remains with one-third less, is the same establishment that remains in the state of Siddhahood. The understanding of the Siddhas - The Siddhas whose final existence in the last moment is 500 bows, their one-third less becomes 333 bows, this is the excellent understanding of the Siddhas.  /  There is a doubt in this regard, that the wife of the Jain history-famous Nābhīkulkar, Marudevi, became a Siddha. The establishment of Nābhīkulkar's body was 525 bows, and the same establishment was of Marudevi; because the previous statement is - 'The consolidation, establishment and height should be understood as the same as the Kulkaras'. Therefore, if one-third is reduced from the establishment of the body of Marudevi who attained Siddhahood, then it becomes 350 bows. In such a situation, how will it be consistent with the excellent establishment of 333 bows mentioned above? The solution to this is that it is possible that the establishment of Marudevi's body was slightly less than Nābhīrāja; because according to the statement, the establishment of women with excellent establishment is slightly less than the establishment of men with excellent establishment, in comparison to their respective times. If Marudevi's establishment is considered to be 500 bows, then there is no fault. In addition, Marudevi became a Siddha while sitting on an elephant's howdah, therefore her body was contracted at that time. Due to this, it is not possible to have more establishment. Thus, the excellent establishment of the Siddhas mentioned above does not contradict. The medium establishment of the Siddhas is four hands full and one hand less in division. In the *Āgama*, the beings with an establishment of seven hands are said to be Siddhas, from this point of view, this establishment is not medium but the lowest Siddha. The solution to this doubt is that the Siddhahood of the beings with an establishment of seven hands should be understood in comparison to the Tirthankara. Ordinary Kevalis also become Siddhas with less establishment than this. The establishment mentioned above is in comparison to the ordinary, not in comparison to the Tirthankaras. The lowest establishment of the Siddhas is one hand and a pā. This lowest establishment should be understood as that of Kūrmaputrā, etc., whose body establishment is two hands. The commentator has said - 'The excellent establishment is said in comparison to those with 500 bows, the medium establishment is said in comparison to those with a body of 10 hands, and the lowest establishment is said in comparison to those with a body of two hands, which is one-third less than their body'. The establishment of the Siddhas is indeterminate - The shape (establishment) of the Siddhas, who are free from old age and death, is indeterminate. Just as it cannot be said that this is like that, it is called indeterminate or indescribable. Due to the filling of the holes of the mouth, stomach, etc., the previous shape of the body of the Siddhas changes, due to this, the establishment of the Siddhas is called indeterminate, this is what the commentator has said. The statement in the *Āgama* that 'the Siddha soul is neither long nor short', etc. also becomes consistent.

[Second Position] [197] Therefore, the non-constancy of the institution of the Siddhas is due to the intention, not because of the influence of the form / because the Siddhas do not lack the institution alone. 'Where one Siddha resides, there are infinite Siddhas residing / they live together, because being non-material, the Siddhas do not face any obstacle in being included in each other. Just as Dharmaastikaya, Adharmaastikaya, Aakaashaastikaya are present in the world, merged into each other, in the same way, infinite Siddhas are present in the world, merged into each other in the same perfect field of merging. They all remain distinct from the Lokanta. By rule, infinite Siddhas remain distinct from all the regions of the soul. This means that there are infinite Siddhas who are completely merged into each other and whose touch is from the country-(a little) regions, there are countless times more Siddhas than them. Because the merging regions are countless. Siddhas, with their perfect knowledge, always use the perfect knowledge-vision of the appropriate-Siddha Bhagavan, therefore they know with perfect knowledge, not from the mind etc., because being pure soul-like, they are devoid of mind etc. Siddhas: How is the soul wealth? Siddhas are said to have dense soul regions, therefore it is said that before attaining the state of Siddha, in the last time of the thirteenth Gunasthan, their mouth, stomach etc. holes are filled with soul regions, they are not empty of soul regions anywhere / / / Prajnapanasutra: Second Position ends / 1.

This is the third chapter of the *Prajñāpanā Sūtra*, which has two names: 'Bahuvaktvyapad' and 'Alpबहुत्वपद'.  *The number of *tattvas* or substances is also considered. The Upanishads, from the perspective of Vedanta, state that there is only one *tattva* in the universe - 'Brahman', and the entire universe is its 'vivat' or 'parināma'. On the other hand, the Sānkhyas believe that there are many *jīvas* but only one *ajīva*.  *Buddhist philosophy believes in many 'chitta' and many 'rupa'. Jain philosophy, from the perspective of the six *dravya*, not only describes the number but also the relative difference, the *alpबहुत्व*.  *In other words, which is less, which is more, which is equal, or which is superior? This has been considered from many different perspectives.  *This chapter describes this.  _ It considers the *alpबहुत्व* of not only *jīvas* but also of *dravya* like *dharma*, *astikāya*, etc., through twenty-seven *dvāra* from direction, motion, senses, body, yoga, etc., to *mahāḍaṇḍaka*. The classification of *padagalaastikāya* is also considered. The *Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama* considers *alpबहुत्व* through fourteen *dvāra* like motion, etc.  *First (in Sūtra 213-224), the *alpबहुत्व* of *jīvas* in general, then of the five *sthāvara* like earth-body, etc., of the three *vikaleindriya*, of the *nairāyika*, of the *nairāyika* of the seven hells, of the *tiryachpañcendriya* *jīva*, of humans, of the *bhavanapati*, *vāṇavyantara*, *jyotiṣka*, and *vaimānika* gods, and also of the *siddha* is considered separately.  *Then, from Sūtra 225 to 275, the *alpबहुत्व* of the four *gati* like hell, etc., of *jīva* with and without senses, of *paryāptak* and *aparyāptak*, of *ṣaṭkāyika* and *akāyika*, of *aparyāptakparyāptak*, of *paryāptak* and *aparyāptak*, of *bādar* and *sūkṣmaṣaṭkāyika*, of *sayogi*, *manoyogi*, *vacanayogi*, *kāyayogi*, and *ayogi*, of *savadaka*, *strīvedaka*, *puruṣavedaka*, *napumsakavedaka*, and *avedaka*, of *sakṣāyī*, *krodha*, etc., is considered through the twenty-third *dvāra*.

200] [From the Prajñāpanā, while in the Ūrvaloca the order is reversed, there the number of the highest Anuttara Vimānavasī Devas is the least, then the number of the lower Devas increases progressively, with the number of Saudharma Devas being the highest / But below the Manushya Loca are the Bhavanapati Devas, their number is greater than the Saudharma, even though they are higher, the number of Vyantara and Jyotishka Devas increases progressively. The least number is of humans, for this reason, human birth is considered rare / As the senses decrease, the number of beings increases, that is, the number of undeveloped beings is greater than that of developed beings. The number of Siddha (perfected) beings is less than that of Ekaindriya beings.

[Third Multi-Statement Difficulty] 207 224, with respect to directions, the least number of Siddhas are in the south and north directions / in the east, they are numerous, and in the west, they are more numerous / First Gate // 1 // [224] With respect to directions, the least number of Siddhas are in the south and north directions / in the east, they are numerous, and in the west, they are more numerous / First Gate // 1 // 

Discussion of the First Gate of Directions: In the first Sutra of the twelve Sutras (Sutras 213 to 224) presented here, the least number of Siddhas with respect to directions is discussed. The remaining 11 Sutras discuss the least number of beings from the Earth-bodied one-sense beings to the Uttara-Vimana-dwelling Vimana Devas. 

With respect to directions: In the first Shruta Skandha of the Acharanga, many types of Dravya-disha and Bhava-disha are mentioned, but here only the Kshetra-disha are considered, because other directions are not useful here and are often uncertain. 

The origin (Prabhava) of the Kshetra-disha is from the eight Ruchak-pradeshas located in the middle of the Tiryanch-loka. This is the center of all directions. 

The least number of Siddhas with respect to directions: The least number of Siddhas are in the west direction, because there is a scarcity of clouds and vegetation in that direction. Here, the least number is considered with respect to cloud beings, not with respect to subtle beings, because subtle beings are present everywhere in the entire loka and are almost equal everywhere. Among cloud beings, the most numerous are the plant-bodied beings. In a situation where there is more vegetation, there are more beings, and where there is a scarcity of vegetation, there are fewer beings. 

Vegetation is more abundant where there is an abundance of water. According to the saying, "Jattha Jalam Tattha Varna," where there is water, there is definitely vegetation, such as algae and seaweed. Even though algae and seaweed are counted as cloud vegetation due to the rise of the cloud karma, they are not visible to the eye because they are very subtle and remain in a condensed form. According to the saying, "Where there is water, there are plant-bodied beings," there is abundant water in the ocean, etc., and the oceans are twice as wide as the islands. Even in those oceans, there are Chandra-dvipa and Surya-dvipa in the east and west respectively. In the area where Chandra-Surya-dvipa are located, there is a lack of water. Where there is a lack of water, there is a lack of plant-bodied beings. In addition, in the west direction, there is the Gautama-dvipa, which is the abode of the Dev named Sasthita, who is the lord of the salt ocean. This Gautama-dvipa is even wider than the salt ocean. There is also a lack of water there, so there is a lack of plant-bodied beings. For this reason, the fewest beings are found in the west direction. 

There are more beings in the east direction than in the west direction, because there is no Gautama-dvipa in the east direction, so there are more beings there. There are more beings in the south direction than in the east direction, because there is abundant water in the south direction due to the absence of Chandra-Surya-dvipa, so there are many plant-bodied beings. There are more beings in the north direction than in the south direction, because in the north direction, there is a Manas-sarovar, which is as long and wide as a koti-yojana, in one of the islands that are as many yojanas as there are numbers. There is an abundance of water in this Manas-sarovar, so there is an abundance of plant-bodied beings. In the same way, there are many two-sense beings, such as conch shells, which are dependent on water, and ants, which are dependent on conch shells, etc., which are born on the shores of the ocean.

## Translation:

**208] The three-sensed beings like *Prajnapana Sutra* (ants), etc., the four-sensed beings like *bhramara* (bumblebees), etc., residing in lotus, etc., and the five-sensed beings like *matsya* (fish), etc., are also more abundant in the north.**

**Specifically, the abundance of beings in different directions is as follows:**

**(1) Abundance of Earth-bodied beings:**

* **Least abundant in the south:** Earth-bodied beings are least abundant in the south because they are more abundant where there is solid ground, and less abundant where there are holes or cavities. There are many buildings and *narakavasa* (hells) in the south, leading to an abundance of holes and cavities.
* **More abundant in the north:** Earth-bodied beings are more abundant in the north compared to the south because there are fewer buildings and *narakavasa* in the north. Therefore, there is more solid ground.
* **More abundant in the east:** Earth-bodied beings are more abundant in the east due to the presence of the *Chandra-Surya-Dweep* (Moon-Sun Island).
* **Most abundant in the west:** Earth-bodied beings are most abundant in the west because, in addition to the *Chandra-Surya-Dweep*, there is also the *Lavana-Samudriya-Gautama-Dweep* (Salt-Sea-Gautama Island).

**(2) Abundance of Water-bodied beings:**

* **Least abundant in the west:** Water-bodied beings are least abundant in the west because there is less water due to the presence of the *Gautama-Dweep*.
* **More abundant in the east:** Water-bodied beings are more abundant in the east because there is no *Gautama-Dweep*.
* **More abundant in the south:** Water-bodied beings are more abundant in the south because there is no *Chandra-Surya-Dweep*.
* **Most abundant in the north:** Water-bodied beings are most abundant in the north because of the abundance of water due to the presence of *Manasarovar* (Lake Manasarovar).

**(3) Abundance of Fire-bodied beings:**

* **Least abundant in the south and north:** Fire-bodied beings are least abundant in the south and north because they only exist in the *Manushya-Kshetra* (Human Realm), and not elsewhere. Even within the *Manushya-Kshetra*, they are more abundant where there is a higher population of humans, as the digestive process leads to an increase in fire-bodied beings.
* **Less abundant in the south and north:** Fire-bodied beings are less abundant in the south and north because there are fewer *Bharat-Kshetra* (Bharat Realms) in the south and fewer *Airavata-Kshetra* (Airavata Realms) in the north, leading to a smaller human population.
* **More abundant in the east:** Fire-bodied beings are more abundant in the east because there are more *Kshetra* (Realms) in the east.
* **Most abundant in the west:** Fire-bodied beings are most abundant in the west because there are *Adholaukik-Gram* (Subterranean Villages) in the west, where there is a large human population.

**(4) Abundance of Air-bodied beings:**

* **Least abundant in the east:** Air-bodied beings are least abundant in the east because air circulates where there are holes or cavities, not in solid ground. There is more solid ground in the east, leading to less air.
* **More abundant in the west:** Air-bodied beings are more abundant in the west compared to the east because there are *Adholaukik-Gram* (Subterranean Villages) in the west.
* **More abundant in the north:** Air-bodied beings are more abundant in the north because there are more *narakavasa* (hells) in the north, leading to more holes or cavities.
* **Most abundant in the south:** Air-bodied beings are most abundant in the south because there are more buildings and *narakavasa* (hells) in the south, leading to more holes or cavities.

**(5) Abundance of Plant-bodied beings:**

* **Least abundant in the west:** Plant-bodied beings are least abundant in the west because:
    * There is less water due to the presence of the *Gautama-Dweep*.
    * There is less solid ground due to the presence of the *Lavana-Samudriya-Gautama-Dweep* (Salt-Sea-Gautama Island).

## Third Multi-Statement Difficulty [209]

**Due to the presence of the Gautama Island, there is a scarcity of water, and due to the scarcity of water, the plant-bodied beings are also less. Plant-bodied beings are more abundant in the east than in the west, because there is more water in the east due to the absence of the Gautama Island. They are more abundant in the south than in the east, because there is an abundance of water due to the absence of the Chandra-Surya Island. (6) The scarcity of two-sensed beings - The fewest two-sensed beings are in the west, because there is less water due to the presence of the Gautama Island, and due to the scarcity of water, there are fewer conch-like two-sensed beings. They are more abundant in the east, because there is an abundance of water due to the absence of the Gautama Island, and therefore there are more conch-like two-sensed beings. They are even more abundant in the south, because there is more water due to the absence of the Chandra-Surya Island, and therefore there are more conch-like beings. In the north, there is an abundance of water due to the presence of the Manasarovar, therefore two-sensed beings are more abundant there. (7) The scarcity of three-sensed beings - Earthworm, ant, etc., three-sensed beings are dependent on the abundance of water, like the conch-like beings, due to their being subordinate to them. Therefore, the solution to their scarcity should also be understood in the same way as that of the two-sensed beings. (8) The scarcity of four-sensed beings - Bumblebees, etc., four-sensed beings are also mostly dependent on lotus, etc., and lotus (aquatic) being water-born, the scarcity and abundance of four-sensed beings also depends on the scarcity and abundance of water. Therefore, the explanation of their scarcity should also be understood in the same way as that of the two-sensed beings. (8) The scarcity of hell beings - There are the fewest hell beings in the east, west, and north, because there are fewer Pushpavakirna hell realms in these directions, and they are mostly limited in extent. There are countless times more hell beings in the south than in these directions, because there is an abundance of Pushpavakirna hell realms in the south, and they are mostly countless yojanas in extent. In addition, the birth of Krishnapakshika beings is very high in the south. There are two types of beings in the world - Krishnapakshika and Shuklapakshika. Those whose world (cycle of birth and death) is only a little less than half the pudgala transformation are Shuklapakshika, and those whose world (cycle of birth and death) is much more than that are Krishnapakshika. Shuklapakshika (limited-world) beings are few, while Krishnapakshika beings are very numerous. These cruel-acting and long-world-wandering beings are naturally born in the south. Mostly, cruel-acting, bhavasiddhika beings are also born in the places of hell beings, animals, humans, and asuras, etc., located in the south. (10) The scarcity of Ratnaprabha, etc., hell beings - Hell beings from the first hell realm called Ratnaprabha to the seventh hell realm called Tamas-Tamas-Prabha are the fewest in the east, west, and north, but they are countless times more in the south. The reason for this has been explained earlier. (11) The mutual scarcity of beings in the seven hell realms - Hell beings in the east, west, and north of the seventh hell earth are countless times fewer than the hell beings in the south of this earth. The reason for this has been explained earlier. Hell beings in the east, north, and west of the sixth hell earth (Tamas-Prabha) are countless times more than the hell beings in the south of the seventh hell earth. The reason for this is that the most sinful, conscious, five-sensed animals and humans in the world are in the seventh...**

**210]** **[Prajñāpanā Sūtra]** Those born in the Naraka-Pṛthvī are born in the sixth, fifth, and other lower Pṛthvīs, being slightly inferior, inferior, and sinful. The most excellent sinners are the fewest. Therefore, there are the fewest Narakas in the south of the seventh Naraka-Pṛthvī. The Narakas in the east, west, and north of the sixth Naraka-Pṛthvī are countless times more than those in the south. The Narakas in the east, west, and north of the sixth Naraka-Pṛthvī are countless times more than those in the south. The reason has been explained before. From there, the Narakas in the east, west, and north of the fifth, fourth, third, second, and first Narakas, as well as those in the south, should be understood to be countless times more in sequence. (12) The small number of Tiryañc-pañcendriya beings should be understood like the Apkāyika Sūtra. (13) The small number of humans - the fewest humans are in the south and north, because the five Bharat and five Airavata regions in these directions are small. There are countless times more in the east, because the regions there are countless times larger. There are even more in the west, because there are Adholaukika villages, which naturally have a large number of humans. (14) The small number of Bhavanavāsī Devas - the fewest Bhavanavāsī Devas are in the east and west, because there are few Bhavanas in both these directions. There are countless times more in the north, because there are many Bhavanas there due to it being their Svasthāna. There are countless times more in the south, because there are four lakh Bhavanas more in each Nikāya, and many Kṛṣṇapākṣika are born in this direction, therefore they are countless times more. (15) The small number of Vāṇavyantara Devas - where there are Pole places, there is usually the movement of Vyantaras. There are more solid places in the east, therefore there are fewer Vyantaras there. There are more in the west, because there are more Poles in the Adholaukika villages. There are more in the north, because there is a large number of Nagravāsas due to it being their Svasthāna. There are more in the south than in the north, because there are many Nagravāsas in the south. (16) The small number of Jyotiṣka Devas - the fewest Jyotiṣka Devas are in the east and west, because there are few Jyotiṣka Devas in the islands like the gardens of the Moon and Sun in both these directions. There are more in the south, because there are more Vimānas in the south, and Kṛṣṇapākṣika are only in the south. There are even more in the north, because there are many Kṛḍāsthala of Jyotiṣka Devas in Manasarovara in the north. Due to being engaged in Kṛḍā, Jyotiṣka Devas always stay there. The Matsya and other aquatic creatures of Manasarovara, seeing the Vimānas near them, develop Jātismaraṇajñāna, which causes them to adopt some Vrata, give up food, etc., and are born there due to Nidāna. Therefore, there are more Jyotiṣka Devas in the north than in the south. (17) The small number of Saudharma-prādi Vaimānika Devas - the fewest Vaimānika Devas in the Saudharmakalpa are in the east and west, because the Prāvalikāpraviṣṭa Vimānas are the same in all four directions, but the Bahasankhyaka and Asankhyātayogana-vistṛta Puṣpāvakīrṇa Vimānas are only in the south and north, not in the east and west. Therefore, there are the fewest Vaimānika Devas in the east and west. There are countless times more in the north, because there are many Asankhyātayogana-vistṛta Puṣpāvakīrṇa Vimānas in the north.

**Third Multiplicity of the Multiplicity of Statements**

[211] And they are even more special, because most of the Krishnapaksha (dark fortnight) beings go there. The gods of the Ishana, Sanatkumar and Mahendra kalpas are also few in number compared to the directions, and their reason should be understood as before. The gods of the Brahmaloka kalpa are the fewest in the east, west and north directions, because: most of the Krishnapaksha beings are born in the south direction and the Shuklapaksha (bright fortnight) beings are few. There are countless times more gods in the south direction than in the other directions, because many Krishnapaksha beings are born there. / Similarly, the fewness and reason of the gods of the Lantaka, Mahashukra and Sahasrar kalpas (compared to the directions) should be understood as before. / After the Sahasrar kalpa, the gods of the higher kalpas and the nine Graveyaka and five Anuttara Vimanas are equal in all directions, because only humans are born there. (18)

**Fewness of Siddha Jivas**

The fewest Siddhas are in the south and north, because only humans become Siddhas, not other beings. The humans who become Siddhas are located in the celestial regions where they are immersed (situated) at the end of time, and they go up in the direction of those celestial regions. Going straight up, they become situated in the Lokagna (fire of the world). / There are few humans in the five Bharat Kshetras in the south and the five Airavata Kshetras in the north, because the Siddha Kshetra is small. Then, Siddhi is not attained in the Sushama-Sushama etc. Praras. / Therefore, there are the fewest Siddhas in the south and north. There are countless times more in the east, because the East Videha is countless times wider than the Bharat and Airavata Kshetras, so there are countless times more humans there, and Siddhi is attained there all the time. There are even more in the west, because there are more humans in the Adholaukik (lower world) villages.

**13. (And from them) Sa-indriya (all-sense) beings are more abundant.**

**||3||**

**Discussion - Third Indriya-dvāra: The Relative Scarcity of Beings Based on Senses:**

These five sūtras (227 to 231) discuss the relative abundance of beings from Sa-indriya (all-sense), Ani-indriya (no-sense), and Eka-indriya (one-sense) to Panch-indriya (five-sense) beings, from various perspectives.

**(1) Relative Abundance of Sa-indriya, Ani-indriya, and Eka-indriya to Panch-indriya Beings:**

The least abundant are Panch-indriya (five-sense) beings (hell, animal, human, and god), as they are equal in number to the countless parts of an immeasurable space, measured by the diameter of a koti-koti-yojana (a unit of distance). 
More abundant than them are Chatur-indriya (four-sense) beings like bees, as they are equal in number to a vast koti-koti-yojana diameter. 
More abundant than them are Tri-indriya (three-sense) beings like ants, as they are equal in number to a vast koti-koti-yojana diameter. 
More abundant than them are Dvi-indriya (two-sense) beings like conch shells, as they are equal in number to a vast koti-koti-yojana diameter. 
Ani-indriya (no-sense) beings (Siddhās) are infinitely more abundant than Dvi-indriya beings, as they are infinite. 
Eka-indriya (one-sense) beings are infinitely more abundant than Ani-indriya beings, as plant-like beings alone are infinitely more abundant than Siddhās. 
Sa-indriya (all-sense) beings are more abundant than Eka-indriya beings, as they encompass all beings with two or more senses. 
This is the relative abundance of beings in general.

**(2) Relative Abundance of Beings with Insufficient Karma:**

Panch-indriya beings with insufficient karma are the least abundant, as they are equal in number to the countless parts of a finger in one pratar (a unit of time). 
Chatur-indriya beings with insufficient karma are more abundant than them, as they are equal in number to the countless parts of a finger in a vast pratar. 
Tri-indriya beings with insufficient karma are more abundant than them, as they are equal in number to the countless parts of a finger in a vast pratar. 
Dvi-indriya beings with insufficient karma are more abundant than them, as they are equal in number to the countless parts of a finger in a vast pratar. 
Eka-indriya beings with insufficient karma are infinitely more abundant than them, as plant-like beings with insufficient karma are always infinite. 
Sa-indriya beings with insufficient karma are more abundant than them, as they encompass all beings with one or more senses.

**(3) Relative Abundance of Beings with Sufficient Karma:**

Chatur-indriya beings with sufficient karma are the least abundant, as their lifespan is very short, and they are not found in large numbers at the time of the question. 
Panch-indriya beings with sufficient karma are more abundant than them, as they are equal in number to the countless parts of a finger in a vast pratar. 
Dvi-indriya beings with sufficient karma are more abundant than them, as they are equal in number to the countless parts of a finger in a vast pratar. 
Tri-indriya beings with sufficient karma are more abundant than them, as they are naturally equal in number to the countless parts of a finger in a vast pratar. 
Eka-indriya beings with sufficient karma are infinitely more abundant than them, as plant-like beings are infinite. 
Sa-indriya beings with sufficient karma are more abundant than them, as they encompass all beings with two or more senses.

## Third Multiplicity of Abundance [217 (4)]

The least abundant among the sense-endowed and non-sense-endowed beings are the non-sense-endowed beings with the least number of senses, because the subtle one-sensed beings are very numerous due to their pervasiveness in all realms, but among them, the non-sense-endowed are the least. Compared to them, the sense-endowed are many times more numerous. Similarly, the one-sensed non-sense-endowed are the least, and the sense-endowed are many times more numerous than them. Among the two-sensed beings, the sense-endowed are the least, because they are only as numerous as the parts of a finger, while the two-sensed non-sense-endowed are as numerous as the parts of a finger multiplied by an infinite number. After this, in the three-sensed, four-sensed, and five-sensed beings, the sense-endowed are the least in each, and the non-sense-endowed are infinitely more numerous than them. The reason for this should be understood as before.

[217 (5)] In the aggregate, the least abundant among the sense-endowed and other aggregated sense-endowed and non-sense-endowed beings are the four-sensed sense-endowed, as explained earlier. The five-sensed sense-endowed, the two-sensed sense-endowed, and the three-sensed sense-endowed are progressively more numerous than them. The five-sensed non-sense-endowed, the four-sensed non-sense-endowed, the three-sensed non-sense-endowed, and the two-sensed non-sense-endowed are progressively infinitely more numerous, more numerous, more numerous, and more numerous than them. Further, the one-sensed non-sense-endowed are infinitely more numerous than them, the one-sensed sense-endowed are many times more numerous, the sense-endowed are more numerous, and the sense-endowed beings are even more numerous than them. The reason for their least abundance should be understood as before.

## Third Multi-Statement Difficulty [221 Discussion - Fourth Body Gate: In relation to the body, the scarcity of Sakayika, Prakayika and Shatkayika beings is presented in five sutras (Su. 232 to 236). In relation to the body, the scarcity of Shatkayika, Sakayika, and Akayika beings in their collective form, their inadequacies and adequacies, and individually and collectively, the scarcity of adequate and inadequate beings is established. (1) Scarcity of Shatkayika, Sakayika, Prakayika beings - The fewest are Triskayika, because Triskayika include beings from two-sense to five-sense, they are fewer than other bodies (earth body etc.). They are outnumbered by Tejaskaika by an immeasurable amount, because they are immeasurable in the number of Lokakasha-Pradesh-Praman. They are outnumbered by Prithvikaika by a special amount, because they are abundant and immeasurable in the number of Lokakasha-Pradesh-Praman. They are outnumbered by Apkayika by a special amount, because they are more abundant and immeasurable in the number of Lokakasha-Pradesh-Praman. They are outnumbered by Vayukaika by a special amount, because they are most abundant and immeasurable in the number of Lokakasha-Pradesh-Praman. Compared to them, Akayika (Siddh Bhagavan) are infinite times more, because Siddha beings are infinite. They are outnumbered by Vanaspatikaika by an infinite amount, because they are infinite in the number of Lokakasha-Pradesh-Rashi-Praman. They are also outnumbered by Sakayika by a special amount, because they include all beings with bodies, including earth body etc. (2) Scarcity of Sakayika etc. inadequacies - Among them, the fewest are Triskayika inadequacies, and from there, they are outnumbered by Sakayika inadequacies in a special amount. The explanation of scarcity up to this point should be understood as before. (3) Scarcity of Sakayika etc. adequacies - Their scarcity should also be understood by the same logic as before. (4) Scarcity of Sakayika etc. individual adequacies and inadequacies - The fewest are Sakayika inadequacies. They are outnumbered by Sakayika adequacies by a countable amount. Similarly, all the following seven chapters are easy. In all of these, inadequacies are the fewest, and compared to them, adequacies are countable times more. The reason for this is that inadequacies are produced by the support of adequacies. That is, adequacies are the foundation of inadequacies. (5) Scarcity of Sakayika etc. collective adequacies and inadequacies - Among them, the fewest are Triskayika adequacies. They are outnumbered by Triskayika inadequacies by an immeasurable amount, because inadequate two-sense etc. are immeasurable times more than adequate two-sense etc. They are outnumbered by Tejaskaika inadequacies by an immeasurable amount, because they are immeasurable in the number of Lokakasha-Pradesh-Praman. They are outnumbered by Prithvikaika, Apkayika and Vayukaika inadequacies in a special amount respectively. Due to the abundance of Prithvikaika inadequacies, they are more than Tejaskaika inadequacies. They are outnumbered by Apkayika inadequacies by a lot, so they are in a special amount. They are outnumbered by Vayukaika inadequacies by the aforementioned logic in a special amount. They are outnumbered by Prithvikaika, Apkayika and Vayukaika adequacies in a special amount respectively, because adequacies are in a special amount compared to inadequacies. Previously, Vanaspatikaika inadequacies are infinite times more than adequacies, and Sakayika adequacies are countable times more than them. The reason for this has been explained before. Although this sutra (Su. 236) has 15 points of scarcity, which are mentioned in other copies, the Vrittikar has only mentioned 12 points in the Prajnapanavritti. Therefore, 1. Prajnapana. Malaya.

## Third Multi-Statement Difficulty [237]

1. **The Small Number of Subtle Beings in the Aggregate:** The most subtle are the subtle *tejaskayika* beings, they are equal to countless *lokaakasha* regions. Compared to them, the subtle *prithvikaayika* beings are more numerous, as they are equal to abundant countless *lokaakasha* regions. Compared to them, the subtle *apkayika* beings are more numerous, as they are equal to even more abundant countless *lokaakasha* regions. Compared to them, the subtle *vayukaayika* beings are more numerous, as they are equal to the most abundant countless *lokaakasha* regions. Compared to them, the subtle *nigoda* beings are countless times more numerous. / Those beings who reside in the shelter of a single body are called *nigoda* beings. *Nigoda* beings are of two types: subtle and dense. / Dense *nigoda* beings are found in *sūraṇakanda* etc., while subtle *nigoda* beings are spread throughout all the realms. They are countless in each and every sphere. / Therefore, they are countless times more numerous than the *vayukaayika* beings. Compared to them, the subtle *vanaspatikaayika* beings are infinitely more numerous, as there are infinite beings in each *nigoda*. Compared to them, the general subtle beings are more numerous, as the subtle *prithvikaayika* etc. are also included in them.

2. **The Small Number of Subtle Insufficient Beings:** The small number of subtle insufficient beings should also be understood in the same order as mentioned above.

3. **The Small Number of Subtle Sufficient Beings:** The order of their small number is also the same as before.

4. **The Separate Small Number of Sufficient and Insufficient Beings from Subtle to Subtle *Nigoda*:** In the small number of each of these, the subtle insufficient beings are the least, and the subtle sufficient beings are countless times more numerous than them. Among subtle beings, sufficient beings are more long-lasting than insufficient beings. Therefore, they are always found in greater numbers.

5. **The Small Number of Subtle Sufficient and Insufficient Beings in Aggregate:** The most subtle are the subtle *tejaskayika* insufficient beings, the reason for which has been explained before. Compared to them, the subtle *prithvikaayika* insufficient, subtle *apkayika* insufficient, and subtle *vayukaayika* insufficient beings are slightly more numerous; the meaning of slightly more numerous is not double or triple. The reason for their slight increase in number has been explained before. Compared to them (subtle *vayukaayika* insufficient beings), the subtle *tejaskayika* sufficient beings are countless times more numerous, as sufficient beings are countless times more numerous than insufficient beings, as explained before. Therefore, compared to them, the subtle *prithvikaayika* sufficient, subtle *apkayika* sufficient, and subtle *vayukaayika* sufficient beings are slightly more numerous. Compared to them, the subtle *nigoda* insufficient beings are countless times more numerous, as they are extremely abundant in number. Compared to them, the subtle *nigoda* sufficient beings are countless times more numerous, as sufficient beings are generally countless times more numerous than insufficient beings among subtle beings. Compared to them, the subtle *vanaspatikaayika* insufficient beings are infinitely more numerous, as they are infinite in each *nigoda*. Compared to them, the general subtle insufficient beings are slightly more numerous, as the subtle *prithvikaayika* etc. are also included in them. Compared to them, the subtle *vanaspatikaayika* sufficient beings are countless times more numerous, the reason for which has been explained before. Compared to them, the subtle sufficient beings are slightly more numerous, as the subtle *prithvikaayika* etc. sufficient beings are also included in them. Compared to them, the subtle beings are slightly more numerous, as they include all the subtle sufficient and insufficient beings. Thus, there are five principles related to subtle beings. Now, the five principles related to dense beings are as follows:

6. **The Small Number of Dense Beings in the Aggregate:** The least numerous are the dense *traskayika* beings, as only the two-sense beings etc. are dense *traskayika*, and they are fewer than the other bodies. Compared to them, the dense *tejaskayika* beings are countless times more numerous.

---------------------------
[238]. [The Prajñāpanā Sūtra are countless, as vast as the space of countless worlds. Each body is countless times more numerous than the Bādar Vanaṣpatīkāyika, because the Bādar Tejas Kāyika are only found in the human realm, while the realm of each body is countless times greater than that of the Bādar Vanaṣpatīkāyika. The second section of the Prajñāpanā Sūtra states that in the proper place, there are 7 Ghanoḍadhi, 7 Ghanoḍadhivalaya, and similarly in the lower, upper, and oblique realms, wherever there are reservoirs, there are places for the Bādar Vanaṣpatīkāyika. Where there are places for the Bādar Vanaṣpatīkāyika, there are also places for their non-sufficient counterparts. Therefore, since the realm is countless times greater, they are also countless times more numerous. The Bādar Nigoda are countless times more numerous than them, because they are extremely subtle and are found everywhere in water in the form of algae, etc. The Bādar Pṛthvīkāyika are countless times more numerous than them, because they exist in all eight earths, as well as in the planes, buildings, and mountains, etc. The Bādar Apkāyika are infinitely more numerous than them, because there is an abundance of water in the oceans. The Bādar Vāyukāyika are countless times more numerous than them, because air is present in all porous places. The Bādar Vanaṣpatīkāyika are infinitely more numerous than them, because there are infinite beings in the Bādar Nigoda. The Bādar Jīva are more numerous than them, because they include all beings, from the Bādar Dwīndriya, etc. 7-8. The Bādar Aparyāptakas and Paryāptakas are few in number - the order of the Bādar Jīva's Aparyāptakas and Paryāptakas is also similar to the previous Sūtra (Sū. 242). The Bādar Paryāptakas are only different in the beginning - there, the Bādar Tejas Kāyika Paryāptakas are the least numerous, instead of the Bādar Tras Kāyika Aparyāptakas. The rest is the same as before. The explanation of their scarcity should also be understood as before. 6. The Bādar Paryāptakas and Aparyāptakas are few in number - countless Bādar Aparyāptakas are born dependent on each Bādar Paryāptakas in the Bādar Jīva. By this rule, the Aparyāptakas are countless times more numerous than the Paryāptakas in the Bādar Jīva, Bādar Pṛthvīkāyika, etc. 10. The Bādar, Bādar Pṛthvīkāyika, etc. Paryāptakas and Aparyāptakas are few in number - the Bādar Tejas Kāyika Paryāptakas are the least numerous, the Bādar Sakāyika Paryāptakas are countless times more numerous than them, the Bādar Tras Kāyika Aparyāptakas, the Bādar Pratiyaka Vanaṣpatīkāyika Paryāptakas, the Bādar Nigoda Paryāptakas, the Bādar Pṛthvīkāyika Paryāptakas, the Bādar Apkāyika Paryāptakas, and the Bādar Vāyukāyika Paryāptakas are successively countless times more numerous. Their scarcity should be understood from the above mentioned reasons. The Bādar Vanaṣpatīkāyika Paryāptakas are infinitely more numerous than them, because they are infinite in each Bādar Nigoda. The collective Bādar Paryāptakas are more numerous than them, because they include all of them, from the Bādar Tejas Kāyika, etc. The Bādar Vanaṣpatīkāyika Aparyāptakas are countless times more numerous than the Bādar Paryāptakas, and the Bādar Aparyāptakas and Bādar are successively more numerous than them, the reason for this should be understood as before. 11. The scarcity of the subtle Bādar in the collective - (according to Sū. 247) the Bādar Tras Kāyika are the least numerous, followed by the Bādar Vāyukāyika, the scarcity of the Bādar Raga Vikalpas should be understood as before. Thereafter, the scarcity of the subtle Vikalpas up to the subtle Nigoda should also be known as before. After that, the Bādar Vanaṣpatīkāyika are infinitely more numerous, because there are infinite beings in each Bādar Nigoda. The Bādar Aparyāptakas are more numerous than them, because they also include the Bādar Tejas Kāyika, etc.

**Third Multi-Statement Difficulty** [239]

* **Inclusion:** They include countless subtle plant-bodied beings; because there are countless subtle nigodas from the coarse nigodas. Generally, subtle beings are more numerous than coarse beings, because subtle beings like subtle luminous-bodied beings are also included in them.
* **12-13. The relative abundance of coarse-bodied beings and their deficiencies (according to Sutra 248):** The least abundant among the deficient beings is the coarse tremor-bodied deficient being.
* **After that, the coarse luminous-bodied, each-body plant-bodied, coarse nigoda, coarse earth-bodied, coarse water-bodied, coarse air-bodied deficient beings are successively countless times more abundant.** This should be understood like the second deficient-sutra.
* **There are countless subtle luminous-bodied deficient beings from the coarse air-bodied deficient beings, because they are equal to countless regions of the universe.** From them, the subtle earth-bodied, subtle water-bodied, subtle air-bodied, subtle nigoda deficient beings are successively countless times more abundant. This should be understood like the second sutra in the subtle five sutras.
* **There are countless plant-bodied deficient beings from the subtle nigoda deficient beings, because there are countless beings in each coarse nigoda.** Generally, coarse deficient beings are more numerous than subtle deficient beings, because coarse tremor-bodied deficient beings are also included in them.
* **There are countless subtle plant-bodied deficient beings from the coarse nigoda deficient beings, because there are countless subtle nigoda deficient beings from the coarse nigoda deficient beings.** Generally, subtle deficient beings are more numerous than coarse deficient beings, because subtle luminous-bodied deficient beings are also included in them.
* **Abundant beings (according to Sutra 246):** The coarse luminous-bodied abundant beings are the least abundant. After that, the coarse tremor-bodied, coarse each-body plant-bodied, coarse nigoda, coarse earth-bodied, coarse water-bodied, and coarse air-bodied abundant beings are successively countless times more abundant, because the coarse air-bodied beings are as numerous as countless regions of the universe.
* **After that, the subtle earth-bodied, subtle water-bodied, subtle air-bodied abundant beings are successively more numerous.**
* **There are countless subtle nigoda abundant beings from the subtle air-bodied abundant beings, because they are very abundant and exist in every sphere.** There are countless plant-bodied abundant beings from them, because there are countless beings in each coarse nigoda. Generally, subtle abundant beings are more numerous than coarse abundant beings, because subtle luminous-bodied beings and other abundant beings are also included in them.
* **14. The relative abundance of subtle coarse abundant and deficient beings (according to Sutra 250):** The least abundant are the coarse abundant beings, because they are limited in area. There are countless coarse deficient beings from them, because countless coarse deficient beings are born dependent on each coarse abundant being. There are countless subtle deficient beings from them, because their area is countless times larger due to their pervasiveness in all the universes. There are countless subtle abundant beings from them, because they are always countless due to their permanence. Similarly, one should consider the relative abundance of subtle coarse earth-bodied, water-bodied, luminous-bodied, air-bodied, plant-bodied, and nigoda abundant and deficient beings.
* **15. The relative abundance of subtle coarse abundant and deficient beings in totality (according to Sutra 251):** The least abundant are the coarse luminous-bodied beings, because they are as numerous as the amount of time in the mathematical interval-time category from a few short interval-times. There are countless coarse tremor-bodied abundant beings from them, because they are as numerous as the number of parts of an angula in the universe.

[240] The *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* is the evidence. From it, the *bādar* *trasa-kāyika* are innumerable times less than the *bādar* *paryāpta* in number. This should be understood by the same logic as before. From them, each *bādar* *vanaspati-kāyika*, *bādar* *nigoda*, *bādar* *pṛthvī-kāyika*, *bādar* *ap-kāyika*, and *bādar* *vāyu-kāyika* are innumerable times more in number, in ascending order. To understand this, the same logic should be applied as before. From them, the *bādar* *tejas-kāyika* are innumerable times less than the *bādar* *paryāpta* because they are as numerous as the innumerable *loka-ākāśa-pradeśa*. After that, each body is innumerable times more than the *bādar* *vanaspati-kāyika*, *bādar* *nigoda*, *bādar* *pṛthvī-kāyika*, *bādar* *ap-kāyika*, and *bādar* *vāyu-kāyika*, in ascending order. From them, the *sūkṣma* *tejas-kāyika* are innumerable times less than the *paryāpta*. From them, the *sūkṣma* *pṛthvī-kāyika*, *sūkṣma* *ap-kāyika*, and *sūkṣma* *vāyu-kāyika* are more numerous in ascending order. From them, the *sūkṣma* *tejas-kāyika* are innumerable times more than the *paryāpta* because the *paryāpta* are more numerous than the *aparyāpta* in the *sūkṣma*. From them, the *sūkṣma* *pṛthvī-kāyika*, *sūkṣma* *ap-kāyika*, and *sūkṣma* *vāyu-kāyika* are more numerous in ascending order. From them, the *sūkṣma* *nigoda* are innumerable times less than the *paryāpta* because they are extremely abundant in all the *lokas*. From them, the *sūkṣma* *nigoda* are innumerable times more than the *paryāpta* according to the previous rule. From them, the *bādar* *vanaspati-kāyika* are infinite times more than the *paryāpta*. This should also be understood by the same logic as before. From them, the *bādar* *paryāpta* are more numerous because they include the *bādar* *paryāpta* *tejas-kāyika* etc. From them, the *bādar* *vanaspati-kāyika* are innumerable times less than the *paryāpta* because innumerable *bādar* *nigoda* *aparyāpta* are born dependent on each *bādar* *nigoda*. In general, the *bādar* are more numerous because they also include the *paryāpta*. From them, the *sūkṣma* *vanaspati-kāyika* are innumerable times less than the *paryāpta* because the *sūkṣma* *nigoda* *aparyāpta* are innumerable times more than the *bādar* *nigoda*. In general, the *sūkṣma* *aparyāpta* are innumerable times more than the *paryāpta* because they also include the *aparyāpta* *sūkṣma* *pṛthvī-kāyika* etc. From them, the *sūkṣma* *vanaspati-kāyika* are innumerable times more than the *paryāpta* because the *paryāpta* are innumerable times more than the *aparyāpta*. In general, the *sūkṣma* *paryāpta* are more numerous because they also include the *paryāpta* *sūkṣma* *pṛthvī-kāyika* etc. Compared to them, the *sūkṣma* (general) are more numerous without the distinction of *paryāpta* and *aparyāpta* because they include both *paryāpta* and *aparyāpta*. Thus, the *sūkṣma* *bādar* community should be understood as being few in number. // The fourth *kāya-dvāra* is complete. // The fifth *yoga-dvāra*: The fewness of the *jīvas* in relation to the *yogas* 252. "O Venerable One! Of these *jīvas* who are *sajogī* (with *yoga*), *mano-yogī*, *vacana-yogī*, *kāya-yogī*, and *ayogī*, which are fewer, which are more numerous, which are equal, and which are more numerous than others?" 1.

## Third Multi-Statement Difficulty [241 - [252 U.] Gautama! 1. The least numerous beings are those with manoyoga, 2. (compared to them) beings with vachanayoga are countless times more, 3. (compared to them) ayogi are infinite times more, 4. (compared to them) kayayogi are infinite times more, and 5. (compared to them) sayogi are especially numerous. - Fifth Door // 1 //

**Discussion - Fifth Yoga Door:** The consideration of the relative abundance of beings in relation to yogas - this section (252) discusses the relative abundance of sayogi, ayogi, manoyogi, vachanayogi, and kayayogi. The least numerous beings are those with manoyoga, because only beings with sufficient knowledge have manoyoga, and they are few. Compared to them, beings with vachanayoga are countless times more, because beings with two senses or more, who have vachanayoga and knowledge, are countless times more. Compared to them, ayogi are infinite times more, because Siddha beings are infinite. Compared to them, beings with kayayoga are infinite times more, because even just the beings with plant-like bodies are infinite compared to Siddhas. Although infinite Nigoda beings have one body, they all take in food and other things through that same body, so there is no obstacle to their being infinite in number because they all have kayayoga. Compared to them, sayogi are generally especially numerous, because sayogi include beings with two senses up to five senses.

## Sixth Veda Door: Relative Abundance of Beings in Relation to Vedas 253. Thus, O Venerable One! Among these beings with vedas (savadi), female-veda (strivedi), male-veda (purushavedi), neuter-veda (napunsakavedi), and without vedas (avedi), which are less, which are more, which are equal, and which are especially numerous? Gotama! 1. The least numerous beings are those with male-veda (purushavedi), 2. (compared to them) those with female-veda (strivedi) are countless times more; 3. (compared to them) those without vedas (avedi) are infinite times more, 4. (compared to them) those with neuter-veda (napunsakavedi) are infinite times more, and 5. (compared to them) those with vedas (savadi) are especially numerous. Sixth Door // 6 //

**Discussion - Sixth Veda Door:** The consideration of the relative abundance of beings in relation to vedas - this section (253) discusses the relative abundance of beings through the Veda Door. The least numerous are those with male-veda (purushavedi), because male-veda is found only in sentient beings with animal bodies, humans, and gods. Compared to them, beings with female-veda (strivedi) are countless times more, because the Jivaabhigamsutra states: "There are three times more female animals than male animals, and three more; and there are twenty-seven times more human females than human males, and twenty-seven more; and there are thirty-two times more goddesses than gods, and thirty-two more." Compared to them, those without vedas (Siddhas) are infinite times more, because all beings who are without female-veda, male-veda, and neuter-veda, from the upper part of the ninth guna-sthana onwards, and all Siddha beings, are called avedi, and Siddha beings are infinite. Compared to those without vedas (avedi), those with neuter-veda (napunsakavedi) are infinite times more, because beings in hell, those with one sense, etc., are all napunsakavedi.

Page #275:
---------------------------
[242] The [Prajñāpanā Sūtra] states that plant-bodied beings are infinite, and all of them are neuter. Compared to them, sentient beings are generally more numerous, because all beings, including female, male, and neuter, are included in them. Seventh Gate of Kṣayā: The relative scarcity of beings in relation to Kṣayā 254.  "Thus, venerable sir! Among these beings who are possessed of all Kṣayā, anger Kṣayā, pride Kṣayā, deceit Kṣayā, greed Kṣayā, and without Kṣayā, which are more numerous, which are less numerous, which are equal, and which are more numerous than others?" "Gautama! 1. Beings without Kṣayā are the least numerous, 2. (Compared to them) beings with pride Kṣayā are infinitely more numerous, 3. (Compared to them) beings with anger Kṣayā are more numerous than others, 4. (Compared to them) beings with deceit Kṣayā are more numerous than others, 5. (Compared to them) beings with greed Kṣayā are more numerous than others, and (compared to them) 6. beings with all Kṣayā are more numerous than others.  Discussion-Seventh Gate of Kṣayā: The relative scarcity of beings in relation to Kṣayā-The present Sūtra (254) considers the relative scarcity of beings in relation to Kṣayā.  /  _The relative abundance or scarcity of beings in relation to Kṣayā-Beings without Kṣayā-those who are free from the results of Kṣayā-are the least numerous, because only a few humans with weakened Kṣayā, etc., and Siddha beings are free from Kṣayā.  /  Beings with pride Kṣayā are infinitely more numerous than them because pride Kṣayā is found in all six categories of beings.  /  Beings with anger Kṣayā, deceit Kṣayā, and greed Kṣayā are progressively more numerous than them because the duration of the results of anger, etc., Kṣayā is progressively longer.  /  The previous Kṣayā are naturally included in the subsequent Kṣayā, and beings with all Kṣayā are more numerous than beings with greed Kṣayā because there are many beings who have the ordinary arising of Kṣayā, and they include all beings who have the arising of pride, etc., Kṣayā.  The special meaning of the word "Sakṣayī"-The word "Kṣayā" should be understood as meaning the arising of Kṣayā.  From this perspective, the meaning of "Sakṣayī" is "possessing the arising of Kṣayā" or "one in whom Kṣayā is present," or "one in whom the atoms of Kṣayā karma that have attained the state of ripening are manifesting their arising."  /  1.

**[255 Q.]** O Bhagavan! Among these beings with Salesshya, Krishna-leshya, Nila-leshya, Kapota-leshya, Tejo-leshya, Padma-leshya, Shukla-leshya, and those without Leshya (Alesshya), which are less, which are more, which are equal, and which are superior?

**[255 A.]** Gautama! 1. The fewest are the beings with Shukla-leshya, 2. (compared to them) the beings with Padma-leshya are numerous times more, 3. (compared to them) the beings with Tejo-leshya are numerous times more, 4. (compared to them) the beings without Leshya are infinitely more, 5. (compared to them) the beings with Kapota-leshya are infinitely more, 6. (compared to them) the beings with Nila-leshya are superior; 7. (compared to them) the beings with Krishna-leshya are superior, 8. (compared to them) the beings with Salesshya are superior. Eighth Gate // 8 //

**Discussion:** The Eighth Gate of Leshya presents the relative abundance of beings with Salesshya, the six distinct Leshyas, and those without Leshya, as per the sutra (255).

**Relative Abundance Based on Leshya:** The beings with Shukla-leshya are the fewest, as Shukla-leshya is found only in beings from the Lantank to the Uttara Vaimanika Devas, in some humans with a lifespan of a number of years in the Garbhaja Karmabhoomi, and in some Tiryanch-stri-purushas with a lifespan of a number of years.

Compared to them, the beings with Padma-leshya are numerous times more, as Padma-leshya is found in the Sanatkumar, Mahendra, and Brahma-loka-kalpa-dwelling Devas, in a large number of humans with a lifespan of a number of years in the Garbhaja-karmabhoomi, and in Garbhaja-tiryanch-stri-purushas. These beings, including the Sanatkumar Devas and the Lantank Devas, are numerous times more than the beings with Shukla-leshya.

Compared to them, the beings with Tejo-leshya are numerous times more, as Tejo-leshya is found in all the Saudharma and Ishana-kalpa Vaimanika Devas, in all the Jyotishka Devas, and in some Bhavanapati, Vanavyantara, Garbhaja-tiryanch-panchendriya, and human beings, and in the Badara-paryapta-ekendriya beings. Although the Jyotishka Devas are countless times more than the Bhavanavasi Devas and the Sanatkumar Devas, the beings with Tejo-leshya are only numerous times more than the beings with Padma-leshya.

This statement is not only about the Leshyas of the Devas, but about all beings. Therefore, the beings with Padma-leshya include many Tiryanch besides the Devas. Similarly, the beings with Tejo-leshya also include many Tiryanch, and the beings with Padma-leshya are also numerous. Therefore, the beings with Tejo-leshya can only be numerous times more than them, not countless times more.

Compared to the beings with Tejo-leshya, the beings without Leshya (Alesshya - Siddhas) are infinitely more, as the Siddha beings are infinite. Compared to them, the beings with Kapota-leshya are infinitely more, as Kapota-leshya is possible even in the Vanaspatika beings, and the Vanaspatika beings are...

[244] The liberated souls (Siddhas) are infinitely more numerous than the living beings. Among the living beings, those with blue karma (Neelaleshya) are more numerous than those with pigeon-colored karma (Kapoteleshya), because the beings with blue karma are more abundant than those with pigeon-colored karma. Those with black karma (Krishna leshya) are more numerous than those with blue karma, because they are the most abundant. Compared to them, the beings with karma in general (Seleshya) are more numerous, because all the beings with karma, including those with blue karma, etc., are included in the category of Seleshya. Ninth Gate of Vision (Samyaktva): The relative abundance of beings in terms of the three visions 256.  "Bhante! Among the living beings, which are more numerous, which are fewer, which are equal, and which are more special, in terms of those with right vision (Samyaktva), wrong vision (Mithyatva), and mixed vision (Samyagmithyatva)?"  "Gotama! 1. The beings with mixed vision (Samyagmithyatva) are the fewest, 2. (compared to them) the beings with right vision (Samyaktva) are infinitely more numerous, and 3. (compared to them) the beings with wrong vision (Mithyatva) are infinitely more numerous." Ninth Gate of Vision // 6 // Discussion - Ninth Gate of Vision: The relative abundance of beings in terms of the three visions - This sutra (256) discusses the relative abundance of beings in terms of right vision (Samyaktva), wrong vision (Mithyatva), and mixed vision (Samyagmithyatva). The beings with mixed vision (Samyagmithyatva) are the fewest, because the duration of the result of mixed vision is only a moment (antarmuhurta), and therefore, due to its very short duration, they are found in small numbers at the time of the question. Compared to them, the beings with right vision (Samyaktva) are infinitely more numerous, because the Siddhas are infinite, and they are included only among the beings with right vision. Compared to the beings with right vision (Samyaktva), the beings with wrong vision (Mithyatva) are infinitely more numerous, because the beings with plant-like bodies (Vanaspatikayika), etc., are infinitely more numerous than the Siddhas, and the beings with plant-like bodies are only those with wrong vision. Tenth Gate of Knowledge: The relative abundance of beings in terms of knowledge and wisdom 257. "Bhante! Among the living beings, which are more numerous, which are fewer, which are equal, and which are more special, in terms of those with knowledge of the past (Prabhinibodha), those with knowledge of the present (Sutana), those with knowledge of the future (Prohina), those with knowledge of the mind (Manaprajna), and those with perfect knowledge (Kevala)?"  "Gotama! 1. The beings with knowledge of the mind (Manaprajna) are the fewest, 2. (compared to them) the beings with knowledge of the future (Prohina) are countless times more numerous, 3. (compared to them) the beings with knowledge of the past (Prabhinibodha) and those with knowledge of the present (Sutana) are equal and more special, and 4. (compared to them) the beings with perfect knowledge (Kevala) are infinitely more numerous." 1. (a) Prajnapanasutra Malay.

Tenth (knowledge) gate // 10 // **Discussion - Tenth Knowledge Gate:** In terms of knowledge and understanding, the relative abundance of beings is presented in three sutras (257 to 256). From the perspective of five types of knowledge and three types of ignorance, the relative abundance of beings is considered. In terms of knowledge, **Manas-paryaya-jnani** are the fewest, because **Manas-paryaya-jnana** is only attained by those who are restrained and have attained powers such as **amarsha-aushadhi**. **Avadhi-jnani** are countless times more than them, because **Avadhi-jnana** is also attained by hell beings, **tiryanch** with five senses, humans, and gods. **Abhinibodhik**

## Translation:

**The Prajñapanasutra states that both the Knower (Jñānī) and the Knower of the Scriptures (Śruta-jñānī) are privileged, because even those sentient beings, animals, and humans who do not possess Avadhi-jñāna (Clairvoyance) can still attain Abhinibodhik-jñāna (Intuitive Knowledge) and Śruta-jñāna (Scriptural Knowledge). The reason for equating these two types of knowledge is that they are mutually interdependent. The Kevala-jñānī (Omniscient) is infinitely superior to both these Knowers, because the Siddhas (Liberated Souls) are Kevala-jñānī and they are infinite. In terms of Prajñāna (Wisdom), the Vibhangajñānī (Knower of Differentiation) is the least numerous, because Vibhangajñāna (Differentiated Knowledge) is only possessed by the Mithyādrṣṭi (False Viewers), Nairyāyikas (Materialists), Devas (Gods), and some animals and humans. Compared to Vibhangajñāna, both Mati-ajñāna (Knowledge based on Perception) and Śruta-ajñāna are infinitely superior, because even the Vanaspatikāyika (Plant-bodied) beings are Mati-ajñānī and Śruta-ajñānī, and they are infinite. In their own sphere, Mati-ajñānī and Śruta-ajñānī are equal, because these two types of ignorance are mutually interdependent. Collectively, the Knower and the Knower of the Scriptures are the least numerous among the Manahparyavajñānī (Knowers of the Mind). The relative abundance of those beyond them should be understood in the same way as explained earlier. The Vibhangajñānī beings are countless times more numerous than the Mati-Śruta-jñānī beings, because the Mithyādrṣṭi beings are countless times more numerous than the Samyagdṛṣṭi (Right Viewers) in the Deva-gati (Heavenly Realm) and Manusya-gati (Human Realm). And since the Samyagdṛṣṭi beings in the Deva-gati and Naraka-gati (Hellish Realm) are Avadhi-jñānī and the Mithyādrṣṭi beings are Vibhangajñānī, the Vibhangajñānī are countless times more numerous than them. The Kevala-jñānī are infinitely superior to them, because the Siddhas are infinite. The Mati-ajñānī and Śruta-ajñānī are infinitely superior to them, because the Mati-Śruta-ajñānī include even the Vanaspatikāyika beings, and they are infinitely more numerous than the Siddhas. In their own sphere, these two types of ignorance are equal. Eleventh Gate of Vision: Relative Abundance of Beings in Terms of Vision. 260. "O Venerable One!

## Third Multi-Statement Difficulty [247]

The least numerous are those with *avadhi* vision, because *avadhi* vision is only present in gods, hell beings, and some five-sensed beings with *sanjna* (consciousness), and humans. 

Compared to them, those with *chakshus* vision are countless times more numerous, because *chakshus* vision is present in all gods, hell beings, humans in the womb, five-sensed beings with *sanjna*, and five-sensed beings without *sanjna*.

Compared to them, those with *kevala* vision are infinitely more numerous, because the liberated souls are infinite.

Compared to them, those with *achakshus* vision are infinitely more numerous, because those with *achakshus* vision include plant-bodied beings, who alone are infinitely more numerous than the liberated souls.

## Twelfth Restrained Gate: The Relative Scarcity of Beings Compared to the Restrained Ones [261]

**[261]**  O Lord! Among these restrained, unrestrained, restrained-restrained, and unrestrained-un-restrained-un-restrained-restrained beings, which are the least, which are the most, which are equal, and which are superior?

**[261]**  Gautama! 1. The least numerous are the restrained beings, 2. (compared to them) the restrained-restrained are countless times more numerous, 3. (compared to them) the unrestrained-un-restrained-un-restrained-restrained beings are infinitely more numerous, (and compared to them) 4. the unrestrained beings are infinitely more numerous.

## Twelfth (Restrained) Gate / / 12 / /

**Commentary:** The Twelfth Restrained Gate: The Relative Scarcity of Beings - This sutra (261) presents the relative scarcity of beings from the perspective of the restrained, unrestrained, restrained-restrained, and unrestrained-un-restrained-un-restrained-restrained. The least numerous are the restrained, because in the human realm, they are found at most in the *kotisahasrapruthaktva* (hundreds of thousands of millions), that is, from two to nine billion. Compared to them, the restrained-restrained (those who have renounced the world) are countless times more numerous, because *deshvirati* (renunciation of the world) is also found in countless non-human five-sensed beings besides humans. Compared to them, the unrestrained-un-restrained (un-restrained-restrained) are infinitely more numerous, because those who cannot be called restrained, unrestrained, or restrained-restrained, such as the liberated souls, are infinite. Compared to them, the unrestrained are infinitely more numerous, because plant-bodied beings are also unrestrained, and they alone are infinitely more numerous than the liberated souls.

## Thirteenth Use Gate: The Relative Scarcity of Beings from the Perspective of the Use Gate [262]

**[262]**  O Lord! Among these beings who are *sagaro-vuttana* (those who have attained the ocean of knowledge) and *anagaro-vuttana* (those who have not attained the ocean of knowledge), which are the least, which are the most, which are equal, and which are superior?

**[262]**  Gautama! 1. The least numerous are the *anagaro-vuttana* beings, 2. (compared to them) the *sagaro-vuttana* beings are countless times more numerous.

Thirteenth (use) gate // 13 // Discussion Thirteenth use gate: The present sūtra (262) discusses the relative abundance of embodied and unembodied beings from the perspective of use. The time of unembodied use is short, while the time of embodied use is countless times longer. Therefore, it is said that at the time of questioning, unembodied beings (darshanopयोग) are few because their time is short, and embodied beings (jñānopयोग) are countless times more.

Fourteenth (food) gate // 14 // Discussion-Fourteenth food gate: The present sūtra (263) discusses the relative abundance of food-eating and non-food-eating beings from the perspective of food. The non-food-eating beings are the fewest, because only those beings who are in the state of disintegration, those who have attained liberation, and those who are non-yogic Siddhas are non-food-eating. Food-eating beings are countless times more than them.  /  The question may arise that among food-eating beings, there are also plant-bodied beings, and they are infinite compared to Siddhas, then why are they not said to be infinite times more than non-food-eating beings? Why are they only said to be countless times more? The answer is that even if all the subtle nigodas are combined, they are countless, and even among them, they are equal to the amount of time in an antarmūhūrta, and they are always in the state of disintegration, therefore, there are also many non-food-eating beings among them, and they are equal to an immeasurable part of the total number of beings.  /  Therefore, food-eating beings are countless times more than them, not infinite times more. 1.

**The Fifteenth (Speech) Door** // 15 //

**Discussion:** The Fifteenth Door of Speech: The Fewness of Beings in Relation to Speech - This sutra discusses the relative fewness of speaker and non-speaker beings.

**Explanation of Speaker and Non-Speaker:** Beings who possess the ability to speak are called speakers, and those who lack this ability are called non-speakers.

**Why are non-speakers infinitely more numerous than speakers?** Speaker beings range from those with two senses to those with five senses, while non-speakers include one-sensed beings, among whom the plant-bodied beings alone are infinite. Therefore, non-speakers are said to be infinitely more numerous than speakers.

**Explanation of Pariita, etc.:** The general meaning of Pariita is "limited" or "finite." In this context, two types of Pariita are described: Bhava-parita and Kaya-parita.

Such beings are in the dark fortnight. From the perspective of parita-praadi, both types of parita beings are the fewest, because the number of those in the bright fortnight and those in every embodied state is less than the total number of beings. Compared to them, the nopari-tanopari, i.e., those who are different from both of these, are the Siddhas, who are infinite.

In terms of Paryapti, the Noparyapta-Noaparyapta beings are the fewest, because the Siddhas, who are devoid of Paryapti and Aparyapti, are fewer than the Paryapta and Aparyapta. Compared to them, the Aparyapta beings are infinite times more, because they are infinite times more than the ordinary plant-bodied Siddhas, who are always found to be Aparyapta. / Compared to them, the Paryapta beings are countless times more.

The fewest are Abhava Siddhika: Jivas ineligible for liberation, as they are of the lowest Yuktānantyaka quantity. According to the Anuyoga Dvāra, 'combining one form (number) in the highest Pari-tānantyaka results in 'lowest Yuktānantyaka'; Abhava Siddhika are that many. Compared to them, No-Bhava Siddhika-No-Prabhava Siddhika are infinitely more, because those who are neither Bhavyas nor Abhavyas are Siddhas, and they are of the highest Yuktānantyaka quantity, which is why they are infinite.  /  Compared to them, Bhava Siddhika-Bhavyas eligible for liberation are infinitely more, because a Siddha is equal to an infinite number of Bhavyas, and such Bhavyas are countless in the Lokas.

## Third Multi-Statement Difficulty [255 is less than infinity, 4. It is countless times greater than the number of space, 5. (From this) it is infinitely greater than the Pudgalastikaya substance, 6. The same (Pudgalastikaya) is countless times greater than the number of space. 7. Shraddha-time (time) (from that) is infinitely greater than substance and space, 7. and (from that) it is infinitely greater than the Akashastikaya space. Twenty-first (Astikaya) Door  /  / 21 //  Discussion - Twenty-first Astikaya Door: Through the Astikaya Door, the lesser and greater nature of the six substances is presented in four sutras (Sutras 270 to 273). The lesser and greater nature of the six substances, in comparison to substance, space, and both substance and space, is considered. The lesser nature of the six substances in comparison to substance - (1) Dharmaastikaya, etc., three substances, being one in number in terms of substance, are the least  /  Jivaastikaya is infinitely greater than these three in comparison to substance, because the jivas are infinite and they are each separate substances. Pudgalastikaya is even greater than that in comparison to substance, because atoms, dvipradeshi skandha, etc., are separate independent substances, and they are generally of three types - prayogaparinat, mishraparinat, and visrasaparinat. Of these, only prayogaparinat pudgal is infinitely greater than the jivas  /  In addition, each jiva is enveloped-surrounded (connected) by infinite-infinite jnanaavaraneya, darshanavaraneya, vedaniya, etc., karma atoms (skandhas), as stated in the Vyākhyāprajñapti (Bhagavati) - 'The least are prayogaparinat pudgal, mishraparinat pudgal is infinitely greater than them, and visrasaparinat is infinitely greater than them  / ' Therefore, it is proven that Pudgalastikaya is infinitely greater than Jivaastikaya substance in comparison to substance. Shraddha-time is infinitely greater than Pudgalastikaya in terms of substance; because the future time of a single atom, being dvipradeshi, yavat dashapradeshi, sankhyatpradeshi, asankhyatpradeshi, and anantpradeshi skandhas, is infinite due to the infinite combinations of a single atom in the future, and these infinite combinations that occur in different times can only be known by knowledge. Just as there are infinite combinations of a single atom, so too are there infinite-infinite combinations of each of the dvipradeshi skandha, etc., all atoms in different times. All these transformations occur within the human realm (kshetra)  /  Therefore, from the perspective of the kshetra, the future combinations of each atom are infinite. For example, this atom will be in a particular space in a particular time, in another space in another time  /  Just as there are infinite future combinations of a single atom from the perspective of the kshetra, so too are there infinite future combinations of each of the dvipradeshi, etc., skandhas up to anantpradeshi skandha, in different times due to the difference in their immersion in each space. Similarly, in comparison to time, this atom is in a state of one time in this space, in a state of two times, etc. In this way, there are countless future combinations of a single atom in one space, similarly, there are countless-countless future combinations of each atom in all spaces, then again and again, when time is reversed in those spaces, and since time is infinite, the future combinations are infinite in comparison to time. Just as there are infinite future combinations of a single atom in comparison to kshetra and time, and there are separate infinite-infinite combinations of each of the dvipradeshi skandha, etc., atoms. Similarly, it should be understood in comparison to the state  /  For example, this atom will be in a state of one quality in a particular time. In this way, there are 1. 'Savvathova puggalā payogaparinaȳā, mosaparinaȳā aṇantguṇā, vīsasa parinaȳā aṇantguṇā.' - Vyākhyāprajñapti Sutra

Page #289:
---------------------------
## 256]  One should understand that there are infinite combinations in different times, in relation to the *bhavas* (states of being).  

There are also infinite combinations in relation to the *bhavas* of all atoms, and of the *skandhas* (aggregates) like *dvipradeshi* (two-dimensional), etc., individually, like a single atom.  

Considering this, infinite future times are established in relation to the specific *dravya* (substance), *kshetra* (space), *kala* (time), and *bhavas* of a single atom.  And what is true for a single atom, should also be understood in relation to all atoms and the *skandhas* like *dvipradeshi*, etc.  

All this cannot be consistent without the object called *parinamanasheel kala* (changeable time), and without the objects like *parinamanasheel pudgalastikaya* (changeable pudgala substance), etc.  

Just as infinite future *ardhakalas* (half-times) have been established in relation to the specific *dravya*, *kshetra*, *kala*, and *bhavas* of each of the atoms, *dvipradeshi*, etc. *skandhas*, similarly, one should understand the past *ardhakalas*.  

(2) In relation to the *pradeshas* (regions), *dharmastikaya* (substance of dharma), etc. are equal to both *alpabahutva-dharmastikaya* (substance of lesser multiplicity) and *adharmastikaya* (substance of non-dharma), because the *pradeshas* of both are equal to the *pradeshas* of *lokaakasha* (space of the world).  Therefore, their *pradeshas* are the least compared to other *dravya*.  

Compared to these two, *jivaastikaya* (substance of the soul) *pradeshas* are infinitely greater, because there are infinite *jiva* (souls), and the *pradeshas* of each *jiva* are equal to the *pradeshas* of *lokaakasha*.  

Compared to that, *pudgalastikaya* (substance of pudgala) *pradeshas* are infinitely greater, because even if we leave out other classifications of *pudgala* and only take the *karma* classification, even a single *pradesha* of a *jiva* is covered by infinite-infinite *karma* atoms (*karma* *skandha* *pradeshas*).  

Besides the *karma* classification, there are many other classifications like *oudarik* (generous), *vaikriya* (changeable), etc.  Therefore, it is naturally established that the *pradeshas* of *pudgalastikaya* are infinitely greater than the *pradeshas* of *jivaastikaya*.  

Compared to *pudgalastikaya*, the *pradeshas* of *ardhakalas* are infinitely greater, because as mentioned earlier, due to the relation of each *pudgalastikaya* with its respective (different) *dravya*, *kshetra*, *kala*, and *bhavas*, the past and future times are infinite-infinite.  

Compared to *ardhakalas*, the *pradeshas* of *akashaastikaya* (substance of space) are infinitely greater, because *alokaakasha* (non-world space) is infinite and boundless everywhere.  

In relation to *dravya* and *pradeshas*, *dharmastikaya*, etc. are less than *alpabahutva-dharmastikaya* and *adharmastikaya*, both in terms of *dravya*, because both are only one *dravya* each.  But in terms of *pradeshas*, they are countless times greater than *dravya*, because both are countless-regioned.  

*Akashaastikaya* is the least in terms of *dravya*, because it is one, but in terms of *pradeshas*, it is infinitely greater because its *pradeshas* are infinite-infinite.  

*Jivaastikaya* is less in terms of *dravya* and countless times greater in terms of *pradeshas*, because each *jiva* has countless-countless *pradeshas* equal to the *pradeshas* of *lokaakasha*.  

*Pudgalastikaya* is less in terms of *dravya*, because *dravya* is always less than *pradeshas*, but in terms of *pradeshas*, *pudgalastikaya* is countless times greater.  

The question may arise that there are many *pudgalaskandha* in the world that are infinite-regioned, therefore, *pudgalastikaya* should be infinitely greater than *dravya* in terms of *pradeshas*.

[257 The solution to this is that from the perspective of substance, the infinite-region skandhas are the least, while atoms and so on are the most.  /  Further, it will be said in the Prajñāpanā Sūtra - "From the perspective of substance, the infinite-region skandhas are the least, the atomic pudgalas are infinitely numerous from the perspective of substance. From the perspective of substance, the countable-region skandhas are countably numerous, and the uncountable-region skandhas are uncountably numerous."  /  According to this text, when the entire pudgalāstikāya is contemplated from the perspective of region, then the infinite-region skandhas are very few and the atoms are very many, and because they are separate substances, the uncountable-region skandhas are uncountably numerous compared to the atoms.  /  Therefore, the pudgalāstikāya can only be uncountably numerous compared to the regions, not infinitely numerous.  /  In the case of the time substance, the question of the fewness or numerousness of substance and regions should not be raised, because time does not have regions.  /  Time is only substance, it does not have regions, because when atoms become transformed in relation to each other (mutually), then their group is called a skandha and its components are called regions. If those atoms are mutually independent, then their group cannot be called a skandha.  /  Time (kāladravy) is mutually independent, it is not a substance that is mutually dependent (afflicted) like a skandha.  /  When the present time is, then there is a lack of time before and after it.  /  Therefore, there is a lack of skandha-like transformation in them.  /  Therefore, time (kāladravy) does not have regions.  /  The relative fewness or numerousness of the dharmaāstikāya, etc., from the perspective of substance and region - the dharmaāstikāya, etc., are the least from the perspective of substance, because all three are one substance each.  /  Compared to them, the dharmaāstikāya and adharmaāstikāya are both equal and uncountably numerous from the perspective of regions, because both have uncountably many regions.  /  Compared to these two, the jīvāstikāya is infinitely numerous from the perspective of substance, because there are infinite jīvas.  /  Compared to them, the jīvāstikāya is uncountably numerous from the perspective of region, because each jīva has uncountably many regions.  /  Compared to the jīvāstikāya in the form of region, the pudgalāstikāya in the form of substance is infinitely numerous, because there are infinite karma-pudgalas associated with each region of a jīva.  /  Compared to the pudgalāstikāya in the form of substance, the pudgalāstikāya in the form of region is uncountably numerous.  /  The reason for this has been explained before.  /  Compared to the pudgalāstikāya in the form of region, time (kāladravy) is infinitely numerous from the perspective of substance and region, according to the aforementioned reasoning.  /  Compared to it, the ākāśāstikāya is infinitely numerous from the perspective of regions, because the ākāśāstikāya is infinite in all directions, it has no boundary; whereas time (kāladravy) only exists in the human realm.  /  The twenty-second gate: The fewness or numerousness of the extreme and non-extreme jīvas  /  274.

## Chapter 24 of the Prajñāpanā Sūtra: The Relative Scarcity of Beings in the Upper, Lower, and Intermediate Realms

This chapter, comprising 49 sūtras (276-324), discusses the relative scarcity of beings in the various realms, including the upper, lower, and intermediate realms, as well as the three realms (triloka), based on the concept of "kṣetrāṇuvāeṇam."

**Explanation of "kṣetrāṇuvāeṇam":**  This term refers to considering something in relation to its field or scope. In this context, it means considering the number of beings in relation to the size of the realm they inhabit.

**Explanation of "ūrdhvaloka," "tiryagloka," and other terms:** According to Jain scriptures, the entire universe (loka) is fourteen rajjus (a unit of measurement) in extent. It is divided into three parts: the upper realm (ūrdhvaloka), the intermediate realm (tiryagloka), and the lower realm (adholoka). The boundaries of these realms are determined by the "rucakas" (a type of celestial being). For example, the intermediate realm extends nine hundred yojanas (a unit of distance) above and below the rucakas. The lower realm lies below the intermediate realm, and the upper realm lies above it. The upper realm is slightly less than seven rajjus in extent, while the lower realm is slightly more than seven rajjus. The intermediate realm, which lies between them, is 1800 yojanas high.

The lowermost region of the upper realm and the uppermost region of the intermediate realm are known as "ūrdhvaloka-tiryagloka." This means that nine hundred yojanas above the rucakas' level, there is a single-region sky-region (ākāśa-pradeśa-pratar) belonging to the intermediate realm. This is the "tiryagloka-pratar." The single-region sky-region above it is called the "ūrdhvaloka-pratar." These two regions together are called "ūrdhvaloka-tiryagloka."

Similarly, the single-region sky-region above the lower realm and the single-region sky-region below the intermediate realm are called "adholoka-tiryagloka."

**"Triloka"** refers to the three realms (upper, intermediate, and lower).

Thus, the entire universe (kṣetra) is divided into six parts for the purpose of understanding the relative scarcity of beings: (1) upper realm, (2) intermediate realm, (3) lower realm, (4) upper realm-intermediate realm, (5) lower realm-intermediate realm, and (6) three realms.

**Relative Scarcity of Beings in the Six Realms:**

* **Upper Realm-Intermediate Realm:** The fewest beings reside in this region because it is the smallest.
* **Lower Realm-Intermediate Realm:** There are more beings in this region than in the upper realm-intermediate realm because it includes beings who are migrating through it or who reside there permanently.
* **Intermediate Realm:** The number of beings in the intermediate realm is countless times greater than in the previous two regions because it is vastly larger.
* **Three Realms:** The number of beings who touch all three realms is countless times greater than those in the intermediate realm. This refers to beings who migrate through all three realms.
* **Upper Realm:** The number of beings in the upper realm is countless times greater than those who touch all three realms because the upper realm has a vast number of "upapāta-kṣetra" (regions where beings are born).
* **Lower Realm:** The number of beings in the lower realm is greater than those in the upper realm because the lower realm is slightly more than seven rajjus in extent.

**Relative Scarcity of Beings in the Four Gati (Types of Existence) Based on the Realm:**

* **Hell Beings (Naraka-gata):** The fewest hell beings reside in the three realms, meaning those who touch all three realms.

**Note:** There may be a question about this statement. The Prajñāpanā Sūtra, Malay, Vṛtti, Patraṅka 144, states that the number of beings who are not born (aprajatta) is infinite, while the number of beings who are born (pajjatta) is countable.

Page #304:
---------------------------
## Third Multiplicity of Statements

**[271] How can hell beings touch all three realms when they are situated only in the lower realm, and how are they the fewest?**

The solution is that those who are born in the hell of fish, etc., residing in the pools on the peak of Mount Meru or on the peaks of Anjan, Dadhimuka, etc., at the time of death, spread their self-regions through the force of karma, touching all three realms. At that time, they are called hell beings because their birth in hell is imminent, and they experience the suffering of the hell life. Such hell beings are few, hence they are called the fewest.

**Compared to the hell beings who touch all three realms, there are countless times more hell beings in the lower realm and the intermediate realm.** This is because countless beings with five senses, residing in countless islands and oceans, when born in hell, touch these two realms. Therefore, they are countless times more than the hell beings who touch all three realms, because their region is countless times larger.

**The region of countless islands and oceans is countless times larger than the region of Mount Meru, etc.**

**(2) The fewest beings in the intermediate realm are those who are in the upper realm of the intermediate realm and the lower realm of the upper realm.** Compared to them, there are more beings in the lower realm and the intermediate realm, which are the upper realm of the lower realm and the lower realm of the intermediate realm. Compared to these, there are countless times more beings in the intermediate realm, the three realms, and the upper realm, respectively, in ascending order.

**Compared to the beings who touch all three realms, there are countless times more beings in the upper realm (in the realm called the upper realm).** Compared to these, there are more beings in the lower realm.

**The fewest female beings in the intermediate realm are those who touch the upper realm.** This is because there are female beings with five senses in the pools of Mount Meru, etc. Their region is small. Therefore, they are called the fewest. Compared to them, there are countless times more female beings in the upper realm and the intermediate realm (those who touch the two realms of the upper realm and the intermediate realm). This is because gods up to the Sahasrar Devaloka can be born in the wombs of female beings with five senses, and beings with the remaining bodies can also be born in them.

**When gods up to the Sahasrar Devaloka or beings with the remaining bodies are about to be born in the intermediate realm as female beings with five senses from the upper realm, they experience the lifespan of the female being.** In addition, when female beings with five senses in the intermediate realm are about to be born in the upper realm as gods or in any other form, they spread their self-regions to their place of birth through the force of karma at the time of death. By doing so, they touch both the aforementioned realms. At that time, they are called female beings of the intermediate realm, hence they are called countless times more. Compared to them, there are countless times more female beings in the three realms, those who touch all three realms.

**When beings from the lower realm, such as those who dwell in houses, those who live in the intermediate realm, those who are in hell, and those with other bodies, are born in the upper realm as female beings with five senses, or when a god, etc., from the upper realm is born in the lower realm as a female being, and they spread their self-regions in the form of punishment through the force of karma, they touch all three realms.**

**Such beings are many, hence it is appropriate to say that there are countless times more female beings in the three realms.**

**Compared to them, there are countless times more female beings of the intermediate realm who touch the lower realm and the intermediate realm.** Many beings in hell, etc., are born in the intermediate realm as female beings with five senses without experiencing the force of karma. Similarly, beings from the intermediate realm are born in the villages of the lower realm as female beings. At that time, they touch the aforementioned two realms and experience the lifespan of the female being. Therefore, they are called countless times more. Compared to them, there are countless times more female beings in the lower realm, i.e., in the realm of the lower realm.

[272] The [Prajñāpanā Sūtra] states that villages and all oceans are a thousand yojanas deep. Therefore, since the dwelling place of fish and other [tiryañcaya] beings is below nine hundred yojanas, they are abundant in number. For this reason, they are called "numerous." Their territory is also numerous. Compared to the lower realm, [tiryañcaya] beings are more numerous in the [tiryak] realm. (3) Considering the scarcity and abundance of the human realm, humans are the fewest in the three realms (trilokasparsi), because those who are born in the villages of the lower realm and who perform the [maranantika] liberation, some of them, due to their liberation, extend their self-regions beyond the three realms. Some, having attained the [vaikriya] or [ahāraka] liberation, extend their self-regions far up and down through great effort. A few humans who attain the [kevali] liberation touch all three realms. For this reason, humans are the fewest in the three realms. Compared to them, humans who touch the two realms of the upper realm and the [tiryak] realm are innumerable. When [vaimānika] gods or beings with other bodies are born as humans in the [tiryak] realm from the upper realm, they touch the aforementioned two realms. In addition, when [vidyadhara] and others travel on Mount Meru and other places, humans are born in their semen, blood, and other [pudgala] particles, and when they return with their blood and other [pudgala] particles, they touch the aforementioned two realms. They are numerous, therefore they are innumerable. Compared to them, humans who touch the two realms of the lower realm and the [tiryak] realm are numerous, because there is naturally a great deal of harmony among humans in the villages of the lower realm. Therefore, those who are born as humans in the villages of the lower realm from the [tiryak] realm or from other bodies, or those who are born as humans in the [tiryak] realm from the villages of the lower realm or from any other place in the lower realm, touch the aforementioned two realms. Therefore, they are called numerous. Compared to them, humans in the lower realm are more numerous, because there is a great deal of movement of [vidyadhara] and [cāranamuni] who play and do other things in the forests of [saumanasa] and others, and humans are born in their blood and other [pudgala] particles. Compared to them, humans in the lower realm are more numerous, because it is their natural dwelling place, so abundance is natural. Compared to them, humans in the [tiryak] realm are more numerous, because the territory of the [tiryak] realm is more numerous, and it is their dwelling place, so abundance is possible. Compared to the territory of human women, the fewest human women are those who touch all three realms, because when they are born in the lower realm from the upper realm and perform the [maranantika] liberation, they extend their self-regions beyond the three realms, or when they perform the [vaikriya] or [kevali] liberation, they touch all three realms, and such human women are very few, therefore they are said to be the fewest in the three realms. Compared to them, women who touch the two realms of the upper realm and the [tiryak] realm are numerous. When [vaimānika] gods or beings with other bodies are born as human women in the [tiryak] realm from the upper realm, and when human women in the [tiryak] realm perform the [maranantika] liberation when they are born in the upper realm, they extend their self-regions far up, but those who have not yet passed away, they touch the aforementioned two realms, and both types of women are very numerous.

Page #306:
---------------------------
[273] There are many more women in the lower realms and the realm of the animals than in the upper realms. This is because many women are born in the lower realms from the realm of the animals, or from other realms, or are born in the lower realms as women from the realm of the animals. Many of them, while residing in the lower realms, also touch the two realms mentioned above. Such women are far more numerous than the women in the two realms mentioned above. Even more numerous than these are the women in the upper realms (in the realm called the upper realm). This is because many students go to the forests of Saumanas, etc., for play. They are also more numerous than those in the lower realms because they are more prevalent there. They are also more numerous than those in the realm of the animals because the area there is also much larger, and they are also native to that realm. (4) Of the beings in the realm of the gods, the fewest are in the highest realm of the gods, because only the gods of the aerial class reside there, and they are few. And those gods who are the lords of the mansions, etc., who go to Mount Mandara, etc., on the occasion of the birth festivals of the Tirthankaras, etc., are also few. Therefore, the fewest gods are in the highest realm. There are countless times more gods in the two realms called the upper realm and the realm of the animals. These two realms are close to the gods of the stars, and therefore they are their native realms. In addition, the lords of the mansions, the gods of the intermediate space, and the gods of the stars go to Mount Sumeru, etc. Or the gods of the kalpas of Sudharma, etc., come and go to their own places. Or the gods who are born in the form of gods in the heavenly realms of Sudharma, etc., who are experiencing the enjoyment of the divine air, when they go to their place of origin, they touch the two realms mentioned above. Such gods are countless times more numerous than the gods mentioned above. There are many times more gods in the three realms (those who touch the three realms) than these. This is because the lords of the mansions, the gods of the intermediate space, the gods of the stars, and the aerial gods, when they perform the great act of liberation with special effort, touch all three realms. They are many times more numerous than the gods who touch the two realms mentioned above. There are many times more gods who touch the two realms called the lower realm and the realm of the animals than these. This is because these two realms are close to the lords of the mansions and the gods of the intermediate space, and therefore they are their native realms. And many lords of the mansions who reside in their own mansions go to and fro in the realm of the animals, they ascend, and they perform the great act of liberation. Or the five-sensed animals or humans who are in the realm of the animals are born as lords of the mansions, and they experience the enjoyment of the life of a lord of the mansions, then they touch the two realms mentioned above. Such beings are said to be many times more numerous because they are many. There are many times more gods in the lower realm than these, because the lower realm is the native realm of the lords of the mansions. There are many times more gods who reside in the realm of the animals than these, because the realm of the animals is the native realm of the gods of the stars and the gods of the intermediate space. The scarcity of goddesses - The scarcity of goddesses should also be understood in general like the thread of the gods. The scarcity of the lords of the mansions, etc., and the goddesses - (1) The fewest lords of the mansions are in the upper realm. This is because some lords of the mansions go to the heavenly realms of Sudharma, etc., from the influence of their companions in their previous lives. Many go to Mount Meru on the occasion of the birth festivals of the Tirthankaras, etc., and to the mountains of Anjana, Dadhimukha, etc., on the occasion of the eight-day festivals, and many go to Mandara, etc., for play. But all of these are few, therefore the fewest lords of the mansions are in the upper realm. 1. Prajñāpanā. Malaya. Vṛtti, pages 146 to 148.

[274] There are innumerable times more [भवनपतिदेव] in the two realms called the upper realm and the realm of the transmigratory beings, compared to those who are only in the upper realm, because the [भवनपतिदेव] who are in the realm of the transmigratory beings, when they perform the act of [वैक्रिय समुद्घात], they touch the upper realm and the realm of the transmigratory beings. And those [भवनपतिदेव] who are in the realm of the transmigratory beings, when they perform the act of [मारणान्तिक समुद्घात] and are born in the upper realm in the heavenly realms of [सौधर्मादि], in the form of [बादरपर्याप्त पृथ्वीकायिक], [बादरपर्याप्त अप्कायिक], and [बादरपर्याप्त बनस्पतिकायिक], or in the forms of [शुभमणि], they experience the lifespan of their own birth, not the lifespan of the [पारभविक पृथ्वीकायिकादि]. At that time, they are called [भवनपतिदेव], and they touch the upper realm and the realm of the transmigratory beings. In this way, these [भवनपतिदेव] touch the aforementioned two realms because they travel to and from the upper realm, and because their playground is near both realms. Therefore, they are innumerable times more than the aforementioned gods. Compared to these, the [भवनपतिदेव] who touch the three realms are a countable number. Those who are born in the upper realm in the form of [तिर्यञ्चपंचेन्द्रिय भवनपति], when they perform the act of [वैक्रिय समुद्घात] or [मारणान्तिक समुद्घात] in their own place with special effort, they touch the three realms. They are a countable number because those who perform the act of [समुद्घात] in their own place are a countable number compared to those who perform it in other places. Compared to these, there are innumerable times more in the two realms called the lower realm and the realm of the transmigratory beings. Because the realm of the transmigratory beings is close to their own place, they travel to and from it, and even while staying in their own place, due to the act of [समुद्घात] caused by passions like anger, many [भवनपतिदेव] touch the aforementioned two realms. Compared to these, there are innumerable times more in the realm of the transmigratory beings, because they come to the realm of the transmigratory beings to pay homage during the [तीर्थंकर समवसरणादि], to play in the beautiful islands, and when they come, they stay for a long time. Compared to these, there are innumerable times more in the lower realm, because the lower realm is the place of the [भवनवासी]. The number of [भवनवासीदेवियाँ] should be understood to be slightly less than the [भवनवासीदेव]. 

Considering the separate number of [व्यन्तरदेव] and [व्यन्तरदेवियाँ] in different areas, the [व्यन्तरदेव] are the fewest in the upper realm. Only a few [व्यन्तरदेव] are found in [पाण्डकवन] etc. Compared to these, there are innumerable times more in the two realms called the upper realm and the realm of the transmigratory beings. Some [व्यन्तरदेव] touch the aforementioned two realms because they are within their own place, some because they are near their own place, and many because they travel to and from [मेरु] etc. Considering all of them collectively, they become very numerous. Compared to these, the [व्यन्तरदेव] who touch the three realms are a countable number, because they touch the three realms from their own places by performing the act of [वैक्रिय समुद्घात] with special effort. Such [व्यन्तरदेव] are more numerous than the aforementioned gods, therefore they are a countable number. Compared to these, there are innumerable times more in the two realms called the lower realm and the realm of the transmigratory beings, because these two realms are the places of many [व्यन्तरदेव], therefore the [व्यन्तरदेव] who touch them are very numerous, hence innumerable. Compared to these, they are a countable number in the lower realm, because their place is in the villages of the lower realm, and many [व्यन्तरदेव] also travel to the lower realm for play. Compared to these, they are a countable number more in the realm of the transmigratory beings, because the realm of the transmigratory beings is their own place. In the same way, the number of [व्यन्तरदेवियाँ] should be understood to be slightly less. 

Considering the separate number of [ज्योतिष्कदेव] and [ज्योतिष्कदेवियाँ] in different areas, the [ज्योतिष्कदेव] are the fewest in the upper realm, because only a few [ज्योतिष्कदेव] travel to the upper realm for the occasion of the [तीर्थंकरजन्ममहोत्सव], or for the [अष्टाह्निका] on [अंजन-दधिमुखादि], or some gods travel to [मन्दराचलादि] for play. Compared to these, there are innumerable times more in the two realms called the upper realm and the realm of the transmigratory beings. In those two realms...

[The Third Multi-Statement Difficulty] [275 Many Jyotishkadeva reside in their own abodes, some touch them by performing Vaikriya Samudghat from their own abodes, some touch them while going to and from the Upper World / Therefore, those who touch both the abodes are countless times more than the Devas residing in the Upper World. The Jyotishkadeva who are spread throughout the three worlds are many times more in number than them, because those Jyotishkadeva who perform Vaikriya Samudghat with intense effort, touch all three worlds from their own abodes; they are naturally very numerous, therefore the aforementioned Devas are many times more in number. The Jyotishkadeva who touch the two abodes of the Lower World and the Diagonal World are countless times more than them; because many Devas go to and from the Lower World for the purpose of Samavasarana or for playing in the Lower World, and many Devas are born in the Jyotishkadeva from the Lower World, then they touch the aforementioned two abodes. Therefore, these Devas are countless times more than the aforementioned Devas. They are many times more in number in the Lower World; because many Devas stay in the Lower World for a long time for the purpose of playing or for the purpose of Samavasarana in the Lower World villages. They are countless times more in the Diagonal World, because the Diagonal World is their abode. In the same way, the scarcity of Jyotishkadevi should also be considered. The scarcity of Vaimanika Devas and Devis should be considered separately according to the field. The least number of Vaimanika Devas are in the two abodes called the Upper World and the Diagonal World, because the beings who are born in the Vaimanika from the Lower World and the Diagonal World, and those Vaimanika who go to and fro in the Diagonal World, and those who reside in the play-places located in the aforementioned two abodes, and those who perform Vaikriya Samudghat or Maranantik Samudghat while residing in the Diagonal World, they, by special effort, take their own abodes in the upward direction, then they touch the aforementioned two abodes, such Vaimanika Devas are very few, therefore the least number of Vaimanika Devas are in the aforementioned two abodes. They are many times more in number than the Vaimanika who are spread throughout the three worlds, according to the aforementioned method / They are many times more in number in the two abodes called the Lower World and the Diagonal World, because their going to and fro in the Lower World villages for the purpose of Tirthankara Samavasarana, etc., and their staying in the Samavasarana, etc., in the aforementioned two abodes, causes many Devas to touch the aforementioned two abodes, they are many times more in number in the Lower World and the Diagonal World, respectively, according to the aforementioned method, many Devas have Samavasarana, etc., and stay in the play-places in both. They are countless times more in number in the Upper World, because the Upper World is their abode, it is natural for them to be very numerous there. The scarcity of Vaimanika Devis should also be understood like the Deva Sutra. According to the field, the scarcity of Ekendriya, etc., beings should be considered separately - (1) The scarcity of Ekendriya beings - When considering the scarcity of Ekendriya, Ekendriya Apariaptka and Ekendriya Pariaptka beings according to the field, they are the least in the two abodes called the Upper World and the Diagonal World. Many Ekendriya beings reside there. Many who are born from the Upper World to the Diagonal World and from the Diagonal World to the Upper World, when they perform Maranantik Samudghat, they touch the aforementioned two abodes, they are very few, therefore they are said to be the least in the aforementioned two abodes. They are more numerous in the Lower World and the Diagonal World, because the Ekendriya who are born from the Lower World to the Diagonal World or from the Diagonal World to the Lower World by Ilikagati, touch the aforementioned two abodes / The Ekendriya who reside there are also more numerous in the Upper World than in the Lower World, they are 1.

---------------------------
[276] The *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* also states that there are more living beings born in the *tiryagloka* from the *adholoka* than in the *adholoka* itself. Therefore, the two *prataras* mentioned above are more numerous. Compared to them, there are countless times more *ekendriya* beings in the *tiryagloka*, because the *tiryagloka* is countless times larger than the area of the two *prataras*. Compared to them, there are countless times more *trailokya-sparshi* beings. This is because many *ekendriya* beings are born in the *adholoka* from the *urdhvaloka* and in the *urdhvaloka* from the *adholoka*, and many of them, due to *māraṇāntika-samudghāta*, extend their *ātma-pradeśa* punishments to touch all three realms, making them countless in number. Compared to them, there are countless times more beings in the *urdhvaloka*, because the area of rebirth is vast. Compared to them, there are more beings in the *adholoka*, because the area of the *adholoka* is larger than that of the *urdhvaloka*. The same understanding should be applied to *ekendriya* beings who are *aparāptaka* and *parāptaka*. (2) When considering the relative abundance of *dvīndriya*, *trīndriya*, and *caturindriya* beings who are *aparāptaka* and *parāptaka*, the fewest *dvīndriya* beings are found in the *urdhvaloka*, because *śaṅkha* and other *dvīndriya* beings are only found in the *vāpī* and other places at the peak of Mount Meru in the *urdhvaloka*. Compared to them, there are countless times more beings in the two *prataras* known as the *urdhvaloka-tiryagloka*, because those who are born in the *tiryagloka* from the *urdhvaloka* or in the *urdhvaloka* from the *tiryagloka* as *dvīndriya* beings, experiencing the *dvīndriya-āyu*, and born through *ilikā-gati*, or those who are born in the *tiryagloka* from the *urdhvaloka* or in the *urdhvaloka* from the *tiryagloka* as *dvīndriya* beings or in any other form, who have previously committed *māraṇāntika-samudghāta*, and therefore are experiencing the *dvīndriya-āyu*, and who have extended their *ātma-pradeśas* far and wide due to *samudghāta*, and who are residing in the area controlled by the two *prataras*, such beings touch the two *prataras*, and they are very numerous, hence they are said to be countless times more than the previous ones. Compared to them, there are countless times more *trailokya-sparshi* *dvīndriya* beings, because there are many places of birth for *dvīndriya* beings in the *adholoka*, and even more in the *tiryagloka*. Among them, those who are born in the *urdhvaloka* from the *adholoka* as *dvīndriya* beings or in any other form, who have previously committed *māraṇāntika-samudghāta*, they extend their *ātma-pradeśas* to their place of birth due to *samudghāta*, and experience the *dvīndriya-āyu*, and those who are born in the *adholoka* from the *urdhvaloka* as *dvīndriya* beings or with other bodies, experiencing the *dvīndriya-āyu*, they are *trailokya-sparshi* and very numerous, hence they are countless times more than the previous ones. Compared to them, there are countless times more beings in the two *prataras* of the *adholoka-tiryagloka*, according to the previous explanation. Compared to them, there are countless times more beings in the *adholoka* and *tiryagloka*, in a progressive order. Just as it has been said that there are more *dvīndriya* beings and fewer *trīndriya* and *caturindriya* beings, so too should one consider the relative abundance of *aparāptaka* and *parāptaka* beings of all these categories. When considering the relative abundance of *pañcendriya* beings in different areas, the fewest *pañcendriya* beings are *trailokya-samsparshi*, because they are the only *pañcendriya* beings who touch all three realms, those who are born in the *adholoka* from the *urdhvaloka* or in the *urdhvaloka* from the *adholoka*, experiencing the *pañcendriya-āyu*, and born through *ilikā-gati*, or those who are born in the *adholoka* from the *urdhvaloka* or in the *urdhvaloka* from the *adholoka* as *pañcendriya* beings or in any other form, who have committed *māraṇāntika-samudghāta*, and who have extended their *ātma-pradeśas* to their place of birth at the time of *samudghāta*, and who experience the *pañcendriya-āyu*. They are very few, hence they are said to be the fewest. Compared to them,

## Third Multiplicity of Statements [277]

The number of beings in the upper and intermediate realms is greater than in the lower and intermediate realms, because there are more beings who touch these two realms through rebirth or migration. The number of beings in the lower and intermediate realms is greater than in the upper realm, because there are more beings who touch these two realms through intense rebirth or migration. The number of beings in the upper realm is greater than in the lower realm, because there are the abodes of the Vaimanika Devas. The number of beings in the lower realm is greater than in the upper realm because there are the abodes of the Nairyaika Devas. The number of beings in the intermediate realm is countless times greater than in the lower realm, because there is an abundance of Sammucchima, aquatic, aerial, etc., beings, as well as Vyantara and Jyotishka Devas, and Sammucchima humans. In the same way, one should consider the scarcity of beings with five senses.

Beings with five senses are the fewest in the upper realm, because there are mostly Vaimanika Devas residing there. The number of beings in the upper and intermediate realms is countless times greater than in the lower realm, because there is movement and interaction between the Jyotishka Devas, Vyantara Devas, and five-sensed beings in the intermediate realm, and the Vaimanika, Vyantara, Jyotishka, and Vidyaadhara-Chaarana-Munis, and five-sensed beings in the intermediate realm, in the upper and intermediate realms. Therefore, these two realms are touched. The number of beings who touch all three realms is greater than in the upper and intermediate realms, because when the Bhavanapati, Vaana Vyantara, Jyotishka, and Vaimanika Devas, and the Vidyaadhara Devas in the lower realm, perform special efforts and migrate with great force, and expand their realms in the upper realm, they touch all three realms. Therefore, they are said to be in the category of "multiplicity." The number of beings in the lower and intermediate realms is greater than those who touch all three realms. Many Vyantara Devas, being close to their own realm, touch the Bhavanapati, intermediate realm, or upper realm, because the Vyantara, Jyotishka, and Vaimanika Devas in the lower realm, interact with the villages in the lower realm, or travel for play in the lower realm. Also, some five-sensed beings in the intermediate realm are close to their own realm, and some five-sensed beings in the intermediate realm reside there, therefore, these two realms are touched. Therefore, they are said to be in the category of "multiplicity." The number of beings in the lower realm is greater than in the lower and intermediate realms, because there are the abodes of the Nairyaika and Bhavanapati Devas. The number of beings in the intermediate realm is countless times greater than in the lower realm, because there are the abodes of five-sensed beings in the intermediate realm, humans, Jyotishka, and Vyantara Devas.

The scarcity of the five stationary beings, starting with the Earth-bodied beings, should be understood separately. The technical, insufficient, and sufficient beings of the Earth-bodied beings, etc., total 15 categories. The scarcity mentioned in these 15 categories should be understood according to the previously mentioned one-sensed beings. The scarcity of beings with a body should be understood in the same way as the five-sensed beings, for the technical, insufficient, and sufficient beings with three bodies.

## Twenty-Fifth Bond Door: Scarcity of Beings Bound by the Karma of Lifespan

325. "Thus, Venerable Sir! Of the beings, which are bound by the taste of karma, which are managers, which are born, which are not born, which are asleep, which are awake, which are confused, which are not confused, which have knowledge of the senses, which do not have knowledge of the senses, which are householders, which are not householders, which are many, which are few, which are equal, which are different?"

[278] [Pramapanasutra Goyama!  All beings are bound by the karma of lifespan 1, those with insufficient merit are numerous 2, those who are asleep are numerous 3, those who are violent are numerous 4, those who experience the seven types of pain are numerous 5, those who are endowed with senses are numerous 6, those who are suitable for the formless are numerous 7, those who are suitable for the form are numerous 8, those who are not endowed with senses are special 9, those who do not experience the seven types of pain are special 10, those who are not violent are special 11, those who are awake are special 12, those with sufficient merit are special 13, those who are not bound by the karma of lifespan are special 14 / Door 25 / / [325 Pra.] Bhagavan!  Among these beings bound and unbound by the karma of lifespan, those with sufficient and insufficient merit, those who are asleep and awake, those who are violent and not violent, those who experience the seven types of pain and those who do not, those who are endowed with senses and those who are not, those who are suitable for the form and those who are suitable for the formless, which are fewer, which are more, which are equal, and which are special?  [325 U.] Gautama! 1. The beings bound by the karma of lifespan are the fewest, 2. (compared to them) those with insufficient merit are numerous, 3. (compared to them) those who are asleep are numerous, 4. (compared to them) those who are violent are numerous, 5. (compared to them) those who experience the seven types of pain are numerous, 6. (compared to them) those who are endowed with senses are numerous, 7. (compared to them) those who are suitable for the formless are numerous, 8. (compared to them) those who are suitable for the form are numerous, 9. (compared to them) those who are not endowed with senses are special, 10. (compared to them) those who do not experience the seven types of pain are special, 11. (compared to them) those who are not violent are special, 12. (compared to them) those who are awake are special, 13. (compared to them) those with sufficient merit are special, 14. (and compared to them) those who are not bound by the karma of lifespan are special. The twenty-fifth (bond) door // 25 / / Discussion - The two hundred and fiftieth bond door - This sutra (325) presents the relative scarcity of beings bound and unbound by the karma of lifespan, those with sufficient and insufficient merit, those who are asleep and awake, those who are violent and not violent, those who experience the seven types of pain and those who do not, those who are endowed with senses and those who are not, and those who are suitable for the form and those who are suitable for the formless. Explanation of scarcity - Beings bound by the karma of lifespan are the fewest because the time of binding by the karma of lifespan is fixed and short / When one-third of the lifespan of the experienced being remains, or even one-third of that one-third, etc., the being binds the lifespan of the next birth / Therefore, two-thirds are the time of non-binding and one-third is the time of binding, and that time of binding is also a very short period. Those with insufficient merit are said to be numerous compared to those bound by the karma of lifespan / Those who are asleep are more numerous than those with insufficient merit, because those who are asleep are found among both those with sufficient and insufficient merit, and those with sufficient merit are more numerous than those with insufficient merit. Those who are violent (those who commit violence) are more numerous than those who are asleep, because many beings with sufficient and insufficient merit are found to be constantly committing violence that leads to death. Those who experience the seven types of pain are more numerous than those who are violent; because even among those bound by lifespan, those with insufficient merit, and those who are asleep, those who experience the seven types of pain are found. Those who are endowed with senses are more numerous than those who experience the seven types of pain, because those who use their senses are found not only among those who experience the seven types of pain but also among those who do not. Compared to them,

## Third Multiplicity of Statements

**[279]** Both [types of] non-form usage are found.  There are more beings with form usage than those with non-form usage, because the time period of form usage is greater than that of non-form usage.

Beings with nine-sense usage are more special than those with form usage, because they include both nine-sense usage and non-form usage.  Beings with non-perceivable knowledge are more special than those with nine-sense usage, because beings with sense usage also have non-perceivable knowledge.

Beings with non-interrupted [karma] are more special than those with non-perceivable knowledge, because beings with perceivable knowledge also have non-interrupted [karma].  Therefore, beings with non-interrupted [karma] are more special.

Beings with awakened [consciousness] are more special than those with non-interrupted [karma], because some beings with interrupted [karma] are also awakened.  Beings with sufficient [karma] are more special than those with awakened [consciousness], because some beings with dormant [consciousness] also have sufficient [karma].  Many beings are sufficient even while being dormant, i.e., not awakened.  Those who are awakened are sufficient, but this is not the case for dormant beings.

Beings who manage the lifespan karma are more special than those with sufficient [karma], because beings with insufficient [karma] also manage lifespan karma.

**Each pair has a small minority:**

**(1)** Beings bound by lifespan karma are fewer, those who manage it are countless times more.  According to the aforementioned logic, the time period of management is greater than the time period of binding.  The time period of binding is only one-third, and that too only for a brief moment.  Therefore, those who manage are countless times more than those who are bound.

**(2)** Beings with insufficient [karma] are few, those with sufficient [karma] are countless times more.  This statement should be understood in relation to subtle beings, because in subtle beings, due to the absence of external obstacles, there is a greater proportion of beings who are born and a smaller proportion who are not born.

**(3)** Dormant beings are few, awakened beings are countless times more.  This statement should be understood in relation to subtle beings with one sense, because beings with insufficient [karma] are found to be dormant, while those with sufficient [karma] are also awakened.

**(4)** Beings with interrupted [karma] are few, beings with non-interrupted [karma] are countless times more.  Here, beings with interrupted [karma] are taken as those who have experienced the final interruption, and the final interruption occurs only at the time of death, not at other times.  Also, not all beings experience it.  Therefore, beings with interrupted [karma] are said to be few, while those with non-interrupted [karma] are more, because their lifespan is longer.

**(5)** Similarly, beings with perceivable knowledge are few, because beings with ordinary bodies are many, and beings with each body are few.  Most beings with ordinary bodies have non-perceivable knowledge, therefore, those with perceivable knowledge are few.  Among beings with each body, there is a majority of those with perceivable knowledge and a minority of those with non-perceivable knowledge.  Therefore, beings with perceivable knowledge are few and those with non-perceivable knowledge are countless times more.

**(6)** Beings with sense usage are few, those with nine-sense usage are countless times more, because sense usage is only related to the present, therefore, its time period is short.  Nine-sense usage is also related to the past and future.  Therefore, its time period is long, hence, beings with nine-sense usage are said to be countless times more.

**(7)** Due to the short time period of non-form [perception] usage, beings with non-form usage are few.  Because the time period of form usage is countless times greater, beings with form usage are countless times more.

## Third Multiple Statement [283 - 332 U.]

Gautama! 1. With respect to substance, the pudgalas with the least duration are one-time-duration pudgalas, 2. (compared to them) pudgalas with a countable duration are countable times the substance, 3. (compared to them) pudgalas with an uncountable duration are uncountable times the substance.

With respect to regions, the least numerous - 1. The pudgalas with the least duration, one-time-duration pudgalas, are with respect to regions, 2. (compared to them) pudgalas with a countable duration are countable times the regions, 3. (compared to them) pudgalas with an uncountable duration are uncountable times the regions.

With respect to substance and region, the least numerous - 1. The pudgalas with the least duration, one-time-duration pudgalas, are with respect to substance and region, 2. pudgalas with a countable duration are countable times the substance, 3. (compared to them) they (pudgalas with a countable duration) are countable times the regions, 4. (compared to them) pudgalas with an uncountable duration are uncountable times the substance, 5. (and compared to them) they (pudgalas with an uncountable duration) are uncountable times the regions.

333. Thus, venerable sir! Among these one-time-duration pudgalas, countable-time-duration pudgalas, uncountable-time-duration pudgalas, and infinite-time-duration pudgalas, with respect to substance, with respect to regions, and with respect to substance and regions, which are less, more, equal, or superior?

333 U.] Gautama! Just as it has been said about the atomic pudgalas (Su. 330), so it should be said here. Similarly, with respect to countable-time-duration pudgalas (and uncountable-time-duration pudgalas and infinite-time-duration pudgalas), it should be understood (as per Su. 330). Similarly, with respect to the remaining colors (blue, red, yellow, etc.) and (all) odors and tastes (from one-time-duration to infinite-time-duration) pudgalas, it should be said about their least numerousness. And with respect to the rough, soft, heavy, and light touches (least numerousness), just as it has been said about one-region-dense, etc. (Su. 331), so it should be said here.

With respect to the remaining (four) touches, just as it has been said about the colors (least numerousness), so it should be said. Twenty-sixth (pudgal) gate // 26 //

**Discussion:** Twenty-sixth pudgal gate - In these eight sutras (Su. 326 to 333), through the pudgal gate, the least numerousness of pudgalas and substances with respect to region and direction, and the least numerousness of atomic pudgalas, countable-region pudgalas, etc. with respect to substance, region, and substance-region, from one-region-dense to uncountable-region-dense pudgalas, is discussed.

[284] The relative abundance of pudgalas from the Prajnapana Sutra to the innumerable time-periods and the various pudgalas of color, smell, taste, and touch has been considered. According to the region, the pudgalas are least abundant in the triloka. The pudgala dravya is said to be the least because only the mahas kandhas are triloka-spanning, and they are few. Compared to these, there are an infinite number of pudgala dravyas in the two prataras called the urdhvaloka and the tiryanchloka, because in these two prataras, there are an infinite number of pradeshi, an infinite number of asankhyata pradeshi, and an infinite number of ananta pradeshi kandhas that touch. Therefore, in terms of dravya, they are infinite. Compared to these, the two prataras called the adholoka and the tiryanchloka are more abundant, because their region is somewhat more abundant in terms of length and width. Compared to these, there are an innumerable number of pudgalas in the tiryanchloka, because its region is innumerable times larger (than the previous ones). Compared to these, there are an innumerable number of pudgalas in the urdhvaloka, because the region of the urdhvaloka is innumerable times larger than the region of the tiryanchloka. Compared to these, there are more abundant pudgala dravyas in the adholoka, because the region of the adholoka is somewhat larger than the region of the urdhvaloka. The urdhvaloka is slightly less than 7 rajju pramanas, while the adholoka is slightly more than 7 rajju pramanas. According to the directions, the least abundant pudgala dravya is in the upward direction, because in the middle of Mount Meru, which has a flat surface of the ratna prabha earth, there is an upward direction that is four pradeshas long and extends from the ruchka, which is eight pradeshas long, to the end of the loka. There are the fewest pudgalas in this direction. The downward direction also originates from the ruchka and is four pradeshas long and extends to the end of the loka, but it is somewhat more abundant than the upward direction, so there are more pudgalas there. Compared to these, there are an innumerable number of pudgalas in the northeast and southwest directions, each. In their own place, they are equal. Although these two directions originate from the ruchka and are shaped like a muktavali, they extend to the end of the tiryanchloka, adholoka, and urdhvaloka, so their region is innumerable times larger, and therefore there are an innumerable number of pudgalas there. Compared to these, there are more pudgalas in the southeast and northwest directions, each. In their own place, they are equal. The reason for the greater abundance of pudgalas in these directions is that there are many subtle pudgalas of fog, dew, etc., on the seven peaks of Mount Saumanas and Mount Gandhamadana, and on the nine peaks of Mount Vidyutprabha and Mount Malyaavan. Therefore, there are more pudgalas in these two directions than in the previously mentioned directions. Compared to these, there are an innumerable number of pudgalas in the east direction, because the region in the east is innumerable times larger. Compared to these, there are more pudgalas in the west direction, because there are many pudgalas there due to the presence of polars in the adholoka villages. Compared to the west, there are more pudgalas in the south direction, because there are more buildings and polars there. Compared to these, there are more pudgalas in the north direction, because in the north there is the Manasarovar lake, which is countless kotis of yojanas long and wide, and there are many aquatic animals, algae, and other creatures there. The pudgalas of their tejas and karma bodies are found in abundance. For this reason, it is said that there are more pudgalas in the north than in the west. In general, according to the region, the least abundant dravya is the triloka. Because of the dharma astikaya, adharma astikaya, and akasha astikaya, the mahas kandhas, and the jiva astikaya, only the extremely concentrated jivas that are capable of causing death are triloka-spanning, and they are few. Therefore, they are the least abundant. Compared to these, there are an infinite number of dravyas in the two prataras called the urdhvaloka and the tiryanchloka. 1. Prajnapana Sutra Malaya.

[Third Multi-Statement Difficulty] [285 Because these two Prataras touch infinite Pudgala-dravya and infinite Jiva-dravya. In comparison to these two Prataras, there are some more dravyas in the Prataras called Adholoka-tiryagloka / In comparison to them, there are innumerable times more dravyas in the Urddhvaloka, because that region is innumerable times vast / In comparison to them, there are infinite times more dravyas in the Adholoka, because in the Adholoka villages there is time, which is related to the synonyms of various atoms, Sankhyatpradeshi, Asankhyatpradeshi, Anantpradeshi dravya, kshetra, kala, bhava, due to which each atom etc. dravya is of infinite types / In comparison to the Adholoka, there are Sankhyatguna dravyas in the Tiryagloka, because the Adholoka villages are found in the Sankhyat in the Manushyaloka, which is the basis of the Khandakala-dravya. In comparison to the directions, in general, the dravyas are less or more - in general, the least dravyas are in the Adhodisha, in comparison to them, there are infinite times more in the Urddhvadisha, because in the Urddhvaloka there is a five hundred yojana long crystal-like stem of Mount Meru, in which there is the light of the moon and the sun, and due to the participation of the dravyas in the moment etc. time, and due to the aforementioned policy, due to the time being infinite with each atom etc. dravyas, it is proved that the dravya is infinite times. In comparison to the Urddhvadisha, there are innumerable times more dravyas in the Uttarapurva-Isanakoon and Dakshinapaschim-Nairityakoon, because the regions there are innumerable times, but there are equal dravyas in both these directions, because the region of both is equal. In comparison to these two, there are more special dravyas in the Dakshinapurva-Agneyacoon and Uttarapaschim-Vayavyacoon, because in these directions, there are many smooth Pudgaladravya like fog, dew etc. dependent on the peaks of the mountains like Vidhyutprabha and Malya. In comparison to these, there are innumerable times more regions in the east direction, so the dravyas are also innumerable times more. In comparison to the east, there are more special dravyas in the west direction, because there are many Pudgaladravya in the Adholoka villages due to the presence of poles. In comparison to that, there are more special dravyas in the south, because there are holes (poles) in many Bhuvanas. There are more special dravyas in the north direction from the south, because there are many Tejas and Karman vargana Pudgalaskandha dravyas dependent on the Jivas living in Manasarovar. The less or more of Sankhyat-Asankhyat-Anantpradeshi-Paramanupudgalas - In the present sutras, the less or more has been considered from the point of view of dravya, pradesh and dravya-pradesh / The text is easy / Here, the nature of the Pudgalas is considered as the reason in the feeling of less or more everywhere. The less or more of Pudgalas due to the predominance of the region - The Pudgalas (in relation to dravya) are the least in one pradesh (located in one pradesh of the sky) / Here, the consideration has been done from the predominance of the region / Therefore, whatever atoms, Sankhyatpradeshi, Asankhyatpradeshi and Anantpradeshi skandha are located in one pradesh of the sky, all of them are counted in one amount and called 'Ekpradeshavagaadh'. From this point of view, the Sankhyatpradeshavagaadh Pudgalas are Sankhyatguna in relation to the dravya of the aforementioned / It should be kept in mind here that in two pradeshes of the sky, there is also Dwayanuk, Vyanyuk and Asankhyatpradeshi or Anantpradeshi skandha, but in relation to the region, all of them have the same amount / Similarly, in three pradeshes, from Jyanyuk to Anantaanuk skandha are there, their amount should also be understood.

## 286] [Prajñāpanasūtra]  The pudgala dravya, which is tri-pradeśa-avagāḍha, is many times more than the pudgala dravya, which is tri-pradeśa-avagāḍha, in the same way, the pudgala dravya, which is catur-pradeśa-avagāḍha, is many times more than the pudgala dravya, which is tri-pradeśa-avagāḍha, and the pudgala dravya, which is pañca-pradeśa-avagāḍha, is many times more than the pudgala dravya, which is catur-pradeśa-avagāḍha, and so on, the pudgala dravya, which is saṅkhyāta-pradeśa-avagāḍha, is many times more than the pudgala dravya, which is pañca-pradeśa-avagāḍha.  Compared to these, the pudgala dravya, which is asaṅkhyāta-pradeśa-avagāḍha, is asaṅkhyāta times more, because there are asaṅkhyāta types of asaṅkhyāta.  /  Similarly, the dravya-ārthata-sūtra, pradeśa-ārthata-sūtra, and dravya-pradeśa-ārthata-sūtra should be understood everywhere, as they are easy to understand.  _  From the perspective of time and form, the alpa-bahutva of pudgalas should be understood as follows:  From the perspective of time, the alpa-bahutva of pudgalas, which exist from one moment to infinite moments, should be understood appropriately.  /  From the perspective of form, the alpa-bahutva of the five colors, two smells, five tastes like bitter, pungent, etc., and the four touches like cold, hot, oily, and rough, should be understood as being the same as the color mentioned in the original text.  /  The alpa-bahutva of the pudgalas, which are of one guna, should be described like the general pudgalas.  For example:  1. The least number of ananta-pradeśī skandhas are of one guna and are black.  2. Compared to dravya, the paramaṇu-pudgalas are ananta times more than the one guna black pudgalas, (from them) the saṅkhyāta-pradeśī skandhas are saṅkhyāta times more than the one guna black pudgalas, and from them, the asaṅkhyāta-pradeśī skandhas are asaṅkhyāta times more than the one guna black pudgalas.  /  Similarly, it should be understood from the perspective of pradeśa.  /  The alpa-bahutva of each of the four touches, rough, soft, heavy, and light, should be understood as being the same as the one pradeśa-avagāḍha.  /  For example:  The one pradeśa-avagāḍha one guna rough touch pudgalas are the least in terms of dravya-ārthata, from them, the saṅkhyāta-pradeśa-avagāḍha one guna rough touch pudgalas are saṅkhyāta times more in terms of dravya-ārthata, from them, the asaṅkhyāta-pradeśa-avagāḍha one guna rough touch pudgalas are asaṅkhyāta times more in terms of dravya-ārthata, and so on.  /  Similarly, it should be understood regarding the alpa-bahutva of the saṅkhyāta-guna rough touch, asaṅkhyāta-guna rough touch, and ananta-guna rough touch.'

**290]** The Tejaskaayik Paryaptak are innumerable times more than the Asankhyeyaguṇe, because they are a fraction of the time-measure of the Aavalikadhan. (4) The Anuttaroppaapatiik Dev are innumerable times more than them, because they are equal to the number of sky-regions in the fraction of the Asankhyaatavēn of the Kshetrapalyopam. (5) The Dev of the Uparitan Graiveyakatrik are innumerable times more than them, because they are equal to the number of sky-regions in the fraction of the Asankhyaatavēn of the Brihattar Kshetrapalyopam. The measure to know this is the increase in the successive Vimanas. (The Anuttar Dev have 5 Vimanas, but the three upper Veyaks have a hundred Vimanas, and each Vimana has innumerable Dev. The lower Vimanas have more and more Dev, therefore the Dev of the three upper Veyaks are innumerable times more than the Anuttaravimana Dev. Further, the Dev of the Anatkalapa (6 to 11) are successively innumerable times more, the reason for which has been explained earlier. (Although the Aaran and Achyut Kalpas are in the same category and both have the same number of Vimanas, by nature, the Krishnapakshi Jivas are mostly born in the south direction, not in the north direction, and the Krishnapakshi Jivas are more than the Shuklapakshi Jivas. Therefore, the Dev of the Anatkalapa are successively innumerable times more than the Aaran and Achyut Kalpas. (12) The Nairyaik of the seventh Narakprithvi are innumerable times more than them, because they are equal to the number of sky-regions in the fraction of the Asankhyaatavēn of the category. Successively, from them, (13) the Narak of the sixth Narak, (14) the Dev of the Sahasraarkalapa, (15) the Dev of the Mahashukrakalpa, (16) the Narak of the fifth Dhumpabha Narak, (17) the Dev of the Laantakkalapa, (18) the Narak of the fourth Pankaprabhanarak, (19) the Dev of the Brahmalokakalapa, (20) the Narak of the third Balakapabha Narak, (21) the Dev of the Kalapa, (22) the Dev of the Sanatkumarakalapa, (23) the Narak of the second Sharkarapabha Narak are innumerable times more. If the Narak from the seventh Prithvi to the second Prithvi are categorized in their respective places, then all of them are equal to the number of sky-regions in the fraction of the Asankhyaatavēn of the Dhanikrit Lokashreni, but there are innumerable variations in the fraction of the Asankhyaatavēn of the category. Therefore, there is no contradiction in saying that there is a gradual decrease in the number of these, which is innumerable times more. The rest of the arguments should be understood in the same way. (24) The Sammuchhim Manusya are innumerable times more than them, because the number of Sammuchhim Manusya is equal to the number of regions in the third square root multiplied by the second square root of the number of regions in an Angulmaatrak Kshetra. (25) The Ishanakalapa Dev are innumerable times more than them, this should be understood according to the previously mentioned argument. (26) The Dev of the Ishanakalapa are innumerable times more than them, because the Devi are thirty-two times more than the Dev. (27) The Dev of the Saudharmakalpa are innumerable times more than them, because there are twenty-eight lakh Vimanas in the Ishanakalapa, while there are thirty-two lakh Vimanas in the Saudharmakalpa. (28) According to the previously mentioned argument, the Devi of the Saudharmakalpa are innumerable times more than the Dev, because they are thirty-two times more than the Dev. (29) The Bhavanavaasi Dev are innumerable times more than them. The number of Bhavanapati Dev and Devi is equal to the number of sky-regions in a category of the Dhanikrit Lok, which is equal to the number of regions in the first square root multiplied by the third square root of the number of regions in an Angulmaatrak Kshetra. (30) The Devi are thirty-two times more than the Dev, therefore the Bhavanavaasi Devi are innumerable times more. (31) The 1. (a) 'Battisiguna Battisaruvahia U Honti Deviyo.'

English translation preserving Jain terms:

The Tirthankaras of the Ratnaprabha Prithvi (Jewel-Radiant Earth) have Asankhyatguna (innumerable times) more Naraka (hell beings) than us. They reside in a number of Akashapradesa (space-points) equal to the square root of the second power of the number of Pradesa (spatial units) in an area of just one Angula (finger-breadth).

Compared to them, the Khechara (celestial) Pancendriya-Tiryañca (five-sensed animals) have Asankhyatguna more beings, as they reside in a number of Akashapradesa equal to the Asankhyatva (innumerability) part of the Pratara (higher division).

Compared to the Khechara Pancendriya-Tiryañca, the Khechara Pancendriya-Tiryañca Stri (females) are Sankhyatguna (countably more) because the females among the Tiryañca are three times and three more than the males.

Compared to them, the Sthalachara (terrestrial) Pancendriya-Tiryañca-Yonika Purusa (males) are Sankhyatguna, as they reside in a number of Akashapradesa equal to the Asankhyatva part of the greater Pratara.

Compared to them, the Sthalachara Pancendriya-Tiryañca Stri are Sankhyatguna by the above logic.

Compared to them, the Jalachara (aquatic) Pancendriya-Tiryañca Purusa are Sankhyatguna more, as they reside in a number of Akashapradesa equal to the Asankhyatva part of the greatest Pratara.

Compared to them, the Jalachara Pancendriya-Tiryañca Stri are Sankhyatguna by the above logic.

Compared to them, the Vyanantara Devas (demigods) and Devis (demigoddesses) are successively Sankhyatguna, as there are Sankhyat (countable) Khandas (divisions) in one Pratara, equal to the number of common Vyanantara Devas, and the Devis are 32 times and 32 more than the Devas.

Compared to them, the Jyotishka Devas (including Devis) are Sankhyatguna more, as they are generally equal in number to the 256 Angula-sized Khandas in one Pratara.

According to the above logic, the Jyotishka Devis are Sankhyatguna compared to the Jyotishka Devas.

Compared to them, the Paryapta Chaturindriya (four-sensed complete) are Sankhyatguna, as they are equal in number to the Asankhyatva part of one Angula.

Compared to them, the Sthalachara Pancendriya-Tiryañca Napumsaka (neuters), Jalachara Pancendriya-Tiryañca Napumsaka, and Chaturindriya Paryaptaka are successively Sankhyatguna.

Compared to them, the Pancendriya Paryaptaka, Dvindriya Paryaptaka, Trindriya Paryaptaka, Pancendriya Aparyaptaka, Chaturindriya Aparyaptaka, Trindriya Aparyaptaka, and Dvindriya Aparyaptaka are successively specially more, as they are equal in number to the Asankhyatva part of one Angula, but there are Asankhyat divisions of the Asankhyatva part of an Angula. Therefore, there is no defect in taking the Asankhyatva part of an Angula down to the Aparyapta Dvindriya.

Each Badara (gross) Vanaspatikayika Paryaptaka, Badara Nigoda Paryaptaka, Badara Prithvikayika Paryaptaka, Badara Apkayika Paryaptaka, Badara Vayukayika Paryaptaka, Badara Tejaskayika Aparyaptaka, Badara Vanaspatikayika Aparyaptaka, Badara Nigoda Aparyaptaka, Badara Prithvikayika Aparyaptaka, Badara Apkayika Aparyaptaka, Badara Vayukayika Aparyaptaka, and Sukshma Tejaskayika Aparyaptaka are successively Asankhyatguna. Compared to them, the Sukshma Vayukayika Aparyaptaka, Sukshma Apkayika Aparyaptaka, and Sukshma Vayukayika Aparyaptaka are successively specially more, and the Sukshma Tejaskayika Paryaptaka are Sankhyatguna compared to them, as per the above logic. And the Paryaptaka Sukshma beings are naturally 1.

This fourth chapter of the *Prajnapana Sutra* considers the duration of the existence (position or staying) of living beings in the various states, such as hell, etc., from birth to death. In other words, this chapter considers the lifespan of the various states of living beings, such as hell, animal, human, and god. Although the living substance (soul) is eternal, the various forms (various births) it takes are impermanent. They are bound to perish at some point. Therefore, it is necessary to consider their position. This is the fact presented here. The etymological meaning of the word 'position' is also of this nature - the position is the (state) in which the living being resides while experiencing the karmic consequences. Therefore, position, lifespan-karma-experience, and life are all synonymous terms. Although the position of the karmic particles, which are taken due to false belief, etc., and transformed into knowledge-obscuring, etc., is also known as 'position', here the 'lifespan-karma-experience' is the meaning of the word 'position' for the purpose of designating hell, etc. Because the states of hell, etc., are called hell, etc., due to the arising of the name-karma, such as the five-sense-being, etc. But here, a living being who has not attained the hell, etc., is called hell, etc., from the time of the first sensation of the hell-lifespan, etc. Therefore, the experience of the lifespan-karma of that particular state is considered to be the position. Only worldly beings experience the limit (praaya) of lifespan-karma, therefore, this chapter considers the position of worldly beings only. Siddhas, etc., are without any limit, therefore, their lifespan is not considered because it is not attainable. And the position of the states of non-living substance is also not considered in this chapter because the states of non-living beings are not dependent on the experience of lifespan like living beings, and their states cannot be determined within a certain limit in terms of time like the lifespan of living beings. The consideration of position (lifespan) here is done in two ways: inferior and superior. The order of the instruction of position in this chapter is as follows: first, considering the general states of the living being, then considering their sufficient and insufficient differences, and then considering the lifespan.

After that, the Paryāptadashā comes. Therefore, by subtracting the Antarmūhurta state of Aparyāptadashā from the general state, the remaining state becomes that of Paryāptakas.

* * The Fifth Special Chapter (Paryaya Chapter) This is the fifth special chapter or synonym chapter of the primary knowledge sutras. The word "special" has two meanings - (1) the special, i.e., type of substances like jiva and ajeeva, and (2) the special, i.e., synonym of substances like jiva and ajeeva. In the first chapter, the types of these two substances, jiva and ajeeva, along with their differences and sub-differences, have been explained. It has also been briefly repeated here (in sutras 436 and 500-501). This is because in this chapter, it is to be clarified that there are infinite synonyms for each of the types of jiva and ajeeva. If there are infinite synonyms for each, then there are infinite synonyms for all jivas or all ajeevas, what is there to say? Even though this chapter is named "Special Chapter", the word "special" is not used anywhere in the sutras of this chapter, the word "synonym" has been used for them throughout the chapter. In Jain scriptures, the word "synonym" has also been given more importance. From this, the author has indicated one thing - that there is no difference between synonym and special. All the different types of jivas or ajeevas that are seen are synonyms of the substance itself. Then, whether they are special types of the general or synonyms of the specific substance. The distinctions of naraka, etc., of jiva that have been explained, are all synonyms of that jiva substance, because from the beginningless time, jiva has been born in that form many times. Just as there are synonyms of one jiva, so all jivas have the same ability, so they have all taken birth in the form of naraka, tiryanch, etc. Thus, what is called type or distinction or special, is a synonym in relation to each jiva substance, it is a special state or result of jiva. In the present context, the word "synonym" has been used in two senses - (1) in the sense of type or distinction, and (2) in the sense of state or result. There are many distinctions or special types of naraka, etc., of the general jiva, therefore they have been called synonyms of jiva, and there are also many results or synonyms of the general jiva, therefore they have also been called synonyms of jiva. Similarly, one should understand in the case of ajeeva. Thus, the scholar has used the word "synonym" in two senses and has considered synonym and special to be synonymous. In Jain Agamas, the word "synonym" was prevalent, but in Vaisheshika Darshan, the word "special" started being used, therefore that word is used in the sense of synonym and object. 1. See, Tarka Sangraha and Vaisheshika Darshan.

Page #388:
---------------------------
## Fifth Special Term (Synonym): Primary

[355 can also have a different meaning, the Acharya may have named this term 'Special Term' to indicate this, it is also possible. * The scholars have used the word synonym to indicate that no substance is ever without a synonym / Every substance is in some state of synonym. What is called substance, is also introduced in the present term by the name of synonym. In short, there is no difference between substance and synonym, to convey this, the scholar has also used the word synonym for the type of substance (Su. 439, 501) / * Thus, even though substance and synonym are in some way inseparable, the scholar had to make it clear that there is also a difference between substance and synonym. All these synonyms or results are not of the same substance, this information has been given by stating the difference in the number of substances and the number of synonyms. For example, the scholar has said that the number of hell beings is innumerable (Su. 439), but the synonyms of hell beings are infinite. Of the many types of living beings, plants and Siddhas are the only two types whose number of substances is infinite. Therefore, from a holistic perspective, the living substance can be said to be infinite, but in those types, except for the aforementioned two, all substances are innumerable, not infinite. Nevertheless, the number of synonyms of all those types is infinite, this is clearly stated in this term. Like Vedanta philosophy, according to Jain philosophy, the living substance is not one, but infinite / This means that from this perspective, there is no independent entity (unit) like the general living being, but the conscious qualities that are seen in many living beings are the same, and they are diverse and are present in that particular living being, and those qualities are what differentiate the living being from the non-living. Therefore, even though they are many, they are called general because they perform the function of differentiating the living being from the non-living in the same way. This general is a transversal general which is subjective to many at one time / According to Jain philosophy, one substance transforms into many forms, for example, one living being (substance) takes on many results (synonyms) like hell beings etc. / These results change over time, but the living substance is permanent, it never perishes; it perishes in the form of hell beings etc. synonyms. Even while taking on many synonyms like hell beings etc., it never becomes unconscious. This living substance is called general-upward general, which is present in one individual over many periods of time, and the various synonyms-results or special or differences of that general. From this perspective, the general of individual differences is transversal general, while the general of temporal differences is upward general; which is known by the name of substance and is one and becomes the cause in the knowledge of non-difference, while the transversal general is many, and becomes the cause in the knowledge of sameness. The conclusion is that the general living being is transversal general in relation to many living beings, while it is upward general in relation to the various synonyms of the same living being. 1.

---------------------------
[356] In the same way, there is no single, separate entity called "Ajiva-dravya" (non-living substance), but rather there are many Ajiva (non-living) substances. They are all distinct from the Jiva (living being), and therefore, in that sense, their similarity (not unity, but unity in a certain respect) is expressed by the term "Ajiva-dravya." For this reason, it is a general Ajiva-dravya-tiryaksamanya (general non-living substance).  /  It should be understood that the synonyms, specifics, or distinctions of this Tiryaksamanya are the same as the synonyms, specifics, or distinctions of Jiva and Ajiva presented here.  /  In the case of worldly Jivas, the states that are created, based on which the Jiva is connected to Pudgalas (matter), lead to various states of the Jiva, which become its Paryayas (categories). These Pudgalik Paryayas are also considered as Paryayas of the Jiva from a practical standpoint. The description of the Paryayas of the Jiva is based on the assumption that in the worldly state, Jiva and Pudgala appear inseparable. Just as the infinite Paryayas of Pudgala are described (in Sutra 519) due to the diversity of color, smell, taste, and touch, independently, in the same way, when these same Pudgalas are connected to the Jiva, they are considered as Paryayas of the Jiva (in Sutra 440). This is because when they are connected to the Jiva, the Jiva is also a cause in the transformation that occurs in the Pudgala. Therefore, even though these Paryayas belong to the Pudgala, they are considered as Paryayas of the Jiva. In the worldly state, there is a certain inseparability between Jiva and Pudgala, which has been prevalent since time immemorial. It is due to the rise of Karma that there is diversity in the form, shape, etc., of Jivas, and the creation of various Paryayas.  /  Therefore, even though the Jiva is essentially of the nature of knowledge, etc., it is endowed with infinite Paryayas.  /  * This section deals with the distinctions and Paryayas of Jiva and Ajiva substances. While the first section dealt with the distinctions between Jiva and Ajiva, this fifth section specifically addresses the infinite Paryayas within each of these distinctions. The first section described the distinctions, the third section mentioned their number, but since the main focus of the third section was on the numerical difference, it did not specify the number of each specific distinction. Therefore, this section provides the number of each distinction and subsequently the number of Paryayas within each distinction. The number of Paryayas for all substance distinctions is infinite, but the number of distinctions themselves is finite, infinite, or even countless (in the case of plant-bodied beings and Siddha-Jivas). The Paryayas of the Jiva substance, such as those of the hell-bound beings, etc., have been considered from various perspectives and viewpoints, and the Jain philosophy's Anekanta (multifaceted) perspective is evident in them. For example, the description of the Paryayas of the Jiva's distinctions, such as hell-bound beings, etc., includes a relative description from the following ten perspectives. In other words, the number of Paryayas is mentioned from these ten perspectives to explain the infinite Paryayas of hell-bound beings, etc. From some perspectives, the number is finite, from others it is countless, and from still others it is infinite.  /  Keeping in mind the perspective of infinity, the author has called the Paryayas of each of the hell-bound beings, etc., infinite, because from that perspective, the maximum number of Paryayas occur. And the direct mention of those numbers is not done. 1. The phrases like "Ege Paya" in the "Sthananga Sutra" are based on assumed unity. 2. "Pannavanasutta" (Original Sutra 439, 591) 3. "Pannavana" (Original Sutra 440)

---------------------------
## Fifth Special Chapter (Synonyms): Primary [557]

**[557] Though the number is stated as one, it is determined by comparing one hell being with another. For example, the description of the ten perspectives is as follows:**

**(1) Dravyarthata:** From the perspective of dravya (substance), one hell being is equal to other hell beings. That is, in relation to dravya, one hell being is a dravya, just as another hell being is also a dravya. The conclusion is that any hell being is considered one from the perspective of dravya, its number is not more than one, therefore it is sankhyat (countable).

**(2) Pradesh-arthata:** From the perspective of pradesh (space), hell beings are also equal to each other. That is, just as the pradeshes of one hell being are countless, so are the pradeshes of other hell beings, neither less nor more.

**(3) Avgahan-arthata:** If considered from the perspective of avgahana (height of the body of the being), one hell being is inferior, equal, or superior to another hell being, and it is countless-countable part inferior-superior or countable-countless-fold inferior-superior. The conclusion is that from the perspective of avgahana, countless types of synonyms of hell beings are formed.

**(4) Sthiti:** The consideration from the perspective of sthiti (position) is similar to that of avgahana. That is, it is inferior-superior or equal in the aforementioned four ways. The conclusion is that from the perspective of sthiti, countless types of synonyms of hell beings are formed.

**(5-8) Krishnadi Varna, Gandha, Rasa, and Sparsha:** From the perspective of Krishnadi Varna (black, etc., color), Gandha (smell), Rasa (taste), and Sparsha (touch), countless synonyms of hell beings are formed. This is because it is possible to have one-fold Krishnadi Varna, Gandha, Rasa, and Sparsha, and also countless-fold Krishnadi Varna, Gandha, Rasa, and Sparsha. Thus, from the perspective of each type of these four, countless synonyms of hell beings can be formed, hence they are called countless synonyms.

**(9-10) Jnana and Darshan:** From the perspective of Jnana (knowledge/ignorance) and Darshan (perception), countless synonyms of hell beings exist, say the scholars. Acharya Malayagiri says, "These ten perspectives can be included in four perspectives. For example, Dravyarthata and Pradesh-arthata can be included in dravya, Avgahana in kshetra (field), Sthiti in kala (time), and Varnadi and Jnanadi in bhava (state)."

* In the same way, further considerations of the synonyms of the beings of the twenty-four dandakas are made by taking into account the inferior, superior, and medium avgahana, sthiti, Varnadi, and Jnanadi.

* After this, the two divisions of ajiva (non-living) - arupi ajiva (formless non-living) and rupa ajiva (formful non-living) - are considered. The rupa ajiva has four types: paramanu (atom), skandha (aggregate), skandhadesh (space of the aggregate), and skandhapradesh (space of the space of the aggregate). However, here, the synonyms of only two types are mainly described: paramanu-pudgala (non-soul particle) and skandha (aggregate of many atoms).

* The first chapter describes the pudgala (rupa ajiva), which transforms into various forms, while this chapter describes the number of synonyms of the mentioned rupa ajiva divisions. First, the number of synonyms of rupa ajiva is stated as countless in general, and then countless synonyms are stated for each of the following: paramanu, dvipradeshi skandha (two-space aggregate), tripradeshi skandha (three-space aggregate), up to dashapradeshi skandha (ten-space aggregate), sankhyatpradeshi skandha (countable-space aggregate), asankhyatpradeshi skandha (countless-space aggregate), and anantpradeshi skandha (infinite-space aggregate). The consideration of the synonyms of all these is similar to that of the jiva (living being), dravya,

---------------------------
The **Prajñāpanā Sūtra** has been explained from the perspectives of **kṣetra**, **kāla**, and **bhāva**, or the aforementioned ten viewpoints.  Describing the **paryāyas** from the **paramāṇu** to the **ananta-pradeśī pūdgala-skandha**, the **śāstrakāra** states that the **loka-ākāśa** is **asan-khyāta-pradeśī**, yet even the **ananta-pradeśī skandha** can fit within one to countless **pradeśas**. This is explained through the analogy of a lamp. Similarly, the position of **skandhas** like the **paramāṇu** is not more than one to countless **kālas**.  **Varṇa** and other **paryāyas** are also infinite. Subsequently, **paryāyas** are also considered from the perspective of three types: **jaghanya**, **utkṛṣṭa**, and **madhyama**, in terms of **sthiti**, **avagāhana**, and **varṇa**-based distinctions.  

The difference from other **darśaniya** beliefs is that if a **dravya** has **paryāyas** (**pariṇāma**), then it should be considered **pariṇāma-nitya**, not **kūṭa-sthā-nitya**. **Paramāṇu-vādi** **Naiyāyika** and **Vaiśeṣika** consider the **paramāṇu** to be **kūṭa-sthā-nitya**, while **Jain** philosophy considers it **pariṇāma-nitya**.  

Furthermore, **Jain** philosophy does not accept the absolute distinction of **avayava** and **avayavī** in **skandha** and **paramāṇu**, nor does it accept the distinction of **jāti** in **paramāṇu** as **pārthiva-paramāṇu**, etc. It considers the presence of all four - **rūpa**, **rasa**, etc. - in **paramāṇu** to be essential.

360] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra There are three-sensory beings, countless four-sensory beings, countless five-sensory beings, countless human beings, countless Vāṇavyantara Devas, countless Jyotiṣka Devas, countless Vaimānika Devas, and infinite, O Gautama! For this reason, it is said that they (Jīva-paryāya) are not countable, not countless, (but) infinite. The types of Vivecana-paryāya and the infinite Jīva-paryāya are explained in detail in two sūtras (Sū. 438-436). Paryāya: The word "Paryāya" is synonymous with "Svārūpa" and "Pīṛa". Although the previous verse mentioned Jīvas in the form of Nairyika, Tiryañc, Manuşya, Deva, etc., as a state of being, this verse is mentioned to determine the Jīva-paryāyas in the form of Audayika, Kṣayopashamika, and Kṣayika, as well as the Ajīva-paryāyas like Pudgala, etc. Both Jīva and Ajīva are dravyas. The characteristic of dravya is said to be "Guṇa-paryāyavattva". Therefore, this verse describes the paryāyas of both Jīva and Ajīva. Paryāya, Paryava, Guṇa, Viśeṣa, and Dharma; these are often synonymous words. From the perspective of knowing the quantity of paryāyas, Gautama Svāmī asks this question: Are the paryāyas of Jīva countable, countless, or infinite? The Bhagavān said that the paryāyas of Jīva are infinite because when those who have paryāyas (like Vanaspatikāyika, Siddha Jīva, etc.) are infinite, then the paryāyas are also infinite. Although all except Vanaspatikāyika and Siddha are countless-countless, but since both of them are infinite, the paryāyas of Jīva will be considered infinite in totality. Not countable or countless. Why and how do Nairyikas have infinite paryāyas? 440. "Neraiaṇam bhanta! Kevatiya pajjava paṇṇata?" "Go'yama! Aṇanta pajjava paṇṇatta." "Se keṇṭheṇam bhanta!

The Fifth Special Term (Synonymous Term):

[361] The Prāmāṇika-bodhi-jñāna-paryāyas, Śruta-jñāna-paryāyas, Avadhi-jñāna-paryāyas, Mati-ajñāna-paryāyas, Śruta-ajñāna-paryāyas, Vibhaṅga-jñāna-paryāyas, Cakṣu-darśana-paryāyas, Prācakṣu-darśana-paryāyas, and Avadhi-darśana-paryāyas are the Ṣaḍ-sthāna-vartī (existing in six places) of the Nāraka beings. 

O Gautama! Thus, it is said that the Nāraka beings have innumerable, not countable, and infinite paryāyas (synonymous terms).

[Question] Bhagavan! How many paryāyas (synonymous terms) are attributed to the Nāraka beings?

[Answer] Gautama! Infinite paryāyas are attributed to them.

[Question] Bhagavan! Why do you say that the paryāyas of the Nāraka beings are infinite?

[Answer] Gautama! One Nāraka being is equal to another Nāraka being in terms of substance. They are equal in terms of spatial units. In some aspects, they may be inferior, equal, or superior. If inferior, they may be inferior by an innumerable fraction or a countable fraction; or they may be inferior by innumerable qualities or countable qualities. If superior, they may be superior by an innumerable fraction or a countable fraction; or they may be superior by innumerable qualities or countable qualities.

In terms of state, one may be sometimes inferior, sometimes equal, and sometimes superior to another. If inferior, they may be inferior by an innumerable fraction or a countable fraction; or they may be inferior by innumerable qualities or countable qualities. If superior, they may be superior by an innumerable fraction or a countable fraction; or they may be superior by innumerable qualities or countable qualities.

Considering the black color paryāyas, one may be sometimes inferior, sometimes equal, and sometimes superior to another. If inferior, they may be inferior by an infinite fraction, an innumerable fraction, or a countable fraction; or they may be inferior by innumerable qualities, countable qualities, or infinite qualities. If superior, they may be superior by an infinite fraction, an innumerable fraction, or a countable fraction; or they may be superior by innumerable qualities, countable qualities, or infinite qualities.

Considering the blue, red, yellow, and white color paryāyas, one is superior to another in terms of existing in six places. Considering the pleasant fragrance and unpleasant fragrance paryāyas, one is superior to another in terms of existing in six places. Considering the bitter, pungent, astringent, sour, and sweet taste paryāyas, one is superior to another in terms of existing in six places. Considering the rough, soft, heavy, light, cold, hot, smooth, and dry touch paryāyas, one is superior to another in terms of existing in six places.

[362] From the perspective of the categories of knowledge (Prajñāpanā), and the categories of rough and subtle touch, a Naraka (hell being) is inferior to another Naraka in terms of the six categories of existence (Shatsthānapatita). Similarly, from the perspective of the categories of Abhinibodhik-knowledge, Shruta-knowledge, Avadhi-knowledge, Mati-ignorance, Shruta-ignorance, Vibhang-knowledge, Chakshudarshan-knowledge, Achakshudarshan-knowledge, and Avadhi-darshan-knowledge, a Naraka is superior to another Naraka in terms of the six categories of existence (Shatsthānapatita).

O Gautama! For this reason, it is said that "the categories of Narakas are not countable, not uncountable, but infinite."

**Discussion of the infinite categories of Narakas:** Why and how?

This sutra establishes the infinite categories of Narakas by demonstrating the inferiority of one Naraka to another in terms of the categories of knowledge, such as perception, location, color, smell, taste, touch, and the state of diminishing karma.

**The origin and solution of the question:**

Generally, where the beings are infinite, their categories are also infinite. But how can the categories be infinite where the beings (Narakas) are not infinite (but uncountable)? This question is raised by Shri Gautama Swami.

**The solution provided by the Lord:**

The solution is provided in terms of the categories of substance, space, time, and state.

**From the perspective of substance:**

There is equality among Narakas. Each Naraka is equal to another Naraka from the perspective of substance, meaning each Naraka is a single living being (Jiva-dravya). There is no difference between them from the perspective of substance. This statement also indicates that each Naraka is a complete and independent living being (Jiva-dravya) in itself. Although no substance can ever be completely devoid of categories, if only the pure substance is considered, without considering the categories, there is no difference between one Naraka and another.

**From the perspective of space:**

There is equality among Narakas. From the perspective of space, all Narakas are equal to each other because each Naraka is as vast as the space of the living beings (Jiva-loka). There is no difference in the space of any Naraka. The difference between having space and not having space exists only in the Pudgalas. An atom (Paramānu) does not have space, while a two-space, three-space, etc., Skandha has space.

**From the perspective of space (Avagahana):**

There is superiority among Narakas. The meaning of Avagahana is generally to encompass the space of the universe. Here, it means the height of the body. From the perspective of Avagahana (height of the body), all Narakas are not equal. For example, the Narakas of the Ratnaprabha-earth have a body that is the smallest Avagahana, which is an uncountable fraction of an inch, and the largest Avagahana is seven bows, three hands, and six inches. As we move to the higher Naraka-earths, the Avagahana doubles with each earth. In the seventh Naraka-earth, the smallest Avagahana is an uncountable fraction of an inch, and the largest Avagahana is five hundred bows. From this perspective, the Avagahana of one Naraka is inferior to another, the Avagahana of one is superior to another, and the Avagahana of some is equal. If a Naraka is inferior in Avagahana (smaller), it will be uncountably smaller or countably smaller, or it will be countably smaller or uncountably smaller. But if a Naraka is superior in Avagahana (larger), it will be uncountably larger or countably larger.

The fifth special point (Paryaya-pad) will be; either the number-multiplied-less or the innumerable-multiplied-less. This being-more is called Chatur-sthana-patit. Narakas are innumerable-part-less or number-part-less or number-part-more or innumerable-part-more in this way, for example- one Naraka's Avagahana is 500 Dhanush and the other's Avagahana is 500 Dhanush less the innumerable part of an Angul / the innumerable part of an Angul is the innumerable part of 500 Dhanush / therefore, the Naraka who has Avagahana of 500 Dhanush less the innumerable part of an Angul is innumerable-part-less than the Naraka who has Avagahana of 500 Dhanush, and the Naraka who has Avagahana of 500 Dhanush is innumerable-part-more than the other Naraka / similarly, one Naraka has Avagahana of 500 Dhanush, while the other is 2 Dhanush less than him, that is, he has Avagahana of 498 Dhanush / 2 Dhanush is the number-part of 500 Dhanush. From this perspective, the second Naraka is number-part-less than the first Naraka, while the first (the one with 500 Dhanush) Naraka is number-part-more than the second Naraka (the one with 498 Dhanush) / similarly, one Naraka has Avagahana of 125 Dhanush and the other has Avagahana of the whole 500 Dhanush. 125 Dhanush multiplied by four becomes 500 Dhanush. From this perspective, the one who has Avagahana of 125 Dhanush is number-multiplied-less than the Naraka who has Avagahana of 500 Dhanush, and the one who has Avagahana of 500 Dhanush is number-multiplied-more than the Naraka who has Avagahana of 125 Dhanush / similarly, one Naraka is in the insufficient state and has Avagahana of the innumerable part of an Angul and the other Naraka has Avagahana of 500 Dhanush / the innumerable part of an Angul multiplied by innumerable becomes 500 Dhanush / therefore, the Naraka who has Avagahana of the innumerable part of an Angul is innumerable-multiplied-less than the Naraka who has Avagahana of the complete 500 Dhanush, and the Naraka who has Avagahana of 500 Dhanush is innumerable-multiplied-more than the Naraka who has Avagahana of the innumerable part of an Angul. With respect to time (state), Narakas are less or more - with respect to state (experience of lifespan), one Naraka is possibly less, possibly equal and possibly more than another Naraka / like Avagahana, with respect to state, one Naraka is also innumerable-part-less or number-part-less or number-multiplied-less or innumerable-multiplied-less than another Naraka, or he is innumerable-part-more or number-part-more or number-multiplied-more or innumerable-multiplied-more, he is Chatur-sthana-patit. For example- one Naraka is in the state of complete 33 Sagaropama, while the other Naraka is in the state of 33 Sagaropama less one or two times. Therefore, the Naraka who is in the state of 33 Sagaropama less one or two times is innumerable-part-less than the Naraka who is in the state of complete 33 Sagaropama, while the Naraka who is in the state of complete 33 Sagaropama is innumerable-part-more than the Naraka who is in the state of 33 Sagaropama less one or two times; because one or two times are only the innumerable part of Sagaropama. Similarly, one Naraka is in the state of 33 Sagaropama, and the other is in the state of 33 Sagaropama less Palyopama / 10 Kotakoti Palyopama makes one Sagaropama. From this perspective, the Naraka who is in the state less by Palyopama is number-part-less than the Naraka who is in the state of complete 33 Sagaropama, while the other is number-part-more than the first / similarly, one Naraka is in the state of 33 Sagaropama, while the other is in the state of one Sagaropama. In these, the one who is in the state of one Sagaropama is number-multiplied-less than the Naraka who is in the state of 33 Sagaropama,

## Prajñāpanā Sūtra:

Because multiplying one sāgara by thirty-three sāgaras results in thirty-three sāgaras, conversely, a hell with the state of thirty-three sāgaras is innumerably times greater in number than a hell with the state of one sāgara. Similarly, one hell has a state of ten thousand years, while another hell has a state of thirty-three sāgaras. Multiplying ten thousand by an innumerable number of times results in thirty-three sāgaras. Therefore, the hell with a state of ten thousand years is innumerably times greater in state than the hell with a state of thirty-three sāgaras, while the hell with a state of thirty-three sāgaras is innumerably times greater in state than the former.

**Regarding the state of being greater or lesser in hells:**

1. **Based on the variations of color like black, etc.:** The state of being greater or lesser in color, smell, taste, and touch is described based on the arising of the audayika bhāva (arising state) from the pudgala-vipāki nāmakarma (karma that affects the body). For example, compared to the variations of black color, one hell is infinitely less, innumerably less, or numerically less than another hell, or it is numerically greater, innumerably greater, or infinitely greater. If it is greater, then it is greater by an infinite part, an innumerable part, or a numerical part, or it is numerically greater, innumerably greater, or infinitely greater. This is the six-fold state of being greater or lesser. In this six-fold state of being greater or lesser, the one that is infinitely less than the other should be understood as being less than the one obtained by dividing by the infinite number of all living beings. The one that is innumerably less than the other should be understood as being less by the amount obtained by dividing by the innumerable number of loka-ākāśa-pradeśa (regions of space). The one that is numerically less than the other should be understood as being less than the one obtained by dividing by the utkriṣṭa-saṅkhyaka (highest number). In the number of multiplications, the one that is multiplied by the saṅkhyeya (number to be multiplied) should be understood as being equal to the amount obtained by multiplying the utkriṣṭa-saṅkhyaka by the (product) amount obtained. The one that is innumerably greater than the other should be multiplied by the amount equal to the innumerable number of loka-ākāśa-pradeśa, and the amount obtained by multiplying should be understood as being equal to that. The one that is infinitely greater than the other should be multiplied by the infinite number of all living beings, and the number obtained by multiplying should be understood as being equal to that. Similarly, the six-fold state of being greater or lesser between one hell and another should be determined based on the variations of blue, etc. Similarly, one hell is greater or lesser than another hell based on the variations of good smell and bad smell. This should also be understood as before. One hell is greater or lesser than another hell based on the variations of bitter, etc. taste. Similarly, there is a state of being greater or lesser based on the variations of rough, etc. touch. This should be understood.

2. **Based on the variations of the state of being destroyed or pacified:** Based on the variations of the three types of knowledge (mati, etc.), the three types of ignorance (mati-ajñāna, etc.), and the three types of vision (cakṣu-darśana, etc.), one hell is lesser, greater, or equal to another hell. Their state of being greater or lesser should also be understood according to the six-fold state of being greater or lesser, like the state of being greater or lesser based on the variations of color, etc. The meaning is that just as hells are called six-fold based on the audayika bhāva arising from the pudgala-vipāki nāmakarma, similarly, the state of being greater or lesser in hells based on the destruction or pacification of the jīva-vipāki jñāna-āvarṇīya, etc. karmas should be understood.

The fifth special point (Paryaya-pada) [regarding the 365 Kshayopa-shमिक emotions] should be understood as the loss and increase of the six-fold-state (Shat-sthana-patita) in comparison to the other Paryayas like Abhinibodhik knowledge, etc. The nature of the six-fold-state - although the number of Paryayas of the black color (Krishna-varna) is infinite, yet due to wrong conception, let it be considered as ten thousand and let the infinite number of all living beings (Sarva-jiva-ananta) be considered as one hundred. Then, dividing ten thousand by one hundred, the number one hundred is obtained. From this perspective, let the number of Krishna-varna Paryayas of one hell-being (Naraka) be ten thousand and that of another be ten thousand minus one hundred. Dividing by the infinite number of all living beings, the number one hundred is obtained, which is the infiniteth part. Therefore, the hell-being whose Krishna-varna Paryayas are ten thousand minus one hundred is called infinite-part-less (Ananta-bhaga-hina) in comparison to the hell-being with ten thousand Krishna-varna Paryayas. In comparison to it, the other hell-being with ten thousand Krishna-varna Paryayas is called infinite-part-more (Ananta-bhaga-adhika). Similarly, if the number fifty is divided from the ten thousand finite Krishna-varna Paryayas, which are conceived as the regions of the world-space (Loka-akasha), then the number two hundred is obtained. This is called the innumerableth part (Asankhyata-va). From this perspective, the Krishna-varna Paryayas of one hell-being are ten thousand minus two hundred and those of another are ten thousand. Out of these, the hell-being with ten thousand minus two hundred Krishna-varna Paryayas is called innumerable-part-less (Asankhyata-bhaga-hina) in comparison to the hell-being with ten thousand Krishna-varna Paryayas, and the hell-being with complete Krishna is called innumerable-part-more (Asankhyata-bhaga-adhika) in comparison to the one with ten thousand minus two hundred. Similarly, if the number ten, which is conceived as the numerical quantity, is divided from the aforementioned ten thousand Krishna-varna Paryayas, then the number one thousand is obtained. This number is the numerical part (Sankhyata-va) of ten thousand. Suppose, if the number ten, which is conceived as the numerical quantity, is divided from the Krishna-varna Paryayas of one hell-being, then the number one thousand is obtained. This number is the numerical part (Sankhyata-va) of ten thousand. Suppose, the Krishna-varna Paryayas of one hell-being are six thousand and those of another are ten thousand, then the hell-being with nine thousand Krishna-varna Paryayas is called numerical-part-less (Sankhyata-bhaga-hina) in comparison to the hell-being with ten thousand Krishna-varna Paryayas, and in comparison to it, the hell-being with complete ten thousand Krishna-varna Paryayas is called numerical-part-more (Sankhyata-bhaga-adhika). Similarly, the Krishna-varna Paryayas of one hell-being are one thousand and those of another are ten thousand. Here, multiplying the number ten, which is conceived as the excellent number (Utkrisht-sankhya), by one thousand, we get the number ten thousand. From this perspective, the hell-being with one thousand Krishna-varna Paryayas is called numerical-multiple-less (Sankhyata-guna-hina) in comparison to the hell-being with ten thousand Krishna-varna Paryayas, and in comparison to it, the hell-being with ten thousand Krishna-varna Paryayas is called numerical-multiple-more (Sankhyata-guna-adhika). Similarly, the number of Krishna-varna Paryayas of one hell-being is two hundred and that of another is ten thousand. If two hundred is multiplied by fifty, which is conceived as the innumerable form (Asankhyata-rupa), then it becomes ten thousand. Therefore, the hell-being with two hundred Krishna-varna Paryayas is called innumerable-multiple-less (Asankhyata-guna-hina) in comparison to the hell-being with ten thousand Krishna-varna Paryayas, and in comparison to it, the hell-being with ten thousand Krishna-varna Paryayas is called innumerable-multiple-more (Asankhyata-guna-adhika). Similarly, suppose the Krishna-varna Paryayas of one hell-being are one hundred and those of another are ten thousand. If one hundred is multiplied by one hundred, which is conceived as the infinite number of all living beings (Sarva-jiva-ananta), then the number ten thousand is obtained. Therefore, the hell-being with one hundred Krishna-varna Paryayas is called infinite-multiple-less (Ananta-guna-hina) in comparison to the hell-being with ten thousand Krishna-varna Paryayas, and in comparison to it, the other is called infinite-multiple-more (Ananta-guna-adhika). 1.

[366] [From the statement, the conclusion is - Here, the ṣaṣṭhānāpatita state of being more dominant, which is mentioned with reference to the synonyms of black color etc., clearly indicates that when there are infinite synonyms for just one black color, then what to say about the synonyms of all the categories? By this, it is also indicated that the jīva is endowed with various results, both self-created and other-created. According to the body obtained from karma-udaya, there is contraction and expansion in its (jīva's) ātmā-pradeśas, but there is no decrease or increase. The infinite synonyms of the Asurakumāra etc. who reside in the bhavana-devas are as follows: 441. [441 Pr.] Bhagavan! How many synonyms are there of the Asurakumāras? [441 U.] Gautama! They have infinite synonyms. [Pr.] Bhagavan! For what reason is it said that 'the Asurakumāras have infinite synonyms?' [U.] Gautama!

[Fifth Special Point (Synonym)] [It is inferior to the six-place-based (hinaadhik) in comparison to 367 darshan-paryayas. O Gautama! For this reason, it is said that the synonyms of Asurakumars are infinite. 442. And just as the Nairyayikas (are said to have infinite synonyms), and the Asurakumars are said to have, so also from the Nagakumars to the Stanitakumars (infinite synonyms should be said). [442] Discussion - In the two sutras (441-442) presenting the infinite synonyms of the Bhavanapatidevas starting from Asurakumars, the infinite synonyms of the Bhavanapatis from Asurakumars to Stanitakumars have been presented with excessive justification in the context of the Nairyayikas. The infinity of the synonyms of Asurakumars - one Asurakumar is equal to another Asurakumar in terms of substance and regions according to the aforementioned sutra, and is hinaadhik in terms of the synonyms of understanding and position as before, and is shatsthanaapatit in terms of the synonyms of Krishnaadivarna, sugandha-durgandha, tikt etc. rasa, karkas etc. touch and knowledge, ignorance and darshan as before. The meaning is that if there are infinite synonyms from Krishnavarna, then what to say about the synonyms of all classes? For this reason, the 'infinite synonyms' of Asurakumars are proved. The prototype of the infinite synonyms of the five stationary (ekendriya) 443. "Bhagavan! How many synonyms are said to be of the Prithvikaayikas?" "Gautama!

The fifth special category (synonyms) [369] is tri-sthana-patita (inferior) in relation to the state of being, and shat-sthana-patita (inferior) in relation to the synonyms of color, smell, taste, touch, mental ignorance, scriptural ignorance, and non-visual perception. 446.

[370] The six-fold difference (heenaadhik) is in relation to the *Prajnapanasutra* and the synonyms of *achakshudarshan*. For this reason, O Gautama! It is said that there are infinite synonyms of the plant-bodied beings. 

**Discussion - The prototype of the infinite synonyms of the five stationary beings:** In the present five sutras (Sutras 443 to 447), the infinite-infinite synonyms of each of the five one-sensed stationary beings, from the earth-bodied to the plant-bodied, have been described separately. 

**The infinity of the synonyms of the earth-bodied etc. one-sensed beings:** From different perspectives - in relation to the previous immersion, it is four-fold difference, in relation to the state, it is three-fold difference, and in relation to all color, smell, taste, and touch, and in relation to the synonyms of *mati-ajnan*, *shruta-ajnan*, and *achakshudarshan*, it has been shown that each of these one-sensed beings has infinite synonyms separately. 

Where there is four-fold difference (in immersion), there one earth-bodied etc. is an innumerable part, a countable part, or a countable multiple, or an innumerable multiple less than another earth-bodied etc., or it is an innumerable part, a countable part, or a countable multiple, or an innumerable multiple more. 

Although the immersion of the earth-bodied beings is the innumerable part of a finger, there are innumerable distinctions even in the innumerable part of a finger. Therefore, there is no contradiction in the aforementioned four-fold difference of the earth-bodied beings. 

Where there is three-fold difference (in state), the difference in the earth-bodied etc. should be understood in this way. One one-sensed being is an innumerable part or a countable part less than another one-sensed being, or it is a countable multiple less, or it is an innumerable part more, a countable part more, or a countable multiple more. 

There is no four-fold difference in their state, because innumerable multiple loss and innumerable multiple increase are not possible in them. 

The reason for this is that the lowest lifespan of the earth-bodied etc. is limited to the small-birth-grasping. The size of the small-birth is only two hundred and fifty-six *pravalika*. One *muhurt* is two *ghadi*. 

And in this one *muhurt*, there are 65,536 births. 

In addition, the highest state of the earth-bodied etc. is also only of countable years. Therefore, there cannot be innumerable multiple loss-increase (less-more) in them. 

Now, the matter of innumerable part, countable part, and countable multiple loss-increase is as follows: 

For example, the state of one earth-bodied being is complete 22,000 years, and that of another is one time less than 22,000 years. Of these, the earth-bodied being with the complete 22,000-year state will be called an innumerable part less than the earth-bodied being with the state of one time less than 22,000 years, while the other will be called an innumerable part more. 

Similarly, one has a complete 22,000-year state, while the other has 22,000 years less than the internal *muhurt* etc. The internal *muhurt* etc. is the countable part of twenty-two thousand years. Therefore, the one with the state of 22,000 years less than the internal *muhurt* is a countable part less than the one with the complete 22,000-year state, and the one with the state of 22,000 years less than the internal *muhurt* is a countable part more than it. 

Similarly, one earth-bodied being has a complete 22,000-year state, and the other has an internal *muhurt*, one month, one year, or one thousand years. The internal *muhurt* etc. becomes 22,000 years when multiplied by a fixed number. 

Therefore, the earth-bodied being with the lifespan of the internal *muhurt* etc. is a countable multiple less than the one with the complete twenty-two thousand year state, and it is a countable multiple more than it.

[372] The *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* states that *bodhi-jñāna*, *śruta-jñāna*, *mati-ajñāna*, *śruta-ajñāna*, and *pracakṣu-darśana* are *ṣaṭ-sthāna-patita* (inferior and superior) in relation to their *paryāyas*. 446. And so it is with the *Teindriya* beings. 449] In the same way, one should understand the (infinity of *paryāyas*) of the *Śrīndriya* beings. 450. And so it is with the *Caturindriya* beings. 450] There is an infinity of *paryāyas* of the *Caturindriya* beings. The special thing is that they also have *cakṣu-darśana*. 451. The *paryāyas* of the *pañcendriya* *tiryañc-yonika* beings should be described in the same way as the *nairāyika* beings (according to Sūtra 440). Discussion: The *vikaleindriya* and *tiryañc-pañcendriya* beings have an infinite number of *paryāyas*. This is explained in the four Sūtras (Sūtra 448 to 451) by describing the infinite number of *paryāyas* of the *dvīndriya*, *trīndriya*, *caturindriya*, and *tiryañc-pañcendriya* beings. The reason for the infinite number of *paryāyas* of the *vikaleindriya* and *tiryañc-pañcendriya* beings is that, although they are all equal in terms of *dravya* and *pradeśa*, they are *catur-sthāna-patita* in terms of *avagāhana*, *tri-sthāna-patita* in terms of *sthiti*, and *ṣaṭ-sthāna-patita* in terms of *varṇa* etc., *mati-jñāna* etc., and their *paryāyas*. Therefore, the infinity of their *paryāyas* is clear. 452. The *paryāyas* of humans: 452] "O Bhagavan! How many *paryāyas* are there of humans?" 452] "Gautama! There are infinite *paryāyas*." 452] "O Bhagavan! Why is it said that 'humans have infinite *paryāyas*?'" 1. *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* M. Vṛtti, letter no. 186.

[Fifth Special Term (Synonym)] [373 [U.] Gautama! With respect to dravya, one human being is equal to another human being, and also equal with respect to pradesha, (but) with respect to avagahana, they are chatur-sthana-patita (inferior-superior), with respect to sthiti, they are also chatur-sthana-patita (inferior-superior), and with respect to the synonyms of varna, gandha, rasa, sparsa, abhinibodhik jnana, shruta jnana, avadhi jnana, and manah-paryav jnana, they are shat-sthana-patita (inferior-superior), and with respect to the synonyms of kevala jnana, they are equal, with respect to the synonyms of three ajnana and three darshan, they are shat-sthana-patita, and with respect to the synonyms of kevala darshan, they are equal. / Discussion - In the present sutra (452), the infinite synonyms of humans are presented in a logical manner - by stating that they are chatur-sthana-patita with respect to avagahana and sthiti, and shat-sthana-patita with respect to the four jnanas of varna, gandha, rasa, sparsa, abhinibodhik, etc., the three ajnanas, and the three darshanas, and by stating that they are equal with respect to the synonyms of dravya, pradesha, and kevala jnana - kevala darshan, the infinite synonyms of humans are established. The four jnanas, three ajnanas, and three darshanas are inferior-superior - out of the five jnanas, the four jnanas, three ajnanas, and three darshanas are kshaya-upashmika. They arise from the kshaya-upashma of jnana-avaran and darshan-avaran, but the kshaya-upashma of all humans is not the same. / There are infinite differences due to the tartamta in kshaya-upashma. Therefore, their synonyms are called shat-sthana-patita inferior-superior, but kevala and kevala-darshan are kshayika. They arise only when jnana-avaran and darshan-avaran are completely destroyed, therefore, there is no inferiority or superiority in them. Just as one human being has kevala jnana or kevala darshan, so do all others, therefore, the synonyms of kevala jnana and kevala darshan are called equal. / How are they chatur-sthana-patita with respect to sthiti - the sthiti of panchendriya-tiryanch and humans is at most three palya-upam. Palya-upam is countless thousands of years. Therefore, due to the possibility of countless times increase and decrease in it, it is called chatur-sthana-patita. / The presentation of the infinite synonyms of Varan-vyantar, Jyotishka, and Vaimanika Devas 453. Vanamantara progahana-ttayaye thitiye ya chautthana-vadiya, vannaadihim chhatthana-vaditi. / [453] Varan-vyantar Devas are called chatur-sthana-patita (inferior-superior) with respect to avagahana and sthiti, and shat-sthana-patita (inferior-superior) with respect to the synonyms of varna, etc. / 454. Joisiya-vemania vi evam chev / Navaran thitiye titthama-vaditi. / [454] The inferiority of Jyotishka and Vaimanika Devas (synonyms) should also be understood in the same way (as per the previous sutra).

**[374]** In the *Prajñāpanā Sūtra*, the two sūtras (453, 454) that discuss the infinite *paryāyas* (cycles) of *vāṇavyantara*, *jyotiṣka* and *vaimānika* devās (celestial beings), present the *catur-sthāna-patita* (four-fold difference in status), *ṣaṭ-sthāna-patita* (six-fold difference in status) and *tri-sthāna-patita* (three-fold difference in status) of these beings to explain their infinite *paryāyas*.

The *vāṇavyantara* devās are *catur-sthāna-patita* (four-fold difference in status), while the *jyotiṣka* and *vaimānika* devās are *tri-sthāna-patita* (three-fold difference in status). The *vāṇavyantara* devās have a lowest status of 10,000 years and a highest status of one *palya-upam* (a unit of time). Therefore, they can also be *catur-sthāna-patita* (four-fold difference in status). However, the *jyotiṣka* and *vaimānika* devās only have a *tri-sthāna-patita* (three-fold difference in status) because their lowest status is one-eighth of a *palya-upam* and their highest status is one lakh years more than a *palya-upam*. Therefore, they cannot have an infinite increase or decrease in their status.

The *vaimānika* devās have a lowest status of one *palya-upam* and a highest status of thirty-three *sāgara-upam* (a unit of time). One *sāgara-upam* is equal to ten *koṭa-koṭi* *palya-upam*. Therefore, the *vaimānika* devās also cannot have an infinite increase or decrease in their status. This is why the *jyotiṣka* and *vaimānika* devās are only *tri-sthāna-patita* (three-fold difference in status) in their status.

**[455]** The *paryāyas* (cycles) of the *nāraka* (hell beings) with different levels of *avagāhana* (absorption) are as follows:

**[1]** "O Gautama! How many *paryāyas* (cycles) are there for the *nairaika* (hell beings) with *jaghanya-avagāhana* (lowest absorption)?"

"O Gautama! There are infinite *paryāyas* (cycles)."

"O Gautama! Why is it said that there are infinite *paryāyas* (cycles) for the *nairaika* (hell beings) with *jaghanya-avagāhana* (lowest absorption)?"

"O Gautama! A *nairaika* (hell being) with *jaghanya-avagāhana* (lowest absorption) is equal to another *nairaika* (hell being) with *jaghanya-avagāhana* (lowest absorption) in terms of *dravya* (substance), *pradeśa* (space), and *avagāhana* (absorption). However, they are *catur-sthāna-patita* (four-fold difference in status) in terms of *sthiti* (status) and *ṣaṭ-sthāna-patita* (six-fold difference in status) in terms of *varṇa* (color), *gandha* (smell), *rasa* (taste), *sparśa* (touch), *jñāna* (knowledge), *ajñāna* (ignorance), and *darśana* (perception)."

**[2]** "O Gautama! How many *paryāyas* (cycles) are there for the *nairaika* (hell beings) with *ukkośa-avagāhana* (highest absorption)?"

"O Gautama! There are infinite *paryāyas* (cycles)."

Gaumata! Ananta paryaya have been described for the nairayikas (denizens of hell) with utmost (uttkosha) immersion (gahana).

The reason is that a nairayika with utmost immersion is equal to another nairayika with utmost immersion in terms of dravya (substance), pradesha (spatial units), and avagahana (depth of immersion); but may be inferior, equal, or superior in terms of sthiti (duration). If inferior, it may be by an innumerable (asankhyata) or countable (sankhyata) fraction. If superior, it may be by an innumerable or countable fraction.

In terms of paryayas (modes) of varna (color), gandha (odor), rasa (taste), and sparsha (touch), as well as the three jnanas (knowledges), three ajnanas (ignorances), and three darsanas (perceptions), it is shatsthanapatita (fallen in six places).

Similarly, for the nairayikas with medium (madhyama) immersion, they are equal in terms of dravya and pradesha, but may be inferior, equal, or superior in terms of avagahana and sthiti, with the same innumerable and countable variations. They too are shatsthanapatita.

[376] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra [U.]] Gautama! A hell being with medium immersion is equal to another hell being with medium immersion in terms of substance, equal in terms of regions, possibly inferior, possibly equal, and possibly superior in terms of immersion. If inferior, it is inferior by an innumerable part or by a countable part, or it is inferior by a countable multiple or by an innumerable multiple. If superior, it is superior by an innumerable part or by a countable part, or it is superior by a countable multiple or by an innumerable multiple. It is possibly inferior, possibly equal, and possibly superior in terms of position. If inferior, it is inferior by an innumerable part or by a countable part, or it is inferior by a countable multiple or by an innumerable multiple. If superior, it is superior by an innumerable part or by a countable part, or it is superior by a countable multiple or by an innumerable multiple. In terms of the categories of color, smell, taste, and touch, it is ṣaṭsthānapatita (inferior-superior) in relation to the three knowledges, the three ignorances, and the three visions. Gautama! For this reason, it is said that "the hell beings with medium immersion have infinite categories." 456. [1] Venerable! How many categories are there for the hell beings with the lowest position? [456-1 U.] Gautama! (They have) infinite categories. [Pr.] Venerable! For what reason is it said that the hell beings with the lowest position have infinite categories? [U.] Gautama! A hell being with the lowest position is equal to another hell being with the lowest position in terms of substance, equal in terms of regions, catuḥsthānapatita in terms of immersion, equal in terms of position, and ṣaṭsthānapatita (inferior-superior) in relation to the categories of color, smell, taste, and touch, as well as the three knowledges, the three ignorances, and the three visions. [456-2] The same applies to a hell being with the highest position. [456-3] The same applies to a hell being with a neither-lowest-nor-highest (medium) position. The difference is that it is catuḥsthānapatita in its own position.

The Narakas with Jghana and Utkrushta Avagaha are equal in terms of substance, region, and Avagaha. A Naraka with Jghana and Utkrushta Avagaha is equal to another Naraka in terms of substance, because "every substance has infinite synonyms." According to this principle, even though the Naraka Jiva-dravya is one, it has infinite synonyms.

## Translation:

[380] It is possible for a being to be a *prajñāpanā* (one who has attained knowledge). Even though there are infinite *paryāyas* (states of existence), it is one in terms of *dravya* (substance), just like other *nārakas* (hell beings) are one each. Similarly, each *nārak* being has countless *pradeśas* (regions) as vast as the *loka-ākāśa* (space of the universe), so it is also equal in terms of *pradeśas*. It is also equal in terms of *avagāhanā* (descent), because the *jghanya* (inferior) and *utkṛṣṭa* (superior) *avagāhanā* have the same location, and there is no possibility of *tartamātā-hīnādhikta* (difference in speed of descent).

In terms of *sthiti* (position), there is no rule of equality in the position of *nārakas* who are *catur-sthāna-patita* (fallen in four states) and have *jghanya* *avagāhanā*. Because a *nārak* with *jghanya* *avagāhanā* is in the *ratna-prabhā-pṛthvī* (earth of radiant jewels) for 10,000 years, and a *nārak* with *utkṛṣṭa* *sthiti* is in the seventh earth. Therefore, a *nārak* with *jghanya* or *utkṛṣṭa* *avagāhanā* can be *asan-khyāta-bhāga* (countless parts) or *saṅkhyāta-bhāga* (countable parts) less, or *saṅkhyāta-guṇa* (countable times) or *asan-khyāta-guṇa* (countless times) less in terms of *sthiti*. Or, it can be *asan-khyāta-bhāga* or *saṅkhyāta-bhāga* more, or *saṅkhyāta-guṇa* or *asan-khyāta-guṇa* more. Therefore, *nārakas* are *catur-sthāna-patita* in terms of *sthiti*.

How can a *nārak* with *jghanya* *avagāhanā* have three *jñānas* (knowledge) or three *ajñānas* (ignorance)? When a *garbha-ja-saṅjñī-pañcendriya* (embryonic, conscious, five-sensed) being is born in the *nārakas*, it sheds its previously acquired *audārika-śarīra* (physical body) at the first moment of experiencing the pain of the *nārakāyu* (hell life). At that same time, three *jñānas* arise for a *samyag-dṛṣṭi* (right-seeing) being, and three *ajñānas* arise for a *mithyā-dṛṣṭi* (wrong-seeing) being. Afterwards, it takes on a *vaikriya-śarīra* (transformed body) by moving with or without a *vigraha* (form). However, a *sammūcchima-asan-jñī-pañcendriya* (unconscious, five-sensed) being born in hell does not have *vibhanga-jñāna* (knowledge of differentiation) at that time. Therefore, it should be understood that a *nārak* with *jghanya* *avagāhanā* has two or three *ajñānas* due to *bhajanā* (attachment).

In terms of *sthiti*, there is no rule that all *nārakas* with *dvi-sthāna-patita* (fallen in two states) and *utkṛṣṭa* *avagāhanā* have the same or different positions. If they are different and less, then they are either *asan-khyāta-bhāga-hīna* (countless parts less) or *saṅkhyāta-bhāga-hīna* (countable parts less). And if they are more, then they are *asan-khyāta-bhāga-adhika* (countless parts more) or *saṅkhyāta-bhāga-adhika* (countable parts more). In this way, one should understand the *hīnādhikta* (difference) of *dvi-sthāna-patita* in terms of *sthiti*. There is no *saṅkhyāta-guṇa* or *asan-khyāta-guṇa* *hīnādhikta* here, therefore *catur-sthāna-patita* is not possible. Because *nārakas* with *utkṛṣṭa* *avagāhanā* are found only in the seventh hell, which is 500 *dhanuṣya* (bows) high.

## Fifth Special Point (Paryaya Pab)

[381] The most excellent perception is of 500 dhanush, and the least perception is of an innumerable part of an angul. All the perceptions between these two are of the category of medium perception. This means that medium perception should be understood as being from an innumerable part of an angul more to an innumerable part of an angul less than 500 dhanush. This perception can be four-fold degenerate like the perception of an ordinary naraka.

A naraka with a lower position is equal to another naraka with a lower position in terms of the position of the lower position, because there is only one position of the lower position, and no kind of inferiority or superiority is possible in it.

A naraka with a lower position is four-fold degenerate in terms of perception compared to a naraka with a lower position, because the perception in them ranges from an innumerable part of an angul to 7 dhanush.

A naraka with a medium position is four-fold degenerate in terms of the position of the naraka with a lower position, because the position of the naraka with a lower position and the position of the naraka with a higher position are considered equal to each other, but there is four-fold degeneration in the position of the naraka with a medium position, because the medium position is of many types due to gradation. In the medium position, the situation is calculated from a time more than ten thousand years to a time less than thirty sagaropama. Therefore, it is natural for it to be four-fold degenerate.

A naraka is equal to another naraka in terms of the Krishnavarna Paryaya, because there is only one form of the lower, and there is no diversity or inferiority or superiority in it.

Knowledge and ignorance do not exist together. A naraka that has knowledge does not have ignorance, and a naraka that has ignorance does not have knowledge, because these two are mutually contradictory. Samyagdristi has knowledge and mithyadristi has ignorance. A samyagdristi is not a mithyadristi, and a mithyadristi is not a samyagdristi.

[385] Regarding the Paryayas (alternatives) of Earth-bodied beings (composed of the six tastes and six touch-perceptions), it should be said (according to the previous sutra). 

[470] [1] "Bhagavan! How many Paryayas are said for the Jhannamati-Agnani (ignorant with inferior intellect) Earth-bodied beings?" 
"Gautama! Their Paryayas are said to be infinite." 
"Bhagavan! For what reason is it said that the Paryayas of Jhannamati-Agnani Earth-bodied beings are infinite?" 
"Gautama! One Jhannamati-Agnani Earth-bodied being is equal to another Jhannamati-Agnani Earth-bodied being in terms of substance, equal in terms of regions, but is a Chaturthasthanapatita (fallen from four states) in terms of understanding, a Tristhanapatita (fallen from three states) in terms of position, and a Shatasthanapatita (fallen from six states) in terms of the Paryayas of color, smell, taste, and touch; equal in terms of the Paryayas of intellect and ignorance; but a Shatasthanapatita in terms of the Paryayas of Shruta-Agnani (ignorant of scriptures) and Achakhu-Darshan (blind vision)."

[3] "Similarly, it should be said regarding the Paryayas of Ajhannamati-Anutkrishta-mati-Agnani (ignorant with neither inferior nor superior intellect) (Earth-bodied beings).

[386] [ Prajñāpanā Sūtra 472. Just as it has been said regarding the Earth-bodied categories (Pṛthvīkāyika) with inferior, superior, and medium intellect, hearing, and knowledge, and those who are blind and see, so also (from the non-bodied) up to the plant-bodied beings (the statement regarding categories should be made). _ Discussion: In the seven sūtras (from sū-466 to 472) presenting the form of the categories regarding the five stationary beings (sthāvara) beginning with the Earth-bodied, which are endowed with inferior, medium, and superior immersion (pravagaha), etc., the statement regarding the categories of the five one-sensed beings (ekendriya) beginning with the Earth-bodied, which are endowed with inferior, medium, and superior immersion, up to blind and seeing, has been made. _ The Earth-bodied, etc., one-sensed beings with inferior, etc., immersion, are equal to each other in terms of the quantity of their categories, in comparison to the two Earth-bodied, etc., one-sensed beings with inferior and superior immersion! But the two Earth-bodied, etc., one-sensed beings with medium immersion are mutually four-place-fallen (catur-sthāna-patita) in their own place, in comparison to each other. _ That is, one Earth-bodied, etc., one-sensed being with medium immersion is four-place-fallen from another Earth-bodied, etc., one-sensed being with medium immersion, in terms of immersion, because, generally, even when there is medium immersion, it is of various types. It does not have a single place, like inferior and superior immersion. The reason for this is that the birth of the Earth-bodied, etc., is called their own place (sv-sthāna). In this type of own place, an immeasurable number of years of lifespan is possible, so it is either immeasurable-partless, countable-partless, or countable-multiple-less, or immeasurable-multiple-less, or it is immeasurable-part-more, countable-part-more, or countable-multiple-more, or immeasurable-multiple-more. In this way, it is four-place-fallen. In the same way, the inferiority and superiority of the Earth-bodied, etc., endowed with position, color, etc., intellect, hearing, and knowledge, and blind and seeing, are four-place-fallen in comparison to immersion. ' The Earth-bodied, etc., with inferior, etc., position, etc., are equal to each other in terms of the quantity of their categories, in comparison to the position of the categories, but they are not equal in comparison to the categories of immersion, color, etc., and intellect, hearing, and knowledge, and blind and seeing; because the position of the Earth-bodied, etc., is of countable years, this has been said earlier in the context of the statement regarding the collective Earth-bodied beings. Therefore, if the Earth-bodied, etc., with inferior, etc., immersion, etc., are inferior to each other, then they are immeasurable-partless, countable-partless, or countable-multiple-less; if they are superior, then they are immeasurable-part-more, countable-part-more, or countable-multiple-more. It is not immeasurable-multiple-less or more, according to the aforementioned reasoning. Why are only two ignorance and blind and seeing presented in the aforementioned Earth-bodied, etc.? - All the Earth-bodied, etc., are of false vision (mithyā-dṛṣṭi). They do not have right vision (samyak-tva), and a right-visioned being (samyak-dṛṣṭi) is not born in the Earth-bodied, etc. _ Therefore, only two ignorance are found in them. For this reason, here 1.

Two types of ignorance have been described. Similarly, since earth-bodied beings lack the eye sense, they do not have eye-sight. Therefore, only non-eye-sight has been described here. / The middle color, etc., with qualities like earth-bodied beings, etc., have the same place in terms of synonym quantity - like the inferior and superior black color, etc. There is no possibility of less or more in them, in that way the place of the middle black color is not one. / One part black color, etc., is inferior and the black color, etc., with the most parts is called superior. There are infinite alternatives of black color, etc., between these two. / For example, two-quality black, three-quality black, four-quality black, ten-quality black, countable-quality black, uncountable-quality black, infinite-quality black. / Similarly, one should understand about other colors and smell, taste, and touch. Therefore, there are infinite middle synonyms of black color above the inferior quality black and below the superior quality black. The meaning is that the synonym of the inferior and superior quality, etc., is one, but the synonyms of the middle quality black color, etc., are infinite. This is the reason why even if two earth-bodied beings are of middle quality black color, there can be infinite differences and more in them. / With this intention, the less and more of the six-place-fallen has been described everywhere in the proper place. Similarly, one should understand the six-place-fallen everywhere in the future. Like earth-bodied beings, the synonym-related description of other single-sensed beings should be understood according to the earth-bodied beings formula, as described in formula 472. Like the earth-bodied beings formula, the inferior, superior, and middle, substance, region, immersion, position, color, etc., and knowledge-ignorance, etc., of non-bodied, luminous-bodied, air-bodied, and plant-bodied beings should be understood according to their respective less and more. / The synonym of the immersion, etc., with inferior, etc., of special defective-sensed beings 473.

This section (Sutras 473-480) presents the infinite synonyms of the lowest, highest, and middle two-sensed, three-sensed, and four-sensed beings in eight sutras, considering various aspects.

**Why is the middle-understanding two-sensed being a four-fold difference?**

A middle-understanding two-sensed being is not equal to another middle-understanding two-sensed being in terms of understanding, but rather a four-fold difference. This is because middle understanding is not uniform; one middle understanding can be less than another by a countable or uncountable number, or greater by a countable or uncountable number, and so on in all four ways.

Middle understanding begins only after the first moment of the insufficient state. Therefore, it also exists in the insufficient state. This is why the right understanding of taste is also possible during middle understanding. This is why two knowledges can also coexist here.

**Two ignorances in two-sensed beings without right understanding of taste.**

Two ignorances are found in two-sensed beings in the lowest state, not two knowledges. This is because a two-sensed being in the lowest state is insufficient in attainment. Insufficient beings do not develop the right understanding of taste. This is because insufficient beings are extremely entangled, and the right understanding of taste is a slightly auspicious result. Therefore, the right understanding of taste does not arise in the two-sensed form in the lowest state.

**Two knowledges in two-sensed beings in the highest state.**

Beings with the right understanding of taste can also arise in two-sensed beings in the highest state. Therefore, what is said about the synonyms of two-sensed beings in the lowest state should also be understood for those in the highest state, but the synonyms of two knowledges should also be presented.

**Statement about two-sensed beings in the middle state.**

The statement about the quantity of synonyms related to these should be understood as the same as for two-sensed beings in the highest state, but it should be said that they are a three-fold difference in terms of their state. This is because the state of all those in the middle state is not equal.

**A black two-sensed being with a lower quality is a three-fold difference in terms of state.**

One black two-sensed being with a lower quality is a three-fold difference in terms of state from another black two-sensed being with a lower quality. This is because the state of a two-sensed being is in terms of countable years, so it cannot be a four-fold difference.

**Synonym presentation of a middle-understanding two-sensed being.**

Its presentation and all other presentations are the same as for a lowest-understanding two-sensed being, but the only difference is that it is a six-fold difference in its own state, being both less and more. Just as there is only one synonym each for the highest and lowest understanding two-sensed beings, there is not one for the middle-understanding two-sensed being, because it has infinite forms of being both less and more.

## Fifth Special Point (Synonym) [397]

There is no insignificant degradation for a being with an immeasurable lifespan. For this reason, a being with insignificant degradation is called a "tri-sthana-patita" in comparison to the state of a "tiryanch-panchendriya" (five-sensed being in the animal realm), whose nature has been explained earlier.

A "tiryanch-panchendriya" with insignificant degradation does not have "avdhi" (clairvoyance) or "vibhanga" (knowledge of the subtle) knowledge. A "panchendriya-tiryanch" with insignificant degradation is insufficient, and being insufficient, it is born in beings with small bodies. Therefore, "avdhi" or "vibhanga" knowledge is not possible in it. For this reason, only two types of knowledge and two types of ignorance are mentioned here.

Although it will be said later that a being with "vibhanga" knowledge can be born in a "panchendriya-tiryanch" with a lifespan of countless years after being released from hell, it can be born in beings with large bodies, not in those with small bodies. Therefore, one should not understand any contradiction.

There is no "shat-sthana-patita" (six-fold degradation) in degradation. A "panchendriya-tiryanch" with moderate degradation is a "chatu-sthana-patita" (four-fold degradation) in terms of degradation and state. Since moderate degradation is of many types, there can be an increase or decrease in the number of "san-khyat" (countable) and "asan-khyat" (uncountable) qualities. Also, a being with moderate degradation can have an immeasurable lifespan. Therefore, it is also a "chatu-sthana-patita" in terms of state.

A "tiryanch-panchendriya" with excellent state is a "parya-va-k-tavya-ta" (synonym). A "panchendriya-tiryanch" with excellent state has a state of three "palya-upam" (units of time). Therefore, they have two types of knowledge and two types of ignorance. Those who have knowledge bind the lifespan of a "vaimanika" (celestial being), then there are two types of knowledge. With this intention, two types of knowledge or two types of ignorance are mentioned in them.

A "tiryanch-panchendriya" with moderate state is a "chatu-sthana-patita" in terms of state. A "tiryanch-panchendriya" with moderate state can have a lifespan of countable or immeasurable years. Because a being with a lifespan of less than three "palya-upam" is also called a being with moderate state. Therefore, it is a "chatu-sthana-patita".

A "tiryanch-panchendriya" with "pra-bhi-ni-bodhika" (awakening) knowledge is a "chatu-sthana-patita" in terms of state. Even in a "panchendriya-tiryanch" with an immeasurable lifespan, insignificant "pra-bhi-ni-bodhika" knowledge and "shruta" (scriptural) knowledge are found according to their role. Similarly, since insignificant "mati-shruta" (intellectual scriptural) knowledge is possible in beings with a countable lifespan, it is called a "chatu-sthana-patita" here in terms of state.

A "tiryanch-panchendriya" with moderate "pra-bhi-ni-bodhika" knowledge is a "shat-sthana-patita" in comparison. Because the synonyms of the highest form of "pra-bhi-ni-bodhika" knowledge are infinite. Therefore, there can also be infinite increase or decrease in them.

A "tiryanch-panchendriya" with moderate "avdhi" knowledge is a "shat-sthana-patita" in its own state. This means that it is a "shat-sthana-patita" in its own state, i.e., moderate "avdhi" knowledge. One "tiryanch-panchendriya" with moderate "avdhi" knowledge can be more than another "tiryanch-panchendriya" with moderate "avdhi" knowledge without being a "shat-sthana-patita".

A "tiryanch-panchendriya" with "vibhanga" knowledge is a "tri-sthana-patita" in terms of state. Since "avdhi" knowledge and "vibhanga" knowledge are not present in a being with an immeasurable lifespan, "avdhi" knowledge and "vibhanga" knowledge are generally "tri-sthana-patita" (increase or decrease).

## Fifth Special Term (Synonym)

[401] A human being is equal in terms of substance, equal in terms of regions, four-fold different in terms of comprehension, four-fold different in terms of state, six-fold different in terms of synonyms of color, smell, taste, and touch, and equal in terms of synonyms of omniscient knowledge. However, they are six-fold different in terms of synonyms of scriptural knowledge and in terms of the two visions.

The special point is that they are equal in terms of synonyms of omniscient knowledge, three-fold different in terms of state, and six-fold different in terms of the three knowledges and the three visions. [3] The non-inferior, non-excellent (medium) omniscient knowers should be said to be like the excellent omniscient knowers in terms of their synonyms. The special point is that they are four-fold different in terms of state and six-fold different in their own state. [464] Similarly, (the inferior, excellent, and medium) scriptural knowers (should be understood in terms of their synonyms). [465] [1] "Lord! How many synonyms are there for the inferior knowledge-possessing humans?" [465-1 U] "Gautama! There are infinite synonyms for them." [Pr] "Lord! Why is it said so (that there are infinite synonyms for the inferior knowledge-possessing humans)?" [U] "Gautama! One inferior knowledge-possessing human is equal to another inferior knowledge-possessing human in terms of substance, equal in terms of regions, four-fold different in terms of comprehension, three-fold different in terms of state, six-fold different in terms of synonyms of color, smell, taste, and touch, and the two knowledges, equal in terms of synonyms of omniscient knowledge, six-fold different in terms of synonyms of scriptural knowledge, and six-fold different in terms of the three visions."

Fifth Special Term (Synonym) 1 [467 Q.] Bhagavan! How many synonyms are said for the Kevala Jnani humans? [467 A.] Gautama! (Their) infinite synonyms are said. [Q.] Bhagavan! Why is it said that 'infinite synonyms are said for the Kevala Jnani humans?' [A.] Gautama! One Kevala Jnani human is equal to another Kevala Jnani human in terms of substance, equal in terms of regions, is Chatur-Sthanapatit in terms of understanding, is Tri-Sthanapatit in terms of position, and is Shat-Sthanapatit in terms of synonyms of color, smell, taste and touch, and is equal in terms of synonyms of Kevala Jnana and synonyms of Kevala Darshan. 468. And in the same way as it is said about the synonyms of Kevala Jnani humans, it should be said about the synonyms of Kevala Darshani humans. The various aspects of the synonyms of the Vivechan humans are presented in the ten sutras (Su. 489 to 498) from the perspective of the inferior-superior-middle understanding, position, color etc. and the synonyms of the human with knowledge etc. The human with inferior understanding is Tri-Sthanapatit in terms of position, the human with inferior understanding is by rule of the number of years of life, in this regard he is Tri-Sthanapatit inferior-superior, that is, he is inferior-superior by the part of the innumerable-number and the number of times. The human with inferior understanding has three types of knowledge and two types of ignorance - the birth of a Tirthankara or an Anuttaraupapatik Deva with the non-repetitive Avadhi Jnana in the inferior understanding, then Avadhi Jnana is found even in the inferior understanding. Therefore, three types of knowledge are mentioned here, but the birth of a being who has come out of hell does not occur in the inferior understanding, because his nature is such. Therefore, Vibhang Jnana is not found in the inferior understanding; for this reason, only two types of ignorance are presented here (in the original text). The position of the human with superior understanding is inferior-superior-equal - the understanding of the humans with superior understanding is of three Gavyutis (kos), and their position is - the inferior Palyopama less than the innumerable part of three Palyopama and the superior is the full three Palyopama. The innumerable part of three Palyopama is the innumerable part of three Palyopama. Therefore, the human with the innumerable part of Palyopama less than three Palyopama is innumerable part less than the human with the position of three Palyopama, and the human with the full three Palyopama is innumerable part more in position than him. No other type of inferiority or superiority is possible in these. Perhaps there is also equality of position between any two such humans. The human with superior understanding has two types of knowledge and two types of prajna - the human with superior understanding has Mati and Shruta, these two types of knowledge or Matyajnan and Shrutajnan, these two types of ignorance and two types of Darshan. The reason for this is that the human with superior understanding

## Five Special Positions (Synonyms)

**[405]** There is no rule that a *Dhigyani* (one with knowledge) who is more knowledgeable than a *Madhyama Abhinibodhik Gyani* (one with moderate knowledge of liberation) is equal to them. Therefore, it is possible for them to be *Shatsthana Patit* (fallen in six ways) in their own position. Why are the *Jghanya* (inferior) and *Utkrisht* (superior) *Avadhigyani* (one with clairvoyance) humans *Visthana Patit* (fallen in four ways) in comparison to their potential?

* In humans, the most inferior *Avadhigyan* is not *Parabhavik* (brought from a previous life), but *Tadbhav* (of the same life). Even in the *Paryapt* (sufficient) state, it does not have the appropriate purity, and in the *Aparyapt* (insufficient) state, it is not possessed by a virtuous person. The *Utkrisht Avadhigyan* is possessed by a virtuous person. Therefore, the *Jghanya Avadhigyani* and *Utkrisht Avadhigyani* humans are *Visthana Patit* in comparison to their potential, but the *Madhyama Avadhigyani* (one with moderate clairvoyance) is *Chaturthana Patit* (fallen in four ways) because *Madhyama Avadhigyan* can be *Parabhavik* and therefore possible even in the *Aparyapt* state.

Why are *Avadhigyani* humans with *Jghanya* etc. qualities *Visthana Patit* in comparison to their position? *Avadhigyan* is not possible in humans with an infinite lifespan, it is only possible in those with a finite lifespan. Therefore, in *Jghanya*, *Utkrisht*, and *Madhyama Avadhigyani* humans, there can only be *Tristhana Patit* (fallen in three ways) inferiority in terms of finite lifespan, not *Chaturthana Patit*.

* *Jghanya* etc. *Manahparyavgyani* (one with knowledge of the mind) are *Visthana Patit* in terms of their position. *Manahparyavgyan* is possessed by virtuous humans, and virtuous humans have a finite lifespan. Therefore, *Jghanya*, *Madhyama*, and *Utkrisht Manahparyavgyani* humans are *Tristhana Patit* in terms of their position.

Why and how are *Kevalgyani* (omniscient) humans *Chaturthana Patit* in terms of their potential? This statement is in relation to *Kevali Samudghat* (the omniscient state). When a *Kevalgyani* human achieves *Kevali Samudghat*, they have an infinite times greater potential than other *Kevali* humans. In comparison, other *Kevali* humans have an infinitely lesser potential. Therefore, *Kevalgyani* humans are *Chaturthana Patit* in terms of their potential.

* In terms of their position, *Kevali* humans are *Tristhana Patit*. All *Kevali* humans have a finite lifespan, therefore, *Chaturthana Patit* inferiority is not possible. This is why they are *Tristhana Patit*.

**[466]** **Varanvyantar Jyotishka** (celestial beings) and **Vaimanik Deva** (aerial gods) are to be understood as having the same form as *Paryaya* (synonyms).

**[466-1]** **Vanamantara** (a period of time) is where the **Asurakumara** (sons of the Asuras) reside.

**[1]** In **Vanavyantar Deva** (celestial beings of the Vanamantara), the form of *Paryaya* is to be understood as being the same as the **Asurakumara**.

**[2]** Similarly, **Joisya Vaimanika** (aerial gods) are to be understood as being the same as the **Navaran Satane** (nine-headed beings) who reside in the **Tithanadi** (a specific place).

##  Translation:

**[Prajñāpanā Sūtra [466-2]]**

The same understanding should be applied to the categories of Jyotishkas and Vaimānika Devas (celestial beings). The key point is that they are tri-sthāna-patita (hina-adhika) in relation to their position in their own place. This concludes the categorization of the categories of the Jīva.

**Discussion - Vaṇavyantar, Jyotishka and Vaimānika Devas**

The categorization of the categories of Jyotishka and Vaimānika Devas is presented in the previous sūtra (499). The statement of the categories of all three types of Devas is made in an exaggerated manner, following the previous sūtra.

**Ajiva-Paryāya**

**[500 Pra.]**  Bhagavan! How many types of Ajiva-Paryāya are there?
**[500 U.]**  Gautama! There are two types of Ajiva-Paryāya. They are: (1) Rūvi-Ajiva-Paryāya and (2) Arūvi-Ajiva-Paryāya.

**[501 Pra.]**  Bhagavan! How many types of Arūvi-Ajiva-Paryāya are there?
**[501 U.]**  Gautama! There are ten types of Arūvi-Ajiva-Paryāya. They are: (1) Dharma-āstikāya, (2) Dharma-āstikāya's Deśa, (3) Dharma-āstikāya's Pradeśa, (4) Adharma-āstikāya, (5) Adharma-āstikāya's Deśa, (6) Adharma-āstikāya's Pradeśa, (7) Ākāśa-āstikāya, (8) Ākāśa-āstikāya's Deśa, (9) Ākāśa-āstikāya's Pradeśa, and (10) Addhā-samaya (time).

**[502 Pra.]**  Bhagavan! How many types of Rūvi-Ajiva-Paryāya are there?
**[502 U.]**  Gautama! There are four types of Rūvi-Ajiva-Paryāya. They are: (1) Skandha, (2) Skandha-Deśa, (3) Skandha-Pradeśa, and (4) Paramāṇu-pudgala.

**[503 Pra.]**  Bhagavan! Are they countable or uncountable?
**[503 U.]**  Gautama! They are neither countable nor uncountable.
**[503 Pra.]**  Bhagavan! Why are they said to be neither countable nor uncountable?

Page #440:
---------------------------
[Fifth Special Term (Synonym)] [407 Gotama! Infinite atomic pudgalas, infinite two-region skandhas, up to infinite ten-region skandhas, infinite countable-region skandhas, infinite uncountable-region skandhas, infinite infinite-region skandhas, from there, Gotama! Thus it is said that they are neither countable, nor uncountable, but infinite. [503 Pra.] Bhagavan! Are they (the aforementioned four types of ajiva synonyms) countable, uncountable, or infinite? [503 U] Gotama! They are neither countable nor uncountable, (but) infinite. [Pra.] Bhagavan! For what reason do you say that they (the aforementioned four types of ajiva synonyms) are neither countable, nor uncountable, (but) infinite? [U] Gotama! Atomic pudgalas are infinite; two-region skandhas are infinite, up to ten-region skandhas are infinite, countable-region skandhas are infinite, uncountable-region skandhas are infinite, and infinite-region skandhas are infinite. Gotama! For this reason, it is said that they are neither countable, nor uncountable, but infinite. 

Discussion - The distinction and sub-distinctions of ajiva synonyms and the number of synonyms are presented in these four sutras (Sutras 500 to 503). Ajiva synonyms, its two main types, and the distinctions of arupi and rupa ajiva synonyms, and the number of rupa ajiva synonyms are described. 

Definition of rupa and arupi ajiva synonyms - Rupa - that which has form. In addition to 'rupa' by the word 'rupa', 'gandha', 'rasa' and 'sparsa' are also understood by implication. The intention is that that which has form, rasa, gandha and sparsa is called rupa. Ajiva with form is called rupa ajiva. Rupa ajiva is only pudgala, therefore the synonym of rupa ajiva means the synonym of pudgala. Arupia means that which lacks form (rasa, gandha and sparsa), which is abstract. Therefore, the synonym of arupi ajiva means the synonym of abstract ajiva. 

Explanation of Dharma-astikaya etc. - Dharma-astikaya - the complete (undivided) mass (avayavi dravya) of Dharma-astikaya of uncountable regions. Dharma-astikaya-desa - half etc. part of Dharma-astikaya. Dharma-astikaya-pradesa - the smallest (most subtle) part of Dharma-astikaya. Similarly, one should understand the trikas of Adharma-astikaya and Akasa-astikaya etc. Praddhasa-samaya - the non-regional time dravya. 

Statement of dravyas or synonyms? - In the context of describing synonyms, it was appropriate to state synonyms here, but instead, dravyas have been stated because it gives the impression that synonyms and synonymous (dravya) are somehow inseparable. In fact, the mention of the terms Dharma-astikaya, Dharma-astikaya-desa etc. refers to the synonyms of those Dharma-astikaya etc. trikas and Praddhasa-samaya, not the dravyas. 

Statement related to synonyms of atomic pudgala etc. 504. "Bhanta! How many synonyms are there of atomic pudgalas?" "Gotama! There are infinite synonyms of atomic pudgalas." 1. Prajnapanamala. Vritti, Patranka 202 2. Ibid., Malaya. Vritti, Patranka 202

[408] [From the Prajñāpanā Sūtra, where, Bhante, is it said that the paramanu-pudgalas have infinite paryāyas? ]  Gautama! The paramanu-pudgalas are said to have infinite paryāyas. [Question] Bhante! For what reason is it said that the paramanu-pudgalas have infinite paryāyas? [Answer] Gautama! One paramanu-pudgala is equal to another paramanu-pudgala in terms of dravya, equal in terms of pradesa, and equal in terms of avagahana. However, in terms of sthiti, it is sometimes less, sometimes equal, and sometimes more. If it is less, then it is less by an asankhyāta-bhāga, or less by a sankhyāta-bhāga, or less by a sankhyāta-guṇa, or less by an asankhyāta-guṇa. If it is more, then it is more by an asankhyāta-bhāga, or more by a sankhyāta-bhāga, or more by a sankhyāta-guṇa, or more by an asankhyāta-guṇa. In terms of the paryāyas of the kṛṣṇa-varga, it is sometimes less, sometimes equal, and sometimes more. If it is less, then it is less by an ananta-bhāga, or less by an asankhyāta-bhāga, or less by a sankhyāta-bhāga, or less by a sankhyāta-guṇa, or less by an asankhyāta-guṇa, or less by an ananta-guṇa. If it is more, then it is more by an ananta-bhāga, or more by an asankhyāta-bhāga, or more by a sankhyāta-bhāga, or more by a sankhyāta-guṇa, or more by an asankhyāta-guṇa, or more by an ananta-guṇa. In the same way, it is ṣaṭ-sthāna-patita in terms of the paryāyas of the remaining (other than kāla and varṇa) varṇa, gandha, rasa, and sparsa. In terms of the sparsa, it is ṣaṭ-sthāna-patita in terms of the sparsa of śīta, uṣṇa, snigdha, and rūkṣa. Therefore, Gautama, it is said that the paramanu-pudgalas have infinite paryāyas. [504 Question] Bhante! How many paryāyas are there of the du-padeśīyas? [504 Answer] Gautama! There are infinite paryāyas. [Question] Bhante! For what reason is it said that the du-padeśīyas have infinite paryāyas? [Answer] Gautama! One du-padeśīya is equal to another du-padeśīya in terms of dravya, equal in terms of pradesa, and sometimes less, sometimes equal, and sometimes more in terms of avagahana. If it is less, then it is less in terms of pradesa. If it is more, then it is more in terms of pradesa. In terms of sthiti, it is ṣaṭ-sthāna-patita, and it is also ṣaṭ-sthāna-patita in terms of the remaining (other than varṇa) varṇa, gandha, rasa, and sparsa.

[Fifth Special Point (Synonym)] [409 [505 Q.] Lord! How many synonyms are said for the two-region aggregates? [505 A.] Gautama! Their synonyms are infinite. [Q.] Lord! Why is it said that the two-region aggregates have infinite synonyms? [A.] Gautama! One two-region aggregate is equal to another two-region aggregate in terms of substance, equal in terms of regions. In terms of penetration, it is perhaps inferior, perhaps equal, and perhaps superior. If inferior, then one region is inferior. If superior, then one region is superior. In terms of position, it is four-fold, in terms of color, etc., and in terms of the above four (cold, hot, smooth, and rough) touches, it is six-fold. 506. And so on for the three-region aggregates. The characteristic is that in terms of penetration, it is perhaps inferior, perhaps equal, and perhaps superior. If inferior, then it is one-region inferior or two-regions inferior. If superior, then it is one-region superior or two-regions superior. [506] In the same way, the statement about synonyms should be made for the three-region aggregates. The characteristic is that in terms of penetration, it is perhaps inferior, perhaps equal, and perhaps superior. If inferior, then it is one-region inferior or two-regions inferior. If superior, then it is one-region superior or two-regions superior. [507] In the same way, the statement about synonyms should be made up to the ten-region aggregates. The characteristic is that in terms of penetration, the regions should be increased (gradually); up to the ten-region aggregate, it is nine-region inferior.

The characteristic is that in terms of penetration, the regions should be increased (gradually); up to the ten-region aggregate, it is nine-region inferior. [508 Q.] Lord! How many synonyms are said for the numbered-region aggregates? [508 A.] Gautama! (Their) synonyms are infinite. [Q.] Lord! Why is it said that the numbered-region aggregates have infinite synonyms?

## Five Special Points (Synonyms)

**How can there be infinite synonyms in a Pradesh-less atom?** - The atom, which is called 'A-pradeshi' (without space), is only in relation to dravya (substance). In relation to time and emotion, it is not A-pradeshi or Niransh (without parts).

**Atom is Chatasparsht and Shat-sthana-patit** - An atom has only four out of eight sparshas (touch). These are: Sheeta (cold), Ushna (hot), Snigdha (smooth), and Rooksha (rough).

**Even in Asankhyat-pradeshi Skandha (aggregate), these four sparshas are present.** Some Anant-pradeshi Skandha (infinite space aggregate) also have four sparshas. Similarly, from Ek-pradesha-avgaadh (one space filled) to Sankhyat-pradesha-avgaadh Pudgal (Skandha), all have four sparshas. Therefore, from these perspectives, the atom should be considered Shat-sthana-patit (having six locations).

**Why and how is a Dwi-pradeshi Skandha (two space aggregate) considered Heena (less), Adhik (more), and Taly (equal) in terms of Avgaahana (filling)?** - When two Dwi-pradeshi Skandha are filled in two-two spaces or both in one-one space, then their Avgaahana is Taly (equal). But when one Dwi-pradeshi Skandha is filled in one space and the other in two spaces, then there is Heena-Adhikta (less-more) in terms of Avgaahana. The one filled in one space is called Ek-pradesha-heena-avgaahana (one space less filled) compared to the one filled in two spaces. While the one filled in two spaces is called Ek-pradesha-adhik-avgaahana (one space more filled) compared to the one filled in one space. There cannot be more Heena-Adhikta than this in Dwi-pradeshi Skandha.

**Heena-Adhikta in Tri-pradeshi Skandha (three space aggregate) in terms of Avgaahana:** - A three-space aggregate is called Tri-pradeshi Skandha. It can exist in one space, two spaces, or three spaces. It cannot be filled in more than three spaces. If there is Heena-Adhikta in Avgaahana of Tri-pradeshi Skandha in terms of location, then it can only be one or two spaces, not more.

**Heena-Adhikta in Dasha-pradeshi Skandha (ten space aggregate) in terms of Avgaahana:** - When two Tri-pradeshi Skandha are filled in three-three spaces, two-two spaces, or one-one space, then they are Taly (equal) in terms of Avgaahana. But when one Tri-pradeshi Skandha is Tri-pradesha-avgaadh (filled in three spaces) and the other is Dwi-pradesha-avgaadh (filled in two spaces), then it is Ek-pradesha-heena (one space less). If the other is Ek-pradesha-avgaadh (filled in one space), then it is Dwi-pradesha-heena (two spaces less). And the Tri-pradesha-avgaadh is Ek-pradesha-adhik (one space more) than Dwi-pradesha-avgaadh and Dwi-pradesha-adhik (two spaces more) than Ek-pradesha-avgaadh. In this way, by increasing one space at a time, the statement of Hani-vriddhi (loss-increase) should be made for Skandha from Chatur-pradeshi (four space aggregate) to Dasha-pradeshi (ten space aggregate) in terms of Avgaahana. From this perspective, Heena-Adhikta in Dasha-pradeshi Skandha will be said as follows: When Dasha-pradeshi Skandha is Heena (less), it is Ek-pradesha-heena (one space less), Dwi-pradesha-heena (two spaces less), and so on till Nava-pradesha-heena (nine spaces less). And when it is Adhik (more), it is Ek-pradesha-adhik (one space more), and so on till Nava-pradesha-adhik (nine spaces more).

**Anant-paryayata (infinite synonyms) of Sankhyat-pradeshi Skandha (countable space aggregate):** - Sankhyat-pradeshi Skandha is Taly (equal) to another Sankhyat-pradeshi Skandha in terms of Dravya (substance). It is Dravya, therefore it also has Anant-paryay (infinite synonyms), because every Dravya has Anant-paryay. In terms of Pradesh (space), it can be Heena (less), Taly (equal), or Adhik (more). If it is Heena or Adhik, then it is Sankhyat-bhag-heena (countable part less), Sankhyat-gun-heena (countable multiple less), or Sankhyat-bhag-adhik (countable part more), Sankhyat-gun-adhik (countable multiple more)...

[424] [From the Prajñāpanā [537-1 Pr.]] O Bhagavan! How many synonyms have been stated for the infinite-region aggregates (anantapradeśī skandha) of the lowest state (jghanya sthiti)? [537-1 U.] Gautama! Their synonyms are infinite. [Pr.] O Bhagavan! Why is it said that the infinite-region aggregates of the lowest state have infinite synonyms? [U.] Gautama! One infinite-region aggregate of the lowest state is equal to another infinite-region aggregate of the lowest state in terms of substance (dravya), is six-place-degenerated (ṣaṭsthānapatita) in terms of regions, is four-place-degenerated in terms of penetration (avagāhanā), is equal in terms of state, and is six-place-degenerated in terms of color, etc., and the eight contacts (aṣṭa sparśa). [2] And in the same way (evam ukkosathiye vi) / [537-2] One should understand the synonyms of the infinite-region aggregate of the highest state (utkṛṣṭa sthiti). [3] And in the same way (evam ceva) / for the infinite-region aggregates of the non-lowest, non-highest (madhyama) state, the statement regarding synonyms should be made in the same way. The special feature is that it is four-place-degenerated in terms of state. Discussion - The synonyms of the two-region (dvipradeśī) to infinite-region aggregates, which have specific penetration (avagāhanā) and state, from the lowest (jghanya) to the highest (utkṛṣṭa), have been presented in the thirteen sūtras (sū. 525 to 537). The synonyms of the atomic pudgalas (paramāṇu pudgala) and the two-region, three-region, up to a definite number of regions (yāvat saṅkhyātapradeśī), innumerable regions (asaṅkhyātapradeśī), and infinite-region aggregates (anantapradeśī skandha) of the lowest, highest, and middle penetration (avagāhanā) and state have been presented. The two-region aggregate of the lowest penetration is six-place-degenerated in terms of the four contacts - The two-region aggregates of the lowest penetration have only the four contacts of cold, hot, rough, and smooth. The other four contacts of harsh, hard, light (laghu), and heavy (guru) are not found in them. They have six-place-degeneration (ṣaṭsthānapatita hīnādhikta). There is no middle penetration in the two-region aggregate - A mass of two atoms is called a two-region aggregate. Its penetration is either in one region of space or at most in two regions of space. The penetration that occurs in one region is the lowest penetration, and the penetration that occurs in two regions is the highest. There is no penetration between these two. Therefore, there is no middle penetration. The four-region aggregates of the middle penetration have excess and deficiency - The lowest penetration of the four-region aggregate is in one region, and the highest penetration is in four regions. There are two types of middle penetration - in two regions and in three regions. Therefore, if a four-region aggregate of the middle penetration is deficient in penetration, it will be one-region deficient, and if it is more, it will be one-region excessive. There can be no more excess or deficiency in them.

[434] [The Prajñāpanā Sūtra states that the same should be said about the synonyms of those skandhas which have hot, oily, and rough sparsa [respectively].] Similarly, it should be said that in the atomic pudgala, all these are not opposed. The synonyms of the pudgalas of color, etc., which are endowed with the characteristics of vivēcanā, jayanyādi, etc., are presented in the sixteen sūtras (from sū. 538 to 553). In these sūtras, the synonyms of the atomic pudgalas of black, etc., color, smell, taste, and sparsa, from the two-region skandha to the countless-infinite region skandha, are presented. There are infinite-infinite alternatives in relation to the synonyms of black, etc., classes and smell, taste, and touch, i.e., five colors like black, blue, etc., two types of smells, five types of tastes, and eight types of sparsa. Accordingly, black, etc., are of infinite-infinite types. Explanation of the black, etc., color with inferior, superior, and medium qualities - The pudgala in which the least amount of black color is found is called the inferior quality black. Here, the word "guna" is used in the sense of part or quantity. Inferior quality means the least part. In other words, the pudgala in which there is only one degree of blackness - less than which blackness is not possible - should be understood as inferior quality black. The one in which the most parts of blackness are found is the superior quality black. The black which is more than one part of blackness and less than one part from the most (final) blackness is called the medium quality black. The same should be understood about the blue, etc., classes, and smells, tastes, and touches, which are endowed with inferior, superior, and medium qualities, like the black color. In relation to the avagahana, the two-region skandha is more or less - If one two-region skandha is less than another two-region skandha in relation to the avagahana, then it can be one region less avagahana, and if it is more, then it can be one region more avagahana. The meaning is that in the avagahana of the two-region skandha, more than one region less or more avagahana is not possible. From the two-region skandha to the ten-region skandha, the statement of their synonyms is the same as that of the two-region skandha, but the number of regions should be increased in them. That is, from the two-region skandha to the ten-region skandha, the increase of nine regions should be stated. The inferior quality black, in relation to the number of regions, the region, and the avagahana, is two-place-degenerate in relation to the two-place-degenerate regions, i.e., it is either without number-part or without number-quality, or it is more than the number-part or more than the number-quality. Similarly, it is two-place-degenerate in relation to the avagahana. The effect of mutually opposite smell, taste, and touch in the atomic pudgala - The atomic pudgala which has a fragrant smell does not have a foul smell, and the one which has a foul smell does not have a fragrant smell, because the atom is only of one smell. Therefore, where one smell is stated, the absence of the other smell should be stated. Similarly, where one taste is stated, the absence of other tastes should be understood. That is, where there is bitter taste, there are no other tastes like pungent, etc., because 1. Prajñāpanā Sūtra Prameyabodhinī Ṭīkā Bhā. 2, p. 885-886 2. Prajñāpanā Sūtra; Pra. Bo. Ṭīkā Bhā. 2, p. 887 to 890.

## Fifth Special Point (Synonym Point) [435]

There is mutual contradiction in them. Similarly, where there is a statement of cold touch in a pudgala atom, there should not be a statement of hot touch, because these two touches are mutually contradictory. Similarly, one should understand about other touches, such as: smooth and rough, soft and harsh, light and heavy are mutually contradictory touches. These mutually contradictory touches do not reside in the same atom. Therefore, they should not be mentioned in the atom.

## Explanation of the Synonym Form of the Various Expectations of the General Pudgala Skandhas like Jghanya etc. 554. [1]

[554-1 Pr.] Bhagavan! How many synonyms are there for the Jghanya-pradeshi Skandhas? [554-1 U.] Gautama! (There are) infinite synonyms (for them). [Pr.] Bhagavan! For what reason is it said (that there are infinite synonyms for the Jghanya-pradeshi Skandhas)? [U.] Gautama! One Jghanya-pradeshi Skandha is equal to another Jghanya-pradeshi Skandha in terms of substance, equal in terms of regions, possibly inferior in terms of penetration, possibly equal, and possibly superior. If inferior, then it is one region less, and if superior, then it is one region more. In terms of position, it is four-positioned, and in terms of color, smell, taste, and the four touches above, it is six-positioned.

[2] [554-2 Pr.] Bhagavan! How many synonyms are there for the Utkrushta-pradeshi Skandhas? [554-2 U.] Gautama! (There are) infinite synonyms (for them). [Pr.] Bhagavan! For what reason do you say this (that there are infinite synonyms for the Utkrushta-pradeshi Skandhas)? [U.] Gautama! One Utkrushta-pradeshi Skandha is equal to another Utkrushta-pradeshi Skandha in terms of substance, equal in terms of regions, four-positioned in terms of penetration, four-positioned in terms of position, and six-positioned in terms of color, smell, taste, and the eight touches above.

The *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* is equivalent to the *Pradeśa* (region) in terms of *dravya* (substance), but is *ṣaṭ-sthāna-patita* (six-fold different) in terms of *pradeśa* (region), *catur-sthāna-patita* (four-fold different) in terms of *avagāhana* (penetration), and *catur-sthāna-patita* (four-fold different) in terms of *sthiti* (position). However, it is *ṣaṭ-sthāna-patita* (six-fold different) in terms of *varṇa* (color) and other *aṣṭa-sparśa* (eight contacts). [3]

"Bhagavan! How many *paryāya* (categories) are there for *skandha* (aggregates) in the *ajghannya-anutkṛṣṭa* (medium) *pradeśa* (region)?" [554-3 Pr.] "Gautama! There are infinite *paryāya* (categories)." [Pr.] "Bhagavan! Why is that said (that there are infinite *paryāya* (categories) for *skandha* (aggregates) in the *madhyama-pradeśa* (medium region)?" [U.] "Gautama! One *madhyama-pradeśa* (medium region) *skandha* (aggregate) is equivalent to another *madhyama-pradeśa* (medium region) *skandha* (aggregate) in terms of *dravya* (substance), *ṣaṭ-sthāna-patita* (six-fold different) in terms of *pradeśa* (region), *catur-sthāna-patita* (four-fold different) in terms of *avagāhana* (penetration), *catur-sthāna-patita* (four-fold different) in terms of *sthiti* (position), and *ṣaṭ-sthāna-patita* (six-fold different) in terms of *varṇa* (color) and other *aṣṭa-sparśa* (eight contacts)." 555. [1]

"Bhagavan! How many *paryāya* (categories) are there for *pudgala* (particles) with *jghannya-avagāhana* (inferior penetration)?" [555-1 Pr.] "Gautama! There are infinite *paryāya* (categories)." [Pr.] "Bhagavan! Why is that said (that there are infinite *paryāya* (categories) for *pudgala* (particles) with *jghannya-avagāhana* (inferior penetration)?" [U.] "Gautama! One *pudgala* (particle) with *jghannya-avagāhana* (inferior penetration) is equivalent to another *pudgala* (particle) with *jghannya-avagāhana* (inferior penetration) in terms of *dravya* (substance), *ṣaṭ-sthāna-patita* (six-fold different) in terms of *pradeśa* (region), equivalent in terms of *avagāhana* (penetration), *catur-sthāna-patita* (four-fold different) in terms of *sthiti* (position), and *ṣaṭ-sthāna-patita* (six-fold different) in terms of *varṇa* (color) and other *sparśa* (contacts) above." [2] "The same should be said about *pudgala* (particles) with *utkṛṣṭa-avagāhana* (superior penetration). The only difference is that they are equivalent in terms of *sthiti* (position)." [555-2]

[Q] "O Venerable One! Why is it said that there are infinite synonyms for the middle-depth pudgalas?" [A] "Gautama! One middle-depth pudgala is equal to another middle-depth pudgala in terms of substance.

[438] The statement regarding the permutations of the pudgalas in the state of [3] prajahanna-manukkosathi should be said in the same way.  The special point is that it is also chaturthanapatit in relation to the state. [556-3] The statement regarding the permutations of the pudgalas in the state of ajghannya-anutkrusht (madhyama) should also be said in the same way. The special point is that it is also chaturthanapatit in relation to the state. 557. [1] Bhagavan! How many permutations of pudgalas are there in the jahannaguna-kala? [557-1 U] Gautama! (There are) infinite permutations. [Pr] Bhagavan! Why is it said that there are infinite permutations of pudgalas in the jahannaguna-kala? [U] Gautama! One pudgala in the jahannaguna-kala is equal to another pudgala in the jahannaguna-kala in terms of dravya, it is shatthanapatit in terms of pradesha, it is chaturthanapatit in terms of avagahana, it is chaturthanapatit in terms of state, it is equal in terms of the permutations of the krishnavarna, and it is shatthanapatit in terms of the permutations of the remaining varna, gandha, rasa, and sparsa.  O Gautama! For this reason, it is said that there are infinite permutations of pudgalas in the jahannaguna-kala. [557-1 Pr] Bhagavan! How many permutations of pudgalas are there in the jahannaguna-kala? [557-1 U] Gautama! (There are) infinite permutations. [Pr] Bhagavan! Why is it said that there are infinite permutations of pudgalas in the jahannaguna-kala? [U] Gautama!

O Gautama! For this reason, it is said that there are infinite permutations of pudgalas in the jahannaguna-kala. [557-2] The statement regarding the permutations of the pudgalas in the utkrushtguna-kala should be understood in the same way. [557-3] The statement regarding the permutations of the pudgalas in the prajahanna-manukkoshaguna-kala should also be said in the same way. The special point is that it is shatthanapatit in its own state. [558] Just as the statement regarding the permutations of the krishnavarna has been said, the statement regarding the permutations of the remaining varna, gandha, rasa, and sparsa should be said in the same way, until it is said that the pudgala in the state of ajghannya-anutkrusht (madhyama) guna is shatthanapatit in its own state.  This is the statement regarding the permutations of the ruvigrajivapudgala.  This is the statement regarding the permutations of the ajivapudgala.  //  The fifth special chapter (permutation chapter) of the Bhagavati is complete.  //  [558] Just as the statement regarding the permutations of the krishnavarna has been said, the statement regarding the permutations of the remaining varna, gandha, rasa, and sparsa should be said in the same way, until it is said that the pudgala in the state of ajghannya-anutkrusht (madhyama) guna is shatthanapatit in its own state.  This is the statement regarding the permutations of the ruvigrajivapudgala.

## Fifth Special Chapter (Chapter of Categories) [439]

This is the presentation of the categories of non-living things (Ajiva). Thus, the description related to the categories of non-living things is also complete. 

The five sutras (Sutras 554 to 558) present the categories of the gross, medium, and subtle provincial skandhas, as well as the categories of the gross, medium, and subtle qualities, the categories of perception, position, and the categories of black, etc., and the categories of smell, taste, and touch, from different perspectives. 

The medium quality black pudgala in its own place can fall into any of the six places. There can be infinite parts or infinite qualities less than, equal to, or more than another medium quality black pudgala, because there are infinite possibilities of medium quality. Similarly, all the colors, etc., up to touch, with medium quality, fall into any of the six places in their own place. 

Why is the position of the infinite provincial skandha with excellent perception considered to be the same? The infinite provincial skandha with excellent perception pervades all the worlds. It can either be the non-conscious great skandha or the karma skandha in the state of the omniscient's liberation. Both of these have only four times: the time of the rod, the time of the door, the time of the front, and the time of the filling. Therefore, it is said to have the same position.

Page #473:
---------------------------
This is the sixth *vyutkrantipad* of the *Prajnapana Sutra*. The subject of this *pad* is the *vyutkranti* of various types of beings, i.e., discussing questions related to their origin in different *gatis* and their transition from one *gati* to another. In short, this *pad* examines the movement and counter-movement of beings. This examination is presented in this *pad* through the following *paths* (1) *Dvadash Dvar* (absence of *upapat* and *udvartana*), (2) *Chavishti Dvar* (absence of *upapat* and *udvartana* of the species of beings), (3) *Santara Dvar* (consideration of the *santara* and continuous *upapat* and *udvartana* of the species of beings), (4) *Ekasamaya Dvar* (consideration of how many beings are born and die at the same time), (5) *Kutah Dvar* (description of how beings are born after death in those *paryayas*), (6) *Udvartana Dvar* (consideration of which *bhavas* a being goes to after death from the present *bhavas*), (7) *Parabhavikayushya Dvar* (thinking about when a being binds the lifespan of the upcoming new *bhavas* in the present *bhavas*?), and (8) *Aakarsh Dvar* (6 types of lifespan binding, in how many *aakarsh* does a being bind the lifespan karma specific to its species, etc.? and the consideration of the few and many beings with less and more *aakarsh*). The first *dvar* is named 'Baras' (twelve) because it includes the *upapatavirah* (the beings of hell, animal, human, and god are born in those forms, there is no absence of birth in between) and *udvartana virah* (the beings of hell, animal, human, and god die, there is no absence of death in between) of the beings of the four *gatis* of hell, animal, human, and god, which is the lowest one moment and the highest 12 *muhurtas*. The second *dvar* is named 'Chauvisa' (twenty-four) because from the perspective of the species of the *gatis* of hell, etc., the *upapatavirah* and *udvartana virah* of the first hell is the lowest one (a) *Pannavanasutta* (original text with commentary) Bha. 1, p. 163 (b) *Prajnapana Sutra* M.

---------------------------
## Sixth Transcendental Step: Primary [441]

This step deals with time and the auspicious 24 Muhurtas. Although the duration of the time without rebirth (Upapata-viraha-kal) and the time without liberation (Udvartana-viraha-kal) is not 24 Muhurtas for all species of the four types of beings, the time without rebirth and liberation for the first hell, Ratnaprabha, is indeed 24 Muhurtas. Therefore, considering this as the starting point, this step is named "Twenty-four".

## Third Intermediate Step:

This step explains whether the rebirth and liberation of beings in different species occur continuously or with interruptions. It clarifies from the perspective of Anekanta that except for the earth-bodied and other single-sensed beings, the rebirth and liberation of all other beings occur continuously and also with interruptions.

Although this is discussed in the Antar-anugam-prakaran of the Shatkhandagama, the focus there is on the "interruption" in the sense of when a being, after wandering through different states, returns to the same state. It also considers whether there is an interruption with respect to multiple beings and how long beings can remain in hell, etc., with respect to different beings.

## Fourth Step:

This step explains how many beings are reborn and liberated at a particular time in different species of beings with different levels of intellect. It states that except for the plant-bodied and earth-bodied and other single-sensed beings, the rebirth and liberation of all other beings occur in a single time period in the lowest number of one, two, or three, and in the highest number, in countless numbers. For plant-bodied beings, it is continuously countless in their own place and continuously countless in other places, and for earth-bodied and other beings, it is continuously countless.

## Fifth Step:

This step describes the progress of beings. It determines which beings die and are reborn in which species of the four types of beings. In other words, it determines which beings are capable of being reborn in which places after death.

## Sixth Step:

This step describes the liberation of beings, i.e., their departure. It determines where beings go after death (in which state and womb) and where they are reborn. Although the fifth step, when read in reverse, clarifies the subject of the sixth step, as it explains where beings come from, which in turn clarifies where they go after death, this sixth step is introduced for clear understanding.

## Seventh Step:

This step explains when the lifespan of the future birth (Bhava) is determined for a being. In other words, it explains how much of the current lifespan remains or how much has passed when the lifespan of the future birth is determined. Hell beings, gods, and beings with countless years of lifespan (humans and animals) determine their future lifespan six months in advance, while all other beings determine it...

Page #475:
---------------------------
[442] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra (except for the Charamaśarīrī and Uttama Puruṣa in humans)] Both Sopākram and Nirupākram bind the lifespan in both ways. Nirupākramī beings bind the lifespan of the next birth when one-third of the current lifespan remains, and Sopākramī beings bind the lifespan of the next birth when one-third of the current lifespan, or one-third of that division, or one-third of the division of that division remains. * This is how the pattern of binding the lifespan of the next birth is described. * In the Aṣṭamadvāra, it is explained that there are six types of lifespan binding: Jātināmanidhattāyu, Gatīnāmanidhattāyu, Sthitīnāmanidhattāyu, Avagāhanānāmanidhattāyu, Pradeshānāmanidhattāyu, and Anubhāvanāmanidhattāyu. This clarifies which beings bind which specific lifespan with how many attractions. It is described that ordinary beings and beings from the Nairyāyika to the Vaimānika realms bind lifespan with one, two, three, or up to eight attractions, which are the lowest and highest, respectively. * Finally, the rarity of those who bind lifespan with one to eight attractions is discussed. 1.

The sixth chapter of the Vyutkrantipad, the Vyutkrantipad, has eight gates: 1. Twelve (Barah), 2. Twenty-four (Chaubis), 3. With interval (Santara), 4. One time (Eksamya), 5. From where? (Kattoy), 6. Udvartana, 7. Life related to the future (Parabhaviyaum), and 8. Attraction (Agaresha). 

This chapter discusses the eight gates of the Vyutkrantipad. The first gate, the twelve gate, describes the duration of the absence of Uppaat and Udvartana in the hellish realms. 

**Question:**  O Bhagavan! For how long is the hellish realm considered to be devoid of Uppaat? 

**Answer:**  Gautama! The minimum duration is one time (Eksamya) and the maximum duration is twelve Muhurta. 

**Question:**  O Bhagavan! For how long is the animal realm considered to be devoid of Uppaat? 

**Answer:**  Gautama! The minimum duration is one time (Eksamya) and the maximum duration is twelve Muhurta. 

**Question:**  O Bhagavan! For how long is the human realm considered to be devoid of Uppaat? 

**Answer:**  Gautama! The minimum duration is one time (Eksamya) and the maximum duration is twelve Muhurta.

## Sixth Vyutkantpad [445 Discussion - First Twelve (Baras = Twelve) Doors: The Absence of Descent and Ascent in the Four Paths]

This section, comprising nine sutras (from 560 to 568), discusses the duration of the absence of descent and ascent in the four paths (hell, animal, human, and god) and the fifth path (liberation). It also explains the duration of the absence of descent and ascent in the lowest and highest forms of these paths.

**Why is the singular form used for the four paths, including hell?**

Niryagati (hell) refers to the state of being born in hell due to the ripening of the karma called Narakakarma. Similarly, the same understanding applies to the other paths like animal, human, and god. This state of being born in a particular path is unique to each path, distinct from the general state of existence. The state of being born in hell is pervasive across all seven earths. Therefore, the singular form is used for each of the four paths, including hell.

**Descent and its Absence:**

Descent refers to being born in hell, animal, human, god, or liberation after dying in another path. The absence of descent in hell means the period during which no new being is born in hell. In other words, the period during which hell remains devoid of new births is the absence of descent in hell. The same understanding applies to the other paths.

The four paths remain devoid of descent for a minimum of one time period and a maximum of twelve muhurtas. After twelve muhurtas, a new being is born in one of the four paths.

**Absence of Descent in Liberation:**

The absence of descent in liberation is described as the highest form. This is because after a being attains liberation, it is possible that no new being attains liberation for a maximum of six months. After six months, a new being is bound to attain liberation.

**Why not twenty-four muhurtas?**

It will be explained later that the absence of descent is twenty-four muhurtas. However, the twelve muhurtas mentioned here refer to the general absence of descent in hell. When discussing the absence of descent in each individual hell earth, like Ratnaprabha, it is twenty-four muhurtas. The same understanding applies to the other paths.

**Ascent and its Absence:**

Ascent refers to leaving a particular path, like hell. The question is, how long does it take for no being to leave a particular path? This period is called the absence of ascent.

The absence of ascent in the four paths is a maximum of twelve muhurtas. This does not apply to liberation because a being who attains liberation never leaves it. Therefore, there is no ascent in liberation, and consequently, no absence of ascent. There is always an absence of ascent in liberation because the state of liberation is eternal and unchanging. Liberated beings remain liberated forever.

Sixth Vyutkrantapad } [453 608. And just as the absence of Uppapat (birth) has been explained for the Siddhas, in the same way, the absence of Udvartana (ascension) should also be stated for the devatas (gods) who are not Uttaropapattik (those who do not experience higher births).  The special point is that in the description of the Jyotishka (celestial) and Vaimanika (aerial) devatas, the word 'Chyavan' should be used (instead of Udvartana).  Discussion - Second Chaturvishti Dvara: The absence of Uppapat and Udvartana for the Nairyika (hellish beings) to the Anuttaroupapattik (those who do not experience higher births) has been described in the 40 sutras (from sutra 566 to 608) presented in the Praroopana (formulation).  Various special Naraka (hellish), Tiryanch (animal), Manushya (human) and Deva (divine) beings, devoid of Uppapat and Udvartana, have been described in these sutras.  Earth-bodied etc. are always devoid of Uppapat - Earth-bodied etc. beings are born continuously.  There is no time when Earth-bodied beings do not experience Uppapat.  Therefore, they are said to be devoid of Uppapat.  Jyotishka and Vaimanika devatas do not experience Udvartana - The word 'Chyavan' should be used for both these types of devatas.  Chyavan means to come down.  Jyotishka and Vaimanika are above this earth, therefore, devatas die and come down from above, they do not go up from below.  Third Santardvara: Continuous description of the birth and Udvartana of Nairyika to Siddhas - 606.  Bhanta! Are Nairyika born Santara (gradually) or Nirantara (continuously)?  Gautama!

[625] In the same way as the Uppapata (has been described), so also should the Udvartana (be described) from the Nairyikas up to the Vaimanikas, excluding the Siddhas. It is important to note that the term 'Chyavana' should be used (as an expression of respect) for the Jyotishkas and Vaimanikas. Third Interval Gate.

**Discussion:** The third Interval Gate - the continuous description of the origin and Udvartana from the Râyikas to the Siddhas - is presented in these 17 Sutras (from Sutra 606 to 625). The origin and Udvartana of the twenty-four Dandakas and the Siddhas, from the Nairyikas to the Vaimanika Devas, have been described in terms of both Interval and Continuous.

**Conclusion:** Except for the five types of Ekendriya beings, from the Prithvikaayikas to the Vanaspatikaayikas, all worldly and Siddha beings experience both Interval and Continuous origin and Udvartana. However, the Siddhas experience Interval origin but never Udvartana.

**Explanation of Interval and Continuous Origin:** To be born with an interruption, leaving some time in between, is Interval origin. To be born continuously without any interruption, with no time gap in between, is Continuous origin.

**Fourth One-Time Gate:** Description of the number of beings in the twenty-four Dandakas and the Siddhas who are born and experience Udvartana in one time period.

[626] "O Venerable One! How many Nairyikas are born in one time period?" [626] "Gautama! The minimum number is one, two, or three, and the maximum number is a countable or an uncountable number."

[627] "The same should be understood up to the seventh Naraka-Prithvi."

They are liberated (die) in numbers ranging from one, two, or three at the lowest, and countless at the highest." / [638] Just as it has been said about the Upapat, in the same way, it should be said about the liberation of the Siddhas and the Anuttaroupapathika Devas. / It is important to note that for the Jyotishka and Vaimanika Devas, the term 'chyavan' should be used (instead of liberation). - Fourth Ekasamaya Dvara / / 4 / / Discussion - Fourth Ekasamaya Dvara: The thirteen Sutras (Sutras 626 to 638) present a model for the number of births and liberations of the twenty-four Dandakavarti Jivas and Siddhas at one time. This model also explains the number of births and liberations of all worldly beings and the attainment of Siddhi by the Siddhas at one time. Explanation of the Swasthana-Upapat and Parasthan-Upapat of the Vanaspatikaayika: Here, Swasthana should be understood as 'Vanaspatibhava'. The Vanaspatikaayika Jivas who die and are reborn as Vanaspatikaayika again, their birth is called Swasthana-Upapat. When a Jiva of the Prithvikaaya or any other Kaya is born as a Vanaspatikaayika, then their birth is called Parasthan-Upapat. / In Swasthana, countless Vanaspatikaayika Jivas are born continuously at every moment; because in every Nigoda, countless parts are continuously born and liberated, and these Vanaspatikaayika are infinite. / In Parasthan-Upapat, countless Jivas are born continuously at every moment, because the Jivas of the Prithvikaaya etc. are countless. / The meaning is that...

The special point is that one should deny (their origin) from the terrestrial five-sensed Tiryanchas. [2] According to this (previous) statement, if they (the Dhumaprābhā-pṛthvī Nārikas) arise from the five-sensed Tiryancha yonis, then do they arise from the aquatic five-sensed Tiryanchas, or from the terrestrial five-sensed Tiryanchas? Or do they arise from the aerial five-sensed Tiryanchas? [645-2 Pr.] Gautama! (They) arise from the aquatic five-sensed Tiryanchas, but not from the terrestrial five-sensed Tiryanchas, nor from the aerial five-sensed Tiryanchas. [3] Bhagavan! If (they) arise from humans, then do they arise from the Karmabhūmi humans, or from the Akarmabhūmi humans, or from the Antaravīpa humans? [645-3 Pr.] Gautama! (They) arise from the Karmabhūmi humans, but not from the Akarmabhūmi humans, nor from the Antaravīpa humans. [4] Bhagavan! If (they) arise from the Karmabhūmi humans, then do they arise from the Sankhyejjavāsau humans, or from the Asankhyejjavāsau humans? [645-4 Pr.] Gautama! (They) arise from the Sankhyejjavāsau humans, but not from the Asankhyejjavāsau humans.

## Sixth Transmigration Stage [469 645.4 Pr.]  

Lord! If the beings of the Karmabhoomi are born from human beings, are they born from human beings with a limited lifespan or from human beings with an unlimited lifespan? [645-4 U.]  

Gautama! They are born from human beings with a limited lifespan, but not from human beings with an unlimited lifespan. [5]  

Are the beings of the Tamas Prabha Prithvi (the sixth hell) born from those who have attained the state of "Jati Sankejjavasa" (the state of having attained the knowledge of their own caste) or from those who have not attained this state? Are they born from those who have not attained this state? [645-5 Pr.]  

(Lord!) If they are born from human beings with a limited lifespan, are they born from those who are "Paryapta" (sufficient) or from those who are "Aparyapta" (insufficient)? [645-5 U.]  

Gautama! They are born from those who are "Paryapta", not from those who are "Aparyapta". [6]  

If they are born from "Paryapta" human beings with a limited lifespan, are they born from women? Or are they born from men? Or are they born from eunuchs? [645-6 Pr.]  

Gautama! They are born from women, they are born from men, and they are born from eunuchs. [645-6 U.]  

646. Lord! From where are the beings of the Adhasaptami (the seventh hell) born? [646 Pr.]  

Gautama! The description of their birth should be understood in the same way (as the birth of the beings of the sixth hell). The only difference is that their birth from women should be prohibited.  

647. The "Asanjni" (those who are unconscious) are certainly in the first (hell), the "Siri Siva" (reptiles) are in the second (hell), the "Pakkhi" (birds) are in the third (hell). The "Siha" (lions) are in the fourth (hell), the "Uraga" (snakes) are in the fifth (hell). The "Itthiya" (women) are in the sixth (hell), the "Maccha" (fish) and "Manuya" (human beings) are in the seventh (hell). This is the ultimate description of the hells.

470]  /  In the Prajñāpanā Sūtra, it is stated that:  Snakes are born up to the fifth earth, women up to the sixth (hellish earth), and fish and humans (men) up to the seventh (hellish) earth.  One should understand that this is the ultimate (highest) birth in the hellish earths (for the aforementioned beings).  /  183-184  /  /  648.  "O Venerable Gautama! From where are the Asura-kumāras born?"  "Gautama!

"In the same way, one should speak about the birth of the Thanīya-kumāras."  /  650.  [1]  "O Venerable Gautama! From where are the Pṛthvīkāyika beings born? Are they born from the Nairyāyikas, from the Tiryanchas, from humans, or from the Devas?"  "Gautama! They are not born from the Nairyāyikas, but they are born from the Tiryancha-yonis, from the Manusya-yonis, and also from the Devas."  /  [2]  "If they are born from the Tiryancha-yonis, are they born from the Ekendriya-tiryancha-yonis, up to the Panchendriya-tiryancha-yonis?"  "Gautama! They are born from the Ekendriya-tiryancha-yonis, up to the Panchendriya-tiryancha-yonis."

[11] If they are born from humans, are they born from the Sammūcchima humans or the Garbhaja humans? [650-11 Pr.] (O Bhagavan!) [650-11 U.] Gautama! The earth-bodied beings are born from both (Sammūcchima and Garbhaja).

The birth of *tejaskaayik* (fire-bodied) and *vaayukaayik* (air-bodied) beings occurs only in the *tiryanch* (animal) realm. The birth of *tiryanch* (animals) with five senses occurs in the *narak* (hell), *tiryanch* (animal), human and *dev* (heavenly) realms, especially in the *vaimanik* (aerial) gods up to the *sahasrar* (thousand) *kalp* (eon). The birth of humans occurs in all places of the four realms. The birth of *vaimanik* (aerial) gods from *sanatkumar* (a celestial being) to *sahasrar* (thousand) *dev* (heavenly beings) occurs in the *garbhaja* (born from the womb), *sankhyatavarshayushk* (having a lifespan measured in years), *tiryanch* (animals) with five senses and humans.

##  How much of their lifespan remains when beings of the four gati (types of motion) bind their lifespan for the next birth?

This topic is discussed in seven sutras (677 to 683) of the **Prajnapana Sutra**. The meaning of **Parabhavikayushyadwar** is: how much of their current lifespan remains when beings in the hellish and other realms bind their lifespan for the next birth (future birth)?

**Explanation of Sopakram and Nirupkram:**

* **Sopakram** is the lifespan that is affected by **upkram** (violent events).
* **Nirupkram** is the lifespan that is not affected by **upkram**.

**Upkram** refers to violent events like poison, weapons, fire, water, etc., that can cause premature death. 

* **Sopakram lifespan** is the lifespan that is cut short by **upkram** before the full lifespan allotted by karma is experienced. This is also called **Akalamrityu** (premature death), **Sopakram lifespan**, or **Apvartaaniya lifespan**.
* **Nirupkram lifespan** is the lifespan that is not cut short by **upkram** and is experienced fully until the end of the lifespan allotted by karma. This is also called **Nirupkram lifespan** or **Anpavartaneya lifespan**.

**Nirupkram lifespan** is found in **Aupapatik** (hellish and heavenly realms), **Charmashareee** (those with a physical body), **Uttama Purusha** (the best of humans), and **Asankhyatavarshajeevi** (humans and animals with an immeasurable lifespan).

**Conclusion:**

* **Aupapatik** and **Asankhyatavarshajeevi** beings have **Nirupkram lifespan**.
* They bind their lifespan for the next birth when 6 months of their current lifespan remain. This includes **Nairyik** (those who live in the hellish realms), all types of **Devas** (heavenly beings), and **Asankhyatavarshajeevi** humans and animals.
* Beings from **Prithvikaayika** (earth-bodied) to **Manushya** (humans) have both **Sopakram** and **Nirupkram lifespan**.
* Those with **Nirupkram lifespan** bind their lifespan for the next birth when two-thirds of their current lifespan has passed and one-third remains.
* Those with **Sopakram lifespan** may bind their lifespan for the next birth when one-third of their current lifespan remains, but this is not a fixed rule.
* If they do not bind their lifespan at that time, they will bind it when two-thirds of the remaining one-third has passed, leaving one-third of the one-third remaining.
* This can continue, with the lifespan being bound when one-third of the remaining one-third of the one-third remains, and so on.
* Some scholars believe that **Sopakram lifespan** beings may bind their lifespan for the next birth when one-ninth of their current lifespan remains, or even when one-twenty-seventh of their current lifespan remains.

## Sixth Inverted Term | / 493 Discussion-Textual Excellence: All beings have six types of lifespan bonds, their number of excellences and their scarcity-presented in the eighth gate, in nine sutras (from 684 to 692), three facts are presented: 1. The six types of lifespan bonds of beings in general, from hellish to celestial beings / 2. The representation of the bond of beings in general and hellish to celestial beings, by the six types of lifespan bonds, with the lowest being one, two or three, and the highest being many excellences. 3. The scarcity of beings who bind each lifespan bond with the lowest and highest excellences. The nature of the six types of lifespan bonds: (1) **Jati-nama-nidhattay** - From the Jain perspective, there are five types of beings, starting with one sense organ. They are a specific form of the after-effect of the name karma, the lifespan that is bound with that 'jati-nama' is called 'jati-nama-nidhattay'. 'Nishaka' means - a specific creation for experiencing karma particles. That creation is as follows - leaving aside its unimpeded time (because karma particles are not experienced in unimpeded time, therefore there is no creation of karma particles in it /) first, in the lowest internal-momentary state, there is a lot of matter. In the karma particles taken in one excellence, there are many in the lowest state. The rest, from one time onwards, there is a special deficiency (less) matter in the internal-momentary state, and as far as the highest state, there are the most excellent (special deficiency, i.e., all deficiency, the least) particles. (2) **Gati-nama-nidhattay** - There are four types of motion - hellish motion, animal motion, human motion and celestial motion / The name karma in the form of motion is 'gati-nama'. The lifespan bound with them is called 'gati-nama-nidhattay' / (3) **Sthiti-nama-nidhattay** - To remain in that particular existence (with the strength of lifespan) is called 'sthiti' / The name (name karma) that is primarily about 'sthiti' is 'sthiti-nama' / The lifespan bound with it is called 'sthiti-nama-nidhattay'. The one who remains in the existence in which he arises is 'sthiti-nama', which is different from motion, species and the five bodies. (4) **Avagahana-nama-nidhattay** - The one in which the being experiences is called 'avagahana'. The audarika etc. bodies, the audarika etc. name karma that creates them - 'avagahana-nama' / The lifespan bound with it is called 'avagahana-nama-nidhattay'. (5) **Pradesha-nama-nidhattay** - 'Pradesha' means - karma atoms / They are experienced through 'pradesha-samkrama' (transition of karma atoms) / The name (name karma) that is primarily about them (pradeshas) is called 'pradesha-nama' / The meaning is that the one who experiences in that existence through 'pradesha' without the ripening of the result is called 'pradesha-nama' / The lifespan bound with the said 'pradesha-nama' is called 'pradesha-nama-nidhattay'. (6) **Anubhava-nama-nidhattay** - 'Anubhava' means - result / Here, the result that has attained the excellence state is taken / The name (name karma) that is primarily about that 'anubhava-vipak' is called 'anubhava-nama'. The meaning is that the name karma that is experienced in that existence with intense result is called 'anubhava-nama'. For example, in hellish existence, there are name karmas like inauspicious color, smell, taste, touch, attack, bad voice, unworthiness, bad reputation etc. Therefore, the lifespan bound with 'anubhava-nama' is called 'anubhava-nama-nidhattay'. In the present, to show the dominance of lifespan karma, jati, gati, sthiti, avagahana name karmas...

---------------------------
(The Prajapana Sutra and others are referred to as qualifications of lifespan / The emergence of lifespan in hell and other realms leads to the emergence of karma like caste, etc. / Otherwise, it does not, therefore, lifespan is the primary factor here. 'Attraction' is defined as the acquisition of karma particles by a living being through a specific type of effort / These sutras (from 687 to 690) discuss how many attractions, or specific efforts, are used by living beings in general, from hell to the celestial realms, to acquire the six types of lifespan karma particles, namely caste, name, lifespan, etc., for the purpose of binding? For example, just as many cows drink enough water in one gulp, while others, due to fear, drink water intermittently over two, three, four, or seven to eight hours, similarly, many living beings acquire the karma particles of caste, name, etc., with lifespan, in one slow attraction due to three adhyavasayas, others in two or three slower attractions, or four or five slowest attractions, or six, seven, or eight extremely slowest attractions / It should be noted here that the rule of attraction applies primarily to the caste, name, etc., that bind; it does not apply to the rest of the time. Many natures are 'dhruvabandhini' and many are 'paravartaman' / Since they are capable of binding for a long time, they do not follow the rule of attraction. The order of living beings who attract - The living beings who acquire lifespan karma particles for the purpose of binding in the maximum number of attractions are the fewest, and those who attract in progressively fewer attractions are progressively more numerous, with the most living beings attracting in one attraction.  //  Prajnapana Sutra: Sixth Vyutkranti Pada ends / 2.

The seventh 'Uchchvasapad' of the primary * Prajnapana Sutra discusses the time of cessation of breathing for all worldly beings except the Siddhas. Every creature needs to breathe to sustain life. Whether it be a Muni, a Chakravarti, a king, or any kind of god, a Naraka, or a creature of any species from Ekaindriya to Tiryanchpanchendriya, breathing is essential. Therefore, the breath, known as 'Pran', is of utmost importance and is particularly related to the 'Jivatattva'. For this reason, the scholar has composed this chapter, outlining the time of cessation of breathing for every type of being. Each sutra in this chapter contains the four verbs 'Pranamanti va Panamanti va Usasanati va Nisasanati va'. The commentator, Acharya Malayagiri, considers 'Pranamanti' and 'Usasanati' as synonymous, as well as 'Panamanti' and 'Nosasanati', but he also presents the opinions of other Acharyas. According to them, the first two verbs refer to the external breathing process. * This chapter first discusses the cessation of breathing for the Nairyikas, followed by the ten Bhavanpati Devas, the five Ekaindriyas like Prithvikaayika, the Dwi-Tri-Chaturindriyas, the Panchendriya Tiryanchas, and humans. Finally, it separately outlines the cessation of breathing for the Vanavyantas, Jyotishkas, Soudharmadi Vaimanikas, the nine Graiveyakas, and the five Anuttaravimanas. * This outline of the cessation of breathing for all worldly beings reveals a clear point, which the commentator has highlighted. It is that the more suffering a being experiences, the faster and more frequent their breathing becomes. For beings experiencing extreme suffering, this process continues incessantly. The more happy a being is, the slower their breathing becomes. In other words, their time of cessation of breathing is longer; because breathing itself is a form of suffering, as is evident from personal experience and scriptural texts. 1.

[Seventh Breath Chapter] [503 [724 Pr.]] O Bhagavan! For how long do the gods of the Sarvarthasiddhi Vimana take (internal) inhalation and (external) exhalation? [724 U] Gautama! (They) take (internal) inhalation and (external) exhalation in thirty-three paksas, without any distinction between the inferior and superior. 

The discussion of the inhalation and exhalation of the Nairyakas to the Vaimanikas, in the total thirty-two sutras (Su. 693 to 724) of this chapter, has presented the internal and external inhalation and exhalation of the twenty-four Dandakavarti worldly beings, from the Nairyakas to the Vaimanika gods, with the difference in time between the inferior and superior. 

The meaning of the question: Those beings who are born in the Naraka (hell) etc. realms and are sufficient in terms of inhalation and exhalation, after how much time do they inhale and exhale? That is, after taking one breath, how much time is there between taking the next breath? This is the meaning of each question in this chapter. 

Explanation of the words Pranamanti, Panamanti, Usasanati, Nisasanati: The word 'Aananti' is formed by adding the prefix 'Paang' to the root 'An Pranane' and the word 'Prananti' is formed by adding the prefix 'Pr'. Generally, 'Mananti' and 'Uchchvasanti' and 'Prananti' and 'Nishvasanti' have the same meaning. Then why are two synonymous verbs used here? Such a doubt arises. 

Two solutions are presented here: One is that Bhagavan's disciple, Shri Gautama Swami, has used two synonymous words to clearly present his question, such as "How long do the Nairyakas take a breath, or should we say, take a high breath and a low breath?" In response to such a question from Bhagavan, the same two synonymous words have been used to show respect for the repetition of his disciple's words, because disciples are pleased when their words are respected by their teachers, they are eager to hear the decisive answer to their questions again and again, and the words of such disciples are also considered respectable in the world. 

The second solution is that 'Prananti' and 'Prananti' should be understood as the inhalation and exhalation that occur internally, and 'Uchchvasanti' and 'Nishvasanti' should be understood as the inhalation and exhalation that occur externally. Therefore, here there is no repetition, but the use of separate verbs due to the difference in meaning. 

The secret of continuous inhalation and exhalation for the Narakas: In response to the question about the inhalation of the Nairyakas, Bhagavan said that the Nairyakas continuously inhale and exhale without interruption, so their breathing is constantly active, there is no interruption (separation) between taking one breath and taking the next. 

The meaning of taking inhalation and exhalation by Vimaatra: All the one-sense beings, such as the Earth-bodied, and the two-sense, three-sense, four-sense, five-sense Tiryanch, and humans, take inhalation and exhalation by Vimaatra. This means that there is no fixed time for the separation of their inhalation.

504 [**Prajñāpanā Sūtra** Those who are healthy and happy or yogis who practice **prāṇāyāma** breathe for a long time, but the unhealthy and unhappy or those who indulge in pleasures breathe quickly. / In the realm of gods, the secret of long intervals between inhalation and exhalation is that the longer the lifespan of a god, the happier they are, and the longer their lifespan, the longer the interval between their inhalation and exhalation. This is because the act of breathing is a form of suffering. Therefore, as the lifespan of gods increases like an ocean, the intervals between their breaths also increase. / / **Prajñāpanā Sūtra**: Seventh **Ucchvāsa** section ends / / **Sūkhī** 1. **Prajñāpanā Sūtra** M.

This is the eighth chapter of the *Prajñāpanā Sūtra*, titled 'Saṁjñāpada'. *Saṁjñā* is a technical term. The clear, classical definition of *saṁjñā* is: the mental attitude of desire for obtaining various things like food, etc., arising from the fruition of *vedanīya* and *mohanīya* karmas and the cessation of *jñānāvaraṇīya* and *darśanāvaraṇīya* karmas.  *Saṁjñā* has two meanings according to lexicography: (1) cognition (desire, interest, *vatti* or *pravṛtti*) or enjoyment (inclination or tendency, desire to receive) and (2) that by which or through which this being is known correctly.  *Modern psychology, educational psychology, child psychology, sex psychology, etc., provide detailed descriptions of the basic mental attitudes of beings. These *saṁjñās* are similar to these, indicating the inner mental attitude and external tendency of the being, which allows for a thorough study of the being's life. By these *saṁjñās*, one can understand the tendencies and inclinations of a human or any being and bring about improvement or change in their life.  *From this perspective, *saṁjñās* are very important in life, in examining one's own tendencies and making corrections and additions to them accordingly, and in introspection.  *This chapter first mentions the names of the ten *saṁjñās* beginning with *āhāra*, and then generally describes the presence of these ten *saṁjñās* in all beings, from stars to celestial beings, in varying degrees. These *saṁjñās* are present in a latent form in one-sensed beings and become increasingly apparent in beings with the development of senses.  *Then, considering the four types of beings, the chapter examines the four main *saṁjñās* beginning with *āhāra*, to see which *saṁjñā* is most prevalent in which type of being. It is clearly stated that the *bhaya saṁjñā* is prevalent in *nairāyikas*, the *āhāra saṁjñā* in *tiryancas*, the *maithuna saṁjñā* in humans, and the *parigraha saṁjñā* in gods. Generally, these four *saṁjñās* are present in all four types of beings in varying degrees.  *Then, the chapter considers the relative abundance or scarcity of these four *saṁjñās* in each type of being.

9. *Logasanjna* (Cognition of the world)
10. *Hoghasanjna* (Cognition of the flow of karma)

**Explanation:** 

The ten types of *sanjna* are explained in this sutra (725). 

*Sanjna* can be understood in two ways: 

1. **Cognition:** The experience of perception.
2. **Object of cognition:** The thing that is perceived.

However, the scholarly definition of *sanjna* is: 

The action (in the form of desire, attraction, or mental state) that arises from the activation of *vedaniya* and *mohaniya* karma, and the cessation of *jnanavaraniya* and *darshanavaraniya* karma, leading to the acquisition of various things like food. 

This *sanjna* is divided into ten types based on its characteristics. 

**Scholarly definitions of the ten types of *sanjna*:**

1. **Aharasanjna:** The action of desiring and acquiring food like grains, due to the activation of *kshudhavedaniya* karma.
2. **Bhayasanjna:** The action of experiencing fear, manifested as changes in the eyes, mouth, body, such as trembling, fear, etc., due to the activation of *bhayamohaniya* karma.
3. **Mehunasanjna:** The action of desiring a woman, due to the activation of *purushaved* (a type of *mohaniya* karma), or desiring a man, due to the activation of *strived*, or desiring both, due to the activation of *napunsakaved*.
4. **Pariggrahasanjna:** The action of desiring and acquiring material things, both animate and inanimate, due to the activation of *lobhamohaniya* karma.
5. **Kohasanjna:** The action of experiencing anger, manifested as changes in the face, body, such as red eyes, trembling lips, etc., due to the activation of *krodhamohaniya* karma.
6. **Manasanjna:** The action of experiencing pride, arrogance, and ego, due to the activation of *manamohaniya* karma.
7. **Mayasanjna:** The action of engaging in deceitful behavior, such as lying, due to the activation of *mayamohaniya* karma.
8. **Lomasanjna:** The action of desiring material things, both animate and inanimate, due to the activation of *lobhamohaniya* karma.

508]] [ Prajñāpanasūtra: (8) Lokasaṁjñā - In the realm of the world, there is a strong tendency or desire to follow the popular opinion, even though it is rooted in superstition, violence, falsehood, etc., and is therefore contemptible. Alternatively, it is the intense desire to know the beautiful, pleasing objects of the world (or objects corresponding to the popular words) due to the cessation of the obscurations of knowledge. (10) Proghasaṁjñā - The tendency or inclination to perform an action without any purpose (without thinking), or a whim / for example, climbing a tree without any use or purpose, or moving one's feet while sitting, picking up straws, etc. / Alternatively, it is the desire to know the beautiful, pleasing objects of the world (or objects corresponding to the popular words) in a general way due to the cessation of the obscurations of knowledge of the karma. / These ten types of saṁjñās include both the meanings derived from the above etymology. / Of the above ten saṁjñās, the being is identified by the saṁjñā that is most prevalent in him. / For example, the Naryikas are known by the predominance of the Bhayasaṁjñā. / Alternatively, the being is considered to have the saṁjñā that corresponds to his desire, mental attitude, or tendency.

Ashtama Sanjnapana

[729] Similarly, one should understand the Sanjnas (perceptions/cognitions) found in the Prithvikayikas (earth-bodied beings) up to the Vaimanika (celestial) beings.

The exposition of the Sanjnas found in the Nairayikas (hell-beings) up to the Vaimanikas is presented in four sutras. In all the ten Sanjnas found in the beings from the Nairayikas to the Vaimanikas, the general form is that all the twenty-four Dandakavritti (worldly) beings possess these ten Sanjnas. In the Ekendriyas (one-sensed beings), these Sanjnas exist in an unmanifest form, while in the Pancendriyas (five-sensed beings), they are clearly known. Here, these Sanjnas are mostly described in relation to the Pancendriyas.

Consideration of Sanjnas in Narakas (hells)

[730 Q.] Bhagavan! Are the Nairayikas (hell-beings) endowed with the Aharasanjnopayukta (food-perception), Bhasanjnopayukta (fear-perception), Maithunasanjnopayukta (sexual-perception), or Parigrahasanjnopayukta (possession-perception)?

[730 A.] Gautama! Due to the prevalence of the external cause, they are Bhasanjnopayukta (endowed with fear-perception), but due to the continuity of existence, they are also Aharasanjnopayukta and up to Parigrahasanjnopayukta.

[731 Q.] Bhagavan! Among these Nairayikas who are Aharasanjnopayukta, Bhasanjnopayukta, Maithunasanjnopayukta, and Parigrahasanjnopayukta, which ones are fewer, more, equal, or specially superior?

[731 A.] Gautama! The Maithunasanjnopayukta Nairayikas are the fewest, the Aharasanjnopayukta are countless times more, the Parigrahasanjnopayukta are countless times more than them, and the Bhasanjnopayukta are countless times more than even them.

##  Explanation of 'Prosannakarana' and 'Santtibhava' in the Prajnapana Sutra:

**'Prosanna'** (here, 'Utsana') means 'abundance, i.e., mostly, the majority'. **'Karana'** means external cause. Similarly, **'Santtibhava'** (Santatibhava) means continuous, flowing, internal experience-like feeling.

**In the case of Nairyikas (hell-beings):**

The reason for the abundance of fear-consciousness in Nairyikas is the intense fear they experience from weapons like spears, swords, and arrows, created by the Asuras (demigods) who rule over hell. This fear is constantly present.

Therefore, it is stated here that Nairyikas are mostly (abundantly) characterized by fear-consciousness due to external causes. However, considering the continuous internal experience-like cause, all four types of consciousness (food, possession, sex, and fear) are found in Nairyikas.

**Regarding the abundance of the four types of consciousness in Nairyikas:**

- **Least abundant:** The least number of Nairyikas are characterized by sex-consciousness. This is because their bodies are constantly burning in the fire of suffering, day and night. They do not experience even a moment of happiness.  Those who are constantly being cooked in the fire of suffering throughout the day and night do not have any desire for sex! Even if some do experience sex-consciousness, it lasts for a very short time. Therefore, the least number of Nairyikas are characterized by sex-consciousness.

- **More abundant than sex-consciousness:** The number of Nairyikas characterized by food-consciousness is significantly higher than those characterized by sex-consciousness. This is because these suffering Nairyikas experience food-consciousness for a longer period of time.

- **More abundant than food-consciousness:** The number of Nairyikas characterized by possession-consciousness is significantly higher than those characterized by food-consciousness. This is because Nairyikas experience food-consciousness only for the sustenance of their bodies, while possession-consciousness extends beyond the body, encompassing weapons and other things for survival. This consciousness is more enduring.

- **Most abundant:** The number of Nairyikas characterized by fear-consciousness is significantly higher than those characterized by possession-consciousness. This is because Nairyikas in hell experience a constant fear until their death. Therefore, Nairyikas characterized by fear-consciousness are more numerous than those characterized by the other three types of consciousness. Even at the time of questioning (Pricchha), Nairyikas are found to be overwhelmingly characterized by fear-consciousness.

**Regarding the consciousness of Tiryanchas (animals):**

**732. Tiryancha-yoniya nam bhanta! Ki praharasanno-vutta java pariggahasanno-vutta? Goyama! Prosanna karana paducc praharasanno-vutta, santtibhava paducc praharasanno-vutta vi java pariggahasanno-vutta vi.**

**[732 Pr.]**  O Bhagavan! Are Tiryancha-yoni (animal-born) beings characterized by food-consciousness or possession-consciousness?

**[732 U.]**  Gautama! They are characterized by food-consciousness due to the abundance of external causes. However, considering the continuous internal experience-like feeling, they are characterized by food-consciousness, fear-consciousness, and even possession-consciousness.

[Eighth Knowledge-Section] [511 733. "O Lord! Among the Tiryancha, which are more numerous, those who are characterized by the knowledge of food, or those who are characterized by the knowledge of possession, or those who are characterized by the knowledge of mating, or those who are characterized by the knowledge of fear? 733. "Gautama! Among the Tiryancha, those who are characterized by the knowledge of possession are the least numerous, those who are characterized by the knowledge of mating are many times more numerous than them, those who are characterized by the knowledge of fear are many times more numerous than them, and those who are characterized by the knowledge of food are many times more numerous than them." _ Discussion - The knowledge found in the Tiryancha and the consideration of their relative abundance - The first sutra (Sutra 732-733) describes the knowledge found in the Tiryancha in abundance and with internal experiential continuity, and the second sutra considers the relative abundance of the Tiryancha who are characterized by those respective knowledges. From the perspective of knowledge, the Tiryancha who are characterized by the knowledge of possession are the least numerous, because the knowledge of the one-sensed beings is very subtle, and even in the other Tiryancha, the knowledge of possession is short-lived, therefore they are found in small numbers at the time of questioning. Those who are characterized by the knowledge of mating are said to be many times more numerous than those who are characterized by the knowledge of possession because the use of the knowledge of mating persists for a longer period of time. Those who are characterized by the knowledge of fear are many times more numerous than them because they are constantly afraid of their own kind (Tiryancha) and of other species (non-Tiryancha beings), and the use of fear persists for a longer period of time. Those who are characterized by the knowledge of food are also many times more numerous than them because all Tiryancha generally have a constant (all the time) harmony with the knowledge of food. ' Consideration of knowledge in humans 734. "O Lord! Are humans characterized by the knowledge of food, or are they characterized by the knowledge of possession? 734. "Gautama! They are characterized by the knowledge of mating more often (generally) due to external causes, but they are also characterized by the knowledge of food, and even by the knowledge of possession, due to the internal experiential continuity of the feeling." _ ... - 1.

[513 Eighth Declaration - Gotama!  All the gods who are food-conscious, fear-conscious, sexual-conscious, and possession-conscious, are they few, many, equal, or special in number?  //  [737 Q.]  Bhagavan!  Among these gods who are food-conscious, fear-conscious, sexual-conscious, and possession-conscious, which ones are fewer, more, equal, or special?  [737 A.]  Gotama!  The fewest are the food-conscious gods, (compared to them) the fear-conscious gods are many times more, (compared to them) the sexual-conscious gods are many times more, and compared to them, the possession-conscious gods are many times more.  Discussion - The two sutras (Sutras 736-737) present the idea of the abundance of possession-consciousness among gods and the idea of the four types of consciousness in relation to internal experience.  They also discuss the relative scarcity of the four types of consciousness compared to each other.  Why is possession-consciousness the most prevalent among gods? - Because gods are mostly possession-conscious.  They are always attached to gold, gems, and jewels, which are the causes of possession-consciousness.  The scarcity of the four types of consciousness among gods - The fewest are the food-conscious gods, because the time when gods are deprived of food is very long, and the time when they use food-consciousness is very short.  Therefore, they are few in number when asked about them.  The fear-conscious gods are many times more than the food-conscious gods, because fear-consciousness remains with many gods for a long time.  The sexual-conscious gods are many times more than the fear-conscious gods, and the possession-conscious gods are many times more than them, as explained earlier.  //  //  //  Declaration Sutra:  Eighth Declaration ends.  //  1.

The ninth *Prajnapana Sutra* is called the ninth 'Yoni-pad'. When the lifespan of a being in a particular existence is complete, it carries its *taijas* and *karman* bodies with it. The place where it goes to receive the *pudgalas* of a new body, suitable for rebirth, or is born in the form of a womb, or takes birth, is called 'Yoni'. Yoni has great significance in the life of every being, because the environment, nature, *sanskaras*, traditional tendencies, etc. of the Yoni in which a being is born, have an impact on that being. Therefore, in this *pad*, Shri Shyamacharya has mentioned the various types of Yoni and presented the thoughts of beings in relation to those Yonis. This *pad* describes Yoni from many perspectives. First, it classifies Yoni into three types: cold, hot, and temperate, and then describes which Yoni belongs to which being, from the *nairyaikas* to the *vaimanikas*. Then, it analyzes which of these three Yoni-bearing and *ayonic* beings are more or less numerous. After that, it mentions the three types of Yoni: *sachitta*, *achitta*, and *misra*, and discusses them in the same way. Then, it again considers the three types of Yoni: *sanvrita*, *vivrita*, and *sanvrita-vivrita*, in the same way as before. Finally, it mentions the three specific Yonis of humans: *kurno-nnata*, etc., and describes the women who are their rulers and the humans who are born in them. Overall, this *pad* presents beautiful thoughts about the Yonis of all beings. *The 84 lakh Yonis of beings are all derived from these 9 types of Yonis of all beings.* These 84 lakh Yonis have sprung up as branches and sub-branches of these. *The three specific Yonis that indicate the place of origin of all humans are mentioned at the end: *kurno-nnata*, *shankha-varta*, and *vanshi-patra*. The *tirthankaras* and other great men are born in the *kurno-nnata* Yoni, many beings come and stay in the *shankha-varta* Yoni of women, in the form of a womb,

## Ninth Yoni-pada [519 Yoni and its types - Explanation]

The word 'Yoni' is derived from the root 'yu mishrane', which means 'that in which there is a mixture'. Its classical definition is: A being with a tejas and karman body, in which the community of pudgalaskandha suitable for the bodies of audarik etc. are mixed, that is Yoni. Here, Yoni refers to the place of origin of living beings.

**Cold Yoni:** A Yoni that is the result of cold touch.

**Hot Yoni:** A Yoni that is the result of hot touch.

**Cold-Hot Yoni:** A Yoni that is the result of both cold and hot touch.

**The Yoni of the Seven Narakas:** Generally, there are only two Yonis for the Nairyikas - cold Yoni and hot Yoni. The third, cold-hot Yoni, does not exist for them.

**Which Yoni is in which Naraka-earth?** The commentators explain: The areas of origin (upapat) of the Narakas in Ratnaprabha, Sharkaraprabha and Balukaprabha are all transformed by cold touch. Except for these areas of origin, the rest of the places in these three earths are transformed by hot touch. Therefore, the Nairyikas with cold Yoni here experience hot sensations.

In Pankaprabha earth, most of the areas of origin are transformed by cold touch, while a few areas are transformed by hot touch. In the Prastatas (rocks) and Narakavasa where there are areas of origin with cold touch, the rest of the places are hot touch, and in the Prastatas and Narakavasa where there are areas of origin with hot touch, the rest of the places are cold touch. Therefore, many cold Yoni Nairyikas experience hot sensations, while a few hot Yoni Nairyikas experience cold sensations.

In Dhumraprabha earth, many areas of origin are transformed by hot touch, while a few areas are transformed by cold touch. In the Prastatas and Narakavasa where there are areas of origin with hot touch, the rest of the places are cold touch, and in the Prastatas and Narakavasa where there are areas of origin with cold touch, the rest of the places are hot touch. Therefore, many hot Yoni Nairyikas experience cold sensations, while a few cold Yoni Nairyikas experience hot sensations.

In Tamahprabha and Tamatamahprabha earth, all areas of origin are transformed by hot touch. The rest of the places there are cold touch. Therefore, the hot Yoni Narakas there experience cold sensations.

**Why are the Yonis of Bhavanavasi Devas etc. cold-hot?** The areas of origin of all types of Bhavanavasi Devas, Garbhaja Tiryanch Panchendriya, Garbhaja Manushya, and Vyantar, Jyotishka and Vaimanika Devas are transformed by both cold and hot touch, therefore their Yonis are of both cold and hot nature (cold-hot).

Except for the Tejaskaayikas, the Yonis of the Prithvikaayikas etc. are all hot Yoni. This is directly proven. Except for them, the areas of origin of all other Ekendriya, Vikalendriya, Sammachhim Tiryanch Panchendriya and Sammachhim Manushyas are cold touch, hot touch and cold-hot touch, therefore their Yonis are said to be of all three types.

## Translation:

**[520]**  According to the *Prajñāpanā* (Scripture), there are very few beings with the three types of *yonis* (wombs) and *prayonikas* (sub-wombs). The least number of beings are those with the *śītoṣṇa* (temperate) *yoni*, because only the *bhavanapati* (heavenly) gods, the *garbhaja* (born from womb) *tiryañc* (animals) with five senses, the *garbhaja* (born from womb) humans, the *vyantar* (intermediate) beings, the *jyotiṣka* (luminous) gods, and the *vaimānika* (aerial) gods have the *śītoṣṇa* *yoni*. There are countless times more beings with the *uṣṇa* (hot) *yoni*, because all the *sūkṣma-bād* (subtle-bodied) *tejaskaayika* (fire-bodied) beings, most of the *nairāyika* (hellish) beings, some of the *pṛthvīkāyika* (earth-bodied) beings, the *apkāyika* (water-bodied) beings, the *vāyūkāyika* (air-bodied) beings, and all the *vanaspatikāyika* (plant-bodied) beings have the *uṣṇa* *yoni*. Compared to them, there are infinitely more *ayonika* (without *yoni* - *siddha*) beings, because the *siddha* (liberated) beings are infinite. Compared to these, there are infinitely more beings with the *śīta* (cold) *yoni*, because all the *anantakāyika* (infinite-bodied) beings have the *śīta* *yoni*, and they are infinitely more than the *siddhas*.

**[754]**  **Question:**  O Venerable One! How many types of *yonis* are there?
**Answer:**  Gautama! There are three types of *yonis*. They are: (1) *saccitta* *yoni* (conscious *yoni*), (2) *acitta* *yoni* (unconscious *yoni*), and (3) *miśra* *yoni* (mixed *yoni*).

**[755]**  **Question:**  O Venerable One! Do the *narayika* (hellish) beings have a *saccitta* *yoni*, an *acitta* *yoni*, or a *miśra* *yoni*?
**Answer:**  Gautama! The *narayika* beings do not have a *saccitta* *yoni*, they have an *acitta* *yoni*, but not a *miśra* *yoni*.

**[756]**  **Question:**  O Venerable One! Do the *asurakumāra* (demon-children) beings have a *saccitta* *yoni*, an *acitta* *yoni*, or a *miśra* *yoni*?
**Answer:**  Gautama! They do not have a *saccitta* *yoni*, they have an *acitta* *yoni*, but not a *miśra* *yoni*.

**[757]**  Similarly, one should understand the *yoni* of the *sthānitakumāra* (thunder-children) beings.

**[758]**  **Question:**  O Venerable One! Do the *pṛthvīkāyika* (earth-bodied) beings have a *saccitta* *yoni*, an *acitta* *yoni*, or a *miśra* *yoni*?
**Answer:**  Gautama! They have a *saccitta* *yoni*, an *acitta* *yoni*, and a *miśra* *yoni*.

Ninth Yooni-Pata [521 [758 Q. Bhagavan! What is the nature of the yooni of earth-bodied beings, is it Sachitt, Achitt or Misra-yooni? [758 A. Gautama! Their yooni is both Sachitt, Achitt and Misra-yooni. 756. And so on for birds. [756] In the same way, one should understand (the yooni of) all the four-sense beings. 760. For the Sammuchhim Pancha-indriya Tiryanch-yoonis and the Sammuchhim humans, it should be understood in the same way. 761. The yooni of the Garbha-jat Pancha-indriya Tiryanch-yoonis and the Garbha-jat humans is neither Sachitt nor Achitt, but Misra-yooni. 762. For the Vaan-mantara-jois-vemaan-yoonis, like the Asura-kumara, (the description of yooni) should be understood in the same way. 763. Q. Bhagavan! Of these Sachitt-yooni beings, Achitt-yooni beings, Misra-yooni beings and A-yooni beings, which are less, many, equal or more special? [763 A. Gautama! Misra-yooni beings are the fewest, (from them) Achitt-yooni beings are countless times more, (from them) A-yooni beings are infinite times more, (and from them) Sachitt-yooni beings are infinite times more. // 2 // Discussion - From another perspective, considering all beings in relation to the different types of yoonis like Sachitt etc. - In these ten sutras (from 754 to 763), the three types of yoonis, Sachitt etc., are explained from different perspectives, and the order of the twenty-four Dandakavarti beings is discussed, which beings have which yoonis, and which yooni beings are less, many or more special.

522) [Prajñāpanāsūtra _ The meaning of Saccittadi Yonis: Saccitta Yoni - the Yoni that is associated with the Jiva (Prātmā) regions. Pracitta Yoni - the Yoni that is devoid of Jiva. Miśra Yoni - the Yoni that is both free and not free from Jiva, i.e., which is both Saccitta and Acitta. What kind of Yoni do the Jivas have and why? - The Upapata Kṣetra of the Narakas are not possessed by any Jiva, therefore they are not Saccitta (living), hence their Yoni is Acitta. / Although the Sūkṣma Ekendriya Jivas are present in all Lokas (Lokākāśa), however, the regions of those Jivas are not interconnected with the Pudgala of those Upayata Kṣetra, i.e., those Upayata Kṣetra are not the body form of those Sūkṣma Ekendriya Jivas, therefore the Yoni of the Nairāyikas is said to be Acitta. Similarly, the Yonis of the Aśurakumāra etc. Daśavidha Bhavanapati Devas, Vyantaras, Jyotiṣkas and Vaimānika Devas should also be understood as Acitta. From the Pṛthvīkāyikas to the Sammūcchima Manusya, all their Upapata Kṣetra are possessed by Jivas, not possessed, and both, therefore their Yoni is of all three types. Where the Garbhaja Tiryacpancendriya and Garbhaja Manusya are born, there are also Acitta Śukra-Śonita etc. Pudgala, therefore they are of Miśra Yoni. Compared to Saccittadi Yonis, the Jivas of Miśrayoni are said to be the least because only Garbhaja Tiryacpancendriya and Garbhaja Manusya are Miśrayoni. / The Acitta Yoni Jivas are countless times more than them, because all Devas, Narakas and some Pṛthvīkāyika, Apkāyika, Tejas Kāyika, Vāyu Kāyika, each Vanaspatika Kāyika, Dvi-Tri-Caturindriya Jiva, Sammūcchima Tiryac Pancendriya and Sammūcchima Manusya are of Acitta Yoni. Compared to Acitta Yoni, the Ayoni (Siddh) Jivas are infinite, because Siddhas are infinite and compared to Ayoni, the Saccitta Yoni Jivas are infinitely more, because the Jivas of Nigoda are Saccitta Yoni and they are infinitely more than the Siddhas. / 'The description of the three types of Yonis, Samvatadi, in all Jivas 764. How many types of Yoni are there, Bhante? Gautama! There are three types of Yoni. / That is - (1) Samvṛta Yoni, Vivṛta Yoni and (3) Samvṛta-Vivṛta Yoni. [764 Pr.] Bhagavan! How many types of Yoni are said to be? [764 U.] Gautama! Yoni is said to be of three types. / It is as follows - (1) Samvṛta Yoni, Vivṛta Yoni and (3) Samvṛta-Vivṛta Yoni. / 765. Neraiyāṇam Bhante! What is Samvṛta Yoni, Vivṛta Yoni, Samvṛta-Vivṛta Yoni? Gautama! Samvṛta Yoni, not Vivṛta Yoni, not Samvṛta-Vivṛta Yoni. 1. Prajñāpanāsūtra Malay. Vṛtti, Patrānka 226-227.

## Ninth Yooni-pada [523 [765 Pr.]]

**O Bhagavan!** What kind of yooni do the Nairyikas have? Is it a closed yooni, an open yooni, or a closed-open yooni?

**[765 U.]** Gautama! The Nairyikas have a closed yooni, but not an open yooni, nor a closed-open yooni.

**766.** Similarly, this should be said about the yooni of the Vanaspatikayika beings.

**[767 Pr.]** O Bhagavan! What kind of yooni do the Dwindriya beings have? Is it a closed yooni, an open yooni, or a closed-open yooni?

**[767 U.]** Gautama! They do not have a closed yooni, but an open yooni, but not a closed-open yooni.

**768.** Similarly, this should be understood about the yooni of the Chaturindriya beings.

**766.** This should also be understood about the yooni of the Sammuchchhim Panchendriya Tiryanch and the Sammuchchhim Manusya.

**770.** The yooni of the Garbhajak Panchendriya Tiryanch and the Garbhajak Manusya is neither closed nor open, but closed-open.

**771.** The yooni of the Vanavyantar, Jyotishk, and Vaimanik Devas should be understood like that of the Nairyikas.

**772.** O Bhagavan! Among these beings, which ones have a closed yooni, an open yooni, a closed-open yooni, and a Prajooni? Are they few, many, equal, or different?

**[U.]** Gautama! All beings have a closed-open yooni, an open yooni, an infinite number of Prajoonis, and an infinite number of closed yoonis.

524] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra [772 Pr.] Bhagavan! Among these closed-womb beings, open-womb beings, closed-open-womb beings, and wombless beings, which are fewer, many, equal, or superior? [772 U.] Gautama! The fewest are closed-open-womb beings, (from them) open-womb beings are countless times (more), (from them) wombless beings are infinite times (more), and (from them) closed-womb beings are infinite times (more) // 3 //

## Ninth Yooni-pada [525 [773-1 Pr.] Bhagavan! How many types of Yooni are there? [773-1 Ut.] Gautama! Yooni is said to be of three types. They are as follows: (1) Kuummoonnata, (2) Shankhaavarta, and (3) Vanshipatra. [2] Kuummunnaya nam jooni uttampurisamaaunaam / Kuummunnayae nam joonie uttampurisa gambe bakkamati / Tam jaha-arhanta chakkavatti baldeva vasudeva / [773-2] Karmmoonnata Yooni is of the mothers of the Uttama Purushas / In Karmmoonnata Yooni, these Uttama Purushas are born in the womb / Like - Arhanta (Tirthankara), Chakravarti, Baldeva and Vasudeva / [3] Sankhaavatta nam jooni itthiriyanass / Sankhaavattae nam joonie bahve jova ya poggala ya vakkamati viukkamati chayanthi uvacayanthi, no cheva nam nippfajati / [773-3] Shankhaavarta Yooni is of the Striratna. In Shankhaavarta Yooni, many Jivas and Pudgalas come, are born in the womb, grow in a general and special way (chay-upchay), but they are not born. [4] Vansopatta gam jooni pihujanass / Vanshipattae nam jonoe pihujane gambe vakkamati / // Panavanae Bhagavaie navam joonipayam sammattam / / 7i73-4] Vanshipatra Yooni is of the Prithak (common) people (mothers). In Vanshipatra Yooni, Prithak (common) Jivas are born in the womb / Discussion: The humans are presented with three types of Yooni in this Sutra (773/1,2,3,4). The humans are described as having three specific Yoonis, Kuummoonnata etc., the women with those Yoonis, and the humans born in them. The meaning of Karmmoonnata etc. Yoonis: Karmmoonnata Yooni = the Yooni which is elevated, high, or raised like the back of a tortoise. Shankhaavarta Yooni - the Yooni whose cycles are like the ups and downs of a conch shell / Vanshipatra Yooni - the Yooni which is shaped like two joined (connected) Vanshipatra. The nature of Shankhaavarta Yooni - Shankhaavarta is of the Striratna, that is, the queen of the Chakravarti. In this Yooni, many Jivas descend (come), are born in the womb, grow in a general way (chit) and grow in a special way (upchit). But they are not born, they are destroyed in the womb / In this regard, the opinion of the old Acharyas is that the Jivas who come in Shankhaavarta Yooni are destroyed there due to the intense heat of the strong Kamagni. 1 Prajnapanasutra: Ninth Yooni-pada is complete / / 1.

##  Anadhyayakala [Quoted from Nandī Sūtra edited by Acharya Shri Atmaramji Maharaj]

One should study the scriptures only during the time prescribed in the Agamas for self-study. Studying during the Anadhyayakala is prohibited. The Manusmriti and other Smritis also describe the Anadhyayakala in detail. Vedic people also mention the Anadhyayas of the Vedas. Similarly, other Ārya scriptures are also considered to have Anadhyayas. Since the Jain Agamas are also considered to be Sarvajñokta, Devadhiṣṭhita, and Svaravidyā, their Anadhyayakala is also mentioned in the Agamas. For example:

**Ten types of Anadhyayas related to the sky:**

1. Ulkāpāta-Tārāpatana: If there is a great fall of stars, one should not study the scriptures for one prahara.
2. Digdāha: As long as the direction is red, meaning it appears as if there is fire in the direction, one should not study.
3. Gajita: When the clouds thunder, one should not study for two praharas.
4. Vidyut: When lightning flashes, one should not study for one prahara. However, the Anadhyayas of thunder and lightning should not be considered during Chaturmas.

**Ten types of Anadhyayas related to the physical body:**

1. Aṭṭhī: Bones
2. Maṃsaṃ: Flesh
3. Soṇite: Blood
4. Asūtisāmante: The end of life
5. Susāṇasāmante: The end of a cemetery
6. Candovārāte: The end of the moon
7. Sūrovārāte: The end of the sun
8. Paḍane: Falling
9. Rāyabuṅghae: The end of a king
10. Uvassayassa Anto: The end of a fast

**Four Mahapratipadās:**

1. Prāsāḍhapratipadā
2. Indamahāpratipadā
3. Kattaprapatipadā
4. Sugimhapratipadā

**Four Sandhyās:**

1. Paḍimāte: Evening
2. Pacchimāte: Sunset
3. Majjhaṇhe: Noon
4. Aḍḍha Ratte: Midnight

According to the above Sūtra text, there are thirty-two Anadhyayas: ten related to the sky, ten related to the physical body, four Mahapratipadās, and four Sandhyās. 

**Summary of Anadhyayas:**

1. **Ulkāpāta-Tārāpatana:** One prahara
2. **Digdāha:** Until the direction appears red
3. **Gajita:** Two praharas
4. **Vidyut:** One prahara (not during Chaturmas)
5. **Aṭṭhī:**  
6. **Maṃsaṃ:**  
7. **Soṇite:**  
8. **Asūtisāmante:**  
9. **Susāṇasāmante:**  
10. **Candovārāte:**  
11. **Sūrovārāte:**  
12. **Paḍane:**  
13. **Rāyabuṅghae:**  
14. **Uvassayassa Anto:**  
15. **Prāsāḍhapratipadā:**  
16. **Indamahāpratipadā:**  
17. **Kattaprapatipadā:**  
18. **Sugimhapratipadā:**  
19. **Paḍimāte:**  
20. **Pacchimāte:**  
21. **Majjhaṇhe:**  
22. **Aḍḍha Ratte:**

## Translation:

**530]** [Thunder and lightning are often due to the nature of the season. Therefore, from Pārdra to Svāti Nakshatra, it is not considered an Adhyāya (period of study). / 5. Nirghāta - When there is a loud thunder in the sky without clouds, or when there is lightning in the sky with clouds, there is an Asvādhāya (period of non-study) for two Praharas (3 hours). 6. Yūpaka - In the Shukla Paksha (bright fortnight), the first, second, and third days, the meeting of the twilight glow and the moonlight is called Yūpaka / On these days, one should not study from Prahara to night. 7. Yakṣādīpta - Sometimes, a light that appears in a direction like lightning, but with a slight delay, is called Yakṣādīpta. Therefore, as long as the Yakṣākāra (Yaksha-like light) is visible in the sky, one should not study. / 8. Dhūmikā-Kṛṣṇa - From Kārttika to Māgha, the time is the womb month of the clouds / In this, a fine water-like mist of smoky color falls. It is called Dhūmikā-Kṛṣṇa / As long as this mist falls, one should not study. / 9. Mihikāśveta - In winter, a fine water-like mist of white color is called Mihikā. As long as it falls, it is an Asvādhāya period. 10. Raja-Udghāta - Due to the wind, dust spreads all around in the sky / As long as this dust remains spread, one should not study / The above ten reasons are related to the sky, and are considered Asvādhāya. The next ten reasons are related to the Audārika (worldly affairs). 11-12-13. Bone, Flesh, and Blood - If the bone, flesh, and blood of a five-sensed animal are visible, then it is an Asvādhāya until these things are removed from there. The commentator considers it an Asvādhāya if these things are present within 60 hands (approximately 30 meters) around. / Similarly, the bone, flesh, and blood of a human being are also considered an Asvādhāya. The difference is that their Asvādhāya lasts for 100 hands (approximately 50 meters) and one day and night. The Asvādhāya of a woman's menstrual period lasts for three days / The Asvādhāya of the birth of a boy and a girl is considered to be seven and eight days respectively. / 14. Praśuci - As long as feces and urine are visible, it is an Asvādhāya. 15. Śmaśāna - A hundred hands (approximately 50 meters) around the cremation ground is considered an Asvādhāya. 16. Chandragrahaṇa - During a lunar eclipse, one should not study for eight Praharas (24 hours) for the lowest, twelve Praharas (36 hours) for the middle, and sixteen Praharas (48 hours) for the highest. 17. Sūryagrahaṇa - During a solar eclipse, it is also considered an Asvādhāya period for eight, twelve, and sixteen Praharas respectively.

## Chapter 1 [531]

18. **Anadhyayakala** (period of non-study) occurs when a great king or national leader dies. One should not perform **svadhyaya** (self-study) until their cremation is completed. Alternatively, one should gradually resume **svadhyaya** until a new authority takes over.

16. **Rajavyudgraha** (war between kingdoms) - When there is a war between neighboring kingdoms, one should not perform **svadhyaya** until peace is restored. Even after peace is established, one should refrain from **svadhyaya** for one day and night.

20. **Audarik** (generous) **sharira-upashraya** (body-shelter) - When a five-sensed being dies within a generous body-shelter, one should not perform **svadhyaya** as long as the body remains. If the lifeless body remains within a 100-hand span, **svadhyaya** should be avoided. These ten reasons for **asvadhyaya** (non-study) are related to the generous body.

21-28. **Four Mahotsava** (great festivals) and **Four Mahapratipada** (great first days) - The four **Mahotsava** are: **Ashadha-Purnima**, **Ashwin-Purnima**, **Katik-Purnima**, and **Chaitra-Purnima**. The **pratipada** (first day) following these **Purnima** (full moon) days are called **Mahapratipada**. **Svadhyaya** is prohibited during these days.

29-32. **Pratah** (morning), **Sayam** (evening), **Madhyahna** (noon), and **Ardharatri** (midnight) - One should not perform **svadhyaya** one **ghadi** (hour) before and after sunrise, one **ghadi** before and after sunset, one **ghadi** before and after noon, and one **ghadi** before and after midnight.

"It is a pleasure to know how much effort has been put in by the editors, writers, reviewers, and authors of the preface. The credit for this grand scheme goes to the coordinator and chief editor, Yuvacharya Shri Madhukar Muni, who unfortunately is no longer with us.  Our heartfelt tributes to him! The printing and presentation of all the Agamas is very attractive and considering the current inflation, their price is negligible.  I once again congratulate the enthusiastic workers of the Agama Prakashan Samiti and the dignitaries of the Hazarimala Smriti Prakashan, especially the hardworking late Yuvacharya Shri Madhukar Muni, the executor of this grand scheme, who took the responsibility of carrying the burden of this important task on his shoulders and implemented the plan for the propagation and dissemination of knowledge, benefiting the masses."

The *Prakashkiya Pannavanā-Prajñāpanā Sūtra* is a specific *āgama* text of Jain philosophy. It is as vast as it is profound. To gain a deep understanding of the principles, the study, contemplation, and reflection of this *āgama* is not only necessary but also mandatory. The *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* is composed in 36 chapters. This present edition includes the original text along with its meaning and explanation in Hindi. Due to this, the size of the text has increased significantly. However, without it, it would not be possible for every reader to understand the essence of the text. In this situation, this *āgama* is being published in three volumes. The first volume has already been published. This second volume is in the hands of the readers. The same method of explanation, etc., that was adopted in the first volume has been adopted in this one. The same method will be followed in the final, i.e., the third volume. The detailed introduction and necessary appendices, etc., will be given only in the third volume. Its translator-editor is the renowned scholar and speaker of the Jain world, Pt. R. Shrigyanmuniji Maharaj. The committee is extremely grateful for the valuable contribution of Munishri. The *Uttarādhyayana Sūtra* is almost ready for printing. The work of printing the *Vyākhyāprajñapti* is also underway. It is hoped that all these *āgamas* will be sent to the service of the readers soon. Honorable Shri Hukmichandji Ma. Chordia has provided special financial assistance in the publication of this book. We are extremely grateful to him. It is a matter of great regret that the architect of this grand plan of *āgama* publication, the most revered young Acharya Shri Mishrimalji Ma. Sa. 'Madhukar', is no longer among us. However, with his indirect blessings and the valuable cooperation of the learned Mahasati Shri Umravkuvarji Ma. 'Archana' and the efforts of Pt. Shri Shobhachandji Bharill, etc., the publication work is continuing and will continue. Finally, we are grateful to all the helpful dignitaries and workers whose combined efforts have ensured the smooth progress of the publication work. Ratanchand Modi / Jatanraj Mehta / Chandmal Vinaykia Acting President Prime Minister Minister *Āgama*-Publication-Committee, Byawar (Rajasthan)

The sole purpose of this publication, with the special financial assistance of Shri Hukmichandji Sa. Chordia [Life-Line] is to make the Jain Agamas, the guides to the path of liberation, accessible for reading and study at the lowest possible price. Therefore, the committee has no regional boundaries or sectarian affiliations. It is the same for all regions, provinces and countries, and for all ganas, gachchas and communities. This is why the committee is receiving support from Jain enthusiasts residing in various parts of India. However, it would be inappropriate not to mention that the contribution of the large Chordia family of Nokha (Chandavats) is extremely important and commendable. The financial support provided by various members of this family in this Herculean task of publication is extraordinary. Earlier, many Agamas were published with the financial assistance of the gentlemen of this family, and this present Agama is also being published with the special financial assistance of a distinguished member and wealthy Seth Hukmichandji Chordia of this family. Shri Hukmichandji Chordia Sa. is the youngest of the four sons of Seth Zoravarmalji Sa. You were a partner in business with your elder brother Shriman Dulhichandji Sa., whose introduction we have already given in the Aupatik Sutra, from 1958 to 1958. After that, you started your own finance business, which is flourishing today due to your intelligence and dedication. Shri Hukmichandji Sa. is young and full of youthful enthusiasm, but the flow of your enthusiasm is not one-sided. Just as you are business-oriented, you are also service-oriented. You are connected in various ways with many educational, literary and social institutions running in your business center Madras and are fulfilling the sacred duty of social service through them. You have received and are receiving support from the following institutions: (1) Jain Bhavan (2) Manav-Rahatkosh (3) Shri M.M. Jain Education Society (4) Muni Shri Hazarimala Smriti Prakashan (5) Jain Seva Samiti, Nokha (6) Shwe. Sta. Jain Mahila Sangh (7) Ahimsa Prachar Sangh (5) Rajasthani Youth Association You are a member of Jain Medical Relief Society, Shri Ganeshibai Galsan High School, Shri Devaraj Manak Chand Hospital etc. many institutions. In addition, you have established the 'Zoravarmal Hukmichandji Chordia Trust' with a broad sense of charity. The 'Hukmichand Chordia Rolling Trophy' is awarded by you. Thus, your life is full of service. We wish you a long and prosperous life.

This is the tenth 'Charampadi' of the Prajnapana Sutra. In the world, there are Jivas and Ajiva. Among Ajiva, there are Ratna Prabha and other Earths, Devaloka, Lok, Alok, and Paramanu-Pudgala, Skandha, Sansthana, etc. Some of these are Charam (final), and some are Acharam (middle). Therefore, how to call something as Ekavachananta Charam or Acharam, or Bahuvachananta Charam or Acharam, or Charamanta Pradesh or Acharamanta Pradesh? This thought is presented in this Padi. The Vattikar has explained the mystery of the words Charam and Acharam, etc., by saying that these words are relative, they depend on others. From this perspective, first, the Charam and Acharam of Ratna Prabha and other eight Earths, Saudharma, etc., Lok, Alok, etc., are discussed with 6 options. In response, these six options are negated because if Ratna Prabha, etc., are considered as one undivided entity, then none of the above options are true. But if its intention is to be considered as an infinite Pradesh Avagaha, and it is divided into many parts, then it is, by rule, Acharam-Aneka Charam, Charamanta Pradesh, and Acharamanta Pradesh. The Vattikar has also revealed the mystery of this answer. After this, the Alp Bahutva of the above-mentioned 6 Padi of Charam, etc., is considered. It is also discussed from the three Nayas of Dravyathik, Pradeshthik, and Dravya Pradeshthik of Ratna Prabha, etc., Earths, Lok-Alok, etc. After this, a detailed discussion is done on the 26 Bhang (options) of Charam, Acharam, and Pravaktavya, which are made by combining Ekavachananta, Bahuvachananta, Asanyogi, Dwikasanyogi, Trikasanyogi, etc., of these three Padi, in relation to Skandha, etc., from one Paramanu Pudgala, Dwi Pradesh to Ananta Pradesh. It is discussed how many Bhang are found in each of these 26 Bhang, and why? After this, the discussion is done on the 5 Sansthana, their Prabheda, their Pradesh, their Avagahana, and their Charam, etc. 1.

The tenth chapter of the last text, the ultimate discourse on the earth and the worlds, 774. How many earths are there, O Lord?  Gautama! There are eight earths. They are as follows: (1) Ratnapraba, (2) Sakkarapraba, (3) Valuyapraba, (4) Pankapraba, (5) Dhumapraba, (6) Tamahpraba, (7) Tamatamapraba, and (8) Isatprabhara. 775. O Lord! Is this Ratnapraba earth the ultimate, the non-ultimate, the ultimate in many forms, the non-ultimate in many forms, the ultimate in many regions, or the non-ultimate in many regions? Gautama! This Ratnapraba earth is neither the ultimate nor the non-ultimate, neither the ultimate in many forms nor the non-ultimate in many forms, neither the ultimate in many regions nor the non-ultimate in many regions, but by rule (it is one earth) both the non-ultimate and the ultimate in many forms, and both the ultimate in many regions and the non-ultimate in many regions. 776. Thus (like the Ratnapraba earth) up to the seventh earth (Tamatamapraba) the same description should be applied.  /  From Saudharma onwards up to the Anuttara Vimana, the same description should be understood. The description of the Isatprabhara earth should also be said in the same way (as the Ratnapraba earth).  /  The same should be said about the worlds and the non-worlds (alokakasha).

The Prajnapana Sutra Commentary-Text presents a statement regarding the ultimate and penultimate of the earths and the loka-lokas in three sutras. In the first sutra, the text of Ratnaprabaha, etc., mentions the names of the earths. In the second sutra, a description is given regarding the ultimate and penultimate, etc., of the Ratnaprabaha earth. And in the third sutra, an exaggeration is given related to the statement of the ultimate and penultimate, etc., of the remaining earths, the deva-loka from Saudharma to Anuttara Vimana, and the loka-lokas. The classical definition of ultimate and penultimate - well, the meaning of ultimate is final and the meaning of penultimate is that which is not final, that which is in the middle. But here, the consideration of ultimate, penultimate, etc., is done in relation to the various sections of the entire loka, Ratnaprabaha, etc., and the aloka. Therefore, ultimate, etc., are technical terms here, and the commentator has interpreted them from this perspective. The meaning of ultimate is paryantavarti, i.e., situated at the end. The word ultimate is relative here, i.e., it depends on something else. If something else is before it, then only can another be called 'ultimate'. For example, in relation to the previous bodies, the ultimate (final) body (the final bhava in relation to the previous bhavas is called the ultimate bhava) is called. That which has nothing before it cannot be called ultimate. Similarly, the meaning of the word penultimate is that which is not ultimate - final, i.e., that which is in the middle. This term is also relative, because when something is at the end, then only can the one in the middle be called 'penultimate' in relation to it. That which has nothing before or after it cannot be called 'penultimate', i.e., in the middle (situated in the middle). For example, in relation to the ultimate body and all other bodies, the body in the middle is called the penultimate body. Just as two questions have been asked here on the basis of the singular, in the same way, two questions have been asked regarding the plural. 'Charimāiṁ Acharimāiṁ' are both plural forms of ultimate and penultimate. Their meaning is - many ultimate forms and many penultimate forms. These four questions have been asked considering the Ratnaprabaha, etc., earths as one substance with a unique one-ness result. After this, two questions have been asked targeting its regions - 'Charimantapadeśa', 'Pracharimantapadeśa' (Charamantapradeśa Acharamantapradeśa). The meaning is - those with ultimate end regions and those with penultimate end regions. Its meaning is - is the Ratnaprabaha earth ultimate multi-region form, or penultimate multi-region form? Its clear meaning is - are the end regions the Ratnaprabaha earth, or are the middle regions the Ratnaprabaha earth? The words ultimate and penultimate are both relative. Neither can a region alone be ultimate, nor penultimate. The answer to the aforementioned six questions - the answer to the aforementioned questions of Gautam Swami is given by the Lord first in a negative form - this Ratnaprabaha earth is not ultimate, because it is one and indivisible in relation to substance. It cannot be called ultimate (ultimateness is relative, if there is something before the Ratnaprabaha earth, then in relation to it, it can be called ultimate. But there is no such other, because the Ratnaprabaha earth is one, indivisible, and absolute, about which you (Gautam Swami) have asked the question. Similarly, according to the aforementioned reasoning, the Ratnaprabaha earth cannot be called penultimate either, because penultimateness, i.e., intermediateness, also depends on something else, therefore it is relative. There is no such other here, in relation to which the Ratnaprabaha earth can be called penultimate. After this, the plural questions asked - 1. Prajnapana Sutra Malaya. Commentary, Page No. 229

Page #595:
---------------------------
The Lord answers the questions in a negative way - the Ratnapraba earth is neither a single ultimate nor a multiple ultimate. Because, as per the previous statement, when the Ratnapraba earth is not a single ultimate and non-ultimate, how can it be a multiple ultimate and non-ultimate? That is, the Ratnapraba earth is neither a multiple ultimate substance nor a multiple non-ultimate substance. Similarly, the Ratnapraba earth cannot be described as either ultimate-ending regions or non-ultimate-ending regions. Because, when ultimateness and non-ultimateness are not possible in the Ratnapraba earth, then it cannot be called an ultimate region or a non-ultimate region. The question arises that if the Ratnapraba earth is not any of the aforementioned six options, then what is it? How should it be described and understood? The Lord said in response - 'The Ratnapraba earth is non-ultimate and multiple ultimate (charamani) and is ultimate-ending region and non-ultimate-ending region. This means that when the question is asked about the Ratnapraba earth, which is intended in a single and undivided form, it cannot fall into any of the aforementioned six categories, but when the Ratnapraba earth is considered as countless regions and divided into many components, then it can be called non-ultimate and multiple ultimate (charamani). Because the Ratnapraba earth is situated in such a form. In such a situation, each section existing in its boundary parts and the one-result of various types are transformed, those sections can be called multiple ultimate (charamani) and the large section that is in the middle of those boundary parts, if it is considered as one due to being a one-result of various types, then it is 'non-ultimate'. Thus, the Ratnapraba earth is a collective form consisting of many boundary sections and a single central large section, not accepting this will lead to the absence of the Ratnapraba earth. In this way, when the same earth is considered as component-composed, it can be called non-ultimate-multiple ultimate (charamani), that is, undivided and a single subject of definition, similarly, when the regions are intended, it can also be called 'ultimate-ending multiple region' and 'non-ultimate-ending multiple region', because the regions present in its external sections are called ultimate-ending regions and the regions present in the central large section are called 'non-ultimate-ending regions'. Thus, the Lord's answer, which mainly negates the one-sided error, indicates that the Ratnapraba and other objects are component-composed, there is some difference and some non-difference between the component and the composed, this is indicated by the Anekanta principle. Just as the Ratnapraba earth was analyzed and modeled by questioning and defining (with logic), the same modeling should be done from the Sharkara earth to the Tamas earth, and from Saudharma to Anuttara Vimana, and also for the Ishtapraarabhara earth and the Lok. The same should be done for the Alok by creating a question-answer formula. For Alok, the sections that enter the Lok's non-ultimate are ultimate, the rest are all non-ultimate, and the regions in the ultimate section are ultimate-ending regions and the regions in the non-ultimate section are non-ultimate-ending regions. 1.

The **Acharamanta Pradesh** of the **Lok** are **asankhyāta** times greater than the **Acharamanta Pradesh** of the **Alok**. The **Acharamanta Pradesh** of the **Alok** are **ananta** times greater than the **Acharamanta Pradesh** of the **Lok**. The **Charamanta Pradesh** and **Acharamanta Pradesh** of both **Lok** and **Alok** are **viśeṣādhika**. Compared to the **Charamanta Pradesh** and **Acharamanta Pradesh** of **Lok** and **Alok**, all **dravya** are **viśeṣādhika**. Compared to them, all **pradeśa** are **ananta** times greater, and compared to them, all **paryāya** are **ananta** times greater.

The **vivecana** of the terms **charam**, **acharam**, etc., and their **alpabahutva** is presented in four **sūtra** (from **sū. 777** to **780**). The **ratnaprabhādi** text discusses the **alpabahutva** of the **charam**, **acharam**, etc., four divisions of **lok**, **alok**, and **lokālok** from the **saudharma** earth to the **anuttar vimāna** in the **devaloka**. It also discusses the **alpabahutva** of **dravya**, **pradeśa**, and **dravya-pradeśa**.

According to the **ratnaprabhā**, the **acharam** of the **ratnaprabhā-pṛthvī** is the smallest compared to the **dravya**. This is because the **acharam-khaṇḍa** is one due to its **ekaskandha-rūpa** (oneness) and **parināma-parināta** (transformed) nature. Therefore, it is the smallest. Compared to it, the **charam-khaṇḍa** (**charamāṇi**) are **asankhyāta** times greater because they are **asankhyāta**.

Now, the question arises: are the **acharam** and the many **charam** together equal to the **charam** or are they **viśeṣādhika**? The **śāstrakāra** provides the solution that the **acharam** and the many **charam** are **viśeṣādhika**. This means that if one **acharam-dravya** is included in the **charam-dravya**, the number of **charam** increases by one. Therefore, their collection is **viśeṣādhika**.

If we consider from the perspective of **pradeśa**, the **charamanta-pradeśa** are the smallest because the **charam-khaṇḍa** are extremely subtle compared to the **madhyama** (**acharam**) **khaṇḍa**. Although the **charam-khaṇḍa** are **asankhyāta** times greater, their **pradeśa** are the smallest compared to the **pradeśa** of the **madhyama** (**acharam**) **khaṇḍa**. Compared to them, the **acharamanta-pradeśa** are **asankhyāta** times greater.

One **acharam-khaṇḍa** is **asankhyāta** times greater in area than the collection of **charam-khaṇḍa**. The **charamanta-pradeśa** and **acharamanta-pradeśa** together are **viśeṣādhika** than the **acharamanta-pradeśa**. This is because the **charamanta-pradeśa** are **asankhyāta** times smaller than the **acharamanta-pradeśa**.

In this situation, even if the **charamanta-pradeśa** are included in the **acharamanta-pradeśa**, they are still **viśeṣādhika** than the **acharamanta-pradeśa**.

Considering both **dravya** and **pradeśa**, according to the above reasoning, the **acharam** of the **ratnaprabhā-pṛthvī** is the smallest because it is one. Compared to it, the **charam** (many **charam**) are **asankhyāta** times greater. Compared to them, both the **acharam** and the many **charam** are **viśeṣādhika**, and compared to them, the **charamanta-pradeśa** are **asankhyāta** times greater. This is because, although the **acharam-khaṇḍa** are **avagāḍha** (dense) than the **asankhyāta-pradeśa**, they are still **asankhyāta** times smaller than the **acharamanta-pradeśa**.

The ultimate extreme / [11 exists, however, in relation to substance it is one, while in the extreme sections each (section) is infinite in extent, therefore the extreme and non-extreme are infinite times greater than the community of substance. In relation to them also, the non-extreme ultimate extent (according to the aforementioned reasoning) is infinite times greater. From them also, the ultimate extent and non-extreme ultimate extent, both together (as before) are more numerous. Just as the smallness and largeness of the ultimate and non-ultimate etc. of the Ratnaprabaha earth should be understood, so also the smallness and largeness of the ultimate and non-ultimate etc. from the Sharkaraprabha up to the Lok should be understood. The smallness and largeness of the ultimate and non-ultimate etc. of the Alok is the least in relation to substance, the non-extreme of the Alok is the least, in relation to it the extreme section is infinite times greater, the non-extreme and extreme sections together are more numerous. From the point of view of extents, the least are the ultimate extents of the Alok, because their existence is only in the non-cut extents. In relation to these ultimate extents, the non-extreme ultimate extents are infinite times greater, because the Alok is infinite. The ultimate extent and non-extreme ultimate extent, both together are more numerous, because the ultimate extent is only a fraction of the infinite part of the non-extreme ultimate extent. Even when they are included in the non-extreme ultimate extents, they all together are still more numerous than the non-extreme ultimate extents. From the point of view of both substance and extent - the least is one non-extreme of the Alok. In relation to it, the extreme section is infinite times greater / the non-extreme and extreme sections together are more numerous. In relation to them, the ultimate extent is infinite times greater and from them also the non-extreme ultimate extent is infinite times greater. The ultimate extent and non-extreme ultimate extent both together are more numerous. The smallness and largeness of the ultimate and non-ultimate etc. of the Lokalok - in relation to substance, the least is one non-extreme each of the Lok and Alok = non-extreme section, because it is only one. In relation to it, the extreme sections of the Lok are infinite times greater. From it, the extreme sections of the Alok are more numerous. From them, the non-extreme section and (very) extreme section of the Lok and the Alok together are more numerous. From the point of view of extents, the least are the ultimate extents of the Lok. From them, the ultimate extents of the Alok are more numerous. From them, the non-extreme ultimate extents of the Lok are infinite times greater. From them, the non-extreme ultimate extents of the Alok are infinite times greater. From them, the ultimate extents and non-extreme ultimate extents of the Lok and Alok both together are more numerous. From the point of view of substance and extent - the least is one non-extreme section each of the Lok and Alok in relation to substance. From it, the extreme sections of the Lok are infinite times greater / from them, the extreme sections of the Alok are more numerous. From them, the non-extreme sections and extreme sections of the Lok and Alok both together are more numerous, etc. / In reality, the extreme sections of the Lok are infinite, yet due to the establishment of the earth [] in this way, they are considered to be eight / they are as follows - one each in the four directions and one each in the four intermediate directions / the extreme sections of the Alok are twelve according to the hypothesis of the establishment of the Alok, this number twelve is neither double nor triple the number eight, therefore it can only be said to be more numerous. In relation to the extreme sections of the Alok, the non-extreme and their extreme sections of the Lok and Alok, 1. Prajnapana Sutra Malay. Vritti, Patranka 231 2. Ibid., Malay. Vritti, Patranka 232

##  Translation:

[12] The **Prajñāpanā Sūtra** are considered **viśeṣādhika** (superior) when combined, because according to the aforementioned reasoning, the **lok** (world) has nine **carma-khaṇḍa** (extreme sections) and only one **acarma-khaṇḍa** (non-extreme section). Similarly, the **alok** (non-world) also has 13 **carma** and **acarma-khaṇḍa** combined. When these two are combined, they become twenty-two. This number twenty-two is not double, triple, or any multiple of twelve, hence it is **viśeṣādhika**.

From the perspective of **pradeśa** (regions), the **carma-anta-pradeśa** (extreme regions) of the **lok** are the least, because they are only **pāṭha** (sections). Compared to them, the **carma-anta-pradeśa** of the **alok** are **viśeṣādhika**. The **acarma-anta-pradeśa** (non-extreme regions) of the **lok** are **asamkhyāta-guṇa** (innumerable times) more than the **carma-anta-pradeśa** of the **alok**, because the **acarma** (non-extreme) region is much larger, and therefore its **pradeśa** are also much larger. Compared to them, the **acarma-anta-pradeśa** of the **alok** are **ananta-guṇa** (infinite times) more, because that region is infinite. Even compared to these, the **carma-anta-pradeśa** and **acarma-anta-pradeśa** of both **lok** and **alok** are **viśeṣādhika**, because even after combining the **carma-anta-pradeśa** of the **lok**, the **acarma-anta-pradeśa** of the **lok**, and the **carma-anta-pradeśa** of the **alok** within the **acarma-anta-pradeśa** of the **alok**, they all remain **asamkhyāta**. And **asamkhyāta** is less than **ananta** (infinite), therefore even after including them, they are still **viśeṣādhika** compared to the **acarma-anta-pradeśa** of the **alok**.

One should consider the **alpa-bahutva** (lesser and greater) of **dravya** (substance) and **pradeśa** based on the aforementioned reasoning. Compared to the **carma-khaṇḍa** of the **lok**, the **carma-khaṇḍa** of the **alok** are **viśeṣādhika**, and compared to them, the **acarma** of both **lok** and **alok**, along with their **carma-khaṇḍa**, are **viśeṣādhika**. The reason for this is the same as before. Compared to them, the **carma-anta-pradeśa** of the **lok** are **asamkhyāta-guṇa** more, and compared to them, the **carma-anta-pradeśa** of the **alok** are **viśeṣādhika**. Compared to them, the **acarma-anta-pradeśa** of the **lok** are **asamkhyāta-guṇa** more. Compared to them, the **acarma-anta-pradeśa** of the **alok** are **ananta-guṇa** more. This is the **yukti** (reasoning). Compared to them, the **carma-anta-pradeśa** and **acarma-anta-pradeśa** of both **lok** and **alok** combined are **viśeṣādhika**.

Compared to the **carma** and **acarma-pradeśa** of both **lok** and **alok**, all **dravya** combined are **viśeṣādhika**, because **ananta-ananta-samkhyaka** (infinitely infinite) **jīva** (living beings), **paramāṇu** (atoms), etc., and **ananta** (infinite) **paramāṇu-ātmaka** (atomic) **skandha** (aggregates) are all individually **ananta-ananta** (infinitely infinite), and they are all **dravya**. Compared to all **dravya**, all **pradeśa** are **ananta-guṇa** more, and compared to all **pradeśa**, all **paryāya** (categories) are **ananta-guṇa** more, because each **pradeśa** has **ananta** (infinite) **sva-para-paryāya** (self and other categories). This is all clear.

**The statement about the carma-acarma, etc., of paramāṇu-pudgala, etc.**

781. **Paramāṇu-pudgala** (atomic particles), **bhaṇte** (venerable sir)! What is **carime** (extreme) and **pracarime** (non-extreme) in their **pravattana** (activity)? Is **carimā** (extremeness) and **pracarimā** (non-extremeness) **avattāvya** (to be stated)?

Many Ultimate, Many Non-Ultimate, Many Undeclared / 'Why is the Atomic Pudgala Declared? - The Lord has declared the Atomic Pudgala as only the third category in the above 26 categories, the remaining twenty-five categories do not occur in it. The reason for this is that ultimateness depends on something else, here there is no other object to be desired, so there is no other object to be desired. In addition, a single atomic pudgala is not a saṃśa (having many parts/components), so that its ultimateness can be imagined in relation to the parts, the atom is nirāṃśa-nirāvayava (without parts/components). The atom is not non-ultimate (middle), because being without components, it does not have a middle part. For this reason, the atom is called declared by rule. Athot - neither can it be called ultimate, nor non-ultimate / What is not worthy of being declared by the word ultimate or non-ultimate is undeclared. In the Dvipradeśīskandha, there are two categories - in the Dvipradeśīskandha, only the first (one ultimate) and the third (one declared), these two categories occur, the remaining twenty-four categories do not. The reason for calling it ultimate is that when the Dvipradeśīskandha is situated in two space regions in a samśreṇī (parallel) and becomes dense, then one atom out of its two atoms is ultimate in relation to the other atom, the other atom is also ultimate in relation to the first atom. For this reason, the Dvipradeśīskandha is called ultimate, but the Dvipradeśīskandha is not called non-ultimate, because non-ultimateness is not possible for all substances / The Dvipradeśīskandha is sometimes declared when it becomes dense in one space region, at that time it becomes transformed like an atom by a special type of oneness-transformation / For this reason, there is no reason to call the Dvipradeśīskandha ultimate or non-ultimate at that time. Therefore, it cannot be called ultimate or non-ultimate, it can only be called 'declared' at that time. In the Tripradeśīskandha, there are four categories - in the Tripradeśīskandha, the first category - 'ultimate' and the category 'declared' should be understood according to the above-mentioned Dvipradeśī's logic. Then the ninth category - 'two ultimate and one non-ultimate' is found. When the Tripradeśīskandha is dense in three space regions situated in a samśreṇī (parallel), then its two atoms at the beginning and end are ultimate (dual) because they are paryantavarti (extending to the end), and the middle atom is non-ultimate because it is madhyavarati (intermediate)! Therefore, the Tripradeśīskandha is sometimes called two ultimate and one non-ultimate. In this, the tenth category - 'many ultimate and many non-ultimate' cannot occur, because in a skandha with three regions (bahuvacanānta) there cannot be many ultimate and many non-ultimate. The eleventh category occurs in it. It is as follows: sometimes ultimate and declared / When the Tripradeśīskandha is dense in a samśreṇī (parallel) and a viśreṇī (perpendicular) in this way, then its two atoms are situated in a samśreṇī (parallel) and can be called ultimate like the Dvipradeśīskandha which is dense in two regions, and one atom is situated in a viśreṇī (perpendicular) and is therefore ultimate 1.

## The Tenth Extreme [25 and Acharam]

[25 and Acharam] are not eligible to be described by the terms 'charam' and 'acharam'. Therefore, in the Tri-Pradeshi Skandha, the first, third, ninth, and eleventh are the four bhangs, the remaining 22 bhangs are not found.

In the Chatush-Pradeshi Skandha, there are seven bhangs. The first, third, ninth, and eleventh bhangs should be understood according to the above mentioned method in the Dwi-Pradeshi and Tri-Pradeshi Skandha. After that, the tenth bhang also occurs in the Chatush-Pradeshi Skandha. It is as follows: two charam and two acharam.

Because when the Chatush-Pradeshi Skandha is situated in four Akash-Pradeshas in a Samashreni, then the two atoms (Pradeshas) at the beginning and end are both charam, and the two atoms in the middle are called acharam (dway). Therefore, it can be called 'two charam and two acharam'.

Similarly, the twelfth bhang - 'one charam and two Pravaktavya' also occurs in it. It is as follows: when the Chatush-Pradeshi Skandha is situated in four Akash-Pradeshas, then according to this arrangement, two of its atoms are in two Akash-Pradeshas in Samashreni, and two atoms are in two Akash-Pradeshas in Vishreni. In this situation, the two atoms in Samashreni are 'charam' like the Dwi-Pradeshi Skandha, which is Dwi-Pradesha-Avagadh, and the two atoms in Vishreni are not eligible to be described by the terms 'charam' or 'acharam' because they are single atoms, so they are Pravaktavya.

Therefore, the Chatush-Pradeshi Skandha can be called 'one charam and two (many) Pravaktavya'. After that, the twenty-third bhang occurs in it.

It is as follows: when the Chatush-Pradeshi Skandha is situated in four Akash-Pradeshas according to this arrangement, then three atoms are situated in three Akash-Pradeshas in Samashreni, and one atom remains in the Akash-Pradesha in Vishreni. In this situation, out of the three atoms in Samashreni, the atoms at the beginning and end are charam because they are Paryantavarti, and the middle atom is acharam, and the one atom in Vishreni is not eligible to be called charam or acharam, so it is Pravaktavya. Therefore, the Chatush-Pradeshi Skandha is called 'two (many) charam, one acharam, and one Pravaktavya'.

Thus, except for the first, third, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, and twenty-third bhangs, the remaining 19 bhangs are not found in it.

In the Pancha-Pradeshi Skandha, there are eleven bhangs. In the Skandha with five Pradeshas, eleven bhangs are found, starting with charam.

The first, third, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, and twenty-third bhangs should be understood according to the above mentioned method. In this, the seventh bhang is 'one charam and one acharam'. It occurs as follows: when the Pancha-Pradeshi Skandha is situated in five Akash-Pradeshas according to this arrangement, then the four atoms at both ends are transformed by the same Sambandhi-Parinam, so they have the same color, smell, taste, and touch, and therefore they can be called 'charam' because they are described as one. But the middle atom is 'acharam' because it is Madhyavarthi. Therefore, the Pancha-Pradeshi Skandha is called 'charam and acharam'.

Page #614:
---------------------------
## 26] This is called the "Prajnapana Sutra Acharam". In this, the thirteenth bhang - "Kathंचित् दो चरम एवं अवक्तव्य" occurs. It is as follows:

When a Panchapradeshi Skandha, according to this establishment, is situated in five Akashapradeshas, then two of its atoms are situated in two Akashapradeshas above in the same series, similarly two atoms are situated in two Akashapradeshas below in the same series, and one atom is situated in the middle. In this situation, the two atoms above are called "Charam" like the "Dwipradeshigaadh Dwayanukaskandha", similarly the two atoms below are also "Charam", thus four "Charam" and one atom, being alone and "Pravaktvy", the entire Panchapradeshi Skandha can be called "Kathंचित् अनेक चरम and Pravaktvy".

In the Panchapradeshi Skandha, the twenty-fourth bhang - "Kathंचित् अनेक चरम, एक अचरम and अनेक अवक्तव्यरूप" also occurs. It is as follows:

When the Panchapradeshi Skandha, according to this establishment, is situated in five Akashapradeshas in the same series and different series, then three of its atoms are situated in three Akashapradeshas in the same series and two atoms are situated in two Akashapradeshas in different series. In this situation, the two atoms at the beginning and end are called "Charam", the middle atom is called "Acharam", and the two atoms situated in the different series are called "Avaktvy". Thus, their collective form, the Panchapradeshi Skandha, can be called "Charam, one Acharam, two Pravaktvy".

Similarly, the twenty-fifth bhang - "Kathंचित् अनेक चरम, अनेक अचरम and एक प्रवक्तव्य" can also occur. It is as follows:

When the Panchapradeshi Skandha, according to this establishment, is situated in five Akashapradeshas in the same series and different series, then four atoms are situated in four Akashapradeshas in the same series and one atom is situated in the different series. In this situation, out of the said four Akashapradeshas, the two at the beginning and end are called "Charam" and the two in the middle are called "Acharam", and the one atom situated in the different series is "Avaktvy". Thus, the entire Panchapradeshi Skandha can be called "two Charam, two Acharam and one Pravaktvy".

Thus, the first, third, seventh, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, and twenty-fifth, these 11 bhangs occur in the Panchapradeshi Skandha, the remaining 15 bhangs do not occur in it.

In the Shatpradeshi Skandha, fifteen bhangs occur - 11 of these bhangs are mentioned in the Panchapradeshi Skandha, they should be understood according to the previous explanation. The remaining four bhangs are as follows: the fourth, fourteenth, nineteenth, and twenty-sixth bhang.

The eighth bhang is - "एक चरम and दो (अनेक) अचरमरूप". It occurs as follows:

When a Shatpradeshi Skandha, according to this establishment, is situated in six Akashapradeshas in the same series, then four atoms situated in the same series, as mentioned earlier...

---------------------------
[Tenth Extreme] [According to 27, 'Extreme' and intermediate are called two atomic Acharama. The group form of Shatpradeshi Skandha can also be called one extreme and two Acharama in some way. The fourteenth Bhang - 'Two extremes and two unmentionable' occurs in this way - when a Shatpradeshi Skandha, according to this establishment, traverses through six celestial regions in Samshreni and Vishreni, then 1. Two of them are above and two below in the celestial regions located in Samshreni, one atom is in the region located in Samshreni in the middle of both categories, and one atom is above both in Vishreni. In such a situation, the two atoms above and the two atoms below are also called 'Extreme', these two extremes are called 'Many Extremes' and the two atoms remaining separate are called two unmentionable. The group form of all these Shatpradeshi Skandha can be called Many Extreme form, Many Unmentionable form in some way / Nineteenth Bhang - Extreme-Acharama-Pravaktvy can also occur in this. It is like this - when Shatpradeshi Skandha traverses through six celestial regions in this establishment, according to 10 one Parikshep from Vishresthi Ekadhik: then the four atoms surrounding (surrounding one) are 'Extreme' according to the aforementioned method, the intermediate one is Acharama and the atom located in Vishreni is unmentionable. The group form of their Shatpradeshatmak Skandha can be called Extreme-Acharama-Pravaktvy / In Shatpradeshi Skandha, the 26th Bhang - Many Extreme-Many Acharama-Many Unmentionable form also occurs. Its method is like this - when Shatpradeshi Skandha traverses through six celestial regions in this establishment, according to 00/... Samshreni and Vishreni, then the two atoms traversing the beginning and end regions are two extremes and the two atoms traversing the middle region are two Acharama and the solitary atoms traversing separately in the two regions located in Vishreni are called two unmentionable. In this way, the group form of Shatpradeshi Skandha can be called Many Extreme-Many Acharama-Many Pravaktvy in some way. In this way, there are 15 aforementioned Bhangs in Shatpradeshi Skandha, the remaining 11 Bhangs are not in it. 17 Bhangs in Saptapradeshi Skandha - In this Skandha, the 15 Bhangs mentioned in the aforementioned Shatpradeshi Skandha are the same / Their analysis should be done according to the aforementioned methods. There are two special Bhangs in this Skandha / They are - Twentieth and Twenty-first Bhang / Twentieth Bhang in Saptapradeshi Skandha - One Extreme-One Acharama-Many (Two) Pravaktvy in some way / It occurs in this way - when its traversal occurs in seven celestial regions, then according to its establishment, 100 due to two-two atoms located in Samshreni at both ends, it is 'Extreme', due to the intermediate atom, it is 'Acharama'

[28] The *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* is a single *avaktavya* and is also multiple *avaktavya* due to the separate, individual atoms located in the *viśreṇī*. Thus, in the combined form of these three, the *saptapradeśīskandha* can be called a single *charma*, a single *acharama*, and multiple *avaktavya*. In this, the 21st *bhanga* also occurs as a single *charma*, multiple *acharama*, and a single *avaktavya*. It is as follows: when it enters the seven *prakāśapradeśa*, then according to its establishment, it is 'charma' in relation to the single atom located at the end of the *samaśreṇī*, it is multiple *acharama* in relation to the two middle atoms, and it is *avaktavya* due to the single atom located in the *viśreṇī*. In the combined form of these three, the *saptapradeśīskandha* can be called a single *charma*, multiple *acharama*, and a single *avaktavya*. Thus, in the *saptapradeśīskandha*, except for the 17 *bhanga*, the remaining 9 *bhanga* are not found. In the *aṣṭapradeśīskandha*, there are 18 *bhanga*. In this *skandha*, the 17 *bhanga* are the same as those mentioned in the *saptapradeśīskandha*. Only the 22nd *bhanga* - a single *charma*, multiple (two) *acharama*, and multiple (two) *avaktavya* is more. The 22nd *bhanga* occurs as follows: when the *aṣṭapradeśīskandha* enters the eight *ākāśapradeśa*, then according to its establishment, it is *charma* in relation to the atoms located at the end of the *samaśreṇī*, it is two *acharama* in relation to the two middle atoms, and it is two *avaktavya* due to the two atoms located in the *viśreṇī*. In the combined form of these three, the *aṣṭapradeśīskandha* can be called a single *charma*, multiple *acharama*, and multiple *avaktavya*. Thus, there are 18 *bhanga* in the *aṣṭapradeśīskandha*, the remaining 8 *bhanga* are not found in it. How does the *anantaananta skandha* enter the *asankhyeya pradeśātmaka* *loka*? Here, a doubt arises: the entire *loka* is *asankhyāta pradeśātmaka*, how does the *asankhyāta pradeśātmaka* and *ananta pradeśātmaka* *skandha* enter it? The solution is, the greatness of the *loka* is such that not only these two *skandha*, but also *anantaananta dvipradeśīskandha* to *anantaananta sankhyātapradeśī*, *anantaananta asankhyātapradeśī*, and *anantaananta anantapradeśī* *skandha* are all contained within this one *loka*, just as the atoms of the light of thousands of lamps reside in a single building like a single lamp. 761. How many *santhāna* are there, *bhnte*? *Go-yamā*! There are five *santhāna*. It is like this: in a circle, 1 is a *vatta*, 2 is a *tanse*, 3 is a *chaurse*, 4 is a *prāyate*, 5 is a *...*.

Just as (in Sūtra 777) the alpabahutva (fewness) of the charma, acharma, etc. of the Ratnaprabhā earth was stated, in the same way, one should understand the alpabahutva of the charma, acharma, etc. of the anantapradeśī and asankhyātapradeśāvagāḍha parimaṇḍala-saṁsthāna. The special feature is that there is anantaguṇa (infinite multiplication) in the saṁkrama (transition). In the same way, one should understand the alpabahutva of the charma, etc. (from the vṛtta-saṁsthāna up to) the prāyatasaṁsthāna. _ The presentation of the alpabahutva of the charma, etc. of the vivecana-viśiṣṭa parimaṇḍala, etc. - In these sixteen sūtras (from Sūtra 791 to 806), the various forms of the parimaṇḍala, etc. saṁsthānas, such as saṁkhyātapradeśika, etc. and saṁkhyātapradeśāvagāḍha, etc. are presented, and the alpabahutva of their acharma-charma, etc. is presented.

In the same way, the avagāhana of the anantapradeśī parimaṇḍala, etc. saṁsthānas is also perhaps in saṁkhyātapradeśas and perhaps in asankhyātapradeśas, but not in anantapradeśas; because the anantapradeśī parimaṇḍala, etc. saṁsthāna cannot be avagāḍha in ananta ākāśapradeśas. From a theoretical point of view, the pradeśas of the entire lokākāśa are only asankhyāta, not ananta, and there cannot be any motion or position of pudgalas outside the lokākāśa.

' Considering the Acharamadichar perspective of the five aforementioned adjectives, the Acharam, Anekacharam, Charamantapradesh, and Acharamantapradesh of the five institutions, namely Parimandaladi, etc., have been considered in terms of their Alpabahutva - from the perspective of both Dravya, Pradesh, and Dravya-Pradesh. / Of these five, excluding the third and fifth, the answer regarding Alpabahutva in relation to the other four, Acharamadi, is almost the same, for example, from the perspective of Dravya, one Acharam is the least, Anekacharam is numerically greater than that, and both one Acharam and Anekacharam together are more special. From the perspective of Pradesh, Charamantapradesh is the least, Acharamantapradesh is numerically greater than that, and both Charamantapradesh and Acharamantapradesh together are more special. And the order and direction of Alpabahutva from the perspective of both Dravya and Pradesh is also the same. The Alpabahutva of the remaining two (Asankhyatpradeshi Asankhyatpradeshavagaadh and Anantapradeshi Asankhyatpradeshavagaadh) in relation to the four Acharamadi is similar to the Alpabahutva of the Charamadi of Ratnaprabhaprithvi. / There are two differences here, where Anekacharam and Acharamantapradesh have been described as Sankhyatgana in the previous context, here Anekacharam and Acharamantapradesh have been described as Asankhyatguna more. The rest is the same as before. Anekacharam is described as numerically greater than one Acharam because the Parimandaladi institutions are Sankhyatpradeshatmak in their entirety. _ 'Anantaguna in Sankrama' means - when there is a transition, i.e., change, from the thinking of the region to the thinking of the Dravya, then the Bahuvachananta Charam is Anantaguna. Its statement is as follows - one Acharam is the least, Bahuvachananta Charam is Asankhyatguna in terms of region and Anantaguna in terms of Dravya. Both Acharam and Bahuvachananta Charam together are more special. This kind of Alpabahutva characteristic is only present in two types of Parimandaladi institutions - (1) Anantapradeshi-Sankhyatpradeshavagaadh institution and Anantapradeshi-Asankhyatpradeshavagaadh institution. / The statement of Charamacharam of Jivas in relation to motion, etc. 807.

## Translation:

**42]** In the *Prajñāpanā Sūtra*, the term "Gati-charam" (extreme of motion) is used in a specific context. For example, if a being is in hell at the time of *pratyakṣa* (death) but will never be born in hell again after leaving it, it can be called "Naraka-gati-charam" (extreme of hellish motion) in a specific sense. However, it cannot be called "Gati-charam" in a general sense because after leaving hell, it will have to be born in another motion. Therefore, the general "Gati-charam" is a human being. In the *Sūtra* concerning the general being, one should understand "Gati-charam" as a human being in a general sense. However, all the *Sūtras* that follow are specific in nature, so the meaning of "Gati-charam" is: a being that will not be born again in the same motion after leaving it is "Gati-charam" in relation to that motion, and one that will be born again in that motion is "Gati-acharam" (non-extreme of motion) in relation to that motion.

**(2)** **Sthiti-charam-acharam** (extreme and non-extreme of state): The extreme of the state-motion is called "Sthiti-charam". If the state (age) experienced by a hellish being at the time of *pratyakṣa* is its final state and it will never experience that state again, then it is called "charam" (extreme) in relation to the hellish state. If it has to experience that state again in the future, then it is "Sthiti-acharam" (non-extreme of state).

**(3)** **Bhava-charam-acharam** (extreme and non-extreme of existence): The extreme of the existence-motion is called "Bhava-charam". That is, if the present existence of a hellish being or any other being at the time of *pratyakṣa* is its final existence, then it is "Bhava-charam", and if its existence is not final, then it is "Bhava-acharam". There are many hellish beings who will not be born again in hell after their present hellish existence; they are "Bhava-charam". But those hellish beings who will be born again in hell in the future are "Bhava-acharam".

**(4)** **Bhāṣā-charam-acharam** (extreme and non-extreme of language): Those beings who are "charam" (extreme) in terms of language, meaning those who have received this language for the last time and will never receive it again, are "Bhāṣā-charam". Those who will receive language again are "Bhāṣā-acharam". One-sense beings are devoid of language because they do not have the tongue sense organ, so they are not counted in the category of "Bhāṣā-charam" or "Bhāṣā-acharam".

**(5)** **Prāṇa-charam-acharam** (extreme and non-extreme of breath): The extreme of the breath-motion is called "Prāṇa-charam". If a being is taking its final breath in that existence at the time of *pratyakṣa* and will not breathe again in that existence, then it is "Prāṇa-charam". Those who are different from this are "Prāṇa-acharam".

**(6)** **Prāhāra-charam-acharam** (extreme and non-extreme of food): The extreme of the food-motion is called "Prāhāra-charam". Generally, liberated humans are "Prāhāra-charam". Specifically, in relation to that motion or existence, the one who is taking its final food is "Prāhāra-charam" in relation to that motion or existence. Those who are different from this are "Prāhāra-acharam".

## Tenth Extreme Position [43 (7)]

The word "भाव" (emotion) here refers to the five emotions: भाव-चरम-अचरम-ग्रौदयिक (emotion-extreme-non-extreme-arising-etc.).  Any emotion that is final for a being, and will never be attained again in the present or future life, is called भावचरम (emotion-extreme). The opposite of this is भावअचरम (emotion-non-extreme).

(8-11)  A being for whom color, smell, taste, or touch is final, and will never be experienced again, is called वर्णादि-चरम (color-etc.-extreme). A being who is experiencing or will experience color, smell, taste, or touch again is called वर्णादि-अचरम (color-etc.-non-extreme).

Through these eleven gates, the answers to questions about the extreme and non-extreme nature of beings from hell to the celestial beings are the same, whether in the singular or plural. A singular hell-being, etc., is sometimes extreme and sometimes non-extreme, meaning some hell-beings, etc., are extreme and some are non-extreme. Similarly, plural hell-beings, etc., are both extreme and non-extreme.

## Eleventh Discourse (Bhaṣāpad) of the Prajñāpanā Sūtra

This is the eleventh discourse (Bhaṣāpad) of the Prajñāpanā Sūtra. Language is a primary means for sentient beings to express their thoughts and feelings. Without it, the exchange of ideas, scholarly and practical studies, and the acquisition of knowledge become difficult. After the mind, 'speech' is a very powerful tool for a being. It can lead to both karma-binding and karma-destruction, both devotion and non-devotion. For this reason, the scholar has composed this discourse on language.

This discourse specifically considers:

* What is language? Is it a seed of understanding (avadhāraṇī-avabodha-bīja)?
* If it is a seed of understanding, then what kind of language is it among the four types of language: truth (satya), etc.?
* If it is all four types, then how?
* Which language is contradictory (virodhanī)?
* What is the source of language? If it is a being, then why?
* Where and how does language originate?
* What is the nature of language?
* How and where does language arise and end?
* How are the particles (pudgala) received and released in the substance of language?
* What is the duration of speech?
* How many types of language are there primarily?
* How many languages are permitted by the Lord among the four types of language presented?
* Which are the sufficient (paryāptikā) languages that can be understood in a representative manner, and which are the insufficient (aparyāptikā) languages that are the opposite?

Then, the ten types of each of the two divisions of sufficient (paryāptikā) language, truth (satya) and falsehood (mṛṣā), are explained in terms of the people (janapada-satya), etc., and anger-generated (krodha-niḥsṛta), etc., respectively. Subsequently, the two divisions of insufficient (aparyāptikā) language, truth-falsehood (satya-mṛṣā) and false-falsehood (asatya-mṛṣā), are explained, with ten and twelve types respectively.

Following this, it is explained which beings are speakers (bhāṣaka) and which are non-speakers (abhāṣaka) among all beings. It is also explained which languages are spoken by the inhabitants of the hell realms (dairya) to the inhabitants of the celestial realms (vaimānika) in the aforementioned four types of language.

In the middle and at the end of this discourse, the language of men, women, and neuter genders (strī-puruṣa-napumsaka-vacana), the language of men, women, and neuter genders that is knowledgeable (strī-puruṣa-napumsaka-prajñāpanī), the language of men, women, and neuter genders that is knowledgeable (strī-puruṣa-napumsaka-prajñāpanī-bhāṣā), and the language that is knowledgeable (prajñāpanī) or unknowledgeable (mṛṣā) are discussed from the perspective of individuals and species.

Is the language spoken by newborn infants or animals like camels in their immature state, except for those with specific knowledge, true?

Then, again, the masculine gender...

## Eleventh Chapter: Primary

**645**  Is the language of singular-plural, feminine singular-plural, neuter singular-plural words, a **Prajnaapani** (truth) or a **Mrusha** (falsehood)? And what are the sixteen types of **Vachan** (number), the four types of language, and the **Paraadhak** (beneficial) and **Viraadhak** (harmful) beings among those who speak with and without use of these? Also, among the four types of speakers: **Satyabhaashaak** (truthful speaker), **Asatyabhaashaak** (untruthful speaker), **Mishrabhaashaak** (mixed speaker), and **Vyavahaarabhaashaak** (practical speaker), who is less, more, equal, or superior to whom? All of this has been discussed in detail.

The **Dravya** (substance) of the language category, i.e., the **Pudgal** (matter) of language, extends to the **Anantpradeshi** (infinite) **Skandha** (aggregate), and that **Skandha** is also **Bhaashaayogya** (fit for language) only if it is located in an **Asankhyaatpradeshi** (innumerable) **Kshetra** (region), otherwise not. From the perspective of **Kaal** (time), the **Pudgal** of language are those that exist from one time to innumerable times, meaning their transformation into language form can last for one time or for innumerable times.

The **Pudgal** taken for language, in terms of their **Roop** (form), **Ras** (taste), **Gandh** (smell), and **Sparsh** (touch), are not the same in every **Bhaashaapudgal** (language matter). They include all types of **Pudgal**. In other words, it is not possible that any **Pudgal** in the form of **Ras**, **Gandh**, etc., is not **Bhaashaayogya** (fit for language). However, in **Sparsh**, only one **Sparsh** is present from the opposing **Sparsh**, therefore, each **Bhaashaapudgal** has two to four **Pudgal** of **Sparsh**.

The **Pudgal** taken for language transform into language form and come out. Only two **Kaal** (time) periods pass in this process: the first is the time of taking and the second is the time of its **Nissarg** (nature).

This is a comprehensive discussion of the many options for **Bhaasha-Dravya** (language substance) taken by a **Jiva** (living being).

The **Bhaasha-Dravya** (language substance) that a **Jiva** takes in the form of language, which are specific to **Varna** (color), **Gandh** (smell), **Ras** (taste), **Sparsh** (touch), etc., are they **Sthit** (located) or **Asthit** (not located)? If they are **Sthit** (located), are they **Aatmasprushta** (in contact with the soul) or not? This means that **Pudgal** are filled throughout the **Lokakasha** (universe), but the **Aatma** (soul) is only the size of the body. In this situation, the question arises: does the **Jiva** take **Bhaashaapudgal** from anywhere or only those **Pudgal** that are in contact with the **Aatma**?

Along with this, other solutions have also been given:

1. The **Jiva** only takes **Aatmasprushta** (in contact with the soul) **Bhaashaapudgal**.
2. The **Aatma**'s **Pradesha** (region) is as vast as the **Aakasha** (space), and the **Bhaashaapudgal** located in those regions are taken.
3. The **Bhaashaapudgal** that are **Niranta** (continuous) from that particular **Aatma-Pradesha** (soul region), i.e., the **Bhaashaapudgal** that are uninterruptedly present in that particular **Aatma-Pradesha** (soul region), are taken.
4. Whether those **Pudgal** are in the form of a small **Skandha** (aggregate) or in the form of a **Baadar** (cloud), they are taken.
5. Such **Bhaasha-Dravya** (language substance) taken are located in the **Urdhva** (upper), **Adhah** (lower), or **Tiryag** (horizontal) direction.
6. The **Jiva** takes these **Bhaasha-Dravya** (language substance) at the beginning, middle, and end.
7. And he takes them **Praanapurvi** (in order), taking the **Aasann** (nearby) one first.
8. And he takes **Bhaasha-Dravya** (language substance) that come from any of the six directions.
9. If a **Jiva** continuously speaks for a certain time, he has to continuously take **Bhaasha-Dravya** (language substance).
10. If he does not keep speaking continuously, he takes it **Saantar** (intermittently).
11. Language reaches the end of the **Lok** (universe). Therefore, the **Nirmaan** (emission) of **Pudgal** taken in the form of language happens in two ways: (1) In the same amount as...

46] [If the Prajñāpanā Sūtra has been received, the mass of all those pudgalas exits in the same form (as it is), that is, the speaker expels the mass of pudgalas of the bhāṣā vargaṇā in an undivided form, that mass is destroyed after going a certain yojana (its bhāṣā form transformation ends). (2) If the speaker expels the received pudgalas by dividing (separating) them, then those masses become subtle, they are not destroyed quickly, but rather they influence other pudgalas that come into contact with them (transform them into bhāṣā form). For this reason, they increase infinitely and touch the end of the loka. * Such division of bhāṣā pudgalas occurs in five ways: khaṇḍa, pratar, cūṇikā, anuttaṭikā, and utkarikā, this has been explained with an example and in a brief way.' 1.

"Do I think that language is a determiner?" "Do I think that language is a determiner?" "Do I think that language is a determiner?" "Do I think that language is a determiner?" "Yes, Gautama!

"O Blessed One! Is language true, false, both true and false, or neither true nor false?" "Yes, Gautama! It is true, it is false, it is both true and false, it is neither true nor false." "O Blessed One! How is it said that language is true, false, both true and false, or neither true nor false?" "Yes, Gautama! It is true by affirmation, 1 it is false by negation, 2 it is both true and false by affirmation and negation, 3 it is neither true nor false by neither affirmation nor negation, or by both affirmation and negation, this is the fourth type of language. 4" "O Blessed One! How is it said that language is true, false, both true and false, or neither true nor false?"

##  48] [Prajñāpātasūtra [831 pr.] Bhagavan! Is the language of understanding (avadhāriṇī bhāṣā) true, false, a mixture of true and false, or neither true nor false? [831 u.] Gautama! It (avadhāriṇī bhāṣā) may be true, it may be false, it may be a mixture of true and false, and it may also be neither true nor false. [pr.] Bhagavan! Why do you say that (avadhāriṇī bhāṣā) may be true, may be false, may be a mixture of true and false, and may also be neither true nor false? [u.] Gautama! The language that is conducive to worship (ārādhaṇī) is true, the language that is not conducive to worship (virādhaṇī) is false, the language that is both conducive and not conducive to worship (ārādhaṇī-virādhaṇī) is a mixture of true and false, and the language that is neither conducive to worship, nor not conducive to worship, nor both, is the fourth type called neither true nor false (asatyāmṛṣā).  O Gautama! This is why it is said that the language of understanding may be true, may be false, may be a mixture of true and false, and may also be neither true nor false. 

**Explanation:** The nature and four types of the language of understanding are discussed in these two sūtras (830-831). In the first sūtra, Śrī Gautama Svāmī has sought the Lord's judgment on the nature of language based on his own contemplation and thought. In the second sūtra, the Lord has also determined the four types of the language of understanding. 

**Explanation of "language" and "understanding":** The etymological meaning of "language" is that which is spoken (bhāṣī jāe), that is, spoken. Its scholastic definition is: "Language is the aggregate of substances that are emitted (from the mouth, etc.) after being transformed into the form of language by taking in (pudgalas)." 

**"Language is understanding":** This means that language is capable of conveying understanding, it is the seed (cause) of understanding. Because the meaning of "avadhāriṇī" is that by which the understanding or certainty of an object is achieved. 

**The essence of the first sūtra:** In the first sūtra (830), Śrī Gautama Svāmī has repeated the same question six times in different ways to seek the Lord's judgment on the truth of his opinion regarding the nature of language. 

**Its meaning is as follows:** (1) Bhagavan! I believe that language is capable of conveying understanding. (2) I (also) think (logically) that language is understanding. In this way, Śrī Gautama Svāmī presents his opinion before the Lord and seeks his judgment on its truthfulness by asking these two questions again: (3) Bhagavan! Do I believe that language is understanding? (4) Bhagavan! Do I (logically) think that language is understanding? That is, is my belief and thinking correct? To get the Lord's seal of approval on the truthfulness of this opinion, Śrī Gautama Svāmī presents these two questions again in a different form: 1. 'Bhāṣyate iti bhāṣā' 2. 'Tadyogyatayā pariṇāmitanisajyamānādravyasaṃhatiḥ, eṣa padārthaḥ /' 3. Avdhāryate-avagamyate'rtho'nayeti avadhāriṇī-avabodha bījabhūtā ity arthaḥ /  Prajñāpanā. Malaya. Vṛtti, patrāṅka 246

[Eleventh Chapter] [49] Just as I believed and thought before that language is a means of understanding, I still believe and think the same way that language is a means of understanding. This means that there is no difference between my current contemplation and thinking and my previous contemplation and thinking. / Lord! Is my contemplation and thinking faultless and logical? _The answer given by the Lord, in which the verbs like 'Mannāmi' 'Chitemi' etc. are used in the third person singular, should be understood as being used in the second person singular due to the style of the Prakrit language and the use of the word 'Pārṣa'. From this perspective, the meaning of the answer repeated by the Lord in these six sentences is as follows: 'Yes, Gautama! (Your contemplation and thinking are true /) You believe and think logically that language is a means of understanding, I also know this from my Kevala Jnana. Even after this, you believe that language is a means of understanding, you contemplate with certainty that language is a means of understanding. Therefore (as you believed and thought before) believe and think the same way that language is a means of understanding, do not doubt it even for a moment.' The explanation of Satya, Mṛṣā, Satya-Mṛṣā and Asatya-Mṛṣā - Satya = That which is beneficial for the righteous men, the monks or the refined people, i.e. that which helps in the worship of this world and the next world and leads to liberation, is Satya language because the saints and monks are righteous men due to being the true followers of the Lord's commands, this is beneficial for them / Or, Sant means - the fundamental qualities and the subsequent qualities, which are the most beautiful because they lead to the attainment of liberation in the world, that which is beneficial for them or Sat means - the existing things like Jiva etc. taught by the Lord, that which is suitable or conducive or helpful in presenting them as they are, is Satya. Mṛṣā - That which is opposite in nature to Satya language, is Bhūṣā. Satya-Mṛṣā - That in which both truth and falsehood are mixed, i.e. that in which there is some truth and some falsehood, is Satya-Mṛṣā or mixed language / Asatya-Mṛṣā - That language which cannot be included in these three types of languages, i.e. that which cannot be called true, false or both, or that in which the characteristics of any of these three languages do not occur, is Asatya-Mṛṣā. The subject of this language is - to call or address or to give commands etc. The recognition of the four languages of Satya etc. - Pārādhānī, that which is used for the worship of the path of liberation, is Ārādhānī language.

That language which is Ārādhānī should be considered Satya language. That which is Virādhānī is Mṛṣā - that which 1. Prajñāpanā Sūtra Malaya. Vatti, Letter No. 247 2.

**50]**  A language that contradicts the path to liberation as described in the *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* is a *virādhanī* language.  A language that contradicts the omniscient view, with the intention of establishing the opposite, such as "there is no soul," or "the soul is eternally solitary," or "the soul is eternally non-solitary," etc., is a *virādhanī* language.  Or, a language that, while true, is also harmful to others, is a *virādhanī* language.  Similarly, a language that contradicts the *ratnatraya* (three jewels) path to liberation is also a *virādhanī* language.  A *virādhanī* language should be considered *mṛṣā* (false).  A language that is both *pārādhanī* and *virādhanī* is *satyāmṛṣā* (partially true and partially false).  A language that is partially *ārādhanī* (affirmative) and partially *virādhanī* is called *ārādhanī-virādhanī*.  For example, if five children are born in a village or town, but someone says, "Ten children were born in this village or town today," then this language is *ārādhanī* in the sense that it is affirmative in the part that says "five children were born," but it is *virādhanī* in the sense that it is false in the part that says "ten children were born."  Thus, according to the *sthūla vyavahāra nayā* (gross practical view), this language is *ārādhanī-virādhanī*.  Such a language is *satyāmṛṣā*.  A language that is neither *pārādhanī* nor *virādhanī* is *asatyāmṛṣā* (neither true nor false).  A language that does not have the characteristics of *ārādhanī*, and which is not *virādhanī* because it does not cause harm to others or contradict the truth, and which is not *ārādhanī-virādhanī* because it is not partially affirmative and partially false, should be considered *asatyāmṛṣā*.  Such a language is usually a command or an invitation, such as "Monk! Perform *pratikramaṇa*!" or "Write the *sthāṇḍila*!" etc.

Yes, Gautama!

After this, the question is - is the language prajñāpanī, which is a woman-prajñāpanī in the category, a man-prajñāpanī in the category, or a neuter-prajñāpanī in the category? Is this language not false? [838 u.] Yes, Gautama! The language that is a woman-prajñāpanī in the category, the language that is a man-prajñāpanī in the category, or the language that is a neuter-prajñāpanī in the category, this is prajñāpanī language and this language is not false / Discussion - Prajñāpanī language is presented from various perspectives - In these seven sūtras (from sū. 832 to 838), prajñāpanī satya-bhāṣā is presented from various perspectives, such as animal-bird name-prajñāpanā, woman etc. gender-description, woman etc. ājñāpanī, woman etc. prajñāpanī, woman etc. gender prajñāpaka in the category, woman etc. prajñāpanī in the category, and woman etc. prajñāpanī in the category / Meaning of 'prajñāpanī' language - The language that makes the prajñāpan - presentation or presentation of the meaning (object) is called 'prajñāpanī language' / It can also be called prajñāpanīya or arthapratipādini. _ What kind of prajñāpanī language is mentioned in the seven sūtras and why is it true? (1) The words like cow etc. described in sū. 832 are generic, for example, saying cow means understanding the cow category and there are all three genders, male, female and neuter, in the category. Therefore, although words like cow etc. are trilingual, they are prajñāpanī because they are used to state the object of the language spoken in one gender, and they are true because they state the real object, because no matter what gender the word is, if it is generic, then according to the country, time and context, it means the objects of all three genders within that category. This language is neither oppressive nor spoken with the intention of deceiving anyone / Therefore, this prajñāpanī language cannot be called false. (2) Similarly (described in sū. 833), words like school, garland etc. are feminine (feminine language), words like pot, cloth etc. are masculine (masculine language) and words like wealth, forest etc. are neuter (neuter language), but these words do not have the characteristics of femininity, masculinity or neuterness / For example, it is said that one should understand as a woman who has large breasts and hair, one who has hair on all parts of his body is called a man, and one who does not have the characteristics of both man and woman is called a neuter. According to the above characteristics of woman etc., in words like school, garland etc. which are feminine, words like pot, cloth etc. which are masculine, and words like wealth, forest etc. which are neuter, none of the characteristics of woman etc. are present. In such a situation, one word is feminine, one is masculine and one is neuter

##  [53 Eleventh Chapter]

Is it wise language to call something neuter, and is it true, not false? The Lord has answered yes. When any word is used, it does not denote the characteristics of a woman, man, or neuter as previously mentioned. The genders of words with different genders are arranged according to the rules of grammar or the tradition of the Guru's teachings. Thus, this language is wise because it conveys the reality of the object in question, rather than the literal usage. It is not used with any corrupt intention, nor does it cause any suffering. Therefore, this kind of wise language is true, not false.

(3) According to Sutra 834, the question is: Is the language that commands a woman, a man, or a neuter, respectively, a woman-commanding, man-commanding, or neuter-commanding language, wise and true? Because wise language is true, while this is only commanding language, used only to give commands. It is not certain that the one who is commanded will act accordingly. Perhaps they will not. For example, if a lay person tells a lay woman, "Do Samayik every day," or a lay person tells his son, "Worship Dharma as appropriate," or a lay person tells a neuter, "Contemplate the nine principles," if the one who is commanded does not act according to the command, in such a situation, will the language of the one who gave the command be called wise and true? The Lord's answer is that the language which is commanding for a woman, man, or neuter, that commanding language is wise, not false. The meaning is that commanding language is of two types: otherworldly-hindering and otherworldly-hindrance-non-producing. Of these, the language that is spoken to the obedient woman, man, or neuter, with the understanding of self-benefit, without any deceit, for the attainment of some otherworldly fruit, or for the accomplishment of some specific worldly task, is not otherworldly-hindering. This is the wise language for the virtuous, and it is true. But the other kind of language, which produces self-and-other-distress, is otherworldly-hindering, and therefore unwise and false.

(4) The meaning of the question in Sutra 835 is: Is this language, which describes the characteristics of a woman, a man, and a neuter, respectively, wise language and true, not false? The meaning is that "khatva," "ghata," and "vanam" are words for the feminine, masculine, and neuter genders, respectively. These words are also used elsewhere due to usage. Of these, "khatva" (bed) does not have the specific characteristics of breasts and hair, etc., similarly, the word "ghata" does not have the characteristics of a man, and "vanam" does not have the characteristics of a neuter. Nevertheless, of these three, the feminine word "khatva" is the word for the object "khatva," the masculine word "ghata" is the word for the object "ghata," and the neuter word "vanam" is the word for the object "vanam." In such a situation, even though there are no characteristics of a woman, etc., is the language that describes the characteristics of a woman, etc., wise and true? This doubt arises. The Lord's answer is that the language which is woman-commanding, man-commanding, or neuter-commanding, that language is wise, not false. The meaning is that the characteristics of a woman, etc., are of two types: one according to literal usage, and the other according to the Vedas. According to literal usage, the use of any gendered word according to the rules of grammar or the usage of that language is wise language, and it is true. Similarly, according to the Vedas (desire for liberation), to convey the meaning is...

**54]**  [If the language is based on knowledge, then using words according to the characteristics of women, etc., and representing the real meaning, such language is called *prajnaapani*, not *mrsha*. (5) The meaning of Sutra 836 is that the word in the feminine gender (feminine noun) in the sense of *jati* (general), such as *satta*, and the word in the masculine gender (masculine noun) in the sense of *jati*, such as *bhavah*, and the word in the neuter gender in the sense of *jati*, such as *samaanyam*, is this language *prajnaapani* and true, not *mrsha*? This means that the meaning of *jati* here is general. General has no relation to gender nor to number (singular, plural, etc.) / Others have accepted the relation of objects with gender and number. Therefore, if only the singular and neuter gender are relevant in *jati*, then trilingata (three genders) is not possible, but words denoting *jati* are used in all three genders, such as *satta*, etc. / In such a situation, there is doubt whether this type of *jatyaatmak* trilingi language is *prajnaapani* and true or not? The Lord's answer is - the *jati* words which are feminine, masculine, and neuter (such as *satta*, *bhavah*, and *samaanyam*), this language is *prajnaapani*, not *mrsha*, because here the *jati* word is the indicator of the general. It is not one, without parts, and inactive, as conceived by others, because such a belief is contradicted by evidence / In reality, the common transformation of an object is general, and the common transformation is multi-faceted / Dharma is inseparable from each other and from the Dharmi / Therefore, trilingata is also possible in *jati*. For this reason, this language is *prajnaapani* and not *mrsha*. (6) The meaning of the question formulated in Sutra 837 is that the language which is *stri-prajnaapani* (feminine-directive) in relation to *jati*, such as 'This Kshatriyaani will do this', and the language which is *purusha-prajnaapani* (masculine-directive) in relation to *jati*, such as 'This Kshatriya will do this', similarly, the language which is *napusak-aagnaapani* (neuter-directive), is this language *prajnaapani*? Is this language not *mrsha*? The meaning is that the language by which any woman, etc., is given any directive, is *aagnaapani* language. But it is not certain that the one who is given the directive will perform the action according to that directive. If he does not do it, then is that *aagnaapani* language called *aprajnaapani* and *mrsha* or not? Resolving this doubt, the Lord says, Yes, Gautama! The *aagnaapani* language which is directive to women, men, and neuters in relation to *jati*, is *prajnaapani* itself, and it is not *mrsha*. This means that the *aagnaapani* language which does not cause obstacles in the afterlife, which is spoken to instruct polite women, etc., who are worthy of being instructed, who are capable of performing the desired work with the understanding of self-benefit, such as - 'O Sadhvi! Today is an auspicious constellation, therefore study such and such limb or Shruta-skandha.' Such *aagnaapani* language is *prajnaapani*, blameless, true, but the language which is *aagnaapani* but contrary to the aforementioned fact, i.e., which causes harm to oneself and others, then that language is *aprajnaapani* and *mrsha*. (7) The meaning of the question formulated in Sutra 838 is that the language which is *stri-prajnaapani* in relation to *jati*, i.e., which describes the characteristics (form) of a woman, such as a woman is naturally insignificant, she has an abundance of pride, her senses are fickle, she is weak in patience, and the language which is *purusha-prajnaapani* in relation to *jati*, i.e., which describes the characteristics (form) of a man, such as a man is naturally serious, does not become cowardly even in the face of adversity or trouble, and does not abandon patience, etc. / Similarly, the language which describes the form of a neuter in relation to *jati*, such as - a neuter is naturally attached and he is in the form of...

[Eleventh Chapter] [55 The great fire burns with flames, etc. / The meaning is that although there are no qualities of the female, male and neuter genders that have been mentioned above, yet sometimes a different feeling is also seen in someone / For example - some women are also serious-minded and excellent in character, on the contrary, some men are also naturally frivolous, fickle-minded and cowardly when faced with a little adversity, and some eunuchs are also less attached and virtuous. Therefore, the doubt arises whether the aforementioned type of language should be considered wise or false? In answer to this, the Lord says that the language which is female-wise or eunuch-wise is wise, i.e. true language, not false. The meaning of this is that the description of caste qualities is done keeping in mind the majority, not in relation to one individual. This is the reason why when it is necessary to describe the qualities of an entire caste, the wise describers use the word 'generally'. They say - 'Generally it should be understood'. Where the word 'generally' is not used, it should be understood from the context / Therefore, if sometimes a person is found to be opposite to the caste quality, then also due to the majority, there is no fault, so that language is wise.

The five-sutra conclusion related to the camel, etc. - The scholar has repeated the same language as the previous five sutras regarding the camel, etc., so the conclusion of this five-sutra is also that except for a specific knower or a Jati-smara-knower (Sanjni), no camel, etc., has any knowledge of these or other such things. The Vrittikara has indicated a special point regarding the five sutras related to the camel, etc., that the camel, etc., in these five sutras should be understood as being in the most infantile state, not in the mature state; because it is possible for a mature camel, etc., to have knowledge of these things.' 1.

##  Explanation of the Ten Sutras in the Context of Language:

[58] This Ten Sutras, in relation to language, is an explanation.  The topic of language was discussed in the previous sutras. Therefore, these ten sutras also indirectly address certain specific aspects related to language.  This Ten Sutras reveals that language is of two types: one is the language of the restrained, which is appropriate (used) in the right way, and the other is the language of the unrestrained, which is inappropriate (unused).

**The one who speaks with understanding of the context and by considering the meaning through scriptural knowledge is called appropriate.** He knows that "I am speaking this." But the one who, due to the dullness (underdevelopment) of the senses or due to the imbalance or distortion of the wind (vata) etc., loses consciousness and becomes distracted, manic, insane, or intoxicated, cannot connect the context. Therefore, he speaks by imagining things in his mind, and he is called inappropriate. In that state, he does not even know "What am I speaking? What am I eating? Who are my parents? Where is my master's house? And who is my master's son?" Therefore, it seems that the intention of the scholar is that whatever he speaks in such an inappropriate state (dull or distorted state of consciousness) is not true language.

The same applies to the camel etc. The explanation of "dull boy, dull girl" in language - Children etc. are also seen speaking, but which of the four types of language mentioned above is their language? This is the doubt that Sri Gautam Swami's questions address.

**Meaning of Dull Boy:** A simple-minded, newborn infant or an ignorant little child whose understanding (comprehension) is not yet mature, who speaks in a stammering way, who has very little knowledge of things. Similarly, a dull girl is also an ignorant child. The question is, when such an ignorant child receives language-worthy pudgalas and transforms them into language and emits them in the form of speech, does he know that "I am speaking this," or "I am eating this," or "These are my parents," or "This is my master's house," or "This is my master's son?" The Lord says, "Except for the one with knowledge, this is not possible."

Although that ignorant child is sufficiently equipped with language and mind, his mind is still undeveloped. Due to the dullness of the mind, his destruction and pacification are also slow. The destruction and pacification of the scriptural knowledge covering karma usually arises from the support of the sharpness of the mind, which is both scripturally accepted and a matter of common experience.

**Explanation of the one with knowledge:** Here, the word "one with knowledge" does not mean "one with a similar mind," but rather "one who has knowledge." Knowledge means perception knowledge, knowledge of remembering the category, or the specific sharpness of the mind. Those children or camels who, even in their infancy, possess such specific knowledge (one with knowledge), they know these things.

The determination of the knowledge-based nature of language with singular, plural, and feminine forms is found in 846.

This language is not false. 857. In this way, Bante! Is this language prajnapni when speaking in the feminine, masculine or neuter? Is this language not false? [857 U.] Yes, Gautama! When speaking in the feminine, masculine or neuter, this language is prajnapni, this language is not false. / Discussion - The decision of the prajnapnita of a specific language, such as singular and feminine, etc. The present nine sutras (from 849 to 857) present a decisive view on the subject of prajnapni language in relation to number, gender, command, prajnapana, etc. Explanation of the question-answer in the present nine sutras - (1) The meaning of the question formulated in Sutra 849 is that from man to chilllalaka and other similar words, being singular, are they singular? That is - is this type of language a language that expresses singularity? The implication is that - the object is dharmamisamudayaatmak, and infinite dharmas are found in every object. / Saying 'man' means that the dharma: dhammisamudayaatmak is the whole (unbroken), complete object, and the same is seen in practice. But singular is used for one object and plural is used for many objects. From this point of view, 'man' has been used here as a singular, while 1. Granthagram 4000 /

The **Prajñāpanā Sūtra** reveals the understanding of multiple religions within the human realm, despite the singular nature of the human being. In the world, we use singular terms for practical purposes. In such a situation, is the use of singular forms appropriate for a language that emphasizes unity, like the one used for humans and other beings? The Lord's answer is that terms like "human" and "ant" are all indicative of unity. This means that the meaning of words is subject to the speaker's intention, which can vary depending on the context and purpose. For example, the same person can be referred to as "father" by his son and "teacher" by his student. Similarly, when the focus is on the individual (the **dharmi**) and the religions (the **dharma**) are secondary, the singular form is used because the individual is one. In this case, all religions are encompassed within the individual, leading to a comprehensive understanding. However, when the focus shifts to the religions and the individual becomes secondary, the plural form is used because there are many religions, even though the individual is one. In conclusion, the singular form is used when the focus is on the unity of the individual and the religions, while the plural form is used when the focus is on the multiplicity of religions, with the individual being secondary. Even in the case of beings with infinite religions, like humans, the singular form can be used to represent their unity as individuals. Therefore, this language emphasizes unity.

(2) The question posed in **Sūtra 850** is whether terms like "humans" and "ants," which are plural, are indicative of multiplicity. This implies that these terms are generic and refer to a common essence. It is said that this essence is one, eternal, indivisible, inactive, and omnipresent. In this case, how can these generic terms be plural? This is the reason for the question. The Lord's answer is that terms like "humans" and "ants" are indicative of multiplicity. This is because, although these terms are generic, the essence they represent is a result of similar characteristics, and similar characteristics are inseparable from dissimilar characteristics. In other words, common characteristics and uncommon characteristics coexist and are somewhat inseparable. Therefore, when the focus is on the common characteristics, which are accompanied by dissimilar characteristics that vary in each individual, the use of the plural form is appropriate, similar to the use of the plural form for "pots" and other objects. When the focus is solely on the common characteristics, with dissimilar characteristics being secondary, the common characteristics are one and the same everywhere, making the use of the singular form appropriate. For example, "All pots are thick and round-bellied." In the case of terms like "humans," the focus is on the common characteristics accompanied by dissimilar characteristics, which are numerous.

## Eleventh Chapter of Language

**Reason for using plural here is appropriate.** (3) The meaning of the question formulated in Sutra 851 is: "Are all the words from 'Manushi' to 'Chillalika' and other similar words ending in 'ya' and 'ee' feminine? In other words, is all this language indicative of femininity?" The implication of this question is that everything here is tri-gendered. For example, "(Ayan) Mrutrupa" (transformed into clay) is masculine, "(Iyan) Mrutparinat Ghatakara Parinat" (transformation of clay into a pot shape) is feminine, and "(Idam) Vastu" (object) is neuter. Thus, the same sentence is expressed here by words indicative of all three genders. In such a situation, how can a word indicative of only one feminine gender be truly indicative of an object expressed by all three genders? In the word "Narsinha," only the word "Nar" or only the word "Simha" cannot be indicative of both - Nar and Simha - but in common usage, feminine words are seen as indicative of their respective objects. Therefore, the question arises: Are all such words indicative of femininity? The answer of the Lord is "Yes." From Manushi to Chillalika and other similar words ending in 'aa' and 'ee' are feminine, meaning they are indicative of a specifically feminine meaning. The meaning of this is as follows: - Although objects are of many Dharmic natures, the law of linguistics is that the Dharmic nature from which the specific object is to be indicated is considered primary, and the rest of the Dharmic natures are considered secondary and disregarded. For example, a man has masculinity, scholarship, generosity, enjoyment, procreation, and teaching, yet when his son sees him coming, he says, "Father is coming"; his disciple says, "Teacher is coming." Similarly, here too, all the words like Manushi, although tri-gendered, are primarily indicative of Yoni, Maduta, Asthirata, Chapalata, etc. (femininity), and when the object is indicated with these specific Dharmic natures as primary, then the language like Manushi, etc., is called Strivak, meaning feminine language. (4-5) The reasons for the questions formulated in Sutras 852 and 853 should also be understood as before: - (4) Are the words from Manushya to Chillalak and other similar words Purushavak - meaning, is all this language indicative of masculinity? And (5) Are the words from Kansa to Ratna and other similar words Napusakavachan, meaning, is all this language indicative of neuter gender? The meaning of their answers should also be understood as before. The conclusion is that although words like Manushya, etc., and words like Kansa, etc., are tri-gendered, they are called masculine (Purushavachan) and neuter (Napusakavachan) respectively due to the primary intention of the masculine or neuter Dharmic nature. (6) The conclusion of the question and answer in Sutra 854 is that "Prithvi" is Strivak (language indicative of a specifically feminine meaning), the word "Aap" is Puvak (language indicative of a specifically masculine meaning), and the word "Dhanya" is Napusakvak (language indicative of a specifically neuter meaning). This language is Prajnapani, meaning true, not false, because it indicates the true meaning. It should be noted here that the word "Aau" (Aap = water) is masculine according to the grammar of the Prakrit language, but according to the Sanskrit language, it is feminine. (7) The meaning of the question formulated in Sutra 855 is: "Prithvim Kuru, Prithvim Anay" (Create the earth, bring the earth), this type of language is Stri (feminine) Agyapani (commanding). "Aap Anay" (Bring water), this type of language is Purusha (masculine) Agyapani (commanding). And "Dhanyam Anay" (Bring grain), this type of language is Napusak (neuter) Agyapani (commanding).

[64] The language of Prajñāpanā is Prajñāpanī, is this language Prajñāpanī? Is it not false? The Lord has given an affirmative answer, which means that since the intention is to refer to the feminine, masculine and neuter genders respectively in the three aforementioned places, by making other religions secondary, this language propounds the unique earth, ap and grain-like religions. (8) The meaning of the question formulated in Sū. 856 is that is this language, which is 'earth' as a feminine Prajñāpanī (a model of femininity), 'sin' as a masculine Prajñāpanī (a model of masculinity) and 'grain' as a neuter Prajñāpanī (a model of neuterness), a language of worship (not contradictory to the path of liberation)? Is this language false? In other words, does the practitioner who speaks in this way not encounter the occasion of false speech? The Lord said in reply that this language is a language of worship (worthy of worship on the path of liberation), it is not false; because this language is one that propounds the true nature of things in relation to verbal usage. (6) The question formulated in Sū. 857 is hyperbolic in its entirety. Its meaning is that if, in the manner described above, a speaker refers to a feminine object in the feminine gender, a masculine object in the masculine gender and a neuter object in the neuter gender, is the speaker's language Prajñāpanī (true), not false? The Lord also gives an affirmative answer to this. Which means that it is Prajñāpanī, there is no fault in it according to verbal (according to the rules of language) usage. Fault arises only when the nature of the object is something else and the statement is made in a different form. If the object is spoken of as it is, what fault is there in that?'

[Eleventh Language Chapter] [859-Uttaratmaka Gathaarth] Language originates from the body / Language is spoken at two times / Language is of four types, of which two languages (for speaking by God) are permitted / / 193 / / Discussion-The comprehensive nature of language from various perspectives-The two sutras presented here describe the origin, place of origin, form, end, time of speaking, type, permissible type, etc. of language. The fundamental cause of language-What is the (original) root cause of language in addition to the material cause of language? This is the first question. The answer is that the living being is the root cause of language because without the various efforts of the living being, such as pronunciation, etc., the origin of language is not possible. Acharya Bhadrabahu Swami has said- There are (atma) regions associated with the living being in the Audarik, Vaikriya and Aharak bodies, from which the living being receives language substances. Thereafter, the receiver (that speaking living being) speaks that language, i.e., abandons the received language substances. The origin of language-Where does language originate from? In answer to this question, it is said that language is body-born, i.e., language originates from the Audarik, Vaikriya and Aharak bodies, because the language substance is emitted from the power of one of these three bodies / The institution-form of language-Language is said to be Vajrasan sthita, which means that the shape of language is like a thunderbolt; because the language substances emitted by the specific effort of the living being are spread throughout the world and the world is of the form of a thunderbolt / Therefore, language is also called Vajra-shaped. Where does language end? Language ends at the end of the world (lokanta). That is, where the world ends, there language ends; because beyond the lokanta, the absence of the Dharma-astikaya, which helps in movement, makes the movement of language substances impossible; this is what I and the rest of the Tirthankaras have established. From what yoga does language originate? -Here in the first gatha, the question is asked, from what yoga does language originate? From Kaya yoga, Vachan yoga or Man yoga? In answer, as before, 'Sarira-pphava' (body-born) is said, but the commentator interprets it as Kaya yoga-pphava; because first, by Kaya yoga, it receives the pudgals suitable for language, transforms them into the form of language, and then by Vachan yoga, it emits them-pronounces them / Therefore, it is appropriate to call language 'Kaya yoga-pphava' / Acharya Bhadrabahu Swami says- The living being receives (language-worthy pudgals) by Kayik yoga and emits (them) by Vaachik yoga / 2 1.

## 66 [The Time of Corruption of the Language of the Prajñāpanā Sūtra - A living being speaks language at two times, because at one time it takes in language-worthy pudgalas and at another time it transforms them into the form of language and releases (removes) them. Types of Language - Previously, four types of language have been explained along with their forms - satya, mṛṣā (asatya), satyamṛṣā (mixed) and asatyamṛṣā (practical) language  /  /  Permitted Languages - The Lord has permitted the sadhu-varga to speak two types of language - satyabhāṣā and asatyamṛṣā (practical) language  /  The implication of this is that the Lord has not permitted the speaking of mixed (satyamṛṣā) language and mṛṣā (false) language, because both these languages do not present the true nature of things, therefore they are opposed to liberation.']

**Or, to say "Maasha", "Karshapan", "Muhar" (Guinea), "Rupee", etc., after seeing a particular mark (seal) imprinted on mud, silver, gold, etc.**

**(4) Naamsatya:** The language which is considered true only because of its name, is called Naamsatya. For example, a person who does not increase his family, is still called "Kulvardhan" (one who increases the family).

**(5) Roopsatya:** The language which is true only because of a particular form (dress, etc.) is called Roopsatya. For example, if a person has taken on the form (disguise) of a sage with pride, calling him "sage" is Roopsatya language.

**(6) Pratiityasatya:** The language which is true in relation to another object is called Pratiityasatya. For example, calling the ring finger "Kanishtha" (smallest) in relation to the little finger, and "Hrasva" (short) in relation to the middle finger, is Pratiityasatya language.

**(7) Vyavhaarsatya:** The language which is true from the point of view of practice - the intention of the people - is called Vyavhaarsatya. For example, someone said, "The mountain is burning." Here, it was said by considering the grass on the mountain as inseparable from the mountain. Therefore, the language of the speaker, according to the practice of the people, is also Vyavhaarsatya.

**(8) Bhavasatya:** The language which is spoken based on the feeling, i.e., the intensity of the color, etc., is called Bhavasatya. In other words, using language based on the quality that is found in abundance in a substance is Bhavasatya language. For example, even though all five colors are present in a flock of herons (Balaka), calling it white.

**(9) Yogasatya:** Yoga means connection, combination; the language which is considered true because of it is called Yogasatya. For example, calling someone "Chatri" (one who has an umbrella) because of the connection with the umbrella, even if he does not have an umbrella at the time of using the word. Similarly, calling someone "Dandi" (one who has a staff) because of the connection with the staff.

**(10) Praupamyasatya:** The language which is considered true because of the comparison is called Praupamyasatya. For example, "Gavaya" (a kind of deer) is like a cow. This type of language, based on comparison, is called Praupamyasatya.

**Explanation of the ten types of "Paryaptika" language:**

**(1) Krodhnihsrita:** The language spoken out of anger.

**(2) Maannihsrita:** To say that we have also experienced wealth in the past, to show off one's own self-importance, even though it is not true, is Maannihsrita.

**(3) Mayanihsrita:** The language spoken with the intention of deception, etc.

**(4) Lobhnihsrita:** To say that the weight and measurement are correct, even though it is false, due to greed, is Lobhnihsrita.

**(5) Preya (Rag)nihsrita:** To say "I am your servant" out of excessive love for someone, is Preya (Rag)nihsrita.

**(6) Dwashnihsrita:** To speak ill of the Tirthankaras, etc., out of hatred.

**(7) Hasya nihsrita:** To lie in jest.

**(8) Bhaynihsrita:** The language spoken out of fear. For example, someone speaks nonsense or gibberish out of fear of thieves, etc., his language is Bhaynihsrita.

**(9) Prakhyaayika nihsrita:** To speak of impossible things while telling a story.

**(10) Upghaat nihsrita:** The language spoken with the intention of hurting someone's heart. For example, to accuse someone of being a thief, or to call someone blind or lame.

**Explanation of the two types of "Satyamasha" language:**

**(1) Utpannamisrita:** To speak by mixing the born (those who have been born) with the unborn (those who have not been born) to complete the number. For example, even if there are fewer or more babies born in a village or city, to say that ten babies were born in this village or city today.

**(2) Vigtamisrita:** Vigta means dead. What is not past is Avigta.

## Translation:

**70]  **[Prajñāpanasūtra]  **Mixing the past (deceased) with the present (living) to fulfill the count /  For example, in a village or city, even if a few or many elders die, to say that twelve elders died in this village or city today. This language is a mixture of the past, a truth-lie. (3)  **Mixing the born and the dead** - Even when the number of born and dead is fixed, to say it with confusion. (4) **Mixing the living** - There is a heap of conch shells, etc., in which there are many living and some dead, to say, looking at that one heap, how big a living mass it is, this is a living-mixed truth-lie language, because this language is true in relation to the living conch shells and false in relation to the dead conch shells. (5) **Mixing the non-living** - To say, looking at a heap of many dead and a few living conch shells, "What a big heap of dead ones," this type of language is called non-living-mixed truth-lie language, because this language is also true in relation to the dead and false in relation to the living. (6) **Mixing the living and non-living** - Looking at the same aforementioned heap, even if there is a discrepancy in the number, to say definitively that there are so many dead and so many living / Here, the existence of living and non-living is true, but to say their number definitively is false. Therefore, this is a living-non-living-mixed truth-lie language. (7) **Mixing the infinite** - Radish, carrot, etc., are called infinite-bodied. Some plant-bodied are also mixed with them, to say, looking at them, "All these are infinite-bodied," this language is infinite-mixed truth-lie. (8) **Mixing the individual** - A heap of individual plant-bodied is kept together with the infinite-bodied, to say, looking at it, "All this is individual plant-bodied," this type of language is individual-mixed truth-lie. (6) **Mixing the time** - Time is called "praddhā." Here, the context should be taken from "praddhā" as day or night, in which both are mixed and said / For example, even though the day is still going on, to say to someone, "Get up, it's night." Or, even though the night is still remaining, to say, "Get up, the sun has risen." (10) **Mixing the half-time** - "Addhā" means one part (portion) of the day or night time. The language by which those time portions are mixed and spoken. For example, even though the first watch is going on, to say to someone, in order to make them hurry, "Come on, it's noon," such language is praddhā-addhā-mixed.

**Twelve types of untruthful language explained -** (1) **Pramāntraṇī** - Language indicating address. For example, "O Devadatta!" (2) **Prājñāpanī** - By which one gives an order to another. For example, "You do this work." Prājñāpanī language is one that makes another person engage in work. (3) **Yācanī** - Language used to request (ask) for something / For example, "Give me." (4) **Pṛcchnī** - To ask a specific expert about a doubtful or uncertain thing out of curiosity, "What is the meaning of this word?" (5) **Prajñāpano** - Language in the form of advice for polite disciples, etc. / For example, "Those who abstain from killing living beings have a long life in the next birth." (6) **Pratyākhāyanī** - The language by which the rejection of a certain thing is made or revealed. For example, "Today you are abstaining from eating for one watch." Or, to say to someone who is requesting, "I cannot give you this thing." (7) **Iccḥānulomā** - The language that is in accordance with desire 1. "Pāṇivahāu niyattā havanti dīhāu yā prarogā ya / Emāī paṇṇattā paṇṇavaṇī vīyarāgehiṁ / / -Praśāpanā. M. Vṛtti. P. 259

## Eleventh Chapter of Language

**[71] Be agreeable to the speaker, i.e., support the desired meaning of the speaker. It can have many forms:**

**(1)** For example, someone might say to a teacher or elder, "With your permission (desire), I wish to perform Pratikraman." 
**(2)** Someone might say to a companion, "If you wish, do this work." 
**(3)** "Do this work, I permit it (or I desire it)." 
This type of language is called **Icchaanuloma** (agreeable to desire).

**(8)** **Anbhigrihita** - Language that does not grasp a fixed meaning, where the speaker's language does not have a definite form of action, is **Anbhigrihita** language. For example, if someone has many tasks before them, they might ask their elder or experienced person, "Which task should I do now?" They might reply, "Do whatever seems appropriate." Such language does not decide on a specific task, hence it is called **Anbhigrihita** language.

**(10)** **Sanshayakarani** - Language that reveals multiple meanings and creates doubt in the mind of the listener. For example, someone might say to someone, "Bring the **Saindhava**." The word **Saindhava** has many meanings, such as horse, salt, cloth, and man. Hearing the word "Saindhava," doubt arises whether they are asking for salt, a horse, etc. This is **Sanshayakarani** language.

**(11)** **Vyakruta** - Language whose meaning is clear, for example, "This is a pot."

**(12)** **Avyakruta** - Language whose meaning is extremely profound or uses unclear (unintelligible) letters is **Avyakruta** language, because it is not understandable. These are twelve types of **Apariaapta Asatyamrusa** language. This language is distinct from the characteristics of the aforementioned **Satya**, **Mrusa**, and **Misra** languages, so it is neither called **Satya**, nor **Asatya**, nor **Satyamrusa**. This language is only a facilitator of behavior, and it is considered suitable for even the virtuous to speak.

**Regarding all beings, the speaker-listener form:**

**867.** "Monk, are beings **Bhasaga** or **Prabhasaga**?"
"Layman, beings are both **Bhasaga** and **Prabhasaga**."
"How, Monk, are beings said to be both **Bhasaga** and **Prabhasaga**?"
"Layman, beings are classified into two ways, namely, those who are **Samsarasamavannag** and those who are **Prasamsarasamavannag**."
"Among them, those who are **Prasamsarasamavannag** are **Siddhas**, and **Siddhas** are **Prabhasaga**."
"Among them, those who are **Samsarasamavannag** are classified into two ways, namely, those who are **Selasipradivannag** and those who are **Aselasipradivannag**."
"Among them, those who are **Selasipradivannag** are **Prabhasaga**."
"Among them, those who are **Aselasipradivannag** are classified into two ways, namely, those who are **Egidia** and those who are **Pranegidia**."
"Among them, those who are **Egidia** are **Prabhasaga**."
"Among them, those who are **Pranegidia** are classified into two ways, namely, those who are **Pajjattag** and those who are **Apajjattag**."
"Among them, those who are **Pajjattag** are **Prabhasaga**."
"Among them, those who are **Apajjattag** are **Bhasaga**."
"Therefore, Layman, beings are said to be both **Bhasaga** and **Prabhasaga**."

[867 Q] Lord! Are living beings speakers or non-speakers? [867 A] Gautama! Living beings are both speakers and non-speakers. [Q] Lord! Why do you say that living beings are both speakers and non-speakers? [A] Gautama! Living beings are said to be of two types. They are as follows: those who have attained the end of the world and those who have not attained the end of the world. Among them, those who have attained the end of the world are Siddhas, and Siddhas are non-speakers. And among those who have not attained the end of the world (worldly beings), they are also of two types: those who have attained the state of being a Shaleshi and those who have not attained the state of being a Shaleshi. Among those who have attained the state of being a Shaleshi, they are non-speakers. Among those who have not attained the state of being a Shaleshi, they are said to be of two types. They are as follows: those with one sense (stationary) and those with many senses (mobile). Among those who have one sense, they are non-speakers. Among those who have many senses, they are of two types. They are as follows: those who are sufficient and those who are insufficient. Those who are insufficient are non-speakers. Those who are sufficient are speakers. Gautama! For this reason, it is said that living beings are both speakers and non-speakers. 868. [868 Q] Lord! Are beings in hell speakers or non-speakers? [868 A] Gautama! Beings in hell are both speakers and non-speakers. [Q] Lord! Why do you say that beings in hell are both speakers and non-speakers? [A] Gautama! Beings in hell are said to be of two types. They are as follows: those who are sufficient and those who are insufficient. Among them, those who are insufficient are non-speakers, and those who are sufficient are speakers. Gautama! For this reason, it is said that beings in hell are both speakers and non-speakers. 866. In the same way, one should understand continuously (consistently) about all (from those with two senses to the gods in the Vaimānika heaven) except those with one sense. The discussion about all living beings being speakers and non-speakers, presented in three sutras (sutras 867 to 869), analyzes the speaking and non-speaking nature of all living beings, and describes the speaking and non-speaking nature of the twenty-four types of worldly beings from those in hell to those in the Vaimānika heaven. Why are beings with one sense non-speakers? - Because they are devoid of the sense of tongue, beings with one sense are only non-speakers. 1.

[Eleventh Discourse] The Four Types of Speech and Their Manifestation in All Living Beings 870. How many, O Lord, are the types of speech?  Gautama! There are four types of speech. They are: (1) Satya (Truthful) speech, (2) Mṛṣā (False) speech, (3) Satya-mṛṣā (Truthful-false) speech, and (4) Pra-satya-mṛṣā (Untruthful-false) speech.  /  [870 Pr.] O Lord! How many types of speech (forms of language) are there?  [870 U.] Gautama! There are four types of speech.  /  They are: (1) Satya (Truthful) speech, (2) Mṛṣā (False) speech, (3) Satya-mṛṣā (Truthful-false) speech, and (4) Pra-satya-mṛṣā (Untruthful-false) speech. 871. O Lord! Do living beings speak Satya (Truthful) speech, Mṛṣā (False) speech, Satya-mṛṣā (Truthful-false) speech, or Pra-satya-mṛṣā (Untruthful-false) speech?  Gautama! Living beings speak Satya (Truthful) speech, Mṛṣā (False) speech, Satya-mṛṣā (Truthful-false) speech, and Pra-satya-mṛṣā (Untruthful-false) speech.  /  [871 Pr.] O Lord! Do living beings speak Satya (Truthful) speech, Mṛṣā (False) speech, Satya-mṛṣā (Truthful-false) speech, or Pra-satya-mṛṣā (Untruthful-false) speech?  /  [871 U.] Gautama! Living beings speak Satya (Truthful) speech, Mṛṣā (False) speech, Satya-mṛṣā (Truthful-false) speech, and Pra-satya-mṛṣā (Untruthful-false) speech.  /  872. O Lord! Do the inhabitants of hell speak Satya (Truthful) speech, Mṛṣā (False) speech, Satya-mṛṣā (Truthful-false) speech, or Pra-satya-mṛṣā (Untruthful-false) speech?  Gautama! The inhabitants of hell speak Satya (Truthful) speech, Mṛṣā (False) speech, Satya-mṛṣā (Truthful-false) speech, and Pra-satya-mṛṣā (Untruthful-false) speech.  /  [872 Pr.] O Lord! Do the inhabitants of hell speak Satya (Truthful) speech, Mṛṣā (False) speech, Satya-mṛṣā (Truthful-false) speech, or Pra-satya-mṛṣā (Untruthful-false) speech?  [872 U.] Gautama! The inhabitants of hell speak Satya (Truthful) speech, Mṛṣā (False) speech, Satya-mṛṣā (Truthful-false) speech, and Pra-satya-mṛṣā (Untruthful-false) speech.  /  873. And so it is with the Asura-kumāras (sons of the Asuras) up to the Thani-kumāras (mammals).  [873] (You should understand the same about the language of the Asura-kumāras (sons of the Asuras) up to the Thani-kumāras (mammals).) 874. The Dwīndriya (two-sensed), Trīndriya (three-sensed), and Caturindriya (four-sensed) beings do not speak Satya (Truthful) speech, nor Mṛṣā (False) speech, nor Satya-mṛṣā (Truthful-false) speech, but they speak Pra-satya-mṛṣā (Untruthful-false) speech.  /  [874] The Dwīndriya (two-sensed), Trīndriya (three-sensed), and Caturindriya (four-sensed) beings do not speak Satya (Truthful) speech, nor Mṛṣā (False) speech, nor Satya-mṛṣā (Truthful-false) speech, but they speak Pra-satya-mṛṣā (Untruthful-false) speech.  /

[Eleventh Chapter] [77] It also takes in five-colored substances. (But) in comparison to the all-inclusive, it regularly takes in five-colored substances. Such as - black, blue, red, yellow and white. [8]  O Gautama! Does the being take in one-quality black substances, or does it take in infinite-quality black substances? [877-8 Q] Gautama! It takes in one-quality black substances, and it also takes in infinite-quality black substances.  And so it is with white substances. [877-8 A] [8]  O Gautama! Does the being take in one-quality fragrant substances, or does it take in two-quality fragrant substances? [877-9 Q] Gautama!

Jain Terms Preserved:

[11] The jiva (living being) grasps the bhavata (possessing qualities) rasaṃtāī (flavored) grahati (takes) them, does it grasp only ekarasāī (one-flavored) or does it grasp yāvat (up to) pañcarasāī (five-flavored)? Gautama! With reference to grahaṇadravyāiṃ (grasped substances), it grasps even ekarasāī (one-flavored) yāvat (up to) pañcarasāī (five-flavored) also, but with reference to sarvagrahaṇaṃ (complete grasping), it niyamā (definitely) grasps pañcarasāiṃ (five-flavored).

[12] The jiva which grasps the bhavata (possessing qualities) tittarasāiṃ (bitter-flavored), does it grasp ekaguṇatittarasāī (one-quality bitter-flavored) yāvat (up to) aṇantaguṇatittarasāiṃ (infinite-quality bitter-flavored)? Gautama! It grasps ekaguṇatittarasāī (one-quality bitter-flavored) yāvat (up to) aṇantaguṇatittarasāī (infinite-quality bitter-flavored) also. Similarly, it should be said regarding the grasping of madhura (sweet) rasa.

[13] The jiva grasps the bhavata (possessing qualities) phāsamaṃtāī (touch-possessing), does it grasp ekaphāsāiṃ (one-touch) yāvat (up to) aṭṭhaphāsāī (eight-touch)? Gautama! With reference to grahaṇadravyāiṃ (grasped substances), it does not grasp ekaphāsāī (one-touch), dviphāsāī (two-touch) yāvat (up to) catuphāsāiṃ (four-touch) also, but not pañcaphāsāiṃ (five-touch) yāvat (up to) aṭṭhaphāsāī (eight-touch). With reference to sarvagrahaṇaṃ (complete grasping), it niyamā (definitely) grasps catuphāsāiṃ (four-touch), such as śītaphāsāī (cold-touch), uṣiṇaphāsāiṃ (hot-touch), giddha-phāsāiṃ (oily-touch), lukkha-phāsāiṃ (dry-touch).

He takes the objects that are his own (tangible), but he does not take the objects that are not his own (intangible). [22] Venerable Sir! Does he take the objects that are his own (tangible) in a sequential manner or does he take them in a non-sequential manner? Gautama! He takes them in a sequential manner, not in a non-sequential manner. [877.22 A] Bhagavan! Does the living being take the objects that are his own (tangible) in a sequential manner or does he take them in a non-sequential manner? [877-22 A] Gautama! (He takes those tangible objects) in a sequential manner, not in a non-sequential manner. [23] Venerable Sir! Does the living being take the objects that he takes in a sequential manner from three directions or does he take them from six directions? [877-23 A] Gautama! (He) takes those objects regularly from six directions.

Venerable Sir! Does the living being take the objects that he takes in the form of language in a discontinuous manner or does he take them continuously? _ Gautama! He takes those objects both discontinuously and continuously. While taking them discontinuously (the living being) takes them with a minimum interval of one time and a maximum interval of countless times; and while taking them continuously, he takes them with a minimum interval of two times and a maximum interval of countless times, every time, without interruption (pause), continuously.

Eleventh Language Chapter [83]

**With respect to the number of years:**

* A language substance can be composed of one, two, or up to five years.
* However, with respect to the totality of substances, i.e., the collection of all substances that are taken in, they are regularly composed of five years. (8)

**With respect to color:**

* A language substance can be one-quality black to infinite-quality black.
* Similarly, one should understand this with respect to blue, red, yellow, and white colors. (9)

**With respect to smell:**

* A language substance can be one-smell or two-smell.
* However, with respect to the totality of substances, it only takes in two-smell substances. (10)

* A language substance can be one-quality fragrant to infinite-quality fragrant.
* Similarly, it can be one-quality foul-smelling to infinite-quality foul-smelling. (11)

**With respect to taste:**

* A language substance can be one-taste.
* However, with respect to the totality of substances, it regularly takes in five-taste substances. (12)

* A language substance can be one-quality bitter to infinite-quality bitter.
* Similarly, one should understand this with respect to pungent, astringent, sour, and sweet tastes. (13)

**With respect to touch:**

* The language substances that a living being takes in to transform into language are not one-touch, because there are always two touches in one atom.
* Therefore, these substances are two-touch, three-touch, or four-touch.
* However, they are not five-touch to eight-touch.
* With respect to the totality of substances, it regularly takes in four-touch language substances, which are cold, hot, oily, and rough. (14)

* The language substances that a living being takes in to transform into language can be one-quality cold to infinite-quality cold.
* Similarly, one should understand this with respect to hot, oily, and rough language substances. (15)

**With respect to the location of the substance:**

* The substances that a living being takes in to transform into language, from one-quality black to infinite-quality rough, are in contact with its own space, not separate from it.
* It takes in substances that are within its space (i.e., substances that are located in the same space as the living being), not those that are outside of it.
* Specifically, it takes in substances that are directly within its space (i.e., substances that are located in the same space as the living being without any obstruction), not those that are indirectly within its space (i.e., substances that are located in the same space as the living being but are obstructed).
* The substances that are directly within its space can be both small (i.e., substances that occupy a small space) and large (i.e., substances that occupy a large space).

* The living being takes in the language substances that are within its space in all directions: upward, downward, and sideways.
* It takes them in at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end.

These language substances are:

1. The cause itself is the end, subtle, eternal, and atomic.
2. It is one-taste, one-smell, one-color, two-touch, and a sign of its function.

84] [Prajñāpanasūtra (svagochara, i.e., perceptible, well-understood, and intimately understood) are present, not aviṣaya (not svagochara, i.e., different from perceptible, well-understood, and intimately understood), and the jīva also receives those substances sequentially (in order - according to proximity to the object of perception), not non-sequentially (violating proximity), and receives the language substances that come from the six directions according to the rule, because the bhāṣaka trasajīva residing in the trasanāḍī receives the substances of all six directions according to the rule. (16) The jīva receives the substances that it receives as language both intermittently (with some time interval in between or intermittently) and continuously (continuously - without any interval in between). If the jīva receives language substances intermittently, then it receives them with an interval of a single moment in the inferior case and an interval of countless moments in the superior case. If someone speaks continuously, then one should understand an interval of a single moment in relation to that. For example, a speaker receives certain pudgalas of language in the first moment, expels them in the second moment, and expels the pudgalas received in the second moment in the third moment. In this way, there is only reception in the first moment, both reception and expulsion in the middle moments, and only expulsion in the last moment. How can the reception and expulsion of bhāṣapudgalas, these two mutually contradictory actions, occur in the same moment? 1 The solution to this doubt is that although according to Jain doctrine two uses are not possible in the same moment, but actions can be many in the same moment, there is no contradiction in their happening / A single dancer performs various actions with her hands, feet, etc., while performing actions like walking, etc., this is seen directly. The production and consumption of all things is seen in the same moment, similarly the mutually contradictory efforts of reception and expulsion of language substances can also occur in the same moment. Therefore, it has been said that if the jīva continuously receives language substances without interruption, then it receives them continuously for a minimum of two moments and a maximum of countless moments / The word 'anusamaya' has been used to prevent the misconception that someone might think that there is only one reception for countless moments, which means 'after one moment'. The word 'avirahita' has been used to prevent the misconception that someone might understand 'anusamaya' even if there is an interruption in between. In this way, there is only reception in the first moment, not expulsion; because expulsion is not possible without reception. And in the end, when the intention of language ceases, there is no reception, only expulsion occurs / The rest (middle) second, third, etc. moments have both reception and expulsion together / But the pudgalas received in the previous moment are released only in the subsequent moment. It does not happen that the pudgalas that are received in a particular moment are also expelled in the same moment (17) The jīva expels the substances received as language intermittently, not continuously, because the jīva does not expel the substances that it receives in the same moment in which it receives them, i.e., the bhāṣapudgalas received in the first moment are not expelled in the first moment, but in the second moment, and the substances received in the second moment are expelled in the third moment, and so on / The conclusion is that the substances received in the previous moments are 1.

Eleventh Chapter | (85 It extracts in the next-next time. It is possible to have nature only when it is first received, not when it is not received. Therefore, it is said that nature is transient. Nature is called transient in relation to reception. The nature of the received substance is continuous, i.e., in the next time, it is naturally continuous. From this point of view, the time of continuous reception and nature is from the shortest two times to the longest innumerable times. ) The description of the outflow and reception-outflow of the language substances in the form of difference-non-difference 880.  O Bhagavan! The living being, in the form of language, extracts the received substances, does it extract those substances as different (differentiated-separated) or as non-different (not separated)? [880 Ans.] Gautama! (A living being) extracts different substances, (and another) also extracts non-different substances. The substances that (the living being) extracts as different, those substances, increasing by infinite multiplication, increase and increase, touch the end of the world. And the substances that it extracts as non-different, those substances, going up to the innumerable immersion-categories, attain difference. Then, going further up to the innumerable yojanas, they attain destruction. 881. O Bhagavan! How many types of differences are stated for those substances? [881 Ans.] Gautama! Differences are stated to be of five types. They are as follows - (1) Khandabheda, (2) Patrabheda, (3) Chunniyabheda, (4) Anutattikabheda and (5) Utkattikabheda (Utkarrikabheda). [882 Q.] What is that Khandabheda? 1. (a) It becomes different by the Khandabheda of (a) the body, (b) the non-body, (c) the body, (d) the body, (e) the body, (f) the body, (g) the body.

---------------------------
The **Prajñāpanā Sūtra** states that the categorization of **dravya** (matter) from **sthita** (permanent) and **asthita** (impermanent) to **alpabahutva** (few and many) should be applied to all living beings, from **nairāyika** (hell beings) to **vaimānika** (celestial beings), excluding **ekendriya** (one-sensed beings).

There are two types of speakers based on the emission of different **bhāṣādravyas** (speech matter): **tīvra-prayatna** (intense effort) and **manda-prayatna** (weak effort). A speaker with **manda-prayatna**, due to illness, old age, or disrespect, emits **bhāṣādravyas** that are **abhinna-sthūlakhaṇḍarūpa** (undivided and gross) and **avyakta** (unmanifest). A speaker with **tīvra-prayatna**, due to health, strength, and respect, emits **bhāṣādravyas** that are **khaṇḍa-khaṇḍa** (piece by piece) and **sphuṭa** (clear).

**Bhāṣādravyas** emitted by a speaker with **tīvra-prayatna**, due to their fragmented and subtle nature, acquire **ananta-guṇa-vṛddhi** (infinite merit) by permeating other **dravya** and reach the end of the **loka** (universe), pervading the entire **loka**. **Bhāṣādravyas** emitted by a speaker with **manda-prayatna** do not reach the end of the **loka**. They travel to **asankhyāta avagāhana vargaṇā** (innumerable regions of descent), where they become **bheda** (separated), and then, after traveling **saṅkhyāta yojana** (countable yojanas), they are **vidhvasta** (destroyed).

The **dravya** that are grasped as **ekatva** (oneness) and **pṛthaktva** (separateness) in the form of **daṇḍaka-asatyāmaṣābhāṣā** (ten categories of false speech) are **sthita** (permanent) and not **asthita** (impermanent). In this context, there are ten **daṇḍaka** including **vikaleṇdriya** (disabled-sensed beings), which are: **nārika** (hell beings), **bhavanapati** (guardian deities), **dvīndriya** (two-sensed beings), **trīndriya** (three-sensed beings), **caturindriya** (four-sensed beings), **tiryancha-pañcendriya** (animals with five senses), **manushya** (humans), **vāṇavyantara** (intermediate celestial beings), **jyotiṣka** (luminous celestial beings), and **vaimānika** (celestial beings).

Alternatively, the ten **daṇḍaka** or **pālapka** (protectors) are: one **daṇḍaka** for the reception of **bhāṣādravyas** by a single **jīva** (living being), and four **daṇḍaka** for the reception of four different **bhāṣādravyas**. Thus, there are five **daṇḍaka** in the singular and five in the plural, making a total of ten **daṇḍaka**.

The **daṇḍaka** for **ekatva** and **pṛthaktva** are: four **daṇḍaka** in the singular and four in the plural for the reception and emission of **dravya** of four **bhāṣā** (languages), excluding **ekendriya**, from **nairāyika** to **vaimānika**. This makes a total of eight **daṇḍaka**.

The categorization of **prārādhaka** (affirmative), **virādhaka** (negative), and **alpabahutva** (few and many) for sixteen **vacana** (grammatical voices) and four **bhāṣājāta** (language types) is as follows:

**16 Vacanas:**

1. **Egavacana** (singular)
2. **Duvacana** (dual)
3. **Bahuvacana** (plural)
4. **Ithikyana** (locative)
5. **Pumkyana** (masculine)
6. **Gapusagavacana** (neuter)
7. **Ajzhatthavacana** (instrumental)
8. **Uvaniya-vacana** (dative)
9. **Pravaniya-vacana** (accusative)
10. **Uvaniya-uvaniya-vacana** (dative-dative)
11. **Pravaniya-uvaniya-vacana** (accusative-dative)
12. **Tolavacana** (vocative)
13. **Paduppanna-vacana** (ablative)
14. **Pranagavacana** (genitive)
15. **Pacchakkhavacana** (nominative)
16. **Parokkha-vacana** (indirect)

[Eleventh Chapter] [866]  O Bhagavan! How many types of speech are there? [896] Gautama! There are sixteen types of speech. They are as follows: 1. Singular, 2. Dual, 3. Plural, 4. Feminine, 5. Masculine, 6. Neuter, 7. Spiritual, 8. Introduced, 9. Introduced-by-others, 10. Introduced-and-introduced-by-others, 11. Introduced-by-others-and-introduced, 12. Past, 13. Present, 14. Future, 15. Direct, and 16. Indirect. [867]  O Bhagavan! Is this speech, which is spoken in these sixteen ways, from singular to indirect, a Prajnapani (knowledge-giving) speech? Or is it a false speech?

How many types of speech are there? [898]  Gautama! There are four types of speech. They are as follows: (1) One type of speech is true, (2) another type of speech is false, (3) a third type of speech is true-false, and (4) a fourth type of speech is false-false. [866]  O Bhagavan! When a being speaks these four types of speech, is he an Aradhak (worshipper) or a Viradhak (opposer)? [866]  Gautama! When a being speaks these four types of speech in a useful way (payukt), he is an Aradhak (worshipper), not a Viradhak (opposer). But (that is, different from the one who speaks in a useful way) the one who is unrestrained, unstopped, does not oppose or reject evil deeds, and speaks true speech, as well as the one who speaks false speech, true-false speech, and false-false speech, is not an Aradhak (worshipper), but a Viradhak (opposer).

Jain Terms Preserved:

The Blessed Lord said: "O Gautama! Among the Jivas (living beings) who are Saccabhāsaga (truth-speakers), Mosabhāsaga (false-speakers), Saccāmosabhāsaga (truth-and-false-speakers), Prasaccāmosabhāsaga (predominantly truth-and-false-speakers), and Prabhāsaga (non-speakers), which ones are less, more, equal, and specially more in number?"

Gautama replied: "O Blessed Lord! The Saccabhāsaga Jivas are the least in number. The Saccāmosabhāsaga Jivas are innumerable times more than them. The Mosabhāsaga Jivas are innumerable times more than the Saccāmosabhāsaga Jivas. The Prasaccāmosabhāsaga Jivas are innumerable times more than the Mosabhāsaga Jivas. And the Prabhāsaga Jivas are infinitely more than the Prasaccāmosabhāsaga Jivas."

This exposition on the gradation of the five types of Jivas in terms of their Prājñapanātva (truthfulness) and Āradhakātva-Virādhakātva (worthiness of reverence or otherwise) is presented in the five sutras (896 to 900).

## Eleventh Language Chapter [93]

**Four Types of Language Speakers: Paraadhak or Viraadhak?**

Those who use all four types of language correctly, with the intention of protecting the purity of the teachings (Sangha), and who speak with the awareness of the importance and insignificance of things to protect the teachings (Sangha) from slander and impurity, are considered **Aaraadhak** (worshippers) of the order of monks, not **Viraadhak** (opponents).

However, those who are different from those who speak with proper use, and are **Asanyat** (lacking restraint in mind, speech, and body), who are not **Savadhavyaapaar** (free from harmful actions like violence, etc.), who have not **Pratihat** (destroyed) their past sins by saying **Micchami Dukkadam** (May my mistakes be forgiven) and accepting atonement, and who have not renounced future sins, are considered **Viraadhak**, not **Paraadhak**, regardless of whether they speak **Satyabhasha** (truthful language), **Mrusha** (false language), **Satyamrusha** (mixed truth and falsehood), or **Asatyamrusha** (mixed falsehood and truth).

**The Reality of the Fewness of Speakers of the Four Languages**

While discussing the fewness of speakers of the four languages, the text states that **Satyabhasha** speakers are the fewest. This is because only those who speak with **Samyak Upayog** (correct use) and **Dristi** (insight) based on **Sarvjnamata** (omniscience) are **Satyabhasha** speakers, and they are very rare.

**Satyamrusha** speakers are countless times more than **Satyabhasha** speakers because many people in the world speak a mixture of truth and falsehood.

**Mrusha** speakers are countless times more than **Satyamrusha** speakers because many people in the world speak with deceit due to being under the influence of **Kashaya** (passions) like anger, etc.

**Asatyamrusha** speakers are countless times more than **Mrusha** speakers because all beings from **Dwiindriya** (two-sense) to **Panchendriya** (five-sense) fall into this category.

**Abhashak** (non-speakers) are countless times more than all the above because **Abhashak** include **Siddh** (liberated beings) and **Ekendriya** (one-sense beings), both of whom are infinite.

**Vanaspatikayik** (plant-bodied beings) are countless times more than **Siddh** beings.

This is the twelfth body-section of the Prajñapanasutra. * In the cycle of existence, the living being has a very close and continuous connection with the body. It is due to attachment and possessiveness towards the body and the animate and inanimate objects related to it that karma-bondage occurs. Therefore, it is essential to know about the body!

## Twelfth Body Chapter: Primary

[95] The two bodies, **Ātmā** and **Kāya**, are never liberated until the living being attains **Siddhī** (liberation). These two bodies have been connected with the living being since the beginning of time. Even when the living being transmigrates for rebirth, these two bodies are always present. The other bodies, such as **Audārika**, are formed later.

This chapter then discusses the number and types of bodies possessed by each of the twenty-four **Daṇḍakas**. It further explores the five bodies in relation to the living being, both in their bound state (during the present life) and in their abandoned state (before liberation). The chapter also examines the size of these bodies in terms of **Dravya** (substance), **Kṣetra** (space), and **Kāla** (time).

Subsequently, the chapter discusses the size of the five bodies of **Nairyikas**, **Bhavana-vāsīs**, **Ekaindriyas**, **Vikaleindriyas**, **Tiryac-pañcendriyas**, **Manushyas**, **Vāṇavyantara**, **Jyotiṣka**, and **Vaimānika** Devas, in terms of **Dravya**, **Kṣetra**, and **Kāla**, both in their bound and liberated states. This discussion is highly interesting from the perspective of **Gaṇita-vidyā** (mathematics).

## The Twelve Bodies: The Twelfth Body - The Five Types of Bodies

**601. How many types of bodies are there, Master?**

**[901 A.]** Gautam, there are five types of bodies. They are:

1. **Audārika** (Physical Body)
2. **Vaikriya** (Transformational Body)
3. **Āhāraka** (Nourishment Body)
4. **Tejas** (Radiant Body)
5. **Karma** (Karmic Body)

**Explanation of the Five Types of Bodies:**

This sūtra (901) describes the five types of bodies, namely Audārika, etc., as established in Jain doctrine.

**Body** refers to that which is constantly decaying and deteriorating from the moment of its creation.

**Explanation of the Audārika Body:**

The word Audārika is derived from Udāra. The commentator has given three meanings for Udāra:

1. **Udāra** means **principal**. The Audārika body is considered principal in comparison to the bodies of Tirthankaras and Ganadharas. This is because, apart from the Audārika body, all other bodies, even those of the gods in the Uttara Vimāna, are devoid of infinite qualities.
2. **Udāra** means **extensive** or **vast**. The Audārika body is naturally extensive, measuring approximately one thousand yojanas in length. The Vaikriya body, however, does not have such a natural extent. Its maximum extent is five hundred dhanus, and that too only in the seventh hellish earth, not elsewhere. The Uttara Vaikriya body, which can be up to one lakh yojanas in length, is not naturally extensive because it is not permanent throughout the cycle of births and deaths.
3. According to the theoretical definition, **Udāra** means a body composed of flesh, bones, nerves, etc. This Udāra is called Audārika.

**Explanation of the Vaikriya Body:**

1. The Sanskrit equivalent of the Prakrit word **Veunviya** is **Vaikurvika**. The word Vaikurvika is derived from the root **Vikurv**, meaning **to perform various actions**. It refers to a body capable of performing various actions.
2. Alternatively, it refers to **various** or **specific** (unique) actions and reactions. The body that performs actions is called Vaikriya.

**Explanation of the Āhāraka, Tejas, and Karma Bodies:**

The body that is manifested by the power of yoga when a fourteen-fold-equipped monk performs an action is called the **Āhāraka body**.

Page #685:
---------------------------
[Twelfth Body-State] The distortion of Tejas is called the Tejas Body and the body which is the group form of Karma is called the Karma Body or Karmic Body. The reason for this order of the progressively subtle bodies - Audarik, etc. - is their progressive subtlety.

In the twenty-four Dandakavarti beings, the body-formulation is as follows:

902. "O Bhagavan! How many bodies are said to be of the Nairyikas?"
[902 U.] "Gautama! Their three bodies are said to be. They are as follows: Vaikriya, Tejas and Karman bodies."

903. "Similarly, one should understand the body-formulation from the Asura-Kumaras up to the Thanit-Kumaras."

904. "O Bhagavan! How many bodies are said to be of the Prithvi-Kayikas?"
[904 U.] "Gautama! Their three bodies are said to be. They are as follows: Audarik, Tejas and Karman bodies."

905. "Similarly, one should know about the bodies of the Vayu-Kayikas, excluding them, up to the Chaturindriyas."

906. "O Bhagavan! How many bodies are said to be of the Vayu-Kayikas?"

[98] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra [906 v.] Gautama! (Their) four bodies are said. They are as follows: Audārika, Vaikriya, Taijasa and Kārmaṇa bodies / 907. And in the same way, one should understand about the bodies of the Pancendriya-tiryañcaya-yonikas / 608. Bhante! How many bodies are said for humans? Gautama! Five bodies are said for humans. They are as follows: Praudārika, Vaikriya, Pāhārak, Taijasa and Kārmaṇa / 606. The bodies of the Vāṇavyantara, Jyotiṣka and Vaimānika should be described like those of the Nāraka (according to Sūtra 902). Discussion: In the twenty-four Daṇḍaka-varti Jivas, from the Nairyika to the Vaimānika, how many bodies are found in each of the twenty-four Daṇḍakas? This description is presented in these eight Sūtras. The bound and liberated bodies of the five bodies are described in 610. [1] Bhante! How many Audārika bodies are said? Gautama! (They) are said to be of two types, namely: bound and liberated / Of those which are bound (taken by the Jiva), they are countless, from time - they are taken away by countless Utsarpiṇīs-Avasarpiṇīs (time cycles) / From the field - they are countless-world-measure. Of those which are liberated (left behind by the Jiva), they are infinite. From time, they are taken away by infinite Utsarpiṇīs-Avasarpiṇīs / From the field, they are infinite-world-measure / In terms of substance, the liberated Audārika body is infinite times greater than the Abhavasiiddhika (Abhavya) Jivas and is an infinite part of the Siddhas / [2] Bhante! How many Vaikriya bodies are said? Gautama! (They) are said to be of two types, namely: bound and liberated / Of those which are bound, they are countless, from time - they are taken away by countless Utsarpiṇīs-Avasarpiṇīs / From the field - they are countless-world-measure.

---------------------------
The twelfth body is an infinite part of the ladder of bodies. Of those, the liberated ones are infinite, while the bound ones are countless. They are taken away by countless Utsarpini and Avasarpini in time, and they are countless in number in terms of their realm. They are also an infinite part of the infinite number of Pratikrama. As for the liberated ones, they are infinite. They are taken away by infinite Utsarpini and Avasarpini in time, just as it has been said about the liberated ones of the Audarik body, so it should be said about the liberated ones of the Vaikriya body. 

How many types of Aharak bodies are there, Bhagavan? 
Gautama, there are two types of Aharak bodies: bound and liberated. 
Of those, the bound ones are perhaps there, perhaps not. If they are there, they are at least one, two, or three, and at most, they are a thousandfold. 
As for the liberated ones, they are infinite. Just as it has been said about the liberated ones of the Audarik body, so it should be said here. 

How many types of Taijas bodies are there, Bhagavan? 
Gautama, there are two types of Taijas bodies: bound and liberated. 
Of those, the bound ones are infinite. They are taken away by infinite Utsarpini and Avasarpini in time, and they are infinite in number in terms of their realm. They are also infinite times less than the Siddhas in terms of their substance, and they are an infinite part of all living beings. 
As for the liberated ones, they are infinite. They are taken away by infinite Utsarpini and Avasarpini in time, and they are infinite in number in terms of their realm. They are also infinite times more than all living beings in terms of their substance, and they are an infinite part of the class of living beings.

---------------------------
## 100] [ Prajñāpanā Sūtra [5] and Karmagaśarīra Vi Bhāṇiyavvā / [910-5] In the same way, it should be said about the karmic body. 

**Discussion of the five bound-liberated bodies** - This sūtra (910-1 to 5) presents the quantity of the five bodies, both bound and liberated, in relation to substance, space, and time. 

**Definition of bound and liberated** - The bodies that are grasped (taken) by the living beings are called bound bodies, and the bodies that the living beings have grasped and abandoned in their past lives are called liberated bodies. 

**Quantity of bound-liberated bodies** - The scholars have considered the quantity of the bound and liberated forms of the five bodies in relation to substance, space, and time. In relation to substance, it is from the non-manifest (abhavya) etc., in relation to space, it is from the series (śreṇi), the other (pratar) etc., and in relation to time, it is by the beginning (āvalika) etc. 

**Quantity of bound and liberated audārika bodies** - Bound audārika bodies are innumerable. Although the living beings who hold the bound audārika bodies are infinite, the reason why the quantity of bound audārika bodies is said to be innumerable is this: the living beings who hold audārika bodies are of two types - each-bodied (pratyekasārīrī) and infinite-bodied (anantakāyika). 

Each-bodied living beings have separate audārika bodies, but those who are infinite-bodied do not have separate audārika bodies, they have only one for infinite-infinite living beings. Therefore, even though the audārika-bodied living beings are infinite-infinite, their bodies are only innumerable. 

**In relation to time** - Bound audārika bodies are taken away in innumerable ascending (utsarpiṇī) and innumerable descending (avasarpiṇī) periods. This means that if one audārika body is taken away in each period of ascending and descending time, then innumerable ascending and descending periods would pass in taking away all the audārika bodies. 

**In relation to space** - Bound audārika bodies are as numerous as innumerable worlds. This means that if all the bound audārika bodies are placed in separate spaces in the sky in their own form (pṛthak-pṛthak) from their own comprehension, then the sky of innumerable worlds would be filled with those separately placed bodies. 

**Liberated audārika bodies** are infinite. Their quantity is equal to the time of taking away infinite ascending and descending periods. That is, if one liberated audārika body is taken away in each period of ascending and descending time, then infinite ascending and descending periods would end in taking away all the liberated audārika bodies. In short, it can be said that the number of liberated audārika bodies is equal to the number of periods in infinite ascending and descending periods. 

**In relation to space** - They are as numerous as infinite worlds. This means that there are innumerable regions in one world. There are as many liberated audārika bodies as there are regions in the sky of such infinite worlds. 

**In relation to substance** - Liberated audārika bodies are infinite times greater than the non-manifest (abhavya) living beings, but they are only an infinite part of the perfected (siddh) living beings. That is, they are not equal to the number of perfected living beings. 

**A doubt in this regard** - If this number of liberated audārika bodies is considered to be unchanged (as it is), then they cannot be infinite, because according to the rule, the state of the particles (pudgala) is at most for an innumerable period of time, so these liberated bodies cannot remain unchanged for an infinite period of time.

Page #689:
---------------------------
## Twelfth Body Chapter [101]

If we consider the pudgalas that a living being has taken and discarded as an audaric body in the past, then all living beings have taken and discarded all pudgalas as audaric bodies, leaving no pudgalas remaining. In such a situation, how can the statement that liberated audaric bodies are infinite times greater than the avyavayas and are an infinite part of the Siddha beings be consistent?

The solution is that here, liberated audaric bodies do not include only the avikal (undivided) bodies, nor do they include the pudgalas that were taken and discarded as audaric bodies. Therefore, the aforementioned objection is not valid.

The audaric body that a living being has taken and discarded is destroyed and has infinite divisions. These audaric pudgalas, while acquiring infinite divisions, are called audaric bodies until they abandon the audaric paryaya. The pudgalas that have abandoned the audaric paryaya are not called audaric bodies. Thus, infinite bodies are possible from a single body. In this way, since each body has infinite-infinite divisions, abundant infinite bodies are found at the same time. They exist for an immeasurable period of time. In that immeasurable period, there are also other immeasurable bodies discarded by living beings. Each of them also has infinite-infinite divisions. Those among them that abandon the audaric body paryaya in that period are not counted among these, the rest are counted among the audaric bodies. Therefore, the quantity of liberated audaric bodies mentioned above becomes consistent.

Just as the salt that has transformed into salt result is considered salt, whether it is little or much, similarly, the audaric pudgala-samghata that has transformed into audaric form, whether it is little (half, a quarter, or even a country) or much (a complete audaric body), is also called an audaric body. Even an infinite part of the body is called a body.

Now the question is, how can infinite-infinite loka-akasha-pradesh-sized audaric bodies reside (be contained) in a single loka? The solution is that they are contained in a single loka like the light of a lamp. Just as the light of a lamp pervades the entire building and the light of many other lamps can also exist in that building without conflict, similarly, infinite-infinite liberated audaric bodies reside in a single loka-akasha.

The quantity of bound-liberated kriya-bodies: Bound vakriya bodies are immeasurable. If we take away one vakriya body at each moment of the utsarpini and avasarpini kalas, then immeasurable utsarpini and avasarpini kalas will pass in taking away all the vakriya bodies. In short, it can be said that there are as many bound vakriya bodies as there are moments in immeasurable utsarpini and avasarpini kalas.

With respect to the field, bound vakriya bodies are immeasurable-series-sized, and the quantity of those series is an immeasurable part of the pratar. This means that there are as many bound vakriya bodies as there are series in an immeasurable part of the pratar, and as many akasha-pradeshas are in those series.

The quantity of the series is as follows: The ghanikrit loka is 7 rajju-sized on all sides. Such lokas...

Page #690:
---------------------------
[102] | A row of seven *rajjus* in length and a *muktavali* is called a *pradesh* of the sky. The dense *loka* is seven *rajjus* in size, as follows: The entire *loka* is fourteen *rajjus* from top to bottom. Its extent is seven *rajjus* less at the bottom / there is one *rajju* in the middle. In the very middle of the fifth *devaloka* called *Brahmaloka*, there are five *rajjus*, and the *loka* ends at an extent of one *rajju* above / the size of the *rajju* should be understood from the end of the platform on the eastern shore of the *svayambhuramanasamudra* to the end of its outer platform. The shape of the *loka* with this length and breadth is like a man dancing with both hands on his waist. With this imagination, the lower *loka* section on the south side of the *trasanadi* (which is a little less than three *rajjus* in extent and a little more than seven *rajjus* high) should be gathered together from the north side of the *sananadi*, with the upper part below and the lower part above. Then, in the upper *loka*, the two sections shaped like the elbow (on the south side of the *trasanadi*) which are each a little less than three and a half *rajjus* high, should be gathered together on the north side in the imagination. By doing this, the lower half of the *loka* becomes a little less than four *rajjus* wide and the upper half becomes three *rajjus* wide and a little less than seven *rajjus* high. Then, the upper half should be placed on the north side of the lower half in the imagination. By doing this, a cube becomes a little more than seven *rajjus* high and a little less than seven *rajjus* wide / what is more than seven *rajjus* above is joined to the north side of the upper and lower rectangular (long) parts / this makes the width also a full seven *rajjus*. In this way, the *loka* is densified. Wherever the density does not reach seven *rajjus*, it should be filled in by imagination. Wherever a *shreni* or *pratar* is taken in the *siddhant* (scripture), it should be understood as the densified seven *rajjus* *loka* *shreni* or *pratar* in the same way. The liberated *vaikriya* bodies are also infinite like the liberated *audarika* bodies. Therefore, their infinity should also be understood like the aforementioned liberated *audarikas* / the size of the bound-liberated *aharaka* bodies - bound *aharaka* bodies may or may not exist, because the interval (absence) of the *aharaka* body is as short as one moment and as long as six months. If *aharaka* bodies exist, their number is as low as one, two, or three, and as high as *sahasraprithaktva*, that is, from two thousand to nine thousand. The size of the liberated *aharaka* bodies should be understood like the liberated *audarika* bodies. The size of the bound-liberated *tejas* bodies - bound *tejas* bodies are infinite. Because the *tejas* bodies of ordinary *nigod* living beings are different, not one like the *audarikas* / its infinity is measured in time (as before) equal to the times of infinite *utsapinis* and *avasapinis*. In terms of space - it is infinite *loka* measure. That is, there are as many bound *tejas* bodies as there are regions in infinite *loka* skies. In relation to substance, bound *tejas* bodies are infinite times more than the *siddhas*, because *tejas* bodies are of all worldly living beings, and worldly living beings are infinite times more than the *siddhas* / therefore, *tejas* bodies are also 1. *Paharagai loe chhammase ja na hoti vi kyaaee / Ukkose nanam niyama, ek samayan jahanan //* - *Prajnapanam*.

[Twelfth Body-State] [103 Siddhas have infinite merits. But from the perspective of the entire living beings, they are less than an infinite part of all living beings, because Siddhas do not have a Tejas body and Siddhas are an infinite part of all living beings, therefore, by reducing them, the Tejas body became less than an infinite part of all living beings. Liberated Tejas bodies are also infinite. In relation to time and space, its infinity should be understood as before. In relation to substance, liberated Tejas bodies are infinitely more than all living beings, because each living being has one Tejas body. When they are abandoned by living beings, they become infinitely different in the aforementioned way and they remain in that state for an immeasurable period of time, in that time, countless other Tejas bodies abandoned (liberated) by living beings are found, and they all become infinitely different in the aforementioned way / Therefore, the number of all of them is said to be infinitely more than all living beings.  Is the number of all liberated Tejas bodies equal to the number of living beings? Resolving this doubt, the scholars say that they are equal to an infinite part of the number of living beings. They would be equal to the number of living beings only if the Tejas body of each living being were equal to the number of all living beings, or slightly more; and with that, the infinite part of the Siddha beings would be fulfilled / Multiplication of the same quantity by the same quantity results in a square. For example, multiplying 4 by 4 (44 4 = 16) results in a square with sixteen numbers. But the liberated Tejas body of each living being cannot be equal to the number of all living beings, or slightly more, but it is much less than that, and they also remain for an immeasurable period of time. In that time, the other liberated Tejas bodies that exist are also few, because the time is short. For this reason, liberated Tejas bodies are not equal to the number of living beings, but are only an infinite part of the number of living beings. The quantity of bound-liberated Karman bodies should also be understood in the same way as the Tejas bodies. Because the number of Tejas and Karman bodies is the same.'

[104] [The Prajñāpanā Sūtra has spoken about the bodies, in the same way (here, about the liberated Audārika bodies of the Nairyāyikas) it should be said. [2] "Reverend Sir! How many are the Vaikriya bodies of the Nairyāyikas?" "Gautama! They are said to be of two kinds.

Discussion: The description of the five bound and liberated bodies of the Nairyāyikas - This Sūtra (Su. 611-1 to 4) describes the size of the five bound and liberated bodies of the Nairyāyikas. Description of the bound and liberated Audārika bodies of the Nairyāyikas - There are no bound Audārika bodies of the Nairyāyikas, because an Audārika body is not possible for them from birth. Their liberated Audārika bodies should be understood to be the same as the previously mentioned liberated Audārika bodies.

## Twelfth Body-State] [105 Narakas]

The bound Vaikriya bodies of the 105 Narakas are equal in number to the Nairyikas, as each Naraka has one bound Vaikriya body. Since the number of Naraka beings is innumerable, the number of their bound Vaikriya bodies is also innumerable. Describing this innumerability through time and space, the scriptural scholars say:

**In terms of time:** If one body is taken away at each moment in both the Utsarpini and Avasarpini kalpas, then all the bodies of the innumerable Utsarpini and Avasarpini beings are taken away. In other words, the number of bound Vaikriya bodies of Narakas is equal to the number of moments in the innumerable Utsarpini and Avasarpini kalpas.

**In terms of space:** They are as numerous as the innumerable श्रेणियाँ (Shreṇīs). And an innumerable part of a प्रतर (Pratar) is called a श्रेणी (Shreṇī). The number of bound Vaikriya bodies of Narakas is equal to the number of celestial regions in these innumerable श्रेणियाँ (Shreṇīs).

Now the question arises: If there are innumerable श्रेणियाँ (Shreṇīs) in the entire प्रतर (Pratar), in half of the प्रतर (Pratar), in one-third of the प्रतर (Pratar), and so on, then how many श्रेणियाँ (Shreṇīs) should be considered here? To resolve this curiosity, the Bhulpaṭha says: "An innumerable part of the प्रतर (Pratar)." This means that the number of श्रेणियाँ (Shreṇīs) to be considered here is equal to the number of श्रेणियाँ (Shreṇīs) in an innumerable part of the प्रतर (Pratar).

Then, to specify their particular size, it is said that the list of the विष्कम्भ (Vishkambha) of those श्रेणियाँ (Shreṇīs), i.e., the list of their extent, is as follows:

A श्रेणी (Shreṇī) of one प्रदेश (Pradesha) is equal to the quantity obtained by multiplying the first square root of an angula by its second square root. The meaning is that there are innumerable square roots of the number of प्रदेश (Pradeshas) in a region of one angula measure. For example, the square root of the first square root is the second square root, the square root of the second square root is the third square root, and so on, there are innumerable square roots in succession. Therefore, in the present context, one should imagine a list of as many प्रदेश (Pradeshas) as are obtained by multiplying the first square root by the second square root. Then, extend it lengthwise in the south-north direction. The number of श्रेणियाँ (Shreṇīs) that this established list touches should be considered here.

For example, although there are innumerable प्रदेश (Pradeshas) in a region of one angula measure, let us assume it to be 256 for the sake of calculation. The first square root of this number 256 is sixteen (245=10+6=16). The second square root is 4, and the third square root is 2. Of these, multiplying the second square root, which is four, by the first square root, which is sixteen, gives us 64. So, we should consider only this many श्रेणियाँ (Shreṇīs).

The scriptural scholars say the same thing in another way: "Or, one should consider श्रेणियाँ (Shreṇīs) equal to the cube of the second square root of an angula." This means that one should consider श्रेणियाँ (Shreṇīs) equal to the cube of the second square root, i.e., four, of the number of प्रदेश (Pradeshas) in a region of one angula measure. The cube of a quantity is obtained by multiplying its square by the same quantity. For example, the cube of two is eight. It is as follows: The square of the quantity two is four, multiplying this (four) by two gives us the number eight. Therefore, the cube of the quantity two is eight. Similarly, here also, the square of the quantity four (4) is sixteen, multiplying this (sixteen) by the quantity four gives us the cube of four, which is sixty-four (64). Thus, there is no real difference between these two methods. Here, the वृत्तिकार (Vṛttikāra) gives a third...

[106] The *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* also states: The number of regions in a space of an angula measure, when multiplied by its square root, is equal to the number of *sucas* of that measure. The number of *sucas* is equal to the number of categories they touch. The number of categories is equal to the number of celestial regions. The number of *nārakas* with bound *vaikriya* bodies is equal to the number of celestial regions. The form of the liberated *vaikriya* bodies of *nārakas* should be understood as being the same as their liberated *audārika* bodies. The bound and liberated *āhārika* bodies of *nārakas* should be understood in the same way as their bound *audārika* bodies. *Nārakas* do not have bound *pāhārika* bodies, because the capacity for *āhārakala* is not possible for them. The *āhārika* body is only found in the fourteen *pūrva-dhārī* monks who have attained *āhārakala*. The liberated *āhārika* bodies of *nairāyikas* should be understood in the same way as before.

[612] [1] "Venerable one, how many *praudārika* bodies are there for the *asura-kumāras*?" "Gautama, just as it has been said about the *nairāyikas* (bound and liberated) *audārika* bodies (in Sūtra 611 [1]), so it should be said about these (the *asura-kumāras* bound and liberated *audārika* bodies)." [612-1] "Venerable one, how many *vaikriya* bodies are there for the *asura-kumāras*?" "Gautama, they are said to be of two types: bound and liberated. Of those that are bound, they are innumerable. In terms of time, they are carried away in innumerable *utsapiṇīs* and *avasapiṇīs*. In terms of space, there are innumerable categories. These categories are an innumerable part of the *pratar*. The diameter of these categories is an innumerable part of the square root of an angula. Of those that are liberated (the *asura-kumāras* liberated *vaikriya* bodies), it should be said in the same way as it has been said about the liberated *audārika* bodies (in Sūtra 610 [1])."

[Twelfth Body-Chapter] [107 [3] Regarding the Audaric body, it should be understood in the same way as the two types of Audaric bodies (bound-liberated) of these (Naryikas). [612-3] (Their) (bound-liberated) Audaric bodies should be understood in the same way as the two types of Audaric bodies (bound-liberated) of these (Naryikas). [4] Similarly, the two types of Tejas and Karman bodies (bound-liberated) should be understood in the same way as the Vaikriya bodies (bound-liberated) of these (Naryikas). [912-4] (Their bound-liberated) two types of Tejas and Karman bodies (statement) should also be understood in the same way as the Vaikriya bodies (bound-liberated) of these (Naryikas). / 613. And so on until the Stanitkumara. [613] All the bound-liberated bodies up to the Stanitkumara should be understood in the same way. Discussion - The bound-liberated bodies of the Asurakumara etc. - The present two sutras (Su. 912-613) describe the bound and liberated Audaric etc. five bodies of the ten Bhavanapatidevas from Asurakumara to Stanitkumara. / The bound-liberated Audaric body of the Asurakumara - They do not have a bound Audaric body because, like the Narakas, their Bhavasvabhava is an obstacle in this. / Their liberated Audaric body should be understood like the Naryikas. Description of the bound-liberated Vaikriya bodies of the Asurakumara - Their bound Vaikriya bodies are innumerable, equal to the innumerable number of Asurakumara Devas. In terms of time, they are equal to the innumerable Utsapini and Avapini times. In terms of space, they are innumerable series in measure. There are as many bound Vaikriya bodies as there are space regions in innumerable series. Those series are innumerable parts in measure. / Here, the Shastrakar, while describing the measure in particular, compared to the Narakas, says that the Vishkambhasuchi for the measure of those series is the number of parts of the space region of the first square root of the measure of the space region of an Angula. For example, by assumption, the measure of the space region of an Angula is considered to be 256. Its first square root is considered to be 16. The Vishkambhasuchi for the measure of the series should be understood as the number of space regions in its number of parts, which is five or six by assumption. From this perspective, the Vishkambhasuchi of the Asurakumara Devas is innumerable times less than that of the Naryikas, because the Vishkambhasuchi for the measure of the series of the Narakas is the number of space regions that are the first square root multiplied by the second square root. / In fact, the second square root is innumerable space regions. / Therefore, the measure of the Narakas is the number of space regions of the first square root multiplied by innumerable, while the Vishkambhasuchi of the Asurakumara etc. is only the number of parts of the first square root of an Angula. This is also logical. Because, even in the Mahadantaka, all the Bhavanavasis are called innumerable Gugahan of the Ratnapraba earth, the Narpika 4. From this perspective, their innumerability compared to all the Narakas is self-evident. Their liberated Vaikriya bodies should be understood in the same way as the liberated Vaikriya bodies of the Audhika. /

[108] The form of the *praharak* bodies of these bound-liberated *praharak-tejaskarma* bodies should be understood like the *nairyikas*, the form of the bound *tejaskarma* bodies should be understood like the bound *vaikriya* bodies, and the form of their liberated *tejaskarma* bodies should be understood like the liberated *tejaskarma* of the *audik*s. The form of the bound-liberated bodies of the *ekendriya*s should be understood as follows:

[1] "Bhagavan! How many *oudarik* bodies are there for the *prithvikaayikas*?" "Gautama! They are said to be of two types: bound and liberated. Of those, the bound are countless. In terms of time, they are taken away by countless *utsarpini*s and *avsarpinis*. In terms of space, they are countless *lokas*. Of those, the liberated are infinite. In terms of time, they are taken away by infinite *utsarpini*s and *avsarpinis*. In terms of space, they are infinite *lokas*. In terms of substance, they are infinite times greater than the *abhavya*s, and they are an infinite part of the *siddhas*."

[2] "Bhagavan! How many *vaikriya* bodies are there for the *prithvikaayikas*?" "Gautama! They are said to be of two types: bound and liberated. Of those, the bound are not there. Of those, the liberated should be understood in the same way as the *oudarik* bodies of these."

[3] "And so it is with the *praharak* bodies."

[4] "The *tejaskarma* bodies (of these bound-liberated) should be understood like the bound-liberated *oudarik* bodies of these."

**[110] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra Vivēcana -  Description of the Bound and Liberated Audārika, etc. Bodies of the Ekendriya (Single-Sensed) Beings] - The four sūtras presented here (Sū. 914 to 917) describe the bound and liberated Audārika, etc. bodies of the Earth-bodied, etc. Ekendriya beings. The bound Audārika bodies of the Earth-bodied, etc. are innumerable. They are equal to the innumerable times of the Utsapiṇī and Avasapiṇī periods in terms of time, and are innumerable Lokapramāṇa in terms of space. In this regard, the reasoning should be understood as before! Their liberated Audārika bodies should be understood as being similar to the liberated Audārika bodies.  **

**Description of the Vaikriya, Mahārak, Tejas, and Kārmaṇa Bodies of the Earth-bodied, etc. -** Since they lack Vaikriya-labdhi and Āhāra-labdhi, they do not have bound Vaikriya and Āhāraka bodies. The statement of liberated Āhāraka and Vaikriya bodies should be understood as being similar to the liberated Audārika bodies. Their Tejas and Kārmaṇa bodies should be understood as being similar to their bound and liberated Audārika bodies. 

**Description of the Five Bodies of the Air-bodied Beings -** The bound and liberated Audārika bodies of the Air-bodied beings should be understood as being similar to the bound and liberated Audārika bodies of the Earth-bodied beings. The Air-bodied beings have a Vaikriya body, therefore, the bound Vaikriya bodies of the Air-bodied beings are innumerable. If one Vaikriya body is removed every moment, then in an innumerable part of a Palyopam, they will be completely removed. This means that the number of bound Vaikriya bodies of the Air-bodied beings is equal to the number of moments in an innumerable part of a Palyopam. There are two divisions of Air-bodied beings: Sūkṣma (subtle) and Bādar (dense), and each of these has two further divisions: Paryāpta (sufficient) and Aparyāpta (insufficient). Of these, the Bādar Paryāpta Air-bodied beings are innumerable parts of a Lokākāśa, while the remaining three are innumerable Lokākāśa-pramaṇa. Of these three types of Air-bodied beings, Vaikriya-labdhi does not occur, and only a limited number of Bādar Air-bodied beings have Vaikriya-labdhi. This is because only a limited number of beings with Vaikriya bodies are found at the time of Prīcchā (inquiry) in an innumerable part of a Palyopam. Therefore, only these have a Vaikriya body, not the other three. Regarding the liberated Vaikriya body of the Air-bodied beings, it should be said as being similar to the liberated Vaikriya body. Their bound Tejas and Kārmaṇa bodies should be understood as being similar to the bound Audārika body, and their liberated Tejas and Kārmaṇa bodies should be understood as being similar to the liberated Audārika Tejas and Kārmaṇa bodies. Since the Air-bodied beings lack Āhāra-labdhi, they only have infinite liberated Āhāraka bodies, not bound ones. 

**Description of the Five Bodies of the Plant-bodied Beings -** The statement of the bound and liberated Audārika bodies of the Plant-bodied beings should be understood as being similar to the bound and liberated Audārika bodies of the Earth-bodied beings. The bound and liberated Tejas and Kārmaṇa bodies should be understood as being similar to the Audārika Tejas and Kārmaṇa bodies. Their Vaikriya and Āhāraka bodies are only liberated, not bound, because they do not have Vaikriya-labdhi and Āhāra-labdhi.

[Twelfth Sharirpad] 113 In the Utsarpini-Avasarpini periods, they complete the entire Pratar. According to the extent of the region and time, the measure is in the form of a series of Angulimatra Pratar, which is a part of the innumerable part-fraction of the Pratar. From the perspective of the region, it is measured, and from the perspective of time, it is subtracted from the innumerable part-fraction of the Avalika, that is, from the innumerable part-fraction. The implication is that a Dwindriya takes away a part-fraction the size of the innumerable part of an Angula from the innumerable part-fraction of the Avalika. The second Dwindriya also takes away a part-fraction of the same measure in the same time. In this way, the Pratar that is taken away is completely taken away by all the Dwindriyas in the innumerable Utsarpini-Avasarpini periods.

The description of the free Audārika bodies of the Dwindriyas should be understood as similar to the collection of free Audārika bodies. The description of the bound-free Kriya, Prāhārika, Taijasa-Kārmaṇa bodies of the Dwindriyas - the bound Vaikriya and Āhārika bodies of the Dwindriyas are not. The description of the free Vaikriya and Āhārika bodies should be understood as similar to the collection of free Audārika bodies. The description of their bound-free Taijasa-Kārmaṇa bodies should be known in the same way as their bound-free Audārika bodies.

The description of the bound-free Paudgalika etc. bodies of the Trindriyas and Chaturindriyas should be done in the same way as the bound-free bodies of the Dwindriyas. The description of the bound-free bodies of the Pañcendriya-Tiryañchas should be understood in the same way as the description of the bound-free Praudārika bodies of the Pañcendriya-Tiryañchas!

The bound Vaikriya bodies are innumerable. The description of all the measures according to time and space should be understood as similar to the Asuraku māras, but the specialty is that in the statement of the Asuraku māras, the measure of the series of Vishkambha was stated as the innumerable part of the first square root of an Angula, whereas here the innumerable part should be understood.

The implication is that in the collection of the regions of an Angulimatra area, there are as many Ākāsha-Pradeśas as there are in the innumerable part of the first square root, and in the series of those Pradeśa-form rows, there are as many Ākāsha-Pradeśas as there are Bound Vaikriya bodies of the Pañcendriya-Tiryañchas. The description of their free Vaikriya bodies should be understood as similar to the collection of Praudhika Vaikriya bodies. They do not have bound Āhārika bodies. The description of the free Āhārika body should be understood as before. Their bound Taijasa-Kārmaṇa bodies are like their bound Praudārika bodies. The free Taijasa-Kārmaṇa body should be understood as similar to the collection of free Taijasa-Kārmaṇa bodies.

## Twelfth Body-State ] [ 115 Discussion - The quantity of bound and liberated Audārika etc. bodies of humans is presented in the Sutra (921-1-4)

The Sutra (921-1-4) describes the five bodies of humans, both bound and liberated, including the Audārika body. Bound and liberated bodies of humans are described as follows:

Bound Audārika bodies of humans are sometimes countable and sometimes uncountable. This means that humans are of two types - Garbhaja and Sammūcchima. Garbhaja humans (by their very nature) are always permanent. There is no time that is devoid of Garbhaja humans. However, Sammūcchima humans exist sometimes, and sometimes they are completely absent. This is because the lifespan of Sammūcchima humans is at most an Antarmuhūrta (a very short period of time). The interval between their births (the time of their absence) is said to be at most twenty-four Muhūrtas (a Muhūrta is a period of 48 minutes).

Therefore, during the time when Sammūcchima humans are completely absent, and only Garbhaja humans exist, the bound Audārika bodies are countable, because the number of Garbhaja humans is countable. They are finite in extent, being either in the form of a Mahāśarīra (a large body) or in the form of each individual body. When Sammūcchima humans exist, the number of humans becomes uncountable. Sammūcchima humans are, at most, as numerous as the number of regions of space in the uncountable part of the highest category.

In this regard, the original text states: "In the lowest category, they are countable." The lowest category refers to the place where the fewest humans are found. The question arises: Are these (the fewest humans) Sammūcchima or Garbhaja? The answer is that they are Garbhaja humans, who, being always permanent, are the fewest in the absence of Sammūcchima humans. In the highest category, both Garbhaja and Sammūcchima humans are included.

Here, the lowest category refers to countable humans. However, there are different types of countable numbers, so simply saying "countable" does not convey the specific number. Therefore, the scholars determine a specific number: the countable number is Koṭikoṭi (a very large number). To make this quantity even clearer, it is said: "Above three Yamalapas and below four Yamalapas." This means that the number of humans is represented by twenty-nine (29) digits, which will be explained further. According to the scholarly definition, a group of eight digits is called a "Yamalapada." Therefore, there are three Yamalapas of twenty-four (24) digits. After that (after 24 digits), five digit places remain. However, the fourth Yamalapada is completed with eight digits, leaving three digit places empty. Therefore, the fourth Yamalapada is not complete. For this reason, it is said here for the number of humans represented by 26 digits: "Above three Yamalapas and below four Yamalapas," meaning 29 digits.

Alternatively, two squares together make one Yamalapada. Four squares together make two Yamalapas, six squares together make three Yamalapas, and eight squares together make four Yamalapas. Therefore, saying "above six squares and below the seventh square" is the same as saying "above three Yamalapas and below four Yamalapas."

Now, the number of humans is explained even more clearly: The quantity that results from multiplying the fifth square by the sixth square is the number of humans in the lowest category. When one is multiplied by one, the product is one, and there is no increase in the number. Therefore, "one" is not counted as a square. However, when two is multiplied by two, the number 4 is obtained, which is the first square. When four is multiplied by four, the number 16 is obtained, which is the second square.

Page #704:
---------------------------
116 [ This second square is obtained from the Prajnapana, then multiplying 16 by 16, the number 256 is obtained, this is the third square / Multiplying 256 by 256, the amount 65536 is obtained, this is the fourth square. Multiplying the amount of this fourth square again by the same amount, the number 4294667296 is obtained / This is the fifth square. Multiplying the amount of the fifth square, 'four hundred twenty-nine crore, forty-two lakh, sixty-six thousand two hundred ninety-six' by the same amount, the amount 18446744073709551616 is obtained. This is the sixth square. ' Multiplying this sixth square by the aforementioned fifth square, the amount that is obtained, there are that many humans in the Jghanya-pada / This amount is as follows in the aforementioned 29 (twenty-nine) digits - 79228162514264337593543950336 - these twenty-nine digits cannot be expressed in any way by using Koti, Koti-koti, etc. / In the Anuyogadwaravritti (according to the principle of counting digits in reverse order), this number is described in two stanzas / Or, the ancient teachers have described this same number in one stanza by taking the first letter of the digits in reverse order. Now, to explain this same number in another way, the Shastrakar says / 'Mahb Gan Chhannauicheyan Gadayi Raso' The explanation of the amount of Chhayanawe Chhedanakadayi is as follows - the one who, by repeatedly dividing in half, reaches the Chhayanawe division, and one remains in the end; that is called the Chhayanawe Chhedanakadayi amount. This amount is the same as the amount obtained by multiplying the fifth square by the sixth square. That number is as follows: If the first (aforementioned) square is divided, it gives two Chhedanakas, the first Chhedanak is two and the second Chhedanak is one / Combining both, there are two Chhedanakas / Similarly, the second square has four Chhedanakas. Because it is the number 16 / Its first Chhedanak is 8, the second is 4, the third is 2 and 1. Chattari Ya Kodisaya Aunatisan Cha Hoti Kodyo.

## Twelfth Sharourpad

**117 is the fourth square with one Chedanak / The third square is of the number 256. Therefore, it has 8 Chedanaks. Similarly, the fourth square has 16 Chedanaks, the fifth square has 32 Chedanaks, and the sixth square has 64 Chedanaks / Thus, adding all the Chedanaks, there are a total of 66 Chedanaks, which is the product of the fifth square and the sixth square. In whichever square the multiplication is done with whichever square, that square contains the Chedanaks of both the multiplier and the multiplicand. For example, multiplying the first square with the second square results in six Chedanaks / Multiplying the second square of the number 16 with the first square of the number 4 (16 x 4 x 4 = 64) results in the number 64 / Its first Chedanak is 32, the second Chedanak is 16, the third Chedanak is 8, the fourth Chedanak is 4, the fifth Chedanak is 2, and the sixth Chedanak is 1 / Thus, there are 6 Chedanaks / Similarly, one should understand it everywhere / Similarly, multiplying the fifth square with the sixth square results in 96 Bhang, this is proven / Or, by establishing one digit and doubling it 96 times, if the same amount is obtained, then that amount is called the 96 Chedanak amount. This is said to be the number of humans in the Jghanya-pad. The number of humans in the Utkrishta-pad is as follows: The number of humans in the Utkrishta-pad is countless. In relation to time - if one human body is taken away at a time, then in countless Utsarpini-Avasarpini kalas, it is completely taken away. In relation to space - by projecting one form, a complete category of humans is taken away. This means that if one is added to the countless humans in the Utkrishta-pad, a complete category is taken away. The path of taking away that category from space and time is as follows: Time-wise - countless humans are taken away in countless Utsarpini-Avasarpini kalas / Space-wise - they are the first square root-proof multiplied by the third square root of an angul. The amount of space in angul-proof regions is 256, whose first square root is 16. Multiplying it by the third square root of two, the amount of regions (16 x 4 x 2 = 32) becomes 32. The category taken away from these many sections reaches completeness, and this is the ultimate number of humans. The question is - how do countless Utsarpini-Avasarpini kalas pass in taking away one category from the sections with the above proof? The solution is as follows: The space is extremely subtle / It is also said - time is subtle. Space is even more subtle than that; because countless Utsarpini kalas fit into the angul-proof categories. ' That is - the amount of space in an angul-proof area is greater than the time of countless Utsarpini kalas. The representation of the liberated generous bodies of humans should be understood as the same as the collection of liberated generous bodies. The representation of the bound-liberated Vaikriya-sharira etc. of humans is countable, because Vaikriya-labdhi is possible only in the womb-born humans, and that too in some, not in all. 1.

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The Pragyapana Sutra states that the description of the liberated vaikriya bodies should be understood in the same way as the description of the liberated audika vaikriya bodies. The description of the bound and liberated aharika bodies of humans should be understood in the same way as the description of the bound and liberated audika aharika bodies. The taijaса and karmana bodies of humans should be understood in the same way as their own bound saudārika bodies. The description of the liberated taijaса and karmana bodies should be done in the same way as the description of the liberated audika taijaса and karmana bodies.

The description of the bound and liberated audārika and other bodies of the Vānamantara, Jyotiṣka, and Vaimānika devas should be understood in the same way as the description of the bound and liberated praudarika and prāhārika bodies of the Nārakayas. The description of their vaikriya bodies is the same as that of the Nārakayas. The specialty is that the list of the number of their series (śreṇī) is a countable fraction of the unit of measurement (yojana-śata-varga-pratiblāga) in the completion and removal of the viṣkambha. The description of their liberated vaikriya bodies should be understood in the same way as the description of the liberated audārika bodies.

The description of the Jyotiṣka devas is the same, except that the list of the number of their series (śreṇī) is two hundred and fifty-six unit fractions (aṅgula-śata-varga-pratiblāga) in the completion and removal of the viṣkambha.

The description of the Vaimānika devas is also the same, except that the list of the number of their series (śreṇī) is the square root of the third unit (aṅgula-tṛtīya-varga-mūla) or the cube of the third unit (aṅgula-tṛtīya-varga-mūla-ghana-pramāṇa) in the completion and removal of the viṣkambha.

This completes the twelfth chapter on the topic of bodies in the Bhagavati Prajñāpanā.

## Twelfth Body Stage [119]

There are as many categories as the cube of the cube root of an angul, or they are equal to the cube of the cube root of an angul. / The rest should be understood in the same way as the previous statement.

**Discussion of the Forms of the Bound and Liberated Bodies of the Vaṇavyantara, Jyotiṣka, and Vaimānika Devas**

The three sūtras (922 to 624) present the forms of the bound and liberated bodies of the Vaṇavyantara, Jyotiṣka, and Vaimānika Devas, respectively.

**Forms of the Bound and Liberated Bodies of the Vaṇavyantara Devas**

The bound and liberated Audārika bodies of the Vaṇavyantara Devas should be understood in the same way as the bound and liberated Audārika bodies of the Nārayikas. / The bound Vaikriya bodies of the Vaṇavyantara are innumerable, like those of the Nārakas. With respect to time, the removal of one body at a time in each of the innumerable Utsarpini and Avasarpini kalas results in the removal of all the bound Vaikriya bodies of the Vaṇavyantara. With respect to space, they are innumerable categories in number. / That is, there are as many bodies as there are spaces in the sky in innumerable categories. These categories are innumerable parts of the Prati. / There is only a slight difference in their list. The list of the diameters of these innumerable categories is as follows. Just as the Vaṇavyantara Devas are said to be innumerable times less than the five-sensed Tiryañca Nāpusakas in the Mahāḍaṇḍaka, so also their (the Vaṇavyantara Devas) list of diameters should be said to be innumerable times less than the list of diameters of the five-sensed Tiryañcas. In the filling and removal of the Prati, that list is equal to the number of squares of hundreds of yojanas. / The meaning is that if one Vaṇavyantara is placed in each category section of innumerable squares of hundreds of yojanas, then they fill the entire Prati. / Or, if one category section of innumerable squares of hundreds of yojanas is removed with the removal of each Vaṇavyantara, then all of them together are complete. Beyond that is the entire Prati.

The statement about the liberated Vaikriya bodies of the Vaṇavyantara should be understood as the liberated Audhika Vaikriya bodies. The statement about the bound and liberated Āhārika bodies should be understood as the bound and liberated Āhārika bodies of the Nārayikas. The statement about their bound Taijasa-Kārmaṇa bodies should be understood as their bound Vaikriya bodies. With respect to the liberated Taijasa-Kārmaṇa bodies, they should be understood as the liberated Audhika Taijasa-Kārmaṇa bodies.

**Forms of the Bound and Liberated Bodies of the Jyotiṣka Devas**

The statement about their bound and liberated Audārika bodies should be understood as the Nārayikas. The bound Vaikriya bodies are innumerable. With respect to time, their complete removal occurs in innumerable Utsarpini and Avasarpini kalas due to the removal of one body at a time in each of the innumerable kalas. With respect to space, they are innumerable categories. These categories should be known as innumerable parts of the Prati. The special thing is that the list of diameters of those categories is innumerable times greater than the list of diameters of the Vaṇavyantara, because the Jyotiṣka Devas are said to be innumerable times greater than the Vaṇavyantara in the Mahāḍaṇḍaka. Therefore, with respect to the parts, it is also clearly stated that the list of diameters of those categories should be known as 256 square sections of the Prati in the filling and removal. / The meaning is that if one Jyotiṣka is placed in each category section of 256 angul squares, then they are able to fill the entire Prati. / Or, if one Jyotiṣka is removed, then one section of 256 angul squares is removed.

On the other hand, the Sakala Pratara is complete / The liberated Vaikriya bodies of the Jyotishkas are like a liberated collection, and the Aharaka body is like a Naraka / The rest should be understood as before / The Vaimanikas have an infinite number of series of Vaikriya body sizes / That is, there are as many bodies as there are spaces in the infinite series / The size of these series is an infinite part of the Pratara, but there is some difference in the size of the infinite part of the Pratara compared to the Naraka etc., the Vishkambha Suchi is the third root (164 16 = 256) multiplied by the second root (4 4 4 = 16) / Or there are series equal to the cube of the third root of the angula. The rest should be understood as the same as before. ] / Prajñāpanā Sūtra: Twelfth body section ends / 1. Prajñāpanā Sūtra Malay. Vṛtti, page numbers 282-284

This is the thirteenth 'Parinamapada' of the Prajnapana Sutra. * The word 'Parinama' has two meanings here - (1) The transformation of any substance from one state (Avastha) to another, without complete destruction or complete permanence, is Parinama, or (2) Parinama is the destruction in relation to the previous Satparyaya and the emergence in relation to the subsequent Asatparyaya. * This chapter discusses the Parinama of both Jiva and Ajeeva. * In Indian philosophies, Sankhya and other philosophies are Parinamavadi, while Nyaya and other philosophies are not Parinamavadi. * Philosophers who believe in the non-duality of Dharma and Dharmi accept Parinamavada, and those who believe in the ultimate duality of Dharma and Dharmi do not accept Parinamavada. * No object is completely destroyed, but it undergoes transformation or change of state. The destruction of the previous form leads to the creation of the subsequent form. This is the fundamental principle of Parinamavada. Therefore, the Tattvarth Sutra, the most important text of Jainism, states 'Tadbhavah Parinama' (meaning - its existence, i.e., being born and destroyed while remaining in its form, is Parinama). From this perspective, the Jiva, regardless of its form or state (Paryaya) in which it is born or destroyed, whether it is a human being, a sense organ, a yoga, a Leshya, a Kshaya, etc., remains in its original form, i.e., the original Jivadravya. Similarly, the transformation of Ajeeva into different forms or states while remaining in its original form is Ajeeva-Parinama. This chapter follows this Parinaminitya, first explaining the different types of Parinama of Jiva, then discussing them in the twenty-four Dandakas like Naraka, etc. Then, the different types of Parinama of Ajeeva are enumerated. Here, only the Parinama of Pudgala is presented in the Ajeeva Parinama, not the Parinama of the formless substances like Dharma, Astikaaya, etc. It is possible that the Parinama of the formless substances like Dharma, Adharma, Akash, Kala is included in the Aguru-Laghu Parinama (which is described as a single type) in the Ajeeva Parinama.

The thirteenth chapter, the thirteenth **paramānapada** (chapter on the nature of reality), deals with **parināma** (transformation) and its two types - 625. How many types of **parināma** are there, **bhavante** (venerable sir)? [625 Answer] **Gotama** (the name of the Jain sage), there are two types of **parināma**. They are: **jīva-parināma** (transformation of the soul) and **ajīva-parināma** (transformation of non-soul). /  [925 Question] **Bhagavan** (the Lord), how many types of **parināma** are there? [625 Answer] **Gotama**, there are two types of **parināma**. They are: **jīva-parināma** and **ajīva-parināma**. /  Discussion of **parināma** and its two types - This sūtra (aphorism) presents the two types of **parināma**: **jīva-parināma** and **ajīva-parināma**. The word "**parināma**" here is a technical term. Its etymological meaning is "to transform," meaning that a substance changes from one state to another. /  **Parināma** is diverse and complex due to the different **naya** (perspectives). There are many **naya** like **naigama** (general perspective), but the two main **naya** that encompass all others are **dravyaastika naya** (perspective of substance) and **paryayaastika naya** (perspective of modification). /  Therefore, according to **dravyaastika naya**, **parināma** (transformation) means that the substance, which exists in all three times (past, present, and future), acquires a different **dharma** (quality) in the form of a later **paryaya** (modification). In this situation, neither the complete cessation (absolute existence) nor the complete destruction (absolute non-existence) of the previous **paryaya** is **parināma**. It is also said that those who know the true nature of **parināma** consider the transition of a substance from one **paryaya** to another (change in meaning) as **parināma**, because a substance neither completely exists nor completely ceases to exist. /  However, according to **paryayaastika naya**, **parināma** is defined as the destruction of the previous existing **paryaya** and the emergence of the later non-existing **paryaya**. /  Two types of **parināma**: why and how? - Although **parināma** occurs in many ways, it primarily occurs based on the two substances, **jīva** (soul) and **ajīva** (non-soul). Therefore, the scholars have described two main types of **parināma**: **jīva-parināma** and **ajīva-parināma**. /  The transformation of the **jīva** is called **jīva-parināma**, and the transformation of the **ajīva** is called **ajīva-parināma**. 1. (a) **Prajñāpana** (explanation), **Malaya** (commentary), **Vṛtti** (commentary), page 284 /  (b) "**Parināmanam parināmaḥ** (transformation is **parināma**)."

The Thirteenth Resultant State [125 [635 Q.] O Bhagavan! How many types of Darshan-Parinaam are there? |635 A.] Gautama! (Darshan-Parinaam) is said to be of three types. They are as follows: (1) Samyag-Darshan-Parinaam, (2) Mithya-Darshan-Parinaam and (3) Samyami-thya-Darshan-Parinaam / 636.  [936 Q.] O Bhagavan! How many types of Charitra-Parinaam are there? [636 A.] Gautama! (Charitra-Parinaam) is said to be of five types.

[937 Q.] O Bhagavan! How many types of Ved-Parinaam are there? [937 A.] Gautama! (Ved-Parinaam) is said to be of three types. They are as follows: (1) Stri-Ved-Parinaam, (2) Purush-Ved-Parinaam and (3) Napumsak-Ved-Parinaam / Discussion - The ten types of Jiva-Parinaam and their sub-types - The 12 Sutras (Su. 626 to 937) mention the ten types of Jiva-Parinaam, starting with Gati-Parinaam, and describe the sub-types of each. Explanation of Gati-Parinaam etc. - (1) Gati-Parinaam - The attainment of a state like Narak (hell) due to the rise of the Karma called 'Narka-adi-Gati' is called 'Gati'. The state of Narak-adi-Gati, i.e., the state of being a Narak (hell) etc., is the Gati-Parinaam of the Jiva. (2) Indriya-Parinaam - The soul is called 'Indra' due to its being 'Indan', i.e., due to the attainment of the supreme state of knowledge. The means that are used to achieve the state of Indra are called 'Indriya'. This means that the main means (instrument) of the soul (Indra) is called 'Indriya'. The state of being 'Indriya' is called 'Indriya-Parinaam'. (3) Kashay-Parinaam - The state where beings harm (kill) each other is called 'Kash'. Or, the things that cause 'Kash', i.e., the state of Samsara (cycle of birth and death), are called 'Kashay'. The state of the Jiva being in the state of 'Kash' is called 'Kashay-Parinaam'. (4) Leshya-Parinaam - The nature of Leshya will be explained later. The state of being in the state of 'Leshya' is called 'Leshya-Parinaam'. (5) Yog-Parinaam - The activities of the mind, speech and body are called 'Yog'. The state of being in the state of 'Yog' is called 'Yog-Parinaam'. (6) Upayog-Parinaam - The state of the activity of the power of consciousness, which is in the form of concrete and abstract knowledge and perception, is called 'Upayog'. The state of being in the state of 'Upayog' is called 'Upayog-Parinaam'. (7) Gyaan-Parinaam - The state of being in the state of 'Mati-Gyaan' etc. is called 'Gyaan-Parinaam'. (8) Darshan-Parinaam - The state of being in the state of 'Samyag-Darshan' etc. is called 'Darshan-Parinaam'. (8)

##  [126] The fourfold nature of conduct, such as Samayika, etc., is the result of conduct (Charitraparinam) in the soul. (10) The transformation of the soul in the form of Strove, Veda, etc., is the Veda-parinam. The ten types of soul-transformation (Jivaparinam) are not manifested without the support of all the states of the sequence of Sangati-Audayika, etc., and the state of motion (Gatiparinam). Therefore, the state of motion (Gatiparinam) is first explained. When the state of motion (Gatiparinam) occurs, the state of sense organs (Indriyaparinam) is inevitable. Therefore, the state of sense organs (Indriyaparinam) is mentioned after it. After the state of sense organs (Indriyaparinam), the state of passions (Kshayaparinam) arises from contact with pleasant and unpleasant objects. Therefore, the state of passions (Kshayaparinam) is mentioned after it. The state of passions (Kshayaparinam) is inseparable from the state of subtle matter (Leshyaparinam), but the state of subtle matter (Leshyaparinam) can occur without the state of passions (Kshayaparinam). Therefore, the state of subtle matter (Leshyaparinam) is mentioned after the state of passions (Kshayaparinam). The state of subtle matter (Leshyaparinam) is the nature of the state of yoga (Yogaparinam). Therefore, the state of yoga (Yogaparinam) is mentioned after the state of subtle matter (Leshyaparinam). The state of use (Upayogaparinam) occurs in the transmigrating souls who are in the state of yoga (Yogaparinam). Therefore, the state of use (Upayogaparinam) is mentioned after the state of yoga (Yogaparinam). When the state of use (Upayogaparinam) occurs, the state of knowledge (Gyanaparinam) arises. Therefore, the state of knowledge (Gyanaparinam) is mentioned after the state of use (Upayogaparinam). There are two forms of the state of knowledge (Gyanaparinam) - the state of right knowledge (Samyaggyanaparinam) and the state of wrong knowledge (Mithyagyanaparinam). These two states are not possible without right conduct (Samyaktva) and wrong conduct (Mithyatva) (right faith (Samyagdarshan) and wrong faith (Mithyadarshan) respectively). Therefore, the state of faith (Darshanaparinam) is mentioned after the state of knowledge (Gyanaparinam). When the state of right faith (Samyagdarshanparinam) occurs, the soul, by hearing the words of the Jina, experiences the arising of unprecedented emotions, and the destruction and cessation of the conduct-covering karma (Charitravaranakarma) gives rise to the state of conduct (Charitraparinam). Therefore, the state of conduct (Charitraparinam) is mentioned after the state of faith (Darshanaparinam). Due to the influence of the state of conduct (Charitraparinam), the great souls destroy the state of Veda (Vedaparinam). Therefore, the state of Veda (Vedaparinam) is mentioned after the state of conduct (Charitraparinam).

##  _638. The Nairyikas are those who are in the state of motion (Gatiparinam) and are like those who are in the hellish state (Narakagati). They are those who have five senses due to the state of sense organs (Indriyaparinam). They are those who are passionate with anger (Krodhakashayi) and so on up to those who are passionate with greed (Lobhakashayi) due to the state of passions (Kshayaparinam). They are those who have black subtle matter (Krishna leshya) and so on up to those who have pigeon-colored subtle matter (Kapoteleshya) due to the state of subtle matter (Leshyaparinam). They are those who are mentally focused (Manoyogi), verbally focused (Vachanayogi), and physically focused (Kayayogi) due to the state of yoga (Yogaparinam). They are those who have the use of form (Sakaroupayog) and those who have the use of formlessness (Anakaroupayog) due to the state of use (Upayogaparinam). They are those who have knowledge of the self (Abhinibodhik (mati) gyani), those who have knowledge of scriptures (Shrutagnyani), and those who have knowledge of perception (Avadhigyani) due to the state of knowledge (Gyanaparinam). They are those who are ignorant of the self (Mati-agnyani), those who are ignorant of scriptures (Shrutagnyani), and those who are ignorant of perception (Avadhigyani) due to the state of ignorance (Agnyanaparinam). They are those who have right faith (Sammadditi), those who have wrong faith (Micchahitti), and those who have right wrong faith (Samm-amicchaditti) due to the state of faith (Darshanaparinam). They are those who have no conduct (No charitto), those who have conduct (No charittacharitto), and those who have no conduct (Acharitti) due to the state of conduct (Charitraparinam). They are those who are not in this world (No ithiviyaga), those who are not in the human world (No purisabaiyaga), and those who are not in the world of the non-human (Napusagaveyaga) due to the state of Veda (Vedaparinam). [938] The Nairyika souls are those who are in the state of motion (Gatiparinam) and are like those who are in the hellish state (Narakagati).

## Thirteenth Resultant State ] [ 127 Those who are ignorant of the scriptures and those who are knowledgeable of the divisions are both present; from the viewpoint of the result of perception, they are both Right-seeing, Wrong-seeing, and Mixed-seeing; from the viewpoint of the result of conduct, they are neither Conductual nor Conductual-in-the-world, but Non-conductual; from the viewpoint of the result of the Vedas, they are neither Hell-beings, nor Female-bodied, nor Male-bodied, but Eunuch-bodied / In the Narayikas of the discussion, the presentation of the ten types of results - The present sutra (638) presents the form of which result is found in which form among the ten types of results of beings in the hells.

Why is there no Conductual result in the hells? - From the viewpoint of the Conductual result, the hell-beings are neither Conductual nor Conductual-in-the-world (Worldly-conductual), they remain Non-conductual / Complete Conductuality is only possible in humans, and Worldly-conductuality is only possible in humans and the five-sensed animals, therefore, there is absolutely no Conductual result in the hells. Why are the hells only Eunuch-bodied from the viewpoint of the Vedic result? - The hells are neither female nor male; therefore, the hells are only Eunuch-bodied / It is also said in the Tattvartha Sutra - 'The hells and the Summuchhim beings are eunuchs.'

## Translation:

**[128]** This Sutra (939) describes the ten types of results for the ten types of Bhavanavasi Devas, from Asurakumara to Stanitakumara, with a few exceptions. The Bhavanavasi Devas are described in a similar way to the Narakas, with some differences. Most of the results of the Bhavanavasi Devas are similar to those of the Nairyikas, but there are some differences. For example, they are Devagati in terms of Gatiparinam, and they have three Leshyas like the Narakas in terms of Leshyaparinam, but the Mahddhik Bhavanavasi Devas also have a fourth Tejo-Leshya. In terms of Vedaparinam, they are not Napusakavedi like the Narakas, because Devas are not Napusak. Therefore, the Bhavanavasis are only Strovedi and Purushavedi.

**[940.1]** The Prithvikaiyika Jivas are Tiryanch-Gati in terms of Gatiparinam, Ekaindriya in terms of Indriaparinam, and the rest (all other results) are the same as the Nairyikas. The special feature is that they also have Tejo-Leshya in terms of Leshyaparinam. They are only Kayayogi in terms of Yogaparinam, and they do not have Jnana-parinam. They are both Mati-Agnani and Shruta-Agnani in terms of Agnanaparinam (but not Vibhang-Agnani). They are only Mithyadristi in terms of Darshanaparinam (not Samyagdristi or Samyamithyadristi). The rest (all other descriptions) are the same as before.

**[940.2]** The same (description of results) applies to the Apkaiyika and Vanaspatikaiyika.

**[940.3]** The same (description of results) applies to the Tejaskaiyika and Vayukaiyika. The special feature is that they have three Leshyas in terms of Leshyaparinam, the same as the Nairyikas (as described in Sutra 938).

**[641.1]** The Beindriya are Tiryanch-Gati in terms of Gatiparinam, Beindriya in terms of Indriaparinam, and the rest (all other results) are the same as the Nairyikas. The special feature is that they are both Vayayogi and Kayayogi in terms of Yogaparinam. They have Prabhini in terms of Gnanaparinam.

[129] Both the good and the bad, in the result of knowledge, both the good and the bad in the result of knowledge, not the fragmented, in the result of perception, both the right view and the wrong view, not the right-wrong view / the rest is the same / [141-1] The two-sense beings are of the animal realm in the result of motion, they are two-sense beings in the result of sense. The rest (description of all results) should be understood like the Niryayikas (as mentioned in Sutra 638). The special feature is that (they) are also capable of speech in the result of conduct, and also capable of body conduct; in the result of knowledge, they are also knowers of the revealed and also knowers of the heard; in the result of ignorance, they are also knowers of the mind and also knowers of the heard; (but they are) not knowers of the fragmented. In the result of perception, they are also right-sighted and also wrong-sighted; (but) they are not right-wrong sighted / the rest (all descriptions) should be understood in the same way (as the Niryayikas mentioned earlier) / [2] And so on until the four-sense beings / the number of senses should be increased in the body / [641-2] In the same way, one should understand up to the four-sense beings (three-sense, four-sense). The special feature is that (in the three-sense and four-sense, one by one) the sense should be increased. 942. The five-sense animal-born beings are of the animal realm in the result of motion. The rest is like the Niryayikas (Sutra 938) / the number should be increased in the result of subtle body from the black subtle body up to the white subtle body, in the result of conduct, they are not full-conduct, they are also partial-conduct and also conduct-non-conduct (country-conduct); in the result of knowledge, they are also female-knowers, also male-knowers and also neuter-knowers / [942] The five-sense animal-born beings are of the animal realm in the result of motion / the rest (in Sutra 638) is like the Niryayikas (statement regarding results); (one should understand in the same way) / the special feature is that in the result of subtle body, (they are from the black subtle body up to) also the white subtle body. In the result of conduct, they are not (fully) conduct, they are also partial-conduct and also conduct-non-conduct (country-conduct); in the result of knowledge, they are also female-knowers, also male-knowers and also neuter-knowers. 

The description of the results of the one-sense to five-sense animal beings - the three Sutras presented here, Sutra 640 describes the one-sense beings, Sutra 941 describes the impaired-sense beings (two-sense, three-sense, four-sense) and Sutra 942 describes the five-sense animals, the description of the results is done in a very exaggerated way, similar to the Niryayika beings, except for a few things. The difference in the description of the results of the Niryayikas - in the result of motion, the Niryayikas are of the hell realm, while the one-sense to five-sense animals are of the animal realm; in the result of sense, the Niryayikas are five-sense beings, while the earth-bodied, etc. one-sense beings are only one touch-sense beings, the two-sense beings are touch-sense and taste-sense, these two-sense beings, the three-sense beings are touch-sense, taste-sense, and smell-sense, these three-sense beings, and the four-sense beings are touch-sense, taste-sense, smell-sense, and sight-sense, these four-sense beings, and the five-sense animals are five-sense beings (touch, taste, breath, sight, and hearing). In the result of subtle body - the hell beings have three subtle bodies, while the (earth-water-plant-bodied) one-sense beings also have the fourth fire subtle body. Because the gods up to the Saudharma and Ishana heavens also have these...

[130] The Prajñāyāna Sūtra can be generated. In the Tejaskaayika-Vāyukaayika, there are three types of Leśyā at the beginning, like the Nāraka. In the Tiryañc-pañcendriya beings, all six Leśyā are possible, up to the Śuklaleśyā. Due to Yoga-pariṇāma, the Nāraka experience all three Yogas, while the Pṛthvīkāyādi, being one-indriyan, are only Kāyayogi. The Vikaleṇdriya are both Vacyayogi and Kāyayogi, while the Tiryañc-pañcendriya experience all three Yogas. Due to Jñāna-pariṇāma, the Nāraka have three types of Jñāna, while the one-indriyan do not experience Jñāna-pariṇāma, because in the Pṛthvīkāyādi, up to the five-indriyan, even the Sāsvādana-samyaktvā is prohibited in the Prāgamas, therefore Jñāna is prohibited in them. The Vikaleṇdriya are also Ābhinibodhik-jñānī and Śruta-jñānī, because some two-indriyan beings are found to have Sāsvādana-samyaktvā in the Karaṇāparyāpta-avasthā, therefore they are called Jñāna-dvaya-pariṇata. The pañcendriya-tiryañc have three types of Jñāna, like the Nāraka. Due to Ajñāna-pariṇāma, the Nāraka are transformed by all three Ajñāna, while due to the absence of Samyaktvā, the one-indriyan and Vikaleṇdriya beings have two Ajñāna: Mati-ajñāna and Śruta-prajñāna, not Vibhangajñāna; the Tiryañc-pañcendriya have all three Ajñāna. Due to Darśana-pariṇāma, the Nāraka beings are endowed with all three Dṛṣṭi, while the one-indriyan have only Mithyāṣṭi, the Vikaleṇdriya have Samyagdṛṣṭi and Mithyā-dṛṣṭi in relation to Sāsvādana-samyaktvā, and the Tiryañc-pañcendriya have all three Dṛṣṭi. From the perspective of Veda-pariṇāma, the one-indriyan and Vikaleṇdriya beings are like the Nāraka, being only Napuṃsakavedī, while the Tiryañc-pañcendriya have all three Vedas (Strī-puruṣa-napuṃsakavedī). From the perspective of Cāritra-pariṇāma, the one-indriyan and Vikaleṇdriya beings, like the Nāraka, are completely incapable of Cāritra-pariṇāma, while the Tiryañc-pañcendriya are capable of Cāritra-pariṇāma in a particular place. These Pariṇāma are mentioned in relation to the Nāraka, etc., this should be kept in mind. This is the difference in Pariṇāma between them and the Nāraka. The description of the Pariṇāma of humans is as follows: 943. Manuṣya, due to Gati-pariṇāma, are Manuṣyagati; due to Indriya-pariṇāma, they are pañcendriya, also anindriya; due to Kaṣāya-pariṇāma, they are Krodhakaṣāyī, Mānakṣāyī, Māyākṣāyī, Lobhakaṣāyī, and also Akaṣāyī; due to Leśyā-pariṇāma, they are from Kṛṣṇaleśyā to Śuklaleśyā, and also Aleśyā; due to Yoga-pariṇāma, they are Manoyogi, Vacyayogi, Kāyayogi, and also Ayogi; due to Upayoga-pariṇāma, they are like the Nairyika (as mentioned in Sū. 938); due to Jñāna-pariṇāma, they are from Ābhinibodhik-jñānī to even Kevala-jñānī; due to Ajñāna-pariṇāma, they have all three Ajñāna; due to Darśana-pariṇāma, they have all three Darśana; due to Cāritra-pariṇāma, they are Cāritī, Acāritta, and also Cāritta-acāritta; due to Veda-pariṇāma, they are Iṣṭhivedī, Puruṣavedī, Napuṃsakavedī, and also Avedī.

The Thirteenth Resultant State [131 are those who are ignorant; from the standpoint of the perception resultant state (in them) all three perceptions (right perception, wrong perception and mixed perception) are present; from the standpoint of the conduct resultant state (they) are also those who have conduct, those who do not have conduct and those who have conduct and do not have conduct (those who have conduct according to the country); from the standpoint of the knowledge resultant state (they) are also those who have knowledge of women, those who have knowledge of men and those who have knowledge of eunuchs as well as those who do not have knowledge. Discussion - In the present sutra (643) regarding the description of humans in relation to the resultant states, humans (the collective human race) have been considered from the standpoint of motion and the other ten resultant states. In particular - humans are distinct from other beings due to many resultant states and are also superior to them in many resultant states, such as being without senses, without passions, without attachment, without karma, having perfect knowledge, being aware of the mind, not having knowledge, etc. / ' The description of the Vaanavyantara, Jyotishka and Vaimanika Devas in relation to the resultant states 944. The Vaanavyantara Devas are of the Deva-gati due to the motion resultant state, just like the Asura-kumara (Su. 636 [1]) / [944] The Vaanavyantara Devas are of the Deva-gati due to the motion resultant state, the rest (all statements regarding the resultant states) should be understood (like) the Asura-kumara (Su. 939-1). 145. And the Jyotishkas / are of the Tejo-leshya due to the leshya resultant state. [945] Similarly, one should understand regarding all the resultant states of the Jyotishkas. The special thing is that from the standpoint of the leshya resultant state (they are only) those who have the Tejo-leshya. _646. The Vaimanikas are also like this. From the standpoint of the leshya resultant state, they are also those who have the Tejo-leshya, those who have the Padma-leshya and those who have the Shukla-leshya. This is the description of the beings. Discussion - In the present three sutras regarding the description of the Vaanavyantara, Jyotishka and Vaimanika Devas in relation to the resultant states, the description of the Vaanavyantara Devas in Su. 644, the Jyotishka Devas in Su. 945 and the Vaimanika Devas in Su. 646 has been done in excess, leaving out a few things, like the Asura-kumara. The special thing in the leshya resultant state of the Jyotishkas and the Vaimanikas - the Jyotishkas only have the Tejo-leshya, while the Vaimanikas have the Tejo-leshya, the Padma-leshya and the Shukla-leshya, these three auspicious leshyas; they do not have the three inauspicious leshyas. 1.

[134] [From the Prajñāpanā [955 Pr.] Bhagavan! How many types of touch-result are said to be? [955 U.] Gautama! (Touch-result) is said to be of eight types. It is as follows: (2) Harsh (hard) touch-result. (2) Mad-touch-result (3) Guru-touch-result. (4) Laghu-touch-result, (5) Ushna-touch-result, (6) Shita-touch-result, (7) Snigdha-touch-result and (8) Rūksha-touch-result. 656. Pragyasya-laya-result, O Bhagavan! How many types are there? Gotama! It is said to be of one type. [956 Pr.] Bhagavan! How many types of Aguru-laghu-result are said to be? [956 U.] Gautama! (Aguru-laghu-result) is said to be of one type only. / 957. Saha-result, O Bhagavan! How many types are there? Gotama! It is said to be of two types. / Such as -  Surabhi-saha-result and Durabhi-saha-result. / This is the description of Ajiva-result.  // The thirteenth result-chapter of the Bhagavan's teachings is complete. // [957 Pr.] Bhagavan! How many types of sound-result are said to be? [657 U.] Gautama! (Sound-result) is said to be of two types. It is as follows: Surabhi (auspicious-pleasant) sound-result and Durabhi (inauspicious-unpleasant) sound-result. / This is the description of Ajiva-result! Explanation - Ajiva-result and its divisions - The description of Ajiva-result and its divisions has been presented in the first eleven sutras (from sutra 647 to 957), out of which the first sutra (947) describes the ten divisions of Ajiva-result and the remaining ten sutras describe the divisions of each of those ten divisions in order. Explanation of Bandhana-result - The mutual binding (joining) of two or more pudgalas, becoming close, becoming one-result or becoming a lump is called bandhana or bandha. / It has two types - Snigdha-bandhana-result and Rūksha-bandhana-result. / The binding-result of Snigdha pudgala is Snigdha-bandhana-result and the binding-result of Rūksha pudgala is Rūksha-bandhana-result.  Rules of Bandhana-result - How and by what rule does the binding-result of Snigdha and Rūksha take place? The scholars explain this through two verses - If there is mutual samasnigdhata (equal snigdhata) and samgunasnigdhata (equal quality snigdhata) in the pudgalas, then their bandha (binding) will not take place. Similarly, if there is mutual samarūkshata (equal rūkshata) and samganarūkshata (equal quality rūkshata) in the pudgalas, then their bandha will not take place. The meaning is that the samgunasnigdha paramanu etc. do not have a relationship (bandha) with the samgunasnigdha paramanu etc.; similarly, the samgunarūksha paramanu etc. do not have a bandha with the samgunarūksha paramanu etc.; but if there is a difference in the amount of snigdhata and rūkshata, then the bandha of the skandhas takes place. That is, if the snigdha skandha is with the snigdha and the rūksha skandha is with the rūksha skandha, then the bandha takes place.

## Thirteenth Resultant State [135]

When there are odd qualities, then due to the odd quantity, there is mutual connection (bond) between them. / The conclusion is that bond happens only when there is an odd quantity. Therefore, to explain the odd quantity, the scholar says again - If the bond of a smooth atom etc. can happen with an atom etc. having a smooth quality, then according to the rule, it happens only with an atom having two or more (two more) qualities. Similarly, if the bond of an atom etc. having a rough quality happens with an atom etc. having a rough quality, then it can also happen according to the same rule only with an atom having two, three, four or more qualities, otherwise not. When the bond of smooth and rough pudgalas happens mutually, then according to what rule does it happen? For this, the scholar says - The bond of a smooth atom etc. with a rough atom etc. happens by leaving out the lowest category. The meaning of lowest is - one-quality smooth and one-quality rough. / Leaving these out, the bond of the remaining two-quality (smooth etc.) happens with the two-quality rough etc., whether they both (smooth and rough) are in equal quantity or in odd quantity.

**Explanation of Motion Resultant State** - Motion-like transformation is the motion resultant state. It is of two types - contact motion resultant state and non-contact motion resultant state. / The motion that happens by touching the other objects coming in between is called contact motion. That motion-like resultant state is called contact motion resultant state. For example - A stone thrown diagonally on water, intentionally, moves by touching the water in between, this is the contact motion resultant state of that stone. The motion that does not touch any substance coming in between is called non-contact motion. / That non-contact motion-like resultant state is called non-contact motion resultant state. For example - When a liberated (freed) being moves towards the liberated rock, then their motion is non-contact motion. / Or, in another way, two divisions of motion resultant state are presented - long motion resultant state and short motion resultant state. / The resultant state that is the cause of attaining a distant land is called long motion resultant state, and the resultant state that is the cause of attaining a nearby land is called short motion resultant state. Their explanation has been done earlier in the synonym word, language word etc. like the explanation of establishment resultant state, difference resultant state, color resultant state, smell resultant state, taste resultant state and touch resultant state.

**Heavy-Light Resultant State** - 'Karma-mana-bhasai eyaai pragurulghuyai' i.e. - Karma-category, mind-category and language-category, these are heavy-light, according to this Agam statement, the above substances and also the abstract sky etc. substances should be understood as heavy-light. In this context, the heavy-light resultant state should also be understood. 3 'Generous, changing, nourishing and fiery substances are heavy-light. / / **End of Thirteenth Resultant State** / /

This is the fourteenth chapter of the Prajnapana Sutra, titled "Kasaya-pada". Kasayas are the causes of worldly growth, they nourish the root of rebirth, and they taint the pure soul with passions like anger. They are the cause of the eight types of karma: *chya*, *upachaya*, *bandha*, *udīraṇa*, *vedanā*, etc. It is essential to understand them because they are connected to the soul's various aspects. This is why the Kasaya-pada was written.

This chapter first explains the four main types of Kasayas: anger, pride, deceit, and greed. It then explains that these four Kasayas are found in all twenty-four types of *dandakavarti* beings. Next, it discusses the four bases of these four Kasayas: *yatma-pratiṣṭhita*, *para-pratiṣṭhita*, *ubhaya-pratiṣṭhita*, and *apratiṣṭhita*. It also explains the four causes of these Kasayas: *kṣetra*, *vāstu*, *śarīra*, and *upadhi*. These are the causes of Kasayas in all beings in the world.

Then, it explains the four types of Kasayas: *ananta-anubandhi*, *ābhōga-nirvṛtti*, etc., and states that they exist in all beings in the world. Finally, it explains the six consequences of the Kasayas: *chya*, *upachaya*, *bandha*, *udīraṇa*, *vedanā*, and *nirjarā*, which are the results of the soul's actions.

Jain scriptures describe various flaws and vices of the soul in many ways. These flaws are also categorized separately. One such category is *rāga*, *dveṣa*, and *moha*. However, in the theory of karma, the four Kasayas and *moha* are the primary focus. The previous chapter discussed the various states of the soul, and Kasayas are one such state.

This chapter is described in 14 sutras from Sutra 658 to 971.

Page #725:
---------------------------
The fourteenth Kasaya-pada (the fourteenth stage of Kasaya) is about Kasaya and its four types. 658. How many types of Kasaya are there, Venerable? [958] Gautam! There are four types of Kasaya. They are: (1) Krodha-Kasaya (anger), (2) Mana-Kasaya (pride), (3) Maya-Kasaya (deceit), and (4) Lobha-Kasaya (greed). / [958]  

**Explanation**

This Sutra mentions the four types of Kasaya, namely Krodha (anger) and the others. 

**Explanation of Kasaya**

The word Kasaya has three etymological meanings:

(1) Kas means Samsara (the cycle of birth and death), and its income and profit are called Kasaya. 

(2) The root word 'Krish' means to cultivate, and from this, 'Krish' becomes 'Kas' by an order, and the suffix 'Aya' is added, forming the word Kasaya. This means that those who cultivate the field of Karma (action) to produce the grain of happiness and sorrow are Kasaya.

(3) The root word 'Kalush' also becomes 'Kas' by an order, forming the word Kasaya. This means that those who naturally pollute the pure soul with Karma-malin (impurities) are Kasaya.

The Tattvartha Sutra states that Karma is acquired through Kasaya: "Sakashayatvaajjivah karmaano yogyaana pudgalanaadatte" - A soul, being attached to Kasaya, acquires the Pudgalas (particles) that are suitable for Karma.

The Dasha-Kalika Sutra also states: "These four Kasayas irrigate the root of rebirth." 2

## 138] [The Twenty-Four Dandakas of the Prajnapana Sutra: The Nature of Kshaya 656.

"How many Kshayas are there, Venerable One?"

"Gautama, there are four Kshayas. They are: from Krodha Kshaya to Lobha Kshaya, and so on, up to the Vaimanika."

[959 Pr.] "Venerable One, how many Kshayas are there in the Nairyika Jivas?"

[959 U.] "Gautama, there are four Kshayas in them. They are: from Krodha Kshaya to Lobha Kshaya, and so on, up to the Vaimanika."

(In the Twenty-Four Dandaka-varti Jivas, all four Kshayas are found.)

**Discussion:** This Sutra (956) describes the presence of all four Kshayas in all worldly beings, from the Nairyika to the Vaimanika.

**The Nature of the Establishment of Kshayas:**

[960] [1] "Venerable One, on how many things is Krodha established (dependent)?"

[660-1 Pr.] "Gautama, Krodha is established on four (causes). They are: (1) Atma-prati-sthiya, (2) Para-prati-sthiya, (3) Tadubhaya-prati-sthiya, and (4) Apra-prati-sthiya."

[660-1 U.] "Gautama, Krodha is established on four (causes). They are: (1) Atma-prati-sthiya, (2) Para-prati-sthiya, (3) Tadubhaya-prati-sthiya, and (4) Apra-prati-sthiya."

[2] "And so on, from the Nairyika to the Vaimanika, there is a Dandaka."

[960-2] "And so on, from the Nairyika to the Vaimanika (in the Twenty-Four Dandaka-varti Jivas), there is a Dandaka (one should say 'Malapaka')."

[3] "And so on, there is a Dandaka for Mana, a Dandaka for Maya, and a Dandaka for Lobha."

[960-3] "And so on, there is a Dandaka for Mana, a Dandaka for Maya, and a Dandaka for Lobha (one should say 'Malapaka')."

**Discussion:** This Sutra (960-1, 2, 3) describes the establishment of the four Kshayas, Krodha, Mana, Maya, and Lobha, on four different bases.

**The Four-fold Establishment of Krodha, etc.:**

(1) **Atma-prati-sthiya Krodha, etc.:** This is when Krodha, etc., is based on oneself. This means that when a Jiva sees his own worldly misfortune (Apaya = loss) as a result of his own actions, he becomes angry, proud, deceitful, or greedy towards himself. This is Atma-prati-sthiya Krodha, etc. This Krodha, etc., is directed towards oneself.

(2) **Para-prati-sthiya:**

Page #727:
---------------------------
## Fourteenth Kshaya Pada [139]

**Parapratiṣṭhita Krodhādi** - When a being considers another person or living or non-living being as the cause of their misfortune and experiences anger, etc., or when another person provokes anger, etc., by their actions, the anger, etc., that arises towards them is called Parapratiṣṭhita Krodhādi. (3)

**Ubhayapratiṣṭhita Krodhādi** - Sometimes a being experiences anger, etc., towards themselves and others. For example, when a person experiences anger, etc., towards themselves due to their own or another's wrongdoing, then that anger, etc., is called Ubhayapratiṣṭhita. (4)

**Aapratiṣṭhita Krodhādi** - When anger, etc., arises without any external cause like misconduct, anger, etc., and solely due to the arising of the (painful) Mohaniya, then that anger, etc., is called Aapratiṣṭhita. Such anger, etc., is not Atmapraitiṣṭhita because it does not arise due to one's own misconduct, etc., nor is it Parapratiṣṭhita because there is no opposing conduct, behavior, or offense from another, making 'another' not the cause of that anger, etc. It is also not Ubhayapratiṣṭhita because it does not have both types of causes. Therefore, this anger, etc., is anger, etc., that arises without any external cause, solely due to the arising of the Mohaniya (painful). Such a person later says, "Oh! I was angry without any reason; no one spoke against me, nor did anyone harm me."

**Four Causes of the Origin of Kshayas** 661. [1] "Bante! How many places (causes) does anger arise from?" "Gotama! Anger arises from four places (causes). They are as follows: (1) due to a field (farm or open land), (2) due to a building (house, etc.), (3) due to the body, and (4) due to an object (tools, resources, materials)." [961-1]

[2] "Similarly, from the Nairyikas to the Vaimanikas (the same principle should be applied regarding the origin of anger)." [961-2]

[3] "Similarly, with Mana, Maya, and Lobha (the same four causes should be stated for their origin as stated for anger). Thus, these are the four Dandakas (speakers)." [961-3]

**Discussion** - The four causes of the origin of Kshayas like anger, etc. - This sutra (961-1,2,3) presents the four causes of the origin of Kshayas like anger, etc., which are field, building, body, and object. 1. Prajñāpanasūtra Malaya, Vṛtti, Patrānka 290.

Page #728:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**140]** **Why does anger and other passions arise from knowledge, field, body and designation?** - The meaning of field is land or ground, but for hell beings, it should be understood as the field of hell, for animals, the field of animals, for humans, the field of humans, and for gods, the field of gods, in relation to the arising of anger and other passions. 'Vathu' has two meanings - vastu and vastu. The meaning of vastu is house, building, bungalow, mansion, palace, etc., and the meaning of vastu is living, non-living matter. Anger and other passions arise even when it comes to palaces, houses, etc. Anger, conflict, pride, etc., arise when it comes to living beings like mother, father, wife, son, or any other creature. Anger and other passions arise when it comes to non-living things like bed, gold, silver, gems, ruby, pearl, clothes, ornaments, etc. Anger and other passions also arise when it comes to a deformed or conscious-unconscious body. Anger and other passions arise when it comes to disorganized and broken equipment, or when it is stolen by thieves, etc. Anger and other passions arise when land, house, body, and other resources are damaged or harmed for any reason. Here, 'designation' should be understood to include all things except land, house, and body.

**662.** **[1]** **How many types of anger are there, O Lord?** - **Gautama!** Anger is said to be of four types. They are - (1) Anantanubandhi anger, (2) Apratyakhyana anger, (3) Pratyakhyanavaran anger, and (4) Sanjwalan anger. **[2]** **And from hell beings to celestial beings.** (These four types of anger should be understood in the twenty-four Dandakavarti beings.) **[3]** **And in relation to pride, illusion, and greed.** (These four types of anger should be understood in relation to pride, illusion, and greed, and their presence should be stated from hell beings to celestial beings.) These are also four Dandakas.

**663.** **[1]** **How many types of anger are there, O Lord?** - **Gautama!** Anger is said to be of four types. They are - (a) Pabhoganivatti, (b) Pranabhoganivyattie, (c) Uvasante, and (d) Pranuvasante.

Fourteenth Kashaya Pada]] [ 141 [963-1 U.] Gautama! Anger is said to be of four types. It is as follows (1) Abhoga Nirvartita, (2) Anabhoga Nirvartita, (3) Upashanta and (4) Anupashanta  /  [2] And in the same way, from Narakas to Vaimanikas, four types of anger should be mentioned. [3] And in the same way, there are four types of pride, deceit and greed (Abhoga Nirvartita etc.)  /  {963-3] Like anger, there are four types of pride, deceit and greed (Abhoga Nirvartita etc.) and (from Narakas to Vaimanikas) these four types of pride, deceit and greed should be understood (as Dandaka). Discussion-The differentiation of Kashayas like anger is presented in the two sutras (Su. 962, 963) by differentiating the Kashayas like anger into four types, Anantanubandhi etc., and describing their presence in all sentient beings. And from the different types of Kashayas like anger, four types, Abhoga Nirvartita etc., and their presence in all sentient beings are described. Definition of the four types, Anantanubandhi etc.-The meaning of these four Kashayas will be discussed in the Karma Prakriti Pada. Here, the definition of the four is given-Anantanubandhi is the destroyer of the Samyaktvaguna, Apratyakhyana is the destroyer of the Deshvirati guna, Pratyakhyana Avarana is the destroyer of the Sarva Virati guna and Sanjwalana is the destroyer of the Yathakyata Charitra.  /  Explanation of the four types of anger etc., Prabhoga Nirvartita etc.-Prabhoga Nirvartita (arising from use) anger-When someone gets angry knowing the offense of another and taking recourse to a strong reason for anger and in a different way, he cannot be taught, then this type of anger arising from use (thought) is called Prabhoga Nirvartita (arising from thought)  /  Anabhoga Nirvartita anger-(arising without use) When a sentient being, who is simply under the influence of delusion, without any consideration of good and bad qualities, gets angry, then that anger is called Anabhoga Nirvartita. Upashanta anger-Anger that does not reach the state of arising is called 'Upashanta'. Anupashanta anger-Anger that reaches the state of arising is called 'Anupashanta'.  /  Description of the eight Karma Prakritis from Kashayas- 664. [1] Jiwa Gan Bante!

The choice, increase, binding, arousal, experience, and exhaustion of the eight karma-prakr̥tis by the beings of the world and the twenty-four daṇḍakavarti beings due to the four kaṣāyas are described separately. / In the past, present, and future, the beings of the world and the beings of the twenty-four daṇḍakas, from the narakas to the vaimānikas, have chosen, increased, bound, aroused, experienced, and exhausted the eight karma-prakr̥tis due to anger, pride, deceit, and greed. Choice, increase, etc., are defined as follows: Choice - the taking up (grasping) of karma-pudgalas fit for karma by the being after they have been transformed by kaṣāya. Increase - the creation (formation) of karma-pudgalas for the experience (enjoyment) of the jñānāvaraṇīya, etc., karma-pudgalas after their unimpeded time. This creation is called niṣeka. Its order is as follows: in the first state, there is the most substance, in the second state, there is no particularity, in the third state, there is even less particularity than that, and so on, karma-pudgalas with less and less particularity are established for experience. Binding - the extraction of the jñānāvaraṇīya, etc., karma-pudgalas that have been created in the proper way by the specific kaṣāya-transformation is called binding. Arousal - the karma that has not yet arisen is brought into the udya-avalikā by arousal. Experience - the enjoyment (experiencing) of karma after its unimpeded time has ended, or after it has been aroused, is called experience. Exhaustion - the karma-pudgalas become akarma-rupa after their experience (enjoyment), i.e., they fall away from the self-regions. In the present chapter, the exhaustion of the region is stated. Universal exhaustion occurs when one, free from kaṣāya, completely stops the yogas and ascends to the abode of liberation. Regional exhaustion is something that all beings always do. / Prajñāpanā Sūtra: The fourteenth kaṣāya-pada is complete. / / 1. Prajñāpanā Sūtra Malay, Vṛtti, Patrāṅka 292

This is the fifteenth Indriyapad of the Prajnapana Sutra. * Indriyas are the instruments for recognizing the soul, through them the existence of the soul is perceived. * This pad analyzes all aspects related to the Indriyas. It has two Uddesakas / The first Uddesaka initially states the 24 Dvaras / The second Uddesaka describes the Indriyas through 12 Dvaras. The first Uddesaka discusses 6 Dvaras from Sansthana to Alpabahutva, considering them in relation to the 24 Dandakas / Subsequently, the description of the seventh Sprustdvara to the ninth Dvara, called Vishaya, is presented / These Dvaras are not considered in relation to the twenty-four Dandakas, but rather in relation to the Indriyas. Following this, there is a discussion of the Indriyas, particularly the Chakshusindriya, in relation to Angara and Aahara. Subsequently, from the twelfth to the eighteenth Dvara, there is a description, particularly related to the Chakshusindriya, through the Dvaras from Adarsa to Vasa. Then, through the 6 Dvaras from Kambala, Sthuna (Stambh), Thiggal, Dvipodhi, Lok and Alok, there is a description, particularly related to the Sparshendriya. In the second Uddesaka, the nature and types of Indriyas are described through the 12 Dvaras of Upacaya, Nirvartana, Samaya, Labdhi, Upayogakala, Alpabahutva, Avgrahana, Iha, Avaya, Vyanjanavgraha, Dravyendriya and Bhavendriya, and at the same time, they are considered in relation to the 24 Dandakas. * The first four, Upacaya, Nirvartana, Labdhi and Upayoga, are included in Dravyendriya at the beginning and the last two in Bhavendriya. * Acharya Malayagiri has considered the Adarshadvara etc. to be related to the visible object / Whatever the visible object may be, the object that the soul uses or chooses is considered to be the visible object, so when seeing a reflection, the perception, use or choice is related to the reflection object in Adarsa etc. There is an interesting discussion about this in Nishothabhashya etc. * In the Dravyendriya and Bhavendriya Dvaras, the 24 Dandakavarti Jivas are discussed in detail, both in the Pratot, Baddha (present) and Anagat (future) Indriyas / 00 1.

**Panarasamam Indriyapayam: Padhamo Uddeeso Pandaravaan Indriyapad: Prathama Uddeeshak**

**First Uddeeshak**

The first Uddeeshak presents twenty-four doors (972).

**Discussion-**

The first Uddeeshak presents twenty-four doors- the two presented Gāthās mention the twenty-four doors related to Indriyas presented in the first Uddeeshak. Explanation of the twenty-four doors-(1) **Santhaan** door- this presents the structure-form of the Indriyas, (2) **Baahaly** door- this describes the grossness (Bahlata) of the Indriyas, meaning their physical form, (3) **Pruthutva** door- this presents the expanse of the Indriyas, (4) **Kati-Pradesh** door- this explains how many regions each Indriya has, (5) **Pravagaadh** door- this describes how many regions each Indriya is immersed in. (6) **Alpabahutva** door- this presents the Alpabahutva related to immersion and harshness, (7) **Sprušt** door- this presents the presentation related to the touched and untouched, (8) **Pravist** door- this discusses the entered and not entered, (9) **Vishay** door- this describes the quantity of the objects, (10) **Anngār** door- this contains the sutras related to Anngār, (11) **Praahar** door- this contains the sutras related to Praahar, (12) **Praadarsh** door- this presents the presentation related to the mirror, (13) **Asi** door- this presents the presentation related to the Asi, (14) **Mani** door- the statement related to the Mani, (15) **Udapaan** door- the presentation related to drinking water or Udupaan (or the presentation related to milk and drinking), (16) **Tail** door- this contains the statement related to Tail, (17) **Phanit** door- this contains the statement related to Phanit (Jaggery). 1. In many copies, there is a variant reading- **Duddhapaane**- in which the two doors of milk and drinking are separated. But according to the text of Nīśīth Sutra (U. 13), the reading **Udupaane** seems to be authentic. 2. Some Acharyas consider Dweep and Udhadhi as two separate doors. ......

The fifteenth Indriya-pada: The first Uddesaka [147 is the Prarupana, (18) Vasadvara - this describes the subject of fat, (16) Kambaladvara - this describes the subject of blankets, (20) Sthunanadvara - this describes the subject of Sthuna (stupa or stump), (21) Thiggaladvara - this describes the subject of Akash Thiggal, (22) Dvipodhadhidvara - this describes the subject of islands and oceans, (23) Lokadvara - this describes the subject of Lokas, and (24) Alokadvara - this describes the subject of Alok. The number of Indriyas is 973. How many, O Venerable One! are the Indriyas said to be? [973 U.] Gautama! Five Indriyas are said to be. They are as follows: (1) Shrotrendriya, (2) Chakshusindriya, (3) Ghrānendriya, (4) Jihvendriya and (5) Sparshendriya. Discussion - The number of Indriyas - In the present Sutra, the Prarupana of the five Indriyas, Shrotrendriya etc., is done. Other philosophical views - In the Sankhya, Yoga, etc., Darshanas, the five Indriyas, Shrotrendriya etc., are called Jnanendriyas, and Vak, Pani (hand), Pad (foot), Payu (urinary tract) and Upastha (anus), these five Indriyas are called Karmendriyas. But the acceptance of five Karmendriyas is not logical. In Jain Darshan, two types of each, Dravyendriya and Bhavendriya, and two types of Dravyendriya, Nivritti and Upkarana, and two types of Bhavendriya, Labdhi and Upayoga, are described. Their description will be done in the second Uddesaka of this Pada. The first Sansthanadvara 674. [1] O Venerable One! How is Shrotrendriya said to be? [974-1 U.] Gautama! (It) is said to be of the shape of Kadambapushpa. [2] O Venerable One! How is Chakshusindriya said to be? [974-2 U.] Gautama! (Chakshusindriya) is said to be of the shape of Masur-Chandra. 1.

## Fifteenth Indriya-pada: First Uddeshaka

[149 [2] And so on, up to the external aspect of the touch sense.] [975-2] In the same way, one should understand the external aspect of the eye sense up to the touch sense. 676. [1] "Venerable sir, how wide is the ear sense?" [976-1 Pr.] "Gautama, the ear sense is said to be as wide as an immeasurable fraction of an angula." [976-1 Ut.] [2] And so on, for the eye sense and the nose sense.] [976-2] In the same way, one should understand the width of the eye sense and the nose sense. [3] "Venerable sir, how wide is the tongue sense?" [976-3 Pr.] "Gautama, the tongue sense is as wide as an angula." [976-3 Ut.] [4] "Venerable sir, what about the width of the touch sense?" [976-4 Pr.] "Gautama, the touch sense is said to be as wide as the body." [976-4 Ut.]

**Discussion:**

The two sutras (175-976) presented here, through the second and third external aspects, establish the proof of the external aspect (grossness) and width of the five senses. Why is the external aspect of all senses the same? All senses are as wide as an immeasurable fraction of an angula in comparison to their external aspect.

There is a doubt in this matter: "If the external aspect (grossness) of the touch sense is as wide as an immeasurable fraction of an angula, then why do we experience pain inside the body when a sword, knife, etc., strikes it?" The solution is that just as the object of the eye sense is form, and the object of the nose sense is smell, similarly the object of the touch sense is cold, etc., touch. But when a sword, knife, etc., strikes the body, it is not the pain of cold, etc., touch that is experienced in the body, but the pain of suffering. The soul experiences this suffering-like pain throughout the entire body, not just through the touch sense. For example, the pain of fever, etc., is experienced throughout the entire body. Drinking cold beverages (cold sherbet, etc.)...

Page #738:
---------------------------
15.]  "The reason why one experiences the sensation of cold within the body (from the *Prajñāpanā Sūtra*) is that the sense of touch extends throughout the entire body. Therefore, it is reasonable that one experiences the sensation of cold within the body because the sense of touch is present both within the skin and above the empty space." The extent of the senses - except for the sense of taste, the extent (vastness = expanse) of the remaining four senses is equal to an immeasurable fraction of an angula. The extent of the sense of taste is equal to the width of an angula, but here it is important to note that the extent (expanse) of the remaining four senses, except for the sense of touch, should be understood as an *ātma-angula*. Only the extent of the sense of touch should be understood as an *utsedha-angula*. 

Fourth-Fifth: How many regions and how deeply rooted? 977. [1] "So, venerable sir! How many regions is the sense of hearing said to have?" "Gautama! It is said to have infinite regions." [977-1] "Venerable sir! How many regions is the sense of hearing said to have?" [977-1] "Gautama! It is said to have infinite regions." [977-1] [2] "And so on, until the sense of touch." [977-2] 678. [1] "So, venerable sir! How many regions is the sense of hearing said to be deeply rooted in?" "Gautama! It is said to be deeply rooted in countless regions." [978-1] "Venerable sir! How many regions is the sense of hearing said to be deeply rooted in?" [978-1] "Gautama! It is said to be deeply rooted in countless regions." [978-1] [2] "And so on, until the sense of touch." [978-2] Discussion: Fourth-Fifth: How many regions and how deeply rooted? - The two present sūtras (977-978) explain which sense has how many regions and how deeply rooted it is in how many regions. 

From the perspective of depth, etc., which is less extensive? 676. "So, venerable sir! In terms of the depth of the sense of hearing, the sense of taste, the sense of smell, the sense of taste, and the sense of touch, which is less extensive, which is more extensive, which is equal, and which is more extensive in a particular way?" "Gautama! In terms of depth, the sense of hearing is countless times more extensive than the sense of taste, the sense of smell is countless times more extensive than the sense of taste, the sense of taste is countless times more extensive than the sense of touch, and the sense of touch is countless times more extensive than the sense of taste." 1. *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* Malay.

## Fifteenth Indriya Pada: Preya Uddeshak [153 Alpabahutva - Presentation]

These four sutras describe the perception, domain, and the relationship between perception and domain of the indriyas, as well as the alpabahutva (lesser-greater) of the indriyas in terms of their harsh-heavy and soft-light qualities.

**From the perspective of perception:**

* The chakshusindriya (eye) has the least number of domains of perception.
* The shrotrendriya (ear) has a number-fold greater perception than the chakshusindriya, as it perceives in a greater number of domains.
* The ghranendriya (nose) has a number-fold greater perception than the shrotrendriya, as it perceives in even more domains.
* The jihvendriya (tongue) has an innumerable-fold greater perception than the ghranendriya, as its extent is the width of an angula (finger), while the previous three indriyas (chakshu, shrotra, ghrana) each have an extent of an innumerable part of an angula.
* The sparshendriya (touch) has a number-fold greater perception than the jihvendriya, not an innumerable-fold greater, as the jihvendriya's extent is the width of two to nine angulas, while the sparshendriya is the size of the body. The body can be as large as a lakshya yojana (a unit of distance). How can it be innumerable-fold greater? Therefore, it is more logical to say that the sparshendriya has a number-fold greater perception than the jihvendriya.

**From the perspective of domains:**

* The alpabahutva should be understood in the same way as described above, in relation to the domains and the perception and domains.

**Alpabahutva of the harsh-heavy and soft-light qualities of the indriyas:**

* All five indriyas possess harshness, softness, heaviness, and lightness. Their alpabahutva is described here.
* The chakshu, shrotra, ghrana, jihva, and sparshendriya are infinitely-infinitely-fold greater in harsh-heavy qualities in that order.
* The same indriyas are described as infinitely-infinitely-fold greater in soft-light qualities in the reverse order.

**Simultaneous consideration of alpabahutva of harsh-heavy and soft-light qualities:**

* The soft-light qualities of the sparshendriya are described as infinitely-fold greater than its harsh-heavy qualities. This is because only a few upper domains of the body become harsh due to contact with cold, heat, etc., while many other domains remain soft. Therefore, the soft-light qualities of the sparshendriya are infinitely-fold greater than its harsh-heavy qualities.

Similarly, the (sense-related) vaktavya of the nāgakumāra to the stanitakumāras (should be understood). 985. [1] O Bhante! How many senses are established for the pṛthvīkāyika beings? Gotama! One tactile sense (only) is established. [985-2 O Bhante! What is the shape (saṁsthāna) of the tactile sense of the pṛthvīkāyika? Gotama!

## Translation:

**[160]** In the seventh and eighth chapters of the *Prajñapana Sutra*, the two sutras (990-991) discuss which sense organ perceives a *spruṣṭa* (contact) object and which perceives an *aspruṣṭa* (non-contact) object. Similarly, it is explained which sense organ perceives a *praviṣṭa* (entered) object and which perceives an *apraviṣṭa* (non-entered) object.

**Explanation of *spruṣṭa* and *aspruṣṭa*: **

* When an object comes into contact with a sense organ, like sand falling on the body, it is called *spruṣṭa*.
* An object that does not come into contact with a sense organ is called *aspruṣṭa*. For example, sounds (objects) that come into contact with the ear are *spruṣṭa*, but forms (objects) that do not come into contact with the eye are *aspruṣṭa*.

**Specific Explanation:**

This explanation also implies that the ear only perceives *spruṣṭa* sounds. Just as the nose, tongue, and skin perceive bound and *spruṣṭa* smells, tastes, and touches, the ear does not. This is because the objects of the nose, tongue, and skin are less subtle and fewer in number compared to sounds (words). Sound objects, being subtle and numerous, permeate the surrounding space and influence other sound objects, transforming them into different sound forms.

Therefore, sound objects, upon coming into contact with the sense organ, immediately enter the *nirvṛtti* (non-active) sense organ and manifest in the *upakarana* (instrument) sense organ (the power that perceives sound).

Furthermore, the ear is more adept at perceiving its object than the nose, tongue, and skin. Therefore, the ear perceives sounds merely upon contact, but it does not perceive sounds that are not in contact with the sense organ, as it is a *prāpya* (receiver) sense organ and its nature is to perceive *spruṣṭa* objects.

Although the original text states that "the nose smells *spruṣṭa* smells," it should be understood that it smells bound and *spruṣṭa* smells.

The *Āvaśyakaniryukti* states that the ear perceives *spruṣṭa* sounds, but the eye perceives *aspruṣṭa* forms. Similarly, the nose, tongue, and skin perceive their respective bound and *spruṣṭa* objects.

**Meaning of *spruṣṭa* and *bound*: **

* *Spruṣṭa* means coming into contact with the sense organ, while *bound* means having a strong connection with the sense organ.
* Objects become *spruṣṭa* merely by contact, but they become bound and *spruṣṭa* when they merge with the sense organ.

**Necessity of *bound* and *spruṣṭa* for perception:**

Smells, tastes, and touches need to be bound and *spruṣṭa* to be perceived because they are subtle, few in number, and do not influence other objects of their kind. Additionally, the nose, tongue, and skin are less powerful than the ear.

**Explanation of *praviṣṭa* and *apraviṣṭa*: **

The difference between *spruṣṭa* and *praviṣṭa* is that *spruṣṭa* is like sand falling on the body, while *praviṣṭa* is like a morsel entering the mouth. Therefore, there are two differences between them:

1. *Prajñapana Sutra* Commentary, page 298
2. "Listen to the sound, see the form, and then touch, but not the other way around. Smell, taste, and touch are bound and *viyāgara* (perceptible)." - *Āvaśyakaniryukti*
3. "Bound and *apīkya* (perceptible) are perceived by the senses." - *Prajñapana Sutra* Commentary, page 298

**[162] [Prajñāpāmasūtra Vivēcana - Ninth Topic (-Quantity) Door - The presented sūtra (992) explains in sequence how far the five senses have the least and the greatest capacity to perceive their respective objects? The capacity of the senses to perceive objects (1) The auditory sense can hear sounds coming from a distance of an infinitesimal part of an ātmāṅgula (a measure of length) at the least, and from a distance of 12 yojanas (a measure of distance) at the most, provided that the sounds are unbroken, i.e., uninterrupted, their continuity is not broken or scattered, their power is not obstructed by other sounds or wind, etc., and the sound-pudgalas are touched. The auditory sense cannot perceive untouched sounds. In addition, these sounds must enter the withdrawn sense. Sounds coming from a distance greater than this become faint and therefore are not audible. (2) The visual sense can see a form located at a distance of an infinitesimal part of an aṅgula at the least, and at a distance of one lakh yojanas at the most. But it can see a form that is unbroken (free from obstruction by a wall, etc.), untouched, and unentered by pudgalas. The eye does not have the power to see a form beyond this, even if there is no obstruction. The conclusion is that the auditory sense and the other four senses, being capable of acquiring, can perceive sound, smell, taste, and touch from a distance of an infinitesimal part of an aṅgula at the least, while the visual sense, being incapable of acquiring, can see an unbroken form located at a distance of an infinitesimal part of an aṅgula at the least, and cannot perceive a form closer than that, because it cannot even see very close things like collyrium, dust, and flour. The capacity of all the other senses to perceive objects is self-evident.**

Does a Chudmastha man know or perceive the otherness, diversity, inferiority (lowliness), or triviality, heaviness or lightness of those Nirjara-pudgalas? [994 Pr.] Gautama! This meaning (matter) is not possible. [Pr.] Bhagavan! For what reason is it said that a Chudmastha man does not know or perceive the otherness, diversity, inferiority, triviality, heaviness or lightness of those (Bhavitatma Anagar's Charamanirjara pudgalas)? [U.] (Not only man) even some (specific) Devas do not know or perceive the otherness, diversity, inferiority, triviality, heaviness or lightness of those Nirjara-pudgalas; O Gautama!

---------------------------
[164] 'The ultimate nirjara-pudgalas are those that are free from the transformation of karma, devoid of karma-paryaya, and are atoms (pudgalas).’ The reason for the rise of this question is that it was previously stated in this chapter that the four senses of hearing, etc., perceive the substances of sound, etc., which are tangible and enterable. In this situation, it is natural to ask whether the ultimate nirjara-pudgalas, which are pervasive throughout all realms, are not touched and entered by the senses of hearing, etc.? The second point is that this question is asked for the sake of the chhadmastha human being, because the kevali does not know or see through the senses, but knows and sees everything everywhere from all the praatma regions. The chhadmastha human being knows and sees through the senses that are cultivated by specific karmas related to the limbs and organs. Why is the chhadmastha human being unable to know and see the ultimate nirjara-pudgalas? - The human being who is chhadmastha, i.e., who is deficient in specific avadhi-jnana and kevala-jnana, cannot know or see the otherness of those nirjara-pudgalas (atoms) that are free from karma-paryaya at the end of the saileshi stage, i.e., these nirjara-pudgalas belong to such and such a shraman, these belong to such and such a shraman, and so on, and cannot know or see the various differences (nanaatva) of color, etc., in a single pudgala, and their inferiority, triviality (nisaaratva), heaviness (gurutva), and lightness (laghutva). Two main reasons have been given for this - one is that these pudgalas are so subtle that they are imperceptible and invisible to the sense paths of the eye, etc. The second reason is that these extremely subtle atomic pudgalas are pervading the entire realm, they are not in the form of clouds, therefore these senses cannot perceive them. Confirming this, the scripture writer says - the senses of the gods are much more adept at perceiving their objects than those of humans. Even a god who is deficient in avadhi-jnana related to karma-pudgalas cannot even slightly (jara-sa bhi) know or see the otherness, etc., of the ultimate nirjara-pudgalas of those bhavitatma anagaaras, then what to speak of the chhadmastha human being. / 2 Eleventh Grahaara-dvaar 665.

The meaning of the question and answer-The meaning of the present question is that the nature of the Pudgalas is to be transformed into various forms, therefore, when the appropriate material is available, the Nirjarapudgalas can also be transformed into the form of food. When they are transformed into the form of food, then do the Nairyikas eat that Nirjarapudgalas knowing and seeing them, or do they eat them without knowing and seeing them? The meaning of the answer given by Bhagavan is also of the same kind-They eat without knowing and seeing, because those Pudgalas (atoms) are extremely subtle and therefore invisible to the sense organs like eyes, etc., and the Nairyikas are devoid of the knowledge of Avadhijñāna which is capable of knowing the Karmanśarīrapudgalas. The meaning of the question and answer should be understood in the same way everywhere.' 1. Prajñāpanā. Malaya. Vṛtti, Patrāṅka 304 /

**Sanjnibhuta-prasanjibhuta Manusya** - Those who are Sanjnis are called Sanjnibhuta and those who are Asanjnis are called Asanjibhuta. Here, Sanjni means those Avadhijnani Manusyas whose Avadhijnana can know the Karman-pudgalas. Those Manusyas who are devoid of this type of Avadhijnana are called Asanjibhuta. Among these two types of Manusyas, those who are Sanjnibhuta, only those who have applied the Upayoga, know and see those Pudgalas and strike them. The remaining Asanjibhuta and Upayoga-shunya Sanjnibhuta Manusyas do not know or see those Pudgalas, they only consume them.

**Mayi-mithyashti-upapatrak and Pramayi-samyagdristi-upappannak-maya** is the third Kashaya. By its acceptance, one should accept the acceptance of all other Kashayas by inference. Those in whom the Maya-kashaya exists are called Mayos, meaning those who are intensely attached to Raga-dvesha.

**Mayos (Sakashayas)** who are Mithyadrishtis are called Mayi-mithyadrishtis. Those (Vaimanik Devas) who are born (Upannna hue hon) in the form of Mayi-mithyadrishtis are called Mayi-mithyadrishti-upappannak. Those who are opposite to them are Amayi-samyagdristi-upappannak.

According to the Siddhanta, Mayi-mithyadrishti-upappannak can be found in Devas up to the ninth Graveyaka. Although there are Samyagdristi Devas in the Praveyakas and before them in the Kalpas, their Avadhijnana is not so intense that they can know and see those Nirjara-pudgalas. Therefore, they are also considered to be within the Mayi-mithyadrishti-upappannak. Those who are Amayi-samyagdristi-upappannak are the Anuttaravimanas Devas.

**Anantaropappannak and Parampuropappannak** - Those who have just been born are called Anantaropappannak Devas, and those who have been born for more than one time are called Parampuropappannak. Among these two types of Pramayi-samyagdristi-upappannak Devas, the Anantaropappannak Devas cannot know and see the Nirjara-pudgalas, only the Parampuropappannak and among them, only the Upayogayukta Devas can know and see the Nirjara-pudgalas. Those who are Aparayaptaka and Upayogarahita cannot know and see them, they only consume them.

The meaning of "consume" here should be understood as "consume" in the sense of "Lomahar" everywhere.

[168] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra [2] and in the same way (as it has been said in relation to the mirror) according to that very statement, in order, the asi (sword), maṇi (jewel), udapāna (milk and water), tella (oil), phāṇiya (molasses) and vasa (fat) (should be stated in the statement-statement). The presentation from the twelfth ideal gate to the eighteenth vasa gate - the present sūtra (666) presents the seven statements related to the eye sense in relation to the appearance etc. What does the seer of the mirror etc. see? - The man seeing the mirror, sword, jewel, water, milk, oil, molasses and (melted) fat, what does he actually see? This is the question. The scholars say - he sees the mirror etc. and the reflection of his body, but he does not see the soul, i.e. his body, because his body remains in itself, not in the mirror; then how can he see his body? What he (the seer) sees as a reflection is shadow-pudgala-like, because all sense-objects are gross objects with rays and the dharma of increase and decrease. Rays are in the form of shadow-pudgala, every being has the perception of the shadow of all gross objects. The meaning is that the shadow-atoms of the man which are transmitted into the mirror and become transformed into the colour and form of his own body, their attainment is there, not of the body / They (shadow-atoms) are used by the word reflection. 'Prahai pehati' and 'no addaiṁ pehati' thus there is a difference in the text here. Different teachers have also supported their own accepted texts.

**Explanation:** The nineteenth and twentieth Kambladvara-Sthanadvara-prastuta sutras discuss the touching of space and the occupation of space by a blanket and a pillar respectively. Both these dvaras present questions and answers related to the perception of non-sensory objects. Their meaning is as follows: (1) Does a blanket, when folded, occupy the same amount of space as when it is unfolded? The answer of the Bhagavan is yes. (2) Does a pillar, when standing upright, occupy the same amount of space as when it is lying down? The Bhagavan also gave an affirmative answer to this question.

**[1003-2]**  Just as it has been said about the external Pushkarardha, so also, from the Sayambhuramana-samudra up to the Praddhasamaya, it should be understood that there is no contact. **[1003-2]**  Similarly, regarding the Lavana-samudra, Dhataki-khanda-dvipa, Kaloda-samudra, Abhyantara Pushkarardha and Bahya Pushkarardha (dvipa), the same understanding should be applied (as per the previous explanation, from Dharma-astikaya to Adha-samaya, regarding the concept of contact and non-contact).  The key point is that from the Bahya Pushkarardha onwards, the oceans and islands are not in contact with the Adha-samaya.  Up to the Sayambhuramana-samudra, the same understanding should be applied.  This sequence (of islands and oceans) should be understood according to these verses.

**1721** [The *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* clearly states that the *ākāśāstikāya* is pervasive in its regions; (but) it is not pervasive in the *pṛthvīkāya*, nor is it pervasive in the *praddhā-samaya* (time-substance). / *Alok* is a region of non-living substance, it is very subtle, it is combined with infinite subtle qualities, it is less than the infiniteth part of the entire *ākāśa* (excluding *lokākāśa*, the entire *ākāśa* is a measure). The twenty-first, twenty-second, twenty-third, and twenty-fourth *thiggal*-island-ocean-world-alok-door-present four sūtras (Sū. 1002 to 1005) describe the pervasiveness and non-pervasiveness of the *ākāśa* form of *thiggal*, island-ocean, world, and *alok* from the *dharmaāstikāya* to the *praddhā-samaya*. The pervasiveness and non-pervasiveness of the *ākāśa* *thiggal* should be understood as the *ākāśa* *thiggal* from the review-'*thiggal*' word here. / The entire *ākāśa* is like a vast sheet. In the middle of it, the world appears like the *thiggal* (binding) of that vast sheet. / Therefore, the *lokākāśa* is called *thiggal*. / The first general question is - how is this *ākāśa* *thiggal* form of *lokākāśa* pervasive? Then, in a specific way, it is asked how many *kāyas* are pervasive from the *dharmaāstikāya* to the *traskāya*, even up to the ' *praddhā-samaya*'? The world is pervasive in the entire *dharmaāstikāya*, because the entire *dharmaāstikāya* is completely immersed in the world, therefore it is not pervasive in the region of the *dharmaāstikāya*, because what is completely immersed in something cannot be said to be immersed in one of its regions, but the world is pervasive in the regions of the *dharmaāstikāya*; because all the regions of the *dharmaāstikāya* are immersed in the world. / The same thing should be understood in the case of the *adharmaāstikāya*; but the world is not pervasive in the entire *ākāśāstikāya*, because the world is only a small part of the entire *ākāśāstikāya*, but it is pervasive in the region and regions of the *ākāśāstikāya*, as far as the *pudgalāstikāya*, the *jīvāstikāya*, and the *pṛthvīkāya* to the *vanaspatikāya*. / The subtle *pṛthvīkāya* etc. are pervasive in the entire world. / Therefore, it is also completely pervasive by them, but it is sometimes pervasive by the *traskāya*, sometimes it is not. / When the *kevali* performs *samudghāta*, then in the fourth time they pervade the entire world from their own *prātm* regions. / The *kevali* *bhagavān* is only within the *sakāya*, therefore at that time the entire world is pervasive in the *traskāya*. Apart from this, at other times the entire world is not pervasive in the *traskāya*. / Because living beings are only found in the *trasanāḍī*. Which is only one *rāju* wide and fourteen *rāju* high. / The *praddhā-samaya* pervades some part of the world and some part is not pervasive. / The *praddhā-kāla* is only in two and a half islands, not beyond. / Difference between ' *ākāśa* *thiggal*' and 'world' - First the world was described by the word ' *ākāśa* *thiggal*', now the same is described by the word 'world' in general. / Therefore, there is a difference between specific and general. / The description related to 'world' is the same as ' *ākāśa* *thiggal*'. / / Fifteenth *indriyapada*: First *uddeśaka* ends. / / 1. *Prajñāpanā*. *Malay*. *Vṛtti*, page number 307-305.

## The Fifteenth Indriya-pada: The Second Uddesaka [175 [2]

**[175 [2]  &  3 //  [1010-2]]**  One should speak about the time of the cessation of the senses of the Nairyikas up to the Vaimanikas. In the first of the two sutras presented here, the second and third cessation-gates and the time of cessation-gates are discussed. The first sutra describes five types of cessation, and the second sutra describes the time of cessation of each sense. The meaning of cessation is the creation of the form of external and internal cessation.

**[1011. [1]  &  [1011-1 प्र.]**  O Bhagavan! How many types of Indriya-labdhi are described? **[1011-1 उ.]**  Gautama! Indriya-labdhi is described as being of five types. They are: Shrotrendriya-labdhi up to Sparshendriya-labdhi.

**[1011-2] &  4 //**  Similarly, one should describe the Indriya-labdhi of the Nairyikas up to the Vaimanikas.  It is important to note that one should describe as many Indriya-labdhi as there are Indriyas.

## Fifteenth Indriya-pada: Second Uddeshaka

[177 Vivacana-Chaturtha-Panchama-Shashtha Landhidvara, Upayaddhadvara and Alpbahutvadvara - These three sutras present the destruction and pacification of Indriyaravarakarma, the time of use of the senses, and the scarcity or abundance of the time of use of the senses, respectively, through the Landhidvara, Upayaddhadvara, and Upayaddhavisheshadhikdvara. The meaning of the terms Indriyalabdhi, etc. - the destruction and pacification of Indriyaravarakarma is called Indriyalabdhi, the time of use (being engaged in use) of the senses is called Indriy Upayaddha, and the scarcity or abundance of Upayaddha is called Upayaddhavisheshadhik.]

Seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth, respectively, are Indriya-Avgraharan-Avay-Iha-Avgraha Dvara 1014. [1] How many types of Indriya-Avgraharan are there, Bhagavan? [1014-1 U.] Gautama! Five types of Indriya-Avgraharan are said. They are as follows - Shrotrendriya-Avgraharan to Sparshendriya-Avgraharan. [1014-2] Similarly, from Narakas to Vaimanikas (it should be said as before). The special point is that for whoever has as many senses, (it should be understood that they have that many Avgraharans). 7 / 1015. [1] How many types of Indriya-Avay are there, Bhagavan? [1015-1 U.] Gautama! Five types of Indriya-Avay are said. They are as follows - Shrotrendriya-Avay (to) Sparshendriya-Avay. [1015-2] Similarly, from Nairyakas to Vaimanikas (it should be said regarding Avay). The special point is that for whoever has as many senses, it should be said that they have that many Avays. 8 / 1016. [1] How many types of Iha are there, Bhagavan? [1016-1 U.] Gautama!

It is as follows - Shrotrendriyaavgraha, Ghrnaendriyaavgraha, Jihvendriyaavgraha and Sparshendriyaavgraha / 1016. Bhante! How many types are there in Arthaavgraha? Gotama! Arthaavgraha has been said to be of six types. It is as follows - Shrotrendriya-Arthaavgraha, Chakshurindriya-Arthaavgraha, Ghrnaendriya-Arthaavgraha, Jihvendriya-Arthaavgraha, Sparshendriya-Arthaavgraha and Noindriya (mind)-Arthaavgraha / 1020. [1] Bhante! How many Avgrahas are said for the Raiyaanas? Gotama!

Page #767:
---------------------------
## Fifteenth Indriya Pada: Second Uddeshaka [179 [1020-2] Similarly, one should say (regarding the avagraha) from Asurakumars to Stanitakumars. 1021. [1] "Bhagavan! How many avagrahas are said for Prithvikaayikas?" "Gautama! Two types of avagrahas are said for them / They are as follows: Arthaavagraha and Vajanavagraha / [1021-1 Pra.] "Bhagavan!

[4] Similarly, one should say (regarding the Vajanavagraha and Arthaavagraha) from Apkaayikas to Vanaspatikaayikas. 1022. [1] Similarly, one should understand regarding the avagraha of Dviindriyas / Specifically, two types of Vajanavagrahas are said for Dviindriyas, and two types of Arthaavagrahas are also said for them. [1022-1] Similarly, one should understand regarding the avagraha of Dviindriyas / Specifically, two types of Vajanavagrahas are said for Dviindriyas, and two types of Arthaavagrahas are also said for them. [2] Similarly, one should understand regarding the (Vajanavagraha and Arthaavagraha) of Triindriya and Chaturindriya beings / Specifically, with the increase of each Indriya, one should say that there is an increase in each Vajanavagraha and Arthaavagraha. Three types of Vajanavagrahas are said for Chaturindriya beings, and four types of Arthaavagrahas are said for them.

---------------------------
[180] [Prashapanasutra 1023. Just as in the case of the Nairyaikas (Su. 1020 [1]), so also should one understand the Pravagrah of all the remaining beings, up to the Vaimanikas.  // 10 //  [1023]  // 10 //  Discussion - In the seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth sutras (Su. 1014 to 1023), which are presented through the ten Indriya-Pravagrahana-Pravaya-Iha-Pravagrahdwaras, the subject of the Avagrahana, Avaya, Iha and Avagraha of the Indriyas has been discussed through the four doors respectively.  /  The meaning of Indriyavagrahana - The general perception (knowledge) that takes place through the Indriyas is called Indriyavagraha or Indriyavagrahana.  /  Explanation of Indriyavaya - The determination that arises from the knowledge of Avagraha and the knowledge of Iha, which is the form of the decision, is called Avaya or 'Apaya'. For example, this is the sound of the conch shell, or this is the tone of the sarangi, etc.  /  The meaning is that in the use of knowledge, first comes the knowledge of Avagraha; which makes the other general the object.  /  After that, the knowledge of Iha arises, by which the use of knowledge goes beyond the general dharma and becomes inclined to take hold of the special dharma.  /  After Iha, there is the knowledge of Avaya, which determines the special dharma of the object.  /  The knowledge of Avagraha etc. takes place through the mind as well as through the Indriyas, but here the questions and answers are only in relation to the Pravagrah etc. that takes place through the Indriyas.  /  Explanation of Iha-knowledge - The effort in the form of the consideration of the Sadbhut substance is called Iha. Iha-knowledge takes place after Avagraha and before Avaya. This (Iha-knowledge) is inclined to take hold of the special dharma of the substance and to reject the special meaning of the Asadbhut. For example, here the dharma of the sound of the conch shell, etc., such as sweetness, etc., is being obtained, but the dharma of the sound of the sarangi, etc., such as harshness, cruelty, etc., is not being obtained, therefore this sound must be of the conch shell.  /  This type of special Mati is called Iha.  /  The meaning of Pravagrah and Vyanjanavagraha is Avagraha, i.e., the general dharma of the meaning that cannot be expressed by words is called Pravagrah. The meaning of the general form that is not designated, without any special form, etc., is called Avagraha. For example, the knowledge that arises first when the touch of a straw is felt, 'this is something', this type of knowledge.  /  Just as a pot is expressed by a lamp, so also that by which the meaning is expressed is called Vyanjan. The meaning is that the Indriyas like the Shrotrendriya are able to express the objects like sound, etc., only when there is a mutual relationship between the Dravyendriya in the form of an instrument and the Dravyas that have transformed into the form of sound, etc., otherwise not. Therefore, the relationship between the Indriya and its object is called Vyanjan. Thus, the definition of Vyanjanavagraha is of three types - the relationship between the instrument Indriya and its object is called Vyanjan. The instrument Indriya is also called Vyanjan and the object like sound, etc., which is to be expressed, is also called Vyanjan.  /  The meaning is that after the use of Darshan, the very indistinct perception (knowledge) is Vyanjanavagraha. It has been said earlier that the mutual relationship between the instrument Dravyendriya and the Dravyas that have transformed into the form of sound, etc., is Vyanjanavagraha, from this point of view, only four Prapyakari Indriyas are such,

Page #769:

## Fifteenth Indriya Pada: Second Uddeshaka [181]

The relationship between the sense organs and their objects is not the same for all. The eye and mind are both incapable of grasping their objects, therefore they do not have a relationship with their objects. This is why there are four types of Vyanjanavagraha and six types of Arthavagraha. Why is there an inversion in Vyanjanavagraha and Arthavagraha? Vyanjanavagraha arises first, and Arthavagraha arises later. In this situation, why is the statement of Arthavagraha, which occurs later, made first? The solution is that Arthavagraha is relatively clear in nature, and because it is clear in nature, everyone can understand it. For this reason, the statement of Arthavagraha is made first. In addition, Arthavagraha occurs through all the senses and the mind, and for this reason, it is also mentioned first. Vyanjanavagraha is not like that. It does not occur through the eye and mind, and because it is extremely unclear in nature, it does not come to the perception of everyone. Therefore, its statement is made later.

## Eleventh Dravya Indriya Dvara 1024

**[1024 Pr.]**  O Bhagavan! How many types of Indriyas are there? 
**[1024 U.]**  Gautama! Indriyas are said to be of two types. They are Dravya Indriya and Bhava Indriya.

**[1025 Pr.]**  O Bhagavan! How many Dravya Indriyas are there?
**[1025 U.]**  Gautama! Dravya Indriyas are said to be of eight types. They are: two Shrotras (ears), two Netras (eyes), two Ghranas (noses), Jihva (tongue), and Sparshan (touch).

**Discussion:** The perception of bound and rewarded Dravya Indriyas of the twenty-four Dandakas is presented under the eleventh Dwar. From the Nairyaikas to the Vaimanikas, the past bound and rewarded Dravya Indriyas of all beings are presented in various aspects like oneness, multiplicity, etc.

**The nature of perception, etc.:** The meaning of past is the Dravya Indriyas of the past, the meaning of bound is the Dravya Indriyas obtained in the present, and the meaning of rewarded is the Dravya Indriyas to be obtained in the future.

**Presentation of perception, etc. in four aspects:** (1) Presentation of the past bound and rewarded Dravya Indriyas of each Nairyaika to each Sarvarthasiddha Deva, (2) Presentation of the past, etc. Dravya Indriyas of many Nairyaikas to many Sarvarthasiddha Devas, (3) Presentation of the past, etc. Dravya Indriyas from the form of Nairyaikatva to Sarvarthasiddhatva of each Nairyaika to Sarvarthasiddha Deva, and (4) Presentation of the past, etc. Dravya Indriyas from the form of Nairyaikatva to Sarvarthasiddhadevatva of many Nairyaikas to Sarvarthasiddha Devas.

**Rewarded Dravya Indriyas of one Nairyaika:** The rewarded Dravya Indriyas related to each being are eight, sixteen, many, countable, uncountable, or infinite. They are as follows:

* The one who will become a Siddha after attaining the human Paryaya in the next birth, having been a Naraka, will have Dravya Indriyas related to his human birth.
* The one who will be born in the five-sense Tiryach Yoni after leaving Naraka and then attain Siddhahood after attaining the human path, will have sixteen Dravya Indriyas, combining the Tiryach birth and human birth.
* The one who will be born in the five-sense Tiryach after leaving Naraka, then be born in the one-sense body, and then attain Siddhahood after attaining the human birth, will have seventeen Dravya Indriyas, combining the eight Dravya Indriyas of the five-sense Tiryach birth, one of the one-sense birth, and the human birth.
* The one who will wander in the cycle of births for a countable period will have countable Dravya Indriyas, the one who will wander for an uncountable period will have uncountable Dravya Indriyas, and the one who will wander in the cycle of births for an infinite period will have infinite rewarded Dravya Indriyas.

**Rewarded Dravya Indriyas of a human:** Some humans have rewarded Dravya Indriyas, while others do not. Those who attain Siddhahood in the same birth do not have them, while the rest have them. If they have them, they are 8, 16, countable, uncountable, or infinite. If he becomes a human again in the next birth, ...

##  Translation:

**202]  **If the *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* is proven, it has eight *dravyaindriyas* (sense organs). A human who, after one existence in the *pṛthvīkāya* (earth body) etc., becomes a human and attains *siddhi* (liberation), has six *indriyas* (senses).  The remaining *bhāvanā* (understanding) should be understood as before.

**The *dravyaindriyas* of the *asurakumāras* (demigods) who are rewarded:**  An *asurakumāra* who, after leaving the *asurakumāra* existence, attains humanhood and becomes a *siddha* (liberated being), has eight rewarded *dravyaindriyas*.  

**From *īśāna* (the highest god) to each *asurakumāra* etc., born in the *pṛthvīkāya*, *apkāya* (water body) and *vanaspatikāya* (plant body), who is born in one of the *pṛthvīkāya* etc. in the next existence, and then attains humanhood and becomes a *siddha*, has nine rewarded *indriyas*.**  The understanding of *saṃkhyāta* (countable) etc. should be understood as before.

**The *dravyaindriyas* of the *pṛthvī*, *ap* and *vanaspatikāya* who are rewarded:**  The *pṛthvīkāya* etc. who die and are born as humans in the next existence and become *siddhas*, have eight *indriyas* related to their human existence in the next existence.  Those *pṛthvīkāya* etc. who, after one existence as *pṛthvīkāya* etc., become humans and attain *siddhi*, have six *indriyas*.

**The *dravyaindriyas* of the *tejaskaayika* (fire body) and *vāyukaayika* (air body) and those with impaired senses:**  The *tejaskaayika* and *vāyukaayika* do not attain humanhood after death.  The *dvīndriya* (two-sensed), *trīndriya* (three-sensed) and *caturindriya* (four-sensed) beings can attain humanhood in the next existence, but cannot attain *siddhi*. Therefore, their *jighanya* (inferior) *indriyas* should be said to be nine each.  The remaining *praroopaṇā* (description) should be understood according to what was said before.

**The *dravyaindriyas* of the *sanatkumāra* etc. who are rewarded:**  The *sanatkumāra* etc. gods do not die and are born in the *pṛthvīkāya* etc., but are born in the *pañcendriya* (five-sensed) beings. Therefore, their statement should be understood like that of the *nairāyika* (those who do not believe in the existence of the soul).

**The *dravyaindriyas* of the *vijaya* etc. four who are rewarded:**  The one who attains humanhood and becomes a *siddha* in the next existence has eight *indriyas*.  The one who becomes a human once and then attains humanhood again and becomes a *siddha* has sixteen *indriyas*.  The one who experiences godhood in between and then becomes a human and attains *siddhi* has twenty-four *indriyas*.  Eight in the human existence, eight in the god existence, and eight again in the human existence, making a total of twenty-four *indriyas*.

**The *vijaya* etc. four *vimāna* (celestial palace) gods do not stay in the world for a long, immeasurable or infinite time.**  Therefore, their future *dravyaindriyas* are said to be countable, not immeasurable or infinite.

**The *dravyaindriyas* of the *sarvārthasiddha* (all-accomplished) god who is rewarded:**  The *sarvārthasiddha* *vimāna* gods regularly become *siddhas* in the next existence. Therefore, their future *dravyaindriyas* are said to be eight.

**The *dravyaindriyas* of many humans who are bound:**  They are sometimes countable and sometimes immeasurable.  The reason for this is that sometimes there is a complete absence of *sammūcchima* (those who are in a state of deep sleep) humans. Their interval is twenty-four *muhūrta* (moments). When there are no *sammūcchima* humans at all, the bound *dravyaindriyas* of humans are countable, because the humans born from the womb are countable. But when there are also *sammūcchima* humans, the bound *dravyaindriyas* are immeasurable.

**The future *dravyaindriyas* of the *nāraka* (hell beings) in their *nāraka* existence:**  Some *nāraka* have future *dravyaindriyas*, while others do not.  The *nāraka* who leaves hell and is never born again in the *nāraka* state does not have future *dravyaindriyas*.  The *nāraka* who is born again in hell has future *dravyaindriyas*.

## The Fifteenth Indriya-pada: The Second Uddeshaka

There are 203. If it is generated only once, then there are eight, if it is generated twice in the Narakas, then there are sixteen, if it is generated thrice, then there are twenty-four, if it is generated a countable number of times, then there are a countable number, and if it is generated an uncountable or infinite number of times, then the future Dravya-indriyas are also uncountable or infinite respectively.

One Naraka has infinite past Dravya-indriyas, as perceived in the Earth-body. There are no bound Dravya-indriyas, because it is not possible for the present Naraka to be present in the form of an Earth-body in the Naraka-bhava. Therefore, there are no bound Dravya-indriyas.

The perceived Dravya-indriyas of the five Anuttaropapatik Devas, Vijaya, etc., are such that a being who is born once in the Vijaya, etc., Vimanas, is not born again in the Narakas, Tiryanch-panchendriyas, Vanavyantaras, and Jyotishkas. Therefore, the Naraka, etc., related Dravya-indriyas are not possible in them.

There are no past and bound Dravya-indriyas in the form of Sarvarthasiddha Devas. A Naraka being has never been a Sarvarthasiddha being in the past. Therefore, its Dravya-indriyas in the form of Sarvarthasiddha-devatva are impossible.

After being born once in the Sarvarthasiddha Vimana, the being attains Siddhi after obtaining the human birth.

The future Dravya-indriyas of the Vanaspatikayikas in the form of Vijaya, etc., are infinite, because the Vanaspatikayika beings are infinite.

The bound Dravya-indriyas should be known as uncountable in their own place, except for humans and Sarvarthasiddha Devas. There are no bound Dravya-indriyas in other places. Because a being who is present in a particular bhava cannot be present in another bhava.

The bound Dravya-indriyas of the Vanaspatikayikas are uncountable, because the Audarik bodies of the Vanaspatikayikas are uncountable.

**206]** The bound sense organs are five in number, while the rewarded sense organs are present in some and absent in others. For those who have them, they are five, ten, fifteen, countable, uncountable, or infinite in number. Similarly, one should describe the past, present, and future sense organs of each Nairyika, starting from the state of being an Asura-Kumar and ending with the state of being a Stanita-Kumar. The special point is that it does not have bound sense organs. 

**1066. [1]** From the state of being a Prithvi-Kaya to the state of being a Dvi-Indriya, one should describe the past, present, and future sense organs of each Nairyika, just like the Dravya-Indriyas. **[1066-2]** Similarly, one should describe the state of being a Tri-Indriya. The special point is that its rewarded sense organs are three, six, nine, countable, uncountable, or infinite in number. **[1066-3]** Similarly, one should describe the state of being a Chatur-Indriya. The special point is that its rewarded sense organs are four, eight, twelve, countable, uncountable, or infinite in number.

**1067.** Thus, these four Gamas (stages of existence) should be understood here, as described in relation to the Dravya-Indriyas. In the third Gama (human existence), one should understand that the number of rewarded sense organs is equal to the number of bound sense organs. In the fourth Gama (divine existence), just as the Dravya-Indriyas are present in all the Sarvartha-Siddh, how many sense organs are present in the state of being a Sarvartha-Siddh? "None." The bound sense organs are countable, but the rewarded sense organs are not. This is what should be said.

These Sutras describe the oneness and multiplicity of beings from Nairyika to Sarvartha-Siddh, and the past, present, and future sense organs of each being from the state of being a Nairyika to the state of being a Sarvartha-Siddh, based on their respective states. The rewarded (Bhava) sense organs of a Naraka in the state of being a Naraka are present in some and absent in others.

This is the sixteenth *prayogapada* of the *Prathamika Prajnapana Sutra*. The activity of the soul based on mind, speech, and body is called *prayoga*. From this perspective, this *pada* is important. If there is no soul, then there cannot be a specific action of these three. According to Jain terminology, these three are made of *pudgala*. The general activity (*gati*) of *pudgalas* can happen even without the soul, but when *pudgalas* transform into mind, speech, and body, then their specific activity happens with the cooperation of the soul. The transformation of *pudgalas* into mind, etc., is also subject to the karma of the soul, therefore their activity can be called *atmavyapaar*. All aspects of this *prayog* in the form of *atmavyapaar* are discussed here.

This *pada* presents two main topics: (1) *prayoga*, its types, and the classification of *prayogas* in the twenty-four *dandakas*, and (2) the five types of *gatiprapaat* and their subtypes and nature.

There are fifteen types of *prayoga*: four *manoprayogas* (mental activities) like truthfulness, four *vacanaprayogas* (speech activities) like non-violence, and seven *audarik* (physical activities) like *audarik* mixed with *praad* (physical activities with external objects). Then, the classification of how many *prayogas* are found in different groups of beings and in the twenty-four *dandakas* is presented.

After that, the classification of how many *prayogas* are found in the beings of the twenty-four *dandakas* with multiple specificities (*bahutva-vishist*) is presented. Also, the classification of how many options of single, double, triple, and quadruple combinations (*ekasanyogi, dwikasanyogi, trikasanyogi, and chatuhsanyogi*) are found in relation to oneness and multiplicity (*ekatva-bahutva*) is presented.

After the discussion of the fifteen types of *prayogas*, the *gatiprapaat* (*gatipravaad*) is explained. From *sutra* 1086 to 1123, the discussion of *gati* is presented, which is related to *prayoga*. In the chapter called *gatiprapaat*, the five types of *gati* are explained by collecting all the activities related to *gati*: *prayogagati*, *tatgati*, *bandhanchhedangati*, *upapaatgati*, and *vihayogati*.

16th Experimental Aspect [211] - The trees in the forest are of various types such as peepal, khair, palash, ashoka, etc., but since there is an abundance of ashoka trees, it may be thought that this is an 'Ashokavana' (Ashoka forest). This belief is true to some extent, as there are indeed some ashoka trees present, but it is not entirely true, as there are also other large trees like peepal, etc. in the forest. From the perspective of the Vyavahara Naya (Empirical Viewpoint), this belief is considered Satyasatya (both true and false), but from the Paramartha Naya (Absolute Viewpoint), it is considered untrue, as the object (the forest) is not perceived as it truly is.

(4) Prasatyamrisha-mana-prayoga - This is a mental activity that is neither completely true nor completely false. When there is a doubt or controversy, one tries to determine the true nature of the object according to the views of the Omniscient. For example, the thought "the soul exists, and it is both real and unreal" is a Prasatyamrisha-mana-prayoga, as it is defined as true. However, the thought "the soul does not exist" or "the soul is eternally permanent" is a Viraddhaka (contradictory) Prasatyamrisha-mana-prayoga, as it goes against the views of the Omniscient. Even without the intention to establish the true nature of the object, a contemplation that is merely focused on the object's form is also considered a Prasatyamrisha-mana-prayoga, such as the thought "I need to get a pot from Devadatta" or "I need to ask someone for a cow." This contemplation is neither completely true nor completely false, as it is merely a consideration of the object's form. From the Vyavahara Naya perspective, this is called Asatyabhusa (apparent falsehood). If such contemplation is done with the intention to deceive or cheat, it falls under the category of Asatya (falsehood); otherwise, a simple contemplation on the nature of the object is considered within the realm of Satya (truth).

(5-8) Just as there are four types of mental activities (Mana-prayoga), there are also four types of verbal activities (Vak-prayoga), the difference being that in the former, it is the mind that is engaged, while in the latter, it is the speech. These four are: (5) Satyavak-prayoga (truthful speech), (6) Asatyavak-prayoga (untruthful speech), (7) Satyamrisha-vak-prayoga (speech that is both true and false), and (8) Asatyamrisha-vak-prayoga (speech that is neither true nor false).

(8) Audarikaśarīra-kāya-prayoga - The characteristics of the Audārika (gross physical) body have been described earlier. The term 'Kāya' refers to the aggregate of pudgalas (matter-particles) or the accumulation of bones, etc. A body that is gross and large is called an Audārika Śarīra, and the activity associated with such a body is called Audārika Śarīra Kāya-prayoga. This occurs in Tiryañca (animals) and Paryāpta (fully developed) human beings.

(10) Audārika-miśra-śarīra-kāya-prayoga - A body that is Audārika (gross physical) and is mixed with the Kārmaṇa (karmic) body is called Audārika-miśra Śarīra. The activity associated with such a body is called Audārika-miśra Śarīra Kāya-prayoga. Even though the body has both Audārika and Kārmaṇa components, it is called Audārika-miśra and not Kārmaṇa-miśra, for three reasons: (1) the Audārika aspect is predominant in its origin, (2) it is Kādācitka (occasional), and (3) it serves the purpose of indicating the desired object without any doubt. Therefore, when a human being, a Pañcendriya Tiryañca (five-sensed animal), or a Paryāpta Bādara Vāyukāyika (fully developed gross air-bodied) being, endowed with Vaikriya (transformational) attainment, performs Vaikriya activities, it is called Audārika-miśra and not Vaikriya-miśra, due to the primacy and predominance of the Audārika body. Similarly, when a Caturdasapūrvadharī (possessor of fourteen Pūrvas) Muni, endowed with Āhārika (transformational) attainment, creates an Āhārika body, even though it is a mixture of Audārika and Āhārika, it is called Audārika-miśra due to the predominance of the Audārika aspect.

(11) Vaikriya-śarīra-kāya-prayoga - The activity associated with the Vaikriya (transformational) body is called Vaikriya-śarīra-kāya-prayoga. This occurs in Paryāpta (fully developed) beings endowed with Vaikriya Śarīra Paryāpti (transformational body attainment).

(12) Vaikriya-miśra-śarīra-kāya-prayoga - This refers to the activity associated with the Kārmaṇa (karmic) body mixed with the Vaikriya (transformational) body, which occurs in the Aparyāpta (undeveloped) state of devas and narakas.

**212]** **[Prajñāpanasūtra: Usage of the Vaikriya Body]** / When a five-sensed Tiryancha, human, or air-bodied being, having become a Vaikriya-bodied being, completes its task and desires to abandon the Vaikriya body and enter the Audārika body, then due to the power of the Vaikriya body, it is inclined to adopt the Audārika-śarīrakāya-yoga. Because the Vaikriya body is dominant, it is not called "Audārika-miśra" but "Vaikriya-miśra-śarīrakāya-prayoga." / **(13)** **Prāhārak-śarīrakāya-prayoga:** The usage by the Prāhārak body of a fourteen-fold Prāhārak body, which has obtained sufficient food from the Prāhārak body. / **(14)** **Prāhārak-miśra-śarīrakāya-prayoga:** When a Prāhārak-bodied, restrained Muni, having completed his task, again takes on the Audārika body, then due to the strength of the Prāhārak body, he enters the Audārika body. Because the Prāhārak body is dominant, it is not called "Audārika-miśra-śarīra" but "Prāhārak-miśra-śarīra." / This type of usage is called "Prāhārak-miśra-śarīrakāya-prayoga." **(15)** **Kārmaṇa-śarīrakāya-prayoga:** The usage that occurs during the disintegration process and in the third, fourth, and fifth stages of the Kevali-samudghāta is called "Kārmaṇa-śarīrakāya-prayoga."

[214] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra 1075. A human asked: "Gautama! How many types of practices are there for humans?" [1075 A.] "Gautama! There are fifteen types of practices for them. They are as follows: from Satyamanaḥprayoga to Karmāṇśarīrakāyaprayoga." 1076. "The practices of the Vāṇavyantara, Jyotiṣka, and Vaimānika gods are similar to those of the Nairāyikas (as mentioned in Sūtra 1070)." [1076] In the eight Sūtras (from Sūtra 1069 to 1076), the practices of the Samuccaya Jīvas and the twenty-four Daṇḍakas are presented. How many practices are there in the Samuccaya Jīvas? This is what is being presented. Conclusion: There are fifteen practices in the Samuccaya Jīvas, because fifteen practices are always found in relation to the various Jīvas. There are eleven practices in the Nairāyikas, Vyantara, Jyotiṣka, and Vaimānika, because they do not have the Audārika, Praudārikamiśra, Āhārak, and Āhārakamiśra practices. Except for the Vāyukāyikas, the remaining four stationary beings, starting with the Pṛthvīkāyas, have three practices: Audārika, Audārikamiśra, and Karmāṇśarīrakāyaprayoga. In addition to these three, the Vāyukāyikas also have the Vaikriya and Vaikriyamiśraśarīrakāyaprayoga. Each of the two, three, and four-sense Jīvas has four practices: Asatyāmṛṣābhashāprayoga, Audārika, Audārikamiśra, and Karmāṇśarīrakāyaprayoga. The five-sense Tiryañcas have thirteen practices, excluding the Prāhārak and Āhārakamiśra, while humans have fifteen practices. The presentation of practices based on the division of the Samuccaya Jīvas: 1077. "Bhagavan! Which Jīvas are Satyamanaḥprayogī, and which are Karmāṇśarīrakāyaprayogī?" "Gautama! All Jīvas are Satyamanaḥprayogī, and they are also Veibhaviyamiśraśarīrakāyaprayogī, Karmāṇśarīrakāyaprayogī, Āhāragasarīrakāyaprayogī, Prāhāragasarīrakāyaprayogī, Āhāragamosasarīrakāyaprayogī, and Prāhāragamosasarīrakāyaprayogī. There are eight categories of Jīvas: 1. Prāhāragasarīrakāyaprayogī, Prāhāragamosasarīrakāyaprayogī. 2. Prāhāragasarīrakāyaprayogī, Prāhāragamosasarīrakāyaprayogī. 3. Prāhāragasarīrakāyaprayogī, Āhāragamosasarīrakāyaprayogī. 4. Āhāragasarīrakāyaprayogī, Prāhāragamosasarīrakāyaprayogī. 1. Prāhāragasarīrakāyaprayogī, Prāhāragamosasarīrakāyaprayogī. 2. Prāhāragasarīrakāyaprayogī, Prāhāragamosasarīrakāyaprayogī. 3. Prāhāragasarīrakāyaprayogī, Āhāragamosasarīrakāyaprayogī. 4. Āhāragasarīrakāyaprayogī, Prāhāragamosasarīrakāyaprayogī. These are the eight categories of Jīvas." 1. Prajñāpanā Sūtra Malay. Vṛtti, Patrāṅka 320

## Sixteenth Experiment Word ] [215 [1077 Q.] Bhagavan! Are all beings true-mind-practitioners or are they all karma-body-practitioners? [1077 A.] Gautama! (1) All beings are true-mind-practitioners, as well as (false-mind-practitioners, true-false-mind-practitioners, false-false-mind-practitioners, etc., and also vikriya-mixed-body-practitioners and karma-body-practitioners, (thus thirteen categories) are present, (1) or one is a food-body-practitioner, (2) or many are food-body-practitioners, (3) or one is a food-mixed-body-practitioner, (4) or many beings are food-mixed-body-practitioners. These four are broken. If the first broken category of thirteen categories is counted with these, then there are five broken categories / (four broken categories of two combinations) 1. Or one food-body-practitioner and one food-mixed-body-practitioner, 2. Or one food-body-practitioner and many food-mixed-body-practitioners, 3. Or many food-body-practitioners and one food-mixed-body-practitioner, 4. Or many food-body-practitioners and many food-mixed-body-practitioners. These are eight broken categories in relation to the practice of beings. (Including the first broken category, there are nine broken categories.) Discussion - The presentation of the practice pattern in the aggregate beings through the division of the aggregate beings - In this sutra (1077), the broken categories of the text found in relation to the practice in the aggregate beings are described / In the aggregate beings, there is one broken category of thirteen categories - In the aggregate beings, excluding the food and food-mixed, there is one broken category of the remaining 13 categories / The meaning is that many beings are always found to be true-mind-practitioners, false-mind-practitioners, as well as vikriya-mixed-body-practitioners, and also karma-body-practitioners. Hell beings always start vikriya-mixed-body-practice after rebirth, therefore they are always vikriya-mixed-body-practitioners / Plant beings, etc., are always found in interval motion due to disintegration, therefore they are always karma-body-practitioners, but food-body-practitioners are perhaps not found at all; because their interval is possible up to six months at the most. ' That is, it is also possible that not even one food-body-practitioner is found for six months / When they are found, they are minimal, one, two or three, and at the most, thousands (two thousand to nine thousand). Thus, when there is not even one food-body-practitioner and food-mixed-body-practitioner, then there is one broken category of thirteen categories with a plural specific to many beings, because the beings of the said thirteen categories always exist in many forms / The order of the broken categories - First broken category - When one food-body-practitioner is found along with the aforementioned thirteen categories, then there is one broken category / Second broken category - Along with the aforementioned thirteen categories, many 1. Food-body-practitioners are not found for six months / According to the rule, at one time / / 1 / / / are found, at one time, one, two, three, five are found / According to the rule, the most of these are thousands / / 2 //

---------------------------
[216] When a being is found to be *āhārakamishrasharīrakāyaprayogi*, then the second *bhanga* occurs. The third and fourth *bhanga* - in the same way, with the aforementioned 13 categories, when a being is *āhārakamishrasharīrakāyaprayogi*, or many beings are *āhārakamishrasharīrakāyaprayogi*, then the third and fourth *bhanga* occur. Thus, these 4 *bhanga* occur in sequence / From the fifth to the eighth *bhanga* - four *bhanga* are *dviksamyogi*, which have been mentioned before. By combining the aforementioned *bhanga* with thirteen categories, these are all 9 *bhanga*.  [1078]  *Nāraka* and *bhavanapati* are classified by *prayogaprarūpaṇā* 1078.  "O *bhaṇte*! Are *nairaiyika* *satya-manaḥ-prayogi*, or are they *karmāṇasharīrakāyaprayogi*? [1078]  "O *Gautama*! *Nairaiyika* are all *satya-manaḥ-prayogi*, as well as *vaikrīyamishrasharīrakāyaprayogi*; 1- or one (*nairaiyika*) is *karmāṇasharīrakāyaprayogi*, 2- or many (*nairaiyika*) are *karmāṇasharīrakāyaprayogi* / [1078]  *Bhagavan*!

Similarly, *asurakumāra* should also be classified by *prayogaprarūpaṇā*, as well as *thaṇiyakumāra* / / 1079]  Similarly, *asurakumāra* should also be classified by *prayogaprarūpaṇā*, as well as *thaṇiyakumāra*.  Discussion - *Nāraka* and *bhavanapati* are classified by *prayogaprarūpaṇā* - In these two sūtras, the classification of *nāraka* and *bhavanapati* into three *bhanga* based on oneness and multiplicity is explained.  *Nāraka* always have ten categories, which are specific to multiplicity - from *satya-manaḥ-prayogi* to *vaikrīyamishrasharīrakāyaprayogi*, there are always ten categories specific to multiplicity, but *karmāṇasharīrakāyaprayogi* *nāraka* are sometimes not found at all; because the absence of the *upapāta* of the *narakagati* is said to be twelve *muhurta*. This is one *bhanga* /  Second-third *bhanga* - When *karmāṇasharīrakāyaprayogi* *nāraka* are found, then the inferior ones are one or two, and the superior ones are countless /  From this perspective, when one *karmāṇasharīrakāyaprayogi* is found, then the second *bhanga* occurs, and when many *karmāṇasharīrakāyaprayogi* are found, then the third *bhanga* occurs /  The statement regarding the *prayoga* of the ten types of *bhavanavāsī*, including *asurakumāra*, should be understood in the same way, with respect to oneness and multiplicity.  1. *Prajñāpanasūtra*. *Malay*. *Vṛtti*, page 323-324  2. *Bhagavatisūtra* Sh. 8 U. 1 states that *vaikrīyamishrasharīra-prayoga* is considered only in the case of gods and *nāraka* in an insufficient state.  3. *Prajñāpanasūtra* *Malay*. *Vṛtti*, page 324

## The 16th Experiment Word [217] [Concerning the Use of the Bodies of the One-Sensed, the Defective-Sensed, and the Transmigratory Five-Sensed]

1080. "Bhagavan! Are the Earth-bodied beings users of the Auspicious Body, the Auspicious-Mixed Body, or the Karmic Body?"

"Gautama! The Earth-bodied beings are users of the Auspicious Body, the Auspicious-Mixed Body, and the Karmic Body. Similarly, from the Fire-bodied beings up to the Plant-bodied beings (the statement concerning use should be said), the special point is that the Air-bodied beings are users of the Unmixed Body and the Unmixed-Mixed Body."

1081. "Bhagavan! Are the Two-Sensed beings users of the Auspicious Body, or up to the Karmic Body?"

"Gautama! All Two-Sensed beings are users of the False-Truth-Speech-Use, the Auspicious Body, the Auspicious-Mixed Body, or one (Two-Sensed being) is a user of the Karmic Body, or many (Two-Sensed beings) are users of the Karmic Body. Similarly, the Three-Sensed and the Four-Sensed (the statement concerning use) should be understood in the same way."

1082. "The Five-Sensed Transmigratory beings, like the Hell-beings (Su. 1078), are users of the Auspicious Body, the Auspicious-Mixed Body, or one (Five-Sensed Transmigratory being) is a user of the Karmic Body, or many (Five-Sensed Transmigratory beings) are users of the Karmic Body."

---------------------------
[218] {There is also the *Prajñāpanā Sūtra*. 1. Or there is one (five-sensed, transmigratory) *kārmāṇa-śarīra-kāya-prayogi*, 2. Or there are many (five-sensed, transmigratory beings) *kārmāṇa-śarīra-kāya-prayogi* / Discussion - The classification of *ekendriya*, *vikaleindriya*, and *tiryanch-panchendriya* with respect to *prayoga* - In the present three *sūtras* (from *sū*. 1080 to 1082), the classification of *prayoga* with respect to the oneness and multiplicity of beings from *ekendriya* to *tiryanch-panchendriya* has been done. The conclusion is that earth-bodied, water-bodied, fire-bodied, and plant-bodied beings are always found in large numbers as *audārika-śarīra-kāya-prayogi*, *audārika-miśra-śarīra-kāya-prayogi*, and *kārmāṇa-śarīra-kāya-prayogi*, therefore these three terms are in the plural, this is one *bhanga*; but in air-bodied beings, in addition to the aforementioned three *prayogas*, *kriyadvika* (i.e. *vaikriya-śarīra-kāya-prayoga* and *vaikriya-miśra-śarīra-kāya-prayoga*) are also found / That is - in air-bodied beings, these five terms are always found in multiplicity. The multiplicity of these five is one *bhanga*. All two-sensed, three-sensed, and four-sensed beings are *asatyāmṛṣāvacana-prayogi*, because they neither use true speech, nor false speech, nor speech of both kinds / They are also *audārika-śarīra-kāya-prayogi* and *audārika-miśra-śarīra-kāya-prayogi* / Although there is a period of absence of *upapāta* for a moment in the beings of two senses etc., the period of absence of *upapāta* is short and the period of *audārika-miśra* is very large in measure. Therefore, *audārika-miśra-śarīra-kāya-prayogi* are always found in them. Thus, there is one *bhanga* of these three. Sometimes, not even one *kārmāṇa-śarīra-kāya-prayogi* is found in them, because the absence of their *upapāta* is said to be a moment. When they are found, they are found in the least as one or two, and in the best as innumerable / Thus, when not even one *kārmāṇa-śarīra-kāya-prayogi* is found, then there is the first *bhanga* of the aforementioned three terms. When one *kārmāṇa-śarīra-kāya-prayogi* is found, then there is the second *bhanga* specific to oneness / When many two-sensed etc. beings are *kārmāṇa-śarīra-prayogi*, then there is the third *bhanga*. The statement regarding the *prayoga* of five-sensed transmigratory beings should be known as similar to that of hell beings, but the special feature in them is that they are also *audārika-śarīra-kāya-prayogi* and *audārika-miśra-śarīra-kāya-prayogi* after *vaikriya-śarīra-kāya-prayogi* and *vaikriya-miśra-śarīra-kāya-prayogi* like hell beings. Besides this, there are 4 types of *manaḥ-prayoga* and four types of *vacana-prayoga*, by adding these 8 terms to the aforementioned 4 terms, a total of 12 terms are obtained, which are always found in multiplicity in five-sensed transmigratory beings. Sometimes, not even one *kārmāṇa-śarīra-kāya-prayogi* is found in five-sensed transmigratory beings, because the period of absence of their *upapāta* is said to be a moment / When there is not even one *kārmāṇa-śarīra-kāya-prayogi*, then there is the first *bhanga* mentioned above. When there is one *kārmāṇa-śarīra-kāya-prayogi*, then there is the second *bhanga*, and when there are many *kārmāṇa-śarīra-kāya-prayogi*, then there is the third *bhanga*. 1. *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* *Malay.

[221] The beings who are food-body-activity-users, the beings who are food-mixed-body-activity-users, and the beings who are karmic-body-activity-users are of 6 types. The beings who are food-body-activity-users, the beings who are food-mixed-body-activity-users, and the beings who are karmic-body-activity-users are of 7 types. The beings who are food-body-activity-users, the beings who are food-mixed-body-activity-users, and the beings who are karmic-body-activity-users are of 8 types.

## The Sixteenth Experiment-Word [225]

There are one *Karmanshaaririkaaya-prayogi*, or sixteen *Audarika-mishra-shaaririkaaya-prayogi*, sixteen *Pahaaraka-shaaririkaaya-prayogi*, sixteen *Ahaaraka-mishra-shaaririkaaya-prayogi*, and sixteen *Karmanshaaririkaaya-prayogi*. In this way, there are sixteen *bhangas* from the four-fold combination. And all of these (eight *asanyogi*, twenty-four *dwikasanyogi*, thirty-two *trikasanyogi*, and sixteen *chatuhasanyogi*) together make eighty *bhangas*. // 80 //

**Explanation:** This sutra (1083) presents the form of the experiments found in humans through the division of humans into *asanyogi*, *dwikasanyogi*, *trikasanyogi*, and *chatuhasanyogi*, resulting in eighty *bhangas*.

In humans, the eleven *pada* (experiments) are always found in the plural form in the fifteen types of experiments found in all humans. For example, the four types of *vachanaprayogi*, *Audarika-shaaririkaaya-prayogi*, and *Vaikriya-dwikaprayogi* (which includes *Vaikriya-shaaririkaaya-prayogi* and *Vaikriya-mishra-shaaririkaaya-prayogi*). The *Vaikriya-mishra-shaaririkaaya-prayogi* in humans should be understood in relation to the *Vidyaadharas*, because *Vidyaadharas* and other beings with false vision and other *Vaikriya-landhi* qualities are always found to be *vikuruvana*. In humans, *Audarika-mishra-shaaririkaaya-prayogi* and *Karmanshaaririkaaya-prayogi* are sometimes not found at all, because they are found at the time of new birth, and the time of separation from the birth of humans is said to be twelve *muhurtas*. *Ahaaraka-shaaririkaaya-prayogi* and *Ahaaraka-mishra-shaaririkaaya-prayogi* are also sometimes found, as has been said before. Therefore, the absence of the four experiments, *Audarika-mishra* etc., makes this first *bhang* with eleven specific *pada* in the plural form.

The *ekasanyogi* *bhang* is two *bhangas* with the *Audarika-mishra-prayogi* in singular and plural forms. Similarly, there are two *bhangas* for *Pahaaraka-prayogi*, two *bhangas* for *Ahaaraka-mishra-prayogi*, and two *bhangas* for *Karmanshaaririkaaya-prayogi*. In this way, combining one by one, there are eight *bhangas*.

The *dwikasanyogi* are twenty-four *bhangas*. Taking the *Audarika-mishra* and *Pahaaraka* *pada*, there are four *bhangas* with singular and plural forms. Taking the *Audarika-mishra* and *Pahaaraka-mishra* *pada*, there are four *bhangas*. Taking the *Audarika-mishra* and *Karmanshaaririkaaya* *pada*, there are four *bhangas*. Taking the *Ahaaraka* and *Ahaaraka-mishra* *pada*, there are four *bhangas*. Taking the *Pahaaraka* and *Karmanshaaririkaaya* *pada*, there are four *bhangas*. And taking the *Pahaaraka-mishra* and *Karmanshaaririkaaya* *pada*, there are four *bhangas*. All of these together make twenty-four *dwikasanyogi* *bhangas*.

The *trikasanyogi* are thirty-two *bhangas*. Taking the *Audarika-mishra*, *Ahaaraka*, and *Ahaaraka-mishra* *pada*, there are eight *bhangas* with singular and plural forms. Taking the *Audarika-mishra*, *Ahaaraka*, and *Karmanshaaririkaaya* *pada*, there are eight *bhangas*. Taking the *Audarika-mishra*, *Ahaaraka-mishra*, and *Karmanshaaririkaaya* *pada*, there are eight *bhangas*. And taking the *Ahaaraka*, *Ahaaraka-mishra*, and *Karmanshaaririkaaya* *pada*, there are eight *bhangas*. All of these together make thirty-two *trikasanyogi* *bhangas*.

The *chatuhasanyogi* are sixteen *bhangas*. Taking the *Audarika-mishra*, *Ahaaraka*, *Pahaaraka-mishra*, and *Karmanshaaririkaaya* *pada*, there are sixteen *bhangas* with singular and plural forms. In this way, the *asanyogi*, *dwikasanyogi*, *trikasanyogi*, and *chatuhasanyogi* together make eighty *bhangas*.

[226] [The use of the Vaanavyantara, Jyotishka and Vaimanika Devas, as described in the Prajnapanasutra, should be understood as similar to the use of the Asurakumara (Su. 1079). / [1084] The use of the Vaanavyantara, Jyotishka and Vaimanika Devas (as mentioned in Su. 1079) should be understood as similar to the use of the Asurakumara. Discussion - The use of the Vaanavyantara, Jyotishka and Vaimanika Devas, as described in the present (Sutra 1084), is an exaggeration of the Asurakumara. Five types of motion 1085. How many types of motion are there, Bhagavan? [1085 U.] Gautama! (Motion) is said to be of five types. They are - (1) Prayogagati, (2) Tatagati, (3) Bandhancchedanagati, (4) Upapatagati and (5) Vihayogati / [1085 Pr.] Bhagavan! How many types of motion are there? [1085 U.] Gautama! (Motion) is said to be of five types. They are - (1) Prayogagati, (2) Tatagati, (3) Bandhancchedanagati, (4) Upapatagati and (5) Vihayogati / Discussion - Five types of motion - The present Sutra describes five types of motion, namely Prayogagati, etc. Explanation of motion - To move, to move or to attain is motion. That attainment is of two types - related to change of place and related to change of state / The word motion is used in both. / For example, 'Where has Devadatta gone? He has gone to the port' and 'As soon as he said it, he became angry.' Just as there are two types of worldly use, there are also two types of transcendental use. For example, 'An atom goes from one world to another in one moment' and 'It attains those states.' Therefore, here the meaning of motion is - to attain from one place to another, or to attain another state by abandoning one state / The fall of motion is called motion. Prayogagati - Fifteen types of special business-like use have already been mentioned in this very verse. Motion in the form of use is Prayogagati / This is in the form of attaining a different place, because the pudgala of Satyamana, etc., which is motivated by the jiva, travels a short or long distance. Tatagati - Extensive motion is called Tatagati. For example, Jinadatta has set out for a village, but has not yet reached that village, he is on the way and is moving forward step by step. This type of motion in the form of attaining a different place is Tatagati. Although moving forward is the use of Jinadatta's body, this motion can also be considered under Prayogagati, but because of its special feature of extensiveness, it has been mentioned separately from Prayogagati. The same should be understood in the future. 1. Prajnapanasutra, Malay. Vritti, Page No. 327-328

## Sixteenth Experiment Word] [227 Bandhanchhedanati-The breaking of bondage is Bandhanchhedan and the motion that results from it is Bandhanchhedanagati. This motion is of the liberated (released) body of the being, or of the being that has been ejected (thrown out) from the body. The upward motion of the castor seed from the bursting of the pod is a type of Vihayogati, not Bandhanchhedanagati, according to the commentator. Upapatgati-Upapat means emergence / It is of three types-Kshetropapat, Bhavopapat and Nobhavopapat / Kshetra means-sky, where Narakadi beings, Siddhas and Pudgalas reside. Bhava means-the Narakadi Paryaya of the being that arises from the contact of karma / The being that is subject to karma is called Mava. Apart from Bhava, the Narakatva etc. Paryayas that are not generated by karma, the Pudgalas or Siddhas that are devoid of them are Nobhava. Both of the above (Pudgalas and Siddhas) are devoid of the characteristics of the aforementioned Bhava. This type of Upapat-like motion is called Upapatgati. Vihayogati-Vihayas means motion in the sky is Vihayogati / Differentiation of the types of motion and their nature is described from 1086. 

[1086 Pr.] (O Bhagavan!) What is that Prayogagati? [1086 U.] Gautama! Prayogagati is said to be of fifteen types. It is as follows-Satyamanahprayogagati (to) Yavat Karmanasharirakayaprayogagati / Just as the Prayog (fifteen types) has been said, so also this (motion) should be said (to be of fifteen types). 

[1087 Pr.] O Bhagavan! How many types of Prayogagati are said to be of beings? [1087 U.] Gautama! (It) is said to be of fifteen types / It is as follows-Satyamanahprayogagati to Yavat Karmanasharira prayogagati / 

[1088 Pr.] O Bhagavan! How many types of Prayogagati are said to be of Nairyikas? [1088 U.] Gautama! The Prayogagati of Nairyikas is said to be of eleven types. It is as follows-Satyamanahprayogagati etc. / Using this (from Asurakumaras to) Vaimanikas, for whatever type of motion there is, that many types of motion should be said.

## Translation:

**[240]** The *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* does not explain in the fourth *uddesaka* how a *leśyā* transforms into another *leśyā*. The six *leśyā*s are described separately in terms of their color, smell, taste, and touch. Subsequently, the number of results, regions, entry into regions, classifications, and locations of the *leśyā*s starting with *kṛṣṇa* are described. Finally, a detailed description of the locations of the *leśyā*s starting with *kṛṣṇa* is given from the perspective of inferior, superior, and medium, in terms of substance, region, and the combination of substance and region, as well as in terms of their relative abundance. At the beginning of the fifth *uddesaka*, the authority of the results from the fourth *uddesaka* is reiterated. After that, it is stated that a particular *leśyā* does not transform into another *leśyā* or into its color, etc. The commentator, in resolving this apparent contradiction, states that the transformation of one *leśyā* into another, as described in the fourth *uddesaka*, should be understood in relation to *tiryancas* and humans, while the prohibition of one *leśyā* transforming into another, as described in the fifth *uddesaka*, should be understood in relation to gods and hell beings. The sixth *uddesaka* discusses the *leśyā*s of humans and women living in various regions, including *Bharata* and others. Subsequently, it is stated that there is no rule that the *leśyā* of the offspring should be the same as that of the father and mother. The *leśyā*s of the father and offspring or the mother and offspring can be either the same or different.

This extensive discussion of *leśyā*s, divided into six *uddesaka*s, does not include the detailed discussion of the *adhyavasaya*s of beings with different *leśyā*s, their characteristics, positions, movements, and culminations, as found in the *Uttarādhyayana* and other *āgama* texts. Nor does it include the description of the two aspects of *leśyā* - substance and feeling - as found in the *Bhagawatisūtra* and other texts. There is also some repetition in the descriptions.

[242] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra] It cannot be said that [Leśyā] is a substance, because even in the case of an Ayogika Kevali, there is an absence of Leśyā despite the presence of Aghati Karmas. Therefore, it is appropriate to consider Leśyā as a substance belonging to Yoga, based on the Pariśeṣya Nyāya. These substances belonging to Yoga, as long as the Kṣayās exist, are the ones that incite their rise, because the ability to incite the rise of Kṣayās is seen in the substances belonging to Yoga. Leśyā is not the cause of the state of Karmas, but Kṣayās are the cause of the state of Leśyā. The Leśyās that are included in the rise of Kṣayās are the cause of Anu-bhāga-bandha. [1124] [Pra.] Bhagavan! Are all Narakas (hell beings) of the same type of food, the same body, and the same breath? [1124 Ut.] Gautama! This meaning is not valid. [Pra.] Bhagavan!

[Ut.] Among them, those who are Mahāśarīra Narakas, they consume a lot of Pudgalas, they transform a lot of Pudgalas, they breathe in a lot of Pudgalas, and they breathe out a lot of Pudgalas. They eat frequently, they transform (Pudgalas) frequently, they breathe in frequently, and they breathe out frequently. Among them, those who are Alpāśarīra, they consume fewer Pudgalas, they transform fewer Pudgalas, they breathe in fewer Pudgalas, and they breathe out fewer Pudgalas. They eat occasionally, they transform occasionally, they breathe in occasionally, and they breathe out occasionally. Therefore, Gautama! This is how it is said: All Narakas are not of the same type of food, they are not all of the same body, and they are not all of the same breath. [1124 Pra.]

Many Narakas have the same lifespan and are born together, 2. Many have the same lifespan but are born at different times, 3. Many have different lifespans but are born together, and 4. Many have different lifespans and are born at different times. / For this reason, O Gautama! All Narakas are neither of the same lifespan nor born together. / - Seventh Door // 7 //

## Discussion

**Presentation of the Seven Doors related to Samahar etc. in Naireyikas** - The seven sutras presented here discuss the similarities and differences related to the seven doors mentioned earlier, namely Aahar etc., in Naireyikas.

**Maha-sharira - Alpa-sharira** - Those Narakas whose bodies are relatively large are called Maha-sharira, and those whose bodies are relatively small are called Alpa-sharira. The body of a Naireyika is as small as an infinitesimal part of a finger, and as large as five hundred Dhanush. This measurement is in comparison to the Bhavadharani body. In comparison to the Uttarvaikriya body, the smallest is an infinitesimal part of a finger, and the largest is one thousand Dhanush.

**Doubt Resolution** - Why is the difference in Aahar etc. not mentioned first, but the difference in bodies is mentioned first? The reason is that once the difference in bodies is mentioned, the difference in Aahar, Ucchvas etc. is easily understood. / With this intention, the question related to the body, which is to be discussed later, is resolved first.

Page #834:
---------------------------
## 246] Why is there a difference between the Narakas with Maha-sharira (great body) and others?

Those Narakas who have Maha-sharira consume a lot of Pudgalas (matter) compared to those with smaller bodies, because their bodies are larger. It is common knowledge in the world that elephants, which have large bodies, consume more food than rabbits, which have smaller bodies. However, this statement should be understood in terms of the majority, because some humans, despite having large bodies, are light eaters, and some, despite having small bodies, are heavy eaters. Here, too, smallness and greatness should be understood relatively.

Naraka beings, due to the arising of Asata-vedaniya (unpleasant) experience, contrary to the experience of Sata-vedaniya (pleasant), are, as it were, those with Maha-sharira, experiencing extreme suffering and intense desire for food, and thus they consume a lot of Pudgalas and transform a lot of Pudgalas. Transformation happens according to the Pudgalas consumed as food. Here, even though there is no question about the result, it has been explained because it is the function of food.

Similarly, due to having Maha-sharira, they inhale and exhale a lot of Pudgalas. Those who have large bodies (giant) inhale and exhale much more than those of their kind with smaller bodies, and they also suffer more. Therefore, such Narakas are said to suffer more.

Due to the difference in time related to food, etc., those with Maha-sharira are seen to consume food more frequently and repeatedly than those with smaller bodies. When they eat frequently, they also transform frequently, and they inhale and exhale frequently. The point is that Maha-kaya Narakas, due to having Maha-sharira and experiencing extreme suffering, continuously perform the actions of inhalation, etc.

Those Narakas who have relatively smaller bodies consume fewer Pudgalas than Maha-kaya Narakas, transform fewer Pudgalas, and inhale and exhale fewer Pudgalas. They may eat, but not always. The implication is that the interval between meals for Maha-kaya Narakas is less than that for the smaller Narakas. Because they eat less frequently, they may transform less frequently, not always. Similarly, they may inhale and exhale, but not always. Because smaller Narakas experience less suffering than Maha-kaya Narakas, they do not continuously perform the actions of inhalation and exhalation, but do so with intervals.

Or, due to having a smaller body, they do not eat as much as they would like to in a given time, and due to not having enough time for inhalation and exhalation, they do not inhale. In other times (sufficient time), they eat and inhale.

**Difference in Karma, Varna (caste), and Leshya (temperament) between Narakas born earlier and later:**

Those Narakas who have already been born have less Karma, because more time has passed since their birth. They have already experienced a lot of Naraka-ayu (life in hell), Naraka-gati (path to hell), and Asata-vedaniya, etc.

## Seventeenth Leshya Chapter / First Objective

**[247 Nirjara have been completed, their karmas are only slightly remaining / Therefore, they are called Naraka with pre-born minor karmas. But those who are born later in Naraka are those with major karmas, because their Naraka lifespan, Naraka path, and Asatavedaniya karmas, etc., have been slightly destroyed, many karmas are still remaining / Therefore, they are relatively major karmas. This statement should be understood in relation to Narakas of similar situations, otherwise, in Ratnaprabhaprithvi, a Naraka with a long lifespan may have had a large part of his lifespan destroyed, only a single Palyopama remains, on the other hand, at that time, a Naraka with a low lifespan of ten thousand years may have been born later, even then, compared to this later-born Naraka, the said pre-born Naraka is also a major karma holder.]**

**[Similarly, those who have lived for a relatively longer time after birth are of a purer color / In Narakas, the intense section of the Aprashasta (inauspicious) Varna-namakarma arises, but a large part of that inauspicious section of the pre-born Narakas is destroyed, a small part remains. Varna-namakarma is a Pudgalavipaki nature. Therefore, the pre-born Naraka is of a purer color, while the later-born Naraka is of a less pure color, because the majority of the inauspicious intense section of their inauspicious Namakarma caused by Bhava is not destroyed, only a small part is destroyed. Therefore, the later-born Naraka is of a less pure color / This statement should also be understood in relation to Narakas of similar situations. Similarly, the pre-born Naraka destroys a large part of the Aprashasta Leshyadravyas, therefore, they are of a purer Leshya, while the later-born Naraka is able to destroy only a very small part of the Aprashasta Leshyadravyas, many of their Aprashasta Leshyadravyas remain.]**

**[Difference in the pain of Sanjibhat and Asanjibhat Narakas - Those who were previously (in the past) Sanji-panchendriya and then born in Naraka are called Sanjibhut Naraka, and those who are opposite to them are called Asanjibhut / Those Narakas who are Sanjibhut are relatively major pain holders, because those who were (in the past) Sanji, due to intense inauspicious Adhyavasaya, have bound intense inauspicious karmas and they are born in Maha-narakas. Conversely, those Narakas who are Asanjibhut are of lesser pain / Asanji Jivas can bind to any of the Naraka, Tiryanch, Manushya, and Devagati paths / Therefore, they are born in Naraka by binding to Naraka lifespan, but due to the lack of very intense Adhyavasaya, they are born only in those Naraka-avasas within Ratnaprabhaprithvi where there is no very intense pain. Or, the meaning of Sanji here is Samyagdristi / Sanjibhut means that the Samyagdristi Naraka experiences more pain due to mental sorrow and remorse for the past inauspicious karmas. The Asanjibhut (Mithyadristi) Naraka does not experience such remorse, therefore, he is of lesser pain.]**

[249 1133. [1] Thus, regarding the Leshya, ask. There, those who are of the good color are of the impure color. There, those who are of the bad color are of the pure color. Therefore, this is the way it is! Thus, the Asura Kumaras are not of the same color.  /  [1133-1 Pr.]  O Bhagavan! Are all Asura Kumaras of the same color and the same Leshya? 1133-1 U.]  Gautama! (As previously stated) among the two types of Asura Kumaras, those who are born earlier are of the more impure color, and those who are born later are of the purer color. Therefore, O Gautama! It is said that all Asura Kumaras are not of the same color. [2] Thus, regarding the Leshya. [1133-2] In the same way, regarding the Leshya (it should be said / ) 1134. Regarding the pain, like the Narayikas (Su. 1128)  /  [1134] (Regarding the Asura Kumaras) regarding the pain, (as stated in Su. 1128) like the Narayikas (regarding the description of their pain). 1135. The rest, like the Nairyikas (Su. 1129-30)  /  [1135] Regarding the actions and lifespan of the Asura Kumaras, the rest of the description (mentioned in Su. 1129-1130) should be understood as being like the Nairyikas (regarding the description of their actions and lifespan). 1136. Thus, up to the Thanik Kumaras. [1136] In the same way (like the description of the food etc. of the Asura Kumaras, from the Naga Kumaras) up to the Stanit Kumaras (the description should be understood).

The discussion regarding the Asura Kumaras etc. and the Bhavanapatis has been presented in six Sutras (Su. 1131 to 1136) regarding the food etc. of the Asura Kumaras etc. and the ten types of Bhavanapati Devas through the seven doors. The Asura Kumaras etc. have a large body and a small body. The largest body of the Asura Kumaras is seven hands long. This is the measure in comparison to the Bhavadharani body. Their small body should be understood as being an immeasurable fraction of an angula. In comparison to the Uttarvaikriya, their large body is one lakh yojanas long, and their small body is an immeasurable fraction of an angula. Thus, the Asura Kumaras who have a larger body in comparison to the Bhavadharani body, consume more pudgalas as food, and those who have a smaller body, consume fewer pudgalas as food. / Regarding the karma of the Asura Kumaras etc. who are born earlier and later, it is the opposite of the Narakas. It was said regarding the Narakas that the Narakas who are born earlier have less karma, and the Narakas who are born later have more karma. But the Asura Kumaras who are born earlier have more karma, and those who are born later have less karma.

---------------------------
It is said that there are 250 *Prajñāpanā Sūtras*. The reason for this is that Asura-kumāras, upon abandoning their existence, are either born in the *tiryañc-yoni* or in the *manuṣya-yoni*. Those born in the *tiryañc-yoni* are born as one-sensed beings in the *pṛthvī-kāya*, *ap-kāya*, or *vanaspati-kāya*, and many are also born as five-sensed *tiryañc*. Those born as humans are born as *karma-bhūmi-ja* humans, not as *akarma-bhūmi-ja* or *samūcchima* humans. When they have six months of life remaining, they bind the *āyu* related to their previous existence. At the time of binding the *āyu*, they increase the *prakṛti* that is suitable for either the *tiryañc* or the human. Therefore, the Asura-kumāras born earlier have *mahā-karma*, but those born later have not yet bound the *āyu* related to their previous existence, nor have they increased the *prakṛti* suitable for the *tiryañc* or the human. Therefore, they have lesser *karma*. This *sūtra* should also be understood in relation to the finite number of Asura-kumāras who are in the same situation and have the same existence. The Asura-kumāras born earlier have impure *varṇa-leśyā*, while the Asura-kumāras born later have the opposite, and they experience the auspicious, intense section of the *varṇa-nāma-karma* related to their existence. The auspicious section of the Asura-kumāras born earlier is very weak and deficient, which is why they have a more impure *varṇa*. But the Asura-kumāras born later have a large portion of the auspicious section of their *varṇa-nāma-karma* that is not weak and is present, which is why they have a purer *varṇa*. The same should be understood regarding *leśyā*. The reasoning in this matter is that the Asura-kumāras born earlier have, from the time of their birth, experienced *leśyā-dravya* with intense experiences and have depleted a large portion of it. Now, only a small amount of *leśyā-dravya* with mild experiences remains. Therefore, the Asura-kumāras born earlier have impure *leśyā*, and those born later, being the opposite, have purer *leśyā*. From the *pṛthvī-kāya* to the five-sensed *tiryañc*, there are seven forms of *samāhāra* etc. 1137. Just as it has been said (in *Sūtra* 1124-27) regarding the *nairāyika* (regarding *āhāra* etc.), so it should be said regarding the *pṛthvī-kāya* (regarding *sama-viṣama* *āhāra*, *karma*, *varṇa*, and *leśyā*). 1138. "O *bhaṇte*, do all *pṛthvī-kāya* have the same *vedanā*?" "Yes, *goyamā*, they all have the same *vedanā*." "By what means, *bhaṇte*, is this said?" "Yes, *goyamā*, the *pṛthvī-kāya* all experience the same *vedanā* because they all experience the same *praśaṇṇī-praśaṇṇī-mūya-praṇiya-vevaṇa*." 1. *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* *Malayavṛtti*, folio 336 2.

**252]**  A special feature of the actions of the hell-beings is this: There are three types of five-sensed beings (**tiryanch**), namely: **Samyagdristi**, **Mithyadristi**, and **Samyamihyadristi**.  

Of these, those who are **Samyagdristi** are of two types: **Asanyata** and **Sanyatasanyata**.  

Those who are **Sanyatasanyata** have three actions: **Prarambhiki**, **Parigrahiki**, and **Mayapratyaya**.  

Those who are **Asanyata** have four actions: 1. **Prarambhiki**, 2. **Parigrahiki**, 3. **Mayapratyaya**, and 4. **Apratyaakhyanakriya**.  

Of the three mentioned above, those who are **Mithyadristi** and those who are **Samyamihyadristi** definitely have five actions: 1. **Prarambhiki**, 2. **Parigrahiki**, 3. **Mayapratyaya**, 4. **Apratyaakhyanakriya**, and 5. **Mithyadarshanapratyaya**.  

The rest of the descriptions should be done in the same way (as before).  

**Discussion:**  

From earth-bodied beings to five-sensed beings (**tiryanch**), the seven gates (**samahar** etc.) have been described in the five sutras (from sutra 1137 to 1141).  

From earth-bodied beings to five-sensed beings (**tiryanch**), the seven gates (**samahar** etc.) have been described in the five sutras (from sutra 1137 to 1141).  

The earth-bodied beings have a small body (**alpasarira**) and a large body (**mahasarira**). Although the body of all earth-bodied beings is only as large as an infinitesimal part of a finger, the Agamas state that "one earth-bodied being is four-fold fallen compared to another earth-bodied being in terms of their ability to understand each other," etc.  

Accordingly, they are proven to be relatively large-bodied and small-bodied.  

Those who are large-bodied (**mahasarira**) consume a lot of **pudgala** due to their large body, they breathe heavily, and they eat and breathe frequently.  

Those who are small-bodied (**alpasarira**) consume less food and breathe less due to their small body. They may eat and breathe, but this should be understood in relation to the state of sufficiency and insufficiency.  

Why do earth-bodied beings etc. have sensations?  

All earth-bodied beings are **asangyi** (unconscious), meaning they are **mithyadristi** (false-sighted) or **amanaska** (mindless).  

They experience unconscious and uncontrolled sensations.  

This means that even though they experience sensations like those of a drunk or unconscious person, they do not understand that this is the result of their past evil karma, because they are **asangyi** and **mithyadristi**.  

The meaning of **maya**:  

Here, **maya** does not only mean **mayakshaya** (the subtle attachment), but it also means the four **kshayas** (attachments) that are bound to infinity, by implication.  

Therefore, the meaning of **maya** here is **mithyadristi** (false-sighted), because it means having the **kshayas** that are bound to infinity.  

**1142.**  "Master, do the earth-bodied beings have **samahar** (intake)?"  

"Yes, they do."  

"How?"  

"They have it through the mind, which is of two types: **mahasarira** (large-bodied) and **appasarira** (small-bodied)."  

"Then, those who are..."

[253] Those with great bodies consume many pudgalas, as long as they exhale many pudgalas, and perhaps consume, as long as they perhaps exhale. Those with small bodies consume fewer pudgalas, as long as they exhale fewer pudgalas; they consume repeatedly, as long as they exhale repeatedly. Therefore, O Gautama! it is said that all humans do not have the same consumption. 

The rest, as explained in the Neryikas (Su. 1125-30), should be understood according to the description of the six doors (karma, etc.) of the Naryikas. 

However, there is a distinction (from the Naryikas) in terms of actions. Humans are said to be of three types: Samyagdristi, Mithyadristi, and Samyamithyadristi. 

Of these, those who are Samyagdristi are said to be of three types: Sanjaya, Asanjaya, and Sanjayasanjaya. 

Those who are Sanjaya are of two types: Saragasanjaya and Vitragasanjaya. 

Of these, those who are Vitragasanjaya are inactive (without action). 

Those who are Saragasanjaya are of two types: Pramattasanjaya and Apramattasanjaya. 

Of these, those who are Apramattasanjaya have only one Maya-pratyaya action. Those who are Pramattasanjaya have two actions: Aarambhika and Maya-pratyaya. 

Those who are Sanjayasanjaya have three actions: 1. Aarambhika, 2. Pariggahiya, 3. Maya-pratyaya. 

Those who are Asanjaya have four actions: 1. Aarambhika, 2. Pariggahiya, 3. Maya-pratyaya, 4. Prapa-chakkhana-kriya. 

Those who are Mithyadristi and Samyamithyadristi have five actions: 1. Aarambhika, 2. Pariggahiya, 3. Maya-pratyaya, 4. Apa-chakkhara-kriya, 5. Mithyadarsanavattiya. 

The rest, as explained in the Neryikas. 

[1142 Pr.] Bhagavan! Are all humans the same in terms of consumption? 

[1142 U.] Gautama! This meaning is not valid. 

[Pr.] Bhagavan! Why is it said that all humans do not have the same consumption? 

[U.] Gautama! Humans are said to be of two types: 

Those with great bodies and those with small bodies. 

Of those with great bodies, they consume many pudgalas, as long as they exhale many pudgalas, and perhaps consume, as long as they perhaps exhale. 

Of those with small bodies, they consume fewer pudgalas, as long as they exhale fewer pudgalas; they consume repeatedly, as long as they exhale repeatedly. 

Therefore, O Gautama! it is said that all humans do not have the same consumption.

**Knowledge-Declaration Sutra (Prajñāpanāsūtra) and the Three Maya-Pratyayas**

* Among those who are unrestrained (asanyata), four actions are found: 1. Prārabhikī, 2. Pārigṛhikī, 3. Māyā-Pratyayā, and 4. Apratyākhyāna-kriyā. 
* However, those who are of false-view (mithyādṛṣṭi) or partially-false-view (samyamithyādṛṣṭi) definitely have all five actions: 1. Prārabhikī, 2. Pārigṛhikī, 3. Māyā-Pratyayā, 4. Apratyākhyāna-kriyā, and 5. Mithyādarsana-Pratyayā. 
* The remaining (of lifespan) should be understood in the same way as it has been described for the hell-beings.

**Discussion**

* **Human Beings and the Seven Doors:** The seven doors of intake, etc., in humans are described in the present Sutra (1142).
* **The Great Body (Mahāśarīra) of Humans:** Generally, humans with a great body consume a lot of matter (pudgala) as food and exhale it as breath. However, humans with a composite great body, like the Devas and Kurus, rarely consume food. Their food comes from the eighth meal (aṣṭama-bhakta), meaning they eat every three days. They also breathe infrequently because they are extremely happy compared to other humans.
* **The Small Body (Alpaśarīra) of Humans:** Humans with a small body eat frequently because they are small. Children, who have a small body, are seen to eat frequently in small amounts. Continuous eating is possible for those with a small body who are in a state of deep sleep (sammūcchima). Humans with a small body also breathe frequently because they experience a lot of suffering.
* **Humans Born Before (Pūrvotpanna):** Humans who are born before have pure complexion, etc., due to their youth.
* **The Nature of Restrained with Attachment (Sarāga-samyata) and Restrained without Attachment (Vītarāga-samyata):** Those whose passions (kaṣāya) have not been subdued or destroyed but who are restrained are called restrained with attachment. However, those whose passions have been completely subdued or destroyed are called restrained without attachment.
* **Restrained without Attachment:** Due to their lack of attachment, restrained without attachment do not perform any actions like Prārabhikī, etc.
* **Restrained with Attachment:** Those who are restrained without negligence (apramatta) perform only the Māyā-Pratyayā action, and even then, only the Sanjvalana-Māyā-Pratyayā action. This is because they are sometimes motivated to remove the slander of the Dharma-Sangha (religious community) and protect the teachings. Their passions are not completely destroyed.
* **Restrained with Negligence:** Those who are restrained with negligence (pramatta) are motivated by negligence (pramāda) to perform the Prārabhikī action. Therefore, the Prārabhikī action is possible for them. Since their passions are not completely destroyed, the Māyā-Pratyayā action should also be understood to be present in them.
* **The rest of the description is clear.**

**The Intake, etc., of the Inhabitants of the Inter-Worlds (Vāṇavyantara), the Luminaries (Jyotiṣka), and the Aerial Beings (Vaimānika)**

* **Sutra 1143:** The inhabitants of the inter-worlds, like the Asura-Kumāras (Sutra 1131-35), eat the eighth meal (aṣṭama-bhakta).
* **1. "Aṭṭhama-bhakta-ssa āhāro" (The food is the eighth meal).**
* **2. Prajñāpanāsūtra, Malay. Vṛtti, Folio 340-341.**

##  [256] [In the *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* and the *Jha Mohimao Gamo* (Sūtra 1124-44), it is said that the *Sāleśya* (those with *leśyā*) are all like *Nārakas* (hell beings) in terms of food, body, and breath.  [1145 Pr.] "O Bhagavan! Are all *Sāleśya* (those with *leśyā*) like *Nārakas* in terms of food, body, and breath?" (The same question applies to the subsequent gates.)  [1145 U.] (Gautama!) Just as the *Gama* (Sūtra 1124-1144) has described the general (collective *Nārakas* - physical) *Gama*, in the same way, the entire *Gama* of all *Sāleśya* (regarding the seven gates of *Nārakas*) should be described up to the *Vaimānikas* (celestial beings).  /  **Discussion:** The *Sāleśya* are the twenty-four *Vaṇḍa-favartī* (those who have attained the twenty-four *Vaṇḍas*) beings. This Sūtra (1145) describes the seven gates, including food, etc., from *Nārakas* with *leśyā* to *Vaimānikas*.  /  The description of the seven gates, including food, etc., in the twenty-four *Daṇḍakas* with *leśyā* like *Kṛṣṇa* etc., is as follows:  [1146 Pr.] "O Bhagavan! Are all *Kṛṣṇaleśyā* (those with *Kṛṣṇa leśyā*) *Nārakas* alike in terms of food, body, and breath?"  /  _ [1146 U.] Gautama! Just as the (Sūtra 1124-1130) has described the general (physical) *Nārakas* (regarding food, etc.), in the same way, the *Kṛṣṇaleśyā* *Nārakas* should also be understood.  / ) The difference is that, in terms of pain, *Nārakas* are of two types: *Māyī-mithyā-dṛṣṭi-upapannakas* (those who have attained the wrong view due to illusion) and *Amāyī-samyag-dṛṣṭi-upapannakas* (those who have attained the right view due to non-illusion).

**1146. Evam Jaha Kiṇhalesa Vicariya Taha ṇīlalesta Vicariyabbva / 1149]** Just as the Krishna Leshya ones (twenty-four Dandakavarti Jivas) have been considered, so too should the Neel Leshya ones be considered. 

**1150.

Their statements regarding the seven doors, etc., should also be understood in the same way. The special feature is that the statement regarding the pain of the Kapoot Leshya Nairyikas should be understood as being the same as the collective (technical Narakas) (as stated in Su. 1128).

**1151. Teuleśśāṇṁ Bhanta! Asurkumaraaṇṁ Tano Ceva Pucchayo. Goyama! Jahev Prohiya Tahev (Su. 1131-35) / ṇavarṁ Vedanaae Jaha Jotisiya (Su. 1144) / 1151 Pr.]** Bhagavan! The questions regarding food, etc., and the seven doors, etc., are the same for the Tejo Leshya Asura Kumaras. What is the solution? **[1151 U.]** Gautama! Just as the statement regarding food, etc., of the collective Asura Kumaras (without any specific Leshya, etc., qualifications) has been made (from Su. 1131 to 1135), so too should the statement regarding food, etc., of the Tejo Leshya Asura Kumaras be understood. The special feature is that the statement regarding pain should be made here just as it has been said for the Jyotishkas (in Su. 1144).

The special feature is that, in relation to actions, those who are restrained and those who are unrestrained should be stated, and there is no Sarama or Viyaraaga.

---------------------------
[258] Regarding humans with Tejo-leshya, it should be said that those who are restrained are of two types: distracted (pramat) and undistracted (apramat). However, the distinctions of Sarag-samyat (restrained with attachment) and Vitrag-samyat (restrained without attachment) do not exist among humans with Tejo-leshya. [1153] The statement regarding Vanavyantaras (intermediate beings) in relation to Tejo-leshya (as mentioned in Sutra 1151) should be understood as similar to Asurakumara (demon princes). [1154] Similarly, the same should be said about Jyotishka (astronomers) and Vaimanika (aeronautical beings) with Tejo-leshya. The remaining aspects like Ahar (food), etc., should be understood as similar to the Asurakumara mentioned earlier. [1155] The same should be said about those with Padma-leshya (lotus-colored aura) regarding Ahar (food), etc. It is important to note that this statement should be made only for those beings who possess Padma-leshya. The statement regarding Ahar (food), etc., for those with Shukla-leshya (white aura) is also the same, but it should be made only for those beings who possess it. And just as the (general) statement about Audika (medicinal) beings has been made, the same should be said about all (beings with Padma-leshya and Shukla-leshya) regarding Ahar (food), etc. It is important to note that Padma-leshya and Shukla-leshya are found only in Panchendriya-tiryanch (five-sensed animals), humans, and Vaimanika (aeronautical beings), not in other beings.

**[259]** Those who acquire the most excellent inauspicious state / The Mayi Mithyadrishti Narakas experience great pain in that most excellent inauspicious state, while the other Amayi Samyagdristi Narakas experience relatively less pain. In addition, regarding the remaining matters like food, etc., the statement about the Krishna Leshya-specific Narakas should be considered the same as that of the collective Narakas / The characterization of the actions of Krishna Leshya-specific humans - this has some special features from the collective. In fact, Krishna Leshya-specific humans are of three types based on the distinction of Samyagdristi, etc. Among these, there are three types of Samyagdristi humans - restrained, unrestrained, and restrained-unrestrained / Just as the actions of these three have been stated in the case of ordinary humans, so should it be said in the case of Krishna Leshya-specific humans. For example, there is no action in the Vitaraga-restrained humans. There are two actions in the Saraga-restrained humans - initial and Maya-perception. In the Krishna Leshya-distracted-restrained, it occurs. It does not occur in the non-distracted-restrained. All types of initial distraction occur, therefore, the initial action occurs in the distracted-restrained, and due to the absence of weakened passions, the Maya-perception action also occurs in them. But those who are restrained-unrestrained, they have three actions - initial, acquisitive, and Maya-perception, and in the unrestrained human, the fourth action of non-rejection is also found after these three.

The pain-formula of the Kapota Leshya Narakas - the statement about the pain of the Kapota Leshya-specific Narakas should be understood as the same as the collective Narakas. For example, the Kapota Leshya-specific Narakas have been said to be of two types - conscious and unconscious, etc., should be understood in this way. The unconscious being is also born in the first hell-earth, where the Kapota Leshya is present / 2 The statement of the Tejo Leshya-specific Prasur Kumar, etc. - according to the principle, Tejo Leshya does not occur in the Naraka, Tejas-bodied, Vayu-bodied, and disabled beings, therefore, the statement of the Asura Kumaras has been made first in relation to the Tejo Leshya / The statement about the Tejo Leshya-specific Asura Kumaras, except for pain, regarding the remaining six matters like food, etc., should be understood as the same as the collective Asura Kumaras / Regarding their pain-formula, it should be understood as the same as the pain-formula of the Jyotishka Devas / That is, in relation to this, instead of saying two distinctions of the Asura Kumaras - conscious and unconscious, two distinctions should be said - Mayi-Mithyadrishti-born and Amayi-Mithyadrishti-born, because the birth of unconscious beings in those with Tejo Leshya is impossible.

The action-formula of Tejo Leshya-specific humans - in relation to actions, restrained humans should be said to be of two types - distracted-restrained and non-distracted-restrained / Tejo Leshya is possible in both of these. The distinctions of Saraga-restrained and Vitaraga-restrained should not be made in Tejo Leshya-specific humans, because Tejo Leshya is not possible in the Vitaraga-restrained / It is found only in the Saraga-restrained. 1.

260] | **Prajñāpanasūtra** - The statement regarding **Tejo-leśyā**-associated **vāṇavyantara**s should be understood as similar to the statement of the Asura-kumāras. In such a situation, instead of classifying **Tejo-leśyā**-specific **vāṇavyantara**s as **saṁjñībhūta** and **asaṁjñībhūta**, they should be classified as **māyi-mithyādṛṣṭi-upapannak** and **amāyi-samyagdṛṣṭi-upapannak**, because **asaṁjñījīva**s are not produced in **Tejo-leśyā**-associated **vāṇavyantara**s.

## The Seventeenth Leshya Chapter: The Second Objective

This chapter discusses the number of Leshyas found in various beings, from the Vaimanika Devis to all worldly beings. The relevant collection of verses are as follows:

**1.**  Bhavanavasi and Vyantara Devas have Krishna, Neel, Kapoth and Tejo Leshyas.

**2.**  Jyotishkas, Saudharma and Ishana Devas have only Tejo Leshya.

**3.**  Sanatkumar, Mahendra and Brahmaloka have Padma Leshya, and those in later Kalpas have Shukla Leshya.

**4.**  Badar, Prithvikaaya, Apkaaya and every Vanaspatikaaya have the initial four Leshyas. Garbhaja Tiryanchas and humans have six Leshyas, and the remaining beings have the first three Leshyas.

**1170.**  **Question:**  O Bhagavan! Among the Seleshya, Krishna Leshya, and those with Shukla Leshya, and the Aleshya beings, who are the least, the most, equal, or special?

**1170.**  **Answer:**  Gautama! The least beings are those with Shukla Leshya. Those with Padma Leshya are numerous times more than them. Those with Tejo Leshya are numerous times more than those with Padma Leshya. The Aleshya are infinitely more than those with Tejo Leshya. Those with Kapoth Leshya are infinitely more than the Aleshya. Those with Neel Leshya are special compared to those with Kapoth Leshya. Those with Krishna Leshya are special compared to those with Neel Leshya. And the Seleshya are special compared to those with Krishna Leshya.

**Discussion:**  This sutra discusses the relative abundance of Seleshya, Aleshya, and other beings. The beings with Shukla Leshya are considered the least because...

Those with *padma-leśyā* are said to be more numerous than them, because *padma-leśyā* is found in the *pañcendriya-tiryancha*, humans, and the kalpas called Sanatkumāra, Mahendra, and Brahmaloka.  Those with *tejo-leśyā* are said to be more numerous than those with *padma-leśyā* because *tejo-leśyā* is found in the *bādar-pṛthvīkāyika* (earth-bodied beings), *bādar-apkāyika* (water-bodied beings), all *vanaspatikāyika* (plant-bodied beings), and in a number equal to the *pañcendriya-tiryancha*, humans, Bhavanapati, Vāṇavyantara-jyotiṣka, Saudharma, and Iśāna gods.  Those with *aleśyā* are said to be infinitely more numerous than those with *tejo-leśyā* because the Siddhas are infinite and they have *aleśyā*.  Those with *kapota-leśyā* are infinitely more numerous than those with *aleśyā* because the *vanaspatikāyika* beings with *kapota-leśyā* are infinite.  Those with *klista* (afflicted) and *klista-tara* (more afflicted) *adhyavasāya* (determination) are relatively more numerous, therefore those with *nīla-leśyā* are more numerous than those with *kapota-leśyā*, and those with *kṛṣṇa-leśyā* are more numerous than those with *nīla-leśyā*.  The relative abundance of the twenty-four *daṇḍaka-varti* beings with various *leśyā* is as follows:

Among the *nāraka* (hell beings) with *kṛṣṇa-leśyā*, *nīla-leśyā*, and *kapota-leśyā*, which are the least, which are the most, which are equal, and which are more numerous?"  [1171 A.]  "O Gautama! The *nāraka* with *kṛṣṇa-leśyā* are the least, those with *nīla-leśyā* are *asankhyeya-guṇa* (innumerable times) more numerous than them, and those with *kapota-leśyā* are *asankhyeya-guṇa* more numerous than them."

**1172.**  [1172 Q.]  "O Bhagavan! Among the *tiryancha-yonika* (animal beings) with *kṛṣṇa-leśyā* up to *śukla-leśyā*, which are the least, which are the most, which are equal, and which are more numerous?"  [1172 A.]  "O Gautama! The *tiryancha* with *śukla-leśyā* are the least, and so on, as explained in the previous sūtra 1170.  It should be understood in the same way here.  The special point is that one should not say that there are *aleśyā* among the *tiryancha* (because it is not possible for them to have *aleśyā*)."

## Seventeenth Leshya Pada / Second Uddeshak [277]

**The number of Narakas with Neel Leshya is countless times more than those with Sattaharva Leshya because Neel Leshya is found in some Narakas of the third, fourth, and fifth earths, and these Narakas are countless times more than the aforementioned Narakas.**

**The number of Narakas with Kapoth Leshya is countless times more than those with Neel Leshya because Kapoth Leshya is found in the first and second earths, and in some Narakas of the third earth, and these Narakas are countless times more than the aforementioned Narakas.**

**The statement about the small number of Tiryanchas is similar to the statement about the small number of Sleshya beings, but there is a difference. The statement about the small number of Tiryanchas also includes the small number of Aleshya beings, which is not applicable to Tiryanchas because Aleshya is not possible in Tiryanchas.**

**Review of the small number of Ekendriya beings - There are only four Leshyas found in Ekendriya beings - Krishna, Neel, Kapoth, and Tejas.**

**Therefore, the small number of Ekendriya beings is only shown here for these four Leshyas.**

**The number of Ekendriya beings with Tejo Leshya is the least because Tejo Leshya is found only in the insufficient state of some Badar Prithvi Kayika, Apkayika, and Vanaspatikayika beings.**

**The number of Ekendriya beings with Kapoth Leshya is countless times more than those with Tejo Leshya because Kapoth Leshya is found in countless subtle and Badar Nigod beings.**

**The number of Ekendriya beings with Neel Leshya is more than those with Kapoth Leshya, and the number of Ekendriya beings with Krishna Leshya is more than those with Neel Leshya, according to the aforementioned logic.**

**The small number of Prithvi-Jal-Vanaspatikayika beings is similar to that of the Ekendriya beings because they have four Leshyas. Tejas Kayika and Vayu Kayika beings have only three Leshyas - Krishna, Neel, and Kapoth. Therefore, the small number of Tejas Kayika and Vayu Kayika beings is mentioned for the remaining three Leshyas, excluding Tejo Leshya.**

**The number of Kapoth Leshya beings is the least, followed by Neel Leshya beings, and then Krishna Leshya beings.**

**This small number is also mentioned for Vikalendriya beings.**

**The small number of Panchendriya Tiryanchas with Krishnaadi Leshya is similar to the small number of Tiryanchas in general, but while the number of Kapoth Leshya Tiryanchas is mentioned as countless in the general statement, the number of Kapoth Leshya Panchendriya Tiryanchas cannot be countless, but they are countless times more because even all the Panchendriya Tiryanchas together are countless.**

**Along with this sutra for general Panchendriya Tiryanchas, there are nine more sutras for eight specific Panchendriya Tiryanchas and one for general Tiryanchas -**

**(2) Sammuchhim Panchendriya Tiryanchas, (3) Garbhja Panchendriya Tiryanchas, (4) Garbhja Panchendriya Tiryanchas, females, (5) Combined Garbhja Panchendriya Tiryanchas and Sammuchhim Panchendriya Tiryanchas, (6) Sammuchhim Panchendriya Tiryanchas and Tiryancha females, (7) Garbhja Panchendriya Tiryanchas and Tiryancha females, (8) Sammuchhim and Garbhja**

The combined alpabahutva of (9) the five-sense beings and the female beings, (10) the five-sense beings and the female beings, and (11) the beings and the female beings.

**A special point to note is that the number of females is greater in all the leśyās.  It is also the view of the theoreticians that the number of female beings is three times and three more than the number of male beings. This is the reason why the female beings are said to be more numerous in the seventh alpabahutva. Then, after the seventh, in the ninth alpabahutva, the five-sense beings are also said to be more numerous. After that, in the tenth alpabahutva, the number of female beings is also stated to be greater.  **

**In the alpabahutva of humans, the alpabahutva of the five-sense beings is special.  Although the statements about the alpabahutva of humans are almost the same as the alpabahutva of the five-sense beings, humans do not have the tenth alpabahutva, because there cannot be an infinite number of humans.  Therefore, the statement "Kāpota-leśyā bāle anantaguṇe" is not possible in humans. **

**The alpabahutva of the gods in the four nikāyas:**

**(1) The alpabahutva of the Samuccaya gods:** The gods with the least śukla-leśyā are the fewest because śukla-leśyā is found only in the higher devlokas like Lāntaka, etc.  The padma-leśyā gods are countless times more than the śukla-leśyā gods because padma-leśyā exists in the Sanatkumāra, Mahendra, and Brahmaloka kalpas, and the gods there are countless times more than the gods of the Lāntaka-kalpa, etc.  The kāpota-leśyā gods are countless times more than the padma-leśyā gods because kāpota-leśyā is found in the Bhavanavāsī and Vāṇavyantara gods, who are countless times more than them.  The nīla-leśyā gods are more numerous than them because nīla-leśyā is found in many Bhavanavāsīs and Vāṇavyantaras.  The kṛṣṇa-leśyā gods are more numerous than the nīla-leśyā gods because kṛṣṇa-leśyā is found in most Bhavanapatis and Vāṇavyantara gods.  The tejo-leśyā gods are more numerous than all of them because tejo-leśyā is present in many Bhavanavāsīs, all the Jyotiṣka gods, and the Saudharma-Aiśāna gods. **

**(2) The alpabahutva of the Samuccaya goddesses:** The goddesses with kāpota-leśyā are the fewest because kāpota-leśyā is found in the Bhavanavāsī and Vyantara goddesses.  The goddesses with nīla-leśyā are more numerous than them because nīla-leśyā is found in many Bhavanavāsī and Vāṇavyantara goddesses.  The goddesses with kṛṣṇa-leśyā are more numerous than them because kṛṣṇa-leśyā is found in most Bhavanapatis, Vāṇavyantara, etc.

**Chapter 17, Section 2: The Second Object**

[279] Among the goddesses, there are very few with Krishna-leshya. Compared to them, the goddesses with Tejo-leshya are far more numerous, because Tejo-leshya is found in all the Jyotishka goddesses and in the Saudharma and Aishana goddesses. One thing to note is that goddesses are only born up to the Saudharma and Aishana kalpas, not beyond. Therefore, only four leshyas are possible in them, corresponding to these kalpas. This is why their scarcity is mentioned only up to Tejo-leshya.

(3) The number of goddesses is greater than the number of gods - This is a theoretical fact that the number of goddesses is 32 times greater than the number of gods, and 32 more. This is why the goddesses are far more numerous, or even exceptionally numerous, compared to the gods with Kapota, Neel, Krishna, and Tejo-leshya.

The scarcity of Tejo-leshya Jyotishka gods and goddesses - Only one scarcity formula is mentioned here in relation to Jyotishka gods, because only Tejo-leshya exists in the Jyotishka group, no other leshya. This is why separate scarcity formulas for Jyotishka gods and goddesses are not specified.

The consideration of Riddhi-scarcity in ordinary beings and the 24 Dandakas with leshya.

1161. "Bhagavan! Among these beings, from those with Krishna-leshya to those with Shukla-leshya, who are less wealthy or more wealthy in terms of Riddhi?"

"Gautama! Those with Neel-leshya are more wealthy than those with Krishna-leshya, those with Kapota-leshya are more wealthy than those with Neel-leshya, those with Tejo-leshya are more wealthy than those with Kapota-leshya, those with Padma-leshya are more wealthy than those with Tejo-leshya, and those with Shukla-leshya are more wealthy than those with Padma-leshya. Beings with Krishna-leshya are the least wealthy, and beings with Shukla-leshya are the most wealthy."

1192. "Bhagavan! Among these Narakas with Krishna-leshya, Neel-leshya, and Kapota-leshya, who are less wealthy or more wealthy in terms of Riddhi?"

"Gautama! Those with Neel-leshya are more wealthy than those with Krishna-leshya, those with Kapota-leshya are more wealthy than those with Neel-leshya. Narakas with Krishna-leshya are the least wealthy, and Narakas with Kapota-leshya are the most wealthy."

Among these Tiryanchayonis, which ones are less powerful or more powerful, from those with a Krishna-leshya to those with a Sukkla-leshya? [1163 u. Gautama! Just as the aggregate beings (in comparison to the Krishna-leshya etc.) are said to be less powerful or more powerful, in the same way, the Tiryanchayonis (in comparison to the Krishna-leshya etc.) should be said to be less powerful or more powerful. 1164.

All Ekendriya Tiryanchayonis with a Kanha-leshya are the least powerful, and those with a Teu-leshya are the most powerful. [1164 pr.] Bhagavan! Among the Ekendriya Tiryanchayonis, which ones are less powerful or more powerful, from those with a Krishna-leshya to those with a Tejo-leshya? [1194 u.] Gotama!

The least powerful are the Ekendriya Tiryanchayonis with a Krishna-leshya, and the most powerful are the Ekendriya with a Tejo-leshya. 1165. In the same way, the Pṛthvīkāyikas  /  [1195] In the same way (like the less powerful and more powerful of the general Ekendriya Tiryancha, the Krishna-leshya etc. four-leshya-specific) Pṛthvīkāyikas (should be understood in terms of less powerful and more powerful). 1166. In this way, with this understanding, just as the leshyas are considered, in the same way, it should be understood up to the Charidya  /  [1196] In this way, up to the four-sensory beings, the less powerful and more powerful should be understood according to this (previously mentioned) Palāpaka, in the same order as the leshyas are considered.

## Seventeenth Leshyapad: Second Uddeshak

[281 1167. Of the Panchendriya Tiryanchas, Tiryancha women, Sammuchhimas, and Garbhajas, those with Krishna Leshya are the least intelligent, and those with Shukla Leshya are the most intelligent. [1197] Similarly, among the Vaimanika Devas, those with Tejo Leshya are the least intelligent, and those with Shukla Leshya are the most intelligent. (Here, the statement of least and most intelligence should be made.) 1168. Some Acharyas say that the statement of Riddhi should be made by taking the twenty-four Dandakas.  //  The second Uddeshak is complete. [1198]

**Explanation:**

In the eight sutras (1191 to 1198) presented in this section, the concept of least and most intelligence is discussed for both ordinary beings and the twenty-four Dandakas, who are distinguished by their Krishna and other Leshyas. The conclusion is that those with lower Leshyas are less intelligent, and those with higher Leshyas are more intelligent. Similarly, in the case of Narakas, Tiryanchas, Manusyas, and Devas, one should understand the order of least and most intelligence by considering the Leshyas they possess. From Prakayikas to Chaturindriya beings, those with Krishna Leshya are the least Riddhi-possessing, and those with Tejo Leshya are the most Riddhi-possessing. This should be stated universally.  //  Seventeenth Leshyapad: Second Uddeshak complete.  /  /  1. Prajnapanasutra Malaya. Vritti, Patranka 252

## Seventeenth Leshya Pada: Third Uddeshak

[This arises in 283, because the lifespan of the hell-bound is the cause of the hell-realm. Therefore, when the lifespan of a hell-bound being arises, then the being attains the hell-realm, and when the lifespan of a human being arises, then the human realm is attained. Therefore, from the perspective of the Riju Sutra Nay, at the very first moment of the experience of the lifespan of a hell-bound being, the term "hell-bound" etc. begins to be used. 2. The second question is related to "Udvartan". It means that a being different from a hell-bound being (Anarak) emerges from the hell-realm (from the hell-bound beings). This means that as long as the lifespan of a hell-bound being is present, then it is called a "hell-bound being", and when the lifespan of a hell-bound being is no longer present, then it is called "Anarak" (different from a hell-bound being). Therefore, as long as the lifespan of a hell-bound being is present, no being can emerge from hell. For this reason, it is said that a hell-bound being does not emerge from hell, but only the being who is "Anarak" (whose lifespan of a hell-bound being is no longer present) emerges from hell. The conclusion is that when the lifespan of the next realm arises, the being emerges from the current realm, and the being is called by the name of the realm whose lifespan is present. Similarly, one should understand the production and emergence of the remaining 23 Dandakas, such as Asura Kumar etc. ]

**[285 [5]  Teu Vau Evam Chev / Navaran Etesi Teuleassa Nasthi / [1203-5]**  This is also the case for the Tejaskaayikas and Vayukaayikas (regarding their birth and death), but the special point is that they do not have Tejo-leshya.

**[1204] Biy-Tiy Charindia Evam Chev Tisu Leshasu / [1204]**  The birth and death of the Dwindriya, Triindriya and Chaturindriya beings should also be understood in the same way, in all three (Krishna, Neel and Kapoot) Leshyas.

**[1205] Panchendriya Tirikkhajonia Manasa Ya Jaha Pudhavikkaaiya Shradilliyasu Tisu Leshasu Bhania (Su. 1203 [1-2]) Taha Chasu Vi La Sasubhanianva / Navaran Chhappi Lesaano Chariyavvaapro / [1205]**  The birth and death of the Panchendriya Tirikkhajonia and Manushya beings is also the same in all six Leshyas, as it is stated in the three initial Leshyas (in Su. 1203-1-2) for the Prithvikaayikas. The special point is that (instead of the previous three Leshyas) the statement (abhilaap) should be made for all six Leshyas.

**[1206] Vanamantara Jaha Asurkumara (Su. 1202) / [1206]**  The birth and death of the Vanamantara Devas (as stated in Su. 1202) should be understood in the same way as the Asurkumara (beings).

**[1207 [1] Se Goonan Bhanta! Teuleasse Joisiye Teul Sesu Joisiyesu Uvvajati? Jahev Asurkumara. [1207-1 Pra.] Bhagavan! Does the Jyotishka Deva with Tejo-leshya get born in the Jyotishka Devas with Tejo-leshya? (Does he die with Tejo-leshya?) [1207-1 U.]**  The same statement should be understood for the Jyotishkas, as it is stated for the Asurkumara.

**[1207-2] Evam Vaimania Vi / Navaran Donh Vi Chayanthiti Abhilaavo. [1207-2]**  The same should be said for the birth and death of the Vaimaniya Devas. The special point is that for both types of Devas (Jyotishka and Vaimaniya), the statement should be "they die" instead of "they are reborn".

**Discussion:**  These seven sutras (Su. 1201 to 1207) present the pattern of birth and death of the twenty-four-dandaka-varti beings, considering the Leshya. The birth and death of Narakas and Devas follow the rule that a being is born in the same Leshya as it was in before, and dies with the same Leshya.

Page #874:
---------------------------
##  [286] [The Prajñāpanā Sūtra states:] For example, a hell-being with a black *leśyā* is born among hell-beings with a black *leśyā*, and when he is reborn, he is reborn with a black *leśyā*, not with any other *leśyā*. The reason for this is that, before the final moment of the destruction of the five senses of a *tiryañc* or a human, he becomes associated with the same *leśyā* with which he is going to be born in the hell. Afterwards, he experiences the suffering of the hell-life with the same unchangeable result. Therefore, it is said: "A hell-being with a black *leśyā* is born only among hell-beings with a black *leśyā*, not among hell-beings with other *leśyā*. Afterwards, he remains with a black *leśyā* there, his *leśyā* does not change; because the *leśyā* of gods and hell-beings does not change until the destruction of their *bhavacakra*. Similarly, a hell-being with a blue *leśyā* or a pigeon-grey *leśyā* is born among hell-beings with the same *leśyā*, not among those with other *leśyā*, and a hell-being with another *leśyā* is not born among those with a blue or pigeon-grey *leśyā*. The same rule applies to the rebirth of hell-beings: a hell-being born among those with a blue *leśyā* is reborn from there with a blue *leśyā*, not with any other *leśyā*.

Regarding the rebirth of earth-bodied beings, etc.: This rule is not absolute for earth-bodied *tiryañc* and humans, that they are reborn with the same *leśyā* among those with which they were born. They may be reborn with a black *leśyā*, or with a blue *leśyā*, or with a pigeon-grey *leśyā*, or they may be reborn with the same *leśyā* among those with which they were born. The reason for this is that the *leśyā* result of *tiryañc* and humans remains stable only for a moment, after which it changes. Therefore, an earth-bodied being, etc., who is born with a certain *leśyā*, may be reborn with the same *leśyā*, or he may be reborn with another *leśyā*. An earth-bodied being is born with a radiant *leśyā*, but he is not reborn with a radiant *leśyā*. The reason for this is that when the gods of the *bhavanavāsī*, *vāṇavyantar*, *jyotiṣka*, and *saudharm-īśān* kalpas are born as earth-bodied beings after abandoning their *bhavacakra* with a radiant *leśyā*, they have a radiant *leśyā* for some time in their incomplete state, but afterwards, the radiant *leśyā* does not remain, because earth-bodied beings are unable to absorb substances suitable for a radiant *leśyā* due to their own nature of *bhavacakra*. It is said in this sense that an earth-bodied being is born with a radiant *leśyā*, but he is not reborn with a radiant *leśyā*.

Four statements about the *apkāyika*, etc., like the earth-bodied beings: Just as four statements have been made about the black, blue, pigeon-grey, and radiant *leśyā* of earth-bodied beings, so also four statements should be made about the *apkāyika* and *vanaspatikāyika*, because they also have a radiant *leśyā* in their incomplete state.

**[287]** **Three statements about Tejaskaayikas, Vaayukaayikas and Vikalendriyas:** Tejaskaayikas, Vaayukaayikas and Vikalendriyas do not have Tejo-leshya, because it is not possible.

**[1208]** **Question:** Venerable Sir! Does a Nairyik with Krishna-leshya, Neel-leshya and Kapoot-leshya respectively, arise from Nairyikas with Krishna-leshya, Neel-leshya and Kapoot-leshya? Does he (respectively) arise from there with Krishna-leshya, Neel-leshya and Kapoot-leshya? (In other words) (Does the Narak who is born with a particular Leshya, die with the same Leshya?)

**[1208] Answer:** Yes, Gautama! (He respectively) does not have Krishna-leshya, Neel-leshya and Kapoot-leshya, and the Narak who is born with a particular Leshya, dies with the same Leshya.

**[1206]** **Question:** Venerable Sir! Does an Asurakumar with Krishna-leshya, or Tejo-leshya, arise from Asurakumars with Krishna-leshya, or Tejo-leshya? (And does he arise from Asurakumars with Krishna-leshya or Tejo-leshya?)

**[1206] Answer:** Yes, Gautama! Just as it was said about the birth and death of a Nairyik (in Sutra 1208), the same should be said about an Asurakumar, or a Thanikumar.

**[1210-1] Answer:** Yes, Gautama! A Prithvikaayik with Krishna-leshya, or Tejo-leshya, arises from Prithvikaayikas with Krishna-leshya, or Tejo-leshya. He arises with Krishna-leshya, or Neel-leshya, or Kapoot-leshya, or with the same Leshya with which he was born. He arises with Tejo-leshya, if he was born with Tejo-leshya.

[288] [Prajñāpanasūtra]  From what leśyā is a being born, from that same leśyā does it arise?  Just as this question has been asked about the Asurakumāras, so too should it be understood here.  [1210-1 U.] Yes, Gautama!  A being born as a Pṛthvīkāyika with a kṛṣṇaleśyā or a tejo-leśyā, (respectively) is born among Pṛthvīkāyikas with a kṛṣṇaleśyā or a tejo-leśyā, (but a Pṛthvīkāyika born with a kṛṣṇaleśyā) may arise with a kṛṣṇaleśyā, may arise with a nīlaleśyā, and may arise with a kāpota-leśyā, or may arise with the same leśyā with which it was born.  (Specifically, it) is born with a tejo-leśyā, but does not arise with a tejo-leśyā.  [2]  And in the same way, it should be said about the Apkāyikas and the Vanaspatikāyikas.  [1210-2]  [3]  Sir, does a Tejas-kāyika with a kṛṣṇaleśyā, a nīlaleśyā, or a kāpota-leśyā, (respectively) arise among Tejas-kāyikas with a kṛṣṇaleśyā, a nīlaleśyā, or a kāpota-leśyā?  Does it arise with a kṛṣṇaleśyā, a nīlaleśyā, or a kāpota-leśyā?  Does it arise with the same leśyā with which it was born?  [1210-3 Pr.]  Yes, Gautama!  A Tejas-kāyika with a kṛṣṇaleśyā, a nīlaleśyā, or a kāpota-leśyā, (respectively) is born among Tejas-kāyikas with a kṛṣṇaleśyā, a nīlaleśyā, or a kāpota-leśyā, but may arise with a kṛṣṇaleśyā, may arise with a nīlaleśyā, may arise with a kāpota-leśyā.  (That is) it may arise with the same leśyā with which it was born, (or it may arise with a different leśyā).  [4]  And in the same way, it should be said about the Vāyukāyikas, the Dwīndriya, the Trīndriya, and the Caturindriya beings.  [1210-4]  [1211]  Sir, does a being with a kṛṣṇaleśyā or a śuklaleśyā, (respectively) arise among the Pañcendriya-tirikṣajōṇis with a kṛṣṇaleśyā or a śuklaleśyā?  Question.

Seventeenth Leshyayad: Third Objective (289)

**Question:** (1211) O Bhagavan! Does a being with Krishna Leshya, or a being with Shukla Leshya, arise in the five-sense Tiryancha Yoni (respectively) of those with Krishna Leshya, or those with Shukla Leshya? And does it die with the same Krishna Leshya, etc.?

**Answer:** (1211) Yes, Gautama! A being with Krishna Leshya, or a being with Shukla Leshya, arises in the five-sense Tiryancha Yoni (respectively) of those with Krishna Leshya, or those with Shukla Leshya. But it may die with Krishna Leshya, or it may die with Neel Leshya, or it may die with Shukla Leshya. (In other words) it may die with the same Leshya with which it was born, or it may die with a different Leshya. (1212) Similarly, a human being should be understood in the same way (as the five-sense Tiryancha, arising and dying in any of the six Leshyas). (1213) The Asura Kumaras should be understood in the same way as the Vanavyantara Devas (as described in Sutra 1206). (1214) The Jyotishka and Vaimanika Devas should also be understood in the same way (as the Asura Kumaras). The special point is that one should mention the number of Leshyas that a being has, and for both (Jyotishkas and Vaimanikas), the word "chyavan" should be used instead of "udvartana".

**Explanation:** The seven Sutras (1208 to 1214) describe the collective birth and death of the twenty-four-dandaka beings in relation to Leshya. These Sutras collectively describe the birth and death of each dandaka being, taking into account the possible Leshyas of each dandaka being.

**Reason for Repetition:** Although the birth and death of each dandaka being, from Narakas to Vaimanikas, has been described in the previous Sutras (1201 to 1207), taking into account one Leshya for each dandaka being, it is possible that the situation may be different in the case of many Narakas with different Leshyas, because one...

[291] Gotama! He knows and sees a *bahutaraaga* (very large) *field*, he knows and sees a *durataraaga* (farther) *field*, he knows and sees a *vitimirataraga* (without delusion) *field*, he knows and sees a *visuddhataraaga* (perfectly pure) *field*. [Pr.] Bhagavan! Why is it said that a *Nila-leshya* hell-being knows and sees a *field* up to the *visuddhataraaga* level, compared to a *Krishna-leshya* hell-being? [U.] Gotama! Just as a man climbs a mountain from a very beautiful and pleasant land, and after climbing the mountain, he looks around in all directions and sub-directions, then that man knows and sees a *bahutaraaga* *field* compared to a man on the ground, up to the *visuddhataraaga* *field*. Therefore, Gotama! It is said that a *Nila-leshya* hell-being knows and sees a *field* up to the *visuddhataraaga* level, compared to a *Krishna-leshya* hell-being. [3] Gotama! How much *field* does a *Kaula-leshya* (white-leshya) hell-being know and see, compared to a *Nila-leshya* hell-being? [3] Gotama!

[292] [From the Prajnapana, it is said that the Kapoteleshya Naraka sees (knows) a greater area than the Nillaleshya Naraka, in all directions, by means of Avadhi (knowledge). How much greater area does he see (know)?] - [1215-3 Pr.]  O Bhagavan! How much greater area does the Kapoteleshya Naraka see (know) in all directions, by means of Avadhi (knowledge), compared to the Nillaleshya Naraka? [1215-3 U.] Gautama! (He, the Kapoteleshya Naraka, compared to the Nillaleshya Naraka) sees (knows) a greater area, sees (knows) a farther area, and sees (knows) the area in a more purified (clearer) way. [Pr.] O Bhagavan! Why is it said that the Kapoteleshya Naraka, "...sees (knows) the area in a more purified (clearer) way?" [U.] Gautama! Just as a man climbs a mountain from a very even and beautiful land, then climbs a tree from the mountain, and then raises both his feet on the tree and sees (knows) in all directions, he sees (knows) a great area, sees (knows) a greater area, and sees (knows) the area in a more purified (clearer) way. For this reason, O Gautama! It is said that the Kapoteleshya Naraka, compared to the Nillaleshya Naraka, ...sees (knows) a greater area in a more purified (clearer) way. Discussion—The gradation of seeing (knowing) by means of Avadhi knowledge in the Narakas of Krishnadi-leshya. In this Sutra (1215-1, 2, 3), the gradation of seeing (knowing) by means of Avadhi knowledge in the Narakas of Krishnadi-leshya is described. There is not much difference in seeing (knowing) by means of Avadhi knowledge between two Krishna-leshya Narakas—a Krishna-leshya Naraka does not see (know) a much greater area than another Krishna-leshya Naraka, he sees (knows) only a slightly greater area. The meaning of this statement is that a Krishna-leshya Naraka, even if he is more purified in his qualities than another Krishna-leshya Naraka, does not see (know) a much greater distant area by means of Avadhi knowledge, but only sees (knows) a slightly greater area. This statement should be understood in relation to the Narakas of the same Naraka-earth, because the Krishna-leshya Naraka of the seventh Naraka knows the lowest half a village and the highest one village, while the Krishna-leshya Naraka of the sixth Naraka knows the lowest one village and the highest one and a half villages; the Krishna-leshya Naraka of the fifth and sixth Naraka-earth knows the lowest one and a half villages and the highest slightly less than two villages. Thus, there would be a fault in the seeing (knowing) of the Krishna-leshya Narakas of different earths; therefore, this statement is true in relation to the Krishna-leshya Narakas of the same Naraka-earth. The reason for not seeing (knowing) more is that, just as two people standing on level ground and looking around, one of them may see more due to the clarity of his eyes, but he can only see (know) a slightly greater area, not a much greater distance. Similarly, a Krishna-leshya Naraka, even if he is more purified than another Naraka according to his qualities, can only see (know) a slightly greater area, not a much greater area. ' 1.

**(1)** Just as a person climbing a mountain from a flat terrain sees the area more clearly and distinctly than a person standing on the ground, similarly, a Naraka with Neelaleshya, through his Avadhijnana, sees the area much farther and more clearly than a Naraka with Krishnaaleshya who is situated on the ground.

**(2)** Just as a person climbing a mountain from a flat terrain and then climbing a tree there, with both feet raised, sees the area much farther and more clearly than the people standing on the ground and on the mountain, similarly, a person with Kapoteleshya situated on the chest, through his Avadhijnana, sees the area much farther and more clearly than a person with Neelaleshya situated on the mountain and a person with Krishnaaleshya situated on the ground.

**Knowledge in beings with Krishna etc. Leshya** 1216. [1] "O Lord! In how many knowledges does a being with Krishnaaleshya exist?" [1216-1 U] "Gautama! He exists in two, three or four knowledges. If he exists in two (knowledges), then he exists in Prabhinibodhik and Shruta Jnana. If he exists in three (knowledges), then he exists in Prabhinibodhik, Shruta and Avadhi Jnana. Or, if he exists in three (knowledges), then he exists in Prabhinibodhik, Shruta and Manahparyav Jnana. And if he exists in four knowledges, then he exists in Prabhinibodhik Jnana, Shruta Jnana, Avadhi Jnana and Manahparyav Jnana." [1216-1 Pr]

[1216-2] Similarly, one should understand the types of knowledge in beings with Neel, Kapoth and Tejo Leshya, up to Padma Leshya, according to the above mentioned formula.

1217. "O Lord! In how many knowledges does a being with Shukla Leshya exist?" [1217 Pr] "Gautama! He exists in two, three, four or one. If he exists in two, then he exists in Prabhinibodhik Jnana and..." [1217-1] Just as in the case of Krishnaaleshya (Su. 1226 [1]), similarly, one should understand the types of knowledge in beings with Neel, Kapoth and Tejo Leshya, up to Padma Leshya. If he exists in one, then he exists in one Kevala Jnana.

##  [294] [Prajñāpanasūtra [1217 U.]] Gautama! A jīva with śuklaleśyā can have two, three, four, or one knowledge. If it has two (knowledges), then it has ābhinibodikjñāna and śruta-jñāna. If it has three or four knowledges, then it is as stated for those with kṛṣṇaleśyā in [Sūtra 1216-1], and so on up to four knowledges. It should be said that if it has one knowledge, then it has one kevalajñāna. 

**Discussion:** In the two sūtras [1216-1217] presented here, which deal with the form of knowledge in jīvas with kṛṣṇā-ādi-leśyā, it has been established how many knowledges a jīva with kṛṣṇaleśyā to śuklaleśyā has. 

**Absence of Avadhijñāna:** In some cases, there is also manaḥparyāyajñāna without avadhijñāna. This has been stated many times in texts like "Siddhāprābhūta" etc. The materials for the destruction and pacification of each knowledge are different. A person with a pure conduct, free from negligence, and possessing attainments like āmarṣa-prauṣadhi etc., obtains the materials for the destruction and pacification of the manaḥparyāyajñāna-āvaraṇa in a specific, pure determination. However, they do not obtain the materials for the destruction and pacification of the avadhijñāna-āvaraṇa. They have manaḥparyāyajñāna even without avadhijñāna. 

**Manaḥparyāyajñāna in Kṛṣṇaleśyā:** There may be a doubt here: manaḥparyāyajñāna occurs in a person with an extremely pure result, and kṛṣṇaleśyā is a form of result that is full of saṃkleśa. How can a jīva with kṛṣṇaleśyā have manaḥparyāyajñāna? The solution is that the places of determination for each leśyā are as numerous as the loka-ākāśa-pradeśas. Among them, there are some places of determination with weak experiences, which are found in the state of pramatta-saṃyata. Although manaḥparyāyajñāna is produced only in a jīva with apratmatta-saṃyata, after being produced, it remains even in the state of pramatta. From this perspective, a jīva with kṛṣṇaleśyā can also be a manaḥparyāyajñānī.

**Characteristics of Śuklaleśyā:** A jīva with śuklaleśyā can also have kevalajñāna. Kevalajñāna is only for śuklaleśyā, not for any other. This is the characteristic that distinguishes a jīva with śuklaleśyā from those with other leśyās.

[298] When the substance of the black karma (Krishna-leshya) comes into contact with the substance of the blue karma (Nila-leshya), it transforms into the nature of the blue karma (Nila-leshya). This means that the nature of the black karma (Krishna-leshya) changes into the nature of the blue karma (Nila-leshya). How does this transformation of nature occur? It is explained in detail: The black karma (Krishna-leshya) transforms into the color, smell, taste, and touch of the blue karma (Nila-leshya). This transformation occurs many times. This means that when a human being or a non-human being (tiryanch) who is destined to experience the black karma (Krishna-leshya) is about to enter another existence (bhavanter) and receives the substances of the blue karma (Nila-leshya), then through contact with the substances of the blue karma (Nila-leshya), they acquire the substances and form of the blue karma (Nila-leshya) along with the cooperative cause of the living being's transformation. This is because the karmic particles (pudgala) have the nature of transforming in various ways. Subsequently, the living being is born into another existence (bhavanter) after experiencing the blue karma (Nila-leshya) due to contact with the substances of the blue karma (Nila-leshya). This is a principle statement: "The living being is born with the same karma (leshya) that it experienced when it died (kal)." Similarly, when a non-human being or a human being who is existing in the same existence (bhavanter) transforms from the black karma (Krishna-leshya) into the nature of the blue karma (Nila-leshya), the substances of the black karma (Krishna-leshya) immediately transform into the substances of the blue karma (Nila-leshya) due to contact with the substances of the blue karma (Nila-leshya) that they have already acquired. This fact is explained through an example: Just as milk changes its color, smell, taste, and touch when it comes into contact with sour substances like buttermilk, and it transforms into the color, smell, taste, and touch of buttermilk, similarly, a white cloth changes its color when it comes into contact with blood or any other color. In the same way, the nature of the substances of the black karma (Krishna-leshya) and their color, smell, etc., transform into the color, etc., of the blue karma (Nila-leshya) due to contact with the substances of the blue karma (Nila-leshya). Here, it is assumed that the karmic substances of non-human beings and humans completely transform into their respective forms. The karmic substances of gods and hell beings remain permanent until the end of their existence (bhavanter). The transformation of previous karmas (leshya) into subsequent karmas (leshya) is explained in sutras 1220-1221: Previous karmas (leshya) transform into the color, etc., of subsequent karmas (leshya) when they come into contact with them. The transformation of any one karma (leshya) into the form of all other karmas (leshya) is explained in sutras 1222-1225: Any one karma (leshya) can transform into the color, smell, etc., of any other karma (leshya) in a sequential or reverse order. However, it is important to note that no one karma (leshya) can transform into multiple karmas (leshya) simultaneously due to their opposing nature. How does one karma (leshya) transform into the form of one of the other karmas (leshya)? An example in this regard is that just as a single lapis lazuli gem transforms into different forms due to contact with different substances, similarly, one karmic substance (leshya) also transforms into forms like black (Krishna), blue (Nila), etc. The similarity in the example should be understood in this context. It should not be applied to other undesirable aspects. - Prajna. M. V., 6. 359 1. Jallesai dabwai pariaitta kalan karei, tal leshe uvavjjai. 2. Prajnapanasuy malaya. vatthi, patranka 359-360 3.

Why are the five adjectives "anishṭatar" (most undesirable) and others used for Krishna Leshya? 

The adjective "anishṭatar" is used for Krishna Leshya to indicate that it is more undesirable than even dark clouds, etc., which are mentioned as dark objects at the beginning of the rainy season. However, some objects like musk are desirable (beautiful) even though they are undesirable (dark). But Krishna Leshya is not like that. To convey this, the adjective "akāntatar" (extremely undesirable) is used for Krishna Leshya. 

Even if an object is undesirable and unattractive, it may be liked by someone. But Krishna Leshya is not even liked. To convey this, the adjective "apriyatar" (extremely unpleasant) is used for Krishna Leshya. 

For the same reason, Krishna Leshya is "amanōjatar" (extremely unpalatable). In fact, upon knowing its true nature, the mind does not consider it even slightly desirable. Some objects like bitter medicine, even though they are unpalatable, are of medium quality. But Krishna Leshya is completely unpalatable. To express this, the adjective "amanāmatar" (completely undesirable) is used for it. 

Similarly, the scholar has used these five adjectives for Neel Leshya and Kapoot Leshya. However, for the last three Leshyas, the opposite five adjectives "ishṭatar" (most desirable) etc. are used. 

The word "sāhijjanti" means "are said," "are described."

## Seventeenth Leshya-pada: Fourth Uddeshaka (5)

Two hundred forty-three (243) varieties are obtained by dividing the two hundred forty-three (243) varieties into three (3) varieties each. If such divisions and sub-divisions are made successively, then there are many, many types of transformations of Krishna-leshya. Similarly, the types of transformations should be understood up to Shukla-leshya.

**From the eleventh Pradesh-adhikār to the fourteenth sthān-adhikār, the following is the prarūpaṇā:**

**1243.** **[1243 Pr.]** Bhagavan! How many Pradesh does Krishna-leshya have? **[1243 U.]** Gautama! (Krishna-leshya) has infinite Pradesh (because the atoms eligible for Krishna-leshya are infinitely infinite in number). Similarly, (from Nila-leshya) up to Shukla-leshya (the statement of Pradesh should be made).

**1244.** **[1244 Pr.]** Bhagavan! In how many Pradesh of space is Krishna-leshya avagāḍha? **[1244 U.]** Gautama! (Krishna-leshya) is avagāḍha in countless space Pradesh. Similarly, up to Shukla-leshya, it should be understood as countless Pradesh-avagāḍha.

**1245.** **[1245 Pr.]** Bhagavan! How many vargaṇā of Krishna-leshya are mentioned? **[1245 U.]** Gautama! (Its) infinite vargaṇā are mentioned. Similarly, up to Shukla-leshya (the statement of vargaṇā should be made).

**1246.** **[1246 Pr.]** Bhagavan! How many sthān (tar-tamrupa-bheda) of Krishna-leshya are mentioned? **[1246 U.]** Gautama! Countless sthān of Krishna-leshya are mentioned. Similarly, up to Shukla-leshya (the prarūpaṇā of sthān should be made).

**Discussion:**

From the eleventh Pradesh-adhikār to the fourteenth sthān-adhikār, the prarūpaṇā of Pradesh, Pradesh-avagāḍha, vargaṇā, and sthān is presented in these four sūtras.

**Krishna-ādi Leshya are Ananta-pradeshika:**

Since the atoms eligible for each of the six Krishna-ādi Leshya are infinitely infinite, they are called Ananta-pradeshika.

## Translation:

**310] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra**

**Krishnaādi Leshyā** are countless in number and are deeply rooted in **Ākāśa Pradesh** (space). The term **Pradesh** here refers to **Ākāśa Pradesh** because **Avagāhana** (absorption) occurs only in the regions of space. Although the **Vargaṇā** (classifications) of each **Leshyā** are infinite, their absorption takes place in countless **Ākāśa Pradesh** because the entire **Lokākāśa** (cosmic space) has countless regions.

**Krishnaādi Leshyā** are endowed with infinite **Vargaṇā**.  **Vargaṇā** refers to a group of atoms suitable for **Krishna Leshyā**, similar to a group of atoms suitable for **Audārika Śarīra** (gross body) etc. These **Vargaṇā** are infinite due to differences in **Varṇa** (color) etc.

**Krishnaādi Leshyā** have countless **Leshyā Sthāna** (locations). **Sthāna** refers to the differences caused by **Prakarsha** (intensification) and **Apakarsha** (attenuation), i.e., the intensity of impurity and purity. When **Krishnaādi Leshyā** are contemplated in their form as **Bhāva** (emotions), the **Sthāna** of each **Leshyā**, in its form as **Prakarsha** and **Apakarsha**, are equal to the countless **Utsarpini** and **Avasarpini** periods of time, in relation to **Kāla** (time). In relation to **Kshetra** (space), the **Sthāna** are equal to the countless **Lokākāśa Pradesh**. It is also said that the number of **Sthāna** (alternatives) of **Leshyā** is equal to the number of periods of countless **Utsarpini** and **Avasarpini** or the number of regions of countless **Lokas** (worlds). However, it is noteworthy that the **Sthāna** of the three **Aśubha Bhāva Leshyā** (unfavorable emotional **Leshyā**) are **Sanklesha** (impure), while the **Sthāna** of the three **Śubha Bhāva Leshyā** (favorable emotional **Leshyā**) are **Viśuddha** (pure).

The **Dravya Samūha** (group of substances) that are the cause of these **Bhāva Leshyā** are also called **Sthāna**. Here, we should consider only those **Dravya Samūha** because this **Uddeshaka** (objective) deals with the **Prarūpa** (form) of **Krishnaādi Leshyā Dravya** (substances). These **Sthāna** are countless for each **Leshyā**.

**Tathāvidha** (similarly), countless **Dravya** (substances) that are the cause of a single **Pariṇāma** (transformation) are considered as one, due to their being the cause of one type of **Adhyavasāya** (determination). Each of them has two aspects: **Jaghanya** (inferior) and **Utkrisht** (superior). Those that are the cause of **Jaghanya Leshyā Sthāna** are called **Jaghanya**, and those that are the cause of **Utkrisht Leshyā Sthāna** are called **Utkrisht**. The **Madhyama Sthāna** (intermediate locations) that are adjacent to **Jaghanya Sthāna** are included in **Jaghanya**, and those that are adjacent to **Utkrisht Sthāna** are included in **Utkrisht**. These **Sthāna**, although being under the same **Mūla Sthāna** (original location), are countless due to the differences in **Pariṇāma** (transformation), **Guṇa** (qualities), and **Bheda** (differences).

In the **Ātmā** (soul), there are countless **Leshyā Pariṇāma Viśesha** (specific transformations of **Leshyā**) due to the **Upādhi** (limiting condition) of **Leshyā Dravya** (substance) with one more **Guṇa** (quality), two more **Guṇa**, etc. From a practical perspective, they are all called **Jaghanya** because they have fewer **Guṇa**. The **Sthāna** of the **Dravya** that are the cause of these **Leshyā** are also called **Jaghanya**. Similarly, the **Utkrisht Sthāna** should also be considered countless.

Goutama! The least in terms of substance (dravya) are the inferior (jhaghanya) places of kapota-leshya. The inferior places of nila-leshya are innumerable times greater in substance than them. Similarly, the inferior places of krishna-leshya, tejodhya-leshya, and padma-leshya are innumerable times greater in substance than the inferior places of shukla-leshya.

The superior (utkrishta) places of kapota-leshya are innumerable times greater in substance than the superior places of shukla-leshya. The superior places of nila-leshya are innumerable times greater in substance than the superior places of shukla-leshya. Similarly, the superior places of krishna-leshya, tejodhya-leshya, and padma-leshya are innumerable times greater in substance than the superior places of shukla-leshya.

In terms of spatial extent (pradesha), the inferior places of kapota-leshya are infinitely greater than the inferior places of shukla-leshya. The inferior places of jvala-leshya are infinitely greater than the inferior places of shukla-leshya. Similarly, it should be understood that the superior places also have the same relationship of more and less.

In terms of both substance and spatial extent, the inferior places of kapota-leshya are infinitely greater than the inferior places of shukla-leshya. The inferior places of nila-leshya are innumerable times greater than the inferior places of shukla-leshya. Similarly, the inferior places of krishna-leshya, tejodhya-leshya, and padma-leshya are innumerable times greater than the inferior places of shukla-leshya.

The superior places of kapota-leshya are infinitely greater in substance than the superior places of shukla-leshya. The superior places of nila-leshya are innumerable times greater in substance than the superior places of shukla-leshya. Similarly, the superior places of krishna-leshya, tejodhya-leshya, and padma-leshya are infinitely greater in substance than the superior places of shukla-leshya.

**Tejo-leshya, Padma-leshya and Shukla-leshya's inferior locations are innumerably times less than the substance (dravy) in comparison.**  The superior Kapota-leshya locations are innumerably times more than the inferior Shukla-leshya locations in comparison to the substance (dravy). Similarly, the superior locations of Nila-leshya, Krishna-leshya, Tejo-leshya, Padma-leshya and Shukla-leshya are innumerably times more than the substance (dravy) in comparison.

**The inferior locations of Kapota-leshya are the least in comparison to the regions (pradesha).** The inferior locations of Nila-leshya are innumerably times more than the inferior locations of Kapota-leshya in comparison to the regions (pradesha). Similarly, as the statement of less abundance has been made in comparison to the substance (dravy), so also it should be said in comparison to the regions (pradesha).

**Specifically, it should be stated in comparison to the regions (pradesha) that the inferior locations of Kapota-leshya are the least in comparison to the substance (dravy) and the regions (pradesha).** The inferior locations of Nila-leshya are innumerably times more than the inferior locations of Kapota-leshya in comparison to the substance (dravy). Similarly, the inferior locations of Krishna-leshya, Tejo-leshya, Padma-leshya and Shukla-leshya are innumerably times more than the substance (dravy) in comparison.

**The superior Kapota-leshya locations are innumerably times more than the inferior Shukla-leshya locations in comparison to the substance (dravy).** The superior locations of Nila-leshya are innumerably times more than the superior locations of Kapota-leshya in comparison to the substance (dravy). Similarly, the superior locations of Krishna-leshya, Tejo-leshya, Padma-leshya and Shukla-leshya are innumerably times more than the substance (dravy) in comparison.

**The inferior Kapota-leshya locations are infinitely times more than the superior Shukla-leshya locations in comparison to the regions (pradesha).** The inferior locations of Nila-leshya are innumerably times more than the inferior locations of Kapota-leshya in comparison to the regions (pradesha). Similarly, the inferior locations of Krishna-leshya, Tejo-leshya, Padma-leshya and Shukla-leshya are innumerably times more than the regions (pradesha) in comparison.

**The superior Kapota-leshya locations are innumerably times more than the inferior Shukla-leshya locations in comparison to the regions (pradesha).** The superior locations of Nila-leshya are innumerably times more than the superior locations of Kapota-leshya in comparison to the regions (pradesha). Similarly, the superior locations of Krishna-leshya, Tejo-leshya, Padma-leshya and Shukla-leshya are innumerably times more than the regions (pradesha) in comparison.

**Discussion:** In these three sutras, the less abundance of the inferior and superior locations of all six Leshyas has been established in comparison to the substance (dravy), the regions (pradesha), and both the substance (dravy) and the regions (pradesha).

**Conclusion:** The locations of Kapota-leshya are the least in comparison to the substance (dravy), the regions (pradesha), and both the substance (dravy) and the regions (pradesha) in the inferior and superior locations. The locations of Nila, Krishna, Tejo, Padma and Shukla-leshya are innumerably times more than them in succession. Sometimes, the locations of Kapota-leshya are said to be infinitely times more than the locations of Shukla-leshya in comparison to the regions (pradesha).

[315] It does not repeatedly transform in its color form, nor in its smell form, nor in its taste form, nor in its touch form. [Q] Bhagavan! For what reason is it said that Krishna Leshya, having attained Nila Leshya, does not repeatedly transform in its form, or in its color, smell, taste, and touch forms? [A] Gautama! It is either by the mere form of the shape, or by the mere form of the reflection (of Nila Leshya). It remains Krishna Leshya, it does not become Nila Leshya. It attains excellence while remaining there. For this reason, Gautama, it is said that Krishna Leshya, having attained Nila Leshya, does not repeatedly transform in its form, or in its color, smell, taste, and touch forms.

[1253] [Q] Bhagavan! Does Nila Leshya, having attained Kapota Leshya, not repeatedly transform in its form, or in its color, smell, taste, and touch forms? [A] Yes, Gautama! Nila Leshya, having attained Kapota Leshya, does not repeatedly transform in its form, or in its color, smell, taste, and touch forms. [Q] Bhagavan! For what reason do you say that Nila Leshya, having attained Kapota Leshya, does not repeatedly transform in its form? [A] Gautama! It is either by the mere form of the shape, or by the mere form of the reflection (of Kapota Leshya). It remains Nila Leshya, it does not become Kapota Leshya. It increases and decreases while remaining there. For this reason, Gautama, it is said that Nila Leshya, having attained Kapota Leshya, does not repeatedly transform in its form, or in its color, smell, taste, and touch forms.

[1254] In the same way, Kapota Leshya, having attained Tejo Leshya, Tejo Leshya, having attained Padma Leshya, and Padma Leshya, having attained Shukla Leshya, does not transform in its form, or in its color, smell, taste, and touch forms. (This should be understood based on the previous reasoning.)

[316] {Prajñāpanasūtra 1255.  "Complete, Venerable One! Does a white particle, having obtained a lotus particle, become transformed into its nature? " "Yes, Gautama! A white particle, having obtained a lotus particle, does not become transformed into its nature, etc. (all the same should be said as before)." [Pr.] "Venerable One! For what reason is it said that a white particle (having obtained a lotus particle) does not become transformed (into its nature and into its color, smell, taste, and touch)?" [U.] "Gautama! As long as it is only a form or only a reflection (that it appears like a lotus particle), it is (in reality) a white particle, certainly it is not a lotus particle. The white particle, remaining there (in its own nature), attains a decline (inferiority). For this reason, Gautama! It is said that it does not become transformed (into the nature of a lotus particle, having obtained it)." The fifth topic of the particle-word is complete. [1255 Pr.]  [1255 U.]  

The transformation of particles into each other is explained in these five sūtras (sū. 1251 to 1255), where it is forbidden for one particle to obtain another particle and become transformed into its nature. How and what is the solution to the contradictory statements? Here there is a doubt that in the previous sūtras (sū. 1220 to 1225, fourth topic, the right to transformation), it is ordained that black, etc. particles become transformed into the nature of blue, etc. particles and into their color, smell, taste, and touch, but here their transformation into that form is forbidden. These two statements are contradictory. What is the solution? The commentator, while solving this, says that the transformation that was ordained earlier is with respect to the animals and humans, and the transformation that is forbidden in these sūtras is with respect to the gods and the hell-beings. Thus, both statements are not contradictory because they are from different perspectives. Gods and hell-beings remain in the same particle from the last moment of their previous birth until the first moment of their next birth. That is, the particle that they had in the last moment of their previous birth remains the same in their present god-birth or hell-birth and also remains in the first moment of their next birth. For this reason, even when the substances of black, etc. particles of gods and hell-beings come into contact with each other, they do not transform each other into their own nature.

---------------------------
## Seventeenth Leshya Chapter: Fifth Objective

**Why do the 317 Leshyas not transform into each other even though they are in mutual contact?** This question is addressed in the root text. It states that the Krishna Leshya only takes on the form or reflection of the Neel Leshya, but it does not actually become Neel Leshya. The meaning of form is a mere shadow or a glimpse. The implication is that the substances of the Krishna Leshya are overshadowed by the substances of the Neel Leshya, causing it to appear like Neel Leshya. Or, like how a mirror appears to be the object reflected in it, similarly, when the Neel Leshya (proximity) is near the Krishna Leshya, the substances of the Neel Leshya are reflected on the Krishna Leshya, causing the substances of the Krishna Leshya to be reflected as the substances of the Neel Leshya. However, the transformation of cause and effect does not occur. Just as a mirror remains a mirror and does not become the object reflected in it, similarly, when the Neel Leshya is reflected on the Krishna Leshya, it appears like Neel Leshya, but in reality, it does not transform into Neel Leshya, it remains Krishna Leshya. Thus, in the sense of reflection or shadow, the transformation does not occur in the root text. 

This is the same meaning as stated in the root text: "It is truly Krishna Leshya, not Neel Leshya, because it has not abandoned its own nature." Just as a mirror, etc., while holding the mere reflection of the objects like Japa Kusuma, etc., remains a mirror, etc., and the Japa Kusuma, etc., do not become a mirror, similarly, the Krishna Leshya does not become Neel Leshya, but due to the purification of the Neel Leshya from the Krishna Leshya, the Krishna Leshya remains in its own nature, while holding the mere form or reflection of the Neel Leshya, becoming slightly purified. This is the meaning of the statement here: "Tatyagata Prossakati" - the Krishna Leshya (due to the presence of the Neel Leshya) remains in that form and attains excellence. But, the Padma Leshya, being inferior in transformation to the Shukla Leshya, becomes slightly impure by holding the mere form or reflection of the Padma Leshya due to its presence - it attains decline.

**Regarding other Leshyas:** Although the root text does not mention other Leshyas, the root commentator has explained them. Therefore, just as the statement about the Padma Leshya is made in relation to the Shukla Leshya, similarly, the statements about the Tejo Leshya, Kapota Leshya, Neel Leshya, and Krishna Leshya in relation to the Padma Leshya, the statements about the Kapota, Neel, and Krishna Leshyas in relation to the Tejo Leshya, the statements about the Neel and Krishna Leshyas in relation to the Kapota Leshya, and the statement about the Krishna Leshya in relation to the Neel Leshya should be considered.

This is the eighteenth 'Kayasthitipad' chapter of the primary *Prajnapana Sutra*.  *'Kay'* here means 'Paryaya'.  The continuous and constant existence of a being in its general or specific form (Kay) is called Kayasthiti.  This Kayasthitipad presents the contemplation of how long the twenty-four Dandakavarti beings and non-beings remain in their respective Paryayas.  The difference between the fourth 'Sthitipad' and this 'Kayasthitipad' is that the Sthitipad considers the lifespan of the twenty-four Dandakavarti beings in relation to one bhava, whereas this chapter considers the total duration of all such bhavas, or the sum of the lifespans of all those bhavas, if a being dies and is repeatedly reborn in the same bhava.  This chapter considers the duration of the twenty-four Dandakavarti beings in their respective Kays through the twenty-two doors of:  Jiva, Gati, Indriya, Kay, Yoga, Veda, Kashaya, Leshya, Samyaktva, Jnana, Darshan, Samyata, Upayoga, Prahar, Bhashak, Pareet, Paryapt, Sukshma, Sanjni, Bhavasiddhik, Astikay, and Charam.  The first door, Jiva, signifies the existence of the Jiva throughout all time, proving its indestructibility.  The second door, Gati, considers the duration of the male and female forms of the four Gatis.  The third door, Indriya, considers the duration of the beings with no senses, one sense, and so on up to five senses, in their respective Paryayas.  The fourth door, Kay, describes the duration of the beings with Taijas, Karman, or Shatkayas in their respective Paryayas.  The fifth door, Yoga, describes the duration of Manoyogi and Vachanayogi, from the shortest time of one moment to the longest time of Antarmuhurt.  The duration of Kayayogi is described as that of an excellent plant.  The sixth door, Veda, describes the duration of the Savedak, Avedak, and Stri-Purush-Napusakvedi.  The seventh door, Kashaya, describes the duration of the Sakashay, Akashay, and

The Eighteenth Kayasthitipada. [325 This considers the Kayasthiti of beings with passions like anger, etc. The Seventh Lenyadwar describes the time spent in their own Paryaya by beings with various Leshyas. The Eighth Samyaktadwar considers the Paryaya state of beings with Samyagdristi, Mithyadristi and Mishradristi. After this, the time of knowledge, vision, restraint, and use of Pahar is described in order. After this, through the doors of Bhashak, Pariit, Paryapt, Sukshma, Sanjni, Bhavasiddhik, and Charam, etc., how long do the specific beings remain in their own Paryaya? This contemplation is presented / In the Twenty-First Prastikaya Dwar, the Kayasthiti of non-living beings like Dharmaastikaya, etc. is considered. * This contemplation of Kayasthiti is extremely useful for Mumukhu beings who desire liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

## The Eighteenth Kayasthitipada

This is the eighteenth Kayasthitipada, which includes twenty-two doors. 

**The twenty-two doors are:**

1. **Jiva** (being)
2. **Gati** (motion)
3. **Indriya** (sense organs)
4. **Kaya** (body)
5. **Yoga** (union)
6. **Veda** (knowledge)
7. **Kasaya** (passions)
8. **Leshya** (tendencies)
9. **Samyaktva** (right faith)
10. **Gnan** (knowledge)
11. **Darshan** (perception)
12. **Sanjaya** (self-control)
13. **Uvag** (use)
14. **Prahare** (effort)
15. **Bhasag** (speaker)
16. **Paritt** (abandoned)
17. **Pazzatt** (sufficient)
18. **Suhum** (subtle)
19. **Sanno** (collected)
20. **Bhav** (becoming)
21. **Asti** (being)
22. **Charime** (ultimate)

**These twenty-two doors are the Kayasthiti.**

**Explanation:**

The Kayasthitipada describes the twenty-two doors of the Kayasthiti, which is the state of being. The term "Kaya" refers to the being, and it has two forms: general and specific. The general form is the state of being a being, while the specific form is the state of being a particular type of being, such as a hell being. The Kayasthiti is the state of being in either of these forms.

**The first two doors are:**

1. **Jiva** (being)
2. **Gati** (motion)

**Question:** How long does a being remain in the state of being a being?

**Answer:** A being remains in the state of being a being forever.

**Question:** How long does a hell being remain in the state of being a hell being?

**Answer:** A hell being remains in the state of being a hell being for ten thousand years.

Second Door / / 2 / / / Discussion-First-Second Jiva-Dwar-Gati-Dwar-The present eleven Sutras (Su. 1260 to 1270) describe the Kayasthiti of the general Jiva and the specific Jivas with four Gatis like Naraka, etc. Why and how is there always a continuous Jivan-paryaya in the Jiva? - The Jiva is always called the Jiva because it is characterized by the Jivan-paryaya: The meaning of life is to sustain life. There are two types of Pranas - Dravya-pranas and Bhava-pranas / Dravya-pranas are ten - 5 Indriyas, three Balas, Ucchvas-Nishvas and Aayu / Bhava-pranas - Jnana, Darshan, Veerya and Sukh, these are 4 / In the case of Samsari Jivas, the Pranadharana in the form of the experience of Aayu-karma is always present. There is no such state of Samsaris in which there is no experience of Aayu-karma. Even though the Siddha Jiva is devoid of Dravya-pranas, it always remains alive due to the harmonious state of Bhava-pranas like Jnana, etc. Therefore, there is Jivan-paryaya everywhere, both in the Samsari state and in the Mukta state, therefore, Jivan-paryaya is always present in the Jiva. Kayasthiti of Jivas in relation to Gati - The Kayasthiti of Naraka is a minimum of ten thousand years and a maximum of 33 Sagaropama, the Naraka remains in the Naraka-paryaya / This is the Kayasthiti of Naraka / Because the nature of Narakabhava is such that a Jiva who has once come out of Naraka does not take birth in Naraka again in the next Bhava. Therefore, the magnitude of their Bhavasthiti is the same as the magnitude of their Kayasthiti. Kayasthiti of Tiryanch Nar - Its Jghanya Antarmukhurta and Utkrishta Anant-kal Kayasthiti is because when a Deva, Manushya or Naraka is born as a Tiryanch-yonik Nar and remains there for Antarmukhurta-paryant and then takes birth in Deva, Manushya or Naraka Bhava, in that state, the Jghanya Kayasthiti is Antarmukhurta. Although the Kayasthiti of Tiryanch is related to one Bhava,

33.] The duration of the state of existence (sthiti) from the moment of birth (prajnapanasuna) is at most three palyopama, no more. However, those who are born in the state of being a lower animal (tiryanch) and continuously remain in the state of being a lower animal, without being born in any other state in between, remain as lower animals for an infinite period. The magnitude of that infinite period is described here from the perspective of space and time. From the perspective of time, countless utsapinis and pravaspinis pass, yet the lower animal remains as a lower animal. This magnitude of that infinite period should be understood as countless pudgalaparaavartan. One should understand that there are as many countless pudgalaparaavartan as there are moments in the countless parts of the aavlika. This state of existence of the lower animal is in comparison to the state of existence of the plant (vanaspatikayik), not in comparison to other lower animals, because the state of existence of other lower animals, except for the plant, is not that long. The state of existence of a female lower animal (tiryanchyoanik stri) - its state of existence is from the lowest antarmuhurta to the highest three palyopama plus a crore purva, because the state of existence of sentient five-sense lower animals (sanjnee panchendriya tiryanch) and humans is at most eight bhava. Those beings who have a lifespan of countless years are born in the heaven (devalok) after death, not in the state of being a lower animal. Therefore, one should understand that they have a lifespan of seven bhava crore purva, and the fifth and final bhava is in the heaven of Devakuru, etc. In this way, one should understand three palyopama plus a crore purva. The state of existence of gods and goddesses (dev devion ko kayasthiti) - the state of existence of gods and goddesses should be understood according to their state of existence (bhavasthiti). The highest state of existence of goddesses is fifty-five palyopama, this is said in comparison to the Aishana goddesses, not in comparison to other goddesses. The state of existence of a liberated being (siddhjeeva) - a liberated being is infinite (saadi-ananta). The liberated state (siddhparaya) has a beginning, but no end. The liberated state is imperishable (akshaya). The passions (ragaadi dosha) are the cause of birth and death, which are not present in a liberated being, because they have completely destroyed the karmas that are the cause of attachment and aversion (ragaadvesha). The state of existence of hell beings, etc. (aparayaapt narak praadi ko kayasthiti) - a hell being, etc. remains in the lowest and highest antarmuhurta in the state of being an incomplete hell being (aparayaapt narak roop), because the incomplete state (aparayaapt avastha) does not last longer than an antarmuhurta. After the antarmuhurta, the complete state (paryaapt avastha) begins. The state of existence of a complete hell being, etc. (paryaapt narak praadi ko kayasthiti) - the complete state of existence of hell beings, etc. is the state of existence of the complete state, minus one antarmuhurta of the incomplete state. The state of existence of the complete state is also the state of existence of the complete hell being.

From the least Antomuhurta to the most excellent one hundred distinct Sagaropama (it remains in the Panchendriya-paryaptak-paryaya). Third door  //  3  //  Discussion-The third Indriyadwar-In the present 14 sutras (from sutra 1271 to 1284), the state of the sentient, non-sentient and sufficient-insufficient beings in that Paryaya has been described. Sentient-non-sentient-sentient being is called sentient and the being without Dravyendriya-Bhaavendriya (Siddh) is called non-sentient. The state of the sentient being in the sentient Paryaya-Sentient beings have been said to be of two types-Anadi-ananta and Anadi-santa  /  The one who is sentient, is regularly a worldly being and the world is Anadi  /  The one who will become Siddh, is Anadi-santa. Because in the state of liberation, the absence of the sentient Paryaya will occur  /  The one who will never become Siddh, is Anadi-ananta. Because the end of his sentient Paryaya will also not occur. Non-sentient-sufficient-insufficient are devoid of special characteristics  /  Sentient beings are of both sufficient and insufficient types  /  Those who are insufficient, should be understood in terms of attainment and instrument. In both ways, their Paryaya is from the least to the most excellent Antarmuhurta measure and sufficient should be understood here in terms of attainment. It is also possible in the Vigrahagati, even if it is insufficient from the instrument  /  Therefore, it becomes Siddh in the most excellent one hundred Sagaropama distinctness, that is, in a time slightly more than two hundred to nine hundred Sagaropama  /  Otherwise, the time of Karanaparyaptak is at most Antarmuhurta less than thirty-three Sagaropama measure  /  Therefore, the aforementioned statement will not be consistent. Therefore, here and further, sufficiency should be understood only in terms of attainment. 'The measure of Vanaspatikala-In terms of time, infinite Utsarpini and infinite Avasarpini time; in terms of area, infinite loka, innumerable Pudgalparavarta and those Pudgalparavarta should be understood as the innumerable part of Avali. That is, in the innumerable part of Pravali, as many times as there are, so many Pudgalparavarta should be understood here. The meaning of Sankhyatakala-The state of Dvi-indriya has been told as Sankhyatakala, its meaning is Sankhyat year, that is, the time of Sankhyat thousand years  /  The time of Panchendriya-For some more thousand Sagaropama, the Panchendriya being remains continuously Panchendriya  /  This time is due to roaming in these four-Naraka, Tiryanch, Manushya and Devagati  /  1.

[334] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra] The state of a one-sense-endowed sufficient being - A one-sense-endowed sufficient being remains in the one-sense-endowed sufficient state for a thousand years. The reason for this is that the excellent state of existence of an earth-bodied being is 22,000 years, that of a water-bodied being is 7,000 years, that of an air-bodied being is 3,000 years, and that of a plant-bodied being is 10,000 years. All these together amount to a thousand years in number. / The state of existence of a two-sense-endowed sufficient being - A two-sense-endowed sufficient being remains in the two-sense-endowed sufficient state for a number of years. / The duration of the state of existence of a two-sense-endowed being is twelve years, but it is not possible for all existences to be in the excellent state. Therefore, even if we combine a number of sufficient existences, it can only amount to a number of years, not hundreds or thousands of years. The state of existence of a three-sense-endowed sufficient being - A three-sense-endowed sufficient being remains in this state for a number of nights and days. The state of existence of a three-sense-endowed being is 46 days. Therefore, even if it undergoes a number of existences, all together they amount to a number of nights and days. The state of existence of a four-sense-endowed sufficient being - A four-sense-endowed sufficient being remains in the four-sense-endowed sufficient state for a number of months, because the excellent state of existence of a four-sense-endowed being is 6 months. Therefore, even if it undergoes a number of existences, they amount to a number of months. ' The fourth gate of the body 1285. Can a being remain in the state of a body, O Venerable One? Can it remain, how long? Gautama! It has been said that a being can remain in the state of a body in two ways. They are as follows - (1) without beginning and without end, and (2) without beginning and with an end. / 1286. How long does an earth-bodied being remain in the state of an earth-bodied being, O Venerable One? Gautama! (It remains) for the shortest period of time, an antarmūhurta, and for the longest period of time, an asamkhyeya kalpa; (that is) in terms of time, for an asamkhyeya utsarpini-avani (it remains in the state of an earth-bodied being). In terms of space, for an asamkhyeya loka. / 1287. And so it is for the water-bodied, air-bodied, and plant-bodied beings. / 1. Prajñāpanā Sūtra Malay. Commentary, page 378

## Eighteenth Kayasthitipada [341]

**Discussion:** The fourth Kayadwar presents thirty-six sutras (from 1285 to 1320) which describe the Kayasthiti (the continuous duration of a form) in relation to the various synonyms of Shatkay.

**Explanation of Sakayik:** A Sakayik is one who has a Kay. Although there are five types of Kay - Audarik, Vaikriya, Aharak, Tejas and Karman; here, only Tejas and Karman Kay should be understood, because these two remain throughout the cycle of existence. Otherwise, in the state of Vigraha-Gati (movement of the body), there are no other bodies except Tejas and Karman of the living being who is present and has attained a body. In such a situation, the living being would become Akayik (without a body) and the two distinctions mentioned in the original sutras - Sansari (worldly) and Sansaraparagami (transcendent) - would not be formed.

The original sutras mention two types of Sakayik - Anadi-Aperyavasit (beginningless and endless) and Anadi-Sapyavasit (beginningless and ending). The one who is not Sansaraparagami is Abhavy (unworthy) Anadi-Anant-Sakayik, because the cessation of his Kay is never possible. The one who is Moksha-gami (liberated) is Anadi-Sant (beginningless and ending), because he becomes completely devoid of all bodies in the state of liberation.

Thus, from the perspective of Shatkay, there are six types: Prithvikaayik (earth-bodied), Apkaayik (water-bodied), Tejaskaayik (fire-bodied), Vayukaayik (air-bodied), Vanaspatikaayik (plant-bodied) and Sakayik.

**Explanation of Asankhyatkal:** One should understand Asankhyatkal as the countless Utsarpini (ascending) and Avasarpini (descending) periods of time. One should understand Asankhyat Kshetra (region) as the countless Lokas (worlds). The meaning is that there are countless regions in the Lokakasha (space of the worlds). If one were to remove one region at a time from all the countless Lokakashas, then the number of Utsarpini and Avasarpini periods that would pass in that removal should be understood here.

In summary, the subtle living being remains continuously in the subtle form for a maximum of this much time. This description should be understood in relation to the Savyavaharik Jivarashi (the group of living beings that are perceptible). In the case of the Avyavaharik Jivarashi (the group of living beings that are imperceptible), the statement of Asankhyatkal is not consistent due to the Anaditya (beginninglessness) of the subtle Nigodaya living being.

**Explanation of the Asankhyatava part of an Angul (finger) in relation to Kshetra:** The meaning is that if one were to remove one region at a time from the countless regions that exist in the Asankhyatava part of an Angul, then the number of Utsarpini and Avasarpini periods that would pass in that removal should be understood here.

The question arises: How can countless Utsarpini and Avasarpini periods pass in the removal of the atoms of such a small region as the Asankhyatava part of an Angul? The solution is that this is possible because the Kshetra is much more subtle than time. It is also said: Time is subtle, but Kshetra is even more subtle.

This statement is in relation to the Badar Vanaspatikaay (the plant-bodied living being that is like a cloud), because it is not possible for any other Badar to remain in that state for such a long time.

**[343 Sayogi]**

A being who will attain liberation in the future is Anadi-Sant Sayogi. He is a Bhavy being.

**[Manoyogi]**

A Manoyogi being in the Manoyogi Paryaya remains continuously in the Manoyogi Paryaya for a minimum of one time period and a maximum of Antarmuhurt. When a being, through Audarikakayayoga, receives Manoyogya Pudgals in the first time period, transforms them into the form of mind in the second time period, and abandons them in the third time period, or attains death, then he remains a Manoyogi for one time period. He remains a Manoyogi for a maximum of Antarmuhurt. When a being continuously receives and abandons Manoyogya Pudgals, he does so only until Antarmuhurt. After that, the being naturally ceases from it. Subsequently, he again receives and abandons Manoyogya Pudgals, but due to the subtlety of time, he may not be aware of the interruption in between. This means that the process of receiving and abandoning Manoyogya Pudgals continues uninterruptedly until Antarmuhurt. After that, there is definitely an interruption, because that is the nature of the being. Therefore, the maximum duration of Manoyoga is stated here as Antarmuhurt.

**[Vachanayogi]**

The Kalasthiti of a Vachanayogi is similar to that of a Manoyogi. He also remains for a minimum of one time period and a maximum of Antarmuhurt. A being, through Kayayoga, receives Bhashayogya substances in the first time period, transforms them into the form of speech in the second time period, and abandons them in the third time period, or attains death. Thus, a Vachanayogi takes one time period. Its maximum duration is Antarmuhurt, because until Antarmuhurt, he definitely ceases from receiving and abandoning Bhashayogya Pudgals. This is the nature of the being.

**[Kayayogi]**

A Kayayogi remains continuously as a Kayayogi for a minimum of Antarmuhurt and a maximum of Vanaspatikala. Vachanayoga is also found in Dwindriyadi beings. When Vachanayoga or Manoyoga also occurs, Kayayoga does not have dominance. Therefore, due to being Sadisanta, he remains in Kayayoga for a minimum of Antarmuhurt. He remains in Kayayoga for a maximum of Vanaspatikala. The duration of Vanaspatikala has been explained earlier. Only Kayayoga is found in Vanaspatikayik beings, Vachanayoga and Manoyoga do not occur. Due to the absence of other Yogas, they remain continuously in Kayayoga until they attain Trasaparyaya.

**[Sixth Ved Dwar 1326]**

"Bante! What is Saveda?"

"Go Yama! Saveda is defined in three ways:

1. Pranadiya or Aprajjavaasi
2. Agadiya or Saprajjavaasi
3. Sadiya or Saprajjavaasi

Of these, those who are Sadiya or Saprajjavaasi are those who..."

[Eighteenth Kalasthitipada] [345 [1326 U.] Gautama! From the lowest one moment to the highest plant-period, he continuously remains in the form of a neuter-vedaka. / 1330. Avedaka, O Venerable One! Avedaka, in what form? Gotama! Avedaka has been declared in two ways. / It is like this - (1) Sadi-ananta and (2) Sadi-santa. / Of these, the one who is Sadi-santa, remains in the form of an avedaka from the lowest one moment to the highest antarmukha (continuously). Sixth Door // 5 // Discussion - Sixth Ved-door - In the present five sutras (from 1326 to 1330), the time-position of the svedaka, avedaka, and the male-female neuter-vedaka has been described. Three types of svedaka - (1) Anadi-aparyavasita - The being who will never attain the upshama-shreni or kshapaka-shreni, is called anadi-aparyavasita (infinite), the rise of his ved will never cease. / (2) Anadi-saparyavasita - Whose beginning is not there, but the end is there. The being who will attain the upshama-shreni or kshapaka-shreni sometime, but who has not attained it yet, is the anadi-saparyavasita svedaka. The rise of the ved of such a being ceases when he attains the upshama-shreni or kshapaka-shreni. Adi-saparyavasita - The being who attains the upshama-shreni and becomes vedatita, but falls from the upshama-shreni and again attains the sved-state, is called the sadi-saparyavasita svedaka. ' Sadi-saparyavasita svedaka's time-position - The time-measure of such a svedaka remains continuously connected with the svedaka-paryay from the lowest antarmukha to the highest infinite time (time-measure mentioned in the original text). The meaning is that when a being, having ascended to the upshama-shreni, becomes avedaka by subduing the three vedas, but falls from the upshama-shreni and again attains the svedaka state, and then again quickly attains the upshama-shreni, or according to the opinion of the karmagranthikas, the kshapaka-shreni, and then subdues or destroys the three vedas in an antarmukha, then that being remains in the sved-state only for an antarmukha. Excellently, the being remains sved until deshon ardha-pudgala-paravarta. Because, having fallen from the upshama-shreni, that being wanders in the world only for that much time. Therefore, the above-mentioned excellent time-measure of the sadi-santa svedaka being is proved. / Explanation of the time-position from the five expectations of the stri-vedaka - The lowest time-measure of the stri-vedaka is one moment, it is like this - A being, having subdued the three vedas in the upshama-shreni, becomes avedaka. 1.

Having attained the *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* (a Jain scripture), one may fall down and experience the female *veda* for a time, and then, after a period, be reborn as a deity in the heavens. There, that being is a male *vedī*, not a female *vedī*. Thus, the inferior time of the female *vedī* is proven to be only one time. (1) According to the first *prādeśa* (division), the explanation of the time measure of one hundred and ten *palya* units, which is greater than the *koṭi* of births, is as follows: A being, after experiencing five or six births in the *koṭi* of births of women or animals, is born as a deity in the *Īśāna* kalpa, in the form of a deity, with a lifespan of fifty-five *palya* units, in the state of an *apari-gṛhīta* (non-married) deity. When its lifespan is exhausted, it falls from there and is reborn as a woman or an animal, in the form of a woman, with a lifespan of a *koṭi* of births. After that, it is born again as a deity in the *Īśāna* kalpa, in the form of a deity, with a lifespan of fifty-five *palya* units, in the state of a *pari-gṛhīta* (married) deity. After that, it inevitably attains the second *veda*. Thus, it is proven that the female *vedī* continuously exists for one hundred and ten *palya* units, which is greater than the *koṭi* of births, along with the *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* *paryāya* (cycle). (2) According to the second *prādeśa*, the explanation of eighteen *palya* units, which is greater than the *koṭi* of births, is as follows: A being, as before, after experiencing five or six births in the *koṭi* of births of women or animals, is born twice in the *Īśāna* heaven, in the form of a deity, with a lifespan of fifty-five *palya* units, in the state of a *pari-gṛhīta* deity, not an *apari-gṛhīta* deity. In such a situation, the superior time-state of the female *vedī* is proven to be continuously eighteen *palya* units, which is greater than the *koṭi* of births. (3) According to the third *prādeśa*, the explanation of the time measure of fourteen *palya* units, which is greater than the *koṭi* of births, is as follows: A being is born twice in the *Saudharmā* heaven, in the form of a deity, with a lifespan of seven *palya* units, in the state of a *pari-gṛhīta* deity. Thus, with fourteen *palya* units from the two births as deities, and the *koṭi* of births, which is greater than the *koṭi* of births, of women or animals, the existence of the female *vedī* is proven, and the continuous time-state of the female *vedī* is proven to be fourteen *palya* units, which is greater than the *koṭi* of births. (4) According to the fourth *prādeśa*, the explanation of the time measure of one hundred *palya* units, which is greater than the *koṭi* of births, is as follows: A being is born twice in the *Saudharmā* heaven, in the form of a deity, with a lifespan of fifty *palya* units, in the state of an *apari-gṛhīta* deity, as mentioned before. Then, the superior time-state of the female *vedī* is proven to be continuously one hundred *palya* units, which is greater than the *koṭi* of births. (5) According to the fifth *prādeśa*, the explanation of the time measure of *palya* units, which is greater than the *koṭi* of births, is as follows: While wandering through various births, any being can continuously remain a female *vedī* for a maximum of *palya* units, which is greater than the *koṭi* of births, but no more. Because, after experiencing seven births in the *koṭi* of births of women or animals, a being is born in the form of a woman in the *Deva-kuru* and other realms, with a lifespan of three *palya* units. After that, it is reborn as a deity in the *Saudharmā* heaven, in the form of a deity, with an inferior lifespan. Then, that being inevitably attains the second *veda*. From this perspective, the superior time-state of the female *vedī* is proven to be continuously *palya* units, which is greater than the *koṭi* of births. 1. *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* *Malayā* *Vṛtti*, folio 384-385.

## Eighteenth Kamyasthitipad [347]

**The state of the Avedak Jiva:** There are two types of Avedak Jivas - Sadi-A Paryavasit and Sadi-S Paryavasit. 

* A Jiva who attains the Kshapak श्रेणी and becomes Avedak is called Sadi-A Paryavasit Avedak, because such a Jiva can never become Savedak again. 
* A Jiva who attains the Upsham श्रेणी and becomes Avedak is called Sadi-S Paryavasit, because his Avedak state has a beginning and an end, which occurs when he falls to the ninth Gunasthan.

**Duration of Avedak state:** Among these, the Sadi-S Paryavasit Avedak remains Avedak for a minimum of one Samaya and a maximum of Antarmuhurt. This is because a Jiva who remains Avedak for one Samaya and then dies and takes birth in Devagati in the next Samaya, becomes Savedak due to the rise of Purushaved. Therefore, the minimum duration of Avedak state is called one Samaya. The maximum duration is called Antarmuhurt because after Antarmuhurt, if he falls from the श्रेणी, his Ved will arise.

**Duration of Napunsakavedi:** The maximum duration of Napunsakavedi is said to be Vanaspatikala, i.e., infinite time. This is because the Jivas in the plant kingdom are Napunsakavedi, and their lifespan is infinite.

## Seventh Kashayadwar 1331

**Question:** **Bhagavan!** How long does a Sakshayi Jiva remain in the Sakshayi state?

**Answer:** **Gautama!** There are three types of Sakshayi Jivas:

1. Anadi-A Paryavasit
2. Anadi-S Paryavasit
3. Sadi-S Paryavasit

The duration of the Sadi-S Paryavasit Savedak is mentioned in Sutra 1326, which states that it should be until the end of the Pudgalparavart in the field of Deshon.

Explanation of the three types of Sakṣayī - The jīva who is with kṣayās is called Sakṣayī. Kṣayā is a विकारी परिणाम of the jīva. Sakṣayī jīvas are of three types (1) Anādi-ananta - The jīva who will never attain the Upśamaśreṇī or Kṣapakaśreṇī is called Anādi-ananta Sakṣayī, because his kṣayās can never be destroyed. (2) Anādi-sānta - The jīva who will attain the Upśamaśreṇī or Kṣayakaśreṇī is called Anādi-sānta Sakṣayī, because the destruction of his kṣayā-udaya takes place in the eleventh Gaṇasthāna or the twelfth Guṇasthāna upon attaining the Upśama or Kṣayakaśreṇī. (3) Sādī-sānta - The jīva who attains the Upśamaśreṇī and becomes Akṣayī and then falls back from the Upśamaśreṇī and becomes Sakṣayī is called Sādī-sānta Sakṣayī. Because his kṣayā-udaya has a beginning and will also end in the future. Of these, the Sādī-sānta Sakṣayī remains continuously as Sakṣayī for a minimum of an antarmūhurta and a maximum of an infinite time. In this regard, the quantity of infinite time and its related reasoning should be understood like the Savēdī. Time period of Krodha-Māna-Māyā Kṣayī - The jīva who is with Krodha, Māna and Māyā kṣayās remains continuously as Krodhādikṣayī only for an antarmūhurta. Because the udaya (specific use) of any one kṣayā like Krodha etc. can remain for a minimum and a maximum of an antarmūhurta. The nature of the jīva is such that the udaya of Krodha etc. kṣayās does not remain for more than an antarmūhurta. 1. (a) Prajñāpanā Sūtra, Malaya. Vṛtti, Patrāṅka 386 (b) Prajñāpanā.

## Eighteenth Kayasthitipad [349]

**The Time Period of a Lobhakṣayī Jīva**

A Lobhakṣayī jīva remains as a Lobhakṣayī for a minimum of one time period and a maximum of an antarmūhurta. When a jīva who has attained the Upasama श्रेणी falls from it after becoming Upasāntarāga (in the eleventh guṇasthāna) and attains death in the first moment of the vedana of the lobha aṃśa, and is born in the Devaloka, and becomes a Krodhakṣayī, Mānakṣayī, and Māyakṣayī, then he is found to be a Lobhakṣayī for one time period.

**Question:** Why is it not stated that Krodha, etc., also remain for a minimum of one time period, according to the same principle that is given for Lobhakṣayī?

**Answer:** Although a jīva who falls from the Upasama श्रेणी attains death in the first moment of the vedana of Krodha, Māna, or Māyā, and is born in the Devaloka, yet by nature, the kṣayā with which the jīva has performed kāla remains for an antarmūhurta in the next bhava. This is known from the authority of the sūtra, which states that Krodha, Māna, and Māyā kṣayās remain for many time periods.

**The Time Period of an Akṣayī Jīva**

The sūtra regarding the time period of an Akṣayī jīva should be understood according to the principle of the Avedaka sūtra. An Akṣayī who has attained the Kṣapaka श्रेणी is sādi-ananta, because he does not fall from the Kṣapaka श्रेणी. However, an Akṣayī who has attained the Upasama श्रेणी is sādi-sānta. Therefore, he remains with the Akṣayā paryāya for a minimum of one time period. He becomes an Akṣayī for one time period, and then dies and is reborn in the Devaloka immediately (in the same time period), and becomes a Sakṣayī due to the arising of kṣayās. Therefore, the minimum time period of Akṣayitva is one time period. He remains an Akṣayī for a maximum of an antarmūhurta, after which he inevitably falls from the Upasama श्रेणी and becomes a Sakṣayī.

**The Time Period of a Selesya Jīva**

**Question:** How long does a Selesya jīva remain in the Selesya state?

**Answer:** There are two types of Selesya jīvas: (1) Anādi-aparyavasita and (2) Anādi-saparyavasita.

**The Time Period of a Kṛṣṇaleśya Jīva**

**Question:** How long does a Kṛṣṇaleśya jīva remain as a Kṛṣṇaleśya?

**Answer:** He remains as a Kṛṣṇaleśya for a minimum of an antarmūhurta and a maximum of thirty-three sāgaropam antarmūhurta.

[352] This should be understood in relation to the Brahma-loka kalpa. The gods of Brahma-loka have padmaleśyā and their highest state is ten sāgaropamas. Both the past and future antarmūhurta are included in the same antarmūhurta, which is why it is called antarmūhurta-adhika here. The highest time-antarmūhurta-adhika of the śuklaleśyāvan is said to be thirty-three sāgaropamas. This statement should be understood in relation to the gods of the Anuttaravimāna. Because they have śuklaleśyā and their highest state is thirty-three sāgaropamas. Antarmūhurta-adhika should be understood from the above mentioned reasoning. The time-state of the pra-leśyā beings - the a-leśyā beings are ayogi-kevali and siddha, they always remain beyond leśyā. Therefore, the a-leśyā state is called sādi-ananta.

Explanation of Samyagdristi-One whose vision is Samyak, true or non-contradictory, or one who has Samyak faith, perception and interest in the truth as propounded by the Jinas, is called Samyagdristi. / There are two types of Samyagdristi: Sadi-Anant-One who has attained Kshayik Samyaktva is Sadi-Anant Samyagdristi, because once it is born, Kshayik Samyaktva does not perish. From the perspective of Kshayopa-samik and Praupa-samik Samyaktva, Samyagdristi is Sadi-Sant, because both these Samyaktvas are not infinite, they are finite. Praupa-samik Samyaktva lasts for an Antarmuhurt and Kshayopa-samik Samyaktva lasts for sixty-six Sagaropama. From this perspective, it has been said that Sadi-Sant Myagdristi remains associated with Samyagdristiparaya for an Antarmuhurt, after which it attains Mithyatva. This statement is from the perspective of Aupa-samik Samyaktva. / The most superior remains Samyagdristi for a little more than sixty-six Sagaropama.

[354] For an infinite period of time, he remains a Mithyadrishti, and after an infinite period of time, he attains Samyaktva. For an infinite period of time, one should understand infinite Utsapini-Avapini, and in terms of space, one should understand the reflection of Pudgala everywhere in the entire field. Samyag-Mithyadrishti does not remain in the state of mixed vision for even a moment. After a moment, a being with mixed vision either becomes Samyagdristi or Mithyadrishti, therefore, one should understand that the minimum and maximum time for Samyag-Mithyadrishti is only a moment.

##  356] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra Two Types of Knowers (1) Sādi-A-paryavasita - A being who, after the arising of right knowledge, always remains in it, is a Ksāyika Samyagdṛṣṭi Knower or a Kevala-jñānī Sādi-A-paryavasita Knower. (2) Sādi-S-paryavasita - A being whose right knowledge is liable to be lost in the absence of right vision, is a Sādi-S-paryavasita Knower. Except for Kevala-jñāna, other types of knowledge are considered Sādi-S-paryavasita because they are of fixed duration, not eternal. Of these two, the Sādi-Sānta Knower state lasts for a short period, an antarmūhūrta, after which the knowledge-result is destroyed by the arising of falsehood. The superior duration, which is said to be slightly more than 66 sāgaropamas, should be understood in the same way as Samyagdṛṣṭi, because only Samyagdṛṣṭi is a Knower.

The Duration of the Avadhi-jñānī - The inferior duration of the Avadhi-jñānī is one time period, not an antarmūhūrta, because when a Tiryac-pañcendriya, human, or deva attains rightness, their Vibhangajñāna transforms into Avadhi-jñāna as soon as they attain rightness. However, due to the deva's chyavana, or the death of other beings, or other reasons, their Avadhi-jñāna is lost only after a long time, so its duration is one time period. Its superior duration is 66 sāgaropamas. It is as follows: A being who has attained Apratipāti Avadhi-jñāna goes to the Vijayā etc. vimānas twice, or is born in the Acyuta-devaloka three times, then their duration is sixty-six sāgaropamas.

The Duration of the Manaḥ-paryavajñānī - The Manaḥ-paryavajñānī remains in the Manaḥ-paryavajñānī state for a short period, one time period. When a restrained being, while in the apramatta state, attains Manaḥ-paryavajñāna and dies in the same apramatta-samyata state, then they remain as a Manaḥ-paryavajñānī for one time period. The reason for the superior duration being up to Deśona-pūrva-koṭi is that there is no greater restraint than this, and without restraint, Manaḥ-paryavajñāna cannot remain.

Three Types of Knowers, Mṛtyajñānī and Śrutājñānī - (1) Anādi-Ananta - A being who has never attained right knowledge and will never attain it in the future is an Anādi-Ananta ignorant being. (2) Anādi-Sānta - A being who has never attained knowledge but will attain it sometime in the future is an Anādi-Sānta ignorant being. (3) Sādi-Sānta - A being who has attained right knowledge and then became ignorant again due to the arising of falsehood, but will attain knowledge again in the future, is a Sādi-Sānta ignorant being. The Sādi-Sānta ignorant being continuously remains in the ignorant state for a short period, an antarmūhūrta, after which they attain rightness and become a Knower, their ignorant state is destroyed. They remain ignorant for an infinite period, the reason for which has been stated before. After this period (infinite Utsarpiṇī-Avasarpiṇī period), the being inevitably attains rightness and their ignorance-result is removed.

The Duration of the Vibhangajñānī - Its inferior duration is one time period, its superior duration is Deśona-pūrva-koṭi or more.  - - - - - 1. Prajñāpanā. Malaya. Vṛtti, Patrāṅka 389 2. Ibid., Malaya. Vṛtti, Patrāṅka 389 3. Ibid., Malaya. Vṛtti, Patrāṅka 389-390

## The Eighteenth Kayasthitipad

A being who is a Vibhangajnani remains in that state from the 357th to the 33rd Sagaropama. When a Panchendriya Tiryanch, a human, or a deva, having attained Samyagdristi, becomes an Avadhijnani and then attains Mithyatva, at the time of attaining Mithyatva, due to the influence of Mithyatva, his Avadhijnana transforms into Vibhangajnana. Thus, after attaining Mithyatva, when that Vibhangajnani deva, human, or Panchendriya Tiryanch dies, the state of Vibhangajnana lasts for a certain period of time. When a Mithyadristi Panchendriya Tiryanch or human, after spending a few years of a life of crores of years, attains Vibhangajnana and is born in the seventh Narakabhoomi, among the Narakas who are in the state of 33 Sagaropama, the duration of the Vibhangajnani's state is 33 Sagaropama plus one koti years. After that, the being either attains Samyaktva and becomes an Avadhijnani, or his Vibhangajnana is destroyed.

Pranagaro-vutte vi evam cheva / Daram 13 // [1363] A being with Anakara-upayoga also remains in the Anakara-upayoga state for a minimum and maximum of an Antarmukhurta / Thirteenth Door / / 13 / /  Discussion - In the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth Darshan, the ten Sutras presented by the restrained and the Upayoga doors (Sutras 1354 to 1363) discuss the duration of the state of beings like Chakshusdarshani, restrained, unrestrained, restrained-restrained, unrestrained-unrestrained, unrestrained-restrained, Sakara-upayoga, and Anakara-upayoga in their respective categories. The duration of the state of Chakshusdarshani - Chakshusdarshani remains in the Chakshusdarshani state for a minimum of an Antarmukhurta and a maximum of a little more than a thousand Sagaropama. When a Tri-indriya being is born in a Chatur-indriya or higher state and remains in that state for an Antarmukhurta and then is reborn in a Tri-indriya or lower state, it remains in the Chakshusdarshani state for an Antarmukhurta. / The maximum of a little more than a thousand Sagaropama should be understood as the time spent in wandering through the Chatur-indriya, Pancha-indriya, Tiryancha, and Naraka realms. Two types of Chakshusdarshani - 1. Anadi-ananta - a being who will never attain Siddhi. 2. Anadi-santa - a being who may attain Siddhi. The duration of the state of Avadhi-darshani is a minimum of one Samaya and a maximum of a little more than sixty-six Sagaropama. It is as follows - the twelfth Devaloka is twenty-two Sagaropama in size. If a being goes there with Vibhangajnan and returns with Avadhijnan, then twenty-two Sagaropama is the time for Vibhangajnan and twenty-two Sagaropama is the time for Avadhijnan. Similarly, if a being goes there with Vibhangajnan three times and returns with Avadhijnan, then sixty-six Sagaropama is the time for Vibhangajnan and sixty-six Sagaropama is the time for Avadhijnan. The time spent in the intervening human realms should be understood as a little more. / Thus, the total time is a little more than sixty-six Sagaropama.

**360]** **The Three Types of Restrained Beings:** 

1. **Anadi-Praparva-sita:** A being who has never attained restraint and will never attain it.
2. **Anadi-Saparyavasita:** A being who has never attained restraint but will attain it in the future.
3. **Sadi-Saparyavasita:** A being who has attained restraint but has fallen from it, but will attain it again.

**Sadi-Santa Asanyata:** A being who is unrestrained, the lowest for a short period and the highest for an infinite period, remains bound by the cycle of unrestraint. After an infinite period (Aparadha Pudgala Paravarta), they inevitably attain restraint.

**Duration of Restrained, Unrestrained, and Restrained-Unrestrained:** The duration of the state of Deshaviriti is used as the lowest limit of time (Antamuhurta). Therefore, the lowest time limit is considered to be Antamuhurta. There are many breaks in Deshaviriti, such as two Karana, three Yoga, etc. Therefore, it takes Antamuhurta to accept it. In Sarvaviriti, the vow of accepting the renunciation of all attachments can be done in a single moment. Therefore, the lowest time limit for a restrained being is said to be one moment.

**No-Restrained, No-Restrained-Unrestrained, No-Restrained-Restrained:** A being who is neither restrained, nor unrestrained, nor restrained-unrestrained, is a Siddha, and the Siddha state is Sadi-Ananta (eternal).

**Duration of the State of Those with Form-Use and Formless-Use:** The lowest and highest duration is Antarmuhurta. The duration of the state of the Chhadmastha beings, whether they have form-use or formless-use, is Antarmuhurta. The simultaneous use of the state of Kevalis is not intended here.

**Fourteenth Door of Food - 1364.** **"Bhagavan! How long does the Aharaka Jiva remain in the form of Aharaka?"** **"Gautama! The Aharaka Jiva is said to be of two types: Chhadmastha-Aharaka and Kevala-Aharaka."**

**1365.** **"Bhagavan! How long does the Chhadmastha-Aharaka remain in the form of Chhadmastha-Aharaka?"** **"For as long as the taking of the Kshudragabha is difficult, for an immeasurable period of time, for an immeasurable number of Ussappini-Prosappini periods, for a part of an Angula (finger) from the field."**

[Eighteenth Kasthitipad] This is not about the five times, because the disintegration movement is not intended here. Therefore, when there is a disintegration movement of three times, then the living being remains without food for the first two times. Therefore, in the description of food-taking, the mention of the taking of subtle food less than those two times has been made. It remains food-taking for an excellent innumerable time, after that, the disintegration movement takes place according to the rule and in the disintegration movement, there is a period of being without food. / For this reason, infinite time is not mentioned here. ' The time limit of the pseudo-non-food-taking is from one time to two times at the most, the pseudo-non-food-taking living being remains in the pseudo-non-food-taking period. Here, two times are mentioned, which are more excellent than the disintegration movement of three times. The disintegration movement of four and five times is not intended here. The time limit of the state of the non-food-taking Kevali who is associated with the subtle food (is) that he remains in the non-food-taking period for three times, which is neither the least nor the most excellent.

## The Eighteenth Kayasthilip 1378.

**Question 1378:**  Gautama, how long does a *samsara-parita* (bound) being remain in the *samsara-parita-paryaya* (state of bondage)?

**Answer 1378:**  Gautama, the least amount of time is an *anto-muhurta* (a very short period of time), and the greatest amount of time is *ananta-kala* (infinite time), until the *desona-apardha-pudgala-paravarta* (the half-cycle of the transformation of matter).

**Question 1376:**  Gautama, how long does an *aparita* (unbound) being remain in the *aparita-paryaya* (state of liberation)?

**Answer 1376:**  Gautama, there are two types of *aparita* beings: (1) *kaya-aparita* (liberated in body) and (2) *samsara-aparita* (liberated from the cycle of birth and death).

**Question 1380:**  Gautama, how long does a *kaya-aparita* being remain in the *kaya-aparita-paryaya* (state of liberation in body)?

**Answer 1380:**  Gautama, the least amount of time is an *anto-muhurta* (a very short period of time), and the greatest amount of time is *vanaspati-kala* (the lifespan of a tree).

**Question 1381:**  Gautama, how long does a *samsara-aparita* being remain in the *samsara-aparita-paryaya* (state of liberation from the cycle of birth and death)?

**Answer 1381:**  Gautama, there are two types of *samsara-aparita* beings: (1) *anadi-aparyavasita* (without beginning and without end) and (2) *anadi-saparyavasita* (without beginning but with an end).

**Question 1382:**  Gautama, how long does a *noparita-noaparita* (neither bound nor unbound) being remain in the *noparita-noaparita-paryaya* (state of neither bondage nor liberation)?

**Answer 1382:**  Gautama, it is *sadi-aparyavasita* (without beginning and without end). This is the sixteenth *dwar* (gate).

**Commentary:**  The seven sutras (1376 to 1382) presented in the sixteenth *parita-dwar* (gate of bondage) describe the duration of the *sv-sv-paryaya* (respective states) of the two types of *parita* (bound) beings, the two types of *aparita* (unbound) beings, and the *noparita-noaparita* (neither bound nor unbound) beings.

---------------------------
## The duration of the state of being a "Kayapari" (body-bound)

The **Kayapari** state is the state of being embodied in every living being. This state can last from a minimum of **Antarmuhurt** (a very short time) to a maximum of **Asankhyatkal** (an immeasurable period of time). 

If a being is born into a **Nigod** (a state of being without a body) and then emerges into a body, it lives for a short time, **Antarmuhurt**, before returning to the **Nigod**. In this case, the minimum duration of the **Kayapari** state is **Antarmuhurt**.

On the other hand, a being can remain in the **Kayapari** state for an **Asankhyatkal**, which is equivalent to the lifespan of the **Prithvikai** (Earth). This **Asankhyatkal** is the same as the time taken for countless **Utsarpini** (ascending) and **Avapini** (descending) cycles of the universe. In terms of space, this **Asankhyatkal** is equivalent to the size of countless **Lokas** (worlds).

## The duration of the state of being a "Sansarapari" (world-bound)

A **Sansarapari** is a being who has attained **Samyaktva** (right faith, knowledge, and conduct) and has thus limited their cycle of births and deaths.  A **Sansarapari** will eventually attain **Moksha** (liberation) after an **Anantkal** (infinite time).

## The duration of the state of being a "Kay-Apari" (body-free) and "Sansar-Apari" (world-free)

A **Kay-Apari** is a being who is **Anantkayik** (infinitely embodied) and has not attained **Samyaktva**. A **Sansar-Apari** is a being who has attained **Samyaktva** but has not limited their cycle of births and deaths.

The **Kay-Apari** state can last from a minimum of **Antarmuhurt** to a maximum of **Vanaspatikala** (an infinite period of time). When a being is born into a **Nigod** after being liberated from a body and then returns to a body, the minimum duration of the **Kay-Apari** state is **Antarmuhurt**. The maximum duration is **Vanaspatikala**, which is equivalent to an infinite period of time. After this, the being will eventually be liberated from the cycle of births and deaths.

## The two types of "Sansarapari"

There are two types of **Sansarapari**:

1. **Anadi-Sant**: A being whose cycle of births and deaths will eventually end.
2. **Anadi-Anant**: A being whose cycle of births and deaths will never end.

## The state of being a "No-Pari" (neither body-bound nor world-bound)

A **No-Pari** is a being who has attained **Siddhatva** (perfection). This state is **Sadi-Anant** (infinitely lasting).

## The duration of the "Paryapt" (sufficient) state

A **Paryapt** being is a being who has attained **Samyaktva** and has limited their cycle of births and deaths. The minimum duration of the **Paryapt** state is **Antarmuhurt**, and the maximum duration is **Shatsagaropamapruthaktva** (a period of time equivalent to countless oceans).

## The duration of the "A-Paryapt" (insufficient) state

An **A-Paryapt** being is a being who has not attained **Samyaktva**. The duration of the **A-Paryapt** state is **Antarmuhurt**.

This is the nineteenth 'Samyaktvapad' of the Prajnapana Sutra. * There are two paths, the path of liberation (Mokshamarg) and the path of worldly existence (Sansarmmarg), for the elevation and degradation of the soul. * When the soul attains right faith (Samyagdristi), it attains liberation by practicing the right path of liberation. As long as it remains in wrong faith (Mithyadristi), its tendency is towards the path of worldly existence. * All its religious actions, vows, austerities, rules, renunciation, and rejection are impure, its efforts are impure, and it only leads to worldly growth. It cannot attain liberation by destroying karma. With this intention, the scriptural authors discuss the three types of faith in this verse. * One who has an unopposed, right faith (Samyagdristi) in the Jina-proclaimed principles and all the elements, is called Samyagdristi. One who has even a slight doubt (Vipatti) in the Jina-proclaimed principles is called Mithyadristi. And one who has neither right faith nor doubt in those principles is called Samyagmithyadristi. Just as an ignorant person has neither interest nor disinterest in rice, etc., similarly, Samyagmithyadristi has neither interest nor disinterest in the Jina-proclaimed principles (elements). * This verse discusses right faith, wrong faith, and mixed faith in the general soul, the liberated soul, and the twenty-four categories of souls. * It states that only five-sensed beings can have mixed faith. Only one-sensed beings have wrong faith. * Liberated souls have only right faith. Souls from two-sensed to four-sensed do not have mixed faith. * The Shatkhandagama divides five-sensed beings into two categories: conscious and unconscious. It states that unconscious five-sensed beings are considered to have wrong faith. Right faith and wrong faith exist from two-sensed to five-sensed beings. * The Shatkhandagama states the reasons why a soul attains right faith and the mental state of a soul with right faith at the time of death. 00 (a) Nadasaniss Nanam - Uttara.

1400. "In the same way, all three types of vision are found in the Nairyik Jivas."

1401. "The same is true for the Asurakumaras, up to the Thanikumaras."

1401. "From the Asurakumaras up to the Thanikumaras (those who reside in the Bhavanas), they are also Samyagdristi, Mithyadristi, and Samyamithyadristi."

1402. "What about the Prithvikaiyikas?"

1402. "Gautama! The Prithvikaiyikas are not Samyagdristi, they are Mithyadristi, and not Samyamithyadristi."

1402. "In the same way, one should understand the nature of Samyaktvapraprapana in the Vanaspatikaiyikas (Apyakaikas, Tejaskaiyikas, Vayukaiyikas, and Vanaspatikaiyikas)."

1403. "What about the Beindiyas?"

1403. "Gautama! The Beindiyas are Samyagdristi, Mithyadristi, and not Samyamithyadristi."

**Vīsavaṁ: Antakriyāpada**

This is the twentieth *Antakriyāpada* of the *Prajñāpanā Sūtra*. This *pada* delves into profound considerations about *anta-kriyā* (the final act) from various perspectives and the specific achievements that result from it.

Every orthodox religion, philosophy, or school of thought in India believes in rebirth and liberation. They prescribe various practices, austerities, self-control, renunciation, rejection, vows, rules, etc., to attain a good next birth or complete liberation from birth and death. The birth of a being is as important as, if not more important than, the end of its life. This *Antakriyāpada* considers this very point so that every seeker can understand whose *anta-kriyā* is good and bad, and why.

*Anta-kriyā* means the action that ends *bhavam* (birth). This action leads to two outcomes: either a new *bhavam* (birth) is obtained, or the individual is completely liberated from birth and death by ending the *manushya-bhavam* (human existence). Therefore, the word *anta-kriyā* is used here in both senses: (1) liberation, (2) death - release from the body and other aspects of this *bhavam*.

This *Antakriyāpada* examines this *anta-kriyā* through ten doors in the twenty-four *daṇḍakavartī* beings: (1) *Antakriyādvāra*, (2) *Anantaradvāra*, (3) *Eka Samayadvāra*, (4) *Udvattādvāra*, (5) *Tīrthaṁkaradvāra*, (6) *Chakrīdvāra*, (7) *Baladēvadvāra*, (8) *Vāsudevadvāra*, (9) *Māṇḍalikadvāra*, and (10) *Ratnadvāra*. The conclusion of this *pada* explains which devotee or non-devotee is born into which deities after death. Finally, there is a discussion about the lifespan of *apamjñō* (beings with *akāmanirjarā* - absence of desires) and its brevity.

The first *Antakriyādvāra* examines which beings attain *anta-kriyā* (liberation) and which do not. Only humans are capable of this kind of *anta-kriyā*. A being has many different *paryāyas* (existences), including hellish ones. Therefore, a being residing in a hellish *paryāya* can attain human existence and then...

Page #964:
---------------------------
[376] The **Prajñāpanā Sūtra** states that one can attain **antarakriyā** (liberation) by acquiring **tathavidha yogyatā**, therefore it is said that a being in hell can be liberated, but not necessarily. In the second **ananta-dvāra**, the question is raised whether beings in hell and other lower realms experience **ananta-rāgata antarakriyā** or **paramparāgata antarakriyā**? In other words, does a being die in hell and immediately attain liberation in the human realm without any intervening births, or does it experience one or more births after hell before attaining liberation in the human realm? The answer is that a being from the first four hells can experience both **ananta-rāgata** and **paramparāgata antarakriyā**. However, a being from the last three hells can only experience **paramparāgata antarakriyā**, meaning it must experience one or more births after hell before attaining liberation in the human realm through **tathavidha sādhanā**. Beings from the **bhavanapati** and **pṛthvī-ap-vanaspatikāya** realms can experience both types of **antarakriyā**. Beings from the **tejas-kāyika**, **vāyu-kāyika**, and **vikale-indriya** realms can only experience **paramparāgata antarakriyā**. In the third **ekasamaya-dvāra**, the number of beings from hell and other lower realms who can experience **ananta-rāgata antarakriyā** in a single lifetime, both in the lowest and highest realms, is discussed. In the fourth **udavatta-dvāra**, it is explained where a being from the **nairāyika** and other twenty-four **daṇḍaka-varti** realms can be reborn after death, directly (without any intervening births) within the twenty-four **daṇḍakas**. Although the word **udvṛtta** is used here for death in all realms, in the **Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama**, the words **udvṛtta**, **kālagata**, and **cyuta** are used instead. Generally, in Jain scriptures, the word **cyuta** is used for the departure of **vaimānika** and **jyotiṣka** gods, **kālagata** for humans, and **udvṛtta** for beings in hell, **bhavanavāsī**, and **vāṇavyantara**. This **dvāra** also discusses what a being can attain after death in each realm, such as **dharma-śravaṇa**, **bodha**, **śraddhā**, **mati-śruta-jñāna**, **vrata-grahaṇa**, **avadhi-jñāna**, **anagāra-tva**, **manaḥ-paryāya-jñāna**, **kevala-jñāna**, and **antarakriyā** (**siddhi**). The fifth **tīrthaṅkara-dvāra** instructs whether a being from hell and other lower realms can be reborn directly in the human realm and attain the **tīrthaṅkara-pada**. It also explains what a being can attain in the course of its development if it cannot attain the **tīrthaṅkara-pada**, such as **antarakriyā**, **virati**, **viratā-virati**, **samyaktva**, **mokṣa**, **dharma-śravaṇa**, and **manaḥ-paryāya-jñāna**. The sixth to tenth **dvāras** discuss the **cakravarti-pada**, **baladeva-pada**, **vāsudeva-pada**, **māṇḍalika-pada**, and 1. **Prajñāpanā**. Malaya, Vṛtti, Patra 397 2.

## The Twenty-First Chapter of the Antakriya Pada [379 (10)]

This chapter, "Ratna Dvara," discusses the attainment of the Jewels of a Chakravarti, starting with the Jewel of the Commander-in-Chief.

**Antakriya:** The term "Antakriya" in this chapter has two meanings: (1) the action of ending (destroying) karmas or bhava (existence), and (2) the action of ending, meaning death. 

While in Jain Agamas, "Antakriya" is generally understood as the ending of all karmas (or bhava), the action of ending bhava leads to two outcomes: either liberation (moksha) or death (the release from the body). Therefore, the term "Antakriya" is used here in both these senses (moksha and death).

This chapter examines this "Antakriya" through the lens of the twenty-four Tirthankaras, using ten "Dwaras" (gates). Based on these ten "Dwaras," it can be said that the first three "Dwaras" discuss "Antakriya" as liberation (moksha), while the subsequent "Dwaras" are also related to "Antakriya," but there, "Antakriya" signifies death. 

However, it is also possible that "Antakriya" in these "Dwaras" signifies liberation, as these "Dwaras" also raise the question of whether or not liberation is possible for those who ascend to different yonis (species).

**First: Antakriya Dvara 1407.**

[1] "O Bhagavan! Does a jiva (living being) perform Antakriya?" [Answer] "Yes, Gautama! Some jivas perform Antakriya, and some do not." [1407-1]

[2] "Similarly, one should understand the relationship of Antakriya from the Nairyaika (hell) to the Vaimaniya (heavenly) realms." [1407-2]

The first part of this sutra discusses the Antakriya of the collective jivas, while the second part discusses the Antakriya of the twenty-four Tirthankaras from the Nairyaika to the Vaimaniya realms.

**The Mystery of Attaining or Not Attaining Antakriya:**

Those jivas who, due to the ripeness of their Bhavyatva (potential for liberation), attain human birth and other necessary materials, and through the power of those materials, experience the joy of their extremely powerful energy, ascend the ladder of क्षपकश्रेणी (kshapaka shreni), attain Kevalgyan (omniscience), and eliminate not only Ghatikarma (destructive karmas) but also Aghatikarma (non-destructive karmas), they are the ones who attain Antakriya.

Page #968:
---------------------------
[380] It also destroys the *Prajñāpanā Sūtra*, the same one that performs the final action, that is, it attains liberation by destroying all karmas. A being of the opposite type cannot attain the final action (liberation). According to this secret, one should understand the attainment and non-attainment of the final action by all beings. 1408. [1] "Sir, does a being in hell perform the final action?" "Gautama, this meaning (statement) is not possible." [1408-1] [2] "Sir, does a being in the realm of the Asura-Kumaras perform the final action?" "Gautama, this meaning is not possible." [1408-2] [3] "Similarly, one should understand the inability of a being in hell to perform the final action, up to and including the beings in the *vaimānika* realm. [Question] Specifically, does a being in hell perform the final action (by coming) among humans?" "Gautama, some beings in hell perform the final action, and some do not." [1408-3] 1409. "Similarly, one should understand the same for the Asura-Kumaras up to and including the *vaimānika* realm. In this way, there are 24 *daṇḍakas* (each) in 24 *daṇḍakas* (one should describe the final action in each of these). (All of these together make) 576 (questions and answers). - First Gate // 1 //" [1406] Discussion - The reason for the inability of a being in hell to perform the final action in hell and other realms - A being in hell cannot perform the final action while residing in the hellish realm because the destruction of all karmas (liberation) only occurs when right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, all three, attain perfection. In the hellish realm, perfect right faith may possibly occur in a being with a destructive right faith, but the ability for perfect right knowledge and the results of right conduct cannot arise in the hellish realm, because the nature of the hellish existence is such. 1. *Prajñāpanā*, *Malay*. *Vṛtti*, *Patra* 397

Page #969:
---------------------------
[Twentieth Interaction Chapter] [381] In the same way, a being in hell, from Asura Kumaras to Stanit Kumaras, in the Earth-bodied, one-sensed, multi-sensed, five-sensed Tiryanchas, in the Vaanavyantar, Jyotishka and Vaimanika Devas, cannot interact while residing there. The reason for this is the same, the nature of existence.  _ In humans, the beings of hell, etc., experience interaction in the human realm. Any being in hell, who has attained the complete material for humanhood, interacts by gradually destroying all karma, as mentioned earlier. And any being in hell, who has not attained the complete material, cannot interact. Similarly, any being from Asura Kumaras, etc. (from Asura Kumaras to Vaimanika Devas), who has attained the complete material, interacts, and any being who has not attained the complete material, cannot interact.  _ Every being in the twenty-four Dandakavarti realms, can interact in each of the twenty-four Dandakavarti realms, or not? In this way, there are a total of 244 x 24 = 576 question-answer options.  _ Second: Anantaradwar 1410. [1] "Geraiya nam bhanta! Ki anantaragata antakriya kareti, paramparagata antakriya kareti?" "Goayama! Anantaragata vi antakriya kareti, paramparagata vi antakriya kareti." [1410-1 Pra.] "O Venerable! Do beings in hell interact through Anantaragata (transmigration), or through Paramparagata (successive births)?" "Gautama! They interact through both Anantaragata and Paramparagata." [2] "Evam rayanppabhapuduvineraiya vi jav pankappabhapuduvineraiya." [1410-2 Pra.] "Similarly, one should understand the interaction of beings in hell from the Ratnapraba hell realm to the Pankaprabha hell realm." [3] "Dhumappabhapuduvineraiya nam bhanta! Puccha." "Goayama! No anantaragata antakriya kareti, paramparagata antakriya kareti." "Evam jav ahesattamapuduvineraiya." [1410-3 Pra.] "(Now) the question is - do beings in the Dhumaprabha hell realm interact through Anantaragata or Paramparagata?" 1. Prajnaapana: Malaya. Vritti, Patra 397 2. Same, Patra 397 3.

---------------------------
[382] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra [U.]]  He Gautama! (They) do not interact *ananatarāgata* (immediately), but they interact *paramparāgata* (traditionally). Similarly, one should know about the interaction of the *nairāyika* (hell beings) up to the seventh earth (the *tamāstāmābhūmi*). 1411. From *asurakumāra* (demon prince) to *thaṇiyakumāra* (breast-bearing prince) and the *pṛthvīkāyika*, *apkāyika*, and *vanaspatikāyika* (one-sensed beings of earth, water, and plants) interact both *ananatarāgata* and *paramparāgata*. 1412. *Teu-bāu-beindiya-teindiya-charidiya* (fire, air, two-sensed, three-sensed, and four-sensed beings) do not interact *ananatarāgata*, but they interact *paramparāgata*. 1413. The rest (all beings) interact both *ananatarāgata* and *paramparāgata*. - Second Gate // 2 // / Discussion - Interaction: *Ananatarāgata* or *Paramparāgata*? - Interaction (liberation) can only happen in the human realm, therefore the second gate asks about all beings from hell to the *vaimānika* (heavenly beings), whether the hell beings, etc., who interact, interact *ananatarāgata* (directly from hell, etc., to the human realm without interruption) or *paramparāgata* (after hell, etc., they take one or many births and then come to the human realm). This is the meaning of all these questions. The decision of *ananatarāgata* and *paramparāgata* interaction of beings - Hell beings interact in both ways. That is, they interact directly from hell to the human realm and also after leaving hell, they take births as *tiryanch* (animals), etc., and then come to the human realm. But specifically, the hell beings of the *ratnaprabhā*, *śarkarāprabhā*, *vālukāprabhā*, and *panka-prabhā* (jewel-light, sugar-light, sand-light, and mud-light) hell realms interact *ananatarāgata* and *paramparāgata*. But the hell beings of the remaining three (the *dhūma-prabhā*, *tamaḥ-prabhā*, and *tamāstāmāḥ-prabhā* (smoke-light, darkness-light, and deepest darkness-light) hell realms interact only *paramparāgata*. The reason for this should be understood from the above. From *grasarakumāra* (swallowing prince) to *stanitakumāra* (thunder prince), there are 10 types of *bhavanapati deva* (heavenly beings who rule over a realm) and *pṛthvīkāyika*, *apkāyika*, and *vanaspatikāyika*, these three types of one-sensed beings interact both *ananatarāgata* and *paramparāgata*. - - - 1.

[Twentieth Interaction] [389 1422. Non-existent, O Venerable! Does a being from hell, after being released from hell, get reborn directly into the realm of animals, celestial beings, or aerial beings? {Answer} Gautama! This is not possible. {Explanation} The discussion about the rebirth of beings from hell into hell, the realm of the guardians of the mansions, the realm of the disabled, the realm of the five-sensed animals, the realm of humans, the realm of animals, the realm of celestial beings, and the realm of aerial beings is presented in the first six sutras (sutras 1417 to 1422) of this chapter. Then, the discussion is about what kind of knowledge and virtues can beings born in the realm of the five-sensed animals and the realm of humans attain, such as: perfect knowledge of the Dharma, pure enlightenment, faith, understanding, interest, intellectual knowledge, virtuous conduct, vows, qualities, restraint, renunciation, taking of medicine and fasting, clairvoyance, knowledge of the mind, omniscience, and liberation.  Udvartan: In a specific sense, the word 'udvartan' in this scripture is used for 'death' that occurs in all realms, while in the 'Shatkhandagama', three words are used for death: 'udvartan' for those who die from the realms of hell, guardians of the mansions, animals, and celestial beings; 'kalagat' for those who die from the realms of animals and humans; and 'chyut' for those who die from the realm of aerial beings. The udvartan of beings from hell into the realm of the five-sensed animals and humans is clear from this text, as a being from hell cannot be reborn directly into hell, the realm of the guardians of the mansions, or the realm of the disabled. The reason for this is as stated above. A being from hell can be reborn directly into the realm of the five-sensed animals and humans. Some beings from hell who are reborn in the realm of the five-sensed animals and humans can attain perfect knowledge of the Dharma, perfect enlightenment, faith, understanding, interest, knowledge of the scriptures, virtuous conduct, vows, qualities, restraint, renunciation, taking of medicine and fasting, and clairvoyance. However, some beings from hell who are reborn in the realm of humans can go beyond this and attain non-attachment, knowledge of the mind, omniscience, and liberation.  Specific meanings of words:  - 'Kevalipannattam dhammam': Dharma as taught and explained by the omniscient.  - 'Labhenja savanayae': To attain by hearing.  - 'Kevalam bohin': Two meanings: (1) Attaining perfect and pure enlightenment (teaching of the Dharma), (2) Enlightenment taught by the omniscient directly or through tradition.  1.

##  Translation:

**[390] The meaning of the question in the Prajñapana Sutra - Does the listener of the Kevali-prajñapti-dharma truly understand the above-mentioned Kevalik Bodhi? Specific meanings of words like Sheel, etc. - Sheel-Brahmacharya, Vrat - rules related to various substances, qualities, feelings, etc., or Uttar-guna, Viraman - cessation from past gross Pranatipat, etc., rejection, abandonment of future gross Pranatipat, etc., Poshadhopavas - fasting in Ashtami, etc., which nourishes Dharma, Poshadhopavas /  Who has Avadhi-jnana? -  Tiryach-panchendriya and humans do not have Bhava-pratyaya Avadhi-jnana, they have Guna-pratyaya /  Those who possess qualities related to Sheel, etc., and have excellent results, their Avadhi-jnana-avaran karma is destroyed and they (Tiryach-panchendriya beings and humans) attain Avadhi-jnana, not everyone /  /  Who has Manah-paryaya-jnana? - Manah-paryaya-jnana is attained only by the An-agar, and that too by the one who is free from all distractions, and is endowed with various Siddhis. Therefore, Tiryach do not even attain An-agar-tva, then how can they attain Manah-paryaya-jnana and Keval-jnana! Among humans, only those who are An-agar, free from distractions, have pure character and are Siddhiman, attain Manah-paryaya-jnana. '**

**Munde Bhavita: Meaning - Mund is of two types - Dravya-mund and Bhava-mund /  By cutting hair, etc., Dravya-mund is attained, by abandoning all attachments, Bhava-mund is attained /  That is, by being mentally naked /  Sijjhajja Bujjhajja Muccejja: Relevant special meaning - Sijjhajja - completes all tasks, becomes successful, Bujjhajja - knows and sees the nature of all Lokaloka, Muccejja - becomes free from Bhavopahi Karmas /  Description of the origin of Asura-kumar, etc. - 1423.

In the above-mentioned beings, there is a difference in birth similar to that of the Narakas in the Tiryancha five-sensed beings and humans. The attainment of the Tiryancha five-sensed beings is generally similar to that of humans, but because humans have the potential for all qualities, they can attain Manahparyavgyan and Kevalgyan, and they can also attain Anugara.

There is no direct birth of the Nairyikas - Due to the nature of their existence, the Nairyikas do not die and are reborn directly into the Nairyikas, Bhavanapati, Vaanavyantara, Jyotishka, and Vaimanika Devas, because it is impossible for the Nairyikas to have a lifespan bound to the Nairyikabhava or Devabhava. / 2 / / The birth of the Prithvikaayikas - The Prithvikaayik beings are not born directly into the Narakas and Devas, because they cannot have a specific Manodravya, and therefore cannot have intense suffering and pure determination. / Humans can also interact when they are born. / 3 The birth of the Bhavanapati Devas - The 10 types of Bhavanapati Devas, including the Asurakumara, are born in the Earth, Air, and Plants. Their birth occurs up to the Ishana (second) Devaloka. When born in these Devas, they cannot hear the Kevaliprjnapt Dharma. All other things should be understood as being similar to the Nairyikas. The prohibition of the birth of the Tejaskaayika and Vaayukaayika in humans - These two cannot be born directly into humans, because their karma is complex, and it is impossible for them to be bound to the Manushagati, Manushayanoorvi, and Manushayau. They can be born in the Tiryancha five-sensed beings and obtain the Shravanaindriya, and thus obtain the Kevaliprjnapt Dharma, but due to their complex karma, they cannot attain the knowledge of the Kaivalikovodi (Dharma). The birth of the Vikaleindriya - The beings with two, three, and four senses, like the Prithvikaayikas, can be born in all places except the Devas and Narakas.

[Twentieth Interaction] [401 1452 Pr.] Bhagavan! Can a Tejaskaayik being, born in the human realm without any interval after emerging from the Tejaskaayik realm, attain Tirthankarhood? [U.] Gautama! This meaning is not valid, but he can attain the hearing of the Kevali-shaped Dharma. 1453. Similarly, one should understand the same in the case of Vaayukaayik beings. / [1453]  1454.

[1455 Pr.] The question is about the Dwiindriya, Triindriya, and Chaturindriya beings (whether they can attain Tirthankarhood directly after emerging from their respective realms?). [U.] Gautama!

Discussion - The attainment of the Tīrthankara position - In this fifth gate, the question is raised whether a being who dies in hell, etc., can be reborn directly as a human and attain the Tīrthankara position without any intermediate births. / It is also explained that if that being does not attain the Tīrthankara position, what can it attain in the course of its development?  
Summary - The conclusion of this entire section is that only a being who dies in hell or as a Vaimānika deva and is reborn directly as a human can attain the Tīrthankara position, not others. / The special meanings of the terms "Baddhāi", etc. - "Baddhāi" - like tying a heap of needles with a thread, the ordinary association of karmas (Tīrthankara name, gotra, etc.) with the soul is "Baddha". / "Puḍhāi" - like heating that heap of needles with fire and cutting it once with a hammer, the density that arises between them, similarly, the density that arises between the soul-regions and karmas is "Spṛṣṭa". / "Nidhattai" - arranging karmas in such a way that they can be applied in all karmas except for Udvartaṇakaraṇa and Apavartaṇakaraṇa is called "Nidhata". "Kaḍāi" - means "Kṛta" / "Kṛta" means to remove karmas, i.e., to arrange karmas in such a way that they are not eligible to be applied by all karmas. / "Paṭṭaviai" - ... - the arrangement of the Śonā is established with the rise of the karmas called Manuşyagati, Pañcendriyajāti, Trasa, Bādar, Payopta, Subhaga, Prādeya, and Yaśaḥkīti. "Nividaī" - the state of bound karmas as being in the form of three non-generators is the meaning of "Nivista". / "Abhinivitṭhai" - when the same karma is arranged as being a very intense generator of experience due to specific, more specific, and unique determination, then it is called "Abhinivista". "Abhisamannāgayaiṁ" - the karma's facing towards its rise is called "Abhisamanvāgata". / "Udiṇṇāi" - the karma's coming into rise, its attainment of rise is called "Udiṛṇa". That is, when karma begins to bear its fruit, it is called "Udayaprapta" or "Udiṛṇa". "No Uvasantaī" - the karma's not being pacified / There are two meanings of not being pacified here: (1) not attaining the complete absence of karma-bond, (2) or even after the karma-bond (Baddha) has been established, not being free from the agitation of the state of removal or rise, etc. / All these words are technical terms of karma-theory.  
Meaning - The meaning of these terms in this context is that the being in hell who has bound the Tīrthankara karma in the past and that bound karma has come into rise, 1.

[Twenty-first Interaction] [403 The same Naraka Tirthankara-pada is attained. He who did not have the bond of the Tirthankara name-karma in the past, or even if he had the bond, but did not have its rise, does not attain the Tirthankara-pada.'] The last four Naraka-shvīs, their Narakas, namely, उपलब्धि-पंक, धूम, तमः and तमस्तमः, cannot attain the Tirthankara-pada from their respective births on Earth. They can attain अन्तक्रिया, सर्वविरति, देश विरति, चारित्र and सम्यक्त्व respectively. From असुरकूमारादि to वनस्पतिकायिक—these beings cannot attain the Tirthankara-pada directly from their respective births, but they can attain अन्तक्रिया (moksha). In वसुदेवचरित, it is said that from among the Nagakumāras, one who is उद्वत्त, directly attains the ऐरवत क्षेत्र in this very अवपिणो काल as the twenty-fourth Tirthankara. What is the mystery in this matter, only a Kevali knows. Below is a table of this door, from which the evolution of a being can be known.

[404] [From the Prajñāpanā Sūtra, what is said, Bhante? ]  "Thus it is said, Gautama! Just as the hell-being of the Ratnaprābhā earth (Su. 1444) [1456 Pr.]  "Bhagavan!

[Twentieth Interaction Chapter] [405 Conclusion-Chakravarti Chapter] The beings who are eligible for the Chakravarti position are those who are born in the first hell and among the four types of gods, and then are born in the human realm. / The remaining beings (from the second to the seventh hell, and those born among the Tiryanchas and humans) are not.

* **Tapas:** *Balatapasvi* (those who practice austerities) who consume dry leaves or fallen leaves from trees.
* **Kandapika:** Those who practice *charitra* through their conduct, but who engage in *Kandarpa* (lust) and indecent behavior, laugh and joke, and make people laugh with their speech and actions. They amaze people by showing external miracles like sleight of hand, magic, etc.

## Twentieth: Interaction Word]] [409 

**If someone is a Nihnva (a person with corrupted right faith) with 409 merits, to which Devaloka (heavenly realm) does he go?**

**See the table below for the Devaloka destination based on the type of Sadhaka (practitioner):**

1. **Asanyata Bhavyadravyadeva (uncontrolled, possessing great wealth)**: From Bhavanavasi to Nau Naiveyak Devas
2. **Aviradhak (unobstructed) with Samyama (self-control)**: From Saudharmakalpa to Sarvarthasiddhi Vimana
3. **Viradhak (obstructed) with Samyama**: From Bhavanapati Devas to Saudharmakalpa
4. **Aviradhak with Samyamasanyama (Deshaviriti - restraint from worldly affairs)**: From Saudharmakalpa to Achyutakalpa
5. **Viradhak with Samyamasanyama**: From Bhavanavasi to Jyotishka Devas
6. **Akamanirjarashila Asangi (unattached, without desires)**: From Bhavanavasi to Vanavyantar Devas
7. **Tapas (ascetic)**: From Bhavanavasi to Jyotishka Devas
8. **Kandarsik (one who has conquered anger)**: From Bhavanavasi to Saudharmakalpa

13. **Prabhiyogika (one who engages in worldly activities)**: From Bhavanavasi to Achyutakalpa
14. **Svalingi (one who has attained self-realization) but Darshanabhrashta (corrupted faith)**: From Bhavanavasi to Greveyaka Deva

**Fruitful Meaning:**

Based on this entire discussion, the following conclusions can be drawn:

1. Even without internal merit, if external conduct is pure, the being goes to Aveyaka Devaloka.
2. This emphasizes the importance of eventually attaining Jain Dharma, as evident from the decisions given for Sadhakas number 1 and 14.
3. If one truly practices Samyama with internal merit, they reach the highest Devaloka, Sarvarthasiddhi.

**Asangi-Ayuष्यप्ररूपण (Life Span of Asangi)**

**1471. How many types of Asangi lifespan are mentioned, Bhagavan?**

**Gotama:** Four types of Asangi lifespan are mentioned:

1. **Neraiya Asangi (lowest Asangi)** to **Deva Asangi (highest Asangi)**.

[410] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra U.] Gautama! There are said to be four types of Asamjñi-prāyuṣya. They are as follows: from Nārayika-asamjñi-prāyuṣya up to Deva-asamjñi-prāyuṣya. 1472. Asamjñi, Bhante! Does he acquire Nārayika-prāyuṣya or does he acquire Deva-prāyuṣya? Gautama! He acquires both Nārayika-prāyuṣya and Deva-prāyuṣya. While acquiring Nārayika-prāyuṣya, he acquires a prāyuṣya of ten thousand years in the lowest and an immeasurable part of the highest Palyopam. While acquiring Tiryanchayonika-prāyuṣya, he acquires a prāyuṣya of the lowest Antomuhurta and an immeasurable part of the highest Palyopam. Similarly, one should say that he also acquires Manushaya-prāyuṣya and Deva-prāyuṣya like Nārayika-prāyuṣya. 1473. Bhante! Of this Nārayika-asamjñi-prāyuṣya up to Deva-asamjñi-prāyuṣya, which is the least, which is the most, which is equal, and which is special? (U.) Gautama! The least is Deva-asamjñi-prāyuṣya, Manushaya-asamjñi-prāyuṣya is immeasurable times more than that, Tiryanchayonika-asamjñi-prāyuṣya is immeasurable times more than that, and Nārayika-asamjñi-prāyuṣya is immeasurable times more than that. || Paṇṇavaṇāe Bhagavatiae Vīsaimaṁ Antakriyāpaṁ Samattaṁ || |1473 Pra.] Bhante! Of this Nārayika-asamjñi-prāyuṣya up to Deva-asamjñi-prāyuṣya, which is the least, which is the most, which is equal, and which is special? (U.) Gautama! The least is Deva-asamjñi-prāyuṣya, Manushaya-asamjñi-prāyuṣya is immeasurable times more than that, Tiryanchayonika-asamjñi-prāyuṣya is immeasurable times more than that, and Nārayika-asamjñi-prāyuṣya is immeasurable times more than that. Commentary—Asamjñi's prāyuṣya: type, state, and least-most—These three sūtras (1471 to 1473) discuss the binding of Nārayika-ādi prāyuṣya in the Asamjñi state, as well as the least-most of the binder and the bound. The intended meaning of Asamjñi-prāyuṣya is the prāyuṣya that a being binds while being Asamjñi and being fit for rebirth. Nārayika-asamjñi-prāyuṣya is the prāyuṣya of an Asamjñi who is fit for Nārayika. Similarly, one should understand Tiryanchayonika-asamjñi-prāyuṣya, Manushaya-asamjñi-prāyuṣya, and Deva-asamjñi-prāyuṣya.

## Twentieth Interrogation Chapter [411 should be taken. Although the lifespan experienced in the state of unconsciousness is also called unconscious lifespan, it is not being considered here. The four types of unconscious lifespan states - (1) The bondage of the lowest hell lifespan is said to be 10,000 years, which should be understood in relation to the first appearance (pathde) of the first hell. It should be understood that it earns a part of the countless parts of the hell lifespan palyaopam. This statement should be understood in relation to the middle position of the hell in the fourth layer of Ratnapraba earth. Because in the first appearance of Ratnapraba earth, the lowest position is 10,000 years, while the highest position is 60,000 years. In the second appearance, the lowest position is 10 lakh years and the highest position is 60 lakh years. Similarly, in the third appearance, the lowest position is 10 lakh years and the highest position is one koti पूर्व. In the fourth appearance, the lowest is one koti पूर्व and the highest position is one-tenth of the sagaropama. Therefore, here the position of the countless parts of the palyaopam is the middle one. The unconscious lifespan of the animal realm is said to be, at its best, a countless part of the palyaopam, which should be understood in relation to the paired animals. Similarly, the unconscious human lifespan, which is said to be, at its best, a countless part of the palyaopam, should also be understood in relation to the paired humans. The smallness of the unconscious lifespans should be understood in relation to the short and long lifespans of these four. // The twentieth interrogation chapter of the Prajnapanabhagavati is complete. // 1.

**Twenty-first:  The Establishment of Understanding**

* This is the twenty-first *Avagahana-Sansthana-Pada* of the *Prajnapana Sutra*.
* This *Pada* examines various aspects related to the body.  While the body was discussed in the twelfth *Sharira-Pada* and the sixteenth *Prayoga-Pada* of the previous *Padas*, this *Pada* focuses on which of the five bodies belong to which of the twenty-four *Dandakas* (hells, etc.), and how many bodies, both bound and liberated, exist in terms of substance, region, and time.  The sixteenth *Prayoga-Pada* describes the activities and movements of the soul based on mind, speech, and body.
* This *Avagahana-Sansthana-Pada* elaborates on the types, shapes, sizes, *Pudgala* accumulation, number of bodies found in a single being, the scarcity and abundance of substances and regions within the body, and the scarcity and abundance of *Avagahana* through seven gates.
* The body is the closest to the soul and aids in spiritual practice.  Self-development, chanting, austerities, meditation, service, etc., can only be achieved with a healthy and strong body.  The *Aharaka* body is so miraculous, light, divine, magnificent, and crystal-like that if a *Chaturdasha-Purvadhari* monk has any doubts, he sends this body to the *Tirthankara*.  He receives his answers through this body.  After that, the body quickly merges back into the *Audarika* body.
* This *Pada* has seven gates: (1) *Vidhi-Dwar*, (2) *Sansthana-Dwar*, (3) *Pramana-Dwar*, (4) *Pudgala-Chayana-Dwar*, (5) *Sharira-Sanyoga-Dwar*, (6) *Dravya-Pradesha-Alp-Bahutva-Dwar*, and (7) *Sharira-Avagahana-Alp-Bahutva-Dwar*.
* The first *Vidhi-Dwar* describes the five main types of bodies and the variations from one-sense to five-sense bodies.  The five main types of bodies are: *Audarika*, *Vaikriya*, *Aharaka*, *Tejas*, and *Karman*.
* The Upanishads discuss the five sheaths of the soul.  Of these, only the *Annamaya-Kosha* is associated with the *Audarika* body.

Twenty-first: Understanding the Body-Institution-Position] [413 The body can be compared to the subtle, microscopic, or linga body described in the Sankhya and other philosophies, which can be compared to the Karman body according to Jainism. 'First, the distinctions, institutions, and proofs of the Audarik body have been taken together in order. / In the enumeration of the distinctions of the Audarik body, as many distinctions of the Audarik body have been counted as there are distinctions of living beings from one-sensed to five-sensed human beings. The institution of the Audarik body - its form - has also been considered in the same order of living beings. The earth-bodied is like a lentil, the water-bodied is like a still drop of water, the fire-bodied is like a pile of needles, the air-bodied is like a flag, and the plant-bodied is of various kinds. The two-sensed to four-sensed and the fully-developed five-sensed have a hudak institution. Except for the fully-developed, the other Audarik-bodied beings have six types of institutions. The proofs of the Audarik and other bodies, i.e., height, have also been considered in relation to the one-sensed and other beings. The Vaikriya body has also been considered according to the distinctions of living beings. Among them, the cloud-sufficient air and the five-sensed Tiryanchas have the said body in the number of years of life, sufficient womb-born, and among the sufficient humans, it is only the future of the karma-field. All the gods and narakas have a Vaikriya body, this has been stated and its nature has been described. The Bhavadharani and Uttarvaikriya, both have been kept in mind. * The Aharak body is of only one type. It is only for the prosperous, deluded, restrained human being of the karma-field. / Its institution is square. The excellent height is as much as a full hand. / * The Tejas and Karman bodies are for all beings from one-sensed to five-sensed. / Therefore, there are as many distinctions of it as there are distinctions of beings. The understanding of the Tejas and Karman bodies has been considered with the goal of the death-causing-destruction. The understanding of where the being goes after death is mentioned here. * The fourth gate also mentions how many directions the pudgals are chosen, increased, and decreased for the formation of the body. * The fifth gate mentions how many bodies can be in one being at the same time. / * The sixth gate discusses the scarcity and abundance of the substances and regions of the body. / * The seventh gate expounds the scarcity and abundance of understanding in relation to the inferior, medium, and excellent. / All these topics are clear in the original text. 1.

## Twenty-first Avagahaana-Sansthaana-Pada [415]

**Characteristics of the Five Bodies**

**(1) Audarik Body:** The body which is *udhaar* (principal) is called the Audarik body. The principal nature of the Audarik body is in comparison to the Audarik bodies of Tirthankaras, Ganadharas, etc. Alternatively, *udhaar* means vast or large in size. Since the Audarik body can be more than a thousand yojanas long, it is vast in size compared to other bodies. This vastness of the Audarik body should be understood in comparison to the Bhavadhaaranee body, otherwise the Uttar Vaikriya body can be even a hundred thousand yojanas long.

**(2) Vaikriya Body:** The body through which various, specific or unique actions take place is called the Vaikriya body. The body which is one becomes many, many become one, small becomes large and large becomes small, aerial becomes terrestrial and terrestrial becomes aerial, and visible becomes invisible and invisible becomes visible, etc., is the Vaikriya body. It is of two types: *aupapatik* (innate) and *lobdha-pratyaya*. The *aupapatik* Vaikriya body is of the gods and narakas born from *aupapatik* birth, and the *lobdha-pratyaya* Vaikriya body is due to *labdhi* (attainment), which is found in some Tiryanchas and humans.

**(3) Aahaarak Body:** The body which is formed by the special *ahaarak-labdhi* (attainment of food) for the purpose of seeing, etc., by the *Chaturdasha-purvadhaari* Munis and Tirthankaras is called the Aahaarak body. "The body is formed by the special *labdhi* of the Jina Bhagwan for the purpose of *pranidaya* (compassion) by the Shruta-kevala, seeing the *riddhi* (powers) of Tirthankaras, etc., understanding subtle substances, and for resolving any doubts, and for going to the feet of the Jina Bhagwan." This body is made up of a very auspicious and pure group of *pudgalas* (particles) similar to a crystal stone, and is more auspicious than the Vaikriya body.

**(4) Tejas Body:** The body which is formed from *tejas-pudgalas* (particles of light) is called the Tejas body. This body is the cause of heat and the digestion of consumed food. Due to the Tejas body, *tejo-leshya* (radiance) emanates from the body of a man with special *tapojanit* *labdhi* (attainment through austerities). This Tejas body is present in all worldly beings. It is perceived by the heat of the body, which digests food and transforms it into *rasa* (essence), etc., or due to *tejo-labdhi*. Therefore, it should be understood as the Tejas body.

---------------------------
##  Translation:

**[416]** **[Prajñāpanā Sūtra (5)]** The Karmic Body - The body which is born of karma, or which is the modification of karma, is the Karmic Body. The meaning is that the karma particles, like milk and water, combine with the soul's attributes and become one, transforming into the form of a body. Then they are called the Karmic Body. It is also said, "The Karmic Body is the modification (work) of karma, it is born from the eight types of diverse karma. This body should be understood as the cause of all bodies." Therefore, the Karmic Body is the seed form (cause form) of all bodies, including the Audārika body. Until the Karmic Body, which is the seed of the sprout-like cycle of existence, is destroyed, the emergence of the remaining bodies cannot stop. This Karmic Body is the cause of the soul's transition to another state (after death). When the soul, combined with the Karmic Body and the Tejas, dies and goes to another state, or comes from another state to the human state, it is not visible to the naked eye due to the extreme subtlety of those particles. The other Tirthankaras have also said, "This body of existence remains even in between (birth and death), but due to its extreme subtlety, it is not visible when it exits or enters the body." In other religions, the subtle and causal body is considered in place of the Tejas and Karmic Body.

**[1476]** **[Pr.]**  O Bhagavan! How many types of Audārika body are there? **[U.]** Gautama! It is said to be of five types. It is as follows:  Ekeindriya-Audārika body to Panchendriya-Audārika body.

**[1477]** **[Pr.]** O Bhagavan! How many types of Ekeindriya-Audārika body are there? **[U.]** Gautama! It (Ekeindriya-Audārika body) is said to be of five types. It is as follows:  Pṛthvīkāyika Ekeindriya-Audārika body to Vanaspatikāyika Ekeindriya-Audārika body.

**Special meanings of words like Masoorchand etc.**

* **Masoorchand Santhan:** Masoor is a type of grain from which dal is made. Masoor's Chandra means crescent-shaped half-dal (dal). Masoorchand; its shape.
* **Thibugbindu Santhan:** Stibukbindu is like a water bubble, which does not scatter or spread due to air etc., but is collected, then it is called Stibukbindu, its shape.
* **Nana Santhan Santhiya:** Due to the difference in their shape due to the difference in country, caste and time etc., they are of various shapes.

**Institution: Type and Form**

The specific shape or structure of the body is called an institution. It has 6 types:

1. Samchaturasra
2. Nyagrodha-Parimandal
3. Saadi (Swati)
4. Vaman
5. Kubjak
6. Hundak Santhan

The form of all six is as follows:

1. **Samchaturasra:** The body whose four corners or divisions are equal according to the signs mentioned in the Samudrik Shastra.

Page #1016:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**[428]**  According to the *Prajñāpanā*, there are nine types of body structures in terrestrial five-sensed beings:

(1) **Samcaturasrasamsthāna:** This structure is characterized by a body with a square shape.

(2) **Nyagrodhaparimaṇḍalasamsthāna:** This structure is named after the *Nyagrodha* tree (Banyan tree). Just as the upper part of the Banyan tree is wide and full, while the lower part is thin and narrow, similarly, a body with a full upper part (above the navel) and a thin lower part (below the navel) is called *Nyagrodhaparimaṇḍalasamsthāna*.

(3) **Sādisamsthāna:** The word *Sādi* refers to the lower part of the body, below the navel. A body with a full lower part (including the *Prādi* - the area below the navel) and a thin upper part is called *Sādisamsthāna*. Some teachers also call it *Sācisamsthāna*. *Sācī* refers to the *Śālmalī* tree (Silk Cotton tree). The trunk of the *Śālmalī* tree is very thick, but the upper part is not as wide or thick. Similarly, a body with a thick and full lower part and a thin upper part is called *Sācisamsthāna*.

(4) **Kubjakasamsthāna:** This structure is characterized by a body with a normal size of head, neck, arms, and legs, but with a bent, crooked, or humped chest and abdomen.

(5) **Vāmanasamsthāna:** This structure is characterized by a body with a normal size of chest and abdomen, but with thin arms, legs, and other limbs. Such a body is considered dwarf-like.

(6) **Huṇḍakasamsthāna:** This structure is characterized by a body with all limbs and organs being crooked and lacking in proper size and features.

**Nine *Ālāpaka* for Terrestrial Five-Sensed Beings:**

These nine *Ālāpaka* are as follows:

* One *Ālāpaka* for the collective five-sensed terrestrial beings, one for their *Paryāptakas* (those who have attained perfection), and one for their *Aparyāptakas* (those who have not attained perfection), making a total of three *Ālāpaka*.
* One *Ālāpaka* for the *Sammūcchima* five-sensed terrestrial beings, two for their *Paryāptakas* and *Aparyāptakas*, making a total of three *Ālāpaka*.
* One *Ālāpaka* for the *Garbhaj* five-sensed terrestrial beings, one for their *Paryāptakas*, and one for their *Aparyāptakas*, making a total of three *Ālāpaka*.

These nine *Ālāpaka* make a total of nine *Ālāpaka* for terrestrial five-sensed beings.

**Nine Sutras for the *Audārika* Body of Terrestrial Five-Sensed Beings:**

There are nine *Sutras* related to the *Audārika* body of terrestrial five-sensed beings:

* One *Sutra* for the collective terrestrial beings, one for their *Paryāptakas*, and one for their *Aparyāptakas*.
* One *Sutra* for the *Sammūcchima* terrestrial beings, one for their *Paryāptakas*, and one for their *Aparyāptakas*.
* One *Sutra* for the *Garbhaj* terrestrial beings, one for their *Paryāptakas*, and one for their *Aparyāptakas*.

These nine *Sutras* make a total of nine *Sutras* for the *Audārika* body of terrestrial five-sensed beings.

**The Size of the *Audārika* Body:**

**[1502]**  **Question:**  O Venerable One! How is the size of the *Audārika* body described?

**Answer:**  Gautama! The size of the *Audārika* body is described as being at least as small as an immeasurable fraction of an *angula* (finger width) and at most as large as a few thousand *yojanas* (a unit of distance).

Pragyapana Sutra: The infinitesimal part of twelve yojana-angulas is the infinitesimal part of three gavyutis (6 kos). The infinitesimal part of one thousand yojanas is the infinitesimal part of six gavyutis. The coarse vegetation of the paryaptas (fully developed beings) is the coarse vegetation, and the subtle vegetation of the aparyaptas (partially developed beings) is the subtle vegetation. The yaudarikas (physical bodies) of the paryaptas and aparyaptas are as follows:

1. The yaudarikas of the dvindriyas (two-sensed beings).
2. The yaudarikas of the trindriyas (three-sensed beings).
3. The yaudarikas of the chaturindriyas (four-sensed beings).
4. The yaudarikas of the pancendriyas (five-sensed beings).
5. The yaudarikas of the sammuchchhimas (spontaneously born beings).
6. The yaudarikas of the garbhajas (embryonically born beings).
7. The yaudarikas of the jalacharas (aquatic beings).
8. The yaudarikas of the sthalachairas (terrestrial beings).
9. The yaudarikas of the khechara (aerial beings).
10. The yaudarikas of the manushyas (humans).

All of them have a Vaikriya body / There are two types of Kalpatita Vaimanika Devas: Veyakavasi and Anuttaraupathika / Veyak Devas are of nine types, and Anuttaraupathika are of five types / All of these should be said to have two divisions based on the perception of sufficient and insufficient. All of these have a Vaikriya body / In the seven Sutras (1514 to 1520) presenting the divisions and subdivisions of the Vivechana-Vaikriya body, all the divisions and subdivisions of the Vaikriya body in the context of its method of attainment have been described, both in terms of its one-sense and five-sense aspects. The implication of the description of all the divisions and subdivisions of the Falitartha-Vaikriya body is that only the sufficient Badara Vayukayika beings among the one-sense beings have a Vaikriya body. Among the five-sense beings, the five-sense Tiryanchas have a Vaikriya body in the case of the numbered-year-lifespan, womb-born, sufficient beings; while among humans, the five-sense, womb-born, karma-field, numbered-year-lifespan, sufficient humans have a Vaikriya body / Among Devas, all types of sufficient and insufficient Bhavanapatis, Vanavyantaras, Jyotishkas and Vaimanikas have a Vaikriya body. Among Narakas, all the Narakas of the seven Naraka-prithvis, both sufficient and insufficient, have a Vaikriya body. The conclusion is that among the Vayukayikas, the sufficient, insufficient, subtle and insufficient Badara Vayukayikas do not attain a Vaikriya body. Among the five-sense beings, the aquatic, terrestrial quadruped, chest-crawling, belly-crawling and aerial Tiryancha five-sense beings, and among humans, except for the womb-born, sufficient, numbered-year-lifespan humans, the rest of the humans do not have the possibility of attaining a Vaikriya body / Vanamantaranam Avihanam - Vanavyantara Devas are of 8 types: (1) Yaksha, (2) Rakshasa, (3) Kinnara, (4) Kimpurusha, (5) Bhut, (6) Pishacha, (7) Gandharva and (8) Mahoraga / Joisiyanam Panchavihanam - Jyotishka Devas are of 5 types: (1) Chandra, (2) Surya, (3) Graha, (4) Nakshatra and (5) Tara / Gevejjaga Gavaviha - Veyak Devas are of nine types.

There is an āhāra-gaśarīra for those who are born in the womb, who are karmabhūmika, who have a lifespan of a definite number of years, who are perfect in knowledge, who are restrained, who are heedless, and who have attained ṛddhis, but not for those who are born in the womb, who are karmabhūmika, who have a lifespan of a definite number of years, who are perfect in knowledge, who are restrained, who are heedless, and who have not attained ṛddhis. / Discussion The present sūtra (Sū. 1533) discusses in ten parts who has a single type of āhāra-gaśarīra and who does not. Conclusion - There is only one type of āhāra-gaśarīra, and it is possessed by those who are born in the womb, who are karmabhūmika, who are perfect in knowledge, who are restrained, who are heedless, and who have attained ṛddhis. / 'Saṃjata' etc. words have special meanings. Those who are heedless are those who, due to the arising of karma such as delusion, and due to any heedlessness from the burning passions such as sleep, find it difficult to practice restraint. / They are usually gacchavāsī (sthavira-kalpī), because they are sometimes useless. / Those who are not heedless are the opposite of these, and they are usually jina-kalpī, parihāra-viśuddhika, yathā-laṃdaka-kalpika, and pratima-pratipanna sādhus. They are always useful. / / One clarification - According to Jain doctrine, jina-kalpī etc. are not labdhi-upajīvī. Because their kalpa is the same. / Those who are gacchavāsī and who create an āhāra-gaśarīra are heedless at that time due to being labdhi-upajīvī and due to curiosity. They are also heedless when they abandon the āhāra-gaśarīra. In the audārika-gaśarīra, they experience anxiety due to the complete withdrawal of the ātmā-pradeśas (from all sides). They remain in the āhāra-gaśarīra for a moment. Therefore, although a little purity arises for a short time during that period, the karma-granthakāra calls this state non-heedlessness, but in reality, they are heedless due to being labdhi-upajīvī.

English translation preserving Jain terms:

[Prajnapana Sutra 1538. Just as the divisions of the audarika (gross) body are stated (in Sutras 1477-1481), so also the divisions of the tejas (fiery) body up to the caturindriya (four-sensed beings) should be stated. [1538 Pr.] 

1539. [1] Bhante! In how many ways is the pañcendriya (five-sensed) tejas body classified? Gautama! It is classified in four ways, namely, the nairayika (hellish) tejas body up to the devateja (divine) body. [1536-1 Pr.]

[2] The two-fold division of the raikas (hellish beings) should be stated as in the vaikriya (transformable) body (Sutra 1517-2). [1536-2]

[3] The divisions of the pañcendriya (five-sensed) tiryañca (animals) and manusya (human) beings should be stated as in the case of the audarika (gross) body (Sutras 1482-1487). [1536-3] 

[4] The divisions of the devas (celestial beings) should be stated as in the case of the vaikriya (transformable) body (Sutra 1520) up to the sarvartha-siddha devas. [1536-4]

Explanation - The divisions and sub-divisions of the tejas (fiery) body are expounded in the present 4 Sutras (1536 to 1539). The tejas body is necessarily present in all living beings from the one-sensed to the five-sensed. Therefore, the number of divisions of the tejas body is equal to the number of divisions of the living beings. Just as the divisions of the audarika (gross) body from the one-sensed to the four-sensed have been stated, so also the divisions of their tejas body should be stated. The four divisions of the pañcendriya (five-sensed) tejas body, namely, the nairayika (hellish), tiryañca (animal), manusya (human) and deva (celestial) have been stated. Among them, the two-fold division of the raikas (hellish beings) into paryaptas (complete) and aparyaptas (incomplete) as in the case of the vaikriya (transformable) body, should also be stated for their tejas body. The divisions of the tejas body of the pañcendriya (five-sensed) tiryañca (animals) and manusya (human) beings should be stated as many as the divisions of their audarika (gross) body. The divisions of the tejas body of the four classes of devas up to the sarvartha-siddha devas should be stated as many as the divisions of their vaikriya (transformable) body.

## Twenty-first Avagahana-Samsthana-Pada [467]

From Lokanta to Lokanta, meaning from the extreme end of Adholoka to the extreme end of Urvaloka, or from the extreme end of Urvaloka to the extreme end of Adholoka. This excellent Avagahana of the Tejas Sharira should be understood in relation to the Tejas Sharira of a Sukshma or Badara Ekendriya. Because only Sukshma and Badara Ekendriya reside in all the Lokas as per their suitability. Other Jivas do not. Therefore, except for Ekendriya, no other Jiva can have such an Avagahana. In the present context, the Tejas Sharira Avagahana is described with the goal of reaching the destination where the Jiva goes after death, through the process of dying and taking birth in a particular Yoni. Therefore, when an Ekendriya Jiva (Sukshma or Badara) is situated at the extreme end of Adholoka at the time of death and is going to be born at the extreme end of Urvaloka, or when it is situated at the extreme end of Urvaloka at the time of death and is going to be born at the extreme end of Adholoka, and when it performs the Maranantik Samudghat, then its excellent Avagahana is from Lokanta to Lokanta.

From Tiryaloka to Lokanta, meaning from Tiryaloka to Adholokanta or to Urddhva-Lokanta. The intention is that when a Dwiendriya Jiva situated in Tiryaloka is going to be born as an Ekendriya in Urddhva Lokanta or Adholokanta, and performs the Maranantik Samudghat, then the aforementioned Avagahana of the Tejas Sharira takes place.

The Avagahana is up to the Pushkarini situated in Pandakavana. This means that the Avagahana from the seventh Naraka-Prithvi up to the Tirchha Swayambhuraman Samudra-Paryanta and above to the Pandakavana Pushkarini is found only when a Naraka of the seventh Naraka is born in the Paryanta-bhaga of the Swayambhuraman Samudra in the form of a Matsya or in the Pushkarinis of Pandakavana. Then the Tejas Sharira Avagahana of that Naraka of the seventh Prithvi is that much.

The Avagahana of the Tejas Sharira of a Dwiendriya is described as being smaller than the Payama of a Dwiendriya, being an infinitesimal part of an Angula. This much Avagahana of a Dwiendriya happens only when an insufficiently endowed Dwiendriya with a body the size of an infinitesimal part of an Angula is born as an Ekendriya in its nearby region. Or, the Avagahana is considered in relation to the dimensions, circumference, and extent of the Tejas Sharira that emerges from the body in which the Maranantik Samudghat takes place, not including the body itself. Otherwise, the Payama of Bhavanapati etc. being described as an infinitesimal part of an Angula will be contradictory, because the body of Bhavanapati etc. is seven Hasta-pramana and above. Therefore, the correct fact is that even when a Maha-kaya Dwiendriya Jiva is born as an Ekendriya in its nearby region, its Tejas Sharira Avagahana should be understood as being the size of an infinitesimal part of an Angula.

The Avagahana of the Tejas Sharira of a Naraka is described as being smaller than the Payama, being one thousand Yojanas. It should be understood in this way: Valyamukha etc., the four Patala-Kalasha, have an Avagahana of one lakh Yojanas. Their thickness is one thousand Yojanas. The lower part of those Patala-Kalasha is filled with air, the upper part is filled with water, and the middle part is the path for the flow and outflow of air and water. When a Simantaka etc.

Page #1056:
---------------------------
[468] In the *Prajñāpanā Sūtra*, it is stated that when a being in the *Pātāla Kalasa* (a hell) dies due to the exhaustion of its lifespan, it is reborn as a fish in the second or third division of the *Pātāla Kalasa*, after penetrating the thousand-yojana thick wall of the *Pātāla Kalasa*. At that time, the *taijas-śarīra-avagāhanā* (the extent of the subtle body) of that hell-being, due to the *māraṇāntika-samudghāta* (the violent death), is slightly more than a thousand yojanas. 

The *taijas-śarīra-avagāhanā* of a human being is said to be from the *samaya-kṣetra* (the time-field) to the *loka-anta* (the end of the world). This means that the *taijas-śarīra-avagāhanā* of a human being should be understood to be from the human realm to the extreme end of the lower realms or the extreme end of the upper realms, because it is possible for a human being to be born in an *eka-indriya* (a being with one sense organ). 

The implication is that the birth or death of a human being is not possible outside the *samaya-kṣetra*. Therefore, their *taijas-śarīra-avagāhanā* cannot be greater than this. It is called the *samaya-kṣetra* because this region, which is the size of two and a half *dvīpa* (continents), is the dominant region of time due to the movement of the sun and other celestial bodies.

The *taijas-śarīra-avagāhanā* of the gods from the *Vānavyantara* (a heaven) to the *Saudharmā Iśāna* (a heaven) is said to be from an infinitesimal part of a finger in length to the extreme end of the third hell-earth below, diagonally to the outer edge of the *Svayambhūramaṇa* ocean, and upwards to the *Īṣat-prāg-bhāra* earth. 

This means that all the *bhavana-pati* (lords of the mansions), *vyantara* (intermediate gods), *jyotiṣka* (celestial beings), and *Saudharmā-Iśāna* gods are also born in *eka-indriya* realms. When they die, they are reborn as earth-bodied beings in their nearby ornaments, such as their *keyūra* (armlets), *kuṇḍala* (earrings), or *padmarāga* (ruby) gems, while they are still infatuated and unconscious in those ornaments. At that time, the *taijas-śarīra-avagāhanā* of those gods is an infinitesimal part of a finger. 

When a *bhavana-pati* or other god goes to the extreme end of the third hell-earth for some purpose and dies there due to the exhaustion of their lifespan, they are reborn as an earth-bodied being in the outer edge of the *Svayambhūramaṇa* ocean or in the region of the *Īṣat-prāg-bhāra* earth. At that time, their *taijas-śarīra-avagāhanā* is from the extreme end of the third hell-earth below, to the outer edge of the *Svayambhūramaṇa* ocean in the middle, and upwards to the region of the *Īṣat-prāg-bhāra* earth.

The *taijas-śarīra-avagāhanā* of the *Sanatkumāra* and other gods is as follows: The *Sanatkumāra* and other gods are not born in *eka-indriya* or *vikala-indriya* (imperfect sense organ) realms due to their nature. They are born only in *pañcendriya* (five sense organ) realms or as human beings. Therefore, when they die while bathing in the *mandara* mountain's pond, they are reborn as fish in the nearby region. At that time, the *taijas-śarīra-avagāhanā* of their subtle body is an infinitesimal part of a finger. 

If a *Sanatkumāra* or other god goes to the *Acyutakalpa* (a heaven) at the invitation of another god and dies there due to the exhaustion of their lifespan, they are reborn in the region of the *Svayambhūramaṇa* ocean or in the second or third division of the *Pātāla Kalasa*.

[Twenty-first Avagaha-Samsthana-Pada] When it takes birth in the form of a fish etc., then one should understand that its upward, downward and diagonal, aforementioned Tejassharira Avagaha takes place. The upward Tejassharira Avagaha of Achyut Devas remains only up to the Achyut Vimana / Therefore, while describing the form of its Tejassharira Avagaha, one should not say up to Achyutkalpa. This Deva certainly resides in Achyutkalpa, but perhaps it goes up to the height of its Vimana, and if its lifespan ends there, then it is born in the Achyut Vimana after falling down / Then its Tejassharira Avagaha is so much / Karma-ran-sharira in Vidhi-Samsthana-Praman-Dwar 1552. "Bhagavan! How many types of Karman-sharira are said?" [U.] "Gautama! (It) is said to be of five types. It is as follows - Ekendriya Karman-sharira (to) Yavat Panchendriya Karman-sharira / In the same way as the distinction, Samsthana and Avagaha of Tejassharira have been described (from Su. 1536 to 1551), in the same way, the entire statement (from Ekendriya Karman-sharira to) Yavat Anuttaroppapatik (-Devapanchendriya Karman-sharira should be done.) Discussion - Karman-sharira: Companion of Tejassharira - Where there is Tejassharira, there will definitely be Karman-sharira and where there is Karman-sharira, there will definitely be Tejassharira. There is an inseparable relationship between the two. The consideration of Avagaha of both Tejass-Karman is done especially keeping in mind the Maranantik Samudghat. Karman-sharira is also Samsthana-wala according to the regions of the Jiva, like Tejassharira / Therefore, just as it has been said about the types, Samsthana and Avagaha of Tejassharira, in the same way, instructions have been given for the statement about the types, Samsthana and Avagaha of Karman-sharira. Pudgal-Chayan-Dwar 1553. "Bhagavan! How many directions does the Oraliya-sharira attract Pudgal?" "Gautama! It attracts in many directions, it attracts in two directions, it attracts in three directions, it attracts in four directions, it attracts in five directions / 1. Prajnapana.

##  Translation:

**470** [**Prajñāpanasūtra [1553]**] **Bhagavan!** How many directions are there from which **pudgalas** are chosen for the **Audārika** body? [**U.** **Gautama!** From six directions in terms of **niyāghāta**, from perhaps three directions in terms of **vyāghāta**, perhaps from four directions, and perhaps from five directions (pudgalas are chosen). **1554.** **Beoubdhiyasarīras** **Bhagavan!** How many directions are there from which **pudgalas** are chosen for the **Vaikriya** body? [**U.**] **Gautama!** From six directions according to the rule (pudgalas are chosen). **1555.** Similarly (as the **Vaikriya** body), the **pudgalas** of the **Āhārakas** body are also chosen from six directions according to the rule. **1556.** The **Taijasa** and **Karmāṇa** (bodies' pudgalas are chosen) [as stated in **Sūtra 1553**] are similar to the **Audārika** body (in terms of pudgala selection). **1557.** **Bhagavan!** How many directions are there from which **pudgalas** are **upacita** for the **Audārika** body? [**U.**] **Gautama!** (As it was said regarding selection), similarly (regarding **upacaya** from the **Audārika** body to) the **Karmāṇa** body (should be said). **1558.** (As the **pudgalas** of the five bodies, **Audārika** etc., are) **upacita**, similarly (they are) **avacita**.

**Discussion:** The consideration of the selection, **upacaya**, and **avacaya** of the **pudgalas** of the five bodies is presented in six **sūtras** (from 1553 to 1558) in this fourth **dvāra**.

**Definition of Selection, Upacaya, and Avacaya:**

* **Selection** means the accumulation, collection, or gathering of **pudgalas**.
* **Upacaya** means the selection in abundance, increase, or growth.
* **Avacaya** means the decrease, reduction, or removal of **pudgalas**.

Page #1059:
---------------------------
[Twenty-first Avagahaanasthana Pada] [471] For the formation, growth and decay of the Audarik, Tejas and Karman bodies, the pudgalas are chosen by themselves, and the upacaya occurs from all six directions (east, west, north, south, upward and downward) if there is no obstruction (hindrance or obstacle) of any kind, and the pudgalas are themselves apacita / The meaning is that when the living being, the holder of the Audarik, Tejas and Karman bodies, located inside or outside the sanad, is not obstructed by any direction, then the arrival or departure of pudgalas occurs from all six directions as a rule. The Vaikriya body and the Aharak body are possible only in the Trasanadi, not elsewhere / There is no obstruction of any kind of Alok there, therefore, the selection and upacaya of pudgalas for them occurs from all six directions as a rule. ' But if there is an obstruction in the arrival of the pudgalas of the Audarik, Tejas and Karman bodies, i.e., if there is a slip or obstruction from Alok or going, then perhaps their pudgalas are chosen and upacaya occurs from three, perhaps four and perhaps five directions. The implication is that if there is Alok in one direction, then from five directions, if there is Alok in two directions, then from four directions, and if there is Alok in three directions, then the selection and upacaya of pudgalas occurs from three directions / For example, there is a subtle living being who is the holder of an Audarik body and is located in the Lokanta in the form of Pragneya Kona in the highest (Sarvorva) Pratar of the Lok, above which (there is no Lokakash, there is no Lok in the east and south directions, that living being will choose and upacaya the pudgalas from the downward direction, the west and north directions, these three directions, because the remaining three directions are filled with Alok / When the same Audarik body-bearing subtle living being is in the west direction, then the east direction becomes more for him, therefore, the arrival of pudgalas will be from four directions / When that living being is in the second or any other Pratar in the downward direction, and is located taking the support of the west direction, then if the upward direction is also more available there, then only the south direction is obstructed by Alok, therefore, the arrival (selection) of pudgalas occurs from all five directions there / / The Tejas Karman body is of all worldly living beings, therefore, their selection and upacaya should also be understood like the Audarik body. Just as the selection has been stated, so should the upacaya and apacaya be stated / 5-Sharir Samyoga Dvara 1559. Jassanam Bante! Oraliyasariram Tass Nan Veubviyasariram?

[Twenty-first Avagahanasthanapada] [473 [U.] Gautama! The being who has a Vaikriya body does not have an Aharaka body, and the being who has an Aharaka body does not have a Vaikriya body. [2] Just as (in Sutra 1561-62) the combination of Tejas and Karman (bodies) is mentioned with Audarika, in the same way, the combination of Tejas and Karman bodies should be mentioned with Aharaka body. 1563-2] Just as (in Sutra 1561-1562) the combination of Tejas and Karman (bodies) is mentioned with Audarika, in the same way, the combination of Tejas and Karman bodies should be mentioned with Aharaka body. 1564. Bhagavan! Does the being who has a Tejas body also have a Karman body? (And) does the being who has a Karman body also have a Tejas body? [U.] Gautama! The being who has a Tejas body, by rule, definitely has a Karman body, and the being who has a Karman body, definitely has a Tejas body. / Discussion - Consideration of the mutual combination of bodies - In the present 6 Sutras (from 1556 to 1564) of the Samyoga-dvara, it has been considered how many bodies out of the five bodies, Audarika etc., are possible in a being at the same time! The meaning of these Sutras is as follows: 1. Audarika can be combined with Vaikriya, Aharaka, Tejas, Karman. 2. Vaikriya can be combined with Audarika, Tejas, Karman bodies. / 3. Aharaka can be combined with Audarika, Tejas, Karman bodies. / 4. Tejas can be combined with Audarika, Vaikriya, Aharaka, Karman bodies. 5. Karman can be combined with Audarika, Vaikriya, Aharaka, Tejas bodies. Explanation - (1) The being who has an Audarika body, by choice, has a Vaikriya body. Because if a being with an Audarika body, who has attained Vaikriya, creates a Vaikriya body, then he has a Vaikriya body. / The being who has not attained Vaikriya, or who has attained Vaikriya but does not create a Vaikriya body, does not have a Vaikriya body. Devas and Narakas have Vaikriya bodies, they do not have Audarika bodies, but those who are Tiryanch or humans who have Vaikriya bodies, have Audarika bodies. / (2) The being who has an Audarika body, may or may not have an Aharaka body.

[474] The *prajnapana* body is not present in the remaining *praudarik* embodied humans. Similarly, if a being has a *paharak* body, it must have an *audarik* body, because without an *audarik* body, there is no possibility of obtaining food. A *vaikriya* body and a *praharak* body, or a *paharak* body and a *vaikriya* body, are never possible together. (3) If a being has an *audarik* body, it must have *taijas* and *karman* bodies, but if a being has *taijas* and *karman* bodies, it may or may not have an *audarik* body, because even though gods and hell beings have *taijas* and *karman* bodies, they do not have an *audarik* body. Similarly, if a being has a *vaikriya* body, it must have *taijas* and *karman* bodies, but if a being has *taijas* and *karman* bodies, it may or may not have a *vaikriya* body, because gods and hell beings have *taijas* and *karman* bodies, and every god also has a *vaikriya* body, but the *kriya* body of animals and humans is not present from birth, but *taijas* and *karman* bodies are definitely present. If a being has a *taijas* body, it may or may not have an *audarik* body, because humans and animals have an *audarik* body and a *taijas* body, while gods and hell beings who have a *vaikriya* body have a *taijas* body, but not an *audarik* body. Similarly, if a being has a *praudarik* body, it must have *taijas* and *karman* bodies, because without *taijas* and *karman* bodies, an *audarik* body is impossible. Similarly, *taijas* and *karman* are both mutually inseparable. If a being has a *taijas* body, it must have a *karman* body. If a being has a *karman* body, it must have a *taijas* body. / 44 6. **Dravya-Pradesha-Alp-Bahutva-Dwar** 1565. "Thus, O Venerable One! Of these five bodies, *audarik*, *vaikriya*, *aharak*, *taijas*, and *karman*, which is less, which is more, which is equal, or which is superior in terms of *dravya*, in terms of *pradesha*, and in terms of both *dravya* and *pradesha*?" 44.

[Twenty-first Avagahaanasthana Pada] [U] Gautama! The Aharaka body is the smallest in terms of dravya. (From them) Vaikriya bodies are innumerable times more than dravya. (From them) Audarika bodies are innumerable times more than dravya. (From them) Taijasa and Karmana bodies are both equal (equal), (but from Audarika bodies) they are infinite times more than dravya. (From them) Aharaka bodies are the smallest in terms of pradesha. (From them) Vaikriya bodies are innumerable times more than pradesha. (From them) Audarika bodies are innumerable times more than pradesha. (From them) Taijasa bodies are infinite times more than pradesha, (from them) Karmana bodies are infinite times more than pradesha. In terms of dravya and pradesha - in terms of dravya, the smallest are - Aharaka bodies. (From them) Vaikriya bodies are innumerable times more than dravya. (From them) Audarika bodies are innumerable times more than dravya. From the Audarika bodies, the Aharaka bodies are infinite times more than pradesha in terms of dravya: (From them) Vaikriya bodies are innumerable times more than pradesha. (From them) Audarika bodies are innumerable times more than pradesha. Taijasa and Karmana, both bodies, are equal (equal) in terms of dravya; and are infinite times more than dravya. (From them) Taijasa bodies are infinite times more than pradesha. (From them) Karmana bodies are infinite times more than pradesha. Discussion - Consideration of the bodies as small and large: The above mentioned five bodies have been considered in terms of their smallness and largeness in the sutra (1565) presented from the perspective of dravya, pradesha and dravya and pradesha. Explanation - In terms of dravya, i.e., in terms of the number of dravya in the body, the Aharaka body is the smallest because even if the Aharaka body is of a large number, it is only Sahasra Prithaktva (from two thousand to nine thousand). Compared to all Aharaka bodies, Vaikriya bodies are innumerable times more in terms of dravya, because all Narakas, all Devas, some Tiryancha Panchendriyas, some Manusyas and Badara Vayukayikas have Vaikriya bodies. Compared to all Vaikriya bodies, Audarika bodies are innumerable times more in terms of dravya (in terms of the number of bodies), because Audarika bodies are found in all Pancha Sthavaras, three Vikalendriyas, Panchendriya Tiryanchas and Manusyas. And then, each of the Prithvi-Ap-Tej-Vayu-Vanaspatikayikas are innumerable Lokakasha-sized. Taijasa and Karmana bodies are equal in number, yet they are infinite times more in number than Audarika bodies, because after Audarika body holders, Vaikriya body holders also have Taijasa-Karmana bodies. And the subtle and Badara Nigoda Jivas are infinite, they have one Audarika body but their Taijasa-Karmana bodies are separate. If we consider from the perspective of pradesha (the pradeshas-paramanus of the body), then the Aharaka body is the smallest, because the pradeshas of the Aharaka body, which has the number Sahasra Prithaktva, are less than the pradeshas of all other bodies. Although the Aharaka vargana is less than the Vaikriya vargana in terms of paramanus, 1. (a) Prajnaapana, Malayavatti, Patra 433-434 / (b) Prajnaapana, Prameyaboधिनी टीका, Bha. 4, p. 822-823

"The Vaikriya bodies are said to be countless times greater than the Aharak bodies in terms of their regions, although they are infinite times greater than the Prajnapana Sutra. This is because the Aharak body is only the size of a hand, while the Vaikriya body, made up of many Varganas, can be as large as a hundred thousand yojanas. Secondly, the Aharak bodies are few in number, only a thousand in number, while the Vaikriya bodies are equal to the regions of countless Lokakashas. Therefore, the Vaikriya bodies are said to be countless times greater than the Aharak bodies in terms of their regions.

They are said to be countless times greater than the Audarik bodies in terms of their regions because they are found to be equal to the regions of countless Lokakashas, and therefore their regions are very abundant. They are infinitely greater than the Tejas bodies in terms of their regions because they are infinitely greater than the Audarik bodies in terms of their substance. The Karman bodies are infinitely greater than the Tejas bodies in terms of their regions because the Karman Varganas are infinitely greater than the Tejas Varganas in terms of the number of atoms.

Considering both substance and region, the Aharak bodies are the smallest in terms of substance, the Vaikriya bodies are countless times greater in terms of substance, and the Audarik bodies are countless times greater than them in terms of substance. The same logic applies here. In terms of substance, the Audarik bodies are infinitely greater than the Aharak bodies in terms of region, because all the Audarik bodies together are equal to the regions of countless Lokakashas, while each Aharak body-worthy Vargana has an infinite number of atoms from the Abhavyas.

They are also countless times greater than the Vaikriya bodies in terms of their regions. They are also countless times greater than the Audarik bodies in terms of their regions. The logic in this matter is the same as before. They are also infinitely greater than the Tejas and Karman bodies in terms of substance, because they are very abundant and have an infinite number. They are also infinitely greater than the Tejas bodies in terms of their regions, because each Tejas body is produced from an infinite number of Varganas containing an infinite number of atoms. They are also infinitely greater than the Karman bodies in terms of their regions. The logic in this matter should be understood as before."

[478] [From the Prajñapanasūtra Dhāt, when the samvahata jīvas exit their previous body and the dimensions (height), bāhalya (thickness), and vistāra (width) of their taijasa body are considered, in that situation, the region where those jīvas will be born is filled with the measure of countless parts of an angula, which is the measure of the audārika body's avagahana. And the very small space in between is also filled. / Therefore, the audārika's jghanya avagahana is especially greater than the taijasa-karmāṇa body's jghanya avagahana. The jghanya avagahana of the āhārika body is the measure of a hand, and the utkrishta avagahana is also the measure of one hand. / The audārika body's utkrishta avagahana is many times greater than that, because it is the measure of 1001 yojanas. The utkrishta avagahana of the vaikriya body is the measure of 100,001 yojanas, making it many times greater than that. / Even though the utkrishta avagahana of the taijasa-karmāṇa body is the same, the utkrishta avagahana of the vaikriya body is countless times greater, because it is the measure of 14 rajjūs. / The rest is clear. /] // The twenty-first avagahana-samsthāna-pada of the Prajñapana Bhagavati is complete. // 48.

**Twenty-second Kriyapada:** This is the twenty-second Kriyapada of the Prajñapanasutra. It presents profound contemplation on the relationship between actions from various perspectives. 

* The concept of action has been prevalent among ancient Indian philosophers. There were thinkers who did not believe in any karmic veil separate from action. Their knowledge was called Vibhangajñāna. 

* In India, since ancient times, 'karma' - meaning desires or impressions - has been considered the cause of rebirth. Contemplation on karma was essential along with the concept of the soul's birth and rebirth or the cycle of existence. However, this contemplation is rarely found in the ancient Upanishads, while it is extensively found in Jain and Buddhist literature, especially in the Jain Agamas.

* The Kriyavicara of the present Prajñapanasutra is a collection of contemplations on various aspects of action. Here, the order of Kriyavicara is as follows:

* Firstly, the five divisions and subdivisions of action, namely kāyiko, etc., are explained, focusing only on the concept of violence and non-violence.

* Subsequently, action is considered as the cause of karma-bandha, and questions are raised regarding the activity and inactivity of beings. Inactivity, meaning completely devoid of actions, is considered completely liberated from karma, the ultimate and supreme state.

* After that, the actions (karma in a different sense) arising from the eighteen pāpa-sthānas and their objects are described. Therefore, the binding of seven or eight karmas due to the determination of prāṇātipāta, etc., is mentioned.

* Then, the contemplation is presented on how many actions occur when a being binds karma like jñānāvaraniya, etc. Here, the actions of the 18 pāpa-sthānas are not considered, but only the aforementioned five.

Page #1068:
---------------------------
[480] The actions in the *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* are kept in mind, but the commentator has explained that the intention of these questions is that when a being binds karma through *prāṇātipāta*, how many actions are involved in the termination of that *prāṇātipāta*. The commentator has also clarified that one should understand three, four, or five actions in the order of *kāyikī* etc. Subsequently, how many actions does a being have in relation to one or many beings, and how many actions does a being have in relation to one or many beings in terms of *kāyikī* etc.? How do *kāyikī* etc. actions appear to another being? The commentator explains this as follows: Only the *kāyikī* etc. actions that occur in the present birth are not intended here, but the actions performed by other beings from the body etc. in past births are also intended here, because the being who did not accept the cessation of the past body etc., or who did not reject the body etc. (*vyutsarga* or *mamatvatyāga*), will be responsible for whatever is created from that body etc., or whatever actions other beings will perform through it, because he did not renounce the attachment to the body etc. *After this, the attainment of all five actions in the beings of the twenty-four *daṇḍakas* is described. After this, the co-existence of the five actions of *kāyikī* etc. in the twenty-four *daṇḍakas* is discussed. Along with this, the co-existence of the five actions of *kāyikī* etc. is discussed by describing them as *prāyojikā* (connecting to the cycle of existence). *After this, the discussion of being present or absent in the five actions in relation to one being in one being is discussed. *After this, by classifying the actions in different ways, five types of *prāramhbhikī* etc. are described, and which action is found in which being? This is mentioned. After this, the same actions are described in the twenty-four *daṇḍakas*. Then the co-existence of these five actions in beings is discussed. *Finally, the co-existence of these actions is discussed in relation to time, country, and region. *After this, the discussion is about which being can abstain from the eighteen *pāpasthānas* from *prāṇātipāta* to *mithyādarśanaśalya*, and in what context does abstinence from *prāṇātipāta* etc. occur? etc. 1. *Paṇṇavaṇāmuttam Mūlapāṭhaṭippanā*, pp. 351-352 2.

[Twenty-first Avagahaanasthana] [481 * This discussion has been done in singular and plural forms, how many karma-prakritis can a being who is free from the 18 papasthanas like pranatipat etc. bind? It has explained many bhangas (alternatives) of binding. * Thereafter, this discussion has been presented that which of the five actions are present in a common being who is free from the papasthanas like pranatipat etc. or in which being of the twenty-four dandakas? * And finally, the alpabahutva of the five actions like aarambhiki etc. has been explained. * The basis of this alpabahutva is which action belongs to fewer or more beings? The first mithyadarshan pratyaya kriya is of mithyadrishti, while the apratyakhyanakriya is of both avirat samyagdristi and mithyadrishti. In the same way, the further actions have been explained in increasing order. * From this entire kriyavivarana, it is clear that the five actions like kayiki etc., the actions arising from the 18 papasthanas, and the five actions like aarambhiki etc., are obstacles in the self-development of every being, their abandonment is necessary to make the soul free and independent. It is clearly explained in Bhagavati Sutra, as long as there is pramad and yoga in a Shraman, the kriya continues. As long as there is kriya, there is no liberation. * But in this entire kriyavivarana, the two divisions of kriya, iryapathik and samparayik, which became prevalent later, have not been given a place. * This indicates the antiquity of this kriyavichar. In addition, the 25 kriyas mentioned in the Stanangasutra or the 13 kriyasthana mentioned in the Sutrakrutanga are included in the 18 papasthanajan kriyas mentioned in the kriyapada of prajnapan. * Some are included in the 5 like kayiki etc. and some in the 5 like aarambhiki etc. * * D 1.

**[483] Gotama! How many types of *Paritaapanika* actions are there?**

**[Answer] Gotama! There are three types.**

**Just as, by which action, pain is caused to oneself, to others, or to both oneself and others, that is *Paritaapanika* action.**

**[1571]**

**[1572] Bhagavan! How many types of *Praanaatipaata* actions are there?**

**[Answer] Gotama! There are three types.**

**Just as, by which action, oneself, others, or both oneself and others are deprived of life, that is *Praanaatipaata* action.**

**[1572]**

**Discussion:**

The distinction between actions, based on the concept of violence and non-violence, is presented in these six sutras (from 1567 to 1572). The five basic types of actions and their sub-types are explained in these sutras.

**Specific meaning of actions:**

**Action** has two meanings:

1. To do.
2. Effort that is the cause of karma-bondage.

**Types of actions:**

* **Kaayika:** Actions performed by the body.
* **Adhikaaranika:** Actions performed by means of instruments of violence, such as swords, wheels, etc., which lead to the soul being bound to hell and other unfortunate realms.
* **Praadveshika:** Actions performed out of hatred, envy, and other negative emotions, which are the cause of karma-bondage.
* **Paritaapanika:** Actions that cause pain or suffering.
* **Praanaatipaatika:** Actions that cause the destruction of any of the ten vital energies (including the senses).

**Anupara-kaayika:** Actions that are not completely refrained from, either in terms of place or time. This action applies to those who are not completely restrained.

**Dus-pra-yukta-kaayika:** Actions that involve the misuse of the body and other faculties. This action applies to those who are careless and not fully controlled, as they are prone to misuse their body.

**Sanyojana-adhikaaranika:** Actions that involve the use of instruments of violence, such as weapons, poison, etc., which have been prepared beforehand. This action applies to those who use such instruments.

**Nivartana-adhikaaranika:** Actions that involve the creation of instruments of violence, such as swords, spears, etc., from their raw materials. This action applies to those who create such instruments.

##  Translation:

**484] [Prajapana Sutra Pranatipatakriya - To commit suicide in any way, or to kill others or both out of hatred, this is the threefold Pranatipatakriya.  _ Paritapaniki Kriya:  Doubt Resolution -  Any austerity or other ritual that is impossible, which causes mental distress, loss of senses, or leads to the mind, speech, and body going astray or becoming completely weak, is considered Paritapaniki Kriya. However, if it does not cause harm, results in self-benefit, creates a desire to destroy karma, and fosters elevated feelings, then it is not Paritapaniki Kriya.  **

**The Nature of Active and Inactive Beings 1573. [Question]  Bhagavan! Are beings active or inactive (without action)? [Answer]  Gautama! Beings are both active (with action) and inactive (without action). [Question]  Bhagavan! Why is it said that beings are both active and inactive? [Answer]  Gautama! Beings are said to be of two types:  Samsarasamavashnaga and Asamsarasamavashnaga.  Of these, those who are Asamsarasamavashnaga are Siddhas (liberated beings). Siddhas (liberated beings) are inactive (without action).  And of those who are Samsarasamavashnaga, they are also of two types:  Saileeshipradivannaga and PraSaileeshipradivannaga.  Of these, those who are Saileeshipradivannaga are inactive, and those who are PraSaileeshipradivannaga are active.  Therefore, Gautama! It is said that beings are both active and inactive.  1.

[488] The *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* (sūtras 1574 to 1580) describes the actions and their respective subjects that arise from the *adhyavasaya* (determination) of *prāṇātipāta* (violence) to *mithyādarśanaśalya* (false belief). The *prāṇātipāta* action: cause and subject - sūtra 1574 The meaning of the previous question is: the *prāṇātipāta* action is performed, i.e., happens, from the *adhyavasaya* of *prāṇātipāta*, i.e., violence. Its implication is that the *prāṇātipāta* action takes place at the time of the culmination (result of *adhyavasaya*) of *prāṇātipāta* (violence). This statement is made from the perspective of the *ṛjusūtranaya*. Every action happens according to the *adhyavasaya*. Because the acquisition and non-acquisition of *puṇya* (merit) and *pāpakarma* (demerit) depends on the *adhyavasaya*. Therefore, the Lord has also answered all these questions from the perspective of the *ṛjusūtranaya* that the *prāṇātipāta* action happens from the *adhyavasaya* of *prāṇātipāta*. There is a similar *āgama* statement: "**parināmiyam paṃāṇaṃ nicchayam avalambaṃāṇāṃ**". Based on this statement, it is also said in the *Āvaśyaka Sūtra*: "**āyā ceva ahiṃsā, prāya hiṃsatti nicchayo es'**" (The soul is non-violence, the soul is violence, this is the statement of the *naya*). The conclusion is that the *prāṇātipāta* action happens from the *adhyavasaya* of *prāṇātipāta*. Similarly, it should be understood that the actions of *mṛṣāvāda* etc. happen from the *adhyavasaya* of the remaining 17 *pāpastānaka* (negative karmas). The second question within the present sūtra is: in what subject does the *prāṇātipāta* action happen? In other words, what is the subject of the *adhyavasaya* that is the cause of the *prāṇātipāta* action? In response, the subject of the *adhyavasaya* that is the cause of the *prāṇātipāta* action is said to be the *ṣaṭjīvanikāya* (six categories of living beings). Because the *adhyavasaya* to kill is related to living beings, not non-living beings. The *adhyavasaya* to kill that arises from the understanding of a rope etc. as a snake is also related to living beings because it is motivated by the understanding "this is a snake". Therefore, it is said that the *prāṇātipāta* action happens in the *ṣaṭjīvanikāya*. Similarly, it should be understood from the original text that the actions of *mṛṣāvāda* etc. that happen from the *adhyavasaya* of the remaining 17 *pāpastānaka* happen with respect to different subjects. *Mṛṣāvāda*: nature and subject - Speaking untruth and representing the non-existent as existent is *mṛṣāvāda*. The *adhyavasaya* of *mṛṣāvāda* can be related to all objects in the world and beyond. Therefore, it is said: "**sabvadanvesu sarvadravyāṃ ke viṣaye mṛṣāvāda kriyā kā kāraṇabhūt adhyavasaya hotā hai.**" From the indication of the acceptance of the object, it should also be understood with respect to "all synonyms". The subject of the action of *adattādāna* etc. can only be the object that can be accepted or possessed. Therefore, the *adattādāna* action is not related to other objects. Therefore, it is said: "**gahaṇadhāraṇijjesu davvesu.**" The *adhyavasaya* of *maithuna* (sexual intercourse) is also related to the forms of pictures, wood, walls, statues, puppets etc. or to women etc. associated with those forms. The meaning of *parigraha* (attachment) is the desire for ownership or possession. It can be related to all objects due to greed that resides within beings. Therefore, it is said: "**savvadamvesu.**" The meaning and subject of *abhyākhyāna* etc. - *abhyākhyāna* - accusing someone with false faults; 1. *Prajñāpanā*, *mala-pravṛtti*, page 437-438 2.

[1583-2] In the same way (according to the statement of the aforementioned sūtra), from Asurakumāra to Stanitakumāra (one should understand the three-three bhangas of karma-prakriti-bandha caused by the determination of prāṇātipāta). [3] Pṛthvī-ap-tejo-vāyu-vanaspatikāyika jīvas, all these are like the audhika (general-many) jīvas (Su. 1582) / [1583-3] (karma-prakriti-bandha caused by prāṇātipāta) in the case of earth-water-fire-air-plant-bodied jīvas (as mentioned in Su. 1582) (karma-prakriti-bandha) should be said to be the same. [4] The rest are like the Nairyikas / [1583-4] The remaining jīvas (up to the Vaimānikas, in the matter of karma-prakriti-bandha caused by prāṇātipāta) should be said to be like the Nairyikas. 1584.

[1584-1] In this way, leaving aside the collective jīvas and the one-sensed ones (for each of the remaining daṇḍakas), three-three bhangas should be said everywhere / and (from mṛṣāvāda to) mithyādarśanaśalya (determinations) (one should also state the karma-bandha caused by them /).

Discussion-The presentation of the form of karma-bandha caused by prāṇātipāta etc.-In the present four sūtras (from 1581 to 1584), the form of karma-prakriti-bandha caused by the determination of prāṇātipāta etc., which is the cause of prāṇātipāta etc. actions, has been presented. When are the seven-fold bandha and the eight-fold bandha? When does a jīva do the seven-fold bandha or the eight-fold karma-bandha? The reason for this is that when there is no prāyuṣya karma-bandha, then there is bandha of seven karma-prakritis, and in the time of āyuṣyakarma-bandha, there is bandha of eight karma-prakritis. This has been considered from the point of view of ekattva. When considered from the point of view of pṛthaktva, many ordinary jīvas are either found to be seven-fold bandhakas or eight-fold bandhakas / these are always found in greater numbers in both places / In the Nairyika sūtra, there are seven-fold bandhakas; because narakas, which are full of the results of violence etc., are always available in large numbers. Therefore, there is no doubt about their being seven-fold bandhakas. When there is not even one āyuṣya bandhaka, then all are seven-fold bandhakas. When there is one prāyuṣka bandhaka, then the rest are all seven-fold bandhakas / When many eight-fold bandhakas are found, then there is a plural form in both. That is, many seven-fold bandhakas and many eight-fold bandhakas / In this way, from three bhangas...

The twenty-second action should be described as follows: [491] The statement should be made up to ten types of Bhavanapati, starting with Asurakumara. The five stationary beings, starting with Prithvikaayika, are often the result of violence, therefore they are found in many forms and they are either seven-fold or eight-fold bound. The remaining two-three-four-sensory, Tiryanchpanchendriya, human, Vanavyantara, Jyotishka and Vaimaniyaka should be described like the Nairyika with the Bhangatrika. [1] There are 36 Dandaka for 18 Papasthanaka, because each of the 18 Papasthanaka, from Pranatipat to Mithyadarshan Shalya, has two Dandaka due to the difference between the oneness and separateness of the 18 Papasthanaka. [1585] [1] O Gautama! How many actions are there when a being binds the Jnanavaranijja Karma? [Ans.] Gautama! It may be three actions, it may be four actions, or it may be five actions. [1585-1] [2] Similarly, from a Nairyika to a Vaimaniyaka. [1585-2] [1486] [1] O Gautama! How many actions are there when beings bind the Panavaranijja Karma? [Ans.] Gautama! It may be three actions, it may be four actions, or it may be five actions. [1586-1] [2] Similarly, from a Nairyika to a Vaimaniyaka. [1586-2] [1587] [1] Similarly, the Darisanavaranijja, Beyanijja, Mohanija, Avyam, Naam, Go, Antarai, and the eight-fold Karma-Pagdiya should be described. 1. Prajnaapana Malaya Vritti Patra 440 2.

[492] [From the Prajñāpanā [1587-1] In the same way as the Jñānāvaraṇīya karma, the Darshanāvaraṇīya, Vedaniya, Mohaniya, Prāyuṣya, Nāma, Gotra and Antarāyika, these eight types of karma-prakr̥tis (should be called the nourishers of the actions that bind a single jīva or a single nairyāyika up to the Vaimānika, or that bind many jīvas or many nairyāyikas up to the Vaimānikas.) [2] Egatt-pohattiya solas danda-ga. [1587-2] There are sixteen danda-kas (of the supporting group) of unity and separateness / The discussion in this three-sūtra (sū. 1585 to 1587) presenting the form of actions dependent on the eight types of karma-bandha, describes the form of the number of actions that bind jīvas due to prāṇātipāta etc. and cause the binding of Jñānāvaraṇīya etc. karma. The meaning of the present question - It was said earlier in this verse that a jīva binds seven or eight karmas due to the determination of prāṇātipāta etc. sin. Here it is explained that how many actions does he perform while binding Jñānāvaraṇīya etc. karma, starting from kāyikī etc.? And here the difference in the cessation of the cause called prāṇātipāta from the effect called Jñānāvaraṇīya karma is also explained. From that difference, a particular type of binding is also revealed / It is also said - "Violence is ended (completed) by three, four or five actions respectively, but if there is equality of yoga and pradveṣa, then there is a specific binding / The meaning of the answer - While explaining the difference in the cessation of the same prāṇātipāta, it is said in the answer that perhaps it is of three actions, etc. When it is of three actions, then it ends prāṇātipāta by the kāyikī, prādhīkaranikī and prādvēṣikī actions. By kāyikī, he uses his hands, feet etc. (activity or business), by prādhīkaranikī, he gathers or sharpens a sword etc., and by prādvēṣikī, he has an evil conception (thought) in his mind like 'I will kill him' / When it is of four actions, then in addition to the kāyikī, grādhīkaranikī, prādvēṣikī actions, it also becomes associated with the fourth 'pārītāpanikī' action, i.e. it also becomes associated with the pārītāpanikī action by inflicting pain through the striking (hitting) of a sword etc. When it is of five actions, then in addition to the aforementioned four actions, it also becomes associated with the fifth prāṇātipātikī action. That is, it also becomes associated with the prāṇātipāta action by depriving him of life. 'Tikiriye' etc. words mean - Jīvas are always many while binding the Jñānāvaraṇīya karma, therefore there are also those who have three actions, those who have four actions and those who have five actions. In this way, the discussion of actions has been done taking one jīva, one nairyāyika etc., and many jīvas or many nairyāyika etc. twenty-four danda-ka-vrtti jīvas. 1. Prajñāpanā.

Therefore, whatever is created from those śarīra etc. or whatever is used to inflict pain on someone or to harm someone, that is, whatever action is performed by another being with the śarīra etc. of the past, the former owner of that śarīra etc. is responsible for it, because that being did not abandon its ownership of the śarīra etc.; it did not abandon the mamatva towards it. As long as the being does not abandon the former śarīra etc., the actions related to it continue. However, if the being abandons the mamatva of the body of the previous birth, then no action is attributed to it, because it has completely withdrawn from it. Explanation - The actions (3, 4 or 5) that are attributed to a being with respect to another being are attributed to the present life. The actions of kāyikī etc. are attributed to a being with respect to the past life in the following way: kāyikī is attributed when the body or a part of the body related to its previous birth is used. Prādhikāraṇikī is attributed when the instruments like plough, pestle, sword etc. connected to the body of its previous birth are used to harm others. Prādvēṣikī is attributed when the mamatva of the śarīra etc. of the previous birth is not abandoned, and someone is inclined towards the bad consequences related to it. Pārītāpanikī occurs when someone is inflicting pain (santapa) on others with the unabandoned kāya or a part of the kāya. And prāṇātipātakriyā occurs when the death of another is caused by that unabandoned kāya. Akriya is when a person abandons the body of the previous birth or the means connected to the body with the three karana and three yoga. Then he does not perform or cause any action with that birth-born body. This akriyata should be understood with respect to humans, because only humans can become sarvavirat. The death of gods and narakas is impossible, because gods and narakas have an unchangeable (nirupakrama) lifespan. Their untimely death never occurs. Therefore, the fifth action cannot occur in their case. With respect to dvīndriyādi etc., the actions of kāyikī etc. are attributed to the naraka in the following way: as long as the naraka does not abandon the body of the previous birth, the body of that naraka is called 'his' according to the prajñāpanā of the previous birth, like an empty ghee pot. If someone else causes the death of another with a part of that body, like a bone etc., then the owner of that body in the previous birth is also involved in the actions of kāyikī etc., because he did not abandon that body. When someone knows that a part of the body of the same being is capable of inflicting harm (prahara) etc., then (k) Paṇṇavaṇāsutam (introduction etc.) Bha. 2 p. 123 1.

## 504] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra: Actions that are the cause of the cycle of birth and death are called "prāyojita" actions. Although actions are directly the cause of karma-bandha, they are also traditionally considered the cause of the cycle of birth and death. This is because karma-bandha, such as jñānāvaraṇīya, is the cause of the cycle of birth and death. Therefore, these actions are also considered the cause of the cycle of birth and death, either directly or traditionally.

**Discussion on the concept of "spṛṣṭa" (touched) and "aspṛṣṭa" (untouched) in relation to actions:**

**1620] Bhagavan!** At the time when a being is touched by kāyika, prādhikāraṇika, and prādeśika actions, is it also touched by pārītāpanika actions, or by prāṇātipātika actions?

**Gautama!** (1) A being, in comparison to another being, at the time when it is touched by kāyika, prādhikāraṇika, and prādeśika actions, is also touched by pārītāpanika actions and prāṇātipātika actions.

(2) A being, in comparison to another being, at the time when it is touched by kāyika, prādhikāraṇika, and prādeśika actions, is also touched by pārītāpanika actions, but not by prāṇātipātika actions.

(3) A being, in comparison to another being, at the time when it is touched by kāyika, prādhikāraṇika, and prādeśika actions, is not touched by pārītāpanika actions and not by prāṇātipātika actions.

(4) A being, in comparison to another being, at the time when it is not touched by kāyika, prādhikāraṇika, and prādeśika actions, is also not touched by pārītāpanika actions and not by prāṇātipātika actions.

**Discussion:** This fourfold classification of "spṛṣṭa" and "aspṛṣṭa" in relation to actions presents a consideration of how many of the five actions are "spṛṣṭa" and how many are "aspṛṣṭa" in a single being at a single time.

**The Beginning of the Prajñapanasutra**

The five initial actions are defined as follows:

* **Ārambhikī:** The suppression of earth, water, fire, etc., with intention and consciousness is called Ārambhikī.
* **Before Ārambhikī, there are two stages:**
    * **Samarabh:** This refers to the intention (sankalpa).
    * **Samārabh:** This refers to the action of suffering (paritāpa).
* **The action that has Ārambhikī as its purpose or cause is called Ārambhikī.**
* **Pārigrahikī:** Accepting objects and clinging to them, except for the objects of Dharma and the objects of the world (parigrahikī-dharmopakarana).
* **Pārigrahikī:** This is the result of Pārigraha.
* **Māyāpratyayā:** Deception, deceit, and lack of honesty.
* **Māyāpratyayā:** This is the action whose cause is Māyā.
* **Apratyaakhyāna:** This refers to the renunciation of the bonds of attachment, such as violence, rules, etc.
* **Apratyaakhyāna:** This is the absence of the results of renunciation or abandonment.
* **Apratyaakhyāna-kriyā:** This is the action that arises from Apatyaakhyāna.
* **Mithyādarśanapratyayā:** This is the action whose cause is wrong belief (mithyādarśana) or contrary faith (viparīta śraddhā).

**Who is the owner or possessor of each of these actions?** This is explained in sūtras 1622 to 1626.

* **Ārambhikī:** This action occurs in those who are careless (pramatta-samyata) when they suppress earth, etc., due to carelessness and misuse of the body (kāya-duṣprayoga).
* **Pārigrahikī:** This action occurs in those who are detached from the world (deśa-virata) because they hold onto possessions (parigraha).
* **Apratyaakhyānī:** This action does not occur in everyone, but only in those who do not renounce anything.
* **Mithyādarśanapratyayā:** This action occurs in those who are disrespectful, unfaithful, and disobedient towards gods, gurus, dharma, and scriptures.

**The Classification of Actions in the Twenty-Four Danda**

**1627. [1] Raīyāṇam bhanta! Kati kiriyāpro paṇṇattāyo? Goyamā! Pañca kiriyāpro paṇṇattāo. Tam jahā-ārambhiyā jāv micchādasaṇavattiyā. [1627-1 pra.] Bhagavan!

[2] Evam jāv bemāṇiāṇam / [1627-2] In the same way (as the Nairyika) up to the Vaimānika (one should understand five actions in each /).**

**Discussion:** This sūtra (1627) presents the classification of the five actions, Ārambhikī, etc., in the twenty-four Danda-bound beings.

**1628. Jassa gam bhanta! Jīvassa ārambhiyā kiriyā kajjati tassa pārigghiyā kiriyā kajjati? Jassa pārigghiyā kiriyā kajjai tassa ārambhiyā kiriyā kajjati?**

**[518]** The *Prajñāpanasūtra* and the *Mithyādarśanapratyayā* actions do not apply because a being or human who abstains from *prāṇātipāta* (violence) abstains from everything. Therefore, they only take the *Mahāvrata* (great vows) with *samyaktva* (right faith), reject violence and other harmful actions, and also take the *Aparigraha Mahāvrata* (vow of non-possession). Therefore, the *Mithyādarśanapratyayā*, *Apratyaख्यानप्रत्यया*, and *Pārigrahika* actions do not apply to them. The *Prāṇātipātavirata* (abstaining from violence) and *Pramattasanyata* (careless restraint) have initial actions, but the rest of the *Sarvavirata* (abstaining from everything) do not. The *Apratmattasanyata* (careful restraint) may have *Māyāpratyayā* actions for the protection of the *Pravachanamālinya* (the purity of the teachings) on occasion, but not at other times. The same *Mithyādarśanasalyavirata* (free from the poison of false belief) being has initial actions if they are *Pramattasanyata*. The *Pārigrahika* actions are only up to *Deśavirata* (abstaining from the land), not beyond. The *Māyāpratyayā* also only occur up to *Anivṛtta Bādarasamprayā* (the state of not returning to the cycle of birth and death), not beyond. The *Apratyaख्यान* actions also only occur up to *Aviratasamyagdṛṣṭi* (unwavering right faith), not beyond. Therefore, there is a choice-indicating pattern for these actions in relation to the *Mithyādarśanasalyavirata*. The *Mithyādarśanapratyayā* action is completely impossible for the *Mithyādarśanavirata* (free from false belief). Further, the twenty-four *Daṇḍaka* (punishments) are considered. There are four actions from the *Nairyika* (non-human) to the *Stanitakumāra* (a type of celestial being) for the *Mithyādarśanavirata*, but no *Mithyādarśanapratyayā*. In the *Tiryac-pañcendriya* (animals with five senses), the first three actions occur by rule, the *Apratyaख्यान* action occurs by choice, and it does not occur for those who are *Deśavirata*, but it does for the rest. The *Mithyādarśanapratyayā* does not occur. In humans, the actions should be understood as being the same as those of ordinary beings, and in the *Vyantara* and other gods, they should be understood as being the same as those of the *Nārakas* (hell beings).

**[1663]** "Sir, among these initial actions up to the *Mithyādarśanapratyayā*, which are less, which are more, which are equal, or which are special?" [Answer] "Gautama, the *Mithyādarśanapratyayā* actions are the least. The *Apratyaख्यान* actions are more special than them. The *Pārigrahika* actions are more special than them. The initial actions are more special than them, and the *Māyāpratyayā* actions are more special than all of them."

**[1663]** "The Blessed One, the twenty-second *Kiriyāpaya* (chapter on actions) is complete."

[Twenty-second Verb] [519 Discussion-Actions are Few: Why and How? —The least number of *mithyadarshan* (false belief) actions are because they are only of the *mithyadrishtis* (those with false belief). *Apratyaakhyan* (non-rejection) actions are more prevalent because they are of both the *avirata samyagdrisht* (those with unwavering right belief) and the *mithyadrishtis*. *Parigrahiki* (attachment) actions are more prevalent because they are also of the *deshavirata* (those who have renounced the world) and those of the previous category. *Prarambhiki* (initial) actions are more prevalent because they are of the *pramattasanyata* (those who are restrained by negligence) and those of the previous *gunasthanas* (stages of spiritual progress). *Maya* (illusion) actions are more prevalent because they are found in the *apramattasanyata* (those who are restrained by non-negligence) after all other worldly beings.  /  /  *Prajnaapana* (Declaration) of Bhagavati's Twenty-second Verb is Complete  /  1. *Prajnaapana*. *Malayavritti*, Letter 452

##  Anadhyayakala [Quoted from Nandī Sūtra edited by Acharya Shri Atmaramji Maharaj]

One should study scriptures only during the time prescribed in the Agamas for study.  Studying during the Anadhyayakala is prohibited.  The Manusmriti and other Smritis also describe Anadhyayakala in detail.  The Vedic people also mention the Anadhyayas of the Vedas.  Similarly, other Ārya texts are also considered Anadhyaya.  Since the Jain Agamas are also Sarvajñokta, Devadhiṣṭhita, and Svaravidyā, their Anadhyayakala is also described in the Agamas.  For example, the ten types of celestial phenomena that are considered Anadhyaya are:

1. Ukkavāte (meteor shower)
2. Disidāghe (fire in the sky)
3. Gajjite (thunder)
4. Vijjute (lightning)
5. Nigghāte (earthquake)
6. Juvate (windstorm)
7. Jakkhālitte (eclipse)
8. Dhūmita (smoke)
9. Mahita (fog)
10. Rayugghaate (flood)

The ten types of bodily conditions that are considered Anadhyaya are:

1. Aṭṭhī (bone disease)
2. Mansaṁ (flesh disease)
3. Soṇite (blood disease)
4. Asūtisāmante (death of a relative)
5. Susāṇasāmante (visiting a cemetery)
6. Candovārāte (full moon)
7. Sūrovārāte (new moon)
8. Paḍne (falling)
9. Rāyavugghe (loss of wealth)
10. Uvassayassa anto bhorālie sarīrage (death of a Jain monk)

- **Stāṇāṅga Sūtra, Stāna 10**

It is not appropriate for a Niggantha or a Nigganthī to study during the four Mahāpāḍivās:

1. Prāsāḍhapāḍivā
2. Indamahāpāḍivā
3. Katṭapāḍivā
4. Sugimhapāḍivā

It is not appropriate for a Niggantha or a Nigganthī to study during the four Saṁjhās:

1. Paḍimāte (evening)
2. Pacchimāte (night)
3. Majjhaṇhe (noon)
4. Aḍḍharatte (midnight)

It is appropriate for a Niggantha or a Nigganthī to study during the four Kālas:

1. Punvaṇhe (morning)
2. Avaraṇhe (afternoon)
3. Pose (early morning)
4. Pacchūse (late evening)

- **Stāṇāṅga Sūtra, Stāna 4, Uddesa 2**

According to the above Sūtra text, there are thirty-two Anadhyayas: ten related to celestial phenomena, ten related to bodily conditions, four Mahāpāḍivās, four Mahāpāḍivā Purnimās, and four Saṁjhās.  These are briefly described below:

**Celestial Phenomena:**

1. **Ukkavāte (Meteor Shower):** If there is a large meteor shower, one should not study for one prahara.
2. **Disidāghe (Fire in the Sky):** One should not study as long as the sky appears red, as if it is on fire.
3. **Gajjite (Thunder):** One should not study for two praharas after thunder.
4. **Vijjute (Lightning):** One should not study for one prahara after lightning. However, the prohibition on studying during thunder and lightning does not apply during Cāturmās.

Page #1109:
---------------------------
##  Anadhyaya Kaal 

**521. Thunder and lightning are generally due to the nature of the season. Therefore, from Prati to Swati Nakshatra, it is not considered Anadhyaya.**

**5. When there is a loud thunder in the sky without clouds, or when there is thunder with clouds, it is Anadhyaya for two Praharas.**

**6. Yupaka - In the Shukla Paksha, the first, second, and third days, the meeting of the evening glow and the moonlight is called Yupaka. On these days, one should not study from Prahara to night.**

**7. Yakshadeepta - Sometimes, a light appears in a direction, like lightning, which appears intermittently. This is called Yakshadeepta. Therefore, one should not study as long as the Yaksha-like light is visible.**

**8. Dhumika - From Krishna-Katik to Magh, the time is the womb month of clouds. During this time, a fine, water-like mist of smoky color falls. This is called Dhumika-Krishna. One should not study as long as this mist falls.**

**9. Mihika Shweta - In winter, a fine, water-like mist of white color falls, called Mihika. One should not study as long as this falls.**

**10. Raj-Udghāt - Due to the wind, dust spreads all over the sky. One should not study as long as this dust remains spread.**

**The above ten reasons are related to the sky and are considered Anadhyaya.**

**11.12.13. Audarik (Body) related Anadhyaya**

**Bones, Flesh, and Blood - If the bones, flesh, and blood of a Panchaindriya Tiryanch are visible, it is Anadhyaya until these things are removed from there. Vattikar considers it Anadhyaya for 60 hands around the place where these things are present. Similarly, Anadhyaya is considered for bones, flesh, and blood related to humans. The difference is that Anadhyaya for these lasts for 100 hands and one day and night.**

**Menstruation - Anadhyaya for a woman's menstruation lasts for three days.**

**Birth of a Child - Anadhyaya for the birth of a boy and a girl is considered for seven and eight days respectively.**

**14. Impurity - Anadhyaya lasts until the feces and urine are visible.**

**15. Cremation Ground - Anadhyaya is considered for 100 hands around the cremation ground.**

**16. Lunar Eclipse - During a lunar eclipse, one should not study for eight Praharas for the lowest level of study, twelve Praharas for the medium level, and sixteen Praharas for the highest level.**

**17. Solar Eclipse - During a solar eclipse, Anadhyaya is considered for eight, twelve, and sixteen Praharas respectively for the lowest, medium, and highest levels of study.**

---------------------------
##  Chapter 18:  Patan (Decline)

**522**  [18. Patan -  When a great king or national leader dies, one should not perform *svādhyāya* until their cremation is completed.  /  Or, one should perform *svādhyāya* gradually until another authority takes over. 16. Rājavyudgraha (Royal Conflict) - When there is a war between nearby kings, one should not perform *svādhyāya* until peace is restored, and for one day and night afterwards. 20. Audārika Śarīra (Noble Body) - When the five senses of a *bhātar* (Jain monk) are extinguished, one should not perform *svādhyāya* as long as the body remains, and for 100 *hātha* (cubits) if the lifeless body is lying there. These 10 reasons for not performing *svādhyāya* are related to the noble body. 21-28. Four Mahotsava (Great Festivals) and Four Mahāpratipadā (Great First Days) -  The four Mahotsava are: Āṣāḍha Pūrṇimā, Pāśvina Pūrṇimā, Kārttika Pūrṇimā, and Caitra Pūrṇimā. / The first day after these Pūrṇimā (full moon) days is called Mahāpratipadā.  *Svādhyāya* is prohibited during these days. 29-32. Prātaḥ (Morning), Sāyam (Evening), Madhyāhna (Midday), and Ardharātri (Midnight) - One should not perform *svādhyāya* one *ghaḍī* (hour) before and after sunrise, one *ghaḍī* before and after sunset, one *ghaḍī* before and after midday, and one *ghaḍī* before and after midnight. 00]

---------------------------
The revered Upadhyayaka, the treasure of austerity, Shri Sudarshan Muni, are not only an unparalleled source of Jain Agamas, philosophy, and spiritual enlightenment, but also an unparalleled repository of knowledge in various fields like geography, astronomy, civilization, culture, history, etc. In the present context, with the changing environment, there was a great need for authentic, concise, critical, and comparative analysis of the Agamas. This important need has been fulfilled by the learned scholar, the supreme expert in Jain principles, the great ascetic, the late Yuvacharya Shri Madhukar Muni Maharaj. The society will forever be indebted to him for this great contribution. This work will forever keep his memory alive as a monument to his glory. We are extremely delighted to express our heartfelt congratulations to him for this great service. The contribution of the noble souls who have cooperated in this sacred work with their body, mind, and wealth is also commendable. We are very happy to see the beautiful, clear, and durable Agam texts published by the Shri Agam Prakashan Samiti in a short time. With our best wishes to the Samiti, we hope that the remaining Agamas will be available for reading soon.

The third part of the fourth Upanga, *Prajnapana Sutra*, is being presented to the enlightened readers. This part contains verses 23 to 36 and marks the end of this Sutra. *Bhagavati Sutra* has also been fully printed. Both these Agamas are voluminous and their printing has reduced a great burden. This is a matter of great joy. This final part of *Prajnapana* includes a detailed introduction and appendix, which cover the entire text. These will be particularly useful for the readers. Like the previous two parts, its editor and translator is Jainbhushan, learned scholar Shri Gyanmuniji Maharaj, and the author of the introduction is Sahityavachaspati, Panditpravar Shri Devendramuniji Maharaj. The introduction is detailed. It contains the essence of the entire text. The committee is deeply grateful for the invaluable contribution of these Muniraj. *Anuyogadwar* is ready to be printed. Hopefully, it will also be presented to the readers as soon as possible. It is natural to express gratitude to all the scholars and financial contributors who have helped in the publication of this series of texts, whose valuable support has enabled the Agama publication work to move forward. Finally, it is requested that the Agama lovers and self-study enthusiasts contribute to the wider dissemination of these texts, so that the glory of Jainism may increase and our efforts may be more successful.

**Introduction to Prajnapana: A Critical Study**

India is a fertile land of spirituality. Every particle here resonates with the melodious music of spirituality. Every atom is filled with the sweet nectar of philosophy. This sacred and virtuous land has given birth to such human gems who were the embodiments of religion and spirituality. Every beat of their hearts was a beat of spirituality. Their vast and pure thoughts provided a clear and pure perspective to understand the living being and the world, the soul and the Supreme Soul, religion and philosophy.

Twenty-four Tirthankaras were born on this spiritually dominant, virtuous land. They did not desire to be reborn again and again like the avatars of the Vedic tradition to uplift the people. Nor was it acceptable to them to be reborn again and again through Bodhisattvas like the Tathagata Buddha to infuse a new consciousness in human life. They did not believe in avatarism, they preferred Uttarabhava (liberation).

In the Jain tradition, the Tirthankaras hold the highest position. In the Namaskara Maha Mantra, the Tirthankaras-Arihants are saluted before the Siddhas. The Tirthankaras are as radiant as the sun. "Pricchesv ahiyam payasayara." They illuminate the soul of the world with their rays of knowledge. They are the strong representatives of their era. Like the moon, they are gentle. They are the ultimate restorers of humanity. The Tirthankaras are direct perceivers, knowers, and self-reliant. They preach only after attaining Kevalgyan (omniscience) and Kevaldarshan (omniscience). Their teachings are based on experienced truth. Their teachings and system are not bound by any tradition.

In the present Avasarpini (descending) time, the first Tirthankara on this sacred land was Rishabhdev. After him, twenty-two Tirthankaras were born, and then the twenty-fourth Tirthankara, Bhagwan Mahavira, was born. All the Tirthankaras had their own independent traditions. And their rule was independent. At the time of Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira, there were thousands of Shramans following the tradition of Bhagwan Parshvanath. When they entered the Sangha of Mahavira, they had to abandon the Chaturyam Sadhana-Paddhati (fourfold practice) of Bhagwan Parshvanath and accept the Panch Mahavrata Sadhana-Paddhati (five great vows). This makes it clear that the great personality and achievements of each Tirthankara are not bound to the tradition of any particular Tirthankara, although the fundamental principles and philosophy are eternal, remaining the same in all three times, because truth is eternal.

The present Jain dispensation is related to the Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira. The functioning of Bhagwan Mahavira's Sangha was well-organized. His Sangha had eleven Ganadharas, nine Gan and seven Vyavasthapadas. All seven office-bearers had an unparalleled contribution in the education, initiation, etc. of the Sangha. The Acharya managed the Sangha. The Upadhyaya gave lectures on the Sutras. The Sthavir Shramans stabilized the Shramans in restraint-practice. The Pravartak, as designated by the Acharya, implemented the practices in the Sangha. The Gani skillfully led the group of small Shramans. The Ganadharas took care of the daily routine of the Shramans and managed the internal affairs of the Gan. In this way, all were engaged in the prosperity of the dispensation. There were many talented, brilliant, dominant, wise, and glorious Shramans in Bhagwan Mahavira's dispensation. Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira provided the Arthagam for the enlightenment of the Bhavyas. The Ganadharas, with their excellent talent, weaved that Arthagam into the form of Sutraagam. The Acharyas protected that Shruta-wealth even at the cost of their lives. The Upangas were created by taking the support of the Angagam-treasure composed by the Ganadharas. The fourth Upanga is called "Prajnapan". There is a detailed discussion about Prajna in Buddhist literature. The words 'Pan' and 'Panja' are used many times there. There is also a text called 'Pati' in Buddhist Pali literature, which describes the various types of Pudgal, i.e., the various types of men. The meaning of Panati, i.e., Prajnapti and Prajnapan, is similar there. Acharya Patanjali has mentioned Prajna in the Sutras like "Ritambhara Prajna" and "Tajjayatprajnalok". In the Bhagavad Gita, while discussing Sthitaprajna, the word "Tasy Prajna Pratiṣṭhitā" is used. The word 'Prajna' has been used in many places in Jain Agam literature. For example, the word 'Prajnan' is found in the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth Sutras of the second study of the Pracharang Sutra. In other places, in the Sutra Kritanga, while praising Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira, the words Prajna, Ashu Prajna, Bhuti Prajna, and in other places, the word "Mahaprajna" have been used. Bhagwan Mahavira has been called the inexhaustible source of Prajna. In the Uttaradhyayanasutra, the Keshi Kumar Shraman Ganadhar Gautam, of Bhagwan Parshvanath's lineage, asks, "O Medhavi! We have been engaged in the same purpose, then what is the reason for this (Prachar) difference? Do you not have any confusion in these two types of Dharma?" Gautam said, "The decision of Dharma Tattva should be made by Prajna."

Gautama's wisdom was repeatedly given *sadhvad*.4 It is clearly written in *Prachar* - the wisdom of a *samadhi*-dwelling *shraman* increases.15 *Prachar* *Yativrishabha* in his *Tiloyapannatti* text, while describing the attainments of 16 *shramans*, has given the name ' *Prajna* *shraman*' to one attainment. The *muni* who attains the *Prajna* *shraman* attainment becomes a thorough scholar of the entire *shruta*. Four types of *Prajna* *shraman* *ridhi* are described - *pautpattiki*, *parinamiki*, *vainayiki* and *karmaja*. The *Mantra* *raj* *rahasya* describes *Prajna* *shraman*.17 *Kalikalasarvjna* *Prachar* *Hemchandra* has explained *Prajna* *shraman*. *Acharya* *Vira* *sen* has paid homage to *Prajna* *shraman* and has also called them *Jin*. *Prachar* *Akalank* has also described *Prajna* *shraman*. 20 Now, it is worth pondering that the word *Prajna* is used in different places in different texts. Different lexicographers have called *Prajna* as *buddhi*. It is considered synonymous with *buddhi* and also has the same meaning! But on deep reflection, like the light of the sun, it becomes clear that the sameness of meaning of both words is only from a gross perspective. The words that lexicographers call synonyms are not actually synonyms. From the perspective of *samabhirudha* *naya*, no word is synonymous. Each word has its own distinct meaning. The word *Prajna* also has its own unique meaning. The word *buddhi* is related to the place and the physical world. But the word *Prajna* is far above *buddhi*. The word *buddhi* is used in the sense of external knowledge, while the *buddhi* of the inner world is *Prajna*. *Prajna* is the knowledge of the transcendental world. It is the light of inner consciousness. *Prajna* is not available through the study of any text. It is available through restraint and practice. We can divide *Prajna* into two parts - (1) *Indriyasambaddha* *Prajna* and (2) *Indriyatita* *Prajna*. *Acharya* *Vira* *sen*, while explaining the difference between *Prajna* and *gyan*, has written - the *chaitanyashakti* that is the cause of knowledge independent of the guru's teachings is *Prajna*, and knowledge is its function. This makes it clear that the development of consciousness independent of scriptures is *Prajna*. *Prajna* is not available through scriptural knowledge, but through inner development. *Prajna* is the knowledge beyond the intellect that discriminates between the perceptions received from sensory knowledge. *Patanjalayoga* *darshan* has pondered on *Prajna* in detail, explaining its limits and the limits of its gradual development. It has also described seven roles of *Prajna*. The more the development of restraint, the purer the *Prajna* becomes. In short, the summary is that specific knowledge is *Prajna*. Because the deep analysis of the living and the non-living takes place in *Prajnapana*, this stage is called " *Prajnapana*". *Bhagavati*, *Aavashyak* *Malayagiri* *vritti* 22, *Aavashyak* *chuni* 23, *Mahavirachariyam* 24, *Trishashtisha* *la* *ka* 14, *Uttaradhyayanasutra*, *Adhyayan* - 23 *gatha* - 28, 34, 39, 44, 49, 54, 59, 64, 69, 74, 79, 85 15, *Payarachula*, 26 / 5 / 16, *Dhavla* 9 / 4; 1, 188412 17, *Mantra* *raj* *rahasya*, *shlok* 522 18, *Yogashastra*, *svop* *gyan* *vritti*; *Suri* *mantra* *kalpa* *samucchya* *bhag* 2, page - 365 19, *Shatkhandagam*, *chaturtha* *vedana* *khand*, *Dhavla* 9, description of the nature of attainment / 20, *Tattvarthraj* *vati* *ka*, *sutra* 36 21, *Bhagavati* 1666 / 570 22, *Aavashyak* *Malayagiri* *vritti*, page - 270 23, *Pavashyak* *chuni* page - 275 24, *Mahavirachariyam* 5 / 155

In the Purusha Charitra 5, there is a mention of the ten great dreams seen by the Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira in the state of Chhapashtha. The third dream was of a multi-colored Puskokil appearing before him. The fruit of that dream was that he would proclaim the twelve-fold Shruta, full of knowledge. The words 'Prajnapayati' and 'Prarupayati' in this context clearly indicate that the Bhagwan's teachings are Prajnapana-Prarupana. This Pramam was created based on that teaching as its foundation, hence it is named 'Prajnapana'. The author of this Pramam, Shyamacharya, has given it the general name 'Adhyayan' and the specific name 'Prajnapana'. His intention is that Bhagwan Mahavira has proclaimed all the Bhavas. Similarly, I am also going to proclaim all the Bhavas here. Therefore, the specific name of this Agam is 'Prajnapana'. 27 / Like Uttaraadhyayan, the full name of this Pramam could be 'Prajnapanaadhyayan'. Prajnapana Sutra has only one Adhyayan, while Uttaraadhyayan has thirty-six Adhyayans. At the end of each chapter of Prajnapana, the text 'Pannavanaae Bhagavaie' is found, hence it is clear that the place of Bhagavati (Vyakhyaprajnapti) in the Anga literature is the same as that of 'Prajnapana' in the Upangas. In the Anga literature, phrases like "Bhagwan said this" are found. Here, the word 'Pannattum' is used. In this Agam, the word Prajnapana is also prominent, perhaps this is why Shyamacharya named it Prajnapana. In the Bhagavati Sutra, there is a description of the Praryaskandhak. There, Bhagwan Mahavira himself said - "Evam Khalu Mae Khandhaya! Chaunvihe Loe Pannatte" / Similarly, in Pracharang and other Agams, the word Prajnapana has been used for Bhagwan's teachings in many places. According to Acharya Malayagiri, the prefix 'Pra' in Prajnapana indicates the special characteristic of Bhagwan Mahavira's teachings. At the time of Bhagwan Mahavira, there were five other sects of Shraman tradition / Some of them had more followers than Mahavira's Sangha. The leadership of these five sects was respectively held by Puran Kashyap, Mankhali Goshalak, Ajitkesh Kambal, Pakudh Katyayan and Sanjay Belatthiputra. Due to the cycle of circumstances, all five sects were lost in the womb of time. Their existence is currently available only in other literature / The stream of Tathagata Buddha flowed to foreign countries and was almost extinct in India. If we contemplate on the philosophical aspects of all these Dharmacharayas, it will be clear that Bhagwan Mahavira has done a subtle analysis of the principles like Jiva, Ajeeva, etc., which no other Dharmacharaya of that era could do / Even Tathagata Buddha tried to avoid questions like Atma, Paramatma, etc. by saying 'Avyakrut'. 30 25.

In the language of *Prajñāpanā*, 'Pannavaṇī' is described as a type of language. Explaining it, Ācārya Malayagiri wrote, "The language through which the statement is made in the same way as the object is arranged, that language is 'Prajñāpanī'. 31 This is the general meaning of *Prajñāpanā*. The implication is that which does not describe any kind of religious rules and prohibitions, but only the nature of the object, that is the 'Prajñāpanī' language." Ācārya Malayagiri's opinion is that *Prajñāpanā* is a part of *Samvāya*. 33 However, it cannot be definitively said when the connection of *Prajñāpanā* with *Samvāya* was established. The author of *Prajñāpanā*, Ācārya Śyāma, believes that he took *Prajñāpanā* from *Dṛṣṭivāda*. 34 However, *Dṛṣṭivāda* is not available to us at this time, so it cannot be clearly said what material *Prajñāpanā* has taken from previous literature. However, it is certain that its object description matches with *Jñānapravāda*, *Ātmapravāda* and *Karmapravāda*. The subject of *Prajñāpanā* and the Digambara tradition's text *Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama* is mostly the same. Ācārya Bīrasena, in his *Dhavalā* commentary, has connected *Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama* with *Agrayānī Pūrva*. 31 Therefore, we can also connect *Prajñāpanā* with *Agrayānī Pūrva*. The description that is in *Samvāyāṅga* from the perspective of commentator Ācārya Malayagiri, its expansion is in *Prajñāpanā*. Therefore, *Prajñāpanā* is a part of *Samvāyāṅga*. But the scholar himself has described its connection with *Dṛṣṭivāda*. Therefore, it seems appropriate to believe that its connection is more with *Dṛṣṭivāda* than with *Samvāyāṅga*. But *Dṛṣṭivāda* mainly described *Dṛṣṭi* (vision). *Samvāyāṅga* also mainly describes the principles of *Jīva*, *Ajīva* etc., and *Prajñāpanā* also describes the same, therefore, there is no obstacle in considering *Prajñāpanā* as a part of *Samvāyāṅga*. *Prajñāpanā* has instructions for thirty-six topics, therefore, it has thirty-six chapters. The chapter is called 'Pad' in it. At the end of each chapter, the word 'Pad' is used along with the topic being discussed. Ācārya Malayagiri, while explaining 'Pad', writes, "Padam prakaraṇamarthādhikāraḥ iti paryayaḥ". 37 Therefore, here the meaning of 'Pad' should be understood as chapter and authority. 31.

The composition style of the Prajñapana is in the form of questions and answers. From the first sutra to the eighty-first sutra, there is no information about who the questioner and the answerer are. There are only questions and answers. After that, in the eighty-second sutra, there is a dialogue between Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira and Ganadhar Gautam. From the eighty-third sutra to the ninety-second sutra, there are general questions and answers. In the ninety-third sutra, there are questions and answers between Ganadhar Gautam and Mahavira. After that, from the ninety-fourth sutra to the one hundred and forty-seventh sutra, there are general questions and answers. After that, from one hundred and forty-eight to two hundred and eleven, i.e., in the entire second part; in the third part, the sutras from two hundred and twenty-five to two hundred and seventy-five and the sutras three hundred and twenty-five, three hundred and thirty to three hundred and thirty-three; from the fourth part onwards, in the sutras of all the remaining parts, questions and answers between Gautam Ganadhar and Bhagwan Mahavira are given. Only in their beginning, middle and end, the coming gathas and in one thousand eighty-six, there are no questions and answers. Just as there are authority gathas at the beginning of the entire text, similarly, there are subject-indicating gathas at the beginning of many parts. For example, there are gathas at the beginning and end of the third, eighteenth, twentieth and twenty-third parts. Similarly, at the end of the tenth part, in the middle of the text and wherever necessary, gathas have been given. The total number of verses in the entire Pāgam is seven thousand eight hundred and eighty-seven. Excluding the interpolated gathas, there are a total of two hundred and thirty-two gathas and the rest is prose. Who is the author of the Sangrahani gathas in this Pāgam? It is difficult to say. Out of the thirty-six parts of the Prajñapana, the first part describes two types of beings: Sansari and Siddha. After that, all the Sansari beings are included from Ekendriya to Panchendriya according to the order of the senses. Here, the regulating element of the types of beings is the gradual increase of the senses. In the second part, the beings are considered from the point of view of their location. Its order is also similar to the first part, i.e., sense-based. Just as there is Ekendriya there, similarly, here, the types are described by taking the earth-body, water-body, etc. bodies. From the third part onwards, in the remaining parts, the beings are divided from the point of view of motion, sense, body, yoga, kṣaya, taking, samyaktva, knowledge, vision, restraint, use, food, speaker, paritta, sufficient, subtle, sanji, bhava, astikaya, charma, jiva, kṣetra, bandha. Their minor importance has also been considered. That is, in the Prajñapana, after the third part, in the remaining parts, except for some exceptions, the beings divided into Naraka to twenty-four Dandakas have been considered. Acharya Malayagiri, while explaining the second gatha found in the Prajñapana sutra, has connected the subject-division with the description of the seven elements of Jiva, Ajīva, etc. in this way: 1-2. Jiva-Ajīva part-1, 3, 5, 10 and 13 = 5 parts 3. Prasrava- part -16, 22 = 2 parts . 39. Paṇṇavaṇāsutam, second part (publisher-Shri Mahavira Jain Vidyalaya) Introduction, page 10-11. 40.

The 4 Bandha Pada-23 5-7. Samvara, Nirjara and Moksha Pada 36 =1 Pada, the remaining Pada contain the description of some Tattva. From the Jain perspective, all the Tattvas are coordinated in Dravya, Kshetra, Kala and Bhava. Therefore, Acharya Malayagiri has included Dravya in the first Pada, Kshetra in the second Pada, Kala in the fourth Pada and Bhava in the remaining Pada. The name of the fifth Anga is Vyākhyāprajñapti and its epithet is 'Bhagavati'. Prajñāpanā is also 'Bhagavati' 1. While this epithet is not used with any other Agama. This epithet is a symbol of the importance and specialness of Prajñāpanā. Bhagavati contains information about fulfilling the subject matter according to the one, two, five, six, eleven, fifteen, seventeen, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven Pada of the Prajñāpanā Sutra. It is to be noted here that even though Prajñāpanā is an Upanga, Bhagavati etc. are not mentioned in it. On the contrary, Bhagavati mentions Prajñāpanā. The main reason for this is that the topics discussed in Prajñāpanā are described in detail in it. In Mahayana Buddhists, the 'Prajñāpāramitā' text is of great importance. Therefore, the Aṣṭa Sāhasikā Prajñāpāramitā is also called 'Bhagavati'. 41 The author of Prajñāpanā, nowhere in the original Prajñāpanā is there any mention of its author. At its beginning, after the Mangala, there are two Gāthās. Both Acharya Haribhadra and Acharya Malayagiri have explained them. But they consider those Gāthās to be interpolated. Those Gāthās clearly mention - This is the creation of Shyamacharya. Acharya Malayagiri used the epithet 'Bhagavan' for Shyamacharya. 42 Arya Shyam belonged to the Vācak lineage. He was proficient in Purvaśruta. He exhibited unique art in the creation of Prajñāpanā, due to which he has suggested to see Prajñāpanā for discussing those topics in Anga and Upanga. In Nandi-Sthaviravali, the lineage of Acharyas from Sudharma onwards is mentioned. In it, the eleventh name is 'Vandimo Hariyam cha Samajj'. Arya Svāti, the disciple of Arya Balissah of the Harit gotra, was also from the Harit gotra family. Acharya Shyam was the disciple of Arya Svāti. But in the initial interpolated Gāthā of Prajñāpanā, Arya Shyam is described as belonging to the Vācak lineage and also on the twenty-third Patta. Acharya Malayagiri has also considered him to be in the twenty-third Acharya lineage. But 41. Shiksha Samuccaya, p. 104-112, 200 42.

They have not given names from Sudharma to Shyamacharya / It is also known from the study of the Pattavalis that there have been three Acharyas named Kalkacharya. One died in 376.44 The second Kalkacharya, who destroyed the Gardhabhilla, came. His time is 453.45 The third Kalkacharya, who celebrated the Sanvatsari Mahaparva on Chaturthi instead of Panchami, his time is 993.46 In these three Kalkacharyas, the first Kalkacharya is known as 'Shyamacharya'. He was the Mahavak Acharya of his time. He was born in 280 (190 BC). He renounced the world and accepted Shraman Diksha in 300 (170 BC). He was twenty years old at the time of his initiation. On the basis of his great merit, he was adorned with the post of Yuga Pradhanacharya in 335 (135 BC). In these three Kalkacharyas, the first Kalkacharya, who is also called Shyamacharya, introduced his vast scholarship by composing a huge sutra like Prajnapan.48 From the point of view of Anuyoga, Prajnapan is under Dravyanuyoga. The entire Shraman-Sangha accepted Prajnapan as Pagam. This Acharya is a symbol of Shyam's pure policy and heartfelt faith. His name was Shyam, but due to the worship of the purest character, he was the owner of a very bright synonym / His twenty-third place is not in the Patta-Parampara in the Pattavalis. The last Kalkacharya is not the author of Prajnapan, because Nandisutr, which was composed before 993, has given Prajnapan a place in the Agam-Suchi / Therefore, now we have to think about which of the first and second Kalkacharyas is the author of Prajnapan? Dr. Umakant believes that if both Kalkacharyas are considered one, then the Shyamacharya mentioned on the eleventh Pat and the Kalkacharya who destroyed the Gardhabhilla king, both are one. In the Padavali, where they are counted separately, even there the date of one is 376 and the date of the other is 453 / If you look at it, there is a difference of 77 years between them. Therefore, whoever composed Prajnapan, whether the first or the second or both are one, it can be said for sure that the Kalkacharya (Shyamacharya) who was before Vikram was / 44.

From a traditional perspective, Acharya Shyam is more famous as a Nigoda commentator. Once, in the Mahavideha region, Shakendr heard a detailed explanation of the subtle Nigoda from Lord Simandhar. He inquired, "Oh Lord! Are there any Shramanas, Acharyas, and Upadhyayas in the Bharat Kshetra who explain Nigoda in this way?" Lord Simandhar mentioned Acharya Shyam. As an old Brahmin, Shakendr went to Acharya Shyam. To test the Acharya's knowledge, he extended his hand in front of him. Based on the palm lines, Acharya Shyam observed that the old Brahmin's lifespan was even longer than that of a Palyopama. He looked at him with a serious gaze and said, "You are not a human, but Shakendr." Shakendr was satisfied with Acharya Shyam's response. He expressed his curiosity about Nigoda. Acharya Shyam explained the subtle aspects and analysis of Nigoda, leaving Shakendr astonished. Shakendr said, "I am deeply impressed by your explanation of Nigoda, which is just like what I heard from Lord Simandhar." Seeing the divine form of the deity, a disciple might not be able to recognize him. Therefore, Shakendr, praising Acharya Shyam, was about to leave before the arrival of the monks engaged in begging alms. It is impossible to be free from ego along with knowledge. Mahabali, the exceptional practitioner Bahubali, and the conqueror of desire, Acharya Sthulbhadra, were also filled with ego. Similarly, Acharya Shyam was also consumed by ego. He said, "After your arrival, how will my disciples know without any symbolic sign?" At the Acharya's suggestion, Shakendr turned the entrance of the Upashraya from facing east to facing west. When Acharya Shyam's disciples returned after begging alms, they were astonished to see the entrance in the opposite direction. This incident of Indra's arrival is mentioned in the Kalakasuri Prabandha of the Prabhavakcharit along with Acharya Kalak. This incident is mentioned in the Visheshavashyakabhashya, Avashyakachurni, and other texts along with Arya Rakshit. From a traditional perspective, Kalak and Shyam, who explained Nigoda, are the same Acharya, as both Kalak and Shyam are synonymous. Traditionally, they were the leading Acharyas in the year 335 after the Nirvan of the Tirthankara and lived until 376. If the Prajnapan is indeed the work of the same Kalakacharya, then it was composed between 335 and 376 after the Nirvan of the Tirthankara. Primary research has proven that the Prajnapan was composed after the appointment of the Tirthankara. The Prajnapan is mentioned in the list of Pragama texts in the Nandi Sutra. The Nandi Sutra was composed before Vikram Samvat 523. Therefore, there is no contradiction with the mentioned time of the Prajnapan. Prajnapan and Shatkhandagama: A Comparison Punyavijayaji Maharaj and Pandit Dalsukh Malvaniya have provided a detailed comparison of the Prajnapan Sutra and the Shatkhandagama in the introduction to the "Pannavanasuttam" text. We are presenting a summary of the same from our perspective. The Prajnapan is the Agama of the Shvetambar tradition, while the Shatkhandagama is the Pragama of the Digambar tradition. The author of the Prajnapan is Dashapurvadhar Shyamacharya, while the authors of the Shatkhandagama are Acharya Pushpadant and Acharya Bhootbali. Digambar scholars believe that the Shatkhandagama was composed in the first century of the Vikram era. This text is divided into six sections [17]

It is known as "Shatkhandagama" because it is divided into six parts. / Historical evidence proves that Pushpadanta was before Shyamacharya, who was before Bhootbali. / Therefore, Prajnapanasutra was composed much before Shatkhandagama. Both these Agamas have "Dristivad" as their original source. 46 The subject of both these Agamas is to analyze the soul and karma from a theoretical perspective. Both have a lot of similarities in the description of "Alpbahutva", which is called "Mahadandaka". The similarity in the mention of the attainment of the positions of Tirthankara, Baldev and Vasudev in the "Gati-Pragati" chapter in both is truly remarkable. Both discuss many topics like "Avgahana", "Antar" etc. in the same way. There are thirty-six chapters in Prajnapanasutra, out of which the 23rd, 27th and 35th chapters are named as "Prakritipad", "Karmapad", "Karmabandhavedapad", "Karmavedabandhap", "Karmavedavedakpad" and "Bednap" respectively. Veerasen, the commentator of Shatkhandagama, has given six names for Shatkhandagama: "Jivasthan", "Kshudrakbandha", "Bandhaswamitva", "Vedana", "Vargana" and "Mahabanda". The facts discussed in the above mentioned chapters of Prajnapanasutra are also discussed in Shatkhandagama. Both these Agamas contemplate on the "Alpbahutva" of souls from the perspective of "Gati" and other "Margnaasthanas". There are twenty-six "Dwaras" of "Margna" in Prajnapanasutra, which discuss both soul and non-soul. / In Shatkhandagama, the "Alpbahutva" of souls is discussed keeping in mind the "Gati" and other "Margna" related to fourteen "Gunasthanas". There are twenty-six "Dwaras" of "Margna" in Prajnapanasutra, while there are fourteen in Shatkhandagama. But, a comparative study of both clearly shows that the fourteen "Margna Dwaras" mentioned in Shatkhandagama completely match fourteen out of the twenty-six "Dwaras" mentioned in Prajnapanasutra. As is clear from the following table: 49. (a) "Ajzhayanaminchittan Suyarayanam Ditthiwayani Sandam / Jah Vaniyam Bhagavaya, Ahamavi Tah Van Issami / / -Prajnapanasutra, page 1, verse 3.

"I will tell you about the punishment," as it is said, similarly in the Shatkhandagama, after contemplating the smallness of the number of living beings through the fourteen stages of the fourteen paths of motion, etc., in the fourteen Gunasthanas, the Mahadanḍaka is mentioned at the end of the presented topic. In the Prajñapana, the living being is taken as the center and the description is given, while in the Shatkhandagama, karma is taken as the center and the analysis is done, but in the second section called Khuddaband (Kshudrakaband), the idea of the bondage of the living being is discussed through the fourteen paths of motion, whose style is very similar to the Prajñapana. Many verses of Prajñapana 55 are found in the Shatkhandagama with some changes in words. Even the verses of Pavashyakaniyukti and Visheshavashyak are found in it. Similarly, the subject matter of both Prajñapana and Shatkhandagama is the same, their original source is also the same. However, due to different authors, the style of presentation of both is different. In some places, the presentation of Prajñapana is more systematic than the Shatkhandagama. My intention here is not that the authors of the Shatkhandagama, Acharya Pushpadanta and Acharya Bhootbali, copied the Prajñapana, but it is absolutely true that the composition of the Prajñapana took place before the Shatkhandagama.  /  Meaning: Its influence must have been on the composer of the Shatkhandagama. Jivaabhigam and Prajñapana Jivaabhigam is the third Upanga and Prajñapana is the fourth Upanga. Both these Agamas are external to the Anga and are therefore established. Jivaabhigam is an Upanga of the Sthananga Anga, while Prajñapana is of the Samavayanga. In both these Agamas, Jivaabhigam and Prajñapana, the various forms of the living being and the non-living being have been described. In both of them, after describing the non-living being first, the living being is described. The main difference between both these Agamas is that Jivaabhigam, being an Upanga of Sthananga, has the description of one to ten divisions.  /  The description of up to ten is almost the same in both.  /  In Prajñapana, that order progresses. The question is, in both these Agamas, Prajñapana and Jivaabhigam 54. Shatkhandagama, Book 7, p. 745 55. Samayam Vaktanam, Samayam Teshi Sarira Nivvatti.

Which was created first, historically? The *Jivaabhigam* mentions the *Prajnaapana* in many places. For example, *Sutras* 4, 5, 13, 15, 20, 35, 36, 38, 41, 86, 91, 100, 106, 113, 117, 118, 120, 121, 122. In addition, the *Rajaprashniyasutra* is mentioned in *Sutras* 109, 110, and the *Praupaatikasutra* is mentioned in *Sutra* 111. These mentions naturally raise the question: were the names of these *Praagamas* given during the *Vallhabhivachana* for convenience, or did the *Praagamarachita* *Sthavir* Bhagavan himself give them? If the author himself gave them, then the composition of *Jivaabhigam* must have occurred after the *Prajnaapana*. In response, it is submitted that the style of composition of the *Jivaabhigam* *Aagam* is such that it sequentially describes the *Jivas*. It describes the state, difference, and relative fewness of the *Jivas* among those differences. The entire *Aagam* can be divided into two sections. The first section describes the differences between the non-living and worldly *Jivas*, while the second section describes all worldly and *Siddh* *Jivas*. It describes from one difference to ten differences. However, the method of describing the subject matter in the *Prajnaapana* is also separate, and it is described in thirty-six sections. Only in the first section is the difference between the *Jiva* and the non-living made. The remaining sections sequentially describe the location, relative fewness, state, etc. of the *Jivas*. The state, etc. of the *Jivas* is found in one place. But in the *Jivaabhigam*, all these topics are not discussed together. The *Jivaabhigam* has a greater emphasis on the consideration of the object than the *Prajnaapana*. This makes it clear that the *Jivaabhigam* was composed before the *Prajnaapana*. Now, the mention of the name *Prajnaapana* in the *Jivaabhigam* is resolved by the fact that the *Prajnaapana* discusses these topics in detail. For this reason, the *Prajnaapana* is also mentioned in the *Bhagavati* and other *Anga* literature, and this mention is from the era of *Praagam* writing. The *Aagam* influencer *Punnyavijayaji* M. also believes that just as there is no auspicious invocation in the ancient *Aagams* like *Aachaarang*, *Sutra Krtaang*, etc., there is also no auspicious invocation in the *Jivaabhigam*. Therefore, its composition is before the *Prajnaapana*. An auspicious invocation is given at the beginning of the *Prajnaapana*. Therefore, it is a later composition than the *Jivaabhigam*. Auspicious invocation: A contemplative auspicious invocation was not present in the *Praagam* era. The *Aagamkar* would begin the *Praagam* with his subject matter. Since the *Aagam* itself is auspicious, an auspicious phrase was not considered mandatory. Acharya *Viraseen* and Acharya *Jinsen* have written in the *Jayadhwala* commentary on the *Kashayapahuud*: "There is no rule for an auspicious phrase in the *Praagam*. Because by focusing on meditation in the *Paramaagam*, the fruit of auspiciousness is obtained by rule." This is why Acharya *Gunadhar* did not include an auspicious invocation in his *Kashayapahuud* text. 57. See, for the *Sutra* number, *Jivaabhigam*, published by Devchand-Lalbhai in 1919 AD! 60. See, *Pannavanasutam*, Part 2, published by Mahavira Jain Vidyalaya, Mumbai, Introduction page 14-15 61. *Etth Pun Niyamo Patthi, Paramagamuvajogamminiyamenena Mangalaphalaovalambhado*. - *Kashayapahuud*, Part 1, verse 1, page 9. 62. *Edasth Athavisesass Jaanavan8 Gunahar Bhattaraena Ganthassaadie Na Mangalam Kayam*. - *Kashayapahuud*, Part 1, verse 1, page 9.

Except for the Bhagavati Sutra, there is no Mangalavamyam at the beginning of any other Agam in the Dvadasanga. Similarly, Mangalgatha are found at the beginning of Prajnapan in the Upanga. In those gatha, Siddha is first saluted. After that, Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira is saluted. / All the ancient handwritten copies of Prajnapan that have been found, all of them have the Panchanamaskar Maha Mantra inscribed. / The commentators of Prajnapan, Acharya Haribhadra and Acharya Malayagiri, have not explained the Panchanamaskar Maha Mantra. Due to this, the opinion of Pragam Prabhavak Punyavijayaji M., Pandit Dalsukhbhai Malvaniya, etc. is that the Namaskar Maha Mantra was not in it at the time of the creation of Prajnapan. But the scribes may have established it at the beginning. / In Shatkhandagam also, according to the opinion of Acharya Viresen, there is a directive for the Panchanamaskar Maha Mantra. In Prajnapan, Siddha is first saluted and then Arihant is saluted, whereas in the Panchanamaskar Maha Mantra, Arihant is first saluted and then Siddha. In the Agam literature like Uttaradhyayanas, it is clearly mentioned that when a Tirthankara takes initiation, he salutes the Siddhas. From this perspective, the tradition of saluting the Siddhas first began in the people's tradition. Since Tirthankara, i.e. Arihant, is a direct benefactor, he has been given the first place in the Panchanamaskar Maha Mantra. In the past, Maharaja Kharavel, who was the king of Kalinga, had the inscriptions engraved, in which Arihant was first saluted and then Siddha. The opinion of the great thinkers is that until the establishment of the Tirth, the Siddhas are first saluted, and when the Tirth is established, the Arihant is first saluted because of being the nearest benefactor, and then the tradition of saluting the Siddhas began. This method of Mangalacharan is found in the oldest texts. This does not mean that this was definitely the order. As far as the question of Vandana is concerned, it depends on the feeling of the Sadhak. In the absence of Tirthankaras, the Acharyas and Upadhyayas who represent the Tirthankara tradition strongly are also considered worthy of worship, and the Sadhus who are the holders of the Acharya, Upadhyaya position are also accepted as the fifth position in the form of salutation. Who created the Panchparameshthinamaskar Maha Mantra? This question was first raised in the Aavashyakniyukti. In response, the Niyuktikar Bhadrabah gave the solution that the Panchparameshthinamaskar Maha Mantra is a part of Samayik. Therefore, one should first salute the Panchparameshthis and then do Samayik. The Namaskar Maha Mantra is as old as the Samayik Sutra. / The Tirthankaras are the interpreters of Samayik and the Ganadharas are the Sutrakaras. / Therefore, the Tirthankaras are also the interpreters of the Namaskar Maha Mantra and the Ganadharas are its Sutrakaras. The second question is whether the Panchanamaskar is a part of the Aavashyak or is it established elsewhere? This question has also been clearly answered by Jinabhadragani Kshamasraman in the Visheshavashyakbhashya, that Acharya Devavachaka has not counted the Panchanamaskar Maha Mantra as a separate Shrutaskandha in the Nandi Sutra. 63.

However, it is clear that this is a sutra and also the first mangal, therefore, the Namaskaramantra is not only a part of the Pravashyakasutra, but also the Adi Mangal form of the Sarvasruta. It is necessary to offer salutations while reciting any shruta. Acharya Bhadrabahu has discussed the origin and non-origin of the Namaskaramantra in depth from the perspective of various naya. Acharya Jinabhadra has discussed the eternal and non-eternal nature of words from a philosophical perspective in his detailed commentary and has contemplated on it from the perspective of naya. The author of this Maha Mantra is unknown. An ancient Acharya has clearly written, "Ahead there are 24 infinite ones, there will be infinite times! No one knows the origin of Navkar, Yamakhyo Bhagavant!" !! Mahanishith, whose redeemer is considered to be Acharya Haribhadra, in it the redeemer of the Maha Mantra is considered to be Arya Vajraswami and from the perspective of Veerasen Acharya, the commentator of Dhavala, who came after Acharya Haribhadra, the performer of Namaskar is Acharya Pushpadanta. The existence period of Acharya Pushpadanta is the seventh century after Veer Nirvana (1st century AD). We have already mentioned that the Kharavel inscription, which is 152 BC, contains the words "Namo Arahatanam, Namo Savvasiddhanam." This makes it clear that the Namaskaramantra existed long before Acharya Pushpadanta. From the perspective of the Shwetambar tradition, the authors of the Namaskaramantra are Tirthankara and Ganadhara. As is clear from the Pravashyakaniyukti. In the first step of the Prasttikaya: a contemplation of Prajnaapata, the difference and non-difference between Jiva and Ajiva have been explained and then discussions of those differences and non-differences have been done in the subsequent steps. In the first step, there is a detailed explanation regarding Ajiva. Ajiva has been explained in two differences, Rupee and Praroopee, and in Rupee, the Pudgal dravya has been explained and in Praroopee, the Ajiva dravya has been described in the form of Dharmaastikaya, Adharmaastikaya, and Praadi. But in the present Agam, while describing these differences, the word Astikaya has been used, but the words dravya, tattva, and padarth have not been used, which is a symbol of the antiquity of the Agam. Dharmaastikaya, Adharmaastikaya, and Akashaastikaya have been divided into these differences of Desh and Pradesh. But the meaning of the word Astikaya has not been given anywhere in the original Agam. The word Astikaya has not been used with the Pradha-samaya. This makes it clear that there is a difference between the Pradha samaya and Dharmaastikaya etc. The word Astikaya has not been used with Jiva in the present Pragam, but this does not mean that Jiva does not have Pradesh, because contemplation on the Pradesh of Jiva has been done in the fifth step of Prajnaapana. Those who have been called the fundamental differences between Ajiva and Jiva in the first step, have been called Jivaparyaya and Ajiva Paryaya in the fifth step. In the thirteenth step, they have been presented with the name Parinam. By explaining these two differences of Ajiva, Aroopee and Roopee, Dharmaastikaya, Adharmaastikaya, Akashaastikaya, and Shraddha Samaya have been included under Praroopee Ajiva. 65.

Each has been divided. Here, the meaning of "desh" is the two, three, etc., regional divisions conceived by the intellect, such as dharmaastikaya, etc., and the meaning of "pradesh" is the excellent "desh" conceived by the intellect, such as dharmaastikaya, etc., which cannot be further divided, the indivisible division "pradesh". The aggregate of all the "pradeshes" of dharmaastikaya, etc., is "skandha". "Shraddha" refers to time, and "addhaaroop" time is "addhasamay". The present time has only one time, "sat". The past and the future are either destroyed or not yet born. Therefore, there is no conception of a combination of "desh" and "pradesh" in time. The conception of "asankhyaat samaya" etc., as a group-like "praabalikaa" is practical. "Pudgal" is taken under the "roopee ajeev". Its "skandha", "skandhadesh", "skandhapradesh", and "paramaanu" pudgal are the four types. "Pudgal" is endowed with color, smell, taste, touch, and substance. Twenty varieties of five colors, forty-six varieties of two smells, one hundred varieties of five tastes, one hundred and eighty-four varieties of eight touches, one hundred varieties of five substances, in this way, there are five hundred and thirty varieties of "roopee ajeev" and thirty varieties of "aroop ajeev". From the point of view of etymology, the word "prastikaya" is formed by the combination of the two words "asti" and "kaya". The meaning of "asti" is "existence" or "being", and the meaning of "kaya" here is not in the form of a body-like "astivaan". Because, in "panchaastikaya", except for "pudgal", the rest are abstract, therefore, here "kaya" has a metaphorical meaning - those substances that are composed of parts are "prastikaya", and that which is a non-composite substance is "anastkaya". In other words, that which has different parts or sections is "astikaya". Here, there may be a natural curiosity as to how far it is logical to conceive of parts or components in "prakhunda" substances? Because, dharma, adharma, and aakash, all three are one, indivisible, and undivided. So, what is the meaning of their being composed of parts? If we accept the meaning of "kayatva" as "saabayatva", then one problem arises, that "paramaanu" is indivisible, without parts, and without components, so is it not "astikaya"? "Paramanu" is a division of "pudgal" itself, and yet it is considered "astikaya". Jain thinkers have pondered over all these questions. They have also solved all those questions. It is true that dharma, adharma, and aakash are indivisible and undivided substances, but from the point of view of the field, they are all-pervading. Therefore, from the point of view of the field, the concept of "saavayatva" or the conception of division has been made at the intellectual level. "Paramanu" itself is without parts, indivisible, and without components, but "paramanu" itself is not in the form of "kaya", but when it takes the form of "paramanu skandha", it takes on "kayatva" and "saavayatva". Therefore, "kayatva" is considered to be present in "paramanu" as well. "Astikaya" and "anastkaya" are also considered to be based on the classification of "bahupradeshtva". Those substances that are "bahupradeshtva" are "astikaya", and those that are "ekapradeshtva" are "anastkaya". Here too, there may be a natural curiosity as to whether dharma, adharma, and aakash, all three substances are "ekapradeshi" from the point of view of "svadravy", because they are undivided. Siddhantachkravarti Nemichandra, while solving this curiosity, has clearly written that "bahupradeshtva" in dharma, adharma, and aakash is not from the point of view of "dravy", but from the point of view of the field. From the point of view of the field, dharma and adharma have been called "asankhyapradeshi", and aakash has been called "anantapradeshi". Therefore, the concept of "kayatva" has been applied to them. "Pudgal" is "bahupradeshi" not from the point of view of "paramaanu", but from the point of view of "skandha", and "astikaya" is also from the point of view of "bahupradeshtva". "Paramanu" itself is a part of "pudgal". Here, the meaning of "kayatva" is to be extensive. The present concept of extension is based on the concept of the field. That substance which is 67.

## Translation:

**Extensiveness is absent, they are anastikaya.** / **Here, extensiveness means the area that a substance occupies.** / **One may wonder why time-substance, which is all-pervasive, is not considered astikaya? The answer is that time-atoms are present in every region of the universe. But each time-atom is independent. Due to the absence of smoothness and roughness qualities, they are not bound together, hence they remain independent of each other. Due to the absence of binding, they do not form aggregates.** / **In the absence of aggregates, the concept of region-extension cannot be conceived. In time-substance, the concept of region-extension cannot be conceived in both its form and treatment.** / **Space-substance encompasses all substances. If space-substance is not extensive, it will not be able to provide space for other substances.** / **In its absence, other substances cannot exist. Dharma-substance is the medium of motion. It is extensive and pervasive in the area where motion is possible. If the medium of motion itself is not extensive, how can motion be possible in it? For example, a fish can move only in the area where there is water. Similarly, the motion of pudgala and jiva is possible in the area where dharma-substance is present. Therefore, dharma-substance is considered to be extensive throughout the universe. The same applies to adharma-substance. Due to adharma-substance, atoms form aggregates. Adharma-substance is responsible for keeping atoms organized in the form of aggregates. The soul has countless regions. Adharma-substance is responsible for keeping these countless regions confined to the body. Adharma-substance plays a significant role in maintaining the order of the universe. Therefore, adharma-substance is also considered to be all-pervasive. In the absence of adharma-substance, the fundamental constituents of the universe, the atoms, would be scattered. No kind of creation would be possible. Wherever there is a medium of motion, there is also a need for a medium of position, which controls motion. To maintain the motion of the universe and to keep it balanced, pradharm-substance is considered to be all-pervasive. Therefore, it is included in astikaya. Pudgala-substance also has extensiveness. It transforms from atoms into aggregates. Atoms possess smoothness and roughness qualities, which enable them to form aggregates. Therefore, it has kayatva due to its treatment. Due to pudgala-substance, there is materiality in the universe.** / **If pudgala-substance did not exist, the possibility of a material universe would be destroyed.** / **Jiva-substance is also extensive.** / **Just as the body has extensiveness, the soul also has extensiveness. At the time of kevalisamudghata, the countless regions of the soul become pervasive throughout the universe. Therefore, it is included in astikaya.** / **We have already explained that time-atoms do not form aggregates or conglomerates due to the absence of smoothness and roughness qualities.** / **We experience time from the beginningless past to the endless future, but we cannot attribute kayatva to it. The characteristic of time is only in the present. The present is only a moment, which is very subtle. Therefore, we cannot consider region-extension in time, and in the absence of region-extension, it is not astikaya. It is important to remember that the area of extensiveness is not the same for all substances. Space-substance is present in both the universe and the non-universe. Dharma and adharma substances are limited to the universe only. The area of extensiveness of pudgala and jiva is not similar. The size of a pudgala-particle will be its extensiveness. The jiva will also take on the size of its body. For example, even an ant...**

There are countless regions in a single atom, and even in an elephant. This clearly shows that the extent of all living beings is not the same. The Bhagavati Sutra beautifully describes the concept of "alp bahutva" (lesser and greater) from the perspective of eight regions. It states that Dharma and Adharma substances are the least abundant compared to other substances. They are countless in regions and are limited to the Lokakasha (the space of the universe). 

The regions of Jiva (living beings) are infinitely greater than those of Dharma and Adharma substances. This is because Dharma and Adharma are singular, while Jivas are infinite, and each Jiva has countless regions. The regions of Pudgala (matter) are infinitely greater than those of Jiva, as each Jiva's atomic region contains countless karmas, which are Pudgala. Even compared to Pudgala, the regions of Kala (time) are infinitely greater, as each Jiva and Pudgala has countless Paryayas (moments) in the present, past, and future. The number of regions of Akasha (space) is the greatest compared to Kala. All other substances are limited to the Lokakasha, while Akasha exists in both Lokakasha and Alokakasha (the space beyond the universe). 

One might wonder how countless Pudgala atoms can fit in the countless regions of Lokakasha. If one Akasha region can hold one Pudgala atom, then countless regions can hold countless Pudgala atoms. 

There is no obstacle to having infinite atoms in an Akasha region. This is because atoms and atomic clusters possess a unique "Avagahan Shakti" (capacity to accommodate). Just as Akasha, due to its Avagahan Guna (property of accommodating), provides space for other substances, similarly, atoms and clusters, due to their Avagahan Shakti, accommodate other atoms and clusters. For example, a light bulb in a room emits light, and if a thousand more bulbs are added, their light will also be contained within the room. Similarly, we can consider sound. From a Jain perspective, there are countless sounds in a single Akasha region. It is important to remember that light and sound, though Pudgalic, are also "Mritta" (non-permanent). If countless atomic clusters can exist in a single Akasha region in the case of the material, then it is not a question for the immaterial. No matter how dense a Pudgala cluster is, it has the capacity to accommodate other infinite atoms and Pudgala clusters. 

It is possible that from the perspective of the most refined type of atom, it is said that one Akasha region is the size of one atom. From the perspective of motion, the slowest motion is that of one atom in one Kala (moment). In other words, the time it takes for one atom to travel from one Akasha region to another is one Kala, which is the smallest division of time. From the perspective of the fastest motion, one atom can travel fourteen Raju Lokas (universes) in one Kala. 

In the modern age, science has made tremendous progress. Its unprecedented advancement is astonishing to scientists. Science has also recognized space, time, and matter as the fundamental basis of the universe. Without these three elements, the structure of the universe is not possible. Einstein, through his theory of relativity, has...

---------------------------
This has attempted to prove that space and time are relative. / The dynamic substance, which has been called Dharma-dravya, has been called 'ether' by science. After modern research, the nature of ether has also changed a lot. Now ether has become a non-physical, non-physical element, which is very close to the concept of Dharma-dravya. Pudgala is the basic foundation of the universe, even if scientists do not consider it an independent substance, but scientists are constantly exploring new things. / It is possible that in the near future they will accept the independent existence of Pudgala and Jiva. Siddha: In the first step of a contemplation-cognition, after the cognition of the non-living, contemplation has been done regarding the cognition of the living. Two main distinctions have been made of the living being, worldly and Siddha. Those who live, who hold life, are living beings. There are two types of life-dravya-pran and bhava-pran. Five senses, three mental powers, verbal power and physical power, breathing and lifespan, these are the ten dravya-pran. / Knowledge, vision, happiness and vigor, these are the four bhava-pran. A worldly living being is endowed with both dravya and bhava pran, and Siddha living beings are endowed only with bhava pran. Those who wander in the four paths of hell, animal, human and god are worldly-accomplished. They are worldly living beings. / Those who are free from worldly wandering are non-worldly-accomplished-Siddha living beings. They have attained the state of Siddha, free from all the sorrows of birth and death. Fifteen distinctions of Siddhas have been presented here. These fifteen distinctions have been made from the point of view of time, gender, dress and situation etc. Those living beings who become Siddha after the establishment of the Tirtha are 'Tirtha Siddha'. / Those living beings who become Siddha before the establishment of the Tirtha or after the dissolution of the Tirtha are 'Atirtha Siddha'. For example, Mata Marudevi became Siddha before the establishment of the Tirtha of Bhagwan Rishabhdev. The Siddhi journey of Mata Marudevi took place before the establishment of the Tirtha. If there is a break in the rule during the interval of two Tirthankaras and during that time any living being becomes Siddha with special knowledge like jati-smara, then they are called 'Tirthavyavchhed' Siddha. Both these types of Siddha come under the category of Atirtha Siddha. Those who become Siddha by becoming Tirthankara are called 'Tirthankara Siddha'. / Ordinary Kevali are called 'Pratitirthankara Siddha'. / Those who become Siddha by becoming self-enlightened without preaching, understanding the futility of the world, are 'Swayambuddha Siddha'. In Nandiini, two types of Swayambuddha are mentioned - 'Tirthankara' and 'Tirthankara-bhinna'. Here, Swayambuddha has been taken as different from Tirthankara Swayambuddha. / Those who become Siddha by becoming enlightened by any external cause like bull, tree, cloud etc. are 'Pratyekabuddha Siddha'. Pratyekabuddha do not stay in a group-bound Gachchha. / They usually wander alone. It should be remembered here that both Swayambuddha and Pratyekabuddha do not need preaching, however, the main difference between the two is that Swayambuddha has knowledge like jati-smara etc. while Pratyekabuddha is only enlightened by external cause. / Those who become Siddha by being enlightened by a bodhi-gained Acharya are 'Buddhabodhit Siddha'. The Bhavyatmas who become Siddha in the female gender are called 'Striling Siddha'. 69. Prajnapana Sutra, Malayagiri Vriti 70.

In the Svetambara literature, women are considered to be capable of attaining liberation (nirvana), while the Digambara tradition's texts prohibit women from attaining liberation. The Shatkhandagama, a text accepted by the Digambara tradition, while contemplating the state of human women, states that "human women are subject to the eight types of time-bound delusions (samaya-gami-thyasht), and are found in the states of un-controlled right faith (asanyata-samyag-darshi), controlled-uncontrolled (sanyata-asanyata), and controlled (sanyata) states." The editors have provided a note on the word "sanyata" in this text, which essentially states that a human woman can attain the "sanyata" state, and upon attaining this state, she can attain liberation. This question led to a strong atmosphere of opposition within the Digambara community, and the editors of the text, including Dr. Hiralalji Jain, provided a further explanation in the introduction to the third part of the Shatkhandagama. However, when scholars examined the original manuscript of the Shatkhandagama in Moodbidri (Karnataka), they found the word "sanyata" in it as well. In the Mulachara, composed by Vattkeeraswami, while analyzing the conduct of the Praayikas, it is stated that "those ascetics or Aryikas who conduct themselves in this manner, attain worship, fame, and happiness in the world, and attain liberation." This also mentions the Praayikas attaining liberation, although it is not clear whether they attain liberation in the same life or in a subsequent life. Later Digambara Acharyas, in their own texts and commentaries on ancient texts, have explicitly prohibited women from attaining liberation. Those who attain liberation through a male body are called "purushaling-siddha." Those who attain liberation through a neuter body are called "napunsakaling-siddha." Those who attain liberation in the Shraman-paryaya, as established by the Tirthankaras, are called "svaling-siddha." Those who attain liberation through the guise of a Parivajak, etc., are called "anyaling-siddha." Those who attain liberation in the guise of a Mahastha are called "gahilim-siddha." Those who attain liberation alone at a particular time are called "ekasiddha." Those who attain liberation together at the same time are called "anekasiddha." In addition to these fifteen categories of Siddhas, other categories of Siddhas have also been presented. All fifteen types of Siddhas mentioned above fall into two categories: Tirtha-siddha and Atirtha-siddha. The main purpose of elaborating on this is to explain the state of the being before attaining liberation. The commentator of the Prajnapanna has also accepted this. Just as the Jain Agamas describe the types of Siddhas, the Buddhist Agamas, from the perspective of the Sthaviravada, describe three types of Bodhi: Savakabodhi (Shravakabodhi), Pacchekabodhi (Pratyekabodhi), and Sammasambodhi (Samyak Sambodhi). Savakabodhi is the enlightenment that a devotee attains through the teachings of others. A Shravakabuddha is also entitled to teach others. From the Jain perspective, Pratyekabodhi does not require the teachings of others, and similarly, Pacchekabodhi does not require the teachings of others. Their lives are an ideal for others. 71.

**Sammasambodhi** attains enlightenment through their own strong efforts and can also bestow that enlightenment upon others. They can be compared to a **Tirthankara**.

**75 Aryas and Anaryas:** An analysis has discussed the various distinctions of **Siddhas**, and then explained the various distinctions of worldly beings. The basis of these distinctions is the senses. Distinctions of beings have also been explained from the perspective of their subtlety, **paryāpta** and **aparyāpta** vision. All beings from **ekendriya** to **chaturindriya** are **samūchchhima**. **Tiryach** with five senses and humans are both **garbhaja** and **samūchchhima**. The birth of hell beings and gods is **upapāta**. **Samūchchhima** and hell beings are exclusively eunuchs. There are both male and female gods, no eunuchs.

**Garbhaja** humans and **garbhaja** **tiryach** have all three genders. Thus, distinctions of beings have been made from the perspective of gender. Hell realm, **tiryach** realm, human realm, and god realm, these distinctions have been made for beings with five senses from the perspective of realm. Two divisions have been made: **prasamsārasamāpana** and **samsārasamāpanna**. **Prasamsārasamāpanna** beings are **Siddhas**. After explaining their various distinctions, five distinctions have been made for worldly beings from the perspective of senses. Then, various distinctions of **ekendriya** have been explained, such as **pṛthvīkāya**, **apkāya**, **tejas kāya**, **vāyukāya**, **vanaspatikāya**, etc. After **ekendriya**, there is a description of **dvīndriya**, **trīndriya**, **chaturindriya**, and **panchendriya**. After describing hell beings and **tiryach** with five senses, there is a description of humans. Two distinctions have been made for humans: **samūchchhima** and **garbhaja**. Humans are **praupacārika** humans; they are born in the filth, urine, phlegm, etc. of **garbhaja** humans, therefore they are called humans.

**Garbhaja** humans are of three types: **karmabhūmija**, **akarmabhūmija**, and **antarvīpaja**. There are fifteen **karmabhūmis**: five **Bharatas**, five **Airavatas**, and five **Mahāvidehas**. Humans born in these lands perform actions and earn their livelihood, therefore humans born in these lands are called **karmabhūmija**. **Karmabhūmija** humans are also of two types: **ārya** and **mleccha**. **Ārya** humans are also of two types: **ṛddhiprapta** and **anṛddhiprapta**. In **Prajñāpanā**, six types of **ṛddhiprapta** **ārya** have been explained: **arihant**, **chakravarti**, **vāsudeva**, **baladeva**, **cāraṇa**, and **vidyadhara**. In **Tattvārthavārtika**, eight types of **ṛddhiprapta** **ārya** have been explained: **buddhi**, **kriyā**, **vikriyā**, **tapa**, **bala**, **auṣadha**, **rasa**, and **kṣetra**. In **Prajñāpanā**, nine types of **anṛddhiprapta** **ārya** have been explained: **kṣetrārya**, **jātyārya**, **kulārya**, **karmārtha**, **śilpārya**, **bhāṣārya**, **jñānārya**, **darśanārya**, and **cāritrārya**.

In the Tattvarthavartika, the types of Aryas who have attained non-attachment are categorized into five types: Kshetrarya, Jatyarya, Karmarya, Charitraraya, and Darshanarya. In the Tattvarthabhashya, the types of Aryas who have attained non-attachment are categorized into six types: Kshetrarya, Jatyarya, Kularya, Shilparya, Karmarya, and Bhasharya. 80 From the perspective of Prajnapanna, humans residing in twenty-five and a half countries are considered Kshetrarya. These countries are called Arya Janapada because Tirthankaras, Chakravartis, Baldev, Vasudev were born in these countries. The same definition of Arya is given in Pravachansaroaddhar. Jinadasgani Mahttar has written that the regions where Yogalikas resided, where the principles of Hakaar etc. were prevalent, those regions are Arya and the rest are Anarya. 82 From this perspective, the boundaries of Arya Janapadas expand. 83 In the Tattvarthabhashya, it is written that humans born during the victories of Chakravartis are also considered Aryas. 84 In the Tattvarthavartika, humans born in Janapadas like Kashi, Kaushal etc. are called Kshetrarya. 85 This means that Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab, Western Punjab, and Sindh were partially or fully included in the Arya Kshetra, while the remaining provinces were not within that boundary. 86 The Dakshinapatha was not within the boundary of Arya Kshetra. 87 The Aryas dominated North India, and it is possible that the boundary was determined based on this perspective. 88 In the Prajnapanna, the list of twenty-five and a half countries does not mention Avanti, while Avanti was a famous kingdom during the time of Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira. 89 The king of Avanti was Chandrapratyot. 90 Bhagwan Mahavira arrived from Avanti when he came to Sindhusauvira. 91 Sindhusauvira was eighty yojanas away from Avanti. 92 Jainism was prevalent in the south, yet those regions were not included in the list of Arya Kshetras. 93 This is a question for the wise to ponder. 94 It is also possible that the regions not considered Arya may have been dominated by pre-Aryan tribes. 95 In the Prajnapanna, six types of Jati-Arya humans are mentioned: Ambashtha, Kalinda, Videha, Harit, Vedak, and Chuchun. 96 Six types of Kularya humans are mentioned: Ugra, Bhog, Rajanya, Ikshvaku, Jnat, and Kaurav. 97 In the Tattvarthavartika, Jati-Arya and Kul-Arya are not considered different. 98 Humans born in the Ikshvaku, Jnat, and Bhog clans are considered Jatyarya. 99 In the Tattvarthabhashya, Ikshvaku, Videha, Hari, Ambashtha, Jnat, Kuru are mentioned. 100

The *Bumbu*, *Nala*, *Ugra*, *Bhoga*, *Rajanya* and others are *Jatyarya* and *Kularya* with pure lineage originating from *Kulkaras* like *Chakravarti*, *Baldeva*, *Vasudeva* and the third, fifth and seventh *Kulkaras* and the rest. In *Prajnapan*, merchants of *Dusyak-Vastra*, merchants of *Sut*, merchants of *Kapas* or *Rui*, *Nai*, *Kumhar* etc. are considered as *Karyas* who perform *Praryakarma*. There are many types of *Shilparya* humans like *Tunnag* (rougheners), *Tantuvaay* (weavers), *Pustakar*, *Lepyakar*, *Chitrakara* etc. In *Tattvarthavatik*, *Karyas* and *Shilparyas* are considered the same. They have classified *Karyas* into three categories: *Savadhya Karya*, *Alp Savadhya Karya* and *Asavadhya Karya*. Those who perform *Asi*, *Mashi*, *Krishi*, *Vidya*, *Shilp* and *Vanikkarma* are *Savadhya Karyas*. *Shravak* and *Shravika* are *Alp Savadhya Karyas*; *Samyami Shraman* are *Asavadhya Karyas*. In *Tattvarthabhashya*, *Yajan*, *Yajan*, *Adhyayan*, *Adhyapan*, *Prayog*, *Krishi*, *Lipi*, *Vanijya* and *Yoni Samposhan* are considered as *Shilparya* for those who earn their livelihood from weaving, pottery, barbering, tailoring and other various types of artisans. In *Prajnapan*, those who speak *Ardhamagadhi* language and write in *Brahmi* script are called *Bhasharya*. *Tattvarthavatik* does not mention *Bhasharya*. In *Tattvarthabhashya*, those who pronounce the language of civilized humans with fixed letters, *Lokarudh*, clear words and five types of *Paryas* correctly are considered as *Bhasharya*. Bhagwan Mahavira himself spoke *Ardhamagadhi* language. *Ardhamagadhi* is considered as *Devavani*. *Samyak Gyani* is considered as *Gyanarya*, *Samyak Drishti* is considered as *Darshanarya* and *Samyak Charitri* is considered as *Charitraraya*. *Gyanarya*, *Darshanarya*, *Charitraraya* all three are related to the religious world. Those humans who have attained these three jewels, no matter what caste or family they belong to, are *Aryas*. In the absence of these three jewels, they are *Anaryas*. The division of *Paryas* has been done from a geographical perspective, from the perspective of livelihood, from the perspective of caste and language. The reason for considering 25 and a half countries as *Paryas* from our perspective could be that Jainism and Jain culture have been widely propagated there. From this perspective, they may have been called *Arya Janapada*. The scholars of the Vedic tradition have written about the *Ang*, *Bang* etc. *Janapadas*: "Ang-Bang-Kalingeshusourastramagadheshucha. Tirthayatraam Vina Gachchan Punah Sanskaramhati //" i.e. in *Ang* (Munger-Bhagalpur), *Bang* (Bengal), *Kaling* (Odisha), *Saurashtra* (Kathiawar) and *Magadh* (Patna Gaya etc.), one has to be purified again by performing *Upanayanadi* rituals after going there except for pilgrimage.

Many thinkers believe that the distinction between Ārya and Anārya, as seen in the context of Prajñāpanā and Jīvājīvābhigam, is a division that occurred after the Ārya and Anārya races had intermingled. This division is not based on caste or physical constitution. / The Sūtrakṛtāṅga makes a division based on caste and physical constitution. It states: "There are humans in all four directions: east, west, north, and south. Among them, some are Ārya and some are Anārya. Some are of high lineage and some are of low lineage; some are tall and some are short; some are of superior caste and some are of inferior caste, i.e., dark; some are beautiful and some are ugly." / The Ṛgveda also mentions two divisions: Ārya and Prāryatar. There were many prosperous Anārya races; they had their own language, civilization, culture, wealth, and religious beliefs. / The Prajñāpanā distinguishes between two types of Karmabhūmij humans: Ārya and Mleccha. / The Tattvārthabhāṣya and Tattvārthavārtika distinguish between two types of Antīpaj humans. There are many definitions of Mleccha. / From the perspective of Pravacanasārōddhār, those who are far from evil conduct and close to beneficial conduct are Ārya. / Those who have embraced evil conduct are Anārya. Ācārya Malayagiri writes in the Prajñāpanāvṛtti that those whose behavior is not refined are Mleccha. / The Pravacanasārōddhār states: "Those who are sinful, who engage in violent actions, who do not have aversion in their inner mind towards sin, who do not have remorse for wrong actions, and who do not even remember the word 'Dharma' in their dreams, are Anārya." / The Praśnavyākaraṇa states: "Mleccha humans engage in various types of violence." / These definitions of Ārya and Mleccha are not based on race or region, but on qualities. In Kauṭilya's Arthaśāstra, the word Ārya is used to refer to independent citizens and the word Dāsa to refer to enslaved citizens. / The Prajñāpanā refers to one division of Karmabhūmij humans as Anārya or Mleccha. Those born in Anārya countries are called Anārya. The Prajñāpanā lists the names of Anārya countries as follows: 94. Atit Ka Anāvaraṇ, Bhāratiya Jñānapīṭh, page 155 95. Sūtrakṛtāṅga 201 96.

Humans are the most powerful and intelligent beings. They are many in number but one in caste. The differences mentioned above are from a geographical and quality perspective. After discussing the differences and sub-differences of the abode of the worldly and the Siddha, contemplation has been done regarding the abode of those beings. The main reason for this contemplation is that there are many imaginations in the Upanishads regarding the size of the soul. In the end, the thought of the sages has been towards considering the soul as vast. Almost all Vedic philosophies have considered the soul as vast. However, Acharya Shankar and Acharya Ramanuj, the commentators of Brahma Sutras, are exceptions. They have considered Brahma Atma as vast and Jivatma as the size of a particle. In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the soul has been considered to be the size of a grain of rice or barley. In the Kathopanishad, the soul has been written as 'thumb-sized'. In the Chandogya Upanishad, the soul has been called 'balishta' size. In the Maitri Upanishad, the soul has been considered as subtle as an atom. In the Kathopanishad, Chandogya Upanishad and Shvetashvetar Upanishad, the soul has been called both smaller than an atom and greater than the greatest. In the Sankhya philosophy, the soul has been considered as Kutestha Nitya, meaning that the soul does not undergo any kind of change or transformation. The world and liberation are not of the soul but of nature. Happiness, sorrow, knowledge, these are not of the soul.

Page #1153:
---------------------------
But nature has its own laws. In this way, it considers the soul to be completely unchanging. Even though there is no agency, it believes that experience is in the soul itself. '17 Based on this experience, there is a possibility of change in the soul, therefore many Sankhya do not consider experience to be the dharma of the soul. '' They have protected the meaning of the soul being detached. In the Kathopanishad etc., the soul is also considered detached. '16 In Jainism, the soul is considered to be all-pervasive, it is body-measure-pervasive. It has both contraction and expansion qualities. The soul is not considered to be eternally detached, but it is considered to be eternally changing / In this vast universe, it takes birth in the form of various permutations and combinations, and it is only at a fixed place that the soul takes on a body. It became necessary to contemplate on the question of which being is in which place, so in the second step of Prajnapan, contemplation was done in relation to place. There are two types of places - one permanent, the other incidental / After taking birth, the place where the being lives until death is the permanent place, the permanent place has been called self-place by Pagamkar. The incidental dwelling place is of two types - in the form of arrival and expansion / From the Jain perspective, when the life of a being is complete, it takes birth in a new place. A being is about to become a human after completing its divine life. That being comes from the divine realm to the human realm. The journey that it makes in between is not its self-place. It is an incidental journey, that journey has been called the arrival place. The second incidental place is expansion / The expansion of the realms of the being on specific occasions like pain, death, reaction etc. is expansion. During expansion, the soul-realm remains in the body-place, but it also remains in some place outside for the duration of the expansion. Therefore, from the perspective of expansion, the incidental dwelling place of the being has been considered / In this way, in the second step, contemplation has been done in relation to all three types of places - self-place, arrival place and expansion place. It should also be remembered here that in the first step, contemplation has not been done on the places of many common distinctions like one-sensory, among the designated distinctions of beings, only the places of the main distinctions have been considered. Contemplation has been done from the perspective of arrival, expansion and self-place for worldly beings, but only contemplation of self-place has been done for the liberated ones. The liberated ones do not have arrival / Other worldly beings have the rise of karmas like name, lineage, lifespan etc., due to which they go from one state to another. The liberated ones are free from karmas. Due to the absence of karmas, they do not take birth in the liberated form. From the Jain perspective, the beings who go up to the end of the universe do not touch the luminous realms, 10 therefore the liberated ones do not have an arrival place. Only karmic beings expand, not the liberated ones / Therefore, in the present case, contemplation has been done only on the self-place of the liberated ones. One-sensory beings are spread throughout the universe. Two-sensory, three-sensory, four-sensory and general five-sensory beings are in countless parts of the universe. Separate places have been designated for hellish and celestial five-sensory beings, humans and gods. 116. Sankhyakarika 11 117. Sankhyakarika 17 118. Sankhyatattvakaumudi 17 119.

It has been done and is situated in the forefront of the Siddha Loka. Here it must be remembered that when a Chham-sth man performs Samudghāt, he touches an innumerable part of the Loka, and when a Kevali performs Samudghāt, he touches the entire Loka. When the Prātm-pradesh of a man expands throughout the entire Loka, at that time his Prātmā becomes Loka-vyāpt. The question is why the location of the Ajīva has not been considered? It seems that just as we can imagine a definite location for the different types of Jīvas, we cannot do so in relation to the Pudgala. / Atoms and Skandhas are in the entire Loka-ākāśa, but their location is not definite. Dharma-āstikāya and Adharma-āstikāya are both all-pervasive, so they are not discussed here. From the point of view of number, the third chapter considers the Jīva and Ajīva elements from the point of view of number. The consideration of the number of elements was an important topic during the time of Bhagavān Mahāvīra and even after that. On the one hand, according to the Upanishads, the entire universe is the result of a single element, while on the other hand, according to the Sānkhya, there are many Jīvas but only one Ajīva. The Buddhists believe in many minds and many forms. From this point of view, an explanation of the Jain view was necessary. It is done here. Other philosophies only describe the number, while this chapter considers the number from many perspectives. The main focus is on the gradation, i.e., who is less or more than whom, which is discussed in this chapter. First, from the perspective of direction, which direction has more Jīvas and which direction has fewer, similarly, the difference in the number of Jīvas is also considered from the perspective of direction. Similarly, the number of Jīvas is considered in terms of their different types based on their motion, senses, body, yoga, etc., and finally, the number of all the different types of Jīvas is indicated. This not only includes the Jīvas but also the relative number of the six substances, including Dharma-āstikāya, etc. That gradation is explained from the perspective of substance and space. Initially, the number is considered mainly in terms of direction, and later, the number of different types of Jīvas is considered from the perspective of the upper, lower, and horizontal Lokas. Like Jīvas, the number of Pudgalas is also explained in terms of their abundance or scarcity in those directions and in those Lokas. Apart from this, the number of atoms and their number is also considered from both the perspective of substance, space, and substance-space. After that, the number is also explained from the perspective of the understanding of Pudgalas, their temporal existence, and their cycles. This chapter classifies Jīvas in many ways and considers their abundance or scarcity. This list of numbers shows that the efforts made by the Āchāryas in that time to explain the gradation (abundance or scarcity) of the number of Jīvas is commendable. It is stated that the number of women is considered to be more than that of men, whether they are human beings, gods, or Tiryach. In the lower Loka, in the Narakas, the number of Jīvas decreases from the first to the seventh Naraka, i.e., there are the fewest Naraka Jīvas in the seventh Naraka, which is the lowest. The opposite order is 121. Dravya-sangraha Tīkā, Brahmadevakṛta, 10 [37]

Page #1155:
---------------------------
The higher realms have fewer beings than the lower ones. The Saudharma realm has the most, while the Anuttara realms have the least. However, below the human realm (Tiryanchlok) are the Bhavanvasi Devas. Their number is greater than that of the Saudharma Devas. Above them, the Vyantara Devas are even more numerous, and above them, the Jyotishkas are even more numerous than the Vyantaras. Humans have the least number. Therefore, it is natural to consider this existence rare. The fewer the senses, the greater the number of beings. Or, we can say that the number of undeveloped beings is greater than that of developed beings. From time immemorial, the number of Siddha beings who have attained perfection is less than that of the Ekendriya beings. The number of worldly beings always remains greater than that of the Siddhas. Therefore, this realm will never be devoid of worldly beings, because the numbers given in this verse are constant and unchanging. These are the Dhruva numbers. The seventh hell has the fewest Naraka beings compared to other hells, and similarly, the Anuttara Devalok has the fewest beings compared to other Devaloks. This suggests that just as it is difficult to be extremely virtuous, it is also difficult to be extremely sinful. According to the gradual development of beings, the lowest category of beings are Ekendriya. From among the Ekendriya, beings gradually progress and develop. The number of Ekendriya and Siddhas reaches infinity. Prabhavyas are also infinite, and overall, the number of worldly beings is greater than that of Siddhas. This is perfectly logical because in the future, in the Anagatakala, some of the worldly beings will become Siddhas. Therefore, if they were fewer, we would have to assume that the world would become empty. From Ekendriya to Panchendriya, the number of beings decreases gradually. This order remains constant in the Aparayapta beings, but in the Paryapta state, it appears reversed. Why this happens is a matter for contemplation and investigation by the wise. The fourth verse discusses the state of beings, i.e., the Prayu. This verse considers the duration of the state of beings in their Naraka and other forms. Because this verse discusses the duration of their state, it is called the "Sthiti" verse. The Jiva dravya is eternal, but the various forms, Paryayas, and births it takes are impermanent. Therefore, Paryayas are bound to perish. Therefore, it is necessary to consider their state. This is done in the present verse. The verse considers the duration of the lowest and highest lifespans in two ways, focusing only on worldly beings and their distinctions. Siddhas are "Sadiyaa Apjjavassita," meaning they have infinite lifespans, so their lifespan is not considered. The state of the Paryayas of the Ajiv dravya is also not considered here. Because they cannot be confined to a limited time like the lifespan of a Jiva, it is natural to omit them. The present verse first gives a general description of the lifespan of beings based on their common distinctions. Later, it gives a description of their Aparayapta and Paryapta distinctions. For example, first, it describes the lifespan of a general Naraka being, and then it describes the lifespan of a Naraka being [38]

Page #1156:
---------------------------
This is a description of the prevalence of insufficient and then sufficient. In the same order, the lifespan of all types of hell beings, etc., has been considered. From the observation of the list of situations, it is known that the lifespan of a woman is less than that of a man / the lifespan of hell beings and gods is more than that of humans and animals. Among the one-sensed beings, the lifespan of the fire body is the least. This is also experienced in both direct and indirect experience. Because fire extinguishes faster than other beings, the lifespan of the earth body is the longest. The reason why the lifespan of two-sensed to three-sensed beings is less is worth considering. Then the lifespan of four-sensed beings is more, but less than that of two-sensed beings, this is also a mystery and a subject of research. The situation of the non-living is not considered in the present verse / the reason for this seems to be that dharma, adharma and space are eternal and the state of pudgalas is also from one time to countless times, which is described in the fifth verse. Therefore, it was not necessary to instruct it separately. Then, the present verse considers the situation created by the karma of lifespan, and that is not present in the non-living. '22 synonyms: One contemplation is the name of the fifth verse, special word. The word special has two meanings (1) type and (2) synonym / In the first verse, the types, differences and sub-differences of these two substances, living and non-living, have been described, then in these, there is a description of the infinite synonyms of these substances. It has been clarified there that each substance has infinite synonyms, then the whole will also have infinite synonyms and the synonyms of the substance are results, then that substance cannot be eternally stable, but it has to be considered eternally resulting. This information also implies that the nature of the object is in the form of substance and synonym. This verse is named 'vises', but this word is not used in the sutra / the word synonym is used in the entire verse. This word synonym is of special importance in Jain scriptures, therefore there is no difference between synonym or special. Here the word synonym is used in the sense of type or difference and state or result. The word synonym was prevalent in Jain Agamas, but the word 'special' is used in Vaisheshika philosophy, so the use of that word can be in the sense of synonym and also in the sense of difference of the substance of the object - it seems that the Acharya has given the name "vises" to this chapter to tell this. The present verse describes the differences and synonyms in the living and non-living substances. The description of the differences was in the first verse, but there are infinite synonyms in each difference, the information of this fact is the specialty of this fifth verse. In this, 24 Dandakas and 25th Siddha, thus their number and synonyms have been considered. The synonyms of the hell-being, etc., differences of the living substance have been considered from many types and many perspectives. In this, the Jain-approved Anekanta-drishti has been used. In the differences of hell-being, etc., of the living being, which are the synonyms, the consideration has been done from these ten perspectives: substance-ness, region-ness, penetration-ness, situation, black, etc., color, smell, taste, touch, knowledge and perception. The order of consideration is as follows: the question was asked how many synonyms are there of hell beings? In reply, it was said that there are infinite synonyms of hell beings. In this, the differences of number, countless and infinite 122. Pannavanasutra-Introduction Punyavijayaji Maharaj, p. 60

Page #1157:
---------------------------
From different perspectives, there are:

* **From the perspective of substance (dravya)**, the number of hell beings is countable.
* **From the perspective of space (pradesh)**, there are countless spaces, hence countless hell beings.
* **From the perspective of color, smell, knowledge, perception, etc.**, their permutations are infinite.

In this way, this verse clearly explains the permutations of all the hell beings and the liberated souls (siddhas).

Acharya Malayagiri has summarized these ten perspectives into four: substance, space, time, and state.

The essence of substance and space is included in substance, the essence of perception is included in space, the essence of position is included in time, and the essence of color, etc., and knowledge, etc., is included in state.

From the perspective of the 23 substances, except for plants, the remaining 23 hell beings are countless. And from the perspective of the infinite permutations of plants, all 24 hell beings are infinite. The liberated souls are infinite from the perspective of the substance of liberation.

The distinctions made in the first verse regarding non-living things (ajiva) are also present in this verse. The difference is that there they are called "classifications" (prajnapana) and here they are called "permutations."

Here, two distinctions have been made regarding matter (pudgala): atoms and aggregates (skandha). The space of the aggregate (skandhadesh) and the space within the aggregate (skandhapradesh) have been included under the aggregate itself.

The permutations of the non-living things that are shaped (rupi ajiv) are infinite. They have been considered here from the perspective of substance, space, time, and state.

The permutations of atoms, two-spaced aggregates, up to ten-spaced aggregates, and countable-spaced, countless-spaced, and infinite-spaced aggregates are infinite.

From the perspective of position, both atoms and aggregates exist from a position of one or two moments to a position of countless time.

An independent atom does not have a position of infinite time, but an aggregate can have a position of infinite time.

One is inferior, equal, or superior to another in terms of position.

From the perspective of perception, aggregates from two-spaced to infinite-spaced can occupy a space from one space of the sky to countless spaces, but not infinite space, because the matter substance is only in the world-sky (lokaakash), and the spaces of the world-sky are countless. The non-world-sky (alokaakash) is infinite, but there is no existence of matter or any other substance there.

The Nyaya and Vaisheshika schools of thought, which believe in atoms, consider the atom to be eternal and do not believe in its results or permutations.

However, Jainism considers the atom to be eternally changing (parinama-nitya).

Even though the atom is independent, it undergoes changes, as is clear from this verse.

The atom transforms into an aggregate, and the aggregate transforms into an atom, such is the process according to Jainism.

The sixth verse of the reverse order (vyutkrantipad) is about the contemplation of motion and counter-motion (gati and agati). It considers the motion and counter-motion of living beings.

Generally, in all four motions, the least is one moment and the greatest is twelve muhurtas of the time of separation from the state of birth (upapat-virahakal) and the time of separation from the state of death (udvartana-virahakal).

When contemplating the distinctions of those motions, the time of separation from the state of birth and the time of separation from the state of death are the least one moment and the greatest twenty-four muhurtas in the first hell.

In the motion of the liberated soul, there is birth (upapat), but not death (udvartana). Similarly, one should know this in other motions as well.

In the five stationary beings (sthavar), there is continuous birth and death. There is no alternative in this.

After this, there is contemplation on how many living beings are born and die in one moment from hell to liberation.

Along with this, there is discussion on how a living being is born from which state in the distinctions and sub-distinctions of hell beings, etc., and where it goes after death, and when it binds the lifespan of the next life (par-bhav).

Page #1158:
---------------------------
A being takes on a new existence in the same way as its lifespan is bound. There are two types of lifespan: *sopkram* and *nirupkram*. In the case of gods and hell beings, *nirupkram* lifespan is prevalent, as they do not experience accidental death and they bind the lifespan of their next existence six months before the end of their current lifespan. Beings from one-sense to four-sense experience both types of lifespan. In the case of *nirupkram*, they bind the lifespan of their next existence when one-third of their lifespan remains, and in the case of *sopkram*, they bind the lifespan of their next existence when only one *pravali* of lifespan remains, either by dividing their lifespan or by further dividing the division. In the case of five-sense animals and humans, if their lifespan is countless years, they bind their lifespan six months before the end of their lifespan, and if their lifespan is countable years and they have *nirupkram* lifespan, they bind their lifespan when one-third of their lifespan remains. Those with *sopkram* lifespan should be considered similar to one-sense beings. There are six types of lifespan binding: *jati-nam nidhat-payu-nam*, *gati-nam*, *sthi-ti-nam*, *avgahana-nam*, *pradesh-nam*, and *anubhava-nam* nidhat. In all of these, *ayukarma* is the primary factor, and its arising leads to the arising of the corresponding *jati* and other karmas. The seventh chapter discusses the duration of breath for all beings in the world except for the liberated ones. Acharya Malayagiri has written that the more suffering there is, the more breaths there are, and those who are extremely suffering have a continuous process of breathing. The more happiness there is, the longer the intervals between breaths, which is a matter of experience. The act of breathing itself is suffering. In the case of gods, the more their position, the more intervals there are between their breaths. This is explained in detail. The 27th chapter discusses the consciousness of beings. Consciousness is of ten types: *pahar*, *bhay*, *maithun*, *parigraha*, *krodha*, *man*, *maya*, *lobha*, *lok*, and *ogh*. These types of consciousness are considered in relation to the 24 *dandakas*, and the small number of beings with consciousness is also considered. In hell, *bhay-sanjna* is prevalent, in *tirthach*, *prahar-sanjna* is prevalent, in humans, *maithun-sanjna* is prevalent, and in gods, *parigraha-sanjna* is prevalent. The ninth chapter is called *yonipad*. When a being's lifespan is complete in one existence, it departs with its karmic and luminous bodies. It takes on new bodies, suitable for its new birth, in the place of birth, such as *oudarik* and other bodies. This place is called *yoni* or the place of origin. This chapter discusses *yoni* from various perspectives. There are nine types of *yoni-sthan* or places of origin for beings: cold, hot, warm, conscious, unconscious, mixed, closed, open, and closed-open. All of these are explained in detail. The tenth chapter discusses the ultimate and non-ultimate aspects of substances. In the creation of the world, some things are at the end of the ultimate, while others are not at the end of the ultimate but in the middle. This chapter discusses the ultimate and non-ultimate aspects of various substances in relation to the world and the non-world. The concept of ultimate and non-ultimate is only possible in relation to something else. This chapter asks six types of questions: 1. Is it ultimate? 2. Is it non-ultimate? 3. Are they ultimate (plural)?

Page #1159:
---------------------------
4. Acharam are, 5. Darmanta Pradesh are, 6. Acharamanta Pradesh are. These six options have been considered from the perspective of Pratyadi Drishti in the lives of 24 Dandakas. For example, with respect to motion, Charam is said to be that which, without going to any other motion, is going directly to Moksha from the human motion. But not all those who are in human motion go to Moksha, therefore all those who have remaining Bhavas are Acharam with respect to motion. Similarly, Charam-Acharam has been considered from the perspective of position etc. Language: In the eleventh chapter of Chintan, while contemplating about language, it has been explained how language is born, where it resides, what is its nature? Along with that, light has been shed on its form-differences-sub-differences, the person speaking, the dawn, various important questions. What is spoken is language. In other words, what is the cause of understanding-understanding for others is language. Language has a significant contribution in the cultural development of mankind. Language is a convenient medium for the exchange of ideas. Language is made up of words and words are descriptive. Therefore, for the fundamental idea of language, it is necessary to consider the letters, because language is inseparable from letters and words. Indian philosophers have done serious contemplation regarding the word. What is a word? What is its basic element? How is it born? How is it expressed? And how does it reach the ears of the listeners? Kanad etc. many philosophers consider the word not as a substance but as a quality of Akash. Their opinion is that the word is not Podgalik because there is an effect of touch in its basis. The word is a quality of Akash, therefore only the Akash of the word can be considered. Akash is devoid of touch, therefore its quality word is also devoid of touch and what is devoid of touch is not Pudgal. The second thing is that Pudgal is shaped. Being shaped, it is gross, a gross object can neither enter nor exit any dense object. If the word were Pudgal, then it would also be gross, but the word breaks through the wall and comes out. Therefore, it is not shaped and not being shaped, it is not Pudgal either. The third reason is that the Podgalik substance is visible even before it is born and even after it is destroyed. For example, the soil is visible before the pot is made and the pieces of the pot are also visible after the pot is destroyed. In this way, the previous and subsequent forms of every Podgalik substance are visible. But neither the previous form of the word is visible nor the subsequent one. In such a situation, the word should not be considered as Pudgal. The fourth thing is that Podgalik substances motivate other Podgalik substances. If the word were Pudgal, then it would also motivate other Pudgals. But it does not motivate other Pudgals, therefore the word cannot be considered as Podgalik. Fifth reason- The word is a quality of Akash, Akash itself is not Pudgal, therefore its quality-word cannot be Pudgal. We will contemplate from the Jain perspective regarding the arguments presented in the Mimamsa philosophy. In Mimamsa philosophy, the basis of the word has been considered to be devoid of touch, but in reality, the basis of the word is not devoid of touch but is touchful. The basis of the word is Bhashavarna and there is definitely touch in Bhashavarna. Therefore, since the basis of the word is touchful, the word is also touchful and being touchful, it is Pudgal. Here, this natural curiosity may arise that if there is touch in the word,

Page #1160:
---------------------------
If we touch something, we should feel the touch. We hear words, but words are not touchable. How can words be considered touchable in such a situation? The answer is that it is not possible to make a rule that whatever we experience must have an effect. There are many things that we do not experience, but their existence is accepted through inference and other proofs. For example, atoms are not visible, but they exist. The second question might be, if there is touch in words, why don't we feel it? The solution is that touch is present in words, but it is latent. Just as we experience the smell from a fragrant substance, but we do not experience touch in it because it is latent. Similarly, the touch of words is also latent. 

Again, one might wonder how to ascertain that there is touch in words. The solution is that when a favorable wind blows, sound can be heard even from a distance. When an unfavorable wind blows, even if one is close, words are not clearly heard. This clearly shows that a favorable wind helps in the transmission of words, while an unfavorable wind resists it. If words were touchless, then wind would have no effect on them. Therefore, words are material, they have touch, and because they have touch, they are made of pudgala.

The second argument was that words pass through walls and come out, so they are not pudgala. The answer is that there are small holes in doors and windows through which words come out. If there were no holes at all, words would not be able to come out. If the door is open, it is clearly heard, and if the door is closed, it is unclear. Therefore, words are gross like smell, and because they are gross, they are pudgalic.

The third argument is that pudgala is not visible before it is created and after it is destroyed. The answer is that just as electricity is not visible before it is generated and after it is destroyed, its subsequent form is not visible, yet electricity is still pudgalic. So what is the obstacle in considering words to be pudgalic?

The fourth argument is that if words were pudgala, they would surely induce other pudgalas. In response, we would say that there are many substances like subtle dust, smoke, etc., which, despite being pudgalic, do not induce others. This does not pose any obstacle to their being pudgala. The same is the case with words.

The fifth argument was that words are a quality of space, but words are not actually a quality of space, but a synonym of pudgala substance. If words were a quality of space, they could not be perceived directly. Since space is not directly perceived, how can its quality be directly perceived? Words are directly perceived through the auditory sense, so they are not a quality of space. Whatever is the object of the sense is pudgalic, like a pot, a cloth, etc.

From the above discussion, it is clear that words are pudgala. This pudgalic word has an inherent power due to which the knowledge of objects arises. Every word has the power to convey the knowledge of all objects in the world. The word 'pot' signifies a pot, but it can also signify a cloth, etc. But humans have imagined different symbols and focused its vast speaking power. Therefore, in which country and in which time, for which object, whatever word is fixed, it conveys the knowledge of that object. Take the word 'cow' as an example. If the meaning of 'cow' is assumed to be all objects in the world, then a person will understand any object from it. To avoid this confusion, the comprehensive [43]

Page #1161:
---------------------------
It is necessary to limit the power of the speaker to a single substance, so that it can convey the knowledge of one substance / convey the knowledge of a fixed meaning / Language is created from the pudgals of the word category. The atoms of the word category are spread throughout the entire lokaakasha. When the speaker wants to speak, he takes those pudgals, those pudgals are transformed into the form of words and reach the lokaanta at one time. Their speed of motion is very fast. There are categories of regions of the prakasha dravya. Those categories exist in all six directions: east, west, north, south, up, down / When the speaker uses language, the words are spread from those categories. In the time of four moments, the word spreads throughout the entire lokaakasha. If the listener is in the same category of language, then he hears the language spoken by the speaker or the word of the instrument like a drum in a mixed form. If the listener is in a different category, then he hears the infused word. The listener does not only hear the word spoken by the speaker, but also the mixed words formed by the spoken word dravya and the word dravya infused by those word dravya. The listener in the same category hears those mixed word dravya. The listener in a different category does not even hear the mixed word. He only hears the words infused by the original spoken words. The meaning of the infused word is that the pudgals of the word category in the middle are transformed into the form of words from the dravya abandoned by the speaker in the form of words or from the sound of a drum etc. The word spreads according to the category, it does not go into a different category. The word dravya is so subtle that even the obstruction of a wall etc. cannot take it into a different category. Here, it is natural to have this curiosity that the word reaches the lokaanta according to the category in one moment. In the second moment, it also goes to Vidisha and in four moments it spreads throughout the entire loka. In such a situation, why does the listener not hear the mixed word when he is in Vidisha? The answer is that it takes only one moment for the language to be digested in the lokaanta and in the second moment, the language is no longer language. Because it has been said that the language is called language in the time in which it is spoken, in the second moment the language becomes non-language. 30 / Therefore, the word that is heard in Vidisha becomes two, three, four etc. moments old, due to which it becomes devoid of the power of hearing. It transforms other pudgals of the word category into the form of language. Therefore, it is an infused word and infused words are not heard in Vidisha. For example, where a stone falls in a pond, a wave spreads around it. That wave reaches the end of the reservoir, generating other waves. In the same way, when the language dravya used by the speaker moves forward, it transforms other language-worthy dravya present in the sky into the form of language and reaches the end of the loka. When it reaches the end of the loka, the power of hearing in it is exhausted. It produces the transformation of other pudgals of the word category into the form of words and those words are in motion, inspired by the original and the middle words. In this way, the entire lokaakasha is filled with those words in four moments. Through kayayoga, the jiva takes the dravya of the word category and through vachanayoga, it abandons it. The process of taking and abandoning continues. Sometimes the jiva 130. The language spoken by a human being, after the time of language, is not language / 131.

It takes in language-matter and also sometimes abandons it moment by moment / It abandons the language-matter taken in the first time in the second time and abandons the matter taken in the second time in the third time / Only a being with an Audārika, Vaikriya and Pāhārika body takes in language-matter. Many thinkers believe that Brahman is verbal. The entire vast universe is verbal, there is no existence of external substances like components and parts and internal substances like knowledge etc. apart from words. Words appear in the form of different objects. But this thinking is hindered by evidence. We have already supported the pudgalic nature of words on the previous pages / This truth has also been revealed through modern scientific instruments / The instrument itself is in the form of pudgal, therefore it is able to catch pudgal. Only a pudgalic object can catch a pudgalic object. When the pudgal of language comes out in the form of language, it pervades the entire world. The structure of the world is diamond-shaped, therefore the shape of language is also said to be diamond-shaped. The pudgal of language does not go beyond the world, because the action of going is in the world itself, which is the support of the dharma-astikāya. Pudgal is in the form of an infinite-region skandha from the pudgal atom. The skandha which are infinite-region are useful for the reception of language. From the point of view of the field, the skandha located in countless regions, from the point of view of time, are in the state from one time to countless times / From the point of view of form, taste, smell and touch, the pudgal of language are not the same, but all of them have form etc. results. From the point of view of touch, only the pudgal with four touches are taken. The soul takes in the pudgal of language that are present in as many regions as it is aware of the regions of the sky. In the present verse, the differences of language have been described from many points of view. There are two types of language, sufficient and insufficient. There are two types of sufficient, satyabhasa and mrishābhasa, and there are ten types of satyabhasa - janapadasatya, sammatasatya, sthapanasatya, namasatya, rupasatya, pratitiyasatya, vyavharasatya, bhavasatya, yogasatya, praupamyasatya. There are many reasons for speaking false language. There are ten types of false language - krodhanisrit, mananisrit, mayanisrit, lobhanisrit, premanisrit, dveshanisrit, hasyanisrit, bhayannisrit, prakyanikanisrit, upghatanisrit / There are two types of insufficient language, satyampa and asatyamusha. Ten types of satyamusha and twelve types of asatyamrusha have been mentioned. Satyamrusha language is that which is half true and asatyamrusha is that in which there is no use of truth and falsehood. From another point of view, sixteen types of language have been mentioned from the point of view of gender, number, tense, voice etc. Body: In the twelfth verse, a thought has been made about the body of beings. There are five types of body, Audārika, Vaikriya, Prāhārika, Tejas and Karmāṇa. 3. The Upanishads discuss five sheaths of the soul. They are 132. Bhagavati Sutra 1711 Sutra 592 [45]

1. Annamaya Kosha (Gross body, which is made of food) 2. Pranamaya Kosha (Air element within the body) 3. Manomaya Kosha (Mental activity of determination and choice) 4. Vijnanamaya Kosha (Discriminative activity of intellect) 5. Anandamaya Kosha (State of bliss) 1933 Only Annamaya Kosha can be compared to the Audarik body among these five Koshas. 34 Audarik etc. bodies are gross, while Karman body is a subtle body. The origin of the gross body is due to the Karman body. Naiyayikas have also called the Karman body the Avyakt body. 35 The subtle and Linga bodies considered in Sankhya etc. philosophies can be compared to the Karman body. It has been explained by contemplating how many bodies are there in twenty-four Dandakas that even though the number of regions of the bodies from Audarik to Vaikriya and from Vaikriya to Aharak is more, they are more and more subtle.  /  In short, the Audarik body is a gross body made of Ras etc. Dhatus originating from Pudgalas. This body is found only in humans and Tiryanchas.  /  Vaikriya body is the one that is capable of taking various forms, this body is found in Nairyayikas and Devas. It is also found in humans and Tiryanchas who are endowed with Vaikriya Labdhi and in Vayukaya.  /  Aharak body is the one that originates from a special Labdhi called Aharak.  /  Tejas body is the one from which Tejo Labdhi is obtained, by which one can inflict harm or grace, by which there is brilliance and digestion. Karman body is the one that originates from the group of Karmas, in other words, Karman Vikar can be called Karman body. Tejas and Karman bodies are found in all worldly beings. Bhava Parinaman: A contemplation is about Parinaman in the thirteenth Parinaman Pada. In Indian philosophies, some philosophies like Sankhya etc. are Parinamanvadi, while some philosophies like Nyaya etc. do not accept Parinamanvad. Those philosophies that have accepted the non-duality of Dharma and Dharmi are Parinamanvadi, and those philosophies that have considered a great difference between Dharma and Dharmi are Aparinamanvadi.  /  Regarding Nityata, there are three types of views in Indian philosophies - Sankhya, Jain and Ramanuj in Vedanta.  /  All three have accepted Parinami-Nityata. But it must be remembered here that Sankhya Darshan has considered Parinami-Nityata in Prakriti, but has accepted Kutasthanityata in Purusha. Naiyayikas have considered Kutasthanityata in all types of Nitya Vastyus. Due to accepting a great difference between Dharma and Dharmi, Parinami-Nityata 133.

They did not accept the principle. Buddhists have accepted impermanence. Even after accepting impermanence, they have accepted rebirth. They have accepted the third type of eternity as the eternal nature of progeny. In the presented verse of Prajnapana, the results of both the living being and the non-living being have been presented from the Jain perspective. This makes it clear that the Sankhya philosophy, which is considered valid by the Purushakatasthavada, is invalid for the Jains. First, the differences in the results of the living being have been presented, and then the results in the twenty-four punishments like hell, etc. have been considered. After that, the results of the non-living being have been counted. Here, it is particularly noteworthy that only the results of the pudgala have been discussed in the non-living being. There is no discussion of the results of the formless non-living substances like Dharmastikaya, Adharmastikaya, etc. Punyavijayaji Maharaj, who is influenced by the Agamas, and Pandit Dalsukh Malvasiya, etc., have discussed this in detail in the introduction of Prajnapana. That discussion is enlightening, therefore, we do not repeat that discussion here and suggest that those who are particularly curious should read it. Here, the meaning of the result is the synonym or the evolution of the states. Kshaya: The name of the fourteenth verse of contemplation is Kshaya Pada. Kshaya is a technical term of Janadarshan. Kshaya is that which creates impurity in the pure use of the soul. The meaning of Kshaya is to scrape, dig, and cultivate. Kshaya is that which makes the cultivation of karma flourish. As soon as Kshaya ripens, the fruits in the form of happiness and sorrow come out. The word Kshaya is also indicative of the bitter taste. Just as the consumption of a substance rich in bitter taste reduces appetite, similarly, the desire for liberation gradually decreases in beings dominated by Kshaya. Kshaya is that which destroys equality, peace, and balance. Kshaya is a kind of vibration, heat, and force, which keeps creating disturbance in the use of contemplation. Anger, pride, deceit, and greed, all four of these can be said in one word, that is Kshaya. Kshaya is the intoxication of the mind. Kshaya has been compared to the cycle, but the cycle of anger is different from the cycle of pride, and the cycle of pride is different from the cycle of deceit. The cycle of anger is Kharaavarta. Kharaavarta is similar to the sharp cycle that occurs in the ocean. The cycle of pride is Unnataavarta. The state of mind motivated by this cycle is similar to the strong wind that blows away the top of the mountain in its flow. The proud person feels the existence of himself by destroying others. Maya is similar to Gudaavarta. The mind of the deceitful is winding. His thoughts are hidden, he hides his thoughts. Greed is Abhishavaavarta, the mind of the greedy revolves around one center, like eagles and other birds revolve around meat, until he gets that substance, there is no peace in his mind. In this way, Kshaya is circular, which keeps rotating consciousness. In the presented verse, these four Kshayas, anger, pride, deceit, and greed, have been mentioned in the twenty-four punishments. Kshaya arises in all worldly beings due to field, object, R, and epithet. How many times does the living being get the cause of Kshaya and how many times does Kshaya arise without a cause. 138.

There are infinite levels of intensity for all four *kṣayās*, however, from the perspective of the destruction of *ātma-vikāsa*, there are four levels for each: *ananta-anubandhī*, *apratyākyāna-āvaraṇa*, *pratyākyāna-āvaraṇa*, and *sanjvalana*. 

* *Ananta-anubandhī* *kṣayā* does not allow the attainment of *samyag-darśana* during its arising. 
* *Apratyākyāna-āvaraṇa* *kṣayā* does not allow the attainment of the ability to observe *vratas* during its arising. 
* *Pratyākyāna-āvaraṇa* *kṣayā* does not allow the attainment of the ability to observe *mahā-vratas* during its arising. 
* *Sanjvalana* *kṣayā* does not allow the arising of *vītarāgatā* during its arising. 

These four types of *kṣayās* are progressively milder, and are also categorized as *prābhōga-nirvartita* and *anābhōga-nirvartita*, *upaśānta* and *anupaśānta*. *Prābhōga-nirvartita* *kṣayā* arises due to a present cause, while that which arises without a cause is called *anābhōga-nirvartita*. 

*Kṣayā* is the main cause of *karma-bandhana*. In all three *kālas*, *kṣayā* is considered the cause of the selection of *karma-prakṛtis* and their location and type, and in the 24 *daṇḍaka* beings. *Kṣayā* is also considered the main cause of *upacaya*, *bandha*, *udīraṇa*, *vedanā*, and *nirjarā*.

**Indriyas:** In the 15th *pada* of *chintana*, two objectives are considered in relation to *indriyas*. The *indriya* is the mark that draws the line between *prāṇī* and *aprāṇī*. In *Sarvārtha-siddhī*, Ācārya Pūjyapāda defines the word *indriya* as follows: "The *ātma* that attains supreme *aiśvarya* is called *indra*, and the *liṅga* or mark of that *indra* is called *indriya*." Or, "That which is instrumental in the attainment of *artha* for the *jīva* is *indriya*." Or, "That which is the cause of the attainment of the well-being of the *indriya-tīta* *ātma* is *indriya*." Or, "The *indriya* is that which is created by *nāma-karma*, such as *sparśana* etc." Similar definitions are found in many other texts, such as *Tattvārtha-bhāṣya*, *Tattvārtha-vārttika*, *Āvश्यक-niyukti*, etc. 

The implication is that due to the covering of *karma* on the natural power of the *ātma*, knowledge cannot be directly obtained from the *ātma*, therefore a medium is required, and that medium is the *indriya*. Therefore, that which helps in the attainment of knowledge is *indriya*. 

There are five *indriyas*: *sparśana*, *rasana*, *prāṇa*, *chaśru*, and *śrōtra*. Their objects are also five: *sparśa*, *rasa*, *gandha*, *rūpa*, and *śabda*. Therefore, *indriya* is called *pratinīyat-artha-grāhī*. 

Each *indriya* is of two types: *dravya-indriya* and *bhāva-indriya*. The specific form of *pudgala* is *dravya-indriya*, and the result of *pāśma* is *bhāva-indriya*. There are two divisions of *dravya-indriya*: *nivṛtti* and *upakarana*.

The specific natures of the senses are the *nirvutti-dravyaindriya*. The *nirvutti-dravyaindriya* has external and internal *pudgalik* power, without which knowledge is not possible even if the nature exists; that instrument is the *dravyaindriya*. The *bhaavendriya* is also of two types, acquisition and use.47 The special power of the soul that is obtained from the destruction and pacification of *jnaanavaranakarma* etc. is acquisition. When acquisition is obtained, the soul performs a special type of business, that business is use. The first motivator has twenty-four doors and the second has twelve doors. The senses have been discussed in twenty-four *dandakas*. In living beings, the *avagrahan-paricched*, *avaay*, *eeha*, and *avagraha-artha* and *vyanjan* have been described in twenty-four *dandakas* in both ways. Except for the eye sense, the remaining four senses have *vyanjanavagraha*. The *arthaavagraha* is of six types. It happens through the five senses and also through the sixth sense, the mind. Thus, the senses have been divided into two categories: *dravyaindriya* and *bhaavendriya*. The *dravyaindriya* is material in nature because it is *pudgalajanya*, and the *bhaavendriya* is knowledge-like. Therefore, it is synonymous with the power of consciousness. The *dravyaindriya* is obtained from the rise of *angopanga* and *nirmanakarma*. The shape of the senses is called *nirvutti*. That *nirvutti* is also of two types: external and internal. The external shape of the sense is called *baahyanirvutti*, and the internal nature is called *praabhyantaranirvutti*. The external part is like a sword, and the internal part is like the sharp edge of a sword, which is made of very pure atoms. In the commentary of *Prajnaapana*, the nature of *praabhyantaranirvutti* is described as *pudgalmaya*.48 But in the *Aachaaraanga-vritti*, its nature is described as *chetanmaya*.149 Here it must be remembered that the nature of the skin is of various types, but there is no separation in its external and internal shape. The external shape of the animal's skin is the same as its internal shape, but this is not the case with the other four senses. Their external shape is different, and their internal shape is different. For example, the internal shape of the ear is like a *kadambapushpa*. The internal shape of the eye is like a lentil seed, and the internal shape of the nose is like a *pratimuktak* flower, and the shape of the tongue is like a knife. But the external shape is visible in all of them. For example, we can see the ears, eyes, nose, and tongue of humans, elephants, horses, birds, etc. The power of the *praabhyantaranirvutti* to grasp the object is the *upakaranaindriya*. The *Tattvarthasutra*, 50 *Visheshaavashakabhaashya*,51 *Lokaprakash*, 52 and other texts have discussed the senses in detail. In *Prajnaapana*, the *dravyaindriya* and *bhaavendriya* have been discussed in twenty-four *dandakas* through the doors of *indriyopachay*, *indriyanirvartan*, *indriyalabdhi*, *indriyopयोग* etc. 147. *Labdhyupyogau bhaavendriyam* / *Tattvarthasutra* 2/18 148 *Prajnaapanasutra*, *Indriyapad*, Commentary page 294/1 149. *Praachaaraangavritti*, page 104 150. *Tattvarthasutra*, Chapter 2, Sutra 17/18 and various commentaries 151. *Visheshaavashakabhaashya*, Verse 2993-3003 152. *Lokaprakash*, Canto 3, Verse 464 onwards

## Experiment: A Contemplation

Experiment is the sixteenth term of contemplation. The activity of the soul through mind, speech, and body is called yoga, and the same yoga is described in this term by the word "experiment." This is called soul activity because the three cannot act without the influence of the soul. Acharya Akalankdev has explained it by stating the external and internal causes of all three yogas. In short, it is as follows:

The soul's प्रदेशपरिस्पन्दन (interaction with the field) towards contemplation due to external and internal causes is called मनोयोग (mind yoga). The support of मनोवर्गणा (mind-forming matter) is the external cause. The destruction and cessation of वीर्यान्तरायकर्म (hindering karma) and the destruction and cessation of नोइन्द्रियावरणकर्म (obscuring karma of the senses) are its internal causes.

The soul's प्रदेशपरिस्पन्दन towards speech due to external and internal causes is called वचनयोग (speech yoga). The support of वचनवर्गणा (speech-forming matter) is the external cause, and the destruction and cessation of वीर्यान्तरायकर्म and the destruction and cessation of मतिज्ञानावरण (obscuring karma of knowledge) and अक्षरश्रुतज्ञानावरण (obscuring karma of scriptural knowledge) etc. are its internal causes.

The soul's प्रदेशपरिस्पन्दन towards movement and other objects due to external and internal causes is called काययोग (body yoga). The support of any kind of शरीरवर्गणा (body-forming matter) is its external cause. The destruction and cessation of वीर्यान्तरायकर्म is its internal cause.

Here, it should be remembered that in the thirteenth and fourteenth गुणस्थान (stages of spiritual progress), the destruction of वीर्यान्तरायकर्म, which is the internal cause, is the same in both गुणस्थान, but the external cause, which is the support of वर्गणा, is not the same. Therefore, in the thirteenth गुणस्थान, there is योगविधि (method of yoga), but not in the fourteenth.

A question arises here: In मनोयोग and वचनयोग, there is always some kind of support of काययोग. Therefore, it is sufficient to accept only one काययोग. In response, it is said that in मनोयोग and वचनयोग, काययोग is dominant. When काययोग helps in contemplation, it is मनोयोग, and when काययोग helps in speaking, it is called वचनयोग. From a practical point of view, these are the three types of काययोग.

Those पुद्गल (particles of matter) that are fit to become mind, which are called मनोवर्गणा पुद्गल, when they transform into mind, they are called द्रव्य-मन (material mind). According to the Shvetambar tradition, द्रव्यमन does not have a specific location in the body; it is spread throughout the body. According to the Digambar tradition, the location of द्रव्यमन is the heart, and its shape is like a lotus.

When भाषावर्गणा पुद्गल (speech-forming matter) transform into speech, they are called वचन (speech). The yoga that arises from the पुद्गल of औदारिक (generous) and बैंक्रिय (banker) etc. शरीरवर्गणा (body-forming matter) is...

Thus, there are three types of yoga due to the difference in support. From a Jain perspective, mind, speech, and body are all made of पुद्गल, and the natural movement of पुद्गल can occur even without the soul. But when पुद्गल transforms into mind, speech, and body, the specific type of activity that occurs with the help of the soul is impossible in the untransformed state. The transformation of पुद्गल into mind etc. is also dependent on the karma of the soul. Therefore, its activity is called soul activity.

Fifteen types of use of mind, speech, and body have been described, which are as follows:

Karman-kayaprayoga  /  In the commentary on Prajnapanatika, Acharya Malayagiri has discussed the Tejas-karman-sharira-prayoga by combining Tejas with Karman, as the Tejas-kaya-yoga is indicated in these fifteen types of prayoga. '55 These fifteen prayogas have been planned in the jiva and especially in the twenty-four dandakas. After the discussion of prayoga, this pada also describes the motion-fall. Its five types have been mentioned: prayoga-gati, tat-gati, bandhan-chhedan-gati, upapat-gati and vihayo-gati  /  These also have many sub-types. Leshya: The seventeenth pada is an analysis of Leshya. Leshya is a type of pudgalic environment. The jiva and pudgal are affected by each other. There are many groups of pudgals that affect the jiva. One of these groups is called Leshya. In the Brihadvritti of Uttaradhyayanasutra, the meaning of Leshya has been given as atomic radiance, lustre, brilliance or shadow. '56 Acharya Shivary of the Digambara tradition has called Leshya that which is affected by the shadow pudgals of the jiva's result. '57 In ancient Jain literature, the word Leshya is used for all three things: the colour of the body, the atomic radiance and the thoughts affected by it. The colour of the body and the atomic radiance are dravya-leshya, while the thoughts are bhava-leshya. 58 Different definitions of Leshya are found in different texts. In the ancient Panchasangraha, 10 Dhavala,' Gommatasar etc., it is written that Leshya is that by which the jiva gets entangled in punya-papa. According to Tattvarthavartika, 113 Panchastikaya 54 etc., Leshya is the tendency of the yogas that are influenced by the arising of kshaya. In the Sthananga-Abhaydevavritti, '65 Dhyanashataka, 6 etc., it is written that Leshya is that by which the being performs karma. 155. Prajnapanatika patra 319  Acharya Malayagiri 156.

It is called Leshya, which is connected with it / Leshya is the result of the living being with the help of substances like Krishna etc. Yoga result is Leshya / According to the appropriate definitions, Leshya is related to the living being and the Pudgalas of Karma, the state of Karma is fulfilled and Karma arises. Leshya is related to the purity and impurity of the soul. The Pudgalic Leshya affects the thoughts of the mind and the thoughts of the mind affect the Leshya / The type of Leshya will be the same mental culmination. Many great thinkers believe that the calmness of Kshaya leads to purity in Adhyavasaya and the purity of Madhyavasaya leads to the purity of Leshya. According to the definition according to which Yogapravritti is Leshya, from that point of view, there is harmony of Bhavaleshya up to the thirteenth Gunasthan and according to the definition according to which Kshayoday-Anuranjit Yogapravritti is Leshya, from that point of view, Leshya is only up to the tenth Gunasthan. These two definitions are not against each other because they are relative. Where Yogapravritti is called Leshya, there the results of Prakriti and Pradeshbandh are intended as Leshya and where the tendency of Yoga, which is influenced by Kshayoday, is called Leshya, there the results of the four bonds of state, section, etc. are intended as Leshya. There are six motivators in this verse / The first motivator describes food, body, breathing, karma, color, Leshya, pain, action, lifespan, etc. in relation to the twenty-four Dandakas like Narak. The Narak living beings whose bodies are large, they also have more food, etc. The size of the Narakas increases progressively. Compared to the first hell, the second hell is bigger and the third hell is bigger than the second. But the opposite is the case with the Devas. There, the size decreases progressively and so does the amount of food. Having more food is only the cause of suffering. A sad person eats more, a happy person eats less / There is a discussion of even-odd food, etc. in the twenty-four Dandakas like Narak, compared to the Leshya living beings. The second motivator explains in detail how many Leshyas are there in the living beings of the four movements like Narak, etc., by telling the six types of Leshya, Krishna, Neel, Kapota, Tej, Padma, Shukla / From the point of view of expectation, the thought of the smallness of Leshya is also done in it. Along with this, light has been shed on the relationship of the smallness and greatness of the increase in relation to Leshya, taking the living beings of the 24 Dandakas. The third motivator discusses Leshya related to birth and death time. Light has also been shed on the subject-limit of the knowledge of the living beings with such and such Leshya. The fourth motivator discusses in detail how the color, taste, smell, touch of a Leshya changes when it transforms into another Leshya. Various results of Leshyas, their regions, size, area, and place -~-Mularadhana 131911 167. Uttaradhyayanasutra Brihadvatti Patra 650 168.

The text discusses the concept of *leshya* (karmic tendencies) in relation to *dravya* (substance) and *pradesh* (space). The fifth *uddeshaka* (chapter) states that a *leshya* does not transform into another *leshya* in terms of the *dev* (heavenly beings) and *narak* (hellish beings). The sixth *uddeshaka* contemplates the *leshya* of humans in various realms. It is important to remember that the *leshya* of parents does not necessarily determine the *leshya* of their children. A being receives a *leshya* and after the *antam hart* (final lifespan) is over, and the *antar mahart* (remaining lifespan) remains, the being takes birth in the next world. This is because at the time of death, the *leshya* of the next birth must be present, and at the time of birth, the *leshya* must remain until the *antar mahart* is over. The being is born in the same *leshya* in which it died. The 70th *Uttaraadhyayana* (text) describes the types of *adhyavasaya* (resolutions) of beings with different *leshyas*. The *Bhagawti* (text) differentiates the *dravya* (substance) and *bhav* (state) of *leshyas*. Although the *leshya* section of the *Prajnapan* (text) is extensive, it lacks definitions and descriptions of *dravya*, *bhav*, etc. Regarding this deficiency, *Pagam Prabhavak* Punyavijayji Maharaj believes that it is a sign of the text's antiquity. The 18th chapter of the *Prajnapan* is called *Kayasthiti* (state of the body). It contemplates how long both the *jiva* (soul) and *ajiva* (non-soul) remain in their respective states. The difference between the fourth chapter (*Sthitipad*) and this chapter is that the *Sthitipad* considers the lifespan of beings in 24 *dandakas* (periods) in relation to one birth, while this chapter considers the total lifespan of all births in a continuous cycle where a being is reborn in the same state after death. It also considers the duration of *ajiva* substances like *dharmaastikaya*, *adharmaastikaya*, *pudgalastikaya*, etc., which are known as *kaya* (body). The chapter describes *kayasthiti* in relation to *jiva*, *mati* (mind), *indriya* (senses), *kaya* (body), *yoga* (union), *ved* (knowledge), *kashaya* (passions), *leshya* (karmic tendencies), *samyaktv* (right faith), *gyan* (knowledge), *darshan* (perception), *sanyat* (self-control), *upayog* (use), *prahar* (food), *bhashak* (speech), *paritt* (protection), *paryapt* (sufficiency), *sukshma* (subtle), *sanjni* (consciousness), *bhav* (state of being), *asti* (existence), *charim* (final). The *kayasthiti* of plants is described as "asankhejjya poggal pariyatta," meaning that no plant being can remain in the plant form for an infinite time. It implies that the being must have experienced other births besides the plant form. This clarifies that the concept of *vyavahar rashi* (practical amount) and *avyavahar rashi* (impractical amount) did not exist during the time of Acharya Shyam, the author of the *Prajnapan*. The concept of *vyavahar rashi* and *avyavahar rashi* emerged during the philosophical era. This is why the commentary on the *Prajnapan* differentiates between *vyavahar rashi* and *avyavahar rashi* in relation to plants and describes the nature of beings in *nigoda* (hell). The commentary mentions that the *jiva* of Mata Marudevi was in the plant form for an infinite time. This chapter discusses many important topics. The commentator Malayagiri has clarified many points in the commentary that were implied in the original text. 170. *Jallesaai Dambai Ayiitta Kal Karei, Tallesesu Uvvajjai* / 171. *Prajnapan Tika Patra 379 / 385 [ 53 ]*

The nineteenth principle is about the twenty-four categories of beings. It discusses the relationship between Samyagdristi, Mithyadristi and Mishradristi in these categories. It states that Samyag-Mithyarashti is only Panchendriya and Ekendriya Mithyashti is the only one. From Dwiendriya to Chaturindriya, there is no Samyag Mithyadristi. In Shatkhandagam, Asangyi Panchendriya is called Mithyarashti. Samyagdristi and Mithyarashti exist from Dwiendriya to Panchendriya. Samyaktva means faith in the soul from the perspective of knowledge and faith in the body and other beings from the perspective of action. 

There are nine substances like Jiva and Ajiva. The faith in these ultimate substances, arising from teachings or nature, should be understood as Samyaktva. 

The twentieth principle is called Antakriya. When a being dies, its gross body remains here, but the subtle bodies, Taijas and Karman, remain with it. The gross body is then produced again through the Karman body. Therefore, even after the gross body is shed, the cycle of birth and death does not end because the subtle body remains. When the subtle bodies are destroyed, the cycle of existence also ends. Antakriya means the end of the cycle of birth and death. The action that ends existence is Antakriya. This action is used in two senses: new existence or liberation, in other words, here the word Antakriya is used in both the sense of liberation and death. 

In the Stananga, the Antakriya of Bharat, Gajasukumal, Sanatkumar and Mata Marudevi is described as the action of ending birth and death and attaining liberation. They became inactive by ending the actions arising from the soul and body. 

This principle discusses Antakriya in the context of the twenty-four categories of beings. It also states that only humans can attain Antakriya, or liberation. This is described through ten gates. 

The twenty-first principle is called Avgahana Sansthanapad. This principle discusses the body of beings through seven gates: the types of bodies, the nature of the institution, the measurement of the proof body, the selection of pudgals for body formation, which bodies are present in a being at the same time, the abundance and scarcity of the substances and regions of the body, and the abundance and scarcity of Avgahana. 

The discussion of beings has been done through many gates like motion, etc., but there is no body gate in them. Here, in the first method gate, after describing the five types of bodies - Praudarik, Vaikriya, Aharak, Taijas and Karman, there is a discussion of the types of these bodies. Which institution is there in Ekendriya, etc., who have Praudarik body? How much is their Avgahana? How many bodies are possible in a being at the same time? There is a detailed discussion about the abundance and scarcity of the substances and regions of the body, the abundance and scarcity of the Avgahana of the body. 

172. The understanding of the soul and other beings is considered correct by the Jinas. It is considered correct from the perspective of action and knowledge of the self. 

173. The soul, non-soul, bondage, merit, demerit, and defilement are all there. Restraint, knowledge, liberation, and faith are also nine. 

The nature of these states is the basis of understanding. The understanding of the one who understands these states is considered correct.

**Action: A Contemplation**

"Kriya" is a verb. In ancient times, the word "kriya" was used for meritorious and non-meritorious actions, virtue and vice, skillful and unskillful karma, and the word "kriyavadi" was used for those who performed actions. The word "kriya" has been used in many places in the meaning presented in the Agamas and Pali-Pitakas. This passage discusses action and karma. Karma means desire or impressions, which cause rebirth. When we imagine the birth and rebirth of the soul, then it becomes necessary to contemplate karma as its cause. In the time of Mahavira and Buddha, the word "kriyavaad" was prevalent for those who believed in karma. Therefore, the words "kriyavaad" and "karmavaad" became synonymous. Later, over time, the word "karmavaad" became prevalent in place of "kriyavaad". One reason for this is that as the subtlety of karma-thought increased, it also moved away from action-thought. This action-thought is present before us as the background of karma-thought. In "Prajnaapana", the word "kriya" is used, in "Sutrakritanga" the word "kriyasthan" is used, and in "Bhagavati" there is a discussion of action and "kriyavaad" on many occasions. This shows how important the discussion of action was at that time. This passage contemplates action from different perspectives. The general meaning of "kriya" is tendency, but here the word "kriya" is used in the sense of a specific tendency. Because there is no object in the world that does not have the capacity to act. An object is that which has the capacity to act, that which does not have the capacity to act is not an object. Therefore, every object has a tendency, but here the word "kriya" is used only for a specific tendency. Five types of "kriya" have been described: "kayiki", "praadhikaraniki", "praadveshiki", "paritaapaniki", and "praanaatipaatki". These five divisions of "kriya" have been made keeping in mind violence and non-violence. All eighteen "paapaasthanas" - "praanaatipaat", "mrishvaad", "adattadaan", etc. - are included in these five actions. In the third form, five types of "kriya" are described as follows: "praarambhiya", "pariggahiya", "mayaavattiya", "appachakkaanakriya", and "bhicchaadasanavattiya". These five actions are also included in the eighteen "paapaasthanas". Here, it is also explained who performs which action. For example, the action that occurs from "praanaatipaat" occurs in relation to the "shatjivanikaaya". The beings of the twenty-four "dandakas" like hell perform six types of "praanaatipaat". "Mrishvaad" is done in relation to all substances. "Adattadaan" occurs in relation to the substance that is taken. "Maithun" occurs in relation to form and those who have form. "Parigrah" occurs in relation to all substances. There is also a discussion about how many types of karma are bound by actions like "praanaatipaat", etc. "Sthaanaanga" 76 discusses the different types of actions in detail. There, "jivakriya", "ajivakriya", and then their divisions, sub-divisions - a total of seventy-two are mentioned. "Sutrakritanga" 60 mentions thirteen "kriyasthanas".

The Tattvartha Sutra instructs on twenty-five actions. In the Bhagavati, too, descriptions of actions are found in many places. All of them can be easily compared with the action-verb presented in the Prajnapanā, but due to the fear of expansion, we are not giving the comparison here. / Karma Siddhanta: From the twenty-third to the twenty-seventh verses, the nature of karma, karma-bandha, karma-bandha-veda, karma-veda-bandha, karma-veda-vedaka, these five verses discuss karma-related considerations. Karma Siddhanta is the essence of the thinking of Indian thinkers. In fact, the grand edifice of Astika Darshanas is based on Karma Siddhanta. Even though there may not be unanimity regarding the determination of the nature of karma, all thinkers have considered karma-mukti to be essential for spiritual progress. This is why all philosophers have thought about karma. But the karma-related thinking of Janadarshan is very subtle. In this vast universe, the disparities that are visible in various types of beings are rooted in karma. Jain Darshan did not consider karma to be merely a sanskar, but it is a substance-like entity that gets attached to the jiva due to the action of raga-dvesha. These substances are made up of infinite and infinite atoms, which are subtle and capable of being used for karma, located in the field of the jiva-pradesh. The atma attracts karma from all its pradeshas - sarvangas. These karma-skandhas transform into various natures or forms, such as jnana-avaraneya, darshan-avaraneya, etc. Infinite and infinite karma-pudgala-skandhas remain attached to each atma-pradesh. / Raga-dvesha-maya atma-parinat-bhavakarma is the karma that causes the transformation of the atma, and the pudgala that is attracted and attached to it is dravyakarma. / Karmanavargna, which is a type of pudgala-dravya, is prevalent throughout the universe. It is this karmanavargna that, upon receiving the cause of the jiva's emotions, transforms into karma. Here, the question may arise that if the atma is formless and karma-dravya is form, then how is the binding of the formless with the form possible? The solution is as follows: Jain Darshan considers the jiva and karma to be anadi from the perspective of flow. It is not its intention that the jiva was previously completely pure, and after that, it became bound by karma. The jiva that is situated in the world, caught in the cycle of birth and death, experiences raga-dvesha-rupa parinamas every moment. As a result of these parinamas, karma continuously binds. Due to the binding of these karmas, it has to take birth in various gatis. Upon taking birth, there is a body, there are senses in the body, and through the senses, the atma perceives objects. By perceiving objects, emotions of raga-dvesha arise. / In this way, emotions give rise to karma, and karma gives rise to emotions. This makes it clear that the jiva who is bound by material karma, i.e., even though it is formless in nature, it has become material due to being bound by karma, is the one who binds new karma. / In this way, the material comes into contact with the material, and the material also binds with the material. / Due to the old karma present in the atma, new karma binds. The process of karma-bandha with the atma is of four types: prakriti-bandha, sthiti-bandha, anubhaga-bandha, and pradesh-bandha. / When the atma receives karma-pudgalas, at that time, those pudgalas are uniform. But during the time of binding, they become of different natures - swabhava. This is called prakriti-bandha. In bound karma, the time limit is 181.

It is the state of being bound. The intensity or slowness of the karmic results due to the intensity or slowness of the self-results is called **anubhagabandh**, and the union of the karmic particles with the self-regions is called **pradeshabhandh**. Due to yoga, **prakriti** and **pradeshabhandh** occur, and due to **kṣaya**, **sthiti** and **anubhagabandh** occur. The present verses describe the different types of karmic roots based on different **prakritis**. The eight fundamental **prakritis** of karma, **nairāyika** etc., are present in all beings. The root cause of the bondage of **jñānāvaraṇa** etc. karmas is **rāga** and **dveṣa**. **Rāga** includes **māyā** and **lobha**, and **dveṣa** includes **krodha** and **māna**. Regarding the experience of the **vedana** of karmas, it is said that **vedaniya**, **prāyu**, **nāma** and **gotra** karmas are experienced by beings in all twenty-four **daṇḍakas**, but **jñānāvaraṇa**, **darśanāvaraṇa**, **mohaniya** and **antarāya**, these four karmas are experienced by some beings and not by others. Here, the word **anubhāva** is used for **vedanā**.

**Māhāra:** The name of the 100th **chintan** verse is **āhārapada**. In this, the consideration of food for beings is done through two objectives. In the first objective, food is considered through eleven doors, and in the second objective, it is considered through thirteen doors. In the twenty-four **daṇḍakas**, is the food of beings **saccitta**, **acitta**, or **miśra**? In response to this, it is said that the food of beings with **kriyaśarīra** is **acitta**, but beings with **audārikaśarīra** take all three types of food. In the twenty-four **daṇḍakas** of **nārka** etc., are beings **āhārarthī** or not through seven doors? After how much time do they become **māhārarthī**? What do they take in food? Do they convert all the food by taking it from all directions? Do they take the food particles with all their qualities or only a part of them? Do they eat all the particles they have taken? What happens to the food particles taken in food? These seven doors have been considered regarding food. The food that beings take as **māhārarthī** is of two types: **ābhōganirvatita** - taking food when there is a desire, and **anābhōganirvatita** - taking food without desire. There is a different time period for beings to take food when there is a desire, but food taken without desire is taken continuously.

The **skandha** with infinite **pradeśas** endowed with **varna**, **rasa**, etc., and the **pudgalas** that are clear from the **ātmapradeśas** and are deeply embedded in the **asankhyātapradeśa** region are useful for food. In the second objective of the present verse, the food, **bhavya**, **sanjī**, **leśyā**, **dṛṣṭi**, **sanyata**, **kṣaya**, **jñāna**, **yoga**, **upayoga**, **veda**, **śarīra**, and **paryāpti**, these thirteen doors have been discussed through the medium of the food and non-food options of beings. The discussion of the types of food in the first objective is not discussed here. Based on these two terms, **āhārak** and **anāhārak**, six **bhangas** have been created, and contemplation has been done regarding which beings have how many **bhangas** (options). **Ācārya Malayagiri** has raised this question in the third **sañjñī** door: the meaning of **sañjñī** is **samanaska**. When a being goes through **vigrahagati**, it is **anāhārak**. There is no mind in **vigrahagati**. Then how are they called **sañjñī**? The **Ācārya** has solved this question in this way: when a being goes through **vigrahagati**, it experiences the **vedanā** of the **āyukaryma** related to the **sañśī** being, therefore it is called **sañjñī**, even though it does not have a mind at that time.

Page #1175:
---------------------------
Mind is not there. The second question is why are Naraka, Bhavanapati and Vanavyantara called Asangya? The answer is that Asangya Jivas are born in these three, so they are called Asangya from this perspective. / Usage and Pasyatta are discussed in the twenty-ninth, thirtieth and thirty-third, these three terms respectively. In the Prajnapanasutra, these terms have been discussed in relation to the Bodha-Vyapar or Gyan-Vyapar of Jivas, therefore we have taken all three together here. From the Jain perspective, the soul is the knower, 183 it has no form, no taste, no smell. It is formless, Lokapraman Asankhya Pradeshi, eternal, usage is its special quality. 184 From the point of view of number, it is infinite. Usage is both the characteristic of the soul and the quality, 85 even though Aavdhi is included in usage, the reason for giving a separate term for it is that Aavdhi was specially considered in that time. In the present term, two types of usage and Pasyatta have been made - Sakaroupayog (knowledge) and Anakaroupayog (darshan), Sakarpasyatta and Anakarpasyatta. / Acharya Abhaydev has called Pasyatta as a special usage. While explaining further, it has also been told that the knowledge in which only Kalik Avabodh is there is Pasyatta, but the knowledge in which present-time knowledge is there is usage. This is the reason why Matijnana and Mati-Ajnana are not taken in the types of Sakarpasyatta. Because the subject of Matijnana and Mati-Ajnana is the substance that is formed in the present time. Why is Achakstudarshan not taken in Anakarpasyatta? Acharya has solved this question in this way that Pasyatta is Prakrut Ikshan and observation is possible only in Chakshudarshan, not in the darshan done by other senses. The use of Chakshu is short-lived compared to other senses and where there is short-lived use, there is extreme speed in the knowledge process. / This is the reason for this excellence. '86 Acharya Malayagiri has written that the word Pasyatta is like the word usage due to its meaning, and it is capable of presenting both Sakar and Anakar knowledge, however, it is necessary to understand that where there is usage for a long time, there is knowledge of all three times. Matijnana does not have long-term usage. Therefore, it does not have Kalik knowledge, due to which it has not been given a place in Pasyatta. 187 This is the difference between usage and Pasyatta. / Usage and Pasyatta, both of these are described in the twenty-four Dandakas of Jivas. / In fact, there is no special difference in them. In the term Pasyatta, the knowledge of the Kevalgyani and the use of darshan are simultaneous or in sequence, in this regard, it has also been discussed and argued that knowledge is Sakar and darshan is Anakar. / Therefore, how can both usages be at the same time? Sakar means Savikalp and Anakar means Nirvikalp. / Which 183. Acharang 5 / 5 Sutra 165 184. Acharang 516 Sutra 170-171 185.

"The use that takes in a particular aspect of an object is called *savikalpa* and the use that takes in the general aspect is called *nirvikalpa*. 88 Knowledge and philosophy are considered very ancient in folk literature. The karma that gives rise to knowledge is called *jnanabaran* and the karma that covers philosophy is called *darshanabaran*. The manifestation of the qualities of knowledge and philosophy occurs due to the destruction or cessation of these karmas. In the *pragam* literature, the words 'jaanai' and 'paasai' have been used for knowledge and philosophy respectively. The Digambara Acharyas have held that outward use is knowledge and inward use is philosophy. / Acharya Viresen writes in the *Dhavlaatika* of the *Shatkhandagam* that the perception of the external object, which is general and particular, is knowledge, and the perception of the self, which is identical, is philosophy. / The difference between philosophy and knowledge is that philosophy is the use of the self, which is general and particular - it is the vision of the self, while knowledge takes in the object other than the self. Those who hold the view that the perception of the general is philosophy and the perception of the particular is knowledge, are ignorant of the subject of philosophy and knowledge according to the present view. / General and particular are both qualities of matter. One cannot exist without the other. Knowledge that takes in only the general and only the particular is not valid. / Similarly, philosophy that takes in the general without the particular is false. 90 While expounding the present view, Brahmadeva wrote in the *Dravyasangrahavati* - Knowledge and philosophy should be considered from two perspectives - the perspective of logic and the perspective of principles. / To consider philosophy as general is appropriate from the perspective of logic, but from the perspective of principles, it is not the self, and the perception of the external object is knowledge. 16 From a practical perspective, there is a difference between knowledge and philosophy, but from a definitive perspective, there is no difference of any kind between knowledge and philosophy. 02 The distinction between knowledge and philosophy based on the general and the particular has also been refuted in other ways. This use of the general and the particular has been used to explain it to other philosophers, but for those who are knowledgeable in Jain philosophy, the *pragamic* explanation is acceptable. According to the scholastic tradition, the distinction between the self and the other is truly the essence. 03 The number of Acharyas who hold this view is not large, most philosophical Acharyas have accepted the distinction between the concrete and the abstract. To consider philosophy as general only means that the general quality is reflected in that use, and the particular quality is reflected in the use of knowledge. Both qualities are present in the object, but use is able to take in one quality primarily. There is a distinction between the general and the particular in use, but not in the object. 188. *Tattvarthasutra Bhashya* 119 189. *Shatkhandagam, Dhavla Teeka* 11114 190. *Shatkhandagam, Dhavla Vriti* 1:114 191. *Dravyasangrahavriti* verse 44 192. *Dravyasangrahavati* verse 44 193. *Dravyasangrahavriti* verse 44 [59]"

Page #1177:
---------------------------
What is the relationship between perception and knowledge from the perspective of time? This question also needs to be pondered. All the Acharyas agree that for the Chhadmastha, perception and knowledge occur sequentially, not simultaneously. There are three opinions among the Acharyas regarding how perception and knowledge are used in a Kevali. According to the first opinion, knowledge and perception occur sequentially. According to the second belief, perception and knowledge occur simultaneously. According to the third belief, there is no difference between knowledge and perception, meaning they are one. It is also stated in Aavashyakaniyukti, 64 Vishesh Aavashyak Bhashya, etc., that even a Kevali cannot have two uses simultaneously. The Agamas of the Shvetambar tradition are unanimous in this regard, they do not consider the perception and knowledge of a Kevali to be simultaneous. According to the Digambar tradition, Keval Darshan and Keval Gyan are simultaneous. Acharya Umaswati also held this view. The use of Mati, Shruta, etc. occurs sequentially, not simultaneously. In a Kevali, perception and cognitive use occur simultaneously in every moment. In the Niryamsar, Acharya Kundakunda has clearly written that just as light and heat are together in the sun, so too are perception and knowledge together in a Kevali. The third tradition is that of the great philosopher Acharya Siddhasen Divakar of the 4th century. He wrote in the Sanmatitark Prakaran Granth - "We can prove the difference between knowledge and perception up to Manah Paryaya, but it is not possible to prove the difference between Keval Gyan and Keval Darshan. The destruction of 100 Darshanavaran and Gyanavaran occurs simultaneously. How can a difference like 'this happens first, this happens later' be made in the use that arises from that destruction?" When liberation is attained, the first thing that is destroyed is Mohaniya Karma. After that, Gyanavaran, Darshanavaran, and Antaraya are destroyed simultaneously. When there is no difference in time in the destruction of both Darshanavaran and Gyanavaran, then on what basis can it be said that Keval Darshan happens first and Keval Gyan later? To solve this problem, if someone believes that both are simultaneously present, then that is also not appropriate, because two uses cannot happen simultaneously. The simplest and most logical solution to this problem is that there is no difference between perception and knowledge in the Kevali state. Assuming perception and knowledge to be separate creates another problem: if a Kevali knows everything in a single moment, then he should know everything forever. If his knowledge is not always complete, then how is he omniscient?

Page #1178:
---------------------------
If his knowledge is always complete, then the question of order and disorder does not arise. He is always uniform. There is no difference whatsoever between perception and knowledge. Knowledge is *savi-kalpa* and perception is *nirvi-kalpa*, this kind of distinction does not remain after the destruction of karma in the form of covering. / 203 Where there is incompleteness of use, there is a distinction between *savi-kalpa* and *nirvi-kalpa*. When there is complete use, there is no distinction of any kind. There is another problem, and that is that knowledge is always preceded by perception, but perception is not preceded by knowledge. 04 Once the *kevali* has attained complete knowledge, then perception cannot happen, because perception is not preceded by knowledge. Therefore, the order of knowledge and perception cannot occur. In the Digambara tradition, only the simultaneous side has been accepted. In the Svetambara tradition, three streams of order, simultaneity and non-duality were formed. These three streams have been harmonized from a new perspective by the great logician Yashovijayaji of the 17th century. 205 From the perspective of *Riju-sutra-naya*, the *Rimi* side is consistent. This perspective accepts the present time. The knowledge of the first time is the cause and the perception of the second time is its effect. There is an order of cause and effect in knowledge and perception. *Vyavahar-naya* is *bheda-sparshi*. From its perspective, the simultaneous side is also consistent. *Sangraha-naya* is *abheda-sparshi*, from its perspective, the non-dual side is also consistent. From the perspective of logic, the non-dual side seems more reasonable in these three streams. The second perspective is *pragamic*. Its exposition is *svabhava-sparshi*. It is natural to know the objective differences in the first time and to know the non-difference in the differences in the second time. The nature of knowledge is such that non-duality is contained in duality and duality is contained in non-duality, however, the time of knowledge-dominated knowledge and perception-dominated perception is not the same. / 20 There is no other discussion in *Prajnapana* regarding the relationship between use and *pasyatta*. In *Avadhi-pada*, there is a detailed discussion of seven topics related to *avadhi-jnana*: distinction, subject, institution, internal and external *avadhi*, *desha-avadhi*, decay-growth of *avadhi*, *pratipati* and *apratipati*. There are two types of *avadhi-jnana*: one is obtained from birth, the other from the destruction of karma. Devas and narakas have *avadhi-jnana* from birth, but humans and *tiryanch* have *avadhi-jnana* due to the destruction of karma. Although both types of knowledge are due to the destruction of karma, devas and narakas have it due to the cause of birth, and humans and *tiryanch* have it due to external causes like penance. There is also a detailed discussion of how much *avadhi-jnana* is present in whom. *Parama-avadhi-jnana* is only present in humans. In the original text of *Prajnapana*, there is a description of *pravadhi-jnana*, but no definition is given. The meaning of *avadhi-jnana* is that the limited knowledge of the material object that occurs from the soul without the help of the senses and mind is *avadhi-jnana*. 203. *Sanmati*. Chapter, 2/11 204. *Sanmati*. Chapter, 2/22 205. *Jnana-bindu*, page 154-164 206. (a) For specific details, see *Dharma-sangrahani* verses 1336-1359 (b) *Tattvartha-sutra*, Siddhasena Gani commentary, chapter 1, verse 31, page 77/1 (c) *Nandi-sutra*, Malayagiri commentary, page 134-138

Page #1179:
---------------------------
**Definition:** In the thirty-first chapter of the Sanjipa, all beings, including Siddhas, are considered in three categories: Sanji, Asanji, and Nosanji-Noasanji. Siddhas are neither Sanji nor Asanji, hence they are called Nosanji-Noasanji.  Among humans, Kevalis are also similar to Siddhas and belong to the same category. Although they have a mind, they do not acquire knowledge through its activities.

**Types of Beings:**  Beings are of two types: Sanji and Asanji. Beings from Ekendriya to Chaturindriya are only Asanji. Narakas, Bhavanpatis, Vanavyantara, and Panchendriya beings are both Sanji and Asanji. Jyotishka and Vaimanika are only Sanji.

**Meaning of Sanji:** The meaning of Sanji here is unclear because humans, Narakas, Bhavanpatis, and Vanavyantara Devas are also called Asanji. Therefore, the meaning that "one who has a mind is Sanji" does not apply here. Acharya Malayagiri has given two meanings of the word Sanji, but a complete solution is not found.

**Explanation:** Narakas, Bhavanpatis, Banavyantara, etc., are called Sanji and Asanji because they were Sanji and Asanji in their previous births.  Punnyavijaya Maharaj, in his commentary on the Agam Prabhavak, states that the meaning of the term Sanji-Prasanji is debatable.

**Usage of Sanji in Jain Literature:** The word Sanji is used in Jain literature with different meanings. In the Acharanga, it refers to the knowledge of remembering one's previous birth. In the Dasha Shruta Skandha, it refers to the state of Dattachitta Samadhi, where the term "Sanni Nanam" is used for remembering one's previous birth. In the Stananga, the first chapter mentions one Sanji, while the fourth chapter mentions four Sanjis: Aharasanji, Bhayasanji, Maithunasanji, and Parigrahasanji. The tenth chapter mentions ten Sanjis, including the four mentioned above, along with Krodha, Mana, Maya, Lobha, Loka, and Prodha.

**Two Meanings of Sanji:** Thus, Sanji has two meanings: Pratyabhijnana (recognition) and Anubhuti (experience).  Matigyan is also known as Sanji.  In the Tattvarth Sutra, Umaswati considers Mati, Smriti, Sanji, Chinta, and Abhinibodha as synonymous.  Malayagiri and Abhaydeva both define Sanji as a special type of Mati that arises after the understanding of the meaning (Vyanjanavagraha).

Page #1180:
---------------------------
The meaning of the term "sanjna" has been explained in various ways. Acharya Abhaydeva has also explained another meaning of "sanjna" as "anubhuti" (perception). The ten types of "sanjna" mentioned in the "Sthananga" are all related to perception. Acharya Umasvati, while explaining the difference between "sanjni" and "asanjni", has written that "sanjni" is that which has a mind. In the commentary, he further clarifies that the term "sanjni" refers to those beings who have "sampratharana sanjna" (conceptual perception). This is because only those who have "sampratharana sanjna" have a mind. The beings who are called "sanjni" due to "prahar" (food) and other types of "sanjna" are not meant here. The 32nd chapter is called "Samyat" (restrained). It discusses the four types of restraint: "samyat" (restrained), "asamyat" (unrestrained), "samyatasamyat" (partially restrained), and "nosamyat-noasamyat-nosamyatasamyat" (completely unrestrained). All beings are considered based on these four types of restraint. Narakas (hell beings), beings with one sense organ to beings with four sense organs, "vanavyantar" (intermediate beings), "jyotishka" (celestial beings), and "vaimanika" (aerial beings) are all "asamyat" (unrestrained). Five-sensed animals are both "asamyat" (unrestrained) and "samyatasamyat" (partially restrained). Humans have the first three types of restraint, and Siddhas (liberated beings) have the fourth type of restraint, "nosamyat-noasamyat-nosamyatasamyat" (completely unrestrained). The method of considering beings based on restraint is important. 

**Pravicharana:** The 34th chapter is called "Pravicharana" (reflection). The word "paviyarana" (reflection) used in this chapter is derived from the word "pravichar" (reflection). In the beginning of the chapter, where the doors are described, the text reads "pariyaranaya" and "pariyaranaya" in the original. The words "pravichar" or "pravicharana" in Sanskrit and "pariyarana" or "paviyarana" in Prakrit are used for play, love, enjoyment of senses, and sexual intercourse. The chapter discusses the possibility of "paricharana" (service), when, to whom, and how it is possible, based on 24 "dandakas" (sections). It is said that Narakas (hell beings) immediately start consuming food particles upon entering the "upapat" (birth) realm. This leads to the formation of their bodies, and after the particles transform into limbs, sense organs, etc., they begin "paricharana" (service), i.e., they start enjoying all objects, including sound, etc. After "paricharana" (service), they undergo "vikurvana" (transformation) into various forms. In the case of Devas (gods), "paricharana" (service) occurs after "vikurvana" (transformation). In beings with one sense organ, "paricharana" (service) is like that of Narakas (hell beings), but they do not undergo "vikurvana" (transformation), except for "vayukaya" (air body). In beings with two, three, and four sense organs, "paricharana" (service) is like that of beings with one sense organ, and in five-sensed animals and humans, it is like that of Narakas (hell beings). The chapter also discusses two types of food consumption by beings: "abhoganirvatit" (consumed for enjoyment) and "anabhoganirvatit" (consumed without enjoyment). All beings except those with one sense organ consume both "abhoganirvatit" (consumed for enjoyment) and "anabhoganirvatit" (consumed without enjoyment) food, but beings with one sense organ only consume "anabhoganirvatit" (consumed without enjoyment) food. Beings consume food purposefully according to their desire, which is "abhoganirvatit" (consumed for enjoyment), and the continuous consumption of food through "lomahar" (hair) and other means, even without desire, is "anabhoganirvatit" (consumed without enjoyment).

Acharya Malayagiri has written in the commentary of Prajnapan that even in Ekendriya, there is an Apat mind because Mano-labdhi is present in all beings. From Dwi-indriya to Chatur-indriya, there is an Apat mind, then why is Pra-nabhog-nirvartit Pahar only in Ekendriya and not in the rest? There is no proper solution to this question. The opinion of Pragam-Prabhakk Punyavijay Maharaj is that perhaps the creature with Ras-indriya has a mouth, therefore it has a desire to eat. Therefore, it is considered to have Pra-bhog-nirvartit Pahar, and in those who lack Ras-indriya, it is considered to be Ana-bhog-nirvartit. In this case, the person who consumes food knows the Pudgalas of food, sees them, and also does not know, does not see, and has contemplated on it with the alternative of Praadi. Regarding Adhyavasaya, relevant discussion has been done. Mainly, Adhyavasaya is of two types - one is Prashast and the other is Aprashast. From the perspective of Tartamta, there are countless differences in those Adhyavasayas. The Adhyavasayas of the beings of all twenty-four Dandakas have been discussed. Regarding the service of Devas, four alternatives have been given: 1. Dev Sadevi Saparichar 2. Dev Sadevi Aparichar 3. Dev Adevi Saparichar 4. Dev Adevi Aparichar. Bhavanpati, Banavyantar, Jyotishk, Soudharm and Ishana, these have Devis. Therefore, the first alternative is correct. Here, there is Kayik service in Devas and Devis. From Sanatkumar to Achyut Kalp, there are only Devas, no Devis. However, even in the absence of Devis, there is service. In Graveyak and Anuttar Vimanas, there are Devas, no Devis, and no service. The second alternative, Devas are there, Devis are there, and they are Aparichar, this alternative is not possible anywhere. Devis are not there, however, how is service possible, explaining this, it has been said (1) In Sanatkumar-Mahendrakalp, there is Sparsh-paricharana (2) In Brahmalok-Lantaka Kalp, there is Roop-paricharana (3) In Maha-shukra-Sahasrar, there is Shabd-paricharana (4) In Pranat-Pranat-Parana-Achyut Kalp, there is Manah-paricharana. In Kay-paricharana, Devas engage in sexual intercourse with Devis like humans. The Shukra Pudgalas in Devas have been mentioned here, and those Shukra Pudgalas go into Devis and transform into five Indriyas. There is no conception from that Shukra, because Devas have Vaikriya body. This Shukra is made from Vaikriya-varganas. Where Sparsh-praadi paricharana has been mentioned, there are no Devis in those Devalokas, but when those Devas desire, Devis come there by Vikurvana up to Sahasrar Devalok and Devas are satisfied by their Sparsh, Roop, Shabd in sequence. The commentator has explained here that even in those Devas, Shukra-visarjan happens, i.e., there is no contact between Devas and Devis, however, Shukra-sanraman happens and their Roop-lavannya increases due to its transformation.

In the Manat-Pranat-Parana-Achyut Kalpa, when the Devas desire mental service, the Devi, remaining in her own place, adorns herself with divine form and ornaments, and the Devas, remaining in their own place, are satisfied, and the Devi, remaining in her own place, becomes beautiful. Here it must be remembered that there is more pleasure in touch service than in body service, more pleasure in form service than in touch service, more pleasure in word service than in form service, more pleasure in mental service than in word service, and even more pleasure in the Devas who are not served. This makes it clear that there is an effect of pleasure in service, but due to the strength of the creature's attachment to character, it experiences pleasure in it. 25 Pain: A Contemplation The twenty-fifth verse is the verse of pain. In the twenty-four Dandakas, the experience of various kinds of pain by the living beings is discussed in this verse. Many types of pain have been described, such as (1) cold, hot, cold-hot (2) substance, field, time, emotion (3) physical, mental and both (4) present, absent, present-absent (5) painful, pleasant, not-painful-not-pleasant (6) self-accepted, induced (7) unconscious, conscious, etc. / The pain of the unconscious is unconscious, and the pain of the unconscious is called unconscious. _ Regarding the cold-hot pain, Acharya Malayagiri has raised the question that if the use is gradual, then how can the experience of both cold and hot be simultaneous? While solving the question, it has been written - The use is gradual, but due to rapid transmission, the order is not experienced at the time of experience, hence the Agam has said the simultaneous experience of cold-hot pain. The same is the case with physical-mental present-absent. 227 ... Acharya Malayagiri has defined the meaning of not-painful-not-pleasant pain as pleasant-painful, i.e. that which cannot be given the name of pleasure, because it also has the experience of pain. Pain cannot be given the name because it also has the experience of pleasure. What is the difference between present-absent and pleasure and pain? Acharya Malayagiri has also answered this question by saying that the pain that occurs due to the sequential emergence of the pudgalas of the pain-causing karma is present-absent, but when another person induces something, the experience of present-absent that occurs at that time is called pleasure-pain. There are two types of pain: self-accepted and induced / The meaning of acceptance is acceptance. We accept many things willingly / Austerity is not done due to the emergence of any karma, it is done due to acceptance / The pain that occurs in austerity is self-accepted pain. The meaning of induction is the induction of karma 225. Prajnapanatika, Letter 252 226. Prajnapanatika, Letter 555 227. Prajnapanatika, Letter 556 228. Prajnapanatika, Letter 556 229.

What is the cause? / When there is disease in the body, it stimulates karma, therefore it is the undertaking of the stimulation of karma / The pain that occurs due to the undertaking is called **pro-upkrama** pain / 230 **Samudghāt** : A contemplation, the name of the thirty-sixth verse is **Samudghālapad**. The projection of the **ātma-pradeśas** outside the body is called **samudghāt**. 23' In other words, it can also be said that the name of the **ātma-pradeśas** being born and going out of the body is **samudghāt** / 232 Seven types of **samudghāt** have been described, which are as follows - 9. **Vedanasamudghāt**, **samudghāt** that is dependent on the **asātavedaniya karma** / 2. **Kaṣāyasamudghāt**, **samudghāt** that is dependent on the **kaṣāyamohakarma** / 3. **Māraṇāntikasamudghāt**, **samudghāt** that is dependent on the remaining **antarmuhūrta** of lifespan / 4. **Vaikriyasamudghāt**, **samudghāt** that is dependent on the **kriyanāmakarma** / 5. **Tejasasamudghāt**, **samudghāt** that is dependent on the **taijasānāmakarma** / 6. **Māharakasamudghāt**, **samudghāt** that is dependent on the **āhārakanāmakarma** / 7. **Kevalasamudghāt**, **samudghāt** that is dependent on the **vedaniya**, **nāma-gotra** and **prāyuṣya karma** / In which of these **samudghāts** can how many **samudghāts** be found in which being, considering this, it is written - In hell, there are the first four **samudghāts**. In gods and **tiryañc** five-sensed beings, there are the first five **samudghāts**. Except for air, the remaining one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed beings have the first three **samudghāts**. In the air body, there are the first four **samudghāts**. In humans, all seven **samudghāts** can occur. From the perspective of beings, considering the **samudghāt** in terms of **alpabahutva**, it has been explained that the least number is of those who perform **pāharakasamudghāt** and the highest number is of those who perform **vedanasamudghāt**. There are more beings who do not perform **samudghāt** / In the same way, contemplation has been done from the perspective of **alpabahutva** in relation to **daṇḍakas**. Four types of **kaṣāyasamudghāt** have been made and considered based on the **daṇḍakas**. The previous six **samudghāts** are **chānasthika**. How many **pravagaha** and **sparśa** are there in these **samudghāts** and for how long do they remain? How many actions does the being perform at the time of **samudghāt**? All these questions have been considered. There is a detailed discussion regarding **kevalasamudghāt**. Before performing **kevalasamudghāt**, there is a special action which is in the form of **śubha yoga**. Its state is **mantmuhūrta** proof / Its function is to deposit the **karmadalikas** in the **udayāvalikā**. This action is called **prāvarjīkaraṇa**. Because the **ātma** is **prājita** or shaken towards liberation, it is also called **prāvajītakaraṇa**. Because it is definitely done by **kevalajñānīs**, it is also called **prāvaśyakakaraṇa**. These three names are found in **viśeṣāvaśyakabhāṣya**, **pañcasangraha** etc. / 23 In the literature of the **Digambara** tradition, only the name **pāvajītakaraṇa** is found / 234 230. **Abhyupgamen**  **aṅgīkāreṇ** **nirvṛttā** **tatra** **vā** **bhavā** **prābyupgamikī** **tayā**  **śirolochatapascaraṇādikayā** **vedanayā**-**pīḍayā** **upkramen**-**karmodyiraṇakāraṇena** **nivṛttā** **tatra** **vā** **bhavā** **prāupkramaikī** **tayā** **jvarātīsārādijanyayā**  /  -**sthānāṅga** **vatti** **patra** 84 231. **Samuddhananam** **samudghāt:** **śarīrād** **bahirjīvapradeśaprakṣepaḥ**. - **sthānāṅga** **abhaydeva** **vatti** 380 232. **Hantergamikriyātvat** **sambhūyātmāpradeśānām** **ca** **bahiruddhananam** **samudghāt:**  /  - **tattvārthavāttika** 1, 20, 12 233.

- When the state of Vedaniya, name and gotra karma and the state of Dalik Prayukarma and more than Dalik are present, then only for equalizing all of them, there is Kevalisamudghat / This Samudghat happens when the Antarmuhurt Praman Prayu remains. The time proof of Kevalisamudghat is the time of the text. In the first time, the Atma's regions are taken out of the body. At that time, their form is like a Danda. This Danda form of Atma regions is fourteen Rajjus long, from the top of the Lok to the bottom. Its thickness is equal to the body itself. In the second time, that Danda is expanded in the east, west, north, or south, and its form is made like a door. In the third time, the Atma regions of the door shape are made like a churn, that is, by spreading them in all four directions, east, west, north, and south, their shape becomes like a churn. In the fourth time, the empty parts of the Vidishas are filled with Atma regions, and they are spread throughout the Lok. In the fifth time, the Lok-wide Atma regions of the Atma are made churn-shaped again by Sanharan / In the sixth time, the churn-shaped is made into a door-shaped. In the seventh time, the Atma regions are again transformed into Danda form, and in the eighth time, they return to their original state. The Vedic tradition has contemplated the vastness of the Atma in the 235 texts. We can compare it to the fourth time of Kevalisamudghat, when the Atma becomes Lok-wide. The commentary literature is thus an unprecedented collection of material related to Vipul Dravyanuyog in the thirty-six verses of Prajnapan. Such a collection is rare elsewhere / The subject of Prajnapan is serious. The commentary literature was created by eminent thinkers to reveal the profound secrets of the Agamas. No Nirukti or Bhashya has been written on Prajnapan / Acharya Haribhadra has mentioned the Avni of Prajnapan in the Pradesh-Vyakhya of Prajnapan. 36 This makes it clear that there must have been some kind of Avchuni before Acharya Haribhadra, because the words 'Etaddukt Bhavat', 'Kimkt Bhavat', 'Ayamatra Bhavart', 'Idamatra Hridayam', 'Eteshi Bhavana' are used in the commentary / Acharya Malayagiri 3' has also mentioned Chuni in his Vritti. Here, it is natural to wonder who was the author of the Pravachuni or Chuni that was written on Prajnapan? Munishri Punyavijay Ji Maharaj believes that the author of Chani should be the Guru of Acharya Haribhadra, because these words are used in the commentary - 'Evam Tavat Pujyapada Pachkshate', 'Guravastu', 'Iha Tu Pujya:', 'Atra Guravo Vyachkshate' / Punyavijay Ji Maharaj also believes that there should be commentaries by other Acharyas on Prajnapan besides Acharya Haribhadra's Guru Jinabhatta. 35 But they are not available today, so what was their form? It cannot be said clearly / 235.

The commentaries available on Prajñapana at present, the first is the Pradeshvyākhyā by Ācārya Haribhadra. Haribhadra is an ancient commentator of Jain scriptures. He has written important commentaries on Prāvaśyaka, Daśavakālika, Jīvābhigma, Nandī, Anuyogadvāra, Piṇḍaniyukti prati. In the commentary on Prajñapana, the glory of Jain preaching has been sung first. After that, the auspiciousness has been analyzed and it has also been informed that the special explanation of auspiciousness has been done in the Prāvaśyaka commentary. While discussing the Bhavya-Prabhavya, the Ācārya has also quoted the verse indicating the nature of Abhavya by Vādimukhya. The second commentary on Prajñapana is by Ācārya Abhaydeva, the commentator of Navāngī. But this commentary is not on the entire Prajñapana, it is only on the third part of Prajñapana - the Alpabahutva of Jīvas. The Ācārya has shed light on this part through 133 gāthās. The Ācārya himself has given it the name 'Sangraha'. This explanation is also known as Dharmaratnasangrahaṇī and Prajñapanodvāra. On this Sangrahaṇī, Kulamaṇḍanagaṇī created an Avani in Samvat 1441. Avani on Prajñapana Tṛtīya Pada Sangrahaṇī has been published by Prānmānanda Jain Sabha Bhavnagar. But the name of the author of that Avani is not known. This Avani is somewhat more detailed than the Avani written by Kulamaṇḍanagaṇī. It is the opinion of Puṇyavijaya Jī Mahārāj that this Avani was created by some knowledgeable person to make the Avani written by Kulamaṇḍana more clear. The detailed commentary on Prajñapana is by Malayagiri. Ācārya Malayagiri was a well-known commentator. In his commentaries, the vastness of the subject, the simplicity of the language, and the maturity of the style are seen together. He has written commentaries on twenty-six texts, out of which twenty texts are available, six texts are unavailable. Malayagiri did not write independent texts, but only commentaries, but his commentaries are full of profound scholarship. He first explains the meaning of the words of the original sūtra, gives a clear indication of the meaning, and then discusses it in detail. He also touches upon relevant topics related to the subject. To make the subject authentic, he also quotes from ancient texts. Prajñapanāvṛtti is his important vṛtti. This vṛtti is four times more detailed than the Pradeshvyākhyā of Ācārya Haribhadra. This vṛtti is very useful for understanding the deep secrets of Prajñapana. At the beginning of the vṛtti, the Ācārya has given four auspicious verses. The first verse praises Bhagavān Mahāvīra. The second salutes the Jina preaching. The third verse salutes the Guru and the fourth verse promises to write a commentary on Prajñapana.

---------------------------
Acharya Malayagiri, while explaining the meaning of Prajnapana, has written that 'Prakarshen Jnapyante Anayeti Prajnapana', meaning that which makes known the objects like Jiva-Ajiva etc. is Prajnapana. Acharya Haribhadra in his Vritti has mentioned Prajnapana as an Upanga, but Acharya Malayagiri, going beyond him, has described Prajnapana as an Upanga of Samavayanga. His clear opinion is that the meaning described in Samavayanga is presented in Prajnapana. He has also written that it can be said that it is not appropriate to present the meaning described in Samavayanga in Prajnapana, but this statement is not appropriate, because Prajnapana is an expansion of the meaning presented in Samavayanga and this expansion has been done for the special benefit of the slow-witted disciple. Therefore, its composition is completely meaningful. / It is the belief of the knowledgeable that a particular limb is an Upanga of a particular limb, this kind of arrangement took place after Acharya Haribhadra and before Acharya Malayagiri. / We have already written that the foundation of Malayagiri's Vritti is the Pradesh-vyakhya of Acharya Haribhadra, however, Acharya Malayagiri has used many other texts. 242 For example, Acharya Haribhadra has indicated Siddhapraabhutta for whether a woman can become a Tirthankara or not? While Acharya Malayagiri has created the composition of Purva Yaks and Uttarapksha in relation to whether a woman is liberated or not? and has done a detailed analysis. 243 Similarly, regarding the nature of Siddha, he has discussed the views of various philosophers and finally established the nature of Siddha from the Jain perspective. / 144 Generally, Acharya Malayagiri has indicated the differences of opinion of various thinkers regarding the interpretation, but in some places he has also expressed his independent opinion and where he felt that it is confusing, he has not given his opinion and has simply said Kevaligamy. This statement is indicative of his fear of the world. Today, even in those subjects which we do not know anything about, those who give their opinion with authority, should take inspiration from that great Acharya. Acharya Malayagiri has discussed many subjects from both the perspective of logic and faith. For example, the composition of Prajnapana was done by Shyamacharya, but how is the dialogue between Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira and Ganadhar Gautam in it? How are there mentions of many differences of opinion even though there is a dialogue between Bhagwan Mahavira and Gautam? Along with the explanation of the fifteen types of Siddhas, their review has also been done. Women can attain liberation, they can study the Shadavashak, Kalik and Utkalik Sutras, discussion of Nigoda, explanation of Mlechchha, how is the inclusion of Ananta Pradeshi Skandha in countless Akash Pradeshas? Discussion of the reception and nature of the Pudgalas of language, how is the body countless even though there are infinite Jivas? etc. Acharya has given a brilliant introduction of his excellent talent by writing on various subjects. To bring together the harmony of many subjects, Acharya has explained using Nayashti and has mentioned the beliefs of previous Acharyas and previous sects in many places. The volume of the present Vritti is 16000 shlokas. / 242. (a) Panini: Swaprakrit Vyakaran - Patra 5, Patra 365 (b) Uttaradhyay. Niyukti Matha - Patra 12 / Jeeva Bhigamani p. 308 etc. 243.

After the explanation of the Praśam by Malayagiri, other six Ācāryas have also written explanations. But those explanations are not on me and are not so detailed. Muni Chandrasūri has written the Vanaśpatisaptatikā text on the subject of plants in the Prajñāpanā, which has 71 gāthās. There is also a pravarī on this by an unknown author. This is unpublished and its copy is in the Lalbhai Dalpatbhai Vidyamandhir Granthagar. Prajñāpanābījak is the work of Harṣakulagaṇī, according to the opinion of some scholars. Because there is no information anywhere at the beginning or end of the text. It contains a subject index of thirty-six verses of the Prajñāpanā in Sanskrit. This copy is also unpublished and is in the collection of the Lalbhai Dalpatbhai Vidyamandhir Granthagar. Padmasundar's Pravacūrī is also an unpublished work, which is mentioned by Ācārya Malayagiri in his commentary. Its copy is also available in the above-mentioned library. Dhanavimal's Bālāvabodha is also an unpublished work. The first translation in it is called Hanā, which is called Ṭavā. This Ṭavā was composed before Samvat 1767. The second Ṭavā or Bālāvabodha by Śrī Jīvavijaya is also available. This Ṭavā was composed in Samvat 1764. Paramanand's Stavak, i.e. Bālāvabodha, is available, which was composed in Samvat 1876. This Ṭavā is published in the Pravṛtti of Rāydhanpatsingh Bahadur's Prajñāpanā. Śrī Nānakchand's Sanskrit Chāyā is also available, which was published by Rāydhanpatsingh Bahadur (along with the Prajñāpanā). Pandit Bhagvandas Harakchand had also prepared a translation of the Prajñāpanāsūtra, which was published in Vikram Samvat 1991. Ācārya Amolkarṣi Ji Maharaj had also published an edition of the Prajñāpanā with a Hindi translation. Thus, various explanatory literature has been written on the Prajñāpanā from time to time. First in 1884, Dhanpatsingh published an edition of the Prajñāpanā from Banaras with the Malayagiri-written description, Rāmachandra's Sanskrit Chāyā and Paramanandarshi's Stavak. After that, in 1918-1919, the Prāgamoday Samiti Bombay published an edition of the Prajñāpanā with the Malayagiri Ṭokā. In Vikram Samvat 1991, an edition of the Prajñāpanā was published from the Bhagvandas Harṣachandra Jain Society Ahmedabad with the translation of the Malayagiri Ṭikā. In 1947-1949, an edition of the Prajñāpanā was published from the Ṛṣabhadevajī Kesarimala Jī Śvetambar Sansthā Ratlam, Jain Pustak Prachar Sansthā, Surat with the Pradeshvyākhyā written by Haribhadra. A magnificent publication has been published from the Mahāvīr Jain Vidyalaya, Bombay with the original text of the Paṇṇavaṇāsutta and a detailed introduction, edited by Puṇyavijaya Jī Maharaj. In Vikram Samvat 1975, a publication was published from Hyderabad with the Hindi translation by Śrī Amolkarṣi Jī Maharaj. In Vikram Samvat 2011, the original text of the Prajñāpanā edited by Śrī Pūphbhikkhu was published from the Sūtragamsamiti Gurgaon Cantonment. In this way, various editions of the Prajñāpanā have been published from time to time till today. Even though many editions of the Prajñāpanā have been published, this present edition was needed for an edition that has a pure original text, meaning and discussion at the main places, so that the subject can be easily understood. With this view, this Āgam is being published. The young Ācārya of the Śramaṇa Sangh, Mahāmahim Madhkar Muni Jī Maharaj, has planned to bring out new editions of the Āgams. This plan is a holy symbol of the foresight, firm determination, power and deep devotion of the young Ācārya towards the Āgam literature. It is only due to the strong efforts of the young Ācārya that many Āgams [70]

Many Praagams have already been published and many more are soon to be published. This arduous task has become easy and smooth due to the cooperation of many wise men. / The present edition of Prajnaapana has its own special feature. It contains the pure original text, meaning and commentary. The commentary is neither too long nor too short. / Ancient commentaries have also been used to clarify the subject. / Even though the subject is very serious, the commentator has made every effort to make it easy, simple and interesting. / It would not be an exaggeration to say that the commentary has filled the ocean in a pitcher. Prajnaapana is a vast treasury of Jain-Tattva-Gyan. It contains a collection of many important topics of Jain philosophy. It is the largest of the Upaangas. In the Angas, the place of Vyakhyaaprajnapti is the same as that of Prajnaapana in the Upaangas. Its editing work is not easy but difficult and more difficult, but it is a great joy that Shri Gyanamuni Ji, the son of the god of speech, has accomplished this great work. / Munishri's profound scholarship has been expressed everywhere. He has touched upon the profound, subtle and subtle subject with the subtlety and sharpness of his thinking. This has made the subject accessible not only to scholars but also to ordinary inquisitive people. He has edited and commented on Prajnaapana and presented a priceless gift to the treasury of Bharati. He deserves to be praised for this. Along with this, the labor of Pandit Shobhachandraji Bharill is also being expressed. / I wanted to write in great detail in the introduction of Prajnaapana, because there are many original topics in Prajnaapana on which it was necessary to think from a comparative perspective, but due to ill health, I could not write even though I wanted to. I started the introduction a long time ago and thought that it would be able to go into the first part, but due to not giving health, that thought was postponed. / The guidance of Sadguruvarya Upadhyay Shri Pushkaramuni Maharaj has also been very useful for me. I have not only hope but firm belief that this magnificent edition of Prajnaapana will prove to be very useful for enlightened readers. They will study it and increase their knowledge. / Like other Praagams, this Maagam will also captivate the minds of the people.  Veveendramuni Shastri Jain Sthanak Madan Ganj-Kishangarh Vijayadashami 16 October 1983 [ 71 ]

(23) Karmaprakritipada, (24) Karmabandhapad, (25) Karmabandha-vedapada, (26) Karmaveda-bandhapad, and (27) Karmaveda-vedakapada - These five padas are the exponents of the Karmasiddhanta and are mutually interconnected. Jain philosophy is based on a logical and scientific background. In Jain philosophy, every soul is considered equivalent to the Supreme Soul from the standpoint of certainty, whether the soul is in the form of earth, water, vegetation, insects, animals, birds, or humans. The Karmasiddhanta was born to answer the question of why there are disparities among the essentially similar souls. It is due to the influence of karma that the jivas have varying degrees of physical bodies, senses, movements, species, limbs, etc. The cause of the varying degrees of development of the soul's qualities is also karma. The Karmasiddhanta primarily serves three purposes: (1) to eliminate the erroneous aspects of the theistic beliefs of the Vedic religion, (2) to refute the absolute momentariness of the Buddhist doctrine, and (3) to establish the soul as a distinct conscious entity separate from the inert substance.

## The Futility of Practices like Vrata in the Prajñapana Sutra

The Prajñapana Sutra highlights the futility of practices like Vrata and other such practices in achieving liberation. To rectify these misconceptions and enlighten the world with the truth, Bhagwan Mahavir not only preached through his words but also demonstrated the reality of the Karma theory through his own actions of Karma-Kshaya (destruction of Karma). While the Tathagata Buddha acknowledged Karma and its consequences, his theory of momentariness (Kshanikavada) makes the origin of Karma and its consequences impossible. The experience of the fruits of one's own Karma and the influence of others' Karma can only occur if the soul is neither eternally permanent nor eternally momentary. Some non-believers completely reject the concepts of rebirth and the afterlife. According to them, the fruits of good and bad Karma, auspicious and inauspicious Karma, do not occur. Then what is the meaning of spiritual practices? To answer this question realistically, Bhagwan Mahavir established the Karma theory. Without Karma, the connection between birth and rebirth, this world and the afterlife, cannot exist. Those who say that the soul is ignorant and incapable of experiencing the painful consequences of its own Karma are like helpless children. They are unaware of the unique power of Karma. If others are considered to be instrumental in experiencing the fruits of Karma, then one's own Karma becomes meaningless. This would also negate the efforts of the soul and discourage the motivation to engage in virtuous actions and abstain from non-virtuous ones. This is why Bhagwan Mahavir, in the 23rd Karma-Prakriti-Pada, does not attribute the creation, sustenance, or destruction of the universe, or the distribution of the fruits of Karma, to any deity or power. Instead, he states that the soul itself is responsible for binding Karma, experiencing its consequences, and reaping the fruits of its own actions and Karma-Kshaya. The soul has been wandering through various states of existence and births for an infinite period, bound by its own Karma. The soul carries its own good and bad Karma into the next life and experiences happiness, sorrow, and other consequences accordingly.

Some philosophers raise an objection to the Karma theory, arguing that according to the 23rd Pada, Karma is eternally attached to all beings, and there is an eternal connection between Karma and the soul. If this is true, then Karma can never be completely destroyed. However, there is no such absolute, universal rule regarding the Karma theory. This is why the second Uddeshaka of the 23rd Pada clarifies that all Karma has a specific time limit. When that time is fulfilled, the Karma is destroyed. Just as gold and clay, milk and ghee, though eternally connected in a flowing stream, can be separated through specific efforts, similarly, although the soul and Karma are eternally connected in a flowing stream, they are not eternally connected individually. The eternal connection between the soul and Karma also has an end. When the state of pre-bound Karma is fulfilled, it separates from the soul. New Karma continues to be bound. Thus, even though Karma is eternally present in a flowing stream, through practices like penance, restraint, and Vrata, the flow of Karma is eventually destroyed, and the soul becomes Siddha, Buddha, and liberated.

---------------------------
The Yamik [Yamik] preface makes it clear that the soul's existence is eternal and bound by karma. In this situation, a question naturally arises: which comes first, the soul or karma? If the soul comes first, then the binding of karma with it must be considered "saadi" [saadi] from the time it occurred. The Jain perspective's solution is that karma is "saadi" [saadi] in relation to the individual and "anaadi" [anaadi] in relation to the flow. But how long will the flow of karma continue? No one except the omniscient knows or can tell, because the future, like the past, is infinite. Some individuals may doubt that all beings are soul-filled and that the characteristic of the soul is knowledge, then why don't all beings have equal knowledge? The answer is that the soul is indeed full of knowledge, but it is covered by the veil of karma, and due to that veil, the light of the soul's knowledge-quality is obscured by the clouds of karma. Just as the sun's light appears when the clouds clear, so too, as the veil of karma is removed, the soul's qualities of knowledge, etc., become increasingly apparent. From this, another question arises: is karma stronger or the soul? From an external perspective, karma appears powerful, because the soul, under the sway of karma, keeps cycling through birth and death in various forms. But from an internal perspective, the soul's power is infinite. Just as it binds karma through its own culmination, it also has the capacity to destroy karma. No matter how powerful karma may seem, the soul is even more powerful. Soft water breaks hard stones into pieces. Similarly, the soul's infinite power shatters karma. To understand this, it is necessary to know the characteristics of both karma and the soul to recognize their separate powers. The soul, in its pure (certain) form, is full of knowledge, perception, bliss, and power (vigor). These qualities are suppressed due to the veil of karma. When the veil of karma is completely removed, consciousness manifests fully, and the soul becomes the Supreme Soul. The characteristic of karma is that which is done by the being due to the five causes of falsehood, etc. Falsehood, non-restraint, carelessness, passions, and attachment, any of these five causes brings a kind of unconscious substance into the soul, which is called by various names in other philosophies, such as invisible, ignorance, illusion, nature, impressions, etc. Therefore, it is karma that binds with the soul, having the passions of attachment and aversion as its cause, and in due time, it (karma) begins to bear fruit in the form of happiness and suffering. There are mainly two types of karma: भावकर्म [bhaavakarma] and द्रव्यकर्म [dravya karma]. Unconscious karmic substance is attracted towards the soul, having the passions of attachment and aversion as its cause, and those passions are called भावकर्म [bhaavakarma]. When that unconscious karmic substance becomes united with the soul like milk and water, it is called द्रव्यकर्म [dravya karma]. Although in Jain philosophy, the main causes of भावकर्मबन्ध [bhaavakarmabandh] are the five causes of falsehood, etc., and in brief, passions, and...

---------------------------
The **Prajñāpanā Sūtra** has stated two causes of yoga, however, in the first Uddesaka of the twenty-third chapter, **rāga** and **dveṣa** are stated as the cause of **bhāvakarma-bandha**. The four **kṣayās** are included within these two. Any mental or intellectual tendency is either in the form of **rāga** (attachment) or **dveṣa** (hatred or anger etc.). Therefore, **rāga**-based or **dveṣa**-based tendencies are considered the cause of **bhāvakarma-bandha**. Whether a being is aware or not, due to its **rāga**-**dveṣa**-based desires, **bhāvakarma** remains attached to **dravya-karma** in an unmanifest form. The binding nature of karma (the power to create karma-lepa) is also related to **rāga** and **dveṣa**. According to the **rāga**-**dveṣa**-generated mental tendencies, due to the **kṣayās** like anger, there are physical and verbal actions, which become the cause of acquiring **dravya-karma**. Karma-bandha resulting from actions generated by **kṣayās** is particularly strong, but karma-bandha resulting from actions without **kṣayās** is weak and short-lived. It can be destroyed with a little effort and time. In fact, when a being acts with its mind, speech, and body, it attracts **karma-pudgala** atoms from all sides. The binding of these acquired **pudgala** atoms with the soul in the form of karma is called **dravya-karma**. In fact, the mind and destiny of a being remain in accordance with the karma it has performed. When **pūrvabaddha-karma** arises, it affects the destiny of the soul and according to that, new **karma-bandha** continues to occur. This cycle has been running continuously since time immemorial (like a stream). Even though the soul is pure in terms of knowledge and vision, due to its **kṣayā**-based, modified tendencies or actions, it continues to attract such impressions (**bhāvakarma**) and accordingly, it continues to acquire **karma-pudgala**. In this process of acquisition, the pulsation of mind, speech, and body becomes supportive. According to the intensity and weakness of **kṣayās** or **rāga**-**dveṣa**, a being is bound by those karmas and according to the bound karmas, it continues to receive auspicious and inauspicious fruits in the form of happiness and sorrow, either immediately or later. But when this soul, with its unique power of knowledge etc., becomes completely free from all karmas, then karma does not bind with the soul again and does not give its fruits. According to the theory of karma, it is clear that the soul itself creates such nature and circumstances according to its past karmas, which affects the external material and accordingly, there is transformation, and accordingly, the fruits of karma are automatically obtained. When the time for the ripening of karma arrives, the intensity, weakness, and medium of its fruit is obtained according to the material, field, time, and emotion that are present during its period of arising. There is no other giver of this fruit. If someone else is considered to be the giver of the fruit of karma, then self-created karmas will become meaningless, and the self-effort of the being will also be lost. Then, there will be no enthusiasm for engaging in virtuous actions and abstaining from non-virtuous actions, nor will there be any effort.

---------------------------
[Primary] This section addresses various questions that arise regarding the theory of karma from the 23rd to the 27th chapter. A clear and concise solution is provided here from the perspective of the four types of karma-bandha. The binding of dravya-karmas is categorized into four types: prakriti-bandha, sthiti-bandha, pradesha-bandha, and anubhava-bandha. The transformation of bound karma-paramanu into a covering for the soul's qualities like knowledge, etc., and the generation of different types of nature in those karma-pudgalas is prakriti-bandha. The duration of the time of karma-vipak (karma-phala) (the time limit of jadhanya-utkrista) is sthiti-bandha. The binding of the group of acquired pudgala-paramanu with the soul's pradeshas in a lesser or greater degree in the form of karma is pradesha-bandha. This determines the number of karma-paramanu (karma-pradeshas) with different natures, and the intensity-mildness, etc., of the power of the acquired pudgala-paramanu to bear fruit in the form of karma is anubhava-bandha. It is natural for some questions to arise regarding karma, and these chapters provide solutions to them. How many are the mool-karmas? How many are their uttarabhedas? How and for what reasons does the soul bind with karmas? How does the power to bear fruit arise in karmas? Which karma remains attached to the soul for the least and the most amount of time? For how long does the karma attached to the soul remain incapable of bearing fruit? Can the fixed time of vipak be changed? If so, how, and by what soul-transformations? At the time of the binding of one karma, what other karmas can be bound or experienced? At the time of the experience of one karma, what other karmas are experienced? In this way, a detailed and logical description is given of the various questions that arise in relation to the states of bandha, udaya, udirana, and satta, etc. * Firstly, in the first uddeśaka of the twenty-third chapter, 'karma-prakriti-pada', the theory of karma is discussed through five doors. The first door deals with the number of mool karma-prakritis and their arrangement in the twenty-four dandakavarti jivas. The second door explains how samuccaya jivas and dandakavarti jivas bind eight karmas. The third door explains how one or many samuccaya jivas and twenty-four dandakavarti jivas bind the eight karmas of jnana-avaranīya, etc., due to two reasons: raga and dvesha (which include the four kṣayās of krodha, etc.). The fourth door explains how samuccaya jivas or twenty-four dandakavarti jivas experience which karmas in the eight karmas of jnana-avaranīya, etc., in relation to unity and multiplicity. After this, the fifth door, katividha-anubhava, explains in detail how the jiva's bound, sprusht, bound-sprusht, sanchit, chit, upacit, apaka-prapta, vipak-prapta, phala-prapta, udaya-prapta, krit, nishpadit, parinamit, svat: or paratah udirit, ubhwayat: udirana are the vipak or phala of which karmas in relation to motion, position, and bhava. In the second uddeśaka of the twenty-third chapter, the mool and uttar-prakritis of the prushta karmas are first described. Then, the eight karmas of jnana-avaranīya, etc., are described (including their bhed-bhedas).

Page #1203:
---------------------------
The **Prajnapana Sutra** has been explained. Following this, it has been explained which karma, from the **Jnanavaraniya** to the **Sanjnee-Asanjnee Panchaindriya**, binds a being from **Ekendriya** to **Sanjnee-Asanjnee Panchaindriya** for how long? And which beings bind the **Jnanavaraniya** etc. karmas in their lowest and highest states? * In the 24th **Karmabandha-pada**, it is explained that a being in the 24th **Dandakavarti** state, while binding one karma, binds how many other karmas, i.e., how many other karmas does it bind? * In the 25th **Karmabandha-Vedapada**, it is explained that a being, while binding one karma out of the eight karmas, experiences the **vedana** of which other karma-types? In the 26th **Karmaveda-Bandhapada**, it is said that a being, while experiencing one karma from the **Path** karmas, binds how many other karmas? * In the 27th **Karmaveda-Vedakapada**, it is said that a being, along with the experience of one karma, experiences the **vedana** of which other karma-types? * Through the explanation of these five **padas**, the author has clearly indicated that a being is free in performing actions and experiencing their fruits, in binding new karmas and in experiencing the fruits of karma with equanimity, and that the purpose of the **Karma Siddhanta** is not to achieve **Devagati** or a particular type of body etc., but to attain liberation from karmas forever, to be free from birth and death. This is the fulfillment of the soul's **purushartha**, and this is the attainment of the pure, **siddh-buddh-mukta** form of the soul. For this fourth **purushartha** - **moksha**, both **punya** and **papa** karmas are to be abandoned. **Samyagdarshan**, **Samyaggnan**, **Samyakcharitra**, and **Samyaktap** are the ultimate means of **moksha-purushartha**, which are absolutely necessary for the destruction of karma. The soul, through its **purushartha**, can gradually destroy karma and completely destroy karma with purity. This is the fact that the author has indicated. 00

The Twenty-third Karma-Prakriti-Pada, the First Uddesaka:

**First Uddesaka**

This first Uddesaka deals with the collection of topics in the Sangrahani-Gatha 1664.

**Questions:**

1. How many Karma-Prakritis are there?
2. How do they bind?
3. From how many places does the Jiva bind Karma?
4. How many Karma-Prakritis does the Jiva experience?
5. What are the different types of Anubhava (experience) of Karma?

**Explanation:**

This Uddesaka explores the consequences of Karma-bandha (binding of Karma) from various perspectives through five "doors":

1. **First Door:** The number of Karma-Prakritis.
2. **Second Door:** The types of Karma-bandha.
3. **Third Door:** The places from which Karma is bound.
4. **Fourth Door:** The number of Karma-Prakritis experienced.
5. **Fifth Door:** The different types of Anubhava (experience) of various Karmas.

**First Door: The Number of Karma-Prakritis**

**Gatha 1665:**

**Question:** "How many Karma-Prakritis are there, Bhagavan?"
**Answer:** "There are eight Karma-Prakritis, Gautama. They are:

1. **Jnana-Avaraniya:** (Knowledge-obscuring)
2. **Darsana-Avaraniya:** (Perception-obscuring)
3. **Vedaniya:** (Experiential)
4. **Mohaniya:** (Deluding)
5. **Ayus:** (Lifespan)
6. **Nama:** (Name)
7. **Gotra:** (Lineage)
8. **Antaraya:** (Obstruction)

**Gatha 1666:**

**Question:** "How many Karma-Prakritis are there for the Narayikas (hell beings), Bhagavan?"
**Answer:** "The same eight Karma-Prakritis apply to Narayikas, Gautama, and all the way up to the Vaimanikas (heavenly beings)."

##  [10] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra Vivēcana (1)  

**Eight Karma-Prakṛtis and their Harmony in Twenty-Four Daṇḍakas**

It is well-known that there are eight Karma-Prakṛtis and their harmonious relationship in twenty-four Daṇḍakas. All sentient beings, from Naraka to Vaimānika, are bound by these eight Karma-Prakṛtis.

**The Nature of the Eight Karma-Prakṛtis:**

1. **Jñānāvaraṇīya:** This Karma obscures the knowledge faculty of the soul. Knowledge is the perception of the specific aspect of a general-specific object. That which covers it is Jñānāvaraṇīya.

2. **Darśanāvaraṇīya:**  'Darśana' is the perception of the general nature of an object without perceiving its specific characteristics. That which obscures the perception faculty of the soul is Darśanāvaraṇīya.

3. **Vedaniya:** This Karma causes the soul to experience pleasure and pain.

4. **Mohaṇīya:** This Karma makes the soul dull and devoid of the ability to discern between the real and the unreal.

5. **Prāyuka:** This Karma keeps the being in a particular existence.

6. **Nāmaka:** This Karma produces the results of the being's actions, such as its movement and transformation.

7. **Gotra:** This Karma determines whether the being is considered high or low, or, in other words, the being is born into a noble or ignoble family due to the manifestation of this Karma.

8. **Antarāya:** This Karma creates obstacles or hindrances between the being and its actions, such as giving charity, or it creates obstacles for the being who is eager to perform such actions.

**Second: How does it bind?**

**Dvāra 1667:**

**Question:**  Bhagavan! How does a being bind the eight Karma-Prakṛtis?

**Answer:** Gautama! With the arising of Jñānāvaraṇīya Karma, the being certainly acquires Darśanāvaraṇīya Karma. With the arising of Darśanāvaraṇīya Karma, the being certainly acquires Darśanamohaṇīya Karma. With the arising of Darśanamohaṇīya Karma, the being certainly acquires Mithyātva. And, Gautama, with the arising of Mithyātva, the being certainly binds the eight Karma-Prakṛtis.

**Dvāra 1668:**

**Question:** Bhagavan! How does a Naraka being bind the eight Karma-Prakṛtis?

**Answer:** Gautama! It should be understood in the same way (as explained before). Similarly, it should be understood from Asura-Kumāra up to Vaimānika.

**Dvāra 1666:**

**Question:** Bhagavan! How do beings bind the eight Karma-Prakṛtis?

Twenty-third Karma-Prakriti-Pad [11 [1666 Pr.] Bhagavan! How do many beings bind the Path Karma-Prakritis? [1666 U. Gautam! To know as before / In the same way, up to many Vaimanikas (it should be understood). In the Vivichana-Samuccaya, the oneness-plurality of the being and the twenty-four Dandakas is explained due to the Ashtakarma-bandha - in the present second door, how does the being bind the Ashtakarma-bandha? It has been explained by clarifying that when the excellent rise of Jnana-Avarana occurs, the Darshan-Avaraniya Karma arrives, i.e., the being knows the Darshan-Avaraniya Karma from its rise / From the rise of Darshan-Avaraniya, Darshan-Moha arises, and from the rise of Darshan-Moha, Mithyatva arises, and when Mithyatva arises, all eight Karmas arrive, i.e., the being binds the Path Karma-Prakritis from the rise of Mithyatva / This is the order of binding (or arrival) of the Path Karmas in all beings. The meaning of these four sutras is that there is a mutual binding of Karma from Karma / Explanation - Acharya Malayagiri has considered this sutra-chatushtaya as 'Prayik' by interpreting the word 'Khalu' used in this sutra as 'Prayah' / Its meaning is that some Samyagdrsti also bind the eight Karma-Prakritis / Only the subtle-Samparaya-Gunasthan-varti-Samyata, etc., do not bind the Path Karmas. It should be known - here, only Mithyatva has been told as the main reason for the binding of Jnana-Avaraniya, etc., Karmas, not Aviriti, Pramada, Kashaya and Yoga, but Aviriti, Pramada and Kashaya are also included in the traditional reasons. Because the being binds Jnana-Avarana, etc., Karmas, its (in Sutra 1670) main reasons are given as - Raga and Dvesha / Maya and Lobha are included in Raga, and Krodha and Mana are included in Dvesha. Third Door: Kati-Sthan-Bandha-Dwar 1670. Jove Nam Bante! Ganavaranijja Karma Katihi Thanehi Bandhati? Goyama!

[12] [Prajñāpanasūtra [1670 u.] Gautama! It binds (the knowledge-obscuring karma) from two causes (places), namely, from attachment and aversion / Attachment is said to be of two types, namely, delusion and greed / Aversion is also said to be of two types, namely, anger and pride / Thus, the living being binds the knowledge-obscuring karma from four places (causes) generated from semen. 1671. And so it should be said from the hellish beings / [1671] From the hellish beings up to the celestial beings, in the same way (it should be said) / 1672. O Lord! How many causes do living beings bind the knowledge-obscuring karma? Gautama! From the aforementioned two causes (they bind) / And those two should be understood as having four types as before. 1673. And so it should be understood from the hellish beings / [1673] In the same way, it should be understood from many hellish beings up to the celestial beings / 1674. [1] And from the sight-obscuring karma up to the hindering karma / [1674-1] These same causes of karma-binding should be understood from the sight-obscuring karma up to the hindering karma. [2] And these are sixteen dandakas with the intention of oneness (singular) and multiplicity (plural). Discussion - How many causes are there for karma-binding? In the second gate, the order of binding of karma-natures and their external causes are explained, while in this third gate, the internal causes of karma-binding are considered. 'The nature of attachment-aversion and passions - That which is in the form of pleasure is called attachment and that which is in the form of displeasure is called aversion / Attachment is of two types - delusion and greed / Since both of these are in the form of pleasure, they are included in attachment, while anger and pride, both of these are in the form of displeasure, therefore they are included in aversion. Anger is in the form of displeasure, and pride is also in the form of displeasure because it is intolerant of the qualities of others.' Conclusion (according to the original text) The living being binds the knowledge-obscuring karma and the remaining seven karmas from the aforementioned (two and) four causes generated from its semen / 1.

Jain Terms Preserved:

The Nineteenth Karmapad [19] - Gautama! The five-fold anubhava (experience) of the antarāya karma (obstructive karma) bound to the jīva (soul) is expounded. That is, (1) dānāntarāya (obstruction to charity), (2) lābhāntarāya (obstruction to acquisition of wealth), (3) bhogāntarāya (obstruction to enjoyment), (4) upabhogāntarāya (obstruction to consumption), and (5) vīryāntarāya (obstruction to energy).

Whatever is experienced by the pudgala (matter) or the pudgalas or the transformation of the pudgalas or the transformation of the pudgalas by nature, or whatever antarāya karma is experienced by their udaya (rise), that, O Gautama! is the antarāya karma, of which the five-fold anubhava (experience) is expounded.

Page #1215:
---------------------------
[20] It is established by the Prajnapana that the Jiva, at the time of karma-bandha, first receives the ordinary (non-specific) pudgalas of the karma-vargana, i.e., at that time there is no distinction of jnana-avaraneya, etc. Subsequently, by the anabhogika virya, at the same time of karma-bandha, it transforms and arranges the jnana-avaraneya, etc. in a specific form, just as a pahara is transformed into rasādi-rupa dhatus, in the same way, receiving the ordinary pudgalas of the karma-vargana, transforming them into specific forms of jnana-avaraneya, etc. is called 'nivartana'.  

Jīveṇaṁ parināmiyasssa -  It is transformed by the Jiva, i.e., it has been progressively transformed due to specific causes like jnana-pradosha, jnana-nihnava, etc.  

Sāyaṁ vā udīṇṇassa - The karma itself has attained udaya, i.e., it has attained vipaka independently.  

Pareṇa vā udoriyassa - Or it has been stimulated by another, i.e., it has been made to attain udaya.  

Taduabhayeṇa vā udīrijjaṁāṇassa - Or the karma (jnana-avaraneya, etc.) is attaining udaya by itself and by others.  

Svanimitta se udaya ko prapt - It attains udaya by its own cause -  Gati pappa - It attains a particular gati, i.e., a karma attains a particular gati and becomes intense in its experience, for example, the asata-vedaniya karma becomes intense in its experience by attaining the naraka-gati.  

The asata-vedaniya karma is more intense for the narayikas than for the tiryanchas, etc.  

Thitī pappa - It attains a particular sthiti, i.e., it attains the most excellent sthiti, the ashubha karma becomes intense in its experience like mithyatva.  

Bhavam pappa - It attains a particular bhava, i.e., some karmas attain a particular bhava and manifest their vipaka in a specific form, for example, the nidra-rupa darshanavaraneya karma manifests its specific experience by attaining the manushya-bhava or the tiryancha-bhava.  

The implication is that the jnana-avaraneya, etc. karmas attain udaya (become fruit-oriented) by attaining that particular gati, sthiti, or bhava.  

Paranimit se udaya ko prapt - It attains udaya by another cause -  Poggalam pappa - It attains a particular pudgala, i.e., it attains udaya by the contact of a particular pudgala like wood, a clod, or a sword, or by the contact of wood, a clod, a stone, or a sword thrown by someone.  

Poggalaparinamam pappa - It attains udaya by the transformation of a pudgala, i.e., it attains udaya by the contact of the transformation of a pudgala, for example, the jnana-avaraneya karma attains udaya due to the consumption of alcohol, or the asata-vedaniya karma attains udaya due to the indigestion of food.  

The conclusion of the question - The conclusion of the question in Sutra 1676 is that the jnana-avaraneya karma, which has attained udaya by the contact of various causes like bandha, spashta, etc., how many types of experiences (vipaka-phala) does it have?

## Twenty-Third Karma-Pad: 

**Ten Types of Experiences of the Jnanavaran Karma: What, Why, and How?**

The original text describes ten types of experiences of the Jnanavaran Karma, starting with Shrotravaran. Shrotravaran means the covering of the Shrotrendriya (sense organ of hearing) related to Kshayopa-sham (attainment). Shrotravijnana-avaran means the covering of the use of the Shrotrendriya. Similarly, one should understand the covering of attainment (Kshayopa-sham) and use of each sense organ. 

Among these, one-sense beings (Ekendriya) usually have a covering of attainment and use related to the sense organs of hearing, sight, smell, and taste. Two-sense beings (Dwiendriya) have a covering of attainment and use related to the sense organs of hearing, sight, and smell. Three-sense beings (Triendriya) have a covering of attainment and use related to the sense organs of hearing and sight. Four-sense beings (Chaturindriya) have a covering of attainment and use related to the sense organ of hearing. Those whose bodies are afflicted with leprosy or other diseases have a covering of attainment and use related to the sense organ of touch. Those who are blind, deaf, mute, etc., from birth or later, should be understood to have a covering of attainment and use related to the sense organs of sight, hearing, etc. 

The covering of attainment and use of the sense organs arises either by itself or due to the arising of the Jnanavaran Karma, which is stimulated by others. Explaining this fact, the scriptures say: "Jan vevei poggalan va itiyadi," meaning: "The knowledge or the culmination of knowledge is obstructed by the impact of a piece of wood, a sword, or other such Pudgalas thrown by others or capable of striking, or by many Pudgalas capable of obstructing knowledge, or by the consumption of food or drink that has a counterproductive effect, or by the experience of the natural effects of cold, heat, sunlight, etc., which cause damage to the sense organs, leading to the obstruction of the culmination of knowledge, due to which the being is unable to know the knowable objects within the range of the sense organs."

This explains the relative arising of the Jnanavaran Karma. After this, the scriptures also explain the absolute arising: "Due to the arising of the Jnanavaran Karma Pudgalas, the being is unable to know what is knowable, even though there is a desire to know, or even though they were able to know before, they are unable to know after the arising of the Jnanavaran Karma, or the knowledge of the being is obliterated (lost) due to the arising of the Jnanavaran Karma. This is the nature of the Jnanavaran Karma."

**Nine Types of Experiences of the Darshanavaran Karma: Cause, Type, and Arising**

The causes of the experiences of the Darshanavaran Karma are the same as those mentioned for the experiences of the Jnanavaran Karma, namely, bound, touched, etc. These experiences are of nine types, whose nature is described in two verses as follows:

"Suh-padiboha niha, niha-nidda ya dukkha-padiboha. Payala hoi thiyassa u, payala-payala ya chakamato ||1|| Thi-na-giddi pun aisankili-ttha-kammanaveyane hoi. Mahani-dda din-chintiya-vaavara-pasahani payam //2//"

**Note:** The above translation preserves the Jain terms and provides a brief explanation of their meaning. For a deeper understanding, it is recommended to consult original Jain scriptures and commentaries.

## 22] [Prajñāpanasūtra]  

**Sleep** is that which can be easily awakened from. **Nidrānidrā** is that deep sleep which is difficult to awaken from. **Prachalā** is the sleep that comes while sitting, and **Prachalā-Prachalā** is the sleep that comes while walking. **Styānaddhi** or **Styānagṛddhi** is the sleep that comes due to the experience of very complex karma-paramāṇus. In this deep sleep, the jīva gains many times more power than its own and often performs extraordinary tasks that it thought of during the day. 

The nature of **Chakṣudarśanāvaraṇa** etc. is as follows: 

* **Chakṣudarśanāvaraṇa-netra** - The covering of the normal use of vision through the eye.
* **Prachakṣudarśanāvaraṇa-netra** - The covering of the normal use of other senses besides the eye.
* **Avadhidarśanāvaraṇa** - The covering of **avadhidarśana**.
* **Kevaladarśanāvaraṇa** - The prevention of the arising of **kevaladarśana**.

The effect of the arising of **darśanāvaraṇīyakarma** is that, like **jñānāvaraṇīyakarma**, the arising of **darśanāvaraṇīyakarma** itself or the arising of **darśanāvaraṇīyakarma** instigated by another covers the attainment and use of the senses. This leads to the destruction of the previous results of vision, causing the jīva to be unable to see even the objects that are visible to the senses. Thus, the arising of **darśanāvaraṇīyakarma** causes various kinds of damage to the previous qualities of vision.

**Eightfold Experience of Sātāvedanīya and Asātāvedanīya Karma:**

The text mentions eight types of experiences of both **sātāvedanīya** and **asātāvedanīya** karma. The causes of these experiences are the same as those related to **jñānāvaraṇīyakarma**.

**The nature of the eightfold experience of sātāvedanīya karma:**

1. The attainment of pleasing sounds of veṇu, vīṇā, etc.
2. The attainment of pleasing forms.
3. The attainment of pleasing fragrances like perfume, sandalwood, fruits, etc.
4. The attainment of pleasing, delicious tastes.
5. The attainment of pleasing touches.
6. The experience of happiness in the mind.
7. Pleasantness in speech, whose mere sound produces delight in the ears and mind.
8. Pleasantness of the body.

These eight types of experiences arise from the arising of **sātāvedanīyakarma**.

**Parinimittaka Sātāvedanīyakarma Udaya:**

When one consumes (veda) one or many pudgalas like a garland, sandalwood, etc., or when one consumes (veda) pudgala-parināma in the form of food according to the country, time, age, and stage, or when one consumes (veda) the desired pudgala-parināma as needed to counteract the experience of cold, heat, wind, etc. of pudgalas by nature, which brings about mental tranquility and happiness, this is the experience of **sātāvedanīyakarma** arising from the arising of **parinimittaka sātāvedanīyakarma**.

As a result of **sātāvedanīyakarma**, one experiences **sātā-sukha** (pleasantness). When **sātāvedanīyakarma** arises spontaneously, sometimes one experiences **sukha-sātā** (pleasantness) even without pleasing sounds, etc. (parinimitta). For example, when a Tīrthankara Bhagavān is born, even the naraka jīvas experience pleasantness for a short time.

## Twenty-third Karma-pada: Asatavedaniya Karma

Asatavedaniya karma is similar to the eightfold experience (vipaka) of the sevenfold experience (satavedaniya), but it is opposite to the satavedaniya experience. When the body experiences the pain of substances like poison, weapons, thorns, etc., or the pain of unhealthy or bland food, or the pain of natural occurrences like cold, heat, and sunstroke, the mind becomes unfocused, the body experiences pain, and the speech also expresses the pain. This is the experience of Asatavedaniya karma. The arising of Asatavedaniya karma results in a painful (duhkharupa) fruit. This is the explanation of the arising of Asatavedaniya karma. However, the pain experienced due to the arising of Asatavedaniya karma-pudgalas without any external cause is the natural arising of Asatavedaniya karma.

## Fivefold Experience of Mohamiya Karma: What, Why, and How?

As explained earlier, there are five types of experiences of the specific Mohamiya karma bound to the soul: (1) Samyaktva-vedaniya, (2) Mithyatva-vedaniya, (3) Samyag-Mithyatva-vedaniya, (4) Kshaya-vedaniya, and (5) No-Kshaya-vedaniya. Their nature is as follows:

* **Samyaktva-vedaniya:** The Mohamiya karma that is capable of being experienced as Samyaktva (right faith) is called Samyaktva-vedaniya. This means that the experience of this karma leads to the result of calmness, etc.
* **Mithyatva-vedaniya:** The Mohamiya karma that is capable of being experienced as Mithyatva (wrong faith) is called Mithyatva-vedaniya. This means that the experience of this karma leads to a distorted view, i.e., believing in gods, etc., where there are none.
* **Samyaktva-Mithyatva-vedaniya:** The karma that leads to a mixed result of Samyaktva and Mithyatva is called Samyaktva-Mithyatva-vedaniya.
* **Kshaya-vedaniya:** The karma that causes the experience of anger, etc., is called Kshaya-vedaniya.
* **No-Kshaya-vedaniya:** The karma that causes the experience of laughter, etc., is called No-Kshaya-vedaniya.

## Explanation of the Arising of Mohamiya Karma:

The experience of a particular substance or many substances, or the experience of a particular result of a substance, which is capable of absorbing a specific karma-pudgala and is in accordance with the place, time, and food, leads to the arising of Mohamiya karma. For example, the consumption of food like Brahmi leads to the destruction and calming of the Jnanavaraniya karma. This clearly shows that sometimes, the specific transformation of food can also bring about a change in the karma-pudgalas. It is also said:

"The arising, destruction, destruction-calming, and calming of karma, as mentioned, are caused by the substance, field, time, feeling, and existence, or they occur naturally." (1)

This means that the arising, destruction, destruction-calming, and calming of karma are caused by the substance, field, time, feeling, and existence, or they occur naturally. The experience of a particular result of a substance, like seeing the changes in clouds in the sky, causes a particular experience in humans.

## 24] The **Prajñāpanā Sūtra** (Viveka) states that the lifespan of humans is like the clouds of autumn, wealth is like the essence of a blossoming tree, and the enjoyment of sense objects is like the enjoyment of things seen in a dream. In truth, whatever appears pleasing in this world is merely an illusion, or it is the experience of **mohaniya karma** (karma that causes delusion) due to the influence of external objects that are the cause of **praśama** (tranquility) and other such things. This is the explanation of the **parataḥ mohaniya karma udaya** (the arising of mohaniya karma from external causes). **Svataḥ mohaniya karma udaya** (the arising of mohaniya karma from internal causes) is the experience of **mohaniya karma** (karma that causes delusion) due to the arising of **samyaktvavedaniya** (karma that causes the experience of right knowledge) and other **karma pudgalas** (particles of karma), which results in the experience of **praśama** (tranquility) and other such fruits.

**Anubhava of Āyu Karma** (Experience of Lifespan Karma): There are four types of **āyu karma anubhava** (experience of lifespan karma): **nairāyika āyu** (lifespan of hell beings), **tiryancha āyu** (lifespan of animals), **manuṣyāyu** (lifespan of humans), and **devāyu** (lifespan of gods).

**Parataḥ Āyu Karma Udaya** (The Arising of Lifespan Karma from External Causes): The experience of **śastra** (weapons) and other **pudgalas** (particles) that are capable of reducing lifespan, or the experience of **viṣa** (poison) and **anna** (food) and other **pudgalas** (particles) that are the result of **pariṇāma** (transformation), or the experience of **śīta** (cold) and **uṣṇa** (heat) and other **pudgalas** (particles) that naturally reduce lifespan, all cause a reduction in the lifespan being experienced. This is the explanation of the **parataḥ āyu karma udaya** (the arising of lifespan karma from external causes).

**Svataḥ Āyu Karma Udaya** (The Arising of Lifespan Karma from Internal Causes): The experience of **nārka āyu karma** (karma that causes the lifespan of hell beings) and other **karma pudgalas** (particles of karma) is the **svataḥ āyu karma udaya** (the arising of lifespan karma from internal causes).

**Niroopaṇa of Nāma Karma Anubhava** (Explanation of the Experience of Name Karma): There are two main types of **nāma karma** (name karma): **śubha nāma karma** (auspicious name karma) and **aśubha nāma karma** (inauspicious name karma). **Śubha nāma karma** (auspicious name karma) has 14 types of **anubhava** (experience) or **vipaka** (result). Their nature is as follows:

**Iṣṭa** (Desired) means desired or wished for. Since this is a discussion of **nāma karma**, we should understand this as referring to one's own words, etc. One's own desired words are **iṣṭa śabda** (desired words). Similarly, we should understand **iṣṭa rūpa** (desired form), **iṣṭa gandha** (desired smell), **iṣṭa rasa** (desired taste), and **iṣṭa sparśa** (desired touch). **Iṣṭa gati** (desired movement) has two meanings: (1) **devagati** (movement of gods) or **manuṣyagati** (movement of humans), or (2) excellent movement like that of an elephant, etc. **Iṣṭa sthiti** (desired position) means being seated on a desired and comfortable throne, etc. **Iṣṭa lāvaṇya** (desired beauty) means a desired special radiance or physical beauty. **Iṣṭa yaśa** (desired fame) is the fame that comes from displaying extraordinary prowess, and **iṣṭa kīti** (desired renown) is the fame that comes from giving charity, performing virtuous deeds, etc.

**Special Meaning of Uttāna, etc. (Six)**: **Uttāna** (rising) refers to bodily movement, **karma** (action) refers to movement like walking, etc., **bala** (strength) refers to physical strength, **vīrya** (vigor) refers to the power that arises from the soul, **puruṣakāra** (effort) refers to a special self-respect that arises from the soul, and **parākrama** (prowess) refers to the ability to achieve success in one's work.

**Iṣṭa svar** (desired voice) is a pleasing voice like that of a **vīṇā** (lute) or other musical instrument. **Kanta svar** (attractive voice) is a charming voice like that of a **kokila** (cuckoo). **Iṣṭa siddhi** (desired accomplishment) is a voice that is repeatedly desirable, like the voice of a **siddhi** (perfected being). **Priya svar** (beloved voice) is a voice that is pleasing to the ear, like the voice of a **siddhi** (perfected being). **Manojña svar** (pleasing voice) is a voice that produces joy in the listener, like the voice of a **siddhi** (perfected being).

**Parataḥ and Svataḥ Udaya of Śubha Nāma Karma** (The Arising of Auspicious Name Karma from External and Internal Causes): The experience of **vīṇā** (lute), **veṇu** (flute), **varṇa** (color), **gandha** (smell), **tāmbūla** (betel nut), **paṭṭāmbara** (robe), **pālakhī** (palanquin), **simhāsana** (throne), and other auspicious **pudgalas** (particles) is the **parataḥ śubha nāma karma udaya** (the arising of auspicious name karma from external causes).

Page #1220:
---------------------------
[25th Karma-pada] (Pudgalas) are indicated by the desire for words, etc. Or, the Pudgala-parinama, which is the result of the consumption of Brahmo medicine, etc., is experienced. Or, the Pudgala-parinama of auspicious Pudgalas is experienced by seeing the hue of auspicious clouds, etc., or by seeing the gathering of clouds. For example, when young women see the gathering of clouds during the rainy season, they are inclined to sing in a pleasing voice. The effect of this is the experience of auspicious name-karma. That is, the experience of a pleasing voice, etc., is the result of auspicious name-karma. This is the rise of auspicious name-karma due to external causes. When the experience of auspicious name-karma, such as pleasing words, etc., arises from the rise of Pudgalas of auspicious name-karma, then one should understand that name-karma itself has arisen. The experience of inauspicious name-karma is also of 14 types, as before, but it is the opposite of auspicious name-karma. For example, the experience of inauspicious Pudgalas or Pudgalas, such as unpleasant words, etc., is experienced from the words, etc., of a donkey, camel, dog, etc., because unpleasant words, etc., arise from their association. All this should be understood in the opposite way from the aforementioned auspicious name-karma. Or, the Pudgala-parinama, which is the result of the consumption of poison, etc., or the Pudgala-parinama, which is the result of the natural occurrence of a thunderbolt, etc., is experienced, and the effect of this is the experience of an unpleasant voice, etc., as a result of inauspicious name-karma. This is the experience of the rise of inauspicious name-karma due to external causes. Where the experience of unpleasant words, etc., arises from the Pudgalas of inauspicious name-karma, there one should understand that inauspicious name-karma itself has arisen. The experience of Gotra-karma: Distinction, types, causes - There are mainly two types of Gotra-karma: high Gotra and low Gotra. The experience (vedana) of the distinctiveness of high caste, family, strength, form, penance, knowledge, profit, and wealth is the experience of high Gotra, and the experience of the distinctiveness of low caste, etc., is the experience of low Gotra. Experience of high Gotra: How and due to what causes? - Due to the association of that particular substance, or due to the association of a distinguished man like a king, etc., a man born in a low caste also becomes popular like a man of high caste and family. This is the distinctiveness of caste and family. The distinctiveness of strength also arises due to the association of a distinguished man like a wrestler, etc. For example, the strength of wrestlers is generated by swinging wood, this is the distinctiveness of strength. The distinctiveness of form is generated by special types of clothes and ornaments. The distinctiveness of penance is generated in one who stands on the top of a mountain and endures heat, etc. The distinctiveness of knowledge is generated in one who studies in a beautiful region. The distinctiveness of profit is generated due to the association of precious, excellent gems, etc. The distinctiveness of wealth is generated due to the association of wealth, gold, etc. Thus, the experience of auspicious Pudgalas or Pudgalas in the form of external substances, or the experience of the Pudgala-parinama, which is the result of the consumption of divine fruits, etc., or the experience of the result of Pudgalas, which is naturally experienced in the form of the arrival of a stream of water, etc., is the experience of the fruit of high Gotra-karma. These are the causes of the rise of high Gotra-karma due to external causes. In the spontaneous rise of high Gotra-karma, the rise of Pudgalas of high Gotra-karma is the cause. 1.

## 26] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra, Nīcagotra Anu-bhāva: Types and Causes - As before, Nīcagotra Anu-bhāva is also of 8 types, and the fruit of Nīcagotra is exactly opposite to the fruit of Uccagotra / For example, Jāti-vihīnata, etc. / Jāti-kula-vihīnata - The experience of the Pudgala or Pudgalas in the form of contact with the lowest Karma or the lowest man, such as, due to Adharma Karma, a person of the highest lineage and caste indulges in the lowest livelihood or the service of a Chandala woman, then he becomes as condemnable as a Chandala, this is Jāti-kula-vihīnata / Due to the absence of the yoga of Sukhashayya, etc., there is weakness. Due to the yoga of contaminated food, bad clothes, etc., there is ugliness. Due to contact with wicked people, there is a lack of Tapas. Due to contact with Sadhvābhāsa, etc., there is a lack of Śruta. Due to unfavorable Kūkra (wrong purchase), etc., due to country, time, etc., there is a lack of profit. Due to contact with a bad house and a Kulata woman, etc., there is a lack of wealth. Or, the experience of the Pudgala-pariṇāma in the form of food like eggplant, etc., because eating eggplant causes itching, and from that, ugliness arises. Or, the experience of the Ashubha Pudgala-pariṇāma by nature, such as the discord related to the arrival of the water stream, from its influence, also due to the fruit of Nīcagotra Karma, the experience of Jāti-vihīnata, etc. This is the explanation of the Parata: Nīcagotra Karma Udaya. In the Svata: Nīcagotra Udaya, the Udaya of the Pudgalas of Nīcagotra Karma is the cause. From that, the experience of Jāti-vihīnata, etc., is experienced. ' Antarāya Karma's Fivefold Anu-bhāva: Form and Cause - Obstruction in giving is Dāna Antarāya, experiencing obstacles in profit is Lābha Antarāya, similarly, obstruction in Bhoga, Upbhoga, and Vīrya is Bhoga Antarāya, etc. The experience of specific Pudgala or Pudgalas like Ratna, etc., is experienced, as long as the Udaya of Dāna Antarāya Karma happens in that subject due to the connection with specific Ratna, etc., Pudgalas. Due to the connection with tools like digging, etc., Lābha Antarāya Karma Udaya happens. Due to the connection with a specific type of food or the meaning of non-food, due to greed, Bhoga Antarāya Karma Udaya happens. Similarly, one should understand the Udaya of Upbhoga Antarāya Karma. Due to the injury of wood, weapons, etc., Vīrya Antarāya Udaya happens / Or, due to the experience of the Pudgala-pariṇāma of specific food-medicine, from that, that is, due to the Pariṇāma of specific types of food and medicine, etc., Vīrya Antarāya Karma Udaya happens / Or, due to the experience of the Pariṇāma of the strange cold, etc., Pudgalas by nature, Dāna Antarāya, etc., Karma Udaya happens. For example, a person wants to donate clothes, etc., but seeing the arrival of heat, cold, etc., he is unable to donate, he becomes a giver / This is the explanation of Parata: Dāna Antarāya, etc., Karma Udaya / In the Svata: Dāna Antarāya, etc., Karma Udaya, then due to the Udaya of the Pudgalas of Antarāya Karma, the experience (Anu-bhāva) of the fruit of Dāna Antarāya, etc., Antarāya Karma happens. // Twenty-third Karma-Prakriti Pada: First Uddeshaka Ends // 1.

Such as - dana-antaryay yavat virya-antaryay karma / Vivechan - Uttar-karma-prakritiya - In the first Uddeshak, after describing the experience of the 8 original karma-prakritis, namely jnana-avaraneya, etc., in the second Uddeshak, first of all (from Sutra 1676 to 1666), the differences of Uttar-karma-prakritis according to the original karma-prakritis have been described. 'The nature of Uttar-karma-prakritis - (1) There are five Uttar-bhedas of jnana-avaraneya karma / Prabhinibodhik (mati) jnana-avaran, which karma covers Prabhinibodhik jnana, i.e., mati-jnana, is called Prabhinibodhik jnana-avaran / Similarly, one should understand about Shruta-jnana-avaran, etc. (2) Darshan-avaraneya karma - The general dharma of the substance, the perception of existence is called Darshan / The karma that covers Darshan is called Darshan-avaran / There are two types of Darshan-avaran - Nidra-panchak and Darshan-chatushk. The nature of the five types of Nidra-panchak has been mentioned in the first Uddeshak.

Keval-darshan-avaran - The karma that covers the knowledge of the general dharma of all dravyas is called Keval-darshan-avaran / Here it is to be known that Nidra-panchak is the upholder of the acquired Darshan-shakti, while Darshan-chatushk is the destroyer of Darshan-labdhi from the root.

## 34] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra (3) Vedaniyakarma - Karma that causes the experience (vedanā) of the objects of the senses is called Vedaniyakarma / The experience of pleasure and pain that the soul undergoes due to Vedaniyakarma is the sensory experience of pleasure and pain. The natural experience of pleasure that the soul has does not arise from karma-udaya. Its nature is like licking the honey-coated edge of a sword. It has two main types: (1) Sātāvedaniyā - Karma whose udaya causes the soul to experience pleasure related to sense objects is called Sātāvedaniyakarma / (2) Asātāvedaniyā - Karma whose udaya causes the soul to experience pain in obtaining favorable objects and unfavorable sense objects is called Asātāvedaniyā / Sātāvedaniyā has variations in its text like manojña words, etc., and conversely, Asātāvedaniyā also has variations in its text like amonojña words, etc. / Their meaning has been written before. (4) Mohaniyakarma - Just as a person intoxicated by alcohol forgets his own welfare, similarly, karma whose udaya causes the jīva to lose the intelligence to recognize and discern his true nature and welfare, and even if he gains the intelligence to discern welfare, he does not gain the ability to act accordingly, is called Mohaniyakarma / It has two main divisions - Darshanamohaniya and Charitramohaniya / Darshanamohaniya - To understand a substance as it is, in its true form, to have faith in Tattvārtha is called Darshan. Karma that destroys (praāvṛt) this personal Darshanaguna of the soul is called Darshanamohaniya. Charitramohaniya - To attain the nature of the soul or to delight in it is Charitra, or the result of the soul in the form of withdrawal from the world with caution and engagement in nirāvadyayoga is Charitra. Karma that destroys this Charitraguna of the soul is called Charitramohaniya. _ Darshanamohaniyakarma has three divisions - Samyaktva Vedaniyā, Mithyātva Vedaniyā and Samyagmithyātva Vedaniyā / These are called pure, impure and semi-pure respectively / Karma that does not hinder Samyaktva in the form of Tattvaruchi, but does not allow for the attainment of the natural state of the soul, which is Aupaśamika and Kṣayika Samyaktva, due to which doubt arises in considering the nature of capable substances, and impurities, dirt, and deep defects arise in Samyaktva, is Samyaktva Vedaniyā (Mohaniyā) / Karma whose udaya causes the jīva to have no interest in the true nature of the Tattvas, i.e., it is experienced as a lack of faith in Tattvārtha, is called Mithyātva Mohaniyā. Karma whose udaya causes the jīva to have neither interest nor disinterest in the Tattvas (reality) or in the Tattvas taught by the Jinas, or neither faith nor lack of faith, but remains in a mixed state, is called Samyaktva Mithyātva Vedaniyā (Mohaniyā) or Miśramohaniyā. (5) Charitramohaniyakarma: Bhev and Svarūpa - Charitramohaniyakarma have two main divisions - Kaṣāyavedaniyā (Mohaniyā) and Nokaṣāyavedaniyā (Mohaniyā). Kaṣāyavedaniyā - Karma that is experienced in the form of anger, pride, deceit and greed is called Kaṣāyavedaniyā. The characteristic of Kaṣāya is described in the Viśeṣāvaśyaka Bhāṣya as follows - That which destroys the qualities of the soul or Kaṣa, i.e., the cycle of birth and death, the attainment of which is caused by it, is called Kaṣāya.

## Twenty-Third Karma-pada [35]

**Maya and Lobha, these are four divisions:**

* **Krodha:**  To be filled with anger, forgetting equanimity, and to be enraged at another.
* **Mana:** Pride, arrogance, or false self-display.
* **Maya:** Deceitfulness, meaning the absence of thought and uniformity.
* **Lobha:** The result of attachment.

**Due to the intense, very intense, intense, and mild states of this quartet of Kshaya, there can be four types each. They are respectively Ananta-anubandhi (most intense state), Apratyakhyana-avaran (very intense state), Pratyakhyana-avaran (intense state), and Sanjwalan (mild state).**

**Their characteristics are as follows:**

* **Ananta-anubandhi:** The Kshaya that destroys the virtues of the Jiva, such as Samyak-tva, and causes it to wander in the world for an infinite time.
* **Apratyakhyana-avaran:** The Kshaya that destroys the Desha-virati Charitra (Shravakapan) of the Atma, meaning that the Pratyakhyana, which is the partial abandonment of Desha-virati, cannot be achieved due to its arising.
* **Pratyakhyana-avaran:** The Kshaya whose influence hinders the Atma from attaining Sarva-virati Charitra, meaning that it prevents the attainment of Shraman-dharma.
* **Sanjwalan:** The Kshaya whose arising prevents the Atma from attaining Yatha-khyata Charitra, meaning that it influences the observance of Shraman-dharma through Pari-shaha and Upa-sarga.

**By combining these four with the four Kshayas of Krodha, etc., there are 16 divisions of Kshaya-mohaniya.**

* **Ananta-anubandhi Krodha:** Like the crack caused by the bursting of a mountain, which does not subside even with remedies.
* **Apratyakhyana-avaran Krodha:** Like the crack in dry soil that fills up again with water, this Krodha subsides with some effort and remedy.
* **Pratyakhyana-avaran Krodha:** Like a line drawn on dust (sand) that fills up with wind after some time, this Krodha subsides with some remedy.
* **Sanjwalan Krodha:** Like a line drawn on water that subsides immediately, this Krodha subsides immediately.

* **Ananta-anubandhi Mana:** Just as it is impossible to bend a stone pillar even with hard work, this Mana never goes away.
* **Apratyakhyana-avaran Mana:** To bend a bone, one needs to work hard and also use remedies, similarly, this Mana goes away with extreme effort and remedies.
* **Pratyakhyana-avaran Mana:** Dry wood becomes soft with oil and massage, similarly, this Mana goes away with some effort and remedy.
* **Sanjwalan Mana:** Like a cane that bends without effort, this Mana immediately abandons its attachment.

* **Ananta-anubandhi Maya:** The crookedness of the root of a bamboo cannot be straightened, similarly, this Maya cannot be removed.
* **Apratyakhyana-avaran Maya:** The horns of a ram cannot be straightened, similarly, this Maya cannot be removed.

**Prajñāpanā-sūtra curvature is removed by hard work and many efforts, just as māyā-parināma is removed by great effort and means.** / **Pratyākyānāvaraṇa māyā-moving like the curve of a bull's urine line, which is difficult to remove when it is crooked.** **Sanjvalanā-māyā-like the crookedness of a bamboo peel, which becomes straight without effort, so the māyā-bhāva is easily removed.** / **Anantānubandhī lobha-like the color of a worm, which cannot be removed by any means, so the result of that greed does not go away even after taking measures.** **Apratyākyānāvaraṇa-lobha-like the mud of a cart wheel, which is very difficult to remove, the result of greed.** / **Pratyākyānāvaraṇa lobha-like the color of kajal, the results of this greed are removed with some effort.** **Sanjvalana-lobha-like the color of turmeric, which is easily removed, the results of this greed are easily removed.** **No-kṣaya-vedaniya-which is not a kṣaya, but which arises with the rise of kṣaya, or which helps to stimulate kṣaya.** **What is known as no-kṣaya, such as strī-veda, is no-kṣaya-vedaniya.** **There are three types of no-kṣaya-vedaniya: strī-veda-the karma which arises from the desire to have sexual intercourse with a man.** / **Purusha-veda-the karma which arises from the desire to have sexual intercourse with a woman.** **Napumsaka-veda-the karma which arises from the desire to have sexual intercourse with both men and women.** **The lust of these three vedas is like kariṣāgni (fire of cow dung), tṛṇāgni (fire of grass) and nagaradāha (fire of a city) respectively.** **Hāsya-the karma which arises from laughter due to a reason or without a reason, or from making others laugh.** / **Rati-arati-the karma which arises from raga-prīti (love-attachment) or dveṣa-aprīti (hatred-detachment) towards objects due to a reason or without a reason.** / **Śoka-the karma which arises from sorrow due to a reason or without a reason.** **Bhaya-the karma which arises from fear of any kind due to a reason or without a reason.** **Jugupsā-the karma which arises from disgust at the sight of repulsive objects.** **Prāyu-karma: nature, type and special meaning-the karma which arises from the life of a being as a deva, man, tiryañc and naraka, and which is destroyed when it dies, is called āyu-karma.** **There are four types of āyu-karma, which are mentioned in the original text.** **The nature of prāyu-karma is like a prison.** **Just as a criminal, even if he wants to be released, cannot be released from prison until his term is over, so too, due to āyu-karma, a being has to live for a certain period of time.** 1.

## Twenty-third Karma-pada:

**[37] One has to reside in the hells and other states of existence. Only after experiencing the bound lifespan, one gets liberation from that body. / The function of Ayukarma is not to give happiness or sorrow to the soul, but to keep it in a particular body for a fixed period. / Its nature is like a fetter (khoda-bedi).**

**Namakarma:** Form, type, and characteristics - The karma whose arising causes the soul to attain hell, animal, human, and celestial states, and to experience various good and bad states, or by which the soul experiences motion, etc., or various states, or body, etc., is called Namakarma. / There are 103, 63, or 42, or 67 divisions of Namakarma according to different perspectives. In the present sutras, 42 divisions of Namakarma are mentioned, which are mentioned in the original text. / Their characteristics are as follows: (1) **Gati-Namakarma** - The arising of which causes the soul to go to human, etc., states, or to attain the state of hell, animal, human, or celestial. The result in the form of hell, etc., is called Gati. There are 4 divisions of Gati, hell, etc. / The Namakarma that produces these states is called Gati-Namakarma. (2) **Jati-Namakarma** - The similar culmination (state of oneness) that occurs in the form of one-sense, etc., beings, is called Jati. / The soul acquires one, two, three, four, or five senses out of the five senses of touch, taste, etc., and is called one-sense, etc. The karma that is the cause of this type of Jati is called Jati-Namakarma. (3) **Sharira-Namakarma** - That which is constantly decaying (decaying moment by moment) is called Sharira. / The karma that generates bodies is Sharira-Namakarma. / That is, the karma whose arising causes the attainment of gross, subtle, etc., bodies, i.e., these bodies are formed. / There are 5 divisions of Sharira-Namakarma according to the divisions of bodies. (4) **Sharira-Angopaanga-Namakarma** - There are 8 limbs of the body, such as the brain. It is also said, 'Sise-muro-yer-pitthi-do-baahu-aruy-a-atthaga.' That is, head, chest, abdomen, back, two arms, and two thighs, these are the eight limbs of the body. / The limbs of these limbs, such as fingers, etc., are called Upaanga, and their limbs, such as the joints of the fingers, etc., are Angopaanga. The karma whose arising causes the transformation of pudgalas in the form of limbs, Upaanga, etc., i.e., the karma that is the cause of Angopaanga, is Angopaanga-Namakarma. This karma is only of three types, because there are no Angopaanga in the Tejas and Karman bodies. (5) **Sharira-Bandhana-Namakarma** - By which the body is bound, i.e., the karma that creates a relationship between the previously acquired gross, etc., body and the gross, etc., pudgalas to be acquired in the present, i.e., with the Tejas, etc., pudgalas, is Sharira-Bandhana-Namakarma. (6) **Sharira-Sanhanana-Namakarma** - The specific structure of bones is called Sanhanana. Sanhanana can only occur in the gross body, not in other bodies, because other bodies do not have bones. Therefore, the karma whose arising causes the joints of the bones in the body to be strong is called Sanhanana-Namakarma. 1.

The nature of Gotra Karma is like the potter who makes the 23rd Karma-pada. There are differences in the paths of the high and low Gotras.

Antarayakarma: Nature, Types and Characteristics - Karma which, upon its arising, causes obstruction (hindrance) to the living being in giving, receiving, enjoying, using, and vigor (prowess), is called Antarayakarma. There are 5 types of this. Their characteristics are as follows:

Dana Antarayakarma - When the material for giving is present, a worthy recipient is available to receive the gift, the fruit of the gift is also known, and there is a desire to give, yet the living being is unable to give due to the arising of this karma, it is called Dana Antarayakarma.

Labha Antarayakarma - When the giver is generous, the object to be given is also present, and the receiver is also a skilled and worthy recipient, yet the living being does not receive the desired object due to the arising of this karma, it is called Labha Antarayakarma.

Bhoga Antarayakarma - Things that are enjoyed once are called 'Bhoga', such as food, etc. Even though there are various means of enjoyment, the living being is unable to enjoy the enjoyable things due to the arising of this karma, it is called Bhoga Antarayakarma.

Upbhoga Antarayakarma - Things that are enjoyed repeatedly are called Upbhoga, such as houses, clothes, ornaments, etc. Even though there are means of Upbhoga, the living being is unable to enjoy those means of Upbhoga due to the arising of this karma, it is called Upbhoga Antarayakarma.

Veerya Antarayakarma - Veerya means prowess, strength, effort. Even though the living being is healthy, strong, capable, and young, due to the arising of this karma, the living being is unable to exert prowess in a particular task, unable to use strength and capability, due to low vitality, low spirits, laziness, and weakness, it is called Veerya Antarayakarma.

Thus, the description of the divisions and subdivisions of the paths and karmas is from Sutra 1687 to 1666.

The state of the two Karma-prakritis is described in 1667.

"Nāṇāvaraṇijjassa ṇam bhanta! kammarasa kevatiyam kālam ṭhiṭī paṇṇattā? goyamā! jahaṇṇeṇaṁ antomuhuttaṁ, ukkosenaṁ tīsaṁ sāgarovamkoḍākoḍīo; tiṇṇi ya vāsasahasssāi abāhā, prabāhuṇiyā kammathiṭī kammaniśego." [1697 pra.]

"Bhagavan! How long is the state of Jnanavaraniya Karma said to be?" [1697 u.]

"Gautama! (Its state) is the shortest, an Antarmuhurta, and the highest is thirty Koḍa 1. (a) Ibid., Bha. 5, pp. 275-76 (b) Karmagrantha, Bha. 1, (Maru. Vya.) p. 151 2. (a) Ibid., Bha. 5, p. 151, (b) Prajñāpanā (Prameyabodhinīṭīkā), Bha. 5, pp. 277-78"

42) The Prajñāpanā Sūtra compares the duration of karma to the ocean. Its uninterrupted period is three thousand years. The period of karma-niṣeka is the remaining time after subtracting the uninterrupted period from the total duration of karma. 1698. [1] "O Bhagavan! How long is the duration of the Niddrāpañcaka (Darsanāvaraṇīya) karma?" [1698.1 U.] "Gautama! Its duration is three parts of the Sagaropama, minus an innumerable part of the Palyopama, for the lowest, and thirty Kodakodi Sagaropama for the highest. Its uninterrupted period is three thousand years, and the remaining time after subtracting the uninterrupted period from the total duration of karma is the period of karma-niṣeka." [1698.1 Pr.] "O Bhagavan! How long is the duration of the Darśanacatuṣka (Darsanāvaraṇīya) karma?" [1698.2 U.] "Gautama! Its duration is one Antarmukutta for the lowest, and thirty Kodakodi Sagaropama for the highest. Its uninterrupted period is three thousand years." [1698.2 Pr.] 1666. [1] "O Bhagavan! How long is the duration of the Sātāvedanīya karma?" [1666.1 U.] "Gautama! Its duration is two moments for the lowest, and twelve Muhurtas for the highest, in comparison to the Iryāpathika bandhaka. Its duration is twelve Muhurtas for the lowest, and fifteen Kodakodi Sagaropama for the highest, in comparison to the Sāmprāyika bandhaka. Its uninterrupted period is fifteen hundred years." [1666.1 Pr.] "O Bhagavan! How long is the duration of the Asātāvedanīya karma?" [1666.2 U.] "Gautama! Its duration is three parts of the Sagaropama, minus an innumerable part of the Palyopama, for the lowest, and thirty Kodakodi Sagaropama for the highest. Its uninterrupted period is three thousand years." [1666.2 Pr.]

[Twenty-third Karma-pada] [55 [1702-57 U.] Gautama! Its inferior and superior states have been said to be like the Koḍakoḍī Sagaropama. [58] And where there is one part of the Sagaropama, there the superior state is ten Koḍakoḍī Sagaropama and the unobstructed time is ten hundred (one thousand) years. And where there are two parts of the Sagaropama, there the superior state is twenty Koḍakoḍī Sagaropama and the unobstructed time is twenty hundred (two thousand) years. 1702-58] Where (the inferior state is like the Sagaropama): one part, there the superior state is ten Koḍakoḍī Sagaropama and the unobstructed time is ten hundred (one thousand) years. And where (the inferior state is like the Sagaropama): two parts, there the superior state is twenty Koḍakoḍī Sagaropama and the unobstructed time is twenty hundred (two thousand) years. 1703.

Its inferior state is antarmūhūrta and its superior state is thirty Koḍakoḍī Sagaropama and its unobstructed time is three thousand years. And the remaining karma-state after the unobstructed time is the karma-niṣekakāla. Discussion–In this section (from sū. 1697 to 1704), the inferior and superior states of the Jñānāvaraṇīya karma to the Antarāyakarma (including the original Uttaraka karma-types) have been described. Also, in the form of an explanation of an unasked question, the unobstructed time and the niṣekakāla of all these karmas have been mentioned. 1.

**The state of a soul bound by karma, along with its various classifications, is called "sthiti" (state). This is also known as "sthitibandha" in the literature on karma. The state of karma in its most excellent form is called "karmरूपतावस्थानरूप स्थिति" (state of karma in its most excellent form).**

**When karma is bound, it does not immediately start to bear fruit. It remains dormant for some time. This period of dormancy, where karma does not bear fruit, is called "abaadhakal" (period of dormancy).**

**From the time of binding (bandhasamaya) until the end of the "abaadhakal", the bound karma does not cause any hindrance to the soul. This is because the karma particles (karmadalika) do not mature (niseka) during this period. The period of time remaining after the "abaadhakal" is subtracted from the most excellent state of karma is called the "karmniseka" (maturation of karma) or "anubhavayogyasthiti" (state of experiencing) period.**

**The diagram on pages 57-61 shows the lowest and highest states of each karma, along with the "abaadhakal" and "niseka" periods. The following is a description of the binding state of the "jnanaavaran" (knowledge-obscuring) karma in one-sensed beings (ekendriya jivas):**

**[1705. Egidiya nam bhanta! Jivaa naanavaranijjasas kammaas ki bandhati? Goyama! Jahananam sagarovamaas tiini sattabhage palinovamaas asankhejjai bhaagenaa uunaye, ukkosenaa te cheva padipunne bandhati / 61705 pra.]**

**[1705 u.] Gautama! They bind the "jnanaavaran" karma for a period of time that is less than one-third of the "sagaropama" (ocean-like) period, but more than an innumerable fraction of the "palyopama" (pulse-like) period. In its most excellent form, they bind it for the entire "sagaropama" period.**

**[1706. Evam nihaapanchakasas vi dansasacaukkasas vi.]**

**[1706] Similarly, the binding of the "nidraapanchaka" (five types of sleep) and "darsanacatuष्ka" (four types of perception) should be understood to be the same as that of the "jnanaavaran" karma.**

**[1707. [1] Egidiya nam bhanta! Jivaa saataaveyanijjasas kammaas ki bandhati? Goyama! Jahananam sagarovamaas divadhham sattabhagam palishrovamaas asankhejjai bhaagenaa uunayam, ukkosenaa tam cheva padipunnam bandhati / [1707-1 pra.]**

**[1707-1 u.] Gautama! They bind the "saataavedaniya" (pain-producing) karma for a period of time that is less than one-sixth of the "sagaropama" period, but more than an innumerable fraction of the "palyopama" period. In its most excellent form, they bind it for the entire "sagaropama" period.**

**1707. [2]** Just as the knowledge-obscuring karma (**jñānāvaraṇīya**) is considered to be **asāyāveyaṇīya**, so too should the **asātāvedanīya** karma (both **jghanya** and **utkṛṣṭa**) be known.

**1708. [1]** **Eka-indriya** beings, **Bhante**, how long do they bind **samyaktva-vedanīya** karma? **Gautama**: They do not bind it at all.

**[5]** Similarly, they bind from **krodha-sanjvalanā** to **lobha-sanjvalanā**.

**[6]** The binding time of **strī-veda** karma is the same as that of **sātāvedanīya** karma (as mentioned in **Sūtra 1707-1**).

**[7]** **Eka-indriya** beings, **Bhante**, how long do they bind **puruṣa-veda** karma? **Gautama**: They bind it for a time as small as one part in an **asankhyeya** number of **palyopamas** compared to a **sāgaropama** time, and for a time as large as a full **sāgaropama**.

##  The Binding of Karmic Conditions in Two-Sensed Beings (Dwi-Indriya) from the Prajnapana Sutra

**1715.**  "O Bhagavan! How long do two-sensed beings bind the karma of knowledge-obscuring (Jnana-Avaraniya)? "

**1715.** "Gautama! They bind for a time that is less than an inconceivable number of parts of a Palya-upam, which is twenty-five times less than a Sagara-upam, and in the highest case, they bind for the full duration."

**1716.** "Similarly, one should know the state of the five-fold sleep (Nidra-Panchaka) - sleep, sleeplessness, restlessness, extreme restlessness, and dullness."

**1717.** "Just as the binding state of one-sensed beings (Eka-Indriya) has been described, so too should the binding state of two-sensed beings be described. Where the one-sensed beings do not bind (certain karmic conditions), these (two-sensed beings) also do not bind them."

**1718.** "O Bhagavan! How long do two-sensed beings bind the karma of false belief (Mithyatva-Vedaniya)?"

**1718.** "Gautama! They bind for a time that is less than an inconceivable number of parts of a Palya-upam, which is twenty-five times less than a Sagara-upam, and in the highest case, they bind for the full duration."

**1719.** "Two-sensed beings bind the karma of the animal lifespan (Tiryak-Joniya) for a minimum of an Antarmukha (a very short time) and in the highest case, for four years more than a Purva-Kodi-Varsha (a hundred million years)."

**1720.** "Similarly, one should know the binding state of the human lifespan (Manushya-Ayus). The rest, up to the karma of obstruction (Antaraya), should be known in the same way as for the one-sensed beings."

Page #1262:
---------------------------
Twenty-third Karma-pada [67 are there? The solution to this question is given here. It will be easily understood from the diagram below - The name of Karma-prakriti, the lowest state of bondage, the highest state of bondage, the knowledge-obscuring, the five-fold sleep, the part of the Palya-upam, the countless part, the 25th part of the Sagara-upam, less than 25 parts of the Sagara-upam, the remaining karma, the bondage management like a one-sense being, knowing the false-belief-delusive, the countless part of the Palya-upam, the full 25 Sagara-upam, less than 25 Sagara-upam, the lifespan of a Tiryancha, the lifespan of a human, the interval of a moment, 4 previous, more previous, koti years, the name-lineage, the obstacles, etc., like a one-sense being, like a one-sense being, in comparison to one-sense beings, the characteristic of the bondage period of two-sense beings - one characteristic is that the bondage period of two-sense beings is 25 times more than that of one-sense beings / For example, the lowest bondage period of the knowledge-obscuring karma of a one-sense being is the countless part of the Palya-upam less than one part of the Sagara-upam, while the lowest bondage period of a two-sense being is the countless part of the Palya-upam less than 25 parts of the Sagara-upam / In this way, it should be understood as before by multiplying by 25 / The Karma-prakritis whose bondage is not done by one-sense beings, two-sense beings also do not bind them. Thus, whatever the highest state of a particular karma has been said before, the highest state of that state of the delusive karma is divided by 70 Kodakodi, the number obtained is multiplied by 25, the amount obtained from that, the countless part of the Palya-upam is subtracted, the quantity of the lowest state of two-sense beings is obtained. If the countless part of the Palya-upam is not subtracted from it, then the quantity of the highest state is obtained. For example, if the part of the Sagara-upam of the five-fold knowledge-obscuring, etc., is multiplied by 25, then it becomes 25 parts of the Sagara-upam. That is, their highest bondage period is the full 25 parts of the Sagara-upam / If the countless part of the Palya-upam is subtracted, then their lowest state bondage period is obtained. The state of Karma-prakritis in three-sense beings - bondage-formulation 1721. Teindaia nam bhanta! Jivaa paanavaranijjass ki bandhanti? Goayama! Jahannanam sagarovam pannsasae tini sattabhaaga paliyovamass asankhejjai bhaagena unaya, ukkosena te cev padipunne bandhanti / Evam jass jai bhaaga te tass sagarovam pannsasae sah bhaaniyavva / 1.

---------------------------
[1721 Q.]  O Bhagavan! How long do the two-sense beings bind the knowledge-obscuring karma? [1721 A.] Gautama! They bind it for a period less than fifty ocean-lengths by an immeasurable fraction of a moment-length in the lowest case, and in the highest case, they bind it for the full amount.  Thus, for whatever fraction they bind it, it should be said along with fifty ocean-lengths. 1722. [1722 Q.] O Bhagavan! How long do the three-sense beings bind the false-belief-producing karma? [1722 A.] Gautama! They bind it for a period less than fifty ocean-lengths by an immeasurable fraction of a moment-length in the lowest case, and in the highest case, they bind it for the full fifty ocean-lengths. 1723. The binding period of the four-sense beings is an inner moment in the lowest case, and in the highest case, it is sixteen nights and days, and a third part of a night and day more than a crore of previous ones.  Similarly, the binding period of the human beings is also the same. 1724. The binding period of the remaining beings, up to the intermediate ones, should be known to be the same as the binding period of the two-sense beings.  Discussion - The characteristic of the binding period of the three-sense beings - The description of the binding period of the three-sense beings is also similar, but their binding period is 50 times more than that of the one-sense beings.  The description of the binding period of the karma-natures of the four-sense beings 1725. [1725 Q.] O Bhagavan! How long do the four-sense beings bind the knowledge-obscuring karma? [1725 A.] Gautama! They bind it for a period less than one hundred ocean-lengths by an immeasurable fraction of a moment-length in the lowest case, and in the highest case, they bind it for the full one hundred ocean-lengths. 1.

## The Twenty-Third Karma-pada 1726.

The duration of the karma for the Tiryancha (animals) is the least, a fraction of a Palya-upam, and the greatest is two months more than a Koti-purva. Similarly, the duration of the karma for the Manusya (humans) should also be known. 1727. The duration of the karma for the Dwindriya (two-sense) beings should be known as the same as that of the Beindriya (two-sense) beings. However, the least duration of the karma for the Mithyatva-vedaniya (delusion-causing) is a fraction of a Palya-upam, less than a hundred Sagaro-upam, and the greatest is a full hundred Sagaro-upam. The rest of the statement is the same as that of the Dwindriya beings until the Antaray (obstruction) karma. Discussion: The duration of the karma for the Chaturindriya (four-sense) beings is a hundred times greater than that of the Ekendriya (one-sense) beings. 1728. Asanji (non-conscious) Panchendriya (five-sense) beings, Bhagavan! How long do they bind the Jnana-avaran (knowledge-obscuring) karma? Gotama! They bind it for a fraction of a Palya-upam, less than three-sevenths of a thousand Sagaro-upam, and the greatest is a full thousand Sagaro-upam. The same statement should be known here as that of the Beindriya beings. The special point is that in the case of the Asanji Panchendriya beings, the duration of the karma should be multiplied by a thousand Sagaro-upam for each part of the karma. 1729. They bind the Mithyatva-vedaniya karma for a fraction of a Palya-upam, less than a thousand Sagaro-upam, and the greatest is a full thousand Sagaro-upam. 1, (a) Pannavana Sutra, Part 1, p. 380 (b) Prajnapanasutra (Pramaye Bodhini Tika), Part 5, p. 421.

## Prajñāpanā Sūtra 1730. [1] The lowest duration of the bondage of hell-life is ten thousand years, and the highest is an immeasurable part of the Palyopama, which is three parts more than the previous koti. [1730-1] The karma of hell-life binds for a minimum of an antarmūhūrta and a maximum of ten thousand years, and the highest binds for an immeasurable part of the Palyopama, which is three parts more than the previous koti. [2] Similarly, the bondage of the life of a Tiryancha is also an immeasurable part of the Palyopama, which is three parts more than the previous koti, but the lowest is an antarmūhūrta. [1730-2] Similarly, the karma of the Tiryancha life also binds for an immeasurable part of the Palyopama, which is three parts more than the previous koti, but the lowest is an antarmūhūrta. [3] Similarly, one should understand the bondage of human life. [1730-3] Similarly, one should understand the bondage of human life. [4] The bondage of the life of a deva should be understood as being the same as that of hell-life. [1730-4] The bondage of the life of a deva should be understood as being the same as that of hell-life. 

1731. [1] "O Bhagavan! How long does the karma of the Asamjñīpancendriya jīva bind in the hell-life?" [1731-1 प्र.] "O Bhagavan! How long does the karma of the Asamjñīpancendriya jīva bind in the hell-life?" [1631-1 उ.] "Gautama! It binds for a part of the Palyopama, which is less than an immeasurable part of a thousand Sagaropama, and the highest binds for a full thousand Sagaropama." [1731-1 उ.] "Gautama! It binds for a part of the Palyopama, which is less than an immeasurable part of a thousand Sagaropama, and the highest binds for a full thousand Sagaropama." [2] Similarly, one should understand the bondage of the karma of the Tiryancha life. [1731-2] Similarly, one should understand the bondage of the karma of the Tiryancha life. [3] Similarly, one should understand the bondage of the karma of the human life. However, the lowest binds for a part of the Palyopama, which is less than an immeasurable part of a thousand Sagaropama, and the highest binds for a full thousand Sagaropama. [1731-3] Similarly, one should understand the bondage of the karma of the human life. However, the lowest binds for a part of the Palyopama, which is less than an immeasurable part of a thousand Sagaropama, and the highest binds for a full thousand Sagaropama. [4] Similarly, one should understand the bondage of the karma of the deva life. However, the lowest binds for a part of the Palyopama, which is less than an immeasurable part of a thousand Sagaropama, and the highest binds for a full thousand Sagaropama. [1731-4] Similarly, one should understand the bondage of the karma of the deva life. However, the lowest binds for a part of the Palyopama, which is less than an immeasurable part of a thousand Sagaropama, and the highest binds for a full thousand Sagaropama.

[71 Twenty-third Karma-pada] [5]  The question about the duration of the binding of the Vaikriya-śarīra-nāma karma. Gautama! The duration of the binding of the Vaikriya-śarīra-nāma karma for the (Asamjñī-pañcendriya jīva) is as follows: the lowest duration is equal to an immeasurable fraction of a thousand oceans, and the highest duration is equal to two full thousand oceans.  /  [1731-5 Pr.] Bhagavan!

The special difference is that their 'abadha kāla' and abadhā kālanyun (karma niseka kāla) are not called. In the same way, the state-binding time of all the karmas, up to the antarayakarma, should be said in sequence. Discussion - Some clarifications - The minimum state-binding time of the jnanavaraniya, etc. karmas, as compared to the sentient five-sensed beings, is the time when the binding of those karma-natures is at its peak. / The binding of the nidrapanchak, asatavedaniya, mithyatva, kshaya-dwadasha, etc. happens before the destruction, therefore, their minimum and maximum binding is also antahkotakot.

[74] The *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* compares the *Jñānāvaraṇīya* karma to the ocean, which is extremely complex and should be understood by those with a false view. The most excellent bondage of the four types of *āyuṣkarma* occurs in those who are extremely pure, in their respective binders. / 'The description of the lowest state binder of karma 1742. "Gautama! What is the lowest state binder of karma? " "Gautama! It is either a subtle *samprayā*, a *upaśāmaka* (of the *upaśama* category), or a *kṣapaka* (of the *kṣapaka* category). " "Gautama! This is the lowest state binder of *Jñānāvaraṇīya* karma, and there is a binder of a higher state than this." / In this way, with this understanding, one should speak about the remaining karmas, excluding *mohaniya* and *prāyuṣkarma*.

This is the lowest state binder of *Jñānāvaraṇīya* karma, and there is a binder of a higher state than this." 1743. "Bhagavan! Who is the lowest state binder of *mohaniya* karma?" 1743 U.] "Gautama! It is either a *bādarasamprayā*, a *upaśāmaka* (of the *upaśama* category), or a *kṣapaka* (of the *kṣapaka* category). " "Gautama!

Discussion-Conclusion- The lowest state binder of the remaining five karmas, excluding *mohaniya* and *āyuṣkarma*, is a *jīva* who is either a *sūkṣma-samprayā* (subtle *samprayā*) or a *kṣapaka* (of the *kṣapaka* category), or both. 1. *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* Part 5, (*Pramaẏabodhinī Ṭīkā*) pp. 433-434

The 23rd Karma-pada is the state where the binding of Karmas like Jnanavaranīya etc. is minimal in the subtle Samprayā state, both in the case of Upaśamaka and Kṣapaka. Therefore, since the time of their binding is the same, it is said that either Upaśamaka or Kṣapaka. Although the time of binding for both Upaśamaka and Kṣapaka is minimal, there is a difference in the duration of that minimal time. The binding time of Kṣapaka should be considered double that of Upaśamaka. For example, the binding time of Jnanavaranīya Karma for a Kṣapaka in the 10th Gunasthāna is half the binding time of Upaśamaka, which ascends to a higher level and then descends back to the 10th Gunasthāna. Even then, the time is minimal. Thus, while describing the Samprayāyika binding of Vedaniya Karma, the minimal binding time of Kṣapaka is said to be 12 Muhūrta and that of Upaśamaka is 24 Muhūrta. The Kṣapaka of Nāma and Gotra Karma binds for 8 Muhūrta, while the Upaśamaka binds for 16 Muhūrta. However, the minimal binding of both Upaśamaka and Kṣapaka should be considered the most minimal binding compared to all other bindings. Therefore, it is said that the Upaśamaka and Kṣapaka beings, who are in the subtle Samprayā state, are the minimal binders of Karmas like Jnanavaranīya etc. The binder of the minimal state of Mohaniya Karma is the Upaśamaka or Kṣapaka being who is associated with the Bādar Samprayā. Who is the binder of the minimal state of Prāyu Karma and why? The being who is Asankṣepya-Addhāpraviṣṭa has a completely restricted lifespan. His lifespan is the largest time according to the Prākṣa measure. As soon as Prāyu is bound, his lifespan ends. Therefore, the Asankṣepya-Addhāpraviṣṭa being binds the most minimal state at the peak time of lifespan binding, i.e., in the eighth part of a Prākṣa measure. That state is capable of fulfilling the needs of the body and senses, but incapable of fulfilling the needs of breathing. Here, Asankṣepya-Addhā, Sarvaniruddha, and Charmakāla are some technical terms, their characteristics are as follows: Asankṣepya-Addhā - the time that cannot be shortened in any way, such as in three parts, is called Asankṣepya-Addhā. The lifespan of such a being is Sarvaniruddha. That is, the lifespan is extremely shortened due to the causes of the undertaking. Such a lifespan is limited only to the time of lifespan binding, not beyond. Charmakāla time - this word should not be taken to mean a subtle part, but should be understood as the aforementioned time, because it is not possible for the binding of lifespan to occur in less time.

As the Vaanmantraadiya (from Vaanmantraadiya) to Vaimanika (to Vaimanika) are said to be bound by seven and other karma-prakritis (as in Su. 1758 [1]), so should it be said.]**

[1761 Pra. Bhagavan! (Many) humans, while binding the Jnanavaraniya karma, how many karma-prakritis do they bind? [1761 Ut.] Gautama! 1. All humans are bound by seven karma-prakritis, 2.

The rest, from Vaanmantraadiya (from Vaanmantraadiya) to Vaimanika (to Vaimanika), as they are said to be bound by seven and other karma-prakritis (as in Su. 1758-1), so should it be said.

**[1762. And just as it is said that those who bind the Jnanavaraniya karma also bind the Darshanavaraniya karma, so should it be said about the binding of those karma-prakritis in relation to the Jivaadiya (Jiva and others) with respect to unity and plurality.]**

**[1762] Just as it is said that those who bind the Jnanavaraniya karma also bind the Darshanavaraniya karma, so should it be said about the binding of those karma-prakritis in relation to the Jivaadiya (Jiva and others) with respect to unity and plurality.**

**Discussion -**

**The binding of other karma-prakritis along with the binding of Jnanavaraniya and Darshanavaraniya karma.**

**(1) How can the Samuccaya Jiva be bound by seven, eight, or six karma-prakritis?**

**~ When a Jiva binds the Jnanavaraniya karma, if it does not bind the Ayushya karma, then it binds seven prakritis. If it binds the Ayushya karma, then it binds the Paatha karma-prakriti. And when it does not bind both the Mohaniya and Ayushya, then it binds six karma-prakritis. Such Jivas are those who reside in the Sukhmasampraayagunasthan, who are bound by the remaining six karma-prakritis, excluding the Mohaniya and Ayushya. Only a Jiva residing in the eleventh (Upshanta-Mohaniya), twelfth (Ksheena-Mohaniya), and thirteenth (Sayogi-Kevali) gunasthanas binds only one Saataavedaniya karma-prakriti. / At that time, they bind the Saataavedaniya karma, which has two time-based states. / They do not have Sampraayik binding, because the Jnanavaraniya and other karmas of the Upshantakashaya and other Jivas are severed at the end of the tenth gunasthan, called Sukhmasampraay.**

## Translation:

**82** [Prajñāpanasūtra] When a Naraka (hell-being) binds the Karma of Knowledge-Obscuration, but does not bind the Karma of Life-Span, then it binds seven Karma-types. When it binds the Karma of Life-Span, then it becomes bound by eight Karma-types. / A Naraka being cannot have the option of binding six Karma-types, because it cannot attain the Subtle-Samparāya-Guṇasthāna. Therefore, except for humans, all other types of beings (Daṇḍakas) should be understood to have only the two aforementioned options (binding of seven or eight Karma-types), because they cannot attain the Subtle-Samparāya-Guṇasthāna, and therefore the third option (binding of six Karma-types) is not possible for them. / The statement about humans is the same as for ordinary beings. / That is, humans have all three types of binding. (3) From the perspective of multiplicity, all beings, along with the binding of Knowledge-Obscuration and Perception-Obscuration Karma, bind other Karma-types. In the absence of binding the Karma of Life-Span, all beings bind seven Karma-types, and in the presence of its binding, they bind eight Karma-types. In the context of multiplicity, those who bind seven or eight Karma-types are always found in large numbers, but those who bind six Karma-types are found only at specific times and not at other times, because their interval is said to be up to six months. When one who binds six Karma-types is not found, then the first option occurs. When one is found, then the second option occurs, and when many beings who bind six Karma-types are found, then the third option occurs.

## Twenty-fifth Chapter: The Twenty-fifth Karma Bandha Vedapada

This chapter discusses the nature of karma-prakriti (karma-nature) at the time of karma-bandha (karma-binding) for jivas (living beings) by the knowledge-obscuring karma (jnana-avaran karma) and other karmas.

**1766. [1]**  "How many karma-prakritis are there, Bhagavan?" 
**[1769-1 U]** "Gautama, there are eight karma-prakritis. They are: jnana-avaran karma (knowledge-obscuring karma) to antaray karma (hindering karma)." 
**[1766-2]** "Similarly, from nairyika (hell-being) to vaimanika (heaven-being)."

**1770. [1]** "Bhagavan, how many karma-prakritis does a jiva experience when binding jnana-avaran karma?"
**[1770-1 U]** "Gautama, he experiences eight karma-prakritis by rule."
**[1770-2]** "Similarly, from a nairyika to a vaimanika."

**1771.** "Similarly, for many (from many hell-beings to many heaven-beings)."

**1772.** "Similarly, for all the other six karmas except vedaniya karma (karma that produces experience)."

**1773. [1]** "Bhagavan, how many karma-prakritis does a jiva experience when binding vedaniya karma?"
**[1770-1 U]** "Gautama, he experiences either seven, or one, or four."

Page #1282:
---------------------------
## Twenty-fifth Karmabandhavedapaka [1773-1 pr.]

**Lord! How many Karma-prakritis does a being experience when it binds Vedaniya Karma?**

[1773-1 ut.] **Gautama! It experiences seven (Karma-prakritis), eight or four (Karma-prakritis).**

[2] **And in the case of humans, it should be said in the same way. From the remaining Nairyikas to the Vaimanikas, beings experience eight Karma-prakritis according to the rule, both with the desire for oneness and with the desire for multiplicity.**

[1773-2]

## [1774-1 pr.] Lord! How many Karma-prakritis do many beings experience when they bind Vedaniya Karma?

[1774-1 ut.] **Gautama!**

1. **All beings, when they bind Vedaniya Karma, are experiencers of eight or four Karma-prakritis.**
2. **Or, many beings are experiencers of eight or four Karma-prakritis, and some one being is an experiencer of seven Karma-prakritis.**
3. **Or, many beings are experiencers of eight, four or seven Karma-prakritis.**

[1774-2] **In the same way, it should be said about many humans at the time of binding Vedaniya Karma.**

**|| Pannavanaye Bhagavatiye Panchvasiyam Karmabandhavedapayam Samattam ||**

**Discussion:**

At the time of Karmabandha, there are five conclusions regarding the experience of Karma:

1. According to the statement mentioned in relation to the collective beings, Nairyikas, Asurakumara, etc. Bhavanapati, Prithvikaayika, etc. Ekaindriya, Vikalendriya, Tiryanchpanchendriya, Manushya, Vanavyantara, Jyotishka and Vaimanika also experience eight Karma-prakritis according to the rule, both with the desire for oneness and with the desire for multiplicity, while binding Jnanavaraniya Karma.
2. Similarly, it should be understood in relation to all other Karmas except Vedaniya (Darshanavaraniya, Nama, Gotra, Aayushya, Mohaniya and Antaraya).
3. Collective beings experience seven, eight or four Karma-prakritis while binding Vedaniya Karma, with respect to oneness and multiplicity. The reason for this is that beings with Upshantamoha and Kshinamaha experience seven Karma-prakritis, because they do not experience Mohaniya Karma. Beings from Mithyadrishti Gunasthan to Sukshmasampraya (tenth Gunasthan) experience all eight Karma-prakritis.

Page #1283:
---------------------------
[Kam] [Prajapana sutra] state that the Syogi Kevali experience only four non-destructive karma-prakritis, because their four destructive karmas do not arise. 4. From the perspective of oneness and multiplicity, like the Samuccaya Jiva, a human being also experiences seven, eight, or four karma-prakritis while binding the Vedaniya karma. 5. Except for humans, all other beings, such as Naraka, experience eight karma-prakritis according to the rule while binding the Vedaniya karma, from the perspective of oneness and multiplicity. || Prajnapana Bhagavati's twenty-fifth Karmabandhavedapad is complete || 1.

---------------------------
1775. [1] How many karma-prakritis (types of karmas) are there, O Lord? Gautama! Eight karma-prakritis are enumerated, namely, jnanavaraniiya (knowledge-obscuring) up to antaraaya (obstructive).

[1775-1 Q.] Bhagavan! How many karma-prakritis are propounded? [1775-1 A.] Gautama! Eight karma-prakritis are propounded, namely, jnanavaraniiya up to antaraaya.

[2] Similarly, for the nairayikas (hell-beings) up to the vaimaanikas (celestial beings).

[1775-2] In the same way, the karma-prakritis exist for the nairayikas up to the vaimaanikas.

1776. O Lord! When a jiva (living being) experiences the jnanavaraniiya karma, how many karma-prakritis does it bind? Gautama! It binds either seven-fold, eight-fold, six-fold, or one-fold.

[1776 Q.] Bhagavan! When a jiva experiences the jnanavaraniiya karma, how many karma-prakritis does it bind? [1776 A.] Gautama! It binds either seven-fold, eight-fold, six-fold, or one-fold.

1777. [1] O Lord! When a nairayika (hell-being) experiences the jnanavaraniiya karma, how many karma-prakritis does it bind? Gautama! It binds either seven-fold or eight-fold.

[1777-1 Q.] Bhagavan! When a nairayika experiences the jnanavaraniiya karma, how many karma-prakritis does it bind? [1777-1 A.] Gautama! It binds either seven-fold or eight-fold.

[2] Similarly, up to the vaimaanikas (celestial beings). However, for the human, it is as stated for the general jiva (in Sutra 1776).

[1777-2] In the same way, (from the asura-kumara up to the bhavana-pati) up to the vaimaanikas should be known. However, the statement for the human is similar to that of the general jiva (as mentioned in Sutra 1776).

1778. O Lord! When jivas (living beings) experience the jnanavaraniiya karma, how many karma-prakritis do they bind? Gautama! It may be: (1) seven-fold binding and eight-fold binding, or (2) seven-fold binding, eight-fold binding, and six-fold binding, or (3) seven-fold binding, one-fold binding, and six-fold binding, or (4) seven-fold binding, one-fold binding, and eight-fold binding.

##  **Translation:**

**Prijnapana Sutra Discussion - Vedaniya Karma**

**Binding of other Karmas during the moments of Vedana of Vedaniya Karma**

(1) A being and a human being are bound or managed by one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or eight natures. This means that a Sayogi Kevali, Upaśānta Moha, and Kṣīṇa Moha Gunasthāna-dwelling being binds only one Vedaniya nature while experiencing the Vedana of Vedaniya Karma, because even in a Sayogi Kevali, the rise and binding of Vedaniya Karma is found. A-Sayogi Kevali are managers. They experience the Vedana of Vedaniya Karma, but due to the influence of Yogas, there is no binding of it or any other Karma.

(2) Except for humans, from Naraka to Vaimānika - they bind 7 or 8 Karma natures while experiencing the Vedana of Vedaniya Karma.

(3) Many beings - three bhangas - all! B. B. B. A. B. B. B. B. = three bhangas 781 7 8 16 7 8 16. With the manager, in terms of oneness and multiplicity - two bhangas (in terms of oneness and multiplicity) or B. B. B. A. A. 7 8 1 6 Aban. - 4 bhangas = total 6 bhangas in terms of oneness and multiplicity of the aggregate beings.

(4) Ekaindriya beings - no choice / they are bound by many and many.

(5) Except for humans, from Naraka to Vaimānika - the same three bhangas as before.

(6) Humans - (in terms of oneness or multiplicity) = 27 bhangas (Jñānāvaraṇīya Karma - binding). In relation to Āyuṣya, Nāma, and Gotra Karma, it is like Vedaniya Karma. The pattern of binding of Karma natures during the experience of Āyuṣya, etc. Karma is 1785. And where there is Vedana, there is Āyuṣya, Nāma, and Gotra. [1785] Just as the binding of Karma natures is stated along with the experience of Vedaniya Karma, so it should be said in the case of Āyuṣya, Nāma, and Gotra Karma. [1786] Just as (in Sutra 1755-61) the binding of Jñānāvaraṇīya Karma nature is stated, so here the binding should be stated along with the experience of Mohaniya Karma.

**Conclusion of the discussion on Ved-Vedak:** The subject matter of this Pada is: When a being Vedana a particular Karma like Gnanavaranijjam, how many other Karma-Prakritis does it Vedana? / (I) A being who Vedana Gnanavaranijja Karma, or a human being, i.e., a human being with Upshantamoha or Kshina Moha, is not Vedak of Mohanijja Karma, and therefore Vedak of seven Karma-Prakritis. In addition, all beings or humans up to Sukhmasampray Vedana eight Karma-Prakritis. (II) There are three divisions with respect to many beings: (1) All beings are Vedak of eight Karma-Prakritis, (2) Alternatively, many are Vedak of eight and some are Vedak of seven, (3) Alternatively, many are Vedak of eight and many are Vedak of seven.

The twenty-eighth *Aaharapad* (Dietary Chapter) of the *Prajnapanasutra* discusses in detail the food and non-food of worldly beings and Siddhas through eleven and thirteen gates of two objectives. The soul is inherently non-eater, because the pure soul (Siddha-Buddha-Mukta Paramatma) does not have a body, karma, attachment, etc. Being nir-anjan (stainless) and nir-akar (formless), it never desires food. As is the nature of Siddhas, so is the nature of the soul from the perspective of *Nischyanaya Drishti* (certain vision). Therefore, a question arose in the minds of various philosophers, seekers, and thinkers: If the soul is non-eater, then why does it feel hungry? Why do humans, animals, birds, etc., eat for the satisfaction of hunger? If beings have to eat due to the body and karma of *kshudhavedaniya* (hunger-related), then these questions arise: Siddhas are non-eaters, but how do the twenty-four *dandakavarti* beings from hell to the celestial beings, whether sentient, non-sentient, or mixed, eat? Do they desire food? If they do, after how much time does the desire arise? Which being eats what? Do they eat from all *atma-pradeshas* (soul-regions) or from one region? Do they eat repeatedly in life or only once? How much do they eat, how much do they taste? Do they eat all the *pudgalas* (particles) they have taken? How do they transform the ingested *aahar-pudgalas* (food particles)? Do they eat the body of *ekendriyadi* (one-sense beings)? And among them, who is *lomaahari* (hair-eater), who is *prakshepaahari* (particle-eater), and who is *projj-graahari* (ejector-eater)? Who is *manobhakshi* (mind-eater)? These and other discussions related to food are discussed in the first objective of this chapter. * In addition, many questions related to food remain: Are one or many beings, or all twenty-four *dandakavarti* beings, eaters, or is there any being who is also a non-eater? If any being is a non-eater in any state, then for what reason? In the context of these two questions, the second objective discusses the eater-non-eater comprehensively through thirteen gates: *bhavya* (future), *sanjna* (consciousness), *leshya* (tendency), *drishti* (vision), *sanyam* (restraint), *kashaya* (passions), *jnana-prajnana* (knowledge-wisdom), *yoga* (practice), *upayoga* (application), *veda* (knowledge), *sharira* (body), *paryapti* (sufficiency). * Looking at the answers of the first objective, many mysterious and profound facts are revealed as solutions for the seeker. For example, the food of the *vaikriya* (transformed) body is non-sentient. 1. *Pannavanasuttam Bha. 1, p. 392*

Page #1295:
---------------------------
The **Prajñāpanā Sūtra** states that the diet of an **audārika** (possessing a physical body) is of three types: **saccitta** (conscious), **acitta** (unconscious), and **miśra** (mixed). The food consumed is of two types: **ābhōganirvṛtti** and **anābhōganirvṛtti**. **Ābhōganirvṛtti** is food consumed by choice, while **anābhōganirvṛtti** is food consumed involuntarily. There are different time limits for different beings when consuming food by choice. However, food consumed involuntarily is consumed continuously.

The text also clarifies the type of food consumed by different beings. Food is consumed with qualities of color, smell, taste, and touch, and there is great diversity in this. The food consumed by **nārakas** (hell beings) is characterized by bad color, etc., while the food consumed by **devas** (gods) is characterized by good color, etc. Some beings consume food from all six directions, while others consume food from three, four, or five directions.

The **pudgalas** (matter particles) consumed as food are transformed into the five senses and the limbs. The body is also shaped by the food consumed. An innumerable portion of the **pudgalas** consumed as food is transformed into food, and an infinite portion is enjoyed.

The final chapter also explains which of the twenty-four **daṇḍakavarti** (those who have attained the highest state of liberation) beings consume **lōmāhāra** (hair-eating) and **prakshepahāra** (food consumed in lumps), and which beings consume **prōjahāra** (food consumed through the mouth) and **manōbhaksana** (food consumed through the mind). It also explains which beings consume the bodies of other beings. This fact is presented here in a general form.

The **Sūtrakṛtāṅgasūtra** (Shruta 2, Adhyayana 3, Āhāraparijñā-Adhyayana) and the **Bhagavatosūtra** discuss in detail how different beings, such as those with an earth body, consume the unconscious bodies of plants, etc., and how beings like the fetus consume the mother's blood and the father's semen. The **Stānāṅgasūtra** (Chapter 4) describes four types of food for **tiryañcas** (animals), **manushyas** (humans), and **devas** (gods).

For example, the four types of food for **tiryañcas** are: (1) **kaṅkōpam** (food like bones), (2) **bilōpam** (food like worms), (3) **pāṇa** (elephant) **mānsōpam** (food like elephant flesh), and (4) **putra mānsōpam** (food like the flesh of one's own offspring).

The four types of food for **manushyas** are: **aśan** (cooked food), **pān** (drinks), **khādim** (food consumed for nourishment), and **svādim** (food consumed for taste).

The four types of food for **devas** are: **varṇavān** (colored), **rasavān** (tasty), **gandhavān** (fragrant), and **sparśavān** (touching).

The text also mentions the desire for food among **devas**, with the desire for food among **vaimānika devas** (celestial beings) lasting for a very long time, up to 33,000 years. This indicates that the desire for food after a long time is the result of some previous birth's **samyama** (self-control) practices or **puṇyakarya** (meritorious deeds).

Twenty-eighth Dietary Principle: Primary] [101 * A human being, if they desire, can remain without food for a long time through tapascharya, and anaharakata is the ultimate goal of Ratnatraya Sadhana / For this, one must become sanjata-sanjata and sanjata, and finally nosanjata-noasanjata-no-sanjatasanjata. This is clearly stated in its sanjatadwar. * Overall, the discussion on diet is enlightening, interesting, diet-science-based and self-realization-inspiring for sadhakas and shravakas. 1.

**Twenty-eighth Food-Chapter**

**First Objective:**

The eleven gates mentioned in the first objective are:

1. **Saccittaahara** (having consciousness of food)
2. **Aaharaarthi** (desire for food)
3. **Kevati** (for how long)
4. **Kimva Vi** (what kind of food)
5. **Savvano Chev** (from all directions)
6. **Katibhagam** (how much)
7. **Samve Khalu** (do they all eat)
8. **Parinaame Chaiv** (do they always transform)
9. **Egendriyasheeraadi** (one-sense-bodied etc.)
10. **Lomaahara** (hair-eating)
11. **Manobhakkhi** (mind-eating)

**Discussion:**

The first objective presents eleven gates related to food, explained in two Sangrahani-Gathaas.

The first gate explores whether beings from the Nairyaika to the Vaimanika realms are **Saccittaahara**, **Acittaahara**, or **Misraahara** (conscious eaters, unconscious eaters, or mixed eaters).

The second to eighth gates address:

* **Aaharaarthi** (whether beings like Naraka are desirous of food)
* **Kevati** (how long the desire for food lasts)
* **Kimva Vi** (what kind of food they eat)
* **Savvano Chev** (whether they eat from all directions)
* **Katibhagam** (how much food they consume)
* **Samve Khalu** (whether they eat all the ingested particles)
* **Parinaame Chaiv** (how they transform the ingested food)

The ninth to eleventh gates discuss:

* **Egendriyasheeraadi** (whether they eat the bodies of one-sense-bodied beings)
* **Lomaahara** (whether beings like Naraka are hair-eaters or **Prakshepaahara** (particle-eaters))
* **Manobhakkhi** (whether they are **Ojaahara** (life-force eaters) or **Manobhakkhi** (mind-eaters))

The first objective elaborates on these eleven gates.

[Twenty-eighth Dietary Section] In the twenty-four Dandas, the first illustrated dietary gate 1794. [1] "O Venerable One! Are the Nairyikas *saccittaharis*, *acittaharis*, or *misraharis*?" "Gautama!

Discussion - *Saccittaharis*, *acittaharis*, or *misraharis*? - All worldly beings are divided into two parts in relation to the body that sustains them in the cycle of births and deaths - (1) Vaikriyasariras and (2) Audarikashariras. / The Vaikriya-bodied beings, who are the hellish beings, gods, etc., consume the pudgalas that are suitable for nourishing the Vaikriya body, and those pudgalas are only *acitta*, not *saccitta* (possessed by a soul) or mixed. Therefore, in the present context, the Nairyikas, the Asurakumaras, etc., the Bhavanapatidevas, the Vanabyantardevas, the Jyotishkas, and the Vaimanika Devas (who are Vaikriyasariras) are described as exclusively *acittaharis*. And in addition to these, the one-sensed to five-sensed Tiryanchas and humans, who are Audarikashariras, consume the pudgalas that are suitable for nourishing the Audarikasharira, which are of all three types. Therefore, they are described as *saccittaharis*, *acittaharis*, and *misraharis*.  /  In the Nairyikas, the desire for food, etc., from the second to the eighth gate, 1765. "O Venerable One!

They are *aahararthis*."  /  1796. "O Venerable One! When does the desire for food arise in them?" "Gautama! There are two types of food desires in the Nairyikas, namely *abhoganivritti* and *anabhoganivritti*. / Now, those who have *anabhoganivritti* have the desire for food arise without any delay. / Now, those who have *abhoganivritti* have the desire for food arise after an immeasurable period of time, at the end of a *muhurta*." / 1.

[Twenty-eighth Food-Verse] [105 [1798-2 U.] Gautama! Do they also consume one-quality black pudgalas, or even consume infinite-quality black pudgalas? / In the same way (from blood-color to) one should know the aforementioned question and answer regarding white-color. 1766. And in the same way, regarding smell and taste, one should say "palāpaka" as before. 1800. [1] Those beings who consume pudgalas that are touch-based, they do not consume one-touch pudgalas, nor two or three touch pudgalas, but they consume four-touch pudgalas up to eight-touch pudgalas. In terms of the path of the vidhāna (distinction), they also consume rough pudgalas up to coarse pudgalas. / [2] Those who consume rough touch pudgalas, do they consume one-quality rough pudgalas, or even consume infinite-quality rough pudgalas? Gotama! Do they consume one-quality rough pudgalas, or even consume infinite-quality rough pudgalas? In the same way, having said eight touch pudgalas up to infinite-quality coarse pudgalas, they consume them. / [1800-2 Pr.] Bhagavan! Do they who consume rough touch pudgalas, consume one-quality rough pudgalas, or even consume infinite-quality rough pudgalas? [1800-2 U.] Gautama! They consume one-quality rough pudgalas, or even consume infinite-quality rough pudgalas. In the same way, in order, one should say "they consume infinite-quality coarse pudgalas" up to this point. / [3] Bhagavan! Do they who consume infinite-quality coarse pudgalas, consume touched pudgalas or untouched pudgalas? [1800-3 U.] Gautama! They consume touched pudgalas, not untouched pudgalas. / (As said in Su. 877-15-23) Just as it is said in the bhāṣā-uddeśaka, in the same way, they consume from all six directions according to the rule. 1801. Due to the cause of the proṣaṇṇa, the color, time, blue, smell, bad smell, taste, bitter-sour, touch, rough-heavy-soft-coarse, those pudgalas that are transformed, ripened, matured, and broken down by those qualities of color, smell, and touch, and those pudgalas that are produced, are very subtle, dense, and are consumed by the beings due to their accumulation.

[106] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra [1801] Due to the multitude of causes, those which are black-blue in color, foul-smelling, bitter and pungent in taste, and harsh, heavy, cold, and rough to the touch, they completely consume the pudgalas that have entered their body-field by transforming, tormenting, destroying, and generating other new color, smell, taste, and touch qualities. / 1802. "O Venerable One! Do the Niryayikas consume everything? Do they completely transform everything? Do they breathe in and out everything? Do they consume everything repeatedly?

The twenty-eighth food item [107] Gotama! They (the hell beings) repeatedly transform those pudgals into the form of the auditory sense organ, or into the form of the tactile sense organ, or into the form of the undesirable, or into the form of the non-complete, or into the form of the unpleasant, or into the form of the inauspicious, or into the form of the uncognizable, or into the form of the unmindful, or into the form of the uncertain (or into the form of the unwanted), or into the form of the unaspired, or into the form of the heavy, or into the form of the light, or into the form of the painful, or into the form of the non-pleasant. [1805] Bhagavan! What form do they repeatedly transform those pudgals into, when they take them as food? [1805] Gotama! They repeatedly transform those pudgals into the form of the auditory sense organ, or into the form of the tactile sense organ, or into the form of the undesirable, or into the form of the non-complete, or into the form of the unpleasant, or into the form of the inauspicious, or into the form of the uncognizable, or into the form of the unmindful, or into the form of the uncertain (or into the form of the unwanted), or into the form of the unaspired, or into the form of the heavy, or into the form of the light, or into the form of the painful, or into the form of the non-pleasant. / Discussion The nature of the two types of food for hell beings - The food of hell beings is of two types - *ābhōganirvatit* and *anābhōganirvatit*. / The meaning of *ābhōganirvatit* is food that is taken willingly and used. The meaning of *anābhōganirvatit* is food that is taken without desire and without use. *Anābhōganirvatit* food continues constantly throughout the entire existence. This food is in the form of *prōjasāhār* etc. The desire for *ābhōganirvatit* food arises in the mind in an immeasurable number of moments. The desire to eat arises within a single moment. / This is why the desire for food of hell beings is said to be within a moment. This is the third gate. What do hell beings eat? - They eat the pudgals that are infinite in extent, because the pudgals that are finite in extent or immeasurable in extent cannot be taken by the *skandha* of the living being, it is not possible for them to be taken. In terms of extent, they eat the *skandhas* that are immeasurable in extent. In terms of time, they take the *skandhas* that are in any state - inferior, medium, or superior. In terms of feeling, they take the substances that have color, smell, taste, and touch as food, because every atom has one smell, one taste, and two touches. After that, the options of taking food with one or more colors, smells, tastes, and touches have been explained. After that, it has also been explained that they (hell beings) eat the substances (connected pudgals) that are touched by the *ātmaprēdēshas* and they eat regularly from all six directions. / 2 The characteristics of the food of hell beings from two different perspectives - Hell beings generally eat food that is black and blue in color, bitter and astringent in taste, foul-smelling, and rough, heavy, cold, and dry to the touch. Here, the word *prōsanna* is used to indicate abundance. This means that it is generally the *mithyāvṛṣṭi* hell beings who have inauspicious experiences who eat the food that is black in color etc. But the hell beings who are going to be *tīrthankaras* etc. in the future do not eat such food. 1, 2. *Prajñāpanā* (Haribhadrīya Tīkā) Bhā. 5, pp. 549-552

## 108] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra] How do Narakas (hell beings) consume food?

They consume food by transforming the old color, smell, taste, and touch qualities of the pudgalas (matter particles) they ingest, through torment, grinding, and destruction. They completely change these qualities and generate new color, smell, taste, and touch qualities. They then absorb these transformed pudgalas into their body-field from all their atma-pradeshas (regions of the soul).

**The meaning of "sarvatah paharadi" (consuming from all regions):**

* **Sarvatah pahara:** Consuming from all atma-pradeshas.
* **Sarva-atma-pradeshas se aahar parinamaate:** They transform food from all atma-pradeshas.
* **Sarvatah uchchvas-nishvas lete hain:** They breathe in and out from all regions.
* **Sada pahara karte hain:** They always consume.
* **Sada parinat karte hain:** They always transform.
* **Sada uchchvas-nishvas lete hain:** They always breathe in and out.
* **Kadaachit aahar aur parinaman karte hain tatha uchchvas-nishvas lete hain:** Sometimes they consume, transform, and breathe.

**How much do they consume and savor?**

* They consume an infinitesimal fraction of the pudgalas they ingest as food. They are unable to consume the rest.
* They savor an infinite fraction of the pudgalas they consume. Even though they don't savor the rest, those pudgalas still transform into their bodies.

**(Sixth Gate)**

* **All pudgalas consumed as food, or a part of them:** They consume all the pudgalas that are suitable for consumption, leaving behind the rest and transforming them into their bodies. They don't consume just a part of them, because they only consume pudgalas that are suitable for consumption, leaving behind the rest and transforming them into their bodies.

**What form do the consumed pudgalas transform into?**

* The pudgalas consumed by Narakas as food transform again and again into the five senses: hearing, sight, smell, taste, and touch.
* However, these pudgalas, even though they transform into senses, are not auspicious but inauspicious. They transform into undesirable forms.
* Just as flies find camphor and sandalwood, even though they are auspicious, to be undesirable, similarly, these pudgalas, even though they are auspicious, appear undesirable to some beings.
* They transform into forms that are:
    * **Akant (Akamaneya):** Not beautiful to look at.
    * **Apriya:** Not pleasing to the mind, even when seen.
    * **Ashubha:** Having inauspicious color, smell, taste, and touch.
    * **Amanognya:** Not generating joy in the mind because they are painful during their ripening.
    * **Amanama:** Not acceptable to beings as food.
    * **Anipsita:** Not enjoyable to savor.
    * **Abhidhyata:** Not generating desire for them.
* They transform into heavy forms, not light forms.

**(Eighth Gate)**

* **Seven Gates (2-8) related to Bhavanapatis (lords of the realms):** 1806, [1]

**(Asurkumara (son of an Asura) asks the monk):**

* **Asurkumara:** "Bhanta! What is food?"
* **Monk:** "Food is..."
* **Asurkumara:** "And just as it is for humans, so it is for Asura Kumaras, as long as they enjoy, eat, and transform."
* **Monk:** "In that case, the consumption of food by those who have the power of enjoyment is described in the fourth chapter of the scriptures."

[Twenty-eighth Dietary Section] [109 The food of the Satirēgas, who live for thousands of years, arises from the following: / The cause of their satisfaction is as follows: their color is yellow and white, their smell is fragrant, their taste is sour and sweet, their touch is soft, light, smooth, and warm (they eat these pudgals). / They destroy the old color, smell, taste, and touch qualities of (the pudgals that are eaten), that is, they completely transform them, and produce new color, smell, taste, and touch qualities (they eat the pudgals that are embedded in their body-field from all directions). / The pudgals that are taken as food are transformed into the five senses, such as the sense of hearing, and into the forms of desire, beauty, love, good fortune, pleasing, and agreeable. / They are not transformed into the form of heaviness, but into the form of solidity, and not into the form of suffering. / (Thus, the pudgals that are eaten by the Asurakumāras) are transformed again and again for them. The rest of the statement should be understood as being the same as the statement about the Narakas. [2] And so on, up to the Thanikumaras. / The food of the Navaras, who are liberated from the cycle of birth and death, arises from the following: [1806-2] In the same way, the statement about the Thanikumaras should be understood as being the same as the statement about the Asurakumāras. / The special thing is that their food arises from the excellent day-separation. / Explanation: The Asurakumāras, etc., have a desire for food, and the Asurakumāras have a desire for food every other day. This statement should be understood in relation to the Asurakumāras who live for ten thousand years. The excellent desire is in relation to the Balindra, who is in the state of the Satirēka Sagara, which is a little more than a thousand years. The rest of the statement about the Bhavanapatis should be understood in relation to those who live for an innumerable part of a Palyopama and more. / The Asurakumāras are only in the Prasanādī. / Therefore, they can eat pudgals from all six directions.

Twenty-eighth Dietary Section [111 [1810 Pr.] Bhagavan! Of the pudgalas that earth-bodied beings take as food, what proportion do they consume and what proportion do they savor in the future? [1810 U.] Gautama! They consume an innumerable proportion (of the pudgalas taken as food) and savor an infinite proportion. / 1811.  Bhanta! Of the pudgalas that earth-bodied beings take as food, do they consume all of them or not all of them? (i.e., do they consume a part of all of them?) [1811 Pr.] Bhagavan! Just as (in Sutra 1804) the statement of the Nairyakas has been said, so should it be said about earth-bodied beings. 1812. Bhanta! Of the pudgalas that earth-bodied beings take as food, in what form do those pudgalas repeatedly transform (in earth-bodied beings)? [1812 U.] Gautama! (Those pudgalas) repeatedly transform in the form of the uneven amount of the touch sense (i.e., in the form of both pleasant and unpleasant). / 1813.  And so on, from the Apkayikas to the Vanaspatikayikas. [1813]  Discussion—Earth-bodied beings, etc., who have one sense, constantly take food. / They take food in all six directions, unlike the Niryaghatas, and perhaps in three, four, or five directions, unlike the Vyaghatas. In them, there is no predominance of either a solitary auspicious or inauspicious influence. / The pudgalas taken as food by earth-bodied beings transform in them in the form of an uneven amount of the touch sense. This means that they do not transform in a solitary inauspicious form like the Narakas, nor in a solitary auspicious form like the Devas, but repeatedly transform sometimes in a pleasant and sometimes in an unpleasant form.

Their statement (as mentioned in [Sūtra] 1766) should be understood as being the same as that of the [Nārakas]. The special point is that the desire for food, which is [Ābhoganirvatita Pāhara] in them, arises from the [Vimātrā] in the [Antarmuhurta] of an [Asankhyeya] time.

[Twenty-eighth Food Chapter] [113]  A countless number of parts of the food taken by the two-sensed beings, even though they are not smelled, not touched, and not tasted, go to destruction. [1817]  O Bhagavan! Do the two-sensed beings consume all the Jain pudgalas as food, or do they not consume all of them? (That is, do they consume only a part of them?) [1817]  Gautama! The food of the two-sensed beings is said to be of two types, namely, Lomahar and Prakshepahar. They consume all the Jain pudgalas that they take as Lomahar, and they consume only a countless part of the Jain pudgalas that they take as Prakshepahar. Many thousands of their parts go to destruction in this way, and they are neither touched internally or externally, nor are they tasted. [1818]  O Bhagavan! Of these aforementioned Prakshepahar pudgalas, which are the ones that are not tasted and not touched, which are less, more, equal, or special? [1818]  Gautama! The pudgalas that are not tasted are the least, and the pudgalas that are not touched are countless times more than them. [1819]  O Bhagavan! In what forms do the Jain pudgalas that the two-sensed beings consume as food, repeatedly transform? [1819]  Gautama! Those pudgalas repeatedly transform into the forms of the tongue sense and the touch sense. [1820]  And so on, up to the four-sensed beings. It is noteworthy that many thousands of parts of the pudgalas taken as Prakshepahar by these (three-sensed, four-sensed) beings go to destruction without being smelled, touched, or tasted.

The rest of the statement for the Caturi-Indriya should be understood as the same as the statement for the Tri-Indriya. Explanation regarding the food of the Vikalendriya: Loma-āhāra - Food taken by the hairs or the hair follicles is called Loma-āhāra. Prakṣepa-āhāra - i.e., Kavala-āhāra, food taken by the mouth by putting it in (Prakṣipta) or in the form of a mouthful (Grāsa) is called Prakṣepa-āhāra / In the season of rain etc., the Pudgalas enter the body in the form of Proga, which is inferred from urine etc., is Loma-āhāra. The Dvi-Indriya etc. Vikalendriya Jīvas consume all the Pudgalas they take as Loma-āhāra, because their nature is like that. And they are able to consume only an innumerable part of the Pudgalas they take as Prakṣepa-āhāra. Many thousands of them are destroyed without being touched or tasted, because some Pudgalas are not consumed due to being too large and some due to being too small. The least number of Āharya Pudgalas are Anāsvādyamāna, the meaning is that in one part that is touchable, an infinite part is capable of being tasted, and an infinite part of that is capable of being smelled (Sūdhane ke).

Samushpajjati / [1824] The statement of the Panchendriya Tiryanchas should be known as being similar to the Triendriya Jivas.

Vaanavyantara, like Nagakumara (Su. 1806 [2]) / [1827] The statement regarding the Ahaar of Vaanavyantara Devas should be known as being similar to the Nagakumara. / 1828. And Jyotishkas / Now, the Prabhoganivattiye Ahaar arises in them from the Jghannya Divasa-Puhutta, and from the Ukkosa, also from the Divasa-Puhutta. / [1828] The statement of the Jyotishka Devas is also of the same type. But the desire for the Prabhoganivattiye Ahaar arises in them from the Jghannya Divasa-Pruthaktva, and from the Ukkosa, also from the Divasa-Pruthaktva. Vivechan - The special characteristic of the Ahaar of the Tiryanchas, Panchendriya, etc., is that the desire for the Prabhoganivattiye Ahaar arises in them from the Jghannya Antomuhurta, and from the Ukkosa, the Chatthabhatta (after two days).

[116] The desire for food after the exhaustion of the enjoyment of the object of enjoyment arises from the lowest [interval] of a moment and from the highest [interval] of the eighth part of a day (after three days). This statement should also be understood in relation to the humans of the Devakuru and Uttar Kuru regions. The food-object consumed by both of them, also, in the form of the measure of the five senses, again and again, is the other statement of the Vaṇavyantara and Jyotiṣka Devas, like the Nāgakumāra, but the desire for food after the exhaustion of the enjoyment of the object of enjoyment arises from the lowest and highest [interval] of two days to nine days. The lifespan of both these types of Devas is one-eighth of the lifespan of the Patyopamas, so naturally, they feel the desire for food after the lapse of the [interval] of days.

In the Vaimānika Devas, the description of the seven doors, etc. (2-8) 1826. And in the case of the sick, the desire for food after the exhaustion of the enjoyment of the object of enjoyment arises in the lowest [interval] of a day, and in the highest [interval] of thirty-three thousand years. The rest, like the Asurakumāras (Su. 1806 [1]), until they are consumed, is the same. [1826] Similarly, the statement regarding food in the Vaimānika Devas should be known. The special feature is that the desire for food after the exhaustion of the enjoyment of the object of enjoyment arises in the lowest [interval] of a day and in the highest [interval] of thirty-three thousand years. The rest of the statement (as mentioned in Su. 1806-1), until 'their those pudgalas undergo repeated transformation', should be said. 1830. In the Saudharmakalpa, the desire for food after the exhaustion of the enjoyment of the object of enjoyment arises in the lowest [interval] of a day and in the highest [interval] of two thousand years. 1831.

## The 123rd Dietary Item [123 Which living beings consume the bodies of which beings? - In this section, the consumption of bodies by the twenty-four Dandakavarti beings, starting with the Nairyika, is described from two perspectives: the perspective of पूर्वभावप्रज्ञापना (i.e., describing past existences) and the perspective of प्रत्युत्पन्न-वर्तमानकालिक भाव (i.e., describing the present existence). / The intention of the solution to the question - The question is clear from the original text, but the solution states that Naraka beings, from the perspective of पूर्वभावप्रज्ञापना, consume bodies from one-sense to five-sense beings, and from the perspective of वर्तमानभावप्रज्ञापना, Nairyika beings and others consume five-sense bodies, four-sense beings consume four-sense bodies, three-sense beings consume three-sense bodies, two-sense beings consume two-sense bodies, and one-sense beings like the Earth-bodied consume only one-sense bodies. In other words, a being consumes bodies with the same number of senses as itself. / The commentator explains the intention of this solution by saying that if we consider the past existence (Paryaya) of the consumed Pudgalas, we find that some of them were once one-sense beings, some were two-sense beings, some were three-sense beings, some were four-sense beings, and some were five-sense beings. If we apply this past existence to the present, then Naraka beings consume one-sense, two-sense, three-sense, four-sense, and five-sense bodies. But when we consider the present existence from the perspective of the ऋजुसूत्रनय, the ऋजुसूत्रनय accepts the क्रियमाण as कृत, the पाहार्यमाण as आहृत, and the परिणम्यमान Pudgalas as परिणत, which are becoming the form of the self-body. / Thus, according to the ऋजुसूत्रनय, only the self-body is consumed. The self-body of Narakas, Devas, humans, and five-sense Tiryanchas is five-sense. Similarly, for the remaining beings (one-sense to four-sense), we should say according to the situation. / Tenth: Lomahaara-Dwar 1856. "Raya nam bhanta! Ki lomahaara pakkhavahara?" "Goyama! Lomahaara, no pakkhavahara." [1856 Pr.] "O Bhagavan! Are Naraka beings Lomahaara or Pakkhavahara?" [1856 Ut.] "Gautama! They are Lomahaara, not Pakkhavahara." 1860. "Evam egidiya sabve deva ya bhaniamva jay vemanaya." [1860] Similarly, this should be said for one-sense beings, all Devas, and up to the Vaimanikas. 1.

[124] [From the two-sensed beings to humans, there are both Lomaharis and Prakshepaharis. [1861] Discussion - In the twenty-four categories of beings, Lomaharis and Prakshepaharis are those who receive blows through their hairs (hairs) and Prakshepaharis are those who take a mouthful of food (kour) in their hands and put it in their mouths. / In the twenty-four categories of beings, Narakas, Bhavanapatis, Vanavyantara, Jyotishka, Vaimanika and Ekaindriya beings are Lomaharis, not Prakshepaharis; because Narakas and the four types of Devas have Vaikriya bodies, therefore they are naturally Lomaharis. They lack Kavlahar / The five types of Ekaindriya beings, such as Prithvikaayika, do not have mouths, therefore they lack Prakshepahar. But the two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, five-sensed Tiryanch and humans are both Lomaharis and Katralaharis (Prakshepaharis). The Lomahar of Narakas should also be known only to Narakas, not to the insufficient. ' Eleventh: Manobhakshidwar 1862. Neraiya nam bhanta! Kim proyaahara manabhakkhi? Goyamar!

Among the Devas, those who are Manobhakshis, they have an Ichchaman (i.e., the desire to eat in the mind) / For example, they want to eat Mano (the object of thought in the mind)! After that, when those Devas have this desire in their minds, then quickly those Pudgalas who are desired, beautiful, up to the mind, become their Manobhakshya, 1. Prajnaapana.

O Gautama! In the same way, when those gods eat mentally, their mind, which is based on desire, is quickly satisfied and satiated. Discussion-Proja-Mahari means-the group of pudgalas that are fit for food in the region of origin is called 'Proja'. Those who eat mentally due to desire arising in the mind are called Manobhakhi. Conclusion-All the generous-bodied beings are all Proja-Ahari and Naraka Proja-Ahari, and among the Vaikriya-bodied beings, the gods of all four castes are also Manobhakhi, and also Proja-Ahari. The nature of Manobhakhi gods is such that they, with a special kind of power, desire in their mind the food-worthy pudgalas that are nourishing, pleasant, favorable and palatable for the body, and accordingly they obtain food, and after obtaining it, they experience supreme satisfaction and delight / Narakas do not get such food, because due to the rise of unfavorable inauspicious karmas, they do not have such power.

## The Collection of Verses 1865: The Thirteen Gates of the Second Objective

**Verse 1865:** The Second Objective has thirteen gates: (1) the Food Gate, (2) the Bhavy Gate, (3) the Sanji Gate, (4) the Leshya Gate, (5) the Drishti Gate, (6) the Samyat Gate, (7) the Kashaya Gate, (8) the Gnan Gate, (9-10) the Yog Gate, the Upayog Gate, (11) the Ved Gate, (12) the Sarira Gate, and (13) the Paryapti Gate.

**Discussion:** The Second Objective will be shaped based on these thirteen gates. Here, the use of words like "Bhavy" etc. also implies their opposites, "Abhavy" etc.

**First: The Food Gate**

**Verse 1866:**  "O Bhagavan! Is a Jiva a consumer or a non-consumer?" "Gautama! He is a consumer in some ways and a non-consumer in some ways."

**Verse 1866-2:**  "One should know this in the same way from the Nairyik (hell) to the Vaimanik (heavenly beings)."

**Verse 1867:** "O Bhagavan! Is a Siddha (liberated soul) a consumer or a non-consumer?" "Gautama! A Siddha is not a consumer, he is a non-consumer."

**Verse 1868:** "O Bhagavan! Are (many) Jivas consumers or non-consumers?" "Gautama! They are both consumers and non-consumers."

Twenty-eighth Food Chapter [127 1869. [1] Gautama asked. Gotama! Are all beings food-eaters? Or are some food-eaters and some non-food-eaters? Or are some food-eaters and some non-food-eaters? [1869-1 Pr.] Bhagavan! (Many) hell beings are food-eaters or non-food-eaters? [1866-1 Ut.] Gautama! (1) They are all food-eaters, (2) or many are food-eaters and one is non-food-eater, (3) or many are food-eaters and many are non-food-eaters / [2] And so on up to the Vaimānika /  One-sensed beings should be understood as being like many beings / [1870] In the same way, know up to the Vaimānika /  The special point is that the statement about one-sensed beings should be understood as being like the statement about many beings /  1870. Siddha asked. Gotama! Are Siddhas food-eaters or non-food-eaters? [1870 Pr.] (Many) Siddhas are not food-eaters, they are non-food-eaters / [First Gate] How can a being be a food-eater or a non-food-eater? In terms of the state of disintegration, the state of the Kevali, the state of the Śaileśī, and the state of the Siddha, the aggregate being should be understood as a non-food-eater, and in terms of other states besides these, it should be understood as a food-eater. It is also said, 'Biggahagaimavanna Kevalino Samohya Ajogee Ya / Siddha Ya Pranahara Sesha Pahara Ga Jiwa //' Like the aggregate being, the hell being is also sometimes a food-eater and sometimes a non-food-eater /  From the Asura-kumāra up to the Vaimānika deva, all beings are sometimes food-eaters and sometimes non-food-eaters. In terms of the many, some beings are food-eaters and some are non-food-eaters /  All hell beings are food-eaters, or many hell beings are food-eaters and one is a non-food-eater, or many are food-eaters and many are non-food-eaters /  This statement should be made up to the Vaimānika /  The statement about one-sensed beings should be understood as being like the statement about aggregate beings. That is, they are many non-food-eaters and many food-eaters. Siddhas are always non-food-eaters, in terms of both the singular and the plural. In terms of the state of disintegration, beings are non-food-eaters - the state of disintegration is different from the time when all beings are food-eaters, and the state of disintegration occurs somewhere, sometime, for some being. Although the state of disintegration is found in all times 1. (a) Prajñāpanā. Malayavṛtti, Abh. Ra' Ko. Bha. 2, p. 510 (b) Prajñāpanā. Prameyabodhinī Ṭīkā Bha. 5, pp. 628-630 2. Bahi, Bha. 5, p. 628

[128] The Prajñapana Sutra states that there are both āhāraka (consuming) and anāhāraka (non-consuming) jīvas (living beings), but this applies only to the bound jīvas. Therefore, there are many āhāraka jīvas. Siddhas (liberated souls) are always anāhāraka, they are always present, and they are infinitely superior to the abhyavyajīvas (unliberated beings). Also, at every moment, an innumerable portion of each nigoda (group of jīvas) attains the state of vihgraha-gati (destruction of the body). In this regard, the number of anāhāraka jīvas is also said to be very large.

Why and how are there three types of bhangas (divisions) among many nārka (hellish) jīvas? (1) The first bhang is that all nārka jīvas are sometimes āhāraka, and not a single nārka jīva is anāhāraka. Although there is a period of cessation of the birth of nārka jīvas, which lasts only for twelve muhūrta (a period of 48 minutes), during that time, the previously born nārka jīvas who have attained vihgraha-gati become āhāraka, and no new nārka jīvas are born. Therefore, no nārka jīva is anāhāraka at that time. (2) The second bhang is that many nārka jīvas are āhāraka, and one nārka jīva is anāhāraka. The reason for this is that perhaps one jīva is born in hell, perhaps two, three, four, or a countable or innumerable number are born. Therefore, when one jīva is born and attains vihgraha-gati, and all the other previously born nārka jīvas have become āhāraka, this should be understood as the second bhang. (3) The third bhang is that many nārka jīvas are āhāraka, and many are anāhāraka. This bhang occurs when many nārka jīvas are being born and they attain vihgraha-gati. Apart from these three, no other bhang is possible among nārka jīvas.

There is only one bhang among the ekendriya (one-sensed) jīvas: why and how? From pṛthvīkāyika (earth-bodied) to vanaspathikāyika (plant-bodied) jīvas, only one bhang is found. The reason for this is that in the four sthāvara (stationary) jīvas, from pṛthvīkāyika to vāyukāyika (air-bodied), an innumerable number of jīvas are born at every moment, therefore there are many āhāraka jīvas. And in vanaspathikāyika jīvas, an infinite number of jīvas are born at every moment from vihgraha-gati. Therefore, there are always many anāhāraka jīvas among them. Hence, only one bhang is found in all ekendriya jīvas: many āhāraka and many anāhāraka.

Second: Bhavyadvara 1871. [1] "Bhavantaḥ siddhiḥ, bhagavan! Jīvaḥ ki āhārakaḥ anāhārakaḥ?" "Gautama! Saḥ kacid āhārakaḥ, kacid anāhārakaḥ." [1871-1] "O Bhagavan! Is the bhavyasiddhi jīva āhāraka or anāhāraka?" "Gautama! He is sometimes āhāraka, sometimes anāhāraka." [1871-1] [2] "Evaṁ jāva vemāṇikaḥ." [1871-2] This same statement should be understood up to the vemāṇika (celestial) jīvas.

## 130] [Prajñāpanasūtra: Prabhavasiiddhika and Bhavasiddhika: Lakshana and Prāhārakata-Anāhārakata-Abhavasiiddhika are those who are not fit for liberation. Bhavasiddhika are those beings who will attain Siddhi after a finite, infinite or countless number of births. Similar to Bhavasiddhika, the concept of Prāhārakata-Anāhārakata has been explained for Prabhavasiiddhika. No-Bhavasiddhika, No-Prabhavasiiddhika and Siddha are the only beings who are No-Bhavasiddhika, No-Abhavasiiddhika. Since Siddhas have attained liberation, they cannot be called Bhavya and since they have attained liberation, they cannot be called Abhavasiiddhika (Abhavya) who are unfit for liberation. From the perspective of unity and plurality, they are Anāhārak.

[1882-2] **Maṇūsesu tiyabhangō.** [1882-2] (From the perspective of multiplicity, non-sentient and non-cognizant) there are three divisions (found) in humans. [1882-3] **Siddhā aṇāhārāga.** [Third Gate] **Daram 3** // [1882-3] (Many) liberated souls are non-consuming. [Third Gate] **Discussion:** Sentient-Non-sentient: Those who are endowed with mind are called sentient / Non-sentient is mindless / The question arises: Even in the state of disintegration, the sentient soul does not have a mind, in such a situation, how can it be non-consuming? The solution is that even after attaining the state of disintegration, the soul that is experiencing the lifespan of a sentient being is still called sentient at that time, even in the absence of mind, just as a hell-bound being who has attained the state of disintegration after experiencing the lifespan of a hell-being is still called a hell-being. One-sensed and multi-sensed beings are not sentient due to being mindless, therefore, one should not ask questions about one-sensed and multi-sensed beings in the context of sentience. There is no non-sentience in celestial beings and aerial beings - there is no practice of non-sentience in celestial beings and aerial beings, therefore, one should not call them non-sentient. Non-sentient and non-cognizant souls are consuming and non-consuming - such a soul is perhaps consuming and perhaps non-consuming from the perspective of oneness, because in the absence of the state of Kevali-samudghāta, it is consuming, in the remaining state, it is non-consuming / From the perspective of multiplicity, there are two divisions found in them. For example - (1) There are many non-sentient and non-cognizant souls who are consuming, because there are many Kevalis who are devoid of the state of samudghāta / Liberated souls are non-consuming, therefore, there are many who are non-consuming / There are three divisions found in non-sentient and non-cognizant humans (1) When no Kevali is in the state of samudghāta, then all are consuming, this is the first division, (2) When many humans are in the state of samudghāta and one Kevali is in the state of samudghāta, then this is the second division, (3) When many Kevalis have attained the state of samudghāta, then this is the third division / / **Fourth:** **Leshyādvār** 1883.

"In the case of the Kapotaleśya Nārakas and others, it should be said that there are three bhangas (except for the Samuccaya Jivas and the Ekendriya Jivas) in each, similar to the Samuccaya Jivas. In the case of the Tejo-leśya Jivas, one should understand that there is only one bhang in each of the Ekendriya Jivas, such as the Pṛthvīkāyika, etc., who possess Tejo-leśya, in relation to Āhārakata, Anāhārakata, and Ekatva (as before). In relation to Bahutva, six bhangas are found in the Pṛthvīkāyika, Apkāyika, and Vanaspatikāyika Tejo-leśya Jivas: (1) All Āhārakas, (2) All Anāhārakas, (3) One Āhārak, one Anāhārak, (4) One Āhārak, many Anāhārakas, (5) Many Āhārakas, one Anāhārak, and (6) Many Āhārakas, many Anāhārakas. In addition, in each of the Jivas from the Samuccaya Jivas to the Vaimānika, in whom Tejo-leśya is found, there should be said to be three bhangas as before, but not in the rest. That is, in the Nārakas, Tejas-kāyikas, Vāyu-kāyikas, Dwīndriyas, Trīndriyas, and Chaturindriyas, there should be no statement about Tejo-leśya, because they do not have Tejo-leśya. The Tejo-leśya in the Pṛthvīkāyika, Apkāyika, and Vanaspatikāyika is such that the Vaimānika Devas of the Bhavanapati, Vāṇavyantara, Jyotiṣka, and Saudharmādi Devalokas have Tejo-leśya, and they can be born in the three Pṛthvīkāyika, etc., after undergoing a change. From this point of view, Tejo-leśya is possible in the Pṛthvīkāyika, etc., śrayas. In relation to the Jivas who have Padma-śukla-leśya, the Āhārak-Anāhārak-vicāraṇā-Pañcendriya-tiryanch, Manusyas, Vaimānika-devas, and Samuccaya Jivas have both Padma-śukla-leśya. Therefore, in relation to Ekatva, there is only one bhang as before, and in relation to Bahutva, there are three bhangas as before. In the case of the Leśya-rahit Jivas, the Anāhārakata-Samuccaya Jivas, Manusyas, Ayogika-kevalis, and Siddhas are Leśya-rahit. Therefore, they are Anāhārakas in relation to Ekatva and Bahutva, not Āhārakas. 3. Pañcama: Dṛṣṭidvāra 1887. [1] Samma hiṭṭhī ṇam bhanta! Jīve ki pāhārae aṇahārae? Goyamā!

Sanjaya-Sanjaya, who are the five-sense-transmigratory beings and humans, are both individually and collectively *paharak* (consumers), not *anahaarak* (non-consumers). [1862] Restrained-restrained beings, five-sense-transmigratory beings, and humans, are both individually and collectively *paharak*, not *anahaarak*. / 1863. Gosanjay-noprasanjay-nosanjayasanjay, who are the Siddhas, are both individually and collectively *anahaarak*, not *paharak*. Door 6 // [1863] Non-restrained, non-unrestrained, non-restrained-restrained beings and Siddhas, are both individually and collectively *anahaarak*, not *paharak*. / [Sixth Door] Discussion - Restrained, restrained-restrained, unrestrained, and non-restrained-non-unrestrained-non-restrained-restrained. The definition is that one who accepts restraint (five great vows, etc.) i.e. is *virat* (abstaining), is called restrained. One who accepts *anuvatti* (following) and *shravakatva* (being a follower), i.e. is *deshavirat* (abstaining from the world), is called restrained-restrained. One who is not *virat*, neither accepts *sadhutva* (being a monk) nor *shravakatva*, is called unrestrained. And one who is neither restrained, nor restrained-restrained, nor unrestrained, is called non-restrained-non-unrestrained-non-restrained-restrained. Restrained beings can only be a collection of beings and humans, restrained-restrained beings can be a collection of beings, humans, and five-sense-transmigratory beings. Non-restrained-non-unrestrained-non-restrained-restrained beings are *ayogikevalo* (non-liberated) and Siddhas. Restrained beings and humans are *anahaarak* in terms of individual *kevalisamudghata* (liberation) and *ayogitva* (non-liberation), and *paharak* at other times. In terms of collective, there are three possibilities: (1) All restrained beings are *paharak*; this possibility occurs when none are in *kevalisamudghata* or *ayogi* state. (2) Many restrained beings are *paharak* and one is *anahaarak*; this possibility occurs when one is in *kevalisamudghata* or *shaleshi* (non-liberated) state. (3) Many restrained beings are *paharak* and many are *anahaarak*; this possibility occurs when many restrained beings are in *kevalisamudghata* or *shaleshi* state. / In unrestrained beings, in terms of individual, there is only one possibility: one *paharak*, one *anahaarak*. / In terms of collective, there is only one possibility: in the collection of beings and unrestrained earth-bodied beings, etc., there are many *paharak* and many *anahaarak*. In unrestrained beings from hell to *vaimanika* (excluding the collection of beings and one-sense beings), there are three possibilities as before. Restrained-restrained beings, who are *deshavirat* (abstaining from the world), beings, humans, and five-sense-transmigratory beings, are all *paharak* both individually and collectively, not *anahaarak*; because *deshavirati-parinam* (result of abstaining from the world) does not occur in any being except humans and five-sense-transmigratory beings, and restrained-restrained beings are always *paharak*, because *deshavirati-parinam* does not occur in *antaralagati* (intermediate state) and *kevalisamudghata* (liberation) states. / Non-restrained-non-unrestrained-non-restrained-restrained beings and Siddhas are *anahaarak* both individually and collectively, not *paharak*; because they are *shaleshi* (non-liberated), free from the three *yogas* (karmas), and *ashariri* (bodyless), they are not *paharak*. 1.

##  The Seventh Gate of the Prajñapana Sutra: The Door of Kṣaya (1864)

[1] "Venerable one, what is the nature of the *sakṣaya* being, is it *āhāraka* (consuming) or *anāhāraka* (non-consuming)?" [1894-1] "Gautama, it is sometimes *āhāraka* and sometimes *anāhāraka*." [1894-1] [2] "This is how it should be understood from the *nārakas* (hell beings) up to the *vaimānika* (celestial beings)." [1894-2]

## (1565)

[1] "In terms of multiplicity, excluding the *jīva* (living being) and the *ekendriya* (one-sensed being), there are three *bhanga* (divisions) (in the *sakṣaya* *nārakas* etc.)." [1865-1] [2] "Similarly, in the *krodhakṣaya* (anger-afflicted) *jīva* etc., there are also three *bhanga*. However, in the *deva* (gods), there are six *bhanga*." [1865-2] [3] "In the *mānakṣaya* (pride-afflicted) and *māyakṣaya* (deceit-afflicted) *deva* and *nārakas*, there are six *bhanga*. In the remaining *jīva* and *ekendriya*, there are three *bhanga*." [1865-3] [4] "In the *lobhakṣaya* (greed-afflicted) *nairaiyika* (non-human beings), there are six *bhanga*. In the remaining *jīva*, excluding the *jīva* and *ekendriya*, there are three *bhanga*." [1895-4]

## (1866)

"The *prakṣaya* (liberated) should be understood as being like the *nosanṇī* (non-conscious) and *noprasanṇī* (non-perceiving)." [1866]

## Commentary on the Seventh Gate:

This section of the *Prajñapana Sutra* discusses the nature of the *sakṣaya* being and its relationship to the concept of *āhāraka* and *anāhāraka*. It explains that the *sakṣaya* being, like all beings, can be both *āhāraka* and *anāhāraka* depending on its state of being. The text then goes on to explain the different *bhanga* (divisions) that exist within the *sakṣaya* beings, based on their level of *kṣaya* (affliction) and their realm of existence. 

The commentary highlights the importance of understanding the concept of *ekatva* (oneness) and *bahutva* (multiplicity) in relation to the *jīva* and the *sakṣaya* being. It emphasizes that while the *jīva* is ultimately one, it can manifest in different forms and states of being, including the *sakṣaya* state.

## Twenty-eighth Dietary Rule [139]

**Regarding the Anger Passion:**

* **One-ness:**  A being with the Anger passion is potentially a consumer or non-consumer of food.
* **Many-ness:**  In the case of a collection of beings with the Anger passion and in one-sensed beings, there is only one possibility: they are all consumers and non-consumers of food.
* **Other beings:**  Except for Devas, there are three possibilities as described above.
* **Devas:**  There are six possibilities:
    1. All Devas with the Anger passion are consumers of food. This occurs when no Deva with the Anger passion attains the state of liberation.
    2. All Devas with the Anger passion are non-consumers of food. This occurs when no Deva with the Anger passion is a consumer of food. Here, the Anger without the rise of pride, etc., is intended. Therefore, the influence of a Deva with the Anger passion being a consumer of food is possible.
    3. Some are consumers and some are non-consumers.
    4. Devas do not have an abundance of Anger, but naturally have an abundance of Greed. Therefore, a Deva with the Anger passion is rarely found.
    5. Some are consumers and one is a non-consumer.
    6. Some are consumers and some are non-consumers.

**Regarding the Pride and Delusion Passions:**

* **One-ness:**  As before, there is one possibility for each.
* **Many-ness:**  In the case of Devas and Narakas with the Pride and Delusion passions, there are six possibilities as before.
* **Devas and Narakas:**  Pride and Delusion passions are rare in Devas and Narakas. Devas have an abundance of Greed, and Narakas have an abundance of Anger. Therefore, six possibilities are possible.
* **Other beings:**  Except for a collection of beings and one-sensed beings, there are three possibilities as before.
* **Collection of beings and one-sensed beings:**  There is one possibility: they are all consumers and non-consumers of food.

**Regarding the Greed Passion:**

* **Narakas:**  There are six possibilities as before, because Narakas do not have an intense Greed.
* **Other beings:**  Except for Narakas, one-sensed beings, and a collection of beings, there are three possibilities as before.
* **Collection of beings and one-sensed beings:**  There is one possibility: they are all consumers and non-consumers of food.

**Regarding beings without passions:**

* **A being without passions:**  Only humans and Siddhas are without passions. Among humans, those with subdued passions, etc., are without passions.
* **Beings with passions:**  Besides those without passions, there are beings with passions.
* **Collection of beings, humans, and Siddhas:**  There is one possibility for a collection of beings and humans: some are consumers and some are non-consumers. For Siddhas, there is one possibility: they are non-consumers.
* **Many-ness:**  There is one possibility for a collection of beings: some are consumers and some are non-consumers. This is because there are many Kevalis (liberated souls) who are consumers and many Siddhas who are non-consumers.
* **Humans:**  There are three possibilities as before.
* **Siddhas:**  There is only one possibility: they are non-consumers.

**Note:**  The statement of a knowledgeable person should be understood as being similar to the right view.

From Nārakas to Stanitakūmāras, there are three Bhanga in Jñānī Jīvas, as mentioned above. / In Panchaindriya Tiryancha, Manusya, Vāṇavyantara, Jyotiṣka and Vaimānika, there are also three Bhanga. / In three Vikalendriya Jñānīs, six Bhanga are known. Siddha Jñānī are only Anāhāraka. In Ābhinibodha-jñānī and Śruta-jñānī, understand as before in Ekattva. In Puhatva, there are six Bhanga in three Vikalendriya.

## Twenty-eighth Dietary Rule] (141 required /  Ekeendriya beings lack Abhiniodikgyan and Shrutagnyan. Therefore, their inquiry should not be made. Avadhigyani has Avadhigyan in Panchendriya Tiryanch, Manushya, Dev and Narak, not in other beings. Therefore, except for Ekeendriya and three Vikalendriya, Panchendriya Tiryanch Avadhigyani are always Aharak / Although Panchendriya Tiryanch are Anaharak in Vigrahagati, but at that time they do not have Avadhigyan. Since Panchendriya Tiryanch have Gunapratyay Avadhigyan - it may be, but at the time of Vigrahagati, there is a lack of qualities, due to which Avadhigyan also has an effect at that time. For this reason, Avadhigyani Panchendriya Tiryanch cannot be Anaharak / Except for Ekeendriya and Vikalendriya, in addition to Panchendriya Tiryanch, in other places from Samuchchay Jeeva to Narak, Manushya and Dev of all castes, three Bhanga should be said in each, but it should be said only in those who have Avadhigyan / One should understand the previous description from the perspective of unity. In Manahparyavagyani - Manahparyavgyan is only in Manushya. Therefore, only two terms are used for it - Manahparyavagyani Jeeva and Manushya / From the perspective of unity and plurality, both these Manahparyavagyani are Aharak, not Anaharak, because Manahparyavgyan does not occur in states like Vigrahagati. In Kevalgyani, there are three terms in the description of Kevalgyani - Samuchchay Jeevapad, Manushyapad and Siddhapad / Except for these three, Kevalgyan does not exist in any other being / In the present, Kevalgyani has been described as Aharak-Anaharak-related description like No-sanjnee-No-asanjnee / That is, in Samuchchay Jeevapad and Manushyapad, from the perspective of unity, one Bhanga - perhaps Aharak and perhaps Anaharak / In Siddhapad, only Anaharak should be said / From the perspective of plurality - in Samuchchay Jeeva, there are both Aharak and Anaharak. In Manushya, the aforementioned Bhanga should be said. In Siddha, they are Anaharak. From the perspective of Agnani - in Pragyani, Matyagyani and Shrutagnyani, from the perspective of plurality, in each of the other terms except Jeeva and Ekeendriya, three Bhanga should be said / In Samuchchay Jeeva and Ekeendriya, there are both Praharak and Anaharak. In Vibhanggyani, from the perspective of unity, one should understand as before. From the perspective of plurality - Vibhanggyani Panchendriya Tiryanch and Manushya are Aharak, not Anaharak, because it is not possible for Panchendriya Tiryanch and Manushya with Vibhanggyan to be born in Vigrahagati. In places different from Panchendriya Tiryanch and Manushya, except for Ekeendriya and Vikalendriya, three Bhanga should be said in each place from Jeeva onwards. ' Ninth: Yogadwar 1600.

[145] The **Vaikriya** body is present only in the **Panchendriya** **Tiryanchas**, humans, and the gods of all four castes. The **Aharak** body is present only in humans. In **Tejas** and **Karman** bodied beings, there is a single **Aharak** and a single **Anaharak** in some cases, and in others, there is a mixture of both. In terms of plurality, there are three **Bhangas** in all beings except **Samuccaya** beings and **Ekendriya** beings. In **Samuccaya** beings and the five **Ekendriya** beings (earth-bodied, etc.), there is only one **Bhang** - **Bahut Aharak** and **Bahut Anaharak**.

**Ashariri** beings and **Siddhas** are not **Aharak**, but only **Anaharak**. Therefore, in terms of singularity and plurality, **Ashariri** and **Siddhas** are only **Anaharak**.

Until the *bhāṣā-manaḥ-paryāpti* (linguistic and mental fulfillment) and its absence in the *nārakas*, *devas*, and *manushyas* (hell beings, gods, and humans) results in six *bhangas* (categories), and until the *samuccaya jīvas* (aggregate beings) and *pancendriya-tiryañca* (five-sensed animals) different from the *nārakas*, *devas*, and *manushyas* (hell beings, gods, and humans) results in three *bhangas* (categories), it should be understood. [Thirteenth Gate] Discussion - Based on the *paryāpti* (fulfillment) gate, the *prāhārak* (eater) and *anāhārak* (non-eater) are categorized. Although other scriptures consider six *paryāptis* (fulfillments), here, *bhāṣā-paryāpti* (linguistic fulfillment) and *manaḥ-paryāpti* (mental fulfillment) are combined into one, resulting in only five *paryāptis* (fulfillments).  _The *samuccaya jīvas* (aggregate beings) and *manushyas* (humans) who are fulfilled by the *āhāradi* (food) and other five *paryāptis* (fulfillments) have three *bhangas* (categories) each.  Except for these two, the other five *paryāptis* (fulfillments) are *āhārak* (eaters) and not *anāhārak* (non-eaters).  The *ekendriyas* (one-sensed beings) and *vikaleṇdriyas* (disabled-sensed beings) do not have *bhāṣā-manaḥ-paryāpti* (linguistic and mental fulfillment).  The *anāhārak* (non-eater) is considered to be due to the absence of *āhāraparyāpti* (food fulfillment) in terms of oneness and multiplicity, not the *āhārak* (eater), because the being who is absent of *āhāraparyāpti* (food fulfillment) is found only in the *vigraha-gati* (state of disintegration).  Upon entering the *upapāta-kṣetra* (field of rebirth), it becomes fulfilled by *āhāraparyāpti* (food fulfillment) for the first time.  Therefore, it is not called *āhārak* (eater) for the first time.  There are many *anāhārak* (non-eaters) in the concept of multiplicity.  The being who is absent of *śarīraparyāpti* (body fulfillment) is sometimes *prāhārak* (eater) and sometimes *anāhārak* (non-eater).  The one who is complete in *vigraha-gati* (state of disintegration) is *anāhārak* (non-eater), and the one who reaches the *upapāta-kṣetra* (field of rebirth) is *prāhārak* (eater).

[Twenty-eighth Food-Verse] [147 .. From the perspective of oneness, due to the insufficiency of the sense organs, breath, speech, and mind, there are possibly both *āhārak* and *anāhārak*. From the perspective of plurality, there are six possibilities regarding the insufficiency of the last three or (four) perfections: (1) possibly all *anāhārak*, (2) possibly all *āhārak*, (3) possibly one *āhārak* and one *anāhārak*, (4) possibly one *āhārak*, many *anāhārak*, (5) possibly many *āhārak* and one *anāhārak*, and (6) possibly many *āhārak* and many *anāhārak*.  /  In beings other than hell-beings, gods, and humans (excluding those with one sense organ and those with a collective body), the three possibilities are found as before. Regarding the insufficiency of the body, sense organs, and breath, from the perspective of oneness, there is one possibility: many *āhārak* and many *anāhārak*. From the perspective of plurality, three possibilities are possible: (1) collective beings and those with five sense organs and are *tiryañc* are always found in large numbers, when not a single one has attained *vikraha-gati*, then all are *āhārak*, this is the first possibility, (2) when one has attained *graha-gati*, then many *āhārak* and one *anāhārak*, this is the second possibility, (3) when many beings have attained *vikraha-gati*, then many *āhārak* and many *anāhārak*, this is the third possibility.  /  In hell-beings, gods, and humans, regarding the insufficiency of speech and mind, from the perspective of plurality, there are six possibilities.  /  The statement is an exaggeration: In the last verse, the possibilities of oneness and plurality are exaggerated regarding the *āhārak* and *anāhārak* of different beings.  //  Twenty-eighth Verse of *Prajñāpanā*: The second *uddeshaka* ends.  /   //  Twenty-eighth Food-Verse of *Prajñāpanā Bhagavati* ends.  /  /  1. *Prajñāpanā*.

The 29th and 30th * *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* discuss the *upayoga* and *paśyattā* of beings. The main characteristic of a being or soul is *upayoga*, and *paśyattā* is its main part. However, the soul is bound to the body. Due to the body, limbs, senses, mind, etc., are obtained. Every being, whether it is one-sensed, disabled, or five-sensed, a god, a hell being, a human, or a non-human, receives limbs, senses, etc., according to their karma. The soul of all beings is inherently knowledge-filled and perception-filled, as stated in the *Prācārāṅga Sūtra*: "What is the soul, that is the knower, and what is the knower, that is the soul. What is known, that is the soul." The question arises: If all souls are knowledge-perception-filled (*upayoga*-filled), formless, and eternal, as stated in the *Bhagavati Sūtra*: "The soul is without smell, without form, without taste, without touch, and without breath. It is eternal and pervades the entire universe. It is described in five ways: substance, space, time, nature, and qualities. The substance is infinite, the space is the size of the universe, the time is eternal, the nature is without form, and the qualities are *upayoga* qualities." Here, the nature of the soul is described in five ways. The substance is infinite, the space is the size of the universe, the time is eternal, the nature is without form, and the qualities are *upayoga* qualities. Therefore, even though all souls have the same qualities and *upayoga*, some have less *upayoga*, some have more, some have knowledge that pervades the three times and three worlds, and some have no knowledge or perception even of the present moment or a single inch of space. Why is this? 1. *Upayoga* is the characteristic - *Tattvārtha Sūtra* 2. *Prācārāṅga Sūtra* 1, 5, 5, 165 3. *Bhagavati Sūtra* 2, 10, 5 (Prā. Pr. Samiti)

**Primary [149 Its solution is - the peculiarity of knowledge-revealing and vision-revealing karmas / The more the veil of knowledge-vision is weakened, the more its use will be, the more intense the knowledge-vision veil is, the more its consumption will be slow. * This is the reason why the diversity of uses of various beings is described here. * The meaning of use is the activity by which the being is pervaded to know the object, or the being's knowledge-form is the essential activity / * The thirtieth step is Pasyatta-Pasanyaya / Both use and Pasyatta are the knowledge-form activities of the being, there is no explanation of these two in the root. According to the ancient method, the difference is their explanation / Acharya Abhaydevsuri has described Pasyatta as a special use. But later on, it has been clarified that the knowledge in which there is a temporal understanding is Pasyatta and the knowledge in which there is present-time knowledge is use. This is the difference between the two. Just as there are two main types of use - Sakaroyoga and Anakaroyoga, in the same way, there are two types of Pasyatta - Sakarapasyatta and Anakarapasyatta. But according to the above-mentioned characteristics of both, Mati-knowledge and Mati-ignorance are not included in the types of Sakarapasyatta, because the subject of Mati-knowledge and Mati-ignorance is the present-time non-destroyed substance. In addition, Prachakshadarshan is not included in Anakarapasyatta, its solution has been given by Acharya Abhaydevsuri as follows: Pasyatta is excellent vision and observation is possible only through eye-vision, not in the vision that takes place through other senses / The use of the eye is short-term compared to other senses and where there is short-term use, there is more speed in the knowledge activity, this is the reason for the excellence of Pasyatta. Acharya Malayagiri has followed Acharya Abhaydevsuri. He has clarified that the word Pasyatta is the proponent of Sakar and Anakar knowledge due to tradition. In particular, it should be understood that where there is long-term use, there is temporal knowledge possible / There is no long-term use in Mati-knowledge, therefore, it does not have tri-temporal knowledge / Therefore, it has not been given a place in 'Pasyatta' / * In the twenty-ninth step, Sakaroyoga and Anakaroyoga, the differences are explained as follows / After that, four types of these two are explained respectively. * The difference between Sakaroyoga and Anakaroyoga and Sakarapasyatta and Anakarapasyatta will be clearly understood from the following table: 1.

Discussion-Usage: The usage is the employment-business that is done by the soul for the knowledge of the object's delimitation. In reality, usage is the soul's knowledge-form dharma or business. It has two divisions: concrete usage and abstract usage / To grasp the definite object or the special dharma of the object is form. That which is with form is concrete / That is, special-grasping knowledge is called concrete usage. The intention is that when the soul, while employing itself in a conscious or unconscious object, grasps the object with its modifications, then its usage is called concrete usage. From the perspective of time, the usage of the liberated souls remains until the end of the moment, and the usage of the bound souls remains only for a while. The usage in which the aforementioned form is not present is called abstract usage. To delimit the object generally, to know only its existence is abstract usage / Abstract usage is also momentary for the liberated souls. But the time of concrete usage should be known to be many times more than the time of abstract usage. Because it takes more time to be the receiver of the special. The time of abstract usage of the bound souls is only for one moment. From the table given on page 156, the information about concrete and abstract usage in the souls will be easily understood.

##  Translation:

**[156]** How many are the *saakaropayog* (material objects of perception) of living beings? How many are the *anaakaropayog* (immaterial objects of perception)? 

The *saakaropayog* are eight in number because of the aggregate of causes, and the *anaakaropayog* are four in number. This is because both *samyagdrishti* (right faith) and *mithyaadrishti* (wrong faith) living beings are found in them. Therefore, the eight *saakaropayog* and the four *anaakaropayog* are of ten types in the *nairyik* (worldly) realm: 

* **Bhavanapati** (lords of the mansions)
* **Panchendriya-tiryanch** (five-sensed animals)
* **Baanavyantar** (intermediate beings)
* **Dev** (gods)
* **Jyotishk Dev** (luminous gods)
* **Vaimanik Dev** (aerial gods)

All of these have six types of *matijnana* (knowledge through perception), *shrutajnana* (knowledge through scriptures), and *avadhijnana* (clairvoyance).

* **Chakshudarshan-anaakaropayog** (perception through the eye) has *matijnana*, *shrutajnana*, and *vibhangajnana* (knowledge of differentiation).
* **Achakshudarshan-anaakaropayog** (perception without the eye) has *avadhijnana*.
* **Narak** (hell beings), **tiryanch-panchendriya** (five-sensed animals), **bhavanapati** (lords of the mansions), **baanavyantar** (intermediate beings), **jyotishk dev** (luminous gods), and **vaimanik dev** (aerial gods) are both *samyagdrishti* (right faith) and *mithyaadrishti* (wrong faith). 

* **Samyagdrishti** (right faith) has three types of knowledge, while **mithyaadrishti** (wrong faith) has three types of ignorance. Both have three types of *anaakaropayog* (immaterial objects of perception).

* **Two types of *mati-ajnana* (ignorance through perception) and *shruta-ajnana* (ignorance through scriptures) *saakaropayog* (material objects of perception)** are found in the five types of stationary beings (earth-bodied, etc.), one-sensed beings, two-sensed beings, three-sensed beings, and four-sensed beings.

* **Four types of *matijnana* (knowledge through perception) and *shrutajnana* (knowledge through scriptures) and *matijnana* (knowledge through perception) and *shruta-ajnana* (ignorance through scriptures) *saakaropayog* (material objects of perception)** are found in the four-sensed beings.

* **One type of *samyagdarshan* (right faith) is absent, resulting in two types of *achakshudarshan-anaakaropayog* (perception without the eye) due to ignorance and one type of *prachakshudarshan-anaakaropayog* (perception with the eye) due to the absence of the eye sense.**

* **Three types of *vikaleindriya* (disabled-sensed) beings have one type of *prachakshudarshan-anaakaropayog* (perception with the eye) due to the absence of the eye sense.**

* **Three types of *vikaleindriya* (disabled-sensed) beings have *matijnana* (knowledge through perception) and *shrutajnana* (knowledge through scriptures) and experience the taste of *saasvadanabhaav* (pleasantness). They have two types of *chakshudarshan* (perception through the eye) and *achakshudarshan* (perception without the eye) in the state of *aparayaaptaavastha* (incomplete attainment). Therefore, they also have two types of knowledge.**

* **Four-sensed beings have the eye sense and therefore experience *chakshudarshan* (perception through the eye).**

[157, 1928]  O Bhagavan! Are jivas (living beings) suitable for the use of the form (saakara) or the formless (anaakara)? {1628} Gautama! Jivas are suitable for the use of both the form and the formless. [Question] O Bhagavan! Why do you say that jivas are suitable for the use of both the form and the formless? [Answer] Gautama! Those jivas who are endowed with the use of Abhinibodhik-jnana (perfect knowledge), Shruta-jnana (scriptural knowledge), Avadhi-jnana (clairvoyance), Manah-paryaya-jnana (knowledge of the mind), Kevala-jnana (omniscience), and Mati-ajnana (knowledge of the mind), Shruta-ajnana (scriptural knowledge), and Vibhang-jnana (knowledge of the parts) are called saakara-upayukta (suitable for the use of the form). And those jivas who are endowed with the use of Chakshu-darshan (visual perception), Achakshu-darshan (non-visual perception), Avadhi-darshan (clairvoyance), and Kevala-darshan (omniscience) are called anaakara-upayukta (suitable for the use of the formless). Therefore, O Gautama! It is said that jivas are suitable for the use of both the form and the formless. 1926. [Question] O Bhagavan! Are the beings in hell (nairyika) suitable for the use of the form or the formless? [Answer] Gautama! The beings in hell are suitable for the use of both the form and the formless. [Question] O Bhagavan! Why do you say that the beings in hell are suitable for the use of both the form and the formless? [Answer] Gautama! Those beings in hell who are endowed with the use of Abhinibodhik-jnana (perfect knowledge), Shruta-jnana (scriptural knowledge), Avadhi-jnana (clairvoyance), and Mati-ajnana (knowledge of the mind), Shruta-ajnana (scriptural knowledge), and Vibhang-jnana (knowledge of the parts) are called saakara-upayukta (suitable for the use of the form). And those beings in hell who are endowed with the use of Chakshu-darshan (visual perception), Achakshu-darshan (non-visual perception), and Avadhi-darshan (clairvoyance) are called anaakara-upayukta (suitable for the use of the formless). Therefore, O Gautama! It is said that the beings in hell are suitable for the use of both the form and the formless. 1930. The same statement should be made about the beings in the womb (thanikumaras). [1630] 1631. [Question] O Gautama! What about the beings in the earth (pudhavikaaya)? [Answer] Gautama! Those beings in the earth who are endowed with the use of Mati-ajnana (knowledge of the mind), Shruta-ajnana (scriptural knowledge) are called saakara-upayukta (suitable for the use of the form). And those beings in the earth who are endowed with the use of Achakshu-darshan (non-visual perception) are called anaakara-upayukta (suitable for the use of the formless). Therefore, O Gautama! It is said that the beings in the earth are suitable for the use of both the form and the formless. The same statement should be made about the beings in the water (vanaphai-kaaya).

---------------------------
[158] [1631 pr.] The same question regarding the Earth-bodied beings? [1631 ut.] Gautama! As before (like the hell-beings etc.), those Earth-bodied beings who have the use of *Matyajnan* and *Upayog* are *Sakaropayukta*, and those Earth-bodied beings who have the use of *Achakshudarshan* are *Anakaroupayukta*. For this reason, O Gautama! It is said that Earth-bodied beings are both *Sakaropayukta* and *Anakaroupayukta*. Similarly, for the aforementioned reasons, *Apkayika*, *Vayukayika*, *Tejaskayika*, and *Vanaspatikayika* are also both *Sakaropayukta* and *Anakaroupayukta*. 1932. [1] Regarding the *Dwindriya* beings, the same question. Gautama! Those *Dwindriya* beings who have the use of *Abhinibodhikgyan*, *Shrutajnan*, *Matyajnan*, and *Shruta-Ajnan* are *Sakaropayukta*, and those *Dwindriya* beings who have the use of *Achakshudarshan* are *Anakaroupayukta*. For this reason, O Gautama! It is said that *Dwindriya* beings are both *Sakaropayukta* and *Anakaroupayukta*. [2] Similarly, one should understand regarding the *Triindriya* and *Chaturindriya* beings; it is special to say that *Chakshudarshan* is more in *Chaturindriya* beings. 1933. The *Panchendriya-Tiryagyonika* are like the *Nairyika* (as stated in Sutra 1929). 1934. The statement regarding humans is like the statement regarding all beings (as stated in Sutra 1928). 1935. The statement regarding *Vanamantara-Jotishiya-Vemagiya* is like the statement regarding *Gairyika* (as stated in Sutra 1926). // The thirty-first *Uvamogaparyaya* of the *Pannavanaya Bhagavati* is complete. //

The twenty-ninth Upayapada [159 [1935] Vaanavyantara, Jyotishka and Vaimanika Devas, in the same way as the Nairyaikas (it should be said!), discussed in eight sutras (from Sutra 1918 to 1635) has stated the cause of the applicability and non-applicability of the Sakara Upayoga and Anaakara Upayoga in the Samuccaya Jivas and Chaubisa Dandaka Jivas. The statement is clear. // The twenty-ninth Upayapada of Prajnaapana Bhagavati is complete. // 10

In the thirty-second chapter of the Tīrthankara's teachings, the thirty-second chapter of the Pasyattāpada Jīva, and the twenty-four chapters of the Daṇḍakas, the different types of Pasyattā are explained. 1936. How many types of Pasyattā are there, Bhante? [1636] Gautama! There are two types of Pasyattā. [1636] They are: Sākārapasyattā and Anākārapasyattā. 1937. How many types of Sākārapasyattā are there, Bhante? [1637] Gautama! There are six types of Sākārapasyattā. [1937] They are: (1) Śruta-jñāna-sākārapasyattā, (2) Avadhi-jñāna-sākārapasyattā, (3) Manaḥ-paryav-jñāna-sākārapasyattā, (4) Kevala-jñāna-sākārapasyattā, (5) Śruta-ajñāna-sākārapasyattā, and (6) Vibhangajñāna-sākārapasyattā. 1938. How many types of Anākārapasyattā are there, Bhante? [1638] Gautama! There are three types of Anākārapasyattā. [1938] They are: (1) Cakṣu-darśana-anākārapasyattā, (2) Avadhi-darśana-anākārapasyattā, and (3) Kevala-darśana-anākārapasyattā. [1636] In the same way (six types of Sākārapasyattā and three types of Anākārapasyattā) should be said for the Jīvas. 1. The Sanskrit equivalent of the word 'Pasyattā' is 'Pasyanaka-Pasyanā', which can easily lead to the misconception that it is related to the 'Vipassanā' of Buddhism. However, this misconception is dispelled by the previous descriptions.  S.

## Prajñāpanā Sūtra 1947-1953: Translation with Jain Terms

**1947.**  O Bhagavan! How many types of *paśyattā* (perception) are there for *dvi-indriya* (two-sensed) beings? 
**1947.**  Gautama! There is only one type of *paśyattā* for them, called *sākāra-paśyattā* (perception of form).

**1948.**  O Bhagavan! How many types of *sākāra-paśyattā* are there for *dvi-indriya* beings?
**1948.**  Gautama! There are two types: *śruta-jñāna-sākāra-paśyattā* (perception of form through knowledge acquired by hearing) and *śruta-ajñāna-sākāra-paśyattā* (perception of form through knowledge not acquired by hearing).

**1946.**  Similarly, the *paśyattā* of *tri-indriya* (three-sensed) beings should also be understood.

**1950.**  O Bhagavan! How many types of *paśyattā* are there for *catur-indriya* (four-sensed) beings?
**1950.**  Gautama! There are two types: *sākāra-paśyattā* (perception of form) and *anākāra-paśyattā* (perception of formless). The *sākāra-paśyattā* of *catur-indriya* beings should be understood as similar to the *sākāra-paśyattā* of *dvi-indriya* beings (as explained in Sūtra 1947-48).

**1951.**  O Bhagavan! How many types of *anākāra-paśyattā* are there for *catur-indriya* beings?
**1951.**  Gautama! There is only one type: *caksu-darśana-anākāra-paśyattā* (perception of formless through the eye).

**1952.**  The *sākāra-paśyattā* and *anākāra-paśyattā* of humans are the same as those of all living beings (as explained in Sūtra 1936).

**1953.**  The *paśyattā* of all other *daṇḍaka* (categories of beings) from *raiyā* (hell beings) to *vaimānika* (celestial beings) should be understood as similar to that of *nairyika* (hell beings) (as explained in Sūtra 1940-42).

## Thirty-first Pasyattapad] (163)

**Difference between Vivechana-Upayoga and Pasyatta** - The original text does not mention any difference between the two. From a grammatical perspective, Pasyatta means the feeling of seeing. Like the word Upayoga, Pasyatta also has two types. Acharya Abhaydeva has provided a slight clarification, stating that Pasyatta is a specific type of Upayoga, but there is a subtle difference between the two. The knowledge that involves only the understanding of the three times (long-term) is called 'Pasyatta', while the knowledge that involves only the understanding of the present time is called Upayoga. This is why Matigyan and Matygyan are not included in the types of Sakarapasyatta, as both of these deal with the present-time, non-destroyed substance. Anachara Pasyatta does not include Prachakshudarshan because Pasyatta is a type of superior observation, which is possible only through the eye sense. Compared to other senses, the use of the eye sense is short-term and faster, which is the reason for the observational superiority of Pasyatta. Therefore, the characteristic of Anachara Pasyatta is that it is seen in a specific, clear form. This characteristic can only occur in Chakshudarshan, Avadhi Darshan, and Keval Darshan. In fact, according to ancient commentators, the difference between Pasyatta and Upayoga highlights their explanation.

**Proof of Sakarapasyatta** - Prabhinibodhikgyan is called Sakarapasyatta, which is in the form of Avgraha, arises from the senses and mind, and is the recipient of the present-time object. From this perspective, Matigyan and Matygyan do not have Sakarapasyatta, while the six types of knowledge, including Shrutagnyan, are recipients of the past and future objects, and therefore fall under the meaning of the word Sakarapasyatta. Shrutagnyan is related to the three times. Avadhigyan is also related to the three times because it knows the countless past and future Utsapinis and Pravapinis. Manahparyavgyan is also related to the three times because it is the divider of the countless parts of the past and future time of Palyopama. The three-time nature of Kevalgyan is well-known. Shrutagyan and Vibhanggyan are also related to the three times because they are the dividers of the past and future states, as appropriate. Therefore, the aforementioned six types of knowledge can be considered Sakarapasyatta.

**Description of Sakarapasyatta and Anachara Pasyatta in Jivas and Twenty-Four Tattvas**

1954. Jiva, Bante! Is there Sakarapasyatta and Anachara Pasyatta in Jivas?

Go-yama! There is both Sakarapasyatta and Anachara Pasyatta in Jivas.

Why, Bante! How is it said that there is both Sakarapasyatta and Anachara Pasyatta in Jivas?

Go-yama! Jivas who have Shuyana, Ohina, Manaprajavana, Kevalana, Shuyana, Vibhangana are Sakarapasyatta. Jivas who have Chakshudarshan, Mohivansana, Kevaldarshan are Anachara Pasyatta.

Therefore, Go-yama! It is said that there is both Sakarapasyatta and Anachara Pasyatta in Jivas.

[164] [Prajñāpanasūtra [1954 Pr.] Bhagavan! Are jīvas sākarapasyattā वाले or anākarapasyattā वाले? [1954 U.] Gautama! Jīvas are both sākarapasyattā वाले and anākarapasyattā वाले! [Pr.] Bhagavan! Why do you say that jīvas are both sākarapasyattā वाले and anākarapasyattā वाले? U.] Gautama! Those jīvas who are śruta-jñānī, avadhi-jñānī, manaḥ-paryav-jñānī, kevala-jñānī, śruta-ajñānī and vibhang-jñānī are sākarapasyattā वाले, and those jīvas who are cakṣadarsanī, aśanī, avadhi-darsanī and kevala-darsanī are anākarapasyattā वाले. For this reason, O Gautama! It is said that jīvas are both sākarapasyattā वाले and anākarapasyattā वाले / 1955. Raiyā naṁ bhanta! Ki sāgārapassi praṇāgārapassi? Goyamā!

As before (both types are there /) but in these, in the form of sākarapasyattā (in nairyayikas) manaḥ-paryāy-jñānī and kevala-jñānī should not be said, and in anākarapasyattā there is no kevala-darsan. 1956.

Why is it said that 'pṛthvīkāyika jīvas are sākarapasyattā वाले, not anākarapasyattā वाले? [U.] Gautama! In pṛthvīkāyikas, only śruta-ajñāna (being) is called sākarapasyattā. For this reason, O Gautama! It is said that pṛthvīkāyika are sākarapasyattā वाले, not anākarapasyattā वाले /

[30 Pasyattapad] - [2] and as far as the Vanaspatikayikas / [1957-2] In the same way (from Apkayika to) as far as the Vanaspatikayikas (it should be said /) 1958. Beindiyan asked. Gotama! Sagarapassi, not Anagarapassi. Why, Bhante! Is this said so? Gotama! Beindiyan have two types of Sagarapassana. Just as Suyanasana Sagarapassana and Suyprananasa Sagarapassana, that is why, Gotama! This is said so / [1658 u.] Gautama! They are Sagarapasyatta, not Anagarapasyatta / [Pr.] Bhagavan! Why is it said that the Dwindriya are Sagarapasyatta, not Anagarapasyatta? [U.] Gautama! There are two types of Pasyatta of Dwindriya beings / such as - Shrutagyanasa Sagarapasyatta and Shruta-Agyanasa Sagarapasyatta / Therefore, O Gautama! It is said that Dwindriya are Sagarapasyatta, not Anagarapasyatta / 1656. In the same way, one should understand about Triindriya beings / [1656] In the same way, one should understand about Triindriya beings. 1960. Charidiyan asked. Gotama! Charidiya are Sagarapassi and Anagarapassi / Why? Gotama! Those Charidiya who are Suyanani Sutamanani, they are Charidiya Sagarapassi, those Charidiya who are Chakkhuvansani, they are Charidiya Anagarapassi, that is why, Gotama! This is said so / [1960 Pr.] Bhagavan! Are Chaturindriya beings Sagarapasyatta or Anagarapasyatta? 1960 u.] Gautama! Chaturindriya beings are Sagarapasyatta and Anagarapasyatta. [Pr. Bhagavan! Why is it said that Chaturindriya beings are Sagarapasyatta and Anagarapasyatta?

Page #1361:
---------------------------
Those who are Mithila and who have four senses and are eye-seeing, are those who have non-form perception. For this reason, O Gautama! It is said that those who have four senses are both form-seeing and non-form-seeing. 1961. The statement relating to humans (as stated in Su. 1654) is similar to the aggregate beings. 1962. The remaining all (Vaṇavyantara, Jyotiṣka and) up to the Vaimānika, in relation to (as stated in Su. 1655) the Nairyikas are similar (to know /) discussion - which beings have form-perception and non-form-perception and why? - (1) Among the aggregate beings, those beings who are Śruta-jñānī, Avadhi-jñānī, Manaḥ-paryav-jñānī or Kevala-jñānī or Śruta-jñānī or Vibhang-jñānī, are form-seeing, because their knowledge is associated with form-perception. Those beings who are Cakṣu-darśanī, Avadhi-darśanī and Kevala-darśanī, are non-form-seeing, because their perception is non-form-perception. Humans also have both form-perception and non-form-perception, similar to the aggregate beings. Narakas are also form-seeing and non-form-seeing, but Narakas are not endowed with Manaḥ-paryav-jñāna and Kevala-jñāna form of form-perception, nor are they non-form-seeing in the form of Kevala-darśana / The reason for this is that Narakas cannot adopt the four virtues, therefore these three are not possible in them / The five one-sensed, two-sensed and three-sensed beings of the earth body etc. are form-seeing, not non-form-seeing, because one-sensed beings have Śruta-jñāna form of form-perception, not non-form-perception, because they do not have specific clear perception form of perception / Four-sensed beings have both perceptions, because they have the eye sense, so they also have Cakṣu-darśana form of non-form-perception. Four-sensed beings are Śruta-jñānī and Śruta-jñānī, so they are endowed with form-perception / Bhavanapati Vaṇavyantara, Jyotiṣka and Vaimānika beings are endowed with form-perception and non-form-perception like Narakas. 'The prohibition of both uses at the same time in Kevali is a formulation 1963. Kevali, O Bhante! This ray of light is given to the earth by the following reasons, by the following arrangements, by the following measures, by the following means, at the time he knows, does he also pass that time?

Does the Kevali know this Ratnaprabhaprithvi by shapes, reasons, comparisons, examples, colors, institutions, proofs, and incarnations, at the time he knows, he sees, and at the time he sees, he knows? [1963 U.] Gautama! This meaning (matter) is not possible (feasible). [Pr.] Bhagavan! For what reason is it said that the Kevali does not see this Ratnaprabhaprithvi by shapes until incarnations at the time he knows, and does not know at the time he sees? [U.] Gautama! What is concrete is knowledge, and what is abstract is perception, (therefore, at the time of concrete knowledge, abstract knowledge (perception) will not remain, similarly, at the time of abstract knowledge (perception), concrete knowledge will not be there. For this reason, O Gautama! It is said that the Kevali does not see at the time he knows, until he does not know / Similarly, one should know about the Sharkaraprabhaprithvi until the seventh earth below, and similarly (the statement) from the Saudharmakalp until the Achyutakalp, Aveyakavimana, Anuttaravimana, Ishipragbharaprithvi, Paramanu-pudgala, Dvipradeshik Skandha until Anantapradeshik Skandha (should be understood regarding knowing and seeing. That is, at the time the Kevali knows these, he does not see, and at the time he sees, he does not know). 1964. Kevali, O Bhagavan! Does he see this Ratnaprabhaprithvi by abstract forms, without reasons, without comparisons, without examples, without colors, without institutions, without proofs, and without incarnations, and does not know? [1664 U.] Yes, Gautama! The Kevali does not know this Ratnaprabhaprithvi by abstract forms until he sees it.

---------------------------
168 [Prajñāpanasūtra [Pr.] Bhagavan! Why is it said that the Kevali sees this Ratnaprabhā earth from the anākāras, but does not know it? [U.] Gautama! What is anākāra is perception (seeing), and what is sākara is knowledge (knowing).  /  With this meaning, O Gautama! It is said that the Kevali sees this Ratnaprabhā earth from the anākāras, but does not know it. In the same way (from the anākāras, up to the six hells, the vimānas of the Vaimānika devas), up to the Īṣatprārabharā earth, the paramāṇu-pudgala, and the ananta-pradeśī skandha, the Kevali sees, but does not know. (This should be said  / ) Discussion- The discussion of the non-simultaneity of knowledge and perception by the Kevali (1) The reason for the rise of this question- The chhadmastha jīva is karma-yukt, therefore, his sākaropāyoga and anākāropāyoga can only manifest in sequence, because for a jīva covered by karmas, at the time of one use, the other use is covered by karma. For this reason, the simultaneous occurrence of two uses is contradictory. Therefore, at the time the chhadmastha knows, he does not see, but he can only see afterwards  /  But the Kevali's four ghatika karmas have been destroyed. Therefore, due to the complete destruction of the jñānāvaraṇīya karmas, there is no contradiction or obstacle for them to have both knowledge and perception simultaneously. With this apprehension, Gautama-svāmī raised this question: Does the Kevali know and see the Ratnaprabhā earth etc. at the same time, or does he know and see them in sequence due to the nature of the jīva?' Explanation of the words Prāgārehi etc.- (1) Prāgārehi Bhagavan Kevali sees this Ratnaprabhā earth etc., i.e., from the shapes and forms, as this Ratnaprabhā earth is of three types: kharkaṇḍa, pankakaṇḍa, and akāṇḍa. There are sixteen types of kharkaṇḍa. Among them, one is the ratnakaṇḍa of a thousand yojanas in measure, then there is the vanakaṇḍa of a thousand yojanas, then below that is the vaidūryakaṇḍa of a thousand yojanas, etc. To understand from the shapes and forms of this type. (2) Hehiṁ- From the hetu, i.e., from the upapattis, from the yuktis  /  For example, why is this earth called Ratnaprabhā? The solution to this by yukti etc. is that because it is ratnamayakaṇḍa, or because it is the prabhā or form of ratna, or because it is ratnamayakaṇḍa, it has the prabhākānti of ratnas, therefore, the name Ratnaprabhā of this earth is meaningful. (3) Uvamāhi- From the upamās, i.e., from the sadṛśatās. For example- In Ratnaprabhā, there are kaṇḍas like Ratnaprabhā etc., which are similar in color to padmarāga  /  (4) Diḷēntehi- From the drṣṭāntas, examples, or from the vādi-prativādī's buddhi samatā-pratipādaka vākyas  /  For example- Just as a ghaṭa, a paṭa etc. are different, so also this Ratnaprabhā earth is different from other naraka-pṛthvīs like Śarkarāprabhā etc., because its dharma is different from them. Therefore, Ratnaprabhā is a different thing from Śarkarāprabhā etc., etc.  /  (5) Vaṇṇehi- From the difference of varṇa, gandha etc.  /  From the division of saṁkhyāta-guṇa, asaṁkhyāta-guṇa, and ananta-guṇa in the form of utkarṣa-apakarṣa of the śukla etc. classes, and from the division of gandha, rasa, and sparśa  /  (6) Saṁṭhāṇehi- From the saṁsthānas, shapes, i.e., from the shapes of the buildings and narakavāsas built in the Ratnaprabhā earth. For example- Those buildings are round on the outside and inside 1. Prajñāpanā. (Prameyabodhinīṭīkā) Bhā. 5, p. 747-748

## Thirty-first Pasyattapad

[169] They are square, below the Pushkar, the Kanika are of the nature of the earth. / In the same way, the Naraka are round inside and square outside, and below they are shaped like a Kharpa (a type of spade), etc. / (7) By Pramanehi - by measurements, i.e., by the measurements of its length, thickness, width, etc. For example, it is one lakh eighty thousand yojanas thick and has the length and width of a Rajju (rope), etc. / (8) By Padoyarehi - by the Pratyavataras, i.e., by the substances (Pratyavataras) that completely encompass it on all sides. / For example, the Ghanodadhi and other rings remain encompassing in all directions and sub-directions, therefore they are called Pratyavataras. Knowing by such Pratyavataras.

The meaning of the first question - Does the Kevali Bhagavan, at the time when he knows the Ratnaprabha, etc., with his Kevalgyan, also see them with his Kevaldarshan, and at the time when he sees them with his Kevaldarshan, does he also know them with his Kevalgyan?

The explanation of the answer - The answer to the above question is 'No'. Because the Kevali Bhagavan's knowledge is Sakar, i.e., it is the recipient of the specific, while his Darshan is Anakar, i.e., it is the recipient of the general. Therefore, it is said that when the Kevali Bhagavan, by means of knowledge, makes a specific distinction, then he knows, and when he, by means of Darshan, receives the Anakar, i.e., the general, then he sees.

Specifically, पुनर्ज्ञानम्, according to this characteristic, the knowledge of an object with its specific qualities or the knowledge that is the recipient of the specific is called knowledge. Therefore, the Kevali's knowledge is the recipient of the Sakar, i.e., the specific, otherwise it cannot be called knowledge, and Darshan is the recipient of the Anakar, i.e., the general, because the characteristic of Darshan is - 'to receive objects without their specific qualities'. Therefore, the principle is that when there is knowledge, there is only knowledge, and when there is Darshan, there is only Darshan. Knowledge and Darshan are like shadow and sunlight, being Sakar and Anakar, respectively, and are therefore mutually contradictory. These two cannot coexist. Therefore, the Kevali does not see at the time when he knows, and he does not know at the time when he sees. It is not possible for knowledge and Darshan to exist simultaneously in parts, i.e., for knowledge to be in some parts of the Jiva and Darshan in other parts.

This principle should be understood with the same logic in the case of the seven Naraka-prithvis, the Vimanas up to the Anuttaravimana, the Ishtaprarabhara-prithvi, the Paramanu, the Dvipradeshi to the Anantapradeshi Skandha.

The meaning of the second question - Does the Kevali, at the time when he sees this Ratnaprabha-prithvi, etc., with the Anakaras (formless forms), etc., only see them and not know them?

The explanation of the answer - Bhagavan accepts this as 'Yes', because receiving an object in the form of Anakar, etc., is the work of Darshan, not of knowledge. The work of knowledge is to receive an object in the form of Sakar, etc.

In clear words, when the Ratnaprabha, etc., are received in the form of Anakar, etc., as general, 1. Prajnapanna. (Prameyabodhini Tika), Bha. 5, pp. 748 to 751 2. Ibid., Bha. 5, pp. 751 to 753.

17.] According to the *Prajñāpanā Sūtra*, when one perceives, it is only *darśana* (perception), not *jñāna* (knowledge). Knowledge arises only when one perceives an object in its concrete form, etc. The special meanings of the terms "aṇāgārehi" etc. are: (1) "praṇāgārehi" - devoid of the aforementioned forms and types of forms; (2) "ahetūhi" - devoid of cause, reasoning, etc.; (3) "aṇuvamāhi" - devoid of similarities, comparisons, etc.; (4) "adiḷēntehi" - devoid of examples, illustrations, etc.; (5) "śravaṇehi" - devoid of sounds, i.e., devoid of categories like white, etc., and devoid of smell, taste, and touch; (6) "asaṁṭhāṇehi" - devoid of structures, i.e., devoid of specific arrangements; (7) "apamāṇehi" - devoid of measurements, i.e., devoid of specific measurements like length, width, height, etc.; (8) "apḍoyārehi" - devoid of pervasiveness, i.e., devoid of the state of being pervaded by rings like the ocean, etc. They only see. The conclusion is that when a Kevali perceives an object like a jewel, etc., with only *darśana*, they do not know, they only see. And when they know, they do not see. Therefore, the scriptural authors say, "When a Kevali sees with only *darśana*, they do not know." // The thirtieth *paśyattāpada* of the *Prajñāpanā Bhagavati* is complete. // 0 1. *Prajñāpanā* ( *Prameyabodhinī Ṭīkā*), Vol. 5, pp. 754-756 2.

This thirty-first 'Sanjñipad' of the Prajñāpanā Sūtra discusses all beings, including Siddhas, based on three categories: Sanjñī, Asanjñī, and No-Sanjñī-No-Asanjñī. * This section explains that Siddhas are neither Sanjñī nor Asanjñī, their state is No-Sanjñī-No-Asanjñī because, despite having a mind, they do not acquire knowledge through its activity. Similarly, humans who have attained Kevalīhood are considered No-Sanjñī-No-Asanjñī, as they too do not gain knowledge through mental activity.  /  Other humans, born in the womb and those who have attained Sammūcchima, are respectively Sanjñī and Asanjñī. All beings from Ekendriya to Chaturindriya are Asanjñī. Narakas, Bhavanapatis, Vāṇavyantara, and Panchendriya-Tiryach are both Sanjñī and Asanjñī. Jyotishkas and Vaimānikas are both Sanjñī. * The concluding verse of this section states that humans are either Sanjñī or Asanjñī, but Sūtra 1670 mentions three types of humans. This suggests that the verse refers to humans in a state of Chhadmastha. * However, the meaning of Sanjñā is not clear here. Humans, Narakas, Bhavanapatis, and Vyantaradevas are described as Asanjñī, indicating that beings with a mind are considered Sanjñī. This meaning does not fit the present context. This is why the Vṛttikāra had to interpret the word Sanjñā in two ways.  /  Still, a complete solution was not found, leading the Tīkākara to explain that Narakas, etc., are Sanjñī and Asanjñī because they were Sanjñī or Asanjñī in their previous births. Therefore, the meaning of the word Sanjñā in this context remains a subject of research. 1. Paṇṇavaṇā Sutta, Part 2 (Appendix, Introduction), p. 142 2. 'Sanjñinaḥ Samanaskaḥ  / ' -Tattvārtha. 2025 3.

[172] In the beginning of the Prajñāpanā Sūtra and the Pācārāṅga Sūtra, the term 'saṁjñā' is used in the context of knowledge of past lives, meaning a specific type of matigñāna. Similarly, in the Daśāśruta Skandha, where the ten citta-samādhi-sthānas are described, the term 'saṁjñā' is used in the sense of remembering one's past births. This suggests that the term 'saṁjñā' was first used in the specific sense of matigñāna, and over time it came to be used in the sense of remembering past experiences or jāti-smaraṇa-jñāna. Whatever the case may be, the term 'saṁjñā' refers to a specific type of matigñāna, whether it is in the form of saṁjñā-saṁketa-śabda or in the form of a sign. Remembering is essential for knowledge to arise. In the Sthānāṅga Sūtra, we also find the phrase "ega saṇṇā". Therefore, there was certainly a specific knowledge known as 'saṁjñā' in ancient times. In the Āvaśyaka Niyukti, saṁjñā is also called abhinibodha (matigñāna). In the 'Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama', there is a saṁjñī-dvāra in the Mārgaṇādvāra of the मूल. However, the actual meaning of 'saṁjñā' is not explained there. While describing saṁjñī and pra-saṁjñī, it is stated that beings from the mithyā-dṛṣṭi-guṇasthāna to the kṣīṇa-kaṣāya-vītarāga-chhadmastha guṇasthāna are saṁjñī, and beings from the eka-indriya to the pañc-endriya are asaṁjñī. It is also stated that saṁjñī arises from kṣaya-upaśamika-labdhi, asaṁjñī from audayika-bhāva, and na-saṁjñī, na-asaṁjñī from kṣayika-labdhi. In explaining this, the 'Dhavala' gives two interpretations of the term 'saṁjñī', which are worth considering: samyag jānāti iti saṁjñā = manaḥ, tadasyāsti iti saṁjñī / naika-indriyādina ati-prasangaḥ, tasya manaso bhāvāt / athavā śikṣā-kriyā-upadeśa-ālāpa-grāhi saṁjñī / uktam ca _ 'sikkhā-kiriyuva-deśa-ālāva-vaggāhi maṇo-valambena' / jo jīvo so saṇṇī, tasvi-vīrido asaṇṇī du॥ Even in this second interpretation, the dependence on the mind is accepted. There is no difference in the meaning. In the Tattvārtha Sūtra, it is stated that "saṁjñinaḥ samanaskāḥ" (saṁjñī beings are those who have a mind), and the commentary explains that the term 'saṁjñī' here refers to those beings who have sampradhāna-saṁjñā. The characteristic of sampradhāna-saṁjñā is described as īhā-poha-yukta guṇa-doṣa-vicāraṇātmikā sampra 1. (a) 'matiḥ smṛtiḥ saṁjñā cintā....ityanarthāntaram / ' -Tattvārtha.

[Primary] [173 Dharana-samjna - i.e. - the conceptual-samjna which considers the qualities and defects with both affirmation and negation. Its implication is that the sentient beings (those with mind) are those who are called sentient due to the conceptual-samjna. * From this characteristic of samjna, it becomes clear that the samjna of food etc. as stated in the fourth chapter of the Stananga Sutra and the samjna of fear of food, attachment, sexual intercourse, anger, pride, delusion, greed, sorrow, happiness, sorrow, delusion, doubt, etc. are not intended here. * Overall, 'sanjeepa' inspires the soul to obtain knowledge-specific and quality-defect-evaluative samjna.

1965. Jiva, O Bhagavan! Are they Sanji, Asanji, or Nosanji-Noaprasanji? [1965 Q] Gautama! Jivas are both Sanji and Asanji, and also Nosanji-Noaprasanji. [1965 A]

1966.  Nairyika, O Bhagavan! Are they Sanji, Asanji, or Nosanji-Noaprasanji? [1966 Q] Gautama! Nairyikas are both Sanji and Asanji, but not Nosanji-Noaprasanji. [1966 A]

1967.  Similarly, from Asurakumara to Thanikumar. [1967]

1968.  Pruthvikaayika, O Bhagavan! Are they Sanji, Asanji, or Nosanji-Noaprasanji? [1968 Q] Gautama! Prithvikaayikas are not Sanji, nor Nosanji-Noaprasanji, but Asanji. [1968 A] (Similarly, one should understand about all the Ekendriya Jivas.)

1969.  Similarly, Beindriya, Teindriya, and Charidriya. [1969]

1970.  Manusa, like all Jivas (Su. 1665). [1970]

The meaning of Sanjna in this chapter is - the contemplation-consideration of the nature of past, future and present feelings / Those beings who have this kind of Sanjna are called Sanjni. That is, those who have a specific memory-like psychology. Beings who are विकल due to this kind of psychology (brain knowledge) are called Asanjni. Or, the one who has perfect knowledge of past, future and present matter is called Sanjna, that is - specific mental attitude. Those who have this kind of Sanjna are called Sanjni. That is - Samanask beings are Sanjni and those who do not have mental activity, such Amanask beings are called Asanjni. Those who are beyond both Sanjni and Asanjni categories are called Kevali or Siddha Nosanjni-Noasanjni. 'Who is Sanjni, who is Asanjni and who is Sanjni-Asanjni and why? Ekendriya, Vikalendriya and Sammuchhim Panchendriya beings are Asanjni, because Ekendriya lack mental activity and Dwiiendriyaadi Vikalendriya and Sammuchhim Panchendriya have the influence of specific mental attitude. Kevali, even though they are related to Manodravya, are devoid of Sanjna which is in the form of contemplation of the nature of past, future and present time matter or feelings, and due to the complete destruction of Jnanaavaran and Darshanavaran karmas, they know and see all matter directly through Kevalgyan-Kevaldarshan. Therefore, Kevali are neither Sanjni nor Asanjni, Siddhas are also not Sanjni, because they do not have Dravyaman and due to being Sarvagya, they are not Asanjni either / Therefore, Kevali and Siddha are called Nosanjni-Noasanjni. 1.

[176] The aggregate living beings are both *sanjñī* and *asanjñī*, and also *nosanjñī-noasanjñī*. The *nairāyika* and the ten types of *bhavanapati* gods are also both *sanjñī* and *asanjñī*. Those who are born in hell or among the *bhavanapati* gods from a *nairāyika* or *bhavanapati* *sanjñī* birth are called *nārak* or *bhavanapati* *sanjñī*. Those who are born in hell or among the *bhavanapati* gods from an *asanjñī* birth are called *asanjñī*. However, *nārak* or *bhavanapati* gods cannot be *nosanjñī-noasanjñī* because they cannot become *kevalī*. The reason they cannot become *kevalī* is that they cannot embrace *cāritra*. The state of consciousness of humans should be understood as similar to that of aggregate living beings. That is, humans are also *sanjñī*, *asanjñī*, and *nosanjñī-noasanjñī* like aggregate living beings.

This is the thirty-second chapter of the *Prajnapana Sutra*, named *Sanayata Pada*. *Sanayata Pada* is the most excellent stage of human life. Only after attaining *Sanayata Pada* can one ascend the ladder of liberation with increasing speed. The best worship of the three jewels, *Samyag Darshan*, *Samyag Gyan*, and *Samyak Charitra*, can be achieved only after attaining this stage. Therefore, it has been given a place in the thirty-second chapter of *Prajnapana*. *This chapter discusses the *Sanayata*, *Asanayata*, *Sanayata-Sanayata*, and *No-Sanayata-No-Asanayata* states of the twenty-four *Dandakavarti* beings, from the *Samuccaya* beings to the *Vaimanika* beings. The four aspects related to *Sanayata* have been considered for all beings. *Sanayata* means one who is a *Mahavrathi*, *Sanayami*, and *Sarva-Virat*. *Asanayata* means one who is completely *Avirat*, *Asanayami*, and *Apratyakhyani*. *Sanayata-Sanayata* means one who is *Desha-Virat*, *Shravakavati*, and *Virata-Avirat*. And *No-Sanayata-No-Asanayata-No-Sanayata-Sanayata* means one who is neither *Sanayata* nor *Asanayata*, nor *Sanayata-Sanayata*, because even *Sanayata* is a seeker, not yet a liberated soul, and *Sanayata-Sanayata* is even lower. Therefore, *No-Sanayata-No-Asanayata-No-Sanayata-Sanayata* refers to the liberated Lord. *The conclusion of this chapter is that *Naraka*, *Ekendriya*, *Tri-Vikalendriya*, *Bhavanapati*, *Vanavyantara*, *Jyotishka*, and *Vaimanika* are all *Asanayata*. They cannot be *Sanayata* or *Sanayata-Sanayata*. *Panchendriya-Tiryach* cannot be *Sanayata*, but can be *Sanayata-Sanayata*, or is often *Asanayata*. In humans, all three types, *Sanayata*, *Asanayata*, and *Sanayata-Sanayata*, are possible. Only the liberated Lord can be *No-Sanayata-No-Asanayata-No-Sanayata-Sanayata*. *Acharya Malayagiri, explaining the importance of *Sanayata Pada*, said that *Devas*, *Narakas*, and *Tiryach-Panchendriya* do not experience the results of *Sarva-Virati* type of *Charitra* or *Kevalgyan*. They cannot even listen, contemplate, or adopt *Charitra* in their lives. As a result, they experience regret and sorrow. Therefore, humans should strive to attain *Sanayata Pada*. *In the *Samyam Dwar* of the *Shatkhandagama*, *Samayik-Shuddhi-Sanayata*, *Chhedopasthapan-Shuddhi-Sanayata*, *Parihar-Shuddhi-Sanayata*, *Sookshma-Samparaya-Shuddhi-Sanayata*, *Yathakyata-Vihar-Shuddhi-Sanayata*, *Sanayata-Sanayata*, and *Asanayata* are distinguished, and the discussion is carried out through the fourteen *Gunasthanas*. 10 1. *Pannavanasuttam* Bha. 2.

[1977 Q.]  O Bhagavan! Are the Panchendriya-Tiryagyonikas Sanayata?  

[1977 A.]  Gautama! The Panchendriya-Tiryagyonikas are neither Sanayata nor No-Sanayata-No-Asanayata-No-Sanayata-Sanayata, but they are Asanayata or Sanayata-Sanayata.

Jivas are also unrestrained because Narakas, etc., are unrestrained. * Jivas are also restrained-unrestrained because Panchendriya Tiryanch and humans are the devotees of Desha-Samyama by abandoning gross Pranatipat, etc. And Jivas are also unrestrained-ununrestrained-unrestrained-restrained because the negation of these three is found in Siddhas.

[180] Restraint in the form of renunciation does not arise from the *Prajñāpanā Sūtra*.  Since there is no inclination in *sāvadhyoga*, there is no unrestraint either.  For the same reason, the combined form of restraint and unrestraint is not found in the Siddhas.  Who is restrained, who is unrestrained, who is both restrained and unrestrained, and who is neither restrained nor unrestrained nor both restrained and unrestrained?  The *mūlapāṭha* has already provided the model for this, and the final *sangrahaṇī gāthā* has given the conclusion.

## Thirty-third *Avadhi-pad*

This is the thirty-third *Avadhi-pad* of the *Prajnapana Sutra*. It contains a detailed discussion about *Avadhi-jnana*.  *Avadhi-jnana* is explained from various perspectives.

Indian philosophers and, in some cases, Western philosophers have discussed extrasensory perception in their respective religious scriptures and independently written literature. Ordinary people are amazed to hear about the past, future, and present from an astrologer, a person with knowledge of mantras, or a devotee of a deity. They consider it a miracle and blindly follow the wrong path. Sometimes people get caught up in such miracles and lose their wealth and religion.  Many people, blinded by the momentary brilliance of miracles, abandon their morals and stand at the crossroads of moral decline.

Therefore, what is such a miracle? Is it *Avadhi-jnana* or some other knowledge? To resolve this doubt, Jain Tirthankaras have explained the true nature of *Avadhi-jnana*. How many types are there? How does it arise? Does it disappear, increase or decrease, or remain permanent? Who possesses such knowledge? Is it present from birth or through specific *kshaya-upashama*? To provide real guidance to seekers and to prevent them from losing their path in pursuit of such knowledge, to prevent ordinary people from getting caught up in miracles and abandoning the practice of the *Ratnatraya* for other paths, and to dispel the illusion of miracles among the people, *Avadhi-jnana* has been explained from various perspectives.

This *pad* analyzes *Avadhi-jnana* through seven doors:

1. **First, the *Bhed-dwar*:** This explains the different types of *Avadhi-jnana*.
2. **Second, the *Vishay-dwar*:** This explains the subject matter illuminated by *Avadhi-jnana*.
3. **Third, the *Sansthan-dwar*:** This describes the size of the illuminated area.
4. **Fourth, the *Avadhi-jnana* *Bahya-Abhyantar* types:** This explains the external and internal types of *Avadhi-jnana*.
5. **Fifth, the *Desha-Avadhi-dwar*:** This explains the best, worst, and average types of *Avadhi-jnana*.
6. **Sixth, the *Dwar*:** This explains the decay and growth of *Avadhi-jnana*. It discusses *Avadhi-jnana* that is decreasing and increasing.
7. **Seventh, the *Dwar*:** This explains the permanent and temporary types of *Avadhi-jnana*.

The type of knowledge about the past, future, and present that ordinary people are impressed by and consider a miracle is just a special type of *mati-jnana*. It is not extrasensory perception. Many people consider *jati-smarana-jnana*, the knowledge of remembering past lives, to be a type of *Avadhi-jnana*, but it is just a special type of *mati-jnana*. 

Astrology or mantras...

The specific knowledge that arises from the Prajñāpanā Sūtra, Tantra, etc., or from the worship of deities, is not Avadhijñāna. It is a specific type of Matijñāna. The nature of Avadhijñāna is described in the Karma Grantha, etc., as the knowledge of material objects that occurs within the Avadhi-mārȳādā, without the help of the senses and mind. It is of two types, based on the distinction of Bhava-pratyaya and Guṇa-pratyaya (Kṣayopaśamika). Devas and Narakas have it from birth, while humans and Pañcendriya-tiryañcas acquire it through the Kṣayopaśam of their karmas. The essence of the discussion on the subject matter of Avadhijñāna is this: from the perspective of the Naraka realm, it knows and sees at least half a village and at most four villages. Then, one by one, the Avadhi-kṣetra of the Narakas of all seven Narakas is described. In the lower Naraka realms, the Avadhijñāna-kṣetra progressively decreases. In the Bhavanapati Nikāya, the Avadhi-kṣetra of the Asurakumāra is at least 25 yojanas and at most countless islands and seas. The Avadhi-kṣetra of the rest, like the Nāgakumāra, is countless islands and seas. The Avadhi-kṣetra of the Pañcendriya-tiryañcas is countless parts of an angula at the lowest and countless islands and seas at the highest. The highest Avadhi-kṣetra of humans is as much as countless Lokas, the size of a Loka, even in A-loka. The Avadhi-kṣetra of the Vāṇavyantara is like that of the Nāgakumāra. The lowest Avadhi-kṣetra of the Jyotiṣka-devas is countless islands and seas. In the discussion of the Avadhi-kṣetra of the Vaimānika Devas, the Avadhi-kṣetra below, above, and diagonally from the Vimāna is described. The Avadhi-kṣetra of those particular Vaimānika Devas on the Vimāna is detailed. The Avadhi-kṣetra of the Anuttaraupapātika Devas is the size of the entire Loka-nāḍī. The shape of Avadhijñāna is described as being of various types, like a Dōngī, Pallka, Bhālar, Pataha, etc., in relation to its field. Ācārya Malayagiri concluded that it is more extensive in the upper part for the Bhavanapati and Vyantara, in the lower part for the Vaimānikas, and in the horizontal direction for the Jyotiṣka and Narakas. The shape of Avadhijñāna for humans and Tiryañcas is peculiar. In the discussion of external and internal Avadhi, it is stated that the Naraka and Deva Avadhi-kṣetra are within, meaning their Avadhijñāna is spread around them. It is not like that for the Tiryañcas. The human Avadhi-kṣetra is both within and external. This means that if the spread of Avadhijñāna is from where it is itself, then it is considered internal (antaḥ), but if the spread of Avadhi is in a separate region from itself, then it is considered external to Avadhi. Only humans are capable of Sarv-avadhi, while all other beings have only Deśa-avadhi. In the later chapters, the types of Avadhi, such as Prānu-gāmika-anānu-gāmika, Hīyamāna-vardhamāna, Pratipāti-apratipāti, and Avasthita-anavasthita, etc., are described for Naraka, etc., beings. Overall, a comprehensive discussion of Avadhijñāna is presented in this chapter. Even the Bhagavati Sūtra and Karma Grantha do not have such a detailed discussion.

## Translation:

**[184] The cessation of the *vedana* (feeling) as per the *Prajñapana Sutra* is called *kṣaya* (destruction), and the removal or postponement of the *vipaka-udaya* (fruition of karma) of one who has not attained the state of *udaya* (arising) is called *upasama* (submergence). The *avadhi-jñāna* (clairvoyance) whose main cause is *kṣaya-upasama* is called *kṣaya-upasama-pratyaya* or *kṣaya-upasamik avadhi-jñāna*.**

**Who has which *avadhi-jñāna* and why? - *Bhava-pratyayik avadhi-jñāna* is experienced by the gods of all four castes and by the inhabitants of the seven hells, such as *Ratna-prabha*. The question arises that *avadhi-jñāna* is in the state of *kṣaya-upasamik* and the inhabitants of hell, etc., are in the state of *bhava-proudayik* (arising of existence). How can the gods and the inhabitants of hell have *avadhi-jñāna* in such a situation? The solution is that in reality, *bhava-pratyayik avadhi-jñāna* is also *kṣaya-upasamik*, but that *kṣaya-upasama* is inevitable when the cause of the state of godhood or hell is obtained. For example, the ability to fly in the sky is inevitably obtained in the state of being a bird. Similarly, upon obtaining the cause of godhood or hell, the gods and the inhabitants of hell inevitably obtain *avadhi-jñāna*.**

**The *avadhi-jñāna* of two types of beings is *kṣaya-upasamik*, i.e., caused by *kṣaya-upasama*, namely humans and five-sensed animals. For these two, *avadhi-jñāna* is not inevitable, because they do not obtain *avadhi-jñāna* from the cause of human existence or animal existence. Rather, only those humans or five-sensed animals who have experienced the *kṣaya-upasama* of their *avadhi-jñāna-āvaraniya karma* (karma that obstructs clairvoyance) obtain *avadhi-jñāna*, otherwise not. This is also called *guṇa-pratyaya* in the language of the *karma* scriptures.**

**Although both types of *avadhi-jñāna* mentioned above are *kṣaya-upasamik*, there is a difference between them due to the difference in the cause mentioned above.**

**Second: The scope of *avadhi* (clairvoyance)**

**1983. "O Venerable One! How much territory do the inhabitants of hell perceive with *avadhi* (clairvoyance)?" "Gautama! They perceive, with *avadhi* (clairvoyance), from the lowest *prādhā gāū* (territory) to the highest four *gāū* (territories).**

**1984. "O Venerable One! How much territory do the inhabitants of the *Ratna-prabha-pṛthvī* (hell) perceive with *avadhi* (clairvoyance)?" "Gautama! They perceive, with *avadhi* (clairvoyance), from the lowest three and a half *gāū* to the highest four *gāū* (territories).**

**Thirty-three types of Avadhi knowledge [2] and their forms up to Acyutadeva. [2014-2] In the same way, one should understand the form of Avadhi knowledge up to Acyutadeva. 2015. What is the form of Avadhi knowledge of Graiveyakadeva? [2015 Q] Gautama! It is like a flower basket. [2015 A] 2016. What is the form of Avadhi knowledge of Anuttaroupapatikdeva? [2016 Q] Gautama! Their Avadhi knowledge is said to be like a Yavanalika. [2016 A]  Discussion: The various forms of Avadhi knowledge of beings - Narakas have a Taprakar form, Bhavanapatideva have a Pallakakar form, Panchendriya Tiryanchas and humans have various forms, Vyantardeva have a Pathakar form, Jyotishkadeva have a Jhallar form, Devas from Saudharmakalpa to Acyutakalpa have an Urdhva Mridangakar form, Graiveyakdeva have a Pushpachangeri form, and Anuttaroupapatikdeva have a Yavanalika form of Avadhi knowledge.  In reality, the form of the illuminated area by Avadhi knowledge is called the form of Avadhi by convention.  Meaning of difficult words: Tapra - a long and triangular piece of wood brought from afar, or a long and triangular boat, flowing in the current of a river. Pallak - a special vessel used to fill rice in Ladhdesh, which is long at the top and bottom, slightly constricted at the top, and shaped like a chest. Patha - a drum (a type of musical instrument), Jhallari - a Jhallar, a type of musical instrument, which is round, it is also called a Dhapli. Urdhva-Madang - a Mridang raised upwards, which is wide at the bottom and narrow at the top. Pushpachangeri - a flower basket, a basket with a flower crown woven from thread. Changeri is also called a basket or a tokri. Yavanalika - a girl's bodice.  The implication of the form of Avadhi knowledge is that the Avadhi knowledge of Bhavanapatis and Vanavyantardeva is more towards the top, and that of Vaimanikas is more towards the bottom. That of Jyotishkas and Narakas is oblique, and that of humans and Tiryanchas is of various types.  The Avadhi knowledge of Panchendriya Tiryanchas and humans is like the various forms of fish in the Svayambhuramanasamudra, so it is of various forms in Tiryancha Panchendriyas and humans. It is also circular.**

**Discussion of Prābyantara-avadhi and Bāhyāvadhi:**

**Nature and Explanation:**

The avadhijnān which illuminates its own field of manifestation in all beings is called prābyantara-avadhi. The avadhijnānī who resides within the illuminated field is also called prābyantara-avadhi. The opposite of this is called bāhyāvadhi.

**Bāhyāvadhi** is of two types: **Antargata** and **Madhyagata**.

**Antargata** is that which is located within the **ātma-pradeśa** (the region of the soul). It is located in the **paryanta** (the boundary) of the **ātma-pradeśa**.

When avadhijnān arises, it arises as a **spardhaka**. A **spardhaka** is like the light of a lamp that shines out through a window lattice, a specific form of **niyatavicchedha** (definite separation).

These **spardhaka** are numerous and varied in a being. The **paryantavarti** (boundary-reaching) **spardhaka** arises in the **ātma-pradeśa** in front, behind, below, or above, and becomes located in the **paryanta** of the **ātma**. This is why it is called **antargata**.

Alternatively, the **antargata** is that which is located in the **audārika śarīra** (the physical body). It is called **antargata** because it knows the **audārika śarīra** in a particular direction.

Or, even after **kṣayopśama** (cessation of karmic afflictions) in all **ātma-pradeśa**, the avadhijnān that is known in a particular direction of the **audārika śarīra** is called **antargata**.

**Antargata** is of three types: (1) **Puraḥ** (front), (2) **Pṛṣṭhaḥ** (back), (3) **Pārvaḥ** (side).

**Madhyagata** is that which is located in the **ātma-pradeśa**.

## Thirty-third Chapter: The Middle Position

[193] The term "middle-position" (madhyagat) refers to a state where the awareness of the self (atmapradesha) is in the middle, or where the knowledge of all the self-regions is extinguished, and the awareness is still perceived through the middle part of the audaric body. In essence, when the field illuminated by the knowledge of the self (avdhijnana) is connected to the knower of the self (avdhijnani), it is called "inner-avdhi" (prabhyantar-avdhi). When the field illuminated by the knowledge of the self is not connected to the knower of the self, it is called "outer-avdhi" (bahyavdhi).

Narkas (hell beings) and all types of Devas (gods) due to their inherent nature (bhavasvabhava) remain only in the inner-middle of the knowledge of the self (avdhijnana), not in the outer. Their knowledge of the self illuminates the field in all directions, therefore they are in the middle of the avdhi.

Panchendriya-tiryanch (five-sensed animals) and other beings due to their inherent nature are not within the avdhi, but outside. Their avdhi is like a spark that illuminates intermittently. Humans are both in the middle and outside of the avdhi.

## Question and Answer

**2022.** "Venerable Sir, is the avdhijnana of Narkas (hell beings) desavdhi (limited to a specific region) or sarvavdhi (all-encompassing)?"

**2022.** "Gautama, their avdhijnana is desavdhi, not sarvavdhi."

**2023.** "The same applies to the Thanikumaras (a type of celestial being)."

**2024.** "Venerable Sir, is the avdhi of Panchendriya-tiryanch (five-sensed animals) desavdhi or sarvavdhi?"

**2024.** "Gautama, it is desavdhi, not sarvavdhi."

**2025.** "Venerable Sir, is the avdhijnana of humans desavdhi or sarvavdhi?"

**2025.** "Gautama, their avdhijnana is both desavdhi and sarvavdhi."

**2026.** "The avdhi of Vanamantar (celestial beings), Jyotishk (astronomers), and Vamania (celestial beings) is like that of Narkas (hell beings) (as mentioned in Sutra 2022)."

## Analysis: Desavdhi and Sarvavdhi

The knowledge of the self (avdhijnana) is of three types: the lowest, the middle, and the highest. The lowest and the middle avdhi are called desavdhi.

194] The *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* and the most excellent *avadhi* are called *paramāvadhi* or *sarvāvadhi*. The *sarvajghanya* *avadhi* knowledge knows the *taijasavargāṇa* and *bhāṣāvargāṇa* substances, which are intermediate between the *apāntarālavartī* substances, with respect to substance; it knows an immeasurable part of an inch with respect to space; and it knows an immeasurable part of the past and future time with respect to time. Although it knows the substances that are the objects of *avadhi* knowledge, it cannot directly perceive space and time because they are abstract and formless. However, it knows the substances that are form-bearing in space and time by way of convention, and it knows an infinite number of *paryāyas* by way of feeling. Since substances are infinite, it knows at least four *paryāyas* of each substance, namely, form, taste, smell, and touch. This is the *sarvajghanya* *avadhi* knowledge. Beyond this, *avadhi* knowledge that increases with the increase of space, time, and *paryāyas* is called *madhyama*. Until the most excellent *avadhi* knowledge is attained, one should understand it as *madhyama*. The most excellent *avadhi* knowledge knows all form-bearing substances with respect to substance; it knows the entire *loka* and immeasurable sections of the *aloka* that are equal to the *loka* with respect to space; it knows immeasurable past and future *utsapiṇīs* and *avasapiṇīs* with respect to time; and it knows an infinite number of *paryāyas* with respect to feeling, because it knows the countable and immeasurable *paryāyas* of each substance.

In other words, the being in which this Avadhi-jnana manifests, sees the area around that place up to countless Yojanas, in the same way, even after that being moves to another place, it knows and sees that much area, it is called Pranu-gaamik. (2) Ana-nu-gaamik (Ananu-gaami)-which does not move along, but stays in the place where Avadhi-jnana originated, knowing the objects, not knowing after leaving the place of origin, is called Ana-nu-gaamik. The meaning is that Avadhi-jnana staying in its own place is called Ana-nu-gaamik. (3) Vardhaman -which Avadhi-jnana is of less subject at the time of origination and due to the increasing study with the purity of the result, becomes more and more subject, taking the limits of substance, field, time and feeling, is called 'Vardhaman'. (4) Hoyaman-~which Avadhi-jnana, even though it is of more subject at the time of origination, due to the impurity of the results, gradually becomes less, less and least subject, is called Hoyaman  /  (5) Pratipaati Its meaning is to fall, decline or end  /  Like a bright lamp suddenly extinguishing due to a gust of wind, the Avadhi-jnana which suddenly disappears is called Pratipaati  /  This Avadhi-jnana can originate and disappear at any moment of life  /  (6) Apratipaati-the Avadhi-jnana whose nature is not prone to fall, is called Apratipaati  /  Even after attaining Keval-jnana, Apratipaati Avadhi-jnana does not go away, because there is no rise of Avadhi-jnana-avarana, due to which it would go away; rather, it gets absorbed in Keval-jnana  /  Its existence is Akichitkara in front of Keval-jnana. Like the light of a lamp in front of the sun. This Apratipaati Avadhi-jnana happens in the last time of the beings of the twelfth Gunasthan and after that, with the first time of attaining the thirteenth Gunasthan, Keval-jnana originates. This Apratipaati Avadhi-jnana is also called Parama-avadhi-jnana  /  The difference between Hiyaman and Pratipaati is that Hiyaman gradually decreases compared to before, while Pratipaati, like a lamp, is destroyed in a single moment  /  (7) Avashit-which Avadhi-jnana stays in the soul even after rebirth or stays until the origination of Keval-jnana, is called Avashit Avadhi-jnana. (8) Ana-vashit Like the wave of water, which Avadhi-jnana sometimes decreases, sometimes increases, sometimes becomes manifest and sometimes disappears

[196] [The Prajñapanasutra is called Anvasthita. These two distinctions are similar in characteristics to Pratipati and Apratipati, but they are considered relatively separate because of the difference in name only.] The conclusion is that the knowledge of the Narakas and the four types of Devas is Anugamika, Apratipati, and Avashthita.

34th Paricārṇāpada (Primary * Prājñāpanāsūtra)

This is the 34th Paricārṇāpada. In some copies, the word 'Pravicārṇā' is found, which is the root of the word 'Pravīcāra' in the 'Tattvārthasūtra'. Therefore, Paricārṇā and Pravīcāra are synonymous. * The word 'Paricāra' is also found in the Kaṭhopaniṣad. * Pravīcāra or Paricārṇā both mean sexual intercourse, sensual enjoyment, erotic play, passion, indulgence in sensual pleasures, etc.

Indian spiritual aspirants, especially the Jain Tīrthaṅkaras, have not given as much importance to the devas as to human beings. The devas are certainly ahead of humans in terms of sensual pleasures and worldly enjoyments, and are skilled in assuming any desired form, but the human birth is considered the highest, because liberation from the objects of senses and passions is possible only in the human birth, in the human form. Bhagavān Mahāvīra has repeatedly emphasized the rarity of the human birth by saying 'Māṇuṣaṃ khu dullabhaṃ'. This is why the superiority of the sensual enjoyments of the devas in the nine Graiveyaka and five Anuttaravimāna realms, as well as other devas, is clearly expounded to highlight the importance of the human life. Except for the highest-class Vaimānika devas, other devas cannot renounce the sensual enjoyments of the senses.

Although the highest-class Vaimānika devas are free from Paricārṇā and Devī, they cannot be called celibate, as they do not have the results of character. Whereas in the human life, one can become a complete celibate or a limited celibate by becoming a Mahāvratī-Sarvavirati-sādhaka.

This pada expounds the various aspects of the Paricārṇā of the devas. Although the initial statement is related to food, upon deeper examination, it becomes clear that the statement about food is relevant here, as the basis of Paricārṇā or sexual intercourse is the body, and the related touch, form, sound, mind, limbs, senses, physical beauty, grace, agility, or complexion, etc.

Page #1393:
---------------------------
[198] This section begins with the process of body formation as described in the Prajñāpanā Sūtra. At the time of their first birth, the twenty-four Dandaka-bodied beings begin to take *āhāra* (food). Subsequently, their bodies develop. The *yudgala* (atoms) are absorbed from all sides, transforming into the body, senses, etc. When the senses are nourished by *āhāra*, they become stimulated, and the being engages in *paricāraṇā* (activity), followed by *vikriyā* (reaction). In Devas, *vikriyā* comes first, followed by *paricāraṇā*. In *ekendriya* (one-sensed) and *vikaleindriya* (impaired-sensed) beings, there is *paricāraṇā* but no *vikriyā*. In *paricāraṇā*, the being begins to consume all objects, including sound, etc. 

*After discussing *āhāra*, the text mentions *ābhōganirvṛttita* and *anābhōganirvṛttita* *āhāra*. The commentator explains that *ābhōganirvṛttita* refers to "taking food with mental intention" (*manōpraṇidhāna pūrvakam āhāram gṛhṇanti*), meaning taking food with mindfulness. *Anābhōganirvṛttita* *āhāra* is the opposite, referring to food taken without mindfulness. For example, *ekendriya* beings are not adept at acquiring mental wealth (*manōdravya labdhi*), so they do not have *ābhōga* (mindfulness) in their consumption. However, since beings with the sense of taste have a mouth, they have a desire to eat, so *ekendriya* beings are considered to have *anābhōganirvṛttita* *āhāra*. Except for *ekendriya* beings, all other beings take both *ābhōganirvṛttita* and *anābhōganirvṛttita* *āhāra*.

*The text then discusses which beings are aware of and perceive the ingested *āhārya pudgala* (food atoms) and which are not. According to the saying "āhārasuddhau sattvasuddhiḥ" (purity of food leads to purity of the soul), the text discusses the *adhyavasaya sthāna* (places of determination) after *āhāra* because of the connection between food and determination. There are countless types of *adhyavasaya sthāna* in the twenty-four Dandakas, both *praśasta* (excellent) and *apraśasta* (inferior). *Sthitibandha* (state-binding) and *anubhāgabandha* (part-binding) are closely related to *paricāraṇā*. This is why the Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama extensively discusses the *adhyavasaya sthāna* of *karma* (action) in relation to *sthitibandha* and *anubhāgabandha*.

*The text then discusses *samyaktva ābhigāmi* (those who are on the path of right faith), *mithyātva ābhigāmi* (those who are on the path of wrong faith), and *samyag-mithyātva ābhigāmi* (those who are on the path of both right and wrong faith) in the twenty-four Dandakas. This discussion in the context of *paricāraṇā* suggests that *samyaktva* and *mithyātva* have distinct effects on the results of *paricāraṇā*. The *paricāraṇā* performed by a *samyaktva* being and the *paricāraṇā* performed by a *mithyātva* being will have a night-and-day difference, and accordingly, there will be a difference in *karmabandha* (karma-binding).

*Up to this point, the five *dvāra* (gates) have been presented as the background for *paricāraṇā*. 1. *Paṇāvaṇā Sutta* (Introduction) Bha. 2, p. 145 2.

Primary [199 (1) Anantarāhāradwāra, (2) Āhārābhogadwāra, (3) Pudgalajñānadwāra, (4) Adhyavasānadwāra and (5) Samyaktvaābhigamadwāra / After this, the sixth Paricāraṇādwāra begins / The author has expounded Paricāraṇā from four aspects - (1) With respect to devas, there are three possible options, the fourth option is not possible: (I) Sadevīka Saparicāra devas, (II) Adevīka Saparicāra devas, (III) Adevīka Aparicāra devas / It is not possible for any deva to be both Sadevīka and Aparicāra. Thus, the above three possible options are explained as follows: (1) In Bhavanapati, Vāṇavyantara, Jyotiṣka and Saudharmīśāna Vaimānika, there are devīs. Therefore, there is Kāyikaparicāraṇa (sexual intercourse with devas and devīs) in them. (2) From Sanaṭkumārakalpa to Acyutakalpa, the Vaimānika devas have only devas, not devīs. Therefore, the second option is - in those vimānas, there are no devīs, yet Paricāraṇā occurs. (3) However, in the nine Graiveyakas and Anuttaravimānas, there are neither devīs nor Paricāraṇā by the devas there. This is the third option. * How does Paricāraṇā occur in the devalokas where there are no devīs? Resolving this, the author says: (1) In Sanaṭkumāra and Māhendrakalpa, there is Sparśaparicāraṇā, (2) In Brahmaloka and Lāntakakalpa, there is Rūpaparicāraṇā, (3) In Mahāśukra and Sahasrārakalpa, there is Śabdaparicāraṇā, (4) In Pānata-Prāṇata and Prāraṇa-Acyutakalpa, there is Manḥparicāraṇā. * Kāyaparicāraṇā occurs when the devas have a spontaneous desire in the mind, i.e., the desire for Kāyaparicāraṇā. And then the devīs-Apsarās appear in charming and delightful forms and in Vaikriya bodies. * The Kāyika-Paricāraṇā of the devas with the devīs is similar to the Kāyika sexual intercourse of humans. The author further stated that the devas have Śukra-pudgalas, which migrate into those devīs and become Pañcendriya forms, and they also enhance the beauty and grace of the Apsarās. * Here, a special thing to note is that there is no conception from that Śukra of the deva in the Apsarā, because the devas have Vaikriya bodies. Their birth is not from the womb, but Aupapātika. * Where Sparśa, Rūpa and Śabda Paricāraṇā occurs, there are no devīs. But when the devas have the desire for Spādi-Paricāraṇā, the Apsarās (devīs) manifest themselves through Vikrīyā. They go up to the Sahasrārakalpa, which is particularly noteworthy. Then the devas experience satisfaction and fulfillment successively (as appropriate) from Sparśādi alone. This is their Paricāraṇā: The devas who perform Sparśādi Paricāraṇā also have Śukra-visarjana.

Page #1395:
---------------------------
[200] The *Prajñāpanā Sūtra Vṛttikāra* has explained that even though there is no physical contact between the gods and goddesses, due to divine influence, there is a transfer of *śukra* (semen) in the goddesses, and this results in an increase in their beauty. In *Prānat*, *Prāṇat*, *Pāraṇ* and *Acyutakalpa*, there is only mental service (service with the mind). Therefore, when the gods desire to serve those particular goddesses, the goddesses are not present there, but they remain in their own places and adorn themselves beautifully, creating a charming appearance. The gods, while remaining in their own places, achieve mental satisfaction, and at the same time, those goddesses, remaining in their own places, become increasingly beautiful due to divine influence.

*The last seventh gate of the present verse examines the small number of gods from the perspective of all the aforementioned types of service. In it, the decreasing number is as follows: (1) The fewest are the gods who do not serve, (2) the number of gods who serve with their minds is many times greater than them, (3) the number of gods who serve with words is countless times greater than them, (4) the number of gods who serve with form is countless times greater than them, (5) the number of gods who serve with touch is countless times greater than them, and (6) the number of gods who serve with the body is countless times greater than all of them. This increasing progression is presented in reverse order from the perspective of the increasing happiness in service. For example, the least happiness is in bodily service, and then there is an increasing happiness in service with touch, form, words, and mind. The greatest happiness is in the gods who do not serve. The *Vṛttikāra* has revealed this secret.*

## The Thirty-Fourth Chapter: The Nature of the Thirty-Fourth Chapter

**2032.** The Thirty-Fourth Chapter's meaning is as follows: (1) The nature of the *anantara-āhara* (immediate food), (2) the consumption of food, (3) the inability of *pudgalas* to know, (4) *adhyavasāna* (determination), (5) the attainment of *samyaktva* (right faith), (6) the *pariyāraṇa* (care) related to the body, touch, form, sound, and mind, and (7) the scarcity of those who practice *pariyāraṇa* related to the body, etc.

**223-224.** (1) The *anantara-āhara* is the immediate food, (2) the consumption of food is the act of eating, (3) *pudgalas* are not aware, (4) *adhyavasāna* is the determination, (5) the attainment of *samyaktva* is the achievement of right faith, (6) *pariyāraṇa* is the care related to the body, touch, form, sound, and mind, and (7) the scarcity of those who practice *pariyāraṇa* related to the body, etc.

**Discussion:** The Thirty-Fourth Chapter discusses the following topics through two *sangrahaṇī-gāthās*: (1) The nature of the *anantara-āhara* for hell beings, etc., (2) Whether their consumption of food is *ābhōgajanita* (arising from consumption) or *anābhōgajanita* (not arising from consumption), (3) Whether hell beings, etc., are aware of the *pudgalas* they consume as food, (4) The *adhyavasāna* of hell beings, etc., (5) The attainment of *samyaktva* by hell beings, etc., (6) The discussion of the objects of perception, such as sound, etc., and the *pariyāraṇa* related to the body, touch, form, sound, and mind, (7) The scarcity of those who practice *pariyāraṇa* related to the body, etc.

**2033.** "Venerable Sir, are hell beings *anantara-āhara* (immediate food)? After that, is there the *nivṛttaṇa* (emergence) of their body? Then, is there the *pariyādāna* (receiving)? Then, is there the *pariṇāmana* (transformation)? Then, is there the *pariyāraṇa* (care)? And then, is there the *viuvṛttaṇa* (disintegration)?"

"Yes, my dear, hell beings are *anantara-āhara* (immediate food). After that, there is the *nivṛttaṇa* (emergence) of their body. Then, there is the *pariyādāna* (receiving). Then, there is the *pariṇāmana* (transformation). Then, there is the *pariyāraṇa* (care). And then, there is the *viuvṛttaṇa* (disintegration)."

The thirty-fourth **Paricharanapada** [203 Discussion - From Anantarahara to Vikurvana, a discussion of the order of the twenty-four **Dandakavarti** beings like Naraka, etc. - In the first gate, the order of Anantarahara, Nishpatti, Paryadanata, Parinamana, Paricharana, and Vikurvana has been discussed in relation to the twenty-four **Dandakavarti** beings like Naraka, etc. / The special meaning of Anantarahara, etc. - Anantarahara - those who eat as soon as they enter the field of origin / Nirvartana - the origin of the body, Paryadanata - the intake of **Pudgala** that is food / Parinamana - the transformation of the taken **Pudgala** into the form of the body, senses, etc. / Paricharana - the enjoyment of objects like words, etc. as per their suitability / Vikurvana - reacting with the power of **Vaikriyalabdhi**. The question is whether Naraka, etc. are Anantarahara? In other words, do they eat immediately upon reaching the field of origin without any delay? After that, does their body undergo Nirvartana - origin (creation)? After the origin of the body, do they take in **Pudgala** through **Lomaahara**, etc. with their limbs? Then, do those taken **Pudgala** transform into the form of the body, senses, etc.? After the transformation, when the senses are strengthened, do they perform Paricharana? In other words, do they enjoy objects like words, etc. as per their suitability? And then, do they react with the power of their **Vaikriyalabdhi**? 2 Summary of the answer - The Lord has answered this sequential process with 'yes'. But except for **Vayukaayika**, the rest of the **Ekendirya** and **Vikalendirya** do not perform Vikurvana, because they cannot attain **Vaikriyalabdhi** / The second special point is that in the four types of Devas - **Bhavanapati**, **Vanavyantara**, **Jyotishka**, and **Vaimanika**, Vikurvana happens first and Paricharana happens later, while in the rest of the beings like Naraka, etc., the order is Paricharana followed by Vikurvana. The nature of the Devas is such that when they desire to enjoy specific words, etc., they first create the desired **Vaikriya** form and then enjoy the words, etc., but the beings like **Nairyika**, etc. react due to excessive joy upon receiving the enjoyment of words, etc., because of their desire to enjoy the most specific words, etc. Therefore, in the case of Devas, Vikurvana is mentioned first and Paricharana later.

Discussion - The nature of ābhoga-nirvartita and anābhoga-nirvartita - Although the two types of food have been discussed in the Āhāra-pada (28th pada) and this discussion about food should have been in the same pada, but the discussion of ābhoga-anābhoga-nirvartita has been done to explain the process before the paricāraṇā. The Vāttikāra Ācārya Malayagiri has called the food taken with manas-praṇidhāna as ābhoga-nirvartita. Therefore, when the Nārakas etc. take food with full concentration, then it is ābhoga-nirvartita, and when they take food without full concentration, then they take anābhoga-nirvartita food, i.e. lomāhāra. The ekaindriya jīvas have very little and dull manodravya-labdhi, therefore, due to the lack of full concentration, their food is not ābhoga-nirvartita. ' Tṛtīya Pudgalajñāna-dvāra 2040.

##  **Translation:**

**[Prajnapana Sutra Discussion - Twenty-four Categories of Beings]**

This discussion focuses on the **pudgalas** (matter particles) that are ingested by the twenty-four categories of beings.  A table is provided below for easy understanding:

**1. Nairyaika, Bhavanapati, Vanavyantara, Jyotishka, Ekaindriya, Dwindriya, Triindriya:**

* **Do not know, do not see, ingest.**

**2. Chaturindriya Beings:**

* **(1) Many know, see, and ingest.**
* **(2) Many know, do not see, but ingest.**

**3. Panchendriya Tiryancha, Manushya:**

* **(1) Many know, see, and ingest.**
* **(2) Many know, do not see, but ingest.**
* **(3) Many do not know, but see and ingest.**
* **(4) Do not see, do not know, but ingest.**

**4. Vaimanika Devas:**

* **(1) Many know, see, and ingest.**
* **(2) Many do not know, do not see, but ingest.**

**Explanation:**

Nairyaika, Bhavanapati Devas, and Ekaindriya beings, etc., do not know the pudgalas they ingest because their **lomahar** (ingestion of subtle matter) is extremely subtle and beyond their knowledge. They also do not see them because they are not within the scope of their **darshan** (perception). Due to their ignorance, Dwindriya beings lack **samyaggyan** (right knowledge) and therefore do not know or see these pudgalas. Their **mati-agyan** (mental ignorance) is so profound that they do not even know the **prakshepahar** (ingestion of gross matter) they consume.  They also cannot see these pudgalas due to the absence of the **chakshurindriya** (eye sense).

There are two categories of Chaturindriya beings:

* Some Chaturindriya beings do not know the ingested pudgalas but can see them because they possess the **chakshurindriya** (eye sense) and ingest them.
* Some Chaturindriya beings have eyes but cannot see due to darkness, so they do not see but still ingest.

In the case of Panchendriya Tiryancha and Manushya, there are four categories regarding the knowledge and perception of ingested pudgalas.

## Thirty-fourth Paricharana Pada [207]

**From the perspective of Prakshepaahar, there are four types of consumption:**

**(1) Some know, see, and consume.** Panchendriya Tiryanch and humans are Prakshepaahari, so those who are Samyagjnani, being knowers of the true nature of things, know Prakshepaahar due to their knowledge and also see and consume due to their Chakshusindriya. This is the first type.

**(2) Some know, but do not see and consume.** Some, being Samyagjnani, know, but due to darkness or other reasons, their eyes do not function, so they cannot see. This is the second type.

**(3) Some do not know, but see and consume.** Some, being Mithyagjnani, do not know because they do not have Samyagjnana, but they see due to the use of their Chakshusindriya. This is the third type.

**(4) Some do not know, do not see, but consume.** Some, being Mithyagjnani, do not know and due to darkness, their eyes are impaired, so they do not see, but they consume. This is the fourth type.

**From the perspective of Lomaahar, there are four types of consumption:**

**(1) Some Tiryanch Panchendriya and humans, due to their specific Avadhijnana, know Lomaahar and due to their specific Kshayopa-shama, their Indriyapatuta is very pure, so they see and consume.**

**(2) Some know, but due to lack of Indriyapatuta, they do not see.**

**(3) Some do not know, but due to Indriyapatuta, they see.**

**(4) Some, being Mithyagjnani, due to lack of Avadhijnana, do not know and due to lack of Indriyapatuta, they do not see, but they consume.**

**Among Vaimanikas, there are two types of consumption:**

**(1) Some do not know, do not see, but consume.** Those who are Mayo-Mithyadristi-Uppaanak, found up to the nine Greveyak Devas, do not know the Pudgalas suitable for Manomaya Aahar due to their Avadhijnana, because their Vibhangjnana is not capable of knowing those Pudgalas and due to lack of Indriyapatuta, they cannot see with their Chakshusindriya.

**(2) Those Vaimanik Devas who are Amaayi-Samyagdristi-Uppaanak, are also of two types - Anantaropappannak and Paramparopappannak.** These can also be called Prathamasamyo-tpanna and Aprathamasamyo-tpanna respectively. Anantaropappannak do not know and do not see because, being born in the first time, their Avadhijnana and Chakshusindriya are not used. Among Paramparopappannak, those who are Aparyapt, do not know and do not see because, due to the incompleteness of Paryaptis, their Avadhijnana, etc., cannot be used. Among Paryaptakas, those who are Anupa-yogavan, do not know and do not see. Those who use it, they are the ones who know, see, and consume the Pudgalas suitable for Vaimanik Aahar.

The five Anuttaravimanavasi Devas are Amaayi-Samyagdristi-Uppaanak and their Kshayas like anger, etc., are very mild, or they are Upashantakshayayi, so they are also Amaayi.

It should be known. The special thing is that the Ekendriya and Vikalendriya are only Mithyatvabhigami, they are neither Samyaktvabhigami nor Samyagmithyatvabhigami. Discussion - The intention of the Panchama-dvara - In this dvara, the question is whether the Narakas, etc., the twenty-four Dandakas, are Samyaktvabhigami (those who have attained Samyagdarshan), Mithyatvabhigami (those who have attained Mithyadrishti), or Samyagmithyatvabhigami (those who have attained mixed vision). Why are the Ekendriya only Mithyabhigami? - The Ekendriya jivas do not have Samyagdarshan, therefore they are only Mithyadrishti. Some Vikalendriya have the Samyaktv of Savadan, but it is short-lived, so it is not intended here, because they are only inclined towards Mithyatva. 1. (a) Prajnapana.

[210] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra - Gotama! In the Bhavanapati, Vāṇavyantara, Jyotiṣka and Saudharma-Īśāna kalpas, the gods are Kāya-paricārakas. In the Sanatkumāra and Mahendra kalpas, the gods are Sparśa-paricārakas. In the Brahmaloka and Kakalpa kalpas, the gods are Rūpa-paricārakas. In the Mahāśukra and Sahasrāra kalpas, the gods are Śabda-paricārakas. In the Prāṇat, Pāṇat, Pāraṇ and Acyuta kalpas, the gods are Manaḥ-paricārakas. The nine Greveyaka and five Anuttaraupapātika gods are Aparicārakas.  Therefore, Gotama! It is said that the gods of the Ānat and other kalpas are Manaḥ-paricārakas. [2052-1 Pr.] Bhagavan! How many types of Paricāraṇā are there? [2052-1 U.] Gotama! There are five types of Paricāraṇā. They are (1) Kāya-paricāraṇā, (2) Sparśa-paricāraṇā, (3) Rūpa-paricāraṇā, (4) Śabda-paricāraṇā and (5) Manaḥ-paricāraṇā. Pr.) Bhagavan! Why is it said that there are five types of Paricāraṇā, such as Kāya-paricāraṇā and Manaḥ-paricāraṇā? [U.] Gotama! The gods of the Bhavanapati, Vāṇavyantara, Jyotiṣka and Saudharma-Īśāna kalpas are Kāya-paricārakas. The gods of the Sanatkumāra and Mahendra kalpas are Sparśa-paricārakas. The gods of the Brahmaloka and Kakalpa kalpas are Rūpa-paricārakas. The gods of the Mahāśukra and Sahasrāra kalpas are Śabda-paricārakas. The gods of the Grāṇat, Prāṇat, Pāraṇ and Acyuta kalpas are Manaḥ-paricārakas. The nine Greveyaka and five Anuttaraupapātika gods are Aparicārakas.  Therefore, Gotama! It is said that the gods of the Ānat and other kalpas are Manaḥ-paricārakas.  [2] Now, those gods who are Kāya-paricārakas, when they desire, they think, "We want to perform Kāya-paricāraṇā with these Apsarās." Then, those gods, with that thought in mind, immediately see beautiful, charming, attractive, delightful, pleasing, and radiant Apsarās. When they see them, those gods feel a desire to perform Kāya-paricāraṇā with those Apsarās. Just as a person who is hungry wants to eat, or a person who is thirsty wants to drink, in the same way, those gods, with that thought in mind, immediately feel a desire to perform Kāya-paricāraṇā with those Apsarās.  Is it true, Bhante, that those gods have beautiful bodies? Yes, it is true. Bhante, what are the qualities of those Apsarās? Gotama! They have the qualities of beauty, good eyesight, good smell, good taste, good touch, loveliness, attractiveness, charm, grace, auspiciousness, beauty, youthfulness, and good qualities. They possess all these qualities. 1. 'Kāya-pravīcārā ā aiśānāt  / ' 'Śeṣāḥ sparśa-rūpa-śabda-mamaḥpravīcārā dvayo yoḥ.' -Tattvārtha, a.4, mṛ. 8-9

Sautisavana Parichayanapada (211 - [2052-2]) Among them, the Kaya-parichayaka (sensual pleasure-enjoying) devas, a desire arises in their minds that we want to engage in sexual intercourse with the bodies of the Apsaras. When the devas think so in their minds, the Apsaras create enchanting, captivating, and delightful Uttaravaikriya forms adorned with generous ornaments. Having created this transformation, they approach those devas. Then those devas engage in bodily intercourse with those Apsaras. Just as cold pudgala beings attain an extremely cold state by obtaining a cold-wombed being, or hot pudgala beings attain an extremely hot state by obtaining a hot-wombed being, similarly, when those devas engage in bodily intercourse with the Apsaras, their desiring mind is quickly pacified and satisfied.

[Q.] Bhagavan! Do those devas have semen-pudgalas? [A.] Yes, Gautama, they do. [Q.] Bhagavan! In what forms do they repeatedly transform for those Apsaras? [A.] Gautama, they transform for them repeatedly in the form of the sense organs - auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, and tactile, as well as in the form of the desirable, charming, pleasing, extremely pleasing, auspicious, and fortune-youth-grace-beauty forms.

[2052-3] Among them, the touch-attending devas, a desire arises in their minds, just as the statement made regarding the devas who engage in bodily intercourse, the entire statement should be said similarly.

[2052-4] Among them, the form-attending devas, a desire arises in their minds that we want to engage in form-attendance with the Apsaras. When the devas think so in their minds, the (Apsaras) create the same way up to the Uttaravaikriya forms. Having created the transformation, they approach where those devas are, and standing not too far and not too close to those devas, they display those generous up to delightful Uttaravaikriya forms. Then those devas engage in form-attendance with those Apsaras. The rest of the statement should be said in the same way up to they repeatedly transform.

Page #1407:
---------------------------
[5] Among those, the **Sahapariyara** gods, they have a desire arising - "We wish to perform **Sahapariyara** with the Apsaras." When these gods think this way, the Apsaras, in the same way, through **Uttaraveubbiai** forms of **Ruvai** and **Viuti**, reach the place where those gods are. Having reached there, they remain near those gods, not too far, not too close, and continuously utter the highest and lowest **Saddai** sounds. Thus, those gods perform **Sahapariyara** with those Apsaras. The rest of the narrative continues in the same way, repeatedly. [2052-5]

[6] Among those, the **Manpariyara** gods, they have a desire arising - "We wish to perform **Manpariyara** with the Apsaras." When these gods think this way, those Apsaras, immediately, remaining in their own place, continuously hold the highest and lowest **Manai** with **Anuttarai** and **Ucchavaya**. Thus, those gods perform **Manpariyara** with those Apsaras. The rest of the narrative continues in the same way, repeatedly. [2052-6]

[2053]  "O Venerable One! Among these **Kaya**-**Pariyara**, **Man**-**Pariyara**, and **Apariyara** gods, which ones are less, more, equal, or superior?"

"Gautama! The **Apariyara** gods are the least, the **Manpariyara** gods are **Sankejjaguna**, the **Sahapariyara** gods are **Asankejjaguna**, the **Rubpariyara** gods are **Asankejjaguna**, the **Phaspariyara** gods are **Asankejjaguna**, and the **Kaya**-**Pariyara** gods are **Asankejjaguna."

"The Blessed One, in the **Pannavanai**, has declared this **Parivaranapam** as the thirty-fourth." [2053]

Chautisa Paricharnapa (The Thirty-four Attendants)

(1) There are 213 Paricharak Devas (Attendant Devas), and they have innumerable Shabdaparicharak Devas (Devas who attend through sound), who in turn have innumerable Rupaparicharak Devas (Devas who attend through form), who have innumerable Sparshparicharak Devas (Devas who attend through touch), and they have innumerable Kayaparicharak Devas (Devas who attend through body).

(2) In the sixth door called 'Paricharnana' (Attending), the various aspects of the Devas' attending have been discussed primarily from four perspectives: (1) Do the Devas attend with or without the Devis (female Deities)? And are there also Aparicharak (non-attending) Devas? (2) The five types of attending, which Devas perform which type of attending, and which Devas are Aparicharak? (3) The nature, method, and result of attending from Kayaparicharnana (attending through body) to Manah-paricharnana (attending through mind). (4) The relative prevalence of Paricharak (attending) and Aparicharak (non-attending) Devas.

(3) The key conclusions are: (1) There are no Devas who are completely devoid of attending even when residing with the Devis; some Devas attend with the Devis, some Devas attend without the Devis, and some Devas are devoid of both Devis and attending. (2) The Vaimanikas (celestial Devas) from Bhavanapatni to Ishanakalpas have Sadevika (with Devis) as well as Paricharnana (attending). However, the Vaimanikas from Sanatkumara to Achyutakalpa do not reside with Devis, yet they have Paricharnana. These Devas attend the Devis born in Dharma and Ishanakalpas through touch, form, sound, and mind. (3) The Devas from Bhavanapatni to Ishanakalpas perform Kayaparicharnana (attending through body), the Devas of Sanatkumara and Mahendrakalpa perform Sparshparicharnana (attending through touch), the Devas of Brahmaloka and Lantakakalpa perform Rupaparicharnana (attending through form), the Devas of Mahasukra and Sahasrarakalpa perform Shabdaparicharnana (attending through sound), and the Devas of Panata, Pranata, Parana, and Achyutakalpa perform Manaḥparicharnana (attending through mind). (4) The Nava Graivayas and Panca Anuuttaravimanavasins are devoid of both Devis and Paricharnana, and their Purushavedas (male sexual desires) are extremely feeble, so they do not perform Manaḥparicharnana either.

1. The devas who are sensory-object enjoyers (śabdaparicāraka devas) experience infinite bliss merely by hearing the sweet sounds of the songs, laughter, melodious voices, recitations, and the jingling of the anklets of their beloved deva-maidens. This alone pacifies their sensual desires.

2. The devas who are mind-object enjoyers (manḥparicāraka devas) experience infinite bliss by mentally desiring their chosen deva-maidens. This alone pacifies their sensual desires.

3. The devas of the nine Graiveyaka heavens and the five Anuttara-vimānas are non-sensory-object enjoyers (apraticaraka). Their delusion and sensual desires are extremely mild. Hence, they remain absorbed in their tranquil bliss.

4. However, since they lack the attainment of right conduct (cāritra-pariṇāma), they cannot be called celibate (brahmacārī).

Two questions:
1. What kind of satisfaction? The devas attain the same kind of satisfaction and cessation of sensual desires from their so-called sensual enjoyments, as cold matter is extremely pleasurable for a being with a calm nature, or hot matter is extremely pleasurable and calming for a being with a hot nature.

2. Unlike humans, the devas' seminal particles (śukrapudgalas) do not discharge through physical sexual intercourse, but they enter the bodies of the deva-maidens, becoming the five senses and manifesting as desirable, beloved, pleasant, and charming forms, as well as auspiciousness, beauty, youth, and grace.

The mind is the central point of these experiences. Various types of pain are imprinted on the mind. * The mind receives and reflects these pains in the form of experiences. This is why the author of the text has presented a glimpse of the various pains imprinted on the mind due to various causes in this chapter. * There are various meanings of *vedanā* (pain). For example, knowledge, experience of pleasure and pain, suffering, sorrow, distress, pain caused by illness, experience of the fruits of karma, experience of the *sāta* (real) and *asāta* (unreal), experience of the *udaya* (arising) and *abalikā* (decay) of karma, etc. * In the context of all these meanings, this chapter presents seven *dvāra* (gates) related to pain, which describe various pains. * These seven gates are as follows: (1) The first is the *śītavedanādvāra* (gate of cold pain), which describes cold, hot, and lukewarm pain. (2) The second is the *dravya dvāra* (gate of substance), which describes pain related to substance, space, time, and emotion. (3) The third is the *śarīravedanādvāra* (gate of bodily pain), which describes physical, mental, and physical-mental pain. (4) The fourth is the *sātavedanādvāra* (gate of real pain), which describes *sāta*, *asāta*, and *sāta-asāta* pain. (5) The fifth is the *duḥkhavedanādvāra* (gate of pain of suffering), which describes pain in the form of suffering, pain in the form of pleasure, and pain in the form of both suffering and pleasure. (6) The sixth is the *ābhyūpagamiki* and *pāpakramiki vedanādvāra* (gate of pain of approach and decline), which describes both these types of pain. (7) The seventh is the *nidā-anidāvedanādvāra* (gate of pain of existence and non-existence), which describes both these types of pain. * After this, it is explained which pain is experienced by which beings and which is not. For example, *ekendriya* (one-sensed), *vikaleṇdriya* (impaired-sensed), and *asanjīpacendriya* (non-conscious-sensed) beings are devoid of mental pain. All other beings in the world experience pain in all the other gates. * 1. (a) *Paiāsaddamaṇṇavo*. p. 776 (b) *Abhi*, *Rā. Koṣa*, *Bhā*. 6, p. 1438 2. *Paṇṇavaṇāsuuttaṃ Bhā*. 1 (Mū. Pā.

## Translation:

**216] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra * The sixth and seventh gates among these seven gates are known as pains. Those pains that are accepted willingly and with pleasure, such as those caused by hair, dirt, etc., are called *prābyupgamikī*, but those pains that arise from the awakening of karmas and the emergence of *vedanīyakarma* are called *aupakramikī*. / Both these pains are related to karmas. / The seventh gate describes two types of pain: *nidā* and *anidā*. When the mind is fully engaged or when it is carefully attended to, it is called *nidā*, and the opposite, where the mind is not at all engaged, is called *anidā* pain. / Alternatively, pain with *cittavati-samyaviveka* is *nidā*, and the opposite is *anidā*. / In reality, these two pains are later connected to *sañjñī* and *asañjñī* respectively. / The *vṛttikāra* has explained the meaning of *nidā* pain as follows: In the case of an *asañjñī* being, the mind is not skillful in remembering past-life related good and bad karmas, hatred, opposition, or objects. However, the mind of a *sañjñī* being is skillful. / Therefore, *anidā* pain is experienced by *asañjñī* beings, and *nidā* pain is experienced by *sañjñī* beings. Similarly, it is also explained that beings with *māyī-mithyā-dṛṣṭi* experience *anidā* pain, and beings with *amāyī-samyag-dṛṣṭi* experience *nidā* pain. Some clarifications - (1) Is the use (experience) of cold and hot pain gradual or simultaneous? The *vṛttikāra* has solved this by saying that the use is indeed gradual, but due to rapid transmission, it does not appear gradual in experience. (2) Similarly, one should understand the pain of cold and hot, etc. / Similarly, the pain of *aduḥkha-asukha* cannot be given the designation of pleasure or pain. Similarly, one should understand the subject of physical-mental designation, *sāta-asāta*, pleasure-pain, etc. (3) What is the difference between *sāta-asāta* and pleasure-pain? The *vṛttikāra* has answered this by saying that the pain that arises from the gradual emergence of *vedanīyakarma* pudgalas is *sāta-asāta*. But when something else causes an awakening and there is an experience of *sāta-asāta*, it is called pleasure-pain. '* Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama* mentions three types: *bajjhamaṇiya veyaṇā, udiṇṇā veyaṇā, uvasantā veyaṇā*. 00 1. (a) *Paṇṇavaṇā Sutta*, Bha. 2 (Introduction), p. 150 (b) *Prajñāpanā*. M. Vṛtti, p. 557

## The Thirty-Fifth Vedana-pada (Chapter on Sensations)

**The Thirty-Fifth Vedana-pada** (Chapter on Sensations) **explains the seven gates of sensations:**

1. **Sheet** (Cold) - This also includes **Ushna** (Hot) and **Sheetoshna** (Warm).
2. **Dravya** (Substance) - This includes sensations arising from **Dravya** (Substance), **Kshetra** (Space), **Kala** (Time), and **Bhaava** (Emotion).
3. **Sharira** (Body) - This includes sensations arising from the **physical body**, **mind**, and **combined body and mind**.
4. **Saata** (Present) - This includes **Saata** (Present), **Asaata** (Absent), and **Saata-Saata** (Both present and absent) sensations.
5. **Dukkha** (Pain) - This includes **Dukkha** (Pain), **Sukha** (Pleasure), and **Adukkha-Asukha** (Neither pain nor pleasure) sensations.
6. **Aabhyupgamiki** (Approaching) and **Oupkramaiki** (Departing) - This explains these two types of sensations.
7. **Nida** (Sleep) and **Anida** (Wakefulness) - This explains the relationship between these two types of sensations.

**Which beings experience which sensations?**

The second verse states that all beings experience **Saata-Asaata** and **Saata-Saata** sensations. Similarly, all beings experience **Sukha** (Pleasure), **Dukkha** (Pain), or **Adukkha-Asukha** (Neither pain nor pleasure) sensations. Beings with **Vikalendriya** (Defective senses) and **Asanjee-Panchendriya** (Five senses without consciousness) experience sensations without **Manas** (Mind). The remaining beings experience both **physical** and **mental** sensations.

'Generally, Narakas experience cold or hot Vedana. But they do not experience cold-hot Vedana. Narakas of the first three Naraka-Prithvis experience hot Vedana, because their basic Naraka-avas are made of very red, very hot, and very hot Pudgalas, like the embers of Khaira. In the fourth Pankaprabha Prithvi, some Narakas experience hot Vedana and some experience cold Vedana, because there, some Naraka-avas are cold and some are hot. Therefore, there are more Narakas who experience hot Vedana, because hot Vedana occurs in many Naraka-avas, while Narakas who experience cold Vedana are very few, because cold Vedana occurs in only a few Naraka-avas / In Dhumaprabha Prithvi, some Narakas experience cold Vedana and some experience hot Vedana, but there are more Narakas who experience cold Vedana and fewer Narakas who experience hot Vedana, because there are many Naraka-avas where only cold Vedana occurs, and very few Naraka-avas where hot Vedana occurs / In the sixth and seventh Naraka-Prithvis, Narakas experience only cold Vedana, because all the Naraka-avas there are very cold and the Narakas are of hot nature / 1.

220) The **Prajñāpanā Sūtra** states that from **Asura-kumāras** to **Vāimānikas**, all experience three types of pain: cold, hot, and both. This means that **Asura-kumāras**, **Bhavana-patis**, **Vāṇa-vyantara**, **Jyotiṣka**, and **Vāimānika** deities experience cold pain when they engage in water sports in large lakes filled with cold water. When a **Madhika** deity becomes enraged and climbs a very fierce **Bhrakuṭi** or sees it as if it were burning, they experience hot pain. For example, **Īśāna-indra** made the **Asura-kumāras** living in the capital of **Bali-cāñcā** feel hot, or they experience hot pain from contact with hot **pudgalas**. When there is a simultaneous contact of cold and hot **pudgalas** in different parts of the body, they experience both cold and hot pain. From **Pṛthvī-kāyikas** to humans, they experience cold pain when snow falls, hot pain when they come into contact with fire, and both cold and hot pain when both types of **pudgalas** combine in different parts of the body.

Second, **dravya-ādi-vedanā-dvāra** 2060. How many types of pain are there, **Bhagavan**? **Gautama**: There are four types of pain. They are: (1) **dravya-taḥ**, (2) **kṣetra-taḥ**, (3) **kāla-taḥ**, and (4) **bhāva-taḥ**. 2061. **Bhagavan**, do **Nairāyikas** experience pain from **dravya** or **bhāva**? **Gautama**: They experience pain from **dravya**, **kṣetra**, and **bhāva**. 2062. The same applies to **Vāimānikas**.

**Explanation**: The four types of pain refer to the origin of pain from **dravya**, **kṣetra**, **kāla**, and **bhāva** materials. Therefore, pain is said to be of four types: from **dravya**, **kṣetra**, **kāla**, and **bhāva**. Pain arising from the contact of a **pudgala** or other **dravya** is called **dravya-vedanā**. Pain arising from **nāraka**, **upapāta-kṣetra**, etc., is called **kṣetra-vedanā**. Pain arising from the contact of **ṛtu**, day-night, etc., is called **kāla-vedanā**. Pain arising from the main cause of the **vedanīya-karma** in the form of **udaya** is called **bhāva-vedanā**. All twenty-four **daṇḍakas** experience pain in the four ways mentioned above. 1. **Prajñāpanā** (**Pramaẏa-bodhinī Ṭīkā**), Part 5, pp. 856-887 2.

Bodily-Mental. [2063 Q.] Bhagavan! How many kinds of pain are there? [2063 A.] Gautama! There are three kinds of pain. Namely, 1. Bodily, 2. Mental, and 3. Bodily-Mental. [2063 A.] 2064. Do the Nairyayikas experience bodily pain, mental pain, or bodily-mental pain, Bhagavan? Gautama! They experience bodily pain, mental pain, and bodily-mental pain. [2064 Q.] Bhagavan! Do the Nairyayikas experience bodily pain, mental pain, or bodily-mental pain? [2064 A.] Gautama! They experience bodily pain, mental pain, and bodily-mental pain. [2064 A.] 2065. Similarly, it should be said up to the Vaimanikas. The one-sensed and the defective-sensed experience only bodily pain, but not mental pain or bodily-mental pain. [2065] Similarly, it should be said up to the Vaimanikas. The one-sensed and the defective-sensed experience only bodily pain, but not mental pain or bodily-mental pain. [2065] Discussion - The nature of the three kinds of pain from another perspective - The pain that occurs in the body is called bodily pain, the pain that occurs in the mind is called mental pain, and the pain that occurs in both the body and mind is called bodily-mental pain. Except for the one-sensed and the defective-sensed, all other Dandakavarti beings experience all three kinds of pain.

[222] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra 2067. "Bhagavan! Does a Nairyāyika experience only sātavedanā, only asātavedanā, or both sāta and asātavedanā?" [2067 U.] "Gautama! They experience all three types of vedanā." [2068] In the same way, all beings up to the Vaimānika experience all three types of vedanā. [2068] The three types of vedanā are: sātavedanā (pleasant vedanā), asātavedanā (unpleasant vedanā), and sāta-asātavedanā (mixed vedanā). [2068] From the Nārakas to the Vaimānika Devas, all beings experience all three types of vedanā. Nārakas experience sātavedanā on occasions like the birth anniversary of a Tīrthankara, and asātavedanā at other times. [2068] When the Pūrvasāṅgatika Devas or Asuras shower nectar in the form of sweet words, it creates sātavedanā in the mind. When the Asuras behave harshly, it creates asātavedanā. [2068] When both these experiences occur, it creates sāta-asātavedanā. [2068] All beings experience all three types of vedanā. When the Pṛthvīkāyikas, etc., are not experiencing any disturbance, they experience sātavedanā. When they experience disturbance, they experience asātavedanā. When they experience disturbance from one source, they experience sāta-asātavedanā. [2068] Devas experience sātavedanā when they are experiencing pleasure, asātavedanā when they are experiencing downfall, and asātavedanā when they experience envy at the prosperity of another Deva. [2068] They also experience sātavedanā when they are engaged in sweet conversation with their beloved Devis. [2068] Thus, they experience both types of vedanā." [2068] 

[2066] "Bhagavan! How many types of vedanā are there?" [2066 U.] "Gautama! There are three types of vedanā: (1) dukkha (unpleasant), (2) sukha (pleasant), and (3) adukkha-sukha (neither unpleasant nor pleasant)." [2066] 

[2070] "Bhagavan! Does a Nairyāyika experience only dukkhavedanā, only sukhavedanā, or only adukkha-sukhavedanā?" [2070 U.] "Gautama! They experience all three types of vedanā: dukkhavedanā, sukhavedanā, and adukkha-sukhavedanā." [2070]

[Thirty-fifth Pain-State] [223 [2070 U.] Gautama! They experience pain-sensation, they experience pleasure-sensation, and they experience neither-pain-nor-pleasure-sensation. 2071. Thus, up to the Vaimānika. [2071] It should be said in the same way up to the Vaimānika. Explanation: The nature of the three types of sensations - that in which there is the sensation of pain is called duhkha, that in which there is the sensation of pleasure is called sukha, and that which is neither pain nor pleasure is called aduhkha-asukha. Sāta, Asāta, and the difference between pleasure and pain - the favorable and unfavorable sensations that arise due to the karmas that are being experienced are called sāta and asāta respectively, and the sāta and asāta that are aroused (produced) by others are called pleasure and pain, this is the difference between the two. All beings experience these three types of sensations. ' Sixth Prābyupgamikī and Aupakramikī Sensation-Gate 2072. How many types of sensations are there, Bhante? Gautama! Sensations are said to be of two types. Such as - Prābyupgamikī and Aupakramikī. [2072 Pr.] Bhagavan! How many types of sensations are there? [2072 U.] Gautama! Sensations are said to be of two types. Such as - Prābyupgamikī and Aupakramikī. 2073. Bhante! Do the Nairyāyika experience Prābyupgamikī sensation or Aupakramikī sensation? Gautama! They do not experience Prābyupgamikī sensation, they experience Aupakramikī sensation. [2073 Pr.] Bhagavan! Do the Nairyāyika experience Prābyupgamikī sensation or Aupakramikī sensation? [2073 U.] Gautama! They do not experience Prābyupgamikī sensation, they experience Aupakramikī sensation. 2074. Thus, up to the Caturindriya. [2074] It should be said in the same way up to the Caturindriya. 2075. The Pancendriya-tiryañcha and the Manushya experience both types of sensations. [2075] The Pancendriya-tiryañcha and the Manushya experience both types of sensations. 2076. In the case of the Vāṇavyantara, Jyotishka, and Vaimānika, it should be said the same as the Nairyāyika (Su. 2073).

## 224] Discussion of the Thirty-First Pain-State: Two Types of Specific Pain: Nature and Possessor

Pain willingly accepted by the self is called **Aabhyoupamiki**. For example, the physical pain experienced by the Sadhugana due to shaving the head, austerities, and heat is willingly accepted. Pain that arises spontaneously or is produced by the awakened karmic force is called **Oupkramiki**. For example, the pain of the Narakas, etc. / The pain of Narakas to the four-sensory beings is **Oupkramiki**. Similarly, the pain of the Vaanavyantar, Jyotishka, and Vaimanika is also **Oupkramiki**. The pain of the five-sensory Tiryanchas and humans is of both types. / 'Seventh Nid-Anid-Vedana-Dwar 2077. How many types of pain are there, Bhagavan? [2077 U.] Gautam! Pain is said to be of two types. Namely, **Nida** and **Anida**. 2078. Bhagavan! Do Narakas experience **Nida** pain or **Anida** pain? [2078 U] Gautam! Narakas experience both **Nida** pain and **Anida** pain. [P.] Bhagavan! Why is it said that Narakas experience both **Nida** pain and **Anida** pain? [U.] Gautam! Narakas are said to be of two types / Namely, **Sanjnibhuta** and **Asanjnibhuta** / Those Narakas who are **Sanjnibhuta** experience **Nida** pain, and those who are **Asanjnibhuta** experience **Anida** pain / O Gautam! For this reason, it is said that Narakas experience both **Nida** pain and **Anida** pain. 2076. Similarly, up to the **Thanikumaras**.

Gautama! All Earth-bodied beings are asanjnī (unconscious) and asanjnībhūta (become unconscious), therefore they experience the pain of the anidā (non-death), not the nidā (death).

Gautama! The Jyotishka gods are of two types, namely: those who have the view of the maimicchadditthi (desire for the body) and those who have the view of the amaimicchadditthi (non-desire for the body). Those who have the view of the maimicchadditthi (desire for the body) experience the pain of the anidā (non-death), and those who have the view of the amaimicchadditthi (non-desire for the body) experience the pain of the nidā (death). For this reason, Gautama! It is said that the Jyotishka gods experience both types of pain. /  [2083 pr.] Bhagavan! Do the Jyotishka gods experience the pain of the nidā (death) or the pain of the anidā (non-death)? [2083 u.] Gautama!

For this reason, O Gautama! It is said that Jyotiṣka Devas are of two types, that they experience Vedana, etc. / 2084. And in the case of Vaimānika Devas, it should be said in the same way. Explanation - Nidā and Anidā: Nature and Authority - That in which the mind is fully engaged, which is well-attended to, is called Nidā, that which is completely different from this, i.e. - towards which the mind is not at all, is called Anidā Vedana. Those sentient beings who have died and become Narakas, they are called Saṁjñībhūta Narakas and those who are non-sentient beings who have died and become Narakas, they are called Asaṁjñī Narakas. Of these, Saṁjñībhūta Narakas experience Nidā Vedana and Asaṁjñībhūta Narakas experience Anidā Vedana. Similarly, the statement is made for Pañcendriya Tiryāñca, Manushya and Vāṇavyantara Devas / Among Jyotiṣka Devas, those who are Māyī Mithyāṣṭi, they experience Anidā Vedana and those who are Amāyī Samyagdṛṣṭi, they experience Nidā Vedana / From Pṛthvīkāyika to Chaturindriya, all experience Anidā Vedana, not Nidā Vedana, because being non-sentient, they do not have a mind, for this reason, they experience only Anidā Vedana / Non-sentient beings do not remember the good and bad karmas done in their previous births or the hatred etc. The fact is that only the karmas done with intense determination are remembered, but in the previous Asaṁjñībhavam, the determination of Pṛthvīkāyika etc. was not intense, because they were devoid of Dravyaman. For this reason, Asaṁjñī Narakas do not have a skillful mind to remember the subjects related to the previous birth, while Saṁjñī Narakas remember the karmas or hatred-opposition related to the previous birth. For this reason, they experience Nidā Vedana. All Pṛthvīkāyika etc. beings, being non-sentient, experience Anidā Vedana, which is devoid of discrimination.

This is the thirty-sixth *Samudghāta* chapter of the *Prajñāpanā Sūtra*. It discusses *Samudghāta*, its types, and which *Samudghāta* occurs in which of the twenty-four *Daṇḍakas*. 'Samudghāta' is a technical term in Jain Dharmaśāstra. According to its etymology, it means to strike, injure, or inflict pain with intensity and oneness. The commentator explains it as the intense oneness of the soul with the results of experience, such as pain. Its practical meaning is that by abstaining from other results, pain, etc., quickly bring to fruition many regions of those karmas by stimulation, experience them, and exhaust them, i.e., separate them from the regions of the soul, shake them off. In reality, *Samudghāta* has a close relationship with karmas. To stimulate karmas that are attached to the soul and will be experienced and exhausted after a long time, bring them to the stage of fruition, and then integrate them with pain, etc., and exhaust them - to strike those karmas with intensity is *Samudghāta*. Jain philosophy does not consider the development of the soul without the destruction of karmas attached to it. The purification and development of the soul can be accelerated by the destruction of karmas through *Samudghāta*. Therefore, *Samudghāta* is a spiritual weapon by which the seeker can remain awake, experience the fruits of karma with equanimity, and quickly destroy karmas. For this reason, *Samudghāta* is said to be of seven types: (1) *Vedanasamudghāta*, (2) *Kaṣāyasamudghāta*, (3) *Māraṇāntikasamudghāta*, (4) *Vaikriyasamudghāta*, (5) *Taijasasamudghāta*, (6) *Āhārakasamudghāta*, and (7) *Kevalasamudghāta*. The commentator has explained which *Samudghāta* is dependent on which karma. For example, *Vedanasamudghāta* is dependent on *Asātavedaniya* karma, *Kaṣāyasamudghāta* is dependent on *Cāritramohaniya* karma, *Māraṇāntikasamudghāta* is dependent on *Āyuṣya* karma, *Vaikriyasamudghāta* is dependent on *Vaikriyasharīranāma* karma, *Taijasasamudghāta* is dependent on *Taijassharīranāma* karma, *Āhārakasamudghāta* is dependent on *Āhārakasharīranāma* karma, and *Kevalasamudghāta* is dependent on *Śubha-Aśubhanāmakarma*, *Sāta-Asātavedaniya*, and *Ucca-Nīcagotra* karma.

##  Translation:

[228] *The *Prajñāpanā Sūtra*  briefly explains the process of each of the seven *samuddhātas* (disturbances) and how they lead to the destruction of the associated karma. It then discusses the duration of each *samuddhāta*, stating that *kelisamuddhāta* lasts for 8 *kalas* (units of time), while the remaining *samuddhātas* last for an immeasurable number of *antarmuhūrta* (sub-moments).  

The text further clarifies the number of *samuddhātas* experienced by different types of beings. It then elaborates on the number of *samuddhātas* experienced by each type of being in the past and the potential number in the future. 

*The text then explains the number of *samuddhātas* possible for each type of being in its own state (**svasthan**), and in other states (**parasthan**), both in the past and future. It then considers the relative scarcity or abundance of beings based on their *samuddhātas*.

*The text then discusses the four types of *kṣayāsamuddhāta* (disturbances related to passions) and examines the *samuddhātas* of the past and future in relation to them. It also considers the past and future *kṣayāsamuddhātas* in relation to **svasthan** and **parasthan**, and their relative scarcity or abundance.

*The text then examines the *samuddhātas* related to *vedanā* (sensation) and others, from the perspective of *avagāhana* (perception) and *sparśa* (contact). It explains the duration of *avagāhana* and *sparśa* for each type of being, and the number of actions required for a being to experience a particular *samuddhāta*.

Finally, the text discusses *kelisamuddhāta* from various perspectives. It explains that a *sayogi kevali* (a liberated being with a physical body) does not become a *siddha* (fully liberated being) until they have attained the state of *ayogi* (non-action) by restraining their mind, speech, and body. The text also elaborates on the process of attaining *siddhatva* (liberation) and describes the nature of *siddhas*.

How many types of Samudghāt are said? [2086 U.] Gautama! Seven Samudghāt are said / Such as - (1) Veḍanāsamudghāt, (2) Kasāyasamudghāt, (3) Māraṇāntikasamudghāt, (4) Vaikriyasamudghāt, (5) Taijasasamudghāt, (6) Āhārakasamudghāt and (7) Kevalisamudghāt / Discussion - Samudghāt: In the form and type of Samudghāt, Sam + Ud + Ghāt, these three words are there. According to grammar, their meaning is - Sam - Ekobhāvapūrvaka, Ut - Prabalatā se, Ghāt - Ghāt karṇā. The meaning is that to strike with intensity with concentration / The meaning is that to become united with Veḍanā etc. in an excellent way / The meaning is that at the time of Veḍanā etc. Samudghāt, the Ātmā becomes transformed into Veḍanādi-jñāna form, it does not have any other perception. When the Jīva becomes transformed into Veḍanādi Samudghāt, then in due course, by the process of Udiranākaraṇa, it pulls the regions of Veḍanīyādi Karmas which are capable of being experienced, puts them into Udayāvalikā, experiences them and destroys them, i.e. - separates them from the Ātmā-pradeśas. This is the intensity of Ghāt. The shedding of past Karmas, their separation from the Ātmā is Nirjarā. Samudghāt are of seven types - (1) Veḍanā, (2) Kasāya, (3) Māraṇāntika, (4) Vaikriya, (5) Tejas, (6) Āhārak and (7) Kevali. Which Samudghāt is dependent on which Karma? - Out of these, Veḍanāsamudghāt is dependent on Asātāveḍanīya-Karma, Kasāyasamudghāt is dependent on Cāritramohaniya-Karma, Māraṇāntikasamudghāt is dependent on Antarmūhūrta Śeṣa Āyuṣya-Karma, Vaikriyasamudghāt is dependent on Vaikriyaśarīranāma-Karma, Taijasasamudghāt is dependent on Taijasaśarīranāma-Karma,

It is said to be eight times." [2088 U.]  /  **Discussion Conclusion**  From Vedanasamudghāta to Āhārakasamudghāta, the Samudghāta-kāla is Antarmūhūrta, but that Antarmūhūrta should be understood as countless times.

**Discussion on *Samuddhāta*: How many and why?**

*Nārakas* have the initial four *samuddhāta* because they lack *Tejolabdhi*, *Āhārakalabdhi* and *Kevalītava*, so they do not have *Taijas*, *Āhārak* and *Kevalīsamuddhāta*. 

*Asurkumārādi* ten *Bhavanapaṭi* Devas have the initial four and the fifth *Taijasasamuddhāta* is also possible. 

*Pṛthvīkāyikādi* five *sthāvara* have the initial three *samuddhāta*, but *Vāyukkāyik* beings have the first three and one *Vaikriyasamuddhāta*, thus four *samuddhāta*.

(1) Vedanāsamudghāta—Each naraka has experienced infinite vedanāsamudghāta, because the narakadi places are infinite. Each naraka-place has been attained infinite times and at the time of attaining a naraka-place once, a naraka has experienced vedanāsamudghāta many times. This statement should be understood from the point of view of abundance. Many beings have experienced infinite time from the avyāvahāra-rāśi

## Thirty-sixth Chapter of the Samudghāt Pada [235 have passed / An infinite number of Vedanasamudghāt have passed in the past, compared to one Naraka. For those beings who have spent a short time in the Naraka, as per their deeds, one should understand that a countable or uncountable number of Vedanasamudghāt have passed. Regarding the future Samudghāt of each Naraka, it has been said that some Narakas have future Samudghāt, while others do not / This means that for a being who, after the time of the Prishcha, will leave Naraka without experiencing Vedanasamudghāt, attain human birth, and achieve Siddhi without experiencing Vedanasamudghāt, there is not even one Vedanasamudghāt. For a being who, after this Prishcha time, will remain in Naraka for some time due to the remaining lifespan and then attain human birth and achieve Siddhi, one, two, or three Vedanasamudghāt are possible. For a Naraka who remains in the world for a countable period, there are countable Vedanasamudghāt, for one who remains for an uncountable period, there are uncountable Vedanasamudghāt, and for one who remains for an infinite period, there are infinite future Samudghāt. Similar to Narakas, the Bhavanapatis like Asurakumara, the Ekaindriya beings like Prithvikaayika, the Vikalendriya beings, the Panchendriya Tiryancha, humans, Vaanavyantara, Jyotishka, and Vaimanika, have also experienced an infinite number of Vedanasamudghāt in the past, and some have future Vedanasamudghāt, while others do not. For those who have them, they are either minor, one, two, or three, or major, countable, uncountable, or infinite.'] [1-3-4-5] One should understand the statements related to Kshaya, Maaranantika, Vaikriya, and Tejas-Samudghāt, in the order of twenty-four Dandakas. (6) Regarding the question of past Aahaarak-Samudghāt of each Naraka, it has been said that some have Aahaarak-Samudghāt, while others do not. For a Naraka who has experienced past Aahaarak-Samudghāt, there are either minor, one or two, or major, three / A Naraka who has previously attained human birth and, due to the lack of suitable materials, has not studied the fourteen Purvas, or even if he has studied the fourteen Purvas, has not created an Aahaarak-Sharira due to the lack of Aahaarak-Kalabdhi or due to the absence of any specific purpose, does not have past Aahaarak-Samudghāt / A Naraka different from this type has minor, one or two, and major, three Aahaarak-Samudghāt / There cannot be four, because a being who has created an Aahaarak-Sharira four times cannot go to Naraka. Future Aahaarak-Samudghāt also occur for some, while others do not. For those who have them, there are minor, one, two, or three, and major, four. A Naraka who attains human birth and, due to the lack of suitable materials, does not study the fourteen Purvas, or even if he studies them, does not experience Aahaarak-Samudghāt and achieves Siddhi, does not have future Aahaarak-Samudghāt.

[236] The *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* states that there are four types of *āhārakasamudghāta* for hell beings: one, two, or three for the inferior types, and four for the superior. There cannot be more than four *āhārakasamudghāta* because after that, the being does not go to another realm according to the rules and attains liberation without further *āhārakasamudghāta*. Similarly, one should understand the past and future *āhārakasamudghāta* of beings from *asurakumāra* and other *bhavanapati* up to the *vaimānika*. However, the past and future *āhārakasamudghāta* of humans are the same as those of hell beings. Just as there are one, two, or three inferior and four superior *āhārakasamudghāta* for hell beings, so too are there for humans. (7) There is no past *kevalisamudghāta* for any hell being, because after *kevalisamudghāta*, the being attains liberation within a moment according to the rules. It is then impossible for them to go to hell and become a hell being. Therefore, past *kevalisamudghāta* is not possible for any hell being. Now, regarding the question of future *kevalisamudghāta* for hell beings, it happens for some and not for others. For those who experience it, there is only one *kevalisamudghāta*. There cannot be more than one, because through a single *kevalisamudghāta*, the four *aghātika karma* are equalised, and the being attains liberation within a moment. After that, no one needs another *kevalisamudghāta*. The hell being who will get the opportunity to attain liberation after wandering through the cycle of births and deaths will have unequal *aghātika karma*. To equalise them, they will perform *kevalisamudghāta*. This will be their future *kevalisamudghāta*. For those hell beings who attain liberation without *kevalisamudghāta* or those who will never attain liberation (the *abhavya*), there is no future *kevalisamudghāta*. Besides humans, *bhavanapati*, *pṛthvīkāyika*, etc., *ekendriya*, *vikaleṇdriya*, *pañcendriya-tiryañc*, *vāṇavyantara*, *jyotiṣka*, and *vaimānika* gods also do not have past *kevalisamudghāta*. Future *kevalisamudghāta* happens for some and not for others. For those who experience it, there is only one. The reasoning is the same as before. Some humans have past *kevalisamudghāta*, while others do not. For those who have it, there is only one. For the human who has already performed *kevalisamudghāta* and has not yet attained liberation, but is about to attain it within a moment, there is past *kevalisamudghāta*. However, for the human who has not performed *kevalisamudghāta*, there is no past *kevalisamudghāta*. One should also understand the statement about future *kevalisamudghāta* for humans, similar to past *kevalisamudghāta*. Like the past, future *kevalisamudghāta* also happens for some and not for others. For those who experience it, there is only one, not more. 1.

[238] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra [2066-2] In the same way, one should understand the statement up to the Vāimānikas. The special feature is that there is a difference in the statement of the Vanaspatikāyikas and humans.  /  For example, [Pr.] O Bhagavan! How many Pāhārakasamudghāta have been experienced by the Vanaspatikāyika beings? [U.] Gautama! (Their) infinite (Pāhārakasamudghāta have been experienced). [Pr.] O Bhagavan!

How many Kevalisamudghāta have been experienced by the Nairyāyikas? Gautama! None. How many are to come? Gautama! Uncountable. [2100-1 Pr.] O Bhagavan!

How many Kevalisamudghāta have been experienced by the Vanaspatikāyikas? Gautama! None. How many are to come? Gautama! Infinite. O Bhante! How many Kevalisamudghāta have been experienced by humans? Gautama! They are either there or not. If they are there, they are one or two or three, or at most seven. How many are to come? Gautama! They are either countable or uncountable. [2100-2 Pr.] In the same way, one should understand up to the Vāimānikas. The special feature is that there is a difference in the statement of the Vanaspatikāyikas and humans (regarding the Kevalisamudghāta). For example, [Pr.] O Bhagavan! How many Kevalisamudghāta have been experienced by the Vanaspatikāyikas? [U.] Gautama! (Their Kevalisamudghāta have been experienced) not.

Thirty-sixth Chapter of the Discourse [239 [Q.] O Bhagavan! How many future Kevali-Samudghātas are there? [A.] Gautama! They are infinite. [Q.] O Bhagavan! How many Kevali-Samudghātas of humans are there in the past? [A.] Gautama! There are some and there are none. If there are, then the lowest are one, two or three and the highest are one hundred separate. [Q.] O Bhagavan! How many are their future Kevali-Samudghātas said to be? [A.] Gautama! Some are countable and some are uncountable. / Discussion - The description of Vedana-Samudghāta etc. in relation to the multitude in Naraka etc. - The Vedana-Samudghātas of Narakas have been infinite in the past, because many Narakas have passed through infinite time, which has come out of the stock of actions. Their future Samudghātas are also infinite, because many Narakas will remain in the world for infinite time. The Vedana-Samudghātas of Asura-Kumāra etc. Bhavanapatis, Prithvi-Kāyika etc. Ekendriyas, Vikalendriyas, Tiryanch-Panchendriyas, humans, Vāṇavyantaras, Jyotishkas and Vaimānikas are also infinite in the past and future. Like Vedana-Samudghāta, the statement of Kashaya, Māranāntika, Vaikriya and Taijasa Samudghāta should also be understood. All of these should be described in the plural form in twenty-four Dandakas. The past Āhāraka-Samudghāta of Narakas is uncountable. This means that although all Narakas are uncountable, yet there are some uncountable Narakas who have already done Āhāraka-Samudghāta in the past, in relation to them, the past Āhāraka-Samudghāta of Narakas is said to be uncountable. Similarly, the future Āhāraka-Samudghāta of Narakas should also be understood as uncountable by the above mentioned logic. Except for Vanaspati-Kāyikas and humans, the past and future Āhāraka-Samudghāta in the remaining Dandakas up to Vaimānika is uncountable as before. The past Āhāraka-Samudghāta of Vanaspati-Kāyikas is infinite in relation to the plural. Because there are infinite Vanaspati-Kāyika beings who had the knowledge of fourteen pasts in the past, but due to being under the influence of negligence, they have increased in the world and are present in the Vanaspati-Kāyikas. The future Āhāraka-Samudghāta of Vanaspati-Kāyikas is also infinite, because out of the beings who are in the Vanaspati-Kāya at the time of the question, infinite beings will come out of the Vanaspati-Kāyikas and attain human birth, obtain the knowledge of fourteen pasts, do Āhāraka-Samudghāta and attain Siddhi. The past and future Āhāraka-Samudghāta of humans is possibly countable and possibly uncountable in relation to the plural. This means that the number of regions in an area the size of a fingertip, including Samūcchima and Garbhaja humans, is the third root of the first square root multiplied by 1. Prajñāpanā. Malaya-Vṛtti, A. Rā. Koṣa, Bhā. 7, p. 438

Page #1435:
---------------------------
[240] The number of humans in a single region of a world inhabited by beings with a finite number of regions, as determined by the *Prajñāpanā Sūtra*, is one less than the total number of humans in that region. This number of humans is less than the number of beings in other realms, such as hell. Among these humans, those who have formed a physical body in past lives are fewer in number, and thus their number is either finite or infinite. Similarly, the future *kevalisamudghāta* of humans should be understood as either finite or infinite, according to the aforementioned logic.

There is not a single past *kevalisamudghāta* of hell beings, because it is impossible for a being who has attained *kevalisamudghāta* to be born in hell. The future *kevalisamudghāta* of hell beings is infinite, because at the time of inquiry, there are always an infinite number of hell beings who will attain *kevalisamudghāta* in the future. This is known through *kevalajñāna*.

The same logic applies to beings from other realms, such as *asurakumāra* and other *bhavanapati* (lords of realms), up to the *vaimānika* (celestial beings), excluding plants and humans. They also do not have past *kevalisamudghāta*, and their future *kevalisamudghāta* is infinite.

The past *kevalisamudghāta* of plants does not follow the aforementioned logic. Their future *kevalisamudghāta* is infinite, because there are an infinite number of plants who will become *kevali* and attain *kevalisamudghāta* in the future.

The past *kevalisamudghāta* of humans is either finite or infinite. If there is a *kevali* (liberated being) who has attained *kevalisamudghāta* and is still alive at the time of inquiry, then there are past *kevalisamudghāta*. Otherwise, there are none. If there are past *kevalisamudghāta*, they are at least one, two, or three, and at most, they are *śatapṛthaktva* (two hundred to nine hundred). The future *kevalisamudghāta* of humans is either finite or infinite.

At the time of inquiry, there are many *abhavya* (non-liberable beings) among *samucchima* (born from a womb) and *garbhaja* (born from a womb) humans, who are not capable of attaining *kevalisamudghāta* in the future. Therefore, the future *kevalisamudghāta* is finite. However, it is also possible that they are infinite, because there are many humans who will attain *kevalisamudghāta* in the future.

[2101] [1] "Venerable sir, how many *vedanāsamudghāta* (liberation from pain) are there in the past for a being?" "They are infinite." "How many *pūrekkhaḍā* (liberation from karma) are there?" "It is either there or not. If there are *pūrekkhaḍā*, they are either one, two, or three, or they are infinite, either finite or infinite, or they are *praṇata* (limited)."

They are infinite. [Q.] Lord! How many future *vedanasamudghat* are there (for each individual in the hell realm)? [A.] Gautama! Some have them, some do not. For those who have them, the least number is one, two, or three, and the greatest number is countable, uncountable, or infinite. [2] Similarly, for each individual in the *asurakumar* realm up to the *vaimanika* realm, one should understand the past and future *vedanasamudghat* in the same way. 2102. [Q.] Lord! How many past *vedanasamudghat* have occurred for each individual in the *asurakumar* realm? [2102 A.] Gautama! They are infinite. [Q.] Lord! How many future *vedanasamudghat* are there? [A.] Gautama! Some have them, some do not. For those who have them, the number is perhaps countable, perhaps uncountable, and perhaps infinite. [2103. [1] Q.] Lord! How many past *vedanasamudghat* have occurred for each individual in the *asurakumar* realm while residing in the *asurakumar* realm? [2103-1 A.] Gautama! They are infinite. [Q.] Lord! How many future *vedanasamudghat* are there for them? [A.] Gautama! Some have them, some do not. For those who have them, the least number is one, two, or three, and the greatest number is countable, uncountable, or infinite.

[2103-2] In the same way, while residing in the Nāgakumāra-paryāya up to the Vaimānika-paryāya, one should understand the past and future vedanā-samudghāta. 2104. [1] Just as the vedanā-samudghāta has been described from the Nārak-paryāya of the Asurakumāra up to the Vaimānika-paryāya, in the same way, from the Nāgakumāra and others, up to the remaining all Svasthāna and Parastthāna, the vedanā-samudghāta should be described up to the Vaimānika-paryāya of the Vaimānika.

For those for whom it occurs, it is only one. Similarly, the future (should also be said in relation to *kevali-samudghata*.) [4] *Ekamete chauveesam chauveesa dandaga*. [2120-4] Thus, these twenty-four *dandakas* should be known in the twenty-four *dandakas*. Discussion—In the *narkatva-adi* *paryaya* of each individual being, the past, future, and *samudghata* forms were previously questioned. The question was asked, "How many past *samudghatas* does a being in hell have?" Here, the question is being asked, "How many *vedana-samudghatas* did the being in hell experience while residing in the hellish state?" In other words, previously, the calculation of *vedana-samudghatas* performed by the being in hell in any of the twenty-four *dandakas* was intended. Here, however, the calculation of *vedana-samudghatas* performed only in the hellish *paryaya* is intended. The *vedana-samudghatas* that the current being in hell performed in other *paryayas* are not intended here. Similarly, in other realms, only one *paryaya* is intended. For example, the *vedana-samudghatas* that the being in hell performed in the *asura-kumara* state will be counted, but the *vedana-samudghatas* performed in other states are not intended. In this chapter, this particularity should be kept in mind. (1) *Vedana-samudghata*—A being in hell who has resided in the hellish *paryaya* has experienced infinite *vedana-samudghatas*, because they have attained the hellish *paryaya* an infinite number of times, and even in a single hellish birth, there are at least a countable number of *vedana-samudghatas*. Additionally, in relation to the entirety of the future time until the being's liberation, there are future *vedana-samudghatas* for some, but not for others. A being in hell who is nearing death may be liberated from hell and attain human birth, becoming free through the *maranantika-samudghata* without experiencing any *vedana-samudghatas*. Such a being in hell does not experience future *vedana-samudghatas* related to the hellish *paryaya*. For those beings in hell who do have future *samudghatas* related to the hellish *paryaya*, they are either few in number, such as one, two, or three, or they are numerous, countless, or infinite. Just as the *vedana-samudghatas* of beings in hell related to the hellish *paryaya* have been described, similarly, in the *asura-kumara* *paryaya* of a being in hell, or in any *paryaya* up to the *stanita-kumara* *paryaya*, in the *bhavanapati-deva* *paryaya*, in the *prithvi-kayika* *paryaya* and other *eka-indriya* *paryayas*, in the *vikala-indriya* *paryaya*, in the *pancha-indriya* *paryaya*, in the *manushya* *paryaya*, in the *vanavyanta*, *jyotishka*, and *vaimanika* *paryayas*, an infinite number of *vedana-samudghatas* appear in relation to the entirety of the past time. Future *vedana-samudghatas* occur for some, but not for others. For those for whom they occur, they are either few in number, such as one, two, or three, or they are numerous, countless, or infinite. Of these, those whose remaining lifespan is dwindling and who are destined for liberation in that very birth are said to have one, two, or three future *vedana-samudghatas*. A being who is destined to be reborn in hell will experience a countable number of future *vedana-samudghatas*, even if they are few in number. These countable *samudghatas* should be understood to apply to a being in hell who is reborn only once and in a state of minimal suffering. A being who is reborn many times and in a state of prolonged suffering will experience countless future *vedana-samudghatas*. A being who is reborn an infinite number of times will experience an infinite number of future *vedana-samudghatas*.

[Pragyapana Sutra] One by one, the asura-kumara have passed through infinite states of torment in the nāraka-avasthā, because in the past they have attained the nāraka-avasthā countless times, and in each nāraka-bhava, countless states of torment occur. The future states of torment in the nāraka-avasthā of one asura-kumara are present for some, and not present for others. For those who have them, they may be countable, innumerable, or infinite. The asura-kumara who will never be born in the nāraka-bhava, but will attain the siddha state in the next or subsequent birth after the human birth, does not have future states of torment related to the nāraka-paryāya, because he will not attain the nāraka-paryāya. The asura-kumara who will go to the nāraka after that birth in the lineage, has future states of torment, and among them, the one who will be born in the nāraka of the lowest state, has countable states of torment as well, because there is abundance of torment in the nāraka.

If he goes to the nāraka of the lowest state many times, he will have innumerable states of torment, and if he goes to the nāraka infinite times, he will have infinite states of torment.

Similarly, the asura-kumara has had infinite states of torment in the past in the asura-kumāra-avasthā, and in this state, the future states of torment are present for some, and not present for others. For those who have them, the lowest may be one, two or three, and the highest may be countable, innumerable or infinite. Among them, the asura-kumara who will be reborn as an asura-kumāra countable, innumerable or infinite times, will have future states of torment that are countable, innumerable or infinite respectively.

Just as the states of torment have been described for the asura-kumāra-avasthā, the same way the states of torment should be understood for the nāga-kumāra-avasthā and up to the vaimānika-avasthā. The idea is to understand how many past and future states of torment are there in the own-place (sva-sthāna) of the asura-kumāra, and how many states of torment are there in the other-places (para-sthāna) like the nāraka, etc. This should be understood for the nāga-kumāra and up to the vaimānikas as well, in the same way as described above.

In this way, by taking 24 danda-kas out of the 24 danda-kas, there are 1056 ālapaka, because 24 multiplied by 24 is 1056.

The kāṣāya-samudghāta, one by one, of the nāraka-avasthā of each nāraka have passed through infinite kāṣāya-samudghāta in the entire past time, and the future kāṣāya-samudghāta are present for some, and not present for others.

## Thirty-sixth Chapter on Kṣaya-Samudghāta [249]

**Those who have them, their Kṣaya-Samudghāta are one, two or three in the inferior category, and countless, innumerable or infinite in the superior category.**

**At the time of questioning, the Nārak who is present in the final stage of his existence, will, after exhausting his Nārakāyu, exit the Nārakabhavana without undergoing Kṣaya-Samudghāta and attain liberation by obtaining the Manushya-bhavana either directly or through a lineage. This means he will never return to the Nārakabhavana. Such a Nārak does not have any future Kṣaya-Samudghāta related to his Nārakaparyāya.**

**Those Nāraks who are not like this, meaning those who are destined to stay in the Nārakabhavana for a long time or those who will return to the Nārakabhavana, have future Kṣaya-Samudghāta.**

**Among them, those who have already spent a long Nārakāyu and have only a little remaining, have one, two or three Kṣaya-Samudghāta. But those whose remaining lifespan is in terms of countless years or innumerable years, or those who are destined to be born again in the Nārakabhavana, should be understood to have countless, innumerable or infinite future Kṣaya-Samudghāta respectively.**

**Each Nārak has experienced infinite Kṣaya-Samudghāta in his Asurakumāra-paryāya. The Nārak who will be born as an Asurakumāra in the future has future Kṣaya-Samudghāta related to his Asurakumāra-paryāya, and the one who will not be born as an Asurakumāra does not have them. Those who have them, may have countless, innumerable or infinite future Kṣaya-Samudghāta.**

**The countless Kṣaya-Samudghāta should be understood in relation to the Nārak who will be an Asurakumāra in the inferior state in the future, because in the inferior state, only countless Samudghāta occur. This is because there is an abundance of greed and other Kṣayās in such a state.**

**The innumerable Kṣaya-Samudghāta are said in relation to the Asurakumāra who will be born in the inferior state for a long time or multiple times.**

**The infinite Kṣaya-Samudghāta should be understood in relation to the Nārak who will be born in the Asurakumāra-paryāya an infinite number of times in the future.**

**Just as future Kṣaya-Samudghāta are mentioned in relation to the Nārak's Asurakumāra-paryāya, similarly, infinite past Kṣaya-Samudghāta should be mentioned in relation to the Nāgakumāra to the Stanitakumāra-paryāya.**

**Those who have future Kṣaya-Samudghāta, should be understood to have them in the inferior category as countless, in the superior category as innumerable or infinite.**

**The Nārak has experienced infinite past Kṣaya-Samudghāta in his Pṛthvīkāyika-paryāya, and future Kṣaya-Samudghāta are present for some, but not for others.**

**As before, they are from one onwards. This means that in the inferior category, they are one, two or three, and in the superior category, they are countless, innumerable or infinite.**

**The Nārak who exits the Nārakabhavana and becomes a Pṛthvīkāyika will have future Kṣaya-Samudghāta in this way. For example, the one who, after obtaining Kṣaya-Samudghāta from the Panchendriya-Tiryachcha-bhavana, Manushya-bhavana or Devabhavana, enters the Pṛthvīkāyika-bhavana only once, will have one Kṣaya-Samudghāta. The one who enters twice will have two, the one who enters thrice will have three, the one who enters countless times will have countless, the one who enters innumerable times will have innumerable, and the one who enters an infinite number of times will have infinite future Kṣaya-Samudghāta.**

**The Nārak who exits the Nārakabhavana and never again takes birth as a Pṛthvīkāyika does not have any future Kṣaya-Samudghāta.**

**Just as Kṣaya-Samudghāta are mentioned in relation to the Nārak's Pṛthvīkāyika form, similarly, infinite past Kṣaya-Samudghāta occur in the Nārak's Apkāyika, Tejas-kāyika, Vāyu-kāyika, Vanaspati-kāyika, Vikalendriya, Panchendriya-Tiryachcha and Manushya forms. Future Kṣaya-Samudghāta are present for some, but not for others.**

250 [The Prajñāpanā Sūtra reasoning is as before. Those who have them, their minor ones are one, two or three, and their superior ones are numerous, innumerable or infinite. As the destruction of passions in the past and future has been explained in the Asurakumāra category of Naraka, so it should be said here (in the Vaṇavyantara state). In the Jyotiṣka and Vaimānika categories of Naraka, the destruction of passions in the past is infinite, and the destruction of passions in the future is present for some, but not for others. Those who have them, their destruction of passions in the future is perhaps innumerable and perhaps infinite. Up to this point, the destruction of passions in the past and future has been explained in the form of twenty-four categories of Naraka beings. In the Asurakumāra category of Naraka, the destruction of passions in the past is infinite with respect to the entire past time, and the destruction of passions in the future is present for some, but not for others. For the Asurakumāra who has the destruction of passions in the future in the form of Naraka, it is perhaps numerous, perhaps innumerable, and perhaps infinite. In the Asurakumāra category of Asurakumāra, the destruction of passions in the past is infinite. The being who is currently in the Asurakumāra category has experienced the destruction of passions in the Asurakumāra category an infinite number of times in the past. The destruction of passions in the future is present for some, but not for others. Those who have them, their minor ones are one, two or three, and their superior ones are numerous, innumerable or infinite. Similarly, in the Nāgakumāra category, and continuously up to the Vaimānika category, the destruction of passions of Naraka should be said in the same way as for the Asurakumāra. The destruction of passions in the past and future of the Asurakumāra should be known in the same way as for the Nāgakumāra up to the Stanitakumāra, in the twenty-four categories from Naraka to Vaimānika. The special point is that in all these categories, the destruction of passions in the future should be said to be minor one, two, three, and superior numerous, innumerable or infinite. For example, the Asurakumāra category of Asurakumāras and the Nāgakumāra category of Nāgakumāras are their own categories. The remaining twenty-three categories are other categories. In the Asurakumāra category of the Pṛthvīkāyika, and continuously up to the Stanitakumāra category, the destruction of passions in the past is infinite with respect to the entire past time. The destruction of passions in the future is present for some, but not for others. Those who have them, their destruction of passions in the future is perhaps numerous, perhaps innumerable, and perhaps infinite. In the Pṛthvīkāyika category of the Pṛthvīkāyika, and continuously up to the Apkāyikatva, Tejas kāyikatva, Vāyukāyikatva, Vanaspatikāyikatva, and up to the Manusya category, the destruction of passions in the past is infinite. The destruction of passions in the future is present for some, but not for others. Those who have them, their minor ones are one, two or three, and their superior ones are numerous, innumerable or infinite. The destruction of passions in the past and future in the Vaṇavyantara state of the Pṛthvīkāyika should be understood in the same way as it has been said for the Naraka state. In the Jyotiṣka and Vaimānika categories, the destruction of passions in the past is infinite, and the destruction of passions in the future is present for some, but not for others. For the Pṛthvīkāyika who has them, their minor ones are innumerable and their superior ones are infinite. Like the Pṛthvīkāyika, it should be known in the same way for the Apkāyika in the Naraka state, Bhavanapati state, Ekendriya state, Vikalendriya state, Pañcendriya Tiryac state, and Manusya state. The statements regarding the destruction of passions of the Vaṇavyantaras, Jyotiṣkas, and Vaimānikas should be understood in the same way as for the Asurakumāras. The special point is that in their own categories, it should be said from one onwards.

## Thirty-sixth Chapter of the Accumulation of Karma [251]

**Some beings have [accumulated karma], some do not. Those who have, their least [number of accumulations] is one, two, or three, and their greatest is numerous, innumerable, or infinite.**

**Similarly, from the hellish state of the fiery-bodied, air-bodied, plant-bodied, and the disabled-sensed, to the aerial beings, the past accumulations of karma are infinite, and the future accumulations of karma are least one, two, or three, and greatest are numerous, innumerable, or infinite.**

**In this way, all these are included in the twenty-four Dandakas, in the twenty-four Dandakas.**

**Therefore, in total, there are 1056 Dandakas.**

**The accumulation of karma leading to death should be understood in the same way as the one-by-one accumulation of karma, both in the self-state and in the other-state.**

**From the hellish state to the aerial beings, in the twenty-four Dandakas, the past accumulations of karma leading to death are infinite, both in the self-state and in the other-state, such as the state of the Asura-Kumaras.**

**The meaning is that in the hellish state, the hellish state, and the other-state, such as the state of the Asura-Kumaras, and all the states up to the aerial beings, the past accumulations of karma leading to death are infinite.**

**The future accumulations of karma leading to death are present in some beings, but not in others. Those who have them, their least [number of accumulations] is one, two, or three, and their greatest is numerous, innumerable, or infinite.**

**Just as the past and future accumulations of karma leading to death have been described in the twenty-four self-states and other-states of the hellish beings, in the same way, the past, present, and future accumulations of karma leading to death should be understood in the twenty-four Dandakas, from the Asura-Kumaras to the aerial beings, in the self-states and other-states.**

**In this way, in total, there are 1056 Palapas.**

**The accumulation of karma leading to liberation should be understood in the same way as the accumulation of karma leading to bondage. The special point is that the accumulation of karma leading to liberation should not be attributed to a being who does not have the potential for liberation. It should only be attributed to those beings who have the potential for liberation.**

**Therefore, except for the air-bodied beings, the accumulation of karma leading to liberation should not be attributed to the four one-sensed beings, the plant-bodied beings, and the disabled-sensed beings, because they do not have the potential for liberation.**

**Therefore, the accumulation of karma leading to liberation should be attributed to the hellish beings, the Bhavanapatis, the air-bodied beings, the five-sensed animals, the humans, the Vanavyantara beings, the Jyotishkas, and the aerial beings.**

**In this way, it is said here: "These twenty-four Dandakas should be understood in the twenty-four Dandakas."**

**The accumulation of karma leading to liberation should also be understood in the twenty-four Dandakas, in the twenty-four Dandakas.**

**In this way, in total, there are 1056 Palapas.**

## 252] The Tejasasamuḍghāta should be known as similar to the Māranāntika-samuḍghāta / But the special feature here is that it should be stated only for the being in whom the Tejasasamuḍghāta occurs. It should not be stated for the being in whom the Tejasasamuḍghāta is not possible / It is not possible for the Nārakas, the five Ekendriyas like the Pṛthvīkāyika, and the Vikalendriyas to have Tejasasamuḍghāta, therefore it should not be stated for them / In this way, by stating the Pālapaka in the form of a rule for some and in the form of a prohibition for others, there are a total of 1056 Ālāpaka. These Pālapaka are for the statement of the twenty-four Daṇḍakas in the order of the twenty-four Daṇḍakas. Since the Prāhārakasamuḍghāta is not possible in the Nārakaparyāya of the Nārakas, there is no past Prāhārakasamuḍghāta. Similarly, there is no future Prāhārakasamuḍghāta, because the being in the Nārakaparyāya cannot obtain food, and in the absence of food, the Prāhārakasamuḍghāta cannot occur. Similarly, in the Bhavanapatīparyāya of the Asurakumāra etc., in the Ekendriyaparyāya of the Pṛthvīkāyika etc., in the Vikalendriyaparyāya, in the Pañcendriyatiryanchaparyāya, and in the Vāṇavyantara Jyotiṣka Vaimānika Paryāya, there is no future Prāhārakasamuḍghāta, because the Prāhārakasamuḍghāta is prohibited in all these Paryāyas. The special feature is that when a Nārak was in the Manusyaparyāya in the past, there are Prāhārakasamuḍghāta for some and not for others in relation to that Paryāya. For those who have it, the least is one or two and the most is three. For some Nārakas, there are future Prāhārakasamuḍghāta in the Manusyaparyāya, and for some there are not. For those who have it, the least is one, two or three and the most is four. Just as the Prāhārakasamuḍghāta has been stated for the Nārakas in the Manusyaparyāya, in the same way it should be stated for the past and future Manusyaparyāya of all beings like the Asurakumāra etc. / But in the Manusyaparyāya, there are past Prāhārakasamuḍghāta for some humans and not for others. For those who have it, there are one, two or three Prāhārakasamuḍghāta. Like the past Prāhārakasamuḍghāta, the future Prāhārakasamuḍghāta also occurs for some and not for others. For those who have it, the least is one, two or three and the most is four Prāhārakasamuḍghāta / In this way, each of these 24 Daṇḍakas should be stated in the order of the twenty-four Daṇḍakas. All these together make 1056 Ālāpaka / It should be noted that there is no Prāhārakasamuḍghāta in anyone except humans. 'Kevalisamuḍghāta - There is no past or future Kevalisamuḍghāta in the Nārakaparyāya of the Nārakas, because the Nārakas cannot perform Kevalisamuḍghāta. Similarly, there is a lack of past and future Kevalisamuḍghāta in the Vaimānikaparyāya up to the Vaimānika, because it is never possible for them to have Kevalisamuḍghāta. Yes, there is Kevalisamuḍghāta in the Manusyaparyāya of the Nārakas etc., but even in that, there is no past Kevalisamuḍghāta. Future Kevalisamuḍghāta occurs in the Manusyaparyāya of some Nārakas, and not for others. For those who have it, there is only one. In the Manusyaparyāya of humans, there is past and future Kevalisamuḍghāta for some and not for others. For those who have it, there is only one. In this way, in all self-other-places except the Manusyaparyāya, the absence of Kevalisamuḍghāta should be stated / This 1. Prajñāpanā. Malayavṛtti, Abhi. Rā. Koṣa, Bhā. 7, p. 443

[Thirty-sixth Chapter]  The twenty-four Dandakas related to the Kevali-Samudghāt are each divided into twenty-four Dandakas. These are all the total 1056 pronouncements of the rules and prohibitions. The twenty-four Dandakas are divided into twenty-four Dandaka-Paryayas, with respect to multiplicity, the past, etc., Samudghāt-Prarūpaṇā 2121. [1] "Bhagavan! How many Vedana-Samudghātas have been experienced by the many Narakas while they were in the Naraka-Paryaya?" [2121-1 Q] "Gautama! They have been infinite." [2121-1 A] "Bhagavan! How many (Vedana-Samudghātas) are there in the future (for the Narakas)?" [2121-1 A] "Gautama! They are infinite." In the same way, up to the Vaimānika-Paryaya (both the past and the future are infinite). [2] In the same way, for all beings, up to the Vaimānika-Paryaya of the Vaimānikas (it should be said). [2121-2] 2122. In the same way, up to the Tejas-Samudghāta-Paryaya (it should be said). It should be understood by applying special usage that (it should be said) for those who have the possibility of Vaikriya and Tejas-Samudghāta. [2121-2] 2123. [1] "Bhagavan! How many Āhāraka-Samudghātas have been experienced by the many Narakas while they were in the Naraka-Paryaya?" [2123-1 Q] "Gautama! Not a single one." [2123-1 A] "Bhagavan! How many (Āhāraka-Samudghātas) are there in the future (for the Narakas)?" [2123-1 A] "Gautama! There are none." [2] In the same way, up to the Vaimānika-Paryaya (it should be said about the past and future Āhāraka-Samudghātas).

[Thirty-sixth Chapter] [255. Q.] O Bhagavan! How many are the future (Kevali-Samudghāt) of (humans)? [A.] Gautama! They are perhaps countable and perhaps uncountable. [4] And these twenty-four Danda-kas should be told in accordance with the question, as far as the Vaimanika-s in the Vaimanika-parāya. [2124-4] Thus, in these twenty-four Danda-kas, by enacting twenty-four Danda-kas, as per the question, as far as the Vaimanika-s in the Vaimanika-parāya, it should be said. / The discussion of the past and future Vedana-ādi Samudghāt of each Nairāyika-ādi in their Nairāthika-ādi parāya was done earlier in relation to the multiplicity. Now, the discussion of the past and future Vedana-ādi Samudghāt is being done in relation to the multiplicity, while staying in the respective parāya of Naraka-ādi. (1) The past Vedana-Samudghāt are infinite while staying in the Naraka-parāya of the five Vedana-ādi Samudghāt-Naraka-s, because many Naraka-s have passed through an infinite period of time, which has come out of the Avyavahāra-rāśi. Similarly, their future Vedana-Samudghāt are also infinite, because many of the Naraka-s who are in the present time will be born again in Naraka for an infinite number of times. The Vedana-Samudghāt are said to be in the Naraka-parāya of the Naraka-s, in the same way, in the Bhavanapati-parāya of Asura-kumāra-ādi, in the Ekaindriya-parāya of Pṛthvīkāyika-ādi, in the Vikalendriya-parāya, in the Pañcendriya-tiryañc-parāya, in the Manusya-parāya, in the Vāṇavyantara-parāya, in the Jyotiṣka-parāya, and in the Vaimanika-parāya, that is, while staying in all these parāya-s, the past and future Vedana-Samudghāt of the Naraka-s are infinite. Like the Naraka-s, the past and future Vedana-Samudghāt of the Asura-kumāra-ādi Bhavanapati-s to the Vaimanika-s, while staying in the Naraka-parāya to the Vaimanika-parāya, should be told. That is, like the Naraka-s, the past and future Vedana-Samudghāt of all beings in their own place and in other places (in twenty-four Danda-kas) should be told. / Thus, the speakers of the Vedana-Samudghāt related to the plural are a total of 1056. Like the Vedana-Samudghāt, the past and future Kṣaya, Māranāntika, Vaikriya, and Tejas-Samudghāt should also be told from the Naraka-s to the Vaimanika-s and from the Naraka-parāya to the Vaimanika-parāya in twenty-four Danda-kas. Thus, each of the Kṣaya-Samudghāt, etc., also has 1056 speakers. Special information - The Samudghāt which are possible in which (where) should be told as the past and future Samudghāt, using the application, that is, keeping in mind. / This means that the Samudghāt which are not possible in which (where) should not be told in that (where). / This is explained by saying - Uvaujjīūṇ yanvṁ, jass'asthi veuvṁviy-teyaga- That is, the Vaikriya and Tejas-Samudghāt should be told only in those Naraka-ādi where they are possible. They should not be told in Pṛthvīkāyika-ādi, because they are not possible in them. / Past and future

The statement regarding *Kshaya-samudghāt* and *Māraṇāntika-samudghāt* in the *Prajñāpanā-sūtra* should be stated in the same way as the statement regarding *Vedana-samudghāt*, universally. *Āhāraka-samudghāt* does not occur in the past or future for beings in the hell realm. This is because *Āhāraka-samudghāt* arises only from the *Āhāraka-śarīra*, and the *Āhāraka-śarīra* exists only when *Āhāraka-kalabdhi* is present. *Āhāraka-kalabdhi* is attained only by the fourteen *Pūrva-dhara* monks, and the knowledge of the fourteen *Pūrvas* can only be attained in the human realm, not in any other realm. Therefore, there is no *Āhāraka-samudghāt* in the past or future in all realms other than the human realm. For example, *Āhāraka-samudghāt* is not possible in the hell realm for beings in the hell realm. Similarly, *Āhāraka-samudghāt* in the past or future for beings in the hell realm is not possible in the *Asura-kumāra* and other *Bhavana-pati* realms, the *Pṛthvī-kāyika* and other *Eka-indriya* realms, the *Vikala-indriya* realms, the *Tiryak-pañca-indriya* realms, and the *Vāṇa-vyantara-jyotiṣka-vaimānika* realms, according to the aforementioned reasoning. 

**Special Note:** There are countless *Āhāraka-samudghāt* in the past and future for beings in the human realm. This is because, at the time of questioning, there are countless beings in hell who had attained the human realm in the past, who were knowers of the fourteen *Pūrvas*, and who had performed *Āhāraka-samudghāt* once or twice or thrice. Therefore, countless *Āhāraka-samudghāt* in the past are said to have occurred for beings in the human realm. Similarly, at the time of questioning, there are countless beings in hell who will attain the human realm in the future, either immediately or through a series of births, who will become holders of the fourteen *Pūrvas*, who will attain *Āhāraka-kalabdhi*, and who will perform *Āhāraka-samudghāt*. Therefore, countless *Āhāraka-samudghāt* in the future are said to have occurred for beings in the human realm. 

**Special Note:** For beings from *Asura-kumāra* to *Vaimānika*, in all twenty-four *Daṇḍakas*, *Āhāraka-samudghāt* should be prohibited in their respective realms (except for the human realm). 

**Special Note:** For beings in the *Vanaspati-kāyika* realm, *Āhāraka-samudghāt* in the past and future should be said to be infinite. This is because there are infinite beings who had studied the fourteen *Pūrvas* in the human realm and who had performed *Āhāraka-samudghāt* once or twice or thrice, but who are now in the *Vanaspati-kāyika* realm. There are also infinite beings who will emerge from the *Vanaspati-kāyika* realm, attain the human realm, and perform *Āhāraka-samudghāt* in the future. 

For humans in the human realm, *Āhāraka-samudghāt* in the past before the time of questioning is possibly countable and possibly uncountable. Similarly, *Āhāraka-samudghāt* in the future for humans in the human realm is possibly countable and possibly uncountable. This is because, at the time of questioning, they are in the highest category, or in the lowest category, or in a fraction of the uncountable number of regions of space. Therefore, at the time of questioning, it should be understood as possibly uncountable. And, since each person has performed *Āhāraka-samudghāt* once or twice or thrice, or will do so, it is also possibly countable. 

For all beings other than humans, from *Asura-kumāra* onwards, the statement should be understood in the same way as for beings in the hell realm.

The thirty-sixth chapter of the **Samudghāt** [257] states that each of the twenty-four **Daṇḍakas** should be applied to the twenty-four **Daṇḍakas**. This results in a total of 1056 **Pālapakas**. In the **Nārak** realm of **Kevalisamudghāt**, there is no past or future **Kevalisamudghāt** because **Kevalisamudghāt** can only occur in the human state. It is not possible in any other state. A being who has achieved **Kevalisamudghāt** does not wander in the cycle of existence because **Moksha** is attained within a **muhūrta** after **Kevalisamudghāt**. Therefore, there is no past or future **Kevalisamudghāt** in the **Nārak** realm, which is different from the human state. Similarly, from the **Asura-kumāra** realm to the **Vāimānika** realm (excluding the human realm), there cannot be any past **Kevalisamudghāt**. The implication is that those who have achieved **Kevalisamudghāt** in the human state do not reside in **Nārak**. Therefore, past **Kevalisamudghāt** is not possible even in the human state. Among the **Nārakas** existing in the present time, countless are eligible for **Moksha**. From this perspective, future **Kevalisamudghāt** is considered countless. Similarly, in the realms of **Asura-kumāra** and other **Bhavana-patis**, as well as the **Pṛthvīkāyika** and other four **Ekaindriya** realms (excluding plants), the three **Vikalaindriya** realms, the five-sense **Tiryāñca** realms, the **Vāṇavyantara** realms, the **Jyotiṣka** realms, and the **Vāimānika** realms, there cannot be any past or future **Kevalisamudghāt** in realms other than the human realm. Plants cannot have past **Kevalisamudghāt** in the human state because they attain liberation in the same existence after **Kevalisamudghāt**, making it impossible for them to be born as plants again. However, future **Kevalisamudghāt** is infinite. This is because among the plant beings existing in the present time, there are countless beings who will leave the plant state and attain **Siddhi** through **Kevalisamudghāt** in the next existence or through tradition. Humans may or may not have past **Kevalisamudghāt** in the human state. When many humans have achieved **Kevalisamudghāt** and attained liberation, and no other **Kevali** has achieved **Kevalisamudghāt**, then the absence of **Kevalisamudghāt** should be understood. When **Kevalisamudghāt** occurs in the human realm of humans and there are excellent **Shat-Pṛthaktva** (from two hundred to nine hundred), then future **Kevalisamudghāt** may be countable or uncountable. In the present time, there may be countable or uncountable humans who will achieve **Kevalisamudghāt** in the human state in the future. These twenty-four **Daṇḍakas** are of this type, in which past and future **Kevalisamudghāt** are discussed. All of these together constitute 1056 **Ālapakas**. These **Pālapakas** should be spoken in their respective places from the **Nārayika** realm to the **Vāimānika** realm. 1. (a) **Prajñāpanā**. **Malayavṛtti**, **Abhi**. **Rā.

[Thirty-sixth Samudyatapad] (261) Gotama! The number of humans who are bound by the Paharaka-samudghāt is countless, the number of humans who are bound by the Kevali-samudghāt is countless, the number of humans who are bound by the Tejas-samudghāt is countless, the number of humans who are bound by the Vaikriya-samudghāt is countless, the number of humans who are bound by the Māranantika-samudghāt is innumerable, the number of humans who are bound by the Vedana-samudghāt is innumerable, the number of humans who are bound by the Kasaya-samudghāt is countless, and the number of humans who are not bound by any of these is innumerable. [2131]  Question:  O Bhagavan! Among humans who are bound by Vedana-samudghāt, Kasaya-samudghāt, Māranantika-samudghāt, Vaikriya-samudghāt, Tejas-samudghāt, Paharaka-samudghāt, and Kevali-samudghāt, who are fewer, who are more, who are equal, and who are superior?  /  [2131]  Answer:  Gotama! The fewest are those who are bound by the Āhāraka-samudghāt. Those who are bound by the Kevali-samudghāt are countless times more than them. Those who are bound by the Tejas-samudghāt are countless times more than them. Those who are bound by the Vaikriya-samudghāt are countless times more than them. Those who are bound by the Māranantika-samudghāt are innumerable times more than them. Those who are bound by the Vedana-samudghāt are innumerable times more than them. And those who are bound by the Kasaya-samudghāt are countless times more than them. And those who are not bound by any of these are innumerable times more than all of them.  /  2132.  (The statement about the relative abundance of the different samudghāts) is like the Asura-kumāras, the Vāṇamantara-Jyotishi-Vēmaṇiya. [2132]  The reason for the relative abundance of the different samudghāts is that those who are bound by the Āhāraka-samudghāt are the fewest because the duration of the Āhāraka-śarīra is said to be six months.  /  Therefore, they may not even exist at some times.  /  When they do exist, they are only one, two, or three in number, or at most a thousand.  Furthermore, the Āhāraka-samudghāt occurs only at the beginning of the Paharaka-śarīra, not at other times.  Therefore, those who are bound by the Paharaka-samudghāt are also said to be few.  Those who are bound by the Kevali-samudghāt are countless times more than those who are bound by the Āhāraka-samudghāt because they exist in hundreds at a time.  Those who are bound by the Tejas-samudghāt are innumerable times more than them because the Tejas-samudghāt is found in the five-sense Tiryanchas, humans, and the four types of Devas.  Those who are bound by the Vaikriya-samudghāt are innumerable times more than them because the Vaikriya-samudghāt is found in the Narakas, Vāyu-kāyikas, five-sense Tiryanchas, humans, and Devas.  The Vāyu-kāyika beings who have attained Vaikriya are innumerable times more than the Devas, and the Vāyu-kāyika beings who are capable of flying are innumerable times more than the terrestrial five-sense Tiryanchas, and the terrestrial five-sense Tiryanchas are innumerable times more than the Devas.  /  Therefore, those who are bound by the Vaikriya-samudghāt should be understood to be innumerable times more than those who are bound by the Tejas-samudghāt.

## Translation:

**262]**  According to the **Prajñāpanā Sūtra**, beings with **Vāikriya-samudghāta** are infinitely more numerous than those with **Māraṇāntika-samudghāta**. This is because an immeasurable portion of the infinite beings in **Nigoda** are always in the state of **Vigraha-gati** and are frequently associated with **Māraṇāntika-samudghāta**.

Beings with **Kaṣāya-samudghāta** are infinitely more numerous than those with **Māraṇāntika-samudghāta**, because even compared to the infinite beings in **Nigoda** who have attained **Vigraha-gati**, an immeasurable number of **Nigoda** beings are always found to be associated with **Kaṣāya-samudghāta**.

Beings with **Vedana-samudghāta** are slightly more numerous than those with **Kaṣāya-samudghāta**, because there are only a few more beings with **Vedana-samudghāta** than the infinite **Nigoda** beings with **Kaṣāya-samudghāta**.

Beings without any **samudghāta** (i.e., those who are not associated with any **samudghāta**) are infinitely more numerous than those with **Vedana-samudghāta**, because compared to beings with **Vedana**, **Kaṣāya**, and **Māraṇāntika-samudghāta**, the **Nigoda** beings alone who are free from **samudghāta** are found to be infinitely more numerous.

Among **Nāraka** beings, the least numerous due to **samudghāta** are those with **Māraṇāntika-samudghāta**, because **Māraṇāntika-samudghāta** occurs only at the time of death, and the number of **Nāraka** beings who die is less than those who are alive. Even among those who die, only a very few have **Māraṇāntika-samudghāta**, not all. Therefore, beings with **Māraṇāntika-samudghāta** are the least numerous.

**Nāraka** beings with **Vāikriya-samudghāta** are infinitely more numerous than those with **Māraṇāntika-samudghāta**, because in each of the seven **Nāraka** realms, such as **Ratna-prabhā**, many **Nāraka** beings constantly engage in **Uttara-vāikriya** to inflict pain on each other.

**Nāraka** beings with **Kaṣāya-samudghāta** are infinitely more numerous than those with **Vāikriya-samudghāta**, because they are always afflicted by **Krodha** (anger) and other **Kaṣāya** (passions).

**Nāraka** beings with **Vedana-samudghāta** are innumerably more numerous than those with **Kaṣāya-samudghāta**, because due to **Kṣetra-janya-vedanā** (pain arising from the body), pain inflicted by **Paramādhāmika** beings, and pain inflicted on each other, many **Nāraka** beings are constantly associated with **Vedana-samudghāta**.

Even compared to these, **Nāraka** beings without any **samudghāta** are innumerably more numerous, because many **Nāraka** beings experience pain even without **Vedana-samudghāta**.

Compared to all these, **Nāraka** beings without any **samudghāta** are the most numerous.

Among **Asura-kumāra** and other **Bhavana-pati** beings, the least numerous due to **samudghāta** are those with **Taijasa-samudghāta**, because only occasionally, when extreme anger arises, does an **Asura-kumāra** experience **Taijasa-samudghāta**.

**Asura-kumāra** and other beings with **Māraṇāntika-samudghāta** are infinitely more numerous than those with **Taijasa-samudghāta**, because **Māraṇāntika-samudghāta** occurs at the time of death.

**Asura-kumāra** and other beings with **Vedana-samudghāta** are infinitely more numerous than those with **Māraṇāntika-samudghāta**, because due to various reasons, such as mutual battles, many **Asura-kumāra** beings experience **Vedana-samudghāta**.

**Asura** beings with **Kaṣāya-samudghāta** and **Vāikriya-samudghāta** are infinitely more numerous than those with **Vedana-samudghāta**.

The Nagakumaras, etc., up to the Stanitakumaras, should be understood in the same way as the Asura Kumaras, etc., as stated by the Bhavanapati Devas.

The number of Earth-bodied beings, etc., with four senses, is less than the number of those who experience the various types of Samudghata, with the least number being those who experience the Maranantak Samudghata. There are four Earth-bodied beings (excluding the Air-bodied beings) who experience the Maranantak Samudghata, because this Samudghata occurs only at the time of death, and even then, it occurs only in some and not in others. The Earth-bodied beings who experience the Kashaya Samudghata should be understood in the same way as the Earth-bodied beings who experience the Maranantak Samudghata, as explained earlier. The Earth-bodied beings who experience the Vedana Samudghata are more numerous than those who experience the Maranantak Samudghata, and the Earth-bodied beings, etc., who do not experience any of these Samudghata are innumerable times more than them.

Among the Air-bodied beings, the least number are those who experience the Vaikriya Samudghata, because the Air-bodied beings who have attained Vaikriya are very few. The Air-bodied beings who experience the Maranantak Samudghata are innumerable times more than them, because the Maranantak Samudghata can occur in all Air-bodied beings, whether they have attained Vaikriya or not, whether they are Parayapta, Aparayapta, Badara, or Sukshma. The Air-bodied beings who experience the Kashaya Samudghata are innumerable times more than those who experience the Maranantak Samudghata, and the Air-bodied beings who experience the Vedana Samudghata are more numerous than those who experience the Kashaya Samudghata. The Air-bodied beings who do not experience any of these Samudghata are innumerable times more than all of them, because the Air-bodied beings who are in their natural state are naturally innumerable times more than those who experience all the Samudghata.

Among the beings with two senses, etc., the least number are those who experience the Maranantak Samudghata, because only those with two senses who are in the state of Prati-niyat are found to experience the Maranantak Samudghata at the time of death. The beings with two senses who experience the Vedana Samudghata are innumerable times more than them, because the Vedana Samudghata occurs in a large number of beings with two senses due to contact with cold, heat, etc. The beings with two senses who experience the Kashaya Samudghata are numerous times more than those who experience the Vedana Samudghata, because the Kashaya Samudghata occurs in a large number of beings with two senses due to the Kashayas of greed, etc. The beings with two senses who do not experience any of these Samudghata are numerous times more than all of them, as explained earlier.

The beings with three senses and four senses should be understood in the same way as the beings with two senses, in terms of the number of those who experience the various types of Samudghata and those who do not.

Among the five-sensed Tiryanchas, the least number are those who experience the Taijasa Samudghata, because the attainment of Taijasa is very rare. The five-sensed Tiryanchas who experience the Vaikriya Samudghata are innumerable times more than them, because the attainment of Vaikriya is relatively more common. The five-sensed Tiryanchas who experience the Maranantak Samudghata are innumerable times more than those who experience the Vaikriya Samudghata, because the Maranantak Samudghata occurs in all five-sensed Tiryanchas, whether they have attained Vaikriya or not, including the submerged aquatic animals, terrestrial animals, and aerial animals, who are in a state of Sammuchchhima. The Maranantak Samudghata is more common than the Vaikriya Samudghata in these beings. 1. Prajnapana, Malayavritti, Abhidhana Ratnakosa, Bha. 7, p. 446 2. (a) Ibid., Malayavritti, Pra. Ra.

[264] The Prajñāpanā Sūtra states that there are countless types of samvahata (simultaneous) karma. Even in the case of ghabhanja (a type of rebirth), some are accompanied by vaikriya labdhi (the ability to perform actions) and some are not. Even compared to those, there are countless types of samvahata karma that are accompanied by vedanā samudghāta (the ripening of karma that causes pain), because there are countless times more beings who are not dying than those who are. Even compared to those, there are countless types of samvahata karma that are accompanied by kaṣāya samudghāta (the ripening of karma that causes passions) in the five-sense beings of the tiriyānca (animal) realm. And compared to all of these, there are countless types of asamvahata (non-simultaneous) karma in the five-sense beings of the tiriyānca realm, as explained above.

Among humans, the least common type of samudghāta (ripening of karma) is that which is accompanied by āhārak samudghāta (the ripening of karma that causes the need for food), because there are very few humans who begin their existence with an āhārak body. There are countless times more humans who are accompanied by kevali samudghāta (the ripening of karma that causes liberation), because they are found in the number of śatapṛthaktva (two hundred to nine hundred). Compared to them, there are countless times more humans who are accompanied by taijasa samudghāta (the ripening of karma that causes a luminous body), vaikriya samudghāta (the ripening of karma that causes the ability to perform actions), and māranāntika samudghāta (the ripening of karma that causes death), respectively. This is because there are more humans who are accompanied by māranāntika samudghāta than the previous two, as it is also found in the sammūcchima (those who are about to die) humans. Compared to them, there are countless times more humans who are accompanied by vedanā samudghāta, because there are countless times more humans who are not dying than those who are, and vedanā samudghāta also occurs in humans who are not dying. Compared to them, there are countless times more humans who are accompanied by kaṣāya samudghāta. And compared to all of these, there are countless times more humans who are asamvahata (not accompanied by any of these samudghātas), because there are always countless times more humans who have less kaṣāya (passions) and are sammūcchima than those who have strong kaṣāya.

The relative frequency of samudghāta in vāṇavyantara (those who live in the sky), jyotiṣka (those who have a luminous body), and vaimānika (those who travel in aerial vehicles) should be understood in the same way as in the case of asurakumāra (demigods).

[2133] How many types of kaṣāya samudghāta are there, Bhante?

[2133] Gautama, there are four types of kaṣāya samudghāta: (1) krodha samudghāta (the ripening of karma that causes anger), (2) māna samudghāta (the ripening of karma that causes pride), (3) māyā samudghāta (the ripening of karma that causes deceit), and (4) lobha samudghāta (the ripening of karma that causes greed).

[2134] How many types of kaṣāya samudghāta are there in the naraka (hell) beings, Bhante?

[2134] Gautama, all four types of kaṣāya samudghāta are found in them.

Similarly, in the case of māṇasamuddhāt and māyāsamuddhāt, the entire description (as mentioned in Su. 2116) should be said like the māraṇāntikasamuddhāt /  The description of lobhasamuddhāt (as mentioned in Su. 2105-15) should be done like the kaṣāyasamuddhāt.  The special thing is that the manifestation of lobhakaṣāya samuddhāt in the narakaparyāya of all beings, starting from asurakumāra, should be done one by one /  2140.

[2141] In the same way, in all the svathāna-parasthanas, the four samuddhāt of all beings, starting from krodhasamuddhāt up to lobhasamuddhāt, should be described while they are in the vaimānikaparyāya of the vaimānikas.

[From Prajnapana 2144-1] Gautama! The Asura Kumaras who are associated with the least amount of anger-arousal are the fewest in number, those associated with mind-arousal are many times more numerous, those associated with illusion-arousal are many times more numerous than those associated with mind-arousal, and those associated with greed-arousal are many times more numerous than those associated with illusion-arousal, and those who are not associated with any of these are many times more numerous than all of them. [2] And so it is with the Vaimanikas. [2144-2] In the same way, one should explain the relative scarcity and abundance of anger-arousal and other such arousal among all the Devas, up to the Vaimanikas. 2145. [1] The question of the Earth-dwellers. Gotama! In all cases, the Earth-dwellers who are associated with mind-arousal are the fewest in number, those associated with anger-arousal are more numerous, those associated with illusion-arousal are more numerous than those associated with anger-arousal, and those associated with greed-arousal are more numerous than those associated with illusion-arousal, and those who are not associated with any of these are many times more numerous. [2145-1 Pra] Bhagavan! Among the Earth-dwellers, who are more numerous, fewer, equal, or special, in relation to those associated with anger-arousal and those who are not associated with it? [2145-1 U] Gautama! The Earth-dwellers who are associated with the least amount of mind-arousal are the fewest in number, those associated with anger-arousal are more numerous, those associated with illusion-arousal are more numerous than those associated with anger-arousal, and those associated with greed-arousal are more numerous than those associated with illusion-arousal, and those who are not associated with any of these are many times more numerous. / [2] And so it is with the five-sense beings and the Tiryanchas. [2145-2] In the same way, one should understand the relative scarcity and abundance of these up to the five-sense beings and the Tiryanchas. 2146. Humans are like all other beings (Su. 2142) /  There are countless times more humans who are associated with mind-arousal. [2146] The collection of humans is like all other beings (as explained in Su. 2142) /  The special thing is that there are countless times more humans who are associated with mind-arousal. /  Discussion-Conclusion-First, the four types of kṣaya-arousal and the existence of all four types of kṣayas in the twenty-four danda-kas, from the Nairyika to the Vaimanika, have been described. Then, in the twenty-four danda-kas, the past and future of the four types of arousal, anger, etc., in relation to oneness and multiplicity, have been described. From the Naraka to the Vaimanika, each has an infinite past of anger-arousal, etc., and each has a future of anger-arousal, etc., which some have and some do not. Those who are in the last stage of the Naraka, etc., and who are naturally slow-kṣayī, will die without experiencing kṣaya-arousal, and will be reborn in the human realm after leaving the Naraka, and will become a Siddha without experiencing kṣaya-arousal. They will not have any future kṣaya-arousal. Those who are different from them...

[Thirty-sixth Samudhatapad] [There are 269 types of Naraka, their future Kshaya Samudghāt are of three types: Jghanya (inferior), one, two or three; and Utkrishta (superior), countless and infinite. Those who remain in the world for a countable period have countable, those who remain for countless period have countless, and those who remain for infinite period have infinite future Kshaya Samudghāt. In terms of plurality, from Narakas to Vaimanikas, the past and future Krodha Madghāt are infinite. The future is infinite because at the time of the tail, there are many Narakas, etc., who will remain in the world for an infinite period. Thus, there are four speakers for each of the twenty-four Dandakas related to singular and plural. Thus, in total, there are 24 x 4 = 66 speakers. After this, the Niryaik, etc., synonyms related to the twenty-four Dandakas have been described in terms of unity and plurality, with respect to the past and future Krodha, etc., Kshaya Samudghāt.  /  /  In Narakas, who are constantly distressed in extreme intense pain, there is usually no Lobha Samudghāt.  /  Even if there is, it is very less. After this, the Samavahata and Asamavahata aggregates of living beings and the twenty-four Dandaka-related living beings, with respect to Krodha, Mana, Maya and Lobha Samudghāt, have been discussed in terms of their small plurality. Discussion and explanation of small plurality - (1) Samuccaya Jivas are the least Samavahata Jivas with Akashaya Samudghāt. Akashaya Samudghāt means - Samavahata with any one of the six Samudghāt, which are different from or devoid of Kshaya Samudghāt.  /  Samavahata Jivas with Akashaya Samudghāt are rarely found.  /  Even if they are in superior numbers, they are only the infiniteth part of the Kshaya Samudghāt Samavahata Jivas. Compared to them, the Mana Samudghāt Samavahata Jivas are infinitely more. Because, due to the impressions of the previous birth, infinite Vanaspatikayika Jivas remain in the present in Mana Samudghāt. Compared to them, Krodha Samudghāt Samavahata Jivas are more special; because, compared to Mani Jivas, Krodhi Jivas are more special.  /  Compared to them, Maya Samudghāt Samavahata Jivas are more special.  /  Compared to them, Lobha Samudghāt Samavahata Jivas are more special, because compared to Maya Jivas, Lobhi Jivas are much more. Compared to them, Asamavahata Jivas are countless times more. Because, in all the four gatis, the number of Samudghāt-free Jivas is countless times more than the number of Samudghāt-filled Jivas. Siddha Jivas are the infiniteth part of the Ekendriya, but they are not intended here.  /  (2) Small plurality of Kshaya Samudghāt in Narakas - Lobha Samudghāt is the least in Narakas, because Narakas do not get the association of beloved things. Therefore, even if there is Lobha Samudghāt in them, it is very less than other Krodha, etc., Samudghāt. Compared to them, Maya Samudghāt, Mana Samudghāt, Krodha Samudghāt are progressively more in countless numbers.  /  Asamavahata Narakas are countless times more than all of them.  /  (3) Small plurality of Kshaya Samudghāt in Asura Kumar, etc. - Devas naturally have an abundance of Lobha. From that, there is a progressive decrease in Mana Kshaya, Krodha Kshaya and Maya Kshaya.  /  Therefore, Asura Kumar, etc., Bhavanapati Devas have been described as having the least Krodha Samudghāt, and progressively more Mana, Maya and Lobha Samavahata, and the most countless times more Asamavahata Asura Kumar.

[270] In the Earth-bodied beings, the number of those with a low degree of *kṣaya* (passions) is very small, while the number of those with anger, delusion, and greed is very high. The number of those who are not *samvṛta* (covered) is even higher. The same should be understood for other beings with one sense, two senses, etc., and five senses. In humans, the *kṣaya* outburst should be understood as similar to the beings with a low degree of *samvṛta* (covered). However, there is one special thing, that is, the number of humans who are *samvṛta* (covered) due to *kṣaya* outburst is much less than the number of humans who are *samvṛta* (covered) due to *manas* (mind) outburst. Because humans have an abundance of *manas* (mind). In the twenty-four *daṇḍakas* (sections), the *chādmāsthika* outburst is described as follows: 2147. How many *chādmāsthika* outbursts are there, O Lord? [2147 A.] Gautam! There are six *chādmāsthika* outbursts.

[2148 Q.] How many *chādmāsthika* outbursts are there in the *naraka* (hell), O Lord? [2148 A.] Gautam! There are four *chādmāsthika* outbursts in the *naraka* (hell).

[2146 A.] Gautam! There are five *chādmāsthika* outbursts in the *asurakumāra* (demigods).

[272] [In the Prajnapana Sutra, three types of samudghata are found / In the Vayu Kayikas, Vaikriya samudghata is more prevalent. In humans, only six types of Chanasthika samudghata are found.] The field, time and action of the Jiva, etc., which are associated with the Vedana and Kashaya samudghata, are described in Praruprana 2153. [1] "O Bhagavan! The Jiva, who is associated with the Vedana samudghata, while being associated with it, expels the Pudgalas (from his body). Bhagavan! How much field is filled by those Pudgalas and how much field is touched by them?" [2153-1 U.] "Gautama! In accordance with the rule, the field of the body, in terms of its extent (Vishkambha) and thickness (Bahalya), fills the six directions. This much field is filled and this much field is touched."

**[273 - 2153.4]**  O Bhagavan!  Those who are struck by the outgoing pudgalas, those who are afflicted, those who are tormented, those who are slightly affected, those who are gathered together, those who are brought together, those who are distressed, those who are fainted, and those who are killed, O Bhagavan! How many actions does the jiva have because of them?

**[2153-4]** Gautama! He may have three actions, he may have four actions, and he may have five actions.

**[5]** O Bhagavan! How many actions do those jivas have because of that jiva?

**[2153-5]** Gautama! They may have three actions, they may have four actions, and they may have five actions.

**[6]** O Bhagavan! How many actions do that jiva and those jivas have because of the destruction of other jivas by tradition?

**[2153-6]** Gautama! They may have three actions, they may have four actions, and they may have five actions.

**[2154.1]** O Bhagavan! How much area is filled and how much area is touched by the pudgalas that the naraka expels from his body due to the vedanasamudghāta, while he is in the state of samoh?  And so on, all the questions as before?

**[2154-1]** Gautama! As it was said about the samuccaya jiva (in 2153/1-2-3-4-5-6), so it should be said here. The difference is that here the word 'naraka' should be used in place of 'jiva'.

**[2]**  As it was said about the samuccaya jiva, so it should be said about all the twenty-four danda-kos, up to the vaimanika.

**[2155]** In the same way (as the vedanasamudghāta), the kasayasamudghāta should also be described (in detail).

## Translation:

**[274] In the Praśāpanā Sūtra, the characteristics of the field, time, and action related to the non-discriminatory pain and the outburst of passions are discussed. In this present case, six points related to the outburst of pain are discussed: **

**(1) How much area is filled and touched (pervaded) by the pudgalas that are expelled from the body?**

**(2) How long does it take for that area to be expelled from the living being's atma-pradeshas (regions of the soul) in how much time?**

**(3) How many actions does the living being who is causing the outburst of pain take to inflict harm on the beings, ghosts, living beings, and entities that remain in that area?**

**(4) How many actions do those living beings take due to that living being?**

**(5) How many actions do that living being and those living beings take due to harming other living beings traditionally?**

**Difficult words and their meanings:**

* **Niśśabhati:** Expels from the body.
* **Aphuṇeāpūrṇa:** Filled.
* **Fuḍe:** Touched.
* **Vikkhamba:** Extension and thickness.
* **Abhihaṇanti:** Inflict harm, strike from the front.
* **Vatteti:** Cause to revolve, make dizzy.
* **Lesenti:** Touch slightly.
* **Saṅghāenti:** Gather together in a group.
* **Saṅghaṭṭeti:** Crush together.
* **Pariyāti:** Burn.
* **Kilāti:** Tire, or make unconscious.
* **Uddati:** Frighten, or make lifeless.

**Solutions to the six questions:**

**(1) The living being who is experiencing the outburst of pain, the pudgalas that are expelled from his body, are the size of the body in terms of extension and thickness. They pervade all six directions according to the rule. That is, the pudgalas fill and touch an area equal to the extension and thickness of the body.**

**(2) The area that is the size of the body, in terms of extension and thickness, is filled and touched by the pain-producing pudgalas, as far as the area is pervaded, with the speed of disintegration of one, two, or three times. The meaning is that the area that is pervaded by the disintegration of three times at the most, is filled by the pain-producing pudgalas that are expelled from the atma-pradeshas. That area is filled and touched in the same amount of time.**

**(3) The living being expels those pain-producing pudgalas in a time slightly longer than the lowest antarmuhūrta and the highest antarmuhūrta. The meaning is that just as a person suffering from a severe fever expels subtle pudgalas from the body, in the same way, the living being experiencing the outburst of pain, expels the pain-producing pudgalas from the atma-pradeshas in the lowest and highest antarmuhūrta time, suffering from pain.**

**(4) Those expelled pudgalas cause harm to beings, such as the two-sense, three-sense, and four-sense living beings, like leeches, ants, flies, etc., ghosts, such as plant-bodied living beings, living beings, such as five-sense animals, like lizards, snakes, etc., and entities, such as earth-bodied, water-bodied, fire-bodied, and air-bodied beings, due to which the pain...**

## Thirty-Second Opening Chapter

**[275]** A being who causes pain to another being may have three, four, or five actions. The intention is that when he does not cause pain to any being, nor kills them, he has three actions. When he causes pain to some beings, or kills them, but does not cause any obstruction to those who are not harmed, he has three actions more than those who are not harmed. When he causes pain to someone, he has four actions, and when he kills some beings, he has five actions more than those who are not harmed.

**(5)** Beings who are touched by the karmic particles of a being who causes pain, are three, four, or five actions more than the being who causes pain. When they are not able to cause any obstruction to the being who causes pain, they have three actions. When they clearly cause pain to that being who is associated with pain, they have four actions. Scorpions, etc., who touch the body, are painful, this is directly known. But when those beings who are clearly seen, deprive him of life, they have five actions. Snakes, etc., who touch the body, are deadly by their bite, this is also directly known. These five actions are: (1) bodily, (2) authoritative, (3) verbal, (4) painful, and (5) life-taking.

**(6)** Briefly, the being who receives pain, and the beings who are touched by the karmic particles related to the being who receives pain, are three, four, or five actions more than the other beings, due to the traditional killing of other beings, according to the above statement.

These six facts related to causing pain should be stated in all twenty-four Dandakas, from the Nairyaika to the Vaimanika. The statement related to causing passion should be known in the same way as the above statement about causing pain.

**[2156]** **[1]** "O Venerable One! What is the extent of the field, time, and action of the being, etc., associated with the killing-ending opening chapter?"

"O Venerable One! In what field are the karmic particles, which are attached to the being who is associated with the killing-ending opening chapter, unmanifest, and in what field are they manifest?"

"O Venerable One! The karmic particles are unmanifest in a field that is as small as the size of a body, and manifest in a field that is as large as the size of a body, in terms of its width, length, and height. The width is as small as an inch, and the length and height are as large as countless yojanas. The karmic particles are unmanifest in a field that is as small as the size of a body, and manifest in a field that is as large as the size of a body."

---------------------------
From the knowledge, how much area is filled and how much area is pervaded by the karmic particles that are separated from the soul's regions? / [2156-1 U] Gautama! In terms of extension and thickness, the area of the body and the area of the smallest finger in length (mayaam) is filled and pervaded in one direction (from the smallest fraction of an angul to the highest innumerable yojanas). / So much area is filled and so much area is pervaded. / [2] Then, Bhante! For how long is the field unfilled and for how long is it filled? Gautama! It is unfilled for one, two, three, or four moments and it is filled for one, two, three, or four moments. / The rest is the same as before, up to five actions. [2156-2 Pr.] Bhagavan! For how long is that field filled with karmic particles and for how long is it pervaded? [2156-2 U] Gautama! That (the field that is innumerable yojanas long) is filled and pervaded by those karmic particles for one, two, three, or four moments. Then, the rest is the same as before, up to five actions. / 2157. And so on. Now, in terms of length, the smallest is a few thousand yojanas and the largest is innumerable yojanas. In one direction, that field is filled and pervaded by those karmic particles. It should be said that it is filled and pervaded for one, two, or three moments, but not for four moments. Then, the rest is the same as before, up to five actions. / [2157] The same should be understood for the hell-being as for the aggregate being. / The special thing is that the smallest length is a few thousand yojanas and the largest is innumerable yojanas. In one direction, that field is filled and pervaded by those karmic particles. It should be said that it is filled and pervaded for one, two, or three moments, but not for four moments. Then, the rest is the same as before, up to five actions. / 2158. [1] The statement of the Asura-Kumar is like that of the being (Su. 2156) / The special thing is that the Asura-Kumar's moment (as stated in Su. 2157) is like that of the hell-being, three moments. / The rest is the same as before. / _ [2158-1] The statement of the Asura-Kumar should also be understood according to the statement of the being (in Su. 2156) regarding the killing-ending-destruction. / The special thing is that the Asura-Kumar's moment (as stated in Su. 2157) should be understood as three moments, like that of the hell-being. / The rest is the same as before. /

---------------------------
[Thirty-sixth Chapter of the Samudghāta-pada] [277 [2] Just as it has been said in the case of the Asura-kumāras, so also here (in the following statements) up to the Vāimānika Devas (it should be said / ). The special point is that the entire statement concerning the one-sensed being (in relation to the Māranāntika-samudghāta) should be said ( / ) like the Jīva ( / ). The conclusion of the discussion is that the Jīva, being associated with the Māranāntika-samudghāta, separates the Pudgalas from its own Ātma-pradeśas (from its own body) which are within the Taijasa-śarīra etc., and the extent of the body's circumference (width) and thickness (thickness) is as much as the area and length of the Jīva's body, which is an innumerable part of an angula (finger) from its own body in the inferior case and an innumerable yojana in the superior case, is filled and pervaded in one direction. / Here it should be understood that the said area is filled and pervaded in one direction only, not in all directions, because the Jīva's pradeśas naturally move only in one direction. / It is possible for the inferior and superior Ātma-pradeśas to fill the same area. In the superior case, the area of an innumerable yojana in length is filled and touched in four times the time of the Vigraha-gati. / * After this, the statement of all the remaining facts related to the Māranāntika-samudghāta should be made like the statement of the Vedana-samudghāta, from the Nārakas to the Vāimānikas, all the statements up to 'five actions are required'. It should be said up to this point. The special difference here is that the area of a few thousand yojanas in length in the inferior case and an innumerable yojana in the superior case is filled and pervaded in one direction, and not in four times, but in a maximum of three times the time of the Vigraha-gati. / The statement is the same for all the Jīvas from the Asura-kumāras to the Vāimānikas, but it should be said that this area is filled and pervaded in a maximum of three times the time of the Vigraha-gati. The Vigraha of the Nārakas etc. is a maximum of three times. / For example, if a Nārak is present in the Vāyavya-dikṣā and in the Bharatakṣetra, and is going to be born in the east direction as a Pañcendriya-tiryañc or a human being, then in the first time he goes up, in the second time he goes from the Vāyavya-dikṣā to the west direction, and then from the west direction to the east direction. / In this way, the Vigraha is only three times, which should be understood up to the Vāimānikas. ' The Devas from the Asura-kumāras to the Iśāna-deva-loka are also born as Pṛthvīkāyika, Apkāyika or Vanaspatikāyika. When an Asura-kumāra with a complex determination is going to be born as a Pṛthvīkāyika in one part of his own Kuṇḍala etc., and he performs the Māranāntika-samudghāta, then 1. (a) Prajñāpana.

[278] The Prajñāpanā Sūtra states that the area covered by the countless parts of a finger, which is smaller than the length, is only a small area. The entire statement of the one-sensed being should be understood as being the same as the aggregate being. The area, time, and action of the being, etc., which are associated with the Vaikriya Samudghāta, should be understood as follows: / _2156. [1]  O Bhagavan!  What is the area that is filled and what is the area that is touched by the beings who are deluded by the Vaikriya Samudghāta, who are deluded by the Vaikriya Samudghāta, and who are deluded by the Vaikriya Samudghāta? /  Gautama!  The area that is filled and the area that is touched is as much as the extent and bulk of the body, as much as the countless parts of a finger in length, and as much as the countless yojanas in height, in one direction or in all directions. [2156-1 Pr.]  O Bhagavan!  What is the area that is filled and what is the area that is touched by the beings who are deluded by the Vaikriya Samudghāta, who are deluded by the Vaikriya Samudghāta, and who are deluded by the Vaikriya Samudghāta? /  Gautama!  The area that is filled and the area that is touched is as much as the extent and bulk of the body, as much as the countless parts of a finger in length, and as much as the countless yojanas in height, in one direction or in all directions. [2]  O Bhagavan!  How much time does it take to fill and touch that area? /  Gautama!  It takes one, two, or three moments to fill and touch that area. /  The rest of the statement is the same as before, up to the point where it says "five actions are required." 2160.  This is how it should be said.  The area that is filled and touched is as much as the countless parts of a finger in length and as much as the countless yojanas in height, in one direction. /  How much time does it take to fill and touch that area?  The answer is the same as the statement about the aggregate being (Su. 2156). /  [2160]  The same should be said about the Narakas (the statement about the Vaikriya Samudghāta).  The special thing is that the area that is filled and touched is as much as the countless parts of a finger in length and as much as the countless yojanas in height, in one direction.  How much time does it take to fill and touch that area?  The answer is the same as the statement about the aggregate being (Su. 2156). /  2161.  Just as the statement about the Narakas (Su. 2160) is made, so also the statement about the Asura Kumaras should be made. /  The area that is filled and touched is as much as the countless parts of a finger in length and as much as the countless yojanas in height, in one direction or in all directions. /  This should be continued up to the statement about the Thaṇiya Kumaras.

[Thirty-sixth Samudghatapad] [279 should be understood.

Baukkaiyass Jaha Jivapad (Su. 2156) / Navaran Egadiisi / [2162] The statement of Vayukayik (related to Vakripasamudghat) should be understood as the same as Jivapad (according to Su. 2159).

Panchendriyatirikhkhjooniyass Giravaseesan Jaha Raiyass (Su. 2160) / [2163] Just as (in Su. 2160) the statement of Nairyaik (related to Vaikriyasamudghat) has been made, so should the entire statement of Panchendriyatiryanch be made. 2164.

[2164] The complete statement of Manushya, Vanavyantar, Jotishk and Vaimanik (related to Vaikriyasamudghat) (as stated in Su. 2161) should be said like Asurakumar. Discussion-Vaikriyasamudghat is the touching of the field, the change of time and the formation of the action-(1) From Vaikriyasamudghat, the Samvahat Jiva removes the pudgals from inside the Vaikriyagya body (separates them from himself), then from those pudgals, as much as the body's expansion and thickness is, so much and in length, the countless part of the inferior angul and the superior number of yojan fields are complete and filled (touched) in one direction or Vidisha / / Here, the filling of the superior number of yojan-proof fields in length should be understood in comparison to Narak etc., except for Vayukayik, because when Narak etc. do Vaikriyasamudghat, then with special effort, they create the punishment of the number of yojan-proof areas, they do not create the punishment of countless yojan-proof areas / But Vayukayik Jivas create the punishment of only the countless part of the inferior and superior angul at the time of Vaikriyasamudghat / While creating the punishment of such proof, Narak etc. remove the pudgals of Tejasasheer etc. from the Atma-areas in that area, in such a situation, the area filled and filled with those pudgals is the superior number of yojan in length. This proof of the field is said only in relation to the effort arising from Vaikriyasamudghat. 'When a Jiva who has obtained Vaikriyasamudghat obtains Maranantakasamudghat and then comes to the place of origin from the superior country with the force of intense effort in three times, then the area of countless yojan should be understood / This countless yojan-proof area is not intended here because it is born from Maranantakasamudghat. For this reason, the Vaikriyasamudghat-born field 1. Prajnapan. Malayavritti, Abhi. Ra. Kosh, Bha. 7 p. 456

Page #1475:
---------------------------
[280] The *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* is said to be a *yojanā* in number. Similarly, with respect to the *nārakas*, the five-sense *tiryañca*, and the *vāyukaika*, the fulfillment of the aforementioned long field with proof should be understood only in one direction. *Nārakas* are dependent and have little merit. The five-sense *tiryañca* also have little merit, and the *vāyukaika* beings are deficient in specific consciousness. In such a situation, when they begin the *vaikriya samudghāta*, naturally the punishment of the *ātma-pradeśas* comes out, and naturally the *pudgalas* move away from the *ātma-pradeśas* according to the series, not in the series. For this reason, the aforementioned extent of the *nārakas*, the five-sense *tiryañca*, and the *vāyukaika* should be understood only in one direction, not in multiple directions. However, the *bhavanapati*, *vāṇavyantara*, *jyotiṣka*, and *vaimānika* gods and humans are free to roam at will, they are independent and also possess specific attainments, therefore, they also bring out the punishment of the *ātma-pradeśas* in multiple directions through specific effort. It is said in this regard, " *ṇavarā egadiśi vidiśi vā* ", meaning, "The gods and humans of the four categories, starting with the *asurakumāra* and ending with the *bhavanapati*, also fulfill and occupy the aforementioned field in one direction." (2) The aforementioned field with proof, from the point of origin of the *vigraha-gati* to the destination, is fulfilled and occupied by the *vigraha-gati* in one, two, or three times. Thus, with respect to the *vigraha-gati*, the fulfillment of the aforementioned field with proof from the time of death to the destination is completed in a maximum of three times, it does not take a fourth time. The *vāyukaika* arising from the *vaikriya samudghāta* is also usually born in the *trasanāḍī*, and the *vigraha-gati* of the *trasanāḍī* is a maximum of three times. Therefore, it is said here that the aforementioned field with proof is fulfilled and touched in so many (one, two, or three) times. (3-4-5-6) After this, the four facts related to the action should be understood in the same way as the statement related to the *vedanā samudghāta*. The description of the field, time, and action of the *tejas samudghāta* - *samavahata* beings, etc. is as follows: 2165. " *Jīve ṇam bhante! Teyagasamugghāeṇam samohāe samohaniṭṭā je poggale niśśubhai tehi ṇam bhante! Poggalehi kevatiye khete afuṇṇe*? " " *Evam jaheva veubbiyasamugdhāe* (Su. 2156-64) *taheva* / *ṇavarā āyāmeṇam jahaṇṇeṇam angulassā asankhejjatibhāga, sesam tam ceva* / *evam jāva vemāniyassā, ṇavarā pañcendriyatirikkhajōniyassā egadiśi evatiye khete afuṇṇe* / [2165 Pr.] "O Lord! From the *tejas samudghāta*, the *samavahata* beings become *samavahata* and the *pudgalas* that they expel (from their body), O Lord! How much field is fulfilled and how much field is touched (occupied) by those *pudgalas*?" [2165 U. Gautama! Just as (in Su. 2156-64) it is said about the *vaikriya samudghāta*, so it should be said about the *tejas samudghāta*. The special thing is that the *tejas samudghāta* is emitted 1.

**[281] From the 281 pudgalas, the area that is filled and touched is an innumerable part of an angula in length, and the rest of the statement is the same as the statement of the Vaikriya-samudghāta. Thus, the statement should be understood up to the Vaimānika. The special thing is that the Panchendriya-tiryanch (five-sensed animals) fill and occupy the aforementioned area in one direction only. Discussion - The Tejas-samudghāta occurs only in the four types of Devanikāya, Panchendriya-tiryanch, and humans. It does not occur in the Naraka and the Ekendriya, Vikalendriya. The Devanikāya, etc., are all very diligent. Therefore, when they begin the Tejas-samudghāta, the area that is filled and occupied is an innumerable part of an angula in length, not a countable part. The aforementioned area is filled in all directions except for the Panchendriya-tiryanch. The Panchendriya-tiryanch only fill and touch the aforementioned area in one direction. The rest of the statements should be understood as the same as the statements of the Vaikriya-samudghāta.**

**[2166] Āhāraka-samudghāta - The area, time, and action of the Samvahata Jīva, etc. [1]  "O Bhagavan! When the Samvahata Jīva performs the Āhāraka-samudghāta, and removes the (Āhāraka-yogya) pudgalas from his body, O Bhagavan! from those pudgalas, how much area is filled and how much area is touched (occupied)? [2166-1 U.] Gautama! The area filled and touched is only the size of the body in terms of its width and thickness, and in length, it is an innumerable part of an angula in the lower limit and a countable number of yojanas in the upper limit, in one direction only. [2] "O Bhagavan! How long does it take for the Jīva to remove those pudgalas? [2166-2 Pr.]  [2166-2 U.] Gautama! It takes from the lower limit to the upper limit of an Antomuhurta."**

Therefore, when the Muni, who is a reader of the fourteen Purvas and a holder of the Aharakalabdhi, performs the Aharakasamudghāt, he makes the aforementioned region distinct from the Prātmāpradeśas with the Pudgalas that are incomplete and clear in one direction, not in Vidisha. / In Vidisha, what is complete and clear requires another effort, but the Muni who holds the Aharakalabdhi and performs the Aharakasamudghāt is so serious that he has no such purpose. / Therefore, they do not make another effort. / In the same way, any being who is the subject of the Aharakasamudghāt attains death and is born from the Vigrahagati, and that Vigraha is at most three times. All other statements related to the Aharakasamudghāt should be known to be the same as the Vedanasamudghāt. Why is the Aharakasamudghāt mentioned in the Dandakakrama? Although the Aharakasamudghāt happens only to humans, therefore, the Aharakasamudghāt that is described in the Samuccaya Jivapada includes humans, but the Aharakasamudghāt of humans obtained specifically from the Dandakakrama is also mentioned. / Therefore, one should not imagine a redundancy here. The last Pudgalas of the Anāgāra, which are un-destroyed by the Kevalasamudghāt-Samavahata, are Lokavyāpita 2168. Anāgāras, O Venerable! What are the last Nirjarā-Pudgalas of the Samamoha, which is associated with the Kevalasamudghāt, are they subtle Pudgalas, O Venerable Śramaṇa? Do they touch all the Lokas? [2168 U.] Yes, Gautama! The last Nirjarā-Pudgalas of the Anāgāra, which are associated with the Kevalasamudghāt, O Venerable Śramaṇa, are subtle Pudgalas and they touch all the Lokas. 2169. O Venerable! Does the mind know or see any color, form, smell, taste, or touch of those Nirjarā-Pudgalas? 1. (a) Prajñāpanā. Malayavṛtti, Abhi, Rā. Ko. Bhā. 7, p. 456 (b) Prajñāpanā.

[284] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra] Gotama! I do not understand this. Why, Bhante? Thus it is said: In the case of a Chhadmastha, do they perceive any color with the eye, any smell with the nose, any taste with the tongue, or any touch with the skin? Gotama! The Jambudvipa is a continent, situated in the midst of all the continents and oceans, the smallest of all, circular in shape, like a sesame seed, like a chariot wheel, like a lotus seed, and like a full moon. It is one hundred thousand yojanas in length and breadth. Three hundred thousand, sixteen thousand, two hundred twenty-seven yojanas, three kosas, one hundred eighteen dhanus, thirteen and a half angulas, with a little more circumference, it is said. A god, endowed with moderate or great happiness, takes a large box of fragrant ointment, and opens it. Then, that large box of fragrant ointment, which is open,

---------------------------
"If someone were to take a box filled with fragrant substances and, in the time it takes to clap three times, were to circle the entire Jambudvipa twenty-one times, would the entire Jambudvipa be touched by those fragrant particles?" [Question] "Yes, Venerable One, it would be touched." [Answer] "Gautama, can a deluded human being perceive the class of olfactory particles with their eyes, the smell with their nose, the taste with their tongue, and the touch with their sense of touch?" [Question] "Lord, this is not possible." [Answer] "For this reason, Gautama, it is said that a deluded human being cannot perceive the class of Nirjara particles with their eyes, the smell with their nose, the taste with their tongue, and the touch with their sense of touch. Ayushman Shraman, these (Nirjara) particles are said to be subtle and they remain in contact with the entire universe. In the chapter on Kevalisamudghata, which deals with the subtle particles of the Kevalisamudghata, the mind of the liberated soul, the following two points are clarified: (1) It is true that the subtle particles of the fourth stage of the Kevalisamudghata, which are present in the mind of the liberated soul, are extremely subtle and they permeate the entire universe. (2) Deluded humans cannot perceive the color, smell, taste, and touch of these Nirjara particles because, firstly, these particles are extremely subtle, and secondly, they are present throughout the universe. There is no place where they are not present, and the universe is vast. A part of the universe is Jambudvipa, which is located in the middle of all the islands and oceans, and is the smallest, because the extent of all the islands and oceans from Jambudvipa onwards is double. That is, the salt sea, the Dhataki-khanda, and other islands beyond Jambudvipa are twice as long and wide as the islands and seas before them, and their circumference is also much larger. Jambudvipa, which is round like a cake cooked in oil, or like the wheel of a chariot, or like a lotus seed, or like a full moon, is also one hundred thousand yojanas in length and breadth. Its circumference is three hundred thousand, sixteen thousand, two hundred and twenty-seven yojanas, three kosas, one hundred and twenty-eight dhanushas, and 133 angulas, plus a little more. If a great and powerful, happy, and strong god were to take a box filled with fragrant substances and, in the time it takes to clap three times, were to circle the entire Jambudvipa twenty-one times, the entire Jambudvipa would be filled with those fragrant substances (particles) in that time. Just as a deluded human being cannot perceive the fragrant particles that are present in the entire universe, let alone in a region of the universe like Jambudvipa, similarly, a deluded human being cannot perceive the final particles that are expelled by the Kevali Bhagavan during the Kevalisamudghata, because they are extremely subtle and spread everywhere." 

**Explanation of Difficult Words:**

* **Charma Nirjara-poggala:** The final particles expelled during the fourth stage of the Kevalisamudghata.
* **Vanne-nam:** With the eye, the sense organ that perceives color.
* **Ghane-nam:** With the nose, the sense organ that perceives smell.

[286] "By the tongue, the organ of taste, it is grasped by the taste-sense. By the skin, the organ of touch, it is grasped by the touch-sense. It is spread throughout all, the smallest, like a fried dough cake made of oil, like a wheel of a chariot, with a circumference, complete, by the tips of the fingers, by circling around, it is touched, it is pervaded." The intention of beginning this chapter in this way is that the entire universe is pervaded by the ultimate nirjara-pudgalas that are expelled from the body of a muni who is endowed with kevali-samudghata, which only a kevali can know and see, not a chhadmastha human being. A chhadmastha human being cannot know or see them in any way, whether ordinary or special. The purpose of kevali-samudghata is [2170. [1] "What is the purpose, venerable sir, of a kevali performing samudghata?" [2170. [1] "Gautama! The four karma-ansh of a kevali are not exhausted, not experienced (not enjoyed), not attained to nirjara. They (four karmas) are as follows: (1) vedaniya, (2) ayu, (3) nama and (4) gotra. Their vedaniya karma is the most extensive. Their ayu karma is the least (extensive). Gatha-artha-] They make the uneven (karma) even by the bonds and conditions. (Actually) to make the uneven karmas even by the bonds and conditions. It is for this reason that a kevali performs kevali-samudghata and in this way attains kevali-samudghata. [2] "Venerable sir, do all kevalis perform samudghata?" "Venerable sir, do all kevalis attain samudghata?" "Gautama! One who is not firm and steady, whose ayu is equal to the bonds and conditions, does not attain samudghata in the bhava-vaggaha karma." // 226 // 1.

The thirty-sixth chapter of the text discusses the concept of *kevalisamudghāt* (the act of a Kevali, a liberated soul, performing a specific ritual).

**Question:** Do all Kevali Bhagavans perform *kevalisamudghāt*? And do all Kevalis attain *kevalisamudghāt*?

**Answer:** Gautama, this is not a valid question. A Kevali who has *bhavopaṇāhi* karmas (karmas that bind them to the cycle of birth and death) equal in strength and duration to their *āyuṣyakarma* (life-span karma) does not perform *kevalisamudghāt*. There are countless Kevali Jinas who have attained liberation without performing *kevalisamudghāt*, free from old age and death, and have attained the highest state of *siddhi* (perfection).

**Explanation:** The question arises because Kevalis are already perfect and possess infinite knowledge. Why would they need to perform *kevalisamudghāt*? The text clarifies that even Kevalis are not completely free from karmas. They still have four *aghāti* karmas (karmas that cannot be destroyed by any other means), which are *bhavopaṇāhi* karmas.

These four karmas are not fully exhausted because they have not been fully experienced. As the saying goes, "Unconsumed karma does not decay." Karma decays only when it is experienced through its *pradeśa* (regions) or *vipāka* (results). It is also said, "All karma is experienced through its *pradeśa*."

The four karmas that remain to be experienced by Kevalis are *vedanīya* (painful), *prāyu* (life-span), *nāma* (name), and *gotra* (lineage). Since these four karmas have not been fully experienced, they have not been exhausted. This means they have not been separated from the *ātma-pradeśa* (regions of the soul).

Among these four, *vedanīya* karma has the most *pradeśa*. *Nāma* and *gotra* also have many *pradeśa*, but not as many as *āyuṣyakarma*. *Āyuṣyakarma* has the fewest *pradeśa*.

If the remaining three karmas of a Kevali are not equal in strength to their *āyuṣyakarma*, they perform *kevalisamudghāt* to equalize them. They equalize the uneven karmas, which are not equal in strength and duration, so that all four karmas can be destroyed simultaneously.

*Bandhana* (binding) refers to the karmas that are bound to the *ātma-pradeśa* through *yoga* (actions of mind, speech, and body). *Sthiti* (duration) refers to the time during which the karmas are experienced.

Through *bandhana* and *sthiti*, Kevalis equalize their *vedanīya* and other karmas to their *āyuṣyakarma*. Karma is called *dravya-bandhana* (binding of substance), while the time of experience is called *sthiti*. This is the purpose of *kevalisamudghāt*.

Kevalis whose *prāyuṣyakarma* is equal in strength and duration to their other *bhavopaṇāhi* karmas do not perform *kevalisamudghāt*. They attain liberation from all karmas without performing *kevalisamudghāt*, becoming *siddha* (perfect), *buddha* (enlightened), and free from old age and death. There are countless such *siddhas*.

*Kevalisamudghāt* is performed by Kevalis who have a shorter lifespan and whose *vedanīya* and other three karmas have a longer duration and more *pradeśa*. This is done to equalize all of them.

Page #1483:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**[288]** By initiating the *Prajnapana Sutra*, the four karmas become equal in their extent and duration. If they do not initiate it, the *Ayukarma* would end first, leaving the other three karmas. In such a situation, they would either attain liberation with the three remaining karmas or bind new *Ayukarma*, but both are impossible. In the state of liberation, karmas cannot remain, and liberated beings cannot bind new *Ayukarma*. Therefore, through *Kevalisamudghat*, they specifically exhaust the extent of the three karmas (*Vedaniya*, etc.) and destroy their long duration, making them equal to *Ayukarma*, so that all four can be destroyed simultaneously.

**Gautama Swami**, for further clarity, asks: "O Bhagavan! Do all Kevalis engage in *Samudghat*?"

**Answer:** Not all Kevalis engage in *Samudghat*, nor do all perform it. The reason has been explained above. When all karmas are destroyed, the soul's state of being in its pure nature is called *Siddhi*. One whose four karmas are naturally equal, attains *Siddhi* by destroying them simultaneously without performing *Samudghat*.

**[2171]** "O Bhagavan! How long is *Avarjikan* said to be?"

**Answer:** "Gautama! *Avarjikan* is said to be for an immeasurable period of time, the duration of an *Antarmuhurta*."

**[2172]** "O Bhagavan! How long is *Kevalisamudghat* said to be?"

**Answer:** "Gautama! It is said to be for eight moments. It is as follows: In the first moment, it creates the *Danda* (staff), in the second moment, it creates the *Kapat* (door), in the third moment, it churns, in the fourth moment, it pervades the *Lok* (universe), in the fifth moment, it contracts the *Lok-purana* (filling of the universe), in the sixth moment, it contracts the churning, in the seventh moment, it contracts the *Kapat*, and in the eighth moment, it contracts the *Danda*. As soon as the *Danda* contracts, it becomes embodied again."

**[2173]** "O Bhagavan! In the *Samudghat* process, does it involve *Manajoga* (mental yoga), *Vajoga* (verbal yoga), or *Kayajoga* (physical yoga)?"

[289] Gotama! Does the Kevali use mano-yoga, vacana-yoga, or kaya-yoga? [2173-1 Pr.] Bhagavan! Does the Kevali who has attained such a state of liberation use mano-yoga, vacana-yoga, or kaya-yoga? [2173-1 Ut.] Gotama! He does not use mano-yoga, nor does he use vacana-yoga, but he uses kaya-yoga. [2]  Bhagavan! Which kaya-yoga does the Kevali use? Does he use audarik-sarira-kaya-yoga, audarik-misra-sarira-kaya-yoga, vaikriya-sarira-kaya-yoga, vaikriya-misra-sarira-kaya-yoga, aharak-sarira-kaya-yoga, aharak-misra-sarira-kaya-yoga, or karma-sarira-kaya-yoga? [2173-2 Pr.] Gotama! He uses audarik-sarira-kaya-yoga, and he also uses audarik-misra-sarira-kaya-yoga, but he does not use vaikriya-sarira-kaya-yoga, nor does he use vaikriya-misra-sarira-kaya-yoga, nor does he use aharak-sarira-kaya-yoga, nor does he use aharak-misra-sarira-kaya-yoga. He uses karma-sarira-kaya-yoga. In the first and eighth time periods, he uses audarik-sarira-kaya-yoga. In the second, sixth, and seventh time periods, he uses audarik-misra-sarira-kaya-yoga. In the third, fourth, and fifth time periods, he uses karma-sarira-kaya-yoga. [2173-2 Ut.] Gotama! (The Kevali uses kaya-yoga) He also uses audarik-sarira-kaya-yoga, and he also uses audarik-misra-sarira-kaya-yoga, but he does not use vaikriya-sarira-kaya-yoga, nor does he use vaikriya-misra-sarira-kaya-yoga, nor does he use aharak-sarira-kaya-yoga, nor does he use aharak-misra-sarira-kaya-yoga. He uses karma-sarira-kaya-yoga. In the first and eighth time periods, he uses audarik-sarira-kaya-yoga. In the second, sixth, and seventh time periods, he uses audarik-misra-sarira-kaya-yoga. In the third, fourth, and fifth time periods, he uses karma-sarira-kaya-yoga. 2174. [1] Bhagavan! Does the Kevali who has attained such a state of liberation become a Siddha, a Buddha, a Mukta, and attain Nirvana? Does he end all suffering? [2174-1 Pr.] Gotama! He is not in that state, he is in a state of liberation. After liberation, he uses mano-yoga, vacana-yoga, and kaya-yoga. [2174-1 Ut.] Gotama! He is not in that state, he is in a state of liberation. After liberation, he uses mano-yoga, vacana-yoga, and kaya-yoga.

Page #1485:
---------------------------
Gautama! This matter (fact) is not possible. First, they (the Kevali) desist from that (Kevalisamudghata). Thereafter, they utilize mano-yoga (mental activity), they also utilize vacana-yoga (speech activity) and kaya-yoga (bodily activity).

[2] When practicing mano-yoga, does he practice true mano-yoga, false mano-yoga, both true and false mano-yoga, or neither true nor false mano-yoga? Gautama! He practices true mano-yoga, not false mano-yoga, nor both true and false mano-yoga, but he also practices neither true nor false mano-yoga.

[3] When practicing vacana-yoga, does he practice true vacana-yoga, false vacana-yoga, both true and false vacana-yoga, or neither true nor false vacana-yoga? Gautama! He practices true vacana-yoga, not false vacana-yoga, nor both true and false vacana-yoga, but he also practices neither true nor false vacana-yoga.

[4] When practicing kaya-yoga, he may come, go, stand, sit, turn over, transgress, or specially transgress (jump), or return the special seat (chair), mat, bed, and bedding.

Gautama! Does the Kevali with yoga attain the end (liberation)? Gautama! Not in this way. He first abandons the mano-yoga of the five-sensed being with the least yoga, then subsequently the mano-yoga of the two-sensed being, and so on.

The thirty-sixth destruction of the jhana-yogin, who is not endowed with the jhana, is the destruction of the countless inferior manas-yoga, which is lower than the manas-yoga of the one who is endowed with the jhana. After that, the destruction of the countless inferior vaci-yoga, which is lower than the vaci-yoga of the subtle, panakajiva, who is not endowed with the jhana, is the destruction of the countless inferior vaci-yoga. Then, the destruction of the countless inferior kaya-yoga, which is lower than the kaya-yoga of the subtle, panakajiva, who is not endowed with the jhana, is the destruction of the countless inferior kaya-yoga. / By this means, he first destroys the manas-yoga, then destroys the vaci-yoga after destroying the manas-yoga, then destroys the kaya-yoga after destroying the vaci-yoga, and then destroys the kaya-yoga. By destroying the kaya-yoga, he destroys all yogas. By destroying all yogas, he attains the state of being without yoga. After attaining the state of being without yoga, he accepts the shaileshikarana, which lasts for as long as the utterance of five short syllables (a, i, u, ri, l), for countless samaya-antarmuhurtas. In that shaileshikarana, he destroys countless karma-skandhas, which are the result of the accumulation of past good deeds. By destroying these karma-skandhas, he destroys the four types of karma: vedaniya, ayu, nama, and gotra. By destroying these four types of karma simultaneously, he completely abandons the audarika, tejas, and karman bodies forever. By completely abandoning these three bodies, he attains the straight path, and with an unstained speed, he ascends upwards in one moment, without any interruption, and becomes suitable for the knowledge-use. He becomes a Siddha, a Buddha, a liberated one, and a parinirvrita, and he ends all suffering. / Discussion - The Kevali-samudghata, before and after the Kevali, is the process of becoming a Kevali. In this case, first comes the process of becoming a Kevali, then the Kevali-samudghata at the time of the reading, and then the Kevali who is in the process of becoming a Kevali. 1. More reading - 'tatya siddho bhavati' - that is, he becomes a Siddha (liberated) there (when he reaches the Siddha-sila).

[292] The text of the *Prajñāpanā Sūtra* mentions the practice of *kāyayoga* within the three yogas, and also describes its order. Here, four meanings are intended for *āvarjīkaraṇa*: (1) turning the soul towards liberation, (2) achieving liberation through the auspicious use of mind, speech, and body, (3) *āvarjīkaraṇa* is the engagement of auspicious yogas towards liberation due to *prāvajita* (i.e., *bhavyatva*), and (4) the use of auspicious yogas from the perspective of a *kevali* within the *prā* boundaries. *Āvarjīkaraṇa* is performed before the *kevalisamudghāta*, which takes an immeasurable amount of time. After *āvarjīkaraṇa*, *kevalisamudghāta* begins without interruption, and it lasts for a *pāṭha* time. The text provides the order of this process. In the initial four *kalas*, the *ātmapradeśas* are expanded, while in the last four *kalas*, they are contracted. It is also said that in the first *kala*, the *kevali* extends their body-measure to the upper and lower *lokaantas* and in all directions, in the second *kala* they perform *kapāta*, in the third *kala* they perform *manthāna*, and in the fourth *kala* they fill the *lokas*. Then, they contract in the reverse order, i.e., in the opposite direction, and return to their own body. (2) The order of the attainment of *yoganirodha* etc. by the *kevali* who performs *samudghāta* - (1) Before attaining *siddhi*, the *kevali* is not *siddha* (established in the meaning), *buddha*, *mukta*, or attained *parinirvāṇa* (cooled due to being free from karmic afflictions) even though they have attained *samudghāta* in the *samudghāta* state, and they are not free from all suffering. This is because their yogas are not yet restrained, and the *sayogi* has not yet attained *siddhi*. What do they do before attaining *siddhi*? In this regard, it is said that the *kevali* in the *samudghāta* state withdraws from *kevalisamudghāta* and then practices *manoyoga*, *vacaṇayoga*, and *kāyayoga*. (2) (3) The practice of *kāyayoga* by the *kevali* in the *samudghāta* state - The *kevali* in the *samudghāta* state practices *audārikasārīrakāyayoga*, *audārikamiśrasārīrakāyayoga*, and *kārmaṇasārīrakāyayoga* in the first and eighth, second, sixth, and seventh, and third, fourth, and fifth *kalas*, respectively. They do not practice the remaining *vaikriyavaikriyamiśra* and *āhārak-pāhārak miśra* *kāyayogas*. (4) The practice of the three yogas after withdrawing from *kevalisamudghāta* - After withdrawing from *samudghāta*, they practice *manoyoga*, and within that, only *satyamanoyoga* and *asatyāmṛṣāmanoyoga*. They do not practice *mṛṣāmanoyoga* and *satyāmṛṣāmanoyoga*. The meaning is that when the *kevali* Bhagavan, endowed with the glory of *vacanāgocara*, withdraws from *kevalisamudghāta* by making the *nāma*, *gotra*, and *vedanīya* karmas, which are in an uneven state, equal to the *āyukarma*, they attain the supreme state in the same *antarmuhūrta*. However, during that period, they practice *manoyoga* by taking in the *pudgalas* of *manovargāṇa* to answer the questions asked by the *anuttarauṣapātika* devas with their minds. That *manoyoga* is either *satyamanoyoga* or *asatyāmṛṣāmanoyoga*. The *kevali* who has withdrawn from *samudghāta* speaks the truth. 1. *Prajñāpanā*. (Commentary *Prameyabodhinī*) Bha. 5 2.

[Thirty-second Samudyatapad] [293 Yogas use Asatyamrshavchanayog, but not Mrshavchanayog or Satyamrshavchanayog / Similarly, Samudghatanivritta Kevali performs actions like walking and coming and going with effort. Here, the meaning of the actions of violation and transgression is as follows: Violation is to take a step longer than the natural step, and transgression is an extremely difficult step. If there are flying creatures in a place and the land is filled with them, then the Kevali has to perform the actions of violation and transgression to protect them. (5) Without complete Yoganirodh, even the Kevali cannot attain Siddhi - the Kevali who has attained Samudghata in the order of Dand, Kapata, etc., even after becoming free from Samudghata, as long as he is in the Sayogi state, he cannot become Siddha, Buddha, Mukta / According to the Shastrakar, in the Antarmuhurta time, they attain the Ayog state and become Siddha, Buddha, Mukta, but until the Antarmuhurta time, the Kevali is freed by the use of all three Yogas as appropriate / There are two reasons why the Kevali cannot become Siddha-Mukta in the Sayogi state (1) Yogatraya is the cause of Karmabandha and (2) Sayogi cannot start Shukladhyan, which is the cause of Paramanirjara / / (6) The order of Yoganirodh by the Kevali - In the order of Yoganirodh, the Kevali Bhagwan first performs Manoyoganirodh / In the first time of the Panchaindriya being with Paryaptak Sanjni, there are as many Manodravya as there are and as much Manoyog-Vyapar as there is, even less than that, he performs Manoyoganirodh every moment, and in countless times, he completely stops Manoyog / Immediately after stopping Manoyog, he performs Vachanayoganirodh every moment, which is less than the Vachanayog of the Dwiiindriya with Paryaptak and Jghanyayog, and in countless times, he completely stops the second Vachanayog. When Vachanayog is also stopped, then the Aparyaptak Sukshma Pankajiv, who is born in the first time and has Jghanyayog and is less powerful than everyone else, he performs Kayayoganirodh every moment, which is less than his Kayayog, and in countless times, he completely stops the third Kayayog. In this way, by stopping Kayayog as well, Kevali Bhagwan becomes established in Samuchchhinna, Sukshmakriya, Avinashwar and Apratipati Dhyan / By this Parmashukladhyan, they fill the holes of the mouth, stomach, etc., and contract the third part of their body - the Nyun Pratmapradeshas / By this process of stopping Kayayog, they also abandon the third part of their own body. ' After completely stopping Yoganirodh - they attain the Ayogidasha. As soon as they attain it, they perform Shaileshikaran / Neither too fast nor too slow, i.e., in a moderate way, five short (a, i, u, 1. Prajnapan. (Prameyabodhini Tika) Bha. 5, p. 1133-1135 2.

[294] [Prajñāpanā Sūtra Ṛ, L] They remain in the state of Śaileśīkaraṇa for as long as it takes to pronounce the letters. Śīla means all-encompassing character, its lord is Śīleśa, and the state of Śīleśa is 'Śaileśī'. At that time, the Kevali remains absorbed in the white meditation called Sūkṣmakriyāpratipāti and Samucchinnakriyāpratipāti. At that time, the Kevali does not only attain Śaileśīkaraṇa, but also, according to the previously created Guṇaśreṇī, destroys countless Karma-skandhas, including Vedaniya, etc., through countless Guṇaśreṇīs, in the form of a Pradesh. Finally, when the four non-violent Karmas, including Vedaniya, etc., are completely destroyed at the same time, they abandon the three bodies, Audārika, Taijasa, and Kārmaṇa, completely. Then, they attain the Ṛjuśreṇī, go to the Lokānta without any bend (turn) at the same time, become suitable through knowledge and use, and become Siddhas. All the gains are obtained only by those who are suitable for the use of the concrete, not at the time of the use of the non-concrete. The description of the nature of the Siddhas 2176. They are Siddhas there, they are without bodies, they are full of Sathanātmā-pradeshas, they are suitable in Darshan and knowledge, they are accomplished (determined), they are free from Karma-raja, they are without tremors, they are free from the darkness of ignorance, and they are completely pure, and they remain for the eternal future.

They are ashariri, i.e., devoid of audarik (gross) and pradi (subtle) bodies, because at the very first moment of Siddhatva (state of being a Siddha), they abandon their audarik and pradi bodies. They are jivadhan (possessing a concentrated soul), i.e., their atma-pradesh (soul-region) becomes dense. There is no gap in between, because at the time of sukshmakriya-apratipati dhyana (meditation that is not affected by subtle actions), they fill the holes (vivaras) like mouth, stomach, etc., due to the effect of that meditation. / They are suitable for darshanopयोग (use of perception) and jnanopयोग (use of knowledge), because use is the nature of the jiva (soul). Siddhas are kritarth (having fulfilled their purpose), nirja (devoid of karma-raja (impurities of karma)) and nishkamp (without any tremors), because there is no cause for tremors there. They are vitimir, i.e., devoid of karma-rupa (form of karma) or ajnana-rupa (form of ignorance). They are vishuddha (pure), i.e., devoid of the combination of vijatiya dravyas (heterogeneous substances), and they are always situated on the Siddhashila (the seat of Siddhas). / Analysis of the reasons for these attributes of Siddhas- Siddhas are called ashariri, nirja, kritarth, nishkamp, vitimir and vishuddha, etc., because just as a seed burnt in fire does not sprout, because fire destroys its ability to sprout, / similarly, when the karma-rupa (karma-form) seeds of Siddhas are burnt by the fire of kevalgyana (omniscience), they do not arise again, because birth is caused by karma, and the karma of Siddhas is completely destroyed. In the absence of the cause, the effect does not arise, due to the absence of karma-bija (karma-seed), there is complete absence of all vikaras (modifications) like raga (attachment), dvesha (aversion), etc. Therefore, bondage of karma is not possible again. Raga, etc., are the causes of karma like ayu (life span), etc., they have already been destroyed. The weakened raga, etc., cannot arise again, because there is no nimitta-karana (efficient cause). The upadana-karana (material cause) for the arising of raga, etc., is the atma itself. Even if it is present, the work cannot arise due to the absence of sahakari-karana (co-operative cause) like vedaniyakarma (karmas that produce feelings), etc., because the work produced by both causes cannot be produced by one cause. In Siddhas, the effect of raga, etc., vedaniyakarmas is not present, because they have already been burnt by the fire of shukladhyana (white meditation), and due to them, sanklesha (afflictions) is also not possible in Siddhas. Due to the absence of raga, etc., vedaniyakarmas, there is no possibility of the arising of raga, etc., again. Due to the absence of rebirth in karma-bandha (bondage of karma), Siddhas always remain in the Siddha-dasha (state of being a Siddha), because due to the absence of raga, etc., karma like ayu, etc., does not arise again, therefore, Siddhas do not take rebirth. 1.

##  Anadhyayakala [Quoted from Nandī Sūtra edited by Acharya Shri Atmaramji Maharaj]

One should study the scriptures only during the time prescribed in the Agamas for self-study. Studying during the Anadhyayakala is prohibited. The Manusmriti and other Smritis also describe the Anadhyayakala in detail. Vedic people also mention the Anadhyayakala of the Vedas. Similarly, other Parsva texts are also considered Anadhyayakala. Since the Jain Agamas are also considered Sarvajñokta, Devadhiṣṭhita, and Svaravidyā, their Anadhyayakala is also mentioned in the Agamas. For example, the ten types of Antalikhite Asajjhāye Paṇṇatte are:

* Ukkāvāte (meteor shower)
* Disidāghe (fire in the sky)
* Gajjite (thunder)
* Vijjute (lightning)
* Nigghāte (wind)
* Juvate (earthquake)
* Jakkhālitte (eclipse)
* Dhūmita (smoke)
* Mahita (fog)
* Rayugghaate (rain)

The ten types of Orālite Prasajjhātite are:

* Aṭṭhi (bones)
* Mansaṁ (flesh)
* Soṇite (blood)
* Asūtisāmante (corpse)
* Susāṇasāmante (cemetery)
* Chandovārāte (lunar eclipse)
* Sūrovārāte (solar eclipse)
* Paḍane (fall)
* Rāyavuggahe (war)
* Uvassayassa Anto Porālie Sarīrage (death)

According to the **Stānanāgasūtra, Stāna 10**, it is not appropriate for a Niggantha or a Nigganthī to study during the four Mahāpāḍivā:

* Āsāḍhapāḍivā
* Indamahāpāḍivā
* Kattiprāpāḍivā
* Sugimhāpāḍivā

It is also not appropriate for a Niggantha or a Nigganthī to study during the four Sambhāhi:

* Paḍhimāte (morning)
* Pacchimāte (evening)
* Majjhaṇhe (noon)
* Aḍḍharatte (midnight)

It is also not appropriate for a Niggantha or a Nigganthī to study during the four Kāla:

* Puḍhaṇhe (forenoon)
* Avaraṇhe (afternoon)
* Parose (east)
* Pacchūse (west)

According to the **Stānanāgasūtra, Stāna 4, Uddesa 2**, the thirty-two Anadhyayakala are considered as follows:

* **Ten Anadhyayakala related to the ten Ākāśa:**
    1. Ukkāpāta-Tārāpatan: If there is a major meteor shower or starfall, one should not study for one Prahara.
    2. Digdāha: One should not study as long as the direction is red, meaning it appears as if there is fire in the direction.
    3. Gajit: One should not study for one Prahara after thunder.
    4. Vijjute: One should not study for one Prahara after lightning.
    5. ... (The remaining six Ākāśa-related Anadhyayakala are not mentioned in the provided text.)

* **Ten Anadhyayakala related to the ten Audārika Śarīra:**
    1. ... (The ten Audārika Śarīra-related Anadhyayakala are not mentioned in the provided text.)

* **Four Mahāpāḍivā:**
    1. Āsāḍhapāḍivā
    2. Indamahāpāḍivā
    3. Kattiprāpāḍivā
    4. Sugimhāpāḍivā

* **Four Mahāpāḍivā Pūrṇimā:**
    1. ... (The four Mahāpāḍivā Pūrṇimā are not mentioned in the provided text.)

* **Four Sandhyā:**
    1. Paḍhimāte (morning)
    2. Pacchimāte (evening)
    3. Majjhaṇhe (noon)
    4. Aḍḍharatte (midnight)

This is a brief description of the thirty-two Anadhyayakala.

## Translation:

**322]** [Thunder and lightning are often due to the nature of the season / Therefore, from the Prardhra to the Swati Nakshatra, it is not considered an Adhyaya. 5. When there is a loud roar in the sky without clouds, or when there is thunder in the sky with clouds, it is an Aswadhyaya period for two Praharas. 6. In the Yupaka-Shukla Paksha, the first, second, and third days, the meeting of the evening glow and the moonlight is called Yupaka / On these days, one should not study from Prahara to night / 7. Yakshadeepta - Sometimes, a light that appears behind a flash of lightning in a particular direction, is called Yakshadeepta. Therefore, one should not study as long as the Yaksha-like light is visible in the sky. 8. Dhumika - From Krishna-Kartik to Magh, the time is the womb month of the clouds. In this, a fine, water-like mist of smoky color falls. It is called Dhumika-Krishna. As long as this mist falls, one should not study. 9. Mihika-Shweta - In winter, a fine, water-like mist of white color is called Mihika / As long as it falls, it is an Aswadhyaya period. 10. Raj-Udghāt - Due to the wind, dust spreads all over the sky / As long as this dust remains spread, one should not study. The above ten reasons are related to the sky, which are Aswadhyaya / The next ten reasons are related to the body, which are Adhyaya 11-12-13. Bones, flesh, and blood - If the bones, flesh, and blood of the five senses are visible, then it is an Aswadhyaya until these things are removed from there. The Vrittikar considers it an Aswadhyaya if these things are present within 60 hands around. Similarly, the bones, flesh, and blood of a human being are also considered an Adhyaya / The special thing is that their Aswadhyaya is for one hundred hands and one day and night. The Aswadhyaya of a woman's menstrual period is for three days / The Aswadhyaya of a boy and a girl's birth is considered to be for seven and eight days respectively. 14. Ashuchi-Mal-Mutra - It is an Aswadhyaya until the excrement and urine are visible. 15. Shmashan - The area around the cremation ground is considered an Aswadhyaya for one hundred hands on all sides. 16. Chandragrahan - During a lunar eclipse, one should not study for the lowest period of one Prahara, the medium period of twelve Praharas, and the highest period of sixteen Praharas. 17. Surya Grahan - During a solar eclipse, it is also considered an Aswadhyaya period for one Prahara, twelve Praharas, and sixteen Praharas respectively.

[Chapter 323] [18. Patan - When a great king or national leader dies, one should not perform *svādhyāya* until his cremation is completed, or one should gradually resume *svādhyāya* until another official takes over. Rājavyaghraha - When there is a war between nearby kings, one should not perform *svādhyāya* until peace is restored, and even after that, one should not perform *svādhyāya* for one day and night. 20. Audārika Śarīra - When a five-sense being dies within a shelter, one should not perform *svādhyāya* as long as the body remains, and if the lifeless body remains within a hundred cubits, one should not perform *svādhyāya*. The above ten reasons for not performing *svādhyāya* are related to the audārika body. 21-28. Four Mahotsava and Four Mahāpratipadā - Āṣāḍha-Pūrṇimā, Āśvina-Pūrṇimā, Kālika-Pūrṇimā, and Chaitra-Pūrṇimā are the four Mahotsava. The pratipadā that comes after these Pūrṇimā is called Mahāpratipadā. Performing *svādhyāya* is prohibited during these days. 29-32. Prātaḥ, Sāyam, Madhyāhna, and Ardharātri - One should not perform *svādhyāya* one ghaḍī before and one ghaḍī after sunrise, one ghaḍī before and one ghaḍī after sunset, one ghaḍī before and one ghaḍī after midday, and one ghaḍī before and one ghaḍī after midnight.

"Abhimat 'Vyakhya-Prajnapti' is the Bhagavati Sutra of the Jains. It is the fifth and a voluminous unique composition among the Agamas written in Ardhamagadhi Prakrit. The seed of Syadvada, the fundamental principle of Jain philosophy, is found for the first time in this. Besides this, it is a wonderful encyclopedia of Jain history, culture, and various sciences, arts, and other subjects. The attractive printing and publishing, along with the easily readable translation, the excellent subject presentation style, and the very useful footnotes, are a delightful confluence. Muni Shri Amarji Maharaj, the author of Vani Bhushan, is a multi-faceted genius. His editorial skills and high-quality scholarship are commendable. Undoubtedly, this successful effort of his will benefit those seeking research in the field of spiritual development and cultural consciousness. The prime source of inspiration and chief editor of this well-written service, Yuvacharya, Bahushruta Muni Shri Madhukarji Maharaj, and the publishing institution deserve our heartfelt gratitude. —Dr. Dharmachand Jain, M.A. (Sanskrit, Pali), Ph.D. Acharya (Sanskrit, Jain Philosophy), Kurukshetra University, Kurukshetra Jain Education International For Private & Personal use only"
