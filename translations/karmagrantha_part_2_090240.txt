Editorial
. The key to understanding Jainism is the 'Karma Siddhanta'. The soul is the foundation of the entire philosophy and knowledge. And the 'Karma Siddhanta' reveals the mystery of the various states, forms of the soul and its transformations. Therefore, to understand Jainism, it is essential to understand the 'Karma Siddhanta'. . Among the major texts that discuss the Karma Siddhanta, 'Shrimad Devendramoori's Karmagranth' holds a special significance. They occupy a very important place in Jain literature. Even those who are curious about the truth consider the Karmagranths as objects of daily study and self-study, like the Agamas.  _ The Sanskrit commentaries on the Karmagranths are very important. There have also been many Gujarati translations of them. The first commentary on the Karmagranths in Hindi was presented by the learned sage, the great scholar, Pt. Sukhlalji. His style is comparative and scholarly. Pt. Sukhlalji's commentary is now almost inaccessible. For some time now, inspiration has been coming from Ashukaviratna Gurudevshri Marudharakesariji M. that the Karmagranths should be presented in a modern style. This editing began with his inspiration and direction. With the inspiration of Vidya Vinod Shri Sukhanmuniji, this work progressed rapidly. The cooperation of Shri Devkumarji Jain was received and the work became ready to take shape in a short time.

**Illumination**

One of the primary and creative objectives of the Shri Marudhar Kesari Sahitya Prakashan Samiti is to publish literature related to Jainism and philosophy. The institution's guiding light, the highly revered Shri Marudhar Kesari Ji M., is himself a great scholar, impromptu poet, and an expert in Jain Agamas and philosophy. Under his guidance, the institution's various philanthropic activities are ongoing. Gurudev Shri is a connoisseur and enthusiast of literature. Inspired by him, we have published discourses, biographies, poetry, Agamas, and profound analytical works. Now, we are presenting to scholars and inquisitive readers their long-awaited work, "Karmagranth" with commentary.

"Karmagranth" is a great text of Jain philosophy. Its six parts contain a comprehensive analysis of Jain philosophy. Under the guidance of the revered Gurudev, renowned author-editor Shri Shri Chand Ji Surana and his associate Shri Devkumar Ji Jain have jointly edited it beautifully. This grand work has been completed beautifully with the inspiration of the ascetic Shri Rajtamuni Ji and the scholar Shri Suknamuni Ji.

We will soon present the complete "Karmagranth" with commentary to readers in other parts. The first part has already reached the hands of readers some time ago. Now this second part is presented before the readers.

Second Edition
'Karmagranth', which comprehensively elucidates 'Karmavada', is a representative text of Jain 'Karma' theory. While publishing it, we imagined that there would be very few readers for such a profound and esoteric subject, hence we printed only a limited number of copies. But the readers embraced this text with great enthusiasm, it was welcomed everywhere. Like the first part, the edition of the second part also got exhausted, and the demand from readers continued. As a result, this new edition of the second part is presented for the service of the readers.
Despite the exorbitant cost of paper, printing, etc., no change has been made in its price for the convenience of the readers.

## Introduction

The soul is the foundation of all Jain thought, contemplation, and analysis. The soul is an all-powerful, independent force. It is both the creator of its own happiness and sorrow, and the one who experiences the fruits of its actions. The soul itself is formless, perfectly pure, yet it wanders through the world in a state of coldness, ignorance, and impurity. Despite being inherently blissful, it is caught in the cycle of happiness and sorrow. Though eternal and immortal, it is swept away in the flow of birth and death. It is astonishing that the soul, which is supremely powerful, is also experiencing suffering and hardship in the world as a helpless, sorrowful, and impoverished being. What is the reason for this?

Jain philosophy, while examining this reason, states that karma is what causes the soul to wander in the world. Karma is the root of birth and death - "Kammam ca jai maranassa mulan" - this statement of Bhagwan Shri Mahavira is absolutely true, a fact. Due to karma, this universe is constantly changing through various cycles of events. While theistic philosophies attribute the diversity of this world and happiness and sorrow to God, Jain philosophy considers karma as the cause of all happiness, sorrow, and the diversity of the world. Karma itself is not an independent force, it is matter, inert. However, when performed by the soul driven by attachment and aversion, it becomes so powerful and potent that it binds the doer in its chains. It even makes the master its servant. This is the extraordinary power of karma. All of our lives and the world around us...

What is this main seed of transformations, Karma? What is its nature? How are its diverse results? This is a very serious subject. Jain philosophy describes Karma in great detail. A very subtle and profound discussion of Karma is found in Jain Agamas and subsequent texts. Because it is in Prakrit and Sanskrit languages, it is for the learned, but it is difficult for the ordinary seeker. Ancient Acharyas have woven together the various forms of Karma theory in chunks, which proves to be a good source of knowledge for the ordinary seeker of truth when memorized. The Karmagranth occupies an important place in the ancient texts of Karma theory. The six parts of Srimad Devendrasur's work are very important. They present a discussion of all Jain philosophy-approved Karmavada, Munasthan, Margana, Jiva, Ajiva, their distinctions and sub-distinctions, etc. The original text is in Prakrit language and many commentaries on it are also famous in Sanskrit. Its discussion is also quite famous in Gujarati. Pandit Sukhlalji, a famous scholar and sage, prepared a discussion on it in Hindi language about 40 years ago. _ Currently, the Hindi discussion of Karmagranth was becoming difficult to obtain, and by this time, the style of discussion had also changed considerably. Many seekers of truth, Munivar and devout Shravaks, had been requesting for many years from the most revered Gurudev Marudhar Kesariji M. Sa. that a new style of discussion and publication of such a vast and serious text like Karmagranth should be done. Only a capable scholar, scholar and great saint like you can accomplish this very laborious and expensive task. Gurudevshri was also attracted to this. The body has become quite old. Even in this, long travels and many institutions

Organizing Programs! In your busy life, you still spend 10-12 hours or more engaged in scriptural study, literary creation, etc. Last year, Gurudevshri resolved to take this work forward. He began writing the *vivechana*. The responsibility for making the *vivechana* beautiful and interesting in terms of language style, etc., and for collecting footnotes, citations from the *Agamas*, writing the introduction, etc., was entrusted to the renowned scholar Shri Shri Chand Ji Surana 'Saras'. Shri Surana Ji is in very close contact with Gurudevshri's literature and thoughts! Under Gurudev's guidance, he has worked very hard to make this scholarly work useful for the general public. This *vivechana* is fulfilling a long-standing need. At the same time, society is receiving a cultural and philosophical treasure in a new form, which is a matter of great joy.
I have a special interest in this subject. I have been encouraging Gurudev and the editorial team to complete it from time to time. After the first part, this second part is now coming before the public. I am very happy about it.

According to the Harga Siddhanta, the basis of acceptance is Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha, these four Purusharthas. Many thinkers have expressed their views on these from their own perspectives. Those who consider this visible world to be the only reality, they considered Artha and Kama Purusharthas as the main ones and set the goal of life as acquiring wealth in some way or the other. Therefore, they were not bound to accept any principle, nor were they eager to accept any principle that would lead to good or bad, rebirth or attainment of the afterlife. This side became known as the Charvaka Darshan tradition, whose sole aim is:

"Live happily as long as you live, drink after taking a loan. Where is the return of the body that has been reduced to ashes?"

But along with this, there has been and still is a widespread thought that accepts another superior or inferior realm beyond the visible world, the existence of rebirth after death. Therefore, Dharma and Moksha Purusharthas were also accepted. Happiness in the afterlife and rebirth is not possible without accepting Dharma and Moksha Purusharthas. Its meaning is that "if there are no Karmas, then the relationship of birth-rebirth, this world and the afterlife cannot be properly established. Therefore, the concept of rebirth...

Page #16:
---------------------------
(18) The belief in karma is the basis of the karmic system. Those who hold this belief are called reincarnationists. Two schools of thought on the theory of karma:

There are two schools of thought among these karma theorists. One school of thought is that rebirth and the afterlife are inevitable as a result of karma, but for a superior world and a superior birth, karma must also be superior. Their conception of a superior world is limited to heaven. They believe in the three goals of life: dharma, artha, and kama. In their view, moksha has no place as a goal of life. Therefore, they are called tripurushartha-vadis.

The essence of these tripurushartha-vadi thinkers is that the fruit of good deeds is heaven and the fruit of bad deeds is hell, etc. This dharma and adharma are called punya-papa or adrishta, and through them the cycle of birth-rebirth, heaven-hell continues. Its destruction is not possible, but it is possible that if one wants to attain a superior world and superior happiness, then one should perform the dharma purushartha. Adharma-papa is to be avoided and dharma-punya is to be adopted. Their belief in dharma and adharma is that socially acceptable good conduct is dharma and reprehensible conduct is adharma. Therefore, one should behave in a refined manner for the sake of social order. This school of thought became famous by the name of pravartanadharma. Wherever pravartanadharma is mentioned, it is indicative of the views of these tripurushartha-vadi thinkers. They are known as Brahman-marg, Mimamsaka or Karmakandi.

On the contrary, the views of the other supporters of the karma-tattva-vadis are stated...

Page #17:
---------------------------
This is fundamentally different from the proponents of *pravratak dharma* and *tripurushartha*. They believe that karma is indeed the cause of rebirth. By performing righteous and prescribed actions (deeds), one can attain heaven. But being content with attaining heaven is not the goal of the soul, nor is it the fulfillment of the soul's purpose. Where is the attainment of the soul's independent, pure form in this? Therefore, for the attainment of the self-nature and the fulfillment of the purpose, *dharma-punya* is as objectionable as *adharma-papa*. According to them, the fourth *moksha* purpose is independent, and *moksha* is the only goal of the soul. For *moksha*, both *punya-rupa* and *papa-rupa* karma are necessary. Not only that, *diyi* cannot be destroyed. Karma can be destroyed by effort. This ideology became known as *nivartak dharma*. Its vision is not limited to the social system, but is primarily individualistic (self-developmental). An individual can achieve the ultimate goal by developing himself through his own efforts. The *nivartak dharma* view on karma

According to the *nivartak dharma* view, ultimate karma cessation is possible, and it is possible only through the efforts of the soul itself. Indicating the root cause of the origin of karma, it is said that the root cause of *dharma-punya* and *adharma-papa* is not the prevailing social tendencies-rejections, prohibitions, but ignorance and attachment-aversion. No matter how righteous the social behavior may be, if it is based on ignorance and attachment-aversion, it will give rise to *adharma*. This distinction between *punya* and *papa* is for those who have a gross vision. In reality, *punya* and *papa*, being based on ignorance and attachment-aversion, are *adharma* and objectionable. Therefore, self-independence

Page #18:
---------------------------
For the ignorant and the society-prescribed customs based on attachment and aversion are also to be abandoned like the sinful karmas rooted in adharma, and their eradication is essential.
When the Nivartaka Dharmavadis accepted the eradication of karma and liberation as the main purushartha, it became necessary to determine the causes that eradicate karma and lead to liberation. Therefore, since the tendency towards karma is born out of ignorance and attachment-aversion, the main remedy for its complete eradication was considered to be Samyagjnana, which is opposed to ignorance, and Samabhava (Samyakcharitra), which is opposed to attachment-aversion, and these were considered as the means.  Swadhyaya, tapas, dhyana, etc. were accepted as aids to Samyagjnana and Samyama.
When the Nivartaka Dharmavadis deeply contemplated the nature of liberation and the means of attaining it, they also had to contemplate the karma tattva. They also defined karma, its divisions, and the definitions of its divisions. They classified karmas from the perspective of cause and effect. They discussed their power to bear fruit, their time limits, etc. They also considered the mutual relationship of karmas, the power of the soul, etc., and systematically discussed everything else that was necessary in this regard. In this way, the systematic contemplation of the Nivartaka Dharmavadis on the subject of karma led to the creation of a good karma shastra. The difference of opinion among the Nivartaka Dharmavadis regarding the karma theory is that their general opinion is that by destroying the root of karma in some way or the other, one should attain that state from which one does not return to the cycle of birth and death.

Page #19:
---------------------------
(21) Having attained the ultimate cessation of karmas, the soul, free from all attachments, attains the supreme state. However, due to different processes of philosophical inquiry, variations are observed in the understanding of these principles. There are mainly three types: (1) Atomistic, (2) Principalist, and (3) Atomistic with an element of the Principal. 

Among these, the Atomistic view, while advocating for liberation, is not as opposed to the Dharma of Conduct as the second and third types of thinkers. This view became known as the Nyaya-Vaisheshika philosophy.

The second view is the Principalist. This view, advocating for the ultimate cessation of karmas, considers the Dharma of Conduct as undesirable. This view is known as the Samkhya-Yoga philosophy. Based on the role of this philosophy, the Vedanta philosophy and the path of renunciation gained prominence.

The third view is that of the Atomistic with an element of the Principal. This view, like the second, is fundamentally opposed to the Dharma of Conduct and is known as Jain philosophy. Buddhist philosophy is also considered opposed to the Dharma of Conduct, but it is considered a later development, a blend of the second and third views.

While Buddhist and Samkhya philosophies have considered the principle of karma, they later focused their thought on the path of meditation, leading to a one-sided perspective. As a result, their contribution to the literature on karma is negligible, and what exists does not contribute to the development of thought. However, Jain thinkers, like their contemplation on other subjects, have also deeply explored the principle of karma.

Page #20:
---------------------------
(22)
Through deep thought and subtle contemplation, Indian philosophy has made a great contribution that is unique and unparalleled in itself. The framework of karma in Jain philosophy, while outlining the characteristics of karma, its divisions, and sub-divisions, considers three stages for each karma: bondage, existence, and fruition. These stages of karma are also described in other philosophies. They call bondage 'kriyaman', existence 'mantrit', and fruition 'prarabdh'. However, the way Jain philosophy explains the different experiential states of the embodied soul through eight karmas, including jnanavarniya, and their sub-divisions, is not found in other philosophies. Even in Patanjali's philosophy, karma is categorized into three types of consequences: jati (birth), ayu (lifespan), and bhog (enjoyment). But compared to Jain philosophy's views on karma, this description appears unclear and insignificant.

Jain philosophy clearly defines the nature of the soul and karma, explaining how karma is connected to the soul, its causes, the reasons for the development of different powers in karma, the duration of the connection between the soul and karma, its minimum and maximum time limits, the duration for which karma can bear fruit, whether the time for karma to bear fruit can be changed, and if so, what self-transformations are necessary for it. What self-transformations can transform the intensity of karma from strong to weak and vice versa? How is the inherently pure soul stained by the influence of karma, and why does the soul not deviate from its nature even when covered by the veils of karma?  These are some of the questions about the bondage, existence, and...

Page #21:
---------------------------
(23)
A detailed and comprehensive explanation of the countless questions arising from the concept of *udaya* (arising) is provided in Jain Karma literature.
Jain Karma Shastra describes various stages of karma, generally categorized as *bandha* (binding), *satta* (existence), *udaya* (arising), *udirana* (stimulation), *udvartana* (ascent), *apvartana* (descent), *sanक्रमण* (transition), *upashmana* (mitigation), *nidhatti* (destruction), *nikachan* (extraction), and *abada* (unhindered). This classification comprehensively explains the power of karma and the soul's capacity, enabling it to break free from the cycle of birth and death and attain its true nature.
Classification of Differences
Based on the aforementioned concise outline of Jain philosophy on karma, the discussion reveals the progression of the soul's power, demonstrating the gradual decline of *bandha*, *satta*, and *udaya* stages of karma due to the soul's purity.
Now, we delve into the "Karmastava" (second Karma text). This text primarily focuses on the soul's increasing progress along this path of development.
The purpose of composing the second Karma text is to elaborate on the soul's capacity for *bandha*, *udaya*, and *udirana* of karma, while the first Karma text, "Karmavipak," outlined the fundamental and derived natures of karma and their *bandha*, *udaya*, *udirana*, and *satta* potential.
Style of Subject Description
There are countless beings in the world. Therefore, it is impossible to illustrate the capacity for *bandha* and other aspects of karma based on a single individual.

Page #22:
---------------------------
(24) No. In addition, a person's qualifications related to karma, etc., are not always the same, because the qualifications related to karma, etc., change constantly due to the changing results and thoughts every moment. Therefore, the spiritualists have classified worldly beings based on their inner purification-induced evolution and impurity-induced devolution. This classification is called 'Gunasthan Krama' in the classical definition.

This order of Gunasthan is such that it makes it easy to include all worldly beings in those divisions and to explain their suitability related to karma, etc. And the ability of a being, which changes constantly, can also be demonstrated by some division. This order of Gunasthan has been established and eliminated by a psychoanalytic examination of the fluid nature of the inner purity of worldly beings. This makes it easy to tell and understand that a certain type of inner purity or impurity is the cause of so many karmic natures, bondage, rise-excitation, and existence.

A brief discussion of Gunasthan
The places of qualities (soul powers), i.e., the gradual stages of the soul's development, are called Gunasthan. In Jain philosophy, 'Gunasthan' is a technical term and its meaning is the state of the soul's powers emerging - their pure function form - becoming manifest in the form of tamas-bhaava.

The true nature of the soul is pure consciousness and complete bliss, but as long as the three karmic coverings are overshadowing it, then its...

Page #23:
---------------------------
(25) The true nature is not visible. As the coverings are shed or destroyed, the true nature is revealed. When the coverings are in their most intense state, the soul is at the lowest level of its undeveloped state. This is the lowest level of the soul's state, and when the coverings are completely destroyed, the soul becomes stable in the fullness of its pure nature. That is its complete nature. The highest, supreme, and unchangeable state. As the intensity of the coverings of karma on the soul decreases, the soul gradually gains the benefit of its pure nature, leaving its primary role and moving towards the highest role. In this transitional state, the soul experiences many kinds of high and low consequential states, which, while moving towards upliftment, also bring it back to a lower role, and again from that lower role, it moves towards upliftment with its specific consequences. This process continues, and finally, by the strength of the soul's power, it overcomes those states and attains the ultimate goal. These transitional states, from the beginning to the end and in the middle, have been classified into fourteen divisions, which are called the fourteen Gunasthanas.

The basis of Gunasthanas is the predominance of Mohkarma in karmas, therefore its covering is the most prominent. That is, as long as Moh is strong and intense, all other karma coverings remain strong and intense, and as Moh weakens, the state of other coverings also weakens. Therefore, the main obstacle in the development of the soul is the strength of Moh, and the main helper is the weakening of Moh.

---------------------------
(26)

It is for this reason that the sequential stages of the soul's development are based on the intensity, mildness, and absence of *guna-sthana* and *moha-shakti*.

The primary powers of *moha* are two: *darshan-moha* and *charitra-moha*. The first power prevents the soul from having *darshan*, i.e., the discernment of its true nature and form. The second power, even after the soul has gained discernment, prevents it from acting accordingly. In practice, it is also seen that when the true nature of an object is perceived, an effort is made to obtain or avoid that object. For the soul progressing in spiritual development, these are the two main tasks: *swaroop-darshan* and acting accordingly, i.e., being established in one's true nature. Of these two powers, the power that prevents the knowledge of one's true nature is called *darshan-moha*, and the power that prevents one from being established in one's true nature is called *charitra-moha*. Of these, the first power, in the form of *darshan-moha*, can never be weak as long as the second power, in the form of *charitra-moha*, is strong. As the first power becomes weaker and weaker, the second power also becomes weaker accordingly. When the knowledge of one's true nature is attained, the path to attaining the benefits of one's true nature becomes easy.

The most covered state of the soul is the first *guna-sthana*, which is called the *mithyatva guna-sthana*. In this, due to the strongest influence of both powers of *moha*, the soul remains in a state that is completely inferior to the spiritual state. Nevertheless, an infinite part of that power remains revealed. In this role, no matter how much the soul achieves material prosperity, it remains almost empty from the perspective of the knowledge of its true nature. But the soul's nature is to develop, so knowingly or unknowingly, when the veil of *moha* begins to diminish, it progresses towards development and, while mitigating the most intense *raga* and *dvesha*, it weakens *moha*.

Page #25:
---------------------------
। 27) First, the soul manifests the strength to shatter the power of karma. This is the role of the beginning of development.
Even when the path of self-realization is paved, the results of the soul sometimes become upward-facing, sometimes downward-facing. This continues until the self-results become stable. This stability is achieved in two ways - either the covering of self-realization is completely destroyed or the covering is subdued (calm). In the state of being subdued, the covering shows its effect when the opportunity arises, but when it is destroyed, it is considered to be the state of self-realization.
After the development of the power of perception, the order of the development of the power of character comes. Even after weakening the main power of attachment - perception attachment - and realizing the true self, the soul cannot attain its true state until the second power - character attachment - is weakened. Therefore, it strives to subdue the second power of attachment. When it is able to partially weaken that power, its evolution begins to become more upward-facing. As this state increases, so does the stability of the true self.
Even in this state, the soul that has subdued perception attachment can fall from self-realization and return to its initial state, and then all the previous results of purification, etc., become useless. But the soul that has completely destroyed perception attachment attains perfection and then rests.

Page #26:
---------------------------
(28) In these fourteen divisions of Gunasthana, the amount of development in the subsequent Gunasthana is greater than the previous one, the third greater than the second, and so on. This order of development depends on the degree of spiritual stability. The degree of stability depends on the purity of the power of Darshan and Charitramoha. In the first, second, and third Gunasthana, the development of the soul's Darshan and Charitra power does not occur because they are dominated by their restrictive causes. From the fourth Gunasthana onwards, these restrictive Samskaras become weaker, which initiates the process of development of powers in those respective Gunasthanas. These restrictive Samskaras are called Kshayas.

There are four main divisions of these Kshayas. These divisions are based on the intensity of the fruit-bearing power of the Kshayik Samskaras. The first division is of Darshanmohaniya and Anantanabandi Kshayas. This division restricts the Darshan power. The remaining three divisions, which are called Apratyakhyanabaran, Pratyakhyanabaran, and Sanjwalan respectively, are restrictive of the Charitra power. When the intensity of the first division is present, the Darshan power does not manifest, but as the state of weakness or absence develops, the Darshan power is expressed.

When the Darshan power is expressed, or in other words, when the velocity of Darshanmoha and Anantanabandi Kshayas is calmed or destroyed, at the end of the fourth Gunasthana,
1. This statement is from a general perspective. Actually, the second Gunasthana is not a stage of development, but rather a temporary abode for a soul that has fallen from a higher state.

Page #27:
---------------------------
The *apratyakhyanavaran kshaya* karmas are not present. In the fifth *gunasthan*, the *charitra shakti* develops primarily. Subsequently, at the end of the fifth *gunasthan*, the *pratyakhyanavaran kshaya* karmas cease to exist, further enhancing the *charitra shakti*. This leads to detachment from the senses, transforming the being into a *sadhu* (ascetic). This is the sixth stage of development. In this stage, the *charitra* is still subject to disturbances due to the presence of the opposing *sanjwalan kshaya* karmas. However, the *charitra shakti* does not weaken. There are continuous obstacles to purity and stability, and the soul constantly struggles against these disruptive factors. When the soul overcomes these obstacles and continues to progress, surpassing the seventh and subsequent *gunasthanas*, it reaches the twelfth *gunasthan*. In the twelfth *gunasthan*, the opposing karmas of *darshan shakti* and *charitra shakti* are completely destroyed, leading to the full development of both powers. In this state, the being attains the state of *jivanmukta* *arihant* due to the continued presence of the body, lifespan, etc. Later, upon the separation from the body, etc., the soul attains the state of pure knowledge, *darshan*, etc. The *jivanmukta* state is the thirteenth, and the state of complete liberation without the body, etc., is the fourteenth *gunasthan*. The soul that attains the fourteenth *gunasthan* develops into its true form and attains a permanently stable state. This is called *moksha*. The complete absence of the soul's powers in their most subtle form is the first *mithyatva gunasthan*, and the gradual development and manifestation of the soul's complete form, culminating in its own essence, is the fourteenth *ayogikevali gunasthan*.

Page #28:
---------------------------
This is the place. This fourteenth Gunasthan is the identification of the divinity, the Paramatmatva, seen in the fourth Gunasthan. The Gunasthanas from the second to the thirteenth, between the first and fourteenth Gunasthanas, are the names of the achievements obtained as a result of the duel between karma and the soul. These are the links in the chain of the Gunasthanas, which are the roles that the soul has to play in the path of gradual development.

Here is a very brief outline of the Gunasthanas. The names of the Gunasthanas, their systematic and detailed description, are given in the second chapter of this book. In other books, the discussion about Gunasthanas is similar to the Janadarshan. In other philosophies too, the development of the soul has been considered. In them too, it is believed that the karma-bound soul gradually develops and attains complete liberation. In books like Yoga Vashishtha and Patanjali Yoga Sutras, the roles of self-development have been described in detail. Yoga Vashishtha has considered seven roles of ignorance and seven roles of knowledge. Their names are as follows:

Roles of Ignorance: 1. Beejajagrat, 2. Jagrat, 3. Mahajagrat, 4. Jagratswapna, 5. Swapna, 6. Swapnajagrat, 7. Sushuptak.

Roles of Knowledge: 1. Shubhechcha, 2. Vicharana, 3. Tanumansa, 4. Sattvapatti, 5. Asansakti, 6. Padarthaabhavini, 7. Turyaga.

The summary of the above 14 roles is as follows:

1. Beejajagrat: In this role, the awareness of ego and possessiveness does not awaken. But there is the ability to awaken in the form of a seed. This role is considered in small bodies like plants etc.

Page #29:
---------------------------
(31)
2. **Jagrat** - In this state, the ego and possessiveness are slightly awakened.
3. **Mahajagrat** - In this state, the ego and possessiveness are strengthened. This state can be considered as human or divine.
4. **Jagratswapna** - In this state, there is an element of delusion even while awake. For example, seeing two moons instead of one, or the illusion of silver in a shell. Due to the presence of delusion, this state is called Jagratswapna.
5. **Swapna** - The perception of a dream after waking up from sleep is called the Swapna state.
6. **Swapnajagrat** - This state involves the immersion of a dream that has been ongoing for years. It continues even after the body dies.
-
7. **Sushuptak** - A state like deep sleep. In this state, there is a state of inertia, and karmas remain only in the form of desires.

This is a summary of the seven states of ignorance. The third to seventh states occur in the human body. The states of knowledge are as follows:

1. **Shubhechcha** - A desire with a lineage of self-reflection.
2. **Vicharana** - A tendency towards good conduct due to the study of scriptures and the practice of detachment through good company.
3. **Tanumansa** - A decrease in attachment to sense objects due to Shubhechcha and Vicharana.
4. **Sattvapatti** - Being established in the true and pure self.

Page #30:
---------------------------
(32) (5) The emergence of supreme joy in the mind due to the ripening of non-attachment and non-association.
(6) Padarthaabhavini - In this, all desires for external and internal objects are destroyed.
(7) Turyaga - Being stable in one's own nature by completely forgetting the awareness of discrimination. This is a state like that of a Jivanmukta. The state of Videhamukti is the Turyatita state that follows it.

The seven stages of ignorance can be counted in the order of involution due to the strength of ignorance, and the seven stages of knowledge can be counted in the order of evolution due to the gradual increase of knowledge.

Buddhist philosophy also contemplates the evolution of the soul and considers the states of the soul such as samsara and moksha. The Tripitaka describes spiritual development, which outlines the following six stages of development:
(1) Andha Puthujjana, (2) Kalyana Puthujjana, (3) Sotapanna, (4) Sakadagami, (5) Aupapatika, (6) Arhat.

Puthujjana means ordinary human being. Two distinctions have been made between Andha Puthujjana and Kalyana Puthujjana. Just as Jain Agamas describe karma, Buddhist literature also describes ten samyojanas (bondages).

Andha Puthujjana and Kalyana Puthujjana have ten types of samyojanas. However, the difference between the two is that the former does not receive the Aryan vision and good company, while the latter does. Both are far from the path of Nirvana. To attain the path of Nirvana,

Page #31:
---------------------------
(33)
There are four types of beings: those who have destroyed three of the ten fetters are called Sotapanna, those who have destroyed three and weakened two are called Sakadagami, and those who have destroyed five are called Anagami. Those who have destroyed all ten fetters are called Arhat.

The first stage represents the time of spiritual underdevelopment. In the second, there is a slight glimmer of development, but the influence of underdevelopment is more pronounced than development. The third to sixth stages represent the progressive increase of spiritual development, which culminates in the sixth stage - Arhat, after which the state of Nirvana is attained.

The Ajivika sect may have also indicated spiritual development through stages. As the leader of the Ajivika sect, Mankhaliputra Goshalak is considered a rival of Lord Mahavira. Therefore, he must have conceived of something like the Gunasthanas to explain spiritual development. However, since no literature of his is available, nothing can be said for certain. Nevertheless, Buddhist literature mentions eight stages of spiritual development in the Ajivika sect:
(1) Mand, (2) Khidda, (3) Pad Vimana, (4) Ujjugat, (5) Sekh, (6) Saman, (7) Jin, (8) Panna.

Buddhaghosa, in his Sumangalavilasini commentary on the Majjhima Nikaya, describes these eight stages as follows:
(1) Mand - From birth to seven days, the being remains in the Mand state due to the pain of birth.

Page #32:
---------------------------
(2) A child born from *khidda-durgati* (hellish existence) cries repeatedly, while a child born from *sugati* (heavenly existence) remembers *sugati* and laughs. This is the *khidda* (play) role.
(3) *Pad Bimamsa* is when a child takes its first steps on earth, either with the support of its parents or someone else.
(4) *Ujjugat* is when a child gains the ability to walk independently.
(5) *Sekh* is the role of a student during the time of learning crafts, arts, etc.
(6) *Saman* is the role of leaving home and taking monastic vows.
(7) *Jin* is the role of attaining knowledge by worshipping the *Acharya*.
(8) *Pann* is the role of a wise monk who has become *prajna* (enlightened) and does not engage in any conversation, a selfless *Shraman*.

These eight roles, the first three indicate a lack of development, while the last five indicate development. After them, there should be liberation.

The aforementioned *Patangala*, *Buddhist*, and *Ajivika* views on the roles for self-development do not have the same systematic order and clarity as the *Gunasthanas* (stages of spiritual progress) in Jainism. However, they are mentioned because these philosophies, which believe in rebirth and the existence of this world and the next, have contemplated the liberation of the soul from its bound state.

The subject matter of the text and the basis of its composition: This second Karmagrantha describes the bondage, arising, stimulation, and existence of the lower natures in the order of the Gunasthanas. Therefore, from the perspective of subject division, it has these four main divisions. In the Bondage section, the bondage capacity of each being residing in each Gunasthana is shown, and in the Arising, Stimulation, and Existence sections, the capacities related to arising, stimulation, and existence are shown respectively.

This text is based on the ancient Karmagrantha called "Karmastava," and its subject matter is the same. The only difference between the two is that the ancient Karmagrantha has 55 verses, while this one has 34. What is said in detail in the ancient text is said in a limited number of words in this one.

The author of this Karmagrantha, which is based on the ancient one, has not mentioned the name "Karmastava" at the beginning of the text. However, there is no doubt that it is called "Karmastava." Because another author has mentioned this name in the last verse of his third Karmagrantha with the phrase "Neyam Kammatyayam Soum."

In practice, the ancient Karmagrantha is called "Karmastava," but it is clear from its initial verse that its real name is "Bandhodayasattwa-yukta Stada." There is also a chapter with this name in the Gommatasar Karmakanda. There is no significant difference between the two names. Although both names contain the word "stava," the meaning of the word "staba" is different in the Gommatasar Karmakanda. In "Karmastava," the word "stava" means praise, which is well-known, but in the Gommatasar, the meaning of "stava" is...

Page #34:
---------------------------
The term "Stuti" has been used here in a symbolic sense, referring to a scripture that elaborates on all aspects of a subject, either in detail or in summary.  _ Thus, even though there is similarity in the subject matter and nomenclature, the difference in name and meaning seems to be a result of differences in tradition and the time and place of the composition of the text.

Some points have been indicated in the preface. Readers, by studying the text based on these ideas and observing other texts of Karma literature, will experience a special joy.

Taha Thuninimo Veerajinam Maha Gunthanesu Sayalakammai.
Bandhudaodiranayasattapattaani Khayiyani ||1|| Gathaarth- Shree Veer Jinendra has destroyed all karmas in the Gunasthanas, including Bandha, Uday, Udirana, and Sattasthan. We pray that we may also be able to do the same. Vishesharth- This gatha indicates the subject matter to be discussed in the granth, while praising Shree Veerajineshwara.
Praise is done in two ways... by pranam and by describing extraordinary qualities. This gatha includes both types of praise, because describing extraordinary and real qualities is called praise. The complete destruction of all karmas is an extraordinary and real quality of Bhagwan Mahavira. He did not destroy karmas in just one state, but destroyed all karmas in all states, including Bandha, Uday, Udirana, and Satya, and attained the Sachchidanandamya Atmaswaroop.

The salutation has been done. This is a praise in the form of गुणानुवाद by the author and a salutation in the form of प्रणाम by the verb थपिमो' in the verse.
Action does not happen without a cause. The wandering of the soul in the world is an action and its cause is karma. As long as the soul remains in the world, there are states of karma like अन्ध, उदय, etc. But as the destruction of karma reduces the binding of new karma, the power of karma also gradually becomes निस्सत्व - निश्शेष and the spiritual qualities gradually develop, and finally, when karma is completely destroyed, the soul attains the form of शुभ आत्मम्वरूप.
The attainment of this pure आत्मस्वरूप by the soul is called मोक्ष. But as long as there is no lack of the ability to bind new karma and the complete निर्जरा of past karma, it is possible for karma to be चन्धन. There are not only two states of karma, बन्ध and क्षय, but also other states like फल देना, etc. These states of karma are mainly called बन्ध, उदय, उदीरणा, सत्ता. Among these states, बन्धावस्था is the main one, and only when बन्ध happens, do states like उदय, उदीरणा, सत्ता, etc. occur. The description of these states is being done in this text in order. Their characteristics are as follows:
बन्ध - मिथ्यात्व, अविरत, प्रमाद, कषाय, परिणत in the causes of योग in the form of शानावरणादि, the merging of the subtle कर्मपुद्गलों with the soul like milk and water in the same field, अनन्तानन्त प्रदेश वाले, is called बन्ध. Due to मिथ्यात्वादि, the soul takes in कर्म योग्य पुद्गलों and due to the bound कर्मपुद्गलों,

Page #40:
---------------------------
## Second Karma Granth

The Jiva continuously undergoes transformations like Mithyatva (falsehood) and others. Thus, these two are interdependent.

**Uday** (fruition) is the experience of auspicious and inauspicious fruits when the **Udayakal** (time of fruition) arrives. In other words, it is the experience of the bound karma, as per the state of the bound karma or as per the intensity or reduction of karma due to Apvartana (reduction) and Udvartana (increase), etc.

During the **Bandhanakal** (time of binding), the Kashayik Adhyavasayas (passions) that are the cause of karma, develop the power to give intense or mild fruits in each karma, according to their intensity. Accordingly, when the Udayakal arrives, one has to experience the karma-phala (fruits of karma). This power to give fruits resides in the karma itself and gives fruits according to that karma, not according to the nature of another karma.

The experience of karma does not happen immediately after binding, but begins after a certain period of time. This period of time is called **Avadhakal** (time of latency). For example, even if water is boiling in a pot, the object placed in it for cooking will sit at the bottom of the pot for some time before it starts cooking. Similarly, the state and time of sitting at the bottom should be understood as Avadhakal.

However, this Avadhakal is different for each karma, depending on its own state.

1. The time when the fruits of a karma are experienced after the Avadhakal has passed is called **Udayakal**.
2. The time during which the soul does not experience the auspicious and inauspicious fruits of the remaining karma is called **Avadhakal**.

Page #41:
---------------------------
Karma, according to its nature, varies. Sometimes it passes naturally in its uninterrupted course, and sometimes, due to the combination of a particular cause and a particular potency, it also becomes exhausted. The completion of this uninterrupted course of karma is called 'Apvarthanakaran'.

Just as the state and essence of karmas bound by a particular potency can be reduced, similarly, karma can be transformed from its own nature into its homologous nature by a particular potency. This transformation of karma into its own homologous karmic nature by a particular potency is called 'Samkranti'.

The original natures of karmas do not transform into each other. However, the sub-divisions of the original karma can transform, or they may not. For example, 'Jnanaavaranakarma' is the original karmic nature, and 'Matijnanaavaran', 'Shrutajnanaavaran', etc. are its sub-natures. Among these, 'Matijnanaavaran' karma can transform into 'Shrutajnanaavaran' karma, or 'Shrutajnanaavaran' karma can transform into 'Matijnanaavaran', etc. This is because these natures are homologous to each other, being sub-divisions of the original karma 'Jnanaavaran', and they only cover knowledge, but they do not have the capacity to cover other qualities of the soul.

In other words, 'Jnanaavaran' does not transform into 'Darshanavaran', and 'Darshanavaran' does not transform into 'Jnanaavaran' karma. This is because these two karmas have different natures and they have the capacity to perform different functions. They can only function according to their own nature, but they do not have the power to abandon their original nature. If the original natures of karmas were to abandon their original nature, then the entire karmic system would be disrupted.

Page #42:
---------------------------
## Second Karma Granth

**If you remove the nature of things, their existence will not remain, and the number will not be fixed.**

**5**

**I**

Although it is certain that the original natures of karmas do not transition, there are many sub-natures within the Uttaraprakritis that also do not transition with each other, even if they are of the same type. For example, Darshanmoha and Charitramoha. Both are sub-natures of Mohaniya Karma, but Darshanmoha does not transition into Charitramoha, or vice versa. Similarly, one should understand about the Uttaraprakritis of Anukarma that Narakayu does not transition into Tiryanchayu or any other Ayu.

**Udirana:** Bringing forth karmas into fruition by the special power of the soul, even without the attainment of the Udayakal (time of fruition), is called Udirana. In other words, even after the unobstructed time has passed, those karmas that are about to come into fruition from behind are brought into the Udayavalika (period of fruition) by special effort and made to experience fruition along with those that have already attained fruition.

**Satta:** The bound karma remaining attached to the soul without abandoning its own nature is called Satta.

For example, if the karmas of Manushya-Gati (human birth) and Manushyanupurvi (human-like qualities) are bound, then both will be considered to have attained their own nature due to being bound. As long as both remain in their own nature, their Satta will be considered.

Even though Mithyatva-Mohaniya Karma is bound and has the nature of Satta, its ability to bear fruit diminishes, resulting in two further divisions: Ardha-Rasa (half-ripe) and Norasa-Praya (almost unripe). Even when these two are not bound, the Satta of Mishra-Mohaniya (mixed-delusion) and Samyaktva-Mohaniya (right-belief delusion) is considered.

Page #43:
---------------------------
Karma is yours,
it is yours. Because both these natures, without bondage, have attained their own form and thus proved their existence.
All these karmas, with their bondage and other states, were not destroyed by Bhagwan Mahavira in a moment. But by their gradual destruction, he developed the powers of the soul in a series, one after another, and became the Supreme Soul, the Omniscient, the All-seeing. This is the order of the development of the powers of the soul, and every soul has to make its own efforts for this.
The special qualities that are known by the wax of knowledge, vision, character, etc., due to the efforts made by the soul for its development, are called Gunasthanas. That is, Gunas - knowledge, vision, character, etc. are the nature of the soul and Sthanas - the form attained by them due to their intensity, are called Gunasthanas.
These special forms - knowledge, vision, character, etc. are the states of purity and impurity of these qualities. The main reason for the intensity of purity and impurity of qualities is the rise, subsidence, destruction, and destruction-subsidence of Mohaniya karma. When the obstructive karma decreases, the purity of knowledge, vision, etc. qualities becomes more apparent, and when the obstructive karma increases, the purity of knowledge, etc. qualities decreases. This gradual development of the soul's qualities, from less to more, is called Gunasthanakrama. Although there can be countless types of special forms of the soul born from purity and impurity, all these special forms are included in the form of fourteen Gunasthanas in brief. These Gunasthanas are like steps to attain the Moksha Mahal.

Page #44:
---------------------------
## Second Karma Granth

This section describes the binding, arising, stimulation, and existence of different types of karmas in each of the Gunasthanas. The number and nature of these karmas will be explained in the following verses.

The names of the Gunasthanas are: Mithyatva, Sasvadan, Mise, Avirat, Desevirat, Pamatt, Apamatt, Niyatti, Aniyatti, Suhmusam, Khona, Sajogi, and Ajoigi. 

**Explanation:** Before explaining the binding and other states of karmas in the Gunasthanas, it is necessary to mention the names of these Gunasthanas. This verse lists the names of the Gunasthanas. These names are:

1. Mithyatva
2. Sasvadan (Sasaadan)
3. Mith (Samyagmithyadristi)
4. Avirat Samyagdristi
5. Desevirat
6. Pamatt Samyata
7. Apamatt Samyata
8. Nivritti (Apuurvakaran)
9. Anivritti Vadar Samparaya
10. Sukshma Samparaya
11. Upashanta Moha-Vitaraag
12. Ksheena Mohaa-Vitaraag
13. Sayogikevali
14. Ajoigikevali

The word "Gunasthan" should be added to each of these names. For example, Mithyatva Gunasthan, etc.

The order of these Gunasthanas reflects a systematic progression of the soul's spiritual development. Each Gunasthan represents a higher state than the previous one, indicating...

Page #45:
---------------------------
## Karmastava

**Karmastava** refers to the stages of spiritual progress in Jainism, where the purification of qualities like knowledge, perception, etc., increases in each successive stage. As a result, in the higher stages, there is a greater binding of auspicious qualities compared to inauspicious ones. Eventually, the binding of even auspicious qualities ceases, leading to the attainment of the ultimate goal - the pure, luminous, self-illuminating, and blissful state of liberation (Paramatmapad).

**Arrangement of Gunasthanas:** There are countless beings in the universe, each appearing different based on their senses, knowledge, abilities, and characteristics. However, from a spiritual perspective, these differences can be understood through the arrangement of Gunasthanas.

**Two Types of Beings:** Generally, from a spiritual perspective, there are two types of beings: (1) Mithyatvi - those with false beliefs, and (2) Samyaktvī - those with right beliefs. This means some beings are deeply ignorant and have misguided thoughts, while others are knowledgeable, discerning, and follow the path of righteousness.

**Mithyatvi:** Those who are ignorant and have misguided thoughts are called Mithyatvi. The first Gunasthan, Mithyatva-Mithyadristi, is for such beings.

**Samyaktvī:** Even among those with right beliefs, there are three categories: (1) Those with slight right belief (Swalp Samyaktvī) who are on the verge of losing it, (2) Those with half right belief and half false belief (Ardha Samyaktvī and Ardha Mithyatvī), and (3) Those with pure right belief but without the fourfold virtues (Vishuddha Samyaktvī). The second Gunasthan is for those with slight right belief.

Page #46:
---------------------------
1.
There is no karma for them. Therefore, such beings with a hierarchical status are called the eighth guna-sthana, called Nivritti (Apuvarkarana). _ Although the gradual purity obtained due to the ascent of the hierarchy significantly weakens the passions of the being, the power to re-arise in those passions remains. Therefore, to make the beings aware of such karmic results, the ninth guna-sthana called Anivritti-badarasampraya is mentioned after the eighth.
The beings of the ninth guna-sthana continuously try to destroy the passions, and due to that, a time comes when a glimpse of the passions that are the cause of the world is seen. Such beings are called the tenth guna-sthana, called Sukshmasampraya.   Just as a freckle, a very subtle entity, disappears or is destroyed, so too, the passion-activity, which has become extremely thin, becomes peaceful, subsided, or completely destroyed, causing the being to see its pure and immaculate nature. Thus, to indicate both the peaceful (existing in being) and the destroyed (complete destruction) states, there are the eleventh guna-sthana called Upshanta-moha-vitraga and the twelfth guna-sthana called Kshina-moha-vitraga.  With the destruction of mohaniya karma, along with jnana-avaran, darshan-avaran, and antaraya karma, the being has attained its own inherent qualities of infinite knowledge, vision, etc. But since the connection with the body and other yogas remains, the yoga-युक्त vitragi beings are called the thirteenth guna-sthana, called Sayogikevali, and when they are free from the body and other yogas, pure knowledge

## Second Karma Granth

The manifestation of the soul's true nature, adorned with vision, is described by the fourteenth **guna-sthana** called **Ayogikevali**. Achieving this state is the ultimate goal of the soul, leading to the destruction of the cycle of birth and death, and eternal, pure, **siddh**, **buddha**, and conscious bliss.

The **guna-sthana** are defined as the steps in the soul's evolution. The first is **Mithyatva** and the fourteenth is **Ayogikevali**, representing its completion. Now, we will explain the nature of these **guna-sthana**, starting with **Mithyatva**.

**(1) Mithyatva Guna-sthana:** The soul whose vision (belief, understanding) is distorted due to the influence of **Mithyatva-mohaniya karma** is called **Mithyatvi**. Just as a person who eats datura seeds sees even white objects as yellow, similarly, the **Mithyatvi**'s vision is distorted. They consider false gods as true gods, false gurus as true gurus, and false dharma as true dharma. They lack the knowledge of the soul and its distinction from the non-soul, the conscious and the inert. This specific state of the **Mithyatvi** soul is called **Mithyatva Guna-sthana**. It is also known as **Mithyatva-drishti Guna-sthana**.

**Question:** If distorted vision is called **Mithyatva-drishti**, how can the specific state of the **Mithyatvi** soul be called a **guna-sthana**?

**Answer:** Although the **Mithyatvi**'s vision is distorted, it is also partially true. Because even the **Mithyatvi** recognizes and accepts humans, animals, and birds as humans, animals, and birds respectively. Therefore, this specific state of their consciousness is called a **guna-sthana**.

Just as the sun's rays still shine through dense clouds...

---------------------------
Karma cannot be completely covered, but some part remains open, so that the division of day and night can be made. Similarly, even when Mithyatva-mohaniya karma arises, the Jiva's Drishtigana is not completely covered, but the Mithyatvi's vision is also partially true. Besides this, the Nigodaya Jiva also has a partial use of a kind of Avyaka touch. If this is not accepted, the Nigodaya Jiva will be called Ajiva. Therefore, Mithyatva is considered a Gunasthan.

Question - When we accept that the Mithyatvi's vision is partially true, what is the obstacle in calling and accepting it as Samyagdristi?

Answer - It is true that the Mithyatvi's vision is partially true, but it cannot be called Samyagdristi just because of that. Because the scriptures say that whoever does not believe in even one letter of the Dvadasanga Sutra is Mithyadristi; for example, Jamali. But the characteristic of a Samyaktvi Jiva is that he has complete faith in the statement of the Sarvagna, and the Mithyatvi does not. Therefore, Mithyadristi is not called Samyaktvi.

The Jiva who experiences the Mithya results arising from the rise of Mithyatva-mohaniya karma becomes a person of opposite faith.

1. Even the Jiva who has an infinite number of mohas, is sometimes revealed. If, however, he is considered to be a Jiva, then he will be considered as Ajiva. - Nandhi 75
2. First, he is not awakened, he sleeps and desires. First, he is not awakened, he does not cry in his sleep. The rest cry, but he desires wrongly, like Jamali.

"Just as a being afflicted with jaundice does not find even sweet taste pleasant, similarly, a Mithyatvi does not find true Dharma pleasant."

There are five types of Mithyatva, which arise from the Mithyatva nature and are characterized by faith contrary to Tattvartha: 1) Ekant, 2) Vipreet, 3) Vinay, 4) Sanshay, 5) Agnan.

**Ekant Mithyatva:** To consider a multi-faceted object as having only one facet is Ekant Mithyatva. For example, "All things are entirely transient" or "All things are eternal."

**Vipreet Mithyatva:** To consider the nature of Dharma, etc., in a reversed manner is Vipreet Mithyatva. For example, "Violence leads to heaven, etc."

**Vinay Mithyatva:** To have the same understanding of the scriptures, the Dev, the Guru, and their teachings, both in the case of Samyagdrishti and Mithyadrishti, is Vinay Mithyatva.

**Sanshay Mithyatva:** To not be certain about either of the two types of objects, appropriate and inappropriate, is called Sanshay Mithyatva.

**Agnan Mithyatva:** To not understand the nature of the soul, etc., in a specific way, such as "This is what they are," "This is how they are," is called Agnan Mithyatva.

## Chapter 14

**From the perspective of time, there are three types of Mithyatva:** (1) Anadi-Anant, (2) Anadi-Sant, (3) Sadi-Sant.

**Anadi-Anant Mithyatva** is experienced by Abhavya Jivas, **Anadi-Sant Mithyatva** by Bhavya Jivas, and **Sadi-Sant Mithyatva** by Jivas who fall from a higher Gunasthan to a lower Gunasthan.

**The Stananga Sutra also mentions ten types of Mithyatva:**

(1)  Buddhi of Dharma in Adharma, (2) Buddhi of Adharma in Dharma, (3) Buddhi of Marg in Unmarg, (4) Buddhi of Unmarg in Marg, (5) Buddhi of Jiva in Ajeeva, (6) Buddhi of Ajeeva in Jiva, (7) Buddhi of Sadhu in Asadhu, (8) Buddhi of Asadhu in Sadhu, (9) Buddhi of Murta in Amurta, (10) Buddhi of Amurta in Murta.

**In addition to these ten types mentioned in the Agamas, there are fifteen more types of Mithyatva, including five types like Abhighahik, and ten types like Laukik.** These are not independent types but rather explanations of the ten types of Mithyatva. Their names are as follows:

(1) Abhighahik, (2) Anabhighahik, (3) Abhiniveshik, (4) Sanshayik, (5) Anabhogik, (6) Laukik Mithyatva, (7) Lokottar Mithyatva, (8) Kuprovachinak Mithyatva, (9) Nyun Mithyatva, (10) Adhik Mithyatva, (11) Vipreet Mithyatva, (12) Akriya Mithyatva.

## Second Karma Granth (13) Agnana Mithyatva, (14) Abhinaya Mithyatva, (15) Ashatan Mithyatva.

The aforementioned ten and these fifteen distinctions combined make a total of twenty-five distinctions of Mithyatva. In summary, these can be categorized as Nangik Mithyatva and Paropadeshapurvak Mithyatva.

Mithyatva's lowest state in Gunasthan is Annamuhurta and its highest state is Deshonardha Pudgalparavartan.

(2) Sasvadan Gunasthan - A Jiva with Aupamika Samyaktva, due to the arising of Anantanubandhi Kashaya, abandons Samyaktva and leans towards Mithyatva, but has not yet attained Mithyatva. Until then, that Jiva is called Sasvadan Samyagdristi, and the specific nature of that Jiva is called Sasvadan Samyagdristi.

Just as the time between falling from a mountain and reaching the ground is neither the time of staying on the mountain nor the time of staying on the ground, but a time of experience, similarly, the time of experience between the arising of Anantanubandhi Kashayas, the release from Samyaktva results, and the non-attainment of Mithyatva results, is called Sasvadan Samyagdristi Gunasthan. 1. Leaving the Aharak body, a Jiva, by taking the remaining seven types of Spis, such as Audarik, etc., touches all the Pudgalas of the Lokakasha, which is called Pudgalparavartan. An infinite number of Kalachakra pass in the completion of one Pudgalparavartan. Half of it is called Ardhapudgalparavartan, and one less than half of that is called Devaonardha Pudgalparavartan. (See Special Appendix.)

##  The Taste of Right Faith (Saasvadan Samyagdristi Gunasthan)

Although the inclination of the soul in this Gunasthan is towards falsehood (Mithyatva), just as someone who vomits after eating kheer still experiences the unique taste of kheer, similarly, a Jina who falls from Right Faith (Samyaktva) and turns towards falsehood, experiences the taste of Right Faith for a while. Therefore, this Gunasthan is called the Saasvadan Samyagdristi Gunasthan.

The process of attaining provisional Right Faith (Aupashamik Samyaktva) is as follows:

The soul's inherent taste for truth (Tattvaruchi) arises from the subsidence of the seven natures: Anantanubandhipayachatuv (Anantanubandhi Krodha, Mana, Maya, Lobha) and Darshanamohaniyatrik (Samyaktva, Samyagmidhyatva, and Mithyatva). In this state, the karma particles that induce falsehood remain subdued, like fire buried in ashes, even though they are still present. There are two types of provisional Right Faith: Granthibhedajanaya and Upashamashrenibhaavi.

**Granthibhedajanaya Aupashamik Samyaktva** is attained by the ancient beings (Bhavya Jivas) who have been in falsehood (Mithyatva) since beginningless time. At the time of attainment, the soul performs three actions (Karana - efforts): Yathapravrittikaran, Apurvakaran, and Anivrittikaran. Their process is as follows:

The soul has been wandering in the world for an endless time, experiencing various kinds of suffering. Just as a stone lying in a mountain river becomes round and smooth by rolling and colliding, similarly, the soul, through enduring endless suffering, becomes soft and pure in its results (Parinama). Due to this purification of results, the soul reduces the intensity of the seven karmas (except Ayukarma) to a fraction of a hair's breadth, as small as a single grain of sand compared to the vast ocean. This result...

Page #53:
---------------------------
## Second Kamannya

This is called **Yathapravrittikaran**. A being with **Yathapravrittikaran** reaches the strong knot of attachment and aversion, but cannot break it. This is called **Nandideshapraapti**. This knot of attachment and aversion gradually becomes strong and impenetrable like a tightly woven silk knot. **Yathapravrittikaran** can also happen to **Abhavya** beings: by keeping the state of karma within the **Koda Kodi Sagaropama**, these beings can also reach the **Granthidesha**, but cannot break it.

The result by which a **Bhavya** being breaks the impenetrable knot of attachment and aversion is called **Apuurvakaran**. This result does not come to the being repeatedly, it comes only rarely. Therefore, it is called **Apuurvakaran**. **Yathapravrittikaran** happens to **Abhavya** beings countless times, but **Apuurvakaran** does not happen to **Bhavya** beings many times.

When the knot of attachment and aversion breaks due to **Apuurvakaran**, the being's results become purer, and this is called **Anivrittikaran**. Upon attaining this result, the being does not return without attaining **Samyaktva**. Therefore, it is called **Anivrittikaran**. The state of **Anivrittikaran** lasts for an **Antarmuhurta**. At the time of this **Anivrittikaran** result, the **Veerya** (strength) also increases compared to before.

When the **Antarmuhurta** state of **Anivrittikaran** is about to end, a part of it remains, and the process of **Antarakaran** begins. This means that at the end of **Anivrittikaran**, the **Karmadalikas** of **Mithyanvamohaniya** are moved back and forth. Some **Dalikas** are combined with the **Karmadalikas** that are about to arise at the end of **Anivrittikaran**, and some are combined after the **Antarmuhurta** has passed.

Page #54:
---------------------------
##  Chapter 18

Karma is performed with the accompanying karma-dalikas. This leads to an inter-momentary period after the cessation of the karma, in which there are no karma-dalikas for the Mithyatva-mohaniya. Therefore, for the Mithyatva-mohaniya karma whose abadhā-kāla is complete, there are two divisions. One division is that which remains in manifestation until the extreme time of cessation, and the other is that which comes into manifestation after an inter-momentary period after the cessation. The first division is called the first state of Mithyatva, and the second is called the second state of Mithyatva.

From the beginning of the process of internalization until the end of cessation, Mithyatva remains in manifestation, it does not remain behind. Because at that time, all the dalikas that have the potential to manifest are made capable of manifesting before and after the process of internalization.

After the cessation of the abadhā-kāla, there is Aupaśamika Samyaktvā. Upon attaining Aupaśamika Samyaktvā, the jīva begins to have clear and unambiguous perception. Because at that time, the Mithyatva-mohaniya karma does not manifest in both vipaka and pradeśa. Therefore, the natural Samyaktvā guna of the jīva is expressed. The jīva experiences joy from the removal of the great disease of Mithyatva, just like a person who has been suffering from a chronic and severe illness experiences joy upon recovering. At that time, there is firm faith in the principles. The state of Aupaśamika Samyaktvā is inter-momentary, because after this, the pudgalas of Mithyatva-mohaniya, which were said to manifest after the inter-momentary period during internalization, either manifest or are transformed into kṣayopaśama.

Page #55:
---------------------------
## Second Karma Granth, Chapter 26

The period of initial right faith is called *Upashantaddha*. Before *Upashantaddha*, that is, during the time of the inner consciousness, the soul creates three bundles of secondary situational (arising after *Aupashmik Samyaktv*) false faith from pure karmic results. Just as one part of *Kodravadhan* (a type of rice) becomes so pure after being cleaned of impurities that it does not intoxicate the eater, another part becomes semi-pure, and the third part remains impure, similarly, out of the three bundles of secondary situational false faith, one bundle becomes so pure that it does not contain the power to destroy right faith (*Samyaktvaghatakarasa*). The second bundle becomes semi-pure, and the third bundle remains impure.

When the time of *Aupashmik Samyaktv* is complete, one of these three bundles inevitably arises in the soul according to its karmic results. If the karmic results are pure, the pure bundle arises, and it does not destroy right faith. The right faith that manifests at that time is called *Kshayopaashmik Sasyatva*. If the soul's karmic results are semi-pure, the second bundle arises, and the soul is called *Mishradristi*. If the karmic results are impure, the impure bundle arises, and the soul becomes *Mithyadristi*.

During *Upashantaddha*, which lasts for a moment, the soul is peaceful, tranquil, stable, and full of bliss. When only a small amount of time (one moment) and six *Avalika* (units of time) remain, some souls with *Aupashmik Samyaktv* experience an obstacle in their rising karmic results, meaning their peace is disturbed. At that time, due to the arising of *Anantanu bandhi* passions, the soul abandons the right faith karmic result and leans towards false faith. When...

---------------------------
Karma does not attain Mithyatva (falsehood) immediately. It experiences the taste of enjoyment (Saasvadan) for a period ranging from one Jayanya (instant) to six Aavalikas (a unit of time). During this time, the being is called Saasvadan Samyagdristi (one who has right vision with respect to enjoyment). A being with Aupamika Samyaktva (partial right faith) can be Saasvadan Samyagdristi, but not others.

The statement should be understood in terms of Palyopam and Sagaropama.

One Yojana (a unit of distance) long, one Yojan wide, and one Yojan deep, a well-shaped well, is compared to the time that is measured. This is called Palyopam. Ten Koḍakoḍi Palyopams make one Sagaropama.

The time duration of the Saasvadan Gunasthan (state of being) is from one Jayanya to six Aavalikas.

(3) Misra Gunasthan (mixed state of being) - Its full name is Samyagmithyadristi Gunasthan. But for brevity, it is called Misra Gunasthan.

When the impure, semi-pure, and pure forms of Mithyatvamohaniya (the karmic matter that causes delusion) do not give rise to Anantanu bandhi Kashaya (infinitely binding passions), and the semi-pure Pudgalas (matter) of purity and Mithyatva arise, then when the semi-pure Pudgala arises in the form of impurity, the being's vision becomes partly right (pure) and partly wrong (impure), i.e., mixed. From this, the being is called Samyagmithyadristi (mixed vision) and its state of being is called Samyagmithyadristi Gunasthan (mixed state of being).

In this Gunasthan, there is a weakness in the growth of time, due to which the being neither has a strong liking nor a strong dislike for the principles laid down by the omniscient. But a man born in a coconut island, i.e., an island where coconuts are mainly produced, the inhabitants of that island...

The second karma grantha has never seen or heard of rice and other grains. Therefore, they do not feel any attraction or aversion towards unseen and unheard grains: they remain in a state of non-existence. Similarly, the sambanmithyadristi jiva also remain in a state of equanimity without feeling any attraction or aversion towards the path that is manifested as omniscience.

Just as when curd and jaggery are mixed together in such a way that they cannot be separated again, then each part of it has a mixed form (a combination of both sour and sweet). Similarly, the function of the samyagmithyatva-prakriti, one of the karma-prakritis that destroy the qualities of the soul, is unique. It does not result in only samyaktva-rupa or only mithyatva-rupa, but in a mixed result of both. That is, both samyaktva and mithyatva-rupa results remain at the same time.

_Doubt_ - This cannot become a third gunasthan because a mixed result cannot occur. If two opposite types of results are considered in the same soul and at the same time, then there will be a contradiction in the form of the mutual coexistence of cold and hot. If the two results are considered to arise in sequence, then the mixed form does not become a third gunasthan.

_Solution_ - The above statement is not correct, because according to the mitra-amin nyaya, a friend-like result can occur in the same time and in the same soul. For example, in a person named Devadatta, there can be friendship with Yajnadutta and

**Karma and A-mitra-pana (hostility) are both Dharma (principles) that exist simultaneously and do not contradict each other. Similarly, Shraddha (faith) in the nature of the substance as described by the Sarvagna (omniscient) and Samichinatva (appropriateness) are both Dharma, while Mithyatva (falsehood) and Shraddha in the A-tatva (non-existent) as described by the Sarvagna are both Dharma. These two Dharma can occur in the same time and in the same soul, and there is no contradiction or fault in this.**

**A Jiva (soul) with a mixed Gunasthana (state of qualities) (Samyag-mithyatva-drishti) cannot be bound by the lifespan of the next birth, nor can it die. If this Jiva attains the Sarana (refuge) of the Muga-tha (the fourfold path), it can only die after attaining either Samyaktva (right faith) or Mithyatva (false faith). In other words, if the Jiva has been bound by the lifespan of the next birth during the time of the result of the Samyaktva or Mithyatva, then it will die when that result occurs. In this Gunasthana, there cannot be a Maranantik Samudghat (death-related liberation). Additionally, a Jiva with Samyag-mithyatva-drishti cannot accept Samyama (restraint) (either Sakala Samyama or Ekadesha Samyama).**

**The emergence of the Adha-vishuddha-punja (partially pure bundle) of Mithyatva-mohaniya (falsehood-obscuring) (Samyag-mithyatva-misra) lasts only for an Antarmukhurta (a very short time). After this, either a pure or impure Punja emerges. Therefore, the time duration of the third Gunasthana is only an Antarmukhurta.**

**1. Samma-ichcha-ditti (right intention) does not bind.**

**2. Samudghat is the act of exiting the realms of A-rama (non-physical realms) without leaving the Mula-darira (original body). It has seven types: Vedana (pain), Kavaya (desire), Vaikriya (change), Maranantik (death-related), Tejas (energy), Ahar (food), and Kevala (absolute). The Samudghat that occurs before death is called Maranantik Samudghat.**

(4)  **Avirat Samyagdrishti Gunasthan** refers to the state of abandoning harmful actions like violence, theft, etc., which are the causes of sin. This is called **Virati**.  **Charitra** and **Brat** are also names for **Virati**. A being who, despite having **Samyagdrishti**, cannot refrain from any kind of attachment is called **Avirat Samyagdrishti**, and their specific state is called **Avirat Samyagdrishti Gunasthan**.

The reason for calling this **Gunasthan**-dwelling being **Avirat Samyagdrishti** and for their lack of restraint despite **Samyagdarshan** is the emergence of the **Ekadesha Samyam**-destroying **Apratyaakhyana Avarana Kshaya**.

A **Samyagdrishti** being is a **Kevali** (liberated soul). They have faith in the teachings of the **Upadesht Pravachan**. Due to ignorance, if they also have faith in something that is not true, then upon being explained by the scriptures or by the gurus, they abandon the inappropriate faith and begin to have appropriate faith. If, even after being explained by the guru, acharya, etc., they do not abandon the inappropriate faith, then they are called **Mithyadrishti**.

**Avirat** beings are of seven types:
(1) Those who do not know, accept, or follow the **vrats** (vows) are ordinary people.
(2) Those who do not know or accept the **vrats** but follow them are **Balatapasvi** (those who practice austerities on their own).
(3) Those who do not know the **vrats** but accept them and do not follow them are **Dhole-Pasatthe** (hypocrites) who do not live up to their commitments. 

1. **Hinsanatasteyabrahmaparigrahebhyo Vitritam** - Tattvarth Sutra 1

Page #60:

##  Karma-sava

(4) Agi-tārtha Muni who do not have knowledge of the vows, but accept and follow them.
(5) Those who have knowledge of the vows, but do not accept or follow them. For example, Shrenik, Shri Krishna, etc.
(6) Those who know the vows, do not accept them, but follow them. For example, the Anuttara Vimānavāsī Devas.
(7) Those who know the vows, accept them, but do not follow them later. For example, the Samvigna Pākshika.

Vows are successful only with Samyak Jnana (right knowledge), Samyak Grahan (right acceptance), and Samyak Palan (right observance). Those who do not have Samyak Jnana of the vows, do not accept the vows according to the rules, and do not observe the vows in reality, even if they follow the vows according to the Ghunaakshar Nyaya, they cannot attain the fruits of the vows.

Out of the seven types of Avirat mentioned above, the first four types of Avirat beings do not have knowledge of the vows, so they are Mithyavrushti. Because they cannot accept and follow the vows according to the rules, but they consider them to be real.

Among the Avirat Samyagdristi beings, some are Aupashmika Samyaktvi, some are Kshayopa-samyaktvi, and some are Kshayik Samyaktvi.

In this Ganasthan, birth, death, lifespan, and future life occur.

(5) Deshavirat Gunasthan - Due to the rise of Pratyakhyanavaran Kshaya, the beings who are not completely free from sinful actions, but can be separated from sinful actions by the Desha (part) due to the non-rise of Pratyakhyanavaran Kshaya, are called Deshavirat.

Page #61:
---------------------------
##  The Second Karma Granth: Deshavira

Deshavira is also called a Shravak. Their nature is the special Deshavira Gunasthan. 

A being residing in this Gunasthan has faith in the words of the omniscient, the Vitarag, and refrains from violence with tolerance. However, they do not refrain from harming stationary beings without purpose. This means that they are called Vira-Avira because they are Vira (refraining) from violence towards sentient beings but not Vira (refraining) from violence towards stationary beings.

Many Shravaks residing in this Gunasthan take one vow, some take two, and some take three, four, five, up to twelve vows. They also adopt the eleven images of a Shravak and work for the welfare of the soul. There are also Shravaks who follow the maximum number of vows and do not participate in any other way in sinful actions except with permission.

There are three types of permission: (1) Pratimayanu-mati, (2) Prati-shravananu-mati, (3) Samvasanu-mati. Using food, etc., prepared by oneself or another is Pratimayanu-mati. Hearing about the sinful actions done by a relative like a son, etc., and not stopping them from doing those actions even after hearing about them is Prati-shravananu-mati. Having affection for a son, etc., when they are involved in sinful activities, meaning not hearing about the sinful activities and not praising them even after hearing about them is Samvasanu-mati. The Shravak who does not participate in any way in the beginnings of sinful actions, only accepts Samvasanu-mati, is superior to all other Shravaks.

The Deshavira Gunasthan is only found in humans and Tiryanch beings.

Page #62:
---------------------------
**Karmastava**

- The four Gunasthanas (states of being) at the beginning are applicable to all beings in the four gatis (states of existence): Deva (gods), Manushya (humans), Tiryanch (animals), and Narak (hell beings).
The duration of this Gunasthan is from the shortest Antarmuhurt (a fraction of a moment) to the longest Deshonapurva Koti (a vast period of time).

(6) **Pramattasanyata Gunasthan** - Those beings who are completely free from sinful activities through proper conduct are called Sanyatas (ascetics). However, as long as they indulge in Pramada (negligence), they are called Pramattasanyatas, and their specific nature is called Pramattasanyata Gunasthan. Beings in this Gunasthan abstain from even the slightest of careless actions, to the extent that they do not even indulge in the aforementioned Mambasanumati (indulgence in the five senses). _Although the complete absence of Pratyakhyanavaran Kshaya (the covering of the soul that prevents complete restraint) leads to complete restraint in this Gunasthan, the presence of Pramada, which generates impurities in restraint due to the arising of Sanjwalan (passion) and other Kshayas (passions), is why it is called Pramattasanyata.

There are fifteen types of Pramada:
- Four Vikatha (stories of women, devotees, kings, and thieves).
- Four Kshayas (anger, pride, deceit, and greed).
- Five attachments to the objects of the senses (touch, taste, breath, sight, and hearing).
- Sleep and affection.

In this Gunasthan, the purity of qualities is more prominent than the renunciation of the world.

## Second Karma-Prakarana

And in comparison to the Aprammat-Samyat, the pure-quality deteriorates. In this quality-state, the fourteen pre-existing Muni use the Ahar-Kalabdhi.

The state of the Prammat-Samyat quality-state is inferior to one-time and superior to a little less than a crore of pre-existences, and this and the subsequent quality-states are only for the beings of the human realm.

(7) Aprammat-Samyat Quality-State - Those who are restrained (Muni) and do not have Vikatha, Kshaya, etc. distractions, are Aprammat-Samyat, and their specific nature, which occurs in the extreme state of purity and impurity of the qualities like knowledge, etc., is called the Aprammat-Samyat quality-state. That is, the restrained (Muni) who have a mild rise of Sanjwalan and Nok-Kshaya, and whose explicit and implicit distractions are destroyed, and who are immersed in knowledge, meditation, and penance, with a pure mind, are called Aprammat-Samyat.

Due to the connection with distraction, the soul's purity of qualities deteriorates. Therefore, from this quality-state onwards, all the present Muni remain Aprammat in their nature.

The only difference between the sixth Prammat-Samyat quality-state and the seventh Aprammat-Samyat quality-state is that in the seventh quality-state, there is not even a slight distraction, therefore, transgression, etc. in the vows is not possible, but the sixth quality-state, being prone to distraction, has the possibility of transgression in the vows. These two quality-states are unstable like the needle of a motion-indicating instrument. Meaning, sometimes the seventh becomes the sixth, and sometimes the sixth becomes the seventh quality-state, respectively.

Karma, having reached the eighth *guna-sthana*, either takes on the *upshama* or *kshapika* category or returns to the sixth *guna-sthana*.

**(8) Nivritti-badar Guna-sthana** This is also called *Apuvrakaran Guna-sthana*. *Adhyavasaya*, *Parinam*, *Nivritti* - these three are synonymous terms, in which the *aprammatta* soul's *ananta-bandhi*, *apratyakhyana-avaran* and *pratyakhyana-avaran* - these three *chauk* shaped *badar* *kashya* are eliminated, that state is called *Nivritti-badar Guna-sthana*.

The sixth and seventh *guna-sthana* exist within a moment. But the *san-yata* (monk) who attains a special type of purity by touching the sixth and seventh *guna-sthana* and is about to establish the *upshama* or *kshapika* category, comes to the *guna-sthana* called *Apuvrakaran*.

Although the beginning of both categories is from the ninth *guna-sthana*, their foundation is laid in this *guna-sthana*. The eighth *guna-sthana* is for laying the foundation of both types of categories, and the categories begin in the ninth *guna-sthana*. That is, in the eighth *guna-sthana*, there is only the potential for *upshama* or *kshapana*.

At the time of the eighth *guna-sthana*, the being establishes these five things:

(1) *Sthiti-ghat*, (2) *Rasa-dhal*, (3) *Gunani*, (4) *Gun-san-kraman* and (5) *Apuv-sthiti-bandh*.

(1) *Sthiti-ghat* - Reducing the large state of karma by *apvartanakaran*, that is, removing the karmic particles that are about to arise in the future from their fixed times of arising by *apvartanakaran*, is called *Sthiti-ghat*.

(2) *Rasa-ghat* - Reducing the intense power of the bound *shana-avaran* etc. karmas to bear fruit by *apvartanakaran* is called *Rasa-ghat*.

## Second Karma Granth

**(3)** The process of **guna-dheno** is the destruction of the **karma-dalikas** of the Jinas, meaning that the **karma-dalikas** are removed from their designated times of arising and are established in the **ant-muhurt** in accordance with the order of time.

The order of establishment is as follows:

From the time of arising to the **ant-muhurt**, excluding the times of the **udaya-abalikas**, the **dalikas** established in the first time period are few. In the second time period, the **dalikas** established are countless times more than those established in the first time period. In this way, until the final time period of the **ant-muhurt**, the **dalikas** established in each subsequent time period should be understood to be countless times more than those established in the previous time periods.

**(4)** **Guna-samkramana**... is the transfer of previously bound **ashubha-prakritis** to the **shubha-prakritis** being bound in the present, meaning that the previously bound **ashubha-prakritis** are transformed into the **shubha-prakritis** being bound in the present.

The order of **guna-samkramana** is briefly as follows:

In the first time period, the number of **dalikas** of **ashubha-prakritis** that undergo **samkramana** into **shubha-prakritis** is countless times less than the number that undergo **samkramana** in the second time period, which is countless times less than the number in the third time period. In this way, as long as **guna-samkramana** continues, the number of **dalikas** that undergo **samkramana** in each subsequent time period is countless times more than those that underwent **samkramana** in the previous time periods.

## Firmstava (5) Apurva Sthitibandha

Apurva Sthitibandha is the binding of karmas with extremely minimal presence, compared to before.

Although Sthitighāt, etc., these five things also occur in the previous Gunasthanas, they are unique in the eighth Gunasthāna. Because the purity of the Adhyavāsayas in the previous Gunasthanas is less than their increase in the eighth Gunasthāna. In the previous Gunasthanas, there is very little presence and very little Rasaghāt, but in the eighth Gunasthāna, there is more presence and more Rasaghāt. Similarly, in the previous Gunasthanas, the time limit of the Gunashreni is more, and the Dalikas whose Gunashreni (creation or establishment) is done are less, and in the eighth Gunasthāna, there are many more Dalikas eligible for Gunashreni, but the time limit is very less. Compared to the previous Gunasthanas, there is a lot of Gunasamkraman of karmas. Therefore, it is unique, and in the eighth Gunasthāna, karmas with such minimal presence are bound, which are never bound in the previous Gunasthanas with such minimal presence.

Thus, due to the unique arrangement of Sthitighāt, etc., in this Gunasthāna, this Gunasthāna is called Apurvakarana.

In this eighth Gunasthāna, the unique Yogirupa state of the soul begins. That is, to produce the unique fruit of Aupashmika or Kshayika Bhavarupa, it is necessary to subdue or destroy the Charitramōhaniyakarma, and to do that, three Karana have to be done, namely Yathapravrittikarana, Apurvakarana, and Anivrittikarana. Among them, the seventh Gunasthāna is Yathapravrittikarana, the eighth Gunasthāna is Apurvakarana, and the ninth Gunasthāna is Anivrittikarana.

## Second Karma Granth

Those beings who have attained, are attaining, and will attain the A-puurva-karana Guna-sthana, the number of their Adhyavasaya-sthana (Parinaama-bheda) is equal to the countless regions of the Lokakasha. Because the state of this Guna-sthana is Antarmukhurta proof, and there are countless Antarmukhurta. Of these, only the first time-bound beings of the three times, their Adhyavasaya is also equal to the countless regions of the Lokakasha. In the same way, the Adhyavasaya of the second, third, and other time-bound beings are also equal to the countless regions of the Lokakasha in calculation.

There are countless types of countless numbers. Therefore, the number of Adhyavasaya of each time-bound being and the number of Adhyavasaya of all time-bound beings present in all times - both these numbers are generally the same, i.e., countless, yet these two countless numbers are different from each other.

In this eighth Guna-sthana, each time-bound tri-kaalik being is infinite and their Adhyavasaya is countless. The reason for this is that although the Adhyavasaya of many beings of the same time-bound are separate from each other (with less or more purity), yet the Adhyavasaya of many beings of the same time-bound are considered to be of equal purity and are not considered separate. Of the countless Adhyavasaya of each time, those Adhyavasaya which are of less purity are called Jghana and those Adhyavasaya which are of more purity than all other Adhyavasaya are called Utkrishta.

Thus, there is one class of Jghana Adhyavasaya and another class of Utkrishta Adhyavasaya. Between these two classes, there are countless...

Page #68:
---------------------------
There are 32 **karma** categories, all of which have **adhya-vayas** (karmic tendencies) that are considered **madhyama** (intermediate). The purification of the **jghanya** (inferior) **adhya-vayas** of the first category is less difficult than the purification of the **utkrista** (superior) **adhya-vayas** of the last category. And within the 32 categories, the **adhya-vayas** of the later categories are considered to be more pure than the **adhya-vayas** of the earlier categories.

Generally, one should understand that **adhya-vayas** of the same time period are more pure than each other in the following ways:

(1) **Ananta-bhag** (infinite parts) more pure,
(2) **Asankhyata-bhag** (innumerable parts) more pure,
(3) **Sankhyata-bhag** (countable parts) more pure,
(4) **Sankhyata-guna** (countable times) more pure,
(5) **Asankhyata-guna** (innumerable times) more pure,
(6) **Ananta-guna** (infinite times) more pure.

These six types of greater purity, **Ananta-bhag** more pure, etc., are called **pad-sthana** (stages).

Thus, in the order of purification, the **adhya-vayas** of the second time period are different from the **adhya-vayas** of the first time period. And the **utkrista** **adhya-vayas** of the first time period are **Ananta-guna** (infinite times) more pure than the **jghanya** **adhya-vayas** of the first time period. And the **jghanya** **adhya-vayas** of the second time period are also **Ananta-guna** (infinite times) more pure than the **utkrista** **adhya-vayas** of the first time period. In this way, until the final time period, the **adhya-vayas** of each subsequent time period are more pure than the **adhya-vayas** of the previous time periods.

The names of these **pad-sthana** (stages) are:

(1) **Ananta-bhag** **hina** (infinite parts less),
(2) **Asankhyata-bhag** **hina** (innumerable parts less),
(3) **Sankhyata-bhag** **hina** (countable parts less),
(4) **Sankhyata-guna** **hina** (countable times less),
(5) **Asankhyata-guna** **hina** (innumerable times less),
(6) **Ananta-guna** **hina** (infinite times less).

## Second Karma Granth, Chapter 33

The inferior *adhyavasaya* of each and every time should be understood as infinitely pure compared to the superior *adhyavasaya* of that time, and the inferior *adhyavasaya* of later times should be understood as infinitely pure compared to the superior *adhyavasaya* of earlier times.

The time of the eighth *gunasthan* is an example of an inferior time and the final moment is an example of a superior time.

**(6) Abhivritti Gunasthan:** Its full name is *Anivritti-Vadasamparaya Gatasthan*. In this *gunasthan*, *haar* (gross) *ray* (passion) arises, and because the results of the *jivas* who are contemporaneous are the same but not different, this *gunasthan* is called *Anivritti-Chadar-Samparaya Gunasthan*.

This *gunasthan* is an example of an inferior and superior state, and the final moment. There are as many *adhyavasaya* states in this *gunasthan* as there are moments in the final moment. Because the *jivas* who are contemporaneous in the ninth *gunasthan* all have the same *adhyavasaya*, i.e., they are of equal purity. Similarly, until the final moment of the ninth *gunasthan*, the *adhyavasaya* of the *jivas* present in the second, third, etc., equivalent times are the same, and there is only one *adhyavasaya* state for the same *adhyavasaya*. That is, there are as many results as there is time in this *gunasthan*. Therefore, there is only one result in each time. Therefore, here there is complete dissimilarity in the results of different contemporaneous *jivas* and complete similarity in the results of the same contemporaneous *jivas*, and the karmas are destroyed by these results.

**1.  "He does not drink, and the results are destroyed by him. ||56||  He becomes non-attached, and he attains the state of liberation, as there is only one result. ||57||  He becomes pure and wise, and he knows the nature of karma." ||57||  Gommatasar, Jivakand 56-57**

Page #70:
---------------------------
## 34

This is now explained in detail:

There can be as many categories of **karma** **adhyaavasayas** as there are times in a **guna-sthana**. Each category may include an infinite number of **adhyaavasayas** of infinite **trikaalik** beings. However, since all **adhyaavasayas** in each category are equal in purity, the **adhyaavasaya-sthana** of each category is the same. But the **adhyaavasaya-sthana** of the first time - the **adhyaavasayas** of the first category - are infinitely purer than the **adhyaavasaya-sthana** of the second time - the **adhyaavasayas** of the second category. Similarly, the **adhyaavasaya-sthana** of the second, third, fourth, etc., up to the ninth **guna-sthana** at the final time, should be understood as infinitely purer than the **adhyaavasaya-sthana** of the previous times.

Although there is purity in the **adhyaavasayas** of the eighth and ninth **guna-sthana**, they have their own unique characteristics. For example, in the eighth **guna-sthana**, the **adhyaavasayas** of the infinite **trikaalik** beings who are contemporary can be divided into countless categories due to the rapid rate of purification, but in the ninth **guna-sthana**, there is only one category due to the equal purity of the **adhyaavasayas** of the infinite **kaalik** beings who are contemporary. Compared to the previous **guna-sthana**, the proportion of **kṣaya** decreases in the subsequent **guna-sthana**, and the purity of the results of the being increases according to the decrease in **kṣaya**. The purity in the ninth **guna-sthana** is so much higher than in the eighth **guna-sthana** that the differences in its **adhyaavasayas** are much less than the differences in the **adhyaavasayas** of the eighth **guna-sthana**.

Beings who attain the ninth **guna-sthana** are of two types: (1) **upshamka** and (2) **kṣapka**. Those who are...

Page #71:
---------------------------
## Second Karma Granth
### 35

Those who subdue the karmas are called *upashamak* (subduers), and those who destroy the *charitramohaniya* karma are called *kshapik* (destroyers). While subduing or destroying the *mohaniya* karma, they also subdue or destroy many other karmas.

**(10) Sukshma Samparaya Gunasthan:** This *gunasthan* is known as "Sukshma Samparaya Gunasthan" because only the subtle fragments of *samparaya* (greed-based *kṣaya*) arise in it. Just as a faint redness remains in a cloth dyed pink, similarly, the *jiva* in this *gunasthan* experiences the subtle fragments of *samparaya*.

The *jiva* in this *gunasthan* is also either an *upashamak* or a *kshapik*. Except for greed, there is no other nature of *charitramohaniya* karma that has not been subdued or destroyed. Therefore, those who are *upashamak* only subdue the greed-based *kṣaya*, and those who are *kshapik* destroy it.

Whether the one who experiences subtle greed ascends to the *upashama* or *kshapika* category, they remain slightly less than *yathakyatacharitra*. This means that the emergence of subtle greed slightly hinders the manifestation of *yathakyatacharitra*.

The time duration of this *gunasthan* is from the shortest moment to the longest *antarmuhurt*.

**(11) Upashanta-Kṣaya-Shetaraga Chhadmastra Gunasthan:** Those whose *kṣayas* are subdued, who do not experience any *raga* at all, and who have *chhadma* (covering, deadly karmas) attached to them, are *upashanta-kṣaya-vitaraga* (subdued-kṣaya-free from *raga*)...

Page #72:
---------------------------
The **Kamasthava** are those whose nature is characterized by **Upshant Kshaya-Vitrag-Chhadmasth Gunasthan**.

They are like the water of a lake in the autumn season, which becomes clear and pure due to the subsidence of the **Mohaniya Karma**. This means that the **Mohaniya Karma** still exists but does not manifest.

The term "**Upshant-Kshaya-Vitrag-Chhadmasth Gunasthan**" has three adjectives: (1) **Upshant-Kshaya**, (2) **Vitrag**, and (3) **Chhadmasth**. Of these, "**Chhadmasth**" is a **Swaroop-Visheshana** (adjective that describes the nature of the noun). This is because even without it, the term "**Upshant-Kshaya-Vitrag Gunasthan**" would still refer to the eleventh **Gunasthan**, and no other meaning would be understood. Therefore, "**Chhadmasth**" is an adjective that clarifies the nature of its noun.

"**Upshant-Kshaya**" and "**Vitrag**" are **Byavartka-Visheshana** (adjectives that distinguish the noun from others). Only with the presence of both these adjectives can the intended meaning be understood. Without them, other meanings besides the intended one can also be understood. For example, without the adjective "**Upshant-Kshaya**", the term "**Vitrag-Chhadmasth Gunasthan**" would refer to the twelfth **Gunasthan** as well, in addition to the intended meaning (the eleventh **Gunasthan**). This is because the twelfth...

Page #73:
---------------------------
In the second Karmagrantha Gunasthan, the Jiva also experiences Chhadma (knowledge-obscuring karmas like Dhatikarma) and Vitragatva (absence of the arising of raga), but the epithet Upshantakashaya cannot indicate the twelfth Gunasthan. Because in the twelfth Gunasthan, the Jiva's kshayas are not Upshanta (subdued), but rather they are destroyed. Similarly, in the absence of the epithet 'Vitrag', the Upshanta-Kashaya-Chhadmastha Gunasthan, by that very name, can also indicate the fourth, fifth, etc. Gunasthanas, because the Jiva's Anantanu bandhi kshayas can be Upshanta in the fourth, fifth, etc. Gunasthanas. But with the presence of the epithet 'Vitrag', the fourth, fifth, etc. Gunasthanas cannot be indicated. Because in those Gunasthanas, the present Jiva has the inherent nature of the arising of raga (maya and lobha), therefore Vitragatva is impossible.

The Jiva existing in the eleventh Gunasthan is not capable of attaining the further Gunasthanas; because one can only attain the further Gunasthanas by performing Kshapakathanni, and without Kshapakshreni, Moksha cannot be attained. But the Jiva of the eleventh Gunasthan, by rule, is only capable of performing Upshamshreni. Therefore, that Jiva inevitably falls from the eleventh Gunasthan.

When the time of this Gunasthan is not complete, and the Jiva falls due to the destruction of bhava (life), then it is born in the Anuttar Vimana in the form of a deva, and at that time, since the fifth, etc. Gunasthanas are not possible in that place, it attains the fourth (Aviratsamyagdristi) Gunasthan, and upon attaining the fourth Gunasthan, that Jiva begins to experience the bandha, udaya, and udirana of all those karma-prakritis, as many karma-prakritis are capable of bandha, udaya, and udirana.

Page #74:
---------------------------
You have the knowledge. But when a being falls from the Ganasthan, while still in the Ay, after the time of the Ganasthan is complete, it attains the Gunasthanas in the order of ascent during the fall, and begins to bind, arise, and stir up the karmic natures appropriate to that Gunasthan. That is, just as during the ascent, it attains each Gunasthan in the order of ascent, and breaks the binding, arising, and stirring up of the karmic natures, in the same way, during the fall, the being attains each Gunasthan and begins to bind, arise, and stir up those karmic natures. And the time of the Gunasthan ends. A being falling from the sixth Gunasthan may fall to the fifth, the fourth, or even the second Gunasthan.

The order of the beginning of the Upshamshreni is as follows:

A being present in any of the fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh Gunasthan first pacifies the four Kapas, namely, anger, etc., which are Anantanubandhi. Then, in the next moment, it pacifies the Darshanmohaniya Trika (Samyaktva, Samyaktva-Mithyatva, Mithyatva) together.

According to the Karmagranthakarta, the Upshamshreni cannot be done more than twice in one birth, and the Kshapakshreni is done only once. One who has done the Upshamshreni once can become Kshapaki and attain liberation in that birth. But one who has done the Upshamshreni twice cannot do the Kshapakshreni in the same birth. However, the Siddhanta's opinion is that a being can do the Shreni only once in a birth. Therefore, one who has done the Upshamshreni once cannot do the Kshapakshreni again in the same birth.

Page #75:
---------------------------
## Second Karma Granth

After that, the soul repeatedly comes and goes in the sixth and seventh Gunasthanas. Later, after attaining the eighth Gunasthana, it reaches the ninth Gunasthana and begins the suppression of the remaining types of Charitramohaniya Karma. This suppression occurs in the following order: first, the suppression of Napumsakaved, followed by Strived, Hasyaadishatk (laughter, attraction, aversion, sorrow, fear, and disgust), Purushaved, Apratyakhyanavaran, Pratyakhyanavaran Krodhayugal, Sanjwalan Krodh, Apratyakhyanavaran, Pratyakhyanavaran Mayayugal, Sanjwalan Maya, Apratyakhyanavaran, Pratyakhyanavaran Lobhayugal, and finally, the suppression of Sanjwalan Lobh in the tenth Gunasthana.

The time limit for the eleventh Gunasthana is a minimum of one moment and a maximum of an Antarmuhurta.

**(12) Ksheen-Kshaya-Vitrag Chadmasth Gunasthana:** This Gunasthana is attained only after the complete destruction of Mohaniya Karma. The emotions of the soul residing in this Gunasthana are as pure as water kept in a clear crystal vessel. This is because Mohaniya Karma is completely destroyed here, and its existence ceases to be.

Those who have completely destroyed Mohaniya Karma but still have the remaining Chadma (covering of Ghatikarma) are called Ksheen-Kshaya-Vitrag Chadmasth, and their specific nature is called Ksheen-Kshaya-Vitrag Chadmasth Gunasthana.

In the name of this twelfth Gunasthana, there are three specific differentiators: (1) Ksheen-Kshaya, (2) Vitrag, and (3) Chadmasth. Because without the differentiator "Ksheen-Kshaya," the name "Vitrag Chadmasth" would also refer to the eleventh Gunasthana. By adding the differentiator "Ksheen-Kshaya," it specifically refers to the twelfth Gunasthana.

Page #76:
---------------------------
This refers to the **Hari Na** (Hari-Na) state. Because in the eleventh **Gunasthan** (Gunasthan), the **Kshaya** (Kshaya) are not completely destroyed, but only subdued. The term "**Veetrag**" (Veetrag) is absent, and the **Ksheen-Kshaya-Chhadmasya** (Ksheen-Kshaya-Chhadmasya) Gunasthan is also referred to by this name, besides the twelfth Gunasthan. Because in those Gunasthan, the **Ananta-Anubandhi** (Ananta-Anubandhi) and other Kshaya can be destroyed. But due to the presence of the term "Veetrag", the fourth and other Gunasthan are not referred to. Because in some way, **Rag** (Rag) arises in those Gunasthan, making **Veetragatva** (Veetragatva) impossible. Similarly, the absence of the term "**Chhadmasth**" (Chhadmasth) also makes the term "Ksheen-Kshaya-Veetrag" refer to the thirteenth and fourteenth Gunasthan, besides the twelfth Gunasthan. But due to the presence of the term "Chhadmasth", only the twelfth Gunasthan is referred to. Because the **Jiva** (Jiva) residing in the thirteenth and fourteenth Gunasthan do not have **Chhadma** (Chhadma) (the covering of **Ghatikarma** (Ghatikarma)).

Thus, by saying "**Ksheen-Kshaya-Veetrag-Chhadmasth**" (Ksheen-Kshaya-Veetrag-Chhadmasth), the true state of the twelfth Gunasthan is known, and the related other doubts are resolved.

To attain the twelfth Gunasthan, the destruction of **Mohaniya-Karma** (Mohaniya-Karma) is necessary, and to destroy it, the **Kshapaka-Shreni** (Kshapaka-Shreni) is performed. Therefore, here we briefly explain the order of the Kshapaka-Shreni.

The Jiva performing the Kshapaka-Shreni, first destroys the **Ananta-Anubandhi-Kshaya-Chatushk** (Ananta-Anubandhi-Kshaya-Chatushk) and **Darshan-Moh-Trika** (Darshan-Moh-Trika), seven in total, in any Gunasthan from the fourth to the seventh.

1. **Ananta-Anubandhi** **Krodh** (Krodh), **Ananta-Anubandhi** **Man** (Man), **Ananta-Anubandhi** **Maya** (Maya), **Ananta-Anubandhi** **Lobh** (Lobh).
2. Three forms of **Darshan-Mohaniya** (Darshan-Mohaniya): **Samyak-Tva-Mohaniya** (Samyak-Tva-Mohaniya), **Samyak-Tva-Mithyatva-Mohaniya** (Samyak-Tva-Mithyatva-Mohaniya) (**Minn-Mohaniya** (Minn-Mohaniya)), **Mithyatva-Mohaniya** (Mithyatva-Mohaniya).

---------------------------
## Second Firm Granth

The eighth Gunasthan begins with the destruction of the four A-pratyakhyana Avarana Kshayas and the four Pratyakhyana Avarana Kshayas. These eight natures do not completely perish, but in the beginning of the ninth Gunasthan, the destruction of the sixteen natures of Styanaddhitrik Narakdwik, Tiyan Dwik, Jati Chatushk, and Atap, Udyot, Stavar, Sukshma, and Sadharan takes place. After this, the remaining part of the A-pratyakhyana Avarana Chatushk and Pratyakhyana Avarana Chatushk is destroyed. At the end of the ninth Gunasthan, the destruction of Napunsakaved, Strived, Hasyaadishatk, Purushaved, Sanjwalan Krodh, Man, and Maya takes place in order. Finally, in the tenth Gunasthan, Sanjwalan Lobh is also destroyed. In this way, upon the destruction of all Mohaniya Karma, the attainment of the twelfth Gunasthan occurs.

The twelfth Gunasthan is the proof of the Jghanya and Utkrishta Kalasthiti Antarmuhurt. In this Gunasthan, the present Jiva is only of the Kshapaka श्रेणी.

Those who do not expect anything from karma and are endowed with yoga (self-power, strength, enthusiasm, valor) are called **Sayogikevali**, and their specific nature is called **Sayogikevali Gunasthan**.  **Sayogikevali** are also called **Jin**, **Jinendra**, **Jineswar** because they are free from destructive karmas.

The tendency of yoga arises from these three instruments: mind, speech, and body. Therefore, there are three types of yoga according to their instruments: (1) **Manoyoga**, (2) **Vachanayoga**, (3) **Kayayoga**.  **Kevali Bhagwan** uses **Manoyoga** to answer someone mentally. When a **Manaparyayajnani** or **Anuttar Vibhagavasi** deva asks a question mentally without using words, **Kevali** answers them mentally. The questioner, being a **Manaparyayajnani** or **Anuttar Vibhagavasi** deva, directly perceives the mental substances organized by **Kevali Bhagwan** to answer through their **Manaparyayajnan** or **Avadhijnan**. Based on the structure of these mental substances, they infer the answer to their question. **Kevali Bhagwan** uses **Vachanayoga** to give teachings and **Kayayoga** for actions like movement.

If a **Sayogikevali** is a **Tirthankara**, they establish a **Tirth** and propagate it by giving teachings.

The duration of this **Gunasthan** is from **Jghan** to **Antarmuhurt** and the highest is slightly less than crores of years in the past.

They remain in the state of Manibhava.  The state and pudgala of the second karma granthi.

43 (14) Ayogikevali Gunasthan - Those who are devoid of the yogas of the Kevali Bhagavan are called Ayogikevali, that is, when the Sayogikevali, by suppressing the yogas of mind, speech and body, become devoid of yoga and attain the pure self-nature, then they are called Ayogikevali and their special nature is called Ayogikevali Gunasthan.  _ In this Gunasthan, the process of attaining liberation begins, that is, this Gunasthan is the gateway to liberation.  The suppression of all three yogas leads to the state of Ayoni.  Only the Bhagavan remain in the Sogibhava state according to their lifespan.  But those Kevali Bhagavan whose state and pudgala atoms (regions) of the three karmas of Vedaniya, Nama and Gotra are more than the state and pudgala atoms of Ayukarma among the four fatal karmas, they perform 'Samudghat' and by this they make the state and pudgala atoms of Vedaniya, Nama and Gotra karma equal to the state and pudgala atoms of Ayukarma.  1, This Samudghat performed by the Kevali Bhagavan is called 'Kanvalisamudghat'.

Eight times are taken in this Samudghat.  In the first time, the Kevali's Atma-pradesh becomes the size of a Danda.  This Danda is as thick as his body and as long as fourteen Raju, extending to the Lok.  In the second time, this Danda spreads to the East-West or North-South Lok and takes the form of a Kapata.  In the third time, that Kapata gets stuck in the East-South or West-North and becomes the Madhani's Nuly.  By this, most of the Lok is filled with the Kevali's Atma-pradesh, yet due to the Madhani's shape, some intervals of the sky remain empty, therefore in the fourth time, by Pratarasthiti, the Kevali's Atma-pradesh reaches all those empty sky regions.  At that time, the entire...

Although the complete destruction of the four fatal karmas, namely mohaniya, etc., leads to the manifestation of liberation (vitragatva) and omniscience (sarvagnatva), the four non-fatal karmas, namely vedaniya, etc., still remain. This prevents liberation. Therefore, the destruction of these remaining karmas is also essential. When these karmas are also destroyed, the cycle of birth and death ceases due to the complete absence of karmas, and this is liberation.

However, if the intensity of the ayu karma is less and the intensity of the remaining three non-fatal karmas - vedaniya, nama, and gotra - is more, then their destruction along with ayu karma is not possible. Therefore, the destruction of these karmas occurs along with the destruction of the intensity of ayu karma, etc.

The soul-regions (atma-pradesh) of the Kevali extend to every region of the universe (loka-akasha), and their aura (asma) pervades the entire universe. This is because the countless regions of a soul and the countless regions of the universe are equal.

After this process, the soul-regions begin to contract. For example, in the fifth time interval, the regions become empty and transform into a churning vessel (mathani), in the sixth time interval, they become a door (kapat), in the seventh time interval, they become a staff (danda), and in the eighth time interval, the soul of the Kevali Bhagwan returns to its original form.

This process of soul-expansion (samuddhāt) is natural. It takes only eight time intervals. Through this process of soul-expansion, the non-fatal karmas with intensity greater than the intensity of ayu karma are destroyed. Then, the Kevali attains liberation within a moment (antar-muhūrta).

In this process of soul-expansion, there is no activity of the mind (man) and speech (vachan) yogas, only the body yoga (kāya-yoga) is active. Even in that, in the first, eighth time intervals, there is generous body yoga (audārika kāya-yoga), in the second, sixth, and seventh time intervals, there is mixed generous body yoga (audārika-miśra kāya-yoga), and in the third, fourth, and fifth time intervals, there is karmic body yoga (kārmaṇ kāya-yoga).

The soul-expansion (samuddhāt) occurs only for ordinary Kevalis, not for the Tirthankaras.

It is inevitable for a Kevali Bhagwan to be subjected to Samudghāt. However, those Kevali Jñānīs whose Vedaniya, etc., three types of Aghati Karmas are equal to the Āyu Karma of the Pudgala Paramanu, do not experience Samudghāt.

All Kevali Jñānīs, at the end of their Sayogi state, due to the cause of Paramanirjarā and being devoid of Leśyā, restrain their Yogas for the sake of attaining the extremely stable state of meditation. The order of Yoga Nirodha is as follows:

Firstly, they restrain Bādar Mano Yoga and Bādar Vachan Yoga from Bādar (gross) Kāya Yoga. Subsequently, they restrain that Bādar Kāya Yoga from Sūkṣma Kāya Yoga. And from that same Sūkṣma Kāya Yoga, they restrain Sūkṣma Mano Yoga and Sūkṣma Vachan Yoga in a sequential manner. Finally, with the power of Sūkṣma Kriyā Nivṛtti Śukla Dhyān, the Kevali Bhagwan also restrains Sūkṣma Kāya Yoga. In this way, upon the restraint of Yogas, the Sayogi Kevali Bhagwan becomes Ayogi. Simultaneously, with the help of the same Sūkṣma Kriyā Nivṛtti Śukla Dhyān, they fill the inner parts of their body - mouth, abdomen, etc. - with the Ātma Pradesh.

Their Ātma Pradesh become so contracted and dense that they fit within two-thirds (2/3) of the body. After this, those Kevali Bhagwan attain Samuccinna Kriyā Apratipāti Śukla Dhyān.

1. At the end of the order of Yoga Nirodha, the Sarvajna Bhagwan restrain the remaining Yogas from Sūkṣma Kāya Yoga. This is then called Sūkṣma Kriyā Nivṛtti Śukla Dhyān. Because in this, only the subtle actions like inhalation and exhalation remain, and even the shedding and transformation from them is not possible.

2. In this Dhyān, even the subtle actions like breathing, etc., cease in the body, and the Ātma Pradesh become completely still. Because in this...

and the time taken to pronounce five short vowels (a, i, u, ṛ, ḷṛ) is the time taken for **shaileshikaran** (destruction of name, lineage and lifespan), all karmas are completely destroyed. When those karmas are destroyed, they move upwards to the Siddha Kshetra in a single moment of righteous conduct.

Just as a clay pot, covered in clay, rises upwards from the water level due to its nature when the clay is removed and becomes stable on the surface of the water, similarly, when the karma-mala is removed, the pure soul, due to its nature of upward movement, moves upwards to the front part of the upper realm and resides there.

The reason for the pure soul residing in the front part of the realm is that there is no supporting cause, **dharmaastikaya**, for further movement beyond the end of the realm. Therefore, liberated beings only move up to the end of the upper realm.

There is no mental, verbal or physical activity of any kind, gross or subtle, and that state does not change later. Due to the effect of this meditation, all attachment and bondage are stopped, all karmas are destroyed, and liberation is attained.

This is about the Supreme Being, the Siddha Bhagavan, who resides at the forefront of the universe. They are free from the veils of knowledge (Jnana Avarana) and other substances, as well as from the passions (Bhavas). They experience the infinite bliss of nectar, along with peace. They are free from the defilement of false perception (Mithyadarshana) and other causes of new karma-binding. They possess eight qualities: knowledge, perception, bliss, energy, non-obstruction, penetration, subtlety, and lightness. They are eternal and have no further actions to perform.

Karma-binding causes the soul to wander in the cycle of birth and death. The complete destruction of karma-binding, which is achieved through the absence and exhaustion of its causes, is liberation (Moksha).  

The cycle of binding new karma and exhausting past karma continues for worldly beings, preventing them from attaining their true nature. However, as karma is exhausted, the causes of karma-binding also diminish, leading the soul towards self-realization. Eventually, they attain their true nature, which includes infinite knowledge, perception, and other qualities.

The exhaustion of karma begins with the attainment of right conduct (Samyaktava) and culminates in the state of omniscience (Sarvjna). This process gradually purifies the results of karma, leading to greater purity with each stage. The greater the purity of the results, the less karma needs to be exhausted. This means that the amount of karma exhausted in each stage is less than the previous stage.

The universe is divided into two parts: Lok and Alok. Lok is the realm where there are living beings and other objects, while Alok is the realm where there is only space (Akasha) and no other objects. This difference is due to the presence of the Dharma-Astikaya in Lok. It is not present in Alok. If the Dharma-Astikaya and other substances were present outside Lok, the distinction between Lok-Akasha and Alok-Akasha would cease to exist.

**Karma-Nirjara**

As the purity of the results in future states increases, the Karma-Nirjara increases innumerably. Thus, it gradually increases and finally reaches its peak in the state of omniscience. _In the present context of Karma-Nirjara, the least Nirjara is experienced by the Samyagdarshi and the most by the omniscient. The names of the stages in the increasing order of Karma-Nirjara are as follows: Samyagdarshi, Shravak, Virat, Ananta-Anubandhi-Viyojak, Darshan-Moh-Kshapak, Moho-Upshamk, Upshant-Moh, Kshapk, Ksheen-Moh, and Jin. These stages are successively characterized by innumerable degrees of Nirjara. However, the time taken for each stage is progressively less than the previous one. This means that the time taken for Karma-Nirjara by the Samyagdarshi is less than that taken by the Shravak. Similarly, it should be understood for the Virat and subsequent stages._

Out of the fourteen Gunasthanas, five Gunasthanas (1, 4, 5, 6, and 13) are eternal in the Lok, meaning they always exist. The remaining nine Gunasthanas are non-eternal. While going to the Parbhav, the first, second, and fourth Gunasthanas remain. The third, twelfth, and thirteenth Gunasthanas are immortal. 1. (a) Samyagdarshi, Shravak, Virat, Ananta-Viyojak, Darshan-Moh-Kshapak, Upshamk, Upshant-Moh-Kshapak, Ksheen-Moh, and Jin are successively characterized by innumerable degrees of Nirjara.

The second Karmagrantha, meaning that the soul does not die in these. 1, 2, 3, 5, and 11, these five Gunasthanas are not traversed by Tirthankaras. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, in these five Gunasthanas, the soul binds the Tirthankara Gotra. 12, 13, and 14, these three Gunasthanas are A-pratipati, meaning that once they are attained, they are not left. 1, 4, 7, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, the soul must traverse these nine Gunasthanas before attaining Moksha.

Thus, the nature of the Gunasthanas has been briefly described here. To understand it in detail, one should study other texts.

Before describing the state of binding, arising, excitation, and existence of Karma-prakritis in each Gunasthana, we will first describe the characteristics of binding and the Karma-prakritis that are capable of being bound in each Gunasthana, as indicated in the Mangalacharan.

Abhinayakammargahanam, bandho ohen tattha yos sayam. Titthayaraharag-bugawanjam michhami satar-sayam ||3||

Meaning of the verse: The acceptance of new Karmas is called binding. Without any specific intention of a particular Gunasthana or a particular soul, 120 Karma-prakritis are capable of being bound. Among them, except for the Tirthankara-namakarma and Aharak-dwik, the remaining 117 Karma-prakritis are bound in the Gunasthana with Mithyatva.

Specific meaning: The acceptance of new Karmas is called binding. In the same space-field where the soul's regions are, the Pudgala Skandhas, which have the potential to be transformed into Karma-rupa, are bound in the Gunasthana with Mithyatva.

Page #86:
---------------------------
The act of a soul accepting karmic particles in their karmic form is called **abhinava-navina karmagrahan** (new karma acceptance), and this new karma acceptance is called **bandha** (bondage).

The relationship after **bandha** is not called **bandha** because it becomes integrated into the soul's existence. Similarly, when karmas bound to the soul, through a specific result, abandon one nature and acquire another, this acquisition of a different nature should be understood as **samkraman** (transition), not **bandha**.

With this intention, the **karmagrahan** alone is not called **bandha**, but the **abhinava karmagrahan** is described as the characteristic of **bandha** in the **gatha** (verse). This means that the qualifier '**abhinava**' (new) given in the characteristic of **bandha** is like calling the water in a river **shoka nanda** (joy of sorrow). However, karmas existing in the form of existence and transitioning into a different nature are not called **bandha**.

The ability of karmic particles to cover the natural qualities of the soul, such as knowledge and perception, is called the transformation of karmic particles into their karmic form. The transformation of karmic particles into their karmic form occurs due to factors such as **mithyatva** (false belief), **avirati** (non-restraint), **pramada** (carelessness), **kashaya** (passions), and **yoga** (attachment). These are the inherent (distorted) nature of the soul, and they cause the karmic particles to transform into their karmic form.

The inherent states, such as **mithyatva**, that cause the karmic particles to become karmic forms are called **bhavakarma** (motivating karma), and the karmic particles that have acquired their karmic form are called **dravya karma** (material karma). There is a mutual dependence between the two. According to the previously accepted **dravya karma**, **bhavakarma** and...

1. **Satta karmagathi bandhai sar attalamaanam.** (The bondage of existence is the ultimate truth.)

Page #87:

## Financial Karma Text

**51** According to Bhava Karma, new Karmas continue to be bound. In this way, the binding of Dravya Karma by Bhava Karma and Bhava Karma by Dravya Karma, such a continuous chain of cause and effect has been going on since time immemorial.

Without specifying any particular Gunasthan and any particular Jiva, the Karma-prakritis that are capable of being bound are considered to be 120. Therefore, the binding of these 120 Karma-prakritis is called **Samanya Bandha** or **Ogh Bandha**.

Although a single Jiva cannot transform the Karma-pudgalas into 120 forms at any one time in any state, i.e., cannot bind 120 Karma-prakritis, yet many can bind 120 Karma-prakritis at one time. Similarly, a Jiva can also bind 120 Karma-prakritis in different states at different times. This is because the Karma-pudgalas can be transformed into 120 types according to the Jiva's Mithyatva, etc. Therefore, 120 Karma-prakritis are considered to be capable of being bound.

The names of the 120 Karma-prakritis that are capable of being bound and the number of their Uttar-prakritis are as follows:

(1) **Jnanavarana** - 5 types
(2) **Darshanavarana** - 18 types
(3) **Vedaniya** - 2 types
(4) **Mohaniya** - 26 types
(5) **Aaya** - 4 types
(6) **Nama** - 67 types
(7) **Gotra** - 8 types
(8) **Antaraya** - 5 types

These Jnanavarana, etc. Karmas have 5, 18, 2, 26, 4, 67, 8, and 5 Uttar-prakritis respectively.

Page #88:

52
Karmastava
- There are 120 karma-prakritis considered to be bandha-yogya (capable of binding) due to the combination of 2+5 bhedas (categories). Although there are 63 or 103 prakritis of nama-karma in detail, the reason for mentioning 67 prakritis here in the bandha-yogya prakritis is that bandha (binding) and sanghatan (aggregation) are inseparable in the case of sharira nama-karma. That is, they cannot exist without the body. Therefore, in the bandha or udaya (arising) state, bandha and sanghatan nama-karma are not counted separately from sharira nama-karma and are included in the sharira nama-prakriti. Also, due to the desire for non-difference (abheda-vivksha) in the four categories of varna (color), gandha (smell), rasa (taste), and sparsa (touch), their twenty bhedas are included, resulting in four bhedas being taken in the bandha and udaya states. 1. Panch nav donni chhanni samvi ya charo kaman satchhi. Vopi ya panch pa bhania edao mandha paydio.
- According to the Go. Karmakan, 35 karma-prakritis are bandha-yogya due to abheda-vivksha (desire for non-difference). However, due to bheda-vivksha (desire to speak of difference), there are 146 karma-prakritis that are bandha-yogya. This is because, out of the three bhedas of darshan moha (perception-delusion) - samyaktva (rightness), samyagmithyatva (partially rightness), and mithyatva (wrongness) - only the mula mithyatva prakriti is considered bandha-yogya. The reason for this is that the bound mithyatva prakriti is categorized by the jiva (soul) into three maags (paths) through its parinamas (transformations) - ashudha (impure), ardhashudha (partially pure), and vishudha (pure). This results in three bhedas of mithyatva. Among them, the vishudha karma-pudgals are called samyaktva-mohaniya (capable of being deluded by rightness) and the ardhashudha karma-pudgals are called sampamithyatva-mohaniya (capable of being deluded by partially rightness). Therefore, by not including the two prakritis of samyaktva and samyagmithyatva of mohaniya-karma in the bandha-yogya prakritis, 146 prakritis are considered bandha-yogya due to bheda-vivksha.
In the first karma-grantha (text on karma), the names of the eight prakritis that are generally bandha-yogya, udaya-yogya, etc., have been mentioned. Therefore, they are not mentioned again here.

Page #89:
---------------------------
## Second Karma Granth

Sixty-seven types of **Nama Karma** are counted among the number of **Bandha-yoga** (bondable) **Prakritis**.

Out of the aforementioned 120 **Karma Prakṛitis** that are generally **Bandha-yoga**, the **Tirthankara Nama Karma**, **Aharaka-Dwik-Aharaka-Sharira** and **Aharaka-Angopanga** - these three **Karma Prakṛitis** do not bind in the **Mithyatva** (false belief) **Gunasthan** (state of being). In other words, these three **Karma Prakṛitis** are not **Bandha-yoga** in the **Mithyatva** **Gunasthan**. The reason for this is that the binding of **Tirthankara Nama Karma** occurs through **Samyaktava** (right faith) and the binding of **Aharaka-Dwik** occurs through **Aparamatta-Samyama** (unwavering restraint). However, in the **Mithyatva** **Gunasthan**, it is not possible for beings to attain **Samyaktava** or **Aparamatta-Samyama**. This is because **Samyaktava** cannot occur before the fourth **Gunasthan** - **Avirata-Samyak-Drishti** (uninterrupted right faith) - and **Aparamatta-Samyama** cannot occur before the seventh **Gunasthan** - **Aparamatta-Samyata** (unwavering restraint). Therefore, beings in the **Mithyatva** **Gunasthan**, due to the presence of **Mithyatva**, **Avirati** (non-restraint), **Pramada** (carelessness), **Kashaya** (passions) and **Yoga** (bondage) - the causes of binding - can bind the remaining 117 **Karma Prakṛitis** to the best of their ability, without the aforementioned three. Therefore, in the **Mithyatva** **Gunasthan**, there are 117 **Bandha-yoga** **Prakṛitis** and 3 **Abandha-yoga** (non-bondable) **Prakṛitis**.

Now, in the following verse, we discuss the 1 **Bandha-vichheda-yoga** (bond-breaking) **Prakriti** in the **Mithyatva** **Gunasthan**:

1. **Dehe Avinamāyī Bandhanasanghad Idi Abandhudaya. Vashnachoukke'abhinne Gahide Chattari Bandhudaye.** - **Go. Karmakanda 34**

2. **Abandha** - In that **Gunasthan**, that **Karma** does not bind, but in the subsequent **Gunasthan**, the binding of that **Karma** occurs. This is called **Abandha**.

3. **Sammeva Titthavandha Aharadurga Pamadarahidesu.** - **Go. Karmakanda 62**

4. **Bandha-vichheda** - The absence of binding in any subsequent **Gunasthan** is called **Bandha-vichheda**. **Chheva**, **Kshaya**, **Anta**, **Bheda**, etc. are synonymous terms.

These are the names of the sixteen types of karmas that are severed at the end of the first Mithyatva Gunasthan, along with the natures described by the terms Naraka Trika, etc.:

(1) Naraka Gati,
(3) Naraka Ayu, (5) Dvi-Indriya Jati, (7) Chatur-Indriya Jati, (9) Sukshma Nama,

(10) Apariapta Nama,
(12) Inda Sansthan, (14) Seva-rta Sanhanan, (16) Mithyatva-mohaniya.

It should be understood that the causes of karma-bandha in the Gunasthanas are such that the karmas that are bound due to the causes of Mithyatva, etc., are also bound up to the Gunasthanas where those causes arise.

The Mithyatva-mohaniya karma arises until the end of the first Mithyatva Gunasthan, and not in the second Gunasthan. Therefore, due to the arising of the Mithyatva-mohaniya karma, the sixteen types of karmas, from Naraka Trika to Mithyatva-mohaniya, as shown in the gatha, are bound, which are extremely inauspicious and mostly suitable for Naraka, Eka-Indriya, and Vikala-Indriya beings.

##  56

The binding of karmas, or karmic influences, to the soul can occur until the end of the first stage of spiritual development (guna-sthana), as long as the delusion of false belief (mithyatva-mohaniya) persists. This binding does not occur in the second stage. Therefore, out of the 117 karmic influences that are considered to be bound in the first stage, 101 remain bound in the second stage, excluding the 16 influences like naraka-trika (hellish influences).

The verse states that the binding of the karmic influences listed in the "tirithi-ona-duha-gati-patra" (a list of karmic influences) is severed in the second stage. The names of the other karmic influences that are severed in the second stage, as well as the number of karmic influences that can be bound in the third stage, are mentioned in the following verse:

"Ananta-anubandhi-chatushk, madhyama-samsthana-chatushk, madhyama-samhanana-chatushk, nicha-gola, udyota-nama, ashubha-vihayo-gati-nama, and stri-veda, these 25 karmic influences are severed at the end of the second stage. Due to the absence of the binding of ayu-dvik (the karmic influence related to lifespan), 74 karmic influences are bound in the mixed stage (samyama-dristi-guna-sthana)."

**Explanation:**

In the second stage, 101 karmic influences are eligible for binding, and 25 are severed at the end of this stage. The names of these 25 severed karmic influences are mentioned in the previous verse using the phrase "tirithi-ona-duha-gati-gam," which refers to the nine karmic influences of tiryancha-trika, styana-dhitrika, and durbhaga-trika. This verse further lists the names of 16 karmic influences, starting from "ananta-anubandhi-chatushk" and ending with "stri-veda."

Therefore, the previous verse mentions nine karmic influences, and this verse mentions sixteen, totaling 25 karmic influences that are severed at the end of the second stage.

Page #93:
---------------------------
## Second

Combining the sixteen Prakṛtis, there are a total of 25 Prakṛtis that become disintegrated at the end of the second Guṇasthāna. The author has mentioned four of these 25 Prakṛtis separately: Selicgotra Udyotanāma, Aprashasta Vihayogatināma, and Strīveda. The names of the remaining 21 Prakṛtis are given by the following terms: Narakanik, Styānaddhivik, Durbhagatrik, Anantānubandhīcaturṣka, Madhyamasansthānacaturṣka, Madhyamasanhannacaturṣka.

The names of the Prakṛtis included in these terms are as follows:

* **Tiyancatrik:** Tiyancatra, Tiyancagati, Tich-Anupūrvi, Tichary-Āyu
* **Styānaddhivik:** Nidrā-Nidrā, Prachalā-Prachalā, Tyānaddhi
* **Durbhagatrik:** Durbhaganāma, Du.svaranāma, Anādayanāma
* **Anantānubandhīcaturṣka:** Anantānubandhī Krodha, Māna, Māyā, Lobha
* **Madhyamasansthānacaturṣka:** Nyagrodhaparimandalamansthāna, Sādisansthāna, Vāmanasansthāna, Kubjasansthāna
* **Madhyamasanhannacaturṣka:** Ṛṣabhanārācasanhannana, Nārācasanhannana, Ardhanārācasanhannana, Kīlikā Sanshana

The 25 Karma Prakṛtis, from Tiyancatrik to Strīveda, become disintegrated at the end of the second Guṇasthāna. This means that they cannot be bound in the third, fourth, or subsequent Guṇasthānas. The reason for this is that the binding of these 25 Prakṛtis occurs due to the arising of Anantānubandhīkaṣāya, and Anantānubandhīkaṣāya arises only in the first and second Guṇasthānas, not in the third or subsequent Guṇasthānas. Therefore, out of the 101 Prakṛtis that can be bound in the second Guṇasthāna,

Page #94:
---------------------------
## Translation:

The 25 Prakṛtis, starting with the Tiryanc-trika, should be considered as not subject to bondage, reducing the total number of bondable Prakṛtis to 76.
**Karmastava**
**In the Guṇasthāna**
However, the nature of a being in the third Guṇasthāna, the mixed Guṇasthāna (Samyag-mithyā-dṛṣṭi Guṇasthāna), is such that at that time, neither death occurs nor is there bondage of the lifespan related to the future birth. This is because in the state of mixed Guṇasthāna and mixed Kāya-yoga, there cannot be bondage of Āyu-karma. Therefore, since the bondage of Naraka-āyu occurs up to the first Guṇasthāna and the bondage of Tichā-āyu occurs up to the second Guṇasthāna, and the remaining two Āyus, Manushya-āyu and Deva-āyu, are not bound in the third Guṇasthāna, the total of 27 Prakṛtis, including the 25 Prakṛtis starting with the Naraka-trika and Manushya-āyu and Deva-āyu, are reduced from the 101 bondable Prakṛtis of the Sāsādana Guṇasthāna, leaving 74 remaining Prakṛtis that are bondable in the third Guṇasthāna.
Now, in the following verse, we will explain the number and names of the bondable Prakṛtis in the fourth Avirata-samyag-dṛṣṭi, fifth Deśa-virata, and sixth Pramatta-samyata Guṇasthānas.
**Samme Sagari Jinau-bandhi, Badar Narati-g Viyak-say | Ural-ganto Base Base, Satsatthi Ti-af-santo ||6||**
**Gāyārtha:** In the fourth Guṇasthāna called Avirata-samyag-dṛṣṭi, there can be bondage of 77 Prakṛtis due to the bondage of the Jin-tīrthaṅkara Nāma-karma and two Āyus. Due to the liberation of Vajra-ṛṣabha-nārācha-samhanana, Manushya-trika, Apratyākhyāna-āvaraṇa-kaṣāya-chatuṣka, and Audārika-dvīka, the fifth Guṇasthāna called Deśa-virata

## Financial Karma Granth

In the Financial Karma Granth, 64 natures are bound, and the severance of the third kashaya - the fourfold kashaya of rejection and concealment - occurs at the end of the fifth guna-sthana. Therefore, 63 natures are eligible for binding in the sixth guna-sthana, the Prammatta-Samyata guna-sthana. To determine the name of the sixth guna-sthana and the number of natures eligible for binding, the phrase "Tevachhipamatte" should be taken from the following verse.

This verse specifically indicates the names of the natures eligible for binding and those that are severed in the fourth, fifth, and sixth guna-sthana.

First, we will discuss the number of natures eligible for binding in the fourth guna-sthana:

In the third guna-sthana, 74 natures are eligible for binding, and no nature is severed in this guna-sthana. Therefore, 74 natures should have been eligible for binding in the Avira-Samyag-Drishti guna-sthana. However, due to the principle of "Sammeva Titthabandha," only the Tirthankara nature is bound in Samyag-Drishti. This principle allows for the binding of the Tirthankara name in the fourth guna-sthana. Similarly, according to the principle of "Sammâmi Châditthî Uyabandhaṁ Pi Na Karei Tti," the binding of both human and divine lifespans, which did not occur in the third guna-sthana, can occur in the fourth guna-sthana.

Therefore, along with the three natures of Tirthankara name, human lifespan, and divine lifespan, the following natures are eligible for binding in the fourth guna-sthana:

1. The binding of Naraka lifespan and Tiryancha lifespan is severed in the first and second guna-sthana, respectively. Therefore, these two natures, human lifespan and divine lifespan, remain eligible for binding.

## English Translation:

**6**
The 74 karma-prakritis can also be bound, therefore, a total of 77 karma-prakritis are considered to be bound in the fourth guna-sthana.
In the fourth guna-sthana, if the present devas and narakas bind the lifespan related to the past, then they bind the human lifespan and the lifespan of the vichayas, and they bind the lifespan of humans and the lifespan of the tiryanch devas.
Now, in the fifth desa-virat guna-sthana, we will explain the number of bindable prakritis, their names, causes, etc.
In the fifth guna-sthana, 67 prakritis are bound. Out of the 77 bindable prakritis in the fourth guna-sthana, the binding of Vajra-rishabha-naracha-samhanana, Manuyya-nik-manushya-gati, Manushya-anupurvi and Manushya-ayu, Apratyakhyana-avaran-chatuhak - Apratyakhyana-avaran-krodha, Apratyakhyana-acharan-mana, Apratyakhyana-avaran-maya, Apratyakhyana-avaran-lobha and Audarik-dwik-Audarik-sharira, Audarik-angopaang, these 10 prakritis are unbound at the end of the fourth guna-sthana, resulting in the birth of 67 prakritis in the fifth guna-sthana.

**1**
In the pachitra and other guna-sthanas, the binding of karma-prakritis that are eligible for human birth does not occur, only the binding of karma-prakritis that are eligible for deva birth occurs. Therefore, these three karma-prakritis - Manushya-gati, Manushya-anupurvi and Manushya-ayu - are only eligible for human birth, and these three karma-prakritis - Vajra-rishabha-naracha-samhanana, Audarik-sharira and Audarik-angopaang - are only eligible for experiencing in human or tiryanch birth, so these six prakritis are not bound in the fifth and other guna-sthanas.
The four kshayas - Apratyakhyana-avaran-krodha, mana, maya and lobha -

---------------------------
The binding of the second karma-prakriti occurs only until the end of the fourth guna-sthana, not in the subsequent guna-sthana. This is because the general rule for the binding of karma is that the binding of a particular kshaya occurs in as many guna-sthana as the kshaya can arise.

A being residing in the fifth guna-sthana, called "desh-virat", is one who observes "desh-samyama".  "Desh-virat" refers to one who observes "desh-samyama". The kshaya that prevents "desh-samyama" is "apratyakhyana-avaran". Therefore, as long as this kshaya arises, the being will not be able to attain the fifth guna-sthana.

Thus, out of the 75 bindable prakritis in the fourth guna-sthana, ten prakritis, from "baj-rishabha-nara-acha-samhanana" to "oudarik-ango-paanga", are severed at the end of the fourth guna-sthana, leaving 67 prakritis to be bound in the fifth guna-sthana.

Out of these 67 bindable prakritis in the fifth guna-sthana, the "pratyakhyana-avaran-chaturshka" - the four kshayas of "pratyakhyana-avaran", "krodha", "mana", "maya", and "lobha" - arise only until the fifth guna-sthana and are severed at the end of the fifth guna-sthana. Therefore, excluding these four kshayas, the remaining 63 prakritis are bindable in the sixth "pramat-virat" guna-sthana. In other words, the binding of the four kshayas of "pratyakhyana-avaran", "krodha", etc., occurs only until the end of the fifth guna-sthana, not in the subsequent guna-sthana. This is because if these kshayas arise, the sixth guna-sthana cannot be attained. Therefore, "pratyakhyana-avaran"

Except for the four *kṣayās* (passions) - anger, pride, deceit, and greed - the remaining 63 *prakṛtis* (natural tendencies) are considered to be capable of binding in the sixth *guṇasthāna* (stage of spiritual development).

Having explained the number of *bandha-yoga* (binding) *prakṛtis* in the fourth, fifth, and sixth *guṇasthāna*, we now proceed to explain the number, names, and characteristics of the *bandha-yoga* *prakṛtis* in the seventh *guṇasthāna*, the *apramatta* (non-negligent) stage, in the next two verses.

**Verse 7:**

*Tevaṭṭhi patte soga arai adhirayuga ajaśa assāyam. Bucclijja chhacca satta ba ne i surajam jaya niṭṭham.*

**Verse 8:**

*Guṇasatṭi appamatte suraubandhaṁ tu jaḍa ihāgacche. Agraha aṭṭhāvaṇṇā jaṁ āhāragam bandhe.*

**Meaning of the Verses:**

The binding of the remaining 63 *prakṛtis* occurs in the *apramatta-samyata* (non-negligent and controlled) *guṇasthāna*. The binding of the six *prakṛtis* - sorrow, aversion, instability, ill-fame, and the *asātavēdaniya* (unbearable) - is severed at the end of the sixth *guṇasthāna*. The binding of the *āhārakadvika* (food-related) *prakṛtis* occurs in the *apramatta-samyata* *guṇasthāna*, resulting in the binding of 56 *prakṛtis*. If a being begins the binding of the *devāyu* (divine) *prakṛtis* in the sixth *guṇasthāna* and completes it in the same *guṇasthāna*, then, in comparison, the binding of the six *prakṛtis* - aversion, etc. - and the *devāyu* - a total of seven *prakṛtis* - is severed, resulting in the binding of 58 *prakṛtis*.

**Special Meaning:**

The verses explain the number of *bandha-yoga* *prakṛtis* in the seventh *apramatta-samyata* *guṇasthāna*. They state that out of the 63 *prakṛtis* capable of binding in the sixth *guṇasthāna*, the binding of the six *prakṛtis* - sorrow, aversion, instability, ill-fame, and the *asātavēdaniya* - is severed...

## Second Karma

**63**

At the end of the sixth *guna-sthana*, 57 *prakritis* should be bound in the seventh *guna-sthana*. However, in this *guna-sthana*, two *prakritis* - *aaharaka-sharira* (the body of the *aaharaka*) and *aaharaka-angopaanga* (the limbs of the *aaharaka*) - are also eligible for binding, making a total of 56 *prakritis* eligible for binding. But those beings who achieve the seventh *guna-sthana* after severing the bond of *deva-ayu* in the sixth *guna-sthana* itself, have 58 *prakritis* considered eligible for binding in the seventh *guna-sthana*.

The reason for this difference is that there are two types of beings who attain the seventh *guna-sthana*:

(1) Those who begin the *desh-yuka* in the sixth *guna-sthana* and attain the seventh *guna-sthana* without ending it in the same *guna-sthana*, and sever the bond of *deva-ayu* in the seventh *guna-sthana*.

(2) Those who begin and sever the bond of *deva-ayu* both in the sixth *guna-sthana* itself, and then attain the seventh *guna-sthana*.

Of these two types of beings, the first type sever the bond of six *prakritis* - *shoka* (sorrow), *arati* (disgust), *asthiranama* (unstable name), *ashubhanam* (inauspicious name), *arrata* (unsteadiness), and *asataavedaniya* (unpleasant) - at the end of the sixth *guna-sthana* before attaining the seventh *guna-sthana*. Therefore, compared to these beings, 57 *prakritis* should be eligible for binding in the seventh *guna-sthana* after subtracting the six *prakritis* of *arati*, *shoka*, etc. from the 63 *prakritis* eligible for binding in the sixth *guna-sthana*. However, since the emergence of *aaharaka-sharira* and *aaharaka-angopaanga* occurs in the seventh *guna-sthana*, their binding also occurs in the seventh *guna-sthana*. Therefore, adding these two *prakritis* to the 57 *prakritis*, there are 59 *prakritis* eligible for binding in the seventh *guna-sthana*.

**56**

**Karmastava**

However, in the sixth guna-sthana, the liberation of the deva-ayu is achieved, and those who attain the seventh guna-sthana are considered to have 58 bound karmas in the seventh guna-sthana. This is because the liberation of the six prakritis (arati, shoka, etc.) and the deva-ayu, a total of seven prakritis, occurs at the end of the sixth guna-sthana. This leaves 56 prakritis out of the 63, which are combined with the aharak-dvik to form the 58 bound karmas in the seventh guna-sthana.

The essence of both statements is that those who attain the seventh guna-sthana without having initiated and completed the binding of the deva-ayu in the sixth guna-sthana, are considered to have 58 bound karmas in the seventh guna-sthana. This is in contrast to those who initiate and complete the binding of the prakritis and the deva-ayu in the sixth guna-sthana before attaining the seventh guna-sthana.

The calculation of the binding of the deva-ayu in the seventh guna-sthana implies that the deva-ayu binds only the pramatta (deluded) beings, but not the aprammatta (non-deluded) beings due to their highly purified and stable karmic results. Therefore, a being who has bound the deva-ayu in the sixth guna-sthana and has not liberated it in the same guna-sthana, but has attained the seventh guna-sthana due to its purified karmic results, and has liberated the deva-ayu in this guna-sthana, is considered to have bound the deva-ayu in the seventh guna-sthana. In this case, 56 prakritis are considered to be bound. However, the binding of the deva-ayu does not begin in the seventh guna-sthana.

After discussing the bound karmas in the seventh guna-sthana, we will now discuss the number and names of the bound karmas in the eighth apuurvakarana, ninth anivrittikarana, and tenth sukshmasampraaya guna-sthana in three verses.

## Second Karma Granth

**Verse 6:**

At the beginning of the eighth *apuurvakarana* *gunasthan*, fifty-six are bound in five parts by ending the *atthavan* and *nidradvik*. In the sixth part, fifty-six are bound by ending the *suradrik*, *panchendriyajati*, *shubhavihayogati*, *sanavak*, and all bodies and limbs except the *oudarikasharira*, *samachatursrasansthan*, *nirman*, *jinnam*, *varnachatushk*, and *agurulbuchatushk*.

**Verse 10:**

In the final part, twenty-six are bound by ending the *chali*, *birgo*, and *charme*.

**Verse 11:**

In the *anivritti* *gunasthan*, twenty-two are bound by ending *hasya*, *rati*, *jugupsa*, and *bhaya*. In the *bhagapange*, *igegaheen* and *duvosbihabando* are bound. In the *pumsanjalanchaturnham*, seventeen are bound in the *sukshmasampray* by the action of *kame*, *ched*, and *sukshmasampray* respectively.

**Gathaarth:**

At the beginning of the *apuurvakarana* *gunasthan*, fifty-six are bound in five parts by ending the *atthavan* and *nidradvik*.

In the *pumsanjalanchaturnham*, seventeen are bound in the *sukshmasampray* by the action of *kame*, *ched*, and *sukshmasampray* respectively.

**Vishesharth:**

These three verses describe the number and names of the *bandhyogya* (bindable) *prakritis* in the eighth *apuurvakarana*, ninth *anivrittibadasampray*, and tenth *sukshmasampray* *gunasthanas*. They explain the number, names, *bandhavicched* (binding-breaking) *prakriti* number, and causes of the *bandhyogya* *prakritis* in the eighth *gunasthan*.

does not bind. Although the binding of 56 natures is mentioned in the seventh guna-sthana, it includes devayu. To understand this, it should be known that the devayu center initiated in the sixth guna-sthana continues in the seventh. Therefore, from that perspective, devayu is included in the 56 bindable natures of the seventh guna-sthana. However, the binding of devayu does not begin in the seventh guna-sthana, and in the eighth and subsequent guna-sthana, neither the beginning nor the end of devayu's binding occurs. Therefore, excluding devayu, the remaining 58 natures are bindable in the first part of the eighth guna-sthana.

The state of the eighth guna-sthana is an antarmukhurta measure, and it has seven parts. In the first part, the binding of 58 natures occurs, and at the end of the first part, the binding of the two natures - nidradvik, nidra, and prachala - is severed. Then, in the remaining five parts from the second to the sixth, the binding of 56 natures occurs.

Of these 56 natures, the binding of the following 30 natures is severed at the end of the sixth part:
—
Suradvak - Devagati, Deva-anupurvi, Panchendriya-jati, Shubhavihayogati, Asatvak (As, Badar, Paryapt, Pratyek, Sthir, Shubh, Subhag, Suswar, Aadey), Vaikriyasarira-nam, Aharak-sarira-nam, Taijas-sarira-nam, Karman-sarira-nam, Vaikriya Angopang, Aharak Angopang, Samachaturasra-samsthan, Nirman-nam, Tirthankar-nam, Varnachatusk (Varna, Gandh, Ras and

Page #103:

The second Karma Grantha, called Sparsha Nama, has four sub-categories: Aguhal Ghunama, Upghata Nama, Paraghata Nama, and Ucchvasa Nama.

These 30 types of Nama Karma are bound only up to the sixth part of the eighth Gunasthan, not beyond. Therefore, subtracting these 30 types from the aforementioned 56 types, the remaining 26 types are bound in the seventh part of the eighth Gunasthan.

Of the remaining 26 types that are eligible for binding in the final seventh part of the eighth Gunasthan, the binding of the last four types - Hasy, Rati, Jugupsa, and Bhaya - which are part of the Nokashaya Mohaniya Karma, is severed at the end. Therefore, they are not bound in the ninth and subsequent Gunasthanas.

Now, we will explain the number, name, etc., of the types eligible for binding in the ninth and tenth Gunasthanas.

The duration of the ninth Gunasthan is Antarmuhurt, and it has five parts. Therefore, after the severance of the four types - Hasy, Rati, Jugupsa, and Bhaya - at the end of the seventh part of the eighth Gunasthan, 22 types remain in the first part of the ninth Gunasthan. 1. Compare.-.

Karma has its own bondage. After this, the bondage of each of the five natures, namely, *purushaveda*, *sanjvalana krodha*, *sanjvalana mana*, *sanjvalana maya*, and *sanjvalana lobha*, is severed in the final time of each of the five parts of the ninth *gunasthan*. Their order of severance is explained below.

In the first part of the ninth *gunasthan*, the severance of *purushaveda* takes place in the final time, leaving 21 natures bound in the second part. Of these 21 natures, the severance of *sanjvalana krodha* takes place in the final time of the second part. Therefore, the remaining 20 natures are bound in the third part. Of these 20 natures, the severance of *sanjvalana mana* takes place in the final time of the third part, leaving 19 natures bound in the fourth part. And in the final time of the fourth part, the severance of *sanjvalana maya* takes place, leaving 18 natures bound in the fifth part.

Thus, 18 natures are bound in the fifth part of the ninth *gunasthan*. Of these 18 natures, the bondage of *sanjvalana lobha* continues until the fifth part of the ninth *gunasthan*, and in the final time of this part, the severance of *sanjvalana lobha* takes place, leaving 17 natures bound in the tenth *gunasthan*.

Thus, after stating the number and names of the natures that are subject to bondage in the eighth, ninth, and tenth *gunasthan*, the following verse continues:

## P Financial Karma Granth

This text explains the **bandha-yoga** (binding) nature of the eleven to fourteenth **guna-sthana** (stages of spiritual development).

**Verse 12:**

The **bandha-vichched** (release from binding) of the sixteen **prakriti** (natures) - four **darshanavaran** (obscurations of perception), **uchcha-gotra** (high lineage), **yasha-kirti-nama** (fame and reputation), and ten **jnana-avaran** (obscurations of knowledge) - occurs at the end of the tenth **guna-sthana**. Therefore, in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth **guna-sthana**, only **satavedaniya karma** (karma that can be experienced) is bound. In the **sayogikevali guna-sthana** (stage of perfect liberation), even this is released, ending all binding in the fourteenth **guna-sthana**.

**Explanation:**

This verse describes the **bandha-yoga** nature of the eleven to thirteenth **guna-sthana** and explains the state of **abandha** (non-binding) in the fourteenth **guna-sthana** and its cause.

Although the **sthula lobha-kṣaya** (gross greed) does not arise in the tenth **guna-sthana**, a subtle **lobha-kṣaya** remains. This subtle **kṣaya** (passion) is not a cause of binding. However, a very subtle aspect of **kṣaya** remains in the tenth **guna-sthana**. Therefore, due to the presence of **kṣaya** and **yoga** (union) as the cause of binding, the four **darshanavaran** (**chakshu-darshanavaran**, **achakshu-darshanavaran**, **avadhi-darshanavaran**, **keval-darshanavaran**), **uchcha-gotra**, **yasha-kirti-nama**, five **jnana-avaran** (**mati-jnana-avaran**, **shruta-jnana-avaran**, **avadhi-jnana-avaran**, **manah-paryaya-jnana-avaran**, **keval-jnana-avaran**), and five **antaraya** (**dana-antaraya**, **laba-antaraya**, **bhoga-antaraya**, **upbhoga-antaraya**, **dirgha-antaraya**) remain bound.

Page #106:
---------------------------
The binding of the 16 natural tendencies and the 7 *saataavedaniya* (seven sense-object) tendencies, which are a total of 17 tendencies caused by yoga, occurs in the tenth *gunasthan* (stage of spiritual progress).

At the end of the tenth *gunasthan*, the subtle *kashaya* (passions) are destroyed, and as a result, the binding of the aforementioned 16 natural tendencies, including the four *darshanavaran* (veils of perception), is broken. However, since yoga is still present, the *saataavedaniya* tendency caused by yoga remains bindable in the eleventh *gunasthan* (called *upshant* - calm, *kashaya* - passionless, *chhadmasth* - disguised), the twelfth *gunasthan* (called *kshinakashaya* - subtle passion, *vitaraag* - passionless, *chhadmasth* - disguised), and the thirteenth *gunasthan* (called *sayogikevali* - liberated with yoga).

After this, in the fourteenth *gunasthan* (called *ayogikevali* - liberated without yoga), since yoga is absent due to the absence of binding, neither karma is bound nor is there any breaking of binding. Therefore, in the fourteenth *gunasthan*, the state of *abandhak* (non-binding) is attained.

Attaining this state of *abandhak* is the goal of the soul, and after attaining it, the soul remains absorbed in its own nature.

In this way, the number, names, and breaking of binding of the bindable tendencies in each of the fourteen *gunasthan* have been explained.

The five causes of karmic binding are: *mithyatva* (false belief), *aviraati* (non-restraint), *pramad* (carelessness), *kashaya* (passions), and *yoga* (attachment). Regarding the number of these causes of binding, the following three traditions are seen:

1. Compare:
* "First, the three *trigdha* (threefold), *darshan* (perception), *ujas* (light), and *guhumant* (hidden)."
* "Then, *uvasant* (calm), *khin* (subtle), *moha* (delusion), *yog* (attachment), *nihi* (annihilation), *samavi* (equal), *yadi* (if), *sad* (true)." - *Gommatsar*, *Karmakand*, 102
2. "The causes of binding are: *mithyatva* (false belief), *aviraati* (non-restraint), *pramad* (carelessness), *kashaya* (passions), and *yoga* (attachment)." - *Tattvarth Sutra*, 8-1
- *Gommatsar*, *Karmakand*, 101

Page #107:
---------------------------
## Financial Karma Granth

(1) **Kashaya** and **Yoga** - both are the causes of bondage. (2) **Mithyatva**, **Avirati**, **Kashaya** and **Yoga** - these four are the causes of bondage. (3) **Mithyatva**, **Avirati**, **Pramada**, **Kashaya** and **Yoga** - these five are the causes of bondage. In this way, even though there are differences in number and names, there is no difference in essence in these three traditions. **Vak Pramada** is a type of **Asanyama**. Therefore, it is included in **Avirati** or **Kashaya**. And when examined closely, **Mithyatva** and **Asanyama** are not separate from the nature of **Kashaya**. Therefore, **Kashaya** and **Yoga** are considered as the causes of bondage.

_In the Karma Granth, the role of spiritual development in the **Gunasthanas** is explained by mentioning the four causes of bondage - **Mithyatva**, **Avirati**, **Kashaya** and **Yoga**. These causes explain the state of development of the soul. Therefore, the more causes of bondage are present in a **Gunasthan**, the more the bondage of **Karma** will be in that **Gunasthan**. And where these causes of bondage are less, the bondage of **Karma** will also be less. In other words, the tradition of mentioning the four causes - **Mithyatva** etc. - is adopted in the **Karma Granth** to explain the reasons for the bondage of **Karma** that is obtained in different **Gunasthanas**._

_It is a simple rule regarding the bondage of **Karma** that the bondage of **Karma** continues as long as the causes of bondage exist._

Karmastava
The binding of karma-prakritis does not occur due to the absence of any one cause. The binding of all other karma-prakritis occurs.
For example, the binding of the aforementioned 16 karma-prakritis, such as narakatrika, which are extinguished at the end of the Mithyatva gunasthan, occurs due to the four causes of Mithyatva, Aviriti, Kashaya, and Yoga. These four causes remain until the end of the first gunasthan, therefore the binding of the aforementioned 16 karma-prakritis can also occur until that time. But Mithyatva does not remain beyond the first gunasthan, therefore the binding of the aforementioned sixteen prakritis, such as Kak, also does not occur beyond the first gunasthan. Similarly, the binding and severance of other karma-prakritis depends on the presence and absence of the binding causes.
For the classification of gunasthanas in relation to these binding causes, the number of bindable prakritis, their names and causes, etc., see the appendix.
Thus, after stating the karma-prakritis in the gunasthanas, the next verse, as per the instructions, clarifies the characteristics of Uday and Udirana, the number of Uday-worthy prakritis, and the number of prakritis that attain Uday in the first Mithyatva gunasthan, along with their causes.
Udao vivaagaveyanamudoran appatti iha buvisasayam. Sataraas micche mos samm ahaar-jin'anuvaaya ||13||
Verse meaning - Experiencing the fruit at the time of Vipaka is called Uday, and experiencing the fruit even when the time of Vipaka is not present is called Udirana. There are 122 karma-prakritis that are generally eligible for Uday and Udirana. Among them, Misramohaniya, Samyaktva

Page #109:

## Second Karma Granth

The absence of the five natures - Mohaniya, Aharakadvik, and Tiyankaranama - allows for the emergence of 117 natures in the Mithyatva Gunasthan. Specifically, the experience of auspicious and inauspicious fruits of karmadalikas bound to the soul at their appointed time is called **Uday**, and the act of pulling the karmadalikas through special effort before their appointed time to experience their auspicious and inauspicious fruits is called **Udirana**.

Any karma, from the moment it is bound, begins its existence. The karmadalikas undergo a specific formation for the emergence of those karmas when their uninterrupted time is complete. The karma, residing in the karma udayavali, begins to bear fruit upon its emergence.

The experience of the auspicious and inauspicious fruits of karma is called **Uday** and **Udirana**. However, the difference between them is that **Uday** involves the experience of fruit in a natural order without effort, while **Udirana** involves the experience of fruit through effort, bringing the karma towards emergence before its appointed time.

In the context of calling the experience of karmavipak **Uday** and **Udirana**, **Raso-Uday** should be considered, but **Pradesho-Uday** should not be considered in **Udayadhikār**.

Each karma, at the time of its binding, develops the power to bear intense or mild fruit according to the three levels of intensity of the Kashayik Adhyavasaya that caused it. When the opportunity arises, it bears fruit accordingly. However, it should be understood that each fruit-bearing power, residing within the karma itself, bears fruit according to the nature of that karma, not according to the nature of other karmas. For example, Jnanavaranakarma...

Page #110:
---------------------------
## 74

The fruit-bearing power of karma gives intense or mild results according to the nature of the karma itself, and it only serves to cover knowledge. However, it does not give results according to the nature of other karmas like Darshanadaran, Vedaniya, etc. Similarly, one should understand the fruit-bearing power of other karmas.

The rule of giving results according to the nature of karma applies only to the **Mulaprakritis** (original natures), not to the **Uttarprakritis** (derived natures). Because, by the force of **Adhyavasaya** (determination), any karma can be transformed into another **Uttarprakriti** of the same karma. As a result, the previous fruit-bearing power gives intense or mild results according to the nature of the transformed **Uttarprakriti**. For example, when **Matijnanavarana** (covering of knowledge of the mind) is transformed into **Shrutajnanavarana** (covering of knowledge of scriptures) or other similar **Uttarprakritis**, the fruit-bearing power of **Matijnanavarana** acts according to the nature of **Shrutajnanavarana**, covering **Shrutajnana** (scriptural knowledge), **Avadhijnana** (clairvoyance), etc.

However, this rule does not apply to all **Uttarprakritis**. There are many **Uttarprakritis** that do not interconvert even if they are of the same type, such as **Darshanamoha** (delusion of perception) and **Charitramoha** (delusion of conduct). **Darshanamoha** does not transform into **Charitramoha**, and vice versa. Similarly, the four **Ayus** (life spans) of **Ayukarma** (karma of lifespan) do not interconvert into other **Ayus**.

Generally, there are 122 **Udayayogya Prakritis** (natures capable of arising) and 120 **Bandhayogya Prakritis** (natures capable of binding). Thus, there is a difference of two between **Udayayogya** and **Bandhayogya** **Prakritis**, which should not be. Because, as many **Prakritis** are bound, that many **Prakritis** should be considered **Udayayogya**. In that situation, it would be considered that one experiences the fruits of karma without **Karmabandha** (binding of karma), which is against the principle. The explanation for this is as follows:

Page #111:
---------------------------
## Second Karma Granth

The reason for stating 122 **udayayogya** (capable of arising) **prakritis** (nature) in comparison to 120 **bandhayogya** (capable of binding) **prakritis** is that **bandha** (binding) only occurs for **mithyatvamohaniya** (false belief-obscuring) **prakritis**. When **mithyatvamohaniya** **prakritis** become **ardha-vishuddha** (semi-pure) and **vishuddha** (pure) through the purity of **parinaamas** (results), they arise as **mishra-mohaniya** (mixed-obscuring) and **samyaktvamohaniya** (right belief-obscuring) **prakritis**.  Therefore, by combining these two with the 120 **bandhayogya** **prakritis**, the total number of **udayayogya** and **udiranayogya** (capable of arising and stimulating) **prakritis** becomes 122.

The 122 **udayayogya** and **udiranayogya** **karm-prakritis** (karma-natures) are as follows:

* **Jnanavaran** (knowledge-obscuring): 5
* **Darshanavaran** (perception-obscuring): 6
* **Vedaniya** (experiential): 2
* **Mohaniya** (obscuring): 28
* **Aayu** (life-span): 4
* **Naam** (name): 67
* **Gotra** (lineage): 2
* **Antaraya** (hindrance): 5

Therefore, 5 + 6 + 2 + 28 + 4 + 67 + 2 + 5 = 122.

Out of the 122 **udayayogya** **karm-prakritis**, the **mishra-mohaniya** **prakritis** arise in the third **gunasthan** (state of being), **samyaktvamohaniya** **prakritis** arise in the fourth **gunasthan**, **aaharaka-drik** (related to the **aaharaka** body and its parts) **prakritis** arise in the **pramatta** (distracted) **gunasthan**, and **tirthankara-naam** (name of a Tirthankara) **prakritis** arise in the thirteenth and fourteenth **gunasthan**.  Therefore, excluding these five **karm-prakritis**, the remaining 117 **prakritis** are considered to arise in the first **mithyatva** (false belief) **gunasthan**. In other words, 117 **prakritis** are **udayayogya** in the **mithyatva** **gunasthan** due to the non-arising of the aforementioned five **prakritis**.

Having explained the characteristics and general nature of **udaya** (arising) and **udirana** (stimulation), the number of **udayayogya** **prakritis**, their cause, the number of **udayayogya** **prakritis** in the first **gunasthan**, and their related causes, we will now discuss the number of **udayayogya** **prakritis** in the remaining six **gunasthanas** from the second **saasadan** (worldly) **gunasthan** to the seventh **aprammattavirat** (non-distracted, non-attached) **ganasthan**.

And in the sixth guna-sthana, by reducing the five natures of styana-dvitrika and aharaka-dvitrika, seventy-six natures emerge in the seventh apramattaviratguna-sthana.

**Special Note:** In these four verses, the number of natures that are capable of arising in the sasadan guna-sthana, samyagmiyyadristi (mithya) guna-sthana, aviratasamyagdristi guna-sthana, deshavirat guna-sthana, pramattasanyata guna-sthana, and apramattasanyata guna-sthana has been explained by the author.  _ In the first guna-sthana, out of the 117 natures that are capable of arising, the five natures of sukshmatrika - sukshmanamakarma, apariaptanama karma, sadharananama karma, and aatapanama karma, and mithyatvamohaneya - arise only due to mithyatva. But in the sasadan guna-sthana, due to the destruction of mithyatva, these five natures do not arise. _  Furthermore, the second point is that sukshmanamakarma arises in sukshma jivas, apariaptanama karma arises in apariapt jivas, and sadharananama karma arises in sadharan jivas. But neither sukshma, apariapt, nor sadharan jivas attain the sasadan guna-sthana, nor do they attain sasadanasamyaktva, and neither do sasadanasamyaktva-attaining jivas take birth in the sukshma, apariapt, or sadharan forms. In other words, sukshma, apariapt, and sadharan jivas are mithyatvi.

Page #114:
---------------------------
After the body's full development, the *ātapana karma* can arise in *bādar* earth-bodied beings, not before. But those beings who attain *sāsādan* right-belief and are born in the *bādar* earth-bodied form, vomit out the previously attained *sāsādan* right-belief before completing their body's development. This means that when *bādar* earth-bodied beings have the potential for *sāsādan* right-belief, the *ātapana karma* cannot arise, and when the *ātapana karma* can arise, *sāsādan* right-belief is not possible. For this reason, the *ātapana karma* is not considered to arise in the *sāsādan* state.

The arising of wrong-belief occurs only in the first wrong-belief state. It does not occur in the second, third, or any subsequent states. Therefore, at the end of the first wrong-belief state, the five natures, from subtle to wrong-belief, are severed, preventing their arising in the subsequent states.

Thus, out of the 117 natures that can arise in the first state, 112 should arise in the second state after the five natures, from subtle to wrong-belief, are diminished. However, a being who falls from *aupaśamika* right-belief and settles in the *sāsādan* state does not go to hell but attains wrong-belief. Therefore, since a being going to hell does not have the *sāsādan* state, the *narakanupūrvi* does not arise. The *narakanupūrvi* arises in beings who go to hell through the *vakragati* (devious path). But in that state, they...

## Second Karma Granth

**Living beings do not attain *Sāsāvadana Samyaktvā* and a living being who has attained *Sāsāvadana Samyaktvā* is not born in hell. Therefore, *Narkanupūrvi* does not arise in the *Sāsāvadana* Gunasthāna.**

Thus, at the end of the first Gunasthāna, the five subtle *Prakṛtis* (subtle, very subtle, extremely subtle, infinitely subtle, and infinitely infinitely subtle) and *Narkanupūrvi*, totaling six *Prakṛtis*, are eliminated from the 117 *Prakṛtis* that can arise in the first Gunasthāna. Therefore, 111 *Prakṛtis* are considered to arise in the second Gunasthāna.

Now, we will explain the number of *Prakṛtis* that can arise in the third Gunasthāna and the names of the *Bhātis* that rise at the end of the second Gunasthāna.

Out of the 111 *Prakṛtis* that can arise in the second Gunasthāna, the following nine *Prakṛtis* are eliminated at the end of the second Gunasthāna: *Anantānubandhi* (infinitely connected), *Kaṣāya Chatuṣka* (fourfold passions) - *Anantānubandhi* *Krodha* (anger), *Māna* (pride), *Māyā* (deceit), *Loba* (greed), and *Sthāvaranāma* (stationary name), *Ekendiriya Jāti* (one-sense being), and *Vikalendriya Trika* (three types of imperfect sense beings) - *Dwīndriya Jāti* (two-sense being), *Trīndriya Jāti* (three-sense being), and *Chaturindriya Jāti* (four-sense being).

This is because the *Anantānubandhi Kaṣāya Chatuṣka* arises only in the first and second Gunasthānas, and the *Sthāvaranāma Karma* and the *Ekendiriya Jāti*, *Dwīndriya Jāti*, *Trīndriya Jāti*, and *Chaturindriya Jāti* *Nāma Karma* arise only in the first and second Gunasthānas. They do not arise in the third or subsequent Gunasthānas. This is because the *Sthāvaranāma* and *Ekendiriya Jāti Nāma Karma* arise in one-sense beings, the *Dwīndriya Jāti Nāma Karma* arises in two-sense beings, the *Trīndriya Jāti Nāma Karma* arises in three-sense beings, and the *Chaturindriya Jāti Nāma Karma* arises in four-sense beings.

Karmastava,
The name arises for the four-sense beings and these beings have two Gunasthanas, the first or the second.
Therefore, the total nine types of Karma, from Anantanubandhi Krodha to Chaturindriya, are destroyed at the end of the second Gunasthana. And the 'Anuprthvinudaya', meaning the destruction of the hellish existence, takes place at the end of the first Gunasthana. The remaining three Anupurvis, namely, the Tich, the Manushya, and the Deva, are not considered as the arising types of the third Gunasthana because they are in the form of Anudaya in the third Gunasthana.
The Anupurvi Karma arises for the beings at the time when they move to take birth in the next existence. But the being in the third Gunasthana does not die and when there is a possibility of leaving the present body and taking the body of the next existence, then only the Anupurvi Karma can arise for the being in the third Gunasthana. Therefore, the Anupurvis are considered as Anudaya in the third Gunasthana.
Thus, the total nine types of Karma, from Anantanubandhi Krodha to Chaturindriya, and the three Anupurvis, namely, Tich, Manushya, and Deva, totaling twelve types, should be subtracted from the 111 types of Karma that are eligible to arise in the second Gunasthana. This would leave 66 types of Karma that should arise in the third Gunasthana. But the Misramohaniya Karma arises in the third Gunasthana, 'Mise Misodae', therefore, the said

## Second Karma Granth

In the third Gunasthan, the 66 Prakruti of Mishramohaniya Karma are combined, resulting in a total of 100 Prakruti.

In the final stage of the third Gunasthan, the Mishramohaniya Prakruti cease to exist. Therefore, in the fourth Gunasthan, the remaining 66 Prakruti, excluding Mishramohaniya, along with Samyaktva Mohaniya (Sammagapubvikheva) and the four Anupurvi (Naraka, Tiryanch, Manushya, and Deva Anupurvi) are capable of arising. Hence, there are 104 Prakruti capable of arising in the fourth Gunasthan.

Out of these 104 Prakruti, 17 Prakruti, namely Apratyakhyana Avarana Kshaya Chatushk, Manushya Anupurvi, Tiryanch Anupurvi, Kriyashtak, Dur Bhag Namkarma, Anadeya Namkarma, and Ayasha Kirti Namkarma, cease to exist at the end of the fourth Gunasthan. Therefore, these 17 Prakruti...

Therefore, when a Jiva with Avirat Samyagdristi goes through the Vigraha Gati to take a new body in the next life, the appropriate Anupurvi Namkarma arises from the four Anupurvi.

## 82

When the number of karmas is reduced from 104 in the fourth *guna-sthana* to 87 in the fifth *guna-sthana*, it is considered that the 87 karmas arise in the fifth *guna-sthana*.

The four *kṣayās* (attachments) of *apratyākhāṇa*, *āvaraṇa*, *kaṣāya*, and *caturṣka* arise until the fourth *guna-sthana*. As long as these four *kṣayās* arise, the beings cannot attain the *guna-sthānas* of *deśavirat* and beyond.

The fifth *guna-sthana* is possible for *tiryac* (animals), and the *guna-sthānas* from the fifth onwards are only possible for humans, not for gods or hell beings. Even humans can only attain these *guna-sthānas* after the age of eight, not before. Therefore, the *ānupūrvī* karma arises in the soul when it is about to take on a body related to *parabhāva* (the state of being a god or hell being) through *vakragati* (the path of karma). However, it is not possible for beings to attain the fifth or higher *guna-sthānas* at the time of the arising of any *ānupūrvī* karma. Therefore, it is considered that their *udayavicchedha* (cessation of arising) occurs at the end of the fourth *guna-sthana*.

The *ānupūrvīs* of hell beings and gods, these two *ānupūrvīs*, also do not arise in the fifth *guna-sthana*. These two are mentioned in the *gāthā* (verse) under the term "**viuvatt**" in the *vaikriṣa-aṣṭaka* (eight *vaikriṣa* karmas). The names and numbers of these eight karmas are as follows:

(1) *vaikriya-śarīra*, (2) *vaikriya-aṅgopāṅga*, (3) *devāyu*, (4) *devagati*, (5) *devānupūrvī*, (6) *narakāyu*, (7) *narakagati*, and (8) *narakānupūrvī*.

Of these eight karmas, *devāyu* and *devagati* arise in gods, and *narakāyu* and *narakagati* arise in hell beings. The *vaikriya-śarīra* and *vaikriya-aṅgopāṅga* karmas arise in both gods and hell beings. However, it has already been said that gods and hell beings do not have the fifth or higher *guna-sthānas*. And regarding the *ānupūrvīs*, it has also been explained...

Page #119:

## Second Karma Granth
### 83

It has already been stated that these (eight karmas) arise when a being takes a new body from the womb, and at that time, the five higher **guna sthana** (stages of spiritual development) are not present. Therefore, the eight karmas mentioned in the **vaikriya ashtak** (eight types of karmas) arise and cease at the end of the fourth **guna sthana**, and do not arise in the fifth **guna sthana**.

**Doubt:** Both humans and animals in the fifth **guna sthana**, upon attaining **vaikriya labdhi** (the ability to create a **vaikriya** body), can create a **vaikriya** body and **vaikriya** limbs. Similarly, a **muni** (ascetic) in the sixth **guna sthana** who has attained **vaikriya labdhi** can also create a **vaikriya** body and **vaikriya** limbs. At that time, both those humans in the sixth **guna sthana** and animals in the fifth **guna sthana** will definitely have the **vaikriya** body and **vaikriya** limbs **karma** arising. Therefore, the **vaikriya** body and **vaikriya** limbs **karma** should be counted among the karmas that can arise in the fifth and sixth **guna sthana**.

**Solution:** This discussion of arising karmas is in relation to gods and hell beings, who have the **vaikriya** body and **vaikriya** limbs **karma** arising throughout their lives. However, humans and animals may have these two karmas arising for a period of time, but not all humans and animals. Therefore, even though these two karmas can arise in the sixth **guna sthana** in relation to humans and the fifth **guna sthana** in relation to animals, they are not mentioned here.

In other words, humans and animals have a **uttarvaikriya** body (a body that arises from **guna**-based **pratyaya** (perception) and **labdhi** (attainment)), and this can also happen to those who are constantly in the **samyak tvī** (right faith) cycle, such as **chakravarti** (universal monarch). **Vishnu Kumar** and other **munis** also attained **labdhi** (attainment), and the sixth **karma granth** also mentions the arising of **vaikriya** in the requirements for **yoga**. However, here, the **uttarvaikriya** arising from **guna**-based **pratyaya** and **labdhi**...

Page #120:
---------------------------
The term "vaikriya" does not refer to the action itself, but rather to the "kriyadvik" (dual action) that is obtained from being born into that state (bhavapratyayik). This bhavapratyayik vaikriya body and the "pantr angopaang" named karma, are only found in gods and humans, but they do not have the fifth "gunasthan" (stage of spiritual development). Therefore, the emergence of "vaiyik" is not considered in the fifth gunasthan.

Similarly, the results of beings who attain the fifth and subsequent gunasthanas become so pure that the three types of karma - "dubhang" (defective), "anadeydvikanadeya" (unavoidable), and "ayashakirtinamkarma" (karma leading to bad reputation) - can only emerge in the first four gunasthanas, but not in the fifth and subsequent gunasthanas.

Therefore, 87 types of karma are capable of emerging in the fifth gunasthan.

In the sixth gunasthan, 81 types of karma are capable of emerging. Their explanation is as follows:

* Out of the 57 types of karma capable of emerging in the fifth gunasthan, the four types of karma - "tirigai au niujjoy" (karma leading to rebirth in the animal realm), "tiyanchagati" (karma leading to rebirth in the animal realm), "tiryachayu" (karma leading to a short lifespan in the animal realm), "nichgotra" (karma leading to a low birth in the animal realm), and "udyotanamkarma" (karma leading to brilliance) - are capable of emerging in the animal realm. And the animal realm can only have the fifth gunasthan, not the sixth or subsequent gunasthanas. Therefore, the emergence and cessation of these types of karma occurs at the end of the fifth gunasthan.

**Note:** The text mentions "jaidevuttaravikriya" (karma leading to the body of a god or a sage) and states that sages and gods possess the "uttaravikriya" body and that the "udyotanamkarma" emerges when they possess this body. Therefore, the emergence of "udyotanamkarma" is observed in the sixth gunasthan compared to those who possess the "vaikriya" body. Why is the emergence of "udyotanamkarma" considered only up to the fifth gunasthan? The answer is that the emergence of "udyotanamkarma" due to birth is considered, but not the emergence due to attainment.

Page #121:
---------------------------
## Second Karma Granth

These become extinct in time, meaning they are not capable of arising in the sixth and subsequent Gunasthanas. Thus, the arising of the four natures, namely Tiryanch-Gati, etc., up to Udyot, is considered to be only up to the fifth Gunasthana. And the arising of the fourfold Pratyakhyana-Avarana-Kshaya - Pratyakhyana-Avarana, Krodha, Mana, Maya, and Lobha - as long as it persists, the attainment of any Gunasthana from the sixth onwards does not occur. In other words, as long as the Pratyakhyana-Avarana Kshayas continue to arise, the observance of all restraints cannot be achieved, nor can the sixth Gunasthana be attained. Therefore, due to the cessation of these Kshayas at the end of the fifth Gunasthana, they are not considered capable of arising in the sixth Gunasthana.

Thus, out of the 87 natures capable of arising in the fifth Gunasthana, the arising of these eight natures - Tiryanch-Gati, Tiryanch-Ayu, Nich-Gotra, Udyot-Nama-Karma, and Pratyakhyana-Avarana Krodha, Mana, Maya, and Lobha - ceases at the end of the fifth Gunasthana. Therefore, it should be considered that the arising of the remaining 76 natures occurs in the sixth Gunasthana without these eight Karma-Prakritis. However, the arising of the two natures - Aharak-Dwik, Aharak-Sharira, and Aharak-Angopanga Nama-Karma - occurs only in the sixth Gunasthana. Therefore, by including these two in the aforementioned 76 natures, it is considered that the arising of a total of 81 natures occurs in the sixth Gunasthana.

The arising of Aharak-Dwik in the sixth Gunasthana is observed when a Chaturdasha Purvadhara Muni, through Labdhi, creates an Aharak-Sharira and assumes it. A Chaturdasha Purvadhari, through a subtle object...

When doubt arises in the mind and it is impossible to go to the field of the omniscient due to the absence of the omniscient nearby, they create a beautiful, flawless, and non-violent food body using their special attainment and go to the field of the omniscient with that body, resolve their doubts, and then return to their place.
But those fourteen former holders of the attainment are necessarily negligent. One who uses attainment becomes curious, and curiosity leads to a loss of stability or concentration. The loss of concentration is called negligence. Therefore, the food body is considered to arise in the sixth stage of the soul.
Out of the 81 natures that are capable of arising in the sixth stage of the soul, the five natures of *styanaddhitriknidra-nidra*, *prachala-prachala*, *styanaddhi*, and *aaharaka-dvik* do not arise from the seventh stage of the soul onwards. Because the arising of *styanaddhi* is in the form of negligence and

##  The Two Hundred Karma Granths

**Chapter 6:**

There is no negligence in the sixth *guna-sthana*. The arising of the *aaharaka-dvaya* happens only to those who are *pramatta-samyata*. Therefore, the arising and cessation of these five *prakritis* happens at the end of the sixth *guna-sthana*. This reduces the number of *prakritis* that can arise in the sixth *guna-sthana* from 81 to 76, which are then eligible to arise in the seventh *guna-sthana*.

**Chapter 7:**

Even though a *muni* may have an *aaharaka-sharira* after attaining pure *parinaama*, they can still pass through the seventh *guna-sthana*. The line is thin. This happens for a very short time, therefore the arising of the *aaharaka-dvaya* in the seventh *guna-sthana* is not counted. This is why the seventh *guna-sthana* is considered to have 76 *prakritis* that can arise.

After explaining the number of *prakritis* that can arise in each *guna-sthana* from the first to the seventh, and the names of the *prakritis* that cease to arise at the end of each *guna-sthana*, the following verses explain the arising of *karma-prakritis* in the eighth *guna-sthana* - *apuurva-karan*, up to the eleventh *guna-sthana* - *upashanta-kashaya-vitaraaga-dmastha*.

**Verse 18:**

*Sammatta-antima-sangha-ya-pati-yagacheo-bisatari-apuchve. Haasa-ichchaka-anto-chhashatthi-aniyatthi-veyatim*.

**Meaning:**

Due to the *mantra* of the three *samhananas* - *samyaktva-mohaniya* and the final two - the eighth *guna-sthana* - *apuurva-karan* has 72 *prakritis* that can arise. Of these, the cessation of the six *prakritis* - *haasya* etc. - leaves 66 *prakritis* that can arise in the ninth *guna-sthana* - *anivritti-baadara-samparaya*.

**Verse 16:**

*Sanjala-si-gam-chchheo-sathi-suhamam-mi-turiya-lobhanto. Uvasanta-gune-guna-sa-risana-araayagam-to*.

**Meaning:**

The tenth *guna-sthana* - *uvasanta* has 60 *prakritis* that can arise, and the eleventh *guna-sthana* - *guna-sa-risana-araayaga* has 4 *prakritis* that can arise.

**Karmastava**

The six categories of **trika** and **sanjvalanatika** are destroyed at the end of the ninth **anivrittibadasamparaya gunasthan**, leaving 60 categories eligible for arising in the tenth **sukshmasamparaya gunasthan**.  The destruction of **sanjvalnalobha** at the end of the tenth **gunasthan** leaves 56 categories eligible for arising in the eleventh **upshantamoha gunasthan**.  Of these 26 categories, **rishabhanaraachasanhanandvika** is destroyed at the end of the eleventh **gunasthan**.

**Special Note:** These two verses describe the number of categories eligible for arising in the eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh **gunasthanas**, and the names of the categories that are destroyed at the end of each.

Those who ascend the **gunasthan** series from the seventh **gunasthan** are **munis**.  A **muni** ascends the series when their **samyaktvamohaniyakarma** is either subdued or destroyed, not otherwise.  As long as **samyaktvamohaniyakarma** remains active, the series cannot be ascended.  A being who ascends the series by subduing **samyaktvamohaniyakarma** is called an **upshamsheni** and one who ascends by destroying it is called a **kshapaksheni**.

Therefore, of the 76 categories eligible for arising in the seventh **gunasthan**, **samyaktvamohaniyakarma** is destroyed at the end.  Only those beings with three **sanhananas** have the capacity to ascend the series, and the last three **sanhananas** are those of **mandavishuddhi** (slow purification) and they do not have the capacity to ascend the series.  Therefore, the last **sanhananatrika** - **ardhanaraachasanhanan**, **kolikasanhanan**, and **sevarta**...

**Sanhanan** ceases to arise at the end of the seventh **guna-sthana**. Therefore, in the eighth **guna-sthana**, 72 **prakritis** arise, as four **prakritis** from the 76 **prakritis** that were capable of arising in the seventh **guna-sthana** are eliminated.

As the **guna-sthana** progresses, the purity of the soul's **parinaamas** increases. Therefore, from the ninth **guna-sthana** onwards, the arising of **prakritis** in the form of **sanklishta parinaama** (**kaashayika**) becomes progressively less. Therefore, in the eighth **guna-sthana**, out of the 72 **prakritis** capable of arising, six **prakritis** - **haasya**, **rati**, **arati**, **shoka**, **bhaya**, and **jugupsa** - cease to arise at the end of the eighth **guna-sthana**, resulting in only 66 **prakritis** arising in the ninth **guna-sthana**.

Although 66 **prakritis** arise at the beginning of the ninth **guna-sthana**, the purity of the **parinaamas** continues to increase, causing the arising of six **prakritis** - **vedatrik** (**strived**, **purushaved**, and **napumsakaved**) and **sanjwalanakashayanik** (**sanjwalan krodha**, **maan**, and **maya**) - to cease in the ninth **guna-sthana** itself.

Therefore:

**Apamatte sammatam antimatiya sanhṛdi.**  **Gommatasar, Karmakaanda, 268**

2. The order of cessation of arising of the six **prakritis** like **vedatrik** in the ninth **guna-sthana** is as follows: If the series begins with a woman, she first ceases to arise in **strived**, then in **purushaved**, and then in **napumsakaved**. Subsequently, she gradually stops the arising of **sanjwalan-trik**. If the series begins with a man, he first ceases to arise in **purushaved**, then in **strived**, and then in **napumsakaved**, and gradually stops the arising of **sanjwalan-trik**. And if the one who begins the series is a **napumsak**, he first stops arising in **napumsakaved**, then in **strived**, then in **purushaved**, and gradually stops the arising of **sanjwalan-trik**.

**Karmastava**

Of the 66 Prakṛtis, 60 are capable of arising in the tenth Guṇasthāna, after the reduction of Vedatrik and Sanjvalana Kṣayika. Of these 60 Prakṛtis capable of arising in the tenth Guṇasthāna, the Sanjvalana Lobha arises and is extinguished at the end. Therefore, the remaining 56 Prakṛtis are found to arise in the eleventh Guṇasthāna after the reduction of Sanjvalana Lobha Kṣaya. Of these 56 Prakṛtis capable of arising, the two Sanhananas, Ṛṣabhanārāca Sanhanana and Nārāca Sanhanana, are extinguished at the end of the eleventh Guṇasthāna. This is because the Upaśama Śreṇī extends up to the eleventh Guṇasthāna, and those who ascend that Śreṇī can have all three Sanhananas; but the Kṣapaka Śreṇī only has the Vaja Ṛṣabhanārāca Sanhanana. Therefore, in the twelfth Guṇasthāna, there is only the Vaja Ṛṣabhanārāca Sanhanana, and the remaining Ṛṣabhanārāca Sanhanana and Nārāca Sanhanana are extinguished at the end of the eleventh Guṇasthāna.

After the eleventh Guṇasthāna, in the twelfth Kṣīṇakṣaya-Vītarāga-Chhadmastha Guṇasthāna, which is attained in sequence, the number of Prakṛtis capable of arising and the names of the Prakṛtis that are extinguished at the end, along with the number of Prakṛtis capable of arising in the thirteenth Sayogikechalī Guṇasthāna, are indicated in the following verse.

## Second Karma Granth

**Verse 20:**

"The Sagavan (knowledgeable) has understood the Buchami (the nature of karma) and the Niduganto (the nature of liberation). He has also understood the Panpaksha (the two extremes) and the Naanantaraayadansan-chad (the five knowledge-obscuring, five obstruction, and four vision-obscuring karmas). He is also aware of the Sajogi Baapala (the 42 karmas that are capable of arising in the state of Saayogi Kevali)."

**Verse Meaning:**

In the state of Ksheen Kshaya (diminished passions) and Beetarag (free from attachment), there are 57 karmas that can arise in the 57th Gunasthan (state of being). These 57 karmas are present until the Dvicharam (the two extremes) time. After the end of Nidradvik (the two karmas of sleep and activity), there are only 55 karmas that can arise in the final time. The five knowledge-obscuring, five obstruction, and four vision-obscuring karmas end at the final time of the 12th Gunasthan. In the Saayogi Kevali Gunasthan, there are 42 karmas that are capable of arising.

**Special Meaning:**

The verse explains the number of karmas that can arise at the beginning of the 12th Gunasthan and the names of the karmas that end. It also explains the number of karmas that can arise in the 13th Gunasthan.

It has been previously explained that the 12th Gunasthan is attained by those who ascend the Kshapak Shreni (the series of diminishing passions). Those who ascend the Kshapak Shreni are the Vajra Rishabha Naraach Sanhanan Dharis (those who possess the Vajra Rishabha Naraach Sanhanan and Naraach Sanhanan). Therefore, the two Sanhanans (Vajra Rishabha Naraach Sanhanan and Naraach Sanhanan) end at the final time of the 11th Gunasthan. When these two karmas are removed from the 56 karmas that can arise in the 11th Gunasthan, there are 54 karmas that can arise in the 12th Gunasthan. However, these 54 karmas are present only until the Dvicharam (the two extremes) time. At the final time, the Nidradvik (the two karmas of sleep and activity) cease to arise. Therefore, excluding these two karmas, there are 52 karmas that can arise in the final time of the 12th Gunasthan.

**Note:**

Some Acharyas (teachers) believe that the Nidra (sleep) karma arises in the Upamantmoha Gunasthan (the state of almost-free from delusion). However, because it is purified, it does not arise in the Ksheenmoha Gunasthan (the state of diminished delusion).

From the 55 categories mentioned, the five knowledge-obscuring categories - *matijnanaavaran*, *srutajnanaavaran*, *avadhijnanaavaran*, *manahparyayajnanaavaran*, and *kevalajnanaavaran*, and the five obstacles - *danantaraya*, *laabhantaraya*, *bhogantaraya*, *upabhogantaraya*, *viryantarya*, and the four vision-obscuring categories - *chakshudarshanaavaran*, *achakshudarshanaavaran*, *avhidarshanaavaran*, and *kevaladarshanaavaran*, totaling 14 categories, do not arise beyond the end of the twelfth *gunasthan*. Therefore, only 41 categories should be considered capable of arising in the *sayogikevali* *gunasthan*. However, the thirteenth *gunasthan* has the unique characteristic that the *tirthankaranamkarma*, which binds the beings who become *tirthankaras*, arises in this *gunasthan*. This *karma* does not arise in other *gunasthanas*. Therefore, by adding the *tirthankaranamkarma* to the previously mentioned 41 categories capable of arising, a total of 42 categories are considered to arise in the thirteenth *gunasthan*.

The number of categories capable of arising in the thirteenth *gunasthan* mentioned in the verse is indicated by the term "tityudaya" in the subsequent verse.

Now, in the subsequent verses, the categories that are destroyed in the thirteenth *gunasthan* and...

According to their opinion, all 55 categories already arise in the twelfth *gunasthan*. In the sixth *karmagrantha*, the *kshinamoha* *ganasthan* does not mention the arising of *nidra*. 1. Compare:

The second Karma Granth, in the fourteenth Gunasthan, details the number of उदययोग्य (udayoyogya)  natures and the names of those natures that cease to exist at their respective peak times.

**Verse 21:**
The उदययोग्य (udayoyogya) natures are six in number:  तित्थुदया (tiththudaya), उरला (urala), अपिरखगइदुग (apirakhgaiduga), परिसितिग (parisitiga), संठाणा (santhana), अगुरुलहुवन्नवल (agurulahuvannaval), निमिणतेयकम्माइसंघयण (niminateyakammaisanghayan).

**Verse 22:**
The second सूसर (susar) and सामासा (samasa) are eleven, and the तुच्छेओ (tuccheo) are thirty. The twelve are अजोगि (ajogi), सुभगाइज्जजसन्नयरवेयषियं (subhagaijjajasannayaraveyashiyam).

**Explanation:**
In the thirteenth Gunasthan, the उदरा (udara) of karma occurs.  Of the thirty उदययोग्य (udayoyogya) natures, including साता (sata) and असाता (asata) वेदनीय (vedaniya), one of them ceases to exist at the end of the thirteenth Gunasthan.  The remaining twenty-six are पुद्गलविपाकिनी (pudgalvipakinī).  

In the fourteenth Gunasthan, the उदय (udaya) of twelve natures, including सत्रिक (satrik), पंचेन्द्रियजाति (panchendriyajati), मनुष्यायु (manushyayu), मनुष्यगति (manushygati), जिननामकर्म (jinnamakarma), and उच्चगोत्र (uchchgotra), continues until the end of the fourteenth Gunasthan.  After this, they also cease to exist.

**Summary:**
These two verses describe the number of उदययोग्य (udayoyogya) natures in the thirteenth and fourteenth Gunasthan, and the names of those natures that cease to exist at their respective peak times.  In the thirteenth Gunasthan, forty-two उदययोग्य (udayoyogya) natures exist, of which thirty cease to exist at the end of the Gunasthan.  The remaining twenty-six are पुद्गलविपाकिनी (pudgalvipakinī).

Karmas are (those which cause the experience of vipāka by pudgala). Of these, the two natures called Susvara and Duḥsvara are Bhāṣā-pudgala-vipākinī, and the remaining 27 natures, such as Audārika-dvīka, etc., are Paśarīra-pudgala-vipākinī.

64
Tri-pākinī kṛtiyaṃ experience the fruit when there is harmony in yoga. Therefore, as long as the tendency of Vacana-yoga remains and the reception and transformation of Bhāṣā-pudgalas continues, the emergence of Susvara and Duḥsvara-nāmakarma is possible. And as long as the reception, transformation, and support of pudgalas is taken by Kāya-yoga, the emergence of the 27 natures, such as Audārika, etc., is possible. But at the peak time of the thirteenth guṇasthāna, yoga is suppressed. Therefore, the emergence of these 26 natures also stops at that time.

In the gāthā, some of these 26 natures have been given independent names, and the remaining natures have been indicated by designations. The names of the natures designated by designations are:

Audārika-ṭika, Audārika-śarīra, Audārika-aṅgopāṅga-nāmakarma. Asthira-dvīka, Asthira, Aśubha-nāmakarma.
Svargātida-dvīka - Śubha-vihāyoga-ti, Aśubha-vihāyoga-ti-nāmakarma. Pratyekatra-trika, Pratyek, Sthira, Śubha-nāmakarma.

—
—
Saṃsthāna-ṣaṭka - Sama-caturasra, Nyagrodha-parimaṇḍala, Sādi, Vāmana, Kubja, and Iṇḍa-saṃsthāna.

—
Aguru-laghu-catuṣka - Aguru-laghu, Upaghāta, Parāghāta, and Ucchvāsa-nāma.
Varṇa-catuṣka - Varṇa, Gandha, Rasa, Sparśa-nāma.

Through the above designations, the names of 23 natures have been told, and the names of the remaining six natures are as follows: Nir-māṇa, Taijasa-śarīra, Kārmaṇa.

## Second Karma Granth

**Body, Vajra-Rishabha-Naracha-Samhanana, Dusvara and Susvara names. These 23 + 6 total 26 Prakṛtis.**

Thus, the names of the 30 Prakṛtis that are to be extinguished at the end of the thirteenth Gunasthan are: Odarik-Sharira, Audarik Angopang, Asthir, Ashubh, Shubh Vihayogati, Ashubh Vihayogati, Sthir, Shubh, Sama-Chaturasra-Sansthan, Nyagrodha-Parimandala-Sansthan, Sadisansthan, Vaman-Sansthan, Kubja-Sansthan, Hund-Sansthan, Aguru-Lagghu, Upghāt, Parāghāt, Ucchvās, Varna, Gandha, Rasa, Sparsha, Nirman, Taijasa-Sharira, Karman-Sharira, Vajra-Rishabha-Naracha-Samhanana, Dusvara, Susvara, and one of the Vedaniya, either Mana or Amata.

Of the 42 Prakṛtis that are eligible to arise in the thirteenth Gunasthan, when these 30 Prakṛtis are subtracted, the remaining 12 Prakṛtis arise in the fourteenth Gunasthan. Their names are: Subhag, Aadey, Yash-Kirti-nam, one of the two Prakṛtis of Vedaniya Karma, Tras, Badar, Paryapt Pancha-Indriya-Jati, Manusya-Ayu, Manusya-Gati, Tirthankara-nam, and Uchcha-Gotra.

Kamstava
These 12 Prakṛtis remain in existence until the end of the fourteenth Guṇasthāna, and upon their cessation, the Jiva becomes free from Karma and attains the state of a perfect Siddha, reaching the abode of Moksha, the eternal and infinite bliss. And, "Svanubhutya Chakasate," it remains eternally illuminated by its own inherent knowledge.

Having thus described the rise and cessation of Karma Prakṛtis in the fourteen Guṇasthānas, we now proceed to describe the Udeeraṇā of Karmas in the Guṇasthānas in the following verses.

Udau-Khudeeraṇā Parampamasaisaigaganeṣu ||23|| Esa Paryāḍ-Tigūṇā Beyaryāmadahārajugat Taulati-g. Maṇuyāu Pamattanta Ajogi Aṇudiirgo Bhagavan ||24||

Gāthārtha - Udeeraṇā is similar to Uday. However, there is a difference between Uday and Udeeraṇā in the seven Guṇasthānas starting from Apramāta. Udeeraṇā is less in the three Prakṛtis. Vedaniya-drik, Āhārak-dvik, Styāna-dvitrik, and Maṇuṣyāyu, these eight end in the Pramāta Guṇasthāna, and the Ayogik-kevala Bhagavan does not experience the Udeeraṇā of any Karma.

Viśeṣārtha - The verse explains the similarity and difference in the number of Uday and Udeeraṇā Prakṛtis up to which Guṇasthāna, and from which Guṇasthāna onwards. It also clarifies the difference with reasons. 1. The extraordinary cause of Moksha, the Punyodaya-ātmaka Prakṛtis, generally remain in Uday until the fourteenth Guṇasthāna, hence the state of Samsara is considered up to that point. Afterwards, the state of Siddha is attained, meaning that not a single Karma remains in Uday or existence. Even in existence, these 12 Prakṛtis are generally considered in the fourteenth Guṇasthāna.

Page #133:
---------------------------
In the fourteenth Aayogikevali Gunasthan of the second Karmagrantha, it is clearly stated that just as there is no arising of Karma-prakritis, there is also an absence of the arising of Karmas.

Although the arising of prakritis and their udirana (arising) are the same in the Gunasthanas, this rule should be understood from the first Mithyatva Gunasthan to the sixth Pramatta-Samyatta Gunasthan. From the seventh Apratmatta-Samyatta Gunasthan to the thirteenth Sayogikevali Gunasthan, there is a special characteristic in the udirana compared to the arising of Karma-prakritis in these seven Gunasthanas.

The reason for this special characteristic is that in the sixth Gunasthan, 81 udayayogya (capable of arising) prakritis are mentioned, and at its final stage, the five prakritis of Aharak-dvik-Aharak-sharira and Aharak-angopanga, and Styaddhitrik-nidra-nidra, Prachala-prachala, and Styanaddhi are severed. However, besides these five prakritis, the udirana-vichched (severance of arising) of the three prakritis of Vedaniyadvik-sata, Asata Vedaniya, and Manushayayu also occurs. Beyond the sixth Gunasthan, there are no such adhyavasayas (determinations) that can cause the udirana of these three prakritis. Therefore, from the seventh to the thirteenth Gunasthan, the three udiranayogya (capable of arising) prakritis are considered less than the udayayogya prakritis.

The meaning of the above statement is that from the first to the sixth Gunasthan, the number of udayayogya and udiranayogya prakritis is the same in each Gunasthan. However,

1. These three prakritis arise only from the Sanklishta parinamas (complex results), therefore, it is impossible for these three to arise in the Apratmattadi Gunasthanas.

Page #134:
---------------------------
68
From the seventh to the thirteenth **guna-sthana**, in each **guna-sthana**, there are three **prakriti**s that are capable of arising. Therefore, the number of **prakriti**s that are capable of arising and those that are capable of being destroyed in the **guna-sthana**s should be understood as follows:

**Guna-sthana Order** | **Number of Arising Prakriti** | **Number of Destroyed Prakriti**
------- | -------- | --------
1 | 117 | 117

The twelfth **guna-sthana** has 57 **prakriti**s that are capable of arising, and their arising is considered to be until the **dvi-charam** time. Therefore, subtracting **nidra-dvi** from the aforementioned 57 **prakriti**s leaves 55 **prakriti**s that are capable of arising. Therefore, subtracting **vedaniya-dvi** and **manushya-ayu** from the 57 **prakriti**s that are capable of arising before the **dvi-charam** time leaves 54 **prakriti**s that are capable of being destroyed. And subtracting the aforementioned three from the 55 **prakriti**s that are capable of arising at the final time leaves...

Page #135:
---------------------------
## Second Chapter

**££**

When reducing the number of **Prakritis**, 52 **Prakritis** remain **Udeernayogya**. Therefore, in the twelfth **Gunasthan**, 57 and 55 **Prakritis** are **Udayayogya** and 54 and 52 **Prakritis** are **Udeernayogya**, respectively.

The **Udeerna** of **Karma-Prakritis** should be understood only up to the thirteenth **Gunasthan**. In the fourteenth **Gunasthan**, the **Sayogiketal** **Gunasthan**, there is no **Udeerna** of any **Karma**. The reason for the absence of **Udeerna** in this **Gunasthan** is that **Udeerna** requires **Yoga**, but in the fourteenth **Gunasthan**, **Yoga** is completely **Nirodha**. Therefore, there is no **Udeerna** of **Karmas** in this **Gunasthan**.

Thus, having described the **Udeerna** of **Karmas** in fourteen **Gunasthanas**, we now explain the characteristics of the existence of **Karmas** and how many **Karma-Prakritis** exist in each **Gunasthan** in the following verses.

**Satta** is the state of being, the existence of **Karma** that has been bound by **Bandha** and has attained its own nature. From the beginning to the end, there are 148 **Prakritis** that exist, but in the second and third **Gunasthanas**, only 147 **Prakritis** exist, excluding the **Jinnamakarma**.

**Attached to the soul**
**Eleventh Gunasthan**

**Special Note:** The verse describes the characteristics of **Satta** and the number of **Satta-Prakritis** from the beginning to the eleventh **Gunasthan**. It also hints at the absence of **Tirthankura-Namakarma** in the second and third **Gunasthanas**.

##  Praise
 
'Bandhai - Laddha-Attalabhanam' -  The attainment of the Self (Atma) is achieved through Bandha (bondage) and other factors.  'Bandhadi Labdhatma - Labhanam - 'Kamman - Karmana' - The state of existence of the Karma (action) atoms, their position, harmony, presence, and being is called 'Thii-Sthitih' (state). Here, the word 'Bandha Adi' (bondage and others) includes 'Adi' (others) which implies 'Samkranam' (transition) and other factors.  In other words, the Karma Pudgalas (action particles) that transform into a specific Karma form at the time of Bandha, remain attached to the Atma in that same Karma form. Similarly, these same Karma Pudgalas, leaving their previous form, transform into another Karma form and remain attached to the Atma. This state of existence is called 'Satta' (being).  The first type of Satta is called 'Bandha Satta' (bondage being) and the second type is called 'Samkranam Satta' (transition being).

-
-

When the Pudgalaskandha (particle aggregate) becomes associated with the Atma due to Mithyatva (false belief) and other causes, it is then called 'Karma'. From that point onwards, the existence of that Karma is considered. For example, when the bondage of Narakagati (hell) occurs and it arises in the Udya (emergence) and remains until its Nirjara (destruction), the existence of the Narakagati Karma is considered. This is because the Karma Pudgalas have attained their form as Narakagati Karma through Bandha.

Perhaps, the Narakagati Karma may transition into the Tiyachgati Karma (animal realm). In this case, the Narakagati Karma, which had attained its form through Bandha, undergoes a transition into the Tiyachgati Karma.  The Tiyachgati Karma attains its form through this transition and its existence continues. However, the existence of the Narakagati Karma, which originated from Bandha, is discontinued due to the transition. Similarly, the existence of Mithyatva (false belief) occurs in Bandha, and the existence of Samyaktava (right belief) and Mohaniya (delusion) and Misra Moh (mixed delusion) occurs in Samkranam (transition).

Page #137:
---------------------------
## Second Karma Granth
### 101

The existence of niy is new due to the state of mithyatva and the refraction of rasa, and it is mutual due to being mutually connected.

There are two types of existence: sadbhavasatta and sambhavasatta. The existence that is considered due to the possibility of the existence of many natures in the future, even though they do not exist at a particular time, is called sambhavasatta. And the existence of those natures that exist at that time is called sadbhavasatta (swaroopasatta).

For example, the upshama श्रेणी does not include the existence of narakayu and tiryanchayu. However, 148 natures are considered to exist in the eleventh gunasthan. The reason for this is that if devayu or manushyayu is bound before, then its sadbhavasatta will be considered. But the sadbhavasatta of the said narak and tiryanch - these two ayus will not be considered. But if one falls from the eleventh gunasthan and binds those two ayus later, then it is called sambhavasatta in that expectation.

There are also two types of sambhavasatta and sadbhavasatta: purvavaddhayu and avaddhayu. And in them too, there are many different considerations based on the expectation of many different jivas, the expectation of one jiva, and the basis of upshama श्रेणी, kshapaka श्रेणी. And in these श्रेणियों, there are also considerations based on the support of anantanubandhi visanayajak and avisanayajak, and the support of kshayik, kshayopashamic, and aupashamic samyaktva.

The one who performs visanayana is called visanayajak. 'Darshan Saptak 1. The destruction of the anantanubandhi chatushk, but being in the state of mohavik satta, is called visanayana.

Page #138:
---------------------------
When the four *anantaanubandhi* karmas in the seven *prakritis* are destroyed, but the remaining three *prakritis* are not destroyed, meaning that the *mithyatvamohaniya* karma remains in existence and can manifest, then there is still the possibility of the binding of the four *anantaanubandhi* *kṣayās*. This type of destruction is called *visan-yojana*. When the destruction is such that there is no possibility of binding of that *prakriti* again, it is called *kṣaya*.

There are 148 *karma* *prakritis* that can exist. They are:

(1) *Jñānāvaraṇa* (5), (2) *Darśanāvaraṇa* (6), (3) *Vedaniya* (2), (4) *Mohaniya* (28), (5) *Āyu* (4), (6) *Nāma* (63), (7) *Gotra* (2), (8) *Antarāya* (5).

Adding these together, we get 5 + 3 + 2 + 28 + 4 + 63 + 2 + 5 = 148.

Although 122 *prakritis* are said to be capable of manifestation, the reason for saying that 148 *prakritis* exist is that in the case of manifestation, the five *bandhanas* and five *saṅghātanas* are not considered separately, but their five *prakritis* are included in the five *śarīranāmakarma*. Similarly, at the time of manifestation, the *varna*, *gandha*, *rasa*, and *sparśa* *nāmakarma* were considered as one *prakriti* each. However, in the case of existence, the *varna*, *gandha*, *rasa*, and *sparśa* *nāmakarma* are considered to have five, two, five, and eight divisions respectively.

In this way, the 122 *prakritis* that are capable of manifestation, instead of the five divisions of *bandhananāmakarma* and *saṅghātananāmakarma* and the four general divisions of *varna*, *gandha*, *rasa*, and *sparśa*, are combined with their aforementioned twenty divisions. 1. *Varna* - *kṛṣṇa*, *nīla*, *loha*, *hāridra*, *śukla* | *Gandha* - *surabhi*, *durabhi* | *Rasa* -

Page #139:
---------------------------
According to the *Vishiya Karmagrantha*, there are a total of 148 *prakritis* (natures) considered capable of existence. The nature of these *karma-prakritis* should be understood from the *Karmagrantha*.

Generally, there are 148 *prakritis* capable of existence. From the first *mithyatva* *gunasthan* (stage of virtue) to the eleventh *upshantakashaya* *gunasthan*, excluding the second *sasadan* and third *mitra* *gunasthan*, the existence of 148 *prakritis* is stated in the remaining nine *gunasthanas*. This statement should be understood in terms of potential. Because, at any given time, a living being cannot have more than two *ayus* (life spans) - one being experienced and the other being bound. However, all *karmas* have the potential to be bound, which means that when the material for binding is available, even those *karmas* that are not currently present can be bound and exist. In other words, even if a *karma* does not have actual existence in the present, it is considered capable of existence due to the possibility of its potential to be bound in the future.

**Doubt:** In the 158 *uttaraprakritis* (secondary natures) of the eight *karmas*, 103 *prakritis* of *namakarma* (name-karma) have been mentioned earlier. Here, in the 148 *prakritis* capable of existence, 13 *prakritis* of *namakarma* are included.

**Resolution:** The reason for taking 63 divisions of *namakarma* here is that, similar to *sharira-namakarma* (body-name-karma), five divisions of *bandhana-namakarma* (binding-name-karma) are also taken:

* *Tikta* (bitter), *katu* (pungent), *kashaya* (astringent), *amla* (sour), *madhura* (sweet).
* *Sparsha* (touch): *karkasha* (rough), *mridu* (soft), *laghu* (light), *guru* (heavy), *sheet* (cold), *ushna* (hot), *snigdha* (unctuous), *ruksha* (dry).
* *Bandhana* (binding), *sanghatana* (combination), and *varna-chaturshka* (four colors) - these are all *prakritis* of *namakarma*. Therefore, to refer to their full names, the word "namakarma" should be added to each of them.

There are 15 types of **Name Karma** (karma related to name and form). When these 15 types are considered instead of the 5 subtle ones, there are 103 types of **Name Karma**. Then, there will be 158 **Karma Pratikrti** (types of karma) considered as capable of existence.

**Doubt:** In the **Mithyatva** (false belief) **Gunasthan** (stage of spiritual development), the existence of **Tirthankara Name Karma** should not be considered. Because only a **Subhyati** (a being who has attained the highest state of spiritual development) can become a **Tirthankara**. Therefore, how can the existence of **Tirthankara Name Karma** be considered when a **Mithyatvi** (a being in the state of false belief) cannot bind this karma?

**Solution:** A being who has previously bound **Narakayu** (hellish existence) in the **Mithyatva Gunasthan** and later attained **Kshayopaśamika Samyaktv** (perfect knowledge and conduct) and bound **Tirthankara Name Karma**, will inevitably abandon **Samyaktv** and attain **Mithyatva** when going to hell. It is with respect to such a being that the existence of **Tirthankara Name Karma** is considered in the first **Gunasthan**. In other words, if a human being has bound **Narakayu** in the **Mithyatva Gunasthan** in the past and later attained **Kshayopaśamika Samyaktv** and bound **Tirthankara Name Karma**, then that being will vomit **Samyaktv** and go to hell upon death, and attain **Samyaktv** again there. Until the moment of death, **Mithyatva** remains. Therefore, the existence of **Tirthankara Name Karma** is considered there. This is why 148 **Pratikrti** are considered to exist in the **Mithyatva Gunasthan**.

No being can bind **Tirthankara Name Karma** in the second and third **Gunasthan**. Because **Shuddha Samyaktv** (pure perfect knowledge and conduct) is not present in these two **Gunasthan**, **Tirthankara Name Karma** cannot be bound. Similarly, no being can bind **Tirthankara Name Karma** and then fall from **Samyaktv** and attain the second or third **Gunasthan**.

## Second Karma Granth 105

Therefore, in the second and third Gunasthanas, except for the Tirthankara-nama karma, there can be the existence of 147 Prakṛtis.

**Doubt:** The Upshama श्रेणी does not bind to Naraka and Tiryanchayu, and without binding and arising, there is no existence of Ayukarma. Also, in the sixth Karma Granth, Ayukarma has been explained, and there, in the 10th and 11th Gunasthanas, the existence of Naraka and Tiryanchayu is not mentioned. Then how can the existence of 148 Prakṛtis be considered until the eleventh Gunasthana?

**Solution:** Although the existence of Naraka and Tiryanchayu does not decrease in the श्रेणी, still, a being can be expelled from the Upshama श्रेणी and touch all four gatis. Therefore, from the perspective of possible existence, here, Naraka and Vayu are not considered. The existence of 148 Prakṛtis is possible for those who have not destroyed Darshan, Moh, and Tak, and who have uninterrupted Samyagdristi, etc.

Thus, after defining existence and generally mentioning the Prakṛtis that are capable of existing from the first to the eleventh Gunasthana, in the following verses, the existence of Prakṛtis in the fourth and subsequent Gunasthanas is described in a different way.

**Verse 26:**

**Meaning:** In the four Gunasthanas of Apurva, etc., except for the six Prakṛtis of Ananta-anubandhi-chatushk, Naraka, and Tiryanchayu, if the sevenfold (Saptak) has been destroyed, then in the four Gunasthanas of Avirat Samyagdristi, etc., there is the existence of 141 Prakṛtis.

Page #142:
---------------------------
**Karmastava**

**Special Meaning:** Although the previous verse states that there are 148 karmic substances in the first eleven gunasthanas, excluding the second and third gunasthanas, and 147 karmic substances in the second and third gunasthanas, this statement is correct in comparison to the general case. However, as the determination of present-day beings becomes purer from the fourth gunastana onwards, the number of karmic substances decreases. Keeping this in mind, we explain the number of karmic substances from the fourth gunastana onwards.

The principle of Panchasangraha is that a being who disconnects the four ananta-anubandhi kshayas and does not bind the hell and tithyancha ayus, begins the upshama श्रेणी. In other words, a being who disconnects the four ananta-anubandhi kshayas and binds the deva-ayu, entering the upshama श्रेणी, has 142 karmic substances in the eighth and subsequent four gunasthanas.

Those who have destroyed the seven karmic substances, namely the four ananta-anubandhi kshayas and the darshan-mohaniya trika, have 141 karmic substances in the four gunasthanas from the fourth to the seventh. This number of 141 karmic substances should be understood in relation to the kshayik samyaktvi who are without श्रेणी, and also in relation to those who are kshayik samyaktvi but not charma-shariri, but who still have to take rebirth for liberation. However, those who are charma-shariri kshayik samyaktvi have neither the essence nor the possibility of any other life besides the human life.

## Second Karma-pranya 107

The summary is that for non-category-classifying, *kshayika* *sanyastri* beings, there are 141 *prakritis* in the four *gunasthanas* from the fourth to the seventh. This statement is in relation to many beings, and even for those who are *kshadhika* *samyaktvī* but not *charmasarīrī*, there are also 141 *prakritis* in the four *gunasthanas* from the fourth to the seventh.

The *upshama* category is considered from the eighth to the eleventh *gunasthanas*, encompassing four *gunasthanas*. In other words, these four *gunasthanas* belong to the *upshama* category, which arises from the disassociation of the four *anantaanubandhi* *kṣayās* and does not bind to hell or animal realms, only to the realm of gods. Therefore, out of the 148 *prakritis* that are generally possible, subtracting the six *prakritis* of the four *anantaanubandhi* *kṣayās* and hell and animal realms, 142 *prakritis* are considered to exist for beings classified in the *upshama* category from the eighth to the eleventh *gunasthanas*, encompassing four *gunasthanas*.

Thus, having described the *prakritis* that exist generally from the fourth to the *upshama* category *gunasthanas*, we now proceed to describe the existence of karmas in relation to the *kṣapaka* category in the following verse.

**Verse 27:**

*Lakṣaṇam tu pappa cau-su di pamyāla narayati-risu-rāja viṇā | Sat-taga viśu aḍatī-saṁ jā aniyatṭī paḍama-bhāgo ||27||*

**Meaning:** In relation to *kṣapaka* beings, there are 145 *prakritis* in the four *gunasthanas*, excluding hell, animal, and god realms, and 138 *prakritis* excluding the *saptaka* until the time of the *aniyatṭī* *paḍama-bhāgo* (the first stage of the *aniyatṭī* *gunasthanas*).

Page #144:
---------------------------
**Karmastada**

In the previous verse, the existence of karma-types was explained in relation to the Upashama category. Now, in this verse, the existence of karma-types is explained in relation to the Kshapaka category.

**10**

Those beings who are destined to turn towards the Kshapaka category in their present life and are Charamasheeri (those who will attain liberation in this very life), i.e., those who are currently either Aupashmika or Kshayopa-shmika Samyaktvi, but are destined to turn towards the Kshapaka category and attain liberation in this very life, they only have the existence of the Manushya-ayu (human lifespan). The existence of the other three Ayus (lifespans) is not there, nor is their possibility. Therefore, in relation to such Kshapaka beings, from the fourth to the seventh Gunasthan (spiritual stages), there are 145 karma-types that exist out of the 148 karma-types that are capable of existing, as the Naraka-ayu (hellish lifespan), Tiyancha-ayu (heavenly lifespan), and Deva-ayu (divine lifespan) are not possible for them.

However, those beings who have attained Kshayika Samyaktva (complete liberation) by destroying the Ananta-anubandhi-chatushk (four infinite karmas) and Darshan-moha-trik (three karmas related to perception and delusion), and who will not have another birth after this one, such beings, from the fourth Gunasthan onwards, become Kshayika Samyaktvi and turn towards the Kshapaka category. In relation to such beings, due to the destruction of the Ananta-anubandhi-chatushk and Darshan-moha-trik, which are seven karma-types, and the non-existence of the remaining three Ayus except the present Manushya-ayu, 138 karma-types are considered to exist out of the 148 karma-types that are capable of existing. This existence of 138 karma-types should be understood from the fourth Gunasthan to the first part of the ninth Gunasthan.

But those beings who cannot turn towards the Kshapaka category in their present life, i.e., those who are Acharamasheeri (those who will not attain liberation in this life), among them, some are Kshayika Samyaktvi, some are Aupashmika Samyaktvi, and some are Kshayopa-shmika Samyaktvi.

Page #145:
---------------------------
## Second Karma Granth

In the 25th verse, the existence of 148 karmic natures should be understood in relation to the *Kshayopaamik Samyaktvī* and *Aupashmik Samyavtvī* *Acharamasharīrī*. And in the 26th verse, the existence of 141 karmic natures should be understood in relation to the *Kshayik Samyaktvī* *Acharamasharīrī*. Because, although any *Acharamasharīrī* being does not simultaneously possess the existence of all karmic natures, it is possible for them to exist, therefore, they are considered to possess the existence of all karmic natures.

In summary, 148 karmic natures are capable of existing in general. In the second and third *Gunasthanas*, the existence of 147 karmic natures is considered due to the absence of the *Tirthaksharanama Karma*. However, the existence of 148 karmic natures mentioned from the first to the eleventh *Gunasthanas* is considered due to the possibility of their existence. This is because, a being who has attained the eleventh *Gunasthanas* can fall back to the first *Gunasthanas* and can experience all the *Gunasthanas* in the same order they ascended. Therefore, even though the existence of karmic natures may be present according to the current *Gunasthanas*, the possibility of the existence of the remaining karmic natures is considered, and hence, 148 karmic natures are considered to exist.

However, the fourth *Gunasthanas* is called *Avirat Samyagdristi*. There are three types of *Samyagdristi*: *Upashma Samyagdristi*, *Kshayopaamik Samyagdristi*, and *Kshayik Samyagdristi*. Those who have attained *Samyakdristi* by subduing the *Mohaniya Karma* that hinders *Samyaktvī* are called *Upashma Samyagdristi*. And those who have attained *Samyaktvī* by destroying the *Kshayoyogya* karmic natures from the *Mohaniya Karma* and subduing the remaining karmic natures are called *Kshayopaamik Samyagdristi*.

Page #146:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**110**

Karma is obtained, and the type of liberated being who has obtained such karma is called a *Kshayopaamik Samyagdrsti*. Those who have obtained liberation by completely destroying the nature of the *mohaniya* karma that obstructs liberation are called *Kshayik Samyagdrsti*. 

Of these three types of liberated beings, the *Upshama* and *Kshayopaamik Samyagdrsti* belong to the *Upshama* category, while the *Kshayik Samyagdrsti* belong to the *Kshapa* category. Those beings who are destined to attain the *Kshapa* category will attain liberation by destroying all karma. However, this is not possible for beings in the *Upshama* category. Therefore, their downfall is possible. The order of the categories begins from the eighth *Gunasthan*.

However, those beings who have not yet attained any category and are currently in the fourth to seventh *Gunasthan*, if they are *Samyagdrsti* and are not destined to attain liberation in this very life, then due to the destruction of the *Anantanubandhi Chatushk* and the *Darshanmohaniya* group of seven natures, their existence is considered to be 141 natures from the fourth to the seventh *Gunasthan*. Because it is possible for any *Acharamshariri* being to exist in all lifetimes, even if they do not exist simultaneously, their existence is considered to be in all lifetimes. Therefore, the existence of a *Kshayik Samyagdrsti* being is considered to be 141 natures in the four *Gunasthan* from the fourth to the seventh.

Those beings who can attain the *Kshapa* category in the present time and are *Charamshariri*, but have not yet destroyed the *Anantanubandhi Chatushk* and *Darshanmohaniya*, their existence is considered to be 145 natures. And those who have destroyed the aforementioned *Anantanubandhi Chatushk* and the seven natures, their existence is considered to be 138 natures.

Page #147:
---------------------------
## Second Karma Granth

And this existence is found up to the first part of the ninth Gunasthan. But those beings who cannot attain the Kshapaka श्रेणी in the present birth, that is, the Acharam Shariri, some of them are also Kshayik Samyaktvi, and some are also Aupashmik Samyaktvi, and some are also Kshayopa-samyaktvi. Among these, the existence of Kshayopa-samyaktvi and Aupashmik Samyaktvi Acharam Shariri beings is considered to be 148 in number.

**111**

Out of these 148 types, those beings who are about to begin the Upshama श्रेणी, and the principle for beginning the Upshama श्रेणी is that whoever disconnects the Ananta-anubandhi Pay Chatushk and does not have bondage to Naraka and Tiryanch Ayus, can begin the Upshama श्रेणी. So, according to the principle, from the eighth to the eleventh Gunasthan, there are four Gunasthanas, and in these four Gunasthanas, there are 142 types of existence of Ananta-anubandhi Kashay Chatushk, Naraka Ayus, and Tiryanch Ayus - these six types.

Thus, the existence of Karmas of beings who have the Kshapaka श्रेणी, which is the cause of Moksha, has been explained up to the first part of the ninth Gunasthan. There are nine parts of the ninth Gunasthan. Therefore, in the next two verses, the existence of types in the eight parts from the second to the ninth part of the ninth Gunasthan is to be explained.

The destruction of the sixteen karmas, namely, *sthāna-dvaya*, *tiyancha-dvaya*, *naraka-dvaya*, *ātapa-hika*, *sthāna-dvaya*, *eka-indriya-jāti*, *vikala-indriya-trika*, and *sādhāraṇa-nāma-karma*, at the end of the first part of the ninth *guṇa-sthāna* leaves one hundred and twenty-two karmas in the second part. Of these one hundred and twenty-two karmas, the destruction of the eight karmas, namely, *apratyākhāyana-āvaraṇa-kaṣāya-caturṣka* and *pratyākhāyana-āvaraṇa-kaṣāya-caturṣka*, at the end of the second part leaves one hundred and fourteen karmas in the third part. Subsequently, the destruction of *napumsaka-veda*, *strī-veda*, *hāsyādi-ṣaṭka*, *puruṣa-veda*, *sanjvalana-krodha*, *māna*, and *māyā* in the third to ninth parts respectively leaves one hundred and thirteen, twelve, six, five, four, and three karmas.

**Special Note:** The ninth *guṇa-sthāna* has nine parts. The first part has one hundred and thirty-eight karmas, as mentioned in the previous verse. These verses describe the names of the karmas that are destroyed in the remaining eight parts of the *guṇa-sthāna* from the second to the ninth, and the number of karmas remaining in each part.

The one hundred and thirty-eight karmas mentioned in the first part are reduced to one hundred and twenty-two in the second part after the destruction of the sixteen karmas, namely, *sthāvara-dvaya*, *tiyancha-dvaya*, *naraka-dvaya*, *ātapa-hika*, *sthāna-dvaya*, *eka-indriya-jāti*, *vikala-indriya-trika*, and *sādhāraṇa-nāma*.

The one hundred and twenty-two karmas in the second part are reduced to one hundred and fourteen in the third part after the destruction of the eight karmas, namely, *apratyākhāyana-āvaraṇa-kaṣāya-caturṣka* and *pratyākhāyana-āvaraṇa-kaṣāya-caturṣka*.

Page #149:
---------------------------
## Second Karma Granth 
113

The existence of the 114 karmas in the third part remains after the destruction of the 114 karmas in the last time of the second part. And after the destruction of the Nupunsakaved in the last time of the third part, the existence of 113 karmas remains in the fourth part. And out of these 113 karmas, the destruction of Strived in the last time of the fourth part leaves 112 karmas in the fifth part. And after the destruction of Hasya Patak in the last time of the fifth part, the existence of 106 karmas remains in the sixth part. 

In the sixth part, out of the 106 karmas that are capable of existence, the absence of Purushaved in the last time of the sixth part leaves 105 karmas in the seventh part. And out of the 105 karmas that are considered incapable of existence in the seventh part, the destruction of Sanjwalan Krodh in the last time of the seventh part leaves 104 karmas in the eighth part. 

And out of the 104 karmas that are capable of existence in the eighth part, the destruction of Sanjwalan Man in the last time of the eighth part leaves 103 karmas in the ninth part. 

Thus, the existence of 103 karmas remains in the last part - the ninth part - of the Nivva Gunasthan. And in the last time of this last part - the ninth part - the destruction of Sanjwalan Maya also takes place. After the destruction of Maya, the remaining 102 karmas remain capable of existence in the tenth Gunasthan. This will be discussed in the following verses.

It is a general rule that in the absence of the cause, the effect also does not remain. Therefore, the main causes of the bondage, arising, and existence of the karmas that were destroyed in the previous Gunasthanas are Mithyatva, Aviriti, and Kashaya. Compared to the previous Gunasthanas, the causes like Mithyatva etc. are absent in the subsequent Gunasthanas. Therefore, if these causes like Mithyatva etc. are no longer present, then their existence...

Page #150:
---------------------------
Even the karmas that reside in the state of bondage, arising, and being, do not remain. They are destroyed.

Thus, after stating the nature of existence in the ninth stage of spiritual progress, the following verse describes the number of existing natures in the tenth and twelfth stages, and the names of the natures that are destroyed at their end.

**Verse 30:**

**Meaning:** (With the destruction of the Sanjvalana Maya at the end of the ninth stage of spiritual progress), there are 102 natures existing in the Sukhsamprayaya stage. And at the end of this stage, with the destruction of Sanjvalana Lobha, there are 101 natures existing until the second extreme time in the Kshinamoha stage. And with the destruction of Nidradvik, there are 6 natures existing in the final time. And in the final time, the Darshanavaran Chatushk, Gyanavaran Panchak, and Antaraya Panchak are also destroyed.

**Special Meaning:** The verse describes the Kshapak category. The one who attains the Kshapak category directly reaches the twelfth stage from the tenth stage. Therefore, after the tenth stage, the existence of karma natures, etc., in the twelfth stage is described.

There are 102 natures existing in the tenth stage. Of these 102 natures, with the destruction of the Sanjvalana Lobha Kshaya in the final time, there are 101 natures existing in the twelfth stage. But these 101 natures exist in this stage only until the second extreme time.

Page #151:
---------------------------
## Second Karma Granth
### 115

It should be understood that out of these 101 **Prakritis**, the two **Prakritis** of **Nidra** and **Prachala** are destroyed, leaving 66 **Prakritis** remaining at the final moment.

In the twelfth **Gunasthan**, **Mohaniya Karma** is completely destroyed. Therefore, the **Karma Prakritis** that are bound, arise, and remain in existence due to the intensity of **Mohaniya Karma** in the **Sattayogya Prakritis** do not remain. Due to **Mohaniya Karma**, there is a possibility of binding, arising, and existence of the 14 **Prakritis** - **Jnanavaran**, five **Antaraya**, and four **Darshanavaran** like **Chakshudarshanavaran**. However, with the destruction of **Mohaniya Karma Prakritis**, the binding, arising, and existence of these 14 **Prakritis** also cease to exist. Therefore, at the final moment of the twelfth **Gunasthan**, the four **Darshanavaran** - **Chakshu**, **Achakshu**, **Avadhi Kevaldarshanavaran**, the five **Jnanavaran** - **Mati**, **Shruta**, **Avadhi**, **Manahparyaya**, and **Kevaljnanavaran**, and the five **Antaraya** - **Dan**, **Labh**, **Bhom**, **Upbhog**, and **Veerya** - **Antaraya**, a total of 14 **Prakritis** are destroyed.

---

When the **Karma** that are **Pratibandhak Karana** (obstructive causes) are destroyed, the **Atma** becomes free from the veil of **Chetana** (consciousness), and the **Keval Upayog** (absolute use) manifests. **Keval Upayog** means complete knowledge, both general and specific. The **Pratibandhak** (obstructive) **Karma** for this **Keval Upayog** are **Jnanavaran**, **Darshanavaran**, **Mohaniya**, and **Antaraya** - these four **Karma**. Among these, **Mohaniya Karma** is the main one. Only after the destruction of **Mohaniya Karma** do the remaining three **Karma** - **Darshanavaran**, **Jnanavaran**, and **Antaraya** - get destroyed. Upon their destruction, **Kaivalya** (liberation) is attained. Therefore,

1. **Samanya Upayog** is **Keval Darshan**, **Vishesh Upayog** is **Keval Jnan**.
2. **Moksajjnanadarshanavaranantaragkshayaccha Kevalam**. (Tattvarth Sutra 10.1)

Page #152:
---------------------------
Firstly, it explains the arising and existence of the karmic substances that are inseparable from the mohaniya karma, from the first Mithyatva ganasthana to the twelfth Kshinamoha ganasthana, and then it explains the cessation of the existence of the four darshanavaranas, five jnanavaranas, and five antarayas at the end. Similarly, the fourteen karmic substances are also present in the karmic substances that cease to arise at the end of the twelfth ganasthana.

Thus, when the fourteen karmic substances, including darshanavaranas, etc., cease to exist out of the sixty-six karmic substances that are capable of existing at the end of the twelfth ganasthana, the thirteenth ganasthana is attained.

Now, in the following verses, we will explain the number of karmic substances that remain in the thirteenth and fourteenth ganasthanas, and the names of the karmic substances that cease to exist.

**Verse 31:**
The sa yogi and a yogi karmic substances remain until the end of the two extremes of the ganasthanas.

**Verse 32:**
The devadvik, vihayogati dvik, gandha dvik, eight sparsh, varna, rasa, sharira, bandhana, and sanghatan, each with five, the nirmaan naam, sanhanan shatk, asthir shatk, sansthan shatk, aguru labu tuksh, apariapt naam, sata or asata vedaniya, each with three, and the suswar and nich gotra, these 72 karmic substances cease to exist in the fourteenth...

## Secondary Mantra

In the second extreme time of the fourteenth Gunasthan, the human triad, the seventeen, the fame and glory, the name of the giver, the auspicious name, the name of the Jina, the five-sense beings, and the seven or non-seven sensations, these 13 substances remain. When these 13 substances also perish in the final time of the fourteenth Gunasthan, the soul becomes free from karma and liberated.

**Special Meaning:** In the above three verses, the number of substances that are capable of existence in the thirteenth and fourteenth Gunasthan, and the names of the substances that perish, have been explained through nouns, etc.

In the twelfth Gunasthan, out of the 66 substances capable of existence, 14 substances like Darshanavaran, etc., perish, leaving 85 substances capable of existence in the thirteenth Gunasthan. These 85 substances remain in the thirteenth Gunasthan and also in the second extreme time (before the final time) of the fourteenth Gunasthan. Out of these, 72 substances also perish in the second extreme time of the fourteenth Gunasthan, leaving only 13 substances capable of existence in the final time. When these also perish in the final time, the soul attains its pure form.

The 85 substances of the thirteenth and fourteenth Gunasthan are bound, arise, and exist due to yoga. Until the twelfth Gunasthan, the substances bound due to Mithyatva and continuous Kshaya perish, and those that exist due to yoga perish in the thirteenth and fourteenth Gunasthan. Most of these yoga-induced substances are related to Kaya Yoga, and when the yogas cease, some become Jiva-vipaki and some become Kshetra-vipaki, mainly along with Pudgala-vipaki in the second extreme time of the fourteenth Gunasthan.

The essence of the **Prakritis** is destroyed. The names of the **Prakritis** that are subject to destruction are:

1. These **Prakritis** should be classified as **Kshetravipaki**, **Jivavipaki** and **Pudumalavipaki** **Prakritis** as follows.

Page #155:
---------------------------
## The Text of the Karma Grantha (Chapter 119)

**At the culmination of the 14th Gunasthan, the 72 Prakṛtis mentioned earlier are destroyed. In the final stage, the following 13 Prakṛtis remain:**

* **Manushyatrika:** Manushya-Gati, Manushyanupūrvi, and Manushyayu
* **Asatrika:** Pras, Vādar, Paryāpta Nāma, Yash Kirti, Ādeya Nāma, Subhaga, Tīrthankara, Uchchagotra, Pacchendriya Jāti, and Sāta or Asāta Vedaniya (one of these).

**These remaining 13 Prakṛtis are such that when an Ayogika Kevali Bhagavan, in the state of Samuccchinnākriyā-apratipāti Shukla-Dhyāna, meditates, they are destroyed within the time it takes to utter five short syllables. This complete liberation from Karma results in the experience of infinite bliss, free from the eight Karmas (Jñānāvarana, etc.). They become peaceful, free from the stain of Bhavakarma (the cause of new Karma-bandha), eternal, possessing the eight qualities of Jñāna, Darshan, Sukha, Virya, Avyābādha, Avagāhana, Amūrtatva, and Agurulaghu.

The number of karmas and their destruction at the end of their respective times has been stated. Now, in the following verse, the conclusion of the text is made by clearly stating the destruction of 12 karmas out of 13 karmas that are capable of existing at the end of the 14th gunasthan.

**Verse 34:**
"Salutation to the Lord who, at the end of the 14th gunasthan, has destroyed the twelve karmas, excluding the manushyanupurvi karma, and attained liberation. Salutation to the great Mahavira, who is praised by the Devas and the Devas."

**Explanation:**
The previous verse stated that all 13 karmas cease to exist at the end of the 14th gunasthan, which is the state of a liberated being. However, this verse concludes the text by hinting at the destruction of only 12 karmas.

Some Acharyas believe that the manushyanupurvi karma, a type of karma related to human existence, is destroyed by the process of stibukasankrama (transfer) into the ghabin manushya-gati karma (karma related to the human state of being) within the manushyatrika (human triad) during the second-last stage of the 14th gunasthan. Therefore, it does not remain at the end of the 14th gunasthan. The remaining 12 karmas cannot undergo stibukasankrama without their own kind, so their dalikas (particles) remain at the end of the 14th gunasthan.

**Note:**
* **Gunasthan:** A stage of spiritual development in Jainism.
* **Karma:** Actions that bind the soul to the cycle of birth and death.
* **Stibukasankrama:** A process of transferring karma from one type to another.
* **Dalika:** A particle of karma.
* **Manushyanupurvi:** A type of karma related to human existence.
* **Manushyatrika:** The human triad, consisting of body, speech, and mind.
* **Ghabin manushya-gati karma:** Karma related to the human state of being.
* **Devas:** Gods in Jain cosmology.
* **Devasena:** The assembly of gods.
* **Mahavira:** The last Tirthankara (spiritual teacher) of the present age.

## Second Karma Granth

In the Second Karma Granth, it is stated that the karmas which are present in the being but have not yet matured, their existence is destroyed in the extreme time periods. All four Anupurvi karmas are Kshetravipaki, therefore their maturation occurs in the interval between death (leaving the body of this birth) and taking birth in another body.

The karmas which mature after the cessation of their uninterrupted time period are of two types:

(1) Rasodaya, (2) Pradeshodaya.

Direct experience of bound karmas is called Rasodaya. The experience of bound karmas in another form (the karmas which are bound to the extremely subtle, their essence is experienced along with the essence of other similar natures that are being experienced, like water whose essence cannot be known by its own ripening) is called Pradeshodaya.

The reason for experiencing karmas along with other natures is that for Rasodaya to occur, there are five causes: Dravya, Kshetra, Kala, Bhava, and Bhaya. In the absence of one or more of these causes, the karma does not experience Rasodaya.

For example, a being while living in the human realm, bound the karma of Ekendriya Jati. Later, due to pure results, it bound the karma of Panchaindriya Jati, which is suitable for the Deva realm, and was born in the Deva realm as a Panchaindriya being. The uninterrupted time period of Ekendriya Jati passed, but for the Rasodaya of that Ekendriya Jati, the cause in the form of the Bhav (realm) is required, which is absent in the Deva realm. Therefore, that karma does not experience Rasodaya but experiences Pradeshodaya.

When the maturing karma does not find the path of Rasodaya for its ripening, its ripening takes the path of Pradeshodaya. In the occurrence of this Pradeshodaya, the natural ripening of those karmas takes the form of 'Sthibhuka Sankraman'. In other words, the transition of non-matured natures to similar matured natures is called Sthibhuka Sankraman. This can also be called Pradeshodaya.

Page #158:

Karyastava
This happens, not in the Bhavasthana-Janmasthana. Therefore, due to the absence of उदय (arising), the 73 Prakṛtis (principles) of the Ayogi Gunasthana-dwelling soul are destroyed in the Dvicharama time, and the 12 Prakṛtis are destroyed in the Antyma time. That is, the Devadvika, etc., the aforementioned 72 Prakṛtis, which do not arise, are destroyed in the Dvicharama time by being transferred to the Udya-vati Karma-Prakṛtis through Stikasamkrama (transfer of substance), in the same way, due to the absence of उदय, the Garmit Manushyanupurvi Prakṛti in the Manushyatrika is also transferred to the Udya-vati Prakṛtis through Stibukasamkrama in the Vicharama time. Therefore, the existence of the Manushyanupurvi, which is transferred to the Udya-vati Karma-Prakṛti in the Dvicharama time, should not be considered in the Charma time. Therefore, in the Antyma time of the Chaudahva Gunasthana, the destruction of 12 Prakṛtis should be considered instead of 13.

In this way, after hinting at the alternative view of the cessation of existence in the Chaudahva Gunasthana, the author concludes the text by saying that those who have attained liberation by destroying all Karma-Prakṛtis, and who are worshipped by the Devendras or by the Devendrasūri, offer your salutations to the Supreme Soul, Mahavira.

Detailed information about the binding, arising, and existence of Karma-Prakṛtis in the Gunasthanas, and their destruction at their respective ends, is given in the Appendix.

## Explanation of Karma Bandha, Uday and Satva

**Bandha**

The acceptance of new karmas is called bandha. Although the jiva is inherently formless, it is embodied in the world and thus somewhat form-bound. In this state, it has been accepting form-bound karma pudgalas since time immemorial due to kshaya and yoga. There are many types of pudgal varganas, and the jiva accepts those that have the potential to transform into karma. It then connects them to its own atma-pradeshas through a specific relationship of conjunction.

Among these, the karma bandha that occurs due to the arising of kshaya is called **samparayik bandha**, and the rest are called **yoga-nimittak** (yoga-pratyayik) bandha. Here, the term kshaya generally refers to mohaniya karma.

The main causes of bandha are yoga and kshaya (mohaniya karma). The type of karma that binds depends on the type of nimitta present in the guna-sthana. For example, the satavedaniya karma-prakriti binds due to yoga, while the asatavedaniya karma-prakriti requires the cooperation of kshaya for its binding.

There are two types of bandha that occur due to mohaniya karma (kshaya): **pramadasahkrit** and **apramadasahkrit**. Within mohaniya karma, there are also nimittas such as **sukshmasamparaya**, **badarasamparaya**, and **badarasamparaya** with **nivritti**, **anivritti**, **yathapravritti**, **apurvakaran**, **pratyakhyaneya**, **apratyakhyaneya**, **anantaanubandhniya**, **mithyatva**, etc. The **samyaktvasahakrit sankleg parinam** also acts as a nimitta in bandha.

**(P)**  Each Gunasthan (stage of spiritual development) has specific karmas that can be bound and others that cannot. Understanding the reasons for this and the specific Gunasthan where each of the 120 karmas can be bound, provides a detailed understanding of karma binding in the Gunasthanas.

**(Uvay - Udirana)**

The fruition of karma is called **Uday** (arising), which occurs when the conditions of substance, space, time, and emotion are fulfilled. From the moment a karma is bound, it begins to exist. When the time for a karma to fructify arrives, a special structure called **Niseka** is formed within the karma-dalikas (karma particles). The karma located at the front of the Niseka resides in the **Udayavali** (arising stream) and begins to bear fruit.

Even if the time for fruition is not fully complete, the soul's karmic actions...

Page #163:
---------------------------
The special effect of karma, which is the special determination, is called **Udirana** when it comes to fruition in the **Udayavali** (the cycle of arising). It is important to understand that the **Samyaktvamohaniya Karma** arises from the fourth to the seventh **Gunasthanas** (stages of spiritual progress), the **Tirthankara Nama Karma** arises in the thirteenth and fourteenth **Gunasthanas**, and the **Pradeshodaya** begins from the fourth **Gunasthanas**.

There are 122 **Prakritis** (categories of karma) that are capable of arising, and their arising is caused by the following factors. The term **Avinabhavi** (inseparable) should be understood as "always present".

(1) **Kevalgyan-Adhinabhavi Prakruti - Tirthankara Nama Karma** (1)

For example, the causes of Pramattabhaav's Mithyatva, Anantaanubandhikashaya, etc., Baabar (Sthula) Kashaya are possible until the ninth Gunasthan. In a Saansarik Jeeva who is very close to attaining Siddhatva, Manushabhav and Kevalshaan Avinabhaavi Prakrutis are also included. These causes are indicated here for the ease of the students.

Udeerna should be understood like Uday, and the increase or decrease in the Prakrutis mentioned in it should be understood accordingly.

## Second Karma Granth: Appendix
### 131

This section discusses the qualifications of those who are capable of attaining the Gunasthanas and those who are not. In the scriptures, they are respectively called **Bhavya** and **Abhavya**. These categories are further divided into two: those who have not attained **Saparyaya** and those who have attained **Shraparyaya**.  

Within these categories, there are also two further divisions: those who have bound the lifespan of their next birth in the same state and those who have not. These are called **Purvaayusk** and **Abaddhayusk**. 

In summary, there are the following distinctions:

1. **Anadi Mithyatvi Saparyaya Aprapta Purvabaddhayusk**
2. **Anadi Mithyatvi Saparyaya Aprapta Abaddhayusk**
3. **Anadi Mithyatvi Saparyaya Prapt Purvabaddhayusk**
4. **Anadi Mithyatvi Saparyaya Prapt Abaddhayusk**

These four categories, when considered in relation to **Bhavya** and **Abhavya**, result in a total of eight distinctions.

These distinctions will help us understand the existence of **Prakritis** in the **Mithyatva Gunasthan**. However, before understanding the existence of **Prakritis**, it is important to note that those who have never attained **Shraparyaya** will never have the **Prakritis** of **Manushyadvik**, **Narakadvik**, **Devadvik**, **Vaishriyachaturk**, **Aharakchaturk**, **Narakay**, **Manushyayu**, **Devayu**, **Samyaktvamohaniya**, **Mishramohaniya**, **Gotra**, and **Tirthankara** **Namakarma**.  

Similarly, those who are **Anadi Mithyatvi** will never have the **Prakritis** of **Samyaktvamohaniya**, **Mishramohaniya**, **Aharakchaturk**, and **Tirthankara** **Namakarma**. A being can have a maximum of two **Ayukarma** **Prakritis**.

Now, let's discuss the existence of these eight categories in detail.

Page #167:
---------------------------
## Appendix (1-2)

Except for the aforementioned twenty-one **Prakritis** of the **Abhavya** beings with **Anadi Mithyatva**, **Asaparyaaya-Anapta**, **Purvabaddhaayushk** and **Abaddhaayushk**, there are 127 **Prakritis** in existence.

(3) The **Abhavya** being with **Anadi Mithyatva**, **Asaparyaaya-Anapta**, and **Purvabaddhaayushk** also has **Anadi Mithyatva**, so the seven **Prakritis** like **Samyaktava-Mohaniya** etc., which are opposite to it, do not exist. Due to **Purvabaddhaayushk**, there are 141 **Prakritis** in existence for many beings, and considering one being, there are 136 **Prakritis** for the being who binds the **Aaya** of other **Gati**, and 138 **Prakritis** for the being who binds the **Aaya** of its own **Gati**.

(4) The **Abhavya** being with **Anadi Mithyatva**, **Saparyaaya-Anapta**, and **Abaddhaayushk** has **Anadi Mithyatva**, so the seven **Prakritis** like **Samyaktava-Mohaniya** etc., do not exist. Due to **Abaddhaayushk**, the **Bhujyaman Aayu** exists. Therefore, the remaining three **Aayu** do not exist. Thus, 138 **Prakritis** exist without those ten **Prakritis**.

(5-6) The **Bhavya** beings with **Anadi Mithyatva**, **Asaparyaaya-Anapta**, **Purvabaddhaayushk** and **Abaddhaayushk** should be understood to have the same existence of **Karma-Prakritis** as the **Abhavya** beings, according to the first and second **Bhangas** mentioned for the **Abhavya** beings. That is, like those **Abhavya** beings, these two types of **Bhavya** beings should also be understood to have 127 **Prakritis** in existence.

(7) The **Bhavya** being with **Anadi Mithyatva**, **Saparyaaya-Anapta**, and **Purvabaddhaayushk** has **Anadi Mithyatva**, so except for the seven **Prakritis** like **Samyaktava-Mohaniya** etc., there are 141 **Prakritis** in existence for many beings, and considering one being, there are

## Second Karma Granth: Appendix
### 133
### 136
A being bound by the lifespan of the same motion has the existence of 138 karmic natures.
### 138
(4) The karmic natures of an Anadi Mithyatvi, Saparyaya-obtained, Abaddha-Shushk Bhavy being are subject to decay - (1) Sadbhavasatta (2) Sambhavasatta.
Those beings who are destined to attain liberation in the same bhava and possess the existence of present karmic natures, both types of beings are included in Sadbhavasatta. And those beings whose lifespan is possible, are included in Sambhavasatta.
Beings with Sadbhavasatta have the existence of 138 karmic natures except for the ten natures - seven including Samyaktvamohaniya and three Ayus. They only have Bhujyaman Ayus.
In beings with Sambhavasatta, (1) due to the counting of all four Ayus in relation to many beings, there is the existence of 141 karmic natures, devoid of the mother natures including Samyaktvamohaniya. (2) In relation to one being, the one bound by the lifespan of another motion has the existence of 136 karmic natures, and (3) the one bound by the lifespan of the same motion has the existence of 138 karmic natures.
Thus, after explaining the existence in relation to Anadi Mithyatvdrishti, now we explain the existence of karmic natures in Sadi Mithyatvdrishti -
One who, after attaining Samyaktv, falls back to the first Gunasthan due to the influence of a complex determination, is called Sadi Mithyatvi. Some of them fall from a higher category, while others only fall from Samyaktv. Those who come here after disassociating from Anantanubandhi after attaining Samyaktv, do not have the existence of Anantanubandhi.

Page #169:

4. 
It is said that there is existence, but because of the bondage here, there is also existence. Therefore, there is existence of 148 prakritis for the beings with pre-determined lifespan, compared to all beings.
Karmstava Parishista F
There is also existence of 148 prakritis for the beings with non-determined lifespan, compared to all beings. The reason for this is that there are beings in all four gatis who do not have the bondage of ayukarma (avandhak). There is existence of 145 prakritis compared to a particular gati.
Upon careful consideration, there are ten divisions of this: (1) Sadimitryatvi with existence of Tirthankara namekarma (purvabaddhayu), (2) Sadimitryatvi with existence of Tirthankara namekarma (abaddhayu), (3) Sadimitryatvi with existence of Aharakchatushk (purvabaddhayu), (4) Sadimitryatvi with existence of Aharakchatushk (abaddhayu), (5) Sadimitryatvi without existence of Tirthankara namekarma and Aharakchatushk (purvabaddhayu), (6) Sadimitryatvi without existence of Tirthankara namekarma and Aharakchatushk (abaddhayu), (7) Sadimitryatvi without existence of Tirthankara namekarma and Aharakchatushk, Samyaktvamohaniya udvelak (purvabaddhayu), (8) Sadimitryatvi without existence of Tirthankara namekarma and Aharakchatushk, Samyaktvamohaniya udvelak (abaddhayu), (9) Sadimitryatvi without existence of Tirthankara namekarma and Aharakchatushk, Samyaktvamohaniya and Mishramohaniya udvelak (purvabaddhayu), and (10) Sadimitryatvi without existence of Tirthankara namekarma and Aharakchatushk, Samyaktvamohaniya and Mishramohaniya udvelak (abaddhayu).
Those who have existence of Tirthankara namekarma, do not have existence of Aharakchatushk in this Mithyatva gunasthan. The existence in the above ten divisions should be understood in this way.

##  Appendix to the Second Karma Text

**(1)**  For a being with **Sadi-mithyadristi** and **Purvavaddhayusk** (predetermined lifespan), excluding the six karmas of **Aharak-chatushk**, **Tiyanchayusk**, and **Devayusk**, there are 142 karmas present, including the **Tirthankara-namakarma**.

**(2)** For a being with **Sadi-mithyadristi** and **Avaddhayusk** (uncertain lifespan), excluding the seven karmas of **Aharak-chatushk**, **Tiyanchayusk**, **Devayusk**, and the three **Ayukarma** (lifespan karmas), there are 141 karmas present, including the **Tirthankara-namakarma**.

**(3)** For a being with **Sadi-mithyadristi** and **Purvavaddhayusk**, including the **Aharak-chatushk**, there are 147 karmas present for multiple beings, excluding the **Tirthankara-namakarma**. For a single being, there are 144 karmas present if the **Ayukarma** binds the lifespan in the same **Gati** (realm), and 145 karmas present if the **Ayukarma** binds the lifespan in a different **Gati**.

**(4)** For a being with **Sadi-mithyadristi** and **Avaddhayusk**, including the **Aharak-chatushk**, there are different **Ayukarma** present in all four **Gatis**. Therefore, there are 143 karmas present for multiple beings, excluding the **Tirthankara-namakarma**, and 145 karmas present for a single being.

**(5)** For a being with **Sadi-mithyadristi** and **Purvavaddhayusk**, excluding the **Tirthankara-namakarma** and **Aharak-chatushk**, there are 143 karmas present for multiple beings. For a single being, there are 140 karmas present if the **Ayukarma** binds the lifespan in the same **Gati**, and 141 karmas present if the **Ayukarma** binds the lifespan in a different **Gati**.

**(6)** For a being with **Sadi-mithyadristi** and **Avaddhayusk**, excluding the **Tirthankara-namakarma** and **Aharak-chatushk**, there are different **Ayukarma** present in all four **Gatis**. Therefore, there are 143 karmas present for multiple beings, and 140 karmas present for a single being.

**(7)**  In **pre-bound-lifespan**, **false-belief-originated** beings with **Tirthankara-name-karma**, **food-four-karma**, and **right-belief-obscuring** as **stimulants**, have **142** **karmic-categories** in relation to all beings, and **136** **karmic-categories** in relation to one being for binding the lifespan of that particular **gati**, and **140** **karmic-categories** for binding the lifespan of other **gatis**.

There are different types, and after the manifestation of *Samyaktvamohaniya*, the *Mishramohaniya* manifests in the first *Gunasthan*.  _After explaining the existence of natures in the *Mithyatva Gunasthan* in relation to the general being, the four paths explain the existence of natures in relation to the *Anadi* and *Sadi* *Mithyadrishti* beings. Among them, the existence of *Karma* natures in the four paths in relation to the *Anadi Mithyadrishti* is as follows:_

* **Hell Path:** Beings in this path can only bind the two *Ayas* of *Manushya* and *Tiryanch*. Therefore, the aforementioned two *Ayas* and the *Bhujyaman Narakayu* can exist in relation to many beings, and out of the eight *Bhedas* mentioned earlier for the *Anadi Mithyadrishti*, only four *Bhedas* of *Asaparyaya-Prapta* can exist here. Therefore, in sequence, the third, fourth, seventh, and eighth *Bhedas* can exist in the *Narakagati* for the *Purvabaddhayushk* in relation to many beings, with seven *Prakritis* including *Samyaktvamohaniya* and without *Devayu*, totaling 140 *Prakritis*. In the realm of possibility, the existence is the same as mentioned above, and in relation to one being, there are 136 *Prakritis*, and for the *Abaddhayushk*, there are 138 *Prakritis*.

* **Tiryanch Path:** In this path, all eight options mentioned earlier for the *Anadi Mithyadrishti* can exist, and accordingly, the existence can also be. However, the special thing is that when the *Asaparyaya-Prapta* being attains the *Tejaskayik* and *Vayukayik* *Paryaya*, if it manifests *Devatik* or *Narakatik*, then it will not go to another path, so it will have the *Dev*, *Manushya*, and *Narakayu* suitable for it, and being *Anadi Mithyadrishti*, it will have seven *Prakritis* including *Samyaktvamohaniya*, totaling twelve *Prakritis*, except for one being, which will have 136 *Prakritis*, and as mentioned earlier, the *Devadvik* or *Narakadvik*...

If one were to extract the remaining one pair from these two pairs and the four pairs of Vaikriya, and then extract the 160 pairs of the pole of the husband, and then extract the 126 pairs of human beings, then there would be 127 types of existence.
If the earth, water, and plant-bodied beings were to extract the pair of hell or the pair of heaven, then due to being eternally false, there would be seven types of existence, including the delusion of right knowledge, etc., and due to not going to heaven or hell, there would be two types of existence, making a total of nine types of existence. Without these nine types of existence, there would be 136 types of existence for the many beings. Because some may extract the pair of hell and some may extract the pair of heaven, but both pairs exist in the existence of many beings. If one were to extract only one type of pair, then there would be 135 types of existence for those beings, and for the many beings with the previous lifespan, there would be 135 types of existence for those who bind the human lifespan, and 536 types of existence for those who bind the lifespan of the Tiryach and those who are eternally dry. If the Vaikriya disintegration were to be considered as a proper extraction, then there would be 131 types of existence instead of 137, and 130 types of existence instead of 136. _ The aforementioned existence should not be understood only in the luminous-bodied and air-bodied beings, but also in the other Tiryach that have come out from there, in the state of insufficiency for a short period of time. Therefore, it can also be considered there. The remaining Tiryach beings also have the third, fourth, seventh, and eighth options out of the eight options mentioned earlier. _ In the human path, the third, fourth, seventh, and eighth options out of the eight options mentioned earlier for the eternally false are possible, therefore, the types of existence should be understood accordingly.

It is required. But for those who are in hell or heaven, who have the seven karmas of Samyaktvamohaniya etc., and the remaining three karmas of Abaddhayushk, a total of twelve karmas, except for one being, there are 136 karmas, for many beings, there are 135 karmas, and for the unique and the aforementioned dual, there are 130 karmas, which can also exist for a very short time.

**Deva-Gati:** Beings in this gati do not go to hell. Therefore, they do not bind the karmas of the corresponding lifespan and are Anadi-Mithyatvi. Except for the seven karmas of Samyaktvamohaniya etc., and the eight karmas of the aforementioned Abaddhayushk, there are 140 karmas for many beings, 136 karmas for one being, and 138 karmas for the Abaddhayushk.

Now, we will explain the existence of karmas in the four gatis with respect to Sadi-Mithyatva.

**Naraka-Gati:** In this gati, for many beings with Abaddhayushk, there are 147 karmas because they do not bind the karmas of Deva-Ayushk. For many beings with one type of lifespan, there are 146 karmas, and for many beings with Abaddhayushk, there are 45 karmas.

- If a being with the Tirthankara name-karma is in Naraka-Gati with Abaddhayushk in the first Gunasthan, then he will not have the seven karmas of Aharak-Chatushk, Deva, Manushya, and Tiryanch Ayushk, resulting in 141 karmas. For many beings with Abaddhayushk and Aharak-Chatushk, there are 146 karmas, for one being, there are 145 karmas, and for Abaddhayushk, there are 144 karmas.

For many beings with Abaddhayushk and without the Tirthankara name-karma and Aharak-Chatushk, there are 142 karmas, for one being, there are 141 karmas, and for Abaddhayushk, there are 140 karmas. Among them, ...

## Chapter 140: Appendix on Karma

**For the Samyaktvamohaniya:**

* **Uddēlka** (arousing) has **141** types for **many beings**, **140** for **one being**, **136** for **Abaddhāyuṣka** (unbound lifespan), and **140** for **Miśramohaniya** (mixed delusion) **Uddēlka** (arousing) for **many beings**, **139** for **one being**, and **138** for **Abaddhāyuṣka**.

**For the Tiryanchati (animal) realm:**

* **Tīrthankara** (liberated being) **karma** does not exist. Therefore, there are **14.7** types for **many beings**, **144** for **one being** who binds this realm, **145** for **one being** who binds another realm, and **144** for **Abaddhāyuṣka**.

**For the Āhārakacatuṣka (four types of food) free Abaddhāyuṣka:**

* There are **143** types for **many beings**, **141** for **one being** who binds this realm, and **141** for **Abaddhāyuṣka**.

**For the Samyaktvamohaniya Uddēlka Abaddhāyuṣka:**

* There are **142** types for **many beings**, **136** for **one being** who binds this realm, and **140** for **one being** who binds another realm.

**For the Miśramohaniya Uddēlka Abaddhāyuṣka:**

* There are **143** types for **many beings**, **136** for **one being** who binds another realm, **138** for **one being** who binds this realm, and **538** for **Abaddhāyuṣka**.

**For the Tejaskaayika (fire-bodied) and Vāyukaayika (air-bodied) realms:**

* If **Āhārakacatuṣka** is aroused, there are **140** types.
* If **Samyaktvamohaniya** is aroused, there are **136** types.
* If **Miśramohaniya** is aroused, there are **138** types.
* If **Devadvika** (two types of gods) or **Narakadvika** (two types of hell beings) is aroused, there are **136** types for **Abaddhāyuṣka** and **138** for **many beings**.

When performing (an action), there are 126 **Prakritis** for a **Manushya-dvik**, and when reducing (an action), there are 127 **Prakritis**.
This existence is for a short period of time for other **Tiryanchas** who have come from **Tejas-kayika** and **Vayu-kayika**. For other **Sthavaras**, there are 130 **Prakritis** even if they have not come from **Tejas-kayika** and **Vayu-kayika**. And if a **Manushya-ayika** with 130 **Prakritis** binds **Karma**, then there are 131 **Prakritis**.

_**Manushya-Gati**_ In this **Gati**, there are 146 **Prakritis** for **Bayushka** compared to many beings, 146 **Prakritis** for many beings who bind the lifespan of the same **Gati**, 145 **Prakritis** for many beings who bind the same **Gati**, and 145 **Prakritis** for **Abadhayushka**.

_**Aharak-Chatushk**_ There are 147 **Prakritis** for **Aharak-Chatushk** compared to many beings who have **Purva-Basayu**, 144 **Prakritis** for those who bind the lifespan of the same **Gati**, 145 **Prakritis** for those who bind another **Gati**, and 144 **Prakritis** for **Abadhayushka**.

If a **Baddhayushka** who is **Samyak-tvamohaniya** is **Udvellana**, then there are 142 **Prakritis** for many beings without **Tirthankara-namakarma**, **Aharak-Chatushk**, and **Samyak-tvamohaniya**, 140 **Prakritis** for one being who binds the lifespan of another **Gati**, 136 **Prakritis** for one being who binds the same **Gati**, 136 **Prakritis** for **Abaddhayushka**, and if there is **Udvellana** of **Devadvik** or **Narakadvik**, then there are 143 **Prakritis** for many beings without **Tirthankara-namakarma** and **Aharak-Chatushk** for a **Baddhayushka**.

If the Devadvik or Narakadvik is agitated, then there are 142 types of entities in relation to many beings, and if one Trik out of the two Dviks is agitated, then there are 140 types of entities in relation to many beings, and the one who binds that motion has 137 types of entities, and the one who binds the other motion has 138 types of entities. Just as the existence of 138 and 136 types of entities has been stated in relation to many beings in sequence, in the same way, the one who agitates the Mishramohaniya (where there are 142, 140, 138, and 137 types of entities, it has been said, there should be understood 141, 136, 137, and 136 types of entities).
Devagati - In this motion, if we consider in relation to many beings, then there are 146 types of entities in this Gunasthan except for Tirthankara Namakarma and Narakayu, and 145 types of entities in relation to one being, and 144 types of entities for Abaddhayushk, and 142 types of entities for many beings who are bound by Ayushk without the existence of Aharana Chatushk, and 141 types of entities for one being, and 140 types of entities for Abaddhayushk.
Thus, in the first Mithyatva Gunasthan, the existence of 127, 126, 130, 131, 136, 137, 138, 136, 140, 142, 142, 103, 144, 145, 146, 147, and 148 has been considered in relation to Anadi Mithyadrishti and Sadi Mithyadrishti. Now, in the second Sasadan Gunasthan, we describe the existence of Karmapratikrtis.
(2) Sasadan Gunasthan - In this Gunasthan, it should be understood specifically about the existence of Karmapratikrtis that
(1) There is no existence of Tirthankara Namakarma in this Gunasthan. (2) Only those who have Devadvik, Narakadvik, and Vaikiya Chatushk in their existence come in this Gunasthan, and those who have Aharaka Chatushk in their existence also come.

(3) This Gunasthan is only for those who fall from above.
In this Gunasthan, the existence of beings will be stated in two types: Purvabaddhayu and Abaddhayu, similar to the previous ones. Among them, there are four divisions: those with the existence of Aharak Chatushk and those without the existence of Aharak Chatushk.

—

The existence of Karma Prakritis in these divisions is as follows:
(1) In the Sasvadan Gunasthan, those with Purvabaddhayu and the existence of Aharak Chatushk have 47 Prakritis for Peevas, 145 for those binding the lifespan of another being in a different motion, 144 for those binding the lifespan of the same motion, and 145 Prakritis for those binding the lifespan of many beings.
(2) In the Sasvadan Gunasthan, those with Abaddhayu and the existence of Aharak Chatushk have 147 Prakritis for many beings and 144 for one being.
(3) In the Sasvadan Gunasthan, those with Purvabaddhayu and without the existence of Aharak Chatushk have 143 Prakritis for many beings, 141 for those binding the lifespan of another being in a different motion, 140 for those binding the lifespan of the same motion, and 141 Prakritis for those binding the lifespan of many beings.
(4) In the Sasvadan Gunasthan, those with Abaddhayu and without the existence of Aharak Chatushk have 143 Prakritis for many beings and 140 for one being.

After stating it generally, now we will explain the existence of Prakritis for the beings in the Sasvadan Gunasthan in relation to their motions.

## Karmastava Parishishta

**Hell Realm:** There are 146 types of beings in the Hell realm, with respect to those who have a previous lifespan (Purvaayushk), 145 types with respect to a single being, and 144 types with respect to those who have an unfixed lifespan (Abaddhaayushk). If the four types of Aahaarak (food) are not present, then there are 142, 141, and 140 types of beings respectively.

**144**

The same principle of types of beings should be understood for the Tiryanch (animal) realm, the Human realm, and the Dev (divine) realm, as per the Hell realm, with respect to those who have the Saasvadan (taste) Gunasthan (state of being).

Thus, there are 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, and 145 types of beings in the Saasvadan Gunasthan.

**(3) Mixed Gunasthan:** The types of beings in this Gunasthan should be understood in the same way as the Saasvadan Gunasthan. However, the difference is that the Saasvadan Gunasthan is for those who fall from higher Gunasthan, while the Mixed Gunasthan is for those who ascend.

The types of beings in the Mixed Gunasthan are explained through two categories: those with the four types of Aahaarak present and those without the four types of Aahaarak.

**(1) Mixed Gunasthan with the four types of Aahaarak present:** There are 147 types of beings with respect to those who have a previous lifespan, 145 types with respect to those who have a fixed lifespan for a single type of existence, 145 types with respect to those who have a fixed lifespan for multiple types of existence, and 144 types with respect to a single being. For those who have disintegrated the four types of Anantaanubandhi Kashay (infinitely binding passions), four types should be subtracted, meaning 147, 145, 144...

## Second Karma Granth: Appendix

**145** One should understand the existence of 143, 141, and 140 **Prakritis** in the **Gunasthan** of those who have the existence of **Aharak Chatushk**. In this **Gunasthan**, **Samyaktvamohaniya** is definitely present. Compared to many beings, **Abaddhayushk** has 147 **Prakritis**, compared to one being, it has 144 **Prakritis**, and those who disassociate have 143 and 140 **Prakritis** respectively.

**(2)** In the **Gunasthan** of mixed **Prakritis** where **Aharak Chatushk** is absent, compared to many beings, **Purvabaddhayushk** has 143 **Prakritis**, **Abaddhayushk** has 143 **Prakritis**, compared to one being, **Baddhayushk** has 140 **Prakritis**, and **Abavayushk** also has 140 **Prakritis**. _After **Samyaktvamohaniya** is aroused in the first **Gunasthan**, if one comes to this **Gunasthan** after arousing **Mishramohaniya**, then one **Prakriti** less is present. In other words, where 143, 141, and 140 **Prakritis** are mentioned, there are 142, 140, and 139 **Prakritis** respectively._ _Those who disassociate **Anantanubandhi Kashay Chatushk** should understand four **Prakritis** less. In other words, where 143, 141, and 140 **Prakritis** are mentioned, there are 139, 137, and 136 **Prakritis** respectively._

**Samyaktvamohaniya** without **Mana** does not disassociate **Anantanubandhi**. Because **Samyaktvamohaniya** is aroused in the first **Gunasthan** when **Mithyatva** is present, and there is no disassociation of **Anantanubandhi** there. However, even those who are without **Samyaktvamohaniya** have its existence, and **Moha** beings may come to the mixed **Gunasthan** after arousing **Mishramohaniya**, and those who disassociate come to the higher **Gunasthan**, and there **Mithyatva** is present...

However, the **Vinsayogak** (non-attachment) does not cause the **udabelana** (agitation) of **Samyaktva-mohaniya** (delusion of right faith).

**Karma-Parisishta** (Appendix on Karma):

Now, we will explain the number of **Karma-prakritis** (karmic substances) in the **Mishra-gunasthan** (mixed state of qualities) in relation to the four **gatis** (paths of existence).

**Naraka-gati** (hell path): In this path, the existence of **satta** (being) is as described earlier, but the existence of **deva-ayu** (divine lifespan) is not present. Therefore, where **deva-ayu** is counted, one **prakriti** should be subtracted. For example, if the existence of 147 **prakritis** is mentioned for many beings, then we should consider the existence of 146 **prakritis** instead.

Similarly, we should understand the existence of **prakritis** in **tiryag-gati** (animal path) and **manushya-gati** (human path). In **deva-gati** (heavenly path), we should understand this peculiarity: the existence of **naraka-ayu** (hellish lifespan) is not present, but the existence of **deva-ayu** is present. The rest should be understood according to **naraka-gati**.

Therefore, in **Mishra-gunasthan**, the following are the **satta-sthan** (places of existence): 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147.

**(4) Avirat-samyag-drishti-gunasthan** (state of unwavering right faith): In this **gunasthan**, generally, there are 148 **prakritis** in existence. For one being, the **prakritis** binding the lifespan of another path are generally 146, and the **prakritis** binding the lifespan of its own path are 145.

Generally, the aforementioned existence is mentioned in relation to all types of **samyaktvi** (right-believing) beings. However, considering the **bheda** (difference) in **samyaktva**, we need to consider the existence in relation to three types of **samyag-drishti** (right-seeing) beings: **Upasham-samyag-drishti** (right-seeing with pacification), **Kshayopa-samik-samyag-drishti** (right-seeing with pacification and destruction), and **Kshayik-samyag-drishti** (right-seeing with destruction).

## Second Karma Granth: Appendix
### 147
Among the three types of Samyagdrishti, the first, Upshama Samyaktvi, considers the existence of Karma-Prakritis in relation to Avirat Samyagdrishti.
There are two types of Upshama Samyagdrishti: (1) Avisanyojaka, (2) Visanyojaka.
**Avisanyojaka:** In relation to many Jivas, there are 148 Prakṛitis for a Jiva with a previous lifespan, 146 for a Jiva bound to another Gati, 145 for a Jiva bound to the same Gati, and 148 for an Abaddhataka in relation to many Jivas, and 145 for a single Jiva. It is important to understand that if Tirthankara-Namakarma is not present, then one Prakṛiti should be subtracted. This means that instead of 148, 146, and 145, one should consider 147, 145, and 144 Prakṛitis respectively. If Aharak-Chatushk is not present, then instead of 148, 146, and 145, one should consider 144, 142, and 141 Prakṛitis. If both Tirthankara-Namakarma and Aharak-Chatushk are not present, then one should consider 143, 141, and 140 Prakṛitis instead of 148, 146, and 145 respectively.
**Visanyojaka:** Even if Anantanubandhi-Chatushk is not present, but its root cause, Mithyatva, is present, it is still called Visanyojaka. Therefore, in relation to many Jivas with a previous lifespan, there are 144 Prakṛitis excluding Anantanubandhi-Chatushk. In relation to a single Jiva, there are 142 Prakṛitis for a Jiva bound to another Gati, 141 for a Jiva bound to the same Gati, 144 for an Abaddhataka in relation to many Jivas, and 141 for a single Jiva. It is important to understand that if Tirthankara-Namakarma is not present...

Page #183:
---------------------------
##  Appendix to Karma

If the 144, 142, and 141 **Prakṛtis** are not present, then instead of them, one should understand the presence of 143, 141, and 140 **Prakṛtis** respectively. If the **Tīrthaṅkara-nāma-karma** and **Āhārakacatuṣka** are not present, then one should understand the presence of 136, 137, and 136 **Prakṛtis** respectively.

Now, we will discuss the presence of **Karma-Prakṛtis** in relation to **Kṣayopaśamika Samyagdṛṣṭi**.

There are two types of **Kṣayopaśamika Samyagdṛṣṭi**: (1) **Vinsayojaka**, (2) **Aksayinayojaka**. One should understand the presence of **Prakṛtis** according to the **Sattā** established by the **Ubhaga-auṣadha-āṅga**. However, when a soul devoid of the **Anantānubandhī-caturṣka** experiences the **Mithyātvamohaniya**, then, in relation to many beings with **Pūrvabaddhāyuṣṭaka**, there are 143 **Prakṛtis**. In relation to one being, there are 141 **Prakṛtis** for the one who binds the **Āyu** of another **Gati**, and 140 **Prakṛtis** for the one who binds the **Āyu** of the same **Gati**. There are also 140 **Prakṛtis** for the **Abadhāyuka**.

If the **Tīrthaṅkara-nāma-karma** is not present, then instead of 143, 141, and 140, there are 142, 140, and 139 **Prakṛtis** respectively. If the **Āhārakacatuṣka** is not present, then instead of 143, 141, and 140, there are 136, 135, and 136 **Prakṛtis** respectively. If both the **Tīrthaṅkara-nāma-karma** and **Āhārakacatuṣka** are not present, then instead of 143, 141, and 140, there are 138, 136, and 135 **Prakṛtis** respectively.

If, in all the above mentioned alternatives, there is an experience of **Miśramohaniya**, then, without the **Anantānubandhī-caturṣka**, **Mithyātvamohaniya**, and **Miśramohaniya**, in relation to many beings, there are 142 **Prakṛtis** for the **Pūrvabaddhāyuṣṭaka**.

**Regarding the lifespan of a being:**

* For a being bound to another गति (realm) compared to a single being, the lifespan is 140.
* For a being bound to the same गति, the lifespan is 136.
* For an Abaddhayushk (one with an unbound lifespan), the lifespan is also 136.

**Regarding the absence of certain karmas:**

* If a being does not have the Tirthankara-namakarma, their lifespan is 141, 136, and 138 respectively.
* If a being does not have the Aharakchatushk (four types of food karma), their lifespan is 138, 136, and 135 respectively.
* If a being does not have the Tirthankara-namakarma and Aharakchatushk, their lifespan is 137, 135, and 134 respectively.

**Regarding the lifespan of a Kshayik Samyaktvi (one who has destroyed all karmas) in the fourth Gunasthan (stage of spiritual progress):**

* For a Kshayik Samyaktvi, the lifespan is 141 for a being bound to another गति, 136 for a being bound to the same गति, 138 for an Abaddhayushk, and 138 for a single being.

**Regarding the absence of certain karmas in a Kshayik Samyaktvi:**

* If a Kshayik Samyaktvi does not have the Tirthankara-namakarma, their lifespan is 140, 138, and 136 respectively.
* If a Kshayik Samyaktvi does not have the Aharakchatushk, their lifespan is 137, 135, and 134 respectively.
* If a Kshayik Samyaktvi does not have the Tirthankara-namakarma and Aharakchatushk, their lifespan is 136, 134, and 133 respectively.

**Regarding the lifespan of beings in the fourth Gunasthan based on different types of Samyaktva (right faith):**

* After discussing the lifespan of beings in the fourth Gunasthan based on the three types of Samyaktva (Aupamika, etc.), we now discuss the lifespan based on different types of Matis (mental states).

**Regarding the lifespan of beings in the Narakagati (hell realm):**

* Beings in the Narakagati do not have a lifespan.

There is the existence of **nāmakarma**, but not the existence of their **āhārakacatuṣka**. And those who have the existence of **āhārakacatuṣka**, they do not have the existence of **tīrthankara-nāmakarma**. **Kṣāyikasamyaktva** is not newly attained, and they do not experience the **udvelanā** of **mithyātva** and **miśramohaniya**. If, while experiencing the **udvelanā** of **samyaktva-mohaniya karma** in a previous life, death occurs and **narakāyu** is bound, then they complete the action of **udvelanā** upon entering **narakagati**. Therefore, they are **udvelaka** of **samyaktva-mohaniya**, but they do not initiate the action of **udvelanā**.

In this **gati**, the **upśama** of **samyakṣvī**, **avirat samyagdṛṣṭi**, **guṇasthāna** possessors, compared to many beings of previous lives, have the existence of **devāyu** in **147** cases. If they have bound the same type of **āyu**, then they have the existence of **146** cases compared to many beings. **Addhāyuṣka** has the existence of **145** cases, and compared to many beings who have the existence of **tīrthankara-nāmakarma**, they have the existence of **143** cases in **devāyu** and **pūrvabaddhāyu** without **āhārakacatuṣka**. Compared to one being, they have the existence of **142** cases, and **abaddhāyuṣka** has the existence of **149** cases. Compared to many beings who have the existence of **āhārakacatuṣka** and **pūrvabaddhāyuṣka**, they have the existence of **146** cases except for **tīrthankara-nāmakarma** and **devāyu**. Compared to one being, they have the existence of **145** cases, and **abaddhāyuṣka** has the existence of **144** **prakṛti**.

If **tīrthankara-nāmakarma** and **āhārakacatuṣka** do not exist, then compared to many beings of previous lives, they have the existence of **142** cases except for these six **prakṛti**: **tīrthankara-nāmakarma**, **āhārakacatuṣka**, and **devāyu**. Compared to one being, they have the existence of **241** cases, and **abaddhāyuṣka** has the existence of **140** **prakṛti**.

The Second Karma Grantha: Appendix

Those who have attained Samyaktv (right faith) are capable of becoming Upshama Samyaksvi (liberated from the cycle of birth and death) and Vinsayogak (free from karmic bondage). Other beings are not capable of becoming Vinsayogak in Upshama Samyaktv. Beings in the hellish realm can attain a new Upshama Samyaktv only through the three karmas, but it is not of the श्रेणी (category) type. Therefore, they are not Vinsayogak.

Kshayopaśamika Samyaktvi (those who have attained the highest state of liberation) with Avirat Samyagdristi (uninterrupted right vision) are of two types: Avisayogak (not free from karmic bondage) and Vinsayogak (free from karmic bondage). These beings should be understood according to the existence explained for Upshama Samyagdristi. However, it is a special characteristic that those beings who have come here by the arousal of Samyaktvamohaniya (the karma that causes attachment to the world) do not have the natures of Devayyu (divine beings), Tiyachyu (celestial beings), Manushayya (human beings), Mithyatvamohaniya (the karma that causes wrong belief), and Anantanuvandhi Chatushk (the four karmas that cause endless transmigration) in their existence, unlike many other beings. This is because the bondage of their future life occurs when six months of their lifespan remain. When a being who has died after the arousal of Samyaktvamohaniya becomes a Kshayik Samyaktvi in a short time. (Although it is said that "Kshayopaśamika Samyaktvi enters the hellish realm only after vomiting Samyaktv," it should not be understood as a contradiction, as it is also said in the Sixth Karma Grantha that a Samyagdristi with the arousal of Samyaktvamohaniya goes to all four realms. However, a being who has aroused Samyaktvamohaniya, etc., prepares to attain Kshayik Samyaktvi, and he is also called Kshayik Samyaktvi.) Therefore, there are 136 natures in the existence of such hellish beings who have aroused Samyaktvamohaniya, compared to other beings. Compared to a single being, there are 135 natures in the existence of a being who has the Tirthankara karma without the existence of the Aharak Chatushk (the four karmas that cause attachment to food).

Those with the presence of the fourfold food-karma but without the presence of the Tirthankara-karma have 138 natures. However, those without the presence of the Tirthankara-karma and the fourfold food-karma have 134 natures. _The sevenfold vision of the _kshaayik_ samyak-tva, _abirat_ samyak-drishti, and the hell-bound beings does not exist in the sevenfold vision, and due to never falling from the fourth _guna-sthana_, they only bind to the human _ayus_. Therefore, the six _ayus_ do not exist for them. Hence, except for the aforementioned natures, the _ank_ beings have 136 natures for the _purva-baddha-ayushk_ and 138 natures for the _abaddha-ayushk_. If the beings without the presence of the Tirthankara-karma are _purva-baddha-ayushk_, they have 138 natures, and if they are _abaddha-ayushk_, they have 137 natures. If they have the presence of the Tirthankara-karma, they have 135 natures for the _purva-baddha-ayushk_ without the fourfold food-karma and 134 natures for the _abaddha-ayushk_. If they do not have the five natures of the Tirthankara-karma and the fourfold food-karma, they have 134 natures for the _purva-baddha-ayushk_ and 133 natures for the _abaddha-ayushk_.

**Tiryanch-gati:** The beings of this _gati_ do not have the presence of the Tirthankara-karma. Therefore, compared to the _anek_ beings with _upsham_ samyak-tva, the _purva-baddha-ayushk_ have 147 natures, the _ayus_ binder of another _gati_ has 145 natures compared to one being, the _abaddha-ayushk_ and the _ayus_ binder of the same _gati_ have 144 natures. If they do not have the presence of the fourfold food-karma, then instead of 147, 145, and 144, they have 143, 141, and 140 natures respectively.

Samyaktv attained by Tiryanchas is Samyaktv, but not the Samyaktv of the श्रेणी.

**1:**

* **Kshayopaśamika Samyaktv:**  For Tiryanchas, there are 147 types of existence compared to the previous lifespan of many beings. If a being has a lifespan bound to another गति, there are 135 types of existence. For those who bind the lifespan of that गति and those who are unbound, there are 144 types of existence. If the four types of आहारक are not present, then there are 133, 141, and 140 types of existence instead of 147, 145, and 144 respectively. If मिध्यात्व and मिश्रमोहनीय are not present, there are 138 types of existence.

* **Kshayika Samyaktv:**  For Kshayika Samyaktv, there are 130 types of existence out of the aforementioned 138 types, excluding Samyaktvamoha. These beings bind only the lifespan of देवायु. If the four types of आहारक are absent, there are 134 and 133 types of existence instead of 138 and 137 respectively.

* **Manushya-Gati-Upasham Samyaktv:**  The types of existence for this Samyaktv are the same as mentioned earlier, but the 148 types of existence for the unbound are mentioned in relation to all four गतिs. When considering only the Manushya-Gati, there are 145 types of existence. Similarly, one should understand the specific types of existence for Kshayopaśamika and Kshayika Samyaktv. The types of existence for other गतिs should be understood in the same way.

* **Vaivagati:**  The types of existence in this गति should be understood in the same way as in Naraka-Gati. However, there are five more types of existence compared to the विसंयोजक: 142, 141, 140, 136, and 138.

Thus, in the fourth गुणस्थान, there are 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, ...

##  Chapter 154: Appendix to Karma

**136, 147, 101.142, 143, 144, 145, 106, 147, and 148** - these sixteen *satta* variations should be understood.

**(5) *Deshaviriti* Gunasthan:**  Similar to the fourth *gunasthan*, this *gunasthan* also has sixteen *satta* variations. However, the distinction is that this *gunasthan* is only experienced by beings in the *tiryanch* and *manushya* realms. Therefore, wherever *satta* is mentioned in the context of *abaddhayuk*, and all four *ayu* *satta* are considered, only *tiryanchayu* and *manushyayu* - these two *ayu* should be considered.

For example, many beings with *avirat samyagdristi*, *purvabaddhayusk*, *upsham*, or *kshayopshamic*, *avisayojaka* are considered to have *satta* of 148 *prakritis*. However, in this *gunasthan*, since there is no *narak* realm or *dev* realm, these two realms are not present. Therefore, *satta* of 146 *prakritis* should be understood. And since *tiryanchayu* of *kshayik samyagdristi* is also not present, *satta* of 138 *prakritis* should be understood.

Similar to the fourth *gunasthan*, these beings in the *tiryanch* realm are *kshayopshamic samyagdristi*. However, beings who have attained this realm after shedding *mithyatvamohaniya* and *misra mohaniya* do not have the *satta* they have reduced. This is because such beings are born in *tiryanch* with an immeasurable lifespan and do not attain the fifth *gunasthan* nor do they experience *kshayik samyaktva*. Therefore, the *satta* of *kshayik samyaktva* should not be considered here. Here, only the *satta* related to *upsham*, *kshayopshamic*, *avisanyojaka*, and *visayojaka* should be understood.

**(6) *Pramattasanyata* Gunasthan:** Here too, 148, 147, 146, 145, ...

144, 143, 142, 141, 140, 139, 138, 137, 136, 135, 134, and 133, these sixteen **sattastana** can be present, and this **gunasthan** is only for humans. Therefore, wherever the existence of 148 is mentioned in relation to many beings with **abjnayushk** as their **ashraya**, there one should understand the existence of 145 **prakritis**. All other **sattastana** should be understood according to the existence of **prakritis** mentioned in the fourth **avirata samyagdristi gunasthan**.

(7) **Aparamatta Gunasthan** - In this **gunasthan**, similar to the sixth **paramatta samyata gunasthan**, there are sixteen **sattastana**: 148, 147, 146, 145, 144, 143, 142, 141, 140, 139, 138, 137, 136, 135, 134, and 133.

(E) **Apuurvakaran Gunasthan** - Humans, **tiyancha**, and beings bound to **narakayu** and **kshayopamik samyagdristi** do not exist in this **gunasthan**. This **gunasthan** generally has three types:
(1) **Upshama samyaktivi**, beings in the **upshama shreni**. (2) **Kshayik samyaktivi**, beings in the **upshama shreni**. (3) **Kshayik samyaktivi**, beings in the **kshapka shreni**.

Among these, the existence of **prakritis** is mentioned in relation to **upshama samyaktivi** beings in the **upshama shreni**.

These beings are of two types: (1) those who fall from the **shreni** and (2) those who maintain the **shreni**. However, there is no specific difference in their existence, and both are of two types: **avisanjojak** and **visanjojak**.

Except for the bound *devāyu* and the *udayamāna* *manuṣyāyu*, the remaining two *āyu*s, in the case of a single being, have 146 *prakṛti*s, and in the case of an *abaddhāyuṣka*, the *sadbhāva* (in terms of existing reality, towards 145, if *āyubandha* is possible, then with that *āyu*) has 145 *prakṛti*s. In terms of existing reality, for multiple beings, if the *āyu* of another *gati* is bound, then it has 146 *prakṛti*s, and if the *āyu* of the same *gati* is bound, then it has 145 *prakṛti*s. Among them, those beings who are without the *tīrthankara* *nāmakarma*, have 147, 145, and 144 *prakṛti*s in place of 148, 146, and 145 respectively. If they have the *hārakacatuṣka*, then they have 144, 142, and 141 *prakṛti*s in place of 148, 146, and 145 respectively. And those beings who are without the *tīrthankara* *nāmakarma* and the *āhārakacatuṣka* - these five *prakṛti*s - have 143, 141, and 140 *prakṛti*s in place of 148, 146, and 145 respectively.

**Disconnector:** Here too, understand the *sattā* as mentioned above, but reduce the *ananta* *anubandhī* *caturṣka*. That is, where 145, 147, 146, 145, 144, 143, 142, 141, and 140 *prakṛti*s are mentioned, in their place, one should say that there are 144, 143, 142, 145, 140, 138, 138, 137, and 136 *prakṛti*s. The *sattā* of beings who fall from the *śreṇī* should also be understood in the same way.

If one attains **Kshayik Samyaktv** in a particular birth, then **Moksha** is attained in that very birth. Therefore, there is no possibility of **Satta** (existence) in this case.

If **Tirthankara Namakarm** does not exist, then as mentioned earlier, instead of 136 and 138, there will be 137 and 537 in the sequence. And if **Aharak Chatushk** does not exist, then instead of 133 and 138, there will be 135 and 134. And if **Tirthankara Namakarm** and **Aharak Chatushk** - these five **Prakritis** do not exist, then instead of 136 and 138, there will be 134 and 136 **Prakritis** in existence.

(3) **Kshayik Samyaktv** beings with **Kshapak Shreni** are always **Avaddhayusk** (having a fixed lifespan). Therefore, without **Darshan Saptak** and **Dev**, **Niyant** and **Narakayu** - these ten **Prakritis**, there will be 138 **Prakritis** in existence. And for beings without **Tirthankara Namakarm**, there will be 137 **Prakritis** in existence. And for beings without **Aharak Chatushk**, there will be 134 **Prakritis** in existence. And for beings without **Tirthankara Namakarm** and **Aharak Chatushk** - these five **Prakritis**, there will be 133 **Prakritis** in existence.

Thus, in the eighth **Gunasthan**, there are sixteen **Satta Sthan** (places of existence): 148, 147, 146, 145, 144, 143, 142, 141, 140, 139, 138, 137, 136, 135, 134, and 133.

(E) For **Anivritti Bavar Samparay Gunasthan** with **Upsham Shreni**, the sixteen **Satta Sthan** are the same as mentioned earlier for **Upmam** and **Kshayik Samyaktv**: 148, 147, 146, 145, 144, 143, 142, 141, 140, 139, 138, 137, 136, 135, 134, and 133.

For **Kshayik** with **Kshapak Shreni**, the sixteen **Satta Sthan** are also the same as mentioned earlier: 139, 138, 137, 136, 135, 134, and 133. However, when **Apratyaakhyana Avaran Chatushk** and **Pratyaakhyana Avaran Chatushk** - these eight **Prakritis** are destroyed, then instead of the aforementioned four, ...

**Karma Pariśiṣṭa**

There are 130, 126, 126, and 125 **Prakṛtis** in existence, according to the order. Out of these, (1) **sthāvara**, (2) **sūkṣma**, (3) **tiyanc-gati**, (4) **tiyanc-anupūrvi**, (5) **narak-gati**, (6) **narak-anupūrvi**, (7) **ātapa**, (8) **udyota**, (9) **nidrā-nidrā**, (10) **pracalā-pracalā**, (11) **styāna-ddhi**, (12) **eka-indriya**, (13) **d-indriya**, (14) **śrī-indriya**, (15) **tūri-indriya**, and (16) **sādhāraṇa** - these sixteen **Prakṛtis** exist when combined, resulting in 114, 143, 110, and 106 **Prakṛtis** in existence.

Subsequently, generally, when the **napuṁsaka-veda** decays, instead of the aforementioned existing states, 113, 112, 106, and 108 **Prakṛtis** remain in existence. Out of these, when the **strī-veda** decays, 112, 111, 108, and 107 **Prakṛtis** remain. Out of these, when the six **Prakṛtis** of **hāsa**, **rati**, **arati**, **śoka**, **bhaya**, and **jugupsā** decay, 106, 105, 102, and 101 **Prakṛtis** remain. And later, when the **puruṣa-veda** decays, 105, 104, 101, and 100 **Prakṛtis** remain in existence.

Considering the **śreṇī-prasthāpanā** (establishment of order), (1) **napuṁsaka-vedī śreṇī-prasthāpaka** - if the **strī-veda** and **napuṁsaka-veda** decay at the same time, and the **puruṣa-veda** and the six **Prakṛtis** of **hāsa** etc. decay at the same time, then when the **napuṁsaka-veda** decays, 113, 112, 106, and 108 **Prakṛtis** exist. When the six **Prakṛtis** of **hāsa** etc. decay, the alternative existence of 106, 105, 102, and 101 **Prakṛtis** does not occur, but the alternative existence of 113 etc. occurring elsewhere is possible. However, the existence of 106 **Prakṛtis** does not occur for any other reason for the **napuṁsaka-vedī kṣapaka śreṇī-prasthāpaka**. Therefore, this alternative is completely prohibited for him.

These four options with 105, 102 and 101 natures are not possible. The option of 106 is not possible according to the aforementioned method. But other options can be possible in other places.
(3)  **Purushavedi श्रेणी प्रस्थापक** - They are **Sanasthan** as mentioned above. Generally speaking in a relevant way, now we consider it specifically.
It has been said earlier that when **Purushaved** decays, the options of 105, 104, 101 and 100 natures remain. Out of them, when **Sanjwalan Krodh** decays, there are these four options of 104, 103, 100 and 66 natures. Out of them, when **Sanjwalan Man** decays, there are these four options of 103, 102, 66 and 65. After this, with the decay of **Sanjwalan Maya**, the beginning of the tenth **Gunasthan** occurs.

Thus, for **Kshapak**, there are 366, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 125, 126, 127, 130, 132, 134, 137 and 138 - a total of 25 **Sattastahan**.

At the end of this **Guṇasthāna**, the **Sanjvalana Lobha** also gets destroyed. Then the twelfth **Guṇasthāna** begins.

Thus, in the tenth **Guṇasthāna**, there are a total of twenty **Sattā-Sthāna** from 101, 102, and 133 to 148. The one who performs **Kṣapaka-Śreṇī** directly attains the tenth **Guṇasthāna** to the twelfth **Guṇasthāna**.

There are four options, and from the destruction of fourteen natures in them, there are eight sattva-sthana (states of being) with four options: 80, 81, 84, and 85, in the 13th guna-sthana (state of merit).

It should be understood that for those with the four types of aahara (food) and tirthankara-nama-karma (karma related to becoming a Tirthankara), there are 85 sattvas. If there is no tirthankara-nama-karma, there are 84 sattvas. If there are no four types of aahara, there are 81 sattvas. And if there are no tirthankara-nama-karma and four types of aahara, a total of five natures, then there are 80 sattvas. Thus, in this guna-sthana, there are four sattva options with 80, 81, 84, and 85 natures.

**(14) Aayogika-kevali-guna-sthana:** In this guna-sthana, until the end of the two extremes (dvicarama), there are four sattva-sthana with 80, 81, 84, and 85 natures. After this, for those with 85 sattvas, the destruction of any one, all, or some of the following 72 natures leads to the remaining 13 natures: devagati (heavenly path), devānupūrvi (heavenly lineage), śubhavihāyoga (auspicious path), aśubhavihāyoga (inauspicious path), two gandha (smells), eight sparśa (touches), five varṇa (colors), five rasa (tastes), five śarīra (bodies), five bandha (bonds), five saṃghātan (aggregations), nirmāṇa (creation), six saṃhanana (solidifications), asthira (unstable), aśubha (inauspicious), durbhaga (unfortunate), duḥsvara (bad voice), anādeya (unworthy of respect), ayaśa kīrti (bad reputation), six saṃsthāna (establishments), aguru-caturṣka (four types of aguru), aparyāpta (insufficient), sāta-asāta-vedanīya (painful and painless), sthira (stable), śubha (auspicious), audārika-vaikriya (worldly transformation), āhārak-aṅgopāṅga (food-related limbs), susvara (good voice), and nīca-gotra (low lineage).

According to another view, the destruction of 73 natures, including manuşyānupūrvi (human lineage), leaves 12 natures.

For those without tirthankara-nama-karma, the destruction of 12 natures leaves 12 natures.

According to another view, the destruction of 73 natures, including manuşyānupūrvi, leaves 11 natures.

The essence of the **karma** (karmic) **parishista** (appendix) is that according to the author's view, there are 12 and 13 **prakritis** (karmic substances) and according to other views, there are 12 and 11 **prakritis**. If the **aaharaka-chaturshka** (four types of food) are not present in the **satta** (existence), then 68 **prakritis** are destroyed. Because the previously mentioned 72 **prakritis** include the **aaharaka-chaturshka**, and the **aaharaka-chaturshka** are not present in the **satta** of this being, therefore only 68 **prakritis** are destroyed. 

Therefore, from the **prakritis** of **manushya-gati** (human path), **panchendriya-jati** (five-sense beings), **sa** (being), **badar** (bad karma), **paryapta** (sufficient), **subhaga** (auspicious), **aadeya** (worthy of being given), **yasha-kiriti** (fame and reputation), **tirthankara-namakarma** (karma of becoming a Tirthankara), **uchcha-gotra** (high lineage), **manushya-ayu** (human lifespan), **manushya-anupurvi** (human lineage), and **sata-asata-vedaniya** (karmas that produce pleasant and unpleasant experiences), one of these thirteen **prakritis** remains, and according to other views, twelve **prakritis** remain without **manushya-anupurvi**. 

However, for those who do not have **tirthankara-namakarma** and **aaharaka-chaturshka** in their **satta**, 68 **prakritis** are destroyed. But twelve **prakritis** remain without **tirthankara-namakarma**. According to other views, eleven **prakritis** remain without **manushya-anupurvi**.

Thus, according to the author's view, 12 and 13 **prakritis** have **satta-sthan** (place of existence), and according to other views, 11 and 12 **prakritis** have **satta-sthan**, and 80, 81, 84, and 85 - these six **satta-sthan** are in the fourteenth **guna-sthan** (stage of spiritual progress). 

After that, in the final time, all the remaining **prakritis** are destroyed, and after leaving the **karman-sharira** (karmic body) which has an eternal connection, they become free from birth and death and reside in **moksha** (liberation) for an infinite time.

Thus, the description of the existence of **karma-prakritis** in the fourteen **guna-sthan** is complete. For more information, see the **satta-yantra** (chart of existence) provided alongside.

**Kalaganan** (Time Calculation): In the **janavrishti** (rain of beings) scriptures, the time indicators are **kal** (time), **avali** (period), **ghadi** (hour), **muhurta** (auspicious time), **palyopam** (moment), ...

## Second Karma Granth: Appendix

The terms "Appendix" and "Adi" are used in their original places. This indicates that time is not just a moment, but a continuously changing flow. Modern scientists also consider time to be a flow and have reached an understanding of its many subtle aspects. However, the Agamas have elaborated on the existence of many subtle aspects within these subtle aspects, proving its infinity.

This discussion is presented briefly for the benefit of the inquisitive. For detailed information, one should refer to texts like Jambudvipaprajnapti and other scriptures and works written by the Acharyas.

Jain philosophy defines the group of six substances, including Jiva, as Lok. Time is one of these six substances. Just as the characteristics, distinctions, and other aspects of the other substances like Jiva are described in the most subtle way, so is time.

Firstly, while explaining the substance of time, it is stated that the substance which acts upon the Jiva and Ajiva substances and helps in changing their new, old, and other states, is called time. Although Dharma and other substances are inherently inclined to produce their new states, these states do not occur without an external cooperative cause, and that cooperative cause is the substance of time. The above characteristic of the substance of time is evident from the literal meaning of the word "time" itself.

"Kalyate, Kshipyate, Prayate Yena Kriyavad Dravyam Sa Kaalah." The substance which causes the active substance to "Kalyate" (be influenced), "Kshipyate" (be thrown), "Prayate" (be motivated), is the substance of time. This substance of time itself does not undergo transformation. (Raj Va. 414222:12)

Page #199:
---------------------------
## Karmastava Parishishta: 164

And one does not transform into another form, meaning it does not transform other substances by being a motivator, but time is the cause for substances to attain various kinds of transformations on their own. Now the question arises: Does time exist? How can we know this? The answer is that time, cooking, etc., are given their own specific names like time, cooking, etc., while also being attributed the name of time in the form of time, kala, pakakala, etc. And from this name, the existence of the primary time is known.

This time substance is innumerable, and the primary time is in the form of existence. Thus, based on the primary time, the secondary time of practical usage is known in the form of hours, minutes, days, nights, fortnights, months, etc. And through these, the primary time in the form of transformation is known. This primary time exists in the form of one atom on each region of the lokaakasha. There are innumerable regions of the lokaakasha. Therefore, there are also innumerable time atoms. The most subtle part of practical time is called time, meaning time is the focal point of time calculation, and after that, we know about nimisha, ghadi, day-night, etc. The cause of the origin of these times, etc., is the celestial deities like Surya-Chandra, etc., who constantly circumambulate Meru in this human world. Due to their movement, day-night, etc., occur in the human world.

The most subtle part of the time substance is called time, and the definition of time is that when the time atom is situated on a particular region of space, when that region of space is crossed by the pudgala atoms at a slow speed,

Page #200:
---------------------------
## Second Karma Granth: Appendix

**165.** When a karmic particle reaches another region, the time it takes to traverse that region is equal to the amount of time that has passed, which is a subtle manifestation of the time substance. This time is a synonym for the time aspect of the time substance.

**The Division of Practical Time:** The most subtle unit of practical time is **time**. All other subsequent units of time are calculated from this **time**. This calculation is as follows:

* There are countless **avali** (avali-ka) of **time**.
* 256 avali-ka make one **kshullkabhava** (the smallest lifespan).
* 17 **kshullkabhava** (which are equal to 4446 avali-ka) make one **pranashvasochchhvas** (breath).
* 7 **pranashvasochchhvas** make one **stoka**.
* 7 **stoka** make one **lava**.
* 38.5 **lava** make one **ghadi** (hour).
* 2 **ghadi** make one **muhurta**.
* 30 **muhurta** make one **din-ratri** (day and night).

* One **muhurta** contains 65,536 **kshullkabhava** and 16,777,216 **avali-ka**.
* After one **din-ratri**, 15 **din-ratri** make one **paksha** (fortnight).
* 2 **paksha** make one **mas** (month).
* 2 **mas** make one **ritu** (season).
* 3 **ritu** make one **ayana** (six months).
* 2 **ayana** make one **varsha** (year).
* 5 **varsha** make one **yuga** (epoch).
* 2 **yuga** make one **varsha-dashak** (decade of years).
* And in subsequent time periods after the **varsha-dashak**, the time is multiplied by 10.

**1.** According to modern time calculations, the value of **uchchhvas**, **stoka**, and **lava** can be expressed as follows:

* 1 **avali** = 1 second
* 1 **uchchhvas** = 7 seconds
* 1 **stoka** = 7 **uchchhvas** = 35 seconds
* 1 **lava** = 7 **stoka** = 245 seconds
* 1 **ghadi** = 38.5 **lava** = 24 minutes

## Karmastathra: Parishishta

When performing calculations, numbers like hundred, thousand, lakh, crore, arab, kharab, etc. are used, which are commonly known. In Jain time mathematics, to calculate time beyond common knowledge, terms like Purvaang, Purva, Trutitaang, Trut, etc. are mentioned, and the final term is "Shirsha Prahelika". 

One Purvaang consists of 84 lakh years, and multiplying 84 lakh by 84 lakh gives the value of one Purva, which is 70 lakh crore years. Multiplying this 28 times results in 54 digits with 140 zeros, which is called "Shirsha Prahelika". Here, the limit of mathematical numbers ends, and the time beyond this is explained through metaphors like "Palyopam" and "Sagaropama".

## Explanation of Palyopam and Sagaropama

Palyopam and Sagaropama have been discussed in detail in the scriptures. Curious individuals should refer to the relevant sections of the scriptures for specific knowledge. Here, we are only providing a brief indication.

The scriptures explain the time measurement of Palyopam and Sagaropama through examples. The example is as follows:

A well four kos (one yojana) long, wide, and deep is filled by dividing the countless strands of hair of the Devakuru and Uttar Kuru couples, who live for seven days, into countless pieces and burying them in the well. 

(a) The concept of time is collected in the Jambudvipa Pannaatti Kalaadhikari.
(b) Anuyogadwar 138 to 140.
(c) Pravachana Sarodwar-Dwar 158, Gaya 1018-1026.

Page #202:

## Second Karma Granth: Appendix
167

Chunks cannot fly in the air and the well becomes packed. Then, one by one after every hundred, chunks go to the friend. When the well becomes empty as the chunks leave, that is one **Palyopam** time (which takes countless years). And ten **Kodakodi** (multiplying 10 crore by one crore) **Palyopam** makes one **Sagropam**. Ten **Kodakodi** **Sagropam** makes one **Avasarpini** time, and the same amount of time, i.e., ten **Kodakodi** **Sagropam**, makes one **Utsarpini** time. Together, they make one **Kalchakra** of twenty **Kodakodi** **Sagropam**. This happens only in the Bharat and Airavat regions. There are infinite **Kalchakras** in one **Pudgal Paravartan**. In other words, it can be called infinite time.

There are three types of **Palyopam** and **Sagropam**: **Uddhar**, **Adha**, and **Kshetra**. These three types are further divided into two types each, based on **Vyavahar** and **Sookshma**, making a total of six types. The **Adha** type of islands and oceans is used to count the substances in **Dristivad** based on the differences in **Karma Sthiti** etc.

**Time** can be **Sankhyat**, **Asankhyat**, and **Anant**
**Uddhar** and **Kshetra**

1. Time is infinite in the form of **Pudgal Paravartan**, and it is also **Sankhyat** and **Asankhyat**. Generally, what can be counted is **Sankhyat**, what is beyond count is **Asankhyat**, and what has no end is **Anant**. Among these, **Sankhyat** time is finite. **Asankhyat** is also finite, but even though it is being spent, it never ends. Therefore, the difference between **Asankhyat** and **Anant** is that the amount that ends when one by one number is subtracted, i.e., the amount that is exhausted, is **Asankhyat**. And...

Page #203:
---------------------------
## 165
**Appendix**

That which has no end, that which does not finish, is called infinite.

The distinctions between countable, uncountable, and infinite, and their explanations should be understood as follows:

There are three types of countable: **jghannya**, **madhyama**, and **utkrista**. 'One' is not a count. It is the nature of the object. Therefore, the count that begins with two is called counting, meaning there is one number, but the count begins with two, such as two, three, four, etc. In this count, two is called **jghannya sankhyata** and the numbers from three to one less than **utkrista** are called **madhyama sankhyata**.

The nature of **utkrista sankhyata** is as follows: Imagine three wells (**palyas**) with a circumference equal to the circumference of Jambudvipa. That is, the circumference of each **paly** is three lakh sixteen thousand two hundred twenty-seven yojanas, three kos, 128 dhanush, and slightly more than thirteen and a half angulas. Each has a length and width of one lakh yojanas. The depth is one thousand yojanas, and the height is equal to the vedika of Jambudvipa (eight yojanas). The names of these three **palyas** are **shalaka**, **prati-shalaka**, and **maha-shalaka**, respectively.

First, imagine filling the **shalaka paly** completely with mustard seeds. Then, imagine a person taking one seed and dropping it into Jambudvipa, one seed into the salt ocean, and so on, dropping one seed into each island and ocean. When the mustard seeds are exhausted in a particular island or ocean, a vast, uncountable **paly** is created. Then, fill this **paly** with mustard seeds and drop one seed into the **shalaka paly**, and then continue dropping seeds into the islands and oceans in the same way as before. In this way, imagine vast, uncountable **palyas**...

## Second Karmagramya: Appendix

And while placing one grain at a time into the *Shalaka Palya*, when the *Shalaka Palya* is filled to the point where it cannot hold even one more grain, and the *Anvastthit Palya* is also completely full, then place one grain from the *Shalaka Palya* into the *PratiShalaka Palya* and then continue placing grains into the subsequent islands and oceans. When the *Shalaka Palya* is empty, then again, imagine new *Anvastthit Palya* of progressively larger sizes and fill them in the same manner. When they are full, place one grain into the *PratiShalaka Palya* and empty the remaining grains into the island oceans. In this way, fill the *Shalaka Palya* from the *Anvastthit* and the *PratiShalaka Palya* from the *Anvastthit Shalaka*.

After filling the *PratiShalaka Palya*, place one grain into the *MahaShalaka Palya* and empty the *PratiShalaka Palya* into the island oceans using the previous method. When all four *Palya* are completely filled by filling the *MahaShalaka* from the *Anvastthit Shalaka*, the *PratiShalaka* from the *Anvastthit Shalaka*, and the *MahaShalaka* from the *Anvastthit Shalaka* and *PratiShalaka*, then make a pile of these mustard seeds. If one grain is removed from this pile, then it is considered an *Utkrushta Sankhyat*.

There are nine types of *Asankhyat*:

1. If one grain is added to the aforementioned *Utkrushta Sankhyat*, then it is the first type of *Asankhyat* called *Jghanya Parita Sankhyat*.
2. The number between the first and third types of *Asankhyat* is the second type of *Asankhyat* called *Madhyama Parita Sankhyat*.
3. The number of grains in the first type of *Asankhyat* is...

Page #205:
---------------------------
## 170
**Appendix**

**3. Utkrushta Parita Sankhyat:**  The third type of Asankhyat is called Utkrushta Parita Sankhyat. It is obtained by multiplying the individual heaps of a number with each other (Anyonyabhyas) and then subtracting one grain from the resulting number.

**4. Jghanya Yukta Sankhyat:**  The fourth type of Asankhyat is called Jghanya Yukta Sankhyat. It is obtained by adding one grain to the amount of the third type of Asankhyat. There are this many Asankhyat moments in one Aavali.

**5. Madhyama Yukta Sankhyat:**  The number between the fourth and sixth types of Asankhyat is called Madhyama Yukta Sankhyat.

**6. Utkrushta Yukta Sankhyat:**  The sixth type of Asankhyat is called Utkrushta Yukta Sankhyat. It is obtained by multiplying the amount of mustard seeds in the fourth type of Asankhyat with each other and then subtracting one grain from the resulting number.

**7. Jghanya Sankhyata Sankhyat:**  The seventh type of Asankhyat is called Jghanya Sankhyata Sankhyat. It is obtained by adding one grain to the amount of mustard seeds in the sixth type of Asankhyat.

**8. Madhyama Sankhyata Sankhyat:**  The number between the seventh and ninth types of Asankhyat is called Madhyama Sankhyata Sankhyat.

**9. Utkrushta Sankhyata Sankhyat:**  The ninth type of Asankhyat is called Utkrushta Sankhyata Sankhyat. It is obtained by multiplying the amount of mustard seeds in the seventh type of Asankhyat with each other and then subtracting one grain from the resulting number.

**10. Difference between Anyonyabhyas and Multiplication:**  When you multiply five by five, the result is 5 x 5 = 25. However, when you perform Anyonyabhyas, the result is 3125. This is because in Anyonyabhyas, you first establish five fives (5-5-5-5-5) and then multiply them with each other. For example, 5 x 5 = 25, 25 x 5 = 125, 125 x 5 = 625, 625 x 5 = 3125.

Page #206:
---------------------------
## Second Karma Granth: Appendix
171

The eight types of infinity are as follows:

1. **Jghanya Paritaananta:** The first type of infinity is obtained by adding one to the number of the ninth type of Asankhyata.
2. **Madhyama Paritaananta:** The number between the first and third types of infinity is called Madhyama Paritaananta.
3. **Utkrisht Paritaananta:** The third type of infinity is obtained by subtracting one from the number obtained by multiplying the number of the first type of infinity by itself.
4. **Jghanya Yuktaananta:** The fourth type of infinity is obtained by adding one to the number of the third type of infinity.
5. **Madhyama Yuktaananta:** The number between the fourth and sixth types of infinity is called Madhyama Yuktaananta.
6. **Utkrisht Yuktaananta:** The sixth type of infinity is obtained by subtracting one from the number obtained by multiplying the number of the fourth type of infinity by itself.
7. **Jghanyaanananta:** The seventh type of infinity is obtained by adding one to the number of the sixth type of infinity.
8. **Madhyamaanananta:** All numbers beyond Jghanyaanananta are called the eighth type of infinity, Madhyamaanananta.

These eight types are according to the Agamas. Some Acharyas have considered "Utkrishtanananta" as the ninth type, but it is debatable as it is not supported by the Agamas.

1. Multiply the numbers of the seventh type of infinity three times and then add the following six infinite things:

**Karmastava: Parishista**
**Pudgalparavartan: Lakshana and Meva**

It has been previously indicated that the time in the form of Pudgalparavartan is infinite. This infinite is equal to the infinite Utsarpini and the infinite Avasarpini. Therefore, some special descriptions are given here in relation to it! This Lok is filled with many types of Pudgal Varganas. These Varganas are both grahanyogya (grasp-able) and agrahanayogya (ungrasp-able). While the agrahanayogya Varganas exist but are not grasped, the grahanyogya Varganas have both the ability to be grasped and ungrasped. Such grahanyogya Varganas are of eight types:

1. Audarik Sharia Vargana, 2. Vaikriya Sharia Vargana, 3. Aharak Sharia Vargana, 4. Tejas Sharia Vargana, 5. Bhasha Vargana, 6. Pravasouchchvas Vargana, 7. Manova Vargana, 8. Karman Vargana.

These Varganas are increasingly subtle from the least to the most. And their comprehension is also increasingly less, in the measure of countless parts of a finger.

Out of the above mentioned grahanyogya Varganas, excluding the Aharak Sharia Vargana, 1. Siddha, 2. Nigoda Jisha, 3. Every ordinary plant, 4. Past, future, present, time of all three periods, 5. All Pudgal Paramanu, 6. Alokaakash. After combining these six, the amount obtained is multiplied three times, and if only knowledge and only vision are added as synonyms, then it will be called Utkrishtaanantanant.

The act of a living being touching all the pudgalas of the entire lokaakasha, while consuming the material substances in the form of the remaining audarika and other types, is called pudgalparavartan.

An infinite number of kalachakra pass in one mudgaparnal. One kalachakra is equal to 20 kotakoti samaropama, in comparison to adhapatyopama.

There are four main types of pudgalparavartan:

1. Dravya pudgalparavartan
2. Kshetra pudgalparavartan
3. Kal pudgalparavartan
4. Bhav pudgalparavartan

And each of these four has two types: baadar and sukshma. Thus, there are eight types of pudgalparavartan:

1. Baadar dravya pudgalparavartan
2. Sukshma dravya pudgalparavartan
3. Baadar kshetra pudgalparavartan
4. Sukshma kshetra pudgalparavartan
5. Baadar kal pudgalparavartan
6. Sukshma kal pudgalparavartan
7. Baadar bhav pudgalparavartan
8. Sukshma bhav pudgalparavartan

The explanation of these eight types is as follows:

1. **Baadar Dravya Pudgalparavartan:** The time taken by a living being to consume all the atoms residing in the entire loka, in all seven varganas except the aharakashariravrgana, in the form of the remaining audarikasarira and other types.

**Note:** Digambara Acharyas consider bhav paravartan as an additional type of pudgalparavartan, apart from these four. Bhav paravartan is the journey of a living being from the smallest lifespan in hell to the lifespan of a vevak vimana, taking the shortest possible time.

Page #209:

## Translation:

**174**
When a soul abandons all the atoms of the universe, after having transformed them into all seven categories, including Audarik, that period is called **Badar Dravya Pudgal Paravartan**. In essence, every atom in the universe undergoes transformation through the seven categories, starting with Audarik. When a soul acquires all the atoms of the universe in the form of Audarik and other categories, a Badar Dravya Pudgal Paravartan occurs.

**Appendix:**

**2. Sukshma Dravya Pudgal Paravartan:** When a soul, over time, acquires all the atoms in the form of any one category, including Audarik, and then abandons them, that period is called **Sukshma Dravya Pudgal Paravartan**. This means that when a soul transforms all the atoms of the universe into the Audarik form, if it acquires Vayik Pudgal in between, that period is not counted. Only the acquisition of atoms transformed into the Audarik form is considered. The same understanding applies to other categories like Vaishrir, etc.

**3. Badar Kshetra Pudgal Paravartan:** When a soul, upon death, touches all the regions of the Lokakasha (universe) in sequence or without sequence, in the same order as they are formed, that period is called **Badar Kshetra Pudgal Paravartan**. If a soul dies in a region and then dies again in the same region, it is not counted. Only those regions where death has not occurred before are counted. Although a soul resides in countless regions, one region can be considered as the main one for counting.

**4. Sukshma Kshetra Pudgal Paravartan:** When a soul, while wandering in the universe, dies in one region of the sky and then dies again in another region adjacent to it, and then again in another region adjacent to that, it is called **Sukshma Kshetra Pudgal Paravartan**.

Page #210:

## Second Karma Granth: Appendix
175

**3. Subtle Region Pudgala Paravartan:** When a being dies in an infinite number of regions, one after another, and eventually dies in all the regions of the Lokakasha, it is called Subtle Region Pudgala Paravartan. The difference between Badar and Subtle Region Pudgala Paravartan is that in Badar, the order of the regions is not considered, while in Subtle, the order of the regions is considered.

**5. Badar Kala Pudgala Paravartan:** When a being touches each moment of a Kalachakra, which is equal to countless oceans, in order or out of order, through its death, it is called Badar Kala Pudgala Paravartan. If the being dies a second time in the same moment, it is not counted. Thus, when the being touches each moment of the Kalachakra, Badar Kala Pudgala Paravartan is complete.

**6. Subtle Kala Pudgala Paravartan:** When a being touches each moment of the Kalachakra in order through death, it is called Subtle Kala Pudgala Paravartan. If the moments are touched out of order, it is not considered. For example, if the first moment is touched and then the third moment is touched, it will not be counted. In other words, touching the moments of the Kalachakra in a sequential manner, and touching all the moments of the Kalachakra, is Subtle Kala Pudgala Paravartan.

**7. Badar Bhava Pudgala Paravartan:** When a being touches all the Kshaya Sthanas, due to the cause of Anubhagabandh, through its death, i.e., when it dies once in all the results of Mand, Mandatar, etc., it is called Badar Bhava Pudgala Paravartan.

**8. Subtle Bhava Pudgala Paravartan:** Due to the cause of Anubhagabandh...

Page #211:
---------------------------
The **Kashaya** (passions) of the **Parishista** (auxiliary) **Karma** (karmic particles) touch the **Jiva** (soul) in a sequential manner. This means that if a **Kashaya** touches a particular **Bhava** (state of mind) and then touches another **Bhava**, it is not counted. However, if it touches a different **Parinama** (manifestation) of the same **Bhava**, it is counted. In this way, the **Jiva** touches all the **Parinamas** of each **Bhava** sequentially. When the **Jiva** has touched all the **Bhavas**, the **Sukshma** (subtle) **Pudgala Paravartan** (transformation of matter) is complete.

The eight **Bhedas** (divisions) mentioned above are only for explaining the **Sukshma Paravartanas**. When **Shastras** (scriptures) refer to the time of **Pudgala Paravartan**, it is the **Sukshma Pudgala Paravartan** that should be considered. For example, after attaining **Samyaktvam** (perfect knowledge), the **Jiva** attains **Moksha** (liberation) within the **Deshon** (space) and **Ardha Pudgala Paravartan** (half transformation of matter). Here, the time is considered as **Sukshma Pudgala Paravartan**.

Thus, **Jain** literature presents a very subtle, profound, and insightful analysis of time. Due to **Apeksha Bheda** (differences in perspective), time can be calculated as **Bhoot** (past), **Vartaman** (present), **Bhavishya** (future), **Sankhyat** (countable), **Asankhyat** (uncountable), **Anant** (infinite), etc. However, these divisions do not affect its **Anantata** (infinity). Therefore, **Lok** (universe), **Jiva**, etc. are considered **Anadi-Anant** (beginningless and endless) in relation to time. The **Lok** has existed since **Anadikal** (beginningless time) and will continue to exist for **Anantkal** (endless time). The **Samsari Jiva** (worldly soul) residing in this **Lok** attains **Moksha** after destroying the **Anant Samsar** (endless cycle of birth and death) upon attaining **Samyaktvam**.

**Comparative Viewpoint**
(**Svetambar** and **Digambar** beliefs generally consider **Karma** as **Bandha** (binding), **Uday** (arising), **Udirana** (excitation), and **Satta** (existence) in nature)

Regarding the number and qualities of the places, the karma-related blindness, etc., in the Marganas, there is a general similarity in the subject matter of the karma literature written by the theoreticians, karma-text writers, and the Svetambara-Digambara Acharyas. There are some differences, which are worthy of study and contemplation regarding the subject of karma, and therefore we are presenting some points here.
;
Characteristics of Gunasthan
In Svetambara texts, Gunasthan is explained as "the state of the being of a living being due to the increase or decrease in the purity and impurity of knowledge, etc., is called Gunasthan." However, in Digambara texts, Gunasthan is explained as follows: "The state of the living beings is known from the feelings that arise at the time of the arising, etc., of the Darshanamohaniya and Charitramohaniya, therefore those feelings are called Gunasthan." - Gommatasar Jivakand Ga. 8
In the Agamas, the word Jivasthan is used for the word Gunasthan. The word Gunasthan has been used in karma texts and other texts written by Acharyas after the Agamas. In the Dhavala Tika of the Shatkhandagama, the word "Jivasamas" is used for Gunasthan, and the reason for this is explained by saying that the living being resides in the qualities, therefore it is called Jivasamas.
In Digambara literature (Go. Jivakand, Ga. 622), the living beings have been divided into two categories, namely, punya and papa, according to the order of Gunasthan. The Mithyatvi or Mithyatvounmukhi living beings are called Papajivas and the Samyaktva living beings are called Punyajivas.

## Translation:

178
There are 11 types of **Parigishta Desha Chirat** (long-lasting karmic matter) mentioned in Digambara literature (Go. Jeevakanda, verse 476). These are: (1) **Darshan** (perception), (2) **Vrat** (vow), (3) **Samayik** (meditation), (4) **Proshad** (purification), (5) **Sachitta Virati** (cessation of mental activity), (6) **Ratribhojan Virati** (cessation of night-time meals), (7) **Brahmacharya** (celibacy), (8) **Aarambha Virati** (cessation of initiation), (9) **Parigraha Virati** (cessation of possessions), (10) **Anumati Virati** (cessation of permission), (11) **Uddishta Virati** (cessation of intention). The term "Proshad" is used here instead of "Poushad" which is prevalent in the Svetambara sect.

Svetambara and Digambara **karmagranthakars** (authors of karma texts) have considered the **bandhyogya prakritis** (karmic substances capable of binding) to be the same in the **gunasthanas** (stages of spiritual progress). However, Digambara texts (Go. Karmakanda) mention 56 **prakritis** (karmic substances) in the seventh **gunasthan** - **Aprammatta Virata gunasthan** (stage of perfect non-attachment), while Svetambara karmagranthakars mention 58 or 56 **prakritis** for binding. This difference is explained by stating that those souls who begin the binding of **devaayu** (karmic matter related to the senses) in the sixth **gunasthan** and attain the seventh **gunasthan** without ending the binding in the sixth **gunasthan**, have 56 **prakritis** capable of binding. On the other hand, those souls who begin and end the binding of **devaayu** in the sixth **gunasthan** have 58 **prakritis** capable of binding. (See the explanation of **Vishesh Ma. 7, 8**).

Svetambara and Digambara karmagranths consider the **uday** (emergence) and **udirana** (activation) of **prakritis** in the **gunasthanas** to be the same. However, this similarity is found according to the opinion of **Bhutbali Acharya** as mentioned in the Digambara text Go. Karmakanda, verse 264. In the same text (verse 263), the opinion of **Yativrishabha Acharya** is mentioned, which differs in some aspects. **Yativrishabha Acharya** believes in the emergence of 112 **prakritis** in the first **gunasthan** and 13 **prakritis** in the fourteenth **gunasthan**. The karmagranth mentions the emergence of 117 **prakritis** in the first **gunasthan** and 12 **prakritis** in the fourteenth **gunasthan**.

Second Karmagrantha Appendix
176
In the seventh and earlier Gunasthanas, the Vedaniya Karma does not arise, therefore, in these Gunasthanas, the Ahar Sanjna is not considered in the Digambar literature (Go. Jeevakanda Ga. 138). However, there is no objection to considering the said Sanjna in the said Gunasthanas because other causes such as the arising of Asata Vedaniya are possible in those Gunasthanas.

In the Karmagrantha, in the second Gunasthana, except for the Tirthankara Nama Karma, the existence of 147 Prakṛtis is considered. However, in the Digambar Grantha (Go. Karmakanda), except for the Aharakadvik and Tirthankara Nama Karma, the existence of 145 Prakṛtis is considered. Similarly, according to Go. Karmakanda Ga. 333-336, in the fifth Gunasthana, the present Jiva does not have the existence of Naraka, and in the sixth and seventh Gunasthanas, the existence of Rahu and Tiryanchayu is not considered. Therefore, according to that Grantha, in the fifth Gunasthana, the existence of 147 is considered, and in the sixth and seventh Gunasthanas, the existence of 146 is considered. However, according to the Karmagrantha, in the fifth Gunasthana, the existence of Narakayu is possible, and in the sixth and seventh Gunasthanas, the existence of Narakayu and Tiryanchayu is also possible.

Therefore, subtracting the remaining two Ayus (Manushyayu, Devayu)
27 Prakrutis are reduced. 4. Aviratasampadristi Mula 8

The arising and cessation of the four natures of samyak-tva-mohaniya, ardhanārācha-kīlikā, sevārta-sanhanana occurs at the end of the seventh guna-sthāna, therefore it is not possible for these four to arise in this guna-sthāna. Therefore, it is possible for the 76-4-72 natures to arise!

A being who has bound the *Jinanama karma* due to the *parishista vala* of *karmastava* will inevitably experience *sampartava* when going to hell, but the *Tirthankara nama karma* exists in the *gunasthan*. Therefore, there are 148 *prakritis* in this *gunasthan*.

(In terms of eligibility) 2. *Sasvadan* root 8
Ex. 147 No being can attain the *Sasvadan gunasthan* by binding the *Tirthankara nama karma*, therefore it does not have the *Jinanama karma* in other *gunasthanas*. 3. *Mishra* root
