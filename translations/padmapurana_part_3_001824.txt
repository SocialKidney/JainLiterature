In the Jain tradition, Maryadapurushotam Ram is considered one of the 63 Shalaka Purushas. One of his names was also Padma. This name is more prevalent in Jain Puranas and Charitakavyas. Jain poets have presented Ram's character in various languages like Prakrit, Sanskrit, Apabhramsha, etc., under names like Paumachariyam, Paumachariyu, Padma Purana, Padmacharit, etc. Acharya Ravishena's (7th century) present work, Padma Purana, is considered one of the most excellent character-based epic poems in Sanskrit. Even though it is a Purana, this poem is so amazing in terms of poetic art, psychoanalysis, character portrayal, etc., that it cannot be compared to any other Purana poem. The poetic elegance in it is so much that this poetic stream, emanating from the mental snow-capped mountains as the poet's inner voice, has become like the Mandakini itself. From the point of view of the subject matter, the poet has depicted the Vidhyadharaloka, Anjana-Pavananjay, Hanuman, Sukoshal, etc., along with the main plot, which has increased the interest of the book so much that one does not want to leave it in the middle once they start reading it. This book, edited and translated into Hindi by Dr. (Pandit) Pannalal Jain Sahityacharya with a preface, appendix, etc., has been published in three parts by Bharatiya Gyanpeeth. This is another new edition of the book, keeping in mind the expectation and need of scholars, researchers, and self-study lovers.

Ministers like Mrganga try to convince Ravana that it is best to return Sita and make peace with Rama. Ravana agrees to their suggestion in front of the ministers, but secretly instructs the messenger to convey a different message. The messenger reaches Rama's court and praises Ravana, suggesting that Rama should let go of Ravana's brothers and sons. Rama replies that he doesn't need the kingdom and will wander in the forest with Sita, while Ravana can enjoy the earth. The messenger again supports Ravana's side. Seeing this, Bhamandal gets angry and prepares to kill the messenger, but Lakshmana calms him down. The messenger returns and informs Ravana of everything.

## Padma Purana

When people sought advice from Ramachandraji on this matter, he clearly stated that how could it be right to commit such a misdeed against someone who has taken vows and is seated in a Jain temple.  "Rama is a great soul, he will not indulge in unrighteousness,"  convinced of this, the Vidhyadhar king himself did not go, but he sent his sons to Lanka to cause trouble. The sons created havoc in Lanka, causing the Lankans to be terrified and seek refuge in Ravana, who was seated in the Jain temple. However, Ravana was engrossed in meditation. The people were terrified, so the presiding deities of the Jain temple, through their power of reaction, stopped the sons. On the other hand, in Ramachandraji's camp, the presiding deities of the Jain temples fought with the presiding deities of Ravana's peaceful Jain temples, trying to stop them. Subsequently, two Yaksha kings named Purnabhadra and Manibhadra, came to Ravana's aid, stopped the sons, drove them away, and rebuked Ramachandraji for their misdeeds. Sugriva explained the truth and calmed them down by performing an Aryaavataran.  Later, at Lakshmana's request, both Yakshas agreed that they would not cause any harm to the city dwellers, but would try to distract Ravana from his meditation.

**16-23**

**Seventy-first Chapter** Seeing the Yaksha kings calmed, Angad became eager to see Lanka. Skanda, Neel, and other sons joined him. All these sons entered Lanka. Seeing Angad's beauty, the women of Lanka were stirred. The sons entered Ravana's palace. The magnificent splendor of the palace amazed them. They all worshipped the Jina in the peaceful Jain temple. Ravana was demonstrating his knowledge while seated in the half-lotus posture in front of Shantinath Bhagwan. Even when Angad caused various disturbances, Ravana did not deviate from his meditation, and at that very moment, he mastered the art of transformation. Seeing Ravana master the art, Angad and others flew back to Ramachandraji's army through the sky.

**24-30**

**Seventy-second Chapter** Ravana's eighteen thousand wives, having been harassed by Angad, went to Ravana and expressed their grief. Ravana comforted them. The next day, Ravana entered the pleasure garden with great joy. The Vidhyadharis, seated near Sita, tried to attract her towards Ravana. Seeing Ravana's strength, Sita lamented her misfortune. Ravana wanted to attract Sita towards him with fear and affection, but Sita said to Ravana, "O Dashaanan! Before you shoot arrows in the battle, tell Rama this message from me: without you, the sister of the universe has died a slow death..." and fainted. Seeing the strong bond of love between Sita and Rama, Ravana regretted his actions, but due to the excitement of the battle, his regret vanished, and he firmly decided to fight.

**31-38**

**Seventy-third Chapter** The sun rose. Ravana's council of ministers was perplexed by his stubbornness. The queen Mandodari also...

Consoling them, they perform Ravana's funeral rites with sandalwood and other fragrant substances and then proceed to the Padma Sarovar.

At that time, Narada descends from the sky and approaches her, inquiring about the reason for her lament. Kausalya explains everything, and Narada, filled with sorrow, sets out to bring news of Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita's well-being. Upon reaching Lanka, Narada informs them about the grief of Kausalya and Sumitra. Hearing about their mothers' sorrow, Rama and Lakshmana become eager to return to Ayodhya, but Vibhishana, bowing his head at their feet, requests them to stay for another sixteen days.

Rama and Lakshmana tried to dissuade him, and Kaikeyi cried and screamed, but nothing had any effect on him. Rama, Lakshmana, and Bharata's wives tried to hold him back by tempting him with worldly pleasures, but they failed. Meanwhile, the Trilokamandan elephant goes berserk and creates havoc in the city.

Everyone tried their best to prevent him from taking initiation, but Hanuman did not deviate from his goal and took initiation from the Muni named Dharmaratna and finally attained liberation from the mountain called Nirvāṇagiri.
360-363  _ The one hundred and fourteenth chapter  _ Upon hearing the news of the initiation of Lakshman's eight sons and Hanuman, Shri Rama laughs and says, "Oh! What enjoyments did these people have?" Saudharmendra, while preaching Dharma to the gods in his assembly, says that the bond of affection is the strongest bond among all bonds, and it is not easy to break.
364-368 The one hundred and fifteenth chapter describes two gods coming to Ayodhya from heaven to test the bond of affection between Rama and Lakshman. They pretend to cry falsely and tell Lakshman that "Rama has died." Upon hearing this, Lakshman's body became lifeless. There was a commotion in the inner palace. Rama ran, but Lakshman's departed soul did not return. The gods repented their actions and went back. Due to this incident, Lava and Ankaś renounced the world and became initiated.
366-373 The one hundred and sixteenth chapter describes Rama carrying Lakshman's lifeless body in his lap and wandering around. He cries in sorrow like a madman.
374-377 The one hundred and seventeenth chapter describes Sugriva, Vibhīṣaṇa, etc. coming to Ayodhya upon hearing the news of Lakshman's death and consoling Rama by describing the state of the world.

## Padma Purana

**One Hundred and Eighteenth Chapter:** Sugriva, etc., and Lakshmana inspire the cremation of Lakshmana, but Rama, angered by them, takes Lakshmana and leaves for another place. Rama bathes Lakshmana's body, tries to feed him, and adorns him with sandalwood paste, etc. In this state, some enemy kings from the south advise an attack on Ayodhya and arrive with a large army. But the former friend of Rama, the commander Krtaantavaktra, and the soul of Jatayu, who had become a god in heaven, come and destroy this disturbance. Having removed the enemy disturbance, both of them address Rama in various ways, due to which Rama cremates Lakshmana's body after six months.

**One Hundred and Nineteenth Chapter:** Rama, detached from the world, wants to give the kingdom to Shatrughna, but he refuses to take it.

**One Hundred and Twenty-Second Chapter:** Rama is absorbed in penance. The soul of Sita, Achyuta, the king of heaven, knowing from his divine knowledge that Rama is about to attain liberation from this very birth, tries to distract him out of affection. But all his efforts are in vain. The great sage Rama attains the क्षपकश्रेणी (Ksapkashreni) and becomes a Kevali.

**One Hundred and Twenty-Third Chapter:** The soul of Sita, Pratindra, goes to hell and addresses the soul of Lakshmana. He gives him religious instruction. He is saddened by his suffering and tries to get him out of hell, but all his efforts are in vain. ... After getting out of hell, he goes to the shelter of the Kevali Rama and asks him where the soul of Dasharatha was born? What is the state of the Bhamandala? What will happen to Lakshmana, Ravana, etc. in the future? He asks all this. The Kevali Rama answers him through his divine voice. The Kevali Rama attains Nirvana. ... In the end, the author, Ravishenacharya, writes his own praise.

The Padma Purana, also known as the Pacharita, composed by the venerable Acharya Shrimad Ravishena, Chapter 66.

**Verse 1:**
Hearing the news of Lakshmana's recovery, as befitting the character of Vishalya, Ravana was filled with both wonder and envy.

**Verse 2:**
He smiled faintly and asked, "What harm is there?" Then, he turned to his ministers, skilled in mantras, like Mrigaanka.

**Verse 3:**
"O Lord," they said, "I speak the truth and what is beneficial to you. Whether you are pleased or displeased, it is the duty of servants to offer fearless advice for your benefit."

**Verse 4:**
"O Lord, you have seen that Rama and Lakshmana, through the power of their virtuous deeds, have effortlessly obtained the knowledge of the lion-borne and Garuda-borne celestial vehicles."

**Verse 5:**
"You have also seen that their brother, Kumbhakarna, and their two sons are bound, and the divine power of the most powerful celestial being has been rendered useless."

**Verse 6:**
"Even if you conquer your enemy, know for certain that the destruction of your brothers and sons is inevitable."

**Verse 7:**

In the Padma Purana,
Having said this, the aged ministers, with their hands folded in salutation, bowed their heads.  Seeing their confusion, Dashaanan (Ravana) raised them up and said, "I will do as you say."  ||11||
Then, the ministers, who were well-versed in mantras, were pleased and instructed a very handsome and wise Samanta (minister) to be the messenger.  ||12||
Ravana, recognizing the messenger's intelligence and ability to understand subtle hints, quickly conveyed his message through gestures.  ||13||
The message given by the ministers, though beautiful, was corrupted by Ravana's intentions, just as poison contaminates a great medicine.  ||14||
Then, the Samanta, who was as wise as Shukracharya, possessed great strength and prowess, was a kingmaker, and skilled in pleasing speech, bowed to his master, pleased, and prepared to depart.  He, with his sharp intellect, saw all beings as insignificant as the dust under a cow's foot.  ||15-16||
As he departed, a fearsome army, adorned with various weapons, and seemingly created by his intellect, followed him without fear.  ||17||
Hearing the sound of the messenger's trumpet, the Vanara (monkey) soldiers were agitated and, fearing Ravana's arrival, looked up at the sky.  ||18||
When the messenger drew near, and it was understood that he was not Ravana but a mere human, the Vanara army regained their composure.  ||19||
The messenger, having been informed by the gatekeeper of Videha, and having stationed his soldiers outside the camp, arrived with a few close associates.  ||20||
Seeing Padma, he bowed, performed the duties of a messenger, and, standing for a moment, spoke in a measured tone.  ||21||
He said, "O Padma! My master, Ravana, speaks to you through my words. Please make an effort to listen attentively for a moment."  ||22||
"He says that he has no need for war in this matter. Many men, proud of war, have met their destruction."  ||23|| 

Page #21:
---------------------------
## The Sixty-Sixth Chapter

**24.**  The destruction of people is the result of war, not the attainment of any good fortune.  The greatest fault is failure in war, and even if victory is achieved, it is always accompanied by many drawbacks.

**25.**  Those who were driven by the desire for war, like Duvritta, Naraka, Shankha, Dhavalanga, and Shambara, have all perished.

**26.**  It is in your best interest to be friendly with me.  Just as a lion finds happiness in a cave, so too will you find happiness in our friendship.

**27.**  He who, in battle, terrified the gods, even Indra, the king of the gods, and imprisoned him in a cell fit for a common criminal.

**28.**  He whose movement is at his will, in the netherworld, on earth, and in the sky, and whom even the angry gods and demons cannot defeat.

**29.**  I, Ravana, the ten-headed one, who has captured the goddess of fortune in many great battles, have you never heard of me?

**30.**  O King, I give you this entire earth, extending to the ocean, along with the Vidyadharas, and I also give you half of Lanka.

**31.**  Today, send my brother and sons with a good heart, and agree to give me Sita.  This will bring you prosperity.

**32.**  If you do not do this, how can you expect to prosper?  Sita is already in our possession, and we will forcibly take back our brothers and sons who are bound in battle.

**33.**  Padmanabha then said, "I have no desire for your kingdom, nor for other women or great pleasures."

**34.**  "O ten-headed one, if you send Sita back to me with the utmost respect, I will send your brother and both your sons immediately."

**35.**  "With Sita by my side, I will wander happily in the forest, a place frequented by deer and other animals.  You, however, may enjoy the entire earth."

**36.**  "O messenger, go and tell the lord of Lanka this.  This is the only path to his well-being, there is no other way."

**37.**  Hearing these words of Padmanabha, which were praised by all and spoken with grace, the messenger, the king's minister, spoke.

**38.**  "O King, you have crossed the terrible ocean without fear, and you have come here to do a great good deed.  Why are you afraid?" 

Page #22:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
Your hope for Janaki is not at all auspicious. Even if you were to be in the company of the king of Lanka, give up all hope for your life. ||36||
A wise man should always protect himself, even from his wives and wealth. ||40||
Even if the lord of the Garuda has sent you two vehicles, or if you have bound my sons and brothers by deceit, what is this inflated ego of yours? Because while I am alive, you will not achieve your goal. ||41-42||
If you strive in battle, you will neither get Sita nor will your life remain. Therefore, do not be corrupted on both sides, give up your stubbornness regarding Sita. ||43||
In all the scriptures, I have caused the death of great celestial kings like Indra. ||44||
Look at these piles of bones, like the peaks of Kailasa, of the kings who have been destroyed by the strength of my arms. ||45||
Thus, when the messenger spoke, the radiant sun, illuminating the sky with the brilliance of his face, spoke in anger, "Oh, wicked messenger! Oh, jackal! Skilled in fabricating words! Oh, foolish one! Why are you babbling like this without any fear?" ||46-47||
What is the talk about Sita? Who is this vile demon Ravana, like a beast, who is engaged in vile deeds, to slander Rama? ||48||
As soon as the sun said this, he drew his sword, but Lakshmana, the keeper of the eyes of righteousness, stopped him. ||46||
The sun's eyes, which were like red lotus petals, became corrupted by anger and took on the form of twilight - they became red like twilight. ||50||
Just as a great serpent, manifesting the brilliance of its venom, is pacified by a mantra, so too was the sun gradually pacified by the good advice of his ministers. ||51||
The ministers said, "Oh, king! Give up your anger, which has arisen in an inappropriate matter. Even if this messenger is killed, what is the purpose?" 

Page #23:
---------------------------
## The Sixty-Sixth Chapter

The wise, who is skilled in crushing elephants with the force of the monsoon clouds, does not get agitated by a mouse, even if it has moving whiskers.  ||53||

What anger can a righteous person have towards echoes, wooden puppets, birds like parrots, or mechanical human figures?  ||54||

Thus, being spoken to by Lakshmana, the son of Janaka, became calm.  Then, the fearless messenger, free from fear, spoke to Padma again.  ||55||

You are being misled by these foolish and wicked ministers, who are entangled in evil practices and are full of doubts.  ||56||

Understand that you are being deceived by them and, with your own wise intellect, consider what is beneficial for you.  ||57||

Abandon your association with Sita, become the lord of all the worlds, and, riding the Pushpaka chariot, adorned with wealth, roam freely as you please.  ||58||

Give up your false pride, do not listen to the words of petty people, and focus your mind on what needs to be done.  You will become supremely happy.  ||59||

Thinking, "Who will answer this petty person?", Janaka remained silent, but others severely rebuked the messenger.  ||60||

Pierced by sharp words like arrows and subjected to utter disrespect, the messenger, deeply distressed, went to his master.  ||61||

There, he reported, "O Lord! Following your command and guided by your influence, I spoke to Rama in a manner consistent with the principles of diplomacy.  ||62||

I offered you the earth, filled with diverse kingdoms, rich in precious mines, and adorned with celestial dancers, along with mighty elephants, horses, chariots, and the Pushpaka chariot, which even the gods cannot despise.  ||63|| 

Page #24:
---------------------------
I offer you three thousand beautiful maidens along with their retinue, a throne that shines like the sun, and an umbrella that resembles the moon. Or what more can be said on this matter? If Sita accepts me by your command, then enjoy this entire, thornless kingdom. ||62-66||

O wise one! If you do what we say, we will be content with a simple mat made of reeds and a meager livelihood. ||67||

Although I repeatedly said these words to him, he does not abandon his stubborn attachment to Sita. His devotion lies solely in her. ||68||

Just as the conduct of a truly peaceful sage is dear, so too is Sita dear to Rama. O master! Forget about your kingdom, even if you offered the three worlds, no one could separate that beautiful woman from him. ||69||

And Rama said to you, "O Dashaanan! It is not fitting for you to engage in such an act condemned by all." ||70||

Why haven't the tongues of you, a wicked and lowly man, been torn into a hundred pieces for speaking in this manner? ||71||

I have no need for the pleasures of Indra without Sita. You may enjoy the entire earth, and I will dwell in the forest. ||72||

If you are determined to die for the sake of another man's wife, then why shouldn't I strive for my own beloved? ||73||

O beautiful one! Enjoy all the maidens in the world. I, who eat fruits and leaves, will wander only with Sita. ||74||

The messenger continues to speak to Ravana, "My lord! Sugriva, the king of the monkeys, mocked you and said that your master seems to be under the control of some demon." ||75||

Or perhaps your master is afflicted by a very strong wind, which causes him to speak nonsense. This is the reason why he is behaving so strangely. ||76||

It seems that there are no skilled physicians or spellcasters in Lanka, otherwise they would surely have treated him with remedies like heated oil and other wind-expelling substances. ||77||

Or perhaps Lakshmana, the physician of poisons, will quickly cure all his ailments with arrows in the battlefield, which is like a circle. ||78||

Then, my heart, burning with anger at his insults, will become like a lion, and the eight monkey-bannered moons will become like eight lions. ||79|| 

Page #25:
---------------------------
## The Sixty-Sixth Chapter

**Sughreeva!** You surely wish to die by the pride of your heart. You are insulting the lord of the Vidyadharas in anger. ||80|| Viradhit has also told you, if you have the strength, come, fight me alone. Why are you sitting? ||81|| I told Dasharatha's son again, "O Rama! Have you not seen Ravana's supreme valor in the battlefield?" ||82|| You wish to bring him to his senses, who is like the sun to the fireflies that are the kings, who is a hero, whose fame is known throughout the three worlds, who is currently merciful due to your auspicious influence, who is generous, and who loves the humble. ||83-84|| Do you wish to swim across the ocean that is Ravana, who is filled with waves of fierce armies and a multitude of weapons like aquatic creatures? ||85|| How do you intend to enter the impenetrable forest of Ravana, which is filled with ferocious beasts and dense trees of foot soldiers? ||86||

**The Lineage**

The Sumeru mountain is not lifted by the wind, the ocean does not dry up by the rays of the sun, the earth does not tremble by the horns of the bull, and Ravana is not conquered by those like you. ||87||

**The Sub-Lineage**

While I was speaking thus, Bhamandala, with eyes red with anger, was about to draw his shining sword, but he was stopped by Lakshmana, the son of Sumitra. ||88|| Lakshmana said to Bhamandala, "O son of Videha! Calm down, a lion does not get angry at a jackal, he plays with a string of pearls by tearing the chest of an elephant." ||89||

**The King**

Those who possess great strength and valor do not attack the fearful, the Brahmanas, the ascetics, the unarmed, the women, the children, the animals, or the messengers. ||90||

Thus, I rebuked him in the same way a dog rebukes an elephant. ||76|| 

Page #26:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, when the wise Lakshmana, adorned with auspicious qualities, gently reasoned with him, the one who bore the unbearable wheel of brilliance, gradually relinquished his anger. ||11||

The wicked Kumaras, filled with malice, scorned him with words like thunderbolts. His soul, crushed by unprecedented causes, considered itself as insignificant as a blade of grass. ||12||

Driven by fear, I ascended to the sky and have returned to your feet. O God! If Lakshmana had not been there, I would have surely perished at the hands of Bhammandala. ||13||

O God! I have recounted the character of the enemy as I have experienced it, without any hesitation. Do what is right, for we, like me, are only those who follow orders. ||14||

Gautama Swami says, O Shrenik! Even those who are well-versed in many groups of scriptures, who are always engaged in matters of ethics, and who have good ministers by their side, become subject to delusion when they are enveloped by the dense clouds of delusion of the sun-like man. ||15||

Thus ends the sixty-sixth chapter of the Padma Purana, known as Ravana's Messenger's Arrival and Departure, narrated by the sage Ravishena. ||66||

And they do not attack the messenger. ||60|| 

Page #27:
---------------------------
The sixty-seventh chapter: Hearing the words of his messenger, the lord of the Rakshasas, after a moment's deliberation with his ministers, the wise men, placed his hand on his cheek, shining with the light of his earrings, and sat down with his face downcast, lost in thought.  If I win the battle against the enemy, who are united like a herd of elephants, then the loss of the Kumaras is evident. Therefore, when the enemy force is asleep, I should attack them secretly and bring back the Kumaras. Or what should I do? What will bring about my welfare?  Thus, while he was pondering, this thought arose in the mind of the king of Magadha, making his heart happy. I will attain the great knowledge, known as Bahurupi, which even the gods, who are always vigilant, cannot obstruct.  Thinking thus, he quickly summoned his servants and commanded them: "Quickly, decorate the peaceful abode with beautiful toranas and other ornaments. And perform the worship of the Jina in all the temples, equipped with all the necessary paraphernalia. He entrusted the entire responsibility of the arrangements for the worship to Mandodari, who was of a noble mind.  The time of the great rise of the Lord Munisuvrata, worshipped by gods and demons, had arrived. At that time, this vast land of Bharat was adorned with the holy images of the Arhant.  The kings, the rulers of the land, and the wealthy merchants, erected magnificent Jina temples, shining brightly.  These temples were presided over by the righteous gods of the kingdom, who were devoted to the protection of the righteous path and were auspicious.  The people of the land, always prosperous, performed abhisheka and worship in them, and the glorious beings always worshipped them. These Jina temples were as beautiful as the celestial chariots of heaven.  O King! At that time, on every mountain, in every beautiful village, in every forest, in every port, in every city, in every town,

Padmapurana
In villages, forests, towns, cities, palaces, and cities, at every confluence and beautiful intersection, there were Jain temples adorned with great splendor. || 14-15 || These temples were radiant like the autumn moon, melodious with the sound of music, and resonated with the sound of the ocean, stirred by the sounds of various musical instruments. || 16 || These temples were filled with groups of virtuous people eager to offer prayers at all three times of the day, were profound, accompanied by various teachers, and adorned with offerings of various flowers. || 17 || They were endowed with supreme splendor, glittering with the brilliance of jewels of various colors, very spacious, tall, and adorned with large flags. || 18 || In these temples, there were statues of the Jinas made of gold, silver, and other materials, adorned with five colors, and accompanied by their families. || 19 || The peak of Mount Vijayardha was adorned with the beautiful Jain temples built in the city of the Vidyadharas at every location. || 20 || This entire world was filled with auspicious and beautiful Jain temples, adorned with gardens, made of various jewels, and was extremely beautiful. || 21 || Lanka, like the city of Indra, was also extremely beautiful, both inside and outside, with Jain temples that destroyed sins. || 22 ||
Gautama Swami says that Dasanana, whose radiance was like that of a rain cloud, whose arms were long like an elephant's trunk, whose face was like the full moon, whose lips were red like the midday flower, who was himself beautiful, whose eyes were large, whose movements were captivating to women's hearts, whose form was like that of Lakshmīdhara-Lakshmana, and who was endowed with a divine form, played with his eighteen thousand wives, who were like lotuses, like the sun. || 23-25 || In the house of Dasanana, which was surrounded by a row of other palaces, made of various jewels, and adorned with chaityas, and on which the eyes of all people were fixed, there was a peaceful house in the middle, which was spacious, radiant, and adorned with thousands of golden pillars, where the peaceful Jina, the Lord of Peace, was established. || 26 ||

**The Praise of the Tri-Lokeshwaras**

**Verse 27:**
Blessed are those who, knowing all things to be impermanent, fix their minds firmly on Dharma and build magnificent temples for the Jinas in this world. Their temples are adorned with the brilliance of the Jinas, whose feet shine brighter than the gems adorning the crowns of the Indras.

**The Story of the Up-Caste**

**Verse 28:**
Wise men say that the fruit of wealth is the attainment of merit. Jain Dharma is the supreme treasure in this entire world, illuminating the desired object like the sun.

**Thus ends the Sixty-Seventh Chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the "Shanti Griha Kirtan," narrated by Acharya Ravishena.**

**Note:**

* The text refers to the "Shanti Griha Kirtan," which is a section within the Padma Purana.
* The term "Tri-Lokeshwaras" refers to the Jinas, who are the masters of the three worlds (heaven, earth, and hell).
* The term "Up-Caste" is a translation of "Up-Jati," which refers to a higher social class.

The eighth festival of the sixty-four festivals, the Nandishvara Ashtahnika, began on the eighth day of the bright fortnight of the month of Phalguna and continued till the full moon. ||1|| Upon the arrival of this Nandishvara festival, people from both sides of the army, filled with utmost joy, became eager to observe the vows. ||2|| All the soldiers thought in their minds that these eight days are extremely sacred in all the three worlds. ||3|| We will not engage in war during these days, nor will we commit any other kind of violence, but will remain devoted to our own welfare and worship the Jina as much as we can. ||4|| During these days, even the gods abstain from enjoyment and, along with the Indras, remain devoted to the worship of the Jina. ||5|| Devotees, with golden pitchers filled with the water of the ocean of milk and adorned with lotuses, perform the abhisheka of the Jina. ||6|| Others should also perform the abhisheka of the Jina with unmatched images, made of leaves, etc., if pitchers are not available, with devotion. ||7|| If the Indras, going to the Nandishvara island, worship the Jina with devotion, then are the Jinas not worthy of worship by the lowly humans residing here? ||8|| If the gods worship the Jinas with jewels and golden lotuses, then the poor humans on earth should also worship them with the lotus of the mind, if nothing else. ||9|| Thus, the people who had attained meditation, adorned the beautiful temples in the Lanka island with flags, etc., with great enthusiasm. ||10|| Magnificent assemblies, water-fountains, platforms, scripture halls, beautiful drama halls, and large gardens were constructed. ||11|| Many beautiful lakes, adorned with lotuses, were shining with excellent steps and whose banks were adorned with temples made of cloth, etc. ||12|| The temples were adorned with various kinds of mandalas made of gold dust, etc., and with excellent doors decorated with cloth, banana trees, etc. ||13|| The pitchers, filled with ghee, milk, etc., had lotuses covering their mouths, and were adorned with jewels and rays of light. ||14||

The Eighty-sixth Festival

Hundreds and thousands of kalashas, adorned with strings of pearls, shining with the radiance of gems, and decorated with various ornaments, were seen in the homes of the householders, gathered for the abhisheka of the Jina images. [14-15]

In the temples, garlands made of Karnikar, Ati-muktak, Kadamba, Sahakar, Champaka, Parijataka, and Mandara flowers, all born in the Nandana forest, were adorned, their fragrance attracting swarms of bees. [16-17]

The Sri Jinendra Deva was worshipped with excellent offerings of lotuses made of gold, silver, and gems. [18]

The temples resounded with the loud sounds of excellent drums, trumpets, mridanga, conch shells, and other instruments. [19]

The Lankans, their mutual animosity extinguished and united in great joy, manifested the supreme glory of the Jinendra Deva. [20]

Just as the Devas in Nandishvara Dvipa, eager to worship the Jina images, manifest great glory, so too did the Vidyaadharas, devoted to devotion, manifest great glory. [21]

Ravana, the great hero, went to the Shanti Jin-alaya and, becoming pure, performed a beautiful worship of the Sri Jinendra Deva, just as Bali Raja had done before, with devotion. [22]

Gautama Swami says, "Who is capable of describing the accumulation of merit of those men who, endowed with appropriate wealth and bearing the burden of excellent devotion, worship the Sri Jinendra Deva?" [23]

Such beings, enjoying the wealth of the Devas, obtaining the good fortune of the Chakravarti's enjoyments, and finally performing austerities greater than the Sun, attain the supreme liberation, following the Jain path. [24]

Thus ends the Eighty-sixth Festival, which describes the glory of the Ashtahnika of the Phalguna month, as narrated by the Acharya Ravishena in the Padma Purana, known as the Aarsha. [18]

The 76th chapter. Hail to Shantinath, whose abode is the cause of peace. It is like the peak of Mount Kailash, resembling a cluster of autumn clouds. (1) It is self-luminous, divine, surrounded by a row of palaces, and situated in the middle of Jambudvipa, like Mount Meru. (2) With a mind filled with the means of knowledge, and with firm determination, Ravana entered and performed a most wonderful worship of Shantinath. (3) With abhishekas, musical instruments, very beautiful garlands, incense, offerings of food, and unguents of excellent color, (4) the ten-headed Ravana, with a peaceful mind, performed the worship of Shantinath with great splendor, like a dog eager for a bone. (5) With a crown of hair adorned with a jewel, a radiant crown, wearing white clothes, with thick arms adorned with bracelets, (6) with folded hands, pressing the earth with his knees, he bowed to Shantinath with three-fold prostration. (7) Standing before peace, on the pure earth, with his limbs arranged on a seat, on a carpet of flowers, (8) holding a rosary of crystal beads in his hand, resembling a cluster of blue clouds with rows of lightning, (9) with concentrated meditation, his eyes fixed on the tip of his nose, the king of the Rakshasas began to seek knowledge. (10) Then Mandodari, who had been instructed by the Lord, ordered her minister named Yamadanda, saying, "Let a proclamation be made everywhere, so that people everywhere may be devoted to the rules and regulations, and may be filled with great compassion." (11-12) Let the worship of the Jina be performed, abandoning all other activities, and let wealth be given to those who ask, without envy, as they desire. (13) As long as the yoga is not completed, let the people remain restrained, being devoted to faith. (14)

Even if someone from a low caste were to insult you, a strong person should definitely endure it. ||15||

Whoever shows anger in these days, even if he is a father, what to speak of others, he will be my enemy. ||16||

Whoever is not a follower of this order, even if he is endowed with knowledge and meditation, will be bound to the endless cycle of birth and death. He will not be liberated. ||17||

Then, saying "As you command," with haste and joy, Mandodari's minister, Yamadanda, announced it. All the people, free from doubt, carried out the order. ||18||

Gautama Swami says that all the people of Lanka, who reside in the most excellent palaces, shining like the sun, and who possess pure and elevated thoughts, abandoned all other activities and became absorbed in the worship of the Jina. ||16||

Thus ends the sixty-seventh chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the Arsha, narrated by Ravishena Acharya, which describes the rules for people. ||66||

This news was heard from the spies. The celestial kings, eager for victory, said: "It is heard that the lord of Lanka, Ravana, has entered the refuge of the Shantinath Jinendra and is engaged in attaining the Bahurupi Vidya." ||19|| This Vidya is attained in twenty-four days and is capable of breaking the pride of even the gods. ||3|| Therefore, before this Vidya is attained by him, go quickly and arouse the anger of Ravana, who is seated in meditation. ||4|| Once this Vidya is attained, he will not be conquered even by the Indras, let alone us, who are insignificant. ||5|| Then Vibhishana said: "If this deed is to be done, then let it be started quickly. Why are you delaying?" ||6|| After deliberation, all the celestial kings said to Rama: "On this occasion, let Lanka be taken." ||7|| Let Ravana be bound and let the desired action be taken. Thus, being told, the valiant Rama, who was engaged in the deeds of great men, said: "Even against those who are extremely fearful, it is not proper to commit violence. How then can it be proper to commit this evil against one who is seated in the temple of the Jina, observing vows?" ||8|| This conduct is not praiseworthy for Kshatriyas who are born in noble families, who are proud and who have practiced the use of weapons. ||10|| Our lord Rama is a great soul and will not engage in unrighteousness. Thus, having decided, they secretly sent their sons towards Lanka. ||11|| Even after deciding, "We will go tomorrow," the celestial kings remained in deliberation for eight days. ||12|| Then, on the day of the full moon, with faces like the full moon, with eyes like lotuses, and adorned with various auspicious marks, they...

The Vidyaadhara Kumaras, adorned with various flags, mounted on chariots drawn by lions, tigers, boars, elephants, and Sharabha, and on Vimanas, proceeded towards Lanka, fearless and with respect. At that time, those monkey Kumaras, bearing the best weapons and filled with the desire to anger Ravana, were shining like the gods who dwell in the celestial mansions. 13-15.

The names of some of the Kumaras are as follows: Makaradhwaja, Satop, Chandraabha, Vaatayan, GuruBhar, SuryaJyoti, MahaRath, PreetiKakar, DridhaRath, SamunnataBala, Nandan, Sarvada, Dusht, Singh, Sarvapriya, Nal, Neel, SagaraNishwan, PurnaChandra with his son, Skanda, ChandraMarichi, Jambavan, Sankat, SamadhiBahul, SinghKati, IndraAshani, and Bala. Each of their chariots was drawn by a hundred horses. 16-16.

The remaining Kumaras, with their supreme valor, proceeded towards Lanka on vehicles resembling lions, boars, elephants, and tigers, as swift as thought, while the foot soldiers stood in their ranks. 20.

Their banners bore various emblems, and they were marked with various toranas. They were adorned with colorful victory flags, and their army, like a vast ocean, filled the sky with its deep roar. They carried themselves with dignity and were extremely exalted. 21-22.

Reaching the outskirts of Lanka, they pondered, "What a wonder! This Lanka is at peace." 23.

The inhabitants of this Lanka appear to be healthy and calm, and their warriors are stationed as if they have never experienced war before. 24.

Oh, the immense courage, the profound composure, and the strength enhanced by Lakshmi and prowess of the Lord of Lanka! 25.

Although the mighty Kumbhakarna, Indrajit, and Meghanada are imprisoned, and many valiant warriors, including Aksha, who were invincible even to the strongest, have been slain in battle, this king does not seem to have any fear. 26-27.

Thinking thus and conversing among themselves, the Kumaras were filled with immense wonder, as if they were apprehensive. 28.

The mighty demon Maya, filled with rage and adorned with armor, quickly set out for battle, accompanied by his armored ministers.  His spirit soared high.  He reached the palace of the king of Lanka, the abode of the glorious Harinakeshi, like the sun.  

Mandodi, his daughter, rebuked him severely, saying, "Father, this is not your duty.  Do not plunge into the ocean of sin."  

"Have you not heard the proclamation of the Jain dharma?  If you desire your own well-being, then be merciful and calm."

Hearing his daughter's words, which were for his own good, the demon king Maya calmed down and restrained his weapons, like the sun retracting its rays.  

Covered in impenetrable armor, adorned with jeweled earrings, and his chest adorned with a necklace, Maya entered his own Jain temple.  

Meanwhile, the princes, resembling surging oceans, arrived, their speed like the wind, stripping the palace of its towers.  

These valiant princes, eager for great destruction, broke through the fortified gates of the tall tower and entered the city.  

As they arrived, the city was filled with cries of "They've come!  Run!  Where shall I go?  Enter your homes!  Alas, mother, what has happened?  Father, father, look!  Good people, save us!  Brother, what, what?  Why, why?  Noble son, return, stay!  Alas, alas, great fear!"  

The city was filled with the terrified cries of its people, overwhelmed by the fear of the ten-headed demon.  

One woman, in her extreme panic, stumbled over her fallen garment, tripped over it with her own foot, and fell to the ground, her knees broken.  

Another woman, her clothes slipping from her grasp, was in a state of utter panic, holding her child close, ready to flee.  

Yet another woman, her large pearls scattered in her haste, was running like a swift cloud, a streak of lightning.  

The sounds of panic and fear echoed throughout the city.  

Page #38:
---------------------------
## Padma Purana

**57.** A woman, like a streak of lightning, was running away, showering a multitude of pearls.

**58.** A woman, with eyes like a frightened deer and hair scattered, clung to her beloved's chest, her trembling subsided.

**59.** Seeing the people terrified, the Deva's of the Shaasana, residing in the Shanti Prasada, were filled with compassion and, determined to protect their own, quickly became doorkeepers, preventing anyone from entering.

**60-63.** Emerging from the Shanti Chaitya, they took on terrifying forms, adorned with various ornaments, their mouths filled with rows of teeth, their eyes like the midday sun, filled with anger and venom, their lips curled, their bodies massive, roaring with various sounds. Their very presence filled the enemy with fear and confusion, causing the monkey army to flee in terror.

**64.** These Deva's could transform into lions, fire, clouds, elephants, serpents, wind, and mountains in an instant.

**65-66.** Seeing the monkey army defeated by the Deva's residing in the Shanti Prasada, the Deva's residing in the Jinalaya, who were concerned for the welfare of the monkeys, also came to the battlefield, transforming themselves into various forms. It is only natural, for the Deva's who reside in their own places are the protectors of those places.

**67.** As the Deva's engaged in a fierce battle, their transformations caused doubt even in the minds of those who were naturally inclined towards truth.

**68-69.** Seeing his own Deva's defeated, the other Deva's powerful, and the arrogant monkeys marching towards Lanka, the supremely powerful and wise Yaksha king, Purnabhadra, addressed the Yaksha, Manibhadra, in a fit of rage.

**70.** "Look at these merciless monkeys, who, despite knowing all the scriptures, have fallen prey to their vices."

Those who are eager to kill the peaceful-hearted, who are engaged in evil deeds, who are small and strike at the weak points, who are devoid of heroic deeds, should be abandoned. ||72||

Then Mani-bhadra, who was like Purna-bhadra, spoke. He said, "The hero who is imbued with the spirit of right conduct, who is a devotee of the feet of the Jina, who is adorned with excellent qualities, who is peaceful and radiant, even Indra could not defeat Ravana. What to speak of these?" ||73-74||

Then, Purna-bhadra, the radiant one, said, "So be it." Thus, the two Yaksha-indras, who were the destroyers of obstacles, were born. ||75||

Seeing the two Yaksha-indras ready for battle, the other gods, filled with shame and fear, went to their respective places. ||76||

The two Yaksha-indras, driven by a great wind, rained down stones, and roared like thunderclouds at the end of an epoch. ||77||

The army of the Vidyadharas, driven by the wind from the thighs of the Yaksha-indras, became like a heap of dry leaves, that is, they fled in fear. ||78||

Chasing after the fleeing monkeys, the two Yaksha-indras came to Rama, intending to rebuke him. ||79||

Purna-bhadra, the wise one, praised Rama, saying, "You are the son of the glorious King Dasharatha. ||80||

You are always free from unworthy deeds and always engaged in good deeds. You have reached the shore of the ocean of scriptures and are elevated by pure qualities. ||81||

O Bhadra! Being so powerful, is it right that your army has destroyed the citizens of the city?" ||82||

"Whoever takes away the wealth earned by another's effort, takes away his life, for wealth is said to be external life." ||83||

"Your people have destroyed Lanka, which is filled with priceless diamonds, sapphires, pearls, and corals, and have made its women distraught." ||84||

Then, Lakshmana, who was like a full-blown blue lotus, who was skilled in all the scriptures, spoke with a powerful voice. ||85||

He said, "This wife of Raghu-chandra, who is a repository of great qualities and adorned with virtue, is more precious than his life. ||86||

That demon, by deceit, took her away. How can you have compassion for Ravana?" ||87||

Padmapurana
What wrong have we done to you, or what good has he done to you? Tell us, O Lord of the Guhyakas, even a tiny bit. ||88|| With a crooked and fierce frown on his forehead, like the red glow of the evening, you are angry, O Lord of the Yakshas, and have come here without any reason. ||86|| Giving him an offering with a golden cup, Sugriva, the king of the monkeys, said, "O Lord of the Yakshas, be pacified!" ||60|| See with equanimity the strength of our army and the state of the ocean of Lanka's army, which has been witnessed by the very Itipanas. ||61|| Even so, the lord of the Rakshasas, Ravana, is still trying. By whom was he ever conquerable before? And now that he has mastered the art of assuming many forms, what can be said? ||12|| Just as those who argue are defeated by the learned in the Jain scriptures, so too are the kings defeated by the enraged Ravana in battle. ||33|| Therefore, I will provoke Ravana, who is sitting calmly, because just as a person with false vision cannot attain Siddhi, so too cannot a common man attain knowledge while he is agitated. ||64|| Our aim in provoking Ravana is to become equal in strength to him, so that we can fight him on equal terms. Otherwise, our battle with him will be unequal. ||65|| Then, Purnabhadra said, "It may be so, but O virtuous one, even a tiny bit of suffering should not be inflicted on Lanka." ||66|| Without causing him any pain, etc., try to provoke him by keeping his body well. But I think Ravana will be very difficult to provoke. ||67|| Saying this, the two lords of the Yakshas, whose eyes were filled with joy, who were affectionate towards the noble ones, who were devoted to the Sangha of the Shramanas, who were always eager to serve them, and who had faces as bright as the moon, praised Rama, saying,

1. Abhi = spear. 2. Kin nu ma. 3. Nadyaapi ma. 4. Evamuktau ma.

**Arya Chanda**

Having received reproach from Lakshmana, those two, Sulājita and Sujita, became greatly ashamed. They sat down with composed minds, free from any activity. || 100 ||

As long as there is freedom from fault, there is great affection from those who are close. Who desires the sun with its eclipses? || 101 ||

Thus ends the Seventieth Chapter of the Padma Purana, known by this name, narrated by the Acharya Ravishena, describing the miraculous powers of the Samyagdrsti Devas. || 70 ||

The Seventy-First Chapter

Knowing the peaceful Yaksha king, the son of the carpenter, Sundara, was extremely eager to see the city of Dasanana.  ||1||  He was mounted on a magnificent elephant named Kishkindhakanda, whose radiance was like that of a great cloud, adorned with pearl garlands, shining with white chowries, and resounding with the sound of great bells. ||2||  He shone like the full moon on the back of a cloud. ||3||  The princes, Skanda, Indra, Nila, and others, all adorned with great wealth, were also eager to go, mounted on horses and other steeds. ||4||  Foot soldiers, countless in number, their bodies anointed with sandalwood, their lips red with betel, adorned with beautiful garlands of flowers, their arms shining with bracelets, their swords resting on their shoulders, their earrings dangling, wearing beautiful and varied garments, their crowns adorned with golden threads, their movements graceful, their speech full of pride, and their radiance great, marched ahead of the princes. ||5-7||  Skilled musicians played flutes, lutes, mridangas, and other instruments, and performed graceful dances in front of the princes. ||8||  The sound of the soft, melodious trumpets, skillfully played, combined with the sound of conch shells, rose up like the roar of a war-trumpet. ||9||  Then, adorned with ornaments and full of joy, the princes entered Lanka, a city like the city of the gods, like playful Asura princes. ||10||  When the women of Lanka saw Angada, who was adorned with great glory, entering the city, they said to each other, ||11||  "Oh, friend, look! In one ear, he wears a beautiful, delicate, and pure talapatrika made of ivory, and in the other ear, he wears a dazzling, sparkling, and playful pearl earring, which shines like the combined radiance of all the planets. ||12-13|| 

Page #43:

The Seventy-First Chapter

This Angada, skilled in creating the unparalleled moonlight, has risen in the city of Dasamukha, fearless. ||14|| What has he begun here? How will this happen? Will this play of his, devoid of fault, be successful? ||15||

The foot soldiers, seeing the jewel-studded exterior of Ravana's abode, mistook it for a crocodile-infested lake and were filled with fear. ||16|| Seeing the immobility of the form, they realized it was a jewel-studded floor, and then, filled with wonder, they moved forward. ||17||

They reached the grand entrance of the palace, built with great jewels, resembling the cave of Mount Meru, shining with jewel-studded arches. ||18||

There, they saw elephants made of indigo lapis lazuli, resembling the Anjanadri mountain, with smooth cheeks, large teeth, and extremely bright. ||19||

They also saw lion cubs, with their tails raised, their mouths fierce with fangs, their eyes terrifying, and their beautiful manes, standing on the heads of these elephants. ||20||

Seeing these, the foot soldiers, mistaking them for real elephants and lions, were terrified and fled, reaching the utmost state of bewilderment. ||21||

Then, Angada, knowing their true nature, explained to them, and with great difficulty, they turned back after a long time. ||22||

The soldiers, with their eyes darting about, entered Ravana's palace, filled with fear, like a herd of deer entering a lion's den. ||23||

They crossed many doors, but unable to go further, they wandered about in the dense palace structure, like the blind born. ||24||

Seeing the walls made of indigo lapis lazuli, they mistook them for doors, and seeing the buildings studded with crystal gems, they went towards them, mistaking them for the sky. As a result, they fell from both places, their heads hitting the stones, and they were filled with great distress, their eyes closed in pain. ||25-26||

Somehow, they got up and moved forward, but reaching another chamber, they again collided with the sky-crystal walls. ||27||

Their foreheads were bruised, and they were in pain from the impact, but they could not find their way out. ||28||

## Chapter 16 of the Padma Purana

Padma Purana

Remembering the Indranila-made land, they were confused and deceived by their minds, and fell into the houses on the surface of the earth. ||21||

Then, fearing that the earth might split open, they sought refuge in another place. Knowing, knowing, they placed their feet on the Indranila-made lands. ||30||

Seeing the steps made of crystal, they were ready to go up. They understood that it was the sky, but they placed their feet differently again. ||31||

Fearing, they went inside, and again they fell against the walls, and stood there, bewildered by the crystal. ||32||

They saw the peak of the Shanti Bhavan, facing them. But they were unable to go there, because of the crystal walls. ||33||

"O beautiful one, tell me the way," said a warrior, in a hurry. He grabbed the hand of a doll, attached to a pillar. ||34||

He saw a doorkeeper, holding a golden vine. He asked him, "Tell me the way to the Shanti Bhavan, quickly." ||35||

"How can this arrogant one not speak?" Thinking this, a warrior slapped him with force, and his fingers were crushed. ||36||

Knowing that it was artificial, after touching it with his hand, they went into another chamber, having found the door with difficulty. ||37||

"Is this not a door, but a wall made of great Indranila gems?" They were filled with doubt, and stretched out their hands first. ||38||

They themselves were unable to return by the same path they had come. Their minds, filled with deceitful illusions, decided to go to the Shanti Bhavan. ||39||

Then, seeing a man, and knowing him to be real by his speech, a warrior grabbed him by the hair and said harshly, "Go, go, show me the way to the Shanti Bhavan." When he started to go ahead, they were relieved. ||40-41||

1. This is a Kshatriya. (1)

The Seventy-First Chapter

Reaching the abode of Shantinath, they all arrived, their hearts filled with joy, offering floral tributes and chanting victory cries. ||42||

They saw cities adorned with crystal pillars, situated in beautiful lands, as if suspended in the sky, a sight that filled them with wonder. ||43||

"Look at this wonder! Look at this wonder! And this is the greatest wonder!" They exclaimed, showing each other the magnificent treasures of the temple. ||44||

Angad, having already renounced his chariot, was filled with awe at the wondrous architecture of the temple. With lotus-like hands placed on his forehead, he circumambulated the temple, his mouth chanting hymns. ||45||

He had stationed his entire army outside the inner sanctum, surrounded by his closest companions. His eyes, like blooming lotuses, were capable of captivating the hearts of even the most beautiful women. ||47||

Gazing at the silent paintings depicting the life of the Jain sage, he offered his heartfelt salutations to them, standing before the walls of the main hall. ||48||

With a calm and joyful heart, he entered the sacred abode of Shantinath. He performed his obeisance with utmost reverence. ||49||

There, he saw Ravana seated in a half-lotus posture, facing Shantinath. Ravana, radiating the brilliance of a thousand Indranila gems, sat before the Lord like Rahu before the Sun. ||50||

He was deeply absorbed in meditation, contemplating knowledge, just as Bharata had contemplated taking the vows of renunciation. ||51||

Angad addressed Ravana, "Tell me, Ravana, what is your state of mind now? I will inflict upon you a fate that even the powerful Yama cannot bring about." ||52||

"What audacity you have to spread deceit in the presence of the Jina! Shame on you, wicked one! You have embarked on a futile endeavor." ||53||

With these words, he struck Ravana with a piece of his upper garment, laughing loudly and arrogantly. ||54||

He then picked up the flowers placed before Ravana and, with a harsh voice, hurled them at the women standing below. ||55||

Having said this, he leaped forward like a lion, and seizing the queen, who was most dear to him, and who trembled with fear, her eyes rolling, and her hair dishevelled, he dragged her along, as the king Bharata drags the goddess of fortune.

Then he said to Ravana, "O hero! This is the great queen Mandodari, who is dearer to you than life itself, and who is the very embodiment of virtue, who is being carried away."

"She will be the excellent fly-whisk bearer of Sugriva, the king of the Vidyadharas, who dwells in the assembly hall."

Then she, whose bosom was trembling, and whose garment was slipping from her breast, kept adjusting it with her restless hands, and her lower lip was constantly wet with tears, and her whole body was resounding with the tinkling of her ornaments, she, who was overwhelmed with grief, fell at the feet of her lord, and then entered his embrace, and said, "O lord! Protect me! Do you not see my plight? Are you someone else? Are you not the same Dasamukha? Alas! You have adopted the indifference of the liberated ones, but what will this indifference avail you in the face of such sorrow?

"Fie upon your valor! What is the use of your meditation, if you do not cut off the head of this sinner with your sword?

"You, who could not bear defeat at the hands of men like the moon and the sun, why do you now tolerate this insult from a mere mortal?

"But Ravana, with his mind fixed in deep meditation, did not seem to notice anything. He was sitting in half-lotus posture, his envy had been banished, his radiance was like that of a mountain of jewels obtained from the vast caves of Mount Mandara, he was free from all sense-activity, he was devoted to the worship of knowledge, his body was steady, he was full of fortitude, and he seemed like a clay image.

"Like Rama, who was meditating on Sita, he was absorbed in contemplation, and he was as immovable as Mount Mandara." 

Page #48:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
Then, clearly indicating the ten directions, she proclaimed, "Victory!" The knowledge, standing before him, spoke to his father. ||5||
She said to the gods and Siddhas, "I am ready to obey your command. O Lord, give me an order, I can achieve everything in the entire world." ||86||
Leaving aside one who wields a discus and stands against you, I can bring the entire world under your control, following your wishes. ||7||
O best of men, the discus-jewel is in your hand. What can others like Rama and Lakshmana achieve? Do they have the power to capture me? What is it? ||8||
This is the nature of those like us, we are not capable of defeating a Chakravarti, and what to say of others? ||86||
Tell me today, shall I destroy all the demons who are displeased with you, or even the celestial beings? ||10||
I have no respect for those who are proud of their petty knowledge, those who fly in the sky like grass, I consider them insignificant. ||11||
Having bowed down to the knowledge that was being worshipped, whose meditation was complete, who was situated in the midst of supreme brilliance, and who was the bearer of noble deeds, Dashaanan, as long as he circumambulates the shrine of peace, Angada, radiant like the sun, leaving behind Mandodari, whose body was filled with sorrow, flew up into the sky and went to meet Rama. ||12-13||
Thus ends the seventy-first chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the Padmayana, narrated by the sage Ravisha, describing the attainment of the knowledge of the many forms by Ravana. ||71||
1. The knowledge stood before him, M. ||

## The 67th Chapter

Then, thousands of women, all together, fell at his feet, weeping and uttering sweet sounds. They said, "O Lord, the ruler of all the Vidyadharas, while you are present, the young Angada has come and humiliated us all." (1) "While you are meditating, the supreme abode of brilliance, even that lowly Vidyadhara, like a firefly, has been affected by passion." (2) "See our state, brought about by the wicked Sugriva's son, we are afraid in your presence." (4) Hearing their words, the ruler of Trikuta, eager to console them, spoke with his three pure eyes, filled with anger. "He is bound by the noose of death, surely, for he dares to act thus. O Goddesses, be at peace, your nature is to be calm." (5-6) "My beloveds, tomorrow, on the battlefield, I will make Sugriva lifeless, without a head, and I will turn his halo of light into a halo of darkness." (7) "What anger can there be towards those lowly creatures, Rama and Lakshmana, like insects on the ground? But I will surely kill all the Vidyadharas who have gathered on their side." (8) "My beloveds, my enemies are subject to my mere glance, and now that I have mastered the art of transformation, why would they not be subdued?" (9) Thus, consoling the women, Ravana thought, "Now I have defeated my enemies." Then, emerging from the Jain temple, he engaged in the activities of bathing and other bodily functions. (10)

Then, his bath ceremony took place, filled with the sounds of various musical instruments, and adorned with various wonderful dances, as beautiful as the god of love. (11) Many young women, dark as night, immersed in the radiance of the moon, bathed him with silver pitchers, like full moons. (12) 

Page #50:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, 
Many women, radiant like the evening twilight, bathed him with reverence, using golden pitchers that shone like the young sun. (13)
Others bathed him with excellent pitchers made of lapis lazuli, as if the goddesses of fortune themselves were bathing him with lotus petals. (14)
Some bathed him with pitchers red like the morning sun, others with pitchers white like the inside of a banana tree, and still others with pitchers that attracted swarms of bees with their fragrance. (15)
Before his bath, beautiful women with graceful movements rubbed him with various fragrant pastes. Then, seated on a magnificent throne adorned with the brilliance of many gems, he bathed. (16)
After bathing, he adorned himself and, filled with noble emotions, re-entered the temple of Shantinath. (17)
There, with devotion to praise, he performed the highest worship of the Arhant, offering prostrations with his mind, speech, and body. Then he entered the dining hall. (18)
Having consumed four types of excellent food, the king went to the playground to test his knowledge. (19)
Through the power of his knowledge, he created many forms and performed various wondrous deeds that were beyond the reach of other celestial beings. (20)
He struck the earth so hard that it trembled, and the bodies of his enemies on it spun around. The enemy army, terrified, cried out in fear of death. (21)
Then the ministers said to Ravana, who had finished testing his knowledge, "O King, there is no one else who can kill Rama now that you have been released." (22)
"In the battlefield, when he is angry and releases his arrows, no one else is capable of standing before him except you." (23)
Ravana, endowed with great powers, created a vast army through the power of his knowledge. Wearing the jewel-studded discus, he set out towards the garden of pleasure where Sita resided. (24)
Surrounded by wise and valiant ministers, Ravana appeared like Indra surrounded by the gods. Or, like the sun, he advanced without hindrance. (25)

In the Padma Purana,
See the peaks of the Agara mountain, the Chaitya Kuta, the ocean, and the great rivers, and make yourself happy. ||41||
After that, Sita, whose throat was choked with tears, joined her hands with great difficulty and spoke to Ravana with a sorrowful voice, ||42||
"O Dasanan! If you have any affection for me, or if you are pleased with me, then you should be able to fulfill this request of mine. ||43||
Even if you are angry with Rama when he comes before you, you should not kill him without delivering my message. ||44||
Tell him, 'O Rama! Your sister, the daughter of the Bhāmaṇḍala, has sent this message for you: that in the battle against you, due to the power of karma, you will hear something else. The daughter of the great sage Janaka, Sita, overwhelmed by the weight of great sorrow, has become like the flame of a lamp struck by the wind, and has been reduced to a deplorable state. O Lord! I have not given up my life until now, only because of my longing for your arrival.' ||45-47||
Having said this, she fainted and fell to the ground with her eyes closed, like a golden Kalpa tree broken by a maddened elephant. ||48||
Seeing Sita in such a state, Ravana, whose heart was tender, became extremely sorrowful and began to think: "Alas! This affection of theirs is an unquenchable affection, caused by the bonds of karma. It seems that they will never be released from this worldly pit." ||49-50||
"I curse myself again and again! What a despicable act I have done! I have separated this couple who were united in love. ||51||
I am a great sinner! Without any purpose, I have acquired the dirt of disgrace from the righteous, like an ordinary man. ||52||
I, a wicked man, have defiled the pure and vast lineage like a lotus. Alas! How did I commit this act? ||53||
Curse this woman who instantly kills great men, who is like a Kimpaka fruit, and who is the source of suffering for the earth. ||54||
A woman in general,
1. Sita. 2. Unquenchable affection. 3. Burning.

This river-like crooked, terrible, Dharma-Artha-destroying, and the mine of all inauspiciousness, should be abandoned by the virtuous with effort. ||56||

She who was like nectar, who seemed to nourish me with her beauty, and who was more beloved than all the goddesses, is now, with her heart attached to another, like a pot filled with poison, causing me great distress. ||57-58||

She who, even though she did not desire me, used to make my mind restless, she who was the object of my constant thoughts, is now like withered grass, deserving of no respect. ||59||

Even if this Sita, whose heart is attached to another man, desires me now, what pleasure can I derive from her, devoid of true affection? ||60||

At the time when my wise brother Vibhishana was favorable to me and gave me good advice, this wicked mind did not attain peace. ||61||

Rather, it became subject to delusion due to his advice, which is natural, for the minds of virtuous men are often under control. ||62||

After considering this, Ravana thought, "Yesterday, I had a council with my ministers regarding the war. Now, what is the point of discussing friendship with those who are condemned by the heroes?" ||63||

To fight and to show compassion are two contradictory things. Alas! I, like an ordinary man, have fallen into this great predicament. ||64||

If I surrender Sita to Rama out of compassion now, the world will consider me weak, for it is difficult to understand the minds of all. ||65||

He who is free to do whatever he wants, lives happily, being cruel. A man like me, whose heart is soft with compassion, lives in sorrow. ||66||

If I defeat Rama and Lakshmana, who are skilled in the arts of the lion and the Garuda, in battle, capture them alive, and then, with all my wealth, return Sita to Rama, I will not be guilty of any sin. ||67-68||

And the great public censure arising from fear and injustice...

Padma Purana
1
Having resolved in his mind, the great and powerful Ravana, who was like an elephant, entered the lotus forest, which was like the inner apartments. || 70 ||
Then, remembering the great insult he had suffered at the hands of his enemies, Ravana's eyes blazed with anger, and he became as terrifying as Yama himself. || 71 ||
With trembling lips, the ten-headed Ravana spoke words that caused a terrible fever to spread among the women. || 72 ||
He said, "In battle, I will seize that wicked and invincible Angada, along with the sinner, and cleave him in two with my sword that shines with rays of light. || 73 ||
I will capture that dark sphere and bind him tightly, then crush his life with blows from my iron mace. || 74 ||
And I will bind the wicked Hanuman in a wooden clamp, and tear him apart with my razor-sharp karont. || 75 ||
Except for Rama, I will destroy all the other wicked and evil enemies who have transgressed the limits of propriety, crushing them with a shower of weapons in battle. || 76 ||
Gautama Swami says, "O King of Magadha! When Ravana was making this resolution, the following words were being uttered by the seers of omens, that is, they were discussing these things among themselves. || 77 ||
"Look, these hundreds of kinds of calamities are happening. There is a very harsh, weapon-like circle around the sun. || 78 ||
The moon is hiding somewhere, as if in fear, throughout the whole night. There are terrible thunderbolts falling, and a great earthquake is shaking the earth. || 79 ||
A red meteor, like blood, fell in the east, and jackals were howling mournfully in the north. || 80 ||
Horses are neighing with trembling necks and loud voices, and elephants are striking the earth with their trunks, making a harsh sound. || 81 ||
The images of the gods have become like days of sorrow, weeping tears. Great trees are falling without any apparent cause. || 82 ||
Crows are facing the sun, making a harsh sound, and they have abandoned their flocks, sitting alone, their wings drooping, and they look very distressed. || 83 ||
Even large ponds are suddenly drying up. Mountain peaks are falling, and the sky is raining blood. || 84 ||

The Seventy-First Chapter

Death is often foretold by these omens, for such changes do not occur in other ways. Even Indra, when his merit is depleted, falls from his position. In truth, the people are subject to their karma, and heroism is a quality, not a primary factor. What is destined to be obtained will be obtained; one cannot escape it. There is no heroism for beings in the presence of fate; they must suffer the consequences of their actions.

Behold, this Ravana, skilled in all the sciences of statecraft, knowledgeable in the principles of democracy, a scholar of Jain grammar, and adorned with great virtues, is nevertheless, due to his own actions, trapped in a cycle of suffering, his mind clouded, and he has strayed from the right path.

There is no greater sorrow in the world than death, yet see, Ravana, filled with excessive pride, does not even contemplate it. Though devoid of the power of the stars and afflicted by crooked, evil planets, this foolish one still desires to go to the battlefield.

Fearful of the destruction of his power, filled with the sentiment of a single warrior, though he has studied the scriptures, he does not discern what is right and wrong.

Therefore, O King Shrenik, I will tell you what was in the mind of this arrogant Ravana. Listen to the truth.

Ravana thought, "Having conquered all people, and freed my sons and brothers, I will return to Lanka and continue to do all this. I will drive out all the lowly earth-dwellers from this earth and establish the praiseworthy celestial beings in their place."

**The Lineage of the Descendants**

In this lineage, the Tirthankaras, the lords of the three worlds, praised by the gods, the Chakravartins, the Balabhadra, the Narayana, and we, will be born.

Padma Purana
The karma that is *nikaachit* by a man, he enjoys its fruit by *niyog*. Otherwise, how can the darkness of a man-like owl remain when the sun of the scriptures is shining brightly? ||17||
Thus ends the seventy-second chapter of the Padma Purana, known as *Aarsha*, narrated by Acharya Ravishena, which narrates the determination of Ravana's war. ||72||
We, men like us, will be born in this lineage. ||66||

## The Thirty-Seventh Chapter

Then, on another day, the supremely radiant Ravana, adorned with a brilliant aura, stood in the assembly hall as the sun rose. [1]

He was served by Kubera, Varuna, Ishana, Yama, and Soma, along with many other kings, making him appear as resplendent as Indra himself. [2]

Surrounded by valiant men born of noble lineage, seated on his throne, Ravana shone with a brilliance like the moon surrounded by stars. [3]

He was fragrant with divine perfumes, his garments, garlands, and unguents were all celestial. His chest was adorned with necklaces, he was handsome and had a gentle gaze. [4]

With a generous heart, he looked around the assembly and thought, "The valiant Meghavahana is not present in his place." [5]

Nor was Indrajeet, who shone like Indra himself and was beloved for his captivating eyes, nor was Bhanukarna (Kumbhakarna), who radiated like the sun. [6]

Though this assembly, like a lake, is adorned with lotus-like men, it lacks the brilliance of those great men, and therefore does not possess its full splendor. [7]

Though Ravana's eyes were like blooming lotuses and he himself was exceptionally beautiful, his face was marred by the anguish of worry, making him difficult to look at. [8]

His forehead, like a courtyard, was shrouded in darkness caused by the knot of his furrowed brows. He was as terrifying as Yama, radiating the fierce glow of an angry serpent. [9]

Seeing Ravana with his lips tightly clenched, immersed in his own thoughts, the ministers were deeply frightened and unsure of what to do. [10]

Their minds were filled with anxiety, wondering, "Is he angry with me or with him?" They all stood with folded hands, their heads bowed to the ground. [11]

May, Ugra, Shuka, Lokaksha, and Saran, along with other ministers, were ashamed and looked down at the ground, their faces filled with sorrow. [12]

## Padma Purana

**Chapter 13:**

The king's soldiers, with their earrings swaying, were shouting, "O God, be pleased! Be pleased!" with great urgency.

**Chapter 14:**

The women, residing in palaces with walls shining like Kailasa peaks, were terrified and looking at him.

**Chapter 15:**

Mandodari, with her eyes filled with fear and her mind disturbed, saw him through the windows made of jewels.

**Chapter 16-17:**

With his red eyes, the powerful Ravana rose and was about to enter his shining armory, filled with invincible weapons made of jewels. He was as eager to enter the armory as Indra is to enter his celestial abode. As he was about to enter, several inauspicious omens appeared.

**Chapter 18:**

A sneeze came from behind, a great serpent crossed his path, and it seemed as if people were saying, "Ha, hi, this is a curse! Where are you going?"

**Chapter 19:**

His umbrella, adorned with a sapphire rod, was broken by the wind. His upper garment fell down, and a crow cawed on his right side.

**Chapter 20:**

Other inauspicious omens also dissuaded him from going to war. In reality, none of them, neither by words, actions, nor thoughts, approved of his going to war.

**Chapter 21:**

Seeing these ominous signs, those who were skilled in the knowledge of various omens became extremely anxious.

**Chapter 22:**

Mandodari, gathering the wise ministers like Shuka, said, "Why don't you speak to the king about his welfare?"

**Chapter 23:**

"Knowing both your own and others' actions, what are you doing now? Kumbhakarna and others are powerless and have been imprisoned for many days.

**Chapter 24:**

"These heroes, whose brilliance is like that of the guardians of the world, and who have performed many wonders, are now captured by the enemy. What are you doing to restore their strength?"

**Notes:**

* **Sneezing:** According to the Shakun Shastra (Omen Science), sneezing in different directions has different meanings. Sneezing in the east signifies death, in the southeast signifies grief, in the south signifies loss, in the southwest signifies auspiciousness, in the west signifies sweet food, in the northwest signifies wealth, in the north signifies conflict, in the northeast signifies gain of wealth, in the sky signifies destruction of all, and in the underworld signifies attainment of all wealth. Ravana sneezed, signifying death.

The seventy-third chapter.

After paying obeisance to the Devi, the chief ministers said, "O Devi! The rule of Dasanan is like the rule of Yama, he is very proud and considers himself the supreme." ||25|| "O Lord! In the whole world, there is no man whose words, which are for the ultimate benefit of others, are accepted by him." ||26|| "Whatever is going to happen to the minds of those who follow their karma, even Indra and the group of gods cannot change it." ||27|| "Even though Trikutaindra knows the essence of all the scriptures and the ultimate knowledge, he is still bound by delusion." ||28|| "We have explained it to him in many ways, there is no way left in which we have not explained it to him, yet his mind is not turning away from the desired object - Sita." ||29|| "It is difficult to stop a great river in the rainy season when the flow of water is overflowing, or a man who is driven by karma." ||30|| "O Lord! Even though we have said everything, what is the fault in it? Perhaps your words may bring him to his senses. It is not right to ignore him." ||31|| "Hearing the words of the ministers, Mandodari, who had decided to go to Ravana, who was trembling with fear and seemed like a frightened Lakshmi, who was covered in a clean, long, variegated garment that resembled water, was ready to go to Ravana." ||32-33|| "Like Rati, who was ready to go to her husband, Kamadeva, all the members of the family turned their attention towards Mandodari, who was going to Ravana." ||34|| "Mandodari, who was surrounded by women holding umbrellas and whisks, seemed like Shachi going to Indra - the queen of Indra." ||35|| "Mandodari, who was breathing heavily, who was stumbling while walking, whose girdle was slightly loose, who was always eager to serve her husband, and who was like a great river of love, was seen by Ravana with playful eyes. At that time, Ravana was respectfully touching his armor and the group of his main weapons." ||36-37|| "Ravana said, "O beautiful one! O you who walk with a gait as graceful as a swan..." ||38||

Padma Purana
Why is the heart of the ten-headed one, the radiant one, being taken away? It is as if his presence in a dream is being rejected. ||36||
Then, with a face like a pure, full moon, with eyes like blooming lotuses, with a natural grace, she, who was skilled in casting charming glances, whose body was the abode of Madana, with her sweet, intermittent sounds, ||40||
with a body like a cage of variegated shadows of teeth and lips, with a belly bent under the weight of the golden, great pots of her breasts, ||42||
with her three lines of beauty slipping, extremely delicate, extremely beautiful, bowed down and spoke, the epitome of the grace of her lord: ||43||
"O Lord, grant me the boon of my husband, attain happiness. You are united with supreme love, dharma, and compassion. ||44||
O Great King, hold me up, who am sinking in the ocean of sorrow of separation, with waves of the best of resolutions. ||45||
O Great Intellect, you are like the sun in the sky of your relatives, therefore, do not completely neglect this vast lotus forest of the family, which is going to destruction. ||46||
O Lord, even though my words are harsh, please listen to them. You are worthy of my forgiveness, as you have given me this position. ||47||
Words that are not contradictory, that are in accordance with nature, and that bring happiness in the end, even if they are unpleasant, are to be accepted like medicine from a friend. ||48||
Why are you mounting this scale of doubt, which is without any counterweight? Why are you causing distress to yourself and us without any reason? ||49||
What has been lost to you today? It is the same old land. Only, O Lord, stop your mind from going astray. ||50||
This desire of yours has been set in motion, and it is in great danger. Quickly restrain these horses of the senses, you who hold the strong reins of discrimination. ||51||

O Lord, even though my words are harsh, please listen to them. You are worthy of my forgiveness, as you have given me this position. ||47||
Words that are not contradictory, that are in accordance with nature, and that bring happiness in the end, even if they are unpleasant, are to be accepted like medicine from a friend. ||48||
Why are you mounting this scale of doubt, which is without any counterweight? Why are you causing distress to yourself and us without any reason? ||49||
What has been lost to you today? It is the same old land. Only, O Lord, stop your mind from going astray. ||50||
This desire of yours has been set in motion, and it is in great danger. Quickly restrain these horses of the senses, you who hold the strong reins of discrimination. ||51||
...
My dear! O Goddess! What is the purpose of your coming here with such speed? ||38||
O Radiant One! Why is your arrival taking away the heart of Ravana, like the sudden presence in a dream? ||39||
Then, with a face like a pure, full moon, with eyes like blooming lotuses, with a natural grace, she, who was skilled in casting charming glances, whose body was the abode of Madana, with her sweet, intermittent sounds, ||40||
with a body like a cage of variegated shadows of teeth and lips, with a belly bent under the weight of the golden, great pots of her breasts, ||42||
with her three lines of beauty slipping, extremely delicate, extremely beautiful, bowed down and spoke, the epitome of the grace of her lord: ||43||
"O Lord, grant me the boon of my husband, attain happiness. You are united with supreme love, dharma, and compassion. ||44||

## The 67th Chapter

Having known your excellent fortitude, depth, and wisdom, it seems that you are being led astray by someone, just like Sita went astray. ||52||

Seeing your reflection in the well of misfortune, like the spider seeing its reflection in the water, why are you drawn to these calamities? ||53||

Break through the towering tree of infamy, which brings immense suffering. What fruit do you desire, like the hollow stem of a banana tree? ||54||

O, you who are as deep as the ocean, adorn your noble lineage once more. Quickly abandon Sita, who is like a thorn in the head of your noble family. ||55||

O Lord, warriors engage in conflict for the sake of wealth or with the thought, "Either I kill him or I die." But here, wealth is not the purpose of your conflict, for you have no lack of it. And the other purpose, death, is for what? To die for a woman who is not yours? This is laughable. ||56||

Or, let's say that defeating the enemy group is the purpose of the conflict. What purpose is achieved by defeating the enemy group? Therefore, O Lord, abandon this stubborn attachment to Sita. ||57||

And let the other vow remain, the vow of renouncing another woman. Only by renouncing another woman does a man of good character attain praise in both births. ||58||

A man who lusts after other women, who are like kohl, even though he is as heavy as Mount Meru, becomes as light as a blade of grass. ||59||

Even a king, or even a son of a king, who is favored by the gods, becomes stained by the mud of attachment to another woman and attains ultimate infamy. ||60||

He who engages in love with another woman, like a fool, is like one who enjoys the company of a venomous serpent. ||61||

Do not defile your pure lineage with infamy. Or, you are defiling yourself. Therefore, abandon this evil thought. ||62||

The mighty men like Samuka and Vajraghoṣa, driven by their desire for another woman, have met their destruction. Have you not heard of them? ||63||

Padma Purana
Oh beloved, why have you become so fearful? Fearful, you are indeed a fearful woman, the name is synonymous with your nature. ||65|| You are not the sun, nor are you the thunder of Saturn, nor are you any other man, why do you speak like this? ||66|| I am the fire of death, the destroyer of the enemy's army, I will not return Sita, do not fear, oh slow-witted one. ||67|| What is the purpose of this discussion for you? You are appointed to protect Sita, if you are not capable of protecting her, then return her to me quickly. ||68|| Hearing this, Mandodari said, "You desire pleasure with her, that is why you are shameless and say such things, give her to me." ||69|| Saying this, the long-eyed Mandodari, filled with jealousy, struck Ravana with a lotus flower, desiring his good fortune. ||70|| Restraining herself, she said, "Oh beautiful one, tell me, what great virtue have you seen in her that you desire her so much?" ||71|| She is not known to be virtuous, nor is she beautiful in form, nor is she skilled in the arts, nor does she follow your heart. ||72|| Even with such a Sita, oh beloved, what is your wisdom in desiring her? In my eyes, you are only revealing your own insignificance, which you do not understand. ||73|| No man can achieve greatness by praising himself, only those qualities that are praised by others become truly virtuous. ||74|| Therefore, I do not say anything, but you know yourself, what to speak of poor Sita, even Lakshmi is not equal to me. ||75|| Therefore, oh lord, abandon this excessive desire for Sita, do not fall into this exceptional fire, which is unavoidable. ||76|| You are disrespecting me by desiring this earth-bound woman, it seems as if a foolish child is discarding a ruby for a piece of glass. ||77||
The dark-complexioned, lotus-eyed Ravana said to Mandodari, "Why have you become so fearful? Fearful, you are indeed a fearful woman, the name is synonymous with your nature. ||65|| I am not the sun, nor am I the thunder of Saturn, nor am I any other man, why do you speak like this? ||66|| I am the fire of death, the destroyer of the enemy's army, I will not return Sita, do not fear, oh slow-witted one. ||67|| What is the purpose of this discussion for you?

## The 73rd Chapter

**78.**  This form of yours is not divine, it does not arise in my mind. How can you desire this village woman, O Lord?

**79.**  I am extremely skilled in assuming forms according to your desire, so command me, how should I become? O Lord, shall I become Lakshmi, who quickly takes delight in your lotus-like abode and steals your heart? Or, O Lord, shall I become Sachi, the resting place of Indra's eyes?

**80.**  Or shall I become Rati herself, who binds the mind of Kamadeva? Or, O Lord, shall I become one who acts according to your will?

**1.**  Then, with his head lowered and eyes half-open, Ravana, filled with shame, spoke softly, "My dear, you are right to call me a womanizer."

**2.**  "Look what I have done! By being attached to another woman, I have brought upon myself the greatest infamy and made this foolish soul utterly insignificant."

**3.**  "May this heart, which is attached to the flesh of worldly pleasures, a vessel of sin, and fickle, be cursed! O heart, your actions are utterly base!"

**4.**  Saying this, Dashaanan, whose moon-like smile spread upwards and whose lotus-like eyes were blooming, spoke again to Mandodari:

**85.**  "O Devi, even though you are not in a form created by magic, but in your natural state, you are most dear to me. What need do I have of other women, O best one?"

**86.**  Having received the favor of her Lord, Mandodari, whose heart was filled with joy, spoke again, "O Lord, is it appropriate to show a lamp to the sun? In the same way, it is futile for me to make any request of you."

**87.**  "O Dashaanan, I have spoken this beneficial word among my friends, so ask other wise men as well. I am powerless and do not understand."

**88.**  "Even if someone who knows all the scriptures, O Lord, is negligent due to fate, should a creature who desires his well-being try to enlighten him?"

**10.**  Just as Vishnu Kumar Muni had forgotten his soul due to his actions, was he not awakened by the songs of the principles?

**77.**  Chhoḍakar desires a glass.

**1.**  Chanchala, M.

The Puranas
This distinction of "this is a man and this is a woman" is made by the foolish. The wise, on the other hand, seek good words from all, both men and women. ||11||
If you have even a little bit of affection for me, then I say, give up your desire for another woman, or abandon the path of a man who is enamored with another woman. ||12||
If you permit me, I will take Janaki and bring her to Rama, and I will bring back your sons Indrajit and Meghavahana, and your brother Kumbhakarna. What is the purpose of killing so many people? ||63-64||
Thus spoken to, Ravana, the king of the Rakshasas, became very angry and said, "Go, go, messenger, go where I cannot see your face." ||65||
Oh, you think yourself very wise, abandoning your own progress and engaging in the lowly act of praising the enemy. ||66||
You are the mother of heroes and my queen, yet you speak such lowly words. It seems there is no other cowardly woman greater than you. ||67||
Thus spoken to, the queen said, "Listen to what the wise have said about the birth of the Balabhadra, Narayana, and Prati-Narayana." ||98||
Oh, Lord, in this age, there have already been seven Balabhadra, namely Vijay, Achal, Bhadra, Suprabha, Sudarshana, Ananda, and Nandana, and seven Narayana, namely Triprutha, Dwiprutha, Swayambhu, Purushottama, Narasimha, Pundarika, and Datta. All these were very valiant and famous men in the world. At this time, there are two Balabhadra, namely Padma and Lakshmana, and two Narayana. Oh, Dashaanan, it seems that both of them have arrived here. Just as Ashvagriva, Taraka, and other Prati-Narayana were destroyed by them, so it seems that you also wish to be destroyed by them. ||102||
The teacher did not enlighten him through instruction. ||60||

## The 37th Chapter

**O Lord!**  I am apprehensive about explaining the truth, as long as the complete certainty of the subject to be explained is not apparent.  

**103.**  A wise person should perform actions that bring happiness in this world and the next, and not those that are the cause of the sprouting of the seed of suffering and the source of blame.

**104.**  O Ravana, blinded by sin!  If there is a person in the three worlds who has attained satisfaction from enjoying pleasures for a long time, then praise him.

**105.**  Even if you cannot become a monk after enjoying all pleasures, at least be devoted to the duties of a householder and destroy suffering.

**106.**  O Lord!  Your body is radiant with the sword of **Anuvrata**, adorned with the umbrella of **Niyama**, clad in the armor of **Samyak Darshan**, and marked by the flag of **Sheel**.  Your body is fragrant with the sandalwood of **Bhavana**, your bow is **Samyak Gyan**, you are strong with the power of **Vashendriya**, and you are powerful with the might of **Shubh Dhyan**.  You are equipped with the bridle of **Maryada**, riding on the elephant of **Nischya**, and your great power is **Jin Bhakti**.  Conquer the army of **Durgati**.  Indeed, this army of **Durgati** is very crooked, sinful, and extremely difficult to bear.  By conquering it, you will become happy.

**107-110.**  Wander through Jambudvipa, worshipping the natural **Jinalayas** on the mountains like Himavat and Mandara, along with me.

**111.**  Play in the groves of Mandaragiri and on the banks of the Ganga, adorned with the leaves of the hands of eighteen thousand women.

**112.**  O Beautiful!  The **Vidhyadhar** couples roam freely in their desired, beautiful places, enjoying themselves.

**113.**  O Learned!  O Glorious!  There is no purpose in fighting.  Be pleased and accept my words, which will bring happiness in every way.

**114.**  Abandon this slander, which is like poison, blameworthy, and the cause of ultimate misfortune.  Why are you drowning in the ocean of disgrace?

**115.**  Thus, Mandoadari, with folded hands, fell at the feet of Ravana, seeking his ultimate welfare.

**116.**  

Page #66:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, 
Ravana, fearless and without fear, said to the frightened Mandodari, "Why are you filled with fear without any reason?" ||117||
"Oh beautiful one! There is no man greater than me. Why are you clinging to this false fear because of your womanhood?" ||118||
"You said that you were informing me of the rise of another side. But, oh Devi, let me tell you clearly, there are many men who bear the name Narayana and Baldeva. Does the mere attainment of a name bring about the fulfillment of a task?" ||119-120||
"Oh fearful one! If someone, be it a beast or a man, is given the name Siddha, does he attain the happiness of Siddhahood merely by the name?" ||121||
"Just as I made Indra, the lord of the city of Rathnapur, attain the state of Anindra, you see how I have made this Narayana into Anarayan." ||122||
Thus, boasting of his strength, the mighty Ravana, whose body was covered in a sheet of his own brilliance, and whose actions were dependent on Yama, entered the pleasure house with Mandodari, just as Indra enters with Lakshmi. ||123-124||
Then, as the time of evening arrived, the sun, whose disc was setting due to the twilight, contracted its rays, just as a sage contracts his passions. ||125||
The sun, red with the twilight, seemed to be scolding the day, as if it were being bitten by the lips of the twilight, and then disappeared somewhere. ||126||
The lotuses, with their folded petals, seemed to be offering their lotus-like hands, while the cries of the swans mourned the setting sun. ||127||
As the sun set, the army of planets and stars arrived on the same path, as if the moon had released them to roam freely, giving them permission. ||128||
Then, as the evening, illuminated by the jewels of the lamps, appeared, Lanka, shining with its brilliance, resembled the peak of Mount Meru. ||129||

The 37th Chapter

The sun, the eye of the world, covered the directions with its rays, resembling a circle of fire, and reached its connection with the rising point. ||15||

In the morning, the ladies were distressed, filled with sorrow, and their beloved husbands were trying to console them. They were overwhelmed with unbearable grief. ||15||

The deep-sounding drums, preceded by the sound of conch shells, were beaten by the order of Ravana, skilled in giving the signal for war. ||15||

The warriors, filled with pride and arrogance, went out, mounted on horses, elephants, and chariots, rejoicing. ||16||

They were adorned with shining weapons like swords, bows, clubs, and spears, and their bodies were decorated with waving chowries and umbrellas. ||161||

The Vidhyadhara kings, swift, like gods, powerful, and skilled in warfare, went out in great splendor. ||162||

Seeing the plight of the women, whose eyes were red like lotuses from constant weeping, even the hearts of the wicked were filled with sorrow. ||163||

One warrior, leaving his beloved behind, said, "My dear, go back, I am truly going to war." ||164||

One woman, with eyes like a deer, wanted to see her husband's face, so she said, "Take your turban, dear," as an excuse. ||165||

When her beloved was out of sight, another woman fainted and fell to the ground, surrounded by her friends, with tears streaming down her face. ||166||

One woman, returning, held onto the edge of the bed, silent and motionless, like a clay doll. ||167||

One warrior, blessed with perfect vision and a follower of the Anuvratas, was watched by his wife from behind and by a celestial maiden from the front. ||168||

The warriors, who were previously as gentle as the full moon, became fierce and radiant like Yama, when they entered the battlefield, adorned with armor. ||166||

Maricha, with his army of chariots, elephants, horses, and infantry, equipped with bows and umbrellas, arrived at the city with great speed. ||170||

The archer, Vimala Chandra, Vimala Ambuda, Sunanda, Ananda, Nanda, and others, numbering hundreds and thousands, were also there. ||171||

And in the temples of the Arhat Bhagwan, the sweet sound of music began to resonate. ||156||

The sun, resembling a mass of fire at the time of destruction, covered the directions with its rays and reached its connection with the rising point. ||157||

In the morning, the ladies were distressed, filled with sorrow, and their beloved husbands were trying to console them. They were overwhelmed with unbearable grief. ||158||

Then, by the order of Ravana, the conch shells were blown, signaling the war, and the deep-sounding drums were beaten. ||159||

The warriors, filled with pride and arrogance, went out, mounted on horses, elephants, and chariots, rejoicing. ||160||

They were adorned with shining weapons like swords, bows, clubs, and spears, and their bodies were decorated with waving chowries and umbrellas. ||161||

The Vidhyadhara kings, swift, like gods, powerful, and skilled in warfare, went out in great splendor. ||162||

Seeing the plight of the women, whose eyes were red like lotuses from constant weeping, even the hearts of the wicked were filled with sorrow. ||163||

One warrior, leaving his beloved behind, said, "My dear, go back, I am truly going to war." ||164||

One woman, with eyes like a deer, wanted to see her husband's face, so she said, "Take your turban, dear," as an excuse. ||165||

When her beloved was out of sight, another woman fainted and fell to the ground, surrounded by her friends, with tears streaming down her face. ||166||

One woman, returning, held onto the edge of the bed, silent and motionless, like a clay doll. ||167||

One warrior, blessed with perfect vision and a follower of the Anuvratas, was watched by his wife from behind and by a celestial maiden from the front. ||168||

The warriors, who were previously as gentle as the full moon, became fierce and radiant like Yama, when they entered the battlefield, adorned with armor. ||166||

Maricha, with his army of chariots, elephants, horses, and infantry, equipped with bows and umbrellas, arrived at the city with great speed. ||170||

The archer, Vimala Chandra, Vimala Ambuda, Sunanda, Ananda, Nanda, and others, numbering hundreds and thousands, were also there. ||171||

And in the temples of the Arhat Bhagwan, the sweet sound of music began to resonate. ||156||

Padma Purana
With divine chariots created by knowledge, shining with great brilliance, they shone, like Agni Kumaras, illuminating the ten directions. ||172|| Some, with weapons blazing, covered the directions with elephants like the Himalayas, as if with clouds filled with lightning. ||173|| Some, with a multitude of swift horses, bearing weapons of ten kinds, seemed to shatter the circle of stars with their speed. ||174|| With large, diverse musical instruments, the neighing of horses, the roaring of elephants, the shouts of foot soldiers, the lion roars of warriors, the victory cries of bards, the songs of entertainers, and the inspiring sounds of the skilled, ||175-176|| all these great sounds, united from all sides, made the sky resound, as if filled with the clouds of the end of the world. ||177||
The king's army, filled with horses, chariots, and foot soldiers, shining with the brilliance of their mutual excellence, with large arms, chests adorned with high armor, and lightning-like radiance, advanced towards victory. ||178|| The foot soldiers, with their swords flashing, went ahead, eager to please their lord. With their diverse groups, they filled the sky and the directions without a gap. ||179||
Thus, with the accumulated karma of the three worlds, both auspicious and inauspicious, still present, this being, though he performs many actions, is not able to do otherwise, even the sun cannot make him do otherwise. ||180||
Thus ends the seventy-third chapter of the Padma Purana, named Udyoga, narrated by the sage Ravishena. ||73||
1. Yuta M. 

Page #71:
---------------------------
The seventy-fourth chapter, with due respect and joy, is narrated as follows. The lord of the three peaks, Ravana, asked his beloved Mandodari, "Oh beloved, beautiful one, who knows if we will see each other again in this great and fearful war?" 

The beloved replied, "Oh lord, may you always prosper and conquer your enemies. We will all see you return victorious from the war." 

Thus addressed, Ravana, whose eyes were gazed upon by thousands of women, and whose radiance was immense, went out of the city. 

As he went out, he saw a magnificent chariot named Indra, created by the art of illusion, shining like the sun in autumn. 

The chariot was yoked to a thousand elephants, whose bodies were as dark as rain clouds, and whose radiance was like a halo. It seemed as if the chariot was aiming to conquer Mount Meru itself. 

The elephants were intoxicated with madness, their cheeks dripping with saliva, their four white and yellow tusks standing erect, adorned with conch shells and fly whisks, their necks adorned with pearl garlands, their large bells ringing, resembling the divine elephant Airavata, and adorned with the colors of various metals. They were invincible, the very embodiment of humility, roaring like thunder, resembling a mass of dark clouds, and moving with a beautiful grace. 

Ravana, whose arm was adorned with a beautiful bracelet, and whose radiance was like that of Indra, mounted the chariot created by illusion. 

With his large eyes and unparalleled form, Ravana mounted the chariot, as if he were about to devour the entire world with his power. 

Surrounded by ten thousand celestial kings, who were his equals, who served his interests, who were immensely powerful, who shone like the gods, and who understood his intentions, Ravana, the lord of the celestial city, prepared to face Sugriva and Ravana.

Seeing in the Padma Purana, to the south, extremely fearsome, ominous-making,
Mallas, like vultures in the sky, roam, obscuring the sun. ||14||
Knowing the signs, they speak of great destruction.
Fierce in their valor, enraged, they went forth like a great fire. ||15||
Pamabha, standing among his army, asked in astonishment,
"O, noble ones, what is the name of this city, blazing with brilliance?" ||16||
Adorned with very large, Jambunada-made peaks,
What is the name of this mountain, with the shade of a thundercloud? ||17||
Asked by him, Suṣeṇa and others, overcome by confusion,
Could not speak immediately, and he asked them again. ||18||
"Tell me, what is the name of this mountain, seen here?"
Agad, Jambavan, and others, trembled and spoke softly. ||19||
"This is the chariot of Padma-naabha, with many forms,
Created by his knowledge, skilled in causing death-fever." ||20||
"The one who was angered by the son of the king of Kishkindha,
That Ravana, bearing great illusionary power, sits here." ||21||
Hearing their words, Lakshmana spoke to the charioteer,
"Bring the chariot quickly," he said, and he did so. ||22||
Then, the fierce, fearsome, assembled,
Their sound mixed with the sound of millions of conch shells, along with other instruments. ||23||
Hearing that sound, the delighted warriors, with fierce gestures,
Armed, with quivers on their shoulders, stood near Lakshmana. ||24||
"Do not fear, beloved, stay here, return, abandon sorrow,
I will conquer the lord of Lanka and return to you today." ||25||
Thus, the proud warriors, comforting their excellent wives,
Prepared within the palace, and went out as they should. ||26||
Driven by the urge of mutual competition,
The warriors mounted their chariots, etc., their eyes flickering towards their weapons. ||27||
The chariot, joined with a great elephant, with a deep, resonant sound,
The lord of the sky, Bhutasvana, mounted, shone. ||28||
Seeing the celestial sphere, enraged, he went towards them.
In the south of Ravana, bears were making extremely fearsome sounds, and vultures were circling in the sky, obscuring the sun. ||12, 14||
The great warriors, filled with the pride of valor, though they knew these were bad omens, signifying death, were enraged and continued to advance. ||15||
Standing in the midst of his army, Rama, astonished, asked the soldiers, "O, noble men! What is the name of this city, blazing with brilliance, adorned with large, golden peaks, and bearing the radiance of a thundercloud?" ||16, 17||
Supeṇa and the other celestial beings were themselves confused, so they were not able to answer Rama immediately. Still, Rama kept asking them, "Tell me, what is the name of this mountain seen here?" Then, trembling with fear, Jambavan and others spoke softly, "O Rama! This is the chariot of Padma-naabha, with many forms, created by his knowledge, skilled in causing death-fever." ||18-20||
"The one who was angered by the son of the king of Kishkindha, that Ravana, bearing great illusionary power, sits here." ||21||
Hearing their words, Lakshmana said to the charioteer, "Bring the chariot quickly." Hearing this, the charioteer obeyed, bringing the chariot and presenting it. ||22||
Then, the fierce, fearsome, assembled, their sound mixed with the sound of millions of conch shells, along with other instruments. ||23||
Hearing that sound, the delighted warriors, with fierce gestures, armed, with quivers on their shoulders, stood near Lakshmana. ||24||
"Do not fear, beloved, stay here, return, abandon sorrow, I will conquer the lord of Lanka and return to you today." Thus, the proud warriors, comforting their excellent wives, prepared within the palace, and went out as they should. ||25-26||
Driven by the urge of mutual competition, the warriors mounted their chariots, etc., their eyes flickering towards their weapons. ||27||
The chariot, joined with a great elephant, with a deep, resonant sound, the lord of the sky, Bhutasvana, mounted, shone. ||28||
1. This is Padma-naga. ||2. That death is skilled in causing fever. ||

## Chapter Sixty-Seven

Thus, other Vidyaadhara kings, filled with joy, set out towards Lanka's lord, enraged and ready for battle. ||26||

The warriors, rushing towards him, their forms like churning seas, met in a fierce clash, resembling the towering waves of the Ganga. ||30||

Then, Rama and Lakshmana, their bodies adorned with the brilliance of pure fame, emerged from their abode, ready for war. ||31||

Mounted on a chariot drawn by lions, clad in armor, strong and valiant, they shone like the rising sun, Padmaabha leading the way. ||32||

Riding a Garuda chariot, his banner bearing the image of the great Garuda, his shadow like a towering cloud, his garments dark as the shade, ||33||

Adorned with a crown, earrings, bow, armor, quiver, and arrows, Lakshmana, his form like the crimson of twilight, shone brightly. ||34||

Other great Vidyaadharas, the celestial beings of Bhaalangkaara-pura, along with the श्रेणिक, emerged, riding various vehicles and flying chariots. ||35||

As they moved, the birds, with their sweet, gentle calls, filled the air, delighting the inhabitants of their chosen lands. ||36||

Facing them, enraged, endowed with immense strength, and swift as a raging fire, Ravana advanced. ||37||

From the heavens, Gandharvas and Apsaras showered flowers upon the warriors of both armies. ||38||

Protected by infantry on all sides, guided by skilled charioteers, the elephants, their forms like the Anjana mountain, stood, intoxicated with pride. ||39||

Chariots, resembling the sun's chariot, drawn by swift horses, guided by charioteers, filled the air with their thunderous roar, moving with great speed. ||40||

The infantry, filled with joy, their weapons gleaming, their formations tightly packed, moved with pride, leaping across the battlefield. ||41||

## Chapter Sixty-Seven

**56.** Dharma protects the vital parts, Dharma conquers the unconquerable. Dharma is the support, Dharma sees everything.

**57.** Even with divine chariots drawn by horses, elephants like mountains, horses swift as the wind, and soldiers radiant like Asuras, a man devoid of past good deeds cannot be protected.

**58.** A man protected by past good deeds conquers his enemy alone.

**59.** Thus, in the midst of a fierce battle filled with valiant warriors, the warriors were so entangled with other warriors that they had no space.

**60.** With weapons shining, many warriors were leaping up and many were falling down dead. The sky became as if covered with storm clouds.

**61.** Maricha, Chandranikara, Vajraksha, Shuka, Saran, and other Rakshasa kings drove back the enemy army.

**62.** Then Hanuman, Chandrarashmi, Neel, Kumud, and other monkey kings like Bhutasvana destroyed the Rakshasa army.

**63.** Then, Kund, Kumbha, Nikumbha, Vikrama, Shrijambumali, Suryara, Makardhwaja, and Vajraratha, the great kings of the Rakshasa side, and their valiant warriors stood ready to help.

**64.** Then, Bhoodhara, Achal, Sameda, Vikala, Kutila, Angada, Sushena, Kalchakra, and Urmitaranga, the monkey warriors, stood ready to support their side and faced them. At that time, no warrior was seen without an opponent.

**65-66.** Just as a great elephant plays in a lotus-filled lake, so too, Anjana's son Hanuman, mounted on a chariot drawn by elephants, was playing in the battlefield.

**67.** Gautama Swami says, "O Shrenika! That one valiant warrior, who acts according to his will, made the great army of Rakshasas like madmen - he made them lose their senses."

**68.** Meanwhile, Maya, the great demon, whose eyes were corrupted by anger, came and attacked Hanuman.

**69.** Raising his arrow, he, whose eyes were like lotuses, showered Hanuman's chariot with fierce arrows. 

Page #76:

Padma Purana
Having mounted the chariot, he again attacked Yudhishthira. His chariot was shattered by the arrows of Sri Saila. ||7|| Seeing him bewildered, Dasamukha quickly created a chariot with his multiform knowledge. ||72|| Mounting that chariot, named Prajvalitotama, the great luminous one, bound the chariotless Hanuman. ||73|| Seeing the monkey-bannered soldiers running, the Rakshasa soldiers said, "He has received the fruit of his actions, the opposite of what he did." ||74|| Seeing Hanuman disarmed, Vaidehi ran. He too was made chariotless by the rain of arrows of Maya. ||75|| Then the king of Kishkindha, enraged, stood before him. He too was disarmed by the Daitya and thrown to the ground. ||76|| Then Vibhishana, filled with rage, stood before Maya. A fierce battle ensued between them, each striking the other with arrows. ||77|| Seeing the armor of Kaikesi's son broken, his body covered in blood, resembling a red Asoka tree, ||78|| seeing Vibhishana bewildered, terrified, and fleeing, the monkey-bannered army weakened, Rama prepared to fight. ||79|| Mounting his chariot, adorned with the knowledge of the gods, he roared, "Fear not!" and with a smile, he rushed forward. ||80|| He entered the enemy army, resembling a dense cloud of rain with lightning, his radiance like the morning sun. ||81|| When Rama was about to destroy the enemy army, Hanuman, Vaidehi, and Vibhishana regained their courage. ||82|| The monkey army, having received strength from Rama, their fear completely gone, again prepared to fight. ||83|| When the weapons rained down, causing the gods to tremble, the world seemed to be another, devoid of light. ||84|| Then Rama, with little effort, showered Maya with arrows, just as Indra showered the demon Vrtra with arrows. ||85|| Seeing Maya completely bewildered by Rama's arrows, Ravana, enraged, rushed forward, his radiance like that of Yama, the god of death. ||86||

In the Padma Purana, 
(10)  The wise Lakshmana, using the Vayu Astra, destroyed the Mahendra Astra in a moment. 
(102)  Then, with his face ablaze with anger, Ravana launched the Agneya Astra, setting all directions aflame. 
(103)  Lakshmana, in turn, countered with the Varuna Astra, extinguishing the Agneya Astra in an instant, rendering it useless. 
(104)  Then, the son of Kaikeyi launched the Papa Astra at Ravana, who countered it with the Dharma Astra. 
(105)  Lakshmana then used the Indhana Astra, which Ravana also countered with an Indhana Astra, rendering it ineffective. 
(106)  Ravana then filled the sky with trees bearing fruits and flowers, creating a dense canopy. 
(107)  Lakshmana then enveloped Ravana in a cloud of Tamasa Astras, darkening the sky. 
(108)  Ravana, in response, destroyed the Tamasa Astra with the Sahasra Kirana Astra and then launched the Dandashaka Astra, its fangs flashing. 
(109)  Lakshmana countered the Dandashaka Astra with the Garuda Astra, filling the sky with a golden glow. 
(110)  Lakshmana then launched the Uraga Astra, a serpent-like weapon, with a roar like a storm cloud, spewing forth unbearable fiery venom. 
(111)  Ravana, undeterred, countered with the Vahana Astra and then launched the Vighna Vinayaka Astra, a weapon impossible to counter. 
(112)  When the Vighna Vinayaka Astra, designed to obstruct, was launched, Lakshmana was confused, unsure which divine weapon to use in response. 
(113)  He then began to launch numerous arrows tipped with wooden shafts, while Ravana continued to fight with his natural arrows. 
(114)  The battle between Lakshmana and Ravana raged with arrows reaching their ears, as fierce as the previous battles at Triprishtha and Ashvagrova. 
(115)  Vighna Vinayaka Astra, M.

The Seventy-Fourth Parva
**Upajati-Vrittam**

When the **karma** (actions) of past lives, which are the motivators, arise, humans experience the fruits of their actions, whether they are **siddh** (perfect) or **asiddha** (imperfect).  ||115||

Those who are consumed by **tiivra krodha** (intense anger) and whose minds are focused on the completion of their tasks, do not consider weapons, fire, the sun, or the wind. ||116||

Thus ends the Seventy-Fourth Parva of the **Padma Purana**, narrated by **Ravishena Acharya**, renowned for its **aarshanama** (ancient lineage), and which describes the battle between **Ravana** and **Lakshmana**. ||74|| 

Page #80:

## The Fifty-Seventh Chapter

**1.** Sweet and cool water is given to those who are distressed and thirsty, this is the law of battle, as ordained by the great sages.

**2.** Food like nectar is given to those who are hungry, and sandalwood paste is given to those who are sweating, as a source of comfort.

**3.** Wind from palm trees and ice-cold water are used in battle, and other tasks are performed by those who are nearby, with utmost dedication.

**4.** This is the law of battle, for both sides, for one's own and the enemy's. This is how the complete fulfillment of duty is achieved.

**5.** Ten days had passed in the fierce battle between the two mighty warriors, Lakshmana and Ravana, both of whom were immensely strong and had lost their wealth.

**6.** The battle between Lakshmana and Ravana was like the battle between Ravana and Lakshmana, meaning their battle was equal in intensity.

**7.** The Yakshas, Kinnaras, Gandharvas, and Apsaras were filled with wonder, showering blessings and flowers upon them.

**8.** Eight daughters of Chandravardhana, the king of the Vidyadharas, were seated on the top of their celestial chariots in the sky.

**9.** The Apsaras, filled with curiosity, asked the daughters, who were protected by their powerful guards, "Who are you, with your divine forms and delicate bodies? It seems you are deeply devoted to Lakshmana."

**10.** The daughters, blushing, replied, "If you are curious, listen. When Sita's Swayamvara was taking place, our father, driven by curiosity, went to the assembly hall with us. Seeing Lakshmana there, he decided to give us to him."

**11.** "Upon returning, he told our mother about this, and from the moment we saw him, our hearts were set on him." 

Page #81:
---------------------------
## Chapter Fifty-Seven

This great battle is filled with uncertainty. We are distressed, wondering what will become of this. ||14||

The fate of this moon among men, this beloved of our hearts, Lakshmana, is our fate. ||15||

Hearing their sweet words, Lakshmana raised his eyes and looked at them. ||16||

Seeing him, those noble maidens were filled with joy and exclaimed, "O Lord, may you be victorious in all ways! May your desires be fulfilled!" ||17||

Hearing the word "victory" from their lips, Lakshmana remembered the weapon named "Victory" and his face lit up. He felt fulfilled. ||18||

Then, with the great weapon "Victory," Lakshmana swiftly destroyed Ravana's "Obstacle-Destroyer" weapon. He was ready for battle. ||19||

Ravana, skilled in weaponry, wielded every weapon he could, but Lakshmana, master of the supreme weapons, cut them all down. ||20||

Then, Lakshmana's arrows, bearing the emblem of Garuda, the king of birds, filled all directions, like clouds covering the mountains. ||21||

Ravana, entering the knowledge of the multi-formed goddess Vidya, engaged in the play of battle. ||22||

Lakshmana's sharp arrows repeatedly severed Ravana's head, adorned with shining earrings, but it repeatedly grew back. ||23||

One head was severed, and two grew in its place. Two were severed, and they doubled in number. ||24||

Two arms were cut off, and four grew in their place. Four were cut off, and they doubled in number. ||25||

Ravana was surrounded by thousands of heads and countless arms, like a lotus surrounded by countless petals. ||26||

His arms, shaped like elephant trunks, adorned with armlets, and his head, filling the sky, became a cage of weapons and jewels. ||27|| 

Page #82:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, 
The ocean of demons, Ravana, grew larger and larger, with thousands of heads like crocodiles and towering waves of arms. ||28||
Or, the cloud of demons, Ravana, grew larger and larger, with thunderous arms like lightning bolts and a terrifying roar, with a multitude of heads like peaks. ||26||
Ravana, though alone, was like a vast army, with the sound of his arms and heads clashing, like the clatter of shields and ornaments. ||30||
"I have fought many before, what can I do against this one?" Thinking this, Lakshmana multiplied himself. ||31||
Ravana, ablaze with the light of his jeweled weapons and ornaments, resembled a burning forest. ||32||
Ravana, with his thousands of arms, rained down a torrent of weapons, including discs, arrows, javelins, and spears, trying to cover Lakshmana. ||33||
Lakshmana, filled with rage and devoid of fear, was determined to cover his enemy with arrows like the rays of the sun. ||34||
He cut off the heads of his enemy, one, two, three, four, five, six, ten, twenty, a hundred, a thousand, and ten thousand. ||35||
The sky, covered with thousands of heads and falling arms, resembled a falling meteor, with a shower of stars. ||36||
The battlefield, constantly covered with arms and heads, shone with the beauty of a lotus pond, adorned with the hoods of serpents. ||37||
As each new head and arm appeared, Lakshmana cut them off, just as a sage cuts off new karmas as they arise. ||38||
The sky, filled with streams of flowing blood, seemed like a new sky, where twilight was being created. ||39||
Gautama Swami says, "Behold, Lakshmana, with his two arms, filled with great power, has rendered Ravana, the wielder of countless arms, a mere body without purpose." ||40||
Behold, how Ravana, the mighty, has been reduced in a moment! His breath has stopped, his face is covered with beads of sweat, and his entire body is filled with fear and anxiety. ||41||
O Shrenika! While he was still in this state, 

Page #83:
---------------------------
The 65th Chapter

A fierce battle ensues. Enraged, Ravana, regaining his composure, contemplates the chakra-ratna, which shines like the midday sun at the end of the world and is capable of destroying the enemy forces. ||42-43||

This chakra-ratna, a repository of infinite brilliance, adorned with strings of pearls, self-illuminating, divine, with a vajra-like face, and incredibly wondrous, is adorned with various gems, divine garlands, and unguents. Its circular rays, resembling a fiery wall, are difficult to behold. It is guarded by a thousand yakshas, always vigilant, and resembles the face of Yama, the god of death, associated with the end of the world. This chakra, after contemplation, appeared in his hand. ||44-47||

The sun, deprived of its brilliance by this radiant divine weapon, is reduced to a mere shadow of its former self, resembling a painted sun. ||48||

Gandharvas, Apsaras, Vishvavasus, Tumburu, and Narada, abandoning the sight of the battle, have gone somewhere, forgetting their songs. ||49||

Having decided that death is inevitable, Lakshmana, though a man of great fortitude, addressed the enemy in a loud voice, saying, "O vile wretch! Why do you stand like a miser, even after obtaining this chakra? If you have any strength, strike!" ||50-51||

Thus addressed, Ravana, consumed with rage, gnashing his teeth, his eyes radiating a circular, vast brilliance, hurled the chakra-ratna. This chakra-ratna, imbued with the fury of a storm cloud, roared with a terrifying sound, moved with great speed, and was a cause of fear for humans. ||52-53||

Seeing this chakra-ratna, resembling the sun at the end of the world, approaching him, Lakshmana, ready to stop it, aimed his vajra-tipped arrows. ||54||

Ramachandra, with his swift Vastravarta bow in one hand and a spinning, sharp-edged plow in the other, Sugriva, bearing the weight of great fury, with his mace, Bhammandala, with his sharp sword, Vibhishana, with his weapon that destroys enemies, 

Page #84:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, Bibhratsuग्रीव, bearing the greatest confusion, held a mace. He was beautiful with a halo of light, and stood at the head of the circle. (56) Vibhishana, with a trident, stood against the enemy. He was born of the wind, and held a meteor, a mace, a club, and gold. (57) Angada, with a thunderbolt, held a sharp axe. The other celestial kings, too, held their weapons. (58) United, they were all eager to die, but even together, they could not stop the Chakra Ratna, protected by Indra. (59) Then, coming and circling thrice around Lakshmana, the protector of the three worlds, the Chakra Ratna, peaceful and calm, willingly rested in Lakshmana's hand. (60) Gautama Swami said, "O Shrenik! I have briefly told you this most wondrous, great, and world-renowned story of Rama and Lakshmana, full of great fortune." (61) When the time of good fortune arrives for one person, great fortune manifests. When good fortune is lost, the time of destruction arrives for another, just as the moon rises and the sun sets. (62) Thus ends the seventy-fifth chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the "Aarya," narrated by the sage Ravishena, describing the birth of Lakshmana's Chakra Ratna. (73) 

Page #85:
---------------------------
## The Sixty-Seventh Chapter

Seeing Lakshmana, adorned with the newly-born Chakra-ratna, the Vidya-dhara kings rejoiced and exclaimed in praise. || 1 ||

They said, "As the Lord Ananta-virya had prophesied, the eighth Krishna-tayuja, the one who is Narayana, has been born. He is the one with the Chakra in his hand, radiating great brilliance. His form is most excellent, he is glorious, and his strength is beyond description. || 2-3 ||

And this is Bala-deva, the eighth, whose chariot is drawn by lions with erect manes, shining like the sun. || 4 ||

He is the one who imprisoned the great Daitya Maya in battle, and in whose hand the gem-like plough shines brightly. || 5 ||

These two, Rama and Narayana, are both Purushottama, born through the power of punya, and bound by the greatest love. || 6 ||

Seeing the Sudarshana Chakra in Lakshmana's hand, the king of the Rakshasas, Ravana, was filled with anxiety. || 7 ||

He thought, "The divine words spoken by the venerable Ananta-virya, the Kevali, seem to have come to pass. This karma, driven by the wind, has arrived." || 8 ||

At the sight of his banner, the Vidya-dhara kings were terrified, and great armies, with their banners and flags, were destroyed. The ocean's water is his garment, and the Himalayas and Vindhyas are his breasts. The three-part earth is his servant, obedient to his command. || 9-10 ||

How is it that I, who am a mere earth-dweller, am destined to be defeated by him? Alas, this is a difficult situation! Look at this wonder! || 11 ||

Shame on this royal fortune, who behaves like a harlot, abandoning those who are long-cherished and virtuous, to consort with the wicked! || 12 ||

These pleasures of the five senses are like the fruit of the Kimpaka tree, bitter in their ripeness, causing endless suffering, and condemned by the virtuous. || 13 || 

Page #86:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
Those men, starting with Bharata, are blessed, the best of beings. They possess a vast kingdom, adorned with the jewel of the Chakra, free from thorns. ||14||
Having abandoned the mixed food, they embraced the Jain vows, worshipping the three jewels, and attained the supreme state. ||15||
Overwhelmed by the extremely powerful delusion, the architect of worldly existence, I, the wretched one, am defeated. I am ashamed of my actions. ||16||
Seeing Vibhishana, Lakshmana, the possessor of the Chakra jewel, born from the womb of the ocean, said to the Vidhyadharas, who are worshipped by the birds, "If you still surrender Sita and say, 'I am alive by the grace of Ramadeva,' then your fortune will remain as it is. For the righteous attain their goal by causing the downfall of the arrogant." ||17-18||
Then, smiling, Ravana said to Lakshmana, "Oh, your baseless pride is in vain!" ||20||
"O lowly one, I will show you the state you will experience. I am the same Ravana, and you are just a dweller of the earth." ||21||
Then Lakshmana said, "What is the use of much talk? I am born to kill you, the very Narayana." ||22||
Then, with a sarcastic tone, Ravana said, "If you become Narayana just by wishing, then why don't you become Indra by wishing?" ||23||
"Your father banished you, and you wandered in the forest, filled with sorrow. Now, you are shameless and claim to be Narayana. I know your Narayanahood well." ||24||
"Whether you are Narayana or something else, whatever is in your mind, I will shatter your desires right now." ||25||
"You have achieved your goal with this blazing Chakra. It is like a great festival for the lowly creatures, even with a wicked object." ||26||
"What more to say? Today, I will send you straight to hell with these wicked Vidhyadharas, along with the Chakra and the vehicle." ||27||
Hearing these words, the new Narayana, Lakshmana, in anger, whirled around and hurled the Chakra towards Ravana. ||28||
That Chakra, at that time, was like a thunderous roar of a cloud, born from a thunderbolt, as dark as the sun at the time of dissolution. ||29||

## The Sixty-Seventh Chapter

**Hiranyakashipu** had attempted to stop the discus hurled by **Hari** (Vishnu), just as **Ravana**, filled with rage, tried to stop it with arrows. [30]

**Ravana**, though he tried to stop it with a sharp club and swift wind, could not stop the crooked discus, as his **punya** (merit) was depleted. [31]

**Ravana** then drew his **Chandrahasa** sword and struck the approaching discus, causing sparks to fill the sky. [32]

The discus, however, struck **Ravana**, who was standing directly in its path, shattering his chest, which was as hard as a diamond. [33]

**Ravana**, like a huge **Anjanagiri** mountain driven by the winds of a cataclysm, fell to the earth, his **punya** (merit) having been exhausted. [34]

**Ravana**, lying on the earth, his teeth clenched, looked like **Kamadeva** (the god of love) asleep, or a god fallen from heaven. [35]

Seeing their master fall, the army, making a sound like the ocean, scattered, abandoning their banners and umbrellas. [36]

"Move the chariot, clear the way, bring the horse here, the elephant is coming from behind, move the aircraft to the side, oh, our master has fallen, what a calamity!" - the army, filled with fear, ran in all directions, uttering these words. [37-38]

Seeing these helpless people, who were clinging to each other, trembling with fear, and whose heads were bowed to the ground, **Sugriva**, **Hanuman**, and the others, reassured them, saying, "Do not fear, do not fear." [39-40]

The army was comforted by the sweet words of **Sugriva** and the others, who had their garments fluttering in the wind, like nectar to their ears. [41]

**Gautama Swami** says, "O **Shrenika**, in this world, bounded by the ocean, there are many wondrous deeds, such as..." [42]

Padma Purana
Dhigi-dashi, Sriyamati, fickle-minded, devoid of the desire for good deeds. This is clearly established in the mind. O people, become possessors of the wealth of penance, become radiant with the brilliance of penance. ||43||
Thus ends the 76th chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the "Ravana-vadha" (killing of Ravana), narrated by the Acharya Ravishena. ||76||
Ravana enjoyed Lakshmi, but due to the destruction of his virtuous deeds, he met this fate. ||42|| Therefore, this Lakshmi, who is extremely fickle and devoid of hope for attaining virtue, is to be condemned. O noble people! Contemplate this in your minds and become possessors of the wealth of penance, become radiant with the brilliance of penance. ||43|| Thus ends the 76th chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the "Ravana-vadha" (killing of Ravana), narrated by the Acharya Ravishena. ||76||

Seeing his brother fallen, Vibhishana, filled with immense sorrow, placed his hand on a dagger to end his own life. ||1|| 

His wives, preventing his death, and striving to revive him, fainted and rendered him great service. ||2||

Regaining consciousness, he was again consumed by the unbearable pain of wanting to die. Rama, with great effort, pulled him out of his chariot. ||3||

Vibhishana, having discarded his armor, fell unconscious on the ground. When he regained consciousness, he began to lament in a way that moved everyone to tears. ||4||

"Alas, my brother! You, the compassionate, the generous, the valiant, the protector of the helpless, the beautiful! How have you fallen into this state of sin?" ||5||

"Oh, my lord! Did you not heed my words, which were for your benefit? That is why I see you struck by the discus in the battle." ||6||

"Oh, god! Oh, lord of the Vidyadharas! Oh, king of Lanka! You, who were always immersed in pleasures, why are you lying on the ground today?" ||7||

"Oh, speaker of sweet words! Oh, treasure of virtues! Arise and speak to me. Oh, support of compassion! Console me, who am drowning in the ocean of sorrow." ||8||

Meanwhile, the news of Ravana's fall reached the inner palace, which was filled with waves of sorrow and grief. ||9||

All the women, their faces drenched in tears, and their steps faltering, rushed to the battlefield. ||10||

Seeing their beloved husband, who was as beautiful as the jewel on the crown of the earth, lying unconscious, they fell to the ground in a frenzy. ||11||

In the Padma Purana,
It is seen that Padmavati's beauty, love, evening assembly, and auspiciousness, Prabhavati's emotional intensity, Ratikantā's mind, and Manovati, etc., eighteen thousand women surrounded their husband and began to weep with great sorrow. ||12-16||
Those who were sprinkled with sandalwood water, many women attained fainting, those whose lotus stalks were uprooted, they were adorned with the beauty of the lotus. ||17||
Many women, embracing their beloved, attained deep fainting, they were adorned with the radiance of the evening line, connected with the mountain of collyrium. ||18||
Many women, whose fainting had gone away and who were playful in beating their chests, were adorned with the form of a lightning garland, flashing like a dense cloud. ||19||
One woman, placing her husband's lotus face in her lap, was extremely distraught and fainted repeatedly, touching her chest. ||20||
They were saying, "Alas, alas, O Lord! Where have you gone, leaving me, who am so timid? Why don't you look at your people who are drowned in sorrow?" ||21||
O King! You are endowed with the virtue of fortitude, adorned with the ornament of beauty, the bearer of supreme fame, like Indra in glory, proud, the lord of the land of Bharata, the chief man, the one who delights the mind, and the king of the Vidyadharas, why are you sleeping on this earth like this? ||22-23||
O Beloved! O Compassionate, O Kind to your own people! Arise, give us one sweet word like nectar. ||24||
O Lord of Life! We are free from sin and our minds are devoted to you alone, why then have you attained this anger? ||25||
O Lord! This moon-like face of yours, which is delightful with the radiance of your teeth, engaged in playful talk, adorn it once again as before. ||26||
This beautiful chest of yours is the playground of excellent women, yet how did this wheel-bearing one find a place on it? ||27||
O Lord! This red lip of yours, like the flower of the afternoon, why is it not fluttering at this time to give a playful answer? ||28||
Be pleased, you have never been angry for so long.

## The Seventy-Seventh Chapter

He who was cast down from the Kalpa-loka and took birth from you, that Meghavahana and Indrajit, is suffering in the bonds of the enemy. ||30||

O valiant one, knowing good deeds, full of virtues, make your brother Kumbhakarna and your sons happy with Padmaabha and release them from their bonds. ||31||

O Lord of life, arise, give a sweet word. O God, why are you sleeping for so long? Arise and perform your royal duties. ||32||

O holder of beautiful gestures, O beloved, O lover of lovers, be pleased and pacify our limbs burning with the fire of separation. ||33||

O heart, why don't you break into a hundred pieces seeing the lotus face of your beloved in this state? ||34||

This heart, surely made of diamond, is a vessel of sorrow. Even knowing your state, it remains unmoved, heartless. ||35||

O Creator, what wrong did we do to you, that you did this deed, which is difficult even for the heartless? ||36||

O Lord, the sweet taste of mutual surrender, which we enjoyed, by just embracing, far away from pride. ||37||

O beloved, what else, when there was a slip in taking the name of another woman, I bound you many times with the girdle. ||38||

O Lord, I, with trembling lips from anger, struck you with the blue lotus of your ear ornament, and the saffron of that lotus went to your forehead. ||39||

O Lord, to destroy the anger of love, speaking sweet words, you lifted our feet and placed them on your head, which immediately melted our hearts. And O Supreme Lord, O beloved, those extremely delightful pleasures, accompanied by sweet words, which we enjoyed with you as desired. ||40-41||

O beautiful one, those acts, bringing supreme joy, are now remembered one by one, burning fiercely in the heart. ||42||

O Lord, be gracious, arise, I bow to your feet. Anger does not look good on loved ones for a long time. ||43||

Thus, even hearing the lamentations of Ravana's wives, whose heart did not become filled with compassion? ||44||

Padmapurana
Then, Padmanabha and Saumitri, along with the best of the celestial beings, embraced Vibhishana, their eyes filled with affection, and spoke words of compassion, being experts in consoling others and wise in the ways of the world. ||45|| They said, "O King! This weeping is in vain, now abandon your sorrow. You know that this is the result of actions. ||47|| Due to the influence of past karma, those who are negligent are bound to experience what they deserve. What is the point of sorrow in this? ||48|| When a person engages in unrighteous actions, he dies then and there. Ravana died long ago, so why grieve now? ||49|| He who was always devoted to the welfare of the world with utmost love, whose mind was always alert, who was wise in the affairs of the people, and whose soul was cleansed by the knowledge of all scriptures, even such a Ravana was led astray by powerful delusion and attained this terrible state. ||50-52|| He has experienced destruction due to this sin. Indeed, at the time of destruction, the minds of men become clouded. ||52||
After Rama spoke, the wise Bhamandala, adorned with the utmost sweetness, spoke these words. ||53|| He said, "O Vibhishana! The great-souled Ravana, while fighting bravely in the fierce battle, met his end through a death worthy of a warrior and attained his rightful place. ||54|| What is lost for him whose honor is not lost, O Lord? Indeed, he is blessed who gives up his life in the face of the enemy. ||55|| There is no reason to grieve for that great-souled warrior. Only those who are like the kings of the earth, who are not conquerors of enemies, are worthy of sorrow. ||56|| The story is as follows: In the city of Akshapura, there was a king named Arindama, born of Lakshmi and Haridhwaja, who was renowned for his wealth, like Indra himself. ||57|| Once, having conquered the armies of enemies stationed in various lands, he was returning to his own place, longing to see his wife. ||58||

The Seventy-Seventh Chapter

Filled with utmost anxiety, Ketu, adorned with banners and toranas, entered the city suddenly with horses swift as thought. || 56 || Seeing his own house decorated and his beautiful wives adorned, he asked, "How did you know I was coming, without being told?" || 60 || She said, "My lord, today the chief among the monks, the wise Kirtidhara, came for Parana. I asked him about your arrival, and he said that you would arrive suddenly today." || 61 || Arindama, filled with envy at the monk's knowledge of the future, went to him and said, "If you know, then tell me what is in my mind." || 62 || The monk said, "You have this thought in your mind: When and how will I die?" || 63 || "You will die on the seventh day from today, struck by lightning, and become a great worm in your own dung-house." || 64 || Returning from there, King Arindama told his son, Pritikara, "I will become a great worm in the dung-house, so you should kill me." || 65 || 

Then, when the son was about to kill the large worm in the dung-house, the worm, fearing death, fled and hid deep within the dung. || 66 || Pritikara went to the monk and asked, "O Lord, why does the worm flee far away when I am about to kill him, as you said?" || 67 || The wise monk said, "Do not argue about this. The creature finds pleasure in the womb it enters." || 68 || "Therefore, do that which is beneficial for the soul, so that it may be freed from sin. It is certain that all beings are engaged in reaping the fruits of their own actions." || 69 || Knowing this state of existence, which brings great sorrow, Pritikara, the great yogi, became free from desire. || 70 || 

The Sardulavikridita

Thus, Bhamandala says to Vibhishana, "O Vibhishana! Do you not know the various states of this world, which is governed by destiny, and which is struck by Narayana, who is fearless and determined in his resolve? In the battle, facing the chief of men, the grieving Ravana, what is the reason for your present state of mind, which is filled with sorrow and self-interest?" || 71 || 

Page #94:

Padma Purana
The story of the virtuous, the one who brings joy, is worthy of being narrated, as it is full of diverse characters and is skilled in giving awakening. All the celestial kings said, "Well said, well said," and Vibhishana, the sun, who knows the highest dharma, was freed from the darkness of grief. 
Thus ends the seventy-seventh chapter of the Padma Purana, also known as the Padmayana, narrated by the sage Ravishena, which tells the story of Pritikara. 
1. From the darkness of grief.

## The Eighty-Seventh Chapter

Then Haladhara said, "What should be done now? For the enmity of the wise lasts until death." ||1||

"Let us perform the funeral rites of the great man, the Lord of the World, who has gone to the other world, with great joy and a beautiful body." ||2||

Upon hearing these words, Rama and Vibhishana, along with Lakshmana and the other celestial kings, went to the place where Mandodari, surrounded by thousands of women, was lamenting like a cuckoo, overwhelmed with grief. ||3-4||

Rama and Lakshmana descended from the great elephant and approached Mandodari, accompanied by the chief celestial beings. ||5||

Seeing them, the women, with their jeweled bracelets broken and their bodies covered in dust, cried out with a choked voice. ||6||

Rama, wise and discerning, comforted Mandodari and the entire group of women with soothing words. ||7||

Then, using camphor, sandalwood, go-shirsha, and other excellent materials, they performed the funeral rites of Ravana and went to the great lake called Padma. ||8||

Rama, with his pure mind, sat on the bank of the lake and said, "Let Kumbhakarna and the others be released along with their followers." ||9||

Hearing this, some of the celestial kings, with cruel hearts, said, "They are very cruel. They should be killed like enemies, or they should die in their own bonds." ||10||

Balarama said, "This is not the way of Kshatriyas. Do you not know the famous code of Kshatriyas? Sleeping, bound, subdued, fearful, and with grass in their teeth, these warriors are not to be killed. This is the dharma of Kshatriyas, which shines brightly in the world." ||11-12||

Then, saying "So be it," the great warriors, armed with various weapons and clad in armor, went to bring them. ||13||

After that, Indrajit, Kumbhakarna, Maricha, Meghavahana, and Maya, the great Daitya, along with...

Padma Purana
Seeing all of them being brought in like elephants, the Vidyadharas, who were sitting together, started talking amongst themselves, as they pleased, saying, "If Indrajit or King Kumbhakarna, seeing the burning pyre of Ravana, becomes angry, or if even one of them gets upset, then who among the monkey army, the king, is capable of standing before them?"  ||16||  "Whoever was sitting wherever, he did not get up from his place, because they had all seen their strength at the forefront of the battle." ||16||  "Bhammandala told his chief warriors, "We should not trust Vibhishana yet, because if he gets to see his relatives freed from their bonds, his sorrow for his brother might cause him to act irrationally." ||20||  "Thus, surrounded by Bhammandala and others, who were filled with various doubts, Kumbhakarna and others were brought to Rama and Lakshmana." ||22||  "Kumbhakarna and all the others, free from attachment and aversion, had attained the state of a sage in their hearts. They were looking at the earth with gentle eyes, their faces serene." ||23||  "They had decided in their minds that there is no essence in this world, only Dharma is the essence, which is the great friend of all beings. If we are freed from this bondage, we will become renunciates and take food only with our hands." ||24||  "Having made this vow, they went to Rama. King Kumbhakarna and others went to Vibhishana." ||26||  "Then, when the conversation about the time of sorrow gradually ended, Kumbhakarna and others, who were embodiments of peace, said to Rama and Lakshmana, "Oh, your courage, your depth, your efforts, and your strength are all excellent, because you have caused the death of Ravana, who was invincible even to the gods." ||27-28||  "Even though he was a great wrongdoer, arrogant, and harsh in his speech, if an enemy has excellent qualities, he is worthy of praise by the wise." ||26||

Then, consoling them with words that touched their hearts, the wheel-bearing one (Rama) spoke, saying, "You all remain together, enjoying your pleasures as before." ||30||
They replied, "We have no need for pleasures that are like poison, terrible, causing great delusion, and bringing great sorrow." ||31||
Gautama Swami says, "O Shrenika! At that time, there were no means left by which they could not be consoled, yet those noble-minded men did not accept the connection with pleasures." ||32||
Although Narayana and Balabhadra themselves were following them, that is, trying to persuade them to accept pleasures, their vision remained turned away from them, just as the vision that is fixed on the sun is turned away from darkness. ||33||
All of them bathed in the fragrant water of that lake, whose brilliance was like the particles of ground collyrium, along with the unbound Kumbhakarna and others. ||34||
Then, emerging from that lotus lake, all the monkeys and demons went to their respective places, as was appropriate. ||35||
Many celestial beings gathered in a circle on the beautiful bank of this lake, and, with minds filled with wonder, they began to tell the story of the valiant heroes. ||36||
Some celestial beings blamed the cruel-acting fate, while others, speechless, shed copious tears. ||37||
Many people, whose minds were filled with the qualities of Ravana, who had come to their memory, were weeping with their throats torn. ||38||
Some were describing the extremely difficult and strange nature of actions, while others were condemning the extremely difficult forest of the world. ||39||
Some, having attained the utmost aversion to pleasures, considered the fortune of the kingdom to be fickle and worthless. ||40||
Some were saying, "This is the way of heroes," while others, who were holders of excellent intellect, were condemning the useless and wrong actions. ||41||
Some were narrating the story of Ravana with pride, some were singing the praises of Rama, and some were discussing the power of Lakshmana. ||42||
Many heroes, whose heads were shaking slightly and whose minds were very pure, were not praising Rama, but were praising the fruits of good deeds. ||43||
At that time, all activities in every house had come to an end, only the children were engaged in stories. ||44||
Then, 1. - Dashruni.

In the Padma Purana,
In Lanka, all the people were shedding tears like rain, and even the strong houses were crumbling with grief. ||15||
The world was filled with water, as if it had become a watery body, due to the tears flowing from everyone's eyes. ||46||
The intense sorrow had taken root in their hearts, and they were terrified by the flow of tears from everyone's eyes. ||47||
"Alas, what a terrible calamity! What a strange thing has happened!" Such words were uttered by the people, along with their tears. ||48||
Some people sat silently on the ground, their faces still, their bodies motionless, as if they were clay statues. ||49||
Some people broke their weapons, threw away their ornaments, and turned away their eyes from the faces of women, like lotus flowers. ||50||
From the mouths of many people, hot, long, and polluted breaths were coming out, as if their sorrow was sprouting endlessly. ||51||
Some people, having attained complete detachment from the world, were taking the Digambara initiation, as spoken by the Jinas, in their minds. ||52||
Then, at the end of that day, the Muni Anantavirya, accompanied by a great assembly of monks, arrived in Lanka. ||53||
Gautama Swami says, "If that great Muni had come to Lanka while Ravana was alive, there would have been great affection between Ravana and Lakshmana." ||54||
For in the land where the Muni, endowed with great powers, and the Kevali reside, the earth for two hundred yojanas around becomes like heaven, free from all troubles, and the kings who live nearby become free from enmity. ||55-56||
Just as the sky is naturally formless and the wind is naturally fickle, so too does the great Muni naturally have the power to bring joy to people. ||57||
Gautama Swami says, "O Shrenika, who can describe how Anantavirya Muni, surrounded by many wondrous monks, arrived in Lanka?" ||58||
He was adorned with many powers,
1. Anantavirya. 2. Sankasha-samyata-dha.

## The Eighty-Seventh Chapter

Sixty thousand celestial beings, great sages, shone there, seated, surrounded like the moon by stars. ||60||

The Muni, seated on a pure, secluded rock, engaged in white meditation, attained Kevala Jnana in that very night. ||61||

O Shrenik! Listen to the wondrous, delightful description of his extraordinary qualities, which dispel sin. ||12||

And then, with the arising of Kevala Jnana, the Muni, freed from the obstacle of Viriya Karma, became the master of infinite strength and ascended the divine throne. From the netherworld, the dwellers of the earth, the Vayu Kumaras, Naga Kumaras, Vidyut Kumaras, and Suparna Kumaras, along with the eight types of Vyantara beings, starting with the Kinnaras, the five types of celestial beings, including the Sun, Moon, and planets, and the sixteen types of Kalpavasis, including the Saudharma, all the Devas from the four realms, had gone to the festival celebrating the birth of a Tirthankara in the Ghataki Khandadvipa. There, they had performed a grand puja and, with auspicious, jeweled and golden pitchers, had bathed the Devadhideva, the Jina, the child, and praised him with beautiful words. Then, returning from there, they had placed the Jina child, who, even in his childhood, was free from childish fickleness, in his mother's lap. After paying their respects to the Jina child, the Devas, filled with joy, returned from Mount Meru and performed the appropriate rituals, like the Tandava dance, at the Tirthankara's home. Then, returning from there, they came to Lanka to witness the celebration of the Muni's Kevala Jnana and approached him. Drawn by the Muni's influence, some of the Devas rode in magnificent chariots, adorned with large garlands of jewels, shining like the sun, and of appropriate size. Some rode on white, magnificent swans, like conch shells. Some rode on elephants whose temples, due to the intoxicating fragrance of their superior musk, were swollen and adorned with swarms of black bees. Some rode on tigers and lions with fearsome faces and teeth like young moons. All the Devas, with joyful hearts, approached the Muni. At that time, the sound of drums,

Puranas

The sky was filled with the sounds of drums, the melodious notes of the veena and the flute, the jingling of cymbals, the roar of conch shells, the thunderous rumble of clouds, the deep resonant sound of the duṇḍubhi, and the enchanting music of celestial maidens.  Seeing the light of the approaching army in the darkness, and hearing the sound of the drums, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were initially apprehensive, but upon learning the truth, they were filled with joy. The army of the monkeys and the demons were in such a frenzy that it seemed as if the ocean itself was churning.  Then, driven by devotion, the celestial beings, including Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, and the demons, including Bhānukaṛṇa, Indrajit, and Meghavāhana, set out to meet the sage. Some rode on elephants, some on chariots, and some on horses. They were adorned with white umbrellas, banners, and yak-tail whisks, and they filled the sky as they approached.

Just as Indra enters his pleasure garden, surrounded by a throng of Gandharvas, Yakṣas, and Apsaras, so too did all the beings descend from their vehicles, leaving behind their banners and umbrellas, and enter the Kusumāyudha garden of Lanka.  Approaching the sage, they paid their respects, bowing down to his lotus feet, and praising him with hymns and mantras.  Then, with a desire to hear the Dharma, they sat down on the ground, their minds focused, and listened intently to the words of the sage.

He said, "There are four paths in this world: hell, animal life, human life, and the life of the gods.  All beings, bound by the eight karmas, wander endlessly on the wheel of suffering, creating both good and bad karma.  They are always consumed by anger and greed, and their minds are clouded by delusion.  These beings engage in killing, lying, stealing, adultery, and the accumulation of wealth, driven by the passion of greed.

The Eighty-seventh Chapter

They fall down below, to the earth-gems, sugar-light, sand-light, mud-light, smoke-light, and great darkness, which are always filled with great darkness, foul-smelling, repulsive, ugly, and painful to touch. They are extremely terrible, like molten iron, and are filled with cries, screams, and fear. There, the hell-beings, bound by sin, due to evil deeds, always experience great intense suffering, like the state of many oceans. Knowing this, the wise, with hearts filled with aversion to the bonds of sin, delight in good conduct, uncorrupted by the rules of vows, and with natural integrity and radiance of virtues, some attain human existence, others, through various austerities, attain the abode of the gods. Fallen from there, they again attain human existence, abandoning their desire for dharma. Those who shine with such merit, freed from rebirth and death, wander in the midst of the vast wilderness of suffering, their hopes shattered.

Then, others, who are established in the dharma of the worthy, are deeply influenced by the words of the Lord of Lords, and following the path of liberation, are intensely devoted to conduct, truth, purity, right austerity, vision, knowledge, and conduct. They strive to destroy the eight types of karma, and thus, endowed with the highest excellence, become the supreme masters of the gods. There, they enjoy countless pleasures, like the ocean. Then, falling from there, they obtain the fruits of the remaining dharma, enjoy great pleasures, attain prosperity, and abandoning kingdoms and other worldly possessions, they embrace the Jain insignia, perform intense austerities, become holders of white meditation, attain omniscience, and when their lifespan is exhausted, free from all karma, they ascend to the highest part of the three worlds, become liberated, and attain the supreme, infinite, blissful, self-nature.

The Story of the Previous Birth

Then, Indrajeet and Meghavahana asked the Muni, the Lord of the Munis, about their previous birth. He replied, "In the city of Kaushambi, there were two brothers born into a poor family." 

Page #102:
---------------------------
The first one was named 'Prathama' and the second was called 'Paschima'. One day, while wandering, Bhavadatta Muni came to that city. ||63-64|| Hearing the Dharma from them, both brothers became small. One day, the king of that city, named Indunama, who was radiant, came to see the Muni. Seeing him, the Muni sat with indifference. He did not show any respect to the king. The reason for this was that the wise Muni knew that the king's false vision was a remedy - it could not be removed. ||65-66|| After that, after the king left, the city's Jain devotee, Nandi, came to see the Muni. That Seth was equal to the king in wealth and the Muni showed him due respect. ||67|| Seeing Nandi Seth hurt by the Muni, Paschima, the small one, tied a nidana saying that I am the son of Nandi Seth. In reality, he was doing Dharma for this very reason. ||68|| Although he was explained a lot, his mind did not move away from that side, in the end, he died with a contaminated mind from the nidana bandha and after dying, he became the son of Indumukhi, a woman with praiseworthy qualities, to Nandi Seth. ||69|| While he was in the womb, many signs of his gaining the kingdom, such as the fall of the fort, etc., began to appear in the places of the kings. ||70|| Knowing this through various means that he would be a great man in the future, the kings started serving him with respect from birth onwards, through excellent messengers and things sent by them. ||71|| He increased the rati, i.e., the love of all people, therefore, the king named Rativardhan, who had a meaningful name, came to be. Such a king that even Indu, the ruler of Kaushambi, bowed to him. ||72||

Thus, the Western brother, having attained great power, became intoxicated with pride and forgot his past. His elder brother, the Eastern one, having performed great deeds of righteousness, passed away and attained the state of a celestial being.  ||73||

In his previous birth, the Western brother had requested the Eastern one, who was then a celestial being, to enlighten him if he were to become a human and the Eastern one a celestial being. Remembering this request, the Eastern one's soul, in the form of a Tullika, entered the house of the celestial being Rativardhan to enlighten him. However, the guards at the door drove him away.  ||74||

Then, in a moment, the celestial being assumed the form of Rativardhan and drove the real Rativardhan away into the forest, making him appear like a madman.  ||75||

Approaching him, the celestial being said, "You have disrespected me. Now tell me, what is your state?" ||76||

Having said this, the celestial being revealed the truth of his previous birth to Rativardhan, causing him to attain enlightenment and become a right-seeing soul.  ||77||

Similarly, Nandi Seth and others also became right-seeing souls.  ||77||

Thereafter, King Rativardhan, having taken the vows of renunciation, attained the end of his life cycle and was reborn in the same celestial realm where his elder brother, the Eastern one, resided.  ||78||

From there, both celestial beings were reborn as the sons of the king of Vijay Nagar, named Urva and Urvas.  ||78||

Subsequently, both brothers, having embraced the religion established by the Jina, became celestial beings once again.  ||79||

From there, they were reborn as the celestial rulers, Indrajeet and Meghavahan.  ||79||

And the wife of Nandi Seth, Indramukhi, having been reborn in a different birth cycle, became your mother, Mandodari, due to her affection and devotion to the Jina's religion.  ||80||

Having heard of these various births, you have abandoned your attachment to worldly things and, with great fervor, have taken the vows of renunciation.  ||81||

In the Padma Purana,
There are great and vast emotions in the Kumhbhshruti Marichavana. Those who have abandoned the Kshaya and Raga are situated in the supreme Shramanya. ||2||
Like grass, they have abandoned the celestial realm and are situated in the practice of Sudharma by the law. These sages, endowed with many kinds of attainments, wander about this earth. ||3||
They are to be known as the great sages, worthy of worship by the Bhavyas, who are bound by the supreme penance in the Tirtha created by the Muni Suvrata. ||4||
Mandodari, who was burning with the fire of grief caused by the separation from her husband and sons, became extremely distraught with great sorrow. ||85||
Having regained consciousness, she fell into a state of great sorrow, like a cuckoo, and cried out. ||86||
"Alas, my son Indrajit! Why did you do this? Alas, Meghavahana! Why did you not care for your grieving mother?" ||87||
"Was it right for you to do this, neglecting your mother who was consumed by intense grief? What work have you done with such great sorrow?" ||88||
"O my sons! You are endowed with divine enjoyments. Now, devoid of the power of knowledge, how will you lie on the harsh earth, having abandoned your bodies and the love for them?" ||89||
Then, looking at the fear, Mandodari said, "Alas, father! What have you done by abandoning the supreme enjoyments? Tell me, how did you abandon your love for your children at once?" ||90||
"Father, husband, and son are the only means of protection for women. Having been abandoned by all of them, whom shall I take refuge in, being devoid of merit?" ||91||

## The Eighty-Seventh Chapter

**The Compassionate One, shedding tears like a torrential downpour, was brought to realization by the noble Aryika, Shashikanta, with her excellent words.** (12)

**O foolish one! Why do you weep? In this timeless cycle of existence, you have been born into various species, from the animal kingdom to the human realm. You have wept profusely, your mind overwhelmed by the separation from countless loved ones. Why do you embrace sorrow again? Embrace your true nature and attain peace.** (13)

**Having received enlightenment from the captivating words of Aryika Shashikanta, who was dedicated to revealing the nature of the world, Mandodari, the bearer of excellent qualities, embraced a powerful awakening. She shed all the trappings of her householder life, becoming completely immersed in pure Dharma, adorned in a single white garment.** (14)

**Having attained the supreme enlightenment, Chandrakha, Ravana's sister, also took refuge in this noble Aryika, becoming a pure Shraman, a widow of vows, filled with intense devotion. Forty-eight thousand women, with noble hearts, embraced the supreme restraint, their radiance equaling that of the sun.** (15)

**Thus ends the Eighty-Seventh Chapter, titled "The Initiation of Indrajit and Others," in the Padma Purana, narrated by the sage Ravisha, as per the teachings of the Acharya.** (18)

**I, a sinner, have been abandoned by all. Where can I turn for refuge?** (61)

**In this way, Mandodari, who was overwhelmed with grief and weeping ceaselessly, was brought to realization by the noble Aryika, Shashikanta, with her excellent words.** (2)

**The Aryika explained, "O foolish one! Why do you weep in vain? In this timeless cycle of existence, you have been born into various species, from the animal kingdom to the human realm. You have wept profusely, your mind overwhelmed by the separation from countless loved ones. Why do you embrace sorrow again? Embrace your true nature and attain peace."** (63)

**Thereafter, Mandodari, the bearer of excellent qualities, having received enlightenment from the captivating words of Aryika Shashikanta, who was dedicated to revealing the nature of the world, embraced a powerful awakening. She shed all the trappings of her householder life, becoming completely immersed in pure Dharma, adorned in a single white garment.** (64)

**Chandrakha, Ravana's sister, also took refuge in this noble Aryika, having received the three supreme jewels, becoming a pure Shraman, a widow of vows, filled with intense devotion. Gautama Swami says, "O Shrenik! On the day Mandodari and others took initiation, forty-eight thousand women, with noble hearts, embraced the supreme restraint, their radiance equaling that of the sun."** (65)

**Thus ends the Eighty-Seventh Chapter, titled "The Initiation of Indrajit and Others," in the Padma Purana, narrated by the sage Ravisha, as per the teachings of the Acharya.** (8)

The One-and-Eighty-Ninth Chapter

Then, the story of the great fortune of Padma-Nabha and Lakshmana, the kings, entering Lanka, is to be told. ||1||

With a multitude of great aerial vehicles, with the sound of the bells of the elephants, with the best groups of horses, and with chariots like palaces, ||2||

With the echoes of the groves, which had deafened the directions, and with the delightful sounds of musical instruments, mixed with the sound of conch shells, ||3||

With the great wheel of the Vidyadharas, the two, the best of the radiant ones, like Indra, entered Lanka, the abode of the goddess of strength. ||4||

Seeing them, the people were filled with great joy, and they considered it the great fruit of the virtue accumulated in past lives. ||5||

When Bala-deva, with his chariot, arrived on the royal road, the business of the city people went somewhere else, as it were. ||6||

The balconies, covered with the faces of women whose eyes were blooming, were continuously adorned, as if with blue lotuses and red lotuses. ||7||

In the observation of those who were agitated with great curiosity, such beautiful words came out of the mouths of those women. ||8||

"Friend, look, this is Rama, the king, the son of Dasharatha, who is adorned with his excellent beauty, like a heap of jewels." ||9||

"He is like the full moon, his eyes are like lotuses, and he is a creation of extraordinary deeds, worthy of praise." ||10||

"The girl who obtains this excellent husband is blessed, and that beautiful woman has established a pillar of her fame in the world." ||11||

"She who has practiced the highest virtue for a long time in past lives, obtains such a husband. What other excellent woman can obtain such a lord?" ||12||

"The woman who receives his help at night is, as it were, the crown of women. What is the use of another woman?" ||13||

"The blessed Janaki has surely fallen from heaven, who, like Sachi, the wife of Indra, delights in this praiseworthy husband." ||14||

Then, Gautam Swami said to King Shrenik, "O King! Now, Rama and Lakshmana have entered Lanka with great splendor, so you should tell the story of that." ||1||

The One-and-Eighty-Fourth Chapter

**15.**  Behold, Lakshmana, adorned with the discus in his hand, who vanquished Ravana, the Asura king, in the forefront of the battlefield.

**16.**  His dark complexion, tinged with the brilliance of Rama's white radiance, and resembling the shade of ground-up collyrium, possesses a splendor that rivals the vast beauty of Prayaga.

**17.**  This is the son of Chandra, the king Viradha, who, through the power of righteous conduct, has attained immense wealth.

**18.**  This is Sugriva, the king of Kishkindha, a man of noble character, upon whom Rama has bestowed his supreme love.

**19.**  This is Bharata, the brother of Janaki, adorned with a halo of light, who was brought to this position by the celestial being, Chandra.

**20.**  Behold, this is Angada, the valiant son, a formidable warrior, who was ready to thwart the Asura king.

**21.**  Look, my friend, at this magnificent chariot, so beautiful, with elephants yoked to it, their trumpeting echoing like thunder in the wind.

**22.**  This is Maruti, the son of Pavan, whose banner, marked with the symbol of a monkey, instilled fear in the hearts of his enemies on the battlefield.

**23.**  Thus, praised with diverse words, and possessing immense strength, Rama and his companions, led by Padma, entered the royal road with ease.

**24.**  Then, Rama, his heart overflowing with love, addressed the woman standing near him, holding a fly whisk, with utmost respect.

**25.**  "Tell me, where in this land does Bharata's sister reside, she who has endured unbearable sorrow in my absence?"

**26.**  The woman, her arms adorned with the brilliance of jeweled bangles, and eager to please her master, extended her finger and said,

**27.**  "My lord, look at that mountain, which stands before you, its laughter echoing through the waterfalls, and its slopes covered with flowers. It is called Pushpa-Preekarna.

**28.**  In its garden, resembling the Nandana forest, resides your beloved, Janaki, surrounded by her family, renowned for their virtue and fame."

**29.**  Then, a close friend of Sita, a woman who always brought joy, adorned with a ring on her finger, spoke.

In the Padma Purana, seeing Chakradhara, who was like Purandara in radiance, Sadhvi Janaki embraced him with tears of affection in her eyes. ||56|| She said, "O Bhadra! As the great Jnanadharas, the Shramanas, have said, so have you attained a high position." ||58|| "You have become worthy of the Chakra-marked kingdom of Narayana. Indeed, the words spoken by the Nirgrantha sages never go in vain." ||61|| "This is your elder brother, Baldeva, who has come. He has shown great kindness to me, who was consumed by the fire of separation." ||62|| Then, Udu-natha, radiant like the sun, arrived, adorned with the Bhamandala, near his sister. ||63|| Seeing him, Sita, filled with joy and brotherly affection, embraced the victorious warrior who had returned from the battlefield. ||64|| Sugriva, the son of Vayu, Hanuman, Nala, Nila, Angada, Viradhit, Chandraabha, Sushena, the powerful Jambavan, Jimuta, Shalyadeva, and other great Kecharaas, having heard their names, bowed their heads to Sita. ||65-66|| With joy, they offered beautiful unguents, clothes, ornaments, and fragrant garlands of Parijata and other flowers, near Sita's lotus-like feet, standing in vessels made of gold and other precious metals. ||67-68|| Then, they all said, "O Devi! You are the embodiment of noble qualities, your influence is renowned throughout the world, and you have attained the highest, beautiful position through great wealth and virtuous qualities." ||69|| "You are the embodiment of the virtues praised by the Devas, you are happy, your body is auspicious, you are the embodiment of victory, you are the bearer of great deeds, O Devi! May you live long with Baldeva, radiant like the sun." ||70|| Thus ends the eighty-ninth chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the Arsha, narrated by Ravishena Acharya, which describes the arrival of Sita. ||71|| 1. Nila-Angada, etc. ||2. This is a mistake, it should be "Jeyam" instead of "Yeyam".

The Ashititam Parva

Then, with the sun-lit lotus face of Sita in his hand, Rama arose.  He mounted the elephant, like Airavata, that followed his will.  The great-souled Rama, bearing the radiance of the Samanas, rode upon the elephant-cloud, whose bells rang sweetly.  Behind him, like the moon, shone Janaki, the Rohini, upon the elephant's back.  With a mind fixed in meditation, he bore a great joy, surrounded by a vast throng of people, and a great wealth of possessions.  He was followed by celestial beings, filled with love, and accompanied by Lakshmana, the wielder of the discus, who shone with a brilliant light.  Rama, the wise, reached the palace of Ravana, like the chariot of the sun, and entered it.  There, in the midst of the house, he saw the most beautiful temple of Shantinath.  It was of a suitable size and height, built with a thousand pillars of gold, and possessed a great radiance.  The walls were adorned with various jewels, and it was a delight to the mind.  It stood in the middle of Videha, resembling Mount Meru, and shone like the foam of the ocean of milk, captivating the eyes.  It was adorned with a network of tinkling bells and large flags, and was filled with beautiful forms, impossible to describe.

Then, Rama, who was as powerful as a king of elephants, with clear eyes and accompanied by the great Lakshmi, descended from the elephant and entered the temple with Sita.  Then, with his arms hanging down, his heart at peace, Rama, having taken the Samayika vow, joined his two lotus-like hands with Sita, and recited the hymn of Shantinath, which destroys sin and increases merit. 

Page #112:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
It is said that when He was born, peace spread everywhere, destroying all diseases and enhancing brilliance. ||14||
Indra, filled with joy and devotion, came to the peak of Mount Meru and anointed Him, whose seat trembled and who was adorned with the highest virtues. ||15||
As a king, He conquered the external enemies with the external chakra, and as a sage, He conquered the internal enemies with the chakra of meditation. ||16||
He destroyed the Asura of worldly existence, which is fickle due to birth, old age, death, and fear-inducing weapons, and attained the auspicious abode of liberation. ||17||
He attained the kingdom of Nirvana, which is unparalleled, eternal, pure, based on the soul, and extremely difficult to attain. ||18||
Salutations to You, O Shantinatha, the cause of peace in the three worlds, the great Lord, who has attained infinite peace. ||19||
You are the Lord of all beings, both mobile and immobile, and are extremely affectionate, a refuge, the ultimate protector, and the giver of the light of samadhi and the three jewels. ||20||
You are the Guru, the friend, the guide, and the Supreme Lord, worshipped by the gods of the four Nikayas, including Indra. ||21||
You are the creator of the Dharma-tirtha, through which the worthy beings effortlessly attain the supreme abode, liberation, which frees them from all suffering. ||22||
Salutations to You, the God of gods, salutations to You, the doer of auspicious deeds, salutations to You, the one who has accomplished everything, salutations to You, the one who has attained everything. ||23||
O Lord, be pleased and grant us the supreme abode of liberation, which is eternally situated in the nature of great peace, free from all faults, and the highest. ||24||
Thus, reciting this hymn, Kamalayatlochan and Shrirāma, who was skilled in virtuous deeds, circumambulated the Shantināth Jina three times. ||25||
Sītā, whose body was humble, who was eager to recite hymns, and whose hands were joined in prayer, stood behind Shrirāma, filled with devotion. ||26||
1. "He who conquered the enemies with the fearsome chakra, and as a king, conquered all the kings,
He, the great one, conquered the difficult chakra of delusion with the chakra of samadhi." - Brihatsvayambhustotra, by Swami Samantabhadra. ||27||
2. "The Asura of worldly existence..." ||28||
3. "He who did not attain..." ||29||
4. "Disturbed..." ||30||
5. "Us..." ||31||

The Chapter of Sorrow

Rama's voice, like the roar of a great drum, was very harsh, while Sita's voice, like the sound of a vina, was very soft. ||27||

Then, Lakshmana, Sugriva, the radiant one, and the sons of the wind, along with others, were all intent on chanting auspicious hymns. ||28||

Those who had folded their hands and had their minds fixed on the Jina, were blessed, and at that time, they seemed to be wearing lotus buds. ||26||

As they released the beautiful sound of their mridangas, the clever peacocks danced, fearing the sound of thunder. ||30||

Having offered praise and prostrations repeatedly, those with pure hearts sat down comfortably in the courtyard of the Jina's abode. ||31||

As long as they continued their salutations, King Vibhishana comforted his relatives, Samali, Malyavan, Ratnashrava, and others, who were suffering greatly. Vibhishana was very skilled in explaining the impermanence of the world. ||32-33||

He said, "O noble ones! O father! Creatures in the world experience the fruits of their own actions, so it is futile to grieve. Focus your minds on your own welfare." ||34||

"You are all seers of the Agamas, with vast hearts and discerning minds. Therefore, you know whether a being born will attain death or not." ||35||

"Youth, which is difficult to describe, is like the beauty of a flower. Life is like the splendor of a leaf, and it is as fleeting as lightning." ||36||

"The association of relatives is like a water bubble, pleasures are like the redness of twilight, and actions are like the actions of a dream." ||37||

"If these beings did not attain death, how could Ravana have come from another existence into your lineage?" ||38||

"When even we ourselves are destined to perish one day, why engage in this foolish grief?" ||39||

"This is how it is," that is, to perish is its very nature. Contemplating the nature of the world in this way is enough to destroy the sorrow of the virtuous in an instant. ||40||

The words spoken, experienced, and seen by good friends, along with the deeds of the virtuous, only cause momentary sorrow. ||41||

Padma Purana
The one who is separated from his relatives, he is bound to be afflicted with grief, which is like a huge force that destroys memory. ||42||
Even though I am wandering in this endless cycle of birth and death, I should consider that everyone is my relative in this world and hide my grief. ||43||
Therefore, with all your strength, devote your mind and soul to the teachings of the Jinas, who are the destroyers of the cycle of birth and death, for your own benefit. ||44||
With such sweet and heart-touching words, Vibhishana comforted everyone and then went home. ||45||
He sent his queen, Vidagdha, who was the most intelligent among a thousand women and was skilled in all matters, to Rama. ||46||
Vidagdha, who knew the proper etiquette, approached Rama and Lakshmana with Sita and paid her respects to them. Then she said, "O Lord! Please consider our master's house as your own and purify it with the touch of your feet." ||47-48||
While this conversation was taking place, Vibhishana himself arrived with great respect. ||49||
As soon as he arrived, he said, "Rise, let us go home and be happy." Thus, at Vibhishana's request, Rama, along with his followers, prepared to go to his house. ||50||
The royal road was decorated continuously, and they rode on various vehicles, including elephants as tall as clouds, horses as swift as waves, and chariots adorned like palaces, in an orderly procession towards Vibhishana's house. ||51-52||
The sound of trumpets arose, as loud as the roar of clouds during the deluge, mixed with the sound of millions of conch shells, echoing in the caves. ||53||
The sky was filled with the sound of various musical instruments, including bhambha, bheri, mridanga, thousands of patha, lampaka, kahala, dhundhu, dundubhi, jhanjh, amlatak, dhakka, haika, gunja, hukar, and sunda. ||54-55||
The sound of halhala, loud laughter, and the noise of various vehicles made the directions deaf. ||56||
The things that have been experienced and seen, only cause a moment of sorrow in the minds of good men, not more. ||41||
The one who is separated from his relatives, he is bound to be afflicted with grief, which is like a huge force that destroys memory. ||42||
Even though I am wandering in this endless cycle of birth and death, I should consider that everyone is my relative in this world and hide my grief. ||43||
Therefore, with all your strength, devote your mind and soul to the teachings of the Jinas, who are the destroyers of the cycle of birth and death, for your own benefit. ||44||
With such sweet and heart-touching words, Vibhishana comforted everyone and then went home. ||45||
He sent his queen, Vidagdha, who was the most intelligent among a thousand women and was skilled in all matters, to Rama. ||46||
Vidagdha, who knew the proper etiquette, approached Rama and Lakshmana with Sita and paid her respects to them. Then she said, "O Lord! Please consider our master's house as your own and purify it with the touch of your feet." ||47-48||
While this conversation was taking place, Vibhishana himself arrived with great respect. ||49||
As soon as he arrived, he said, "Rise, let us go home and be happy." Thus, at Vibhishana's request, Rama, along with his followers, prepared to go to his house. ||50||
The royal road was decorated continuously, and they rode on various vehicles, including elephants as tall as clouds, horses as swift as waves, and chariots adorned like palaces, in an orderly procession towards Vibhishana's house. ||51-52||
The sound of trumpets arose, as loud as the roar of clouds during the deluge, mixed with the sound of millions of conch shells, echoing in the caves. ||53||
The sky was filled with the sound of various musical instruments, including bhambha, bheri, mridanga, thousands of patha, lampaka, kahala, dhundhu, dundubhi, jhanjh, amlatak, dhakka, haika, gunja, hukar, and sunda. ||54-55||
The sound of halhala, loud laughter, and the noise of various vehicles made the directions deaf. ||56||
Many vidyadharas were on the backs of tigers.

## The Glorious Festival

Some were riding on the backs of lions, some on the backs of tigers, and some were setting out in chariots, led by the celestial lords. ||57|| They were accompanied by dancers, actors, and jesters, performing beautiful dances, and by groups of bards singing their praises in loud voices. ||58|| Their banners, adorned with the brilliance of the full moon, and their armies, armed with various weapons, eclipsed the sun's rays. ||56|| They arrived at the palace of Vibhishana, their faces blooming like lotus flowers, bringing joy to the divine women. ||60|| Their radiance, marked by auspicious signs, was a wonder even to the gods. ||61|| Descending from their elephant, honored with offerings of jewels, Rama and Lakshmana, accompanied by Sita, entered the beautiful palace of Vibhishana. ||62|| In the center of this grand palace, adorned with jeweled arches, stood the temple of Padma Prabha Jinendra, shining like gold, surrounded by beautiful palaces, situated in the heart of the Shesh mountain, resembling Mount Mandara, supported by a thousand golden pillars, resplendent, with a suitable height and breadth, adorned with various jewels, adorned with various kinds of beautiful balconies, shining like the moon, adorned with pearl nets hanging from the windows, filled with many wonders, beautiful with various regions like Prati Sara, and a destroyer of evil. ||63-67|| In this magnificent temple, the unparalleled image of Padma Prabha Jinendra, made of ruby, was enshrined, illuminating the jeweled earth with the brilliance of lotus flowers. Having praised and worshipped the image, they sat down in their designated places. ||68-69|| Then, the celestial lords, carrying Rama and Lakshmana in their hearts, went to their designated places, as arranged. ||70|| 
Then, the celestial women, separately, began the ritual of bathing for Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita. ||71|| 

Page #116:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
They were anointed with fragrant, beneficial, and beautiful oils. They were also given a massage with fragrant and body-friendly substances. ||72||
Those who were seated on the bathing platforms, facing east, were blessed with a auspicious bath. Their bath was performed in a systematic and orderly manner. ||73||
Their bodies were rubbed, water was poured, and all this was done in rhythm with the music, which was captivating and accompanied by all kinds of instruments. ||74||
Their bath was completed with pitchers made of gold, emerald, diamond, crystal, and sapphire, filled with fragrant water. ||75||
After bathing thoroughly, they wore pure clothes, adorned their bodies with exquisite ornaments, and then entered the temple and worshipped Padma Prabha Jinendra. ||76||
The story of the food prepared for them is very extensive. At that time, ponds were filled with ghee, milk, yogurt, and other things, and mountains of the finest edible substances were created, meaning that large mounds of food were piled up like mountains. ||77||
All the things that were desirable for the mind, smell, and eyes, which were produced in the sandalwood forests, were brought and collected in the dining area. ||78||
The food was naturally sweet, but what can be said about it when Janaki was present? How can one describe the state of Sri Rama's mind at that time? ||79||
Gautama Swami says, "O Shrenik! The five senses are only meaningful when they experience satisfaction upon encountering desirable objects." ||80||
This creature has eaten, smelled, touched, seen, and heard only when it has experienced the presence of its beloved. Meaning: In the absence of a beloved, acts like eating, etc., seem pointless. ||81||
In separation, even a place like heaven seems like hell, and in the presence of a beloved, even a great forest seems like heaven. ||82||
They all completed their meal with beautiful, wondrous, and multi-colored substances related to alchemy, and various types of food. ||83||
Those who were seated on the ground in their proper places, who were honored, and who were accompanied by their families, were fed. ||84||

---------------------------
All the Vidhyadhara kings, who were accompanied by their beloved ones, were served food.  ||4|| They were all adorned with sandalwood and other fragrances, and with flowers from the forests of Bhadrashala, where bees had made their nests. ||85|| They were all dressed in soft, light, and finely woven clothes, and their bodies were adorned with jewels that illuminated the directions. They were all honored, their desires fulfilled, and they were entertained day and night with various stories. ||86|| Oh, what a jewel Vibhishana is to the Rakshasa clan! He has followed the path of Rama and Lakshmana. ||8|| This great soul is worthy of praise, for he has attained the highest position in the world. What can be said about the glory of the house where Rama and Lakshmana reside, having achieved their purpose? ||86|| Thus, all the Vidhyadharas, who were eager to acquire the qualities found in Vibhishana, and who were free from envy, resided happily in his house. ||60|| At that time, all the people of the city were engrossed in the stories of Rama, Lakshmana, Sita, and Vibhishana, and they had abandoned all other stories. ||6|| 
Then, Vibhishana and all the other Vidhyadhara kings, who had attained the position of Baldeva, and who were adorned with the auspicious marks of Rama, and Lakshmana, who had attained the position of Narayana and who were adorned with the jewel of the Chakra, were eager to perform their coronation. They came with humility. ||62-63|| Then Rama and Lakshmana said, "First, our father Dasharatha had crowned our brother Bharata as king, and he is residing in Ayodhya. He is your master and ours." ||64|| In response, Vibhishana and the others said, "As you say, it is indeed so. But what fault can be found in this auspicious coronation, which is being performed by great men? There is none." ||65|| "King Bharata will surely accept this honor that you are bestowing upon him, for he is known to be very patient and wise. He does not even entertain a thought of any kind of disturbance." ||66|| "Indeed, because of their attainment of the positions of Baldeva and Chakravarti, they have been honored with many kinds of worship." ||17|| Thus, Rama and Lakshmana, having attained the highest fortune, resided in Lanka, like the gods in heaven. ||8||

## The Chapter of the Most Auspicious

**Verse 113:** Gautama Swami says, "O Shrenik! Such a husband cannot be obtained without performing the highest austerities, which are characterized by self-control (dam), charity (dan), compassion (daya), good conduct (sheela), and are performed with the Guru as a witness."

**Verse 114:** "A woman who has not eaten after sunset, who has never blamed an Aryika, and who has not been insulted by a Digambar Muni, is the one who obtains such a husband."

**Verse 115:** "Narayana was worthy of them all, and they were all worthy of Narayana. Therefore, Narayana and those women partook of the nectar of sexual union."

**Verse 116:** "O Shrenik! Neither the wealth, nor the beauty, nor the playfulness, nor the art that was not present in Lakshmana and those women of his, what is the point of talking about others?"

**Verse 117:** "Looking at their faces, one should say, 'What is a lotus? What is the moon?' And looking at those women, one should say, 'What is Lakshmi? What is Rati?'"

**Verse 118:** "Seeing that wealth of Lakshmana and Rama, the Vidhyadharas were filled with wonder."

**Verse 119:** "Here, it seems appropriate to describe the story of the union of the daughters of Chandravardhana and the joyful announcement of their marriage."

**Verse 120:** "At that time, the marriage ceremony took place, which brought together Sri Rama and all the daughters of Chandravardhana, and it was a source of supreme joy for all."

**Verse 121:** "Rama and Lakshmana, who were blessed with happiness through their connection with great pleasures as they desired, were engaged in play with their wives in Lanka, like Indra and his consort."

**Verse 122:** "Six years passed in Lanka for Sri Rama, whose entire sensory faculties were under the control of Sita's body."

**Verse 123:** "At that time, Ramachandra, the possessor of excellent qualities, was so immersed in the ocean of happiness that everything else was forgotten from his memory."

**Verse 124:** Gautama Swami says, "O Shrenik! Let this story be, now listen with a focused mind to another story that destroys sin."

**Verse 125:** "Then, the great sage Indrajit, the destroyer of all sins, adorned with many powers, began to roam the earth."

**Verse 126:** "He, born with the wind of detachment (vairagya) and the garment of right faith (samyakdarshan), consumed the terrible forest of karma with the fire of meditation (dhyana)."

**Verse 127:** "He obtained the most auspicious husband."

Even though he was the chariot-bearer of the clouds, the fire of worldly desires was extinguished for him by the attainment of perfect knowledge, and he attained the nature of the soul. || 128 || After them, the sage Kumbhakarna, who had attained right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, became pure of soul due to the influence of white karma, and he attained the state of a sage who hears the sound of the pot. || 126 || Seeing the world and the non-world with perfect knowledge, he became free from passions and attained the supreme, imperishable state. || 130 || Praised by the lords of the gods and demons, these great sages, with pure conduct, were radiant and bowed down. || 131 || They had transcended the world, having made all objects of knowledge as insignificant as dust to their feet, and they had escaped the bondage of the net of worldly suffering. || 132 || They had attained the state of liberation, which is their own true nature, and they were free from the limitations of comparison and speculation, and they were filled with happiness. || 133 || These and other great souls, who were perfected and had destroyed their enemies, may they bestow the knowledge of the three jewels and health upon the listeners of the Jina's teachings. || 134 || Even today, the places where these great souls resided are visible due to their fame, but the saints themselves are not visible. || 135 || In the great land of the Vindhya forest, where the sage Meghavahana resided with Indrajit, the place is known as the Megha-rava tirtha. || 136 || On the great mountain of Turaga-gati, which is full of various trees and creepers, and filled with flocks of birds and frequented by various animals, the mighty Jambumali, who was full of the virtues of non-violence, etc., attained the state of Indra.

The Darkest Chapter

Maricha attained the state of a Kalpavaasi, and other great sages also attained their respective fruits according to their deeds. ||143|| Behold the greatness of Vaidehi, born of firm vows. How she maintained her virtue and banished her enemies. ||144|| Sita's unparalleled patience, beautiful form, auspicious intellect, and loving bond with her husband are all unparalleled. ||145|| By virtue, she was destined for heaven, content with her husband. Sita adorned the character of Ramadeva. ||146|| Even women can attain heaven through the jewel of a vow, free from other men. ||147|| Even May, who was fierce in his delusion and killed many beings, attained the state of a Vitaraga, controlled his sinful tendencies, and became a great sage. ||148||

The king Shrenik said, "O Lord! I have heard the greatness of Indrajit and others. Now I wish to hear the greatness of May." ||149|| "O Lord! There have been other virtuous women on this earth who were devoted to their husbands. Did they also attain heaven?" ||150||

The Ganadhar said, "If they were like Sita in their determination and vows, devoted to their husbands, and endowed with many virtues, then they surely went to heaven." ||151|| "O King! Those whose souls are unwavering in experiencing the fruits of good and bad deeds, that is, those who experience the fruits of their past good and bad deeds with equanimity, all such virtuous women are equal in their actions." ||152|| "O King! There is a great difference between vines, horses, elephants, iron, stone, trees, clothes, women, and men." ||153|| "Just as not every vine bears cucumbers and pumpkins, so too, O King, not all women possess good character." ||154|| "There was a woman named Abhimāna, born of a noble lineage, who claimed to be a pativrata, but in reality, she was devoid of the control of virtue and attained the state of a wicked beast." ||155||

## Chapter 104 of the Padma Purana

**156.** This mind, like an elephant, cannot be controlled by the weak goad of worldly scriptures. Therefore, it leads the being to evil.

**157.** Only through the teachings of the omniscient, with compassion and happiness as its path, can the mind, like an elephant, be guided by the wise and virtuous being.

**158.** Listen, I will briefly describe the character of pride, a story passed down through generations of wise people.

**159.** In a time when the entire country was afflicted by a disease-ridden wind, a Brahmin from Dhanagramam left his village with his wife.

**160.** The Brahmin's name was Nodana, and his wife's name was Abhimāna. Abhimāna was born to a woman named Māninī, who was the daughter of Agni, and she possessed immense pride.

**161.** Driven by hunger, with his soul distraught, Nodana abandoned Abhimāna. Gradually, Abhimāna reached the forest of elephants, where she found King Kararuha as her husband.

**162.** King Kararuha was the ruler of Pushpaprakirna Nagar. Later, Abhimāna, who had gained her husband's favor, struck King Kararuha on the head with her foot during their lovemaking.

**163.** The next morning, when the king was seated in his court, he asked the learned scholars, "What should be done to the one who strikes the king's head with their foot?"

**164.** Hearing the king's question, many of the courtiers, who considered themselves learned, said, "His foot should be cut off, or he should be deprived of his life."

**165.** In the same court, a Brahmin named Hemāṅka, who knew the king's intentions, said, "O King, his foot should be worshipped with the utmost respect, adorned with ornaments, and honored."

**166.** The king asked him, "How did you become so wise? How did you know the truth?" He replied, "The weapon of the beloved woman's teeth has shown her beloved the wound inflicted by her. I have understood the whole mystery by seeing the woman's teeth mark on your lips."

**167.** Hearing this, the king thought, "This one knows the true meaning." He bestowed great wealth upon Hemāṅka and granted him his favor.

**168.** In Hemāṅka's house, a woman named Mitrayashā, the beloved of Bhārgawa, who was known as Amoghashara, lived.

**Note:** The text uses the Jain terms "Jina" (Omniscient), "Bhavya" (Virtuous), and "Samyaktva" (Right Faith).

The Tale of the Dark Fort
105

The widowed and sorrowful woman lived in that house and taught her son, remembering the virtues of her husband. ||168||  See, son, the influence of Hemaṅka, the sage, who, with a calm mind, acquired knowledge in his childhood. ||170|| You are the son of such a father, who, with his knowledge of archery, surpassed all the Brāhmaṇas, or even Parśurāma. ||171||

Hearing his mother's words, his eyes filled with tears, Śrīvardhita, the proud boy, comforted his mother and immediately went to learn. ||172||

Then, in the city of Vyāghrapura, he learned all the arts in the house of his teacher and, having abducted the daughter of King Sukānta, he fled from there. ||173|| The daughter's name was Śīlā, and her brother's name was Simhendu, a warrior of great strength, who set out to bring back his sister. ||174|| But Śrīvardhita had become so skilled in weapons that he defeated Simhendu, who was accompanied by an army, in battle. He returned home, met his mother, and attained supreme joy. ||175|| Śrīvardhita was a great scholar, and his fame gradually spread. Therefore, King Kararuha gave him the kingdom of the city of Podanapura. ||176||

When King Sukānta of Vyāghrapura died, his enemy, Tināma, attacked his son, Simhendu. Fearing for his life, Simhendu fled his home with his wife through a tunnel. ||177|| He was very frightened and, deeply distressed, went to his sister for refuge. On the way, he met some betel-sellers, and carrying their load on his head, he reached the vicinity of Podanapura with his wife after sunset. There, the king's soldiers captured him and threatened him. Somehow, he escaped and, terrified, entered the forest. ||178-179|| There, a great serpent bit him. His wife, weeping, carried him on her shoulder to the place where Mayamuni resided. ||180|| Mayamuni, the bearer of great mountains, stood motionless like a pillar in the forest, in the posture of a statue. The queen then...

In the Padma Purana,
The muni's feet touched the stone, and Simhendu was revived. ||12||
Having paid homage to the Caitya with devotion, Kesari Chandra, along with his beloved, bowed repeatedly to the muni. ||18||
As the sun rose, the muni's observance ended. Vinayadatta, the devotee, arrived to pay his respects. ||18||
The disciple, having received the message, went to the city and informed Srivardhita that Simhendu had arrived. Hearing this, Srivardhita prepared for battle. ||185||
Then, having been informed of the truth, Srivardhita, with a joyful heart, went to his brother-in-law, eager to show him honor. ||186||
Then, having met with his loved ones, and filled with joy, Srivardhita, bowing respectfully, asked the seated Muni Maya, "O Bhagavan, I wish to know my past birth and that of my family." Then the virtuous Muni spoke as follows: ||187-188||
In the city of Shobhapura, there was a Digambara Muni named Bhadracharya. The king of that city was Amal, adorned with a multitude of virtues. ||189||
Amal, with a noble heart, went to serve the Acharya every day. One day, while going, he encountered an unbearable stench. ||160||
The stench, emanating from the body of a leper, was so terrible that the king could not bear it and quickly walked home. ||161||
That leper woman had come from another place and stayed near the temple. The stench was coming from her wounds. ||162||
She took the Anuvrata from Bhadracharya and, after dying, went to the celestial world. From there, she was reborn as your wife, Sheela. ||163||
The king Amal, having entrusted all his royal duties to his son, was pleased with the eight great vows and became a Shravaka. ||164||
Simhendu was laid near his feet. ||181||
Simhendu, touching the feet of the Muni, touched the body of his wife, which revived her. ||182||
After that, Simhendu paid homage to the image with devotion, and then, along with his wife, bowed repeatedly to the Muni. ||183||
Then, as the sun rose, the Muni's observance ended. At that time, Vinayadatta, the devotee, arrived to pay his respects. ||184||
The disciple, having received the message, went to the city and informed Srivardhita that King Simhendu had arrived. Hearing this, Srivardhita prepared for battle. ||185||
Then, having been informed of the truth, Srivardhita, with a joyful heart, went to his brother-in-law, eager to show him honor. ||186||
Then, having met with his loved ones, and filled with joy, Srivardhita, bowing respectfully, asked the seated Muni Maya, "O Bhagavan, I wish to know my past birth and that of my family." Then the virtuous Muni spoke as follows: ||187-188||

The eighth chapter,
Having fallen from the heaven world, he became Srivardhit. Now I will tell you about your mother's previous birth. ||135||
Once, a foreigner, suffering from hunger, wandered into a village. Not getting food in the village's eating house, he became angry and said in a harsh voice, "I will burn the whole village." As fate would have it, a fire broke out in the village at that very moment. ||166-167||
The villagers, enraged, brought him and threw him into the fire. He died a painful death and became a cook in the king's palace. ||168||
After that, he died and went to hell, suffering terrible torment. From there, he was reborn as your mother, Mitrayasha. ||136||
In Podanpur, there was a great householder named Govanij. His wife's name was Bhujapatra. Govanij died and became Simhendu, and Bhujapatra became his wife, named Rativardhani. In their previous birth, they had burdened donkeys and other animals with heavy loads, causing them pain. Therefore, they had to carry the burden of being tamboli (betel leaf sellers). ||200-201||
Saying this, May Muni Raja, illuminating the sky, went to his desired place. Srivardhit also went to the city, meeting his relatives. ||202||
Gautam Swami says, "O King! In this strange world, due to the rise of past karma, some attain a kingdom, while others lose their acquired kingdom. ||203||
Even after attaining the company of a Guru and Dharma, the path of a being is different due to death with or without a cause. ||204||
Some, filled with jewels and happiness, cross the ocean. Some sink in the middle, and some die on the shore. ||205||
Knowing this, wise people should always work for the welfare of their soul through compassion, self-control, purification of austerities, humility, and the study of scriptures. ||206||
O King! At that time, hearing the words of May Muni Raja, the entire Podanpur was pacified, and the king's mind became calm." ||207||
He became a Shravak, content with eight villages. ||164||
In the end, he went to heaven and from there became Srivardhit. Saying this, May Muni Raja said, "Now I will tell you about your mother's previous birth." ||15||

Padmapurana
Seeing Siddhayoga Muni with tearful eyes and heavy sorrow evident in his very form, Narada asked, "O Kalyani, from whom have you received this disrespect, causing you to weep? The reason for your sorrow is not apparent." ||13-14||
You are the well-known daughter of the great king, praiseworthy, and the wife of Dasharatha, known as Aparajita. ||15||
You are the mother of the jewel among men, Shri Rama, blessed with excellent qualities, and worthy of respect like a deity. The wicked one who has angered you, will be punished by the mighty King Dasharatha, who encompasses the entire world with his prowess, and will take his life today. ||16-17||
In response, Devi Kausalya said, "O Devarsha, you have arrived after a long time, hence you are unaware of this news and are speaking thus." ||18||
"It seems you have become someone else, and your cruelty has increased, otherwise why does your old affection appear so weak?" ||19||
"Why have you not received this news even till now? It seems you are fond of traveling and have just arrived from somewhere far away." ||20||
Narada said, "In the eastern region of the Dhaataki Khand-island, there is a city called Surendra-Raman, where the Tirthankara Bhagwan was born." ||21||
"Indra, along with the gods and demons, performed his birth ceremony on Mount Sumeru with wondrous divine splendor." ||22||
"I witnessed that abhisheka of the Tirthankara Bhagwan, who destroys all sins and promotes virtuous deeds." ||23||
"The gods, filled with joy, danced in celebration, and the Vidyadharas adorned themselves with radiant splendor." ||24||
"Engrossed in the vision of the Jinenadra, I resided happily on that extremely captivating island for twenty-three years." ||25||
"However, remembering this Bharat-kshetra, which is like a mother to me, and the great patience it has instilled in me, I have returned here after a long time." ||26||
"Having arrived in the Bharat-kshetra of Jambudvipa, I have not gone anywhere else, and have come directly to see you, thirsty for knowledge of the news." ||27||

The Eighty-First Chapter

Then Aparajita (Kausalya) narrated the entire incident to Narada. She said that the Acharya, the well-wisher of all beings, arrived with his Sangha. The king of the Maha-Vidyaadharas, Bhamandala, met him. King Dasharatha took the vows of renunciation along with many kings. Rama, along with Sita and Lakshmana, went to the forest. There, he was separated from Sita and met Sugriva and others. In the battle, the lord of Lanka, Ravana, struck Lakshmana with his weapon. The daughter of Drona-Megha, Vishalya, was taken there quickly. ||28-31||

Hearing this, Kausalya, who was overwhelmed with grief, started weeping again. ||32||

"Alas! Alas! My son, where have you gone? Where are you? It has been a long time. Come soon, give me your word, talk to me, and console me who is drowning in the ocean of sorrow." ||33||

"O virtuous son! I, who am devoid of merit, cannot see your face. I am consumed by the fire of intense sorrow and consider my life meaningless." ||34||

"The princess, Sita, who was raised with care and is as innocent as a forest deer, must be suffering in the enemy's prison." ||35||

"The cruel Dasha-Asya (Ravana) has wounded Lakshmana with his weapon. There is no news whether he is alive or not." ||36||

"Alas! My son, who is so rare! Alas! My virtuous daughter Sita! How have you come to experience this terrible sorrow in the middle of the ocean?" ||37||

Knowing this news, Narada threw his Veena on the ground and sat down with his hands on his head, filled with anxiety. ||38||

His body became motionless for a moment. After thinking deeply and looking at her many times, he said, "O Devi! This matter does not seem right to me." ||39||

"Ravana is the lord of three continents, extremely angry, and the master of all Vidyaadharas. Why has he angered Bhamandala and Sugriva?" ||40||

"However, O Kausalya! O auspicious one! Do not grieve excessively. I will go and bring you news soon. There is no doubt about it." ||41||

"O Devi! I have the ability to do this much. Your son is capable of doing the rest." ||42||

Making this promise, Narada, holding his Veena close to him like a dear friend, ascended into the sky. ||43||

---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, 
Seeing the earth with its swift winds and the difficult-to-see mountains, Narada, bewildered, went towards Lanka. 
Approaching Lanka, he thought, "How can I know the news without any means?" 
If I ask Dashavaktra directly about Rama and Lakshmana, it will be considered a fault. What should I do? No clear path is visible. 
Or, I will know the desired news in this way. Thinking this, he went towards Panasarovar with a calm mind. 
At that time, Angada, adorned with excellent beauty, was playing with his inner palace. 
Going there, Narada, with sweet words, stood for a moment asking a man standing on the shore about Ravana's well-being. 
Hearing his words, the servants, with trembling lips, became angry and said, "O ascetic! Why are you speaking such wicked words?" 
"From where did you, a wicked ascetic, come to the group of Ravana?" Saying this, they surrounded him and took him to Angada. 
When the servants told Angada, "This ascetic is asking about Ravana's well-being," Narada replied, "I have no work with Ravana." 
Then the servants said, "If this is true, then why are you happy and showing great respect in asking about Ravana's well-being?" 
Then Angada laughed and said, "Take this deceitful, foolish ascetic and quickly show him to Padma-naabha." 
Being pushed from behind by those eager to pull his arms, Narada, being taken with difficulty, thought, "There are many men on this earth who are called Padma-naabha. I don't know which one is the one I am being taken to." 
May some goddess, who has affection for the Jain teachings, protect me, I have fallen into great doubt.

Narada, whose breath was at the end of his life, and who was trembling greatly, entered the house of Vibhishana, which was shaped like a good cave. ||58|| Seeing Rama from afar, his mind filled with sudden joy, Narada, drenched in sweat, cried out, "Oh, what injustice!" ||59|| Hearing his cry, Rama looked at him and recognized him as Avadvara Narada. At that moment, he said to his servants with respect, "Release him, release him quickly." Then, the servants, who had immediately released him, went to Rama and stood before him, filled with joy. ||60-61|| Narada, whose fear had vanished, sat down on a comfortable seat, having greeted Rama and Lakshmana with auspicious blessings. ||62|| Then Rama said, "You are Avadvara-Gati, a small person. Where are you coming from?" In response, Narada said in order: ||63|| "I have come from your mother, who is submerged in the ocean of sorrow, to bring you news of her condition at the feet of your lotus-like feet." ||64|| "Your mother, the victorious goddess, the worthy and divine Aparajita Devi, is in great distress without you. She washes her face with tears day and night." ||65|| "Just as a lioness is distressed without her cub, so is she distressed without you. Her hair is disheveled, and she rolls on the ground." ||66|| "Oh, Lord! She cries so much that even stones would soften at that moment." ||67|| "How can that mother, who is worthy of praise, a bearer of great virtues, and devoted to her son, be in distress while you, her virtuous son, are alive?" ||68|| "If you do not soon see your mother, who is withered by the sun of your separation, I believe that her life will end today." ||69|| "Be pleased, go, rise, and see your mother. Why are you sitting? In truth, in this world, a mother is the greatest friend." ||70|| "The same thing is happening to Kaikeyi and Sumitra, who are also suffering. She has made the floor of the palace into a small pond by shedding tears." ||71|| "There is no desire for food, sleep, night, or day in her mind. Her well-being is only possible by your separation." ||72||

Padma Purana
The mother, bereft of her son, finds no joy in food, sleep, day or night. ||72|| She weeps like a Kurai bird, deeply distraught, beating her chest and head with both hands. ||73|| "Alas, Lakshmana, my son! Come, revive your mother, speak quickly!" Thus, she continuously laments. ||74|| Grant peace to both mothers, whose bodies are consumed by the flames of the intense fire of separation from their sons, with the nectar-like stream of your darshan. ||75|| Hearing this, Rama and Lakshmana, both brothers, were deeply saddened, tears flowing from their eyes. Then, the celestial beings comforted them. ||76|| 
Having somehow regained his composure, Rama said, "Oh, sage! You have done us a great favor." ||77|| "Due to the rise of bad karma, our mother had been forgotten by us. You have reminded us of her. What could be more dear than this?" ||78|| "In this world, that man is blessed who is devoted to his mother's wishes and, having attained the status of a servant, serves her." ||79|| Thus, with his heart overflowing with the nectar of maternal love, King Ramachandra, along with Lakshmana, greatly honored Narada. ||80|| With a very troubled mind, he called Vibhishana and, in the presence of Sugriva and the radiant sun, spoke as follows: "Oh Vibhishana! In this abode of yours, which is like the palace of Indra, a great deal of time has passed without our knowledge." ||81-82|| "Just as a man, scorched by the rays of the summer sun, always has a desire for a cool lake, so too, although the desire to see our mother has been in our hearts for a long time, today, merely remembering that separation, my entire body is burning with intense heat. Therefore, I wish to grant her complete peace with the water of seeing her." ||83-84|| "Today, my mind is very eager to see Ayodhya, for it reminds me of my other mother." ||85|| 
Then, Vibhishana said, "Oh, master! Do as you wish. Your heart's desire will be fulfilled. May peace be upon you, my lord." ||86||

The messengers are sent to the city to convey the good news. The mothers will be happy to know of your arrival. ||87|| O Lord, O compassionate to the dependent, be pleased to stay in this city for sixteen days. ||88|| Saying this, Vibhishana placed his head, adorned with a gem, at the feet of Rama and remained there until he was accepted. ||89|| Then, Aparajita, standing on the roof of the palace, always facing the south, saw the celestial beings from afar and spoke to Kaikeyi, who was standing nearby. ||90|| Look, look, Kaikeyi, those celestial beings are coming from a great distance, resembling clouds driven by the wind. ||91|| They must be sent by my son, along with his younger brother, and they will surely tell us good news today. ||92|| Kaikeyi said, "As you say, it will be so." While they were talking, the celestial messengers arrived nearby. ||93|| Showering flowers, they descended from the sky, entered the palace, introduced themselves, and went to Bharata, filled with joy. ||94|| King Bharata, overjoyed, honored them, blessed them, and seated them on suitable seats. ||95|| Those celestial messengers, with beautiful minds, told the whole story as it happened. They said that Rama had attained the position of Baldeva, Lakshmana had obtained the jewel of the chakra, and they had both attained the position of Narayana. ||96|| Rama and Lakshmana both have obtained the supreme ownership of the Bharata region. ||97|| Ravana, wounded by Lakshmana in battle, has attained the five elements. Indrajit and others, who were in the prison, have taken initiation. ||98|| Garuda, pleased by the removal of the obstacles of the country-adorning and family-adorning sages, has bestowed upon Rama and Lakshmana the knowledge of the lion-chariot and the Garuda-chariot. ||99|| Great love has arisen for Vibhishana, he has obtained the best of wealth and possessions, and he has entered Lanka. ||100|| Thus, the king, delighted by the news of the rise of Rama and Lakshmana, honored the messengers with garlands, betel nut, and fragrant substances. ||101|| 1.

In the Padma Purana, Bharata, taking those Vidhyadharas, went to his mothers. They, filled with sorrow and tears, were comforted by them. ||101|| The beautiful story of Rama-Lakshmana's mothers and the Vidhyadhar messengers, which gladdens the mind and announces their glory, continued. Meanwhile, thousands of swift chariots, filled with gold and jewels, blocked the path of the sun. Thousands of Vidhyadharas, resembling colorful clouds, arrived, just as the mighty gods arrive at the time of the Jina's descent. ||102-104|| Then, those Vidhyadharas, stationed in the sky, showered a rain of various jewels, illuminating the directions with their brilliance. ||105|| When Ayodhya was filled, in every family's house, there were piles of gold and other riches, like mountains. ||106|| It seemed that the inhabitants of Ayodhya had performed virtuous deeds in past lives, or had come down from heaven, for they had attained such prosperity at that time. ||107|| At that time, Bharata had this proclamation made in the city: "Whoever is not satisfied with jewels and gold, let that man or woman, without fear, enter the royal palace and fill their house with wealth as they desire." ||108-109|| Hearing this proclamation, the people of Ayodhya came and said, "There is no empty space left in our houses." ||110|| Women, whose lotus-like faces were blooming from the contact of the sun of wonder, and whose poverty had been destroyed, were praising Rama. ||111|| At that time, many skilled Vidhyadhar artisans came and coated the floors of the houses with silver and gold. ||112|| They built many beautiful Jina temples and large, magnificent palaces, as high as the peaks of the Vindhyachal mountains. ||113|| They constructed various mandapas, supported by thousands of pillars, adorned with strings of pearls, and decorated with various statues. ||114|| They filled the doorways with large jewels, shining with rays, and erected groups of toranas, adorned with rows of flags. ||115|| Thus, Ayodhya, filled with many wonders and celebrating a grand festival, became like Lanka, the conqueror. ||116||

## Eighty-first Chapter

The city of Ayodhya, destined to conquer Lanka, was filled with wonders and continuous festivals.  

**117.**  On the peaks of the Mahendra mountains, there were countless temples where abhisheka (consecration) festivals were celebrated with continuous music.

**118.**  Gardens, adorned with the finest flowers and fruits, were filled with the buzzing of bees and the sound of rain-laden clouds.

**119.**  Surrounded by beautiful forests, teeming with joyful creatures, the city resembled the divine Nandana forest.

**120.**  The city was nine yojanas wide, twelve yojanas long, and thirty-eight yojanas in circumference.

**121.**  Skilled celestial architects, working for sixteen days, created such a magnificent city that even a hundred years would not be enough to praise it.

**122.**  The city was adorned with ponds, lined with golden steps, and canals with beautiful banks.  These were filled with lotus flowers and other aquatic plants, and even in the summer, they never dried up.

**123.**  The canals, perfect for bathing and playing, were adorned with magnificent Jain temples on their banks and surrounded by rows of trees.  They presented a magnificent sight.

**124.**  Recognizing Ayodhya as a city equal to heaven, the chariot driver, Halaka, announced the departure of the expedition throughout the city.

**125.**  Gautama Swami said, "O Shrenika!  Since the time Narada Muni, who roams the celestial sky, informed them of the news about their mothers, Rama and Lakshmana have always held their mothers in their hearts."

**126.**  All the unimaginable things in the world become beautiful due to the influence of good deeds done in past lives.  Therefore, all beings should always strive to accumulate good deeds, so that they do not have to suffer the scorching heat of the sun of worry.

**8.**  Thus ends the eighty-first chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the "Aarya" (venerable) and narrated by the Acharya Ravishena, which describes the city of Ayodhya.

## The Two-Cooled Festival

**1.**  On the auspicious day, Rama and Lakshmana, the bearers of auspicious deeds, ascended the Pushpaka chariot and departed for Ayodhya.

**2.**  The lords of the Vidyadharas, eager to serve them, set out with their families, mounted on various chariots and vehicles.

**3.**  From the sky, where the sun's rays were blocked by umbrellas and flags, they looked down upon the earth adorned with mountains.

**4.**  They crossed the ocean of salt, where groups of various creatures were playing, and continued their journey, filled with joy, carrying out their playful activities.

**5.**  Sita, the virtuous lady, adorned with virtues, sat beside Rama. She shone with great splendor, like Lakshmi herself. Looking ahead, she said to Rama, "Oh Lord! What is this extremely bright object in the middle of Jambudvipa?"

**6.**  Then Rama addressed the beautiful Sita, "Oh Devi! This is the same place where, in his childhood, the Lord of Lords, Munisuvrata, was anointed by the gods, filled with joy."

**7.**  "This is the renowned Mandara, the king of mountains, adorned with towering, jeweled peaks, which are pleasing to the eyes."

**8.**  "Oh! Due to our speed, the chariot has deviated from its path. Let us go back to the army." Saying this, Rama went back to the army and said, "My dear, this is the Dandaka forest, where the darkness of the clouds of black elephants prevails, and where Ravana, your enemy, abducted you."

**9.**  "Oh beautiful one! This is the river where you and I performed the Parana for two Charana Munis, who possessed the power of Riddhi."

**10.**  "Oh Sulochana! This is the mountain called Vanshasthavil, where we saw the Munis, the adornment of the land and the family, together."

**11.**  "I, you, and Lakshmana served those Munis, removing their afflictions, and they attained the knowledge of liberation, which brings the bliss of Shiva."

**12.**  "Oh Bhadra! This is the city of Valikhilya, where Lakshmana obtained the daughter named Kalyanamala, who is equal to you."

The City of Dasangabhoga
16
Beloved, the city of Dasangabhoga is visible, where the father of the beautiful woman, Vajrashrava, a great Shravaka, resides. ||15||
Looking again at the earth, Janaki asked again, "Beloved, whose celestial king's city is this?" ||16||
It is filled with magnificent buildings like vimanas, and I have never seen such a city that mocks heaven. ||17||
Hearing Janaki's words and looking at the directions slowly, Rama's mind was confused for a moment. But knowing everything, he smiled softly and said, "Beloved, this is Ayodhya. It seems that celestial artisans have created it in such a way that it looks like another city, it has conquered Lanka and is filled with excellent radiance." ||18-16||
Then, suddenly seeing a vimana shining like a second sun, situated in the middle of the sky, the city was filled with excitement. ||20||
Filled with excitement, Bharata, mounted on a great elephant, adorned with great splendor, came out of the city like Indra. ||21||
At that time, he saw all directions covered with celestial beings, situated in various vehicles and vimanas, and endowed with extraordinary powers. ||22||
Seeing Bharata approaching, Rama and Lakshmana, who had brought the Pushpaka vimana down to earth, approached with joy. ||23||
Seeing them both nearby, Bharata dismounted from the elephant and worshipped them with hundreds of offerings, filled with love and respect. ||24||
Then, emerging from the top of the vimana, both elder brothers, adorned with armlets, embraced Bharata with great love. ||25||
Seeing each other and inquiring about their well-being, Rama and Lakshmana, along with Bharata, boarded the Pushpaka vimana again. ||26||
Then, everyone entered the city of Ayodhya, which was decorated and adorned with various flags, in an orderly manner. ||27||
The path was filled with vehicles, vimanas, chariots, and many flags, all moving with great speed. ||28||
Where did Lakshmana obtain a wonderful girl named Kalyanamala, similar to you? ||14|| 

Page #138:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
The sounds of trumpets, drums, and cymbals arose,
Mixed with the roar of millions of conch shells,
And the mighty sounds of bhambha and bheri drums. ||26||
The resounding beat of large drums,
The deep tones of mridangas,
The vibrant sounds of lamps and dhandhus,
All were incredibly sweet. ||30||
The mighty sounds of jhallar, amlatak, hakka, and gunja-ratit instruments,
Accompanied by the roar of haik instruments,
The indistinct and sweet sounds of kahalas,
The dense sounds of halhala,
The sounds of laughter,
The sounds of horses, elephants, lions, and tigers,
The melodies following the sound of flutes,
The various songs,
The loud sounds of vessels,
The recitations of prisoners,
The delightful sounds of chariots,
The radiant light of the sun,
The sounds of the earth shaking,
And millions of echoes,
All these sounds combined to create a grand symphony. ||31-34||
Thus, adorned with supreme splendor,
The Vidyaadhara kings,
Surrounded Rama and Lakshmana,
Who possessed beautiful bodies,
As they entered the city. ||35||
At that time, the Vidyaadhara gods were present,
Rama and Lakshmana were like Indra,
And Ayodhya was like heaven.
How can one describe such a scene? ||36||
The ocean of the world,
Which made sweet sounds,
Beheld the moon-like face of Rama,
And grew in size with the passing time. ||37||
The men who recognized them,
Honored them at every step,
And showered blessings upon them,
Saying, "Victory to you, grow, live, and prosper." ||38||
The women,
Standing on the peaks of their lofty, sky-like mansions,
Their lotus-like eyes blooming,
Gazed upon Rama and Lakshmana. ||39||
They were eager to see Rama,
Whose eyes were like lotus petals,
And whose complexion was like the full moon,
And Lakshmana,
Whose complexion was like a rain cloud,
And who possessed beautiful features. ||40||
Leaving all other tasks aside,
They transformed their windows into lotus gardens,
With their faces,
So that they could see them. ||41||
O King! At that time,
When the women were in close proximity to each other,
Their necklaces broke,
And their breasts,
Like clouds,
Poured forth a rain of milk. ||42||
The paths of Ayodhya were filled with crowds of chariots, horses, elephants, and flying machines. ||28||
The sound of trumpets, like the roar of thunderclouds, mingled with the sound of millions of conch shells, and the mighty sounds of bhambha and bheri drums. ||26||
The resounding beat of large drums, the deep tones of mridangas, the vibrant sounds of lamps and dhandhus, all were incredibly sweet. ||30||
The mighty sounds of jhallar, amlatak, hakka, and gunja-ratit instruments, accompanied by the roar of haik instruments, the indistinct and sweet sounds of kahalas, the dense sounds of halhala, the sounds of laughter, the sounds of horses, elephants, lions, and tigers, the melodies following the sound of flutes, the various songs, the loud sounds of vessels, the recitations of prisoners, the delightful sounds of chariots, the radiant light of the sun, the sounds of the earth shaking, and millions of echoes, all these sounds combined to create a grand symphony. ||31-34||
Thus, adorned with supreme splendor, the Vidyaadhara kings, surrounded Rama and Lakshmana, who possessed beautiful bodies, as they entered the city. ||35||
At that time, the Vidyaadhara gods were present, Rama and Lakshmana were like Indra, and Ayodhya was like heaven. How can one describe such a scene? ||36||
The ocean of the world, which made sweet sounds, beheld the moon-like face of Rama, and grew in size with the passing time. ||37||
The men who recognized them, honored them at every step, and showered blessings upon them, saying, "Victory to you, grow, live, and prosper." ||38||

Leaving all other tasks aside, they transformed their windows into lotus gardens, with their faces, so that they could see them. ||41||
O King! At that time, when the women were in close proximity to each other, their necklaces broke, and their breasts, like clouds, poured forth a rain of milk. ||42||

---------------------------
The festival of Dwadasheetitam was over. The women's mekhalas, nu-pur, and kundalas were falling to the ground, and they were talking amongst themselves. 

Some were saying, "This is Rama, the one who has the virtuous Sita, the daughter of King Janaka, in his lap, the one who has large eyes." 

Others were saying, "Yes, this is the same Rama who killed the wicked Sahasagati, the grandson of the demon king Vritra, who was a thief of Sugriva's form." 

Some were saying, "This is Lakshmana, who has the strength of Indra, who killed Ravana in battle by striking him in the chest with his chakra." 

Some were saying, "This is the mighty Sugriva, this is his son Angada, and this is Bhammandala, the brother of Sita Devi, who was taken away by the gods at birth, then released out of compassion and seen by the Vidyaadhara Chandragati." 

"Not only that, but he was brought to the forest in joy and given to Queen Pushyavati, saying, 'This is your son.' This is the Vidyaadhara king Bhammandala, whose face is illuminated by his divine jeweled kundalas, and who is known by the name Sार्थक. He is shining brightly." 

"Oh friend, this is Viradhit, the son of Chandrodara, and this is Shrishaila (Hanuman), the son of Pavana, who carries the banner with the monkey emblem." 

Thus, the women of the city, filled with wonder and joy, saw these people of great beauty arrive at the royal palace. 

By the time they reached the palace, the two valiant mothers, who were on the roof of the palace, who were full of love for their sons, and whose breasts were full of milk, came down from above. 

The great-souled, virtuous, undefeated Kaushalya, Kaikeyi (Sumitra), Kekaya (Bharata's mother), and Suप्रजा (Suप्रभा), who were skilled in auspicious conduct, came together near Rama and Lakshmana, as if they had met by chance in a previous life. 

Then, Rama and Lakshmana, who were happy to see their mothers, whose eyes were like lotuses, and who were as radiant as the guardians of the world, descended from the Pushpaka Vimana.

## Padma Purana
6
With folded hands and bowed heads, the two princes, along with all the kings and their consorts, approached their mothers and paid their respects. ||57||
The mothers showered them with thousands of blessings and auspicious gifts. The princes embraced their mothers, experiencing an immeasurable joy. ||58||
They embraced them again and again, never satiated, and kissed their foreheads, their trembling hands touching them. Their eyes overflowed with tears of joy. ||59||
They sat down, inquired about each other's well-being, and attained supreme fortitude. ||60||
Gautama Swami said, "O Shrenik! Their thousands of desires, multiplied countless times in the past, have now borne fruit, exceeding their expectations, due to the power of their merit." ||61||
These noble mothers, devoted to the virtuous, with pure minds, surrounded by hundreds of daughters-in-law, and possessing the wealth of Lakshmi, attained unparalleled glory and respect through the influence of their valiant sons and their own accumulated merit. ||62-63||
They ruled the earth, extending from the salt sea to the horizon, unopposed, granting commands as they pleased, adorned with a single umbrella. ||64||
Gautama Swami said, "Whoever, with a pure mind, hears or reads this account of the auspicious reunion, will attain desired wealth, a long life, and great merit." ||65||
Even a single rule followed by a person of good intellect leads to progress and shines brightly like the sun. Therefore, O noble ones, follow this rule. ||66||
Thus ends the Vyasiṣṭha Parva, the eighty-second chapter of the Padma Purana, narrated by the venerable Raviṣena Acharya, known as the Ārṣa. ||82||

The Triyasititama Festival

Again bowing his head, the king Shrenika asked the sage, "O venerable one, how was the wealth and prosperity in the house of Rama and Lakshmana?" ||3||

Gautama said, "O king, although the pleasures of Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna cannot be fully described, yet, O king, I will tell you in brief about the wealth that arose due to the influence of Balabhadra and Narayana. Listen." ||2-3||

Their dwelling, called Nandyaavarta, was like the abode of Indra, beautiful, with many gates and high gopuras. ||4||

There was a fort called Chatuhshala, as high as the peaks of a great mountain, and a hall called Vaijayanti. There was a beautiful hall called Suvithi, made of moonstone, and a very high prasadakuta, overlooking all directions. There was a viewing hall called Vardhamana, as high as the Vindhya mountain, and offices equipped with various tools. Their inner sanctum was as wondrous as a hen's egg, standing on a single pillar, and as beautiful as a Kalpavriksha. ||5||

Surrounding this inner sanctum was a row of palaces belonging to the queens, known as Tarangali, shining with jewels. ||6||

There was a bedroom called Ambhojakanda, with the brilliance of lightning, a beautiful, soft-touch bed, resting on lion-head feet. There was a magnificent throne, like the rising sun, and fans like clusters of moonbeams. ||10-11||

There was a large, heavy umbrella, radiating the brilliance of the moon, providing shade as desired. There were two sandals called Vishamochika, for comfortable walking. ||12||

There were priceless garments, divine ornaments, an impenetrable armor, a pair of shining jeweled earrings, unfailing maces, swords, gold, discs, arrows, and other great things that shone on the battlefield. ||13-14||

Padma Purana
Fifty lakh ploughs were there, more than a crore of self-milking cows. ||15|| The number of families residing in Ayodhya, who were holders of immense wealth and constantly engaged in righteousness, was slightly more than seventy crore. ||16|| All the houses of the householders were extremely white, of various shapes, filled with inexhaustible treasuries and adorned with jewels. ||17|| The outer regions of the city, filled with various types of grains, appeared like small round mountains, and the four-storied buildings with paved floors were extremely pleasant. ||18|| There were many beautiful gardens, situated in the midst of excellent gardens, adorned with various types of flowers, with excellent staircases and suitable for recreation. ||19|| The householders, adorned with groups of beautiful cows and buffaloes, were filled with great happiness and were shining like the best gods. ||20|| The chieftains, who were like the protectors of the people, were said to be like the Lokapalas, and the kings, who were holders of immense brilliance, were endowed with splendor like that of Mahendra. ||21|| There were many beautiful women, like Apsaras, who were the land of worldly happiness, and there were many instruments that gave happiness according to one's desires. ||22|| Just as before, this Bharat region had attained supreme beauty through Harishena, the king who wore the Chakra Ratna, so too this Bharat region had attained supreme beauty through Rama. ||23|| Sri Ramadeva had built thousands of Chaityalayas, which were constantly worshipped by the wealthy and noble people who possessed immense wealth. ||24|| The people residing in the country, villages, cities, forests, houses and streets, were happy and formed circles, constantly discussing this. ||25|| Look, this entire Saketa country is now ready to attain the status of a wondrous heaven. ||26|| In the middle of this country, Ayodhyapuri is shining like the city of Indra, with tall buildings that are impossible to describe. ||27|| Seeing those large schools, one wonders whether they are the play-grounds of the gods, surrounded by brilliance, or a group of autumn clouds. ||28|| The rampart of this city is illuminating all directions, extremely high, like the platform of the ocean, and adorned with large peaks. ||29||

## The Most Glorious City

A city adorned with a wealth of gold and jewels, its radiance illuminating the sky, a city whose splendor surpasses even the imagination. Such was Ayodhya, a city unmatched in the three worlds. (30)

This auspicious city, filled with virtuous souls, seems to have been transformed by Ramadeva himself, surpassing all others in beauty. (31)

They say there is a beautiful place called heaven, and it seems as if Rama and Lakshmana have brought that heaven with them. (32)

Or perhaps this is the same ancient city of Uttar Kosala, now inaccessible to those devoid of virtue. (33)

It seems that Ramachandra has brought this city, along with its inhabitants, their wives, animals, and wealth, to a state of splendor akin to heaven. (34)

There is one major flaw in this city, a source of great shame and disgrace, something that virtuous men would find unbearable to endure. (35)

The flaw lies in the fact that Ravana, the king of the Vidyadharas, abducted Sita and surely enjoyed her. Now that Sita has been brought back, is it right for Rama to accept her? (36)

People, behold! When this is the act of a Kshatriya, a noble, a wise and honorable man, what can be said of others? (37)

Thus, the slander against Sita, fueled by the actions of petty minds, has spread far and wide, rooted in her past karma. (38)

Meanwhile, Bharata, residing in this city that shames heaven, finds no joy even in the pleasures fit for Indra. (39)

Though he is the lord of a hundred and fifty wives, he constantly harbors resentment towards the lofty glory of his kingdom. (40)

This city is adorned with magnificent palaces, their roofs, towers, and doorways radiating a captivating brilliance, arranged in orderly rows. (41)

The floors are crafted from a mosaic of colorful gems, the courtyards are beautiful, the city is adorned with garlands of pearls and gold, and the trees are laden with blossoms. (42)

This city is filled with wonders, captivating the senses, a place of music and dance, teeming with beautiful women, and a haven for the intoxicated. (43) 

Page #144:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
There was a beautiful elephant, adorned with a garland of flowers,
Whose body was fragrant with musk, and whose trumpeting was like the neighing of horses.
The place was filled with sweet music, and adorned with a canopy of jewels,
A delightful place for play, even for the gods.
The king, overwhelmed with fear of the world,
Could not find courage, like a deer frightened by a hunter.
Human life, obtained with great difficulty, is fickle like a drop of water,
Youth is like a bubble, fragile and full of troubles.
Pleasures are tasteless at the end, life is like a dream,
And the bond with relatives is like the gathering of birds.
He who, having realized this, does not practice Dharma, which brings happiness,
Will be consumed by sorrow in his old age, like a withered tree.
What is the use of attachment to youth, which is a fool's beloved,
A dwelling place of slander, and fleeting like the evening light?
It is necessary to abandon this body, which is a house of many diseases,
Whose root is semen and blood, what pleasure can there be in this machine?
Just as fire is not satisfied with fuel, and the ocean is not satisfied with water,
So too, this being is not satisfied with worldly pleasures, even when enjoyed.
The mind attached to desires is sinful, and does not understand anything,
Like a greedy moth, it suffers terrible pain.
What pleasure can there be in these breasts, which are like goiters,
And constantly dripping with sweat, these disgusting lumps of flesh?
What beauty is there in this mouth, which is full of teeth like insects,
And stained with the red juice of betel, like a cut made by a razor?
The actions of women, born of wind-like defects, or caused by madness,
Even when called playful, what pleasure can there be in them?
Music and weeping are the same as the sound of a house,
They do not differ in the mind that dwells in courage.

The Most Auspicious Festival
12.
What pleasure can a man derive from the service of women whose bodies are defiled by impurities and who are covered only in skin? ||5|| A foolish mind, taking two earthen pots, considers the union of the two as a source of happiness. ||56|| How can one who is not satisfied by the vast array of divine pleasures born of mere desire be satisfied by the paltry pleasures of human existence? ||60|| A firewood seller does not find satisfaction in the dew drops on blades of grass in the forest, he only finds toil. ||61|| Similarly, the king, not satisfied with the wealth of his kingdom, engages in such an evil act as the consumption of human flesh. ||62|| Just as crows, greedy for flesh, enter the flowing Ganges and, while devouring the carcass of a dead elephant, do not find satisfaction and ultimately perish in the ocean, so too, beings of the world, not finding satisfaction in worldly pleasures, ultimately drown in the ocean of existence. ||63|| O Atman! Your subjects, like frogs, are trapped in the mud of delusion and are being dragged into the hole of hell by the fierce serpent of greed. ||64|| Thus, many days passed for the dispassionate Bharata, whose mind was peaceful, as he contemplated the obstacles to his initiation. ||65|| Just as a lion, though powerful, suffers in a cage, so too, Bharata, though capable of performing the initiation rites, suffers, not having attained the Jain vows, which destroy all suffering. ||66|| The peaceful-hearted Bharata was earnestly entreated by his mother, Kaikeyi, to stay.  Rama and Lakshmana, filled with affection, held him back and said, "Brother, your father, desiring your welfare, had established you as the king of the entire earth. ||67-68|| Since your father had definitely crowned you to rule the world, you are our master as well. Therefore, you should rule the world." ||69|| "This Sudarshana Chakra and these Vidhyadhara kings are at your command, so enjoy this earth as your wife." ||70|| I myself will hold your white umbrella, and Lakshmana, the minister, will hold your fly whisk. ||71||

Padma Purana
Even after being told this, if you do not follow my words, then I will go to the forest today, just like a deer. 72
Having conquered Ravana, the jewel of the Rakshasa lineage, we have come here driven by the thirst for the happiness of seeing you. 73
Enjoy this kingdom, free from obstacles, for now. Later, you will enter the forest of penance with us. 74
Bharata, whose heart was completely free from worldly desires, was eager to speak and said to Rama, who was the possessor of a good heart: 75
O God! I wish to quickly abandon this royal fortune, which has been abandoned by those who have attained liberation by performing great penance. 76
O King! These desires and wealth are fickle, obtained through suffering, served by the most foolish people, and hated by the wise. 77
O Halayudha! Even if these perishable pleasures are like the heavenly realm or resemble the ocean, I have no desire for them. 78
O King! I wish to cross this ocean of the world, which is extremely terrifying, extends to the underworld of death, is filled with waves of birth, has large waves of pleasure and displeasure, is full of large crocodiles of attachment and aversion, and is terrifying due to various kinds of suffering, by boarding a boat of vows. 79-80
O King! I have become weary, having experienced the unbearable suffering of being born in various wombs, wandering repeatedly in different species. 81
Hearing these words of Bharata, the kings, whose eyes were filled with tears, were filled with wonder and spoke with trembling voices: O King! Accept your father's words and protect the world. If you do not like Lakshmi, then become a sage after some time. 82-83
Bharata replied: I have fully followed my father's words, protected the world for a long time, and honored the abundance of pleasures. 84
I have given the supreme gift, satisfied the community of the virtuous. Now I wish to do what my father did. 85
Why don't you all give me your approval today? As it is, one should be connected with a worthy cause. 86
I wear a white umbrella like the moon, Shatrughna carries a fly whisk, and Lakshmana is your minister. 71

The most glorious festival
Having conquered the enemy forces in a fierce battle with a multitude of elephants, the Lakshmi you have earned is like that of Nanda, Balabhadra, and Narayana.  || 87 ||  Even though it is great, it is not capable of giving me satisfaction.  Like the Ganga, it is unable to satisfy the ocean, so I am now turning to the path of truth. || 88 || 

Having said this, and having asked them, Bharat, filled with intense emotion, rose from his throne in a hurry, like Bharat Chakravarti. || 86 || 

As Bharat, with his graceful gait, was about to leave for the forest, Lakshmana, with affection and concern, stopped him, taking hold of his hand. || 10 || 

As Bharat, with his hand, pushed aside Lakshmana's hand, he consoled his mother, who was shedding tears like a river.  Meanwhile, by Rama's command, the women, whose beauty was like Lakshmi's, arrived and wept for Bharat.  Their eyes, like lotus petals, trembled in the wind. || 61-62 || 

In the meantime, Sita, the embodiment of Lakshmi herself, Urvi, Bhanumati, Vishalya, Sundari, Aindri, Ratnawati, Lakshmi, Gunavati (who bore a meaningful name), Kanta, Bandhumati, Bhadra, Kauberi, Nalakuvara, Kalyanamala, Chandrini, Manosatsava, Manorama, Priyananda, Chandrakala, Kalavati, Ratnastheli, Suravati, Shrikala, Gunasagara, Padmavati, and many other women of the two brothers, whose descriptions are impossible, arrived there. || 63-66 || 

The form of all those women was captivating, they were adorned with divine garments and ornaments, they were the source of many auspicious events, they were born of love, they were eager to show the fruits of all the arts, they stood around, they were beautiful, they were eager to charm, they had beautiful voices, and they had the radiance of a group of lotus flowers trembling in the wind.  They all said to Bharat with great respect, || 67-69 || 

"Brother-in-law! Please grant us a great favor.  We want to play in the water with you." || 100 || 

"O Lord! Abandon all other worries that trouble your mind, and do what is pleasing to this group of your brother's wives." || 101 || 

Page #148:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
Even though all those women surrounded Bharat, his mind did not become attached to any kind of desire. He only accepted their request out of kindness. || 102 ||
After receiving the order, the wives of Rama, Lakshmana, and Bharat became free from doubt and attained supreme joy. || 103 ||
Then, surrounded by those women with beautiful movements and lotus-like eyes, Bharat descended into the magnificent lake. || 104 ||
His mind was absorbed in the contemplation of the truth, and he was indifferent to play. Bharat only entered the water at the request of the women. || 105 ||
Surrounded by the women and filled with humility, Bharat shone upon reaching the lake, like the lord of a herd of elephants. || 106 ||
Three fragrant, beautiful, and smooth garments were applied to Bharat's body, which colored the water with their vast brilliance. || 107 ||
Engaged in excellent activities and extremely charming, King Bharat, after playing a little and bathing well, emerged from the lake. || 108 ||
Bharat, who had performed a great worship of the Arhant with lotuses and blue lotuses, was adorned by the group of those respectful women. || 109 ||
Meanwhile, the famous elephant king, Trilokamandan, who resembled a great cloud, broke the pillar and emerged from his dwelling. At that time, he was making a terrifying sound and showering the sky with the water of his rut. || 110 - 111 ||
Hearing his roar, which was like the dense, vast roar of a cloud, the entire city of Ayodhya became as if all its people were mad. || 112 ||
The city's roads were filled with elephants, driven by mahoutas who were exhausted from running around, their ears and eyes fixed in fear due to the pushing and shoving caused by the crowd. || 113 ||
Those terrifying, rutting elephants, who could capture the speed of horses, scattered in all ten directions as they pleased. || 114 ||
Breaking the golden and jeweled, mountain-like tower, the Trilokamandan elephant, whose tusks were large and made of gold and jewels,

The Chapter of Deep Meditation

The women, their eyes filled with fear, were gathered in great confusion. They approached Bharata for protection, just as rays of light approach the sun. ||16|| Seeing the elephant king approaching Bharata, the people cried out in lament, "Alas, alas!" ||17|| The mothers, filled with great anxiety and love for their son, were deeply distressed and bewildered. ||118|| At that time, Rama and Lakshmana, armed with cunning and great knowledge, approached the terrified Vidhyadhara elephant drivers, ready to seize the extremely agile elephant king by force. ||119-120|| The elephant king roared angrily, was terrible to behold, powerful, swift, and could not be restrained even by naga-pasas (snares). ||121||

Then, seeing the glorious Kamalalocana Bharata standing at the end of the women, the elephant remembered his previous life. ||122|| Overwhelmed with great anxiety, the elephant lowered his trunk and stood before Bharata in humility. ||123|| Bharata spoke to him in sweet words, "Oh, elephant king! Why are you filled with anger?" ||124|| Hearing Bharata's words, the elephant regained his senses, became extremely peaceful, his restlessness vanished, and his appearance became very gentle. ||125|| The elephant looked at the affectionate Bharata standing before the best of women, as if he were looking at Indra seated amidst a group of apsaras in heaven. ||126||

Then, the wise elephant, who was letting out long sighs, was filled with this kind of anxiety, free from any disturbance. ||127|| He thought, "This is the same one who was my best friend, a god in the Brahmottara heaven, shining like the moon. ||128|| He has fallen from there and, due to his remaining merit, has become a great man. Alas, I have committed a sinful act and been born in this animal form. ||129|| I have been deprived of the ability to discern right and wrong. How have I become an elephant? Alas, what a shame!" ||130||

Bharata was present there, and the elephant went towards him. ||115||

## Padma Purana

**13.** Why should I grieve now, remembering the past? I will perform actions that will benefit my soul.

**132.** Worrying is not the cause of liberation from suffering. Therefore, I will embrace the path that leads to liberation with full reverence.

**133.** The elephant, known as Upendravajra, who remembered his past lives, had attained great detachment from the world. His soul was completely turned away from sinful actions, and he was focused on accumulating virtuous deeds. He sat peacefully before the ornament of the three worlds, the elephant Bharata.

**134.** Gautama Swami said, "O King! The evil deeds done in past lives cause intense suffering later. Therefore, O noble ones! Perform virtuous deeds, for it is not right to stumble while the sun is shining."

Thus ends the eighty-third chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the **Tribhuvanalankarakshobha**, narrated by the sage Ravishena, which describes the distress of the elephant, the ornament of the three worlds.

**130.** How did this elephant become a parable? Alas, this sinful act is to be condemned!

## Chapter 48

**Verse 1:**
The valiant, humble, best of the two-legged, contemplating thus, was filled with utmost wonder as he beheld the lotus-like chakra in the hands of the elephant.

**Verse 2:**
With a little strength, Rama and Lakshmana, filled with some doubt, slowly approached and seized the elephant, who was beloved for his sweet speech.

**Verse 3:**
Having received the command of Narayana, and with great joy, the others adorned the elephant with all ornaments and offered him great respect.

**Verse 4:**
With the great elephant calmed, the city, freed from its anxiety, shone like the autumn season, devoid of the dark clouds.

**Verse 5:**
His extremely fierce speed could not be stopped even by the kings of the Vidyadharas or the most powerful gods.

**Verse 6:**
How was this former vehicle of Ravana, who could shake Kailasa, stopped by Rama and Lakshmana?

**Verse 7:**
Having attained such a state of tranquility after experiencing such a transformation, it should be understood that this is due to the merit of his past life, which brings long life.

**Verse 8:**
Thus, in the entire city, people were filled with utmost wonder, and there was a lot of talk, with people shaking their heads and hands.

**Verse 9:**
Then, along with Sita and Vishalya, Bharat, the bearer of great fortune, mounted the elephant and set out for home.

**Verse 10:**
The remaining women, adorned with the finest ornaments and riding various vehicles, surrounded Bharat.

**Verse 11:**
Shatrughna, riding a chariot drawn by horses, filled with supreme glory, was in front of Bharat.

**Verse 12:**
The sound of the great instruments like Kamla, Amla, and drums, mixed with the sound of conch shells, created a loud commotion.

**Verse 13:**
Just as the gods leave the Nandana forest and reach their beautiful heaven, so too did they leave the Kusumamoda garden, filled with the fragrance of flowers, and reach their beautiful home.

**Verse 14:**
Then, the king Bharat, with pure intellect, dismounted the elephant, entered the dining hall, and respectfully served the sages.

He ate with his friends, ministers, and brothers-in-law. Then everyone went to their respective places. ||15|| Why did the Triloka-Mandana elephant become angry? How did he become calm? Why did he go to Bharata? What is all this? Thus, the elephant-related stories never ceased. ||16|| Then, Gautama Swami said, "O Shrenik! All the Mahamats came and, bowing respectfully, said to Ram and Lakshman, ||17|| "O Dev! Oh! It has been four days since the Triloka-Mandana elephant, having abandoned all his duties and with a weakened body, ||18|| has become calm after experiencing agitation. From that moment, he has been absorbed in meditation. ||19|| With his eyes closed, he breathes deeply, agitated, and, after meditating for a long time, he strikes the earth with his trunk. ||20|| Although he is constantly praised with hundreds of sweet hymns, he does not take a bite and does not make a sound in his ears, meaning he does not listen to anything. ||21|| With his eyes closed, he keeps his trunk on the front of his teeth, standing still, as if he were a statue of an elephant. ||22|| Is this a fake elephant, or is it a real Mahagajraj? Thus, people keep arguing about him. ||23|| Even if he takes a bite due to sweet words, he releases it before it reaches his mouth, even if it is a delicious morsel. ||24|| Abandoning the play of the three-footed elephant, he stands, filled with sorrow, leaning against a pillar, taking a deep breath. ||25|| Even renowned physicians, whose minds are purified by the respect of all scriptures, cannot understand his intentions. ||26|| This elephant, whose mind is fixed on something else, does not listen to the very beautiful music composed with great care, as he did before. ||27|| Even though he is treated with great love and affection, he does not regain his health through auspicious rituals, amusements, yoga, mantras, knowledge, or medicines. ||28|| Like a friend who has attained liberation, even when requested, he does not engage in entertainment, sleep,

**The Mystery of the Elephant**

**30.** This profound and wondrous secret, difficult to comprehend, resides in the elephant's mind. We do not know what it is.

**31.** This elephant cannot be satisfied, nor does it ever desire anything. It does not even experience anger, just like a painted image.

**32.** O Lord! This elephant, with its wondrous prowess, is the root cause of this entire kingdom. O Lord! This elephant, an ornament of the three worlds, is like a Karati (a type of elephant).

**33.** O Lord! Having understood this, you are the authority on this matter. We, with our limited intellect, can only make requests.

**34.** Hearing the elephant's previous actions, which were vastly different from its current behavior, Rama, Lakshmana, and the king were deeply troubled for a moment.

**35.** "Why did this elephant escape from its confinement? Why did it attain peace? And why does it not accept food?" Thus, the sun, in the form of Rama, rose with many doubts.

**8.** Thus ends the eighty-fourth chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the "Aarya" (authored by the sage Ravi), which describes the peace of the elephant, an ornament of the three worlds.

The Fifty-fifth Chapter

In the meantime, O King, the Kevalis, Desa-bhushan and Kula-bhushan, arrived in Ayodhya along with many other Munis. ||1||

These Desa-bhushan and Kula-bhushan, who had attained the four-faced image on the Vansasthavil mountain, were subjected to an upsarga by their former enemy.  And after being served by the valiant Rama and Lakshmana, they attained the Kevala-jnana, which illuminates all the worlds. ||2-3||

Thereafter, Garuda-indra, who was pleased, gave Rama and Lakshmana various kinds of jewels, weapons, and vehicles, filled with devotion and affection. ||4||

Rama and Lakshmana, who had attained a state of doubt in battle due to being disarmed, conquered their enemies and obtained their kingdom by the grace of these Kevalis. ||5||

These two Munis, Desa-bhushan and Kula-bhushan, who were praised by the Devas and Asuras, and whose fame spread throughout the three worlds, arrived in the city of Ayodhya, the most important of cities. ||6||

They stayed in the forest called Mahendrodya, which was like the Nandana-vana, just as the Munis Sanjay and Nandan had arrived earlier. ||7||

These Kevalis, accompanied by the great assembly of Munis, were radiant like the moon and the sun, and were the bearers of the highest good.  The people of the city became aware of their arrival. ||8||

Thereafter, Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna, eager to pay their respects, were ready to go to the Kevalis. ||9||

When the sun rose, they announced it throughout the city.  Then, mounted on their magnificent elephants, with the three-world-adorning elephant, Jatismaran, leading the way, they set out, with beautiful minds like the Devas, towards the place where the two Kevalis, Desa-bhushan and Kula-bhushan, were seated, like mountains of auspiciousness. ||10-11||

O Shrenik, their mothers, Kaushalya, Sumitra, Kaikeyi, and Supraja (Suprabha), who were devoted to the Jain religion, eager to serve the virtuous, accompanied by hundreds of female attendants, and radiant like celestial nymphs, were also ready to go. ||12-13||

Suग्रीव and other Vidyadharas, filled with the desire to see the Muni, arrived there, accompanied by great splendor. ||14|| Seeing the Muni's umbrella, like the full moon, they dismounted from their elephants, starting from Padma-nabha, and came on foot. ||15|| They folded their hands, praised the Munis, bowed down in reverence, and then sat down on the ground, each in their respective places. ||16|| With focused minds, they listened to the Muni's words, which destroyed the causes of the world and were dedicated to praising Dharma. ||17|| He said, "Anu-dharma and Purna-dharma - Anu-vrat and Maha-vrat - these two are the paths to liberation. Of these, Anu-dharma is the cause of liberation through tradition, while Maha-dharma is said to be the direct cause of liberation." ||18|| The first, Anu-dharma, is extensive and practiced in the household life, while the second, Maha-dharma, is extremely difficult and practiced only by great, heroic, and liberated souls. ||19|| In this world, without beginning or end, beings deluded by greed suffer intense pain in hell and other lower births. ||20|| Dharma is the supreme friend in this world, Dharma is the great benefactor. The root of Dharma is pure compassion, and its fruit cannot be described. ||21|| By associating with Dharma, beings obtain all their desired objects. Dharma is the most revered in the world. Those who are imbued with the spirit of Dharma are called wise in the world. ||22|| The Dharma that is rooted in compassion is the cause of great welfare. That Dharma rooted in compassion does not exist in other, inferior Dharmas of the world; it is different from them. ||23|| That Dharma rooted in compassion, ordained by the Jina, is extremely rare and always present in the path, by which one attains the highest state in the three worlds. ||24|| The supreme fruit of that Dharma is enjoyed by Dharanendra and others in the netherworld, by Chakravarti and others on earth, and by Indra and others in heaven. ||25|| Hearing this, Lakshmana, the virtuous one, bowed his head in reverence and asked the Muni, "O Lord! Why did the elephant king, Triloka-mandana, break the pillar and become agitated, and why did he suddenly become calm again?" ||26-27|| "O Bhagavan! You are worthy of removing my doubts." Then the Kevali, the ornament of the land, spoke as follows. ||28||

He was overwhelmed with extreme agitation due to his great strength, but remembering his past life, he attained peace. ||26|| In the beginning of this age, which is the field of karma, he was born in the city of Ayodhya, taking a body from the womb of Queen Marudevi and bearing the name Uttama. He had bound the karma of a Tirthankara in his previous life, which caused him to be famous for his greatness, like Indra. ||30-31|| He was the lord of the earth, whose lofty breasts were the Vindhya and Hima mountains, and whose girdle was the ocean. He always served the earth, like a devoted wife who always pleases her husband. ||32|| He was Lord Rishabhadeva, who was worshipped by the three worlds. He roamed in the city of Ayodhya, just as Indra roams in heaven. ||33|| He was the glorious Rishabhadeva, adorned with brilliance and radiance. He was endowed with Lakshmi, Sri, and beauty, and was an ocean of auspicious qualities. He possessed the three knowledges, was wise, patient, and profound. His actions were captivating to the eyes and mind. He had a beautiful body, was strong, and was the most powerful. ||34-35|| At the time of his birth, the gods, led by Saudharma Indra, performed his abhisheka with golden and jeweled pots on Mount Sumeru, filled with devotion. ||36|| Who can describe the qualities of Rishabhadeva, whose wealth is constantly desired even by Indra? ||37|| After enjoying the supreme wealth of Lakshmi for a very long time, he saw the apsara Nilanjana and attained enlightenment. ||38|| The gods of the world praised him. The great teacher of the world, Lord Rishabhadeva, who possessed great wealth, left his home after entrusting his kingdom to his hundred sons. ||39|| Since he went to the garden called Tilaka, renouncing all worldly desires, that garden became known as the pilgrimage site of Prajagar in the world. ||40|| He stood like an immovable mountain, like Mount Meru, for a thousand years, renouncing all possessions. He performed severe austerities for a thousand years. ||41|| The four thousand kings who had taken the vow of a monk, due to their devotion to their master, were defeated by the unbearable hardships within six months. ||42||

## The Fifty-Fifth Chapter

Those men of small resolve, who had broken their vows and adopted self-made vows, were like the vallabhis, who, relying on the fruits and roots, adopted the way of the vallabhis. ||43||

Among them, there was a great man, known as Marichi, who, with a mind stained with the passions, adopted the way of the wandering ascetics. ||44||

In the city of Suprabha, there were two sons, Suryoday and Chandroyad, born to the queen Prahladana, who were like great jewels. ||45||

They were renowned throughout the world. They had taken initiation with Lord Adinath, but, corrupted by the monastic path, they were deeply attached to each other and finally sought refuge in Marichi. ||46||

These two disciples of Marichi, who were devoted to the practice of illusory austerities and vows, had many disciples, known as Paribangas. ||47||

Due to their practice of false religion, they wandered through the four realms of existence. The earth was filled with the bodies they had abandoned in their previous births. ||48||

Then, Chandroyad, under the influence of karma, was born in the city of Naga, as the son of King Haripati and Queen Manoluta. He was named Kulankar and became a great king. ||49||

Suryoday was born in the same city, as the son of the learned Brahmin Vishvank and his wife Agni-kunda. He was known as Shrutirat and became the priest of King Kulankar, due to the influence of his past affection, which had grown over many births. ||50-51||

One day, King Kulankar was going to serve the ascetics who had been serving his lineage for generations. On the way, he saw some Digambar Muni-rajas. ||52||

The Muni-rajas were named Abhinandit. They had the eye of omniscience and were benevolent towards all beings. When King Kulankar bowed to them, they said, "O King! Where you are going, your prosperous grandfather, who became an ascetic, has died and become a snake. He is residing in the middle of a piece of wood. An ascetic is splitting that wood. Go and protect him." ||53-54||

When Kulankar went there, everything happened as the Muni-rajas had said. ||55|| 

Page #158:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, 

Seeing those ascetics who had attained the state of non-attachment, King Kalankar was inspired and desired to take the vow of a Shraman (Jain monk). [56]

However, the Purohit (priest) named Shrutirat, who was influenced by the false teachings of Vasu and Parvat, misled him with the statement, "O King! The Vedic Dharma has been passed down through your lineage. Therefore, if you are truly the son of King Haripati, then follow the Vedic Dharma." [57-58]

"O King! For now, follow the Vedic rituals. Later, after establishing your son on the throne, you can pursue the welfare of your soul. O King! Be gracious to me." [59]

King Kalankar agreed, saying, "It is as you say." His beloved queen, Shridhama, who was involved with another man, observed this and thought, "It seems this king has discovered my infidelity and is seeking to renounce the world. Or perhaps he will not renounce the world. Who knows the workings of his mind? I will poison him and kill him." [60-62]

Driven by the sin of contemplating the killing of animals, both the king and the Purohit were reborn as rabbits in a forest called Nikunj. [63]

Then, propelled by the force of karma, they successively took birth as a frog, a rat, a peacock, a serpent, and a deer. [64]

The Purohit was reborn as an elephant, while King Kalankar was reborn as a frog. The elephant crushed the frog to death with its foot. [65]

The frog was reborn in a dry lake and was eaten by crows. He then became a rooster, while the elephant was reborn as a cat. [66]

King Kalankar's soul remained a rooster for three births, and the Purohit, reborn as a cat, ate the rooster. [67]

The king and the Purohit were then reborn as a fish and a crocodile, respectively. They were caught in a net by a fisherman and killed with an axe. [68]

The crocodile was reborn as a...

A creature with two legs is a beast if it is devoid of self-control and virtue. Thus, driven by the desire to learn the Vedas, Raman left his home. [7] Wandering the earth, he studied the four Vedas with their appendages in the houses of teachers. After completing his studies, he returned home. [7]

Longing to see his brother, Raman arrived in the city of Rajagriha as the sun set and darkness enveloped the sky. [72] He stayed outside the city in a dilapidated garden, which was a shrine to the Yakshas. There, this incident unfolded. [73]

Raman's brother, Vinod, who lived in Rajagriha, had a wife named Samidha. This Samidha was a woman of loose morals, and she received a signal from a king named Ashokadatta to meet him at the Yaksha shrine where Raman was staying. [74]

Ashokadatta was apprehended by the police on his way, so he could not reach Samidha as planned. Meanwhile, Vinod, Samidha's true husband, arrived with a sword in hand. [75]

Hearing Raman's kind words to Samidha, Vinod, consumed by anger, killed Raman with his sword. [76]

Afterward, Vinod, the hidden sinner, returned home with his wife, filled with joy. They wandered the world for a long time. [77]

Later, Vinod's soul became a buffalo in the forest, and Raman's soul became a blind bear in the same forest. Both perished in a fire in that Sal forest. [78]

They were then reborn as hunters in the mountain forest, and after death, they became deer. Their parents and other relatives, terrified, scattered in all directions. The two fawns were left alone. Their eyes were exceptionally beautiful, so the hunters captured them alive. [79]

Meanwhile, the third Narayana king, Swayambhu, was on his way to see the immaculate Sri Vimalnath Swami. [80]

The king Swayambhu, adorned with immense wealth, returned after paying homage to the Jina with the gods and demons. He saw the two fawns and, seeing the hunters, he...

He placed them in the Jain temple. || 81 ||
There, seeing the monks and eating food as they wished from the royal court, both deer attained supreme fortitude. || 82 ||
One of the deer, with his lifespan exhausted, attained death through samadhi and went to heaven, while the other wandered among the Nirya. || 83 ||
Then, through karma yoga, the deer named Vinod attained the human state, as if he had received a kingdom in a dream. || 84 ||
In the city of Kampilya, in the Bharat region of Jambudvipa, there lived a wealthy merchant named Dhanada, who had earned twenty-two crore dinars. || 85 ||
The merchant, who was the reincarnation of the deva named Raman, had a virtuous son named Bhushan born to his wife, Varuni. || 86 ||
A fortune-teller told Dhanada that his son would definitely become a monk. Hearing this, Dhanada became anxious about the world. || 87 ||
Driven by love for his son, Dhanada built a house suitable for all activities, where Bhushan resided. || 88 ||
Bhushan, served by excellent women with various clothes, food, and ointments, performed beautiful activities there. || 89 ||
He never saw the rising sun or the setting moon, nor did he ever leave the fifth section of his palace-like mountain. || 90 ||
Dhanada had obtained this only son after hundreds of desires, so he was dearer to him than life itself, due to the influence of past affection. || 91 ||
Dhanada was Bhushan's brother in a previous life, and now he is his father in this life. Indeed, the actions of beings in the world are as strange as the actions of a clown. || 92 ||
Then, one night, as the night ended, Bhushan heard the sound of the divine drum, saw the arrival of the devas, and heard their words, which awakened him. || 93 ||
By nature, he was gentle-hearted, devoted to the practice of the right dharma, filled with great joy, and had his hands clasped together and placed on his head. || 94 ||

This is a hymn in praise of Shri Dhar Muni. He was descending the stairs when he was bitten by a snake and gave up his body. ||15|| He was born in the fourth heaven called Maheindra. From there he fell and was born in the city of Chandra Aditya in the Pushkar island as the son of King Prakash Yash. His mother was Madhavi and he was named Jagad Yuti. When he reached the peak of youth, he attained the highest fortune of the kingdom. ||16-17|| He was very afraid of the world, so the old ministers taught him and with great difficulty made him rule. ||18|| The old ministers said to him, "O son! Protect this beautiful kingdom that has come down from your lineage, because only by protecting the kingdom will all the people be happy." ||19|| He was adorned with the ornaments of the kingdom, and he always kept the ascetics happy by providing them with food and other necessities. Finally, he died and went to the land of enjoyment called Devakuru, and from there he was born in the heaven of Aishan. ||100|| There, he enjoyed many pleasures for many Palyas, surrounded by goddesses and taking on various forms, while possessing supreme radiance. ||101|| From there, he fell to the western Videha region of Jambudvipa, and was born as the son of Queen Ratna, who was as simple as a young female buffalo of the immovable Chakravarti. He was a bearer of great virtues, who brought joy to all beings. He was beautiful in both body and name, that is, he was named 'Abhiram' and was very beautiful in body. ||102-103|| Abhiram was endowed with great dispassion and was eager to take initiation, but the Chakravarti forcibly married him and appointed him to the position of ruler, thus keeping him in the world of wealth. ||104|| Three thousand women constantly nurtured him, a virtuous son, with care, like an elephant in water. ||105|| Surrounded by all those women, Abhiram considered the pleasures of love as poison, and with a peaceful mind, he was eager to take the vows of a monk, but he could not achieve it due to his father's control. ||106|| Sitting amidst all those women, adorned with garlands, bracelets, crowns, and other ornaments, he performed the very difficult vow of Asidhara. ||107|| He, the glorious Abhiram, sat on a fine seat, surrounded by women, and gave teachings that praised the Jain religion. ||108||

Who, desiring jewels, touches the head of a serpent with his hand? Or who is satisfied with the objects of the senses, which are destructive? (111)
Only the attachment to virtue is praiseworthy, leading to the happiness of liberation. The lives of those who are devoid of desire are extremely fickle. (112)
Hearing these words, which preach the ultimate truth, those women became calm and delighted in the rules according to their ability. (113)
Even in his beautiful body, that prince was free from attachment. He used to remove the impurities of karma by fasting from the fourth day onwards. (114)
With a concentrated mind, he used to make his body thin by various austerities, like the summer sun dries up water. (115)
That Sudarshan, with a steady mind, a hero, performed extremely difficult austerities for sixty-four thousand years. (116)
He attained liberation by dying in samadhi, accompanied by the five great vows. He attained the highest divine state in the Brahma-uttar heaven in the kalpa. (117)
Then, the same soul, who was his father Dhanadaseth in the previous birth, wandered through various births and was born in the city of Podanpur, located in the southern part of the Bharat region, in the Jambudvipa. His parents were a Brahmin named Agni-mukha and a Brahmin woman named Shakuma. He was born to them as a son named Mridumati. He was called Mridumati, but he was not soft-minded, but hard-minded. (118-119)
His mind was attached to gambling and disrespect, his path was dusty, and he was hated by people because of his various offenses. He was a bearer of extremely evil deeds. (120)
His parents, distressed by the insults of the people, expelled him from the house. He wandered here and there on earth and again reached Podanpur in his youth.

In the Padma Purana, 
Hearing the words of the goddess, Sri Nandivardhana, the king, became filled with pure understanding.  ||136||
Distressed by the nature of the world, he took refuge in the pure one, the sage Chandramukha, and at his feet, he renounced all attachments and received the Jain initiation. ||137||
He performed severe austerities, following the scriptural injunctions, and with patience, he accepted whatever alms he received. ||138||
On the peak of the mountain, Durggagiri, the sage Gunanidhi, known for his virtues, performed a four-month retreat, renouncing food. ||139||
Praised by gods and demons, the steadfast sage, having completed his vow, flew through the sky, guided by divine will. ||140||
Then, the virtuous Mridumati, seeking alms, arrived in the city of Alok. He had a vision that encompassed all ages. ||141||
The people of the city, including the king, were overjoyed to see him. Recognizing him as the sage who resided on the mountain peak, they showed him great devotion. ||142||
They offered him various kinds of food, seeking to satisfy him. But, blinded by the allure of taste, he succumbed to the illusion of Maya. ||143||
The people said, "You are the same sage who resided on the mountain peak, and the gods worshipped you."  He bowed his head in acknowledgement, but did not deny their words. ||144||
Due to ignorance and pride, he had acquired the seed of suffering, and by indulging in the pleasure of taste, he deceived himself. ||145||
He did not remove the thorn of Maya from his heart before his guru, and thus, he became a recipient of this ultimate suffering. ||146||
Then, Mridumati, after his time, went to the realm of the glorious Abhiraama, a celestial being, where he resided with great splendor. ||147||
Due to the influence of his past actions, he and Abhiraama, both possessing great powers, experienced immense joy in the celestial abode, Trivishtapa. ||148||
Surrounded by celestial beings, they lived in the ocean of bliss, enjoying the fruits of their good deeds. ||149||
Therefore, I take the initiation. You are not worthy of sorrow. ||135||

## The Fifty-Fifth Chapter

Then, that gentle soul, due to the depletion of his store of merit, fell from there and, tainted by the residue of Maya, came to Jambudvipa.  || 150 ||

In Jambudvipa, there is a mountain named Nikunj, adorned with lofty peaks, and on it, a dense forest called Shallki. || 151 ||

In that forest, this elephant, resembling a gathering of clouds, came to be. His roar was like the churning of the ocean, and he had conquered the wind with his speed.  || 152 ||

His form was terrifying in anger, and he was immensely proud. His tusks were as bright as the moon, and he possessed all the qualities of a king of elephants. || 153 ||

He was born in the lineage of great elephants like Vijay, and he was radiant. He seemed to harbor animosity towards Airavata, and he fought at will. || 154 ||

He destroyed lions, tigers, large trees, and even mountains. Even the celestial beings found it difficult to capture him.  || 155 ||

He filled all the wild animals with fear with his mere scent, and he delighted in playing in the mountain groves adorned with various leaves. || 156 ||

He played in the Manas lake, which was unshakable, pure, and adorned with various flowers, along with his followers. || 157 ||

He enjoyed his leisure in the easily accessible Kailasa mountain and in the beautiful hearts of the Mandakini river. He was supremely happy. || 158 ||

This great elephant, who enhanced the prosperity of his kin, also enjoyed playing in the beautiful mountain forests, apart from these places. || 159 ||

He enjoyed the company of thousands of female elephants, who were eager to please him, and he experienced the happiness befitting a leader of the herd. || 160 ||

Surrounded by a multitude of elephants, he roamed here and there, looking as magnificent as Garuda adorned with a flock of birds. || 161 ||

This supreme elephant, whose roar was as deep as the thunder of clouds, and who was like a mountain for the emergence of streams of charity, was seen by Ravana, the king of Lanka. || 162 ||

Ravana, who was fierce in knowledge and prowess, subdued him and made him beautiful with auspicious marks. || 163 ||

Thus, those two gods, who were endowed with happiness and form, continued to play in that heaven, reaching many oceans with their merit. || 146 ||

And then, that gentle soul, due to the depletion of his store of merit, fell from there and, tainted by the residue of Maya, came to Jambudvipa. || 150 || 

Page #166:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
The one who was once in heaven, playing with Apsaras for a long time, enjoying happiness, is now playing with female elephants, enjoying happiness. || 164 ||
Indeed, the power of karma is such that living beings, in various births filled with suffering, attain supreme delight. || 165 ||
The one who was once Abhirama, has now become King Bharata in Ayodhya. This Bharata is very intelligent and his heart is attached to the right Dharma. || 166 ||
His accumulated delusion has been destroyed, and he is averse to worldly pleasures. This Bharata desires to become a monk to end rebirth. || 167 ||
In the time of Lord Rishabhadeva, these two brothers, named Suryodaya and Chandrodaya, were initiated into the Jain Dharma. But later, motivated by pride, they abandoned the Mahavratas and were initiated into the Parivrajaka sect, led by Marichi. As a result, they were afflicted by the suffering of the world, and they wandered in the world for a long time, experiencing the fruits of their karma. || 168 - 169 ||
It is right, because in the world, those who do not perform austerities, inevitably experience the fruits of their actions, which are both pleasurable and painful. || 170 ||
The one who was once Chandrodaya, became a Kulankara, and then a deer that died in meditation. He then became King Bharata, possessing a noble heart. || 171 ||
And the one who was once Suryodaya, a Brahmin, became a deer after death, and then, due to the influence of his past bad karma, he attained the elephant form. || 172 ||
This elephant, possessing immense strength, first uprooted the pillar of bondage and experienced anger. But later, seeing Bharata, he remembered his past life and became calm. || 173 ||
Gautama Swami says, "O wise ones! Knowing this way of coming and going, and the various external pleasures and pains, abandon this forest of karma, which is full of difficulties, and delight in Dharma. Because those who have attained the human form and have not embraced the Dharma taught by the Jinas, are destined to wander in the world,

**Āryagotivṛttaṃ Jinavaravadanavinirgatamupalabhya Śivaikadānatatparamatulām |
Nirjitaraviruci sukṛtaṃ kuruta yato yāta nimalaṃ paramapadam ||175||**

It is said in the Padma Purāṇa, narrated by Ravisena Ācārya, known as Ārṣa, that having obtained the incomparable Jina Dharma, which is revealed from the lotus face of the Jina, and is dedicated to bestowing liberation, perform meritorious deeds that conquer the brilliance of the sun, so that you may attain the pure supreme abode. ||175||

Thus ends the 58th chapter, named **Bharatatribhuvanālaṅkārasamadhyanubhavānukīrtanaṃ**, which describes the previous births of Bharata and Triloka Maṇḍana, the elephant. ||8||

## The Sixty-Fourth Chapter

Hearing those words, so pure and holy, which dispelled the darkness of ignorance, and which described the various sorrows of the ocean of existence, and the past lives of Bharata, the entire assembly became still, like a painted picture. [1-2]

Then, Bharata, with his earrings swaying, renowned for his prowess, majestic and radiant like Indra, arose. Filled with a great surge of emotion, his body humbled, his mind noble, he clasped his hands in a lotus posture. [3-4]

Kneeling on the ground, he bowed to the sage, his heart heavy with the burden of worldly existence. He spoke these beautiful words: [5]

"O Master, I have wandered for ages through thousands of births, each fraught with suffering. Exhausted by the great toil of the path, I beseech you, grant me the cause of liberation." [6]

"O Lord, I have been swept along for eons in the river of existence, tossed by the mighty waves of birth and death. Please, be my handhold, my support." [7]

Having spoken thus, he renounced all his possessions, freed himself from the bonds of the couch, and with great courage, plucked out his hair with his own hand. [8]

Attaining supreme enlightenment and embracing the great vows, Bharata was instantly initiated, becoming a supreme sage. [9]

In the heavens, the gods cried out, "Well done! Well done!" and showered divine flowers upon Bharata, now a sage. [10]

Inspired by Bharata's devotion, over a thousand kings renounced their worldly fortunes and embraced the life of a sage. [11]

Many others, lacking the strength to renounce, bowed to the sage and embraced the householder's life according to the scriptures. [12]

Keki, Bharata's mother, overwhelmed with grief and her mind consumed by sorrow, ran after him, weeping uncontrollably. She collapsed on the ground, overcome by despair. [13]

## The Sixty-Sixth Chapter

**151**

**14.**  Then, overwhelmed by the weight of her son's love, Kekaya lay motionless. Even when sprinkled with sandalwood water from the head of the cow, she did not regain consciousness.

**15.**  After a long time, she regained consciousness and, like a cow separated from her calf, cried out in sorrow.

**16.**  "Oh, my son! You were the joy of my heart, so gentle and full of virtues. Where have you gone? Answer me, and hold me in your arms."

**17.**  "Oh, my son! Abandoned by you, I am drowning in the ocean of sorrow. How can I bear this pain? What have you done?"

**18.**  Hearing her lament, Rama and Lakshmana, the charioteers, comforted her with beautiful words.

**19.**  "Mother, Bharata is virtuous and wise. Abandon your sorrow. Are we not your obedient sons?"

**20.**  Thus, Kekaya, whose fear-induced anxiety was overcome and whose heart was pure, was freed from sorrow by the words of her co-wives.

**21.**  Awakening to her true self, she condemned her own body. "Cursed is this female form, covered in so many flaws! It is utterly impure, repulsive, like the sewage of a city. I will perform actions that will liberate me from the cycle of karma."

**22.**  Kekaya had already been influenced by the teachings of the Jinas. Filled with great dispassion, she donned a white robe.

**23.**  She then received initiation from the Arya named Prithivimati, along with three hundred other women, while upholding the pure Samyaktvam.

**24.**  Abandoning all the entanglements of household life and embracing the supreme Dharma of the Aryikas, Kekaya shone like a spotless moon, free from the association of clouds.

**25.**  At that time, the assembly of the Muni Raja, the ornament of the land, was adorned with a group of Munis possessing great brilliance on one side, and a multitude of Aryikas on the other. The assembly was beautiful, like a lake filled with lotuses.

**1.**  And thus, the noble one, with a peaceful soul, an ornament of the three worlds, was adorned with the Anuvrata by the Muni, according to the prescribed rules.

**2.**  United with right faith, he was a possessor of right knowledge, engaged in right conduct, and complete in the householder's dharma. He was like a wild elephant.

**3.**  He observed fasts for a fortnight or a month, and after the fast, he would perform his Parana with fallen leaves, once a day.

**4.**  This elephant, fearful of the world, devoted to right actions, and full of purity, was worshipped by people and roamed the earth.

**5.**  At the time of Parana, people offered him sweet laddoos, mandakas, and various kinds of puris with great respect.

**6.**  His body and karma were both extremely weakened, bound by the pillar of passion, and controlled by the whip of Yama. This elephant performed intense austerities for four years.

**7.**  Gradually abandoning food, he intensified his austerities. He attained the Brahma-uttar heaven after performing Sallekhana.

**8.**  Adorned with garlands and earrings, surrounded by beautiful women, he enjoyed the pleasures of the gods, due to the influence of his past good deeds.

**9.**  Bharata, too, was a great soul, a great observer of the Mahavratas, a universal being, firm like a mountain, a renunciant of external and internal possessions, free from attachment to the body, a great hero, and a devotee of the four forms of worship. He would sit where the sun sets.

**10.**  He roamed about righteously, engaged in the four forms of worship.

**11.**  He was free from bondage like the wind, fearless like a lion, undisturbed like the ocean, and unshakable like Mount Meru.

**12.**  He was a Digambara, adorned with the armor of truth, armed with the arrows of forgiveness, and always engaged in conquering the enemies of the soul. He was always engaged in the battle of austerities.

**13.**  He was equal to both enemies and friends, equal in happiness and sorrow, equal to grass and jewels. He was a great Shraman, with an equal mind.

## Chapter 78: The Nirvana of Bharata

**154**

The great sage Bharata, adorned with the virtues of a true Jain, traversed the paths of knowledge, guided by the scriptures. He fearlessly walked even through the territories of his enemies. **(14)**

Having completely destroyed the karmic roots of delusion, he attained the supreme knowledge, the light that illuminates both the world and the beyond. **(15)**

The glorious Arya Goti, endowed with such greatness, and having eradicated the karmic dust, attained the desired state of liberation, from which there is no return. **(16)**

Gautama Swami says, "Whoever, with devotion, narrates or listens to this pure and virtuous story of Bharata, will attain longevity, fame, glory, strength, wealth, prosperity, and health." **(17)**

This story is the essence of all narratives, adorned with noble qualities and radiant. O noble ones, listen attentively, for you will soon conquer the brilliance of the sun. **(18)**

Thus ends the seventy-eighth chapter of the Padma Purana, titled "The Nirvana of Bharata," narrated by the revered Ravishena Acharya, known as the Arya. **(8)**

## The Eighty-Eighth Chapter

Great kings, heroes like Bharata, renounced their kingdoms and embraced the path of renunciation, even though they had no desire for their own bodies. ||1||

They attained the rare path, these great souls. I will recount the names of some of them, listen, O king. ||2||

Siddhartha, Siddhasadhyarthi, Ratido, Rativardhana, Ambuvahara, Jambunada, Shalya, Shashankapat, Viraso, Nandano, Nanda, Anand, Sumati, Sudhi, Sadashraya, Mahabuddhi, Suryaro, Janavallabha, Indradhwaja, Shruthadhara, Suchandra, Prithividhara, Alak, Sumati, Krodha, Kundara, Satyavan, Hari, Sumit, Dharmamitraya, Sampurnendu, Prabhakar, Naghusha, Sundana, Shanti, Priyadharma, and others. ||3-6||

These kings were born into pure families, devoted to good conduct, possessed thousands of followers, and their deeds were renowned throughout the world. ||7||

They renounced elephants, horses, foot soldiers, coral, gold, pearls, their harems, and kingdoms, considering them all like withered grass, and embraced the great vows. They were peaceful, possessed various powers, and attained the appropriate stage according to their meditation. ||8-9||

When Bharata, the one who acted like the emperor Bharata, renounced the world, Lakshmana, remembering his virtues, felt empty. ||10||

His mind was filled with sorrow, he was consumed by grief, his voice was choked with sobs, his eyes, like blue lotuses, were dull, and his body leaned against the pillars of the palace. Yet, he, radiant with Lakshmi, spoke softly. ||11-12||

Where is Bharata now, adorned with virtues, who, even in his youth, renounced his attachment to his body? ||13||

How did he, desiring to become a Siddha, embrace the difficult Jain Dharma, abandoning his beloved family and a kingdom like that of the gods? ||14||

Padma Purana
The knower of the rules and regulations, Rama, said that Bharata is supremely blessed and very great. ||15||
Only his intellect is pure, and his birth is meaningful, because he has renounced the kingdom, which is like food mixed with poison, and has attained the state of initiation. ||16||
How can the worthiness of that supreme yogi be described, whose storehouse of virtues even Indra is unable to describe? ||17||
The kings, who had begun to describe the virtues of Bharata, were for a moment, filled with a mixture of the flavors of happiness and sorrow. ||18||
Then, when Rama and Lakshmana, filled with anxiety, stood up, the kings, filled with great wonder, went to their respective places. ||19||
Then, after considering the matter, the kings, whose minds were fixed on their duty, approached Rama, bowed to him, and spoke these words with affection. ||20||
They said, "O Lord! Whether we are learned or ignorant, be pleased with us. You are like the gods in radiance, so grant your consent to the coronation." ||21||
"O best of men! Grant success to our eyes and to our hearts, which are filled with the joy of your coronation." ||22||
Rama said, "Where Lakshmana, the king of kings, who possesses the seven treasures, bows down to my feet every day, what need have I of a kingdom?" ||23||
"Therefore, you should not speak such words against me, for the kingdom is said to be only the fulfillment of one's desires." ||24||
Having said this, they all praised Rama with shouts of victory, and went to Lakshmana, and bowing to him, requested him to accept the coronation. In response, Lakshmana went to Sri Rama. ||25||
Then, at the beginning of the rainy season, drums were beaten, whose sound was like that of the gathering clouds, and whose beginning was marked by the sound of conch shells. ||26||
Dundubhi, dhakka, jhallar, and the best of musical instruments, such as flutes, were playing, and their sounds were mixed with the sound of the conch shell. ||27||
Beautiful auspicious songs and various kinds of dances were performed, which were pleasing to the mind and gave great joy. ||28||

Upon the occasion of this grand festival, Rama and Lakshmana, adorned with supreme glory, ascended the throne for the coronation ceremony. [23] They were crowned with due rituals, using golden and silver urns, adorned with lotuses, and crafted with various precious gems. [30] Both brothers were adorned with crowns, angadas, keyuras, garlands, and earrings. They were also adorned with divine garlands and garments, and were anointed with the finest perfumes. [31] "Victory to Rama, the wielder of the halberd! Victory to Lakshmana, the wielder of the chakra!" Thus, the celestial beings hailed them with shouts of victory. [32] After celebrating this grand festival for the two kings, the celestial kings went to coronate the queen, the daughter of Videha. [33] She, Sita, was already blessed with great fortune, and by this coronation, she became the foremost among all the goddesses. [34] With shouts of joy and victory, they coronated Vaidehi, signifying the glory of the Chakravarti's queen. [35] Vishalya, who had become Lakshmana's consort by giving him life, was also coronated, but her coronation was merely a formality, as she was already his queen. [36] "Victory to Lakshmana, the lord of the three worlds! Victory to you, beautiful one!" Thus, they hailed her with shouts of victory and remained happily. [37]

Rama bestowed the kingdom of Trikuta peak upon Vibhishana, the kingdom of Kishkindha upon Sugriva, the king of the Vanaras, the kingdom of Sriparvata upon Hanuman, the kingdom of Sri Nagar upon the lineage of King Viradhit, and the vast kingdom of Kishkindha, adorned with many wonders and kissed by the waves of the great ocean, upon Nal and Neel. [38-40] He bestowed the kingdom of Rathnapura, a renowned city situated in the south of Vijay mountain, upon the fierce celestial beings who bowed before him. [41] He made Ratnajati the king of Devopagit Nagar, and the rest were made the rulers of their respective territories. [42]

Beautiful songs and various enchanting dances were providing supreme joy. [28]

Thus, the kings who had attained a long-lasting kingdom worthy of their own punya-udaya, and who were filled with joy due to Rama's permission, stood in their respective places, radiant. ||43||

Then, the ever-joyful Rama and Lakshmana said to Shatrughna, "Accept the kingdom that you desire." [1]

"Do you wish to take half of Ayodhya, or the excellent Podanapuram, or the city of Rajagriha, or the beautiful city of Paundrasundara?" [2]

Thus, Rama and Lakshmana suggested hundreds of capitals to the valiant Shatrughna, but none of them found a place in his heart. [3]

Then, when Shatrughna requested Mathura, Rama said to him, "Do you not know that the king of Mathura is Madhu, our enemy?" [4]

"He is the son-in-law of Ravana, adorned with many battles, and the god of the sky, Chandra, has given him a spear that never fails, which is invincible even by the gods, as unbearable as the sun in the summer, and which, after taking thousands of lives, returns to his hand." [5-6]

"For whose sake, we are constantly worried and cannot sleep at night, even for a moment." [7]

"Just as the sun, rising, illuminates the entire world, so too, he, upon his birth, illuminated the vast lineage of the Haris." [8]

"And whose son, Lavanaarnava, is invincible even by the celestial beings, how can you, O valiant one, conquer him?" [9]

Then, Shatrughna said, "What is the use of talking so much? Give me Mathura, and I will take it myself." [10]

"If I do not crush Madhu in battle, like a bee crushing a honeycomb, then I will not be proud of being the son of Dasharatha." [11]

"If I do not pulverize his army, like a Sarabha destroying a group of lions, then I will not be your brother." [12]

"If I do not put that enemy to eternal sleep, then I will not be called a son born from a noble womb, and I will not be protected by your blessings." [13]

Thus, the valiant Shatrughna, the bearer of great brilliance, having obtained the aforementioned vow, ... [14]

Thus, when they were mounted on that excellent steed, the Vidyaadhara lords were filled with utmost wonder. ||14||
Then, to go towards him, Saagara, having moved away Shatrughna, said, "O Dheer, I request you to give me a Dakshina." ||15||
Shatrughna, the vanquisher of darkness, said, "You are the unparalleled, the all-pervading giver. What can be more praiseworthy than your request? What else can be more auspicious for me?" ||16||
"You are the lord even of our lives, what to speak of other things? What can I do for you, except to remove the obstacle of this war?" ||17||
Reflecting, Padmaabha said, "O Vatsa, you should attack Madhu only when he is devoid of the Shula-ratna. Do not attack him at any other time." ||18||
Saying, "As you command," Shatrughna, after paying homage to the Siddhas and taking their blessings, ate food and then, coming to his mother, bowed to her and asked, "Are you well?" ||19||
Seeing her son, the queen, out of affection, smelled his head and said, "O Vatsa, conquer the enemy forces with your sharp arrows." ||20||
Making him sit on the half-seat, the valiant queen, again said, "O Veer, you should not show your back to the enemies in the battle." ||21||
"O son, seeing you victorious and returned from the battle, I will perform the highest worship of the Jinas with golden lotuses." ||22||
"May the Jinas, who are auspicious for the three worlds, who are worshipped by the gods and demons, grant you auspiciousness, being free from attachment." ||23||
"May the Arhants, the Bhagavants, who have conquered the extremely difficult delusion caused by worldly existence, be auspicious for you." ||24||
"May the self-enlightened Jinas, who teach the Dharma of the four paths and the three times, grant you the intellect to conquer your enemies." ||25||
"May the Kevala-jnanis, who see all the worlds and beings like a myrobalan fruit held in the hand, be auspicious for you." ||26||
"May the Siddhas, who are free from karma and form, who reside above the three worlds, who are the givers of Siddhi, be auspicious for you, O Vatsa." ||27||
"May the Aachaaryas, who are like the lotus, the sun, the moon, the Mandara mountain, and the sky, who are the supreme support, be auspicious for you." ||28||
Then, the Vidyaadhara king was filled with utmost wonder. ||14||
Then, to go towards him, Saagara, having moved away Shatrughna, said, "O Dheer, I request you to give me a Dakshina." ||15||
This being heard, Shatrughna said, "You are the unparalleled, the all-pervading giver. What can be more praiseworthy than your request? What else can be more auspicious for me?" ||16||
"You are the lord even of our lives, what to speak of other things? What can I do for you, except to remove the obstacle of this war?" ||17||
Then, Rama, after some reflection, said, "O Vatsa, you should attack Madhu only when he is devoid of the Shula-ratna. Do not attack him at any other time." ||18||
Then, saying, "As you command," Shatrughna, after paying homage to the Siddhas and taking their blessings, ate food and then, coming to his mother, bowed to her and asked, "Are you well?" ||19||

Those who know the governance of the Self and who are followers of the governance of the Self, those ever-living teachers, may they be auspicious for you. ||26|| Those who attain liberation through the twelve-fold austerity, those virtuous, brave ones, may they be auspicious for you. ||30|| Having received this divine auspicious blessing, which removes obstacles, and having bowed to his mother, Shatrughna went out of the house. ||31|| He mounted a great elephant adorned with golden garlands, and he shone like the full moon on the back of a cloud. ||32|| Surrounded by hundreds of kings mounted on various vehicles, he shone like Indra surrounded by gods. ||33|| Having come to meet his brother, who was very dear to him, he said, "O venerable one, return now, I will go ahead without any expectations." ||34|| Lakshmana presented him with the bow-jewel called Samudraavarta and arrows with fiery mouths, swift as the wind. ||35|| Having appointed Krtaantavaktra, who was his equal, as his commander, Rama, filled with anxiety, returned with Lakshmana. ||36|| The valiant hero, Shatrughna, endowed with great strength, went towards Mathura, which was ruled by Madhu. ||37|| Having reached the bank of the holy Punyabhaga river, he halted his army, which had come from a long distance, with some confusion. ||38|| The group of ministers, who had completed all their tasks and whose fatigue had subsided, and whose intellect was very subtle, began to doubt. ||39|| "Oh, look at the mind of this boy, who desires the defeat of Madhu, who is devoid of policy and is driven only by pride." ||40|| "How can this boy conquer Madhu, who was conquered by the mighty Mandhata in battle, who was difficult to conquer even by the celestial beings?" ||41|| "How can he, with his arms, cross the ocean of Madhu, whose advancing foot soldiers are like towering waves?" ||42||
May the Acharya Parameshti, who is as radiant as the sun, as peaceful as the moon, as steady as the earth, as lofty and generous as Sumeru, as deep as the ocean, and as detached as the sky, and who is the ultimate foundation, be auspicious for you. ||2|| May the Acharya Parameshti, who knows the governance of the Self and the other, and who always teaches his followers, be auspicious for you, O long-lived one. ||26|| And may the virtuous, brave Sadhu Parameshti, who attain liberation through the twelve-fold austerity, be auspicious for you, O Bhadra. ||30||

In the Padma Purana,
"Who can enter the forest of Madhu, which is filled with large trees and fierce, intoxicated elephants, and emerge alive?" (43)
Hearing this, the commander of the army, with a face like death, said, "Why are you all so afraid? Why have you abandoned your pride?" (44)
"Even though Madhu is arrogant because of his invincible spear, he is still capable of being killed by the handsome Shatrughna." (45)
"A strong elephant, even though it can uproot trees with its trunk, is still killed by a lion." (46)
"Shatrughna is endowed with Lakshmi and prowess, he is patient, strong, intelligent, and has excellent allies, so he will surely destroy the enemy." (47)
Then, the spies, following the orders of the ministers, went to the city of Mathura. Upon their return, they reported the news as follows:
"Listen, O gods! There is a city called Mathura in the eastern direction. Outside the city, there is a very beautiful garden surrounded by the royal quarters." (48-49)
"Just as the garden of Kubera, called Kubera-chchanda, is situated in the middle of the divine forest, and is filled with the fulfillment of desires, so too is this garden." (50)
"King Madhu resides in this garden with his queen, Jayanti. Just as an elephant is subdued by a female elephant, so too is Madhu subdued by his queen." (51)
"He is very lustful, he has abandoned all other duties, he is very proud, and he is under the influence of delusion. Today is the sixth day since he has been staying in the garden." (52)
"Madhu, whose mind is under the control of lust, does not know of your vow, nor does he know of your arrival. Just as a physician neglects a patient, so too have the wise neglected him because of the strength of his delusion." (53)
"If we do not conquer Mathura now, then the ocean of Madhu will become unbearable due to the flow of rivers, which are the armies of other men. It will be difficult to conquer him." (54)
Hearing these words, Shatrughna, who was skilled in strategy, set out for Mathura with an army of one hundred thousand horses. (55)

## The Most Auspicious Festival
### 163

While everyone was lost in slumber at midnight, the glorious Shatrughna, having attained great prosperity, returned and entered the gates of Mathura. ||56||

Shatrughna was like a yogi, the gates were like a heap of dust, and Mathura was like a land of attainment, beautiful and delightful. ||57||

"Victory to Shatrughna, the son of Dasharatha!" A great roar arose from the mouths of the people, praising him. ||58||

Just as the people of Lanka were filled with fear and anxiety when Angada arrived, so too were the people of Mathura filled with fear and anxiety when they learned of the city's invasion by the enemy. ||59||

The women, their eyes trembling with fear and their hearts filled with anxiety, felt their unborn children stir within them. ||60||

Awakened by the loud clamor, the brave warriors, fearless like lions, rose up instantly. ||61||

Shatrughna, with his immense strength, destroyed the enemy forces with a mere sound, and entered the home of King Madhu. ||62||

There, he stood, protected by his divine weapons, guarding the armory. He was pleased and had achieved his rightful success. ||63||

With his sweet and charming words, he comforted everyone, and they all abandoned their fear. ||64||

Knowing that Shatrughna had entered Mathura, Madhusundara, with his great strength, emerged from his garden, filled with rage like Ravana. ||65||

Just as a soul protected by a sage cannot be touched by delusion, so too could King Madhu not enter the place protected by Shatrughna. ||66||

Though Madhu tried various ways to enter Mathura, he was unable to do so. He was without a weapon, but despite his pride, he did not seek peace with Shatrughna. ||67||

Unable to bear the sight of the enemy's arrogant army, Shatrughna's cavalrymen rode out from their ranks. ||68||

As the battle began, Shatrughna's entire army arrived, and the two armies, like vast oceans, clashed. ||69||

Chariots, elephants, and foot soldiers, all equipped with various weapons, clashed with each other, their speed and power unmatched. ||70||

Padma Purana
The army of Asahanparasainya could not bear the pride of the fierce and mighty sound. The wicked Krtaanta, with his swift and powerful army, rushed into the battle. ||7||
He played in the battle, his speed unchecked, like Indra in the garden of the self-born. ||72||
Then, seeing him, the prince Lavanaarnava, like a cloud, covered him with arrows. ||73||
He, in turn, with arrows like serpents, drawn to his ears, cut off his arrows, filling the earth and sky with them. ||74||
They, fierce in strength, like lions, tore at each other, mounted on the backs of elephants, filled with anger, they fought. ||75||
Krtaanta, struck first in the chest, made his armor a shield against the arrows of the enemy. ||76||
Then, raising his spear, Lavanaarnava, with eyes blazing with anger, struck Krtaanta in the face. ||77||
Both, drenched in their own blood, fierce and engaged in a great battle, shone like two blooming Palasha trees. ||78||
There was a terrible clash of maces, swords, and discs between them, fueled by their mutual madness and desire to conquer. ||79||
Lavanaarnava, struck by a Shakti, fought for a long time, but fell to the ground, his chest pierced, his heavenly merit exhausted. ||80||
Seeing his son fall, Madhu, with a sweet cry, ran towards Krtaanta, but was stopped by Shatrughna, who roared at him. ||81||
Madhu, overwhelmed by unbearable grief and anger, was stopped by the mountain-like Shatrughna, and grew in proximity. ||82||
Unable to see his sight, like that of a venomous serpent, Shatrughna's army fled, like a swarm of dry leaves scattered by a strong wind. ||83||
Seeing him approaching, the warriors, filled with pride, returned to face Shatrughna. ||84||
The horsemen and foot soldiers, the swift chariots, the elephants, and the horsemen and foot soldiers clashed together. ||70||
Krtaanta, unable to bear the pride of the fierce sound of the enemy army, rushed into the enemy ranks with great speed. ||71||
He played in the battle, his speed unchecked, like Indra in the garden of the self-born. ||72||
Then, seeing him, the prince Lavanaarnava, like a cloud, covered him with arrows. ||73||
He, in turn, with arrows like serpents, drawn to his ears, cut off his arrows, filling the earth and sky with them. ||74||

1. Shatrughna.

## The Most Auspicious Festival

Those who follow, filled with fear, are defeated only until they see their lord, with a smiling face, in front of them. ||85||

Then, mounted on an excellent chariot, wielding a divine bow, his chest adorned with a garland, his crown and earrings swaying, shining like the autumn sun, unstoppable in his movement, the lord, filled with extreme anger, faced the enemy. ||86-87||

Just as a fire consumes a pile of dry leaves in an instant, so too did the destroyer of enemies, Shatrughna, burn hundreds of warriors in a moment. ||88||

No warrior could stand against him in battle, just as no one tainted by other doctrines can stand before a learned man of the Jain faith. ||89||

Any human who wished to fight him met the same fate as an elephant facing a lion, destroyed in an instant. ||60||

Their army, like the insane, was utterly distraught, falling, heavily wounded, seeking refuge in Madhu. ||61||

As Shatrughna advanced, Madhu cut his banner, and Shatrughna, in turn, pierced his chariots and horses with arrows sharp as razors. ||62||

Then, Madhu, his mind filled with confusion, his body burning with anger, mounted a huge elephant, like a mountain. ||63||

Like a great cloud covering the sun, Madhu aimed to cover Shatrughna with a continuous barrage of arrows. ||64||

The clever Shatrughna, in turn, pierced his arrows and armor, welcoming him to the battle with a generous offering of arrows, as is the custom. ||65||

Then, Madhu, realizing he was armed only with a spear, and burdened by the great sorrow of his son's death, saw his enemy as invincible and thought, "My end is near." ||66||

Remembering his past deeds, his wisdom, his non-violence, his words, his patience, he realized that his karma was exhausted. ||67|| 

Page #184:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, at the beginning of this impermanent and sorrowful existence, what single act is praiseworthy in this world? It is the act that leads to Dharma. (18)

A virtuous soul, having obtained human birth, who does not apply their mind to Dharma, is truly cheated by the karma of delusion. (6)

Knowing that rebirth is certain, I, a sinner, did not act in my own best interest when time was in my control. Alas, I am a fool, a careless one. (100)

Why did I not develop wisdom when I was in control of my own actions? Now that the enemy is before me, what can I do, a wretched soul? (101)

What is the use of digging a well when the house is on fire? And what is the time for chanting mantras when one has been bitten by a snake? These actions should have been done beforehand. (102)

In this situation, it seems right to me to calm my mind and seek a good resolution, for that is the cause of self-benefit. (103)

Salutations to the Arhats, the liberated ones, the Acharyas, the Upadhyayas, and the Sadhus, these five supreme beings. (104)

The Arhats, the liberated ones, the Sadhus, and the Kevalis, along with Dharma, are the four auspicious things that are always beneficial to me. (105)

In the three and a half islands, in the fifteen realms of karma, I bow down to all the Arhats, the lords of the world, with my mind, speech, and body. (106)

As long as I live, I will abandon the external yoga, but not the pure soul. I condemn the past karma I have accumulated and am dedicated to renunciation. (107)

In this endless forest of existence, the sins I have committed are false. I am now absorbed in contemplating the truth. (108)

I abandon all that is to be abandoned and accept all that is to be accepted. Knowledge and vision are my soul, while the rest are merely characteristics of association with objects. (109)

For the sake of liberation, neither grass nor the best land is a support, but only the soul free from contaminated mind is the true support. (110)

Thus, having ascended to the proper meditation, he abandoned both internal and external attachments. (111)

The karma that caused his birth was exhausted, and with great patience and remorse, he remembered the words of the Digambara monks. (66-67)

He began to think that this entire beginning is fleeting and brings only sorrow. In this world, the only act worthy of praise is the one that leads to Dharma. (68)

## The Eighty-Ninth Chapter

**The Most Auspicious Festival**

Even though his body was riddled with deep wounds, he held firm to his unwavering fortitude. He had renounced attachment to his body and all its possessions, and his mind was now perfectly pure. || 112 ||

Upon seeing this, Shatrughna approached him and offered his salutations, saying, "O virtuous one, please forgive this sinner." || 113 ||

The celestial nymphs, who had come to witness the battle, were filled with wonder and showered him with flowers, their hearts overflowing with pure emotions. || 114 ||

**The Story of the Lineage**

Then, entering into Samadhi, Madhu, in the blink of an eye, merged his consciousness into the ocean of supreme bliss, becoming the exalted celestial being, Sanatkumara. || 115 ||

The valiant Shatrughna, having fulfilled his purpose, entered Mathura with great joy. He resided there, just as Megheshvara-Jayakumar had resided in Hastinapur. || 116 ||

Gautama Swami said, "O King! Those who attain Samadhi and take birth in the world, acquire a divine form. Therefore, O noble ones, always engage in virtuous deeds, so that you may attain a radiance surpassing even that of the sun." || 117 ||

Thus ends the eighty-ninth chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the "Madhusundara Vada," narrated by the sage Ravishena. || 86 ||

## The Latest Chapter

The divine, infallible, jewel-like spear, though potent, was rendered ineffective by the power of the enemy. Its brilliance was extinguished, and it deviated from its ordained path. (1)

Carrying sorrow, grief, and shame, like a bird released from its cage, he went to his master, the lord of the Asuras, Chamarendra. (2)

Upon hearing the news of Madhu's demise from the spear, Chamarendra, whose heart was filled with memories of their friendship, was overwhelmed with sorrow and grief. (3)

Rising from the netherworld with great speed and brilliance, fueled by rage, he set out for Mathura. (4)

While roaming, the king of the Garuda, Venudhari, saw Chamarendra and asked, "O king of the Daityas, where are you headed?" (5)

Chamarendra replied, "I am determined to avenge the injustice done to my dear friend, Madhu, by the one who killed him." (6)

The king of the Garuda said, "Have you never heard of the greatness of Vishalya, which you seem to disregard?" (7)

Chamarendra responded, "Those times of wonder have passed, when Vishalya possessed such unimaginable power." (8)

"When she was bound by the vow of her youth, she was indeed a wonder. Now, through her union with Narayana, she is like a serpent devoid of venom." (9)

"The virtues of those who follow a righteous path, who are wise and free from all transgressions, are born from their past good deeds and are worthy of praise." (10)

"Vishalya, with her immense pride, triumphed only until she saw the face of Narayana, who embodies desire." (11)

"The gods, demons, and ghosts fear those who follow their vows, until they abandon their sharp sword of determination." (12)

**Padma Purana**

Shtrughna Kumar, though endowed with the heart of a protector of Mathurapuri, was deeply attached to it. Just as Rama could not find solace without Vaidehi, so too, Shtrughna could not find solace without Mathura. ||28||

The union of beautiful things with beings is like a dream, fleeting and ephemeral. It generates a sorrow far greater than the scorching heat of the summer sun. ||2||

Thus ends the ninetieth chapter of the Padma Purana, titled "Mathura Upa-sarga," narrated by the sage Ravishena. ||10||

She was beautiful, skilled in fulfilling all desires like the wish-fulfilling cow, and adorned with heavenly pleasures. Yet, the heart of Shtrughna Kumar remained deeply attached to Mathura. Just as Rama could not find solace without Sita, so too, Shtrughna could not find solace without Mathura. ||27-28||

Gautama Swami said, "O Shrenika! When beings experience the union of beautiful things, it is like a dream, fleeting and ephemeral. It generates a sorrow far greater than the scorching heat of the summer sun." ||26||

Thus ends the ninetieth chapter of the Padma Purana, titled "Mathura Upa-sarga," narrated by the sage Ravishena. ||10||

The 19th Chapter

Then the king of Rajagriha, filled with wonder, asked Gautama Swami, "O Bhagavan, for what reason did Shatrughna desire that very Mathura?" ||1||

"There are many other capitals, resembling the heavens. Why is it that the valiant Shatrughna had such affection only for Mathura?" ||2||

Then Gautama Ganadhara, like the moon amidst the ocean of divine knowledge and the constellation of Ganadharas, said, "I will tell you the reason for Shatrughna's affection for Mathura. Keep it in your mind." ||3||

"For he had many births in that very Mathura. Therefore, he had great affection for it." ||4||

"A being, who is a devotee of the ocean of Samsara, due to his karmic nature, was born in the Mathura city of the Bharat Kshetra of Jambudvipa as Yamunadeva. He was cruel by nature and completely averse to Dharma. After death, he became a pig, then a donkey, and then a crow." ||5-6||

"Then he became a goat, and then, after being burnt in a fire, he became a buffalo with long horns. This buffalo was used for carrying water." ||7||

"This being of Yamunadeva became a buffalo six times, suffering various miseries, and five times he was born as a poor man in low families." ||8||

"It is right, for those beings who follow the middle path, become Aryas and humans, and experience some reduction in their karma." ||9||

"Then he was born as a Brahmin named Kulandhara, who was devoted to the service of the virtuous. He was handsome, but devoid of the practice of good conduct." ||10||

"One day, the king of that city, with the hope of victory, went to another country without any fear. His queen, named Lalita, was alone in the palace. One day, she was looking out of the window when she saw that wicked Brahmin making gestures." ||11-12||

"Seeing Kulandhara, the Brahmin, playing, the queen was struck by the arrows of love. She had him brought to a secluded place by a trusted maid." ||13||

"When he entered the palace, the king, who was unaware of his arrival, saw his actions by chance." ||14||

## Chapter 172 of the Padma Purana

172
Padma Purana

While seated on an asana with the queen, the king suddenly arrived and witnessed his actions. ||14|| Although the queen, skilled in deception, cried out loudly, "This is a captive," the king did not believe her, and the warriors seized the frightened Brahmin. ||15||  

Thereafter, to inflict punishment on all eight limbs, the Kulandhara Brahmin was taken outside the city. There, a virtuous sage named Kalyana, whom he had served many times, saw him and said, "If you take initiation, I will save you." Kulandhara accepted initiation, and the sage rescued him from the wicked men of the king. Upon being rescued, he became a Shraman sage. ||16-17||

Subsequently, with great devotion, he performed extremely arduous austerities and became the lord of the Ritu-Vimana of the Saudharma heaven. Indeed, what is difficult for Dharma? ||18||

Then, in Mathura, there was a generous king named Chandrabhad. His wife's name was Dhura, and she had three brothers: Suryadeva, Sagaradeva, and Yamunadeva. Besides these brothers, he had eight sons: Shrimukh, Sanmukh, Sumukh, Indramukh, Prabhamukh, Ugramukh, Arkamukh, and Aparamukha. ||16-20||

Chandrabhad's second wife, who was unique and unparalleled even though she was the second, was named Kanakaprabha. When the soul of Kulandhara Brahmin fell from the Ritu-Vimana, he was born to her as a son named Achal. ||21||

Achal was rich in arts and virtues, captivating the minds of all people, and he was always eager to engage in appropriate play. Therefore, he shone like a divine prince. ||22||

Then, a man named Anga, after approving of Dharma, had a son named Apa in the city of Shravasti, from a woman named Angika, the wife of a man named Kampa. ||23||

Kampa was a carpenter, making doors for a living, and his son was extremely disrespectful. Therefore, he expelled him from the house. As a result, Apa wandered here and there, filled with fear and sorrow. ||24||

Thereafter, the aforementioned Achal Kumar was dearly loved by his father. Therefore, his stepmother Dhura's three brothers and the eight sons named Mukhanta were envious of him and secretly desired to kill him. Achal's mother, Kanakaprabha, learned of their envy. ||25||

Being desired secretly, he fled, knowing that his mother was aware of their intentions. In the Tilaka forest, he was struck by a large thorn. ||26||

The One Hundred and Ninth Chapter

Bearing a load of wood, Ap saw him.  He was standing still, unable to move, groaning in pain. ||27||
Leaving his load of wood, Ap approached him and removed the thorn with his knife.  He said, "If you ever hear of a famous Achal, you should go to him without any doubt." ||28||
Ap went on his way, and the prince Achal, though sorrowful, was resolute and reached the outskirts of Kaushambi. ||30||
There, in Kaushambi, the son of King Koshavatsa, Indradatta, was practicing archery.  Hearing the sound of the bow, Achal went to him. ||31||
Achal had defeated Indradatta's archery teacher, Vishikacharya.  When King Koshavatsa learned of this, he honored Achal greatly, welcomed him into the city, and gave him his daughter, Indradatta, in marriage. ||32||
Gradually, through his influence and past good deeds, he became known as Upadhyaya and then as a king. ||33||
After conquering Anga and other territories, he came to Mathura, where he set up camp outside the city with his army. ||34||
The king Chandrabhadga, spreading the word that Achal was a "murderer of his son," turned all his vassals against him. ||35||
Chandrabhadga was left alone.  Overwhelmed with sorrow, he sent his three brothers-in-law, Suryadeva, Abhideva, and Yamunadeva, to negotiate peace. ||36||
Seeing Achal and recognizing him, they were ashamed and afraid.  They fled, abandoning their servants and the eight sons of the queen of the earth. ||37||
Achal, reunited with his mother, celebrated greatly.  He gained a kingdom where all kings bowed down and which was honored for its virtues. ||38||

Padma Purana
Once, a performer of the Natarang came to the city. Seeing him being beaten by the guards, the king recognized him. || 36 || Calling him to him, the king gave him the name Aparang and gave him the city of Sravasti as his birthplace. || 40 || These two friends lived together. One day, they went to the garden to play, and there they saw the Acharya named Yasho Samudra. Seeing him, they both attained the state of Nirgrantha. || 41 || Filled with the feeling of Samyag Darshan, both the monks attained the highest restraint and at the end of their lives, they died in Samadhi and became Devas in the heaven of Kamalottara. || 42 || Then, that same Achal, due to the remaining merit, descended from heaven and became the king Shatrughna, who brought joy to the eyes of his mother, Suprija. || 43 || Gautama Swami says, "O King! Due to the connection of many births, he has a great affection for Mathura." || 44 || If one takes shelter in the shade of a house or a tree, or even stays there for a day, one develops affection for it. || 45 || What to say of the place where one has lived for many births? This is the way of those who wander in the cycle of birth and death. || 46 || Aparang's soul, due to the remaining merit, became the famous and powerful commander of the army, known as Kritanta Vaktra. || 47 || Thus, these two attained the highest wealth due to the effect of Dharma Arjana. It is true that those who are devoid of Dharma cannot attain anything that brings happiness. || 48 || This creature has accumulated sins in many births, so he should attain purity in the Dharma-tirtha, which destroys the dirt of suffering. Taking refuge in the Jal-tirtha is useless. || 49 || Thus, this wonderful and excellent story of Shatrughna, which has come down from the tradition of the Acharyas, should be known by the wise, so that they may always be devoted to Dharma. || 50 ||

## The 29th Chapter

Seven Nirgrantha Munis, radiant like the sun, traveled and arrived in Mathurapuri. They were: 

1.  Surmanyu
2.  Shrimanyu
3.  Shrinichaya
4.  Sarvasundara
5.  Jayavan
6.  Vinayalalas
7.  Jayamitra

All of them were known for their impeccable character. They were the sons of Queen Dharani, wife of King Shrinandan, and were renowned throughout the world for their pure qualities. They resided in Prabhapura. 

These seven Munis, upon witnessing the arrival of the Devas during the time of Preetikara Muni's Kevalgyan, were awakened and prepared to engage in Dharma with their father. 

King Shrinandan, the valiant leader, entrusted his kingdom to a one-month-old child named Damar Mangal and, along with his sons, took initiation from Preetikara Muni. 

In due time, King Shrinandan attained Kevalgyan and entered the Siddhalaya. His sons, becoming great Munis, were known as the Seven Rishis. 

During the rainy season, when the land was covered with clusters of tubers, these Munis resided under a banyan tree near Mathurapuri, practicing their Yoga. 

The power of their penance destroyed the epidemic created by Chamarendra, just as a woman who has been seen by her father-in-law is destroyed. 

The fertile lands of Mathura, drenched by heavy clouds, were abundant with crops that grew without being sown or cultivated. 

Free from disease and pestilence, the auspicious city of Mathura shone brightly, like a new bride, pleased by the sight of her father. 

These seven Rishis practiced intense austerities, including various forms of Rasa Tyaga (renunciation of taste), Vela Tela (fasting), and other forms of fasting. 

They traversed vast distances, covering the sky in the blink of an eye, and performed their Parana (breaking of fast) in distant cities like Vijayapura and Podanapura.

The excellent Muni-Rajas, having received alms in their hand-held bowls from other houses, consumed them only for the sustenance of their bodies. ||14||

On one day, when the sun was in the middle of the sky, those great, peaceful Muni-Rajas, looking at the measure of the earth, entered the city of Ayodhya. ||15||

With the intention of receiving pure alms, and with their long arms hanging down, those Muni-Rajas, following the proper procedure, reached the house of the Arha-Hatta Seth. ||16||

Seeing those Muni-Rajas, the Arha-Hatta Seth, without any confusion, started thinking: "Where is this rainy season, and where is this conduct of the Muni-Rajas?" ||17||

In the caves of the Prag-Bhar mountain, on the banks of the river, at the roots of trees, in empty houses, in the Jinalaya, and in other places, wherever the Muni-Rajas are situated, those Muni-Rajas, who possess excellent conduct, do not wander around without completing the year-long vow, thus negating the time. ||18-19||

But these Muni-Rajas are contradicting the meaning of the Agamas, they are devoid of knowledge, they are without teachers, and they are corrupt in their conduct. Therefore, they are wandering around here at this time. ||20||

Although those Muni-Rajas had arrived at an inappropriate time, the daughter-in-law of the Arha-Hatta Seth, who was devoted and receptive to their intentions, satisfied them by offering them food. ||21||

After taking food, they went to the temple of the Arhant Bhagavan, which was filled with Muni-Rajas of pure and virtuous conduct, where the image of Sri Muni-Suvrat Bhagavan, who brings joy to the three worlds, was enshrined. ||22||

Then, the Sri Dhuti-Bhattaraka, who was present in the temple, saw those excellent Muni-Rajas, who were walking four angulas above the earth, possessing supernatural powers. ||23||

Those Muni-Rajas, with great faith, entered the Jinalaya on foot, and the Dhuti-Bhattaraka, standing up, worshipped them according to the proper procedure, including bowing down. ||24||

Knowing that "our Acharya is eager to worship whoever he wants," the disciples of the Dhuti-Bhattaraka thought of criticizing those seven Rishis. ||25||

After that, those seven Rishis, who were devoted to proper praise, worshipped the Jinendra Bhagavan, and then flew back to their own place through the sky. ||26||

Knowing that those Muni-Rajas were Charana-Shramanas, the other Muni-Rajas, who were disciples of the Dhuti-Bhattaraka, became filled with good thoughts, thinking about their own criticism. ||27||

They were performing the Parana. ||13||

## The 29th Chapter

There, the one who had attained the highest state of right faith, was eager to perform the worship of the monks with full effort, after having established the right faith. ||42|| The hermitage, adorned with drinking water facilities, playhouses, music halls, and other amenities, became as beautiful as a heavenly abode. ||43|| Hearing this news, Shatrughna, the fourth son of King Dasharatha, mounted his mighty steed and went to the presence of the seven sages. ||44|| Filled with utmost devotion to the monks and overflowing with love for her son, his mother, Suprija, also went there with her treasury. ||45|| Then, with a devout heart and joy, Shatrughna bowed to the monks who had completed their vows and requested them to break their fast. ||46|| The chief monk said, "O noble king! Monks do not partake of food that is prepared for them with a specific intention." ||47|| "The penance of a yogi is nourished by the food that is not self-obtained, not obtained through others, and not approved of by the mind. It is obtained according to the rules." ||48|| Then Shatrughna said, "O great monks! You are kind to those who seek your blessings. Therefore, you should be pleased to stay in my city for some time." ||49|| "By your presence, this city will be prosperous in all ways, just as a lotus blooms in all directions after the rain has ceased." ||50|| "This city will be filled with happiness and abundance for the people living here." ||51|| Saying this, Shatrughna, filled with faith, pondered, "When will I be able to offer the desired food to the monks, free from any flaws, according to the rules?" ||52|| Then, seeing Shatrughna with his head bowed, the great monk, Gautam Swami, explained to him the influence of time. ||53|| He said, "When the time of the Tirthankaras passes in sequence, there will be a terrible time here, devoid of righteousness and good deeds." ||54|| "This highly elevated Jain religion will be obscured by wicked hypocrites, just as the sun's disc is obscured by dust particles." ||55|| 

Page #198:

In the Padma Purana,
Villages will be like cremation grounds, cities like the realm of the dead, and countries will be filled with misery, scorned and wicked. ||56||
This world will be constantly overrun by cruel, wicked heretics, engaged in evil deeds like thieves. ||57||
The earth will be filled with wicked people and impoverished householders, and thousands of sorrows related to violence will constantly be experienced here. ||58||
Sons will be devoid of affection for their parents, and parents for their sons, and in the Kali Yuga, kings will be like thieves, stealing wealth. ||59||
Even though some people will be happy, they will have evil in their hearts and will play with each other through stories that lead to misery, thus deceiving each other. ||60||
O Shatrughna! When the time of abundant passions arrives, all extraordinary things like the attainment of heaven will be destroyed. ||61||
People, filled with great delusion, will be disgusted upon seeing the virtuous ones, those who wear the form of the liberated, adorned with vows and qualities. ||62||
Thinking the inappropriate to be appropriate, many wicked people will fall into the clutches of fear, like moths falling into fire. ||63||
Many foolish people, eager to laugh, will scorn the peaceful-hearted virtuous ones and will diligently provide food for the foolish. ||64||
Thus, rejecting the virtuous ones, they will approach the deceitful ones, and with evil intentions, they will give food to the deceitful ones. ||65||
Just as a seed placed on a stone, even if watered constantly, is useless and does not bear fruit, so too is the charity of householders to those without virtue. ||66||
The householder who, disregarding the monks, gives food to another householder, is like a fool who abandons sandalwood and takes a bitter fruit. ||67||
Knowing this, the time of wickedness and evil has arrived, do something good and permanent for your own benefit. ||68||
You are a man of name, therefore, resolve to give alms to the homeless monks. This is the essence of your wealth. ||69||
O King! In the future, giving alms to the weary monks will be a great refuge, equal to giving your own home. ||70||

## The 29th Chapter

Therefore, O son, give this donation and now embrace the vows of a householder. Make your life meaningful. || 71 || May the people of Mathura be devoted to the right path, filled with compassion and affection, and imbued with the spirit of the Jina's teachings. || 72 || Let Jina images be established in every home, worshipped, and adorned with abhisheka. Let the people be protected according to the rules. || 73 || O Shatrughna, diligently establish images of the Seven Sages in the four directions of the city. By doing so, there will be peace. || 74 || From today onwards, in any house where there is no Jina image, the Mari will devour it just as a tigress devours an orphaned deer. || 75 || In the house where even a thumb-sized image of the Jina is present, the Mari will not enter, just as a serpent is afraid of Garuda. || 76 || 

Having said, "As you command," Shatrughna, filled with joy, the virtuous ones, desiring the good, ascended into the sky. || 77 || Then, after circumambulating the Nirvana realms, the monks descended into Janaki's house, seeking auspiciousness. || 78 || Sita, filled with great joy and adorned with virtues like faith, offered them a parana with the best food, according to the rules. || 79 || Having eaten the food offered by Janaki with devotion, filled with all virtues, the monks gave their blessings and departed. || 80 || 

Then, Shatrughna established images of the Jina, unparalleled in their beauty, both inside and outside the city. || 81 || He also established images of the Seven Sages, with beautiful features, made of wood, in the four directions, to ward off all evils. || 82 || He established a new city, which seemed as if it were created on top of heaven. It was beautiful from all sides, vast, free from all troubles, three yojanas in extent, three times as large on all sides, vast, circular in shape, and possessed of excellent radiance. || 83-84 || The earth there was beautiful, with roots that extended to the netherworld, and it was like a large, beautiful house. || 85 ||

In the Padma Purana,
The gardens were adorned with an abundance of flowers and fruits. The ponds were covered with lotuses and lilies, and resounded with the songs of birds. ||86||
The palaces, resembling the peaks of Kailasa, were adorned with beautiful features and were as radiant as the eyes. ||87||
All the inhabitants were wealthy with gold, grains, and jewels, and were comparable to the Sammed Shikhar. They were renowned like kings and highly praiseworthy. ||88||
The kings were endowed with unparalleled wealth, like the gods. They were always devoted to dharma, artha, and kama, and were skilled in performing virtuous deeds. ||89||
Shatrughna, a wise man, ruled over the city of Mathura, fulfilling the wishes of the kings, just as Varuna rules over the gods. ||90||

Arya Giti Chhandah
Gautama Swami says that whoever hears or narrates the story of the seven sages residing in Mathura and their miraculous influence, will soon attain all four types of auspiciousness. ||61||
Those who are always devoted to the company of the virtuous, attain all their desires. Therefore, O virtuous ones! Embrace the company of the virtuous and shine like the sun. ||62||
Thus ends the 62nd chapter of the Padma Purana, narrated by Acharya Ravishena, titled "Mathurapuri Nivesha Rishi Dana Guna Upa Sarga Hanana", which describes the residence of the seven sages in Mathura, their gifts, virtues, and the destruction of evil influences. ||62||

## The Thirty-Ninth Chapter

And in the south of the Vijay mountain, there is a city called Ratnapura. There, the king of the Vidyadharas, Ratnaratha, rules. ||3|| He has a beautiful daughter named Manorama, born from the womb of his queen, who is known as Purnacandranana. ||2|| Seeing his daughter's blossoming youth, the wise king became deeply concerned about finding a suitable husband for her. ||3|| He discussed this matter with his ministers, pondering, "To whom should we give this princess?" ||4|| As days passed and the king remained troubled, Narada arrived and was received with honor. ||5|| Knowing the desires of all beings, the king, seated comfortably, spoke to Narada. ||6|| "O Narada, do you not know Langala Lakshmana, the brother of the great man of this age, Sri Rama?" ||7|| "He possesses the greatest Lakshmi, is adorned with beautiful qualities, and has subdued all his enemies through the power of his chakra." ||8|| "This princess, like the moonlight to the lotus, is a source of joy to the heart, and she is a perfect match for him." ||9|| As Narada spoke these words, the sons of Ratnaratha, filled with pride, anger, and a desire for revenge, became enraged. ||10|| Remembering the deep hatred born from the killing of their kin, they flared up like flames of a funeral pyre, their bodies trembling with fury. ||11|| "We must kill that wicked man immediately, and we will not give him our sister!" ||12||  Driven by the anger of the princes, the servants tried to seize Narada, but he quickly ascended into the sky and flew to Ayodhya, where he respectfully approached Lakshmana. ||13-14|| First, Narada recounted the affairs of the world to Lakshmana in detail, and then... 

Page #202:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, a captivating picture of the maiden was depicted, captivating the mind and heart. It seemed as if the beauty of the three worlds was combined to create her.  ||16||  Gazing at her, Lakshmana, whose eyes were as steady as clay idols, was overcome by desire, even though he was a valiant warrior. ||17|| He thought to himself, "If I do not obtain this jewel of a woman, then my kingdom is futile and my life is empty." ||18|| With respect, Lakshmana said to Narada, "O Lord, why did those princes grieve you by describing my virtues?" ||16|| "I will destroy the arrogance of those wicked, insignificant men who do not consider the consequences of their actions and are devoid of hearts." ||20|| "O great sage, the dust from the blow they struck has become pure by resting on your head. I consider that blow to have been struck on my head. Therefore, may you be well." ||21|| Saying this, Lakshmana, filled with anger, summoned the king of the Vidyadharas, Viravitha, and said, "I must quickly attack Ratnapura." ||22|| "Therefore, show me the way."  Upon hearing this, Viravitha, the valiant warrior who obeyed orders strictly, wrote letters and summoned all the Vidyadhara kings. ||23||  Then, the rulers of the cities on the mountains of Mahendra, Vindhya, Kishkindha, and Malaya, covering the sky with their flying chariots, arrived in Ayodhya. ||24|| Surrounded by a vast army of those Vidyadhara kings, Lakshmana, with Ramachandra in front of him, marched towards victory, just as the gods march surrounded by the Lokapalas. ||25|| Kings, adorned with white umbrellas and whose armies had obscured the sun's rays with their various weapons, reached Ratnapura. ||26|| Upon learning of the approaching army, the king of Ratnapura, skilled in warfare, marched out with all his vassals. ||27|| As soon as the king, who possessed great speed, emerged, the entire southern army was overwhelmed in an instant. ||28|| Then, a fierce battle ensued, fueled by arrogance, with weapons like chakras, krakacha, arrows, swords, spears, nooses, and maces. ||26||

## The Thirty-Ninth Chapter

The Apsaras, arranged in the sky in appropriate places, showered flower offerings in places filled with wonder. ||30|| Then, in the midst of the ocean of warriors, Lakshmana, the great fire, was ready to expand, destroying the warriors like water creatures. ||31|| Chariots, excellent horses, and elephants, spewing forth their maddening water, were scattered in all ten directions, like grass before his speed. ||32|| Rama, wielding the power of Indra, engaged in playful combat, while Sugriva, the king of Kishkindha, excelled in the art of war. ||33|| Elsewhere, Hanuman, the hero with the blazing mane, the fierce-hearted, the wielder of the tail, was performing various wondrous feats. ||34|| Just as the morning clouds of autumn are scattered by the wind, so too was the great army of the Vijayardha mountain scattered by these mighty warriors. ||35|| Then, the kings of the Vijayardha mountain, their ambitions shattered, fled towards their own places, accompanied by their lord. ||36|| Seeing those valiant sons of Ratnaratha fleeing, Narada, the lover of strife, filled with utmost anger, made a loud sound, clapping his hands in the sky. ||37-38|| "Ah! These are the fickle, angry, wicked, and foolish sons of Ratnaratha, who fled, unable to bear the excellence of Lakshmana's qualities. ||39|| O humans! Seize these arrogant ones by force! Having disrespected me then, where are you fleeing now?" ||40|| Upon hearing this, many valiant heroes, who had achieved victory and were renowned for their prowess, set out to capture them. ||41|| As they approached, the city of Ratnapura became like a forest engulfed in a great fire. ||42|| At that time, there was a beautiful maiden, a jewel in herself, surrounded by her friends, who delighted the hearts of all who saw her. ||43|| 

Page #204:

Panpuraana
Mounted on a chariot adorned with a garland of flowers, overwhelmed by great love, he approached Saumitri, like Pauloma approaching Vidojas. ||4|| Then, accompanied by those who offered him gifts, Lakshmana, having obtained the gift, became free from all impurities, his face devoid of frowns. ||15|| Then, along with his sons, whose pride had been extinguished, the king Ratnaratha, adorned with auspicious offerings, joyfully departed from the city. ||46|| Knowing the laws of time and place, and having witnessed the prowess of both his own and others, he duly praised Rama and Lakshmana, whose banners bore the emblems of the lion and the Garuda. ||7|| In the midst of this gathering, amidst a vast multitude, Narada, with a gentle smile, addressed Ratnaratha, saying, "Oh Ratnaratha, what news do you bring? Were you a chariot of jewels or a chariot of dust? You were boasting about your great warriors, so how are you now?" ||48-49|| "It seems that you are not the same Ratnaratha, the mountain of pride, but some other king, devoted to the service of the feet of Narayana." ||50|| Then, making a sound of laughter and clapping his hands, he said, "Oh, sons of Ratnaratha, are you well?" ||51|| "This is the same Narayana, about whom you, with your arrogant behavior in your own home, spoke words that gripped the heart." ||52|| "Even though this is true, we are grateful to you, Narada, for this is the fruit of your anger, that we have been blessed with the rare opportunity to meet such great men." ||53|| Thus, with these humorous tales, they lingered for a moment, and then, with great splendor, they all entered the city. ||54||
At that time, a maiden named Shridhama, whose beauty was like that of Rati, and who delighted even the gods, was given to Rama. Obtaining such a woman, Rama, whose influence was like that of Mount Meru, and who had taken her hand in marriage, was overjoyed. ||55|| Then, King Ratnaratha, for the sake of Lakshmana, who was destined to destroy Dashaasya, gave birth to Manorama. The story of these two is a tale of great fortune. ||56||
Manorama, the maiden, approached Lakshmana in the same way that Indrani approaches Indra. ||43-44|| Having obtained this maiden, who was accompanied by those who offered her gifts, and who herself was worthy of receiving gifts, Lakshmana's impurities were cleansed, and his face became free of frowns. ||45|| After that, King Ratnaratha, whose pride had been extinguished, who knew the laws of time and place, who had witnessed the prowess of both his own and others, and who was adorned with auspicious offerings, joyfully departed from the city along with his sons. ||46-47|| In the midst of this gathering, amidst a vast multitude, Narada, with a gentle smile, addressed Ratnaratha, saying, "Oh Ratnaratha, what news do you bring? Were you a chariot of jewels or a chariot of dust? You were boasting about your great warriors, so how are you now?" ||48-49|| "It seems that you are not the same Ratnaratha, the mountain of pride, but some other king, devoted to the service of the feet of Narayana." ||50|| Then, making a sound of laughter and clapping his hands, he said, "Oh, sons of Ratnaratha, are you well?" ||51|| "This is the same Narayana, about whom you, with your arrogant behavior in your own home, spoke words that gripped the heart." ||52|| "Even though this is true, we are grateful to you, Narada, for this is the fruit of your anger, that we have been blessed with the rare opportunity to meet such great men." ||53|| Thus, with these humorous tales, they lingered for a moment, and then, with great splendor, they all entered the city. ||54||

## Chapter Forty-Nine

Other celestial beings in the southern range of the Vijayardha mountain, who were shrouded in darkness of weapons, were subdued by Lakshmana. ||1|| Those celestial beings, who were previously as formidable as great serpents, became free from the poison of pride and became servants of Rama. ||2|| O King! I will now tell you some of the names of those cities, which possess brilliance like that of heaven. Listen. ||3|| The cities are: Ravinibha, Vahniprabha, Kanchana, Megha, Shivamandira, Gandharvagita, Amritapura, Lakshmidhara, Kinnarodgita, Jimutashikhara, Martyanugita, Chakrapura, Rathanupura, Bahurava, Malaya, Shrigriha, Bhaskarabha, Ariñjaya, Jyotipura, Shashichhaya, Gandhara, Malaya, Singhapura, Shrivijayapura, Yakshapura, and Tilakapura. O Purushottama! Lakshmana, the great soul, subdued these and many other excellent cities. ||4-6|| Thus, Lakshmana, the handsome, subdued the entire earth and, adorned with seven treasures, attained the complete state of Narayana. ||10|| The seven treasures, Chakra, Chatra, Dhanush, Shakti, Gada, Mani, and Khadga, were obtained by Lakshmana. ||11|| [Similarly, the four treasures, Hal, Musala, Gada, and Ratnamala, were obtained by Rama.] Then, the king Shrenika said to Gautama Swami, "O Bhagavan! By your grace, I have learned the greatness of Rama and Lakshmana according to the scriptures. Now, I wish to know the origin of Lavanaṅkusha and the birth of Lakshmana's sons. You are worthy of telling me." ||12-13|| 

Then, the lord of the assembly of sages, Shri Gautama Ganadhara, said in a loud voice, "O King! Listen, I will tell you the story you desire." ||14|| Rama and Lakshmana, the principal men of the age, were born with the enjoyment of a vast kingdom, free from thorns, and were devoted to the great happiness granted by the god Dodundaka. Thus, their days, fortnights, months, years, and yugas passed. ||15-16||

The Forty-Ninth Chapter

There were seventeen thousand women in Lakshmana's retinue, who were equal to the celestial nymphs and born in noble families. ||17|| Among them were eight Mahadeviyas, who were like unto Kirti, Lakshmi and Rati, endowed with virtues, character, arts, gentleness and beautiful movements. ||18|| O King! Listen to the beautiful names of those Mahadeviyas, as they are mentioned in order. ||16|| First was Vishalya, the daughter of King Drona-Megha, then the incomparable beauty, Rupavati, then the third, Vanamala, who was like unto the Lakshmi of Spring, and whose very name indicated great virtues, then the fourth, Kalyanamala, then the fifth, Ratimala, who was like unto Ratimala in beauty, then the sixth, Jitapdma, who had conquered the lotus with her mouth, then the seventh, Bhagavati, and the eighth, Manorama. These eight were the chief wives of Lakshmana. ||20-23|| Ramachandra had eight thousand wives, who were like unto the celestial nymphs. Among them were four Mahadeviyas, who were renowned throughout the world. ||24|| The first was Sita, the second, Prabhavati, the third, Ratinibha, and the fourth, Shridhama. ||25|| Among all these, Sita, with her beautiful features, shone like the moon among the stars. ||26|| Lakshmana had two hundred and fifty sons. I shall mention some of their names. Listen! ||27|| Vrishabha, Dharana, Chandra, Sarabha, Makaradhvaja, Dharana, Harinaga, Shridhara, Madana and Achyuta. ||28|| Among these sons, there were eight chief princes, who were endowed with beautiful movements, and whose virtues attracted men, who became devoted to them. ||26|| The first was Shridhara, the son of Vishalya-Sundari, who shone in Ayodhya like the moon in the sky. ||30|| The son of Rupavati was known as Prithivitalaka, who was renowned throughout the earth, and who carried the radiance of the earth. ||31|| The son of Kalyanamala was known as Mangala, who was the recipient of many blessings, and who was always eager to perform auspicious rites. ||32|| The son of Padmavati was named Vimala-Prabha.

In the Padma Purana, 
King Ativirya's daughter, Srikeshi, gave birth to a son named Srikeshi.  
The son of Bhagavati was known as Satyakiriti. ||3||
Manorama had a son named Supaashvakiriti. ||34||
All these princes were very powerful and skilled in both weapons and scriptures. ||35||
Their brotherhood was as strong as flesh and bone, and their righteous conduct was praised everywhere. ||36||
They were close to each other's hearts, their minds filled with love. These eight princes, like the eight Vasus in heaven, enjoyed themselves in their city as they pleased. ||37||
Gautama Swami says that the actions of beings who have accumulated merit in previous lives and whose minds are filled with good intentions are always beautiful from birth. ||38||
Thus, in that city, there were a total of four and a half crore princes, renowned for their extraordinary power and extremely beautiful. ||38-36||
There were sixteen thousand kings, dwelling in various countries, adorned with crowns on their heads, and whose brilliance was like the sun, who served the feet of Rama and Lakshmana. ||40||
Thus ends the ninety-ninth chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the Arsha, narrated by Acharya Srivishena, which describes the glories of Rama and Lakshmana. ||64||

## The Fifty-ninth Chapter

Thus, as the days passed, filled with the enjoyment of worldly pleasures and deeply engaged in the pursuit of Dharma, Artha, and Kama, [1] Janaki, sleeping comfortably in her palace, resembling a celestial chariot, [2] on a bed as soft as a garland of autumn clouds, [3] saw a dream in the last watch of the night, her lotus-like eyes closed. She was awakened by the auspicious sounds of divine instruments. [4] 

Then, as the morning dawned, pure and bright, filled with doubts, Janaki, having performed her daily rituals, went to her beloved, accompanied by her friends. [5] She asked, "My Lord, O learned one, I have seen a dream. You are worthy to interpret its meaning." [6]

"I saw two magnificent Ashtapadas, their radiance like the autumn moon, their sound like a churning ocean, their form like the peak of Kailasa, adorned with all ornaments. Their noble tusks were white and radiant, and their beautiful manes were adorned. I believe these two noble Ashtapadas entered my mouth." [7-8]

"Then, in another dream, I saw myself falling from the peak of the Pushpaka chariot, driven by the wind, like a banner, and landing on the earth." [9]

Padmanabha then said, "O blessed one, seeing a pair of Ashtapadas signifies that you will soon have two sons." [10]

"My dear, though falling from the front of the Pushpaka chariot is not auspicious, do not worry. By performing acts of peace and charity, the planets of misfortune will be pacified." [11]

Then, Spring arrived, adorned with a garland of flowers, riding on an elephant made of Kadamba trees, wielding a bow made of mango wood, armed with arrows made of lotus, carrying a quiver full of Bakul flowers, his glory sung by a chorus of pure-toned bumblebees. He breathed the fragrant air of Kadamba trees, as if he were sighing, and laughed at his enemies, as if illuminated by the light of Malati flowers. He sang sweetly, like a cuckoo, with his melodious voice. [12-13]

---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
The spring season, adorned with the beauty of the king, causing agitation in the world, was engaged in pleasant conversation. ||14||
Its nails were Angkot flowers, it wore a Kurvak beard, its eyes were red Ashoka flowers, its tongue was a fluttering bud, it had acquired supreme fear in the minds of foreign people, and its neck hair was Bakul flowers. Such a spring lion arrived. ||15-16||
The Mahendrodaya garden of Ayodhya was beautiful by nature, but at that time, due to spring, it became as beautiful as Nandanvana. ||17||
Trees with various colorful flowers blooming and various types of leaves swaying, were as if mad, whirling in the face of the south wind. ||18||
The ponds, covered with lotuses, blue lotuses, etc., were filled with the sounds of flocks of birds, and their banks were served by people, were shining brightly. ||19||
The melodious sounds of swans, cranes, ducks, cuckoos, and carandas birds, which were difficult for passionate people to bear, began to be heard. ||20||
The pure water, agitated by their falling and rising, was becoming turbulent, as if filled with joy. ||21||
In the expansion of spring, the water was filled with lotuses, etc., the land with Kurvaks, etc., and the sky with their pollen. ||22||
At that time, clusters, shrubs, creepers, and trees, all kinds of plant species, were situated in various ways, achieving supreme beauty from all sides. ||23||
At that time, seeing Janakanandini, whose body was somewhat weakened by the fatigue caused by the womb, Rama asked, "O beloved! What do you like? Tell me. I will fulfill your desire. Why are you becoming like this?" ||24-25||
Then, Sita, with a lotus-like face, smiled and said, "O Lord! I wish to see many temples situated on the earth." ||26||
My desire is to respectfully bow down to the five-colored images of the Jinas, whose form is auspicious for the three worlds. ||27||
My great faith is to worship the Jina with golden and jeweled flowers. What else do I desire? ||28||

The Fifty-ninth Festival

Hearing this, Padmaabha, with a smiling face and full of joy, addressed the doorkeeper, who had bowed down at that moment, saying, "O Kalyani! Tell the minister to make arrangements without delay. Let there be a grand celebration in the Jinalayas." (26-30)

Let all the people, with great respect, go to the Mahendrodya Garden and adorn the Jina temples. (31)

Let them perform Jina worship throughout the world with toranas, flags, bells, lamboos, spheres, crescent moons, canopies, very beautiful clothes, and all other very beautiful equipment. (32-33)

Let the temples of Nirvana Dhamas be decorated especially, and let great joys, accompanied by all wealth, be initiated. (34)

The Vaideyas, who perform the puja in them, are auspicious and beneficial. I will wander with her, increasing the glory of the Jina Dharma. (35)

Having been instructed by her, the doorkeeper, appointing another woman like herself, told the minister as instructed. The minister, in turn, immediately instructed his servants. (36)

Then, those servants, with great zeal and joy, quickly went and decorated the Jina temples. (37)

In the temples, whose grand entrances were like the caves of great mountains, full kalasas, adorned with garlands and other ornaments, were installed. (38)

On the wide walls of the temples, made of gold, were spread beautiful paintings, attracting the mind with their gem-like designs. (39)

On the pillars were placed very pure and clear mirrors made of gems, and in front of the windows hung beautiful garlands, like clear waterfalls. (40)

Various designs were drawn on the ground where people's feet touched, with beautiful gem-like powder of five colors. (41)

Lotuses, with one hundred or one thousand petals, and with long stems, were placed on the thresholds of the temples and in other places. (42)

In places accessible to the hand, a network of tinkling bells was installed, making a sound like that of a lustful woman. (43)

Pattalambhoos, adorned with five colors, with variegated, shining, and beautiful mandidandakas, were hung loosely. (44) 

Page #212:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
Numerous, extremely beautiful, and diverse garlands were spread out, attracting bees with their fragrance. These were crafted by the finest artisans. ||45||
The garden was adorned with numerous, grand musical halls and spectator galleries. ||46||
Thus, with such extremely beautiful and vast splendors, the Mahendrodya garden became as beautiful as Nandana. ||47||
**Arya Chanda**
**16.4**
Then, accompanied by the citizens of his kingdom, the Asura king, and the goddesses, Padma, along with Sita, went to the garden, accompanied by all his ministers. ||48||
Padma, seated on a magnificent elephant, with Sita by his side, shone brightly, just as Indra, the lord of the gods, shines on the back of Airavata with Sachi. ||49||
Similarly, Narayana, carrying the supreme prosperity, went forth, while the rest of the people, always joyful, elated, and blessed with abundant food and drink, followed. ||50||
The goddesses resided in the beautiful Kadali houses and the delightful, open-roofed arbors, with great splendor, while the other people sat comfortably in their respective places. ||51||
Descending from the elephant, Rama, like Indra in the ocean of milk, joyfully played in the lake, filled with lotuses and blue lotuses, vast like the ocean, with pure water. ||52||
After playing in the lake for a long time, they plucked flowers, emerged from the water, and, with divine materials for worship, worshipped the Jina, along with Sita. ||53||
The charming Rama, surrounded by the most excellent women, resembling the forest goddesses, shone brightly, as if the embodied spring had arrived. ||54|| 

Page #213:

The Ninety-Fifth Chapter

Surrounded by eight thousand incomparable goddesses, the pure-bodied Rama was shining like the moon surrounded by stars. ||55||
In that garden, Rama enjoyed the supreme pleasures of sound, taste, form, fragrance, and touch, arising from ambrosial food, unguents, beds, seats, dwellings, perfumes, and garlands. ||56||
Thus, the radiant Rama, adorned with excellent women, became deeply attached to the daily worship and rituals performed in the Jina temple. ||57||
Thus ends the Ninety-Fifth Chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the Arsha, narrated by Acharya Sri Ravishena, describing the Jina-worship in the form of Dohas. ||65||
1.  Apa + Udharam.

## The Sixth Canto

**1.** Thus, with a pure heart, Rama was situated in the garden called Mahendrodudaya. The people, as if thirsty, approached him, desiring his darshan.

**2.** The news of the people's arrival was conveyed to Sita by the doorkeepers, following tradition. As soon as Sita heard this news, her right eye twitched.

**3.** Sita thought, "What does this twitching eye below signify for me? It must be a sign of some great sorrow coming my way."

**4.** "The wicked fate has caused me sorrow in the midst of the ocean. It seems he is not satisfied with that, I wonder what else he will bring upon me?"

**5.** "The fruits of the actions performed by living beings, which are created by themselves, are inevitable. It is impossible to prevent them."

**6.** "Just as the sun, though nurtured by the moon, constantly consumes it with its own heat, so too, one constantly experiences the fruits of their actions."

**7.** "Oh, wise goddesses! You have heard the scriptures. Please consider carefully and tell me what is the fruit of this twitching of my lower eyelid."

**8.** Among those goddesses, there was one named Anumati, who was skilled in making decisions. She said, "Oh, goddess! What other law is there to be seen in this world?"

**9.** "Whatever action was performed in the past, whether good or bad, is called Krtaanta, Vidhi, Daiva, or Ishvara."

**10.** "To say that I have been brought to this state by the separate Krtaanta is a statement based on ignorance."

**11.** Then, another goddess named Gunamala, who knew the virtues and vices, spoke to the sorrowful Sita, comforting her. "Oh, goddess! You are the most beloved of the Lord, and it is through your grace that others find happiness."

**12.** "Therefore, even with a careful mind, I cannot see any reason for sorrow that will befall you, who are so virtuous." 

Page #215:

## The Sixteenth Chapter

The other goddesses there asked, "What is the use of this lengthy debate, Devi? Let peace be established through a grand ceremony." || 14 || "Let there be abhishekas (consecrations) of the Jinas, generous pujas (worship), and dana (charity) given with a desire to fulfill the wishes of the recipients. Let the inauspicious karma be eradicated." || 15 || 

Hearing this, Sita Devi said, "You have spoken well, goddesses. Dana, puja, abhisheka, and tapas (austerity) are all destroyers of inauspicious karma." || 16 || "Dana destroys obstacles, removes enmity from enemies, brings about the accumulation of punya (merit), and leads to great fame." || 17 || 

Saying this, Sita called for Bhadrakalasha, the treasurer, and said, "Let dana be given to the expectant mothers every day, whatever they desire." || 18 || 

"As you command," said the treasurer and went away. Sita, engrossed in the reverence for the Jinas and their worship, remained there. || 19 || 

Then, in the houses of the Jinas, the sounds of musical instruments arose, a mixture of conch shells and trumpets, resembling the roar of thunder during the rainy season. || 20 || 

Pictures depicting the lives of the Jinas were displayed, and kalashas filled with milk, ghee, and other offerings were brought. || 21 || 

A man adorned with ornaments, riding an elephant, and wearing white clothes, announced in Ayodhya, "Who desires what?" || 22 || 

Thus, dana was given with great enthusiasm, following proper procedures. Devi Sita, with her own power, established various rules. || 23 || 

Grand pujas and abhishekas were performed with great splendor. People, freed from the burden of sin, became peaceful and calm. || 24 || 

While Sita, with a peaceful mind, was engaged in these activities, Ramachandra, powerful like Indra, sat in the assembly hall. || 25 || 

The gatekeepers, having opened the gates, were anxious. The people of the city, fearing as if they were going to the lion's den, entered the assembly hall. || 26 || 

Seeing the magnificent assembly hall, built of jewels and gold, something they had never seen before, the minds of the people were stirred. || 27 || 

Page #216:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, seeing Rama, who brings joy to the heart and celebration to the eyes, the people, their minds elated, folded their hands in salutation. ||28|| Seeing the people, their bodies trembling, their minds repeatedly shaking, Padma said, "O noble ones! Tell me the reason for your arrival." ||29|| Then Vijay, Suraji, Madhuman, Vasula, Dhara, Kashyap, Pingala, Kala, Kshema, and other great men, overwhelmed by the king's influence, could not speak. They stood still, their eyes fixed on his feet, their vigor gone. ||30-31|| Although their intellect was eager to speak for a long time, their speech, like a bride, did not emerge from the house of their mouths with great difficulty. ||32|| Then Padma, with comforting words, spoke again, "Welcome, tell me the purpose for which you have come." ||33|| Even after being told this, they remained devoid of all senses. Standing still, they seemed as if a skilled craftsman had created them as clay toys and placed them there. ||34|| Their throats bound by the fetter of shame, their eyes somewhat restless like the young of deer, their hearts deeply troubled, those people were devoid of joy, their faces pale. ||35|| Then the leader among them, speaking in broken words, said, "O God! Grant us protection and be pleased." ||36|| Then King Ramachandra said, "O noble men! You have nothing to fear, reveal what is in your hearts and attain peace." ||37|| "I now abandon all sin and accept the pure, just as a swan, abandoning mixed water, accepts only milk." ||38|| Then, even after obtaining protection, Vijay, who had difficulty stabilizing his words, folded his hands and said in a soft voice, "O Lord! O Rama! O best of men! Hear my request. All the people have now become devoid of righteousness." ||39-40|| This human world, by its very nature, is very deceitful. Having seen a clear example, nothing is difficult for it. ||41||

**42.** The monkey is naturally very fickle. What to say if it is mounted on a cage-like, fickle machine?

**43.** Young women, endowed with beauty, are abducted by wicked-minded, strong men from those who are weak.

**44.** A man, deeply distressed by the separation from his virtuous beloved, brings her back home with the help of someone.

**45.** O Lord! Until the earth is destroyed, let some remedy be devised for the welfare of the people, as Dharma and its principles are fading away.

**46.** In rivers, gardens, assemblies, villages, resting places, roads, cities, and houses, there is no other talk except this one, "Avarnavada."

**47.** King Dasharatha's son Rama, well-versed in all scriptures, brought back Janaki, abducted by the king of the Vidyadharas.

**48.** There is no fault in adopting such conduct, for the wise are the supreme authority for the world.

**49.** Moreover, whatever the king does, the same is done by us, his followers.

**50.** O Kakutstha! Thus, wicked-minded men are roaming freely on earth. Subdue them.

**51.** If this one fault had not been in your kingdom, it would have delayed even Indra's empire.

**52.** Hearing this, the king was struck by a moment of sorrow, his heart greatly agitated by the blow of the mace of grief.

**53.** He thought, "Alas! This great misfortune has befallen me. The fire of disgrace has ignited to burn my lotus-like fame."

**54.** The very act that caused me unbearable pain of separation, is now staining my lineage, my family's moon.

**55.** The virtuous Sita, whom the valiant monkeys, aiming at her, made impure, is the same Sita who is the moon of my lineage.

**56.** If a suitable example is found, then nothing is difficult for one who is inherently crooked.

**41.** The monkey is naturally very fickle. What to say if it is mounted on a cage-like, fickle machine?

**43.** Wicked-minded, strong men, taking advantage of the opportunity, abduct young women from those who are weak.

**44.** A man, deeply distressed by the separation from his virtuous beloved, brings her back home with the help of someone.

**45.** O Lord! Until the earth is destroyed, let some remedy be devised for the welfare of the people, as Dharma and its principles are fading away.

**46.** In rivers, gardens, assemblies, villages, resting places, roads, cities, and houses, there is no other talk except this one, "Avarnavada."

**47-48.** King Dasharatha's son Rama, well-versed in all scriptures, brought back Janaki, abducted by the king of the Vidyadharas.

**49-50.** There is no fault in adopting such conduct, for the wise are the supreme authority for the world. Moreover, whatever the king does, the same is done by us, his followers.

**51.** Thus, wicked-minded men are roaming freely on earth. O Kakutstha! Subdue them.

**52.** If this one fault had not been in your kingdom, it would have delayed even Indra's empire.

**53.** Hearing this, the king was struck by a moment of sorrow, his heart greatly agitated by the blow of the mace of grief.

**55.** The very act that caused me unbearable pain of separation, is now staining my lineage, my family's moon.

**56.** The virtuous Sita, whom the valiant monkeys, aiming at her, made impure, is the same Sita who is the moon of my lineage.

**41.** If a suitable example is found, then nothing is difficult for one who is inherently crooked. 

Page #218:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
It is for this reason that I fought the battle, destroying my enemies. This Janaki, the mirror of my lineage, is defiling me. ||5||
The people rightly say that a man who is wicked in his own house, is worthy of blame. Why did I bring Sita, who is worthy of blame, into my house? ||5||
I become consumed with longing when I do not see her even for a moment. How can I abandon this beloved, who is filled with love? ||56||
She resides in my eyes and mind. How can I abandon Janaki, who is a treasure trove of virtues and without fault? ||60||
Or, who knows the nature of the minds of women, in whom Kama, the cause of all faults, resides? ||61||
Shame on that woman, who is the source of all faults, the cause of suffering, and difficult to abandon for men born of pure lineage. ||62||
She is the destroyer of all strengths, the refuge of attachment, the ultimate cause of the destruction of memories, the pit that causes the fall of truth, the obstacle to the happiness of liberation, the destroyer of the source of knowledge, like fire covered in ashes, like the needle of a weaver, or beautiful to behold. Therefore, like a snake shedding its skin, I abandon Vaidehi, desiring to escape great suffering. ||63-65||
My heart, bound by the intense bond of love, is always filled with her. How can I abandon this primary source? ||66||
Although I am steadfast in my resolve, Vaidehi, who is near, is like a flame, capable of consuming my mind. ||67||
I believe that just as the line of the moon, though distant, is capable of moving the Kumudini, so too is this beautiful Sita capable of moving my fortitude. ||68||
On the one hand, there is public censure, and on the other, love that is difficult to abandon. Alas! I am caught between fear and desire, trapped in a dense forest. ||69||
She is superior in every way, even to the celestial nymphs. How can I abandon that virtuous Sita, who has attained unity through love? ||70||
If I do not abandon her, I will be publicly disgraced. There is no one on earth like me in this regard.

## The Ninety-Ninth Chapter

**201**

**Vasantatilaka Vrittam**

The mind of Rama, bound by the intense force of mixed emotions, filled with love, reproach, and fear, was overwhelmed by deep sorrow. That time was an unparalleled torment for him. ||72||

**Vamsasthavrittam**

His thoughts were filled with contradictions, both past and present, causing immense turmoil. They were devoid of any stable resolve and filled with the pain of separation. This contemplation was more unbearable than the midday sun in the summer. ||73||

Thus ends the Ninety-Ninth Chapter of the Padma Purana, titled "Janaparivaadachinta", narrated by the revered Acharya, known as Arsha. ||66||

**Notes:**

* **Janaparivaadachinta:** This refers to the chapter's theme of public criticism and its impact on Rama.
* **Vasantatilaka Vrittam & Vamsasthavrittam:** These are specific poetic meters used in the verses.
* **Arsha:** This is a title given to the author of the Padma Purana, often attributed to Rishi Vyasa.

## The Seventy-Seventh Chapter

Then, somehow fixing his mind on one thing, Shri Rama ordered the doorkeeper to call Lakshmana. ||1||

Hearing the doorkeeper's words, Lakshmana, whose mind was focused on his duties, was filled with anxiety. He mounted his swift steed and went to Shri Rama. ||2||

Reaching Shri Rama's presence, he bowed with folded hands and sat on the beautiful earth, his gaze fixed on his feet. ||3||

Shri Rama, whose body was bent in humility and who was the epitome of obedience, raised Lakshmana himself and seated him on an ardha-asana. ||4||

The kings, led by Shatrughna, including Chandrodar and Tut, entered with permission and sat down in their respective places. ||5||

The purohit, the city's chief, the ministers, and other noblemen sat down in their appropriate places, filled with curiosity. ||6||

Then, after standing for a moment, Balarama, in due course, informed Lakshmana of the slander that had arisen. ||7||

Hearing this, Sumitra's son, his eyes red with anger, ordered the warriors to prepare and then spoke again: "Today, I will reach the end of the ocean of wickedness and cover the earth with the tongues of those who speak falsely. ||8-9||

I will destroy those who hate the virtuous and profound Sita, who embodies the perfect character and bears the weight of noble qualities. They will be reduced to nothing." ||10||

Then, seeing Lakshmana, who was consumed by anger and had caused turmoil in the assembly, Shri Rama calmed him with these words: "O gentle one! This earth, extending to the ocean's edge, has been protected for ages by the best of men, like Lord Rishabhadeva and Bharat Chakravarti." ||11-12||

Kings like Arka Kirti were the jewels of the Ikshvaku dynasty. Just as no one can see the back of the moon, so too, their enemies could not see their backs in battle. ||13||

Their glorious deeds, shining like a moonlit cloth, adorned the three worlds, leaving no space untouched. ||14||

## Chapter Seventy-Seven
203
How can I, a sinner, defile this lineage for the sake of mere affection? I would be making my life meaningless and impure. ||15||
Even a small amount of infamy, if ignored, grows. Even a small amount of fame is used by the gods. ||16||
What is the use of even the most magnificent and fleeting pleasures when the garden of fame is being burnt by the fire of infamy? ||17||
I know that Devi Sita is virtuous and pure of heart, but as long as she remains in our house, this slander cannot be dispelled by any weapon or scripture. ||18||
See, the sun, which brings joy to the lotus grove, sets at night. Who can stop it? ||19||
My radiance is being diminished by the dust of slander, which has spread far and wide. Let this not be left unchecked. ||20||
Brother, I am striving to ensure that our lineage, pure as the moon, does not become clouded by the dark lines of infamy. ||21||
Just as fire, devoid of water, grows in a pile of dry fuel, so too, let this infamy not grow in the world. ||22||
This lineage of mine is great, luminous, pure, and radiant. Take immediate action before it is stained. ||23||
I may abandon Vaidehi, who is innocent and virtuous, but I will not compromise my fame, which is the source of happiness for the world. ||24||
Then, Lakshmana, devoted to his brother's love, said, "O King, you should not grieve over Vaidehi." ||25||
Why are you abandoning Janaki, who is revered by all virtuous women and is blameless in every way, just because of the fear of public slander? ||26||
It is the nature of wicked people to speak ill of the virtuous. Their words do not diminish the true nature of the virtuous. ||27||
Even if someone with eyes poisoned by venom sees the moon as completely black, the moon does not lose its true whiteness. ||28||
The soul of a virtuous being attains self-realization. The true nature of things is not found in external appearances, but in the essence of truth. ||29||
The world is constantly adorned with beauty. ||14|| 

Page #222:
---------------------------
204
Padma Purana
Wise men are not disturbed by the words of ordinary people, just as an elephant is not ashamed by the barking of a dog. ||30||
This strange world, which is constantly changing like waves, is addicted to talking about the faults of others. Its own soul will control it. ||31||
A foolish man who wants to destroy the moon by digging up a stone will undoubtedly destroy himself. ||32||
A wicked man who is eager to gossip and cannot tolerate the virtues of others will surely meet with misfortune. ||33||
Then Balarama said, "Lakshmana, what you are saying is true, and your impartial wisdom is commendable. ||34||
But there is no fault to be seen in a pure-minded man who abandons actions that are against the welfare of the world. On the contrary, his virtues are evident. ||35||
What happiness can there be in the world for a man whose directions are engulfed in flames of slander? What hope can he have for life? ||36||
What is the use of a purpose that creates misfortune? What is the benefit of a medicine that contains poison? And what is the use of strength that does not protect creatures who are in fear? ||37||
There is no purpose in a character that does not make the soul strive for its own good, and what is the benefit of knowledge that does not lead to the knowledge of the spiritual realm? ||38||
The birth of a man whose virtuous wife is taken away by a powerful slander is not considered good. It would be better for him to die. ||39||
Let there be public criticism, even if it is a great fault of mine. I brought Sita back home after she was taken away by another man. ||40||
Sita lived in the garden of the demon's palace for a long time. The messengers, who spoke vile words, begged her for what they desired. Ravana, who was present in the nearby land, looked at her with evil eyes many times and spoke to her as he pleased. ||41||
How can I not be ashamed, or how can it be difficult for fools to bring such a Sita back home? ||43||
It speaks of its own reality. In reality, the true nature of a thing is sufficient for its reality, not its external appearance. ||26|| 

Page #223:

The Seventy-Seventh Chapter
205
Let the commander of the army with the face of death be called immediately. Sita, who is pregnant, should be taken from my house today. ||44||
Thus, Lakshmana, with folded hands and a humble heart, said to the Lord, "O God! It is not right to abandon Janaka's daughter." ||45||
How can the delicate, innocent, and well-nurtured Sita, whose lotus-like feet are very soft, go alone through a dangerous path? ||46||
Abandoned by you, the princess, burdened with pregnancy and overwhelmed with sorrow, will seek refuge in whom? ||47||
What is wrong with Ravana seeing Sita? In the world, do not devotees offer even fallen flowers, etc., to the Jina? Therefore, there is no fault in seeing another. ||48||
O Lord! O Hero! Be pleased. Do not abandon Sita, who is innocent, who has never seen a needle, who is very delicate, and who has devoted her heart to you. ||49||
Then Rama, whose hatred had become very strong, who was burdened with anger, and whose face was displeased, said to his younger brother, "O Lakshmīdhara! You should not say anything further. I have decided to do this, whether it is right or wrong." ||50-51||
Sita will be abandoned in a desolate forest, devoid of any companions. Let her live or die by her own karma. ||52||
Sita, who is a source of sin, will not dwell in my country, or in any noble city, or in any house, even for a moment. ||53||
Then, mounting a chariot drawn by four horses, surrounded by his army, and worshipped by his captives with shouts of "Victory!" and "Joy!", the commander of the army with the face of death, with a white umbrella raised above his head, armed with a bow, and adorned with armor and earrings, set out for the king's presence. ||54-55||
Seeing him approaching in this manner, the women of the city, whose minds were filled with speculation and conjecture, began to discuss the matter in many ways. ||56||
1.  Muktvaanjaliṁ M.
2.  Yathā jātu M.
3.  Vane'khilē B.

## Padma Purana

What is this? Why does this one appear hasty? Towards whom is this one angry? What will happen to whom today? O Mother! This one, who is situated in the midst of the darkness of weapons and who is endowed with brilliance like the sun in the summer season, is terrifying like Yama, the lord of death, with his face like that of Yama. || 57-58 ||

The women of the city, who were engrossed in this story, saw the commander approaching Rama. || 56 ||

Then, bowing his head to the ground, he saluted the Lord and said with folded hands, "O Lord! Give me your command." || 60 ||

Rama said, "Go, bring Sita back quickly. He had expressed a desire to see the Jain temples, so show him the Jain temples on the way. Show him the group of images, which are built on Sammed Shikhar, the Nirvana land of the Tirthankaras, and are skilled in fulfilling desires." || 61-62 ||

After showing him these, take him to the deserted forest called Singhanada, and leave him there. O gentle one! Come back quickly." || 63 ||

Then, without any argument, saying "As you command," the commander went to Sita and said, "O Devi! Get up, get on the chariot, do your desired work, see the Jain temples, and achieve the rise of desired fruits." || 64-65 ||

Thus, Sita, who was being pleased by the commander with sweet words and whose heart was filled with joy, approached the chariot. || 66 ||

Approaching the chariot, she said, "May the fourfold Sangha always be victorious, and may Ramachandra, the Jain devotee, who is devoted to the practice of good conduct, always be victorious." || 67 ||

"If we have done anything unpleasant due to carelessness, may the gods residing in the Jain temples forgive all my offenses." || 68 ||

Sita, who had a very eager heart, said to all her friends with a heart attached to her husband, "O good friends! Stay happily. I will go and pay my respects to the Jain temples, and I will come back soon. There is no great eagerness..." || 69-70 ||

Thus, after being told by Sita and due to the absence of her husband's order, the other women, who were eloquent, did not express their desire to accompany her. ||7||
Then, after paying obeisance to the Siddhas, Sita, with a cheerful face, mounted the radiant chariot, having attained supreme joy. ||72||
Mounted on that chariot, adorned with jewels and gold, she shone like a celestial damsel adorned with a garland of jewels, riding on a celestial chariot. ||73||
Driven by the commander-in-chief, Krtaantavaktra, the chariot, yoked with excellent horses, sped like a swift arrow released by Bharata. ||74||
Perched on a dry tree, the crow, extremely agitated, was making a harsh sound, repeatedly flapping its wings and head. ||75||
A woman, afflicted by great sorrow, with her hair disheveled, and weeping, came forward and began to cry. ||76||
Although Sita saw these inauspicious omens, she continued to move forward with unwavering determination, her mind fixed on the Jina. ||77||
The chariot, traversing the peaks of mountains, ravines, caves, and forests, covered a yojana in the blink of an eye. ||78||
That chariot, yoked with horses as swift as Garuda, adorned with white flags, and resembling the sun's chariot in brilliance, moved forward without any hindrance. ||79||
The chariot, on which Rama's beloved, the queen of the gods, was riding, whose speed was like that of a wish, and whose horses were driven by Krtaantavaktra, the charioteer, was exceedingly beautiful. ||80||
There, Sita, with a slender body supported by a cushion, was seated on an excellent seat, and was moving forward, looking at various kinds of land. ||81||
She saw, with great curiosity, beautiful ponds adorned with lotuses and other flowers, sometimes in villages, sometimes in cities, and sometimes in forests. ||82||
She saw, sometimes, a vast grove of trees, where the dense darkness was like the night covered by a cloud-like sheet, and whose separateness was difficult to discern. ||83||
Sometimes, she saw a forest, whose flowers, fruits, and leaves had fallen, which was thin, with few branches, and whose leaves were sparse, like a widowed woman of a noble family. ||84||

Padma Purana
She saw the forest, like a noble widow whose roots were sparse and who was devoid of radiance (in the form of a husband). ||84|| She saw that somewhere, the beautiful Madhavi creeper, clinging to a mango tree, was desiring the nearby Ashoka tree, like a fickle courtesan. ||5|| She saw that somewhere, a large group of trees, destroyed by a forest fire, were not as beautiful as the heart of a virtuous man, who is tormented by the words of a wicked person. ||86|| She saw that somewhere, the forest queen was dancing, like the wife of spring, with the help of gentle breezes, amidst a network of beautiful creepers. ||7|| She saw that somewhere, a herd of deer had gone far away, frightened by the loud clamor of a group of hunters. ||8|| She saw that somewhere, with her head raised, she was looking at the peak of a mountain, adorned with beautiful ornaments made of various metals, with her curious eyes. ||89|| She saw that somewhere, the forest, with its clear and shallow rivers, looked like a woman whose husband has gone abroad, whose eyes are filled with tears, and who is suffering from separation. ||10|| She saw that somewhere, the forest was engaged in a pleasant conversation, as if through the sounds of various birds, and somewhere, she was laughing joyfully, as if because of the bright waterfalls. ||11|| She saw that somewhere, the forest was being praised by bees, who were greedy for nectar, and she was bowing down, as if under the weight of her fruits, with a slow, intoxicated sound. ||12|| She saw that somewhere, the forest was showering flowers, as if in a gesture of humility, with its beautiful leaves and large branches, which were being shaken by the wind. ||13|| Seeing the forest, which was engaged in such activities and which was full of wild animals, the daughter of Janaka, whose mind was filled with the radiance of Rama, continued on her way. ||14|| Hearing that sweet and very fleshy sound, she wondered if it was the sound of Rama's drum. ||15|| After making this deduction and seeing the Ganges, she realized that the sound she had heard was coming from that direction. ||16|| She saw that the Ganges was being disturbed by playful fish, crocodiles, and other creatures, and that the lotuses were trembling due to the contact of the rising waves. ||17|| She saw that the Ganges was tearing apart the mountains, which were rooted in the earth, and that it was roaring with the force of its waves. ||18||

Chapter Seventy-Seven
203
The river, created by the sons of Sagara, extends to the edge of the ocean, is deep as the netherworld, and adorned with white sandbanks. ||1|| It is terrifying with its huge whirlpools, filled with foam, and is beautified by flocks of birds perched on its banks. ||10|| Horses, swift as the wind, crossed that Ganga, just as the virtuous cross the world with the essence of right knowledge. ||11|| 
Then, though always steadfast like Mount Meru, the commander, Krtaantavaktra, was filled with sorrow, being compassionate. ||102|| Unable to speak, overwhelmed by great grief, and unable to control himself, Krtaantavaktra was overcome by a torrent of tears. ||103|| He stopped his chariot, cried out loudly, placed his hands on his head, and stood there, his body limp and his radiance gone. ||104|| Then, Sita, her heart broken, said, "Krtaantavaktra, why are you weeping like a man in great sorrow? ||105|| You are filling me with sorrow at this time of great joy. Why are you weeping in this desolate forest?" ||106|| "Because of my duty to obey my master's orders, and because I am obliged to speak the truth, I have somehow stopped weeping and have reported the truth." ||107|| "Hearing the words of the wicked, which are like poison, weapons, or fire, Sri Rama, terrified by the ill-repute, abandoned his love for you, which was difficult to abandon, just as a sage abandons worldly desires. ||108-109||  Oh, master! Though Lakshmana tried every way to make him understand your situation, he did not relent. ||110|| Just as a being without a connection to Dharma has no refuge for its happiness,

In the Padma Purana,
Neither Savitri, nor a brother, nor a group of relatives. This forest, filled with deer, is your refuge now, O Devi. ||112||
Hearing your words, she was struck like by a thunderbolt. Filled with sorrow in her heart, she was overcome by delusion. ||113||
With great difficulty, regaining consciousness, with faltering words, she spoke, asking, "Grant me a glimpse of my Lord, even once." ||114||
He replied, "O Devi, that city is now far away. How can you see the Lord, who gives harsh commands?" ||115||
Then, with streams of tears washing her lotus face, though overwhelmed by the nectar of love, she spoke. ||116||
"O Commander, convey this message to Rama from me: O Lord, do not be saddened by my abandonment." ||117||
"O Great Soul, relying on supreme fortitude, always protect your subjects, just like a father, a lover of justice." ||118||
For just as people always desire the moon of the autumn season, so too do people desire a king who has attained the pinnacle of arts and is the cause of joy. ||119||
Be worthy of worshipping that Right-Vision, by which noble beings are liberated from the terrible cycle of birth and death, filled with sorrow. ||120||
O Rama, that Right-Vision is considered more valuable than even an empire, for an empire may perish, but Right-Vision bestows lasting happiness. ||121||
O Best of Men, do not abandon that Right-Vision, even if you are frightened by the disgust of the unworthy, for it is extremely rare. ||122||
A jewel that falls into the ocean, once held in the palm of the hand, can be retrieved by what means? ||123||
A child, throwing the fruit of immortality into a well, filled with great danger, suffers extreme sorrow, filled with regret. ||124||
He who is like that, speaks as he pleases, without restraint. For who can silence the mouth of this world? ||125||
You have no refuge, knowing that your master is without affection. ||111||
O Devi! For you, neither your mother is a refuge, nor your brother, nor your family. At this time, this forest, filled with deer, is your only refuge. ||112||
After that, Sita, hearing his words, was filled with sorrow in her heart, struck like by a thunderbolt, and was overcome by delusion. ||113||
With great difficulty, regaining consciousness, with faltering words, she spoke, asking, "Grant me a glimpse of my Lord, even once." ||114||
In response, Krtaantavaktra said, "O Devi! That city is now far away, so how can you see the Lord, who gives harsh commands?" ||115||
Then, Sita, though washing her lotus face with streams of tears, overwhelmed by the nectar of love, spoke. ||116||
"O Commander! Convey this message to Rama from me: O Lord! Do not be saddened by my abandonment." ||117||
"O Great Soul! Relying on supreme fortitude, always protect your subjects, just like a father, a lover of justice." ||118||
For just as people always desire the moon of the autumn season, so too do people desire a king who has attained the pinnacle of arts and is the cause of joy. ||119||

O Rama! That Right-Vision is considered more valuable than even an empire, for an empire may perish, but Right-Vision bestows lasting happiness. ||121||
O Best of Men! Do not abandon that Right-Vision, even if you are frightened by the disgust of the unworthy, for it is extremely rare. ||122||
A jewel that falls into the ocean, once held in the palm of the hand, can be retrieved by what means? ||123||
A child, throwing the fruit of immortality into a well, filled with great danger, suffers extreme sorrow, filled with regret. ||124||
He who is like that, speaks as he pleases, without restraint. For who can silence the mouth of this world? ||125||

## The Seventy-Seventh Chapter

Even though you will hear many things that destroy the purpose of life, you should not hold them in your heart like a fool. You should act with deliberation. (126)

Just as the sun, though extremely radiant, illuminates all things in the world as they are and never becomes tainted, is therefore dear to all, so too, though you are endowed with strict governance, you should remain true to your nature, knowing all things in the world as they are, and never become tainted, thus remaining dear to all like the sun. (127)

Subdue the wicked by giving them something, keep your loved ones happy by showing them affection, subdue your enemies by being virtuous, and keep your friends happy by serving them with good intentions. (128)

Subdue anger with forgiveness, pride with humility, deceit with honesty, and greed with patience. (129-130)

O Lord, you are proficient in all scriptures, so it is not appropriate for me to give you advice. This is just the fickleness of my heart, which is connected to your love. (131)

O Master, if I have done anything disrespectful due to being under your control or out of jest, please forgive me. (132)

O Lord, it seems that this is all the time I have to see you. Therefore, I say again and again that my actions, whether right or wrong, are all worthy of forgiveness. (133)

Having said this, Sita, who had already descended from the chariot, fell to the ground covered with grass and stones. (134)

Fallen on the earth, Sita, motionless from fainting, appeared as if a collection of jewels had been scattered. (135)

Seeing Sita in such a state, the commander was deeply distressed and thought, "She will barely be able to sustain her life." (136)

In this terrible forest, filled with a multitude of ferocious beasts, even a brave man cannot hope to survive. (137)

Leaving this deer-eyed one in this terrible forest, I do not see a place where I can find peace. (138)

On this side, there is extreme cruelty, and on that side, there is the firm command of my master. Alas! I, a sinner, have fallen into the midst of a great whirlpool of sorrow. (139)

Who is capable of binding the mouth of this world? (125)

Like a wounded deer, she wept. The trees, as if shedding their flowers, also seemed to weep in sympathy. **(152)**

Overwhelmed by immense sorrow, she lamented in a voice as sweet as nature's melody. **(153)**

"Oh, Lotus-eyed one! Oh, Padma! Oh, best of men! Oh, Lord! Oh, God! Please answer me, console me!" **(154)**

"You are always engaged in virtuous deeds, adorned with good qualities, compassionate, and endowed with the qualities of a great man. There is no fault in you for my abandonment." **(155)**

"This is the fruit of my own past actions. I must inevitably endure this intense suffering." **(156)**

"What can my beloved husband, my son, my father, or even Narayana do when my own karma is bearing fruit?" **(157)**

"Surely, I must have accumulated sins in a previous birth, for I am now suffering this extreme pain in this desolate forest, as an unfortunate woman." **(158)**

"I must have spoken falsely about someone in a gathering, for this calamity has befallen me." **(159)**

"I must have broken a vow in a previous birth, in the presence of my Guru, for this is the consequence." **(160)**

"Or perhaps, in another life, I scorned someone with harsh words, like poison-laced fruit, and this is the result of that action." **(161)**

"I believe that in a previous birth, I separated a pair of Chakwā-Chakwi birds who resided in a lotus grove. That is why I am now without my husband." **(162)**

"Or perhaps, I separated a pair of swans who lived in a lake adorned with lotuses, who delayed the journey of noble men, who were known for their sweet calls and beauty, who were as radiant as Lakshmana's palace, and whose faces and feet were as red as lotuses. I must have separated them in a previous birth due to my own misconduct, and that is why I am now suffering this terrible exile, separated from my home." **(163-165)**

"Or perhaps, I separated a pair of lovers whose eyes were like halves of a Guñjā fruit, who had entrusted their hearts to each other, who were as dark as the black pepper plant, and whose wealth and prosperity were as vast as the Himalayas." **(166)**

In the Padma Purana,
I must have separated the pair of doves, who were playing happily, with a sweet, barely audible sound in their throats, with a sinful mind. || 167 ||
Or I must have kept them in an inappropriate place, or tied them up, or killed them, or deprived them of honor, care, and nourishment. That is why I have been subjected to such suffering. || 168 ||
Or perhaps, during the beautiful spring season, when all the trees were adorned with flowers, I must have separated the pair of cuckoos, which resulted in this outcome. || 166 ||
Or perhaps, I must have condemned the ascetics, who were virtuous, upholders of good conduct, masters of their senses, and worthy of praise from the learned. As a result, I have been subjected to this great suffering. || 170 ||
I, who used to reside in a heavenly abode, constantly served by a group of excellent servants who were delighted to receive orders, how can I now dwell in this dense forest, devoid of kin? My store of merit has dwindled, I am submerged in the ocean of sorrow, and I am a great sinner. || 171 ||
I used to sleep comfortably on a magnificent bed, adorned with various gems, covered with a fine sheet, and equipped with all amenities. I used to enjoy the sweet sounds of the flute, the trisarika, and the veena in the morning. || 172 - 174 ||
I, who was the chief queen of Shri Ramdev, am now consumed by the fire of disgrace and am filled with sorrow. How can I, a sinner, dwell alone in this desolate forest, amidst a multitude of insects, harsh thorns, and sharp stones on the earth? || 175-176 ||
If these very breaths remain within me, even after experiencing such a state, then it must be said that my breaths are made of diamond. || 177 ||
Oh, heart! The fact that you do not shatter into a hundred pieces, even after experiencing such a state, shows that there is no other brave soul like you. || 178 ||
What should I do? Where should I go? Whom should I tell? Whose refuge should I seek? How can I stay? Alas, Mother! Why did this happen? || 176 ||
Oh, Ram, the ocean of virtues! Oh, Lakshman, the devotee! Oh, Father! Do you not recognize me? Oh, Mother! Why do you not protect me? || 180 ||
Oh, brother, the lord of the Vidyadharas, adorned with earrings! This is the delusion caused by the cycle of suffering, and I am trapped in it. || 181 ||

Alas, I, a sinner, have been blessed with great wealth, but I have not been able to worship the Jinas in their temples on earth.  ||182||

Seeing Sita in such a state of distress, the king, Vajrajangha, arrived at the forest. ||183||

Vajrajangha, the lord of the city of  Pundarika, had come to the forest to capture elephants. He was returning with great pomp, having captured a magnificent elephant. ||184||

The soldiers in the vanguard of his army, though armed with various weapons, handsome, valiant, and with swords strapped to their sides, were struck with doubt and fear upon hearing Sita's extremely beautiful lament. They could not take a single step forward. ||185-186||

The group of horses in the front of the army also stopped, and even the horsemen, filled with apprehension, could not motivate them to move forward, having heard the sound of her lament. ||187||

They began to ponder: "In this extremely terrifying forest, where there are many creatures who are the cause of death, this beautiful sound of a woman's weeping is heard. What is this strange thing?" ||188||

"Where the deer, buffalo, wolf, cheetah, and lion roam, where the eight-legged creatures and the tigers wander, and where it is terrifying because of the tusks of the boars, in the midst of this forest, who is this one weeping, who is skilled in stealing hearts, like the line of the most pure moon?" ||189||

"Is this the Indraani, who was abandoned by Indra and has come down to earth from the Saudharma heaven? Or is this some goddess who has come from somewhere, who destroys the music of human happiness and brings about the cause of destruction?" ||190||

Thus, the army, which was filled with doubt, had abandoned its efforts, and the original men, who were moving swiftly, had gathered there. The army, which was like a great whirlpool, with a great deal of music playing, and which was filled with wonder, stood still. ||191||

'Makaranda, the horses, were like crocodiles, the valiant foot soldiers were like fish, the elephants were like Prahas, and the army, filled with a loud roar, and shining with the rays of the sun, was like a sea, terrifying with its waves of swords. || 162 ||
Thus ends the ninety-seventh Parva of the Sri Padma Purana, titled 'Sita Nirvasana, Vilapa, and Vajrajangha's Arrival', composed by the Acharya Ravishena, known as Aarsha. || 67 ||

## The Eighth and Ninetieth Chapter

Then, seeing the river Jahnavi, as if obstructed by great knowledge, and the army transformed into a circle, with Vajrajangha mounted on an elephant, he asked the nearby men, "Why are you standing like this? Who has obstructed your journey? Why are you all distressed?"

As the men inquired about the reason for the army's halt, following tradition, the king heard a sound of weeping. He, who had toiled in all the signs, said, "The sound of weeping, so beautiful, belongs to a woman who is pregnant, radiant like the heart of lightning, virtuous, and unparalleled. Surely, she must be the wife of a great man."

"Oh, God! How can there be doubt in your words? You have witnessed many wondrous things before."

While this conversation continued between the servants and the king Vajrajangha, some brave men went forward and approached Sita. They asked, "Oh, Goddess! Who are you in this desolate forest? Why are you lamenting this unbearable sorrow?"

"In this world, we do not see auspicious forms like yours. Are you a goddess? Or some other supreme creation?"

"If you possess such a pure and unburdened body, then this sorrow of yours is completely incomprehensible. Tell us, oh, auspicious one, if this is something worth telling, for we are very curious. Perhaps, by knowing the reason, your sorrow may end."

Then, seeing those men, radiant with the light of various weapons, Sita, whose entire world had been plunged into darkness by great sorrow, trembled violently from fear. Her eyes became restless, and she was ready to give them her ornaments.

Then, those men, bewildered and frightened, said again, "Oh, Goddess! Abandon your fear and sorrow, and take refuge in courage."

~,
In the Padma Purana,
Or adorned with jewels, may they stand on your right. Why are you resorting to emotional yoga? ||15|| This noble man, known as Vajrajanga on earth, has arrived. He is renowned, endowed with all royal virtues, the best of men. ||16|| The jewel of right faith, devoid of similarity, indestructible, unattainable, unstealable, bestowing supreme happiness. ||17|| Free from the dirt of doubt, firm like Mount Meru, he holds this supreme ornament in his heart with a mindful mind. ||18|| O virtuous one, O praiseworthy one, whose right faith shines so brightly, how can we, like ourselves, describe his virtues? ||19|| He who knows the principles of the Jina's teachings, is affectionate towards those who seek refuge, devoted to the welfare of others, compassionate and tender-hearted. ||20|| He is of noble lineage, pure of soul, with a mind free from blameworthy actions, a protector like a father, devoted to the welfare of beings. ||21|| He is a special protector of the poor and helpless, even of mothers. He is a doer of pure actions, a great destroyer of enemies like a mountain. ||22|| He is weary from the practice of weapons and scriptures, but tireless in the work of peace. He knows another man's wife as he knows a well with a serpent. ||23|| He is deeply devoted to Dharma, always fearing the fall from existence. He is truthful, with established righteous speech, and his senses are well-controlled. ||24|| O goddess, whoever wishes to speak of all his virtues, is like trying to cross the ocean with a single arm. ||25|| As long as this story, captivating the mind, continues among them, the king, Vajrajanga, has arrived, somewhat touched by wonder. ||26|| Descending from the elephant, with appropriate humility, Vajrajanga, with his naturally pure vision, looked and spoke thus. ||27|| Oh, it seems that man is made of stone and devoid of consciousness, for he did not tear you to pieces, leaving you in this forest. ||28|| O auspicious one, tell me the reason for this state of yours. Be at ease, do not fear, and do not cause distress to the womb. ||29||

Then, though she had refrained from speaking for a moment due to distress, Sita again wept, her mind tormented by the wheel of sorrow. ||30||

Then, urged by the king, who spoke sweetly, she, suppressing her anger, spoke in a voice choked with grief, like a distressed swan. ||31||

"O King, if you wish to know, then listen with your mind, for this story of mine, an unfortunate woman, is very long. ||32||

I am Sita, the daughter of King Janaka, the sister of Bhamandala, the daughter-in-law of Dasharatha, and the wife of Rama. ||33||

King Dasharatha, by the boon of Kekaya, gave his position to Bharata and embraced the path of an ascetic. ||34||

Therefore, Rama, Lakshmana, and I had to go to the forest. You must have heard, O virtuous one, about all that happened. ||35||

I was abducted by the king of the Rakshasas, Ravana. My husband, Rama, united with Sugriva, and I received news on the eleventh day. ||36||

My husband, after crossing the ocean in celestial chariots, defeated Dashanana in battle and brought me back. ||37||

Bharata, like a chakravarti, renounced his kingdom and embraced the path of a Digambara, shedding the dust of karma and attaining liberation. ||38||

Kekaya, consumed by grief for her son, took initiation and, after performing austerities, ascended to heaven. ||39||

On this earth, people without restraint, with wicked minds, without any doubt, slander me, saying that Ravana, a great scholar, took another man's wife, and Rama, a knower of Dharma Shastra, brought her back and continues to serve her. ||40-41||

The state in which a king with firm resolve conducts himself is also beneficial for us, there is no fault in it. ||42||

When I, with a thin body, became pregnant, I thought, "I will worship all the Jina images on this earth." ||43||

Then, my husband, Rama, who is full of glory, was eager to worship the Jina images in the places of great merit of the Jina. ||44||

He said, "O Sita, first let us go to Mount Kailasa and worship Rishabha, the joy of the world." ||45|| 

Page #238:

## Translation:

Padma Purana

Then, in this Ayodhya city, we will pay homage to the images of Rishabha and other Tirthankaras, which are established in their birthplace, with great splendor. ||46|| Then, we will go to Kampilya city to pay our respects to Vimalnath with devotion, and then we will proceed to Ratnapura city to pay homage to Dharmanath, who teaches the harmony of Dharma. ||47|| In Shravasti, we will pay our respects to Sambhavanath, in Champapuri to Vasupujya, in Kakanda to Pushpadanta, in Kaushambi to Padma Prabha, in Chandrapura to Chandra Prabha, in Bhadraka forest to Shitalnath, in Mithila to Malli Jineshwara, in Varanasi to Suparshva, in Singhapuri to Shreyans, in Hastinapur to Shanti Kunth and Aranath. And, O Devi! After that, we will go to Kushagra Nagar-Rajagriha to pay our respects to the omniscient Muni Suvrata, whose radiant Dharmachakra continues to shine brightly. ||48-51|| Then, O Vaidehi! Due to the extraordinary qualities of the Jina, we will pay homage to all the other extremely sacred places, renowned throughout the world, which are praised and worshipped by the gods, demons, and Gandharvas. ||52-53|| Then, we will ascend the Pushpaka Vimana, quickly cross the sky, and with me, worship the Jina images on the peaks of Mount Meru. ||54|| O beloved! Worship the Jina with flowers from the Bhadrashala forest, the Nandana forest, and the Saumanasa forest. ||55|| Then, O beloved! We will pay homage to all the artificial and natural images in this world and return to Ayodhya. ||56|| Even a single act of homage offered with devotion to the Arhant liberates a being from the sins committed in past lives. ||57|| O beloved! I am also filled with immense joy at the thought of seeing these highly sacred Chaityalayas, as per your wish. ||58|| Earlier, when this time was enveloped in the darkness of ignorance and humans were completely destitute due to the destruction of the Kalpa trees, this world was adorned by the Jina Adinath, just as the moon adorns the sky. ||59|| He was the unique master of the people, the eldest, worshipped by the three worlds, and the teacher of the path to liberation for the fearful and fortunate beings. ||60||

## The Eighth Chapter

This chapter is adorned with eight types of divine powers and various excellences. It is filled with endless wonders and is captivating to gods and demons alike. (11)

He who revealed the pure nature of the soul and other principles to the worthy beings, having fulfilled his duty, attained the ultimate liberation. (12)

The Chakravarti Bharat built a divine temple made of all precious jewels on Mount Kailash and installed the image of the Lord there. (63)

The image, resembling the sun, is five hundred bows high and is divine. It is the image of the unparalleled Lord, and it shines brightly. (64)

Even today, Gandharvas, Devas, Kinnaras, Apsaras, Nagas, and Daityas perform the great worship of the Lord with great care. (65)

The Lord Rishabhadeva is infinite, supreme, perfect, auspicious, Shiva, omnipresent, pure, worthy of worship by the three worlds, self-existent, and self-lord. (66)

When will I go to Mount Kailash, the supreme mountain, and worship the Lord Rishabhadeva with you? (67)

Thus, with great determination, we set out together. But on the way, we encountered the unbearable news of the slander of the people, like a raging fire. (68)

Then, my master, who always acts with deliberation, thought, "This world, by nature, is deceitful and cannot be controlled otherwise." (69)

It is better to face death even by abandoning loved ones, but this slander, which will last until the end of the kalpa, is not good for our reputation. (70)

Although I am innocent, I was abandoned in this dense forest by my wise master, who was afraid of the slander of the people. (71)

This is the nature of a Kshatriya, who is born of a pure lineage, has a noble heart, and is knowledgeable in all scriptures. (72)

Thus, she, the sorrowful Sita, narrated her story related to her exile and began to weep again, consumed by the fire of grief. (73)

Seeing her, whose face was filled with tears and whose body was covered with dust, the king Vanajangha, who possessed the best qualities of character, was also filled with sorrow. (74)

Then, knowing her to be the daughter of King Janaka, King Vanajangha approached her and comforted her with kind words. (75)

In the Padma Purana, you are grieving and lamenting separation, but you are aware of the glory of the Jina teachings. Why are you engaging in this sorrowful meditation, which only increases your suffering? ||76||  O Vaidehi, do you not know that the state of the world is like this: impermanent, without refuge, characterized by oneness and otherness? ||77|| You are grieving repeatedly like a woman with a false perception. You have constantly heard the true meaning from the virtuous. ||78||  Surely, the foolish-hearted being, attached to the cycle of births and deaths, and unaware of the path to liberation, has experienced countless sorrows in this life. ||79||  The being, dwelling in the ocean of existence and immersed in the whirlpool of afflictions, has experienced countless unions and separations. ||80||  As a celestial being, an aquatic being, or a terrestrial being, the being has endured unbearable suffering in the lower realms, born from rain, cold, and heat. ||81||  Even in the human realm, what great suffering has the being not experienced, arising from insults, slander, separation, and abuse? ||82||  In the realm of the gods, the being has experienced great suffering arising from bad conduct, the sight of great wealth, and the fall from that state. ||83||  And, O auspicious one, how can the suffering experienced in the hells be described? It arises from cold, heat, caustic substances, weapons, vicious creatures, and mutual killing and beating. ||84||  O Maithili, in this life, the being has experienced countless separations, anxieties, illnesses, painful deaths, and sorrows. ||85||  There is no place in this world, whether above, in the middle, or below, where the being has not experienced the suffering of birth, death, and old age. ||86||  Driven by the wind of its own karma, the being constantly wanders in the ocean of existence. Even in the human realm, the being has obtained a female body like this. ||87||  You are endowed with the remaining good and bad karmas. Your husband, Rama, is beautiful with virtues and born of auspicious fortune. ||88||  You attained happiness with him, born of auspicious fortune. Now, due to the rise of inauspicious fortune, you have experienced unbearable suffering. ||89||  You reached Lanka, carried by Ravana. There, you stopped wearing garlands and applying unguents, and on the eleventh day... ||90||

Having slain the adversary, she was brought back from there.  She has attained happiness again by the grace of Baldeva. ||1||

She was again impregnated by the evil omen, and was freed from the serpent of slander without any fault. ||12||

He who burns the house of virtuous flowers with abusive words, may that extremely terrible sin be consumed by fire. ||13||

O great Goddess, you are blessed, and your efforts are highly commendable, as you have taken refuge in the abode of the Caitya. ||3||

Even today, you have merit, O virtuous one, as I have seen you in the forest of Maya, brought by the elephant. ||15||

I am the son of the king, born of the lineage of Indra, who is devoted to good deeds, the elephant-charioteer, and the wife of his close relative. ||16||

I am Vajrajangha, the lord of the city of  Pundarika, and you are my elder sister by the law of Dharma, O virtuous one. ||17||

O best one, rise and leave this city of darkness. Even for the sake of the king's daughter, nothing is accomplished. ||3||

If you stay there, she will be filled with remorse, and there is no doubt that Rama will search for you again. ||6||

Who, being a great scholar, would not search for a jewel that has been lost due to carelessness, a jewel that is brilliant and possesses great qualities? ||10||

Being thus advised by him, who was a master of the essence of Dharma, the daughter of Janaka attained fortitude, having found her brother. ||11||

She praised him, saying, "You are my true brother, you are auspicious, glorious, wise, courageous, and compassionate to the virtuous." ||102||

She has attained the right vision, grasped the true meaning, and her soul is purified by the three jewels. She is like a virtuous person, with a pure mind, and is dedicated to the virtues of vows, qualities, and conduct. ||103||

The conduct of a virtuous person, free from faults and dedicated to the welfare of others, does not destroy the sorrow of anyone who is deeply devoted to the teachings of the Jinas. ||10||

By the grace of Sri Rama, she again attained happiness, and became pregnant. She was then freed from the evil omen by the serpent of slander, without any fault. ||60-62||

He who burns the house of virtuous flowers with abusive words, may that extremely terrible sin be consumed by fire.  May your sinful deeds be quickly destroyed. ||3||

O Goddess, you are truly blessed, and your efforts are highly commendable, as you have taken refuge in the abode of the Caitya. ||64||

O virtuous one, even today you have merit, as I have seen you in the forest of Maya, brought by the elephant. ||65||

I am Vajrajangha, the son of the king, born of the lineage of Indra, who is devoted to good deeds, the elephant-charioteer, and the wife of his close relative. I am the lord of the city of Pundarika. O virtuous one, you are my elder sister by the law of Dharma. ||66-67||

O best one, rise and leave this city of darkness. Even for the sake of the king's daughter, nothing is accomplished. ||8||

O faithful wife, if you stay there, she will be filled with remorse, and there is no doubt that Rama will search for you again. ||66||

Who, being a great scholar, would not search for a jewel that has been lost due to carelessness, a jewel that is brilliant and possesses great qualities?  All would want to find it. ||10||

Being thus advised by him, who was a master of the essence of Dharma, the daughter of Janaka attained fortitude, having found her brother. ||101||

She praised him, saying, "You are my true brother, you are auspicious, glorious, wise, courageous, and compassionate to the virtuous. You have attained the right vision, grasped the true meaning, and your soul is purified by the three jewels. You are like a virtuous person, with a pure mind, and are dedicated to the virtues of vows, qualities, and conduct." ||102-103||

The conduct of a virtuous person, free from faults and dedicated to the welfare of others, does not destroy the sorrow of anyone who is deeply devoted to the teachings of the Jinas.  It destroys the sorrow of all. ||10||

She received food. Then, after the enemy Ravana was slain, she was brought back from there, and by the grace of Baldeva...

Indeed, in a previous birth, you must have been my brother, filled with true love. That is why, with your pure soul like the sun, you are dispelling the darkness of my immense grief. ||105||

Thus ends the eighty-ninth chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the *Arsha*, composed by the Acharya Sri Ravishena, which describes the consoling of Sita. ||68||

## The Ninety-Ninth Chapter

And then, in a moment, the king summoned a palanquin, supported by excellent pillars, adorned with various garlands, resembling a celestial chariot, beautiful, built with proper proportions, adorned with excellent mirrors, lanterns, and moon-like white yak-tail whisks, embellished with pearl-like beads, adorned with colorful garments, with large garlands spread out, decorated with paintings, and equipped with excellent windows.  Upon this palanquin, Sita embarked. At that time, Sita was endowed with supreme wealth, moving amidst great warriors, contemplating the intricacies of karma, and filled with wonder.  [1-4]

Sita, bearing the mark of excellent conduct, crossed that formidable forest in three days and entered the land of Pundarika. [5]

The land was covered with all kinds of grain, adorned with villages and towns close together, [6] and so beautiful with cities radiating like heavenly abodes that it was impossible to be satiated by looking at it, and adorned with gardens and parks.  Seeing this land of Pundarika, she continued on her journey. [7]

O Venerable One! O Goddess! O Praiseworthy One! By your sight, we, the beings of the world, have become free from sin and fulfilled. [8]

Thus, the elders of the village, bearing the mark of the king's radiance, offered gifts and repeatedly paid homage to her. [9]

Kings, like gods, honored her with offerings and salutations, praising her at every step. [10]

In due course, she reached the vicinity of Pundarika-pura, a city extremely delightful and served by its inhabitants. [11]

Hearing of Sita's arrival, the officials, by the king's command, quickly decorated the city with great splendor. [12]

The wide roads, with three-way and four-way intersections, were adorned on all sides, sprinkled with fragrant water, and covered with flowers. [13]

Arches, like rainbows, were erected, and pots, completely filled with leaves, were placed at the gates. [14]

Padma Purana
The city, adorned with fluttering flags and garlands, resounded with auspicious sounds. It seemed to be dancing with joy, as if eager to perform a dance. ||15||
The city walls, crowded with people, were like a grand assembly hall. The city seemed to have grown immensely with joy, filled with a cacophony of sounds. ||16||
The entire city, both inside and outside, was filled with a throng of people eager to see Sita. It seemed as if the city itself had become mobile, with people moving everywhere. ||17||
Then, the city was filled with the sounds of various musical instruments, accompanied by the booming of conch shells and the joyous cries of the people. ||18||
With their minds filled with wonder, the citizens of the city watched as Sita entered the city, like Lakshmi entering heaven. ||19||
Sita entered a magnificent palace, surrounded by gardens and adorned with pools. It was as tall as Mount Meru and as white as the complexion of Balarama. ||20||
The palace, located within the Vrajjangha house, was extremely beautiful. Sita, the daughter of Janaka, entered the palace, where she was worshipped by the king's wives. ||21||
The wise Vrajjangha, filled with immense joy, worshipped Sita, his sister, as if she were the sun. ||22||
People chanted, "Victory to Sita! May she live long! May she be happy! May she prosper! May she command!" They also called her, "O Ishana! O Devi! O Revered One! O Mistress!" ||23||
With their heads bowed, hands folded, and hearts filled with reverence, the beautiful people, who were always by Sita's side, eagerly awaited her commands. Their wishes were always fulfilled. ||24||
Sita, the daughter of Janaka, resided there, her mind filled with thoughts of Dharma and Rama. She constantly engaged in discussions about Dharma and Rama. ||25||
The king, Vrajjangha, gave Sita all the gifts he received from his vassals and from the morning offerings. Sita used these gifts to perform acts of Dharma. ||26||
The commander-in-chief, whose face was like that of Yama, was filled with sorrow and distress. He was exhausted from his arduous duties. ||27||

The messenger of Yama, whose army was exhausted and who was surrounded by kings eager to hasten, went to Ramadeva with his head bowed. ||27-28||
And said, "O Lord! O King! At your command, I left Sita in the terrible forest, she who was only a companion to me in her pregnancy." ||26||
"O Lord! At your command, I left Sita in that forest which is served by groups of various kinds of extremely terrifying wild animals that make terrible sounds, where there is dense darkness caused by groups of trees that take the form of Vetalas, where there are many tigers and wild buffaloes who are constantly engaged in battle out of natural hatred, where the sound of drums constantly resounds from the wind striking the hollows, where the roar of lions echoes within the caves, where the sound of sleeping pythons is as terrifying as the sound of a crow walking on wood, where thirsty wolves have destroyed the hanging fetuses of deer, where lions who fear blood lick the clusters of the Dhataki tree, and which is skilled in producing a group of fears even for Yama." ||30-34||
"O Lord! I tell you the message of Sita, whose face is raining tears like a day of misfortune and who is burning with great sorrow." ||35||
"Sita Devi has told you that if you want her well-being, then you should not abandon your devotion to the Jina, just as you have abandoned me." ||36||
"A king who is attached to affection and love and who can abandon me, can certainly abandon devotion to the Jina." ||37||
"A wicked man who is strong in words speaks slander without thinking about it, but a wise man should consider it." ||38||
"Ordinary people do not speak of my faults in the same way that people who are devoid of right knowledge speak of the faults of the jewel of true Dharma." ||39||
"What fault is there in my being abandoned in a terrible, desolate forest? O Rama, you should not abandon the purity of right vision." ||40||

The army was constantly exhausted
and was being surrounded by kings who were eager to hasten, so the messenger of Yama, with his head bowed, went to Ramadeva. ||27-28||

1. She who was only a companion to me in her pregnancy. 2. The sound of a crow walking on wood. 3. Sleeping pythons. 4. Thirsty wolves.

Padma Purana
This one birth is painful for you, separated from me. But losing right faith will cause you pain birth after birth. ||41||
For a human, treasures, women, and vehicles are easy to obtain in this world. But the jewel of right faith is more difficult to obtain than even an empire. ||42||
If you commit sins in the kingdom, your fall into hell is certain. But if right faith is with you, you will ascend to heaven by its power alone. ||43||
He whose soul is adorned with the jewel of right faith, attains fulfillment in both worlds. ||44||
Hearing this message from Sita, whose heart is filled with love, whose mind is firm, whose spirit is unwavering, what noble man would not be inspired? ||45||
Those who are naturally timid, become even more fearful when faced with other fears. But even men are terrified by fierce and terrible horrors. The meaning is that the terrible horrors that Sita, who is naturally timid, faces, are not faced by men. ||46||
Oh God! Where there are groups of extremely bright, wicked, and violent creatures that terrify even Yama, where elephants trapped in the mud of a half-dry pond are roaring, where groups of cows are suffering, their tails entangled in thorny bushes, where groups of deer are running frantically, believing in the mirage of water, where monkeys are extremely restless, their bodies covered in dust from the dust of the wind, where bears are roaring, their faces covered with long, tangled hair, where groups of wolves, thirsty and suffering, are sticking out their tongues like leaves, where snakes are enraged by the cracking of gumchi pods and the falling of their seeds, where creatures seeking shelter in trees are crying out in fear that the trees might break and fall on them due to the strong wind, where dust and leaves are flying up in the air, created by a sudden gust of wind, where many trees are broken by the movement of large pythons, where terrible creatures are destroyed by the enraged, intoxicated elephants, where the ground is hard, in the middle of ponds dug by groups of boars, where the ground is covered with thorns, pebbles, thorny bushes, and mounds of earth, where the juice of flowers is flowing,

Alas, Sita, your eyes are like three-colored lotuses, you are an ocean of pure virtues, you have conquered the moon with your face, you are as delicate as the inner part of a lotus. 

Oh, Vaidehi! Oh, Vaidehi! Speak quickly. You know that my heart is extremely distressed without you. 

You are the possessor of unparalleled character, beautiful, your conversation is beneficial and pleasing. Your mind is free from sin. 

You were free from any offense, yet I, being merciless, left you. Oh, you who dwell in my heart! What state have you reached? 

Oh, Devi! How will you stay in this forest, full of fearsome and wicked wild animals, deprived of pleasures? 

Your eyes are like intoxicated chakoras, you are a reservoir of beauty, endowed with modesty and humility. Alas, my Devi! Where have you gone? 

Alas, Devi! The bees, attracted by the fragrance of your breath, will gather near your face and hum. You will surely be distressed, driving them away with your lotus hands. 

Like a deer separated from its herd, you will go where in this terrifying forest, which is unbearable even to think about? 

Your feet are soft like the inner part of a lotus, and your features are beautiful. How will your delicate feet bear the rough ground? 

Page #248:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
How will your feet endure the harshness of the earth? ||68||
Or, perhaps, those Mlechchas, whose minds are devoid of the knowledge of right and wrong, have captured you and taken you to a terrible place. ||66||
My dear, my virtuous one, I have left you in the forest, so this time you have experienced a sorrow greater than any you have known before. ||70||
Or, perhaps, you are sleeping in the dense darkness of night, filled with sorrow and covered in the dust of the forest, and an elephant has crushed you. ||71||
How can you endure the pain in this dense forest, filled with vultures, bears, jackals, rabbits, and owls, where there is no visible path? ||72||
Or, my dear, have you been taken to a place where you cannot speak, by a tiger whose mouth is terrifying with fangs, whose body trembles with yawning, and who is consumed by intense hunger? ||73||
Or, perhaps, you have been taken to a place beyond words by a lion whose tongue is flickering and whose mane is beautiful, for who is not powerful in matters of women? ||74||
Or, Goddess, have you been taken to a place of disgrace by a fire, filled with flames and lacking tall trees? ||75||
Or, perhaps, you were unable to seek shade, and so you have been consumed by the unbearable rays of the sun. ||76||
Or, perhaps, your heart has been broken by the uncertainty of it all, because you were a woman of noble character and I was a cruel one, yet you still placed your heart in me. And so, you have met your death. ||77||
Who now, like Hanuman and Ratnajaati, will bring news of Sita's well-being? ||78||
Alas, my dear, alas, you of great virtue, alas, you of a gentle heart, alas, you of good fortune! Where are you? Where have you gone? What are you doing? Do you know nothing? ||79||
Oh, you with the face of death, did you truly leave your beloved in this terrible forest? No, no, how could you do such a thing? ||80||
Tell me, tell me, did you not leave her? Speak, like the moon showering nectar from its mouth. ||81||
Thus spoken to, the general, whose face was heavy with shame, whose radiance had faded, and who was devoid of acceptance, said... ||82||

## The Ninety-ninth Chapter

23,

While meditating on Sita, who was in great distress, Rama fainted again and was brought back to consciousness with great difficulty. ||3||

In the meantime, Lakshmana arrived and, touching Rama, who was filled with sorrow, said, "O Lord, why are you so distressed? Be patient." ||8||

This is the fruit of past karma, which has come to all beings, not just the royal lady. ||5||

Whatever sorrow or happiness one has to experience in this world, one receives it by oneself, without any external cause. ||6||

Even if a being is taken to the sky, or to a forest filled with wild animals, or to the top of a mountain, it is protected by its own merit. ||7||

O Lord, upon hearing the news of Sita's abandonment, even the most ordinary people in this land of Bharata felt sorrow in their hearts. ||8||

The people, tormented by sorrow and melting away on all sides, their hearts were breaking, as if they were pouring out tears. ||8||

Saying this, Lakshmana, deeply distressed, began to lament, his face as pale as a lotus petal struck by frost. ||10||

Alas, Sita! Your body is burning with the fire of the words of wicked people. You are the earth that gives birth to the grain of virtue, and you are filled with noble thoughts. ||11||

O Princess! Where have you gone? Your lotus feet were so delicate. You were the earth that supported the mountain of virtue. O Sita! You were so gentle and kind. ||12||

O Mother! See, the lotus, adorned with virtue and served by royal swans, is scorched on all sides by the snow of the words of wicked men. ||13||

O Excellent One! You were as virtuous as Subhadra, skilled in all conduct, and you were the embodiment of happiness for all beings. Where have you gone? ||14||

What is the sky without the sun, and what is the night without the moon? Similarly, what is Ayodhya without that jewel of a woman? ||15||

The commander-in-chief was distraught. ||2||

When the grim reaper stood silent, Rama, filled with immense sorrow, meditating on Sita, fainted again and was brought back to consciousness with great difficulty. ||3||

##  Chapter 212 of the Padma Purana

**Verse 16:** The city is devoid of the sounds of flutes, veenas, and mridangas, filled only with the cries of sorrow.

**Verse 17:** In the streets, gardens, forests, rivers, crossroads, palaces, and markets, continuous streams of tears flow, creating a mud like that of the rainy season.

**Verse 18:** With voices choked with sobs, the people, with great difficulty, praise Janaki, even though she is no longer present, showering her with the flowers of their virtues.

**Verse 19:** The entire world, with their minds fixed on her alone, worships her, for she, radiant with virtues, has become the pinnacle of all virtuous women.

**Verse 101:** Even the birds, like the shuka, who were nurtured by Sita herself, are overwhelmed with grief and sorrow, their bodies trembling, their cries echoing in the air.

**Verse 102:** For whom, whose heart was connected to her virtues, is there no great sorrow for Janaki?

**Verse 103:** But, wise one, regret is not a remedy for what has been done. Therefore, you should strive to maintain your composure.

**Verse 104:** Thus, encouraged by Lakshmana's words, Rama, having somewhat relinquished his grief, focused his mind on the task at hand.

**Verse 105:** He instructed the people, including Bhadra, about the funeral rites for Janaki, and summoned Bhadrakalasha, the treasurer, saying, "Bhadra, give the donation to her, following the same method she had instructed you before."

**Verse 106:** "As you command," said the treasurer, with a pure heart, and for nine months, he continued to provide the desired donations to the needy.

**Verse 107:** Even though eight thousand women constantly served him, Rama never for a moment forgot Sita in his heart.

**Verse 108:** His speech was always filled with the name of Sita, and his mind, captivated by her virtues, saw her everywhere.

**Verse 109:** In his dreams, he saw Janaki, her body covered in dust, dwelling in a cave in the mountains, her eyes constantly shedding tears.

**Verse 110:** Just as the night has no beauty without the moon, Ayodhya has no beauty without Sita.

With a heart filled with sorrow, Rama, his eyes filled with tears, thought with a sigh, "Alas! It is a great hardship that Sita, with her beautiful demeanor, even though she is in another world, does not leave me. She, being a virtuous woman, with her past good deeds, is still intent on my welfare." 111-112
Then, gradually, as Sita's sorrow subsided, Rama regained his composure with the remaining women. 113
Rama and Lakshmana, who were endowed with the divine weapons called Hal and Chakra, who were righteous, filled with unwavering love, and oceans of noble qualities, and who ruled the earth from the Himalayas to the southern seas, shone brightly like the gods of the heavens. 114-115
Gautama Swami says to King Shrenik, "O King! In that Ayodhya, where men were like gods, those two best of men, Rama and Lakshmana, with their excellent radiance, attained supreme enjoyments like the Indras." 116
"Their character, which was the result of their good deeds and which brought joy to all beings, and who were radiant like the sun, remained immersed in the ocean of happiness for an unknown period of time." 117
Thus ends the Ninety-Ninth Chapter, called "Rama's Sorrow," in the Padma Purana, composed by the Acharya, known as Rishi Ravishena. 66

Thus, this story has been told. Now, listen, O King, to another story related to the salt-goad. 

1.  The slender body of Janaka's daughter, Sita, took on a whiteness as if it had been embraced by the pure merit of all beings. 
2.  The beautiful, pointed tips of her breasts were adorned with a dark hue, as if they were sealed jars of milk, ready for her son to drink.
3.  Her gaze, soft and white, held an extreme sweetness, as if a long, wide river of milk had been placed on her face for nourishment.
4.  Her body was adorned with a multitude of auspicious signs, as if it were meant to reveal the glory of infinite and vast blessings.
5.  As Sita gently placed her feet on the pure, gem-studded floor, her reflection fell below, as if the earth, in the form of a lotus, were serving her.
6.  The image of the doll, which is desired during childbirth, was placed near Sita's bed, and its reflection fell on her cheek, making it appear like Lakshmi herself.
7.  At night, when Sita went to the roof of the palace, the reflection of the moon fell on her uncovered breasts, as if a white umbrella had been placed over her womb.
8.  Even when she slept in her dwelling, women with agile arms, holding various fly whisks, continued to wave them over her.
9.  In her dreams, large elephants, adorned with ornaments, performed an auspicious ablution over her with water kept in lotus leaf cups.
10.  When she awoke, the sound of "Victory, Victory" echoed repeatedly, as if the beautiful dolls placed in the upper part of the palace were chanting it.
11.  When she called out to her family, they responded with "Your command, O Queen," their voices soft and ethereal, as if they were disembodied.

The lady of noble mind did not tolerate even a slight transgression of an order, even in playful activities, and she would furrow her brows in confusion even in tasks done with great speed. ||13|| Although mirrors with desired gems were present nearby, she developed a habit of looking at the edge of a drawn sword. ||14|| She disliked the sound of the bow, which was not pleasing to women, and had the string removed from the veena. ||15|| Her eyes found great delight in caged lions, and her head bowed only with great difficulty, as if it were fixed in place. ||16||
When the ninth month was complete, and the moon was in the Shravana constellation, on the full moon day of the Shravana month, the auspicious Sita, adorned with all auspicious signs and with a face like the full moon, gave birth to two sons, bringing joy and happiness. ||17-18||
At their birth, the people became like dancers, and the sounds of conch shells, drums, and cymbals filled the air. ||19|| The king, filled with joy, celebrated a grand festival, like that of the mad people of the world, and it was filled with beautiful wealth. ||20|| One of the sons was adorned with the name Anangalavana, and the other, with a meaningful purpose, was adorned with the name Madanankusha. ||21||
Then, those two boys, the sprouts of a valiant man, grew up, bringing joy to their mother's heart. ||22|| Mustard seeds were placed on their heads for protection, and they shone like sparks of blazing fire, symbolizing their prowess. ||23|| Their bodies, tinged with the yellow of saffron, seemed to be enveloped in their natural brilliance, which was becoming increasingly evident. ||24|| The rows of large, tiger-like claws, set in gold, adorned their hearts like a cluster of budding shoots. ||25|| Their first, unspoken words, captivating the minds of all, seemed like the truth of their birth, signifying that their birth was a holy day. ||26|| Their charming smiles, like flowers, attracted the hearts of people, like bees attracted to honey. ||27||
The words began to be uttered spontaneously. ||12|| 

Page #254:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
Their innocent and charming smiles captivated hearts everywhere. ||27||
Just like the playful laughter that arose from being fed milk by their mother, their small teeth adorned their lotus-like face. ||28||
Holding onto their mother's fingers, they took five or six steps, captivating everyone's hearts. ||26||
Seeing her sons engaged in such beautiful play, mother Sita forgot all her sorrows. ||30||
Growing up and naturally radiating a charming aura, both of them reached the stage of their bodies suitable for acquiring knowledge. ||31||
Then, due to their virtuous karma, a renowned pure-souled Ksullaka named Siddhartha arrived at the palace of King Vanajan. ||32||
This Ksullaka was so powerful in his mastery of the great knowledge that he would worship the Jina statues on Mount Meru every day during all three sandhyas and return to his place in an instant. ||33||
He had a peaceful face, was a brave and wise soul, his head was adorned with loose curls, his mind was filled with pure thoughts, he possessed only a single garment, he was a follower of the great Anuvrata, he was adorned with various virtues, he was a knower of the secrets of the Jina teachings, and he was a master of the ocean of arts. ||34||
Wearing a white, flowing garment, he seemed like a majestic elephant adorned with a garland of lotus stems, moving slowly, carrying his staff like a beloved companion, and uttering the pleasing word "Dharmavruddhi" like the taste of nectar. ||36||
He wandered from house to house, collecting alms, and by chance, he reached the noble house where Sita resided. ||38||
Sita, who possessed a charming disposition like that of a goddess of the Jina teachings, was overwhelmed with joy upon seeing the Ksullaka and descended from her nine-storied palace. ||36||
Approaching him, she joined her hands in reverence and worshipped him properly with offerings of flowers and incense. ||40||
Being a master of the scriptures, she offered him special food and drink with respect, for she considered those devoted to the Jina teachings as her own kin. ||41||
After his meal, he was free from any further duties and remained comfortably. ||42||

His mind, subdued by the practice of great courtesy and humility, the Kṣullaka, with a contented heart, saw Lavaṇāṅkuśa. ||43||

The Kṣullaka, knowing the eight auspicious signs, heard from the Śrāvikā, who had taken the vows, about her sons. He did not ask her to speak about them, as if they were ordinary children. ||44||

Having heard the story, the Śrāvikā, with tears streaming from her eyes, was overcome with grief for a moment. The Kṣullaka was also saddened. ||45||

He said, "O Devi! You should not grieve, for these two boys are like the sons of the gods." ||46||

Then, with his heart filled with great love, the Kṣullaka, in a short time, taught Lavaṇāṅkuśa the art of weaponry and scriptures. ||47||

In a short time, those sons became endowed with knowledge and wisdom, experts in arts and virtues, and very skilled in the art of summoning and dismissing divine weapons. ||48||

By the power of their great merit, they, whose coverings had been destroyed, were holding the supreme Lakshmi, like treasure pots. ||49||

For a teacher, there is no sorrow in a disciple who is endowed with power, because all things are easily shown to a man with eyes by the sun. ||50||

It is right that those who have a previous acquaintance should obtain virtues easily, for what sorrow is there for swans who descend into the lake of the mind? That is, there is none. ||51||

A teacher who gives instruction to a worthy recipient attains his purpose. For just as the light of the sun is useless to an owl, so too is the instruction of a teacher useless to an unworthy recipient. ||52||

Then, with their increasing fame and glory, which had enveloped the world, those two sons became beautiful and difficult to look at, like the moon and the sun. That is, they were as beautiful as the moon, and it was difficult to look at them, as if they were the sun. ||53||

With their manifest brilliance and strength, they, united together, seemed like fire and wind, or, with their shoulders as firm as stone, they appeared like the Himalayas and the Vindhyas. ||54||

Or, they were worthy of wearing a beautiful garland, like the union of the two ages. They were pleasing and beneficial, like the abode of Dharma. ||55||

The Kṣullaka, relieved, sat down comfortably. Then, when asked, he told the story of his travels and other matters to Sītā. ||42||

---------------------------
The two were like the Puranas, they were considered as the east and west directions by the people. They were capable of the rise and fall of all the luminous ones. ||56|| The vast earth, surrounded by the nearby ocean, appeared to them like a small hut. And in this earth-shaped hut, if their shadow also turned away from the light, they would also condemn it. ||57|| They were ashamed even by the reflection in the toenail and they were greatly distressed even by the breaking of the hair. ||58|| They were ashamed even by the umbrella reflected in the jewel on the crown and they were irritated even by the reflection of a man in the mirror. ||59|| They were angered even by the bow held by the clouds and they were grieved even by the kings who did not bow down to them. ||60|| They looked at the sun, which was content with its own vast brilliance, with disdain, if there was any obstruction in its light. ||61|| They would break even the strong wind, whose form was not visible, and their anger would flare up even on the Himalayas, which were adorned with the hair of the yak. ||62|| Their minds were saddened even by the conch shells that were falling in the oceans and they could not tolerate even Varuna, the lord of the oceans. ||63|| They would make even the kings with umbrellas shadowless, that is, devoid of radiance, and they would speak sweet words to them, being pleased by the service of good men. ||64|| They were causing distress to the lineage of wicked kings who were far away, that is, they were harming even the wicked kings who were far away, let alone the ones who were nearby. ||65|| Their palms had turned black due to constantly holding weapons, which made it seem as if they had turned black from extinguishing the fire of the prowess of the rest of the kings. ||66|| The deep sound of the bow, which was produced during practice, made it seem as if they were conversing with all the women who were in the form of directions. ||67|| "Just as there is salt, so there is a goad," thus, the two were auspicious, with their words blooming and appearing. ||68|| 
(They were skilled in establishing the best order in the age) They were like the great bulls, or they were like the ashramas, beautiful and holding happiness. ||55||

## Chapter One Hundred

Two youths, adorned with the splendor of youth and possessing the most beautiful demeanor, have attained fame on earth, like salt and a goad. ||66|| They are worthy of being celebrated by all, and they arouse the curiosity of everyone. Their very being is shaped by virtue, and their sight brings happiness to all. ||70|| For the blossoming of young women, they are like the full moon of autumn, and for the joy of Sita's heart, they are like the moving Mount Meru. ||71|| They are like the sun among other princes, their eyes are like white lotuses. They are like the gods called Dvipa Kumaras, and their chests are adorned with the Srivatsa mark. ||72|| They are the foundation of infinite valor, standing on the shore of the ocean of existence, bound together by the strong bond of mutual love. ||73|| Though they are on the path of righteousness, they are captivating and charming. Even with their qualities being countless, they are free from any crookedness or deceit. ||74|| They have conquered the sun with their brilliance, the moon with their radiance, Indra with their power, the ocean with their depth, Mount Meru with their steadfastness, the earth with their virtue of forgiveness, Jayakumar with their valor, and Hanuman with their speed. ||75-76|| They can catch even a released arrow with their speed, and they play in the vast waters with crocodiles and other aquatic creatures. ||77|| Even after fighting with enraged elephants, they do not experience fatigue, and their radiance is so powerful that even the rays of the sun seem to scatter in fear. ||78|| They are like the virtuous in terms of righteousness, like the sun in terms of fortitude, like the mountain in terms of right vision, and like Sri Vijay Balabhadra in terms of charity. ||79|| They are like Ayodhya in terms of pride, like Madhukaitabha in terms of courage, and like Indrajit and Meghavahana in terms of their prowess in great battles. ||80|| They are devoted to serving their teachers, they are absorbed in the stories of the Jina, and even the mere sound of their names instills fear in their enemies. ||81||

## The Kaadhik Shatam Parva

Then, seeing the two handsome princes fit for marriage, Vajrajangha resolved to find a bride for them. ||1|| He decided to give his daughter, Shashichula, born to Lakshmi Devi, along with thirty-two other girls, to Lavana. ||2|| The king wanted to witness the auspicious wedding ceremonies of both his sons simultaneously. Therefore, he searched everywhere for a suitable bride for his second son. ||3|| Not finding a suitable bride, he felt dejected, as if he had been deprived of something precious. Suddenly, he remembered something and felt as if he had achieved his goal. ||4|| He remembered that the king of Prithvi Nagar had a pure and noble daughter named Kanakmala, born to his queen Amritavati. ||5|| She was like the line of the moon, captivating everyone, victorious over Lakshmi, and a lotus without a lotus, a paradox. ||6|| She was similar to Shashichula and auspicious. ||7|| Thinking thus, the king sent a messenger to Prithvi Nagar for this purpose. ||8|| The wise messenger reached Prithvi Nagar and, after being honored, spoke to King Prithu. ||9|| As soon as King Prithu saw the messenger with pure vision, before the messenger could utter a word about the request for his daughter, he said, "O messenger! You are not at fault, for you are subservient and a mere translator of others' words." ||10|| "Those who are devoid of inner warmth and self-respect, whose souls are fickle, and who are filled with many insults, are like the flow of water, carried wherever they are desired. You are one of them." ||11|| "Even though this is all true, you have uttered sinful words, and therefore, you deserve punishment. For, what destructive instrument, driven by another, is not destroyed?" ||12|| "O messenger! I know you are like dust, incapable of doing anything. Therefore, I have honored you by simply dismissing you." ||13|| 

Page #260:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, it is said that lineage, character, wealth, beauty, equality, strength, age, country, and knowledge are the qualities of a good husband. However, among all these qualities, lineage is considered the most important. The other qualities are desirable but not essential. 

Therefore, how can a daughter, who is considered honorable, be given to a man who lacks this primary quality of lineage? 

To the one who spoke so shamelessly and against reason, it is not appropriate to give a daughter, but I will give you a "daughter" (meaning a bad death). 

The messenger, who was completely ignored, returned to Vajrajangha and reported the situation. 

Then, Vajrajangha himself went halfway to Prithu's kingdom and, through a messenger, requested Prithu's daughter again. 

Despite showing respect to Prithu, Vajrajangha was unable to obtain his daughter. Enraged, he decided to destroy Prithu's kingdom. 

The king of Prithu's kingdom, named Vyagraratha, was the protector of the kingdom's borders. He was defeated by Vajrajangha in battle and imprisoned. 

Knowing that Vyagraratha, a powerful king, was imprisoned and that Vajrajangha was about to destroy his kingdom, Prithu sought help from his friend, the king of Podana, who had a large army. 

Vajrajangha, in turn, sent a messenger with a letter to his sons in Paundarika-pura, urging them to come quickly. 

Upon hearing their father's command, the princes immediately prepared for war, sounding the drums and conch shells. 

A great commotion, like a roaring ocean, arose in Paundarika-pura. 

Hearing this unprecedented sound of war preparations, Lavana and Angkusha asked the people around them, "What is this?" 

Upon learning that this was all happening because of them, the two sons of Sita, eager for battle, prepared to leave. 

Page #261:

##  The Hundred and More Chapters

The two, who were filled with eagerness and could not bear even a moment of defeat, whose great brilliance was manifest, did not even tolerate the delay of their vehicle. ||26|| The sons of the forest-dweller, the entire inner palace, and all the retinue, tried to stop them, but they disregarded their words. Then, Janaki, whose heart was melting with love for her sons, seeing them ready for battle, said, "O children! This is not the right time for you to fight. For calves are not put in front of the chariot's axle." ||30-32|| In response, the two sons said, "Mother! Why did you say that? What need is there for the old in this? The earth is for the enjoyment of heroes." ||33|| "What is the use of a large body for a fire that burns? It is its nature that is the cause of its greatness." ||34|| Seeing her sons speak thus, Janaki's eyes, filled with mixed emotions, shed a few tears. ||35|| 

After bathing and taking food, they adorned themselves with ornaments and, with body, mind, and speech, bowed respectfully to the perfected ones. ||36|| After paying homage to Savitri and all the learned in the scriptures, they left their home, accompanied by auspicious omens. ||37|| Then, mounting their chariots, drawn by swift steeds, and equipped with various weapons, they set out for the earth. ||38|| Possessing a vast army and considering the bow as their only companion, the two princes seemed to be embodiments of effort and valor. ||39|| With hearts full of generosity and great enthusiasm for battle, these two, bearers of great fortune, reached Vajrajab in six days. ||40|| 

Hearing of the enemy's army, which was full of effort, and was close at hand, King Prithu, who was surrounded by a vast army, emerged from his city of Prithvi. ||41|| His brothers, friends, sons, maternal uncles, and maternal cousins, along with others who were devoted to him, all set out. ||42||

Padmapurana
Suja, Anga, Vanga, Magadha, etc., kings of the earth, all with great strength, set out. ||43||
They were surrounded by chariots, horses, elephants, and foot soldiers, all enraged and ready to fight. ||44||
Hearing the sound of the trumpets from the chariots, elephants, and horses, the Vrajangha chiefs, ready for battle, were also eager to fight. ||45||
Then, when the front lines of both armies came very close, Lavana and Angkusha, filled with great enthusiasm, entered the enemy's army. ||46||
These two princes, moving with great speed, like a great fire, began to play in the great lake of the enemy army. ||47||
Like lightning, they appeared here and there, then disappeared. They were so powerful that the enemy could hardly look at them. ||48||
They were seen taking arrows, stringing them, and releasing them, but they were not seen, only the slain enemies were seen. ||49||
The earth was covered with fallen chariots, wounded by sharp arrows, making it very difficult to traverse. ||50||
The enemy army, like madmen, was defeated in the blink of an eye, and the group of elephants ran here and there, as if frightened by a lion. ||51||
Then, in a moment, the army of King Prithu, like a river, was dried up by the rays of the sun, which were like the arrows of Lavana and Angkusha. ||52||
The remaining warriors, terrified, fled in all directions, like a group of cotton flowers, without the desire of those princes. ||53||
Prithu, helpless and dejected, was on the path of defeat, and the princes, with their bows, pursued him and said, "Oh, vile Naraprith, where are you fleeing now? We two, whose lineage and character are unknown, have come." ||54-55||
"Why are you not ashamed to flee from us, whose lineage and character are unknown?" ||56||
"Now, we will show you our lineage and character with our arrows. Be careful, or you will be forced to stay." ||57||

Having said this, Pṛthu, with folded hands, bowed down and said, "O heroes! May you forgive my ignorance-born fault." ||5||
"Your greatness has not come within the reach of my mind, just as the sun's rays do not reach the lotus." ||56||
"It is only for the wise that the introduction of their lineage and character is appropriate. It is not appropriate for the Bharatyas, for it is fraught with doubt." ||60||
"Who is the fool who does not know the power of fire to burn the forest, just by seeing it burn?" ||61||
"You two are the supreme heroes, born of a great lineage, and you are our masters, bringing us happiness." ||62||
Thus praised, the two princes bowed their heads, their anger completely subsided, and their faces were calm. ||63||
Then, when the kings, headed by Vajrajāṅgha, arrived, there was a friendship between the two heroes and Pṛthu, in the presence of all. ||64||
"It is true that noble-minded people are pleased by mere salutations, for the flow of rivers does not uproot the humble Vetasa plants." ||65||
Then, Pṛthu, with great pomp, brought the two heroes, who brought joy to all, into the city. ||66||
There, Pṛthu decided to give his daughter Kanakamalā, adorned with great wealth, to the hero Madanāṅkaśa. ||67||
Then, the two heroes, skilled in action, spent one night there and set out from the city to conquer this entire earth. ||68||
Surrounded by the kings of Suhma, Anga, Magadha, Vanga, and Podanapura, the two princes were ready to go to Lokākṣanagara. ||69||
With a large army, the two heroes, happily attacking the many countries connected to it, reached near Lokākṣanagara. ||70||
Just as the wings of Garuda disturb the serpent, so did they disturb the king Kubera-kanta, who was proud there. ||71||
"Give it, be careful to stand up, or you will be forced to stand up." ||57|| 

Page #264:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
In the midst of the four-armed army, in the great battlefield, Bhima, the greatest of warriors, conquered Kubera-kanta and advanced, his army growing stronger. ||72||
From there, they went to the Lampaka country, surrounded by thousands of kings who had submitted to their rule. It was difficult to travel by land, so they had to travel by boat. ||73||
There, they defeated the king Ekakarna and, due to the favorable route, both princes went to the place of victory. ||74||
There, they conquered a hundred brothers by merely looking at them, crossed the Ganges, and went north towards Kailasa. ||75||
There, they met with the beautiful countries of Nandana, and were honored by the best of men with various offerings in their hands. ||76||
They subdued the kings of Bhaskuntala, Kalamba, Nandi, Nandana, Sinhala, Shalabha, Anala, Chaula, Bhima, and Bhutarava, and went to the other side of the Sindhu. They also subdued the kings who lived on the other side of the western ocean. ||77-78||
O Shrenika, I will tell you about some of the rulers of Purkheta, Matamba, and other countries who were subdued by the two princes. ||79||
Some of these countries were Aryan, some were Mleccha, and some were of both types, with different customs. ||80||
The rulers of the following countries were conquered: Bhira, Yavana, Kacha, Ashva, Trijata, Nata, Shaka, Kerala, Nepal, Malava, Arul, Sharvara, Vrisha, Vaidya, Kashmir, Hidimba, Avashta, Varvara, Trishira, Parashala, Gaushil, Ushinar, Suryarak, Sanarta, Khasha, Vindhya, Shikhapad, Mekhala, Shurasen, Vahlika, Ullu, Kosala, Dari, Gandhara, Sauvira, Puri, Kaubera, Kohara, Andhra, Kala, and Kalinga. They had different languages, different qualities, different types of jewels and clothes, different types of trees, different types of mines, and were all adorned with gold and other wealth. ||81-86||
The people of these various countries, with their great wealth and devotion, followed the wishes of Lavana and Angusha, and wandered the earth. ||87||

Those two most excellent men, making the earth happy, were situated above thousands of great kings. ||8|| Protecting the countries properly, engaged in various beautiful stories, those two excellent men, having set out from Paundarika-pura, ||86|| having received great worship from the rulers of the countries, approached Paundarika-pura. ||30|| Then, having taken refuge in the seventh floor of the palace, surrounded by excellent women, enjoying comfortable seats, ||11|| Sita saw the dust rising like a swift, cloudy, gray cloud, and asked her friends, ||12|| "What is this that is seen, friends, this fickle, invading direction?" They said, "O Queen, this must be the dust of the army." ||13|| "Indeed, see, in the middle of this, clear water is known, like a group of crocodiles swimming, or a group of horses." ||14|| "Surely, O Lord, these two princes have arrived, having accomplished their purpose. Indeed, those two, the best of the world, are seen." ||15|| Thus, the story was going on, while Sita's mind was beautiful, when the messengers, bringing good news, arrived. ||16|| Then, the whole city was adorned, by people filled with respect, bearing the highest joy. ||17|| Pure flags were raised on the tops of the ramparts, the roads were made beautiful with divine arches. ||18|| The royal road was filled with fragrant flowers, adorned with beautiful garlands, step by step. ||19|| Pots with leaves were placed at the gates, and the market streets were adorned with silk garments, etc. ||20|| It seemed as if the Vidyadharas, the gods, or Lakshmi herself had created it, Paundarika-pura became like Ayodhya. ||21|| Seeing those two princes entering with great splendor, the behavior of the women of the city was indescribable. ||22||
1. The whole city was adorned. ||
2. With silk garments, etc. ||

Padma Purana
Seeing her sons, who had achieved their purpose, approaching her, Sita was as if submerged in the ocean of nectar. ||103||
The two heroes, who had folded their hands like lotus buds, who were full of respect, who had bowed their heads, and who were covered in the dust of the army, approached their mother with great reverence. ||104||
Sita, who was inclined to show affection for her sons, who was delighted by the lotus-like hands of her sons, embraced them, touched their heads with her hands, and was filled with supreme joy. ||105||
They then repeatedly accepted the supreme grace bestowed upon them by their mother, and like the sun and moon, they continued to perform their duties in the world, living happily as they should. ||106||
Thus ends the one hundred and first chapter of the Sri Padma Purana, known as the Arsha, composed by the Acharya Sri Ravishena, which narrates the conquest of the directions by Lavana and Angush. ||11||

1.  The two men, having attained supreme sovereignty, were the best of men, standing and giving orders to the exalted kings.
2.  Then Narada, with a face like the end of time, asked about the whereabouts of Janaki, searching for her, sorrowful.
3.  Seeing the two heroes, he was honored by them, being given a seat and treated like a householder-sage.
4.  Then, sitting comfortably, carrying supreme joy, and looking at them with affection, Narada spoke.
5.  May the fortune of Rama and Lakshmana, the lords of men, be yours, in every way, soon.
6.  Then they asked, "Who are those, O Lord, Rama and Lakshmana? What are their qualities and deeds, and from what lineage are they born?"
7.  Then Narada, with a face filled with wonder, spoke, standing still for a moment, waving his hand.
8.  A man can lift Mount Meru with his arms and swim across the ocean, but no one is capable of describing the qualities of these two.
9.  Even with infinite time and infinite tongues, the whole world is not capable of describing their qualities.
10.  My heart trembles with anxiety, seeing your curiosity, as I am overwhelmed by the task of answering your question about their qualities.
11.  Still, I will speak of some of their virtues, which are brief and increase merit, as you have asked.
12.  There was a king named Dasharatha, like the full moon in the sky of the Ikshvaku dynasty, and like fire for the fuel of evil deeds.
13.  He was of great brilliance, ruling over the land of Uttara Kosala, and illuminating the whole world like the sun.
14.  From the mountain king of men, like rivers of glory, they flowed and merged into the ocean, delighting the whole world.
15.  His four sons, capable of bearing the burden of the kingdom, were like good sons, endowed with virtues. 

Page #268:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
Rama, the eldest son, is described as being beautiful from all sides, and though he is a knower of all scriptures, he is also known throughout the world. ||16||
He, along with his younger brother Lakshmana and his wife Sita, the daughter of King Janaka, who was a devoted wife, protected the truth of his father, leaving Ayodhya desolate, and wandered the earth in disguise, eventually entering the Dandaka forest. ||17-18||
There, in a place that was difficult even for the great Vidyaadharas, they resided, and it was there that the story of Chandranakha occurred, meaning that Chandranakha displayed her feminine character. ||19||
Meanwhile, Rama went to the battlefield to learn about his younger brother, while the deceitful Ravana abducted Sita. ||20||
After that, the lords of Mahendra, Kishkindha, Shrishaila, and Malaya, as well as the chief monkey kings like Viradhit, who were endowed with great wealth and possessed great power in the form of knowledge, came to Rama's side, drawn by their love for his qualities or by their good fortune, and after defeating Ravana in battle, they brought Sita back. The Vidyaadharas made Ayodhya like a heavenly city. ||21-23||
Served by supreme wealth, the best of men, Rama and Lakshmana, enjoyed themselves there, facing each other, like the Nagendra (king of snakes). ||24||
Or, until now, why have you both not known Rama, whose younger brother is Lakshmana, who possesses the Sudarshana Chakra, which never goes in vain? ||25||
Besides this, he has other jewels, each of which is guarded by thousands of gods with single-minded devotion, and which are the cause of his kingship. ||26||
He who abandoned Sita for the sake of his people, who is there in this world who does not know Rama? ||27||
Or, let this world be, even in heaven, the groups of gods are filled with his qualities, and their minds are devoted to him. ||28||
Then, Ankusha said, "O sage! Tell me, for what reason did Rama abandon Sita? I wish to know." ||29||
Then, the sage Satavikṣaṇa, whose mind was attracted by Rama's qualities, narrated the entire story. ||30||

## The Two Hundred and Two Chapter

A woman of pure lineage, character, and heart, adorned with virtues, she is the leader of eight thousand women, extremely wise. ||31|| She has defeated Savitri, Gayatri, Sri, Kirti, Dhriti, and Devi with her purity, and is equal to the Jain scriptures. ||32|| Surely, due to the influence of the karmas accumulated in past lives, she was abandoned in a desolate forest, merely because of public opinion. ||33|| Having attained growth in happiness, that chaste woman, scorched by the harsh rays of the sun in the form of wicked people, has probably perished. ||34|| Delicate beings are prone to suffering even for the slightest reason, just as a garland of jasmine wilts at the mere touch of a lamp's light. ||35|| What then of Sita, who has never seen the sun, in a terrifying forest teeming with ferocious beasts? How can she survive? ||36|| The tongue of a wicked man, like a venomous serpent, contaminates innocent people. Why doesn't it cease from its evil ways? ||37|| Whoever criticizes a chaste woman like Sita, who is praiseworthy for her uprightness and purity, will suffer in this world and the next. ||38|| Or, for those who are always vigilant in destroying the karmas they have accumulated, what is there to criticize? In this matter, it is the world itself that deserves condemnation. ||39|| Having said this, the sage, overwhelmed with grief, could not speak further and resorted to the silence of yoga. ||40|| Then, Ankush, smiling, said, "O Brahman! By abandoning Sita in a terrifying forest, Rama did not act in a way befitting his lineage." ||41|| There are many ways to refute public opinion. Why then did he wound Sita in this way, while they were present? ||42|| Anangalavana, another prince, said, "O Muni! How far is Ayodhya from here?" In response, Narada, who loved to travel, said, "Ayodhya is sixty yojanas from here, where Rama, the beloved of the moon-like Priya, resides." ||43-44|| Hearing this, the two princes said, "We will go to them. What is the point of staying here? What is the importance of this earth, or of anyone else?" ||45||

Tears welled up in Narada's eyes as he finished the story. ||30|| 

Page #270:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
It was said to Vajrajangha, "O Mama! On this earth, all the kings like Suhma, Sindhu, Kalinga, etc., who are endowed with all resources, should be commanded to get ready to go to Ayodhya immediately, with all the things necessary for war." ||46-47||
"Let the great elephants, both those without pride and those with pride, be assembled. Let the horses, swift as the wind, with their mighty roar, be brought forth. Let the warriors, renowned for their valor and not fleeing from battle, be inspected. Let their excellent weapons be examined, and let their armor and other things be cleaned. Let the sound of trumpets mixed with the sound of conch shells be given, as a signal for the commencement of the great battle." ||48-50||
Thus commanded, the kings, who had come together with joy for the battle, with courage in their hearts and filled with great joy, stood firm, like the Indras who, having commanded the gods, are free from worry. ||51-52||
Then, hearing of the coronation of Padma Nabha, Sita, bearing great anxiety, wept. ||53||
Then, standing near Sita, Siddhartha said to Narada, "Why have you begun this unseemly act?" ||54||
"You, who are eager for battle and encourage war, have, by your own actions, caused this great division in the family." ||55||
Narada said, "I do not know this story. I only spoke to them about Rama and Lakshmana." ||56||
"Even if this has happened, do not fear. Nothing unseemly will happen. I know this. Let your mind be at ease." ||57||
Then, going near her, the two princes said to Sita, "Mother, why are you weeping? Tell us without delay." ||58||
"Who has done anything against you, or who has spoken against you? Whose life shall I take away today, whose heart is filled with evil?" ||59||
"Who is that man, without medicine in his hand, who plays with snakes? Who is that man, or god, who causes you sorrow?" ||60||
"Mother, for whose sake are you angry today, whose life is short? Mother, let your anger subside. Tell us the cause of your sorrow." ||61||

## Chapter Two Hundred and Two

Thus spoken, the goddess Sita, with tearful eyes, said, "I am not angry with anyone, O lotus-eyed sons."  ||2|| "I am grieving because I remember your father today.  I am weeping uncontrollably, my tears flowing like a river." ||63|| 

When she said this, the two valiant sons of the Shreniks thought, "Siddhartha is not our father." ||64|| Then they asked, "Mother, who is our father? Where is he?"  Asked thus, Sita, with a heavy heart, narrated her entire story. ||65|| She described her own birth, the birth of Rama, her journey to the forest, her abduction, and her return. ||66|| She recounted everything in detail, just as the divine sage Narada had narrated it.  For what is the point of concealing the story now? ||67|| 

Having said this, Sita said, "When you two were in my womb, your father abandoned me in the forest out of fear of public opinion." ||68|| "I was weeping in the forest called Sinharava when Vajrajangha, who had gone to capture elephants, saw me." ||69|| "This Vajrajangha, who had returned after capturing the elephant, was a great soul, a Shravaka, a pure gem of virtue, and compassionate. ||70|| He addressed me as his sister, brought me to his own place, and cared for me with great respect." ||71|| "It is in the magnificent house of this Vajrajangha, who is like your father, that I gave birth to you two, born from the body of Padmanabha." ||72|| "This entire earth, from the Himalayas to the ocean, is ruled by Rama, your elder brother, and he has made this earth his servant." ||73|| "Now, a great battle is about to take place between you and him.  What ill-omened news should I hear?  Should I hear about the misfortune of your father, or yours, or your brother-in-law?" ||74|| "It is this worry that has filled my heart with sorrow, and I am weeping.  What other reason could there be, my dear sons?" ||75|| 

Hearing this, Lavana and Angusha were overjoyed and surprised.  Their faces blossomed like lotuses.  They said, "Oh! That Sudhanva, the best of men, the glorious one, the one with vast and brilliant fame...

"Oh, that is our father, Sudhanva, the best of men. He is glorious, with vast fame, and has performed many great wonders." ||77||
"Mother, do not grieve over being abandoned in the forest. You will soon see the pride of Rama and Lakshmana shattered." ||78||
"My sons, do not oppose your father. It is not right to do so. Be calm." ||79||
"My dear sons, go with great humility and pay your respects to your father. This is the righteous path." ||80||
"Mother, how can we go and speak to him, saying, 'We are your sons,' when we have reached the place of our enemy?" ||81||
"It is better for us to die in the midst of battle than to harbor such a thought, which would be condemned by valiant men." ||82||
"Seeing Sita silent and her mind filled with sorrow, Lavana and Angusha performed the ablutions and other rituals." ||83||
"Then, having served the assembly of auspicious sages, having paid their respects to the perfected ones, and having comforted their mother and bowed to her, the two princes, adorned with auspicious garments, mounted two elephants, just as the moon and the sun mount the peaks of mountains. Then, they set out for Ayodhya, just as Rama and Lakshmana had set out for Lanka." ||84-85||
"Then, hearing the sound of preparations, knowing that they were leaving, thousands of warriors quickly marched out of Paundarika." ||86||
"There was a great clash between the kings, each showing off their armies, their minds filled with mutual rivalry." ||87||
"The two brothers, accompanied by a vast army that stretched for a yojana, protected the earth, adorned with various grains, their glorious prowess preceding them, and worshipped by the kings established in their respective lands." ||88-89||
"Ten thousand men, wielding large axes and shovels, marched ahead of them." ||90||
"They cut down trees and other things, creating a smooth, mirror-like earth, with hills and valleys." ||91||

First went the treasure-bearing buffaloes, camels, and large bulls. Then went the chariot attendants, making soft sounds.  After them went the groups of foot soldiers, leaping like young deer, and following them were groups of horses, performing excellent feats.  Then came the kings adorned with golden garlands, with large bells tied around their necks, making a sound, holding conch shells and whisks.  They were very proud, with their attire adorned with glass beads, mirrors, and torches.  Their white horses were adorned with iron, copper, and gold.  They were adorned with necklaces of jewels and pearls, and they looked like moving mountains, with various colored paintings.  Some had excessive intoxication flowing from their cheeks, some had closed eyes, some were filled with joy, some were about to become intoxicated, some were sharp with speed, and some were like clouds.  They were protected by men skilled in various weapons, making great sounds, and very bright.  They were knowledgeable about the sounds made by their own and enemy armies, and they were well-versed in all kinds of education, and they were elephants with beautiful movements.  After them went the horsemen, adorned with beautiful armor, with shields hung behind them, and spears in their hands.  The sky was filled with dust raised by the hooves of the horse groups, as if it were filled with groups of white clouds.  After them went the foot soldiers, covered in the darkness of weapons, performing various feats, arrogant, and with noble conduct.  In that vast army, no one was unhappy with beds, seats, betel nut, fragrance, garlands, beautiful clothes, food, and ointments, i.e., all these things were available to everyone.  Men appointed by the king's command were constantly present on the path, very efficient, always ready to act, and with good hearts.  They offered honey, sugar, ghee, water, and various other delicious things to everyone, with the utmost respect.  They were making the high and low ground level, like mirrors, all around.

There was no one in that army who was dirty, poor, hungry, thirsty, wearing shabby clothes, or worried. ||106|| In that ocean-like army, men and women adorned with various ornaments, dressed in fine clothes, and with beautiful complexions, were resplendent. ||107|| Thus, endowed with supreme glory, the two sons of Janaka reached the kingdom of Ayodhya, just as Indra reaches the abode of the gods. ||108|| The land there is adorned with the finest crops like barley, paddy, sugarcane, and wheat. ||109|| The rivers there are adorned with flocks of royal swans, the ponds with lotuses and water lilies, the mountains with various flowers, and the gardens with beautiful music. ||110|| The forests there are adorned with the sounds of large bulls, herds of beautiful cows and buffaloes, and cowherds sitting on platforms. ||111|| The villages situated on the borders are like cities, and the cities are like the city of Trivishtap. ||112|| Enjoying the objects of the five senses at will, Lavana-Angusha, endowed with supreme energy, went happily to that beloved land. ||113|| Due to the battle, the water flowing from the temples of the enraged elephants made all the dust on the path muddy. ||114|| The sharp hooves of the restless horses made the soft land of Kosala appear as if it were in a state of utter ruin. ||115|| Then, seeing the sky from afar, adorned with a group of evening clouds, Lavana-Angusha said, "Oh Mam! What is this that I see, with its bright red, vast radiance, rising so high?" Hearing this, Vajrajangha, after recognizing it for a long time, said, "Oh Deva! This is the excellent city of Ayodhya, whose golden walls are shining so brightly." ||116-118|| In this city, resides the glorious Balabhadra, who is your father, and Narayana and the virtuous Shatrughna, who are his brothers. ||119|| Thus, filled with stories of valor and courage, they happily went along, and a river flowed between them. ||120||
They continued to offer honey, delicious drinks, ghee, water, and various kinds of juicy food to everyone with great respect. ||104-105||

## Chapter Two Hundred and Two

**25.**

The river appeared between the two heroes, who were eager to capture the city, just as thirst arises for one who is about to attain liberation.  ||12||

The army, weary from the journey, was stationed near the river, like the great army of the gods near the river Nandana. ||122||

Hearing of the enemy army stationed nearby, Rama and Lakshmana were filled with wonder. ||123||

"Who is this mortal who desires death so quickly, approaching us under the pretext of war?" ||124||

Narayana immediately commanded Viradhit, the king, "Prepare the army for war without delay." ||125||

"Let the Vidhyadhara kings, bearing the banners of Vrupa, Naga, and Vanara, be informed of the impending battle." ||126||

"As you command," said Viradhit, the king of the birds, and summoning the kings, including Sugriva, he prepared for war. ||127||

Upon seeing the messenger, all the Vidhyadhara kings, with their vast armies, arrived in Ayodhya. ||128||

Meanwhile, Siddhartha and Narada, their hearts filled with anxiety, quickly informed Prabhammandala of the situation. ||129||

Hearing of Sita's plight, Prabhammandala, filled with paternal love, was overcome with sorrow. ||130||

Filled with grief, wonder, and joy, Prabhammandala, with his father, quickly boarded a celestial chariot, as swift as thought, and, accompanied by his entire army, set out for Paundarika-pura, his heart filled with love. ||131-132||

Seeing Prabhammandala, her father, and mother, Sita, whose grief was renewed, rose quickly and embraced them all, tears streaming down her face. She lamented, overwhelmed by the pain of her abandonment and other sorrows. ||133-134||

Prabhammandala, with great difficulty, comforted her, saying, "O Devi! Your sons have done well.

Because they had gone to those two, Halachakra Dharas, and disturbed them, they were heroes even among the gods, and they were not conquerable, the best of men. ||136|| As long as there is no carelessness in those two Kumaris, let us quickly go and think about protection. ||137|| Then, with her daughters-in-law, Sita, riding in a celestial chariot, went towards where her two sons, endowed with the strength of Vajra, had gone. ||138||
Then, Gautam Swami says, "O Shrenik! Who is capable of describing the full Lakshmi of Rama and Lakshmana? Therefore, listen to this brief description." ||139|| Surrounded by a vast ocean of chariots, horses, elephants, and foot soldiers, Rama and Lakshmana emerged, as if bearing anger. ||140|| Shatrughna, the powerful one, riding in a chariot drawn by horses, with his chest adorned with garlands, emerged, his mind set on war. ||141|| Just as the Harinakeshi god is the leader of the army, so too, Mani, with his face like that of Krtaanta, was the leader of all the armies. ||142|| His immeasurable army, with its shadow created by bows and arrows, and adorned with great brilliance, was increasing his prowess. ||143|| His great chariot, with a central pillar resembling a divine palace, and a flag of Yama, was shining, difficult to look at for the enemy army. ||144|| Behind Krtaanta, there was Trimurdha, then Agnishikha, then Singhavikrama, then Dirghabahu, then Singhodara, Sumeru, the powerful Balikhilya, the extremely angry Raudrabhuti, Sharabha, Syandana, the angry Vanakarna, Maridatta, who loved war, and Mrigendravahan, with his mind filled with intoxication, and other five thousand vassals emerged. All these vassals were bearing darkness in the form of various weapons, and groups of charanas were singing the praises of their countless virtues. ||145-148|| In the same way, the many ranks of the Kumaris, who were accompanied by deceitful armies, who had cast their gaze for a moment upon the weapons that had proven their worth, whose enthusiasm was increasing due to the joy of war, who were devoted to their lord, who were powerful, who were swift, and who had shaken the earth, also emerged. ||149-150|| Some of them were on chariots, some were on tall elephants, some were like dense clouds of arrows, and others were on horses, like waves of a great ocean. ||151||

Page #277:
---------------------------
254
Many, whose faces were turned away from the directions due to the loud noise of the enemy, who were adorned with shields and helmets, whose minds were filled with anger, and whose servants were of the past, extremely valiant, and eager to gain happiness, went out mounted on chariots as high as mountains, on elephants like clouds, on horses like ocean waves, on palanquins with peaks, and on extremely worthy bulls. ||151-153||
Then, hearing the sound of the enemy army and filled with confusion, Vajrajas instructed his own army to be ready. ||154||
Then, hearing the sound of the enemy army, all the soldiers, covered with armor, etc., were ready and came to the battlefield themselves. ||155||
The fierce-bodied, fierce-limbed, Nepal, Barbar, Paundra, Magadha, Sausna, Parashala, Sinhala, Kalinka, and Ratnaka, etc., mighty kings, with eleven thousand, equipped with excellent energy, were ready for battle. ||156-157||
Thus, that army, which had turned its face towards the enemy army, and in which weapons were moving, attained a great battle formation, i.e., there was a fierce encounter between the two armies. ||158||
There was such a terrible encounter between the two armies, which was even more wonderful than the previous encounter between the gods and demons, and was making a great sound like the encounter of two oceans that had been stirred up. ||159||
"Oh, you insignificant one! Strike first, give up your weapon, why are you neglecting? My weapon never gets ready to strike first." ||160||
"Oh, he struck lightly, so my arm remained healthy, i.e., nothing happened to it, strike hard on the body with a firm fist." ||161||
"Come forward a little, the arrow is not moving properly in the battle, or else give up the arrow and take up the dagger." ||162||
"Why are you trembling? I will not kill you, leave the path, this other valiant warrior, agile like a spark from the great fire of battle, is standing in front." ||163||
"Oh, you insignificant one! Why are you roaring in vain? There is no power in your words, I am worshipping the battle by your efforts." ||164||
Thus, from the mouths of the valiant warriors, very deep, great sounds were coming out all around. ||165||
1. Kaalanalaah prachudaanga-m०, j० । 2. Tejasah m० । 3. Vartate m ।

## Padma Purana, Chapter 1

166. Just as a terrifying sound arose from the earthly kings, so too did a great sound arise from the celestial kings.

167. Bhamandala, the valiant Pavanavega, the brilliant Mrganga like lightning, and Devachanda, the representative of the great Vidyaadhara kings, all equipped with large armies and skilled in great battles, stood on the side of Lavanaankusha.

168. Having heard of the true origin of Lavanaankusha, Hanuman, who was extremely knowledgeable in the application of the knowledge of duty, weakened the clash of the celestial kings and joined the side of Lavanaankusha.

169. Holding the weapon called Langul, Hanuman emerged from Rama's army, filling Bhamandala's heart with joy.

170. Seeing Janaki seated on the top of the chariot, all the celestial kings became indifferent.

171. They folded their hands and bowed to her with great respect, standing around her, filled with immense wonder.

172. Seeing the clash of the two armies, Sita's eyes became restless like those of a frightened deer, her body trembled, and she felt a shiver.

173. Then, shaking that vast army with its fluttering flags, Lavanaankusha, the bearer of Padma Lakshmi, advanced towards Rama and Lakshmana.

174. Thus, the two Kumaras, Singh and Garuda, bearing their respective flags, stood before Rama and Lakshmana, their faces filled with hostility.

175. As soon as he arrived, Anangalavana, wielding his weapon, cut down Ramadeva's flag and shattered his bow.

176. Laughing, Rama was about to take up another bow when the valiant Lavana swiftly disarmed him.

177. Then, the powerful and valiant Rama, with furrowed brows, mounted another chariot and, filled with anger, moved towards Anangalavana.

178. With eyes as unfathomable as the summer sun, Rama, raising his bow, approached Anangalavana just as the Asura Kumaras approached Indra, the lord of the thunderbolt.

The son of Janaki, Ananga-Lavaṇa, raised his bow with arrows and approached Padmanabha to give him a taste of the battle. ||18|| Then there was a fierce battle between Padmanabha and Lavaṇa, a clash of weapons, harsh and terrible. ||182|| Just as there was a great battle between Padmanabha and Lavaṇa, so too was there a great battle between Lakṣmaṇa and Aṅkuśa. ||183|| Thus there was a duel between the lords, who were eager for their own glory, and their followers, who were eager for the glory of their own heroes. ||184|| In one place, a group of horses, their hooves churning the ground like waves, were held back by the enemy's chariot, making the battlefield dense. ||185|| In another place, a warrior, his armor broken, saw the enemy standing before him, and, filled with the dust of battle, turned his face away. ||186|| Some warriors, abandoning their lord, entered the enemy's ranks, calling out the names of their lords and slaying those they saw. ||187|| Some proud, arrogant warriors, ignoring men, were engaged in battle with maddened elephants, their tusks dripping with blood. ||188|| One valiant warrior, taking refuge in the tusks of a maddened elephant, found the supreme pleasure of battle-sleep, that is, he was killed by the elephant's tusks. ||189|| One valiant warrior, whose weapon was broken, did not give way to the oncoming horse, but struck his hand against it and gave up his life. ||190|| One warrior, who had fallen in the first attack, was still being struck by a valiant warrior, even though he was begging for mercy. ||191|| One warrior, whose weapon had fallen, but whose spirit had not, abandoned his weapon and prepared to fight with his bare arms. ||192|| Those who were known for their generosity, always valiant in battle, gave up their lives, but never turned their backs. ||193|| The chariot of one charioteer was bogged down in blood and mud, and though he was eager to whip his horses, he could not move quickly. ||194|| Thus, in that great battle, the chariots, drawn by horses that made a loud noise, were moving quickly, their wheels making a loud noise. ||195||

Padma Purana
The battlefield was filled with the sound of war elephants, the roar of warriors, and the cries of the wounded. The air was thick with the smell of blood and smoke. The ground was littered with the bodies of the fallen. The battle raged on, a whirlwind of steel and fire.

The warriors fought with a ferocity that was born of desperation. They knew that their lives were on the line, and they were determined to fight to the death. The battle was a spectacle of chaos and carnage.

The elephants, with their massive tusks and thick hides, were a formidable force. They charged into the enemy ranks, trampling everything in their path. The warriors, armed with swords, spears, and bows, fought back with all their might.

The battle raged on for hours, neither side gaining the upper hand. Finally, as the sun began to set, the tide of the battle turned. The warriors of the righteous side, led by their valiant king, began to push back the enemy.

The enemy, demoralized and exhausted, began to retreat. The warriors of the righteous side pursued them, driving them back to their own lands.

The battle was over. The righteous side had won a decisive victory. The king, his face grim but his eyes filled with pride, surveyed the battlefield. He knew that the victory had come at a great cost. Many of his warriors had fallen, and the land was stained with blood.

But he also knew that the victory was worth the price. He had saved his kingdom from the enemy, and he had brought peace to his people.

The king, his heart heavy with grief but his spirit filled with hope, turned to his people and said, "We have won this battle, but the war is not over. We must remain vigilant, for the enemy will surely return. But we will be ready for them. We will fight for our freedom, for our families, and for our land. We will never surrender!"

The people cheered, their voices filled with hope and determination. They knew that their king was a just and righteous ruler, and they were confident that he would lead them to victory.

The battle was over, but the war was just beginning. The king and his people knew that they had a long and difficult road ahead of them, but they were determined to fight for their freedom. They would never surrender.

The battle was a testament to the courage and determination of the human spirit. It was a reminder that even in the darkest of times, hope can prevail.

The battle was a story of victory, but it was also a story of loss. It was a story of the human cost of war. It was a story that would be told for generations to come.

The battle was a story that would never be forgotten.

## Chapter One Hundred and Three

The wise Gautama Swami said to King Shrenik, "O King of Magadha, be attentive, for I will now describe the battle in detail."

The charioteer of the ocean-like Alangala-lavaṇa was Vajrajangha, the renowned warrior of Madanankuśa was Prithu, the son of Chandrodara, the son of Sumitra, was Viradhit, and the charioteer of Indra, who was like Rama, was the sun-like Kritantavaktra.

With a loud roar, Rama, lifting the bow called Vanavarta, spoke to the commander of the Kritantavaktra army in a deep voice, "O Kritantavaktra, quickly drive your chariot towards the enemy. Why are you so sluggish, making your body heavy and weak?"

Hearing this, Kritantavaktra said, "O God, look at these horses, shattered by the arrows of this warrior. Are they succumbing to sleep, or are they free from all ailments, becoming sluggish?"

"They are not responding to hundreds of sweet words, nor to being struck with palms. They are stretching their bodies, making a great noise, and moving quickly. They are staining the earth red with streams of blood, as if showing their great affection for you."

"And look here, my arms, pierced by arrows that pierce armor, have become like garlands of blooming Kadamba flowers."

Hearing this, Rama also said, "My bow is also becoming weak, and like a painted bow, it is becoming useless."

"This mace-jewel has become useless, and the heavy arm-staff is causing pain due to the Sunavarta bow."

"This halberd-jewel of mine, which had subdued many enemy elephants, has become useless."

"Such is the fate of even the most powerful weapons, capable of destroying the enemy and protecting their own side." 

Page #282:
---------------------------
## English Translation:

**264**
**Padma Purana**

Just as the weapons of the undefeated one, the son of Kausalya, became useless, so too did the weapons of Lakshmana become useless in the face of Madanankusha. ||15||

Gautama Swami says that on the one hand, Rama and Lakshmana were aware of their kinship with Lavanaankusha, and thus fought with restraint, taking care not to inflict fatal blows. On the other hand, Rama and Lakshmana were unaware of Madanankusha's lineage, and thus fought without restraint. ||16||

Despite his weapons being rendered ineffective, Lakshmana, armed with divine weapons, remained undeterred. He unleashed a barrage of spears, chakra, and arrows upon Madanankusha, who countered the attack with a shower of vajra-dandas and arrows. Similarly, Anangalavana had countered Rama's onslaught of weapons. ||17-18||

Subsequently, Lavana wounded Rama with a spear near his chest, while the valiant Madanankusha, skilled in combat, struck Lakshmana. ||19||

Seeing Lakshmana, whose eyes and heart were spinning from the blow, Viradhit, overwhelmed with fear, turned his chariot back towards Ayodhya. ||20||

Regaining consciousness, Lakshmana, his eyes blazing with anger, saw the chariot turned away and exclaimed, "O Viradhit, you fool! What have you done? Turn the chariot back immediately! Do you not know that one does not retreat in battle?" ||21-22||

It is noble for a valiant warrior, whose body is riddled with arrows, to die facing his enemy, but this cowardly act is despicable. ||23||

How can those who are the leaders of men, who stand at the head of the human race, succumb to fear even when faced with the greatest adversity, amidst gods and men? ||24||

I am the son of Dasharatha, the brother of Rama, and known as Narayana on earth. How can such an act be fitting for him? ||25||

Thus, Lakshmana's words swiftly turned the chariot back, and a fierce battle ensued, with the enemy forces returning to the fray. ||26||

Driven by anger, Lakshmana, desiring to end the battle, unleashed a powerful chakra, a weapon that strikes fear into the hearts of gods and demons. ||27||

## The Vyuttarashatam Parva (Chapter 365)

**28.** The blazing, unbearable, sun-like wheel, wielded by the enraged Lakshmana, was aimed to strike the Ankusha.

**26.** Approaching the Ankusha, the wheel lost its brilliance and returned to Lakshmana's hand.

**30.** Lakshmana, filled with anger, repeatedly hurled the wheel towards the Ankusha, but it kept returning to him.

**31.** Seeing this, the valiant Ankusha Kumar, in a state of utter confusion, whirled his bow and arrow.

**32.** Witnessing this, all the warriors on the battlefield were filled with wonder and doubt.

**33.** "This is the supreme being, the wielder of the wheel, who has now appeared. His spinning wheel has thrown us all into confusion."

**34.** "Is this wheel stationary or in motion? Its thunderous roar is deafening."

**35.** "This wheel, known for its characteristics like the Kotishila, seems to be a delusion. How can it have appeared here for someone else?"

**36.** "How can the words of the Munis be false? Are the teachings of the Jina also meaningless?"

**37.** "This bow is spinning, and the sound is 'Chakra' (wheel). The hearts of those who had lost their minds were filled with anxiety."

**38.** Seeing Lakshmana's shame and inaction, the valiant Lakshmana, bearing the supreme strength, declared, "These two are indeed Balabhadra and Narayana."

**39.** Approaching Lakshmana, Siddhartha, with the approval of Narada, said, "O God, Narayana, you are here, how else could it be? The teachings of the Jina are unwavering, even more so than Mount Meru."

**40.** "These two Kumaras are the sons of Janaki, named Lavana and Ankusha. They were abandoned in the forest while still in her womb."

**41.** "I know that after abandoning Janaki, you fell into the ocean of sorrow. You are..."

**42.** "The fear-inducing, infallible Chakra-ratna (wheel-jewel) was lifted." 

Page #284:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, after knowing the greatness of the Lavanaankusha, Lakshmana, who was emaciated by grief, gave up his armor and weapons. ||43|| Hearing this account, Rama, who was burdened with sorrow, abandoned his bow and armor, his eyes rolling, remembering the past sorrow, descended from the chariot with great speed, and fell to the ground, his eyes closed due to unconsciousness. ||44-45|| Then, after being sprinkled with sandalwood-mixed water, he regained consciousness and, with a heart filled with love, quickly went to his sons. ||46|| 
Then, filled with love, both sons descended from the chariot, folded their hands, and bowed their heads to their father's feet. ||47|| After that, Rama, whose heart was melted with love and whose happiness seemed like a dark day due to tears, embraced both sons and began to lament. ||48|| He said, "Alas, my sons! When you were in the womb, I, with my foolish mind, abandoned you both, innocent children, in the terrible forest along with Sita. ||49|| Alas, my sons! Even though you were born to me due to great merit, how did you both, while still in the womb, attain supreme sorrow in the forest? ||50|| Alas, my sons! If that Vajrajangha had not been in that forest at that time, how could I have seen this full moon, your face? ||51|| Alas, my sons! The fact that you were not killed by those infallible weapons indicates that the gods or your own great merit protected you. ||52|| Alas, my sons! Seeing you both, fallen by arrows and on the battlefield, I don't know what Janaki would do. ||53|| The sorrow of exile and abandonment is unbearable even for other humans, so what would be the state of Sita, a virtuous woman, abandoned by her sons? ||54|| Knowing that you both, my noble sons, are no more, Sita, overwhelmed with grief, would surely not live. ||55|| Lakshmana, whose eyes were filled with tears and who was bewildered and distraught with grief, bowed his head in humility, his heart filled with love. ||56||

## The Hundredth Chapter of the Dhyuttar Shatam

The kings, led by Shatrughna, having heard this news, all went to that place and attained supreme joy. ||5.7|| Then, a gathering took place between the two armies, the masters of both armies, filled with joy and wonder, met. ||58|| Seeing the greatness of her sons and their reunion, Sita, with a resolute heart, returned to Pundarika in her celestial chariot. ||56|| 

Then, filled with excitement, the lord of the celestial realm descended from the sky and, with tearful eyes, embraced his two nephews, who were free from wounds. ||60|| Hanuman, eager to express his joy, embraced them both, repeatedly uttering the words, "Well done!" ||61|| 

Similarly, Viradhit and Sugriva attained a happy reunion, and kings like Vibhishana were eager to converse with the princes. ||62|| 

Then, a gathering took place, as crowded as the gods, of the earth-dwellers and the celestial beings, a gathering that gave rise to immense joy. ||63|| 

Having attained the supreme joy of the reunion with his sons, Rama, whose heart was filled with courage, bore the supreme Lakshmi. ||64|| 

Having attained an indescribable state, Rama considered the gain of those noble sons to be far more beautiful than the kingdom of the three worlds. ||65|| 

The wives of the celestial beings danced with great joy in the sky, which was like a courtyard, and the wives of the earth-dwellers danced on the earth, like a frenzied world. ||66|| 

Filled with joy, his eyes blooming, Narayana considered himself fulfilled and believed he had conquered the entire world. ||67|| 

"I am Sagara, and these two are the valiant Bhima and Bhagiratha," thus, with a mind filled with comparisons, Lakshmana bore the supreme radiance. ||68|| 

Bearing supreme joy, Rama honored the forest-dweller, saying, "You, with your beautiful heart, are like the entire celestial sphere to me." ||69|| 

Then, Ayodhya, already like heaven, was made even more beautiful. ||70|| 

She, who was naturally beautiful, with her special skills and knowledge, was honored by the kings for her conduct, which was the epitome of virtue. ||71||

Then, Rama, along with his sons, ascended the Pushpaka Vimana, which was situated on the back of the elephant-shaped mountain, and shone like the sun. ||72|| Just as a great cloud, accompanied by lightning, sits on the peak of Mount Sumeru, so too, Lakshmana, adorned with excellent ornaments, sat on the same Pushpaka Vimana. ||73|| Thus, they all proceeded slowly, seeing the gardens, temples, and fortresses filled with flags outside the city. ||74|| The roads of the city, filled with elephants, horses, chariots, and foot soldiers, whose three places were filled with intoxication, were darkened by bows, flags, and umbrellas. ||75|| The windows of the palaces were filled with a group of beautiful women, filled with great curiosity to see Lavana and Ankusha. ||76|| The generous-hearted women, who were eager to drink the nectar of Lavana and Ankusha with their eyes, were not satisfied. ||77|| The women who were looking at them, with their minds fixed on one thing, did not even notice that their necklaces and earrings had fallen off due to the jostling of the crowd. ||78|| Mother, please move your face away from here, don't I have any curiosity? Oh, you who are always curious, how much is your selfishness? ||79|| Friend, please lower your head a little out of kindness. Why are you standing so stiffly? Move your braid from here. ||80|| Oh, lifeless one! Oh, you with a distracted mind! Why are you tormenting others like this? Don't you see this tormented girl in front of you? ||81|| Move aside, I have fallen, why are you becoming unconscious like this? Why don't you see the prince? ||82|| Alas, mother! What kind of woman is this? What is the use to you if I see her? Why do you stop my inspirer? ||83|| These two princes, who are sitting on either side of Rama, are Lavana and Ankusha, who have foreheads like the crescent moon. ||84|| Who is Ananga Lavana and who is Madana Ankusha among them? Oh! Both these princes are very similar in appearance. ||85|| The one who wears a red armor, dyed with the color of pure silver, is Lavana, and the one who wears a parrot-colored garment is Ankusha. ||86||

The One Hundred and Third Chapter
Oh, how virtuous is Sita, whose sons are so excellent! Oh, how blessed is the woman who will be their wife! ||87||
Thus, many stories were being told, captivating the minds and ears of those women whose eyes were fixed on the one. ||88||
None of them noticed that her cheek, which had been struck by the force of the collision, was wounded by the serpent-like earring. ||8||
Due to the pressure of another woman's arm, someone's breast was raised within the tight bodice, shining like the moon with clouds. ||60||
One woman's anklet fell off, but she didn't notice, but when she turned back, she stumbled and fell because of the same anklet. ||61||
Someone's garment was torn by the sharp teeth of a spider, and an old woman was telling someone about it. ||62||
When someone's mind was distracted, and their body became weak, their dangling arm fell from the force of the shock. ||63||
Someone's necklace, entangled in another woman's ear ornament, broke and fell, scattering like a garland of flowers. ||64||
The eyes of some women remained unblinking as they looked at the two princes, and they remained unblinking even when the princes were far away. ||65||
Malini Vritta
Thus, from the mountain-like mansions, the dust from the fallen flowers of the vine-like women, turned the sky a dusky color. The glorious kings, Rama and the others, entered the auspicious palace, which was extremely beautiful. ||66||
Drut Vilambit Vritta
The people, whose minds are awakened by the sun of virtue, enjoy this kind of festival, which is beyond compare, and is the gathering of beloved beings. ||67||
Thus ends the One Hundred and Third Chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the Rama-Lavana-Ankusha Samagama, narrated by the sage Sri Vishena Acharya. ||103||
Lavana is the one who holds, and Ankusha is the one who wears green clothes like the wings of a parrot. ||6||

Chapter One Hundred and Four

Then, on another day, the king, Haladhara, was informed.  He was accompanied by the chieftains, Marunandan, Sugriva, and Vibhishana. ||1|| 
"O Lord, be pleased.  Janaka's daughter is in distress in another land.  Let an order be given to bring her back." ||2||
Sighing deeply and warmly, he pondered for a moment.  Then, with a face darkened by tears, Padmaabha spoke. ||3||
"I know Sita's character to be pure and her mind noble.  But how can I look upon her face, since she has been subject to slander?" ||4||
"Let Janaki first convince the entire world.  Only then can we live with her, there is no other way." ||5||
"Therefore, in this world, let the kings, along with the people of their lands, and all the celestial beings, be invited with great love." ||6||
"Let Sita, born of a blameless lineage, be declared pure, like Sachi, after taking an oath in front of them, according to proper procedure." ||7||
"So be it," they said, accepting the proposal without delay.  Kings were gathered from all lands and all directions. ||8||
People from various lands, including children, elders, and women, arrived in Ayodhya, filled with great curiosity. ||9||
Even women who had never seen the sun came there, filled with confusion.  What then can be said of ordinary people? ||10||
Those who were very old, experts in many stories, renowned leaders of nations, and others, all came together. ||11||
At that time, the vast crowd, moving together, turned the entire earth into a path, in all directions. ||12||
The masses arrived on horses, chariots, bulls, palanquins, and various other vehicles. ||13||
Celestial beings were arriving from above, and earth-bound creatures from below.  At that time, the world seemed to be moving, as if it were alive. ||14||

##  English Translation:

**15.**  Beautifully crafted play-mountains, with four hundred and twenty-seven (271) pavilions, were built.  Vast and magnificent halls, adorned with fine cloth-canopies, were erected. 

**16.**  Palaces, adorned with spacious verandahs, were built, supported by pillars, and embellished with elegant latticework.

**17.**  Women stood with women, and men with men, all eager to witness the oath, arranged according to their status.

**18.**  The royal officials provided all comforts for the visitors, including beds, seats, betel nut, food, and garlands.

**19.**  Then, at Rama's command, Vibhishana, the son of the wind, the king of Kishkindha, Sugriva, Viradha, and Ratnajaati, all great and powerful kings, reached Paundarika-pura in an instant, traveling through the sky.

**20.**  They left their armies outside, and accompanied by their inner circle, entered Sita's abode, having been informed and granted permission.

**21.**  Upon entering, they raised shouts of victory for Sita, offered floral tributes, joined their hands, bowed their heads, and prostrated themselves at her feet.

**22.**  They sat down on the earth, adorned with beautiful, gem-studded carpets, and engaged in conversation, bowing respectfully in the presence of the queen.

**23.**  Sita, her eyes filled with tears, spoke in a low voice, her words mostly filled with self-reproach.

**24.**  She said, "My body, scorched by the fire of the wicked's words, finds no solace even in the waters of the ocean of milk."

**25.**  Then they said, "O Devi! O Bhagavati! O Uttama! O Saumya! Let go of your sorrow now, and bring your mind back to its natural state."

**26.**  "Who in this world would dare to speak ill of you? Who can move the earth, or drink the fire's flame?

**27.**  "Who has the audacity to lift Mount Meru? Who, with a foolish tongue, would lick the bodies of the moon and the sun?

**28.**  "Who is capable of moving the mountain of your virtues? Whose tongue can be shattered into a thousand pieces by slander?"

**29.**  "We have appointed a group of servants in the land of Bharata, with the order to kill anyone who dares to speak ill of the Devi."

## Padma Purana

**31.** Even the most lowly person on earth, who is devoted to the story of Sita's virtues, will be showered with jewels in the home of the virtuous.

**32.** Driven by their love, the people of the fields, seeking prosperity in their crops, establish her in their mounds of grain. (Meaning: People believe that establishing Sita in their mounds of grain will lead to a bountiful harvest.)

**33.** O Devi! Ramachandra has sent this Pushpaka Vimana for you. Be pleased and ascend it. Go and proceed towards Ayodhya.

**34.** Just as a tree without vines, a house without lamps, and the sky without the moon are not beautiful, so too, Rama, Ayodhya, and the land are not beautiful without you.

**35.** O Maithili! See your husband's face, radiant like the full moon, soon. O Kovide! You must surely accept your husband's word.

**36.** Thus spoken to, Sita, adorned with a hundred excellent women, ascended the Pushpaka Vimana and, with great splendor, sped through the sky.

**37.** Then, as she saw Ayodhya, the sun set. Thus, filled with anxiety, she spent the night in the garden called Mahendrodya.

**38.** The garden that had seemed so beautiful to her when she was with Rama, now seemed unsuitable, as she remembered the past events.

**39.** Then, as if by the pure love of Sita, the sun rose, adorning the entire world with its rays, like servants. And as if by an oath, darkness, like a liar, was overcome with fear and perished. Sita then proceeded towards Rama.

**40.** She mounted an elephant whose radiance was diminished by her own anxiety. She was like a great medicinal herb, illuminated by the sun's rays, situated on the peak of a mountain, though lacking its own brilliance.

**41.** Yet, surrounded by noble women, filled with good intentions, Sita, slender and graceful, shone brightly, like the moon's orb surrounded by stars.

**42.** Then, Sita, the courageous wife of Rama, entered the vast, solemn, and respectful assembly, where she was worshipped and praised by all.

**43.** The sea of people, filled with sorrow, wonder, joy, and peace, cried out in unison, "May you prosper, O daughter of Janaka, and never grow old!"

## Chapter One Hundred and Four

**Oh!** How glorious is the form of Sita, the daughter of the noble King Janaka! **Oh!** How glorious is her courage! **Oh!** How glorious is her strength! **Oh!** How glorious is her radiance! **Oh!** How glorious is her magnanimity! **Oh!** How glorious is her profound wisdom! **Oh!** How glorious is her spotless purity, made evident by her return!  ||45-46||

Thus, from the mouths of men and women, adorned with joyous bodies, words filled the entire space between the directions. ||47||

In the sky, the celestial beings, and on earth, the earth-dwellers, all stood with intense curiosity, their eyes wide open. ||48||

Some men and women, filled with immense joy, were gazing at Rama with the same intensity as the gods gaze at Indra. ||49||

Some, standing near Rama, saw the bow and arrow, and exclaimed, "Oh! These two delicate weapons are worthy of him!" ||50||

Some praised Lakshmana, the destroyer of enemies. Some praised Shatrughna. Some praised the beautiful Janaka's daughter. Some praised Hanuman, the lord of Kishkindha. Some praised Vibhishana. Some praised Viradha. Some praised Sugriva. ||51-52||

Some, with minds filled with wonder, were gazing at Janaka's daughter. It was as if she was the dwelling place of their eyes, which were constantly wandering. ||53||

Then, approaching Sita, whose heart was filled with anxiety, and seeing Rama, she thought, "The ocean of separation has finally come to an end." ||54||

When Sita arrived, Lakshmana offered her water. The kings, standing near Rama, were overwhelmed with joy and bowed to her. ||55||

Then, seeing Sita approaching with great speed, Rama, though invincible, felt his heart tremble. ||56||

He thought, "I had left her in the forest, filled with ferocious beasts. How could she, who stole my eyes, come back here?" ||57||

"Oh! How shameless she is! How powerful she is! Even after being banished, she does not give up her attachment." ||58||

Then, understanding Rama's gesture, Sita, with a heart filled with despair, thought, "My separation from him has not ended." ||59|| 

Page #292:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, 
The heart of the one who is separated from his beloved has become like a ship that has reached the shore of the ocean of separation. It is certain that it will be destroyed.  She was filled with anxiety. [6]
Bewildered about what to do, Sita, with her toe, scratched the ground, standing near Balarama. [6]
The daughter of Janaka, standing before him, shone like Lakshmi in the city of Indra. [2]
Then Rama said to Sita, "Why are you standing in front? Move away, I am not able to look at you." [63]
My eyes are able to bear the midday sun's brilliance or the crest of the serpent's gem, but not to look at you. [64]
You were confined in the palace of Dasha-asya for many months, and yet I brought you back. What was all this for me? [65]
Then Vaidehi said, "There is no one more cruel than you. You are rejecting me like a common man rejects a good education." [66]
You, with your crooked mind, took me to the forest under the pretext of Dohada, and left me pregnant. What is this like for you? [67]
If I had attained a bad state there, what would have been achieved by you, the cause of my misfortune? [68]
If there is even a little bit of good feeling or kindness in you, why didn't you take me to the residence of the peaceful Aryikas? [69]
This Jina-shaasana is the ultimate refuge for the orphans, the friendless, the poor, and the extremely sorrowful. [70]
Even though this has happened, O Padma-abha, be pleased. What is there to say? Give me your command. Saying this, she cried in sorrow. [71]
Rama said, "O Devi, I know your blameless character, your devotion to your husband, and the purity of your intentions. But since you have been subjected to this public slander, convince these people who are naturally crooked-minded." [73]

Thus spoke the daughter of Janaka, filled with joy. And I, too, declare this truth to the world with five divine oaths. ||7|| O Lord, I can drink the Kalakuta, the most potent poison among all poisons, the very smell of which instantly reduces the Ashvi poison serpent to ashes. ||7|| I can ascend the balance, or enter the fierce flames of fire, or I can take any oath that you desire. ||76|| After a moment's thought, Padmaabha said, "Let her enter the fire." And the great, ever-joyful Sita said, "I will enter." ||77|| "She has accepted death," lamented Narada. The kings of the Sri Saila, overwhelmed with grief, were distressed. ||7|| Knowing that their mother wished to enter the fire, Lavana and Angusha, with great wisdom, decided in their minds, "We too will enter the fire." ||7|| Then, filled with great power and immense joy, Siddhartha Ksullaka, raising his arm, said, "Even the gods cannot fully describe the virtue of Sita, what then of lowly beings like us?" ||80-81|| O Rama, Mount Meru can enter the netherworld, and the oceans can dry up, but there can be no wavering in Sita's virtue. ||81|| The moon can become the sun, and the sun can become the moon, but Sita's accusation can never attain truth. ||82-83|| I am rich in knowledge and power, and I have worshipped the Jina images in the eternal, unmade shrines on the five peaks of Mount Meru. O Rama, I declare with certainty that if there is even a slight flaw in Sita's virtue, then my rare worship will be rendered fruitless. ||84-85|| I have performed austerities for thousands of years, wearing only a loincloth. I swear by that austerity, I declare with the oath of my austerity, that these are indeed your sons. ||86|| Therefore, O wise Rama, do not let Sita enter that fire, which is filled with terrifying waves of flames and which destroys all.

In the Padma Purana,
The Vyogn Vaidyaras, the celestial beings, and the earth-dwellers, the Dharani Charas, exclaimed, "Well said, well said!" with a loud voice, as if liberated from a great burden. ||8||
"Be pleased, O God, be pleased, attain tranquility. O Lord! O Rama! O Rama! Do not entertain thoughts of fire in your mind." ||8||
"Sita is virtuous, Sita is virtuous, there is no other possibility. The wives of great men do not become corrupted." ||10||
Thus, the words, choked with tears, spread out from the agitated sea of people, encompassing all directions. ||11||
Large drops of tears fell from the deeply sorrowful beings, accompanied by a great roar. ||12||
Padma said, "If you are so inclined to show mercy, then why did you speak against her earlier?" ||13||
Thus, as if giving orders, Rama, who had fixed his mind on purity, relying on his supreme strength, commanded his servants, ||14||
"Dig two pits here, deep and three hundred cubits wide, square in shape. Then, fill them with dry, thick fuel of black agarwood and sandalwood, and make a fire that burns fiercely and quickly, a fire that appears like death itself, without delay." ||15-17||
Having said, "As you are commanded," the servants, with large axes in their hands, who were even more efficient than the servants of Yama, carried out all the tasks. ||18||
At the same time when Rama and Sita were having this conversation, and the servants were carrying out the terrifying task of setting fire, in the night that followed, the Muni Raja, adorned with all ornaments, was meditating in the Mahendrodya garden. Due to a previous enmity, a Rakshasi named Vidyudvaktra inflicted a great calamity upon him. ||66-101||
Then, King Shrenik asked the Muni Punagava, the Gautama Swami,

Chapter One Hundred and Four

In the northern range of the Vijayadhapa mountain, in the city of Gunja, which was adorned everywhere, there lived a king named Singhavikram. His queen was named Shri, and they had a son named Sakalabhusan. Sakalabhusan had eight hundred wives, of whom Kiranmandala was the chief. 

Kiranmandala, who possessed a pure heart, once, at the instigation of her co-wives, drew a picture of her maternal uncle's son, Hemashikha, in a romantic scene. Seeing this, the king was instantly filled with extreme anger. However, at the urging of his other wives, he regained his composure.

One night, the virtuous Kiranmandala was sleeping with her husband. In her sleep, she repeatedly uttered the name of Hemarath, due to a lapse in her mindfulness. Hearing this, the king was extremely enraged and, in his anger, renounced the world. Kiranmandala, on the other hand, became a saintly woman and, after death, became a Rakshasi named Vidyudvaktara.

When Sakalabhusan, now a monk, was wandering for alms, the wicked Rakshasi, filled with anger, would constantly try to harm him. Sometimes she would break the bonds of a wild elephant, sometimes she would set fire to his house, sometimes she would cause a rain of dust, sometimes she would appear before him as a horse or a bull, and sometimes she would cover the path with thorns.

Once, while the monk was seated in a state of meditation, she broke into his house, brought him before the image of a deity, and seized him, claiming he was a thief. A crowd of people gathered, shouting and trying to capture him. Some, who were indifferent to the truth, scorned him and then released him.

Another time, when he was going out after taking his meal, the woman who had served him tied a necklace around his neck and declared him a thief.

Thus, the cruel and wicked Rakshasi, filled with malice, constantly tormented him with one affliction after another.

Later, the monk was seated in a state of meditation in the garden called Mahendroyana. The Rakshasi, driven by her past animosity, inflicted further torment upon him. She would appear as a Vetala, an elephant, a lion, a snake, or a beautiful woman with various qualities, all with the intention of harming him. 

When asked about the connection between these afflictions and the monk's past, the Lord Ganadhara said, "O King, listen!" 

Page #296:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
When these troubles did not shake their mind, then the Muni's knowledge of Kevala arose. || 117 ||
Then, with their minds filled with the glory of Kevala-Sam-bhooti, Indra and all the other gods and demons came, led by Sunashi. || 118 ||
With elephants, lions, horses, camels, donkeys, large tigers, eight-legged creatures, Samaras, birds, airplanes, chariots, bulls, and other beautiful vehicles, they covered the sky and all came towards Ayodhya. Their hair, clothes, and banners were fluttering in the wind, and their crowns, earrings, and necklaces shone brightly in the sky. || 118-121 ||
The gods, surrounded by groups of Apsaras, descended happily, looking down at the earth. || 122 ||
Seeing Sita's story, the god named Meshaketu said to Indra, "O Indra, look at this very difficult task." || 123 ||
"O Lord, this Sita is being afflicted by something that even the gods find difficult to touch and which causes great fear. How is this happening to her?" || 124 ||
"How can this affliction come upon this Shravaka, who is virtuous and has a very pure heart?" || 125 ||
Then Akhandala said, "I am going to worship the all-adorned Kevali. You do whatever is necessary here." || 126 ||
Saying this, Indra went towards the Mahendrodya garden, and Meshaketu went to Sita's place. || 127 ||
There, in the sky, he stood on the top of his airplane, shining brightly in all directions, like the peak of Mount Meru. || 128 ||
The Arya-Giti Chanda says,
"The sun-like, radiant Meshaketu, standing on the top of his airplane, saw Rama, who was pleasing to all." || 126 ||
Thus ends the 104th chapter of the Padma Purana, narrated by the Acharya Sri Ravishena, which describes the arrival of the gods at the Kevala-Jnana festival of the all-adorned Kevali. || 104 ||
1. The text "samudyotayate disham" is not found in this book. It is not found in other books either.

Chapter One Hundred and Five. Seeing the pond filled with dry wood and grass, Rama, the moon of the Kakutstha dynasty, became troubled in mind.  ||1||

How can I see this beloved again, who is a collection of virtues, endowed with great beauty, and adorned with grace and character? ||2||

This beloved, with a body as delicate as a garland of blooming jasmine, will surely be destroyed by the mere touch of fire. ||3||

If she had not been born in the lineage of King Janaka, she would not have faced this public disgrace and death in the fire. ||4||

How can I find happiness, even for a moment, without her? It is better to live in the forest with her than to be in heaven without her. ||5||

Even though she is of great and unwavering heart, she is determined to die.  She is entering the fire with determination, and it is shameful to try to stop her in front of everyone. ||6||

Even this insignificant Siddhartha, who makes a great noise, is silent. What excuse can I give to stop this? ||7||

Or, whoever has earned a particular kind of death, will inevitably meet that death. Who can stop the darkness that is destined to come? ||8||

When this devoted wife was being carried away over the salt sea, why didn't Ravana, enraged by the thought "She doesn't want me," cut off her head with his sword? This would have spared her from this unbearable doubt. ||9-10||

Death is preferable to unbearable separation, for separation is a most despicable thing, destroying both hearing and memory. ||11||

Separation brings sorrow to the heart for as long as one lives, and the desire for stories and memories related to the departed is instantly extinguished upon hearing the news of their death. ||12||

Thus, while Rama was consumed with worry, the fire was lit in the pond. The compassionate women began to weep. ||13|| 

Page #298:

Padmapurana
Then the sky, darkened by smoke, became filled with dense clouds. It seemed as if the rainy season had arrived untimely and enveloped everything. ||14||
The world then seemed to be filled with bees, or perhaps with cuckoos, or perhaps with pigeons. It was a different world altogether. ||15||
Unable to bear the sight of such a calamity, the compassionate Sun quickly hid himself somewhere. ||16||
In that pond, a terrible fire blazed, its great force spreading in all directions, with flames as long as chariots. ||17||
Seeing that fire, one wondered: Is the sky being covered by thousands of suns rising simultaneously? Or has a multitude of Palasa trees from the netherworld suddenly risen up? Or has the sky been enveloped by the twilight of the end of the world? Or is this entire world preparing to become golden? Or is the entire world becoming filled with lightning? Or has another moving Mount Meru been born out of a desire to conquer? ||18-20||
Then Sita, whose mind was extremely steadfast, rose up and, for a moment, renounced her body. She praised the Jinas, who had been attained through devotion, and bowed to the Tirthankaras, beginning with Rishabha. She bowed to the Siddhas, all the Sadhus, and the Muni Suvrata Jina, whose Tirtha was then being served by the gods, demons, and humans, who were filled with joy and possessed supreme power. With her mind fixed on the feet of the Acharya, who was dedicated to the welfare of all beings, Sita, who was noble, profound, and extremely humble, spoke. ||21-24||
"I have not cherished any other man in my mind, speech, or action, not even in a dream. This is my truth." ||25||
"If I am speaking falsely, then may this fire, even though it is far away, reduce me to ashes in an instant." ||26||
"And if I have not cherished any other man in my mind, even for a moment, then may this fire, which is filled with purity, not touch me." ||27||

## Chapter 55

**28.** "If I am a false believer, a sinner, a petty one, and an adulteress, then this fire will burn me. But if I am a virtuous woman, abiding by my vows, then it will not be able to touch me." 

**29.** Having said this, the goddess entered the fire. But, surprisingly, the fire transformed into crystal-clear, pleasant, and cool water.

**30.** As if the earth had suddenly burst open, the water surged forth, filling the pond to the brim and creating waves.

**31.** There was no fuel, no wood, no embers, no grass, or anything else that could indicate the presence of fire.

**32.** Powerful whirlpools formed in the pond, their edges adorned with swirling foam, moving with great speed, deep and terrifying to behold.

**33.** The sound of a mridanga drum could be heard in some places, a "gulugul" sound in others, a "bhumbhumbh" sound elsewhere, and a "patpat" sound in yet another place.

**34.** In some places, there were roars, in others, long, drawn-out groans, in some, a "dimidi mi" sound, in others, a "jugud jugud" sound, in some, a "kal kal" sound, in others, a "shasad bhasad" sound, and in some, a sound like a silver bell.

**35.** The pond, with its roaring, ocean-like sounds, was churning and tossing, and in an instant, it began to engulf the people standing on the shore.

**36.** The water rose to knee-level in an instant, then to hip-level, and then, in the blink of an eye, it reached breast-level.

**37.** Before the water could reach the height of a man, the people on earth were terrified, and the celestial beings, who lived in the sky, were filled with anxiety, wondering what to do.

**38.** When the water, surging with great force, reached their necks, the people were overwhelmed with fear and climbed onto the platforms. But soon, even the platforms began to sink.

**39.** When the water rose above their heads, many people started to swim. At that time, one of their arms was holding their clothes and the other was holding their children.

**40.** "Oh, Goddess! Oh, Saraswati, the giver of wealth, the great benefactor, the protector of dharma, the well-wisher of all beings, save us!"

Padma Purana
"Have mercy, O noble one! O Lakshmi! O Saraswati! O great auspicious one! O one with Dharma! O one who desires the welfare of all beings! Protect us!"  [41] "Have mercy, O great wife of a husband! O one with a pure mind like that of a sage!"  Thus, words were uttered from the mouths of people who were terrified by the water. [42]
Then, the bride in the form of the pond, with hands in the form of waves, touched Rama's two feet, which were as soft as the center of a lotus and adorned with nails. In an instant, she attained a gentle state. Her muddy whirlpools became calm, and her terrifying sound ceased. From this, the people also became happy. [43-44]
That pond, in an instant, became filled with blue lotuses, white lotuses, and ordinary lotuses. It became beautiful with the music of a swarm of intoxicated bees, buzzing with fragrance. [45]
It was adorned with groups of beautiful-sounding cranes, chakravakas, swans, and ducks. [46]
Its banks became extremely beautiful with steps made of jewels and gold, situated amidst the waves, and with soft, emerald-colored flowers. [47]
Then, in the middle of that pond, a large, pure, auspicious, blooming, and extremely soft thousand-petaled lotus appeared. In the middle of that lotus, a throne was situated, which was covered with various kinds of jewels, adorned with a garment of the light of jewels, and equal in brilliance to the moon. [48-49]
Then, Sita, who was being comforted by the best of the divine women with the words "Do not fear," was seated on the throne. At that time, Sita, who was adorned with an astonishing rise, was as beautiful as Lakshmi. [50]
Groups of gods in the sky, satisfied, released garlands of flowers, along with the sound "Very good, very good." [51]
The beautiful instrument called Guja resonated, the drums made a loud sound, the Nandis were overjoyed, the Kahalas made a sweet sound, the groups of conch shells sounded, the Turyas made a deep sound, the flutes made a clear sound, and the bronze cymbals made a sweet sound. [52-53]
The groups of Vidyadharas, who were eager to perform the actions of Valgita, Vedita, Udhrishta, and Krusht, danced together, filled with satisfaction. [54]
The daughter of the glorious King Janaka, the wife of the glorious Balarama, was victorious. [55]

Oh, what a wonder, what a wonder, her character is so pure. Thus, the two, having reached the sky, stood there. ||56||
Then, with their hearts filled with genuine love for their mother, Labana and Ankusha, having crossed the water with great speed, reached Sita. ||57||
Standing on either side of her, with their love for their mother growing, they comforted her, smelled her, and bowed their heads in reverence. ||58||
Seeing Sita, whose body was as pure as a golden rod purified in fire, and whose form was surrounded by a multitude of brilliant lights, and who resided in a lotus-like home, Rama, his heart filled with great love, approached her. ||59-60||
And he said, "O Goddess! Be happy, you are blessed, worshipped by the best of men, your face is like the full moon of the autumn season, and you are a performer of wondrous deeds." ||61||
"I will never commit such an offense again, or your sorrow has passed. O virtuous one! Forgive my fault." ||62||
"You are the supreme goddess of eight thousand women. You reside on their heads, command them, and exercise your dominion over me as well." ||63||
"O truthful one! Due to my ignorance, I have caused you pain out of fear of gossip. ||64||
"My dear! Now, roam freely with me in this earth, which is bounded by the ocean, along with forests, groves, and the people of the celestial beings." ||65||
"You, who are worshipped by the entire world with the utmost respect, enjoy pleasures equal to those of the gods on your earthly plane." ||66||
"O Goddess! Ascend the Pushpaka chariot, which is like the rising sun and travels according to desire, and see the summit of Mount Meru with me, that is, travel everywhere with me." ||67||
"O beloved! Let us play in those places that captivate your heart, with me, who am obedient to your word." ||68||
"O noble one! Surrounded by the best women of the celestial beings, like the celestial women, enjoy your wealth immediately." ||69||
Ralak, with folded hands, was saying, "Victory to the daughter of King Janaka and victory to the most fortunate wife of Lord Balabhadra, Lord Rama." ||55||
Oh, what a wonder, what a wonder, her character is so pure. ||55-56||

Padma Purana
Why
.
Even though I am submerged in the ocean of faults and devoid of wisdom, I have come to you, O praiseworthy one! Be pleased and abandon anger. ||70||
Then, Sita said to the king, "O king! I am not angry with anyone. Why are you so afflicted with sorrow? ||71||
There is no fault of yours or of any other person in this land. This is the fruit of my own actions, which has come to fruition. ||72||
O Baldeva! I have enjoyed pleasures like those of the gods by your grace. Therefore, I do not desire them. Now, I will do that which will prevent me from being a woman again. ||73||
What is the use of these pleasures, which are enjoyed by foolish humans, when I am afflicted by these destructive, painful, and intense pangs of hunger? ||74||
Having traversed through millions of wombs, I have attained this immense sorrow. Now, I seek the destruction of sorrows and embrace the Jain initiation. ||75||
Having said this, with hands like the new shoots of the Ashoka tree, she plucked her own hair and gave it to Rama, being free from attachment. ||76||
Seeing her hair, which was as radiant as the Indranila gem, extremely soft, and beautiful, Rama fainted and fell to the ground. ||77||
While Rama was being revived with sandalwood and other things, Sita was initiated by the Aryika on the earth. ||78||
Then, by divine grace, she became free from all obstacles and became a virtuous Shramana, possessing only clothes as her possessions. ||79||
Her body was purified by the great ascetics, and she was filled with great fervor. She went to the best garden, where gods and demons gather. ||80||
When Rama regained consciousness, due to the wind carrying the scent of pearl garlands, sandalwood paste, and fans, he looked in that direction, but he did not see Sita. All ten directions seemed empty to him. Finally, his mind was clouded with sorrow and anger, and he mounted a great elephant. ||81-82||
At that time, a white umbrella was waving over his head, a group of chamaras were being waved, and he was surrounded by many kings. Therefore, the gods...

The Uttarashada Parva

"The death of a beloved being is preferable to separation from him." This was my earlier vow, made with a determined mind. ||85||

If that is so, why did the gods, in their folly, cause this great distress to Sita, leading her to undertake this arduous penance? ||86||

O gods! Even though she has shaved her head, if you do not quickly restore her to me, I will declare you as non-gods, I will not consider you as gods, and I will make the world into the sky. ||87||

How can my wife be taken away by the gods who are supposed to uphold justice? Let them stand before me and take up arms. Where have they all gone? ||88||

Thus, Rama, who was engaged in various activities and was being consoled by Lakshmana, who was well-versed in various strategies, reached the garden where the gods had gathered. ||89||

Then he saw the Kevalis, the best among the sages, adorned with all virtues, possessing profound wisdom and unwavering fortitude, seated on a magnificent throne. ||90||

They radiated a brilliance surpassing that of blazing fire, possessed supreme powers, and their bodies consumed the sins of those who sought refuge in them. ||91||

They shone brightly among the gods with the brilliance of their pure knowledge, resembling the rising sun, free from the veil of clouds. ||92||

They were beloved by the moon-like kumudini flowers, or like the spotless moon itself, enveloped in the radiant aura of their bodies. ||93||

Seeing these great sages, who had just emerged from their meditation and were worshipped by all gods and demons, Rama dismounted from his elephant and approached them. ||94||

Then, Rama, the lord of householders, with a calm mind and devotion, offered his respects to the sage kings by joining his palms in reverence and circumambulating them. ||95||

The radiance of the sage kings' bodies eclipsed the brilliance of their crowns, and their cheeks were adorned with earrings that seemed to shimmer with shame. ||96||

Padmapurana
Those who had embraced the cheeks of the Jina, who had offered salutations with devotion, and who had joined their hands and touched their foreheads, such Devendras were seated there, like the human king, in a fitting manner. ||17||
The gods, adorned with various ornaments, who were of four types, appeared near the Muni-indra like the rays of the sun. ||18||
Even the king of kings, Rama, shone brightly, not very far from the Muni, like the Kalpa tree on the summit of Sumeru. ||16||
Even Lakshmana, the king, adorned with a crown and earrings, shone brightly near the Muni, like a cloud with lightning near a mountain. ||10||
Shatrughna, skilled in striking fear into the hearts of great enemies, shone brightly like the second Kubera, with a beautiful appearance. ||10||
Those two heroes, Lava and Kusha, adorned with the quiver of virtue and good fortune, and with excellent marks, shone brightly like the sun and the moon. ||10||
Even though she was devoid of external ornaments, the noble Sita, adorned only with clothes, shone brightly like the sun itself. ||103||
Then, all the humans and gods, who were desirous of hearing the Dharma, and who were adorned with humility, sat down on the earth in a fitting manner. ||104||
The Muni, Abhay-ninada by name, the chief of the group of disciples, a valiant and courageous soul, asked the Muni-punga, the best of Munis, to dispel the heat of doubt. ||105||
Then the Muni-raja spoke those words, which were very extensive, skillful, pure, revealing the true meaning, enlightening the Munis, and destroying karma. ||106||
Gautama Swami says, "At that time, the Yogi-raja spoke a secret to the learned and the great souls, which was as vast as the ocean. O Shrenika! I am only speaking a single particle of it here." ||107||
That which was spoken by the supreme Yogi, was a true statement, which was pleasing to those who had good vision and knowledge, and was desirable for the worthy beings. ||108||
He said, "This world is like two mridangas, situated in the midst of infinite space, and is situated below, in the middle, and above." ||109||
Because of this three-fold arrangement, this world is known as Triloka or diverse. There are seven lands below the Meru mountain. ||110||

## The One Hundred and Fifty-Fifth Chapter

**287**

The first of these is the **Ratnapraba** realm, where, except for its vast expanse, the upper two sections are inhabited by **Bhavana** and **Vyantara** Devas. Below the **Ratnapraba** are six more realms: **Sharkara**-praba, **Baluka**-praba, **Pank**-praba, **Dhuma**-praba, **Tama**-praba, and **Mahatama**-praba, which are all producers of great fear and are filled with intense suffering and perpetual darkness.

These realms are extremely uneven and difficult to traverse, some being as hot as molten iron, while others are filled with intense cold. They are covered in a mixture of fat and blood.

The stench of these realms is a mixture of rotting dogs, snakes, and humans, a truly foul odor.

A powerful wind blows through these realms, carrying with it the causes of various forms of suffering.

Beings who are attached to their senses of taste and touch accumulate karma that makes them heavy like lumps of iron, causing them to fall into these hells.

Those who do not refrain from violence, falsehood, theft, adultery, and attachment are born in these hells, burdened by the weight of their sins.

Humans who are constantly attached to worldly pleasures, driven by their intense karma, fall into these hells.

Beings who commit sins themselves, cause others to commit sins, and approve of sins, become prone to anger and sorrow, and are destined for hell.

Sinners are packed tightly into cells resembling caves, where they are burned by the fires of hell, emitting terrifying cries.

Driven by the fear of burning flames, the inhabitants of hell seek refuge in the **Vaitarani** river, hoping for cool water, and dive into it, abandoning their bodies.

As they dive, they are consumed by intense alkali, causing excruciating pain in their burned bodies. They then flee in terror, like deer, into the **Asipatravana** forest.

There, they gather, seeking shade, but instead find themselves torn apart by swords, arrows, discs, and spears.

They are further tormented by sharp weapons wielded by the trees of hell, which are shaken by a fierce wind.

**288**
**Padma Purana**

Those whose feet, arms, shoulders, ears, faces, eyes, and noses are cut off, and whose palates, heads, bellies, and hearts are torn apart, fall there. ||25||

Some with their legs stretched upwards are cooked in cauldrons by other powerful Narakas. Others are crushed by machines, making harsh sounds. ||126||

Some are beaten with maces by enemies filled with intense anger. They roll on the ground, overwhelmed by immense pain. ||127||

Tormented by intense thirst, the wretched Narakas, bewildered, beg for water. But instead of water, they are given melted lead and copper. ||128||

Seeing that terrible liquid, flowing from the burning embers, those thirsty Narakas tremble, their minds become confused, and their throats fill with tears. ||129||

They say, "I am not thirsty, leave me alone, I am going." But despite their unwillingness, they are forcibly made to drink that liquid. ||130||

They are thrown to the ground, crying out, and their mouths are torn open with iron rods. Poison, blood, and copper are forcibly poured into them. ||131||

That liquid burns their throats, shatters their hearts, and reaches their stomachs, exiting along with a mass of excrement. ||132||

Later, when they are filled with remorse, the guardians of the Naraka realm remind those wretched Narakas of their sins, as described by false scriptures. ||133||

They say, "At that time, you were eloquent and transgressed the Gurus, saying, 'Meat is harmless.' Where is that statement of yours now?" ||134||

"You said, 'Shraddha performed with various types of meat and alcohol is very fruitful.' Where is that statement of yours now?" ||135||

Saying this, those Narakas, filled with cruelty, kill them and feed on their own bodies. They perform extremely wretched acts. ||136||

"The state of kingship is as ephemeral as a dream." Reminding them of this, those born from them torment them with mockery, and they cry out in sorrow. ||137||

Gautama Swami says, "O King! Those beings who commit sins, in the realm of Narakas...

Therefore, knowing the unbearable fruit of unrighteousness, those with peaceful hearts, O virtuous ones, serve the Jina's teachings. ||13||

It has been known that the abode of the Ratnaprabha realm is the dwelling place of the gods. Besides this, the Devaranya forest, the ocean, and islands are also suitable places for their residence. ||14||

Earth, water, fire, air, and plants are the five stationary and one mobile, these six categories of beings are said to be. ||14||

From the difference of dharma, adharma, space, time, jiva, and pudgala, the substance is said to be sixfold, with secrets revealed by the Jinesvara. ||142||

The path of the seven-fold predication is considered the right path. The entire description of the substance is the proof, and the method is the means of its establishment. ||143||

In one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, and five-sensed beings, without any contradiction, the quality of sattva-sattva-nama exists, and it is accompanied by its opposite, the opposing element. ||144||

They should be known by the difference of subtle and gross, in relation to the body. They are also said to be two types, in relation to being sufficient and insufficient. ||145||

The difference of bhavya, abhavya, etc., in the jiva substance is also mentioned, but all these differences are only in the state of samsara, the Siddha jivas are said to be free from all these differences. ||146||

The transformation of the jiva in its knowable and visible nature, by its own power, is called use. Use is the nature of the jiva, and this use is of two types, according to the difference of knowledge and perception. ||147||

Knowledge-use is of eight types, according to the difference of mati-jnana, etc., and perception-use is of four types, according to the difference of chakshus-darshan, etc. There are two types of jivas, samsari and mukta, and samsari jivas are of two types, according to the difference of being conscious and unconscious. ||148||

Those with plant-like bodies and earth-like bodies, etc., are called stationary, the rest are called mobile. Those who are endowed with the five senses of touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing are called panchendriya. ||149||

The birth of pot-born, egg-born, and womb-born beings is said to be from the womb, and the birth of gods and hell-beings is said to be from uppaada. ||150||

The cause of birth for the rest of the beings is unconscious birth. Thus, there are different types of births, according to womb, uppaada, and unconsciousness, all accompanied by great suffering. ||151||

Even for a moment, without taking rest, they suffer the pain described above. ||138||

Therefore, O holder of peaceful hearts, O virtuous ones, knowing that "this is the unbearable fruit of unrighteousness," serve the Jina's teachings. ||136|| 

Page #308:
---------------------------
## The Padma Purana: A Translation

**Chapter 151-164**

There are three types of births, but they are all accompanied by intense suffering.

**Chapter 152**

There are five bodies: Audārika, Vaikriyika, Āhārika, Taijasa, and Kārmaṇa. These bodies are progressively more subtle.

**Chapter 153**

The Audārika, Vaikriyika, and Āhārika bodies are infinitely multiplied in terms of their regions. The Taijasa and Kārmaṇa bodies are infinitely multiplied in terms of their qualities. The Taijasa and Kārmaṇa bodies are eternally connected to the soul, meaning they have been with the soul since the beginning of time.  It is possible for a soul to have up to four of these five bodies simultaneously.

**Chapter 154**

In the Middle World, there are countless islands, starting with Jambudvipa, and countless oceans, starting with the Salt Ocean. All of these are called auspicious.

**Chapter 155**

These islands and oceans are twice the size of the previous ones, and they surround each other in a ring-like shape. Jambudvipa is located in the center.

**Chapter 156**

Jambudvipa is circular, with Mount Meru as its navel. It is one hundred thousand yojanas in diameter, and its circumference is three times that, plus a little more.

**Chapter 157-158**

There are six mountain ranges in Jambudvipa, stretching from east to west: Himavan, Mahahimavan, Nishadha, Nila, Rukmi, and Shikhari. All of these are connected to the ocean water, and they divide the regions of Jambudvipa.

**Chapter 159-160**

The region of Bharat is followed by Himavat, then Hari, then Videha, then Ramyak, then Hairanyavat, and finally Airavat. These seven regions are all located in Jambudvipa. There are also fourteen rivers in Jambudvipa, including the Ganga and the Sindhu. The description of Jambudvipa in the Dhataki Khanda and the Pushkarardha is twice as detailed.

**Chapter 161**

Humans and those who live on the Manushottara mountain live on the same side of the mountain. There are two main categories of humans: Aryas and Mlechchas. There are countless subcategories within these two categories.

**Chapter 162**

The regions of Videha, Bharat, and Airavat are the realms of karma. The regions of Devakuru, Uttarakuru, and other regions are the realms of enjoyment.

**Chapter 163**

The highest state of existence for humans is three palya, and the lowest is antarmukhurta. The highest and lowest states of existence for animals are the same as those of humans: three palya and antarmukhurta.

**Chapter 164**

There are eight types of Vyantara Devas, including Kinnaras. Their places of play are described accordingly.

**Note:** The term "Jambudvipa" is a Jain term referring to the central continent of the Jain cosmology. The term "yojana" is a unit of measurement used in ancient India.

## Chapter One Hundred and Five

**The Bright Circle of the Vyantara and Jyotisha Devas**

The Vyantara and Jyotisha Devas reside in the upper middle realm. The circle of the Jyotisha Devas is radiant and luminous, constantly circling Mount Meru, with the Sun and Moon as its kings. ||165||

**The Maha-Loka of the Kalpavasis**

Above the circle of the Jyotisha Devas, after traversing countless thousands of yojanas, lies the Maha-Loka, the abode of the Kalpavasis. ||166||

**The Sixteen Heavens of the Upper Realm**

In the Maha-Loka, there are sixteen heavens: Saudharma, Aishana, Sanatkumara, Maheindra, Brahma, Brahmottara, Lantava, Kapishtha, Shukra, Maha-Shukra, Shatara, Sahasrar, Anata, Pranata, Aran, and Achyuta. These are arranged in eight pairs. ||167-168||

**The Nine Graiveyakas**

Above these sixteen heavens are the nine Graiveyakas, where the supreme Tri-dasas reside, with Ahmi-Indra as their leader. ||169-170||

**The Five Anuttara Vimanas**

Beyond the nine Graiveyakas are the five Anuttara Vimanas: Vijay, Vaijayanta, Jayanta, Aparajita, and Sarvartha-Siddhi. ||171||

**The Siddha-Kshetra**

Above this entire three-fold realm lies the Siddha-Kshetra, a realm of extraordinary brilliance and wonder, the abode of those who have been liberated from the bonds of karma. ||172||

**The Earth of Ishta-Prag-Bhar**

Above the Siddha-Kshetra lies the auspicious Earth of Ishta-Prag-Bhar, resembling an inverted white umbrella, where the Siddha-Paramesthis reside, free from rebirth, filled with supreme bliss, and empowered by their own self-nature. ||173-174||

**The Nature of Bliss**

Rama asked the Lord, "What is the nature of the bliss experienced by those who are free from karma, liberated from the cycle of birth and death, and free from suffering?" ||175||

**The Illusion of Worldly Bliss**

The Kevali Lord replied, "The so-called bliss of this three-fold realm is merely a form of suffering, characterized by anxiety, destruction, and impermanence." ||176||

**The Bondage of Karma**

"Bound by eight types of karma, the worldly being never experiences even a moment of true happiness." ||177||

**The Obscuring Power of Karma**

"Just as a lump of gold, covered in iron, loses its natural brilliance, so too does a being, covered in karma, lose its inherent radiance." ||178||

**The Suffering of Samsara**

"The beings of this world are constantly tormented by death, birth, old age, disease, and countless mental afflictions. What happiness is there here?" ||179||

**The False Delights of the Senses**

"The pleasures of the senses are like the sweetness of honey on a poisoned arrow. They are like the fragrance of sandalwood mixed with poison." ||180|| 

Page #310:
---------------------------
##  Chapter 212 of the Padma Purana

**18.** The bliss of the Siddhas is described as being beyond comparison, free from all suffering, and inherent to their nature.

**182.** What is the use of sleep for those who have lost their sleep? What is the use of medicine for the healthy? What is the use of lamps and the sun for the omniscient and those who have achieved their goals?

**183.** What is the use of weapons for those who are fearless and free from enemies? What is the use of striving for those who see everything fulfilled?

**184.** What is the use of food and drink for those who are content with the supreme bliss? Even the Indra, the king of the gods, constantly desires the bliss of the Siddhas.

**185.** Although there is no true comparison for this bliss, I will speak about it to enlighten you about the bliss of the Siddhas.

**186.** The bliss enjoyed by the Chakravartis, the Indras, and all the gods, even for an infinite period, cannot even come close to the bliss of the Siddhas, who are free from karma.

**187.** The bliss of the Siddhas is incomparable, even to the bliss of the inhabitants of the infinite universes.

**188.** Kings are happier than ordinary people, Chakravartis are happier than kings, Vyantara Devas are happier than Chakravartis, Jyotish Devas are happier than Vyantara Devas.

**189.** Bhavanavasi Devas are happier than Jyotish Devas, Kalpavasis are happier than Bhavanavasi Devas, Graiveyakavasis are happier than Kalpavasis, and Anuttaravasis are happier than Graiveyakavasis.

**190.** And the Siddhas, who are infinitely more blissful than the Anuttaravasis, are the most blissful of all. There is no bliss greater than the bliss of the Siddhas.

**160.** Infinite perception, infinite knowledge, infinite power, and infinite bliss - these four are the inherent nature of the soul, and they exist in the Siddhas.

**161.** However, these same qualities in worldly beings are different due to the difference in the cessation of their karma, and they are manifested in various ways due to external objects.

**162.** The happiness derived from the objects of the senses, such as sound, is like a wound filled with thorns, caused by the pain of disease. Therefore, the hope for happiness in the body is a delusion.

**163.** The Siddhas, who are free from coming and going, whose all afflictions are destroyed, and who are the crown of the world, enjoy incomparable bliss.

**180.** The sweetness of honey is like a wound, the bliss of heaven is like sandalwood paste on a burnt wound, and the bliss of a Chakravarti is like food mixed with poison.

**181.** But the bliss of the Siddha Bhagavans is eternal, supreme, free from suffering, incomparable, and born of the nature of the soul. 

**Note:** This translation preserves the Jain terms "Siddha," "Chakravarti," "Vyantara Deva," "Jyotish Deva," "Bhavanavasi Deva," "Kalpavasis," "Graiveyakavasis," and "Anuttaravasis."

Chapter One Hundred and Five

If their vision and knowledge illuminate the world and the beyond, they cannot be compared to the sun, which illuminates only the small things. (13)

The knowledge of a person who is able to know all the parts of a myrobalan fruit in his hand is not equal to the knowledge of a Siddha. (16)

A Kevali is equal in all states, in all three periods of time. He is endowed with knowledge and vision, and there is no other like him. (17)

Just as there is a difference between the knowledge and vision of Siddhas and ordinary beings, so too there is a difference between their happiness and their strength. (168)

Only a Kevali knows the true nature of the vision, knowledge, and happiness of Siddhas. The words of others are merely analogies. (16)

This abode of the Jina, the state of a Siddha, is unattainable by the Abhyavya, even if they strive with all their might and inflict great pain on their bodies. (200)

For they are bound by the endless cycle of time and are constantly embraced by the ignorance that is their companion, never leaving them. (201)

Those who are eager to embrace the woman of liberation, the Bhavyas, spend their days in austerity, enduring great hardship. (202)

Those who are devoid of the power of liberation are called Abhyavya, while those who will attain liberation are called Bhavyas. (203)

The Kevali, the All-Embellished, says, "O Raghunandan, even with all effort, there is no destruction of karma in any other path than the path of the Jina." (204)

The ignorant being destroys karma over countless lifetimes, while the knower destroys it in a single moment with the three secrets. (205)

This is known throughout the world: the true nature of the Nir-anjan, the spotless Supreme Being, is seen only by those whose karma is destroyed. (206)

Many have grasped the path of the world, which is devoid of essence. To attain the ultimate truth, embrace the path of the Jina. (207)

Thus, hearing the words of the All-Embellished, Sri Rama bowed and said, "O Lord, save us from this ocean of existence." (208)

Page #312:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
It is asked: "How are the noble beings, who are of three types - inferior, mediocre, and superior - liberated from the cycle of birth and death?" || 206 ||
The Lord, the embodiment of right faith, knowledge, and conduct, said: "The path to liberation is described in the Jain scriptures as the unity of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct." || 210 ||
"Faith in the principles is called right faith. The principle, which is the essence of all, is of two types: conscious and unconscious, and has infinite qualities and permutations." || 211 ||
"One who, through the door of natural understanding, accepts the principle with devotion, is called a right-seeing being, devoted to the Jain faith." || 212 ||
"Doubt, desire, uncertainty, praise of other doctrines, and criticizing noble people by pointing out their faults are the five transgressions of right faith." || 213 ||
"Stability, delight in the abode of the Jinas, noble thoughts, and freedom from doubt and other faults are the means of purifying right faith." || 214 ||
"Conduct that is performed with right knowledge, according to the principles laid down by the omniscient, by a person who has conquered his senses, is called right conduct." || 215 ||
"Right conduct is that which is free from sin, where the senses are controlled, and speech and mind are restrained." || 216 ||
"Right conduct is that which involves non-violence towards all living beings, both mobile and immobile, in accordance with the principles of justice." || 217 ||
"Right conduct is that which involves speaking words that are pleasing to the mind and ears, affectionate, sweet, meaningful, and beneficial." || 218 ||
"Right conduct is that which involves refraining from taking what is not given, in thought, word, and deed, and accepting only what is rightfully given." || 219 ||
"Right conduct is that which involves observing celibacy, which is revered even by the gods and difficult to maintain even for great men." || 220 ||
"Right conduct is that which involves renouncing possessions, with the abandonment of fainting spells, which are great obstacles on the path to liberation." || 221 ||
"Right conduct is that which involves giving charity to those who have renounced the world, which is free from harming others and is accompanied by faith and other virtues." || 222 ||

Page #313:
---------------------------
**Chapter One Hundred and Five**

**Right Conduct**

**223.**  Vಿನಯ, ನಿಯಮ, ಶೀಲ, ಜ್ಞಾನ, ದಯ, ದಮ, and meditation for liberation, when these are present, it is called Right Conduct.

**224.**  This Right Conduct, endowed with these qualities, as spoken by the Jinas, is to be followed for the attainment of liberation, the highest good.

**225.**  A being with Right Faith can do what is possible, and refrains from what is impossible. A being with Right Faith and Right Knowledge is capable of following Right Conduct.

**226.**  Where these great qualities are not present, there is no Right Conduct, and no escape from the cycle of birth and death.

**227.**  Where there is no compassion, self-control, or forgiveness, there is no restraint, no knowledge, no renunciation, and no religion.

**228.**  Where violence, falsehood, theft, lust, and attachment are practiced in the name of religion, there is no religion.

**229.**  One who, after taking initiation, indulges in sin with a foolish mind, has neither Right Conduct nor liberation.

**230.**  Where the suffering of the six categories of living beings is inflicted for the sake of pleasure under the guise of religion, liberation is not attained.

**231.**  What is the initiation of one who is attached to villages, fields, etc., and who engages in killing, beating, binding, torturing, and exploiting?

**232.**  What liberation can a wicked, initiated person attain who is attached to buying and selling, cooks his own food, or begs, and keeps gold and other possessions?

**233.**  Those who, after initiation, indulge in massage, bathing, rituals, garlands, incense, and ointments, are not liberated.

**234.**  Those who, out of their own intellect, declare violence to be free from fault, and who criticize the scriptures, the way of life, and conduct, are fools.

**235.**  One who stays in a village for one night, in a city for five nights, keeps his arms raised constantly, eats once a month, sleeps in the forest with the deer, wanders with them, performs the Bhrigu-pāt, remains silent, and renounces possessions, is a Kuliṅga, contaminated by false views.

**236.**  One who is contaminated by false views, a Kuliṅga, devoid of the seed of liberation, cannot reach the abode of liberation even by walking. 

Page #314:
---------------------------
## The Pabhapurana:

**238.** The foolish soul, clinging to the path of Dharma, commits sins like entering fire or water, and thus falls into misery, not understanding his own good.

**239.** The one who is attached to fierce and sorrowful meditation, who is not victorious over desire, who performs evil deeds, and whose actions are contrary to the right path, will experience a condemned fate.

**240.** Even if one with a false view gives charity to the virtuous and the wicked, guided by the Dharma, he binds himself to the karma that brings great prosperity.

**241.** Even though such a being enjoys the fruits of his Dharma in heaven, it is not even a fraction of the reward that comes with attaining Right Faith.

**242.** Those who possess the exalted Right Faith and are devoted to good conduct are praised in this world and become prominent in the heavenly realms after death.

**243.** Even with great effort, the one with a false view, a Kuliṅga, becomes a servant of the gods and receives only a meager reward.

**244.** The one with Right Faith, having enjoyed the pleasures of being a human and a god in seven or eight lifetimes, attains liberation by embracing the life of a monk.

**245.** The one who is deluded by worldly objects does not desire to follow the path shown by the liberated, the all-knowing.

**246.** Bound by the strong chains of desire, deeply engrossed in delusion, they are brought into the house of thirst, carrying the chains of sin.

**247.** Various beings, clinging to the pleasures and pains of taste and touch, suffer greatly, having abandoned their refuge.

**248.** "He fears death, but does not attain liberation. He constantly desires happiness, but does not achieve it."

**249.** Thus, controlled by futile fear and desire, this being, devoid of any means, only experiences suffering.

**250.** Always consumed by desire, he seeks to enjoy pleasures, but does not perform any Dharma, just like a mosquito does not care for gold.

Chapter One Hundred and Five
217
Tormented by the fire of afflictions, this being is eager to begin many actions. He does not attain any purpose, and even the happiness he has is lost. ||25||
This being, due to past sins, does not attain the desired object of his mind. Instead, he attains great and insurmountable misfortune. ||252||
"I have done this, I am doing this, and I will do this." Thus, a man resolves, but never considers that he will die. ||253||
Death does not wait to see what a being has done or not done. It attacks at an inopportune time, just as a lion attacks a deer. ||254||
Alas! The deluded beings consider the harmful as beneficial, suffering as happiness, the impermanent as permanent, the fearful as refuge, the beneficial as harmful, happiness as suffering, the protector as the destroyer, and the stable as unstable. It has to be said that the conduct of the deluded beings is different. ||255-256||
This man, like a wild elephant, is bound by the fetters of his wife, or like a fish, is attached to the bait of worldly objects, and thus experiences bondage. ||257||
Stuck in the vast ocean of delusion, filled with the mud of family, this being, like a weak ox, struggles and suffers. ||258||
A bound man can be freed from a blind well, but a being bound by the fetters of attachment is freed with great difficulty. ||259||
The knowledge of the Jina, which is very rare even in the human world, is not attainable by an abhyavi. Similarly, the path of the three jewels, as taught by the Jina, is not attainable by an abhyavi. ||260||
Marked by the stain of heavy karmas, the abhyavi beings are constantly riding the wheel of samsara, carrying the burden of afflictions. ||261||
Then, folding his hands and bowing his head, Rama said, "O Bhagavan! Am I a bhavi? And by what means will I be liberated?" ||262||
"I am capable of abandoning this earth, along with my inner palace, but I am not capable of abandoning even a single act of kindness done by Lakshmana." ||263||
I am like a ship, adrift in the waves of attachment, clinging to the fragments of worldly objects. O Muniśvara, grant me the support of your grace. ||264||
This being does not possess patience in the Dharma. ||250||

In the Padma Purana,
The Lord said, "O Rama, you should not grieve. You are destined to enjoy the wealth of Baldeva. Just as Indra obtains the royal fortune of heaven, so too, by obtaining the royal fortune here, you will ultimately receive the initiation of Jinesvara and attain the state of liberation, which is full of knowledge. "
Hearing the words of the Kevali, Rama, whose hair stood on end with great joy, whose eyes were wide open, who was handsome and whose face was radiant, became filled with fortitude, happiness, and contentment.
Gautama Swami says that all the gods, demons, and humans there were astonished and amazed to know that Rama was a final body. With great joy, they praised the truth revealed by the sun-like Kevali.
Thus ends the one hundred and fifth chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the Arsha, narrated by the Acharya Ravishena, which describes the hearing of Rama's Dharma.

1.  One hundred and six chapters, Vrishabha, the ornament of the celestial beings, Vibhishana, adorned with devotion to him.  The great ornament of the fearless, Vrishabha, the garment of the sky dwellers.
2.  He, with his hands like great lotuses, the best of those who bear a body, having bowed down, asked the wise one, adorned with all ornaments.
3.  O Lord, what good deed did this Rama do in a previous birth, by which he has attained such greatness?
4.  His wife, the virtuous Sita, who was living in the Dandaka forest, was abducted by Ravana due to what karmic fault?
5.  Ravana knew all the scriptures concerning dharma, artha, kama, and moksha, he knew the distinction between right and wrong, and was wise in matters of dharma and adharma.
6.  Though endowed with excellent qualities, he, being under the sway of delusion, became like a moth, attracted to the fire of lust for another's wife.
7.  How did Lakshmana, who was extremely devoted to his brother, and who was wandering in the forest, kill him in battle?
8.  Ravana, who was so powerful, the king of the Vidyadharas, and who had performed many wonders, how did he come to such a death?
9.  Then the voice of the Kevali, the knower of all, spoke, saying that in this world, Rama and Lakshmana had a deep-seated enmity with Ravana for many births.
10.  In this Jambudvipa, in the Bharat Kshetra, there was a city called Kshetra, where there lived a merchant named Nayadatta, who was a man of ordinary wealth.
11.  He had a son named Dhanadatta, born of his wife Sunanda, who was the soul of Rama.  His second son was named Vasudatta, who was the soul of Lakshmana.  A Brahmin named Yajnavalli was a friend of Vasudeva, and he was the soul of you, Vibhishana.
12.  In the same city, there lived another merchant named Sagardatta.  His wife's name was Ratnapraba, and they had a daughter named Gunavati, who was the soul of Sita.
13.  She, Gunavati, was endowed with beauty, youth, grace, radiance, and a charming demeanor.  She had a younger brother named Gunavan, who had a beautiful mind.

## Chapter One Hundred and Six

Two [beings] were born as boars, then as buffaloes, cows, monkeys, leopards, wolves, and blackbucks. They killed each other in all these forms. ||28||

They were always eager to follow their hatred, whether in water or on land. They were always killing each other in this way, being engaged in evil deeds. ||29||

Then, Dhanadatta, exhausted from the journey and deeply distressed, reached the hermitage of the monks one day when the sun had set. ||30||

Thirsty, he said to the monks, "I am very distressed, please give me water. You are fond of doing good deeds." ||31||

One of the monks, comforting him with sweet words, said, "Even nectar is not proper to drink at night, let alone water." ||32||

"My dear, do not eat when the eyes cease their function, which is a time of great evil, filled with unseen, subtle beings, and when the sun is absent." ||33||

"O Blessed one, even when you are distressed, you should not eat at an inappropriate time. Do not fall into the ocean of the world, filled with the bitter water of suffering." ||34||

Then, calmed by the stories of the monks' virtues, he became a follower of the Anuvrata, his mind filled with compassion. He was not able to become a follower of the Mahavratas because he was of limited strength. ||35||

When his time came, he died and attained the heaven of Saudharma, adorned with a crown, earrings, bracelets, garlands, and a signet ring, a glorious god. ||36||

There, due to the merit of his past deeds, he was delighted by the pleasures of the celestial nymphs, surrounded by a large family of Apsaras, and enjoyed himself like Indra. ||37||

Then, he was born in the great city of Mahapur, as the son of a wealthy Jain merchant named Meru, and his mother was Dharini. ||38||

In the same city, there was a king named Chhatracchaya. His queen was named Shridatta, who was a treasure trove of queenly virtues. ||39||

One day, Padmaruchi was riding on horseback, returning to his Gokul, when he saw a worn-out bull lying on the ground. ||40||

**Notes:**

* **Anuvrata:** A set of lesser vows in Jainism.
* **Mahavratas:** The five great vows in Jainism.

In the Padma Purana, 
Padmaruchi, adorned with fragrant garments and garlands, dismounted from his horse and approached the ox with compassion and respect. ||41|| 
As he chanted the Panchanamaskara mantra into the ox's ear, the ox's soul departed from its body, having heard the mantra. ||42|| 
Due to the influence of the mantra, Padmaruchi was born as the son of Queen Shridatta, the wife of King Chatrachchhaya, whose karma-jāl (web of karma) had lessened. Chatrachchhaya was overjoyed at the birth of his son, as he had no children before. ||43|| 
The city was adorned with great splendor, and a grand festival was held with music and festivities. ||44|| 
Then, due to the influence of his past karma, Padmaruchi remembered his previous birth as an ox. He recalled the unbearable suffering he had endured carrying burdens, enduring heat and cold, and the pain of his feet. He also remembered the opportunity he had received to hear the Panchanamaskara mantra. Despite being engrossed in childhood games, he always kept the memory of hearing the mantra in his mind. ||45-46|| 
One day, while wandering, he reached the place where the ox had died. He recognized each place he had visited in his previous life. ||47|| 
Then, the prince, named Vrishabhadhwaja, dismounted from his elephant and, with a heavy heart, gazed at the place where the ox had died for a long time. ||48|| 
When he could not see the wise Padmaruchi, the giver of the jewel of Samadhi-death and the one with excellent deeds, he pondered how to find him. ||49|| 
Then, he built a Jain temple on that very spot, resembling the peak of Mount Kailasa. He had the stories of the great men and the Puranas inscribed on tablets and paintings within the temple. ||50|| 
At the entrance of the temple, he had a painting depicting his previous birth, and he stationed clever men near it to test people. ||51|| 
Then, with a desire to pay homage, Padmaruchi went to the temple one day and...

Chapter Sixty-Six

53. As he gazed at the picture, the servants of Vrishadhvaja informed him of the conversation. 

54. Then, the prince, endowed with great wealth, mounted his excellent elephant and came there, desiring to meet the sage.

55. Dismounting from the elephant, he entered the Jina temple and saw Dharinisuta Padmaruchi, who was intently gazing at the picture.

56. Recognizing Padmaruchi, whose eyes, face, and hands expressed great wonder, Vrishadhvaja bowed at his feet.

57. Padmaruchi told him of the bull's sorrowful death, and the prince, with tearful eyes, said, "That bull was I."

58. As a good disciple rejoices in honoring his teacher, so Vrishadhvaja, the prince, quickly honored Padmaruchi and was pleased.

59. After the honor, the prince said to Padmaruchi, "At that time, when I was surrounded by the danger of death, you came to me like a dear friend and enabled me to attain Samadhi."

60. "You, compassionate one, gave me the support of Samadhi, the nectar of liberation. See, I have attained this existence, satisfied by that."

61. "Neither my mother, nor my father, nor my brother, nor my relatives, nor the gods have done for me what you have done."

62. "Though I do not see the value of the gift of the five prostrations and the hearing of the scriptures, yet my supreme devotion to you compels me to do this."

63. "O Lord, command me, tell me what I should do for you. O Supreme Being, by giving me a command, grace me, your devotee."

64. "Take this entire kingdom, I will be your servant. Employ this body in whatever work is beneficial."

65. Thus, with such excellent words, great love arose between them. They both attained Samyaktva, the kingdom became theirs jointly, and their association became eternal.

66. Their affection, not merely superficial, but reaching to their bones and marrow, made them both followers of the Shravaka vows. Steadfast in their minds, they both stood firm on the earth, worshipping the Jina images and the shrines.

**Verse 66:**  He built many Jain temples and images of the Jinas.

**Verse 67:**  He adorned the earth hundreds of times with stupas resembling white lotus buds.

**Verse 68:**  After that, at the time of death, he worshipped the Samadhi and became a god in the Ishana realm, enjoying the fruits of his virtuous deeds.

**Verse 69:**  The brilliance of his eyes was like the blossoming lotus of the celestial women, and all his desires were fulfilled as he played in meditation.

**Verse 70:**  In due time, Padma-ruchi also attained Samadhi-death and became a beautiful Vimana-deva in the Ishana heaven.

**Verse 71:**  After that, his soul migrated from there to the Vijayachala mountain in the western Videha region, and was born as Nayana-ananda, the son of King Nandi-ishvara of Nandya-varta city, and Queen Kanaka-bha. There, he enjoyed the immense wealth of the king of the celestial beings for a long time.

**Verse 72-73:**  Then, he embraced the life of a monk, performed extremely difficult austerities, and finally attained Samadhi-death, reaching the Mahendra heaven.

**Verse 74:**  There, he enjoyed the most beautiful and delightful pleasures through the five senses, which were like the great fruits of the vine of merit.

**Verse 75:**  After that, he migrated from there to the city of Kshema, situated in the eastern part of Mount Meru, and was born as a famous prince named Shri-chandra.

**Verse 76:**  His mother was Padmavati and his father was Vipula-vahana. There, he enjoyed the remaining residue of the karma he had accumulated in heaven.

**Verse 77:**  Due to the influence of his merit, his treasury, kingdom, and military forces were constantly growing in all directions.

**Verse 78:**  Shri-chandra, who was like the ruler of a village, ruled over a vast earth with various treasures, cherishing it like a beloved.

**Verse 79:**  He was nurtured by beautiful women with charming gestures, and played like Indra, surrounded by celestial women.

**Verse 80:**  Like the Dodunduka deva, he possessed great wealth and power, and thousands of years passed for him like a moment.

**Verse 81:**  Then, at some point, he was surrounded by a large and powerful assembly of those who practiced vows and secrecy, and who were superior in their devotion to the Samadhi.

When the people of the city learned that the Muni was staying in the garden, they all went there with great joy, eager to pay their respects. ||2||
Hearing the sound of the multitude of devotees, which was like the roar of a cloud, Sri Chandra listened intently and asked those nearby, "Whose sound is this, which is like the ocean?" ||3||
Those who were asked by the king did not know the cause of the sound, so they brought the minister to the king. ||4||
The king then asked the minister, "Find out whose sound this is." The minister went, learned the truth, and returned to inform the king. ||85||
Then, with his eyes shining like blooming lotuses, and his body trembling with joy, the king, along with his wife, set out to pay his respects to the Muni. ||86||
Seeing the Muni, whose face was like the moon, the king bowed his head in reverence and sat down on the ground in humility. ||87||
Seeing the Muni, who was like the sun to the lotus of his mind, the king felt a great love that was beyond words. ||88||
Then, the Muni, who was deeply learned in all the scriptures, gave a discourse on the truth to the vast multitude. ||89||
He said that there are two types of Dharma, the Anāgāra and the Sāgāra, both of which are full of many different aspects and lead to liberation from the cycle of birth and death. ||90||
The Muni, who was the best of speakers, explained the four aspects of the Anuyoginī: 1) Prathamānuyoga, 2) Karaṇānuyoga, 3) Caraṇānuyoga, and 4) Dravyānuyoga. ||91||
Then, he spoke of the Ākṣepaṇī, which criticizes other views, and the Nikṣepaṇī, which explains his own truth. Then, he spoke of the Samvejanī, which inspires fear of the world, and the Nivedanī, which inspires detachment from worldly pleasures and leads to virtue. ||92-93||
He said that for a being who is running through the cycle of birth and death, liberation can only be attained through great effort and through the practice of Karma Yoga. ||94||

The Padma Purana says:

15. This world is like twilight, bubbles, foam, waves, lightning, and a rainbow. There is no essence in it.

36. This being experiences only suffering in hell or the animal realm, and it is not satisfied with the happiness of humans and gods.

17. How can one who is not satisfied with the wealth of Indra's pleasures be satisfied with the petty pleasures of humans?

18. Just as a foolish man, having obtained a treasure, becomes careless and loses it, so too, this being, having obtained the rare human birth, becomes careless due to the desire for the taste of worldly pleasures and loses its human birth.

16. What is the satisfaction of fire with dry fuel? What is the satisfaction of the ocean with river water? And what is the satisfaction of this embodied being with the pleasures of the taste of worldly objects?

10. Like a man drowning in water, a clever man, deluded by the bait of worldly objects, becomes blind to wisdom and falls into foolishness.

10. The sun shines only during the day, but lust burns day and night. The sun has a covering, but lust has no covering.

102. In this world, birth, death, old age, and suffering, arising from continuous karma, are like the wheel of an oil press, and they are frightening to remember.

103. Just as an inanimate machine is moved by a living being, so too, this impermanent and foul body is moved by the soul. The attachment to this body is due to delusion.

10. Knowing that this human birth is as insubstantial as a water bubble, noble souls become detached and take refuge in the path revealed by the Jinas.

105. Those who are covered with the armor of enthusiasm, who ride on the horse of determination, and who wield the sword of meditation, are the brave and wise who set out for liberation.

106. O humans! Be certain that the body is separate and I am separate, and give up attachment to the body and practice Dharma.

107. Those who consider happiness and suffering to be equal, who see no difference between friends and strangers, and who are free from attachment and aversion, are the true monks, the best of men.

10. Their...

1. 'Just as an inanimate machine is moved by a living being, so too, the body, which is foul and decaying, is moved by the soul. Attachment to this body is futile, so you should know this as the truth.' - From the Brihatsvayambu Stotra, in praise of Samantabhadra.

## The Hundredth Chapter of the Parsvanatha Purva

**307**

Hearing the Muni's words, Shri Chandra, having taken refuge in enlightenment, turned away from the pleasures of worldly objects. ||10||

Giving his kingdom to his only son, the great-minded one, he took the vows of a Shraman near Samadhi Gupta Nath. ||11||

United with right faith, he was a yogi, possessing purity, endowed with samitis and guptis, free from attachment and aversion. ||111||

Adorned with the three jewels, he was united with virtues like truthfulness, etc., he was full of the Jain teachings, a Shraman, well-established in meditation. ||112||

He was the foundation of the five great vows, a protector of beings, free from the seven fears, endowed with supreme fortitude. ||113||

He was devoted to good conduct, a bearer of hardships, a Muni, who performed the purificatory fasts of the sixth, eighth, and other months. ||114||

His mind was absorbed in meditation and study, he was free from ego, a conqueror of the senses, free from the desire for future enjoyments, he was supremely peaceful, and a great devotee of the teachings. ||115||

He was skilled in non-violent conduct, devoted to the welfare of the monastic order, free from desire even for a single hair of a child. ||116||

His body was adorned with the dust of his unwashed feet, he was free from attachment, a Digambara, he stayed for one night in a village and five nights in a city. ||117||

His abode was in the caves of mountains, on the banks of rivers, or in beautiful gardens, he had renounced attachment to his body, he was steadfast, silent, learned, and devoted to right austerities. ||118||

Having thus acquired these virtues, Shri Chandra, having worn out the cage of karma, attained the time of his liberation and became the lord of the Brahma world. ||119||

There, in his supreme abode, he was endowed with splendor, fame, brilliance, and radiance, he was illuminated by the jewel on his head, and renowned throughout the three worlds. ||120||

Although he sported with the supreme powers born of meditation, he remained detached, like Indra, the king of the gods, or like the emperor Bharata. ||121||

In Nandana and other gardens, the gods of the Saudharma heaven, endowed with great wealth, stood waiting for him, their minds filled with longing. ||122||

The Munis, with their eyes of pure meditation, have burnt to ashes the vast forest of karma, filled with wild animals of suffering. ||108||

Thus, hearing the teachings of the Muni, Shri Chandra turned away from the pleasures of worldly objects and attained the three jewels. ||109||

As a result, the generous-hearted one, gave his kingdom to his son, Dhritikanta, and took the vows of a Muni near Samadhi Gupta Nath. ||110||

Now, Shri Chandra Muni was united with appropriate faith, he possessed the purity of the three yogas, he was endowed with samitis and guptis, and he was free from attachment and aversion. ||111||

He was adorned with the three jewels, he was united with virtues like forgiveness, etc., he was full of the Jain teachings, a Shraman, and well-established in meditation. ||112||

He was the foundation of the five great vows, a protector of beings, free from the seven fears, and endowed with supreme fortitude. ||113||

He was devoted to good conduct, a bearer of hardships, a Muni, who performed the purificatory fasts of the sixth, eighth, and other months. ||114||

His mind was absorbed in meditation and study, he was free from ego, a conqueror of the senses, free from the desire for future enjoyments, he was supremely peaceful, and a great devotee of the teachings. ||115||

He was skilled in non-violent conduct, devoted to the welfare of the monastic order, and free from desire even for a single hair of a child. ||116||

His body was adorned with the dust of his unwashed feet, he was free from attachment, a Digambara, he stayed for one night in a village and five nights in a city. ||117||

His abode was in the caves of mountains, on the banks of rivers, or in beautiful gardens, he had renounced attachment to his body, he was steadfast, silent, learned, and devoted to right austerities. ||118||

Thus, Shri Chandra Muni, having acquired these virtues, wore out the cage of karma, attained the time of his liberation, and became the lord of the Brahma world. ||119||

There, in his supreme abode, he was endowed with splendor, fame, brilliance, and radiance, he was illuminated by the jewel on his head, and renowned throughout the three worlds. ||120||

Although he sported with the supreme powers born of meditation, he remained detached, like Indra, the king of the gods, or like the emperor Bharata. ||121||

Padma Purana
He delighted in a divine chariot adorned with jewels and a net of pearls, a spectacle for the eyes of divine women. ||23||
O Vibhishana, even Brihaspati could not describe the glory of this Sri Chandra's living Brahma, even in a hundred years. ||124||
This supreme jewel, this unparalleled secret, is manifest in the three worlds, but the foolish do not know the Jain teachings. ||125||
Having learned the greatness of the Muni Dharma and the Jina, those who are deluded by false pride turn away from the Dharma. ||126||
The child, the ignorant one, who delights in the pleasures of this world, even while taking care of himself, does harm to himself, which even an enemy would not do. ||127||
Because of the complexity of karma-bandha, not everyone becomes a holder of the three jewels. Even some, having obtained them, abandon them again due to dependence on others. ||128||
O noble ones, do not delight in the Dharma that is condemned, embraced by many wicked people and full of faults. Be kind to your own nature. ||129||
There is no liberation from suffering outside the Jain teachings. Therefore, O noble ones, with undivided devotion, constantly worship the Jinas. ||130||
Thus, the story of Dhanadatta, who attained the human state from the state of the gods, and the state of the gods from the human state, is narrated. ||131||
Now, I will briefly describe the wanderings of Vasudatta, etc., who, due to the complexity of karma, assume various forms. ||132||
Then, in the city of Mrinalakunda, there lived a king named Vijayasen, powerful and radiant with glory. His wife was Ratna Chula. ||133||
They had a son named Vajrakambu, and his wife was Hemvati. They had a son named Shambhu, famous in the world. ||134||
His chief priest was Sribhuthi, a seer of the ultimate truth, and his wife was Saraswati, endowed with excellent qualities. ||135||
The virtuous woman, whom I have mentioned before, was for a long time in the lower realms, deprived of the right Dharma due to the influence of her karma. ||136||

Even though my father has passed away, I will not abandon his wishes. It is better to die than to desire a man of false vision. ||15||
Having gone to the Harikanta Aryika with great enthusiasm, she took the vows and performed extremely difficult austerities. ||152||
Her hair stood on end, and her body became so dry from the austerities that it seemed as if there was no flesh left, only bones and veins were visible. ||153||
At the end of her life, she attained the Brahma heaven and enjoyed the pleasures of the gods, obtained through her good deeds. ||154||
Without Vedavati, Shambhu became completely destitute in the world. He lost his brothers, servants, and Lakshmi, and became a deranged fool. ||155||
He was filled with false pride and turned away from the words of the Jinas. He mocked the monks and spoke harshly to them. ||156||
Shambhu, who consumed honey, meat, and liquor, and was eager to approve of sins, wandered for a long time in the hells and animal realms, experiencing intense suffering. ||157||
Then, due to some lessening of his sinful karma, a son was born to Savitri, the wife of the Kushadhvaja Brahmin. ||158||
His name was Prabhasakunda. He obtained the three precious jewels and took initiation from the Muni Vichitra Sena. ||159||
He was free from lust, pride, anger, and envy. He was compassionate and had conquered his senses. He performed austerities without any attachment. ||160||
He fasted for two days, three days, and one night, and had given up all desires. He stayed in desolate forests, where the sun sets. ||161||
He was endowed with good qualities and character, and was a great bearer of hardships. In the summer, he was eager to bask in the sun, wearing a garment made of dirt. In the rainy season, he would get drenched under the trees by the rain. In the winter, he would stay on the banks of rivers, covered in a garment of snow. ||162-163||
Thus, engaged in such practices, Prabhasakunda once went to the Siddha Kshetra, Sammed Shikhar, to pay his respects, remembering the destruction of his sins. ||164||

The glorious one, known as Kanakaprabha, saw the prosperity of the learned ones there. Even though he was peaceful, he was still moved by the waves in the sky. ||165||

Enough of this talk of wealth, I need liberation. If there is any greatness in my austerities, I will attain such sovereignty. ||166||

Oh, look at the foolishness born from evil deeds! He sold a jewel, priceless in the three worlds, for a handful of greens. ||167||

At the time of their rise, they prosper, and at the time of their decline, they fall. What can anyone do here, due to the influence of their karma? ||168||

His soul, tainted by the nidāna, performed extremely severe austerities. He ascended to the heaven of Sanatkumara and enjoyed pleasures there. ||169||

Fallen from there due to the remnants of his good deeds, his mind was consumed by the memory of pleasures. He was born as Ravana, the son of Ratnashrava and his wife Kaikesi in the city of Lanka. ||170||

There, according to the nidāna, he attained that great sovereignty, whose actions were extremely luxurious, in which great wonders were performed, and which had spread throughout the world with its prowess. ||171||

That one, who was the lord of the Brahma-loka, after staying there for a time equal to ten oceans, fell and was born as Rama, the son of Dasharatha. His mother was Aparajita. Due to the remnants of his past good deeds, a man equal to Rama in prosperity, form, and valor is rare in the world. ||172-173||

That one, who was previously Dhanadatta, became this beautiful Rama, who, with his fame, has filled the world like the moon. ||174||

That one, who was previously Vasudatta, then became the Brahmin Sribhuti, and in turn, became this Lakshmana, the embodiment of the Narayana-pada, the tree for the vine of Lakshmi. ||175||

That one, who was previously Srikanta, became Shiva in due course, then Prabhasakunda, and now Ravana. ||176||

He is Ravana, who subdued the entire three parts of the Bharat-kshetra, as if they were held in the grip of his fingers. ||177||

She, who was previously Gunavati, then became Sribhuti's daughter in due course. She was born as Sita, the daughter of King Janaka. ||178||

He who, upon being remembered, destroys sin. ||162-164||

Meghadutta was a follower of the Anuvrata, always devoted to the worship of the Jina, and a worshiper of the Jina temples. At the end of his life, he died in meditation and was born in the Aishan heaven. ||189||
In the eastern region of Videha, on the island of Jambudvipa, near the city of Vijayavati, there is a beautiful village called Mattakokila, where there is constant celebration and which is as beautiful as a city. The lord of that village was Kantashoka, and his wife was Ratnakini. Meghadutta's soul, after falling from the Aishan heaven, was born as their beautiful son named Suprabha. This Suprabha was surrounded by many relatives and loved good conduct. ||190-192||
He obtained the three jewels of the Jina path, which are rare in the world, and accepted the vows of a monk, following the great sage Samyata. ||193||
The daughter of the priest, Vedavati, became the wife of Janak, the king, and was known as Sita. ||178||
This Sita was the virtuous wife of Baldeva-Rama, a treasure of good conduct, and as beautiful as Sachi, the wife of Indra, in her actions. ||179||
At that time, the brother of Gunavati, who was virtuous, became Bhamandala, the close friend of Langala. ||180||
When Amritavati Devi, a resident of Brahmaloka, fell from her abode, Kundalamandita also fell at the same time. ||18||
The union of these two souls took place in the womb of Videha, the queen of Janak. This brother-sister pair was extremely beautiful and flawless. ||181-182||
The one who was previously Yajnavalli, the Brahmin, became Vibhishan, and the one who was Vrishabhaketu became Sugriva, the one with the banner of the monkey. ||183||
Thus, you all, due to your past affection and the influence of your good deeds, became devoted to Rama, the one with pure actions. ||184||
Gautama Swami says, "O Shrenik! After this, Vibhishan asked the omniscient about his past life as a child. The omniscient explained it, and I will tell you now, so listen." ||185||
In this world of four paths, filled with the multitude of sorrows like attachment, aversion, etc., there lived a black deer in the forest of Vrindavan. ||186||
At the end of his life, that

Thus, the great sage Supriya, with a noble mind and vast heart, performed severe austerities for many thousands of years, according to the rules. ||14||

Even though he was endowed with various attainments, he did not become proud. He also renounced all attachment to the feelings arising from association. ||15||

The great sage, who had attained the first stage of white meditation, which is the state of the cessation of passions, would have attained the state of Siddha, but his lifespan was not long enough. Therefore, he attained the state of सर्वार्थसिद्धि (perfection in all aspects) in the same state of cessation. ||16||

After enjoying great happiness for thirty-three oceans of years, he was born as Vali, the powerful king of the Vidyadharas. ||17||

He obtained a kingdom filled with various treasures on the Kishkindha mountain. His brother, Sugriva, was endowed with great virtues. ||18||

Even though he was in great conflict with the king of Lanka, Ravana, he renounced his claim to the kingdom for the sake of compassion. ||19||

He, the virtuous one, freed Mount Kailasa, which had been lifted by Ravana in his pride and strength, by simply pressing his toe on it. ||20||

Burning the forest of existence with the fire of his supreme meditation, he ascended to the top of the three worlds and attained the state of his own true nature. ||201||

Srikanta and Vasudatta, due to their great enmity, killed each other in many births. ||202||

In the previous birth of Vedavati, the soul of Ravana desired to be associated with Sita. Due to this karmic influence, he abducted Sita in his birth as Ravana. ||203||

When Ravana was Shiva, he, being lustful, killed Sribhuta, a knower of the Vedas, a great Samyagdarshi, for the sake of Vedavati. ||204||

Sribhuta, after ascending to heaven, fell from there and was reborn as Vasu in the city of Pratiṣṭhāna. Due to sorrow, he performed austerities with the intention of attaining liberation and was born in the heaven of Sanatkumara. ||205||

After falling from there, he was born as Lakshmana, the younger brother of Rama, a wielder of the discus, and a great devotee of Rama. ||206||

This valiant Lakshmana, due to the unbreakable enmity from a previous birth, killed the soul of Shiva, who had become Ravana. ||207||

Since Sita's soul had suffered the pain of separation from her brother in a previous birth due to Ravana's soul, she became the cause of Ravana's destruction. ||208||

##  Chapter 314 of the Padma Purana

**20.** Ravana, who had crossed the ocean and killed Lakshmana while he was on the earth, was a fierce and violent being.

**21.** Lakshmana, having killed Ravana, who was the moon to the Rakshasas, conquered the entire earth, including the oceans.

**21.**  The Kevalis say, "Where is such a hero, and where is such a feat? This is the greatness of karma, that even the impossible is achieved."

**212.** Thus, there is a constant exchange between the slayer and the slain. The one who is slain in one existence becomes the slayer in the next, and the one who is the slayer in one existence becomes the slain in the next. This is the state of beings in the cycle of existence.

**213.** Where are the supreme pleasures in heaven, and where is the intense suffering in hell? Oh, how contrary are the actions of karma!

**214.** Just as a great quantity of the most delicious food is contaminated by poison, so too is the most excellent austerity contaminated by its cause.

**215.** To contaminate austerity for the sake of its cause is like cutting down a Kalpavriksha to plant a field of millet, or watering a poisonous tree with nectar, or grinding a garland of precious gems for a thread, or burning sandalwood from the head of a cow for charcoal.

**216.** In the world of living beings, a woman is a mine of all vices. What kind of evil deed is there that she does not commit?

**217.** Karma, once performed, inevitably returns to bear its fruit. Who can change this in the three worlds?

**218.** If those who have embraced Dharma attain this state, what can be said of those who are devoid of Dharma?

**219.** Even those who have embraced the path of a monk, but who are envious of the objects of their pursuit, do not attain liberation, even if they perform severe austerities. They are still bound by the burning passions.

**220.** One who has no peace, no austerity, and no self-control, due to false views, what means does such a wicked soul have to escape the cycle of existence?

**221.** Where elephants intoxicated with pride are carried away by the wind, there the rabbits who live on land are already taken away.

**222.** Thus, knowing the cause of these great sufferings, let people who are concerned with their own welfare not engage in the bond of enmity.

## The Hundred Verses of Pattuttar

**Chapter**

Even in India, one should not speak ill of those who give charity. See, Sita received slander merely from words. ||224||

There was a village called Mandalik, and a Muni named Sudarsana came there. People went to greet him after he arrived at the Muni's garden. ||225||

Sudarsana, his sister, was standing there, and the Muni was speaking good words to her. Vedavati saw this, and she was a true Shraman. ||226||

Then, eager to show her own right view, she spoke to the villagers, "Look, you should see this Muni, he is beautiful. I saw him sitting alone with a beautiful woman." Some people believed her, but not the wise ones. ||227||

The people disrespected the Muni, and he vowed not to eat until this slander was removed. Vedavati's face was flushed with shame, and she said to the Muni, "I, a sinner, have spoken falsely about you." She was inspired by the city deity. ||228||

Thus, she apologized to the Muni and convinced the others. In this way, Sita, in her previous birth as Vedavati, falsely slandered the brother and sister, and therefore she received this false accusation in this birth. ||229-231||

Even if a real fault is seen, it should not be spoken of to those who follow the Jina's teachings. And if someone else speaks of it, one should try to stop them with all one's might. ||232||

Those who speak of faults that cause hatred in the world, and are related to the teachings, will suffer for a long time and wander in the cycle of birth and death. ||233||

It is a great virtue of the jewel of right view to try to hide even a fault that has been committed. ||234||

One who reveals the false faults of others out of ignorance or jealousy is completely outside the Jina's path. ||235||

Hearing this wonderful teaching of the Muni, the gods, demons, and humans were filled with great wonder. ||236||

Knowing the cause of great suffering, O aspiring beings who desire your own welfare, do not cultivate enmity with anyone. ||223|| 

Page #334:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana, knowing the fierce enmity between Lakshmana and Ravana, the entire assembly trembled with great sorrow and fear, becoming devoid of envy.  The sages were terrified by the world, the gods were filled with extreme anxiety, the kings were overwhelmed with worry, and some were awakened.  Many who were proud of their eloquence shed their pride and became peaceful.  Even those who were harsh in their actions due to the strong influence of karma, attained right faith.  The assembly, momentarily stunned by the intensity of karma, gasped, "Alas! What a sight!"  Humans, Asuras, and gods, with folded hands, bowed their heads to the sage and praised Vibhishana, saying, "O Blessed One! We have heard this excellent, enlightening, and virtuous story through the grace of the sage's feet, thanks to your shelter."  Then, filled with joy, all the kings, gods, and sages, along with their retinues, praised the omniscient God.  "O Lord, adorned with all virtues! You have adorned these three worlds, therefore your name 'Sakalabhusana' is truly meaningful."  Your wealth of knowledge and insight, devoid of comparison, shines brightly, rejecting all other forms of wealth.  This world, orphaned, unstable, and miserable, bound by birth, old age, and death, has been suffering since time immemorial.  But today, through your grace, it has attained the supreme self-realization, the Jain path.  O Kevalin! O one who has accomplished his purpose! For us, who are afflicted by various diseases, old age, separation, and death, who are like a herd of deer frightened by a hunter, and whose souls are trapped by harsh and inauspicious great karmas that are difficult to escape, may this karma quickly be destroyed.

**One Hundred and Six**

**Verse 248**

In the dense darkness of the world, where beings are lost in the objects of sense, you are a lamp, O Lord! You are a lake for those who are tormented by the intense thirst for liberation. You are a fire to burn the forest of karmic aggregates, and you are the sun for those who are agitated by the fall of the great snow of various sorrows.

**End of the One Hundred and Sixth Chapter**

**Verse 106**

Thus ends the One Hundred and Sixth Chapter of the **Sri Padma Purana**, known as **Sri Arsha**, composed by **Ravi Sena Acharya**, which describes the previous births of **Ramadeva** along with his entourage.

The commander, Krtaantavaktra, having heard the seven hundred and one chapters and thus knowing the great suffering of the cycle of birth and death, said to Deemaabhikhazya, "I am overwhelmed with sorrow."  ||1||

"Wandering in the path of falsehood, in this endless world, I am now filled with sorrow. I wish to embrace the life of a Shraman." ||2||

Pabhanaabha then said, "How can you bear this extremely difficult path, abandoning this supreme love?" ||3||

"How will you endure the intense cold, heat, and other hardships? How will you bear the words of wicked people, which are like sharp thorns?" ||4||

"You, who have never known the touch of sorrow, who are as delicate as the heart of a lotus, how will you spend the night on the ground in a forest filled with wild animals?" ||5||

"You, whose bones and veins are clearly visible, who have fasted for a long time, how will you accept alms in a vessel held in your hand in another's house?" ||6||

"You, who have never endured the army of enemies, filled with elephants and chariots, how will you bear the humiliation of defeat from low-born people?" ||7||

Krtaantavaktra then replied, "For one who is capable of abandoning this love, which is like a sweet nectar, what else is unbearable?" ||8||

"Until the body, like a pillar, is felled by the thunderbolt of death, I wish to escape from this world, which is a trap of suffering and blindness." ||9||

"Just as compassionate people do not keep those who have escaped from a house engulfed in flames, so too, compassionate people do not keep those who have escaped from the world, which is burning with suffering." ||10||

"Even if it is not now, separation from you, like a great man, will surely come in the future. Then, who, understanding the evil of the world, will not seek the welfare of their soul?" ||11||

"It is true that the suffering caused by your separation will be unbearable. But may such suffering never be experienced again. This is the thought that has arisen in my mind." ||12||

The distressed Raghava, bound by the rules of the seven hundred and one chapters, spoke with difficulty. "You are blessed, having abandoned wealth like me, and are now inclined towards the virtuous path." (3) "If you do not attain Nirvana in this life, and are a god, then I, in distress, am worthy of being enlightened by you." (14) "If you consider even a single favor done by me, then do not forget it, make this vow, O noble one." (15) Saying, "As you command, so shall it be," and bowing as per the rules, the commander-in-chief, filled with intense detachment, approached the Kevala, the Lord of all ornaments. (16) Bowing down, he renounced all external and internal attachments, his face was serene, he was valiant, he had left behind worldly entanglements, and his actions were graceful. (16-17) Thus, many great kings, attaining supreme detachment, filled with great fervor, embraced the vow of non-attachment, having received initiation. (18) Some became Shravakas, and some attained right faith. Thus, the assembly, adorned with the three jewels, was filled with joy. (19) When the Lord of all ornaments departed from that mountain, the gods and demons, bowing with devotion, went their respective ways. (20) With eyes like lotus petals, Rama, bowing to the Kevala, the Lord of all ornaments, and to the saints who were devoted to attaining liberation, in due order, approached Sita, who was radiant with pure brilliance, and who was resplendent like a flame born from the ghee offering. (21-22) She stood peacefully amidst the group of Aryikas, her own rays of light were shining, she had beautiful, calm eyebrows, and she seemed like another pole star surrounded by a group of stars. (23) She was firm in her adherence to right conduct, she had renounced garlands, perfumes, and ornaments, yet she was adorned with a family of fortitude, fame, love, fortune, and modesty. She was wearing soft, white, smooth, and long garments, and she seemed like a holy river whose foam was being stirred by a gentle breeze, or like the clear autumn season with its abundance of blooming reeds. (24-26)

In the Padma Purana,
She appeared as if she were the very embodiment of the blessings bestowed upon those who have renounced the world, or as if she were the very goddess of the Jina's teachings, who embodies the form. ||27||
Seeing Sita like this, his mind shattered by confusion, Balarama stood still, like a Kalpa tree. ||28||
His eyes and brows, naturally steady, fixed upon her, he contemplated her, like a mountain standing near the clouds of autumn. ||26||
This is the best army, residing within the cage of my arms, or the moon's crescent, naturally, for my eyes, which are like lotuses. ||30||
Even when she was with me, she was terrified by the sound of the clouds, how will this ascetic woman, in the forest, not be afraid? ||31||
With the weight of her hips, she walked with a graceful, languid gait, this delicate Sita will surely be destroyed by austerity. ||32||
Where is this body, and where is the austere penance of the Jina? What effort is there in burning a lotus, for one who burns a tree with fire? ||33||
She who has eaten the most delightful food, as she wished, how will she accept whatever alms she receives? ||34||
She who, with the auspicious sounds of the vina, flute, and mridanga, slept in a heavenly abode, like a celestial palace, how will this timid Sita spend the terrifying night in the forest, filled with the sounds of birds and deer? ||35-36||
See, my mind is filled with delusion, what have I done? I have abandoned my beloved, driven by the slander of ordinary people. ||37||
Where is another woman who is favorable, dear, virtuous, the most beautiful in the entire world, who speaks sweet words, and is the land of happiness? ||38||
Thus, his mind overwhelmed by the burden of worry, he was extremely distressed, and trembled, like a wavering moon. ||39||
Then, remembering the words of the Kevali, his tears stopped flowing, and with great difficulty, his eagerness subsided, and he was free from fever. ||40||
She appeared as if she were the very embodiment of the blessings bestowed upon those who have renounced the world, or as if she were the very goddess of the Jina's teachings, who embodies the form. ||24-27||
Seeing Sita like this, his mind shattered by confusion, Rama stood still, like a Kalpa tree. ||28||
His eyes and brows, naturally steady, fixed upon her, he contemplated her, like a mountain standing near the clouds of autumn. ||26||

"Even when she was with me, she was terrified by the sound of the clouds, how will this ascetic woman, in the forest, not be afraid?" ||31||

Then, remembering the words of the Kevali, his tears stopped flowing, and with great difficulty, his eagerness subsided, and he was free from fever. ||40||
1. Most delightful food.
2. Residing in a heavenly abode, like a celestial palace.

### Chapter 331

Then, bearing the natural vision, Rama, with great joy, approached Sita, the virtuous one, and bowed to her with devotion and affection. ||4||

Narayana, with a gentle soul, also joined his hands in salutation and greeted Sita, following the footsteps of Padmanabha. ||42||

"You are blessed, O Bhagavati! You are worthy of worship, the bearer of excellent conduct. You are like the earth, holding the Meru, the mountain of virtue. Therefore, you are worthy of our worship." ||43||

"You have first obtained the supreme nectar of the Jina's words, by which you will cross the ocean of samsara." ||44||

"May this be the path for all other virtuous women, with beautiful minds, praised in both worlds." ||45||

"You have brought your soul, your family, and the world under your control by practicing this kind of kriyayoga, with a pure heart." ||46||

"Whatever we have done, good or bad, should be forgiven, for those who are attached to the state of samsara stumble at every step." ||47||

"O Peaceful One! O Mindful One! By being devoted to the Jina's teachings, you have filled my heart with immense joy, even though I was filled with sorrow." ||48||

Thus praising Sita, Rama and Lakshmana, with joyful hearts, proceeded towards the city, with Lavana and Ankusha leading the way. ||49||

The Vidhyadhara kings, filled with immense joy, were moving ahead, their bodies trembling with wonder. ||50||

In the midst of thousands of kings, the two handsome heroes, surrounded by gods like Indra, entered the city. ||51||

Before them, queens, riding on various vehicles, restless and accompanied by their retinues, were following the proper protocol. ||52||

Seeing Rama entering, the women, perched on the towers of the palace, were engaged in conversation, filled with various emotions. ||53||

"This is Sri Baladeva, the proud one, devoted to purity. He has abandoned his beloved, even though he is a scholar." ||54||

"This is a beautiful act done by this one, born in a pure lineage, for the sake of the men, who are like the pillars of the world." ||55||

Who could have stopped Sri Rama from becoming free from suffering in any way? ||40|| 

Page #340:
---------------------------
199
In the Padma Purana, Sita, who is pure and virtuous, has been unjustly accused. Who would not know that she brings happiness to the mind? ||56||
Some were saying, "Oh friend! Look at Rama, bereft of Sita. He appears like the moon without moonlight and the sun without radiance." ||57||
Others said, "What can the beauty of another do for him? He is himself supremely beautiful, the wise Balarama." ||58||
Some said, "Oh Sita! What have you done by abandoning such a great husband? You are truly hard-hearted like a thunderbolt." ||59||
Some said, "Sita is supremely blessed, wise, devoted to her husband, and a true woman. She has left the misery of her home, seeking her own good." ||60||
Some said, "Oh Sita! How could you leave these two delicate, joy-giving, and supremely devoted sons?" ||61||
The love of women for their husbands may sometimes waver, but never for their sons nurtured by their own milk. ||62||
Some said, "These two princes are the best of men, nourished by virtue. What is the mother doing here? Everyone is engaged in their own karma, receiving the fruits of their actions." ||63||
Thus, the women, engaged in conversation and eager to see Rama, were not satisfied, like bees that never find enough honey. ||64||
Many noble men, seeing Lakshmana, said, "This is Narayana, adorned with the wonderful Lakshmi, who has conquered the world with his power, who holds the discus in his hand, who is radiant, the lord of Lakshmi, the best of all, and who is, as it were, the embodiment of the vow of widowhood for the enemies of the gods." ||65-66||
Thus, Rama and Lakshmana, praised and worshipped by the crowds of the city, entered their home like Indra himself entering his celestial chariot. ||67|| 
This is the way it is. What they have done is right. ||55||

## Chapter One Hundred and Eight

The king, Shrenik, having heard the story of the destruction of the wicked, was filled with doubt and sorrow. He thought, "Even though Sita has broken the bond of affection that had grown so strong, how will she, with her delicate body, be able to endure the great austerities?"  

He saw that the two sons, Lavana and Angusha, who had eyes like those of a deer, were endowed with all prosperity and radiance, yet they had been deprived of their mother. Now, with only their father left, how would these two sons, who had been raised in constant comfort, bear the pain of their mother's loss? 

When even the most powerful and noble men face such adversity, what hope is there for others?  Thinking this, King Shrenik said to the Ganadhara, Gautam, "I have faith in the truth of what the Omniscient has seen about the world."  Then, Indrabhuti, the Ganadhara, began to tell Shrenik the story of Lavana and Angusha. 

He said, "O King! In the city of Kakand, there lived a king named Rativardhana. His wife was named Sudarshana, and they had two sons named Priyankara.  

The king had a minister named Sarvagupta, who, though he bore the burden of the kingdom's wealth, secretly harbored a rivalry with the king and was eager to find ways to kill him. 

The minister's wife, Vijayavali, was devoted to the king. She secretly informed the king of her husband's schemes. The king, though outwardly unconvinced, believed her in his heart.  Vijayavali then revealed a sign to the king, saying, "Tomorrow, in the assembly, the minister will provoke a quarrel with you. He will speak rudely to you."  The king, who was free from the desire for other women, accepted this information intellectually, but not outwardly.  

Outwardly, the king said, "O Vijayavali! He is my devoted servant. How could he speak disrespectfully to me?  I have never been treated so poorly by Vijayavali." 

Page #343:
---------------------------
## English Translation:

**13.** Knowing the sign of conflict, the king, by means of forgiveness, prevented the arrival of misfortune.

**14.** The wicked minister, thinking, "This king is angry with me," instigated all the feudatories.

**15.** That night, the great minister, with a large amount of fuel, set fire to the king's residence, but the king was always vigilant.

**16.** The wise king, taking his wife and two sons, escaped through a secret passage in the wall, slowly and stealthily.

**17.** He then went to the king of Kashi, Kasipa, a just and powerful ruler, who was his feudatory.

**18.** When the all-knowing minister was established in the kingdom, he sent a messenger to Kasipa, saying, "Kasipa, pay your respects to me." Kasipa replied,

**19.** "He who commits treason against his lord is a wicked wretch destined for suffering and misery. Such a wicked person is not even worthy of being named, let alone served."

**20.** "He who burned his lord, Rativardhana, along with his wife and sons, is a traitor to his lord, wife, and children. Even remembering him is not worthy."

**21.** "I will surely cut off the head of this sinner in front of everyone, and take revenge for Rativardhana."

**22.** Thus, the wise man, like a wise person who discards false beliefs, dismissed the messenger and his words, and focused on the task at hand.

**23.** The eyes of Kasipa, devoted to his lord, and powerful, were always fixed on the minister, who was ready to attack.

**24.** The all-knowing minister, accompanied by many kings, and a large army, like a chakravarti, was urged by the messenger and arrived.

**25.** Although the all-knowing minister, vast like the ocean, had entered the wide expanse of Kashi, Kasipa did not desire peace but was determined to fight.

**26.** The messenger sent by King Rativardhana to Kasipa, carrying the rod of punishment, arrived and entered during the night.

**12.** How can a person who is supremely devoted speak against his lord like that? What you have said is impossible. 

Page #344:
---------------------------
A young man, holding a staff, arrived before King Kasipa and said, "O King! You are blessed because King Rativardhana is here."

Filled with joy, Kasipa, his face beaming, asked, "Where is he? Where is he?" 26-27. "He is in the garden." Upon hearing this, Kasipa, overflowing with happiness, went out with his inner court, carrying offerings and water for washing the feet. 28. "Rativardhana, the king who cannot be conquered, is victorious." Thinking this, Kasipa celebrated his arrival with great gifts, honors, and festivities. 29. Later, in battle, Sarvagupta was captured alive, and King Rativardhana gained the kingdom. 30. The vassals who had previously pledged allegiance to Sarvagupta, upon learning that their lord Rativardhana was alive, abandoned Sarvagupta in the midst of the battle and went to him. 31. A grand birth-festival was held for King Rativardhana, with great gifts, honors, and worship of the deities. 32. Sarvagupta, the minister, was banished to the outskirts of the city, living like a Chandala, his spirit broken, like a dead man. No one dared to look at him, and he became despised by all. 33. King Kasipa, the ruler of Kashi, adorned with a great radiance, enjoyed himself in Varanasi with the most exquisite Lakshmi, like another Lokapala. 34.

Later, King Rativardhana, weary of worldly pleasures, took Jain initiation from the Muni named Subhanu. 35. Sarvagupta, convinced that his wife Vijayavali was responsible for this betrayal, harbored intense hatred for her. 36. Vijayavali, lamenting that she could not be the king's wife nor her husband's, performed severe austerities and became a Rakshasi. 37. Driven by intense animosity, she inflicted great suffering upon Rativardhana, the Muni. However, he, absorbed in deep meditation, attained the kingdom of pure knowledge. 38.

Rativardhana's sons, Priyankara and Hitakara, embraced the pure path of Munihood and were born in the Praiveyaka. In their previous birth, in the fourth existence, they were two Brahmanas named Vasudeva and Vasudeva, born in the city of Shamali to a Brahman named Damadeva. 40.

They enjoyed the great fruits born from the tree of virtuous deeds and donations. After enjoying these pleasures, they attained the abode of the Great Gods. [43]

**The Birth of Priyankara and Hitaankara**

After leaving the abode of the Great Gods, they were born as Priyankara and Hitaankara, sons of King Rativardhana. They were endowed with the Lakshmi of knowledge and their karma of evil deeds had diminished. [44]

**The Liberation of Rativardhana**

The sage Rativardhana, through the fire of pure meditation, burned away the forest of karma and attained liberation. [45]

**The Transformation of Priyankara and Hitaankara**

The heroes Priyankara and Hitaankara, who were described briefly, were born as Lavana and Angusha, having transcended the cycle of birth and death. [46]

**The Sorrow of Queen Sudarshana**

King Rativardhana's queen, Sudarshana, was deeply devoted to her sons. Due to the nature of women, she was overwhelmed with grief at the separation from her husband and sons. [47]

**The Cycle of Rebirth**

Bound by the chains of karma, she wandered through the cycle of suffering. She endured the hardships of womanhood and experienced various births. [48]

**The Birth of Siddhartha**

Through the influence of her past good deeds, she was born as a human named Siddhartha. She was virtuous, a devotee of Dharma, and skilled in the knowledge of scriptures. [49]

**The Education of Lavana and Angusha**

Siddhartha, with her love for her sons, Lavana and Angusha, educated them in various disciplines. They became so accomplished that even the gods were unable to defeat them. [50]

**The Importance of Dharma**

Thus, know that parents are always easily available to beings in the world. Wise people should strive to perform actions that liberate them from the suffering of the body. [51]

**The Path to Liberation**

Abandon all karma, the cause of worldly growth and the source of great suffering. O noble ones, practice the austerities prescribed by Jainism, reject the sun, and strive for liberation. [52]

**The End of the Chapter**

Thus ends the One Hundred and Eighth Chapter of the Padma Purana, narrated by the Acharya Ravishena, which describes the previous births of Lavana and Angusha. [108]

The Navottara Shata Parva describes Sita's renunciation of her husband and son, and her subsequent initiation into Jainism. Here's a translation preserving Jain terms:

1. The Navottara Shata Parva tells of Sita, whose endeavors were renowned throughout the world, renouncing her husband and son, and becoming a Jain ascetic. Listen to what she did.
2. At that time, the glorious, all-adorned Kevali was present, possessing divine knowledge, understanding both the world and the beyond.
3. He had made all of Ayodhya adept in the practice of household life, prosperous, and adorned with the right Dharma.
4. All the people were steadfast in the words of the Bhagavan, as if a king, adorned with an empire, was protecting them.
5. At that time, the people were celebrating the right Dharma, were of great fortune, possessed right knowledge, and devoted to the worship of the Sadhus.
6. The Tirtha, the destroyer of worldly existence, of Muni Suvrata Nath, was shining brightly, just as the interval between the Arnath and Mallinath Jinas was shining.
7. Sita, who surpassed even the beauty of the celestial nymphs, became withered by her austerities, like a burnt Madhavi creeper.
8. She was always filled with great fervor, free from impure thoughts, and considered womanhood as something to be condemned.
9. Her chest and hair were always covered with dust from the earth, and she wore a garment of dirt, born from sweat, due to lack of bathing.
10. She performed the Parana, as prescribed by the scriptures, after four days, a fortnight, and a season, was devoted to the practice of good conduct and the fundamental virtues, free from attachment and aversion, focused on spiritual contemplation, completely peaceful, and had brought her mind under control.
11. She performed extremely difficult austerities, unbearable to others, abstaining from all flesh, with her bones and intestines visible, and renounced all earthly possessions, taking refuge in a wooden image.

The Navottara Shata Parva

A being whose cheeks had sunk in, covered only by skin, with a high, dry brow, resembling a dried-up river. She walked the earth for a period of time equal to a Yuga, with a gentle gaze, taking alms according to the rules, protecting her body through tapas. She had become so otherworldly through tapas that even her own people could not recognize her in the streets. 

Seeing her, people would always tell her story. Those who saw her once and then again could not recognize her as the same being. 

In this way, she performed excellent tapas for sixty-two years, and then, after performing the perfect Sallekhana for thirty-three days, she abandoned her body, like a discarded garment, and ascended to the Aran-Achyuta realm, attaining the position of Pratyindra. 

Gautama Swami says, "Behold the greatness of Dharma in the Jina's teachings! This being, having abandoned the female form, became a male, the lord of the gods!"

In that Kalpa, where the sky was illuminated by the brilliance of jewels, and where the presence of gold and other precious substances created a wondrous and extraordinary spectacle, she attained the position of Pratyindra in the Achyuta heaven, residing in a celestial chariot resembling the peak of Mount Meru, filled with her family, and possessing supreme wealth. 

There, she was the object of the gaze of hundreds of thousands of goddesses, and, surrounded by a retinue of stars, she shone like the moon. 

In this way, King Shrenik heard from the mouth of Gautama Ganadhar many other excellent stories and ancient tales that destroy sin. 

Then, King Shrenik asked, "At that time, in the Aran-Achyuta Kalpa, who was the lord of the gods, the Indra, who was so glorious that even the Indra of the gods, Sita, was his rival in terms of tapas?"

In response, Ganadhar Bhagwan said, "At that time, Madhuka was the Indra of the Aran-Achyuta heaven. His brother was Katabha, and he enjoyed the great wealth of Indra for twenty-two oceans. 

After the passage of sixty-four thousand years, in due course, due to the influence of his remaining good deeds, Madhu...

In the Padma Purana, it is said that Pradyumna and Samba, the sons of Krishna, were born in Dwarika in the Bharat Kshetra.  The difference between the Ramayana and the Mahabharata is 64,000 years.  Arista-nemi, the Tirthankara, fell from heaven and was reborn as Madhu in the Bharat Kshetra, as the son of Vasudeva and Rukmini.  The king of Magadha said to Gautam Swami, "O Lord, just as a wealthy person is never satisfied with wealth, I am not satisfied with your words, which are like nectar."  "O Lord, please tell me the story of Achyutendra Madhu. I wish to hear it. Please be gracious to me."  "O Ganendra, who is devoted to meditation, please tell me the full story of Madhu's brother, Kaidabha, as you know it well."  "What good deeds did he perform in his previous life? How did he obtain the three jewels, which are extremely rare and the best in the three worlds?"  "O Lord, your words are revealed step by step, and my mind is also grasping the subject step by step. My heart is also becoming very eager. In this way, everything seems appropriate."  Gautam Ganadhar said, "In the Magadha country, which is full of all kinds of grains, where the four varnas are very happy, which is full of dharma, artha, and kama, which is adorned with beautiful chaityalayas, which is filled with cities, villages, and mines, which is very beautiful with rivers and gardens, and which is full of assemblies of sages, there was a great king named Nityodit at that time. In the same country, there was a village called Shaligram, which was equal to a city."  "In that village, there was a Brahmin named Somadev. His wife was Agnila, and they had two sons named Agnibhuti and Vayubhuti."  "Both of these sons were proficient in the six rituals, including Sandhya-vandana, they were experts in the Vedas and scriptures, and they were full of pride in their scholarship, thinking, 'Who is better than us?'"  "Due to the great fire of pride, they were filled with excessive madness. They thought, 'Enjoyment is always worthy of being enjoyed,' and they turned away from dharma."

The Navosarashatam Parva

A Muni named Nandivardhana, accompanied by many virtuous ones, was wandering this earth.  He arrived at Shaliagrama. ||46||  This Muni, through his Avadhi-jnana, saw the entire world.  He stayed outside the village in a garden suitable for the virtuous. ||42||  Hearing of the arrival of these great Shramanas, the people of Shaliagrama, with great pomp, went out to meet them. ||43||  Seeing the people of the town going out in a large group, Agnibhuti and Vayubhuti asked someone, "Where are these people going, all together in a group?" ||44||  He told them, "A Digambara Muni, without any clothes, has arrived.  They are all going to pay their respects to him." ||45||  Then, filled with anger, Agnibhuti, along with his brother, went out and said, "I will defeat all the Shramanas in a debate." ||46||  Approaching the Shramanas, he saw their leader, Nandivardhana Muni, seated in the midst of them, like the moon rising among the stars. ||47||  Then, Satyaki, the chief of the Shramanas, said to them, "O Vipras, come and ask your questions to the Guru." ||48||  Agnibhuti, laughing, said, "What do we want from you?"  The Muni, with composure, replied, "There is no fault in your coming here." ||49||  One of the Brahmanas said, "These two have come to defeat these Shramanas in a debate.  Why are they sitting so far away?" ||50||  "Very well," said the two Brahmanas, filled with anger, and sat in front of the Muni.  With great arrogance, they repeatedly asked, "What do you know? What do you know?" ||51||  The Muni, with Avadhi-jnana, said, "Where are you two coming from?"  The Vipras replied, "Don't you know that we are coming from Shaliagrama?" ||52||  The Muni said, "I know you are coming from Shaliagrama.  My question is, in this endless forest of the world, from what state are you coming?" ||53||  They said, "Does anyone else know this, or only I?"  Then the Muni said, "Listen, O Vipras, I will tell you." ||54||

In the Padma Purana,
At the edge of the village, in the forest, two jackals lived together. They were both deformed in appearance and loved each other dearly. || 55 ||
In the same village, there lived an old farmer named Pramaraka. One day he went to his field. When the time for sunset arrived, he was overcome with hunger and went home, leaving his tools behind, thinking he would return soon. || 56-57 ||
He had not yet reached home when suddenly, dark clouds like the mountains of Ajjanagiri descended upon the earth, pouring rain day and night. These clouds calmed down after seven days, meaning it rained continuously for seven days. The two jackals mentioned earlier, driven by hunger, emerged from the forest in the dense darkness of the night. || 58-59 ||
Then, the jackals ate all the tools left behind by the farmer, which were soaked in the rain and covered in mud and stones. After eating, they experienced severe pain in their stomachs. Finally, afflicted by the rain and wind, the two jackals died as a result of their karma and were reborn as the sons of Somadev, a Brahmin. || 60-61 ||
After that, the farmer Pramaraka went to his field in search of his tools. There, he saw the two dead jackals. The farmer took the dead jackals home and made their skins into bags. || 62 ||
Soon, the farmer Pramaraka also died and was reborn as the son of his own son. He regained his memory of his past life, which made him mute. || 63 ||
"How can I speak to my son from my previous life, knowing him as my father? And how can I speak to my daughter-in-law from my previous life, knowing her as my mother?" Thinking this, he embraced silence. || 64 ||
"If you don't fully believe this, then the Brahmin has come here to see me and is sitting among his family." || 65 ||
The Muni Raja called him and said, "You are the same farmer Pramaraka, and now you have been reborn as the son of your own son." || 66 ||
This is the nature of the world. Just as an actor on stage becomes a king and then a servant, and a servant becomes a king, in the same way, a father becomes a son, and a son becomes a father. A mother becomes a wife, and a wife becomes a mother. || 67-68 ||

In this world, which is like a potter's wheel, souls go up and down due to their karma. Knowing this, you should condemn this worldly state. Now, give up your silence and speak words that are beneficial.

Upon hearing this, the man was overjoyed. He got up, his fever gone, his body tingling with joy, his eyes and face beaming. He circled the Muni, as if possessed by a spirit, and then fell at his feet, like a tree that has been cut down.

He said, "Oh, you are all-knowing! You see the state of all beings, even while sitting here. I was drowning in the terrible ocean of samsara, but you, my Lord, have shown me the three jewels of knowledge out of compassion for all beings. You have divine wisdom, so you know my thoughts."

Saying this, he renounced his family and took initiation. This story of the former merchant is well-known. Many people in the world became monks and lay followers. They went to his house and saw the bags made from the skins of the jackals, which caused a lot of commotion and wonder.

Then, Gautam Swami said, "Oh King! People laughed at these Brahmins, saying, 'These are the same jackals who eat meat, now they have become Brahmins.' These two Brahmins, who are deluded by the philosophy of 'Brahman is everything,' and who are addicted to killing animals, have cheated all the people who desire happiness. These pure monks, who are rich in tapasya, are superior to Brahmins. True Brahmins are those who follow the vow of non-violence. Those who wear long hair, which is like a great vow, who have the yajnopavita of forgiveness, who perform fire sacrifices through meditation, who are peaceful, and who are dedicated to achieving liberation, are called Brahmins. On the other hand, those who are involved in all kinds of beginnings, who are always unchaste, are called Brahmins in name, but not in deed. 

Page #352:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
Just as there are many people named after lions, gods, or fire,
So too are there many who call themselves Brahmanas, but are actually fallen from their vows. || 83 ||
These are the true Brahmanas, who are diligent, wealthy,
Rishis, controlled, wise, patient, gentle, and with conquered senses. || 84 ||
They are auspicious, free from doubt, blessed, and full of austerities,
Munis, ascetics, heroes, dwelling in transcendental qualities. || 85 ||
Those who wander in search of liberation, abandoning attachment to the world,
They are known as Parivrajakas, truly free from attachments and pure. || 86 ||
They diminish themselves through austerity, with diminished passions and full of forgiveness.
They destroy sin, and are therefore called Kshapanas. || 87 ||
They are Yamins, free from passions, with liberated bodies, without attachments,
Yogis, meditators, bound by knowledge, wise, and without desire. || 88 ||
They are called Sadhus, because they achieve Nirvana,
And they are called Acharyas because they always practice and teach good conduct. || 81 ||
They are endowed with the qualities of a renunciate, and they eat only pure alms,
Therefore they are called Bhikshus, and they are called Shramanas because they perform pure actions, or destroy karma, and they are engaged in the highest form of Shrama. || 60 ||
Hearing this praise of the Sadhus and the condemnation of themselves,
Those arrogant sons of Brahmanas became ashamed, humiliated, and without glory, and they went to a secluded place. || 61 ||
Then, those two sons, who were deeply saddened by the mention of their previous births as jackals, etc.,
Went in search of the place where the Lord Nandivardhana Muni was residing, after the sun had set. || 62 ||
That Muni was dwelling in a secluded part of the forest, free from attachments, having abandoned his community,
In a cremation ground full of deep pits, full of Narakankalas, filled with various pyres,
Filled with the sounds of carnivorous wild animals, swarming with ghosts and snakes,
So dark that it could be pierced by a needle, and whose sight was intensely repulsive.
In such a cremation ground, on a stone slab devoid of living beings,
He was seated in a posture of meditation, observed by those two evil ones. || 65 ||

The Navottara Shata Parva

The two wicked men, with swords drawn and enraged, shouted together, "People, come and protect his life! Where are you going now, Shraman?"  || 36 || "We Brahmanas are the best on earth, we are the direct manifestation of the gods. You are shameless, full of great sins, and yet you call us 'jackals'!" || 67 ||

Then, the two wicked men, with fierce anger and bloodshot eyes, cruel and devoid of compassion, were observed by the Yaksha. || 18 ||  Sumana thought, "Look, these wicked men are about to kill this innocent, detached, and meditative Muni." || 33 ||

Then, as they stood ready to strike, the Yaksha immobilized them, leaving them standing still and motionless. || 100 ||  Wishing to harm the great Muni, the two cruel men stood by his side like guards. || 101 ||

Then, at the time of the pure dawn, the Muni, having completed his yoga, emerged from his secluded place and sat in the open. || 102 ||  At that moment, the fourfold Sangha and the people of Shaligram arrived, and seeing this scene, they exclaimed in astonishment, "Oh, who are these wicked men?  Shame on these wicked men who are intent on causing harm!  These troublemakers are the same as the fiery and windy ones!" || 103-104 ||

The fiery and windy ones also thought, "Oh, what a great power this Muni has! He has immobilized us, who are full of pride in our strength." || 105 ||  "When we are freed from this state, if we live, we will surely see the great Muni." || 106 ||

Meanwhile, Somadev, filled with anxiety, arrived with his wife Agnila and tried to please the Muni. || 107 ||  The couple, eager to massage his feet, bowed repeatedly and showered him with many kind words. || 108 ||

The Muni saw those two wicked men. || 63-65 ||

Padmapurana
O Dev, let these wicked sons of mine live, release your anger. We are your obedient servants, along with all our relatives. ||10||
What anger can there be for the righteous? What you are saying, we are compassionate towards all, and for us, friends, enemies, brothers, relatives, etc., are all the same. ||110||
Then, the Yaksha, whose eyes were extremely red, spoke in a very deep voice, saying, "This act of the Guru Maharaj should not be spoken of in the midst of the people." ||111||
For those who see the righteous and feel disgust towards them, they quickly meet with misfortune. Wicked people do not see their own wickedness and blame the righteous. ||112||
Just as a person looking at himself in a mirror, whatever face he makes, he surely sees the same. ||113||
Similarly, a person who is eager to go in front of the righteous, to stand up, etc., gets the same fruit as the feeling he has. ||114||
He who laughs at the Muni, gets weeping in return. He who speaks harsh words to them, gets conflict in return. He who kills the Muni, gets death in return. He who harbors hatred towards them, gets sin in return. ||115||
Thus, by doing such blameworthy acts towards the righteous, the doer of such acts gets the same fruit. ||116||
O Vipra, your sons are driven by their own accumulated sins and their own actions, and they have been struck down by me, not by the righteous Maharaj. ||117||
These sons of yours, who are burning with pride in the Vedas, are very harsh, they practice blameworthy actions, and they are violent towards the restrained righteous, let them die, what harm is there in that? ||118||
The Brahmin, with folded hands and head bowed, began to appease both the fierce, angry, and fearsome Yaksha and the Muni Maharaj. ||119||
The one who had raised his arm, who was shouting loudly, who was blaming himself and his sons, and who was beating his chest, the Vipra was in great distress. ||120||

The Muni said, "O Kamalalochan, O beautiful Yaksha, forgive the fault of these two whose minds are clouded by delusion." (121)

"You have shown great affection for the Jina's teachings, O virtuous one. But, O Bhadra, it is not right to kill living beings for my sake." (122)

Saying, "As you command," the Yaksha released the two Vipra sons. Then, both Vipra sons, comforted, approached the Guru's feet with devotion. (123)

They bowed their heads, circumambulated, and offered salutations. Seeing them incapable of taking on the difficult practices of a Sadhu, the Muni said, "You two, adorned with Samyagdarshan, should take on the Anuvrata." (124)

Following his instructions, they became wise Shravakas, devoted to the happiness of household life. (125)

Their parents, devoid of proper faith, wandered in the ocean of existence without Dharma after death. (126)

But Agnibhuti and Vayubhuti, free from doubt, were imbued with the spirit of the Jina's teachings. They renounced worldly actions like violence as if they were poison. Therefore, after death, they became excellent Devas in the Saudharma heaven, where they enjoyed divine, great happiness that delighted all senses and the mind. (127-128)

Then, they were born in Ayodhya as sons of Dharini, the wife of the wealthy merchant of the sea. (129)

Their names were Purnabhadra and Kanchanabhadra. These two brothers lived happily. Later, they again embraced the Shravaka Dharma and, through its influence, became Devas in the Saudharma heaven. (130)

This time, they were born in Ayodhya, as sons of King Hemnabha and his queen Amaravati, who had fallen from heaven. They were known in the world as Madhu and Kaithabha. These two brothers were invincible, beautiful, and as terrifying as Yama. (131-132)

Gautama Swami says, "O King, just as wise people control their intellect, these two conquered this earth filled with Samantas and brought it under their control." (133)

But a powerful king named Bhima did not obey their orders. He took refuge in the city, like a chameleon hiding in a forest. (134)

Padma Purana
A letter was sent by Veer Sena to the king. All the houses on earth were destroyed by the fire of Bhima. ||135||
Then Madhu, filled with anger, quickly went towards Bhima with all his army and warriors. ||136||
He reached Nyagrodha Nagar on his way. King Veer Sena, filled with joy, entered the city. ||137||
The moon, the king of the world, saw Chandrakanta, the beautiful wife of Veer Sena. ||138||
He thought, "It would be good to live with her in the Vindhya forest. Without Chandraabha, my kingdom is not complete." ||139||
Thinking this, the king defeated Bhima in battle and subdued all his enemies. But his mind was still on Chandraabha. ||140||
He returned to Ayodhya and called all the kings with their wives. He gave them many gifts and sent them away with honor. ||141||
Veer Sena was also called. He went with his wife and stayed outside Ayodhya in the garden on the banks of the Sarayu river. ||142||
He was then invited with honor and entered Madhu's palace with his queen. After some time, he was sent away with great gifts, but Chandraabha was sent to the inner palace. The innocent Veer Sena did not know that his beautiful beloved had been kept there. ||143-144||
Then, by the coronation of the great queen, Chandraabha received the coronation and became the head of all the goddesses. ||145||
Madhu, whose mind was blinded by pleasures, felt like Indra, immersed in the ocean of happiness with Chandraabha, who was like Lakshmi. ||146||

This King Vira Sena, knowing that his beloved had been abducted, became mad and did not find any pleasure anywhere. || 147 ||

He became a disciple of a sage named Mandava, who was fond of water. He embraced the five-fold fire penance, astonishing the foolish people. || 148 ||

One day, King Madhu went to the Dharma-asana and discussed matters of state with his ministers. || 149 ||

The valiant king, endowed with the virtues of a king, entered the inner palace when the sun was about to set, as truth is always auspicious. || 150 ||

Chandrabha, distressed, said to him, "My lord, why have you been away for so long? We have been suffering from hunger all this time." || 151 ||

He replied, "This case concerning another man's wife is a tricky one, and it cannot be left unfinished. That is why I have been away for so long." || 152 ||

Chandrabha laughed and said, "What is wrong with loving another man's wife? If someone finds another man's wife dear, then he should be worshipped according to his desire." || 153 ||

Hearing these words, King Madhu, enraged, said, "Those wicked men who are lustful for another man's wife are certainly deserving of punishment, there is no doubt about it." || 154 ||

"Those who touch another man's wife or speak to her, such wicked, low-born men are worthy of punishment with five kinds of punishments and should be banished from the country. And those who are not deterred from their evil ways and are deeply infatuated with another man's wife, that is, those who indulge in another man's wife, are surely destined for hell. How can such people be worthy of worship?" || 155-156 ||

Then, the lotus-eyed queen Chandrabha, interrupting, said, "Oh, you are a great devotee of Dharma and are dedicated to the welfare of the earth." || 157 ||

"If this is considered a great sin for men who desire another man's wife, then, O King, why don't you punish yourself for this?" || 158 ||

"You are the first among those who go after another man's wife. Why are others blamed? For it is well known that as the king is, so are the people." || 159 ||

"Where the king himself is cruel and lustful for another man's wife, what is the point of legal proceedings? Let the kingdom be free from such things." || 160 ||

Here, when King Vira Sena learned that his beloved had been abducted, he went mad and did not find any pleasure anywhere. || 147 ||

Finally, to give joy to the foolish people, King Vira Sena became a disciple of a sage named Mandava, and, astonishing the foolish people, he began to perform the five-fold fire penance. || 148 ||

One day, King Madhu was sitting on the Dharma-asana, discussing matters of state with his ministers. It is right, for truth, endowed with the virtues of kings, is auspicious. Because he was busy with state affairs that day, the valiant king reached the inner palace when the sun was about to set. || 149-150 ||

From which seeds sprout and which is the life of the world. If fire is born from water, then what else can be said? ||161|| Hearing such words, Madhu was speechless. He repeatedly said to the goddess, "It is so." ||162|| Even so, bound by the fetters of wealth, he could not escape the ocean of sorrow. For one who is attached to pleasures is not freed from karma. ||163|| After a long time, filled with perfect knowledge and happiness, the virtuous Singhpada, a great soul, arrived in Ayodhya. ||164|| He stayed in the beautiful Sahasraamra forest. Hearing this, Madhu went to him with his wife and followers. ||165|| After bowing to the guru in the prescribed manner, he sat on the ground and, having heard the Dharma preached by the Jina, he became detached from pleasures. ||166|| Knowing the pain of hell, he immediately renounced the great kingdom and the princess who was unmatched in beauty on earth. ||167|| Knowing that wealth is fleeting, his brother Katabha also became a monk. Thereafter, Madhu wandered the earth, burdened by the great austerities of monastic life. ||168|| The king Madhu, who was a delight to the eyes of all, his own people and others, protected the earth and his kingdom. ||169|| Madhu, a great soul, performed the most severe and excellent austerities for hundreds of years. At the end, he died in the prescribed manner and, free from battle, attained the position of Indra in the Aranachuta heaven. ||170|| Gautama Swami says, "Oh! The influence of the Jina's teachings is amazing, for even those whose past lives were so reprehensible have attained the position of Indra. Or what is surprising in attaining the position of Indra? For those who strive, they go to the city of liberation." ||171||
What is the purpose of seeing? First, you should attain health. ||160|| From which
the origin of the body takes place and which is the life of the world, if fire is born from water, then what else can be said? ||161|| Hearing such words, King Madhu was speechless and repeatedly said to Chandrabhasa, "It is so." ||162|| Even so, bound by the fetters of wealth, he could not escape the ocean of sorrow. For one who is attached to pleasures is not freed from karma. ||163||
After a long time, filled with perfect knowledge and happiness, a muni named Singhpada, a great soul, arrived in Ayodhya. ||164|| And he stayed in the very beautiful Sahasraamra forest. Hearing this, King Madhu went to him with his wife and followers. ||165|| After bowing to the guru in the prescribed manner, he sat on the ground and, having heard the Dharma preached by the Jina, he became detached from pleasures. ||166|| The princess, who was of high lineage and unmatched in beauty on earth, and the vast kingdom, he renounced immediately, knowing the pain of hell. ||167|| On the other hand, Madhu's brother Katabha also became a monk, knowing that wealth is fleeting. Thereafter, Madhu wandered the earth, burdened by the great austerities of monastic life. ||168|| The king Madhu, who was a delight to the eyes of all, his own people and others, protected the vast earth and kingdom. ||169|| The great-souled Madhu muni performed the most severe and excellent austerities for hundreds of years. At the end, he died in the prescribed manner and, free from battle, attained the position of Indra in the Aranachuta heaven. ||170|| Gautama Swami says, "Oh!

The birth of Madhu Indra has been narrated by me to you. Sita, the rival, was born as the queen of the underworld. ||172||
From here onwards, I narrate the story of the eight valiant Kumaras, which captivates the minds of the wise. O Sun of Kings, Shrenik Maharaj, listen to this tale, which is the cause of the destruction of sin. ||173||
Thus ends the 109th Parva of the Padma Purana, known as the "Madhupaakhyana", narrated by the Acharya Ravishena, in the tradition of the Rishis. ||106||

## Dashadhikashatam Parva

**Verse 1:**

In the city of Kanchanasthan, there were two daughters of Kanchanarath, who were proud of their beauty. Their mother's name was Shatada.

**Verse 2:**

For the purpose of their Swayamvara, their father, with great enthusiasm, sent out messengers to all the kings of the earth and the Vidyadharas.

**Verse 3:**

A letter was also sent to the king of Ayodhya, informing him of the Swayamvara and requesting him to send his daughter.

**Verse 4:**

Rama and Lakshmana, filled with curiosity, sent their sons, who were endowed with great wealth.

**Verse 5:**

Then, those princes, filled with mutual love, set out for Kanchanasthan, carrying their weapons, Lavana and Ankusha.

**Verse 6:**

They rode on hundreds of Vimanas, surrounded by groups of Vidyadharas, and appeared like divine princes, adorned with Lakshmi, as they traveled through the sky.

**Verse 7:**

Their armies grew larger and larger as they saw the distant earth, and they reached the excellent city of Kanchanarath.

**Verse 8:**

In the assembly hall, adorned with various ornaments, like a divine assembly, stood two rows of Vidyadharas and kings of the earth, arranged according to their rank.

**Verse 9:**

The kings, adorned with all their splendor, were present in the assembly, displaying various skills, like the gods in Nandana.

**Verse 10:**

On the next day, auspicious for the ceremony, the two daughters, Hri and Lakshmi, emerged from their dwelling, possessing excellent qualities.

**Verse 11:**

Kanchuki, the king of Kanchanasthan, described to the daughters the country, lineage, wealth, skills, and names of all the kings who had come for the Swayamvara.

**Verse 12:**

"These Vidyadharas are seated here, with banners of monkeys, lions, tigers, bulls, and snakes. O excellent daughters, look at them one by one."

**Verse 13:**

Seeing the daughters, the kings felt shy and their radiance dimmed. They were seen to be caught in a web of doubt.

## The Hundred and Tenth Chapter

Those who are seen by the maidens, adorn themselves with their ornaments, and become fickle, forgetting their actions and their place. (14)

The princes, overwhelmed by the pride of their beauty, are filled with anxiety, wondering which of them will be chosen by these maidens. (15)

They think, "Have these maidens, who are the banners of Kamadeva, the cause of the world's madness, conquered the worlds of gods and demons?" (16)

Seeing the Lavanaankusha, they were pierced by the arrows of Kamadeva and stood still. (17)

The elder daughter, Mandakini, with her captivating gaze full of love, accepted Ananga Lavana. (18)

The other excellent maiden, Chandra Mukhi, with her beautiful face and auspicious fortune, accepted the Madanaankusha, which was her due. (19)

Then, in that army, arose a mighty roar of Halahal, accompanied by the victorious roar of the lion, causing great commotion. (20)

It seemed as if the sky and the directions were being torn apart by the minds of the people, filled with intense shame, flying all around. (21)

"Oh! We have seen this auspicious and excellent union, where these maidens have accepted the sons of Rama," said the wise men. (22)

Mandakini, the Ganges, deep and renowned throughout the world, has gone to the Lavana, the salt sea. Thus, this maiden named Mandakini, going to this Lavana, Ananga Lavana, has not done anything inappropriate or incomplete. (23)

Chandra Bhagya, who is ready to conquer the beauty of the entire world, has done a very appropriate thing by accepting the Madanaankusha. (24)

Thus, the words of the noble people spread everywhere in that assembly. For the hearts of the noble are filled with joy by good connections. (25)

The eight valiant sons of Lakshmana, Vishalya and others, with their beautiful minds, were renowned like the eight Vasus. (26)

They, filled with love for their two hundred and fifty brothers, shone like planets amidst the stars. (27)

Those other sons of Lakshmana, who were strong and full of vigor, were ready to attack Lavana and Ankusha out of anger, because they were the sons of Vaidehi. ||28|| Then, those eight valiant brothers, who were eager to show off their prowess, were calmed by those beautiful maidens, just as a group of snakes is calmed by mantras. ||26|| Those eight brothers, along with the other brothers, said, "Brothers, be at peace. What is to be done with these two auspicious maidens now? Women are naturally deceitful, and those whose minds are attached to other men are even more so. So, who is the noble-hearted one who would desire to be afflicted by their affections? Even though these maidens have conquered the goddesses, what use are they to us? Therefore, if you wish your own well-being, turn your minds away from them." ||30-32|| Thus, by the words of those eight Kumaras, the group of brothers was subdued, just as a group of horses is subdued by reins. ||33|| At the place where those excellent maidens had chosen the sons of Sita, a tumultuous sound of music arose. ||34|| The flutes, conch shells, drums, cymbals, and kettledrums, which filled the entire horizon, made a beautiful sound that captivated the minds and ears. ||35|| Just as the lesser gods are filled with sorrow when they see the glory of Indra, so too were the sons of Lakshmana filled with distress when they saw the glory of the Swayamvara. ||36|| They thought, "We are the sons of Narayana, adorned with brilliance and radiance, endowed with youthful vigor, possessing excellent helpers, and powerful. ||37|| What quality are we lacking that these maidens did not choose any of us, but instead chose the sons of Janaki, abandoning us all?" ||38|| Or, what is the wonder in this? This is the way of the world. Due to the strange workings of karma, this world of moving and unmoving beings is strange indeed. ||39|| Whatever is destined to be obtained by whom, where, how, and why, is surely obtained by him there, in that way, and for that reason. ||40||

Thus, when the sons of Lakshmana began to grieve, the son of Rupavati, whose wonder had ceased, laughed and said, "O good men! Why are you grieving for a mere woman? Your actions are causing great laughter." [41-42]
"What do we have to do with these girls? We have obtained the light of the Jinesvara, the messenger of liberation, that is, the form of the Jina-mudra has become the root of our minds. Why then, like fools, are you grieving over this again and again?" [43]
"Those who are like banana stalks, empty and with their souls destroyed, are under the control of desires. They are not worthy of grief or laughter." [44]
"All beings are under the control of karma. Why do you not do that which destroys karma?" [45]
"Lost in the dense forest of existence, living beings are experiencing such sorrows. Therefore, destroy that forest of existence." [46]
"O brothers! This is the land of karma, but due to the grace of our father, we, with our minds clouded by delusion, consider it heaven." [47]
"In my childhood, while sitting in my father's lap, I heard a very beautiful thing read from a book, that the human birth is rare in all existences. One who does not do his own good after obtaining it is cheated." [48-49]
"This being obtains wealth through giving, heaven through austerity, liberation through knowledge, and a painful destiny through sin." [50]
"Knowing that rebirth is certain, if we do not perform austerity, then we will have to obtain again a painful destiny full of sorrows." [51]
Thus, those valiant princes, terrified by the whirlpool of suffering in the ocean of existence, attained enlightenment. [52]
And soon, going to their father, bowing down, and standing respectfully, with folded hands, they spoke in a very sweet voice, "Father, listen to our request. You are not capable of creating obstacles. We wish to take initiation. Please make it possible." [53-54]
"Seeing this world as fleeting like lightning and devoid of essence, we are filled with great fear." [55]
"We have now attained the highest enlightenment, by which we will cross the ocean of existence." [56]

The Five Great Puranas

We wish to abandon from afar those enjoyments which are as fearful as the hoods of the venomous serpent, whose essence is doubt and whose nature is like fire, and which are the cause of supreme suffering. ||5|| Neither mother, nor father, nor brother, nor relatives, nor friends are of any help in protecting this body, which is subject to karma. ||58|| Father, we know the unparalleled affection you and our mothers have for us, but this is a great bondage for worldly beings. ||5|| How long can the happiness arising from your affection last? Even after enjoying it, separation is inevitable, and such separation is as terrible as a crocodile. ||59-60|| When this being, satiated with enjoyments, abandons this body like a wicked friend, what is gained then? ||61||

Then Lakshmana, overwhelmed with love, smelled his sons on their heads and looked at them again and again, saying, "These palaces, which are like the peaks of Kailasa, are made of gold and jewels, adorned with thousands of golden pillars, have diverse and beautiful grounds, are adorned with beautiful balconies, are fit for enjoyment, are pure, are beautiful, are equipped with all kinds of amenities, are filled with fragrant breezes like those of the Malaya mountain, attracting bees, have various pure lands suitable for bathing and other rituals, are white like the autumn moon, have women like celestial nymphs, are endowed with all virtues, are like the palaces of heaven, are delightful with the music of the vina, flute, mridanga, etc., and are extremely pure due to the stories of the Jina's life, are standing before you, dear children! How will you, after living happily in these palaces, take initiation and live in the forests and mountains? ||62-68|| My dear sons, it is not proper for you to leave me, who am bound by affection, and my mother, who is consumed by grief. Therefore, enjoy your wealth. ||69||

1. फणान् भीमान् म -  hoods of the venomous serpent
2. शङ्कासुखानल -  doubt and whose nature is like fire
3. तथास्मासु म -  affection you and our mothers have for us
4. सर्वे म० -  are of any help in protecting this body
5. उज्झित्वा म० -  abandon from afar
6. त्यक्त्वा, संचय ज०, ख० -  abandon this body like a wicked friend
7. तावदीशतां ज०, ख० -  enjoy your wealth

Those whose minds were attached to affection, who were afraid of the world, who were completely averse to the pleasures obtained by the senses, who were adorned with the support given by noble heroism, and whose minds were engaged in contemplating the truth, all those Kumaras, after a moment's reflection, said: "In this world, mothers, fathers, and others have come and gone countless times. This house is like a prison for those who are bound by affection. 
70-72.
Fools serve this cage-like house, which is the ultimate beginning of sin and which increases various sorrows, not the wise. 
73.
We will act with firm determination so that bodily and mental suffering will not befall us again. Are we our own enemies? 
74.
Even though a householder thinks, "I am innocent, I have no sins," he still becomes stained like a white cloth that is kept. 
75.
Because those who dwell in the household experience suffering again and again, and because they find pleasure in sin, great souls have abandoned the householder's dharma. 
76.
You have said, "Enjoy wealth well," but you are throwing us into a dark well, even though you are wise. 
77.
Just as a hunter kills a deer that is drinking water from thirst, so death kills a man who is not satisfied with pleasures. 
78.
This world, attached to the attainment of objects, is dependent, ignorant, and without medicine. It plays with snakes in the form of desires. 
79.
These men, like fish, who are immersed in the reservoir of the house and attached to the flesh of objects, are caught by death through the power of the flute of disease. 
80.
Therefore, the Lord of the human world, the Lord Jinendra, who is worshipped by the three worlds, has said that the world is subject to its own karma. 
81.
Therefore, O father! These pleasures, which have no good outcome, which are the temptation of loved ones, which are hated by the wise, and which are as fickle as lightning, are completely attached to them, that is, 
1. स्नेहबन्धनमेतद्धि चारकं नारकं गृहम् म०, ख० ।

Padmapurana
When separation from loved ones is inevitable, what is the joy in this strange world? ||3|| The attachment, "This is mine," is born of delusion, for the soul alone experiences the pain of coming and going. ||8|| In the island of false scriptures, filled with the mire of delusion, overflowing with the foam of sorrow and anguish, swarming with the whirlpools of birth, rippling with the waves of disease and death, enveloped in the deep abyss of delusion, churning with the fierce group of crocodiles of anger and other passions, terrifying with the roar of false logic, shaken by the wind of falsehood, filled with the salty water of bad destinies, and burning with the unbearable and intense fire of separation, we have been distressed for a long time, O father, in this terrible ocean of the world. ||85-88|| After wandering through countless births, we have attained human existence with great difficulty. Therefore, we want to do that which will prevent us from sinking again into this ocean of the world. ||8|| Then, surrounded by their families, they asked their parents in turn, and the eight valiant princes left the prison of their home. ||10|| As they left home, those valiant ones, who knew the nature of the world, had a sense of indifference towards that vast kingdom, just as there is indifference towards withered grass. ||6|| Then, they went to the garden called Mahendrodaya and, with great fervor, took the vows of renunciation from the great sage Mahabale. ||12||
Those who are free from all beginnings, naked, full of forgiveness, self-controlled, free from all attachments, detached, and absorbed in meditation, such perfect yogis dwell eternally in accordance with the law. ||13||
By destroying sin through proper austerities and restraining merit through spiritual yoga, those who have exhausted all the worldly illusions have attained the state of Jainism, the infinite bliss. ||14||

## Dashadhikashatam Parva

This Kumaraashtakamangal, whoever reads it with humility and listens with devotion, all his sins are destroyed, and the sun shines brightly, and the moon rises. ||15||

Thus ends the Dashoत्तरशतं Parva, named Kumaraashtakamangala, composed by Acharya Ravishena. ||110||

Those eight Munis, having destroyed the entire universe, attained the state of Nirvana, filled with infinite bliss. ||64||

Gautam Swami says, "The man who, with humility and devotion, reads or listens to the auspicious story of these eight Kumaras, all his sins are destroyed, and he shines like the sun, and the best moon rises." ||6||

Thus ends the one hundred and tenth Parva of the Padma Purana, known as Aarsha, composed by Acharya Ravishena, describing the initiation of the eight Kumaras. ||110||

## The One Hundred and Eleventh Chapter

Even though it is so long-winded, it has not been established in self-welfare. ||13|| Those who destroy lust and sorrow do not have peace even for a moment, because death, who keeps his feet near their heads, always waits for an opportunity. ||14|| For this perishable body, which is destroyed in a moment, what does this lowly creature, who is a slave to worldly desires, not do? ||15|| The one who knows that life is impermanent, renounces all possessions and does not engage in self-interest, is destroyed in a state of unfulfilled desires. ||16|| What is the use of a thousand scriptures if the soul does not find peace? Even one step is enough to attain peace and contentment. ||17|| Just as a crow with broken wings desires to fly in the sky but does not put in the effort, similarly, this being desires to do good deeds but does not put in the effort as required. ||18|| If a person without effort were to obtain what he desires, then there would be no one in the world who is deprived or poor. ||19|| The one who gives food and other things to a guest, a virtuous person, and a guru, and who acts according to the guru's words, never suffers. ||20|| 

**Aryan Hymn**

The life of a person whose heart is troubled by hundreds of different businesses, and who experiences sorrow every day, is lost like a jewel held in the palm of the hand. ||21||

Thus ends the One Hundred and Eleventh Chapter of the Padma Purana, composed by the Acharya Sri Ravishena, known as the Arsha, which describes the journey to the other world from the Bhamandala. ||111||

The ascetics, enveloped in the garment of the Dharma-meditation, stand on the open platforms of the forest at night, their minds absorbed in Dharma-meditation. 13. At that time, in the cold season, when the trees are destroyed by the great cold wind, the lotus forests are withered, and people delight in the sunrise, they reside in the sanctuaries of the palaces as they please. 14. Their chests are the bases for the play of the breasts of young women. 15. They make sweet sounds, produced by the vina, mridanga, flute, etc., at will, a supreme nectar for the ears. 16. They are served by beautiful women, who have conquered the vina with their voices, with great respect, and are like gods served by goddesses. 17. Thus, they spend their time happily, endowed with abundant pleasures, day and night, by the influence of all their good deeds. 18. Thus, those two supreme men were dwelling happily. O King! Now listen to the story of Shri Sail Veer. 19. By the influence of his past good deeds, Hanuman, the son of the wind, enjoys supreme sovereignty in the city of Karna Kundala, like a god. 20. Endowed with the greatness of the Vidyadharas and the most excellent actions, Hanuman roams the earth at will, accompanied by thousands of women. 21. Mounted on an excellent chariot and endowed with excellent splendor, Shri Hanuman plays like a god in the excellent forests and other regions. 22. Once, in the spring season, which is the cause of the madness of the world, adorned with flowers and filled with the fragrance of the beloved, 23. Hanuman, whose mind was filled with devotion to the Jinas, was delighted and set out towards Mount Meru, accompanied by his inner palace. 24. He stopped at the peaks of the Kulachala mountains, which were adorned with various kinds of beautiful flowers and served by the gods. 25. Those forests were full of intoxicated bees and cuckoos, and were beautiful to behold because of the many lakes. 26. Those forests, with their various trees, flowers, and fruits, were enjoyable for couples, and were adorned with mountains studded with jewels. 27.

Rivers with clear water and distinct islands, ponds with excellent steps and trees on their banks. ||28||
Water bodies filled with various aquatic plants, algae, and worms, served by birds with sweet voices. ||29||
Great rivers with waves rising in foam, filled with large aquatic animals, and adorned with colorful patterns. ||30||
These rivers are adorned with beautiful forests and excellent gardens, and are captivating with their picturesque landscapes. ||31||
There are numerous Jina Kutas, made of various jewels, capable of destroying sins, and adorned with appropriate ornaments. ||32||
Seeing such things, and being served by beautiful women, Hanuman gradually attained the highest bliss. ||33||
Hanuman, with his hair standing on end, ascended to the sky and stood on the peak of the chariot, showing these things to the woman. ||34||
"Look, my dear, look at these beautiful places on Mount Meru, where the Jinas are bathed, near the peaks." ||35||
"Look at these peaks, made of various jewels, like the sun, beautiful, high, and vast." ||36||
"Look at these caves with beautiful entrances, deep, illuminated by jewels, interconnected, and extending far and wide with their rays." ||37||
"This is the beautiful Bhadrasala forest on the earth, and this is the famous Nandan forest on the Mekhala. This is the forest of Saumanasa, located on the chest of the upper region, filled with Kalpa trees and vines, and adorned with various jeweled stones." ||38||
"This is the Panduka forest, located on the peak, adorned with thousands of Jina temples, suitable for the play of the gods." ||40||
"This forest is filled with continuous festivals, like the realm of Indra, filled with the music of Yakshas, Kinnaras, and Gandharvas, crowded with celestial maidens and Apsaras, and adorned with various divine flowers." ||41||
"On the beautiful peak of Mount Meru, in its natural state, this wonderful Jain temple is seen." ||43||

Page #373:
---------------------------
The temple, resplendent like a cluster of clouds tinged with the fiery glow of twilight, is golden, towering like a peak of the sun, adorned with the finest jewels, of exquisite form, strung with thousands of pearl garlands, embellished with tiny spheres and mirrors, adorned with tinkling bells, silken banners, lamps, and yak-tails, with magnificent ramparts, arches, and lofty gateways, adorned with fluttering banners of various hues, radiant with golden pillars, profound, with beautiful balconies, impossible to describe in its entirety, fifty yojanas long and thirty-six yojanas wide. O Kante, this Jina temple appears like the crown of Mount Meru.

Thus praising the temple to the Mahadevi, Hanuman, upon reaching its vicinity, descended from the front of his celestial chariot and, filled with joy, circumambulated it.

Then, leaving all else aside, he bowed with folded hands and touched his forehead to the image of the Jina within the inner sanctum, an image endowed with great splendor, resplendent like the moon amidst the stars, planets, and constellations, seated on a lion throne, radiating its own immense brilliance, like the autumn sun on the peak of a white cloud, possessing all auspicious marks.

The sight of the Jina filled the Vidyadhara queens with immense joy and prosperity.

Their bodies trembled with delight, their long eyes seemed even longer with joy, they were filled with supreme devotion, adorned with all manner of ornaments, born into noble families, and dedicated to the highest ideals. These Vidyadharis, like celestial nymphs, performed the worship of the Jina.

They offered golden lotuses, lotuses of ruby, lotuses of moonstone, and other natural flowers, filling the sky with their fragrance, and countless fragrant incense, born of sacred substances. 

Page #374:

Hanuman worshipped the Jinas with incense whose smoke rose high, with lamps having large flames, and with offerings of various kinds of garlands. ||56-58|| Then, anointed with sandalwood, adorned with saffron marks, his body covered with clothes, free from all sins, his crown marked with the monkey symbol and shining with a cluster of rays, his face filled with the rays of his eyes, which were wide open due to joy, Hanuman meditated on the Jina, and repeatedly praised the image of the Jina, the teacher of gods and demons, with hymns that destroy sins. ||59-61|| Then, seeing him, the apsaras, who were sitting in a state of playful delight, showered him with blessings. Placing the veena on his lap, he produced the nectar of music. ||62|| Gautam Swami says that those whose eyes are fixed on the worship of the Jina, and whose souls are devoted to the observance of rules, always hold welfare in their hands. ||63|| For those who are devoted to the worship of the Jina, and who behold his auspicious sight, nothing auspicious is unattainable, for they have pure minds. ||64|| To be born in the lineage of the Shravakas, to have firm faith in the Jina, and to die in a state of Samadhi, this is the complete fruit of human birth. ||65|| Thus, playing the veena for a long time, repeatedly praising and worshipping, offering salutations, and with a new and ever-renewed devotion, Hanuman, with a clear mind, did not turn his back on the Jinas. He left the Jina temple as if unwillingly, but with a sense of peace. ||66-67|| Then, mounting a chariot with twenty thousand horses, he circumambulated Mount Meru, like a great astrologer. ||68|| Like a king of mountains, Hanuman, adorned with beautiful actions, seemed to be asking for the final permission to leave Mount Meru. ||69|| Then, showering the best flowers on all the Jina temples, he slowly moved through the sky towards the Bharat Kshetra. ||70|| Then, filled with extreme love, the evening embraced the sun, as if she had found her abode on the setting sun, with a desire to dispel sorrow. ||71||

The night was covered with stars, devoid of the moon, and did not shine at all. ||72||
Descending from there, he slowly settled his army in the beautiful mountain called Suradundubhi. ||73||
There, the wind carried the fragrance of lotuses and blue lotuses, and the soldiers were happily engaged in the stories of the Jinas. ||74||
Then, seated on the peak of the chariot, near the Chandrasala, which resembled Mount Kailasa, ||75||
He saw a luminous orb, emanating from the celestial path, falling and shining brightly, and the wind turned into darkness. ||76||
He thought, "Alas, in this world, there is no place where death does not play at will, even among the gods." ||77||
Birth is as fragile as lightning, meteor, and waves, everywhere. What to speak of other beings, even the gods have it. ||78||
Whatever is enjoyed in this world by sentient beings is not eternal, there is no happiness or sorrow in the three realms. ||79||
Oh, the greatness of delusion, it is endowed with supreme power. For so long, this being has been wandering in sorrow. ||80||
After wandering through countless births in the ascending and descending cycles, one attains human birth, but it is a pity that it is lost as if it was never attained. ||81||
Attached to perishable pleasures, devoid of good conduct, beings fall into the state of suffering. ||82||
The senses are fickle, prone to wrong paths, and cause great suffering. They do not become calm without taking refuge in the path of the Jinas. ||83||
Just as the poor deer and birds are caught in a net, so too are deluded people caught in the net of desires. ||84||
He who enjoys desires like poison, is a fool, and in the end, he burns in the fire of suffering. ||85||
Who would desire a kingdom for a day, after suffering for a year? Similarly, one should not desire the pleasures of the senses. ||86||

##  The Twelfth Night

**Verse 67**

Oh, have you not heard of the dreadful paths of hell, filled with the fearsome opposition of the fierce, and the dense forests of sharp swords, which are difficult to traverse?  Do you not desire to destroy with tapas all the dense karma-mud, born from attachment?

**Verse 68**

Alas, my past time, sunk in the long and contemptible ocean of suffering, has become utterly meaningless.  Today, having obtained the light of the auspicious path and auspicious wisdom, I liberate the soul, trapped within the cage of the world, from the bonds of existence.

**Verse 69**

Thus, with a firm resolve in my heart, and having seen the true nature of the world of living beings, I, like the sun, free from the association of clouds, am eager to tread the path of righteousness.

**End of the 112th Chapter**

Thus ends the 112th chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the *Hanuman Nirveda*, composed by the venerable Sri Ravishena Acharya. 

Page #378:

## Chapter One Hundred Thirteen

**1.** After the night had passed, the sun, like molten gold, illuminated the world, just as the words of the virtuous illuminate.

**2.** The sun, like the Jina, caused the constellations to disappear and the lotuses to bloom, just as the Jina causes the assembly of the virtuous to flourish.

**3.** Just as Bharata had asked his friends before entering the forest of penance, so too did Hanuman, filled with great emotion and devoid of desire, ask his friends.

**4-5.** Then, the ministers, whose eyes were filled with sorrow and whose hearts were filled with anxiety, pleaded with their lord, "O Lord, you are not worthy of making us orphans. O Lord, full of virtue, be gracious to your devotees and protect them."

**6.** Hanuman replied, "Even though you are my devoted followers, you are my companions in misfortune, not my benefactors."

**7.** "Those who, while crossing the ocean of existence, cause others to fall back into it, how can they be called benefactors? They are truly enemies."

**8.** "When I suffered great pain in the hells, neither my mother, father, friends, nor brothers came to my aid. No one helped me."

**9.** "Having obtained the rare human birth and the knowledge of the Jina's teachings, it is not right for even a wise person to be negligent for even a moment."

**10.** "Just as I enjoyed pleasures with you, my dear friends, so too is this intense separation, caused by karma, inevitable."

**11.** "What king of gods, demons, or humans, bound by their own karma, has not been consumed by the fire of time and perished?"

**12.** "I have enjoyed pleasures in heaven for thousands of years, yet I was never satisfied, like a fire that is never quenched by dry fuel."

**13.** "The giver of coming and going, even stronger than me, has another name, karma, which has made my body incapable." 

Page #379:

14. I wish to cross the insurmountable birth-cycle and attain the state beyond the womb, where beings are deluded by the difficult journey of the cycle of existence.
15. When Hanuman, the embodiment of the forest, displayed his firm resolve, a great sound of weeping arose from the women of his inner palace.
16-18.  Then, skilled in administration and with a mind fixed on auspicious deeds, he comforted the women, who were overwhelmed with sorrow, with words that were capable of enlightening them and narrated various stories. He then placed all his sons in their respective positions in the royal duties. Surrounded by a vast circle of friends, the king, Hanuman, the son of the wind, departed from his palace-like chariot.
19-20.  He rode in a palanquin that shone with jewels and gold, adorned with small spheres, mirrors, lamps, and various kinds of fly whisks, and was decorated with divine lotuses.  He was headed towards the temple garden, the abode of supreme bliss.
21.  Seeing his palanquin, adorned with fluttering flags and garlands, people experienced both joy and sorrow, their eyes filled with tears.
22-23.  In that magnificent temple garden, adorned with various trees, filled with the sounds of cuckoos, bees, and sparrows, and fragrant with the pollen of countless flowers, the renowned sage Dharmaratna resided.
24-25.  Just as the valiant Bahubali, with a heart filled with detachment, had previously approached the great mass of jewels, the supreme yogi, the Lord Rishabha Jinendra, so too did Hanuman, with a heart filled with detachment, descend from his palanquin and approach the celestial sage Dharmaratna, who was surrounded by the Charanarshis.
26.  Approaching him, he bowed down, performed great homage, and then, placing the lotus-like hands on his head, said, "O great sage! I wish to receive initiation from you and, free from attachment to my body, live a life free from duality.
13. This karma is more powerful than I am. My body has become incapable and powerless.

In the Padma Purana,
The sage said to the noble-hearted Hanuman, "Very well, let it be so. Having seen the essence of the world, do what is best for yourself." ||28||
"Your noble mind, which has arisen to attain the eternal state with a perishable body, is truly commendable." ||26||
Having received this permission from the sage, Hanuman, filled with the fervor of renunciation, bowed down, satisfied, and sat on the lotus posture. ||30||
He immediately discarded his crown, earrings, necklace, and other ornaments, his clothes, and his mental possessions. ||31||
He broke the chains of his beloved, burned the net of attachment, severed the bonds of affection, and abandoned happiness, which was like poison. ||32||
Seeing his body as extremely perishable and harmful, he extinguished the darkness of delusion with the flame of detachment, and plucked out the hair on his head with his delicate fingers, which had conquered the lotus. ||33||
Thus, free from all attachments, a devotee of the goddess of liberation, a follower of the great vows, and adorned with the goddess of renunciation, the noble Hanuman shone brightly. ||35||
At that time, seven hundred and fifty Vidhyadhara kings, inspired by renunciation and devotion to the Lord, noble-minded, pure-hearted, and filled with great fervor, renounced their kingdoms for their sons and embraced the path of renunciation. ||36-37||
Thus, those who were extremely happy and free from all blemishes, such as Vidhyudgati and others, attained the glory of Hanuman, shining like him. ||38||
Then, those who were consumed by the fire of separation, who were filled with great sorrow, who were deeply compassionate, who were filled with renunciation, who were noble, who were afraid of the world, who were wise, who were free from great ornaments, and who were adorned with the ornament of virtue, those queenly women went to the famous Aryika named Bandhumati, bowed down with devotion, performed the highest worship, and took initiation. ||39-41||
At that time, their wealth seemed like withered grass to them. The great people, for the most part, were deeply devoted to renunciation, like those who are in love. ||42||
I desire this, therefore, please be pleased with me. ||26-27||

## The One Hundred and Thirteenth Chapter

**363**

Sri Sail, the lion among mountains, was exalted by the vows, the secrets, and the assemblies. He was a great ascetic, wise, and adorned with virtues and character. ||43||

He was praised by the great kings, delighted, and saluted by the Apsaras. He followed the pure code of conduct, as spoken by the omniscient. ||44||

Having burnt the accumulation of delusion, he attained the perfect knowledge of the Jinas. Sri Sail, the best among the ascetics, the sun among men, attained the Siddha state, the peak of liberation. ||45||

Thus ends the One Hundred and Thirteenth Chapter of the Padma Purana, narrated by Sri Ravishena Acharya, known as the Arsha, describing the liberation of Hanuman. ||113||

This is correct, because the best of men are completely detached from those who are attached to passions. ||42||

In this way, Sri Hanuman, who was like a high mountain of vows, secrets, and assemblies, was a possessor of the wealth of great asceticism, wise, and adorned with virtues and character. ||43||

Sri Sail, the great sage, who was praised by the great kings filled with joy, saluted by the Apsaras, who had burnt the accumulation of delusion, who was the best among the ascetics, and the sun among men, attained the Siddha state, the peak of liberation, by following the pure code of conduct, as spoken by the omniscient, and by attaining the perfect knowledge of the Jinas. ||44-45||

Chapter Fourteen Hundred and Fourteen

Seeing the initiation of the eight young heroes and Hanuman, Rama laughed and said, "What kind of enjoyment did these people experience?" || 1 ||

Those who abandon existing pleasures and take initiation, being farsighted, are surely possessed by planets or controlled by the wind. || 2 ||

Surely, there are no skilled physicians for them, because they have abandoned pleasurable desires and settled down. || 3 ||

Thus, the mind of Ramachandra, who was immersed in the ocean of happiness arising from the great assembly of pleasures and was under the control of karma, became dull. || 4 ||

Those who are immersed in the worldly cycle, experiencing only a little happiness, are usually surprised when they hear of transcendental happiness. || 5 ||

Thus, for those two, Rama and Lakshmana, who were immersed in great pleasures and bound by love, time was passing by, being indifferent to dharma, the principle of righteousness. || 6 ||

Then, on another occasion, Saudharmendra, adorned with great radiance, possessing supreme wealth, and characterized by courage and composure, arrived in the assembly of the gods. || 7 ||

All the ministers, adorned with various ornaments, were serving him, so it seemed as if Mount Sumeru, surrounded by other smaller mountains, was present. || 8 ||

Seated on a throne covered with radiance, Saudharmendra was bearing the splendor of the Jina, who was seated on the peak of Mount Sumeru. || 9 ||

His body was adorned with precious gems, shining like the moon and the sun. He was pleasing with his beautiful form and was a feast for the eyes. || 10 ||

Wearing a pure garland, radiating great brilliance, he seemed like Mount Nishadha, bearing the flow of the Sitoda river. || 11 ||

Adorned with garlands, earrings, armlets, and other excellent ornaments, he was surrounded by gods on all sides, like the moon surrounded by stars. || 12 || 

Page #383:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**Verse 13:**

The comparison of the moon and stars to Indra and the gods is made for human beings, because there is a great difference between the celestial gods and the Jyotishi gods. (Meaning: In the human realm, the moon and stars appear bright, hence the comparison to Indra and the gods. In reality, the Jyotishi gods have a greater brilliance than the celestial gods, and the celestial gods have a greater brilliance than Indra.)

**Verse 14:**

Indra himself was endowed with great power and illuminated the ten directions with his brilliance. Therefore, he appeared like a very tall Ashoka tree related to the Jina.

**Verse 15:**

Gautama Swami says that even if all people together continuously describe him with thousands of tongues, the description cannot be completed even in hundreds of years.

**Verse 16:**

Then, Indra, in the presence of the Lokapalas and other pure-hearted gods seated on their respective thrones, narrated this Purana.

**Verse 17-18:**

While narrating the Purana, he said, "Oh gods! You should continuously worship those supreme Arhant Bhagavans with flowers of devotion, who have destroyed this world, which is like a great demon, very difficult to conquer, destroyer of happiness, and a great enemy, with the wheel of knowledge, and who are like fire to burn all the forests of vices."

**Verse 19-21:**

Those who are capable of rescuing the noble beings from the ocean of the world, which is filled with waves of passions and crocodiles of desires, and whose birth is celebrated by Indra and the gods with a grand abhisheka on Mount Meru with the water of the ocean of milk. And those who are devoted, focused on the goal of liberation, and accompanied by their families, worship them with one-pointed devotion.

**Verse 22:**

He who exists, having abandoned the earth, which is like a woman whose breasts are the Vindhya and Kailash mountains and whose waist is the ocean waves, and having taken the woman of liberation.

**Verse 23:**

He who, having come from the front of heaven, brought light to this world, which was covered in the darkness of great delusion, devoid of dharma, and without a master.

**Verse 24:**

Just as a lion destroys elephants, those who possess extraordinary power, destroyed the eight enemies of karma in a moment.

Jinendra Bhagavan, Arhant, Swayambhu, Shambhu, Urjit, Swayamprabho, Mahadeva, Sthanu, Kalajara, Shiva, Maha Hiranyagarbha, Devdeva, Maheshvara, Sadharma Chakravarti, Vibhu, Tirthankara, Kriti, Sansarasudan, Suri, Gyanachakshu and Bhavantaka, etc. are the names by which the wise praise him. ||25-27||
The kings of men and the kings of gods praise him with pure words that contain both hidden and revealed meanings, with great devotion. ||28||
By his grace, beings who are free from karma reside in the three worlds, existing in their own nature. ||29||
His greatness, even when remembered, destroys sin, and his supreme divine Purana is the cause of joy. ||30||
O devotees of the gods, who are eager for self-welfare, be always devoted to that Maha Kalyan, the root, the Devadhideva, Jinendra Bhagavan. ||31||
In this endless cycle of birth and death, a being, driven by his own karma, rarely attains the human state, but alas, even then he gets lost in delusion. ||32||
How can those who hate the 'Ant' (the ultimate reality) attain the Ratna Tray (the three jewels) again in this vast ocean of the world, filled with the great whirlpools of the four paths? ||33||
He who, having attained the human state with great difficulty, remains devoid of the Ratna Tray, wanders like the wheel of a chariot, due to his own sinful nature. ||34||
Alas, in this human world, how many people, even those who follow the path of the past, do not respect Jinendra Bhagavan, the destroyer of the enemy of the world! ||35||
This being, performing false austerities, becomes a god with little wealth, and when he falls from there and attains the human state, he still, alas, acts treacherously. ||36||
This being, dominated by great delusion, is attached to false dharma and does not attain the supreme, Jinendra Bhagavan, the king of even the great Indra. ||37||
This creature, whose soul is attracted to the flesh of the senses, having attained the human state, is deluded by the deluding karma, which is a great misfortune. ||38||
Even if a false ascetic, by the force of evil karma, attains heaven, he remains tormented with anxiety, knowing his own inferiority. ||39||
There, he thinks, "Alas! In this beautiful place, like the Ratna Dweep, what good have I done for myself by following this path?" ||40||

Page #385:
---------------------------
## Chapter Fourteen Hundred and Fourteen

Alas! Alas! How unfortunate I am! I, a fool, have been led astray by the group of false scriptures and the eloquent, sinful, arrogant, and fallen men.  

Having attained the human birth, this excellent Jain doctrine remains elusive for the unfortunate and constantly suffering beings. 

Even for a great god who has fallen from heaven, attaining the three jewels taught by the Jinas is rare. What then can be said of other beings?

Blessed and favored is the one who, having attained the human birth, the best of all births, works for the welfare of his soul and attains the eternal three jewels.

Vibhāvasu, the best of the gods, said to himself, "When will I attain the human birth, which is the essence of existence?"

"When will I abandon the enemy of the senses, control my mind, destroy my karma, and attain the Jina-related path of liberation through austerity?"

One of the gods said, "This is the thought of a being who is still in heaven. When we all attain the human birth, we forget all such thoughts."

"If you don't believe this, why don't you go and see Rama and Balabhadra, who have fallen from the Brahma-loka and are endowed with human power?"

The mighty Indra himself replied, "Of all bonds, the bond of affection is the strongest."

"A being bound by chains on his hands, feet, and other limbs can be liberated, but how can a being bound by the chains of affection be liberated?"

"A man bound by chains can travel thousands of yojanas, but a man bound by affection cannot even move an inch."

"Lakshmana is always devoted to Rama. He is never satisfied with seeing him and is willing to give his life to serve him."

"How can he abandon Lakshmana, the benefactor, even for a moment, when his mind is restless at the thought of his absence?" 

Page #386:
---------------------------
## Padma Purana
**Chanda:** (?)
Even the wise, due to the extraordinary nature of karma, fall into delusion. Otherwise, who, having heard all about their own future, would not act for their own benefit, being conscious? ||54||
Thus, O Gods! What more can be said about beings? It is certain that one should strive with a pure heart to destroy the enemy, the world. ||55||

**Malini Chanda:**
Thus, having attained the path of the gods, the path of truth, and being completely purified by the association of the qualities of the Jina, the beautiful path shown by Indra, became pleasing. The sun, moon, and Kalpavasis, having attained pure minds, achieved freedom from the fear of the world, desiring to attain the human state. ||56||

Thus ends the 114th chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the "Shankatha of the Gods," composed by Acharya Ravishena, which narrates the story of Indra and the gods. ||114|| 

Page #387:

The Fifteenth Hundred Chapter

Then, after leaving the seat, the gods and demons, bowing to Indra, went to their respective places, carrying the intense emotions. ||1||

Two of the gods, driven by curiosity, decided to test the love of Padmanarayana, being lovers of play and united by mutual love. They said, "Let us see the affection of these two." ||2-3||

He who cannot bear even a day's absence, what will that Hari do upon hearing the news of his elder brother's death? Seeing the grief-stricken Narayana, let us make fun for a moment. Let us go to the city of Kosala. ||4-5||

What will be the face of Vishnu, overwhelmed with grief? At whom will he be angry? Where will he go? What will he say? ||6||

Having made this plan, the two wicked gods, Ratnachula and Mrigachula by name, went to the city of Ayodhya. ||7||

They caused the sound of weeping of all the women of the inner palace by divine magic in Padmabhavana, and made the gatekeepers, friends, ministers, priests, and other men in front, go to Lakshmana with downcast faces and announce the death of Rama. They said, "O Lord! Rama is dead." Hearing this, the eyes of Lakshmana, trembling with a soft breeze, became like the petals of a blue lotus. ||8-10||

"Alas, what has happened?" He had uttered half of this word when his mind became empty and he shed tears. ||11||

As if struck by lightning, he leaned against a golden pillar and sat on the throne, motionless like a clay doll. ||12||

His eyes were not closed, yet his body remained motionless. He was then assuming the form of a living man whose mind was elsewhere. ||13||

Seeing Lakshmana, who was struck by the fire of his brother's death, lifeless, the two gods were greatly distressed. ||14||

Chapter One Hundred and Fifteen

Those seventeen thousand women of Hari were adorned with the beauty of a lotus garden, gently swayed by a soft breeze. ||26||

When the Lord remained in that state, doubt entered the anxious minds of the women, who had come with great difficulty. ||30||

They, the innocent ones, touched him, entangled in delusion, thinking in their hearts, "Perhaps we have harbored some ill-will towards him, spoken some inappropriate words, or entertained some feeling that is painful to hear." ||31||

Those women, who possessed the grace and brilliance of a group of celestial nymphs, were so consumed by grief at that time that their beauty vanished. ||32||

Having heard this news from the palace guards, Rama, surrounded by his ministers, arrived there in a state of panic. ||33||

Then, surrounded by his most trusted advisors, he entered the inner palace, his steps hurried and scattered, as he was overwhelmed with anxiety. ||34||

He then saw Lakshmana's face, which had lost its radiant glow and was now pale like the morning moon. ||35||

It was not as well-composed as before, completely corrupted by nature, and resembling a lotus that had been uprooted at that very moment. ||36||

He pondered, "What could be the reason that Lakshmana is aloof and sorrowful today, with his head bowed slightly?" ||37||

Approaching him with affection, Rama repeatedly sniffed his head and embraced him, who was shaped like a tree afflicted by frost. ||38||

Although Rama saw the signs of a deceased person all around, filled with love, he considered him to be immortal, like nectar. ||39||

His body was bent, his neck was crooked, his arms were loose, and his body, breathing, contraction of limbs, blinking of eyes, etc. were all signs of a dying man. ||40||

Lakshmana had fallen into a state of meaninglessness. ||28||

Gautama Swami says that at that time, Lakshmana's seventeen thousand wives were adorned with the beauty of a lotus garden, gently swayed by a soft breeze. ||29||

Then, when Lakshmana remained in that state, doubt entered the anxious minds of the women, who had come with great difficulty. ||30||

Entangled in delusion, those innocent women touched him, thinking in their hearts, "Perhaps we have harbored some ill-will towards him, spoken some inappropriate words, or entertained some feeling that is painful to hear." ||31||

Seeing Lakshmana thus freed from his own body, Rama, overwhelmed by anxiety and intense fear, was drenched in sweat. ||41||
His face was extremely dejected, he fainted repeatedly, and his eyes were filled with tears. Rama was looking at his limbs from all sides. ||42||
He was saying, "In this body, there is not even a scratch as big as a fingernail, then how did he attain this state? - Who caused this condition?" ||43||
Thinking this, Rama's body started trembling and his soul was filled with sorrow. Although he was a scholar himself, he quickly called for those who knew about this matter. ||44||
When all the physicians, skilled in mantras and medicines, who were masters of their art, examined him and gave their verdict, Rama, filled with despair, fainted and fell to the ground like a uprooted tree. ||45-46||
With great difficulty, he was revived from his faint by sandalwood-mixed water and the wind favorable to the Talavrinta tree. Then, in great distress, he started wailing. ||47||
As Rama was afflicted by sorrow and grief, he was also experiencing pain. Therefore, he was shedding a stream of tears that covered his face. ||48||
At that time, Rama's face, covered with tears, looked like the moon adorned with rare clouds. ||49||
Seeing Rama in such a state, his heart filled with extreme sorrow, the palace, like a vast ocean, was overwhelmed with grief. ||50||
The noble women, submerged in the ocean of sorrow, with their bodies withered, filled the earth and sky with their excessive tears and cries. ||51||
They were saying, "Oh Lord! Oh Joy of the World! Oh Most Beautiful Life! Speak to us, your beloved ones. Where are you? Why did you leave?" ||52||
"Why are you leaving us without any fault on our part? Even if there is a fault, it does not stay in a person for long." ||53||
Hearing this news, Lavana and Ankusha, overwhelmed by extreme sorrow, were filled with anxiety. ||54||
372
He had become devoid of all movements. ||40||

## Chapter One Hundred and Fifteen

**Alas, this human existence is worthless!** There is no greater disgrace. Death attacks it in the blink of an eye, without warning. ||54-55||

Even Narayana, who could not be subdued by gods and celestial beings, was brought under the control of the noose of time. ||56||

**What need do we have for this perishable body and perishable wealth?**  Thinking thus, both sons of Sita attained enlightenment. ||57||

Fearing the prospect of returning to the womb, both heroes, bowing to their father's feet, boarded a palanquin and went to the garden called Mahendrodya. ||58||

There, they took refuge in the Muni Raja named Amritasvara and became great ascetics. ||59||

When the noble-minded Lavana and Ankusha were taking initiation, their minds, like clay balls, were filled with disrespect towards the vast earth. ||60||

On one hand, the separation from his sons, and on the other, the grief of his brother's death - Rama was caught in a whirlpool of sorrow. ||61||

Gautama Swami says that Lakshmana was dearer to Rama than his kingdom, his sons, his wife, and even his own life. ||62||

People in the world have different kinds of hearts. Therefore, when their loved ones reach such an undesirable state due to the force of karma, some are consumed by sorrow, while others attain detachment. ||63||

When the time comes, and the inner cause of the ripening of one's own actions manifests, the sun of enlightenment rises for beings, who, upon finding an external cause in any object, develop detachment. ||64||

Thus ends the one hundred and fifteenth chapter of the Padma Purana, composed by the Acharya Ravishena, known as the Parsvanatha, which describes the death of Lakshmana and the penance of Lavana and Ankusha. ||115||

1.  *Pashyataam* (should be *Pashyata*)

## The Sixteenth Hundred Chapter

When the time for Dharma arrived, O King Lakshmana, the world was left in turmoil by Rama, the leader of the age. ||1||

Rama's body, soft in form and fragrant by nature, though lifeless, was not abandoned by him. ||2||

He embraced it, held it in his lap, wiped it, smelled it, kissed it, and sat with it in his arms with great longing. ||3||

He could not find solace even for a moment in its release. Just as a child considers the nectar fruit to be his greatest treasure, so too did he consider that dead body to be his greatest treasure. ||4||

He cried out, "Alas, brother! Was this right? Why did you decide to leave me alone?" ||5||

"Do you not know that I cannot bear your separation? Why do you want to leave me in this fire of sorrow?" ||6||

"Alas, father! Why did you choose to do this cruel act? Why did you leave for the other world without consulting me?" ||7||

"O son! Grant me the nectar of your reply quickly. You were always so polite, why are you angry with me without any fault?" ||8||

"O beautiful one! You never held me in high regard, why have you become different now? Tell me, what have I done?" ||9||

"In the past, when you saw Rama from afar, you would stand up respectfully and place him on the throne, while you yourself would sit on the ground." ||10||

"O Lakshmana! Your feet, adorned with beautiful nails like the moon, are placed on my head, yet you are still angry. Why don't you forgive me?" ||11||

"O God! Rise quickly, my sons have gone to the forest. Let us bring them back before they go too far." ||12||

These women, consumed by your virtues, are rolling on the ground, making mournful sounds like cuckoos, bereft of you. ||13||

The garlands, jewels, belts, and earrings have fallen down. Why don't you stop this sorrowful sight? ||14||

Then, Gautam Swami says, "O King! When Lakshmana met his end, Rama, the leader of the age, left this troubled world." ||1|| 

Page #393:
---------------------------
**Chapter Sixteen Hundred and Sixteen**

375

What shall I do, and where shall I go, now that I am bereft of you? I do not see a place where I can find solace. ||15||

I see your face, which I could never tire of looking at, even now. Was it right for you to leave me, filled with such affection? ||16||

This is an unprecedented sorrow for me, with the death of my brother. The fire of grief is burning me, what can I do, I am so unfortunate? ||17||

Neither fire burns nor poison dries up the body like the death of a brother, which is beyond comparison. ||18||

Oh Lakshmana!  Suppress your anger now. This is the time for the departure of the great sages, who have renounced their homes. ||19||

See, the sun is setting, and the lotuses in the ponds are like your eyes, closed in sleep. ||20||

Saying this, Rama, freed from other tasks, quickly made a bed and lay down, embracing Lakshmana. ||21||

They say, "O God! I am alone now. Tell me your thoughts, so that I may hear them, and know why you are in this state." ||22||

Your face, beautiful like the bright moon, is now devoid of radiance. Why is this? ||23||

Your eyes were like tender leaves trembling in a gentle breeze. Why are they now dull? ||24||

Tell me, what do you desire? I will fulfill it all. O Vishnu! Do not appear like this, speak with your mouth, engage in conversation. ||25||

Do you remember Sita, who was your companion in joy and sorrow? But that virtuous lady has gone to the other world. Are you grieving because of this? ||26||

O Lord of Lakshmi! Abandon your sorrow. See, a group of Vidyadharas, hostile and intent on attack, have arrived and are entering Ayodhya. ||27||

O Beautiful One! Never before has your face looked like this, even in anger. Why is it so now? O Son! Abandon this hostile demeanor. ||28||

1. Vaimukhyam, meaning death. 
2. Vishannaasi, meaning you are sorrowful.
3. Vidyadharasamooha, meaning a group of Vidyadharas.

I bow to your feet, which are renowned for their dance and previous deeds. You are known throughout the world for being favorable to me. ||26||

You are the unparalleled light, the great lamp of the world, but you have been extinguished by the strong wind of time. ||30||

You had attained the position of King of Kings and brought great celebration to the world. How can you leave it orphaned? ||31||

You conquered the entire army of your enemies with your wheel of dharma. Why do you now endure the defeat of the wheel of time? ||32||

Your beautiful body, which was once adorned with royal fortune, still shines even now, though it is lifeless. ||33||

O King of Kings, wake up, abandon sleep, the night has passed, this evening is announcing the rising of the sun. ||34||

Eternal good morning to the Jinas, the observers of all worlds, and to the Muni Suvrata, the refuge of all auspicious beings. ||35||

I know this dawn as the ultimate darkness, for I see your face without any movement. ||36||

O wise one, rise, do not sleep for long, abandon sleep, go to the assembly hall, sit there to receive the homage of your ministers. ||37||

See, this Kamalaakar, filled with sorrow, has reached the state of wakefulness, but why are you, being wise, still indulging in sleep? ||38||

You have never done such a contrary act before, therefore rise and be attentive to your royal duties. ||39||

Brother, because of your long sleep, the proper activities are not being performed in the Jina temples, such as beautiful music and auspicious sounds of drums. ||40||

Because of your state, the morning duties of the compassionate monks have become slack, and they are experiencing great anxiety about their lord. ||41||

This city, saddened by your absence, does not shine, devoid of the sounds of the vina, flute, and mridanga. ||42||

It seems that my past karma, which was accumulated earlier, has come to fruition. I have been afflicted by the sorrow of separation from my brother. Oh Lord, this is a great hardship! ||43||
Just as you, O Sun of Mankind, brought joy to me, who was filled with sorrow, during the previous battle, so too, rise now and bring joy to me, who am deeply distressed. ||44||
Thus ends the 116th Parva of the Padma Purana, composed by Acharya Ravishena, known as the "Sri Ramadeva Vipralapa," which narrates the lamentations of Sri Ramadeva. ||116||

Then all the Vidhyadhara kings, having known the news, arrived in Ayodhya with their wives. || 1 || Vibhishana, along with his sons, Chandrodara, the son of the king, Sugriva, and Sasivardhana, all arrived with their retinues. || 2 || Their eyes were filled with tears, and their minds were disturbed. They entered the palace of Padmanabha, with folded hands and bowed heads. || 3 || Filled with sorrow, they performed the proper rites, sat down on the ground in front of Rama, and after remaining silent for a while, they slowly spoke these words: "O Lord, although this sorrow, born from the loss of a beloved one, is difficult to bear, yet you are the knower of all things, and therefore you should be able to overcome this sorrow." || 4-5 || Having spoken thus, and while they were still silent, Vibhishana, who was wise in the nature of the ultimate truth and the worldly affairs, spoke these words: "O King, this state of existence is without beginning and end. This is not the first time that such a thing has happened in the world." || 6-7 || "In this cage of the world, whoever is born must die. Even with various means, death cannot be avoided." || 8 || "When this body is certainly perishable, then it is futile to seek solace in it. In reality, those who are wise in their own interests, engage in the means of self-benefit." || 9 || "O King, no one who has gone to the other world responds to our cries. Therefore, you should not grieve." || 10 || "From the union of man and woman, the bodies of beings are born, and they perish like bubbles of water." || 11 || "Even the Indras, along with the Lokapalas, are subject to falling from heaven when their karmic bodies are destroyed due to the depletion of their merit." || 12 || "In this body of a mortal, which is filled with the pains of the womb, afflicted with diseases, as unstable as a drop of water on a blade of grass, and a mere collection of flesh and bones, what is there to cherish?" || 13 || "Why does one grieve for the dead, thinking of oneself as immortal? Why does one not grieve for oneself, which is caught in the jaws of death?" || 14 ||

Chapter Seventeen Hundred and Seventeen

Why grieve for an individual? Why not grieve for yourself, who is destined to suffer in the midst of the cycle of birth and death? ||14||

If the death of only one were to occur, then it would be appropriate to cry out loud. But when this defeat related to death is equally obtained by all, then there is no need to cry. ||15||

At the time this being is born, death immediately surrounds it. In this way, when death is a common dharma for all, why is there grief? ||16||

Just as a deer, tormented by a hunter in the forest, grieves for its lost hair, so too does this being, longing for the union of desired objects, grieve in vain. ||17||

When we all must depart from here, separated, why is there grief at their departure in the first place? ||18||

Look at the courage of this being, who sits fearlessly before the lion, like a deer before the wielder of the thunderbolt, Yama. ||19||

Have you heard of anyone else, in the netherworld or on the earth, who has escaped the grip of death, besides the one who is the Lord of the world? ||20||

Just as the fragrant forest of the Vindhya mountains is consumed by fire, so too is this world, caught in the cycle of existence, consumed by the fire of time. Do you not see this? ||21||

Wandering through the forest of existence, and becoming subject to desire, these beings, like intoxicated elephants, fall under the control of the noose of time. ||22||

Even though this being attains heaven, having reached the path of dharma, it is still cast down like a tree on the bank of a river, due to its impermanence. ||23||

Just as fires are extinguished by the clouds of a deluge, so too have countless groups of kings and gods been destroyed by the cloud of time. ||24||

Even flying far into the sky and going far into the netherworld, I have not seen a place that is beyond the reach of death. ||25||

At the end of the sixth kalpa, all of Bharatavarsha is destroyed, and even the great mountains are shattered. What then can be said of the human body? ||26||

Those who were endowed with bodies of vajra, and whom even the gods and demons could not kill, have also attained impermanence. What then of humans, who are as ephemeral as the inner part of a banana? ||27||

The One Hundred and Seventeenth Chapter, entitled "Lakshmana's Separation and Vibhishana's Description of the State of the World," from the Padma Purana, as narrated by Acharya Sri Ravishena, is complete.

This chapter describes how Vibhishana, a wise being with the brilliance of the sun among the celestial beings, tried to convince Rama to abandon his sorrow over Lakshmana's death. Vibhishana explained that clinging to the body, which is filled with kshaya (negative emotions) and chinta (worry), is futile. He argued that the body is merely a burden and that it is better to abandon it and move on. However, Rama, like a devoted disciple, refused to abandon Lakshmana's body, just as a disciple would not disobey their guru's command.

The chapter also highlights the suffering of beings in hell and the folly of clinging to worldly pleasures. It emphasizes the importance of detaching oneself from the cycle of birth and death and seeking liberation.

The chapter concludes with a reminder that even a wise being like Vibhishana, who could transcend the limitations of the physical world, could not convince Rama to abandon his attachment to Lakshmana's body. This underscores the power of attachment and the difficulty of overcoming it.

Chapter One Hundred and Eighteen

Then, the kings, beginning with Sugriva, said to the god, "We will build a pyre, and on it we will perform the rites for the king's body." [1]

Angered, Rama replied, "Let you all burn on the pyre, along with your mothers, fathers, and grandfathers." [2]

"Or, if any of you have a friend with a wicked mind, then you should all go to death quickly with him." [3]

"Rise, rise, let us go to another place, Lakshmana. Let us not hear such harsh words from these wicked ones." [4]

Having said this, they quickly moved to lift the body of their brother. The kings, in confusion, supported him by his back and shoulders. [5]

Rama, not trusting them, took Lakshmana himself and went to another place, like a child carrying a poisonous fruit. [6]

There, with tears in his eyes, he said, "Brother, why do you sleep so long? Rise, the time has come to go to the bathing place." [7]

Having said this, he placed the dead Lakshmana on a bathing platform, with all its accessories. Then, in great grief, he poured water from a golden pitcher over him for a long time. [8]

After adorning him with all his ornaments, including his crown, he quickly ordered the servants of the food-house, "Bring various jewel-encrusted and golden vessels, and fill them with the finest food." [9-10]

"Bring the best and purest wine, and prepare various delicious dishes filled with flavors." [11]

Having received these orders, the servants, who always obeyed their master's wishes, respectfully brought all the things. [12]

Then, Rama placed a morsel of food in Lakshmana's mouth. But it did not enter, just as the words of the Jina did not enter the ears of the Abhavy. [13]

1. Dish.
2. Lakshmana's + inside + mouth, this is the division.

## Chapter One Hundred and Eighteen

Then, if you have anger towards me, O God, then what has this ambrosia-like food spoiled here? ||14|| 
This, O Lakshmi-Dhar, is your favorite, the best wine. Drink this, placed in a cup adorned with blooming lotuses. ||15|| 
Saying this, he placed it in his mouth with great respect. How could that beautiful wine enter there, in the unconscious mouth? ||16|| 
Thus, with a heart filled with affection and devoid of detachment, Rama performed all these actions as if Lakshmana were alive. ||17|| 
Although Lakshmana was lifeless, Rama played beautiful music for him, accompanied by the sounds of the vina, flute, etc. ||18|| 
Then, with great desire, he lifted Lakshmana, whose body was anointed with sandalwood, with both arms, placed him in his lap, and kissed his forehead, cheek, and hand repeatedly. ||19|| 
He said to him, "O Lakshmana, what has happened to you that you do not leave sleep? Tell me once." ||20|| 
Thus, while Rama, afflicted by the demon of affection, was engaged in this activity, the rise of the karma, born of great delusion and attachment, arrived. ||21|| 
Knowing this news, the enemies, like dark clouds roaring to cover the sun, the ultimate brilliance, were filled with anger. ||22|| 
With a heart filled with animosity and great anger, the enemies, led by Charuratna, the son of Sunda, the brother of Shambuka, went to Vanamali, the son of Indrajit. ||23|| 
Charuratna, inciting him, said, "Lakshmana, having killed our uncle and both of us, has established Viradhit on the throne of the Patal Lanka kingdom." ||24|| 
Then, having found Sugriva, the moon-like and brotherly benefactor, to gladden the army of the Vanaras, Rama, afflicted by separation, received news of his wife Sita. ||25|| 
Then, desiring to conquer Lanka, Rama, with the Vidyadharas, crossed the ocean in aerial chariots. ||26|| 

Page #402:

Padma Purana
Rama and Lakshmana obtained the Vidya (knowledge) called Singhavahani and Garuda Vahini. Due to their influence, they captured Indrajit and others. ||27||
The same Lakshmana who had killed Ravana by obtaining the Chakra Ratna, has now been killed by the wheel of time. ||28||
The monkey warriors were intoxicated by the shade of his arms, but now, with their wings clipped, they have become fit for the ultimate attack. ||29||
Today is the twelfth day of mourning for Raghava. He carries the dead body of Lakshmana, and what other kind of delusion can be upon him? ||30||
Although he is unparalleled, the destroyer of weapons like the Hal and Musala, yet he is vulnerable to attack because he is trapped in the mire of grief. ||31||
We fear only him, and no one else, because his younger brother Lakshmana has destroyed all the connections of our lineage. ||32||
Then, Indrajit's son, Vanamali, hearing of the calamity that had befallen his vast lineage, became agitated and blazed forth with the renowned path, that is, he flared up with the renowned vigor of the Kshatriya clan. ||33||
He commanded his ministers, gathered all the people for war by the sound of the drums, and set out for Ayodhya with his son, Charuratna. ||34||
Those two, Vajramali and Charuratna, who were protected by the ocean of their army and who were filled with anger towards Sugriva, were eager to provoke Rama. ||35||
Hearing that Vanamali had arrived with Charuratna, all the Vidyaadhara kings came to Ramachandra. ||36||
At that time, Ayodhya was filled with confusion, agitated on all sides, and trembled with fear, just as it had trembled when Lavanasura had arrived. ||37||
Seeing the enemy army approaching, Rama, who possessed unparalleled valor, carried the dead Lakshmana in his arms and looked towards the great bow called Vavarta, which was steady in its nature and crooked like the brow of Yama. ||38-39||
Meanwhile, in heaven, there was a great tremor among the army of the god of death, Krtaantavaktra, and the celestial bird Jatayu. ||40||
Many islands were destroyed. ||41||

## Chapter One Hundred and Eighteen

**Verse 41:** In the same chariot where Jatayu, the supreme god, was born, the god Krtaanta also attained the same glory.

**Verse 42:** Krtaanta, the god, said to Jatayu, "O king of gods, why have you become so angry today?"

**Verse 43:** Jatayu, the knower of the future, replied, "When I was in the Grdha state, the one who nurtured me like a beloved son, is now facing a large enemy army, and he is grieving over the death of his brother."

**Verse 44:** Then Krtaanta, the god, using his vision of the future, spoke with great brilliance, his heart filled with sorrow and anger.

**Verse 45:** "Friend, it is true, he was also our beloved master. By his grace, I performed many daring deeds on earth."

**Verse 46:** "He also told me to free him from danger. Now that danger has befallen him, let us go to him quickly."

**Verse 47:** Saying this, the two gods, with their black hair and locks swaying, their crowns shining brightly, and their ear ornaments sparkling, set out from the celestial abode of Indra towards Ayodhya.

**Verse 48:** They were both great and wise, skilled in destroying the enemy's forces.

**Verse 49:** Krtaanta said to Jatayu, "You go and confuse the enemy army, make them lose their minds, and I will go to protect Rama."

**Verse 50:** Then Jatayu, the wise and generous, who could change his form at will, confused the enemy army with his illusions.

**Verse 51:** As the enemies approached, thinking, "This is Ayodhya," he showed them large mountains in front and behind, using his magic.

**Verse 52:** Then, standing near Ayodhya, he destroyed the entire army of the enemy Vidyadharas, and filled both the earth and the sky with the city of Ayodhya.

**Verse 53:** As a result, the entire land and sky became filled with the city of Ayodhya, so much so that it seemed as if the entire world was nothing but Ayodhya.

**Verse 54:** The enemy army, overwhelmed by this display of power and grandeur, was completely defeated. 

Page #404:
---------------------------
In the Padma Purana,
**55.** The enemy army, seeing the earth and sky filled with Ayodhyas, became devoid of pride and fell into distress.
**55.** The soldiers said to each other, "How can we sustain our lives, how can we stay alive, in the presence of this extraordinary deity named Rama?"
**56.** Where did this power of transformation come from in the Vidyadharas? What have we done, we who acted without thinking?
**57.** Even many fireflies, though they are opposed to the sun, what can they do to the sun whose thousands of rays illuminate the entire world?
**58.** O friend, even if we want to flee, there is no way to escape, for this terrible army is spreading throughout the entire world.
**59.** There is no great benefit in death, for a living human being may, by the ripening of his actions, attain good fortune.
**60.** If we are destroyed like bubbles by these waves of soldiers, what will we gain from it?
**61.** Thus, the entire army of Vidyadharas, engaged in mutual conversation and trembling violently, became utterly distraught.
**62.** Gautama Swami says, "O King, after that, Jatayu, playing with his power of transformation, mercifully gave those Vidyadhara enemies a path to flee towards the south."
**63.** With trembling hearts and shaking bodies, those Vidyadharas, like birds frightened by a hawk, fled with great speed.
**64.** What answer will we now give to Vibhishana? What is our glory now, with our souls utterly humbled?
**65.** What radiance will we show to our own people? Where is our fortitude, or our desire to live?
**66.** Having decided thus, Vrajmali, the son of Indrajit, became filled with shame. Seeing the power of the gods, he became detached from his own power.
**67.** As a result, he, along with Charuratna, the son of Sunda, and other beloved ones, renounced anger and became a devotee of the sage Rativega.
**68.** To frighten Jatayu, the terrible god, with his thunderbolt, struck the king who had been freed from his mortal body.

Chapter Eighteen Hundred and Eighteen

The Devata with a troubled mind, having been bound by the law of karma, thought, "Oh, these great sages have attained liberation."  ||66||  At that time, I, having blamed the pure-souled saints, have suffered great pain in the animal realm and in hell. ||67||  Even now, I am experiencing the consequences of that wicked enemy, but it is so small that I will not be deluded again into the long ocean of existence. ||68-69||  Thus, calming his mind, he introduced himself properly, bowed down with devotion, and sought forgiveness from the sages. ||70||  Having done so, he went to Ayodhya, where Rama, bewildered by the grief of his brother, was acting like a child. ||71||  There, he saw with great compassion that the Devata, Krtaantavaktra, was watering a dry tree, having changed his form to teach Rama. ||72||  Seeing this, the Devata, Jatayu, also placed a plow on the bodies of two dead oxen, took a seed in his hand, and began to sow it on the stony ground. ||73||  After some time, Krtaantavaktra began to churn a pot full of water in front of Rama, and Jatayu began to pound sand in a mortar. ||74||  Thus, these two Devata performed many other meaningless acts in front of Rama.  Then, Rama asked them in turn, "Oh, fool! Why are you watering this dead tree? Why are you placing a plow on a dead body? Why are you wasting seeds on stone? How will you get butter by churning water? And, oh, child! Will oil be produced by pounding sand? In all these actions, only labor remains, not even an atom of the desired fruit. Why have you begun this useless effort?" ||75-78||  Then, in turn, the two Devata said, "We also ask you a truthful question."

Panapurana
Then, the god of the earth, whose mind was polluted, embraced Lakshmana, who was the embodiment of auspiciousness, and said these words: "Why do you criticize the best of men, Saumitri? Do you not see the fault in uttering such inauspicious words?" 
"As long as this dispute with the one who is the harbinger of death continues, Jatayu has arrived carrying a dead human body."
Seeing him face to face, Rama asked, "Why are you carrying this dead body on your shoulders, being entangled in delusion?"
Jatayu replied, "You are wise, yet you ask me this. Why don't you ask yourself why you are carrying a body devoid of breath and blinking eyes?"
"You quickly see even the smallest fault in others, like the tip of a hair, but you don't see your own faults, which are as big as Mount Meru."
"We have great affection for you, as you are our king. It is a saying that like attracts like."
"You are the king chosen by all of us, including myself, who are all wish-fulfilling demons."
"We roam the entire earth carrying the banner of the king of the mad, and we make the entire earth, which is mad and hostile, favorable to us."
Hearing these words, Rama's delusion weakened, and remembering the words of his guru, he felt ashamed of his foolishness.
His mind, which was covered by the cloud-like darkness of delusion, was now shining brightly with the rays of understanding.
His mind, free from the mud of delusion, was as clear as the autumn sky.
His sorrow, which was dispelled by the sweet words of his guru, which were like nectar, made him shine as brightly as he had before when he was reunited with his sons.
He, the best of men, gained steadfastness through the words of his guru, just as Mount Meru gains shade from the water of the Ganges.
"Why are you carrying this lifeless body in vain?"

## Chapter One Hundred and Eighteen

**Verse 66:** Like a lotus petal freed from the touch of a drying wind, his soul, pure and free from defilement, was filled with joy.

**Verse 67:**  Lost in great darkness, he found the rising sun, like a man starved, he found the food he desired.

**Verse 68:**  Parched with thirst, he found a great lake, like a man suffering from a terrible disease, he found a great medicine.

**Verse 69:**  Like a man seeking to cross the ocean, he found a ship, like a man lost in a wrong path, he found the right way.

**Verse 100:**  Like a merchant seeking to reach his destination, he found a great caravan, like a prisoner seeking freedom, his strong chains broke.

**Verse 101:**  Remembering the path of the Jinas, Padma-nabha was filled with joy, his eyes like blooming lotuses, he radiated supreme radiance.

**Verse 102:**  He thought, "I have escaped from the depths of a dark well, or I have reached another existence," and he embraced this thought.

**Verse 103:**  "Alas, like a drop of water clinging to the tip of a blade of grass, this human life is fleeting, it is destroyed in an instant."

**Verse 104:**  "Wandering through the four realms of existence, I have attained a human body with great difficulty, why then am I a fool, why am I acting in vain?"

**Verse 105:**  "Whose are these beloved wives? Whose is this wealth and prosperity? Whose are these relatives? These things are easily found in the world, but enlightenment is extremely rare."

**Verse 106:**  Knowing that Rama was enlightened, the two gods withdrew their illusions and manifested their divine powers, causing wonder in the world.

**Verse 107:**  A unique wind, pleasant to touch and fragrant, began to blow, and the sky was filled with beautiful chariots and flying machines.

**Verse 108:**  Rama heard his own story, sung by celestial maidens, accompanied by the sweet sound of the vina.

**Verse 109:**  In the meantime, the god of death, Jataayu, asked Rama, "My lord, are these days filled with happiness?"

**Verse 115:**  Such a great man, Rama, attained the same radiance as the water of the Jina's birth ceremony.

**Verse 116:**  His soul was pure, his intentions free from defilement, Rama was filled with joy like a lotus forest free from the drying wind.

**Verse 117:**  He felt such joy as if a man lost in great darkness had found the rising sun, or a man starved had found the food he desired.

**Verse 118:**  Or like a man parched with thirst who found a great lake, or a man suffering from a terrible disease who found a great medicine.

**Verse 119:**  Or like a man seeking to cross the ocean who found a ship, or a man lost in a wrong path who found the right way.

**Verse 120:**  Or like a merchant seeking to reach his destination who found a great caravan, or a prisoner seeking freedom whose strong chains broke.

In the Padma Purana,
The king asked, "O Lord, have these days passed happily for you?" Upon the gods asking this, King Ramachandra replied, "Why do you ask about my happiness? All happiness is attained by those who have attained the state of a muni." [106-110]
I ask you, who are you both, with such gentle appearances? And for what reason have you done this deed? [111]
Then the divine being of Jatayu said, "O King! You know, when I was a vulture in the forest and attained peace from the sight of the muni." [112]
There, you nurtured me with your brother Lakshmana and the goddess Sita. Sita was abducted, and I was going to stop her abduction, so I was killed by Ravana. [113]
O Lord! At that time, overwhelmed with grief, you made me chant the Pancha Namaskara mantra, which is connected to the five supreme beings. [114]
I am that Jatayu, by your grace, I was born in heaven, abandoning that kind of suffering related to the cycle of birth and death. [115]
O Guru! Blinded by the great happiness of the gods, I, the ignorant one, did not know that such a calamity had befallen you. [116]
O God! When your calamity ended, your karma-udaya made me aware of this and I have come to do some retribution. [117]
Then the divine being of Krtaantavaktra, wearing a somewhat good attire, said, "O Lord! I was your Krtaantavaktra commander." [118]
You said, "Remember me in times of trouble." So, O Master! I have come to you, having understood your command. [119]
At that time, seeing that wealth of the gods, the people who enjoyed worldly pleasures were filled with utmost wonder and became pure of heart. [120]
Then Rama said to the commander Krtaantavaktra and the divine being of Jatayu, the lord of the gods, "Oh, virtuous men! You both are the saviors of the afflicted beings." [121]
Look, you both, endowed with great power and possessing a very pure heart, have come here from heaven to enlighten me. [122]
Thus, having conversed with them both, Rama, freed from the distress of grief, performed the funeral rites of Lakshmana on the banks of the Sarayu river. [123]

The One Hundred and Eighteenth Chapter

With a heart full of detachment and free from sorrow, Rama, the protector of Dharma-Maryada, spoke these words to Shatrughna:  ||12||
"O Shatrughna! You rule the kingdom of mortals. I, with my mind and soul free from all desires, will enter the forest to worship the path of liberation." ||125||
Shatrughna replied, "O Lord! I am not greedy for pleasures due to attachment. My mind is fixed on the kingdom of unfettered samadhi. I will attain that same kingdom of unfettered samadhi along with you. There is no other path for me." ||126||
"O Sun of Men! In this world, who has found satisfaction in captivating sensual pleasures, in friends, relatives, brothers, desired objects, and even in their own life?" ||127||
Thus ends the One Hundred and Eighteenth Chapter, named "Lakshmana-Samskara-Karanam," in the Padma Purana, composed by Sri Ravishena Acharya, known as the "Kalyana Mitra Deva." ||118||

The twenty-first chapter. Having heard his words, which were extremely beneficial and certain, Rama pondered for a moment, considering all his duties.  ||1|| Seeing Ananglavana's son sitting there, he bestowed upon him the position of king with supreme power. ||2|| Ananglavana, who was equal to his father in qualities and actions, and who was bowed to by all the chieftains, became the bearer of the family's burden. ||3|| Ananglavana, who was supremely established, full of love and prowess, attained all the auspiciousness of the earth, just as victory does. ||4|| Vibhishana gave the kingdom of Lanka to his son, Subhushan, and Sugriva also gave his kingdom to Angada's son. ||5|| Then, Dasharatha's son Rama, seeing the kingdom like poisoned food or a wicked wife, abandoned it, just as Bharata had done before. ||6|| He chose the one path of liberation, which was worshipped by gods and demons, cherished by the sage-aspirants, and characterized by the emergence of the quality of impartiality. ||7||  Frightened by birth and death, and bearing the stain of karma, Rama embraced the path prescribed by the sage Suvrata. ||8|| Having attained enlightenment, Kakutstha, free from the afflictions of existence, shone brightly, like the sun emerging from the clouds. ||9|| Then, a wealthy merchant named Arhadasa came to see him.  Sitting in the assembly, Rama inquired about the well-being of the entire community of monks. ||10|| The merchant replied, "O King, because of your suffering, even the monks on earth have experienced great sorrow." ||11|| At that moment, the sky-faring sage Suvrata, the bearer of the lineage of the sage Suvrata, who was the embodiment of detachment, came to know of Rama's situation and arrived there. ||12||

The One Hundred and Nineteenth Chapter

37. Hearing this, Sri Rama, with great joy and his hair standing on end, his eyes wide open, went to the sage. ||13||

11. Just as Vijay Balabhadra had gone to the sage Swarna Kumbha, so too, Sri Rama, served by the kings of the Bhu-khecharas and the Vidyadharas, and a bearer of great fortune, arrived with great devotion. ||11||

15. He bowed his head in reverence, offering salutations to the sage, who was worshipped by thousands of learned scholars. ||15||

16. Seeing that great soul, the cause of liberation, Rama felt as if he had been immersed in the ocean of nectar. ||16||

17. Filled with faith, he praised the supreme glory of the sage, just as the great king Mahapadma had praised the sage Suvrata. ||17||

18. The Vidyadharas, who were eager to serve in every way, adorned the place with flags, arches, offerings, and music. ||18||

19. After the night had passed and the sun had risen, Rama bowed to the sages and requested the Nirgrantha initiation. ||19||

20. He said, "O Yogindra! I am eager to live according to the Dharma, with all my sins removed and free from attachment and aversion, by your grace." ||20||

21. The head of the order of monks replied, "O King! You have thought well. What is the use of this perishable world?" ||21||

22. "It is indeed excellent to seek refuge in the Jina Dharma, which bestows eternal, unobstructed, and supreme happiness." ||22||

23. Hearing these words, Rama, who was detached from worldly things, circumambulated the sage, just as the sun circles Mount Meru. ||23||

24. Sri Rama, who had attained great enlightenment, who wore the armor of great compassion, and who was determined to destroy his karma with great patience, cast off the fetters of desire, burned the cage of attachment, broke the chains of greed, and shattered the pride of delusion. ||24||

With white lotus-like tender fingers, Kakutstha plucked out the hair from his head. ||27||
Rama, who had renounced all possessions, shone brightly. He was free from the clutches of Rahu, like the sun shining in the sky. ||28||
He was a resident of the abode of virtue, protected by excellent secrets, had attained the five assemblies, and was devoted to the five great vows. ||29||
He was the protector of the six types of living beings, the destroyer of the three types of punishment (of mind, speech, and body), free from the seven fears, and the destroyer of the sixteen types of pride. ||30||
His chest was adorned with the Srivatsa mark, his mind was devoted to the adornment of virtues, and he was steadfast in attaining the truth of liberation. Such Rama became an excellent Shraman. ||31||
Gods with invisible forms beat the divine drums, and the pure-minded devotees, eager to express their devotion, showered divine flowers. ||32||
When Rama departed from the great sin of household life, the benevolent friends, the divine beings, and Jatayu celebrated greatly. ||33||
When Rama was initiated there, the kings, all the earth-dwellers, and the Vidyadharas were filled with wonder and thought: "Here, Ramadeva, who was blessed by the gods, has renounced such difficult-to-renounce wealth and become a Muni. What temptation is there for us to renounce? We are devoid of the desire for vows." ||34-36||
Thinking thus, and lamenting within themselves about their attachments, many, filled with emotion, broke free from the bonds of home. ||37||
Shatrughna, having broken the fetters of attachment, destroyed the enemy of hatred, and freed himself from all possessions, became a Shraman. ||38||
Then Vibhishana, Sugriva, Nila, Chandranakha, Nala, Kravy, Viradhit, and many other Vidyadhara kings also departed. ||39||
Those Vidyadharas who renounced their knowledge...

Thus, when Sri Rama had renounced the world, sixteen thousand monks and more, O King, became monks. ||41|| Twenty-seven thousand principal women became Aryikas, following the path of truth, under the guidance of the venerable Shramanis. ||42|| Then, having received the approval of his Guru, Padmabhini Grantha, alone, free from the duality of pleasure and pain, took to wandering. ||43|| He used to dwell at night in the deep caves of the mountains, which were frightening to those with restless minds, and where the sounds of wild animals were prevalent. ||44|| He, the holder of the supreme yoga and the follower of the right method, attained the knowledge of clairvoyance in that very night. ||45|| By that clairvoyance, he saw the entire world, as it is, as clearly as a pure crystal placed in the palm of the hand. ||46|| Then, by that clairvoyance, he knew where Lakshmana had gone in the previous birth, but his mind, having broken all bonds, did not fall into any kind of delusion. ||47|| He thought, "Look, he spent a hundred years as a prince, three hundred years as a king, and forty years in conquering the world. ||48|| He ruled for eleven thousand five hundred and sixty years. ||49|| And he, having enjoyed twelve thousand years, minus twenty-five, went down, not being satisfied with the pleasures." ||50|| There is no fault of the two gods in Lakshmana's death; in reality, his time had come, under the pretext of his brother's death. ||51|| My birth and his birth, along with that of Vasudatta and others, have been intertwined in many different ways, all due to the influence of delusion. ||52|| Thus, Padmamuni, the mountain of vows and conduct, and the holder of supreme patience, knew all that had happened. ||53|| He, endowed with the highest auspiciousness, profound, an ocean of virtues, magnanimous, and devoted to the attainment of liberation, was a true seeker of liberation. ||54|| I tell you all who have gathered here, O Shrenik! Rejoice in the path of righteousness, where the best of the Raghus, Sri Rama, is. ||55||
Many of those who had taken the vows of renunciation and had received initiation, again attained the state of a Charan. ||40|| 
Gautama Swami says, "O King! At that time, when Rama took the vows of renunciation, sixteen thousand monks and more became monks, and twenty-seven thousand principal women became Aryikas, following the path of truth, under the guidance of the venerable Shramanis." ||41-42||

Padma Purana
Those who are devoted to the teachings of the Jinas with both strength and devotion, obtain a birth close to the path of liberation, where all their desires are fulfilled. ||56||
O noble people! Having obtained the treasure of the great teachings of the Jinas, abandon all the scriptures of the Kulangas, which are full of sorrow. ||57||
Those whose minds are deluded by false scriptures and who engage in deceitful and impure actions, like the blind, abandon the path of liberation and go astray. ||58||
Many people, lacking strength, see various tools as means and, saying, "There is no fault in accepting these," accept them. They are Kulangas. Foolish people promote them in vain. They carry a heavy burden, like those who are burdened with sorrow. ||59-60||
Truly, the Rishis are those who have no desire for possessions and no need to beg. Therefore, one should serve the pure, unattached, virtuous saints, who are endowed with good qualities. ||61||
Gautama Swami says, "O noble people! Having heard the story of Baldev, abandon all worldly pleasures and strive to become free from the desires that bind you to this world. This will prevent you from suffering the scorching heat of the sun of sorrow." ||62||
Thus ends the one hundred and nineteenth chapter of the Padma Purana, known as the Arsha, composed by the Acharya Ravishena, which describes the initiation of Baldev. ||14||

Thus, O King, even a Dharnendra with a billion tongues would be unable to describe the virtues of the yogi, Baldev. || 1 ||

After fasting for twelve days, the wise and virtuous great ascetic, Yogi Ram, went to the city of Nandastali to break his fast, following the proper rituals. || 2 ||

He appeared like a young sun, with his radiance, and like a second mountain, with his stability. Due to his peaceful nature, he seemed like a second moon, inaccessible to the sun. His heart was pure like crystal, and he was the best among men. He seemed like embodied Dharma, or the affection of the three worlds, or the joy of all beings, having attained oneness and stability. He was flooding the earth with the flow of his great radiance, and filling the sky with clusters of white lotuses. Seeing such Sri Ram, all the people of the city were filled with awe. || 3-6 ||

People said to each other, "Oh, what a wonder! Oh, what a wonder! Look, look! This is a form beyond the world, never seen before!" || 7 ||

"This is a great bull, extremely beautiful, coming here. Or, this is a wonderful human-shaped Mandarachal, with long arms hanging down." || 8 ||

"Oh, his patience is blessed, his strength and power are blessed, his form is blessed, his radiance is blessed, his peace is blessed, his liberation is blessed, and his speed is blessed." || 9 ||

"Who is this, so charming, coming from where? He is steady, with a peaceful gaze, focused, and has remained so for an entire epoch." || 10 ||

"What family has been adorned by this one, who has attained great merit? Whose house does he grace with his presence, and whose good deeds does he nourish with food?" || 11 ||

"Where in this world can there be another form like Indra's? Oh, these are the best of men, Ram, whose mountain of strength is unshakable." || 12 ||

Therefore, in accordance with your heart's desire, your birth, your actions, and your beliefs, strive to make your life and your deeds meaningful. || 13 ||

Seeing this, make your mind, sight, birth, karma, intellect, body, and conduct meaningful. Thus, the city dwellers, engrossed in the sight of Shri Rama, erupted in a beautiful, noisy clamor filled with immense wonder. ||13-14||

After that, as Rama entered the city, the streets, wide and long, were filled with groups of men and women, all engaged in activities befitting the occasion. ||15||

Many beautiful women, eager and holding vessels filled with various kinds of food, stood there, carrying heavy loads of water. ||16||

Many men, with their belongings firmly secured, arrived carrying full, beautiful water pots. ||17||

"O Master! Come here, O Master! Stay here, O Muni! Please grace us with your presence here," such excellent words spread everywhere. ||18||

Many people, their hearts overflowing with joy, their bodies trembling with excitement, roared like lions, their voices indistinct. ||19||

"O Muni! Victory to you, O Mountain of Merit! May you prosper and be prosperous," the sky was filled with such repeated words. ||20||

"Bring the vessels quickly, look for the tray, bring the golden plate quickly, bring the milk, bring the sugarcane, keep the yogurt nearby, quickly place the kheer in the beautiful silver vessel, bring the granulated sugar and candy quickly, fill this vessel with fragrant, cool water infused with camphor, bring the group of puris quickly, place the excellent shikharini in the pitcher according to the proper procedure, hey, clever one! Give the large, excellent laddoos with joy," such words of the women and men made the city completely absorbed in itself. ||21-25||

At that time, the people in that city were so engrossed in the commotion that they did not care for heavy necessities, nor did they even notice the children. ||26||

Many people, rushing through the narrow lanes, knocked down the people standing with vessels in their hands. ||27||

Thus, the city, with its people's hearts soaring high and their actions driven by the frenzy, became like a madman, all around. ||28||

The immense noise of the people and their brilliance shattered even the strong pillars of the city. ||29||

The elephants, whose temples had long held a vast store of ichor, were now overflowing with it, flooding the earth as it poured from their cheeks and ears.  ||30||

Horses with erect ears, their pupils centered in their eyes, having abandoned their grazing, stood with their necks raised high, emitting deep whinnies. ||31||

Many horses, having broken their bonds in fear, were followed by their terrified grooms, causing the people to panic. ||32||

As long as the people, eager to give charity, were agitated by the mutual commotion, the king, Prati-nandī, residing within his palace, was disturbed by the thunderous roar, like that of a raging sea.  He was suddenly filled with anger and exclaimed, "What is this?"  He then quickly ascended to the roof of the palace, accompanied by his retinue. ||33-35||

Seeing the chief sage, whose face was free from the blemishes and stains of the world, and whose complexion was as white as the moon, the king commanded many valiant warriors, "Go quickly and bring these excellent Muni-rajas here to me, with due respect and reverence." ||36-37||

"As our lord commands," they said, and then, parting the crowd, they went to the Muni-rajas. ||38||

Reaching them, they bowed their heads, folded their hands, and with sweet voices, their minds captivated by the Muni-rajas' radiance, they said, ||39||

"O Bhagavan! Please accept the desired offering. Our lord requests you to visit his home with your blessings." ||40||

"What need have you for food prepared by ordinary people, which is unwholesome, discolored, and tasteless?" ||41||

"Come, O great sage! Be pleased, and accept the desired food, free from anxiety." ||42||

Having said this, the noble women, who were eager to offer alms, were driven away by the king's soldiers, causing them great sorrow. ||43||

Realizing that this obstacle had arisen due to the manner of the offering, the Muni-rajas turned away from the king,

In the Padma Purana, the city's inhabitants were all distressed when the ascetic left.  Even more so than before, they were filled with sorrow.  ||45||
With hearts filled with anxiety, they made the entire world miserable.  The ascetic went to the dense forest and did not perform the pratima yoga. ||46||
Seeing such a beautiful, captivating ascetic, who was like the sun to men, even the animals were filled with great longing when he left. ||47||
Thus ends the 120th chapter of the Padma Purana, titled "The Distress of the City," composed by the Acharya Ravishena, known as the Arsha. ||120||

## The Twenty-First Century Chapter

**Verse 1:** The Muni-punga (great sage) Sri Rama, after observing the second fast of five days, made this vow: "In this forest, filled with herds of deer, I will accept only the alms that come to me. I will not enter the city for alms."

**Verse 2:** While the Muni was thus engaged in this difficult vow, a king named Pratinandin was captured by a wicked horse.

**Verse 3:** His queen, Prabhava, filled with grief, searched for the path of her husband's abduction, surrounded by a multitude of warriors. She mounted her horse and set out, her heart filled with anxiety.

**Verse 4-5:** "What will happen? How will I find my husband?" she thought, her mind racing. She rode swiftly along the same path, her heart heavy with worry.

**Verse 6:** As they were traveling, the wicked horse, carrying the abducted king, got stuck in the mud of a lake, like a householder trapped in a worldly snare.

**Verse 7:** The beautiful queen, upon reaching the lake, saw its lotus-filled waters and smiled slightly. She said, "Oh King, the horse did well!"

**Verse 8:** "If you had not been captured by this horse, how would you have found this beautiful lake, filled with flowers like those of Nandana forest?"

**Verse 9:** The king replied, "Yes, this garden journey has been successful, for you have arrived in the midst of this beautiful forest, which is impossible to tire of seeing."

**Verse 10:** Thus, with lighthearted conversation, the queen, surrounded by her companions, stayed by the lake.

**Verse 11:** After playing in the clear water, gathering flowers, and adorning each other, the king and queen sat down to eat.

**Verse 12:** At that moment, Muni-punga Sri Rama, who had completed his fast and was skilled in the path of action, arrived near them.

**Verse 13:** Seeing him, the king, filled with joy and trembling with excitement, stood up, along with his queen.

Having bowed down, he said, "O Bhagavan, please stand here." Then, having purified the earth, he worshipped it with lotuses and other flowers. ||11||
The queen, lifting a vessel filled with fragrant water, gave it to the muni, while the king washed his feet. ||15||
Then, the king, whose whole body was filled with joy, with great respect, placed in a golden vessel, kheer and other food, which was excellent in fragrance, taste, and appearance. Then, with great faith, he offered this excellent food to the excellent vessel, i.e., the muni. ||16-17||
Then, just as the desire of a compassionate person to give increases, so too, the food offered to the muni, due to the virtue of the excellent gift, increased in the vessel. Meaning: Shri Ram Muni was the holder of inexhaustible wealth, therefore, the food offered to him remained inexhaustible in his vessel. ||18||
Knowing the giver to be endowed with the virtues of faith, contentment, devotion, etc., the gods, with joyful minds, celebrated him in the sky, i.e., they performed five wonders. ||19||
A favorable, cool, gentle, fragrant wind blew. The gods, filled with joy, showered fragrant flowers of five colors. In the sky, there was a sound of various kinds of drums that captivated the ears. The excellent music of the apsaras mingled with the sound of the drums. The gods of the Kamadeva clan, filled with contentment, made various sounds and danced in the sky with various forms of dance. ||20-22||
"Oh, what a gift! Oh, what a vessel! Oh, what a ritual! Oh, what a god! Oh, what a giver! Blessed, blessed!" These words were uttered in the sky. ||23||
"Grow, victory, happiness!" These and other words of the gods, uttered in a loud voice, filled the sky-like pavilion. ||24||
Besides this, a rain of wealth, filled with various jewels, gold, and other excellent substances, fell, illuminating the ten directions. ||25||
Having received worship from the gods and the deshavrat from the muni, the king, with pure vision, attained glory on earth. ||26||
Thus, the king, along with his wife, who was submissive in devotion, having given a gift to a worthy recipient, experienced the ultimate joy, the fruit of having obtained human birth. ||27||
He became a khada. ||13||

## Ekavimsottarashatam Parva

Rama, having fulfilled the purpose of the time, performed **vivakta-shayya-asana** (meditation in a secluded place) in the middle of the night. His **tapas** (austerity) was so intense that he walked the earth like a second sun. || 28 ||

Thus ends the one hundred and twenty-first **parva** (chapter) of the **Padma Purana**, titled **Danaprasangabhidhanam**, composed by **Acharya Sri Ravishena**, known as **Aarsha** (ancient). || 121 ||

He experienced and considered human birth successful. || 27 || Here, Sri Rama, following the dictates of the **Agamas**, performed **vivakta-shayya-asana** in a secluded place and, with his **tapas** burning brightly, walked the earth in a way that seemed like a second sun had arrived. || 28 ||

Thus ends the one hundred and twenty-first **parva** (chapter) of the **Padma Purana**, titled **Danaprasangabhidhanam**, composed by **Acharya Sri Ravishena**, known as **Aarsha** (ancient), which describes Sri Rama's **aahar-dan** (offering of food). || 121 ||

In the one hundred and twenty-second parva, the Lord Baldeva, who is tranquil and free from envy, performed an extremely difficult penance that was impossible for ordinary people. ||1||

While the sun shone in the middle of the sky, he, who was observing the eighth day fast, wandered in the forest of Gopa for food, and the cowherds worshipped him. ||2||

He was a knower of the scriptures, such as the Vrata-Gupti-Samiti, a conqueror of the senses, affectionate towards the virtuous, devoted to self-study, and a doer of good deeds. ||3||

Even after attaining many great powers, he remained unmoved, supreme, a warrior against the enemy of delusion, and eager to conquer it. ||4||

Due to the power of his penance, tigers and lions became peaceful and looked at him with their eyes wide open in joy, and herds of deer with their necks raised looked at him with great love. ||5||

His mind was absorbed in liberation, free from desire and attachment. Thus, the Lord, adorned with excellent qualities, wandered in the forest with great effort, following the path of the Iryasami. ||6||

Sometimes he stood on a rock, or sat on a raised seat, and entered into meditation, just as the sun enters into the clouds. ||7||

He, the Lord, sometimes stood in a beautiful place with his arms hanging down, motionless like Mount Meru, and remained in a state of stillness. ||8||

Sometimes, the Lord Rama, who was extremely peaceful and possessed the wealth of detachment, wandered, looking at the earth, and the celestial nymphs who lived on the trees worshipped him. ||9||

Thus, the great sage Rama, who possessed an unparalleled soul, performed such a difficult penance that in this fifth age, called Dushma, other humans cannot even contemplate it. ||10||

Then, while wandering, Rama gradually reached the Kotishila, which Lakshmana had previously worshipped and lifted with his arms. ||11||

The great soul Rama, who had broken the bonds of attachment and was eager to destroy karma, ascended that rock and remained in a state of stillness throughout the night. ||12||

The hundred and twenty-second chapter. Now, the one who had used the eye of knowledge and was filled with great affection, the previous birth of Sita, Achyuta, was seen by the Indra of the Achyuta heaven. ||13|| At that time, he remembered his previous births and the great glory of the Jina's teachings in order. ||14|| Remembering, he realized that this ornament of the world, King Rama, was his husband when he was Sita in the human world. ||15|| He, the Indra, thought, "Oh, what a strange thing, the various activities of the mind! What was desired before is now desired differently." ||16|| "Oh, look at the different tendencies of actions, good and bad. The birth of people is strange, as is clearly seen here." ||17|| "These two, Balabhadra and Narayana, were wonders to the world, but due to the influence of their own karmas, they have obtained the upper and lower realms, that is, one will reside in the upper part of a realm and one will be born in the lower realm." ||18|| "One, the elder, is a diminished samsari and has a gross body, and the other, the younger, Lakshmana, is a full samsari and is suffering in hell." ||19|| "Lakshmana, whose soul was not satisfied with the enjoyments of the divine and human realms, is suffering in hell due to his sinful pride." ||20|| "This lotus-eyed, glorious Balabhadra, due to the separation from Lakshmana, has come to the refuge of the Jina." ||21|| "This beautiful one, who previously defeated external enemies with the Halaratna, is now striving to conquer the senses with the power of meditation." ||22|| "At this time, he is riding on the Kshapaka chariot, so I do such a thing that my friend becomes distracted from meditation." ||23|| "[And instead of attaining liberation, he is born in heaven.] Then, due to the love born from great friendship, I will happily go with him to Mount Meru and the Nandishvara island. The beauty of that time will be unique. Riding on the top of the chariot and accompanied by supreme glory, we will tell each other about our sorrows and joys." ||24-25|| "Then, I will go with Rama, who performs auspicious deeds, to bring Lakshmana, who has reached the lower realms, back to enlightenment." ||26|| "This and the same...

In the Padma Purana,
There, in the Nandana forest, where Rama, the righteous, abides,
The wind, laden with the pollen of many flowers, blows pleasantly.
The sound of birds, a delightful cacophony, fills the air.
The strong, restless swarm of bees buzzes around the fragrant Bakula trees.
The melodious cuckoos sing their sweet songs,
While the parrots, perched on the Palasha trees, play with their clear voices.
The mango blossoms, adorned with bees, resemble the sharp arrows of Kamadeva.
The forest, painted yellow by the Karnika flowers, seems ready for a game of play with yellow powder.
The Bakula tree, ignoring the intoxicating nectar of its flowers, showers its fragrance like a raincloud in the monsoon.
Then, the divine, self-effulgent, Kamadeva, assuming the form of Janaki,
Approaches Rama with a slow, languid gait.
That forest, a delight to the mind, is secluded, filled with diverse trees and flowers of all seasons.
Then, the great goddess Sita, wandering happily through the forest,
Suddenly appeared before the sage.
She said, "O Rama, I have seen you, wandering through the world, by the grace of great merit, however difficult it may be."
"O Lord, I, Suvadana, have fallen into the current of the river of love, filled with waves of separation. Please save me from drowning."
With her various gestures and sweet words, she understood the sage's unwavering mind.
She, whose heart was filled with the sin of delusion, who stood before the sage and moved from side to side,
She, consumed by the fever of love, whose body trembled, and whose red, full lips quivered,
The enchanting Sita spoke to him, "O God, I, who was once a devotee of the gods,
Now, having renounced my own dharma, I wander as an ascetic."
The other thoughts, the other considerations, Sita's life, self-effulgent god, came down from the Arunachala kalpa to the Sudharma kalpa with the other gods.
Then, moving from the Sudharma kalpa, he descended into that vast forest of the earth, which seemed like the Nandana forest, where the great sage Ramachandra was meditating.
In that forest, a pleasant wind, carrying the pollen of many flowers, was blowing, and the delightful sound of birds was heard everywhere.
On the Bakula tree, a strong group of bees was buzzing restlessly, and the group of cuckoos was making loud, sweet sounds.
The mynas, skilled in producing various beautiful sounds, were making melodious sounds, and the parrots, sitting on the Palasha trees, were playing, uttering clear words.
The mango blossoms, adorned with bees, seemed like the new, sharp arrows of Kamadeva.
The forest, appearing yellow due to the Karnika flowers, seemed as if it were ready to play with yellow powder.
The Bakula tree, ignoring the intoxicating nectar of its flowers, was showering its fragrance like a group of rainclouds in the monsoon.
Then, that self-effulgent, divine, Kamadeva, who could change his form at will, assuming the form of Janaki,
Approached Rama with a slow, languid gait, intending to go near him.
That forest, a delight to the mind, was secluded, filled with diverse trees and flowers of all seasons.
Then, the great goddess Sita, wandering happily through the forest,
Suddenly appeared before the sage.
She said, "O Rama, I have seen you, wandering through the world, by the grace of great merit, however difficult it may be."
"O Lord, I, Suvadana, have fallen into the current of the river of love, filled with waves of separation. Please save me from drowning."
When she understood the sage's unwavering mind with her various gestures and sweet words, she, whose heart was filled with the sin of delusion, who stood before the sage and moved from side to side,
She, consumed by the fever of love, whose body trembled, and whose red, full lips quivered,
The enchanting Sita spoke to him, "O God, I, who was once a devotee of the gods,
Now, having renounced my own dharma, I wander as an ascetic."

Then, the daughters of the Sadvidyadharas took me away. There, those learned daughters, giving various examples, said to me, "This renunciation is useless in this state, for this renunciation is truly only suitable for very old women." 43-44
Where is this youthful body, and where is this difficult vow? Can a mountain be pierced by the rays of the moon? 45
We will all go forward with you, and, O Devi, we will take Baldeva as our husband, taking refuge in you. 46
You will be the chief queen among us all. In this way, we will all play happily with Rama in Jambudvipa. 47
Meanwhile, thousands of daughters, adorned with various ornaments and endowed with divine splendor, arrived there. 48
Like the graceful gait of royal swans, they, born of the reaction of Sita and Indra, went near Rama. 49
Some of them were speaking sweetly, even more melodious than the cuckoo. Other daughters shone, as if Lakshmi herself were standing there. 50
They were manifesting divine music, a nectar for the ears, delightful to the mind, and accompanied by the sounds of flutes and veenas. 51
They had hair as black as bees, their radiance like lightning, they were very delicate and slender-waisted, they had large and prominent breasts, they were charmingly laughing with amorous smiles, they were wearing clothes of various colors and scents, they were speaking with various gestures and words, and they had filled the sky with their radiance. All those daughters, standing around the Muni, were creating infatuation, just as the daughters of the gods had done around the powerful Bahubali. 52-54
One daughter, seeking shade, went under a Bakula tree. Reaching there, she pulled the tree, causing the swarm of bees sitting on it to fly towards her. Frightened by them, that daughter went to the Muni for refuge. 55
Some daughters, engaged in a dispute, were taking sides. They asked the Muni, "What is the name of this tree?" 56

In the Padma Purana, 

(57) A girl, pretending to pick flowers from the Madhavi creeper, showed her arm root as her garment slipped. 

(58) Many girls, with their hands like swaying leaves and playing music with thousands of rhythms, were ready to form a circle and dance. 

(59) A girl, adorned with a scarlet garment as pure as water, wore a sky-blue skirt out of shyness. 

(60) Gautama Swami says that Rama was not disturbed by these actions, which captivated the minds of others, just as Mount Meru is not disturbed by the wind. 

(61) With a simple gaze and a pure soul, he was like a thunderbolt to the assembly of demons, entering the first stage of white meditation, like the rising sun. 

(62) His mind, filled with virtue, was extremely pure and focused on the Self, along with the senses. 

(63) Let external beings perform actions as they wish, but those who are wise in the ultimate truth are not swayed from their own good. 

(64) When Sītendra, desiring to disrupt meditation, attempted to create a divine illusion with all his might, 

(65) the highly pure sage arrived, ready to burn the endless accumulation of karma. 

(66) The Supreme Being, with firm resolve, destroyed the sixty types of karma and ascended the highest level of the क्षपक श्रेणी (kshapaka shreni). 

(67) On the twelfth night of the bright fortnight of Magha, the great soul attained Kevala Jnana. 

(68) With the emergence of the all-seeing Kevala Jnana eye, both the world and the beyond became insignificant to the Lord, like a speck of dust. 

(69) Then, the Indra, who had used the eye of knowledge, bowed down in reverence, trembling as the throne shook. 

(70) The great beings, who were present among the great assembly of gods, were filled with devotion and ready to worship the birth of Kevala Jnana.

One hundred and twenty-two chapters of the Padma Purana, known as the *Arsha*, composed by the Acharya Ravishena, describe the attainment of *kevala jnana* by Shri Rama Muni.

**Verse 70:** All the Indras, with great splendor, arrived there.

**Verse 71:** The *charana* sages, all the gods and demons, bowed down to Rama, seated on his throne, the destroyer of *ghāti karma*.

**Verse 72:** The entire *samavasarana* of the Supreme Lord, who had attained the form of the Self and was worthy of worship by all the lords of the world, was established.

**Verse 73:** Then, *Sitaindra*, known as *Svayamprabha*, performed the worship of *kevala jnana* and circumambulated the Muni twice, repeatedly seeking his forgiveness.

**Verse 74:** He said, "O Lord, forgive the fault committed by me, a fool. Be pleased and grant me the end of my *karma*, even if it is great, quickly."

**Verse 75:** Gautama Swami says, "Thus, the Lord Baldeva, with infinite radiance and beauty, and with a joyful countenance, attained *kevala jnana* and infinite happiness, the wealth of *samavritti*, through the supreme devotion of the *vajino*."

**Verse 76:** When the Muni Shri Rama, radiant like the sun among the sages, was about to go on a pilgrimage, the gods, filled with joy, quickly performed the worship, praise, and prostration of the Muni, according to their respective positions, and then departed.

## The Thirty-Second Chapter

And remembering the ocean of virtues of Lakshmana, the Lord of Sita, desiring to awaken Balukaprabha, set out. ||1||

Crossing the Manushottara mountain, inaccessible to mortals, and surpassing the Ratnaprabha and Sharkaraprabha lands, he reached the third land, Balukaprabha. ||2||

There he saw the extremely repulsive, unbearable suffering of the hell-bound beings, born from evil deeds. ||3||

The Asura son, Shambuka, who was slain by Lakshmana, was indulging in violent play like a hunter's son. ||4||

He would bind some hell-bound beings and kill them himself, have others killed by his servants, and make others fight each other. ||5||

Some, with distorted voices, were bound and thrown into fire pits, while others were impaled on thorny trees. ||6||

Some were beaten with iron maces by those standing around, while others were fed their own flesh and blood by merciless gods. ||7||

Some, broken by severe blows, lay on the ground, being devoured by dogs, cats, lions, tigers, and birds. ||8||

Some were pierced on spikes, beaten with heavy hammers, and others were thrown into jars filled with molten copper and other metals. ||9||

Some, bound to wooden stakes, were immobile and pierced with iron hooks, while others were forcibly fed molten copper and other metals. ||10||

Some were crushed in mills, others pierced with arrows, and still others suffered the torment of having their teeth, eyes, and tongues torn out. ||11||

Seeing such suffering of the hell-bound beings, the Lord of Sita was filled with immense compassion. ||12||

The twenty-third chapter of the Pर्व is about Lakshmana being taken out of the fire pit and being tormented by many Narakas from all sides. ||13|| He saw Lakshmana being tormented by the terrible waters of the Vaitarani, filled with vicious crocodiles, and being pierced by the sharp leaves of the Asipatra forest. ||14|| He also saw a terrifying Naraka, enraged and wielding a huge mace, ready to kill Lakshmana, while another Naraka was striking him. ||15|| He saw Ravana, with terrifying eyes, his body covered in filth, and his mouth wide open, being urged on by the Asura prince Shambuka, who was encouraging him against Lakshmana. ||16||
Meanwhile, the mighty Sitaindra arrived, scolding the wicked group of Bhavanavasis. ||17|| He said, "Oh, wicked Shambuka! What have you started? When will your cruel heart find peace?" ||18|| "Oh, lowly god! Give up your cruel deeds, be calm. What is the purpose of this pride, which is the cause of great misfortune?" ||19|| "Even hearing about the suffering of Naraka fills a being with fear. Why are you not afraid, seeing it directly?" ||20||
When Shambuka calmed down, Sitaindra was about to speak to him, but the Narakas, who were cruel, fickle, and hard-hearted, fled in all directions, terrified by the radiance of the gods. ||21-22|| Some of the miserable Narakas, with faces drenched in tears, cried out in sorrow. Some ran and fell into deep, uneven pits. ||23|| Sitaindra, comforting them, said, "Oh, Narakas! Don't run away, don't be afraid. You are all very distressed, come back. Don't be afraid, don't be afraid, stand still." Even after being told this, they trembled with fear and entered the deep darkness. ||24-25|| When Sitaindra repeated these words, their fear subsided somewhat, and they reluctantly paid attention. ||26||

Padmapurana
Those whose souls are consumed by great delusion, how can they not be born in hell? Being in this state, you do not know what is good for your soul. ||27||
Those who have not seen the end of the universe, who are devoted to violence, falsehood, and stealing the property of others, who are filled with fierce meditation, and who are hostile to those who are in hell, are the ones who reach hell. ||28||
Those who are attached to the right to enjoy, who are delighted by intense anger and other passions, and who are constantly engaged in harmful actions, are the ones who attain this kind of suffering. ||29||
Then, seeing the excellent god on the beautiful chariot, Lakshmana and Ravana first asked, "Who are you?" ||30||
Then the god told them the whole story of Rama and himself, and also said that according to karma, all these strange things are possible. ||31||
Then, hearing their own story, they attained enlightenment and their souls became calm. They lamented in this way, filled with sorrow. ||32||
"Alas! Why did we not engage in dharma during our human birth? Because of our evil deeds, we have attained this state." ||33||
"Alas! Alas! What terrible deeds have we done that bring suffering to our souls? Oh, the greatness of delusion, that it even surpasses self-interest!" ||34||
"You are blessed, O Indra, because you have given up desire for worldly things and, having drunk the nectar of the words of the Jinas, have attained the lordship of the gods." ||35||
Then, filled with great compassion, Indra said many times, "Do not fear, do not fear. Come, come, I will take you out of hell and bring you to heaven." ||36||
Then, girding his loins, Indra was ready to take them himself, but they could not be grasped. Just as ghee melts in fire, so too did those hell-beings melt and remain there. ||37||
Indra tried all means to lift them, but they could not be lifted. Just as reflections in a mirror cannot be grasped, so too could they not be grasped. ||38||
Then, filled with great sorrow, those hell-beings said, "O god, the karmas we have accumulated in the past are undoubtedly worthy of being experienced." ||39||

## The Twenty-Third Hundredth Chapter

**413**

Those who are greedy for worldly pleasures and have attained the suffering of hell, what can the gods do for those who are subject to the results of their own actions? **40**

Since the karma done by oneself has to be experienced according to its nature, O God! You are not able to liberate us from suffering. **41**

O Sītendra! Protect us, tell us what we should do so that we may not attain hell again. You are merciful to us. **42**

Then the God said, "That which is excellent, eternal, blissful, supreme, a secret for the foolish, famous in the three worlds, the destroyer of karma, pure, holy, the giver of the ultimate truth, never attained before, or if attained, not protected by the careless, unknowable to the unworthy, causing fear in the long cycle of existence, such is the noble and rare Right Faith, the greatest welfare of the soul." **43-45**

If you desire your own welfare, then even in this state, attain Right Faith. This Right Faith is auspicious, granting enlightenment in due time. **46**

There is no other welfare greater than this, nor was there, nor will there be. In its presence, the great sages become Siddhas, are becoming Siddhas, and were Siddhas in the past. **47**

As the great Arhats, the Jinas, have described the nature of the soul and other entities, so it is. Thus, to have firm faith with devotion is Right Faith. **48**

Although Sītendra had caused those in hell to attain Right Faith through his words, he was still grieving for them, being the enjoyer of excellent pleasures. **49**

Their former beautiful bodies, full of radiance and loveliness, were burnt by karma, like a new garden by fire. **50**

Seeing this, the whole world was astonished. Where did their radiant beauty, full of noble and graceful playfulness, go? **51**

He said to them, "Look, because of that small pleasure in the realm of karma, you have become immersed in this ocean of suffering by doing evil deeds." **52**

Thus, when Sītendra spoke, those who had been afflicted in countless births attained the supreme Right Faith, which they had never attained before. **53**

In the Padma Purana,
Having experienced that unbearable suffering, they were relieved.  They ascended and attained the human realm, seeking refuge in the Jina. ||54||
Oh, most supreme God, you have done us a great favor.  You have brought us together in this delightful, true vision. ||55||
Oh, great Sītendra! Go, go to your Āraṇācyuta kalpa.  Experience the vast fruit of pure dharma and attain liberation. ||56||
Thus spoken to, that Sītendra, though free from the causes of sorrow, still grieved inwardly, being endowed with supreme power. ||57||
Granting them solace, he, the great, virtuous Sūrendra, gave them a beneficial, enlightening discourse and ascended to his own abode. ||58||
His soul filled with fear, he, devoted to the four refuges, circumambulated Mount Meru many times. ||59||
Remembering the suffering of hell, that best of the gods, his soul trembling, even in his chariot, heard that sound, the wise one. ||60||
His heart trembling, his face like the moon, that wise Sūrendra was eager to descend again to the land of Bharata. ||61||
With a multitude of chariots, swift as the wind, filled with horses, lions, and herds of intoxicated elephants, ||62||
With celestial beings adorned in garments of various colors, their crowns shining with monkeys and garlands, riding various vehicles, adorned with flags and umbrellas, ||63||
Holding bows, arrows, swords, spears, and maces, those beautiful gods, accompanied by groups of apsaras, moved everywhere. ||64||
The sky was filled with the sounds of mṛdanga, duṇḍubhi, flutes, and vīṇās, mixed with shouts of victory, joy, and prosperity. ||65||
Then, Sītendra, the bearer of supreme good fortune, went to the refuge of Padma.  With folded hands, he bowed repeatedly in devotion. ||66||
Thus, with humility, he began to praise him, his mind firmly set on the means of liberation from the cycle of birth and death. ||67||

He who has subdued his self with the wind of meditation and the fire of knowledge, has burnt the forest of his birth. ||6||
He has slain the enemy of delusion with the trident of pure knowledge, and crushed the cage of attachment with the thunderbolt of firm dispassion. ||66||
O Lord, I am lost in the forest of existence, caught in the doubt of the present. Be my refuge, O Muniendra, O Bhavasudan. ||7||
O Rama, you have attained all that is attainable, you are the knower of all, you have accomplished your purpose, and you are the Guru of the world. Protect me, my mind is very troubled. ||71||
By diligently serving the teachings of Muni Suvrata Nath, you have crossed the ocean of existence with the boat of your great penance. ||72||
O Rama, is it right for you to leave me completely and go alone to that high, pure, and imperishable abode? ||73||
Then the Muni said, "O Suradhip, give up attachment, for liberation is for the one who is established in dispassion, and attachment leads to rebirth. ||74||
Just as a river cannot be crossed with a stone tied around the neck, so too, the world cannot be crossed with attachment. ||75||
He who is constantly absorbed in knowledge and follows the words of his Guru, can cross the ocean of existence with the boat of knowledge, virtue, and non-attachment. ||76||
Gautama Swami said, "O King, the wise should understand that the great and powerful Kevali knows the qualities of all things at all times, in the beginning, middle, and end. ||77||
O King, I will now tell you what Sitadeva asked and what the Kevali answered. ||78||
Sitadeva asked the Kevali, "O Lord, O Omniscient, where are those noble beings like Dasharatha? And what have you seen of the fate of Lavana and Ankush? Where will they be born?" ||79||
Then the Kevali said, "King Dasharatha has become a god in the Anat Svarga. Besides him, Sumitra, Kaikeyi,

Pam Purana
Janaka and Kanaka, both devoted to right faith, are equal in merit due to their own efforts and karma. ||1||
The two ascetics, Lavana and Ankusha, are equal in knowledge and vision. They are pure and will attain the imperishable state. ||2||
Hearing this, the great Indra was overjoyed. Remembering his brother, he asked about his well-being out of affection. ||3||
"Your brother too," was the reply. Hearing this, Sita Indra was saddened. He folded his hands and asked the sage, "Where was he born?" ||4||
Padmanabha (Rama) then said, "O Achyutendra! Listen to what I say about your brother's birth and his present state." ||5||
In Ayodhya, there was a wealthy merchant named Vajrang, the master of his clan, possessing countless riches and enjoying worldly pleasures with his beloved Makari. ||86||
He had many sons and lived a life of splendor like a king. Hearing of Sita's exile, he was filled with worry, thinking, "How could Sita, so delicate and adorned with divine qualities, have ended up in the forest?" He was deeply saddened by this thought. ||87-88||
This compassionate man, filled with disgust for the world, renounced worldly pleasures and became a disciple of the sage Dhuti. His initiation was unknown to his family. ||89||
He had two virtuous sons, Ashoka and Tilaka. One day, they went to the sage Dhuti to inquire about their father. ||90||
Seeing their father there, they too were moved by affection and renunciation and became disciples of Dhuti. ||91||
Dhuti, after performing intense austerities and reaching the end of his lifespan, attained the state of Ahamindra, leaving behind his disciples with a sense of longing. ||92||
Following their guru's instructions, the father and his two sons, all three ascetics, set out to pay homage to the Jina in Tamrachudpur. ||93||
On their way, they encountered a vast expanse of sand, fifty yojanas wide. They were unable to reach their destination and a long time passed. ||94||
Suprija (Suprabha) and Aparajita (Kaushalya), Janaka and Kanaka, all devoted to right faith, are equal in merit due to their own efforts and karma, residing in the same celestial abode. ||80-81||
The two ascetics, Lavana and Ankusha, are equal in knowledge and vision. They are pure and will attain the imperishable state, free from the dust of karma. ||82||
Hearing this, the great Indra was overjoyed. Remembering his brother, he asked about his well-being out of affection. ||83||
"Your brother too," was the reply. Hearing this, Sita Indra was saddened. He folded his hands and asked the sage, "Where was he born?" ||84||

There, having obtained a rare tree, comparable to the merit of giving to the worthy, those three ascetics stayed there, with its many branches and sub-branches. ||15||
Then, as the son of Janaka was going to the city of Kosala, he saw those three ascetics. And in his mind, this thought arose in this virtuous soul: ||16||
"These ascetics are staying here in this desolate forest for the sake of upholding their vows, but where will they get food to sustain their lives?" ||17||
Thinking thus, and with great generosity, he built a very beautiful city nearby, which was full of all kinds of provisions. He also showed places for the announcement-makers, cowherds, etc. to stay. Then, with his natural demeanor, he bowed to the ascetics with humility. ||18||
He stayed there with his family and, at the right time and place, he offered food with joy and justice to the virtuous people who came into his sight. ||100||
He satisfied all those ascetics who were in that desolate forest, as well as other virtuous people who were afflicted in the world and who had attained excellent self-control. ||101||
One should cite the example of Bhammandala, who was a devotee of Dharma, as a servant of those who are engaged in commerce in the ocean of merit, who are devoted to liberation. That is, the ascetics are like those who are engaged in commerce in the ocean of merit, and Bhammandala is like their servant. ||102||
One day, Bhammandala had gone to the garden and was lying down comfortably on a bed with his wife, Malini, when a sudden storm killed him. ||103||
Then, due to the merit arising from giving to the ascetics, he was reborn in the divine Kuru, south of Mount Meru, with a lifespan of three palyas and adorned with divine marks. ||104||
Thus, he, who possessed great brilliance, enjoyed the fruits of giving to the worthy in that divine Kuru, with his beautiful wife, Malini, and attained great expansion. ||105||
Those powerful people who satisfy the worthy by giving them food, attain the land of enjoyment and the supreme state. ||106||
Those men who have fallen from the land of enjoyment enjoy pleasures in heaven. The nature of those who reside there is that giving is the wealth of enjoyment. ||107||
Time has come. ||14||

In the Padma Purana, it is said that "Giving is the cause of heaven and liberation." Hearing this, Ravana, who had fallen into the sand, asked again.  

"Knowing that Lakshmana had fallen into the lower realms, Narayana said, 'Who will experience the end of evil? What path will the ten-headed one attain? What will I become? I wish to know this.'

"Having asked this question to the self-effulgent one, the omniscient one spoke words about the future and the possible future.

"He said, 'O Sita-Indra, listen! Ravana and Lakshmana, due to the fruition of their own actions, will experience the suffering of hell and, after emerging from the third hell, will be born in the city of Vijayavati, east of Mount Mandara. They will be the sons of Rohini, the wife of Sunanda, a Samyak-drishti householder. Their names will be Arhad-dasa and Rishi-dasa. These sons will be known for their good qualities, possessors of a very festive mind, and eager to perform praiseworthy actions.

"They will worship the Lord of Lords, the Jina, according to the rules of householders, and will be followers of the Anuvrata. In the end, they will die and become excellent gods.

"There, they will enjoy the pleasures of the five senses for a long time, and then, after falling from that state, they will be reborn in the same great family.

"Then, due to the power of their past giving, they will attain Hari-kshetra and go to heaven. After falling from there, they will be born as princes in the same city.

"Their father will be named Kumarakirti and their mother will be named Lakshmi. These two Kumaras will be named Jayakant and Jayaprabha.

"After that, they will perform austerities and attain the Lantva heaven. There, they will attain the position of a supreme god and enjoy the pleasures associated with that state.

"O Sita-Indra, you, having fallen from the Aranachya-chuta kalpa, will be born in the city of Ratna-sthala-pura in this Bharat-kshetra. You will be a glorious chakravarti, the lord of all jewels, named Chakra-ratha.

"Those two gods, Ravana and Lakshmana, who had become gods in the Lantva heaven, will fall from there and, due to the influence of the essence of merit, will be your sons, Indra-ratha and Ambhodara-ratha."

"For, it is the nature of the people there that they truly obtain wealth through giving. Giving brings happiness, and giving is the main cause of heaven and liberation."

This was your enemy, the mighty Dashavaktra, who had subdued three parts of Bharatavarsha. ||23|| One should not desire another's wife, this is the firm resolve. Even if one has to give up one's life, one should uphold truth. ||12|| He, becoming Indra-ratha, will be devoted to Dharma. He will attain many excellent births, excluding hell. ||25|| He will attain human birth, which is rare for all beings. He will acquire the karma of a Tirthankara, being virtuous. ||126|| Then, in turn, he will receive worship from the three worlds. He will destroy the group of enemies like delusion and attain Arhathood. ||12|| Having established his kingdom in Ratnasthalapura, he, the Chakra-ratha, will attain the position of Indra in the Vaimantaka heaven by the power of his austerities. ||128|| You, having fallen from the heaven, will be the first Ganadhara, glorious and prosperous, of that Jina. ||126|| Then you will attain the ultimate Nirvana, O Amreshvara. Having heard this, the lord of the gods, Sita, was filled with supreme joy, his inner self being filled with devotion. ||130|| This is the description of the being of Lakshmana, as narrated by the omniscient. He, becoming Ambodara-ratha, the son of Chakra-dhara, ||131|| will wander through many excellent births, engaged in righteous conduct. In the city of Shatapatra, in the Videha region, on the island of Pushkara, ||132|| Lakshmana, at the appropriate time, will attain his birth-ceremony. He will obtain the greatness of Chakra-pani and attain Nirvana. ||133|| I too, after completing seven years, will be free from rebirth and go where the virtuous ones like Bharata have gone. ||134|| Having understood the account of future births, the lord of the gods, Sita, free from doubt, filled with great devotion, ||135|| bowed down to Padma-nabha again and again. He went to worship the stupas, which were rising there, with great joy. ||136|| He worshipped the Nirvana-places of the Jinas with great devotion. He worshipped the images of the Jinas in the island of Nandishvara with great reverence. ||137||
And he will have a son named Megha-ratha. ||122||

In the Padma Purana, 
He, bearing the Jina in his mind, was constantly free from defilement. He attained Kevalya, the supreme bliss, and held it. ||13||
Considering his karma as defiled and impure, he was well-behaved and happy. He ascended to heaven, surrounded by a group of gods. ||13||
He went to heaven then, due to his ancient brotherly love. He saw the beings of the Bhamandala in Devakuru and spoke pleasantly with them. ||14||
In that Aranachya Utte Kalpa, which grants all desires, he resided with thousands of goddesses, the lord of their delight. ||141||
His lifespan was seventeen thousand years, and his height, along with Lakshmana's, was sixteen bows. ||142||
Gautama Swami says, "Knowing this difference between merit and demerit, it is best to abandon demerit completely and accumulate merit." ||143||
_Gautama Swami says, "O King! See, in the excellent rule of the Jina, the powerful Balabhadra, the holder of the Padma, who has attained fortitude, has defeated the mighty enemies, birth, old age, and death." ||144||
He, Ramachandra, by the grace of the Jina, has attained the eternal, supreme, and excellent bliss of Kevalya, which is extremely rare, free from faults, and unparalleled, having destroyed birth, old age, and death. ||145||
He, who is praised, honored, and worshipped by the Munindras, Devas, and Asuras, who has destroyed his faults, who is sung by hundreds of types of joy, and whose sight is difficult due to the abundance of flower showers from the Vidyadharas, that great Muni, Rama, attained the peak of the three worlds, the abode of the Siddhas, the ornament of all beings, by worshipping the Jain Dharma for twenty-five years with excellent methods. ||146-147||
O noble ones! Bow your heads to that Lord Rama, who is the holder of yoga, the holder of pure heart and pure feelings, who has destroyed the causes of worldly existence, who is a hero in conquering the enemies of karma, who is pleasing to the mind, and who is the best among the Munis. ||148||

He who conquered the youthful sun, who subdued the full moon's orb, who was exceedingly strong, who was worshipped by the Jiva-Indra, Sita, due to past affection or because of his righteous conduct, and who attained supreme prosperity,  salute that Muni-chief, Sri Ramachandra. || 146-150 ||

He who was the eighth among the Baladevas, whose body was exceedingly pure, who was glorious, who was the bearer of infinite strength, who was adorned with hundreds of thousands of rules, and whose all vices were destroyed. || 151 ||

He who was the bearer of many virtues and hundreds of thousands of excellent qualities, whose fame was exceedingly pure, who was generous, who was endowed with the lamp of knowledge, who was spotless, and whose brilliant fame spread throughout the three worlds, salute that Sri Rama. || 152 ||

He who destroyed the enemies of passions, who renounced all dualities completely, who attained the supreme lordship of the three worlds, who was devoted to the teachings of the Jina, who had eradicated the dust of sin, who was absorbed in right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, who was the destroyer of the world, and who was eager to destroy all suffering, salute that Muni-chief, Sri Rama. || 154-155 ||

The words "Cheshtita", "Anagha", "Charita", "Karana", and "Charitra" are all synonymous, therefore, Rama's actions are called Ramayana. || 156 ||

He whose heart is filled with wonder and joy, and from whose mind all doubts have vanished, such a person who reads or listens to the story of Baldeva with a devotional mind every day, attains an increase in his lifespan and accumulates merit. Even an enemy with a sword in his hand does not harbor any animosity towards him, and his anger subsides. || 157-158 ||

Salute. || 148 ||

This Padmacharitra, declared by the all-knowing Lord Vardhamana, is narrated by Indra-bhuiti, the disciple of Jambū, and further revealed by the eloquent disciple, the sage Kirti-dhara, for the benefit of the disciples of Jambū. This Padmacharitra, which enhances the well-being, virtue, and meditation, is the ultimate auspiciousness. ||167||

This Padmacharitra, a series of steps like the minds of the great sages who know all the scriptures, is full of good sayings, full of essence, and extremely wonderful. Indra-guru had a disciple, Divakara-yati, who had a disciple, Arhadyati, who had a disciple, Lakshmana-sena Muni, and I, Ravi-sena, am his disciple. ||168||

This Purana, which is excellent due to the causes of purity of right faith, is beneficial, vast, very clear, excellent, pure, prosperous, and a giver of the three jewels, is worthy of being heard continuously by wise people who desire self-benefit, as it narrates the greatness of the virtuous Sri Rama, who is of extraordinary prowess. ||169||

**Verse (1)**

The story of Balabhadra, Narayana, and their enemy Ravana is famous throughout the world. In it, the wise man, by intellect, accepts the good and rejects the bad. ||170||

The good character is one that increases virtues, and the bad character is one that increases suffering. The person who desires a particular object befriends that which is related to it. The one who desires virtues befriends good character, and the one who desires suffering befriends bad character. ||171||

This Padmacharitra, which I have described, is due to my devotion. ||166||

## Chapter 424: The Puranas

**172.** If even the king of the Vidyadharas, Ravana, who desired other women, met with misfortune and died of the disease of lust, what to speak of others who are addicted to sensual pleasures?

**173.** Even Ravana, who was constantly served by thousands of beautiful women, met his end due to his insatiable desires. To say that others will be satisfied is mere delusion.

**174.** Abandoning the happiness of one's own wife, the sinner who seeks pleasure in other women enters the vast ocean of suffering like a dry piece of wood.

**175.** O noble ones! Quickly go to the place where Baldeva and other great souls have gone, imbued with the love of the Jain teachings and having attained a strong and virtuous character according to your capacity.

**176.** By the fruits of good deeds, a being attains a high position and a treasure of great wealth. By the fruits of evil deeds, it suffers the misery of a bad rebirth. This is the nature of things.

**177.** Excessive anger, delight in harming others, and harsh speech are the first signs of evil deeds. Humility, learning, good conduct, compassionate speech, non-envy, and forgiveness are all good deeds.

**178.** Alas! No one gives wealth, health, happiness, or anything else to humans. Even if it is said that the gods give these things, why are they themselves so numerous in their suffering?

**179.** What is the point of saying much? O wise ones! With effort, understand the one supreme Self and the essence of karma, which is full of diverse results. Always delight in the means of attaining it.

**180.** O wise ones! We have described the means of attaining the ultimate truth in this text. Employ them with all your might so that you may cross the ocean of existence.

**Lakshana**, **Alankara**, **Abhidheya**, **Lakshya**, and **Vyanga** are the three types of **vachya**. **Pramana**, **Chanda**, and **Agama** are also explained here according to the context. One should understand all this with a pure heart.

This **Padma Charita** is said to contain eighteen thousand and twenty-three verses in **Anushtup** meter.

Thus ends the one hundred and twenty-third chapter of the **Padma Purana**, composed by **Ravi-Shena Acharya**, known as **Parsha**, which describes the attainment of **siddhi** by **Baldeva**.

## Tokak Prashasti

On the banks of the Dasha Sarita river, Paragram stands tall,
Where Liladhara, a Jain, resided, a devotee of the faith, they call. (1)

Three sons he had, devoted to the Jain Dharma's way,
Gali Lal, Nanda Lal, and Pyare Lal, adorned with righteousness, they say. (2)

Pyare Lal, known for his ocean of compassion, kind and true,
Gali Lal's wife, Janaki, a woman as pure as the morning dew. (3)

Three sons were born to them, radiant as the morning sun,
The eldest, Alambendu, known as Latore Lal, his journey begun. (4)

The middle son, wise and learned, was called Panna Lal, a name to revere,
When their father passed, their mother, with her sons, sought solace near. (5)

With the help of her relatives, she found support and strength anew,
Alambendu, alas, departed, his life cut short, a tragic view. (6)

Their mother, with her two sons, faced hardship and despair,
Panna Lal, with his revered feet, led them to a place of care. (7)

He entered the great university in Sagar, a place of wisdom and might,
His mother, with her second son, bore the burden of their plight. (8)

Panna Lal, in the university, learned with humility and grace,
He became a scholar, beloved by his teachers, in a short space. (9)

Loknath, then Chedi Lal, a scholar among scholars, bright and bold,
Kapileshwar, Mukund, and Babu Ram, with minds sharp and keen, we're told. (10)

Through their blessings, he mastered the ocean of sound and speech,
He excelled in the art of poetry, a journey smooth and sleek. (11)

He was a master of Samyaktv, a wellspring of compassion, pure and true,
Daya Chandra, a wise man, a master of Dharma and law, anew. (12)

He became a teacher of Dharma and law, a guide for all to see,
He was honored with the title "Shastri," in literature and philosophy. (13)

He earned the title of "Sahitya Acharya," a recognition well-deserved,
In his own university, he taught, by the learned and revered. (14)

He was appointed as a teacher, skilled in the art of instruction,
He carried the burden of his family, with love and devotion. (15)

But fate, cruel and unforgiving, took his middle son away,
His beloved brother, snatched from his side, on a fateful day. (16)

Overwhelmed with grief, he bore the weight of sorrow deep,
He pondered the mysteries of karma, and sought solace in his sleep. (17)

He wrote many books, a master of composition, clear and bright,
Some he edited, others he translated, with all his might. (18)

Suri Ravishena, in a beautiful language, wrote a tale,
The life of Padma Nath, a story that will never fail. (19)

What is its greatness? Read it yourself, and let your heart be filled,
With joy and wonder, as you delve into its pages, unyielding. (20)

Samyaktv will surely arise, from the study of this sacred text,
Panna Lal, with his commentary, the meaning he did dissect. (21)

The joy he felt while writing this commentary, words cannot express,
It resonated deep within his heart, a feeling of blessedness. (22)

On the seventh day of the week, in the language of the wise,
In the western hour of the night, his commentary did arise. (23)

In the year 2484, of the Vira era, it was complete,
This commentary, a delight to the wise, a treasure to greet. (24)

This ocean of ancient lore, adorned with waves of meaning profound,
I seek refuge in Ravishena, the great poet, renowned. (25)

May I never misinterpret the teachings of the Jinas, with my hands,
This fear lingers in my mind, as I strive to understand. (26)

Yet, I know, this ocean of knowledge is deep and vast,
I am but a small boat, burdened with the cares of life, amassed. (27)

At every step, I seek guidance, from you, my wise friends,
Forgive me, for my heart is not a betrayer of the Jinas' words, I contend. (28)

This book is complete.
1. Alambachandra.

Then time passes slowly
Then the city named Ratnapur

Then by Lakshmana the brave
Then Lakshmidhara himself
Or of the lord of light

Then mounting another chariot
Then having come together another time
Then seeing the city of Ayodhya

Then the soft-hearted one, alms
Giving and receiving, where
Unseen, the limit, rising
Up to the world
With the gods, in battles
Seeing Sita, Raghava
Today I will go quickly
From today, whatever
Today, I will send my brother
Today, I think this is a horse
Today, what has passed for you
Today, worshipped by the birds
Today, there is still merit

Having attained perfect vision
Standing, great in energy
They are established, well-contented
They are established, with great devotion
Now I wish to know
Now, with his own end not harmed
Now, seeing you, I
Now, on my head
Now, when the support is broken
Now, where is he
Completely controlled by the soul
Not a householder, with a householder
A city, with good qualities
I do not know Sita's
Who is the salt of love here
Named the salt of love
The salt of love said
Infinite vision, knowledge
Infinite, the supreme Siddha
Even of Ananta Purana
Immediately, below the dwelling
He also, the salt of love
Infinite in prowess
Infinite, not eaten, whatever
Infinite, infinite in qualities
Standing in the infinite light pit
Even by infinite time
Unexpectedly, a mouthful
Not united, such a good one
What is this story to you
No state, in liberation
With her, association
Of these two, of one
Diamond, lapis lazuli
And clothes, wealth
The highest jewel
The helpless, the unsteady, the poor
Of the helpless, the brothers
The helpless, God, do not make us

This is done, this I do
This is a picture, this is a picture
This is a question of good qualities
This is a beautiful earth
This is the region of the chest
This is the beautiful discus
This and other things collected
This is said to be eighteen
May the moon and the sun come
Like Indra's bow
Indrajit and Kumbhakarna
Indradhvaja, Shrutadhara
From the shadow of the blue sapphire, a blue sapphire earth, blue sapphire walls
From the lineage of Indra
This girl, whoever gets her
These, having arrived, quickly perish
For the protection of this
See these my arms, this is the king of the Vidyadharas
Cutting this vegetable, this tree
This, Shrihara, is yours always
This is the bad, bad hole
This is the crooked, sinful one
Leaving the beloved relatives, the beloved shade-giving, swollen, the beloved meeting, the beloved meeting, here in Jambudvipa, Pradyumna and Shambhu, they, for the sake of the happiness of this world
[ ई ]
This is the quality of the wise, knowing the law, endowed with the greatness of the earth, seeing Ishvara and Lakshmana

In the Padma Purana
The crop of the good, the auspicious
By action, the power
Such a reaction, the power
Such salt, that
- Even with such a one
Desired by all creatures, in all desired places
Lord, even so, what fault
Slightly raising the foot, slightly forward, the sign of the burden, being desired, secretly kill
[ 3 ]
It was said by him, his own army
It was said by them, thus it is
He was told many times by us
She said this, in her
Said, beautiful swan
Said, Dasharatha, again
Like leftover food, spread out
It is said, as it is, brother
From Ujjayini, even these
Udunatha's bright rays
Anxiety, the heart of the family, in the middle of the ear-piercing eyes
From the best, various
Answering, the ocean of existence
Some answer the ocean, with another on the northern shoulder
You stood up in the middle of this

Having crossed the lord of the two-wheeled chariots
Having crossed the intoxicated elephant

With the name of the high peak, rising, rising, as the people
By those falling, and by those falling
Becoming like Bhairava
Born with thick hair
Born with a jewel-studded discus
Born with a jewel, that
Born with a jewel-studded discus
Born in the golden-colored
With lotuses, water lilies, lotuses
Raised by the wind of the meteor
Meteors, hundreds, terrible
With full-blown lotus eyes
Ascending and descending
Send out the chariot, give
Covered with the armor of enthusiasm, those who give up, and flowers, having crossed the flowing, from the rising, whoever is yours

What is this artificial tooth?
Why is there doubt?
What are the two things that are seen?
Is this stable?
What is the reason for this?
What is this striving for?
What is this seen by me?
Are the enjoyments like the fruits of a tree?
With how much burden of the body?
How much time is there?
Indeed, the peace of Jinendra?
The name of the Kishkindha Kanda?
The king of Kishkindha, Vaidehi?
The son of the king of Kishkindha?
Those who are engaged in evil deeds, cruel -
The first evil deed, very long
The embryo like the egg of a hen
Deceived by bad scriptures
Twisted eyebrows
With twisted eyebrows, in the great mire of the family
With ornaments like earrings
From where did you get this beloved?
From where did you get this, Kalyani?
Two out of curiosity
Why is there fear here?
Why is this born of evil conduct?
Deceived by evil conduct
He is of evil intent
White, pot, not pot
The name of Kubera
Kubera, the lord of the sun
The desire of those two princes
As long as those two princes
The princes set out for Lanka
The prince, like the sun

The princes said as long as
The pot with the sound of the pot, cooked in the pot
The crow made a cry
O Kuru, be gracious, rise
Crying out, "They are doing it"
Let them protect with words
Let the external ones do what they desire
Let them have your company
This great family is mine
Family, character, wealth, beauty
Family, lineage, son
Family, lineage, birth, family, lineage, other
Going to the lotus grove of the family
The sound of the sword, fierce
The well-being of Ravana
In the city of Kusagra, O Devi
With offerings of flowers
The garden of flower joy
With flowers, the flowers of the Karnika
The reason, born of time
The lord of the place of the Kucara
Having attained the difficult human state
What I did, for whom I was
Done by force, something
Done, with soft music
Wounded, with praise
Having tied the knot
Having gone out after begging
This is done, I am doing it
Who did you do this?
Done there, with the morning sun
Of the deed done in the world
Having made a city like heaven
Having folded hands, the earth
Having folded hands, these
Having folded hands, praising
Having folded hands, humble

Evil deeds have been done
The god of death said
The face of death, the self
With the speed of the face of death
The soldiers of the face of death
Even the fear of death
Then the face of death spoke
As long as with death
All the actions have been done there
To do this, so much
The distinction between what should be done and what should not be done
Artificial, artificial in this
Knowing that this is artificial
Having placed the palm of the hand on the head
Having placed the palm of the hand, Sita
Having made a noise, fire
Having made the sound of laughter
Having done that, that city
Having done great worship there
Having done great compassion
Having placed the hand on the cheek
Having done association with dharma
Having done this wearing
Having done praise, proof
Filled with a pitcher, a pitcher
On the dark fortnight, then night
Of Kekaya's delight
By the boon of Kekaya
Some are on the backs of tigers
Some are pierced on spikes
Some have attained the state of a listener
Some of the king's father

Some, bearing strength, ..76 even the wealthy one speaks thus
Some in the class of the Tugra Vidya, some have hatred in enjoyments, even the wealthy one, you count
The answer of the Rudra to this, some are tormented in machines, 410 the wealthy one, I am the great demon
The small cloud-family-owner, some are tormented by the horse-army of the Yavana-deva
The king of Manjalipura, some, abandoning the lord
From anger, he does something, 15 safely, of the body of Ravana, 22 some, filled with flowing- 255
Of the cranes and the chakravakas, 282 the earth wanders by him, 141 some, saw the sign- 322
Tormenting, even with great effort, 266 disturbing, then, the generous, 260 with the bangle-bitten roots, 61 somewhere, the sound of the kalakala- 281 the wicked, bad person, blameworthy, only the effort is here, 387 somewhere, the assembly of the Pulinda- 208
[kha] only knowledge is produced, 176 somewhere, by the small-moving ones, 208 filled with great jewels, 116 the saffron-seat, on the head, somewhere, in the high mountain
By the movement of the sky and the land, 222 Kaikaya, Kaikayi, the goddess, 136 somewhere, in the village, in the city, in the forest, 207 the wicked, wind-blown- 287 Kaikayi, surely, is dressed
Somewhere, covered by the dense clouds, 207. The wicked words, like frost, 231 Kaikayi's son, then, the wicked
Somewhere, the broken-string, 261 the distressed one, spoke to him, the moon, 336 the son of Kaikatabha, and his light, 330 somewhere, he releases the roars, 281 the distressed ones, are given sweet, 62 in the Kailasa-peak-like
The golden-bells-net, 3 the king of the birds, as is proper, 68 some, by the sun's rays, 32 in the gate, the supreme enjoyments, 314 the birds, even, are difficult to obtain, 229 who knows, dear, the earth's geography? 53 you will go, the wise one, 229 famous, something, the wise one, 273 what fault is it, that I have abandoned, 227. What is the body, what is the Jainendra, 320 who is this, who has started the pride, 27 where is he, such a hero, 314 in the sky, the world of the birds, who is this, here, from where, 367 where are they, lord, all-knowing, 415 in the Ganga, when it is full, 127 with the noise, of the people, 368 for a moment, thinking, the lotus-faced one, 275 go, go, ahead, the path, who has gone, satisfied
For a moment, the lions, for a moment, the fire, 20 going, his strength is terrible, who, by the desire for jewels, by name, 144. The moment, the body is motionless, 111 for a moment, here, in my country, 205
The elephant, afraid of the world, this, 153 who, for one day's kingdom, 357 the Kshatriya, of the noble family, 125
The elephant-king, like the neck, the young-vow-bound, she
168 bearable, what is done, something- 351 the Ganin, of the Virajinendra, 350 the continuous-circle, this is the speech, 330 forgive me, lord, the fault, 406
The Ganin said, the Magadha-named, in order, by the path, obtained, 338 the Ganin said, if Sita, 103 in order, and by the grace, with patience, the Arya-Ganin, in the middle, 316
Gone, the giver of the Agama-rule, 360 in order, the virtuous-share, the alkali-belly-ocean-ended, 122
The speed, this is, of the heroes, 76 the buying-selling-attached one, 265 the earth, with the dust-covered body, 232 gone, and the sun, that, the flesh-curse-punishment, in the beginning
Thrown, thrown, with great anger, 265 being done, this is the worship
Throwing, the nectar-fruit, in the well
210
Going, and they, the three, 333 by play, even, what is done, he bore, 235 the diminished ones, in the self-virtues, 37 going, to Nandishvara, with devotion, 12 the play-house, he saw, 48 going, he informed, the play-desire-mind, this
The milk, bring, the sugarcane, 368 going, thus, tell the messenger, you, the play-lover-minded ones, 369 the crushed-enemy-army, the fierce- 25 the mace-and-disc-collision

I am the lord of Trikuta, the fierce lord of the three parts,
A knower of three, wise and deep,
From the status of a god to that of a human, by the gods, demons, and Gandharvas,
Three-footed, beautiful with cuts,
Three-palyas of a muhurta, three-times presented,
When three yamas have passed,
At the three junctions, those who are devoted to worship, three thousand women,
To please the Chinese, the three worlds, O Lord, the three worlds, the act of shaking the three worlds,
For the welfare of the three worlds,
You are the one who brings welfare to the three worlds, you are the doer of the pilgrimage of unrighteousness,
You have become the mother of heroes, you are here in the land of Bharata,
You are indeed blessed, O Indra,
By you, sixteen years,
By your own human form, by you, these are deprived,
You meditate on you, with various peace,
Who else will come quickly -
Quickly said thus, quickly go to your father,

In the Padma Purana,
The goddess Maithili tells you,
[D]
With a terrible face,
The commander of the army, the commanders, five punishments, the supreme gift given,
Given battle, for a long time, with strength,
Given orders, before,
Given, also, with a chariot of jewels,
Given, the letter was announced,
Giving them satisfaction,
He saw this in confusion,
I give you a great elephant,
Some gave, having obtained,
Narayana also gave the order,
He, with a troubled mind,
He thought, this king,
Teeth, insects, complete, teeth bed, relying on, teeth house, variegated, teeth house, shadow, teeth, of the battle-fierce, taming, giving, compassion, husband and wife, honey, they desire,
Show compassion, O great sage,
Compassion, not forgiveness,
The dharma which has compassion as its root,
The beloved, breaking the fetters,
The beloved, eight thousand,
The Darigandhara, the Sauvira,
This, with a bed of darbha grass, seeing, knowledge, happiness,
The heroes, standing in the sight,
I show you today, the state, ten, seven, and years,
Ten-limbed enjoyment, city, ten-limbed enjoyment, city,
Ten-faced, if you are pleased, ten-faced, friend, among,

Placed on the forehead
The greatness of the salt-goad
The salt-goad, the
Goad-born, with a tail-hand, not, the tail-hand, also, thus, I will cherish, that which is there
Smearing, as it were, with beauty
The one who has risen from the Luncher, with rough hair, also, this
Polluted, impure, karma, the lord of the world, having released, alone
The chief of the guardians of the world, along with the guardians of the world, the guardians of the world, born, heroes

Speak the word, O third

That word, of his, worshipful
The thunderbolt-neck, his son
The thunderbolt-thigh, within the house, the thunderbolt-thigh, the chief of
